<p>— 列山</p>
<p>德國人的日本熟</p>
<p>轟動一時的「德日反共協約」已經簽訂有兩個星期了，就在這短短的兩個星期中，日本人，無疑的已經算是世界上最幸福的人種。因爲從公佈這個條約的那一刻起，一部分德國人突然在人間發見了一個新的種族，一個新的向志，一個同德國一樣値得人類尊敬的國家。德國人的喜悅，尤其是日本人的喜悅，到處都充滿着愉快的空氣。假如你碰到一個年輕的國社黨黨員，就說他知道你是個中國人，可是這種快樂的。情仍自禁不住要流露出來，他會對你說這仙協的在世界歷史上的意義，同時他會特別提醒你，日本人種是如何的優秀。終於他斷定，就在幾年以內世界上老大的國家都會受自然」的濟汰。他的眼睛裏發出了光輝，好像在預示『新時代已誕生了！』這種坦白的說法，是算德國人誠實的地方！不過你是一個中國人，你知道中日的關係，你知道德國工商業界注重中國的友誼，同時你更知道就是德日眞的軍事同盟，德國也不會有多少軍力可以開到遠東來帮忙日本對付中國。你吿訴他這一切，你提醒他，德國別再同歐戰時一樣又上人家一决當。他想了一想說；也許日本人會利用德國，但安知德國不也就利用日本？好了，中國民族，中國人的友誼在他眼中，自然是一錢不値的。這就是『第三帝國』靑年的國際政治觀念，我們是佩服德國人的勇氣的，但始終找不出來德國有得罪中國的必要。目前中國是一個已經統一了的國家。想把中國當做殖民地的夢，連英國『死硬派』都已改變了見解，父何况歐洲其他國家！一年來德國對華貿易激增，我們相信德國不乏明達之士會顧慮到他們自己的經濟利益的。</p>
<p>事實上，在德國也只有一部分人歡迎這個協的，最少不是所有的德國人。理由大家還沒有忘記歐戰時所得到的敎訓。雖然這一部分人的努力宜傳，已是可驚的。聽說，柏林社交界中的親日論調，比日本人還要日本化。他們將這種觀念普傳到民間去：第一，日本是反俄，反共的，與德國同一的命運。共次，日本人也是世界上優秀的人種。但最重要的，還是一般德國人相信，萬一德俄發生戰事時，可以得到日本的實力帮助。於是乎一九三六年的冬天日本人突然變成了德國人的『同志』，或者更多一點。日本熱是這個年頭的社會現象。連少女碰到路上黃色臉孔的異國人時，都不再說『日本鬼』（Jabst）了。她們會用同情的聲調，會用一種少女們特有的同情聲調說：『呵！那是一個日本人！』</p>
<p>爲的目前這種親日現象是由上而下的，所以德國政黨當局這兩個星期來特別感到忙碌。例如德國元首希特勒先生，他除了設宴招待日本駐德大使館人員慶祝協的放功以外，連柏林日本學院成立十週年紀念他也特別發出一個賀電。再如德四駐英大使李班特洛勃先生，他往返倫敦柏林，單爲了簽訂這個協的不知道花費了多少苦心。他的尊容我們教近在新聞影片中到處可以看釗，此外他還發了宜言證明這個協的的價値。再如國社黨國外政治部部長盧森堡先生，他是目前主持德國外交政策的要人，日本同豐通訊社甚至於不惜由遙遠的東京在無綫電話中同他作了一次「訪問記」。當然最忙的人還是德國宜傳部部長哥白爾司博士，他不但計劃全盤宣傳事宜，要對人民作公開的演講，特別重要的，德國報紙在他指導之下，才有一致的陣勢去鼓吹德日親善。</p>
<p>日本人是一個優秀種族，就希特勒先生也是這種見解。世界運動會閉慕後他曾告訴一位記者，當他——希特勒先生，看到日本那位馬拉松優勝者跑步時的姿勢，不禁使他想起這個令人欽佩的日本種族。不過，希特勒先生這個例子引用得有些不宰，事前他沒有査明到底這位優勝者與日本種族的關係，所以把這個前提弄錯了。因爲這個優勝者並不是「優秀」種的日本人，而恰恰是被道種「優秀」種壓迫的高麗人。</p>
<p>德國人說，日本人是一個優秀的種族，在這種空氣中日本人怎麽說呢？乘日本學院十週年紀念的機會，一位日本敎授作了一篇「日本人的來源」的演講。他不承認日本人是蒙古人，馬來入，高麗人等的混合種。理由，據日本現代言語學家的硏究，日本文是一個獨立的文字。一種文字在世界上別的國度裏决尋找不出的。因此日本人是一個特殊的種族，這就是這位敎授的結論。</p>
<p>據說，報紙上的論調是代表民意的，就是所謂與論。於是我們要觀察德日親善的現象，自然也只好向德報中報尋材料，特別是國社黨報紙。歸納這這批報紙論調，可以得到一個公式，就是：日本是一僩文化「古」國，日本是一個軍備强國，日本是一個反共，反俄的先鋒，日本人是同德國人一樣的優秀……諸如此類。有的人還替這批記者担心，恐怕不久這種讚揚的材料就會寫完。雖然，熟悉德國新聞界情形的人，却又不能不同情這批記者，自然並不止爲了「同行」的關係。</p>
<p>其實，人家反共，反俄，對日親善，說來好像同咱們中國人又有什麽關係！假如人家不會妨碍及中國的利益，咱們决沒有眼紅的理由。但事實上是否如此！據德國駐華大使對於中國政府的聲明，德日協約决不妨碍及中國的利益並中德邦交的友好，自然，這不但我們的希望，甚至於我們也能够了解德國政府的誠意。不過根據德國報紙對於最近中日事件的論調並所登戰的電訊看來，最少還沒有辦法消除我們的懷疑。</p>
<p>最近兩星期來德報所刊登的遠東電訊幾乎全由半官式的德意志通訊社一手包辦。電訊的來源十分之九來目東京，只十分之一出自該社駐華記者手中。而東京來的電訊內容幾乎無異日本同盟社的傳聲筒。不但關於事實方面引用日本的立塲，就連文句上也是如此。例如叙述最近日本駐華大使與張外長交涉的經過，該社對於日大使稱呼「大使」，對於張外長稱張」。一位外交部長的身份還不及一位大使，該社駐日記者的禮貌，似乎不敢說是常態。尤其使我們難解的該社的電訊常有意無意中在替日本訴寃，好像日本的行動是由於中國逼成（—）的結果。我們曾同情過歐戰後受人家壓迫的德國，想不到人家此日對於我們日前的掙扎，一個民族圖生存的掙扎也不肯加以公正的批評！大的因爲中國政府目前還沒有一種新聞政策，於是乎人家可以不必顧慮到這一些，自然！此電訊更離奇的，就是各報的論調。例如國社黨的機關報民族觀察報新近發表了一篇文章，引用一九三二年李頓爵士向國聯的報吿書，說是中國共產黨聲勢浩大，擁有九千萬左右的人口。言外之意，好像中國過早總要赤化，唯一拯救遠東的方法，只有讓日本來統治中國。這位記者駐華多年，對於中國目前的狀况，共產黨的勢力如何，白然十分明瞭。爲什麽不顧良心，抹殺事實與日本人一鼻孔出氣？是否因爲德日同盟所以非替中國造些謠言不可？反對蘇俄，反對共產黨這不關我們的事情。但侮辱到中國時，中國人民是無法坐視的。</p>
<p>另外一家國社黨黨報有一篇社論，甚至於說咱們中國人不應反日。理由蘇俄佔了中國的外蒙古，新疆，中國不說話：日本佔東三省，熱河一帶，中國就拼命反抗。好像中國對日，對俄不算公平。這種干涉到別國內政的論調也許可以得到日本人的歡心。但同時他們也得記起，這對於中國恰恰是一種侮辱。</p>
<p>最近有不少謠傳，德國將繼意大利之後，承認滿洲僞國，問題只在於日本能否拿得出適當的交換條件來。這不但是一個給德國政府證咀中德友好的機會，同時在我們中國人看來，對於我們也是十分重要的，最少會使我們明瞭，我們究竟站在會麽地方！（十二月十日）</p>

<p>— 南靈</p>
<p>藏相的這種話，如果不是官樣文章，那就未免過於樂觀了。依目下的國際情勢看，國防費是只有逐年膨脹的。不僅是陸海軍的軍事費，就是做爲廣義國防費的產業振與費。以及國民生活安定費，也難免不繼續增加。若果不再增稅，也不增發公債，則這些勢必逐年膨脹的經費，將從何處去籌措呢？</p>
<p>現在的日本，無論各方面，都趨向統制化了。許多日本人，在談話中，也好像譏諷似的，自稱爲「統制時代」。統制的結果，將能令一部份產業，萎縮不振，一部份產業，頓形活躍。要想令社會做到眞正的景氣，那是很難的。縱令能够景氣，能做到自然增收，但因增稅的結果，物價上騰，歲出的增加也必然不能避免。因此，財政當局的樂觀論調，事實上，只是因爲旣已把空前未有之重壓，加在大衆身上了，所以不能不對大衆，預許一個將來的美夢。實際的日本財政狀况呢？那是一年復一年，絕不能减輕大衆的負擔的</p>
<p>據日本商工省一九三七年度的貿易觀察：認爲一九三七年度的日本貿易，當較一九三六年史爲好轉。以龐大之預算案之成立爲根幹，軍需工業必大形興旺，做爲農村的二大支柱的米和蠶繭，也將因此而增加銷路。同時，一般中小商工業者，也必將因軍需工業之活躍而景氣。所以，一九三七年度的日本金融，是很可樂觀的。</p>
<p>這也許可以成爲事實吧？、但也只不過是一個粉飾的事實吧了。而且，要實現這個粉飾的事實，也就不能不施行急激的統制强化。</p>
<p>第一·是貿易的統制强化。目下正在進行着的聯繫日本，滿洲，朝鮮，和華北的「帝國經濟會議」，就是講求怎樣防止明年的貿易惡化的。謂所「滿洲國產業五年計劃」，以及「華北經濟開發」，都是確立凖戰時經濟體制的基礎的。目前的世界，正走到資本主義的末期。資本主義社會的景氣行進曲，是絕不能如意發展的。要令牠昻揚，令牠能適應準戰時的稅制，那是非實行貿易統制强化不可的。</p>
<p>第二·是資金的統制强化。在增發公債之後，大藏省對於匯兌管理，必然要採取更强化的方針，以防止資本逃避。一方面史强化低金利政策，與貿易統制政策相呼應，以統制金融資本。用行政的手段，將公債從自然的消化方式，轉移　人爲的消化方式，以確定公債國策之基礎。</p>
<p>第三·是產業的統制强化。以軍需工業爲中心，從各柿觀點，實行各種產業的統制。對於輸出輸入的各種產業形態，以及原料和利潤等，都施行强度的統制，以造成能適應軍需工業繁榮下之跛脚景氣。</p>
<p>由於這些統制政策的强化，一九三七年度的日本財政，自然將以一個新的姿態而出現，這新的姿態是：</p>

<h3 id="c40">海約滿期的前夕 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>再過兩天。英美日法意五國所締結的華盛頓和倫敦兩海軍條約都要滿期了。我們知道這兩個條約是大戰以後比較算。得成功的軍備限制條約。前者成立於一九二二年。除限制締的國的主力艦噸數外。更維持英美日三國在太平洋上的均勢後者成立於一九三〇年。限制締的國的補助艦的噸數。十餘年來。各締的國雖仍在積極擴充軍備。從事海上的爭覇。但總以受條約的拘束。不能不有相當的限制。現在這兩個條約旣將滿期失效。各海軍國家自然要積極準備。重又無限制地擴充軍備。展開海上的爭覇戰了。</p>
<p>在海的滿期以前。英美法日意五國雖曾紆回曲折地恊商着海的滿期以後限制軍備的辦法。但因與會各國的利害對立。僅僅產生了英美法三國協定。這個協定。因爲沒有日意等國參加。在作用上。當然不能和華盛頓倫敦兩海的等量齊觀。而協定中更規定着倘締的國以外的國家。積極擴充軍備超過華盛頓海的所規定的應有比率時。則締的國家也可解除條約義務。自由競爭。這種規定在日意正要解除條約義務。積極擴充軍備的時候。實無異爲擴軍開了一個方便之門。其次。英國雖又和德國及蘇聯締結海軍協定。規定該兩國的海軍力和英國的比率。但英國所許德國保有的海軍力。旣尙未完全爲法國所接受。而英國又允許蘇聯在日本未加入三國協定的條件下。可以自由建設遠東的海軍。這種勾心鬥角的外交。不但無從限制軍備的競爭。還足以促進軍備擴張的速率。</p>
<p>果然英國於三國協定成立後。卽就宣佈保留艦齡逾限的驅逐艦四萬噸。最近更礙增建主力艦五艘。美國除積極造艦外。也步着英國的後塵。宣佈保留艦齡逾限的驅逐艦五萬九千噸。法國亦不甘落後。雖在財政極度窘困的時候。仍不惜舉巨債以擴充軍備。實施造艦計劃。日本在兩年前就宣佈廢棄海約。積極儲備資料。準備於明年度起。實施大規模的造艦計劃。以期軍力達到和英美相等的地步。而明年度的海軍預算。兌達六萬八千萬元。開空前的紀錄。。意國在這兩年中。除建三萬五千噸的主力艦二艘和輕型艦多艘外。現在尙在進行建築的各種艦艇還有五十餘艘之多。至於德國和蘇聯則正在加緊建築英德和英蘇協定容許保有的海軍力。不但如此英美日三國在太平洋上的重行設防問題正在展開。而英意在地中海的爭覇。也日趨積極。後一問題雖或可因英意地中海君子協定的締結而暫時和緩下去。但前一問題却日趨嚴重。不久以前。英國曾有維持華盛頓海約第十九條規定。限制太平洋設防的建議。可是這個建議。不但不爲日美所接受。而最近美國更在太平洋的中途島和威克島建設空軍根據地。以爲日本擴軍的對策這樣一來。美國將來在西太平洋作戰就要便利許多。這又使日本的擴軍受到一個重大的刺激。</p>
<p>總之。海軍國的擴軍競爭。是日趨明顯了。這種競爭很容易演變而成海上的爭覇戰爭。在兩大海的滿期以後。用什麼方法來减輕這種海軍競爭的危險性。該是關懷世界和平的各國政治家所焦慮的問題罷。</p>

<p>— 本報駐歐記者　列山</p>
<p>九·為國犧牲—戈林將軍林重減輕了二十磅</p>
<p>兩三年來，每年冬天德國總要鬧幾次「民食恐慌」，例如缺乏奶油·鷄蛋·肉類·等等，有的人說，這是德國軍事當局預定的計劃，作一種國防的試騐，有的人說，原因在於德國缺乏外匯，所以奶油等的輸入减少。國社黨人對內宣傳的名言是：「以槍砲代替奶油」，國防比一切重要，希望人民忍耐。一九三六年的冬天到了。戈林將軍恰於這時候受希特勒的任命，全權辦理德國的四年經濟計劃事宜。戈林將軍的第一篇演說，大意是勸告人民「節衣縮食」與他合作，共同渡過這個難關。德國缺乏原料，而別的國家在這一點上面不能够了解德國的苦衷，所以德國被迫到非利用自己的化學工業去發明一種原料替代品不可。他更保證四年以後德國的人工工業原料一定可以做到自給的地步。</p>
<p>對於民食問題—缺乏鷄蛋，戈林將軍說，自然生來就是這樣的，母鷄有時下蛋，有時不會下蛋，反過來說，人們也沒有天天要吃鷄蛋的理由。第二天一家國社黨黨報在這一段上加了一個大字標題，「政府可不能下蛋」</p>
<p>其次奶油，戈林將軍說，他近來也因常得不利奶油，體重已减輕了二十磅。不過這句話第二天德國各報都沒有登載。</p>
<p>戈林將軍的體重，據猜測，大約有兩百五十磅—</p>
<p>十·再談戈林將軍</p>
<p>德國國家社會黨許多要人中最通俗的一位要算戈林將軍戈林將軍身兼無數要職，他的頭銜，普魯士邦總理·航空部部長·空軍上將·德國議院議長·政治警察總監·第一任德國森林總管·第一任德國獵人總督·四年經濟計劃全權執行人……等等，此外，他是普魯七邦戲院總管，他去年新結婚的夫人是一位女伶。</p>
<p>戈林將軍愛好軍裝，而他的地位恰恰有無數服裝可以更換，於是在柏林社交界中或者德國畫報上，常可以看到戈林將軍並他各種各式的軍服。戈林將軍愛好動章，而一大批動章也同軍服一樣，時常離不了他。中間有一個大動章是他在歐戰時得到的。歐戰時，戈林將軍是一個十分著名的空軍軍官。</p>
<p>戈林將軍在第三帝國的地位只次於希特勒，許多人認爲他是希特勒未來的繼承人。在國社黨中他雖是主要人物之一，但他平時只特別關心軍事。德國目前擁有一個强有力的空軍，可以說是他個人的功勞。對於國社黨新興的各種理論却不怎樣引起他的興趣。在國社黨中他是一個反猶太色彩最淡的人物。</p>
<p>戈林將軍的性格有時雖使人家害怕，但有時又覺得可親。年來在德國民間廣佈的政治笑話何止千百，而大部分却關於戈林將軍。據一位時與戈林將軍來往的某記者口述，戈林將軍有一决吿訴他說，曾命令自己的副官每天採集這種笑話向他報吿。笑話的題材，大半長戈林將軍的軍裝並勳章。一個例：</p>
<p>「希特勒有一天的好戈林將軍去看戲，希特勒到時預定的時間已過，可是尙看不到戈林將軍的踪跡。台上的劇中男主角看到領袖降臨，連忙不及更換衣服由後臺走到包廂去向領袖致禮。當他走進包廂時，希特勒誤認爲是戈林將軍，希特勒說「又是一套新軍服，黑耳曼，（戈林將軍小名）你可別鬧笑話」！</p>
<p>黑耳曼道個名字在德國民間十分通俗，德國人常說，「我們的黑耳曼」，而不稱「戈林將軍」。聽說，戈林將軍是國社黨中最有度量忍受政治笑話的人物，當他去年結婚時，德國新聞記者聯合會會長曾通吿各會員，每人須寫一篇關於戈林將軍的笑話直接寄給他，向他道賀，雖後來並沒有一個德記者敢於嘗試。</p>
<p>十一·宣傳的藝術</p>
<p>「據說，德國宣傳部部長哥白爾司博士，曾派人向慕索列尼請敎宣傳的藝術，要用會麼方法，才能够使人民相信。慕索列尼說：「道是十分容易的事情，就是開始的第一句話要對人民說眞話，以後你隨便撒多少謊，人家都會相信的。譬如意大利遠征軍在阿比西尼亞一决陣亡了三百人，那末，我們就吿訴人民，本軍某日陣亡了二百五十人，或者索性照實報吿，因爲是事實，這一句話人民一定會相信的。接着我們要怎樣宣傳都可以。」可是哥白爾司博士仍覺得麻煩，連第一句話都捨不得說眞話！」</p>
<p>聰明的讀者自然會看出，道也是德國政治笑話的一種。</p>
<p>單說國新黨此日的成功，我們當然要佩服哥白爾司博士的宣傳天才：又何况他在第三帝國的地位僅决於戈林將軍。不過哥白爾司博士雖掌握了德國的總宣傳機關，但以個人的成就來論，似乎還不及軍人式的戈林將軍。最少他沒有做到人民會稱呼他「我們的若瑟夫」（博士小名。）據說，他曾設法將「我們的博士」這個名詞在德國民間通俗化，然而結果也失敗。爲的大家對他都有點「敬面述之」的熊度。他生平最大的敵人就是外國的駐德記者，因爲這批記者時常要說破他的穴傳藝術。</p>
<p>反過來，戈林將軍却是一個道地的宣傳家。他知道德國人民愛好軍裝，愛好動章，他就將自己變成政治笑話的中心讓人民去傳說，笑話愈多，戈林將軍在民間就愈通俗，只有關於他的笑話半公開地在德國咖啡店，酒館中可以聽到。當他結婚的時候，一個柏林報販在街頭上連聲四喊：「我們的黑耳曼終於結婚了，爲什麼他應該要比我們舒服？」報販可以用這種話來作廣吿，可見戈林將軍的通俗化。</p>
<p>一位德國人說，對於戈林將軍的「輸出」我們是主張保護關稅政策的，假如別的國家要用他的話。至於哥白爾司博士，我們不但提倡「自由貿易，」甚至於「鼓勵出口。」在這里，似乎可以看出各人宣傳方法的不同。</p>
<p>一位曾任某國外交部情報司司長的熱人，有一次吿訴記者，宣佈政治新聞是多麽困難的一回事。他說：「我們傳出一種消息，最少要在三星期以內不會被人家看出那是一句假話才行。過了三星期再被發覺，那末事實上我們的宣傳就算成功。因爲一般人對於三星期以前的事情是不大注意的，但只這三個星期的時間，在我們局中人看來，已經比三個月還要長久！</p>
<p>宣傳真是一種藝術！</p>
<p>十二·德國國社常的排猶</p>
<p>反對猶太人，載明於德國國社黨綱上。去年紐倫　國社黨大會新佈的法律，不但規定猶太人不准同日耳曼種人結婚，甚至於猶太人家中所僱德國女用人，年紀在四十五歲以下的也要被禁止；就是　個家庭的主婦爲德國種，丈夫是猶太種，仍不得有例外。理由在於保護優良的日耳曼種血統，所以不得不「防徵杜漸。」</p>

<h3 id="c175">特載　祁紅之產銷製（續二十六日報） <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>祁紅爲高級茶類，較普通紅茶，往往倍其價格。品質優良，雖價値昂貴，西人嗜之。允以英國人民，最嗜祁紅。祁紅在國內消費，數量甚微，每年生產，幾全輸出。以往英國佔總輸出額白分之五〇以上，法·德·决之，其他如蘇聯，荷蘭等國更决之。據本局茶葉撿騐出口統計，四年來祁紅輸往各國之情形，列如左表：</p>
<p>祁紅輸出數量，按月不同。每年新茶上市，大抵在五月中旬，而祁紅出口，以六月爲最盛。每年六月出口之祁紅，常在七千公擔之譜，七月以後，卽日漸减少，茲列表如左，以示各月輸出之趨勢。</p>
<p>近四年來祁紅茶每月輸出數量表（單位公擔）</p>
<p>以上三表，有一共同點，讀者須注意者，卽祁紅出口數量，實際恐無如是其多，蓋間有出口洋行，以少量其他紅茶，併入祁紅，美其名稱，惟仍以祁紅之成分爲多，是亦難以其他茶稱之，故特誌之，以釋羣疑。</p>
<p>祁紅爲吾國出口茶之一種，除祁紅外，出口紅茶，尙有湖南湖北所產之湖紅，江西修水等縣之寗紅，浙江永嘉一帶之溫紅，閩省所產之福紅等。祁紅輸出數量，在出口紅茶中之地位如何，頗有硏究之價値。</p>
<p>祁紅在輸出紅茶中之百分率表</p>
<p>自上表觀之，祁紅出口數量，僅及茶總額百分之二〇左右，尚不及其他低級紅苶爲多。至就價値言，祁紅出口價値，向無單獨統計，惟祁紅品優價高，其價値自較昂貴，故佔出口紅茶價値百分率，當較數量百分率爲高，可斷言也。</p>
<p>世界各產茶國紅茶輸出數量，年約八萬萬磅，合三百六十萬公担。祁紅輸出，年約二萬公担，僅及千分之六，藉亦可見祁紅所佔地位之微弱。國人耳振於祁紅之名，而不知祁紅之產銷，誠未足與印錫紅茶等量齊觀，相較之下，不營小巫之見大巫。國人對之，固應知所警惕；然祁紅茶之前途，自亦大有發展之餘地。</p>
<p>（三）祁紅茶市價漲落之原因</p>
<p>祁紅茶產量不多，茶質甚佳，素爲英美等國人士所　飮，故價格甚高。內銷甚少，向以外銷爲主。因之祁紅市價，一方面受世界紅苶供需之影響，他方面更因對外滙價而變遷。於是茶葉價格，上下靡定，尤以祁紅究市價，變化無常，忽高忽底，難以捉摸。所幸去年十一月起，政府改行法幣政策以來，對外滙價，頓形穩定，茶價旣無倐高倐低之危險，茶商亦不至遭受意外之損失。匯價問題，旣已解决，茶價可穩定，但事實則又不然。茶價雖因優劣不同而懸殊，然往往同批茶葉，同一品質，因成交日期之先後及供需情形，不同，大異其價格，尤以祁紅茶變化　大，新茶開盤日之市價，與第二日市價，差達數十元，故經營茶葉，危險性殊大，運銷適時，固可獲利倍蓰，反之，足以傾家蕩產。以是茶價增高，茶號乃林立爭利用苶價低落，苶商　奄息僅存。推原其故，苶價不能穩定，實其主因，考世界苶葉消費，紅苶居多：生產國家，除我國外，有印度，錫蘭，荷領東印度等；後來居上，我國紅苶對外貿易，恰屈居出口國之第四位。旣不能控制供需，更不能左右世界紅茶之市價，於是價格上下，隨世界紅茶供需而變趨。供過於求，則價格下跌；反之，求過於供，則市價上漲。歸納言之，造成祁紅茶價變動之主因有二：一卽國際紅茶供需之變遷，他卽滙價之上落。回溯以往數年之情形，更可瞭然　。</p>
<p>（四）近十餘年來祁紅茶之市價</p>
<p>祁紅茶價，素屬甚高，市價隨品質而異。上等祁紅，每市　價在百元以上，有時且達四百餘元；中等祁紅，價的七八十元，卽次等祁紅，亦須四五十元。不但每年價格，時有上落，卽一年之內，各時不同，要視供需情形及匯價而變遷耳。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c176">湖州的絲綿 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— （顏波光）</p>
<p>時序的巨輪已轉到了嚴寒的季節，大家小戶都在預備趕製寒衣。湖州人家，把絲綿來採作禦寒妙品，是很普遍的，像絲綿襖褲咧；絲綿背心咧，絲綿袍子咧，絲綿被咧……可惜絲綿被，服，必須年年添增，重新翻製，方不失去美觀和效能。</p>
<p>每年橘綠橙黃的時候，就有許多老太太們在自己門口貼了紅條子，專替人們翻製絲綿衣服。每日工資，大約二角至半元，另外供給伙食。蘇州上海等處，老嫗們代翻絲綿長袍一襲，代價要一元二三角，翻來不及湖州的老婦挺硬整齊。所以這種行業，倒是一種專門技能，像現代一般摩登小姐，就是生長在湖州的，翻得好的也是很少。</p>
<p>絲綿服裝穿在身上，又溫暖，又輕鬆，並且可以防禦槍彈，如果絲綿襖褲和絲綿袍子都穿在身上的時候，遇到流彈射來稍遠的，的確只能穿入絲綿內不着肉體的，據說這是子彈旋力的緣故。</p>
<p>綏軍將士，在冰天雪地中，奮勇苦戰。後方慰勞的物品，最好募送絲綿馬甲，避寒力强。但是切忌襖褲，因爲襖褲穿在身上，一經運動，它的熱力是更强了，久之，終會使你不能動彈，這，因爲它含有趨炎附勢的作用之故！</p>
<h3 id="c177">北平的駱駝 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 海珠</p>
<p>是深秋了。一片楓葉像一個紅心似的，開在蒼茫的秋野，北平的秋天！</p>
<p>「……料想不到的，這次竟又是秋天了，三年前的今天，當你胃着寒風出去看駱駝的時候，你是不怕冷的，會老遠的跑到正陽門去，現在北平的駱駝已經長着毛了，多麽有趣呵！」蘭的來信說。</p>
<p>駱駝毛長了，秋風吹來冷意了，在北平，永是這樣的。</p>
<p>自從秋風吹落了樹葉，帶來點冷意了，我便想到了北平的駱駝。北平的駱駝，雖然不美麗，可是它的堅忍，它的誠實，也自有可愛的地方。我初到北平，不喜歡秋天的霜和落葉，不慣聽黃昏時候的軍號聲，以及淸晨霧氣裏火車的鳴咽。却偏偏高興在正陽門下看那有趣的駱駝，這時，那麼一隊的駱駝，走起路來，長長的腿兒，那麽一頓一頓，長長的鵓子，那麼一點一點，高高的駝峯，那麽一晃一晃的，從正陽門下踱過來，那些駝夫，拉着繩兒在前面，不怎樣喧吵，不怎樣着急，陪着駱駝一步一步地在那兒踱。</p>
<p>深秋了，不用說，我對於北平日有着好感，就是駱駝吧，在風沙裏來往的駱駝，三年來我曾寫過不少賞駱駝的文字，向人說過許多愛駱駝的話。</p>
<p>現在秋意一天深似一天了，北平的駱駝毛早已長了罷。因爲北平有着那有趣的駱駝，我開始對着它表示我的戀念。……當着秋天的早晨，踏着沙地，讓微冷的秋風吹上身來，我也是一樣地，耐心地，數着迂緩的駱駝的腳步。</p>
<p>「天這麼冷，還去看駱駝嗎？」蘭時常笑嘻嘻地向我這樣說。我是點點頭就走了，只在太陽西下以後，正陽門前稍稍有點冷意的傍晚，便獨個兒回轉來，……</p>
<p>秋意已經很深了，在北平的駱駝，也許長着極多的毛了，可是我那一天可到北平去啊？</p>
<h3 id="c178">西藏的乞丐 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 秋野</p>
<p>做乞丐而認爲金飯碗，這可說全世界上只有西藏一處了。因爲西藏要做乞丐，假如沒有世代相傳，是不能做的殘廢者則例外。西藏多佛寺，佛爲西藏人所最崇拜者，所以佈施的人也就很多，而乞丐都以佛禮向人求佈施，收入也就不惡，於是做乞丐就被認爲世代相傳的金飯碗，靠此爲生者，在西藏是很多的。</p>
<p>不過有一個習俗，做乞丐的不能駡人，因爲一般人皆認爲被乞丐詈駡爲不鮮，故當乞丐佈施時，如施主向其說已施過，他只好垂頭而去。但是乞丐却都有求乞之術，例如每當求施時，卽向施主盡力恭維，或翹大拇指以表示施主之高貴，如此則一般虛榮心的施主，也就樂得給他們一點錢物了。</p>
<p>西藏的乞丐還分兩種，一種是琴丐，一種是技丐。琴丐是以拉四弦琴向人求施的，並且大都帶了小孩子跳舞助興，不過他那四弦琴拉起來都是悽厲動人的音調，故一般人皆感動而佈施。至於技丐，則大都帶有蛇數頭，於施主面前作種種的蛇戲，也有人帶着其他的獸類，以各種技術玩意，取悅於施主，而得錢物之佈施</p>
<p>西藏乞丐之變成世代相傳的職業，這有兩種原因，一種是由於手技及琴技等等的訓練，而爲他人所難於學習者，其决是因習慣的關係，因爲世代相傳的緣故，而各施主也都認定某某係某某之後，故樂於佈施，若非殘廢而想在西藏做乞丐，那是會終年不見一施主給你錢物的，有這兩個原因，故乞丐之後，就大都承繼先人之職業，因旣是金飯碗又比別事易做那又何樂不爲呢？不過這一般乞丐，都是社會的蛀蟲，不事生產的懶猪啊。</p>

<p>若是爲了他自己有什麼事相求，可是親戚之間，向來很疏淡，不會在這個時候，突然有什麼事要來相求縱然相求，大概也是些銀錢物件移動的家常小事，不會來找自己的，只要找老太太好了。可是他旣來了，又不開口說有什麼事，徘徊躊躇，也四人看不出他是什麼意思。因之國器坐在這屋子裏比坐在圍城裏還要受窘，自己不知道應當說出一句什麽話來，才可以把困難解了。正是爲難着呢，劉媽却送了一封快信進來，要他蓋圖章，他這才有了機會，掩蓋手足無所措的窘相，背轉身看信。友梅笑道：我要迥避嗎？國器笑道：呵！沒有什麼，不過是上海書局催稿子的信罷了。友梅靜靜的坐在一邊，等他把信看完了。因笑道：表哥旣是在上海有許多地方要你做文章，你何不到上海去住？國器道：我想，我還要用功看一點書，上海不是看書的地方。友梅道：表哥，上海寫快信來催稿子，一定等着要了。是要筆記？是要小說呢？國器道：筆記也要，小說也要。友梅道：來了信就寫，表哥不覺得村呌缺乏嗎；器道：小說是山我去幻想出來的，倒沒有什麽。筆記要有事實在筆下搬運，有時到也感到困難的。友梅道：我家裏許多太天國時代的信件，據人說，若是整理起來，也是好筆記。表哥需要道種村料嗎？國器道：那是現在最時髦的文字了，那有不需要之理。友梅笑道。旣然如此，我帮表哥一個忙，明天我把這些材料淸理出來，送給表哥，好不好？國器笑道：那太好了。我不敢掠人之美，將來在稿子上我要註明一筆，是李友梅女士供給的材料。友梅笑道：我倒不在乎此……這是未完成的一句話，下面應當解釋着，自己究在乎的那一點。但是他只說了這半句微微一笑，把話就了結了。國器扇着摺扇望了他，他可牽牽衣襟，理理鬢髮，覺得沒有什麽可說明了，只好起身吿辭。他這一來，眞給予了國器一種不可言宣的意味，這是有意呢，還是無意呢？還是有所商量呢？並無什麼商量呢？（一一六）</p>

<p>— 百靈</p>
<p>橘本爲熱帶性之植物，今日則溫帶中亦多種之，性畏寒嚴冬時，園丁以狗糞及河泥壅之－惟用猪糞則死，又易生蛀，壅以硫礦末，則免此患。</p>
<p>橘屬常綠灌木，冬季亦靑葱可愛，故張九齡詩曰：「江南有丹橘，經冬常綠林，豈伊地氣暖，自有歲寒心。」榦高一二丈，莖有小刺，葉作羽狀，葉柄有翼狀小片，夏初開小白花，五瓣，初冬實結，扁圓，色黃或紅，皮薄易剝，味微甘酸，唐陸龜蒙有詩咏之云：「良玉有漿須讓味，明珠無類亦羞圓」，詞句確切。</p>
<p>冬初橘熟，顆圓色赤，與靑枝綠葉，交相輝映，最爲可愛，明錢士升曾咏云：「密密金丸不禁偷，最憐懸着樹梢頭，老人口腹原無分，留得深秋供兩眸。」可謂善於鑑賞者矣。</p>
<p>然橘之功用，不在鑑賞，而在供食，銀盤紅果，風味旣富甜瓤甘汁消化尤良。上者以供佳賓，下者則製橘餅，其滷可製酒類，香料，或果子露，其皮與絡可入藥，無一遺棄。</p>
<p>吾國廣柬，福州，溫州三地皆以產橘名，而余於溫橘知之較詳。羣芳譜載橘出台州，蘇州，西出荊州，南出閩廣撫州，不如溫州爲上。可謂推崇備至。</p>
<p>溫橘產地之變遷，則勞大與甌江逸志有云：「永嘉之土，宜樹橘，韓守彥直之譜足證，宋世產於西山，葉正則詩「有林皆橘樹「是也，厥後盛於陶山之河田，而上岡，而南仙洋，漸至於吳田，地氣之遷徙，昔西北而今東南矣」</p>
<p>溫橘之種類頗多，韓彥直橘錄云：「產於溫州，其種十四，曰黃橘，塌橘，包橘，緜橘，沙橘，荔枝橘，軟條芽橘，油橘，綠橘，金橘，乳橘，自然橘，早黃橘，凍橘。」又據通志云：「東嘉之橘，與浙西之橘相似，其味甘美以無核者爲上，廣輿記所云乳橘卽此也。」</p>
<p>韓彥直宋人，知溫州，作橘錄三卷，上卷柑品人，橙品一，中卷橘品十八，下卷爲種植之法。余於橘錄未之見，故知而不詳，惟得之於友人云：「橘之上乘者有三：一溫州爲蜜橘，爲品種最優者，形大微扁，外皮爲深紅，黃色，皮與熟分離頗易，其瓤囊數的十個左右，香甜味美，成熟在十月杪，貯藏耐久。二爲紅蜜橘，果形圓扁，臍部僅存痕跡，周圍微凹，蒂部凸起，果皮滑澤，作黃赤色。三爲包橘，果實少，扁圓形，蒂部隆起，果窪部稍低平，外皮呈黃色，瓤囊約六個至十個。爲蘇省洞庭產，故又名洞庭紅。一</p>
<p>昔葉適有橘枝詞云：「蜜橘房中金作皮，人家短日掛疏籲，判霜剪露裝船去，不唱楊枝唱橘枝」。於此可知溫州橘業之盛，凡客來溫州者，亦必先嘗蜜橘爲快也。</p>
<h3 id="c183">廣東的蛇 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 南宮生</p>
<p>蛇是一種有毒的動物，雖也有沒有毒的，但是有毒的較多，如火赤練，秤心蛇，灰禿蛇等，都是毒質很烈的毒蛇，無毒的只有青小蛇等等幾種而已。大概有毒的咜，蛇頭是三角形的，無毒的蛇，蛇頭是扁圓形的。</p>
<p>在熱帶地方，毒蛇最多，又有很奇怪的毒蛇，如印度，出產的兩頭蛇，人面蛇，其毒無比。幾年之前，上海大世界內，曾經陳列過這兩種怪蛇，據蛇主印度人講，印度一年之中，死在這兩種蛇毒質上的印人，將三十萬人，這是何等可驚的數目啊！</p>
<p>蛇最大的，四做蟒，長的有二三十丈，粗如圓桶，在菲洲，安南等地方，出產很多。土人對於蟒蛇，認爲美味的食品，捕得後煮熟，作爲敬客的很是不少，這因了蛇的毒質，都在頭部，只須將頭棄去，便沒有毒質了，是一種最鮮美的食品。</p>
<p>我國廣東省，是以蛇爲美肴的地方。近年以來，漸漸通行到了上海，上海的廣東館內，一到冬令，都以吃蛇爲號召，去吃的人，除了兩廣人外，喜歡的人已是不少，所以吃蛇的風氣，已漸漸的普遍了。據善於吃蛇的廣東人表示，蛇肉非但鮮美，又有去風，去寒，活血，强身，治皮膚病的功效，因此每到冬令，非吃不可，每年被吃掉的蛇，其數便可觀了。</p>
<p>廣東人的吃蛇，很是考究。他我們所吃的蛇，共有兩種，一種是大蛇，因蛇身上有金錢一般的花斑，稱爲金錢豹，大的有七八十斤，我們常在廣東館的門口，見到「今天凖宰金錢豹」的字牌，便是吃蛇。一種是小蛇，必須三種蛇合煮，稱爲三蛇會，功效却不如金錢豹的鉅大</p>
<p>蛇肉有三種名稱，同鷄合煮的四「龍鳳會」，同菓子狸合演的四「龍虎會」，再有一種，便是凈蛇肉的「三蛇會」。</p>
<p>蛇的骨頭殺毒，所以殺蛇之後，出骨務盡，不然，便貽毒於吃蛇的人。以前兩廣交涉員朱兆莘君之死，據說便是吃到了蛇骨。蛇膽，又是視爲珍貴的東西，因有明目和去風濕的功效，最好的是「硃砂膽」，帶硃砂包的。通常的吃蛇膽，是飲蛇膽酒，用不攙水的原粱，滴人膽汁而飲。一杯原粱，滴膽汁一滴，酒便成了碧色，飲了有益於人體。但是取膽甚難，稍一不愼，便碎掉了，這都在殺蛇人的手段如何，在廣州，著名殺蛇的廚司，一到冬令，便出足風頭，因有錢的人家，都得吃蛇，都得請他去殺，每月所得的代價，常在幾百元左右，廣東人的吃蛇，也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>在廣州，還有一種專吃蛇膽的風氣，聚了七八個人，到城外專買蛇膽的蛇行之中，大吃蛇膽，這是一種小蛇，蛇膽很小，每人須吃五六個，七八個人，便須三四十條蛇的性命，而且要最活最靈的蛇，取蛇膽的人，練就的手法，可以知道蛇膽的所在，用手在活蛇中挖出整個的膽來，這未免是太殘忍了吧！</p>

<h3 id="c184">求藥與求醫 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 范守淵</p>
<p>中國人對於處理疾病這一件事，有一種最不好的習氣，就是有了毛病，只肯求藥而不願求醫。這種，求藥不求醫的行爲，不知妨害了多少病人的病體，損失了多少人的生命啊！</p>
<p>他們的心裏，以爲生了毛病去請敎醫生，目的也不過請敎醫生來開個把方子，配點藥品吃吃就是了；要是有簡便的法子，能够設法跳過求敎醫生這一關，而直接求到藥品時，可不是一樣的達到目的嗎？吃藥的目的，同樣的能够達到，却省了兩項多餘的手續：旣可省却醫生診察的時間，又可省下了請敎醫生時的一筆診金醫費；這不是兩得的情嗎事？</p>
<p>有了這種怕麻煩省手續，貪便宜走近路的心理，於是一旦發生了毛病，便總不肯好好地去請敎醫生，却自己去找藥品亂吃。於是頭痛呢，吃「阿斯匹靈」，頭痛藥，肚痛吃嗎啡幾丁，肚痛散，推之，腦弱則服補腦汁，血虧則吃補血劑。那裏曉得頭痛只不過是一種疾病的徵象，並非就是疾病的本身；發生頭痛，是有種種複雜的原因，斷非阿斯匹靈的一種藥品所能解决一切的頭痛的。固然有由阿斯匹靈吃好的頭痛，但亦有由於阿斯匹靈吃壞的頭痛哩。肚痛，也只不過是許多的一種共同症狀耳，嗎啡幾丁，固然能止得住一時的肚痛，但未必能治愈發生肚痛的一切疾病呀！又如腦弱，這是病人自訴的自覺腦弱，是否是眞的腦弱呢？當然還是疑問。血虧，亦屬病人自己的想象，是否卽是血虧，也是不能斷定。進言，腦弱是由什麽原因，血虧，又是由於何種原因？不先明白腦弱血虧的根本原因，就來胡亂吃藥，這是如何卽能藥到病除的發生效果呢？可是瞭腦弱血虧以及頭痛肚痛的原因所在，又非得經醫生診察，由醫生査騐不爲功。</p>
<p>病人求醫的企求，雖似只是服藥，服藥的目的呢，當然在求愈病。但要曉得，不先求醫診病；就不能明瞭毛病的根源底細，不明瞭病的底細，而胡亂服藥，那便不但沒有愈病的把握，往往反會弄出意外，鬧出亂子，危及生命哩！</p>
<p>愈病固然是醫生的責任，識病更屬是醫生的技能；服藥固爲愈病一種工具，但有時除了服藥的這一項工具而外，尙有許許多多的愈病方法。若遇到此等不需乎服藥來愈病的疾病時，也糊亂服藥品，那豈非未獲其益，反蒙其害了嗎？是否採用藥品來愈病，抑採用其他方法來治病，亦惟有由識病的醫生來决定，始能免除掉這種意外的危害！始能獲得藥到病除的效果！</p>
<h3 id="c185">廿六年醫藥衛生事業之展望 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 郭子良</p>
<p>廿六年的元旦，眼見得僅差數天就要吿臨了！可喜我們大眾的健康南針「醫藥專刊」就在這萬衆感戴與期待聲中，又得添上了一週年的光榮歷史，但是我們却不能就此認爲滿意，認爲目的至此而止，因爲一年一年的過去，我們所負起的重寄，也就一年一年的增加，並不會一年一年的逐漸减少啊！同時，社會人士對於本刋的企望，如從各個人們口吻中去探討，便可知道他們對於本刋貢獻的增加企望，尤其期待甚殷呢。同樣情形的其他醫藥設施，衛生建設，當然每過一個年頭，總是照舊的增加相當的效力，相當的成績，這種情形年復一年，不過反覆此種不易的方式過程而已，舊事重叙，本沒有什麼希罕的，然而爲什麽獨在今年來說呢？因爲近一二年尤其是今年，衛生事業發展的迅速，衛生防地的開闢與擴張，殊出人意料的獲得重大效果，卽以擺在面前的事實而言，如全國衛生敎育年會籌備成功，南昌麻瘋病院，中正醫學院……都於本年度內先後已有成立或正在進行着的，還有其他建樹正多着呢，故今年醫藥衛生事業的骨幹，遂愈形鞏固，同時醫藥衛生事業將由雛形一變而爲成形的時代了。</p>
<p>當此二六年未來的前夕，正是新舊事業互相交替的一刹間，也就是醫藥界二年工作伊始的時候，所以我們怎能不去檢討我們過去的錯誤，並擬定今後進行的方針呢！而且基礎是否堅固，卽本業成敗的預測，事業的成敗，與國家之利害，自然是連帶着有很重大的關係，故二六年的醫藥衛生事業，在上述情形中，便佔有成敗惟此一舉的利害趨勢，今余以至誠敬祝全體醫藥界人員，應以十二分的努力澈底改革我們的業務，掃蕩我們前途的一切障礙，負起偉大的使命，以維繫我們整個國家的生命，充實國家民族的實力，同時更希望如下述的；</p>
<p>（一）統一系統整飭內部：健全內部組織並聯合各單位衛生機關，使能在同一主理機關之下，以協作共同的目標，去進行已定方針，我國的情形，就是缺乏以上的事實，甚或主理衛生行政事務的人員，頗有不合格的人員濫充其間，而行使超過能力的職務，因此往往有事倍功半見諸事實，有時職權的分劃不能淸楚的分開，上級機關指令，不能按時實行，甚至明張暗弛，這都是內部組織不健全的現象，故而會影饗到整個事業的進展，至於各個衛生機關，如國辦的，省立的，縣立的，私創的，他們互相間存着極度界限的觀念，更因權限的不及。無整個連繫系統，各自了却自己的職任，取互相觀望的態度，致使衛生事業的進步，受到莫大的障礙，故全國衛生機關，應打破以上的觀念，以互相帮助，研究，倡行，聽命任何高級衛生機關指示爲職責，同時政府對各衛生機關，尤其是現在國家處於風雲險惡的時代，應設法統制，力避散漫的觀念與組織才對。</p>
<p>（二）組織航空救護：當現代世界情勢瞬息萬變，東亞危機迫於屬睫的時候，我們實不容再事觀望了，救護事業是戰時的一大重要工作，但是人力的救護，費時旣久費力又巨，往往還不能得着救護的目的，例如前方發生激戰，常有延至數月的可能，而在這數月下的傷者，他的數量，非前方所設的臨時醫院，或少數原有的病院，所可容納，倘轉送前方，而交通在戰時定會衛生擠塞的現象，或較僻的地方，述運輸的工具都沒有，在那種情形之下，而戰錢獲傷者，生命險危，豈容一再展轉，而且就是前方醫院可容，輕傷者尙可獲救，但重傷者處於戰塲之中，恐亦難獲醫士悉心竭力的救治，我們設身的想一想，處於那時期的傷者，固然難救者很多，然而尙可救治者，亦復難以生全，所以現在救護欲達到迅速，和實際效用的目的，就不得不利用飛機的力量，在這航空救國的呼號聲中，我們全國醫藥界，應竭力提倡捐資購辦救護飛機的工作，在政府方面亦應注重戰時傷者的生命，於可能範圍內速加設備，並組織航空救護人員的訓練，或藉前方輸送機空返的機會，敷設若干傷者的地位，載轉較遠的後方，將來能可實現若干隊救護工作機，不僅效力宏大，而且被救護得以恢復生命的傷者，恐將數十倍於前方若干醫院，若干救護人員之工作矣！</p>
<p>（三）矯正醫藥衛生事業畸形發展：如果用眼力把全國考察一下，便可得到以下的結論；在各大都市中，各大名城中的醫藥衛生事業，如醫院診所，衛生所，防疫所等，簡直完備得，發達得，使任何人都有得到健康與治療的享受，並且還有逐漸的增加機會，倘若除此以外，再把目光轉移到其他的地方看看，就不然了，在比較發達的省境內許多冷落的縣分，還可見到零星的診所，與一二不完備及宗敎化的醫院，或許多無正當技術的醫士，寄居其間，持爲營業，遇有求治者，乃認爲奇貨可居，索價若干若干，於是窮苦者永不敢問津了，結果，這類情形，眞是不堪枚舉了，其他邊省荒僻縣境，簡直連影子都沒有，更無所謂什麽衛生事業了，或者也有例外，但那却是百不得一的罷！至於附屬都市的鄕村，才會受到的優遇，例如鎮江爲江蘇省的省會，而鎭江縣轄的鄕村，亦因此受到意外的幸運，差不多全鄉村七區的地方，到有上了三四個省辦的衛生實騐區，縣辦的每區皆有區衛生所，還有什麼衛生站，產院，醫院，診所等等，且衛生實騐處包含的機關，規模都很大，這種畸形發展，雖由於都市人口稠密所需要，然而我們也得應當注意到都市名城以外的地方，使全國各地，不論荒村僻縣，都能够得到非營業的新醫藥普及的洗禮，並且使醫藥衛生事業，同時平均在各地發展的實現。</p>
<p>（四）矯正護士心理及限制不合格人員寄生新醫藥界：護士道德，向爲世界任何國家的醫藥界所注重，其關係重大，似不待言，然而我國一般病院所得印象，却有令人不滿的地方，這也不能說，在訓練方面未能週到，但這完全爲心理作用罷了，試看在每個病院裏面，頭二等病房中，所見的護士們，對待病者，都是非常的禮貌，就是在病人病上及其他一切的工作，也非常認眞，那麽再在普通病室，或平民醫院所見的，那簡直不對了，他們扳着面孔現出厭惡病者的神氣，甚至病者有所詢問，則由麻煩而加以叱斥，像這類事實，或過於此者，很多很多，所以病者方面受到的影饗是很大，以及醫界信譽，也得蒙相當的損失，大槪人們由幼稚的時代，就保存着喜富厭貧的心理，而這心理又頗不易改變，所以到了社會服務的時候，隨時隨地的就發生牠的作用了，我認爲這情形發現在醫界，尤爲可恥，若要改革這不良的發現，必須根本救治，就是要在初步護士訓練約期中，設法加以心理的矯正，至於不合格的人員寄生於醫藥界的，比比皆是，尤其是那種萬惡的江湖術士，他們完全依賴三寸舌，尋攬顧主，說得天花亂墜，行使欺騙金錢行爲，倘使施病者以手術，那就更加危險了，再談到不合格人員的混跡，也很討厭，因爲他們是時常會發生許多意外的錯誤，因而新醫界的信譽時常會無形中，受到他們意外的打擊，所以我們今後不但取消江湖術士，並且限制不合格而直接影響我們名譽的醫藥人員。</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>（五）謀擴充醫藥衛生事業經費之來源：要得擴充醫藥衛生事業，必須有偉大經濟力量，然而我國祇有一定的經濟限量，故欲擴充醫藥衛生事業，便不得不謀共他的方法，並且我且國對新醫藥衛生事業的認識，也很簡單，至於私人捐資興辦醫藥事業的，亦復有限，所以現在政府方面亦應於民衆敎育中，加以相當的感化，使全國人民對醫藥衛生事業，知其重要，知其不能缺乏，而同時各地衛生當局，也得設法宜傳曉以大義，使人民以無益消耗之金錢，如迷信之消耗烟酒之消耗等，自動捐輸，並指定地方某某銀行，或機關商店，常年代收捐欵俾人民隨時得可捐助，果能如斯，則每年每地的捐資，定有很好的成績，若以此擴展衛生醫藥事業，而所得的代價，誠不可估計矣。</p>

<p>— 醫學博士五島博述　李守眞譯</p>
<p>轉瞬臘月，又屆寒冬。每年此際，感冒輒隨之而流行，有愛兒之家庭，尤其是際茲歲末多忙，快樂新年卽至之時，對於萬病之源之邪風，實不能須叟忽略之也。爰請諸五島先生，（三輪延壽堂病院副院長）以小兒科醫者之立塲，指示一切，藉作家庭間之參玫焉。</p>
<p>以後的天氣一天天地寒冷起來了，呼吸器病之隨着增加起來，允其是近來流行着的感冒。這是由大人傳染給小孩子，由一個人傳染給全家，像這樣的家族傳染的時候最多，幸而認眞沈重的很少。罹病之後，最初，熱度大約是在三十九度左右，因爲有咳嗽，很多是晚上不能安睡的。這樣的到了劇烈的時候，便成了加答兒性肺炎：熱度遂由一週而繼續到兩週。屬於流行性的塲合，不消說，絕對的防止是很困難的，可是很輕微的，在家庭間需要加以注意，那是很重要的。這樣說，平時很壯健的小孩子，一旦也沾染了，當然是從速就醫，然而以爲小孩子是壯健的，對之不加注意，這是萬萬不行的。有着咳嗽的時侯，也隨隨便便地讓小孩子來來去去的上學，臨到病加重了而手足無措，這樣的事，是屢見不鮮的。所以就是有了輕微的感冒象徵，作算是非常强壯的孩子，也得注意到，三兩天內不要讓他出外才好，洗澡等等，最好也是暫不舉行爲佳。先前有點喉痛，熱度也繼續有了一個星期，晚上也不能睡覺，像這樣的情形是常有的。這樣，一方面會發生腎臟炎也是有可能的。最强壯的小孩子，冷啊，冷啊這樣嚷着的時候，面目已經腫了起來，很明顯的腎臟炎，兩兄弟都患上了也曾有過，因不注意而至病入膏肓的也是屢見不鮮。這麽看起來，雖然是軟弱的小孩子，假如常常加以注意，就是沾染了毛病，也會很輕微就痊好了的。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c187">關於熱帶病三個字名詞上的商討（下） <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 小卒</p>
<p>一個是所謂熱帶病的認識的必要，因爲其中有不少病症在我們寒濕二帶立國的國家，也有他們的踪跡。一個是應當分門別類擇要編入各科敎科書內，理由是，一則名正正順：一則易於使醫學生在修業期中，獲得關於此類病症底智識的普遍灌輸，平心而論，在所謂熱帶病學中，也有許多爲純粹熱帶產物，或地方性病症，在我們領域內不易得見，無必知的必要。照着上面的第二觀點做去，可以使醫學生得到時間及觀念上的經濟，似乎合着所謂一舉而二得者也。從名熱帶病，而在修業期中，另立名目，勢將使醫學生們存着一種牛疏的歧視，反而失却原來重視的本意。質諸高明，不識以爲或亦一得之愚吾，綜合上面的所說，可以簡略的說。</p>
<p>（一）所謂熱帶病是歐美就地理立塲所定的名詞。</p>
<p>（二）所謂熱帶病中有大部也在溫帶寒帶存在。</p>
<p>（三）熱帶病中主要的病症是肇端於細菌及寄生性生物的地方性或流行性傳染病，其臨床領域以內科爲最廣皮膚花柳外科次之。</p>
<p>（四）熱帶病中病症，有泰半是我們的風土病，我們有認識的必要。</p>
<p>（五）舊時敎科書中大都沒有上項病症的列入，衛生署跟敎育部鑒於這門科目認識的必要，曾决議以熱帶病一門列入醫科後期必修的一種科目。</p>
<p>（六）個人觀察以爲就我們的地理立塲論，就事實上需要論，我們不妨取精捨渣，擇其中在我們國內常見的病症，分門別類，編入各科敎科書中，毌需另立名目，這樣使醫學生在原定的程序內，無形中獲得必需的智識跟和其他並重的觀念。</p>
<p>我們當然也希望有着一天，我們的醫學生，有專修熱帶病學必要的動機。現在衛生署已經在舉辦熱帶病講習班，還不過是爲着各地散在的地方性的傳染病的研究與防止罷了！本人年少學淺，上面所說，還不過憑着個人的見聞而來，其中不免或有舛誤，與不實之處，况且事關敎育，國家設官，自有專職，不需小子嘵舌，不過觀感所及，不欲過事緘默，爰貢其一得之愚，以備爲賢明當局愽訪週諮時的材料。狂夫之言，聖人或探，在下也不過存着這樣一種念頭而已！（完）</p>

<p>（一一三）咽頭疾病的一般症候</p>
<p>咽頭疾病的一般症候。主要的有四。就是（一）咽頭痛及嚥下痛，（二）言語障碍，（三）呼吸障碍，及（四）異樣感覺。在無論那一種咽頭疾病中。這四種顯著症候是常可發生的。茲特分述如左</p>
<p>（一）咽頭痛及嚥下痛－在咽頭急性炎症（如扁桃腺炎，扁桃腺周圍炎，及實扶的里等），慢性浸潤，及潰瘍，（如結核性潰瘍及癌腫）等時。常爲必發的症候。疼痛非但在食物嚥下的時候。就是在唾液嚥下的時候。亦感疼痛。所以患者的面容。多呈苦惱的表情。頭部常傾斜於患側。疼痛有時放散於患側的耳部。或於後頭部，顳顬部，及乳嘴突起部等處。威有疼痛</p>
<p>（二）言語障碍－在咽頭後壁，側壁，及口峽部粘膜腫脹膨隨的時候。咽頭腔的形態。遂起變化。筋肉的收縮亦來不全。聲音陷於變調。口蓋音的發聲。發生困難。或竟不能。這種聲音，稱爲壅塞音，或狹塞音。一般見於扁桃腺炎，扁桃腺周圍炎，及咽後膿瘍等時。」在口蓋穿孔，破裂或口蓋帆的浸潤麻痺等發出聲音的時候。口腔與鼻咽腔間的閉鎖。常來不全。此時呼出的空氣。大都竄入鼻腔。由這種情形所生的聲音。特稱之爲開放性鼻聲。又若口蓋帆愈着於咽頭後壁。或咽頭腔發生腫瘍。則鼻咽腔的大部分或全部分。遂被閉塞。由這種情形所生的聲音。特稱之爲閉塞性鼻聲</p>
<p>（三）呼吸障碍－多因膿瘍，腫瘍，浸潤，及異物等原因。以致鼻咽腔閉鎖。而惹起鼻腔呼吸的障碍。鼻腔呼吸旣被障碍。勢必專營口腔呼吸。屢發鼾聲，睡眠障碍及及其他症狀。</p>
<p>（四）異樣感覺－咽頭疾病中，爲患者所常主訴的一個症候。就是異樣感覺。感覺中最多的，當推瘙癢感，灼熱感，乾燥感，及異物感等等。由異樣感覺的刺戟。屢可引起咳嗽的發作</p>
<p>（一一四）咽頭炎</p>
<p>咽頭炎本有急性與慢性的兩種。不過由病例上的證明。則槪以慢性者爲多。所以現在單就慢性者。略爲一說。</p>
<p>慢性咽頭炎的原因。最顯著的。當爲持續的口腔呼吸。其他如氣候的變化（譬如空氣乾燥，及氣溫急速的變動等），塵埃，有毒氣體與蒸氣的吸入，酒精飲料，及烟草的濫用等等。亦多爲本症的原因。此外並有遺傳的關係。更若鼻與副鼻腔疾患，慢性扁挑腺炎，體質異常（貧血及萎黃病等），及上氣道的慢性鬱血（多血，便秘，及心，腎，肺疾患等）亦常爲本症的原因。</p>
<p>慢性咽頭炎的病型。由病理解剖的不同及炎症的限局部位。可以各自分爲三類。如左。</p>
<p>一、由病理解剖的不同而分類：</p>
<p>（一）慢性肥厚性咽頭炎</p>
<p>（二）顆粒性咽頭炎</p>
<p>（三）萎縮性咽頭炎</p>
<p>二、由炎症的限局部位而分類：</p>
<p>（一）廣汎性咽頭炎</p>
<p>（二）鼻咽腔加答兒</p>
<p>（三）咽頭側索炎</p>
<p>關於以上各類的說明。恕不詳述。</p>
<p>慢性咽頭炎的自覺症候。當以分泌異常及知覺過敏爲最多。每朝常由咳嗽作用咯出多量的粘液。此外則有頸部緊張感，咽頭異物感，瘙癢感，乾燥感，嚥下時的耳部疼痛（咽頭側索炎），聲音與言語的障碍，及疲勞等等症狀。</p>
<p>慢性咽頭炎的治療。就是嚴禁烟酒的刺戟。注意氣候的變化。治療鼻與副鼻腔痰患，慢性扁桃腺炎，體質異常，及上氣道的慢性鬱血。至於局部的處置。則須由醫師主持施行。</p>

<p>公共衛生學之目的，就反面言之，爲除去民衆健康之損害，就正面言之，則爲增進民衆體魄之健全，至若考其實施技術，必多方借重藥學，其與藥學之關係，至爲密切，若空氣，土壤，衣被用具之衛生試騐，水，牛奶，一切飲食物，毒品之檢査，藥品及麻醉品之鑑定，消毒及預防用藥品之製造，國藥之提煉，以至軍用毒氣之研究等，皆在减少或除去危害民衆健康之原因也，他若食物營養之研究，戰時食品之支配，又皆爲謀民衆健康之改善，及體力之增加，進而增進民族力也，凡此所舉，無一不屬於藥學範圍，然則藥學在公共醫生學中所佔之位置，寗待煩言！我國藥學，向極落後幼稚，較其他科學爲尤甚，已往因未得國人之體認，當爲進步遲緩之主因，謂爲國內公共衛生發展之缺陷與障礙，實非過言，故欲求公共衛生之進步，同時須注意藥學之提倡，兼籌並進，庶乎有豸，吾人於邵先生此次考察之際，甚望對此向爲一般人所忽視之衛生界缺陷，而與公共衛生關聯密切之藥學事業，如藥學敎育，衛生試騐技術，製藥工業藥品及麻醉品管制，營養研究諸項之設施槪况，特予留意，歸來貢獻政府，作調整之努力，謀齊驅之進展，直接爲藥學前途慶，又豈非整個衛生事業進展之福音也耶！</p>

<h3 id="c190">現代吉珂德先生的悲哀 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 汶</p>
<p>吉珂德先生帶著他唯一的助手桑科判紥出外去游俠，他對那助手道：夥計，你勇敢的跟着我啊！待我去與那島上的巨人作戰，把那巨人打倒了，我就封你在那島上爲王。桑科判紮聽着非常的高興，懵懵懂懂的，欣然的騎下一匹瘦驢子跟着他走了。</p>
<p>這故事，我們拿來和今日的德國希特勒元首對他統治下的人民的諾言相比，倒也不相上下。希特勒元首對他統治下的民衆是如此說的：不要因爲目前沒東西可吃而懊惱，世界有的是殖民地呀，我們去搶啊！尤其－這時他把兩只說利的眼光向歐洲的東方一射過去－在那邊的黑海邊沿的烏克蘭，眞是一個吃着不盡的寳庫。我們得以全力去奪得來。那時，我們便可游泳於一片富庶的海洋之中了。德國人民初聽着：不錯的，我們是需要殖民地！於是，餓着肚皮把所有金錢去製造毒氣砲坦克車罷。這與桑科判紮聽信了吉珂德先生將封他在島上爲王的諾言，竟是一般無二的。</p>
<p>可是，偉大的諾言，雖頗動聽，但也只能興奮於一時，到看到要達到在那島上爲王的目的還非常之遼遠時，過去因一時興奮而忘却了餓的肚子，這時會加倍的餓得難過了。吉珂德先生是不會讓你餓着起慌的，他有事情可做。走到半路，當面遇到了一座巨大的風車了。他於是以萬分緊張的神情，激勵着那助手道：游俠的機會到了，前面那東西便是我要打倒的可惡的巨人啊。一馬上前，逕和風車戰爭了。希特勒眼中的風車是什麽呢？呌作：布爾希維克！這是他一再高聲提醒着他背後跟着的一羣桑科判紥以至於世界的一羣桑科判紥的。</p>
<p>希特勒這第一次出馬，可眞走到了吉珂德先生的故鄉來了。在西班牙，他放出了多少砲彈，飛機，坦克車一切的精銳武器。只是大不幸的，吉珂德先生所遇到的風車，雖並非如他口中所形容，眞是一個怎樣可怕的巨人，但却頗有些力道。這使可憐的吉珂德先生的第一次出馬，竟不能不遭到了悲慘的失敗。矛也折了，頭盔也破了，倒露出了一付稜稜的瘦臉。讓跟着他的桑科判紮忍着一肚子寃苦爲他裏傷。現代的吉珂德先生呢？據英國的某記者說！希特勒要末傾全國之力再加緊援助西國叛軍，否則，只有自承失敗了。古今游俠之士，倒不料竟會走上了如前相同的命運！眞可哀哉！</p>
<p>讓我們且慢聽信着吉珂德先生口中所說巨人的怎樣可怕，且先看看他面上戴的東西（頭盔），是鐵製的，還是紙製的？經得經不起眞理的揮拳一擊？</p>

<p>— 鄒衡</p>
<p>從蒼老的正陽門向南面駛出市外去，往電車七坐一刻鎬，到那座殘破的石橋處，車傳了。人們走下來，這就是晴天很熟鬧的天橋，沒有到過故都的人，也如道那裏是上京來的鄉下伙子：和城市裏出賣勞力的人們閑玩的地方。打這兒再往南走百十步，在一個烏綠色的濠坑邊，有一排矮矮的黑色泥坯房，在夏天，這口池塘的水面。滿浮着一些粘膩膩的綠水藻，水是靜止的，常醱起着一個個的泡沫，飄出股悶人的惡臭味。岸邊經常丟着雙死狗死貓的屍體，現在是隆冬，天空上像掛了一匹大瀑布，翻捲着繽紛的雪粉，把池塘上青黑色的冰塊蓋上了厚厚的一層，岸上是條曲折的人行小路，這里也給雪鋪上了匹自茸茸的氈子。</p>
<p>泥坯房的每家門口，都斜插了枝竹杆，杆頭下，用鐵絲掛着　柳條笤籬，再下面，有一條半尺長退了顏色的紅布，泥塑的門框邊，有的貼著「悅來店」之類的紅紙條子，也有什麼不貼的。</p>
<p>夜間十一點左右，打城廂裏各個角落跑出來的呌化子，偷雞摸鴨，或抽着玉石咀烟袋的偷兒，跟一些白面鬼，便一個個佝僂着腰，凍得荷荷地打着戰，兔子似的那般敏捷，沿着街道一排排閉起來的木板門，在雪地中匆匆忙忙的奔跑，便接連地溜　這一座座小黑門裏，客人揭開那稻草門　，抱着雙胳膊邁進去，店主人就把那向着小火爐的臉仰起來，問一句：</p>
<p>「坑上呵？地下？</p>
<p>客人呢，一面湊到爐火跟前烤着火，一面掏錢，要把五個大銅板放到爐台上，那坑洞中燒着熊熊木柴的大坑上，便可讓你滾熱的酣睡一夜，要只能拿出三個銅板，那就不舒服了，店老闆照例的問一聲：</p>
<p>「燒呵？還是誧？」</p>
<p>客人嗯一聲燒的時侯，老闆就打屋角里捏起一小捆　楷，在坑洞口燃着，把一點點灰燼和殘火攤開在土地上，待那麼吸　烟的工夫，用掃帚把板掃了，這個化了三個銅板的漢子，便趁地皮熱熱的這當口，」，倒身睡下，疲乏了一整天的身子，再不問後半夜的寒冷了。也有客人跟店老闆說：</p>
<p>「長櫃的給我鋪上層」。</p>
<p>這就是說不睡那燒熱了的地皮，老　便給在地上撒兩大把雞和鴨的絨毛，雖是那麼薄薄的一層，可是睡下時不那麼冰冷冷的，對這些給衣食給嗜好壓扁的人們，已經很幸幅了。北國的酷寒，常使一些少衣無褲的窮鬼、凍得倒在胡同口不能動轉，每碰上雪從狂風的夜晚，街角處常發現一兩具眺牙瞪呵可怕的死屍，這羣被幸福遺棄的人，手裏能有幾個銅板時，决不甘心受那裂膚的寒風欺凌，一定要到那慍煖的雞毛店裏去唾</p>
<p>店主人十九是一些下等「混混兒」，穿件灰色或黑色的老布袍子，前襟上常塗着一片發光的油泥，歪罩在耳朵邊的，是一項瓜皮軟帽，左手提一枝長杆竹烟袋，右手袖筒裏藏一把錫小酒壺，白天，蹲在店門口曬曬太陽，喝口酒，神氣顯得介外悠閑，附近一帶的居民，要朱落了雞鴨，豬子，或被　時，就常常託這類店闆打聽打聽，有時化點錢能找回原物來，間或也有一兩個貪圖便宜取買破　的人，到這裏暗暗買些　贓再去販賣。</p>
<p>過了冬天，這些小店有幾家此關了，店主人都是些遊手好閑的傢伙，也小會去作什麼正經勾當，沒準也跟了那般「草上飛」的徒弟，也挖牆搗洞的作那沒本錢的生意去了。</p>
<h3 id="c192">路邊草（註） <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 柳岩</p>
<p>洛塘河上的冰塊解了冰，碧清的水波現在又潺潺底流動了。在荒郊，野草的綠苗，也突破了地面，·一叢叢的蓬勃起來，從泥濘，的道旁一直蔓延到平原和山巔。……</p>
<p>春天了。——</p>
<p>正是某一年初春的季節。天下着　霏細雨，沿栽們故鄉的山崗上，樟林寡，有淺永流響的河沼中，都給　霞關一邊飛來的流彈日夜掃襲着。戰雲一天天的加濃了，前方的兵士們支不住而一批批潰敗下來，當他門經禍每個村坊的時侯，便是拉夫，砍人，撈路邊草……遍搗着子民們的窠穴，我們的村子，也沒有悻免。頓時，村人們狼狽地嚎啕地向周野沒命的奔逃……</p>
<p>我呢，爲着太年輕，在爹爹給人拉走的時侯拋留下來了。——</p>
<p>留下來我一顆驚慌的童心，只是慄慄戰抖着，伏在屋角里靜聽着郊野慌亂的腳聲：有時，我放胆地從門縫裏透出眼綫來，窺望著來往不绝的行人，——兵，村民，和塗了滿臉炭灰的年青的姑娘。</p>
<p>直到第二天的晚近，我的家，終於給二個兵破門而入了。他們向我恫嚇，臉子獰佈得使我害怕。然而在這間破頹的小屋裏，能有什麼東西，去抑平他們的慾焰呢？……</p>
<p>我只是亂搖着頭，兩腿問老想打軟，想說的話－時也衝不出喉矓，最後是「哇！」的哭起家了！</p>
<p>「哭，小狗子！」一個惆晦氣色臉的把肩上洋搶解下來向我一揚，眼睛突得像頭瘋狗，接着急促地說：「你講，你講，……花邊藏在那見？……好好的講」</p>
<p>「兵爺爺！饒……命！「我急呌起來</p>
<p>這時，另－個矮截子的兵士，卻搶過來抓了我的臂肘，我覺得疼痛，身子幾乎掉在地上，耳邊卻又是一阵高罵：</p>
<p>「小子！講！花邊呢？不講老了就這麼一槍搗死你」。</p>
<p>「我……我不知道！……请爺們去找。我爹是跟隨你們一槐去了啊，」！我勉強鎮靜越來，吃吃答答地从齒縫裏拼出了幾句回話。</p>
<p>接着，他們放鬆了我，餓虎似地撲到草堆邊，用槍軋在那里亂戮，亂抽。五分鐘過去，屋子裏遍攤着破布，草筐，瓶子：連幾把碎了的雨傘，一包經年無人注意的沒效的田契……統統七另八亂地堆在地上，任他們的跳跡蹂踏着</p>
<p>「老鄉！走吧。……奶奶的，這人家沒有油永」。矮截子的現在從這堆髒物上跳出來，身子滿是灰泥，看樣子，他有些不耐煩了！</p>
<p>可是另一個呢，繼續在滿屋梭巡着，一面翻到那鐵鍋的底下，叮叮的幾聲嚮，那一包爹爹生平用苦力積儲下來的六七槐龍洋，卻白亮亮地捲進了他的腰包。隨即他回過臉來，向我投了一個滿足的笑容。</p>
<p>——完了——什麼都完了——一個黑影幌在我的面前。我頭眩，眼花，幾乎又哭出來了。</p>
<p>半夜里——</p>
<p>第三批從前綫潰敗下來的兵，又踴進了我們的村坊，原野裏一片利害的暄嚷，和誰着人們的哭聲，鋼鐵的鏗鏘聲……</p>
<p>這夜，千百畝地　的白　村，又展開了歷史上空前未有的大亂·…………</p>
<p>春深了。——我們的村坊，仍舊朦在死寂的空氣裏，所留下來的只有廣場上一片傾倒的野草，和一所所人盡財空的草屋……</p>

<p>— 羅之華</p>
<p>當我搬進一家理髮館底樓上的第一天下午，屋裏的東西都已收拾就緒，在洗操間裏洗了手出來，跟我同住的桐就說：</p>
<p>「你看這　夥—」</p>
<p>他底手向三樓樓梯口指着。</p>
<p>在那兒，站着一個孩子，年紀不過五六歲的樣子，一看去，或知道他底教育楚不完全的．臉蒼白，鼻涕黑乎乎的在上曆跟兩腮上滿佈着，好像下雨天在地上栽了個跟頭似的。衣服上也是泥污。最奇怪的是他底手跟腳，沒在目的地，好像四周都是蒼蠅或牛蜢，亂舞着，驅逐着。臉上現出掙扎的表情。一對大眼睛射出憤怒的火，牙齒死命地咬着什麼東西。</p>
<p>「怎麼回事兒呢？「我望着桐，」小孩子…」</p>
<p>他沒有回答我。</p>
<p>我就特別注意起這孩子來。</p>
<p>後來知道；他是二房東底孩子，一個男孩子，另外還有一個十六七歲的女孩子，是他底姐姐。他底爸爸就是理發店的主人，母親每天　談天或者打麻將。姐姐呢，平常在家裏，有時到工廠裏去作臨時工，不過很少遇到機會。</p>
<p>這孩子是白痴。雖然看去祗有五六歲，事實上，已經有十一歲了。</p>
<p>「他怎麼會成了這樣子呢？」我問他姐姐；</p>
<p>她正在洗衣服。兩條結實的胳膊，筋肉一張一弛地跳動着，從窗間射進來的陽光，在上而　了二層光彩，當她用</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>力地在搓板上揉衣服時，就跟兩條打了臘的棍子在動似的。她一回洗衣服，一面看顧坐在一隻低矮的籐椅上亂舞着手脚的弟弟，也許是習慣了吧，好像並不在意有一個小孩子在她旁邊。</p>
<p>當她聽到我底問話的時候，她停止了洗衣，吿訴我，他是因爲吃藥吃壞了，才弄得這樣的。</p>
<p>「那時」，她說：「他才三歲害病了，什麼病大家都說不定，醫生祗管給他藥吃，也沒斷定是什麼病，結果，就是追樣，每天，吵鬧，不能說話，不會走路，－吃飯倒比我差不多少！」</p>
<p>那孩子還跟第一次見他時一樣，不自主的動作，也一樣。好像一個幾個月的小孩子，反覆地表演着自已底本領。</p>
<p>「他不會說話，可能聽話嗎？」</p>
<p>「可以的，不過祗能聽幾個人底話，別人底話，懂不懂不知道，他總不理會，－我跟爸妈底話他是聽的。」</p>
<p>我聽她講完，就出來了。她待一會兒，跑到擱樓上去拿東西，在她回去的時候，大聲地喊起來，好像碰見驚人的事情。</p>
<p>我跑上去。她正把那孩子從浴缸裏抱出來：混身是水，一身棉衣都浸透了，頭髮上也掛滿水珠。水太凉了吧，眼睛發呆，嘴唇和臉蛋兒都變紫了，還發着痙攣。</p>
<p>她一面抱他出來一面用拳頭往他身上捶。孩子却祗「能，　　！」地發呌。一句最簡單的話也說不出來。</p>
<p>事後知道：他在她走出去以後，跳到酒缸裏洗操去了。他自己是不知道脫衣服的。在夏天，常常這個樣兒。</p>
<p>他就這樣平淡痛苦地過活着，往成年的路上走，當父母的，也很平淡，痛苦地陪着過日子。雖然，在談起來的時候，常常嘆氣。在嘆聲裏，我明白，那是含滿了無限的老年的悲哀的。在他們眼裏看起來，這孩子是沒用的，女孩子也沒用，作母親的又常常害病，會不會再生一個孩子是難以解答的，而生下來的是男是女，更不能說定。</p>
<p>每天　着那孩子，他呆呆地發痴的眼睛也不能回答這痛苦的題目；祗是舞着手脚，聽他母親跟別人談天或打麻將</p>
<p>「要是他是一個女孩子呢？」我跟桐都這樣疑問着。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Premier Chiang of the Executive Yuan has already returned to Nanjing. Acting Premier Kong Xiangxi issued a telegram on the 28th, announcing his resignation from the acting premiership effective immediately. The original telegram is recorded below for the information of the provincial and municipal governments, and pacification commissioners: "The Xi'an Incident shocked both China and the world. The Central Government, recognizing that the central administration could not be suspended even for a day, resolved that Xiangxi should take responsibility for the Executive Yuan. I immediately took up my duties despite illness. At this critical juncture, I recognized my limited abilities and deeply feared failure. Fortunately, with the support of my colleagues in the Executive Yuan, the military and civilian leaders of the provinces and municipalities, adhering to the established policies of the Central Government and Premier Chiang, working together, and with the support of the people nationwide, the trust in the government, and unified efforts from top to bottom, we were able to stabilize the financial situation, secure the territory, maintain domestic order, and garner the sympathy of friendly nations. Now that Premier Chiang has returned to Nanjing, I am fortunate to continue serving under his leadership and exert my utmost efforts. Therefore, my acting premiership duties should be relinquished immediately. In addition to requesting Premier Chiang to continue executing his duties and reporting to the Central National Government for review, I hereby send this telegram for your information. Kong Xiangxi."

<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Pilian received a telegram from Yan Xishan on the 27th, stating that the bandit-puppet troops in Shangdu were concentrating again in large numbers, and that thirty aircraft and twenty tanks had also been sent to Shangdu for use, seemingly preparing to invade again.

There are widespread rumors in Shangdu that a certain important staff officer from outside the pass will fly in within days to convey the resolutions and strategies.

Wang is indeed colluding with a certain party's advisors in the Dushikou area, contacting Gu Ruzhen, and planning to go to the puppet government in eastern Hebei. Suiyuan East has been peaceful recently. The reinforcements from the puppet army have not yet arrived, and it is mostly propaganda. A certain party is currently building large-scale military camps in Dolun, and it is rumored that they will deploy heavy troops before advancing towards northern Chahar. In the future, the bandit army will not dare to carry out small-scale harassment again. When the large army of a certain party is fully mobilized, Suiyuan East will probably not be troubled for the time being. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>

Present were Yu Youren, Zhang Ji, Deng Jiayan, Jing Hengyi, Li Wenfan, Wang Boqun, Wang Zhengting, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Xunyong, Chen Qisong, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and over 500 officials from the National Government and various Yuan, ministries, and commissions. Chairman Lin led the ceremony, followed by a report by President Yu on "The Condolence Visit to the Northwest and Impressions." The ceremony adjourned at 10:30 AM. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Jingheng's full speech at the Central Government Memorial Week on the 28th was roughly as follows: "The Xi'an Incident was a truly significant disaster. These people, slipping and sliding, became so dizzy that they confused their ability to discern, their trust, and their own responsibilities. First, how did they confuse their ability to discern? Chairman Chiang showed us over one hundred thousand words of his diary and documents. Only after others saw them did they understand. Furthermore, they said that if they had known even four-tenths of it beforehand, they would not have caused this great disaster. Should they not blame themselves for not using their ability to discern? As long as one can judge appearances, see the subtle beginnings, and is willing to use their ability to discern, mutual understanding and comfort can support this difficult situation. Therefore, one must never allow their ability to discern to be confused. Second, how did they confuse their trust? Because they used their ability to discern less, they reduced their trust in others. Our trust in the leader and the government relies on seeing a little and understanding ten times more. Even a common store relies on the shareholders' ability to discern when employing a manager. 'Doubt people not use, use people not doubt.' Focused trust will surely lead to success. Therefore, I am willing to use my ability to discern and my trust, and I will not be confused. Third, how did they allow their own responsibilities to slip into confusion? Once a leader is trusted and held responsible, his orders must be followed, and one cannot delay their own responsibilities. For example, if the country is not strong, one cannot entirely blame the government, but half the blame should go to the people for not exerting greater effort. Not to mention airplanes and cannons, just consider smuggling. If we could all set up factories to manufacture our own products, they would be somewhat embarrassed. If others do not require tariffs and ask us to import, what goods do we have to compete with? As long as the people fulfill their own responsibilities in this regard and increase the strength of the government, this will be a solid people's front line, not just a verbal call for people's war. It is gratifying that the entire country warmly welcomed the leader's escape from danger, which shows everyone's enhanced ability to discern, increased trust, and redoubled efforts to fulfill their respective responsibilities." (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Yu reported on "The Condolence Visit to the Northwest and Impressions" at the National Government Memorial Week on the morning of the 28th. He first stated that the Xi'an Incident was entirely due to the Zhang Yang troops not understanding the Central Government's intentions and being incited by malicious elements. The Central Government believed that this kind of disturbance, which endangered the leader and harmed the nation, necessitated sending him to the Northwest to offer condolences to the military and civilians, so that they could understand the Central Government's intentions and quickly correct their rebellious actions. Next, he stated that for several years, the Central Government had tasked the Zhang Yang troops with suppressing bandits, but they fell prey to the cunning schemes of the remaining bandits, who not only failed to suppress them but also allowed them to operate within their ranks, using various words to蛊惑or sow discord, causing them to doubt and betray the Central Government. Furthermore, after the Third International changed its strategy, it proposed the so-called "People's Front" slogan. For them, this was just a strategy of using various people's organizations and associations as their working periphery, attempting to implement the Communist Party's agenda and overthrow the Kuomintang. They outwardly said that the Kuomintang was also part of the People's Front and should unite with all sectors of the people to save the country together. But this strategy, at least, gathered all the vacillating, rebellious, and dissatisfied elements of the Kuomintang together. The greater goal was to gradually shift the power of the party, and the smaller goal was to divide the party's strength. Little did they know that the party itself was a broad and powerful People's Front centered on the Three Principles of the People. Since the Shanghai incident, it was known that they had been very active in the Xi'an area, saying that Chairman Chiang not only did not resist the enemy but also signed many secret agreements, such as anti-communist agreements, etc. Therefore, they speculated that there must be various secret documents between Chairman Chiang and the central generals, which were unfavorable to Zhang Yang. They listened to this discord without examination and committed this absurd act. Later, when they searched Chairman Chiang's diary and all the confidential documents, they realized that there was no discrimination against the Zhang Yang troops at all, and that they were cared for and treated without prejudice. They also discovered various important national defense plans. At this time, they realized that they had been deceived and committed a mistake of rebellion, and they suppressed their violent energy and stopped their rebellious plans. This was an important turning point in the Xi'an Incident. From this, it can be said that Chairman Chiang's many years of secret devotion to saving the country was discovered by Zhang Yang, and it can also be said that Chairman Chiang's spirit of public and loyal service to the country was discovered by Zhang Yang. Next, he said that we saw Chairman Chiang's published speeches and his instructions to Zhang Yang in Xi'an, and we knew that the resolution of this incident was due to the influence of Chairman Chiang's sincere personality. During a time of extreme danger, he brilliantly maintained this sincere, firm, and upright spirit and spoke to stubborn and rebellious traitors. This great and unyielding spirit made anyone feel awe-inspiring and inviolable. His great personality should not only be admired by our comrades but also respected by people all over the country and the world. How should we emulate him? He also reported on the condolence visit in detail and said that after entering the pass, he could only convey the Central Government's intentions and the government's consistent goodwill towards them, as well as the situation in which they were incited by corrupt elements and deceived, so that they could fully understand, and so that they and the general people of the Northwest would know that this action had actually allowed the remaining bandits to linger and hindered the anti-Japanese work. This little bit of expression made him feel that he had failed his mission, etc. Finally, he said that now that Chairman Chiang has safely returned to the capital, his responsibility to the country will be even greater, and because the people of the whole country and the people of the world respect and love him, they must use his consistent cultivation and determination over the past decades to greatly comfort him. He hopes that everyone who loves Chairman Chiang will help Chairman Chiang so that he can work harder to serve the country, comfort the hearts of the people of the whole country, and satisfy the admiration of people all over the world.

<p>(Nanjing) According to those returning from Xi'an, the military and political leaders who remained in Shaanxi due to the Xi'an Incident were all residing in the guesthouse. Member Shao Yuanchong was staying on the lower floor of the guesthouse, with a window facing the street that could be crossed by people. In the middle of the night, Shao heard gunfire everywhere, and the guesthouse was filled with noisy voices, suspecting that mutinous soldiers had broken into the guesthouse to rob. He tried to escape through the window to seek temporary refuge on the street, but as soon as he crossed the window, he was shot down by random gunfire in the drainage ditch under the window. At that time, he lost too much blood and could not be saved, so he died a martyr. His remains have now been escorted by Liu Fu, the chief secretary of the Ministry of Interior, dispatched by Minister Jiang Zuo Bin, and transported to Nanjing via the Longhai Railway.

<p>(London) Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, recently went to Geneva to attend the League of Nations Executive Council meeting and met with Wang Jingwei, who is currently on his way back to China, in the Riviera region. He has now returned to London and had a frank discussion with a Reuters reporter who visited him about the resolution of the Xi'an Incident. Guo said, "The most important fact in this incident is that the whole country was able to maintain calmness in the most critical time, which is no different from the calmness shown by the British people during the constitutional crisis. Another thing worthy of special attention is that during the Xi'an Incident, the expressions of loyalty to Nanjing from all directions were not directed to any individual, but to the central government, which is sufficient to show that China's gradual unity and the progress that has been established will not be disrupted by civil war, and there is no phenomenon more significant than this." Guo also mentioned Wang Jingwei, saying that his overall health has improved, and his heart is quite healthy, but the nodules in his gallbladder have not fully healed. According to Guo's opinion, after Wang returns to China, he may not assume the position of cabinet minister, because Wang is currently the chairman of the Central Political Committee and can still exercise his power as a veteran. Guo also said, "When China was becoming stronger, Wang had no choice but to adopt a policy of non-resistance towards Japan, and only a few people may know the personal emotions he sacrificed. The fact that the government is now able to adopt a tougher and more popular policy is all due to Wang's perseverance."

<h3 id="e27">After the Signing of the German-Japanese Pact <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Lieshan</p>
<p>The Germans are Familiar with Japan</p>
<p>The sensational "German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact" has been signed for two weeks now. In these short two weeks, the Japanese have undoubtedly been considered the happiest race in the world. Because from the moment the treaty was announced, a portion of Germans suddenly discovered a new race, a new ambition, and a country as worthy of human respect as Germany. The joy of the Germans, especially the joy of the Japanese, is everywhere filled with pleasant air. If you meet a young member of the National Socialist Party, even if he knows you are Chinese, this kind of joy cannot be restrained from showing itself. He will tell you the significance of this pact in world history, and at the same time, he will especially remind you of how excellent the Japanese race is. Finally, he concludes that within a few years, the world's leading countries will be subject to "natural" elimination. His eyes glowed as if predicting that "a new era has been born!" This frank statement is considered a sign of German honesty! However, you are Chinese, you know the relationship between China and Japan, you know that the German business community values ​​China's friendship, and you also know that even if Germany and Japan really form a military alliance, Germany will not have much military power to send to the Far East to help Japan deal with China. You tell him all this, you remind him not to repeat the mistakes of the European war. He thinks for a moment and says; maybe the Japanese will use Germany, but who knows if Germany is not using Japan? Well, the Chinese nation, China's friendship is naturally worthless in his eyes. This is the international political concept of the youth of the "Third Reich". We admire the courage of the Germans, but we still cannot find the need for Germany to offend China. Currently, China is a unified country. The dream of treating China as a colony, even the British "die-hards" have changed their views, let alone other European countries! German-Chinese trade has surged in the past year, and we believe that Germany is not short of wise men who will consider their own economic interests.</p>
<p>In fact, only some people in Germany welcome this pact, at least not all Germans. Everyone has not forgotten the lessons learned during the European war. Although the efforts of this group to propagandize are already astonishing. It is said that the pro-Japanese sentiment in Berlin's social circles is more Japanese than the Japanese themselves. They spread this concept to the people: first, Japan is anti-Russian and anti-communist, with the same fate as Germany. Secondly, the Japanese are also an excellent race in the world. But most importantly, the general German believes that in the event of a war between Germany and Russia, they can get the strength of Japan to help. So in the winter of 1936, the Japanese suddenly became the "comrades" of the Germans, or even more. Japan fever is a social phenomenon this year. Even when girls encounter yellow-faced foreigners on the road, they no longer say "Japanese devils" (Jabst). They will say in a sympathetic tone, in a sympathetic tone peculiar to girls: "Ah! That's a Japanese!"</p>
<p>Because the current pro-Japanese phenomenon is top-down, the German political party authorities have been particularly busy for the past two weeks. For example, German leader Adolf Hitler, in addition to hosting a banquet for Japanese Embassy personnel in Germany to celebrate the success of the pact, also specially issued a congratulatory telegram for the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Academy in Berlin. Another example is Mr. Ribbentrop, the German Ambassador to the United Kingdom. He traveled back and forth between London and Berlin, and I don’t know how much effort he spent just to sign this pact. His honorable appearance can be seen everywhere in news films recently. In addition, he also issued a statement proving the value of this pact. Another example is Mr. Rosenberg, the Minister of the Foreign Political Department of the National Socialist Party. He is currently a key figure in charge of German foreign policy. The Japanese Domei News Agency even spared no expense to conduct a "visit record" with him on wireless telephone from distant Tokyo. Of course, the busiest person is Dr. Goebbels, the Minister of Propaganda of Germany. He not only plans the overall propaganda affairs, but also wants to give public speeches to the people. In particular, under his guidance, German newspapers have a consistent line to promote German-Japanese friendship.</p>
<p>The Japanese are an excellent race, and Mr. Hitler also has this view. After the closing of the World Games, he told a reporter that when he - Mr. Hitler, saw the posture of the Japanese marathon winner running, he could not help but think of this admirable Japanese race. However, Mr. Hitler's example is a bit inappropriate. He did not find out the relationship between the winner and the Japanese race beforehand, so he got the premise wrong. Because the winner is not the "excellent" Japanese, but precisely the Korean who is oppressed by the "excellent" kind.</p>
<p>The Germans say that the Japanese are an excellent race. What do the Japanese say in this atmosphere? Taking advantage of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Academy, a Japanese professor gave a speech on "The Origin of the Japanese". He does not admit that the Japanese are a mixed race of Mongolians, Malays, Koreans, etc. The reason, according to the research of modern Japanese linguists, is that Japanese is an independent writing. A kind of writing cannot be found in other countries in the world. Therefore, the Japanese are a special race, which is the conclusion of this professor.</p>
<p>It is said that the arguments in the newspapers represent public opinion, which is the so-called public opinion. Therefore, if we want to observe the phenomenon of German-Japanese friendship, we naturally have to look for materials in the German newspapers, especially the National Socialist Party newspapers. Summarizing the arguments of this group of newspapers, we can get a formula, that is: Japan is a country with an "ancient" culture, Japan is a military power, Japan is a vanguard against communism and Russia, the Japanese are as excellent as the Germans... and so on. Some people are also worried about this group of reporters, fearing that such praising materials will be finished soon. However, people who are familiar with the situation of the German press cannot help but sympathize with this group of reporters, naturally not only because of the relationship of "colleagues".</p>
<p>In fact, what does it have to do with us Chinese if people are anti-communist, anti-Russian, and pro-Japanese! If people do not hinder the interests of China, we have no reason to be jealous. But is this actually the case! According to the statement made by the German Ambassador to the Chinese government, the German-Japanese Pact will definitely not hinder the interests of China and the friendship between China and Germany. Naturally, this is not only our hope, but we can even understand the sincerity of the German government. However, judging from the arguments in the German newspapers about the recent Sino-Japanese events and the posted telegrams, there is at least no way to eliminate our doubts.</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, almost all of the Far East telegrams published by German newspapers have been exclusively handled by the semi-official German News Agency. Nine-tenths of the sources of the telegrams came from Tokyo, and only one-tenth came from the agency's resident reporters in China. The content of the telegrams from Tokyo is almost the same as that of the Japanese Domei News Agency. Not only does it quote Japan's position on factual matters, but also the wording is the same. For example, when describing the recent negotiations between the Japanese Ambassador to China and Foreign Minister Zhang, the agency calls the Japanese Ambassador "Ambassador" and calls Foreign Minister Zhang simply "Zhang". The status of a Minister of Foreign Affairs is not as good as that of an ambassador. The politeness of the agency's resident reporters seems to be not normal. What is especially puzzling is that the agency's telegrams often intentionally or unintentionally plead for Japan, as if Japan's actions were the result of China's coercion. We once sympathized with Germany after the European War when it was oppressed by others. Unexpectedly, on this day, it is not willing to give a fair criticism to our current struggles, a nation's struggle for survival! The big reason is that the Chinese government does not yet have a kind of news policy, so people can not bother to consider these things, naturally! What is even more bizarre about these telegrams is the arguments of the newspapers. For example, the "National Observer", the organ of the National Socialist Party, recently published an article quoting Sir Lytton's report to the League of Nations in 1932, saying that the Chinese Communist Party is very powerful and has a population of about 90 million. The implication seems to be that China will always be red too early, and the only way to save the Far East is to let Japan rule China. This reporter has been stationed in China for many years and is very clear about the current situation in China and the power of the Communist Party. Why ignore conscience, obliterate facts and agree with the Japanese? Is it because of the German-Japanese alliance that it is necessary to fabricate some rumors for China? Opposing Soviet Russia and opposing the Communist Party is none of our business. But when China is insulted, the Chinese people cannot sit idly by.</p>
<p>Another National Socialist Party newspaper even said in an editorial that we Chinese should not oppose Japan. The reason is that Soviet Russia occupied China's Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang, and China did not speak; Japan occupied the three northeastern provinces and Jehol, and China resisted desperately. It seems that China is not fair to Japan and Russia. This kind of argument that interferes in other countries' internal affairs may be pleasing to the Japanese. But at the same time, they must also remember that this is precisely an insult to China.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been many rumors that Germany will follow Italy in recognizing the puppet state of Manchuria, the question is only whether Japan can come up with appropriate exchange conditions. This is not only an opportunity for the German government to prove the friendship between China and Germany, but also in our Chinese eyes, it is very important to us, at least it will make us clear where we are standing!

<h3 id="e39">1937 Annual Review of Japanese Finance (4) <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Nan Ling</p>
<p>If what the Minister of Finance says isn't mere official rhetoric, then it's overly optimistic. Looking at the current international situation, defense spending can only expand year by year. Not only military expenditures for the army and navy, but also industrial promotion fees and national livelihood stabilization fees, which are considered broad defense expenditures, will inevitably continue to increase. If there are no tax increases or new bond issuances, where will these inevitably expanding expenses be sourced?</p>
<p>Currently, Japan, in all aspects, is moving towards greater control. Many Japanese people, in conversation, even mockingly refer to it as the "era of control." The result of this control will be the decline of some industries and the sudden flourishing of others. Achieving genuine economic prosperity for society will be difficult. Even if prosperity is achieved, leading to natural revenue increases, the resulting tax increases and rising prices will inevitably lead to increased expenditures. Therefore, the optimistic tone of the financial authorities is, in reality, simply because they have already placed unprecedented pressure on the masses and cannot help but promise them a beautiful future. What is the actual state of Japanese finance? It is one where the burden on the masses will not be alleviated year after year.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry's 1937 trade outlook: It is believed that Japan's trade in 1937 will be better than in 1936. With the establishment of a massive budget as its foundation, the military supply industry will surely flourish. Rice and silkworm cocoons, the two mainstays of rural areas, will also see increased sales as a result. At the same time, general small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises will also prosper due to the activity of the military supply industry. Therefore, Japan's finances in 1937 are very optimistic.</p>
<p>Perhaps this can become a reality? But it is only a cosmeticized fact. Moreover, to realize this cosmeticized fact, it is necessary to implement drastic control and strengthening measures.</p>
<p>First, strengthen trade controls. The "Imperial Economic Conference," currently underway, linking Japan, Manchuria, Korea, and North China, is discussing how to prevent the deterioration of trade next year. The so-called "Manchukuo Industrial Five-Year Plan" and "North China Economic Development" are both establishing the foundation for a quasi-wartime economic system. The current world is moving towards the end of capitalism. The lively progression of capitalism is impossible to develop as desired. To make it flourish and adapt to a quasi-wartime tax system, it is essential to implement strengthened trade controls.</p>
<p>Second, strengthen capital controls. After issuing more public bonds, the Ministry of Finance will inevitably adopt a more enhanced policy on exchange rate management to prevent capital flight. On the one hand, strengthen the low-interest rate policy in line with the trade control policy to control financial capital. Use administrative means to shift the public bond digestion method from a natural digestion method to an artificial digestion method to establish the foundation of the public bond national policy.</p>
<p>Third, strengthen industrial controls. Centering on the military supply industry, implement various industrial controls from various perspectives. Impose strict controls on various industrial forms of export and import, as well as raw materials and profits, to create a crippled economy that can adapt to the prosperity of the military supply industry.</p>
<p>Due to the strengthening of these control policies, Japanese finance in 1937 will naturally appear in a new form. This new form is:</p>
<p>One hand presses down on the masses, while the other hand raises the banner of enriching national defense and developing industry. (December 14)</p>

<h3 id="e40">On the Eve of the Expiration of Naval Treaties <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>In two days, the Washington and London Naval Treaties concluded by the five countries of Great Britain, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy will expire. We know that these two treaties were relatively successful arms limitation treaties after the Great War. The former was established in 1922. In addition to limiting the tonnage of battleships of the signatory countries, it also maintained the balance of power between Great Britain, the United States, and Japan in the Pacific. The latter was established in 1930 and limited the tonnage of auxiliary ships of the signatory countries. For more than ten years, the signatory countries have still been actively expanding their armaments and engaging in maritime rivalry, but they have always been constrained by the treaties and have been unable to avoid certain restrictions. Now that these two treaties are about to expire and become ineffective, the naval powers will naturally actively prepare to expand their armaments again without restriction and launch a maritime arms race.</p>
<p>Before the expiration of the naval treaties, the five countries of Great Britain, the United States, France, Japan, and Italy had engaged in tortuous negotiations on ways to limit armaments after the expiration of the naval treaties. However, due to the conflicting interests of the participating countries, only the Anglo-American-French Agreement was produced. This agreement, because it did not include countries such as Japan and Italy, cannot be equated with the Washington and London Naval Treaties in terms of its effect. Moreover, the agreement further stipulated that if countries other than the signatory countries actively expand their armaments beyond the appropriate ratio stipulated by the Washington Naval Treaty, the signatory countries may also lift their treaty obligations and engage in free competition. This provision, at a time when Japan and Italy are about to lift their treaty obligations and actively expand their armaments, is tantamount to opening a convenient door for arms expansion. Secondly, although Great Britain has also concluded naval agreements with Germany and the Soviet Union, stipulating the ratio of the naval power of the two countries to that of Great Britain, the naval power that Great Britain has allowed Germany to retain has not yet been fully accepted by France, and Great Britain has also allowed the Soviet Union to freely build a Far Eastern navy on the condition that Japan does not join the Tripartite Agreement. This kind of infighting diplomacy not only cannot limit the competition for armaments, but also is enough to promote the rate of arms expansion.</p>
<p>Sure enough, after the establishment of the Tripartite Agreement, Great Britain immediately announced the reservation of 40,000 tons of destroyers whose ship age had exceeded the limit. Recently, it has further hindered the construction of five battleships. In addition to actively building ships, the United States is also following in the footsteps of Great Britain, announcing the reservation of 59,000 tons of destroyers whose ship age has exceeded the limit. France is also unwilling to lag behind. Even when its finances are extremely tight, it still does not hesitate to raise huge debts to expand its armaments and implement a shipbuilding plan. Japan announced the abandonment of the naval treaties two years ago and actively accumulated materials, preparing to implement a large-scale shipbuilding plan starting next year, in order to bring its military strength to the same level as Great Britain and the United States. The naval budget for next year has reached 680 million yuan, setting a record. In the past two years, Italy has built two battleships of 35,000 tons and many light ships. There are currently more than 50 various ships under construction. As for Germany and the Soviet Union, they are stepping up the construction of the naval power that the Anglo-German and Anglo-Soviet agreements allow them to retain. Not only that, but the issue of the re-fortification of Great Britain, the United States, and Japan in the Pacific is unfolding, and the rivalry between Great Britain and Italy in the Mediterranean is also becoming more active. The latter issue may be temporarily eased by the conclusion of the Anglo-Italian Mediterranean Gentleman's Agreement, but the former issue is becoming more serious. Not long ago, Great Britain had a proposal to maintain Article 19 of the Washington Naval Treaty, restricting fortification of the Pacific. However, this proposal was not accepted by Japan and the United States. Recently, the United States has built air force bases on Midway Island and Wake Island in the Pacific as a countermeasure against Japan's arms expansion. In this way, it will be much easier for the United States to fight in the Western Pacific in the future. This has also given Japan a major stimulus for arms expansion.</p>
<p>In short, the naval powers' arms expansion competition is becoming more and more obvious. This competition can easily evolve into a maritime arms race. After the expiration of the two major naval treaties, what methods should be used to reduce the dangers of this naval competition? This should be the question that statesmen from all countries who care about world peace are anxious about.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) End of the Japan-Australia Trade War, Exchange of Notes Stipulates Trade Relations, Valid for Eighteen Months</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japan-Australia trade negotiations have been completely resolved with the exchange of official documents between the representatives of the two countries on the 26th. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs specially announced the contents of the announcement on the evening of the 27th as follows. The Australian Minister to Japan, Mr. Garret's note to Consul General Murai,</p>
<p>(1) The Australian government abolishes the import permit system implemented on July 8, 1936, for Japanese goods.</p>
<p>(2) The Australian government applies the intermediate tax rate to Japanese-made cotton cloth and rayon cloth.</p>
<p>(3) The Australian government reduces the intermediate tax rate for cotton cloth and rayon cloth as follows: Cotton cloth per square yard</p>
<p>One and a quarter pence for bleached cotton cloth, one and a half pence</p>
<p>Two pence for printed cotton cloth, four pence for rayon cloth</p>
<p>(4) The Australian government waives the 5% ad valorem tax on Japanese-made cotton cloth and rayon cloth.</p>
<p>(5) From January 1, 1937, to June 31, 1938, the Australian government will allow 76,675,000 square yards of Japanese cotton cloth and rayon cloth. Consul General Murai's note to Minister Garret,</p>

(3) During the period from January 1, 1937, to June 30, 1938, the Japanese government will limit the quantity of Japanese cotton cloth and rayon cloth shipped to Australia as follows: 76,875,000 square yards of cotton cloth and 76,875,000 square yards of rayon cloth. (28th Alliance)</p>
<p>Melbourne, the Australian-Japanese trade war, ended formally today because both parties have completed their new commerce terms. The agreed term of this item is eighteen months, to June 30, 1938 expiry. The Australia and Japan trade war, has been in place since May this year. At that time, the Australian nation had, for imports on Japanese goods such as cotton cloth and rayon, increased commercial tax rates, and implemented a licensing system, Its purpose was to increase commercial preference for England, and to support its own country’s products. Japan was greatly affected as a result, and immediately followed the procedure of dealing with Canada, to reciprocate. As a result, Australian wheat, wool, and flour must be licensed to be imported into Japan, and for a certain number of goods imported into Japan, a tax rate of 50% must be added. Japan also threatened to reduce the number of Australian wool imports by two-thirds, and purchase one-third from other countries, with the remainder using artificial fibers as a substitute.

<h3 id="e42">Britain and France Demand from Germany Not to Aid Spanish Rebels, Stop Sending Volunteers, Mussolini Agrees to Temporarily Stop Sending, Hitler in a Dilemma <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) British Ambassador Sir Phipps and French Ambassador Poncet jointly submitted a note to the German Foreign Ministry yesterday afternoon, protesting the dispatch of volunteer teams to Spain, in accordance with the non-interference in the Spanish Civil War. A semi-official German organization criticized the incident today, saying that Germany had solemnly stated months ago that volunteer teams had become the most important event in non-interference. According to an official spokesman speaking to Reuters reporters, most people in various countries are now willing to participate in the Spanish Civil War, and one side has long begun to assist the Spanish government and raise money to support it. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German News Agency recently announced that the governments of Great Britain and France have submitted a note to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, advising the German government not to send any more volunteers to Spain to assist the National Army in combat, and said that this note is a natural result of the work currently being carried out by the Committee for Adjusting Methods of Non-Interference in the Spanish Civil War and is not surprising. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Well-informed sources here believe that whether or not Leader Hitler wants to take risky military action on the Spanish issue and isolate Germany is still undecided at this moment. However, it would be difficult to believe that Hitler has changed his original intention towards the Spanish National Army government and will no longer provide effective assistance. However, well-informed sources also believe that the Ambassador to England, Ribbentrop, has already met with General Voebel, the chargé d'affaires stationed in Burgos, Spain, to report to the Leader on the attitude taken by Great Britain towards the Spanish situation, and the talks between Great Britain and Italy on the Mediterranean Agreement may also be enough to change the decision taken by Hitler on the Spanish issue. In any case, the note submitted to Germany by the governments of Great Britain and France has not yet been considered by Hitler. The note is being translated by personnel from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and will probably only be reviewed by Hitler today. In addition, Hitler has not convened his close advisers in Berchtesgaden to discuss the matter, so it can be asserted that he has not done so. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Leader Hitler suddenly encountered the difficult problem caused by the Spanish Civil War during the Christmas holidays. General Voebel, the German representative in Burgos, has recently returned to the country and told Hitler that another 60,000 to 70,000 people would be enough to allow the Spanish National Army to win. It is said that Hitler is currently considering whether to supply the Spanish National Army with the needed manpower or to refrain from active intervention in order to curry favor with Great Britain. It has not yet been decided. It is heard that the German General Staff favors maintaining good relations with Great Britain, but the National Socialist Party advocates sending the needed manpower. If the wishes of the National Socialist Party are realized, the Soviet Union may not be willing to remain passive for long, and the French government will also be subject to internal pressure to intervene. However, the German authorities have announced that they have no intention of sending large numbers of troops to Spain and that the rumors that the recent detention of German ships by the Spanish government may cause serious international disputes are ridiculous. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) It was learned from reliable sources today that Great Britain will refuse to provide Germany with financial assistance or land concessions in exchange for Germany's strict neutrality in Spain. It is said that Great Britain believes that accepting Germany's request to restore its lost territories will lead to the same serious crisis caused by the Spanish Civil War. An official told the Associated Press reporter today that if Hitler decides to withdraw from the Spanish Civil War, he must do so on the premise of taking into account European peace. The official is now awaiting Mussolini's response regarding Spanish neutrality, because if Mussolini can accept the Anglo-French proposal and not interfere in Spain, Germany will be isolated and helpless. It was learned today that Mussolini's main contribution to the Anglo-Italian Mediterranean Gentleman's Agreement will be Italy's complete non-interference in Spain. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Rome) It was announced today by responsible parties that Italy has stopped transporting volunteer teams to Spain and is awaiting negotiations. As for the claim that Italian expatriates have withdrawn from the Balearic Islands, it is still difficult to confirm. The origin of this claim is said to be the result of the impending establishment of the Anglo-Italian Mediterranean Gentleman's Agreement. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>

<p>Bayonne The representative of the Basque Autonomous Region government stationed in this city recently made a statement to the press that after the German merchant ship Paros was detained by the government army warships of the country outside the port of Bilbao in northwestern Spain, the authorities have investigated and confirmed that the ship did have the private smuggling of military supplies. There is also a Spanish man and a German woman on board, who live in Melilla, Spanish Morocco, and are now traveling to Seville, Spain, on the ship. Their names have not yet been verified. The shipowner also refused to explain the types of goods loaded on the ship and destroyed all the shipping documents before arriving at the port of Bilbao. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The entire German public is extremely indignant about the case of the German ship Paros being intercepted by Spanish government warships near Bilbao on Saturday. The retaliatory steps will be announced today or tomorrow. At the same time, it is believed that there are currently a number of German warships, although it is not clear what orders they have been given, but it is known that they are sailing to Bilbao. There are between six and nine German warships in Spanish territorial waters, and it is heard that Germany's most powerful "pocket" battleship, the Deutschland, the Admiral Scheer, and the 6,000-ton cruiser Köln have quickly sailed to Spain. According to well-informed sources, if the Spanish government safely returns the Paros to Germany, the case can be concluded. If the ship and the people on board are damaged, a serious situation will inevitably occur. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Hamburg After the German merchant ship Paros was detained yesterday by the government warships of the country in the waters of the port of Bilbao in northern Spain, shipping industry personnel here recently announced that the government has instructed various shipping companies not to allow the loading of any goods that may be considered contraband by the Spanish government.

<p>(Berlin) The rumor that Leader Hitler, who is currently spending Christmas in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria, convened diplomatic, economic, and military authorities to hold a meeting to prepare for a certain sudden action was denied by semi-official sources, who said that the Leader is currently spending the holidays in the town with only a few close friends and that no political or official figures are present.

<h3 id="e45">German General Seekt Dies, Once Served as Military Advisor to Our Country <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) General Hans von Seekt, a famous German general who reorganized the German army after the European War and served as a military advisor to the Chinese government from 1934 to 1935, died today at the age of 67. The victories of the German army during the European War were largely due to Seekt's efforts. When the European War broke out, Seekt served as the chief of staff of General Lottau, commander of the Third Army. In 1914, he participated in the battles of the Western Front. In January 1915, he planned the German army's offensive in Soissons. Later, he served as the chief of staff of General Mackensen and planned the strategy to defeat the enemy forces in Galicia, allowing them to drive deep into Serbia. In 1920, when the Kapp Putsch occurred in Germany, Seekt used his iron fist to suppress it. Later, he completed the reorganization of the Republican National Defense Force. During this campaign, Seekt dealt with difficulties with a calm and decisive spirit. A slight mistake would have been enough to cause a greater revolution. Seekt has since gained international fame. Afterwards, Seekt announced that if anyone, regardless of their political party, attempted to take action again, he would order the troops to open fire. Seekt kept his word, so everyone was in awe of him. However, this angered many conservatives, and Seekt became the target of all the monarchists. In 1926, Seekt was slandered for allowing Prince Wilhelm, the eldest son of the former Crown Prince, to participate in the army maneuvers, and he resigned angrily in October of that year. Seekt was the son of a general and had a solid family education, so he showed his talent as soon as he joined the army and was promoted very quickly, holding important positions. On the day he resigned from his command of the army, he ordered his subordinates to bid farewell and ordered the German army to work diligently at all times, maintain the honor of the German military, until they entered the grave. Seekt's loyalty to the country was praised by both the extreme left and the extreme right, which shows his trust in the whole country. In 1923, when Hitler launched a coup in Munich, President Ebert granted Seekt full authority, and Seekt was able to restore order in a short period of time. Seekt was a resolute and taciturn person. Whether he was a monarchist, a liberal, or a democrat, even his closest friends did not know. However, judging from his words and deeds in peacetime, he seemed to be a monarchist, because Seekt not only respected the former emperor, but also believed that a unified Germany under the Prussian emperor had the best chance of restoring its world status. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) General Hans von Seekt, a famous German general during the European War, died this afternoon at the age of 70. Seekt was born in 1866. He joined the army at the age of 19 and served in the military until 1913, when he served as the chief of staff of the Third Army. After the outbreak of the Great War, he served as the chief of staff of the famous General Mackensen, commanding operations in Serbia, Romania, and Galicia. Later, he was hired by Turkey as the chief of staff of the Turkish army. After the end of the war, he participated in the German delegation to the Treaty of Versailles. In 1920, he organized the German National Defense Force and was appointed as the commander-in-chief. In 1926, he retired after allowing the grandson of the deposed Emperor Wilhelm II to join the National Defense Force, which caused resentment from the republican government at the time. He joined the right-wing People's Party and engaged in political activities. From 1930 to 1932, he served as a member of the House of Representatives. Later, he was hired by the Chinese government as a military advisor for more than a year. During his lifetime, he advocated that the army's organization should be centered on long-term professional soldiers and supplemented by short-term conscripts. This view is still supported by some people in Germany. General Seekt wrote many books, and "The Thoughts of a Soldier" is widely praised at the time. (Havas, 27th)</p>

<p>Madrid – National Army: Today, under the cover of artillery fire, a swarm of troops charged across the Manzanares River, launching a fierce attack on the thinly manned and unprepared defense forces. They succeeded in capturing the North Station. However, the government forces immediately dispatched reinforcements, transporting them by automobile to the Western Front for a counterattack. Eventually, they drove the National Army back to the areas of Carabanchel and Barajas de Jarama. The government forces claimed that this counterattack advanced one mile. The International Brigades have now occupied El Pardo. The government forces on the northern route also hold a slight advantage. The National Army abandoned several tanks while retreating, but the National Army leader denies this claim. (National Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Madrid – Fierce battles erupted today in the suburbs of Madrid, the fiercest since the siege of Madrid began. The National Army crossed the Manzanares River near the Parque de la Casa de Campo in the western suburbs, pressing towards the capital. Meanwhile, the government forces advanced two kilometers near the town of Usera in the southern suburbs, threatening the right flank of the National Army. The details are as follows: On the western front, the National Army launched an offensive near the Parque de la Casa de Campo this morning, immediately crossing the Manzanares River, opening artillery fire, and attacking the positions of the government forces, supported by six tanks. The government forces returned fire with artillery. Subsequently, the militia charged out of their trenches for a counterattack, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the Moroccan indigenous troops and foreign legion soldiers of the National Army until 6:30 PM, eventually driving back the National Army. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Two National Army tanks fell into the river. At the same time, on the southern front, the government forces launched an offensive in the town of Usera. At 7:30 AM, the sound of artillery rumbled as the government forces began their charge. The militia forces surged out of their trenches, divided into two columns, advancing valiantly under the cover of machine guns. By 4:00 PM, they had advanced two kilometers and occupied the town of Basurillas. After consolidating their newly occupied positions, they continued fighting. After the government forces occupied Basurillas, their artillery units could bombard the National Army positions in the Parque de la Casa de Campo in the western suburbs, and threaten the town of Carabanchel. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Madrid – The Nationalist forces shelled the densely populated Latina district of the capital from 3:00 AM until 10:30 AM this morning, the shelling was initially sparse but intensified suddenly at 7:00 AM. The residents of the area immediately sought refuge in cellars. Some women, disregarding the danger, still crowded into shops to buy food, but were eventually dispersed by the militia. According to news received here from the northern port of Bilbao, the Nationalist forces launched a fierce attack on Markina in the Basque region, but were repulsed by the government forces.

The foreign soldiers are actually superior to the untrained militia. The government forces were retreating steadily before the International Brigades joined the fighting. However, Clifford has not seen a single Russian in the government forces. A retired French officer in the Madrid defense headquarters told Clifford that there are currently 5,000 foreign soldiers on the Madrid front, with the Germans being the most skilled in combat. Even when the situation is dire, they do not retreat. The Spanish are willing to fight, but lack discipline. There are currently 10,000 foreigners in Albacete being trained.

<p>(London) The Archbishop of Canterbury, who strongly opposed the proposed private marriage of King Edward VIII, delivered a radio broadcast speech today, predicting that the new king's administration would be more enlightened than the previous one. He said, "The past year will be unforgettable in our nation's history. However, it is best to remain silent about these recent memories. The past is like the dead. We should shift our gaze to the future and view the past as a foundation for rebuilding national life. As for the position of religion in other countries, I do not have time to elaborate. What I want to say is that the vast Russian society is poisoned by aggressive atheism and opposes Christian doctrine with the theory of class struggle. We are very aware of this and should do our best to prevent this poison from confusing our people. Outside of Russia, in other countries, the infiltration of heresy is not as obvious as in Russia, but its harm is even greater. It even borrows the name of religion to worship racial idols and uses the state to usurp Christ's supreme position. Therefore, we need religion more than ever today." Finally, he stated that next year is the year of the new king's coronation, hoping that the people of the whole country will respect the right way, reform the old and innovate, so that the social atmosphere will be changed, and the UK can be blessed by God to achieve a realm of perfect governance.

<p>(London) The Daily Express reports that the British Admiralty will soon build the world's largest battleship, costing £8 million, more than £1 million more than the battleships "King George V" and "Prince of Wales" built after the expiration of the London Naval Treaty. The huge cost is due to the ship's need for fully equipped anti-aircraft guns. This world's largest battleship may soon have two sister ships built. (National Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Washington and London treaties will be completely abolished in three days, and the world will enter the first year of treaty-free naval freedom. Within the year, an understanding has been reached between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan regarding the application of the trapezoidal clause to auxiliary vessels that should be abandoned. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>The United Kingdom retains four Hawkins-class Class A cruisers and modifies five Ceres-class cruisers, and also retains 40,000 tons of destroyers exceeding their age.</p>
<p>The United States, like the United Kingdom, retains 40,000 tons of destroyers and adds 19,000 tons, totaling nearly 60,000 tons of destroyers.</p>
<p>Japan, of course, can retain 28,000 tons for the United Kingdom's 40,000 tons of destroyers.</p>
<p>Since Japan's destroyers have already been abandoned, and there are currently only 11,000 tons of destroyers, it is agreed to retain 15,000 tons of submarines. As for submarines, in accordance with the wishes of the United States, it has expressed a magnanimous attitude and applied the trapezoidal clause. In this way, the ships that the navies of the United Kingdom and the United States want to retain and can use can be retained without being abandoned. Even with submarines, they can stand in an advantageous position. As a result, the ships abandoned at the end of 1936 are generally not abandoned. Also, in the first year of treaty-free navy, the current strength of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan is as follows (excluding those under construction, unit tons):</p>
<p>Battleships</p>
<p>Japan 272,070 9 ships</p>
<p>United States 455,400 15 ships</p>
<p>United Kingdom 474,750 same as above</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The protocol regarding the extension of the validity of the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty was passed by the Privy Council Congress on the morning of the 28th. The government immediately submitted it to the cabinet for decision and requested the Emperor's approval. The Foreign Minister then telegraphed Ambassador Shigemitsu in the afternoon to sign it. As a result, the protocol was decided to be formally signed in Moscow by Ambassador Shigemitsu and Foreign Affairs Director Stomoniakov, in accordance with the contact between Japan and the Soviet Union. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will publish the full text of the protocol as soon as it receives a telegram confirming the completion of the signing. Due to the conclusion of the protocol between Japan and the Soviet Union on the 28th, the basic fisheries relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union can be said to have been satisfactorily adjusted. The Soviet Union voluntarily maintained the stability and extension of the fishing area under the Hirota-Ganin Agreement and the issue of the ruble conversion rate of three jiao and two fen and five li, which had been agreed upon between Japan and the Soviet Union. The Soviet People's Commissariat for the Food Industry instructed the Vladivostok Far East Fisheries Administration. The specific content of this resolution is as follows:</p>
<p>Conversion rate issue: The conversion rate of one ruble to three jiao and two fen and five li will continue to be paid as before for borrowing area fees and other expenses.</p>
<p>Fishing area issues</p>
<p>(1) Among the stable fishing areas under the Hirota-Ganin Agreement, those expiring within this year will continue to be extended for one year. Japan will continue to retain 282 fishing areas as before.</p>
<p>(2) The auctioned fishing areas, only those expiring within this year, will be auctioned on February 28 next year.</p>
<p>(3) New fishing areas will be auctioned on February 28 next year.</p>
<p>(4) The contract period for factory fishing areas (special contract fishing areas) is July of the year after next and will of course be retained by Japan.</p>
<p>(5) Soviet state-owned fishing areas, recognized by the Hirota-Ganin Agreement, will continue to be valid. (Allied News Agency Dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The fifth four-ministry meeting to review and adjust the reform of central institutions was held at the residence of the Minister of Finance on the afternoon of the 28th. The four relevant cabinet members, including Minister of Finance Baba, Minister of Education Hirao, Minister of Communications Raimogi, and Minister of Railways Maeda, attended. Following previous discussions on the draft for the establishment of a new state policy integration agency, the Cabinet General Affairs Agency, a general outline has gradually emerged. The general opinions are as follows: The name of the new agency is the Cabinet General Affairs Agency. The Director-General of General Affairs should be treated the same as a minister appointed by the Emperor. The General Affairs Agency will have three bureaus: the Planning Bureau (reorganizing the current Cabinet Investigation Bureau, Resources Bureau, and Statistics Bureau), the Personnel Bureau, and the Budget Bureau. The Personnel Bureau and the Budget Bureau will not be subordinate to the General Affairs Agency. The Personnel Bureau will be an independent bureau, located in the Cabinet. Also, the Budget Bureau will not be established and will continue to be handled by the current Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. However, the General Affairs Agency will be involved in the budget for implementing state policy. The Legal System Bureau and the Information Committee will remain as before. As for the relationship between the Economic Conference of the Economic Staff Headquarters and the General Affairs Agency, they will remain linked and will not be regarded as the relationship between the Cabinet Review Committee and the Investigation Bureau.

<h3 id="e53">Fire in German Subway, Construction Began Three Years Ago, Still Not Completed, Goering and Goebbels Visit the Scene <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) The underground railway at Potsdamer Platz was started after the Nazi Party came to power and has been under construction for more than three years. Today, a fire suddenly broke out in the railway workshop and spread rapidly. Thick smoke continuously billowed from the ground. Although 19 fire hoses worked together to put out the fire, the fire had not subsided slightly by 10:00 PM. The material losses were huge. The fire brigade excavated trenches in the nearby Leipzig Street so that the power of the fire hoses could directly reach the fire pit. A large number of soldiers and police maintained order in the surrounding area and prevented onlookers from approaching. Minister of Aviation Goering and Minister of Propaganda Goebbels also personally visited the scene after hearing the news. The fire brigade, fearing that the fire underground might cause the collapse of nearby houses, ordered everyone in the hotels and shops to evacuate. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) This morning, a large fire suddenly broke out in the tunnel of the underground railway under construction on Potsdamer Strasse. No fewer than seventeen fire brigades rushed to put out the fire. At that time, the audience blocked the road. Minister of Aviation General Goering and Minister of Propaganda Dr. Goebbels also arrived at the scene. From a car made by Fire Chief Goritz, they used a loudspeaker to direct the fire brigades to fight the fire. It took several hours to succeed. Many underground workshops, as well as electrical wires and partitions, were destroyed. Because there were sleepers and asphalt barrels in the tunnel, the fire spread very quickly, and thick smoke was everywhere. The firefighters could hardly enter the tunnel, so they urgently summoned a large number of excavators to dig up the road. The firefighters were then able to start putting out the fire.

<p>San Diego, California, USA – Former Mexican President Calles made a statement to the Associated Press here today, saying that dictatorial politics can only be maintained by violence and can never succeed in freedom-loving countries. Therefore, dictators in various countries will eventually destroy themselves, because if human rights are threatened, violent reactions will inevitably arise. At that time, only dictators who change themselves into politicians will be able to save the situation. The maintenance of peace must be based on the welfare of all the people, and not on the forced implementation of personal will. Spain has now become a battlefield for communism and fascism, and the root cause lies in the authorities' vain attempt to suppress public opinion by destructive means. Looking at the United States, the principles of progress and social justice have been established, and these principles can only be sought through democracy. Therefore, I say that communism will never succeed in the United States or in Mexico. (National Dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The International Trade Magazine published an article today praising the economic situation of the Philippines as having made great progress. The article is based on a report by Leech, the US Commercial Representative stationed in Manila, stating that all industries in the Philippines have made progress in the first nine months of this year, indicating that the prosperity of the Philippines has gradually recovered. The financial situation of the autonomous government is very good, and all tax revenues have increased compared with last year. Customs duties have increased by more than one-third, and gold production is also improving day by day. 1.5 million tons of raw gold ore have been refined in nine months, and the annual output should reach 44 million pesos. People's interest in other minerals, such as copper, iron, and chromium, has also increased. This year's foreign trade has reached the highest peak in five years. Exports in the past nine months totaled 216,774,000 pesos, an increase of 51% compared with last year. Imports were 150,143,000 pesos, also an increase of 21%. The trade surplus has tripled compared to last year. (National Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The first issue of the US-Philippines Bi-Monthly Journal was published today. Editor Nolasco declared that the magazine's policy is to establish a permanent political and economic relationship to ensure the stability of the Philippines, such as both sides seeking mutually beneficial commercial interests and consolidating the independent happiness of the Filipino people under a fair, free, and democratic system. Economist Clark also wrote an article for the magazine, expressing his failure to report on the Philippines problem. Although Americans regard the Philippines as a part of the United States, they treat it as an uncivilized area. Americans are indeed very concerned about the happiness of Filipinos, but they are unwilling to take responsibility. The United States has a moral responsibility to protect the safety of the Philippines. The magazine also predicts that Philippine Resident Commissioner Palara will be a candidate for President of the Philippine Autonomous Government in 1941. (National Dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>Saint-Nazaire – Another serious labor strike has occurred at the French shipyard, involving about 12,000 workers. This matter will again have a considerable impact on the French naval construction program. It is said that the meeting to be held tonight is likely to announce the abolition of the recently signed labor contracts, and will demand a 15% increase in wages due to the increase in the cost of living. The famous Penhoët shipyard, which undertook the construction of the giant ship Normandie, also had a strike. Because the employer has already implemented a 40-hour work week, they will not allow extra holidays during Christmas and New Year. (Reuters Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e57">French Labor-Management Compulsory Arbitration Law Passed by Senate with Amendments <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The government's proposed bill on compulsory arbitration of labor-management disputes has been discussed back and forth in the Senate and the House of Representatives for several resolutions, but it has not yet been definitively passed. According to the bill, it was passed by the House of Representatives in accordance with the original government proposal on the first of this month, and then after being amended by the Senate on the 18th, it was sent back to the House of Representatives for reconsideration. The House of Representatives passed a new clause on the 23rd and submitted it to the Senate for review. The Senate then handed it over to the Committee on Commerce and Labor yesterday for re-examination and drafted new clauses. Today, the Senate slightly amended the clauses and passed them with a majority of 170 votes to 89 votes. Therefore, the bill must be returned to the House of Representatives for review before a final decision can be made. The clauses passed by the Senate still differ from the clauses of the House of Representatives, which stipulate that full power is granted to the government until June 1, 1937, so as to determine the method of arbitration and mediation. This method is published by order of the Council of State. If the opinions of the two parties in the dispute, or between the arbitrators, cannot be consistent, the Supreme Court or the various courts of appeal will separately appoint arbitrators from industrial and commercial groups to rule on it. These arbitrators should respect the rights of both labor and management to determine an appropriate solution to the dispute. The so-called rights of both labor and management include property rights, the right to organize trade unions, the right to individual freedom of work, and the right to freedom of trade unions. Once the arbitrator makes a ruling, both labor and management should abide by it, and it must be enforced and made public. When the Senate began discussing the bill today, Prime Minister Léon Blum personally attended and delivered a speech, objecting to the provision in the draft of the Committee on Commerce and Labor that "employers have the right to individual dismissal in addition to what the arbitrator has decided," saying that this provision is detrimental to the rights of workers and is biased towards one party. The result will not only fail to ease labor unrest, but will increase disputes. In short, a part of the employers are determined to oppose the arbitration system and want to cancel the concessions made by the capital side to the labor side in June of this year. I hope that the senators will not allow this trend to grow. "Because our ambition is to maintain the harmony between labor and management. What is the way to maintain it? Is it by coercion? Then I say, what we want is a method of social peace. Only this method is suitable for the feelings of the French people and the needs of the international community. It should be known that the maintenance of international peace depends first on the maintenance of internal order in France and the coordination of labor and management." Léon Blum went on to praise the General Confederation of Labor, saying that its efforts to stop labor-management disputes are indeed commendable. Finally, the Senate accepted the Prime Minister's opinion and deleted the section in the draft that employers have the right to individual dismissal, and then voted to pass it.

<h3 id="e64">Foreign Rice Tax Not Approved for Repeal: Guangdong Province Actively Relieving the Rice Shortage, Raising 5 Million to Purchase Rice from Anhui and Hunan, Implementing Rural Loans to Increase Production <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The poor late-rice harvest in Guangdong Province this year has led to soaring rice prices and widespread suffering among the poor. Considering that the winter defense period is approaching, with many unemployed, coupled with the high cost of living, those without stable employment or property are bound to resort to desperate measures for the sake of survival, which will greatly impact social order. Therefore, the military and civilian authorities previously telegraphed the central government, requesting a temporary repeal of the foreign rice tax to facilitate the import of foreign rice and alleviate the food shortage. However, the central government replied that it could not be approved. Consequently, the authorities are seeking alternative remedies, formulating comprehensive measures to address the rice shortage in both the short and long term, proceeding on multiple fronts. The short-term measures involve the Department of Finance convening representatives from the Department of Civil Affairs, the Department of Construction, the Central Bank branch, the Communications Bank branch, the Bank of China branch, and the provincial bank to resolve the establishment of a People's Food Regulation Committee, raising 5 million yuan. The Department of Finance will advance 1 million yuan, with the remaining 4 million yuan to be contributed as loans by various banks in Guangdong Province at reasonable interest rates. This 5 million yuan will be used to purchase rice from Anhui and Hunan provinces to be transported to Guangdong, regulating the food supply in place of foreign rice imports. The committee is scheduled to be established on the 28th, with 15 members, including the governor of Guangdong Province, Huang Musong, the pacification director, Yu Hanmou, the director of the Department of Finance, Song Ziliang, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Wang Yingyu, the director of the Department of Construction, Liu Weizhi, the mayor of Guangzhou, Zeng Yangfu, the representative of the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce, Zou Dianbang, the Rice and Sugar Guild, Han Zhuofu, and representatives from the banking sector, Zhong E, Chen Yuqian, Wen Wanqing, Gu Yiqun, Shen Jing, Wu Kejia, Zhu Ruquan, etc. Huang Musong, Song Ziliang, Chen Yuqian, Gu Yiqun, and Zhong E will serve as standing committee members. Yesterday, a telegram was sent to Shanghai, requesting the Central Bank to entrust the Central Trust Bureau to purchase 20,000 piculs of Wuhu rice from Anhui. As for the 200,000 bags of white rice purchased by Guangdong rice merchants in Hunan some days ago, which were being obstructed by the Hunan Provincial Inspection Bureau, Committee Member Song Ziliang telegraphed He in Hunan yesterday, requesting assistance to facilitate the early transport south for regulation. Once the People's Food Regulation Committee is established and the bank loans are secured, large quantities of rice will be ordered from Anhui and Hunan successively. Regarding Hunan Province, the committee will also pursue a salt-for-rice exchange between Guangdong and Hunan to facilitate trade and address shortages. Currently, both sides are drafting a contract. To fundamentally alleviate the food crisis, the authorities have decided to start by assisting rural areas, providing farmers with loans to increase rural capital and boost rice production, with the goal of achieving food self-sufficiency. Regarding rural loans, the provincial government will first establish a Rural Cooperative Affairs Committee, responsible for management. The committee will send personnel to various villages to guide farmers in forming cooperatives, which will be responsible for receiving and disbursing loans and managing agricultural product mortgages. As for the loan method, the provincial government has decided to allocate a portion of the revenue from tobacco and alcohol excise taxes and stamp duties as capital, dividing the province into ten loan districts. Nine counties, including Shixing in the Northern River region, have been designated as the first batch of loan districts, with a loan amount of 990,000 yuan, allocated as follows: Group 1: Shixing County 30,000 yuan, Nanxiong 200,000 yuan; Group 2: Heshan 350,000 yuan, Xinhui 100,000 yuan; Group 3: Qingyuan 220,000 yuan, Sihui 10,000 yuan; Group 4: Conghua 50,000 yuan, Huaxian 8,000 yuan; Group 5: Yunfu 12,000 yuan. After receiving the order, the Rural Cooperative Affairs Committee dispatched staff member Wang Zhaoming yesterday to Shixing and other counties to guide the formation of cooperatives to facilitate loan disbursement. Telegrams were also sent to the magistrates of the above-mentioned counties for assistance (December 27).</p>
<h3 id="e65">Fuzhou Merchant Guilds' Measures to Alleviate Year-End Financial Difficulties: Financial Maintenance Association Formed by Merchants, Issuing 3 Million Yuan in Circulation Notes, Various Measures Drafted by Provincial Government <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: As the Lunar New Year is approaching, the financial situation in the Fuzhou business community is extremely difficult. Merchant guilds have convened a meeting of representatives and decided to request the provincial government to forward a request to the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank to jointly allocate 5 million yuan for merchants to borrow against real estate collateral. If the four banks cannot implement this, they request permission for the merchants to organize a financial maintenance association, with the merchants providing real estate as collateral, issuing 3 million yuan in circulation notes. The provincial government has forwarded this to the Legislative Affairs Office for review, which has drafted ten measures: (1) A bill and credit maintenance association should be jointly organized by money shops and commercial firms with economic capacity (or a bill acceptance office, bill discounting office, or other name); (2) The bill and credit maintenance association shall be managed by the business community, but the government may send personnel to assist; (3) Commercial firms meeting the requirements of item 1 may join the bill maintenance association at any time. Participants may freely determine a capital contribution amount and provide property equivalent to the participation amount as security. The aforementioned property must be registered and cannot be freely transferred or used as other security during the organizational period; (4) Commercial firms participating in the bill maintenance association may issue or accept bills within the total amount of their registered property; (5) Commercial firms participating in the maintenance association may issue bills when extending loans or repaying debts; (6) Commercial firms participating in the maintenance association must submit bills for issuance or acceptance to the maintenance association for review and approval; (7) Bills approved for issuance according to the preceding item may specify several other participating commercial firms to endorse; (8) Commercial firms participating in the maintenance association shall deposit a portion of the interest earned from issuing, accepting, or endorsing bills with the maintenance association as a fund to compensate for bill losses. If there is a surplus, it shall be distributed proportionally according to the capital contribution amount when the association is dissolved; (9) The maintenance association shall compensate member commercial firms for losses incurred due to bill debts, supplementing any shortfall after legally assisting them in seeking compensation, from the accumulated fund in the preceding item; (10) Disputes arising from bills shall be handled swiftly by an arbitration body organized by the government and the chamber of commerce. The provincial government replied that if the above measures can be effectively implemented, the issuance and payment of bills will have adequate security. The business community will surely be happy to use them, and discounting at banks will also be easy. The government can provide strong assistance within its capabilities. Once the foundation is solid, circulation will naturally expand, and it can replace a portion of the banknotes. Its security is even better than circulation notes. It can maintain itself even without borrowing from banks. The government immediately forwarded these measures to the chamber of commerce for review and implementation. The chamber of commerce convened executive and supervisory committee members and representatives from various merchant guilds on the 25th, starting the meeting at 9 AM and concluding at 4 PM. The merchants deeply appreciated the government's efforts to safeguard commerce and generally agreed with the ten principles. However, they believed that the total amount and duration of bank discounting must be clearly defined before implementation can begin. It was decided to request the government to negotiate two points with the banks: (1) Discounting should be available at any time, up to a total amount of 3 million yuan; (2) The duration should be limited to one year. Chamber of Commerce Chairman Luo Mianhou, Standing Committee Member Hong Fasui, and Supervisory Committee Member Lin Chuncheng were appointed to consult with the Legislative Affairs Office of the provincial government again at 10 AM on the 26th to facilitate the early establishment of the bill and credit maintenance association and smoothly overcome the year-end financial difficulties (December 26).</p>

A telegram of condolence to Chairman Chiang was passed on the spot. The meeting was adjourned for photography at 10 AM, with thousands of firecrackers set off, and the crowd shouted "Long live Chairman Chiang," "Long live the Chinese Kuomintang," and "Long live the Republic of China."

It is learned that the provincial government originally planned to establish the Anhui Meteorological Observatory, and has decided to allocate 150 yuan per month to the Bengbu third-class meteorological observatory for recurring expenses starting from January 26.

<p>— Our European Correspondent, Lieshan</p>
<p>9.  Sacrificing for the Country—General Göring Loses Twenty Pounds</p>
<p>For the past two or three years, Germany has been experiencing "food panics" several times every winter, such as shortages of butter, eggs, meat, etc. Some say that this is a pre-planned scheme by the German military authorities, serving as a kind of national defense test. Others say that the reason lies in Germany's lack of foreign exchange, which reduces the import of butter and other items. The Nazi Party's famous internal propaganda slogan is, "Guns instead of butter." National defense is more important than everything, hoping the people will be patient. The winter of 1936 arrived. General Göring was appointed by Hitler at this time, with full authority to handle Germany's four-year economic plan. The main point of General Göring's first speech was to advise people to "tighten their belts" and cooperate with him to overcome this difficulty together. Germany lacks raw materials, and other countries cannot understand Germany's plight in this regard, so Germany is forced to invent a raw material substitute by using its own chemical industry. He also guaranteed that in four years, Germany's artificial industrial raw materials would definitely be self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Regarding the food problem—lack of eggs, General Göring said that nature is naturally like this. Hens sometimes lay eggs and sometimes they don't. Conversely, people don't have a reason to eat eggs every day. The next day, a Nazi Party newspaper added a large headline to this section: "The government cannot lay eggs."</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding butter, General Göring said that he has recently lost twenty pounds of weight because he often has to do without butter. However, this sentence was not published in German newspapers the next day.</p>
<p>It is speculated that General Göring's weight is about two hundred and fifty pounds—</p>
<p>10. More on General Göring</p>
<p>Among the many important figures in the German National Socialist Party, one of the most popular is General Göring. General Göring holds countless important positions. His titles include Premier of Prussia, Minister of Aviation, Air Force General, Speaker of the German Parliament, Chief of the Political Police, First German Forest Supervisor, First German Hunting Governor, Person in Charge of the Four-Year Economic Plan... and so on. In addition, he is the Director of Prussian Theaters. His new wife, whom he married last year, is an actress.</p>
<p>General Göring loves military uniforms, and his position just happens to provide him with countless uniforms to change into. Therefore, in Berlin social circles or German illustrated magazines, you can often see General Göring and his various military uniforms. General Göring loves medals, and a large number of medals are inseparable from him, just like his military uniforms. There is a large medal that he received during the European War. During the European War, General Göring was a very famous air force officer.</p>
<p>General Göring's position in the Third Reich is second only to Hitler. Many people believe that he is Hitler's future successor. Although he is one of the main figures in the Nazi Party, he usually only pays special attention to military affairs. It can be said that Germany currently possesses a powerful air force thanks to his personal contributions. However, he is not particularly interested in the newly emerging theories of the Nazi Party. In the Nazi Party, he is one of the figures with the least anti-Semitic sentiment.</p>
<p>General Göring's personality can sometimes make people afraid, but sometimes he seems amiable. Over the years, there have been thousands of political jokes circulating among the German people, and most of them are about General Göring. According to a certain reporter who often interacts with General Göring, General Göring once told him that he had ordered his adjutant to collect such jokes and report them to him every day. The subject matter of the jokes mostly involves General Göring's military uniforms and medals. An example:</p>
<p>"Hitler went to the theater one day with General Göring. The scheduled time had passed when Hitler arrived, but General Göring was nowhere to be seen. The male lead on stage, seeing the leader arrive, hurriedly went backstage to greet him without changing his clothes. When he entered the box, Hitler mistook him for General Göring. Hitler said, 'Another new uniform, Hermann (General Göring's nickname). Don't make a fool of yourself!'"</p>
<p>The name Hermann is very common among the German people. Germans often say, "Our Hermann," instead of calling him "General Göring." It is said that General Göring is the most tolerant person in the Nazi Party when it comes to political jokes. When he got married last year, the president of the German Journalists Association informed all members that each person had to write a joke about General Göring and send it directly to him as a congratulatory message, although later no German reporter dared to try.</p>
<p>11. The Art of Propaganda</p>
<p>"It is said that Dr. Goebbels, the German Minister of Propaganda, once sent someone to Mussolini to ask about the art of propaganda: what methods should be used to make people believe? Mussolini said: 'That is a very easy thing to do, that is, the first thing you say to the people must be the truth. After that, no matter how many lies you tell, people will believe you. For example, if the Italian expeditionary force in Abyssinia actually lost three hundred people in a battle, then we will tell the people that our army lost two hundred and fifty people on a certain day, or simply report the facts, because it is the truth, people will definitely believe this sentence. Then we can propagandize whatever we want.' But Dr. Goebbels still found it troublesome and was reluctant to even tell the first truth!"</p>
<p>Smart readers will naturally see that this is also a type of German political joke.</p>
<p>Speaking of the success of the Nazi Party today, we must admire Dr. Goebbels' propaganda genius. Moreover, his position in the Third Reich is only second to General Göring. However, although Dr. Goebbels controls Germany's overall propaganda apparatus, judging by his personal achievements, he does not seem to be as good as the military-style General Göring. At least he has not achieved the point where people would call him "Our Joseph" (the Doctor’s nickname). It is said that he once tried to popularize the term "Our Doctor" among the German people, but it also failed. The reason is that everyone is a little wary and doesn't dare to speak ill of him. His greatest enemy in life is foreign correspondents stationed in Germany, because these reporters often expose his propaganda tricks.</p>
<p>Conversely, General Göring is a true propagandist. He knows that the German people love military uniforms and medals, so he turns himself into the center of political jokes and lets people spread them. The more jokes there are, the more popular General Göring becomes among the people. Only jokes about him can be heard semi-publicly in German cafes and taverns. When he got married, a Berlin news vendor shouted on the street, "Our Hermann is finally married. Why should he be more comfortable than us?" A news vendor can use this kind of language for advertising, which shows how popular General Göring is.</p>
<p>A German said, "We advocate a protectionist tariff policy for the 'export' of General Göring. If other countries want to use him. As for Dr. Goebbels, we not only promote 'free trade,' but even 'encourage exports.'" Here, it seems that we can see the different propaganda methods of each person.</p>
<p>A hotshot who once served as the director of the intelligence department of a certain country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs once told a reporter how difficult it is to announce political news. He said: "When we spread a piece of news, it must not be seen as a lie for at least three weeks. If it is discovered after three weeks, then in fact our propaganda is considered successful. Because people generally don't pay much attention to things from three weeks ago, but only this period of three weeks, in the eyes of people in our bureau, is already longer than three months!"</p>
<p>Propaganda is truly an art!</p>
<p>12. The Nazi Party's Anti-Semitism</p>
<p>Opposition to Jews is clearly stated in the Nazi Party platform. The new laws promulgated at the Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg last year not only stipulated that Jews are not allowed to marry people of Germanic descent, but even German female servants employed in Jewish homes who are under the age of forty-five are to be prohibited; even if the housewife in a family is of German descent and the husband is of Jewish descent, there are no exceptions. The reason lies in protecting the superior Germanic bloodline, so one must "prevent problems before they arise."</p>

<p>Our country's overseas Chinese wrestling master Huang Bochang, since returning to China, has fought three matches in Shanghai and won two, gaining a great reputation for a time, which has aroused the Chinese people's considerable understanding of the wrestling sport that they had previously ignored, and generated a strong interest. On Tuesday evening last week, when Mr. Huang defeated Indian master Piha Fan at St. George's on Du Mei Road, Afghan wrestling master Api Du jumped onto the stage and made wild remarks, setting a date for a challenge. At the same time, taking advantage of Huang's unpreparedness, he pushed him forcefully. Huang endured it and did not compete with him. At that time, the entire audience hated him and all booed him away. Api Du retreated in shame, but his heart was still unwilling. Mr. Huang also felt compelled to respond to the pressure and did not want to show weakness, so he especially scheduled a decisive battle to be held at the original location tonight at 8:30 PM, to compete with each other. The fight will consist of six rounds, each round lasting ten minutes. In addition, there will be a rematch between Mr. Huang's defeated opponent Piha Fan and Khabe Singh, who defeated Peterson, who defeated Akenado. Both people have great ambitions and hope to compete with Mr. Huang, so the battle between the two tonight is tantamount to paving the way for the upcoming bloody battle. Whoever wins will be Mr. Huang's next opponent. There will also be three boxing matches, one of which is the most popular Kaolasha. This person is thin and has a face very similar to the silent film comedic actor Charlie Chaplin, and his movements are humorous and both serious and joking. The match will consist of four rounds, each round lasting two minutes. Ever since this news spread, people from all walks of life have been rushing to reserve seats. Reserved seats are priced at four yuan and three yuan, and open seating is two yuan. Reserved tickets are sold at Qimei Western Restaurant at 133 Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>When Chinese wrestling champion Huang Bochang defeated Indian master Piha Fan at St. George's previously, Mrs. Chen presented him with a beautiful embroidered silk garment, adorned with the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth national flag, which was bright and dazzling. The photo above is of the award ceremony.</p>

<p>Three West Qing basketball games were held last night. Two were in the university division: Nanyang forfeited to Chizhi, and Nanching defeated St. John's by a large margin, 39-15. One was in the independent division: Xintong defeated Qingguang, 55-35. The first half was extremely intense, with Xintong only leading by five points, 23-18.</p>
<p>The Nanching-St. John's match turned into a one-sided affair. St. John's played disorganized and chaotic. Nanching took a 15-2 lead and finished the first half 20-8. In the second half, St. John's briefly showed signs of revival, but then retreated, ultimately losing 39-15 to Nanching's big win.</p>
<p>The Qingguang-Xintong game started next. Qingguang consisted of veterans of the arena. Although their physical strength may have declined, their form was still present. They were unhurried, completely different from the previous game, which was even more shocking. Qingguang took the lead all the way, 12-8, 14-10, 18-13. At this point, Xintong scored six consecutive points to take the lead. Lan Genlai Yin then scored four points, making the first half 23-19. In the second half, Qingguang's defense gradually loosened in terms of physical strength, and Xintong soared, scoring seventeen consecutive points after being up 27-24. Qingguang occasionally scored from then on, but it was of no use. The result was 55-35.</p>

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the ceremony, Chairman Wu Kaixian first gave a report, stating in brief: "Today is the Shanghai Citizens' Celebration Rally for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Return to Nanjing. So many compatriots have participated so enthusiastically, which truly demonstrates the sincerity of our Shanghai citizens in supporting our leader. The time when Chairman Chiang was in distress in Xi'an was not long, but everyone felt indignant and depressed. On the evening of the 25th, when the news of Chairman Chiang's safe arrival in Luoyang spread, the entire city immediately erupted in firecrackers. The scene of joy and excitement can simply be described as madness. This proves our passionate desire for the leader's return. Today, our Shanghai citizens are holding celebration rallies by district to celebrate the safe return of the leader of our Chinese nation. It can also be said that we are celebrating that the Chinese nation will become more prosperous from now on, because Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is the savior of our nation. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is safe, and he will surely lead us to implement the national policies of resisting foreign aggression, saving the country, and revitalizing the nation. This is a major and profound meaning that participating citizens should understand. At the same time, we should recognize the following three points: First, after the Xi'an Incident, all compatriots were worried and anxious. From this, we can recognize that compatriots have a deep understanding of Chairman Chiang, recognizing that Chairman Chiang is our only savior and only leader. Second, although compatriots across the country were worried and anxious after the incident, they were able to remain calm as usual, which proves that our country has a sound organization and is not as scattered and flustered as in the past. Third, our leader's safe return is entirely the result of the leader's personality and prestige. This shows the greatness and brilliance of the leader's personality. Therefore, after celebrating the leader's safe return to Nanjing, we compatriots should even more support the leader and lead us to work hard in the great cause of resisting foreign aggression, saving the country, and revitalizing the nation," and so on.</p>
<p>Summary of Speeches</p>
<p>After the Chairman's report, Li Dachao, representing Mayor Wu, gave a speech, stating in brief: "Today, we celebrate Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing with such joy. Our only leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, has returned safely, which can be described as joy for all people. Recalling the anxiety and indignation of the people after the Xi'an Incident, it is indescribable, and there is a world of difference compared to today's joy. This shows the citizens' expression of support for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek," and so on. Then, Zhao Weixian, representing Commander Yang, gave a speech, stating in brief: "Today, at the celebration rally for the Supreme Leader's return to Nanjing, everyone is excited and happy. How gloomy it was a dozen days ago, and how joyful it is today. This shows the people's love for Chairman Chiang. Our nation should further work hard in all aspects under the leader's leadership. This is the meaning of today's meeting. This city, as the forefront of national defense, should continue to work harder to complete the mission of revitalizing civil rights," and so on. Then, Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, stating in brief: "Supporting Chairman Chiang is the psychology of compatriots across the country. The ancient saying says, 'Adversity strengthens a nation,' which is the current situation. It is impossible to express it in peacetime, but this time Chairman Chiang suffered misfortune in Xi'an, which showed the people's enthusiasm for supporting Chairman Chiang. After Chairman Chiang issued a written statement, we can better understand Chairman Chiang's generosity, which shows that this safe return to Nanjing was also caused by sincerity," and so on. Then, Du Yuesheng gave a speech, stating in brief: "Today is the celebration rally for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's return to Nanjing, which expresses the citizens' enthusiasm for supporting Chairman Chiang and rejoicing. Chairman Chiang was able to return safely because of his great personality. The people of the whole country, in addition to being gratified, all support Chairman Chiang, hoping that he will continue to lead the revolution and complete the mission of revitalizing the nation," and so on. Finally, Li Xiangqi gave a speech, stating in brief: "Today, citizens of this city are holding a celebration rally for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's return to Nanjing. In the past two weeks, after the Xi'an Incident occurred, the people of the whole country were all saddened and indignant. The reason is that Chairman Chiang is the only leader and the only savior of the nation. Once he is in distress, it is the distress of the country and the nation. Everyone is willing to replace him with their own body. Letters and telegrams flew from all over, and many places formed welcoming and protecting groups. This kind of performance has never been seen before and cannot be resisted by any force. Therefore, Zhang Xueliang was able to realize this situation and escort Chairman Chiang back to Nanjing. Now that the Xi'an Incident has been resolved, the future great difficulties of the nation and the country will of course depend on Chairman Chiang to lead and resolve," and so on.</p>

Each participant held a slogan or Party and National flag, with high spirits. The procession was as long as 20 li. When the vanguard returned to Heping Road and disbanded, more than half of the rear teams had not yet set off, which shows the enthusiasm and excitement of the participants. When the parade marched around the city, the crowds of onlookers along the way were massive. Shops and residents set off firecrackers loudly, and the sound echoed through the clouds. Wherever Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's portrait passed, citizens took off their hats to pay respect. The parade team shouted slogans along the way, and the audience also shouted along, which shows how deeply Chairman Chiang is loved.</p>
<p>Four Telegrams</p>
<p>(1) "Telegram of Condolence to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Requesting Him to Continue Leading the Revolution, Thoroughly Implement the National Policy of Resisting Foreign Aggression and Saving the Country, and Revitalize the Nation." Respected Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of Nanjing, Your Excellency, Your escape from danger this time, with the sun reappearing after darkness, and the news spreading, has made all people celebrate. You, sir, are the only savior of the nation. Since leading the revolution, you have worked diligently day and night, and the entire people admire you. Hereafter, we still hope that you will adhere to your inherent sincerity, follow the central government's national policy of resisting foreign aggression and eliminating traitors, lead the people, and actively strive to break through the current national crisis in the shortest possible time, thoroughly achieving the goals of saving the country and ensuring its survival, and revitalizing the nation, so as to promote national prestige and comfort the people's hopes. The telegraph expresses our deepest expectations. Respectfully, the Shanghai Citizens' Celebration Rally for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. (2) Telegram to the whole country, unanimously supporting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to continue leading the revolution, implement the national policy of resisting foreign aggression and saving the country, and revitalize the nation. Please forward to compatriots across the country, all newspaper offices. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's escape from danger, with the sun reappearing after darkness, and the news spreading, has made all people rejoice. However, the Red bandits have not yet been completely suppressed, and the border bandits are still thinking of making trouble. With internal and external troubles, the national crisis is deepening. Breaking through the current national crisis still depends on Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's leadership and active struggle. From now on, compatriots across the country must absolutely support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, follow the central government's policy of stabilizing the country internally and resisting foreign aggression externally, and continue to lead the revolution in order to complete the great cause of resisting foreign aggression, saving the country, and revitalizing the nation. We hereby send this telegram, hoping for unanimous support. It would be fortunate for the Party and the country. Respectfully, the Shanghai Citizens' Celebration Rally for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. (3) "Telegram of Condolence to the Suiyuan Anti-Bandit Soldiers, Urging Them to Continue Their Efforts." (Omitted above) The generals and soldiers, for the survival of the country and the life of the nation, have bravely fought with their flesh and blood, recovering Bailingmiao in one fell swoop and Damaozi in another. Their great achievements are recorded in history. At this time when the three armies are fighting with their lives and enduring the cold on the snow-covered ground, Zhang Yang's two units suddenly rebelled, seizing the commander and committing treason, speaking for the enemy bandits, reducing the country's strength in resisting foreign aggression and suppressing bandits, and causing a major blow to the nation's revitalization. Fortunately, our generals and soldiers at the front understand the great righteousness and are not moved by the absurd arguments of the rebels. They are not disturbed by the commander's misfortune. They have always remained calm and continued to work hard according to the central government's established national policy of resisting the enemy and defending against foreign aggression, so that the enemy cannot take advantage of the opportunity. This shows the generals' and soldiers' loyalty to the Party and the country, their support for the leader, and their perseverance in the face of hardship and danger. The people of the whole country are deeply gratified. Now that Chairman Chiang's sincerity has moved people and the chief culprits have repented, he has safely escaped and returned to Nanjing to continue presiding over the Party and the country's major plans. After the melee, when the generals and soldiers hear this good news, they will surely rejoice and be even more brave to deal with the enemy bandits. We eagerly await the news of victory. In the enthusiastic atmosphere of joy and commendation, the conference unanimously resolved to telegraph an award to the generals and soldiers, and prayed that under the leadership of the central government, they would quickly quell the bandit rebellion and recover the lost territory. The people in the rear will naturally provide continuous assistance to fulfill their national duty. We respectfully report this. Respectfully, the Shanghai Citizens' Celebration Rally for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. (4) Telegram of Condolence to the Soldiers and Civilians Who Died in the Xi'an Incident. To the families of the soldiers and civilians who died in Xi'an, Zhang Yang's two units, when unification had just been completed and the whole country was united and striving to resist foreign aggression and suppress bandits, suddenly lost their minds and acted recklessly, committing treason and seizing the commander, making reckless claims. After two weeks, the central government rectified discipline and issued a clear order to punish them. The people of the whole country also rose up in response, issuing telegrams denouncing them. As a result, justice was greatly promoted and the rebels were terrified. Chairman Chiang safely escaped amid the enthusiastic cheers of the people. Since Chairman Chiang's safety is linked to the safety of the whole country, compatriots across the country, upon hearing the good news, all turned their tears into joy. However, this sudden incident resulted in countless people bravely defending Chairman Chiang and national life, fighting against the rebel army, and making heroic sacrifices. As far as we know, there are Mr. Shao Yiru, a member of the Central Committee, Mr. Jiang Xiaoxian, head of the Chairman's Headquarters Guard Group, Mr. Xiao Naihua, Secretary, Mr. Ma Zhiyuan, Director of the Public Security Bureau, and the Chairman's Guards, who almost all died in the line of duty. The number of soldiers and civilians in Shaanxi who were brutally killed in this turmoil is even more than a thousand. We cannot help but express our deepest condolences to the martyrs. However, although the martyrs have sacrificed their lives, their great achievements in safeguarding the leader and loving the country are enough to shine through the ages, like the sun and the moon. The central government, remembering their past merits, will provide appropriate condolences to encourage those who come after. We hope you will restrain your grief and maintain your aspirations, and value the country. We hereby send this telegram of condolence. We hope you will consider it. Shanghai Citizens'</p>

Although the tracks above Weinan have been repaired by the engineering department, the tracks are blocked by vehicles, including 50 locomotives and more than 500 carriages. Efforts are being made to move them out. Two rows of Blue Steel carriages that were destroyed (which were used by Commander-in-Chief Chiang) were destroyed at Xi'an Station and will be transported to the factory for repair immediately. More than ten employees who were killed, such as those at Xi'an and Weinan stations, will be given preferential treatment. More than 10,000 tons of freight for joint transportation to Xi'an and other places are blocked in Lianyungang. Therefore, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the railway's joint transportation services are temporarily suspended for goods to Tongguan and above until the goods in Lianyungang are cleared. The company's losses, in terms of business, are estimated to be more than 2 million yuan. The loss of property is greater than the business loss.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Materials for Replacing Rails on the Hangzhou-Yushan Section Borrowed from Domestic and Foreign Loans <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Council, in order to replace the heavy rails on the Yushan-Yupu section of the Hangzhou-Yushan section, will replace the original 35-pound rails with 63-pound heavy rails. The required project cost is 2.8 million yuan. After negotiating with the China Farmers Bank, the China Land Bank of Zhejiang, and other banks to borrow funds, a draft agreement has been signed, stipulating an annual interest rate of 1% and repayment in six years. China is borrowing 1.8 million, and the China Farmers Bank and the Zhejiang Land Bank are each borrowing 500,000. The entire revenue of the Hangzhou-Yushan section will be used as collateral. Jin Runquan, the representative of the banking group, traveled back and forth between Shanghai and Hangzhou to consult and negotiate, and it has now been fully successful. A formal contract will be signed immediately and funds will begin to be collected. Therefore, with the funds in place for the rail replacement project, construction is scheduled to begin on New Year's Day next year, so that it can be completed at the same time as the completion deadline of the Nanping section project in March. However, in addition to the rail replacement project cost, a huge amount of materials such as rails and sleepers are needed. According to a reporter from Shen Shi News Agency's investigation in the banking industry, the Ministry of Railways is currently conducting a material loan from the Czech Railway Material Factory, requiring about 28,000 tons, worth 6 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 4% to 5%, also repayable in six years. It will be handled in accordance with the method of the Beijing-Jiangxi Railway borrowing 80 million from the German Otto Wolff Iron Factory. It is currently progressing smoothly and can be formally signed in the short term. Before the material loan is signed, the rail replacement materials will temporarily borrow the materials stored in the Nanping section for general use. It is planned to complete the traffic plan of the Hangyu, Yunan, and Nanping roads in March next year to facilitate transportation and enrich national income.</p>

<p>Zheng Youchang, also known as Haitao and Yufen, a Cantonese person, runs the Youchang Awning Factory at No. 38, Lane 423, East Broadway Road. He has three children. His youngest son, Zheng Fayuan, is only twelve years old and is studying at the Shanghai Municipal Council's primary school. He is quite clever but likes to steal things. He had previously stolen and spent his father's money. On the 25th of this month, at half-past two in the morning, Zheng Fayuan took advantage of his parents' absence and stole his father's</p>
<p>A wallet containing 150 yuan in legal currency and a platinum watch of the "Ever Read" brand, with a total value of more than 300 yuan, and took it outside. At 5:45 PM, he went to Room 317 of the Cangzhou Hotel on Jingan Temple Road, wrote the name Zhang Zhongfa in the registration book, lived at No. 2 Aihua Lane, Ever Read Road, and claimed to be the son of Zhang Fakui, the Commander-in-Chief of the bandit suppression area in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces of the National Government, and said that he still had</p>
<p>Two guards who would come later. The hotel servants did not doubt his false identity and treated him with great courtesy. At that time, Zheng Hai also told a servant named Wang Shiyuan that his income in Shanghai was very meager and that he would help him find a good job in Hankou, and asked Wang to accompany him to play. On the morning of the 26th, at 8:00 AM, Zheng hired a taxi and went to the Guanshengyuan teahouse for breakfast, then took the original car to play in the city center. At noon, he went to the Chunjiang Restaurant for lunch. At 3:30 PM, he went to the</p>
<p>Golden Theater to watch a play. The cost of the taxi alone reached 12 yuan. The manager of the Cangzhou Hotel, seeing that the child had no family members with him and behaved lavishly, became suspicious and reported to the Jingan Temple Police Station by telephone. Detective Zhang Liang and a Western detective were ordered to go to the Golden Grand Theater and found Zheng Hai. They searched him and found 40 yuan in legal currency and an "Ever Read" platinum watch, and took them back to the police station for questioning about his address. At first, he claimed to live at No. 2 Aihua Lane, Ever Read Road, but after investigation, it was found that there was no door number at No. 2 Aihua Lane. The child then claimed to live in Jiangwan Park Lane</p>
<p>Chen Bingqian's residence. Chen's family all said that they did not know this child. Finally, Zheng Hai confessed the truth. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court and Lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the situation, prosecuting him for theft under Articles 320 and 324, Section 2 of the Criminal Code, and said</p>
<p>"It has been found that the defendant Zheng Fayuan is not yet twelve years old. Today his father has come to court and requested to take him back for custody. This lawyer has no objection." When questioned, Zheng Hai confessed to stealing his father's money. Then Zheng Youchang surrendered himself and requested to take him back for custody. Judge Pan Zhenyang verified the confession and ordered Zheng Fayuan to be acquitted and handed over to his father Zheng Haitao for custody for two years and six months.</p>

<p>The case of the assassination of Japanese mining engineer Kaya-o Kōsaku involved Mao Yonghu, Wang Zhensheng, Zhao Yunhong, Jin Daoquan, and Zhu Guisheng and Chen Enming, who were preparing to continue killing Japanese people, as well as the women Wang Zai and Zhang Ma, who supplied guns and ammunition to Mao Yonghu, etc., totaling eight people. The Shanghai District Court publicly tried the case, and after the conclusion of the arguments, the sentencing was scheduled for 2:00 PM on the 28th of this month. Yesterday was the scheduled date, and the Japanese Consulate sent Chief Inspector Kuchi Yanagi Saemon from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, along with Kawashima Tsutomu from the Inspectorate of the Public Works Department, who were guided by Zhang Youji, a clerk from the Third Section of the Municipal Police Bureau, to</p>
<p>observe the proceedings in court. The court ordered Police Chief Zhang Shuping and Chen Xihui to supervise all the bailiffs and be on guard in the First Criminal Court. At three o'clock, Presiding Judge Cai Dingcheng, the head of the Criminal Court, along with Judges Shao Qinshi and Li Xuedeng, Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu, and Clerk Zhou Yuejuan, arrived at the court. They also notified the appointed defense attorneys Yu Chengxiu and Shi Qinghua, both lawyers, to come to court. They ordered the eight defendants to be brought to the case. The presiding judge and others stood up and read the</p>
<p>main text of the judgment. Mao Yonghu and Wang Zhensheng were both sentenced to death for jointly committing continuous murder, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. Zhao Yunhong was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for assisting in murder, with ten years of deprivation of civil rights. Jin Daoquan was sentenced to thirteen years of imprisonment for assisting in and preparing for murder, with ten years of deprivation of civil rights. Zhu Guisheng and Chen Enming were each sentenced to two years of imprisonment for preparing for murder. Wang Zai was sentenced to two years of imprisonment for repeatedly transporting firearms. Zhang Ma was sentenced to</p>
<p>one year of imprisonment for transporting firearms. One six-round revolver, six bullets, and one cartridge case were confiscated. After the reading was finished, the presiding judge briefly announced the reasons for the judgment, stating that Mao Yonghu and Wang Zhensheng's previous confessions were consistent with the facts, and their crimes had been proven, and the circumstances were relatively serious, therefore they were sentenced to death. As for Zhao Yunhong and Jin Daoquan, the prosecutor originally charged them with inciting murder, but the court's investigation found that it could not be proven, but the circumstances of assistance, according to their confessions, were very clear, so they were reduced to</p>
<p>the crime of assistance. The fact that Zhu Guisheng and Chen Enming were preparing to kill other Japanese people has also been proven and cannot be denied. As for Wang Zai, she collected and transported firearms three times, and the circumstances were more serious, so she should be punished severely. Zhang Ma's crimes were relatively few, so she was sentenced to one year of imprisonment, and so on. The detailed reasons will be sent with the judgment. When asked if the defendants accepted the judgment, each defendant claimed to be dissatisfied and would appeal within ten days after receiving the judgment. They were then taken back into custody.</p>

<p>Chen Zhenhua, a 24-year-old Shaoxing native residing on the front floor of No. 8 Pingjiang Lane, Lan Weiai Road, in the French Concession, lived with his wife. Chen worked as a salesman at a certain soy sauce shop. Due to business relations, he became acquainted with Tong Guohua, an Yixing woman (30 years old) residing at No. 62 Xinling Village, Caishi Road. On the night of the 27th of this month, at 11:00 PM, Chen, accompanied by his wife, planned to steal from Tong's home. He instructed his wife to wait inside Xinling Village Lane, while he entered Tong's house alone. Under the pretext of visiting, they engaged in casual conversation. As it was cold, Tong hospitably offered to make tea for the guest. Seeing Tong leave to fetch water, Chen immediately seized the opportunity and fled with Tong's overcoat, silk gauze, and cotton quilt. When Tong returned home with the water, Chen and the stolen items were gone. She inquired around and coincidentally encountered a rickshaw puller who had taken Chen home. The rickshaw puller, upon hearing the situation, volunteered, saying that he had just taken a man and a woman with packages to No. 8 Pingjiang Lane, Lan Weiai Road, and was willing to lead the way. Tong then instructed the rickshaw puller to guide her. Chen, upstairs, heard the knocking and, feeling guilty, climbed to the roof in an attempt to escape. He was spotted by one of the people who had come along, who shouted and stopped him. Chen had no choice but to come down from the roof and return to the house. Tong also followed in, and the stolen goods were clearly in sight. She immediately reported to the French Concession police, who sent Detective Kang Yutian to take Chen and the stolen goods to the police station. Yesterday, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special Second District, where Judge Chen Shuoying interrogated them. Police Department lawyer Chen Ming presented the case, requesting a postponement for further investigation and then prosecution. Then, the plaintiff stated the process of the defendant coming to visit and stealing. The defendant confessed without denial. The court ordered the case to be reheard on the 31st, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<p>The section of Pintang Lane, Shanxi Road, from the Nanjing Road intersection to the Tianjin Road intersection, has always been occupied by small fruit hawkers. However, the Nanjing Hotel is also located here, and traffic is frequent. However, the hawkers still gather as before, resulting in traffic obstruction between noon and evening. The Public Works Department Police Department found out about the situation and ordered the Chinese police on duty in that section to strictly ban them. However, the hawkers came back after being driven away, and they never disappeared. At about 8:00 AM yesterday, Chinese policeman No. 239 on duty in that section saw that there were more than a dozen fruit stalls resting and selling there, so he immediately stepped forward to drive them away. However, Wang Fugen, a local, 28 years old, stopped and rested his stall as before. The Chinese policeman believed that he did not obey the order and immediately arrested him. It was unexpected that Wang immediately threw the bricks used to press the stall at the policeman, resisting arrest. At this time, more than a dozen fruit vendors who had been dispersed saw it and came back together, surrounding the Chinese policeman and forcing him to release Wang. For a time, the situation was turbulent and the order was disrupted. The Chinese policeman knew that he was outnumbered, so he hurriedly blew the whistle for help. More than a dozen fruit vendors saw that the incident was escalating and immediately shouted and beat him. The Chinese policeman was in a hurry and immediately drew his gun and fired three shots, one hitting Wang Fugen's left leg, one hitting a pedestrian, Li Xigen, a Dalian native, 43 years old, in the leg, and one hitting Jiangbei female beggar Liu Xiaoqing in the leg. More than a dozen fruit vendors fled without a trace. The Laozha Police Station in charge received the report and hurriedly sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate the truth, and also sent the Chinese policeman back to the police station for interrogation. On the one hand, they sent the three injured men and women to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>The Baxianqiao branch of the China Kenye Bank, located at No. 143 and 145 Mintiniyin Road in the French Concession, is headed by Yao Dexin, and the business department is staffed by women. The business hours are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day except for holidays. At about 4:00 PM yesterday, two bandits suddenly came, holding a pistol, jumped over the counter next to the cashier's office, and forbade them from making a sound. The female employees of the bank were all petrified. The bandits snatched 2,036 yuan in cash (including one-yuan, five-yuan, and ten-yuan subsidiary coins) placed in the rattan basket next to the desk in the cashier's office, hid it on their bodies, and jumped out of the counter. At this time, Chuan Shijun, the doorman from Beiping, saw it. He hid behind the counter on the west side and was about to draw his pistol and shoot, but the bullet jammed. The bandits saw it and carried out their plan to strike first. They held the gun and fired several shots at the guard. The guard was shot in the ribs and fell to the ground. Two holes were also shot in the wall on the west side of the bank. The bandits then went out and fled. When the robbery was being committed, the French Police Station had received the alarm and immediately sent a large number of Chinese and Western detectives in police cars to round up the bandits, but the bandits had already fled far away. They then sent the injured guard to Guangci Hospital for treatment. It was reported that the injuries were quite serious. It is said that there were a total of four bandits involved in the robbery. Two were on guard outside the door, and two entered the bank to commit the robbery. When the bandits opened fire to resist arrest, Zhang Yongnian, a Ningbo native who was an employee of Tianxiang Fashion Company on Fourth Malu, happened to be going to the bank to withdraw money. He witnessed the shooting and fled in panic. Afterwards, Chinese and Western detectives from the French Police Station went to the bank to inquire about the robbery and ordered the arrest of the bandit gang for interrogation.</p>

<p>Yu Xing, the accounting director of the Haiyan County Public Security Bureau, took leave and came to Shanghai on the 25th of the month, opening a room at No. 505 Huizhong Hotel on Hankou Road. His cousin Jiang Hua was studying at Liangcai School. That evening, Yu took Jiang Hua and Jiang's female classmate Li Chen out to play at the dance hall. When they returned at 2:00 AM, they saw the window along the veranda was open. They checked their belongings and found that the jewelry, silver dollars, and overcoat placed in the room had disappeared. They immediately reported to the front desk. Next door to Yu, room No. 506, was occupied by two Western-dressed men. After Yu and others went out, the two men also went out with a woman and did not return until about 9:00 PM. They then closed the door. At about 4:00 AM, they paid the room fee and left. When the tea boy entered the room to clean up, he saw that the quilt on the bed was raised, as if someone was sleeping. He looked closely and there was no one sleeping. He lifted the quilt and found an overcoat inside, which was one of the missing items. He then determined that Yu's belongings must have been stolen by the two men who broke into the room. He reported to the police station for investigation, but there was no progress. Then, at about 5:00 AM yesterday, a similar incident occurred in room No. 513 of the Xinxin Hotel on Nanjing Road. After reporting to the Laozha Police Station, Detective Chen Shanji was ordered to go to investigate. He believed that it must have been done by the guests in the neighboring room, so he investigated. He investigated room No. 511 and saw two men in suits living inside, whose faces were the same as the guests in No. 506 Huizhong. He then arrested them and found some of the stolen goods in the room (that is, the items stolen from No. 513 Xinxin) and took them back to the police station. After questioning, the two men were identified as Cao Jihou, from Anhui, and Xu Rongqing, from Ningbo. The Huizhong tea boy confirmed that it was them without error. They were then transferred to the Second Criminal Court of the Special First District. The police lawyer Chen Ming presented the case, stating that the two men had just been arrested and had not yet been thoroughly investigated, so he requested that they be detained. He also presented records of the two men's previous theft cases. After Judge Pan interrogated them, he ordered a postponement for another hearing.</p>

<p>Tong Feng Yong Clothing Company, located at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Fourth Malu, is an old Western clothing store in this city with more than 20 years of history, specializing in fashionable European and American men's and women's overcoats, new-style Western clothing, raincoats, etc. Mr. Sun, the owner of the store, recently hired a Russian technician to guide the sewing. In order to eliminate the bad habit of haggling in slippery stores, he advocated the principle of small profits and quick sales. In mid-December, a large number of materials were shipped from Europe and the United States. In consideration of social economy, a new type of economical clothing was launched. For example, a new style of plaid flannel-lined leather collar overcoat is only sold for 13.5 yuan, a plain-colored flannel fox fur collar overcoat is 16.5 yuan each, and a twill flannel overcoat with a wooden raccoon fur collar is 19.8 yuan. Each piece earns only three or four corners in addition to the cost. It is completely different from those on the market who sing about great sacrifices and great bargains. Ladies from all walks of life may wish to try it to know that the words are not misleading.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Notice from the Rickshaw Industry Association to All Rickshaw Owners: The Abolition of the Non-Redemption Group Magnet Badge if Not Redeemed <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>In the rickshaw industry of this city, there has long been a dark side of stealing rickshaws and extorting ransoms, which has aggravated the suffering of rickshaw pullers. Since the establishment of the Rickshaw Industry Association's non-redemption group in May of last year, rickshaw owners have voluntarily paid 5 cents per vehicle per month to punish rickshaw thieves, transfer vagrants to labor camps, and compensate for all losses after rickshaw theft. For more than a year now, although no less than 200 rickshaws have been stolen in the north and south of the city, the majority of them have been compensated with rubber accessories by the group, and only a small number have been fully compensated with new rickshaws. When a rickshaw puller's rickshaw is stolen, they are liable for a maximum of six yuan and a minimum of three yuan, which is a great benefit to the average rickshaw puller compared to the fifteen or sixteen yuan extorted in the past. Recently, the Municipal Public Works Bureau believes that such organizations are limited to the south of Shanghai and Zhabei, and intends to uniformly implement this measure for all rickshaws in the Shanghai West Special Zone, which will be undertaken by insurance companies. After several consultations, the trend is already emerging, and it is expected to be established soon. However, the non-redemption group magnet badge nailed to the back of each rickshaw is considered no longer necessary to exist. A special order was issued to the Rickshaw Industry Association to abolish it. The association believes that since the new organization has not yet been established, the impact will be significant if it is abolished suddenly. It therefore requested a postponement of implementation and separately notified all rickshaw owners to inform all rickshaw pullers to comply with the police instructions for the abolition to avoid causing misunderstandings. Currently, many rickshaw owners have voluntarily abolished it, awaiting the authorities' proper handling of the aftermath to prevent rickshaw thieves from making a comeback.</p>

<p>Romanian Saiming, the owner of the Sanmin Palace Ballroom at the intersection of Beichuan Road and Qiujiang Road in Zhabei, was 77 years old.

It was extinguished by the staff, and only documents and other objects were destroyed, with no other losses. However, Saiming was found dead on the ground, with two wounds on his head caused by a weapon, and blood flowing straight down, which was extremely strange. The Beisichuan Road Police Station in charge of the district dispatched police to investigate upon receiving the report. Five Westerners and Chinese suspected of being involved in the ballroom were detained for a brief interrogation and sent to the General Bureau. Huang Hua, the chief of the third section, questioned the case at around 10:00 AM yesterday morning. Due to the strange circumstances, he personally went to the scene to investigate and took many fingerprint photographs to begin investigating the perpetrator.</p>

<p>In Huajing Township, Shanghai County, there is a young man named Qian Sanduo, who is a student at Nanyang Middle School. On the first day of this month, while congratulating a classmate on their wedding, he passed through Caojia Bridge in Xixiang. It happened that Sun Qiulin, who lived in Changqiao Township, was using counterfeit Farmer Bank banknotes there. Policeman Tan Shaoyun arrested Sun and also detained Qian Sanduo, who was taken to the County Public Security Bureau and transferred to the local court. Qian Sanduo became ill from fear and was released on bail by his family. Sun was detained. Prosecutor Li filed a public prosecution. The case was tried by Judge Zhang yesterday. Qian Sanduo was not present due to illness, but Sun Qiulin confessed that he had found 38 banknotes at Caojia Bridge. He said that he went to buy cigarettes and was told that they were fake, but he did not know Qian Sanduo. Witness Tan Shaoyun said, "I was patrolling in Caoxing Town and saw 20 fake banknotes on the ground. Sun Qiulin was running in front, so I arrested him. I also recovered 18 banknotes from the river. Qian Sanduo was walking in front, so I arrested him as well, but no fake banknotes were found in his pocket." At this point, the official adjourned the debate and announced that the verdict would be announced on the 31st.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Special Feature: Production, Sales and Manufacturing of Keemun Black Tea (Continued from the 26th) <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Keemun black tea is a high-grade tea, often fetching double the price of ordinary black tea. Its excellent quality, though expensive, is favored by Westerners. In particular, the British people are most fond of Keemun. Domestic consumption of Keemun tea is very low; almost all of the annual production is exported. In the past, Britain accounted for over 50% of the total export volume, followed by France and Germany, and then by countries such as the Soviet Union and the Netherlands. According to the export statistics of our bureau's tea inspection, the situation of Keemun exports to various countries in the past four years is listed in the table below:</p>
<p>The export volume of Keemun tea varies from month to month. The new tea is generally available on the market in mid-May, and Keemun exports are most prosperous in June. The amount of Keemun exported in June each year often reaches around 7,000 metric tons. After July, it gradually decreases. The following table shows the export trends for each month:</p>
<p>Monthly Export Volume of Keemun Black Tea in the Past Four Years (Unit: Metric Tons)</p>
<p>The above three tables have a common point that readers should pay attention to: the actual export volume of Keemun tea may not be as high as indicated. Occasionally, exporting foreign firms mix a small amount of other black tea into Keemun tea to enhance its reputation. However, since Keemun tea is still the main component, it is difficult to call it other tea. Therefore, this is specially noted to dispel doubts.</p>
<p>Keemun tea is one of our country's export teas. In addition to Keemun, other exported black teas include Hunan and Hubei's "Hu Hong" (Hubei Black), Jiangxi's Ning Hong (Ningzhou Black) from counties like Xiushui, Zhejiang's Wen Hong (Wenzhou Black) from areas around Yongjia, and Fujian's Fu Hong (Fujian Black). The position of Keemun's export volume among all exported black teas is worthy of research.</p>
<p>Percentage of Keemun Tea in Total Exported Black Tea</p>
<p>From the table above, the export volume of Keemun tea only accounts for about 20% of the total tea volume, which is less than that of other lower-grade black teas. In terms of value, there are no separate statistics for the export value of Keemun tea. However, since Keemun is of superior quality and high price, its value is naturally more expensive. Therefore, it can be asserted that the percentage of its value in the export of black tea is higher than the percentage of its quantity.</p>
<p>The world's tea-producing countries export approximately 800 million pounds of black tea annually, equivalent to 3.6 million metric tons. Keemun exports about 20,000 metric tons annually, accounting for only 6/1000th of the total. It can be seen that Keemun's position is very weak. Our countrymen are accustomed to the name of Keemun, but they do not know that the production and sales of Keemun are not comparable to Indian or Ceylon black tea. In comparison, it is like a small witch seeing a great one. Our countrymen should be aware of this. However, the future of Keemun tea still has ample room for development.</p>
<p>(3) Reasons for Fluctuations in Keemun Black Tea Market Prices</p>
<p>Keemun black tea has a small output and excellent quality. It has always been favored by people in countries such as Britain and the United States, so the price is very high. Domestic sales are very small, and it is mainly for export. Therefore, the market price of Keemun tea is affected by the supply and demand of black tea in the world on one hand, and it also changes due to foreign exchange rates on the other. As a result, tea prices fluctuate up and down. In particular, the market price of Keemun tea is extremely volatile, sometimes high and sometimes low, making it difficult to grasp. Fortunately, since the government implemented the legal tender policy last November, foreign exchange rates have stabilized, and tea prices are no longer in danger of sudden highs and lows. Tea merchants will also not suffer unexpected losses. The exchange rate problem has been solved, and tea prices can be stabilized, but the reality is not so. Although tea prices vary greatly due to differences in quality, the same batch of tea, of the same quality, often has very different prices due to the timing of transactions and different supply and demand conditions. This is especially true for Keemun tea, where the market price on the opening day of the new tea can differ by dozens of yuan from the market price on the second day. Therefore, the risk of operating tea is very high. Timely transportation and sales can bring double or even several times the profit; conversely, it can lead to bankruptcy. Because of this, tea prices increase, tea firms spring up like mushrooms to take advantage of it, and when tea prices fall, tea merchants struggle to survive. The main reason is that tea prices cannot be stabilized. Considering world tea consumption, black tea is the most consumed. Besides our country, the producing countries include India, Ceylon, and the Dutch East Indies. These countries have come from behind, and our country's foreign trade in black tea is just barely the fourth-largest exporter. Because we cannot control supply and demand, nor can we control the world market price of black tea, the price rises and falls according to the supply and demand of black tea in the world. If supply exceeds demand, the price falls; conversely, if demand exceeds supply, the market price rises. In summary, there are two main reasons for price fluctuations in Keemun tea: one is the changes in international black tea supply and demand, and the other is the fluctuations in exchange rates. Looking back at the situation in previous years, it becomes even clearer.</p>
<p>(4) Market Prices of Keemun Black Tea in the Last Ten Years</p>
<p>Keemun tea prices have always been very high, and the market price varies depending on the quality. The market price of high-grade Keemun tea is over 100 yuan per market catty, and sometimes even reaches over 400 yuan. The price of mid-grade Keemun tea is 70 or 80 yuan, and even the price of low-grade Keemun tea must be 40 or 50 yuan. Not only do prices fluctuate annually, but they also vary at different times within a year, depending on supply and demand conditions and exchange rates. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e163">Cotton Yarn: Cotton Yarn Rises Again, Influenced by the Osaka Sampin Telegraph, While Yarn Sales Also Gradually Develop <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to be strong and bullish sentiment is rising again. This is largely due to the soaring prices of Osaka Sampin yarn, which have caused widespread anxiety. Japanese merchants are in a more bullish mood. Local merchants, due to year-end closures, mostly anticipated a slight pullback of ten yuan. Unexpectedly, news from the Japanese yarn market indicated a rising trend, which has influenced the Shanghai market.</p>
<p>The Further Out the Futures, the More Popular They Become</p>
<p>In the pre-market session for forward yarn, the one-month futures market was exceptionally quiet. Dachangcheng suddenly sold 1,000 bales, and also sold 1,000 bales for the two-month contract. When trading moved to the three-month contract, the Osaka Sampin telegraph arrived, showing a further increase of three to four yuan. Confidence was boosted, and Dachangcheng reversed course, buying over 1,000 bales in the three-month contract as a spread trade. The price surged by one and a half yuan. In the second round of trading, near-month contracts rose again, while long-term contracts remained strong. By the third closing, Sampin yarn had fallen back by 2.3 yuan. The one-month contract experienced a significant decline, but the longer-dated contracts remained firm. As a result, the one-month contract fell by one jiao compared to the previous day's close, while longer-dated contracts rose by four jiao to one yuan six jiao. In the afternoon session, trading reopened with Sampin yarn recovering its gains, and spot yarn transactions also amounted to over 900 bales. The trading floor tightened, and prices gradually rose. Consequently, all months rose again by one yuan six jiao to two yuan three to four jiao compared to the morning close. Sales included He Xing 1,550 bales, Jin Chang 900 bales, Ji Feng 850 bales, Ju Xing 750 bales, Zhen Da 650 bales, Shen Ji 1,050 bales, Da Chang Cheng 950 bales, Yi Chang 1,250 bales, Xie Cheng 800 bales, Ming De 1,850 bales, and Tai Chang 550 bales. Purchases included Yu Da 900 bales, Heng Yi 2,400 bales, Da Feng 1,950 bales, Tai Xing 2,150 bales, Geng Feng 1,500 bales, Feng Tai 700 bales, Sheng Yuan 550 bales, Chang Yu 500 bales, Yi Cheng 650 bales, and Da Chang 1,600 bales. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Weak at 1,000 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. A total of 963 bales were purchased by various groups throughout the day. The selling price of Japanese yarn remains strong and expensive, rising another two yuan. The purchase amounts for each group are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Foreign Cotton Stable: Spot Cotton Buying is Booming, Arrivals are Scarcer than Before, and Actual Sales are Improving <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is showing signs of a turnaround daily. Arrivals from various sources are not as plentiful as before. Firstly, there is news of rising prices in the Indian and American cotton markets overseas. Secondly, the price difference between yarn and cotton is too large. Generally, those holding inventory are more optimistic about the cotton market due to the stability of foreign cotton, and the cotton market is rising.</p>
<p>Futures Jump Six Jiao or So</p>
<p>In the pre-market session for spot cotton, all months uniformly rose. Due to the large increase in Indian cotton and news of increases in American cotton, buying interest was slightly higher. Japanese merchants also came to buy. The second round of trading was unchanged. By the closing, Osaka Sampin cotton had risen by seven, eight, and nine jiao, before falling back by six or seven jiao. Yu Da also sold in large quantities, and prices fell back slightly by one jiao. As a result, all months rose by two to three jiao compared to the previous day's close. In the afternoon session, Sampin cotton rose again, and the outlook for American cotton was bullish. At the same time, Japanese factories were actively buying spot cotton, boosting confidence further. Buying momentum was strong, and market conditions progressed steadily. As a result, all months rose again by three and a half to four jiao compared to the morning close. Sales included Yu Da 7,500 dan, Yuan Da 1,400 dan, Ming Hua 1,900 dan, Yuan Yi 2,500 dan, Xie Cheng 5,300 dan, Sheng Yuan 3,000 dan, Yong Da 1,800 dan, Yi Kang 4,900 dan, Tai Xing 2,600 dan, Chang Yu 2,500 dan, Yi Chang 5,100 dan, and Fu Kang 2,400 dan. Purchases included Chang Feng 13,600 dan, Geng Feng 5,800 dan, Sen Kang 1,400 dan, Feng Tai 4,200 dan, Da Chang 7,700 dan, Heng Yi 4,600 dan, Da Feng 4,300 dan, and Chang He 2,000 dan. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Japanese Factories Buy Cotton in Large Quantities</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is improving. Japanese factories are actively buying, and all transactions are in bulk. Sources include 1,100 bales of Yao cotton and 858 yuan of Tong cotton.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Sampin Yarn Long-Term Contracts Continue to Rise <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Osaka Telegraph, 28th: Sampin futures fell six jiao to rise two yuan seven jiao. Near-month at 262.1 yuan, long-term at 253.7 yuan. Cotton futures rose one and a half jiao to seven jiao. Recent at 71.95 yuan, long-term at 74.25 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Indian Cotton Demand Increased Last Week <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Exports to Japan were very strong last week. Due to the strength of Japanese yarn, the demand for Indian cotton has increased. The mainland is calm. Lancashire is still actively buying new Galatz cotton, and the period is booming. Although there is a large amount of short selling in the Bombay market, it has not been affected in the slightest because exporters are continuously buying to offset old debts.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Rises With the Yarn Market, High-End Plain Fuchow Silk Already Offered Yesterday, Dafeng Mingli Priced at 5.5 Jiao Per Yard <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market trend was still good. Sales of unbleached and colored fabrics have improved. Because foreign firms have been unable to ship goods for three days, people's hearts were stirred by the rising yarn market in Japan. Therefore, various new transactions suddenly became lively yesterday. The selling market was flat and weak in the morning. Local factory fine twill and heavy coarse cloth and coarse twill occasionally loosened (per piece) about one jiao. By the afternoon, with the spot yarn soaring even more fiercely, especially the faster months, the market gradually turned better. Dong Pi fine cloth and fine twill rose (per piece) by about 2.5 fen. Yihua Factory coarse cloth, coarse twill, fine cloth, and fine twill were all unchanged from the previous week's market price. More coarse cloth was transacted, totaling more than 700 bales, mostly purchased by local street and inland Hubei merchants. Jiangxi merchants bought more than 200 pieces of colored cloth and printed goods. Hunan merchants and various dyeing factories in this port bought more than 300 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill. Other small transactions in various places were also very active. Japanese merchants and foreign firms have opened up the leading brands of fine cloth for January and February goods, which is lower than the spot market price (per piece) by 1.5 jiao. High-end plain Fuchow silk is also available for sale. Dafeng Mingli brand is 5.5 jiao per yard, and Sixi brand is 4.8 jiao (per yard). According to reports, the spring selling price of Sixi was 4.12 jiao.</p>

<p>Yesterday's gold market turned downward as the situation was optimistic and public sentiment was greatly stabilized, with many parties closing their positions. However, a certain bank took advantage of the low price to vigorously cover, and then hovered, with the trend uncertain. In the early morning, overseas silver markets rose in both Britain and the United States during the closure period, with the forward silver price in Montreux unchanged, shrinking by five hao and rising by one li respectively. Exchange rates rose slightly. London spot gold rose by half a penny. The Central Bank's listing revealed that both Britain and the United States were flat, and the customs gold unit rose by two li. The standard spot gold price was listed as 1151 yuan, and the pre-market off-floor trading opened, falling back to within 58 yuan, which was due to General Chiang's return to Nanjing, greatly stabilizing public sentiment. However, there was a lack of maintenance, and major dealers Heng Yu, Fuxing, Yongda, and Decheng all sold, further dropping to about six yuan. The morning opened with a low, and after opening, major dealers continued to cut their long positions, suddenly seeing a fall. However, major shorts took advantage of the situation to vigorously cover, and it was still easy to pull up the price. The HSBC Bank listing revealed that both Britain and the United States were flat. At this time, supply and demand were balanced, and there was a major struggle. The silver equalization tax rose by one fen. After entering, a certain bank continued to vigorously cover, rising once. However, many parties also divested, and the afternoon market resumed fatigue. However, there was still a lot of maintenance after the low, and it repeatedly revolved. The day's market conditions are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1156 yuan, down 3.2 jiao from before the closure. Yuan Mao, Yong Fuxing, Shui Hengyu, Dacheng, Qiaofeng, and Dingkang all sold, retreating from 6.2 jiao to 3.8 jiao. Qiaofeng, Yong Yi, Taiyuan Mao, and Shui took advantage of the low to cover their positions, rising to 5.8 jiao.

The HSBC Bank listing revealed that although Britain and the United States were flat, it still retreated to 4.9 jiao. Chunyuan, Yong Dingkang, Qingfa, and Yong all advanced, and the silver equalization tax rose by one fen. A certain bank vigorously covered, rising to 5.7 jiao.

January logging was 1153 yuan, February was 1155 yuan, the morning top-up was 1152 yuan, and red gold was added 10 yuan to 1166 yuan. The spot market was greatly fatigued due to the stabilization of public sentiment. The selling price of red gold was added 18 yuan, and more than 200 taels were traded by silver shop groups, with a buying price of 14 yuan. Tianjin goods were added 14 yuan, but there were no transactions. The forward trend was even cheaper, and there were few opponents.</p>
<p>Trading on the floor was flat. In summary, Dingkang, Qingfa, Yong Qiaofeng, Yong Yuan Mao, Yong Da Changxiang, Chunyuan Yong, Yida Ju Da, and Shen Da Yong were on the buying side, while Da Decheng, Hengyu, Hengchang Yongchengda, Yu Xinxing Wanxing, Tong Feng Heng Run Chang, Yu Dafeng Heng Fuxing Yong, Tong Taichang Shengyuan Yong, etc. were on the selling side.

<h3 id="e169">Chinese Merchants are Selling Foreign Exchange En Masse, and British, American, and Japanese Exchange Rates are Greatly Easing <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the stabilization of the situation and public sentiment, the foreign exchange market was greatly eased as Chinese merchants cut their long positions. In the early morning, overseas telegraphs reported that London large strips recently rose to 1875, with long-term unchanged. The forward silver price in Montreux was unchanged, shrinking by five hao and rising by one li respectively. London spot gold rose by half a penny. British against American was unchanged, British against French rose three pounds. American against British rose 0.0625, and American against French shrunk 0.125. The Central Bank's listing revealed that Britain and the United States were flat, and the customs gold unit rose by two li. The morning opening of the exchange market saw the recent selling price of British exchange at 1 shilling 2 pence 4375, and American exchange at 29.5625 yuan, slightly harder than before the closure for both British and American exchanges. Unexpectedly, public sentiment was not good, and Chinese merchants intentionally sold off. The market hardened immediately after opening, and banks also supplied. The HSBC Bank listing revealed that Britain and the United States were flat, and although the silver equalization tax rose by one fen, it was still difficult to support. There were rumors of inflation in Japan, and the eastern exchange also greatly eased accordingly. Later, banks took advantage of the cheap prices to maintain the market, and it turned slightly peaceful. In the afternoon market, Chinese merchants continued to liquidate, and the situation was still difficult to revitalize. Banks were still scooping up at cheap prices, and it was also difficult to harden again. The overall trend struggled. By the close, the recent selling price of British exchange was 1 shilling 2 pence 53125, and American exchange was 29.75 yuan. Compared to before the closure, British eased 125 and American hardened 21875. Long-term, British eased 109375 and American hardened 3125. Chinese merchants vigorously sold both British and American exchanges, and sold nearly 2 million yuan of Japanese exchange. The day's transactions are recorded below.</p>

<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, the price of public bonds futures for February began to be traded. Due to the resolution of the Xi'an Incident, the morale of the market was even more enthusiastic under the clarification of the situation. The purchasing power of major dealers was extremely solid, and there was a shortage of chips in the market. Prices gradually advanced, and the bullish sentiment was very strong. The one-month unified public bond futures were close to the highest price, and Class A public bonds repeatedly hit record highs, reaching a new peak of 74.75 yuan. Due to the dividend ex-date, the two-month futures were about 2.5 yuan lower than the recent futures. However, due to the booming market sentiment, they also trended strongly. Arbitrage trading was extremely active. Today is the delivery date for December futures, and trading is suspended for one day as usual. The opening situation in the morning was good, and sentiment was quite active. Major dealers such as numbers 35, 44, and 5 absorbed large quantities, and chips were depleted. Prices rose uniformly by 3.5 to 5.5 jiao. However, numbers 31 and 45 sold quite a bit. The trend in the second round of trading became more elegant. Due to favorable rumors, buying appetite became even stronger. Numbers 47, 4, and 71 continued to buy, very enthusiastically. Numbers 72 and 22 gradually emerged, and prices continued to rise by 2.3 to 4 jiao. The opening in the afternoon saw even more intense gains. Numbers 11, 47, and 10 continued to add to their long positions, and the sentiment among retail investors also turned elegant, and they bought more. Numbers 54 and 43 sold quite a bit. Prices improved by another 1.5 to 4 jiao. At the close, Class E and Class D rose by another 1 or 2 jiao. However, when Class D long-term futures opened, numbers 51 and 35 eagerly sold, and prices gradually fell back by 5 fen to 3 jiao. Numbers 11, 10, and 16 still bought more, so the trend was also very elegant. The full-day result was that January futures all rose by 8 jiao to 1.2 yuan. February futures were newly opened. The total number of transactions was 16.72 million yuan. A comparison of the rises, falls, highs, and lows is listed in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 30 sources from various groups in Hexia, and the stacking households of white japonica rice on the market continued to move. Scattered store sales also continued. Prices rose by 1 to 2 jiao. Early rice followed the rise by a few jiao. The Yanjin group continued to purchase thin rice, and this street also moved it, with prices increasing by more than a jiao. Yangdubu customers continued to sell retail rice, with prices increasing by a few fen. White yuan rice moved quite actively, with prices increasing by about 2 jiao. The prices of other goods all increased by nearly a jiao, and Yin Yuan was firm.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various groups were the same as before, with a total of more than 70 sources and a total of 14,700 to 800 shi of goods, including more than 40 sources of thin rice. The sales market in this street was still active, and buns also sold well. It is estimated that the Pingjin Qingyan and other groups purchased more than 5,000 packages of thin rice and more than 2,000 packages of thick japonica rice, so the situation was still tight and the market continued to be elegant. Thin rice prices increased by one jiao, and thick japonica rice also improved by a few fen to a jiao. Looking at the market trend, the Lunar New Year is approaching. If the sources are limited, the sales of buns may be slightly smoother. However, since the price is already high, the rise in the future is particularly difficult. For the time being, it may return to a state of hovering. The supply and demand of Duyangjian and Yin Yuan are the same, and there is still no honor or disgrace.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the foreign silk market, Yokohama's surge was particularly fierce. It is estimated that spot goods sold for 910 yuan, up 30 yuan, and futures also sold for 910 yuan, up about 50 yuan. According to rumors in this city, it is said that Japan will implement inflation, hence the surge. Yesterday, New York had no market. Due to the sudden rise in Japanese silk, public sentiment in Shanghai tended to be strong and good. Users and foreign firms each made transactions. Silk merchants and white factories' holding price of 78 yuan per degree has risen to 800 yuan. Sales of Black Flying Horse grades of domestic silk opened at 750 yuan, up about 30 yuan from last week. A total of 226 packages were sold yesterday, such as Xinfu advancing Xueshan 10 packages at a price of 805 yuan. According to this transaction, it was the telegram sent on the 24th, and the transaction was made yesterday, so it seemed cheaper.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Russia Will Increase Purchases of Chinese Tea Quantities <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The trade in Chinese tea with Russia has plummeted in recent years. The reason for this is actually the dumping of Japanese Indian and Sri Lankan teas. Japanese and Indian tea leaves, sold to Russia, are priced lower than Chinese tea and transaction procedures can be paid on credit. As a result, Chinese tea has no way to compete. Now I heard that the Russian Chamber of Commerce believes that the Japanese and Indian teas purchased in recent years have failed to meet the tastes of the Russian people and sales are difficult. It is difficult to sell well unless mixed with Chinese tea. After discussions, it was decided to increase purchases by 40% of the original amount in light of market prices. According to general business observations, the sales of green tea in the future may improve.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Metals: High Price of Pig Lead, Slow Actual Sales. Overseas Prices Have Pulled Back Slightly More Than Ten Shillings <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Since the price of pig lead has been increased, the market in this port has also risen accordingly. However, actual sales have become slow due to the high selling price. In fact, it is difficult for users to calculate the costs, and many are watching and not acting. Yesterday, the market price for foreign lead was 32.5 yuan, local lead was 30 yuan, and mixed lead was 289 yuan. The overseas price was reported yesterday at 27 pounds and 10 shillings, which is a pullback of slightly more than ten shillings compared to before. The market traded 4500 bars yesterday, purchased by various groups in Jiujiang, Anqing, and Fujian. Factories on this street only inquired and did not trade.</p>

<p>Recently, the Sichuan goods source of black fungus has been scarce, and the market price in Hankou has also been firm, so the trend has become tight.

<h3 id="e178">Silk Floss of Huzhou <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— (Yan Bophoto)</p>
<p>The giant wheel of time has turned to the severe winter season, and everyone is preparing to rush to make winter clothes. People in Huzhou are very common to use silk floss as a wonderful product to keep out the cold, such as silk floss padded jackets and trousers; silk floss vests, silk floss robes, silk floss quilts... It is a pity that silk floss quilts, to be serviceable, must be added to and re-made every year so as not to lose their beauty and efficacy.</p>
<p>Every year when the oranges are green and the oranges are yellow, many old ladies put red strips on their doorsteps, specializing in making silk floss clothes for people. The daily wage is about two to half a yuan, plus board. In Suzhou, Shanghai and other places, the old women charge one, two or three yuan for remaking a silk floss robe, and the old women in Huzhou are quicker and neater. Therefore, this industry is a specialized skill, and even modern ladies who are born in Huzhou rarely do well.</p>
<p>Silk floss clothing is warm and light to wear, and it can also protect against bullets. If you wear silk floss padded jackets and trousers and silk floss robes at the same time, if a stray bullet comes from afar, it can indeed only penetrate into the silk floss and not touch the body. It is said that this is due to the spinning force of the bullet.</p>
<p>The soldiers of the Sui Army are fighting bravely and hard in the icy and snowy weather. The best thing to raise and send for rear support is silk floss vests, which have strong resistance to the cold. However, avoid padded jackets and trousers, because when padded jackets and trousers are worn, once you exercise, their heat is even stronger, and after a long time, they will eventually make you unable to move. This is because it contains the effect of clinging to power!</p>
<h3 id="e179">Camels in Peiping <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Haizhu</p>
<p>It is deep autumn. A maple leaf is like a red heart, blooming in the vast autumn fields, autumn in Peiping!</p>
<p>"...Unexpectedly, it is autumn again this time. Three years ago today, when you went out to see the camels in the cold wind, you were not afraid of the cold. You would run all the way to Zhengyangmen. Now the camels in Peiping have grown hair. How interesting!" Lan's letter said.</p>
<p>The camels have grown hair, and the autumn wind brings coldness. It is always like this in Peiping.</p>
<p>Since the autumn wind blew down the leaves and brought a bit of coldness, I have thought of the camels in Peiping. Although the camels in Peiping are not beautiful, their perseverance and honesty have their own loveliness. When I first arrived in Peiping, I didn't like the frost and fallen leaves in autumn, I wasn't used to listening to the bugle calls in the evening, or the train wailing in the morning mist. But I especially liked to watch the interesting camels under Zhengyangmen. At this time, such a team of camels, walking, with their long legs, moving in a staccato rhythm, their long necks, nodding bit by bit, and their high humps, swaying back and forth, paced through Zhengyangmen. The cameleers, pulling the ropes in front, were not noisy, not anxious, and accompanied the camels step by step.</p>
<p>It is deep autumn, and needless to say, I have a good feeling for Peiping, even the camels. The camels coming and going in the wind and sand, I have written many articles praising camels in the past three years, and have said many words of love for camels to others.</p>
<p>Now the autumn is getting deeper day by day, and the camels in Peiping must have grown their hair long ago. Because Peiping has those interesting camels, I am starting to express my love for them. ...On a autumn morning, stepping on the sandy ground and letting the slightly cold autumn wind blow on my body, I am also patiently counting the slow steps of the camels.</p>
<p>"Is it still so cold, are you still going to see the camels?" Lan often said to me with a smile. I nodded and left, and only after the sun set, in the evening in front of Zhengyangmen when it was slightly cold, would I go back alone...</p>
<p>The autumn is already very deep, and the camels in Peiping may have grown a lot of hair, but when can I go to Peiping?</p>
<h3 id="e180">The Beggars of Tibet <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Ye</p>
<p>To be a beggar and consider it a golden rice bowl, it can be said that this is only found in Tibet. Because in Tibet, to be a beggar, if there is no generational inheritance, it is not possible, except for the disabled. There are many Buddhist temples in Tibet, and Buddha is the most worshipped by Tibetans, so there are many people who give alms, and the income of beggars is not bad. Therefore, being a beggar is considered a golden rice bowl passed down from generation to generation, and there are many people in Tibet who rely on this for a living.</p>
<p>However, there is a custom that beggars cannot scold people, because people generally believe that being scolded by a beggar is unlucky. Therefore, when a beggar asks for alms, if the benefactor tells him that they have already given, he can only hang his head and leave. However, beggars have their own techniques for begging. For example, whenever they ask for alms, they try their best to flatter the benefactor or stick up their thumbs to show the benefactor's nobility. In this way, those benefactors with vanity are happy to give them some money.</p>
<p>Tibetan beggars are also divided into two types: Qin beggars and Skill beggars. Qin beggars ask for alms by playing a four-stringed lute and usually bring children to dance for fun. However, the tunes they play on their four-stringed lutes are all mournful and touching, so people are generally moved and give alms. As for Skill beggars, they usually carry several snakes and perform various snake tricks in front of the benefactor. Some people also bring other animals and use various skills to please the benefactor and obtain money for alms.</p>
<p>There are two reasons why begging in Tibet has become a hereditary profession. One is due to the training of skills and lute techniques, which are difficult for others to learn. The other is due to habit, because it is passed down from generation to generation, and the benefactors also recognize that someone is the descendant of someone, so they are happy to give alms. If you are not disabled and want to be a beggar in Tibet, you will not see a benefactor give you money all year round. With these two reasons, the descendants of beggars mostly inherit the profession of their ancestors, because it is a golden rice bowl and easier to do than other things, so why not do it? However, these beggars are all social parasites, lazy pigs who do not engage in production.</p>

<p>If he wanted something from me for himself, but our relatives have always been distant. He wouldn't suddenly have something to ask for at this time. Even if he did, it would probably be trivial matters like moving money and objects, nothing serious. He'd just go to the old lady. But he's here, and he doesn't say what he wants. He hesitates, and I can't figure out what he means. Therefore, Guoqi feels more embarrassed sitting in this room than being trapped in a besieged city. He doesn't know what to say to resolve the difficulty. Just as he's struggling, Aunt Liu brings in an express letter, asking him to stamp it. He finally has a chance to cover up his awkwardness and turns away to read the letter. Youmei smiles: "Should I leave?" Guoqi smiles: "Oh! It's nothing, just a letter from the Shanghai Bookstore urging me to submit manuscripts." Youmei sits quietly on the side, waiting for him to finish reading the letter. Then she smiles: "Cousin, since Shanghai has so many places that need you to write articles, why don't you go to Shanghai to live?" Guoqi says: "I think I still need to study a little more. Shanghai is not a place to read books." Youmei says: "Cousin, Shanghai sent an express letter urging you to submit manuscripts. They must be waiting for them. Do they want essays? Or novels?" Guoqi says: "They want both essays and novels." Youmei says: "If they send a letter, just write. Doesn't Cousin feel that the village is lacking in material?" Guoqi says: "Novels are something I imagine myself, so it's nothing. Essays need to move facts onto the paper, so sometimes I do feel it's difficult." Youmei says: "My family has many letters from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era. People say that if they were organized, they would make good essays. Does Cousin need that kind of material?" Guoqi says: "That's the most fashionable writing now, so how could I not need it?" Youmei smiles: "Since that's the case, I'll help Cousin. Tomorrow, I'll sort out these materials and send them to Cousin, okay?" Guoqi smiles: "That would be great. I wouldn't dare to steal someone else's credit. I'll make a note on the manuscript that the material was provided by Miss Li Youmei." Youmei smiles: "I don't care about that..." This is an unfinished sentence. Below, she should explain what she does care about. But she only says half of this sentence, smiles slightly, and ends the conversation. Guoqi fans himself with his folding fan and looks at her. She tugs at her clothes and adjusts her temples, feeling that there's nothing to explain, so she gets up to say goodbye. Her visit really gives Guoqi an indescribable feeling. Is it intentional, or unintentional? Or is there something to discuss? Or is there nothing to discuss? (116)</p>

<p>— (Jiao Shijie)</p>
<p>In order to satisfy some "spiritual food," I go to the public reading room every day. But the situation has changed in the past few days. The reading room is always overcrowded. At first, seeing it for a day or two was not surprising, but such a situation for several days made me curious. After thinking about it, I suddenly realized that this phenomenon occurred after the suppression of bandits in Suiyuan and the Xi'an Incident. This is not that everyone is抢to take away my "food," but it fully symbolizes the public's concern for national affairs and the hope for the revival of the Chinese nation. I was overjoyed and wrote this to record the current events.</p>
<p>Brief News: Xu Zhao from Jiangdu, courtesy name Weibai, is proficient in the six methods of painting and deeply understands the legacy of the ancients. His students are all outstanding talents of the time. Starting the day before yesterday, the Daxin Company is exhibiting his and his students' works, totaling more than 200 pieces, carefully selected and exquisitely crafted, magnificent and elegant. In two days, nearly a thousand people have visited. It is said that after the closing, they will go on a tour exhibition in various places.</p>
<h3 id="e184">The Oranges of Wenzhou <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Bailing</p>
<p>Oranges are originally tropical plants, but today they are also widely grown in temperate zones. They are afraid of the cold winter, so gardeners cover them with dog manure and river mud - but pig manure will kill them, and they are prone to pests. Covering them with sulfur powder will prevent this.</p>
<p>The orange tree is an evergreen shrub, and it is lovely even in winter. Therefore, Zhang Jiuling wrote in his poem: "In Jiangnan, there are red oranges, evergreen forests throughout the winter. Is it because the climate is warm, or does it have a steadfast heart in the cold winter?" The trunk is one or two zhang tall, with small thorns on the stems. The leaves are pinnate, and the petioles have wing-like leaflets. In early summer, it blooms with small white flowers with five petals. In early winter, the fruits ripen, flattened and round, yellow or red in color, with thin skin that is easy to peel, and a slightly sweet and sour taste. Tang Lu Guimeng has a poem praising it, saying: "Fine jade has juice, must yield in taste, bright pearls are unique, also ashamed of roundness," the words are accurate.</p>
<p>At the beginning of winter, the oranges are ripe, with round fruits and red color, which contrast with the green branches and leaves, making them most lovely. Ming Qian Sheng once wrote: "Dense golden balls can't help but be stolen, most pity them hanging on the treetops. The old man's mouth and stomach have no share, leaving them for the eyes in late autumn." He can be said to be a good connoisseur.</p>
<p>However, the function of oranges is not in appreciation, but in providing food. Silver plate red fruits, the flavor is both rich and the sweet pulp and juice are especially good for digestion. The best ones are used to entertain guests, and the inferior ones are made into orange cakes. The brine can be used to make wine, spices, or fruit syrup. The skin and pulp can be used in medicine, with nothing wasted.</p>
<p>Guangdong, Fuzhou, and Wenzhou in our country are all famous for producing oranges, and I know more about Wenzhou oranges. According to the Qunfang Pu, oranges come from Taizhou, Suzhou, west from Jingzhou, south from Min and Guang Fuzhou, but none are better than Wenzhou. It can be said to be highly praised.</p>
<p>The migration of the orange production area in Wenzhou is recorded in Lao Da's Oujiang Yizhi: "The soil of Yongjia is suitable for planting oranges. Han Shouyan Zhi's records can prove this. In the Song Dynasty, they were produced in Xishan, and Ye Zhengze's poem 'There are forests of orange trees' is also true. Later, they flourished in Hetian of Taoshan, then Shanggang, then Nan Xianyang, and gradually to Wutian. The migration of the earth's qi is from northwest to southeast."</p>
<p>There are many varieties of Wenzhou oranges. Han Yanzhi's Orange Record says: "Produced in Wenzhou, there are fourteen varieties: Huangju (Yellow Orange), Taju (Collapsed Orange), Baoju (Bag Orange), Mianju (Cotton Orange), Shaju (Sand Orange), Lizhiju (Lychee Orange), Ruan Tiaoyaju (Soft Branch Bud Orange), Youju (Oil Orange), Luju (Green Orange), Jinju (Golden Orange), Ruju (Milk Orange), Ziranju (Natural Orange), Zao Huangju (Early Yellow Orange), Dongju (Frozen Orange)." According to the Tongzhi: "The oranges of Dongjia are similar to those of Zhejiang West. Their taste is sweet and delicious, and those without seeds are the best. The Ruju mentioned in the Guangyu Ji is this."</p>
<p>Han Yanzhi was a Song Dynasty person who knew Wenzhou and wrote the Orange Record in three volumes. The upper volume describes citrus products, one orange product, the middle volume describes eighteen orange products, and the lower volume describes planting methods. I have not seen the Orange Record, so I know it but not in detail, but I learned from a friend: "The best oranges are of three kinds: first, Wenzhou is the honey orange, which is the best variety, large and slightly flat, the outer skin is dark red, yellow, the skin is easily separated from the pulp, the segments are about ten, fragrant, sweet and delicious, ripening at the end of October, and can be stored for a long time. The second is the red honey orange, the fruit is round and flat, with only traces of the navel, slightly concave around, and the pedicel is raised. The peel is smooth and yellowish-red. The third is the bag orange, the fruit is small, flattened and round, with a raised pedicel and a slightly low and flat fruit pit. The outer skin is yellow, and there are about six to ten segments. It is produced in Dongting, Jiangsu Province, hence it is also known as Dongting Red.</p>
<p>In the past, Ye Shi had a poem about orange branches: "Honey orange segments have a golden skin, short days hang sparsely in people's homes. Judgmental frost cuts through the dew to load the boat, not singing Yangzhi, but singing orange branches." From this, we can know the prosperity of the orange industry in Wenzhou. All guests who come to Wenzhou must first taste honey oranges for pleasure.</p>
<h3 id="e185">The Snakes of Guangdong <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Nangong Sheng</p>
<p>Snakes are poisonous animals. Although some are not poisonous, there are more poisonous ones, such as the Red-banded krait, the Banded krait, and the Grey snake, all of which are highly venomous. Only a few kinds like the green snake are non-poisonous. Generally speaking, poisonous snakes have triangular heads, while non-poisonous snakes have flat, round heads.</p>
<p>There are the most poisonous snakes in tropical regions, and there are very strange poisonous snakes. For example, India produces two-headed snakes and human-faced snakes, whose venom is unparalleled. A few years ago, these two kinds of strange snakes were displayed in the Shanghai Great World. According to the snake owner, an Indian, 300,000 Indians die from these two kinds of snake venom every year in India. This is such an amazing number!</p>
<p>The largest snakes are pythons, which can be twenty or thirty zhang long and as thick as round barrels. They are produced in large quantities in Africa, Annam, and other places. The natives regard pythons as delicious food. After catching them, they are cooked and used to entertain guests. This is because the snake's venom is all in the head. As long as the head is discarded, there is no venom, and it is a very delicious food.</p>
<p>Guangdong Province in our country is a place where snakes are considered a delicacy. In recent years, it has gradually become popular in Shanghai. In winter, Guangdong restaurants in Shanghai use eating snakes as a selling point. Besides people from Guangdong and Guangxi, there are quite a few people who like to eat snakes. Therefore, the trend of eating snakes has gradually become widespread. According to Guangdong people who are good at eating snakes, snake meat is not only delicious, but also has the effect of dispelling wind, cold, promoting blood circulation, strengthening the body, and treating skin diseases. Therefore, it is a must-eat every winter. The number of snakes eaten every year is considerable.</p>
<p>Guangdong people are very particular about eating snakes. There are two kinds of snakes that they eat: one is a large snake, which is called the Golden Leopard because it has money-like spots on its body. The large ones weigh seventy or eighty catties. We often see the sign "Today we will butcher a Golden Leopard" at the entrance of Guangdong restaurants. The other is a small snake, which must be cooked with three kinds of snakes, called Three-Snake Stew. However, the effect is not as great as that of the Golden Leopard.</p>
<p>Snake meat has three names. When cooked with chicken, it is called the "Dragon and Phoenix Meeting." When cooked with civet cat, it is called the "Dragon and Tiger Meeting." There is also a kind that is pure snake meat, called the "Three-Snake Stew."</p>
<p>Snake bones are poisonous, so after killing the snake, the bones must be removed completely. Otherwise, the poison will be passed on to the people who eat the snake. It is said that the death of Zhu Zhaoxin, a negotiator between Guangdong and Guangxi in the past, was due to eating snake bones. Snake bile is also regarded as a precious thing, because it has the effect of improving eyesight and dispelling wind and dampness. The best is the "Cinnabar Bile," which comes with a cinnabar bag. Usually, snake bile is eaten by drinking snake bile wine, which is made by dripping bile juice into undiluted sorghum wine. One drop of bile juice in one cup of undiluted sorghum wine turns the wine green, which is beneficial to the human body. However, it is very difficult to extract the bile. If you are not careful, it will break. This all depends on the skill of the snake killer. In Guangzhou, famous snake-killing chefs become the center of attention in winter, because wealthy families have to eat snakes and have to ask him to kill them. The price they get each month is often around several hundred yuan. The way Guangdong people eat snakes can be imagined.</p>
<p>In Guangzhou, there is also a trend of eating snake bile exclusively. Seven or eight people gather and go to the snake shops outside the city that specialize in selling snake bile to eat snake bile in a big way. This kind of snake is a small snake, and the snake bile is very small. Each person has to eat five or six, and seven or eight people need thirty or forty snake lives. Moreover, they want the most alive and most agile snakes. The people who extract the snake bile have developed the skill to know where the snake bile is. They use their hands to dig out the entire bile from the live snake. Isn't this too cruel!</p>

<h3 id="e186">Seeking Medicine vs. Seeking Medical Care <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>Chinese people have a very bad habit when it comes to dealing with illnesses, which is that when they have a problem, they only want to seek medicine and are unwilling to seek medical care. This kind of behavior of seeking medicine and not seeking medical care has harmed the bodies of many patients and lost the lives of many people!</p>
<p>In their minds, they think that going to consult a doctor when they are sick is only to ask the doctor to prescribe a prescription and get some medicine to take. If there is a simple way to skip the step of consulting a doctor and directly get the medicine, wouldn't that be the same as achieving the goal? The purpose of taking medicine can also be achieved in the same way, but it saves two extra steps: it can save the doctor's time for examination and also save a consultation fee when consulting a doctor. Isn't this a win-win situation?</p>
<p>With this kind of mentality of being afraid of trouble, saving procedures, being greedy for petty gains, and taking shortcuts, once they have a problem, they are unwilling to go to a doctor properly, but instead find medicine to take randomly. So, for headaches, they take "aspirin," headache medicine; for stomachaches, they take morphine, stomachache powder; by extension, for mental weakness, they take brain tonics, and for blood deficiency, they take blood tonics. They don't know that a headache is just a symptom of a disease, not the disease itself; there are various complex reasons for headaches, and aspirin alone cannot solve all headaches. Of course, there are headaches that are cured by taking aspirin, but there are also headaches that are made worse by taking aspirin. Stomachaches are also just a common symptom of many things. Morphine can temporarily stop a stomachache, but it may not cure all the diseases that cause stomachaches! Also, mental weakness is a self-reported symptom by the patient. Is it really mental weakness? That is still a question. Blood deficiency is also the patient's own imagination. Is it really blood deficiency? That cannot be determined either. Moreover, what is the root cause of mental weakness? What is the cause of blood deficiency? If you don't first understand the root cause of mental weakness and blood deficiency and then take medicine randomly, how can you expect the medicine to cure the disease? But understanding the reasons for mental weakness, blood deficiency, headaches, and stomachaches requires a doctor's examination.</p>
<p>The patient's desire in seeking medical care seems to be only to take medicine, and the purpose of taking medicine is of course to cure the disease. But you must know that without first seeking medical diagnosis, you cannot understand the root cause of the problem. Without understanding the details of the illness and taking medicine randomly, not only will there be no guarantee of curing the disease, but it will often lead to accidents, messes, and endanger life!</p>
<p>Curing the disease is of course the doctor's responsibility, but identifying the disease is even more the doctor's skill. Taking medicine is a tool for curing the disease, but sometimes there are many other methods for curing the disease besides taking medicine. If you encounter diseases that do not require taking medicine to cure, and you take medicine randomly, wouldn't you be harming yourself instead of benefiting? Whether to use medicine to cure the disease or use other methods to treat the disease can only be decided by a doctor who can identify the disease in order to avoid this kind of unexpected harm! Only then can you achieve the effect of the medicine curing the disease!</p>
<h3 id="e187">Prospects for Medical and Health Undertakings in the 26th Year <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Ziliang</p>
<p>The New Year of the 26th year is just a few days away! We are pleased that our public health guide, the "Medical and Pharmaceutical Special Issue," will add a glorious year to its history amidst the gratitude and anticipation of the masses. However, we cannot be satisfied with this or consider this the end goal. As each year passes, the responsibilities we bear increase rather than decrease. At the same time, the public's expectations for this publication, as seen in their words, show a desire for increased contributions from this publication, with particularly high expectations. Similarly, other medical and pharmaceutical facilities and health initiatives naturally increase their effectiveness and achievements with each passing year. This pattern repeats itself year after year, but why is it being mentioned specifically this year? It is because the rapid development of health undertakings, the opening and expansion of health defenses, especially in the past year or two, including this year, have yielded unexpectedly significant results. Taking the facts before us, the successful preparation for the National Health Education Annual Conference, the Nanchang Leprosy Hospital, and the Zhongzheng Medical College have all been established or are in progress this year. There are many other achievements as well, so the backbone of medical and health undertakings this year has become increasingly solid. At the same time, the era of medical and health undertakings transforming from embryonic to formed is upon us.</p>
<p>At this eve of the upcoming 26th year, at this moment of transition between old and new endeavors, at the beginning of the medical community's two-year work cycle, how can we not reflect on our past mistakes and formulate future directions? Moreover, the solidity of the foundation is a prediction of the success or failure of our profession. The success or failure of our undertakings and the interests of the nation are naturally closely linked. Therefore, medical and health undertakings in the 26th year, under the aforementioned circumstances, occupy a crucial position where success or failure hinges on this single move. Now, with utmost sincerity, I wish all medical and pharmaceutical personnel to thoroughly reform our work with twelvefold effort, sweep away all obstacles in our path, and shoulder the great mission of maintaining the life of our entire nation and enriching the strength of the nation and people. I also hope for the following:</p>
<p>(1) Unify the System and Rectify the Internal Structure: Strengthen internal organization and unite various health agencies so that they can operate under the same governing body, pursuing agreed-upon policies with collaborative goals. Our country lacks the aforementioned unity. There are even unqualified individuals filling positions in health administration, performing duties beyond their capabilities, which often leads to inefficiency. Sometimes the division of powers is unclear, and directives from higher authorities are not implemented on time, or are even overtly disobeyed. These are all manifestations of an unsound internal organization, which affects the progress of the entire undertaking. As for the various health agencies, such as those run by the national government, provincial governments, county governments, and private organizations, they maintain extremely defined boundaries and lack a unified system due to limited authority. Each fulfills its own duties, taking a wait-and-see attitude, which greatly hinders the progress of health undertakings. Therefore, all national health agencies should abandon the above concepts and take mutual assistance, research, advocacy, and obedience to the instructions of any senior health agency as their duty. At the same time, the government should control all health agencies, especially in this era of national crisis, and strive to avoid a scattered mindset and organization.</p>
<p>(2) Organize Aviation Rescue: In today's rapidly changing world situation, with the East Asian crisis imminent, we can no longer afford to wait and see. Rescue work is a major task in wartime. However, human rescue is time-consuming and laborious, and often fails to achieve the purpose of rescue. For example, fierce battles at the front may last for months, and the number of wounded in those months cannot be accommodated by the temporary hospitals or the few existing hospitals at the front. If they are transferred to the rear, transportation will inevitably be congested during wartime, or there may be no means of transportation in remote areas. Under such circumstances, the lives of the wounded on the battlefield are in grave danger and cannot withstand repeated transfers. Even if the front hospitals can accommodate them, the lightly wounded may be saved, but the seriously wounded in the battlefield may not receive the meticulous and dedicated care of the doctors. If we put ourselves in the position of the wounded at that time, although many are difficult to save, those who can be saved are also difficult to survive. Therefore, to achieve rapid and effective rescue, we must utilize the power of aircraft. Amidst the call for aviation to save the nation, our national medical and pharmaceutical community should vigorously promote the work of donating funds to purchase rescue aircraft. The government should also pay attention to the lives of the wounded in wartime, quickly add equipment within its means, and organize the training of aviation rescue personnel. Alternatively, it could take advantage of the opportunity of transport planes returning empty from the front to accommodate some of the wounded and transport them to the rear. In the future, if several rescue work teams can be realized, not only will the effectiveness be enormous, but the number of rescued wounded who can regain their lives will be dozens of times greater than the work of several hospitals and rescue personnel at the front!</p>
<p>(3) Correct the Distorted Development of Medical and Health Undertakings: If one examines the country with a discerning eye, the following conclusion can be drawn: In major cities, medical and health undertakings such as hospitals, clinics, health centers, and epidemic prevention stations are so complete and developed that anyone can enjoy health and treatment, and the opportunities are gradually increasing. However, if you shift your gaze to other places, it is not the same. In many neglected counties within relatively developed provinces, one can still see scattered clinics, one or two incomplete and religious hospitals, or many unqualified doctors residing there, engaging in business. When someone seeks treatment, they are seen as a rare commodity, and exorbitant prices are charged. As a result, the poor never dare to inquire. In the end, such situations are truly countless. Other remote counties in border provinces simply do not have even a shadow of these things, let alone any health undertakings. Perhaps there are exceptions, but they are very rare! As for the villages attached to the cities, they enjoy favorable treatment. For example, Zhenjiang, as the provincial capital of Jiangsu Province, and the villages under the jurisdiction of Zhenjiang County, are therefore unexpectedly fortunate. Almost all the seven districts in the countryside have three or four provincial-run health experiment zones, and each district has a district health center, as well as health stations, maternity hospitals, clinics, and so on. Moreover, the agencies and scales contained in the health experiment sites are very large. Although this distorted development is due to the needs of dense urban populations, we must also pay attention to places outside of cities, so that all parts of the country, whether remote villages or secluded counties, can receive the baptism of non-profit new medicine and achieve the simultaneous and balanced development of medical and health undertakings in various places.</p>
<p>(4) Correct Nurses' Mentality and Restrict Unqualified Personnel from Parasitizing the New Medical Field: Nursing ethics have always been emphasized by the medical communities of all countries in the world, and their importance is self-evident. However, the general impression of hospitals in our country is unsatisfactory. This cannot be said to be due to inadequate training, but it is entirely a psychological effect. Look at the nurses in the first and second class wards of each hospital. They treat patients with great courtesy and are very serious in their care and all other work. But in the ordinary wards or people's hospitals, it is completely different. They frown and show a look of disgust towards the patients. If a patient asks a question, they scold them as if they are a nuisance. There are many, many such facts, or even worse. Therefore, the impact on the patient is great, and the reputation of the medical community also suffers considerable losses. Generally, people retain a fondness for the rich and a dislike for the poor from a young age, and this psychology is not easily changed. Therefore, when serving in society, it manifests itself at all times and in all places. I believe that this situation is particularly shameful when it occurs in the medical field. To reform this bad phenomenon, we must fundamentally treat it, that is, we must find ways to correct the psychology during the initial nurse training period. As for unqualified personnel parasitizing the medical field, they are everywhere, especially those heinous quacks. They rely entirely on their glib tongues to solicit customers, talking eloquently and engaging in deceptive monetary practices. If they perform surgery on the sick, it is even more dangerous. Speaking of the mixing of unqualified personnel, it is also very annoying, because they often make many unexpected mistakes, and thus the reputation of the new medical community often suffers unexpected blows from them. Therefore, in the future, we will not only eliminate quacks, but also restrict unqualified medical personnel who directly affect our reputation.</p>

<p>(5) Seek to Expand the Sources of Funding for Medical and Health Undertakings: To expand medical and health undertakings, there must be great economic strength. However, our country has a limited economic capacity. Therefore, to expand medical and health undertakings, we must seek other methods. Moreover, our country's understanding of new medical and health undertakings is very simple. As for private donations to establish medical undertakings, they are also limited. Therefore, the government should also add appropriate edification to public education to make the people of the whole country know its importance, know that it cannot be lacking. At the same time, local health authorities must also find ways to publicize the great righteousness, so that the people can voluntarily donate money that is wasted on useless things, such as superstitious consumption of tobacco and alcohol, and designate certain local banks or agency stores to collect donations on a regular basis so that people can donate at any time. If this can be done, there will definitely be good results in donations every year and everywhere. If this is used to expand health and medical undertakings, the value obtained will be immeasurable.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Prevention of Infant Colds and Attention in the Home <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Medical Doctor Gotoshima Hiroshi, Translated by Li Shouzhen</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, December has arrived and winter is here once more. At this time of year, colds are common and widespread. Families with beloved children, especially during this busy time of year and the approach of the happy new year, must be particularly attentive to the evil winds, which are the source of all illnesses, and not neglect them even for a moment. Therefore, we have invited Mr. Gotoshima (Vice-Director of the Mitsuwa Enjudo Hospital), from the perspective of a pediatrician, to give instructions as a reference for the home.</p>
<p>As the weather grows colder day by day, diseases of the respiratory system are increasing, especially the common cold. It is most often spread from adults to children, and from one person to the whole family, like a family infection. Fortunately, serious cases are rare. After contracting the illness, the fever is initially around 39 degrees Celsius, and many people cannot sleep well at night because of the cough. When this becomes severe, it becomes catarrhal pneumonia: the fever lasts from one week to two weeks. In the case of an epidemic, it goes without saying that absolute prevention is very difficult, but it is very important to pay attention at home for mild cases. That said, it is of course necessary to seek medical attention promptly if a child who is usually healthy contracts the illness, but it is absolutely unacceptable to assume that the child is healthy and pay no attention to it. It is not uncommon for children to go to school casually with a cough, only to become overwhelmed when the illness worsens. Therefore, even with mild cold symptoms, even if the child is very strong, it is important to make sure that he or she does not go out for a few days, and it is best to postpone bathing, etc. It is common to have a slight sore throat, a fever that lasts for a week, and an inability to sleep at night. In this way, nephritis can also occur. It is not uncommon for the strongest children to shout, "It's cold, it's cold," when their faces are already swollen, which is a clear sign of nephritis. Two brothers have both contracted it, and it is not uncommon for the disease to become incurable due to lack of attention. In this way, even if the child is weak, if you pay attention to him or her, even if he or she contracts an illness, he or she will recover quickly. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e189">A Discussion on the Three-Character Noun "Tropical Diseases" (Part 2) <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— A Soldier</p>
<p>One is the necessity of understanding so-called tropical diseases, because many of these diseases also have traces in our country, which is located in temperate and humid zones. One is that they should be classified and selectively incorporated into the textbooks of various disciplines. The reason is that, first, the name is correct and the language is smooth, and second, it is easy to enable medical students to obtain a universal infusion of knowledge about these diseases during their studies. To be fair, in so-called tropical medicine, there are also many purely tropical products or endemic diseases that are not easily seen in our territory, and there is no need to know them. Following the above second point of view can save medical students time and concepts, which seems to fit the so-called "killing two birds with one stone." Starting with the name "tropical disease" and establishing another name during the study period will cause medical students to have a distant discrimination, which will lose the original intention of attaching importance to it. I would like to ask the experts, is this not also a foolish idea? Summarizing the above, it can be briefly said that:</p>
<p>(1) The so-called tropical disease is a term defined by Europe and the United States based on geographical location.</p>
<p>(2) Most of the so-called tropical diseases also exist in temperate and cold zones.</p>
<p>(3) The main diseases in tropical diseases are endemic or epidemic infectious diseases caused by bacteria and parasitic organisms, and the clinical field is the widest in internal medicine, followed by dermatology and venereal surgery.</p>
<p>(4) Most of the diseases in tropical diseases are our endemic diseases, and we need to understand them.</p>
<p>(5) Most of the old textbooks did not include the above diseases. The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education, in view of the necessity of understanding this subject, have resolved to include tropical diseases as a compulsory subject in the later period of medical studies.</p>
<p>(6) Personal observation believes that from our geographical standpoint and from the needs of reality, we may as well take the essence and discard the dross, select the common diseases in our country, classify them and incorporate them into the textbooks of various disciplines, and there is no need to establish another name. This will enable medical students to obtain the necessary knowledge and the concept of equal importance with other disciplines in the original program imperceptibly.</p>
<p>Of course, we also hope that one day our medical students will have the motivation to specialize in tropical medicine. The Ministry of Health is already holding tropical medicine training courses, but it is only for the research and prevention of scattered endemic infectious diseases in various places! I am young and have little knowledge. The above is only based on my personal experiences, and there may be errors and inaccuracies. Moreover, education is a matter for the country, and the state has established officials who have special duties. There is no need for a young boy to chatter. However, I do not want to remain silent, so I offer my foolishness as material for the wise authorities to consult extensively. The words of a madman may be explored by a sage. I only have such an idea! (End)</p>
<h3 id="e190">Common Sense of Hygiene for Diseases of the Eyes, Ears, Nose, and Throat <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(113) General Symptoms of Throat Diseases</p>
<p>General symptoms of throat diseases. There are four main ones. They are (1) sore throat and pain when swallowing, (2) speech disorders, (3) breathing disorders, and (4) abnormal sensations. These four obvious symptoms often occur in any type of throat disease. A detailed description is given below.</p>
<p>(1) Sore Throat and Pain when Swallowing - Often an inevitable symptom in acute inflammation of the throat (such as tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, and phlegmon), chronic infiltration, and ulcers (such as tuberculous ulcers and cancer). The pain is not only felt when swallowing food, but also when swallowing saliva. Therefore, the patient's face often shows a painful expression. The head is often tilted to the affected side. The pain sometimes radiates to the ear on the affected side, or to the back of the head, temporal region, and mastoid process. There may be pain.</p>
<p>(2) Speech Disorders - When the mucous membrane of the posterior wall, lateral wall, and oral isthmus of the throat is swollen and enlarged, the shape of the throat cavity changes. The contraction of the muscles is also incomplete. The sound becomes distorted. The pronunciation of palatal sounds becomes difficult or even impossible. This type of sound is called an occlusive sound or a constricted sound. It is generally seen in tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, and retropharyngeal abscess. When the palate is perforated, ruptured, or the palatal veil is infiltrated and paralyzed, the closure between the oral cavity and the nasopharyngeal cavity is often incomplete. At this time, most of the exhaled air escapes into the nasal cavity. The sound produced by this situation is specifically called open nasal speech. Also, if the palatal veil is adhered to the posterior wall of the pharynx, or a tumor occurs in the throat cavity, most or all of the nasopharyngeal cavity is blocked. The sound produced by this situation is specifically called closed nasal speech.</p>
<p>(3) Breathing Disorders - Mostly caused by abscesses, tumors, infiltration, and foreign objects, resulting in the blockage of the nasopharyngeal cavity and causing disorders of nasal breathing. Since nasal breathing is obstructed, one must rely solely on oral breathing. Repeated snoring, sleep disorders, and other symptoms occur.</p>
<p>(4) Abnormal Sensations - One of the symptoms that patients often complain about in throat diseases is abnormal sensations. The most common sensations include itching, burning, dryness, and a foreign body sensation, etc. The irritation from abnormal sensations can repeatedly trigger coughing.</p>
<p>(114) Pharyngitis</p>
<p>Pharyngitis is inherently of two types: acute and chronic. However, based on case evidence, most cases are chronic. Therefore, I will now briefly discuss only the chronic type.</p>
<p>The most obvious cause of chronic pharyngitis is persistent oral breathing. Other causes include changes in climate (such as dry air and rapid changes in temperature), inhalation of dust, toxic gases and vapors, and abuse of alcoholic beverages and tobacco. In addition, there is a genetic relationship. Furthermore, diseases of the nose and paranasal sinuses, chronic tonsillitis, abnormal constitution (anemia and chlorosis), and chronic congestion of the upper respiratory tract (polycythemia, constipation, and heart, kidney, and lung diseases, etc.) are also common causes of this disease.</p>
<p>The disease types of chronic pharyngitis can be divided into three categories based on the differences in pathological anatomy and the localized area of inflammation, as follows:</p>
<p>I. Classification based on differences in pathological anatomy:</p>
<p>(1) Chronic Hypertrophic Pharyngitis</p>
<p>(2) Granular Pharyngitis</p>
<p>(3) Atrophic Pharyngitis</p>
<p>II. Classification based on the localized area of inflammation:</p>
<p>(1) Diffuse Pharyngitis</p>
<p>(2) Nasopharyngeal Catarrh</p>
<p>(3) Lateral Pharyngeal Band Inflammation</p>
<p>A detailed description of each of the above categories will not be provided.</p>
<p>The most common subjective symptoms of chronic pharyngitis are abnormal secretions and hyperesthesia. In the morning, a large amount of mucus is often coughed up by coughing. In addition, there are neck tension, a foreign body sensation in the throat, itching, dryness, ear pain when swallowing (lateral pharyngeal band inflammation), voice and speech disorders, and fatigue.</p>
<p>The treatment for chronic pharyngitis is to strictly prohibit irritation from tobacco and alcohol, pay attention to changes in climate, treat diseases of the nose and paranasal sinuses, chronic tonsillitis, abnormal constitution, and chronic congestion of the upper respiratory tract. As for local treatment, it must be carried out under the direction of a doctor.</p>

<p>The Youth Song Troupe has been enthusiastically sought after by all walks of life since giving away various movie songs. It has recently been heard that if there are any major singing movies released in the future, the troupe will continue to give away sheet music for fans. This time, the Mingxing Film Company's very large production of the 25th year - Qingming Season, has now been officially released. The theme song of the film, "Song of the Workers", has also been printed. It is said that the score is small and exquisite, the font is clear, and the style is quite beautiful. If you want to read it, please attach one cent of postage (two cents for other places) and send a letter to the troupe at No. 31, Lane 597, Wenchangshi Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Yesterday, all schools in the city welcomed Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing, so a large-scale parade was held in the Nanshi area. The New Children's Broadcasting Troupe participated in the conference, so the broadcast was suspended once yesterday and will continue as usual next Monday.</p>

<p>Since the bandits and puppets invaded Suiyuan, the selfless spirit of our frontline soldiers fighting bloody battles has aroused the spirit of the people across the country. In order to allow the people to further understand the truth of this incident, the Xinhua Film Company authorities did not hesitate to spend huge sums of money to send director Yang Xiaozhong and photographer Xue Boqing to the Suiyuan front line at the beginning of last month to shoot battle scenes. Under the terrifying circumstances of bullets flying for more than a month, they have painstakingly captured all the heroic resistance scenes that the people of the country are eager to know, and have decided to officially present them at the Jincheng Grand Theater starting today. At the same time, in order to give every citizen the opportunity to watch, they have exceptionally reduced the price and increased the number of screenings.</p>

<p>The Da Shanghai's grand contribution for the New Year is the huge film of life and love "Moon is Difficult to Become Full Again." The protagonist is Edward Arnold. Edward has starred in "Distinguished Conscience," "The Great Detective," and many other famous films. In this film, his expressions are even more profound and his acting is well-established. The co-stars include the handsome American Joe McCrea from "Double Door" and the newly discovered beautiful star Nancy Farmer. The film tells the story of a girl who does not love wealth but loves youth, and the plot is extremely tortuous and moving. The story is based on the masterpiece by the great writer Edna Ferber, the author of "Show Boat," and the producer is the authoritative Sam Goldwyn.</p>
