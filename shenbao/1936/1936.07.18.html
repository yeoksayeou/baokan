<p>— 宜</p>
<p>這次二中全會的决議案和宣言。連同蔣院長和張外長關於對外方針的剴切的演詞。使苦悶了多時的一般民衆。對於國家的前途。發生了好些樂觀的心理。第一。全會通過了西南中委唐紹儀等自動提出的撤銷西南兩機關這一個議案。並且對於兩廣負責的軍政當局重新任命了一番。從此只要中央政府進一步的健全起來。我國就可以完成眞正統一的局面。第二。全會所表示的禦侮的决心。比五全大會更明白更透澈。一年來中央外交政策的堅定。以及各省軍事領袖向心力的增厚。的確已經把侵略者的氣燄抑制了不少。此後如果全國軍民救國的意志眞正統一起來。那麼。恢復國權的目的就不難貫徹了。第三。中央對於兩廣的異動並不怎樣追究着責任。李白固然仍舊受着重大的付托。就是陳濟棠也只不過因為衆叛親離的綠故。更換了一個相當的職位。至於政令和軍令的統一。是救亡禦侮的根本條件。中央旣然只要求着這一點。在受過了革命思想的薰陶的兩廣軍事領袖們當然可能虛心地接受的。</p>
<p>然而量近幾日傳來的兩廣消息。郤不能不使我們在樂觀的心理上。浮起一抹暗影來。陳李白等已經一面發出了宣言。主張在廣州召集中央執監會非常會議。來推翻二中全會的决議案。一面自稱着聯軍總副司令。積極備戰。這種破壞有餘成事不足的舉動顯然只不過「為親者所痛而仇者所快」而已。因為就法理說。二中全會旣然是按照黨章而舉行。且有大多數中委出席的。陳李白等卽使用着極巧妙的文字上的詭辯。也斷不能否定它的合法性。就利害說。當這國難嚴重的時期。救國步驟的齊一。有着絕對的必要。現在陳李白等憑着一時的意氣。別樹旗幟來反對中央所明示的那種適當而且切實的步驟。豈不要引起局部的戰禍。召致橫來的外侮。至於因為失郤民衆同情的綠故。弄到身敗名裂的地步。更不消說得。可是他們都。有過革命的歷史。在最後的關頭。也許會擺脫了固執的成見和錯覺。顧全到大局的安危。把戰禍消弭於無形的。今日全國民衆最急切的希望就在此了。</p>

<p>（巴黎）法政府現贊同英法比三國在倫敦召開羅卡諾公約國會議、比國對此亦巳同意、該會將於」月二十三日開幕、德意均不參加、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）羅卡諾二次會議、改於本月二十三日、在倫敦舉行、法國政府不復加以反對之說、頃由負責人士加以證實、屆時法國當由國務總理萊翁勃倫、外長台爾博斯代表出席、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於羅卡諾會議一項問題、國會休憩室中一般議員頃聲稱、英國現主張改由英法比三國在倫敦舉行會議、而不復在比京並在開會之前、先由三國發表共同公報、用以說明會議目標、係在設法解决歐洲各項懸案、此項公報文字、業已擬就、正在徵求法國同意中云、又聞政府將派閣員一員、前往柏林、與德國政府進行協商、以為他日另開會議之準備、屆時歐洲各關係國、均當被邀出席云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）羅卡諾公約會議原定七月二十二日在比京召集、茲因昨晨英內閣對於此事未有决議、故該會議日期·議程·與組織、仍待磋商、此間人士之意、無論會議何時舉行、當以解决歐洲問題為其唯一目的、此舉最宜由五强會議成之、法國如以為當先舉行三强會議、以籌備較大之會議、則今當疏通英國、英國不準備參加三强會議、專事登記調解努力之失敗、而不具有告成解决歐洲問題之目的、此間以為英法比三國成立西方集團、以對付德奧意三國之中歐集團、不能裨益和平、昨日英外相艾登已向法比大使釋明此節、外相昨在下院答覆問話時、聲明羅卡諾簽字各國、除德國外、三月十九日在倫敦草成之建議、以備應付調解努力失敗之局勢、今並未發生云、（十七日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）一般人相信、內閣對於未來羅卡諾會議、應吾展期一層、尚未確實有所决定、此在政界人士以為羅卡諾會議、原定議程、係因德國對於英國問題表、延不答復、爰擬由英法比三國採取共同措置、以資應付、現自德奧協定成立之後、意德兩國業已互相接近、若仍維持原來議事日程、則意德兩國、將因英法比三國接近之故、而愈益密切合作、以故羅卡諾會議若果舉行、其討論範圍、自應加以限制、此外羅卡諾第一次會議、前於三月十九日所成立之協定、規定應由各關係國參謀部、商訂保障法比兩國安全之永久辦法、英國因恐照此辦理、轉足促使意德兩國益形接近、故不擬予以訂定、內閣現令艾登外相、根據上述見解、與法比兩國進行談判、外相已於午後延見各該國大使有所商談、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）關於羅卡諾會議之目標、負責方面頃聲稱、法國政府所抱見解、與英國相同、目標維何、卽（一）參照德奧兩國所訂立之協定、以研究歐洲一般局勢、（二）籌備另開會議、而由意德兩國參加、至本屆羅卡諾會議開會之後、務當擬就一種最妥善之方式、俾與德國進行談話、藉使歐洲局勢、得以澄淸、又謂、英國政府前於本年四月三日、向法比兩國提出祖保函件、聲明英國因保障兩國安全所應採取各項措置、目前法國政府並不願要求英國實施此項措置云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）自英國前於四月七日提出問題表之後、德國政府迄今尚未答覆、外交界人士頃於昨日晚間宣稱、德國政府現擬發表一種聲明畫、用以答覆英國政府、同時對於意大利所成立之阿比西尼亞帝國、亦當加以承認云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）德奧兩國日前成立協定之後、政界人士原恐意德兩國互相接近、或將發生種種危險、因而為之忐忑不安、現則此項憂慮業已稍減、綠就各該入士所見、意。德兩國所行政策、尤其是在巴爾幹半島方面、根本上卽格格不相入、以故兩國接近、徒有其表、夷考其實、僅欲互相利用、以遂私圖耳、按之羅馬消息、意國前於用兵阿比西尼亞之際、對於勃倫納山隘防務無暇兼顧、乃在暗中竭力贊助德奧雨國進行談判、迨意阿戰事結束之後、意國仍力促德奧協定之成立、此其用意、不外兩端、一欲藉以曉示英法兩國、其對於奧國問題、非得意國之援助不可、二欲避免德奧兩國合併之迫切危險、如是而已、據聞意國最近曾向英國再度提出保證、聲明該國在巴爾幹半島方面、始終抱和平意向、庶幾英國得以取消其與地中海沿岸各國所訂之互助協定、此固意國參加羅卡諾會議之最大障礙也、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）下院今日開會時、議員對於南菲聯邦國防大臣畢羅氏由英返抵南菲時所發關於殖民地問題之言論、紛加質問、由首相包爾溫一一作答、議員問此次畢羅氏來英時、政府與之會商、曾否正式談及德國要求收回菲洲殖民院問題、曾吾使畢羅氏信以為他日德國如提出此項要求、英政府將予以同情云、首相答稱、渠意此項問話、實出於誤會、渠聞畢羅氏歸抵南菲接見報界人物時、曾親自聲明渠（畢氏）所表示之印象、乃與個人及團體談話所得私人之觀察的結果、而非與英政府中人特殊討論之結果云、就英政府在本國之態度而論、渠除前在下院對此問題所作之言論外、不能更有所述云、於是保守黨議員克羅未特與邱吉爾績請作更明白之解釋、首相答稱、政府之答言已可謂透澈明白矣、至於頃問所關政府曾否使畢羅氏信以為他日德國如提出關於殖民地之要求、英政府將予以同情一節、渠今答曰未、（十六日路透電）</p>

<p>（二）意國願依照原定計劃、而與中歐洲各友邦相合作、但此種計劃、並非組成中歐洲集團、而與歐洲其他各國相離異、歐洲其他各國對於意國、若果採取敵對態度、則當別論、至歐洲各國亦當在中歐洲集團四週、自行成立組織、</p>
<p>（三）歐洲各國當分為强弱兩種一項原則、意國仍信守之、幷願與各强國合作、關於此層、一般人以為意國業向蘇俄進行接洽、至包圍德國之計劃、意國雖拒不參加、但亦不欲與德國單獨修好、此外、羅卡諾二次會議、業己决定先由英法比三國會同舉行、幷不召開五國會議、此在意國輿論、雖均表示不滿、但認為當與法國合作、仍屬必要、關於此層、意國業已發出聲明、必俟地中海沿岸各國前於去年秋間所訂立之互助辦法、予以撤消之後、始可出而參加、羅卡諾會議、迄今此項互助辦法、既未宣告撤消、意國自有拒不參加之理由、幷當引以為幸、首相墨索里尼對於此項會議、以為意國苟不出而參加、决難覓獲解决方案、自以遷移時日為得計、</p>
<p>（四）歐洲改造方式、務當切合實際、質言之、各項重要問題、必須成立折衷辦法、觀於德奧兩國最近所成立之協定、卽可知之、至以縮減軍備而論、實際上既已不可能、則關係各國必須限制軍備、而國聯會盟的第十六條所規定之制裁辦法、亦當加以修正、俾意國重行參加國聯會各項活動、</p>
<p>（五）意國此項計割、原具有修正歐戰媾和條約之意、但政界人士不以為然、幷謂意國與南斯拉夫、既融洽無間、卽土耳其與希臘兩國、雖均參加地中海互助辦法、但意國與各該國各項現行協定、亦仍有效、同時意國對於羅馬尼亞現行政策之發展、亦密切加以注視、至對於捷克國、則政界人士幷無一字道及之、其政策是否與德國對捷政策相同、尚不可知云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3 id="c81">廣田內閣到何處去（二） <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— 家禾</p>
<p>廣田由霞關（外交省所在地）一走進永田町的首相官邸，就更換了一副面孔。他不再是柔順的羔羊，處處唯軍部之命是從，反常與軍部齟齬。因為肅軍大題目，壓在軍部的頭上；因為寺內大將，反對可紊亂軍紀的少壯派行為；因為永野大將，厲行海軍完整的紀律；所以，內閣成立後，不是廣田為履行口約而忙，乃是軍部忙於自己的「安內工作」。陸軍方面，負「二·二六政變貴任的人物，相繼去職，就是勞苦功高，以平民出身而一躍為男爵，有奪取滿洲之功的本莊繁大將，也要退離皇城（辭侍從武官長職）。海軍方面，則有曾用「國體明徵一問題，與急進法西斯相呼應的眞崎勝次們，被永野」海相惟出部外。正在這個當兒，廣田首相，破歷來成例，下令不許三長官——書記官長，調查局長，法制局長——列席閣議。這樣，不特沒有履行組閣前的口約，而且反把軍部的信託者吉田茂夷為自己的僚屬。</p>
<p>由此，日本政治的舞台，展開了官僚，政黨和軍部，的混戰。關於官僚對廣田內閣的襲擊，以及廣田的反攻；政黨對於官僚的暗鬥，以及與廣田的明爭，我在中報周刋第二十五期裏，巳經槪括地說過，為免重復起見，本文盡可能內不再贅述。</p>
<p>廣田不僅削弱內閣調查局的權力，尙切斷各省少壯官僚對於軍部的聯絡。內相潮息之輔，施闊刀大斧，鏟除那些素與軍部聲氣相通的人們；用「選舉違法」的名義，大捕議員，使與法西斯有關係的，胆戰心驚，卽鼎鼎大名的久原房之助，也因之一行方不明」；此外又動員全國的警察，逮捕那右傾的行動家。這麼一來，軍部山於外圍勢力的消除，聲勢未免大减。這些工作正吿一段落，特別議會開幕了。陸軍也知道，議會是審判他們的機關，不能不執着可使議員們禮讓的武器，牠就是「戒嚴令」。於是打破日本議會史的記錄，神聖的議會，在槍刀包圍圍圍之下而開幕。</p>
<p>開會之日，在資產階級陣營裏，捲起了一個「聖旨奉答」的運動，因為破歷來的成例，天皇特別地在勅書上把「二·二六」政變提出來。政變是過去的事實，勅書上就載着牠，那也不足大驚小怪。日本有產者？如此地張皇，目的是在於追究政變的責任。愈認眞於這一點，就無異於愈對軍部加上了無法避免的壓力。</p>
<p>廣田首相，也在「施政演說」中指出「此次空前的不祥事件，……牠的原因，固在於軍內外一部份不穩分子的策動」。要撲滅牠，唯一的方法，只有「憲政的昂揚」。愈昂揚憲政，便愈使軍部就範，有產者政治家的目的是如此，能否達到，那是另一宗事。因之，我們的廣田首相引起了有產者議員的贊美。他不僅大胆地維護憲政，而月對社會大衆黨麻生久的「資本主義制度之正否」的質問，還公開地答覆：「其本義不知也」。儘菅風見章氏，笑為這是「不及中學生程度的答辯」，而他郤袒然地吿訴浜田國松：「我對於產業統制，自由主義等等所謂資本主義之正否的問題，……因為不是專門家，所以缺乏這類的知識，而且也沒有充分的研究」。組閣之前，他不是否認自由主義，而標榜「庶政一新」，要從事改革資本主義不合理的部份嗎？他又不是曾提出統制大名　因之獲得「統制內閣」的尊稱嗎？現在他一舉否認了牠，難怪朝日新聞說：「這可看做自己否定的大胆答辯」。</p>

<p>近一週來、華北局勢、顯出了很大的演變、因為日方一切人事·政策·軍事·經濟。各點、均已準備妥當、不得不在最近期內、要求一個明確的解决、上海的總領事會議、以及天津一連三次的武官會議、正是這準備妥當的表示、所以日駐屯軍部部附松室孝良、十日在北平發表談話、「華北經濟開發、中日雙方均屬有利、依目前情况、誠有必要」、又說、「華北政治、頗有改進必要、如當局願自努力、日方决從旁贊助」、所謂開發、大槪是由日方來開發、所謂改進、大槪又是冀察政權明朗化、和冀束組織與冀察政權合流而已、</p>
<p>不過在目前、軍事上·政治上·日方是不打算立採什麼步騾的、他的第一步、還是經濟開發、在這目標下、向華北當局施以種種壓力、對於這極種積極壓力、當然需要適當人員去應付、於是在中央與宋哲元兩方面敦請下、熟悉華北經濟情形的王克敏、就於九日上午十一時三十八分、到了北平、王氏北來、日方異常重視、而企望從此展開華北的局勢、所以一方面日外相有田立卽電令此間日本官憲、「絕對恊助」另一方面、日方的坦克車、就－連兩天、在天津·豐台·北平·通縣四個地方之間、來往示威、以為恩威並用的手段、</p>
<p>當王克敏由滬到京時、此間會盛傳他將接任冀察政委會經濟委員會主席、到津時、此間又盛傳他行篋中携有﹁經濟合作方案」、但他在天津與日駐屯軍司令田代晤談、及在平與宋哲元·淸水·花輪·等中日當局晤談後、他此來態度、就很明白的表示饑來、（一）中國方面、有與日方開始經濟合作的準備、但須與兩國有利、（二）所謂經濟合作方案、中國方面商、目前並無成議、他此來、不過是和此間中日當局作意見的探詢、所以最近將返京一行、以後如屬必要、並將不時往來於南京、北平間、統計王氏自七日抵津以來、在平津共勾留一星期、這期間、他與中日雙方當局曾有過幾次宴會與會談，結果頗為鬨滿、十二日、由北平兩去時、並有了很肯定的表示，謂此次南去、將儘於月底前北返、而對於經委會主席事、亦允於彼時再行老慮、王氏此行、大槪對於此間中日當局態度、均已明瞭、南返之後、對政府當局、必有報吿與請示也、</p>
<p>當局的撐持</p>
<p>外力壓迫、已經够受的了、而內部又加上種種的衰落與動盪、比如最近天津方而倒閉的商店、就有三百八十多家、－般經濟的蕭條、可想而知、所以最近冀·察·平·津·等地方政府的二十年度經常費頂算、不得不努力减縮了、又比·如石友三通緝令、已明令取銷、明令中有功在國家等字樣、而最近、默將被任為冀察政委會委員、當局處境之困難、與多方委曲求全的苦心、可見－斑、</p>
<p>陳中孚前由粵經日同抵北平後、立卽銷假、復任外交委員會主席職、天津市餐張自忠、前因處境困難曾風傳有消極說、但二日來平、向宋報吿接洽一切後、八日下午、又返津坐鎭、凡此種種、足見華北各當局在人事上、巳較飾和諧多多、而步趨似亦甚－致、尤其豐台與塘沾事件之解决、上自宋哲元、下迄全體幹部及士兵、悉能忍辱負重、鎭定應付、其用心亦殊可佩、</p>
<p>關於地方治安、十三日下午－時許、公安局方面、會會同日本驚憲、往鹽台正陽街二十五號、及該街劉家胡同七號·十三號·等處、查抄毒品巢穴騙共抄出白而十饑斤、並胄警捕去主犯韓國人趙某·李某·金某·等七名、如對於巨匪劉小猴之捕獲、對齋復吸白面犯、及勾結某國人强佔民房等犯人的立置極刑、皆是當局維持社會安寗决心的表現、最近西郊警長吳恩福、因捕匪遭擊斃、各界發起捐欵撫恤時、連日本新支那社社長黑根氏、亦槪然捐出十元來、足見關於當局維持治安的决心、卽連有眼光的外國人、也是很贊同的、</p>
<p>最近華北金融、有種種謠傳、而天津方面、前曾因忽然有輔幣三四萬元流通市面、引起種種不安、北平方面、亦因發現大量偽製的中國．交通·河北·等銀行鈔票、予法幣流通信用以莫大的打擊、在這種金融不安的情形下、於是當局一面派員重行檢封平津存銀以固法幣信用、一面對、於擾亂金融事件、嚴加取締、以保法幣流通信用之安全、關於第一方面、已由胡毓坤等檢封完峻、北平有現銀－五·一九一·五五六元、消津有三六．九七八·〇〇〇元、合為五二·－六九·六五○元、關於第二方面、本月五日、會在北平景山東街大學夾道三號、現巳返國之美國海軍將軍牛維樂．（Newell）家的、管軍事人舒景山處、抄得大批偽製鈔票、及改製偽鈔之機器多件、並捕獲犯人舒潤山．舒景山．王雲普·等二十五人、據供、前後已造偽鈔二萬元之鉅、此案如何發落、現尙不知、但至少對於偽鈔票事、已予以很大的打擊矣、</p>

<p>茲再將本年為首三月，上海工商業之各項異動，共中特別値得注意之商號，按月列之於後，以供社會各界參考。</p>
<p>（一）屬於一月份者　新創之英商美華銀行，於本月十五日開始營業，正式開幕之期尙未露佈。該行因與前大信實業銀行合併組成，曾於四川路二一〇號營業有年，故由其性質言，似以列入擴充較宜。錢莊業於本月中計擴充資本者二家，縮减資本者亦二家，改組者八家，閉歇者四家，此係根據錢業公會所公佈。去年錢業之一般衰落，實堪注意。交通業中華商利利汽車公司，突於十四日宣吿停業。該公司規模宏大，有汽車八〇輛，於該業中素稱巨擘，其影響於汽車出租業之鉅，亦正如去年十月間閉歇之公用黃汽車公司同。化學工業中華明火柴廠之改組復業，亦足重視；該公司自於二十三年十二月間與泰豐灌頭食品公司司時宣吿停業後，為時已越一載。呢絨洋貨販賣業，本月計收縮一家，改組一〇家。較之去年十一月僅改組一家，十二月改組閉歇均無及去年同期之改組一家，相差甚鉅。此外如毛冷業亦有相當變動；於對外貿易出超聲中，似亦不宜忽視。籌備已久之大新有限公司，於本月十日宣吿開幕。該公司資本總額達港幣六〇〇萬元，總公司設在香港。實為本市百貨業之重大發展。</p>
<p>（二）屬於　月份者　美國運通銀行於本月中旬宣吿停止銀行業務，該行為美國該總行之上海支店，開業迄今，業已十九年餘。此次停止銀行業務，據稱係該行預定計劃，藉為擴充該行運輸，旅行及其他業務之凖備。寶昶錢莊為本市錢業公會會員，資本為正本十四萬元及附本十四萬元，平日營業素稱穩健，此次因各股東鑒於百業蕭條，營業前途毫無把握，遂自動宣吿停業。本月中標金業復有二家閉歇。該業自去年幣制改革後。四月來先後倒閉者已達九家：計十月底有嘉泰，源康詳，恊大詳三家；十一月份有聚昌元，永益，豐棣永三家；十二月份有仁承一家，及本月份之生大永記，元大永二家。</p>
<p>（三）屬於三月份者　甲·金融業方面：（一）中央儲蓄會於十六日正式宣吿開幕，該會為中央信託局撥資設立，資本國幣五百萬元，委李叔明先生為經理，專營有獎儲蓄，前中法儲蓄會所有儲戶悉歸該會接辦。（二）銀行票據承兌所亦於十六日宣吿成立，該所受本市銀行業同業公會之委託並根據上海聯合凖備委員會委員銀行代表大會之議决而設立，專辦同業間票據承兌業務，經理為朱博泉先生。加入銀行巳達三十八家，承兌基金為國幣七，六二三，七五〇元，實為銀行業同業合作之新進展。乙·公用事業中：浦東電氣公司經本屆股東常會議决再增資本五十萬元：國際電信局遵交通部命令撤銷，亦為本市公用事業中之二大變動。丙·工業方面：（一）廣東兄弟樹膠公司自受物價暴落影響於去年十二月中宣吿停業後，數月來因負債過巨，無法復業。此次經各債權人議决共同維持復業，並合組維持業務委員會以管理生產。該公司總廠設香港，上海分廠創於民國十六年，僱有工人三百六十餘人，每日可生產橡膠鞋一萬打，對於橡膠業之影響實鉅。（二）揚子麵粉公司之閉歇，亦為麵粉業之一損失：該公司工廠雖設南京下關，然於上海設有總事務所；資本為國幣三十萬元，每日最大產粉量為一萬包。丁·販賣商業中除百貨業新創突增巳如前述外，本月份復有二聯合營業所之成立値得注意：一為中國機製石粉聯合營業所之開幕，一為興安蔗糖營業所之成立。中國機製石粉聯合營業所由中國機製石粉廠同業聯合會上海會員順昌，瑞泰，振新，中國，及無錫會員成泰，成大，永利等各機製石粉廠聯合組成，以發售各廠出品為目的。興安蔗糖營業所由糖商志城，集春，芳來，捷春，福裕，天祥，合愼，德豐，振興，萬和，兆泰，同昌，三春，萬春，福成，泰源等十六家所組成，以推銷福建蔗糖為目的。年來我國工商業產銷合作之風日見普遍，實亦為可喜現象之一。（完）</p>

<p>國立北平師範大學文學院院長黎錦熙氏、於上月底由北到京、播音「注音符號與簡體字、」並向教部接洽公務、據談、注音漢字推行情形、利弊得失、及簡體字停止等事、如下、</p>
<p>注音漢子　正在推行</p>
<p>政府上年度以鉅額經費推行短期義教、本年度更增加至四百餘萬元、同時推行民教、經費亦百餘萬元、此等教育必未普及、而確有實效、其中要點仍在語文工具之改良、注音漢字係以注音符號輔助大衆識字、目的尚不在國　統一、教育部於上年撥欵二萬元。鑄造注音漢字銅模、每套有二·三·四·五各號大小四副、每副的五千餘字至七千字、定自本年七月一日起、凡小學及民校之課木、及補充讀物、均須用注音漢字印刷、否則不予審定、或加取締、據國語推行委員會調查、此項課本、半年以來、已多行用、惟師資缺乏、往往使字旁注音等於雙　、故本人此次來京、卽據國語會議决案向部建議、注重師資、力戒敷衍、並謀注音符號傳習上之簡易化·普遍化·至部鑄之銅模·二三兩號字已由中華書局交貨、四五兩號卽成、商務印書館創鑄之賽銅模、已出注音三號字、亦美觀而價極廉、</p>
<p>注音漢字　有利無弊</p>
<p>教育界人士、有慮及注意漢字之弊者、（一）以音代字、喧賓奪主、不知漢字為生活環境所必需、斷無專讀在旁之注音者、如已認識讀字者、卽可專讀漢字、不管右旁之注音、如遇生字、一看注音、卽可由音知義、如識字甚少者、右旁便是「先生」、卽可山音識字、如全不識字者、暫時依音拼讀、一樣了解、似此賓主相得、何來喧奪、（二）文字印刷、轉多麻煩、不知注音漢字之鉛字、乃將注音釘死在漢字右旁、印刷有此利器、起稿者不必須注音、卽可付印、排版者不排注音、一舉兩得、校對得不看注音、决無訛誤、卽成書後、清楚美觀、但習注音、皆能閱讀、（三）注符大小、有損目力、不知現行兒童民衆一切新讀物用　號漢字者多、從無用到五號者、課本更係二號以上之大字、其右旁固定之注音、形體不小、筆劃又簡、且係旁參、並非專讀、於目力何損、（四）印品技贅迷人眼簾、此乃識字已多之智識分子、本不意識、隨便批評、並未為初學兒童及失學民衆着想、不足辯、（五）備而不用、致成贅就、此則只宜注重師資、不當因噎廢食、本人之來、卽為救此弊也、</p>
<p>簡體字仍　自由使用</p>
<p>簡體字表、經土年八月教育部公布、凡三百二十四字、大都為社會已經通用之字、原可不推而自行、本年一月行政院令「暫緩推行」誤會者以為此是禁止用簡體字、不知院令係將部定之「各省市教育行政機關推行部頒簡體字辦法」九條、從緩辦理、並非取消公布之簡體字表也、今後如教科課本等、欲用簡體字、仍可自山、初中一律審定、一般社會照舊寫簡體字、誰來干涉、簡體字表之公布、不過是表示「審完」與「追認」此第一批之外、卽當製定全譜、以供小學民校習字之用、因簡體字專為便利書寫、無關閱讀、而注音漢字則專便閱讀、無關書寫也云、聞黎氏一俟與教部接洽公務完畢、日內將乘掄赴湘一行云、</p>

<p>— 顧文淑</p>
<p>自從馳明的盧梭，發明了人類是一概平等的話；便引起了世界上莫大的騷動；好像帝制的被打倒，和民主的勃興等，但是除了這些外，還有一件也是被這學說所推動而發生的事，就是十九世紀以來的女權運動，全世界的婦女都在走上或預備走上解放的道路，希望不論在政治上，社會上，經濟上，要和男子受同等待遇，不過假使我們用顯微鏡的目光細察起來，我們就可以威覺到目前世界上，不論那一個女權最發達的國家，他國裏的婦女，還可以說沒有達到眞正的平等，那麼什麼纔是眞正的平等呢？下面一封信，可以指示我們眞正平等的方向，這封信是一個法國女子（Madame　Sante）寫給巴黎晚報（Paris—Soir）的，我現在把這對信翻在下面，貢獻給讀者們。</p>
<p>前天早晨，我（Sante自稱）出去買些雜物，因為我是個平常的主婦，在路上有一張佈告，吸引我的注意力。</p>
<p>今日國家婦女連合會，開會討論反對戰爭與法西斯。</p>
<p>我看了後，認為很不錯，我們女人不能讓男子們去胡作胡為，我們也要出主意；我們須要不論在社會上，經濟上，政治上，宗教上，和他們平等，我們須要享有工作不受限制的權利，和男子同等的薪金，完全的選舉權和被選舉權等，後來我轉念一想，我們單是和男子爭和自己有利的權利，而對於和自己無利的權利像服兵等苦役，置之不聞不問，我想這種片面的，不完整的平等，決定不是天賦我（第二十六期）們的平等吧！</p>
<p>全國的女同胞們，看了這封信，我們應當明白怎樣去找這神聖的眞平等了。</p>
<h3 id="c230">蘇聯婚姻法的新改革 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 魯沙白女士</p>
<p>蘇聯的婚姻法原來是根據自由結婚法草成的，一面祗要男女兩性合意，便可以結婚，不受任何束縛。兩人中有一人要離婚，也祗須依法請求完成一個極簡單的手續，就可仳離。這是蘇聯自由結婚的根本精神，一向很受對蘇聯表示好感的各國的稱讚。但實際上運用起來，却不免有很多人利用離婚手續的簡單，使蘇聯的性道德陷於墮落。譬如家庭的破裂和兒童的棄置等事，隨處都可看見，這對於趨向社會主義建設的蘇聯社會，確是一大缺點。</p>
<p>蘇聯當局對這事實，極為重視，便積極進行改革結婚法；今年五月二十六日，便將改革的方案，交各官廳，工塲，農塲上作普遍的討論，微求大衆的意見。這次結婚法改革的內容相當廣泛，它的根本原則仍是以自由結婚法為基礎，但特別重視父母的義務，同時更注重家庭的意義。</p>
<p>改革後的婚姻法，第一是離婚較前困難；從來離婚登記費要繳五盧布，現在增加為第一次離婚繳五十盧布，第二次離婚繳一百五十盧布，第三次離婚繳三百盧布。離婚時倘有子女，應歸母親扶養，但由父親支出月薪的三分之一供給母親作兒童的撫養費，倘不履行道條約，卽判處兩年的徒刑。</p>
<p>男子負有支付撫養費的義務時，他的護照上卽有詳細的記載，無論他在蘇聯邦任何地方工作，都經常由月薪中扣除，不得拖欠。至於離婚的手續，也仍只要一方的意志卽可成立，離婚通知書也只須用掛號寄去卽可。這仍舊保存昔日自由結婚的精神，但不過加重了離婚前後的經濟負担，對那般隨意離合的男女加以限制而巳。</p>
<p>據這次的改革看來，似乎特別限制男子，但對女子方面也有相當的限制。有子女的母親應負擔撫育子女的責任，倘不履行這種義務，父親有提起告訴之權：：所以這决的改革並不偏於任何一方，而是專重雙方為父母的責任的。</p>
<p>改革的第二點是獎勵生育，有七個子女的父母，生到第八個後，從第一年到第五年，每年由政府津貼二千盧布：生到十一個以後，第一年給以五千盧布，第二年以後到第四年，每年給以三千盧布。蘇聯的這種積極獎勵生育，正是因為它的產業建設發展，一切需要着新的勞力，同時為了建設新的社會文化生活，所以政府對於多產多育者不能不予以經濟上的援助。</p>
<p>改革的第三點是對妊婦的保護，禁止各地工廠藉故將妊婦停職或拒絕收用，違者嚴重處罰。在以前的結婚法中，本來也有這條規定，但這次改革後，對於任婦的保護更為周密，而對於上述將妊婦停職或拒絕收用妊婦者處罰，也較前更為嚴峻。</p>
<p>最後是關於墮胎問題，在革命後的混亂期間，因為男女都從事於社會工作，對於限制生育以至墮胎等，在那時只要當事人願意，卽可隨便實行。但因此也發生性道德的腐化，引起重大的社會缺憾。</p>
<p>現在蘇聯的國民生活，巳趨安定，像墮胎這非法的手段早巳沒有必要，所以這次修改結婚法，便禁止一切危害母親身體的非法生產；違此禁例，卽處一年到三年的徒刑。但經醫生認為有墮胎的必要時，則不在禁止之列。同時並指定墮胎的孕婦，須在有最優良設備的國立病院中施受手術。</p>
<p>蘇聯政府更注意到對產婦的保護，特別研究無痛分娩的方法，最近已發現一種極有效果的方法，正在努力於這方法的普及。</p>
<p>以上是這次改革結婚决的梗概，由此可知蘇聯現在已重視到以家庭為中心的社會生活，但這次不是僅僅重視家庭生活，提倡舊的道德，而完全是新社會建設發展下必然的要求。確實，蘇聯現在的社會文化生活已一年一年地提高，人民生活富裕，國家經濟充實，在這一切社會基礎的反映下，為社會生活細胞的家庭，當然也要求着有更新的更健全的更美滿的生活，這次結婚的改革，便完成是由於這樣的動機。這確是蘇戀人民生活上的一大改革！</p>
<h3 id="c231">擇夫標準 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 諸滕曼蓉</p>
<p>老實說，一個女子如非另有了原因而才實行獨身主義的，那麽，到了相當年齡，誰都要經過一個「結婚」的階段。「結婚」當然是一樁大事；但是，我曾看見過很多的人？把「結婚」看得很輕，簡直不當一回事；不過她們也有理由，她們說：「結婚了要是「好」，那末不生問題；要是不好，則譬如沒有結婚，儘可離婚。」哼這種話說得好寫意，須知現行法律雖可離婚，但金錢與精神，一定兩受其損；並且譬如和甲結婚了不久就離婚，但離婚了再和乙結婚，但不久文離婚。像這樣的結婚離婚，眞是視同兒戲，試問，像這樣的女子，還能嫁得到好的丈夫嗎？還能得到社會的同情嗎？</p>
<p>「那麽要怎樣才能嫁得到好的丈夫呢？」這是一個很易解答的問題，自然，第一不要把「結婚」看得輕易，我們應當長存一個結婚了不能離婚的思想，這樣一來，自然會把「結婚」看得鄭重，把「結婚」看得鄭重了，那麽就須注重「擇夫」注重了「擇夫」，自然就能嫁到好的丈夫了！</p>
<p>不過「擇夫」也須預先定一個標準，但是這標準也得有些分寸；譬如，一個村姑想嫁出洋的留學生，一個女工想嫁銀行的總理，這都是出乎情理之外而又絕對不能成事實的擇夫標準；並且卽使萬一成了事實後，我敢說，將來也决無好果！所以我們在未定標準之前，須自己想想我是一個怎樣地位的入，應該和怎樣的一等人結婚，是最合宜而又最美滿，總之，既不能媽虎，又不能苛求，須要合乎情理之內的定一個擇夫標準。</p>
<p>說起了擇夫標準，我又想起了一件關於這問題的事情：</p>
<p>在我家的附近，有一　雜貨店，店主有一個女兒，二八年華，秀色可餐，她父親因為店中人少，所以教她輟了學助理店務。因此店中生意大好，附近的一輩子浮滑少年，且和她取了個「雜貨西施」的綽號！</p>
<p>「雜貨西施」到了這樣的年齡，當然有很多的人來和她作伐，但是，橫不成，豎不就，說了很多人，都不稱她的心</p>
<p>隔了很久，她終於和人結婚了，據說，對方是一個很漂亮的西裝少年，原來她就早定了一個擇夫標準：「不是西裝少年決不結婚！」所以她在初見時就十二分地滿意，然而，她就因了這滿意而鑄成大錯！原來，這漂亮的西裝少年，是一個毫無學識的理髮匠，她事前單看了表面，並沒有細細地探聽他的職業與學識，到結了婚才知道他是理髮匠，但是大錯鑄成，悔已莫及！</p>
<h3 id="c232">頭髮報國的日本婦女 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 一髪</p>
<p>在自認為非常時期的日本，十一年度的總預算，已達到二十三億以上。內中用於擴充軍備的費用的，當然已經可觀了。但是日本的國民還是紛紛獻金報國，以為後盾。小學生曾集香烟錫紙，以購愛國號飛機。現在又有一部份的婦女，提倡頭髮報國。在國難時期的我國，既沒有强力國防的，又無充分的經濟，不知我國女性將以何種方法，報答祖國。</p>
<p>當一個女子在每天梳頭的時候，總有幾根頭髮，隨着木梳落下。普通便丟在垃圾箱裏，付之一炬。神奈川縣厚木町女子靑年團’於去年年底開始向各村各町，喚起婦女，囑將梳下的頭髮保存起來，一個月中已積得三十二斤，為製假髮店購去。得洋二元五角，獻與橫須賀海軍鎮守府，為國防費。得前大角海相的感謝狀、今歲四月將擴大宣傳，徵收全國女子加入。蒐集的方法，先用印有說明語的紙袋，發給村中各住家。每天便由女子靑年團派人挨戶收集，並以空袋調換，這個方法是仿警察局在暑天收集蒼蠅的方法。日本婦女對此很表同情，並不以兒戲視之。</p>
<p>據做假髮的人說，現在科學雖然昌明，但是用人工製造頭髮，尚未發明。從前假髮都是用於舞台上的。自從都會女子，盛行剪髮之後。當出嫁時候，需用髮髻而一時又留不起來，於是不得不利用假髮。此外藝妓的習慣，是必需有高大的髮髻。剪髮女子，做藝妓的時候，也用假髮。故近年以來，假髮的銷路大增，而來源却仍是很少。製造假髮的頭髮，是不能利用已死者的，就是熨髮之後，因為容易脆斷，亦不合用的。同樣的頭髮，都市的婦女，營養力較農村為佳，故價亦稍貴。</p>
<p>製造假髮的，把頭髮收集之後，放在釜內者沸銷毒。雖白髮，赤髮，亦可染成光可鑑人的黑髮，由專門工人，用人工來整理之後，做成日本式的大髮髻。此種工人，為數很少，非常珍貴。以前大商店玻璃櫥裏的木美女的頭上，也是用假髮的，工人便藉此維持生活。自女子斷髮之後，營業大盛，已有求過於供的現象了。</p>

<p>想吃飯先要錢不做工錢那會來？　不念書不識字正是開眼的瞎子；　憑勞力謀生是世問最光明的人</p>
<p>過去半年來記者會訪問二十餘位婦女，每决特寫，都在本刊披露，承讀者表示同情，使人無限感奮！這二十餘位之中，有女界先進，有學術專家，有社會領袖，也有新賢妻良母，都是女界中不可多覲的人才。各言其志，各盡其意，凡所論列，必有獨特的見地。至於訪問她們的主旨：一則聽取名言讜論，指示婦女怎樣做現代的女人？二則表揚各人的事業，提高婦女的地位；三則給女界有個發表意見的機會，可以展拓各人的懷抱，旨在改良家庭生活與教育，主張男女平權，鼓吹婦女樹大公無私的精神，共同效力於社會國家的事業。但是婦女問題是多方面的，此後除既定方針外，當不時採訪職業婦女的生活資料，謀女界解放的出路。這裏先來介紹一位製罐女工的生活，也可以檢見得她內心的反映。</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>康元製罐廠是公認為組織健全實施科學管理有成效的國貨工廠，前天我走進工塲時，數百工友，正勤奮操作，其中有位七八二號女工，手術允見敏捷，我便請她到會客空來，作一度通常談話。她名喚王愛美，上海江灣人，纔二十八歲，可憐哪，已做了兩年的嫠婦！我首先調查她的生世及家庭狀況，據說：「我生長江灣，世代業農，二十二歲出嫁，我夫本是康元廠的工頭，婚後我也進廠工作，過去六七年中，我倆依手藝生活，還算適意，不幸吾夫於兩年前去世，遺孤現只四歲，由我慈母帶領。憶先夫在日，恩愛非常，從無間言，滿想成家立業，誰料遭此慘變，自嘆命薄而已，現住本廠附近，每月膳宿需費十二元，衣着雜用五六元，月得工資運夜工禮拜工共的二十元，尚足維持生活。夫家老母在堂，我因餘暇甚少，不能常侍左右，究竟是苦人，身體不由自主，賺錢也不容易，要說盡些孝道，實在為難，大概有錢人總能盡孝道的吧？」</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>其决問起牠的工作興趣，……同事感情和廠中的待遇。她想了一想，也有頭有緒地道來：「我在製罐部的包裝股，每晨七時上工，至十二時，下午二時至五時半，夜工二三小時，這樣一天到夜的做工，吃飯，休息，睡覺，今天做完，明天再做，人好比機器一樣。要說苦樂，到也不甚覺得，我想要吃飯，先要錢，要錢先得做工，我們是苦人，家無恒產，靠兩隻手，做一天吃一天，做慣了也不覺其苦，我想只有心平氣和，靠自己的勞力，求個人的生存，否則天下那會太平呢！本廠女工有百餘人，天天同進同出，但廠規不許在工作時講話，所以大家面熟而不大說話，每星期六開全體大會，合全廠四百工友於一堂，聽總經理的訓話，此外很少聯絡。我對於一般女工的意見，可以分作兩方面說：（一）有的眼快手快，出貨迅速，（二）有的講究淸潔，身强力壯；（三）有的做人穩健，不要人家管理。但是好人少，壞人多，我最不贊成的，如（一）工作偷懶，不聽旁人勸導，（二）不定心做事，還要妨礙別人；（三）衣幅污穢，體弱多病。廠中待我們很好，譬如女工生產，先向人事部登記，入指定的醫院，費用由廠供給，產前產後各休假一月，工資照給，疾病時也照此辦理。平心而論，可算優待的了。」</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>最後問她小時讀過幾年書，…怎樣纔能滿足你的人生？這幾點，她表示很悲哀：「只怪父母太溺愛我了，讀了一年多書，夠什麼用，我那鄉間離十多里路纔有學校，來去也太遠了。到今朝，不會讀書看報，眞是開眼瞎子，大概女工們識字的，僅十之二三，小時不讀書，老來吃盡苦。講到我的生活呢，並沒有不滿足的地方，　自力謀生，是天下最自由最光明的人，我也不平空夢想，但願撫兒成人，多讀書，勤學問，有了高強的本領，做些出人頭地的事業，總不要像他的母親，在這裏挨苦就行了。」</p>

<p>— 曼玲黃</p>
<p>我的朋友，在一家廠裏做事，他們有兩個孩子，一個老媽子，他的妻子極能幹，家裏粗細事情都能自己去幹，我把她的工作寫些出來，給女同胞們參考參考，能不以我稱她「標準」為過分吧？</p>
<p>每天六時以前，在她丈夫及孩子都熟睡時，她就悄悄的起來了。這時候就呌起老媽子，生火煮粥，一方面自己先行梳洗，然後幫同老媽子楷掃房屋，七時兩個孩子起來，就替他們洗臉，整理書籍，一方面逐件事教導他們自己應當怎樣做，同時命老媽子預備粥菜給孩子吃粥，八時老媽子送孩子們上學去了。她的丈夫喜睡，不到八時一刻是不起身的，在孩子及僕人都離家後，她就預備丈夫起來應用的東西，好像襯衫襪子手帕等東西，都一件一件的放在床側，洗臉水提好在洗臉　旁，在丈夫洗臉時，她己經去預備早餐了。八時三刻，丈夫去辦公，老媽子回來了，那麼她就上菜塲，臨走總是可囑老媽子洗地板，十一時半以前帮着切菜煮菜，到十一時四十分，已經預備好孩子們的飯菜，老媽子送飯去了，她的丈夫總是十二時一刻回來，午餐時當然由她去料理了。飯後和她丈夫看報談天，二時她丈夫又到廠裏去，她就開始縫紉或熨衣服，這時候老媽子洗衣服，三時半仍由老媽子接孩子回家，她就做些點心給他們吃，四時半到六時監督孩子溫書，六時一刻她丈夫歸家了。七時晚餐，晚餐後，她看看雜誌小說，或是寫信，記日用賬，她丈夫到鄰家走走談天，九時睡覺，不過因為上海環境腐敗，她丈失不免有時要逛逛舞塲，她見到這種需要，所以學着也會跳　她在可能範圍中，也到社會上做事，她有遠大的眼光，聰明的腦子，能按環境而治家，照時代而教子，沒有絲毫上海少奶奶的習氣，關於家裏的事，從不要她丈夫費一些心，就是他的收入不豐，也能處之泰然，除了他丈夫的西裝及襯衫，自己的綢旗袍以外，都是靠她兩隻手，她有透澈的人生觀，她有相當的學識，她有和藹的態度，她有耐勞的精神，「標準妻子」四字，眞可以當之無愧</p>

<p>牛乳　一磅（500c·c）</p>
<p>糖5·％其中一半是水（1/5磅100cc·或三兩　　水　在糖內</p>
<p>乳酸　四十五至六十滴　　（若須多者，側比例增加，若用不着如此多，則比例減少。）</p>
<p>（注意）做此類乳，不能用鐵鉛類器具，因能與乳酸起化學作用，滴乳酸的一手宜慢，調乳的一手宜速，如此使滴下去的乳酸，不及凝結牛乳內的蛋白質而成塊狀。</p>
<p>代乳粉的配置</p>
<p>以代乳粉代人乳，其缺點較新鮮牛乳更多。因牛乳經熱與壓力弄乾成粉後，其中的一種維生素，卽被消滅。代乳粉的種類繁多，許多做母親者，誤信商人的宣傳話頭，以為如此安全，樂得去用，那是最危險的。代乳粉，於母體有特殊疾病，而住處又不易得新鮮牛乳者，用之亦未始不可。其分劑可依各類代乳粉之說明書上。但在每决哺乳，須加橘子汁，或番茄汁十幾個西西（C·C·），茶湯亦可用。</p>
<p>哺喂法</p>
<p>乳瓶宜用圓而無凹角的，以便洗滌，禁用皮管接連等瓶，乳頭上孔，不宜太大，免乳入兒口太快。每决哺後，乳瓶及乳頭都必須洗淨煮沸保藏好，乳之溫度宜合適，每决哺前，可將乳滴一點在成人手背上，試共溫度之合適吾。哺時，乳宜向乳頭，以免空氣哺入嬰兒之胃，哺完，可抱起嬰兒，使嬰兒頭放在大人肩上，一手抱住，一手輕輕拍之，使已入胃之空氣吐出，免在胃內漲得難受。照上法，每日哺六次或五次（半夜一次因睡眠可酌量免除），每四小時一次，乳量之多少該依嬰兒之大小而定，稍大後，當另加別種含有維生素的食料。</p>
<h3 id="c237">隆德坊 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 茵</p>
<p>許多時候不到南市那邊去了，五年前隆德坊的一番經歷，巳像藏得年代過久的照片一樣地漸漸淡下去了。當初我們把整個家庭寄托在裏面的三十四號的房屋，現在不知又讓誰住著了。人真是最活動的東西！</p>
<p>不到半個月前，無非也是為著家裏幾個孩子的事情，居然一個人獨自穿過了新北門，踏進九畝地，街上的景物，多少總還存留着幾分相熟的踪跡，使我不由不起了一種很誠摯的故舊之情，於是就在辦定正事之後，特地兜一個圈子，灣到隆德坊去。</p>
<p>紅色的牆磚已漸漸地退成淡黃色了，漆的弄堂門也剝蝕得像繳花子穿的百衲衣一樣了，弄口的小店和修鞋子攤也換了新的人在活動了；祇剩那看弄堂的江北人倒依舊沒有走。</p>
<p>我的目標原想探望探望三十五號裏的一位老鄰居，那個臉色老是很黃瘦，却又很和氣，很愛看書的蘇州少婦；但我還不曾走到三十五號門前，那看弄堂　江北人已拉着嗓子喊道「李家早搬掉了！」</p>
<p>搬塲原是很普通的事情，當然是沒有什麼詫異的，可是那多說話的江北人却又接着自動把他家所以搬塲的原由說給了我聽，頓時使我感覺到無限的心酸。</p>
<p>李家本不是有產階級，他們的生活全仗李先生一個人在電報局裏的收入；可是他們還有幾個親戚同住着，大家都很歡喜熱鬧，請酒打牌，往往非常闊綽，眞像是很過得去的。祗有那李家沙奶：却還有些頭腦，常常背着他們，告訴我經濟很窘，並且絕對痛惡這種闊排塲。無奈伊的丈夫不肯聽伊的話，一味胡鬧下去，這人本來是有肺病，再加上日夜的胡鬧，病象便日深，終於在一年前吐血死了，那些親戚見沒了依靠，便各自散了，丟下李家少奶：帶着兩個很小的小孩子冷淸淸地回到鄉下去。據那江北人說，回去的盤費還是賣掉了許多東西才成行的；那幾個孩子是瘦得剩了一把骨頭，看情形是也也像上了小癆病，不能多活的了。</p>
<p>我走出隆德坊時，耳朶裏却還像聽見李家的打牌的聲音。</p>

<h3 id="c238">救濟失業靑年問題 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>知識靑年的失業問題，至現在已達到一個嚴重的階段。每年全國各學校畢業生，除却少部份有工作可做，共餘大多數人，都遭「畢業卽失業」之苦。這結果，不但靑年自身，要感到煩悶，卽社會也漸呈不安之象。近來北平各大學畢業生組織「服務運動大同盟，」舉行請願，允足以表示這問題的嚴重性。</p>
<p>為要應付當前的重大問題。當局對於救濟失業靑年，曾想出各種的方法，以資解决。頃行政院已决定盡量甄用專科以上及中等學校畢業生辦法：（一）由院咨商考試院，按年舉行高考一次，並請酌予變通待遇，（二）由政府於中央政治學校內，舉辦專科以上學校，近年畢業生之尚未就業者，加以短期訓練。及實習，期滿後酌加考驗，由政府設法助其就業，（三）二十五年度內義務教育及民衆教育，推廣工作所需要之師資及指導員，至少在五萬人以上，其大部份擬就初高中及初高級師範畢業生之尚未就業者，甄別訓練派充，這些辦法，果能一一實行起來，知識靑年的失業問題，卽不能全部解决，至少也可以得到一部份的救濟。</p>
<p>惟對於當局採行甄用畢業生辦法，我們還有一點意見。按年舉行高考一次，這自然是選拔人才的方法。但高考過去已曾舉行，聞一班及格的，到現在，尚有許多未有職業。所以當局舉行高考固要緊，盡量安挿及格者’尤為必要。否則只給頭銜，不給工作，仍有失救濟失業的意義。一紙證書，是不能當飯吃的。</p>
<p>其决，訓練畢業生，當局已成立專科以上學校畢業生就業訓導班籌備委員會，進行一切。訓練期間，規定為六個月。實習期間，現定為三個月至六個月。受訓期內，每人津貼三十元。實習期內，每人津貼四十元。這措施都是合宜的，然關於學員名額，只限定近三年度，各學校現未就業的畢業生一千人，人數實嫌太小。且三年以前畢業的，就無機會受訓練，救濟也屬不公平。我們希望當局盡可能的範圍內，設法擴充訓練班，俾多數失業畢業生，有受訓就業的機會。</p>
<p>不過解决知識靑年的失業問題，並不是一件易事。甄用畢業生，只是暫時的補救方法。要進一步的救濟，還須從改良現行的教育制度着手。蓋今日畢業生的失業，社會經濟的衰落，固為一大原因，但教育制度的缺陷，也有以使然。先日教部長報告，失業靑年，學習實科者，少於學習其他各科。這一點，願當局有以改善之。至北平各大學畢業生服務運動大同盟，曾提出建議：（一）改革教育制度，（二）改良考試制度，（三）改良地方行政人員任用標準，（四）教師國有制度，（五）平均薪給，（六）厲行銓敘及考績制度，也是救濟失業的辦法，希望當局加以採納。</p>
<h3 id="c239">命運 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭明子</p>
<p>（命運像一口無邊深的井陷，在夜之世界裏，黑黝黝地張開了怕人的大口，彷彿在獰笑中含着勝利的驕傲似的，在期待着失足的行旅人！</p>
<p>於是，又一個尋常的靈魂，在靑靑的年齡中，悄悄地，沈到命運的黑而幽深的洞穴中去了。</p>
<p>在那裏，是沒有空氣，沒有淸水，沒有陽光的。人茫然地摸索着，探求着，到老，到死亡……），</p>
<p>悠久地想起來，住到這僻遠而荒寂的小村子裏來，也有好些時候了了；年成壞，白天聽着外邊村人們的不快意的口角與毆打，這已經成為尋常的事了；到晚來在籌思的不眠中，聽着遠遠的梆子聲中夾雜着一些隱隱地哭聲，到第二天，便聽得說有那家的丈夫或女人為了借不到米跳了井或是上了吊！這些，也已經習見得失掉了鬨動人的資格了。人誰都把它當作一種尋常的瑣事：聽一聽，縐一縐眉，便丟開不再去談論它，很快地便毫不在意的完全忘掉了。村中的人便這樣地一天一天的去掉？平凡得同拂去一顆灰塵一樣。</p>
<p>為了這，當聽了女人說過沒了米，而可當的東西也沒有了的時候，我們便都不的而同地想起了門前的那條流着濁水的小河，與足以吊得死人的那些高而堅實的樹枝了。</p>
<p>（兇險的，不祥而可怕的想頭啊！</p>
<p>那麽想着，便更覺得怕起來了：墮在命運之陷阱中的人該是永沒有超生的希望了吧？命運是殘酷的…可是，命運！它究竟是什麼東西呢？</p>
<p>也許不是註就把生活攬得那麽破殘的吧？在學校里的當兒，不也是高興活潑的少年人嗎？於是，當三年的流浪把人融成了一堆破片似的衰敗，於是，倒着頭，便生活在這冷僻的所在來了。</p>
<p>可是，一切都是同樣的糟啊！生活的破片已經無法縫補起來！卽使年來僅僅地接到了相識者的一點不足輕重的消息，也會很快的想起外面的廣大的世界，與浮遊在這廣大的世界中的命運了。</p>
<p>「再到外面的世界中去試着找一點活下去的機會吧！」那嗎想，便不管有沒有把握，也不管女人底猶豫，連那點不值錢的傢具也去典了錢；為了找相識的人，得把臉裝得好看一點，得把典押來的錢去備一點痛心的贈物！就僅僅是為了活下去也好，再去試一試命運的手段吧？</p>
<p>一種凄愴的心情浮上來了，女子與孩子帶在身邊，像出征的戰士，也像流亡的乞丐，在什麽書上看到過的句子，又深深地打進記憶中來了；</p>
<p>「近日廚中乏短供，嬰兒啼哭飯籮空；母因附耳和兒語：爹有新詩謁相公！」</p>
<p>（淸楚地，一種悲劇存在在人世間，像霉薰的苔毛：人是得用自己底眼淚來供人笑樂的啊！）</p>
<p>為了這，便忘掉了過去的被命運所作弄的故事，忘掉了自己的眼淚，便在毫無把握的中間，茫然地把自己和兩個生命，投到不可知的命運的掌握中去了。（這世界，有什麼是可知的呢？）</p>
<p>一條水，一艘航船，一席統艙的鋪位，這樣，就載着一些無定的生命，向更大的不可知的命迅駛去了。眼淚是需要留着去換人家的歡笑的（眞不敢往下想了！），而人家底歡笑又將是自己們底命運的主宰的……</p>
<p>一切全沒有着落啊：迷迷茫茫的，在人底嘈雜聲中，看到灰色的陸地了，帶着女人與孩子，擠在一羣與自己有着同樣徬徨的人堆裏踏上了岸，那兒，據說是都會了！都會的路是多漂亮的哪：</p>

<p>— 以一</p>
<p>一直到太陽落了下去，大個子才慢吞吞的，有氣無力的，拖着疲倦的步子轉回家來；及至到了家門口，他可就停住了，他被苦惱糾纏住自己，他沒有勇氣去推那屬虛掩着的門柵。</p>
<p>他，眉頭緊緊地結在一起，在暮色的蒼茫中他那被飢餓所苦了的瘦削的臉更蒼白得怕人了，深陷的眼睛，遲鈍的凝視着什麼，緊縮的胸部也在劇烈的起伏着——肋骨就像是要突破那一層薄薄地皮肉。他急促的喘息着，乏力的擇動着四肢，他疲憊了，他被一天的奔波來疲憊了。他把半個身子來倚着那剝落了的牆壁，他要抓往個暫時的休息，他在回想，回想這一天的痛苦的遭遇。</p>
<p>『我沒有親戚，朋友！我……』</p>
<p>突然的，大個子把拳頭打着士坯的牆嘶裂的呌起來了，這呌囂驚醒了病在屋裏的老婆那個就又起了一陣劇烈的乾嗽，連粗喘的聲音在外邊也都聽得見了，大個子像是記起了一件什麽事情，他推開了牆壁，他把房門猛地一下子推開來，他趕進去。</p>
<p>『怎麽樣呵……大個子……』老婆用輕微乏力但是含着大量的希望的聲調向他問着。</p>
<p>那個一聲也沒嚮。</p>
<p>老婆又是一陣咳嗽。</p>
<p>『你他媽的活着幹什麼？你…你，活着，活着，……你媽的，你…』大個子像是一匹瘋狂了的野獸，一下子奔到老婆的床前，一手　住老婆的頭髮提了起來，那一隻手可就照着老婆身上揍開了。</p>
<p>那個只成了喘息和咳嗽了，她並不抗拒，任憑大個子打着，她幾次的張了張嘴想說什麽，但是為了挨打的原故　不出來了。</p>
<p>「你媽的，為了你我才受窮，受氣！你，你，你快點死吧，你，你媽的！……』大個子的拳頭往老婆身上落着，落着，那個仍然是忍受着一聲不響的倒在大個子懷裏，末了大個子沒有力氣再打下去了，他停住了手，他眼睛裏落着淚，他突然抽噎的哭了，他緊緊的把老婆抱起來，他咱着她，那個苦澀的笑了，她伸出了乾癟的手替大個子抹着淚。</p>
<p>『打吧，大個子！……我，我不恨你，我恨我自己累了你，我，……我願意你打死我……』老婆也哭了。</p>
<p>『不，我錯了，我不該打你，你有病，……』大個子的淚流在老婆的臉上『我生氣，我生氣那些混蛋東西，他他們不是人！……』</p>
<p>『怎麽？……你也沒到東家那兒去嗎？……』</p>
<p>『去過的，我說好話，哀求他，求他借點錢吃飯和給你治病，……他不肯，……我跪下磕頭他也不肯，……沒良心！……以前我是給他出過力的，他全不想了，我說早晚要還的，他只是咬着牙根，一毛不拔，末了呌人把我拖出來了！……他媽的！……畜類！……我還被他們踢了幾脚哩！……我生氣，我？……』</p>
<p>『咳！……我死了就好了，累了你，我難過，……大個子！……』</p>
<p>『你不能死！你，……我要想辦法，我……』他伸出瘦削的手，很有把握似的。</p>
<p>但是「辦法」沒有從窗外飛進來；也沒有從門外跳進來，大個子的揮着，掉着，慢慢地掛了下來。他望着窗外，是一片黑暗。</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangzhou situation shifted on the 7th, with hope for a peaceful resolution. Chen Jitang made two requests to the central government: first, that all troops be nationalized, and second, that the military reclamation bureau be retained. The telegram is being drafted and can be sent on the 18th. Chen Jitang spent the entire day of the 17th at Li Zongren's residence. At 8 p.m., he took a special car to Hong Kong. Another account says he took the last express train at 5:10 p.m., but because he rode in a third-class carriage, few knew about it. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The two parts of the Second and Third Armies of Guangdong are greatly disintegrating. Chen Jitang is very alarmed. He convened an emergency meeting on the night of the 16th. Zhang Da first stated that he personally could not command the Second Army, and said that if war was insisted upon, the entire Guangdong army would be lost. He spoke with tears in his eyes. Chen Jitang turned pale upon hearing this. Li Zongren and others were also speechless. After a long time, Chen Jitang finally expressed his decision to issue a telegram resigning from his post, but Li Zongren and others firmly opposed it. According to another source, Chen Jitang, seeing that the overall situation was unfavorable, decided to transfer his elite core divisions to retreat and gather in the Gaozhou, Leizhou, and Qiongya areas in the southern region.

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Supervisory Committee, learning that Xiao Focheng had left Guangdong for Hong Kong, sent a special telegram inviting him to enter Beijing to participate in the committee's affairs. The original telegram stated: "Hong Kong sends word of Supervisory Committee Member Xiao Focheng's arrival. We have just learned that you have left Guangdong for Hong Kong. We are extremely pleased. We respectfully request that you come to Beijing immediately to participate in the committee's affairs. We are eagerly awaiting your arrival." (Signed) Central Supervisory Committee (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang sent a telegram to Xiao Focheng on the 17th, inviting him to Beijing. The original telegram is as follows: "Hong Kong Supervisory Committee Member Xiao Focheng: We have heard of your arrival in Hong Kong and are deeply gratified. We trust that you have recovered your health. Central affairs are awaiting the guidance of experienced elders. All comrades are hoping that you will come to Beijing soon. Zhongzheng is especially eager to receive your instructions in person. We earnestly hope that you will come north immediately to satisfy our longing, and we also request a telegram in response." (Signed) Chiang Zhongzheng (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Chaojun and Liang Hancao jointly sent a telegram to Xiao Focheng and Chen Rong on the 17th. The original telegram stated: "Hong Kong conveys word of Supervisory Committee Member Xiao Focheng and Elder Chen Xiezhi's arrival. We have long missed your exemplary conduct and are deeply concerned. We recently heard that you, along with Comrade Bonan, left for Hong Kong in anger because you did not accept the decisions of the full committee and deployed troops in defiance of orders. Your integrity is admirable. We greatly admire you. Now that Bonan is deserted by his followers and destined to fail, we hope that you can find a way to eliminate this great disaster, considering the well-being of our fellow villagers and the nation's vitality. Comrades here are hoping that you will offer loyal advice again to urge him to realize the error of his ways, or that you will come north to discuss the overall situation. We hope that you will agree to this. We are sending this telegram specifically to await your instructions." (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) News of the Second Army's opposition to fighting and the wavering of a part of the Third Army reached Guangzhou on the afternoon of the 16th. Chen Jitang and Li Zongren were extremely shocked. Lin Yunheng and Liu Jiwen, upon hearing the news, believed that the situation was hopeless. They immediately decided to secretly leave the province, no longer serving as Chen Jitang's puppets. They then went to Shameen in disguise with He Qifeng, the director of the construction department, and boarded a British ship to Hong Kong, arriving on the 17th. They also visited Xiao Focheng, intending to jointly issue a telegram expressing their feelings. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hankou) On the 15th, the Guangdong army destroyed the Tiantoushui and Jiufeng steel bridges on the southern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and cut off the electric wires in the Pingshi and Luojiadu areas. The Hankou authorities confirmed this on the evening of the 16th through the third section of the Zhushao project, indicating that the Guangdong situation is becoming tense again. The northern section is peaceful from self-defense to Hankou. (17th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) A large number of Guangdong officials' families continued to move to Hong Kong on the 17th. (1st Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Xiamen) The Huang Renhuan unit of the Fourth Guangdong Army is now concentrated in Meixian, Sanhe, and Fengshun, to defend Chaozhou. Only a small portion remains in Dabu. The central army is still guarding the Fujian border. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Guangdong Currency Suddenly Rises <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangdong currency rebounded several points on the 17th due to rumors that Chen Jitang was going abroad. However, this claim has not been confirmed. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang sent personnel to the Bank of China to check on customs duty deposits. However, the bank remitted the daily tax revenue to Shameen, so it was not withdrawn. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Today, the price of Guangdong paper currency in foreign countries is rumored to have a peaceful resolution to the Southwest situation, so it suddenly presented an unprecedented rise. The opening price was 19.950 yuan in Guangdong currency, equivalent to 1,000 Hong Kong dollars. Within a day, it rose by 210 points, and the closing price for Guangdong currency was 1.720 yuan, equivalent to 1,000 Hong Kong dollars. The news regarding the arrival of Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai, leaders of the former 19th Route Army, in Guangzhou seems premature. Currently, Jiang and Cai are still in Hong Kong. The Southwest authorities have officially sent telegrams inviting them to come and participate in the anti-Japanese military efforts. They are expected to arrive here tomorrow. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Financial circles here believe that after the central government completes unification, it will maintain the Guangdong currency. Therefore, the Guangdong currency had already risen at the closing of the market on the morning of the 17th, to 1,923 yuan per 1,000 Hong Kong dollars. In the afternoon, it continued to rise sharply, with 1,000 Hong Kong dollars only exchanging for 1,835 yuan. At the close of the market, there was still a trend of continued rise. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The Southwest Political Affairs Committee issued a statement today, approving the free circulation of Guangxi currency in Guangdong Province and declaring that the payment of various taxes in Guangxi currency is also legal. (17th Allied Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) With war about to break out, refugees from various places are flocking to Guangzhou to take refuge. Passenger and freight trains on the Guangdong-Hankou line have been suspended since the morning of the 16th. The air of war permeates the city. Citizens are rushing to buy Hong Kong dollars for the purpose of seeking refuge in Hong Kong. The decline of the Guangdong currency is becoming more severe, with ten Hong Kong dollars exchanging for nineteen yuan and one dime in Guangdong currency. Large-scale transactions have completely stopped. (17th Allied Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Guangdong decided to abandon Chaozhou and Shantou. The Zeng Youren and Yan Yingyu divisions were transferred from the Fujian-Guangdong border to Heyuan. The Chen Hanguang Division was transferred from Jieyang to Zijin and Danshui. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang convened a military meeting at 9 p.m. on the 16th, deciding to strengthen the defenses along the Dongjiang line from Huizhou to Guangzhou and the Beijiang line from Juntian to Guangzhou, concentrate forces, and implement linear warfare. On the afternoon of the 17th, the Twelve Divisions, the Chen Hanguang unit of the garrison army, and the Chen Weizhou unit retreated from the Dongjiang and gathered in Guangzhou to defend the urban area. Zhang Da, commander of the Second Army, and Chen Zhang of the Fourteenth Division departed for Juntian New Street. Huang Renhuan, commander of the Fourth Army, and Huang Yanzhen, deputy commander of the Second Army, departed for Huizhou to deploy military affairs. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The 25th Regiment of the 9th Division, Li Shaojia, the 26th Regiment, Liu Zhenxiang, and the three regiments of the Training Corps, Wang Dequan, of the Third Army, opposed Chen Jitang's actions and obeyed the central government. They departed from Wuhua on the 16th and surrendered to the Fourth Route Army. Ouyang Xin, commander of the 9th Division, deserted from the army. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Second Guangdong Army began withdrawing from Shaonan on the evening of the 15th in a very disheveled state. They did not even have time to take their luggage. The Shaoguan Chamber of Commerce immediately telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Yu, requesting that troops be sent to maintain local security. The Mo Xide and Ye Zhao units of the First Division arrived in Shaozhou on the 16th and issued proclamations to reassure the people. The hearts of the people in Shaozhou are now stable, and order is as usual. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Zhang Da, commander of the Second Guangdong Army, has now abandoned Yingde and retreated to a certain place only forty miles from Juntian. Juntian is about thirty miles north of Guangzhou. Chen Jitang originally considered Yingde as a line of defense. The retreat of the Guangdong army will leave the Guangxi army alone to face Yu Hanmou's troops. Yu's troops are advancing from the Jiangxi border towards Guangdong and have now occupied the outskirts of Shaoguan, forty miles north of Yingde. A large number of pillar troops are coming to Guangzhou from Guangxi by boat and immediately boarding trains to be sent north on the Guangshao Railway. The Guangshao Railway is now exclusively for military use. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Zhang Da's Second Army has now abandoned Yingde and retreated to Juntian, thirty miles from the provincial capital. The Guangxi army's advance has not stopped, or it is exchanging information near Yingde to plan a military conflict. (17th Allied Press Dispatch)</p>

Bai Chongxi, Li Pinxian, chief of staff of the Fourth Army Group, Wang Zhibin, commander of the Fourth Division, and others attended. They discussed the deployments for establishing the headquarters of the Combined Armies and the specific strategies for the armies of Guangdong and Guangxi. They then decided to appoint Zhang Da, commander of the Second Army, as the commander-in-chief of the northern route, Huang Yanzhen, deputy commander of the Third Army, as the commander-in-chief of the central route, and Huang Renhuan, commander of the Fourth Army, as the commander-in-chief of the eastern route. The fortresses on the eastern half have been in a state of wartime alert since the 15th. In the three rivers of the east, west, and north, many small steamers, civilian boats, and laborers have been requisitioned in recent days, causing unrest among the people. (17th Allied Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) At the military meeting on the afternoon of the 16th, the joint battle line of the Guangdong and Guangxi armies was discussed in detail. At that time, Li Zongren said that, if necessary, the Fourth Army Group should abandon Guangxi Province, with the militia and police force responsible for maintaining security, and then take full responsibility for defending Guangdong Province. It is also reported that 20,000 Guangxi troops have arrived in the Beijiang area. (17th Allied Press Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Chairman Chiang Telegraphed Chen Jitang Again; Preserve Revolutionary History, Retire Immediately, Come to Beijing as Soon as Possible; A Soldier's Success or Failure, Honor or Disgrace, Does Not Depend on Temporary Advancement or Retreat <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang sent a telegram to Chen Jitang on the 17th. The original text is as follows: "(Most Urgent) Guangzhou Committee Member Chen Bonan: I already read your telegraph on the tenth, and I thought my earnest words would be accepted. However, according to reports, you and others have refused to accept the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session and are planning to convene an extraordinary meeting to establish a separate military government. I dare not fully believe the truth of this news. I suspect that my previous telegram was too brief, causing you to be misled by others and to misunderstand the central government's painstaking efforts and my consistent intention to protect you. For the sake of both the public and private interests, I cannot help but say another word to you. Throughout this Guangdong incident, the central government has consistently adhered to the principle of considering both discipline and feelings, aiming to bring it back on the right track. My sincerity lies in preserving the history of our revolutionary comrades-in-arms. Therefore, on the one hand, I asked you to leave Guangdong, so that you could extricate yourself from the thorns, and on the other hand, I still transferred you to Beijing to jointly bear the heavy responsibility of national defense. It is because we have shared hardships in the past that we must jointly preserve the beginning and the end. Loving people with virtue is what is right, and I firmly believe that you will be able to discern this intention and plan accordingly. Since the revolution, there has been no shortage of soldiers in Guangdong who have made brilliant achievements. But often due to a single wrong thought, they failed to maintain their good name in the end. In the past, the Premier entrusted Chen Jingcun with important responsibilities, but Jingcun eventually rebelled in fear. Even after his death, he is still deeply mourned by his comrades. Later, our party, with the responsibility of maintaining the revolutionary base, hoped that Chen Zhenru and you would work together with one heart, but Zhenru was not content with his position and harbored ambitions. He eventually launched a rebellion in Fujian, destroying the party and betraying the country, resulting in the loss of his reputation and nowhere to return. Their reckless and misguided actions ultimately led to nothing, and they left a great stain on the revolutionary history of Guangdong. Whenever I think of the past, I cannot help but feel apprehensive for historical soldiers in Guangdong like you. Therefore, since the beginning of the incident, I have always been concerned with preserving your revolutionary history. Asking you to leave Guangdong and come to Beijing is entirely out of my sincere desire to protect you, not wanting you to follow in the footsteps of Chen Jingcun and Chen Zhenru, leading to self-destruction, disgrace, and harm to both public and private interests. To put it bluntly, it is precisely because I hope that you can occupy a permanently glorious position in revolutionary history that I advise you to retire immediately. The success or failure, honor or disgrace, of us soldiers does not depend on temporary advancement or retreat, but on obedience to orders and the integrity of our own actions. For the past ten years, I have adhered to this principle. I advance when the party orders me to advance, and I retreat when the party orders me to retreat, without any hesitation or evasion. I hope that you can also deeply understand that this is the minimum condition that revolutionary soldiers should abide by, and encourage each other to avoid regret. Then, your honorable retirement today will be the foundation for your future efforts to serve the party and the country, and there is no need to ruin your infinite future due to temporary impulses. Now, is it better for you to end up like Jingcun and Zhenru, abandoning yourself, destroying yourself, and disgracing yourself, or to adhere to the duty of obedience of a revolutionary soldier and have a bright future of advancement and retreat? If you think calmly, you will surely accept the goodwill of the central government without any hesitation. The party and the country are in dire straits, and the people of Guangdong are in fear and pain. Your personal gains and losses, blessings and misfortunes in the future history also depend on this single thought. Whether for Guangdong, for the country, for the public, or for the private interests, you should retire bravely, protect yourself from beginning to end, and not be far from returning to what is right, which is praised by the wise. I have poured out my heart, all out of the sincere desire to protect comrades-in-arms. I earnestly hope that you will think deeply about my humble words and come to Beijing as soon as possible, lest those who are close to you be heartbroken and disappointed. I also hope for a telegram in response." (Signed) Zhongzheng, Xiaochen (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e14">Shadows in Optimistic Psychology <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The resolutions and declarations of this Second Plenary Session, together with the earnest speeches by President Chiang and Foreign Minister Zhang regarding foreign policy, have caused the general public, who have been depressed for a long time, to develop some optimistic psychology regarding the future of the country. First, the plenary session passed the motion proposed by the Southwest Central Committee members Tang Shaoyi and others to abolish the two Southwest organizations, and reappointed the military and political authorities responsible for the two Guang provinces. From now on, as long as the central government further strengthens, our country can complete a truly unified situation. Second, the determination to resist foreign aggression expressed by the plenary session is clearer and more thorough than that of the Fifth National Congress. The central government's firm diplomatic policy over the past year, as well as the increased centripetal force of the military leaders of various provinces, have indeed suppressed the arrogance of the aggressors. In the future, if the national military and civilians' will to save the country is truly unified, then the goal of restoring national rights will not be difficult to achieve. Third, the central government is not pursuing responsibility for the changes in the two Guang provinces. Li Bai is still entrusted with important responsibilities, and Chen Jitang has only been replaced with a suitable position due to being deserted by his followers. As for the unification of government and military orders, it is a fundamental condition for saving the country and resisting foreign aggression. Since the central government only requires this point, the military leaders of the two Guang provinces, who have been influenced by revolutionary ideas, will of course be able to humbly accept it.</p>
<p>However, the news coming from the two Guang provinces in recent days cannot help but cast a shadow on our optimistic psychology. Chen, Li, Bai, and others have already issued a declaration, advocating convening an extraordinary meeting of the Central Executive Committee in Guangzhou to overthrow the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session. At the same time, they are calling themselves the commander-in-chief and deputy commander of the Allied Forces, actively preparing for war. This kind of behavior, which destroys more than it achieves, is clearly only "painful to relatives and pleasing to enemies." Because in terms of legal theory, since the Second Plenary Session was held in accordance with the party constitution and with the attendance of a majority of Central Committee members, even if Chen, Li, Bai, and others use extremely clever sophistry in writing, they cannot deny its legitimacy. In terms of pros and cons, during this period of serious national crisis, the uniformity of national salvation measures is absolutely necessary. Now, Chen, Li, Bai, and others, relying on temporary impulses, are setting up separate banners to oppose the appropriate and practical measures clearly indicated by the central government. Will this not cause local wars and bring about unexpected foreign aggression? As for ending up in disgrace due to losing the sympathy of the people, it goes without saying. However, they all have a revolutionary history. At the final juncture, they may break free from stubborn prejudices and illusions, and take into account the safety of the overall situation, eliminating the scourge of war invisibly. This is the most urgent hope of the national public today.</p>
<h3 id="e15">The British Government Focuses on the Far East: Newly Appointed Ambassador to China to Arrive Early Next Month; Now Carefully Studying Chinese Characters to Promote Sino-British-Japanese Cooperation <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(London) Sir Hughe Montgomery Knatchbull-Hugessen, the newly appointed British Ambassador to China, originally planned to visit his old post in Iran before heading to the Far East. However, due to the government's urgent desire for Sir Hughe to arrive in China, this trip has been cancelled. Sir Hughe is scheduled to sail across the Atlantic on the Canadian Empress on August 4th with his wife, one son, and two daughters, taking the route via Canada to the Far East. After arriving in Japan on September 5th, he will stay for a short period of four or five days before proceeding directly to Shanghai. His family will then travel to Peiping. Since assuming his new position, Sir Hughe has extensively interacted with Chinese and foreign individuals with connections to China. He is known for his competence and familiarity with various Far Eastern issues, and has already made an excellent impression here. Sir Hughe has always lived up to expectations wherever he goes and is respected for his talent. There is no doubt that he will be highly praised in his new role. The fact that Sir Hughe has been appointed as Ambassador to China and that his predecessor, Sir Alexander Cadogan, has been promoted to a higher position demonstrates the British government's concern for Far Eastern affairs. Knowledgeable observers hope that Sir Hughe's assignment to China will usher in a new era in Far Eastern affairs, with the primary goal of satisfying China, Britain, and Japan. Today, a Reuters reporter visited Sir Hughe, who was practicing Chinese calligraphy. Since assuming his new position, he has hired a Chinese teacher to study. Sir Hughe declined to comment on Far Eastern issues, stating that it was difficult to have any opinions before taking office. "A personal observation of twenty-four hours can reveal a difference in the facts," he said. Sir Hughe also said that he has high hopes for his new position. According to Reuters sources, Britain has no intention of closing its embassy in Peiping. After Sir Hughe's arrival, he will establish a general office in Nanking, but he will also reside in Peiping occasionally. The old embassy will be fully maintained, according to the report.

The board of directors requested that regardless of who purchases the factory, a contract must be signed guaranteeing that the employees will not be replaced for three months and the workers for six months. Therefore, the buyers are currently in negotiations. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) According to the Tianjin office of the Jinpu Railway, the railway was ordered three years ago to take custody of the documents and assets of the Cangshi Railway.

<h3 id="e30">Japanese Police in the Puppet State Abuse Indians; Britain Files Another Protest; Matters Involve Extraterritoriality <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the case of Indian jewelers Mr. and Mrs. Hussain being abused by Japanese police in a Changchun city prison in "Manchukuo," responsible sources here have revealed that the Foreign Office has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese Ambassador Yoshida. According to reports, Japanese police arrested Mr. and Mrs. Hussain on the 17th of last month under the pretext of owing money to merchants in "Manchukuo," and then released them after deeming them innocent. While in prison, Mr. and Mrs. Hussain were subjected to "third-degree water torture." The British government believes that its citizens residing in "Manchukuo" should enjoy extraterritorial rights, and this case should have been handed over to the local British consul for handling. The actions of the Japanese police are illegal, and the British ambassador to Japan, Clive, has been instructed to protest to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Moreover, this is not the first time that Japanese police have abused foreigners. In October and November of last year, several Chinese employees of British hospitals and businesses were arrested on suspicion of being communists, and one of them died as a result of severe abuse.

There were no concrete negotiations on Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Major General Matsumuro, head of the Japanese North China Garrison Special Service Agency, stated today in a discussion with foreign journalists on the China issue that Japan's goal in North China is to assist the Chinese in building an honest and capable government. He personally opposes purely military administrative organs. When asked whether the current government of North China welcomes Japanese cooperation in economic development, Matsumuro replied that some officials here support it, while others oppose it. However, the Japanese hope to persuade the Chinese authorities to understand that this cooperation is in the interest of the Chinese people. Someone also raised the question of whether Japan wants to make North China and Mongolia a buffer zone between Japan and Russia. Matsumuro replied that Japan's strength is sufficient to deal with Soviet Russia directly and does not need the assistance of a buffer zone. (Reuters Dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The water level of the Yongding River is still rising sharply. The flood control gate in the Zhonghong dredging area has not been raised, causing the water to force its way into the new diversion channel in Tianjin County. Dozens of villages such as Zhao Family Village and Liu An Village in the north of the county are very close to the river and are in immediate danger. On the 17th, the villagers petitioned Tianjin County, begging for materials to urgently build defenses. The landlords of thousands of acres of farmland on both sides of the river also jointly pleaded with the county government to quickly prevent the danger. On the 17th, the county government forwarded the request to the North China Water Conservancy Commission for attention. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 17th, the water level of the South Canal rose again. The first and second sections of the Chang River reported to the River Bureau on the 17th that the water level at Lianzhen reached 16.29 meters, and the current was rapid, already level with the banks. The River Bureau has purchased materials, but due to delays in water transport, they will be transported from the Jinpu Railway on the 18th. It also ordered the three counties of Nanpi, Anci, and Wuqing to mobilize civilians to ascend the dikes and defend together. Zhu Baoqi, the director of the Flood Control Engineering Office, and others immediately set out to inspect. According to the River Bureau's investigation, the water rose due to the outbreak of mountain floods in Shanxi and half a month of continuous rain. The upstream Zhanghe River water rose and flowed downstream. Currently, nearly 300 villages along the river are in danger. The Hebei Construction Department remitted 5,000 yuan for emergency flood prevention expenses on the 17th and will continue to allocate funds. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e35">Financial Report at the Second Plenary Session (Continued from Yesterday) <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding finance, Kong stated that in the past year, the economy was affected by the global recession and devastated by floods and bandits, reaching a low point. The industrial and commercial sectors were on the verge of total collapse. In the midst of extreme difficulties, the Ministry of Finance established the Industrial and Commercial Loan Committee and the Money Industry Supervision Committee, and allocated public bonds to provide relief to the market, thereby turning the tide. To stabilize finance and revive the economy, the legal tender policy was implemented in November of last year, with a reserve for the issuance of legal tender. Before the implementation of the legal tender policy, the total issuance by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications was more than 423 million yuan. By the beginning of July this year, it had increased to more than 861 million yuan, an increase of more than 440 million yuan in eight months. Part of this was to exchange for silver in the market, and part was to exchange for banknotes from banks other than the three banks. All issuance reserves are managed by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee and its local branches. Currently, the entire country, except for Guangdong and Guangxi, has uniformly complied with the policy and found it very convenient. Furthermore, due to the chaos of subsidiary currency, which harmed society, after the implementation of the legal tender policy, a subsidiary currency regulation was drafted and, after legislative procedures, promulgated by the National Government. The Central Mint was immediately ordered to cast new subsidiary currency in accordance with the regulation, uniformly in decimal units. Every time 100% of the new subsidiary currency is issued, one yuan of legal tender is reserved. By the end of June of this year, new subsidiary currency with a face value of approximately 8 million yuan in legal tender had been minted and circulated throughout the country. It is estimated that the number minted will reach 30 million yuan by the end of this year. Stabilizing exchange rates and consolidating legal tender are closely related. At the beginning of the legal tender policy, one yuan of legal tender had a fixed price with the currencies of various countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and Japan, which the three banks bought and sold according to. However, some who did not understand the truth said that we were linked to the British pound, while others said that we were linked to the US dollar. In fact, our currency system is autonomous and independent and is not linked to the currency system of any country. However, for the sake of facilitating international payments, there must be a certain exchange rate with the currencies of various countries to serve as a basis for calculation. Since the implementation of the legal tender policy, foreign exchange reserves have been extremely abundant, and the exchange rate has remained stable. We are currently in contact with the United States to purchase silver from us and provide us with the convenience of US currency at any time. With more abundant exchange reserves, the legal tender guarantee will be further strengthened, which is of great benefit to stabilizing finance, revitalizing the economy, and compensating for shortcomings. Furthermore, our country's banking system is not yet sound. In order to consolidate finance and promote legal tender, the government must adjust the banking system. For example, the percentage of commercial shares in the Central Bank has been increased from 40% to 60%. In the future, it is also planned to change it to a Central Reserve Bank so that it can be in a neutral position and become a purely financial center. As for other banks with special characteristics, such as the Bank of China, which develops international exchange, the Bank of Communications, which develops industry, and the Farmers Bank of China, which promotes agriculture, we are now urging these banks to develop separately in accordance with their responsibilities and are planning to establish a real estate mortgage bank to activate urban land finance. In addition, regulations such as the Banking Law and the Savings Bank Law are planned to be revised appropriately, and regulations such as the Land Bank, Provincial Bank, County Bank, and revised company regulations are drafted to establish a system and complete the banking system. Finally, Kong concluded that, in short, the financial foundation is built on the national economy. To ensure sound national finances, we must first seek the development of the social economy. Therefore, our efforts in the future should focus on production and construction and cultivating tax sources. Then, the social economy will develop day by day, and the foundation of finance will naturally be consolidated. Therefore, future financial policies should pay attention to five things: (1) save unnecessary expenditures and increase production and construction funds to enrich people's lives; (2) carefully select tax officials, strictly examine them, and eliminate accumulated malpractices to increase tax revenue; (3) rectify old taxes and promote new taxes to increase income and achieve a balance of revenue and expenditure; (4) improve the banking system and improve agricultural credit to facilitate the circulation of funds and promote industrial development; (5) unify the currency system and stabilize exchange rates to develop foreign trade and seek a balance of international payments. However, financial affairs are complex and multifaceted. It is hoped that all comrades in the party and compatriots throughout the country will work together to implement the financial reform program and achieve the goal of benefiting the country and the people. This is what we earnestly hope for. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e36">Domestic Goods: Measures for Transportation and Sales Licensing <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the "Provisional Regulations for Inspecting the Transportation and Sales of Imported Goods" and the types of goods subject to inspection, previously stipulated by the Ministry of Finance, a total of twenty-six kinds were listed, including rayon and alcohol. The Ministry stated that among these listed goods, some are manufactured domestically and are considered domestic goods. However, in reality, they are extremely difficult to distinguish from foreign goods. Therefore, these domestic goods are often detained when transported to various places, pending investigation into their origin. This situation is a significant impediment to legitimate trade and urgently needs to be remedied. The measures are now stipulated as follows: (1) When the domestic goods among the above-mentioned twenty-six kinds are transported through customs, the customs office shall issue a "Domestic Goods Transportation and Sales License." If the goods need to be transported to other locations for distribution after reaching their destination, the relevant trade association, chamber of commerce, or factory federation shall be notified to issue a "Domestic Goods Distribution License" based on the "Domestic Goods Transportation and Sales License" issued by the customs office. (2) If domestic goods are transported within the mainland without passing through customs, the relevant trade association, chamber of commerce, or factory federation shall be notified to issue a "Domestic Goods Certificate." On the 17th, the Ministry sent the above measures to all relevant agencies for compliance and implementation. (17th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reports, to avoid customs inspection of rayon imports, certain individuals are changing their methods, smuggling in large quantities of rayon components and blended rayon fabrics to evade customs interference.

<p>(Paris) The French government now agrees with the United Kingdom and Belgium to convene a meeting of the Locarno Pact nations in London. Belgium has also agreed to this. The meeting will open on the 23rd. Germany and Italy will not participate. (17th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The second Locarno meeting will be held in London on the 23rd of this month. The French government is no longer opposed to this, according to a confirmation by responsible officials. At that time, France will be represented by Prime Minister Léon Blum and Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos. (17th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Locarno meeting, some members of Parliament in the休憩室 (likely "restroom") recently stated that Britain now advocates that the UK, France, and Belgium hold a meeting in London, instead of in Brussels, and before the meeting, the three countries should issue a joint communiqué to explain that the goal of the meeting is to find ways to resolve various outstanding European issues. The text of this communiqué has already been drafted and is being sought after for French agreement. It is also heard that the government will send a cabinet member to Berlin to hold consultations with the German government in preparation for another meeting in the future, to which all relevant European countries will be invited. (16th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Locarno Pact conference was originally scheduled to convene in Brussels on July 22nd. However, since the British Cabinet did not make a decision on this matter yesterday morning, the date, agenda, and organization of the conference are still under discussion. The intention of people here is that, whenever the conference is held, its sole purpose should be to resolve European problems. This would be best achieved by a meeting of the five powers. If France believes that a three-power meeting should be held first to prepare for a larger meeting, then Britain should be persuaded. Britain is not prepared to participate in a three-power meeting that focuses on registering the failure of mediation efforts and does not have the goal of successfully resolving European problems. It is believed here that the formation of a Western bloc by Britain, France, and Belgium to confront the Central European bloc of Germany, Austria, and Italy is not conducive to peace. Yesterday, British Foreign Secretary Eden clarified this to the French and Belgian ambassadors. The Foreign Secretary stated in response to questions in the House of Commons yesterday that the suggestions drafted in London on March 19 by the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact, except for Germany, in preparation for the failure of mediation efforts, have not yet occurred. (17th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e46">Locarno Issue: Britain and France See Eye to Eye, Germany Will Issue Statement on British Questions <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>(London) It is generally believed that the Cabinet has not yet made a firm decision on whether to postpone the upcoming Locarno meeting. Political figures believe that the original agenda of the Locarno meeting was due to Germany's failure to reply to the British questions, and therefore the UK, France, and Belgium planned to take joint measures to respond. Now that the German-Austrian agreement has been concluded, Italy and Germany have become closer to each other. If the original agenda is maintained, Italy and Germany will cooperate more closely because of the close relationship between the UK, France, and Belgium. Therefore, if the Locarno meeting is held, its scope of discussion should be limited. In addition, the agreement concluded at the first Locarno meeting on March 19 stipulated that the general staffs of the relevant countries should discuss permanent measures to ensure the security of France and Belgium. Britain is afraid that if this is done, it will only further encourage Italy and Germany to become closer, so it does not intend to stipulate it. The Cabinet now instructs Foreign Secretary Eden to negotiate with France and Belgium based on the above views. The Foreign Secretary met with the ambassadors of those countries in the afternoon for discussions. (16th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the objectives of the Locarno meeting, responsible parties recently stated that the French government holds the same views as Britain. What are the objectives? Namely (1) to study the general situation in Europe with reference to the agreement concluded between Germany and Austria; (2) to prepare for another meeting to be attended by Italy and Germany. After the current Locarno meeting is convened, it is imperative to devise the most appropriate way to conduct talks with Germany so that the situation in Europe can be clarified. It was also said that the French government does not currently wish to request Britain to implement the guarantees that the British government previously submitted to France and Belgium on April 3, stating the various measures that Britain should take to ensure the security of the two countries. (16th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Since Britain presented a list of questions on April 7, the German government has not yet responded. Diplomatic sources recently announced on the evening of yesterday that the German government now plans to issue a statement to respond to the British government. At the same time, it will also recognize the Abyssinian Empire established by Italy. (17th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) After the agreement between Germany and Austria was concluded a few days ago, political figures were originally worried that the close relationship between Italy and Germany might lead to various dangers, and were therefore uneasy. Now, this concern has been somewhat reduced. According to these people, the policies pursued by Italy and Germany, especially in the Balkans, are fundamentally incompatible. Therefore, the closeness between the two countries is only superficial. In fact, they only want to use each other to achieve their own goals. According to news from Rome, when Italy was using troops in Abyssinia, it had no time to take care of the defenses of the Brenner Pass, and secretly tried its best to help Germany and Austria conduct negotiations. After the end of the Italian-Abyssinian war, Italy still strongly promoted the conclusion of the German-Austrian agreement. Its intention is nothing more than two points: first, to show Britain and France that the Austrian issue cannot be solved without the assistance of Italy; second, to avoid the imminent danger of the merger of Germany and Austria. That's all. It is heard that Italy recently made another guarantee to Britain, stating that the country has always maintained peaceful intentions in the Balkans, so that Britain can cancel its mutual assistance agreements with the countries along the Mediterranean coast. This is the biggest obstacle for Italy to participate in the Locarno meeting. (16th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin officially stated in the House of Commons today that Britain cannot agree to Germany's request to reclaim pre-war colonies. It is reported that General Pirow, Minister of Defense of the Union of South Africa, had declared to the press that Britain was prepared to consider Germany's request to reclaim colonies with a sympathetic attitude. Baldwin's statement today was made in response to this. (16th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) At the meeting of the House of Commons today, members questioned the remarks made by Mr. Pirow, Minister of Defense of the Union of South Africa, upon his return to South Africa from Britain regarding the colonial issue, and Prime Minister Baldwin answered them one by one. Members asked whether the government had formally discussed the issue of Germany's request to reclaim African colonies during its consultations with him during Pirow's visit to Britain, and whether it had made Pirow believe that if Germany made such a request in the future, the British government would treat it with sympathy. The Prime Minister replied that he believed that this questioning was based on misunderstanding. He heard that when Pirow returned to South Africa and met with reporters, he personally stated that the impression he (Pirow) expressed was the result of his private observations from conversations with individuals and groups, and not the result of special discussions with people in the British government. As far as the British government's attitude in its own country is concerned, he cannot add anything to what he said in the House of Commons on this issue before. Then Conservative MP Crowder and Churchill requested a clearer explanation. The Prime Minister replied that the government's answer could be said to be thorough and clear. As for the question of whether the government had made Pirow believe that if Germany made a request regarding colonies in the future, the British government would treat it with sympathy, he now answered no.

<p>Montreux. After the Montreux Conference passed the Soviet Russian amendment yesterday, the main points of contention were resolved. As for the critical issues, namely (1) the issue of the survival of the Straits Management Committee, and (2) the issue of aircraft of various countries crossing Turkish airspace, these two items were also successfully resolved after the General Assembly discussed them. The General Assembly, at Turkey's request, abolished the former, and for the latter, it decided that the places where aircraft of other countries are prohibited from flying are limited to the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits and the areas of the Sea of Marmara where fortifications are located. In addition, the General Assembly also decided that although Italy has not participated in the meeting, it can still sign and join it in the future. The General Assembly's discussion, which lasted until 10:00 PM tonight, has fully reached a compromise. The Drafting Committee is now putting the final touches on the draft of the new convention, which is expected to be completed tomorrow so that the General Assembly can be held at 3:00 PM on Saturday to pass the new convention. As for the signing period, it is scheduled for 3:00 PM on Monday. (16th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Prague, Czech Republic: After the German-Austrian agreement was concluded, Czechoslovakia's attitude, due to its geographical location, is most noteworthy. Foreign Minister Krofta gave a speech yesterday, first stating that "Czechoslovakia is willing to act in concert with its allies," and then saying that after the German-Austrian agreement was concluded, the issue of the restoration of the old Habsburg imperial family of Austria will not be realized. This is what the countries of Central Europe should welcome. Also, the opposition between Germany and Italy had previously hindered the Central European economic organization. Now that the German-Austrian agreement has been concluded, this economic organization will inevitably be easier to establish. (16th Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e50">Mussolini's Alarming Secret Plan: Five Measures to Transform the European Situation <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) After the German-Austrian agreement was concluded, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is said to be presenting an alarming plan to transform Europe when his vacation is over. Political figures recently put forward the following key points:</p>
<p>(1) Italian diplomacy is aimed at peace, and its purpose is to find a way out for the country's economy. There is no intention of expanding territory. As far as collective security mechanisms are concerned, Italy believes that their purpose is only to guarantee the security of France's borders, which is not comprehensive enough and cannot be approved by Italy.</p>
<p>(2) Italy is willing to cooperate with its friendly countries in Central Europe according to the original plan, but this plan is not to form a Central European group that is isolated from other countries in Europe. It will be different if other countries in Europe adopt a hostile attitude towards Italy. The various countries in Europe should also establish organizations around the Central European group.</p>
<p>(3) Italy still adheres to the principle that the countries of Europe should be divided into strong and weak, and is willing to cooperate with the strong countries. Regarding this point, it is generally believed that Italy has been in contact with Soviet Russia. Although Italy refuses to participate in the plan to encircle Germany, it also does not want to make friends with Germany alone. In addition, the second Locarno conference has been decided to be held first by the UK, France, and Belgium, and a five-nation conference will not be convened. Although Italian public opinion has expressed dissatisfaction with this, it believes that cooperation with France is still necessary. Regarding this point, Italy has issued a statement that it must wait for the mutual assistance measures established by the countries along the Mediterranean coast last autumn to be cancelled before it can participate. Since these mutual assistance measures have not been declared cancelled, Italy has reason to refuse to participate and should be glad. Prime Minister Mussolini believes that if Italy does not participate in this conference, it will be difficult to find a solution, and it would be better to postpone the date.</p>
<p>(4) The method of transforming Europe must be practical. In other words, compromise solutions must be established for all major issues. This can be seen from the agreement recently concluded between Germany and Austria. As for the reduction of armaments, it is actually impossible, so the countries concerned must limit armaments. The sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant should also be revised so that Italy can participate in the activities of the League of Nations again.</p>
<p>(5) Italy's plan originally intended to revise the treaties of peace of the European War, but political figures do not think so. They said that since Italy and Yugoslavia are in harmony, even though Turkey and Greece have both participated in the Mediterranean mutual assistance measures, Italy's current agreements with these countries are still valid. At the same time, Italy is also closely watching the development of Romania's current policies. As for Czechoslovakia, political figures did not mention a word about it. It is not yet known whether its policy is the same as Germany's policy towards Czechoslovakia. (17th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e51">Fascist Faction in Romania Massacres Former Leader Shot to Death in Hospital by Subordinates <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Bucharest, Romania: The former leader of the fascist Iron Guard, Stere, had an operation in the hospital for appendicitis. Today, eight members of the Iron Guard stormtroopers broke into the door and shouted, "Traitor, you can die now!" Then they shot wildly with their pistols, causing him to be riddled with bullet holes and die. After the murderers achieved their goal, they went to the police station to turn themselves in. It is reported that Mr. Stere broke away from the Iron Guard after the assassination of Prime Minister Duca in 1933, and formed his own fascist group called the Crusaders. (16th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania: Former Member of Parliament Sterescu was an important member of the Iron Guard, but he later separated from it and formed another fascist group. He spared no effort in attacking Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the leader of the Iron Guard, saying that he was of foreign origin, so they were at odds with each other. Mr. Sterescu was recently ill and was recuperating in the hospital. Today, eight youths suddenly broke into the ward and shot him with their pistols. Mr. Sterescu died on the spot. The murderers also turned themselves in and confessed to the authorities that Mr. Sterescu had betrayed the group and had been sentenced to death by the group. What they did was "execution" according to orders. It is investigated that the students in the capital have formed a group called "Knowing Only the Motherland" and have a blacklist, and those listed on it will be killed without mercy. It is heard that Mr. Sterescu is on the list. In addition, several important figures, especially some leaders of the National Peasants' Party, are also said to be on the list.

<p>Cairo: The arrival here today of the 11th Hussars and a unit of special forces from Egypt is a sign that the situation in Palestine is becoming increasingly serious. Since the outbreak of riots in Palestine, eight British battalions have been dispatched to the area. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: The British authorities previously ordered the town of Gaza to pay a fine of 1,000 pounds for attacking British soldiers and disrupting railways. Today, ten representatives of the Muslim community in the town appealed to the Palestinian High Court against this measure. The court has agreed to halt the collection of the fine. Meanwhile, bombings and riots continue to occur throughout the region. Last night, a patrol near Nazareth was attacked by Arab rioters, and one British soldier sustained minor injuries. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: The Arab strike and boycott, which began in mid-April of this year, has now lasted three months. Although the general public is feeling weary, the strike and boycott are continuing. Arab leaders remain steadfast, hoping that the government will prevent or restrict Jewish immigration to Palestine. However, in reality, Jewish immigration continues. The government has recently issued permits for the number of immigrants that can be admitted in the six-month period from April to September of this year. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e53">The French Chamber of Deputies Passed Two Important Bills Yesterday: Reorganization of the Bank of France and Nationalization of the Arms Industry <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies today passed the Nationalization of the Arms Industry bill with 448 votes in favor and 85 against. The bill stipulates that the transfer of property of various arms factories can be carried out by the government purchasing shares at an average market price over the past seven years. The payment method will be through the issuance of public bonds. The Chamber of Deputies will also appoint an arbitration committee to resolve disputes arising from the transfer of property. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) This morning, the Chamber of Deputies continued to discuss the bill to nationalize the military industry. Right-wing Deputy Valentin proposed an amendment advocating that the government establish a permanent monitoring system instead of nationalization. The Chamber of Deputies ultimately rejected this amendment with 393 votes against and 164 in favor. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The bill to reorganize the Bank of France, proposed by Finance Minister Olivol, was recently passed by the Chamber of Deputies with a large majority of 430 votes in favor and 111 against. During the discussion, deputies from opposition parties expressed their opinions on various details of the reorganization bill. Subsequently, the rapporteur of the Finance Committee, Mr. Bruna, explained that the purpose of the reorganization was to change the administrative organization of the Bank of France to prevent it from being manipulated by a small number of large shareholders and to eliminate the preferential status enjoyed by those shareholders. However, the basic rules of the bank's operations and its powers regarding currency issuance, discounting, and lending will not be changed. The current reorganization bill is sufficient to achieve the above-mentioned objectives. Economically speaking, after the implementation of the reorganization plan, it is expected that the national credit system and the entire economic structure can be organized. Finance Minister Olivol then spoke, explaining the key points of the reorganization bill, stating that from now on, all shareholders of the Bank of France, regardless of the size of their shareholding, will enjoy the same rights and can participate in the election of directors (this right was previously limited to the 200 largest shareholders). After the reorganization, representatives from agriculture, industry, commerce, and labor will be able to join the administrative part of the Bank of France, and the position of governor will not necessarily be filled by a shareholder. Finally, Olivol asked the Chamber of Deputies to quickly pass the reorganization bill so that those who work for the welfare of the country can have their strength doubled to achieve success. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Finance Minister Olivol previously submitted a bill to the National Assembly, advocating that all funds owned by the French people and deposited abroad should be reported to the government with accurate figures before July 15th. Those who fail to report within the deadline will be severely punished. The Chamber of Deputies passed this bill on the 26th of last month, and the Senate also passed it yesterday. (Havas, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e55">Details of the King of England's Escape: Thanks to an American Woman and a Policeman; Congratulatory Letters and Telegrams Pour in from All Countries; The King is Calm, the Assailant is Mentally Ill <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>(London) This morning, the King of England spent his usual life at York Palace. Before starting his routine work, he read hundreds of congratulatory letters and telegrams from all over the world. The policeman who knocked down the assassin's pistol, named Dick, also received many congratulatory telegrams. Dick served in the Navy and participated in the European War for four years. The name of the woman who discovered the assassin is still kept secret by the police. It is said that the woman is about middle-aged, and it is widely believed that she must be American. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the assassination of the King, the first person to discover the rioter was a middle-aged woman in a gray coat. Although her actions are difficult to confirm, there is no doubt that she did something. After the incident, the situation was extremely chaotic. Some said that the woman was arrested at the same time as the rioter, but in fact, she was "escorted" to the police station by the police, and the chief of the station inquired about the details. Afterwards, the woman and a blonde girl left together, escorted back to their residence by police officers. The crowd cheered at them all the way, but the police station had made meticulous arrangements in advance to avoid passers-by asking questions. As for the woman's name, the police station did not announce it, fearing that after the disclosure, many people would come to express their admiration, which would make the woman feel uncomfortable. This woman in gray has thus become a mysterious and unpredictable heroine. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) After the news of the King of England's escape from assassination spread, there were very significant expressions of loyalty throughout England. When crowded crowds gathered outside the palace, sincerely expressing their loyalty, the House of Lords also changed its traditional solemn atmosphere. After Privy Counselor Halifax announced the situation of the King's assassination, all the members cheered loudly and thanked God for the King's escape. In the evening, the audience and theater troupes in many theaters in London sang the national anthem "God Save the King". The only calm and composed person in the midst of the national surprise yesterday afternoon was the King himself. After the assassin was arrested, the King continued to ride forward as if nothing had happened. After the meal, he took a car from New York Palace to the Com Hill Golf Club to play golf as usual. When he returned to London in the evening, he went to St. James's Palace to handle government affairs. The first person to congratulate the King on his safe return to London was his mother, Queen Mary. This unexpected incident shocked the country. The British people initially expressed surprise rather than anger, because although the King had only been in power for a short time, he had already won the love of the people. At the same time, the King was already loved by the whole country when he was the Prince. Now, someone has assassinated him, so everyone is surprised. Then, they were relieved because the King was unharmed. It is said that the King's great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, also escaped assassination in 1862. There is also a very coincidental event, that is, Queen Victoria was assassinated five times in her life, one of which was only a short distance from the place where the incident occurred this time. The assassin is said to be a journalist. In the afternoon, the Campbell Police Court in Poole Street was presided over by Sir Campbell. The charges were illegal possession of weapons and intent to endanger life. The assassin was wearing brown clothes, without a tie, and was trembling violently. Because he was disabled, he had a slight limp and wore specially made leather boots. Detectives told the court that when the assassin was taken to the police station, he said, "This is the fault of Sir Simon (Home Secretary). I sent him a letter last night and called him again this morning. The King was not injured at all. I really didn't want to hurt him. I just wanted to express my protest." Before the trial began, a burly figure in a flannel shirt and carrying an umbrella entered the court and was led to the lawyer's seat. When asked for his name, he replied, "I am here to observe the trial in a private capacity." The presiding officer asked the defendant a few words and then ordered him to be detained for eight days pending further trial. The defendant had a lawyer to defend him. The detective presented the defendant's weapon as evidence, of which five chambers were loaded with four bullets, and only the highest chamber was empty. The defendant had a postcard of the British King's portrait, a newspaper, and two bullets in his pocket. After the presiding officer ordered the defendant to be detained, his lawyer stated that the defendant, in view of the news in the evening papers, wished to declare that he had no intention or will to assassinate. When the trial was in progress, a large number of people gathered outside the court, and the police station sent a large number of police officers to maintain order. The defendant was then sent to Brixton Prison by car. When he left the court, the crowd pointed and scolded him. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) After the arrest of Mahon, the assassin of King Edward VIII of England, his defense lawyer Coston requested the court today to investigate whether the suspect had a mental illness. Officials indicated that they could approve his request. According to reports, after the suspect was arrested, he spoke incoherently and denied that he intended to harm the King, saying that he only wanted to express a "protest", but he could not explain what he was protesting. It is reported that in mid-April of this year, the suspect used the name McMahon to sue Mrs. Erlsder, a famous opponent of the death penalty, demanding compensation for car rental fees of 67 pounds and 6 shillings. The case was subsequently dismissed, and the appeal was not allowed. At that time, Mahon shouted "injustice" until the court ordered him to apologize. At the same time, it is reported that the police station had already anticipated that an unfortunate incident would occur yesterday, so two detectives were watching at the place where Mahon lived. Sergeant Sanzi said that Mahon had a picture of the British King and a copy of the Daily Telegraph newspaper, with the words "Do I love you?" written on the newspaper. He looked very panicked. It is also known that he recently edited a "Humanitarian Magazine." The King of England did not care about this scare yesterday. Today, he still took a car to Com Hill to play golf. He only called Mahon "a fool". Everyone believes that after this incident, the police station will pay more attention to protecting the King's safety. However, when the King was not yet in power, he did not like plainclothes detectives following him, and he often deliberately avoided them. According to the Daily Express, the suspect's real name is Pennygan, 34 years old, Irish, living in Glasgow, and has a brother in Dublin who is a priest. (National Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Mahon, the assassin of King Edward of England, must have lost his mind due to a kind of anxiety. His statement in court that he had sent a letter and made a phone call to Home Secretary Simon proves that he was opposed to the Home Secretary. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<p>(Washington) U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines McNutt stated today that the State Department will soon announce matters concerning the preparatory talks for the U.S.-Philippines economic conference and Japanese textile products imported into the Philippines. McNutt conferred with Undersecretary of State Sayre and Far East Division Director Hornbeck all day today to discuss these issues, and also discussed confidential matters with Assistant Chief of Staff of the Army Major General Emmick. McNutt then stated, "We are drafting an agreement that can not only help the U.S. textile industry, but also be accepted by Japan and the Philippine autonomous government." As for the existing "gentleman's agreement" between the U.S. and Japan to divide the textile market in the Philippines, McNutt believes that although the result is not as satisfactory as initially expected, both sides have been able to comply. Unfortunately, Japan's transshipment of textiles to the Philippines from Hong Kong and other Chinese ports has greatly affected the plan. (National Telegraph, 16th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of the Interior approved a letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based on a request from the International Representation Office, to avoid using the word "slave" in official documents and laws. This is because the Chinese characters for "slave" and "maid" are often used together in Chinese writing habits. In fact, the word "slave" refers to a servant, which is different from the foreign concept of "slave" (Slave) who is bought and sold and treated as property for life without freedom. In order to avoid misunderstandings in the international community, in the future, government agencies should not use the word "slave" in laws and official documents unless they are actually referring to slaves who are bought and sold, so as to correct international perceptions. The Ministry of the Interior has informed the governments of all provinces and cities accordingly. (Central News Agency, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e81">Where is Hirota's Cabinet Going? (2) <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Jia He</p>
<p>Hirota, once he stepped from Kasumigaseki (location of the Foreign Ministry) into the Prime Minister's official residence in Nagatacho, changed his demeanor. He was no longer a docile lamb, obedient to the military in everything; instead, he acted contrary to the military and bickered with them. This was because the major issue of disciplining the military weighed heavily on the military's mind; because General Terauchi opposed the behavior of the young officers that could disrupt military discipline; and because Admiral Nagano rigorously enforced the navy's complete discipline. Therefore, after the cabinet was formed, it was not Hirota who was busy fulfilling his pre-cabinet promises, but rather the military who were busy with their own "internal stability work." In the army, figures responsible for the "February 26th Incident" were successively removed from their positions. Even General Honjo Shigeru, who had achieved great merit and was elevated to the rank of baron from a commoner background for his contributions in seizing Manchuria, had to retire from the Imperial Palace (resign from his post as aide-de-camp to the Emperor). In the navy, figures like Masaki Jinzaburo, who had echoed the radical fascists with the "national essence clarification issue," were removed from the navy by Navy Minister Nagano. At this juncture, Prime Minister Hirota, breaking with established precedent, ordered that the three chief officials—the chief secretary, the director of the investigation bureau, and the director of the legislative bureau—not be allowed to attend cabinet meetings. In this way, not only did he fail to fulfill the promises he made before forming the cabinet, but he also turned Yoshida Shigeru, the military's trustee, into his own subordinate.</p>
<p>As a result, a chaotic battle unfolded on the Japanese political stage between the bureaucracy, the political parties, and the military. Regarding the bureaucracy's attacks on the Hirota cabinet and Hirota's counterattacks, and the political parties' internal struggles against the bureaucracy and their open disputes with Hirota, I have already provided a general overview in the 25th issue of the Central News Weekly, and to avoid repetition, I will refrain from elaborating further in this article.</p>
<p>Hirota not only weakened the authority of the Cabinet Investigation Bureau but also severed the connections between the young bureaucrats in various ministries and the military. Interior Minister Toshi Oiso wielded a broadsword, eliminating those who had long been sympathetic to the military; using the pretext of "election violations," he arrested numerous assemblymen, causing those associated with fascism to tremble with fear. Even the renowned Kuhara Fusanosuke "went missing" because of this. In addition, he mobilized the national police to arrest right-wing activists. As a result, the military's external support was eliminated, and its influence inevitably diminished. These tasks were nearing completion when the special session of the Diet opened. The army also knew that the Diet was the organ that would judge them, and they had to grasp onto a weapon that could make the Diet members yield; that weapon was the "martial law decree." Thus, breaking the record of Japanese parliamentary history, the sacred Diet opened under the encirclement of guns and swords.</p>
<p>On the opening day of the Diet, a "reply to the Imperial Rescript" movement swept through the bourgeois camp, because, breaking with established precedent, the Emperor specifically mentioned the "February 26th Incident" in the rescript. The incident was a past fact, and it was recorded in the rescript, which was not surprising. The reason for the panic among Japanese property owners was to investigate the responsibility for the incident. The more earnestly this was pursued, the more inevitable pressure was placed on the military.</p>
<p>In his "policy speech," Prime Minister Hirota also pointed out that "this unprecedented and unfortunate event... its cause lies in the instigation of unstable elements both inside and outside the military." The only way to extinguish it was to "promote constitutionalism." The more constitutionalism was promoted, the more the military would be brought to submission. This was the goal of the propertied politicians, but whether it could be achieved was another matter. As a result, our Prime Minister Hirota earned the praise of the propertied Diet members. He not only boldly defended constitutionalism but also openly replied to Aso Hisashi of the Social Masses Party's question about "the correctness or incorrectness of the capitalist system" by saying, "I do not know its essence." Although Kazami Akira ridiculed this as "a response below the level of a middle school student," Hirota frankly told Hamada Kunimatsu: "Regarding the question of the correctness or incorrectness of capitalism, such as industrial control and liberalism... because I am not an expert, I lack such knowledge and have not done sufficient research." Before forming the cabinet, didn't he deny liberalism and advocate "a fresh start for all government affairs," wanting to reform the irrational parts of capitalism? Didn't he propose controlling the zaibatsu and thus earn the honorable title of "Control Cabinet"? Now, he has denied it all at once, no wonder the Asahi Shimbun said: "This can be seen as a bold response of self-negation."</p>

<p>Youtou Correspondence: Since Yu Hanmou was ordered to lead troops back to Guangdong, the situation in the upper reaches of the Eastern Han River has begun to unfold. Yu's 123rd Division line extends from Nanxiong, Xinfeng, Qiannan, Dingnan, Anyuan to Longchuan, Xingning, Wuhua, connecting with Deng Longguang's division. These four divisions are the elite of the Guangdong army, so Yu's military power has increased. Chen Jitang then ordered the Northeast Han River army to shorten its defense line. Huang Renhuan's Fourth Army retreated to the corner of Meixian, Jiaoling, and Dapu. Chen Hanguang's brigade guarded Chao'an and Fengshun. The families of officers in each army believe that war in the upper reaches of the Eastern Han River is unavoidable. Last week, they successively moved to Hong Kong. Each time a Hong Kong ship sailed, the cabins were bought up by officers' wives. Everyone scrambled to buy Hong Kong currency, causing the value of the legal tender to plummet. People's hearts are extremely shaken. Currently, there are no formal troops stationed in the coastal counties of Chaozhou and Shantou, and national defense is empty. The Salt Police Regiment, which was transferred to Shantou last month, was reorganized into a Garrison Army, following the Ninth Division to Wuhua and Zijin, currently stationed at Qinv Lake, Laolong, and Heyuan, defending the upper reaches of the Dong River, cooperating with the Huizhou Third Army to prevent Yu's troops from advancing. The counties, districts, and townships in the heart of Chaozhou and Shantou rely only on guards and militia to maintain rear security. Remnants of bandits from the Min border in Zhao'an harass the territory of Rao and Pu. Shops in Huanggang, Fushan, and Qian Dong are closed. Cars on the Huangzhao Highway dare not travel. Remnants of bandits run rampant during the day, taking advantage of the situation to invade the territory of Chenghai. For the past ten days, wealthy families in Yanzao, Jingzhou, and Donglong have mostly moved to Shantou to avoid the bandits. Chaos and anxiety are now engulfing the lakes and mountains.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Si Lie Discusses: Central Government's Financial Relief for Fujian Province, Foreign Debt Cleared by Central Government, Domestic Debt Repaid by Fujian Province <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Si Lie, the new Director of the Finance Department of Fujian Province, is scheduled to take office on the 16th of this month. According to Mr. Si, the crux of the financial difficulties in this province lies in the failure to balance income and expenditure, with a monthly deficit of 200,000 yuan. Furthermore, the heavy burden of historical debt has led to robbing Peter to pay Paul and a hand-to-mouth existence. The failure to effectively reorganize various taxes is also an important reason. He is determined to thoroughly reorganize after taking office, strictly defining the reward and punishment measures for each tax bureau, and eliminating embezzlement and corruption. On the one hand, he will request the Central Government to assist in clearing debts and strengthening the financial foundation. It is reported that the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, after the Provincial Government Chairman Chen Yi's report to the capital, have clearly understood the financial difficulties of Fujian Province. They have already agreed that all foreign debts will be assigned to the Central Government for clearing, while domestic debts will be repaid by the province. They also agreed to issue short-term treasury bonds of 900,000 yuan for thirty-five years to supplement the budget deficit and to increase monthly subsidies from 300,000 yuan to 400,000 yuan. This new increase of 100,000 yuan will be used by the provincial government to bear the expenses of the 52nd and 56th Divisions stationed in Fujian. As for provincial taxes, in addition to salt tax, customs duties, stamp tax, and tobacco and alcohol tax, which are national taxes and directly collected by agencies established by the central government, the remaining local taxes are collected by the tax bureau. However, due to the incomplete organization and excessive redundant agencies, a great deal of public funds are wasted. Now, the Finance Department believes that tax affairs should be unified, and a special business tax reorganization office has been established. A special order has been issued that from this month, all types of special business tax bureaus will be abolished and merged into the special business tax reorganization office for unified collection. The ten types of taxes, such as pawn tax, furnace tax, and house and shop land tax, will be handled by the county collection office to save provincial expenses and unify power. The county economic and collection offices and treasuries were established on July 1. All local taxes are collected by the economic and collection offices and deposited in the treasury every day. Then, the treasury will divide the funds daily according to the proportion of various expenditures for political, educational, and construction purposes, accumulating deposits in the treasury to avoid the evils of misappropriation and confusion. If the county government has temporary expenses, it can borrow a fixed amount of activity funds from the local branch treasury for application, calculated at 1,800 yuan per month for first-class counties, 1,200 yuan for second-class A counties, 1,000 yuan for second-class B counties, and 800 yuan for third-class counties. Borrowing can only continue after monthly settlements and clearing. When there is a shortage of grain, the county magistrate and the local finance committee can issue notes to borrow from the branch treasury for assistance. (July 15)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Daishan Fishermen and Salt Workers Riot: Thousands of Rioting Fishermen, Several People Including the Salt Yard Chief are Killed, Riot is Suppressed After the Rioters Leave <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Daishan Town in Dinghai County, isolated in the sea, is a fishing and salt production area in Ningbo, with a total of 20,000 households and a population of approximately 70,000. There are more than 200,000 coastal salt flats and more than 10,000 salt workers. Recently, the salt affairs authorities have actively reorganized salt tax revenue and prevented smuggling, reorganizing salt yards in various districts in eastern and western Zhejiang in stages. The first step is to implement the "fish and salt color change" to prevent fishermen from smuggling. The second step is to conduct "Shoujian Gong," requiring all salt production to be returned to the pile. The Daishan district has dispatched engineers several times to investigate and select sites to build public factories, and is discussing with the salt workers separately. However, due to the implementation of the "fish and salt color change" this year, the coastal fishermen in the area have repeatedly had disputes with the tax police due to minor reasons. In addition, this summer, there has been excessive rainfall, reducing salt production and soaring prices, with the selling price per dan rising from one yuan to between three and four yuan. The economic impact on fishermen has been significant. The general fishermen mistakenly believe that the salt affairs agencies are deliberately making things difficult, so they harbor deep resentment. On the 8th of this month, more than 1,000 salt workers from Daishan and local fishermen from Nanfeng Mountain gathered at Zifusi Temple for a meeting. Representatives from salt yards and cooperatives also participated. As a result, there was no excessive behavior. However, on the 9th, at a continued meeting, there was a resolution to seal the boards and stop sunning the salt to express opposition to the return to the pile. Some salt workers who did not agree had more than 100 salt flats smashed and houses burned. Subsequently, the Daishan Salt Yard Chief and Weighing and Distribution Bureau Chief Miao reported that more than 100 fishing boats from Fenghua and Taizhou fishing gangs (commonly known as the Red and Blue Flag gangs, famous for being fierce fishermen who killed the anti-smuggling battalion commander in the eighth year of the Republic of China), with approximately 1,000 fishermen, had joined in, carrying firearms and led by several leaders, plotting mischief. At 9 a.m. on the 13th, more than 2,000 people gathered again and convened a general meeting at Donghua Palace, resolving to use force to resist the return to the pile and preparing to riot and burn down the salt yards. Salt Yard Chief Miao immediately dispatched a tax police squad, led by squad leader Hu Bugui, to suppress them. A conflict broke out between the two sides, with gunfire and mutual attacks, resulting in deaths and injuries on both sides. Squad Leader Hu was killed on the spot. At around 3 p.m., the rioting crowd turned to the salt yards and surrounded them. The fishermen with guns were in front, and the salt workers were in the back. The tax police at the salt yard defended with live ammunition. Bullets and stones flew back and forth, lasting for about four hours. It is estimated that four fishermen were killed and the tax police suffered minor casualties. As a result, the tax police were outnumbered. At around 7 p.m., the rioting crowd broke through the back of the Weighing and Distribution Bureau, and Feng, a tax police officer, protected the salt yard staff and broke through the encirclement. The rioting crowd, in addition to smashing all items, set fire to all the salt yard houses. A small squad of tax police stationed at nearby Dongshazui was also surrounded and disarmed by the rioters. Salt Yard Chief Miao and Clerk Qian Qirong escaped to the home of a gentry named Tang. They were discovered by the rioters, who forced them to hand them over, otherwise they would burn down the house. As a result, Miao, Qian, and others were killed with stones and their stomachs filled with stones and sunk into the sea. More than ten staff members were killed at the same time, and more than ten were missing. The salt yard chief and each staff member's private residences were all looted. By the morning of the 14th, the burning and looting were completed. The rioters were still guarding the main roads, cutting off traffic. Therefore, no news could leak out. It was not until the fishermen boarded ships and left in the afternoon that martial law was lifted. Bei Shouwen, an engineer who was reorganizing the salt yards, escaped to Hangzhou on the 15th and reported everything to the Liangzhe Transportation Office. He said that this joint riot of fishermen had created an unprecedented tragedy. The Daishan Salt Yard's goods were also looted, with a total loss of more than 100,000 yuan. It is reported that the Transportation Office has separately telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Zhejiang Transportation Headquarters to dispatch teams to suppress the riot. It is said that the Provincial Government has sent security teams and the Second Squadron of the Water Police, and dispatched troops to cooperate with the Dinghai County Government to send personnel to investigate the riot.</p>

<p>The Wu County Business Tax Bureau previously sent a large number of staff to various shops to investigate the amount of business tax. However, because the filled-in estimated statements did not take into account the actual situation and were filled in arbitrarily, even differing by more than ten times, all industries opposed them and denied the estimated statements. They submitted the estimated statements to the County Chamber of Commerce and the County Chamber of Commerce convened representatives of various industries to hold a meeting, deciding: 1. Deny the estimate. Regarding the issue of checking accounts, if necessary, the respective industry guilds may send personnel to participate in the handling. Subsequently, after several contacts between Cheng Ganqing, Chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, and Feng, Director of the Tax Bureau, a solution was agreed upon. The Tax Bureau will send personnel to jointly check the account books of the shops in various industries in the Chamber of Commerce with members of the Chamber of Commerce.

<h3 id="e91">Wuxi: Silk Factories Scheduled to Resume Work This Morning <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The problem of the Wuxi silk factory workers going on strike has eased slightly in the past few days. The county government originally limited the factories to resume work on the 17th, but the factories requested the county magistrate to postpone it by one day to resume operations on the 18th because the procedures were not completed and the internal affairs needed to be rectified. County Magistrate Long approved it. Regarding the provincial party headquarters, after reporting to the county party headquarters, a member, Zhang Gongren, was specially sent to Wuxi to mediate. After arriving in Wuxi, Zhang went directly to the county government to meet with County Magistrate Long to discuss solutions and instructed the committee members of the county party headquarters and the preparatory members of the General Labor Union on how to handle the situation. At 4 p.m. yesterday (the 17th), County Magistrate Long specially summoned representatives from each factory, four from each factory (two people in charge of the machines, two people at the head of the machines), to the county for a speech. More than one hundred representatives from 28 factories, including Ruichang and Yong, attended. County Magistrate Long gave an earnest speech: (1) All workers should resume work uniformly on the 18th. (2) The government will absolutely punish the rioters severely. (3) All workers should strictly observe local order and maintain social peace. Then, member Zhang gave a speech: (1) Labor and capital must work together to revitalize industry. (2) The Party and the government should help workers, gather opinions, and relieve workers' suffering. Finally, Sun Xiangfeng of the County Party Committee gave a speech, urging the workers to resume work, and put forward two suggestions: (1) To improve the treatment of workers, a trade union must be established to gather workers' opinions. (2) All workers should do their best to persuade the other workers to go to work and work with peace of mind on the County Magistrate's speech. All treatment and wage issues will be discussed and resolved after the Party and government agencies summon labor and capital representatives. At this point, the representatives dispersed. The county government has decided to mobilize fully at 3 a.m. this morning (the 18th) to persuade the workers. At present, the workers have agreed to resume work this morning.</p>

<p>Taihu Lake in this county is located between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The lake surface is vast, and management is very difficult. Therefore, thieves hide in the lake and plunder everywhere. Residents along the lake cannot live and work in peace. In the past two months, the farming season has arrived, and local defenses are inevitably lax. Lake bandits have taken this opportunity to become active again. According to secret reports recently received by the Second District Commissioner's Office and the District Security Headquarters, a large number of lake bandits have been discovered in Taihu Lake, which are extremely rampant and acting at the right time. Commissioner Cang issued an order to the Muyi County Government yesterday, ordering them to immediately cooperate with the counties along the lake, send teams to suppress and thoroughly eliminate the bandits to maintain security.</p>

In addition, Wuyi Buddhist Branch received a telegram from the General Directorate of Food, stating that in various places, there are often traitors disguised as monks, attempting to evade attention and plot wrongdoing. Not only is this related to the future of the monks, but it also has a great impact on national defense. Each temple should inquire about transient monks at any time, strictly investigate, and report any suspicious behavior to the local police office. The official office has ordered all temples to pay special attention.</p>

<p>Our county has grain fields amounting to, allegedly, 1.6 million mu. The Department of Finance also levies taxes based on this number.

If the minimum tax per mu is five jiao, then the annual revenue from this county alone would increase by more than 200,000 yuan. Simultaneously, the total land area of this county is now known to be over 2.3 million mu, which is over 600,000 mu more than before the land measurement.</p>

<h3 id="e103">This Week <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Beiping</p>
<p>Evolving Situation</p>
<p>In the past week, the situation in North China has shown significant changes. Because the Japanese side is completely ready on all points of personnel, policy, military, and economy, it has to require a clear solution in the near future. The consul general meeting in Shanghai and the three consecutive military attache meetings in Tianjin are a sign of this preparation. Therefore, Matsumoto Takayoshi, the deputy head of the Japanese garrison in Beiping, made a statement on the 10th, "Economic development in North China is beneficial to both China and Japan. According to the current situation, it is really necessary." He also said, "The politics of North China needs to be improved quite a bit. If the authorities are willing to work hard on their own, the Japanese side will definitely assist them." The so-called development is probably to be carried out by the Japanese side, and the so-called improvement is probably just to clarify the Hebei-Chahar political power and merge the Hebei-Shandong organization with the Hebei-Chahar political power.</p>
<p>However, at present, the Japanese side does not intend to take any steps militarily or politically. Its first step is still economic development. Under this goal, it exerts various pressures on the North China authorities. Of course, appropriate personnel are needed to cope with this very active pressure. Therefore, under the urging of both the Central Government and Song Zheyuan, Wang Kemin, who is familiar with the economic situation in North China, arrived in Beiping at 11:38 AM on the 9th. The Japanese side attaches great importance to Wang's arrival in the north and hopes to unfold the situation in North China from now on. Therefore, on the one hand, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita immediately sent an telegram to the Japanese officials here, "Absolutely assist," and on the other hand, Japanese tanks have been demonstrating between Tianjin, Fengtai, Beiping, and Tongxian for two consecutive days, as a means of both benevolence and coercion.</p>
<p>When Wang Kemin arrived in Beijing from Shanghai, it was rumored here that he would take over as the chairman of the Economic Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission. When he arrived in Tianjin, it was rumored here that he carried an "economic cooperation plan" in his luggage. However, after he met with the Japanese garrison commander in Tianjin, Tadashi, and with Song Zheyuan, Shimizu, Hanawa, and other Chinese and Japanese authorities in Peiping, his attitude here clearly showed that he was hungry. (1) The Chinese side is prepared to start economic cooperation with the Japanese side, but it must be beneficial to both countries. (2) The so-called economic cooperation plan is being discussed by the Chinese side, but there is no agreement at present. His visit here is just to inquire about the opinions of the Chinese and Japanese authorities here. Therefore, he will return to Beijing recently, and if necessary, he will travel between Nanjing and Beiping from time to time. According to statistics, Wang has stayed in Tianjin and Peiping for a week since arriving in Tianjin on the 7th. During this period, he had several banquets and talks with the Chinese and Japanese authorities, and the results were quite satisfactory. When he left Peiping on the 12th, he also made a very positive statement, saying that he would return to the north before the end of the month, and he would also consider the matter of the chairmanship of the Economic Committee at that time. Wang's trip probably made the attitudes of the Chinese and Japanese authorities here clear, and he will definitely report to the government authorities after returning to the south.</p>
<p>The Authorities' Support</p>
<p>External pressure is already enough to bear, and internal pressure is added with various declines and disturbances. For example, there are more than 380 stores in Tianjin that have closed down recently, and the general economic depression can be imagined. Therefore, the current expenses of the Hebei, Chahar, Peiping, and Tianjin local governments for the 20th year have to be reduced. Also, for example, Shi Yousan's wanted order has been explicitly revoked, and there are words such as meritorious service to the country in the explicit order, and recently, he will be appointed as a member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission. The difficult situation of the authorities and the painstaking effort to seek perfection can be seen.</p>
<p>After Chen Zhongfu arrived in Peiping from Guangdong via Japan, he immediately canceled his leave and resumed his position as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Zhang Zizhong, the mayor of Tianjin, had previously spread rumors of negativity due to the difficult situation, but after he came to Peiping for two days to report to Song and negotiate everything, he returned to Tianjin on the afternoon of the 8th to sit in town. All of this shows that the authorities in North China have reconciled much more in terms of personnel, and their steps seem to be very consistent. In particular, the resolution of the Fengtai and Tanggu incidents, from Song Zheyuan to all cadres and soldiers, can bear the burden of humiliation and respond calmly, and their intentions are also very admirable.</p>
<p>Regarding local security, around 1:00 PM on the 13th, the Public Security Bureau, together with the Japanese Police, went to No. 25 Zhengyang Street, Yantai, and No. 7 and 13 Liujia Hutong on the street to search and seize drug dens. They seized a total of 170 kilograms of opium and arrested seven principal criminals, including Korean nationals Zhao, Li, and Jin. For example, the capture of the giant bandit Liu Xiaohou, the imposition of the death penalty on repeat opium addicts, and the criminals who colluded with a certain country to forcibly occupy houses of the people are all manifestations of the authorities' determination to maintain social stability. Recently, Wu Enfu, the police chief of the western suburbs, was shot and killed while arresting bandits. When all walks of life initiated a donation to comfort him, Kurogen, the president of the Japanese New China News Agency, also donated ten yuan, which shows that even foreigners with vision agree with the authorities' determination to maintain law and order.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been various rumors about finance in North China. In Tianjin, the sudden circulation of 30,000 to 40,000 yuan of subsidiary coins in the market caused various anxieties. In Peiping, the discovery of a large number of counterfeit Chinese, Jiaotong, Hebei, and other bank notes greatly hit the credibility of legal currency circulation. In this situation of financial unrest, the authorities sent personnel to re-inspect and seal the silver deposits in Peiping and Tianjin to consolidate the credibility of legal currency, and at the same time, strictly suppressed the events that disrupt finance to protect the safety of the circulation of legal currency. Regarding the first aspect, Hu Yukun and others have completed the inspection and sealing. Peiping has 15,191,556 yuan in cash, and Tianjin has 36,978,000 yuan, totaling 52,169,650 yuan. Regarding the second aspect, on the 5th of this month, a large number of counterfeit banknotes and machines for making counterfeit banknotes were found at No. 3 University Alley, Jingshan East Street, Peiping, at the residence of Shu Jinghan, the military manager of Newell, a retired US Navy General who has returned to his country. The criminals Shu Runshan, Shu Jinghan, Wang Yunpu, and others were arrested. According to their confessions, they have made a total of 20,000 yuan in counterfeit banknotes. It is not yet known how this case will be handled, but at least it has dealt a great blow to the counterfeit banknote matter.</p>

A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited him yesterday morning. According to him, Chen Jitang dominated Guangdong and only focused on exploiting the people's wealth and expanding the army. His various absurd actions have long been abandoned by the people of the country. Now he is still trying to convene a fake extraordinary meeting, using a group of reactionary elements, even traitors are accepted. How can Mr. Xiao Focheng go with the flow?

My brother's mission is to pacify Baiyue, save the country and the nation from danger, and save 30 million compatriots in Guangdong from water and fire. The news has spread far and wide, and the sea is admiring it.

He went straight back to his private residence on West Aisi Road to rest. At noon yesterday, he went to the Central Bank to handle important matters and met with Mele and, the Chief Inspector of Customs, and Song Ziliang, the General Manager of the National Goods Bank, and many others. According to Kong, (1) Regarding Chen Jitang's attempt to intercept Guangdong Customs duties, it is only a rumor. It is thought that it is advocated by his subordinates who do not understand things. The Guangdong Customs duties are transferred by the Guangdong Customs Tax Office and the Guangzhou Branch of the Bank of China to the General Tax Office at any time. In fact, there is no excess money to be deducted except for the payment of expenses, compensation, foreign debts, and domestic debts. Moreover, the money is deposited into the bank by the Tax Office. How can others be allowed to withdraw it? (2) During this Guangdong and Guangxi incident, not only senior Guangdong military officers such as Director Yu (Hanmou) did not do what he did, but even general middle and lower-level officers and soldiers opposed it. They all know that as soldiers, they must serve the country and cannot be used for private conspiracies. The distinction between obedience and disobedience is very clear. An examination of the armies of various countries in the world, although stationed in various places, their serial numbers and salaries are all subject to the central government and are completely the army of the country. Although there is a distinction between the size of military positions, they are all national military officers. Although soldiers take obedience as their duty, if their superiors obey the orders of the central government, they should obey. Otherwise, the orders of their superiors are chaotic orders, and their subordinates will not blindly follow them. The performance of the Guangdong army this time proves that our country's soldiers have made much progress compared to the past. It is really the best phenomenon in our country at present. According to this observation, I believe that the Guangdong situation can be resolved in the near future, and I believe that there will never be any internal strife in China in the future, and it will enter a peaceful and unified situation. Our country is now governed by the party, and everything is decided by the highest organ of the party, the Central Executive Committee. In this Plenary Session, all parties actively participated and were able to eliminate prejudices and work together in harmony. They all took the overall interests of the country and the future of the nation as the premise. Therefore, the result of the Plenary Session is so good. In particular, during this Guangdong and Guangxi incident, the public opinion of the people across the country unanimously condemned their absurd translations. It is not comparable to the fact that people often rejoiced and watched from the sidelines whenever there was an incident in the past. The people of Guangdong Province have always valued their hometown friendship. This time, they also called on to oppose what Chen and others have done. It can be seen that the psychology of the Chinese people has also made progress compared to the past. At the same time, it gave the military and political authorities of all provinces a lesson. If our daily facilities are for the country and the people, we will definitely be supported by the people. Otherwise, no matter what, we will be abandoned by the people. Although temporary power is used, many acts of injustice will lead to self-destruction, and it will be difficult to obtain a good end, etc.</p>

<p>Central News Agency said, Fellow Guangdong Townsmen in Shanghai are extremely angry recently because the Guangxi Army entered Guangdong Province without authorization to help Chen Jitang promote civil war. They will hold a general meeting of all Guangdong townsmen in Shanghai in the near future to announce Chen Jitang's crimes in Guangdong and denounce the Guangxi Army's erroneous actions.</p>
<h3 id="e113">National Games Sends Letters to Chambers of Commerce Everywhere, Encouraging the Purchase and Use of National Goods <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai National Goods Movement Federation has been making every effort to promote and encourage the use of national goods. Recently, in view of the fact that the market is flooded with private goods, the domestic goods industry has been greatly affected. It is particularly necessary to study and assist in the investigation. Therefore, the domestic group of the federation has started to investigate the production and sales of national goods industries. The first thing they started was the electric light bulb industry. The investigation results showed that although the domestic light bulb industry has made great progress in recent years, it has been greatly affected by the devaluation and dumping of foreign goods. Therefore, the executive committee of the federation passed a resolution to send letters to chambers of commerce in all provinces, cities, and counties to actively promote the production of light bulbs and persuade merchants not to be deceived by foreign merchants. These letters have been sent out yesterday. It is heard that the federation also has measures to assist various national goods industries in promotion. All national goods industries that are significantly declining due to the impact of foreign goods dumping may also request the federation to assist them. The original letter is recorded as follows: Dear Sir, I humbly believe that promoting national goods is the duty of every citizen, and the initiation and promotion depend on the advocacy of advanced members of society. Recently, the problem of smuggling has become increasingly serious, and the national industry is almost collapsing. In this extraordinary period, the responsibility of all individuals or groups who are enthusiastic about promoting national goods is particularly important. Our association is composed of national goods organizations in Shanghai. The internal parts are divided into three groups: domestic, foreign, and general affairs. According to the recent investigation by our domestic group, taking electric light bulbs as an example, the annual consumption scene is 17 million pieces, worth 8 million yuan. In recent years, domestic light bulbs have made rapid progress. Whether in terms of quality or effectiveness, they are not only comparable to imported products, but also have a tendency to surpass them. However, foreigners' economic aggression is meticulous. Foreign light bulbs on the market originally came from Europe and the United States, and are now manufactured in Shanghai. In order to concentrate their efforts and dump national goods light bulbs, they formed a joint business office. The dumping method is to repackage the substandard light bulbs discarded from old foreign brands and sell them with new brand names. The quality of the situation can be imagined. However, due to the particularly low price (from four jiao per piece to two jiao one cent), some compatriots are deceived by it and purchase and use it in large numbers. They do not know that due to its quality, it consumes more electricity and is often easily damaged, which is a loss. Domestic manufacturers and compatriots who purchase and use it suffer. Based on the results of the investigation, our association submitted it to the executive committee meeting for approval and sent letters to chambers of commerce in all provinces, cities, and counties to actively promote domestic light bulbs and persuade merchants not to be deceived by foreign merchants. I sincerely admire your chamber of commerce's leadership of merchants and the people, working hard in commercial transportation, and achieving great results. You are even more enthusiastic about the promotion and guidance of national goods. Therefore, I have separately listed the brand names of domestic light bulbs. I hope that you will carefully study them and ask you to inform merchants and the people not to sell foreign light bulbs again, so that the national goods can be preserved, and the national financial lifeline can be maintained. If you can inform us of the processing and the opinions on the quality and sales of domestic light bulbs, so that we can inform the factories to improve, it will be a public feeling.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Two Points from the Federation of Labor Unions Concerning Revision of the Income Tax Regulations; Instrument, Stationery, and Other Trade Associations Also Present Five Reasons for Tax Exemption <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese General Federation of Industry and Commerce, yesterday submitted a document to the Nanjing Central Political Conference, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance, stating: "Yesterday, we read in the newspaper that the Legislative Yuan had passed the Provisional Income Tax Regulations. Upon careful reading, we believe that citizens have a duty to pay taxes, and if it does not harm the people's livelihood and benefits the national economy, there is no reason not to contribute. However, several points in the regulations have a significant impact on the people's livelihood and the future of industry and commerce. We have no choice but to implore your esteemed council and ministry to revise them. We respectfully submit the reasons, listed below: (1) Dividends from company stocks should no longer be taxed. Category 1, Item A stipulates that the income from profits of companies, shops, firms, factories, or individuals with capital of 2,000 yuan or more should be taxed at different levels. As shareholders are the constituent members of a company, the tax paid on the company's profits is actually levied on the shareholders. Now, Category 3 stipulates that interest from stocks should be taxed separately, which is a duplication. Individuals or partnerships who open shops, firms, factories, and do not issue stocks, the tax is levied on the profits of their shops, firms, and factories, and they cannot be taxed separately from their individual or partnered shareholders. The same profit, whether from individual capital or partnership, is taxed only once. However, companies registered in accordance with the law, in addition to paying income tax on their company, also have to pay income tax on stock dividends, levied on their shareholders. From a tax perspective, this is clearly a double tax; in terms of principles, it is also unfair. Furthermore, most wealthy Chinese people prefer to deposit their money in banks, and only a small number invest in industry and commerce. Therefore, various organizations in this city have requested to lower the interest rates on deposits to promote industry and commerce. According to the regulations of the income tax law, those who deposit in banks are taxed once, and those who invest in industrial and commercial companies, the company's profits are already taxed, and the stock dividends are taxed again. If the interest is deposited in the bank, it must be taxed again, totaling three taxations. Comparing those who deposit in banks with those who invest in industry and commerce, who will be willing to invest in industry and commerce in the future? Our country's industry and commerce are already in extreme decline, and even maintaining and promoting them is fraught with challenges. Now, imposing overlapping taxes is tantamount to dealing a major blow to the industrial and commercial sectors. (2) Savings deposits deducted periodically from the salaries of employees working in various factories should be tax-exempt. Category 3, Item B stipulates that the statutory savings of civil servants and laborers are already tax-exempt, and the savings deposits deducted periodically from the salaries of employees working in various factories should receive the same treatment and be tax-exempt. Employees who work in factories after being hired work hard all year round, equivalent to laborers, and their salaries and wages are mostly meager, far less than those of civil servants. Their usual income is often insufficient to cover expenses, and they have no savings. Once they lose their jobs, they are at risk of starvation. Because the current government has not yet implemented unemployment relief, various factories in the country have a practice of periodically deducting savings deposits from each person's salary and wages, paying preferential interest rates. This savings deposit is the result of frugality and is intended for unemployment or unexpected needs. Its situation is equivalent to labor savings deposits and more difficult than civil servant savings deposits, and it should be equally tax-exempt to demonstrate fairness. The above three points have a profound impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. We respectfully present the facts and appeal to your esteemed council and ministry to consider the difficulties of the people and grant revisions. We eagerly await your response. Sincerely, The Chinese General Federation of Industry and Commerce."</p>
<p>The instrument and stationery industry, the new drug industry, the book industry, and other trade associations in this city jointly sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating: "We read in the newspaper that the Legislative Yuan had passed the Provisional Income Tax Regulations. Upon careful reading, we believe that citizens have a duty to pay taxes, and if it does not harm the people's livelihood and benefits the national economy, there is no reason not to contribute. Now, several points in the income tax regulations have a significant impact on the people's livelihood and the future of industry and commerce, and we have no choice but to implore your esteemed chamber to forward this to the government and appeal on our behalf: (1) Category 2, Item A, which taxes five cents for every ten yuan of monthly average income from thirty to sixty yuan, should be canceled. (2) Interest from stocks should not be taxed again as income tax. (3) Savings deposits deducted periodically from the salaries of employees and shop assistants working in various industries should be tax-exempt. (4) Income from author's royalties should be tax-exempt. (5) Compensation received from various insurance policies should be tax-exempt. The above five points have a profound impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. Our associations are deeply aware of the suffering of the people, and we cannot remain silent about what we perceive as dangerous. We respectfully request your esteemed chamber to forward this to the government and appeal for consideration of the difficulties of the people and grant revisions, etc."</p>

<h3 id="e117">Representatives of the Sauce Industry from Five Provinces Petition the Salt Affairs General Office Yesterday, Requesting Balanced Market Prices and Crackdown on Toxic Substances; Result: Permission to Thoroughly Investigate and Reduce the Price of Sauce Salt <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The sauce industry from five provinces, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei, petitioned the Salt Affairs Audit General Office yesterday because the Ministry of Finance had approved on September 4th of last year to crack down on tax-free toxic soy sauce, and to order salt merchants to balance the prices of sauce salt and edible salt. The order had been issued for a long time, but it had not been implemented. Therefore, the industry gathered representatives from various places yesterday to petition the Salt Affairs Audit General Office again. As a result, permission was granted for a thorough investigation, and approval was given to balance salt prices. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives from Various Places Come to Shanghai to Petition</p>
<p>Representatives of the sauce industry from five provinces, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei, including Wu Yinzhi and Chen Weiwen from the Shanghai Sauce Garden Trade Association, Fan Zishu and Wang Qingqing from Wu County, Zhu Ren'an from Songjiang, Zhang Bingjun from Wujin, Gao Yongni and Tu Xi from Zhenjiang, Liu Zhuyun, Cai Fengxiang, and Zhao Huiqing from Taicang, Mei Kuibo from Jiaxing, Fang Zhongfu from Baoshan, Ding Huchen from Wuxi, Tan Junyi and Jiang Dashi from Danyang, Wu Yongqing, Ling Zhenqing, Qiu Xie as representatives of the United Association of Sauce Industry Trade Associations of Zhejiang Province, Ru, Yao Ganqing, Chen Disun from Shaoxing, Ma Zhibi, Zhou Yiqi from Yuyao, Wang Youzhang, Shen Suishi from Ningbo, Chen Ronghuo from Zhenhai, Shi Zhechen from Nanxun, Niu Yansheng and Bian Juean from Linghu, Wu Jianqing and Shen Zihua from Xinshi, Shen Dade, Wu Shaolu, Lu Shoupeng, and Qian Wenbing from Changxing, Ma Shuliu and Ren Difan from Shuanglin, Ma Junming and Zhu Ziqing from Haiyan, Dai Songkou from Hangzhou, Wang Zhongchi from Xiaoshi, Huang Defu from Jintai, Qu Benhuai from Wuhu, Wu Rongli from Huaining, Wang Dongyou from Dangtu Xuancheng, Wang Wenchang from He County, and Zhai Yinting from Hankou, a total of forty-eight representatives, have all come to Shanghai to petition.</p>
<p>Request to Crack Down on Counterfeit Soy Sauce</p>
<p>The representatives arrived at the Salt Affairs Audit General Office of this port yesterday morning to request an audience with Director Zhu Tingqi. Zhu assigned General Affairs Section Chief Feng Ruliang to receive them. Because there were many representatives and it was inconvenient, Wu Kuanyi was elected to state the purpose and submit a petition, requesting strict punishment for the counterfeit soy sauce. The Ministry of Finance's order has not been effectively enforced due to the lack of appropriate measures, leading to prolonged neglect and aggravation. Furthermore, the raw material is saltpeter, which is intended for industrial use, and is now being sold in the same way as heavily taxed soy sauce factories. It should be taxed the same as official salt. If the current chemical tests show that it contains toxic substances, it should be strictly prohibited. Section Chief Feng replied that he would immediately transfer the matter for strict handling to maintain government orders.</p>
<p>Balancing Salt Prices Does Not Allow Ambiguity</p>
<p>Furthermore, the price of sauce salt is higher than that of edible salt by one yuan and three jiao and four fen per dan. The Ministry of Finance has ordered salt merchants to balance the prices, but they have not complied. Now that the national tax has been fixed (at seven yuan and two jiao per dan), the salt price should not allow ambiguity. If they still resist, sauce factories should be allowed to purchase official salt with the same tax rate from nearby salt warehouses to avoid manipulation by salt merchants. Feng replied that he would follow the instructions of the Ministry of Finance and instruct the Songjiang Salt Transport Deputy Office to strictly order salt merchants to balance the prices and prevent the sauce industry from suffering huge losses. The representatives were satisfied and returned.</p>

The Municipal Council has decided to submit this case to the Board of Directors for consideration. After the Board of Directors has discussed and made a decision, it will formally propose negotiations to our side. However, no matter how the case changes in the future, our Municipal Government will adhere to its established policy and vigorously contend for the right of inspection sovereignty over Chinese and foreign factories within the Concession area, and will never compromise or lose it.</p>

<p>The China United Association of Navigation and Drivers, formerly for the National Assembly delegate election, how to participate, submitted a request to the Ministry of Transportation for instructions, and has now received a reply from the Ministry of Transportation: "Your report has been received. The attached table four of the National Assembly delegate election law clearly lists the names of free professional groups. Since the Association is not listed among the free professional groups, it obviously cannot directly elect representatives to participate as a group. Furthermore, the nature of the Association is similar to that of a labor union, but the scope, content, and establishment procedures of the organization have not followed the regulations of the Labor Union Law and the Implementing Law of the Labor Union Law. As for whether it can be considered a professional group participating in the election of labor union representatives in the locality, you should directly request an explanation from the local administrative agency. Let it be known accordingly."</p>

<p>The Central News Agency reports that the flour market in this city was previously too volatile. In order to stabilize it, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs specially set price limits for flour from near and far periods. Recently, the market has become calm, and there has been talk of lifting the price limits. A reporter from the Central News Agency inquired with relevant parties yesterday and learned that the authorities have indicated that they will extend the price limits. The nearby flour in the "July," "August," and "September" recent periods will be extended by seven cents, meaning that the highest price should not exceed three yuan and twelve cents. The far-term flour prices in "October," "November," and "December" will also be extended by one jiao. It is likely that official documents will arrive tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. It has also been learned that a certain foreign businessman in Hankou has been buying wheat in large quantities, causing the wheat price to rise, and the flour price will inevitably rise at the same time due to the rising raw material prices.</p>

<p>After the League of Nations resolved to lift sanctions against Italy, our country also received an order to implement it and complied with the revocation starting on the 15th. The Ministry of Finance instructed the Jianghai Customs to implement it. A reporter from the Ta Kung Pao inquired with the Customs about the amount of trade losses between China and Italy during the sanctions against Italy. It is understood that our country's trade with Italy is not significant, accounting for a very small number, only about ten million yuan per year. Our exports to Italy are mainly cloth, tea, etc., while Italy's imports to China are mainly artificial silk, woolen cloth, etc. It is still difficult to estimate the losses since the implementation of economic sanctions against Italy, but it is estimated to be only three or four million yuan. There has been no significant impact on customs revenue.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Temporary Working Hours Issues: Ministry Approves Handling According to Law <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The cotton spinning labor unions in the ten districts of this city have noticed that employers recently hire workers and give them temporary work permits. Even if they continue to work in the factory for more than three months, they are still regarded as temporary workers so that they can be dismissed at will. The factory law does not clearly stipulate the period for employing temporary workers, and it is difficult to negotiate. Therefore, on April 14, they submitted a request to the Bureau of Social Affairs to forward it to the Ministry of Industry to interpret the provisions of Articles 27 and 29 of the factory law, asking whether they can also be applied to temporary workers who continue to work in the factory for more than three months. Now, they have received approval from the Ministry of Industry (Labor Letter No. 4927): "Your report has been received. The temporary work permits issued by the Shenxin No. 1 Textile Factory in Shanghai do not specify a period. If the worker continues to work in the factory for more than three months, it can be handled according to the Interpretation No. 1155 of the Judicial Yuan. If the oral contract does not specify a period, the provisions of Article 20 of the Factory Law should be applied accordingly. In addition to instructing the Shanghai Bureau of Social Affairs to transfer the instructions to comply with the previous report, let it be known accordingly."</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government has established a Vegetable Cattle Inspection Office within the jurisdiction of this city to inspect and re-verify the procedures for smuggled cattle transported to Shanghai from Jiangsu Province to facilitate inspection and re-verification. Unexpectedly, after the establishment of the office, it drafted a method for reporting cattle slaughter verification in the urban area, levied a per-head transit tax, detained cattle, forced donations, issued cattle driving permits for cattle dealers, and levied cattle transit tax. These actions hindered the effectiveness of the city's slaughter inspection and the city's issued permits, infringing on the city's jurisdiction. The Municipal Government repeatedly consulted the Jiangsu Provincial Government and ordered the bureau to handle it carefully and not to exceed the scope. Now, it is heard that the City Party Department has received a report from the Tenth District Party Department, stating that the office has repeatedly exceeded its authority and levied transit tax, and asked whether it is legal to send a letter to the Health Bureau for inquiries. Subsequently, the bureau replied that the Jiangsu Provincial Government had stipulated the office's task as inspecting and re-verifying cattle procedures, and had again ordered the office to comply and not to exceed the scope. After receiving the letter, the City Party Department has instructed the ten district party departments to be notified.</p>

Those who went to the meeting at that time either served as fundraisers or personally made donations. After listening to the lecture, they were all greatly moved and expressed their willingness to continue to serve the motherland's famine administration. It is heard that Mr. Luo stayed in Honolulu for a total of nine days, giving lectures on disaster administration to the Zhongshan Middle School, the Pacific International Society, and various Christian groups, and broadcasting on the Honolulu Radio Station.

<p>New Voice Society reports: Following the Shanghai Municipal Council's statement regarding Huadong (Eastern Shanghai) slum resident mediation led by Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing, slum representatives Wang Qitai, Sun Hankui, Tang Anping, Xu Xiguang, and others recounted the events: "On Tuesday afternoon at 2 PM, we went to Mr. Yu's office at the Sanbei Company. He told us, 'I'm going to a meeting today. Come back at 5 PM for an answer.' When we returned at 5 PM, Mr. Yu said, 'They won't be demolished. You can go back.' There are conditions, though (not recorded further). The fundamental question is whether you can or cannot do it. After receiving this response, we rushed back to organize a neighborhood mutual guarantee system to ensure no further expansion. We jointly signed a pledge."</p>
<p>Submitted to the Housing Problem Committee for Discussion</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office announced: "Considering the sweltering heat and out of compassion for the toiling poor, the Council has agreed to postpone the relocation date until the autumn coolness. Whether or not to eliminate the slums and the attitude the Council should adopt are now submitted to the Housing Problem Committee for discussion, as the slum disposal issue was originally within the Committee's scope of discussion." However, yesterday the Shanghai Municipal Council also sent letters to slum residents on Haizhou Road, Helong Road, Huinan Road, and other locations, ordering them to relocate by August 6th of next month. The original text reads: "Shanghai Municipal Council Notice. Regarding the matter of this notice, the location of these shacks on Helong Road and Huinan Road is on or near Land Deeds No. 7545 and 7546. This Council orders that these shacks must be relocated before August 6, 1936. Otherwise, we will immediately demolish them. This notice is hereby given."</p>
<p>Petitioning and Negotiating with Various Parties Again</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, slum representatives Jia Zidong, Wang Daoyi, Guo Bingzhi, Yang Jinda, and over twenty others prepared documents to petition Yu Qiaqing, the First Special District Citizen's Association, and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession. Their letter to Mr. Yu reads: "Philanthropist Yu, we slum dwellers often trouble you. We feel deeply sorry because we suffer from having no money and no good jobs. We rely solely on our legs and hands, working all day long to earn a bowl of thin congee. That's why we build a shack to live in. Who with money would live in a shack? We truly have no other choice. The day before yesterday, thanks to your kind intercession with the Municipal Council, they agreed not to demolish our homes. We were overjoyed. But now, the Municipal Council has posted notices of relocation west of Haizhou Road. Upon hearing this, we truly feel lost. Whatever conditions, we can fulfill, as long as they don't demolish our homes. Alas, philanthropist, we are not guilty of any crime. Our landlords are not building houses nor designating relocation sites. Are they telling us to live on the streets, rob, or beg? Therefore, we have come again to ask you, philanthropist, to inquire with the Municipal Council whether they will demolish or require us to form a mutual guarantee association to avoid becoming wandering ghosts."</p>

<p>Mr. Yang Chonggao, the secretary of the recently dispatched Nanyang (Southeast Asia) inspection delegation, is a pioneer in China's vocational education sector. For years, he has presided over the China Vocational Guidance Center, contributing greatly to society. He has also consistently worked hard to promote the production and sale of domestic goods. Recently, he raised 50,000 yuan in capital to acquire the entire Golden Camel Fountain Pen Manufacturing Company, previously owned by Mr. Pan Qianxing, as well as all its vacuum pen patent rights. He renamed it the Da Wen Fountain Pen Factory, assuming the position of manager himself. He is manufacturing and selling Da Wen brand vacuum pens, whose quality has improved significantly compared to the previous Golden Camel brand, completely eliminating the ink suction difficulties. Currently, in addition to taking samples directly to various ports in Nanyang for promotion, Mr. Yang has also produced a large batch of finished goods, offering them at low prices to domestic stationery merchants for wholesale purchase. Furthermore, Mr. Yang, recognizing the increasingly serious unemployment problem among young men and women, plans to establish a fountain pen manufacturing technology training center. Within a short period, he will train them to become skilled in the technology and mass-produce Da Wen brand affordable and popular pens. They can then take machines home to work, and the Da Wen factory will pay them a monthly wage of 40 to 100 yuan based on their production speed. If this succeeds, it will provide another outlet for unemployed youth. It is also reported that although Mr. Yang has gone to Nanyang, regarding the wholesale purchase and inquiries about these fountain pens, you can send letters to the factory on Changping Road in this city, where someone will be responsible for answering them.</p>

<p>De Qiu Rengao was previously sued by Xie Xien and his brothers in the First Special District Court to return a 50,000 yuan inheritance, claiming that Rengao was originally surnamed Xie and adopted the Qiu surname upon marrying into the Qiu family, and that he had issued a 50,000 yuan bond. The outside world has referred to this as a lawsuit between those with different surnames but the same ancestry. Details were published in this newspaper on the 1st of this month. After Qiu was summoned, he immediately sued Xie for obstructing his freedom. The Shanghai District Court sentenced Xie to a fine of 50 yuan for using violence and coercion to force someone to perform an obligation, with a two-year suspended sentence. Xie appealed, but the High Court rejected the appeal. Initially, the civil division of the First Special District Court ruled to suspend the proceedings because Qiu had filed a private lawsuit. Now that the criminal case is settled, the hearing was rescheduled. It was heard that the plaintiffs (i.e., Xie Xien, etc.) had applied to withdraw the case several days earlier, so the court did not open. Thus, the lawsuit between those with different surnames but the same ancestry is now concluded.</p>

<p>According to Da Gong She, the Chinese pigment market has been monopolized by Germany and the United Kingdom in recent years. Recently, two Japanese pigment companies with medium capital have been trying to restore their position in the Chinese pigment market and avoid China's 100% ad valorem people's tax by establishing branches in Shanghai to manufacture vulcanized black and water blue. One is the Oazaki Dyeing and Weaving Company, with a capital of 1,000,000 yuan, which has a factory in Osaka. The other is the Hiroshima Prefecture Samsung Pigment Company, with a capital of 2,500,000 yuan. In addition to the above two factories, the Japanese Pigment Manufacturing Factory, known as the most natural pigment factory in Japan and with a capital of 5,000,000 yuan, also plans to establish a branch in China to manufacture various pigments. The Ozaki Weaving Company recently took over a Chinese chemical industrial factory in Shanghai and is now installing equipment to manufacture vulcanized black and water blue. This new factory will operate as an independent company, named the De Kang Pigment Factory, with the aim of supplying the needs of various textile companies in central China. The Samsung Pigment Company has also purchased a factory owned by a Chinese businessman in Shanghai and established the Sanhe Pigment Engineering Company, which is jointly operated by Chinese merchants and the well-known Osaka pigment merchant Miki Shoten. The Sanji Company is in charge of the engineering technology, while the capital is raised by Chinese merchants and Miki Shoten. This company will mainly specialize in the manufacture of vulcanized black.</p>

<p>Pirates have become rampant outside the Wusong Sanjiashui Estuary, with frequent reports of robberies of pig boats and fishing boats. The other day, the Ningbo fishing boat "Jin Tong Hua," Customs Seal No. 1432, was transporting miscellaneous goods from Hankou to Shanghai. The boat arrived at the sea area opposite Jiangbei New Port on the afternoon of the day before yesterday when it was suddenly encountered by a pirate ship. The pirates fired two shots as a warning, forcing the boat to stop. Eleven pirates, armed with five rifles, swarmed onto the boat, first confining the crew in a cabin, using the plaster of Paris that was loaded on board to hold them down and prevent them from moving, and then began to loot. They took 29 pieces of tung oil, two cans of camphor oil, five pieces of piqiao wood, seven pieces of hemp, and 160 yuan in cash, as well as dozens of pieces of clothing. The total loss was estimated at around 2,000 yuan. Afterwards, the fishing boat owner reported the incident to the Third District Water Police of Nantong and requested an investigation. The boat arrived in Song yesterday and reported the incident to the Xia Senji Customs Brokerage to request that it be reported to the Jianghai Customs and other agencies to request that the stolen goods be recovered and the pirates brought to justice. It is heard that the tung oil that was robbed was marked with the Chun Yuan brand and belonged to the Ningbo Changyuan Xiehao.

<p>The city has been experiencing continuous strong winds and heavy rain, and the weather is similar to late autumn. Yesterday afternoon, it was dark for half an hour, followed by a downpour. An hour later, the rain eased slightly. Overall, the weather from morning to dusk yesterday was rainy, and the temperature was cooler than the day before. The Huangpu River surface was hit by wind and waves, causing the river water to backflow, and water accumulated to a foot deep in low-lying areas on the roads. Shanghai's export cargo ships were greatly affected. Goods such as piece goods, yarn, sugar, paper, and cigarettes, which were scheduled to be loaded and transported to various ports along the Yangtze River, were temporarily halted due to fears of being soaked by the heavy rain. Some cargo was delayed due to the inability of dockworkers to load the ships. North-South Ocean, Small Yangtze, and Ningbo ships were also subject to the same obstruction. The number of outbound passengers on each ship was greatly reduced. Overall, in the past two days, cargo transportation on the Jianghai routes has decreased by 60%, and the number of passengers has decreased by half. The shipping industry is quite distressed. According to news from the Observatory yesterday, rainfall this year is higher than the same period last year. The amount of rainfall from January 1st to 12 PM on the 16th of this month has been 599.8 millimeters. The rainfall yesterday is not included. Last year, the amount of rainfall during the same period was 547.8 millimeters, which is 52 millimeters less. (Note that last year's rainfall was more than the same period the year before.) If the weather does not clear up, agricultural crops will likely suffer.</p>

At 8 AM yesterday morning, the police escorted the three defendants, Ye, Yang, and Zhou, to the First Tribunal of the First Special Court. The security was still very tight, and there were still several Japanese military officers and armed soldiers in court to observe. Shortly after, Presiding Judge Qian Hongye, Judges Xiao Xiefen and Feng Shide, Prosecutor Zhang Zongru, and Clerk Ding Huaji took their seats and ordered the defendants to be brought to the stand. Presiding Judge Qian then announced that the debate had been adjourned and concluded, and that the court would set another date to reopen the debate, stating that because the police had continued to produce evidence after the debate had been concluded, the debate must be reopened. However, the court needed time to summon witnesses, which would take time, so the date for reopening the debate could not be specified in court. They would be notified after the witnesses were summoned. He ordered the three defendants to be taken back to the police station for detention. It is feared that there will be further developments in this case.</p>

Due to not understanding insurance regulations, or neglecting prior considerations, or not understanding the conditions to be observed during the effective period of the contract, or not knowing the proper steps to take after an accident, the reason is that both the usual waste of excessive premiums, increasing unnecessary burdens, and in case of damage, not being able to obtain appropriate compensation, resulting in a majority of serious and difficult recoveries.

It is said that this kind of service organization is still the first in the country, and its fees are extremely low, and in the future, it will benefit China's insurance industry, which should not be small.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Wang Qiyuan's Frame-Up Case Involving Red Pills - Harming Others Hurts Themselves <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Shishan native Wang Qiyuan (also known as Wang Zhongyin) once worked as an apprentice and accountant at the Tongtai North Goods Store jointly opened by Ye Fubao (also known as Hu Xiaozhou) and his father Wang Taosheng. He was later dismissed for embezzlement and ordered to return the embezzled funds, which led to resentment and a long-planned revenge. In early March of this year (lunar calendar), Wang Qiyuan came to Shanghai and stayed at the Yangtze River Hotel, where he met Zhang Hancheng (also known as Zhang Ahu), a fellow villager who worked as a tea boy at the hotel. He discussed a plan to buy red pills and frame someone. In early March (leap month), Zhang Hancheng went to Wang Qiyuan's Shanghai residence at No. 5 Zhongde Lane, Qinglian Street, and Wang Qiyuan gave him 52 yuan, instructing him to buy 8,000 red pills (8 packets of 1,000 pills each) from Yang Datou, who sold red pills, according to the previously agreed plan. He then returned to No. 5 Zhongde Lane and handed them over to Wang Qiyuan. Wang immediately took the red pills back to his home in Dingjiaqiao, Baoshan, and hid them in the spare room rented to Yang Wenbing, secretly planning to implement the frame-up. On one hand, he claimed that there were red pill wholesale agencies in Baoshan, Shanghai, and other places. He asked Chen Bin, whom Zhang Hancheng knew (Chen Bin was a former inspector of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's water patrol team and is now unemployed), to introduce him to Song Faxiang, and Yang Wenbing to be the accuser, issuing a written report. Chen Bin was the introducer, and Wang Qiyuan was the scribe. They waited to find out the location where the red pills were hidden before notifying them to report to Faixiang to report the crime. Later, according to Song Faxiang, there were red pill wholesale agencies near Shanghai, etc. When reporting to the Songhu Garrison Command, Wang Qiyuan learned that Ye Fubao's Shanghai residence, No. 148 Shangwen Road, Ximen, had a doctor, Wang Jianxiong, who rented the downstairs wing room as a medical room. On the afternoon of May 19, Wang Qiyuan took 3,000 red pills and led Zhang Hancheng and Yang Wenbing to Ye's house. Temporarily, Zhang Hancheng pretended to be sick and went to seek treatment. When Wang Qiyuan arrived at the gate of Ye's house, he handed 3,000 red pills to Yang Wenbing to enter, while Wang left on his own. At that time, there was only the nurse Tao Xingzhen in the medical room. While talking to the nurse, Yang Wenbing and Zhang Hancheng took the opportunity to throw 3,000 red pills handed over by Wang Qiyuan into the wooden plaque of the living room and escaped. Then, Chen Bin, together with Yang Wenbing, went to Song Faxiang to inform him that the red pill agency had been found. Song Faxiang reported to the Command Investigation Team by telephone. The Command sent investigators to supervise Song Faxiang, Yang Wenbing, and Ren Songlin, who was temporarily instructed by Song Faxiang to guard Yang Wenbing's eyeliner. They went to Ye Fubao's house to search and seized 3,000 red pills planted in the wooden plaque in the living room. The investigation team suspected something else and immediately took Song Faxiang, Chen Bin, Yang Wenbing, Ren Songlin, together with Ye Fubao's daughter-in-law Ye Baoshi (Hu Baoshi), and maid Zhuang Huibao, and other witnesses, to the team to interrogate. According to Yang Wenbing's confession, the truth was told. He said that the red pills were handed over and thrown in by Wang Qiyuan and Zhang Hancheng. There were still 5,000 red pills left in the original place in the countryside of Baoshan. Later, they went to Yang's house in Dingjiaqiao, Baoshan, and recovered the remaining 5,000 red pills from the planting. Zhang Hancheng and Wang Qiyuan were detained and sent to the team. According to Wang Qiyuan's confession, the circumstances of the frame-up were clear. Zhang Hancheng also confessed to the process of buying the pills and planting them. The team first allowed the victims Hu Baoshi and others to be released on bail and sent Song Faxiang and others, together with the 8,000 red pills seized, to the Command for handling. After detailed interrogation by the Military Law Department of the Command, they were sentenced to Wang Qiyuan (Wang Zhongyin), Zhang Hancheng (Zhang Ahu), and Yang Wenbing for jointly framing others with red pills for selling. Wang Qiyuan was sentenced to 15 years of fixed-term imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for ten years. Zhang Hancheng and Yang Wenbing were each sentenced to 12 years of fixed-term imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for ten years. Harming others harmed themselves under the law. This can be used as a warning for those who intend to frame others.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Case of the Assassination of Tang Youren - Continued Trial of Suspects - The Police Request a Postponement Because the Investigation Procedures Have Not Been Completed - All Defendants Unanimously Deny Participation in the Assassination <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Former Minister of Foreign Affairs Tang Youren, a native of Hunan, was assassinated in front of his residence on Gansidong Road in the French Concession on the evening of December 25 last year. The French Police Department issued a general order to arrest the murderer, but to no avail. Recently, the Public Police Department arrested six robbers, Wang Guifu, Peng Renjie, Zhang Shilin, Yuan Youqiao, Gu Xiaohu, and Qiu Jiyu, last month. A pistol was seized. After the gun examination office verified that the gun was the same as the murder weapon in the Tang case, the case was reported to the First Special Court, which sentenced them to the crime of robbery. The French Police Department was notified and detectives were sent to bring the bandits back. On the 4th of this month, they were escorted to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. All details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday was the date for the continued trial. At 9 a.m., Criminal Court President Wang Wangxu, accompanied by clerk Gao Yanmao, came to Criminal Court 1 to continue the trial. Defendant Peng Renjie was seriously ill with syphilis in detention and was sent to the hospital for treatment. He was unable to appear in court. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the Police Department, claimed to the court that the case was important and extremely complicated, so the investigation procedures had not been completed. The main criminal, Xiao Hangzhou, had fled to Hankou, and the detectives sent to arrest him had not returned. He requested that the detention period be extended for another two weeks. Defendant Qiu Jiyu stated that when Tang Youren was killed, he was in Hangzhou. The police are investigating, but it is not true. He was in Hangzhou in February of this year. He asked the court to pay attention to this point. The court ordered Detective Shi Qing, who was handling the case, to be brought to court to report on the investigation. Shi said that the detectives who arrested the fugitive Xiao Hangzhou had not yet returned to Shanghai. The police must strictly investigate this case. The court then questioned the four defendants, Wang Duifu, Zhang Shilin, Yuan Youqiao, and Gu Xiaohu. They said that they were all in their hometowns on December 25 of last year and knew nothing about the Tang Youren assassination. The robbery case was also a wrongful arrest. Qiu Jiyu confessed to participating in the Xiaoshadu Road robbery. The pistol was given to him by the fugitive Xiao Hangzhou during the robbery. He did not know where the gun came from. He knew nothing about the killing of Tang Youren. The defendants also claimed to the court that the treatment in the police station was poor and requested to be transferred to the detention center. They requested permission to file an appeal against the sentence of imprisonment for robbery by the First Special Court, otherwise the appeal period would be delayed. After verifying the confessions, the court ordered that the case be postponed to the 31st for another trial. The defendants were still returned to the police station, and the detectives handling the case were instructed to obtain confessions from the defendants using proper procedures and to assist them in filing appeals. After the instructions, the court adjourned.</p>

The patrol officer on duty at the scene rushed to the scene and sent Xu to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Gu Yaosheng, a local resident, is 44 years old and lives at No. 3, Lane 64, Caojiaqiao, Hardoon Road. At about 4 p.m. yesterday afternoon, Gu was out on business and was walking near Yaoan Corner, Xujiahui, when he was suddenly attacked by two robbers. Gu immediately shouted for help, which angered the robbers, who pulled out a gun and fired a shot at him, hitting Gu Yaosheng in the left leg. He fell to the ground in extreme pain. The robbers, seeing that they had caused an incident, escaped without robbing anything. The nearby patrol officers heard the sound and rushed to the scene, but the robbers were already far away. They had no choice but to send the injured person to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e167">A Westerner Dies Tragically on Avenue Edward VII - Pistol and Bullet Not Recovered - Possible Suicide - The Deceased's Wife Was Engaged in Prostitution in a Brothel - Gave More Than One Hundred Yuan When They Last Met <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the American Mr. Kevett, who died of a gunshot wound on Avenue Edward VII on Thursday morning, although the pistol that caused the death and the bullet that pierced his chest have not yet been found, judging from the circumstances of the case, the deceased must have committed suicide. The deceased's wife has been engaged in prostitution at a brothel set up by the American woman Ward at No. 52 Avenue Edward VII since January of this year. Although the husband and wife still lived together, the wife often stayed at No. 52 because the deceased had been unemployed for a long time and had no money to make a living. On Thursday morning, at about 10 o'clock, the deceased called his wife and instructed her to wait at the entrance of No. 52. Not long after, the couple met there because the deceased had just returned from Yantai and had some money with him. After a brief conversation, the deceased gave his wife 140 US dollars, saying that if something unexpected happened to him, she could use this money to pay for her trip back to the United States. After saying that, he left. Soon after, the woman heard a gunshot in the distance and was suspicious. Later, at about 4 o'clock, she went out and hired a rickshaw to go along Avenue Edward VII. When she returned home at dawn, although she passed the place where the deceased was lying, she did not see his body. However, she was still uneasy and did not take off her clothes and go to bed. At about 7 o'clock, the servant came in to report that her husband had died on Avenue Edward VII. According to the facts, Mr. Kexi was engaged in gambling in New York before he came to China. At the time of his death, he only had seven copper coins on his body. If someone had not searched his pockets first, he would have given everything to his wife.</p>

<p>The Yu Li Printing House, located at 291 Rue Joffre in the French Concession, is owned by Wu Rongfang from Anhui. The business is quite prosperous, and Mr. Wu also places great emphasis on the education of his workers and apprentices. After the work in the shop is finished, he sends them to Hua Guang Elementary School at 299 Rue Pere Robert to attend night classes and increase their knowledge. However, on the 15th of this month, at around 6 PM, an apprentice named Yan Shanfeng (from Ningbo, 16 years old) went to the school with his companions Gu Xiaodi and Peng Songquan. Seeing that the class time had not yet arrived, Yan and the others played on the swings in the school playground. Unexpectedly, Yan was careless and fell, sustaining serious injuries. He was taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment, where the doctors determined that Yan's injuries were internal and required surgery, which Yan refused. He returned to Yu Li Printing House and sought medical treatment, but it was ineffective. Mr. Wu then sent Yan to Xianglin Hospital at 578 Beijing Road for emergency treatment, but it was to no avail. He died the day before yesterday. The hospital reported the death to the Lao Zha Police Station, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was then transported to the Fei Lun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Zhang Zongru, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and a clerk, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. The examination confirmed that the deceased, Yan Shanfeng, was male and had died from injuries sustained in an accidental fall. The body was handed over to his uncle, Jiang Ziqing, for burial after he signed the necessary documents.</p>

<p>To the Editors, I recently read the article "Production Area Inspection of Qimen and Tunxi Tea Areas Completed" published in your newspaper on July 13th. I found some discrepancies. Although the production area inspection of Qihong tea area has been completed, the production season of Tunxi green tea is longer, and it is still in the production stage and needs to be inspected. Except for Director Fan Hejun, who has temporarily returned to Shanghai for personal reasons, the other inspection personnel have not left Tunxi. I am writing to request that you make the correction. Sincerely, Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, Tea Production Area Inspection Office, Tunxi Office, Ministry of Industry, July 17th.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editors, I recently saw an article titled "New Scam in Shanghai" on page 14 of the fourth section of today's newspaper.

<h3 id="e173">Gang Arrested at Dafang Hotel, Investigation Reveals Plot to Rob Morphine, Two Unrelated Persons Released, Case Concluded and Scheduled for Sentencing on the 23rd <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of the 1st of this month at around 2 AM, Inspector Jiang Futian of the French Police received a tip from an informant that a gang was hiding in room 204 on the second floor of the Dafang Hotel at No. 33 Zhengjia Muqiao. He immediately led the officers on duty to the address and arrested suspects Jin Baofa (35 years old, local, residing at No. 17 Hengmao Lane, Baxianqiao), Guo Yunyou (36 years old, from Hebei, residing upstairs at the Baohua Auto Repair Shop on Wuma Road), Chang Yaoting (29 years old, from Yangzhou, residing at No. 74 Zilaihuo Street), a woman, Xun Wangshi (28 years old, actress, residing at No. 8 Baokang Lane, Beijing Road), Chen Tingsheng (34 years old, from Zhenjiang, residing at No. 26 Yangjia Lane, Julai Road), and confiscated two handguns and 28 bullets. They were escorted to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. This was reported in your newspaper. After investigation, the police found that Dong Wangshi and Chen Tingsheng were not involved and requested the court to release them first. The Police Department prosecuted the three defendants, Jin, Guo, and Chang, for the crime of possessing military firearms with intent to commit a crime under Article 187 of the Criminal Law, and the crime of robbery under Article 328, paragraph 5 of the same law. Yesterday morning at 8 AM, Judge Wang Gangxu presided over the trial in the Criminal Division No. 1. The court first summoned Chen Hanquan and Shen Peichun, tea servers at the Dafang Hotel, as witnesses. They testified that a Mr. Wu came to open room 204 on the afternoon of the 30th of last month. Late at night, three men and a young woman came together and were then arrested. Next, Inspector Jiang Futian of the Police Department, who handled the case, was summoned to the stand and questioned about the process of solving the case. Jiang testified that the defendants had confessed to planning to rob morphine near Zhonghua Lane. Finally, the court questioned the defendant Jin Baofa, who testified that he and Dong Wangshi were playing on the street that night when they met Chang Fukang, who was on the run, and were invited to the Dafang Hotel for a chat and some snacks. They went together. When they arrived in the room, Chang Fukang said his feet itched and took off his socks to take a bath. After he left the room, they were arrested. He did not know there were handguns in the room. He confessed in the police station because he was forced to confess by being doused with tap water and beaten with iron rods. He had never suffered such pain in his thirty-five years of life. Chang Fukang never returned and left a short Xiangyun gauze shirt in the room. Guo Yunyou and Chang Yaoting both testified that they denied the crime of plotting robbery and were framed. After the Police Department's lawyer and the defendants' lawyer Tang Hao debated, the court adjourned and scheduled the sentencing for the morning of the 23rd. The defendants were transferred back to the detention center.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Report on Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Changes in the First Quarter of This Year Edited by Zhu Zheng (30th Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce) <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The following is a list of various changes in Shanghai's industry and commerce in the first three months of this year, with a particular emphasis on noteworthy businesses, listed by month for reference by all sectors of society.</p>
<p>(1) For January The new British-owned Meihua Bank began operations on the 15th of this month, but the official opening date has not yet been announced. The bank was formed by merging with the former Daxin Industrial Bank, which had been operating at 210 Sichuan Road for many years, so it seems more appropriate to list it as an expansion. In the money exchange industry, two companies expanded their capital, two companies reduced their capital, eight companies reorganized, and four companies closed down during this month, according to the Money Exchange Association. The general decline of the money exchange industry last year is noteworthy. In the transportation industry, the Chinese-owned Lili Automobile Company suddenly announced its closure on the 14th. The company was large-scale, with 80 cars, and was known as a leader in the industry. Its impact on the car rental industry was as great as that of the Public Yellow Automobile Company, which closed down in October last year. The reorganization and resumption of operations of the Zhonghua Ming Match Factory in the chemical industry is also noteworthy. The company had been closed for more than a year since it announced its closure at the same time as the Taifeng Canned Food Company in December 1934. In the woolen and foreign goods sales industry, one company contracted and ten companies reorganized this month. This is a large difference compared to the one company that reorganized in November last year, the lack of any reorganization or closure in December, and the one company that reorganized in the same period last year. In addition, the wool and cold storage industry also had considerable changes. In the midst of a trade surplus, it seems that it should not be ignored. The Daxin Co., Ltd., which had been preparing for a long time, announced its opening on the 10th of this month. The company has a total capital of 6 million Hong Kong dollars and its head office is located in Hong Kong. This is a major development in the city's department store industry.</p>
<p>(2) For February The American Express Bank announced the cessation of its banking business in the middle of this month. The bank was the Shanghai branch of the American head office and had been in operation for more than nineteen years. The cessation of banking business is said to be a planned move by the bank to prepare for the expansion of its transportation, travel and other businesses. Baochang Money Exchange is a member of the city's Money Exchange Association, with a capital of 140,000 yuan and a supplementary capital of 140,000 yuan. Its business was generally stable. However, due to the economic downturn and the lack of certainty about the future of the business, the shareholders voluntarily announced the closure. Two more gold shops closed down this month. Since the currency reform last year, nine companies have closed down one after another since April: Jiatai, Yuankangxiang, and Xie Daxiang at the end of October; Juchangyuan, Yongyi, and Fengdiyong in November; Ren Cheng in December; and Sheng Dayongji and Yuandayong in this month.</p>
<p>(3) For March A. In the financial industry: (1) The Central Savings Association officially announced its opening on the 16th. The association was established with funds allocated by the Central Trust Bureau, with a capital of 5 million yuan, and appointed Mr. Li Shuming as the manager. It specializes in prize savings. All depositors of the former Sino-French Savings Association were taken over by the association. (2) The Bank Acceptance House was also established on the 16th. The House was established by the Shanghai Banking Association and based on the resolution of the Shanghai Joint Reserve Committee's Bank Representatives Congress. It specializes in acceptance business between colleagues in the industry. The manager is Mr. Zhu Boquan. 38 banks have joined, and the acceptance fund is 7,623,750 yuan. This is a new development in the cooperation between banks. B. In public utilities: The Pudong Electric Company decided at its annual shareholders' meeting to increase its capital by another 500,000 yuan. The International Telecommunications Bureau was abolished by order of the Ministry of Communications. These are the two major changes in the city's public utilities. C. In the industrial sector: (1) The Guangdong Brothers Rubber Company announced its closure in mid-December last year due to the impact of the sharp drop in prices. In recent months, due to excessive debt, it has been unable to resume operations. This time, the creditors decided to jointly maintain the resumption of operations and formed a maintenance business committee to manage production. The company's head office is located in Hong Kong, and the Shanghai branch was founded in 1927. It employs more than 360 workers and can produce 10,000 dozen rubber shoes per day. The impact on the rubber industry is significant. (2) The closure of the Yangzi Flour Company is also a loss to the flour industry. Although the company's factory is located in Xiaguan, Nanjing, it has a general office in Shanghai. The capital is 300,000 yuan, and the maximum daily flour production is 10,000 bags. D. In the sales industry, in addition to the aforementioned new department stores, the establishment of two joint sales offices this month is also noteworthy: one is the opening of the China Machine-made Stone Powder Joint Sales Office, and the other is the establishment of the Xing'an Sugarcane Sales Office. The China Machine-made Stone Powder Joint Sales Office is jointly established by the Shanghai members of the China Machine-made Stone Powder Factory Association, Shunchang, Ruitai, Zhenxin, China, and the Wuxi members Chengtai, Chengda, Yongli, and other machine-made stone powder factories for the purpose of selling the products of each factory. The Xing'an Sugarcane Sales Office is composed of 16 sugar merchants, Zhicheng, Jichun, Fanglai, Jiechun, Fuyu, Tianxiang, Heshen, Defeng, Zhenxing, Wanhe, Zhaotai, Tongchang, Sanchun, Wanchun, Fucheng, and Taiyuan, for the purpose of promoting Fujian sugarcane. In recent years, the trend of production and sales cooperation in China's industry and commerce has become increasingly common, which is also a welcome phenomenon. (End)</p>

<p>This year's Davis Cup, the United States has already lost to Australia in the American Zone final, so there is no opportunity to meet the defending champion, Britain. After the United States lost to Australia, public opinion criticized the US for still using the veteran Allison for singles, instead of the young player Grant, considering it a strategic mistake. Now, British and American players have launched a Davis Cup trial match to test the strength of the two countries. The United States replaced Allison with Grant for singles. Although the outcome is not important, it is a very interesting international friendship competition.</p>

<h3 id="e189">All Provinces and Cities to Double Fundraising for Compulsory Education Funds This Year; Ministry of Education Has Drafted Measures, Central Government to Discuss Immediately <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The total amount of central government subsidies for education funds in various provinces and cities for the 25th year is 4.6 million yuan, an increase of 1.4 million yuan compared to the previous year (the central government subsidy for the previous year was 2.4 million yuan, plus 300,000 yuan for border education and 530,000 yuan, totaling 3.2 million yuan). This has been published in this newspaper. It is understood that the funds required for various provinces, cities, and districts to implement compulsory education are, except for remote provinces and impoverished provinces and regions that may receive special subsidies from the central government, based on Article 6 of the "Outline of Measures for Implementing Compulsory Education" promulgated and implemented by the central government, "The funding for compulsory education should be borne by the local governments in principle, but for remote, impoverished provinces and cities and other provinces and cities with special circumstances, the central government may provide appropriate subsidies." and Article 23 of the "Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Outline of Measures for Implementing Compulsory Education", "The funding for compulsory education shall be unified by the government in urban areas, and in the counties and cities of the provinces, it shall be borne by the province and county in proportion. The central government may also subsidize the provinces and cities according to the circumstances." It is therefore the principle that each province and city should raise as much as possible on its own. Now that the central government has increased the subsidy for compulsory education funds for various provinces and cities by 1.4 million yuan compared to the previous year, in order to actively promote compulsory education and meet the urgent needs in reality, it is also required that each province and city raise its own funds for compulsory education, doubling the amount raised in the 24th year. The standards and methods for this increased fundraising by various provinces and cities in the 25th year have been drafted by the Ministry of Education and submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. It is said that the central government meeting will be held soon to approve and promulgate it.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Li Jinxi Arrives in Beijing to Discuss Phonetic Chinese Characters; Beneficial for Preventing Cheating <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Li Jinxi, Dean of the College of Liberal Arts at the National Peiping Normal University, arrived in Beijing at the end of last month from the north to broadcast "Phonetic Symbols and Simplified Characters" and to discuss official business with the Ministry of Education. According to reports, the progress, advantages, and disadvantages of promoting phonetic Chinese characters, and the suspension of simplified characters, are as follows:</p>
<p>Phonetic Chinese Characters Are Being Promoted</p>
<p>The government spent a huge amount of money to promote short-term compulsory education last year, and this year it has increased it to more than 4 million yuan. At the same time, it is promoting civil education, with more than one million yuan in funding. This type of education must be widespread and have practical effects. The key point is still the improvement of language tools. Phonetic Chinese characters are used to assist the public in literacy with the help of phonetic symbols. The purpose is not to unify the country. The Ministry of Education allocated 20,000 yuan last year to cast bronze molds of phonetic Chinese characters. Each set has four sizes: two, three, four, and five. Each set has more than 5,000 to 7,000 characters. It is stipulated that from July 1st of this year, all textbooks and supplementary reading materials for primary schools and civil schools must be printed with phonetic Chinese characters, otherwise they will not be approved or will be punished. According to a survey by the National Language Promotion Committee, these textbooks have been widely used in the past six months. However, there is a lack of teachers, which often makes the phonetic symbols next to the characters equivalent to double dumbness. Therefore, I came to Beijing this time to propose to the ministry based on the resolutions of the National Language Conference to focus on teachers, avoid perfunctory work, and seek simplification and universalization in the transmission of phonetic symbols. The bronze molds cast by the Ministry, sizes two and three, have been delivered by the Zhonghua Book Company, and sizes four and five will be completed soon. The Sai bronze molds cast by the Commercial Press have already produced phonetic size three characters, which are also beautiful and very cheap.</p>
<p>Phonetic Chinese Characters are Beneficial and Have No Drawbacks</p>
<p>People in the education field are concerned about the disadvantages of paying attention to Chinese characters: (1) Replacing characters with sounds is overwhelming. They do not know that Chinese characters are necessary for the living environment, and there is no one who only reads the phonetic symbols next to them. Those who already know how to read characters can focus on reading Chinese characters, regardless of the phonetic symbols on the right. If they encounter a new character, they can know the meaning from the sound by looking at the phonetic symbols. If they know very few characters, the right side is the "teacher," and they can learn characters from the sound. If they do not know any characters at all, they can understand the meaning by temporarily spelling out the sounds. Like this, the guest and host complement each other, so how can it be overwhelming? (2) Text printing is more troublesome. They do not know that the movable type of phonetic Chinese characters has the phonetic symbols fixed on the right side of the Chinese characters. With this printing tool, those who write the text do not have to add phonetic symbols, and they can be sent to print. Typesetters do not have to typeset phonetic symbols, which is a win-win situation. Proofreaders do not have to look at the phonetic symbols, and there will be no errors. After the book is completed, it is clear and beautiful. However, those who learn phonetic symbols can all read. (3) The size of the phonetic symbols harms eyesight. They do not know that all new reading materials for children and the public currently use size four Chinese characters, and no one uses size five. Textbooks use even larger characters, size two and above. The fixed phonetic symbols on the right are not small in shape, the strokes are simple, and they are a reference, not the main reading. How can it harm eyesight? (4) The printing is flashy and dazzling. This is because intellectuals who already know many characters do not realize it and criticize it casually. They have not thought about it for children and the illiterate public who are learning to read. It is not worth arguing. (5) Preparing but not using them results in redundancy. This should only focus on teachers and not throw the baby out with the bathwater. My coming here is to remedy this shortcoming.</p>
<p>Simplified Characters are Still Used Freely</p>
<p>The list of simplified characters was announced by the Ministry of Education in August of the Earth year (likely referring to a year in the Chinese sexagenary cycle). It contains 324 characters, most of which are already commonly used in society. Originally, they could have been implemented automatically without promotion. In January of this year, the Executive Yuan ordered "postponing implementation." Those who misunderstand this think that this is a prohibition on using simplified characters. They do not know that the Yuan order is to delay the nine articles of the "Measures for Promoting Simplified Characters Promulgated by the Ministry of Education by Educational Administrative Organs in Various Provinces and Cities," not to cancel the announced list of simplified characters. In the future, if textbooks and other materials want to use simplified characters, they can still use them freely. Junior high schools are all subject to review and approval, and the general public can still write simplified characters. Who will interfere? The announcement of the list of simplified characters is only to indicate "review completed" and "recognition." In addition to this first batch, a full spectrum should be created for use in primary schools and civil schools to learn to write characters. Because simplified characters are only for convenient writing and have nothing to do with reading, while phonetic Chinese characters are only for convenient reading and have nothing to do with writing. It is said that Mr. Li will take a ship to Hunan as soon as he finishes his official business with the Ministry of Education.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Modification Points of the Teacher Training Curriculum Standards; Elementary Teacher and Rural Teacher and Kindergarten Teacher <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The National Compilation and Translation Bureau previously presented to the Ministry of Education, stating that several sections in the current curriculum standards for elementary normal schools and elementary rural normal schools should be slightly modified: (1) Civic Moral Life, (1) (10) "Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Psychological Construction Theory" should be moved back and changed to Civic Political Life, (3) (4) because it is the basic condition for revolutionary construction. (2) Civic Moral Life (3) (3) In "The National Intrinsic Advantages and Research," the words "and Research" should be deleted, because the existence of these three characters is not only meaningless but also confusing. (3) General Principles of Law, (2) Under "Subject and Object of Rights," there were originally three sections: one is the meaning of rights, the second is the types of rights, and the third is natural persons and legal persons. According to the "natural persons and legal persons" are the subjects of rights, which has been listed as a detail, the object of rights should also be listed as a detail. It is proposed to change it as follows: (2) Subject and Object of Rights, (1) The meaning and types of rights, (2) Natural persons and legal persons, (3) Things, (4) Civic Economic Life, (5) Under "Distribution," there were originally four sections, but the item of land rent is missing. It is proposed to add the three characters "Land Rent and" to "Wages." In addition, the law of the civic curriculum standard for the two-year kindergarten teacher training course, (4) the section on "Ownership of Real Estate" should be deleted, because the section on ownership before it did not specify that it only talked about movable property. Recently, the Ministry of Education issued an instruction that the above-mentioned sections should be approved for modification.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order yesterday to public and private primary and secondary schools, stating that it has been ordered by the Bureau's No. 4493 order that students should not be charged extra graduation fees upon graduation. Now it is found that when new students enroll, some schools collect security deposits, and some collect compensation for damage fees. When students graduate, the security deposits that should be refunded are not refunded. Students have not damaged school property, and the compensation for damage fees collected is also not refunded, which is very inappropriate. In addition to sending staff to investigate separately, fees that should be refunded to students in the future must be refunded in full. Otherwise, they will be severely punished. All schools must comply with this order.</p>

<p>Yesterday, when the American cotton market opened, the prices of each month rose and fell by one to two pounds of sound. It was tired at first due to the long side closing out and foreign merchants selling, and then recovered due to the purchase of the same industry and brokers. The market price did not fluctuate much. Tennessee and Georgia had beneficial rain, and Alabama had light rain. As a result, manufacturers were unwilling to buy, but the South Texas had too much rain, so the market was not affected. The actual location is higher, and the same industry seems to be waiting and watching. Before the closing, cotton farmers hedged and the long side closed out, and the market turned tired.

<p>In the past two weeks, the yarn and cotton market has suddenly soared. The market is hot and has reached a boiling point. First of all, the market spread rumors about the issuance of circulating notes, and flour and wheat rose wildly. Securities firms and financial circles rushed to the market to buy, and the amount accumulated more and more. However, in view of the domestic demand downturn and the high prices, the general industry unanimously tended to sell. At the end of June and the beginning of July, there was a period of fierce competition between the long and short sides, and the prices fluctuated constantly. Later, after the US cotton government's field estimate was released on July 8, the area was 30,621,000 acres, which was lower than the same period last year. Therefore, after the estimate was released, the price of New York cotton rebounded by 60 pounds of sound. At this point, the long side received the support of the world cotton market, and the enthusiasm was extremely strong. At the opening of the first session on July 9, the price of yarn jumped by 3 yuan, and the price of cotton jumped by 6, 7, and 8 cents. Securities firms and financial circles worked hard to buy, and the long side was elated. As for the selling side, seeing the other side's surging attack, they had to endure the pain and cover their positions. As a result, the long and short sides advanced side by side, and for a time, the chips were not enough to turn around, and they raised prices against each other, shouting higher and higher. On the 10th, the price of yarn continued to rise by 3 yuan. The old cotton in July and August also had a long-term company organization. The long side previously purchased 70,000 dan of coarse cotton that had been purchased successively, valued at 45 yuan and a half, and sold it to a merchant to be loaded and shipped overseas for sale in preparation for squeezing, etc. As soon as the news spread, the market situation changed rapidly, and buyers rushed in like a tide. The price of July and August rose by 1 yuan and 90 cents to 2 yuan a day. The price of new cotton rose accordingly. On the 11th, the price of yarn jumped again by 4 yuan. The price of December peaked at 219 yuan and 80 cents, which was 6 yuan and 70 cents higher than the price of 213 yuan and 10 cents on April 14 this year. The price of old cotton in July and August rose again by 1 yuan, 70 cents, and 80 cents. The highest peak was 50 yuan and 30 cents a half, which was 3 yuan and 60 cents a half higher than the price of 46 yuan and a half on April 14, sweeping away the weak and sluggish market situation in the past six years. The highest peak in the past five years was discovered. It was found that the total amount of yarn in storage had increased sharply to 793,000 bales. The amount of yarn in storage of Tongji, Chengji, Yuda, Mingde, Hexing, Fengtai, and Dachangcheng were all over 10,000 bales to 22,000 bales.

The chips of Deda, Chengji, Jinchang, Mingde, Hexing, Fengtai, Dachangcheng, Changfeng, Run Kang, and Jinkang increased greatly from 15,000 to 60,000 or 70,000 dan, setting an unprecedented record in the history of the exchange. In view of the dangerous situation, the authorities increased the special margin for cotton yarn by 8 yuan per bale for the sake of stability, totaling 16 yuan before. The margin for cotton was increased by 3 yuan per dan, totaling 6 yuan before. However, the old cotton in July and August still rose and fell, and the margin was increased by 3 yuan per dan from the 14th (a total of 12 yuan per dan including the previous one for July), (a total of 9 yuan per dan including the previous one for August). Then, in the past two days, the market situation has gradually stabilized, probably because the drought-stricken areas of American cotton have received rain, southern cotton farmers have hedged, and the long side has closed out. The market price has fallen back by more than 20 pounds of sound in the past two days. Therefore, the long side is not as aggressive as before. At the same time, the actual demand for cotton yarn is not strong, and the sales in foreign countries are not good. The daily turnover is only between 400, 500, and 600 bales, which is inevitably unsatisfactory. In addition, the military disturbances in the two Guang provinces and the occupation of the north by Japanese yarn have narrowed the sales area of this yarn day by day. The yarn stockpiled in the yarn and cloth warehouses has been accumulating day by day, increasing step by step, and has reached as high as 33,000 bales. The price comparison of spot yarn and cotton and overseas market prices in the past two weeks is listed on the left. The cotton price is the price of this month, the yarn price is the far-term price of December, the remaining three grades of yarn and cotton are the prices of this month, the Indian cotton price is the price of July and August, and the prices of Blue Phoenix yarn, Double Horse, and Human Bell are all spot market prices.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the price of cotton cloth rose in the morning and fell back in the afternoon, because the price of yarn and cotton rose in the morning and fell back in the afternoon. The market became firm and then relaxed. Although the factory price was still firm, the stockpiled goods on the market were unsettled due to the lack of actual transactions, and they fluctuated with the market. The price of Dong goods and white goods in the market only rose and fell by 2.5 to 5 cents. The prices of fancy goods such as Four Gentlemen drill, straight tribute, and Xuxian Village tribute satin only fell by 1.25 to 2.5 cents per yard. The selling price of fancy goods from this factory remained the same. Occasionally, small amounts of white goods were sold out, which was a small number of points to one dime higher than the market price. There were few transactions on this street. The Kunming market in Yunnan was not selling well, so the market could not be expected to pick up, and the demand was greatly reduced. The finances of the Guangdong gang were originally depressed, and now the market is even more depressed due to the overall situation. The demand from the Yangtze River region of Anhui and Jiangxi has gradually become stagnant. The Qingdao, Tianjin, and Yantai roads in the north are all deserted. However, the Jinan gang has continuously purchased more than 300 registered printed floral tributes, drills, and other printed fabrics. The Sichuan gang has purchased more than 200 pieces of American Hengqingfeng factory's large crepe de chine, straight tribute, drill, and Lunchang factory's printed drill straight tribute and color tribute. The orders for colored cloths are also being reported and packed frequently. The wholesale stores on this street have purchased more than 100 pieces of various factory's floral cloths, printed drill straight tribute, thread, bleached flannel, and striped bleached cloths. The retail business is usually slow, and the continuous rainy days have made it even more deserted.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the futures wheat market, after the opening in the morning, the market of each month showed a phenomenon of initially being flat and then rising sharply. The prices of foreign wheat were quoted, and the prices of Chicago's July and September continued to be good by 3, 4, and 10 cents, and the price of December was good by 40 cents. The transactions were not smooth when the price was quoted, but the price was shouted up by 3 and 5 cents. Then, the transactions turned smooth, and the prices of foreign wheat have been rising for several days, so people in the industry could not help but be attracted. Therefore, the price was raised by another 30 and 40 cents. The transactions were still lively at the opening in the afternoon, and the market had already circled. Since the price had risen enough in the morning, it seemed difficult to rise again. In the end, according to the market value of new wheat, this year is already unprecedented. If there are no unexpected disturbances, it should not be over-raised. The spot wheat market was still stable, and the transactions were very smooth. The opening price of Huaian wheat was 4 yuan, 40 cents, and 7 cents, the opening price of Bengbu wheat was 4 yuan, 50 cents, and 1 cent, the opening price of Liuhe wheat was 4 yuan, 30 cents, and 7 cents, the opening price of Nanjing wheat was 4 yuan, 30 cents, and 3 cents, the opening price of Jiangbei wheat was 4 yuan, 40 cents, and 1 cent, the opening price of Wuhu wheat was 4 yuan, 30 cents, and 3 cents, the opening price of Daqiao wheat was 4 yuan, 40 cents, and 50 cents, the opening price of Qingjiang wheat was 4 yuan, 40 cents, and 8 cents, and the second price was 40 cents and 1 cent, the opening price of Gaoyou wheat was 4 yuan, 40 cents, and 6 cents, the opening price of Jiangxi wheat was 4 yuan, 30 cents, and 50 cents, the opening price of Zhumadian wheat was 4 yuan, 50 cents, and 1 cent, the opening price of Niaoyi wheat was 4 yuan, 40 cents, and 6 cents, the opening price of Hankou wheat was 4 yuan and 30 cents, and the second price was 20 cents, and the price of boat wheat such as Zhitang wheat was 4 yuan and 10 cents and 8 cents, the price of Kunshan wheat was 4 yuan and 10 cents and 4 cents, the price of Penglai wheat was 4 yuan and 8 cents, the price of Anting wheat was 4 yuan and 10 cents, the price of Pudong wheat was 3 yuan and 90 cents and 50 cents, the price of Taicang wheat was 4 yuan and 10 cents and 3 cents, Fuxin handled 20,000 bags, and Shenda handled 2,000 bags, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the market of each month was still peaceful. As for the price limit issue, it has not yet been cancelled. Generally speaking, the market is unpredictable, and it is difficult to suppress it. From the perspective of both sides, it is of course not easy to level the price, and the interests are different. In the future, it must be more realistic to be closer to the facts. It is said that it may be implemented tomorrow, or the price limit may be changed, and everything is in doubt. As for the underground market, which is not open to the public, the hearts of</p>

<p>It is expected that the price of ke xian rice will rebound due to the continuous rain. The trading is also active. Because of the rain in the past few days, people have a positive outlook. Yesterday, mainland brokers were very active and purchased more than 4,000 bags of medium and low-grade rice from various routes throughout the day. The local market has also become active again. Furthermore, Ningbo and Beiyang brokers have also made some contributions. Both local and out-of-town buyers are active, and the market has immediately improved. The prices of high-grade rice have rebounded slightly. If the weather remains cloudy, the market may need to be built up step by step. Yesterday, 5,300 bags of early and late rice from Jiangxi were sold, along with 548 bags of coarse and broken rice, 1,200 bags of Hunan rice, 300 bags of Anqing rice, 166 bags of Shaoxing rice, and 500 bags of sandy coarse rice.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the supply from various out-of-town brokers only reached the 13th and 14th of the month, totaling over 3,000 shi (a unit of dry measure). However, sales in this area remained sluggish, with only 600 bags purchased by Qingdao and Qinhuangdao brokers. Therefore, the market conditions are difficult to improve. The prices of thick early japonica rice and thin indica rice, except for the high-quality grades which remained stable, continued to decline by a few points for medium-quality rice. The sales of "Du Yang Jian" rice were slow, and the price was lowered by nearly a chi (a unit of length). The price of "Yin Bian Yuan" rice was average.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, the supply from various places downstream reached the 15th and 16th of the month. Although the weather was intermittently cloudy and sunny, the market sales were still relatively active. The price of fresh white japonica rice increased by four to five points. The price of "Bai Yuan" rice remained stable. The price of fresh thin indica rice increased by a few points. The prices of "Yang Du Bu" and ke xian rice decreased due to the decline in the price of Jiangxi Jian rice, causing the market price to follow suit. The prices of other goods remained largely unchanged compared to the previous day.</p>

<p>Recently, although the supply of new soybeans has been increasing, the price was high when the market first opened due to the scarcity of goods, causing out-of-town brokers to hesitate. Sales have been slow, with only sporadic local sales. Therefore, the market price has frequently declined. Yesterday, the market continued to decline by one or two jiao (a unit of currency). 175 bags of new soybeans from Jiujiang Chengmen were sold at a price of 5.84 to 5.88 yuan. 50 bags of new white soybeans from Hankou June were sold at a price of 6 yuan.</p>

<p>Recently, overseas sales have been sluggish, and the market has gradually become weak. The silk market in Shanghai has also become stagnant. Yesterday, the spot price in New York continued to decline by one point, while the futures price rebounded slightly by half a point. The spot price in Yokohama rose by eight yuan, and the futures price rose by ten yuan. The price of Shanghai silk A-grade in Lyon rose by half a franc. The transactions of other goods were scarce, and prices remained unchanged. Silk transactions in this city have also become quiet.</p>

Yesterday, 60 more boxes of No. 120 "Tianqiao" brand from the Japanese merchant Abeshio Yoko were purchased at a price of 126 to 128 yuan per box. In addition, 10 boxes of "Tianqiao" brand cleared through customs in this city were purchased at a price of 418 yuan per box. The remaining stock of "Taiyo Bijin" brand will be inventoried at a price of 408 yuan. Several boxes were sold. Yesterday, a major local company sold more than 10 boxes of No. 75 "Simini Ai" shiny No. 3 at a price of 478 yuan per box. The prices of Japanese goods have been rising continuously. Yesterday, the price of No. 120 "Daqiao" brand was about 130 yuan in Chinese currency per box.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the tea market was slightly sluggish. The market for Keemun and Ningzhou black tea has become quiet. Both British and Russian companies have reduced purchases recently due to falling tea prices and having already purchased sufficient quantities. They will not increase purchases unless they receive further instructions from overseas. The market for green tea is also slightly weaker than before. Yesterday, only Xiehe, Tianyu, Baochang and other firms purchased a total of more than 600 boxes of "Zhenmei" and "Zhenmei" needle tea at prices ranging from 1-2 yuan to 4-5 yuan lower.</p>
<p>According to the Tea Trade Association's report, the sales of Zhenmei tea from various regions remained quiet yesterday. The reason is that the inventory of each tea firm is not large, and the quality of good tea is even less. However, the selling price is still difficult to reduce, so the prices offered by various firms do not match the prices desired by overseas buyers. Therefore, no offers were sent overseas, and the market has stagnated. Small boxes of Ping-Shui tea have been traded since last week, and transactions continued yesterday. Only Yu Long sold large boxes of tea from Class B to Jin Long. The market is considered active. The trade of dyed pearl tea is sporadic, but the market price is stable due to the small inventory.</p>

<p>Since the new XuZhou daylily crop came out, more than 700 packages have been shipped here, and Da Cheng company handled the most, accounting for about 70%. Also the goods are of the highest quality, so people buying XuZhou products are focused on Da Cheng products. The harvest price has dropped nearly a yuan in recent days, but news has just come that the supply is tight, and the sales here are pretty good. Yesterday miscellaneous XuZhou vegetables opened slightly lower.  There wasn't much movement in the business. Prices may fall a little today. The company heard from XuZhou that they were continuing to buy Da Cheng products. The reported harvest price dropped by two jiao.  If too much is purchased, it may rise again.</p>
<p>The company set up by Gongyu Jincai has 20 shareholders, with 75 shares, with a total capital of 75,000 yuan in national currency. The office is located in the Ruida Company on Yangxing Street. Yesterday, Ruihe opened 8 packages of Huang Kou vegetables at 18.5 yuan. Zhengxiang opened 18 packages of XuZhou vegetables at 19 yuan. Dingsheng dumped 45 packages at 19 yuan. I heard that the first batch of Da Xing vegetables has arrived in Zhenjiang with 72 packages. Tomorrow, 24 packages can be shipped to Shanghai. The opening price in Zhenjiang is about 20 yuan, but it has not been determined yet.</p>

<p>Regarding Tianjin red dates, a letter was received from the production area stating that the production price has suddenly increased by one or two yuan due to the Guangdong brokers directly purchasing more than 1,000 packages. The inventory in Tianjin is also not large, with a total of only a little more than 1,000 packages. The inventory of each firm here is less than 1,000 packages, but because sales are slow, the market price has increased by about half a yuan. Yesterday, top-quality Beichen red dates were sold for 17-18 yuan, first-grade red dates were sold for 13-14 yuan, second-grade red dates were sold for 12 yuan, top-quality Leling red dates were sold for 15-16 yuan, first-grade red dates were sold for 12-13 yuan, second-grade red dates were sold for 11 yuan, and regular red dates were sold for 8.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Recently, sales of sunflower seeds have been sluggish in all regions, and the Tianjin market has declined. It is said that some Tianjin merchants have suffered too much loss and cannot maintain their businesses. The current production price ranges from 9 yuan to 5.4 yuan. The market price here is 12-13 yuan for high-quality goods, 10.5 yuan for medium-quality goods, and 8.5-8.6 yuan for small-sized goods. The market may continue to decline.</p>

<p>Yesterday in the sugar market, the trend of Hehe coarse white and other sugars was still flat and soft. Domestic brown sugar was firm beyond Heng. The association set the price of No. 24 coarse white spot at 22 yuan, and the price of re-exported goods was called 6.8 yuan, down another five points. The spot and re-exported prices of Dongbai No. 4, 8, and 9 were all called at the original price. Taigu che white opened for more than 1,000 packages to be loaded immediately at a price of 2.35 Dutch guilders. Long-term Hehe coarse white was indeed opened at 2.95 Dutch guilders, but it was not successful at yesterday's original price. Guangchao brokers opened 61 packages of Duanji red sugar at 14.5 yuan, up three jiao, and continued to open 600 packages of Hainan red sugar at 12.3 yuan. The market price of Diaoqing sugar also tightened slightly.</p>
<p>The joint venture company held its third weekly auction of Guangdong sugar yesterday. The total quota was more than 7,000 packages. The bid price was the same as before, but the price of second-quality goods was reduced. 230 packages of Dongguan Factory oil-wrapped coarse white sugar were sold for 21.3 yuan, 0.4 jiao lower than good-quality goods. 744 packages of Shantou second-quality coarse white sugar were sold for 20.7 yuan. 160 packages of medium white granulated sugar were sold for 19.3 yuan.

Due to transportation difficulties, large-volume transactions did not occur. The Yuan Chun company sold four to five hundred barrels of nails from this factory, which were purchased by Sichuan brokers. The price remained unchanged. Hongkou brokers distributed a lot of English steel plates, new foreign dollars, I-beams, and new lead wire, but the number was small, and there was no change in the market. The quiet scene of the blue lead market seems to have passed. Printing houses, type foundries, paint companies, and shipyards have become active in purchasing, and the price is much firmer than before, opening at 22.5 yuan per dan (a unit of weight). The price of Hunan lead also needs to be opened at 21.25 yuan. There were few offers for white lead sheet, blue lead iron, black iron sheet, Yuan silk, angle iron, and steel bars, so the market was relatively sluggish.</p>

<p>— 顧文淑</p>
<p>— Gu Wenshu</p>
<p>自從馳明的盧梭，發明了人類是一概平等的話；便引起了世界上莫大的騷動；好像帝制的被打倒，和民主的勃興等，但是除了這些外，還有一件也是被這學說所推動而發生的事，就是十九世紀以來的女權運動，全世界的婦女都在走上或預備走上解放的道路，希望不論在政治上，社會上，經濟上，要和男子受同等待遇，不過假使我們用顯微鏡的目光細察起來，我們就可以威覺到目前世界上，不論那一個女權最發達的國家，他國裏的婦女，還可以說沒有達到眞正的平等，那麼什麼纔是眞正的平等呢？下面一封信，可以指示我們眞正平等的方向，這封信是一個法國女子（Madame　Sante）寫給巴黎晚報（Paris—Soir）的，我現在把這對信翻在下面，貢獻給讀者們。</p>
<p>Since the renowned Rousseau invented the idea that all human beings are equal, it has caused great turmoil in the world, such as the overthrow of the imperial system and the rise of democracy. But besides these, there is another thing that has been promoted by this theory, that is, the feminist movement since the nineteenth century. Women all over the world are embarking on or preparing to embark on the road to liberation, hoping to receive the same treatment as men in politics, society, and economy. However, if we examine it carefully with a microscopic eye, we can feel that in the current world, no matter which country has the most developed women's rights, the women in that country can still be said to have not achieved true equality. So what is true equality? The following letter can point us in the direction of true equality. This letter was written by a French woman (Madame Sante) to the Paris evening newspaper (Paris—Soir). I will now translate this pair of letters below and contribute them to readers.</p>
<p>前天早晨，我（Sante自稱）出去買些雜物，因為我是個平常的主婦，在路上有一張佈告，吸引我的注意力。</p>
<p>The day before yesterday morning, I (Sante said myself) went out to buy some groceries, because I am an ordinary housewife, and on the road there was a notice that attracted my attention.</p>
<p>今日國家婦女連合會，開會討論反對戰爭與法西斯。</p>
<p>Today, the National Women's Federation will hold a meeting to discuss opposition to war and fascism.</p>
<p>我看了後，認為很不錯，我們女人不能讓男子們去胡作非為，我們也要出主意；我們須要不論在社會上，經濟上，政治上，宗教上，和他們平等，我們須要享有工作不受限制的權利，和男子同等的薪金，完全的選舉權和被選舉權等，後來我轉念一想，我們單是和男子爭和自己有利的權利，而對於和自己無利的權利像服兵等苦役，置之不聞不問，我想這種片面的，不完整的平等，決定不是天賦我（第二十六期）們的平等吧！</p>
<p>After reading it, I thought it was very good. We women cannot let men act recklessly. We must also come up with ideas. We must be equal to them in society, economy, politics, and religion. We must have the right to work without restrictions, the same salary as men, full voting rights and the right to be elected, etc. Later, I changed my mind and thought that we are only fighting with men for rights that are beneficial to ourselves, but for rights that are not beneficial to ourselves, such as military service and other hard labor, we turn a blind eye. I think this kind of one-sided, incomplete equality is definitely not the equality that God has given us (issue 26)!</p>
<p>全國的女同胞們，看了這封信，我們應當明白怎樣去找這神聖的眞平等了。</p>
<p>Female compatriots across the country, after reading this letter, we should understand how to find this sacred true equality.</p>

<h3 id="e239">New Reforms in Soviet Marriage Law <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 魯沙白女士</p>
<p>— Ms. Lusha Bai</p>
<p>蘇聯的婚姻法原來是根據自由結婚法草成的，一面祗要男女兩性合意，便可以結婚，不受任何束縛。兩人中有一人要離婚，也祗須依法請求完成一個極簡單的手續，就可仳離。這是蘇聯自由結婚的根本精神，一向很受對蘇聯表示好感的各國的稱讚。但實際上運用起來，却不免有很多人利用離婚手續的簡單，使蘇聯的性道德陷於墮落。譬如家庭的破裂和兒童的棄置等事，隨處都可看見，這對於趨向社會主義建設的蘇聯社會，確是一大缺點。</p>
<p>The Soviet marriage law was originally drafted based on the Free Marriage Law. As long as both men and women agree, they can get married without any restrictions. If one of the two wants a divorce, they only need to apply in accordance with the law and complete a very simple procedure to divorce. This is the fundamental spirit of Soviet free marriage, which has always been praised by countries that express goodwill towards the Soviet Union. However, in practice, many people inevitably take advantage of the simplicity of the divorce procedures to make Soviet sexual morality fall into depravity. For example, the breakdown of families and the abandonment of children can be seen everywhere. This is indeed a major shortcoming for Soviet society, which is moving towards socialist construction.</p>
<p>蘇聯當局對這事實，極為重視，便積極進行改革結婚法；今年五月二十六日，便將改革的方案，交各官廳，工塲，農塲上作普遍的討論，微求大衆的意見。這次結婚法改革的內容相當廣泛，它的根本原則仍是以自由結婚法為基礎，但特別重視父母的義務，同時更注重家庭的意義。</p>
<p>The Soviet authorities attach great importance to this fact and actively carry out reforms in the marriage law. On May 26 of this year, the reform plan was submitted to government offices, factories, and farms for general discussion, seeking the opinions of the public. The content of this marriage law reform is quite extensive. Its fundamental principle is still based on the Free Marriage Law, but it pays special attention to the obligations of parents and at the same time pays more attention to the meaning of family.</p>
<p>改革後的婚姻法，第一是離婚較前困難；從來離婚登記費要繳五盧布，現在增加為第一次離婚繳五十盧布，第二次離婚繳一百五十盧布，第三次離婚繳三百盧布。離婚時倘有子女，應歸母親扶養，但由父親支出月薪的三分之一供給母親作兒童的撫養費，倘不履行道條約，卽判處兩年的徒刑。</p>
<p>The first reform of the marriage law is that divorce is more difficult than before. In the past, the divorce registration fee was five rubles, but now it has been increased to fifty rubles for the first divorce, one hundred and fifty rubles for the second divorce, and three hundred rubles for the third divorce. If there are children at the time of divorce, they should be raised by the mother, but the father should pay one-third of his monthly salary to the mother as child support. If the treaty is not fulfilled, he will be sentenced to two years in prison.</p>
<p>男子負有支付撫養費的義務時，他的護照上卽有詳細的記載，無論他在蘇聯邦任何地方工作，都經常由月薪中扣除，不得拖欠。至於離婚的手續，也仍只要一方的意志卽可成立，離婚通知書也只須用掛號寄去卽可。這仍舊保存昔日自由結婚的精神，但不過加重了離婚前後的經濟負担，對那般隨意離合的男女加以限制而巳。</p>
<p>When a man has the obligation to pay child support, his passport will have detailed records. No matter where he works in the Soviet Union, it will be regularly deducted from his monthly salary and cannot be in arrears. As for the divorce procedures, it can still be established as long as one party wills it, and the divorce notice only needs to be sent by registered mail. This still preserves the spirit of free marriage in the past, but it only increases the economic burden before and after divorce, and restricts those men and women who divorce at will.</p>
<p>據這次的改革看來，似乎特別限制男子，但對女子方面也有相當的限制。有子女的母親應負擔撫育子女的責任，倘不履行這種義務，父親有提起告訴之權：：所以這决的改革並不偏於任何一方，而是專重雙方為父母的責任的。</p>
<p>According to this reform, it seems to particularly restrict men, but there are also considerable restrictions on women. Mothers with children should bear the responsibility of raising their children. If they do not fulfill this obligation, the father has the right to file a lawsuit. Therefore, this reform does not favor either party, but focuses on the responsibility of both parties as parents.</p>
<p>改革的第二點是獎勵生育，有七個子女的父母，生到第八個後，從第一年到第五年，每年由政府津貼二千盧布：生到十一個以後，第一年給以五千盧布，第二年以後到第四年，每年給以三千盧布。蘇聯的這種積極獎勵生育，正是因為它的產業建設發展，一切需要着新的勞力，同時為了建設新的社會文化生活，所以政府對於多產多育者不能不予以經濟上的援助。</p>
<p>The second point of the reform is to encourage childbirth. Parents with seven children will receive a government subsidy of 2,000 rubles per year from the first to the fifth year after the birth of the eighth child. After the birth of the eleventh child, they will receive 5,000 rubles in the first year and 3,000 rubles per year from the second to the fourth year. The Soviet Union's active encouragement of childbirth is precisely because its industrial construction is developing and everything requires new labor. At the same time, in order to build a new social and cultural life, the government has to provide economic assistance to those who have many children.</p>
<p>改革的第三點是對妊婦的保護，禁止各地工廠藉故將妊婦停職或拒絕收用，違者嚴重處罰。在以前的結婚法中，本來也有這條規定，但這次改革後，對於任婦的保護更為周密，而對於上述將妊婦停職或拒絕收用妊婦者處罰，也較前更為嚴峻。</p>
<p>The third point of the reform is the protection of pregnant women. It is forbidden for factories in various places to suspend or refuse to hire pregnant women on the grounds of excuse. Violators will be severely punished. This provision was originally included in the previous marriage law, but after this reform, the protection of pregnant women is more comprehensive, and the penalties for suspending or refusing to hire pregnant women are more severe than before.</p>
<p>最後是關於墮胎問題，在革命後的混亂期間，因為男女都從事於社會工作，對於限制生育以至墮胎等，在那時只要當事人願意，卽可隨便實行。但因此也發生性道德的腐化，引起重大的社會缺憾。</p>
<p>Finally, there is the issue of abortion. During the chaos after the revolution, because both men and women were engaged in social work, limiting childbirth and even abortion could be carried out casually as long as the parties involved were willing. However, this also led to the corruption of sexual morality, causing major social regrets.</p>
<p>現在蘇聯的國民生活，巳趨安定，像墮胎這非法的手段早巳沒有必要，所以這次修改結婚法，便禁止一切危害母親身體的非法生產；違此禁例，卽處一年到三年的徒刑。但經醫生認為有墮胎的必要時，則不在禁止之列。同時並指定墮胎的孕婦，須在有最優良設備的國立病院中施受手術。</p>
<p>Now that the national life of the Soviet Union has become stable, there is no longer any need for illegal measures such as abortion. Therefore, this revision of the marriage law prohibits all illegal births that endanger the mother's body. Violators will be sentenced to one to three years in prison. However, if a doctor believes that abortion is necessary, it is not prohibited. At the same time, it is specified that pregnant women undergoing abortion must undergo surgery in national hospitals with the best equipment.</p>
<p>蘇聯政府更注意到對產婦的保護，特別研究無痛分娩的方法，最近已發現一種極有效果的方法，正在努力於這方法的普及。</p>
<p>The Soviet government has paid more attention to the protection of mothers and has conducted special research on painless childbirth methods. Recently, a very effective method has been discovered and efforts are being made to popularize this method.</p>
<p>以上是這次改革結婚决的梗概，由此可知蘇聯現在已重視到以家庭為中心的社會生活，但這次不是僅僅重視家庭生活，提倡舊的道德，而完全是新社會建設發展下必然的要求。確實，蘇聯現在的社會文化生活已一年一年地提高，人民生活富裕，國家經濟充實，在這一切社會基礎的反映下，為社會生活細胞的家庭，當然也要求着有更新的更健全的更美滿的生活，這次結婚的改革，便完成是由於這樣的動機。這確是蘇戀人民生活上的一大改革！</p>
<p>The above is an outline of this reform marriage decision. From this, we can see that the Soviet Union now attaches importance to family-centered social life, but this time it is not just about emphasizing family life and promoting old morality, but a necessary requirement under the development of new social construction. Indeed, the social and cultural life of the Soviet Union is improving year by year, the people's life is prosperous, and the national economy is enriched. Under the reflection of all these social foundations, the family, which is the cell of social life, of course also demands a newer, healthier and more satisfying life. The reform of this marriage was completed due to such motives. This is indeed a major reform in the lives of the Soviet people!</p>

<p>— 諸滕曼蓉</p>
<p>— Zhu Teng Manrong</p>
<p>老實說，一個女子如非另有了原因而才實行獨身主義的，那麽，到了相當年齡，誰都要經過一個「結婚」的階段。「結婚」當然是一樁大事；但是，我曾看見過很多的人？把「結婚」看得很輕，簡直不當一回事；不過她們也有理由，她們說：「結婚了要是「好」，那末不生問題；要是不好，則譬如沒有結婚，儘可離婚。」哼這種話說得好寫意，須知現行法律雖可離婚，但金錢與精神，一定兩受其損；並且譬如和甲結婚了不久就離婚，但離婚了再和乙結婚，但不久文離婚。像這樣的結婚離婚，眞是視同兒戲，試問，像這樣的女子，還能嫁得到好的丈夫嗎？還能得到社會的同情嗎？</p>
<p>To be honest, if a woman does not practice celibacy for other reasons, then at a certain age, everyone has to go through a stage of "marriage." "Marriage" is certainly a major event; but I have seen many people? Take "marriage" very lightly, simply not taking it seriously; but they also have reasons, they say: "If marriage is "good," then there is no problem; if it is not good, then it is as if you are not married, you can divorce." Hmph, these words are said so freely. It should be known that although the current law allows divorce, money and spirit will definitely be damaged; and for example, if you marry A and divorce soon, but after divorce you marry B, but soon divorce again. Marriage and divorce like this is really regarded as child's play. May I ask, can a woman like this marry a good husband? Can you get social sympathy?</p>
<p>「那麽要怎樣才能嫁得到好的丈夫呢？」這是一個很易解答的問題，自然，第一不要把「結婚」看得輕易，我們應當長存一個結婚了不能離婚的思想，這樣一來，自然會把「結婚」看得鄭重，把「結婚」看得鄭重了，那麽就須注重「擇夫」注重了「擇夫」，自然就能嫁到好的丈夫了！</p>
<p>"So how can you marry a good husband?" This is a very easy question to answer. Naturally, the first thing is not to take "marriage" lightly. We should always have the idea that we cannot divorce after marriage. In this way, we will naturally take "marriage" seriously. If we take "marriage" seriously, then we must pay attention to "choosing a husband." If we pay attention to "choosing a husband," we will naturally be able to marry a good husband!</p>
<p>不過「擇夫」也須預先定一個標準，但是這標準也得有些分寸；譬如，一個村姑想嫁出洋的留學生，一個女工想嫁銀行的總理，這都是出乎情理之外而又絕對不能成事實的擇夫標準；並且卽使萬一成了事實後，我敢說，將來也决無好果！所以我們在未定標準之前，須自己想想我是一個怎樣地位的入，應該和怎樣一等人結婚，是最合宜而又最美滿，總之，既不能媽虎，又不能苛求，須要合乎情理之內的定一個擇夫標準。</p>
<p>However, "choosing a husband" must also have a standard set in advance, but this standard must also have some propriety; for example, a village girl wants to marry a student studying abroad, and a female worker wants to marry the president of a bank. These are all standards for choosing a husband that are beyond reason and absolutely cannot become a reality; and even if it does become a reality, I dare say that there will be no good results in the future! Therefore, before we set a standard, we must think about what kind of person I am and what kind of people I should marry. It is the most appropriate and perfect. In short, we must neither be perfunctory nor demand too much. We must set a standard for choosing a husband that is within reason.</p>
<p>說起了擇夫標準，我又想起了一件關於這問題的事情：</p>
<p>Speaking of standards for choosing a husband, I remembered something about this issue again:</p>
<p>在我家的附近，有一　雜貨店，店主有一個女兒，二八年華，秀色可餐，她父親因為店中人少，所以教她輟了學助理店務。因此店中生意大好，附近的一輩子浮滑少年，且和她取了個「雜貨西施」的綽號！</p>
<p>Near my house, there is a grocery store. The owner has a daughter who is sixteen years old. She is beautiful and appetizing. Her father, because there were few people in the store, asked her to drop out of school to assist in the store business. As a result, the store's business is very good. The slippery young men nearby gave her the nickname "Grocery Xishi"!</p>
<p>「雜貨西施」到了這樣的年齡，當然有很多的人來和她作伐，但是，橫不成，豎不就，說了很多人，都不稱她的心</p>
<p>"Grocery Xishi" has reached this age, of course, many people come to make matches for her, but, it doesn't work horizontally or vertically. Many people have been talked about, but none of them meet her heart.</p>
<p>隔了很久，她終於和人結婚了，據說，對方是一個很漂亮的西裝少年，原來她就早定了一個擇夫標準：「不是西裝少年決不結婚！」所以她在初見時就十二分地滿意，然而，她就因了這滿意而鑄成大錯！原來，這漂亮的西裝少年，是一個毫無學識的理髮匠，她事前單看了表面，並沒有細細地探聽他的職業與學識，到結了婚才知道他是理髮匠，但是大錯鑄成，悔已莫及！</p>
<p>After a long time, she finally married someone. It is said that the other party is a very handsome young man in a suit. It turns out that she had set a standard for choosing a husband long ago: "I will never marry if he is not a young man in a suit!" So she was very satisfied when she first met him, but she made a big mistake because of this satisfaction! It turns out that this handsome young man in a suit is an uneducated barber. She only looked at the surface beforehand and did not inquire about his occupation and knowledge in detail. She only found out that he was a barber after she got married, but the big mistake was made, and it was too late to regret it!</p>

<p>在自認為非常時期的日本，十一年度的總預算，已達到二十三億以上。內中用於擴充軍備的費用的，當然已經可觀了。但是日本的國民還是紛紛獻金報國，以為後盾。小學生曾集香烟錫紙，以購愛國號飛機。現在又有一部份的婦女，提倡頭髮報國。在國難時期的我國，既沒有强力國防的，又無充分的經濟，不知我國女性將以何種方法，報答祖國。</p>
<p>In Japan, which considers itself in a period of emergency, the total budget for the eleventh year has reached over 2.3 billion. Of course, the expenses used to expand armaments are already considerable. However, the Japanese people are still donating money to serve the country as a backing. Elementary school students have collected cigarette tin foil to purchase patriotic airplanes. Now, a part of women are advocating serving the country with their hair. In our country, which is in a period of national crisis, without strong national defense and without sufficient economy, I wonder what methods our women will use to repay their motherland.</p>
<p>當一個女子在每天梳頭的時候，總有幾根頭髮，隨着木梳落下。普通便丟在垃圾箱裏，付之一炬。神奈川縣厚木町女子靑年團’於去年年底開始向各村各町，喚起婦女，囑將梳下的頭髮保存起來，一個月中已積得三十二斤，為製假髮店購去。得洋二元五角，獻與橫須賀海軍鎮守府，為國防費。得前大角海相的感謝狀、今歲四月將擴大宣傳，徵收全國女子加入。蒐集的方法，先用印有說明語的紙袋，發給村中各住家。每天便由女子靑年團派人挨戶收集，並以空袋調換，這個方法是仿警察局在暑天收集蒼蠅的方法。日本婦女對此很表同情，並不以兒戲視之。</p>
<p>When a woman combs her hair every day, there are always a few hairs that fall with the wooden comb. Usually they are thrown in the trash can and burned. The Kanagawa Prefecture Atsugi Town Women's Youth Group' began to call on women in various villages and towns at the end of last year to save the hair that was combed off. In one month, they have accumulated 32 catties, which were purchased by wig shops. Get two yuan and five jiao, donate it to the Yokosuka Naval Base for national defense expenses. Received a letter of thanks from former Minister of the Navy, Admiral Osumi. In April of this year, publicity will be expanded and women across the country will be recruited to join. The collection method is to first use paper bags printed with explanatory words and distribute them to each household in the village. Every day, the Women's Youth Group sends people to collect them door-to-door and exchange them for empty bags. This method is based on the method used by the police station to collect flies in the summer. Japanese women express great sympathy for this and do not regard it as child's play.</p>
<p>據做假髮的人說，現在科學雖然昌明，但是用人工製造頭髮，尚未發明。從前假髮都是用於舞台上的。自從都會女子，盛行剪髮之後。當出嫁時候，需用髮髻而一時又留不起來，於是不得不利用假髮。此外藝妓的習慣，是必需有高大的髮髻。剪髮女子，做藝妓的時候，也用假髮。故近年以來，假髮的銷路大增，而來源却仍是很少。製造假髮的頭髮</p>
<h3 id="e244">Self-Narration of Wang Aimei, a Female Cannery Worker <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Want to eat, first need money; without working, where would money come from? Not reading, not knowing characters, is like a blind person with open eyes; earning a living by labor is the most honorable person in the world.</p>
<p>In the past six months, this reporter has interviewed more than twenty women, and each special feature has been disclosed in this publication. It is gratifying to have received sympathy from readers, inspiring people endlessly! Among these twenty-odd people are female pioneers, academic experts, social leaders, and new virtuous wives and good mothers, all of whom are rare talents in the female community. Each speaks their aspirations, each exhausts their intentions, and all discussions must have unique insights. As for the main purpose of interviewing them: first, to hear famous sayings and honest opinions, instructing women on how to be modern women? Second, to commend everyone's career and improve the status of women; third, to give women an opportunity to express their opinions, to expand everyone's aspirations, aiming to improve family life and education, advocating equal rights for men and women, and advocating that women establish a spirit of impartiality and selflessness, and jointly contribute to the cause of society and the country. However, women's issues are multifaceted. In the future, in addition to the established policies, we will from time to time collect living materials of working women to seek a way out for women's liberation. Here, we will first introduce the life of a female cannery worker, which can also reveal her inner reflections.</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>The Kangyuan Cannery is recognized as a national goods factory with sound organization and successful implementation of scientific management. The day before yesterday, when I walked into the factory, hundreds of workers were working diligently. Among them was a female worker numbered 782. Her operation was indeed agile. I then invited her to the reception room for a normal conversation. Her name is Wang Aimei, a native of Jiangwan, Shanghai. She is only twenty-eight years old. Sadly, she has been a widow for two years! I first investigated her background and family situation. She said: "I grew up in Jiangwan, where my family has been farming for generations. I got married at the age of twenty-two. My husband was originally a foreman at the Kangyuan factory. After marriage, I also entered the factory to work. In the past six or seven years, we lived by our craftsmanship and were quite comfortable. Unfortunately, my husband passed away two years ago. The orphan is now only four years old and is being cared for by my loving mother. I remember that when my late husband was alive, we were very loving and never had disagreements. I wanted to build a family business, but who would have expected such a tragic change. I only lament my thin fate. I now live near the factory, and the monthly cost of food and lodging is twelve yuan, and the cost of clothing and miscellaneous items is five or six yuan. The monthly wage, including overtime and Sunday work, is twenty yuan, which is enough to maintain life. My husband's old mother is still alive. Because I have very little spare time, I cannot often serve her. After all, it is hard for poor people, and the body is not free. Earning money is not easy, and it is really difficult to do my filial piety. I guess rich people can always do their filial piety, right?"</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>The next question was about her work interest...colleague feelings and treatment in the factory. She thought for a while and said in an orderly manner: "I am in the packaging section of the canning department. I start work at 7 am every morning until 12 noon, and from 2 pm to 5:30 pm. I also work overtime for two or three hours. I work, eat, rest, and sleep like this day and night. When today is done, I do it again tomorrow. People are like machines. As for the joys and sorrows, I don't feel much. I want to eat, first I need money, and to get money, I must work. We are poor people, with no permanent property, relying on our own hands, working one day and eating one day. We are used to it and don't feel the hardship. I think only by being calm and relying on our own labor can we seek personal survival. Otherwise, how can the world be peaceful! There are more than a hundred female workers in this factory. We go in and out together every day, but the factory rules do not allow talking during work, so everyone is familiar but does not talk much. Every Saturday, a general meeting is held, bringing all 400 workers in the factory together to listen to the general manager's instructions. Besides that, there is little contact. My opinions on general female workers can be divided into two aspects: (1) Some are quick-eyed and quick-handed, and ship goods quickly; (2) Some pay attention to cleanliness and are strong; (3) Some are steady in their work and do not need to be managed by others. But there are few good people and many bad people. I most disapprove of things like (1) being lazy at work and not listening to others' advice; (2) not being determined to work and hindering others; (3) dirty clothes and weak health. The factory treats us very well. For example, if a female worker is pregnant, she first registers with the personnel department and goes to the designated hospital. The expenses are provided by the factory, and she gets one month of leave before and after childbirth, with full pay. This is also the case when she is sick. In all fairness, it can be considered preferential treatment."</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Finally, she was asked how many years she had studied when she was a child... How can she be satisfied with her life? She expressed her sadness about these points: "I only blame my parents for spoiling me too much. What's the use of studying for more than a year? My hometown is more than ten miles away from the school, and it's too far to go back and forth. To this day, not being able to read books and newspapers is really like being blind with open eyes. Probably only two or three out of ten female workers are literate. If you don't study when you are young, you will suffer a lot when you are old. Speaking of my life, there is nothing I am not satisfied with. Earning a living by my own efforts is the freest and most honorable person in the world. I don't dream in vain either. I only hope to raise my son to be an adult, read more books, and study hard. With strong skills, he can do some outstanding work and never be like his mother, suffering here."</p>
<h3 id="e245">Standard Wife <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Man Ling Huang</p>
<p>My friend works in a factory. They have two children and an old nanny. His wife is extremely capable and can handle all the big and small things in the house herself. I will write down some of her work for the reference of female compatriots. Can you not consider me excessive for calling her "standard"?</p>
<p>Every day before six o'clock, when her husband and children are still sound asleep, she gets up quietly. At this time, she calls the old nanny to start the fire and cook porridge. On the one hand, she washes up herself first, and then helps the old nanny sweep the house. At seven o'clock, the two children get up, and she washes their faces and tidies up their books for them. On the one hand, she teaches them one by one how they should do things themselves. At the same time, she orders the old nanny to prepare porridge and vegetables for the children to eat. At eight o'clock, the old nanny sends the children to school. Her husband likes to sleep and does not get up until after eight fifteen. After the children and servants leave home, she prepares the things that her husband will use when he gets up, such as shirts, socks, handkerchiefs, etc., and puts them one by one on the side of the bed. The water for washing his face is ready next to the washbasin. While her husband is washing his face, she has already prepared breakfast. At eight thirty, her husband goes to work, and the old nanny comes back. Then she goes to the vegetable market. Before leaving, she always instructs the old nanny to wash the floor. Before eleven thirty, she helps to cut vegetables and cook. At eleven forty, she has already prepared the children's meals, and the old nanny sends the food away. Her husband always comes back at twelve fifteen, and of course, she takes care of lunch. After the meal, she reads the newspaper and chats with her husband. At two o'clock, her husband goes back to the factory, and she starts sewing or ironing clothes. At this time, the old nanny washes clothes. At three thirty, the old nanny still takes the children home, and she makes some snacks for them to eat. From four thirty to six o'clock, she supervises the children to study. At six fifteen, her husband returns home. Seven o'clock is dinner time. After dinner, she reads magazines and novels, or writes letters and records daily expenses. Her husband goes to visit neighbors and chat. At nine o'clock, they go to sleep. However, because the environment in Shanghai is corrupt, her husband sometimes has to go to the dance hall. Seeing this need, she also learns to dance. Within the possible range, she also does things in the society. She has a broad vision and a smart brain. She can manage the family according to the environment and teach the children according to the times. She does not have the habits of a Shanghai young lady at all. She never asks her husband to worry about the affairs of the family. Even if his income is not high, she can deal with it calmly. Except for her husband's suits and shirts and her own silk cheongsam, everything else is made by her own two hands. She has a thorough view of life, considerable knowledge, a kind attitude, and a hardworking spirit. The four words "standard wife" can truly be worthy of her.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Food Configuration for Worker Breastfeeding <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yu</p>
<p>Cow's milk one pound (500 c.c.)</p>
<p>Sugar 5% of which half is water (1/5 pound 100cc or three taels of water in sugar)</p>
<p>Lactic acid forty-five to sixty drops (if more is needed, increase the side ratio; if not so much is needed, decrease the ratio.)</p>
<p>(Note) This type of milk should not be made with iron or lead utensils, because it can react chemically with lactic acid. The hand dripping lactic acid should be slow, and the hand mixing the milk should be fast, so that the lactic acid dripped down will not solidify the protein in the milk and form lumps.</p>
<p>Preparation of Milk Powder</p>
<p>Using milk powder instead of human milk has more drawbacks than fresh cow's milk. Because after cow's milk is dried into powder by heat and pressure, one of the vitamins in it is destroyed. There are many types of milk powder, and many mothers mistakenly believe in the merchants' propaganda and think it is so safe and happy to use it, which is the most dangerous. Milk powder can also be used for mothers with special diseases, and if it is not easy to get fresh cow's milk at home. The dosage can be based on the instructions of various milk powders. However, a few cc (C.C.) of orange juice or tomato juice, or tea, should be added to each breastfeed.</p>
<p>Feeding Method</p>
<p>The milk bottle should be round and have no concave corners for easy cleaning. Do not use bottles connected by leather tubes. The holes on the nipples should not be too large to prevent milk from entering the baby's mouth too quickly. After each feeding, the milk bottle and nipple must be washed, boiled, and stored properly. The temperature of the milk should be appropriate. Before each feeding, you can drop a little milk on the back of an adult's hand to test the temperature. When feeding, the milk should be directed towards the nipple to prevent air from being fed into the baby's stomach. After feeding, you can pick up the baby and place the baby's head on the adult's shoulder, hold it with one hand, and gently pat it with the other hand to expel the air that has entered the stomach, so as not to cause discomfort in the stomach. According to the above method, feed six or five times a day (once in the middle of the night can be reduced as appropriate due to sleep), once every four hours. The amount of milk should be determined according to the size of the baby. After it is slightly larger, other foods containing vitamins should be added.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Longde Lane <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>It has been a long time since I went to the southern city. My experience in Longde Lane five years ago has gradually faded away like a photo that has been stored for too long. At first, we entrusted the entire family to house number thirty-four inside. I don't know who lives there now. People are really the most active things!</p>
<p>Less than half a month ago, I had to go through Xinbeimen and into Jiumu Land alone for the sake of the children in the family. The scenery on the street still retained some familiar traces, which made me involuntarily feel a very sincere old friendship. So, after finishing the business, I specially took a detour and bent to Longde Lane.</p>
<p>The red wall bricks have gradually faded into light yellow, and the painted alley doors have been peeled off like a patchwork coat worn by beggars. The small shops and shoe repair stalls at the entrance of the alley have also been replaced by new people. Only the Jiangbei people who watched the alley are still there and have not left.</p>
<p>My goal was originally to visit an old neighbor in house number thirty-five, a Suzhou young woman whose face was always yellow and thin, but very kind and loved to read books. But before I had walked to the door of house number thirty-five, the Jiangbei people who watched the alley had already shouted in a loud voice, "The Li family moved away long ago!"</p>
<p>Moving is a very common thing, of course, there is nothing surprising. However, the talkative Jiangbei people went on to automatically tell me the reason why his family moved away, which immediately made me feel infinitely sad.</p>
<p>The Li family was not a propertied class. Their lives depended entirely on Mr. Li's income from the telegraph office. However, they still had several relatives living with them. Everyone was very happy and lively, and they often held banquets and played cards, which was very extravagant. It really seemed like they were doing well. Only the Li family's wife still had some brains. She often told me behind their backs that the economy was very tight and that she absolutely hated this kind of extravagance. Unfortunately, her husband refused to listen to her and continued to mess around. This person originally had lung disease, and coupled with the day and night of messing around, the symptoms became more and more serious. He finally died of vomiting blood a year ago. Those relatives, seeing that they had no support, scattered and left, leaving the Li family's wife to take her two very young children back to the countryside in the cold. According to the Jiangbei people, the travel expenses back were only enough after selling many things. Those children were so thin that only a handful of bones remained. It seemed that they were also suffering from minor tuberculosis and could not live long.</p>
<p>When I walked out of Longde Lane, it still seemed like I could hear the sound of the Li family playing cards in my ears.</p>

<h3 id="e248">The Problem of Relieving Unemployed Youth <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>The unemployment problem of educated youth has now reached a serious stage. Every year, among the graduates of various schools across the country, except for a small number who have jobs, most of the rest suffer from the "graduation is unemployment" problem. As a result, not only the youth themselves feel bored, but also the society gradually shows signs of unrest. Recently, graduates of various universities in Beiping organized the "Service Movement Alliance" and held petitions, which is enough to show the seriousness of this problem.</p>
<p>In order to cope with the current major problems, the authorities have come up with various methods to relieve unemployed youth in order to solve the problem. The Executive Yuan has recently decided to do its best to select graduates from colleges and secondary schools: (1) The Yuan will consult with the Examination Yuan to hold a national college entrance examination once a year, and ask them to change the treatment as appropriate; (2) The government will hold colleges above the special college level in the Central Political School. Recent graduates who have not yet found employment will be given short-term training. and internships, after which they will be tested as appropriate, and the government will try to help them find employment; (3) At least 50,000 teachers and instructors are needed for the promotion of compulsory education and mass education in the 25th year, and most of them plan to select, train, and assign graduates from junior high schools and junior and senior normal schools who have not yet found employment. If these measures can be implemented one by one, the unemployment problem of educated youth will not be completely solved, but at least a part of the relief can be obtained.</p>
<p>However, we still have some opinions on the measures taken by the authorities to select graduates. Holding a national college entrance examination once a year is naturally a method of selecting talents. However, the national college entrance examination has been held in the past, and it is said that many of the successful candidates still do not have jobs. Therefore, it is important for the authorities to hold the national college entrance examination, and it is especially necessary to arrange as many jobs as possible for the successful candidates. Otherwise, only giving titles without giving jobs still loses the meaning of relieving unemployment. A piece of certificate cannot be eaten.</p>
<p>In the end, the authorities have established a preparatory committee for the employment guidance class for college graduates and above to carry out everything for training graduates. The training period is set at six months. The internship period is currently set at three to six months. During the training period, each person will receive a subsidy of 30 yuan. During the internship period, each person will receive a subsidy of 40 yuan. These measures are appropriate, but the number of students is only limited to 1,000 unemployed graduates from various schools in the past three years, which is too small. And those who graduated before three years have no opportunity to receive training, and the relief is also unfair. We hope that the authorities will expand the training class as much as possible so that more unemployed graduates have the opportunity to receive training and employment.</p>
<p>However, solving the unemployment problem of educated youth is not an easy task. Selecting graduates is only a temporary remedy. For further relief, we must start by reforming the current education system. The decline of the social economy is indeed a major reason for the unemployment of today's graduates, but the defects of the education system also make it so. The former Minister of Education reported that there are fewer unemployed youths studying practical subjects than those studying other subjects. We hope that the authorities will improve this. The Beiping University Graduates Service Movement Alliance has put forward suggestions: (1) reform the education system, (2) improve the examination system, (3) improve the standards for the appointment of local administrative personnel, (4) implement the national teacher system, (5) equalize salaries, and (6) strictly implement the evaluation and performance appraisal system, which are also ways to relieve unemployment, and we hope that the authorities will adopt them.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Fate <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Mingzi</p>
<p>(Fate is like a bottomless well, opening its fearful mouth in the dark world of night, as if containing a victorious pride in its sneer, waiting for the stumbling traveler!</p>
<p>So, another ordinary soul, in the green age, quietly sank into the dark and deep cave of fate.</p>
<p>There, there is no air, no clear water, no sunlight. People groped blindly, exploring, until old age, until death...)</p>
<p>Thinking back for a long time, it has been quite a while since I lived in this remote and desolate small village; the harvest is bad, and it has become common to hear the unpleasant quarrels and beatings of the villagers outside during the day; in the sleepless nights of deliberation, I hear some faint cries mixed with the sound of the clapper in the distance, and the next day, I hear that the husband or woman of that family jumped into the well or hanged themselves because they could not borrow rice! These have already become so common that they have lost the qualification to cause a stir. Everyone treats it as a common trivial matter: they listen to it, frown, then put it aside and no longer talk about it, and quickly forget it completely without paying attention. The people in the village are thus removed day by day? As ordinary as brushing away a speck of dust.</p>
<p>Because of this, when I heard the woman say that there was no rice left, and there was nothing to pawn, we all thought of the small river flowing with muddy water in front of the door, and the tall and sturdy branches that were enough to hang people to death.</p>
<p>(Dangerous, ominous and terrible thoughts!</p>
<p>Thinking so, I felt even more afraid: people who fall into the trap of fate should never have the hope of transcending life, right? Fate is cruel... But, fate! What exactly is it?</p>
<p>Maybe it's not destined to embrace life so broken? When I was in school, wasn't I a happy and lively young man? So, after three years of wandering melted people into a pile of broken pieces of decline, they came to live in this remote place with their heads upside down.</p>
<p>However, everything is the same bad! The broken pieces of life can no longer be sewn together! Even if I only receive a little insignificant news from acquaintances over the years, I will quickly think of the vast world outside and the fate floating in this vast world.</p>
<p>"Let's go to the outside world again and try to find a chance to live!" Thinking so, I pawned even the worthless furniture, regardless of whether I was sure or not, and regardless of the woman's hesitation; in order to find acquaintances, I had to make my face look good, and I had to prepare some painful gifts with the money from the pawn! Just for the sake of living, try the means of fate again?</p>
<p>A kind of sad mood floated up, and the woman and children were with me, like soldiers on an expedition, like beggars in exile. The sentences I saw in some books were deeply engraved in my memory;</p>
<p>"Recently, there is a lack of supply in the kitchen, and the baby is crying and the rice basket is empty; the mother whispers in the ear of the child: Daddy has a new poem to visit the minister!"</p>
<p>(Clearly, a tragedy exists in the world, like moldy moss: people have to use their own tears to provide laughter for others!)</p>
<p>Because of this, I forgot the past story of being played by fate, forgot my own tears, and blindly threw myself and two lives into the hands of unknown fate in the middle of no certainty. (What is knowable in this world?)</p>
<p>A river, a sailing ship, and a third-class cabin berth, carrying some uncertain lives, sailed quickly towards an even greater unknown. Tears need to be saved to exchange for people's laughter (I really dare not think about it!), and people's laughter will be the master of their own fate...</p>
<p>Everything is uncertain: in the confusion, in the noise of people, I saw the gray land, and took the woman and children, squeezed into a group of people with the same wandering, and stepped on the shore, which, it is said, is the metropolis! How beautiful are the roads in the metropolis:</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The woman paid three coppers to a fortune teller at the dock to ask about "the year's fortune", and when she walked to the street, she felt a little confused. Obviously: the black hand of unknown fate once again fell on my head.</p>
<h3 id="e250">The Big Fellow <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— By One</p>
<p>It was not until the sun had set that the big fellow slowly, listlessly, dragged his weary steps homeward; but when he reached his doorway, he stopped, tormented by anguish, lacking the courage to push open the half-closed gate.</p>
<p>His brow was furrowed deeply, and in the dim twilight his gaunt face, ravaged by hunger, appeared even more pallid and terrifying. His sunken eyes stared blankly into space, and his constricted chest heaved violently—his ribs seemed about to pierce his thin skin. He gasped for breath, his limbs twitching weakly, exhausted from the day's toil. He leaned half his body against the peeling wall, seeking a moment's respite, recalling the day's painful encounters.</p>
<p>"I have no relatives, no friends! I..."</p>
<p>Suddenly, the big fellow slammed his fist against the mud wall, letting out a ragged cry that startled his sick wife inside, who erupted into a fit of violent dry coughing, the harsh rasping sounds audible even from outside. As if remembering something, the big fellow pushed himself off the wall, flung open the door, and rushed inside.</p>
<p>"How is it...Big Fellow..." his wife asked in a faint, weak voice laced with a desperate hope.</p>
<p>He didn't answer.</p>
<p>His wife broke into another fit of coughing.</p>
<p>"What the hell are you living for? You…you, living, living…you…!" The big fellow, like a maddened beast, lunged to his wife's bedside, grabbed her hair with one hand, and began beating her with the other.</p>
<p>She only gasped and coughed, offering no resistance as the big fellow struck her. She opened her mouth several times to speak, but the blows prevented her.</p>
<p>"It's because of you that I'm poor and miserable! You, you, you hurry up and die, you…!" The big fellow's fists rained down on his wife, again and again, as she silently endured the beating, collapsing into his arms. Finally, the big fellow could no longer strike; he stopped, tears streaming down his face. He suddenly began to sob, clutching his wife tightly. She smiled bitterly, reaching out a withered hand to wipe away his tears.</p>
<p>"Hit me, Big Fellow! ...I, I don't hate you, I hate myself for burdening you, I... I wish you would beat me to death..." The wife wept too.</p>
<p>"No, I was wrong, I shouldn't have hit you, you're sick..." The big fellow's tears fell on his wife's face. "I'm angry, I'm angry at those bastards, they're not human!..."</p>
<p>"What?...Didn't you go to the boss's place either?..."</p>
<p>"I went, I pleaded and begged him, asked him to lend me some money for food and to treat your illness... He refused...I knelt and kowtowed, but he still refused... Heartless! ...I used to work hard for him, but he's forgotten it all. I said I'd pay it back sooner or later, but he just gritted his teeth, unwilling to part with a single cent, and finally had people drag me out! ...Damn him! ...Beast! ...They even kicked me a few times! ...I'm angry, I'm…?..."</p>
<p>"Oh!...It would be better if I died, burdening you, I'm so sorry...Big Fellow!..."</p>
<p>"You can't die! You... I'll find a way, I..." He stretched out his thin hand, seemingly confident.</p>
<p>But no "solution" flew in through the window; nor did it leap in from outside the door. The big fellow's waving hand dropped, slowly hanging down. He looked out the window, into a sea of darkness.</p>

<p>The wind is calling, the sea is roaring, the waves are beckoning, when the night is deep, the moon is shining in the sky, young friends, he plunged into the embrace of the ocean; swallowed by the water's waves, the high tide. How could we have known? From now on, farewell forever! From now on, we have been deprived of our ambitious hero; from now on, we lack you at our front lines. From now on, where do you drift? The homeland is far away! From now on, remembering people thousands of miles away, only dreams are distant!</p>
<p>Great ambition is empty, hard work is not in vain, listening to thousands of people singing the heroic songs you composed, you should be smiling in the nine springs.
