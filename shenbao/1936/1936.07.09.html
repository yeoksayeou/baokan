<h3>縣鄉銀行性質的檢討</h3>
<p>— 禹</p>
<p>財部籌議已久的普設縣鄉銀行的計畫在不久的將來大槪可以推行起來了縣鄉銀行章程草案聽說已經擬訂完畢就原則講這類銀行的設立在一方面可以使都巿和鄉村間及鄉村和鄕村間的資金融通得更圓滑些在另一方面也可以使農民掙脫土劣地主之高利貸的束縛然而就實際情形一加研究我們卻不能不有一些過慮因爲縣鄉銀行是要在各地普遍分設的政府的資力有限在銀行的資本上恐怕不得不借助於當地的豪紳和地主這一來他們在銀行中就很容易佔到重要的地位將實際的管理權直接或間接操縱起來流弊所至不但農民得不到實專而且地方豪紳地主也許會利用這種金融機關來加緊對於農民的剝削這是違反設立縣鄉銀行的本旨的</p>
<p>我們以爲縣鄉銀行的主要任務是在調劑內地金融運銷國內土產援助貧苦農民以謀農業生產力的增進那麽放欵對象務須有嚴格的限制當然對於眞正從事生產的農民是要儘量貸放的可是對於一切舶來產品郤除絕對必要者外應不予以運銷的便利而對於不事生產的土豪劣紳允須嚴防他們借了縣鄉銀行的欵項再以高利轉貸於貧農而從中取利此其一</p>
<p>中國農民歷來受了高利貨的剝削痛苦很深縣鄉銀行放欵利率務宜儘量减低使農民得以低利資金去從事於再生產同時關於農民借欵的抵押品範圍允須定得寬泛應儘可能接受信用的担保（如農民互保）因爲一般農民除了僅有的幾種必要生產工具以外恐無他種財產可資抵押如果必欲强其繳存嚴格的担保品則大多數貧農不得其門而入仍然不能不呻吟於土劣地主高利貨剝削之下此其二</p>
<p>縣鄉銀行雖然受着政府的管轄但爲本身的健全着想務須保持相當的獨立性政府方面不宜任意向此類銀行移借欵項銷售債券而地方政府的勒借和强索允須設法防止此其三</p>
<p>今日內地農民的生活可謂困苦已極了縣鄉銀行如果經營得法固然可以收到救濟的成效可是辦理不善也一定會變成有名無實我們希望政府方面在籌辦以前就上述幾點加以考慮那麽未來的縣鄕銀行對於內地的民生才有眞正的利益了</p>

<p>蒙特婁　蒙特婁會議因英俄代表發生爭執、俄代表李維諾夫或將逕返莫斯科、果爾則該會議將歸失敗、李氏已接本國政府訓令、非於某某數項要求獲有滿意、則卽退出會議、蘇俄最注重之要求、為准許俄艦有出入黑海之完全自由、按自會議開幕後、英俄意見卽相牴牾、俄代表指英國之態度專以妨碍蘇俄為務、繼乃請示於本國政府、而接上項訓令、李氏今日午後與英總代表史坦萊勳爵會商、謂如不能商妥折衷辦法、則渠擬首途回國云、今晨英代表團提出第十六條草案、修正前提之草案、其中含有　土耳其如以為其安全受威脅時、則有權封鎖海峽、禁止交戰國軍艦之通過、　在海濱各國無一為交戰國之戰爭中、應禁止交戰國之軍艦通過海峽、蘇俄旋提出答案，主張禁止交戰國軍艦通過海峽、惟交戰國如為履行國聯盟的下之義務而出此、不在此例、兩項建議均未經會議探納、俄代表團聲稱、彼等之修正文乃重要之讓步、而英國甚至對此猶持强硬之異議云、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>蒙德婁　蒙德婁會議、頃於本日晨間賡續開會、常就英國提案第十六條、卽主張黑海在戰時亦應開放者、加以討論、但未能獲有確定之結果、并定於明日晨間再行討論、關於此層、英日土耳其三國代表已向各該國政府請訓、英法俄羅馬尼亞四國代表已定於本日午後進行非正式談話、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>瑞士蒙德婁城　蒙德婁會議、本日舉行非公開全體大會、當將英國提案（共二十六條）第一至第十五條審查完畢、幷定於明晨十時繼續開會、討論各國軍艦在戰時通過海峽一項問題、關於此層、英國提案第十六條主張黑海在戰時、亦應繼續開放、俾各國軍艦得以自由通過、并建議組織常設巡防隊、俾與土耳其希臘兩國合作、以為維持海峽開放之用、此在蘇聯則主張黑海在戰時應加以封鎖、故對於英國所持自由通過之議、表示反對云、本日會議所討論者、係關於各國軍襤在平時通過海峽并在黑海中停留各項問題、茲將最要數項紀述如下、</p>
<p>關於運油船潛水艇暨航空母艦通過海峽問題、（甲）運油船、土耳其原案主張應與各種軍艦一律看待、而加以限制、此在法國代表彭古（前不管部閣員）與龐梭（駐土耳其大使）二人則表示反對、并堅持法國艦隊應有補充媒油之權利、結果會議决定運油船不作軍襤看待、其通過海峽得以不受限制、并得免付捐稅、（乙）潛水艇、土耳其暨蘇聯代表均主禁止通過海峽、法國代表雖曾維持傳統見解、卽潛水艇應與他種軍艦視同一律、而准其通過、但因黑海具有特殊政治形勢之故、法國此項見解終當予以放棄、（丙）航空母艦、英國代表主張應准其通過、土俄兩國亦表反對、而允以蘇聯反對最烈、英國代表卒乃聲稱、會議若果接受蘇聯主張、渠卽不得不向本國政府請訓云、關於乙丙兩項、大抵土俄兩國主張可以獲得滿足、　英國主張非黑海沿岸任何一國軍艦准許停留黑海中者、其噸位不得超過該處各國軍艦總噸位四分之三、關於此層、會議須以全體一致、議决將四分之三之比例、减為三分之二、（按此項總噸位、英國主張定為三萬噸、遇有特殊情形時、得加至四萬五千噸）</p>

<h3>意國拒不出席</h3>
<p>取消地中海恊定爲要挾俄法海軍互助德所深忌</p>
<p>蒙德婁　蒙德婁會議重新開會之後、意大利藉口地中海英艦未撤、地中海沿岸各國互助協定未廢、拒不派員參加、此間各國代表團左右人士對於意國態度、均嚴詞加以批評、並恐該國或將更進一步、提出益較重大之要求、以為重行參加國際合作事業之條伴、如要求修正國聯會盟的、卽其一端也、但意國現雖缺席、蒙德婁會議仍當繼續進行、或逕自締結公的、卽無意國在內、亦所不計、至於土國在韃靼尼爾與博斯破魯斯兩海峽設置防禦工事一項要求、則不論意國態度如何、終當應允之云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>南巡佳話</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者石英</p>
<p>浙江物產的今昔</p>
<p>浙江境內自然環境的區分，在錢塘江以西，卽杭州嘉興一帶，呌浙西，土地平原肥沃，盛產蠶絲和食糧·錢塘江以東的大部份，統稱浙東，其中又分兩區，自錢塘江至甌江，卽紹興鄞縣臨海永嘉一帶，是濱海區，山多田少，但富漁鹽之利·餘在錢塘江及甌江的上游，如建德金華麗水衢縣一帶，是呌山地區，山險土瘠，出產多爲林木茶葉，舊時風氣很閉塞，現因浙贛鐵路及各公路相繼通車，文化才大有進步·</p>
<p>浙江七十五縣中，農民以養蠶爲主要副業的，竟有五十八縣，每年絲繭產量，幾占全國絲產的半數·浙西太湖流域各縣的出產，允較著名，最上品的「七里絲」，卽出在吳興（湖州）的菱湖，南潯等鄉鎮，而絲廠很少，大多數是農婦用手繅的，自二十年以後，絲價大跌，每擔竟山五十餘元，跌到二十元左右，一般養蠶婦的生活，也就每况愈下了·杜苟鶴有一首詩，★粉色全無飢色加，豈知人世有榮華，年年道我蠶辛苦，底事渾身着苧麻？」恰可爲她們的生活寫照·去今兩年★絲業漸有抬頭之象，當局已着手用科學方法，倡用改良種，試騐電氣育蠶，從事絲繭統制，想藉此挽回浙絲業的厚利，可謂法良意美·但在推行之初，須防操之過切，以免發生像某處强迫發售改良種，竟至引起農民的反感·本來辦這些對農村經濟含有救濟性質的事業，須確具有犧牲的精神，而實際避免自己的飯盌，無形中又放在農民的肩膀上·如此，庶乎奄奄★息的養蠶業，★有充實的力量，去對★日本人造絲的傾銷</p>
<p>喜歡去茶館品茗，或者常過茶店的朋友們，關於「龍井嫩芽的芳名，當早已知道，這就是杭州的特產·不過浙茶的出口，還要以紹興一帶的「平水茶」，首稱大宗·杭州輸出的綠茶，却多來自安微屯溪，就是在西湖買到的龍井茶，也難說不是魚目混珠的置物·此外永嘉還產紅茶，不過數量不多·近年中國茶在國際貿易的市塲★，不幸已被日本茶，逐漸奪去★還有一般醉心洋化的國人，喜歡喝舶來品咖啡★類的飲料，速國產上品飲料的龍井，也不惜把它貶入冷宮，這樣★來，常然一部分是洩了浙茶業經濟的氣，同時也是愛用外國貨的同胞，目家拆了自家的台。</p>
<p>浙東山地區，旅行其間，凡見綠油油的森林，多是松杉柏楊之村。木商把此等木材，賤價收買到手，（江山兩三丈高的杉木，每株僅售一角左右），編成木筏，順錢塘江流而下，集於杭州的閘口，分銷浙西及蘇錫一帶，每年產量，曾達一千萬元以上。近年因各地建築物，多採用洋松和鋼泥，故浙江木材銷路，已大非昔比。一面因人民生活貧困，不得已殺鵝求蛋，把許多還未成材的幼林木，在丁丁的斧聲中，摧殘了它們的小生命，只是去做業火燒。試看錢塘江流，雖然還是滔滔不絕的流着，而當年舳艫千里的木筏，却有難以爲繼的現象了。好在浙東有多少山林，不種植也會天然長出新林未來，只銷加以人力上的議衛，（常然種種也須兼顧的），那麼，這一襲雜色殘破的山林外衣，必將變成無縫天衣式的綠色摩登裝。</p>
<p>餘如濱海區的漁業，正受着日漁輪越界捕魚的影響，金華的火腿，又有蘇省江北火腿公司的新來爭銷，紹興酒及各縣造紙，更因九一八的事變，而斷送了東四省的大銷路，一言以蔽之，都是「不景氣」。不過建德金華等縣所產桐油，去年以來，却發了一筆意外的橫財。杭州灣兩岸的產棉區，允其是餘姚所產的「姚花」都非常有希望。長興的煤礦，質量也極好，可是還未大規模的開採，致浙贛路所用的煤，還要遠自華北運來。好在等到南（昌）萍（鄉）鐵路築成，這問題就可以解决了，此事不僅與浙省燃料問題有關，望當局趕緊開快車去進行吧。</p>
<p>從杭州搭浙贛車赴浙東，先渡錢塘江，正逢江水漲期，江面寬四五里，在碼頭上望着浩浩蕩蕩的波潮，很像南京浦口的輪渡，不過這裏深度和流速，比長江究竟差得多了。錢江渡口的兩岸，各有一個很長的碼頭，伸及江中的大溜邊，然後用船渡過。江西碼頭，俗稱洋橋，長的千步，上面還有鋼臂水泥的頂蓬，走過很像綏步北平頤和園的遊廊。這裏左往右來的行人，却是些提箱握杖的旅客，踏着和諧堅實步調的脚夫，以及抬着古香古色的兩人轎，我自己裏在他們的行伍裏，還有嘩啦嘩啦的水聲送上來，情緒會感到非常的興憤。下船坐着看波濤，水流很急，造錢江大橋放下去的沉箱，重達五百噸，竟被冲走，可惜它流人杭州灣口，有鼈子門的阻碍，由海入江，祇通帆船，不通海輪。錢江大橋工程處，距渡口十里，看不見什麼，金橋竣工期，大槪順在後年。後登江東的那個碼頭，是木樑造的，露着天，恰巧下雨，一個個抱頭而奔，難道這就是浙東比浙西苦的象徵麼？奔到車站，空氣却很沉默，月台上堆着許多待運的怪物，有的竟被留商着，發出浙瀝浙瀝的嘆聲，好像在訴說：我們天生一副銅筋鐵肋，具有轟天震地的威力，但是不得飢餐胡虜肉，渴飲匈奴血，而今又要「那個」了！奈何奈何？</p>
<p>浙贛全路的通車，雖才半年多，（杭江段通車在二十三年），職工人員的待遇，僅及其他各路的一半，可是他把辦事人員的整飭精神，大體上都很難得。由杭州赴南昌，需時二十四小時，三等車入夜還賣臥舖，上舖一元，下舖元半，還算便宜。其他先進各鐵路，往往長行兩晝夜以上，只賣頭二等臥舖，似應屈尊一效後起之秀的浙贛路，對三等乘客做做好事。實際上，各路客車的營業收入，通常是■等優於頭二等的。而坐頭二等的人，有時還多是免票或半票，甚至開着冷靜靜的空車。三等乘客，則常有人滿之患，替他想想個經濟舒適的辦法，也是情理中事。又該路玉甫段工程的設計，旣不借才於外國，各種建築，也未乞憐於洋商，所用材料，更盡可能的採用國貨，居然得此良好的成績。此外錢塘江橋工程處，以這决橋工工程的鉅大，技術的新頴，特招請各大學土木工程系畢業生，到工程處實習，並已有二十人升充練習工務員，另外還有八九十人的長期實習生，成績都斐然可觀，這都是可以增加國人有爲的自信心，而中國人才的出路，也將逐漸放出曙光。</p>
<p>鐘聲數響，氣笛一鳴，火車蠕蠕發動，天公也展開笑顏。一會兒到蕭山，它的城牆，半部建於平地，半部爬在山上，到有幾分像萬里長城。城西南五六里，有一周的卅里的湘湖，是宋楊龜山，爲興水利，而廢農田築成的。湖作葫蘆形，四圍多山，湖心有花塢橋，類似故都萬壽山的玉帶橋。湖中還產蒓菜，土步魚，味很鮮美。這時正逢農人「纔了蠶葉叉揷田」的季節，所以鐵路近畔的水田，有的揷秧已發綠了，有的還正忙着揷秧，淸陳葵有詞云，「分秧分秧須及時，低田先揷高田遲，轉眼西風稻花放，黃雲萬頃堆茅茨」。這是多麼的快樂啊？然而原因是在於同詞「年來歲熟官租賤」。和「催租無吏人不驚「的前數句，現在赤日下揷秧的農夫，恐未必有那樣的寫意吧！</p>

<p>通俗講座傳靑主  張兆瑞　　　明朝末年的朝廷，只聽信宦官，因而宦官專權，操縱國家大事。假造聖旨，植黨營私，誰肯奉承他們，巴結他們，誰就能做大官，能享厚祿。請想：一般利祿薰心的人們，誰不奉承他們呢？至於不對他們眼的人，任憑怎樣忠直，怎麼廉潔，官也做不成，甚至性命都保不住，那些無恥下流的士大夫們，爲圖高官厚祿，竟有給宦官當義子的，這使宦官對那些忠直的官員，更看同眼中釘，所以用了種種毒辣的手段，一個個的陷害了。國家的大權，旣落在他們黨徒手裏任意橫行，如狼似虎，百姓怨恨非常，不敢奈何他們；而民心因此大失，造成變亂的因素，以致弄得國家到不堪收拾的地步。　　崇禎七八年間，山西提學袁繼咸，因爲不善巴結宦官，就被他們的同黨巡按使張孫振奏他貪贓枉法，朝廷信以爲眞，把袁提學下了獄。袁繼咸本是個廉潔的官，人民沒有不愛戴他的。當時，山西人聽了消息之後，莫不替袁提學呌寃；，但都怕張孫振的權勢大，不敢伸訴，不過暗中憤恨罷了。　　陽曲地方，有位讀書人，姓傅名山字呌靑主的，家在山西中部，幾世以來道德學問都有聲望。這位傅山先生小時，不愛說話，讀書記憶力很好；趕到少年時，天下已經不安，賊寇遍地，張獻忠李自成擾亂南北各省，當時一般號稱縉紳先生的，多半貪生怕死，卑鄙齷齪，遇賊到時，就去歡迎，以求不死，從未見有人出來圖謀抵抗的，因此流寇肆行無忌，所到地方，焚殺搶掠，姦淫婦女，人民受盡百般痛苦，這位先生看見這種情况，心中就常想，怎樣挽救這國家的危難。　　這時，傅山先生聽到袁提學被下了獄的消息，一時氣得兩眼直瞪，大聲嘆道：「天下還有這等事嗎！？這樣的官，也要下獄，簡直………。」當下就去的了他的同學名呌曹良直的，二人趕進京城來，上書御史台，陳述袁提學的淸白，連上書三决，也未見生效；後來得知所上的書，都被張孫振扣住，不能到達朝廷前，便和曹良直毅然不顧一切的直跑到宮鬥上，跪在地下，大聲替袁提學喊寃，才把袁繼咸的淸白，給朝廷聽見；可巧，那時山西巡撫吳姓，也奏陳玄提學的忠直，朝廷才眞正的明白實情了，把袁繼咸從獄中放出，恢復了原舊的官職。因此。傅山先生不怕暴力的聲譽，傳遍各地。　　不多時，曹良直做了兵科給事的官，傅山先生寄書給曹良直道：「足下現今做給事，應當辦理天下第一件大事，給大衆除害，才不辜負舊朋友的希望，……。」良直讀後大大的感動，猛然覺醒，便不顧一切的大罪，　着膽子，彈劾害國害民的大臣，周延儒十六條大罪，朝廷雖很寵信延儒，但被曹良直這一揭穿，也無法掩飾只得賜周延儒死了。還有一個錦衣衛的員司，名呌駱養性，爲人狡猾不過，初本是周延儒把他薦舉出來的；平時仗周延儒的勢力，貪汚橫行；後來反想奪周延儒的位，勾結衆官，要陷害周延儒曹良直旣被傅先生提醒，遂就把駱養性也一併彈劾了。一時人們的怨氣大出，你傳給我；我傳給他的把這事的直詳情傳開了，　都知道曹良爲國除害，是傅山先生鼓動起來的，因而傅山先生正直的聲名，更轟動了全國。　　崇禎十七年，李自成進北京，皇帝吊死煤山上，吳三桂引淸兵入關，打進北京城；當時所謂士大夫們，儘先投降，沒有一人爲國家想抵抗挽救辦法，所以沒多時，淸兵就把半壁河山，亳不費力的佔有了。　　人們都見明朝大勢已去，就溫順的給滿淸當順民稱臣了？傅山先生在這種情形下，眼看大明天下是完了，人心是死了，氣得先生瘋瘋癲癲不知怎樣才好，便自此和外間的人，都斷絕往來，隱居在土穴裏。因不甘做亡國奴，便自稱道人，成日鑽在土穴裹，研究歷代忠臣義士，救國的事實，救國的方法。　　一般忠直的明朝遺臣，雖不能把國家挽救起來，但也不像那般無恥的士大夫們，給外族稱臣，做走狗，很有人做出幾决轟轟烈烈的反抗，只是力小勢薄，都被滿淸給平壓了，有些人總算以身報國了。　　順治初年，到處搜捕明朝遺臣，恐怕他們死灰復燃，起來做反淸運動。傅山先生與一些以身殉國的忠臣們，交處甚厚，所以這時連帶的追究到先生，便把先生下了獄，拿死刑來逼迫，要先生聲明願尊淸朝，當個順民；先生那裏屆服，奮力抗辯，氣得一連九天不進飲食，眼看就要死去了，先生的門人弟子們，急得什麼似的，施了個奇計，才營救出來。　　先生被釋放出來，弟子們喜得發狂，先生反比在獄中懊惱的厲害，怒恨恨的嘆道；「這個世界，我死了豈不痛快些，還救什麼哩！貓兒狗兒都不吃外人的食，天下竟成了人家的，我還有甚麼顏面活下去呢？咱不能像文天祥等先烈們，替國效力，也得……。」氣得長吁短嘆，指天畫地，簡直是瘋了。從此以後，他就這樣瘋瘋癲癲，竟有二十多年，沒有一天快活過。　　後來天下大定，全國人都做了滿淸的順民，先生知道明朝的天下，再沒法挽救了！自己無法伸展志願，便戴着頂黃道帽，算是出了家，權當不是同一世上的人，聊以安慰熱辣辣的心情。久之，漸漸的走出土穴來，與那些忠直有道之士，談論談論；到後來，常去附近各處，給人治病，一般人當眞只以他是個甚麼道人，誰也認不出是有名的傅山先生。　　康熙初年，滿淸企圖用籠絡的方法來消滅明末遺民的反抗思想，便徵求遺老，詔京內外長官，各舉出「博學弘儒」，來應博學鴻詞科的考試，考後給官職；給事中李宗孔劉沛二人，欽佩先生的學問道德，就把先生給薦舉出來。這時，先生已經七十叫歲了。趕到劉沛吿知此種消息，要請先生去應試，先生堅决拒絕，而劉沛又不允許，先生被纏得沒法，就裝病來拒絕。劉沛見光生的直氣，是不能說服的，就使差役們舁着先生床走，先生年老，抵擋不住，遂就被舁着走，兩個孫子，跟着侍候。　　一趕走到離京城三十里的地方，在城西的一個古寺內歇息着，先生知再一走，就要進城了，淸白的心志，是要被屈辱了。正當他們動身舁着進城的時候，先生便怒咜道：「你們這些人，再要舁我進城，我老命就要在此拚了！」說着，就用頭碰床，大家忙上前來攔阻，一壁勸解，先生那裹肯依，和攔阻的人揪撤拚命，衆人恐怕眞的氣死先生，到底沒敢舁進城去。　　這時，城中的士大夫們，聽得先生來了，都忙出城來迎接；先生因他們喪盡了廉恥，向韃子稱臣，連話也不願和他們說，聽他們自來自去。迎送禮都沒有。他始終不肯進城。弄得衆人想不出個法來，有個蔚州人魏尚書象樞，見這種光景，深深感動先生的節烈，恐屈了先生的義氣，便奏陳康熙，說先生因老病不能應試，才算了結了這樁公案。　　沒多時，滿淸爲了想用種種方法，來消滅漢人的反淸思想，便又微求年老有聲望的人恩賜官銜，山東的馮溥，又給先生秘密請求了，滿淸朝廷立卽允准，賜官爲中書舍人，以示恭敬的意思。馮溥領了滿淸的聖旨，就去陽曲拜訪光生，一見面就說：「老伯大喜……」先生嘆道：「亡國之人，還有甚麼可喜哩！」馮溥忙道：「朝廷因晚生之請，恩賜老伯爲中書舍人哩！」先生一聽，當下卽一沉面色，兩眼放出惱怒的光芒來。馮溥道：「老伯別太執拗了，人家朝廷還尊重你，破格給你官職，你也得進去謝謝……」先生怒道：「你自己寡廉鮮恥，不顧節義，貪圖作官，難道要我也無恥嗎？」接着又說：「我堂堂大明皇帝子孫。也要給夷狄稱臣做相，我沒臉對祖先，我至死也不能從命！」馮溥知道自己說也無效，就託了許多先生的親戚朋友和親近人來勸說，求他勉强進京謝一謝，先生見大衆又來要挾，只得拿病勢危急來應付。馮溥知道勸說又是不能說服的，只好照舊　着床進京，衆人　先加防備，安排妥當，使先生不能大大活動，先生雖百般的拒絕，衆人也要舁走。趕到進了京城，望見午門，先生不禁眼淚汪汪，豆大的淚珠，直滾下來，馮溥要摻先生下床朝拜，先生兩手據床，堅持不肯，馮溥用力拉，先生支不住，跌倒地上，蔚州魏尚書看見，連忙上前說道：「快罷了！快罷了！道就算謝啦！」衆人才把先生扶上床，舁出宮來。　　第二天，就要回家，大學士以下的官員們，都出城來送。先生對送的人嘆道：「從今回去，可饒了我吧！怎麼也不會再有醜事發生了吧？接着又說：「若後人以我和劉因——隱居不做官——輩相比，我就是死後，也合不上眼哪！」先生的意思是說：我並不是不做官，我要做祖國的官，恢復漢人的天下，才是我的心願呢！衆人聽了，都目呆舌咋，說不出話來。　　他到死的時候，仍舊穿着那紫道袍？戴着那黃道帽。馬可尼Gulielmo　Marconi  張樹英　　　—無線電發明家—　　馬可尼於一八七四年四月廿五日生於意大利之波洛尼亞，父爲意大利人，母爲英吉利人。當一八八六年，德國的科學家赫芝（HeinrichHertz(1857——1894）實騐電波時，馬可尼雖僅士二歲，然對此新發明已感着莫大的興趣，於是就在意大利有名的科學家賴特（AugvstaRight1850-1920)敎授之下開始研究。賴特敎授對於赫芝所證實的電波，特別有心得，馬可尼得此良師，進步更快，他時常想：「不能利用電波發明無綫電嗎？」馬可尼不惟自已這樣想，還希望共他科學家，能有更新的發明，然而當時的學者們，沒有人敢夢想應用赫芝所證明的電波，進而發明「無綫電通信」的事業，馬可尼便下决心决定自己來完成這個任務。　　電波與光同樣的速度，經大洋越大海，爲人們作通信之用，也許是夢想罷！然而少年馬可尼，終於異想天開的，决爲實現此目的而奮鬥，馬可尼經過許多思索後，在自己的庭園裏，樹立長竿，繫以錫板爲空中綫，再在發信空中綫之一尖端繫以有銹導性的電圈，另一尖端則揷於地上。這個分別天地綫的新創作，就是他發明成功的起源。這樣的裝置，可使發振機發放電波的能力，增於加數倍，馬氏利用每個火花的間隙與高周波綫輪，連結受信空中錢中，不久便完成其距離數百尺間通信的收發。再四實騐之後，於一八九五年發明無綫電通信，當時馬可尼年僅廿二歲，尚肄業於波洛尼亞大學。同時他明白裝置無綫電最重要的問題，就是受信器，於是便開始改良布蘭林。（E．Blanly)檢波器，以代替赫芝的高周波綫輪。他以銀質填入小管再以鉛與銀的合金填入同管中，更在回路中將空中綫與電池相接續，同時加裝自動檢波器，由發信所發出的電波，使共先在空中綫中停止，然後經過檢波器，再傳於地，受信器於是便得一步前進。　　無論那個科學家，他偉大事業的成功，並不是單靠一個人的力量，而是賴許多先驅之努力，馬可尼發明無錢電，也不是例外。在馬可尼以前，早有許多人研究利用電爲通信工具，要是沒有前成功人之努力，也許馬可尼的不致如此迅速。對於無綫電最有功勞的，第一當推模斯(Sam　　lMore1791-1872)他於一八四二年發明電信機；第二位是裴耳（Graham　Bell　1847-1922，他於一八七五年發明電話機：馬可尼的無錢電受話機，就是應川這電話機製成的。第三位是特洛布立沿（John　Trowbri　ge1843-）敎授，他實騐交流記號通過地上，山於電話回路的尖端接於地上而得受信，並且實騐過距離甚短的，從某電圈送電波於其他電圈，亦吿成功。其他如愛迪生（Thoma．A　Edison　1847－1931)在疾走的火車上繫以短的空巾綫，利用此綫發出電波，能與附近的電話綫相接，再傳達符號一於沿鐵道各車站，因而得到種無綫電話的專利特權。英國物理學家馬克士威（Tames　Clerh　Maxwell　18311834)從數學上證明光是「以太」中電磁的振動，電波的名字就是他預言的，後來經赫芝的實騐而得證明。馬可尼得到這些先驅者努力的結晶，再加自己的努力，始開發明無錢電的門徑。　　馬可尼發明無綫電後，曾作種種以及遠近的實騐。一九〇一年十二月上旬，馬氏經大西洋而抵紐芬蘭，在紐芬蘭住了一週，與其助手放上幾個大風箏作引電的實騐，但結局毫無反應，後來有一决的風箏，竟達四百呎高，風箏綫繫於地面柱上，通過窟葉？而達自己居住的二樓，這就是空中綫與地下錢的受話機簡單連絡的搆造。　　馬可尼曾在英國孔威爾海濱鮑爾頓地方建立有强力的無綫電發信所。在他起程來紐芬蘭的時候，會囑其技師，每日由電波發生器中發出『S』的信號，該技帥承囑後，便不斷向高二百吹的空中發出『S』的電波，所以馬可尼在紐芬蘭，不斷的緊握受話機於耳，再三試騐，有一天突然接連發生三聲「滴達」的聲音，這就是S符號，馬可尼當時喜出望外，果然如他所料，電波能與光音的速度般渡過大西洋而傳達至自己的受話機裏，此爲電波渡過大西洋之第一决。　　馬可尼後來更發見空中錢愈高，而發信受信的範圍則愈廣，經過兩年的實騐，通信之距離，居然能擴大至數哩之遠，後來他至英國，得普利斯爵士格外優待和讚助，竟能在倫教郵局作無綫電的裝置。回國後叉得意政府給以使用軍艦之便，在距離甚遠的海岸上作無綫電通信的實騐，拘獲極大成功。一八九九年馬可尼從一百五十呎的空中綫，完成劃時代的英海峽的通信　　無綫電不僅能報吿各地的消息，至於海洋上的危難，得其通達，救援尤便。到了一九〇〇年，歐洲各國，　乎沒有不裝置無綫電的。一九〇一年隔太商津與美口　通信，亦吿成　　　　　　電已進入新的發展階段。英國海軍不惜以十萬金購貿無綫電　　　軍艦上，不久其他各國海軍亦繼續裝置，就是商業方面，亦爭先恐後的利用，無綫電於是漸成爲人類生活上不可少的東西。　　馬氏發明無綫電的成功，至此已達極點，然他仍不斷的努力研究，希望無綫電能得更進步的發展，火星上是　　　　　　生存，這是很早就成爲天文學界不能解决的問題，爲要證明這問題是否屬實，許多學者便想和火星通信，馬可尼就是實行和火星通信的第一個人。他也曾用强力的無綫電向火星拍出，雖結果全無響應，但以後如有更强力的電波，也許可以到達彼方，而得確切的答覆。　　淨來斯特(DeForest(1873－）發明三種眞空管後，收音機更得飛躍的發展，時至今日，收音機之被人們樂用，已不亞於電話機的普遍，無綫電的通信事業也跟着飛進，一秒間可走三億米突的電波，把地球上的距離縮至零點，這全靠無綫電的功用，才有這驚人的成績。然而這無綫電時代的出現，我們决不能忘記這位偉大的發明者馬可尼。出版界關於政治方面出版物的檢視  莊心在　　　「僑聞學而後人政，未聞以政學者也」。鄭子產的話，實在是含有至理。近來政治兩字的意議，被重新估定爲「管理衆人之事，」而衆人之事，却隨着社會的進化，而日益趨於專門化，因此政治更加上一層科學的意義，需要着富有專門學術敎養的人才來掌理，而不是不學無術的人所可以隨便操觚濫竽的。　　中國過去的學術文化史上，本來是以哲學與政治學的發達著稱，日本關田榮吉，在文化社會學中明白地說：「中國的學問，不外政治之術，處世之法的學問而已」歷來孔孟以降，人才輩出。，也不少規模宏大的政治學者。可是近世以來，政治學術，日見銷沉，不是摭拾先人餘緒，低徊往古，津津樂道；便是呑剝歐美皮毛，侈談外國，備致欽羨。很少有宏深博大，根固葉茂卓然成家者，發爲著述，自更談不到能對症發藥，切適時勢，有裨於國政的了。中國近年來以經濟政治之决殖民地化，而使學術文化陷於頹唐衰微之境，其間允以政治學方面爲允甚，外人每謂「近世中國僅有政客而無政治家（Statesman），更無政治學者(Politiclan）。」言雖近議，實非過甚。　　中國政治學的衰頹，很可以從出版上覘其端倪。民國十八年以後社會科學出版物代新文藝而興，盛極一時，其中屬於社會學者多，經濟學者决之，法律學又决之，屬於政治學者甚寥寥，其後國際經濟危潮澎湃，中國經濟方面出版物乃如雨後春笋，駕社會學而上之。但政治方面的出版品，爲數依然很微。至今如想要找一本比較完善的大綱入門書，亦不易得。卽爲一般所採用的王世杰）編比較憲法，（商務印書館版，）實在也只是比較的取材宏，觀點正，編制妥而已。自噲以下，更無足論。記得有一次因有所參考，偶栓張慰慈敎授的政治制度淺說（神州國肖社版）地方政府章，全章文句，似曾相識，後重讀Willoughby　and　Rogers的Introduction　tothe　Problen　of　Goverament，乃知全章均係抄譯而來，但該書版權頁上寫明「著作者張慰慈，」書中更沒有會參考何書之類的附注表明，張慰慈在中國也算是政治學者的前輩，其他所謂編著，荒唐舛謬，自更不必　　所以我總是認爲　　　　科學最好的辦法，一方面應該研究中國史實和前代名人（如王安石王宗義等）文集，一方面直接多讀些外國名家的著述。如或不能，還是讀些名著中文譯本，例如孫寒氷譯Garner著的Political　Science　and　Government，張士林譯Laski著的Grammar　of　Politics，陶希聖譯Oppenheimer著的The　State之類，都是政治學上必讀的要籍，而譯筆也還鄭重，比之讀一些東鱗西瓜，七拚八凑，生吞活剝的所謂編著，總該要有意義得多。（未完）「太平天國詩文鈔」  丁諦　　羅邑　沈祖基同輯　商務印書館出版　　太平天國的出現可以說是有消一代一個重耍的民族運動，雖然牠的結果終不免於失收，但是牠的典章文物，却也有過相當的輝耀。依曾國藩們的眼光看來，太平天國自然是妖魔魑魅，在一班腐敗頑固的傳統文字上，也仍然可以看到「赭寇」「髮匪」一類的字樣，可是我們現在的人站在民族運動的立塲上，對於太平天國的認識，自然是絕對的相反了。我們爲了過去的烈士的光輝的戰蹟，我們應該追念，迥溯，憑吊！我們滿着悲哀，但很有興味地檢視天國的十餘年的歷史。不管是一粒微細的砂子，也有人高興把牠當做實石一樣看待。　　我知道有許許多多的人都曾經下過一番苦心，搜集天國時代的殘篇斷簡，書坊裹有不少「野史」「雜乘」「史料」「筆記」等等的書籍，可是我覺得比較能表達天國的革命精神的，還要推薦「太平天國詩文鈔」道一部書。　　第一，因爲許多「野史」之類的書還脫不了雜摭舊聞。自然舊聞裹面也有些很重要的太平天國的文件，卽如詩文鈔裏面也就引用了不少，不過牠們的主耍目標决不是像這部書專門搜集太平天國的詩文，而是以史實爲主，間有詩文雜入。正因爲這樣，以史實爲主的「野史」之類，只好說供給編史的史料，至於說到比較能紀念當時革命的精神和情緒，實在沒有這一部詩文鈔來得有力。　　第二，這部詩文鈔固然可以表達天國的革命情緒，同時在文鈔的一部分裏面也供給我們不少的珍貴的文獻。我可以說：以往的太平天國的著作，都沒有這部書來得完備。換句話說：這是一部搜輯太平天國的文件比較豐富的書。卽如「太平天國王候封號名表」，大體雖以凌善淸的「太平天國野史」爲藍本，實際上他已經增補了一倍以上的封號，這不可以說不是編者的艱苦的功力。　　第三，我們從這部書上找不出苟且的地方。像太平天國這十數年的命運，旣乏國史，官書亦多不詳，材料的來源是眞是假，都有賴於細心的甄別。而道部書的作者對於這些地方都頗能認眞，凡是絕對的失眞的材料固然不讓牠來濫竽充數，卽是眞假難定的，也都把題目低列一格，以示區別。絕對失真的例如坊間通行的「石達開日記」及「石遠開詩鈔」的一部均在割　之列，後例如異王的「報天王書」「復曾國藩書」等，均爲籎似之作。　　第四，在每一篇詩文的上首，作者先將有關於這篇詩文的史實以及原著人的略史表明，這樣讀者看到該篇文字時庶幾不致茫無頭緒。例如專善祥的「上東王書」，他得吿訴我們傅善祥是一個什麼人，她是爲什麼上這道奏書的。假使我們不曉得她是一個女狀元，以及她是怎樣爲東王所寵，寵而復貶，貶而再幸，我們便無從知道這篇「上東王書」的前因後果了。　　上面隨意舉出的幾點，一大半以上是作者再版後改正，這一點我很欽佩作者的虛懷若谷的精神。老實說：假使像初版時那樣的面目的話，讀者是不能認爲滿意的　　由於我讀後的良好的印象，我願意很熱心地來推薦這部書給廣大的讀者。介紹一部「中國修辭學」（續完）  鍾怡　　　然而，遠在將近千年以前的中國，關於修辭方面，能有這樣縝密的分析，也不可不謂爲一大成功。所以四庫全書總目提要上又說：然取格法於聖經，終勝摹機調於後人；其所標舉，神而明之，存乎其人，固不必以定法病此書也。　　這話實在不錯。　　叉修辭學方面，有一種階升法，又叫漸層法（Climz)。譬如孟子上的「天時不如地利，地利不如人和。」荘子上的「　憐蚿。虵，虵憐目，目憐風，風憐心。」都是。可是這種方法，陳在「文則」的丁編上，早已說過：　　文有上下相接，若繼踵然。　　他又把這分做三類：　　其一曰，叙積小至大。　　幷且舉「能盡其性，則能盡人之性；能盡人之性，則能盡物之性；能盡物之性，則能贊天地之化育，與天地叅矣（中庸）做例子。　　其二曰，由精及粗。　　幷且舉「古之明大道者，先明天，而道德决之；道德已明，而仁義决之；仁義已明，而分守决之；　守己明，而形名次之…」（莊子）做例子。　　其三曰，自流及源。　　幷且舉「古之欲明明德於大下者，必先治其國；欲治其國者，必先　共家；欲齊其家者，必先修共身；欲修其身者…」（大學）做例子。　　他這種詳細的分類，眞是再好沒有了。因爲修辭學是一種文學上的工具，也可以說是用科學方法來說明文章的結構的；所以在這一方面，個人覺得應當不厭其詳，分門別類；否則，空空洞洞，說幾句不關痛癢的話，又何能算是文則　！　　這部書，卷數不多，而內容頗好；在這翻印古書風氣最盛行的時代，個人極願出版界能够杷他印出單行本來，庶幾乎這位批評家的著作，可以永垂不朽；個人謹以至誠，向讀者諸君作一個介紹。</p>

<p>康健之路肺病及其他呼吸器病  鄧源和醫師　　肺結核我國俗稱癆瘵，簡稱肺病，其原因由於結核菌自呼吸氣管侵入肺臟，或食物附著結核菌進入胃腸，吸收至肝臟，轉輸入肺，若肺部潛留結核菌，則於該處發生一小結節，若身體抵抗力增加，此結節之周圍，必裹有結締組織，使不致蔓延為患，至體力衰弱時，則結締組織之隄防不固，而病勢乃大發矣。　　本病之誘因亦多起於感胃，因輕度之發熱，持績之咳嗽，伴發肺尖加答兒症，即為第一期肺病。　　若不致發生肺病，而因久咳不愈，則往往發生慢性氣管炎，氣管枝擴張症，甚至喀出腐敗性之膿痰，成為腐敗性氣管枝加答兒。又困氣管枝痙　而來喘息症。　　患有肺病者，多數併發其他呼吸病，如肋膜炎之胸痛，氣管炎之咳嗽，氣管擴張之多痰症等等，故藥治之道，須面面顧到，普通製劑，治其他呼吸器病者，則不能防漢癆患，而治凍害者亦然。惟據多數專家實騐，以「補肺拿爾」一藥，有補肺清痰，消炎鎭咳之功，實玲瓏剔透，療治一切肺疾患之要藥，其性質王道，又無流弊，對於喀知喀痰，咳嗽食減，胸痛盜汗，潮熱瘦之肺癆，及傷風久咳，老年哮喘，小兒百日咳等症，奏效確實。而有增進食慾，改善營養，以減縮治愈時日之偉力。惟最好有癆症之患者與「補體康」同時進服（「女用補女容」）又「補肺拿爾」含有蛋黃素及維他命等品，用為煙民之戒癮療咳，尤為吻合。其補力直　魚肝油之上，而天熱亦無膩滯之病云。色素劑治淋之價值  陳少華醫師　　淋病之色素製劑，以消炎殺菌等目的，廣為提供於治療界者也，其治療之價值，已為周知之事實，然而其副作用，亦甚強大，若貿然施以此劑，卽訴惡心，嘔吐，顏面蒼白等，故醫家與病家，每不敢大胆施用。　　自布羅寗瓜，希魯莫兒氏之動物試騐，及臨床應用後，色素係因精神之提煉，大加改良，現已完全不認副作用，久已作一般淋菌性疾患之治療劑，而奏卓越的效果。但欲調劑靜脈內注射液時，稍以不愼，其效力則大為減弱，此乃一般醫家頗感不便之處。　　其後學者乃創為內服製劑，然因配合未純，提製未精，仍不免有過峻過緩之流弊。此今日市上淋藥雖多，而服者每有難於選擇之苦也。自愛爾利希氏之研究後，於是其高足彼得氏乃以最科學之方法，將色素嚴密提凈，而驅淋聖藥「克淋儂」遂告發明成功矣。其治男女之急慢性白濁，及淋濁性關節炎，男子之攝護腺，　丸，膀胱等炎症，婦女子陰門，　道，子宮淋等，皆有至上之確效，而毫無任何刺激，並不敗胃。此　學者證明，諸家報告甚多，不遑枚舉，故近來已目為一切尿道傳染疾患之特效藥。惟購了切勿輕信他人言而誤購雜牌廉價劣藥，致服務引起性命之憂！故宜認清眞正「克淋儂」三字為要。文明之罪惡  陳少華醫師　　神經衰弱之兩性患者　　兩性之神經衰弱，至近世而益滸，蓋處今日文化極為發達之世，四周不良之引誘甚多，故青年男女羅自　惡癖者，幾十之八九，而早婚房事過度，斷喪內分泌機能者，尤屢見不鮮。患者如頭目眩暈，心悸失眠，記憶力弱，思想滯鈍。體格矮小，或萎黃而消瘦，男子則下部發育不全，艷夢頻發，致遺洩之次數甚密，甚或日間偶有刺戟，亦有泌出精液者。而女性則患月經困難，白帶下注，乳房臀部，均平坦而缺乏女性之發育。因此對於生育亦發生問題。是誠文明之罪惡也。　　此病之原因，旣在內分泌，故近頃學者研究贓器療法。其中以梅倫氏所發明之男用「補體康」，女用「補女容」二藥功效最著。此二藥係梅倫氏畢生心血之結晶，其原料採自勇壯動物之睪丸及卵巢之荷爾蒙，用科學方法分別製成，凡男女兩性患前述各症，均能於短期內治愈，因男女服用「補體康」「補女容」後，卽可旺盛內分泌機能，使全身有充分之內分泌，而新鮮血液亦可源源而生，故性系組織，遂得強化，一切性神經衰弱，均可獲愈。男子有魁梧之偉丈夫面目，女子則有細膩嬌艷之時代健壯典健，是又科學上之新發現也。歐美諸邦仕女，莫不爭相購服，固不僅有却病之功，亦富有駐春之效也。白帶病與月經  戴德醫師　　白帶病與月經，在表面上似無關係，而其實際上，正有相互之關係，例如一個月經失調之女子，其白帶病亦非常之重，反之有白帶病者，亦十九患月經不調症。此因白帶病恒有誘起月經不調故也。患者面色萎黃，兩目塗濃厚之眼圈。下部浸潤，糜爛，黃白色之膿液，涓涓從腔道而出，致衣褲沾汚，月經不調小便不暢，以致小腹亦有膨脹不堪，每次小便，則又刺痛，婦女因畏羞之故恒秘不肯語人，遂忍痛終年，竟至不服喪，畢生幸福，於焉斷喪。　　治療此疾，從前尚無特效藥，自有「卡而雪地氏陰道片」。發明以來，此白帶病已無足恐。因此藥善能收殮分泌液，且有在局部喰菌之效能。凡不論新舊遠的白帶，用後於數星期內，卽可奏效。局部乾潔如處女。惟由體虛而來者，可兼服「補女容」，因丈夫傳染淋毒而來者，可兼服「克淋　」，則充為根本之療法也。夏令可厭的腸胃病  陳少華醫師　　在夏令因體力易於勞倦，胃腸之機能亦較平日衰減，食物倘不細嚼，或竟暴飲暴食，恣啖生冷，又不幸福誤食腐敗，或經蒼蠅吮吸之物，將病菌吞入體內，胃腸之機能，無有不受賊害，而起劇烈之病變者。於是嘔吐噯酸，口臭發勢，全身倦怠，下痢腹痛。或腸鳴而洩出薄粥狀之水糞。其下疾有日行二三回至三四十回者。　　此症為腸胃之內容物酸酵所致，其胃粘膜業已受傷，腸之蠕動亢進，若不速治，每釀成赤痢症，其變為慢性胃腸病者，多致於營養不良，而成惡性貧血。　　治療之法，須身體安靜，腹部略帶溫暖，食以流動性之食物，內部之酸酵食物，急令排出之，勿使留滯，故服藥宜消導與防腐兼施。「強胃精」之功效，以其係複方酵酸劑，有弭止胃腸粘膜刺激，糾正腸蠕進等殊效。故為一種輔助消化之緩下劑，夏令腸胃病服之，奏騐奇速，且藥性純良，無任何刺激，並富含A·B·D·三種貴重之生活素及蛋黃素，為久病不復原，因缺乏生活素B·之脚氣症，煙民胃呆便秘及戒煙之良藥。其治慢性胃腸病之嘈雜胸悶，噯氣吞酸，嘔吐惡心，得食則脹，胃部與腹部隱隱作痛，以及大便秘結，腸鳴腹瀉，虛人大便糖薄等，奏效之妥速，遠出醫家想像之上云。鄧源和醫師肺病瑣談　　診址：四川路寗波路口。診時：下午四至六時。　　夏日之肺癆病　　際茲長夏天氣，　暑蒸人，體健者猶時覺困乏致病，乃素有肺病者，每至夏日，益覺困頓不支，故四季之肺病死亡率，亦以夏季為最高，良有以也。患者每覺體倦萎頓，食慾銳減，胸膈窒悶，喘促氣短，精神恍惚，至此肺組織有加速崩潰之勢，咳痰喀血，兩顴作緋赤色，望之如塗丹，入夜則盜汗失眠等交互而來，體益不支，往往因此而致命。　　關於此項症狀之挽救，若病態進行未于十分險境，則「補肺拿爾」一藥。功效至捷，且可預防惡化，最宜服用，凡肺病患者，一臨夏日，如覺體氣困乏，病勢有增加之勢，急須靜養，多攝有滋養料之食品，一方進服「補肺拿爾」以增強體內抗抵力，而產生白血球，以撲滅結核菌，則不但病勢可以遏制進行，且可由此而治愈之。若同時更有神經衰弱，遺精失眠等症，可兼服「補體康」，女子有閉不潮，身體　瘦者，可兼服「補女容」依此治療，則腦力體力，俱可陡增，奏效尤速也。遺精病之治療  戴德醫師　　遺精為近世人類難免之病，實亡國病之一，患者體力衰弱，眩暈健忘，判斷力銳減，作事無恒心，若延久不愈，則多致悲觀苦悶，引起自殺之念。　　對於本病之治療，歷來製劑雖多，然不過徒尚堵塞，縱使見效一時，終無確效也。耐氏「育精片」專治遺精不論每週數次，或二便及用力時滑精，日間漏精等，並因遺精而來之衰弱眩暈等症，因增強意志，故手淫之惡癖可以戒除。藥性和平，為調整性能之根治遺精品。「克淋儂」實騐一束　　睪丸腫痛　　患者孫大元君，自罹淋病，旣未根治，性又喜乘車騎馬等戶外運動，致突變為睪丸炎，右側睪丸腫痛，不良於行，尿線細小，淋系極多，且於尿後見紅，迭經治療，而功效全無，嗣經戴德醫師治療，見其睪丸腫大，且有硬化趨，乃屬其絕對安靜，一方進服「克淋儂」，以殺菌消炎，鎭痛利尿，連服三四星期後，睪丸痛楚大減，排尿暢利，惟偶然於尿中尚有淋系，仍繼服十餘天，始克根治。至今飲酒勞動，迄無病的變動云　　夫妻淋病　　患者唐又明君，患淋病迄已二年，曾一度治愈，但困淋毒已傳染其夫人，故未幾復發，小便艱難，肛門脹痛，時有精液狀物，從尿道口泌出，嗣經姚菊嚴醫診療，知已成慢性攝護腺炎，除行按摩電療法後，更囑服「克淋儂」，經數星期之治療，卽告治愈，同時其夫人之淋毒性白帶，亦服「克淋儂」，外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，亦於三四星期中獲愈。夫婦偕居迄今未嘗復發，且舉一女一男矣。　　關節炎腫　　患者姜洪君，染淋多載，不愼攝生，嗜好煙酒，致淋濁纏綿，時愈時發。後因過度勞動，釀成關節炎，四肢骨節作痛，難以轉側，行動殊苦，且尿液混濁，少腹膨脹，經戴醫師診治，囑服「克淋儂」約四瓶，炎腫卽消，轉動自如，續服四瓶，，淋濁清瘳，健步如飛矣。　　濃汁交流　　患者謝畊虞君，年二十七。於前月上旬忽染淋病，當時尿道口有豐富之膿液。數日後，龜頭紅腫，包皮翻轉，小便困難，莖中瘙癢刺痛，有如蟻　狀。小便並夾血絲，服藥略愈，但經一星期又生復增劇。經陳少華醫師介紹，服「克淋儂」約三瓶，淋濁卽減，痛癢亦正，繼服二瓶餘，卽告根治，經消息子刺激，確證斷根云。　　老淋遺精　　患者范有廣君，年三十八。於九年前曾患淋病，中經調治，迭愈迭發，身體困難異常，遺精帶血。每晨淋濁封口，遇勞動則濁絮如注。經鄭源和醫師示服「克淋儂」以除淋，並同時服「補體康」以旺盛體力，而治遺精，為期五星期，卽臻根治，今二年未發，精神日增云。　　小便頻數　　患者吳雅非君，曾沾淋病，嗣轉為後尿道炎，小便淋瀝不清，濁絮每晨封口，排尿日二十餘次，痛苦萬狀，經陳少華醫師斷為膀胱炎，示服「克淋儂」三瓶，小便卽利，痛苦若失，卽續服數週，遂獲根治云。　　讀者如有疑難各病，可附足回信郵票，直寄上海武定路八六九號康健醫藥社，即可照覆姚菊巖醫師淋病講座　　診所：四川路寗波路轉角　診時：上午十時至下午六時。　　淋毒性關節炎之新療法　　許多失治之淋病，恒易發生關節炎，考此症之成因，淋毒旣未肅清，而又行飲酒。勞動，房事等項之刺　，使淋菌乘此等刺　之機緣，由局部之淋毒，進而混入血液。復由血液循流，入於各部，其入於關節者，發生關節炎。其先或入於一個關節，或二三個關節同時侵入。患者全身倦怠，食慾不振，頭痛，失眠，體溫升騰，恒在四十度以上，關節紅腫，如不急事療治，則恒由紅腫而化膿，復因化膿而成敗血性淋病，往往有生命之危險。　　此症與傳麻質斯症，最易相混。但此則關節之腫痛數目較多，且甚頑固。對於此種症狀之治療，憑余多年來之觀察，認為行抗淋血清之注射，及內服克淋劑，為最有效。因關節炎係全身傳染，範圍極廣，殊非局部之治療所得成功。間亦輔以電氣療法，其內服克淋劑者，則因此等治淋藥有使體內發生抗毒殺菌之功效。因此余治關節炎恒在五六星期中治愈之，若用普通療法，則非三四月不能見效也。但如將此病已傳染妻子，則妻子亦必罹淋毒性白帶，其療法除內服克淋劑外，外用陰道片為坐藥，則奏效亦速。且愈後可免互相傳染也。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言電燙頭髮肇禍  英　　六日報載：山東路大陸理髮所有女學生徐某電燙頭髮，因里髮師不慎，燙時走電，以致當塲暈絕椅上，奄奄待斃，送院醫治後，始漸安醒，聞捕房將予嚴究云云。　　電燙頭髮肇禍的事情，記得以前報章上也登載過不少，有好幾處當局，譬如蘇州等地，還有過禁止濁燙髮的明令。不過禁者自禁，燙者自燙，而一般所謂摩登的婦女，仍然在頭髮上日新月異的花樣翻新。我們一想起前些時，婦女先進們的毅然把三千煩惱絲，盡付諸幷州一剪，原不過是想合乎衛生，免去種種的麻煩，誰料到至今還沒多久的時間，却變成恰恰相反的地步。　　據說電燙頭髮，卽使不發生走電等的危險，對於身體的健康，已經是有害的了，我們再從經濟上受損失去看，每燙一决髮，也很可觀。化這樣大的代價，所獲得的，除了所謂「美觀」，我真不知道還有什麼好處？其實呢，「美」而用到矯揉造作，已經是末流的了，何况旣要花錢，又於健康有礙？　　自然在上海有一部份被環境所逼迫着的婦女不得不把自己裝飾起來以求生活，她們的燙髮還屬情有可原；但是今次燙髮受傷的却是一個正在求学期中的女學生，負責敎育的人，真不應該不加以嚴重的注意了。　　我的意見是：這件事如果「嚴究」起來，無論是燙髮的器械欠佳，抑或理髮師的技術疏劣，固然理髮所都難逃其章責；但是因燙髮而受傷的人，我們也不能說不是她各由自取！　　奉勸一切婦女，還是少學這個「摩登」吧！在深夜裏（續）  羅之華　　我從來沒有聽到誰自己大聲地喊過權威。因爲，這世界已經沒有權威們過的日子了。現在，在這深夜里，他大聲地對我說了，這不是很特殊的嗎？他看着我很低微嗎？不値一顧嗎？他說一說他是權威就可以把我嚇倒嗎？我眞不明白。　　「你眞的是權威嗎？」　　我以前在學校里的書上曾經看見過許多話，他們說，生在這被權威統治着的世界上，我們所尊敬的就是他。你不能說權威是木偶，你不能說他荒淫，你要服從他，他呌你死，你就別生，他呌你走路你就別站住。甚至他呌你往火坑里跳你也不能持疑。我們服從權威要服從到盲從，那樣，他才會點點腦袋，呌你伏下身子，然後坐在你身上，用小刀向你身上一塊塊地剜肉吃。　　但是，到了我們你一代就變了。我沒有看見過權威底樣子，他們害怕我們認識他，他用布蒙着臉，所以，我這樣問他。他尊嚴地答應了我一聲。　　「那麼」你可以使我看見你底影子嗎！」　　「胡說，你底眼不配！我是最高貴純潔的權威！你這——」　　「你不呌我看，你有什麼法子證明你底身份呢？」　　「這個，——你聽……」一種金屬的鞭子底聲音，「我有這東西，一切東西都屬於我，——你也跑不了的，……我是權威！」　　「可是，你知道我們——」　　「你們，」他用鼻子發出不屑一說地聲音：「你們這些傢伙，好像沉思了一下似地，然後說，「你們以爲我管不了你們了，你們想把我底鞭子折斷，把我殺死，把我底一切佔有，——你們多麼狂妄，你們多麼夢想，你們多麼幼稚！我吿訴你們吧，好朋友，你們還是：」　　「住嘴！」我從床上坐起來，披上衣服，像一個戰士披起盔甲一樣，「你快些離開我！我要殺死你！快些，……」　　他冷笑了一下：「你殺死我？—你能够摸到我底脚尖嗎？連屋門也進不來……」　　「可是我們能够把你底屋基動搖，使你摔下來！」　　「我把你們弄疲倦，呌你們死！」　　「我們還可以生，還可以恢復精神，因爲你離不開我們，你要我們供給你生活上的用品！」　　可是你們底精力來不及反抗我了，—像你，現在你已經很疲倦了，你還有能力來跟我門爭嗎？—你不能，你……」　　「我能」，我伸一伸臂，里面發着生命底爲的音響，「我們不怕累！」　　你們爲了什麼呢？這樣賣力氣？給我做事的時候却：」　　「爲了自由！爲了光明！爲了……」　　「住嘴，」他動怒地說，「不要說這討灰的字眼，—在我底鞭子底下，就沒有這些東西，你沒說的權力，我是權威！」　　「可是，我們偏要這樣！」　　「不准說！不准動！」　　他用鞭子柄擊着地板，很警戒地消逝了。　　我底身體更加疲倦了。我被一種力壓制着倒在床上。　　靜靜的夜更深了。我仔細地聽，好像有權威正吃人的聲音，我底四周的空氣也回轉到剛才的樣子。蚊子哼呌着。　　我想，夜深了，天也就明了。……離鄉  任永　　　外祖母從過道口慌張的走進來。一股風似的直撲到媽媽臉前，那多縐紋的面皮上，顯得非常驚慌，她兩眼發直，嘴唇打着顫，待她在一隻麥草墊子上坐下，便氣喘喘的說：　　「我說不呌三了頭上學堂，你偏送了去，你偏送了去！……」　　媽媽給這驚嚇的神氣弄呆了，她不知出了什麼事，兩三個月來天天有謠言傳佈着，說外國兵在十五里外的那個火車站上築了營房，又有人說那些外國人專恨洋學生，將來要讓村長領着按家掏，男的押到牢里，女的他們帶到營房里去，……打關外跑回來的馬老黑就說：「一點不錯，九一八那當兒還活埋哪！」媽媽悲嘆着命運，往决我回家來，她要燒點特別好的菜，給這終年漂泊的兒子吃，這决她失去了那份悠閑的心，每聽見村人們說外國鬼子又到鎭上來了，便擔心的看看我頭髮說：　　「永兒你把頭髮剃了吧，萬一他們查來，你留着那樣頭髮……」　　可是一天天過去了，並沒有人來查，只是鎭北街的客棧里，住了收買銀洋並帶賣白面（海洛英）的韓國人，有時來三五個高顴骨穿洋裝的矮子，沿着北河車站的大鐵橋，向我們村里走，照幾决相，探探河水的深淺，嘰哩刮拉一陣，騎着脚踏車便又去了。　　這時院裏的陽光越來越稀薄，炊烟樣的灰色漸漸在大地上開展，蝙蝠從屋簷下翻着翅膀，到空中劃兩個圈子就又藏進了蔭影裏。　　媽媽用疑問的眼睛看着外祖母，她正　着那鷄爪般的瘦手，指劃着說：　　「三了頭她們學堂裏，有兩敎習呌縣班房里逮走了，說是一個男的一個女的，道兒上使皮鞭子抽他們倆，三了頭回來就明白了，千萬別上學了。」　　「爲什麼逮敎習呢？」媽媽的聲音打着顫，這麼短的句子像都說不下去似的。　　沒有回答。沉默了半嚮，外祖母也解釋不出是怎麼會事來，低低的像跟自己說：「那誰知道呢？」接着又「反正那倆敎習給繩子拴着，跟衙役們進了城是眞的，」　　我沉思着：故鄉一天比一天陷入奴隸的命運里了，如再離開家時，回來的幸運决不會再那麼從容，便憂傷的覺得：對壓上頭來的惡魔不能作一星渺小的抗拒，却打算悄悄的溜出了這陰慘的地帶，躱到一個較寗靜的角落里偷生……　　夜間，媽媽蒼白着臉坐在坑上嘆氣，十三歲的妹妹玲子立在桌邊，張着一</p>

<h3>Li Hanhun's Circular Telegram: Unifying Against Aggression and Maintaining the Overall Situation</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) It is reported that Li Hanhun issued a circular telegram on the sixth, resigning as the Director of the Eastern District Pacification Headquarters. He left Shantou, stating that the Japanese were acting recklessly in Shantou, that negotiations with the Japanese were difficult, and that he had repeatedly telegraphed the province for instructions on resistance measures, but received no concrete responses, which was inconsistent with the Southwest's slogan of resisting Japan. (August 8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) On the seventh, Li Hanhun telegraphed the Central Government, requesting it to guide the changes in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces by taking advantage of the situation, incorporating them into the proper course, unifying military orders, and planning a long-term strategy to resist aggression. He also telegraphed Chen Jitang, urging him to rein in his horse and obey the Central Government. The full text of the telegram is being released. (August 8th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li Hanhun issued five circular telegrams on the seventh, with the full text as follows: Hong Kong Central News Agency, to all newspapers nationwide, for your information. Enclosed are four copies of the telegrams issued by Commissioner Li of this headquarters, addressed to Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang, Commander-in-Chief Chen, leaders at home and abroad, and all generals of the First Army Group. Please publish them in your newspapers to clarify the truth. Respectfully, Secretariat of the Guangdong Eastern District Pacification Headquarters, Yu, (July 7th). To the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, all ministries and commissions, all provincial and municipal Party Headquarters, all provincial and municipal governments, all Pacification Directors, all Commanders-in-Chief, all military and division commanders, all people's organizations, all newspapers, and all overseas Party Headquarters and overseas Chinese organizations: Just now, I submitted a telegram to Commander-in-Chief Chen (another telegram), etc. It is my humble opinion that today, we can only survive by resisting aggression, and we can only resist aggression through unity. I respectfully urge the central authorities to guide the Southwest's current actions by taking advantage of the situation and incorporating them into the proper course. I also request military and political leaders and leaders from all walks of life to advocate unanimously and maintain the overall situation together. I am deeply apprehensive and await orders. Li Hanhun, Deputy Commander of the Second Army of the First Army Group and concurrently Pacification Commissioner of the Eastern District of Guangdong, respectfully kowtows, Yu, Yin. To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government and Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission: The Southwest's call for resistance to Japan has caused national consternation. From the beginning of the decision, not only did senior generals dare not agree, but even two or three elders held dissenting opinions. Later, Commander-in-Chief Chen accepted advice, changed his plans, and focused solely on resisting Japan, with leadership still under the Central Government. However, the winter (2nd) telegram from the two Southwest institutions did not convey this intention. The generals immediately returned to their posts to prepare for war. Tan specially requested to change the banner (4th) telegram, and the Political Committee approved it, gradually advancing troops into neighboring provinces, shaking the central government, and threatening to start a prairie fire. As I am stationed in the Eastern District, which is a crucial point for foreign affairs, the threat of bandits is deepening, and crises are lurking. My wisdom is exhausted, and I am struggling to cope. I believe that to show our determination to resist Japan, we should raise our swords and point eastward, first securing our own territory, and then awaiting orders to advance. The overall situation may then be secured. However, repeated requests have not been adopted. The border guards have been dismissed, and there is no defense equipment. Even if the resistance to Japan comes from sincerity, neglecting what is near to plan for what is far is not a good plan. Moreover, rumors are spreading, and doubts are filling the air. If, unfortunately, an unexpected incident occurs, the country's future is unimaginable. I have the heart to save the country but lack the power to reverse the situation. Therefore, I resign on the (6th), hoping to show my determination and telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Chen, urging him to rein in his horse and obey the Central Government, and telegraphed the generals of this army group, urging them to advocate unanimously and promote its realization together. Today, we can only survive by resisting aggression, and we can only resist aggression through unity. I humbly request your Excellencies to consider my foolish sincerity, plan the overall situation, and guide the Southwest's current actions by taking advantage of the situation and incorporating them into the proper course, unifying military orders, and planning a long-term strategy to resist aggression. I am deeply concerned and await orders. Li Hanhun, Deputy Commander of the Second Army and concurrently Pacification Commissioner of the Eastern District of Guangdong, respectfully kowtows, Yu Yin. To Commander-in-Chief Chen of Guangzhou, strictly confidential. Since the Southwest raised the banner of resisting Japan and mobilized troops, disputes have arisen due to the inconsistency between name and reality, leading to gatherings in the court. If you do not rein in your horse, the disputes of words will evolve into disasters within the walls. Regardless of who wins or loses, the country's affairs will be unbearable. From the beginning of the decision, I was fortunate to have opposed the initial proposal, sincerely believing that the country's difficulties were deep and that goodness had not disappeared. I could not bear to see your Excellencies engage in injustice, nor would I betray your Excellencies and make separate plans. I wept and argued based on reason, believing that I was no different from the upright officials of ancient times. Fortunately, your Excellency accepted my foolish sincerity, changed your plans, and focused solely on resisting aggression, with leadership still under the Central Government. The winter (2nd) telegram from the two Southwest institutions was not far from this intention. The generals then returned to their posts to prepare for war. However, the sudden telegram requesting to change the banner (4th) came, and the Political Committee approved it, gradually advancing troops into neighboring provinces, shaking the central government, and threatening to start a prairie fire. As a result, the military's morale was disturbed, public opinion was boiling, and society was in turmoil. Furthermore, there were rumors of reaching an understanding with Japan, causing suspicion and blame. I firmly believe that your Excellency would never do such a thing. However, the enemy is deliberately creating illusions and playing tricks. The snake's shadow in the cup is endless. For example, in Shantou, negotiations have been frequent for years, and enemy ships have been stationed there, never leaving. However, since the Southwest loudly proclaimed resistance to Japan, all enemy ships have sailed away, presenting an image of peace and tranquility. The Kakuta case is no longer mentioned. Is it because they are intimidated by the sound of resistance and fearfully avoid it? How else can we explain that people are frightened by rumors and turn against their own kin? However, temporary appeasement is not lasting. When the enemy sees our wavering attitude, they will send warships to oppress us again. As I am stationed in the Eastern District, I bear the heavy responsibility of defending the territory. However, the border guards have been dismissed, and there is no defense equipment. I have previously constructed fortifications, but people's hearts are divided, making diplomacy ineffective. The generals and officers yearn for the banners pointing north and lament the lack of competitive spirit in the south. I foolishly believe that everyone has the same heart for resisting aggression and saving the country. However, the banners must be clear, and words and actions must be consistent. Verbal attacks and accusations can only bring temporary satisfaction, leading to the collapse of neighbors and ultimately benefiting the enemy. The Second Plenary Session is approaching, and the Central Government has its own plans for the overall situation. However, the enemy has recently made rapid advances in North China, attempting to annex it entirely, and is also maneuvering in the Southwest, plotting to seize both sides. Since this army group has sworn to sacrifice for resisting aggression and saving the country, we should be determined and take the lead, rather than neglecting what is near to plan for what is far and missing the opportunity. To show our determination to resist Japan, we should raise our swords and point eastward. I have repeatedly suggested this, but it has not been adopted. A single misstep can endanger the entire situation. Today, the threat of bandits is deepening, and the people are criticizing. If we can reverse course in time, securing our eastern border, and prepare for the Central Government's request for severing diplomatic relations with Japan and launching a war of resistance, the righteous voice will spread, the defenses will be renewed, the hidden dangers will be eliminated, and a new chapter of heroism will be opened. It is not just the Southwest that will rise up. However, some may worry that the Central Government will seize the opportunity to take advantage of our weakness. Unless they are cowardly and flattering, they should understand that the current way out for the country and the survival of the nation lies in unity, which is better than aimless actions. I have the heart to save the country but lack the power to reverse the situation. I am ashamed of my position. Therefore, I resign and return my command, pouring out my heart and doing my best to offer loyal words. If you can heed my foolish sincerity and consider the meaning of my actions, uniting and saving the country, then I am willing to await punishment, even if it means being executed in the marketplace. Otherwise, I cannot save people from a well, and I dare not taint my integrity. I hope your Excellencies will understand me. Furthermore, I want to declare that my rash actions are purely out of utmost sincerity in loving the country and the people, driven by my conscience and blood. My heart is clear and can be tested by heaven and earth. As for the current situation in the Eastern District, Director Li Mai can maintain it. All remaining funds, approximately 200,000, will be safely stored and not misused. I firmly believe that the responsible officials will continue to be meticulous and not engage in any embezzlement. I also request that a replacement be appointed quickly so that I can properly hand over the affairs. Urgent matters cannot be fully expressed. I am deeply concerned and await orders. Li Hanhun respectfully kowtows, Yu (June 6th), Yin. To Commander Miao of Guangzhou, Deputy Commander Lin, Division Commanders Tan, Chen, and Zhang, Commander Chen of the Garrison, Commander Huang of the Air Force, Vice-Principal Lin of the Military Academy, Commander Li of the Military Police, Commander Zhang of the Navy, Deputy Commander Li, Director He of the Public Security Bureau, Chairman Li of the Air Defense Committee, Commander Li of Humen, Commander Yu of Dayu, Deputy Commander Li, Division Commanders Mo and Zhang, Commander Zhang of Shaoguan, Division Commanders Wu, Li, and Huang, Brigade Commander Kong, Commander Li of Huizhou, Deputy Commander Huang, Division Commanders Ye and Tan, Commander Huang of Meixian, Deputy Commanders Huang and Zeng, Division Commanders Yan and Chen, Committee Member Fan Xiu of the Central District, Committee Member Zhou of the Southern District, Committee Member Chen of the Western District, and Committee Member Xu of Qiongya: Just now, I submitted a telegram to the Commander-in-Chief (another telegram), etc. I respectfully request that you respond to each other, adhere to the original intention, either openly call out or earnestly plead, preserve the glory of history, and reverse the tide. The future of the Party and the country depends on it. Your brother Li Hanhun, Yu Yin. (August 8th Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Smuggling into Eastern Hebei Gradually Decreases</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Dalian currently has 50,000 bags of sugar stockpiled, waiting to be shipped to Tianjin. Recently, there has been a gradual decrease in smuggling from Hebei. According to the Ronin Trade Association, this is due to the following reasons: 1. The current sales of rayon and sugar are in a slow season. 2. Customs enforcement is very strict south of Xuzhou, making it difficult to sell goods outside. 3. There is too much inventory in Tianjin, causing sales congestion. The ports of Nanda Temple and Qin Island, which previously unloaded smuggled goods, have been abolished. (August 8th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Review of the Nature of County and Township Banks</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The plan to establish county and township banks extensively, which has been under consideration by the Ministry of Finance for a long time, will likely be implemented in the near future. It is said that the draft regulations for county and township banks have been completed. In principle, the establishment of these types of banks can, on the one hand, make the financing between cities and villages and between villages smoother. On the other hand, it can also free farmers from the shackles of usurious loans from local tyrants and landlords. However, upon studying the actual situation, we cannot help but have some concerns. Because county and township banks are to be established widely in various places, the government's financial resources are limited. It is feared that the bank's capital will have to rely on local wealthy gentlemen and landlords. In this way, they can easily occupy important positions in the bank and directly or indirectly control the actual management power. The resulting abuses will not only prevent farmers from obtaining real benefits, but local wealthy gentlemen and landlords may also use these financial institutions to intensify the exploitation of farmers. This violates the original purpose of establishing county and township banks.</p>
<p>We believe that the main tasks of county and township banks are to regulate inland finance, promote the sale of domestic products, and assist poor farmers to increase agricultural productivity. Then, the targets for loans must have strict restrictions. Of course, loans should be granted as much as possible to farmers who are genuinely engaged in production. However, except for absolutely necessary items, no convenience should be given to the transportation and sale of all imported products. Strict precautions must be taken against local tyrants and evil gentry who do not engage in production, preventing them from borrowing money from county and township banks and then re-lending it to poor farmers at high interest to profit from it. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Chinese farmers have suffered deeply from the exploitation of high-interest loans. The loan interest rates of county and township banks should be reduced as much as possible so that farmers can use low-interest funds to engage in re-production. At the same time, the scope of collateral for farmers' loans must be broadly defined, and credit guarantees (such as mutual guarantees among farmers) should be accepted as much as possible. Because, in general, poor farmers may not have other property that can be used as collateral other than the few necessary production tools they possess. If they are forced to deposit strict collateral, most poor farmers will be unable to access loans and will still have to groan under the exploitation of high-interest loans from local tyrants and landlords. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Although county and township banks are under the jurisdiction of the government, they must maintain a certain degree of independence for their own sound operation. The government should not arbitrarily borrow money or sell bonds from these types of banks. Measures must be taken to prevent local governments from borrowing or extorting funds by force. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Today, the lives of inland farmers can be described as extremely difficult. If county and township banks are managed properly, they can indeed achieve the effect of relief. However, if they are poorly managed, they will certainly become nominal. We hope that the government will consider the above points before preparing to establish the banks. Then, the future county and township banks will have a real benefit for the livelihood of the inland people.</p>
<h3>Post-Disaster Work on the Zhongxiang Remote Dike Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>(Hankou) When the Zhongxiang Remote Dike collapsed again, Fan Xixu supervised the emergency rescue work at the risk of his life. After the collapse, Fan convened a meeting and advocated re-closing the breach, but was opposed by a majority. The reasons were: 1. The Han River frequently bursts during the flood season, making it difficult to successfully close the gap by chance. 2. The hot weather has led to many epidemics, and workers are dying one after another. 3. 3 million yuan has already been used, and it is not easy to raise more funds. 4. All four sections are built of sand, and even if the breach is closed, the two ends will inevitably collapse. Therefore, it was proposed to temporarily conclude the post-disaster committee, dismiss the workers, and stop the northern work. (August 8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Water Levels Rise in Various Rivers of Southern Hebei</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Baoding Dispatch: Heavy rains in southern Hebei caused a surge in the Yellow River. The water level reached 58.53 meters, an increase of approximately one meter. Furthermore, the Hutuo River experienced a flash flood, causing a significant rise in water levels, reaching 99.90 meters, only six centimeters from the top of the dam. The situation is extremely dangerous. The River Bureau has dispatched workers to reinforce the embankments and has requested funds from the province for emergency repairs. On the 7th, the water level of the Yongding River rose by eleven feet. Continuous rain is expected upstream, with the peak of the flood arriving in three days. The southern section of the embankment is in danger. The current at Lugou Bridge is swift and turbulent. The River Bureau has telegraphed the province requesting funds. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jin County is preparing for potential flooding of the Yongding River. Assisted by the North China Water Conservancy Commission, a levee defense committee has been established in Shuangkou Town, with Zhao Zuoyun appointed as chairman. He will lead the local populace in protecting the levee. Due to the significant rise in the Yongding River and the high sediment content, the North China Water Conservancy Commission has been utilizing the current to release silt in the central channel since the 7th.

<h3>Qiantang River Water Level Gradually Receding</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) The water level of the Qiantang River was 7.6 meters on the morning of the 8th, and approximately 7.1 meters at 6 PM, showing signs of gradual recession. According to Luo Ying, Chief Engineer of the Qiantang River Railway Bridge, the bridge project, thanks to comprehensive preventative measures, has not suffered any unexpected losses. Furthermore, one-third of all bridge pier construction has been completed and is expected to be entirely above water by the end of the year. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) The government is scheduled to announce tomorrow supplementary estimates for the Navy, Army, and Air Force. This demonstrates the government's deep concern about the European situation and its desire to quickly strengthen national defense. The supplementary estimates are reportedly substantial, with Army expenses estimated between six and seven million pounds, Air Force expenses nearly ten million pounds, and Navy expenses yet to be disclosed. Recent developments in the European situation have made British cabinet members feel that strengthening national defense is a matter of utmost urgency, and their decision began with discussions of balancing the budget.

<h3>Anglo-Egyptian Treaty Negotiations</h3>
<p>Military Aspects Proceeding Smoothly</p>
<p>Differing Opinions on the Sudan Issue</p>
<p>Cairo The Anglo-Egyptian negotiations, which once took place in 1930 with the hope of concluding an agreement, ultimately failed due to differing opinions on the Sudan issue. The government has recently published the details of those negotiations in the form of a white paper. Regarding this matter, sources familiar with the Egyptian political situation claim that the current negotiations are proceeding smoothly on military aspects. Once the negotiations are successful, Britain will make significant concessions on the Sudan issue to facilitate an agreement. (8th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Montreux Conference British and Russian Disagreement Russian Ships Have the Right to Freely Enter and Exit the Black Sea Russia's Request Not Granted, Threatening to Withdraw from Conference</h3>
<p>Montreal Due to a dispute between British and Russian representatives at the Montreux Conference, the Russian representative, Litvinov, may return directly to Moscow. If so, the conference will fail. Litvinov has received instructions from his government that unless certain demands are met to his satisfaction, he must withdraw from the conference. The most important demand for Soviet Russia is to allow Russian ships complete freedom to enter and exit the Black Sea. Since the opening of the conference, British and Russian opinions have been in conflict. The Russian representative accused Britain of deliberately obstructing Soviet Russia and then requested instructions from his government, resulting in the above instructions. Litvinov met with British chief delegate Lord Stanley this afternoon and said that if a compromise could not be reached, he would return home. This morning, the British delegation proposed a draft of Article 16, an amendment to the preamble, which contained: "If Turkey believes its security is threatened, it has the right to block the straits and prohibit the passage of warships of belligerent nations." "In wars in which none of the coastal countries are belligerents, the warships of belligerent nations should be prohibited from passing through the straits." Soviet Russia then proposed an answer, advocating prohibiting the passage of warships of belligerent nations through the straits, except when belligerents are fulfilling their obligations under the League of Nations covenant. Neither suggestion was accepted by the conference. The Russian delegation claimed that their amendment was a significant concession, but Britain still held firm objections to it. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Montreal The Montreux Conference continued to meet this morning, focusing on Article 16 of the British proposal, which advocated that the Black Sea should remain open even during wartime, but no definitive results were achieved, and further discussions are scheduled for tomorrow morning. Regarding this matter, the representatives of Britain, Japan, and Turkey have requested instructions from their respective governments, and the representatives of Britain, France, Russia, and Romania are scheduled to hold informal talks this afternoon. (8th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>City of Montreux, Switzerland The Montreux Conference held a closed plenary session today, completing the review of Articles 1 to 15 of the British proposal (a total of twenty-six articles) and scheduled to continue the meeting at 10:00 AM tomorrow to discuss the issue of warships of various countries passing through the straits during wartime. Regarding this matter, Article 16 of the British proposal advocated that the Black Sea should remain open during wartime, allowing warships of various countries to pass freely, and suggested organizing a standing patrol to cooperate with Turkey and Greece to maintain the opening of the straits. The Soviet Union, however, advocated that the Black Sea should be closed during wartime, so it opposed the British proposal for free passage. The discussions at today's meeting concerned the issues of warships of various countries passing through the straits during peacetime and staying in the Black Sea. The most important points are described as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the passage of oil tankers, submarines, and aircraft carriers through the straits: (A) Oil tankers: The original Turkish proposal advocated that they should be treated the same as all warships and restricted, which was opposed by the French representatives, Peng Gu (former Minister without Portfolio) and Ponso (Ambassador to Turkey), who insisted that the French fleet should have the right to replenish oil. As a result, the conference decided that oil tankers should not be regarded as warships, and their passage through the straits would not be restricted and would be exempt from taxes. (B) Submarines: The Turkish and Soviet representatives both advocated prohibiting passage through the straits. Although the French representative maintained the traditional view that submarines should be treated the same as other warships and allowed to pass, due to the special political situation in the Black Sea, this French view was ultimately abandoned. (C) Aircraft carriers: The British representative advocated that they should be allowed to pass, which was also opposed by Turkey and Russia, with the Soviet Union expressing the strongest opposition. The British representative ultimately declared that if the conference accepted the Soviet Union's proposal, he would have to request instructions from his government. For the most part, Turkey and Russia's proposals are likely to be satisfied. The British advocated that the tonnage of any warship of a country that is not a Black Sea coastal state permitted to stay in the Black Sea should not exceed three-quarters of the total tonnage of warships of all countries in the area. Regarding this, the conference must unanimously agree to reduce the ratio of three-quarters to two-thirds. (According to the British, this total tonnage is set at 30,000 tons, which can be increased to 45,000 tons in special circumstances.)</p>
<p>The conference also decided that the period of stay of warships of various countries entering the Black Sea for disaster relief should be restricted. (7th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Conference Prospects Not Optimistic</h3>
<p>Turkey's Impression of British Plan is Unfavorable</p>
<p>Ankara According to the semi-official Anatolian News Agency, after the British government presented a new public plan regarding the straits at the Montreux Conference (according to the British plan, it is a revision of the draft proposed by Turkey, the main points of which were seen in yesterday's telegram), this has already created a bad impression. Therefore, political figures are pessimistic about the future situation of the conference. (7th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Italy Refuses to Attend</h3>
<p>Demanding the Cancellation of the Mediterranean Agreement as a Condition; Russia and France's Naval Mutual Assistance Deeply Feared by Germany</p>
<p>Montreal After the Montreux Conference reconvened, Italy, citing the British fleet not being withdrawn from the Mediterranean and the mutual assistance agreement among Mediterranean coastal countries not being abolished, refused to send representatives to participate. Figures around various national delegations here have severely criticized Italy's attitude, fearing that the country may further raise more significant demands as a condition for rejoining international cooperation efforts, such as demanding the revision of the League of Nations Covenant. However, even though Italy is absent, the Montreux Conference should continue, or even conclude a public agreement, not counting Italy. As for Turkey's demand to set up defensive works in the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits, it should be granted regardless of Italy's attitude. (7th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Naval figures recently declared that before British Ambassador to Sweden Sir Phelps returned home the other day, German Foreign Minister Neurath met with him, raising important reservations regarding the impact of the future Montreux Conference public agreement on the Anglo-German naval agreement (concluded on June 18 last year), and it was confirmed by German Chargé d'Affaires Prince Bismarck to the Foreign Office. It is said that the arguments cited by Germany are mainly the following two points: The Soviet fleet will soon be able to pass freely through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits, which is enough to change the situation when the Anglo-German naval agreement was signed; The Montreux Conference is expected to prohibit Soviet fleets from sailing out of the Black Sea from mooring in Mediterranean ports. As a result, the Soviet Black Sea Fleet will sail to the Baltic Sea to increase the strength of the original fleet there. This is a threat to Germany. The British government has reportedly submitted a reply to Germany, refuting point by point, stating that the Soviet fleet already has the right to pass freely through the straits; The Montreux Conference does not intend to prohibit Soviet warships from mooring in Mediterranean ports.

<h3>Soviet Naval Strength in the Far East</h3>
<p>Harbin News from the Foreign Press Office: The Soviet Union's active strengthening of its Far East policy has manifested in gathering troops in the Far East, and the behavior of border guards has made the Far East political situation extremely complicated. At the same time, it is striving to strengthen the Pacific Fleet stationed in Vladivostok. In order to boost morale, the Soviet government specially summoned young officers to the Kremlin Palace and awarded them medals. According to information from a certain agency that recently arrived in Changchun, since the Soviet Union entered the Second Five-Year Plan, military preparations have been intensified with feverishness, and naval power has also been greatly strengthened in parallel with the increase and strengthening of Red Army forces. In these three years, for the Pacific Fleet alone, there have been forty to fifty submarines. According to recent investigations, the current naval strength and fleet organization of the Soviet Union are as follows:</p>
<p>Naval Districts and Fleet Organization</p>
<p>The Soviet naval area is composed of the following five districts: Baltic Naval District, White Sea Naval District, Arctic Sea Naval District, Caspian Sea Naval District, Pacific Naval District</p>
<p>Each naval district has a naval command, fleet, and other naval agencies. Those in charge of these agencies are the commanders of the naval districts. In addition, there is the Heilongjiang Fleet, which belongs to the Pacific Naval District, and the Launiplu Fleet, which belongs to the Black Sea Naval District. Both are river fleets. The Heilongjiang Fleet is organized as follows: five ships of 1,000 tons, ten ships of 200 tons, twenty reserve ships, and one seaplane carrier.</p>
<h3>Germany Uses White Russians to Help Ukraine Become Independent</h3>
<p>As a Preliminary Step to Disintegrating the Soviet Union</p>
<p>(Vienna) According to news here today, Germany is uniting with Austria, Yugoslavia, and Hungary to promote the establishment of an independent Ukrainian government as a preliminary step to disintegrating Soviet Russia. The White Russian newspaper in the Yugoslav capital has requested White Russians everywhere to unite in order to seize the opportunity to overthrow the Soviet Russian government and requested White Russians to unite with anyone who allows Ukraine freedom, even if the price is being occupied by foreign troops and developed by foreign countries. Furthermore, a certain White Russian newspaper in Paris has moved to Berlin because the editor of the newspaper said that the French government has been influenced by Moscow. In addition, some White Russian organizations are also planning to move to Berlin. Recently, the National Socialist Party government has shown considerable favor to White Russians, which is particularly noteworthy. According to overseas Chinese returning from Ukraine, the anti-Moscow movement there is quite active. (7th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Locarno Conference Imminent Various Powers Actively Negotiating</h3>
<p>Invitation to Italy to Participate Has Been Sent; Britain, France, and Belgium Plan to Form a Common Front</p>
<p>(Rome) The Locarno Conference is scheduled to open in this capital on the 22nd of this month. Count Chatelbert, the Belgian Chargé d'Affaires in Italy, delivered an invitation to Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano this morning, requesting the Italian government to send representatives to participate, and inquired whether this date was appropriate. Ciano replied that he would respond tomorrow. (8th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Responsible sources recently declared that Italy will remain completely outside of recent international negotiations, including those related to the Free City of Danzig, and said, "As far as the Danzig issue is concerned, Italy has adopted an attitude of friendly neutrality." As for the future Locarno Conference, Italy has not yet received an invitation. If Italy is invited to attend, its participation will depend on the conditions of the invitation. If Sweden does not attend the meeting, Italy does not intend to participate. (7th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) With the Locarno Conference approaching, experts from the Foreign Office are meticulously studying the situation and agenda of the conference, and will prepare a report for Foreign Secretary Eden to serve as the basis for future cabinet discussions. It is generally known that France attaches the greatest importance to the future situation of this conference, and what its delegation advocated in Geneva is that at the time of the meeting of the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact, all the facts of the issue, from the German army entering the Rhineland area to the German government's delay in replying to the British memorandum, should be filed. Belgian Prime Minister Tsiran, on the other hand, has proposed that the Locarno Conference should submit the issue of the signatory countries of the pact concluding a security agreement for research and seek its realization. The scope of this agreement is limited to the border areas of Germany, France, and Belgium along the Rhine River, and Germany provides guarantees (referring to not invading the borders of France and Belgium). People here generally believe that Prime Minister Tsiran's proposal is indeed constructive, and if it is realized, it will definitely satisfy the wishes of most people in Britain, so they all feel interested, and they say that the method of guaranteeing the security of the Rhine River border is in line with the intention of German leader Hitler, and should be acceptable to the country. However, once the Western Rhine River Security Agreement is established, it is tantamount to allowing Germany to act freely on other borders. If so, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Austria will inevitably feel unhappy, thinking that Western European countries only care about their own borders and abandon those countries, and this cannot but be noted. As for whether Italy will participate in the Locarno Conference, nothing is known at this time. Therefore, the research work carried out by experts from the Foreign Office can only be concluded after Britain, France, and Italy have held talks. (7th Havas Dispatch) (Italy is still creating many obstacles for rejoining European cooperation efforts, and the newspapers here have recently commented on this. The Socialist Party newspaper "People's Daily" stated, "We are now increasingly in favor of concluding a Mediterranean pact. It does not matter even if Italy does not participate. It is green that this country now has a desire to move about in the Mediterranean. We must do our best to stop it. The only way to stop it is to make Italian Prime Minister Mussolini understand that the Mediterranean pact will ultimately be established quickly and will never be hindered or delayed by Italy. It would be good if the country is willing to participate. If it wants to stay out of it, it should be allowed to do so."</p>
<p>The "Paris Echo" published an article by renowned journalist Bertina, which stated that informed sources are rumored that the Locarno Conference will not be attended by Germany or Italy. "From this point of view, there is little doubt that Italy will not participate in the first stage of the Locarno Conference. In that case, it would be unwise for the ministers of Britain, France, and Belgium to still strive for Germany to attend the conference. For the present, the three countries of Britain, France, and Belgium should form a common front in the future Locarno Conference, in other words: 1. Britain guarantees the borders of France and Belgium. 2. The three countries make their own military preparations and adjust them. 3. Adopt a consistent attitude towards the problems of Central Europe and Eastern Europe. If the British Cabinet does not approve of the above three points, then the Locarno Conference may as well be postponed indefinitely," he said. (8th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Danzig Publicly Declares a Severance of Relations with the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Refuses to Acknowledge League of Nations Commissioners; Almost a Prelude to Germany Annexing Danzig</p>
<p>Danzig The authorities here formally announced today that the Free City of Danzig has severed relations with the League of Nations. From now on, the Senate and officials at all levels will no longer recognize Lester, the League of Nations High Commissioner in Danzig. People generally recognize this as a prelude to Danzig's annexation by Germany. (7th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Official circles stated today that Lester, the League of Nations High Commissioner in Danzig, may resign. If so, he will be succeeded by Babby, the Polish representative in Danzig. However, this move will be delayed for several weeks to avoid the League of Nations appearing to submit to Germany, and it is internally decided to have a Pole succeed him. Its role is, on the one hand, to draw Poland closer to the League of Nations, and on the other hand, to resist Germany. (7th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>National Socialist Party's Arrogance High</h3>
<p>Clues to Eliminating Dissidents Have Been Revealed</p>
<p>City of Danzig After Mr. Grazer, Chairman of the Municipal Senate, reported to the German authorities in Berlin on the proceedings of the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting, he returned here today. No fewer than several thousand people waited at the station. After Grazer got off the train, he immediately delivered a speech to the crowd, saying, "At this moment, I cannot tell the truth in all sincerity, as I advocate in my heart, but this opportunity is not far away. In short, the German Fatherland has not forgotten the people of this city. This is something the people of this city should be proud of." After speaking, he took a car to the Senate to present a report to the senators. According to general speculation, after Grazer returns here, the Senate will take strict measures to eliminate all the remaining forces of the opposition party in the Free City and activities of a non-National Socialist nature, so that there will be no remnants. This trend has now been revealed. In addition to the 150 party members of parties opposing the municipal government being arrested yesterday, the printing plant of the Socialist Party newspaper, The People's Voice, which had previously been ordered to suspend publication for three months, was also suddenly occupied by the police this afternoon. It is expected that all newspapers opposing the National Socialist Party will be banned in the near future, and the opposition parties (namely the Socialist Party, the Catholic Central Party, and the National Rights Party) may also face misfortune. The parties have recently issued an appeal to the people of the city, saying that in this environment, the only things that can protect the rights of the people of the Free City are the Danzig City Constitution and the League of Nations High Commissioner. The people of this city must know how to choose, etc. In addition, Mr. Lester, the High Commissioner of the League of Nations stationed in this city, also arrived here tonight. After getting off the train, he quietly walked back to his official residence, which paled in comparison to the crowd's cheers when Grazer arrived at the station. However, the police station sent many police officers to protect the station and its official residence to prevent accidents. In addition, the stormtroopers and guards of the National Socialist Party in this city have become stronger and stronger because members sent by Germany have been arriving in a steady stream. National Socialist Party officials in this city also occasionally transfer positions with officials of the party in Germany. In addition, several police officers have been transferred to Germany to be promoted to important positions for their merits in arresting opposition party members or interfering in reactionary activities, in order to encourage them.

<h3>Can Germany and Poland Reach a Compromise?</h3>

<h3>Hitler Plans Another Reckless Move</h3>
<p>Where the Trouble Will Start Remains Unseen</p>
<p>(London) Newspapers continue to regard the Danzig issue as the main subject of criticism. Many believe that the danger of war will not arise before the end of the Olympic Games. The Daily Express reports, "When will the Führer of Germany, Hitler, seize the city of Danzig? It is expected that it will be after the end of the Olympic Games. At that time, Germany will have accumulated much, the treasury will be full, preparations will be complete, and it can then act recklessly." The Morning Post reports, "Once the Olympic Games conclude, Germany will resume its activities. As for where the trouble will start, whether in the city of Danzig, the Memel Territory, Austria, or Czechoslovakia, no government in the world can foresee it. Even Hitler himself often has not decided." (Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Morning Post recently commented on the situation in Eastern Europe, stating, "Germany's threat to Czechoslovakia is even greater than its threat to the city of Danzig. This is because Czechoslovakia, apart from having alliances with France, the Soviet Union, Romania, and Yugoslavia, is essentially in an isolated position. Moreover, these alliances will only take effect when its territory is invaded. Germany is well aware of this, so it is unlikely to resort to armed aggression against Czechoslovakia. Instead, it will likely instigate incidents through the German minority in Czechoslovakia, under the direction of the German government. If this happens, Czechoslovakia's allies may find it difficult to provide substantial assistance. As for Austria, given the current attitude of Italy, it should be possible to prevent Germany from acting as it pleases for some time." (Havas dispatch, August 8)</p>

<h3>Sasaki Case: Japan Criticizes British Judiciary, Britain Lodges Protest</h3>
<p>Indian Merchant Arrested in Changchun: Alleged Violation of British Extraterritorial Rights</p>
<p>(London) The British government, due to the improper attitude of the Japanese authorities towards the recent trial by the British Consulate regarding the death of Japanese military officer Sasaki, instructed Sir Clive, the British Ambassador to Tokyo, to lodge a protest with the Japanese Foreign Ministry on July 4. The protest focused on the various criticisms made by the Japanese during the trial. After the verdict, Japanese newspapers published various articles, seemingly instructed, criticizing British judicial procedures. Sir Clive also strongly protested the arrest of Indian merchant Hussein in Changchun, stating that this constituted a violation of British extraterritorial rights. Hussein was arrested on June 17 on suspicion of defrauding a shop owner. The Japanese authorities did not hand him over to the nearest British Consulate for trial, but instead imprisoned Hussein, his wife, and their son, without notifying the British Consul-General in Shenyang. The British Acting Consul-General in Harbin indirectly heard of this news five days later and reported it to the British Consul-General in Shenyang. The British Consul-General in Shenyang demanded the release of Hussein and his family, but the Japanese authorities ignored this demand. The British Vice-Consul met with Hussein on June 26. It was reported that the entire family was subjected to harsh treatment in prison. The British authorities later negotiated with Tokyo, and Hussein and his family were released on July 5. It is reported that the Japanese authorities currently do not intend to prosecute Hussein. (Reuters dispatch, August 7)</p>
<h3>Two Opposing Factions in Japanese Political Circles Regarding Britain</h3>
<p>One Advocates Adjusting Diplomatic Relations, the Other Advocates a Hard-Line Approach</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese political circles are currently divided into two factions regarding their attitude towards Britain. One faction advocates authorizing Ambassador Yoshida in Britain to conduct negotiations with the British government to adjust Anglo-Japanese diplomatic relations, hoping to ease the boycott of Japanese goods in British colonies, so that Japan's nascent industries can flourish. The other faction advocates pursuing an active and independent economic policy, demanding that Britain open its colonies and implement a redistribution of global resources and markets, and is willing to use bloodshed, if necessary, to achieve its goals. The former is backed by industrial capitalists, while the latter is supported by young military officers. The diplomatic authorities believe that relying on others is undesirable, but acting too hastily is also inappropriate. Therefore, they advocate gradually encroaching on global markets in a peaceful manner, while observing the evolution of the situation and adapting to circumstances.

<h3>Japan-Australia Trade War</h3>
<p>Australian Government Implements a Licensing System to Resist Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Canberra: The trade war initiated by Japan in retaliation for the Australian government's increase in import tariffs on Japanese goods will enter a new phase on Friday when the Australian government resists the attack. The Australian government has issued a notice that, starting from July 10, it will implement a licensing system for Japanese imports, covering 33 percent of the value of those imports. The items listed include clothing, cotton yarn, glassware, paper, electrical appliances, machinery, and toys. Cotton, rayon, and cotton cloth are not included. Previously, wool merchants, who were most affected by the Japanese boycott of Australian goods, held a meeting. Subsequently, Australian Prime Minister Lyons and Japanese Consul-General Shirasu consulted here. The Japanese Consul-General argued that commercial negotiations should continue on the current basis, that is, with the Japanese commercial protection laws remaining in effect. He also stated that if the Australian government implements retaliatory measures, negotiations cannot continue. The Australian government then resolutely announced the implementation of a licensing system for Japanese goods. Lyons also issued a statement saying that this licensing system is necessary to place the two countries on an equal footing for negotiations. He will make two suggestions to Japan: first, to end Japan's discriminatory orders against Australian goods and resume the broken commercial talks; second, for both parties to continue to implement discriminatory orders and resume talks.

<h3>Radio Antenna Tower to Be Built in Saitama Prefecture, Japan</h3>
<p>Ten Meters Higher Than the Eiffel Tower in Paris; Full Completion Expected Next Autumn</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Kawaguchi City, Saitama Prefecture, Japan, will soon build a radio antenna tower that exceeds the height of the world's tallest Eiffel Tower in Paris by more than ten meters. The 150-kilowatt high-power broadcasting equipment of the Japan Broadcasting Corporation is being rushed to completion by Tokyo Electric Wireless Co., Ltd., and is already 80% complete. However, although the machinery has been manufactured, the method of constructing the antenna tower is attracting worldwide attention because Japan is a country prone to earthquakes and typhoons. After careful research by Chief Engineer Ito and other technical authorities, an excellent Japanese-made product has been completed. The construction of a completely Japanese-made grand antenna tower, which will be the pride of the world, is underway. The antenna for the first broadcast will be 312 meters high, and the antenna for the second broadcast will be slightly smaller, at 200 meters. There will be elevator equipment for ascending and descending. Under the grand antenna tower, there will be oil storage tanks, warehouses, power generation rooms, pump rooms, and broadcasting rooms. Due to the need for high power, 15,000 koku of water will be required every night. Underground construction has already begun, and the entire project is expected to be completed by next autumn.

<h3>Hindenburg Flies Low Over British Territory</h3>
<p>Violation of Agreement Without Permission; British Government Lodges Protest with Germany</p>
<p>(London) During today's House of Commons session, the issue of the German airship "Hindenburg" recently flying over important British towns on July 5 while returning from the United States was raised. Conservative MP Adams asked the House to note that the "Hindenburg" had flown low over Leeds twice in several weeks. He questioned whether the British government allows foreign aircraft to deviate from designated routes and fly over Britain at will without adequate altitude. Sir Philip Sassoon, the Under-Secretary of State for Air, replied that the British government had already taken up the matter with the German government. According to the Anglo-German air agreement, the "Hindenburg" and the large "Zeppelin" should avoid Britain unless absolutely necessary. Furthermore, according to the agreement, scheduled airships have no right to fly over Britain. Although the two countries permit each other's aircraft to have freedom of transit, scheduled air transport routes must first obtain formal permission. (Reuters dispatch, August 8)</p>
<h3>Former Soviet Foreign Minister Chicherin Dies</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Former People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Georgy Chicherin, after a long illness, died today in Moscow at the age of 64. (TASS dispatch, August 8)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The medical report on Chicherin has been released, signed by Dr. Levitt and Professor Shirshovsky, stating, "Chicherin suffered from severe diabetes in 1925 and contracted neuritis in 1928, requiring long-term treatment abroad. After returning to Moscow in 1930, he received constant medical care. In 1936, he suffered a stroke and lost consciousness. Despite various treatments, his heart activity grew weaker and weaker, eventually leading to his death." (TASS dispatch, August 8)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Georgy Chicherin, who served as Soviet Foreign Minister for twelve years, passed away today at the age of 64. He was recognized even by his enemies as a master of diplomacy. He retired due to illness in 1930, and was succeeded by Litvinov. During the Russian Revolution in November 1917, Chicherin was imprisoned in Britain for his anti-war activities. He was released the following year. At the time, the British Ambassador to Russia, Sir George Buchanan, was also detained by the Soviet government, and they were exchanged and returned to their respective countries. Upon Chicherin's arrival in Russia, he replaced Trotsky as Foreign Minister. At that time, Russia was besieged on all sides, and almost all countries in the world were its enemies. However, Chicherin handled the situation with ease and eventually led various countries to recognize the Soviet government. In 1922, he established the Treaty of Rapallo with Germany, laying the foundation for relations with Europe. These achievements were largely due to Chicherin's efforts alone. Chicherin was born in 1872. His parents were nobles with modest wealth. After his father's death, he lived with his mother in St. Petersburg. Because his wealth was less than that of other nobles, Chicherin developed a deep aversion to aristocratic society as he grew up, leading him to become a revolutionary leader. He initially connected with revolutionary elements and joined the Social Democratic Party from 1899 to 1904. He then fled abroad to engage in revolution. At that time, the distinction between Bolshevism and Menshevism was not yet clear. Even after the success of Bolshevism, Chicherin still tried to reconcile the two. Like Lenin and Trotsky, Chicherin was impoverished when he fled abroad, and he frequently changed his name and had no fixed abode. At the beginning of the Great War, he was in France organizing anti-war demonstrations. Chicherin had some strange habits. He liked to work at night, so when he was Foreign Minister, staff members were instructed to work at night, and he would often invite foreign envoys to the Foreign Ministry for talks at three or four in the morning. He also received journalists at this time. Although Chicherin devoted his life to the laboring class party, his demeanor and appearance still retained a noble air.

<h3>National Election Headquarters to Be Established After Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Budget to Be Approved by Political Council Next Week</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Internal preparations for the National Assembly Representative Election Headquarters are largely complete. Some staff from the first, second, and third groups have already begun working at the headquarters. The headquarters could have been announced within the week, but because the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee opened this week, the directors, deputy directors, general directors, and deputy general directors are all members of the Central Committee and must attend the meeting. This makes it difficult to manage both responsibilities. Therefore, the establishment of the headquarters will be after the Second Plenary Session. After the headquarters is established, the first, second, and third groups will be established accordingly. The sixth, seventh, and eighth groups will be established within one month, and the fourth and fifth groups will be established one month before the opening of the assembly.

<h3>Cotton Mills Request Relief from the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to industrial sources, the Japanese cotton industry in China, with Tianjin, Qingdao, and Hankou as its major bases, has severely impacted the sales of Chinese cotton. The machinery of Chinese merchants' factories is outdated, the technology and management are poor, and the cost of production has increased. The selling price of each bundle must be reduced by more than 20 to 30 yuan compared to Japanese cotton. Currently, factories with slightly more capital are reducing their working hours, while factories with insufficient capital are shutting down altogether. Japanese factories are significantly increasing the number of spindles. The cotton market in North China and the Yangtze River region is almost exclusively dominated by Japanese merchants. Cotton mills in various regions lack the ability to save themselves and have telegraphed the Ministry of Industry requesting relief. The Ministry of Industry is currently planning a comprehensive solution. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>President Ju's Speech: Reforming the Judiciary – Past Errors and Future Innovations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) President Ju gave a radio address on the 7th regarding the transformation of the judiciary and recent judicial reforms, stating that the National Government's judicial system could be divided into three periods: 14th to 17th years (of the Republic), the founding period; 18th to 24th years, the consolidation period; and 24th year to the present, the formative period. The first period was at the beginning of the revolution, and the legal system was quite incomplete. The National Government began formulating the Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code in the 17th year, but most of the old laws were still in use. The second period was the six years of political tutelage. During this period, the Civil Code was formulated, inaugurating a new era in the history of Chinese law. Other laws such as Company Law, Negotiable Instruments Law, Maritime Law, Group Contract Law, Factory Law, and Civil Procedure Law were also decided upon and promulgated for implementation, embodying the spirit of the Three Principles of the People in concrete terms. The third period involved revising important laws, such as the Criminal Code, Civil and Criminal Procedure Codes, and the Court Organization Law, all of which came into effect on July 1st of the 24th year. Following this, laws such as the Cooperative Law, Bankruptcy Law, and Land Law were also formulated or implemented successively. The Land Law particularly embodied the subtle aspects of the late Premier's land policy. The provisions of the Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code were also based on safeguarding the people's freedom and further consolidating civil rights and guaranteeing freedom. The Writ of Habeas Corpus Law was promulgated in June of the 24th year, intended to be implemented concurrently with the Constitution. Furthermore, the Judicial Yuan held a National Judicial Conference last year, resolving 400 motions. Regarding criminal matters, it repeatedly instructed all courts to pay attention to:  strictly implementing dismissal of prosecution; strictly preventing arbitrary arrests and vigorously implementing bail and surety; vigorously implementing suspended sentences and parole; vigorously implementing prison labor and work release.

<p>Earnestly Hoping for the Realization of Sino-Japanese Cooperation</p>
<p>I Believe the Japanese Side Will Not Increase Troops Again</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Tian Dai Wan'ichiro, Commander of the Japanese Garrison in Tianjin, arrived in Beiping on the 5th from Tianjin and visited Song Zheyuan and Qin Dechun, among others, merely offering routine greetings and making no mention of current events. At 8:00 AM on the 6th, Tashiro traveled to Fengtai by special train to inspect the local Japanese garrison and the construction of Japanese military barracks. Song sent Zhang Yunrong, Director of the Hebei Provincial Security Department, to accompany him. He returned to Beiping by the same train at 11:00 AM. At 12:00 PM, Zhu hosted a banquet in the east building of the Political Affairs Committee, inviting prominent Chinese and Japanese figures to attend. At that time, in front of the Political Affairs Committee, in addition to armed soldiers of the 29th Army providing security and a band providing welcome, several Japanese military police were stationed along the area inside and outside the Political Affairs Committee. Those who arrived at the appointed time included Song and Tashiro, with Matsumuro, Kawabe, and Iida representing the Japanese side, and Qin Dechun, Zhang Zizhong, Liu Ruming, Chen Zhongfu, Chen Juesheng, Xiong Shaohao, and the president of the Chamber of Commerce, Zou Quansun, representing the Chinese side. The atmosphere was convivial, and the gathering dispersed around 1:00 PM, with everyone in high spirits. At 3:00 PM, Tashiro met with reporters at the Fusang Hall. At 7:00 PM, the Japanese embassy hosted a reception for prominent figures from the Beiping municipality. At 8:00 AM on the 7th, Tashiro traveled to Tongxian by special train to inspect the local Japanese troops. He returned to Beiping at 11:00 AM and took the Beiping-Tianjin Express back to Tianjin at 5:00 PM. The following is a record of Tashiro's remarks:</p>
<p>"Since assuming my post, it has only been a little over a month. My arrival in Beiping was to formally visit Chairman Song and the members of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, and it was also our first time meeting. Therefore, I have no deep feelings. However, based on my observations thus far, if I am not mistaken, my impression is that the Hebei-Chahar Political Authority, judging from the current situation, can gradually become consolidated, and the people of North China can live and work in peace. Regarding Sino-Japanese relations, I earnestly hope that cooperation can be realized and that the economy of North China can be developed. However, Ambassador Kawagoe has not yet discussed this matter with me, and I am unable to make predictions about the future economic development policy at this time, which will have to wait for the future. The main reason for Japan increasing its garrison troops in North China is due to the threat of the Communist Party in North China. The total number of garrison troops currently stationed is over 4,000, which is sufficient. Rumors that troops will be increased again are unfounded. When the current garrison troops were increased, various rumors arose. I hope that everyone will not be misled by rumors. As for the anti-communist issue, the Japanese side has not concluded an agreement with the Chinese government." At this point, when asked why Japanese troops were gradually increasing while troops from other countries were withdrawing, Tashiro replied that this was a matter internal to each country and that he was not aware of the reasons. He continued that the missions of Major General Tokuhisa and Major General Kita Seiichi were not the same. Major General Tokuhisa was the former Chief of Staff of the North China Garrison Army and is a military man familiar with Europe and America. His visit was to inspect the situation in North and South China, and after arriving in Beiping, he will also inspect South China. Major General Kita, on the other hand, had wished to contact me once since assuming his new post in Nanjing, as it was quite relevant to official duties, so he took the time to come north. However, their simultaneous arrival in the north was not pre-arranged but a chance encounter. Furthermore, Tashiro expressed satisfaction with the resolution of the Fengtai military horse incident. Regarding the case of the Japanese national Sasaki being beaten to death by a British soldier, he said that it fell under the jurisdiction of the embassy and was not within the scope of the garrison army, so he would not express an opinion. However, he could say that the general public in Japan was quite dissatisfied with this issue. (6th)</p>
<h3>Luotong Highway Approaching Completion</h3>
<p>Total Length Over 300 Kilometers</p>
<p>Total Cost Exceeds Two Million</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: The roadbed earthwork for the western Henan Luotong Highway was completed on schedule long ago. However, because the road passes through overlapping mountains and the project is arduous, construction is difficult and a large number of laborers have been conscripted. According to investigations, the road is over 300 kilometers long. Conscription for construction began in July of the 23rd year (of the Republic) and the entire road was completed by the end of the 24th year. However, because bridge culvert materials were shipped from abroad and could not be fully delivered to the construction site at one time, bridge construction was delayed until this month to be completed. In total, it took 26 months, costing over two million yuan, conscripting over 40,000 laborers, costing four million labor days, building over four million cubic meters of earthwork, excavating 277,700+ cubic meters of stone, constructing 54 bridges, 144 culverts, 349 water pipes, and 17 river crossing paths. All of these are expected to be fully completed by the end of this month. In the future, passage will be unimpeded, not only benefiting education, culture, military affairs, and politics, but also benefiting agricultural products, industrial and commercial goods.

<h3>Chaozhou Customs Tightens Anti-Smuggling Efforts</h3>
<p>Chaozhou Customs Issues New Regulations for Baggage Declaration Forms</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Armed Japanese smugglers escorting smuggled goods into the Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Shantou areas of southern China have been proceeding unimpeded, to the point of being inescapable. Starting this month, this smuggling organization, with the assistance of a certain colonial society and military and political forces, has united the smuggling organizations of Shantou, Xiamen, and Fuzhou, resulting in an exceptionally strong capital base. It has sixty or seventy electric boats and fishing boats dedicated to smuggling. It has a fleet to provide support at sea and is equipped with new, sharp armed escorts. Quiet locations along the Fujian and Guangdong coasts have been established as wharves and warehouses for storing goods, using coastal fishermen from Nan'ao and impoverished lower-class masses as pawns. When large quantities of goods are transported from foreign ports, these people, under the direction of the Japanese, act as agents for lighterage and unloading, transferring them to branch offices in the interior, and then handing them over to retail shops for retail sales. The smuggling ship organization is tight, communicating with private goods agencies everywhere at any time using wireless telegraphy. It is not easy for customs and anti-smuggling teams to intercept, and even if they are intercepted, there is no way to deal with them. Previously, a certain vessel was seized in the Nan'ao sea area. When it was towed back to the customs house, guards were dispatched to watch over it, but the customs guards were disarmed and taken to Kaohsiung. The Chaozhou-Meizhou anti-smuggling office intercepted a boat carrying smuggled rice and beans in Chaoan, and when it was escorted to Shantou, it was hijacked by armed Japanese. The government has no other option but to issue protests. Last month, customs inspectors, together with police, attempted to search the Lianfa Trading Company in Shantou but were stopped by the Japanese consul, who said that if the Chinese government wants to search the shops and residences of Japanese nationals, it must first obtain sufficient evidence and send a document to the Japanese consul three days in advance, to be effective only with the permission of the consul and the dispatch of Japanese police to assist. Customs had no choice. Armed Japanese rampaging in Chaozhou and Shantou has become commonplace today. The government continues to make every effort to prevent smuggling, with customs increasing the number of inspectors by thirty and a team of armed customs guards, as well as multiple patrol boats, conducting inspections by land and sea day and night. When ships come to Shantou from foreign ports and are about to enter Mayu Harbor, customs inspectors approach in patrol boats and board the incoming ship to search the baggage of passengers. Anything resembling smuggling for profit, even the slightest amount, is not allowed to be brought into the country. Customs searches passengers with such rigor that many overseas Chinese returning to Shantou from distant lands, unfamiliar with customs regulations due to their long stays abroad, have items such as towels, candy, and biscuits confiscated on the ship before disembarking. After the ship docks, overseas Chinese are designated to disembark in front of the customs house, and their baggage is moved to the customs inspection factory for another thorough search before the iron gates are opened for passage. The losses suffered by returning overseas Chinese are enormous, and with no place to appeal along the way, they have submitted petitions to the Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society, requesting temporary appeals to customs to retrieve their lost items. The Mutual Aid Society then petitioned the Southwest Government, requesting thorough improvements to the treatment of returning overseas Chinese. However, in order to strictly prevent smuggled goods, customs issued a kind of</p>
<p>Baggage Declaration Form Regulation</p>
<p>This new regulation is designed to improve passenger inspection. All overseas Chinese and travelers from various places who bring baggage to Shantou must fill out the form, listing all new and old items, whether for personal use or entrusted by others. Customs will check against the list upon inspection. Taxable items must be taxed on the spot, and nothing should be omitted. Otherwise, once discovered, the items will be confiscated, but may be redeemed at a future valuation. Passengers arriving in Shantou from Shanghai and Hong Kong must also fill out the form. When ships enter the port, customs officers boarding the ship outside Mayu Harbor will only recognize whether or not each person has a baggage declaration form. If the form has not been filled out, regardless of the reason, it will be treated as smuggling, confiscated by customs, and even if there is a certificate from an overseas Chinese organization with an official seal, it cannot be used to facilitate tax payment and release. This regulation has not yet been approved and announced, but it is expected to be implemented around August 1st.</p>
<p>Agricultural Products Bureau Inspection Site</p>
<p>The Chaozhou-Meizhou Special Tax Bureau for Agricultural Products from Foreign Ports has a wide scope of tax collection, including foreign rice, beans, bean oil, foreign paper, dyes, wood, seafood, old newspapers, rubber tires, foreign wax, luxury goods, manufactured goods, foreign textiles, etc. All items taxed by customs are also subject to this tax, and items not taxed by customs are also subject to a donation tax. The tax rate is even higher than that of customs. Shantou is treated as having two layers of customs. However, merchants only have the obligation to pay taxes and have no room for debate. In the past, whenever the government monopolized cement, white sugar, tobacco leaves, or added surcharges to soybean cake, the merchants in those industries would often issue objections or appeals. Throughout history, no tax or donation proposed by the government has been revoked due to popular appeal. People know that appeals are meaningless, so taxes have become heavier in recent times, and people have remained silent. The income of the Agricultural Tax Bureau in Chaozhou and Shantou is 1.5 million yuan per month, a truly considerable sum. However, seeing the high income of the Agricultural Tax Bureau, the Japanese, citing commercial treaties, object to multiple taxes on one item. For goods monopolized by the government and goods subject to special taxes, the smuggling organization smuggles them in large quantities without paying agricultural taxes. As a result, the government has established land and water anti-smuggling offices in Chaozhou and Shantou, dispatching five or six hundred tax police, distributed throughout the area. When ships enter Shantou, tax police guard the streets and alleys along the coast. After passengers have passed through two inspections by customs, they are searched by anti-smuggling soldiers once they leave customs, with the luggage being searched even more strictly than by customs. After the tax police finish their inspection and the luggage is carried to the entrance of the street, there are inspectors from the Agricultural Products Bureau searching again along the way. The people suffer from this. However, the smuggled goods of the Japanese pass straight through, as if entering an uninhabited area. The East District Office held a meeting last month where the anti-smuggling director, Zeng Zhennan, and the director of the Agricultural Products Bureau argued over the unified authority to combat smuggling. Both sides have asked the finance department for instructions. This month, the finance department reiterated the unification order, instructing special commissioners of various tax bureaus to only monitor from the sidelines when discovering smuggled goods and to report to the anti-smuggling office for arrest. At the same time, the Agricultural Tax Bureau was ordered by the finance department to establish an inspection site in Shantou, as requested. The location has been rented at No. 341 Waima Road behind the Customs House and inspection began on June 25th.</p>
<h3>Nanjings Small Loan Program Results</h3>
<p>As of the End of June this Year</p>
<p>Total Number of Borrowers Exceeded 18,000</p>
<p>Total Loan Amount Exceeded 430,000</p>
<p>Nanjing Correspondence: The Nanjing Municipal Government has implemented a small loan program to provide relief to small-scale agricultural, industrial, and commercial businesses, as well as the poor. The details of its implementation have been reported previously. The following is a summary of its results:</p>
<p>As of the end of June of this year, the total number of borrowers in the Nanjing small loan program was 18,842, with a total loan amount of 430,285.70 yuan. The total amount recovered was 280,515.80 yuan. A comparison by loan usage reveals that the borrowers are engaged in over 200 types of businesses. Among them, the organized groups include the Gengniu Association of various rural districts, the Hualun Machinery Industry Cooperative, and the Xinhua Carriage Cooperative. The rest are individual borrowers. The individual borrowers' business scopes are larger, such as rice, charcoal, general merchandise, shoes, hats, silk fabrics, medicinal materials, silk, tea, oil, salt, candy, cigarettes, groceries, woodenware, stationery, printing, wine, restaurants, hardware, porcelain, kiln products, and other shops. These account for a smaller number of borrowers but larger loan amounts. Then there are small restaurants, rattan and bamboo products, carpentry, tailoring, barbershops, brush and ink shops, etc. Next are agriculture, family handicrafts, artisans, peddlers, hawkers, and various street vendors. The loan amounts for these are mostly between one and twenty yuan. These borrowers are mostly poor, accounting for 78% of the total number of borrowers. Looking at the various types of loans, industrial loans account for 1,256 borrowers, with a loan amount of 65,608 yuan and a recovery amount of 37,930 yuan. Commercial loans account for 4,864 borrowers, with a loan amount of 289,993 yuan and a recovery amount of 187,401 yuan. These industrial and commercial borrowers are mostly scattered in urban areas. There are also loans for the poor, specifically designed to provide relief to the extremely poor. Each household is limited to a loan of five yuan, to be repaid in five months without interest. This accounts for 7,249 borrowers, with a total loan amount of 36,181 yuan and a recovery amount of 28,719 yuan. Agricultural loans account for 5,473 borrowers, with a total loan amount of 38,503.70 yuan and a recovery amount of 26,465.70 yuan. This type of loan includes both loans for plowing oxen and loans for seeds. Loans for plowing oxen were released in January of the 24th year, because the rural areas had poor harvests in the autumn of the previous year and coincided with the Lunar New Year, making it difficult for farmers to survive. Many sold their plowing oxen. The municipal government, recognizing that plowing oxen were crucial to the livelihood of farmers, felt it necessary to provide relief and allocated 25,000 yuan specifically for loans secured by plowing oxen. A loan of ten to twenty yuan could be obtained for each ox. Seed loans were released in April of the 24th year, because farmers were unable to purchase rice seeds after the disaster. The municipal government raised another 15,000 yuan specifically for seed loans. The loan amount was determined by the amount of farmland and actual need, with the lowest loan being 40 cents. Both of these loans were of a temporary nature. Since the expansion of the small loan program to include agricultural loans, they have been completed separately. In the future, all rural loans, whether used for buying plowing oxen, seeds, tools, fertilizer, or other secondary occupations, such as beekeeping, silkworms, pigs, fish, and animal husbandry, will be collectively referred to as agricultural loans.</p>
<p>Combining the above four types of loans for agriculture, industry, commerce, and the poor, the total capital is 200,800 yuan. Averaging the number of borrowers and the loan amount, each household receives just over 22 yuan. Statistics on household members and employees show that the largest number of people is over 20, while the smallest number is two, averaging around eight people. Therefore, the number of people directly benefiting from the loans is likely in the tens of thousands. Loans in the Xiaoling, Yanziji, and Shangxinhe districts account for almost half of the households in the entire rural district, meaning that one in every two households has borrowed, demonstrating the program's widespread reach.</p>
<p>As for the benefits to citizens after the implementation of the loan program, according to investigations and collected facts from various sources, stores such as Huang Kuiwen's store in the seventh district (Xiaguan) were on the verge of collapse but were saved by the loan program. The Minde Family Industrial Cooperative (making paste) gradually improved its business with the help of the loan program. It now employs three workers and has developed from a family handicraft business into a small-scale factory industry. The Li Qingyou family started as peddlers, struggling to make ends meet. After receiving a loan, they first set up a small stall and then opened a small shop. In one year, in addition to supporting the livelihood of the entire family of four, they have now saved nearly 100 yuan in working capital. The two shops of Jing Youcai and Sun Deqing relied on usurious loans to survive. After receiving loans, their business has flourished, feeling as if a heavy burden has been lifted. Dong Zhengwen and Xia Yongliang, among others, were able to become self-sufficient and avoid starvation thanks to the loan program. There are many similar cases. The small loan program directly provides practical relief to citizens and maintains their livelihoods, and indirectly reduces the number of unemployed people in society, thereby invisibly eliminating factors of social disorder. It can be said that it is the most effective project. Furthermore, before the implementation of the small loan program, loan conditions in Nanjing, not to mention high-interest usurious loans, were such that the interest rates of ordinary banks were also higher than those of the small loan program by a multiple. After the implementation of the small loan program, the difference in benefits between borrowers is like heaven and earth. Therefore, the small loan program is truly a social undertaking that benefits the people and the country.</p>
<h3>Kunshan Public Security Bureau Kills Stray Dogs</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau is holding dog registration. Since it began on May 1st, over 300 dogs have been registered. With the deadline now passed, the police have been dispatched in recent days with large iron cages to catch stray dogs everywhere, killing them all to eliminate future problems. It is said that registration of dogs in all districts and townships will also be held next month.</p>
<h3>Inspecting Rice Varieties</h3>
<p>Over 300 acres of improved rice varieties promoted this year were inspected by personnel from the National Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute, who found them satisfactory. It is now learned that the institute has instructed the county to conduct an inspection of rice varieties. The county government has determined that representatives from the Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute, the Agricultural College of Central University, the county magistrate, the district chiefs, and sixteen farmers with rich agricultural experience will form an inspection committee to be responsible for handling the matter. The committee is scheduled to be established in the middle of the month and will begin planning immediately.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Xu Zhixin Case Judgement</h3>
<p>Xu Zhixin, the former president of the Jiangdu District Court, was suspended from his post last winter. He was accused of unclear handover of responsibilities and embezzlement of public funds. After investigation by the Zhenjiang District Court Procuratorate, he was publicly prosecuted for dereliction of duty and embezzlement. The Criminal Court has now concluded its hearing and rendered a judgment the other day. The main text reads: "Xu Zhixin, for the purpose of directly benefiting from matters under his jurisdiction, jointly and continuously, is sentenced to one year of imprisonment. The total of 2,026.29 yuan in benefits obtained from the crime is to be confiscated." Xu declared his disagreement with the judgement and must file an appeal with the Fifth High Branch Court.</p>
<h3>Resolutely Opposing the Estimated Business Tax</h3>
<p>Shops in Suzhou generally believe that the Wuxian Business Tax Bureau's estimation of the amount of tax payable by each shop is unrealistic, with differences of up to tenfold or more. Therefore, they have unanimously expressed their opposition and do not recognize the estimated bills as valid. It is now learned that the Wuxian Chamber of Commerce, which is organized by merchants from various industries, has, in view of the above situation, recognized that the tax bureau is deliberately harassing merchants and that businesses are unable to bear the burden during this time of business decline. Therefore, it convened a general meeting of members at the North Bureau Association Hall at 5:00 PM on the 8th. Under the chairmanship of Mr. Fan Junbo, it was unanimously decided to resolutely oppose and deny the estimated bills and the examination of shop accounts, and to not stop until the goal is achieved. Director Feng of the Business Tax Bureau is currently in contact with President Cheng of the Chamber of Commerce to avoid causing disputes.</p>
<h3>Haimen Old Woman Driven Mad by Search for Son</h3>
<p>Ji Youxiang, a resident of Zhonghonggang, Haimen, went out to do business four years ago and has not returned since, with no news arriving home. His mother, who is in her seventies, manages the family and shop affairs alone. Out of worry and anxiety, she has become mentally ill. Regardless of who she meets on the road, she cries and asks them where her son is, grabbing their clothes and refusing to let go. Passersby find her very pitiful. Recently, gentry Cai Zhiying and others in the county have been widely posting notices to search for her son to return home to help her.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Complete Library Arrives</h3>
<p>Following the "Anecdotes of Yangzhou" case, another large box of Complete Library, fined from the China Book Bureau for publishing, arrived in Yangzhou from Shanghai the other day. Together with the books that arrived the first time, they have been temporarily stored in the Education Bureau. Once the entire set is complete, a suitable place will be selected for storage, allowing anyone to browse them.</p>
<h3>Nantong Bandit Arrested in Northern Township</h3>
<p>Liu Ziyun, a well-known bandit in the northern township of Tong County, committed numerous crimes. Although the military and police had been pursuing him, he had not been caught. Recently, a thorough cleaning of the township was implemented. The bandit was apprehended by the security team in Liuqiao and taken to the district security command for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Postal Service for Litigation Documents</h3>
<p>The Nantong District Court, under orders to deliver litigation documents via postal service starting this month, has designated the following areas for delivery due to the limited availability of post offices: Tangzha, Pingchao, Jinsha, Erjiazhen, Haifuzhen, Shigang, and Baiman, totaling eight locations.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Planned Mining of Changshan Coal Mine</h3>
<p>The Construction Department recently sent personnel to investigate Changshan County in eastern Zhejiang, where a coal mine is located more than ten miles from the county seat. The estimated coal reserves are 400,000 tons. After testing, the coal quality is deemed better than Changxing coal and suitable for use in various factories. Active mining efforts are underway, with the necessary funds, 10,000 yuan, borrowed from the Zhejiang Local Bank with a provincial government guarantee. The mined coal will be transported by waterway. Factoring in labor costs and freight charges, the selling price is estimated at eight yuan and eight jiao per ton, which is considerably lower than current market prices. The Construction Department is currently drafting a comprehensive contract for construction, transportation, and sales, and plans to repay the 10,000 yuan loan from the surplus. An administrative office will be established for management purposes.</p>
<h3>Huzhou: Security Forces Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>Hu Luduan, commander of the 14th Battalion of the Huzhou Security Force, recently received a telegram from Li Gongxia, the magistrate of Anji County, stating that 200-300 bandits had suddenly appeared in the border area between the county and Huanghe, Anhui Province, causing disturbances along the county's border. He requested immediate deployment of troops to suppress the bandits. Upon receiving the report, Commander Hu immediately dispatched over a hundred soldiers from the first, second, third, and fourth companies, personally leading them to suppress the bandits. They encountered the bandits about twenty li from Dipu. A firefight ensued, lasting for two hours. The bandits were overwhelmed and fled towards Xiaofeng Huanglong Mountain. Over twenty bandits were killed on the spot, and over ten were captured alive. Commander Hu dispatched personnel to escort the captured bandits to Huzhou yesterday. The commander is currently leading the soldiers in the continued suppression effort.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Southern Tour</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Shi Ying</p>
<p>The Past and Present of Zhejiang's Products</p>
<p>The natural environment within Zhejiang is divided by the Qiantang River. The area west of the Qiantang River, including Hangzhou and Jiaxing, is called Western Zhejiang. The land is flat and fertile, producing abundant silk and food. The majority of the area east of the Qiantang River is collectively called Eastern Zhejiang, which is further divided into two regions. The area from the Qiantang River to the Ou River, including Shaoxing, Yin County, Linhai, and Yongjia, is the coastal zone, characterized by numerous mountains and limited farmland, but rich in fishery and salt resources. The area upstream of the Qiantang River and the Ou River, including Jiande, Jinhua, Lishui, and Qu County, is the mountainous region. The mountains are steep and the soil is barren, with timber and tea as the main products. In the past, the atmosphere was very closed off. Now, due to the successive openings of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and various highways, there has been a significant improvement in culture.</p>
<p>Among Zhejiang's seventy-five counties, fifty-eight count sericulture as a main sideline for farmers. Annual silk cocoon production accounts for nearly half of the nation's total silk production. The production of the counties in the Taihu Lake basin in Western Zhejiang is particularly well-known. The highest quality "Qili Silk" comes from Linghu and Nanxun towns in Wuxing (Huzhou), but there are few silk factories, with most of the silk reeled by hand by rural women. Since the 1920s, silk prices have plummeted, from over fifty yuan per dan to around twenty yuan. The lives of ordinary sericulture women have steadily declined. Du Gouhe's poem, "[Missing color entirely, only hunger remains, how can one know there's splendor in the world? Every year I'm told silkworms are laborious, what is the reason for wearing hemp clothes all over one's body?]" is a fitting portrayal of their lives. In the past two years, the silk industry has shown signs of recovery. The authorities have begun to use scientific methods, advocating the use of improved breeds, experimenting with electric sericulture, and engaging in silk cocoon control, hoping to use this to restore the substantial profits of the Zhejiang silk industry, which is a good intention. However, at the beginning of implementation, one must guard against being too hasty to avoid causing resentment among farmers, such as in one place where forced sales of improved breeds occurred. In the first place, running these undertakings of a rescue nature for the rural economy must truly have a spirit of sacrifice, and in practice avoid putting one's own rice bowl on the shoulders of the farmers. In this way, the dying sericulture industry will have the power to counter the dumping of Japanese rayon.</p>
<p>Those who like to enjoy tea in teahouses or often frequent tea shops must have long known about the famous "Longjing tender buds," which are a specialty of Hangzhou. However, Zhejiang's tea exports are mostly "Pingshui Tea" from the Shaoxing area. The green tea exported from Hangzhou mostly comes from Tunxi, Anhui. Even the Longjing tea bought in West Lake, it's hard to say it is not using fish eyes to mix with pearls. In addition, Yongjia produces black tea, but the quantity is not large. In recent years, the market of Chinese tea in international trade has unfortunately been gradually seized by Japanese tea. Also, some countrymen who are obsessed with foreign styles like to drink imported coffee beverages, and do not hesitate to relegate the domestic superior beverage, Longjing, to a cold palace. This way, to be sure, it is partly leaking the economy of the Zhejiang tea industry, and at the same time compatriots who love to use foreign goods are dismantling their own stage.</p>
<p>Traveling through the mountainous regions of Eastern Zhejiang, the lush green forests are mostly villages of pine, fir, cypress, and poplar. Timber merchants buy these timbers cheaply (a fir tree two or three zhang high in Jiangshan sells for only about one jiao each), compile them into rafts, and float them down the Qiantang River to Zhakou in Hangzhou, where they are distributed to Western Zhejiang and the Suzhou-Wuxi area. Annual production has reached over 10 million yuan. In recent years, due to the increased use of foreign pine and steel-reinforced concrete in buildings, the sales of Zhejiang timber have declined significantly. On the one hand, due to the poverty of the people, they have no choice but to kill the goose to get the egg, and the many young forest trees that have not yet grown into timber are destroyed in the dinging sound of axes, only to be used as fuel. Looking at the Qiantang River, although it is still flowing endlessly, the timber rafts that once filled the river are becoming increasingly difficult to sustain. Fortunately, there are many forests in Eastern Zhejiang, and new forests will naturally grow even without planting in the future. If we only add human protection (and of course also consider planting), then this patchwork, tattered outer garment of the mountains will surely become a seamless, green, modern outfit.</p>
<p>Fisheries in the coastal zone are affected by Japanese fishing boats fishing across borders, Jinhua's ham faces new competition from the Jiangsu Jiangbei Ham Company, and Shaoxing wine and paper making in various counties have lost their major sales outlets in the Northeast provinces due to the September 18th Incident. In short, everything is "depressed". However, tung oil produced in counties such as Jiande and Jinhua has made an unexpected fortune since last year. The cotton-producing areas on both sides of Hangzhou Bay, especially the "Yao Hua" produced in Yuyao, are very promising. Changxing's coal mines have excellent quality, but have not been developed on a large scale, causing the coal used for the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to be transported from afar from North China. Fortunately, when the Nanchang-Pingxiang Railway is completed, this problem can be solved. This matter is not only related to Zhejiang's fuel issue, so I hope that the authorities will speed up the process.</p>
<p>Taking the Zhejiang-Jiangxi train from Hangzhou to Eastern Zhejiang, one first crosses the Qiantang River. It was the rising tide season, the river surface was four or five li wide, and looking at the mighty waves on the dock, it was very similar to the ferry at Pukou, Nanjing, but the depth and flow rate here were ultimately much lower than the Yangtze River. There is a very long dock on each side of the Qiantang River ferry, extending to the great slip edge in the river, and then it is crossed by boat. The Jiangxi dock, commonly known as the Yang Bridge, is a thousand steps long, with a steel-armed concrete roof, and walking through it is very similar to the promenade of the Summer Palace in Beiping. The pedestrians coming and going here are travelers carrying suitcases and holding walking sticks, footmen stepping in harmonious and solid steps, and two-person sedan chairs carrying the ancient fragrance. I myself am in their ranks, and with the sound of rushing water coming up, I feel very excited. Taking a boat and looking at the waves, the water flow is very fast. The caissons put down to build the Qiantang River Bridge, weighing 500 tons, were washed away. It is a pity that it flowed into the mouth of Hangzhou Bay, and there is the obstacle of the Biezi Gate. From the sea to the river, only sailing ships can pass, not sea-going vessels. The Qiantang River Bridge Construction Office is ten li away from the ferry, and nothing can be seen. The completion date of the Jin Bridge is probably in two years. Later, boarding the dock in Jiangdong, which is made of wooden beams, and exposed to the sky, it happened to be raining, and everyone ran with their heads in their arms. Could this be a symbol that Eastern Zhejiang is more bitter than Western Zhejiang? Running to the station, the air was very silent, and many monsters waiting to be transported were piled up on the platform, and some were even left by merchants, and they sighed, as if saying: We are born with a copper tendon iron ribs, with the power to shake the world, but we can't eat the flesh of the Hu captives when hungry, or drink the blood of the Xiongnu when thirsty, and now we are going to "that"! What can I do?</p>
<p>Although the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has only been open for more than half a year (the Hangzhou-Jiangshan section opened in 1934), the treatment of employees is only half of that of other railways, but the spirit of rectitude among the staff is generally rare. It takes 24 hours to go from Hangzhou to Nanchang, and third-class cars also sell sleeper berths at night, with the upper berth costing one yuan and the lower berth costing one and a half yuan, which is considered cheap. Other advanced railways often run for more than two days and nights, only selling first- and second-class sleepers. It seems that they should condescend to imitate the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which is a rising star, and do good deeds for third-class passengers. In fact, the business income of passenger cars on various roads is usually better for third class than for first and second class. And the people who take the first and second class are sometimes mostly free tickets or half-price tickets, or even driving cold empty cars. Third-class passengers are often overcrowded, and it is a matter of reason and affection to think of an economical and comfortable way for them. In addition, the design of the Yupu section of the road did not borrow talent from foreign countries, and various buildings did not beg for mercy from foreign merchants. The materials used were also made of domestic products as much as possible, and surprisingly good results were obtained. In addition, the Qiantang River Bridge Construction Office, considering the immensity of this bridge project and the novelty of the technology, specially recruited graduates from the civil engineering departments of various universities to practice at the construction office, and twenty people have been promoted to practice engineers. There are also eighty or ninety long-term interns, and the results are very impressive. All of these can increase the confidence of Chinese people in their abilities, and the way out for Chinese talent will gradually release the dawn.</p>
<p>After several rings of the bell, the whistle sounded, and the train slowly started, and the god of the sky also showed a smile. After a while, it will be Xiaoshan, whose city wall is half built on the plain and half climbing on the mountain, which looks a bit like the Great Wall. Five or six li southwest of the city, there is a thirty-li circumference of Xiang Lake, which was built by Song Yang Guishan to build water conservancy and abandon farmland. The lake is shaped like a gourd, surrounded by mountains, and there is a Huawu Bridge in the center of the lake, similar to the Jade Belt Bridge of Longevity Mountain in the old capital. The lake also produces water shield and soil-step fish, which taste very delicious. At this time, it is the season when farmers are "finishing the silkworm leaves and then inserting the fields," so in the paddy fields near the railway, some of the rice seedlings have turned green, and some are still busy inserting the seedlings. Qing Chen Kui has a poem that says, "Dividing the seedlings, dividing the seedlings must be done in time, the low fields are inserted first, the high fields are delayed, turning the eyes to the west wind, the rice flowers are in bloom, the yellow clouds are piled up on the thatched cottages." How happy is this? However, the reason is in the same poem, "In recent years, the annual harvest is good and the official rent is cheap." And in the first few sentences of "The rent collectors do not alarm the people," I am afraid that the farmers who are inserting rice seedlings under the scorching sun now may not have that kind of freehand brushwork!</p>

<h3>Central Committee Member Staying in Shanghai Went to Beijing Last Night: Hu Wencan Expresses Opinions on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>The Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee will open tomorrow. In addition to those who have already gone to Beijing, those who took the 11:00 pm night train to Beijing last night included Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Control Yuan Xu Chongzhi, Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu, Cai Yuanpei, Zhu Jiqing, Xue Dubi, Zhang Zhiben, Chen Qingyun, Cheng Tiangu, Luo Yiqun, Hu Wencan, Wu Jingxiong, etc. It is heard that Zhang Dingfan did not travel with them last night because he was waiting to meet with the representatives from the Southwest. Yang Shukan, Xie Chi, and He Shizhen have asked for leave due to illness or other matters and will not be able to attend. Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Council, Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of this city, and Pan Gongzhan, the director of the education bureau of this city, are scheduled to go there today.</p>
<p>According to Hu Wencan, a member of the Central Committee who recently came to Shanghai from Guangdong, he expressed his views on the current situation, advocating the concentration of national strength to save the country. He said that the national situation has now reached the most critical level. It is still feared that it will not be enough to fight against people with all the strength of the country, so how can two or three people advocating resistance against Japan be helpful? What's more, the Japanese are adopting a policy of using Chinese to control Chinese. Now that this kind of accident has happened, it is just right for the Japanese to poison the plan. Hu also said that before Hu Hanmin's death, he also knew about this decision on the affairs of Guangdong and Guangxi, and his spirit was quite stimulated. The reason why Zou Haibin left Guangdong was also related to this matter. When Zou left Guangdong, he had strongly advised the leaders of the Southwest not to split themselves, and advocated that all parties and factions in the country should abandon their opinions, concentrate their strength to deal with Japan. Zou's ambition has not changed so far. Hu also said that at this point in the situation, it is necessary to do everything possible to avoid civil war, so that we can preserve the country's vitality, and the central government's political and military orders must be unified, subordinates should absolutely obey their superiors, and local areas should sincerely obey the central government, so as to strengthen the power of the central government. This is the necessary condition for saving the country. Therefore, he extremely hoped that the leaders of the Southwest could unite in adversity and put forward all their opinions at this session of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee to jointly discuss a definite plan to save the country.</p>

<h3>The Social Affairs Bureau Stabilizes Market Prices: The Wheat Flour Price Increase Subsides</h3>
<p>Regulations Stipulate Standard Futures Prices to Be Implemented</p>
<p>The Wheat Flour Market Opened as Usual Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Wheat Flour Exchange experienced several stoppages, the market resumed normal trading yesterday afternoon after the Social Affairs Bureau limited the standard prices, and the market price has stabilized. The reporter of the Xin Xin News Agency recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Stabilized Market Prices Yesterday: The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau issued an order to the Wheat Flour Exchange yesterday, limiting the standard market prices. The order stated that the recent increase in the market price of wheat flour has been abnormal, affecting the people's food supply, which is not a minor matter. The bureau previously received requests from Li Zhian, Wang Zichun, and others to stop it in order to maintain the people's food supply. The bureau has sent personnel to investigate the matter. According to the report, the spot market price of wheat flour before the 4th of this month was 2.9 yuan, while the closing price of the current month's futures on the 6th of the same month reached 3.11075 yuan, with a difference of more than 2 jiao per bag of wheat flour. Moreover, after checking the accounts of various brokers, it was found that there were many non-industry people with huge long positions, which is suspected of manipulating the people's food supply. After investigation, the difference between the spot price and the futures price of wheat flour in the exchange is too large, and it is obvious that speculators are manipulating the market, which is very wrong. In order to stabilize market prices, the bureau has specifically determined the highest price to be 3.05 yuan based on the average price of each session from the opening to the closing of the current month's futures on the 6th of this month. The same number shall be used for the next three months of July, August, and September. For the three months of October, November, and December, the price shall be increased by 3 fen per month according to the past market conditions, that is, 3.08 yuan, 3.11 yuan, and 3.14 yuan. All buying and selling market prices shall not exceed the above-mentioned price limits for the time being, in order to stabilize prices and maintain the people's food supply. The exchange shall immediately comply with this order, and shall report the actual increase in spot prices in the future for approval. This order is hereby issued.</p>
<p>The Wheat Flour Market Announced Compliance: After receiving the order, the Wheat Flour Exchange immediately posted Announcement No. 62 in the market, saying that the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau's Order No. 6502 must be complied with by buyers and sellers in this market. Those whose prices exceed the limited prices will not be registered in the market accounts. In addition to recording the original order (see above), this announcement is hereby issued. July 8th.</p>
<p>The Market Opened in the Afternoon and the Price Stabilized: After receiving the Social Affairs Bureau's order transferred by the exchange, the Wheat Flour Exchange Brokers Association convened a general meeting of all brokers at the exchange's fifth floor at 11:00 am yesterday to exchange opinions. It was resolved that it would be implemented in accordance with the resolution. After the meeting, it was already 1:00 pm, so the market only resumed trading at 12:30 pm yesterday. The opening and closing prices were the same as the standard prices set by the Social Affairs Bureau, so they are not recorded again. Therefore, the panic of the wheat flour price increase has come to an end.</p>
<p>Wheat Flour Sales to the North Become Active: The production and sales of wheat flour in Shanghai and Wuxi have always relied on various places in North China. In recent years, due to special influences, sales to the north have sharply decreased. The wheat flour factories that rely on the north as the terminal for production and sales have suffered considerable losses. According to news from the grain industry, since the summer, the sales of food in various places in North China have become active, and foreign grain merchants have been eager to come to Shanghai to purchase. In the past week, the quantity of wheat flour shipped north from Shanghai, excluding Qingdao, Yantai, Weihaiwei, and other ports, reached as much as 200,000 bags in Tianjin alone, which is a phenomenon that has only occurred in recent years. Within this week, the Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships heading to Tianjin will be loaded with more than 60,000 bags. However, it is not only wheat flour that is in demand, but also rice and other grains. Xiangnan Qi Yong Commerce Resumes: Started to Cable Shanghai for Goods</p>

<p>Typhoon Warning First Issued to Shanghai and Other Coastal Radio Stations</p>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation Seeks Navigation Safety and Consults with the Meteorological Research Institute, Ordering the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau to Notify</p>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation, after consulting with the Central Meteorological Research Institute, has decided that from June 1st to the end of October, when a typhoon warning is issued, a separate telegram will be sent to the coastal radio stations in Shanghai and other places. Yesterday, the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau was instructed to notify this. It is noted that during the typhoon season, coastal ships' radio stations may not be able to receive the hurricane warnings broadcast by the Central Meteorological Research Institute due to distance. In order to ensure navigation safety, the Ministry has consulted with the Central Meteorological Research Institute, and from June 1st to the end of October, when a typhoon warning is issued, in addition to the usual broadcast, a telegram will also be sent to the coastal radio stations in Shanghai, Fuzhou, Yantai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other five locations. Each radio station will follow Article 22 of the International Radiotelegraph Convention, and automatically send a warning signal by first transmitting twelve long dashes, separated by two minutes, and then sending the typhoon warning. In addition to separate orders, this order is hereby issued for notification and to inform all relevant ships' radio stations. This order is issued by Yu Zhenpeng, Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Transportation, acting on behalf of the minister.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Cocoon Association Petitions Zhejiang Provincial Government to Return Excessively Collected Fresh Cocoon Improvement Fees</p>
<p>Fees Levied This Time Were All Due to Immature Drying; Should Order the Sericulture Association to Refund the Full Amount Promptly</p>
<p>The Shanghai Aiwen Road Zhejiang Sericulture Trade Association United Association sent a document to Huang Shaohong, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, stating that the unauthorized fees are illegal and that the excess amount should be refunded in full to uphold the law and relieve merchants' difficulties. On June 21st of this year, the association held a meeting of cocoon industry members at the Taoshi Chamber of Commerce. Hangxian Zhenye Cocoon Firm reported that they had collected eleven types of fresh cocoons, totaling 1,668 dan and 34 jin, with an improvement fee of 1,001 yuan. Due to immature drying, they were forced to pay 1,074 yuan and 54 fen, resulting in an excess collection of 73 yuan and 54 fen. Yuhang Zhongxing Cocoon Firm reported that they had collected twelve types of fresh cocoons, totaling 1,752 dan and 88 jin, with an improvement fee of 1,051 yuan and 7 jiao and 3 fen. Due to immature drying, they were forced to pay 1,130 yuan and 9 fen, resulting in an excess collection of 78 yuan, 3 jiao, and 6 fen. Yuhang Xinchang Cocoon Firm collected eleven types of fresh cocoons, totaling 1,453 dan and 71 jin, with an improvement fee of 872 yuan, 2 jiao, and 3 fen. Due to immature drying, they were forced to pay 1,019 yuan and 9 jiao and 5 fen, resulting in an excess collection of 147 yuan, 7 jiao, and 2 fen. In addition, there were disputes in Wuxing, Chongde, Tongxiang, and other cocoon firms due to immature drying, or the guarantee deposits at the time of registration were not returned, resulting in various forms of unwarranted and excessive collections, which were unbearable. It is requested that the case be forwarded based on reason, and that the improvement fees forced from the cocoon firms without authorization, as well as the original guarantee deposits at the time of registration, be refunded in full to comply with the regulations and relieve merchants' difficulties. Upon review, Article 19 of the Zhejiang Province's "Provisional Measures for Unified Management of Cocoon Collection in the Current Spring Season" stipulates that silk merchants who have been approved to collect cocoons should pay two types of fees to the association. The second type is that each dan of local fresh cocoons should pay an improvement fee of six jiao, and each dan of improved fresh cocoons should pay a species fee and an improvement fee of one yuan and eight jiao. According to the fee payment standard, it is clearly stipulated that the fee is based on each group of fresh cocoons. Furthermore, after the species amount and improvement fee in the following paragraph are paid clearly, the district offices will issue dry cocoon fee payment certificates and dry cocoon transportation certificates before transportation is allowed. There is no restriction on drying discount. Moreover, when cocoons are collected, resident staff are stationed in each firm to monitor the daily collection unit by unit, and verify the cocoon book joint tickets as evidence for collecting the improvement fee, which is detailed and without omission. However, merchants collecting cocoons wish to store some cocoons for a long time and make silk quickly, and will naturally dry them sufficiently. Those that cannot be dried sufficiently will be light when loaded and take up less space. Those who engage in sericulture all know this. Since the fee is based on fresh cocoons, whether it is immature drying or not has nothing to do with the farmers. The association's regulations for collecting fees are based on fresh cocoons, originally to avoid disputes over drying discount. However, the staff did not pay attention and collected excessively by using this as an excuse. How can merchants willingly endure such oppression? Please forward the case to the government for review and quickly instruct the Sericulture Association to investigate. According to the regulations of the current unified management of cocoon collection and the examples of cocoon merchants having immature drying price, the unauthorized improvement fees forced from various firms and the guarantee deposits withheld should be investigated and refunded to uphold the law and relieve merchants' difficulties. This would be fair. Respectfully submitted to Huang, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government.</p>
<p>Guanghe Aviation Resumes Flights Tomorrow</p>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1338: It is noted that the China Aviation Corporation's Guanghe flights were temporarily suspended, as announced in Notice No. 1325 of May 6, 1936.

The next day, it will return to Guangzhou via the original route. The airmail rates for mail sent via this route and the Hanoi Yu Masae air route will be temporarily calculated according to the rates stipulated in Notice No. 1294. However, the words "Guangzhou 2 jiao 5 fen" in the first line of the rate table in the notice should be deleted, and the words "Madagascar 1 yuan 4 jiao" in the last line should be changed to "Madagascar 1 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen." This notice is hereby issued for general information. This notice is issued by Director Zha Peilin on July 8.</p>
<p>Lu Yanghao of Chongming Presents Opinions on the Dispute Over the Shengsi Islands</p>
<p>Lu Yanghao, a gentry of Chongming, presented his opinions to the Jiangsu Provincial Government regarding the division of the Shengsi Islands to Zhejiang Province, stating that he was submitting a petition to comply with public opinion, maintain the old boundary in the division of the outer seas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and present opinions on the development of outer sea fishing areas, hoping to be adopted. He stated that the importance of the Shengsi Islands in the outer seas of Jiangsu lies in their strategic location and fishing industry. They are the gateway to the Yangtze River, the barrier to Chongbao, Jinshan, and Qingpu counties in southern Jiangsu, and the central fishing area for the outer sea fishing industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces. Therefore, in terms of strategic location, Jiangsu Province must not divide this territory. In terms of the fishing industry, the territory belongs to Jiangsu, and fishing should not be limited by provincial boundaries. The administrative affiliation should not be a point of contention. However, the Shanghai native association of Zhejiang natives, instigated by a few parasitic fishermen, proposed the division of Shengsi to Zhejiang. Lu Yanghao repeatedly cited historical facts to correct their delusions, revealed the truth, and petitioned the Ministry of Interior to maintain the division of the outer seas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in the 29th year of Kangxi. He also heard that Ge, the commissioner of the Nantong District of Jiangsu, and Zhao, the commissioner of the Ningbo District of Zhejiang, had scheduled a meeting on June 23rd in the outer seas to survey the provincial boundary, hoping that the dispute over the provincial boundary could be resolved and that Xugong Mountain and the northern part of Damao Mountain, which were occupied by Zhejiang, could be returned to Jiangsu. However, the result was that the meeting was terminated due to Commissioner Zhao's arbitrary decision. Commissioner Zhao did not first establish the principle of Shengsi's return to Zhejiang, and insisted that the meeting would not be held, claiming that it was an authority granted by the government and that he should be responsible for the termination of the meeting. Moreover, it was heard that before the meeting, Commissioner Zhao had made an appointment with Zhang Xiaogeng, Han Xiangzhou, Yuan Tisu, and many other representatives of Shanghai natives in Shanghai, and sent the Tai'an warship to various mountains in Shengsi and Huanglong to persuade the residents to return to Zhejiang, but they were all rejected. This led to the termination of the meeting. When Commissioner Ge inspected the mountains, representatives of the residents of each mountain continuously petitioned against returning to Zhejiang. The will of the people cannot be ignored. It is hoped that the case will be strongly argued based on reason, that the original boundary will be maintained in the division of the outer seas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to comfort the people, and that the Shengsi Islands have been observed by people. It is further requested that the authorities follow the established plan, vigorously improve the fishing villages and develop the fishing areas in the outer seas. Lu Yanghao is not talented but has conducted field investigations in the fishing villages in the outer seas and dares to offer his humble opinions. The opinions are listed below, hoping to be reviewed.</p>
<p>Guidance on Improving the Fishing Industry: Although the Shengsi Islands are one of the most important fishing areas in the outer seas of China, the lives of the fishermen are all below the standard of living, and the methods of fishing are still based on the old methods, resulting in low productivity. Therefore, if we want to increase the production of fishermen and enrich the economy of the fishing villages, then improvement is the only solution. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has long paid attention to the guidance of fishing industry improvement. In October of the 19th year of the Republic of China, the Provincial Government decided to establish the Jiangsu Provincial Fishery Experiment Station, but due to the time required to construct the site, an office was established in Shanghai and a fishery guidance center was established in Shengshan, specializing in the guidance and investigation of the outer sea fishing industry. Since your administration took over Jiangsu, the fishery industry in Jiangsu has received more attention. In addition to establishing the Lianyungang Aquatic Products School, the provincial budget for the 24th year also included a special fund of 20,000 yuan to construct the Fishery Experiment Medical Center in Shengshan. However, the construction has been delayed due to the unresolved boundary disputes. The current year is coming to an end, and construction has not yet begun. Shengshan is the center of the outer sea fishermen, and guidance work is easier to implement in Shengshan. Shengshan has many types of fish, which can be used for experiments, so that the experiments will not be terminated due to lack of materials. Other examples include the annual decrease in the production of mussels and seaweed. If no aquaculture plan is made, they will become extinct in a few years. The methods of reproduction are unknown to the fishermen and await the aquaculture of the Provincial Fishery Experiment Station in Shengshan. As for the improvement of the fishing villages, the experiment station must be in Shengshan to provide practical guidance in order to be effective. For example, this year, the Utilization Department of the Chongming County Fifth District Credit Purchase and Sales Utilization Guarantee Cooperative tried to improve the processing of cuttlefish. As a result, the price difference between improved and ordinary products was determined by several Shanghai seafood firms to be 20 yuan per dan (ordinary products 20 yuan per dan, improved products 40 yuan per dan). The value of fishery improvement has a significant impact on the production of fishing villages. For the convenience of fishery guidance, the Provincial Fishery Experiment Station must be moved to Shengshan as soon as possible. It is requested that the authorities order the construction office to construct the fishery experiment station in Shengshan as soon as possible according to the original budget, so that the major plan for Jiangsu's fishery industry will not be halted by meaningless boundary disputes. The outer sea fishermen are looking forward to it.</p>
<p>Protection of Fishing Villages and Fishing Grounds: The Shengsi Islands are scattered in the outer seas, and the security of the islands depends on protection. In the past, the leaders of each island were responsible for maintaining security, and they often used security guards for self-defense. The expenses were borne by the fishermen through apportionment. The fishermen were ignorant and regarded the security guards as their protectors. Once appointed by the leaders, they considered it natural. However, the security guards relied on the prestige of weapons and demanded arbitrarily from the fishermen. Therefore, the security groups in the outer seas were originally established for security, but the result was that they seemed to harass the people instead of protecting them. The apportionment of expenses was not based on standards, the burden was uneven, and there was no auditing of income and expenditure. The leaders themselves, even if they had more knowledge than the average fisherman, were still very shallow. They considered it satisfactory for the guards to be at their disposal, and they had never heard of training or education. Since the formal establishment of the Fifth District in Shengsi by Chongming in March of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the security chief has been concurrently held by the district chief, and the income and expenditure of expenses and the training of guards have been strengthened, and some progress has been made. The income and expenditure of the security group are budgeted, and the collection of donations has been unified by the Chongming County Local Donation Collection Office since the 24th year, and the guards are also trained daily. The fishing ground protection in the outer seas has been carried out by the Junhe warship in recent years, which is far better than the water police of the past. However, although the security industry in the outer seas has made progress over the years, continuous reform is still needed to ensure the safety of the fishing villages and fishing grounds. A. After Chongming County established a district in the outer seas, additional police substations were added, but due to the shortage of expenses, no success has been seen. It seems that they can be abolished and merged with the security group to change to a fishery security organization suitable for the needs of the fishing villages. B. The fishing ground is the source of the fishing industry, and for fishing ground protection, Jiangsu Province currently only has one Junhe warship, which is still insufficient. In the future, if the Haiying patrol ship can also be designated as an outer sea fishing protection patrol ship, then the sea surface will be safer. However, the duty of the patrol ship is to patrol, not to stay in the port. Strict regulations should be set for the patrol and inspection awards and punishments to avoid corruption by the patrol ship in guarding the port. C. The Jiangsu Provincial Fishery Experiment Station has a Yunyun fishing vessel, and the ship's machinery speed is the best among the existing fishing vessels in the outer seas. It travels between the fishing grounds and Shengsi, Songhu, and other places throughout the year. If weapons can be added, the fishing vessel can also have the effect of fishing protection. Furthermore, the old Jiangsu electric patrol ship is planned to be no longer repaired due to its old age. If the weapons on the electric warship are transferred to the Yunyun fishing vessel, then although the electric warship is abolished, the Yunyun warship can replace the duties of patrolling, which will greatly increase the strength of fishing protection in the outer seas. Whether the above three matters are feasible should be reviewed and discussed by the authorities and the Construction Department and Security Office.</p>
<p>Loans to Rescue Fishing Villages: According to the results of investigations by the Fifth District Office of Chongming County on the population and number of fishing boats in the Shengsi Islands, there are 4,772 households. 1,245 fishing households. 42,173 people. 11,250 males. 10,034 females. 1,679 fishing boats. 241 rowboats (mainly for catching cuttlefish). In a famous fishing area, the number of fishing households accounts for less than one-third of the total number of households, indicating the lack of fishing boats in the fishing area. According to the investigation by the Provincial Fishery Experiment Station in the 24th year, the fishing operations in Sijiao are extravagant, and 80% of the nearly 100 boats are rented. Furthermore, each pair of large boats for catching small yellow croaker costs 2,500 yuan to build, and the monthly rent is 140 yuan. Each cuttlefish trawler costs 200 yuan to build, and the rent for two months is 60 yuan. The lack of fishing boats in the fishing villages and the high interest rates for renting boats are also evident. Loans for shipbuilding should be promoted to rescue the fishing villages. In terms of the harvest of fishing boats, the statistics for the 24th year show that the best catch of large yellow croaker is more than 600 yuan per boat, but most boats earn only 200 yuan. The cuttlefish catch is about 200 yuan per boat on average (in the past, it was mostly more than 700 yuan). The Sijiao gillnet catch is more than 1,200 yuan per boat for the most, and only 500 to 600 yuan for the least. The hairtail catch is more than 800 yuan per boat for the most, and 200 to 300 yuan for the least. Therefore, one more fishing boat can increase production by at least 200 to 300 yuan, which is enough to support the livelihood of four or five fishermen. Furthermore, the fishermen's income is limited after deducting the cost of wood, and they do not know how to save money. Whenever they go fishing, they always lack capital and have to borrow from others or pre-borrow money from the fishing companies, and the interest rate is higher than that of rural loans, and there are various restrictions. In Shengsi, the monthly interest rate for gold jewelry as collateral is still 3%. Therefore, for loans without collateral, the price of each stone of rice is 8 to 9 yuan, but when the fishing season is over in two months, it often costs 13 to 14 yuan, and the interest rate is incalculable. Since the establishment of the Chongming County Fifth District Credit Purchase and Sales Utilization Guarantee Cooperative, loans have been given at low interest rates, but the quantity is limited and limited to a corner of Shengshan, and its impact is not enough to change the high interest rates of the entire fishing village. There are currently 1,245 fishing households in the Shengsi Islands. Assuming that two-thirds of them lack capital, and each household borrows 50 yuan, then 41,500 yuan is enough. Furthermore, 8,500 yuan is used for shipbuilding loans. If there is a preparation of 50,000 yuan, it is enough to rescue the fishing villages in the Shengsi Islands of Jiangsu Province (each fishing season in the Shengsi District, there are often 7,000 yuan from outside, not included). Fishing is like agriculture, and the decline of fishing villages is even worse than that of rural areas. The government should not discriminate against the rescue of rural and fishing villages. The Fifth District Cooperative's loans for rice and loans have been recovered as scheduled, accounting for 95% of the total. The outer sea fishermen are stupid but trustworthy and are good targets for bank loans. It is requested that the authorities order Jiangsu to have agricultural banks, send personnel to conduct on-site investigations, and allocate 50,000 yuan specifically for fishing loans in the outer sea fishing villages, and order the Chongming County Government to instruct the cooperative instructors to go to the outer sea to guide cooperative matters. With the establishment of a sound cooperative organization, bank loans are easier to handle, and the revival of the outer sea fishing villages in Jiangsu is not difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>Promoting Education in Fishing Villages: In Chongming Fifth District, there are 11,506 males, 75% of whom are illiterate, totaling 8,619. There are 10,225 females, and only 42 are literate, accounting for slightly more than 4 per thousand. However, this number is still the statistics after Chongming established a district and established schools. In the outer sea fishing villages, there is no education to speak of. In the 23rd year, Yanghao and several colleagues founded a fishermen's elementary school in Shengshan with 70 to 80 students. In addition, there are only one or two private schools. This year, after the township chiefs of Shengsi received training in the town, they gradually realized the importance of education. Wu Xiaofa, the township chief of Sijiao Cai Guo, and Jin Yongyou, the township chief of Maguan, have successively established an elementary school in each township. The Chongming 25th year education budget plans to add two county-run elementary schools. The education of the outer sea fishing villages has a slight germination. However, fishing villages are not only different from cities, but also very different from rural areas. Education should adapt to the environment. To promote education in fishing villages, it is necessary to establish a plan suitable for fishing villages in advance. It is requested that the authorities order the Chongming County Education Bureau, Jiangsu Provincial Aquatic Products School, and Jiangsu Provincial Fishery Experiment Station to jointly study and formulate implementation guidelines as a standard for promotion.</p>
<p>Enforcing Effective Gambling Prohibition: The Shengsi Islands have a local population of only more than 21,000 people. However, during the fishing season, the number of temporary fishing boats and ice boats that moor in the port is about 7,000, and the number of temporary residents often reaches 20,000 to 30,000. At that time, a group of vagrant fishermen often mixed into the mountains to set up gambling dens and cheat people out of money. The fishermen who go out to sea to fish are extremely hardworking, and they do not know how to save their earnings and are addicted to alcohol and gambling as entertainment. After the establishment of the Fifth District Office of Chongming, in view of this, gambling was strictly prohibited during the fishing season. However, because most of the gamblers are vagrants and there are many people, the gambling wind has been slightly reduced in recent years, but it has not been completely eliminated. If gambling is not prohibited, the deception and corruption of fishermen will not stop. It is requested that the authorities order the Nantong District Commissioner's Office to appropriately dispatch a number of trained provincial security teams during the fishing season for short-term garrison to increase defense strength, which can suppress the establishment of gambling by foreign vagrants. After gambling is eliminated, the way to save fishermen's savings will be promoted, and the fishermen will be affluent, and the fishing villages will have the hope of self-revival.</p>
<p>Promoting the Shengshan Fishing Port: The Ministry of Industry announced in the Ten-Year Plan of the Industry in the 22nd year that the construction of the Shengshan Fishing Port was the first step in the fishery construction plan. According to the original plan, preparation and surveying would begin in the first six months of the first year, and the construction of breakwaters would begin in the latter six months. The main embankment would be completed in the first six months of the second year, and all accessories would be equipped in the latter six months. The entire budget was also planned, but unfortunately, it has not been implemented to this day. It is expected that from the 25th year, the Ministry of Industry will distribute all fishing protection industries to the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, which can save 250,000 yuan in fishing protection fees each year. It is requested that the authorities transfer 250,000 yuan of the remaining fishing protection fees from the 25th year to the initial construction cost of building breakwaters for the Shengshan Fishing Port, and complete the four-year plan as soon as possible. The fishing port is the mother of the fishing industry, which is also the way to develop the outer sea fishing industry in Jiangsu. In summary, the development of Shengsi is only a rough outline and is only for reference. The Shengsi Islands belong to Chongming County, but the strategic location and fishing industry are related to the entire province, and cannot be managed and developed by the power of one county. Moreover, Chongming has become a poor county after the division. All the major plans for the development of the outer sea fishing villages are requested to be carefully planned by the competent authorities and the aquatic science and health community, so that the implementation of the Shengsi development plan and the disputes over the borders of Jiangsu and Zhejiang will naturally cease. Today, the mountain people are pro-Soviet and unwilling to return to Zhejiang, which is also the result of the Soviet province's continuous rule after the establishment of the district. Sincerely presented, please review. Presented by Chen, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Lu Yanghao, citizen of Chongming County.</p>

<p>The Weather in Shanghai Returns to Hot</p>
<p>Scorching Sun Rampant and Extremely Hot</p>
<p>The Number of Patients in the Contagious Disease Hospital Increases Sharply</p>
<p>The weather in Shanghai has turned hot again after cooling down for a day. Yesterday, the temperature increased even more. Due to the impact of the sudden cooling and heating, more citizens are suffering from summer epidemics. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>The Weather Returns to Hot</p>
<p>The weather in Shanghai has turned from hot to cool, and at the same time, due to low pressure, the sky is cloudy and uncertain, and there are occasional showers. Until the day before yesterday, the air pressure began to rise, and the temperature also increased. Yesterday, the scorching sun was especially rampant, and it was extremely hot. Working in the heat was unbearable.</p>
<p>The Number of Patients Increases Sharply</p>
<p>Due to the impact of the recent sudden cold and heat, it is difficult for residents to adjust their daily lives. Summer epidemics have suddenly occurred. According to the Datong News Agency reporter's investigation at the Shanghai Contagious Disease Hospital yesterday morning, a total of 183 patients sought medical treatment at the hospital yesterday (July 7). The number of patients by disease is as follows: gastroenteritis 107, dysentery, malaria, heatstroke, relapsing fever, diarrhea, stomach cold, etc. 76.</p>
<p>Prisoners Demand Better Treatment, Massively Shout and Yell</p>
<p>After Suppression by French Police, the Situation Finally Calmed Down</p>
<p>Twelve Ring Leaders Brought to the Court for Interrogation</p>
<p>The detention center of the Second Special District Court on Xuehuali Road in the French Concession was ordered to be abolished by the Ministry of Justice and Administration on the first of this month. More than 300 detainees awaiting trial were transferred to the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Prison on Masnan Road. Recently, many detainees have expressed dissatisfaction, stating that after the transfer, the daily meals and dishes are worse than before, and family visits have been suspended. They are being treated the same as convicted prisoners. A few days ago, four representatives were selected from the prisoners to meet with Sun Xiong, the warden and head of the detention center, to request improvement. They were granted an audience, and a satisfactory reply was promised on the 7th. Unexpectedly, the prisoners, believing that the appointment date had passed and they had not received a satisfactory reply from the authorities, gathered at around 9:00 AM yesterday to shout and yell, and threw feces and urine at the guards. For a time, the noise was chaotic, and the guards were unable to stop them. They called the Lujiawan French Police Station, and the chief led a large number of Chinese and French detectives to suppress the riot. The commotion was quelled, and the twelve ring leaders who caused the incident were identified as: Li Shiying from Henan (25 years old, sentenced to death for the murder of Wang Bin, a detective of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, and Cao Qingcheng, an inspector of the Public Security Bureau); Du Xiaodi from Hunan (25 years old, sentenced to six days for intrusion); Li Jinsheng from Zhenjiang (30 years old, sentenced to five years for robbery); Tang Jinsheng from Suzhou (32 years old, sentenced to four years for robbery); Zhu Jinmei from Pinghu (27 years old, sentenced to six years for robbery); Wu Sannan from Changshu (28 years old, sentenced to nine years for robbery); Zhao Tao Tao from Zhenjiang (37 years old, sentenced to ten years for kidnapping); Fang Dalang from Chongming (47 years old, sentenced to eight years for kidnapping); Hu Senlong from Shanghai (29 years old, sentenced to seven years for robbery); Lin De from Shaoxing (30 years old, sentenced to life imprisonment for kidnapping); Yang Wenchang from Haimen (27 years old, sentenced to fifteen years for murder); and Gui Jinhu from Haimen (28 years old, sentenced to twelve years for the same murder case as Yang Wenchang). (These prisoners are currently appealing the second and third trials.) They were taken to the police station for interrogation and will be handed over to the court for investigation. It is reported that several prisoners were injured in the head and face and were bleeding. The police station ordered them to be sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Assassination of Sailor Incident, Ye Haisheng Performs for the Second Time Under the Starry Moonlight the Night Before Last</p>
<p>The First Special Court Held a Joint Trial Yesterday to Continue the Hearing</p>
<p>Korean Jack and Hirayama Motoichi Were Both Summoned</p>
<p>The Testimony of the Witnesses Was Clarified and the Trial Was Scheduled to Resume Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo was shot and killed. The Public Concession Police arrested the suspect Yang Wendao and two others, and charged them with murder in the First Special District Court. For the sake of prudence, the most important evidence in the case was: The hole-drilled book in which the pistol was found hidden in Yang Wendao's house; the bullet found at the scene of the incident; Yang Wendao's fingerprints; four photos of the deceased's injuries, and sent to the Zhenru Forensic Research Institute. The institute has identified each item and prepared a report to the court for reference.</p>
<p>Each Conclusion of the Identification</p>
<p>Has been summarized in yesterday's newspaper. However, Qian Hongye, the Chief Criminal Judge of the First Special Court handling the case, did not seek to be detailed. In addition to reviewing the identification report in detail with the two jurors Xiao Feng, he also learned that Nakayama Hideo was shot and killed on the night of November 9 last year. Last month, he sent juror Xiao to gather the police and the defendant's lawyer, ordering them to escort Ye Haisheng, who confessed to the murder, to Doulean Road to investigate, and asked Ye to perform the shooting scene at the time, but because it was daytime, the time</p>
<p>Was Very Different</p>
<p>I am afraid that all his actions are still difficult to resemble the day, so he was sent juror Xiao at 8:30 the night before last, and the clerk Ding was about to meet with the police lawyer, sent the police to escort Ye Haisheng to Doulean Road again, and performed the second performance under the star moon electric torch until 9:40. Afterwards, they left and returned. At 2 pm yesterday, Judge Qian continued to organize a collegiate panel with the two jurors Xiao Xie and Feng Shide, and ordered the three defendants Yang Wendao, Ye Haisheng, and Zhou Sherong</p>
<p>To The Case Research</p>
<p>Prosecutor Zhang was also present in court to perform his duties. There were still more than a dozen Japanese military officers and soldiers in the court to listen. The municipal government and the Municipal Public Security Bureau also sent personnel to the court to observe the trial. Korean Jack, who was detained by the Japanese Consulate, and Zheng Huimin, a Cantonese who had entered Japanese citizenship and changed his name to Hirayama Motoichi, had been repeatedly ordered by the court to summon them to testify, but they could not be summoned. Yesterday, they reported to the court as ordered, and Yang Wendao's concubine, who was also considered an important witness, could not be summoned. There are two other witnesses who have</p>
<p>Disappeared Without A Trace</p>
<p>After the court opened, Judge Qian first threw the book of applied physics with the hole for hiding the pistol to the defendant Yang Wendao for reading. Yang still claimed that the book was not his original book. The area size and book cover color of his original book were similar to this book, but there was no Chinese on the book cover. His book was always placed in the cabinet drawer, and Yang Jianzhong secretly brought this book to his house and secretly replaced the original book. The court then ordered the clerk Ding to select each item of the identification report of the Forensic Research Institute</p>
<p>Read It Out Loud Once</p>
<p>Then the record of the re-examination of the scene on the evening of the 7th was also read out. Judge Qian then instructed Zhou Sherong that he had investigated and clarified with the Public Security Bureau that your brother was arrested for a gambling case on November 5 last year and released on the 15th. You went to visit him twice on the 8th and 13th. Then the police lawyer Ru Bao Yi immediately stood up and stated that the police's investigation work on the case recently said that the court went to the scene to review the scene last night.</p>
<p>The Street Lights There</p>
<p>It has now been clarified that there are 100 light holders. In addition, there is Yang Wendao's concubine who was summoned as a witness, but it is a pity that she is not present today. Otherwise, she can also prove the situation of the book being found. Also, Yang Song and Liang Jie, who were summoned, were both serving in the New Taikoo Inn and were colleagues of Yang Wendao. They knew that Yang had several pistols hidden. When the police went to summon them, Liang Jie had abandoned his job two days earlier and did not know where he was. Later, I suddenly received a call from the defendant's defense lawyer Ge Zhaoji, saying that he knew the whereabouts of Liang Jie, and agreed to the police's request, and agreed to bring Liang Jie to the police station for questioning on June 22 on the same day. Unexpectedly, he did not break his promise on the expiry date. After investigation, it was learned that</p>
<p>Liang Has Gone To Hong Kong</p>
<p>According to the investigation, Yang Song went to Guangdong on June 23 and 24. On the day of the deceased's murder, the owners of a cigarette paper shop there, Chen Dasheng and Lu Hushi, both testified in person. After the event, the police asked them in detail about everything, and there were statements, which can also be used for verification. As for the Chen surname couple, it is not known where they have moved to. Ye Haisheng previously confessed that the Nanyang Dance Hall opened at midnight on January 9, and he was arrested at the dance hall, but it was found that the dance hall did open on November 8 and there was its</p>
<p>Hired Inspector</p>
<p>The letter is sufficient to prove it. As for the murder pistol, it was taken by the Military Police Department for inspection on November 10 after it was seized, and returned to the police station on the 19th and has been kept in the police station to this day, etc. Next, the Western Detective Chief of Disweilu Police Station reported the investigation process since the occurrence of the case and performed the situation of bringing the book found in Yang Wendao's home back to the police station in court, saying that when he arrived at the police station, he placed the book on the table and had not yet had time to ask Yang. Yang already</p>
<p>Caught A Glimpse Of The Book</p>
<p>He suddenly said "It's mine." Although he later said that it was his son A Xin's book, A Xin is only four years old now, so his son may not have been born when he put the book in place. The court questioned Yang Wendao and denied that the confession in the police station was his, saying that the Western Detective Chief did not put the book on the table at the time, but only held it in his hand and raised it. However, according to the Japanese witness, the police office clerk, he was also in the room at the time and witnessed Feng Yang Wendao admitting to seeing the book and that Yang had taken the book and watched it, etc. Judge</p>

<p>Sports News: Berlin World Games to Use New Timekeeping Equipment—Enabling Time and Photography to be Accurate to a Hair's Breadth— (National Haitong News Agency, Berlin, July 7th) The Berlin Olympic Games will have new timekeeping equipment. This equipment, in addition to a clock, also includes two cameras and a starting pistol together. Its greatest function is to ensure that the time is absolutely accurate. This new equipment was jointly invented by the German Physics Research Institute and a large film company. After repeated experiments by the authorities, the results were very satisfactory, so it has been adopted by the Olympic authorities. The situation at the finish line of each race is vividly captured by the camera, and it is possible to distinguish differences of even one-hundredth of a second. The electric meter connected to the camera can distinguish fractions of a second, so the winner's victory is accurate to a hair. This new equipment will be welcomed by all athletes and referees, because the photos taken at the last Olympic Games still had some discrepancies.</p>
<h3>Lawn Tennis: Kang Ti Defeats North Lawn by a Wide Margin</h3>
<p>The First Group's West Team Rescheduled for Supplementary Match on the 10th Due to Illness; League to Conclude, Kang Ti's Hopes High The Shanghai Lawn Tennis Doubles League, Kang Ti vs. North Lawn, was held yesterday at the Kang Ti court. With Kang Ti's strength, dealing with the mediocre North Lawn, victory was like taking something out of a pocket. In yesterday's match, the first group, He Jia and Chen Yi vs. Gao Qu and Ma Site, was postponed to this Friday (the 10th) due to Ma Site's illness, with the consent of the Kang Ti team. In the other four groups, Kang Ti won all three groups. Only the second group, Zhou Guanjun and Liu Jie vs. Fu Bo Si and Shi Tuo Ke Si, Zhou and Liu won the first set 6-3, but were too careless and were taken advantage of by Fu and Shi, losing 2-1. The overall result was 10-2, a big victory for Kang Ti. Yesterday, Kang Ti's instructor, Shen Meizhen, also personally took the field, partnering with Hu Xuguang, winning 6-4 in three sets against Pan La and Nuo Er Hao Si. Shen and Hu are veteran players, and their skills are naturally extraordinary. The league will end next week, and Kang Ti has the highest hopes for the championship. The results of each match are recorded below.</p>
<h3>International Swimming Competition to be Suspended This Year</h3>
<p>The annual International Swimming Championships, hosted by the local International Sports Association, held its fourth edition last year. Participants included units from China, Britain, the United States, Japan, and the Federation. Each session gathers the elite of Shanghai to compete, which was a grand occasion and the largest swimming competition in the city. This year, however, the news is silent. It is generally believed that the Western side may temporarily suspend the event this year due to various reasons. According to the swimming strength in this city, the British team is the strongest, led by Ha Meng. The United States is known for diving, with Heng Bai especially known as an eccentric, and Bu Liedeng, a short-distance swimmer, is also outstanding. The Chinese team has been considered lagging behind, but gradually showed activity last year. The strength is mainly based on the Zhong Qing team. However, there are also rumors that Zhong Qing's advanced class will be suspended this year. It is said that the captain, Jian Erming, will reorganize the team, but there is no concrete plan yet. Therefore, this grand international swimming competition will become a "Guangling San".</p>

<h3>Qinghua and Xiehe Universities Actively Implement Agricultural Education</h3>
<p>Qinghua University Opens Agricultural College in Xiang; Xiehe College Establishes Rural Construction College (Central News Agency, Changsha, 7th) Qinghua University is opening an agricultural college at Yuelin Lushan in Xiang. It has reached an agreement with the head of the provincial senior agricultural school on cooperation methods. The cooperation method was signed by Mei Yiqi, the president of Qinghua, Zhu Jingnong, the director of the Xiang Education Department, and Luo Dunhou, the head of the senior agricultural school. The main points are: 1. The senior agricultural school contributes the Zuochenglong campus as the basis for cooperation with Qinghua, so as to expand it, and Qinghua will be responsible for it. 2. Qinghua is responsible for research work, and the senior agricultural school is responsible for promotion work. 3. The senior agricultural school is still in charge of personnel and funds, and Qinghua is responsible for research and experiment funds and personnel. Fuzhou Private Fujian Xiehe College has been established for nearly 20 years, and recently implemented rural services and held rural area experiments. With the scientific research results, such as the selection of grain varieties, planting methods, pest control, and raising bees, silkworms, and livestock, practical experiments are conducted to inform the public, which has gained the trust of the general society. It is found that Fujian Province is located in the subtropics, with a mild climate, which is most suitable for agricultural development. However, in recent years, rural areas have been affected by various factors, and instead declined. It is sincerely appropriate to transform it with scientists as soon as possible, so that they can manage it according to law, and make the best use of the land. Then this natural agricultural production area has the hope of prosperity. The college is aware of this, so it intends to establish a third college in addition to the already established arts and sciences colleges, named the Rural Construction College. It is heard that the main purpose of running the new college is to cultivate specialists, prepare for agricultural improvement, expand equipment, and help promote agricultural affairs. The training subjects emphasize both agricultural technology and social methods, and both theory and practice are combined. Special attention is paid to the cultivation of sacrificial service personnel. The new college was established on July 1, and the Department of Agronomy and the Department of Agricultural Economics were first established. It is heard that Lin Liquan has been hired as the director, and preparations are actively underway for enrollment and registration, and teaching work is scheduled to begin in the autumn.</p>
<h3>China Health Education Society Annual Meeting to be Held in Zhen Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Shanghai to Help Two Midwifery Schools</h3>
<p>China-Germany Improves; Ci Hang Suspends Operations (Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th) The Ministry of Education issued an order to the Shanghai Education Bureau on the 8th, stating that the privately-run China-Germany Midwifery School is poorly managed, fails to properly guide and inspect personnel from the Ministry, and its attitude is frivolous, intending to refuse inspection. It should be given a serious warning. If it does not earnestly improve, the record should be revoked immediately. It also telegraphed the bureau, stating that the privately-run Ci Hang Advanced Midwifery Vocational School is poorly managed and has fabricated the record characters of the Ministry to hang on the school gate. The Ministry has ordered a thorough rectification and improvement last month and ordered the suspension of enrollment during the summer vacation this year for investigation. It is recently reported that the school's enrollment advertisement clearly violates the order, which is inappropriate. The bureau should be ordered to suspend the school to avoid misleading. All students at the school should be ordered to transfer to other schools separately, and a report should be submitted for compliance.</p>
<h3>Schools at All Levels Participate in Public Memorial Service for Fallen Soldiers</h3>
<p>To be Held at Miaohang at 10:00 AM This Morning; City Education Bureau Announces to All Schools The Shanghai Education Bureau announced to all schools in the city yesterday, stating that it received instructions from the Municipal Government, which included an instruction from President Jiang of the Executive Yuan, stating that special preferential treatment measures for revolutionary soldiers who were killed, disabled, or injured in previous battles have been followed and implemented, and it was decided to hold a public memorial service on July 9th, as well as a public banquet and condolences for those with special merits and the families of deceased officers and soldiers and disabled soldiers. There are also detailed regulations for two items. The annual public memorial service and public banquet period should be held as scheduled, and the method of comforting the families should also be carried out at the same time. It is important to handle it according to the schedule and report. Based on this, it was found that the case of special preferential treatment for revolutionary soldiers, regarding the original case of fallen officers and soldiers, stipulates that each place should build a public cemetery for fallen soldiers, and on July 9th of each year, convene local party, government, military, business, and academic circles to hold a public memorial service with extremely solemn ceremonies. There is an unnamed hero tomb built in Miaohang in this city, and it is now scheduled to convene all circles in the city to hold a public memorial service at 10:00 AM on the 9th of this month. It was also found that regarding the public banquet for injured and meritorious soldiers, the original case stipulates that a public banquet should be held once every year on July 9th, and the highest responsible officials of the local party, government, and military should entertain the public banquet. It is now scheduled to hold a public banquet for injured soldiers in the hall of this government at 12:30 PM on the 9th of this month, and please invite the highest party, government, and military leaders of this city to entertain the banquet together. Regarding condolences for the families of deceased and disabled officers and soldiers, this government has also purchased condolences items, and it is scheduled to send personnel to offer condolences and distribute them separately on this day. In addition to sending letters and notices separately, it is ordered that the bureau be instructed to participate in the public memorial service and instruct all schools in the city to participate in the public memorial service. This order, etc., should be complied with and implemented. All school principals in this city must participate in the public memorial service. This announcement is hereby issued.</p>
<h3>Elementary School Teachers No Examination or Assessment</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Department Schedules to Hold; The Jiangsu Education Department believes that the actual situation of elementary school teachers in the province's counties, based on the results of the investigation tables filled out by the counties this time, still shows that there are many unqualified teachers. At the time when compulsory education is being actively promoted, the need for teachers is even more urgent. The department has weighed the needs of the counties. In addition to holding the fifth elementary school teacher examination and assessment during the spring of this year, and issuing a general order to all graduates of provincial normal schools and rural normal schools in this session to return to their counties to serve, or those who deliberately violate the order will be severely pursued for tuition and food expenses and revocation of graduation certificates, it is still feared that the counties will not have enough teachers. In addition, among the unqualified teachers, there are those who have served for many years, have outstanding achievements, and have been approved for commendation by provincial and county supervisors, who must also be selected to avoid missing any talents. Those with poor teaching performance can also be eliminated through this. The department will hold another elementary school teacher no examination assessment in the 25th year of the Republic of China. All elementary school teachers who meet the requirements of Article 78 of the elementary school regulations should apply to the county education bureau or county government for review and submit a request for review. The validity period of the teachers who pass this no examination assessment is still four years, from August 1, 1936, to July 31, 1940. Yesterday, a special order was issued to the county heads and education bureau directors to report all personnel who should be subject to no examination assessment in accordance with the regulations, and not to delay.</p>

<h3>Hunan and Hubei Provinces Improve Obstetric Education Ministry of Education训会</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, according to the report of the staff, instructed the Education Departments of Henan, Hunan, and Hubei provinces to indicate the measures to improve obstetric education. The original order is as follows: Order to the Education Department of Henan Province: According to the report of Jiang Zhaoju, a member of the Obstetric Education Specialist Committee of the Ministry, who inspected the obstetric school of the Medical College of Henan University, "The school has been established for seven years. The president is concurrently the president of the university, and there is one director of teaching affairs and one director of obstetrics. Most of the teachers are full-time and there are no midwives. There are more than 60 beds. The light and architecture of the maternity hospital and outpatient department are good, but the student dormitory is too simple, humid, and has insufficient air and light. The curriculum and all equipment are relatively complete. Most of the deliveries are outside the hospital, because the local customs are not open, and the general public believes that they must wait until after the full moon before they can go home after giving birth outside. Moreover, staying in the hospital for a long time also causes economic problems. It seems that a maternity sanatorium should be set up, with female servants hired to take care of them. They can be moved to the sanatorium 10 days after delivery, and they can go home after the full moon, which can reduce the patient's expenses and avoid overcrowding in the maternity hospital. In addition, a rural maternity hospital should be set up nearby for students to practice." Please follow and forward the order. The order to the Education Department of Hunan Province briefly stated that, according to the inspection of the obstetric school in the province, "The provincial obstetric school is under preparation. The president is concurrently the director of the obstetrics and gynecology department of Xiangya Hospital, and the medical director is a full-time obstetrician, and there are 11 midwives. It is planned to add 30 beds, and it is expected to start school after the summer vacation. It is found that the work of maternal and child hygiene in Xiang Province has not been implemented for a long time. It is not easy to promote it because the local customs are not open. In the future, the school should accept more free patients for students to practice." Please follow and forward the order. The order to the Education Department of Hubei Province briefly stated that, according to the report of Jiang Zhaoju, a member of the Obstetric Education Specialist Committee of the Ministry, who inspected the obstetric school in the province, "1. The private Puren Obstetric School is jointly run by Tongpu and Xiehe hospitals. The faculty and staff are concurrently doctors and nurses from the hospital. The school building is suitable, the curriculum does not meet the requirements, and the equipment is complete, but there is no isolation room. Each student has about 40 deliveries by the time they graduate. The pre-delivery examination is mostly presided over by doctors, and students can also practice. The students are lively and tidy, but they all wear nurse uniforms, which should be corrected. In the future, more full-time teachers should be hired to increase teaching efficiency. 2. The president of the private Tongren Obstetric School is concurrently a doctor from the hospital. The director of medical affairs and training and other teachers are all concurrently doctors and nurses. The curriculum is suitable, and all equipment is mostly old-fashioned and too complicated. Each student has about 30 deliveries per year. The students all wear nurse uniforms. The pre-delivery examination is quite detailed, but the urine test is not done by the students, and methods should be found to improve it. 3. The private Hankou Red Cross Obstetric School is affiliated with the Red Cross Hospital. Most of the teachers are concurrently doctors from the hospital. There is no obstetric medical volume in the whole school, and all pregnant women are managed by one midwife. The qualifications of the teachers also do not meet the requirements. The curriculum can still meet the standard requirements, and the equipment is extremely simple. The whole school only has one broken sphygmomanometer, and the sterilizer is also very simple and not applicable. There are a total of 60 students, but they are not wearing uniforms. It is said that there are 30 beds, but only 16 are seen. There are currently eight patients, and it is said that there are four pregnant women, but all four are feverish. There are no babies in the hospital, and it is said that they have been sent home. All of the above points should be improved." Please follow and forward the order.</p>

<h3>Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Review Concludes for High School History Textbooks</h3>
<p>Only Four Kinds Are Relatively Realistic or Novel (Nanjing, 8th) The Central Boxer Indemnity Fund solicited high school history manuscripts, and the review team held the final review meeting on the 7th. Based on the standards and principles set by the first review meeting, the principle of awarding bonuses is to prefer quality over quantity. The distribution of bonuses: If the solicitation results in more than one excellent work, the bonuses may be divided equally by several people. If there are only mediocre works, or the excellent works do not fully meet the standards, a certain amount of bonuses may be given, but not the full amount. The review meeting decided on the following methods: In the first meeting, it was decided that there should be no abuse of power.

Xu Shikuan and Shen Hongmo each receive a remuneration of 500 yuan. 2. Zhang Huoran and Huang Zhong each receive a remuneration of 200 yuan.</p>

<p>Local News Supplement, Shanghai Daily News: Mishap Caused by Electric Perms</p>
<p>London, 6th - A report states: A female student, Ms. Xu, from the Mainland Barber Shop on Shandong Road, was getting an electric perm when, due to the barber's negligence, an electric shock occurred during the process. As a result, she fainted on the spot and was on the verge of death. She was sent to the hospital for treatment and gradually regained consciousness. It is said that the police will investigate the matter thoroughly.</p>
<p>Incidents of mishaps caused by electric perms have been reported in newspapers quite a few times before. Several local authorities, such as Suzhou and other places, even issued explicit orders prohibiting the practice of electric perms. However, despite the bans, people continue to get perms, and so-called modern women are still constantly innovating and changing their hairstyles. When we recall how women activists some time ago resolutely cut off their "three thousand strands of sorrow" [hair], it was merely to promote hygiene and avoid various troubles. Who would have thought that not long after, the situation would become the complete opposite?</p>
<p>It is said that electric perms, even without the risk of electric shock, are already harmful to one's health. Furthermore, from an economic standpoint, each perm is quite costly. What benefits are gained from such a high price, besides the so-called "beauty"? In fact, "beauty" achieved through artificial means is already a low-class pursuit. Moreover, it involves spending money and is detrimental to one's health.</p>
<p>Of course, in Shanghai, some women are forced by circumstances to adorn themselves in order to make a living, and their perms are somewhat understandable. However, this time the person injured by the perm is a female student in the midst of her studies. Those responsible for education should pay serious attention to this.</p>
<p>My opinion is that if this matter is "thoroughly investigated," whether it is due to faulty perm equipment or the barber's poor skills, the barber shop will undoubtedly be held accountable. However, we cannot say that the person injured by the perm is not responsible for their own actions!</p>
<p>I advise all women to refrain from emulating this "modern" trend!</p>
<p>In the Deep Night (Continued) by Luo Zhihua</p>
<p>I have never heard anyone loudly proclaim authority. Because, in this world, there are no days for authorities to live. Now, in this deep night, he loudly said it to me. Isn't this very special? Does he look down on me? Think I'm not worth a glance? Does he think saying he is an authority can scare me? I truly don't understand.</p>
<p>"Are you really an authority?"</p>
<p>I used to see many words in books at school. They said that living in this world ruled by authority, we must respect him. You cannot say the authority is a puppet, you cannot say he is lewd. You must obey him. If he tells you to die, you must not live. If he tells you to walk, you must not stand. Even if he tells you to jump into a fiery pit, you must not hesitate. We must obey authority with blind obedience. Only then will he nod, tell you to prostrate yourself, then sit on you and use a small knife to cut off pieces of your flesh to eat.</p>
<p>But, when we reach your generation, things have changed. I have never seen what an authority looks like. They are afraid of us recognizing him. He covers his face with cloth. So, I ask him this. He responds to me solemnly.</p>
<p>"Then, can you let me see your shadow!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense, your eyes are not worthy! I am the noblest and purest authority! You—"</p>
<p>"If you won't let me see, how can you prove your identity?"</p>
<p>"This… you listen…" The sound of a metal whip. "I have this. Everything belongs to me – you can't escape either... I am the authority!"</p>
<p>"But, do you know us—"</p>
<p>"You," he says with a disdainful snort, "You guys," as if contemplating something, then says, "You think I can't control you anymore. You want to break my whip, kill me, and seize everything I own – how arrogant you are, how dreamy you are, how naive you are! I tell you, my friends, you are still:"</p>
<p>"Shut up!" I sit up from the bed, put on my clothes like a warrior putting on armor, "Leave me quickly! I want to kill you! Quickly…"</p>
<p>He sneers, "Kill me? – Can you even touch the tip of my toe? You can't even get through the door…"</p>
<p>"But we can shake the foundation of your house and make you fall!"</p>
<p>"I will exhaust you and let you die!"</p>
<p>"We can still be born, still recover our spirits, because you can't leave us. You need us to supply you with the necessities of life!"</p>
<p>But your energy won't be enough to resist me – like you, you're already very tired. Do you still have the ability to fight me? – You can't, you…"</p>
<p>"I can," I stretch my arm, and inside it resounds the sound of life, "We are not afraid of getting tired!"</p>
<p>What are you doing all this for? Working so hard? But when you do things for me:"</p>
<p>"For freedom! For light! For…"</p>
<p>"Shut up," he says angrily, "Don't say those dusty words – under my whip, there are no such things. You have no right to speak. I am the authority!"</p>
<p>"But, we insist on saying them!"</p>
<p>"Don't speak! Don't move!"</p>
<p>He strikes the floor with the handle of his whip, and vanishes very vigilantly.</p>
<p>My body is even more tired. I am suppressed by a force and fall back on the bed.</p>
<p>The quiet night grows deeper. I listen carefully, as if there is a sound of the authority eating people. The air around me returns to how it was just now. Mosquitoes buzz.</p>
<p>I think, the night is deep, and dawn will break…</p>
<h3>Leaving Home</h3>
<p>By Ren Yong</p>
<p>My grandmother rushed in from the corridor, looking flustered. Like a gust of wind, she rushed to my mother's face, her wrinkled skin showing extreme panic. Her eyes were wide, her lips trembled. After she sat down on a straw mat, she gasped and said:</p>
<p>"I told you not to send Sanletou to school, but you insisted! You insisted!…"</p>
<p>My mother was stunned by this panicked look. She didn't know what had happened. For two or three months, rumors had been spreading that foreign soldiers had built barracks at the train station fifteen miles away. Some people said that these foreigners especially hated students with foreign learning, and in the future, the village chief would lead them to search house by house, imprisoning the men and taking the women to the barracks… Ma Lahei, who had fled back from beyond the border, said, "It's absolutely true! They were even buried alive back during the September 18th Incident!" My mother lamented her fate and was determined to have me come home. She wanted to cook especially good dishes for her son who had been wandering year-round. This time, she lost her leisurely state of mind. Whenever she heard villagers say that foreign devils had come to town again, she would worryingly look at my hair and say:</p>
<p>"Yong'er, you should shave your head. In case they come to inspect, you have hair like that…"</p>
<p>But day after day passed, and no one came to inspect. It was just that Korean people buying silver dollars and selling white powder (heroin) stayed in the inn on the north street of the town. Sometimes, three or five short people with high cheekbones and wearing foreign clothes would come, walk along the large iron bridge of the North River train station towards our village, take a few pictures, explore the depth of the river, chatter for a while, then ride away on bicycles.</p>
<p>At this time, the sunlight in the courtyard grew thinner and thinner, and the gray color like cooking smoke gradually spread across the land. Bats fluttered their wings from under the eaves, circled twice in the air, and then hid back in the shadows.</p>
<p>My mother looked at my grandmother with questioning eyes. She was pointing with her chicken-claw-like thin hands and saying:</p>
<p>"Two teachers from Sanletou's school were arrested by the county yamen. They said it was one man and one woman. On the road, they whipped them with leather whips. Sanletou came back and understood, she must never go to school again."</p>
<p>"Why were the teachers arrested?" My mother's voice trembled. Even such a short sentence seemed impossible to finish.</p>
<p>There was no answer. After a long silence, my grandmother could not explain what had happened, and muttered to herself, "Who knows?" Then, "Anyway, it's true that the two teachers were tied with ropes and went into the city with the yamen runners."</p>
<p>I pondered: My hometown is sinking into the fate of slavery day by day. If I leave home again, I will never have the fortune to return so calmly. I sadly felt that I could not offer even the smallest resistance to the evil demon pressing down on me, but instead planned to quietly slip out of this dismal area and hide in a quieter corner to eke out a living…</p>
<p>At night, my mother sat on the kang with a pale face and sighed. My thirteen-year-old sister, Lingzi, stood by the table, staring at me with a pair of</p>
<p>Page 22</p>
<p>confused eyes. After a moment of silence, I said,</p>
<p>"What's happening at the school now?"</p>
<p>"The principal said that they all resigned. In a day or two, the county will send people to take over. When the new principal comes, he will issue new textbooks. Teacher Ma and Teacher Zheng were unwilling to be slaves of a conquered nation and were arrested. What about you? We all said no!"</p>
<p>The next day, my sister did not go to school. On a misty, rainy morning at the end of April, I once again left my hometown.</p>
<p>The Old Taoist by Shen Jiaqian</p>
<p>Tales of the Jianghu</p>
<p>One summer, a small town in the north was abuzz with the strange tale of a diviner using the Lingguan method. The Lingguan's master was an old Taoist in his fifties. Like other benevolent old Taoists, he had a broad face, a long, greyish-white beard, and wore a blue summer cloth Taoist robe. When he appeared in that town, no one paid him any attention. He simply checked into a guest house and locked himself inside all day, as if he had come to this guest house to practice Taoism. This attracted the attention of the innkeepers, who secretly peered through the cracks in the window to see what exactly the old Taoist was doing in the room. Because of too many demonic legends about monks and Taoists, the innkeepers were wary of the old Taoist's strange behavior, fearing that some unfortunate event might occur.</p>
<p>In the old Taoist's room, incense and candles were burning. He put on his ritual robes and bowed deeply. He held a precious sword in his hand, as if he were performing a ritual there, drawing symbols and chanting spells. This unusual behavior immediately reminded the innkeepers, whose minds were dominated by biographical novels, of terrible deeds like the White Lotus Sect.</p>
<p>The innkeepers were so frightened that they wanted to report it to the police station, but they felt it was inappropriate. They worried that the old Taoist would use magic to harm their lives and families. When the innkeepers could not decide on their own, they secretly invited their neighbors to discuss the matter. The news naturally terrified every ignorant villager. They did not dare to suggest a way to deal with the old Taoist, as they were all afraid that an unfortunate event would befall them immediately. At that moment, the old Taoist barged into the room where they were discussing. He put his palms together and bowed to everyone. He kindly told them:</p>
<p>He was a poor Taoist who had fallen into the Jianghu and made a living by divining with the Lingguan method. As he spoke, he took out a small ebony figure from his sleeve, raised it high on his palm as if it were a priceless treasure, and then carefully hid it back in his sleeve. He said that the Lingguan was sacred and inviolable, and that he had to burn incense and offer sacrifices to it every day, so he immediately locked the door to his room to bow. In the light of the kerosene lamp, everyone seemed to see a strange light on the old Taoist's face, and they had already transformed from fear to respect. The old Taoist understood their meaning. He carefully observed the innkeeper's face and told him that he would have a son next year and that many guests would come to stay tomorrow. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>To the Editors: We have reviewed an article published in the "Local News Supplement" of your newspaper on the fourth of this month, titled "Even Boiled Water Must Increase in Price," and we are greatly surprised. The Shanghai Boiled Water Store Trade Association is currently reorganizing under the instructions of the Municipal Party Department, and there are no plans to increase the price of sales. The publication of this news item is clearly malicious. In addition to sending a letter to the reporter to negotiate, we hereby request your newspaper to make a correction.</p>

<p>Businesswoman……Xiao Yan</p>
<p>Mother……Ming Jin</p>
<p>Traveler……Pan An</p>
<p>Son……Chen Shouqiu</p>
<p>Luo Ping……Tan Guang</p>
<p>Blacksmith……Zhang Manfu</p>
<p>Mother</p>
<p>In the dark age of the old Tsarist Russia, politics and economy had reached their most corrupt state. Especially, the workers received cruel and inhuman treatment. Therefore, after a day of stuffy life, when the workers returned home, they had no choice but to seek some stimulation in alcohol; to vent their long-standing anger on their wives and sons.</p>
<p>However, they were all kind and hardworking workers. They eventually became disgusted with this miserable and suffocating life. As long as someone sincerely guided them, they would immediately awaken and embark on the great road to light. This is what the young people were especially longing for.</p>
<p>Here, as soon as the stage opens, the blacksmith is madly chasing his wife, the businesswoman, with a hammer to his father's house because she won't let him drink. The businesswoman begs her mother to hide her. The mother advises the blacksmith, "Isn't the proprietress good? She's so helpful in doing things for you, why do you want to hit her?"</p>
<p>However, when the blacksmith forcefully grabs the father's wine, she also trembles with fear of her father beating him!</p>
<p>After the blacksmith is tricked away by the mother, the mother and the businesswoman sigh together about their bad fate. They say:</p>
<p>--We spend our lives walking on our knees.</p>
<p>--We carefully serve our husbands, trying not to make them angry, hoping that they will have some pity on us and not hit us, but they often still hit us, as if they were hitting their enemies.</p>
<p>--In this day and age, it's already hard enough to live alone. Living together makes it even harder, even more terrifying!</p>
<p>From the above, we can see the abuse that women suffered indirectly from the social system of that era.</p>
<p>At this time, the son and the neighbor Luo Ping bring back a traveler. The traveler tells them some knowledge about life and news about other, brighter environments. But the elderly Luo Ping is skeptical of these words. He considers the failure of "struggle" to be the result of revolution, which suppresses his heart towards the light and reinforces his erroneous theory of fate. But the son is smarter and braver, and he accepts the traveler's words.</p>
<p>The traveler listens to the mothers' stories about husbands and wives and asks the son about the situation there. The son replies:</p>
<p>"If you want to understand our life, you should let me sing you a song." So the son pulls out the accordion and sings:</p>
<p>"Life flows like a muddy river:</p>
<p>Machines eat our flesh,</p>
<p>Coal smoke blackens our faces,</p>
<p>Alcohol burns our hearts</p>
<p>"After drinking, resentment arises in the heart,</p>
<p>Nowhere to vent, nothing can be done!</p>
<p>Often see fathers beating their sons;</p>
<p>Husbands knocking their wives!</p>
<p>"Otherwise, dance with a prostitute!</p>
<p>Play the accordion and sing a sweet song.</p>
<p>Life is the same for a hundred years,</p>
<p>My dear brother, don't be sad!"</p>
<p>After the son finishes singing, the traveler says the song is well written and asks who composed it. The son and the traveler go to visit the composer together.</p>
<p>At this time, the mother asks Luo Ping to accompany the businesswoman back and asks him to persuade the blacksmith. Just as Luo Ping is about to leave, he runs into the father returning home, who pulls Luo Ping in and asks him to drink with him.</p>
<p>But the father's wine is eaten by the blacksmith, and the father blames the mother. He beats her mercilessly. When the mother kneels in front of the Virgin Mary statue crying and praying, it arouses the father's anger even more and incites the father's kicking and beating.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the door opens and the son walks in. He cannot stand his father's unconscious behavior, so he resolutely grabs the iron hammer that the blacksmith left behind and is about to hit his father. But he is stopped by his mother.</p>
<p>The father then pushes the responsibility of supporting the mother onto the son.</p>
<p>After the father leaves, the son also begins to feel the panic of life and becomes depressed. He sits down like his father, rudely demands food from his mother, and unconsciously pushes his mother to the ground.</p>
<p>Finally, the son is moved by the sorrow of the mother and father and finally realizes the truth.</p>

<h3>Resumption of Commerce in Qiyang and Yongzhou, Southern Hunan: Commencing Electrical Orders to Shanghai for Goods</h3>
<p>First Batch of Goods to be Loaded Today</p>
<p>Transported by Sanbei Steamer</p>
<p>The Shanghai offices of various Hunanese customs brokers and Qiyang/Yongzhou merchants all received telegrams yesterday stating that the area is peaceful, and that all conditions have returned to their state within May. The two locations now require a large batch of goods to supply the people's purchases, and foreign fabrics and piece goods are in particularly urgent need.</p>
<p>Large-scale Procurement Immediately: General merchandise and daily necessities must also be urgently arranged for shipment. Speed and quantity are of utmost importance. Upon receiving the telegrams, Shanghai customs brokers and Hunanese merchants have contacted shipping companies regarding their purchased and stored goods, requesting transport on the Changsha route. It is reported that three local customs brokerage firms are handling the shipping procedures for the goods going to Qiyang and Yongzhou. In order to catch the earliest possible shipment, the first batch of goods has been approved by the Sanbei Company, which will dispatch the</p>
<p>Sanbei Steamer Today: As of yesterday, the Sanbei Steamer was fully loaded with goods destined for Qiyang and Yongzhou, still to be transported to Changsha before being transferred to the two locations. After this batch is shipped, a second batch will be transported, but this must await a direct Shanghai-Changsha steamer before loading can commence. According to the Changsha branch manager of the Sanbei Company, everything in central Hunan has recently returned to normal, and financial and commercial affairs have also temporarily stabilized. The tension of last month has eased, and the transport of goods is proceeding as usual.</p>
<h3>Before the Implementation of Income Tax:</h3>
<p>Economic Surveys of Industry and Commerce Are First Necessary</p>
<p>Advocacy from the Shanghai Financial Community</p>
<p>The Da Gong She reports that the Ministry of Finance has decided to implement income tax this year, divided into three categories: profit, salary, and interest. This will be enacted upon passage by the Legislative Yuan. According to sources in the Shanghai financial community, investigative work must be done before the implementation of income tax. For example, with regards to interest, ordinary, law-abiding citizens will naturally pay according to regulations. However, there is no shortage of selfish individuals who will deposit cash into foreign banks that are not subject to income tax. When the time comes, not only will tax revenue be reduced, but there is also a risk of capital flight. Furthermore, with regards to profit, various industries have been sluggish in recent years. At the end of each year, their business reports naturally claim profits, but in reality, there are often bad debts and write-offs. However, the account books still look very good on paper. It will naturally be difficult to tax them according to regulations. Therefore, it is hoped that when the Ministry of Finance levies taxes, it will first undertake economic surveys of industry and commerce.</p>
<h3>Scope of Industrial Syndicate Loans:</h3>
<p>Assisting Emerging Industries and Improving Existing Industries</p>
<p>Date of Establishment to be Submitted to the Ministries of Finance and Industry for Examination</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Bank of Communications and the Four Banks Savings Association are jointly forming an industrial syndicate to assist the development of national industry and expand the scope of bank investment. Three months ago, relevant personnel from the two banks had already made private contact and begun investigations. Concrete plans are now being properly discussed so that they may be submitted to the various banks for research. According to those in charge of the two banks, reports that the syndicate will be established within the month are premature. The organizational outline is still being drafted and has not yet been formally discussed with the various banks. The total amount of capital will also depend on the scale of the organization and cannot be determined at this time. The date of establishment is also difficult to predict. When the time comes, a request will be submitted to the Ministries of Finance and Industry for approval. Furthermore, the nature of the syndicate's loans will focus on assisting emerging industries and improving existing industries.</p>
<h3>Party and National Flag Promotion Committee: Inspecting Flag Displays throughout the City Today</h3>
<p>The Party and National Flag Uniform Promotion Committee, in order to examine achievements, has scheduled an inspection for 9:00 AM today. The inspection personnel will be drawn from various agencies and organizations, including the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the China Aviation Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Bureau of Education, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Settlement, the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession, the Citizens' Federation of the Second Special District, the Party and National Flag Manufacturing Bureau, the Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, the Municipal Bureau of Health, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Education Association, and the Municipal Agricultural Association. At that time, they will depart by car and conduct inspections in different areas. The inspection routes are divided into four areas: Zhabei and the city center line; North Station, Yongxing Road, Jiangwan, city center, Wenzaobin, Wusong, Yinxiang Port, Linping Road, North Sichuan Road; Xinzha and Caojiadu line; Hengfeng Road, Menggu Road, Zhenru, Caojiadu, Pusong, Xujiahui, Caojing; West Gate and the 16th Pier line; Old North Gate, Yimiao, West Gate, Wenmiao, 16th Pier, Dongjiadu, Xundao Street, Gaochang Temple; Pudong line.

<h3>Li Xiaosheng Returned South Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chu Fucheng and Others Traveled Together</p>
<p>Li Xiaosheng, a member of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, flew from Guangzhou to Shanghai on the 5th to discuss the arrangements for Chairman Hu's state funeral. He went to Nanjing that evening, calling on the Presidents of the Executive and Legislative Yuan, and communicated on all matters. After staying in Nanjing for only one day, he returned to Shanghai the previous morning. After meeting with Central Committee member Cheng Tiangu and others, he boarded the President Jackson of the Dollar Steamship Lines that evening, setting sail at 2:30 AM yesterday morning, departing Shanghai to return south, going to Hong Kong and then Guangzhou. Liu Guanxun and Wu Shangying, representatives dispatched by the Legislative Yuan to Guangzhou to attend Chairman Hu's encoffining ceremony, as well as Shanghai silk merchant Chu Fucheng, also traveled on the ship. Chu has had a considerable position in the past. In recent years, he has withdrawn from public life in Shanghai to engage in commerce, enjoying a prominent reputation. Chu was also an old acquaintance of the late Chairman Hu. At this time of serious national crisis, Chu is quite concerned in his private capacity. Therefore, he braved the summer heat to travel south, appealing to the authorities in Guangdong and Guangxi, hoping to turn conflict into peace, and to participate in the encoffining ceremony of the late Chairman Hu.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe Returned to Shanghai Last Night</h3>
<p>Japanese Ambassador to China, Shigeru Kawagoe, along with Counselor Wakasugi of the Embassy, entered Beijing by Japanese warship on the first to present his credentials to Chairman Lin, and met with President Chiang. Having completed his official business, he left Beijing by express train with his entourage at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, arriving at the North Station at approximately 11:50 PM due to the slow train journey. The Japanese Consul-General Ishii and others were at the station to welcome him. After disembarking, he went directly to his private residence on Bishun Road to rest. As for the date of his visit to inspect the embassy in Peiping, it will probably be after the weather cools down in the autumn.</p>
<h3>National Economic Construction Commission Headquarters: Issuing Letters of Appointment to Various Sectors</h3>
<p>The headquarters of the National Economic Construction Movement Commission was formally established in Nanjing on the 4th. Letters of appointment for the appointed committee members have also been issued separately. Chen Guangfu, Qian Xinzhi, Qin Runqing, Xu Xinliu, and Yu Zuoting from the financial community of this city; Rong Zongjing, Liu Hongsheng, Wu Yunzu, Guo Shun, Hu Xiyuan, and Wang Yunwu from the industrial community; and Yu Qiaqing, Wang Wanlai, and Du Yuesheng, among others, have all received letters of appointment from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek.

<h3>The Guangdong Banking Guild Telegrams the Guangdong Provincial Government: Protesting the Japanese Consul's Protection of Smuggling</h3>
<p>The Shen Shi News Agency reports that the Guangdong Banking Guild of this city telegraphed the Guangdong Provincial Government yesterday, stating: "Your Excellency, the Guangdong Provincial Government, an investigation has revealed that the situation regarding smuggling in North China is becoming increasingly serious. Our country's national finances and social economy are undoubtedly being destroyed, and losses are enormous. Recently, it has spread throughout the country, becoming increasingly rampant, which is a major crisis for the future of our nation. Guangdong is a coastal area, where merchants gather and Chinese and foreigners congregate. In the past, it was already a breeding ground for smuggling. Now, it is further affected by North China, and the situation will naturally become even more prosperous. It has now been learned that on the 25th, the Shantou Chao-Hai Customs went to the Japanese-owned Lianfa Commercial Firm on Chao'an Street to inspect smuggled goods. However, the Japanese Consul Harada in that area actually sided with the smugglers, who were making a great commotion, and sent personnel to stop the inspection. The next day, he submitted a protest to the Customs, demanding that if the Customs wished to inspect smuggled goods from Japanese merchants, the consular office should be notified three days in advance and a date should be set, after which Japanese police should be sent to assist in the inspection; otherwise, resolute measures would be taken, etc. After learning of this, our guild is overcome with indignation. The inspection of smuggled goods and the punishment of those who evade taxes involve probing into secret schemes, exposing hidden betrayals, and uncovering wickedness. How can there be prior notification, allowing them to hide the smuggled goods in advance? Moreover, this action is an independent administrative right of our Customs. How can the Consul dare to interfere so brazenly? The Consul not only fails to restrain his expatriates to promote good relations, but also obstructs anti-smuggling efforts, hoping to achieve his goal of protecting smuggling. Such abuse of power and contempt for our national sovereignty is extremely illegal. If we continue to tolerate and indulge this behavior, we fear that the incidents of destroying the Customs in Tianjin and Qingdao, and the armed smuggling by the Darong Maru at Qikou, will inevitably reappear in Guangdong. We beseech Your Excellency's government to lodge a serious protest against the Japanese Consul's unreasonable demands immediately, to protect the integrity of our Customs' anti-smuggling prerogatives, and to strengthen our armed anti-smuggling forces for precautionary measures. This is what we hope for. This telegram is sent specifically to inform you. We pray for your attention. Sincerely, the Guangdong Banking Guild, stamped."</p>
