<h3>太平洋的危機與我們的責任</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>太平洋學會英美俄三國代表曾經在圓桌會議以及會外談話的時候。竭力要使日本代表就日本在亞洲發展的企圖。說出一些輪廓來。這在出席學術性質的會議的日本名人。要作一個明白的表示。的確有些不好意思。列强代表始終得不到滿意的答覆。是當然的。其實大家對於這個問題。在肚裏也早有幾分明白了。因為近年來日本所表演的大陸政策的種種節目都是十分驚人。而且意味深長的。</p>
<p>日本在亞洲大陸演出的武劇。顯然已經引起了太平洋的非常緊張的局勢。這局勢甚至使日本自身也不能不感覺到相當的憂慮。因此日代表前外相芳澤在末决會議說道。「太平洋問題實在得不到大家滿意的解决辦法。現在各國的關係。一天天緊張起來。如果再不及時防止。就要發生嚴重的後果了。」這的確是關心太平洋和平的人們大家都有的感想。但是事實旣然證明着。各國關係的緊張。是日本在大陸的軍事發展所造成的。那麽。「解鈴還是繫鈴人。」要防止嚴重的後果。自然也有賴於日本自身的覺悟了。</p>
<p>然而就今日的情勢看來。軍國主義日本向大陸的進取精神是一發難收的。而日本軍人所標榜的東亞安定勢力。又是有着充分的戰爭性質的。我們怎能僅僅從日本自身的覺悟上。來指望避免芳澤所謂「嚴重的後果」呢。我們中國久已成了太平洋危機的中心。我們從全民族的切身利害着想。人人有着挽救這種危機的莫大的責任。這是我們深切地認識到的。我們要使中國得了救。要使太平洋回復到「太平。」當然非自身來盡最大的努力不可。努力的目標只有一個。那就是趕緊拋除了各種較不重要的成見。把全國的力量團結起來。然後聯合了太平洋有關各國維持和平的一切力量。造成一種和平性質的眞正的安定勢力。</p>

<h3>如何保護農作物的益蟲（上）</h3>
<p>— 浙江大學農學院院長吳福楨</p>
<p>（一）什麼呌益蟲</p>
<p>益蟲與害蟲，為兩個相對的名詞，實際上蟲的本身無所謂益興害。現在我們口頭所講的益蟲與害蟲，乃指昆蟲對於人類關係而言，就是對於人類有益的，謂之益蟲，有害的，謂之害蟲。例如蠶吃桑葉，蠶對於桑樹為有害，但是蠶能結繭，可以供給我們做衣服的原料，對於人類有益，所以我們稱蠶是益蟲。野蠶亦吃桑葉，亦能結繭，但是野蠶的繭很小，絲質亦不好，不能供給我們做衣服的原料，對於人類沒有益處，反而要消費我們栽培的桑葉，所以我們稱野蠶為害蟲。將來野蠶所結的繭，如果能與現在的家蠶一樣，可供我們利用，那來現在稱牠為害蟲，將來就要稱牠為益蟲了。又如芫靑，牠的成蟲是食害豆類及番茄等作物的，當然是害蟲，但是牠的幼蟲，生長在土裏，却能尋食蝗蟲的卵子，給我們除害，又是益蟲了。再如倉庫裏的大教盜，牠的幼蟲和成蟲，有時吃其他的倉庫資蟲，有時吃米毅，當牠吃害蟲是益蟲，吃米穀時却又是害蟲了。所以益蟲與害蟲是相對的名詞，並且完全要看牠對於人類利害的大小哩。</p>
<p>對於人類有益的昆蟲很多，如蠶，蜜蜂等直接可供給人類衣食的原料，我們大家都能明白牠們是益蟲。遼有許多昆蟲，直接對於人類不見有益，就是不能供給人類做衣食的原料，但是牠們間接却能保護我們衣食的原料，所以這許多昆蟲，我們亦稱牠為益蟲。現在所要講的農作物益蟲，就是指這許多對於人類間接有益的昆蟲而說的。</p>
<p>（二）農作物益蟲的類別</p>
<p>農作物益蟲的種類很多，像各種蜂類，蛾類的傳佈花粉，對於許多農作物的生殖，有密切之關係；許多在地下生活之昆蟲，因為牠們在土裏活動的結果，而改良土壤的組織，因為牠們的排洩物和屍體等的腐敗，而增加土壤的生產力，都直接與農作物的生產有關係。但現在所講的，並不是屬於這幾種，而是講各種能帮助人類淸滅為害農作物的害蟲的昆蟲。譬如螟蟲和蚜蟲，是農作物的害蟲，但是有許多昆蟲能殺死牠們，使各種農作物少受牠們的為害。這許多帮助人類殺死農作物害蟲的益蟲，牠們是有益於人類，所以我們應常盡力保護，使牠們得以盡量繁殖，帮助我們殲除害蟲。</p>
<p>要講這許多農作物益蟲的保護方法，我們應該先明白這許多益蟲怎樣殺死害蟲。益蟲殺死害蟲的方法，概括的講來，可分兩類；一類是寄生的，就是益蟲寄生於害蟲的體內，把害蟲當作食料，而使害蟲死亡；屬於這一類的益蟲，像各種寄生蜂，寄生蠅等都是。還有一種是捕食的，就是益蟲直接搜取害蟲，把害蟲當作食料；屬於這一類的益蟲，像瓢蟲，步行蟲等都是。寄生的方法，有的寄生於害蟲的卵內，有的寄生於害蟲的幼蟲體內，有的寄生於害蟲的蛹內，有的寄生於害蟲的成蟲　內。捕食的方法亦不一，有的吃害蟲的卵的，有的吃害蟲的幼蟲的，有的吃害蟲的成蟲的，不過吃害蟲的　的比較少些。我們在田間所看到的許多重要害蟲，所以不能照我們理想的那樣猖獗為害，就是靠這許多益蟲去襲擊牠們，使牠們不能盡量繁殖的緣故。</p>
<p>（三）農作物益蟲的保護法</p>
<p>農作物益蟲攻擊害蟲的方法，旣有不同，保護的方法，亦因益蟲的種類而變化。不過目前除掉寄生蜂有特殊的保護方法外，其餘還只有任其自然生殖。反正我們只要知道牠們是益蟲，不去摧殘牠們，也就是保護牠們了。現在卽就寄生性的和捕食性的兩種分述於下：</p>
<p>（一）寄生性的益蟲</p>
<p>（甲）卵寄生性的益蟲卵寄生性的益蟲很多，不過大都是寄生蜂，所以現在就把螟卵寄生蜂來作代表講述一下：螟卵寄生蜂的身體很小，體長不過二厘內外，所以一般農人都沒用心過，其實牠的數量亦多得不了。身體是黑色，好像夏天吸吮人畜血液的　蟲（蚋）差不多大小。當螟蛾產卵在稻葉上後，牠就導覓卵塊，產卵其中孵化以後，就以螟卵為食，因此被寄生的螟卯，就不能孵化為蟲。寄生蜂的幼蟲在螟卵內成長以後，就化為蛹，再由蛹化為成蟲，飛出螟卵，到其他未會寄生的螟卵內產卵，牠這樣循環生長，每年的有七八代。各地螟卯被這蜂寄生的，據調查結果，的有百分之四十以上；換一句話說，就是一百個螟卵富中至少有四十個是被道寄生蜂寄生而死亡的；也就是說，我們稻的損失，因為有這寄生蜂，可至少减少百分之四十。所以保護寄生蜂，確是一件急不容緩的事情</p>
<p>這種寄生蜂，究應如何保護，最簡便的方法，可用一大一小兩隻缸，大的直徑的二尺，高一尺半，小的直徑和高都的一尺。大缸中放水半滿，水面滴火油少許，然後將小缸放入大缸內，缸底並用石塊鎮壓，以防小釭在大缸內浮動；大缸的上面應用笠帽懸空覆蓋，以免雨水等落人。這種裝置，我們就呌牠寄生蜂保獲缸。這保護缸裝設好了，我們就把採得的螟卵塊，放入小缸中。我們知道，我們採得的螟卵，其中有的是被寄生蜂產卵過的，有的是沒有被寄生蜂產卵邋的憑我們肉眼是不易分辨的；反正我們也不要去分辨，只要是卵塊，都採了放進缸去，沒有被寄生蜂產卵過的，螟卵孵化以後，因小缸四週有油水，不能外逸而餓死，就是有逃逸的，也都沾油而死亡；而已被寄生蜂產卵過的螟卵，當然不能再孵化，但寄生蜂產在螟卵裏的卵，却很安　地化為幼蟲，目把螟卵當作食料生長着，而腎而成蟲。當牠羽化為成蟲後，就不願再居在舊螟卵裏，而飛出缸外另找沒有寄生過的螟卵，再行產卵而繁殖牠的子孫。所以這寄生蜂保護缸，除能殺死　蟲外，實在是寄生蜂的安樂窩。但是裝設這種保護缸，管理上還要注意幾點：</p>
<p>一，寄生蜂保護缸上的笠帽，應比大缸大一些，並且不能用破的，以免雨水等落入。</p>
<p>二，保護缸應置於稻田附近，以使羽化的寄生蜂飛入田間尋覓卵塊。</p>
<p>三，放置卵塊時，連秧葉直列小紅中，卵塊四週，不可有雜草或樹枝等物與大缸通口接近，否則恐有孵化的幼蟲逃出缸外的弊病。</p>
<p>四，螟卵放入保護缸後，應該時時去檢查，看看有沒有孵化的幼蟲落水不死的情形，如果有的話，就再加滴幾點火油而殺死牠。</p>
<p>五，螟卵放入保護缸後，要經過兩星期方能取出。</p>
<p>六，寄生蜂保護缸的設置，愈多愈好，其設置地點，並且要平均分配，至少二十畝田須設一缸。</p>

<p>（一）精神部門　養成舉國一致的團結心、排斥外來之惡思想、以期確立日本精神、</p>
<p>（二）人員部門　第一須確立徵募統制機關、如國民登錄法之制定、熟練按術職員之召集、猶豫藉工業動員法强制徵集制度之確立等、皆不可一日緩也、歐洲大戰時、德國制定祖國補助勤務法、卽滿十七歲至六十歲之男子、其使用權屬於政府、他如法國之國民動員法、英國之國民勞役法、美國之登錄法等、皆可為參考之實例也、</p>
<p>（三）產業部門平時之國內產業、係以國民生活為主體之一部統制、戰時則以軍需充足為第一戰、故應順應國際情勢、於平時確立戰時產業動員之根基、因此如不足資源之補充、資源之保存、代用品之研究、確立戰時軍需優先制度管理貿易等、皆為必要、且須設立由平時產業轉換戰時產業之執行機關、</p>
<p>（四）工廠都門謀工廠之擴充統制、以增進生產能率、並於平時設適當之準備機關、準備平時工廠可一變而為軍需工廠、又設備機器之統一、敎育制度之實施、亦為必要、避免戰時生產之漫無節制、又須管理收用工廠也、</p>
<p>（五）金融部門　世界大戰德國戰費平均每年為三百四十億馬克、英國十七億五千萬磅、美國百三十一億美元、據日本經濟專門家之推算、將來戰費每年的需二百億元、故為籌措此鉅大戰費起見、須於平時設特殊金融機關、豫先研究對策、</p>

<p>（二）調查南洋諸地方之移民事業·振興貿易·農確林各業投資情形、</p>

<p>（一）南洋諸國誤認日本南進政策為武力的侵略、而對於日本正當之輕濟發表政策、抱懷疑心、尤其暹羅、因英法勢力介在其間、處境頗為困難、日本應為努力使暹羅理解日本正當行為、</p>

<h3>巴勒斯坦變亂的解剖（上）</h3>
<p>— 不忍</p>
<p>巴勒期坦的變亂，雖然悲慘得很，並不是一件新奇的事情。過去若干年中，有好幾回，在巴勒期坦發生過由慢性的不安而爆發的暴動與殺戮。歷决變亂雖經英軍壓平，但不安的根苗却永遠留在着，而且隨時會引起新的變亂來。這些根苗由來已久，性質也很複雜。巴勒斯坦這地方，雖然面積狹小，並不　腴，却是暴風雨的中心，那里有互相敵對的種種信仰，民族思想與帝國主義在複雜的鬥爭中銜突着，使全世界都起風浪。</p>
<p>這問題的宗敎的局面是頗顯著，又頗久遠的。對於基督教，猶太敎，與回敎，巴勒斯坦可以說是共同的聖地。不幸得很，這三大宗敎因爭奪土地管轄權而起的歷史的鬥爭，在世人心中，至今尙未遺忘。古遠的悲劇，如十字軍，如羅馬人燬聖堂，甚至如的書亞出征，依舊打動着人們的心靈，煽動着人們的慾望。可是，光是從宗敎方面解釋巴勒斯坦的現狀，却是一個錯誤。那些傳統的因素已被更繁多的晚近勢力—如國家主義思想和經濟發展—壓浚而且更改了。在正確評估巴勒斯坦變亂的現狀之前，我們務須了解這新舊因素的交互作用。</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦目前危機的顥著的情勢，當然是猶太人與阿拉伯人之間的惡鬥。但這惡鬥却是新起的事。大戰以前，實在沒有這一回事。直到一九一四年為止，巴勒斯坦是奧托曼帝國的領土之一，與其他許多民族同受土耳其蘇丹的統治。這是不容諱首的：土耳其人與阿拉伯人，雖同屬回敎，却並不和睦。這也是不容諱言的：巴勒斯坦與其地土耳其領土的阿拉伯人在某一時期開始吸收西方的民族思想，而且夢想脫離土耳其的統治。但在那時期，阿拉伯人的民族思想還很幼穉，而且地們所注意敵人只是土耳其人。在那時期，猶太人不是重要的角色，因為居留在巴勒斯坦的猶太人要比阿拉伯人少得多。被稱為「猶太民挨主義」（Zionirm）的思想的灌輸尙未開始。而且，道是更重要的：猶太民族主養在那時期不過是一種虔誠的靈感，為實現理想起見的實際動作是沒有的。</p>
<p>現代猶太民挨主義的興起，距今不過五十多年。牠的發源地不是在巴勒斯坦，却是在歐洲，提倡者為西方猶太人，以黑士爾博士（Dr．Theodor　Herzl）為領袖。現代猶太主義是以前的純粹宗敎思想的政治變態。至於純粹宗敎意味的猶太民族主義，則是從羅馬人燒燬聖堂屠殺巴勒斯坦的猶太居民那時候起就存在的。當然，離散的猶太人依然懷戀着失去的故土；在以後數百年中，各地的猶太人隨時趕往故鄕，參詣聖地，憑弔遺蹟。更有由少數虔誠的猶太人集成的小團體，常住在巴勒斯坦。這些小團體的分子，多數係上了年紀的人，他們接受了外方的捐助，以長期禱吿輿默頌消度他們的餘年。他們期待着「以色列復興」（Resloration　of　Zion）的實現，因為這是潛伏在任何猶太人心中的一個希望。</p>
<p>可是，這些回到故土的猶太人，沒有一個是現代意味的猶太民挨主義者，因為他們所期待的「以色列復興」是要出於耶和華的意志而奇妙突元地出現的。這神聖事體究竟在什麽時候發生，只有上帝自己知道。實在，那些長住在巴勒斯坦的極端正統派分子是看不起現代意味的猶太民族運動的。在那些典式熱在者的心目中，用人力實現以色列復興的任何企圖，尤其是出於不完全遵守傳統敎律的猶太人的企圖，不但不能感動耶和華，且更觸怒於他，因此會使期待着的奇蹟延期實現的。</p>
<p>那麽，所謂『現代的猶太民族主義』究竟是怎樣的呢？它的基本目的是在巴勒斯坦建設一個「民族營」，那里至少有廣大的猶太人居住地域，那里猶太民族得自由發展特異的個性，其結果會使散居各地的猶太人享受更大的尊榮和價値，雖然他們不住在巴勒斯坦，或甚至不曾到過祖先的故鄕。</p>
<p>這樣的計畫是從大戰前就開始的。在大戰前三十年中，以巴勒斯坦為目的地的猶太民族主義殖民團逐漸發達起來，其經費由全部猶太人捐助。那些早期的猶太民族主義運動不曾引起土耳其官塲與住在巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯人的懸慮。那時期的猶太民族主義沒有外交的後助，同時從事農業的移民大抵未經挑選，所以他們不慣工作而仍須雇用阿拉伯工人。簡言之，在一九一四年以前猶太民族主義是一個被忽視的因素。</p>
<p>但這情形却因世界大戰而驟然改變了。當戰爭初起土耳其與中歐列强聯絡的時候，恊約國就决定奧托曼帝國的末日。這當然引起各種希望與夢想來。在猶太民挨主義方面，這情形允為顯著；結巢是這樣：到了戰爭高潮，英國政府因著名的一貝爾福宜言—（Balfour　Declaralion）而贏得猶太民族主義的擁護。這宣言的條文說：『英政府贊成猶太人在巴勒斯坦設置民族營，願竭力助其成功……』</p>

<h3>胡西園播音演講　提倡國貨的淺說</h3>
<p>我向來不會演講、偏偏今天輪到我來演講、這不是很為難的事情嗎、而且「提倡國貨」這名詞、大家都聽得熟透了、但是徧徧今天我演講的題目、又是這四個字、諸位、試想想、這是多麽廣泛而且熟套啊、上回蔡聲白先生潘仰堯先生、還有許多熱心國貨的諸位、都已講得很透澈的了、呌我再講些什麽呢、不是一個難題嗎？</p>
<p>說誌提倡國貨、那是國民應盡的義務、也就是每個國民的天職、這句話、並不是要抄襲別人的老調、我想提倡國貨是民眾普遍應該知道的、不必引着高深的理論、我便講一些淺近的譬喻、可以明白了、</p>
<p>譬如有一個李家村、住戶數十家、種田几百畝、很能自食其力、不用仰仗他村的帮助、可是李家村裏、雖然每年的收穫很好、却沒有一种舂米的機器、所以每年所出的稻子、不是化了舂費、請鄰近的張家村代舂、便是先把穀子以很低的代價售賣給張家村、再用高貴的米價、向張家村然米來度日、這樣李家村雖買年年收穫不錯、可是他的利益、都給張家村剝削去了、諸位、試想一想、這樣地過下去、李家村不要天天鬧窮了嗎、</p>
<p>後來李家村裏有一個某甲、想法買到了幾部舂米的機器、也便以狠低的代價、替本村的代舂穀子免得把花花綠綠的法幣、都給張家村拿了去、誰知李家村裏、沒有見識的人、却占居着大多數、雖然某甲買來了幾部機器、而他們却並不信任他、仍舊把穀子低賤地賣去、又出高貴的米價、買米回來、這不是使某甲要感到大大地失望和灰心了嗎、</p>
<p>我這個譬喻、李家村便是我們的中華民國、張家村便是外國、也便是列强、某甲呢當然是國貨工厰了、</p>
<p>還有一個譬喻、是關於人類的天性的、國貨好像我們自己的子弟、外國貨就是人家的子弟、對於自己的子弟、應該愛護他、指導他、希望他事業前途的發展、這是一定的難道願意去愛護與自己毫不相干的人家子弟、而反眼看着自己可愛的子弟流連失所嗎、我想、凡有人心的决不至此罷、</p>
<p>國貨工厰的設立、其目的不在乎完全為營利而是為要挽回往外流出之金錢、保存本國的財力、這是不言而喻的、凡是中華民國的國民、都應該怎樣地扶助牠、保護牠、那裏能夠不顧國貨工厰和許多靠做工過日的職員和工人的生死存亡、還把寳貴的金錢往外國去送呢、</p>
<p>從前、我們的工業沒有發達、差不多衣·食·住·行·四項的東西、本國多沒有出產、就使有些手工生活品、也因為時代的進化而不適合於實用了、所心不得不求之外國、現在那一種工業呂、我們沒有國貨呢、而且有好些國貨要來得價廉物美、那末再去用外國貨、不是喪心病狂了麽？</p>
<p>往外國留過學的人、好像差不多都歡喜用外國貨、可是我並不是說留學生都不愛用國貨、但是的的確確有一部份往外國鍍金的人、最是崇拜着外國貨的、狠不得把自己的臉面、也變成了碧眼黃髮、　好、說起來這些人、都是中華民國的優秀份子、有高深學識的人、這樣的忘本你想痛心不痛心、</p>
<p>根據實業部國際貿易局的調查、我國在二十三年份外國進口貨物價値、要超過輸出的國產品計國幣四萬九千四百四十五萬〇九百四十五元、二十四年份要超過　萬四千三百四十萬二千二百六十二元、單就今年上半年說、也就要超過一萬二千六百二十八萬八千七百七十五元了、諸位、我們國家裏、現在已經經濟枯竭到萬分了、如果再這樣下去、恐怕現在稱為富翁的、也要變成窮人、而目前的窮人、都要成為餓殍了、到了那時、不要別國來用武力侵略、我們已經先要經因濟崩潰而亡國了、這是多麽危險可怕的事情啊、我們不談提倡國貨也到也罷了、否則必須躬自實行對於提倡國貨要像信仰宗敎一樣、從此以後除必須品而為本國沒有的外、發誓不再買任何外國貨、處處存着保全本國財力的心願、我們中華民國才有復興的希望了、</p>
<p>現在時間已到、等有機會時下次再和諸位談談罷、再會、</p>
<h3>本年第二季　上海工商業異動報吿　（續）　（上海工商業概况之三十五）</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>A四月份重要工商行家之異動</p>
<p>甲、金融業方面：</p>
<p>一、川鹽銀行上海分行開幕　該行總行設重慶，分行除上海外復有成都·自流井兩處，並在瀘縣·江津等處設有辦事處，資本總額為國幣二百萬元。近為發展業務計，特在滬新設分行，於十四日宣吿開業。</p>
<p>二、英商美華銀行停業　該行於本年一月十五日與大信實業銀行合組開業，初時為中美合辦，後因美股退出，由英國及華僑加入，故稱英商。曾回香港政府註册，資本定額一百萬元，實收額聞猶未及半數，正式開幕禮甫於本月八日舉行，而三十日竟因四千餘元之微數突吿週轉不靈，致不得不暫停營業。</p>
<p>三、怡成錢號淸理　該號亦稱怡成錢莊，方於三月間開業，號主為裘祖賢君，資本僅數千元，營業迄今，未及一月，卽吿無法維持，殆與美華銀行先後閉歇，亦市面不景氣中一特殊現象</p>
<p>乙、工業方面：</p>
<p>一、辛豐織印綢布厰成立　該厰原為合夥性質，近為擴充營業，經原有股東議决，添招新股、改組為股份有限公司，資本額定二十萬元，業經如數招足，乃於二十四日開創立會，推沈榴邨先生為董事長兼經理</p>
<p>二、仲明機器公司成立　該公司專造仲明式木炭汽車代油爐，設厰於齊齊哈爾路二七〇號，本月一日正式宣吿成立，董事長為范爭波君，經理為湯允靑君。</p>
<p>三、昌明電器公司復業　該厰初時係專製電筒等物後因同業競爭頗烈，主持者鍳於無利可圖，乃專造時鐘，成績頗佳。不意該厰於本年一月間突吿失愼，全部精華，悉付一炬，損失達二十萬元。此次各股東鍳於過去創業之匪易，爰乃重集資本十萬元，新建厰房，重置機器，於本月五日宣吿復業。</p>
<p>四、中華鳳記玻璃厰淸理招盤　該厰原屬日商，後以營業虧蝕，乃讓與華商曹鳳標君經營，營業尚覺可觀，不意「一二八」戰事爆發，該厰因地處前綫，全部燬於砲火。戰後雖由曹君掙扎復業，然不景氣又籠罩各地，該厰卒因營業不振，宜吿淸理招盤。</p>
<p>五、電通公司淸理　該公司於二十三年間以簇新姿態出現於電影界，實收資本十萬元，總經理為馬建德君，營業原稱不惡，近因環境惡劣，無意經營，乃於本月三十日正式宣吿淸理。</p>
<p>丙、商業方面：</p>

<p>（五一）足球賽零比二　吾敗於英</p>
<p>大會足球賽採淘汰制、第一戰我國首遇足球鼻祖英國隊、眞是一件不幸的事情、記者在上次發的通訊課、會經說我國球隊、集全國第一流好手、稱覇遠東、數十年技術、决不下於任何國家的强隊、但體力不如人、推測上半時不致示弱、下半時必定失敗、結果果不出所料、</p>
<p>歐洲各國對我們球隊的實力、好像知道得很詳細、前天一家報紙、預測中英足球賽、上半時各無紀錄、下半時英國可勝兩球、眞是給他猜個正着、英國隊在戰前對我們一點不敢輕視、他們的敎練、並且還耽心會被我國淘汰、英皇為鼓勵他們的選手、發來一個電報、呌他們努力奮鬥、保持國技的榮譽、中英足球大戰、被人重視、於此可見一斑、</p>

<h3>銀行行員的態度該這樣（？）</h3>
<p>— 溪南</p>
<p>年來上海各銀行的分行辦事處，凡是地方商業稍繁盛，住戶較殷實，不論他是東區西區…都得去設立一所。固然是便利，一般人的存放，其實為自己推廣營業作打算。照未來的趨勢，假使銀行對於收支手續，能辦理得盡如人意，誰肯將現欵放置在家裏，自己去擔負風險。何况放在銀行裏，多少還有利息可沾潤，又何樂而不為。</p>
<p>不過照現在各銀行的對付顧客，實在不敢恭維。其中固有不少服務周到，辦事敏捷。但亦有不少好像銀行中所有的黃金白銀，都是他個人的私產。那一般銅臭滿面的神氣，待理不理的態度，拿着報紙消閒，架起一脚談天，好整以暇，讓你等得心焦，站得脚酸，他—行員—老是一副舉動遲緩，東張西望。你如果催他一下，他還要兩眼一瞪，順便奚落你幾聲。故有人說，走進銀行門，好像走進了冷氣門，一股冷氣逼人，令人難堪。世間那有這樣對待顧客之理，有之，只有少數缺乏服務道德不知自愛的行員。</p>
<p>銀行中的重員，他們那裏顧管到這些。其實行員所以敢如是，也是他們做的榜樣。他們日常所施於行員的那副神氣，行員卽以之施於顧客。他們以為這是銀行職員應有的態度，非如此不足以見其為銀行職員。行員為了吃飯，忍受他上級一番傲慢待遇，還是應該，但是顧客眞是他們衣食的來源，反遭行員的白眼，倒因為果，為之一嘆。</p>
<p>如今頗有不少銀行為發展業務起見代收學費，代付薪水，這種為社會服務的精神，深堪欽佩。可是事實又不盡如是，固然也有辦理周到的銀行，但是不少祇知拉奪生意，自己絲毫不作準備。到了收支的日期，櫃台外擁擠了許多人，而他們的應付，仍祇有日常應付這幾個人，無論他做到手忙脚亂，那裏應付得了，結果徒累付學費支薪水的人，白費功夫，催也無效，說也無法，都是這銀行主任辦事不善。你旣要生意，你應預備相當的人力，辦理這件事，或者分期分事之節省人工，均無不可，也應該替收付人設想，他們要幹他們的事情，假使累他們等候多時，不是曠廢了他們的事麽？然而這許多，那裏在銀行主任計擬之中，生意要做的，顧客的困難和便利，毫不為他們顧及，嗚呼，如此行員。</p>
<p>所以，銀行如果要發展他謄本話，莫以為顧客可以任意遭你們怎樣的待遇，你們如果不訓練你們的行員，督促他們，有則改之，無則加勉，那末，無論你們的信用怎樣濃厚，人們也必望望然而去之，那時候六可羅雀，卽是你們期待顧客辦理不善而應有的結果。</p>

<h3>食米售價高定次修　東新粳獨漲二角</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源共到十四五號、貨共三千餘石、惟本街銷塲仍難振起、包胃亦祇威海衛帮辦二百餘包、故如厚薄稻行情雖定、中宿者又見貶短不一、杜洋尖及陰變元平庸、東新因時陰時雨、來貨亦倐减、價獨升二尺、新尖則不過如是而已、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮來源十餘號、市上各色去胃、白粳羊尖新客尖尙活、簿稻平常、餘貨頗懈、市價白粳高貨定局、中次挺立、薄稻羊杜埠尖價格平定變元價小三四分、新客尖小近角、東新粳價加二角、</p>
<h3>漢口新豆削價求售</h3>

<h3>提倡國貨汽車工業</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>國貨工業的發展，本來是和交通建設的進步，成正比例的，而在過去，就因為我國各地交通的阻塞，使國貨產品向內地的推鎖，受了很大的阻礙，影響了整個國貨前途的發展很多</p>
<p>但在這幾年來，全國的公路，却絡續完成，已通車的達九萬餘公里，在計劃及建設中的，也還有三萬餘公里，國產品的向內地惟銷，因此也就跟着交通建設的發展，而得到很六的便利，不過因為我國尙無自辦的汽車工業，全部仰給國外，促起每年漏巵龐大，同時也就發牛了一個利權外溢的嚴重問題。</p>
<p>最近，我聽到一個很可欣喜的消息，那就是我國的實業家，已有鑿於此，發起創設中國汽車製造公司，資本六百萬元，預定設總廠於湖南梧州，並在上海設立分廠，在開工的兩年內，每月出一百輛，五年內則可自造一切機件，以廉價的貨品，供國人購用，這新事業的創立，實在不僅可以挽回利權，並且在我整個的工業上，更見重要，它實是當前國民經濟建設的一大前提。</p>
<p>在這裏，我們更可聯想到木炭汽車的發明，實也是我國工業上的一大收穫，卽由試騐的結果而觀，成續優良，用油極省，所以我們希望全體的工業界，大家一齊來積極地提倡，製造，務使中國當前的交通建設，以及整個的民族工業，推進到一個更新的更高的階段去。</p>
<p>總之，在現下，我們一定要使交通建設事業，與國貨發展打成一片，只有從國貨汽車工業的發展，才能挽回漏巵，與刺激和繁榮工商，也只有從交通建設的地步，才能使國貨的運輸便利，使國貨產品可以深入到邊區各省，全國的窮鄕僻壤去。</p>

<h3>怎樣訪問主婦？</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>主婦是購買國貨的主體，倘使主婦熱心國貨，國貨的出路，當然通行無阻。可是怎樣打開這條出路，便是女訪問員的任務。前天聽到二十五個志願充當女訪問員的發表談話，覺得都有價値，都是經騐豐富，可以當得起這種職務。就她們的意見，可以歸納為八種，倒是提倡國貨上的很好參考：</p>
<p>（一）上午十時以後，不宜訪問主婦，因為她們正要料理餐務，如果嘰哩咕嚕，不但得不到效果，反而惹到人家厭惡。</p>
<p>（二）遇到主婦，不可以開門見山的便說提倡國貨，要隨機應變，不做刻板文章，更不作老生當談，看了當時的情况，發表適當的談話，如見主婦有病，不妨談談病情，如見主婦做針綫，不妨談談縫紉的經騐。遇見小孩，可以談談敎育問題。遇見女伴，可以談談家政問題。總之，引人久勝的談話，是千萬不可少的。</p>
<p>（三）遇到摩登主婦千萬不可批評她們不服用國貨，只有把國貨的優點，逐層講給她們，使她自動的覺悟。尤其不應該談到什麼奢侈和趨時太過，反而惹動她們的惱怒。</p>
<p>（四）遇到頑固的主婦，一次說了無效，不妨第二次光顧，她說今天沒有工夫，明天可以再去，頑石尙可點頭，人類决沒有永遠不會覺悟。</p>
<p>（五）主婦都是歡喜小便宜的，送些優待券或樣品，給她們試用一過，或者可以得到她們的歡迎，在以後訪問時候，可以得到不少效果。</p>
<p>（六）主婦反問我們時候，我們先要站在不敗的地步。譬如她們反問我們是否先自服用國貨，我們可以直捷了當的聲明從頭到脚，沒有一件是非國貨。以身作則，這是我們最緊要的任務。</p>
<p>（七）主婦不願多講話時，我們只好簡單的發語，或者暫吿段落，下次再來說話，嘮嘮叨叨，越發使人厭惡，一定得不到好結果。</p>
<p>（八）說話不宜誇大，更不必一味的講些空泛語，誠誠懇懇，或者可以使人垂顧，采納我們的言語。</p>
<p>我們覺得提倡國貨，不必唱高調，說大話，卽是這八個意見，由女訪問員實地做去，一定可以得到無窮的效果，訪問者與被訪問者都可以感到莫大的樂趣。</p>
<h3>略談盛澤紡綢</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>前天某報載，自入夏以來，一般西國婦女，頗多以西服的不舒適而改穿中國式的長袍，平心而論，在夏天，中服確比較西裝為適合於身體的。</p>
<p>夏天衣服，自以綵綢為最普通，而我們盛澤所塵的紡綢，允能合乎這個季節的需要，現在就共出品，簡單的作一個介紹：盛綢的種類很多，有濮，綾，紗，羅，介，絹之類，普通行銷最鉅而出品最優良的，自推輕新飄逸，白嫩細糯的舫綢了，這種紡綢，輕重闊狹，名目亦有十餘種，大抵輕而狹者，宜於做夾裏，闊重者，宜於做單衫或襯衣之類，夏衣則以鋼簆紡為最耐穿而最合乎經濟條件了。</p>
<p>鋼簆舫有電機與木機兩種，電機則較為勻凈，都是以純天然絲，極纖密的頭紋織成的，因此很耐穿而經洗，洗後，其色調自然會變成肉黃色，頗覺雅淡，穿得久了，加以覆染深色，和新製的亦無分軒輊，較諸舶來品印度綢璧縐等人絲交織品，一經洗染，卽黯然無光，或竟發生破洞，蓋不可同日而語。</p>
<p>至其價値，在原產地每疋不過十三四元，以五丈計算，每尺亦不到三角，無論購買力如何薄弱，總算已合乎平民化了，但大多數的國人們，祗注重於外貨為高貴，為時髦，而功用經濟比較都適宜的國貨，反棄之如敝屣，服之者亦以為土頭土腦，此種自暴自素之習尙，願國人們努力革除！</p>
<h3>祛除國貨運動中不良心理</h3>
<p>— 姚明然</p>
<p>一、虛榮心廠榮心道三個字，差不多大都用在女子身上，常見報章，雜誌，月刋上這樣罵着，我果然不能說虛榮心這三字用得不得當，但是未免太側重於女子方面了，現在的世界，是男女平權的世界，所以虛榮心的制裁，也要共同負責去剷除才行，近幾年來提倡國貨的苦心，不可謂不力，但是所得的効果的微薄，果然由於種種的多方面的關係，可是虛榮心的不能除去，其患害實比有形的金錢外溢，更是厲害，簡直可以說都是它的潛勢力在作祟所致，其唯一的積極的消除方法，便是剛才所說的共同切實負責，而且最易息這毛病的，是少男少女，果由於外界的誘惑，而父母的不去制裁，轉而提倡慫憊的，也不能恕其罪辜，這種心理的亟應改革，是不可再緩的一件大事件！</p>
<p>二、蔑視心說起來眞可憐，又可笑，便是中國人，往往蔑視國貨，對於這絕無僅有的國貨文字，記載等的提倡，都認為無效，不値一看，果然文字的宣傳，無濟於事，然而由此可以證明國人的蔑視國貨的程度，和對於國貨諷識的缺乏，他們以為老生常談，不知道國貨的不能發展，這種心理的障碍，看是不値一談，實在是影響於國貨的發展前途，有重大的危機，禍常起於微忽之中，」方孝孺的深慮論中的這句名霄，直可以値得靑年，老少們玩味一下，西方有句名言，「從服從它中去控制它，」現在處在這樣一個情勢之下，國貨如此衰落之中，我們不能因此而失望，消極，任它去鉗减，我們須從困鬥中求出路，但是要達到這一步，更非空話所能辦到，不先打倒這樣的國貨蔑視心的障碍，我恐永不會有良好的出頭計哩！</p>
<p>以上所說的兩個不良心理，看是平淡無奇，實則非常重要，因為說得太多使允耳不，聞便不去注意了，希望竭力共同負責，指日消滅這兩大仇敵！現在國貨運動，頗見風行，所以特地寫述出來，希望有則改之，無則加勉。</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （逸梅）</p>
<p>我之治事處，適鄰殯儀館，哭聲時從林木問傳來，觸耳悽絕，然聽之償常，漸覺若無其事，且於生死問題，視之甚輕，名利心為之益淡。我恨不能盡驅世之患熱中病者，一一與殯儀館作比鄰居也。</p>
<p>乘電車作長距離之行者，一時雖不得座，及經若十站，必獲座以安憇，讀書作事，須持之以恒，觀此益信。</p>
<p>人不如禽，故市聲難比鳥鳴之幽。人不如蟲，故囂遠遜蛩吟之細。</p>
<p>日之，矣，一二老傭工，跣足科頭，就離根樹下，支板為桌，移矮凳以進晚飯，望之似在畫幅中覺其舒適快樂，雖任何肴館餐室，不能及也。</p>
<p>暄譁之譁字，世俗大都作口旁，不作言旁，成為嘩字，大誤。甚至我輩舞文弄墨者，亦多寫喧譯為喧嘩，抑何可笑。</p>
<p>我有滿腔血，擬麗之荒磧朔漠之間。我有兩行淚，欲揮之綠酒紅燈之候。</p>
<p>摩登靑年大都認影史舞經為必修之課。</p>
<p>籃新荷葉，煎一透，然後去葉存汁，煮成粥。厥色淺碧，味允淸香可喜，初秋佳食品也。</p>
<h3>外人筆下的中國</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>美國人亞脫里氏，曾來華作三個月的旅行。回美之後，在「美國人雜詰」上，發表了一篇遊記。他開首便說，實際的中國，是和我們理想中的不同的。我們一脚跨上了上海的外灘，我幾乎疑心着這是西方的一個大商埠，而幾乎不信着這是一般所說的甚麼都落後的中國。所見的，只是巍蛾的大厦，和現代的文明，所交織成的美麗的一片而已。</p>
<p>上海的城隍廟，雖然在秩序方面，稍欠整齊，但是東方色彩，却是沒有比這更濃重的了。狹窄的街道，古老的建築，到處都顯示着中國的文明，是歷史所造成的？威尼斯城是歐洲的」個古城，但在威尼斯，已很難見到歷史的齒痕了，因為一切都已改造得近代化了。埃及和印度，大抵都已把歷史的文明，埋藏在地下了。在上海的城隍廟中，我人才可以見到中古時代的文明，不是在舞臺上，在銀幕上，所搬演着的中古時代的文明。</p>
<p>北平所給與的印象，也極深。修長的胡同，充滿着不寂寞的靜寂。雖然住在古舊的中國式的大宅子裏，欠缺着一切近代化的生活的設施，但是住在其中，其舒適是很難為住居在美國的人，所想像得到的。北平，是具有着古文明的軀壳，具有着現代文明的精神的。其環境可適於黃種人，也可適於白種人？可週於久居，也可適於旅行。總之，任何人在北平，都是找得其所宜的適當的角度，比方廣州，漢口，天津，靑島等地，都强，甚至，於上海，都够不上北平的美麗與神秘。更其是北平的氣候，比了上海好　很有些德國北部的風味。</p>
<p>雖然在中國，也會見到過一般的遊記與小說中，所說的髮辮與小足，但却並不多，更其是髮辮，簡直的不怎麼看得見了，在中國，婦女們，也已有很多，把髮辮都剪掉了。男子蓄有髮辮的，似乎僅限於農人與轎夫的二個階級。婦人的小足，似乎比較普遍些，但是在四十歲以下的婦女，也很少具有小足的，而且已有很多，也穿着高跟鞋，習着跳舞，仿效着好萊塢的女明星生活。交通在中國，雖不能說是極度的發達，但在現代的中國，旅行者已可利用着火車與汽車，而旅行中國的廣大的領土的十分之七。但是在中國，據說任何一種方言，很難通行於千哩之外，這是一個缺點。但在各國大都市間，却能用英語相接觸，毫無困難。</p>
<h3>吳越史地研究會成立紀</h3>
<p>— 衛聚賢</p>
<p>在有史以前，中國民族由南而北，文化亦是由南而北。到了有史以後，有一部分民族由北而南，不應以南方的文化物由北方遷來的。欲證明這種假定，在江南已有新石器發現，可證明江南文花之早。而石器遺址中的陶器均為幾何形花紋，與黃河流域石器時代陶器上花紋完全不同。可證明江南自有文化，而不是受北方的傳播。</p>
<p>這種事實之證明，發源於南京古物保存所於民國十九年在南京棲霞山附近發現石器及幾何花紋陶器，繼起則為在常州的奄城，金山的戚家墩有大批幾何形陶器發現，有奄城金山訪古紀出版。於是引起大家注意，本年二月開古泉學會時，由吳稚暉葉玉甫等商談，成立吳越史地研究會，草擬簡單，徵求會員，於籌備期間，在蘇州發現吳城越城姑蘇臺隨娃宮，昨浦墩浦，紹興等處，發現大批幾何形花紋陶器，在杭州古蕩發現大批石器，有杭州古蕩新石器時代遺址之試探報吿一書出版。</p>
<p>昨日吳越史地研究會在上海八仙橋靑年會雪庚堂開成立大會，到蔡孑民等百餘人，並有古蕩湖州的石器，紹與松江金山等處的陶器，餘姚的磁器等陳列，各界觀者數百人。開會時通過簡章，選舉蔡孑民為會長吳稚暉鈕惕生為副會長，于右任孔庸之葉玉甫陳立夫等為評議，會旣成立，對於吳越的古文化，當然積極的工作，但江浙兩地當不少石器陶器，而尙未發現，除聘江浙兩省各縣敎育局局長及民衆敎育館館長為調查委員會當然委員外，又聘請各縣的中小學史地國文敎員為調查員，担任調查本地的古跡古物。江蘇各縣由吳越史地研究會寄教育局長古物樣本十冊送給各中小學史地國文敎員作參考。浙江各縣，將由西湖博物館分送。希望各處遇有石器及幾何形花紋陶器時，函吿上海中央銀行衛聚賢，以便派員前往調查。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第六回　鐵面見親心語瞞鸚鵡　蛾眉存俠氣典開崑崙</p>
<p>這種人，在現時早已落伍。在那時，也很不為老先生所喜。因為那並不合於婦德婦容婦言婦工四個條件。這日，正為了小姐的事，來和太太談心。現在小菊送上這一塊眼淚濕透了的手絹，他如何能不問。他見小菊果站在太太身邊，便問道：好端端的，小姐為什麼哭？小菊道：小姐在床上睡覺，沒有哭。不過我看到他手上揑着的手絹，是透濕的，我猜他哭了。江浩然又吸了兩袋烟，眼睛對手絹望着，因道：太太，你對於女兒，太嬌慣了。這樣好的手絹，讓他拿去擦眼淚。江太太笑道：也許是他灑的花露水。江浩然道：你看，這就是你的不對。小菊都說出來了，他已經在哭。你還巷他遮藍，說這手絹上洒了花露水。你聞聞香不香？江太太道：唉！小孩子們總不免鬧一點脾氣的。男孩子頑皮，女孩子喜歡哭，家家如此。不理他，也就完了，何必追問。浩然搖了一搖頭道：不是那便說。今天這一哭，多少有些原因。剛才你不是說，把新作的衣服，讓他試過了嗎？你還說，他穿了衣服，還照了一照鏡子，我就不相信這話。小菊，你去把小姐呌了來，我有話問他。江太太也板了臉道：女兒的婚事，只要父親作主就是了。那些枝枝節節的小事，全是娘的事，一個作父親的，怎好去同他說話。浩然道：現在吃午飯了，也該四他下樓。他來了，我不過問他幾句話，和他講一點道理，决不駡他就是了。小菊站在桌子角落裏，慢慢的向後退，退得全無路可走了。只管低了頭，把兩隻眼珠亂轉。浩然將二個指頭尖，拍了桌子沿道：呌你去請小姐的，你還在這裏作什麼？小菊望了一望太太，太太對他，微微點了兩點下巴顎。小菊這就一步一步挨出房門，然後一溜烟的，跑上樓去。夢蘭被他咯咯的脚步聲驚醒，坐起來揉着眼請。小菊走進來，先仲了一伸舌頭，然後笑道：我惹了禍事了。夢蘭道：你又打破了什麼東西？小菊輕輕的把剛才的事，吿訴了一遍。夢蘭皺了眉，把脚一頓道：你眞多事！小菊道：我也是好意，看到你把手絹也哭濕了，很可憐的。我想告訴了大太，讓他心疼疼疼你。夢蘭聽說，倒不由得噗嗤一聲笑，因道：這倒成了那句成語，猪八戒照鏡，裏外不是人了。好罷，我下樓去。若是挨打的話，看你也過意不過意。（六九）</p>
<h3>水老鴉</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>「水老鴉，」卽烏類，不過此為水禽，彼為林鳥，其大別也，色純黑，形如鳧，而較大，驟視之，若無眼，實非無眼，以羽毛與眼胞相溷，故不見也。厥性嗜魚，故漁家豢之，其善攫魚者，極貴一頭須二三十元不等，次亦須十餘元，而飼之亦不易，以是水老鴉非繁殖之禽類，而識之者，亦遂尠焉。</p>
<p>吾邑育水老鴉者，以東南戰浜鄉，及費家邨為最多，每値農隙，恒以一葉扁舟，手僅持一篙，立於船尾，搘之而行，船之兩舷，皆水老鴉樓之，為數可十餘頭。入城河，以足踏船板，其聲撻撻，震於水濱，乃驅水老鴉為首者先泅，餘皆依次以爭入，霎時俱沒水不見。船前進，而水老鴉亦一往直衝，遇魚卽搏，得之而上浮，以示獻俘之意。舟人見之，恐其下咽，輒以一竿鈎之至，於共喙中挖其魚，復驅之入水，有所獲者，皆如法以待，而水老鴉亦如爭功，莫或稍懈，以斯時魚之在兩岸巢穴中者，為聲所震，欲逃避而滴墮共口，無一能逸也。間有巨大之魚，不足以敵，且合羣力以圍之，猶懼勿勝，乃啄其目，先使之盲，然後擒之以起，水老鴉之勇，亦可見已。</p>
<p>唯水老鴉有一特性，卽生卵而不能孵育，故祗得取其卵，俾母鷄代共勞，然孵化後，鷄以其不類，舍之不顧，仍須以人力助其長成，日以小魚及尼鰍等，搗爛而喂之，其宿則以塒，中架橫木，使棲息其間，至能捕魚時，先以熖草心搓成之細錢扣其頸，故得魚不能下咽，而兩足復以繩連擊，得以竿鈎之，此水老鴉之所以能就範，而為漁家之所利用者，亦卽在此。日前友人某君，見是物而異之，爰濡筆誌其大略如上。</p>
<p>人物小誌</p>
<h3>小明星秀蘭鄧波兒成功史</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>七歲的秀蘭鄧波兒，在好萊塢，一九三五年度竟成了一個最受人愛戴的明星。伊每一個禮拜可接到三千五百封影迷的來信，目前伊在電影城中，已被一家擁有資本美金五千四百萬元的影片公司當做重要的資產了。伊是一個矮身段的女孩子，伊的面上看去沒有病象，但也沒有驚人的地方。伊在七歲時害過一次麻疹，不久就送進好萊塢的一個跳舞學校，這舞校便是一般想上銀幕的孩子們的進身之階。兩頰的酒渦，生得很美，黃色的頭髮，由伊的媽媽親手捲成的。最初伊會被一個舞校中偵察的人選擇伊做一部敎育片中的童角，為了獲得意外的成績，接着伊的銀幕生活便開始了。鄧波兒夫人對於伊的女兒，那時每天是特別的關心着，聽說有製片公司需要童角，便去應徵。一九三四年度，秀蘭鄧波兒在福斯影片公司拍攝小娃娃」一片，成績是特別驚人，從此伊便一天聞名一天，登上銀星之路。不過好萊塢的影片公司，對於童星向來是很薄待的，他們更不明白童星的眞價値，所以最初福斯對於秀蘭鄧波兒也並不重視，第一次祗給予伊在一部影片中擔任不重要的童角，結果伊的成功，使人發現到伊有特殊的電影抵一九〇，〇〇〇元，可是在三星期內，所獲得的已超過社數了。秀蘭鄧波主演的影片，成本都是很輕的，大致每部在二〇〇，五〇〇，〇〇〇元。除了故事的編寫而外，演員和背具似乎不很重要的。根據合同所就，秀蘭鄧波每年為福斯攝製影片四部，每部得報酬七五，〇〇〇元，其餘每星期一〇，〇〇〇元的收入，是由十五家大公司出售內衣，外衣，玩具，書籍，木偶等物，用伊的照片來當做商標或廣吿而報效。除了拍戲之外，在好萊塢，秀蘭鄧波兒更是一個播音明星，伊的幾支名歌，已印行過四〇〇，〇〇〇部考斯貝這個數字，比平考期貝，珍妮麥克唐的名歌，銷數更好了。</p>
<p>這樣的年齡，能够這樣的受人愛戴，那麼伊的私生活怎樣，這當然也是很够引人注意的。事實上伊是一個和普的女孩子，什麼都服從伊的媽媽。年齡雖然這樣小，但對於工作是極端愛好而努力的。不大害病，衣服並不十二分的華麗，但很整潔。伊早上七時就起身了，隔晚讀過的書，念過幾遍，然後到野外去學習舞蹈的步法。伊的早餐，包括鮮果，穀食，煮蛋，接着便和伊的媽媽到福斯攝影塲去拍戲。工作完畢而後，回到家裏，在伊媽媽督促之下，學習各種功課。就伊的程度說來，好像是一個九歲的孩子了。伊明年起要學習法文，可能的話，伊或許將攝製一部用法語對白的聲片。五時半，伊白天的工作完畢，回到家裏和伊的爸爸在一起玩刻，然後預備明天的功課。伊的天性是慣會模仿的，當伊拍攝小伯爵」一片時，在四十五呎高樓梯上下來，每一個轉灣要用舞蹈的步法，攝影師把鏡箱對準了拍攝影片，能够使樓梯的每一條綫，顯明的攝出，的確不是容易的一件事，但結果成績倒是不錯，而且伊的步法和扶梯的錢條，竟沒有一些參差。伊對於工作是非常高興的，拍戲的時候，好像別個女孩子玩洋囡囡一樣的便當為了伊有充分的藝術天才，所以訓練起來很容易。當伊在拍攝一部影片之前，祗要導演對伊說明了這一個鏡頭之中，伊要怎樣的表演，聽過一遍，伊便什麼都明白了。不但自己，連得別個演員的戲，伊也知道。開始拍戲而後，伊如果偶一不俱，有了錯誤，伊便立刻會關照揮影師重拍。當伊拍攝「小伯爵」片時，曾經跌過一交，跌在義費電燈上面，更有一次在閘門時軋痛了伊的手。伊是一個多感的小姑娘，當伊抱着一個洋囡囡時，如果洋囡囡的手偶然落掉一隻，伊便會哭泣起來，至少要半小時靜默着不快活。在福斯的攝影塲中，伊養着幾頭兎午和小鷄，每天要覆個鷄蛋回去，明天吃早餐。自己的照片，伊曾收集了不少，將來伊也許會成功一個全世界最有名的集影家呢！</p>
<p>秀蘭鄧波兒的成功，結果竟使伊的家庭突然的富裕起來，現在鄧波兒先生已製了一所新里，這屋子一面是山，一面有一塊廣大的草地，以避去走過的人在窗口張望秀蘭鄧波兒。伊有兩個哥哥，鄧波兒先生的生活，最近起了一種變化，他在銀行之中，已由一個變通的職員，升任分行的經理了。他也是一個短小的人，別的婦女時常會突如其來，請他去零會，為的是伊們想討敎鄧波兒先生，使伊們的女兒也有做秀蘭鄧波兒第一而上銀幕的機會。然而對於這種請帖，鄧波兒先生一概拒絕的。鄧波兒夫人伊每星期也由福斯給伊五百元作為管領秀鄧波兒的酬勞。</p>

<p>淋濁自療</p>
<h3>萬試不爽的淋病有效療法</h3>
<p>— 香港醫科大學醫學學士吳大超</p>
<p>淋病雖然頑固難治，但據我的多年臨診經騐，的確並有如傳說者的厲害，祇要病者遵守攝身法，避免操勞，用一種黃色素和伐克辛合制劑『安敵淋』內服，决定沒有困難的事件發生，如在急性期服用，絕不會轉入慢性而暴發其他併發病的危險，因為該藥所含的成分，除有透膜殺菌的功效外，還有抵抗毒菌的菌苗，散佈在你的血液精髓中，使可惡的淋病雙球菌無由侵入。多者兩月，少則半月，恢復生機，回返康健。該藥之最足使人推崇者，為治愈後的永不復發，余在此兩年內，以『安敵淋』治愈患淋者至少在三千以上，而愈後因復發來覆診者，絕無發現，上月余以『安敵淋』治愈急性期內患者，前後服藥祇二星期即已根治，此為患者服『安敵淋』根治之最速者，特錄之，以供借鏡。</p>
<p>患者施姓，年廿九歲，住本埠白克路同春坊，彼因一度冶游之後，不到五日，即暴發白濁，小便刺痛，龜頭腫賬，全身發寒發熱，陰莖全部抽痛難忍，夜間因痛而陷於不能安睡，余診治之後，即以『安敵淋』服之，服後渠即感覺疼痛减輕，排尿順利，五日之後，尿道口之白色粘液大减，十日後竟覺完全消失，渠祇服『安敵淋』兩盒，急性之淋病根治無遺，余用顯微鏡檢騐其尿液，確已無濁，可謂速矣。</p>
<h3>乳峯美的必要條件</h3>
<p>— 劉志民醫師</p>
<p>女子的束胸，已經是被醫學界證明有妨碍身體的康健，所以凡是研究康健的女子，莫不解放她的胸部。果然，高高的乳峯，自有一種令人欽羨的魔力，已經成為現代女性美容的典型。的確為現代女生不能缺少的條件，這是誰都不能否認的。因為它有但顯示健美的恣態，而且愈是膨脹高聳，愈能證明她衛生的成功。不過這種成功，不是身體衰弱的女子所能期望，因為身體衰弱的女子，她的發育被生殖腺衰弱所限制，不能得到美滿的收獲，所以臀部特別狹窄，乳峯萎癟，精神不振，而且這種女子，大都還有病態，如子宮障碍，月经不调等，也是数见不鲜的，试想这种女子是否永远不能享康健的福了吗？不，现在医学家早已发明了生殖腺素製剂女用『生殖素』，大凡乳瘪，身弱，月經不調的女子都可藉它偉大的藥力，得到滿意的解决。</p>
<p>通俗醫藥</p>
<h3>骨節有效療法的借鏡</h3>
<p>— 周笑涵醫師</p>
<p>骨痛的病狀，最輕者為工作後感覺之腰背酸痛，此外為兩肩膀及全身骨骱的酸痛，病症較重者則全身由疼痛而麻木，甚至陷於半身不遂，還有手足拘攣，痛苦非凡，病源的由來，不外早年的縱慾過度，血分不潔，此外尿强酸過多，或飽受風寒，瘋濕因此內蘊，抵抗力薄弱者，不到老年，即已爆發，故治療之法，應施早期療法，服以去毒除風的對症良藥，即可根治。</p>
<p>患者章直敏，年四十八歲，因年輕時荒淫過度，血分因之不潔，加之寒暖不愼，瘋濕內蘊，近三年來全身感覺骨痛甚劇，痛時竟不能動作，僵臥床上，形成半身不遂之狀，經過旬日之後，始得减輕，一年至少要發三四次，上年冬由至戚介紹服以『强斯登氏骨痛片』之後　，骨節輕鬆，腰背爽適，至今十月，從未一發云。可謂幸矣！</p>
<p>夫婦智識</p>
<p>— 美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚爾昌著</p>
<h3>男女婚後生理及疾病的指導</h3>
<p>大凡一對夫婦，能够照醫理來履行生理上的衛生，一定是能享受幸福的，不但康健却病，而且可以處長壽命，反是，則體質的虧損，壽命的縮短，痛苦是不能避免的。</p>
<p>這是甚么緣故呢？雖有多種的原因，但是對於夫婦間的性生活最為重要，善能攝生的人，他對於生理所必需的性慾，一定很調節。實際上一對夫婦能履行有規律的性生活，是能增加腰股部分的脂肪質，這個緣故，固然由於調節生活的不損精神，一方面因為生理上所生的精液與消耗平衡後，精液中所產生的一種酵素，愈能促進對方體內的新陳代謝，受此滋潤精神與肉體，都欣欣向榮了。</p>
<p>所以最危險的人，厥為婚後縱慾無度，不知不覺間，就把寶貴的身體損傷了。這種人，起初是很强壯的，慢慢的衰弱下去，竟致到了不可收拾的境地，丹顏豐額的美少年，結婚不出數月，肌削骨立，身體衰頹，這是屢見不鮮的事實，</p>
<p>還有很多的事實，當靑年在未婚時濫施手淫，遺精不息，此種人婚後多爆發早洩，陰萎等症，有的涉足花叢，染來淋病，精囊被淋菌所侵蝕，生殖腺破壞，婚後不能行夫婦之道。屬於女子者，婚前體質素弱的，每罹月經不調症，妊娠困難，夫婦間易生裂痕，所以結婚的人們，是應該特別留意作更進一步的藥力補救，欲求藥不虛設，應各服純粹生殖腺素製劑，男用女用「生殖素」以澈底旺盛其生殖腺，作有力的補救，該藥可使內分泌增加，新陳代謝的能力層出不窮，月經調整如婚前曾染淋病，患有遺精的，應速再以「希米脫氏固精片」治之，這樣就可以除掉種種障碍，夫婦間行以圓滿好合，增進健康，獲毓寧馨兒，以完成做人的使命</p>
<p>自療常識</p>
<h3>遺精損害精關的程度及治療方法的推荐</h3>
<p>— 任國祥醫師</p>
<p>要知道遺精損害精關的程度，必定先要論述遺精何由而起，在很多的遺精靑年中，無疑地他們已經曉得完全是手淫惡癖所促成。尤其在早期若犯手淫癖，那種弊害眞是大得很，非但能於極短期間變為滑精，并且陷發育於絕境，特別性器發育受其損害，雖達成年，生殖器狀態一如小兒，原因由於早年期身體發育尚未完成，一旦因手淫惹成遺精後，不但微弱的精關，易為破壞，且刺戟腦神經過甚，當然能使司生殖器發育的腦下垂體機能發生障碍；而且這時其內分泌液缺乏，當然生殖器發育就會停止了。而精神就會不濟，肌肉大加瘦削，盜汗，耳鳴，顏色蒼白，這差不多為遺精頻繁後無可逃避的病症。</p>
<p>在大體上言，一個人旣爆發了遺精之後，就是證明其人已陷在危險所包圍中了，如處置不善，則終身被此危險所包圍而不能突出。所以遺精必須尅止，不過遺精後因身體斵喪過度，神經衰弱症必須治好，如不施有效的療法，眞談不到康健了，現在有一種很好的療法，藥力可使鬆懈的精關恢復到銅墻鐵壁的一樣鞏固，並且能使腦神經淸楚，夢幻減少，神經衰弱症亦可根治。此方法屢得到驚人的效騐，治愈的指不勝屈了，現在有一患者，亦實行此法始得恢復康健，尅制遺精。特推荐在這裏，以供參考。</p>
<p>患者羅秋雲，年廿一歲，十七歲時實行手淫後，因體質素弱，夢遺不久，卽變滑精，肌肉削瘦，精神疲備，在稍一刺戟之後，能將精液流出，故渠的生殖器不必勃起，即可遺出，施行多方療法，從未見效，今年四月得朋友介紹，每晚肯德基前服「希米脫氏固精片」之後精關大加鞏固，同時以生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」根治其神經衰弱症。故腦神經淸楚異常，身體及精神也非常强壯，不至兩月，遺精完全治好，身壯體健與前判若兩人矣。</p>
<p>戒烟心得</p>
<h3>培補戒煙法确具功效！</h3>
<p>— 賈治中醫師</p>
<p>鴉片的成癮甚易，戒絕則甚難，原因由於血液中中了煙毒之後，則血中之赤血球被刺激而產生無數的『血小板』各器管的細胞得此『血小板』而得維持不正當活力，如一旦停止吸煙，『血小板』之數量大减，白血球因之停滯於血管內，不作運輸工作，而各器管之細胞完全失去保障，身體及精神，則呈種種不安之狀矣，故戒時受此不安的牽累，每至中途失敗，惟有培補戒煙法能增强體內的抗毒能力，故戒時全不覺若何痛苦，反覺精神勝常。</p>
<p>戒者王善才，洞庭山人，經商於無錫，今年卌四歲，吸烟已八年矣，今年四月來滬求戒，當指導用培補戒煙法服以『生殖素』以增强體力，滋補全身，同時注射『育維賜保命』，當服藥之初，即覺烟量大减，連續服三盒之後，烟癮完全戒除，面色轉為紅潤，精足神旺，體重與食慾均增，前後祇六星期，戒期至短，且痛苦毫無云。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>作戰方式須合乎人道</h3>
<p>— 周戈</p>
<p>西班牙的「內戰」自七月十八日摩洛哥的駐軍叛變起至今日，已有一個多月了，非但雙方攻擊並未停止，而其殺戮的殘酷，據說是歷史上空前的參象。</p>
<p>本來，戰爭本身是殘酷的，一砲轟去，血肉橫飛，有位小說家描寫戰地情况，說熱血飛濺，猶如萬朶紅花，而在那萬朶紅花，手脚作亂舞於其中，君等試瞑目一想，其殘酷之狀可得而知之了！</p>
<p>因此英國政府向西班牙非正式的調停中，提出多項辦法中的第一項就是：「作戰方式須合乎人道。」怎樣才是合乎人道的作戰方式呢？難道戰爭要合乎人道就得如小孩子的「雪戰」那樣，旣不傷人，而又感興趣呢？然而這種「作戰方式」明明又是各帝國主義國家所不願的，因為那樣，無異是拆自己的檯脚啊！</p>
<p>說是作戰的方式要合乎人道，然是把一個敵人殺得「文明」些，例如「斬首」，改為「槍斃」，槍斃改為「電椅」，最好電椅改為吃「安眠藥水」，那是挺挺的人道主義的「穀法」了！然而在急性的戰爭中，肓目的戰爭中，這稱慢性的「殺法」，却是無濟於事的呀！而且卽是殺得「合乎人道」，把一個活活的生命置之於死地呀！</p>
<p>所以我說要作戰的方式合乎人道，就是根本廢除戰爭。然而要根本廢除戰爭，還是需要「戰爭」來消滅「戰爭」的呀！</p>
<h3>刺蝟</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>傍晚時分，當太陽西斜掩上西山脚下，殘留的陽光掛上大院子里的樹梢上，蟬兒在唱，牆頭上狗尾草在晚風中搖擺着。</p>
<p>院子，稱得起相當的巨大，除了四合房子（註）以外，當中的面積是正方形，縱和橫都有兩丈開外的尺寸，地下舖着大的方磚，除了東西和南北四個屋子的門前，必要的那兩條交叉的行道外，把其餘的地方，闢了四面土池子，里面種了些可愛的花草，號且，還紥了一個大葡萄架，在南屋的門前，人走在下面，讓纍纍地葡萄垂下來，看着牠由靑綠轉成了紫色，那樣子，很像大天棚（註）。</p>
<p>一到這個時候，祖母拉開了笑臉，搬出了竹床，小凳子，泡一壺金銀花的淸茶，自己把那根保用了五六年的水烟袋也捧出來，打着扇子，烟絲一次一次的裝上去，也一次一次的將殘灰吐到土池子里去。</p>
<p>當時，在我們的姊妹兄弟之中，我要算最受祖母寵愛的一個，於此，能安詳的讓我躺在竹床上，用大的芭蕉扇趕去了毒惡的蚊子，高興的時候，還會哼上兩句呌不出來的小曲。逐漸的，昏暗從天宇拉下了牠的羽翼，沿了葡萄架，有時沿了那牆根，幾個小動物在爬行，灰白色，身體國圓地，爬得並不快，用鼻子在地面上不住的嗅着，像要發覺點什麼似的，大概是已經慣常了，牠不怕人，漸次的有近了竹床——</p>
<p>——奶奶，刺蝟，刺蝟，說着，跳下了床，用脚一踢，那身體便捲成了一個圓團，俯伏着不動了，把頭捲進去不敢出來，周身的刺，抵禦外來的侵害。</p>
<p>它們常常在老的率領之下會魚貫的走出了一羣，據祖母的傳說，這動物是具有些神之氣的，越多的地方，無論在人丁以至事業上都會繁榮的。這話，我明白在阻止我們的加害，有時我會笑，牠和我間沒有怨恨，為什麼我要去加害牠呢？</p>
<p>因了好奇，也曾經請問過我們的塾師，可是所得的答案，仍很模糊。後來，隔院的張家媽媽吿訴我，刺蝟在年份多了的時候，眼睛會變成紅的，像兎兒一樣，牠怕野狐，不管牠團縮得怎樣緊，禁不住野狐的一泡騷尿，那味兒能使牠耐不住的，這就很快的送掉了弱小的生命。於是我想人尿牠會不會受到損害呢？</p>
<p>偷偸地，趁祖母午睡的時候，的好了張家和李家的弟弟，拿着小棍子，追尋到牠們每日出入的那個小跨院。那里，除了些零磚碎瓦以外，架在兩牆之間的，搭有一隻棚子，底下放些不中用的破爛。先看一下磚堆，沒有裂痕能容牠們的藏身，又鑽在破爛里面胡亂的翻着，結果，發現牠們都躱在爛棉花的底下睡得正濃。意外的突擊給了牠們不少的驚嚇，一共有十幾隻，慌張的看着我們</p>
<p>——我們也撒泡尿試試看！提議的是我，小心靈里存了奇特的想念，當然不會得到否議。</p>
<p>——誰撒呢？不用說當然是我，於是我們把一個較大的滾出來，撒着，撒着，眼睛釘射着牠的身體，可是牠沒有動，一直等撒完了很久，牠依然的不動</p>
<p>——大概人的尿不及野狐的騷尿？這個謎永遠藏在心底深處。</p>
<p>之後，我被送上了社會的熔爐，之後，祖母蒼老的死去，再尋不回來那愛護的溫慈，之後，離開了那院子，離開了那一隻刺蝟，到江南一轉眼，八個年頭過去了。</p>
<p>在江南，看不見那圖球樣的動物，現在，葡萄又將到紅的時候，在葡萄架下，在傍晚時分，或許那弱小的生命照舊的在活動吧？</p>

<h3>老馬夫</h3>
<p>— 啓瑩</p>
<p>——山行雜記之三</p>
<p>東方的天際剛現出一綫曙光的時候，我們一夥子四個人又起程了，因為我們訐劃今天必須趕大龍山北邊的山脚下才下宿。急急地行着，在上山的小路上，我們不時地回過腦袋來看，昨晚會經住過山峽中的小廟，籠罩在飄浮的霧氣中了，叢蓬的濃綠色的梧桐樹葉掩蓋了它整個的面目，只能隱隱地看見它硃紅色的屋頂，靜穆，瀟洒。使我們對於這詩意的山峽，深深地威到留變，脚步却不知不覺地放慢了。</p>
<p>翻過了山峯，突然一條平坦的大路現在我們的眼前了。路頭上有一兩家賣茶的凉棚，寂寞得沒有一個息脚的行人。老闆娘都翹着屁股在爐前生火。一家凉棚中，坐着一個老人，在悠閒地吸旱烟袋，把一箋腿子放在一條長板凳上面，眼睛注視着路頭。這時，看見我們走向山峯上來了，他便趕忙地拖着鞋子跑到我們的面前來。</p>
<p>「先生，先生，您家們是不是到北邊的山脚下，趕到南昌府去的啊！」老人緊問着我們，和藹地笑着：「先生，騎我的馬去，我的馬脚步又穩，又快，都是些嫩馬，包使你先生們滿意，」他用着作急的照光望了我們一眼，看我們沒有回答，接着又說道：「先生，我的馬在那邊山空中放募，您家們要騎的話，我馬上就去牽來！」</p>
<p>這眞使我們喜出望外，在這深山荒</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>野難行的路途上，我們已經走了相近一千里的路了，從來沒有一件東西來代替我們疲勞的步伐。今天聽說有馬騎，我們都無問題的答應了。</p>
<p>老人將我們領到茶棚中坐下來，他便跑去放馬了。半身腰中，他又氣急地趕回來：「先生，先生，跟您家們說好，答應騎我的馬去，就得騎我的馬去，隨您家們把我幾個錢都可以！」</p>
<p>老人不放心似的說準騎他的馬去，老人便又滿意地向山腰中跑去！</p>
<p>茶棚下風凉得像秋天，太陽才在東方山的盡頭露出他半邊血紅的臉子。幾聲樹梢上的蟬鳴，和遠處山腰中不時地傳來的犬吠聲，增加了我們跋踄者的寂寞感。</p>
<p>老闆娘和藹笑着走近我們的身來，也招攬着她的生意：「先生喝了我們的茶再去，天氣還早，爐子上的水要不了一下子的工夫就開了！」</p>
<p>老人將馬放來了，半山腰中就聽見了馬頸上的「叮噹，叮噹」的銅鈴聲。那是幾匹瘦得只看見骨頭，和老人一樣衰弱的老馬。不等老人將馬鞍子駕好，我們便騎着趕路了。老人緊追在我們的身邊，為我們捆着馬鞍子上面的帶子，我們只顧抽着馬鞍跑着，他落在我們後面，上氣不接下氣地呌道：「先生，慢一點，慢一點呵！前面的路不好走呀，小心落到山谷中去呵！」</p>
<p>最後，他急了聲音幾乎近於哭泣：「先生，我的馬有病呵，有病呵！」</p>
<p>遠遠地還聽得見茶棚店里的老闆娘的呌聲：「先生，喝了我的茶再去，天氣還早呀，老爹（呌老馬夫）你為什麽呌先生們這麽早　　路呀？」</p>
<h3>肥豬</h3>
<p>— 里節</p>
<p>這是常常會使慶根癩痢從睡覺中做着響夢笑醒來的：「嘿嘿嘿嘿……肥豬……肥豬」他老婆總是嚕哩嚕蘇的罵他：「你這不該寳的猴孫，豬是肥了，摸摸你自己身上瘦得像什麽了，癆病鬼！日夜喂豬食，日夜填窠，瞧你結果跟誰忙？」這些話有時亦挑起慶根癩痢的哀愁。因為外邊早有風聲，說是阿虎爺爺要來秤他的豬，當然並不付現錢買，是抵銷老債的，好幾年來慶根癩痢沒養起豬。阿虎爺爺再怎樣緊逼，總抓不住他的辮子，這次可難逃了？「要是真有這麼一着兒，」阿虎想想；「那半年多的心血就完全落空……」</p>
<p>黃昏時候，慶根癩痢又把他老婆燒好的滿滿一桶豬食送進後門口豬窠去，「似乎又肥了些兒？」這成為一種心理作用，其實他的那頭豬已長到宰殺期，再肥也肥不起來了。不是嗎？牠的肚子已掛到地，走起來像滾石春，要是豬窠裏會有一面鏡子，把骨瘦如柴的慶根癩痢和他的肥豬同照在裏面，或許，這情景所挑起他的哀感就更深一層。然而這在慶根癩痢自己是木然。他用盡氣力把那桶食料傾下石槽，空桶擱置豬圈柵外，透一口氣，面朝裏坐在跟他背景一樣凸起的豬窠屋門檻上，不息地　着沒甚光彩的眼睛，又打起「肚皮算盤」來。</p>
<p>「賣給肉墩上不合算，一則毛老三的錢不爽快，二則自己連板油湯貨都落不着吃。要是在七月半殺，自己向鄰近村子上兜吃戶，有一斤算一斤，錢是現的，七月半祭祖，家家都得用點肉，不愁銷不完，自己留個豬頭，肺，腸……一家大小都得油油嘴了……」</p>
<p>慶根癩痢的算盤打得沒錯，七月底祠堂裏要打利息，八月初頭要解會欵，全在這頭豬身上出產，全盤希望統在這黑暗的豬圈柵裏，平日甯可自己褲帶收緊點，豬食總是要餵的，賣了人糧買豬食——豆餅啦，糠麩啦，為什麽？想料債呵！慶根癩痢夫妻倆並沒有好吃懶做，卻被「債」壓扁了，直不起頭。欠阿虎爺爺的什麽「老債」，他自己也弄不清，據說還是他爸生前欠下的田租，不承認嗎？阿虎爺爺是地面上說說話的人，敢哼一個「不」字！所以，近來慶根癩痢對於窠裏的肥豬反增了一層憂鬱，夜裡連那麽笑的響夢也不做了。</p>
<p>可是，有些人仍為慶根癩痢欣悅地說：「癩痢今年好運氣，養得那樣一頭肥豬。」其實，這點話只會使他聽了出眼淚，不是嗎，阿虎爺爺當面亦對他說過了：要是十三不歸淸，十四一早要來秤豬的。再也不讓他七月半這天殺肉賣了。別說想豬頭油油嘴，就是豬鬃毛也不會剩一根的。慶根癩痢曾向他作揖下跪，完全沒用。這一夜慶根又做響夢了，打鋪上直　起來：</p>
<p>「什麽話，什麽話，窮人連一頭肥豬都不能有嗎？什麽話，豬是我半年心血養大的，吃掉我的糧食，……你把牠拖去，現現成成吃肉嗎？呵呵呵，你要了我的性命，你吃了我的肉……窮人只好永遠不翻身嗎？」這又使慶根癩痢的老婆嚕哩嚕蘇了；「你　苦命鬼，自己　病拖在身上，你　　　誰怕？」……</p>
<h3>在古城頭</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>在那靜靜地躺在南國底天野裏，呈着一種悒鬱，蒼老的樣子的古城裏，我曾經度過七個不同的秋天。生活的變動真是會出於你底意料之外的：那一年我唸書的一家中學校在一個迅雷一般的突變中被火焚燒了，等到事變安定以後，我已經再也用不到天天踏了那水門汀底路走向北門外去，等待下一個學期開始時再來繼續我底學業了。</p>
<p>為了維護縣城底安全，駐了足足一團兵。每一次走到外邊去，灰布衫的動物就不是地在我們底眼前出現。是初秋時季：南方底秋天的暮色是可眷戀的，我就常常在這樣的暮色蒼茫中走上了古城頭，獨自個兒坐着，坐着，漸漸地成了習慣。古城頭底暮色真是多麼溫靜的呢，天是深灰色的，太陽不知道什麽時候落下山去了。往北邊望去，那裏是一片成熟了的原野，麥穗在風中搖曳着，像一片海浪似的。秋風是帶着凉意了，看着那田陌間口踽踽行着的人，我底心裏默默地向他寄語珍重。原野上　落的有幾家人屋，遠的簡直只成了小小的方塊，冒出一股炊烟。在南邊，景象可完全不同了，櫛比的人家和商店，密密地堆成了一個古老的城市。不時還聽得見喧囂的市聲，呈現出日趨複雜的商業社會底內面。這樣的時候，近來會有一聲聲的軍營底集合號或是解散號，金屬的喇叭底號聲常常警惕我天已晚了，應該回家去吃晚飯了，而我却老是留連着，直到天完全黑了下來的時候……</p>
<p>離我底家沒有多遠，有一隊駐防的軍隊在那裏，我因為多去那裏走了幾趟，和一個連長相熟起來了。</p>
<p>這少年連長是溫和，秀氣，不像一般軍人那麽粗暴的腳色。他底彬彬有禮引起了我底注意。有一次，我把他邀了出來，一同上那古城頭去坐談，他很高興地答應了。　（未完）</p>

<h3>Bai Jianwu and Others Continue to Conspire, Ronin Imamura Recruits Several Thousand Followers, All Under the Command of Liu Guitang's Former Subordinates</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Li Bai sent a representative to the north to engage in secret activities in a concession in Tianjin.

Wu Jing, the section chief of the Customs Administration Department of the Customs, and Li Tonghua, the deputy director of the General Inspection Office for Preventing Smuggling by Road, visited Li in the afternoon to inquire about the truth of the foreign telegrams.

<p>(Nanjing) According to a report by the Japanese Domei News Agency, the Hebei and Chahar Political Affairs Commission has decided to establish inspection offices in Tianjin, and branch offices in Beiping, Baoding, Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, Cangzhou, Botou, Zhenqi Pass, and other places. A consumption tax of one-eighth of the Chinese customs duty will be levied on goods traded in eastern Hebei, and the goods will be allowed to be freely transported in Beiping and Tianjin, starting on September 1. Inquiries with responsible officials of the Ministry of Finance revealed that the Ministry has not yet received a reliable report, so the truth is unclear. If this is the case, it will undermine the uniformity of customs administration, which the government cannot tolerate. (One-day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Guangdong Province Financial Public Bonds Scheduled to be Issued on October 1st, Bond Amount 120 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After Finance Minister Kong announced the provisional measures for reorganizing Guangdong finances on the 21st of last month, it is now known that in the past ten days or so, the exchange rate between Guangdong silver certificates and legal tender has remained between 47 and 48 plus, and the exchange rate of silver certificates against foreign exchange has also been very stable. Commodity prices have also remained stable, indicating that a small number of speculators who wanted to manipulate the value of silver certificates for their own benefit have been suppressed by these provisional measures. The majority of Guangdong people have also expressed sincere support for these provisional measures. The Ministry of Finance believes that these provisional measures are only a transitional measure. In addition to actively investigating the account books of silver certificate issuance and counting the cash reserves of silver certificates, it is also scheduled to issue 120 million yuan of Guangdong financial public bonds on October 1, 1936, to replenish the silver certificate reserve public bond fund. It has been decided to allocate funds from the unified tax revenue of the central government in Guangdong. The interest rate is 4% and the bond term is 30 years.

<h3>The Pacific Crisis and Our Responsibility</h3>
<p>By Yi</p>
<p>At the Pacific Institute, representatives from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Russia made every effort to get the Japanese representatives to outline Japan's intentions in Asia during roundtable conferences and side discussions. It was indeed a bit embarrassing for the Japanese celebrities attending the academic conference to make a clear statement. It is, of course, impossible for the representatives of the great powers to get a satisfactory answer. In fact, everyone already understood this issue in their hearts. This is because the various acts of Japan's continental policy in recent years have been quite alarming and meaningful.</p>
<p>The military drama Japan is staging on the Asian continent has obviously caused a very tense situation in the Pacific. This situation is so tense that even Japan itself cannot help but feel considerable concern. Therefore, former Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshizawa said at the final meeting: "The Pacific problem has not been satisfactorily resolved. Relations between countries are becoming more and more strained every day. If we do not take timely precautions, serious consequences will occur." This is indeed the sentiment shared by all who care about peace in the Pacific. However, since the facts prove that the tension in relations between countries is caused by Japan's military development on the continent, then "the one who tied the bell must untie it." Preventing serious consequences also depends on Japan's own awareness.</p>
<p>However, judging from the current situation, the spirit of military-nationalist Japan to advance into the continent is unstoppable. And the East Asian stabilization forces championed by Japanese soldiers have full warlike qualities. How can we merely rely on Japan's own awareness to avoid the "serious consequences" that Yoshizawa mentioned? We Chinese have long been at the center of the Pacific crisis. Considering the vital interests of our entire nation, everyone has a great responsibility to save this crisis. This is what we deeply realize. If we want China to be saved, and if we want the Pacific to return to "peace," we must make our greatest efforts. There is only one goal for our efforts: to quickly abandon various less important prejudices, unite the strength of the entire country, and then unite all the forces related to peace in the Pacific to create a genuine, peaceful, stable force.</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Chengdu Incident: Four Japanese Met with Liu Xiang Yesterday to Inquire About the Cause and Circumstances of the Incident</h3>
<p>(Chengdu) Japanese Navy Lieutenant Commander Nakatsu Narishige, Army Lieutenant Commander Sawada Sakon, Consul stationed in Chongqing Kasuya Ren, and Third Secretary of the Embassy Matsumura Dojo, totaling four people, visited Chairman Liu at the Provincial Government at 2 p.m. on the 1st to express their respects. Secretary-General Deng of the Provincial Government, Special Commissioner Wu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Section Chief Shao, and others were present, with Shao acting as translator. After a brief exchange of pleasantries with Chairman Liu, Nakatsu and the others inquired in detail about the course of the Chengdu incident and the authorities' attitude. Chairman Liu stated that the occurrence of such an unfortunate incident amidst the ongoing Sino-Japanese diplomatic adjustments was deeply concerning to both sides. He hoped that this local incident would not affect the friendly relations between the two countries. He also expressed his desire to adopt appropriate measures to resolve the matter responsibly and promptly. He answered Nakatsu's questions with utmost sincerity, providing explanations one by one. The main points of the conversation are recorded as follows: (Question) Regarding the cause of the incident and the circumstances at the time... News from various domestic sources indicates that Communist Party members were inciting the unrest. When Chief of Staff He passed through Chongqing, he also... I wonder what your perspective is on this matter? Please enlighten me. (Answer) Regarding the cause of this incident and the circumstances at the time, a detailed report is currently being drafted and will be published in the future for your country's reference. However, during the outbreak of the riots, our military and police forces made every effort to rescue those involved, but were only able to rescue two Japanese nationals, while the other two unfortunately lost their lives. Various necessary measures have been taken afterward. Regardless, I, as Chairman, not only consider this extremely unfortunate but also deeply regret it. (Question) We hope that your detailed report can be published as soon as possible. (Answer) In order to expedite the resolution of this incident for both parties, we are willing to publish it as soon as possible. However, the circumstances at the time of the incident and other relevant facts have already been published and may be of reference to you. (Question) After the incident, we heard that your side executed two rioters who instigated the event. However, some people on our side still have some doubts about such a swift resolution. Would the Chairman please provide an explanation? (Answer) The reasons for adopting this measure are quite clear. Firstly, the instigators of the riots were interrogated and confirmed, and they should be brought to justice to uphold the law. After the outbreak of the riots, the situation was extremely chaotic. Although the military and police forces made every effort to suppress the unrest, it was imperative to swiftly execute the instigators in order to maintain social order and serve as a deterrent. Our independent adoption of this measure was an urgent, necessary, and effective method under the objective circumstances at the time. (Question) What is your opinion on the establishment of a Japanese consulate in Chengdu? (Answer) This is a diplomatic matter that should be resolved through consultations between the governments of both countries. Furthermore, the injured Japanese nationals, Tanaka and Seto, flew back to Shanghai and Hankou on the 1st, respectively. The ashes of Fukagawa and Watanabe were also taken to Shanghai by Japanese reporters on the 1st. (Central News Agency, 1st)</p>

<h3>How to Protect Beneficial Insects of Crops (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wu Fuzhen, Dean of the College of Agriculture, Zhejiang University</p>
<p>(1) What is a Beneficial Insect?</p>
<p>Beneficial insects and pests are two relative terms. In fact, insects themselves are neither inherently beneficial nor harmful. The beneficial insects and pests we talk about are defined by their relationship to humans. Insects that are beneficial to humans are called beneficial insects, and those that are harmful are called pests. For example, silkworms eat mulberry leaves, which is harmful to mulberry trees. However, silkworms spin cocoons that can provide us with raw materials for clothing, which is beneficial to humans. Therefore, we call silkworms beneficial insects. Wild silkworms also eat mulberry leaves and spin cocoons, but their cocoons are small and the silk is of poor quality. They cannot provide us with raw materials for clothing, and are not beneficial to humans. On the contrary, they consume the mulberry leaves we cultivate, so we call wild silkworms pests. In the future, if the cocoons spun by wild silkworms can be used by us in the same way as those of domestic silkworms, then instead of calling them pests, we will call them beneficial insects. Similarly, the blister beetle is harmful to crops such as beans and tomatoes as an adult, making it a pest. However, its larvae live in the soil and can feed on locust eggs, helping us to eliminate pests and making it a beneficial insect. Another example is the dermestid beetle in warehouses. Its larvae and adults sometimes eat other warehouse insects, and sometimes eat rice weevils. When it eats pests, it is a beneficial insect, but when it eats rice, it is a pest. Therefore, beneficial insects and pests are relative terms, and it completely depends on the extent of their benefit or harm to humans.</p>
<p>There are many insects that are beneficial to humans. Silkworms, bees, and others directly provide humans with raw materials for food and clothing, so we can all understand that they are beneficial insects. However, there are many insects that do not directly benefit humans, meaning they cannot provide us with raw materials for food and clothing, but they indirectly protect our raw materials for food and clothing. Therefore, we also call these insects beneficial insects. The beneficial insects of crops that we are going to talk about now refer to these insects that are indirectly beneficial to humans.</p>
<p>(2) Categories of Beneficial Insects of Crops</p>
<p>There are many kinds of beneficial insects of crops. Various bees and moths spread pollen, which is closely related to the reproduction of many crops. Many insects living underground improve soil structure by their activity in the soil, and increase soil productivity through the decomposition of their excrement and corpses, all of which are directly related to crop production. However, we are not talking about these types of insects now, but rather about various insects that can help humans eliminate pests that harm crops. For example, stem borers and aphids are crop pests, but there are many insects that can kill them, reducing the harm they inflict on crops. These many beneficial insects that help humans kill crop pests are beneficial to humans, so we should always try our best to protect them so that they can reproduce as much as possible and help us eliminate pests.</p>
<p>To talk about the protection methods for these many beneficial insects of crops, we should first understand how these beneficial insects kill pests. Generally speaking, there are two categories of methods by which beneficial insects kill pests: one is parasitic, which means that beneficial insects parasitize the body of pests, using the pests as food, causing the pests to die. Beneficial insects belonging to this category include various parasitic wasps and parasitic flies. The other is predatory, which means that beneficial insects directly search for and capture pests, using the pests as food. Beneficial insects belonging to this category include ladybugs and ground beetles. Parasitism can occur in pest eggs, pest larvae, pest pupae, or pest adults. Predation methods also vary. Some eat pest eggs, some eat pest larvae, and some eat pest adults, but eating pest pupae is relatively rare. The reason why many important pests we see in the fields cannot rampage as badly as we would expect is that these many beneficial insects attack them, preventing them from reproducing as much as possible.</p>
<p>(3) Methods for Protecting Beneficial Insects of Crops</p>
<p>Since beneficial insects attack pests in different ways, the methods of protection also vary depending on the type of beneficial insect. However, currently, apart from parasitic wasps which have special protection methods, the rest are only left to reproduce naturally. In any case, as long as we know that they are beneficial insects, and do not destroy them, we are protecting them. Now, the parasitic and predatory types will be described separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Parasitic Beneficial Insects</p>
<p>(甲) Egg-parasitic Beneficial Insects There are many egg-parasitic beneficial insects, but most of them are parasitic wasps, so now we will take the rice stem borer egg parasitic wasp as an example to illustrate: The body of the rice stem borer egg parasitic wasp is very small, with a body length of no more than two millimeters, so most farmers have not paid much attention to it. In fact, their numbers are also quite high. Their bodies are black, and they are about the same size as black flies (蚋) that suck the blood of humans and animals in the summer. After the rice stem borer moth lays its eggs on the rice leaves, it searches for the egg masses, lays its eggs inside, and after hatching, it feeds on the rice stem borer eggs. Therefore, the parasitized rice stem borer eggs cannot hatch into worms. After the parasitic wasp larvae grow up in the rice stem borer eggs, they pupate, and then the pupae turn into adults, fly out of the rice stem borer eggs, and lay eggs in other rice stem borer eggs that have not been parasitized. It grows in this cycle, with seven or eight generations each year. According to surveys, the percentage of rice stem borer eggs parasitized by this wasp is more than 40% in various regions. In other words, at least 40 out of 100 rice stem borer eggs are killed by being parasitized by this wasp. That is to say, the loss of our rice can be reduced by at least 40% because of this parasitic wasp. Therefore, protecting parasitic wasps is indeed a matter of utmost urgency.</p>
<p>How should we protect this parasitic wasp? The simplest method is to use two pots, one large and one small. The large one should be two feet in diameter and one and a half feet high, and the small one should be one foot in diameter and one foot high. Put half a pot of water in the large pot, and drip a little kerosene on the surface of the water. Then put the small pot into the large pot, and use stones to weigh down the bottom of the pot to prevent the small pot from floating in the large pot. The top of the large pot should be covered with a bamboo hat, suspended in the air, to prevent rainwater from falling in. This device is what we call the parasitic wasp protection pot. Once this protection pot is set up, we put the rice stem borer egg masses we have collected into the small pot. We know that some of the rice stem borer eggs we collect have been laid in by parasitic wasps, and some have not. It is not easy to distinguish with the naked eye. In any case, we don't have to distinguish. As long as they are egg masses, we collect them and put them in the pot. Rice stem borer eggs that have not been laid in by parasitic wasps will hatch, but because there is oily water around the small pot, they cannot escape and will starve to death. Even if they do escape, they will be contaminated with oil and die. Of course, rice stem borer eggs that have been laid in by parasitic wasps cannot hatch anymore, but the eggs laid by the parasitic wasps in the rice stem borer eggs will safely turn into larvae and feed on the rice stem borer eggs, growing and turning into adults. When they emerge as adults, they are unwilling to live in the old rice stem borer eggs again, and fly out of the pot to find other rice stem borer eggs that have not been parasitized to lay their eggs and reproduce their offspring. Therefore, this parasitic wasp protection pot, in addition to killing rice stem borers, is really a comfortable home for parasitic wasps. However, there are several points that need attention in the management of this type of protection pot:</p>
<p>1. The bamboo hat on the parasitic wasp protection pot should be larger than the large pot, and it cannot be broken, so as to prevent rainwater from falling in.</p>
<p>2. The protection pot should be placed near the rice fields, so that the parasitic wasps that emerge can fly into the fields to find egg masses.</p>
<p>3. When placing the egg masses, arrange the rice seedlings in a straight line in the small pot. There should be no weeds or branches or other objects around the egg masses that are close to the mouth of the large pot, otherwise there is a risk that the hatched larvae may escape from the pot.</p>
<p>4. After the rice stem borer eggs are placed in the protection pot, they should be checked from time to time to see if there are any hatched larvae falling into the water and not dying. If there are, add a few more drops of kerosene to kill them.</p>
<p>5. The rice stem borer eggs must be removed two weeks after being placed in the protection pot.</p>
<p>6. The more parasitic wasp protection pots that are set up, the better, and their locations should be evenly distributed. At least one pot should be set up for every 20 mu of field.</p>

<h3>Spanish Rebel Aircraft Bomb the Northern City of Irún; Plan to Combine Land and Sea Forces for Attack; Britain, the United States, France, and Other Nations Propose Mediation</h3>
<p>Hendaye: Spanish rebel forces have begun to escalate the deadlocked battle for the northeastern town of Irún. It is reported that they have dispatched five warships to launch a combined offensive from the sea, land, and air. They have also positioned a long-range cannon in a key area controlling the contested zone, with a range covering Irún and San Sebastián. The rebels are preparing a new offensive, causing great alarm among the residents of Irún. More than 6,000 refugees, mostly women and children, have already fled on foot into France. Yesterday, rebel bombers flew over Irún and dropped bombs, reportedly killing two women near the town hall. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Bayonne: Northern Spanish rebel forces warned officials and residents of Irún the day before yesterday that if they insisted on not surrendering, they would launch a simultaneous artillery barrage from the sea, land, and air, leveling the city. As of 7:00 AM today, five rebel aircraft carried out the warning, flying to the city and bombing it heavily. Several other rebel aircraft also bombed the port of Bijing Bavo, destroying many important buildings there. According to news from Madrid, the Ministry of the Interior has decided to reorganize the security forces and rename them the "National Revolutionary Corps" for the purpose of suppressing the rebel forces. According to a war report released by the Ministry of the Army regarding the western province of Extremadura, government forces have completely repelled the rebel forces in the province and are now preparing a counteroffensive. The three strategically important locations of Talavera, Visanto, and Medellín have been brought under government control. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Piliado: Six rebel aircraft dropped 25 incendiary bombs on this area today, causing fires to break out immediately in the city center. Shortly thereafter, an Italian Caproni-type engine aircraft flew in and dropped five bombs. The first bomb hit the headquarters of the Central Defense Committee, killing many people. The second bomb hit a monastery, and the third bomb hit a gasoline warehouse, killing more than 20 people. In view of the points targeted in this bombing, the defending forces believe it is a prelude to a new rebel offensive. The commander of the rebel forces in the north, Mola, has moved his headquarters to Vila in order to direct the offensive against the northern cities and towns more closely.

<p>Hendaye: The Argentine Ambassador to Spain, Mansilla, who previously initiated mediation in the Spanish Civil War, met today with the ambassadors of France, Britain, Belgium, and the United States stationed on the Spanish border, as well as the ministers of the Netherlands, Norway, and Czechoslovakia, and the chargés d'affaires of Finland and Sweden. They collectively nominated a leader of the diplomatic corps to send a telegram to the Spanish Republican government, proposing mediation. The telegram stated that if both the government forces and the rebel forces took appropriate measures, such as inviting military attachés from various countries stationed in Spain or the International Red Cross to mediate, then mediating the civil war would not be difficult. Ambassador Mansilla of Argentina believes that the prospects for this proposal are quite promising, and the Spanish government seems willing to give it serious consideration. As for the rebel forces, Mansilla is confident that they will also heed this advice. As for the prisoners of war held by both the government forces and the rebel forces, they have already exchanged lists. Rumor has it that rebel government member Mola is currently on the Basque coast and has met with key government figures to discuss possible ways for both sides to reach an agreement. The outcome of this meeting is unknown, but the front line in Guipúzcoa Province was quite quiet today. It is generally believed that this is related to the outcome of the meeting between key government and rebel figures. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Moroccan Indigenous People Dissatisfied with Rebel Forces; Troops Recalled for Defense and Suppression</h3>
<p>(Paris) A reporter from the Petit Parisien newspaper stationed in the Romanian capital recently stated that after the cabinet reshuffle in that country and the dismissal of Foreign Minister Titulescu, most of the diplomatic personnel have resigned en masse in solidarity with the foreign minister. Currently, the ministers to Poland, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Sweden, Latvia, Estonia, the United States, and Turkey have all successively resigned. This move has made things difficult for the new Foreign Minister Antonescu. It is rumored that Antonescu himself intends to resign because of this. As for Titulescu, he has recently been recuperating in southern France, and the National Peasant Party he leads has nominated a vice president to go to France to meet with him.

<h3>Foreign Observer Describes the Situation in Madrid; Residents Are Exceptionally Terrified</h3>
<p>Lisbon: This city has received a description from a foreign observer in Madrid regarding the terrifying situation in that city. It is claimed that the city is effectively without government and is controlled by a joint association of the National Confederation of Labor and the Iberian Anarchist Federation. They have established a "secret detective group" in the Bellas Artes Club, which holds court every night and carries out executions in the cellars. At the same time, Moroccan troops have advanced to a location less than 75 miles from the western capital. Residents of the city are exceptionally terrified, unsure what kind of tragedy will unfold after the rebel forces enter the city. In addition, members of the Anarchist Federation have made threats, saying that they would rather burn the city's prosperous areas to the ground and kill their wives and children than let them fall into the hands of the rebel forces. In the current civil war, the Spanish government's secret agents have considerable influence. The rebel headquarters in Burgos cannot make any major plans without them being known in detail in Madrid shortly thereafter, which greatly troubles the rebel forces. In addition, a "Revenge Secret Society" named "Automatic Suicide Squad" has been organized in the rebel militia on the Sicilian Anfia front. Each member has sworn to track down the leaders of the left wing to any part of the world after the war. If a member cannot fulfill his mission, he will accept the death penalty. It is rumored that President Azaña of the West is the first person on the list of those they want to kill. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Madrid: The Ministry of War and Navy announced at 3:30 PM today that government forces, after fierce fighting in Guadarrama, have repeatedly repelled rebel forces, killing 135 enemies and capturing 35, as well as seizing five machine guns and countless bullets. It is reported that the government forces on the southern front have made considerable progress and are gradually encircling the city of Granada. As for news from the Asturias region, it is shrouded in secrecy, but it is known that Torre de has a good chance of surrendering. Official communications agencies reported today that communist refugees who escaped from Cordoba said that rebel forces there had killed more than 3,000 workers and left-wing Republicans.

<h3>Rebel Leader Narrowly Escapes Assassination</h3>
<p>Lisbon: According to news received here from Spain, rebel leaders Franco and General Cabanillas narrowly escaped assassination. Rebel police have captured eight people, all of whom confessed that they were sent by the Communist Party headquarters to Burgos to assassinate the leaders of the Nationalist government. Police found pistols and poison on each of the suspects. After being tried by a military court, all eight were executed by firing squad. For safety, the bodyguard teams of the leaders have been increased. (National Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>Seville: A special dispatch from this agency states that the 900 rebel volunteers who participated in the battle to occupy the Tindoa mining area recently returned triumphantly amidst jubilant crowds, bringing back many spoils of war, including miners' hats placed on the ends of rifles to show their military prowess. One of the rebel volunteers who personally participated in the battle told this agency's reporter: "At dawn on August 26, our army began to advance towards the Tindo River mining area, using machine guns to sweep the area, followed by a cavalry attack, immediately occupying the main roads leading to the mining area. The remaining troops occupied nearby villages. This battle was commanded by the leader of the volunteer forces, Redondo. Our army marched straight into the center of the mining area without firing a shot. Most of the miners fled to the bottom of the shaft or the nearby forests. Cavalry are now searching everywhere. One security officer from the mining area surrendered." Currently, the normal state in the Tindoa area has probably been restored. The security forces are conducting a large-scale interrogation and executing miners. The authorities announced that 68 miners had been captured in the area, 67 of whom will be sentenced to death, but the date of execution has not yet been determined. Traffic from Huelva Province to the city of Seville has now been restored. Initial reports indicated that the resistance to the rebel forces in the Tindo River mining area was directed by the General Confederation of Labor and the Anarchist Federation, which planned to establish a free communist system in the area.

<h3>U.S. Government Notifies Nationals to Leave Madrid Tomorrow; 164 Still Remaining</h3>
<p>(Washington) The State Department announced today that the U.S. Embassy in Spain has individually notified the 164 U.S. nationals currently residing in Madrid to quickly leave the western capital on the passenger train departing on Wednesday for Alicante, where they will board the U.S. cruiser Quincy, as it may be the last U.S. ship to rescue nationals. The USS Oklahoma has now been ordered to return home, leaving only four U.S. ships in Spanish waters. Secretary of State Hull stated today that all U.S. warships may be recalled in their entirety within a few days. At the same time, the State Department is deeply concerned about the bombing of the USS Kane, as the Navy Department insists that the ship fired back in self-defense in accordance with the Navy Department's orders that any attack must be met with self-defense, so it does not violate the U.S. neutrality policy. It is reported that President Roosevelt or Secretary of State Hull will issue a formal statement within days, stating that the government will no longer be responsible for U.S. nationals who voluntarily remain in Spanish territory.

<h3>Romanian Political Turmoil Affects the Central European Situation; Most Diplomatic Personnel Resign Following Foreign Minister's Dismissal</h3>
<p>(Paris) A reporter from the Petit Parisien newspaper stationed in the Tangier International Neutral Zone recently sent a message stating that the indigenous people in Spanish Morocco have mostly expressed dissatisfaction with the rebel forces and have refused to enlist, which is quite serious. Rebel leader General Franco rushed back to the city of Tetouan in Morocco from the city of Seville on the 29th of last month and released Yarraktores, the leader of the Arab nationalist faction who was in prison, ordering him to continue to serve as the administrator of the Islamic temples in Morocco. Although the situation has eased slightly, there are still many difficulties ahead. Several Moroccan soldiers have recently been transferred from the southern route in Spain back to Africa to exert deterrence. The reporter also stated that three rebel generals were defeated by government forces in Granada and Cordoba last week. Southern Route Commander General Franco has dismissed these generals and replaced them with others. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Romanian Capital: After the Tatarescu cabinet implemented its reorganization on the 29th of last month, it held its first cabinet meeting at 10:00 AM this morning. The meeting resolved to disarm all military-type groups of various political parties. The meeting also decided that the Ministry of Education would draft a university reform plan in order to reaffirm discipline and rectify academic style, and it planned to stipulate that all those aged 18 to 21 should participate in mandatory labor service in order to carry out various public works projects. In addition, the Ministry of the Army submitted a bill to increase military spending, which was also accepted by the cabinet meeting. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) The Star newspaper of the Liberal Party in this city recently commented on the reorganization of the Romanian cabinet and the dismissal of Foreign Minister Titulescu, stating: "No one who hears of Titulescu's dismissal can fail to feel deep concern and anxiety. This incident clearly shows the giant hand of Germany asking questions. The root cause of this is to allow Germany to further dominate the Balkans. In recent years, Germany has spent countless sums on propaganda in Romania, with the intention of bringing Romania into its embrace. King Carol of Romania has always been known for sympathizing with reactionary forces. As expected, taking advantage of Titulescu's vacation in France, he resolutely reorganized the cabinet and excluded Titulescu from the door. As a result, Romania has joined the fascist group in Central Europe, adding another threat to European peace." (Havas News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(London) The Standard Evening News commented on the reorganization of the Romanian cabinet and the dismissal of Foreign Minister Titulescu, stating: "The establishment of the new Romanian cabinet is due to sympathy for fascism, fear of communism, and opposition to Jews. In recent weeks, the Russian government executed former Communist Party leaders Kamenev and Zinoviev, and the Russian political police have repeatedly launched large-scale operations. This may be a recent cause of Titulescu's dismissal, as the Romanian side is alarmed by these events. It is generally believed that the communist frenzy of the Soviet government will sweep through again for a time." (Havas News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Offensive Newspaper commented on the reorganization of the Romanian cabinet, stating that the new cabinet has no place for former Foreign Minister Titulescu, as Titulescu is a friend of the Bolshevik Party. Titulescu's dismissal is truly a blessing for Romania. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(London) Mussolini's boastful speech in Avellino yesterday has destroyed the hope of the signatories to the Locarno Treaty that a meeting would be held in mid-October to establish an agreement to consolidate European peace. Mussolini's speech will probably further increase Britain's determination to accelerate its rearmament. Since Mussolini said he could mobilize 8 million troops, it is natural that Britain will feel even more deeply the instability of its position in the Mediterranean. Furthermore, the "suspicious political combination" mentioned by Mussolini is considered here to be a direct reference to the mutual assistance pacts signed by France and Czechoslovakia with Soviet Russia, indicating that Italy's views on the European situation are now aligned with those of Germany. Leaders of the League of Nations in Geneva were also greatly distressed upon hearing Mussolini's speech. However, all parties also acknowledge that Mussolini's statement that the global arms race is unstoppable is not an exaggeration. As for Berlin, Mussolini's tone is quite welcome, as it can slightly divert other countries' attention from Germany's rearmament. (National Telegram, 31st)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Studies National Mobilization Plan; Comparison of European War and Russo-Japanese War; Consumption of Shells Increased Twentyfold</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Domei News Agency, September 1st) The Japanese Army plans to complete a new national defense enhancement plan of more than 3 billion yen over six years, starting from the Showa 12th fiscal year. However, only a complete national mobilization plan can be called perfect. If only the current two draft laws, the Military Industry Mobilization Law and the Resource Survey Law, are in place, it will be inferior to the great powers. Therefore, in order to complete the plan, the relevant authorities are conducting specific research and drafting legislation on preparations for national mobilization. The content of modern warfare is complex and diverse, and the consumption of material and human national defense resources is increasing exponentially. For example, during the Russo-Japanese War, the average daily war expenditure of the two countries combined was 5 million yuan, while the combined average daily war expenditure of the participating countries in the European War was approximately 250 million yuan. Furthermore, during the entire European War, the number of personnel mobilized, both inside and outside the battlefield, was 13.5 million in Germany, 8.2 million in France, 9.47 million in Britain, 5.65 million in Italy, 9 million in Austria, 3.8 million in the United States, and 18 million in Russia. Looking at the consumption rate of shells, the two countries of Japan and Russia consumed a total of 830,000 shells during the Battle of Mukden, while during the European War, France alone consumed 20 million shells in the Battle of Verdun, and the consumption reached 34 million shells in the Battle of the Somme. The Russo-Japanese War and the European War were only ten years apart, yet the consumption of shells alone increased more than twentyfold. The consumption of other national resources can be inferred in the same way. If another major war occurs, the numbers will be even greater. The Japanese Army, in order to maximize the full capacity of the people in wartime, aims to complete a national mobilization plan. Issues such as electricity, rural areas, trade promotion, and ideology are all being continuously advocated from this perspective. The main points of the national mobilization plan that the Army is attempting are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Spiritual Sector: Cultivate a unified national spirit, reject foreign evil thoughts, and establish the Japanese spirit.</p>
<p>(2) Personnel Sector: First, it is necessary to establish conscription and control agencies, such as the formulation of a national registration law, the recruitment of skilled technical personnel, and the establishment of a mandatory conscription system through the Industrial Mobilization Law, none of which can be delayed for a day. During the European War, Germany formulated the Fatherland Auxiliary Service Law, which stipulated that the government had the right to use men aged 17 to 60. Other examples that can be used as reference include France's National Mobilization Law, Britain's National Service Act, and the United States' Registration Act.</p>
<p>(3) Industrial Sector: Domestic industry in peacetime is mainly for the people's livelihood and is part of the control. In wartime, the first priority is to ensure sufficient military needs. Therefore, the foundation for wartime industrial mobilization should be established in peacetime in accordance with the international situation. Therefore, it is necessary to supplement insufficient resources, conserve resources, research substitutes, and establish a wartime military needs priority system for managing trade. Furthermore, it is necessary to establish an executive agency to convert peacetime industry into wartime industry.</p>
<p>(4) Factory Sector: Plan for the expansion and control of factories to increase production efficiency, and establish appropriate preparation agencies in peacetime to prepare peacetime factories to be transformed into military factories. It is also necessary to unify equipment and machinery and implement an education system to avoid unrestricted production in wartime and to manage and requisition factories.</p>
<p>(5) Financial Sector: During the World War, Germany's war expenditure averaged 34 billion marks per year, Britain's was 1.75 billion pounds, and the United States' was 13.1 billion US dollars. According to estimates by Japanese economic experts, future war expenditure will require 20 billion yuan per year. Therefore, in order to raise this huge war expenditure, it is necessary to establish special financial institutions in peacetime and research countermeasures in advance.</p>
<p>(6) Other: Appropriate measures must be taken in peacetime regarding the promotion of invention and creation and the establishment of control agencies for transportation and communications.</p>
<h3>Japan's Southern Advance Policy; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Establishes South Seas Division</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The government's Taiwan and South Seas Colonization Companies Law has been passed by the Diet. Japan's economic southern advance policy is taking its first step. In order to coordinate the various southern advance policies diplomatically, Foreign Minister Arita has decided to amend part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' official system and establish a third division within the European and Asian Bureau to manage South Seas affairs. This plan will be formally decided by the Privy Council on September 9. It has already been internally decided to appoint Yoshita Tan'ichiro as the first chief of the South Seas Division. The mission of the South Seas Division is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) To manage diplomatic affairs related to the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, the Dutch East Indies, Vietnam, and the islands belonging to Britain, France, the United States, Spain, and Portugal.</p>
<p>(2) To investigate immigration projects, promote trade, and agricultural and forestry investment in the South Seas.</p>
<p>(3) To promote friendly relations between Japan and the Philippines, resolve the Davao land issue, and smoothly promote trade between Japan and the South Seas countries. (Dispatch from Domei News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The newly appointed Minister to Siam, Ishizawa Itaro, is scheduled to leave Tokyo in early September to take office. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a meeting within the ministry on the afternoon of the 31st, attended by Director-General Kuwajima of the East Asian Bureau, Chief of the First Division Kamimura, and representatives from the Ministries of the Army, Navy, Finance, and Colonial Affairs. They exchanged opinions on specific matters concerning cooperation between Japan and Siam, and the results reached the following conclusions:</p>
<p>(1) South Seas countries mistakenly believe that Japan's southern advance policy is a military invasion and harbor doubts about Japan's legitimate economic policies. Siam in particular is in a difficult position because British and French forces are intervening. Japan should strive to make Siam understand Japan's legitimate actions.</p>
<p>(2) Economic cooperation should be carried out gradually to avoid Siam misunderstanding that Japan has an economic invasion policy, and this work should be combined with the interests of the Siamese people. (Dispatch from Domei News Agency, 1st)</p>
<h3>After the Party Prison Incident, Anxiety Spreads Throughout Soviet Russia; Countless People Arrested</h3>
<p>(Paris) Le Matin recently received news from Moscow stating that Soviet Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars Molotov has been dismissed from his position. Anxiety is currently felt throughout the country, and countless people have been arrested. Even in the distant Turkmen and Uzbek republics, many people have been arrested. It is also reported that anti-government activities have been discovered within the Crimean Republic, and the chairman of the republic's government, Ibragimov, has been executed. In addition, an anti-government conspiracy has been uncovered in Georgia, the hometown of Communist Party General Secretary Stalin. A total of 40 people were involved, including Stalin's relative, Jugashvili, who have all been arrested. Foreign Affairs Commissar Litvinov, fearing that the arrest of so many important figures would create a bad impression abroad, advised Stalin. It is reported that Stalin agreed with his words, and therefore, although Prosecutor General Vyshinsky filed a public prosecution against Izvestia editor-in-chief Bukharin and many other individuals, the government has decided not to pursue the matter. Furthermore, the famous journalist Radek, who was originally implicated, will also be released soon. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Trotsky Imprisoned</h3>
<p>Regarding the continued residence of Soviet Communist Party and cadre faction leader Trotsky in Norway, the Minister of Justice, Li Ai, of the Norwegian capital, issued the following public announcement: "By order of the State Council, Trotsky and his wife shall henceforth live in isolation and shall be specially protected by police. Regarding Mr. Trotsky's movements and interactions with the outside world, various rules have been passed. Hereafter, except with the temporary permission of the Government Passport Bureau, Mr. Trotsky shall not be allowed to receive external visitors. Mr. Trotsky shall not have the right to use a telephone, and his outgoing and incoming telegrams must be inspected." As for where Trotsky will be imprisoned in the future, it has not been announced. Currently, he remains in his original residence in Hønefoss, with the police monitoring his movements. Tomorrow, Mr. Trotsky will meet with the renowned Norwegian lawyer Bendel Volte, who will assist Mr. Trotsky in accordance with the procedures stipulated in Norwegian law regarding public law matters.

<h3>Anatomy of the Palestine Upheaval (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Intolerable</p>
<p>The upheaval in Palestine, though exceedingly tragic, is not a novel occurrence. Over the past several years, there have been multiple instances in which chronic unrest has erupted into riots and massacres in Palestine. Although past upheavals have been quelled by British forces, the seeds of unrest have always remained, and they can ignite new upheavals at any time. These roots have been present for a long time, and their nature is very complex. Although Palestine is small in area and not particularly fertile, it is the center of storms, where various conflicting faiths, national ideologies, and imperialism clash in a complex struggle, creating waves that affect the entire world.</p>
<p>The religious dimension of this issue is quite prominent and long-standing. For Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, Palestine can be said to be a shared holy land. Unfortunately, the historical struggles among these three major religions for territorial jurisdiction have not yet been forgotten by the world. Ancient tragedies, such as the Crusades, the Roman destruction of the Temple, and even Joshua's conquest, still move people's hearts and incite their desires. However, it would be a mistake to explain the current situation in Palestine solely from a religious perspective. Those traditional factors have been overshadowed and altered by more numerous recent forces—such as nationalistic ideologies and economic developments. Before correctly assessing the current situation in the Palestine upheaval, we must understand the interplay of these old and new factors.</p>
<p>The most conspicuous aspect of the current crisis in Palestine is, of course, the bitter struggle between Jews and Arabs. But this animosity is a recent development. Before the Great War, it simply did not exist. Until 1914, Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire, sharing the rule of the Turkish Sultan with many other ethnic groups. It cannot be denied that the Turks and Arabs, though both Muslim, were not harmonious. Nor can it be denied that the Arabs in Palestine and other Turkish territories began to absorb Western nationalistic ideologies at a certain point and dreamed of breaking away from Turkish rule. But at that time, Arab nationalism was still very young, and the enemy they focused on was only the Turks. At that time, Jews were not a significant factor because there were far fewer Jews residing in Palestine than Arabs. The indoctrination of the ideology known as "Zionism" had not yet begun. And, what is more important, Jewish nationalism at that time was merely a pious inspiration; there was no practical action to realize the ideal.</p>
<p>The rise of modern Zionism is only about fifty years old. Its origin was not in Palestine but in Europe, and it was promoted by Western Jews, led by Dr. Theodor Herzl. Modern Zionism is a political transformation of the previous purely religious idea. As for Jewish nationalism in the purely religious sense, it has existed since the Roman destruction of the Temple and the massacre of Jewish residents of Palestine. Naturally, the dispersed Jews continued to yearn for their lost homeland; in the centuries that followed, Jews from all over the world traveled to their homeland at any time to visit the holy sites and mourn the ruins. Moreover, small groups composed of a few pious Jews often resided in Palestine. The members of these small groups were mostly elderly people who accepted donations from abroad to spend their remaining years in long prayers and meditations. They awaited the realization of the "Restoration of Zion," because this was a hope latent in the heart of every Jew.</p>
<p>However, none of these Jews who returned to their homeland were Zionists in the modern sense, because the "Restoration of Zion" they expected was to arise miraculously and suddenly from the will of Jehovah. Only God himself knows when this sacred event will occur. In fact, those extremely orthodox members who lived in Palestine for a long time looked down on the modern Zionist movement. In the minds of those zealots, any attempt to realize the restoration of Israel by human power, especially attempts by Jews who did not fully observe traditional religious laws, would not only fail to move Jehovah but would also anger him, thus delaying the realization of the awaited miracle.</p>
<p>So, what exactly is "modern Zionism"? Its basic goal is to build a "national home" in Palestine, where at least a large Jewish population resides, where the Jewish nation can freely develop its unique identity, and where the Jews scattered around the world can enjoy greater honor and value, even if they do not live in Palestine or have never even been to their ancestral homeland.</p>
<p>Such a plan began before the Great War. In the thirty years before the Great War, Jewish nationalistic colonial groups destined for Palestine gradually developed, funded by donations from all Jews. These early Jewish nationalistic movements did not arouse concern among Turkish officials and the Arabs living in Palestine. Jewish nationalism at that time had no diplomatic backing, and the agricultural immigrants were mostly unselected, so they were unaccustomed to work and still had to hire Arab workers. In short, before 1914, Jewish nationalism was a neglected factor.</p>
<p>But this situation changed abruptly because of the World War. When Turkey allied with the Central Powers at the beginning of the war, the Entente decided on the end of the Ottoman Empire. This naturally gave rise to various hopes and dreams. In terms of Zionism, this situation was particularly evident; the result was this: at the height of the war, the British government won the support of Zionism through the famous Balfour Declaration. The text of this declaration said: "His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object..."</p>

<h3>League of Nations Covenant Amendment Issue Proposals from Four Nordic Countries, New Zealand also Has Suggestions</h3>
<p>Geneva: The League of Nations Extraordinary Assembly passed a resolution in July this year, requesting member states to propose plans for strengthening the effectiveness of the League of Nations Covenant so that the League of Nations General Assembly could submit them for discussion at its September meeting. The Swedish government recently submitted its proposal to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol. The content of the proposal advocates that the cooperative relationship between the League of Nations Executive Council and member states should be made as close as possible. In the future, when international disputes occur, the League of Nations should deal with them as early as possible before the situation deteriorates. All the provisions contained in the Covenant should be fully implemented, not limited to a few provisions. For example, the various provisions on limiting armaments should be implemented one by one. However, regarding the conclusion of regional conventions to supplement the collective security system with military mutual assistance obligations, the Swedish government is not willing to accept other constraints besides the existing obligations contained in the League of Nations Covenant. Norwegian Foreign Minister Gutte also submitted a proposal to the League of Nations Secretary-General, the content of which explains that the four Nordic countries have already created two main principles regarding the issue of preventing war: 1. Reducing armaments; 2. Implementing the prevention measures contained in Articles 11, 15, 17, and 19 of the Covenant in a systematic manner. Among them, the first principle is a necessary condition for the implementation of sanctions. If the aggressor country has powerful armaments, the League of Nations will not be able to impose sanctions. As for the implementation methods of reducing armaments, the most prominent is the draft resolution proposed by the Soviet Union to the Presidium of the Disarmament Conference on June 4, 1934. This draft proposes to rename the Disarmament Conference as the "Permanent Conference for the Protection of Peace" and to define it as a permanent institution with four tasks: (A) to continue the work of the Disarmament Conference in order to conclude a disarmament convention; (B) to conclude agreements to establish a new system for guaranteeing security; (C) to take appropriate measures to prevent armed conflicts; and (D) to consult with each other in the event of violations of current treaties in order to maintain peace. In addition, Norway also put forward the following requirements: 1. Monitoring the arms trade; 2. Amending the "unanimity" rule; 3. Convening international conferences to discuss the two issues of stabilizing currencies and supplying colonial raw materials. The latter is the direct cause of wars; 4. The signatory countries of various regional conventions should all promise that any actions against the aggressor country must first obtain the permission of the League of Nations Executive Council. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Geneva: The New Zealand government's proposal on consolidating the League of Nations Covenant, which was received here today, advocates the creation of an international army dedicated to upholding the League of Nations Covenant, or the allocation of a portion of the armed forces of member states to the League of Nations. Although today is the deadline for proposals to amend the Covenant, only five countries have responded. Among them, New Zealand's suggestion is the most complete. In addition to the above-mentioned advocacy, it further proposes that in the event of sanctions, all League of Nations member states should hold a national referendum to decide whether they are prepared to automatically join immediately and whether they should automatically allocate a portion of their quota of troops to the League of Nations for dispatch.

<h3>After Violent Flooding in Shaanxi, the Yellow River in Hebei Province is in Dire Straits; Newly Built Dams in Donglou Were Washed Away; Critical Breaches Discovered in the Northern Fourth Section; Six Thousand Civilians from Changyuan and Puyang Worked Through the Night on Emergency Repairs; The Third Peak Flood Crest is Approaching Hebei</h3>
<p>Baoding Dispatch: Due to recent heavy flooding in the upper reaches of the Yellow River in Shaanxi Province, the turbulent waters rushed downstream. When the flood crest passed through Hebei, the current was extremely swift and the water level rose sharply, matching last year's highest water level. This led to urgent reports from all sections. The Provincial Government and the Department of Construction specifically telegraphed instructions to all engineering personnel of the Yellow River Affairs Bureau and the magistrates of the three counties along the river, Changyuan, Puyang, and Dongming, to personally lead civilians to guard the dikes. From the time the flood crest passed through Hebei Province on August 21st until the 30th, everyone remained in a state of extreme tension. The water level rose daily, and dangerous situations occurred continuously. The magistrates of Changyuan, Puyang, and Dongming personally led six thousand civilians to assist all the river workers in a desperate effort to protect the dikes. Fortunately, no major disasters occurred, which is a blessing for our province and the downstream provinces. The details of this flood and the emergency repair work on various sections of the river in our province are described below:</p>
<p>Donglou Dangerous Section - Rescue From Danger</p>
<p>After the Shaanxi floodwaters flowed downstream, our province immediately received a telegram from the upper reaches, and precautions were immediately increased. After the flood crest arrived in Hebei, its force was unusually strong. On the 22nd, the water level first rose sharply by nine and four-tenths of a centimeter, and a breach was discovered in the Nanquantou embankment, posing a very high risk. Despite desperate rescue efforts, the water level continued to rise sharply, reaching over one meter and three inches by about 4 p.m., and continuing to rise. On the south side of the northern fourth section, the Xiaodi embankment was over a meter above the dam. The Donglou area, facing the brunt of the current, put great strain on the newly built dams. Subsequently, the main current approached the dike, and the earth foundation of each dam was completely washed away. The various dams and weirs in Nansi Lengzhai and Liuzhuang were continuously shifted by the excessive water flow. By 8 p.m., a portion of the bank protection had been submerged. Sandbags and hemp sacks were piled up to protect the area. In the northern second section, the Zhaizhuang current merged with the Chuangu ditch, and the main current approached the dike, posing a significant threat. Orders were issued to quickly hang willow branches to slow the current. By 4 a.m. on the 23rd, the water gradually receded, and by about 10 a.m., the water level stabilized slightly. However, the newly built dams in the Donglou area remained submerged in the water, becoming a special engineering concern. On the 24th and 25th, the water level gradually receded. On the 26th, the water level at the Old Dam fell to 5860 (the highest water level was 6394), a drop of about five feet from the highest water level. After this surge, the 23rd through 28th weirs of the Old Dam were all submerged. At Nansi Liuzhuang, due to the current surging onto the dike, the 13th weir of the eastern dam and the 5th to 17th weirs behind the Guanting were all submerged. Emergency work was done to repair the areas. However, Nanxiaodi in the northern fourth section and Donglou, etc., were impacted by the diversion of the water by dikes in Shandong, causing continuous slumping. The engineering situation was serious and extremely dangerous. From the 27th to the 29th, the situation remained dangerous. The magistrates of Changyuan, Puyang, and Dongming assisted the engineering personnel of the River Affairs Bureau by stacking bags and hanging willow branches to desperately block the breaches. Six willow dams were added at Donglou to save the dangerous section. All the more than six thousand civilians from the surrounding counties guarded the dike through the night, carrying earth from the riverbank to raise the dike and inspect for leaks. Donglou was not out of danger until the 30th, and the engineering situation in each section also improved.</p>
<p>Raising the Taihang Dike - Project Completed</p>
<p>The Taihang Dike on the north bank of the Yellow River was intended to make up for the lack of connection between the Yellow River dikes in Hebei and Henan provinces and to defend against floods on the slow-moving flats. It was traditionally repaired and maintained by the villagers concerned. However, due to insufficient manpower, it had become dilapidated. The Department of Construction requested and was approved by the National Economic Commission to allocate 20,000 yuan through the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission for Changyuan County to repair and raise it. The project has now been completed, widening the top of the dike by three meters and raising the height to seven meters. The bank protection project is also underway, planting willow trees along the dike. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission will then take over the project. With the completion of this project, floods from the upper reaches will not overflow the flats. The Provincial Government and the Department of Construction recognized that all the river workers of the River Affairs Bureau fought bravely to control the dangers and deserved commendation. They specifically ordered the director of the River Affairs Bureau to compile a register and report it for the purpose of awarding bonuses. The Provincial Government also issued a commendation to the magistrates of Changyuan, Puyang, and Dongming counties to encourage them. However, recently, snow melting in the upper reaches of the Yellow River mixed into the river, causing the water level to rise sharply again and will continue to flow downstream into the sea. The third surge is about to arrive. The province has received a telegram from the upper reaches stating that the flood crest will arrive in Hebei within days. The Provincial Government has strictly ordered the Director of the River Affairs Bureau, She Yuliu, and the magistrates of Changyuan, Puyang, and Dongming to pay close attention and guard the dikes at all times. It is anticipated that if this third surge can safely pass through the province, then the Yellow River in our province can celebrate peace this year. (31st)</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang Arrived in Hangzhou Yesterday Morning - Toured West Lake Scenery in Hangzhou and Returned to Beijing - Party and Government Organs Welcomed Him and He Gave a Speech</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Feng Yuxiang, member of the Central Committee and Deputy Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, stayed in Guling for a month to avoid the summer heat. Now that autumn is cool, he left Lushan on August 30 for Nanchang. At 9:11 a.m. on the 31st, accompanied by his secretary Dong Zhicheng, Ye Rong, Senator Yu Weiqian, Adjutant Sun Jixian, and ten guards, he arrived in Hangzhou on a specially prepared train of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The Jiangxi Provincial Government specially dispatched Li Dezhao of the Provincial Committee and Peng Lingxiao, Director of the Public Security Bureau, to escort the train. Feng originally intended to visit Guifeng and Longhushan in Yiyang, but temporarily abandoned the idea due to some reason. He arrived in Jiangshan at 8 p.m. Zhang Fakui went to the station to welcome him. Feng got off the train for a short rest and discussed military affairs of suppressing bandits and gave instructions on defense with Zhang. After receiving a telegram from the Jiangxi Provincial Government last night informing of Feng's whereabouts, the Provincial Government specially sent a district administrative commissioner from Qu County to lead troops to Jiangshan to board the train and escort him. At 8:30 p.m., the train continued to drive down, and he got off the train for a short tour when he arrived in Zhuji. He arrived at the Jiangbian station at 8 a.m. Those who crossed the river to meet him included Luo Xiatian, Fang Qingru, Jin Yueguang, Jiang Qingyun, Wu Wangji and other members of the Provincial Party Department; Xu Qingfu, Acting Chairman of the Provincial Government; Huang Huabiao, Secretary-General; Cheng Yuanfan, Director of the Finance Department; Xu Shaodi, Director of the Education Department; Wu Tingyang, Director of the Construction Department; Zhou Xiangxian, Mayor of Hangzhou; Zheng Wenli, President of the High Court; Zhou Zonghua, Salt Transport Envoy; and Du Zhenyuan and Wu Jingqing, Director and Deputy Director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and more than one hundred others. Feng, wearing a gray Zhongshan suit and a yellow Panama hat, was full of energy. After getting off the car, he shook hands with the welcoming staff one by one to express his gratitude. He immediately boarded a specially prepared ferry to cross the river and changed to a car to go directly to Zhongxing Villa on Shengtang Road for a rest. After entering, the party and government leaders visited one after another, exchanged greetings briefly, and then left. Feng then took a car to the Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government to pay his respects. At noon, Mayor Zhou hosted a simple meal at Zhongxing Villa. At 6 p.m., the Provincial Party Department, Provincial Government and other agencies jointly held a banquet. The reporter met Feng on the wheel. According to his conversation, he said that our Republic of China still has great rivers and mountains from our ancestors. Let's see how future generations can strive for the nation and preserve it. The recent invasion of North China by the puppet army Li Shouxin was repelled by Chairman Fu (Zuoyi), but the situation is indeed very dangerous. The Guangxi peace issue is currently being negotiated through messengers back and forth, and it can be realized at any time. Zhejiang is a prosperous area. I have observed along the way that the situation is quite good, and this year's autumn harvest is abundant, which is very different from the Northwest and North China. Although the equipment of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road is simpler than other roads, it is clean and tidy, and the province saves money and energy, which is better than other roads. After Feng Yuxiang arrived in Hangzhou, Xu Qingfu, the acting chairman, visited him at ten o'clock, talked for twenty minutes and then left. Feng was then accompanied by Zhou Xiangxian to visit the tombs of national heroes such as Yue Fei, Qiu Jin, and Zhang Cangshui in West Lake, and paid his respects. He then took a car with his entourage to Bapu to watch the Qiantang River tide. He brought a large number of steamed buns with him to serve as lunch and distributed them to all his companions. After an hour, he returned to Haining and Sun Jidan, the county magistrate, went to meet him at the county government, inspected and visited Jinbai and Bingdilian. He returned to Hangzhou at two o'clock, toured the scenic spots of West Lake, and was jointly hosted by the Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government for a banquet in the evening. He will attend the Provincial Government's transfer meeting on the morning of the 2nd and then set off to return to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Chahar Province - Banning Horses from Leaving the Country Affects Agriculture in North China</h3>
<p>Zhangjiakou Correspondence: The bandits who are currently entrenched in northern Chahar, attempting to disrupt Suiyuan, such as De Wang, Wang Ying, and Li Shouxin, are actively expanding their military forces. They have been recruiting cavalry and collecting horses to the fullest extent. Recently, they have also issued a false decree prohibiting horses from leaving the country, in order to fully expand their cavalry. Horses in northern Chahar are born in natural pastures and are good at running, so they are an important tool for military purposes. However, when moved inland and trained, they often become the main tool for agricultural work. In the past, many people from North China came to Chahar to buy horses. Recently, due to the even rainfall and promising autumn harvest in North China, such as Shandong and Hebei provinces, many livestock merchants have gathered in Zhangjiakou. They are all worried about being in a dilemma due to the false decree prohibiting horses from leaving Chahar. According to these merchants, if the livestock in this area cannot be sold to the interior, the price of livestock in various places will inevitably rise sharply during the autumn harvest. This shows that the ban on horses leaving Chahar will inevitably affect agriculture in North China. (28th)</p>
<h3>Nanhui - Head Constable Beats Drug Addict to Death</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaodi, a smoker from Beicheng Township, District 8 of Nanhui County, was found to be smoking morphine by Chen Hanzhang, patrol leader of the Nicheng Public Security Sub-station. On the night before, Chen led police officers to arrest Wang Xiaodi. After taking him to the station, for some unknown reason, they beat him severely. Xiaodi had an older brother named Xuekui, who went to inquire. The station initially refused, and then falsely claimed that he had been escorted to the county government. When Xuekui rushed to the County Public Security Bureau to inquire, each agency said that there was no such case. So Xuekui rushed back to the Nicheng sub-station, which replied that Xiaodi had committed suicide for fear of punishment and died in the bean field there. Later, his brother went to investigate the body and found that there was a hole in the head of the deceased, and blood was dripping. Knowing that there was something else going on, he requested the county government to examine it. The county government then sent Xue Chengzai to examine it and found that the deceased Wang Xiaodi had more than ten whip marks on his back and a hole in his head from being hit by a gun butt. It was clear that he had been beaten to death and his body was abandoned in the field. After the examination was completed, Xue Chengshen interrogated the police officers in the station one by one. Qiao Jinshan and Jin Guisheng were found to have hesitated in their statements. Xue Chengshen took them to the county government for questioning. As for patrol leader Chen Hanzhang, he had already fled. At present, the family of the deceased believes that Xiaodi's death was bizarre and especially tragic, so they intend to request the county government to investigate and redress the injustice for the deceased.</p>
<h3>Suzhou - Adjusting Disputes Between Landlords and Tenants</h3>
<p>The land rent disputes in Wu County have been brewing for several months, but no solution has been found. Magistrate Deng, seeing that the autumn harvest is approaching and the various industry associations are preparing to collect rent, in order to adjust the disputes between landlords and tenants, in addition to publicly soliciting opinions for reference, also carried out industry association registration, which has already begun. If they do not register, the official will not assist in collecting rent in the future. At the same time, a plan for adjusting the disputes between landlords and tenants was drafted and submitted to the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments for approval. However, the various industry associations here believe that this plan is in conflict with the law, and Sheng Zhenbiao and others have telegraphed the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments for revision. Magistrate Deng also convened a meeting of all relevant parties yesterday (the 1st) at 9 a.m. to discuss everything. More than ten people, including Shen Yizhi, signed in. The method of adjusting the disputes between landlords and tenants was presented for discussion for a long time, and the meeting adjourned at noon. In the afternoon, the landlords discussed everything at the Field Industry Exchange, but there was still no concrete solution. As for the Land Rent Disposal Office, the county government decided to fundamentally reorganize it.</p>
<h3>President of the District Court Sworn In</h3>
<p>Qian Sen, President of the Wu County District Court, took office in the upper ten days of the previous month. Yesterday (the 1st) morning, the swearing-in ceremony was held, with Zhu Shusheng, President of the Jiangsu Higher Court, presiding over the oath. Representatives from various agencies participated.</p>
<h3>Wuxi - Nine-Province Telephone Call Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has been laying long-distance telephone lines in nine provinces for more than a year, and it has now been completed in order. However, there are still sporadic projects on the Beijing-Hankou line, which will not be completed until next month. In the past two days, the Beijing-Tianjin-Shanghai-Hankou and Beijing-Wuhu-Ganzhou-Zhejiang lines have been tested one after another, and the sound is extremely loud, the voice is clear, and the results are excellent. The Chief Engineer is deeply concerned that the lines are too long and will damage the transmission power, so he has set up more than one hundred amplifiers, which are located in the main bureaus, such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Hankou, Suzhou, Xuzhou, Jinan, Qingdao, etc. All have been installed. Now that the test results are good, it has been fully opened for calls yesterday (September 1), connecting Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Shandong, Henan, and Hebei provinces, and branch money in this province can also be connected to the phone. There are hundreds of places in total. As for the technical aspects, each bureau is responsible for each section. The toll is three yuan for three minutes each time.</p>
<h3>Tax on Surrogate Pawnshops Reduced by Half</h3>
<p>In each county in Jiangsu Province, surrogate pawnshops should pay a tax of 75 yuan in silver each year, the same as pawnshops. In the past, the provincial government temporarily levied half the tax on newly opened pawnshops in order to encourage pawnshops and to show sympathy for pawnshop owners. As for surrogate pawnshops, their business is inferior to that of pawnshops. If they are all charged 75 yuan, it is inevitable that the burden is uneven. It is now decided that starting this year, all business license fees for surrogate pawnshops in this province will be reduced by half to 37 yuan and 50 cents each year, in order to show sympathy and reduce the burden. An order was issued to all counties yesterday to inform all surrogate pawnshops to be aware.</p>
<h3>Changzhou - National Election Nominates Candidates</h3>
<p>The election of regional representatives to the Wu County National Assembly began at 9 a.m. today (the 31st) and was held separately in the district offices, with elections before 12 p.m. The supervisors sent by the county government to each district set off early to arrive and supervise. On September 1, the district office will send the ballots to the county. On the 2nd, the county government will send the ballot boxes to the Wuxi Second District Election Office to open them. Yesterday, Cui Dehua, the section chief specially sent by the Second District Commissioner's Office, came to Changzhou as the election instructor and inquired about the national election situation in detail from County Magistrate Hou, and then returned to Wuxi to report.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin - Two Women Commit Suicide Due to Quarrels</h3>
<p>Yang Mingxuan, captain of the smuggling suppression team in Lupugang, Xixiang, was dissatisfied with his concubine Zhou Shashi in January this year. The cook Chen Zuobin accompanied Zhou Shashi to Hongyun Bridge on Chenglu Road outside Xixi Town and stabbed her to death with a knife. Yang fled without a trace, and Chen was detained and interrogated in the county until July without a sentence. The day before yesterday, Chen's wife was at home and committed suicide by taking poison due to financial difficulties due to life difficulties. Chen's wife also hanged herself, but fortunately she was rescued and reborn.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou - Huaiyin Ship Lock Opens</h3>
<p>The ship locks built this time on the canal include Shaobo, Gaoyou, Huaiyin, Liulaojian, and Suqian, a total of five places. The magnitude of the project and the solidity of the structure are rare in history. Now the Huaiyin Ship Lock has passed water and opens four times a day to allow ships to go up and down. Each ship is tentatively required to pay a gate fee of 2 yuan and 50 cents for the largest and 1 cent and 50 cents for the smallest. Since the opening, the average daily gate fee is more than 180 yuan. Once all the above gates release water consistently, the gate fee will still have to be increased. It is said that even if it is increased to more than three times, the cost of ships passing through the old gates in the past is still reduced. In the past, there were many water gates along the canal, and it took a long time to open the gates, so the cost was very high. However, since the completion of the new gate, the old Huawan, Tongji, Fuxing and Qingjiang four gates above Huaiyin will be demolished in phases. However, there are many people who rely on the opening and closing of the original gate to make a living. Since the completion of the Huaiyin gate, the workers of the abandoned gates know that their lives are not guaranteed, so they made six requirements in common: (1) The original workers must be placed in the new gate, (2) Compensation for past losses of 2,000 yuan, the other four items are nothing more than maintaining the livelihood of the existing personnel, but the first item is fundamentally untenable, because the new gate is completely mechanical, uses very few people, and cannot pass. As for the second item, the official has already subsidized 500 yuan at one time, and no further coercion shall be used. However, the old gate employees have not yet accepted it and are still in stalemate. As for the original 700 yuan per month for the four gates, the regular fee has long been ordered to be cancelled.</p>
<h3>All Circles Commemorate Zhang Jian</h3>
<p>September 2 is the 10th anniversary of the death of Mr. Zhang Jian. Local agencies, groups, and educational, industrial, and charitable circles will gather at the Zhang family cemetery in Luhongzha at 9 a.m. on the 2nd to pay tribute, and a public ancestral hall will be established in his hometown, Changle Town.</p>
<h3>Jiashan - Woman Murders for Money</h3>
<p>There is a Shen Juntai clothing shop in Dongshi, Tianning Town, whose owner is Shen Songnian, who moved here from Youdonggang. His wife, Chen, is over twenty years old. She once bought a sewing machine from the Shengjia Sewing Company in Suzhou for a price of 150 yuan, and agreed to pay back 5 yuan per month. By July, she had paid 50 yuan. On the 29th, Zhang Bingsheng, a staff member of the company, over thirty years old, came to Ning from Luxu to collect accounts. It was late, and Chen invited him to drink and insisted on staying overnight. Zhang found it difficult to refuse her kindness, and since there was no comfortable hotel in the small town, he settled down. Chen saw that Zhang Bingsheng had collected more than 100 yuan, and a bad idea arose. She secretly prepared a hemp bag and, in the middle of the night, held a kitchen knife and slashed Zhang wildly in the dark. Suddenly, blood splattered everywhere. Zhang woke up from his sleep, screamed in pain, and the neighbors gathered around. Those who saw it were all horrified. Zhang Bingsheng was stabbed eleven times and lay in a pool of blood, dying. Nie Gou, the director of the Public Security Bureau, heard the news and immediately led the police to arrest the murderer. That night, the Shen couple were arrested and sent to the county. Tens of thousands of people watched. The couple appeared to be extremely kind and not fierce. It was probably out of cold and hunger that they took the risk.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou - New President of Aviation School Takes Office</h3>
<p>Huang Guangrui, the newly appointed president of the Aviation School, Jiang Jianren, the vice president, and Ding Jixu, the director of education, took office yesterday (1st) morning. At 6:30, an inspection ceremony was held first, and then Jiang, on behalf of Chairman Zhou Zhirou of the Aviation Committee, announced the central government's order, and President Huang gave a speech to all the staff and students, with many words of encouragement. Then, the school's 10th anniversary celebration was held to celebrate.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Celebrates Journalists' Day</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou Journalists' Association held a celebration meeting at Sanyi Building at 12 p.m. yesterday (1st) to commemorate the September 1st Journalists' Day. More than one hundred members attended and held a lunch party. It dispersed at about 3 p.m. and went to various scenic spots in groups. In order to express their celebration, all newspapers suspended publication for one day to commemorate it.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing - Manufacturers' Salt Collection Not Resolved</h3>
<p>The Shaoxing Zhedong Public Factory has stopped collecting Yao salt for more than August due to the sharp decline in sales, which has affected the livelihood of the Yao people. Representatives from the salt farmers have come to Shaoxing many times to negotiate, but there is still no solution. On August 30, the two sides held another meeting at the Zhedong factory to discuss solutions. The factory side could not start collecting salt until the original quota was reduced and the competent official was requested to allocate the plate. It also took a considerable amount of time to prepare to start collecting salt. The salt farmers reluctantly accepted the reduction of the quota, which has already lost 200,000 yuan of salt each year, in order to take care of the factory's sales volume. If they ask the officials to allocate the plate, it will greatly affect the livelihood of all the salt farmers in Yao, and the date of salt collection is not yet determined, which is considered too harsh, so it has not been resolved. At present, the salt farmers intend to petition the commissioner's office to maintain their livelihood.</p>

<h3>Wang Kemin Took a Boat North Yesterday - Said He Would Visit Chairman Han in Jin, Job Not Yet Determined</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reported that Wang Kemin, the newly appointed chairman of the Economic Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, once went north last time, and then returned to Shanghai. A month has passed since then, and he has not yet taken office. Now, Mr. Wang took the Dalian Steamship Company Fengtian Maru from Shanghai with his wife and daughter at 11 a.m. yesterday.</p>

<p>Goes North Again</p>
<p>First go to Qingdao to meet Song Ziwen, standing committee member of the National Economic Committee and president of the Bank of China, to discuss matters, and then go to Jin and then Ping. Before leaving, Mr. Wang met with Zhou Zuomin, chairman of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association and general manager of Jin City Bank, Wu Zhenxiu, president of the Nanjing Branch of the Bank of China, and many other bankers at his residence for a long time. At about 10:30, he went to Huangpu Wharf in Yangshupu to board the ship. At that time, those who went to the ship to see him off included Xu Xiuzhi, former Vice Minister of the Interior, and Fan Dui, Zhao Shuyong and other relatives and friends, as well as Kita, the army attache of the Japanese Embassy in China, Horiuchi, the newly appointed Japanese consul-general in Tianjin, Utsunomiya, the military attache in Shanghai, and Yamamoto, the head of Mitsui Bussan, and more than 20 others. Mr. Wang, before leaving, told the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter on the ship</p>
<p>Made a Speech</p>
<p>Saying that he intends to visit Chairman Han (Fu Ju) when he passes through Jin this time, and then go to Pingjin. Whether he will take office immediately after this trip will be decided after considering the situation after arriving in Pingjin. He will have to return south in a month. As for the issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in North China, there is still no concrete way. He met with Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe the day before yesterday, and he only told me about the meeting with Song (Zheyuan) and Tashiro (commander of the Japanese garrison in North China) last time, without giving any opinions. I also did not express any opinions. I met with Finance Minister Kong the day before yesterday, but did not talk much, because Finance Minister Kong is not very clear about this. Mr. Huang Yingbai is ill and recuperating in the hospital. I only made a phone call to him a few days ago and did not visit him. It is said that he is going to Japan, which is probably not true. Although Mr. Wang said that whether to take office is still to be decided, according to the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter's investigation, Mr. Wang's residence in Heyi Village on Yuyuan Road has been returned, so it seems that he will definitely take office.</p>

<h3>Resignation of the Spanish Consul-General Ferrer</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post reports that, according to a statement by Mr. Ferrer, the Spanish Consul-General stationed in Shanghai, he has resigned from his position because the government in Madrid is now controlled by the Communist Party. He stated that if he remained in office, he would be unable to serve the Spanish people. Therefore, he recently submitted his resignation to the government, which has been approved. Mr. Ferrer also stated that nearly half of the Spanish representatives abroad have already resigned. He firmly believes that the revolutionary army will soon enter Madrid, and that the current war is a matter of life and death for Spain. Although he does not want Spain to fall into the hands of the Communist Party, he said that if that happens, it would be tantamount to announcing Spain's death sentence. It is said that although Mr. Ferrer has resigned, he will remain in Shanghai for some time.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Bank of China to Provide Highway Loans to Various Provinces, Lending Separately to Fujian, Guizhou, Anhui, etc., Total Loan Amount Reaches Over Two Million</h3>
<p>The Kuo Min News Agency reports that the Agricultural Bank of China, recognizing the great relationship between highway construction and the development of rural transportation, and because the opening of highways can make the rural economy increasingly prosperous, has now allocated large sums of money to be lent to various provinces, including the following: (1) Fujian Province's Fuzhou-Ou highway loan, totaling 150,000 yuan; (2) Guizhou Province's Department of Finance highway loan, totaling 500,000 yuan; (3) Anhui Province's Government highway loan, totaling 1,200,000 yuan; (4) Guizhou Province's Dingluo highway loan, totaling 315,000 yuan, for a total of 2,100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Public and Private Institutions in This City Continue to Conduct Citizen Oaths, Members of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce Will Take Supplementary Oaths Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Kuo Min News Agency reports that the citizen oath registration in this city began on the 14th of last month, with civil servants from various government agencies in the urban area taking the lead. Staff members of agricultural, industrial, and commercial professional organizations, as well as residents of the four provinces residing in various districts of the city, have all been held once and must be held once more, in order to be thorough. Therefore, except for residents of various districts, due to the large number of people, those who have not yet taken the oath are difficult to count. It is learned that various state-run departments or enterprises in this city, according to the usual practice, will mostly participate in regional elections in the future. They should first register and take the citizen oath in the nearby districts. However, due to the business relationships of various institutions, or affiliated institutions scattered in various places, it is feared that employees will find it inconvenient to participate simultaneously, resulting in a missed opportunity, which is a pity. It is better to allocate dates and locations in advance, and discuss with the election office to hold the oath separately, which is more strict and convenient. Currently, the First Special District Court, the Second Branch of the High Court, and others have successively sent letters to the National Election Office to separately arrange the oath at their own institutions. The office has also expressed its agreement. Therefore, in recent days, a large number of public and private institutions have continued to hold individual oaths. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Already Held</p>
<p>The First Special District Court, the Second Branch of the High Court, the Second Special District Court, the Auditing Office, the Court Research Institute, the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, the Commercial Press, the Zhenru International Radio Station, and the Central Bank, totaling approximately 7,000 people.</p>
<p>To Be Held</p>
<p>On September 3rd and 4th, the Jiangnan Shipyard and the Shanghai Cement Company and other factories will be held. On the 4th, the Third Factory of the Wing On Textile Company will be held. On the 5th, the Shanghai Silk Steel Factory and the Songhu Garrison Command will be held. Also, on the 4th and 7th, the Two-Road Administration will be held at the North and South Stations of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Wusong Rotary Elementary Schools. Employees and citizens will register for the oath. The National Election Office has assigned personnel to supervise the oath at that time.</p>
<p>Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Associations</p>
<p>In addition, members of the Farmers' Associations (including Fishermen's Associations), Workers' Associations, and various trade associations in all districts of the city will take supplementary citizen oaths on tomorrow (3rd) at the Municipal Farmers' Association, the General Labor Union, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectively. The National Election Office has assigned Lin Meiyan, Lu Jingshi, and Luo Qinghua to supervise the oath at that time. Those who missed the registration and oath last time should seize this last opportunity to perform their obligations, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Pays Attention to the Election of National Representatives, Convening Standing Committees of Various Trade Associations for Discussions and Exchange of Opinions in Batches</h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce is paying close attention to the election of representatives to the National Assembly. It previously convened the standing committee members of its affiliated trade associations to explain the significance and procedures, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the association has also issued the following notices: (1) Notice to the standing committee members of all trade associations in the city, scheduled to convene discussion meetings on the 3rd of this month, in batches at 10:00 AM, 2:00 PM, and 4:00 PM, to exchange opinions; (2) Notice to all trade associations to inform all members and store representatives to supplement their citizen oath registration at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 3rd of this month from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM. This matter concerns citizen qualifications, so do not mislead yourselves; (3) Distribute a summary of the election law, which should be printed and sent to all committee members and members by the trade associations immediately.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Customs Notice: Artificial Silk is Not Prohibited from Export, The Prohibition is Limited to Old Cotton Wadding</h3>
<p>In the Shanghai Customs notice of the 4th of last month prohibiting the export of waste cotton, the inclusion of artificial silk caused the industry to appeal to the central government. As a result, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Customs to lift the ban. After receiving the order, the Shanghai Customs issued Notice No. 1544 yesterday, stating: "Regarding the export of waste cotton, Notice No. 1536 was issued on August 4th of this year. Now, according to the order of the Ministry of Finance, the waste cotton prohibited from export is limited to cotton wadding removed from old cotton quilts and cotton clothes. Artificial silk is not included in the prohibition of export." Therefore, this should be complied with. It is hereby notified to all merchants. Superintendent Zhu Changnian, Customs Commissioner Baronsenne.</p>
<h3>After the Opening of Shanghai-Hankou Wireless Telephone Service, Merchants and People Find it Convenient, Telephone Traffic is Busy, Reduced Telegraph Prices Approved by the Ministry are Implemented Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hankou wireless telephone and the Beijing-Hankou long-distance telephone, which are sponsored by the Ministry of Communications, were opened for telephone service at 0:01 AM yesterday. Because this matter is still being implemented for the first time, Shanghai and Hankou merchants and people all took advantage of this opportunity to make calls, which was very busy. Xu Xueyu, Director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, and Yu Bingjian, Chief Engineer, personally tested the call at 11:55 PM the night before. The result was clear, which was considered satisfactory. It was officially implemented and opened at the scheduled time. In addition, the reduced prices approved by the Ministry were also implemented yesterday.</p>
<h3>Three Associations Including the Silver, Money, and Real Estate Industries Discuss Real Estate Mortgage Rights, Jointly Request Explanation from the Ministry of Justice</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of real estate mortgage rights, the Real Estate Industry Association of this city previously drafted a telegram to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to solicit the opinions of the Banking Association and the Money Industry Association. After the two industries of silver and money submitted it to the Executive Committee for discussion, they believed that it was necessary to jointly request an explanation from the Ministry of Judicial Administration. Because there are many legal ambiguities, they first consulted legal experts to study it in detail. Then, the three associations will convene a joint meeting to discuss, based on the points jointly decided, and separately submit to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Judicial Administration to request an explanation and determine the method of transferring mortgage rights, it is said.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Transfer New Chang Salvage Rights to Italian Merchants</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's No. 1 excellent ship of the Northern Seas, the Xin Chang, sank near Chengshan Cape in Shandong Province in January of the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931) while returning to Shanghai from Tianjin after hitting a reef in the fog. A salvage contract was signed with Japanese merchants Yamamoto and Sato. The Japanese repeatedly sent divers to investigate many times, but it was never implemented. Today, the Japanese suddenly sent a letter to the China Merchants Bureau, stating that they had reached an agreement with the Italian merchant Santo Company and were willing to transfer all the rights and interests of salvaging the Xin Chang to the Italian merchants, seeking the consent of the China Merchants Bureau. After Zhou Fang drafted a method and signed his opinions, he replied to the Japanese and Italian merchants, stating that the China Merchants Bureau would not be responsible for any responsibilities related to the salvage. Regarding the salvage of the hull or other attachments, it was stipulated that the Italian merchants would get seven-tenths and the Bureau would get three-tenths. Now the Italian merchants have already brought salvage machinery and engineering technicians, divers, etc., and have set sail from Shanghai to Chengshan Cape in Shandong to carry out the salvage. The China Merchants Bureau is now telegraphing the Ministry of the Navy to dispatch warships to inspect and protect the Bureau's interests, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Ministries of Finance and Industry Agree to Temporarily Not Prohibit the Export of Wheat, Because of This Year's Bumper Harvest, to Avoid Low Wheat Prices Harming Farmers, and Actively Prepare to Establish a General Bureau for Food Transportation and Sales</h3>
<p>Gu Xinyi, a leader in the miscellaneous grain and flour industry, went to Beijing earlier for the Central Trust Bureau's grain purchase matters and had contact with the Ministry of Finance. He has now completed his official business and returned to Shanghai from Beijing at 7:00 AM yesterday. According to him, after the wheat-producing areas in China had a bumper harvest this year, the Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute estimated it to be 495 million dan. Japanese firms such as Mitsui &amp; Co., believing that China's wheat harvest was abundant and that prices were lower than Australian wheat, purchased large quantities to be transported to Japan for flour mills to produce flour. The Shanghai Flour Industry Association telegraphed the government to quickly prohibit the export of wheat. At the same time, the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association telegraphed the government to quickly find ways to provide relief due to the bumper wheat harvest. After consideration by the Ministries of Finance and Industry, it was believed that there was no risk of high wheat prices in the country at present, and that this year's agricultural harvest was abundant, and various provinces had repeatedly requested relief. To avoid low wheat prices harming farmers, it was not necessary to temporarily prohibit the export of wheat. Now the Flour Industry Association has received a reply from the Ministry of Finance. Regarding the preparation and organization of the General Bureau for Food Transportation and Sales, after the Ministry of Industry transferred it to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry ordered the Central Trust Bureau to handle it. Now, Wu Dingchang, Minister of Industry, believing that the country's rice and wheat harvests were abundant, and to provide relief to the rural areas, it was urgent to establish a General Bureau for Food Transportation and Sales to handle the adjustment of food throughout the country, consulted with Gu Xinyi, a leader in the miscellaneous grain industry, who believed that it was necessary to establish it quickly. It is said that the Ministries of Finance and Industry are currently consulting and actively proceeding, with the aim of transporting rice from rice-producing areas to rice-deficient areas, moderately balancing the surplus and deficiency, so that the country's food supply is evenly distributed.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Issues Two New Types of Banknotes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Central Bank issued two types of five-yuan and ten-yuan convertible banknotes printed by the British Waterlow and Sons Limited. The front of the five-yuan banknote is green, and the front of the ten-yuan banknote is blue. The portrait of Sun Yat-sen on the left side of both banknotes and the name of the bank and the amount of the currency in the center are black. The right side is a watermark of Sun Yat-sen. The back of the five-yuan banknote is gray-green, and the back of the ten-yuan banknote is dark green. The bank announced yesterday that the above-mentioned convertible banknotes would be used in the same way as the five-yuan and ten-yuan banknotes previously issued.</p>
<h3>Tan Zhen and Zou Lin Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>Tan Zhen and Zou Lin took the night express train to Beijing last night.</p>
<h3>Income Tax Collection Issues</h3>
<p>The banking sector in this city is studying the issue. According to the Central News Agency, the income tax provisional regulations and implementation rules for the income tax collection of the Ministry of Finance have been passed by the Legislative Yuan and will be implemented on October 1 for the first category of business profit income, the second category of salary and remuneration income, and the third category of securities deposit income. The collection methods are being drafted. The third category of deposit income refers to the income from interest on various savings deposits. The tax rate is fifty per thousand. Within one month, those who withhold income tax or those who pay income tax themselves must report to the competent collection agency after paying or receiving interest. According to banking sector sources, this tax will be deducted and remitted by the bank, but the amount of the deposit varies, and the deposit period is also fixed and variable, making the calculation quite complicated. The various banks are currently signing opinions and submitting them to the Banking Association for detailed study, and then drafting methods and submitting them to the Banking Association for discussion and decision. After implementation in the future, the various banks will assign some personnel to handle this matter exclusively, it is said.</p>
<p>Opinions of the Hubei Provincial Federation of Commerce</p>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce in this city received a fast-mail telegram No. 279 from the Hubei Provincial Federation of Commerce yesterday. The telegram read: "To the National Federation of Commerce, Provincial Federations of Commerce, and Municipal Chambers of Commerce: A telegram was sent to the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry of the National Government today, stating: 'We have recently received a telegram from the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Commerce, stating that the government's implementation of income tax is considered to be at a time when the people's strength is unbearable, and the exorbitant taxes and levies in various provinces have not been eliminated. There are not yet conditions for implementing income tax, and it is feared that good taxes will produce bad results. Three points of amendment are proposed on the income tax itself: (1) The starting point for the first category should be capital of 5,000 yuan; (2) For the second category, salary income should be levied on those with a monthly income of 100 yuan or more; (3) For the third category, interest income from public bonds should be completely exempt, and income from interest on deposits should also be reduced.' Their words are all based on the actual economic situation, and the association fully agrees. The association cannot help but express its opinion on the heavy income tax. It is found that companies, shops, firms, and factories in Category 1, Item A, have already been taxed once when they have a profit. When this profit is distributed to the shareholders, it must be taxed again according to the third category of stocks, which is clearly double taxation. If one party is not canceled, it will inevitably be too harsh. The nature of income tax and business tax is different. Business operators make a profit once, or there is a profit once, and it is reasonable to tax them repeatedly. However, the income of companies and shops in Category 1, Item A of the Income Tax Law, and the income of stocks in Category 3, belong to the same profit, and of course, they cannot be taxed on both sides. The reason is very clear. The association's opinion is that since the first category of companies and shops has been directly taxed, the third category of stocks should be deleted to avoid double taxation and make it fair. The reason is to add opinions and hope that you will examine and approve it and order it to be discussed together. We are exceedingly expectant. Chairman Su Taiyu of the Hubei Provincial Federation of Commerce, respectfully.'" Matters related to the welfare of merchants are discussed in detail and are not tired of seeking. It is appropriate to telegraph to ask you to review and approve, and if you agree, please appeal together to promote government adoption, to deepen public friendship, Chairman Su Taiyu of the Hubei Provincial Federation of Commerce, respectfully.</p>
<h3>Smuggled Artificial Silk Seized Four Packages Yesterday</h3>
<p>Hua Shigeng and Dai Sen, inspectors of the Smuggling Intelligence Office of the Shanghai Customs, approved by the Ministry of Finance, seized four packages of artificial silk carried by Yang Asi on the 10:30 am of the previous day on Ming Guo Road. It was confirmed that they were smuggled goods and immediately cooperated with police officer Wang Ziming to arrest him.

<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Hires Yang Yinpu as Economic Commissioner to the League of Nations, Yang Went to Beijing Last Night to Negotiate</h3>
<p>According to financial sources, Yang Yinpu, who has long held important positions at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, has been informally contacted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and hired to go to Geneva to serve as an economic commissioner at the League of Nations Office.

After receiving this news, the New Voice News Agency reporter immediately went to the Zhejiang Industrial Bank to inquire about the matter. According to people in the bank, Yang went to Beijing last night, presumably to negotiate about this matter. It was also heard from people close to Yang that it is very likely that Yang will serve as an economic commissioner to the League of Nations. As for the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, it cannot allow him to completely break away, it is said.</p>
<h3>Silk Manufacturers and Exporters Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday, Cash on Delivery, Delivery Limited to the 25th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Wuxi Silk Factory Industry Associations, in view of the usual method of collecting money in the silk industry, which requires payment for raw silk sold to various foreign firms to be made on the day after the foreign firms load it on the ship for export, decided that in all industries, transactions with foreign firms require payment of 80% of the cash after delivery, or a one-time full payment. However, the silk industry is unique. Although it has a history of more than 60 years, in order to reduce risks, it was resolved by the meeting to change the method of collecting money and implement cash on delivery. Before the exporters and various foreign firms of the Exporters Association express their agreement, all September futures will be suspended. Exporters held a joint meeting with silk manufacturers at Dachang Foreign Firm on Hong Kong Road at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss solutions. The meeting was attended by Fu Magali, President of the Exporters Association, Committee Members Kebotuo and Polanannan, and representatives of silk merchants Shen Huachen, Tang Yeqin, and Huang Jiwen from Shanghai, Zhu Jingan from Zhejiang, and Xue Zukang, Zheng Haiquan, and Cheng Bingruo from Wuxi. First, Shen Huachen, a representative of silk merchants, stated the reasons for the resolution of the joint meeting of the three silk factory associations. Then, after a long period of discussion, a decision was made: (1) The 25 hanks of sample silk belong to the silk merchant. However, each package is taken by the silk merchant as a sample silk for the purchasing foreign firm. (2) Permission is granted to change the method of collecting money, that is, the principle of cash on delivery. After the silk merchant sells the goods to the foreign firm, the foreign firm will pay the money when the goods and the official measurement form are inspected and verified. (3) The goods that the silk merchant should deliver must be sent directly to the inspection bureau for inspection no later than the 25th of each month. The meeting adjourned at about 8:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Invites Merchants to Undertake the Construction of the Xuanqu Section of the Railway</h3>

<h3>Smoker Registration in This City Continues to be Extended for Ten Days, Registration Deadline is the 10th of This Month, Final Opportunity, Smokers Pay Attention</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau of this city has been ordered to handle the registration of smokers and the general drug prohibition inspection in this city. The deadline was originally set for the end of last month. Now, because the number of smokers who have registered has been very enthusiastic, it is feared that some smokers have not been able to quit automatically. Therefore, out of consideration for the smokers, it has been specially approved by the Drug Prohibition Supervisor to extend the deadline for ten days, until the 10th of this month. This is the last opportunity for smokers in this city to register for a license or to quit drugs voluntarily. The Municipal Public Security Bureau issued a public notice to this effect yesterday. If they are found after the reporting deadline, they will be sent to the Songhu Garrison Command for severe punishment in accordance with the law, and no further extensions will be granted. Smokers must not delay and mislead themselves and fall into the legal net. The Municipal Public Security Bureau has ordered its subordinate branches and teams to step up house-to-house inspections in order to achieve complete success.</p>
<h3>Rescue Information for the Jian Guo Vessel: Passengers Already Saved, Rescue to Commence After Unloading</h3>
<p>As reported in yesterday's newspaper, the Jian Guo vessel of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ran aground on Qing Tian Reef in the Yangtze River. It is now known that the ship was traveling from Hankou to Shanghai when, at midnight on the 20th, a loud explosion occurred on board as the ship approached Qing Tian Reef downstream from Tongzhou. Upon hearing the explosion, the captain quickly inspected the ship and discovered that the steam pipe of the steering gear had suddenly burst, causing the rudder to break and the ship to lose steering control. At this time, the ship was battered by the current and, without stopping, drifted towards the shallows, resulting in the Jian Guo vessel</p>
<p>Becoming Grounded in the Shallows</p>
<p>When the ship ran aground, the bow was the first part to become stuck. The water depth at that location is eight feet at high tide, but the Jian Guo vessel's draft is eleven feet. Due to the damage to the steering gear, it was impossible to automatically refloat the ship. Yesterday morning, the company telegraphed the Jiang Shun vessel, which had been launched from Hankou, to go to the rescue. The Jiang Shun vessel arrived at approximately 8:00 AM, but could not proceed due to the low tide. Instead, it used sampans to transfer the more than one hundred passengers on board the Jian Guo vessel to the Jiang Shun, which then brought them to Shanghai. Shen Yougeng, the Jian Guo's purser, also came to Shanghai. The Jiang Shun departed at 9:30 AM and arrived in Shanghai at 4:15 PM in the afternoon, with all</p>
<p>Passengers Safely Arriving in Shanghai</p>
<p>They disembarked at the Jin Li Yuan Wharf. Yesterday morning, the company consulted with Jardine Matheson to charter the large tugboat Xue Po Xun, along with three large barges and a team of workers, to rush to Qing Quan Reef to rescue the Jian Guo vessel. Before the tugboat arrived, the company ordered the Jiang Hua vessel, which was traveling upstream, to also attempt a rescue and to bring food and coal to provide assistance. At approximately 6:00 PM last night, the company received a telegram from the owner of the Jiang Hua vessel stating that at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, during high tide (yesterday and today happened to be spring tides), the Jiang Hua vessel used a large steel cable to tow the Jian Guo vessel. The Jiang Hua vessel used full speed to attempt the rescue,</p>
<p>But After Three Hours</p>
<p>It was still unable to pull the ship out of the shallows. It has been determined that the Jian Guo vessel is thirty-one years old and was heavily loaded when it ran aground. If it were towed with great force, there would be a risk of damaging the hull, which would be a major problem. The Jiang Hua vessel stopped work and anchored on the river, waiting for the Xue Po Xun tugboat to arrive. It unloaded the coal and other supplies and then proceeded upstream to Hankou. It is estimated that the Jian Guo vessel will have 1,100 tons of cargo unloaded from its various holds by three barges to reduce the weight of the ship and allow it to float to the surface, as the Jian Guo vessel has a draft of only eight feet when empty. Then, the Xue Po Xun will tow it to Shanghai. According to the person in charge of cargo at the company, the Jian Guo vessel may be rescued this afternoon. Two warships from the Navy Department have already been dispatched to the area to</p>
<p>Protect the Vessel</p>
<p>The Jian Guo vessel is a regular passenger ship. However, because the company does not have any other Yangtze River vessels to send as a replacement, there will be no scheduled ship today. Even if the Jian Guo vessel is rescued and returned to Shanghai, it will need to undergo major repairs in the shipyard, which will be difficult to complete in a short period of time. The cost of hiring tugboats and barges, as well as the cost of repairs, will result in significant losses. After the Ministry of Finance's currency policy is implemented, the banknotes issued by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications are designated as legal tender. The banknotes issued by all commercial banks are to be taken over by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee, and no new banknotes are allowed to be issued. At the same time, the banknotes issued by the China Farmers Bank are specially authorized to be used in the same way as the legal tender of the three banks. Now, all commercial banks that issue banknotes have complied with the Ministry's order. However, all banks that have issued banknotes in the past can use 60% cash reserve and 40% guarantee reserve to obtain marked notes from the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and China Farmers Bank. For example, the marked notes that Zhejiang Industrial Bank obtains from the Bank of China are marked with the word "Yu" and can be used as usual. However, except for the three banks and the China Farmers Bank, the marked note methods of all banks that have issued banknotes in the past have been cancelled one after another.</p>

<p>The remains of journalists Fukagawa and Watanabe, who died in the Chengdu Incident on August 24, were cremated in Chengdu and transported to Shanghai on the China National Aviation Corporation's Chengdu mail plane yesterday morning at 8:00 AM by Fukamachi, the president of the Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, and Tajiri, the director of the Shanghai branch of the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun.

The Municipal Public Security Bureau also issued temporary entry permits to prevent the public from entering the airport. The remains were packed into two urns, wrapped in white cloth, and carried off the plane by four representatives of the Japanese community. The relatives of the deceased then carried the urns onto cars and transported them to the Japanese Club, where a farewell ceremony was held before they were sent to the homes of the relatives. As for Tanaka and Seto, who were injured in Chengdu, they also traveled east on the same plane yesterday. Seto disembarked in Hankou and entered the Hankou Doujin Hospital for treatment.

The factory's general office will be established in Hankou on the 15th of this month, and he will go there to preside over it. The six factories will be established first, and the factory managers have also been appointed to prepare for the establishment of the factories. Oil factories originally located in Hankou and Shanghai will be contacted for acquisition and operation, while the other locations will build their own buildings in order to gradually establish and start operations. Tung oil will be on the market in early January. This year, due to the good price of oil, farmers may harvest and press it earlier, so Shanghai, Hankou, and other places will start operations in mid-October as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at Three British and American Factories: Social Affairs Bureau Investigates Yesterday; Workers Petitioned Party and Government Agencies Yesterday</h3>
<p>The labor and management of the British-American Tobacco Company's Third Factory (renamed Gu Zhong Tobacco Company) on Tangpeng Road in Yangshupu in Shanghai have become increasingly polarized since the work slowdown began, and the dispute has not been resolved for more than ten days. Five representatives elected by all the workers went to the various agencies of the Municipal Party Department, Social Affairs Bureau, and Trade Unions at 10:00 AM yesterday to petition. The authorities agreed to convene both sides for mediation in order to resolve the dispute as soon as possible. At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Zhu Guilin, a mediation officer from the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, was sent to the factory to investigate, but was turned away by the factory, so he was unable to investigate the factory's side. The Party and government agencies have now decided to notify both labor and management to speak within a few days, and then form a mediation committee to formally conduct mediation.</p>
<h3>Tongji University Professor Wu Zhihan Missing</h3>
<p>Wu Zhihan, a doctor of engineering who studied in Germany, left his residence in the French Concession at 6:00 PM on August 31 to go to the Yuebinlou restaurant on Hubei Road to meet with Weng Zhilong, the president of Tongji University. He disappeared en route and has been missing for two days. Inquiries have been made to various police stations and hospitals, but there is no news.

<h3>Dancer Shi Lijuan Sues for Living Expenses: Defendant Fang Jiaheng Absent</h3>
<p>Shi Lijuan, a former dancer from the Vienna Dance Hall and a native of Yixing, is now twelve years old and lives at No. 17, Yongnian Lane, Baike Road. In 1934, Shi came to Shanghai from Hankou to visit friends and stayed in Room 49 of the Old Oriental Hotel. Fang Jiaheng, a wealthy young local man, also had a long-term room in Room 83 of the hotel. He found Shi attractive and pursued her, using all kinds of methods to propose to her, saying that his position as the spouse was still open and he wished to stay together until their hair turned white. Shi had just arrived in Shanghai, her resolve was weak, and she agreed to his request. So, they rented a house at No. 13, Zunde Lane, Xiamen Road, and lived together. Shi repeatedly urged him to marry her, but Fang always prevaricated. Later, he gradually became indifferent to Shi, and then stopped coming to her place altogether, abandoning her. After Shi investigated, she learned that Fang was already married. Realizing that she had been deceived, Shi hired a lawyer to sue Fang for abandonment in the First Special District Court. However, Fang consistently failed to appear in court. Later, because the claim did not meet the legal requirements, she lost the case. Now, Shi has hired a lawyer again to file a lawsuit against Fang in the civil division of the First Special District Court, requesting a judgment ordering Fang to pay 3,992 yuan in compensation. Because she was unable to pay the court fees, she applied for legal aid. This morning, Judge Tao Dejun opened the Fourth Civil Chamber for questioning. Fang Jiaheng did not appear and had no lawyer representing him. Shi explained what happened. Because Fang was not present, the proceedings could not continue, and the court adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Pushes Child, Causing Injury and Death from Being Run Over: Corpse Inspected Yesterday</h3>
<p>Han Yonglai, a native of Shaoxing who runs a scale shop at No. 477, Dong Ao Bili Road, had a son named Hexian, who was only six years old. At approximately 6:00 PM on the 30th of last month, while Hexian was playing on the sidewalk in front of the shop, a rickshaw No. 1088 came from the west. Three people were pulling the rickshaw in front, and one person was steering it in the back. Wang Qingrong, a 46-year-old man from Jiangbei who was pulling the rickshaw on the left side, was not walking on the road, but on the sidewalk. When he reached that spot, he shouted and, seeing that the child had not left, pushed the child, causing him to lose his balance and fall to the bottom of the sidewalk, where his right leg was run over by the rickshaw wheel. After people saw it, they reported it to the police, who quickly sent the child to Shanghai Sanatorium and Hospital. The treatment was ineffective, and he died at 4:00 PM on the 31st. The police station in charge of the area ordered detectives to investigate and transferred the body to the Philand Road Examination Office. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Tang, appointed by the First Special District District Court, arrived at the office to examine the body. After determining the body, he questioned the witness Dong Fanghao and others about what they had seen. Wang Qingrong was questioned, his statement was evasive, and he denied pulling the rickshaw on the sidewalk. The child's father, Han Yonglai, said that he also witnessed his son being injured and requested redress. Prosecutor Tang obtained the statements and then questioned the Western Police Chief Fu Si, asking if the police station had any opinions on the case. The police chief said that the police station believed that the rickshaw puller was not at fault, so no charges were filed. Prosecutor Tang then concluded that the deceased boy, Han Hexian, had died from being run over by rickshaw No. 1088 while still alive. The body was handed over to his father, Han Yonglai, who signed a guarantee to claim it for burial.</p>
<h3>Dai Changrui Sues Tang Yongxin: Hearing Rescheduled for Next Monday</h3>
<p>Wu Jusheng, a woman from Suzhou, also known as Tang Wu, is 21 years old. Two years ago, she was married to Tang Yongxin (33 years old), the son of Tang Jinrong, the owner of the Zhenxing Frame Shop at No. 184, Yuyuan Road, Chenghuang Temple, Shanghai, through a matchmaker. After the marriage, the woman discovered that Tang had a venereal disease and was having an affair, which caused marital discord. Recently, she sued Tang for injury in the Shanghai District Court, demanding a divorce, but the case was dismissed on the 26th of last month. Because of the lawsuit, Wu temporarily resided in the home of a relative at No. 9, Lixian Lane, Zilaihu Street, French Concession. On the 11th of last month, Tang Yongxin suddenly gathered a group of people and went to No. 9, Lixian Lane, where he beat Wu and injured her. She reported the incident to the French police, who arrested Tang and took him to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. The hearing continued on the 29th of last month, and Tang Yongxin was found guilty of assault and fined ten yuan. Now, Dai Changrui, a resident of Suzhou and the second landlord of No. 9, Lixian Lane (a clerk at the Wu Bao Law Firm), has filed a complaint in the criminal division of the Second Special District Court, accusing Tang Yongxin of assault, illegal entry into a residence, and property damage, and has filed a civil suit seeking compensation for damages. After reviewing the complaint, the court summoned them to the Second Criminal Chamber yesterday morning with Judge Qiu Huanhu presiding. According to the plaintiff Dai Changrui, on the night of August 11, the defendant's wife, Tang Wu, came to my house to use the phone to inquire about the lawsuit in the district court with her attorney. While they were talking, the defendant arrived with a group of people, first beating Tang Wu and then smashing the objects in my house. My brother heard the noise upstairs and came downstairs, and was also beaten and slightly injured. The defendant and the others then fled. I request an investigation and an order for compensation for the losses. The defendant Tang Yongxin testified that on the night of August 11, I saw my wife and the plaintiff enter No. 9, Lixian Lane, hand in hand. I followed them in and was immediately beaten and fled. Later, he (referring to the plaintiff) called his daughter and brother to beat me. I have bloody clothes and a singlet as evidence. I did not smash anything in his house. The judge asked the plaintiff if he was present when the fight occurred. Dai replied that he was not. The defendant's defense attorney, Mao Xianshen, said that the judge's question about whether the plaintiff was present clearly showed that the plaintiff had fabricated the facts. The defendant has now filed a counterclaim. The court, after reviewing the evidence, stated that the case required the review of the public prosecution file and announced that the hearing would be rescheduled for next Monday.</p>
<h3>Traffic Accident Involving a Truck</h3>
<p>A truck from a certain coal merchant shop in the Baohe Coal Company at the Yongshun Wharf in Nanshi, loaded with a large quantity of coal, was intended to be transported to a certain place for unloading at approximately 10:00 AM yesterday morning. When the truck was moving, a rickshaw came from the opposite direction. In order to avoid causing an accident, the truck urgently moved the engine and drove to the side. Huang Jinkang (39 years old, from Shandong), a clerk at Yuxing Fruit Shop, walked out from the side of the road, hitting his head very hard. Xu A'san on the truck was also injured in the arm by the shock. He was later taken to Shanghai Hospital for treatment by people.</p>

The night before last, he hanged himself from a utility pole at Fengji Wharf in Nanshi. No one knew about it at the time. It was not until yesterday morning that a patrol officer found him and reported it to the Dongjiadu Police Station, which ordered the local head Qin Defang to report to the District Court for an inspection. Prosecutor Xie and examiners appointed by the court arrived at the scene to determine that the death was due to suicide by hanging. The deceased's brother, Zhang Deshan, reported the case and requested to claim the body for burial. The judge instructed him to sign a guarantee for the burial.</p>
<h3>Unfilial Son Assaults His Elderly Father</h3>
<p>Gu Changfa, a farmer in his sixties who lives in Yuanjiatang, Hongqiao Road, on the outskirts of Shanghai, has only one son, named Guanbao, who is now 26 years old. However, Guanbao is not engaged in honest work and is addicted to gambling. Three years ago, Changfa sent him to the Caohejing Vagrant Training Center for rehabilitation. He was released last spring, but Guanbao's wild nature is difficult to tame, and he has recently become even more excessive, often asking his elderly father for money. If he does not get his way, he resorts to beatings. Yesterday afternoon, Guanbao again asked Changfa for money, and when he did not get it, they quarreled. Guanbao punched him, knocking out a tooth and injuring him, causing him to fall to the ground. Later, he was helped up and reported to the police station in charge of the area, requesting that he be arrested and severely punished.</p>

The Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association was established in the ninth year of the Republic of China and has been in existence for over sixteen years. During the May Fourth period, various circles in Shanghai assisted students in Beiping and achieved considerable goals. At that time, the citizens of Shanghai felt that without a lasting and practical organization, it would be impossible to increase national welfare. Industrial and commercial leaders all felt that to make the country prosperous and strong, it was necessary to promote industry first. Therefore, they initiated the Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association. All citizens should join, as promoting national goods is a great duty that the people should fulfill. In the past, thanks to everyone's efforts, considerable results have been achieved. This time, we are launching an expanded solicitation, hoping that everyone can work hard to ensure its success. As the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, I feel even more duty-bound. Now I am also appointed as a team captain. Overestimating my abilities, I am willing to work together with you all."</p>
<p>Successive Speeches</p>
<p>Next, Sun Daosheng reported on the solicitation methods. The opening ceremony will be held at Zheng Yi She on September 5th, and the closing ceremony will be held on October 5th, with announcements in three phases. Then, Yu Qiaqing said, "I was also one of the initiators of the Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association in the past. In the past, people had a deep-rooted concept of favoring imported goods, making it difficult for domestic goods to develop. Now, with the expansion of solicitation, I hope we can pay attention to counterfeit goods that pass off as national goods, so that the national goods industry can develop. The government should also use legal tender to assist industry and engage in production." Wang Xiaolai then spoke, saying that in times of national crisis, it is necessary to treat the symptoms urgently. The current urgent problems are (1) overpopulation, (2) smuggling, (3) economic issues, and (4) unemployment. These four current difficulties cannot be solved without promoting national goods. Subsequently, Lin Kanghou spoke, stating that in promoting national goods, we should not only pay attention to domestic and international situations but also pay attention to overseas situations and develop overseas shipping routes. Finally, Cai Jingjun, Guan Jiu'an, Hu Xiyuan, and others delivered speeches. The meeting ended in joy at 10 o'clock.</p>
<p>Association Declaration</p>
<p>Our association was established in the ninth year of the Republic of China as the only group for the domestic goods production and consumption sectors to resist foreign economic aggression. Its mission is to arouse the enthusiasm of all citizens in the city to love and use domestic goods and to promote the rational progress of domestic goods factory production. For sixteen years, we have been calling and advocating, never daring to forget this purpose. The people of the country have gained a deep understanding of domestic goods, and domestic goods factories have been able to move forward. Our association has made some contribution, however small it may be. But when examining the customs statistics of the past seventy years, the cumulative trade deficit has reached a huge amount of 1.2 million yuan. Even in the third year of the Republic of China alone, the trade deficit reached 500.03 million yuan. The majority of this huge trade deficit is consumed by urban citizens. It can be asserted that the national goods loving psychology of the people of the country needs to be aroused urgently, and the domestic goods factories need to be supported urgently, and our work needs to be redoubled urgently. This is indeed a matter of urgency. Now, at the beginning of the third solicitation conference of our association, we welcome national goods factory groups to participate in cooperation, and especially welcome individuals to enthusiastically join. Whether you are in agriculture, industry, commerce, study, military, or government, all who consider themselves to have enthusiasm for promoting domestic goods are welcome to join us, to promote universally with the spirit of self-reliance and helping others, to expand the solicitation with the principle of self-awareness and awakening others, to guide each other, and to supervise each other. We must make every citizen of Shanghai a soldier on the front line of national goods, and every factory a rear base for domestic goods. Then the mission of our association can be considered complete.</p>

<h3>Search for Counterfeit Money Unsuccessful; Bullets Found</h3>
<p>Recently, Gu Liancheng, a detective from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, arrested Chen Longde, a suspect in selling counterfeit banknotes. He confessed that Qi Ronggui, a native of Anhui residing at No. 8, Lane 366, Dengtu Road, Public Concession, was involved. The day before yesterday, Detective Gu reported to the Huishan Police Station, requesting assistance in the arrest. Chief Constable Wang Shuchen dispatched detectives to secretly go to the address at 11:45 PM, arrested Qi, and searched for counterfeit money without success. Sixty-two Mauser bullets were found in a cloth bag under his bed. All were taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Municipal Council, explained the situation, stating that the defendant denied the counterfeit money case at the police station, claiming that the bullets were collected when selling old goods in Zhabei. He requested an extension for temporary detention, pending transfer by the Public Security Bureau. Detective Wang then reported the incident. The bullets were presented as evidence. When questioned, Qi Ronggui stated that he did not know Chen Longde. He bought a total of 220 bullets. The remaining lead medicine was removed from the copper shell and sold to a copper shop. Regarding the counterfeit banknote incident, a friend named Lao Wu mentioned to him that a certain foreigner wanted him to sell them on commission, and asked "Can you take this on?", to which he refused. The rest of his confession was evasive. Judge Xiao Xiecai ruled that he would remain in custody and the case would be rescheduled for review.</p>
<h3>Accident at Amusement Park: Patron Seriously Injured After Falling from Building</h3>
<p>At approximately 8 PM yesterday evening, at a certain amusement park on Avenue Edward VII, a male patron in his forties wearing a gray silk long gown over a white short shirt and vest, and a white straw hat, fell from the fourth floor of the park, landing near the cashier's room. The personnel and a number of patrons on scene saw the incident and quickly lifted the patron up. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he had already lost consciousness and did not utter a word. The cashier’s office notified the police who arrived on the scene and promptly launched an investigation before having an ambulance rush the injured patron to Renji Hospital for medical attention. The doctors who examined the patron determined that the injuries were too severe and that the patron's life was in grave danger.</p>

All corpses from various locations will be transported to the coroner's office by the Public Security Bureau, and the court will send a prosecutor to the office nearby for examination. Yesterday, he invited relevant agencies to a meeting.

<h3>Robbing Police Equipment and Shooting Police Officer: Lin Weixue Blew Police Whistle Frantically and Died After Being Shot</h3>
<p>Lin Weixue, a 21-year-old policeman from Suzhou in the Public Security Bureau's Caojiadu branch in Huxi, this city, was assigned to serve at the station by the main bureau, and had not yet been there for two months. At around 8 PM last night, he was on duty at the No. 2 post in front of the dormitory of the Central Geological Research Institute on Jessfield Road. Suddenly, two armed bandits, taking advantage of the dim night, rushed forward and robbed Lin of his pistol. The policeman resisted with all his might, while frantically blowing his police whistle to call for help, and tried to draw his gun to defend himself. Fearing being captured, the robbers shot at Lin. One bullet hit the policeman's right leg, penetrating his bladder. He immediately collapsed to the ground in a pool of blood, unconscious with pain. The robbers, seeing what they had done, fled in haste and disappeared without a trace. Nearby police officers heard the whistle and came to the scene, finding Policeman Lin lying injured in a pool of blood. They immediately ran back to the branch to report. The branch chief, Tan Baochou, upon hearing the news, went to the scene himself and sent the injured policeman to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road for treatment. Due to excessive blood loss, he died at around 1 AM this morning. The bureau reported the incident to the main bureau, requesting compensation, and ordered the detective squad of the branch to track down the fleeing criminals and bring them to justice to warn future offenders.

<h3>Peanut Harvest Abundant, Indian Production Reduced</h3>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports that peanuts are an important agricultural product of our country and a major export commodity. They are produced in all provinces, including Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Sichuan, Hunan, Yunnan, Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Hebei. The largest cultivation areas are in Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces. In addition to supplying domestic consumption, peanuts are also exported overseas. Since the 15th year of the Republic of China, the export of peanuts from our country has gradually increased, reaching its peak in the 20th year of the Republic of China, with annual exports reaching over 18 million yuan, ranking tenth among export commodities. This year, the peanut production in our country is very abundant, increasing by one-third compared to last year, while the peanut production in India is not abundant. Therefore, the export of peanuts from our country is expected to improve this year. India is a major supplier in the world peanut market, so the export of peanuts from our country depends on the abundance of the peanut harvest in India.</p>

<h3>Detailed Record of Zhu Atao's Wife-Killing Case: A Major Tragedy Resulting from Minor Disputes; The Murderer Confesses to Being Mentally Unstable</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, at 5:10 PM, a wife-killing bloodbath occurred in front of a noodle shop with the address of 635 near Beishan Road, Tiantong Road. The murderer, Zhu Atao, was arrested on the spot. The deceased, Yang Fengxian, was sent by car to the coroner's office to await examination. Details have already been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning, Detective Xie Guisheng and Detective Zhang Decai of the Shanhui Police Station escorted Zhu Atao to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court, where he was interrogated by Judge Huang Risheng. First, Attorney Zhang Tianyin of the police station filed a public prosecution against the defendant Zhu Atao in accordance with Article 271 of the Criminal Law regarding the crime of murder, and detailed</p>
<p>The Circumstances of the Case</p>
<p>He stated that the defendant, Zhu Atao, is from Pudong, 26 years old, and has been engaged in setting up mutton stalls. Last year, on the fifth day of the twelfth lunar month, he married Yang Fengxian, a 19-year-old Ningbo woman, through a matchmaker. They lived together at No. 9 Taian Lane, Tian'an Road, while Zhu worked at the Xinglong Noodle Shop at No. 633 Tian'an Road nearby, but it was on a voluntary basis without pay, which caused him to feel quite poor. As a result, he often quarreled with his wife, Yang, and their relationship deteriorated day by day. On the 30th of last month, at about 1:00 PM, the defendant, because it was his wife's brother's son's</p>
<p>One-Month Celebration</p>
<p>Went to his wife's brother Yang Arong's house at No. 27 Yuelaifang, Tiantong Road, to drink. He noticed that his wife's clothes were dirty, her shoes were broken, and she had no socks, so he advised her to go home and tidy up her clothes to avoid being indecent. After speaking, Zhu also went out to work in the shop. Unexpectedly, in the evening, Zhu saw his wife walking on the road, still in the same state, and started an argument. At that time, Zhu was slapped twice by his wife. He immediately went home, took the clothes out of the box and pawned them, bought opium with the money, intending to commit suicide, and also</p>
<p>Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>All the belongings in the house without saying goodbye. Zhu was helpless at the time. After thinking about it, he became angrier. So, at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, he secretly hid a mutton knife and went out to find his wife, intending to kill her. Unexpectedly, when he passed the noodle shop at No. 633 Tiantong Road, he suddenly saw his wife walking out of the noodle shop. Without asking why, he pulled out the sharp blade and slashed Zhu Yang's back and buttocks twice, causing her to fall to the ground. But Zhu was still not satisfied and continued to slash her in the thighs and lower abdomen, causing her to bleed all over the ground. The knife wounds were very severe, and she fell into a coma,</p>
<p>Unconscious</p>
<p>Her brother, Yang Arong, called Chinese Constable No. 1604 to arrest Zhu and sent her by car to the Shanghai Sanitarium on Laobazi Road, but the treatment was ineffective, and she died shortly afterward. The body is now awaiting examination at the coroner's office. However, the police station examined the reason for the defendant's wife-killing this time, fearing that there might be other motives, and asked for an interrogation. The defendant, Zhu Atao, confessed, "Since I married Yang, our relationship has been bad. The other day, for my wife's brother's son's full moon, the deceased wore broken shoes with no socks and dirty clothes. I forbade her to go out, but she would not listen and started arguing with me, tearing my</p>
<p>Clothes</p>
<p>And buying opium to threaten suicide, and expressing her unwillingness to be a wife to a poor man like me, and wishing to marry a rascal. At that time, I ordered her to return to Pudong, but she refused. Therefore, a big quarrel broke out, and the deceased also went out in anger. Yesterday afternoon, I</p>
<p>Hid a Mutton Knife</p>
<p>Searching for my wife, I saw her coming out of the noodle shop, so I slashed her right leg and back twice. After she fell to the ground, I slashed her three more times, but I don't know where the last three slashes landed because my mind was already unclear," etc. Judge Huang instructed that the case be adjourned for seven days for further questioning, and the defendant was remanded in custody. Meanwhile, Prosecutor Tang went to the coroner's office to examine the body of the deceased, Zhu Yang, female, who was indeed stabbed to death by her husband, Zhu Atao. The body was handed over to her brother, Yang Arong, to take away after signing a guarantee.</p>

<h3>The Death of the Famous Painter Zhang Xian</h3>
<p>Zhang Xian, professor of Western painting at the Shanghai Art College, was a native of Qingtian, Zhejiang. As a child, he was gifted and fond of art. In 1922, he graduated from the college and then served in the education circles of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. However, he never fulfilled his wish. In 1931, he went to France and studied at the Paris School of Fine Arts. Due to a lack of funds, he worked in a factory at night to support himself through diligent work and study. In four years, he achieved a deep understanding of oil painting and sketching. The great painter Aenaes Laurent called him his top student. In 1927, he returned to China and became a professor at his alma mater. In 1929, his teacher Liu Haisu went to Europe and accompanied him to the Fa Yijia study session. He extensively viewed famous works of ancient and modern times and was influenced by other literary, artistic, political, and educational figures. His life drawing and freehand drawing both reached a state of divine skill, making him a prominent master. In November 1931, he returned to China and resumed his position as a Western painting professor at the art college, tirelessly teaching and guiding future generations. Hundreds of his students admired and respected him. In his spare time, he often painted himself, devoting his life to art without seeking fame or recognition. His colleagues in the art world also competed to praise him. In recent years, he attacked white-line drawing figures in Chinese painting. The lines were dynamic and swirling, purely natural and not artificial. Although it seemed simple, it contained an elusive sense of strength. Those who knew said that Zhang's white-line drawing ladies had the beauty of Jia Long (Li Longmian) and Yu Yu (Ding Nanyu), opening an era in the Chinese art world. He also used the charm of Chinese painting in oil painting, integrating Eastern elements with the Greek tradition, expressing a calm tone and smooth lines, solving the secrets of art. He was truly an outstanding figure among Chinese painters. Unfortunately, he suddenly contracted liver disease during his summer vacation and was mistakenly treated with medicine, leading to his death in his hometown on the 14th of this month. He was only 38 years old. His death was desolate, and friends and relatives were shocked and saddened when they heard the news. Zhang's ambition died with him, and heaven did not grant him a long life. It is truly a great loss to the art world. The only consolation is that he left behind a forest of works, all of which are successful works. Liu Haisu and others plan to launch an orphan education committee for Zhang's orphans, hold a posthumous exhibition of his works on a regular basis, raise education funds for the orphans, and publish a collection of his posthumous works to commemorate him and take good care of his affairs. All students and colleagues at the art college decided to hold a memorial service after the start of school.</p>
<h3>Xie Hengchuang Case Settled</h3>
<p>Xie Hengchuang, a Ningbo native, coal magnate of Yuchang Coal Company (above the Shanghai Women's Bank building on Nanjing Road) and chairman of the Coal Industry Association, was recently sued by Tong Weibin, owner of Yichangtai Construction Factory, in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court for failing to repay a deposit of 16,612 yuan, 2 jiao, and 5 fen in principal and interest. According to the plaintiff's complaint, the plaintiff contracted to build all the Kang Le Cun housing at the intersection of Fuxu Road and Moore Road in 1933, and the defendant later owed 15,496 yuan in construction costs. Because the defendant was unable to pay, the debt was converted into a deposit at the defendant's Yuchang Coal Company after mediation, stipulating a weekly interest rate of 6%. By December 5, 1934, the total debt was 16,612 yuan, 2 jiao, and 5 fen. Because the defendant repeatedly delayed payment, a lawsuit was filed. The court accepted the complaint and Judge Li Liang opened a court session to summon the defendant, Xie Hengchuang. Because Xie Hengchuang was avoiding the summer heat in Lushan, he was unable to attend and only委托 a lawyer to appear in court and request a postponement. Details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that the two parties have reached a settlement out of court during the postponement. Yesterday morning, Judge Li opened a court session to continue the hearing. Both parties were represented by lawyers who presented the settlement terms. The defendant Xie Hengchuang will pay off all the debt within three months, and the defendant will bear the litigation costs. The lawyers for both parties then signed the settlement record in court and left the court.</p>
<h3>Qilintong Ordered to Repay Monk's Loan</h3>
<p>Zhou Xinfang, also known as Qilintong, a famous Shanghai opera performer from Ningbo, 45 years old, lives at No. 282 Gaofu Lane, Pushi Road, and is currently performing at the Golden Grand Theater. He and his mother, Xu, were recently sued by Monk Guangshan from Mount Putuo, with a lawyer, in the Second Special Court for a loan totaling 985 yuan. It is claimed that in 1929, the defendants Zhou Xinfang and his mother, Zhou Xu, borrowed money from the plaintiff Guang twice and handed it over with a voucher. It was stamped with Zhou Xinfang's seal as proof. Later, when the loan was due, they repeatedly delayed payment and requested a judgment ordering the defendants to repay the money. After Judge Wu Xiaoke opened two court sessions and announced the conclusion, a date was set for the verdict. Details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that the verdict was delivered the day before yesterday. Neither party was present in court to hear the verdict. It is reported that the main text of the judgment stated that the defendant should repay the plaintiff's loan principal and interest of 1,000 yuan and bear the litigation costs.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance's Approval of Doubts About Stamping Duplicate Invoices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to inquire whether duplicate invoices should be stamped. Yesterday, it received Approval No. 税字 (tax character) 10552 from the Ministry of Finance: "Your telegram is noted. According to the provisions of Article 3, Paragraph 7 of the Stamp Tax Law, if the original of various certificates has been affixed with stamp tax票, the duplicate should be exempt from stamping. According to the provisions of Article 7 of the same law, when the duplicate is used as the original, it should still be affixed with stamps. Therefore, whether the duplicate should be stamped depends on whether it is used. A delivery invoice is a certificate issued with the goods and given to the customer. The duplicate invoice used by the Huade 工廠 (factory), if it is given to the collector to take to the other party for inspection and is not left in the hands of the other party, cannot be considered as used as the original and can be exempt from stamping. If it is given to the customer, it is used as the original and should still be stamped according to law. You should immediately instruct them to comply with this approval."</p>

<h3>Hu Xiyuan's Radio Speech: A Simple Explanation of Promoting National Products</h3>
<p>I have never been good at giving speeches, but today it is my turn to give a speech. Isn't this a difficult thing? Moreover, everyone is very familiar with the term "promoting national products." However, the topic of my speech today is still these four words. Ladies and gentlemen, think about how broad and familiar this is. Mr. Cai Shengbai, Mr. Pan Yangyao, and many other people who are enthusiastic about national products have already explained it very thoroughly. What else can I say? Isn't this a difficult problem?</p>
<p>Speaking of promoting national products, it is the duty of every citizen, and it is the natural duty of every citizen. This sentence is not to plagiarize other people's old tunes. I think the promotion of national products is something that the public should generally know. There is no need to cite profound theories. I will talk about some simple metaphors that can be understood.</p>
<p>For example, there is a Li Family Village with dozens of households and hundreds of acres of farmland. They are very self-sufficient and do not need to rely on the help of other villages. However, although the Li Family Village has a very good harvest every year, they do not have a rice milling machine. Therefore, the rice they produce every year is either used to pay for milling fees and they ask the neighboring Zhang Family Village to mill the rice, or they first sell the grain to the Zhang Family Village at a very low price, and then buy rice from the Zhang Family Village at a high price to make a living. In this way, although the Li Family Village has a good harvest every year, all its profits are exploited by the Zhang Family Village. Ladies and gentlemen, think about it, if this continues, won't the Li Family Village be poor every day?</p>
<p>Later, a certain Jia in the Li Family Village came up with the idea to buy several rice milling machines, and he milled the grain for the villagers at a very low price to avoid giving all the colorful and green legal tender to the Zhang Family Village. Who knew that most of the people in the Li Family Village were ignorant? Although a certain Jia bought several machines, they did not trust him and still sold the grain cheaply and bought rice back at a high price. Wouldn't this make a certain Jia feel greatly disappointed and discouraged?</p>
<p>In my metaphor, the Li Family Village is our Republic of China, the Zhang Family Village is a foreign country, that is, the great powers, and a certain Jia is of course a domestic factory.</p>
<p>There is another metaphor about human nature. Domestic products are like our own children, and foreign products are like other people's children. We should love, guide, and hope for the development of our own children's careers. This is certain. Would we be willing to love other people's children who have nothing to do with us and turn a blind eye to our own lovely children who are displaced? I think anyone with a human heart would never do this.</p>
<p>The purpose of establishing domestic factories is not entirely for profit, but to recover the money flowing out and preserve the country's financial resources. This is self-evident. All citizens of the Republic of China should support and protect them. How can they ignore the survival of domestic factories and the many employees and workers who rely on making a living, and send precious money to foreign countries?</p>
<p>In the past, our industry was not developed, and almost all the necessities of clothing, food, housing, and transportation were not produced in our country. Even some handmade goods were no longer suitable for practical use due to the evolution of the times. Therefore, we had to seek them from foreign countries. Now, what kind of industry is there that we do not have domestic products? Moreover, some domestic products are cheap and of good quality. Then, to use foreign products again, isn't that crazy?</p>
<p>People who have studied abroad seem to like to use foreign goods. However, I am not saying that all students who have studied abroad do not like to use domestic products. However, there is indeed a part of people who have been gilded abroad who worship foreign goods the most and want to turn their faces into blue eyes and blond hair. Well, speaking of these people, they are all outstanding members of the Republic of China and have profound knowledge. Wouldn't you feel sad when you think about such ingratitude?</p>
<p>According to a survey by the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, the value of foreign imported goods in our country in 1934 exceeded the value of exported domestic products by 494,450,945 yuan in national currency. In 1935, it exceeded 144,340,262 yuan. Just in the first half of this year, it will exceed 126,288,775 yuan. Ladies and gentlemen, our country is now economically exhausted to the extreme. If this continues, I am afraid that those who are now called the rich will become poor, and the current poor will become starving corpses. At that time, even if other countries do not use force to invade, we will have already perished due to economic collapse. This is such a dangerous and terrible thing. We might as well not talk about promoting domestic products. Otherwise, we must practice it ourselves. We must treat the promotion of domestic products like a religion. From now on, except for necessities that are not available in our country, we swear not to buy any foreign goods. We must always have the desire to preserve the country's financial resources. Only then will our Republic of China have the hope of revival.</p>
<p>Now it's time. When I have the opportunity, I will talk to you again next time. Goodbye.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Changes Report for the Second Quarter of This Year (Continued) (Thirty-Fifth Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce)</h3>
<p>— Edited by China Credit</p>
<p>A. Important Industrial and Commercial Changes in April</p>
<p>A. Financial Industry:</p>
<p>1. Opening of the Shanghai Branch of the Sichuan Salt Bank: The head office of the bank is located in Chongqing. In addition to Shanghai, the branch also has two locations in Chengdu and Zigong, and offices in Luxian and Jiangjin. The total capital is 2 million national currency. Recently, in order to develop its business, it has newly established a branch in Shanghai, which was announced to be open on the 14th.</p>
<p>2. Suspension of Business of the British and American China Bank: The bank was established on January 15 of this year in cooperation with the Da Xin Industrial Bank. Initially, it was a Sino-American joint venture. Later, due to the withdrawal of American shares, British and overseas Chinese joined, so it was called a British company. It was registered with the Hong Kong government with a fixed capital of 1 million yuan, but the actual paid-up amount was said to be less than half. The official opening ceremony was just held on the 8th of this month, and on the 30th, it suddenly announced a financial crunch due to a small amount of more than 4,000 yuan, which forced it to suspend business temporarily.</p>
<p>3. Liquidation of Yicheng Qianzhuang: The firm, also known as Yicheng Qianzhuang, just opened in March. The owner is Mr. Qiu Zuxian, with a capital of only a few thousand yuan. After operating until now, less than a month, it announced that it could not maintain. It is almost a special phenomenon in the economic downturn of the market that it closed down one after another with the America China Bank.</p>
<p>B. Industrial Sector:</p>
<p>1. Establishment of Xinfeng Weaving and Printing Silk Cloth Factory: The factory was originally a partnership. Recently, in order to expand its business, the original shareholders decided to add new shares and reorganize into a limited liability company. The capital amount was set at 200,000 yuan, and the full amount has been raised. A founding meeting was held on the 24th, and Mr. Shen Liucun was elected as the chairman and manager.</p>
<p>2. Establishment of Zhongming Machinery Company: The company specializes in manufacturing Zhongming-style wood-charcoal car oil substitute stoves. The factory is located at No. 270 Qiqihar Road. It was officially announced on the 1st of this month. The chairman is Mr. Fan Zhengbo, and the manager is Mr. Tang Yunqing.</p>
<p>3. Reopening of Changming Electrical Appliance Company: The factory initially specialized in manufacturing flashlights and other items. Later, due to fierce competition in the same industry, the managers realized that it was unprofitable, so they specialized in making clocks, which achieved good results. Unexpectedly, the factory suddenly caught fire in January of this year, and all its essence was destroyed, with losses amounting to 200,000 yuan. This time, the shareholders, in view of the difficulty of starting a business in the past, re-collected a capital of 100,000 yuan, built new factory buildings, and reinstalled machines. It was announced to reopen on the 5th of this month.</p>
<p>4. Qingli Zhao Pan of Zhonghua Fengji Glass Factory: The factory originally belonged to a Japanese company. Later, due to operating losses, it was transferred to Mr. Cao Fengbiao, a Chinese businessman, for operation. The business was still considerable. Unexpectedly, the "January 28th" incident broke out. The factory was located on the front line and was completely destroyed by artillery fire. Although Mr. Cao struggled to reopen after the war, the economic downturn enveloped everywhere, and the factory eventually announced Qingli Zhao Pan due to sluggish business.</p>
<p>5. Liquidation of Diantong Company: The company appeared in the film industry in 1934 with a brand-new appearance. The paid-up capital was 100,000 yuan. The general manager was Mr. Ma Jiande. The business was originally said to be good. Recently, due to the harsh environment, it had no intention of operating, so it was officially announced for liquidation on the 30th of this month.</p>
<p>C. Commercial Sector:</p>
<p>1. Opening of Daxing Transportation and Sales Trading Company: The company was initiated by giant merchants such as Du Yuesheng and Lu Bohong, specializing in the transportation and sales of domestic Guangdong local sugar and agricultural products such as beans and wheat in the Yangtze River Basin. The chairman is Mr. Du Yuesheng, and the general manager is Mr. Zheng Zenan. Transactions will start on the 26th of this month, and the opening will be held regularly.</p>
<p>2. Opening of Shanghai Fish Market: The market has been planned and built by the Ministry of Industry for a long time. Initially, it was planned to be completely state-owned. Later, in order to take into account the interests of the fish merchants, the Ministry of Industry changed it to a joint venture between officials and merchants. The fixed capital is 1.2 million national currency, which is a joint-stock company. The general manager is Mr. Wang Xiaolai. The market can open a new era for the transportation and sales of China's fishery in the future.</p>
<p>3. Opening of Shanghai Fuxing National Products Company: The company inherited the original business of the former Shanghai National Products Company. Mr. Chen Zhong and others formed the preparatory committee of Shanghai Fuxing National Products Co., Ltd., and revitalized the business on the original foundation.

<p>1500 Meter Preliminary Round</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM, the 1500-meter preliminary round was held, divided into four groups. The first group had ten people, and the other groups had eleven people each. The top three in each group were selected. In the first group, the Swedish athlete Nyai took the lead from the beginning with wide strides. The German Burtj, the American Keynesham, the Finn Taylori, and the Hungarian Iggri followed in order. The rest of the people also followed closely. There was no change in the three laps. In the last lap, they all accelerated their pace and competed with all their strength. In the last 40 meters, Keynesham stepped up and fought hard with Nyai, but the distance was too close, and he failed by one lap. Burtj also fell behind by only half a step. The competition in the second group was very fierce. They proceeded one after another in the first three laps, and there was no change. In the last lap, the American athlete Vinsky, who was originally in the crowd, started to sprint and took the lead. The British Cenes and the New Zealander Laflock also sprinted with all their might. When they reached the finish line, they were almost on the same line, and it was difficult to tell who was better. The French Litonne sprinted later and fell behind by half a step. In the third group, the Canadian black Edwards led all the way. In the last 60 meters, the Italian Beckley and the Hungarian Sabey went shoulder to shoulder and exceeded. The British Graham also stepped up and exceeded. Edwards used all his strength to win the third place. Our athlete Jia Lianren ran well in the first three laps and did not show any weakness. In the last 300 meters, he was exhausted and fell behind by 40 meters, but there was still one athlete 80 meters behind. In the fourth group, the French Cox was originally in sixth place. In the last 200 meters, he started sprinting with all his might, winning by five meters and taking the first place. The German Shaburg, who was originally in first place, ended up in third place.</p>

<p>(51) Football Match: Zero to Two, We Lost to England</p>
<p>The football tournament adopted an elimination system. In the first battle, our country met the founder of football, the English team. It was really an unfortunate thing. The reporter said in the previous newsletter that our team has gathered the best players in the country, dominating the Far East. For decades, the technology is definitely not inferior to any strong team in the country, but the physical strength is not as good as others. It is estimated that the first half will not show weakness, and the second half will definitely fail. As a result, it turned out to be as expected.</p>
<p>European countries seem to know the strength of our team very well. A newspaper the day before yesterday predicted that in the Sino-British football match, there would be no record in the first half, and the British could win two goals in the second half. It was really guessed correctly. The British team did not dare to underestimate us at all before the war. Their coach was even worried about being eliminated by our country. The British Emperor sent a telegram to encourage their players, telling them to work hard and maintain the honor of national skills. The Sino-British football war is valued, which can be seen from this.</p>
<p>The football tournament stipulates that the semi-finals and finals are held at the conference venue. The venue for the Sino-British football match is called CommsonSpartplatz, which is far from the conference venue, but there are more than 10,000 spectators, which is more than any initial audience. Our government representative Dai Jitao and the ambassador to Germany Cheng Tianfang are both guests in the special seats. Five or six hundred students from European countries, including students in Germany, also formed a cheering squad. Of course, there were also many British expatriates watching the game. Japanese players also all set off to watch the big battle on the sidelines. The speed of the British team's movements was indeed not as good as our team's. The difference in physical strength was very far. However, the shooting skills were not seen to be excellent. Otherwise, we would have lost one or two more goals, which would also be expected. The defensive strength of the Chinese side is much stronger than the forwards. First, the goalkeeper Bao Jiaping is definitely meritorious and innocent. Two or three dangerous balls were saved by him. As for the two goals lost, they were all shot in from a distance of ten to fifteen yards in front of the goal. Even if he had three heads and six arms, there was nothing he could do. Tan Jiangbai and Li Tiansheng were even more hardworking. If it weren't for their copper head and iron shovel, the result of this battle would have been unimaginable. Their old-fashioned skills and heroic ball-saving won a lot of applause from the whole stadium. Even the British reporters sitting next to the reporter praised them a lot. The two goals that were missed, of course, they cannot but bear some responsibility. However, the best defense is offense. The ball is always hovering in our area, how can there not be any loss of learning? The central defenders Xu Yahui and Chen Zhenhe still maintain their inherent skills. The offense and defense are organized and reasonable. Huang Meishun's reckless action made the strong British players a little scared, but he was too reckless and violated many rules, and was punished with many free kicks. As for the forwards, Li Huitang was burdened by his reputation and was closely monitored by the enemy. As soon as the ball reached his feet, two or three people came to grab it, so there were few opportunities to move. This is one of the reasons for the weakness of the offensive power. Feng Jingxiang is lively and agile, full of courage, and can be called quiet as a virgin and moving as a rabbit. Sun Jinshun's head and feet are strong and his movements are old-fashioned, but he is too slow and delays many opportunities. Cao Guicheng and Ye Beihua have no achievements to speak of, especially Ye Beihua, who has almost no good performance. With such wings, it is of course as difficult as climbing to the sky to make achievements. As far as the battle strategy is concerned, our team used short passes entirely. Of course, we must be cautious in the face of strong enemies, but there are too many short passes, which allows the enemy to arrange and defend from the loss of value. Furthermore, the speed of passing the ball is not fast enough, so it is often intercepted by the enemy. However, on the whole, in the 90-minute bloody battle, our risk has fully demonstrated the power of the Far East overlord. Although we lost two goals, we did not feel chilly. Let's cut the crap and get back to the topic. At 5:20 PM, the players from China and England lined up in double rows and walked into the stadium with the ball in the hands of the two captains. The whole stadium applauded warmly. They each took one side and practiced shooting. Ten minutes later, the referee called the captains of the two teams to determine the direction. Li Huitang won the first prize and designated to sit facing south from the north. With a whistle, the two sides opened the following formations:</p>
<p>English team</p>
<p>Hill</p>
<p>Fulton Holmes</p>
<p>Pettit Joey Gardiner</p>
<p>Finch Etesden Tawz Kyle Crawford</p>
<p>Chinese team</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping Tan Jiangbai Li Tiansheng Chen Zhenhe Huang Meishun Xu Yahui</p>
<p>Ye Beihua Sun Jinshun Li Huitang Hong Jingxiang Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>No gains in the first half</p>
<p>The English team kicked off first to attack. Ye Beihua stepped forward and intercepted it, passing it to Li Huitang. Li led the troops to advance. After two or three passes, he was blocked by the English central defender and handed it to the forward, who pressed forward. Tan Jiangbai calmly saved the situation, turning danger into safety. The English army attacked again, Kyle raised his foot to shoot, Bao Jiaping caught it squarely and kicked it out. It was intercepted by Joey again, and Xu Yahui grabbed the ball anxiously, violating military regulations, and was penalized with a free kick at 40 yards. Xu turned back to protect and made up for his mistakes. The English army's offensive was very strong, and after two or three rounds, they penetrated deep into the hinterland. Crawford raised his foot and shot forcefully, and Tan Jiangbai's copper head was applauded by the audience. After that, our army advanced twice from the right, but both returned without success. When the enemy attacked us, it also took great pains. At six minutes, Tan Jiangbai was guilty of foul play and was penalized with a free kick at 30 yards. Tawz raised his foot and shot fiercely, flying high out of bounds. In the melee until twelve minutes, Li Huitang led the army to counterattack for the third time, pressing into the enemy's formation, but because of the strict defense, he could not penetrate deeply. Cao Guicheng once shot, but it was caught by the enemy goalkeeper. After that, the two sides were in chaos and both came to a dead end. At 32 minutes, the enemy army committed a handball in the middle of the money, and Huitang kicked it out but was intercepted. At 34 minutes, Ye Beihua got the ball and moved forward quickly, all the way to the baseline, and passed it in with one kick. Feng Jingxiang did not hit the head and missed a good opportunity. At 35 minutes, the enemy army took advantage of our empty defense and flew in. Bao Jiaping guarded the empty goal alone, and the situation was critical. Winterson was eager to win and missed slightly out of bounds. It was extremely dangerous for this ball not to be lost. At 37 minutes, Huang Meishun got the ball and passed it far, and Li Huitang took the opportunity to press forward, but the ball was intercepted by Joey and kicked out in one kick, hitting Huitang's abdomen squarely, causing great damage to his vitality. He stopped for half a minute and fortunately recovered. After that, you came and I went, and no one made any achievements. The first half ended, and everyone was empty-handed.</p>
<p>Losing Two Goals, We Were Finally Eliminated</p>
<p>After eating the lemons, we reorganized our troops and fought again. Our team reversed the previous state and adopted an offensive. The central defenders came out to help the battle, and the momentum was very strong. At four minutes, Cao Guicheng got the ball and passed it to Sun Jinshun. Sun passed two levels and passed it back to Cao Guicheng. At this time, the enemy's rear defense was empty, and he could do whatever he wanted, but Cao Guicheng was one step late, and all hope was in vain. The opportunity was given to the enemy cavalry, which became rampant again, with a surging momentum, waving their spears and pressing forward. Fortunately, the copper head and iron shovel resisted with all their might, and the steel gates also showed their skills many times, so they were not ambushed. However, a wise man will make a mistake, and at eleven minutes, the enemy army came back and Tawz sneaked through the difficulty. At ten yards, he greeted the door and swept angrily. Although the steel gate had three heads and six arms, it was difficult to reverse the tide. Although our army lost one goal, the momentum did not weaken slightly. The forward line tried to cheer up the meaning of the handsome instruction, but it was always off by a millimeter, and the error was thousands of times. At 19 minutes, Huan knocked on the enemy gate, and Jinshun unfortunately fouled. Although he fired a cannon to break the town, he could only win the sighs of the fans. Cao Guicheng woke up from his sleep, drew his bow and shot an arrow, but it flew far away and did not hit the key point. Two minutes later, the enemy cavalry came like hungry tigers pouncing on food, arranging to overwhelm the sea. Li Tan could not save it, and Etesden waved his steel legs and fought hard to save it in front of the door, but he was exhausted and lost another city. The general situation was gone, and after that, our army tried to counterattack many times, but the enemy army firmly cleared the fields, how easy it was, and the troops were withdrawn. With a score of 0 to 1, our team was eliminated.</p>

<h3>Our National World Games Soccer Team Loses to Corinthians in England; Physical Strength Inferior, Losing 2-3 by One Goal; Led 2-0 in the First Half; English Team Scores Three Consecutive Goals to Turn the Tide</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 31st – The Chinese World Games soccer team played its first match in England today, losing 2-3 to the Corinthians team (Islington Corinthians) due to inferior physical strength. The match was held at Arsenal's Highbury stadium, attracting a large crowd.</p>
<p>In the first half, the Chinese team performed admirably, leading 2-1 with excellent teamwork. The five forwards launched fierce attacks, penetrating the enemy territory. The center-back also adopted an offensive approach, providing support from behind. After the start of the match, the Chinese team quickly took the lead, scoring twice in succession. Within twenty minutes, center forward Feng Jingxiang and left inside Li Huitang each scored a goal. Shortly before the end of the first half, Tonington of Corinthians salvaged a goal.</p>
<p>After switching sides, the English team gradually gained the upper hand with their physical strength. Osborne and Lewis scored one after the other, leaving the Chinese team with no chance to retaliate. Li Huitang, center back Liang Rongzhao, and center half Huang Meishun performed best for the Chinese team.</p>
<h3>Qiu Feihai Memorial Tournament This Sunday at the French Club; Matches Scheduled from 2:30 PM, Three Matches Arranged; Tickets at One Yuan, All Proceeds to Benefit Family, Season Tickets and Complimentary Tickets Not Valid</h3>
<p>Mr. Qiu Feihai, a famous Chinese tennis player, passed away in Gulangyu last month due to illness. His passing left his family in dire straits, with almost no means of livelihood. Enthusiastic members of the tennis community in this city, such as Chen Qihao, Hu Xiansheng, and Li Baojun, originally planned to hold several charity exhibition matches at the Country Club grounds last Sunday. The proceeds from ticket sales were to be remitted to Mr. Qiu's family for relief. However, due to the sudden rush of time, they planned to postpone the event. Unexpectedly, the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Association, organized by Westerners, heard of this and expressed great sympathy. They offered to hold a large-scale competition at their club grounds, which has more seating, with all ticket sales for the day donated to Mr. Qiu's family. Details of this have been previously reported.</p>
<p>Match Order Already Arranged</p>
<p>The order of the matches has been arranged by the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Association. It includes a semi-final of the senior grass court tournament, a final of the Roper Cup doubles, and a special exhibition match. It is scheduled to start at 2:30 PM this Sunday (6th) at the French Club grounds on Route Ghisi, Avenue Mesny. Tickets are priced at one yuan each. Season tickets and complimentary tickets will not be valid. It is also reported that in any competition held at the French Club grounds in previous years, the French Club would typically receive 40% of the ticket revenue. This time, they have voluntarily waived this, demonstrating the deep sorrow and sympathy for Mr. Qiu from both Chinese and foreign individuals. All matches, such as the senior grass court semi-final and the Roper Cup final, will be played in a best-of-five-sets format, while the special exhibition match by Lin Ka will be in a best-of-three-sets format. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Corassa vs. the winner between Ma Anquan and Forbes (Senior Singles Semi-Final)</p>
<p>(2) Defore and Bonaventure (England) vs. Carson and Squires (USA) (Roper Cup Doubles Final)</p>
<p>(3) Lin Baohua vs. Carson (Senior Singles Semi-Final)</p>
<p>Cup Donation to Begin Next Week</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Hu Yisheng, a veteran of tennis, initiated a donation drive for the Feihai Memorial Cup due to Mr. Qiu's great contribution to the Chinese tennis community. It has been decided that the drive will begin next Monday. The donation collection point is the Xinhua Trust &amp; Savings Bank branch at 500 Avenue Joffre, at the intersection of Rue Hua Long. Mr. Chen Bugao, the manager of the branch, has always admired Mr. Qiu's skills and morality. His voluntary service this time is commendable. From the donations received, over two hundred yuan will be used to purchase the memorial cup, and the remaining amount will be remitted to Mr. Qiu's family.</p>
<h3>Lawn Tennis, All Groups Enter Semi-Finals</h3>
<p>After the weekend's competitions in lawn tennis, Lin Baohua defeated Masure in straight sets in the second division of the senior singles. Although Carson narrowly defeated his old partner Squires by two to one, he was constantly threatened by Squires and barely avoided defeat, which was very fortunate. Corassa, who had a bye, also won against Judickson by three to zero. Currently, in the semi-finals during the week, Carson, Lin Baohua, and Corassa have already advanced. Only the Ma Anquan vs. Forbes group has not yet been resolved. The Lin Ka semi-final has been scheduled to be held at the French Club on Saturday. This match was originally intended to be a Qiu Feihai memorial match, but it has now been canceled because the memorial match has been rescheduled to Sunday. At that time, Lin Ka will perform another special exhibition. In the open doubles, Masure and Masters defeated Kimura and Uchida in the first week. The second week was taken by Carson and Squires. Lin Baohua and Deford also defeated Phelps and Pantitat in the first week. Since the beginning of the tournament, only He Jiajian and Liu Zeng have entered the second week, with very few others having advanced. In the junior singles, in addition to Xu Demin, Hu Xuguang, and Luo Minmo, who have secured spots in the semi-finals, Zhao Junzhao was defeated by Land Slingeck the day before yesterday. Land was then defeated by Masters in the third week. Currently, the semi-final spot has been secured by Masters, who will face Xu Demin. Masters has been in excellent form recently and is often a strong opponent for Xu in the semi-finals.</p>
<p>Results of Each Group</p>
<p>Lin Baohua 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 defeated Masure (Senior Second Week) Carson 4-6, 7-5, 10-8, 6-2 defeated Squires (Senior Second Week)</p>

<p>Corassa vs. Winner of Masters and Forbes (Senior Singles) on the 6th at the French Club Luo Minmo vs. Hu Xuguang (Junior Singles) To be determined</p>
<p>Xu Demin vs. Masters (Junior Singles) To be determined</p>
<h3>Meilu, Youxing, and Kangti Compete for Second Place in the Xianfang Cup</h3>
<p>In the Xianfang Cup tennis league, apart from Lingnan, which has already won the championship, the competition for second place is the most interesting. Currently, Meilu occupies a decisive position, but Youxing and Kangti are closely following behind and are expected to surpass them, as they each have two groups of matches yet to be played. The organizing committee, in order to expedite the conclusion of the league, has rearranged the order of the remaining matches, with a deadline of this weekend. By then, the second-place winner and the rankings of each team will be easily determined. Furthermore, there are prizes awarded to those who consistently participate and win in both singles and doubles in each group, but this year, due to each team being defeated, no one will receive this small championship, reflecting the intensity of the competition among the teams. The secretariat specially issued an urgent notice yesterday regarding the rescheduled match order, stating that although the Xianfang Cup rescheduled match order has been revised repeatedly, it has not yet concluded, which is regrettable. It is hereby revised again, and it is hoped that everyone will comply and not delay in order to benefit the league affairs. Please do not delay in reporting the match results.</p>

<h3>Problem with Education Fees in Hebei; Education Department Reduces and Distributes Funding to Colleges and Universities; Education Federation Sends Representatives to Petition Song Zheyuan</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Hebei) Due to the Hebei Education Department's reduction of education fees for the 25th year for Hebei provincial middle schools and above in Pingjinbao, it is difficult to maintain operations. Previously, a request was made to the Jicha Political Committee to avoid the reduction, but no approval has been received. The Education Department also stated that it has not received a clear order and will still implement the original resolution. Therefore, a problem has arisen with education fees. As the start of the school year is imminent, each college and university has sent representatives, including Yang Shaozhou and ten others, representing the Pingjinbao Provincial College and University Faculty and Staff Federation, to Pingjin to petition Song Zheyuan and submit a presentation outlining the difficult situation. Details of the situation from each party are as follows:</p>
<p>Presentation to Song Zheyuan</p>
<p>We respectfully note that in order to ensure that the revenue and expenditure of the province's budgeted income and expenditure for the 25th year are balanced, it was proposed to reduce and distribute education funding. Colleges and universities believe that education is a long-term plan for cultivating talent and should be developed step by step. It should not be abandoned due to minor setbacks. We have repeatedly submitted requests to maintain the original state. We also invited Vice President Li Shuhua, President Li Zheng, President Li Linyu, President Mei Yiqi, Professor Shu Xuan of Yenching University, Dean Zhou Xuezhang, Dean Li Jianxun, and other education leaders to represent the position of upholding education in this province and to provide clarification and request subsidies. We were gratified to receive a sincere reply from Chairman Song, stating that the reduced distribution refers to inflated education expenses and not the reduction of school funding. We admire Chairman Song's consistent commitment to education. Since we have received this promise, which is as weighty as the words of a tripod, we should quietly await its implementation. However, the supervisor has not received a clear order, and the government departments have no way to follow it. Now that the start of the school year is approaching, we have inquired in Baoding but have not received any definitive information. Faculty and staff in each school are panicking and feeling uneasy. If this uncertainty continues, it may affect the spirit of education. As faculty and staff, we feel a sense of crisis and dare not remain silent. We have publicly selected representatives to come to your office to request that you promptly order the provincial government to implement the previously communicated decision to the educational leaders in order to prevent the entire province's education from falling into a desperate situation. A solid education can stabilize the hearts of the people. During the previous student petition and strike, we relied on the faculty and staff to remain calm and provide advice from the sidelines, which fortunately resolved the crisis. If the start of this year's school year is affected by reduced funding, it will cause educators to feel insecure and shake the students' desire to learn, which could lead to further concerns for the leader and would be unfortunate for the region. The various reasons why education funding should not be reduced have been fully explained in previous submissions from each school president and a recent letter from the faculty and staff. This information has already been carefully reviewed by Chairman Song, so we will not repeat it. However, we believe it is important to note that the original plan includes measures such as eliminating departments and merging departments and reducing the number of schools. However, the actual savings will be limited. Moreover, the field of aquatic products is related to the recovery of coastal fishing rights and the development of important production in the province, which is crucial to the nation's survival and the people's livelihood. The Aquatic Products College has recently achieved significant results. If it is instructed to actively promote this field, the gains will be substantial. Compared with the current reduction in minimal funding, the gains and losses cannot be reasonably calculated. The departments set up in the Law and Commerce and Women's Normal schools have all been established in consideration of social needs. How can we abandon something due to minor setbacks? Chairman Song is currently recruiting university graduates, and all disciplines such as literature, science, law, and engineering are included, demonstrating that all types of talents are needed. If we hastily abandon a part of a school with a long history and a proven track record due to temporary financial difficulties, it will require twice the effort to restore it in the future. All of this should be carefully considered to avoid reductions. According to our limited knowledge, we have prepared a brief summary for your review. If there are any omissions, the representatives can provide further explanation during the audience. Respectfully submitted to Chairman Song of the Jicha Political Committee. Submitted by the Faculty and Staff Federation of Colleges and Universities in Pingjinbao.</p>

<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Remain Stagnant, Market Trading Also Very Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw extremely stagnant and range-bound market conditions. Both long and short positions largely stood aside and watched. Most retail investors were almost entirely absent from the market, mainly because, before the environment becomes clearer, it will likely remain in a stagnant and range-bound state. Throughout yesterday, there was really no trend to speak of. Apart from two or three that did not fluctuate at all, the opening prices of the rest were mostly slightly better by five cents to one dime. Type Wu was also up by two and a half dimes because it was uniquely small the day before. Since then, trading in each session has become increasingly quiet, and market prices have become increasingly flat. A considerable number of sessions saw absolutely no rise or fall. Even when there were ups and downs, they only jostled with each other within a range of five cents or one dime. Although there were calls for large trades, very few were actually executed, so even a transaction of thirty to fifty thousand was enough to attract attention. It is feared that it will not be easy to break the dull situation for the time being. As a result, only the June 96 and Type Ding bonds fell slightly by five cents to one and a half dimes this month. The rest continued to rise by nine cents to one dime, or two dimes. The total transaction volume was $2.69 million. The results of the rise and fall are listed in the table below. Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: Hundred Yuan</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Spot Sales Active, Tagged Yarn Still Declines... Influence of Falling Raw Cotton</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon. Initially, spot sales were strong and American cotton rebounded, causing some shorts to cover. However, ultimately, due to the weak trend in raw cotton, it fell back again. Nevertheless, spot demand was quite active, due to the interest of Yunnan, Changsha, and other buyers from inland areas, causing the yarn market to decline (affected by cotton). February futures yarn was listed today, with a rumored opening price of $199.70.</p>
<p>Tagged Yarn Initially Rises, Then Falls</p>
<p>The tagged yarn market opened in the morning, with American cotton firm due to buying by the same industry and short covering. Prices rose by three to six pounds. Furthermore, due to continued activity in spot yarn sales after yesterday evening's close, over 600 bales of large-hair ten-count October futures and over one hundred bales of seventeen-count futures were traded. Market sentiment was therefore boosted, and prices for each month rose by $0.80 to $1. However, as Dafu, Hengyi, Yuda, Runkang, and other firms sold out, prices gradually declined after the second session. As a result, it was similar to yesterday's close. This month's futures remained unchanged, while near and far futures rose by only $0.10 to $0.30. The market was still stable after opening in the afternoon. Suddenly, in the second session, the trend of loose selling on the raw cotton counter became prevalent, and the decline became more pronounced at the third close. As a result, prices fell by $1.10 to $2.20 compared to the morning close. It was found that sellers included Dafu (2,350 bales), Tongji (1,250 bales), Hengyi (2,750 bales), Yuda (1,450 bales), Jinchang (1,600 bales), Gengfeng (1,800 bales), Renfeng (900 bales), Xingchang (1,350 bales), Yichengchang (800 bales), Runkang (2,700 bales), and Xiesheng (1,600 bales).

<h3>Both Longs and Shorts are Selling, Tagged Cotton Plunges by Seventy Cents</h3>
<p>The cotton market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon. As soon as the market price rose slightly, people began to sell. It was also heard that some longs, seeing the deteriorating environment, painfully closed out their positions. Therefore, the market declined very rapidly. February tagged cotton opened for auction this morning at $38.90. The afternoon closing price was $38.20. It is said that it fell sharply by seventy cents in one day.</p>
<p>The tagged cotton market opened in the morning, with Indian cotton flat, American cotton rebounding by three to six pounds, and the yarn market rebounding, boosting sentiment. October to December rose by two dimes to two and a half dimes. Far futures were flat. After the second session, Dafu, Yuda, Hexing, Huamao, Chongan, and other firms successively sold out. However, Yida, Jifeng, Xingchang, Senkang, Shenji, Shengyuan, Tonghe, and other firms all bought in, and the counter was able to maintain. As a result, it only fluctuated by about five cents from yesterday's close. The market opened in the afternoon, and because the weather turned clear, longs closed out their positions and shorts increased their positions, causing the counter to loosen and become unsustainable, declining session by session. As a result, prices fell by sixty cents to seventy cents compared to the morning close. It was found that sellers included Dafu (4,500 dan), Dengji (5,000 dan), Hengyi (1,600 dan), Yuda (8,500 dan), Daji (2,600 dan), Hexing (4,800 dan), Huamao (2,500 dan), Shenji (1,100 dan), Renfeng (1,500 dan), Dachangcheng (2,900 dan), Runkang (10,900 dan), Xiesheng (2,600 dan), Chongan (2,200 dan), Gengfeng (3,100 dan), Xingchang (2,900 dan), Senkang (3,200 dan), Yikang (1,600 dan), Shenji (2,600 dan), Changfeng (3,600 dan), Yuanyi (2,700 dan), Shengyuan (4,300 dan), Tonghe (2,200 dan), Xinchengchang (3,000 dan), and Yikang (3,700 dan).

<h3>American Cotton Prices Fluctuate... Closing Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with each month rising by one to four pounds. Initially, traders, seeing cotton farmers hedging, did not dare to act. However, as traders bought at limit prices, and speculators expected government reports to show a decrease, and that arid areas lacked sufficient moisture, and that Texas had excessive rainfall, there was also considerable buying, and prices rose. Before the close, as hedging increased, some experienced reaction. However, traders and Wall Street still bought, spot demand was sluggish, and some offset previous amounts. The close was firm. It is estimated that spot prices rose by six pounds, and futures rose by three to six pounds. British cotton spot prices fell by one point, and futures rose by four to five points. Indian cotton initially rose due to buying by operators, but weakened due to selling by European exporters. Traders awaited crop reports for Indian and British cotton. It is estimated that Pingguoer fell by half a rupee, Oumula fell by 0.25 rupees, and Bairuoxi rose by 0.75 rupees. Raw electricity is recorded on the left. (Cable from the 31st)</p>

<h3>Piece Goods: Hebei-Chahar Reduces Import Duties, Northbound Sales of Cotton Cloth Suddenly Stagnate, Central China Also Affected</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw a slight return to calm for East Goods because the sharp decline at the end of July had just passed, and month-end deliveries had been completed. The decline in domestic fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth was relatively moderate. Yesterday, there was a continued decline, with each bolt falling by several cents to one dime. Printed and finished dyed cloths all trended uniformly weak. This was mainly because raw cotton was still difficult to stabilize. Several Shanghai-Hankou Chinese factories and Japanese textile mills in Tianjin all resumed operations one after another, and production will increase day by day. Today's announcement of Hebei-Chahar's reduction of import duties means that not only will Chinese goods shipped to the two provinces of Hebei-Chahar be crowded out, but Central China will also be affected. Therefore, the purchase of printed straight-grain, serge, satin, colored serge, melton, all kinds of light and heavy coarse cloth, etc. by the Tianjin group before last week was very active. In recent days, it has become withered. After a series of market weaknesses, the interest of each road has become increasingly faint. The Sichuan group's orders for blue cloth, straight-grain, serge, printed velvet, are still numerous. Shaanxi, Henan, Shanxi, and Shandong various plain and printed straight-grain serge white velvet printed velvet new flower flannel crepe de chine have good purchase appetites, and over 300 pieces were brought in yesterday. Due to the uncertainty of the Guilin situation in Yunnan and Guangdong, the market inventory is exhausted, and there is considerable buying interest. Selling offers are very harsh, and activity is slow. About 400 pieces of fine twill, fine cloth, straight-grain, serge, and flannel were brought in yesterday. The Yangtze River group and inland groups are all waiting and watching due to poor market conditions. There are many telegrams to postpone the handling of trust shipments.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Ningzhou Black Tea Sales to England Still Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the road for Ningzhou black tea to England was still not lonely. The entire city was bought by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. for over 500 boxes, with prices ranging from $28.50 to $33. Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. also had scattered negotiations for Qimen black tea with Jinlong and Tongfu. The market is already brewing. As for the green tea market, it was still the same as yesterday. The trading of drawn-core Zhenmei green tea was quite smooth. Tunxi famous brand Gaozhuang goods again opened to a top price of $128. Weishi Gaozhuang, on account of Chunzhu tea, opened to a top price of $130. The market for goods with excellent quality and manufacturing methods suddenly became sharp. However, due to the abundance of low-zhuang inferior goods in the market, the market price still has no chance to rise.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Tea Industry Association, the green tea market is quiet because various firms are proceeding with matching piles to prepare for the departure of tea ships for Morocco. However, about 1,000 boxes of Yushan Zhenmei, which Xiehe negotiated the day before, at a price of $40, were officially traded yesterday, and Jardine Matheson took in more than 600 boxes of tea from the two Lakes, at a price of $29.75. The tea is still in Hankou and is now being telegraphed to be shipped to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Tong'an Dried Longan Meat Has Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The first batch of new Tong'an Guiyuan meat. It was discovered that on the day before yesterday, the Jinan ship entered the port, and over 30 boxes had already been transported, with Changsheng Dexing, Dongchun Defeng, Jicheng, and other brands all having stock on hand. The samples were seen yesterday, and the goods are still red and bright, and the body is also dry. It is said that the cost is more than ten yuan higher than sea transport. However, recently, the price of Lianzhou Guiyuan meat has been falling, so the market trend seems difficult to sell well. It is estimated that the market will open today.</p>
<h3>The New White Lotus Market Has Stabilized</h3>
<p>Since the emergence of new white lotus seeds, the market has felt depressed due to the softening of production prices. According to recent letters from Lanxi, processing prices have slightly improved, and the market has stabilized. Therefore, the Shanghai market is also trending towards stability. Yesterday, the market price was called at $36-37.</p>
<h3>Metals: Eastern Steel Plates Arrive in China One After Another</h3>
<p>Recently, Japanese merchants have been studying hardware products with great care, so recently, such as Shin Yangyuan, I-beams, black iron sheets, Shin Pan Yuan, angle iron, etc., all have the intention of selling their products. Recently, steel plates have also arrived in China. It was discovered that yesterday and today, such as Mitsubishi, Dagu, and Huishan, all had large quantities of spot goods arriving, which had a considerable impact on the Western goods market.</p>
<p>Special Report</p>
<h3>Hankou New Soybean Prices Reduced to Encourage Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, new early yellow soybeans from Hankou, due to abundant supply and sluggish sales, led sellers to reduce prices to boost sales. As a result, oil mills purchased 5,600 to 5,700 bags, causing prices to plummet by 30 to 50 cents. Jiujiang and Changzhou soybeans were also slightly affected. The sales market remained fragmented, with Fuzhou and Guangdong merchants on this street purchasing 1,300 to 1,400 bags of various Jiujiang soybeans, and over 500 bags of Changzhou cowhide yellow soybeans. Stored soybeans, which had been quiet for a long time, finally moved, with factories buying four truckloads of Bengbu soybeans at prices ranging from 5.70 to 5.65 yuan.

<h3>The Attitude of Bank Clerks Should Be Like This (?)</h3>
<p>— Xi Nan</p>
<p>In recent years, various banks in Shanghai have established branches and offices in areas where local commerce is relatively prosperous and residents are relatively well-off, whether in the eastern or western districts. This is certainly convenient for the general public's deposits, but it is actually done with the intention of expanding their own business. According to future trends, if banks can handle deposit and withdrawal procedures to everyone's satisfaction, who would be willing to keep cash at home and bear the risks themselves? Moreover, putting money in the bank offers some interest, so why not do it?</p>
<p>However, the way current banks treat their customers is really not praiseworthy. Among them, there are indeed many who provide attentive service and handle matters quickly. But there are also many who seem to think that all the gold and silver in the bank are their personal property. They display an air of arrogance, reeking of money, treating customers with indifference. They leisurely read newspapers, put their feet up while chatting, appearing completely unhurried, letting you wait anxiously and stand until your legs ache. The clerk always acts slowly, looking around distractedly. If you urge them a bit, they will glare at you and even mock you. Therefore, some people say that walking into a bank is like walking into a cold storage room, with a chilling atmosphere that makes people uncomfortable. How can customers be treated like this? It only happens with a few bank clerks who lack service ethics and don't value themselves.</p>
<p>The important figures in the bank don't bother to manage these things. In fact, the reason why clerks dare to act like this is because they are following the example set by their superiors. The arrogant attitude they display towards the clerks daily is then passed on by the clerks to the customers. They think this is the proper attitude for a bank employee, and that anything less would not befit their status. Clerks, for the sake of their livelihood, must endure the arrogance of their superiors, which is understandable. But customers are truly the source of their livelihood, yet they are met with scorn. It's a reversal of cause and effect, and a cause for叹息.</p>
<p>Nowadays, quite a few banks, in order to develop their business, collect tuition fees and pay salaries on behalf of others. This spirit of serving the community is deeply admirable. However, the reality is not always as good as it seems. There are indeed banks that handle these matters thoroughly, but many only know how to grab business without making any preparations themselves. When the dates for collection and payment arrive, many people crowd outside the counters, but their response is still limited to handling the usual few customers. No matter how frantically they work, they can't cope. In the end, it only tires out those paying tuition fees or receiving salaries, wasting their efforts. Urging them is ineffective, and there's no way to reason with them. It's all due to the incompetence of the bank manager. If you want the business, you should prepare adequate manpower to handle it. Or, you could stagger the collection and payment dates to save labor. You should also consider the needs of those making payments and receiving money. If they are made to wait a long time, wouldn't that disrupt their affairs? However, these considerations are not within the bank manager's plans. They want to do business, but they don't care about the difficulties and convenience of customers. Alas, such are bank clerks.</p>
<p>Therefore, if banks want to develop their business, they shouldn't think that customers can be treated however they like. If you don't train your clerks and urge them to correct their mistakes and strive for improvement, then no matter how strong your credit is, people will surely leave you with disappointment. At that time, you will be able to catch sparrows with a net, which is the result you should expect from poor customer service.</p>

<h3>Grain: Factories Selling Short... Spot Sales Stagnant, Marked Flour Market Weak, February Has Also Opened, Prices Steadily Declining</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the flour market, after the opening in the morning, prices for all months showed a pattern of first stabilizing and then falling. Quotations for foreign wheat remained sluggish, falling by about 0.25 to 0.20 yuan. When the prices opened, buying and selling were very smooth, as if the forces were evenly matched, so the market atmosphere was still stable. Later, however, factories successively sold short, and spot flour sales did not show vigorous activity. People's hearts thus became uniformly weak. The stock exchange market is primarily based on people's sentiment. If they are optimistic, they expect great success; if they are pessimistic, they are indifferent and lifeless. Therefore, wheat production remains the same, but the surrounding environment has changed drastically. Fearing that actual sales will not keep up, there is still pressure to lower prices. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading was lighter, and the market, while fluctuating, still showed signs of weakness. February has also opened as usual, with an initial price of 3.265 yuan, steadily weakening, and closing at 0.24 yuan, also down 0.025 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Spot Goods Sold Short Recently, Next Month's Wheat Down 0.70 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the wheat futures market, after the opening in the morning, prices for all months initially stabilized and then fell. At first, the drop in foreign wheat was minimal, and people's sentiment was stable. However, the flour market turned downwards, and this year's autumn harvest is expected to be bountiful. Since the main food supply is difficult to raise high, people in the industry cannot help but think of this. People's hearts relaxed, selling pressure gradually increased, and the market generally fell back down. When the market opened in the afternoon, the near-term market remained sluggish because the factories' appetite for spot wheat was not as strong as it was several weeks ago. Therefore, the spot goods of merchants were sold short in the near term, making the market atmosphere even more gloomy, and the decline was greater than in the distant months. February has also opened, with an initial price of 5.30 yuan, and the closing price was 0.03 yuan better. In the spot wheat market, factories are naturally cautious due to the decline in flour sales. It is said that high-quality goods are discounted as much as 0.90 yuan before factories are willing to buy.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Initially High, Then Moderately Revised Down, Dongxin Japonica Alone Rises by 0.20 Yuan</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, various gangs arrived with a total of fourteen or fifteen boats, carrying over three thousand dan of goods. However, sales in this street market still struggled to recover. Only the Weihaiwei gang sold over two hundred packages. Therefore, although the prices of thick and thin rice were stable, medium-quality rice saw varying degrees of depreciation. Duyang tip and Yinbian Yuanping were mediocre. Dongxin's supplies were intermittently reduced due to alternating overcast and rainy weather, and its price alone rose by 0.20 yuan. New tip rice, however, was just as it was.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, over ten boats arrived from various gangs downstream. The market had varied demand: white japonica, sheep tip, and new customer tip were still active; thin rice was average; and the remaining goods were quite sluggish. Market prices: high-quality white japonica were stable, medium-quality and lower-quality rice held steady, thin rice, sheep Du and Bu tip prices were stable, Yuan rice prices were down by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan, new customer tip was up nearly 0.10 yuan, and Dongxin japonica was up 0.20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Advocating for the Domestic Automobile Industry</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>The development of domestic industry is naturally proportional to the progress of transportation construction. In the past, the obstruction of transportation in various parts of our country greatly hindered the promotion and sales of domestic products to the inland, which greatly affected the development of the entire domestic industry.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, national highways have been completed one after another, with over 90,000 kilometers already open to traffic, and over 30,000 kilometers still being planned and constructed. The sales of domestic products to the inland have therefore followed the development of transportation construction and have become much more convenient. However, because our country does not yet have its own automobile industry and relies entirely on imports, it causes huge financial losses every year, and at the same time, it has also created a serious problem of the outflow of economic rights.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard a very gratifying piece of news, that is, industrialists in our country have recognized this and initiated the establishment of the China Automobile Manufacturing Company, with a capital of six million yuan. It is planned to establish the main factory in Wuzhou, Hunan, and a branch factory in Shanghai. Within two years of starting production, it will produce one hundred vehicles per month, and within five years, it will be able to manufacture all parts itself, providing low-priced goods for domestic use. The establishment of this new enterprise can not only recover economic rights, but is also important to our entire industry. It is a major prerequisite for the current national economic construction.</p>
<p>Here, we can also think of the invention of the charcoal car, which is also a major achievement in our country's industry. Judging from the results of the experiments, the performance is excellent, and the fuel consumption is extremely low. Therefore, we hope that the entire industrial sector will actively promote and manufacture them together, so that China's current transportation construction and the entire national industry can be advanced to a newer and higher stage.</p>
<p>In short, at present, we must integrate the transportation construction industry with the development of domestic products. Only through the development of the domestic automobile industry can we recover financial losses and stimulate and prosper industry and commerce. Only through the progress of transportation construction can the transportation of domestic products be facilitated, so that domestic products can penetrate into the border provinces and the remote areas of the country.</p>

<h3>How to Interview Housewives?</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Housewives are the main consumers of domestic goods. If housewives are enthusiastic about domestic goods, the path for domestic goods will naturally be unobstructed. However, how to open up this path is the task of female interviewers. The other day, I heard the speeches of twenty-five volunteers who were acting as female interviewers, and I felt that they were all valuable and had rich experience, so they could be worthy of this position. Based on their opinions, it can be summarized into eight points, which are good references for promoting domestic goods:</p>
<p>(1) It is not advisable to interview housewives after 10 am, because they are about to prepare meals. If you chatter away, you will not only get no results, but also annoy people.</p>
<p>(2) When you meet a housewife, you should not start by directly promoting domestic goods. You must adapt to the situation, not write rigidly, and not speak in platitudes. Look at the current situation and make appropriate remarks. For example, if you see that the housewife is sick, you can talk about the illness. If you see that the housewife is doing needlework, you can talk about sewing experience. If you meet a child, you can talk about education issues. If you meet a female companion, you can talk about domestic issues. In short, engaging conversations are indispensable.</p>
<p>(3) When you meet fashionable housewives, you must not criticize them for not using domestic goods. You should only explain the advantages of domestic goods to them layer by layer so that they can realize it automatically. In particular, you should not talk about being too extravagant or trendy, which will only provoke their anger.</p>
<p>(4) If you meet a stubborn housewife, and one visit is ineffective, you can visit a second time. If she says she doesn't have time today, you can go again tomorrow. Even stubborn stones can nod, and humans will never be permanently unaware.</p>
<p>(5) Housewives all like small advantages. Giving them some discount coupons or samples for them to try may be welcomed by them. In future visits, you can get a lot of results.</p>
<p>(6) When housewives ask us questions, we must first stand in an invincible position. For example, if they ask us if we use domestic goods ourselves, we can declare directly that from head to toe, nothing is not a domestic product. Setting an example is our most important task.</p>
<p>(7) When housewives are unwilling to talk more, we can only say a few simple words or temporarily end the conversation and talk again next time. Talking too much will only make people more disgusted and will certainly not get good results.</p>
<p>(8) It is not advisable to exaggerate, and there is no need to talk about empty words all the time. Be sincere and you may be able to get people to pay attention and adopt our words.</p>
<p>We feel that promoting domestic goods does not require singing high-profile songs or speaking big words. That is, with these eight opinions, female interviewers can do it in practice, and they will definitely get infinite results. Both the interviewer and the interviewee can feel great pleasure.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Shengze Spun Silk</h3>
<p>— Jun Mei</p>
<p>The other day, a newspaper reported that since the beginning of summer, many Western women have switched from uncomfortable Western clothing to Chinese-style robes. To be fair, in summer, Chinese clothing is indeed more suitable for the body than Western suits.</p>
<p>Summer clothing is most commonly made of colored silk, and the spun silk produced in Shengze can meet the needs of this season. Now, I will give a brief introduction to its products: There are many types of Sheng silk, including pu, ling, sha, luo, jie, and juan. The most commonly sold and best quality product is naturally the light, new, flowing, white, delicate, and soft spun silk. There are also more than ten types of this kind of spun silk, depending on weight, width, and name. Generally speaking, lighter and narrower fabrics are suitable for making linings, while wider and heavier fabrics are suitable for making shirts or undergarments. Summer clothing, on the other hand, is most durable and economical when made with steel comb spun silk.</p>
<p>Steel comb spun silk comes in two types: electric machine and wood machine. The electric machine type is more uniform. Both are woven with pure natural silk and extremely fine warp threads, so they are very durable and washable. After washing, the color will naturally turn yellowish-pink, which is quite elegant. After wearing it for a long time, and dyeing it a dark color, it is indistinguishable from a newly made garment. Compared to imported Indian silk crepe and other man-made silk blends, which become dull and even develop holes after washing and dyeing, they cannot be compared on the same day.</p>
<p>As for its value, in the place of origin, each bolt is only about thirteen or fourteen yuan. Calculating by five zhang, each foot is less than three jiao. No matter how weak the purchasing power, it is still considered affordable for the common people. However, most of our countrymen only focus on foreign goods as being noble and fashionable, and discard domestic goods, which are more suitable in terms of function and economy, as worthless. Those who wear them also think they are unsophisticated. We hope that our countrymen will strive to eliminate this habit of self-abandonment!</p>
<h3>Eliminating Negative Psychology in the Domestic Goods Movement</h3>
<p>— Yao Mingran</p>
<p>First, vanity. The word "vanity" is almost always used on women. I often see newspapers, magazines, and monthly publications scolding like this. I certainly can't say that the word "vanity" is used inappropriately, but it is inevitably too focused on women. The world today is a world of equal rights for men and women, so the sanctions on vanity must be jointly responsible for eradicating it. In recent years, the efforts to promote domestic goods have been considerable, but the effectiveness has been meager. Indeed, due to various and multifaceted relationships, the inability to remove vanity is more harmful than the tangible outflow of money. It can simply be said that its latent power is causing the trouble. The only positive way to eliminate it is the joint and practical responsibility just mentioned, and the most easily restrained people are young men and women. If the parents do not sanction the temptation from the outside world, but instead promote and encourage it, they cannot be excused for their guilt. The urgent reform of this kind of psychology is a major event that cannot be delayed!</p>
<p>Second, contempt. It is truly pitiful and laughable to say that the Chinese often despise domestic goods. They think that the promotion of these unique domestic goods texts, records, etc., is ineffective and not worth reading. Indeed, textual propaganda is ineffective, but this can prove the extent of the Chinese people's contempt for domestic goods and their lack of knowledge of domestic goods. They think it's a cliché, and they don't know that the inability of domestic goods to develop, this psychological obstacle, seems insignificant, but in reality, it affects the development prospects of domestic goods, and there is a major crisis. Disasters often arise from subtle things. Fang Xiaoru's famous sentence in "Deep Thoughts" is worth pondering by young and old people. A Western saying is, "Control it by obeying it." Now in such a situation, domestic goods are so declining, we cannot be disappointed and passive, letting it diminish. We must find a way out of the struggle, but to achieve this step, it cannot be done by empty talk. If we do not first defeat such obstacles of domestic goods contempt, I am afraid that there will never be a good way out!</p>
<p>The two negative psychologies mentioned above seem ordinary, but in fact, they are very important, because if you say too much, it will be disgusting to the ear, and you will not pay attention to it. I hope that we will do our best to take joint responsibility and eliminate these two major enemies as soon as possible! The domestic goods movement is quite popular now, so I specifically wrote it out, hoping that if there are any mistakes, we can correct them, and if there are none, we can encourage each other.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Yi Mei)</p>
<p>My office happens to be next to a funeral home. The sound of crying sometimes comes from the woods, which is very sad. However, I have heard it often, and I gradually feel that it is nothing, and I regard the issue of life and death very lightly. The desire for fame and wealth has become even lighter. I hate that I can't drive all those who are suffering from worldly ambition and make them all live next to funeral homes.</p>
<p>Those who take the tram for a long distance may not get a seat for a while, but after ten stops, they will surely get a seat to rest. Reading and working require perseverance, and I believe this even more after seeing this.</p>
<p>Humans are not as good as birds, so the sounds of the city are difficult to compare with the secluded chirping of birds. Humans are not as good as insects, so the noise is far inferior to the subtle chirping of crickets.</p>
<p>The sun is setting, and one or two old laborers, barefoot and unkempt, set up a plank as a table under a rootless tree and move a low stool to eat their dinner. Looking at them, they seem to be in a painting, feeling comfortable and happy, even any restaurant or dining room can't compare.</p>
<p>The "hua" character in "xuanhua" (uproar) is mostly written with the "mouth" radical by the world, not with the "speech" radical, becoming the "hua" character, which is a big mistake. Even those of us who play with writing often write "xuanyi" as "xuanhua," which is laughable.</p>
<p>I have a full of blood, intending to sprinkle it on the desolate deserts. I have two lines of tears, wanting to wave them in the time of green wine and red lights.</p>
<p>Modern youths mostly consider film history and dance classics to be compulsory courses.</p>
<p>Pick new lotus leaves, boil them once, then remove the leaves and save the juice to cook into porridge. The color is light green, and the taste is clear, fragrant, and pleasing. It is a good food for early autumn.</p>
<h3>China Through Foreign Eyes</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>An American named Mr. Arthur Lee once came to China for a three-month trip. After returning to the United States, he published a travelogue in "American Miscellany." He began by saying that the actual China is different from what we imagined. When we stepped onto the Bund in Shanghai, I almost suspected that this was a large commercial port in the West, and almost did not believe that this was the so-called backward China. All I saw was magnificent buildings and the beauty woven together by modern civilization.</p>
<p>Although the City God Temple in Shanghai is slightly lacking in order, the oriental colors are thicker than anything else. The narrow streets, the old buildings, everywhere shows the Chinese civilization, is history created? The city of Venice is an ancient city in Europe, but in Venice, it is already difficult to see the traces of history, because everything has been transformed into modern times. Egypt and India have mostly buried the civilization of history underground. In the City God Temple in Shanghai, I can see the civilization of the Middle Ages, not the civilization of the Middle Ages that is being performed on the stage and on the screen.</p>
<p>The impression given by Beiping is also very deep. The long hutongs are full of non-lonely quietness. Although living in an old Chinese-style house, lacking all modern living facilities, living in it is very comfortable, which is difficult for people living in the United States to imagine. Beiping has the shell of ancient civilization and the spirit of modern civilization. Its environment is suitable for both yellow and white people? It can be suitable for long-term residence, and also suitable for travel. In short, anyone in Beiping can find a suitable angle that suits them, which is stronger than Guangzhou, Hankou, Tianjin, Qingdao, and even Shanghai does not match the beauty and mystery of Beiping. Moreover, the climate in Beiping is better than in Shanghai, with some flavor of northern Germany.</p>
<p>Although in China, I have also seen the pigtails and small feet mentioned in general travelogues and novels, but not many, and especially the pigtails, I can hardly see them. In China, many women have also cut off their pigtails. Men with pigtails seem to be limited to the two classes of farmers and sedan carriers. Women's small feet seem to be more common, but very few women under the age of forty have small feet, and many have already worn high heels, learned to dance, and imitated the lives of Hollywood actresses. Although transportation in China cannot be said to be extremely developed, in modern China, travelers can use trains and cars to travel seven-tenths of China's vast territory. However, it is said that in China, any dialect is difficult to pass beyond a thousand miles, which is a shortcoming. However, in major cities in various countries, it is possible to contact each other in English without any difficulty.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Wu-Yue History and Geography Research Association</h3>
<p>— Wei Juxian</p>
<p>Before recorded history, the Chinese nation migrated from south to north, and culture also migrated from south to north. After recorded history, a part of the nation migrated from north to south, and the cultural artifacts of the south should not be thought of as having migrated from the north. To prove this hypothesis, Neolithic artifacts have been discovered in Jiangnan, which can prove the early culture of Jiangnan. The pottery in the stone tool sites all have geometric patterns, which are completely different from the patterns on pottery in the Yellow River basin during the Stone Age. This can prove that Jiangnan had its own culture, and did not receive the transmission from the north.</p>
<p>The proof of this fact originated from the discovery of stone tools and geometric pattern pottery near Qixia Mountain in Nanjing by the Nanjing Antiquities Preservation Institute in 1930, followed by the discovery of a large number of geometric pottery in Yancheng in Changzhou and Qijiadun in Jinshan. There is the publication of "Visiting Ancient Sites in Yancheng and Jinshan". This aroused everyone's attention. When the Ancient Coin Society was opened in February of this year, Wu Zhihui, Ye Yufu and others discussed the establishment of the Wu-Yue History and Geography Research Association, drafted simple terms, and solicited members. During the preparatory period, Wu City, Yue City, Gusu Terrace, Suiwa Palace, Zuopu pier, and Shaoxing were discovered in Suzhou. A large number of geometric pattern pottery was found, and a large number of stone tools were found in Gudang, Hangzhou. The book "Exploratory Report on the Neolithic Site of Gudang, Hangzhou" was published.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Wu-Yue History and Geography Research Association held its inaugural meeting in Xuegeng Hall of the Shanghai YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge. More than 100 people including Cai Yuanpei attended. There were also stone tools from Gudang, Lake Zhou, pottery from Shao, Songjiang, and Jinshan, and porcelain from Yuyao on display. Hundreds of people from all walks of life watched. At the meeting, the articles of association were approved, Cai Yuanpei was elected as the president, Wu Zhihui and Niu Tisheng were elected as the vice presidents, and Yu Youren, Kong Yongzhi, Ye Yufu, and Chen Lifu were elected as councilors. After the association was established, it will of course actively work on the ancient culture of Wu and Yue, but there must be many stone tools and pottery in Jiangsu and Zhejiang that have not yet been discovered. In addition to hiring the directors of the Education Bureau and the directors of the Mass Education Museum in each county in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces as ex officio members of the investigation committee, they also hired history and geography teachers and Chinese teachers from primary and secondary schools in each county as investigators to investigate local monuments and antiquities. The Wu-Yue History and Geography Research Association will send ten copies of ancient object samples to the education directors of each county in Jiangsu province to send to history and geography teachers and Chinese teachers of various primary and secondary schools for reference. The West Lake Museum will distribute them to the counties in Zhejiang. It is hoped that when stone tools and geometric pattern pottery are encountered in various places, please send a letter to Wei Juxian of the Central Bank of Shanghai so that personnel can be sent to investigate.</p>
<h3>Changing Nests and Matching Phoenixes</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Six: The Iron Face Sees the Heartfelt Words of a Relative, Deceiving the Parrot; The Beautiful Eyebrows Hold a Heroic Spirit, Pawned to Open Kunlun</p>
<p>This kind of person is already outdated in this era. At that time, they were also not liked by the old gentlemen. Because they did not meet the four conditions of feminine virtue, appearance, speech, and work. This day, they were talking to the madam about the young lady's matter. Now that Little Chrysanthemum delivered this tear-soaked handkerchief, how could he not ask? Seeing Little Chrysanthemum indeed standing beside the madam, he asked, "For no reason, why is the young lady crying?" Little Chrysanthemum said, "The young lady is sleeping in bed, not crying. But I saw the handkerchief she was clutching in her hand was soaked, and I guessed she cried." Jiang Haoran smoked two more bowls of tobacco, gazing at the handkerchief, and then said, "Madam, you are too indulgent with your daughter. Such a good handkerchief, letting her use it to wipe tears." Madam Jiang smiled, "Maybe she spilled flower dew on it." Jiang Haoran said, "You see, that's where you're wrong. Little Chrysanthemum has already said it, she was already crying. You are still covering it up for her, saying flower dew was spilled on the handkerchief. Smell it, is it fragrant?" Madam Jiang said, "Ah! Children inevitably throw tantrums. Boys are naughty, girls like to cry, it's the same in every family. Ignore her, and it'll pass, why bother asking?" Haoran shook his head and said, "It's not that simple. There must be some reason for today's crying. Just now you said you had her try on the newly made clothes, right? You also said that she wore the clothes and looked in the mirror, I don't believe it." Little Chrysanthemum, go and call the young lady here, I have something to ask her." Madam Jiang also put on a stern face and said, "The daughter's marriage, it's enough for the father to decide. Those trivial details are all the mother's business, how can a father talk to her about them?" Haoran said, "It's lunchtime now, she should come downstairs. When she comes, I'll just ask her a few questions and reason with her, I certainly won't scold her." Little Chrysanthemum stood in the corner of the table, slowly retreating backward, until there was no way to retreat. Only lowering her head, she rolled her eyes around. Haoran tapped the edge of the table with the tips of two fingers and said, "I told you to invite the young lady, what are you doing here?" Little Chrysanthemum looked at the madam, the madam nodded her chin at her slightly. Little Chrysanthemum then took one step at a time, moving out of the room, and then ran upstairs in a puff of smoke. Menglan was awakened by her giggling footsteps, sat up and rubbed her sleepy eyes. Little Chrysanthemum walked in, first stuck out her tongue, and then smiled, "I've caused trouble." Menglan said, "What did you break again?" Little Chrysanthemum gently told her what had just happened. Menglan frowned, stamped her foot, and said, "You're such a busybody!" Little Chrysanthemum said, "I was just being kind, seeing you had even soaked your handkerchief with tears, I felt so sorry for you. I wanted to tell the madam, to make her feel sorry for you." Upon hearing this, Menglan couldn't help but chuckle, and said, "This has become that idiom, 'A pig looking in the mirror, wrong on both sides'." Alright, I'll go downstairs. If I get beaten, see if you'll feel sorry too. (69)</p>
<h3>Water Crow</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>"Water Crow," that is, a type of crow, but this is a water bird, while the other is a forest bird, which is the main difference. Its color is pure black, shaped like a duck, but larger. At first glance, it seems to have no eyes, but it is not actually without eyes, because the feathers are mixed with the eyelids, so they are not visible. Its nature is to love fish, so fishermen raise them. Those who are good at catching fish are extremely valuable, each head costing twenty or thirty yuan or more, and even ordinary ones cost more than ten yuan. Feeding them is not easy, so water crows are not a breeding species, and those who know them are few.</p>
<p>In my town, the most people who raise water crows are in the Southeast Zhanbang Township and Fei Family Village. Whenever there is a slack in farming, they always use a small boat, holding only a pole in their hand, standing at the stern of the boat, propping it to move forward. Both sides of the boat are water crow houses, numbering more than a dozen heads. Entering the city river, they step on the boat boards with their feet, the sound of which vibrates along the waterfront. Then, they drive the water crow leaders to swim first, and the rest follow in order to compete to enter, disappearing into the water in an instant. The boat moves forward, and the water crows also rush straight ahead. When they encounter a fish, they immediately fight it, catch it, and float up to show their intention to offer a trophy. When the boatman sees this, fearing that they will swallow it, he always uses a pole to hook it, digs the fish out of its beak, and drives it back into the water. Those who catch something are treated in the same way, and the water crows also compete for merit, without slacking off at all. At this time, the fish in the nests on both sides of the bank are startled by the sound, trying to escape and falling into their mouths, none of them can escape. Occasionally, there are huge fish, which are not enough to fight, and they combine their strength to surround them, still fearing they will not win, so they peck at their eyes, first blinding them, and then capture them and lift them up. The courage of the water crow can also be seen.</p>
<p>However, water crows have one characteristic, that is, they lay eggs but cannot incubate them, so they can only take their eggs and have mother chickens work for them. However, after hatching, the chickens abandon them because they are not similar, and they still need human help to grow up. They are fed with mashed small fish and loach every day. They roost in sheds, with horizontal wooden frames to allow them to perch. When they can catch fish, thin money made of twisted grass hearts is first buckled around their necks, so that they cannot swallow the fish, and their two feet are connected with ropes, allowing them to be hooked with a pole. This is why water crows can be tamed and utilized by fishermen. A few days ago, a friend of mine saw this thing and was surprised by it, so he dipped his pen and recorded its outline as above.</p>
<p>Personal Vignettes</p>
<h3>The Success Story of Little Star Shirley Temple</h3>
<p>— Shadow Stagnant</p>
<p>Seven-year-old Shirley Temple became the most beloved star in Hollywood in 1935. She receives 3,500 fan letters every week. Currently, in the film city, she is considered an important asset by a film company with a capital of US$54 million. She is a short girl, her face looks healthy, but not particularly striking. She had measles once at the age of seven, and soon sent to a dance school in Hollywood, which is the stepping stone for children who want to be on the screen. The dimples on her cheeks are very beautiful, and her yellow hair is curled by her mother's own hands. Initially, she was chosen by a scout from a dance school to play a child role in an educational film. Due to unexpected success, her screen life began. Mrs. Temple was particularly concerned about her daughter at that time, and when she heard that a production company needed a child role, she went to apply. In 1934, Shirley Temple starred in "Little Miss Marker" for Fox Films, and the result was particularly amazing. From then on, she became famous day by day, climbing the path to stardom. However, Hollywood film companies have always treated child stars poorly, and they do not understand the true value of child stars. Therefore, at first, Fox did not pay much attention to Shirley Temple. The first time, they only gave her an unimportant child role in a film. As a result, her success made people realize that she had a special film value. She was worth $190,000, but within three weeks, the income had exceeded the company's estimate. The cost of films starring Shirley Temple is very low, roughly between $200,500 and $000. Apart from the writing of the story, the actors and background props do not seem very important. According to the contract, Shirley Temple makes four films for Fox every year, each earning $75,000. The remaining income of $10,000 per week is contributed by fifteen major companies selling underwear, outerwear, toys, books, puppets, etc., using her photos as trademarks or advertisements. In addition to filming, Shirley Temple is also a broadcasting star in Hollywood. Several of her famous songs have been printed more than 400,000 copies. This number is better than the sales of famous songs by Bing Crosby and Jeanette MacDonald.</p>
<p>At such an age, to be so loved, how is her private life? This is certainly very interesting. In fact, she is a very simple girl, and she obeys her mother in everything. Although she is so young, she is extremely fond of and works hard. She rarely gets sick, and her clothes are not very gorgeous, but very neat. She gets up at seven in the morning, reads the books she read the night before several times, and then goes to the fields to learn dance steps. Her breakfast includes fresh fruit, grains, and boiled eggs. Then she goes to the Fox studio to film with her mother. After work, she returns home and studies various subjects under her mother's supervision. In terms of her level, she seems like a nine-year-old child. She will start learning French next year, and if possible, she may make a film with dialogue in French. At half past five, her day's work is over, she returns home and plays with her father, and then prepares for tomorrow's homework. Her nature is to imitate. When she was filming "Little Lord Fauntleroy," she had to go up and down a 45-foot-high staircase, using dance steps at every turn. It was not easy for the photographer to aim the camera to shoot the film so that every line of the staircase was clearly captured, but the result was not bad, and there were no discrepancies between her steps and the lines of the handrail. She is very happy with her work. When filming, it is as easy as other girls playing with dolls. Because she has sufficient artistic talent, it is easy to train her. Before she starts filming a film, as long as the director explains to her how she should perform in this shot, she understands everything after listening to it once. Not only herself, but also the plays of other actors, she knows. After starting to film, if she makes a mistake, she will immediately ask the photographer to reshoot. When she was filming "Little Lord Fauntleroy," she fell once, falling on the electric light, and once her hand was crushed in the gate. She is a sensitive little girl. When she is holding a doll, if one of the doll's hands accidentally falls off, she will cry, and she will be silent and unhappy for at least half an hour. In the Fox studio, she keeps a few rabbits and chickens, and brings an egg back every day to eat for breakfast the next day. She has collected a lot of her own photos, and in the future, she may become the most famous collector of pictures in the world!</p>
<p>Shirley Temple's success has resulted in her family suddenly becoming wealthy. Now, Mr. Temple has built a new house, with a mountain on one side and a large lawn on the other, to prevent people from looking at Shirley Temple through the windows. She has two older brothers. Mr. Temple's life has recently undergone a change. He has been promoted from a flexible employee to a branch manager in the bank. He is also a short man. Other women often come to him unexpectedly, asking him to attend gatherings, because they want to learn from Mr. Temple, so that their daughters also have the opportunity to become Shirley Temple and be on the screen. However, Mr. Temple refuses all such invitations. Mrs. Temple is also paid $500 a week by Fox for managing Shirley Temple.</p>

<p>Self-Treatment for Gonorrhea</p>
<h3>A Proven Effective Treatment for Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine, University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>Although gonorrhea is stubborn and difficult to treat, according to my many years of clinical experience, it is indeed not as terrible as rumored. As long as the patient follows the self-care method, avoids overwork, and takes a preparation made of yellow pigment and vaccine called "Antilin" internally, there will definitely be no difficult events. If taken during the acute phase, it will never turn into a chronic condition and break out into other complications, because the ingredients contained in the medicine, in addition to having the effect of penetrating the membrane and killing bacteria, also have a vaccine to resist toxins, which is distributed in your blood and marrow, so that the hateful gonococci have no way to invade. In two months at most, and half a month at least, vitality is restored and health is regained. What makes this medicine most admirable is that it never relapses after healing. In these two years, I have cured at least more than three thousand patients with gonorrhea with "Antilin," and there has never been a case of relapse. Last month, I cured a patient in the acute phase with "Antilin," and the patient took the medicine for only two weeks before being completely cured, which is the fastest case of a patient being cured with "Antilin." I hereby record it for reference.</p>
<p>The patient, surnamed Shi, is 29 years old and lives in the Tongchunfang on Baker Road in this port. Because of a visit to a prostitute, less than five days later, he broke out with white turbidity, painful urination, swelling of the glans, chills and fever throughout his body, and unbearable pain in his entire penis. He could not sleep at night due to the pain. After I diagnosed and treated him, I immediately gave him "Antilin" to take. After taking the medicine, he immediately felt the pain lessened and urination was smooth. After five days, the white mucus at the urethral opening was greatly reduced. After ten days, it completely disappeared. He only took two boxes of "Antilin," and the acute gonorrhea was completely cured. I examined his urine with a microscope, and it was indeed free of turbidity, which can be said to be fast!</p>
<h3>The Necessary Conditions for Beautiful Breasts</h3>
<p>— Dr. Liu Zhimin</p>
<p>Female chest binding has already been proven by the medical community to hinder physical health, so all women who study health liberate their breasts. Sure enough, high breasts have a kind of magic that makes people admire, and they have become the typical of modern female beauty. It is indeed a condition that modern girls cannot lack, and no one can deny this. Because it not only shows a healthy posture, but the more it swells and rises, the more it can prove her hygienic success. However, this kind of success cannot be expected by women with weak bodies, because the development of women with weak bodies is limited by the weakness of the gonads, and they cannot get satisfactory results, so the buttocks are particularly narrow, the breasts are atrophied, the spirit is not good, and these women often have diseases, such as uterine disorders, menstrual irregularities, etc., which are also common. So, can this kind of woman never enjoy the blessing of health? No, medical scientists have long invented the gonadotropin preparation "Germinal Hormone" for women. All women with atrophied breasts, weak bodies, and irregular menstruation can obtain satisfactory solutions with its great medicinal power.</p>
<p>Popular Medicine</p>
<h3>A Reference for Effective Treatment of Bone and Joint Pain</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>The symptoms of bone pain, the lightest of which are back pain after working, and other pains in both shoulders and the bones throughout the body. More serious symptoms include numbness due to pain throughout the body, even leading to hemiplegia, as well as contracture of the hands and feet, which are extraordinarily painful. The source of the disease is nothing more than early indulgence, unclean blood, excessive uric acid, or being exposed to wind and cold for a long time, with rheumatism accumulating inside. Those with weak resistance will break out before old age, so the treatment method should be early treatment, taking a good medicine that removes toxins and dispels wind, and can be cured.</p>
<p>The patient, Zhang Zhimin, is 48 years old. Because of excessive licentiousness when he was young, his blood became unclean. In addition, he was careless about the cold and heat, and rheumatism accumulated inside. In the past three years, he has felt severe bone pain throughout his body. When the pain occurs, he cannot move and lies stiffly in bed, forming a state of hemiplegia. After ten days, he began to alleviate. He suffered three or four times a year. Last winter, after being introduced by a close relative to take "Strongston's Bone Pain Pills," his bones and joints became relaxed, and his waist and back felt comfortable. Ten months have passed, and he has never relapsed. It can be said that he is fortunate!</p>
<p>Knowledge for Couples</p>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yao Erchang, Doctor of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<h3>Guidance on the Physiology and Diseases of Men and Women After Marriage</h3>
<p>In general, if a couple can follow the principles of medicine to implement physiological hygiene, they will definitely be able to enjoy happiness, not only be healthy but also have a long life. On the contrary, physical loss, shortened life, and pain are unavoidable.</p>
<p>What is the reason for this? Although there are many reasons, the most important thing is the sexual life between couples. A person who is good at taking care of himself must regulate the sexual desire necessary for physiology. In fact, a couple who can carry out a regular sex life can increase the fat in the waist and hip parts. The reason for this is, of course, that regulating life does not damage the spirit. On the one hand, because the sperm produced and consumed physiologically is balanced, an enzyme produced in the sperm can promote the metabolism of the other party's body. Being nourished by this, both spirit and body are thriving.</p>
<p>Therefore, the most dangerous people are those who indulge in lust after marriage without restraint and unknowingly damage their precious bodies. Such people are very strong at first, but slowly weaken and eventually reach a point where they cannot be saved. It is a common occurrence that a beautiful young man with bright complexion and full forehead becomes thin and bony and his body declines within a few months of marriage.</p>
<p>There are also many facts. When young people abuse masturbation and have nocturnal emissions before marriage, many people will break out with premature ejaculation, impotence, and other symptoms after marriage. Some people set foot in flower bushes and contract gonorrhea. The seminal vesicles are corroded by gonococci, and the reproductive glands are destroyed. After marriage, they cannot perform the way of husband and wife. For women, those who have been physically weak before marriage often suffer from menstrual irregularities and difficulty in pregnancy, which can easily create rifts between couples. Therefore, married people should pay special attention to further medicinal remedies. If you want the medicine to be effective, you should each take pure gonadotropin preparations, "Germinal Hormone" for men and women, to thoroughly revitalize their reproductive glands and make a powerful remedy. This medicine can increase the secretion of endocrine, and the ability of metabolism is endless. Menstruation is adjusted. If you have had gonorrhea or nocturnal emissions before marriage, you should quickly treat it again with "Simeto's Sperm-Strengthening Pills." This way, you can eliminate all obstacles, and couples can have a complete and harmonious union, improve their health, and have lovely children to fulfill the mission of being human.</p>

<h3>Recommending the Degree of Damage to the Seminal Gate by Nocturnal Emission and Treatment Methods</h3>
<p>— Dr. Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>To know the degree of damage to the seminal gate by nocturnal emission, we must first discuss how nocturnal emission arises. In many young people with nocturnal emission, they undoubtedly already know that it is entirely caused by the bad habit of masturbation. Especially in the early stage, if you commit the habit of masturbation, the harm is really great. Not only can it turn into spermatorrhea in a very short period of time, but it also puts development in a desperate situation. In particular, the development of the sexual organs is damaged by it. Even if it reaches adulthood, the state of the reproductive organs is like that of a child. The reason is that the body development has not been completed in the early stage. Once masturbation causes nocturnal emission, not only the weak seminal gate is easily damaged, but also the brain nerves are excessively stimulated. Of course, it can make the pituitary gland, which controls the development of the reproductive organs, malfunction; moreover, at this time, its endocrine fluid is lacking, and of course, the development of the reproductive organs will stop. And the spirit will be insufficient, the muscles will become greatly emaciated, night sweats, tinnitus, and pale complexion are almost unavoidable diseases after frequent nocturnal emissions.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, once a person breaks out with nocturnal emission, it proves that the person is already surrounded by danger. If it is not handled properly, he will be surrounded by this danger for the rest of his life and cannot escape. Therefore, nocturnal emission must be restrained, but after nocturnal emission, due to excessive loss of the body, neurasthenia must be cured. If effective treatment is not applied, there is really no talk of health. Now there is a very good treatment, the medicinal power can make the relaxed seminal gate return to the same solid as a copper wall and iron wall, and can make the brain nerves clear, reduce dreams, and neurasthenia can also be cured. This method has repeatedly achieved amazing results, and the number of people cured is countless. Now there is a patient who also implemented this method to restore health and restrain nocturnal emission. I recommend it here for reference.</p>
<p>The patient, Luo Qiuyun, is 21 years old. After practicing masturbation at the age of 17, due to his weak physique, nocturnal emission soon turned into spermatorrhea. His muscles were emaciated, and he was exhausted. After a slight stimulation, he could discharge sperm, so his reproductive organs did not need to be erect to emit. He underwent many treatments, but never saw any results. In April of this year, he was introduced by a friend to take "Simeto's Sperm-Strengthening Pills" in front of Kentucky every night. As a result, the seminal gate was greatly consolidated, and at the same time, he used the gonadotropin preparation "Germinal Hormone" to cure his neurasthenia. Therefore, his brain nerves were unusually clear, and his body and spirit were also very strong. In less than two months, the nocturnal emission was completely cured, and his strong body and health were like two different people from before.</p>
<p>Tips for Quitting Smoking</p>
<h3>The Proven Efficacy of the Tonifying Opium Cessation Method!</h3>
<p>— Physician Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Opium addiction is easy to acquire, but difficult to break, because once the blood is poisoned by opium, countless "platelets" are produced in the blood through stimulation of the red blood cells. The cells of various organs rely on these "platelets" to maintain an improper vitality. If smoking is suddenly stopped, the number of "platelets" greatly decreases, causing white blood cells to stagnate in the blood vessels and cease their transportation work. The cells of various organs completely lose their protection, and the body and mind exhibit various states of unease. Therefore, those attempting to quit suffer from this unease, often failing midway. Only the Tonifying Opium Cessation Method can enhance the body's anti-toxin ability, so that quitting is painless and brings a sense of enhanced vitality.</p>
<p>Wang Shancai, a native of Dongting Mountain, is a merchant in Wuxi. He is forty-four years old and has been smoking opium for eight years. This April, he came to Shanghai seeking to quit. I guided him to use the Tonifying Opium Cessation Method, taking "Reproducton" to enhance his physical strength and nourish his entire body. Simultaneously, he received injections of "Yuwei Cibaoming". From the beginning of the medication, he felt a significant reduction in his opium intake. After taking three boxes continuously, the opium addiction was completely eradicated. His complexion turned rosy, his essence was abundant, his spirit was vigorous, and both his weight and appetite increased. The entire process took only six weeks, a very short cessation period, and he experienced absolutely no pain.</p>

<h3>Methods of Warfare Must Be Humane</h3>
<p>— Zhou Ge</p>
<p>The "Civil War" in Spain has been going on for over a month since the military rebellion in Morocco on July 18. Not only has the mutual attacks not ceased, but the cruelty of the killings are said to be unprecedented in history.</p>
<p>Originally, war itself is cruel. When a cannon is fired, flesh and blood fly everywhere. A novelist described the situation on the battlefield, saying that hot blood splashes like thousands of red flowers, and in those thousands of red flowers, hands and feet writhe wildly. If you close your eyes and imagine it, you can understand the cruelty of the situation!</p>
<p>Therefore, in its informal mediation in Spain, the British government put forward, among other things, the first measure: "Methods of warfare must be humane." What are humane methods of warfare? Does war have to be humane in order to be like a children's "snowball fight," which does not hurt people and is interesting? However, this kind of "warfare" is clearly something that the imperialist countries do not want, because that would be tantamount to dismantling their own stage!</p>
<p>To say that the methods of warfare must be humane is to kill an enemy in a more "civilized" way. For example, "beheading" is changed to "shooting," shooting is changed to "electric chair," and it is best to change the electric chair to eating "sleeping pills." That is a very humane "method"! However, in acute war, in blind war, this so-called chronic "killing method" is useless! Moreover, even if the killing is done in a "humane" way, a living life is put to death!</p>
<p>Therefore, I say that to make the methods of warfare humane is to fundamentally abolish war. However, to fundamentally abolish war, we still need "war" to eliminate "war"!</p>
<h3>Hedgehog</h3>
<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>At dusk, when the sun slanted to the west, covering the foot of the western mountain, the remaining sunlight hung on the treetops in the big courtyard. The cicadas were singing, and the foxtail grass on the wall was swaying in the evening breeze.</p>
<p>The courtyard could be described as quite large. In addition to the quadrangle house (note), the area in the middle was square, with dimensions of more than two zhang both lengthwise and widthwise. The ground was paved with large square bricks. Except for the two intersecting paths necessary in front of the doors of the four houses (east, west, north, and south), the rest of the area was divided into four soil ponds, in which some lovely flowers and plants were planted. Moreover, a large grape trellis was erected in front of the south house's door. People could walk underneath, letting the heavy grapes hang down, watching them turn from green to purple. The sight was very much like a large awning (note).</p>
<p>At this time, my grandmother would break into a smiling face, bring out a bamboo bed and small stools, brew a pot of honeysuckle tea, and bring out her water pipe, which she had used for five or six years. Fanning herself, she would load the tobacco silk time and again, and time and again spit the residual ashes into the soil pond.</p>
<p>At the time, among our sisters and brothers, I was the most favored by my grandmother. Therefore, she would let me lie peacefully on the bamboo bed, use a large banana leaf fan to drive away the poisonous mosquitoes, and hum a few inarticulate tunes when she was happy. Gradually, darkness lowered its wings from the sky, along the grape trellis, and sometimes along the base of the wall. Several small animals were crawling, gray-white, with round bodies, not crawling very fast, sniffing the ground with their noses, as if trying to discover something. Perhaps they were already used to it, they were not afraid of people, gradually approaching the bamboo bed--</p>
<p>--Grandma, hedgehog, hedgehog, I said, jumping off the bed, kicking with my foot, and the body curled into a ball, prostrate and unmoving, retracting its head and not daring to come out, the thorns all over its body defending against external harm.</p>
<p>They often walked out in groups, led by the elders. According to grandmother's legend, this animal has some kind of divine aura. The more there are, the more prosperous the place will be, both in terms of population and career. I understand that this was to stop us from harming them. Sometimes I would laugh, there was no resentment between it and me, why would I go harm it?</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, I once asked our tutor, but the answer I got was still very vague. Later, the Zhang family's mother from the next courtyard told me that when hedgehogs get old, their eyes turn red, like rabbits. They are afraid of wild foxes. No matter how tightly they curl up, they cannot withstand a wild fox's urine. The smell is unbearable to them, which quickly takes away their weak lives. So I wondered if human urine would harm them?</p>
<p>Secretly, while my grandmother was napping, I made friends with the younger brothers of the Zhang and Li families, and with small sticks, we searched for the small cross-courtyard where they entered and exited every day. There, besides some scattered bricks and tiles, there was a shed built between the two walls, under which were placed some useless junk. First, we looked at the brick pile, there were no cracks for them to hide in. Then, we rummaged through the junk, and as a result, we found them all hiding under the rotten cotton, sound asleep. The unexpected raid gave them a lot of shock. There were more than a dozen of them, looking at us in panic.</p>
<p>--Let's try peeing on them! I proposed. My little mind had a strange idea, and of course, there would be no objection.</p>
<p>--Who will pee? Needless to say, it was me. So we rolled out a larger one, peeing, peeing, our eyes fixed on its body, but it didn't move. We waited a long time after we finished peeing, and it still didn't move.</p>
<p>--Maybe human urine is not as potent as wild fox urine? This mystery is forever hidden in the depths of my heart.</p>
<p>After that, I was sent into the social furnace. After that, my grandmother died old, and I could no longer find her loving warmth. After that, I left that courtyard, left that hedgehog. In a blink of an eye, eight years have passed since I went to Jiangnan.</p>
<p>In Jiangnan, I can't see that globular animal. Now, the grapes are about to turn red again. Under the grape trellis, at dusk, perhaps that weak life is still active?</p>
<p>Note: Quadrangle house, a northern bungalow, three rooms on each side, forming four sides.</p>

<h3>Old Horseman</h3>
<p>— Qi Ying</p>
<p>— Mountain Travel Notes, Part 3</p>
<p>When the eastern horizon had just revealed a line of dawn, our group of four set off again, because we planned to reach the foot of the mountain north of Dalong Mountain today to stay overnight. Hurrying along, on the uphill path, we turned our heads from time to time to look back at the small temple in the mountain gorge where we had stayed last night, shrouded in floating mist. The lush green leaves of the sycamore trees covered its entire face, and we could only faintly see its vermilion roof, serene and elegant. This made us deeply feel the nostalgia for this poetic mountain gorge, and we unknowingly slowed down our pace.</p>
<p>After crossing the mountain peak, a flat road suddenly appeared before our eyes. There were one or two tea stalls selling tea on the roadside, so deserted that there was not a single passerby to rest their feet. The proprietresses were all sticking their butts out in front of the stove, making a fire. In one of the tea stalls, an old man was sitting, leisurely smoking a dry tobacco pipe, putting a leg on a long bench, his eyes fixed on the road. At this moment, seeing us walking up the mountain peak, he hurriedly dragged his shoes and ran to us.</p>
<p>"Sirs, sirs, are you going to the foot of the mountain to the north, rushing to Nanchang Prefecture!" The old man asked us urgently, smiling kindly: "Sirs, ride my horses, my horses' steps are steady and fast, they are all young horses, I guarantee you sirs will be satisfied," he gave us a quick glance with eager eyes, seeing that we did not answer, he continued, "Sirs, my horses are grazing in that mountain valley, if you want to ride them, I will go and fetch them immediately!"</p>
<p>This really made us overjoyed. In this deep mountain wilderness</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>On the difficult road, we have walked nearly a thousand miles. Nothing has ever replaced our tired steps. Today, hearing that we can ride horses, we all agreed without question.</p>
<p>The old man led us to sit down in the tea shed, and he ran to let the horses graze. Halfway there, he hurriedly ran back again: "Sirs, sirs, I'll tell you, promise to ride my horses, you must ride my horses, you can take all my money!"</p>
<p>The old man said as if he was worried, ensuring that they would ride his horses, and then the old man ran satisfied to the mountainside!</p>
<p>The wind under the tea shed was as cool as autumn. The sun had just revealed half of its blood-red face at the end of the eastern mountain. A few cicada calls on the treetops, and the barking of dogs occasionally coming from the distant mountainside, increased the loneliness of us walkers.</p>
<p>The proprietress walked up to us with a kind smile, also soliciting her business: "Sirs, drink our tea before you go, it's still early, the water on the stove will boil in a moment!"</p>
<p>The old man released the horses. Halfway up the mountain, we heard the sound of "ding-dong, ding-dong" from the copper bells on the horses' necks. They were several old horses, so thin that only their bones could be seen, as weak as the old man. Before the old man could saddle the horses, we rode off. The old man chased closely beside us, tying the straps on the saddles for us. We only cared about whipping the horses and running, and he fell behind us, panting and shouting, "Sirs, slow down, slow down! The road ahead is not easy to walk, be careful of falling into the valley!"</p>
<p>Finally, his voice became almost weeping: "Sirs, my horses are sick, they are sick!"</p>
<p>We could still hear the proprietress shouting from the tea shed in the distance: "Sirs, drink my tea before you go, it's still early. Old man (calling the old horseman), why are you telling the sirs to leave so early?"</p>
<h3>Fat Pig</h3>
<p>— Li Jie</p>
<p>This is what often made Qinggen the Leper laugh himself awake from sweet dreams: "Hehehehe… fat pig… fat pig." His wife always nagged him, "You worthless monkey, the pig is fat, but feel your own body, how thin you are, a consumptive ghost! Feeding the pig day and night, filling its pen day and night, see who you're busy for?" These words sometimes also stirred up Qinggen the Leper's sorrow. Because there were already rumors outside that Grandpa A'hu was coming to weigh his pig. Of course, he wouldn't pay cash, but offset old debts. For several years, Qinggen the Leper hadn't raised any pigs. No matter how much Grandpa A'hu pressed him, he couldn't catch him by the braid. This time it would be hard to escape? "If that really happens," A'hu thought, "then more than half a year of effort will be completely in vain…"</p>
<p>At dusk, Qinggen the Leper again sent a full bucket of pig feed that his wife had cooked to the pigsty through the back door. "It seems a bit fatter again?" This became a psychological effect. In fact, his pig had already reached the slaughtering period, and it couldn't get any fatter. Isn't that right? Its belly already hung to the ground, walking like a rolling stone. If there were a mirror in the pigsty, reflecting Qinggen the Leper, who was as thin as firewood, and his fat pig together, perhaps the sadness stirred up by this scene would be even deeper. However, Qinggen the Leper himself was oblivious to this. He used all his strength to pour the bucket of feed into the stone trough, put the empty bucket outside the pigpen fence, took a breath, and sat facing the inside on the pigsty threshold, which protruded like his spine, his lifeless eyes flickering as he began to calculate in his head.</p>
<p>"Selling it to Butcher Dun isn't worth it. First, Mao Lao'san's money isn't easy to get. Second, I wouldn't even get any lard or leftover soup. If I kill it on the fifteenth of the seventh month, and sell it door-to-door in the nearby villages, one catty at a time, the money would be immediate. Ancestral sacrifices are held on the fifteenth of the seventh month, and every family needs some meat. I wouldn't have to worry about not selling it all. I'd keep the pig's head, lungs, intestines… the whole family would get to grease their mouths…"</p>
<p>Qinggen the Leper's calculations were correct. At the end of the seventh month, the ancestral hall would collect interest, and at the beginning of the eighth month, the hui loan would be repaid. It all depended on the output of this pig. All his hopes were pinned on this dark pigpen. Usually, he would rather tighten his belt a little, but the pig feed always had to be fed. He would sell people's grain to buy pig feed—soybean cake, chaff—why? To pay off his debt! Qinggen the Leper and his wife were not lazy, but they were flattened by "debt," unable to raise their heads. He himself didn't know what "old debt" he owed Grandpa A'hu. It was said that it was still the rent that his father had owed before his death. If he didn't admit it, Grandpa A'hu was the one who had the power to speak on the land. Who would dare to utter a "no"! Therefore, recently, Qinggen the Leper had become even more worried about the fat pig in the pen. He didn't even have those laughing dreams at night anymore.</p>
<p>However, some people still said happily to Qinggen the Leper, "Leper, you're lucky this year, raising such a fat pig." In fact, these words would only make him want to cry when he heard them. Wasn't that right, Grandpa A'hu had also told him to his face: if the thirteenth isn't paid in full, he would come to weigh the pig early on the fourteenth. He wouldn't let him kill the meat to sell on the fifteenth of the seventh month. Don't even think about greasing your mouth with the pig's head. Not even a single pig bristle would be left. Qinggen the Leper had bowed and knelt to him, but it was completely useless. That night, Qinggen had another laughing dream, jerking upright from the bed:</p>
<p>"What are you saying, what are you saying? Can't a poor person even have a fat pig? What are you saying? I raised the pig with half a year of effort. It ate my grain… you're going to drag it away and eat the meat as it is? Hehehe, you're taking my life, you're eating my flesh… are poor people only doomed to never get ahead?" This made Qinggen the Leper's wife start nagging again: "You miserable wretch, you're dragging your illness around, who are you scaring?"…</p>
<h3>On the Ancient City Wall</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>In that ancient city, quietly lying in the southern wilderness, with a melancholy and aged appearance, I once spent seven different autumns. The changes in life are truly beyond your expectations: in that year, the middle school I was studying at was burned down in a sudden, thunderous change. After the incident calmed down, I no longer needed to walk that cement road to the outside of the north gate every day, waiting for the next semester to begin and continue my studies.</p>
<p>To maintain the safety of the county seat, a full regiment of soldiers was stationed there. Every time I went outside, the grey-clothed animals would always appear before my eyes. It was early autumn: the twilight of the southern autumn was endearing. I would often walk up the ancient city wall in such twilight, sitting alone, sitting, gradually becoming a habit. The twilight on the ancient city wall was truly so gentle and quiet. The sky was deep grey, and the sun had disappeared behind the mountain at some unknown time. Looking to the north, there was a field of mature crops, the ears of wheat swaying in the wind, like a sea of waves. The autumn wind was bringing coolness, and looking at the people walking slowly between the fields, I silently wished them well in my heart. Scattered across the fields were a few families' houses, the distant ones simply becoming small squares, with a wisp of smoke rising from them. In the south, the scenery was completely different, with rows of houses and shops, densely piled together into an ancient city. From time to time, I could hear the clamorous sounds of the market, presenting the inner workings of an increasingly complex commercial society. At such times, I would often hear the bugle calls for assembly or dismissal from the military camp, the metallic bugle calls often reminding me that it was late and I should go home for dinner, but I always lingered until it was completely dark…</p>
<p>Not far from my home, there was a troop of stationed soldiers. Because I went there a few times, I became acquainted with a company commander.</p>
<p>This young company commander was gentle and refined, unlike the rough characters of ordinary soldiers. His courteousness caught my attention. Once, I invited him out to sit and talk on the ancient city wall, and he happily agreed. (To be continued)</p>

Happy to live a life of fishing and wood gathering.</p>
<p>Zhou Zhenyu's Righteous Demon Tale</p>
<p>Yuan Chang (120) Midnight 12:45 AM to 1:30 AM</p>
<p>Opening: "Amiable Banter Between Sister-in-Law and Sister-in-Law" (First Issue of Mimi Collection)</p>
<p>A Dot of Red. Lan, Sister-in-Law and Sister-in-Law. Sister-in-Law, you are so considerate and cherish me dearly. You and I, sisters-in-law, are like sisters. Now it is true, my brother is going to the capital for the examination. I pity you, half of the brocade quilt is empty. I fear only, [Blank space]. I can replace my brother and keep you company. Be your temporary master of the household. Sister-in-law, delicate flowers and tender buds are loved by all. Do not refuse my honeybee to gather pollen tonight. We will pretend to be a real couple. Just as good, dreaming of Wushan's twelve peaks. The beautiful woman heard these words and spat softly. How can a female phoenix become a male dragon? Surely, your heart is impatient living without a man. That's why you want to devour the butcher's meat and be filled with a husband. I will invite the matchmaker to come. Tell her quickly to marry you off. I hope that my brother-in-law is also a cunning fellow. Guarantee that the sharp-tongued girl will not dare to be fierce. The two are mocking each other with words. Pearls and fragrant laughter in the boudoir. That sister-in-law, then speaks of her husband. Says he is, studying hard by lamplight and rooster's crow. Like the, old horse in the stable who neighs for thousands of miles. Not worrying about not meeting Bole. But I don't know, when the golden announcement will arrive. I, with a morning heart, pray for the flying swan. The young woman heard and smiled slightly. Sister-in-law, you are destined to be bestowed honors by the Emperor. My brother is, borrowing your sister-in-law's luck in helping her husband. Only then can he steadily ascend to the palace. This is called an official who is extremely prominent. There is a thousand within. The sisters-in-law, with lotus-like tongues, spoke charmingly. Said that the sister-in-law lowered her head, her face red. Distant mountain-like eyebrows gathered.</p>
