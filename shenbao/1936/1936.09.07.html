<p>英國駐華新大使許芝森爵士。此次來華就任。繞道加拿大及華盛頓。于前日到達東京。據同盟社電傳。許氏于出發前。曾與由華返國之經濟使節李滋羅斯爵士會談。復晤日駐英吉田大使。就中日關係。及以中國為中心的英日兩國關係開誠交換意見。此次過日訪晤日首相廣田及外相有田。商談英日問題及中日外交問題。雖外電所言。似嫌簡略。但我們單從這簡短的幾句話中。不難窺見英日關係的動態。以及英駐華新大使此次訪日的重要性。</p>
<p>一個新任駐華大使。在沒有到任以前。卽開始以對華為重心的英日交涉。在外交的慣例上講。確是超越常態的事實。然而按照目前的國際情勢。我們覺得英日兩國有着共同的需要。是不足怪的。因為英日兩國。倘要重溫舊夢。追尋妥恊約途徑。目前確是絕好的機會。</p>
<p>第一。就對華關係言。目前是英日重新决定協調方針的重要關鍵。現在兩廣問題順利解决。中國統一局面。日漸完成。中日外交。將展開一新的蹊徑。而英日在華的利害衝突。順應着這種新形勢的發展。愈益表面化起來。當然也就愈感到調整的必要。</p>
<p>第二。傳說中的中日談判。目前雖還沒有開始。但不久總會成為事實。而中日關係如何演變。也將于這一交涉中决定其發展的前途。當然。在中日問題覓到共通談判的前提以前。英國的利益關係。是首先不可忽略的事實。因此。在中日的具體談判沒有開始以前。英日兩國交換意見。覓取妥恊約方式。是必要的。</p>
<p>第三。除了以中國為中心的關係以外。國際情勢一般的轉移。也是决定英日關係最近發展的重要因素。西班牙法西斯化的危機。使英國對歐陸的和平外交。更戚棘手。因而對日的態度。不得不傾向妥協。同時。日本也因為對外貿易。最近已打破了五年來的記錄。對于世界市塲發展的前途。抱着極大的殷憂。滿洲旣不是它的理想的天堂。獨占東亞也不是容易實現的事。那麽。從英日妥恊約過程中。實現各個擊破徐圖拓展的計劃。也是日本所願意考慮的。</p>
<p>基於這樣的共同需要。英日妥恊約聲浪。近月來。便時斷時續地透露着。上月初旬。東京發表了霍爾擬定的英日妥協方案。其中一部份說。英國承認「滿洲國」及尊重日本在華北的特殊地位。日本則重申尊重中國領土的「完整」與門戶開放。及尊重英國在華的旣得權益。此次傳說。雖經倫敦當局否認。但一時在英國輿論界。曾引起相當衝動。空穴來風。恐非無因。而日本外交實業各界人員對英活動。則迄今仍未停止。英日召集經濟會議的聲浪。便是由日本首先倡議的。</p>
<p>此次許芝森爵士訪日。以中日外交為中心。進行英日兩國的妥恊談判。雖其結果。未易樂觀。但本着局部的共通的需要。兩國不是沒有成立諒解的客觀基礎。我們希望英日兩國都能謹守着。「中國領土是完整的。中國的獨立主權是神聖不可侵犯的」這一鐵則。來覓取遠東國際關係的永久和平。</p>

<h3>西班牙與革命　（上）</h3>
<p>— 蘇聯I愛倫堡作　賓符譯</p>
<p>一九三一年訪問了西班牙以後，我寫過下面這段話：</p>
<p>「西班牙有着你所希望的一切『目光遠大』的人，然而不幸他們都不瞭解自己的國家。他們生活在黑暗和荒凉的森林中，很少想到他們生存的權利，飢餓的村莊中盡是那些偷取檞樹菓千當飯吃的農民，遍地充滿着腐敗，落後以及傷寒，瘧疾等病症，各種各樣的刑罰和數不淸的監獄，活像中世紀的地牢……</p>
<p>「自從革命以後，西班牙數千條街道改了名。全國是受了一次洗禮了。那封建的，布爾喬亞的王國—那官僚，地主，伯爵，騙棍，以及劊子手的遺產—現在是尊稱為「勞苦大衆的共和國」了。</p>
<p>「但那內衛團—四萬個戴着三角帽的人—郤仍然國時在作打靶的演習，準備來一次盛大的射擊會。</p>
<p>「是的，西班牙出名的不是『卡門』，也不是伊班內茲（Blasco　Ibanez　1867－1728）的小說；不是勒樂（Alejaudro　Lerroux）的外交，也不是南方的葡萄酒。兩千萬衣衫襤褸的「唐·吉訶德」，荒凉的峭壁，深刻的罪惡，像橄欖樹葉子聲響一樣凄慘的歌曲，英勇的罷工者的怒吼，憐憫和同情，——這樣就是眞實的西班牙，西班牙處在離羣的側道上實在太久長了。她以驕傲，無知和寂寞訴於夢想者的幻想也實在太久長了。現在，那西班牙的民族已獲得了生存的慾望；國家也已加入勞働，奮鬥和恨的世界中了」。</p>
<p>當我這本書的譯本在那裏出版時，頗引起了共和黨報紙的憤慨。共中有一家甚至要求外交抗議禁止在國外傳佈這種「虛妄」的報告。但在我最近一次到西班牙的遊歷中，我碰見了這家報紙的代表。他嘆了口氣對我說：「不幸你的話竟是對的」。</p>
<p>在表面上這個國家似乎沒有變更過。喀勃拉魯（Caballero）的子弟們仍舊成羣的到阿爾喀拉（Alcala）去。如果你質問他們，他們會驕傲地對你說他們是個人主義者。閒散的人們，仍舊跟從前一樣，從早到夜坐在咖啡店裏。他們談論着政治，有氣無力地閉着眼睛任擦靴者擦刷他們光亮無瑕的皮鞋。高貴的布爾喬亞可以從俱樂部的窗口望見。老婦們仍舊在教堂的甬道上擁擠着。盛裝艷服的少婦吻着肥碩的主教的手。修道士在「沙龍」中喝着酒並且摸着女人的屁股</p>
<p>在聖誕節的幾天中，的有十來個盛教的「聖母」，在塞維爾的街上行進着。快車把虔誠的卡白拉魯黨徒們從瑪德里帶了來，他們一到旅館，就脫去他們世俗的衣裳，而穿上「懺悔的基督教徒」的服裝。雖然選舉有了新的結果，聖母今年還是得到了一頂簇新的祭壇上的華蓋——是瑪德里婦女們的貢物，她們每月捐助二鎊的銀子。</p>
<p>在自山報（El　Liberal）的第一頁上，誰都可以讀到關於「工人的高尙道德」等的文章，但在最後一頁上却有十幾則廣告這樣寫着：「卡白勃魯的同志們：別忘記了到麗太夫人的沙龍去。美麗的少女哪，金色的，黑色的。還有外國的女郞」。</p>
<p>同樣的摩天樓，同樣的茅屋，同樣的貧窮。農夫們仍舊使用着歷史以前的犂耙。女郞們的頭上頂着很重很重的水壺。工人喝着淸水一樣的湯，而農人郤連這也只能夢想着。街上的孩子們都是襤褸赤足而且被遺忘了的，要進一個學校比中彩票還難—實在因為孩子太多而學校太少。生活是艱苦而殘酷的，像卡斯的里平原上的岩石一樣……</p>
<p>同樣的三角帽。像哥雅（Goyu）所畫的「恐怖」一樣他們在陋巷中間，在橄欖樹中間，在孩子們中間溜躂着。他們使人想起了愛斯脫拉瑪杜拉（Etramaoura）田野中的槍斃，想起了露身的屍體，想起了啼哭的女人，想起了飢餓的孩子……</p>
<p>在塞哥維亞，法西斯蒂者高聲呌喊着：「打倒阿柴那，醒來，西班牙！」工人想分散法西斯蒂者。內衛團開始向工人槍擊。那戴三角帽的殺手那裏管得現在西班牙的總理是阿柴那了？他們只知道一件事：槍口只向工人，而不向可敬的卡白勃魯的弟兄們。四月十四日，內衛團一個軍官想謀刺阿柴那。這個目的未遂的兇手是在混戰中被槍殺了。在他的葬儀中，內衛團的軍官們一壁走一壁喊着口號：「內衛團萬歲！」</p>
<p>總統是換了，但總統的衛隊長勃脫（Batet）——他就是「平靖」一九三四年十月喀泰龍納之亂的——郤並沒有撤職。警察仍然保藏着「叛徒」的名單。在那污損的破舊的卡片上，那般曾經反叛帝制反叛勒樂和盧勃爾斯政府人們的名字都記錄着。卡片上有幾個名字，都巳是現在的部長了，但在警察的心目中，依然認為是危險的「叛徒」呢。</p>
<p>巴塞龍納發生了冶金工人的罷工。警察搜香職工會，有八十個工人被拘逮了。加泰隆的政府很為難；便呌警察把工人釋放。警察很不願意地照辦了。但過不幾天，他們又去搜查職工會拘了一百二十個人。</p>
<p>怎樣來解繹這神行動呢？這不復是政治上的問題，而只是簡單的條件反射——對於舊習慣的忠誠。</p>
<p>當今巴塞能納一個高級的官吏，曾經一時　屬於里維拉將軍法西斯組織的「愛國同盟」（Union　Patriotica）。這個組織常以為首的U.P.二字作為本身的簽名。但在今日，巴塞龍納房屋的牆上却塗着U.H.P.三個字母——意思就是“Unions　Hermonos　Proletarios”（無產兄弟聯盟，道是阿斯杜里亞革命者的口號。）最近有一個諷刺雜誌借此譏嘲他。寫的是他面對着途有“U.H.P.三個字母的牆壁說：「奇怪，在我當初的時候，這中間是沒有“H”這個字的。」什誌是被沒收了，因此道個高級官吏得無損於「令名」。</p>
<p>在瑪德里，那般會經襲擊過社會黨領袖卡白勃魯寓邸的法西斯主義者都受着審訊。他們被判處五個到五十個「披斯脫」（Pesta西幣名）的罰金。這同一的法庭也曾經審訊過社會主義者斐妥（Solero　Feito）。斐妥並不曾襲擊過任何人；他只是犯了携帶手槍的罪。然而他却被判了四年的監禁。</p>
<p>同一的法律，同一的法官，同一的獄卒。然而西班牙巳不復是同一的了。</p>

<p>所得稅將開征</p>
<p>中央財政、上年度因走私猖獗、關稅短收甚鉅、歲出則增加一萬萬餘元、不敷達二萬萬餘元、此卽財政收支不平衡之差額、幸本開源節流之原則、竭力維持、並整理稅收、節省各項經費、而得安渡難關、本年度則期於兩廣統一告成、國家信用、更臻鞏固、走私則賴於海關努力之查緝、人民之協助、其勢漸戢、稅收損失較少、並於不妨碍農工商業發展之原則、仿各國先例、預備開征所得稅、卽將於十月一日起、先自公務人員薪給報酬之所得、及公債與存欵　利息之所得開征、此種直接稅收、有利於國、而無害於民、苟能辦理得當、卽成為各種稅收之中心、故此後財政收支、稍假時日、定可因新稅之收效、而趨於平衡、卽入民對國家納稅之義務、亦可平均、蓋所得稅係征諸有利益之人、逈非從前之厘金雜稅可比、此卽政府顧念民生、不以增加捐稅、而重人民負担之苦心、已為人民所共見也、</p>
<p>整理粵省財政</p>
<p>整理粵省財政、自鄒次長朱兼廳長赴粵後、卽秉承中央所定方針、首重改革幣制、使與全國之幣制統一、以前粵當局不遵中央法令、濫發亳券、以遂私利、發行總額、竟達二萬四千　九百餘萬元之鉅、現金準備、約僅百分之四十三、充作保護準備之省庫券九千二百萬元、其基金又不確實、故中央為安定市面、體恤粵民、特决定發行粵省　金融公債一萬二千萬元、以補足現金準備項下　所短少百分之十七、及四成保證準備、以符法定、而地方財政方面、則實行禁賭、並裁减苛捐雜稅、以蘇民困、支出部份、以節流為主、凡非急要之需、均加節制、現正飭由粵財廳重編廿五年度省預算、呈部核定施行、至中央銀行籌設粵分行事、經派該行國庫局副局長李惕生·及業務局副局長周守良、前住調查實際情形、已返滬報告、現已派定　中央銀行漢口分行鍾經理、卽日赴粵籌設、至廣西方面、是否有單獨設立分行之必要、當俟粵分行成立後、視實際需要再定、</p>
<p>各地農產豐稔</p>
<p>嗣後孔氏對今歲各地農產豐稔、表示欣慰、惟於如何始可免除穀賤傷農一節、尤深致注意、據談、今歲農產之豐收、雖由於天助、然亦半由人力、蓋年來各省水利之興修、墾植面積之拓展、種植技術之改進、此種工作之勇力、均為增加生產之源、故希望全國人民、切不以此豐稔之年歲為可喜、宜切實注意更如何努力、以增加生產、因我國統計可耕之地、不下四十萬萬畝、而現用以耕種者不過十五萬萬畝、切盼人民、除已耕之地、應設法盡力改良、增加生產外、墾植荒地、亦應積極祐展、務使全國民食足以自給、而其尤要者、厥為積存穀米、及調劑盈虛、亟應實行常平倉制度、積穀防荒、並酌察需要、調節民食、庶榖價不因豐年而低落、農民轉受其害、現在內部正在籌劃、想卽可見諸實施、</p>
<p>全國金融安定</p>
<p>全國金融自受世界經濟恐慌之影響、前昨兩載中、因農村之破產、工商業停滯、內地金融緊縮、資金均集中於都市、頗有使全國金融　而若人體之血液不得流通、故整個金融之危迫、幾達極點、迨去歲經政府　毅然改革幣制、實施法幣政策、一方令由中央　中國交通三大銀行、低利拆放鉅欵、辦理承兌匯票貼現、調劑工商業之經濟、一方平衡外匯、節制資金外流、進而穩定債市、杜絕投機、並督促銀行投資農村、以調劑農民經濟、數月來法幣行施、旣因現金準備充足、信用亦日益鞏固、故綜觀今歲以來、上海與各地匯兌之頻繁、拆息之平衡、在在足以顯示金融情形之安定、此實使吾人引為欣慰者也云、</p>

<h3>本年第二季　上海工商業異動報吿　（續）　B六月份重要工商行家之異動</h3>
<p>— （上海工商業概況之三十五）　中國微信報主編</p>
<p>乙，製造工業方面</p>
<p>一，信利駝絨廠正式淸算該廠設立於民國二十年七月，資本總額為一萬四千元，係合夥性質，由股東黃品良君兼任經理，儸有工人四十餘人，置備織機四架，每日可產駝絨五百碼。本年一月間該廠因股東意見不合，一部分股東甚至提取存貨生財而去，以致被逼停工，迄今猶未解决，該廠經理以長此停頓，損失浩大，故正式宣吿淸理。</p>
<p>二，同成漂染拉毛棉織廠淸理召盤該廠創業於民國二十三年九月，資本實額為五萬元，係合夥組織，經理由股東宋友生君兼任，僱有職工七十餘人，共有針織機—餘架，分棉織，漂染，拉絨，整理四部。年來因市面不振，同業問均貶價傾銷，該廠營業因此頗受虧折，延至本月六日終因無法維持，宣吿淸理，並　廠基生財機器等召盤。</p>
<p>三，晋昌祥機器廠停業該廠始創於民國十年前後，資本無定額，由張遴祥君等合資創辦，僱有工人六十餘人，備有大小車床二十部，專以製造柴油引擎為主。近年來因各業衰落，機器之需要隨之减退，營業遂逐步簫條，虧蝕不貲，雖經張君竭力縮小範圍，而仍大不敷出，故經各股東議决停業。</p>
<p>四，利昌機器廠淸理召盤該廠為羅錦如君獨資創立，專造織襪機器；平日營業，堪稱發達，然近三年來因受不景氣影響，營業頓吿遜色，卽圖勉力維持，事實上亦不可得，不得已乃於十一日宣吿淸理，並將機器生財召盤。</p>
<p>五，協昌坡璃廠維記公司淸理該廠為粵商鄧仲澤君等所創，係股份有限公司性質，自建廠房於閘北胡家木橋一六三弄，頗具規模，由鄧君自兼經理，專製玻璃器具；過去營業，成績殊佳，旋因受滬戰影響，全部幾瀕破產，幸經主持者應付得力，卒與債權人商妥以債權充作股份，加維記以繼續生產；詎料復業甫始，不景氣又籠罩全國，營業一落千丈，前途頓具悲觀；鄧君不得已乃與各股東商妥將玻璃部份停止生產，改營賽璐珞玩具器皿等物，轉變生產以後，營業仍未起色，而該廠　棧又忽於二十四年五月二十六日失愼，廠房三問及所有存貨，悉燬於火，損失達三萬餘元，處此重重打擊，維持實感困難，至本月二十五日乃吿淸理。</p>
<p>六，麗華興整染廠，中興印花廠與競新精煉工廠三家閉歇，前兩家均調受不量氣影響，無法維持，競新精煉工廠始本年四月五日開幕，總經理為潘文彬君，專以精煉，漂白，整理為業矜；詎營業未屆兩月，卽因潘君辭職，廠中負責無人，而吿淸理。近來漂染業因受絲織業之極度衰落而招致之危機，固已顯而易見矣。</p>
<p>七，泰豐餅乾糖果罐頭食品公司復業　該公司自於二十三年十二月間因受華明火柴公司之牽累宣吿淸理後，卽經公司當局呈請法院召集債權會議通過和解方案，並由董事會另招優先股二十萬元，積極籌備，於本月九日賡續營業。</p>
<p>八，中國標準牛奶豆乳公司宣吿淸理拍賣該公司於民國二十三年開始籌備，翌年二月始告成立。資本額定為國幣五十萬元，董事兼經理為英國人H.W.Howele君，開業以來，營業殊淸，雖曾發行公司債萬五千元以圖挽救，然終亦毫無起色。本年春季該公司債券人為顧全利益計，共組委員會以管理該公司營業，公推陳幼靑先生主持一切，並將豆乳部停辦，但因一部份股東另向英國法庭起訴，當經判决將全部資產出賣，所有債務槪由原卞淸理。丙，販賣商方面</p>
<p>一，上海復興國貨公司之停業該公司方於四月一日宜吿復業，迄今不過二月，突謂房屋恐有危險，暫時停止營業。</p>
<p>二，吳榮泰花粉洋廣貨號淸理召盤該公司開設迄今，業已三十餘載，係吳成章先生獨資創辦，專售香粉百貨等物。該號初時係轎行，光緒二十四年改營鞋業，民國元年始營現業。歷年營業均有盈餘，然年來因不景氣之故，屢吿虧蝕，三十餘年之老店，竟亦於本月廿一日宣吿淸理召盤矣。（完）</p>

<h3>中央大學之　最近四年（一）</h3>
<p>— 羅家倫</p>
<p>國立中央大學位處首都、其最近內部設置進展之狀况、想為國人所注意、家倫於二十一年九月五日就職整理、於二十三年六月曾發表一簡單報吿、名目『兩年來之中央大事』、其實該篇所叙述者、名為兩年、實則十九閱月中之事實、時光荏苒、忽又兩年、茲復重行檢討、綜覈過去四年中之事實、扼要臚陳、共中小部分尙仍舊載、大部分均屬新增、一以客觀之現象與可稽之數字為衡、而不涉論斷、更無有於鋪張、更名曰『中央大學之最近四年』、以供關心大學敎育者之參考、至於改進過程中之缺陷、自必甚多、尙乞社會賢達隨時予以指導及敎正、猶憶家倫奉命之時、嘗曰、欲謀中央大學之重造、必循『安定』『充實』『發展』三時期以進、茲差幸安定充實、業見效功、本年以來、發展之現象、亦有事實以為證明、惟根基初樹、艱鉅在前、非得全國人士之協力維護與賢明政府之繼續指尊及扶持、斷難畢竟全功、苟能叨國家安定繁榮之幸、則數年之後、中央大學當努力自期於無負於復興民族事業之一部分也、茲陳梗槪、以候敎益、</p>
<p>一、院系之整理</p>
<p>本校原有文理法敎工農醫商等八學院、文理等六學院設於首都、醫商兩學院設於上海、二十一年本校奉令改組、經行政院决定、將在滬之醫商兩學院獨立、本校遂存在京之六學院、家倫到校後、覺六院中系科設置、仍有整理之必要、乃斟酌整理委員會之决議、及國家社會之需要、將繁複之敎育社會系等、從事歸併、而將較切國家實際需要之學系、如工學院之化學工程系農學院之園藝系、予以恢復、計整理結果、尙分六院三十系科、至以後添設之醫學院、牙醫專科學校、及機械特別硏究班不計焉、文學院分中國文學系、外國文學系、哲學系、史學系、社會學系五系、理學院分算學系、物理學系、化學系、地質學系、地理學系、生物學系六系、法學院分法律學系、政治學系、經濟學系三系、敎育學院分敎育學系、心理學系一系、藝術科、體育科、衛生敎育科三科、工學院分土木工程系、機械工程系、電機工程系、建築工程系、化學工程系五系、農學院分農藝系、森林系、畜牧獸醫系、農業化學系、園藝系、蠶桑系六系、此係自二十一年度至二十四年度之情形也、至二十五年則奉部令將社會及蠶桑兩系裁併、其一部分課程則併入他系開設、故前述六院、將為二十八系科所搆成、但醫學院所分科別、本處未及計入、又系科中有分組者、如藝術科分繪畫音樂兩組、此處亦不備列、</p>
<p>二、院校之添設及擴充　（一）添設醫學院</p>
<p>政府鑒於我國醫學人材至感缺乏、及國立醫學院之稀少、不能不在首都設立高等醫學敎育機關、特令本校添辦醫學院、本校亦深感醫學敎育對於民族健康及國防上之重要、於奉令後卽經積極進行、惟政府並未撥發特定經費、本校不得不於原有之經常費內盡力撙節、以供該院經常支出及設備之用、二十四年度開始招生正式成立、該院敎室實騐室建築、亦已落成、下年度新設備解剖學·生理學·生物化學·病理學·藥物學、及細菌學等六個實騐室、以供二年級敎學實騐之用、同時與衛生署及南京市政府合作、辦理衛生實騐診療所、地址卽在本校對面、一部分為本校校產、一部分為本校向榮德生先生捐膾之地基、計地產及新建築之價値、約計四五萬元、此項建築現已動工、將來該院學生、除在中央醫院實習外、並可隨時在該所實習、</p>
<p>（二）添設牙醫專科學校政府决定於二十四年度內設立一國立牙醫專科學校、以救濟國民最普週之齒牙病症、因本校設有醫學院、卽指定由本校主持辦理、本校自奉到主辦命令後、卽經積極進行、於去年暑假本校招生時、該校亦同時招生、正式成立、所有各項課程、除與本校文理醫等畢院取得密切連絡並由各該學院分担各種基本科目外、關於該校專門科目、均分別聘請專家担任、復於寒假期內添辦口腔衛生訓練班、以造就初級實用人員、備將來各中小學辦理口腔衛生之用、設備方面、該校成立一年以來、購置圖書館儀器模型器械費用、已近十四萬元、現正趕建牙醫院、計劃已定、卽日興工、落成後輔以購置之各種最新設備、將成為國內唯一最完備最新式之牙醫院、（未完）</p>

<h3>壓倒英國　美國得羅泊杯　高級單打柯拉沙得決賽權　表演賽林實華勝卡遜一盤</h3>
<p>網球國手邱飛海氏病逝海外之噩耗傳來後、中西人士、莫不同悼、尤以邱氏家屬、境况蕭條、更引起網球界之悲憫、自網球元老胡憲生氏提議舉行紀念賽後、西人草地協會及法商會等、更願共襄義舉、因此、盛大之邱飛海紀念賽、卽於昨日下午在法商會舉行、球迷以旣飽眼福、更屬義舉、來者踵接、東南西三看台、莫不滿座、約計當在千外、盛况不下於前日、結果高級單打、柯拉沙以三對一淘汰福勃斯得决賽權、將於本週末與卡遜决錦標、國際羅泊杯雙打、美國卡遜史規亞、竟以三對一擊敗全滬最佳之老搭擋德孚與朋納維區、榮膺錦標、實屬不易、最後林寳華卡適之特別表演、林勝第一盤後、第二盤以天晚未結束、茲分誌各悄如下、</p>
<p>高級單打複賽</p>
<p>柯拉沙輕　取福勃斯</p>
<p>本屆參加高級單打者、計共十三人、柯拉沙不勞而人第二週後、以直落三取勝印迪克生、福勃斯亦以牛皮糖之手段而獲複賽權、昨日兩人相遇、識者早知福勃斯之必敗、果然、柯拉沙起始卽以極爽脆之擊法、以六比〇、六比〇連勝兩盤、第三盤福勃斯曾予以猛烈之抵抗、兩人球藝、均屬牛皮糖型、相持多時、終被福勃斯以六比四扳回、第四盤亦相當精彩、但最勝利終歸柯拉沙、比數為六比三、總結果三對一、柯拉沙獲决賽權、定本週末與卡遜决奪錦標、</p>
<p>羅泊杯決賽</p>
<p>各獲一局　秋色平分</p>
<p>國際羅泊杯雙打、中華隊不幸於第一週卽遇勁旅美國隊、致遭淘汰、美國又戰勝法國而獲决賽權、上屆冠軍英國隊、本屆幸運輪空、出戰後又壓倒曾在第一週戰勝日本之葡萄牙隊、晋入决賽週、蓋以德孚朋納維區之雙打、稱雄全滬已久、論實力、卡遜與史規亞、遜色殊多、昨日英美决賽相逢於邱氏紀念賽中、事前錦標預測、以英國呼聲最高、交鋒後、德孚開球先攻、未見順利、美卽以二比〇前導、朋納維區開球、方扳回一局、旋美又以五比一領先、朋再以開球得勝、史規亞發球失利、英遂追成五比三、但不久卽被美以六比三結束第一盤、次盤自一比一至四比四、均各勝一局、但均美前導、亦均以開局、至第九局時卡遜開球、以雙失誤過多、失一滑局後、英遂以五比四超出、再勝一局後、卽以六比四扳回、成秋聲平分之勢、</p>
<p>急轉直下　美獲錦標</p>
<p>第三盤美仍以一比〇佔先、再以三比一前導、英方亦努力追隨、局勢至此、仍極平均、自三比三平等後、美方急轉直下、連勝三局、以六比三結束第三盤、末盤更見激烈、英先獲一局後、美卽以三比一超出、旋各勝一局成四比二、仍美前導、此時更見短兵相接、雙方均上綱欗殺、精彩迭見、英國連獲兩局、又追成四比四平等、迨德孚開球、滿期如願、結果連以兩記邊綫球出界、大勢遂去、末局在三十對三十時、朋觸網自殺、德孚又遠飛界外、美遂以六比四獲收佳果、屆此數三對一、美國榮膺本總羅泊杯錦標、</p>
<h3>林實華勝卡遜</h3>
<p>實華於前日被卡遜擊敗於高級單打複賽中、昨在特別表演中重逢、更引人特殊之注意、卡遜方戰罷羅泊杯、餘勇猶覺可沽、未曾充分休息、卽登塲與林對壘、交鋒後、林氏發球先攻、仍以反手切進取、第一局林形勢極佳、但平等後、按連兩次上網、被卡遜所乘、遂反勝為敗第一局卡更以發球得一滑局、遂以二比〇前導、至此林更有極佳表現、更乘卡遜之雙失悮及野球、遂連勝三盤、以三比二超出、五比三後、卡竟追成平等、林氏沉着應戰、方以七比五獲勝第一盤、次盤卡又先獲一局、一比一後、卡再連勝二局、旋又各勝一局、四比二卡遜領先時、因天已垂暮、未曾結束、罷戰、综觀昨日寳華球藝、其正手抽仍軟弱無力、上網高壓、亦仍少見、惟反手抽尙稱完善、卽開球時之變失悮、當較卡遜减少三分之二也、</p>

<h3>吾國選手團隨征記　（第十二信）中央社特派員馮有眞寄</h3>
<p>（五）（四）籃球第二戰　勝法國入第二週</p>
<p>大會籃球比賽、規則採用雙循環制、參加的廿三國、於第一週第一日、分成十一組比賽、另有一隊輪空、得勝的十一隊、升入第二週、失敗的十一隊、第二日冉分組比賽、失敗淘汰、得勝者與第一日得勝者同樣升入第二週、另行抽簽排定比賽秩序、（如抽定的兩隊上週已經相遇、則第二名抽出、與下一組第一名抽出者對換、）這樣一步一步的淘汰下去、直到最後打剩六隊、再决定前六名名次、中國第一日旣被日本所敗、第二日與被愛斯蘭擊敗之法國相遇、勝敗為淘汰與否之關鍵、關係極為重大、結果我隊以四五比卅八獲勝、得與日本同樣升入第二週、稍洩第一日敗衂之寃氣、</p>
<p>歐洲各國的籃球、發剏未久、球藝都很幼稚、法國隊在歐洲各國中、尙算是佼佼者、可是無論個人的技術、以及全隊的合作、實在是平康得很、如果我們能出以鎭靜、發揮固有實力、比數相差至少在二十分以上、可是全隊隊員、第一日被日本慘敗後、神志隳喪、精神煥散、開塲後、竟被法國以十對二的巨差、遙遙占先、要不是大家在後來沉着應戰、也許第一週就被淘汰、那才是極大的笑話、</p>
<p>上塲發暈法國領先</p>
<p>比賽原定下午四個時開始、因兩隊服裝均為藍色、擲毫結果、由法國更換大會所備之紅色球衣、但號布未釘、現找別針、延至四時一刻方開始接觸、我隊閃出牟作雲王玉增王鴻斌李紹唐王南珍五員大將兩三盤旋、王南珍得球遠射、虎發兩彈、勞而無功、法國隊拚命亂上、亦徒費氣力、牟作雲百步穿楊、首先打開紀錄、法國隊時來運轉、右鋒乘隙而入、打成平手、此公似有球神附身、遠射近投、無不得心應手、頃刻問八對二遙遙占先、中國跳球、而中鋒雙雙犯規、馬馬虎虎大家都罰不進、法左鋒再在籃下建功、十比二殺得我頭暈眼花、王鴻斌罰球得分、法國隊照樣回敬、李紹唐兩罰不中、敵軍反遠中紅心、十三比二、更加不楚生意經</p>
<p>奮勇力戰追成平手</p>
<p>王隊長囑鞏固、前綫大肆活躍、王南珍妙濟械彈、王玉增不辱使命籃下一托、適穿網窩、王鴻斌罰球得分、後籃下又試身手、十三比八、漸漸追上、法國隊身强力壯、氣勢未衰、王南珍兩次失手、鑄成大錯、十七比八、又差九分、我隊急忙更換人馬、王士選出陣應戰、王南珍解甲歸田、陣綫煥然一新、聲勢突增、玉增三建奇功、士選作雲亦各叩敵籃、十八比十七、我隊超出、法右鋒遠射中的、王鴻斌亦還以顏色、二十比十九、仍勝一分、此時戰雲密布、殺氣騰騰、空氣十分緊張、興趣極為濃厚、法中鋒籃下射球、時李紹唐阻止犯規、兩分之外、再加一罰、法隊又以二十二比二十躍居上風、王鴻斌遠射不入、跟進命中、上半勝結果廿二比廿二打成平手、</p>
<p>否極泰來我佔上風</p>
<p>休息再戰、兩中鋒各為本隊建績、分數仍是相等、法國隊球運亨通、中鋒兩次意外收入、又以四分超出、我隊急以沈聿功替代、牟作雲小沈神出鬼沒、捉操不定、與兩王搭檔進迫、兩立汗馬功勞、鴻斌不失罰球、廿九比廿八、脫穎而出、此時合作純熟、否極泰來、三前鋒出沒敵陣、如入無人之境、兩後衛進攻退守、有條有理、三前鋒連中三元、卅五比廿八、巳領先七分、此時法國陣脚搖動、心慌意亂、籃後擲出界球、竟直穿對塲、祇憑蠻力、觀衆為之捧腹、</p>
<p>奇兵突出完成勝利</p>
<p>然法國隊心高氣傲、不甘屈服、整飭隊伍、兩調生力軍、果然氣派十足、扳回兩分、王士選罰球得分後、新右鋒居然一擲一罰、彈無虛發、三十六比三十三、漸漸接近、旋成卅七比卅五、祇差二球、王鴻斌三失良機、後兩贖前愆、奠定大局、法國隊血戰肉搏、又追成四十一比三十八、王隊長看看時間將到、下令穩紮穩打、球在中綫傳來傳去、總不前進、直急得法國暴跳如雷、拚命搶奪、可是陣綫一亂後防空虛、小沈大王、雖準空隙、奇兵突出、籃下兩施妙計、嗚余收軍、四十五比三十八、我隊勝利、</p>

<p>（五）（五）籃球意外受挫三戰敗于秘魯</p>
<p>籃球賽第一週第二戰、旣勝法國、升入第二週、遂於九日下午五時、與秘魯作第二週的第一戰、中秘兩隊、曾於七月廿九日作一度友誼賽、結果我隊以四十三對卅六大勝、所以八日下午抽簽决定與秘魯相遇時、大家都一團高興、以為可以安安穩穩的升入第三週、可是四十分鐘劇戰之下、我隊竟以廿一比廿九受挫、眞是大出意料之外、</p>
<p>秘魯的球藝、確確實實、並不高明、我隊受挫的原因、不是由于秘魯打得好、而是由于自己打得太壞、自第一戰被日本慘收後、全隊隊員好像當頭被人一棒、精神渙散、意志消沈、第二戰遇法國、雖全力奮戰、最後獲勝、可是隊員的體力、已極為疲倦、第三日再與秘魯作戰、巳成强弩之末、力不從心、投籃罰球、旣毫無把握、運球傳球、亦錯誤百出、在這種情况之下、秘魯雖弱、我隊亦祇能低首被擒了、</p>
<p>精神渙散初受小挫</p>
<p>下午五時、開始比賽、我隊以王鴻斌沈聿功王玉增李紹唐王南珍五將應戰、中圈跳球、我隊採取攻勢、沈聿功遠射不中、王鴻斌亦一再無的放矢王中軍前進被阻、傳于王鴻斌、鴻斌不辱使命、雙手遠射打開紀錄、秘魯中鋒、不甘示弱、亦遠射回敬、二比二打成平平、玉增體態失常、屢發不中、小沈欄下放砲、球從籃圈一轉又復跳出、命運不濟、巳伏敗績預兆、反之敵軍一發中的、反以四比二超出、玉增勉力打成平平、敵軍左鋒、又罰球取分、小沈奮不顧身、直過敵營籃下、右手一揚、六比五又吿領先、敵軍率師反攻、中軍三擲一罰、十二比六分數相差一倍、此時我軍精神渙散、陣錢零亂、小沈牲犧兩次罰球後、籃下再試身手、扳回兩分、秘魯左鋒活潑伶俐、無孔不入、兩記過山砲、又打成十六比八、王鴻斌于千辛萬苦中、奪回一球、上半時十六比十我受小挫、</p>
<p>力不從心終于敗績</p>
<p>吃過、整軍再戰、玉增體力不濟、奔跑吃力、小沈求勝心切、亦行動慌張、我軍急行整飭隊伍、玉增下野、南珍加入前綫、馮念華出任左鋒、王士選鎭守後方、秘魯左鋒、籃下建績、李紹　罰球初度命中、此時敵軍氣勢汹汹、大舉進攻、連中三球、我隊始由鴻斌罰得一分、廿二比十二、形勢益非、秘魯左鋒遠射、再度命中、中鋒亦發球不失、廿五比十二勝局已定、我軍拚命反攻、無如力不從心、李紹唐擲中一球、秘魯右鋒立刻勾消、廿七比十四、仍差十三分、南珍罰球得分後、小馮兩破敵籃、追上五分、正擬發奮圖强、然秘魯右鋒一記遠射、給以莫大打擊、南珍雖扳回兩分、但時間已到、廿九比廿一我軍敗績、</p>

<h3>世界經濟復興的透視</h3>
<p>— 陶更生</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>自從世界經濟恐慌達到了一九三二年的頂點以後，近年又漸漸在週期性的經濟規律當中恢復起來了，這種趨勢發展到最近為止，表現得十分顯著。</p>
<p>去年九月以前，世界經濟的復興，重心在工業生產與物價的回昇，而世界貿易則並無好轉之象，這在經濟供求的關係上，顯出十分重大的矛盾，而成為復興前途的暗礁。但自去年九月到本年五月為止，工業生產與物價固繼續有顯著的進步，而世界貿易的轉機，尤為經濟復興加入新的證據。</p>
<p>根據最近統計，本年五月份世界主要各國的工業生，指數為九七·一，（註一）已達到六年來的最高紀録，物價指數為七三·一，（註二）已達到四年來的最高紀録，比去年全年平均，都要高出很多。</p>
<p>世界貿易的上昇，是最近的事實，上昇的程度又很和緩，根據國聯統計月報，本年五月份世界七十五國的貿易額指數為三六·五，比去年全年的平均指數三四·八，計增加一·七，比基期一九二九年尙相差甚遠，僅及其百分之三六·五，不過，就這一點輕微的上漲，也是很可注意的。</p>
<p>因為在現代各國劇烈的關稅戰爭與貨幣戰爭底下，世界貿易受着無數鎖鍊的束縛，而貿易總額還能增進，這就顯示出各國國內的工業生產情形，是何等的猛進。</p>
<p>然則各國的工業生產何以能够猛進？物價何以能够上昇？世界貿易何以有輕微的轉機呢？這裏，我們應該指出一個重要的因素，那便是各國的軍備擴張與貨幣政策。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>自從一九三三年以來，世界各國軍費的龐大，在歷史上除了歐戰期間以外，是沒有一個時期可以和現在相比擬的。尤其在意阿戰爭與德國萊茵駐軍以後，各國一致重振軍備，其軍擴的程度與緊張的局面，比之歐戰爆發前，要勝過許多。我們且舉出幾個重要國家的軍費額，就可以窺見一斑了。本年度俄國的軍事預算為五萬九千萬鎊，比去年增加一倍以上，英國為一萬八千萬鎊，美國為二萬四千萬鎊，日本為十萬六千萬日元，而根據日本寺內陸相的提案，還要建立二十萬萬日元的國防强化計劃。拿這些數字來和歐戰前期相比擬，將使人如何地驚駭呢！</p>
<p>軍費的無限制擴張，一方面表示出戰爭的必難避免，一方面刺激了工業生產的發展，和隨與俱來的物價回昇。祗要看，各國的工業生產和物價的上昇時期，大致和軍備擴張的上昇時期相同；同時，再看近年工業生產進步的內容，完全以重工業為中心，尤其是軍需工業增加最速，輕工業簡實沒有進步。所以，現代各國的工業生產儘管日益發達，而對於一般人民的生活，却有損無益。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>第二個造成經濟復興的主要因素是各國的貨幣貶値政策。自從一九三一年英國停止金本位以後，各國相繼效尤，演出普遍的貨幣貶値競爭，因為貨幣貶値對內可以提高物價，活潑金融，對外可以壓低匯價增加輸出貿易，結果，使國內的工業生產事業日見進步。不過，工業生產的上昇，還祗受着貨幣貶値政策的間接影響；而物價的上昇，則是貨幣貶値的直接效果。因為貨幣的價値貶低，則以貨幣為計算標準的物價便漲起了。假如我們把貨幣貶値的因素剔除，而依各國貨幣所含純金量為標準以計算物價，則近年物價的趨勢，除了最近有輕微的轉機以外，下跌甚劇，看下面兩種計算方法的物價指數，便可明白。</p>
<p>一九二九年　一九三二年　一九三五年　一九三六年五月份</p>
<p>依金價計算之物價指數（註三）　一〇〇·〇　六一·〇　五二·二　五三·三依各國貨幣計算之物價指數（註四）　一〇〇·〇　六八·七　七一·六　七三·一</p>
<p>貨幣政策對於生產，物價，貿易，以及其他各種經濟現象的影響旣十分重大，所以在討論貨幣政策與世界經濟的關係之時，應該把貨幣貶値國家和金本位國家分開來觀察，</p>
<p>到現在為止，世界上大多數國家俱已停止金本位實行貨幣貶値，剩下的眞正保持金本位的國家，祇有法·荷·瑞士三國。前面所說，世界經濟渡過了一九三二年危機的深淵以後，一九三三年起開始向上發展。這是一句概括的話，是限於大多數的貨幣貶値國家而言，尤其是取得貨幣上優勢的英·美·日諸國。</p>
<p>至於法國所領導的金本位集團，恰好作了貨幣貶値國經濟復興的犧牲者。無論在生產，物價，貿易，以及失業人數各方面都呈急遽下落之勢，經濟危機日深，有「伊於胡底」之嘆。因此比利時在去年三月毅然放棄金本位，德·意·兩國則在統制貿易與統制匯兌的政策之下，為變相的放棄金本位。所以過去一年間，比德·意·三國在生產，物價，貿易各方面都要比較的好轉，而法·荷·瑞士三國則仍一致的衰落。金本位國經濟情形的惡化，發展到今年，法郎恐慌，首先在政治風潮的導火綫下爆發出來了，先以萊茵事件，繼以左派勝利，最後以蔓延全國的工潮，每一次都引起嚴重的法郞恐慌。法郞恐慌，就是法國經濟破產的證明，而法郞如果竟至不能維持，則更是法國經濟破產到最後階段的證明，因為金本位在法國是被視為國家的第二生命的。</p>
<p>現在法郞雖仍勉强維持，而法郞金本位的精神已漸次喪失，漸次步德意之後塵，實行限制外滙，並管理人民在海外的資金。此外，瑞士亦於本年六月二十二日公布外匯限制令。可是，限制外滙與管理資金，是依舊不足以解决全本位國的經濟危難的。法國最近的生產，物價，雖在經濟轉張政策下有了進步，而貿易入超反見增加。所以法，荷，瑞士，最後仍將出於停止金本位之途徑。一旦全世界各國停止金本位後，原來藉貨幣政策以刺激經濟復興的因素便消失了。</p>
<p>現在，我們可以明白世界經濟復興的因素是何等的脆弱了。這些因素中間，或者蘊藏着極大的危機，把現代世界經濟推向毀滅的道路，如軍擴競爭，或者已逐漸消失刺激經濟復興的效能，如貨幣貶値政策。因而建築在這些因素上面的經濟復興，也就難於持久，而一時世界貿易的上昇，更不足樂觀。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>不僅在經濟復興的原因裏，看出世界經濟的根本缺陷來，而且從各國的財政與民生狀况中，更可以反映出世界經濟的底蘊來。</p>
<p>日，德，意，是現代的一等國家，去年的經濟如生產，物價，都有進步，而一方面人民生活的艱苦狀况，又是一天天加緊的。墨索里尼和希脫拉呌人民餓着肚子去爭取榮譽，食料品在德，意，是常常有缺乏之虞的，其他享受更不用說了。</p>
<p>美國是現代最富的國家，而失業問題依然很嚴重的，本年五月的失業人數為一千一百萬人，比去年底並無减少。此外，失業問題在英，日，法，荷，奧，都是很嚴重的，祇有德國，最近比較的減輕些。</p>
<p>嚴重的失業問題反映出民生的一方面，而與民生有密切關聯的各國財政狀况，更將予吾人以明確的啟示。</p>
<p>現代各國在軍擴競爭的環境底下，預算龐大，租稅苛重，人民不勝負担已成為各國一致的呼聲，世界的火藥庫如德，意，日，金本位國如法，荷，瑞士，固不必論，卽如美國人民，也在不斷發出咀咒的論調了，尤其在最近的旱災以後。</p>
<p>本年度主要各國的預算案中，稅收大致都增加了，而預算的不敷額則反見增大，依然要依賴赤字公價來彌補。赤字公債，又直接或間接，取之於一般人民，人民生活如何能增進呢？</p>
<p>財政的虧缺與赤字公債的龐大，最嚴重的當推金本位國與侵略國家。金本位國的中心為法國，它的公債額在去年一年閒增加一百八十萬萬法郞，公債總額達三千四百萬萬法郞，本年度在新政府的經濟擴張政策下，財政的虧缺與赤字公債的增發，更可想像而得。據八月八日倫敦電訊，僅在最近兩月之間，法國財政開支已在本年度預算不敷項下，增加十一萬萬法郞，同時財政部又發行了十萬萬法郞的小額短期信用債券，小額債券的發行，推銷得還順利，政府因此引為財政轉佳的憑證，其實，這裏巳經透露出極大的破綻了。法蘭西銀行以及巴黎其他商業銀行已不能再消容巨額債劵，而政府不得不轉向一般人民直接推銷。</p>
<p>侵略國家的德國，它的公債額成為一個疑點。各方面發表的數字並不相同，根據柏林景氣研究所統計，德國到去年底止的公債總額為三百零八萬萬馬克。</p>
<p>意大利在去年的公債額為六百十萬萬里拉，政府因對阿用兵，軍費緊急，財政困難，不勝負担公債利息，所以又發行了七百萬萬里拉的低利新公債，以掉換舊公債，同時，意大利銀行的存金，已快要流盡了。</p>
<p>日本的公債額到本年三月，已經快近一百萬萬日元，而軍部還主張採取龐大的公債政策以應付軍費。據八月二十四日東京電訊，日本明年度的預算概算將達三十二萬萬日元，是為日本財政史上的最高膨脹紀錄。</p>
<p>此外，美國的公債額到本年六月為止，也增加到美金三百四十四萬萬元，還有二百萬萬元的州公債與地方公債未包括在內，同時預算不敷額山去年的三十五萬七千五百萬元增加到本年的六十萬萬元，不過以美國的國富，人口，與人民負担力而論，美國財政還不致像法，德，意，日，諸國的達於山窮水盡之境。</p>
<p>各國之中，財政狀况比較最佳的當推英國。公債額據官方統計，已由去年底的七十八萬萬英鎊减為今年二月的七十七萬四千四百萬英鎊，過去一年，英國在主要各國中，是准一的財政收支盈餘者，英國頗引以自傲。但自今年重振軍備後，預算已不復能平衡了，計預算不敷額達一二，二九一百萬英鎊，完全為軍費擴張所致。</p>
<p>總合起來說，各國的財政與人民生活狀况，正與經濟復典背道而馳。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>除了各國的財政與人民生活狀況，日趨危難以外，全世界的弱小民族都作了強國的犧牲者，阿比西尼亞是最近一個顯明的例子，其他進行着深刻的慢性的榨取者，更不可勝計。可是對弱小民族的榨取，不僅會引起國際間的面突，而且也有個榨取乾了的日子，意國並不能因得到阿比西尼亞而經濟得以昭蘇。所以，世界經濟並沒有透出光明的境界，而世界經濟恐慌的　結依舊存在，——供求之間的鴻溝，無法可以消除。</p>
<p>這裏，我們應該注意到一個重要的新興國家。蘇聯經濟顯然優於世界其他各國。自從兩次五年計劃實行以來，蘇聯工業生產進步的速度，要超過其他各國四倍以上，列如下表：</p>
<p>一九二八年　　一九三六年　一九三六年　二月　五月</p>
<p>主各國的工業生·指數（註五）　一〇〇·〇　九一·七　九七·二</p>
<p>蘇聯工業生產指數（註六）　一〇〇·〇　四四三·二　——</p>
<p>並且，蘇聯工業生產的內容，是重工業與輕工業同時並進的。</p>
<p>世界各國都焦慮著生產過剩問題與失業問題的無法解決，而在蘇聯則並無這些問題存在。</p>

<h3>經濟建設之着眼點</h3>
<p>— 程尚林</p>
<p>—與重工業建設之可能性…並向讀者釋疑</p>
<p>已經、舊話重提了，關於中國經濟建設著眼點的討論。在過去，關於經濟建設時原則的確定，計分下列幾派不同的意見。甲：重工。乙：重農。丙：重商：丁：工農並重。這幾派，除了重商的一派主張根本不能成立，因為商品若非工業品卽係農業品，重商實等於重工或重農。二則所謂經濟建設，當然是充實生產。而商業僅係交換分配消費中購買關係的搆成而巳，並不能和發展生產作直接的連繫，宜乎和之者寡。除此以外，尙有工農並重者，乃係重工或重農兩派意見的調和折衷。這派主張和之者多，但已喪失了『偏重』兩字的原有意義。至若重工或重農者，其態度的認眞頗可欽佩，但細心考慮之後，終有他們偏於理論忽略實際的缺陷。甲：每一用具，他的搆成是複雜萬分的，譬如棉紗，在佈種時為農，在織造時為工，實非單純的某一部門生產卽可以完成的。乙：世界上沒有絕對的工業國或農業國，英日兩島國人多明白他是不適宜耕稼的。但是他們並不會忽略農業問題的重要。日本對於北海道方面的農作改良，和對於朝鮮台灣等處耕作保護的週密和監視的嚴格，英國對於印度農作的注重，以及其愛爾蘭本部農作的推進，正都可以說明不曾忽略了農業，而且是以殖民地來補救其天然的農業地理的缺陷。反之，美俄兩國，該可以說是農業國了。但他們對於重工業的推進，現在兩國都居然後來居上。丙：就中國而論，農業為安定民生的根本問題，工業為立國安邦的必要措置，兩者都重要萬分，宜乎工農並重論和之者多。除此以外，時賢更有提倡其他中張的。如李權時先生新近在經濟學季刋七卷一期所發表的文中，卽主張工農漁並重。這較之工農並重的主張，可以說更進一步了。但實質的說，重工或重農，以工立國或以農立國，雖不免於偏激或缺陷，終可以說得通。若云以漁立國，那就不知所謂了。——蓋中國沿海口岸僅有七省。因之所謂漁民者，原不過山於地理環境的天賦，而不得不從事的一種附業耳。諺所謂『靠山吃山，靠水吃水』者是。其救濟對策僅係（一）如何鞏固海防，禁止外艦在中國領海捕魚的主權問題。（二）如何增加航海安寗，以保障漁民的生命使不致時受意外犧牲的科學捕漁方法而已。除此而外，若以為漁業必須和工農業同樣並重之，那就未免小題大做了。而更進一步言之，漁業固不在工農兩者包括範圍之內，而鹽業，畜牧，也不在工農兩者包括範圍之內。就中鹽業，其重要更超過漁業。——設一旦發生非常事變，海鹽無從提製，全國均有淡食之虞。其危險也超過　　漁業。這未一來，就成為工農漁鹽畜牧，　重將原始時代的部落社會的漁獵經濟階段，以致於現在工業時代的資本主義經濟階段，同時而並重之，那眞蔚然大觀，然而這巳和『偏重』兩字的意義相反了。其實，平心論之，一個國家——特別是區域範圍如此其廣的中國，其經濟組織，本是複雜極端的，所謂偏重於任何生產一門，終不免令人見其幼稚缺陷。這裏，我才提出一個原則。卽非偏重於任何一門的科學生產方法問題。經濟建設的着眼點，原就如此。</p>
<p>然而所謂科學生產方法問題，並非空洞的人事改良，新思想的宣傳鼓吹而已，其實際進行，常然有賴於代替人力的重工業機器的支持。蓋（一）在農業部份，用科學方法集團耕稼，這是有賴重工業機器的引水，佈種，甚至搗米運送，都非機器不可。（二）在工業方面，輕工業的製造，非重工業的機器不行。而動力工業如煤，石油，金屬工業如鋼鐵等等開發，也非有賴於重工業的機械着手不可。更就重工業的機械本身而論，若果認為由外國入口終非根本之圖，那末機械的製造，也須有賴於機械的本身發動。（三）就漁業鹽業畜收而論，若探取科學生產方法，除部份的係技術改良（如畜牧等）以外，餘如科學捕魚，科學製鹽，則重工業的機器的用途也是萬能偉大的很。粽上所述，便可明白所謂科學生產方法問題，共中心問題，還是如何發展。『工業中的工業，』農漁鹽——或畜牧生產方法改造中的工業，使他成為一切生產原動力的重工業的機械問題。質言之，卽重工業的發展，才是一切生產力發展的原素。</p>
<p>重工業在生產落後的中國充實生產時所居地位的重要，為經濟建設之着眼點，旣如上述。然而，其發展的可能性又如何呢？</p>
<p>在這裏，應該明白有許多事，（如民族解放爭鬥的發動類）是『應不應和能不能』暫時相牽制，矛盾的對立着。而許多事（如重工業發展類）卽係應不應和能不能相聯繫的。——所剩餘者僅係辦不辦這一點而已。若無决心辦便以為不能辦，那不過是一種推托，遁詞。是不為也，非不能也！這是我們談經濟建設時所最不可忽略被朦飾麻醉的。茲且一一說明之。</p>
<p>許多的人，他們都不免犯上一種鉛誤的成見，他們以為重工業發展，在中國今日是人材物力財政都不堪勝任，一話，初聽之極有理山，細思之，却有不然。蓋（一）所謂人材者應該分兩面。一是勞動工人，二為工程技術人材。關於勞動工人點，在失業極度普遍的今日中國，當然不成問題。況乎中國勞工薪金低廉和刻苦精神之持久，是冠於世界，則國際的工業開發，其勞工人材借重於中國者也正小少。這已是不成問題了，而技術工程人材又如何呢？這問題還應該分作兩面。一是中國果眞的缺乏技術人材，那末未嘗不可以借重異邦。况乎各國失業人材，（這裏所謂失業者，乃係有工作技能而無勞動機會之謂，和中國社會普通的所謂失業者意義不同。）之多，正可以說明不愁楚材晋用人材之缺乏。况乎僱傭性質的借重友邦人材，當不須任何政治條約或背景，在機關中正不乏聘用外賓顧問的事實。而更言之，俄國社會革命當時，其國際方面的孤立較之中國今日更甚，尙能借重在當時是尖銳露骨對立的敵國——美國的失業工程技師人材，以作五年建設的帮助，中國現在難道就不能了嗎？二則所謂工程人材者雖然比較稀少，但並不能說沒有。不過不為社會所知，或不善於在現社會中處事，致多埋沒耳。地質學家不一定要算丁文江翁文灝，不過這兩位先生在社會上有地位有名望而巳！化學家也不一定要算吳蘊初范旭東，不過這兩位先生是成功者，在社會上打穩了基礎就是。中國社會風紀，在過往被不良政治牽連，每有學非所用，遭蹋人材不少。以此而曰中國人材缺乏，是不求其本，只逐其末。况乎人村須從實際中栽培的，不從事重工業建設着手而必待工程技術人材之產出，那無異杜源而　求水之暢流。烏乎可？（二）：所謂資本問題者，中國今日，政府財政困難是實事，民間資金較從前更見枯竭也是實事。然而，若以為重工業建設時的資本無着，那就是杞人憂天。首先，我們應該明白資本為水之就下，是向有利地帶跑的，過去，內地工業區之不能建立，礦不但不能發展。而且時受影饗，倒閉破產。這原因，除了內亂連年，外商機器捷足先登，足可推銷中國之外，那末其中民間資金，投資於都市房屋建築，投資於公債承銷。有較優良的利息，且有相當的保障，（如內國公債均有擔保，如房屋建築在都市——甚至租界，不因內戰影響，且反可因內戰而漲其價）。正是一個原因。在那個時候的社會風氣環境中，若言生產建設，重工業發展，自然不迎合國人的心理。而相反的，外人在那種變亂的　　社會中，一則因有其武力後援的條約保障，不憂愁因中國內戰而受任何損失。二則向中國作政治性重於商業性的經濟侵略的投資，（請注意這裏的「經濟侵略」四字的複雜性。）本是如水銀瀉地，無孔不入的。所以每內亂一次，中國航船惟恐被地方軍閥扣留，停止營業，外商輪船反可以乘此時機發展航運。中國礦商因內亂而停業，或因擔負地方公債軍需而破產，而外人投資的煤鐵礦商，反可乘此時機收買吞併國人自辦之礦山。（在此時國人以能脫售其礦權，收回血本為幸。）而一二機械工廠，其中人事的不善，科學人才的缺乏固然是一個原因。然而，大體上，實際上，由於資金的短絀，在官辦之下民間無從投資—且亦不願投資，致不能發展也未嘗不是一個原因。不能因為中國今日貧民之多借此藉口資金無着。試問，銀行資本這幾年來是不是因為過度膨脹（請看中國，交通，中央三行近數年的營業年報便知）而高唱資金歸農。試問中國的新興事業，凡有利潤可圖者其前途發展是不是方興未艾。（如近年來電影業的發達，中小銀行的增加，鐵路公債的暢銷。）而反面的說，中國的貧困正是重工業不曾發展，不能奠定工業的基礎是一個根本原因。（政治內戰除外）况乎礦業中『譬如陝北煤油礦在延長一帶分佈甚廣，一萬元左右便可開一新井。固然成敗沒有把握，但照以前的經騐十個井內總有三四個有成功的希望。但組織一個空洞的考慮團，一來便花去十來萬元，何如用這策欵來做一些實在的工作？如果要去再花幾十萬元，常然更不値得』（翁詠霓先生語，見以前的獨立評論四十期。）况乎中國輕工業的發展，由來至少也有三五十年，因為缺乏重工業奠定其基礎，所以到現在更形一蹶不振？況乎國人年來對於汽車機械飛機軍火之購買其代價所耗，足可建立幾個重工業廠而有餘。（請查民國以來的海關冊中重工業品入口的代價，和近數年船舶汽車入口的數目便知。）其次再談到政府財政了。政府今日，財政方面赤字累累是實事。但若以為重工廠的創辦，無此力量，必須和英商或德商訂立合同借欵之后方可，這話就未免是片面了。中國每逢內戰一次，兵費所耗，恐怕至少可以創辦十幾個重工業廠。北平一處，大學林立，敎費年耗三五百萬元，苟能合併而為一二大學，那末節省所得，也可以創辦二三工廠。（試問談高等敎育要緊，還是充實國力，經濟建設要緊。）其他例證，不勝枚舉，且亦不便。每人年薪一二萬元養多數終日淸間專坐外國入口汽車的人員，每人束脩年俸五六千元，養　　一班每週敎課三五小時，每班學生竟不能超過十人（對不住了老朋友，開罪於你，有禮了！）的所謂敎授，這些國欵若能緊縮節省，也可以作為重工廠中數千工人工資的經費了。豈是財政困難力不能立辦重工廠者所可同日語嗎？！（三）這裏應該談到物力。是的，我曾經聽過某上海敎授說過，『現代化的程度愈深，中國愈見他的缺陷。』這話，我們應當尊重，而且是有理由的。因為外貨入口之多足可證明。况乎鐵礦最豐的東北，又已脫離了中國政權的保護。然而，物質缺陷與吾是一件事，中國應否工業化又是一件事。而就實事論之，鐵礦固然略見貧乏，但較之東鄰日本，恐怕終要稍勝一籌吧！他們為何，中國又如何？漢冶萍公司的鐵砂，若無借欵條約束縛，那末這些鐵砂生產，足可以暫時供給中國鍊鐵之需了，其他如煤在世界中佔埋藏量第三席，石油的儲藏開採至少中國可以自給而有餘。（據某外人謂足可供全世界二千五百年之用？）這能謂之缺乏嗎？——所缺乏者僅科學人材，科學機械而已。但這又非重工業建設不為功。况乎礦藏之開採，資源取之於地，共利無窮，苟非舞弊中飽，當不虞虧本。烏得謂之物力不能勝任乎？——果眞的物力不敷，而高談重工業建設，那筆者眞是瘋在了。——况乎中國石油煤炭不能自給，或者平時無部份的儲存積放，那末事變非常，石油來源斷絕，公路變成空路。煤炭不能運輸，鐵路變成絕路，此豈又是未雨綢繆所能應付者？</p>
<p>綜上所論，中國重工業廠的建立，是必要而且可能的。然而，國人或者以為這原不過礦業而已，並不能謂之重工業。蓋重工業必須如美國之必得斯堡工業區，德國的克虜百工廠，日本橫濱大阪的工業區，始可以言重工業發展。那末這裏我要吿訴他，千里之行，始於跬步。中國現在談重工業發展，應該從初步入手，這是事實問題，並非理論問題，日積月纍，始可以言發展，决無一蹴可成的道理？不過中國現在應該朝這個方向進行努力是眞的。寫到這裏，我又要對某報所謂『剩餘勞動』問題試為討論之。首先，我得聲明我是一個不問報紙的立塲怎樣，只問文字的本身如何的一人。雖然那報紙的名稱，我不願而且也不便說明，然而他們以為只有使農業合作才有剩餘勞動，有剩餘勞動始可以言經濟建設，這却和我的意見相反。合作事業我很贊同，但必須保留『合作萬能論』，我不敢苟同這點意見。然后才來談到剩飴勞動。所謂剩餘勞動者不知他們所指是剩餘勞動力，抑係剩餘勞動積儲？假係前者，則中國今日已非海禁未開以前可比，在海禁未開以前，因為生產力能目給半自給，國民生活，全體沉滯在靜止的固定社會中，為人工的耕稼勞作所限，也許缺乏剩餘勞動力。但時至今日，却不相同了。這裏已非勞動力之是否有剩餘，而係外貨傾銷中百工失業，畸形的過剩勞動力如何安置的問題了。因之所謂剩餘勞動，若指勞動力而言，可以不必討論。至若乘餘勞動積儲又如何呢？中國今日，民窮財盡，國家歲收，社會財富，均不如前是實事。但這係幾十年來賠欵割地，貿易入超所種的果。其補救的對策已非單純的人事改良或合作所能有濟。除在前面資本問題中說明重工業的發展，並不一定愁資金之缺乏的叙述中，巳足可將剩餘勞動積儲的意見解答以外。我更進一步發言曰：中國茍非發展重工業，以機械代替人力，則剩餘勞動積備的社會財富，國家歲收的增加，實在不可能。人力難敵科學生產方法，縱云節儉合作，於事何補？若以為所謂農業合作者，乃係經濟的提携開發合作而言，因為這樣始有勞動積儲可言。那末我只好自認倒霉，自呼晦氣而已。</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （張鳳）</p>
<p>求學要宏博，交友要廣多，弄錢也要積攢，惟獨用情祇宣狹窄。</p>
<p>照經濟學的原則，世間無論什麼事物都可估價，用情也不例外。</p>
<p>譬如：你的愛情用在十個異性的身上，粗略地看來，似乎份是值得的，勝利的。可是，你自己估一估罷！你那用在十個異性身上的愛情，假定其每個的價值為國幣一千元，那十個的總和是一萬元，不已覺得根不少了麼？不過，你若移那分化着用在十個異性身上的愛惰，集中在一個的身上，那時這個愛情至少要值國幣十萬元！</p>
<p>不信麼，但想一想古人間，那送飯田間，相敬如賓的夫婦，那賃廡三橡舉案齊眉的夫婦，那當爐酒肆，合作買賣的夫婦，以及其他因緣美滿，佳話流傳的好夫妻們，他們相互間用情的價值，豈但什百倍於一班朝四暮三，為愛不卒，而還自詡是多情種子之流所作所為而已哉？</p>
<p>試一試罷，這個經儕集中方式的用情之道！</p>
<h3>假肚皮</h3>
<p>— 臥佛</p>
<p>雖則同樣是用人工做的假肚皮，但這一種假肚皮，比了那些有綫人家，因為膝下尙虛，恐怕偌大家財，無人享用，因而演上那一套假肚皮的滑稽劇的，當然不可同日而語。</p>
<p>我本沒有這資格去憐憫入家，但我每一次回鄕時見到這種事情，常常給在腦海中縈繞得很久很久的，終於使我不能不把寫出來。</p>
<p>那些『晒海』為活的給人侮蔑做「海頭婆」者，固然不用說了，就是離開海灘根遼遠的婦女們，在此農村破產，機器略奪人工，男子們又多數遭受失業之下，伊們偽了生活的壓迫，也只得去販賣那比較可以賺錢的私鹽。但在緝私嚴緊的時候，那裏容許你肩挑背負，何况婦女們畢竟氣力有限，肩頭背上，也不能勝任多量的私鹽，打成包裹等種種的模樣吧，也難逃避緝私者的銳利的富有經騐的眼光。於是伊們在向晒海的人家秘密地購進了二三十斤鹽後，相率盛在特製的布袋內，再用布條捆在肚皮上，手裏再提了一些油瓶竹籃趕路，算是懷孕的樣子。這種辦法，起初倒能瞞過一時，後來因為大肚皮的婦人太多了，啟了聰明的緝私者的疑竇，一經搜查，便給發覺了這一個秘密。尙幸一些比較同情的緝私者，因見伊們太可憐，販的數量又少，多數還肯高抬貴手，放過伊們。所以伊們還得仗這假肚皮維持斷續的生命。但是，伊們在趕路時，因為急促，惶駭，全身淌着汗，汗滴浸入鹽中，化為鹹，待到目的地，總把整個的肚皮漬遍了。先是顯着淡白色，隱隱作痛，久之，肚上的皮，一片片的脫落下來，這情形是敎人何等的慘痛呀！然而，要吃飯，伊們還是把肚皮像醃肉一般的天天醃呢。唉！</p>
<h3>金魚漫話</h3>
<p>— 吳吉人</p>
<p>金魚以殊色而博人愛，購置數尾，蓄養玻璃缸中，顧又往往不崇朝而僵，人且以為金魚乃嬌貴之品，誠難養也豈知玻缸陳水，中置三五錦鱗，入目之，似已予彼以優游之境地，而皆未審玻璃透明，感光過甚，魚在其中，反多障礙，蓋魚初不知有水，猶人之曾未見有空氣也，彼不能開合之魚目，見光亮即進撞，玻缸之魚難永壽，並非犯撞而傷，大凡魚豢沙缸，換淸水已不能進食，（欲令換淸水速食，祗須在換水後稍攙老綠水和之。）何况玻缸淸澈如鏡，蓋以四周玻片感光强烈，重重翳障，已背其養生之道。人且予食不息，（其實金魚餓倒餓不死。）水虱不能存活於淸水，逾三數時立斃，使魚已食盡，固無礙，否則缸水已臭，魚浮頭水面，不能須更留，人或知之而更以熟水，斯可矣，否則亦殆。至如有油質之食物，更不相宜，即飯　粥粒，亦祗宜日給少許，侯其食罄再予，因過多必水混，魚亦非所宜也。故我曰，今日市間之玻缸，（除平面方缸，）根本不合養魚，設缸口敞豁，而水分調合平勻，猶可稍留時日，倘口徑小，水分混濁，必死無疑。然則有法乎？曰，淸水宜攙綠水，色現淡靑，食時，另撈面盆或沙缸中，食畢，再撈玻缸，即可减少死亡率，謂予不信，曷一試之？（近正在打樣與某玻璃廠定製合乎養金魚之玻缸，還當貢之於世也，）最好室外另備一小沙缸，欲作室中點綴者，僅能日易幾尾作拱養，每晚仍回沙缸，可少受損，惟魚之尺度，亦須與玻缸水量相稱，過大則萬難稍住晷刻也。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第六回　鐵面見親心語瞞鸚鵡　蛾眉存俠氣問典崑崙</p>
<p>小菊道：老爺雖是厲害，可沒有打過小姐。夢蘭道：唉！你懂得什麼？我情願挨打，也不願過這種日子呢。於是站起來，到洗臉架子邊，就用凉手中擦了一把臉。又把小梳子攏了一攏頭髮。回頭問問小菊道：我衣服睡得有皺紋瑪？給我牽牽。小菊道：你換一伴罷，衣後襟讓你睡起好多皺紋了。老爺看到又是一頓說。夢蘭倒不反對他這句話，自取了一件衣服，到帳孑裏換好，然後站到鏡子邊，對了鏡子，把紐扣一個個都扣好了，又摸了一摸衣領，扯了兩扯衣襟，一切都已安排妥當，這就下樓　母　屋裏來。只走到房門外，先就，站定，呌了聲爹，然後，緩步走了進去。　時，江浩然，那一臉的正氣，完全都擺了出來。每一個亳毛孔裏，也找不出一絲笑容。未曾說話，他板着臉，先對夢蘭仔細看了一看。夢蘭自是靜靜的站着，微低了頭下去。浩然微微的點着下已頰道：你坐下罷，我有話向你說夢蘭看看父親，又看看母親，就在對面一張椅子上，半側了身子坐下。江太太道：你爹呌你出來，也沒有什麼要緊的事。不過有幾句作人的大道理，同你說說。其實你讀書很明理的，作人的事，當然也知道，不過提醒醒你就是了。夢蘭聽母親所說的話，很覺得不自然，他心裏不怎麼安寗，也可想而知的。因之自己更是把頭低着，彷彿是像在禮拜堂裏作禱告一樣，這顆心全舒貼在上帝的脚下了。浩然咳嗽了兩聲，才接着道：我先要聲明一句的，我並不是年輕人所認的那裏頑固父母，要不然，我肯送你到學堂裏去讀書嗎，不過我想一個人，要守點舊道德，凡事退一步想，才能够處事泰然，得一種樂趣。譬如我們這個家庭，比那　大富大貴的人家，自然相差得很遠。然而我們能够退一步想，想到不如我們的，連吃飯穿衣，全照顧不過來，我們心裏頭也就担然了。聽到說，你心裏不痛快，常常的發牢騷，我不知道你這牢騷，是從何而來。我想，你出門去是一位女學生，進得家來，是一位大小姐，還有什麼事是會讓你發牢騷的。夢蘭抵了頭，决不答應他父親所問的一個字。浩然見他不作聲就抽了兩袋水烟。屋子裏只有那呼吸水烟的聲音，一切都寂然。約莫有兩三分鐘之久。（七〇）</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>呌哥哥</h3>
<p>— 霞飛</p>
<p>幾天以前，我們門口有一個向下人挑來了一擔呌哥哥，這些呌哥哥全被裝在一隻篾籠裏面；但這篾龍子是沒有門的，要想　它出來，除非要把籠子毀了才行。它就只有永遠被關在籠子裏，直到它死。可是它却不知道悲哀，儘活潑地在那僅能容身的方寸間轉　着，並喳喳喳的呌着。</p>
<p>因為孩子嗓着要，所以我也買了兩隻；於是，孩子便非常歡喜的把它們掛到了樓上窗口，並且，還去找了些茅黃莢，和飯糗來喂給它們吃。我看這兩隻呌哥哥有些像蚱蜢，也有點像蝗蟲呌起來的聲音，有點像知了，也有些像紡織娘。據說；鄕下人捕捉呌哥哥是在黃昏或五更裏，用了網到南瓜籐蔓中去趕的。</p>
<p>我們買來的兩隻呌哥哥很會呌，而且，愈熱愈呌得起勁；不論在深夜黃昏，或白晝早　，它們總是喳喳喳的呌着，不知疲倦，也不知口渴。雖然，它們身體是被囚在一屋六角式而僅留着許多小洞眼的子籠，永遠求不得出來，可是，它們好像沒有知覺，只是和樂天派的詩人一樣，此唱彼和的嚷着。也許，它們是在唱什麼快樂的歌曲。但我却不懂得呌哥哥為什麼要唱歌；為戀愛嗎，還是為生活？為苦悶嗎，或是為快樂？是在讚美夏大，還是在咒詛人類？我永遠也不明白它們為什麼要唱歌，這恐怕正如人類一樣地在無病呻吟吧！</p>
<p>本來，我對於一些昆蟲是不大注意的，但自從我買了這呌哥哥之後，覺得那些小動物也實在有可愛的地方。</p>
<p>呌哥哥大槪是怕凉的所以像氣候凉了點，呌哥哥便不再會聽到它無日無夜的唱歌了。並且，牠們在籠子裏也失却了活潑的姿態。孩子看着它們很失望，以為它們是病了，因此，把牠們放到露水草裏，再放到太陽中，像是一個母親在擔心自己孩子的生命一樣，然而依舊沒有用。</p>
<p>有一晚上，氣候突然又轉了熱，於是掛在窗口而幾乎被人遺忘的呌哥哥，又高興地唱和了起來。—孩子聽到了它們的呌，從睡夢中也醒了過來，快活得什麼似的。</p>
<p>這孩子也有點奇怪，伊對於隨便什麼玩具都不愛，而却非常愛護那對呌哥哥，而且為了它們的吃，曾經向許多人打聽過。</p>
<p>「呌哥哥是吃什麼的？」差不多看見了每一個人都會這樣的問，後來車夫阿憨吿訴了伊，說呌哥哥是要吃南瓜花的，於是伊就天天噪着要伊媽去買南瓜花，可是都市裏沒有人家種南瓜，更沒有地方去找南瓜花；雖則妻曾經託過小菜塲賣小菜的鄕下人，但終於給遺忘了</p>
<p>那天我到眞如去參觀鄕村敎育實騐區和愛倫羊奶塲，順便在田間摘了幾朶南瓜花來，才總算饜了孩子的慾望。</p>
<p>孩子太像我，也像伊母親，對於戀舊的脾氣是很深的。而據說呌哥哥不但呌得好聽，並且還能够避痧，因此妻也很愛它們。</p>

<h3>友人和女人</h3>
<p>— （紫英）</p>
<p>法郎士說：「在生命的旅途上，友人是你的唯一的安　者。」又說：「女人只能使你的靈魂潤濕，而不能使你的靈魂充實；友人在後者的要求中，給予你最大的襄助，」不錯，友情是可寶貴的，當你在煩悶，失望：的時候，它能够安慰你，鼓勵你，它能够使人排除一切困難，使人向上進取。</p>
<p>不過法郎士所說的，「友人」，應該是眞正的知己；而他所說的「女人」，制是一些卑鄙的蕩婦罷了。</p>
<h3>愛迪生的妙語</h3>
<p>— 姚明然</p>
<p>有一個人問大發明家愛迪生說：「天才是一種靈感嗎」？愛迪生回答道：「天才的百分之九十八是汗血的工作，靈感只占其中的二分！」那個人便被救醒了天才的迷夢，天才的錯覺者，讀此可以覺悟了呢！</p>
<h3>瑤池</h3>
<p>— 汪老欽</p>
<p>瑤池為王母娘娘昇仙之處，據集仙傳云，池亦崑崙之圃，但近據甘肅來客云，該省涇川縣涇水湖畔的土山上，亦有瑤池一座，淺草平野，風景殊佳，一個王母有兩處瑤池，究竟誰眞誰假，倒使人難以索解，難道當時王母娘娘的瑤池，也像現代的要人公館一樣，亦有正副之分嗎？</p>
<h3>賣冰的孩子</h3>
<p>— 敏子</p>
<p>天熱啦，黃狗吐着舌頭在樹陰下乘風凉。</p>
<p>有綫的公子少爺在喝着鮮橋水，少奶奶在電風扇下抹胭脂，預備上夜花園露天跳舞塲去。</p>
<p>外瞰，賣冰的孩子在背着枇杷簍嗄着嗓子喊：「冷陰哦，賣冰哦，冰哦冰哦賣冰哦！」</p>
<p>太陽把柏油路上的油蒸了出來，可是他們依舊急促地在太陽下面走着，不允許他脚步有一些兒綏慢，把脚步緩慢了，就得把簍着的冰化成水，所以雖然身上祇披了件破布衫，脚上祇穿了雙破套鞋，在太陽的燒煉下，他們像丟入了火炕，他們要掙扎。</p>
<p>從大街到小巷，從中午到黃昏，不許有一刻的休息，雖然嗓子是喊得發了啞，他不肯去嘗一些簍着的冰塊潤潤喉，賣完了，又得幹到冰鮮船去販，那狹窄的跳板，人走在上面全身起了有力的顫抖。給太陽燒昏了的頭腦，脚軟很擔心着失足的危險，可是為了那幾個銅元，又怎得不拚命地幹！</p>
<p>好容易買到了二十個子那麼一堆，為了是裝的浦包，巡捕老爺就得說你是不合衛生，於是有老爺地方的踪跡，再也不敢喊，偷偷地溜了過去，眞和作賊一般。</p>
<p>他們忍着可怕的太陽，忍着巡捕的棍子，他們喊破了喉嚨，踏破了脚底。</p>
<p>可是他們為的是甚麼？這賣冰的孩子。</p>

<h3>治療淋病之基本理論</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働醫科大學院畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>由動物試騐之結果——　證明淋病惟有增進血液中之免疫體，　始獲根本全部治愈。</p>
<p>淋病自昔即被視為難治之疾病，即今日科學昌明，在未經施用淋病最新療法之醫師，對于淋病，亦至感棘手。雖淋藥日新月異，然其藥理類皆陳陳相因，故其為效，亦無特殊功績。</p>
<p>惟近頃吾醫界忽發貝一珍異之金鑛，開淋病治療上亘古未有之奇績，蓋即淋病聖樂「克淋儂」之問世也。</p>
<p>一般人對於「克淋儂」之理論，尙未十分明瞭。茲撮述大要如下：一八九〇年Romer博士曾發明用馬之類脂汁配為製劑，注射於曾經淋菌接種之動物體內，而取其血液觀之（鏡檢），則見淋菌失其活動力。一九〇三Christmas敎授更以動植物兩類之類脂肪及胆汁，調劑而注入牛之體內（已受淋菌接種）。未注射本製劑前，取該牛之分泌物，以試騐管斜面培養基，作淋菌之純培養，則見菌體目培養基面剝離浮游。施用本劑後，培養上淋菌即全部死滅。其後Biedel。乃復以動植物類脂與胆汁，侣合純凈之色素，製為內服淋病聖藥「可淋儂」，迭經動植物試騐，及施用於人體，皆奏美效。poetes氏以此藥用於急性淋男病人（九〇乃至九七％）Torrey氏施之慢性睪丸及攝護腺淋之男病人（八〇乃至九三％）Herbsl博士施於婦人淋毒性白帶（並外用「卡而雪地」為坐藥。——（九〇乃至九七％）Ballenger氏施於關節炎（七二乃至八三％），平均有百分之九十五服「克淋儂」全部根治不發云。</p>
<h3>美滿的發育為長命之基礎</h3>
<p>— 陸軍醫科大學畢業宋忠鈺醫師</p>
<p>荷爾蒙缺乏為致發育不良之原因</p>
<p>發育為人生健康上最重要之問題。發育佳良，則健康多壽，反之必夭促天年。考荷爾蒙機能，與發育有最密切之關係。如腦下垂體，松果腺，甲狀腺，胸腺，副腎，生殖腺等荷爾蒙旺盛，其人必體格高大，聲音嘹喨，精神飽滿，腎部雄偉。否則身體瘦小，精神萎靡，性器短小。其原因有由於先天不足，或後天濫行手淫，耗傷赫爾蒙等所致。治法以服唯一荷爾蒙製劑「補體康」為最，其因過度手淫而致遺精衰弱者，則宜以「補體康」與「耐而斯遺精片」同時進服。</p>
<p>患者姜若琛君，幼年犯有手淫習慣，時起遺精。發育不全，性器短小。勃起不壯，頭暈健忘。結婚後，身體衰弱，不克勝任。兼患早洩。夫婦均苦之，屢藥不效。更復陰萎，姜君悲莫能已。幸由至友賈善達君介紹，來余處治療。余診係荷爾蒙機能衰憊，乃投服「補體康」以昂進其機能。因「補體康」為勇壯動物之荷爾蒙製成，有促增發育旺盛性能之殊效。故姜君服藥三瓶，即自覺腎部回春，腰背有力。乃繼續服用前藥，並服「耐而斯遺精片」以治遺精，為期月許，一切性能萎弱之症，均獲痊治。且肌肉堅實，面色紅潤，精神煥發云。</p>
<h3>姚菊巖醫師淋病講座</h3>
<p>診所　四川路寗波路轉角　診時　上午十時至下午六時</p>
<p>慢性淋之根除法</p>
<p>慢性淋時淋病上一重大問題，蓋以淋病既成慢性，變幻莫測，根治最難，然决非不治之症，實因治療未獲其法耳。大抵淋病之成慢性的原因，不一而足，而大多由於初起延宕失治，或醫治而不得其法。而患者又因急性期已過，表面上之痛苦减少，遂毫不措意。一方淋菌又潛入深部，暗中活躍，故深部病灶，益見擴大，而增重治療上之困難，偶遇外界刺戟，即砰然暴發，如不急事處置，往往因此而喪失生殖機能，而可懼之流毒，即傳染妻子，以致妻子之白帶加多，此等毒性白帶，最易殺滅精虫，成為子嗣上一大問題。</p>
<p>抑尤甚者，兩性如皆已染淋病，雖一方治愈，則對方治未愈者，仍為之傳染，余於此病，遇之甚多，有住法大馬路某里之徐百剛君，年廿六歲，已婚四年，而罹淋病者，則已五年矣，其夫人婚後亦即被染，後由友人介紹余處，主訴此病歷治多年，雖有數次治愈，但不戒於房事，故復被傳染。現已成關節炎及膀胱炎，內子白帶，亦時雜有血絲，腔道刺痛以致月經不調云云，余即用抗淋血淸及電氣療法，更進服『克淋儂』以抗淋殺滅其廣泛之淋菌，如是醫治五星期，即獲根治，其夫人淋毒性白帶仍囑其內服『克淋儂』，而　道中用『卡氏陰道片』為坐藥，四星期後，炎消痛止，淋帶並絕。偕居至今未再發。</p>
<h3>癆病百問</h3>
<p>— 前南洋醫科大學敎授鄧源和醫師</p>
<p>診所：寗波路四川路口　診時：下午四時至六時</p>
<p>4．療養以精神安靜為主，抑以肉體安靜為主？</p>
<p>5．安靜療法之目的究何在？</p>
<p>近世對於肺癆病之處置，已脚往日大有進步。昔時肺病人之就醫東奔西走，甚至舟車勞頓，不知安靜休息，故結果往往不良。</p>
<p>自知肺病之原因，為結核菌侵蝕肺部所致，一般乃諳欲使肺病痊愈，惟有使病灶部份，完全愈合。而欲其愈合，則非有充分之安靜修養，使肺部减少呼吸運動不為功，故安靜療法，乃居首要，襄余承乏南洋醫大敎務，同學與余討論肺病問題，多着重於此。實際上，妥靜療法，有使精神安靜與肉體安靜之各異。精神安靜，動以避免許多無謂之情感，為洽愈肺病之間接條件。肉體安靜，功能减少肺之呼吸運動，故較重要。</p>
<p>但職業人對於療養上，頗多障碍，更難有長期之臥養，以使肉體安靜，故殊感困難。無已則惟有求之一種特效藥物，給予肺部之機能休息，而促進其治愈。具此殊效之藥有徒梅氏之『補肺拿爾』。此藥對於男女肺病，無論各期均有卓騐。凡肺病而兼患神經衰弱，頭痛失眠，心悸健忘等，可用『補肺拿爾』合用補體荷爾蒙製劑進服。如男用『補體康』女用『補女容』是也。『補體康』又能治肺病人之腰痛，陰萎，發育不良。如有遺精，可兼服『耐不良。如有遺精，可兼服『耐而斯遺精片』。『補女容』能調整肺病婦女之月經，經痛，如有白帶，可外用『卡而雪地』為坐藥。至於肺病之欬血咳嗽，血痰胸痛，潮熱盜汗，身體孱瘦等。則非主用『補肺拿爾』以補肺滅癆不可也。</p>
<h3>沉溺于自瀆之一靑年</h3>
<p>— 宋忠鈺醫師</p>
<p>面現菜色，遺精萎弱諸症並治。</p>
<p>患手淫自凟之人，以少年至靑年人為最甚。一經嘗試，便成惡癖。流連忘反，遂陷肉體精神於衰弱，而釀致頑固難除之遺精症。遺精症之種類甚多，有夢精，白晝滑精，大小便或用力時，精液漏洩等，而其病理，則皆由手淫斲傷性神經，因之輸精管馳張，故精液遺洩。遺精倘不對症服以「耐而斯遺精片」，則精液愈流愈竭，由是腦弱失眠，心悸健忘，思考及判斷力銳减，陰萎，勃起力不壯等，均層見迭出。</p>
<p>曾有患者胡光偉君，患手淫多年，內在年少，固無何種病狀。及年稍張，而身體矮小如舊。瘦削，性器短小，每週輒有二三回或五六回遺精，記憶力銳减，學業退步，形銷骨立。其家為一舊式家庭，乃為之完婚以冲喜，詎知加以房勞，胡君之病體，更形孱弱，腎萎不舉，早洩，虛象蠭起。聞友人韓少康君，服「補體康」治愈腎虧。乃購服二瓶，大見起色！來余處檢騐，余當囑其續服「補體康」，同時並服「耐而斯遺精片」治其遺精，二藥計服六瓶，各症俱失。精强力壯，體重大增。今歷五月，發育健好，肌肉壯實，已成為昂藏偉丈夫矣。</p>
<h3>經亂失眠之後果</h3>
<p>— 陳少華醫師</p>
<p>停孕多病玉容從此為憔悴</p>
<p>女性月經，大多每間二十八日來潮一次，來時並無任何痛苦，此為生理的月經，但許多婦女，因不知攝生，或因早婚房事過度，或因無知而犯惡癖，或因生產頻繁而使氣血兩虛，於是卵巢機能，失去正常值排卵工作，故月經紊亂。神經衰弱，失眠煩躁，易罹沈鬱，白帶下，因此對於生殖力上亦大受影響，故因神經衰弱，月經不調等而招停孕之研究，竟達百分之八十五以上。唇白貧血，玉顏憔悴，許多美滿姻緣，因此破裂，而遭逢嚴重之後果。</p>
<p>對於此病之極有效處置，無過於內服女用荷爾蒙製劑，此藥為矯正卵巢與調和黃體機能之特效劑，同時促生新細胞，排除體內一切陳腐之細胞，使生殖系機能亢進，而達到調經受孕力之目的。更因「補女容」有促增新陳代謝機能，故服後能使肌膚粉嫩，彌補額上皺紋，豐姿約綽，恢復原有年齡之靑春美，而享受人生應有之幸福，故歐美諸邦，自有「補女容」問世以後，一半婦女之健康與生殖力，已不若從前之脆弱無能，觀此亦足證「補女容」效力之偉大矣。</p>
<h3>內分泌療法最近新趨勢</h3>
<p>— 日本帝國醫科大學陳宗堃醫師</p>
<p>選材謹嚴，製法合理；</p>
<p>然後物盡其用，用必有功。</p>
<p>近頃內分泌療法，有長足之進步？其製法各別，功效不同，蓋此種內分泌製劑之精粗，對於功效上有既十分重要，而原料紙選擇，尤須用科學方法，嚴加鑑別，蓋製法粗陋，原料不純，雖有內分泌製劑之名，而無內分泌療病之效。例如同一用Lipuide　testicnlaire注射，但一則用雄壯動物，一則用年齡衰老，及有暗疾之動物，則其功效大相懸殊矣。此應用內分泌療法時，必須嚴其選擇也。</p>
<p>然以現在世界醫學家公認為最滿意之製劑，厥為德人發明之男用「補體康」，女用「補女容」，此二藥，係擷取靑春旺盛期之獸類荷爾蒙，復用科學方法，去浮存實，分別製成之，歷經歐美各大學敎授實地試騐，康密斯大學敎授孟克博士，曾用「補體康」治愈之由手淫而來發育不全之男子，其下部發育，僅及成人三分之一，矮小異常幷有遺早洩之患，孟博先試用荷爾蒙泌製劑十種，迄無效果，後乃改用「補體康」。總計前後服用未達二月，即見發育正常，遺精早洩，及由遺精早洩而來之頭痛失眠，心悸健忘，腰酸背楚，四肢無力等，皆歸治愈，完全為一個毫無缺陷之美男子，自經孟氏此番實地試騐成功後，「補體康」遂為世界醫家所藥用。僉認「補體康」一藥，為內分泌療法中最有權威之製劑。</p>
<h3>幾成腐爛陰莖之淋病</h3>
<p>— 南通醫大畢業武鍾麟醫師</p>
<p>患者洪善之君，皖籍，少年即隨父在滬經商多年，因商界應酬關係，故早年已涉足花業，染得下疳，後雖一度治愈，但從此雖偶亦應酬，亦未敢再作高唐之夢，不料前歲又因大醉之後，重入高唐，歸未幾，即寒熱交作，洪君仍為下疳也，私服下疳藥而無效，後始知此次所患者非下疳而為淋病也。迭用透膜殺菌燈局部內服劑，仍刮功效，且小便艱難加甚，淋絲與膿血球交互而出，其陰莖前段，尤覺腫痛，經友人介紹，乞余醫治，見其前尿道腫大，且有兩處腐蝕成穴，（如第一圖）其他攝　腺亦覺腫大，除行按摩外，投以「克淋儂」以消炎防腐，利尿鎭痛，服三星期後，局部之腫痛已去十之七八，惟空洞尙未十分填滿，故小便時猶微感痛楚，再進服至二星期後，腫痛全消，更用尿道反射　檢查，前日腐爛之二空洞，已完全治愈，平復如常，此為「克淋儂」防腐殺菌力强大之鐵證。然洪君如不及早醫治，則陰莖因腐爛而障礙生殖，或完全不能生殖之危險矣。</p>
<h3>第一圖</h3>
<p>未服「克淋儂」前尿道內之炎腫空洞。</p>
<h3>第二圖</h3>
<p>服「克淋儂」後炎腫已消，恢復原狀。</p>
<h3>秋天的胃病</h3>
<p>— 武鍾麟醫師</p>
<p>照例秋天的胃口，總較夏天好，但因為好，所以往往貪食過飽，又因天氣忽冷忽熱，所以也容易釀成胃病的，象這幾天到我診所來的病人，胃病特別的多，這豈不是胃病與秋天有關係的證明嗎？他們的病，大抵胸悶，噯氣吞酸，胃院作痛，偶爾多食即飽悶不堪，口臭逼人（患病的多不自覺）苔厚舌苦，食而無味，大便閉結，或相反的溏泄。屁如連珠。如此消化機能不良，往往有釀成胃癌，或盲腸炎之危險。切勿輕視。</p>
<p>余醫治此等症狀，除了呌他們注意攝生之外，即囑服「强胃精」，以推動消化機能，因此藥含有高價之酵母及維他命，鈣等貴重成分，所以對消化不良，飲食擁滯胃腸中，有迅速消化滌淸之功，且因有推動消化機能，故服「强胃精」後於二星期左右，立見功效。又因此藥有大量維他命B，故對脚氣亦有功效。際此初秋寒暖不常，飢飽無節，最易損害胃腸機能，故「强胃精」一藥，尤不可不備也。</p>

<p>關節腫痛</p>
<p>何大諤君：關節腫痛，係淋毒性關節炎，宜服「克淋儂」以撲滅廣泛淋菌，則厥疾可愈，或請姚菊巖醫師行抗淋血淸與電療等亦可。至尊夫人白帶月經不調，可服「克淋儂」以除淋，「補女容」以調經，外用「陰道片」為坐藥，以除帶。</p>

<h3>棚戶敎育</h3>
<p>— 劍平</p>
<p>上月，草棚為了被逼强遷，而引起大多數人的同情，於是，那一向被歧視，甚至永沒人過問的，生活在地獄一般的人間的所被稱為「棚戶」「人渣」，漸漸地給一般人注意了。當然，一般還帶着劣根性的上流人物之所謂「注意」，仍未免有點滑稽的意味，但是，他們的那比狗還不如的生活，赤裸裸地暴露在一切人的面前，也是一件很好的事。——最少，可以使一些關在門內說風凉話的人們，知道這社會裏眞的還有這一種類的「人渣」存在：同時明白了這還不是他們心目中所被粉飾成的那天堂般的社會，那距離還遠得很。</p>
<p>在加以注意以後，當然有所謂「反饗」的。這些反響無疑地都是善意的，雖然是帶着悲天憫人的人道的慈善者的「善」意。</p>
<p>棚戶敎育的被提出，便是這一類「善」意的反饗裏面的一個。</p>
<p>關於這，我們還曾經看到過一個很完備的，也是很精密的，實施棚戶敎育的計劃大綱。（這是去月中旬發表在幾個大報上的）。現在，把這「實施棚戶敎育計劃大綱」稍稍介紹一點罷。在「目標」和「方針」這兩項，不消說，那是一點也再不能補充的了。同時，可以很簡單地說，這計劃大綱的最主要的，也是最特殊的地方，是「以娛樂引起他們受敎育的興趣」，因此在「事業」這，一項裏，我們便看到了不少關於「娛樂」的，和側重於「休閒敎育」這一方面的設計了。所開的菜單如「棚戶娛樂室，棚戶茶園，簡易運動塲，音樂會，遊藝會，棚戶同樂會，等等。」都是很完備的。其次，這計劃大綱也注意「衛生敎育」，在這一項目，又開了「撲除蚊蠅隊，拒毒棚戶診療所，健康指導，衛生展覽，等等。」眞可說是十全十美了。</p>
<p>假如，這一敎育可以「實施」，那當然是最好不過的事了，「棚戶」也變成「天堂」了，還有什麼「人問痛苦」。不過，可惜的是，眞正的事實却沒有這麽美滿啦，現在，我們讓事實來做一個公平的證人罷：</p>
<p>二日晚報和三日各大報載：滬東區棚戶，又於二日晨被逼拆遝，致發生流血慘劇。計棚戶受傷者逾三十餘人，當塲被拘捕者有孫漢奎等八名，暫押楊樹浦捕房，三日晨當可轉解法院。</p>
<h3>上海慈幼敎養院訪問記（上）</h3>
<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>（本報特寫）昨天，我特地到塘山路去訪問了中華慈幼協會主辦的上海慈幼敎養院。</p>
<p>從鐵門里遞進了一張名片，由一個十多歲的孩子來把我開了進去：當我吿訴了他的來意之後，他就到里面去通知了。走進里面，一位敎職員麥女士把我招待到了會客廳里。</p>
<p>那個會客應是很大的，里面的陳設也很簡潔雅緻，壁上除了懸着許多表格及照相外，還有各院生的成績一斑。麥女士在會客廳里和我談了幾句話之後，她就忽忽的走了出去，但不多時候她却取了一本「上海慈幼敎養院一覽」進來，一頁一頁的翻給我看，而且詳細的替我講着。</p>
<p>該院創辦於民國十九年，至今雖祗有短短的六個年頭，然而內部的負責人已經四度更易，院址亦已三遷其地；而現在還因為院中經費和地方的關係，所以收容院生祗限八十名，額滿便停止收容。目前，院中經常費用每年總在一萬二千元以上，而此項經費除工部局津貼一部份外，其餘完全由中華慈幼協會撥給的。</p>
<p>這里現在已有男生三十三名，女生四十七名，共七十八人，離限額尙少二人。而所有院生多數是公安局及租界捕房所移送來者，自己請求進院的比較少數；因為凡自己請求或由傍人送院的，必須塡具入院申請書，覓得妥保，並且要經院中派員調查，確是孤苦無依者，方能照准。</p>
<p>院中女生多於男生的原因，據說因為最近蓄婢解放運動的關係，有一部份婢女被解放以後，因無家可歸，便被送到了這兒來。其他留養機關中亦有派去。</p>
<p>他們是以敎養兒童為職志的，因此，除留養外，更注重的是敎育工作。現該院所附設的一個上海慈幼小學，就是專門給該院各生求學的一個機關。</p>
<p>各生的入院年齡為五歲至十八歲，入院後，一切衣食住完全由院供給；但年在十歲以上之院生除受敎育外，須擔任院中的淸潔工作及勞働服務，女生却須撫領幼生，縫紉，烹調等，分工合作，所以姊弟兄妹，融融樂樂地儼如一個幸福家庭。不過入院各生無故不得請求出院，如有親戚或家屬來認領時聽便，有人願意領為子女或擇為配偶者，祗須塡具申請書，覓得妥保後，給院中派員調查，認為可靠者亦能照准。然而該生出院後之生活環境，仍由院中隨時監護</p>
<p>敎務方面，他們極其注重於成績考查，和自修輔導，課外研究，這幾項，此外，敎材的選擇，敎法的研究，童軍的訓練等亦很注意。尤其是訓育部份，對於秩序，衛生，禮貌，知恥，勤勉，公益，誠實，勞動，節儉，自治等十種訓練，非常認眞。還有對於院生的行為考查，及懲獎方法，更其是非常嚴厲的</p>
<p>除了平常的課外運動，每年有幾趟短途旅行，可以到近郊去野餐，或公園中去散步。娛樂方面也不缺少，譬如，聯歡會，電影，話劇，團體遊藝等，他們每兩個月必須舉行一次。而院生能演戲的人才也頗多；他們有一個慈幼話劇社，本年兒童節在市府表演「兒童節前夜」一劇，曾得到了相當的佳評。</p>
<h3>心理建設</h3>
<p>— 澎</p>
<p>北國的秋天，秋風整日地鳴着凄凉的號子，挾着黃沙，捲着桑子樹上的枯黃的落葉，在大皇小學的空洞的敎室中迴盪着；四週的房屋給風拍得「嚓嚓」地響。小窗的玻璃板像是在哭，板壁上糊着的枯黃的焦紙也在互相訴說着怨語。</p>
<p>淸晨，陽光遝沒有出現，天是陰暗的。孩子們零散地坐在敎室中，一個個都無精打彩地，睜着一對疲乏的眼兒，像是沒有睡醒了好覺，黃色的液體從他一們浮腫的面孔上密密地擠出來。</p>
<p>友邦的監學威武地坐在講學靠左邊的一張太獅椅上，大腿翹着二腿，泰然的抽着雪茄烟。他望着悠悠地地飄在空中的烟質，便得意地笑了。</p>
<p>在監學的兩邊嘴唇角，笑着還沒有從耳孕那裏回到原來的狀態的時侯；第一堂上課的鈴聲，便在大皇小學每個角落裏響起來了。震動了校長與敎員的神經，也搖亂了孩子們的心。</p>
<p>鈴聲平靜後，跟着秋天的淡薄陽光路進敎室中來的是國文敎員王得明；一個廿五六歲的靑年，</p>
<p>他的心悸動着，大而深陷的眼眶中含着惑涼的光芒，腿是那樣地沒力，毫無勇氣地踏上了講堂，並且還裝出很有禮貌地對友邦的監學，行了一個禮。</p>
<p>不等到孩子們將書打開，王得明便用着顫慄的聲音問道：「第一號張小　站起來，」他望了一望站在他面前那個坐位上，只剩了皮包骨頭的孩子：「俺問你，咱們是那一國人？」</p>
<p>孩子翻着一對疸黃的眼睛珠子，遲疑了一下，古里巴巴地答道：「咱們是</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>……咱們是滿洲國人！」</p>
<p>軟弱得像一隻見了火舌蛇的耗子。</p>
<p>孩子們都摒着氣，等待着問題臨到自己的腦袋上，彷彿一隻站在大沙漠中等待着千斤的重擔落到自己身上來的駱駝一般。敎室中死一般地寂靜，隱穩地可以聽得見遠處友邦軍隊的早操，沉重地脚步敲着靑石板街上的淸脆的聲音。</p>
<p>「第二個是誰，站起來？」王德明恨不得一下子，將這呆板的口試問過去：對於這忘記了祖國，忘記了敵入的心理建設的問答，他的內心隱隱地感到痛了：「俺問你，要答得快，越快越好，咱們是那一國人？</p>
<p>第二個孩子站起來，毫不思索地答道：「咱們是中國人！」接着就好像已經意識到自己的問題答錯了，便趕快地為自己辯着：「不，不，不，先生，我們是滿洲國人，我們是滿洲國人！」</p>
<p>孩子的面孔上嚇變了色，恐怖地痛苦地抽動着。兩隻手趕緊地將腦袋抱着，彷彿沉重的竹鞭子，已經擊到腦袋上來了。</p>
<p>王德明又偷偷地望了坐在一邊的監學一眼，他的鷹似的眼睛中透出了遍人的凶橫的緊張的光芒。他已經從他的坐位上面立了起來，王德明也跟着孩子們的身體顫慄起來了。他一下子，很吃力地冲到了那孩子的面前，抓起了那孩子腦袋上的小辮子，就是一耳刮子。</p>
<p>孩子痛苦地用兩手蒙着臉子，鳥色的嘴唇。恐怖地動着，露在兩隻手的中間。一對蒼白的胆怯的眼光在向他哀求着寬恕，嘴裏吚吚唔唔地響着，像是想說出一句話來，只是不敢開口，彷彿把一切的痛苦都迸在胸中。</p>
<p>突然，一種非人間的可怕的銳呌，幾乎要從王德明的胸中迸發出來了。他看得淸楚，坐在他面前被他擊了一耳括子的是他天眞的弟弟王小虎……他的身體更抖得凶了，臉痙孿地動着，他發着可怕一般的瘋症倒在地下了……。</p>
<h3>村景</h3>
<p>— 允海</p>
<p>陳家村是一個好地方。這象一頭雄壯的獅子伸田的兩變前腿，後面靠山，前面臨海。</p>
<p>臨海這一面，有很不少碼頭，每天都經常有那打從縣城里開來的小駁輪在這里停泊，它給這鄉村帶來許多好的，或是不好的消息，或者是一切生意的市價。連接着碼頭是一個小市塲，從前這里的生意是很不錯的，巳經建起了不少店舖。</p>
<p>這里曾經有過一個很可以驕傲的時候，那便是七年前陳裕老爺大財主剛從舊金山帶回來了不少金銀珠寳這未大的來頭便把附近四十六鄉的人駭驚了。只要一提到了陳家村姓陳的，人們便令害怕和欽羨。那市塲和田野的中間，巍然也象衙門那末地堅立着的便是「陳府」。那里有砲樓，有幾重鐵門，更有那輝煌的半西洋式的建築。一個還沒有到過省城的老鄉走過，眞有點驚異啦，不知是什末天神打發下來的大怪物。</p>
<p>現在，這一切光榮都跟着那寳貴的時候溜走了。一切繁榮都給那無情的砲火轟掉了。——陳家村便是在幾次莫明其妙的戰爭下毀了的。</p>
<p>小駁輪已沒了從前那末神氣，那黑烟也沒有往時那末濃地遮蓋了半個天。人也是那末懶散地帶着嘆息。墟市雖然還是照常着，可是趁墟的人是只有賣沒有買，平常日子更冷寂得可怕。這小地地方的頂出名的華洋雜貨店兼郵政代辦所的德記老字號，到這時候也不能不在門口「拍烏龜。」</p>
<p>老板陳老通是一個愛管閒事的和事老，他在這里也很有點權威。他靠着吃的雖然是開店，不過這幾年來田里收成不好也影響了他，使他不得不吃盡了臭霉頭。現在，他剛正在那里打瞌睡哩。</p>
<p>斜對門的一家酒舖里，又出現了那醉漢陳大牛了。他是一個剛給赶回來的華僑，他是一個年靑人，脾氣很壞，灌了幾口雙蒸酒便會忘了本性，終天在這里在那里嘩啦嘩啦呌。這時候他又喝醉了，迷糊了眼睛，一步一蹩地走到路上來。靠近德記雜貨店的櫃台，便用力一拍，陳老通是給嚇醒了，一條長長的口水還掛在嘴邊，很忿怒地瞪着這個不近人情的醉漢。</p>
<p>「老通，我信有嗎？從東京那兒來的？」</p>
<p>「呸！」這老頭子架上了老花眼鏡，一看又是那臭猪頭，撲頭地便吐了一大口濃痰。然後，帶點諷刺意味地說着：「你的信？」東京難道還要請你回去？好傢伙，舊金山請兩個担傘燈的契弟，你去不去？可憐你不是正光雅里貨哩！」（註）</p>
<p>話很象沒有裝進這醉漢的心里，他便是大搖大擺地在路上跟跟蹌蹌的走着。嘴巴里模糊地哼着那小孩子的山歌。</p>
<p>一會兒，小駁輪到岸的呌聲，嚇醒了這兒的人了。</p>
<p>德記雜貨店這時剎地熱閙起來了。幾個老鄉在那兒圍攏了陳老通，要他講新聞。於是，他稍為顯得興奮地在那兒指手劃脚的講着，穀價是怎樣的狂跌着，省城又閙什末風潮，蠻好看的鈔票不能用了，——十塊頭，一百塊頭也都成了廢物。</p>
<p>「那又是什末媽×的打仗了嗎？」一個年靑人在問着。</p>
<p>當然嘞！陳老通縐着了眉頭，「什末鬼傢伙打來了，聽說是打得我們都沒路走了，所以省城也起了風潮了。這個說打那個說不打，也許連人家還沒碰一下，自家兒便會打起來咧。這年頭兒是沒話講的呵！」</p>
<p>「是那帮禽獸一樣的爛契弟嗎？你媽個爛臭貨，我在他們那兒已吃够了他們的氣了，沒原沒故地便把人赶，這世界有什末道理好講，……」</p>
<p>人叢里嚮着大牛那粗嗓子，人們都不知道他是什末時候挿了進來的。</p>
<p>鄕下人總有點怕事，給他這末一駭，一個退一個地都走得淸光了。這兒，光剩下了他倆—老通沒了興緻，倒在那張竹床上，有神沒氣地在抽烟。這個鹵莽的漢子，都還在睜大了眼睛，象憤怒着什末似的。</p>
<p>陳家村又死寂地，懶洋洋地躺在那里，几家店舖透出了點兒炊烟，象是嘆息。</p>
<p>（註）這都是駡人的話，契弟是「兎子」的意思。俗傳光雅里担傘燈的都是契弟。</p>

<p>雲烟烟烟雲籠簾房。月濛濛濛月色昏黃。陰霾霾一座瀟湘館。寒凄凄幾扇碧紗窗。呼嘯嘯千箇琅玕竹。草靑靑數枝瘦海棠。病懨懨一位多愁女。冷淸淸兩個小梅香。只見他、薄囂囂囂薄羅衫薄。黃瘦瘦瘦黃花容黃。眼忪忪忪眼愁添懷。眉蹙蹙蹙眉恨滿腔。靜悄悄悄靜坐湘妃榻。軟綿綿軟靠象牙床。黯淡淡一盞殘燭淚。冷冰冰半杯煎藥湯。可憐他，氣喘喘。心蕩蕩。嗽聲聲。淚在在。血斑斑濕透了薄羅裳。情切切切情情忐忑嘆連連連嘆嘆凄凉。可憐奴，生離離離別故土後。孤棲棲棲跡寄他方。路迢迢雲程千里隔，白茫茫總望不到舊家鄕。虛縹縹只怕倒是黃泉近。倒不如，請求求早些去赴無常。你他，神惚惚萬念皆空虛。影單單諸事盡滄桑。。只見那，夜沉沉夜色多慘淡。聲寂寂聲息愁更長。只聽得，風颯颯颯風風凄凄。雨霏霏霏雨雨猛猛。滴呤呤銅壺漏不盡。打冷冷鐵馬嚮可噹。篤嚨矓風禁簾釣動。屑瀝瀝雨點打寒窗。可噹噹鐘聲敲三下。北鼕鼕焦樓打五更。那妃子是，冷颼颼冷風禁不起。夜漫漫夜雨愁斷腸。從此後，病汪汪病魔入膏肓。</p>

<h3>「中旅」的新戲「祖國」</h3>
<p>今日柬邀各界試演</p>
<p>唐槐秋氏領導的「中國旅行劇團」，前次在卡爾登演出，頗得好評，不過除了「雷雨」之外，其他的劇本如「少奶奶的扇子」「梅蘿香」等都太軟弱，唐槐秋也自認那是「技術上的樣品」。此次從南京歸來，特電請陳綿博士來滬排演新戲，第一砲的祖國」已排練成熟，今日下午二時半柬邀各界參觀。</p>
<p>「祖國」係法國作品，述十五六世紀時歐洲「勿拉芒」國亡國之慘史，已由北平中法大學敎授陳綿博士譯成「漢」文，全劇共五幕，演員約三四十人。</p>
<p>劇中有年老之愛國者李沙伯爵，（唐槐秋飾）因忙於國事，失去二十歲的少妻（唐若靑飾）的愛情，終因國事重大，不顧私情而為國捐軀。有凶暴毒辣而好殺的元帥，但他又是一個女兒的好父親。有因私情而出賣丈夫的淫婦，終究她也被情人所殺。有視死如歸的愛國靑年，有能殺十名敵軍的老嫗，有生性慈悲而弱不禁風的閨閣千金。</p>
<p>該劇結構異常緊凑，舞台面亦很活潑，佈景的偉人，台詞的鏗鏘，尤其餘事矣。</p>
<h3>女權的劇旨</h3>
<p>「女權」原名愛情的逃亡者，洪深所編，劇本曾在五月與六月號的文學上發表。主旨是鼓勵人生去與黑暗，惡勢力抗爭，奮鬥，不應當和它妥協；為它所屈服，同時，它又說明了抗爭與奮鬥，應當是理智的，有組織的，而不是一時情感的衝動，英雄主義的。「女權」就是寫一個女子在沒有理智，目標下與黑暗，惡勢抗爭，奮鬥的失敗，這是對目前一般徬徨在歧路上無目標奮鬥而失敗的靑年一個光明的啟示。洪深承認是他滿意的創作。導演張石川用更大的努力來處理它，無疑的，這是一部値得注意的片子。而演員的陣綫更是充實，由胡蝶主演，趙丹，龔稼農，梅熹，王獻齋，王徵信，嚴月閒，葉秋心，舒繡文，袁紹梅，陸露明等聯合演出。</p>

(Central News Agency dispatch from the 6th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) President of the Judicial Yuan Ju Zheng, Chief of General Staff Cheng Qian, and Director Zhu Peide issued the following joint statement to the Central News Agency reporter at noon on the 6th: "Zheng, Qian, and Peide, etc., were ordered to go to Guangxi this time to meet with Mr. Li Delin, Mr. Bai Jiansheng, and Mr. Huang Xuchu. After several sincere talks and observing the general situation in politics, military affairs, and society, we are convinced of the patriotic spirit of the Guangxi generals and their views on national defense, which are completely consistent with the Central Government's policy of saving the nation and seeking survival in recent years. In particular, Guangxi Province has made practical efforts and achieved results in the organization and training of the people. The patriotic enthusiasm of the military and civilians throughout the province and their unity are commendable. Since these talks, facts have been presented candidly, and with regard to the future of the country, it is generally believed that there is a need for sincere unity and unified political and military orders. Mr. Li and Mr. Bai have been consistently patriotic and loving the Party, and immediately expressed their support for unification and acceptance of orders. Their open and aboveboard attitude is truly admirable. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has particularly commended Mr. Li and Mr. Bai's opinions on saving the nation and has ordered the immediate commencement of the redeployment of troops in the West River and South Route. From now on, with sincere unity, under the overall command of the Central Government, we will work together to strive for the great cause of revolution and national salvation. The future of the country is full of hope. We are especially narrating the process, which will surely be welcomed by compatriots and comrades across the country." (Central News Agency dispatch from the 6th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek came to the province from Huangpu on the afternoon of the 5th and summoned Cheng Qian, Ju Zheng, Zhu Peide, etc., to discuss the response to the requests of Li and Bai. Therefore, the return of Liu Weizhang to Guangxi was delayed for one or two days. It is also rumored that Li and Bai recommended Li Jishen to come to Guangzhou to meet with Chiang Kai-shek for face-to-face discussions. (Special dispatch from the 6th)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Li Yangjing returned to the province from Hong Kong on the 4th to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for instructions and will go to Zhejiang at the end of the month to take office. (Special dispatch from the 6th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Today, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek spoke to the reporter of this agency at the Huangpu Military Academy. Chiang solemnly declared that Bai Chongxi had agreed to come to Guangzhou for a frank and thorough discussion of the situation in Guangxi, and said that he himself was most optimistic and that all the difficult problems concerning Guangxi Province could now be resolved without shedding a drop of blood. Chiang also stated that the entire situation in the Southwest would soon reach a state of stability, and he hoped to return to Nanjing with his wife in the shortest possible time. Chairman Chiang's health and spirit are both very robust, and he is extremely busy with official duties, working up to fourteen hours a day. The house in which Chiang now resides is built by the river, and the structure is very simple. Its location is below the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Monument and adjacent to the famous Huangpu Military Academy. At present, the school is about to become a branch of the Nanjing Central Military Academy. At the same time, the overall atmosphere in the Southwest is now very promising. It is widely believed that Chiang's tolerance will be rewarded, and the results of his meeting with Bai Chongxi will surely dispel previous personal grudges. It is said that Bai has accepted a high-ranking position in Nanjing. If this is the case, it will surely allow this capable revolutionary soldier to serve a unified China.

<h3>The Yongding River Experienced a Sudden Surge Yesterday, Water Level Exceeded the Highest Record in History, Over 30 Feet of the New Dike at Zhonghong Breached</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Lugouqiao telephone report: The Yongding River rose to seventeen feet on the 5th, and the water was surging. On the morning of the 6th, it rose to nineteen feet, breaking the highest record in history. The water was extremely turbulent, and the sound of the flow could be heard for several miles. This afternoon at 4:30 PM, the river water dropped by one foot, and the water level fell to eighteen feet. The Yongding River Affairs Bureau received a report from the Guanting Measurement Station in Huailai County that there was heavy rain upstream on the 5th, and the weather was still not clear on the 6th. The river water continued to rise sharply. The bureau rushed to transport sacks and lanterns, etc., and distributed them to various sections for use. It is expected that there will be another surge at midnight on the 6th and on the morning of the 7th, and it is estimated that the water level will exceed two zhang. According to Liu Yufu, the Director of the Yongding River Affairs Bureau, the river water rose sharply to nineteen feet today, and many sections have experienced landslides, creating a dangerous situation unprecedented in history. (Special dispatch from the 6th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 1:00 AM on the 6th, due to the sudden surge in the Yongding River and the narrow Zhonghong river channel, the newly built dike at Yangjiadi, Shuangkou Town, collapsed for more than 30 meters due to soft soil. More than ten villages on the left bank were submerged, and thousands of acres of farmland were destroyed. The River Bureau coordinated with more than 10,000 civilian laborers from Jingwu and Tianjin counties to be conscripted to construct the breach, and half of the breach had been completed by evening. However, the water depth at the breach was five feet, and the flow was still rapid, making it difficult to close. The River Bureau purchased 1,000 hemp bags from Tianjin. (Special dispatch from the 6th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Due to the heavy rain upstream on the 5th, the Yongding River surged. On the 6th, the flow at Lugouqiao was rapid, and the water level increased to nineteen feet. The River Bureau ordered laborers and river soldiers to guard the protective dikes. (Special dispatch from the 6th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Yongding River water level suddenly reached 119 feet at noon on the 6th, exceeding the highest water level record in history. According to the River Affairs Bureau, the reason for the flood was due to heavy rain upstream and the tail end of the Korean hurricane. Fortunately, the river defenses are solid, so there is no cause for concern. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 6th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a report received by the North China Water Conservancy Commission on the 6th, the Yongding River experienced a sudden surge due to continuous heavy rains and mountain floods upstream, with the water level in Chahar Guanting increasing by more than two zhang on the morning of the 6th. The torrential water flowed downstream and is expected to reach Lugouqiao on the evening of the 6th and the morning of the 7th. The water level there is currently 63.3 meters. If the water level continues to rise, disaster is inevitable. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 6th)</p>
<h3>The Crest of the Flood in the Yellow River in Henan Passes Through the Middle Reaches Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Kaifeng) At 2:00 PM on the 6th, the water level at Tongguan was 323.11 meters, and the flow rate was 7500 cubic meters per second. There was a major flood in Shanzhou on the 5th. At 8:00 AM on the 6th, it passed Zhongmu, and at 12:00 PM, it passed Bian, and is expected to leave Henan in the evening. Dikes upstream and downstream of Henan are in danger. Wang Liren, the Director of the River Bureau, returned to Bian at 11:00 PM on the 5th and then went to inspect the Rongze Min Dike on the south bank at 5:00 AM on the 6th. Kong Xiangrong departed from Dongzhuang and went west, and Wang Yujun also went to Liuyuankou to investigate. Personnel from various river defense agencies also worked as hard on the night of the 6th as they did on the 5th. (Special dispatch from the 6th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The crest of the flood in Shanzhou reached Dongzhuang tonight, raising the water level by five inches, with a water level of 57.9 meters. (Special dispatch from the 6th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The floodwaters in Shanzhou gradually receded on the evening of the 5th. The crest of the flood passed through Zhongmu today, and the flow rate was reduced to 11,600 cubic meters per second. It is expected to enter Shandong Province at dawn on the 7th. The Director of the River Bureau, Wang Kai, is now inspecting the upstream areas along the river. According to people familiar with river works, the dikes in Shandong are still solid. If the water level at Li Shengcun rises to 59 meters and the water level at Luokou rises to 31.5 meters, it may be safe to flow through the center of the river. However, if the flow pattern changes, there may be accidents. The dikes downstream are low and will definitely overflow, but it does not matter. Zhao Jiaba in the lower reaches of Changqing Wulongtan and Fenglou in the divided section of Jibei are all cause for concern. The cloudy and rainy weather today may cause the water to continue to rise. (Special dispatch from the 6th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) There was a storm in Shanhaiguan on the 4th, and mountain torrents rushed down from Mount Jiao. The Shi River swelled due to the inflow of water, and the city moat also breached. The water depth in the city's south gate was five feet, and the south gate street and the station were three to four feet deep. The Shanhaiguan Gazette and the Puppet Customs Building were trapped in the water, like islands. Business and transportation were suspended.

<h3>Simplified Measures for Compulsory Enforcement Law to be Reviewed by the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding mortgagees whose debts have reached maturity and have not been repaid, when petitioning the court to auction off their mortgaged property in accordance with the auction procedure, the Compulsory Enforcement Law passed by the Legislative Yuan stipulates that the court must first review the case to issue an order permitting its enforcement. Although appeals can be made against this order, compulsory enforcement will not be suspended as a result. The Ministry of Finance believes that this type of regulation is quite prudent, but recently, in order to facilitate financial circulation, the industrial and commercial sectors are extremely willing for mortgaged property to be auctioned off quickly. Therefore, they believe that the enforcement measures should still be revised to be more simplified to meet social needs. They have signed opinions and presented them to the Executive Yuan for review by the Central Political Council. It is now learned that the Central Political Council has decided to hand the case over to the Legislative Yuan. The Civil Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to meet for review within days. Once the review is completed and submitted to the Yuan Committee for approval, it will be sent to the National Government for promulgation and implementation. It is also learned that the real estate mortgage loan bank to be established by the China Construction Bank under the order of the Ministry of Finance will only be formally established and begin issuing loans after the law is promulgated by the National Government.

<h3>The British New Ambassador to China Visits Japan</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>The new British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, came to China to take office this time. He detoured through Canada and Washington, arriving in Tokyo the day before yesterday. According to the report by the same league, before departing, Sir Kerr had talked with Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the economic envoy who had returned from China. He also met with Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Yoshida, and frankly exchanged opinions on Sino-Japanese relations and the relationship between Britain and Japan centered on China. Although the foreign report is brief, we can easily see the dynamics of the relationship between Britain and Japan and the importance of this visit to Japan by the new British Ambassador to China.</p>
<p>A newly appointed ambassador to China, even before taking office, started Sino-Japanese negotiations with emphasis on China. In terms of diplomatic convention, it is a fact that exceeds the norm. However, according to the current international situation, we feel that Britain and Japan have common needs, which is not surprising. Because for Britain and Japan, if they want to relive their old dreams and pursue a compromise, the current is indeed an excellent opportunity.</p>
<p>First, in terms of relations with China, the current is an important key for Britain and Japan to redetermine their coordination policies. Now the problems in Guangdong and Guangxi have been smoothly resolved, and the unification of China is gradually being completed. Sino-Japanese diplomacy will unfold a new path. And the conflicting interests of Britain and Japan in China, in accordance with the development of this new situation, are becoming increasingly superficial, and of course, the need for adjustment is increasingly felt.</p>
<p>Second, the rumored Sino-Japanese negotiations may not have started yet, but they will soon become a reality. How Sino-Japanese relations evolve will also determine their future development in this negotiation. Of course, before finding a common negotiation premise for Sino-Japanese problems, Britain's interests are the first facts that cannot be ignored. Therefore, before concrete Sino-Japanese negotiations begin, it is necessary for Britain and Japan to exchange opinions and seek a compromise approach.</p>
<p>Third, in addition to relations centered on China, the general shift in the international situation is also an important factor in determining the recent development of British-Japanese relations. The crisis of the fascistization of Spain makes Britain's peace diplomacy with Europe even more thorny. Therefore, its attitude towards Japan has had to tend towards compromise. At the same time, Japan has also broken its five-year record in foreign trade recently, and is holding great concerns for the future development of the world market. Manchuria is neither its ideal paradise, nor is it easy to realize the monopoly of East Asia. Then, realizing a plan of piecemeal disintegration and gradual expansion through the Anglo-Japanese compromise is also something Japan is willing to consider.</p>
<p>Based on such common needs, the voice of an Anglo-Japanese compromise has been intermittently revealing itself in recent months. At the beginning of last month, Tokyo published the Anglo-Japanese compromise plan formulated by Hoare, part of which said that Britain recognizes "Manchukuo" and respects Japan's special position in North China. Japan, in turn, reiterated its respect for China's territorial "integrity" and the Open Door Policy, and respect for Britain's vested interests in China. Although this rumor was denied by the London authorities, it caused considerable excitement in British public opinion for a time. There is no smoke without fire, and there is probably a reason for it. And the activities of people from Japan's diplomatic and business circles toward Britain have not ceased to this day. The voice of calling an Anglo-Japanese economic conference was first proposed by Japan.</p>
<p>Sir Archibald Clark Kerr's visit to Japan, with Sino-Japanese diplomacy as the center, is conducting compromise negotiations between Britain and Japan. Although it is not easy to be optimistic about the results, based on local common needs, the two countries do have an objective basis for reaching an understanding. We hope that Britain and Japan will both abide by the iron rule that "China's territory is complete and China's independent sovereignty is sacred and inviolable" to seek permanent peace in international relations in the Far East.</p>
<h3>Agreement Draft for Exchange of Postal Packages Between China and the Soviet Union Under Review</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The draft agreement for the direct exchange of packages between China and the Soviet Union's postal services has been approved by the Executive Yuan and is being sent to the Legislative Yuan for review. The motion for the exchange of packages between China and the Soviet Union has been around for a long time, but it was suspended due to the political change in the Soviet Union in the 7th year of the Republic of China. Recently, the Soviet Ambassador to China sent personnel to negotiate with the General Directorate of Posts of China, wishing to sign the agreement in Nanjing in the name of the postal authorities of both parties, with Mr. Ramer, First Secretary of the Embassy, representing the Soviet People's Committee for Postal Affairs, and the General Directorate of Posts of China. The draft agreement was negotiated, and its content is generally the same as the principles of the International Postal Parcel Agreement, with no special preferences.

<h3>Correcting Names of Trade Unions in Various Places</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industry believes that the names of trade unions in various places are ambiguous and difficult to understand due to the use of local dialects, making it difficult to review them.

<h3>World Peace Movement Conference Issues Declaration Urging Global National Spirit Solidarity Viewing Aggressor Nations as Enemies of Peace</h3>
<p>Brussels The World Peace Movement Conference continued its meeting yesterday. Lord Cecil of Britain, Lord Lytton (former Governor-General of India and Chairman of the League of Nations Manchuria Investigation Team), and French Communist Senator Cachin successively delivered speeches. Subsequently, a declaration was passed to conclude the conference. It stated, "People of all countries must maintain peace with the spirit of warriors. The conference hereby sincerely appeals to the people of all countries to participate in this great movement. This movement does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Its sole purpose is that all nations in the world, regardless of strength or weakness, should share the joy of peace under conditions of complete equality. If a country goes against international law and engages in aggression, thereby disrupting world peace, then we should regard it as the sole enemy." It is said that before the meeting, a British woman named Fan La, wearing a blue dress, broke into the venue, claiming to be a representative of the World Mothers Association, holding a self-made "international flag," calling it the great invention of the present age. The police at the venue immediately expelled her from the venue, ending the disturbance. It was also an interesting episode. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>New British Ambassador to China Will Visit Japanese Foreign Minister Tomorrow To Exchange Views on China Issues</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Following Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the new British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, recently went to Nanjing to take up his new post via Tokyo. Yesterday, he and his family arrived at the British Ambassador's villa in Lake Chuzenji to rest. He is scheduled to enter Tokyo on the 8th with Ambassador Craigie to attend a welcome luncheon hosted by Foreign Minister Arita. Before departing from his home country, Ambassador Clark Kerr had already met with Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, head of the economic mission to China, and Ambassador Yoshida to the UK, and frankly exchanged views on the current state of Sino-Japanese relations and the future of Anglo-Japanese relations centered on China. Foreign Minister Arita took advantage of the ambassador's visit to Japan to thoroughly explain Japan's position and the current state of Anglo-Japanese relations in East Asia. Therefore, on that day, he will exchange views with Ambassadors Clark Kerr and Craigie before the luncheon begins. On that day, Prince Matsudaira, Minister Hayashi Gonsuke and others will also be present. (Domei, 6th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Sixty-Year-Old Man Invents Spider Web-Style Shell; Only Weapon for Air Defense</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese scholar Masakichi Shiya (64) recently invented a spider web-style shell, which uses raw silk as raw material, processed and manufactured and loaded into the shell. It can sweep across 1,000 meters to supplement the shortcomings of anti-aircraft guns, making it impossible for airplanes to exert their bombing function and be manipulated freely, with great effectiveness. Public testing is scheduled for the beginning of next month. The Ministry of the Army attaches great importance to this invention. (China United Press, 6th)</p>

<h3>Spanish Rebel Army Takes Advantage of Victory to Advance on San Sebastián; Advances Along Highway Under Intense Artillery Fire; Government Troops Achieve Victory in Counterattack Southwest of Capital</h3>
<p>Andaye This correspondent reports especially that the Spanish Northern Nationalist Army is currently launching a fierce attack on the port of San Sebastián. Although they advanced at dawn today, the government troops occupy the Torreng Mountain fort, which is very solid in its form, and its artillery fire is particularly fierce. The Nationalist Army forces have therefore been unable to drive straight in, and are only slowly advancing along the highway near the outskirts of San Sebastián under the artillery fire. It is expected that this highway will soon be occupied, as Nationalist Army transport vehicles, artillery units, and machine gun vehicles have been seen continuously on the road since 1:30 PM. Although the Guadalupe Fort is silent, the Nationalist Army authorities are still afraid that the government troops have placed landmines during their retreat, and they dare not occupy it directly. At this moment, they are still bombarding it from a distance, but the firing of cannons is very sparse. In addition, the French consulate in Irún has neither been burned nor hit by bullets. All forty French nationals living inside the consulate are safe and sound. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Hendaye It has been learned here that several teams of rebel soldiers have surrounded San Sebastián today. After about two hours of fighting in the Irún area, the rebel soldiers occupied Fuenterrabía and the Guadalupe Fort, and took advantage of the victory to advance directly to the northwest to join forces and attack San Sebastián. Whether the rebel prisoners of war in the Guadalupe Fort will be killed is still unknown today. (National News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Irún A spokesperson for the rebel soldiers here stated today, "The cruiser 'España' has begun to fiercely attack the government military camps in San Sebastián. Women there are holding their young children, pleading with the government troops to surrender in order to avoid a massacre similar to that when Irún fell." (National News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Madrid The rebel army advancing on Madrid from the southwest was met with a fierce counterattack by government forces in Talavera de la Reina and Torrijos, 80 miles from the capital. They were forced to retreat along the 12-mile-wide front line they had occupied the previous day. This attack by the government forces was assisted by a strong artillery unit and seven tri-engine bombers, as well as several fighter planes. Spanish President Azaña then arrived at the Talavera de la Reina front line and was warmly welcomed by the soldiers and civilians. All the residents who had fled the town have now returned to their former residences. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Madrid The government has just released a war report stating that in the Talavera de la Reina area southwest of the capital, the rebel army assembled its elite troops at dawn yesterday and attacked the government forces. However, General Asensio led his troops to counterattack and used airplanes to assist in the battle, and finally drove the rebel army back 20 kilometers, seizing a large number of military weapons and capturing many prisoners. The rebel army in the Talavera de la Reina area has now been completely blocked and cannot advance. The government military headquarters is preparing to launch a large-scale offensive in order to eliminate the rebel army. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Port of San Sebastián After the Spanish rebel army captured the city of Irún, they have the potential to invade the port of San Sebastián. Therefore, the residents here have been fleeing to France. Today, 50 residents, including several women, took a small motorboat to France. There are also many small boats carrying a large number of civilians and luggage. Due to the rain and heavy wind and waves in the sea, they are temporarily anchored here waiting for departure. Looking across the sea, thick black smoke is rising from the city of Fuenterrabía, mixed with the smoke from the embers of Irún, forming a vast expanse. The rebel army will surely occupy the city of Fuenterrabía within a few hours. A hundred members of the government army's militia from Irún came here, requesting the authorities to allow them to go to Fuenterrabía to enlist. Several of them swam to the opposite shore of Fuenterrabía, regardless of the heavy wind and waves in the sea. It is reported that the commander of the rebel column who occupied Irún yesterday, Beorlegi, was wounded in the foot by a bullet. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>Northern Towns Fall in Succession; Rebel Army's Momentum Grows Daily; Fuenterrabía Also Occupied</h3>
<p>Hendaye This correspondent reports especially that three members of the Spanish Popular Front militia escaped from the Guadalupe Fort in that country last night on a small boat and arrived in France. It is claimed that the Nationalist Army did indeed capture the town of Fuenterrabía at 10:00 PM last night without resistance. As for the garrison of 200 officers and men at the Guadalupe Fort, most of them have fled into the mountains, and the fort has also been occupied by the Nationalist Army. Fire was opened in the vicinity of the port of San Sebastián last night. The government artillery unit is firing artillery shells at the Nationalist Army positions in the Hejinar area. The two armies are only 7 kilometers apart. As far as is generally known, the Nationalist Army in the province of Gipuzkoa has recently transferred reinforcements from Pamplona in the province of Navarre. The total strength of the army is no less than 6,000 officers and men. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Hendaye At 11:50 PM tonight, the rebel army had surrounded Fuenterrabía and the Guadalupe Fort. The two places are feared to be indefensible. Around 11:00 PM, Fuenterrabía was on fire. Three places in the city caught fire, but the fire did not spread throughout the city, because it was raining heavily at the time. At 10:00 PM tonight, more than a hundred members of the government army's militia arrived here by boat. According to their claims, there are currently no residents in Fuenterrabía. However, there are still some militia in the city guarding it, preparing to fight to the end. At dusk today, the bells of the Irún Cathedral rang loudly, presumably because the cathedral had not been burned down, so the bells were rung to celebrate the rebel army's victory. (National News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Hendaye This correspondent reports especially that the Guadalupe Fort near the Spanish city of Irún, which was originally thought by most people to have been abandoned by the government troops last night, suddenly opened fire on the rebel army in Irún at 8:00 AM this morning. It is expected that the rebel army in the city will quickly divide its troops and attack in order to avoid future troubles. As for the towns of Irún, Behobia, and Fuenterrabía, they have been extremely quiet since they were captured by the rebel army. Of the original 6,000 officers and men of the rebel army on the front line in the province of Gipuzkoa, only 500 to 600 are stationed in each of these towns. Their main force opened to the outskirts of the port of San Sebastián yesterday. It is the general opinion that the rebel army will soon attack the port, as it is expected that the government troops in the ports of Pasaia and Lezo near the port will not resist fiercely, so the rebel army can take the opportunity to take them in one go. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Hendaye This correspondent reports especially that the Guadalupe Fort in northern Spain stopped shelling the Nationalist Army in Irún at noon today, after resuming artillery fire at 8:00 AM this morning. It is clear that the Nationalist Army has completely occupied the fort. There is little doubt about it. As for the leader of the Nationalist Army in the town of Fuenterrabía, he sent teams out to patrol all night, and no houses in the town were destroyed, so the market was quite quiet. When the government troops abandoned the town, they threw many trucks into the sea. The Nationalist Army authorities are currently supervising their subordinates to find ways to salvage them. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Irún Embers Have Not Died Out; Scene of Utter Desolation; Rebel Army Celebrates Victory</h3>
<p>Hendaye The fall of Irún will allow the rebel army to drive straight to San Sebastián, and at the same time, it can cut off the government army's supply from Barcelona. Today, when the rebel army was carrying out the final mopping up of enemy soldiers in Irún, they killed 13 defending soldiers. The rebel soldiers are now dancing wildly and cheering, celebrating this victory, repeatedly shouting slogans such as "Long live Spain!" Irún is still shrouded in thick smoke, but the small golden-red flag has been waving among the houses in the city. When the correspondents of various newspapers were allowed to pass through the international bridge, many soldiers under General Mola, the commander of the Northern Rebel Army, saluted them in the fascist style. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Andaye, Southern France This correspondent issued a report from the international bridge bordering Irún and France, describing the situation in the first few minutes after the fall of Irún, and the jubilation of the rebel army after their victory as follows:</p>
<p>When Irún was captured, the fire in the city had not been extinguished, but the red, yellow, and red national flags of the monarchical era had been hung everywhere on the black city walls. Several fascist groups are patrolling the streets, searching for hidden soldiers. From the end of the bridge to the city, there are French and other foreign journalists and cinematographers filming along the way. They were allowed by the French authorities to pass through the border. When they arrived at the end of the bridge, the troops of General Mola guarding the bridge stood at attention and saluted with their guns to show their might. When the cameramen started filming, the soldiers rushed to the front of the camera in order to be included in the film. Although the soldiers had been fighting for a long time, they did not seem tired. The "France Avenue" leading to Irún was crowded with troops, including troops from the Carlist restoration party, all wearing red Spanish hats, and carrying machine guns and tanks. They cheered each other, patted each other on the shoulders, and hugged each other to express their joy. Among the houses along the street, some have not been burned down, but only the four walls remain dilapidated. The storefront windows have no glass, and the doors have been removed. The walls are full of bullet marks, and chickens, pigs, and livestock roam freely in the gardens, unattended. "Columbus Road" was once the prosperous street of Irún, but now it is a scene of utter desolation. The houses on both sides are still burning, and thick smoke is rising everywhere. Gunfire can still be heard on the street from time to time. When the correspondent passed by, a cannonball suddenly flew over his head, whizzing past, which was fired by the rebel army from the town of Behobia and aimed at Fuenterrabía and Guadalupe. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Andaye The embers of Irún have not been extinguished, and there are still more than a hundred places burning in the entire city. It is expected that the fire will take several days to extinguish. It is reported that more than a dozen French men and women are still trapped in the ashes of Irún. Most of them are French citizens who have married Spanish women. They have been taking refuge in the French consulate for several days and cannot go out. They are now begging the French authorities for help. In addition to the French citizens in the consulate, it is reported that there is still a French doctor who stayed in the city and did not leave when the rebel army entered the city. According to investigations, Irún has a total population of 12,000 residents, but only 5,000 have taken refuge in France. The whereabouts of the remaining 7,000 are unknown. Most of them have fled to the port of San Sebastián. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>Mallorca Expedition Ordered to Retreat</h3>
<p>Barcelona According to a public announcement released by the Catalan government, the expeditionary force loyal to the government has been ordered by the Spanish government to retreat from Mallorca, the largest of the Balearic Islands, and re-embark on ships. No one was sacrificed. It is reported that the Madrid government never advocated sending troops to attack the island. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>Rebel Army in Alcázar Besieged</h3>
<p>Madrid Government troops in Toledo have launched a final offensive against the besieged rebel army in the Alcázar since last night. It is expected that the rebel army will be exhausted and will surrender by noon today. When the government troops began their offensive, a specially dispatched correspondent of this agency witnessed the event and personally saw the rebel army's garrison headquarters (similar to the Alcázar) first being destroyed by the government troops. The rebel army then escaped to the Alcázar through underground passages. The government troops then shelled the palace continuously, destroying two observation towers on the left and right one after another. They also sent troops to throw grenades into the palace. A large fire once broke out in the palace and was extinguished, but thick smoke filled the air, suffocating the rebel army. The rebel army probably lacks bullets and has not opened fire with rifles, machine guns, or mortars in recent days. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Burgos According to a special correspondent of this agency, the Nationalist Army trapped in the Alcázar in Toledo has one powerful radio transmitter and receiver, which they usually use to communicate with various places and compile a daily newspaper based on the information they obtain. Burgos also learned yesterday through radio that the soldiers and civilians trapped in the Alcázar held a celebration in the palace upon hearing that the Nationalist Army had won in the Irún area, and many young soldiers swore that they would rather "die for the glory of Spain."

<h3>Bomb on Rebel Train</h3>
<p>Madrid The militia belonging to the government troops in the southern port of Málaga recently sent a team of militiamen led by García, a young man of only 19 years old, to patrol the nearby area. García learned that a rebel train was advancing towards the city of Granada. He placed a bomb on a bridge and led the militiamen to ambush the bridge. Before long, the train drove over the bridge and triggered the bomb, causing it to overturn. Rebel soldiers were blown to pieces in the train. Those who survived were killed by the militiamen with hand grenades. García was only wounded in the abdomen and was immediately transported back to Málaga for treatment. He eventually died of his injuries. The government troops all regarded García's actions as heroic and praised him incessantly. (Havas, 6th)</p>

According to semi-official sources, the government will issue a declaration to confirm Germany's attitude towards this matter. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) The UK government has not yet received replies from the German and Portuguese governments approving the establishment of an international committee to handle all disputes arising from the non-intervention agreement in the Spanish civil war. The UK government has explained the nature and scope of the committee's powers to the two governments in detail and expects to be satisfied. Therefore, the UK government still hopes that the committee will be established immediately and convene in London at the beginning of next week. (Reuters, 5th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The delegation from Syria and Lebanon, formerly entrusted to France by the League of Nations, came to France to negotiate with the French foreign authorities in order to emulate the example of Iraq, formerly entrusted to the United Kingdom, so that the two regions could break away from French trusteeship and become independent countries. This negotiation has achieved results. France and Syria will formally sign a treaty on the 9th of this month, stipulating a period of three years for Syria to break away from French trusteeship and join the League of Nations as a member state.

<h3>Spain and the Revolution (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— By Ilya Ehrenburg, Translated by Bin Fu</p>
<p>After visiting Spain in 1931, I wrote the following:</p>
<p>"Spain has everything that 'visionary' people could wish for, yet unfortunately, they do not understand their own country. They live in dark and desolate forests, rarely thinking about their right to exist. The starving villages are full of peasants who eat acorns to survive. Corruption, backwardness, and diseases like typhoid and malaria are rampant. There are all kinds of punishments and countless prisons, resembling medieval dungeons…</p>
<p>"Since the revolution, thousands of streets in Spain have been renamed. The entire country has undergone a baptism. That feudal, bourgeois kingdom—that legacy of bureaucrats, landlords, counts, swindlers, and executioners—is now respectfully called the 'Republic of the Working Masses.'</p>
<p>"But the Civil Guard—40,000 men in tricorn hats—is still practicing target shooting, preparing for a grand shooting event.</p>
<p>"Yes, Spain is not famous for 'Carmen,' nor for the novels of Blasco Ibáñez (1867-1928); not for the diplomacy of Alejandro Lerroux, nor for the wine of the South. Twenty million ragged 'Don Quixotes,' desolate cliffs, profound sins, songs as mournful as the rustling of olive leaves, the roars of heroic strikers, pity, and sympathy—this is the true Spain. Spain has been on a secluded side road for far too long. She has spoken to the fantasies of dreamers with pride, ignorance, and loneliness for far too long. Now, the Spanish nation has gained the desire to live; the country has joined the world of labor, struggle, and hatred."</p>
<p>When the translation of my book was published there, it aroused the indignation of the Republican newspapers. One of them even demanded diplomatic protests to prohibit the spread of such "false" reports abroad. But during my recent trip to Spain, I met the representative of this newspaper. He sighed and said to me, "Unfortunately, your words were true."</p>
<p>On the surface, the country seems unchanged. Caballero's sons still flock to Alcalá. If you question them, they will proudly tell you that they are individualists. Idle people, as before, sit in cafes from morning till night. They talk about politics, listlessly closing their eyes while shoe shiners brush their shiny shoes. The noble bourgeoisie can be seen from the club windows. Old women still crowd the aisles of churches. Well-dressed young women kiss the hands of plump bishops. Monks drink wine in "salons" and touch women's buttocks.</p>
<p>During the Christmas holidays, dozens of solemnly dressed "Madonnas" parade through the streets of Seville. Express trains bring pious Caballero supporters from Madrid. Upon arriving at the hotel, they take off their secular clothes and put on the garb of "penitent Christians." Although the elections have brought new results, the Madonna still receives a brand-new canopy over the altar this year—a gift from the women of Madrid, who donate two pounds of silver each month.</p>
<p>On the front page of El Liberal, one can read articles about the "noble morals of workers," but on the last page, there are a dozen advertisements that read: "Comrades of Caballero: Don't forget to visit Mrs. Rita's salon. Beautiful girls, blonde, brunette, and foreign girls."</p>
<p>The same skyscrapers, the same huts, the same poverty. Farmers still use plows from prehistoric times. Girls carry heavy water jugs on their heads. Workers drink water-like soup, and peasants can only dream of even that. The children on the streets are ragged, barefoot, and forgotten. Getting into a school is harder than winning the lottery—simply because there are too many children and too few schools. Life is hard and cruel, like the rocks on the Castilian plain…</p>
<p>The same tricorn hats. Like the "horrors" painted by Goya, they lurk in the alleys, among the olive trees, among the children. They remind people of executions in the fields of Extremadura, of exposed corpses, of weeping women, of starving children…</p>
<p>In Segovia, fascists shouted, "Down with Azaña, wake up, Spain!" Workers tried to disperse the fascists. The Civil Guard began shooting at the workers. Did those killers in tricorn hats care that the current Prime Minister of Spain was Azaña? They only knew one thing: the gun should only point at the workers, not at the respectable brothers of Caballero. On April 14, a Civil Guard officer attempted to assassinate Azaña. This unsuccessful assassin was shot in the melee. During his funeral, the Civil Guard officers walked and shouted slogans: "Long live the Civil Guard!"</p>
<p>The president has changed, but the head of the presidential guard, Batet—the one who "pacified" the Catalan rebellion in October 1934—has not been dismissed. The police still keep a list of "traitors." On that stained, tattered card, the names of those who rebelled against the monarchy and the Lerroux and Robles governments are recorded. Several names on the card are now ministers, but in the eyes of the police, they are still considered dangerous "traitors."</p>
<p>A strike of metallurgical workers occurred in Barcelona. The police searched the union and arrested eighty workers. The Catalan government was embarrassed and ordered the police to release the workers. The police reluctantly complied. But a few days later, they searched the union again and arrested one hundred and twenty people.</p>
<p>How to interpret this action? This is no longer a political issue but simply a conditioned reflex—loyalty to old habits.</p>
<p>A high-ranking official in Barcelona today once belonged to the "Patriotic Union," the fascist organization of General Rivera. This organization often used the initials U.P. as its signature. But today, the walls of Barcelona houses are painted with the three letters U.H.P.—meaning "Unions Hermanos Proletarios" (Union of Proletarian Brothers, the slogan of the Asturian revolutionaries). Recently, a satirical magazine ridiculed him for this. It depicted him facing a wall painted with the three letters "U.H.P." and saying, "Strange, when I was in charge, there was no 'H' in the middle." The magazine was confiscated, so the high-ranking official was spared any damage to his "reputation."</p>
<p>In Madrid, the fascists who attacked the residence of the socialist leader Caballero were being interrogated. They were sentenced to fines of five to fifty "pesetas" (a Spanish currency). The same court had previously tried the socialist Solero Feito. Feito had not attacked anyone; he was only guilty of carrying a handgun. However, he was sentenced to four years in prison.</p>
<p>The same laws, the same judges, the same jailers. Yet Spain is no longer the same.</p>

<h3>France Pursues Non-Intervention Policy in Spanish Civil War; Germany Extends Conscription Due to Perceived Threat, Resolves to Enhance Armaments and Strengthen National Defense</h3>
<p>(Paris) The cabinet held a meeting this afternoon to discuss the situation in Spain. It was decided that France would continue to support the non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, which it initiated on August 8th. Furthermore, as the International Adjustment Committee is scheduled to open in London on Tuesday (September 8th), instructions will be drafted and sent to the French Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Corbin, for guidance when attending the meeting. The cabinet then discussed the situation resulting from Germany's extension of military service. It was decided that the country's military service term (currently two years) need not be extended, but existing armaments should be improved technically, such as (1) increasing ammunition reserves, (2) accelerating the mechanization of the army, (3) expanding the air force, (4) purchasing gas masks, (5) strengthening border defenses, and (6) recruiting technical personnel. It is now reported that the government will issue an appeal to all countries to cease the arms race. The next cabinet meeting is scheduled for Friday (September 11th). (Havas Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) During yesterday's cabinet meeting, it was decided to continue the policy of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. Upon hearing this news, the Communist Party and the General Confederation of Labor sent a delegation to Premier Blum, requesting that the ban on the transport of arms to Spain be lifted, and stating that the metallurgical employers had not strictly adhered to the various constraints previously accepted (referring to the agreement reached between labor and management in June to resolve the labor dispute). Therefore, the workers in the factories of the industry will go on strike for one hour on Monday (September 7th) to protest. The Premier replied that the government had already met the various demands previously made by the working class, and that it should not strike again. Moreover, in order to strengthen national defense, the government urgently needs ordnance, and the strike will only delay the manufacturing of ordnance and hinder the progress of national defense, which is not what the workers should do. For the sake of the General Confederation of Labor, it would be better to submit its views to the government for handling, which would be more appropriate. As for the Spanish event, the government has long decided to adopt a policy of non-intervention, and it is difficult to abandon it at this time. The request to lift the ban cannot be granted.

<h3>British Left-Wing Group Representatives Go to France to Inquire About Stance on Spain</h3>

<h3>German Newspaper Ridicules French Hypocritical Neutrality</h3>
<p>(Rome) The local newspapers are all pleased with the Spanish Nationalist Army's capture of Irún. They also reprint various reports from certain French newspapers about the country's aid to the Spanish Popular Front government. For example, the semi-official Stampa newspaper cited them to accuse France of maintaining "hypocritical neutrality." The Tribune headlined "The Farce of So-Called Neutrality." The Fascist Work newspaper said, "The non-intervention agreement has now been clearly broken." (Havas Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>French Morocco Sympathizes With the Spanish Government's Resistance</h3>
<p>Rabat, French Morocco, North Africa: The Sultan of Morocco (French protectorate) recently issued a declaration to the French Resident-General, Bellot, regarding the Spanish Civil War, stating: "Spain is our friendly nation. According to current international treaties, its influence extends to a part of Africa, our country, and its government maintains close ties with us. Now, a civil war has broken out within its borders, and the rebels intend to overthrow the government. We are saddened that a few of our citizens are willing to serve the rebels." It also stated, "The autonomous rights enjoyed by Morocco are guaranteed by current international treaties, and we are confident that the French government will protect them."

<h3>Poland Expands Armaments, France Promises Financial Aid; Polish Army Inspector-General Returns Home Yesterday, Details Await Expert Consultation</h3>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Delbos hosted a banquet for Polish Army Inspector-General, General Rydz-Śmigły, this afternoon. In the afternoon, Premier Blum, Defense Minister Daladier, and Naval Minister Gasnier jointly visited Rydz-Śmigły. In the evening, Polish Ambassador Łukasiewicz hosted a dinner for Rydz-Śmigły, inviting French and Polish dignitaries to attend. Rydz-Śmigły is scheduled to return home tomorrow. He consulted with the French authorities on France granting a loan to Poland to purchase ordnance from France and modernize the Polish army. After his return, financial and military experts from France and Poland will continue these negotiations. According to responsible sources, the French government has expressed agreement in principle to grant the loan, and only the details remain to be negotiated. Observers believe that Germany has recently restored its pre-war military strength, which has changed the international situation. General Rydz-Śmigły's visit is intended to revise the original Franco-Polish alliance to adapt to this new situation. (Havas Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister Receives Envoys of Little Entente Nations, Notifies Them of Results of Franco-Polish Talks</h3>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Delbos received British Ambassador Sir Clark, Czech Minister Osuský, Romanian Minister Cesiano, and Yugoslav Minister Brile earlier today for talks. It is generally believed that the purpose of this move is to inform the envoys of the negotiations between the French and Polish authorities since the arrival of Polish Army Inspector-General Rydz-Śmigły in France, in order to coordinate with them. According to responsible sources, agreement has been reached in principle regarding France's financial assistance to Poland to strengthen national defense. Only the details remain to be negotiated. However, French traditional policy has always advocated general arms limitation and supervision of its implementation. Since Germany has continued to expand its armaments on a large scale, the need to implement this French policy is even more urgent. However, it would be wrong to say that France's assistance to Poland in strengthening national defense is a sign of abandoning this policy, as France is expected to make new proposals on arms limitation soon.

<h3>Situation in Palestine Deteriorates Further; Prominent Arab Leader Suddenly Arrives in Jerusalem; Anti-Jewish Actions to Resume</h3>
<p>Jerusalem: Just as the British government decided to send the 1st Division to reinforce the eleven British garrison battalions already stationed here, the prominent Arab rebel leader, Fawzi al-Qawuqji, suddenly arrived. Therefore, it is generally expected that a period of terror is about to arrive in Palestine. Since last week, the increase in terrorism and the large number of British casualties are unprecedented since the disturbances began. However, there is still hope that the Arab strike will end once news of the British government's decision to take strict measures arrives. It is reported that the Arabs' attitude is quite strong. Fawzi al-Qawuqji, the leader of the Syrian rebels years ago, issued a public notice after arriving in Palestine, asking all Arabs to prepare to arm themselves, and signing himself "Leader of the Arab Revolution in Southern Syria (i.e., Palestine)" after the notice. It is rumored that Fawzi al-Qawuqji's reputation has attracted a large number of Arab villagers, making them feel bolder and fearing that these Arab villagers may attempt to besiege Jewish settlements, unlike before when they only dared to shoot from afar.

<h3>British Female Aviator Crosses the Atlantic, Sets New Record, Lands on Cape Breton Island Due to Fuel Exhaustion, Aircraft Damaged, Lady Only Slightly Injured in the Face</h3>
<p>Louisbourg, Nova Scotia: Mrs. Markham, who set a new record for crossing the Atlantic, was forced to land in a field in Baleine Cove, on the northern tip of Cape Breton Island, this afternoon. The aircraft was severely damaged, but she only suffered a few abrasions on her face. Mrs. Markham crawled out of the aircraft and walked to a nearby farm, from where she telephoned the Aero Club in Sydney, Nova Scotia, to inform them of her safety and request a car. The Club sent an aircraft to take her to Sydney if possible. The unexpected mishap was caused by the aircraft running out of fuel, greatly disappointing the crowd gathered at the Pennant Point aerodrome in Newfoundland to welcome her. However, a newspaper plane, waiting for Mrs. Markham's arrival, flew to the New England coast to take Mrs. Markham first to Nova Scotia and then to New York. Mrs. Markham spoke to her New York representative, Mr. Bruno, on the telephone, saying that she was very disappointed that she could not reach her destination. Since her departure, she had encountered heavy fog and storms, so she had been flying blind throughout. When she flew over Cape Breton Island, she ran out of fuel, and there was hardly any fuel left when she landed. According to New York meteorologists, Mrs. Markham must have lost the tailwind shortly after leaving Ireland and fought against a headwind. Judging from the fact that Mrs. Markham's aircraft averaged only about 117 miles per hour, the speed of the headwind must have been about 30 miles per hour. (Reuters Dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Budget Estimate Exceeds 800 Million Yen</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army's budget estimate for the next year has recently been largely finalized. It will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance in ten days. The main items of the second defense enhancement plan are (A) mainland relations, (1) improvement of aviation, (2) improvement and enhancement of equipment, improvement of troops, etc. as the center of improving general military equipment, (3) improvement of general combat materials, (B) Manchurian relations (1) enhancement of military equipment in Manchuria, (2) improvement of aviation, equipment improvement, and material improvement based on mainland relations, etc.</p>
<p>The new budget required for implementation next year is roughly around 300 million yen, including the base budget of 336 million yen, the base amount for the Manchurian Incident of 163 million yen, and general new requirements of approximately 20 million yen. Therefore, the total amount of the Army's budget estimate for the next year is approximately 820 million yen. In compiling the budget, the Army authorities proposed absolute amounts as the fundamental principle, with no room for assessment. All expenses have been extremely streamlined, and existing expenses have also been reduced as much as possible. Therefore, it may be difficult to accept reductions to within 800 million yen. (Domei News Agency Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army budget, which is a difficult hurdle in the compilation of next year's budget, was finalized on the 5th, so the budget outline has been largely clarified. Premier Hirota expects that during the deliberation of the huge new Army plan, a dispute will arise with the Army's claim to increase public debt as a source of funds. Therefore, he decided to re-examine the tax increase plan decided by the Ministry of Finance. After the grand maneuvers, a four-minister meeting of the Premier, Finance Minister, Army Minister, and Navy Minister will be held to determine the outline of the defense budget and adjust the military budget with general national policies and revenue plans.

<h3>Japanese Conscription System</h3>
<p>A Special Article from the Hwa Lien News Agency: Japan, with its aspirations to complete hegemony in East Asia, has actively strengthened its military since the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of the feudal system. It established a conscription system based on the principle of "the entire nation is a soldier" to bolster national defense. This system has been revised a total of seventeen times due to the influence of the Russo-Japanese War, the Sino-Japanese War, and the Manchurian Incident. The following is an excerpt of what is stipulated in the current Japanese conscription law, which should be of interest to those who are concerned about Japanese affairs:</p>
<p>(1) All Japanese citizens, except those who have received a sentence of imprisonment with hard labor for more than six years, shall be incorporated into the military registry or be subject to military service. Military service is divided into four types: active service, reserve service, supplementary service, and national service. Active service is further divided into active duty and reserve duty. Supplementary service is divided into first supplementary service and second supplementary service. National service is also divided into first national service and second national service.</p>
<p>(2) The term of service for active duty is seventeen years for the army and twelve years for the navy. Those who have served in the army for two years or in the navy for three years will perform active duty. Reserve duty is served by those who have served five years in the army or four years in the navy. The first supplementary service is twelve years and four months for the army and one year for the navy, and is served by those who are fit for active duty but have not been conscripted. The term of the second supplementary service is twelve years and four months, and is served by those who are fit for active duty but have not been conscripted into active duty or the first supplementary service, as well as those who have completed the first supplementary service in the navy. However, the term for those who have completed the first supplementary service in the navy may be shortened by one year. The first national service is served by those who have completed reserve service and those who have completed supplementary service after receiving military education. The second national service is served by those who have not served in the military and are between the ages of seventeen and forty.</p>
<p>(3) Those who have reached the age of twenty-five and have completed normal school education, and are qualified as elementary school teachers, will only receive five months of active duty training. Those who have not completed military training methods at normal schools will be assigned to national service immediately after completing seven months. In addition, those who have received training at youth training centers or other equivalent training facilities may have their entry time shortened by six months.</p>
<p>(4) Families of active-duty soldiers who cannot survive without relying on the income of the recruit may be exempt from active duty and transferred to non-active duty. Those who have difficulty undergoing rigorous training due to illness or poor physical condition may also be completely exempt from military service.</p>
<p>(5) Men who have reached the age of twenty are of the appropriate age for conscription and must report to the village or town chief in January to await conscription inspection. The number of recruits is based on the number of those in each conscription area and recruitment area who are eligible for inspection. If the quota cannot be met, it will be allocated to other areas for recruitment.</p>
<p>(6) Those with special circumstances, such as being under trial or in confinement, will have their conscription postponed. Postponement of up to two years is also possible due to family living circumstances.</p>
<p>(7) When the number of active-duty soldiers is insufficient, it will be supplemented sequentially by supplementary soldiers.</p>
<p>(8) Retired soldiers, reserve soldiers, supplementary soldiers, and national soldiers may be recalled for duty in times of war or necessity. Reserve soldiers and reserve soldiers may be recalled five times during their service period for practical service drills. Retired soldiers, reserve soldiers, and reserve soldiers will also undergo an annual inspection. However, overseas Chinese and those performing duties abroad are exempt.</p>
<h3>Strike Order in the South Wales Coal Mining Industry Cancelled; Labor and Management Discuss a Solution</h3>
<p>(London) The strike of 200,000 coal miners in South Wales, originally scheduled for Monday, has been averted by reaching a solution at the last minute. This was achieved through the efforts of the Ministry of Mines. The South Wales Miners' Federation has now cancelled the strike notice it issued. The crisis was triggered by the refusal of the Bedwas coal mine owners to accept the Federation's proposal for an independent vote on a disputed issue. The Federation insisted that the miners in the area should vote on whether they wanted to belong to the Federation or remain members of another rival group whose dues were deducted from their wages by the mine owners. Otherwise, the mine owners would meet with Federation leaders to discuss a solution. The Minister of Mines, Mr. Crookshank, has now secured the agreement of the mining companies for both sides to meet on September 9 under a neutral chairman appointed by him, to hear the Federation leaders explain everything and to discuss the issue of a secret ballot. The mine owners claim that their willingness to compromise is solely to avoid the "national disaster" of a South Wales coal mine shutdown. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>Split in the US Labor Movement: Ten Unions Withdraw from the AFL</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Executive Committee of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) previously sent a final notice to ten unions with a million members, ordering them to withdraw within one month from the Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO) led by mining leader John L. Lewis, or their rights would be suspended. The ten unions did not comply with this final notice. Therefore, the split in the American labor movement has become a reality today. AFL President William Green stated that he believes the ten unions have effectively withdrawn from the AFL. However, the AFL Executive Committee still hopes to reach a final understanding with the CIO, resolve differences, and restore labor unity. The AFL will now implement aggressive organizing efforts in all areas and among those employed in various industries. Meanwhile, John L. Lewis indicated that his committee will be a permanent organization and will stand in opposition to the AFL. (Reuters, 5th)</p>

<h3>Difficult to Implement Opening of Refined Salt in Zhejiang</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) Regarding the issue of opening up refined salt raised by various sectors in Zhejiang, Zhou Zonghua, Envoy of Zhejiang Salt Transport, said on the 6th that the reason why refined salt could not be opened up immediately was that it would affect the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of salt farmers and that the monopoly system had not been abolished, making it difficult to open up.

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Guangzhou Bay Have No Protection of Life or Property; Petition for Tax Exemption and Bloody Incident Still Unresolved; Search of Shops and Arrests Occurred Again Last Month</h3>
<p>A Guangzhou Dispatch: Guangzhou Bay, under French jurisdiction, was originally part of southern Guangdong, and its inhabitants are all Cantonese people. Since it was placed under French administration, due to the differences in nationality and conflicts of interest, there has long been discord between the locals and the French. Several months ago, French officials, disregarding the local situation and the hardships of the people, abruptly imposed a poll tax, resulting in a bloody petition by the public. This case has not yet been resolved, and the suffering of the local people has not been alleviated. Unexpectedly, the French officials, believing that the locals were easy to bully, used a minor pretext to arbitrarily search shops in Potou at the end of last month and arrest law-abiding merchants. The Potou Refugee Self-Help Association immediately telegraphed Guangzhou and reported everything to the representatives Chen Bao and Chen Zhili, who had been sent here a few days ago, requesting them to report the tragic case to diplomatic agencies and lodge a protest. The telegram from the Refugee Self-Help Association is as follows: "On the day of the Wanlong Oil Shop in Potou, Wanfu arbitrarily searched, in addition to looting property, and arrested six people, including Mai Meichang and Liang Mingdong. In recent days, they have looted dozens of villages, including Min, Tiantou, Boli, Fenglian, and Huadi, and dozens of other villages, emptying them of their property, slaughtering cattle and livestock, and seizing women. They have also crossed our border and harassed villages such as Le'an. Many refugees have fled to the vicinity of Huangpo in our motherland. We originally planned to implore our government to quickly provide relief, but unexpectedly, the Huangpo Public Security Branch has dispatched personnel and soldiers to drive out the refugees, leaving them with no way to survive. We hope that you will quickly telegraph the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest and request the provincial government to order protection and return south quickly to take charge. Printed by the Self-Help Association." After receiving the telegram, the representatives Chen Zhili and others went to the Office of the Special Diplomatic Commissioner of Guangdong and Guangxi and met with Special Commissioner Diao Zuqian, reporting in detail the recent search and arrest case in Guangzhou Bay and requesting him to protest to the French envoy immediately. Diao replied that this case must be handled according to due process. Once the local officials report the case to the provincial government, which will then forward it to the office, the office will be able to formally negotiate with the authorities in Guangzhou Bay and the French Consulate General in Guangdong. Currently, the representatives can only wait quietly for the official letter from the local government to arrive in Guangdong before urging the diplomatic authorities to appeal for the people.

<h3>Yellow River Situation Not Optimistic; Shaanxi River Rises Sharply Again; Water Level Nearly Equal to That of Last Year's Flood; River Affairs Bureau Director Wang Kairu Departs to Supervise Defense</h3>
<p>A Jinan Dispatch: Since the Yellow River entered the autumn flood season, it experienced a surge a month ago, with turbulent waves shaking the region for a time. Fortunately, it safely flowed into the sea without causing any major disasters along the river. Unexpectedly, the Provincial River Affairs Bureau has repeatedly received reports of flooding in Shangzhou upstream in Shaanxi today (5th). At 4:00 AM this morning (5th), the water level was 295.44 meters, and the flow rate reached 12,100 cubic meters per second. By the afternoon, another water report was received, with the water level increasing to 296.5 meters, a rise of over two meters in one day, nearly equal to the highest water level of last year. The flow rate increased to 17,300 cubic meters per second, only 700 cubic meters per second less than the maximum flow rate last year. It is estimated that this flood crest will reach Shandong Province by the morning of the 7th. The newly appointed Director of the Provincial River Affairs Bureau, Wang Kairu, telegraphed the Chairman of the Provincial Government, Han Fuqu, immediately after receiving the telegram, urging the county magistrates along the river to mobilize laborers and bring tools to strengthen the dikes and prepare for any eventuality. Mr. Wang himself is also scheduled to depart upstream at dawn on the 6th, carrying a large sum of money to supervise the defense. As for the water conditions and construction situation of the Yellow River in Shandong Province, there have been no changes today (5th). All the areas that were scoured and collapsed last time have been repaired and stabilized, and it is possible that they will safely weather the flood, as they did last time. It is estimated that after this flood reaches Shandong, the water level at Luokou will increase to between 31 and 32 meters, creating the highest record for the Yellow River this year. The following is a record of the official correspondence related to river works today (5th):</p>
<p>(1) Telegram to the Provincial Government: Respectfully to the Shandong Provincial Government, I have just received a water report from Shaanxi, stating that at 4:00 AM on September 5, the water level was 295.44 meters, and the flow rate was 12,100 cubic meters per second. It is estimated that this water will reach Shandong in about two days. In addition to notifying all county magistrates, general section chiefs, flood control officers, and directors of dam construction bureaus along the river to supervise and strictly guard against it, I respectfully submit this to the Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government and Director of the River Affairs Bureau, Han Fuqu. Respectfully stamped by Han, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government. Respectfully to Han, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, I have repeatedly received water reports from Shaanxi, stating that the river water has risen sharply today, and by 12:00 PM, it had risen about 2.5 meters, with a flow rate of 17,300 cubic meters per second. It is estimated that it will reach Shandong as early as tomorrow. In addition to notifying all county magistrates, general section chiefs, flood control officers, and directors of dam construction bureaus along the river to supervise and strictly guard against it, without any negligence, I respectfully submit this to the Director of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau, Wang Kairu.</p>
<p>(2) Telegram from Director Wang to Chairman Kong: Respectfully to Kong, Chairman of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission and Director of the Flood Control Office in Kaifeng, I have learned that the water level of the Yellow River in Shandong has risen sharply since entering the autumn flood season. Chairman Han is burdened with complex political affairs and finds it difficult to manage everything, so he has specially appointed Kairu to manage river affairs. On the day I took office, the water level in Shaanxi happened to rise, nearly equal to the water level of last year. In addition to sending a telegram to the Shandong Provincial Government to notify the county magistrates along the river to mobilize labor and cooperate in defense, Kairu bears a heavy responsibility and dares not delay. I plan to go to the upper reaches on the 6th of this month with Pan Yifen, Chief of the Engineering Section, and other bureau staff, carrying a large sum of money, to supervise the county sections and strictly guard against any danger, in order to ensure safety. I respectfully report this out of duty. Respectfully stamped by Wang Kairu, Director of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>(3) Telegram from Han to the county magistrates along the river: To the county magistrates along the river, general section chiefs, flood control officers, and directors of dam construction bureaus, I have just received a water report from Shaanxi, stating that at 4:00 AM on September 5, the water level was 295.44 meters, and the flow rate was 12,100 cubic meters per second. It is estimated that this water will reach Shandong in about two days. I urge you to follow the notification, supervise and strictly guard against it, without any negligence. Chairman and Director Han Fuqu.</p>
<p>(4) Telegram from Director Wang to the county magistrates along the river: To the county magistrates along the river, general section chiefs of the upper and lower reaches, sectional chiefs, flood control officers, and directors of dam construction bureaus, I have repeatedly received water reports from Shaanxi, stating that the river water has risen sharply today, and by 12:00 PM, it had risen about 2 meters, with the water level reaching 296 meters. According to the flow rate calculation, it is estimated that it will reach Shandong early tomorrow. The magnitude of this water flow is not much different from the maximum water level of last year. I urgently telegram you to supervise and strictly guard against it, day and night, without any懈怠. Respectfully stamped by Director Wang Kairu.</p>
<h3>The Execution of the Puppet Bandit Wang Daoyi in Shangdu; Like the Old Play "Chopping the Yellow Robe"; Fully Demonstrating the Ignorance of the Bandits; The Japanese Machinations Are Extremely Vicious</h3>
<p>A Zhangjiakou Dispatch: Wang Daoyi, a puppet bandit from northern Chahar, played a leading role in the previous invasion of Suiyuan. However, the invasion failed, leading to his entrapment by the Japanese. Since the news of his death spread, there have been three versions of the story: (1) When the bandit Wang invaded Suiyuan, two Japanese instructors accompanied him. The eastern part of Suiyuan suffered heavy blows from our Jin-Sui Army, resulting in many casualties, and the instructors were also killed in the chaos. This led the Japanese to transfer their hatred to Wang and initiate the plot to kill him. (2) When the bandit Wang departed from Zhangbei to invade eastern Suiyuan, he led a force of over a thousand men. In order to encourage banditry, the Japanese issued military pay of 10,000 yuan, ordering the bandit Wang to distribute it to the bandits. However, the bandit Wang pocketed the money, issuing only 40 cents to each soldier, totaling no more than 300-400 yuan. The Japanese, angered by his embezzlement of military pay and the failure of the invasion, plotted to kill him. (3) The bandit Wang's subordinates were ambitious before invading Suiyuan, hoping to gain high positions and wealth in Suiyuan. Unexpectedly, the invasion became a bubble, and the remaining troops numbered only a hundred or so. Discontented with the bandit Wang's inability to command, the subordinates killed him. Regardless of the above reasons, whether he was entrapped by someone or killed by his subordinates, the stories are varied and inconclusive. According to someone from Shangdu, the entrapment of Wang Daoyi was quite comical, similar to the "Chopping the Yellow Robe" scene in old plays. Even with the bullet about to hit his head, he still didn't know that death was near. The following is a detailed account of his death: The military and political affairs of the puppet government in northern Chahar are controlled by Tanaka, the head of the special affairs organ, a Japanese. After Wang Daoyi's failure to disrupt Suiyuan, he went to Jiabu Temple to meet with Tanaka. Tanaka, believing that the bandit Wang's combat was unfavorable and that his bandit army's organization was complex and could not be successful, decided to eliminate him. However, when he met Wang, he still used appeasement tactics, comforting him and giving him 100 yuan to return to Shangdu for reorganization. He also sent his deputy, Mingyue, a Japanese, to assist in reorganizing the bandit army in Shangdu. After arriving in Shangdu, Wang Daoyi treated Mingyue with great hospitality, regarding him as an imperial envoy, serving him with wine and food. After the entertainment, Wang Daoyi returned to his headquarters and sent two staff officers to entertain Mingyue exclusively. While staying in Shangdu, Mingyue was invited to a Chinese meal. During the banquet, Mingyue pretended to be drunk and summoned Zhao Kuige, the brigade commander under the bandit Wang, to drink with him. Mingyue, feigning drunkenness, used the Zhao Kuangyin face from the old play "Chopping the Yellow Robe," ordering Wang Daoyi to come and talk. When the bandit Wang arrived at the brigade, he brought four guards, all armed and well-equipped, creating a Hongmen Banquet atmosphere. Seeing the strength of the guards, Mingyue sent them away to another room and drank heartily with Wang and Zhao. Mingyue continued to pretend to be drunk and ordered Wang Daoyi to sit in another room temporarily. He said to Zhao Kuige, "Do you want to be promoted?" Zhao replied, "I am willing to obey the sir." He asked again, "Do you have courage?" Zhao answered, "Yes." He asked again, "Do you dare to tie up Wang Daoyi?" Zhao replied, "Dare." He then ordered, "Tie him up quickly!" At this time, Zhao Kuige was blinded by greed, while Wang Daoyi thought that Mingyue was truly drunk and was just joking, so he laughed and said to Zhao, "This man is really drunk. Why tie me up?" He was tied up without suspicion. After Wang was tied up, Mingyue asked Zhao again, "Do you have courage?" Zhao replied, "Yes." He asked again, "Can you quickly disarm Wang's four guards?" Zhao obeyed. After the matter was settled, Mingyue and Zhao continued to chat and drink heartily, and served meat dishes. Mingyue, seeing that it was already 11:00 PM and that the food and drink were sufficient, drew out his handgun and said solemnly to Zhao, "Do you want to be promoted?" Zhao said, "Yes." Mingyue said, "Good, I give you an order, and you are not allowed to disobey. If you hesitate, I will kill you on the spot, and you are not allowed to leak the news." He asked again, "Do you have courage?" He replied, "Yes." He then ordered Zhao to kill Wang Daoyi quickly. Zhao obeyed. Ming and Zhao then went to Wang Daoyi's room, laughing and pointing to Zhao, saying, "You can send Commander Wang back." At this time, the bandit Wang still thought that Mingyue was doing him a favor by sending him back to headquarters, and he still did not know that death was near. He thanked Mingyue repeatedly. But when he reached the east gate, he suddenly woke up and said, "Alas, my life is over." At the moment before the execution, Zhao Kuige, realizing that he had followed Wang Daoyi for many years, experienced a pang of conscience and shed tears. If Zhao and Wang had fled together at this time, it would have been possible to save the situation. But heaven is just, and Wang had been a bandit for many years, his crimes unforgivable. Just then, Zhao's follower, holding a gun, said to Zhao, "What sympathy do you still have for the commander (referring to Wang)? He deducted a lot of our military pay in Yongning, giving us only 40 cents each. He can be the commander, but we can't? Are we not allowed to be commanders?" He immediately raised his gun, and Zhao Kuige shot Wang Daoyi. It was already midnight at this time. Zhao reported to Mingyue, who still pretended to be drunk and laughed loudly, ending the matter. Thus, Wang Daoyi, who commanded tens of thousands of soldiers, had disturbed several provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Chahar, and Suiyuan, had repeatedly resisted government troops, and had dominated for a time, had his life ended by someone using a little trick. I wonder if the general bandits who followed him have realized something or not. (3rd)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Villagers of Tinglin Township Robbed</h3>
<p>In Tinglin Jiufeng Township, under the jurisdiction of the county, in the first jia of the fourth bao, at the home of villager Yan Dishun, around 11 PM the day before yesterday, seven or eight robbers speaking a local dialect suddenly arrived.

<h3>Major Fire Erupts in Broad Daylight</h3>
<p>At the home of Huang Rongmei, a resident of Guojiaqiao, near Xuedianzhen in the eighth district, a fire suddenly broke out around 4 PM yesterday.

<h3>Changshu: Two Red Pill Operations Cracked</h3>
<p>The local Public Security Bureau cracked down on two red pill trafficking operations in Xushi and Yangjian the night before last, seizing more than eight thousand red pills and other drugs, and arresting six suspects. The Public Security Bureau received a tip-off that someone was secretly operating a red pill operation in the Xushi area. Upon receiving the report, the bureau first purchased a restricted wire, bringing twenty-five silver dollars to place an order, with the delivery scheduled for the fifth night. The bureau then dispatched officer Feng Yimao, disguised as a farmer, leading police in a boat to ambush near Suntang in Xushi. At the appointed time, someone from the operation did indeed bring a suitcase to the delivery location. The police converged and apprehended the suspect, searching their operation and seizing more than two thousand red pills. The main suspects were Pang Xiaoliu, Xia Sheng, Xia Xushi, and Xia Zhushi. Pang confessed that Xushi was a branch operation and that the main operation was located in Yangjian Township.

Before he could avoid them, they threatened him with guns and seized him. The bandits searched the house and, finding no valuable clothing or jewelry, took Xingquan out. His cousin, Huang Ahang, also a farmer, lived next door to Xingquan. He was also invaded by bandits and kidnapped at the same time as Xingquan, and taken towards Taiping Bridge.

<h3>Hangzhou: Four Banks Extend Loan for Commercial Exhibition</h3>
<p>In the past, Zhejiang Province borrowed 1.8 million yuan from the China Farmers Bank to build roads, using 3 million yuan in government bonds as collateral. It also borrowed 1.2 million yuan from the Salt Industry, Zhongnan, Jincheng, and Dalu banks, using the income from several roads in eastern Zhejiang as collateral. Of the above two loans, about 700,000 yuan has been repaid, with the remainder outstanding. Due to the province's frozen expenditures, it has been approved by the Farmers Bank to extend the loan for six years and exchange it for new government bonds as collateral. As for the four banks, they intend to recover the roads and use 1.5 million yuan in consolidated government bonds as collateral, guaranteeing only 10,000 yuan in road income, and extending the repayment period for four years and six months. Cheng Yuanfan, the director of the Department of Finance, went to Shanghai yesterday to negotiate with the authorities of the four banks in order to re-sign the contract.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Branch Line to Begin Survey</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau received an order from the Ministry to plan the construction of the Yushu to Ganzhou branch line.

The budget has been submitted to the board of directors for forwarding to the Ministry of Railways for allocation in order to start the survey. In addition, the construction of the Nanping section has been greatly affected due to the rampant banditry along the line. Because materials could not be transported in time, they have been diverted through Hangzhou and Jiujiang to Nanchang to Zhangshu segment this month can begin laying track and so on.</p>

<h3>Finance Minister Kong Speaks Freely on the Central Financial Situation; Income Tax Set to Begin on October 1st; Central Government Pledges Solace to Guangdong People by Issuing Financial Bonds; Implementing Gambling Ban and Cutting Back on Excessive and Miscellaneous Taxes to Alleviate People's Hardships in Guangdong</h3>
<p>According to the New News Agency, Kong Xiangxi, the Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, received a reporter from the New News Agency at the Central Bank yesterday. He spoke about the central financial situation, the reorganization of Guangdong's finances, and the establishment of a Guangzhou branch of the Central Bank. He also expressed his encouragement to the people of the nation in light of this year's abundant agricultural harvest, urging them not only to rejoice but also to pay attention to how to increase production further to achieve economic self-sufficiency and the goal of a prosperous people and a strong nation. The details of his discussion are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Income Tax to Be Levied</p>
<p>Last year, central finances suffered a significant shortfall in customs duties due to rampant smuggling. Expenditures increased by more than 100 million yuan, with a shortfall of over 200 million yuan. This was the imbalance between financial revenue and expenditure. Fortunately, by adhering to the principle of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, efforts were made to maintain the situation and reorganize tax collection, save various expenses, and overcome the difficulties. This year, it is hoped that the unification of Guangdong and Guangxi will be completed, and the nation's credit will be further consolidated. Smuggling will gradually be curbed with the efforts of the customs and the assistance of the people, resulting in fewer tax revenue losses. In accordance with international precedents and without hindering the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce, preparations are being made to levy income tax, starting on October 1st with the income from salaries and wages of civil servants and the income from public bonds and deposit interest. This type of direct tax revenue benefits the nation and does not harm the people. If it can be managed properly, it will become the center of various tax revenues. Therefore, after some time, financial revenue and expenditure can be balanced due to the effectiveness of the new tax. The obligation of the people to pay taxes to the nation can also be equalized. Income tax is levied on those who benefit, which is completely different from the former likin and miscellaneous taxes. This demonstrates the government's concern for the people's livelihood and its reluctance to increase taxes and burden the people. This has already been recognized by the people.</p>
<p>Reorganizing Guangdong's Finances</p>
<p>Since Vice Minister Zou and Director Zhu went to Guangdong, they have been following the central government's established policies, with the primary emphasis on reforming the currency system to unify it with the national currency system. In the past, the Guangdong authorities did not comply with the central government's laws and regulations and issued excessive amounts of "hao quan" (small denomination currency) for their own benefit. The total amount issued reached more than 249 million yuan, with cash reserves of only about 43%. Provincial treasury bills worth 92 million yuan were used as protection reserves, but the foundation was not solid. Therefore, in order to stabilize the market and show sympathy for the people of Guangdong, the central government decided to issue 120 million yuan in Guangdong financial bonds to make up for the 17% shortfall in cash reserves and the 40% guarantee reserves to comply with the law. In terms of local finances, gambling will be banned, and excessive and miscellaneous taxes will be reduced to alleviate the people's hardships. On the expenditure side, the focus will be on reducing spending, and all non-essential needs will be restricted. The Guangdong Department of Finance is currently being instructed to revise the provincial budget for the 25th year and submit it to the ministry for approval and implementation. Regarding the establishment of a Guangzhou branch of the Central Bank, Li Tisheng, Deputy Director of the Treasury Department, and Zhou Shouliang, Deputy Director of the Business Department, were sent to investigate the actual situation. They have returned to Shanghai and reported. Manager Zhong of the Hankou branch of the Central Bank has been appointed and will go to Guangdong to prepare for the establishment of the branch. As for whether it is necessary to establish a separate branch in Guangxi, this will be determined based on actual needs after the establishment of the Guangdong branch.</p>
<p>Abundant Harvests in Various Regions</p>
<p>Subsequently, Mr. Kong expressed his satisfaction with the abundant agricultural harvests in various regions this year. However, he paid particular attention to how to avoid low grain prices harming farmers. According to him, this year's abundant harvest was due to both divine assistance and human effort. In recent years, the construction of water conservancy projects, the expansion of cultivated areas, and the improvement of planting techniques in various provinces have all been sources of increased production. Therefore, he hopes that the people of the nation will not only rejoice in this year of abundance but also pay attention to how to work harder to increase production. According to our statistics, there are no less than 4 billion mu of arable land in our country, but only 1.5 billion mu are currently used for cultivation. He hopes that the people will not only improve the land that has already been cultivated, increase production as much as possible, but also actively expand the cultivation of wasteland. It is essential to ensure that the nation's food supply is self-sufficient. Even more important is the accumulation of grain and the adjustment of surpluses and deficiencies. The Changping granary system should be implemented to store grain for disaster prevention and to adjust the food supply according to needs. This will prevent grain prices from falling due to abundant harvests and harming farmers. The internal department is currently planning this, and it is expected to be implemented soon.</p>
<p>National Financial Stability</p>
<p>Since the impact of the global economic panic, the national finances have been in a precarious state for the past two years. Due to the bankruptcy of rural areas, the stagnation of industry and commerce, and the tightening of finances in the interior, funds have been concentrated in urban areas, making the nation's financial situation akin to the human body's blood not being able to circulate. The government's resolute reform of the currency system last year and the implementation of the legal tender policy, on the one hand, ordered the three major banks of the Central, China, and Communications to provide large amounts of low-interest loans to facilitate acceptance bills and discounting to adjust the economy of industry and commerce. On the other hand, it balanced foreign exchange, restricted the outflow of funds, stabilized the bond market, eliminated speculation, and urged banks to invest in rural areas to adjust the rural economy. In recent months, the implementation of legal tender has been due to sufficient cash reserves and increasingly solid credit. Therefore, in recent years, the frequent exchange between Shanghai and various regions, the balance of call rates, etc., are all enough to show the stability of the financial situation. This is truly gratifying.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce and Others Nominate Candidates Yesterday; Candidate Nomination by Local Occupational Groups Completed; Results of Nomination Awaiting Ballot Counting at a Later Date; Regional Elections Currently Being Actively Prepared</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce and other three units nominated candidates separately. At the Chamber of Commerce, the office sent Hu Yuqi and Huang Tiren as polling supervisors, and Lin Guifu, Zhu Yangwu, Zhou Zhongzhao, Hu Tianseng, and others as polling officers. At the Reporters Association, the office sent Zhang Xiaotong as the polling supervisor, and Cao Peizi and Huang Xianggu as the polling officers. At the City Education Association, the office sent Cao Peizi as the polling supervisor, and Zhang Lichun, Yuan Zengyu, and Ma Rensong as the polling officers. All voted in accordance with the law. The nomination process went well. All ballot boxes were sealed by the officers in public and taken back to the office, awaiting ballot counting at a later date to reveal the results of the nomination. It was found that there were a total of eight units of occupational groups and free occupational groups in the city: agriculture (fishery), industry, commerce, lawyers, accountants, physicians, journalists, and education. With the completion of the nomination by the Chamber of Commerce, Reporters Association, and Education Association yesterday, all procedures for nominating candidates by occupational groups in this city have been completely completed. The regional election in this city involves a larger scope and requires more effort. In addition, this city does not have a division of townships, towns, and neighborhoods, so it will be necessary to wait for the completion of the citizen's oath of citizenship before it is easy to start. However, time is short, and the office will temporarily divide the nomination areas. The method has been drafted and will be submitted to the mayor for approval before it can be started.</p>

<h3>National Goods Maintenance Association Cables the Executive Yuan and Ministries to Stop New Taxes in Hebei and Chahar</h3>
<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association telegraphed the Executive Yuan and ministries yesterday, saying, "To President Jiang of the Executive Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, and Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry: Having read the report on September 3rd that the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission is establishing a new inspection office in Tianjin for smuggled goods, collecting a light tax of one-eighth of the current customs duty, which will allow them to circulate within the Hebei-Chahar territory, the merchants of our national goods industry are shocked. Customs duties are meant to be fair. If taxes in South China are eight times higher than in North China, our official goods will be defeated by smuggled goods. Our government's strict anti-smuggling efforts have achieved considerable results. They are trying to achieve their desires through all sorts of schemes because they cannot sell their goods. If they are deceived by them, the anti-smuggling work will be eliminated, and the national economy and people's livelihood will be exhausted. For the sake of respecting the laws and protecting the people's livelihood, the association is sending a special telegram. We earnestly request that you immediately order a stop to this and strictly order the commission to collect taxes in accordance with the current customs duties and not to make any concessions. We await your urgent orders. The China National Goods Maintenance Association."</p>
<h3>Zhang Jia'ao Flew to Shanghai Yesterday; Departs for Guangzhou First Thing This Morning</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, Minister of Railways Zhang Jia'ao returned to Beijing on the evening of the 4th after passing through Hangzhou from Moganshan (it is a mistake to say that Zhang came to Shanghai from Beijing on the evening of the 4th) to handle ministerial affairs. Now, in order to inspect the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, he flew to Shanghai again at 11:30 AM yesterday with Minister Pan of the Ministry of Railways. After disembarking, he returned to his private residence on Julida Road to rest.

According to Minister Pan, who spoke to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, Minister Zhang has decided that the Guangdong-Hankou Railway will be fully opened on October 10th and needs to be inspected. Therefore, he has decided to go to Guangzhou. The planned itinerary is to depart from Shanghai, go to Nanchang via Hangzhou, first inspect the condition of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, then go to Changsha from Nanchang, and then inspect the Guangdong-Hankou Railway along the way to Guangzhou. The trip will take less than a week and then he must return to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Association Cables Request to Refute Tianjin's Exemption from Tax on Accumulated Rayon</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Association has recently learned that representatives of the dyeing and weaving industry in Tianjin have requested the Ministry of Finance to exempt all the accumulated rayon textiles from taxes and allow them to be transported and sold. If this is realized, the livelihoods of millions of silk industry and commerce people in Jiangsu and Zhejiang will be plunged into a desperate situation. Therefore, they are specially cabling the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry to strongly argue for an immediate rejection. The original text reads: "To President Jiang of the Executive Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, and Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry: We have read the article in the Shen Bao on the 3rd of this month about the representatives of the Tianjin dyeing and weaving industry arriving in Beijing to petition, the contents of which request three points: (1) More than 240,000 bolts of accumulated rayon textiles have been registered in accordance with the order. Please order the customs to issue transport licenses. (2) Rayon already woven but not completed in the machines should be exempted from taxes. (3) Rayon in storage, except for those with customs documents, will be taxed in accordance with the ministry's orders. It is known that smuggling is rampant in North China and then spreads to other provinces. Our government, seeing that this will harm the people and destroy the country, has resolutely issued a clear order to strictly suppress smuggling. Since the implementation, although the transportation of silk by passengers and goods in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has been hindered and the measures have not yet been perfected, this smuggled goods has been eradicated in South China and the results have been significant. Not only are our Jiangsu and Zhejiang national goods industry and commerce benefited, but also European and American firms are equally impressed. The finished and unfinished rayon textiles stored in Tianjin were obviously woven from smuggled raw materials. If you are deceived by them and rashly allow them to be exempt from taxes and sold throughout the country, the price of smuggled goods in the north will be cheap and the price of official goods in the south will be expensive. Not only will the livelihoods of millions of cord industry and commerce people in Jiangsu and Zhejiang be plunged into a desperate situation, but the anti-smuggling work that our government has been painstakingly managing for several months will also be in vain. Our official tax goods have high capital costs and will be defeated by smuggled goods. Weighing the two evils, this one is more important than the other. Please, we hope that the leaders will not be fooled, resolutely reject it, and order them to pay all taxes in accordance with the same tax rate as their counterparts in South China, regardless of whether it is finished or unfinished fabrics, before they can be allowed to be transported and sold, so as to strengthen the laws and protect the people's livelihood. We anxiously send a telegram, requesting instructions to reassure industry and commerce and protect official goods, which is in the public interest. Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Association." At the same time, the association sent telegrams to the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, asking them to work with the local chambers of commerce to assist and strive to achieve the goal.</p>

<h3>Jiangzhe Autumn Cocoons Soon to Enter the Market; Silk Factories Prepare to Borrow Funds for Purchases; Zhejiang Cocoon Control Association Announces Registration for Purchasing Autumn Cocoons; Various Banks and Businesses Resolve to Offer as Many Loans as Possible for Cocoon Purchases</h3>
<p>This year's autumn silkworm seeds in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, after being distributed to farmers by the silk authorities of the two provinces for hatching, will soon enter the market in mid-month. The Zhejiang Silk Association has announced registration for cocoon purchases, and silk merchants are contacting banks and money houses to secure loans to purchase cocoons in preparation for the harvest. The details are reported as follows:</p>
<p>Zhejiang Cocoon Control Association Handles Registration</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government will continue to implement control measures for autumn cocoon purchases, similar to the spring season. In addition to the Zhejiang Provincial Government's Provisional Measures for the Control and Management of Autumn Cocoon Purchases for the 25th Year of the Republic, and the regulations of the Cocoon Purchase Office, which were passed by the Provincial Government meeting on the 4th, the Zhejiang Provincial Silk Control Committee has specifically announced a call for merchants to register for the purchase of autumn cocoons within the province. The announcement states: "The improved silkworm seeds distributed by this Association for the 25th year's autumn season are about to yield cocoons. All silk cocoon merchants from within and outside the province who wish to purchase these fresh cocoons should come to the Association to apply for registration from now until 5:00 PM on September 10th. Do not delay. This is hereby announced." The Association's address is 30 Changsheng Road, Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Silk Cocoon Merchants Seek Cocoon Purchase Loans</p>
<p>Silk factories, members of the silk factory associations in Zhejiang, Shanghai, Wuxi, and other places, held a joint meeting in Hangzhou at the end of last month to discuss measures for purchasing autumn cocoons, requesting the Zhejiang Provincial Silk Control Association to (1) fairly set prices for autumn cocoons and broadly define grades, and (2) crack down on the practice of using fake cooperatives to purchase cocoons for profit. Representatives were separately dispatched to contact the Cocoon Control Association. It is now learned that various silk factories have already begun preparing to purchase autumn cocoons, registering with the Zhejiang Cocoon Control Association for purchases on one hand, and contacting banks and money houses with whom they have established relationships on the other, to discuss cocoon purchase quantities and loan amounts, following past practices for cocoon purchase loans. Some of these loans have already been secured, with amounts generally around tens of thousands of yuan. The remaining loans are still under negotiation, and it is expected that agreements can be reached before the autumn cocoons enter the market, allowing for purchases to be made at the production sites.</p>
<p>Banks and Businesses Offer Autumn Cocoon Loans</p>
<p>The Jiangzhe Spring Season Loan Syndicate, organized by various banks and money houses such as the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, and Fuyuan Bank, achieved good results in providing cocoon purchase loans. Now, various banks and businesses, considering that the autumn cocoon yield has historically been less than the spring cocoon yield, have decided not to organize an autumn cocoon syndicate to handle cocoon purchase loans. Instead, they will continue to follow past practices, with each bank and business offering as many autumn cocoon loans as possible within its capabilities. Therefore, Jiangzhe silk factories and surplus cocoon merchants who wish to purchase autumn cocoons can directly contact various banks and money houses to apply for loans. The loan procedures will be the same as those used by the Jiangzhe Cocoon Purchase Loan Syndicate during the spring season. Guangdong Qinyin University Architectural Survey Team</p>
<h3>Arrived in Shanghai by Ship Yesterday; Scheduled to Go to Beijing Today or Tomorrow, Then to Tianjin and Beiping</h3>
<p>Sixteen students from the Department of Architecture, Faculty of Engineering, of Guangdong Provincial Qinyin University, led by Professors Mai Yunyu and Le Wenhan, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning on the Taikoo Shipping Company's "Sichuan" ship for a northern inspection tour. It is reported that the group is scheduled to go to Beijing today or tomorrow to inspect architectural projects, and is expected to stay for four or five days, after which they will go to Tianjin, Beiping, and other places to inspect ancient Chinese architecture. They will then return to Shanghai, with the entire trip expected to last one month.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West People's Education Experimental Zone Conducts Insect Catching Demonstration Yesterday; Distinguishing Beneficial Insects from Pests; Instilling Scientific Knowledge</h3>
<p>According to the Rural Society, the Shanghai West People's Education Experimental Zone, in order to instill scientific knowledge of insect catching among farmers and to demonstrate scientific methods of insect catching, held its first insect catching demonstration yesterday. The reporter, recognizing that this activity would greatly benefit farmers, drove to the zone early in the morning to participate. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Grand Departure</p>
<p>Starting at 8:00 AM yesterday, all staff members of the zone gathered at the Nian Er Society on Zhongshan Road. Zone Director Tang Maohuai, Agricultural Department Director Ling Zhiying, Lou Jiaji, Counselor of the Nian Er Society in Xujiazhai, Xu Shuquan, Counselor of the Nian Er Society in Shanghai West, Secretary Zhou Congyi, and more than 40 children from the planting and textile cooperatives gathered. They loaded more than 10 kinds of tools, including teaching materials, natural planting charts, self-made insect catching diagrams, and self-made specimens of beneficial and harmful insects, into the educational vehicle invented by Mr. Bu Shuangqiu. At 9:00 AM, they braved the heat and set off, creating a grand scene.</p>
<p>Notes en Route</p>
<p>They first set off from the front of Datong University. The children from the cooperative teams led the way, pulling the simple and convenient educational vehicle. Although they encountered difficulties with the low-lying areas, stone bridges, and narrow paths, with the vigorous efforts of Tang, Ling, Lou, and Xu, they safely passed through more than ten villages, including Meiyuan, Xujiazhai, and Qiujiang. The four directors were drenched in sweat, creating a heroic sight. They returned to the society to rest as the sun set.</p>
<p>Insect Catching Activity</p>
<p>Each time they arrived at a place, the instructors turned the educational vehicle into a classroom. Mr. Ling used a megaphone to gather the farmers. Soon, male and female farmers of all ages gathered, eager to see what was happening. Ling Zhiying, Director of the Rural Department, then began teaching, explaining the following: (1) How to prevent and eliminate pests: (A) Prevention methods, (B) Manual methods; (2) Natural elimination methods; (3) Chemical elimination methods; (4) Why there are so many pests in gardens; (5) The reinforcements that kill our enemies: (A) Woodpeckers, which prey on pests in trees, (B) Swallows and dragonflies, which prey on flying pests, (C) Mantises and frogs, which prey on pests in the fields. Finally, in addition to instructions on insect catching, temporary medical consultations were provided, and the promotion of local products was also carried out.</p>
<p>Purpose of the Demonstration</p>
<p>According to Zone Director Tang Maohuai, since Mr. Tai Shuangqiu and the directors of various departments have been working hard to promote the area, significant progress has been made. Numerous activities with people's education as the goal have been carried out. In general, the people of this zone are willing to actively participate in various activities. Recently, in view of the severe proliferation of insects that hinder the growth of rice, vegetables, and other crops, a new insect catching demonstration activity was specifically organized to prevent harm to crops. The purpose is fourfold: (1) To instill scientific knowledge of insect catching, (2) To demonstrate scientific methods of insect catching, (3) To promote the organization of people's cooperation, (4) To implement rural hygiene instructions.</p>
<p>Examples of Slogans</p>
<p>(1) Leafhoppers, borers, and locusts are the enemies of our rice crops; (2) Swallows are reinforcements that help us catch pests; (3) Frogs help us catch pests; (4) Aphids suck the nutrients from plants; (5) Grasshoppers harm various crops; (6) Mantises help us catch pests; (7) Woodpeckers help us catch pests in trees; (8) We should protect swallows and kill borers and locusts; (9) We should protect frogs and eliminate grasshoppers; (10) We should change our attitude of disliking mantises and protect mantises; (11) We pledge not to eat frogs; (12) Eliminate aphids, leafhoppers, borers, locusts, and all pests.</p>

<h3>County Agricultural Warehouse to Open on a Fixed Date; Sends Greetings to Farmers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Agricultural Warehouse Management Committee has selected a location in Zhuanqiao on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road to establish an agricultural warehouse, which will be managed by the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank. He Yongjiang has been appointed as the director, and the opening ceremony is scheduled for the 11th of this month. Invitations have been sent to various agencies, organizations, and Baojia personnel to attend in Zhuanqiao. A banquet will be held tomorrow (the 8th) to report the warehouse's business methods to local residents. In the future, the warehouse will accept mortgages on cotton, rice, beans, wheat, rapeseed, and various agricultural products. Office hours will be from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, and the warehouse will also be open on Sundays. It is learned that the bank has issued the following declaration: The Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank respectfully informs the farmers of Zhuanqiao: As everyone knows, the rural economy has declined to an extreme point. Slogans for rural relief can be heard everywhere, but empty talk cannot help the reality. The Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank has come to Zhuanqiao to establish an agricultural warehouse, which is truly putting rural relief into practice. Now, let's talk about the benefits of the agricultural warehouse for everyone. The agricultural warehouse is an organization that regulates rural finance and increases the prices of agricultural products. Therefore, the warehouse is not solely for profit, but entirely for serving rural areas and facilitating farmers. It is absolutely not here to make a big profit from you. During the harvest season, the prices of agricultural products are bound to fall. Most farmers are poor and have already allocated their harvests for various uses before they are even reaped. They cannot wait for prices to rise and have already sold their harvests at low prices, even selling the grain they need for their own consumption at low prices. When they need it themselves, they have to buy rice at high prices to use. This is so heartbreaking. With a warehouse, if you need money but don't want to sell your agricultural products because the price is too low, or if you need grain for your own consumption but cannot sell your products, you can mortgage your agricultural products to the agricultural warehouse. The interest rate on mortgages is particularly low. If you need the loan for less than a month, it can be calculated daily. You can also mortgage in bulk and redeem in small amounts. In addition to the Farmers Bank's eight-li loan rate, the warehouse charges a handling fee and insurance fee, but the total cost is only slightly more than one point. For example, if you mortgage a bale of cotton to the warehouse for about six yuan, the cost for one month would only be about seven fen. If the price of each bale increases by one yuan, and you have ten bales of cotton, you can earn about eight yuan in profit after mortgaging them for three months. The agricultural warehouse is a service-oriented organization, so its treatment of farmers is very kind. Even if you only have three or five bales, they will be accepted. If you don't understand the mortgage procedures, the staff will explain them to you in detail. Since the warehouse is thinking of convenience for farmers in every way, you must also maintain your credit. The agricultural products you mortgage must not contain moldy or rotten items, other impurities, or the bad habit of adding water. If such practices are discovered, they will affect the interests of most mortgagors, so we hope that farmers will pay special attention to this. If farmers have agricultural products that they do not want to sell or mortgage for the time being, and have no place to store them, the warehouse can store them on your behalf. The storage fee is very small, and there is fire insurance for extra safety. Therefore, (1) if you want to sell your agricultural products at a good price, please come to our warehouse to mortgage them; (2) the warehouse is the farmers' own storage facility; (3) the warehouse is the farmers' financial institution.</p>

<h3>National Military and Political Circles Held Public Memorial Service for Sun Bolan Yesterday; More Than 2,000 People Attended, Including Wu Tiecheng; Zhu Qinglan Was Publicly Elected as the Presiding Official</h3>
<p>Premier Chiang of the Executive Yuan (represented by Qi Junqing) and more than 2,000 people from the national military and political circles, including Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Zhiben, Pan Gongzhan, Jiang Tianduo, Xu Langxi, Song Zheyuan (represented by Qi Junqing), Chen Diaoyuan, Xue Dubi, and Li Zhonggong, held a public memorial service for revolutionary pioneer Mr. Sun Bolan yesterday at the Sun residence on Route Masnan. Several bamboo sheds were erected in front of the Sun residence. A square "dian" (奠) character was placed in the center of the doorway, with white flags fluttering on both sides, bearing the Sun character. Upon entering, one immediately saw a dense display of elegiac scrolls and couplets from famous figures. A plaque with the words "His Voice and Appearance Still Seem Present" was placed high above the spirit hall entrance. A portrait of Mr. Sun was hung in the center, and eulogies, wreaths, and streamers from various circles were hung around the venue, creating a scene of white, which evoked a sense of mourning. From morning onwards, the scene with white vehicles and horses was particularly mournful.</p>

<h3>Gentry and Merchants in Pudong Initiate Organization of a Large Drug Rehabilitation Center; Establish a Drug Rehabilitation Branch in Nicheng; Decide to Raise Funds of 50,000 Yuan Separately</h3>

<h3>Continuous Autumn Heat</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn in this city, the scorching sun has been raging, no less than in midsummer. On the 2nd of this month, the temperature suddenly rose to 90 degrees. On the 3rd, due to the passage of a hurricane, it dropped slightly to 88 degrees. On the 4th, it rose again. One cannot part with the autumn fan, and even sleeping at night, one still cannot remove the mat. However, as the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, it is easy to get sick if one seeks coolness. It is hoped that citizens will pay attention to their diet and daily life.</p>

<h3>Famous Explorer Yang Dize to Regularly Go to Burma to Seek Golden Monkeys</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports: The famous explorer Yang Dize is scheduled to embark on the steamer "Jiahou" this Tuesday (the 8th) to the Irrawaddy River in Burma to seek the golden monkey, a local specialty. This trip plans to first go to Kolkata, then to Garhwal on the border of Nepal, to join the American Youth Expedition Team. This team is currently attempting to climb Langda Taiwan Peak in the British Himalayas. After making necessary arrangements in Garhwal, the entire team will venture deep into the interior of Burma, passing through the territory inhabited by fierce aborigines, and reach the Irrawaddy River to engage in hunting. Mr. Yang previously found this animal in the area with the Roosevelt brothers in 1929, and it is now on display at the Field Museum in Chicago. This time, he is seeking it for the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology. Among the members of the American Youth Expedition Team are Emmons III and Loomis, both Harvard University students and skilled mountaineers. The peak they plan to climb this time is 25,645 feet high. If successful, it will be a groundbreaking feat in mountaineering. This mission is extremely exploratory, and all its equipment is prepared in Shimla, India, and transported to the foot of the mountain to set up camp. During the ascent, camps will be set up and moved along, becoming smaller and smaller as they reach elevations above 20,000 feet above sea level. Mr. Yang now believes that this mission can only be carried out during the few months of good weather after the monsoon season and before the onset of winter winds. When Mr. Yang arrives at his destination in Garhwal, the mountaineering expedition will likely be completed. Then, they will work together to seek golden monkeys. If they can obtain them, it will be a great contribution to science, and the trip can be considered worthwhile. It is said that this beast is very difficult to hunt, as they all live in deep mountains and dense forests, their movements are extremely agile, and they never descend to the ground from trees. When they want to drink water, they always connect their limbs like a long rope hanging from a tree. Once one end of the rope has quenched its thirst, it immediately climbs onto the tree and allows the next one to drink, and so on until everyone has drunk.</p>
<h3>Animal Protection Society Requests a Ban on Slaughtering During Animal Day, and Holds a Living Creature Protection Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>The China Animal Protection Society of Yunnan Road in this city, for the sake of Animal Day on October 4th, yesterday sent a telegram to the Ministry of the Interior, requesting that, following last year's precedent, a ban on slaughtering be ordered nationwide for one day. At the same time, the society will also hold a painting exhibition by various schools on the theme of protecting living creatures on that day. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the Municipal Bureau of Education, asking them to instruct the schools to participate enthusiastically. The contents are recorded below:</p>
<p>Ban on Slaughtering for One Day</p>
<p>Respectfully addressed to Minister Jiang of the Ministry of the Interior of the National Government: I have learned that October 4th is World Animal Day, which has been observed in Europe and the United States for a long time. It is because the hearts of modern people are becoming increasingly treacherous, and psychological construction is also a crucial plan. Moreover, treating animals as fellow beings has always been an ancient teaching. Therefore, on Animal Day last year, we telegraphed and received approval from your ministry, under Jing Zi No. 013879, to issue an order to all provincial and municipal governments nationwide to ban slaughtering for one day. People in various places, upon hearing this benevolent and enlightened decree, expressed their joy and gratitude. This year, we plan to request the same case, issuing an order to all provincial and municipal governments nationwide in advance, announcing to the people to stop slaughtering various animals for one day on that day, to promote benevolence.</p>
<p>Living Creature Protection Painting Exhibition</p>
<p>Respectfully, October 4th is World Animal Day, which has been well observed in Europe and the United States. It is because abstaining from killing and valuing life are sentiments shared by the benevolent, and protecting the weak is also what the wise should do. This year's Animal Day is approaching in an instant. In order to promote the intention of protecting living creatures and broadly elucidate the idea of benevolence and love, this society has decided to hold a painting exhibition on the theme of protecting living creatures in various schools in this city, so as to instill the idea of treating animals as fellow beings into the minds of the general youth and children, so that the noble virtue of protecting living creatures can be promoted and carried forward. In addition to sending separate letters to various schools in this city to invite participation, we are enclosing a copy of the methods for soliciting paintings and essays, and we are writing to your bureau, instructing all levels of schools in this city to encourage students to participate enthusiastically, so as to enhance their understanding and appreciation. We are full of anticipation. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education. Ye Gongchuo, Chairman of the China Animal Protection Society; Guan Jiongzhi, Vice Chairman.</p>
<h3>Abundant Cotton Harvests in Various Regions, New Cotton to Hit the Market in Mid-Month</h3>
<p>This year's climate has been moderate, with even rainfall, and cotton production in various regions has been abundant. New cotton is about to hit the market. According to the reporter of the Industrial News Agency, who inquired with the cotton industry, the price of cotton in this city has recently soared, increasing by as much as 40 or 50 cents compared to last week. The reason is that it is the beginning of the new autumn, and various yarn factories are actively rushing to produce new goods, with a greater need and brisk sales. In addition, at this time, old cotton is running out, and new cotton has not yet appeared, resulting in a situation where demand exceeds supply. This year, the cotton production in provinces such as Hebei and Shandong is very abundant, exceeding 4 or 5 million dan. Unfortunately, it is controlled by Japanese merchants, so Chinese merchants cannot go to purchase it. Fortunately, the cotton harvest in provinces such as Shaanxi, Anhui, Hubei, Henan, Shanxi, etc., is bountiful this year, increasing several times compared to previous years. Chinese merchant yarn factories do not have to worry about a shortage of raw materials. As for the time when new cotton will hit the market this year, it is expected to appear around the middle of this month. Political, I am full of anticipation, Ye Gongchuo, Chairman of the China Animal Protection Society, kowtows.</p>

<h3>Dispute Between Tax Police and Fishermen in Daishan, Ministry Replies to Two Fellow-Townsman Associations, Has Instructed Salt Transport Envoy to Handle, Fishermen's Representatives Telegraph Request for Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>Regarding the dispute between the tax police and fishermen in Daishan, the Ningbo and Dinghai Fellow-Townsman Associations telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting a method for handling the aftermath. Yesterday, replies were received from the ministry and the provincial government, stating that the matter had been handled by the Zhejiang Salt Transport Envoy. Fishermen's representatives again requested the Ningbo Fellow-Townsman Association to conduct a thorough investigation. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Ministry and Provincial Government Replies</p>
<p>(1) The Ministry of Finance telegraphed to the two fellow-townsman associations, saying: The Shanghai Ningbo and Dinghai Fellow-Townsman Associations are all informed. The telegrams on behalf of Yang and the cases presented by the Salt Administration are all noted. It has been found that this case was previously reported by Zeng and Zhen on behalf of Yang, and replies have been sent separately by telegram. Now, according to the Dinghai Daishan Chamber of Commerce's telegram, it is reported that the fishermen are in difficulty and requested a speedy settlement. A telegram has been sent to urge the Zhejiang Transport Envoy to conduct a fair and thorough investigation, and to carefully examine the local situation, and propose improvement measures to be submitted for approval. Please be informed. Ministry of Finance Branch Supervisory Seal. (2) The Zhejiang Provincial Government replied by telegram, saying: Shanghai Ningbo, Dinghai, and Shanghai Fellow-Townsman Association, Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Mr. Liu Hongsheng are all informed.

The government has forwarded a letter to the Zhejiang Salt Transport Envoy for filing and handling. In addition to waiting for a reply before further handling, this is a special reply. Xu Qingfu, Acting Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Jiang Secretary Two Seals.</p>
<p>Telegraph Request for Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>Fishermen's representative Yu Chuiyu yesterday again telegraphed the Yong Fellow-Townsman Association, requesting a thorough investigation. The original text said: Shanghai Ningbo Fellow-Townsman Association, it is learned that Zhang Zhongli, Director of the Zhejiang Tax Police Bureau, and Yu Bingxun, Deputy Director, collude and act as accomplices, harming the country and harming the people. We respectfully request that you forward the matter to Chairman Chiang, dismiss them from their positions, and conduct a thorough investigation. We respectfully list their illegal facts below: (1) Zhang Zhongli was originally a confidant of the remnants of the Northern Warlords. On the day he was transferred to Zhejiang, he brought with him many retired officers who had served as company and platoon leaders in the Northern Warlords. Not long after taking office, he used the pretext of cracking down on smuggling and reforming the system to dismiss and remove the tax police officers, in order to install his own people. At the same time, he secretly expanded his power, reorganizing the original officers and police into a patrol brigade. After the establishment of this brigade, they went to various places to survey important military passes and sell smuggled goods with the support of the masses. (2) Zhang Jintang, the current Director of the Third Tax Police District, is Zhang Zhongli's nephew. He incited his subordinates to collude with the patrol team to transport smuggled salt on the high seas and sell it around Liuhe. (5) Zhang Zhongli summoned the heads and team leaders of the various districts under his command to secretly meet at the Qintai Hotel in Hangzhou. The purpose was that the bribes collected by the officers in each district were too large, and they were afraid that the fishermen and salt merchants would file charges, so they decided on a countermeasure, adopting a uniform policy of interference. Before the tragic incident in Daishan, they colluded with Yu Bingxun to collect 7,000 yuan in illegal fees from the fishermen, causing a complete change in the situation. The fishermen's losses were countless. Afterwards, they did not quickly reflect and improve, and handle the matter carefully. Instead, they increased the number of tax police, arresting people and extracting confessions through torture. All the officers and police who came to Daishan were remnants of the warlords. After arriving in the area, they looted from house to house under various pretexts. The fishermen's property was almost empty. (4) Deputy Director Yu Bingxun had a humble military background and was good at flattery. Since his transfer, he has been engaging in corruption and assisting in all illegal activities. The salt industry once filed a complaint against him. Zhang Zhongli's thoughts were unfathomable, so he colluded with Yu Bingxun and engaged in corruption together. The Daishan tragedy was actually instigated by Yu Bingxun. If they are not investigated thoroughly and jointly, Zhang and Yu's power will be permanently solidified, and the harm to the government will be unspeakable. The representatives are pleading for the lives of tens of thousands of fishermen. Knowing that your association cares about the suffering of the people, we respectfully report the situation and request that it be handled accordingly, so as to relieve the people's distress. We are extremely grateful. Yu Chuiyu, representative of the Daishan fishermen, bows in winter.</p>
<h3>Zhou Shouyu, Who Returned from Studying in the United States, Returns to Guangdong</h3>

<h3>Tuberculosis X-ray Group Checkup, Statistics for Last Month's Checkup</h3>
<p>The Tuberculosis X-ray Group Checkup initiated by the Medical Committee of the China Anti-Tuberculosis Association and the Hongqiao Sanatorium has released the following report for last month's checkup: From the 11th to the 29th, the total number of checkups was 678, including 553 males and 125 females. The occupations were: 310 in the business community, 161 in the academic community, 20 teachers, 14 in the political community, 33 in the industrial community, and 134 unemployed. The results of the checkups were: 219 completely healthy, 283 with inactive pulmonary tuberculosis, and 95 found to have active progressive pulmonary tuberculosis, accounting for 14% of the total. In addition, 47 had pathological changes in the heart and aorta, and 34 were not recorded. Considering the above statistics, it is noteworthy that heart disease and vascular disease are not self-aware. It was only through X-ray examination that their pathological changes were discovered. In addition, among the 20 teachers, 9 had inactive pulmonary tuberculosis, accounting for 45%. Among the 125 women, only 35 were found to have old diseases, accounting for 28%. It can be seen that women's lives do not have the struggles and pain of men. Early diagnosis of lung disease is the most important task in tuberculosis prevention. However, how to treat it after detection, first, it must be modernized and rationalized, and second, it must be popularized and economized, which is a major problem in society. Now, in order to meet the needs of society, the hospital has specially established a lung disease clinic at No. A2, Daxi Road, with the highest equipment and the lowest price to serve the public. Dr. Li Zubai, MD from the University of Berlin, Dr. Gu Honglie, MD from the University of Hamburg, and Dr. Qu Songshou, MD from Tongji University, have been invited to serve in the hospital. It will be established soon. Brief descriptions will be sent upon request. As for the Tuberculosis X-ray Group Checkup method, you only need to purchase a registration certificate from the Shen Bao newspaper office in advance, with a fee of one yuan per person, and you can check it anytime according to the specified time, without having to wait, which is very convenient. In addition, the hospital's X-ray machine was just shipped to Shanghai last month. Not only is the penetration power very strong, but it also has the latest shock-absorbing equipment and all safety devices. It is heard that the municipal hospital will also have the same equipment in the future. Currently, the hospital's X-ray machine is most suitable for examination and diagnosis. Major newspapers are quite busy. It is learned that because Mr. Zhou has been away from Guangdong for a long time and many things need to be taken care of, he took the Desheng Wheel of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. yesterday morning at 8:00 AM to return to Guangdong. According to Mr. Zhou's words to the reporter before his departure, "I (Zhou refers to himself) have been abroad in the United States since May last year, and have been away from Guangdong for 16 months. The gains and opinions on protecting overseas Chinese that I have obtained from this trip have been contributed to the central authorities, please adopt and implement them. Now, because I have received repeated urgings from Guangzhou, I must urgently return to Guangdong to report on my duties. I am scheduled to come to Shanghai again before the 20th of this month to welcome Mr. Zhou Song, a tycoon of overseas Chinese in the Americas, and will accompany him on a tour of the country.</p>
<h3>YMCA Organizes Huangshan Travel Group, Passing by Hai Ning to Watch the Tide</h3>

His teacher cherishes his talent and has personally accompanied him on the piano, and compiled a song "Remembering Zhao Meibo". After graduating, Mr. Zhao traveled to major European capitals and held solo concerts, which were highly praised internationally. In the spring of 1934, he was invited by Goucher College and Broadway University in the United States to be a vocal music instructor. He also regularly broadcast solo performances on the National Broadcasting Company of America, and held concerts in New York, Washington, Chicago and other places. He was praised as a talented musical artist. Our ambassador to the United States, Mr. Shi Zhaoji, personally entertained him in Washington, and attended Mr. Morgenthau, the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, for a private solo concert. He has won the highest praise from the government and the public in Beijing, who believe that he is the only Chinese artist who can sing Western classical and most modern music theory.

Unable to refuse, he returned to China from the United States last month and took the position of director of the vocal music department of the school. His old friends in Shanghai, Fu Yanliang, Ye Qiuyuan, and Zhou Darong, set up a banquet at the Universal General Club on Jing'an Temple Road the night before to express their welcome. Among those who were invited to accompany them were also people from the literary and art circles, such as Zhu Yingpeng, Xu Weinan, Chen Baoyi, Liang Desuo, and others.

Because there are too many people receiving money, it is inevitable that there will be congestion. For the convenience of depositors, returns will be issued on separate days. Each depositor should immediately carry their debt certificate (deposit slip or passbook), registration certificate, and seal (this does not apply to those who have not left a seal) according to the date, time, location, and order of the following returns to receive payment. (1) Location of return: Tongyi Trust Co., Ltd., Beijing Road, Henan Road. (1) Time of return: From September 7th to 12th, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and from 1:30 PM to 4:00 PM every day. (1) Order of return: On September 7th, 8th, and 9th, fixed-term savings with predetermined interest, extra-deposit fixed-withdrawal savings, long-term increasing interest savings, fixed-deposit extra-withdrawal savings, correspondence savings, and fixed-term current savings will be issued. On September 10th and 11th, fixed-term savings and demand and time savings will be issued. On September 12th, current savings, gift certificate savings, temporary savings, demand extra-deposit lump-sum savings, special savings, 19th enrichment savings, and savings deposit remainder will be issued. Matters needing attention by each depositor: (1) If, on the above-mentioned dates, any depositor is unable to come in person to receive payment due to long distances or special circumstances, they should carry their debt certificate (deposit slip or passbook), registration certificate, and seal to the Tongyi Trust Company Liquidator's Office, Room 505, 5th Floor, 133 Mingyuan Road from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM every day starting from September 14th. (2) This time, one-quarter of the savings department's principal will be returned because the Tongyi Trust Co., Ltd. savings department has a savings guarantee deposit with the Central Trust Company. The receipt of this guarantee deposit must be issued by the Central Trust Bureau in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, the accountants and lawyers have already submitted a request to the Shanghai First Special District Court, and telegraphed the Ministry of Finance on Yandai to inform the Central Trust Bureau to issue the payment accordingly. However, if the Central Trust Bureau has not received the Ministry of Finance's telegram on September 7th, the payment date will be postponed until the Ministry of Finance's order arrives in Shanghai before it can begin.</p>

<h3>A Certain Lay Buddhist Talks About Reorganizing the Buddhist Association</h3>
<p>Recently, the Chinese Buddhist Association seems to have encountered hidden reefs regarding the matter of holding a representative assembly. Someone visited a certain lay Buddhist who is deeply versed in Buddhist Dharma and of high moral repute to ask for their opinion on this matter. Their words are as follows:</p>
<p>Although there are many followers of Buddhism today, the decline of Buddhist Dharma is increasing day by day. The main reason is that ordinary people are obsessed with power and unaware of their mistakes. Buddhists are also inevitably infected with this bad habit and abandon their duties. It goes without saying that ordinary ignorant monks waste alms food. Even those with more knowledge cannot avoid secular practices and like to talk about activities. Therefore, they talk about reorganizing temples every day, but the result is the opposite. Although Buddhism cannot but conform to secular laws, there must be a limit to concession. If one pursues fashion excessively and does not talk about cultivation, only seeking superficial splendor, it will inevitably lead to a name without substance. Although Buddhism is widespread, it is no longer Buddhism. If this disease is not eliminated, there is no solution. As for the government, it should have a thorough understanding of Buddhism and provide benevolent assistance and supervision, guiding it to the path of tracing back to the source and clearing the stream, and strictly prohibit it from seeking quick success and instant benefits, which is the right way to handle it. As for how to implement it to get to the point, it is possible to consult with monks and lay people who are detached from fame and wealth and have high moral character, choose the good and follow it, so that the public's hearts will be convinced and it will be easier to promote. Compared with rashness and coercion, the difficulty cannot be measured. Furthermore, the Chinese Buddhist Association is the central hub of Buddhism in the country. Whether the regulations are appropriate is of great importance to the future of Buddhism. All Buddhists will inevitably pay attention to it, strive to gain benefits and prevent losses. However, outsiders do not understand and often mistakenly believe that it is a dispute between new and old factions, and there are also views of supporting this and opposing that. The Chinese Buddhist Association is owned by all Buddhists in the country. Today, when Buddhist Dharma is declining, we followers are seeking to remedy and revive it and have no time to praise or suppress anyone, and then add partiality to it. Those who argue that we followers have different opinions, so they think that it is because we have something to help, which is inevitable to take people too lightly, look at things too easily, resulting in a prejudice against people, a wrong direction, the impact follows, it is a great pity. If, as the commentators say, our people's every word and action regarding Buddhism or the Buddhist Association are easy to involve the suspicion of taking sides, it is inevitable that we will not say a word about all major issues, and listen to its natural corruption, is this the original intention of the authorities? We deeply believe that the key to the reorganization of the Buddhist Association is not in the people, and we hope that the authorities will pay close attention to it, it is said.</p>
<h3>Seventy-Eight-Year-Old Man Arrested for Selling Counterfeit Money</h3>
<p>Wang Shuren, a seventy-eight-year-old man from Hubei, lived at 501 Yanjiaping, Zhabei, and worked as a teacher. Recently, due to whimsical ideas, he willingly stepped into the legal net, selling counterfeit money for profit. On the morning of the 29th of last month at 10:50 AM, he was peddling ten Central Bank one-yuan bills and two Farmers Bank one-yuan bills in the Dongyouheng Road area to Deng Hailin, a Chinese detective of the Huishan Police Station, saying that four genuine yuan could buy those fake bills. Just as he was delivering them, Detective Deng stepped forward and arrested the old man Wang. After searching his body at the police station, he found another counterfeit Central Bank one-yuan bill in his stocking. He then went to Zhabei with the local Public Security Bureau to search his house at Yanjiaping. Under a bed, they found three counterfeit Central Bank one-yuan bills. At this time, Wang's old wife, Zhong (70 years old), caught a glimpse of them and boldly stepped forward to seize the counterfeit bills. She was also arrested and taken to the women's prison of the Public Security Bureau. The old man Wang Shuren was sent to the First Special District Court. He confessed that the counterfeit bills were picked up on the tram from Laoximen to Gaochangmiao and refused to clearly state the source. He was ordered to be detained for further investigation.

In recent years, due to market stagnation and price-cutting sales among competitors, the factory's business suffered considerable losses. By the 6th of this month, it could no longer sustain operations, announced liquidation, and auctioned off the factory premises, machinery, and other assets.</p>
<p>3. Jinchangxiang Machinery Factory Closure: This factory was established around the 10th year of the Republic of China, with unspecified capital. It was jointly founded by Mr. Zhang Linxiang and others, employing over 60 workers and equipped with 20 large and small lathes, mainly manufacturing diesel engines. In recent years, due to the decline of various industries, the demand for machinery decreased, and the business gradually deteriorated, resulting in substantial losses. Despite Mr. Zhang's efforts to reduce its scale, it was still far from sufficient. Therefore, the shareholders decided to cease operations.</p>
<p>4. Lichang Machinery Factory Liquidation and Auction: This factory was solely funded by Mr. Luo Jinru, specializing in the manufacturing of sock-knitting machines. Its business was once thriving, but in the past three years, due to the impact of the economic downturn, its business declined significantly. Despite attempts to maintain operations, it proved impossible. Therefore, on the 11th, it announced liquidation and the auction of its machinery and assets.</p>
<p>5. Xiechang Glass Factory, Weiji Company, Liquidation: This factory was founded by Cantonese merchant Mr. Deng Zhongze and others. It was a joint-stock company that built its factory in Lane 163, Hujia Wooden Bridge, Zhabei, on a considerable scale. Mr. Deng served as the manager, specializing in the production of glassware. Its past business performance was excellent, but it was severely affected by the Shanghai War, nearly leading to bankruptcy. Fortunately, the person in charge effectively negotiated with creditors to convert debt into shares, adding Weiji to continue production. Unexpectedly, business had barely resumed when an economic downturn swept the country again, causing business to plummet. The future looked bleak. Mr. Deng had no choice but to agree with the shareholders to cease the production of glass and switch to manufacturing celluloid toys and utensils. After the production change, business still did not improve. Moreover, the factory's warehouse accidentally caught fire on May 26th, 1924, destroying three factory buildings and all inventory, resulting in losses of over 30,000 yuan. Faced with these successive blows, maintaining operations became extremely difficult. On the 25th of this month, it announced liquidation.</p>
<p>6. Lihua Xing Dyeing Factory, Zhongxing Printing Factory, and Jingxin Refining Factory Close Down: The former two were both affected by the economic downturn and could not sustain operations. Jingxin Refining Factory opened on April 5th of this year, with Mr. Pan Wenbin as the general manager, specializing in refining, bleaching, and finishing. However, less than two months after opening, Mr. Pan resigned, leaving the factory without a responsible person, and it announced liquidation. The crisis faced by the dyeing industry due to the extreme decline of the silk weaving industry has become evident.</p>
<p>7. Taifeng Biscuit, Candy, and Canned Food Company Resumes Operations: After being implicated by Huaming Match Company and announcing liquidation in December of the 23rd year, the company authorities petitioned the court to convene a creditors' meeting, which passed a compromise plan. The board of directors also raised 200,000 yuan in preferred shares and actively prepared to resume operations on the 9th of this month.</p>
<p>8. China Standard Milk and Soybean Milk Company Announces Liquidation and Auction: This company began preparations in the 23rd year of the Republic of China and was officially established in February of the following year. Its capital was set at 500,000 national currency. The director and manager was a Briton, Mr. H.W. Howele. Since its opening, its business had been poor. Although it issued 15,000 yuan in company bonds to try to save the situation, it was ultimately ineffective. In the spring of this year, the company's bondholders formed a committee to manage the company's operations in order to protect their interests, and they publicly elected Mr. Chen Youqing to oversee everything, and they suspended the soybean milk division. However, some shareholders separately filed a lawsuit in the British court, which ruled that all assets be sold and all debts be cleared by the original principal.</p>
<p>C. Retailer Aspect</p>
<p>1. Shanghai Fuxing National Goods Company Closes Down: This company announced its reopening on April 1st. After only two months, it suddenly claimed that the building was unsafe and temporarily ceased operations.</p>
<p>2. Wu Rongtai Flower Powder and Foreign Goods Store Liquidation and Auction: This company has been open for over thirty years. It was solely funded by Mr. Wu Chengzhang, specializing in the sale of scented powder and general merchandise. Initially, the store was a sedan chair shop. In the 24th year of the Guangxu reign, it switched to selling shoes, and in the first year of the Republic of China, it started its current business. It had earned profits over the years, but in recent years, due to the economic downturn, it repeatedly suffered losses. This old store of over thirty years also announced liquidation and auction on the 21st of this month. (End)</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Promotes Improvement of Education in Guangdong Province, Enabling Students to Advance in Moral, Intellectual, Physical, and Social Development, Creating a Civilized and Strong Modern Nation</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th) At 4 PM on the 5th, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek met with presidents and deans of various universities in the province at the Huangpu Headquarters. Those present included Deng Zhiyi, Dean of Academic Affairs and Dean of the Agricultural College of National Sun Yat-sen University, as well as Fan Qi, Dean of the Faculty of Arts, He Yanqu, Dean of the Faculty of Science, Liu Junheng, Dean of the Faculty of Engineering, Liu Zuxia, Dean of the Medical College, Zou Zhuoran, Secretary-General of the university; Zhong Rongguang, President of Lingnan University, as well as Yang Shouchang, Dean of the Faculty of Arts; Jin Huicheng, President of Guangzhou University, and Wu Zaimin, President of National University. Chairman Chiang expressed great concern for the situation of each school, making detailed inquiries. Afterwards, he had tea with Deng and others under the green shade of trees by the river. During the meeting, Chairman Chiang stated his hopes for the educational circles of Guangdong, briefly stating that the reform of society and politics depended on education being improved first, in order to see the effect of addressing the root cause. If education progresses, the academic atmosphere will be pure, the moral character of scholars will be upright, and transforming the people and shaping customs will be very easy. In recent years, I have traveled to various places, and for any reform, I must first awaken the teachers and general young students in the educational circles to serve society together, and the results are immediately visible. This time, with the renewal of the situation in Guangdong, I hope that in the future, Guangdong Province can become a model for the whole country in terms of politics, military affairs, economy, and education. Therefore, I earnestly hope that the teachers in the educational circles of this province can promptly rise up and work together to improve education, ensuring that students advance simultaneously in the "moral, intellectual, physical, and social" aspects, which is the most complete education. The first step is to especially emphasize moral education, using strict training to enable students to develop a disciplined lifestyle, maintain habits of discipline, and have a spirit of learning and patriotic ideas, creating a sound personality of a modern citizen. To achieve this goal, those responsible for education must strictly discipline themselves and lead by example. Therefore, the emphasis and improvement of teachers is an urgent task. Only with good teachers can there be good students. Only with good students can there be good citizens. Only with good citizens can there be a good society and politics. Finally, a civilized and strong modern nation can be created. After Chairman Chiang's speech, the presidents and deans of each school were deeply moved and successively offered many opinions on rectifying the academic atmosphere and improving education. They took their leave around 6 PM.</p>

<h3>Recent Four Years of National Central University (I)</h3>
<p>— Luo Jialun</p>
<p>National Central University is located in the capital, and the recent progress of its internal structure is likely to be of interest to the people of the country. Jialun took office on September 5, 1921, to organize and, in June 1923, published a brief report entitled "Central Events of the Past Two Years." In fact, what was described in that article, nominally two years, was actually the facts of the past nineteen months. Time flies, and another two years have suddenly passed. Now, I will re-examine and comprehensively review the facts of the past four years, listing them succinctly. Some small parts are still old records, and most are new additions. I will use objective phenomena and verifiable figures as measures, without involving judgment or exaggeration. It is renamed "Recent Four Years of Central University" to provide a reference for those who care about university education. As for the shortcomings in the process of improvement, there must be many. I hope that the worthy people of society will give guidance and correction at any time. I still remember when Jialun was ordered to take office, he said that to seek the reconstruction of Central University, it must follow the three stages of "stability," "enrichment," and "development." Fortunately, stability and enrichment have shown results. Since this year, the phenomenon of development has also been proven by facts. However, the foundation has just been laid, and there are still many difficulties ahead. Without the joint maintenance of the people of the country and the continued guidance and support of the wise government, it will be difficult to achieve complete success. If we can enjoy the stability and prosperity of the country, then after a few years, Central University should strive to live up to its responsibility as part of the cause of national rejuvenation. Now I present an outline to await instruction.</p>
<p>1. Reorganization of Departments</p>
<p>The school originally had eight faculties: liberal arts, science, law, education, engineering, agriculture, medicine, and commerce. The six faculties of liberal arts, science, etc., were located in the capital, and the two faculties of medicine and commerce were located in Shanghai. In 1921, the school was ordered to reorganize. After a decision by the Executive Yuan, the two faculties of medicine and commerce in Shanghai were made independent. The school then retained the six faculties in the capital. After Jialun arrived at the school, he felt that the department settings in the six faculties still needed to be reorganized. He considered the resolutions of the reorganization committee and the needs of the country and society, and merged the complex educational and social science departments, while restoring the departments that were more closely related to the actual needs of the country, such as the Department of Chemical Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering and the Department of Horticulture in the Faculty of Agriculture. The reorganization resulted in six faculties and thirty departments. The later added Medical College, Dental Specialty School, and Mechanical Special Research Class were not included. The Faculty of Liberal Arts was divided into five departments: Chinese Literature, Foreign Literature, Philosophy, History, and Sociology. The Faculty of Science was divided into six departments: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Geology, Geography, and Biology. The Faculty of Law was divided into three departments: Law, Political Science, and Economics. The Faculty of Education was divided into one department of Education and Psychology, and three sections: Art, Physical Education, and Health Education. The Faculty of Engineering was divided into five departments: Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Architectural Engineering, and Chemical Engineering. The Faculty of Agriculture was divided into six departments: Agronomy, Forestry, Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, Agricultural Chemistry, Horticulture, and Sericulture. This is the situation from the 21st to the 24th year. In the 25th year, the Ministry ordered the merger of the two departments of Sociology and Sericulture, and part of the curriculum was incorporated into other departments. Therefore, the aforementioned six faculties will be composed of twenty-eight departments. However, the divisions of the Medical College are not included here. Also, there are divisions in the departments, such as the Art Section being divided into painting and music groups, which are not listed here.</p>
<p>2. Addition and Expansion of Schools (1) Addition of Medical College</p>
<p>The government, recognizing the extreme shortage of medical personnel in our country and the scarcity of national medical colleges, had to establish a higher medical education institution in the capital. It ordered the school to add a medical college. The school also deeply felt the importance of medical education for national health and national defense. After receiving the order, it actively proceeded. However, the government did not allocate specific funds. The school had to do its best to save within the original recurring expenses to cover the recurring expenses and equipment of the college. The college began enrolling students and was officially established in the 24th year. The construction of the college's classrooms and laboratories has also been completed. In the next academic year, six laboratories for anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pathology, pharmacology, and bacteriology will be added to provide teaching experiments for the second grade. At the same time, in cooperation with the Ministry of Health and the Nanjing Municipal Government, a health experiment clinic will be established. The address is opposite the school. Part of it is the school's property, and part of it is the land donated to the school by Mr. Rong Desheng. The value of the land and new buildings is estimated at about 45,000 yuan. The construction of this project has now started. In the future, in addition to practicing at the Central Hospital, students of the college can also practice at the clinic at any time.</p>
<p>(2) Addition of Dental Specialty School The government decided to establish a national dental specialty school in the 24th year to alleviate the most common dental diseases of the people. Since the school had a medical college, it was designated to be organized and managed by the school. After receiving the order, the school actively proceeded. When the school enrolled students last summer vacation, the school also enrolled students at the same time and was officially established. All courses are closely connected with the School of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the School of Medicine, etc., and various basic subjects are shared by the respective schools. Experts are hired to take charge of the specialized subjects of the school. During the winter vacation, a training class for oral hygiene was added to train junior practical personnel for future oral hygiene in primary and secondary schools. In terms of equipment, since the school was established for one year, the cost of purchasing library instruments, models, and equipment has been nearly 140,000 yuan. A dental hospital is currently under construction. The plan has been finalized and will be started immediately. After completion, with the addition of various latest equipment purchased, it will become the only most complete and modern dental hospital in the country. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Overwhelming England, America Wins the Davis Cup: Colasa Reaches the Advanced Singles Final; Exhibition Match: Lin Shihua Wins a Set Against Carson</h3>
<p>After the sad news of the death of national tennis player Qiu Feihai overseas spread, Chinese and Western people mourned together. In particular, the impoverished situation of Qiu's family aroused the compassion of the tennis community. Since tennis veteran Hu Xiansheng proposed holding a memorial match, the Western Lawn Tennis Association and the French Chamber of Commerce have been willing to contribute to the charity. Therefore, the grand Qiu Feihai Memorial Match was held yesterday afternoon at the French Chamber of Commerce. Tennis fans not only enjoyed a visual feast but also contributed to a charitable cause. Visitors flocked in, and the east, south, and west stands were all packed, with an estimated attendance of over a thousand, no less than the day before. As a result, in the advanced singles, Colasa eliminated Forbes in three sets to one to win the right to the final, and will compete with Carson for the championship this weekend. In the international Davis Cup doubles, the American Carson and Squier unexpectedly defeated the best Shanghai pair, De Foe and Bonaventure, in three sets to one to win the championship, which was truly not easy. Finally, Lin Baohua and Carson had a special performance; Lin won the first set, and the second set was not finished due to the late hour. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Advanced Singles Semi-Final</p>
<p>Colasa Easily Defeats Forbes</p>
<p>A total of thirteen people participated in this year's advanced singles. Colasa advanced to the second week without effort, and then defeated Indicason in straight sets. Forbes also won the right to the semi-finals by using a "gum-like" style. When the two met yesterday, those in the know already knew that Forbes would lose. As expected, Colasa started with a very crisp style, winning two sets in a row with 6-0 and 6-0. Forbes resisted fiercely in the third set. Both players were of the "gum-like" type, and after a long stalemate, Forbes finally pulled back a set with 6-4. The fourth set was also quite exciting, but the final victory went to Colasa, with a score of 6-3. The overall result was three sets to one, and Colasa won the right to the final, scheduled to compete with Carson this weekend for the championship.</p>
<p>Davis Cup Final</p>
<p>Each Wins a Set; Autumn Colors Equally Divided</p>
<p>In the international Davis Cup doubles, the Chinese team unfortunately met the strong American team in the first week and was eliminated. The United States then defeated France to win the right to the final. The defending champion, England, was lucky to have a bye this year. After playing, it overwhelmed Portugal, which had defeated Japan in the first week, and advanced to the final week. De Foe and Bonaventure's doubles have been dominating Shanghai for a long time. In terms of strength, Carson and Squier are much inferior. Yesterday, the Anglo-American final met in the Qiu Memorial Match. Before the match, the prediction for the championship favored England. After the match, De Foe served first and attacked, but it was not smooth. The United States took a 2-0 lead. Bonaventure served and pulled back a game. The United States then took a 5-1 lead. Bonaventure won again with a serve. Squier failed to serve, and England chased to 5-3, but soon the United States ended the first set with 6-3. In the second set, from 1-1 to 4-4, each won a game, but the United States led each time, and each time with a serve. In the ninth game, Carson served, but with too many double faults, lost a crucial game, and England then exceeded to 5-4. After winning another game, it pulled back with 6-4, forming a situation where the autumn colors were equally divided.</p>
<p>Sudden Turn, America Wins the Championship</p>
<p>In the third set, the United States still took a 1-0 lead, and then led with 3-1. The British side also worked hard to follow. At this point, the situation was still very even. After the equality of 3-3, the American side took a sharp turn, winning three games in a row, ending the third set with 6-3. The final set was even more intense. England won the first game first, and the United States then exceeded with 3-1. Then each won a game, making it 4-2, still leading the United States. At this time, close combat was even more visible, and both sides went to the net to kill, with wonderful scenes repeatedly appearing. England won two games in a row and chased to 4-4 again. When De Foe served, it was as expected, and as a result, two sideline balls went out of bounds, and the situation was gone. In the last game, at 30-30, Bonaventure committed suicide by touching the net, and De Foe flew far out of bounds again. The United States then won with 6-4, reaping good results. At this point, with a score of three sets to one, the United States won the Davis Cup Championship.</p>
<h3>Lin Shihua Defeats Carson</h3>
<p>Shihua was defeated by Carson in the advanced singles semi-final the day before yesterday. Yesterday, they met again in a special performance, which attracted special attention. Carson had just finished the Davis Cup and still felt confident. Without fully resting, he took the stage to face Lin. After the match, Lin served first and attacked, still taking the backhand cut approach. In the first game, Lin's situation was excellent, but after equality, he went to the net twice in a row and was taken advantage of by Carson, so he turned defeat into victory. In the first game, Carson even gained a crucial game with a serve, and then led with 2-0. At this point, Lin had an excellent performance, and took advantage of Carson's double faults and wild shots, winning three games in a row to exceed with 3-2. After 5-3, Carson even chased to equality. Lin calmly responded and finally won the first set with 7-5. In the second set, Carson again won the first game first. After 1-1, Carson won two more games in a row, and then each won a game, When Carson led with 4-2, it was already dusk, and it was not finished, so the battle was suspended. Looking at Baohua's skills yesterday, his forehand draw was still weak and powerless, and the overhead smash at the net was still rare. Only the backhand draw was considered perfect, and the change of faults when serving should be two-thirds less than Carson's.</p>
<h3>Sportsman Yu Jinxiang Gets Engaged</h3>
<p>Sportsman Mr. Yu Jinxiang got engaged to Miss Peng Runyu at the New Asia Restaurant yesterday. Mr. Yu is a graduate of the Department of Physical Education of Central University, with rich knowledge.

<h3>Our Country's Team's Campaign Diary (12th Letter) Special Correspondent Feng Youzhen of the Central News Agency</h3>
<p>(5)(4) Basketball, Second Game: Victory Over France, Enters Second Week</p>
<p>In the basketball competition, a double round-robin system is adopted. The 23 participating countries are divided into eleven groups on the first day of the first week for competition. Another team has a bye. The eleven winning teams advance to the second week, and the eleven losing teams are regrouped for competition on the second day. The losers are eliminated, and the winners advance to the second week, just like the winners of the first day. Another draw will determine the order of the competition (if the two teams drawn have already met last week, the second name drawn will be replaced with the first name drawn from the next group). This process of elimination continues step by step until the last six teams are left, and then the top six rankings are determined. China was defeated by Japan on the first day, and met France, which was defeated by Iceland, on the second day. The victory or defeat was the key to whether or not to be eliminated, which was extremely important. As a result, our team won 45 to 38, and advanced to the second week like Japan, slightly venting the resentment of being defeated on the first day.</p>
<p>Basketball in European countries has not been around for long, and the skills are very immature. The French team is still considered to be among the best in European countries, but regardless of individual skills or the cooperation of the whole team, it is really mediocre. If we can show calmness and exert our inherent strength, the difference in scores should be at least 20 points or more. However, after the whole team was miserably defeated by Japan on the first day, their minds were lost and their spirits were scattered. After the start of the match, they were actually taken a huge lead of 10 to 2 by France. If everyone had not fought calmly later, perhaps they would have been eliminated in the first week, which would have been a very big joke.</p>
<p>Dizzy at the Start, France Takes the Lead</p>
<p>The competition was originally scheduled to start at 4:00 PM, but because the clothing of both teams was blue, the result of the coin toss was that France changed into the red jerseys prepared by the conference. However, the number cloth was not nailed, and it was not until 4:15 PM that the contact started. Our team flashed out with five generals: Mu Zuoyun, Wang Yuzeng, Wang Hongbin, Li Shaotang, and Wang Nanzhen. Wang Nanzhen got the ball and shot from a distance, launching two tigers, but working hard for nothing. The French team tried desperately, but also wasted their energy. Mu Zuoyun shot from a hundred steps, opening the record first. The French team had good luck, and the right forward took the opportunity to enter, tying the score. This person seemed to have a ball god possessed, and whether shooting from a distance or throwing from a close distance, he was able to do it with ease. In a short time, he took the lead with 8 to 2. China jumped the ball, and the center both fouled. Carelessly, everyone failed to score. The French left forward scored again under the basket, 10 to 2, killing me so dizzy that I couldn't even tell the business.</p>
<p>Fighting Bravely, Chasing to a Tie</p>
<p>Captain Wang instructed to consolidate, and the front line was active. Wang Nanzhen cleverly loaded ammunition, and Wang Yuzeng did not disgrace his mission and put the ball under the basket, just passing through the net. Wang Hongbin scored with a free throw, and then tried his hand again under the basket, 13 to 8, gradually catching up. The French team was strong and vigorous, and their momentum did not weaken. Wang Nanzhen missed twice, making a big mistake, 17 to 8, another nine points behind. Our team hurriedly changed players, Wang Shixuan came out to fight, and Wang Nanzhen returned home, and the battle line was renewed, and the momentum suddenly increased. Yuzeng made three more miraculous feats, and Shixuan and Zuoyun also knocked on the enemy's basket, 18 to 17, our team exceeded. The French right forward shot from a distance, and Wang Hongbin also returned the color, 20 to 19, still winning by one point. At this time, the war clouds were dense, the killing was full of energy, the air was very tense, and the interest was very strong. The French center shot the ball under the basket, when Li Shaotang stopped and fouled. Outside of two points, plus a free throw, the French team jumped to the lead again with 22 to 20. Wang Hongbin shot from a distance and missed, followed by a hit, and the result of the first half was a tie of 22 to 22.</p>
<p>From Bad to Good, We Take the Lead</p>
<p>After the break, the two centers each made contributions to their teams, and the scores were still equal. The French team's ball luck was prosperous, and the center scored twice unexpectedly, and exceeded by four points again. Our team hurriedly replaced Shen Yugong, and Mu Zuoyun and Xiao Shen appeared and disappeared unpredictably, and partnered with the two Wangs to approach, making great contributions. Hongbin did not lose the free throw, 29 to 28, standing out from the crowd. At this time, the cooperation was pure and skilled, and from bad to good, the three forwards appeared and disappeared in the enemy's formation, as if entering no man's land. The two guards attacked and defended, in an orderly manner. The three forwards scored three times in a row, 35 to 28, leading by seven points. At this time, the French formation shook, and they were panicked and confused. After the ball was thrown out of bounds behind the basket, it went straight through the opposing field, relying only on brute force, and the audience laughed.</p>
<p>Surprise Soldiers Stand Out, Complete Victory</p>
<p>However, the French team was proud and unwilling to succumb. They reorganized the team and transferred two reinforcements. Sure enough, they had a full aura and pulled back two points. After Wang Shixuan scored a free throw, the new right forward actually made a throw and a penalty, and the bullets were sure to hit, 36 to 33, gradually approaching, and then becoming 37 to 35, only two balls away. Wang Hongbin missed three good opportunities, and then redeemed his previous sins, laying the foundation for the overall situation. The French team fought fiercely, and chased again to 41 to 38. Captain Wang saw that the time was coming, and ordered to be steady and fight steadily. The ball was passed back and forth in the center line, and never moved forward, so that the French team was so anxious that they were furious, and tried desperately to grab it. However, after the formation was in chaos, the defense was empty. Xiao Shen and Da Wang seized the opportunity, and surprise soldiers stood out, and the basket used two wonderful plans, and Wu Yu closed the army, 45 to 38, and our team won.</p>

<p>(5)(5) Basketball Unexpected Setback, Third Battle Lost to Peru</p>
<p>In the second basketball match of the first week, after winning France, and advancing to the second week, the first match of the second week was played against Peru at 5:00 PM on the 9th. The Chinese and Peruvian teams had a friendly match on July 29, and as a result, our team won by a big score of 43 to 36, so when the draw was made on the afternoon of the 8th and it was decided to meet Peru, everyone was very happy, thinking that they could safely and steadily advance to the third week, but after 40 minutes of fierce fighting, our team was actually defeated by 21 to 29, which was really unexpected.</p>
<p>Peru's ball skills are indeed not very good. The reason for our team's defeat is not because Peru played well, but because we played too badly. Since being miserably defeated by Japan in the first game, the whole team seemed to have been hit on the head with a stick, their spirits were scattered, and their will was depressed. In the second game against France, although they fought with all their strength, they finally won, but the team members' physical strength was extremely exhausted. In the third day's battle with Peru, they had become the end of a crossbow and were powerless. Shooting and free throws were completely unassured, and dribbling and passing were also full of mistakes. In this situation, although Peru was weak, our team could only lower their heads and be captured.</p>
<p>Spirits Scattered, Initially Suffered a Small Setback</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM, the match started. Our team sent five generals: Wang Hongbin, Shen Yugong, Wang Yuzeng, Li Shaotang, and Wang Nanzhen to fight. In the center circle jump ball, our team adopted an offensive posture. Shen Yugong shot from a distance and missed, and Wang Hongbin also fired repeatedly without purpose. Wang's army advanced and was blocked, and passed to Wang Hongbin. Hongbin did not disgrace his mission and opened the record with a long-range shot with both hands. The Peruvian center was unwilling to be outdone and also shot from a distance in return, making it 2-2. Yuzeng's physique was abnormal and he repeatedly failed to score. Xiao Shen shelled under the bar, and the ball jumped out again after circling the basket. Ill-fated, a sign of defeat was lurking. On the contrary, the enemy's army scored with one shot, exceeding with 4 to 2. Yuzeng reluctantly made a tie, and the enemy's left forward scored with a free throw again. Xiao Shen disregarded his life and passed through the enemy's camp under the bar, raising his right hand, 6 to 5, and took the lead again. The enemy army launched a counterattack, and the center shot three times and made one penalty, with the score being twelve to six, a difference of one double. At this time, our army's spirits were scattered, and the formation was chaotic. Xiao Shen sacrificed two free throws, and then tried his hand again under the bar, pulling back two points. The Peruvian left forward was lively and agile, and took advantage of every opening. Two mountain cannons were fired again, making it sixteen to eight. Wang Hongbin snatched back a ball in the midst of great hardships, and at the end of the first half, sixteen to ten, I suffered a small setback.</p>
<p>Powerless, Finally Defeated</p>
<p>After the food, the army was reorganized and fought again. Yuzeng's physical strength was insufficient, and he was struggling to run. Xiao Shen was eager to win and also acted flustered. Our army hurriedly reorganized the team, Yuzeng retired, Nanzhen joined the front line, Feng Nianhua took over as the left forward, and Wang Shixuan guarded the rear. The Peruvian left forward scored under the bar, and Li Shao's penalty scored for the first time. At this time, the enemy's army was aggressive and launched a large-scale attack, scoring three balls in a row. Our team started by scoring one point by Hongbin's penalty, and the situation was even worse with twenty-two to twelve. The Peruvian left forward shot from a distance and scored again, and the center also did not lose the serve. With twenty-five to twelve, the victory was set. Our army tried desperately to counterattack, but could not do what we wanted. Li Shaotang scored a ball, and the Peruvian right forward immediately cancelled it out, twenty-seven to fourteen, still thirteen points behind. After Nanzhen scored a free throw, Xiao Feng broke the enemy's basket twice, chasing up five points. Just as he was preparing to work hard to become stronger, the Peruvian right forward gave him a great blow with a long-range shot. Although Nanzhen pulled back two points, but the time was up, and the score was twenty-nine to twenty-one, our army was defeated.</p>

<h3>A Perspective on the World Economic Recovery</h3>
<p>— Tao Gengsheng</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Since the world economic panic reached its peak in 1932, it has gradually recovered in recent years according to the cyclical economic laws. This trend has become quite significant recently.</p>
<p>Before September of last year, the focus of the world's economic recovery was on the rebound of industrial production and prices, while world trade showed no signs of improvement. This revealed a significant contradiction in the relationship between economic supply and demand, becoming a hidden reef in the path of recovery. However, from September of last year to May of this year, industrial production and prices continued to show significant progress, and the turnaround in world trade added new evidence to the economic recovery.</p>
<p>According to recent statistics, the industrial production index of major countries in the world in May of this year was 97.1 (Note 1), reaching the highest record in six years. The price index was 73.1 (Note 2), reaching the highest record in four years, which are both much higher than the annual average of last year.</p>
<p>The rise in world trade is a recent phenomenon, and the degree of increase is very moderate. According to the League of Nations Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, the trade volume index of 75 countries in the world in May of this year was 36.5, an increase of 1.7 compared to the average index of 34.8 for the whole year of last year. It is still far from the base period of 1929, only reaching 36.5%, but even this slight increase is noteworthy.</p>
<p>Because under the fierce tariff wars and currency wars of modern countries, world trade is bound by countless chains, and yet the total volume of trade can still increase, which shows how vigorous the domestic industrial production of various countries is.</p>
<p>Then, how can the industrial production of various countries advance vigorously? How can prices rise? How can world trade have a slight turnaround? Here, we should point out an important factor, that is, the military expansion and monetary policies of various countries.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Since 1933, the magnitude of military spending in various countries in the world has been unprecedented in history, except during the European War. Especially after the Italian-Abyssinian War and the German troops stationed in the Rhineland, all countries have unanimously revitalized their military preparations. The degree of military expansion and the tense situation are much greater than before the outbreak of the European War. We can get a glimpse of this by citing the military expenditure of several important countries. This year, Russia's military budget is £590 million, more than double that of last year, Britain is £180 million, the United States is £240 million, Japan is ¥1.06 billion, and according to the proposal of Japanese Army Minister Terauchi, a national defense strengthening plan of ¥2 billion is also to be established. Comparing these figures with the early stage of the European War will shock people!</p>
<p>The unlimited expansion of military spending, on the one hand, indicates that war is inevitable, and on the other hand, it stimulates the development of industrial production and the accompanying rebound of prices. Just look, the rising periods of industrial production and prices in various countries are roughly the same as the rising periods of military expansion. At the same time, looking at the content of industrial production progress in recent years, it is entirely centered on heavy industry, especially the military industry, which is increasing the fastest, while light industry has hardly made any progress. Therefore, although the industrial production of modern countries is becoming increasingly developed, it is detrimental to the lives of ordinary people.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>The second major factor causing economic recovery is the currency devaluation policy of various countries. Since Britain abandoned the gold standard in 1931, various countries have followed suit one after another, staging a widespread currency devaluation competition. Because currency devaluation can raise prices and invigorate finance domestically, and lower exchange rates and increase export trade externally, as a result, the domestic industrial production business has seen progress day by day. However, the rise in industrial production is still indirectly affected by the currency devaluation policy; while the rise in prices is a direct effect of currency devaluation. Because the value of currency depreciates, the prices calculated in currency rise. If we remove the factor of currency devaluation and calculate prices based on the pure gold content of the currencies of various countries, the price trend in recent years, except for a slight turnaround recently, has fallen sharply. This can be seen from the price index calculated in the following two methods.</p>
<p>1929    1932    1935    May 1936</p>
<p>Price index calculated according to gold price (Note 3)                                                                                                                                                          100.0    61.0    52.2    53.3</p>
<p>Price index calculated according to the currencies of various countries (Note 4)                                                                                                                                                       100.0    68.7    71.6    73.1</p>
<p>Since the influence of monetary policy on production, prices, trade, and other economic phenomena is very significant, when discussing the relationship between monetary policy and the world economy, countries with currency devaluation and countries with the gold standard should be observed separately.</p>
<p>Up to now, most countries in the world have abandoned the gold standard and implemented currency devaluation. The only countries that truly maintain the gold standard are France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. As mentioned earlier, the world economy overcame the abyss of the 1932 crisis and began to develop upward from 1933. This is a general statement, limited to most currency devaluation countries, especially the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, which have obtained currency advantages.</p>
<p>As for the gold standard group led by France, it happened to be the victim of the economic recovery of currency devaluation countries. Whether in production, prices, trade, or the number of unemployed, there is a sharp downward trend, and the economic crisis is deepening, with a sigh of "where will it end?" Therefore, Belgium resolutely abandoned the gold standard in March last year, while Germany and Italy, under the policies of controlled trade and controlled foreign exchange, were a disguised abandonment of the gold standard. Therefore, in the past year, Germany, Italy, and Belgium have been better in terms of production, prices, and trade, while France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland have continued to decline. The deterioration of the economic situation in gold standard countries has developed to this year, and the franc panic first broke out under the fuse of political turmoil, starting with the Rhineland incident, followed by the victory of the left wing, and finally with the nationwide labor unrest, each time causing a serious franc panic. The franc panic is proof of the economic bankruptcy of France, and if the franc cannot be maintained, it is proof of the final stage of economic bankruptcy in France, because the gold standard is regarded as the second life of the country in France.</p>
<p>Although the franc is still barely maintained, the spirit of the franc gold standard has gradually been lost, gradually following in the footsteps of Germany and Italy, implementing restrictions on foreign exchange and managing people's funds overseas. In addition, Switzerland also announced foreign exchange restriction orders on June 22 this year. However, restricting foreign exchange and managing funds is still not enough to solve the economic difficulties of the gold standard countries. France's recent production and prices have made progress under the economic restructuring policy, but the trade deficit has increased instead. Therefore, France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland will eventually have to abandon the gold standard. Once all countries in the world abandon the gold standard, the factors that originally stimulated economic recovery through monetary policy will disappear.</p>
<p>Now, we can understand how fragile the factors of world economic recovery are. Among these factors, there may be great crises hidden, pushing the modern world economy towards the path of destruction, such as military expansion competition, or the effectiveness of stimulating economic recovery has gradually disappeared, such as currency devaluation policies. Therefore, the economic recovery built on these factors is difficult to last, and the temporary rise in world trade is not optimistic.</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>Not only can we see the fundamental defects of the world economy in the reasons for economic recovery, but also from the financial and livelihood conditions of various countries, we can reflect the foundation of the world economy.</p>
<p>Japan, Germany, and Italy are first-class modern countries. Their economies, such as production and prices, have made progress last year, and on the other hand, the difficult living conditions of the people are intensifying day by day. Mussolini and Hitler call on the people to starve in order to strive for honor. Food is often in short supply in Germany and Italy, not to mention other enjoyment.</p>
<p>The United States is the richest modern country, but the unemployment problem is still very serious. The number of unemployed in May of this year was 11 million, which has not decreased compared to the end of last year. In addition, the unemployment problem is very serious in the United Kingdom, Japan, France, the Netherlands, and Austria. Only Germany has recently eased somewhat.</p>
<p>The serious unemployment problem reflects one aspect of people's livelihood, and the financial situation of various countries, which is closely related to people's livelihood, will give us a clear enlightenment.</p>
<p>Under the environment of military expansion competition in modern countries, huge budgets and heavy taxes have become a unanimous cry from the people who cannot bear the burden. The world's powder kegs, such as Germany, Italy, and Japan, and gold standard countries, such as France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, need not be mentioned. Even the American people are constantly issuing cursing remarks, especially after the recent drought.</p>
<p>In the budget proposals of major countries this year, tax revenues have generally increased, but the budget deficit has increased instead, and still has to rely on deficit public bonds to make up for it. Deficit public bonds are directly or indirectly taken from the general public. How can people's lives be improved?</p>
<p>The most serious fiscal deficits and the huge deficit public bonds are the gold standard countries and the invading countries. The center of the gold standard countries is France. Its public debt increased by 180 billion francs in the past year, and the total amount of public debt reached 340 billion francs. This year, under the new government's economic expansion policy, the fiscal deficit and the issuance of deficit public bonds can be imagined. According to the London telegraph on August 8, in the recent two months alone, France's fiscal expenditure has increased by 11 billion francs under this year's budget deficit, and at the same time, the Ministry of Finance has issued 10 billion francs of small short-term credit bonds. The issuance of small bonds has been promoted smoothly, and the government has therefore cited it as evidence of improved finances. In fact, a huge flaw has already been revealed here. The Bank of France and other commercial banks in Paris can no longer digest huge bonds, and the government has to turn to the general public to promote them directly.</p>
<p>In the invading country of Germany, its public debt has become a point of doubt. The figures published by various parties are not the same. According to the statistics of the Berlin Economic Research Institute, the total amount of Germany's public debt by the end of last year was 30.8 billion marks.</p>
<p>Italy's public debt last year was 61 billion lira. Due to the war against Abyssinia, emergency military expenditures, and financial difficulties, the government could not bear the interest on the public debt, so it issued 7 billion lira of low-interest new public debt to replace the old public debt. At the same time, the gold reserves of the Italian bank were about to run out.</p>
<p>Japan's public debt by March of this year was close to 10 billion yen, and the military still advocated adopting a huge public debt policy to cope with military spending. According to the Tokyo telegraph on August 24, Japan's budget estimate for next year will reach 3.2 billion yen, which is the highest expansion record in Japanese financial history.</p>
<p>In addition, the US public debt by June of this year also increased to US$34.4 billion, and there are also US$2 billion of state and local public debt not included. At the same time, the budget deficit increased from US$357.5 million last year to US$600 million this year. However, in terms of the national wealth, population, and people's ability to bear, the US finances are not as exhausted as those of France, Germany, Italy, and Japan.</p>
<p>Among the countries, the best financial situation is the United Kingdom. According to official statistics, the public debt has decreased from £7.8 billion at the end of last year to £7.744 billion in February this year. In the past year, the United Kingdom was the only country among the major countries with a fiscal surplus, which the United Kingdom is proud of. However, since the revitalization of military preparations this year, the budget can no longer be balanced. The budget deficit is estimated to reach £12,291,000, entirely due to military spending expansion.</p>
<p>In summary, the financial and living conditions of various countries are running counter to the economic recovery.</p>
<p>(V)</p>
<p>In addition to the increasingly dangerous financial and living conditions of various countries, the weak nations of the world have become victims of powerful countries. Abyssinia is the most recent obvious example, and there are countless other deep and chronic exploitations taking place. However, the exploitation of weak nations will not only cause international conflicts, but there will also be a day when the exploitation is exhausted. Italy cannot revive its economy by obtaining Abyssinia. Therefore, the world economy does not show a bright realm, and the knot of the world economic panic still exists - the gap between supply and demand cannot be eliminated.</p>
<p>Here, we should pay attention to an important emerging country. The Soviet economy is clearly superior to other countries in the world. Since the implementation of the two five-year plans, the speed of industrial production progress in the Soviet Union has exceeded that of other countries by more than four times, as shown in the following table:</p>
<p>1928    1936    Feb 1936    May</p>
<p>Industrial Production Index of Major Countries (Note 5)                                                                                                                                                             100.0    91.7    97.2</p>

<p>Moreover, the content of Soviet industrial production is the simultaneous development of heavy industry and light industry.</p>
<p>All countries in the world are worried about the unsolvable problems of overproduction and unemployment, but there are no such problems in the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>A Focus on Economic Construction</h3>
<p>— Cheng Shanglin</p>
<p>—Regarding the Possibility of Heavy Industry Construction...and Dispelling Doubts for Readers</p>
<p>This is a rehash of old news: the discussion about the focus of China's economic construction. In the past, the determination of principles for economic construction was divided into the following different schools of thought: A: Heavy industry. B: Heavy agriculture. C: Heavy commerce. D: Equal emphasis on industry and agriculture. Among these schools, the proposition of heavy commerce is fundamentally untenable, because commodities are either industrial products or agricultural products; prioritizing commerce is essentially the same as prioritizing industry or agriculture. Secondly, economic construction naturally means enriching production. Commerce is merely the formation of purchasing relationships in exchange, distribution, and consumption, and cannot be directly linked to the development of production. Therefore, few agree with it. Apart from this, there are those who advocate equal emphasis on industry and agriculture, which is a compromise between the heavy industry and heavy agriculture factions. Many agree with this school of thought, but it has lost the original meaning of "prioritizing." As for those who advocate heavy industry or heavy agriculture, their earnest attitude is quite admirable, but after careful consideration, they ultimately have the flaw of being biased towards theory and neglecting reality. A: Every utensil is extremely complex in its composition. For example, cotton yarn involves agriculture in planting and industry in weaving. It cannot be completed by a single department of production. B: There are no absolutely industrial or agricultural countries in the world. The island nations of England and Japan understand that they are not suitable for farming. However, they do not neglect the importance of agricultural issues. Japan's meticulous improvement of agriculture in Hokkaido and its strict protection and supervision of cultivation in Korea and Taiwan, as well as England's attention to agriculture in India and its promotion of agriculture in Ireland proper, all demonstrate that they have not neglected agriculture and are using colonies to remedy their natural agricultural geographic defects. Conversely, the United States and Russia can be said to be agricultural countries. However, their promotion of heavy industry has allowed both countries to catch up and surpass others. C: In China's case, agriculture is the fundamental issue for stabilizing people's livelihoods, and industry is a necessary measure for establishing the nation and ensuring its stability. Both are extremely important, so it is appropriate that many agree with the theory of equal emphasis on industry and agriculture. In addition to this, contemporary scholars have put forward other proposals. For example, in a recent article published in the first issue of the seventh volume of the *Quarterly Journal of Economics*, Mr. Li Quanshi advocated equal emphasis on industry, agriculture, and fishing. This can be said to be a further step beyond the advocacy of equal emphasis on industry and agriculture. However, in essence, prioritizing industry or agriculture, establishing the country through industry or agriculture, although inevitably biased or flawed, can ultimately be justified. But to say establish the country through fishing is simply incomprehensible. – Because China only has seven coastal provinces. Therefore, the so-called fishermen are merely engaged in a subsidiary industry due to the natural endowment of their geographical environment. As the saying goes, "Those who live by the mountains live off the mountains, and those who live by the water live off the water." The countermeasures are only (1) how to consolidate maritime defense and prohibit foreign ships from fishing in China's territorial waters and (2) how to increase navigational safety to protect the lives of fishermen and prevent them from suffering accidental sacrifices using scientific fishing methods. Apart from this, it would be an overreaction to think that the fishing industry must be given the same emphasis as industry and agriculture. Furthermore, the fishing industry is not included within the scope of industry and agriculture, nor are the salt industry and animal husbandry. Among them, the salt industry is even more important than the fishing industry. – If an emergency occurs and sea salt cannot be extracted, the entire country will face the danger of bland food. This danger exceeds that of the fishing industry. If we include industry, agriculture, fishing, salt, and animal husbandry, emphasizing the fishing and hunting economy of primitive tribal society alongside the capitalist economy of the industrial age, it would be a magnificent sight, but this is contrary to the meaning of "prioritizing." In fact, calmly speaking, the economic organization of a country—especially China, with its vast territory—is extremely complex. Prioritizing any one sector of production will inevitably make one appear naive and flawed. Here, I propose a principle: not to prioritize any one sector, but to focus on scientific production methods. The focus of economic construction is originally like this.</p>
<p>However, the so-called scientific production methods are not empty personnel reforms or the promotion of new ideas. Their actual implementation often relies on the support of heavy industrial machinery to replace human labor. Because (1) in the agricultural sector, using scientific methods for collective farming relies on heavy industrial machinery for irrigation, planting, and even rice milling and transportation. (2) In the industrial sector, the manufacturing of light industrial products cannot be done without heavy industrial machinery. The development of power industries such as coal, petroleum, and metal industries such as steel also relies on heavy industrial machinery. Furthermore, regarding heavy industrial machinery itself, if we believe that importing it from foreign countries is not a fundamental solution, then the manufacturing of machinery must also rely on the machinery itself to function. (3) In the fishing, salt, and animal husbandry industries, if we adopt scientific production methods, in addition to some technical improvements (such as animal husbandry), the use of heavy industrial machinery is also omnipotent and great for scientific fishing and scientific salt production. From the above, it is clear that the central issue of the so-called scientific production method is how to develop "the industry within industry," the industry that transforms agricultural, fishing, salt – or animal husbandry production methods, making it the heavy industrial machinery that is the original driving force of all production. In other words, the development of heavy industry is the original element of the development of all productive forces.</p>
<p>The importance of heavy industry in enriching production in China, which lags behind in production, and the focus of economic construction, have been described above. However, what about the possibility of its development?</p>
<p>Here, it should be understood that many things (such as the launching of national liberation struggles) are temporarily restricted and contradicted by "should or shouldn't" and "can or cannot." And many things (such as heavy industry development) are related to "should or shouldn't" and "can or cannot." – All that remains is the question of whether or not to do it. If you don't have the determination to do it and think it can't be done, that's just an excuse, a dodge. It's not that you can't do it, but that you don't want to do it! This is what we must not ignore or be blinded by when discussing economic construction. Now let's explain it one by one.</p>
<p>Many people inevitably make a mistake in their preconceived notions. They believe that China today cannot afford the development of heavy industry in terms of talent, materials, and finances. At first glance, this sounds very reasonable, but upon closer inspection, it is not so. (1) The so-called talent should be divided into two aspects: one is labor workers, and the other is engineering and technical talent. Regarding labor workers, it is of course not a problem in China today, where unemployment is extremely widespread. Moreover, the low wages and persistent hard work of Chinese laborers are unmatched in the world, so international industrial development also relies heavily on Chinese labor talent. This is no longer a problem. What about technical engineering talent? This issue should also be divided into two aspects. One is whether China truly lacks technical talent. If so, it can be borrowed from other countries. Moreover, the large number of unemployed talent in various countries (the so-called unemployed here refers to those who have job skills but no labor opportunities, which is different from the common meaning of unemployed in Chinese society) shows that there is no shortage of talent. Moreover, borrowing friendly talent in the nature of employment does not require any political treaties or backgrounds. There are already many cases of hiring foreign consultants in institutions. Furthermore, during the Russian social revolution, its international isolation was even greater than China's today, yet it was able to borrow unemployed engineering technicians from the then sharply and openly opposed enemy country—the United States—to help with the Five-Year Plan. Can't China do the same now? Secondly, although the so-called engineering talent is relatively scarce, it cannot be said that there is none. However, they are not known to society or are not good at dealing with the current society, resulting in many being buried. Geologists do not necessarily have to be V. K. Ting or Weng Wenhao, but these two gentlemen have status and reputation in society! Chemists do not necessarily have to be Wu Yun Chu or Fan Xudong, but these two gentlemen are successful and have established a solid foundation in society. In the past, Chinese social ethics were implicated by bad politics, and there were many cases of mismatched talents and wasted talent. To say that China lacks talent based on this is to chase the tail and not seek the root. Moreover, talent must be cultivated from practice. It is futile to wait for the emergence of engineering and technical talent without engaging in heavy industry construction. Is that possible? (2): Regarding the capital issue, it is a fact that the Chinese government's finances are difficult today, and it is also a fact that private funds are more depleted than before. However, if you think that there is no capital for heavy industry construction, that is worrying unnecessarily. First of all, we should understand that capital flows downwards, running towards profitable areas. In the past, inland industrial zones could not be established, and mines not only could not be developed but were often affected and went bankrupt. The reasons for this, in addition to the years of internal strife and the early arrival of foreign machinery that could be sold in China, were that private funds invested in urban housing construction and underwriting public bonds, which had better interest rates and considerable guarantees (such as domestic public bonds having guarantees and housing construction in cities—even concessions—not being affected by internal wars and even increasing in price due to internal wars). This is one reason. In the social atmosphere and environment at that time, production construction and heavy industry development naturally did not cater to the psychology of the Chinese people. Conversely, foreigners, in that kind of turbulent society, on the one hand, had treaty guarantees backed by their military forces, and did not worry about suffering any losses due to China's internal wars. On the other hand, their economic aggression against China, which was more political than commercial (please note the complexity of the four words "economic aggression" here), was like mercury seeping into the ground, leaving no hole untouched. Therefore, every time there was internal strife, Chinese ships, fearing being detained by local warlords, stopped operating, while foreign ships could take advantage of this opportunity to develop shipping. Chinese mine owners stopped operating due to internal strife or went bankrupt due to bearing local public bonds and military needs, while foreign-invested coal and iron mine owners could take advantage of this opportunity to acquire and merge Chinese-owned mines. (At this time, Chinese people were fortunate to be able to sell their mining rights and recover their capital.) As for the one or two machinery factories, the poor management of personnel and the lack of scientific talent were certainly one reason. However, in general, in reality, due to the shortage of funds, private investment was impossible under government control—and they were unwilling to invest—which prevented development. We cannot use the large number of poor people in China today as an excuse to say that there are no funds. May I ask, has bank capital not been singing the praises of returning funds to agriculture in recent years because of excessive expansion (please see the recent years' business reports of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank to know)? May I ask if the future development of China's emerging industries, where there are profits to be made, is not flourishing? (Such as the development of the film industry, the increase in small and medium-sized banks, and the smooth sale of railway public bonds in recent years.) Conversely, China's poverty is fundamentally due to the lack of development of heavy industry, which cannot lay the foundation for industry. (Aside from political internal wars.) Moreover, in the mining industry, "for example, the Shaanxi-North petroleum mine is widely distributed in the extension area, and a new well can be opened for about 10,000 yuan. Of course, success or failure is not guaranteed, but according to previous experience, three or four out of ten wells have a hope of success. But organizing an empty consideration team costs 100,000 yuan at once. How about using this fund to do some practical work? If you want to spend tens of thousands more yuan, it is often not worth it" (Mr. Weng Yongni's words, see the previous 40th issue of *Independent Review*). Moreover, China's light industry has been developing for at least three to five decades, but because it lacks heavy industry to lay its foundation, it is now even more depressed? Moreover, the price paid by Chinese people for purchasing automobiles, machinery, airplanes, and munitions over the years is enough to establish several heavy industry factories and more. (Please check the cost of imported heavy industrial products in the customs records since the Republic of China, and the number of imported ships and automobiles in recent years to know.) Next, let's talk about government finances. It is a fact that the government is running a financial deficit today. But to think that the establishment of a heavy industry factory requires a contract with British or German merchants to borrow money is one-sided. Every time there is internal strife in China, the military expenses spent can probably establish at least a dozen heavy industry factories. In Beiping alone, there are many universities, and the annual education expenses cost 3 to 5 million yuan. If they can be merged into one or two universities, the savings can also establish two or three factories. (May I ask if higher education is important, or is it more important to enrich national strength and economic construction?) Other examples are too numerous to list and are also inconvenient. Paying each person an annual salary of 10,000 or 20,000 yuan to support a large number of personnel who sit in imported cars all day long, paying each person a teacher's salary of 5,000 or 6,000 yuan to support a class of so-called professors who teach for three or five hours per week and whose class size cannot exceed ten students (sorry old friends, I apologize to you, I am polite!), these national funds can be tightened and saved to be used as the expenses for the wages of thousands of workers in heavy industry factories. How can this be compared to the claim that financial difficulties make it impossible to establish heavy industry factories?! (3) Here, we should talk about material resources. Yes, I once heard a Shanghai professor say, "The deeper the degree of modernization, the more China sees its shortcomings." We should respect this statement, and it is reasonable. Because the large number of imported goods is enough to prove it. Moreover, the northeast, which has the richest iron ore, has already broken away from the protection of Chinese political power. However, material deficiencies and whether China should industrialize are two different things. And in reality, iron ore is indeed slightly scarce, but compared to neighboring Japan, it is probably still slightly better! Why do they and what about China? If the iron sand of the Hanyang Iron and Steel Company were not bound by loan agreements, then the production of this iron sand would be sufficient to temporarily supply China's needs for iron smelting. Other resources such as coal account for the third largest reserves in the world, and the storage and exploitation of petroleum are at least enough for China to be self-sufficient and have a surplus. (According to a foreigner, it is enough to supply the whole world for 2,500 years?) Can this be said to be a lack of resources? – What is lacking is only scientific talent and scientific machinery. But this is not something that heavy industry construction cannot achieve. Moreover, the exploitation of mineral deposits and the extraction of resources from the ground have infinite benefits, and as long as there is no corruption, there is no need to worry about losing money. How can it be said that material resources are not sufficient? – If material resources are really insufficient and we talk about heavy industry construction, then I am really crazy. – Moreover, if China cannot be self-sufficient in petroleum and coal, or if there is no partial storage and accumulation in peacetime, then in an emergency, the source of petroleum will be cut off, and the highway will become an empty road. Coal cannot be transported, and the railway will become a dead end. Is this something that can be dealt with by taking precautions?</p>
<p>In summary, the establishment of heavy industry factories in China is necessary and possible. However, some Chinese people may think that this is just the mining industry and cannot be called heavy industry. Because heavy industry must be like the Pittsburgh industrial zone in the United States, the Krupp factory in Germany, and the industrial zones of Yokohama and Osaka in Japan before we can talk about the development of heavy industry. Then here I want to tell him that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. China should start from the beginning when talking about the development of heavy industry now. This is a matter of fact, not a theoretical issue. Accumulating over time, we can talk about development. There is no reason to expect success overnight? However, it is true that China should be making efforts in this direction now. Writing here, I want to try to discuss the so-called "surplus labor" problem in a certain newspaper. First of all, I must state that I am one who does not ask about the position of the newspaper, but only asks about the text itself. Although I do not want and cannot state the name of that newspaper, I disagree with their belief that only agricultural cooperation can create surplus labor and that only surplus labor can lead to economic construction. I agree with cooperative undertakings, but I must reserve "cooperation is omnipotent," and I dare not agree with this point. Then let's talk about surplus labor. I don't know whether they are referring to surplus labor power or surplus labor accumulation when they refer to surplus labor. If it is the former, then China today is no longer comparable to the era before the opening of the sea ban. Before the opening of the sea ban, because productivity could be self-sufficient and semi-self-sufficient, the national life was entirely stagnant in a static and fixed society, limited by manual farming labor, and there may have been a lack of surplus labor power. But today, it is different. Here, it is not a question of whether or not there is surplus labor power, but of how to place the distorted surplus labor power due to unemployment in all industries due to the dumping of foreign goods. Therefore, the so-called surplus labor, if referring to labor power, need not be discussed. What about surplus labor accumulation? It is true that China today is poor and exhausted, and the country's annual income and social wealth are not as good as before. But this is the result of decades of indemnities, land cessions, and trade deficits. The countermeasures are no longer purely personnel improvements or cooperation that can help. In addition to the description in the capital issue mentioned earlier that the development of heavy industry does not necessarily worry about the lack of funds, which is enough to answer the opinion of surplus labor accumulation, I further say: If China does not develop heavy industry and replace manpower with machinery, then it is really impossible to increase the social wealth of surplus labor accumulation and the national annual income. Manpower is no match for scientific production methods. Even if we talk about frugality and cooperation, what can it do? If you think that the so-called agricultural cooperation refers to economic assistance and development cooperation, because this is the only way to have labor accumulation, then I can only admit that I am unlucky and call myself unlucky.</p>
<p>However, there are also patriotic youths who believe that heavy industry development is impossible, then I have to point out the errors and remind them of their obsession. China today, if you don't advance, you retreat, and you can no longer hesitate. What do you readers think?</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: American Cotton Falls More Than Ten Pounds – Only British and Indian Cotton Rise Due to Speculative Purchases –</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with good news from Liverpool and Mumbai. There was active buying from the Far East and Liverpool. Brokers saw that cotton estimates were decreasing, and short positions covered, with each month rising six to ten pounds. Then, with increased hedging sales from cooperatives, spot traders sold Texas cotton before the report was released. At the same time, private reports indicated heavy rain in northwestern Texas and scattered rain in Oklahoma, causing prices to fall sharply. The closing was weak, with spot prices down thirteen pounds and futures down twelve to fifteen pounds. British cotton spot and futures both rose nine points. Indian cotton initially rose due to speculative buying and cross-market purchases by cotton merchants, then weakened due to profit-taking. Finally, with speculative buying again, market prices rose again. Bengal rose three rupees, Oomra rose 3.75 rupees, and Broach rose four rupees. Original telegram left, (5th telegraph)</p>
<p>According to the Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for the 7th was: Broach at 213.5 rupees, down 2.75 rupees; Oomra at 191 rupees, down 2.75 rupees; Bengal at 155 rupees, down 2.75 rupees.</p>

<h3>Securities: The Bond Market of the Past Week in a Waiting-and-Seeing Mode Between Bulls and Bears. Market Prices Were Only Between Five Cents and One Dime High and Low.</h3>
<p>Last week, August 31st to September 5th, the changes in the environment of the Chinese Securities Exchange were quite tense, but the public debt market showed an aloof attitude and was not influenced by the current situation, breaking away from the habitual following of the tide. Since the resolution of Guangdong, the unification that had been hoped for for more than ten years is about to be realized. The unusual actions in Guangxi are only a minor issue and can be resolved in the short term. The Chengdu incident is not expected to expand. The bulls are holding firm, while the bears still have a schadenfreude mentality. Therefore, market prices may have more active advances and retreats from this week onwards. The past week was uneventful, and the market situation was sluggish, which has not been seen in months. There was no rise or fall, so what trends can be said? The stagnant situation has not been broken throughout. The stalemate between the bullish and bearish sides is extreme. Daily fluctuations were between five cents and one dime. The number of transactions has also gradually decreased due to this. Summarizing the results of the week, market prices still showed mutual highs and lows, only differing by five cents to one dime. This month's Class A bonds were the highest at 2.5 dimes. 96 once broke through the ten-dollar mark, but then broke down again, resulting in only a 5 cent rise. The total number of transactions was 16.3 million, with 96 accounting for 4.32 million. The results of the rise and fall are compared in the table on the left, (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of twenty-two or three batches of goods arrived, with a total of more than 4,000 piculs. Sales remained sluggish. Bounded parcels from Dalian and Qingdao were about 400 bundles, so the market continued downstream. Thick early japonica rice prices were cut by about a dime, and thin rice varied beyond a dime. Yin bianyuan rice did not fluctuate much. East new japonica rice arrived in increasing amounts, and the prices fell again, with factory new rice at a dime and river bottom two-foot rice. New yangchuan and other pointed rice varieties continued to fall by two to three dimes.</p>

<h3>North-South Goods: Shima Longan Meat Drops by More Than Ten Yuan</h3>
<p>Shima sun-dried longan meat, among all goods, has the largest pieces. The best are those with a bright red color and are sufficiently dry. The first batch of new products this time was all self-managed by the firms, and the quantity was small. Because the cost of procurement was high, the profit was limited, and there were even losses. The second and third batches have also arrived, but although the quantity is not yet large, the market is greatly weakened by the influx of Guangdong goods. Therefore, the market price has actually dropped by more than ten yuan, and further decline is still feared.</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Zhang Feng)</p>
<p>One should seek broadness in learning, wide connections in friendship, and accumulation in money-making, but narrowness is advisable in matters of the heart.</p>
<p>According to economic principles, everything in the world can be valued, and matters of the heart are no exception.</p>
<p>For example, if your love is spread among ten people of the opposite sex, it may seem worthwhile and victorious at first glance. But consider it yourself! If your love spread among ten people of the opposite sex, assuming each one's value is 1,000 national currency units, then the total for ten is 10,000 yuan. Doesn't it seem like quite a loss? However, if you take that love that is divided among ten people of the opposite sex and concentrate it on one person, then that love will be worth at least 100,000 national currency units!</p>
<p>Don't believe it? Just think of the couples of old who delivered meals to the fields and respected each other as guests, the couples who lived in thatched huts and raised their eyebrows in mutual respect, the couples who ran taverns and worked together in business, and other good couples whose relationships were fulfilling and whose stories have been passed down. The value of their mutual love is not just ten or a hundred times greater than the behavior of those who are fickle and never succeed in love, yet still boast of being amorous seeds.</p>
<p>Try it, this method of concentrating love like economic resources!</p>
<h3>Fake Bellies</h3>
<p>— Sleeping Buddha</p>
<p>Although both use artificial fake bellies, this kind of fake belly is definitely not the same as the farcical act of those wealthy families who, because they still lack offspring, fear that their large fortune will have no one to enjoy.</p>
<p>I am not qualified to pity others, but every time I return to my hometown and see this kind of thing, it lingers in my mind for a very long time, finally forcing me to write it out.</p>
<p>Those women who "sun the sea" for a living and are despised as "sea-head women" need no mention. Even women far from the beaches, in this era of rural bankruptcy, machines taking away manual labor, and men mostly suffering unemployment, are forced by the pressure of life to sell the more profitable smuggled salt. But when smuggling is strictly controlled, they are not allowed to carry it on their shoulders and backs. Moreover, women's strength is limited after all. They cannot carry large quantities of smuggled salt on their shoulders and backs, no matter how they pack it. It is difficult to escape the sharp and experienced eyes of the smugglers. So, after secretly buying twenty or thirty catties of salt from families who sun the sea, they gather together, put it in specially made cloth bags, tie it to their bellies with cloth strips, and carry some oil bottles and bamboo baskets in their hands, pretending to be pregnant. This method could deceive for a while at first, but later, because there were too many women with big bellies, it aroused the suspicion of clever smugglers. Once searched, this secret was discovered. Fortunately, some more sympathetic smugglers, seeing how pitiful they were and the small amount they were smuggling, were mostly willing to show mercy and let them go. So they still have to rely on this fake belly to maintain their intermittent lives. However, when they hurry on the road, because of the urgency and fear, they are sweating all over. The sweat drips into the salt and turns into brine. By the time they reach their destination, their entire bellies are soaked. First, it appears pale white and throbs faintly. Over time, the skin on the belly peels off in patches. This situation is so painful! Yet, to eat, they still pickle their bellies like salted meat every day. Alas!</p>
<h3>Rambling Talk About Goldfish</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>Goldfish are loved for their special colors. Buying a few and keeping them in a glass tank, one often finds them stiff and dead before the day is over. People then think that goldfish are delicate and difficult to raise. How can they know that clear water in a glass tank, with three or five colorful fish placed inside, seems to provide them with a leisurely environment, but everyone fails to understand that glass is transparent and excessively sensitive to light? Fish in it have many obstacles. Fish initially do not know there is water, just as humans have never seen air. Their eyes, which cannot open and close, crash into the light. Goldfish in glass tanks are difficult to keep alive, not because they are injured by crashing. Generally, fish fed in sandy tanks cannot eat after changing to clear water (to make them eat quickly after changing to clear water, just add a little old green water after changing the water). Moreover, the clear glass tank is like a mirror, because the surrounding glass panes are strongly sensitive to light, creating heavy barriers, which violate their way of life. People also feed them without stopping (actually, goldfish can starve but not starve to death). Water fleas cannot survive in clear water and die within three or four hours. If the fish have already eaten them, it is fine; otherwise, the tank water will stink, and the fish will float to the surface and cannot stay longer. If people know this and change to boiled water, that is fine; otherwise, they are also doomed. Furthermore, oily food is even more unsuitable. Even rice and porridge grains should only be given a small amount each day. Wait until they have eaten it all before giving more, because too much will cloud the water, which is also not good for the fish. Therefore, I say that today's glass tanks on the market (except for flat, square tanks) are fundamentally unsuitable for raising fish. If the tank opening is wide and the water is mixed evenly, they can still be kept for a little longer. If the opening is small and the water is cloudy, they will definitely die. Is there a solution? Yes, clear water should be mixed with green water so that the color appears light green. When feeding,撈 them out into a washbasin or sandy tank separately. After they have finished eating, 撈 them back into the glass tank. This can reduce the mortality rate. If you don't believe me, why not try it? (I am currently in the process of sampling and customizing glass tanks suitable for raising goldfish with a certain glass factory and will present them to the world.) It is best to prepare a small sandy tank outside. Those who want to use them as indoor decorations can only change a few fish each day for display. Every night, they should still return to the sandy tank to reduce damage. However, the size of the fish must also be proportional to the volume of water in the glass tank. If they are too large, it will be difficult for them to stay even for a short time.</p>
<h3>The Phoenix Returns to Its Nest</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 6: The Iron Face Shows Parental Love, Words Deceive the Parrot; Delicate Eyebrows Harbor Chivalry, Questions the典崑崙</p>
<p>Xiao Ju said, "Although the master is strict, he has never beaten Miss." Menglan said, "Alas! What do you know? I would rather be beaten than live this kind of life." Then she stood up, went to the washstand, and wiped her face with cool water. She also combed her hair with a small comb. Turning around, she asked Xiao Ju, "Are my clothes wrinkled from sleeping? Help me smooth them out." Xiao Ju said, "Change into another set. The back of your clothes has many wrinkles from sleeping. The master will scold you again when he sees them." Menglan did not object to this, took another piece of clothing, changed into it inside the mosquito net, and then stood in front of the mirror, buttoning each button one by one. She also touched her collar and tugged at her lapels. Everything was arranged properly, and she went downstairs to her mother's room. Just as she reached the door, she stopped, called out "Father," and then slowly walked in. At this time, Jiang Haoran displayed all his righteousness. Not a trace of a smile could be found on his face. Without saying a word, he looked at Menglan carefully with a stern face. Menglan stood quietly, lowering her head slightly. Haoran nodded slightly and said, "Sit down. I have something to say to you." Menglan looked at her father and then at her mother, and sat down on a chair opposite them, half sideways. Jiang's wife said, "Your father called you out, but there is nothing important. Just a few principles of conduct to tell you. Actually, you are very sensible from reading books, so of course you know about conduct, but it's just a reminder." Menglan felt unnatural listening to her mother's words. It was understandable that she felt uneasy in her heart. Therefore, she lowered her head even more, as if she were praying in a church, her heart resting entirely at God's feet. Haoran coughed twice before continuing, "I want to state first that I am not the kind of stubborn parent that young people think I am. Otherwise, would I send you to school to study? But I think a person should uphold old moral principles and think about things from a step back in order to be able to handle affairs calmly and find a kind of joy. For example, our family is naturally very different from those wealthy families. However, we can think about it from a step back and realize that there are those who are not as well off as us, who cannot even take care of eating and clothing. Then we will feel at ease in our hearts. I heard that you are unhappy and often complaining. I don't know where your complaints come from. I think you are a female student when you go out and a young lady when you come home. What else is there that would make you complain?" Menglan lowered her head and did not answer a single word of her father's question. Seeing that she did not speak, Haoran smoked two pipes of water pipe. The only sound in the room was the sound of breathing and smoking the water pipe. Everything was silent. It lasted for about two or three minutes. (70)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Talk</p>
<h3>Calling Cicadas</h3>
<p>— Xia Fei</p>
<p>A few days ago, a porter brought a load of calling cicadas to our door. These calling cicadas were all contained in a bamboo cage, but this bamboo cage had no door. To get them out, one would have to destroy the cage. They could only be confined to the cage forever until they died. But they did not know sorrow, and they lively转动 around in the limited space and喳喳喳 cried.</p>
<p>Because the child kept clamoring for them, I bought two. The child was very happy to hang them on the upstairs window and also went to find some thatch pods and rice gruel to feed them. I thought these two calling cicadas looked somewhat like grasshoppers and also somewhat like locusts. Their chirping sounded somewhat like cicadas and somewhat like textile girls. It is said that people in the countryside catch calling cicadas at dusk or in the early hours of the morning, using nets to chase them in the pumpkin vines.</p>
<p>The two calling cicadas we bought could chirp very well, and they chirped even more vigorously when it was hot. Whether at late night, dusk, or daytime morning, they always 喳喳喳 cried, without fatigue or thirst. Although their bodies were imprisoned in a hexagonal cage with only small holes, forever unable to get out, they seemed unaware and, like optimistic poets, sang in chorus. Perhaps they were singing some happy song. But I don't understand why calling cicadas sing; is it for love, or for life? For boredom, or for happiness? Are they praising summer, or cursing mankind? I will never understand why they sing. Perhaps it is just like humans groaning without illness!</p>
<p>Originally, I didn't pay much attention to insects, but since I bought these calling cicadas, I feel that these small animals are really lovable.</p>
<p>Calling cicadas are probably afraid of the cold, so when the weather gets a little cooler, you no longer hear them singing day and night. Moreover, they lose their lively姿态 in the cage. The child was very disappointed when he saw them, thinking they were sick. Therefore, he put them in the dew grass and then in the sun, like a mother worrying about her child's life. However, it was still useless.</p>
<p>One evening, the weather suddenly turned hot again. The calling cicadas, which had been hanging on the window and almost forgotten, happily sang in chorus again. — The child heard their chirping and woke up from his dream, extremely happy.</p>
<p>This child is a bit strange. He doesn't like any toys, but he is very fond of those calling cicadas. He has asked many people about what they eat.</p>
<p>"What do calling cicadas eat?" He would ask almost everyone he saw. Later, the coachman A Han told him that calling cicadas eat pumpkin flowers. So he clamored every day for his mother to buy pumpkin flowers, but no one in the city grew pumpkins, and there was no place to find pumpkin flowers. Although his wife had entrusted the country people selling vegetables in the small vegetable market, it was eventually forgotten.</p>
<p>That day, I went to Zhenru to visit the Rural Education Experimental Zone and the Ellen Goat Milk Farm and picked a few pumpkin flowers in the fields on the way, which finally satisfied the child's desire.</p>
<p>The child is too much like me and also like his mother. He has a deep attachment to old things. It is said that calling cicadas not only chirp nicely but can also ward off痧, so his wife also loves them very much.</p>

<h3>Friends and Women</h3>
<p>— (Zi Ying)</p>
<p>Anatole France said, "On the journey of life, friends are your only consoler." He also said, "Women can only moisten your soul but cannot enrich it; friends give you the greatest assistance in the latter requirement." Indeed, friendship is precious. When you are troubled and disappointed, it can comfort you and encourage you. It can enable people to overcome all difficulties and strive upward.</p>
<p>However, the "friends" that Anatole France speaks of should be true confidants, and the "women" he speaks of are just some vile strumpets.</p>

<h3>The Jade Pool</h3>
<p>— Wang Laoqin</p>
<p>The Jade Pool is where the Queen Mother of the West ascended to immortality. According to the Collection of Immortal Biographies, the pool is also the Garden of Kunlun. However, according to a recent visitor from Gansu, there is also a Jade Pool on a dirt mountain by the side of Jing River Lake in Jingchuan County of that province. The scenery is particularly beautiful with shallow grass and a flat field. One Queen Mother has two Jade Pools. It is difficult to understand who is real and who is fake. Could it be that the Queen Mother's Jade Pool was also like the current residences of important people, with both a main and a secondary location?</p>
<h3>The Ice-Selling Child</h3>
<p>— Minzi</p>
<p>It's hot! The yellow dog is panting, sticking out its tongue, enjoying the breeze under the shade of the tree.</p>
<p>The young masters of wealthy families are drinking fresh water with sugar. The young mistresses are applying rouge under the electric fan, preparing to go to the open-air dance hall of the night garden.</p>
<p>Outside, the ice-selling child is carrying a loquat basket, hoarsely shouting, "Cold and陰哦, selling ice哦, ice哦 ice哦 selling ice哦!"</p>
<p>The sun evaporates the oil on the asphalt road. Yet, they still walk quickly under the sun, not allowing their pace to slow down even a little. If they slow down their pace, the ice in the basket will melt into water. So, although they are only wearing a torn cloth shirt and a pair of torn shoes, they are like being thrown into a fire pit under the scorching sun. They must struggle.</p>
<p>From the main street to the alley, from noon to dusk, they are not allowed to rest for a moment. Although their voices are hoarse from shouting, they are unwilling to taste some of the ice in the basket to moisten their throats. After selling it all, they have to go to the ice-fresh boat to peddle. On that narrow gangplank, people walk with a powerful tremor throughout their bodies. Their heads are dizzy from the sun, and their feet are weak, so they are very worried about the danger of falling. But for those few copper coins, how can they not desperately work!</p>
<p>It is not easy to buy a pile of twenty coins' worth. Because it is裝的浦包, the patrol officer must say that it is unsanitary. So, where there is a trace of the old master, they dare not shout anymore and sneak past, just like a thief.</p>
<p>They endure the terrible sun, endure the patrol officer's baton, they shout until their throats are broken, and they wear out the soles of their feet.</p>
<p>But what are they doing it for? This ice-selling child.</p>

<h3>Basic Theory of Treating Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Physician Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor Medical University</p>
<p>Results of animal experiments—prove that gonorrhea can only be completely and fundamentally cured by increasing the immune bodies in the blood.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea has always been regarded as a difficult disease to treat. Even today, with the flourishing of science, doctors who have not used the latest gonorrhea treatment still feel that gonorrhea is very棘手. Although淋藥 is becoming more and more innovative, the principles of these medicines are all inherited from the old, so their effects are not particularly significant.</p>
<p>However, recently our medical community suddenly discovered a珍异金鑛, creating an unprecedented miracle in the treatment of gonorrhea, which is the introduction of the gonorrhea holy medicine "克淋儂."</p>
<p>The general public does not yet fully understand the theory of "克淋儂." The main points are summarized as follows: In 1890, Dr. Romer invented a preparation made from equine lipid juice, which was injected into animals that had been inoculated with gonorrhea bacteria. When their blood was examined (under a microscope), the gonorrhea bacteria were found to have lost their activity. In 1903, Professor Christmas further formulated a mixture of animal and plant lipids and bile, which was injected into cattle (already inoculated with gonorrhea bacteria). Before injecting this preparation, secretions were taken from the cattle to make a pure culture of gonorrhea bacteria on a test tube slant culture medium, and the bacteria were found to peel off and float on the culture medium surface. After applying this preparation, the gonorrhea bacteria in the culture were completely killed. Later, Biedel. combined animal and plant lipids and bile with pure色素 to create the internal gonorrhea holy medicine "可淋儂." After repeated animal and plant experiments and application to humans, all achieved beautiful effects. poetes used this medicine on patients with acute gonorrhea (90 to 97%). Torrey applied it to male patients with chronic testicular and prostate gonorrhea (80 to 93%). Dr. Herbsl applied it to women with toxic gonorrhea leukorrhea (and used "卡而雪地" externally as a suppository - 90 to 97%). Ballenger applied it to arthritis (72 to 83%). On average, 95% of those who took "克淋儂" were completely and permanently cured.</p>
<h3>Good Development is the Foundation of Longevity</h3>
<p>— Physician Song Zhongyu, Graduate of the Army Medical University</p>
<p>Hormone deficiency is the cause of poor development</p>
<p>Development is the most important issue for health in life. Good development leads to health and longevity, while the opposite inevitably leads to premature death. Considering hormone function, it has the closest relationship with development. If the hormones of the pituitary gland, pineal gland, thyroid gland, thymus gland, adrenal gland, and gonads are旺盛, then the person will have a tall stature, a clear voice, a full spirit, and a magnificent kidney area. Otherwise, the body will be thin, the spirit will be weak, and the genitalia will be short. The reason is due to congenital insufficiency or acquired excessive masturbation, which consumes赫尔蒙. The best treatment is to take the only hormone preparation "补体康," and those who are weakened by excessive masturbation should take "补体康" and "耐而斯遗精片" at the same time.</p>
<p>Patient Jiang Ruochen, when he was young, had a habit of masturbation and often had nocturnal emissions. He was underdeveloped and had small genitalia. He had weak erections, dizziness, and forgetfulness. After marriage, his body was weak and unable to cope. He also suffered from premature ejaculation. The couple were both苦之, and repeated medications were ineffective. He even became impotent, and Jiang Jun was filled with sadness. Fortunately, he was introduced by his close friend Jia Shanda to come to me for treatment. I diagnosed that his hormone function was exhausted, so I prescribed "补体康" to昂进 his function. Because "补体康" is made from the hormones of brave and strong animals, it has the special effect of promoting development and旺盛 performance. Therefore, Jiang Jun felt that his kidney area had returned to spring and his waist and back were strong after taking three bottles of medicine. He continued to take the previous medicine and also took "耐而斯遗精片" to treat nocturnal emissions. After about a month, all the symptoms of weak performance were completely cured. Moreover, his muscles were firm, his complexion was rosy, and his spirit was radiant.</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea Lecture by Physician Yao Juyan</h3>
<p>Clinic: Sichuan Road, Ningbo Road corner Clinic Hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>How to Eradicate Chronic Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Chronic淋时 gonorrhea is a major problem in gonorrhea. Because gonorrhea becomes chronic, it is unpredictable and most difficult to cure. However, it is definitely not an incurable disease; it is actually because the treatment has not been obtained correctly. Generally, there are many reasons for gonorrhea to become chronic, but most are due to initial delays in treatment or treatment that is not correct. The patient is also unaware because the acute phase has passed and the superficial pain has decreased. On the one hand, the gonorrhea bacteria潜入 deep inside and are active in secret. Therefore, the deep lesions become more enlarged, increasing the difficulty of treatment. Occasionally, when encountering external刺戟, it will suddenly break out. If it is not handled urgently, reproductive function is often lost as a result. The terrible流毒 is then transmitted to the wife, causing the wife to have more leukorrhea. These toxic leukorrhea most easily kill sperm, becoming a major problem for offspring.</p>
<p>Even worse, if both sexes are infected with gonorrhea, even if one party is cured, the other party who is not cured will still transmit it. I have encountered many cases of this disease. There is Mr. Xu Baigang, who lives in a certain里 on Dafama Road, who is 26 years old, has been married for four years, and has been suffering from gonorrhea for five years. His wife was also infected after marriage. Later, he was introduced by a friend to me. He complained that he had been treating this disease for many years, and although he had been cured several times, he did not abstain from sex, so he was re-infected. Now he has developed arthritis and cystitis. His wife's leukorrhea is also sometimes mixed with blood, and the cavity刺痛 causes irregular menstruation. I used anti-gonorrhea血清 and electrical therapy, and also gave him "克淋儂" to kill and eliminate the extensive gonorrhea bacteria. After five weeks of treatment, he was completely cured. His wife's toxic gonorrhea leukorrhea was still instructed to take "克淋儂" internally, and she used "卡氏阴道片" in the道中 as a suppository. After four weeks, the inflammation subsided, the pain stopped, and the leukorrhea disappeared. They have lived together until now without recurrence.</p>
<h3>A Hundred Questions on Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Former Professor Deng Yuanhe of Nanyang Medical University</p>
<p>Clinic: Intersection of Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road Consultation Hours: 4 PM to 6 PM</p>
<p>4.  Is treatment and recuperation centered on mental tranquility or physical rest?</p>
<p>5.  What exactly is the purpose of rest therapy?</p>
<p>Modern approaches to treating tuberculosis have made great strides compared to the past. Previously, tuberculosis patients would travel extensively for treatment, even enduring strenuous journeys, without understanding the need for rest. Consequently, the outcomes were often poor.</p>
<p>It is now understood that tuberculosis is caused by tubercle bacilli eroding the lungs. Generally, it is known that to heal tuberculosis, the affected areas must completely heal. To achieve this healing, ample rest and recuperation are essential to minimize respiratory movements in the lungs. Therefore, rest therapy is of primary importance. When I was responsible for academic affairs at Nanyang Medical University, students often discussed tuberculosis issues with me, with a strong emphasis on this aspect. In practice, proper rest therapy involves both mental and physical tranquility. Mental tranquility involves avoiding unnecessary emotions, which is an indirect condition for healing tuberculosis. Physical rest, on the other hand, directly reduces respiratory movement in the lungs, making it more crucial.</p>
<p>However, working individuals often face many obstacles in their treatment, making prolonged bed rest for physical tranquility difficult. In such cases, one can only seek a special effective medication to allow the lungs to rest and promote healing. Such a highly effective drug is Tume's "Pulmo-Tona." This medication is effective for both male and female tuberculosis patients in all stages. For tuberculosis patients also suffering from neurasthenia, headaches, insomnia, palpitations, and memory loss, "Pulmo-Tona" can be combined with hormone supplements. For example, men can use "Corporex," and women can use "Femina-tone." "Corporex" can also treat back pain, impotence, and stunted growth in male tuberculosis patients. For nocturnal emissions, "Anti-Nocturnal Emission Tablets" can be taken concurrently. "Femina-tone" can regulate menstruation and menstrual pain in female tuberculosis patients. For leucorrhea, "Car-Snow-Dee" can be used externally as a suppository. For symptoms such as hemoptysis, coughing, bloody sputum, chest pain, night sweats, and emaciation in tuberculosis, "Pulmo-Tona" must be the primary medication to nourish the lungs and eliminate tuberculosis.</p>
<h3>A Youth Addicted to Masturbation</h3>
<p>— Physician Song Zhongyu</p>
<p>Treating pale complexion, nocturnal emission, and weakness.</p>
<p>Masturbation is most prevalent among adolescents and young adults. Once tried, it can become a bad habit, leading to physical and mental weakness and resulting in persistent and difficult-to-cure nocturnal emission. There are many types of nocturnal emission, including wet dreams, daytime spermatorrhea, and leakage of semen during bowel movements or exertion. The underlying pathology is the damage to the sexual nerves caused by masturbation, leading to relaxation of the vas deferens and subsequent semen leakage. If nocturnal emission is not treated with "Anti-Nocturnal Emission Tablets," the semen will become increasingly depleted, leading to mental weakness, insomnia, palpitations, memory loss, reduced thinking and judgment, impotence, and weak erections.</p>
<p>A patient named Hu Guangwei had been masturbating for many years. As a child, he showed no symptoms, but as he grew older, his body remained small. He was thin, his genitals were underdeveloped, and he experienced nocturnal emission two or three times or even five or six times a week. His memory deteriorated, his academic performance declined, and he became emaciated. His family, being a traditional household, arranged a marriage for him to bring good luck, but the sexual activity only weakened him further, leading to renal atrophy, premature ejaculation, and a host of symptoms. Hearing that his friend Han Shaokang had been cured of kidney deficiency with "Corporex," he bought two bottles and saw significant improvement! He came to me for examination, and I advised him to continue taking "Corporex" while also taking "Anti-Nocturnal Emission Tablets" to treat his nocturnal emission. After taking six bottles of each medication, all his symptoms disappeared. His sperm became strong, his physical strength increased, and he gained considerable weight. Now, after five months, he has developed well, his muscles are strong, and he has become a tall and imposing man.</p>
<h3>Consequences of Menstrual Irregularities and Insomnia</h3>
<p>— Physician Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>Pregnancy cessation leads to multiple illnesses and a haggard complexion.</p>
<p>A woman's menstrual cycle usually occurs every 28 days without any pain, which is considered a physiological menstruation. However, many women, due to a lack of self-care, early marriage with excessive sexual activity, ignorance leading to bad habits, or frequent childbirth causing deficiency of both qi and blood, experience ovarian dysfunction and irregular ovulation, leading to menstrual disorders. This can lead to neurasthenia, insomnia, irritability, depression, and leucorrhea, significantly affecting reproductive ability. Studies have shown that neurasthenia and menstrual irregularities account for over 85% of cases of pregnancy cessation. Pale lips, anemia, and a haggard complexion can break many happy marriages and lead to severe consequences.</p>
<p>The most effective treatment for this condition is internal use of female hormone supplements. This medication is a highly effective agent for correcting ovarian function and harmonizing corpus luteum function. It also promotes the growth of new cells, eliminates all old cells in the body, and enhances the function of the reproductive system, achieving the goal of regulating menstruation and improving fertility. Furthermore, "Femina-tone" promotes metabolism, so after taking it, the skin becomes fair and tender, wrinkles on the forehead are smoothed out, the figure becomes graceful, and the youthful beauty of the original age is restored, allowing one to enjoy the happiness that life should offer. Therefore, in European and American countries, since the introduction of "Femina-tone," the health and reproductive ability of half of the women have become stronger and more capable than before, which proves the greatness of "Femina-tone."</p>
<h3>Recent New Trends in Endocrine Therapy</h3>
<p>— Physician Chen Zongkun of Imperial Medical University of Japan</p>
<p>Careful selection of materials, reasonable manufacturing methods;</p>
<p>Then, make the best use of everything, and every use will be effective.</p>
<p>Recently, endocrine therapy has made significant progress. The manufacturing methods vary, and the effects are different. The quality of these endocrine preparations is very important for their effectiveness, and the selection of raw materials must be carefully distinguished using scientific methods. If the manufacturing method is crude and the raw materials are impure, it may have the name of an endocrine preparation but lack the therapeutic effect of endocrine therapy. For example, even when using the same Lipuide testicnlaire injection, the effects will be significantly different depending on whether it is derived from strong animals or from old or diseased animals. Therefore, the selection must be strict when applying endocrine therapy.</p>
<p>However, the preparations that are currently recognized by medical scientists worldwide as the most satisfactory are the German-developed "Corporex" for men and "Femina-tone" for women. These two drugs are extracted from the hormones of animals in their prime of youth and are refined using scientific methods. After extensive practical trials by professors at European and American universities, Dr. Monk, a professor at Kangmiss University, used "Corporex" to cure a man with stunted development caused by masturbation. His lower body development was only one-third of an adult's, abnormally small, and he suffered from nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation. Dr. Meng first tried ten different hormone preparations without success, and then switched to "Corporex." In less than two months, his development became normal, and the headaches, insomnia, palpitations, memory loss, back pain, and limb weakness caused by nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation were all cured. He became a flawless, handsome man. After Dr. Meng's successful practical trial, "Corporex" was widely used by medical professionals around the world, who recognized "Corporex" as the most authoritative preparation in endocrine therapy.</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea with Nearly Decayed Penis</h3>
<p>— Physician Wu Zhonglin, Graduate of Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Hong Shanzhi, from Anhui Province, has been doing business in Shanghai with his father for many years since he was young. Due to business socializing, he had been involved with prostitutes at an early age and contracted chancroid. Although it was once cured, he did not dare to dream of erotic encounters again. Unexpectedly, the year before last, after getting drunk, he returned to the red-light district. Soon after, he experienced alternating chills and fever. Mr. Hong thought it was chancroid again and took chancroid medication privately, but it was ineffective. Later, he learned that he was suffering from gonorrhea instead. He repeatedly used transdermal sterilization lamps for local internal use, but still, there was no effect. His urination became even more difficult, and gonorrheal filaments and pus cells came out together. The front part of his penis felt particularly swollen and painful. Introduced by a friend, he sought my treatment. I saw that his anterior urethra was swollen and had two eroded holes (as shown in Figure 1). His other prostate glands also felt swollen. In addition to performing massage, I prescribed "Clinon" to reduce inflammation, prevent corrosion, promote diuresis, and relieve pain. After three weeks of taking the medication, the swelling and pain in the local area had subsided by 70-80%. However, the holes were not completely filled, so he still felt slight pain when urinating. After taking it for another two weeks, the swelling and pain completely disappeared. I used a urethral reflector for examination, and the two eroded holes in the front part of the penis were completely healed and restored to normal. This is ironclad proof of the powerful antiseptic and bactericidal power of "Clinon." If Mr. Hong had not sought treatment early, his penis would have rotted, hindering reproduction, or even rendering him completely unable to reproduce.</p>

<h3>Autumn Stomach Problems</h3>
<p>— Physician Wu Zhonglin</p>
<p>As a rule, appetites are always better in autumn than in summer, but because of this, people often overeat. Also, because the weather changes suddenly from hot to cold, it is easy to develop stomach problems. As a proof, there have been many more patients with stomach problems coming to my clinic these past few days. Their symptoms are generally chest tightness, belching, acid reflux, stomach pain, a feeling of fullness after eating even small amounts, bad breath (often unnoticed by the patient), thick tongue coating, bitter taste, loss of appetite, constipation, or, conversely, diarrhea with frequent, noisy flatulence. Such poor digestive function often carries the risk of developing stomach cancer or appendicitis. Do not underestimate it.</p>
<p>In treating these symptoms, in addition to telling them to pay attention to their diet, I prescribe "Strong Stomach Essence" to promote digestive function. This medicine contains high-value yeast and valuable ingredients such as vitamins and calcium, so it has the effect of rapidly digesting and clearing food stagnation in the stomach and intestines. Also, because it promotes digestive function, the effects of "Strong Stomach Essence" are typically seen in about two weeks. In addition, because this medicine contains a large amount of vitamin B, it is also effective for beriberi. At this time of early autumn, when the weather is often cold and warm, and eating habits are irregular, it is easiest to damage gastrointestinal function, so "Strong Stomach Essence" is a must-have medicine.</p>
<p>Reader's Corner</p>
<p>The following medicines have been proven effective through practical trials by physicians from domestic medical universities. When purchasing, please be sure to identify the medicine name and do not mistakenly believe others and purchase miscellaneous cheap inferior medicines, which will worsen the illness and endanger life!</p>
<p>Joint Swelling and Pain</p>
<p>Mr. He Da'e: Your joint swelling and pain is gonorrheal arthritis. It is advisable to take "Clinon" to eliminate the widespread gonorrhea, which will cure your illness. Alternatively, please consult with physician Yao Juyan for anti-gonorrheal serum and electrotherapy. As for your wife's leucorrhea and irregular menstruation, she can take "Clinon" to eliminate gonorrhea, "Femina-tone" to regulate menstruation, and use "Vaginal Tablets" as a suppository to eliminate leucorrhea.</p>
<p>Coughing and Nocturnal Emission</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Qingshan: Coughing, nocturnal emission, night sweats, etc., are signs of tuberculosis. You can take "Pulmo-Tona" and "Anti-Nocturnal Emission Tablets" for symptomatic treatment. If your nerves are already weak, you can take "Corporex."</p>
<p>Insomnia</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Deng: Your condition is neurasthenia. It is advisable to take large amounts of "Corporex." If your appetite is poor, it is advisable to take "Strong Stomach Essence" concurrently for faster results.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Slum Education</h3>
<p>— Jianping</p>
<p>Last month, the forced eviction of shacks aroused the sympathy of the majority of people. Thus, those who have always been discriminated against, even never cared for, living in a hell-like human world, who are called "slum dwellers" and "scum," have gradually gained the attention of the general public. Of course, the so-called "attention" of the upper class, who still have inherent bad habits, is still somewhat comical. However, it is a good thing that their life, which is worse than a dog's, is nakedly exposed in front of everyone. - At the very least, it can let some people who speak idly behind closed doors know that there really is this kind of "scum" in this society: at the same time, it makes it clear that this is not the paradise-like society that they have embellished in their minds, and that there is still a long way to go.</p>
<p>After paying attention, there is, of course, so-called "feedback." These feedbacks are undoubtedly well-intentioned, although they carry the "good" intentions of benevolent philanthropists who are compassionate to the world.</p>
<p>The proposal of slum education is one of these "well-intentioned" feedbacks.</p>
<p>Regarding this, we have also seen a very complete and very precise outline of a plan to implement slum education. (This was published in several major newspapers in the middle of last month). Now, let's introduce a little bit of this "outline of the plan to implement slum education." In the two items of "goals" and "policies," needless to say, there is nothing more that can be added. At the same time, it can be said very simply that the most important and most special part of this plan outline is "to arouse their interest in education through entertainment." Therefore, in the "undertakings" section, we have seen a lot of designs about "entertainment" and focusing on "leisure education." The menu includes "slum entertainment rooms, slum tea gardens, simple sports grounds, concerts, variety shows, slum carnivals, etc." are all very complete. Secondly, this plan outline also pays attention to "health education." In this item, it also opens "mosquito and fly eradication teams, anti-drug slum clinics, health guidance, health exhibitions, etc." It can be said to be perfect.</p>
<p>If this education can be "implemented," then of course it would be the best thing. The "slum" would also become a "paradise," and there would be no more "human suffering." However, unfortunately, the real fact is not so perfect. Now, let us let the facts be a fair witness:</p>
<p>The Erri Evening News and major newspapers on the 3rd reported: The slums in the Hudong area were forced to be demolished again on the morning of the 2nd, resulting in a bloody tragedy. It is estimated that more than 30 slum dwellers were injured, and 8 people, including Sun Hankui, were arrested on the spot and temporarily detained in the Yangshupu Police Station. They can be transferred to the court on the morning of the 3rd.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Shanghai Ciyou (Charity and Education) Orphanage (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>(Special Report by this Newspaper) Yesterday, I made a special trip to Tangshan Road to visit the Shanghai Ciyou (Charity and Education) Orphanage, which is organized by the China Ciyou Association.</p>
<p>I handed in a business card through the iron gate, and a child of about ten years old came to open the door for me. After I told him the purpose of my visit, he went inside to notify someone. Walking inside, a staff member, Ms. Mai, greeted me in the reception room.</p>
<p>The reception room was quite large, and the furnishings inside were simple and elegant. In addition to many forms and photographs hanging on the wall, there was also a glimpse of the grades of the orphanage students. Ms. Mai talked to me for a few words in the reception room, and then she hurried out. But soon, she brought in a copy of "A Brief Overview of the Shanghai Ciyou (Charity and Education) Orphanage," and turned the pages for me one by one, and explained it to me in detail.</p>
<p>The orphanage was founded in 1930. Although it has only been six short years since then, the internal person in charge has changed four times, and the location of the orphanage has been relocated three times. And now, due to the orphanage's funding and local relations, the number of students accepted is limited to 80. Once that number is reached, acceptance is stopped. Currently, the orphanage's annual regular expenses total more than 12,000 yuan, and this expense is allocated entirely by the China Ciyou Association, except for a portion subsidized by the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<p>There are now 33 boys and 47 girls here, totaling 78 people, which is 2 less than the limit. And most of the students are transferred from the Public Security Bureau and the concession police station. Fewer students apply to enter the orphanage themselves; because all those who apply themselves or are sent to the orphanage by others must fill out an application form for admission, find a reliable guarantor, and be investigated by the orphanage to confirm that they are truly orphans before they can be approved.</p>
<p>The reason why there are more girls than boys in the orphanage is said to be because of the recent movement to emancipate slave girls. After some of the slave girls were emancipated, they were sent here because they had no home to return to. Others are sent to other care institutions.</p>
<p>They are committed to educating and nurturing children. Therefore, in addition to providing care, they focus more on education. The Shanghai Ciyou Elementary School, which is affiliated with the orphanage, is an institution dedicated to the education of the students in the orphanage.</p>
<p>The age of admission for each student is from five to eighteen. After admission, all clothing, food, and accommodation are completely provided by the orphanage; but students over the age of ten, in addition to receiving education, must take charge of cleaning and labor services in the orphanage. Girls must care for the younger children, sew, cook, etc., cooperating and working together, so that the siblings, brothers and sisters, are happily like a happy family. However, each student admitted to the orphanage may not request to leave the orphanage without reason. If relatives or family members come to claim them, they may do so. If someone is willing to adopt them as children or choose them as spouses, they only need to fill out an application form and find a reliable guarantor. After the orphanage sends someone to investigate and deems them reliable, they can also be approved. However, the living environment of the student after leaving the orphanage is still supervised by the orphanage at any time.</p>
<p>In terms of education, they pay great attention to grade examinations, self-study tutoring, and extracurricular research. In addition, they also pay close attention to the selection of teaching materials, the research on teaching methods, and the training of Boy Scouts. Especially in the area of moral education, they are very serious about the ten kinds of training: order, hygiene, courtesy, sense of shame, diligence, public welfare, honesty, labor, frugality, and self-government. There is also a very strict investigation of the students' behavior and methods of punishment and reward.</p>
<p>In addition to the usual extracurricular activities, there are several short trips each year where they can have picnics in the suburbs or take walks in the park. Entertainment is also not lacking. For example, they must hold a social gathering, film, drama, or group games every two months. And there are quite a few students who can act. They have a Ciyou Drama Society, and the play "The Night Before Children's Day" performed at the Municipal Government on Children's Day this year received considerable praise.</p>
<h3>Psychological Construction</h3>
<p>— Peng</p>
<p>In the autumn of the northern country, the autumn wind howls a desolate song all day long, carrying yellow sand and rolling the withered yellow leaves on the mulberry trees, echoing in the empty classroom of the Da Huang Primary School. The houses around creak and rattle in the wind. The glass panes of the small windows seem to be crying, and the withered yellow paper pasted on the walls is also telling each other complaints.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the sun did not appear, and the sky was dark. The children sat scattered in the classroom, all listless, with a pair of tired eyes, as if they had not had a good night's sleep. Yellowish fluid oozed thickly from their puffy faces.</p>
<p>The school supervisor from a friendly nation sat majestically in a grand armchair to the left of the lecture table, crossing his legs and leisurely smoking a cigar. He watched the smoke slowly drifting in the air and smiled triumphantly.</p>
<p>Just as the smile on the supervisor's lips had not yet returned from his ears to its original state, the bell for the first class rang in every corner of the Da Huang Primary School. It shook the nerves of the principal and teachers, and also disturbed the children's hearts.</p>
<p>After the bell was silent, following the thin autumn sunlight into the classroom came Wang Deming, the Chinese language teacher, a young man of twenty-five or twenty-six years old.</p>
<p>His heart was palpitating, and his large, sunken eyes contained a glimmer of desolation. His legs were so weak that he stepped onto the podium without courage and still pretended to be very polite and bowed to the supervisor from the friendly nation.</p>
<p>Before the children could open their books, Wang Deming asked in a trembling voice, "Number one, Zhang Xiao... stand up." He glanced at the child who was sitting in the seat in front of him, who was nothing but skin and bones: "I ask you, what nationality are we?"</p>
<p>The child rolled his jaundiced eyes, hesitated for a moment, and awkwardly replied, "We are... we are Manchurian!"</p>
<p>As weak as a mouse that has seen a fire-tongued snake.</p>
<p>The children all held their breath, waiting for the question to befall their own heads, like a camel standing in the vast desert waiting for a thousand-pound burden to fall on its body. The classroom was deathly silent, and the faint sounds of the early morning exercises of the troops from the friendly nation could be heard in the distance, their heavy footsteps striking the clear sound on the bluestone streets.</p>
<p>"Who is number two? Stand up?" Wang Deming could not wait to get through this dull oral exam in one go: For this psychological construction of forgetting the motherland and forgetting the enemy, his heart ached faintly: "I ask you, answer quickly, the faster the better, what nationality are we?"</p>
<p>The second child stood up and answered without thinking, "We are Chinese!" Then, as if he had realized that he had answered the question incorrectly, he quickly defended himself: "No, no, no, sir, we are Manchurians, we are Manchurians!"</p>
<p>The child's face changed color in fright, and he twitched in terror and pain. He quickly hugged his head with both hands, as if a heavy bamboo cane had already struck his head.</p>
<p>Wang Deming stole another glance at the supervisor sitting on the side. His hawk-like eyes revealed a tense, murderous light. He had already stood up from his seat, and Wang Deming's body also began to tremble with the children. All of a sudden, he rushed to the child's face with great difficulty, grabbed the little braid on the child's head, and gave him a slap in the face.</p>
<p>The child covered his face with both hands in pain, his bird-like lips moving in terror, revealed between his hands. A pair of pale, timid eyes were begging him for forgiveness, and his mouth was murmuring, as if he wanted to say a word, but he did not dare to open his mouth, as if he was holding all the pain in his chest.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a non-human, terrifying scream almost burst from Wang Deming's chest. He could see clearly that the one he had slapped in the face was his innocent younger brother, Wang Xiaohu... His body trembled even more violently, his face convulsed, and he fell to the ground in a terrible fit of madness....</p>

<h3>Village Scenery</h3>
<p>— Yun Hai</p>
<p>Chen Village is a good place. It resembles a majestic lion stretching out its two front paws towards the fields, with its back against the mountains and its face towards the sea.</p>
<p>On the seaside, there are quite a few docks, where small barges from the county town frequently dock every day. They bring many good or bad news to the village, or the market prices of all businesses. Connected to the docks is a small market. In the past, business here was very good, and many shops had already been built.</p>
<p>This place once had a moment of pride, which was seven years ago when the wealthy old master Chen Yu brought back a lot of gold, silver, and jewelry from San Francisco. This great prestige shocked the people in the surrounding forty-six villages. As soon as Chen Village and the Chen family name were mentioned, people would feel fear and envy. In the middle of the market and the fields, standing tall and firm like a government office, was the "Chen Mansion." There were watchtowers, several layers of iron gates, and even magnificent semi-Western-style buildings. An old villager who had never been to the provincial capital would be truly amazed, wondering what kind of great monster a god had sent down.</p>
<p>Now, all this glory has slipped away with that precious time. All prosperity has been blown away by the ruthless gunfire. Chen Village was destroyed in several inexplicable wars.</p>
<p>The small barges are no longer as impressive as before, and the black smoke does not cover half the sky as thickly as it used to. People are also lazily sighing. The market still operates as usual, but those who come to the market only sell and do not buy, and ordinary days are even more frighteningly desolate. The most famous Chinese and foreign goods store and postal agency, the old brand of Deji in this small place, has now been forced to "sell off everything" at the door.</p>
<p>The owner, Chen Laotong, is a busybody and peacemaker, and he has some authority here. Although he makes a living by running a store, the poor harvests in recent years have also affected him, forcing him to endure a lot of unpleasantness. Now, he is just dozing off there.</p>
<p>Across the street in a liquor store, that drunkard Chen Daniu has appeared again. He is a returned overseas Chinese who was just sent back. He is a young man with a bad temper. After drinking a few sips of double-distilled liquor, he forgets his nature and yells and shouts here and there all day long. At this moment, he is drunk again, his eyes blurred. He stumbles and wobbles onto the road. He slaps the counter of Deji Grocery Store hard, startling Chen Laotong awake. A long stream of saliva still hangs from his mouth, and he glares angrily at this unreasonable drunkard.</p>
<p>"Laotong, do I have a letter? From Tokyo?"</p>
<p>"Bah!" The old man put on his reading glasses, saw that it was that stinky pig head again, and spat a mouthful of thick phlegm at him. Then, he said with a hint of sarcasm: "Your letter? Does Tokyo still want to invite you back? Good fellow, San Francisco is hiring two lamp-carrying servants, are you going? Too bad you're not a genuine Guangyali product!" (Note)</p>
<p>The words didn't seem to register in the drunkard's mind. He swaggered down the road, staggering. His mouth mumbled the mountain songs of children.</p>
<p>A moment later, the sound of the small barge arriving at the shore startled the people here.</p>
<p>Deji Grocery Store suddenly became lively at this moment. Several villagers gathered around Chen Laotong, wanting him to tell them the news. So, he spoke animatedly, gesticulating, talking about how grain prices were plummeting, what kind of turmoil was happening in the provincial capital, and that the pretty banknotes were useless—ten dollars, a hundred dollars, all had become worthless.</p>
<p>"Is it another damn war?" a young man asked.</p>
<p>"Of course!" Chen Laotong frowned, "What kind of devils are fighting? It's said that they're fighting so badly that we have nowhere to go, so there's turmoil in the provincial capital too. Some say fight, some say don't fight, maybe before people even touch each other, they'll start fighting among themselves. There's no point talking about this year!"</p>
<p>"Is it that bunch of beastly bastards? Your mother's rotten goods, I've had enough of their anger there, they drive people away for no reason. What's the point of talking about reason in this world..."</p>
<p>It was Daniu's rough voice shouting from the crowd. People didn't know when he had joined in.</p>
<p>Villagers are always a bit afraid of trouble. Startled by him like this, they retreated one by one and cleared out. Here, only the two of them remained—Laotong lost his interest and lay back on the bamboo bed, listlessly smoking. This reckless man was still staring wide-eyed, as if angry at something.</p>
<p>Chen Village lay there again, lifelessly and lazily. A few shops emitted wisps of smoke, like sighs.</p>
<p>(Note) These are all insults. "Qidi" means "rabbit." It is popularly believed that the lamp carriers in Guangyali are all qidi.</p>

<p>Clouds and smoke envelop the curtained room. The moon is hazy and the moonlight is dim. The Xiao Xiang Pavilion is shrouded in haze. A few emerald gauze windows are cold and desolate. Thousands of jade bamboos whistle. Several slender crabapple branches are green with grass. A melancholy girl is listless with illness. Two little maids are cold and lonely. Only to see her, wearing a thin silk shirt. Her face is thin and yellow. Her eyes are drowsy and filled with sorrow. Her eyebrows are furrowed with hatred. She quietly sits on the Xiangfei couch. She leans softly against the ivory bed. A dim candle sheds tears. Half a cup of decoction is icy cold. Pitifully, she breathes heavily. Her heart is restless. She coughs repeatedly. Tears fall incessantly. Bloodstains soak through her thin silk dress. Her feelings are anxious and she sighs repeatedly with sorrow. Pitifully, she is far away from her homeland. She lives alone in a foreign land. The road is long, thousands of miles away, and she can't see her old home through the white expanse. Vaguely, she fears that she is near the Yellow Springs. She might as well ask to go to meet impermanence sooner. She is absent-minded and all thoughts are empty. Her shadow is lonely and all things are changing. Only to see, the night is deep and the darkness is terrible. The silence is long and filled with sorrow. Only to hear, the wind is whistling and the rain is pouring down. The bronze pot drips endlessly. The iron horse rings coldly. The wind moves the curtain fishing rod. The raindrops patter against the cold window. The bell rings three times. The watchtower strikes five times. The concubine is, the cold wind is unbearable. The long night and rain break her heart. From now on, the disease has penetrated her bones.</p>

<p>Opening "Guan Xiugu" (Mimi Collection Creation Issue)</p>
<p>Gentle-hearted and chivalrous female hero. Following that, the white-haired father is hidden in the city. It is pitiful that she, wandering in the rivers and lakes is like catkins in the wind. She meets that, Mr. Fan and his father make a year-end friendship. Family rules face without avoidance. Talking and laughing sincerely. Xiugu is, a piece of ice heart produces respect and love. The most unforgettable, the red building dream in the hospital secretly eliminates her soul. Recalling that, the father was poor and sick and had no opinion. Fortunately, Fan Jun's friends were deeply affectionate. It is ridiculous that Xiugu is, seeing Miss Fenghuang actually disturbed her heart. Chanting Buddhist scriptures and knocking on wooden fish. Winding intestines and hundreds of knots are difficult to decompose. All kinds of delays cannot be described. Seeing that she is, throwing herself into the general's mansion righteously, her shocking courage rushes into the sky. Blood dyed knife. Xishan Snow does not resign from labor. On the fork infinitely sad words. Only left, a handful of black hair as a joke. From then on the ends of the earth become strangers. Knowing that, there is no such blessing to disappear in the cause and effect book. Better than the thirteenth sister that day. Actually threw away the childish affection. Dragon people in the sea can not be recruited.</p>

<h3>"China Travel" New Drama "Motherland"</h3>
<p>Invites all circles to try out today</p>
<p>Tang Huaiqiu's "China Traveling Troupe" performed at Carlton last time and received quite a bit of praise, but except for "Thunderstorm", other plays such as "The Lady's Fan" and "Meiluo Xiang" were too weak, and Tang Huaiqiu also admitted that they were "technical samples." This time, after returning from Nanjing, he specially telegraphed Dr. Chen Mian to Shanghai to rehearse a new play, and the first shot "Motherland" has been rehearsed to maturity, inviting all circles to visit this afternoon at 2:30.</p>
<p>"Motherland" is a French work, describing the tragic history of the demise of the "Wulamang" country in Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries. It has been translated into "Han" by Dr. Chen Mian, a professor at the Sino-French University in Beiping. The entire play has five acts and about thirty to forty actors.</p>
<p>The play has the old patriot Earl Li Sha (played by Tang Huaiqiu), who lost the love of his young wife (played by Tang Ruoqing) because he was busy with state affairs, and finally sacrificed himself for the country because of the importance of state affairs. There is a fierce and murderous marshal, but he is also a good father to his daughter. There is an adulteress who betrays her husband because of private feelings, and eventually she is also killed by her lover. There are patriotic young people who regard death as home, old women who can kill ten enemy soldiers, and delicate daughters of the boudoir who are kind-hearted and weak.</p>
<p>The structure of the play is extremely tight, and the stage is also very lively, the background of the great man, the sonorous lines, especially the rest.</p>
<h3>The Drama of Women's Rights</h3>
<p>"Women's Rights" was originally named The Runaway of Love, compiled by Hong Shen, and the script was published in the May and June issues of Literature. The main idea is to encourage life to fight and struggle against darkness and evil forces, and should not compromise with it; to be subdued by it. At the same time, it also shows that resistance and struggle should be rational, organized, and not a momentary emotional impulse, heroism. "Women's Rights" is about a woman's failure to fight and struggle against darkness and evil without reason and goals, which is a bright inspiration for young people who are generally wandering on the wrong path without a goal and failing. Hong Shen admitted that it was a satisfactory creation. Director Zhang Shichuan used greater efforts to handle it, no doubt, this is a piece worth noting. And the lineup of actors is even more substantial, starring Hu Die, Zhao Dan, Gong Jianong, Mei Xi, Wang Xianzhai, Wang Zhengxin, Yan Yuexian, Ye Qiuxin, Shu Xiuwen, Yuan Shaomei, Lu Luming and others co-star.</p>

<h3>Recent News from the Popular Harmonica Hospital</h3>
<p>The "Popular Harmonica Hospital" across from the Minli Women's Middle School on Wenmiao Road in the West Gate was founded by cartoonist Zhang Hongfei. Mr. Zhang used to work in the manufacturing department of a large harmonica factory, and is very familiar with the internal structure and repair methods of the harmonica. Considering that there is a lack of harmonica repair shops in Shanghai, which has caused great inconvenience to harmonica lovers, he specially set up a harmonica repair department on Wenmiao Road with several friends from the West. Mr. Zhang has always been service-oriented, so the pricing is particularly low. It is heard that during the opening period, the list price will be discounted by 20%. If you are blessed with patronage, you are welcome to recognize the popular logo, so that you will not be mistaken.</p>
