<h3 id="c56">議會改革聲中之日政黨（上） <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 南雲</p>
<p>近日轟動東京的事，要算是「議會改革案」和新議事堂落成了。</p>
<p>議事堂建築的計劃，遠在明治十九年時。至大正六年始成立「議院建築調查委員會」。正式動工，是從大正九年纔開始的。經過了這樣的悠長歲月，其建築之宏壯華麗，自在意中，無怪乎日本報紙大肆誇張，謂為「集國民二十年之努力，成功純國產大建築之威容，為耀進日本之象徵」了。</p>
<p>然而，誰能說不是煞風景的事呢？就在新議事堂落成，日皇親臨參觀，舉行盛大莊嚴之竣工典禮時，軍部所提出的「議會改革案」，却正在此時期，閙得滿城風雨，遍地皆秋，這在計劃建築議事堂時，也許是意想不到的吧！</p>
<p>根據新聞的登載，軍部關於「議會改革案」的意見是：</p>
<p>（一）否認政黨內閣制。立法，行政，司法三權分立。禁止在議會佔多數的政黨組織政府。</p>
<p>（二）規定政黨法。政黨之行動範圍，由法律規定之。</p>
<p>（三）議會不能有彈劾政府之權限。</p>
<p>（四）限制職業代表在議會之活勁。</p>
<p>（五）改變貴族院之機能，設置經濟參謀本部。衆議院對「經濟立法」等事，可以參加意見。</p>
<p>（六）排擊普通選舉。選舉權僅限於家長及兵役義務終了者。</p>
<p>但十一月六日，關於，議會改革案」，寺內陸相對閣僚之解釋，則為：</p>
<p>（一）基於國體之本義，發揮帝國憲法之眞髓，走向日本獨特的立憲政治發達之途。</p>
<p>（二）恪遵帝國憲法所定之議會權限，而求其適正應用。</p>
<p>（三）正確暢達民意，令公正之輿論，和國民之智能，能充分反映於國政。</p>
<p>陸相這個聲明，自然是很含糊的。所謂立憲政治發達之途，究是如何獨特呢？所謂求其適正應用，究竟要如何應用纔為適正呢？至於第三項所說，則是已經明明白白的指出來，現時的日本議會，幷不能暢達民意，幷不能採納公正輿論及應用國民之智能了。</p>
<p>這種對議會之公開打擊，在軍部可說是早有成算。遠在「二，二六」事變，限制政黨組閣人數時，卽已透出端倪。目前的問題，只是在議會本身，將如何的鬥爭，如何的應付。</p>
<p>十一月五日，民政黨幹事長永井和政友會幹事長安藤，關於議會改革問題，曾舉行重大之會見，討論「政黨更生問題一和「議會政治問題」。討論結果，認為最近所傳的政黨內閣否認及議會制度之根本改革，似乎是在企圖實現法西斯蒂的獨裁政治。此種主張，不僅違反憲法之精神，而且也不適合日本的國民性。因此，政黨對此問題，應一致抗爭。政民兩黨，今後關於此問題，亦應共同恊議，捨泰從來之不同見解，虛心坦懷，共求政黨之更生。（十一月六日朝日新聞）</p>
<p>兩黨領袖這樣恊議後，有一些人，以為今後日本議會和軍部的直接衝突，將成為不可避免的事。共實，這是不然的。民政，政友，兩黨的後面，都有財閥支持。所謂資格最老的兩大政黨（民政，政友），事實上也不過是兩大財閥的代言機關吧了。軍部與財閥之間，利害有時是衝突的，但根本上的利害（鎭壓國內革命思想，統治並發展國外殖民地，）總是一致。在現在所謂的日本非常時期中，軍部或財關，都不願互相發生衝突，每到了彼此間的對立非常尖銳時，他們就會想出和平的辦法，和平解决。這一次議會問題，又何獨不然。</p>
<p>自「九一八一事變後，因為勇於對偽滿投資緣故，三菱財閥和軍部的關係，顯然的比三井密切。兩大財閥對軍部的態度，形成兩大政黨不同的政見。這從近日的議會改革問題，也可看得出來。</p>
<p>民政黨幹剖的態度，從寺內陸相發表聲明後，卽已表示緩和。該黨櫻內筆頭總務，曾經這樣說：「本問題是憲政有始以來的大問題。對此問題之處理，在事實未判明前，大政黨不能不出於愼重。我們希望軍民眞正融洽，打開國難。萬一發生憲政本義被破壞，議會政治被否認之事，為了國家，亦不能不有重大之覺悟。」這不是把民政黨對此問題之妥恊性，完全表示出來了嗎？反之，代表三井財閥的政友會，態度却較强硬。十一月七日的朝日新聞，這樣載着：</p>
<p>「政友會之態度，比之民政黨，頗為强硬，但仍採取靜觀處理之策。民政黨之最高方針，旣决定自重，則以議會改革問題為中心的政民兩黨之提携工作，事實上將無實現之可能。軍部與政黨之對立，以民政黨首腦部之聲明為轉機，將日趨緩和。」</p>
<p>朝日新聞的這種推測，是很正確的。嚴重的問題，擺在財閥與軍部面前，他們是不會不合作的。</p>
<p>甚麽嚴重的問題呢？卽是：東北義軍的活躍，中國抗日情緒的高漲，朝鮮革命民衆的秘密組織，以及日本內部的左翼運動。十一月九日，日本法相曾發表如下的談話：</p>
<p>「概觀日本最近思想運動之情勢，所謂左翼之思想運動，頗難樂觀。自去夏國際第七回大會，决定新運動方針後，似已波及日本之共產運動。避免非合法運動，採取合法運動方式，因而取締倍感困難。加之匿跡已久之無政府主義運動，數年來又在各地秘密活躍。……</p>

<h3 id="c57">荷比瑞加入黃金協定的意義 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— 幸</p>
<p>本年十月十三日英美法三國締結了一個黃金協定。到十一月二十三日荷比瑞也宣布加入這協定了。據同日海外電訊傳稱。以後六國當局當在技術上採取各項措置。使關於匯兌平準基金的運用辦法得以實現。而各國貨幣政策也得以調整。荷比瑞三國的加入黃金協定。對於世界的經濟和政治會發生怎樣的影響。在目下侵略與和平兩種陣容日益明顯的當兒。是很値得注意的。</p>
<p>我們知道黃金協定的基本用意。是在以合作精神來建立國際貨幣的穩定計劃。而法郎的統制貶値便是這個合作方式的開端。但是英美法三國所以毅然採取這一合作途徑。卻有着兩種原因。第一。經過一九三一年以來的敎訓。英美兩國深知單靠貨幣貶値戰的武器。顯然不够解除國際的矛盾。尤其目下的國際市塲中法郎如果任其自由貶値。必然會引起英美兩大集團經濟極強烈的波動。這由任何一面說。都是不利的。爲了避免貨幣循環貶値的原故。法郎的統制貶値便爲英美所極端歡迎。第二。英美法三國在目下世界經濟中。無論就生產、貿易、投資和金融說。都佔着主要的地位。一九三五年英美法進出口總額共値美金七·二五〇百萬元。而德意日則僅値美金三·三〇四百萬元。相差幾達四十萬萬元之巨。英美法在如此優越經濟甚礎之上。如因貨幣戰而再度引起經濟均勢的破裂。那自然是一種得不償失的勾當。由這兩種原因看來。英美法的結成黃金陣綫。在國際經濟和政治上。顯然都是有着極嚴重的客觀意義的。</p>
<p>荷比瑞三國在歐洲與遠東都有相當重要的經濟關係。現在旣然也加入到黃金陣綫。那其中的意義自然也和英美法大致相同。在這裏。我們看到荷比瑞不但在歐洲不能和侵略集團水乳交融。就是在遠東也容易促成與日本無可調和的經濟衝突。尤其荷蘭在遠東殖民地是如此。</p>
<p>這次荷比瑞的加入黃金陣綫。還包含着一個很重要的根本問題。就是防止歐洲市塲「恐慌資本」外流的問題。誰都知道。要完全根絕「恐慌資本的外流。是一伴不可能的事情。因爲在戰爭恐怖的今日。「恐慌資本」的逃逸是必然存在的。然而現在黃金協定的基本目標。如果要成爲平衡六國間經濟關係的一個手段。卻必然得使這個「黃金湧出」歐洲的現象和緩起來。否則那是於六國都沒有好處的。照最近現象看來。美國在這一點上已顯然起了極重大的支持作用。可見美國還是能站在黃金陣綫上用力來支持歐洲國際和平關係的。</p>

<p>休課期內，一面由各校在校內各別舉行座談會，另一面由各校聯合擴大舉行，前者悉在二十五日舉行，各校情形，異常良好，討論之論題，大悉類似如「綏遠抗戰應有的認識及我們的任務」等等是也，會中並有各校當局及敎師等參加講演，態度沉著執烈，情緖緊張而不浮躁，是為各校共同之處，至於彼等討論結果，據記者向各處調査，亦大槪頗呈一致，簡言之，卽綏戰係中國整個國家民族生死存亡關鍵，（二）中國國民之最終目標，在求全民族之自由平等是以對目前之綏戰，應竭力支持，二十六日各校聯合之擴大座談會，全市分三處舉行，參加者均甚為踴躍，秩序亦屬良好，會中請各校敎授講演，論題則為「綏東抗戰前途」，三處討論結果，意見亦頗為單純一致，卽如吾國果能全國奮起，一致抗戰，則其前途全當可達到民族之澈底解放，</p>
<p>此次休課及座談會舉行，不獨各校師生，步驟一致，卽當局方面亦取默許態度，未見出而干涉，良以在全國輿論支持下，祇需不出常軌，無干涉必要，亦無干涉可能也，至於一二學校當局，曾佈吿申誡學生，聽命政府，統一步驟，萬勿自亂後方，分前敵將士之注意者，不通提防學生行動流於過當，及早防備，其實在目前狀况下，目標甚為單純，大槪决不至有紛歧或過當之行動，某校當局之舉動，實反覺過慮，二，果也日休課期後，各校已一律於二十七日復課矣，此卽事實上之明證，</p>

<p>此次綏戰爆發，北平方面，如以往之靑年學生激於義情，紛紛從軍，企圖實地參加戰爭之事、除前日有東北四省省籍之靑年學生七人前往外其餘尙未另見，蓋現代戰爭係一複雜之事，非僅憑熱情，一蹴可就，如無長久訓練，或反足債事，往年上海「一二八」戰役，卽前車之鑑，對於此點，此間靑年學生，似已完全認識，且所謂作戰，前方後方，必須通力合作，方可言戰，最近傅作義將軍在宴各界代表席上，亦曾諄諄言之，是以此次北平學生工作，大槪求實際者居多，至於目前正在組織中之「戰區服務團」，亦僅係詳察彰綫需要而組織之團體，與以往純粹出於義彼者，逈不相同，故共所計劃工作亦僅有下列數項、（一）一救護工作，（二）娛樂宜傳，慰勞等工作，（三）交通聯絡工作，（四）各種普通技術工作，如無綫電等等，此種「戰區服務團」，自開始籌備以來，各校報名者甚為踴躍，如一切困難問題均能順利解决，則出發之期，當不遠矣，</p>

<h3 id="c126">王寵惠談世界大戰更近　隨時有爆發可能　意如正式認偽滿　國聯應嚴正表示 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>日德日意恊定、相繼訂立後、國際間劃分兩大陣綫、形勢較前更為緊張、申時社記者、三十日晨特往訪中監委王寵惠氏、承其發表談話、</p>
<p>世界大戰　爆發更速</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰、已迫在眉睫、如西班牙戰事、表面上雖為西班牙內亂、實則政府軍與革命軍之背後、均有國際背景、各有他國在背後資助、實際上已不啻為國際戰爭、自日德與日意、相繼訂立恊定後、國際戰爭之陣綫、已愈益明顯、第二次世界大戰之爆發期亦更速、現在世界各國、一致加緊軍事準備、大戰之危險已達頂點、隨時有爆發之可能、一旦發生國際問突發事件、如第一次大戰之事件、則大戰之將發生矣、</p>
<p>國際聯盟　威信難復</p>
<p>國際聯盟、現在已完全無制裁及維持和平之威信、其最大原因、實由世界上輿論力量、已不能敵軍事力量、如意大利侵攻阿比西尼亞事伴、世界各地輿論、泰半同情於阿比西尼亞、歐美一般權威新聞家、均大聲疾呼、攻擊意國、但事實上終難敵軍事力量、國聯雖通過由各會員國經濟制裁、但亦無補於事因意在戰前、早已將軍用品購妥、致毫無結果、此外如國聯之手續太麻繁、亦為失威信之原因、在事件發生後、須經過調査、研究開會等長久手續、於事無補、且無論如何、亦難敵軍事力量、故國聯欲恢復其威信、事實上已難、現國聯已成立改良委員會、從事改良國聯之機構、惟自日德等國退出國聯後、欲恢復威信、已非易事、</p>
<p>意認偽滿　應有表示</p>
<p>德意兩國之與日合作、其目的全在於歐洲方面、而日本則在於亞洲方面、對華固有相當影響、惟對蘇俄影響當更巨、中意感情向佳此次意因本身之利害關係、而與日合作、殊出吾人意料之外、惟意大利現尙未退出國聯、連日電傳意承認偽滿、以與日交換承認意併阿、如意正式表示承認偽滿、則本人（王氏自稱）以為國聯當有嚴正之表示、因國聯迄今尙未承認偽滿、如會員國公然承認之、國聯自應有嚴正之表示</p>
<p>我國應求　自力復興</p>
<p>國際形勢愈益嚴重、中華民族之命運、亦更趨危亟、吾人在此存亡危急途中、除自力復興外、別無他途、因國際間關係、全以本國之利害為出發點、無所謂公理與友誼、如我有强有力之國力、始可與他國合作、求眞正之友誼也云云、</p>
<h3 id="c127">實部國貿局擬　改進國產水果　統制生產繁榮農村 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>年來因世界各國經濟咸感恐慌、故將國內過剩之物、向外傾銷、以我國為尾閭、水菓一物、我國每年產量亦鉅、祗以農民墨守成法、致逐漸衰落、外商乘機逐起、致去年度我國進口水菓、據海關統計、總値達六百五十萬元、蘋果佔五十萬元、以美貨為最多、佔總額十分之六、日本及台灣·澳洲·坎拿大次之、葡萄乾進口亦達五十萬元、橘子進口達一百五十萬元、亦以美國為最多、佔總額十分之七、日本台灣等處决之、約佔五十萬元、尙有暹羅密橘等尙未列入、其餘如美國西瓜、南洋羣島之波羅蜜·香蕉·椰子·荔子等、進口達四百餘萬元、現聞實業部國際貿易局、為减少進口値起見、擬在最短期間、將全國水果予以統計，並派員至各產地加以指導改良、庶能向外發展、藉以繁榮農村經濟、</p>

<p>上海中等學校校長聯合會、業於前日正式成立、昨日該會特發表成立宣言如下、在國際衝突嚴重化與中國民挨復興運動的交流中、敎育界所處的地位、愈顯其重要、所負的責任、也愈顯其重大、我們應時勢之需要、謀敎育事業之根本革新、於是有本會之成立、成立以後、將如何使敎育實踐、有積極的表現、如何使靑年生活的動向、有嚴正而合理的指導、如何使敎育事業、與社會國家、發生密切的連繫、成為有生命有光輝的敎育、自有將來的事實、可以答覆、現在謹將本會所擬努力的四端、揭　以吿國人、</p>
<p>我們需要民族文化（一）自從蔣委員長提倡新生活　動以後、就有人提倡中國本位文化建設運動、共　一之前題、卽所謂「不守舊」「不盲從」、但怎樣纔算是中國本位文化、至今還沒有得着結論、我們以為文化是一國人民為生存需要而努力的總表現、中國目前所應該努力的、固然是民生主義的經濟建設、然而要達到這個目的、必須有兩個先决條件、卽帝國主義的侵略、　是內在的、卽民族精神的喪失、因此、中國所需要的文化的本質、雖然是經濟的、而其出發點、郤是民族主義的、敎育事業、是文化建設的一部份、它在民族文化的總體系上實負了披荊斬棘培本濬源的任務、應該毫無疑義的、站在民族主義基點上、鍜鍊靑年的奮鬥精神、發揮民族的固有能力、對外謀國家的自由平等、對內謀國民經濟的再生與發達、這是我們需要努力的第一點、應該培植國防敎育（二）敎育之良窳視其能否合於現實的需要而定、中國民族復興運動、固然應該從百年大計上着想、但和平與侵略兩陣綫對立的形勢、巳尖銳化和擴大化、世界危機的總爆發、迫於眉睫、中國處於强敵的政治和武力雙重壓迫之下、民族的生命、遠東的和平、都瀕　危殆事實上、已經不是從容建設、談笑退敵的時候了、年來政府對於國防建設、確巳下了很大的决心、且巳有了顯著的成績、不過這個責任、是要政府和人民共同肩負起來的、敎育界職責所在、更不容諉卸了、所以現階段的學校敎育、在社會科學方面應該培植精神國防、在自然科學方面、應該依其性質、盡量從事於國防準備的硏究和製作、在管理訓練方面、尤其應該絕對軍事化、非但要養成吃苦耐勞精細迅速的習慣、並且要時時注意於作戰救護情報宣傳防毒防空的演習、卽使一習題一競賽之微、都須涵有國防的意義、這是我們需要努力的第二點生活敎育打成一片（三）敎育與生活、係互為因果的、卽為生活而不得不受敎育、也只有藉了敎育的推動纔能使社會生活不斷地向上和前進、離開生活、除一部份優秀靑年、能適應社會生活外、其餘非但無創業能力、卽就業亦處處生障碍、於是大批畢業靑年、便陷於失業和飢餓的氛圍中、莫由自拔、這種現象、當然還有經濟的和政治的原因、而敎育實施、與社會生活晚節、却未嘗不是原因之一、比年以來、職業敎育、巳由理論而見諸實行、可是大部份中學、還沒有改弦易職、其在職業敎育的學校中、雖然學科方面、巳與職業漸决接近、但實際上、仍未與職業機關連絡一氣、職業機關、也似乎不重視職業敎育、至於學生的平時生活、則更與社會隔離缺乏社會一般的經驗和認識、這是我們需要努力的第三點、</p>
<p>領導敎界援綏運動（四）綏遠在國防上的重要性是誰都明瞭的、綏遠失則華北數省、均不能保、甚且整個中國、都有淪於殖民地的危險、在敵人方面、要完成其包圍外蒙侵佔華北的旣定政策、對於綏遠、又勢所必奪、政府為保障民族生存和領土完整、已發動民族解放戰爭、數萬忠勇之國軍、巳在風雪漫天的前綫、浴血而戰、且巳發揮其威力、迭摧强敵、進佔匪偽盤據之百靈廟、現在全國民衆、都起而援應、節衣縮食輸欵前方、民氣之發揚、兵力之雄厚、在在均足為民族復興之象微、敎育界居靑年領導地位、允應罄其才力物力、以為之倡、這是我們需要努力的第四點、以上四端、均屬本會今後應有之努力、當仁不讓有志竟成、我們誓本總理大無畏之精神、蔣委員長昭示苦幹之信條向前邁進、惟望敎育當局、各界人士、予以指導督促、俾益增進效能、幸甚</p>

<p>四馬路被稱作上海的文化街，因為那裏是書店的總匯。但在虹口區的一條靶千路上，也大，有文化街的意味。打從北四川路口文華書局起，至北河南路止，就是靶子路的西段，路程並不長，可是沿路和附近有着不下二十多個學校，小學以及外國語專修學校，每校學生多則三四百人，少則也有日來個人，合起來自然不在少數了。</p>
<p>時鐘的長短兩針向上指，那便是中午放學的時候了，馬路上的學子，男的，女的，大的，小的，頓時擁擠起來，遠遠望去，祇是藍色的晃動，足有半個鐘頭。這種熱鬧，我們在別條馬路上，是見不到的，就是江灣的學府之街，也沒有這樣的好看</p>
<p>大槪藍色是旣不鮮明，也不怎樣暗淡，有所謂合乎中庸之道吧。自然我愛學生的天眞活潑，前進，同時也就愛了藍衫。</p>
<p>我常常踱着靶子路，尤其是中午。我在學生羣中，踱過了道一段虹口區的文化街，嘴裏也不禁常常念着：「學散中午候，藍衫滿街頭</p>
<h3 id="c216">盧家灣橋 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 陳天錫</p>
<p>盧家灣橋，是在南市斜徐路的中間，在五六年前，尙能見到木架的橋樑，近年來被當局塡沒，巳無橋的痕跡，致行人都只知有盧家灣，而不知有盧家灣橋了。</p>
<p>在沒有塡沒以前，盧家灣橋下，是一條汚穢不堪的臭泥洪，每當夏天，這浜裏日積月累的廢物，被强烈的日光暴曬，直薰得人頭暈目眩，故行人對此，都視為畏途。</p>
<p>本來該處在十數年前是很荒無的，後來附近空地，大多由地主建築房屋，居民因之日見增加，於是便成為熱鬧的平民區域了。居民旣多，對道無利的廢浜，常然有塡平的必要，所以巿政當局乃命工務局設法塡平。工務局就利用垃圾等廢物，按日依决堆集，現巳塡至盧家灣橋西，料想不久以後，連打浦橋，大木橋，楓林橋等處廢浜，齊將塡平，而築成一條垃圾馬路了。</p>
<p>盧家灣橋一帶，以前的交通，都靠着法商十路和六路電車，因之華商電車公司就有建築路綫直達徐家灣的計劃，以便利權不外溢。但廢浜一時未能塡平，故至今尙未實現。後市公用局主辦的公共汽車，開闢路綫，始奪去一部份的生意。</p>
<p>現在這巳塡平的地方，在政府當局未發表作何用途時，當然又給那些失業貧窮的人們好機會了。起初還是些倒老爺們置放糞車，和那測字先生設攤代人寫信而已。後來近方的貧民見此塡平之地，大可設攤營業。乃向當地士痞地棍接洽，請他們保護，所有一切費用，由貧民每日按攤繳納。自此風一開，果然那些走江湖的人們，聞風而來設攤的，日有數起</p>
<p>從盧家灣橋至斜橋一段，只見人頭簇簇，印入限簾的，盡是些攤基，那種熱鬧的情形，不亞於城隍廟。其中最多的：是舊貨攤，其次是拆字攤，雜要攤，點心攤，膏藥攤，醫雜病攤，鞋子攤，賣武術等等，舉凡走江湖的雜攤，莫不應有盡有。</p>
<p>有一時，這許多攤頭，曾遭市公安局派警取締，後來不知怎樣，沒有幾天，這些攤基仍復發現，諒已有人向當局疏通所致。總之，盧家灣橋，現在雖被人們所遺忘，然而靠塡平盧家灣橋而得到噉飯處所的貧民，倒應該去紀念這盧家灣橋的。</p>
<h3 id="c217">楊樹浦之夜 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 方正</p>
<p>夜神伸出它的巨擘，抓住楊樹浦整個的脈膊；路燈發出慘淡的光輝，電車，汽車，公共汽車，人力車，小車，老虎車。日軍的卡車，熙來攘往着。但是暫時的，這是曇花一現的點綴呵！</p>
<p>這裏雖沒有南京路那樣奢華，也沒有四路那麽神秘，更沒有霞飛路那種異國情調，但這裏却也具着勞勃生路那樣大衆化—勞苦大衆和生活掙扎的人們的大本營—因此到了晚上，尤其是黃昏，這裏所有的工廠，都相繼的放出一批面色憔悴而精神疲倦的男女工人，同時又收進一批骨瘦如柴的做夜工的男女。他們為了生存，不惜整天的勞苦，而取最低的代價。</p>
<p>也許是找刺激吧！不！他們太缺乏智識了，因此侮辱女性的調笑是會隨時出於他們之口的：</p>
<p>「妹妹！開房間去嗎？」</p>
<p>「阿姊！白相去嗎」？</p>
<p>但是被呼「阿妹」者，却會抵抗，也會詛咒調笑者：</p>
<p>「殺千刀」！「猪玀」！</p>
<p>「當心電車軋煞（死）」！</p>
<p>有的却在　廠中乃木溫（工頭）的　惡和××人的欺侮，結果除了嘆息自己命薄外，還有什麽別法可想呢？因為他們要吃飯，只好讓人家宰割，永遠的宰割呵！</p>
<p>這些是日常的功課，是楊樹浦每天晚上唯一的點綴品。</p>
<p>當時鐘的短針，轉到阿爾伯字的10字上，整個的楊樹浦是死了，簡直連呻吟聲都沒有，伴在它的屍旁，只有打瞌睡的巡捕和賣餛飩的朴聲，以及為生存挺而走險的剝猪玀者。（夜深剝人衣服的惡稱）．</p>
<p>楊樹浦之夜，終於在這樣之下消逝了！</p>

<p>— 范學暉</p>
<p>興聖街，如果沒有和它發生關係的人，當然不知道的，不過我相信那些娘兒們，是不會沒有它的印象；因為這兒眞是上海出賣毛絨綫的一條唯一小街，所以這兒最多也是毛絨綫店，此外如顏料店亦頗不少。這狹窄的街道，就它在法租界的商業地位上來說，恐怕也是數一數二了。</p>
<p>在每年的春天時，內地的小商人到上海來辦物，是非到這裏來不可的，如毛絨綫，顏料等商品，恐怕只有這裏出賣，別的地方不易找到。</p>
<p>所以那時候有戴着瓜皮帽，穿了藍長衫，愚蠢而樸實的江北商人。有行為浮滑，說話伶俐的江浙商人。也有輪價豪爽，脾氣古怪的北方商人，到這裏來辦貨。</p>
<p>在朔風怒號，深秋將逝，司冬之神，　着嚴寒而來。那時候的興聖街情景，彷彿又另換了一副面目，眞似鏡花緣裏的女兒國，來來往往，熙熙攘攘都是婦女。這時正是買毛絨綫，製寒衣的時節。有布爾喬式的婦女，有提了小皮篋三五一隊的年輕女學生。有女工，也有所謂藝術演員明星光臨，也有春日早上挑了菜沿街呌賣的浦東式的女子。</p>
<p>伊們擠在每家毛絨綫店鬥口，拿了毛絨錢，綏緩地斟酌那一種顏色適宜自己的。及到春光重臨之夜，這裏也恢復了原來的面目。</p>
<p>我踏進這條小街，已有十餘年，在從前他們是很樸　的，可是如今每一家毛絨綫店，居然也裝起立體式大玻璃窗，陳列着五光十色的引人注目的毛絨綫，這無疑是商業競爭經濟破產的一個象微。</p>
<p>近幾天，這裏整日充滿了呌囂，嘈雜，到得夜神拉攏了灰色薄紗之後，方始漸漸的寂靜；可是朱葆三路的跳舞塲音樂和歌聲，又來佔住我們的耳鼓。</p>

<p>這太好了，是自己熬得苦盡甘來了。他不瞞朋友，肯把這男女定情的東西相送。繼續下去，必定可以達到愛情的最高峯。自己已是忘了熱，把這枚戒指，帶在小拇指上，然後用手去慢慢的撫摸。這也不知道是揣想了多少時候，但是抬頭向窗子外看去，天井裏已沒有了太陽。心裏這時十分高興，覺得這宇宙裏，沒有一樣不是可愛的。天氣不怎樣熱，去看看朋友，快談一回罷。這並不猶豫，穿起長衫，戴了草帽，就走了出去。那枚戒指，帶在小手指上，也不曾取下。走到街上，看見那少年男子，就打量人家一下，不知他定了婚，結了婚沒有？他如果是沒有定婚的話，他想不到定婚那一種樂趣。看到女子，也就想着，不必對他們加以羨慕了，世界上最美麗，最賢慧，最能幹的女子，是屬於我的了。心裏這樣想着臉上是不住的發出微笑。路上的人，也有看見他態度的，也想不出這個少年人有什麼毛病。很斯文的，又很從容的，為什麽走路中笑。他自己是不明白這些的，只管順了脚步走。等到眼前感到闊一點，抬頭看時，面前一列城墻，城墻下，一片菜地。其中兩口長了靑蘆的水塘，有幾稞疏柳，夾了兩個亭子，哦，這是門東的白鷺洲，為什麽到這裏來？再看看天上，半邊天的紅霞，和水塘裏的靑天相映，歸鴉不斷的由天空飛過，那末，到白鷺洲去玩玩也好，晚景是很美麗。一面走着，一面又在想，自己不要太快活了吧？這裏面也許有緣故。夢蘭肯把這樣秘密的事，交給友梅代辦嗎？而且友梅是向來沒提過。再說，今天的態度也可疑。這一轉今之後與致索然，不要遊白鷺洲了，轉身向向頭路上走。來的時候是很從容的，回去可就走到極快了。到了家裏，自然是天色昏黑，棹是有了。在燈光之下，很顯明的，是銅尺壓住了一封信。這封信的下欵，今天　　　，署着MN寄。這已經成了一把鑰匙，解開了國器的煩悶之鎖了？當時也不坐　，　　　　看。（一〇四）</p>

<p>— 焦士潔</p>
<p>橫互在上海的中間，自東至西，這一曲灣灣的水流，　黑的像汚泥一樣，蜿蜒而曲折，長長地，把上海劃分了兩個區域，南岸是租界，北岸稱閘北。由於它，也把上下二等人隔離，住在租界上的，多巨商　，有錢的紳士，闊綽的公子哥兒，摩登的美麗姑娘，這就算是般上等人（？）住的地方。住在閘北的，是一般車夫勞苦的工人小販流浪者，他們住的是茅棚，昤的是大餅甘薯，當然比不上住在租界上大洋房裏吃大菜的上等人了，所以只得稱他們一聲下等（？）人吧！然而在這般下等人的區域裏，現在是被×種人的勢力潛伏着，時時的示戚而施以威脅，一般窮苦人，正有些呌苦連天，這些似乎把階級分得更淸晰些。在這河面上，每天是有無數的船隻來往，小汽輪上鳴嗚的呌聲，黑黑的烟灰，不住的在河面上洋溢着，這就是在上海人人知曉的蘇州河了。</p>
<p>蘇州河因在地位上的關係，而享着大名，但經過了的一二八的滬戰，劃分着戰區與非戰區，形勢更見重要，聲名也因之倍增，現在的蘇州河竟是古時的「護城河」一般了。一二八的滬戰，閘北打成一片焦土，而蘇州河之南，寸土未動，難民逃過了蘇州河，如抵安全之境，生死存亡，僅一河之隔，這時的蘇州河，直可謂為『陰陽河』了。</p>
<p>在蘇州河上，有着十多座橋楔，最現代化的偉大鋼橋，當推外白渡橋和老垃圾橋，每天隆隆的電車汽車，無數輛的經過，仍保持着文風不動，它究有多少壓力是難以估計的。其他的鋼骨水泥橋有裏白渡橋四川路橋天后宮橋新垃圾橋，都靜靜的橫躺在河上，其餘木橋也相當的堅固，都能負担起交通上的責任，勝任愉快！</p>
<p>蘇州河東首的起點，與黃浦江相貫通，左首有着一幢二十層的大厦，右首有一個外灘公園，好比門首的　隻巨獅，把蘇州河點綴得很是壯觀；在四川路口，有上海郵政總管理局，黑巍巍地，大有古老氣色；尤其多的，在新閘橋以東一帶，許多高峨的建築物，都是銀行的堆棧，倉庫，在這　岸，一宇長蛇陣般的排列着糞車，一種異樣的臭氣，隨着空氣的流動，散溢着。</p>
<p>在新閘橋之西，漸漸的轉入貧民窟的區域了，這裏是小小的茅棚，簇擁着一家　的男女，他們大部是江北人，男的靠拉車度日，女的出外做針　，替人家縫補衣服鞋襪，小孩也巳做着拾垃圾的工作，在暑大，儘可看見赤了身子的小孩，什麽小三子小六子的，冬天是在西北風裏抖顫着過活，一年四季不斷的有河裏的汚臭，糞臭，人臭，頻頻的送進他們的呼吸裏。</p>
<p>蘇州河上的風光是如此這般。</p>

<p>— 霞飛</p>
<p>傍晚，在夕陽的籠罩下，我們拖着三條不整齊的影子，一搖一幌地回着徐家匯走去。那是一個離開都市並不遠而帶點鄕鎭風味的所在；在那兒，我們可以看到許多貧民窟的破茅屋，也可以看到別墅式的小洋房，有敎堂，有學府，有年靑的男女學生，有拾枯枝的孩子，有悠閒的紳士，太太，哥兒，小姐；有在地獄下面掙扎的人羣，有背着十字架的傳敎者，有流浪在街頭的失業人，有肥胖的腦袋，有饑餓的面孔：有……之，這都市的另一面，是快樂，疾苦，靜穆，煩囂，的交流綫。</p>
<p>法國梧桐的葉子彷彿飛蝴蝶般的在空中飄着，路邊上躑着兩三個遊人，但臉子似乎都有點憂鬱。敎　的屋頂，像兩枝筆尖似的矗立着，殘陽射着那尖頂上的十字架，發出來金屬的迴光，在空中顫動。</p>
<p>剛在敎堂前兜了一轉，忽然有一種異樣的氣息從晚風中飄了過來，我們連忙掩住了鼻子，逃進了一條狹弄。那一條垂直的狹弄，頭頂的綠蔭遮蔽了天空，夕陽的黃昏從弄口溜進米，返照得成了一種西洋油畫的色調。</p>
<p>走過了土山灣，從一條小橋上過去，便彷彿走入了一個荒村；周圍都是田野，雖然也有幾叢村舍，並且更有流水板橋，犬吠鷄嗚，但却顯得人烟寥落。在聯華影片公司攝影前，正聚集一大堆人在翹首望天，於是我們也好奇地仰首向天空望去，但見在蔚藍色的大幕　，彷彿有一樣小東西在爬得十分迅速，它的尾巴巴好像吐着一種白烟，剎時便構成了四英文字母：C．N．A．C．</p>
<p>「飛機寫字。」我想起了在幾張外國影片中，曾經看到過什麽空中廣吿，就是用小型飛機飛在天空寫烟慕字的。</p>
<p>在聯華攝影塲傍邊，我們順便參觀了亞洲養蜂塲，和鄧炳珊將軍談了許多養蜂經騐。他說：養蜂在我國的確是急需提倡的一種副業，尤其是在菓園附近，因為它不但是有利於花菓，抑且由於蜜源的豐富，蜜的生產量亦優厚。在現代，蜜的用途頗廣，不拘糖果，藥品，　妝品，香烟中都少不了蜜，照目前海關統計，外蜜的輸入少尙年達數百萬　，可是我國對此大好副業尙坐失其利。從亞洲蜂塲出來，本來我們還想去參觀一下聯華攝影塲的，可是時候太晏了，於是便想找着了歸路回去。</p>

<h3 id="c223">上海市其美路平民村　村民家庭衛生狀况散記 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 李彩華</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>「平民村」的名詞，在人們慣聽熟了吧！牠是大上海建設之一，其美路平民村在上海的鄉村一角，但牠的經濟機構，還是脫離不了上海大都市的經濟機構；所以一動一靜，無不息息相關。筆者曾寫下兩文，一是子女死亡統計，六月間發表於本報，一是婦女調査最近發表於中央日報。現在要寫的是村民家庭衛生狀况，因家庭衛生的好吾，與家庭裏面每個分子的健康有極密切的關係。衛生的家庭直接可以促進家庭人口的康樂和家庭組織的健全；間接可以助成國家基礎的穩固和醫治社會一部分的病態，我們要改進他們的家庭生活，家庭衛生也就不得不注意。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>我們這個村裏，一共有二百五十家人家，以住戶住居時間久暫來分，有新近遷來的，有自本年二月遷來的！我們在十個月裏面，一面調査他們未遷入本村以前的家庭衛生狀况，一面留心他們現在的家庭衛生狀况，同時一面實施衛生敎育；現在把牠歸結起來分兩部分來說：一是村外的家庭衛生狀况（指未遷入本村以前而言）一是村內的家庭衛生狀况（指已遷入本村包括新住戶和舊住戶而言）</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>（一）村外的家庭衛生狀况</p>
<p>根據本村住戶談話錄的報吿和調査的結果如下：</p>
<p>（一）住前樓的占百分之七，後樓的占百分之十三，灶披間的占百分之四十一，亭子間的占百分之三十三，後客堂的占百分之六。（二）住租界的（公共租界）占百分之六十七，市區的（閘北）占有百分之三十三。（三）房金四元至六元的占百分之八十强，七元至十二元的占百分之二十弱。（四）不摺被疊床。（五）室內傢具什物零亂。（六）涕痰隨地可見。（七）室小人多空氣窒碍，很少陽光。（八）廚房，臥室，廁所連在一起。（九）門窗常閉。（十）桌椅滿是塵埃，果殼紙屑隨地亂拋。（十）（一）闔家大小唾眠一室。</p>
<p>看了上面的報吿，可以得到以下的結論：</p>
<p>第四·五·六·九·十·五項是習慣問題；其餘都是經濟問題。</p>
<p>（二）村內的家庭衛生狀况</p>
<p>我們再根據上面兩個結論，來分析村內的家庭衛生狀况。</p>
<p>先說經濟問題——可說已無問題，本村甲乙兩種住宅的外觀與內觀，是全村一律的，臥室，客堂，廚房，儲藏室，廁所等，都分間得淸淸楚楚：住屋的方向，一律朝南，自然有充分的陽光，這裏有廣大的運動塲，有寬闊的馬路，有各種新式的衛生設備，所以由經濟而引起的問題，已不成問題了。</p>
<p>至於習慣問題——的確入伍的村民，仍帶有不衛生的習慣，我們常看到他們初遷來的時候，地上不是果殼，就是紙屑和痰涕，傢具什物的安置，也不適當；臥床上常是被頭衣服凌亂的堆在一起；門窗老是關得緊緊的；桌椅上仍有塵埃的陳迹。總之，和村外的不衛生狀况，不相上下。可是經過兩三個月的光景，就不同了，這不是沒有原因的；</p>
<p>（一）有集團的生活——家與家之間，非常聯絡，感情亦日漸密切，不比住在村外的時侯，同一住宅的房客與房客很少往來。這裏是張家到李家，李家到王家，新戶去舊戶，舊戶去新戶，來來去去，往還甚密。無形中倒發生了同化作用和競爭心理；所以不衛生習慣，無形中也减去不少。這是第一個原因。</p>
<p>（二）衛生敎育的灌輸——我們常舉行衛生敎育演講，充分灌輸普通衛生常識；還不時粘貼通俗衛生標語圖畫及傳單的散發，因之又增加他們改進家庭衛生的深刻意義。這是第二個原因。</p>
<p>（三）淸潔檢査——我們常到他們家裏去談天，暗自檢査淸潔遇有不衛生時，隨以剴切勸喩，所以多一次到他們家裏，就是促成他們多一次改進的機會，機會愈多，改進的成效，也愈顯著。這是第三個原因。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>至於舊住戶方面，家庭衛生狀况，日有改進；同時大部分已改變了過去不衛生的習慣，新住戶這一點沒有做到。今後我們要把勸喩宣傳等的重大責任，由舊住戶去担負。我們以這部分時間和精力來研究如何改進村民家庭生活方法上面去。</p>
<p>同時我附帶吿訴讀者：他們住在村外的時候，常時疾病。我想這是與家庭衛生的好否，絕對有關係的，而且是成正比例的：明白的說，就是不衛生的家庭，疾病的人一定很多，衛生的家庭，疾病的人一定很少。如果我們把全國的家庭各分子疾病時所受到物質損失來調査一下，那末，這個統計數學一定是很驚人的。</p>
<p>我們不敢自滿，因爲人力財力的限制，離我們的理想還太遠。在這裏，眞摯地虔誠地希望關心社會問題的人，時時賜敎指正是幸。</p>
<h3 id="c224">中國明日之護士職業建設問題（中） <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 李令棟</p>
<p>所以我們欲革新護士敎育，提高護士職業，不能不從事護士學制去建設起來，高級護士職業學校畢業後，還可有深造的機會，研究本身事業的學府設立，使護士職業爲一種專科學術機關，所以成立護士學院或大學附設護士科，各種學術成立專系去研究，如護士行政系，護士技術系，護士敎育系，護士飲食系，公共衛生護士系，精神病護士系等系。……</p>
<p>如此，護士職業，用不着我們高喊狂呌，護士是神聖的，偉大的，幹着護士職業的同志們，也不會輕視自己，畸形的想做醫生了，社會對於護士職業的認識，再也不會有「高等茶役」「看護」「看護婦」「醫院最經濟的勞工」的錯誤意識的發生，護士職業是一種專科技術而富有高深學識的維護人類健康保障者的一種職業。這種亟待建設而奠立基礎的護士學制，在革新護士敎育初聲中，尙期盼早日速謀成功，樹立一個護士最高學府起來，使護士職業在社會地位上提高。</p>
<p>第三，護士督學設立，爲健全組織之要素。</p>
<p>護士敎育正在策動之時，護士敎育最高行政機關。對於發展護士事業的計劃，及一切的設施，不遺餘力從事去建築，去改造，完成理想的中國護士事業。</p>
<p>但是，這種偉大的中國護士事業建設工程，如僅憑着高級機關，如何計劃完善，如何設計施行，然而負有整個實際工作完成護士新敎育的使命的單位——護士學校。如果不遵守規的去工作，眞實去施行護士新敎育，仍是不能有濟於大體的，我們爲何單說護士學校的靈要，而不說社會的護士職業問題或是醫院的護士職業問題。因爲護士學校爲訓練護士人才的塲所，護士事業基本的策源地。假若在細胞組織就有了缺限的護士學生，卽至長成了個體成功一個護士，也是一個身心不健全的護士，貽害於人羣，所以建設護士事業，護士學校建設是佔着極重要的，那末，監督護士學校是否確實工作沒有？我們也可無疑義的回答，是一件更重要的事。</p>
<p>所以，護士督學制度之設置，就是監督護士學校是否澈底眞誠工作，一劑對症下藥的處方。因爲往往高級主管機關，對於事業計劃，都是嚴密週全的，但是下級部屬每多陽奉陰違，不能按照頒佈規程去實施工作，朦混的也有，舞弊的也有，所有的工作，都成爲書面的文章，文字的報吿，高級機關又不能得知情形，無從査考，工作效率與事業進步，是會永遠達不到發展之日，故護士督學設立之功用，卽應需要而產生，可以聯繫上下兩方，溝通起來，增高行政的效率，督學制度之重要，猶此可見一斑，誠是値得我們研究之問題。</p>
<p>第四，護士課程改革，爲建築工程之圖案。</p>
<p>關於課程改革問題，第一步先就要討論護士學校護生病房實習問題。護生病房實習比任何職業學校實習史覺重要，因爲護士職業的對象，是在謀病人之幸福，解除病人之痛苦，偶然疏忽於微細，這病人生命受莫大之犧牲，故所學習之技術，整個要實地走入病房，去體騐，去練習，去觀察，怎樣從事護理之工作與手績。</p>
<p>然而現在護生實習之情形又怎樣，大都是一面讀書，一面走到病房去工作，在最初年級實習時間每日三四小時，以後逐漸增加，年級越高實時間越多，甚或至每天十小時以上，這種制度我們始終是反對的，含有極大的流弊與危險性的。</p>
<p>因爲在病房實地工作時，所碰到的工作，在課程裏還未能受過此種技術智識的傳授，這種技術的効用，方法，與弊害，一概不得而知，我們就呌護生施行此種技術去服務病人，我們想，這樣盲從工作去幹，病人是得不到技術價値上的益處，護生又不能得到學習工作的目的。</p>
<p>又因上課時間的支配，到病房裏，或來或去，對於病室工作的情形，病人症候的經過，是不能澈底地明瞭，再去考察病案之硏究，也不能顯出護士服務的精神，忠誠其工作，因此，在時間上是不經濟，在護生學習效率上，總總皆無進步的可能。</p>

<h3 id="c225">參加江蘇省會棚戶　佈種牛痘後（續） <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 殷白水</p>
<p>（四）迷信太深，以爲頭上掛着紅布條兒，上面寫着「天花已過」在木偶面前祈禱幾句，就能免除天花，再也不願種痘。</p>
<p>（五）以爲種痘是可發胎毒的，因此兒童總要到三四歲，才種痘，還說在二歲以下的兒童，胎毒沒有能外發。</p>
<p>（六）以爲慈善性質，沒有貴重的痘苗，往往不接受。在生活少裕的家庭，又以爲不要錢的事，於心不安，豈不知這種醫藥費，每人都已出過，每人都有享受免費種痘的利益。</p>
<p>（七）在他們不願接受種痘的光景下，儘管你講了很久，他仍是低着頭，在做着他們的工作，或者回答：「是…是…」敷衍了事，也許連你說的什麽話，也沒有聽見，若你繼續再講說的話，也許會討個沒趣。</p>
<p>（八）在這農村破產，失業增多的怒潮中，一般下層階級的，委實太貧窮，不工作便不能維生，要想求得溫飽，並非容易的事，再加上頑固的思想，以爲種痘後必須要吃發物，要忌口，那裏來得錢買發物吃呢？因此推故不願受種。</p>
<p>（九）在麕集着許多兒童的私塾裏，當你接洽種痘的時候，不待你話說完，那些私塾先生總是不用思索的這樣說：「……你們眞辛苦，在這很冷的天氣，還出來代人家種痘，眞是一片好意，不過我們這裏學子，都已種過了，謝謝你們的美意……」他們說的是眞的嗎？你若再追問他，也許說「然而我們這裏此不得學校，學生自已要種也不能，因爲他們的家長，把兒童交給我管，我便負着很大的責任，你們若說一定要替這些兒童種痘，也不妨，待我今晚通知他們家長，請願種的，再來通知你們，再來麻煩你們吧！」試問他們眞到各家長面前去勸導種痘嗎？以後還來通知嗎？根本許多未受過訓練的私塾先生，他們只知道敎兒童些死的知識，對於兒童的健康，置諸九霄雲外。</p>
<p>研究的心得</p>
<p>（一）在種痘前說明種牛痘，不必忌口，亦不必吃發物，這樣可以說破因困窮吃不起發物而不願種痘的心理。</p>
<p>（二）在巡迴種痘的時候，宜行壓刺法（用針壓刺表皮，使痘苗入內。）因爲這樣用具易於消毒，而且經濟。在取苗到皮膚上，用口吹不合衛生，可用的五分長橡皮管，錐一小孔，將痘苗兩頭截斷，一頭挿入橡皮管小孔中，用姆食兩指緊合橡皮管兩端，加力擠之，則管中空氣壓痘苗由他頭出。</p>
<p>（三）人皆有怕痛的心理，所以在羣衆聚集種痘的時侯，最宜注意。若第一個人說種痘很痛，再也沒有第二三人請願受種，所以第一個受種的人，要選擇較有知識而且雄壯的人，在注射前利用人的好勝性，先鼓勵他的勇氣，例如說：「你很勇敢，其實種痘一點也不痛，比蚊刺還來得輕些呢！如若再說痛，那人太儒怯了。」經過這樣的暗示和鼓勵，就是痛得難受，好歹他自己受過，所以會裝腔作勢的說着不痛，並還會自動的勸導他人，何况實質種痘又沒有像打針那樣痛苦呢？</p>
<p>（四）受種人數，男子占三分之二以上，其中女子初種的，超過複種人數，男子則反是。（指棚戶而言）</p>
<p>（五）受種人的年齡，十歲以下多於十歲以上的，女子十歲以上與十歲以下成一與十之比，男子十歲以上與十歲以下成四與六之比。（指棚戶而言）</p>
<p>（六）因天氣寒冷，不願受種，而有意於明年春天種痘的，若能詳細說明利害關係，則大抵可受勸導而施種。</p>
<p>（七）因不信種痘，而一味迷信的人們，雖經很多時間，詳細說明，收效仍很少，而且當你走後，還要嚕囌詛咒你一會。</p>
<p>尾語</p>
<p>江蘇省會現在已開始佈種牛痘了，不僅在街市，而且已推廣到下層的棚戶區域，這種精神是値得欽佩的，望其他各地，也早日開始起來，以期消滅天花的蹤跡，這樣還未達到我們約期望，再看！沒有衛生設施的鄕村裏，各稱傳染病的發生，都比都巿來得多，死亡率很高，誠爲我國的危險，所以更深望衛生當局，把佈種牛痘的工作，深入到知識淺陋的，迷信很深的，思想玩固的，無衛生設施的鄉村去，使每個農民都受到它的利益，都得到它的保障，那是我國農民之幸，也是我早夕而渴望着和祈禱着的了。（完）</p>

<p>本會今後三年計劃頗不易言，蓋三年間或因種種情形所限制，而難有確切明白之决定，惟我人已知已往三年爲宣傳工作時期，卽亦敎育工作時期，己使社會對防癆問題有相當認識與防治此項宣傳，實屬非常重要，惟工作如僅宣傳而無實際，旣不能使社會提起興味，復不能博取羣衆之信賴，諸如設一店鋪徒登廣吿而無貨品，一俟市民往購，即無以應付，此失敗必意料中事。故本會今後三年工作計劃，應以切實的工作來證明本會存在的必要與眞義。</p>
<p>至實行方法須視何方面最有成績，而合人民所需要，以使大衆有利爲依歸。</p>
<p>兒童健康營之設置</p>
<p>吾人深知肺病爲最易傳染之病，世界上肺癆之傳染，實較任何病爲迅速，較諸麻瘋霍亂等病。爲害尤烈，據近世醫學界調査，肺病自靑年之時幼童之時，不論在人牛羊之乳中，及其他飲食或空氣中，均極易傳染，故小孩最易染癆病，據統計自嬰孩至十二歲，有百分之八十或九十有肺癆病根，惟有時每因體力較强，不致擴大，但偶一失調或保衛不得法，卽可大肆猖獗，是須於防止傳染上予以注意，故兒童健康營之設置，時間經濟均較節省，而兒童獲益較多，此今後計劃一也。</p>
<p>診療所之添設</p>
<p>其次卽爲逐漸創辦診所，本會現已設置二處診所，以經騐而論，多辦比較省費，如舉辦一所需費三千，則辦二所四千已足，如每年以二所預計，則三年間可增六所？此種診所務須謀其普遍，卽公共租界及法租界上應設法設立，至設立診所主要目的（一）使患病輕者來所檢査，此種工作實較醫院治療允著，蓋肺病至二三期治療已極困難，第一期治之極易，防患未然，收效大於治療，多設診所使市民了解癆病檢査重要及使利便；（二）一般靑年無病者就近來所舉行體格檢査，使知道是否健全或有傳染，三年間應盡力促成此項門診處之發展。</p>
<p>癆病療養院之舉辦</p>
<p>其三，卽爲癆病療養院之舉辦，査全滬所有肺病床位，僅三百五十床，若以人口及肺病流行狀况作比，則三千五百亦感不足，故亟需有此項療養院之設置，現江灣已辦了一個五十床位之醫院，但註冊者已有二百人以上，故卽富有者患了肺病欲求一療養之地，猶感不易！惟舉辦療養院經費較鉅，當視經濟能力而實施。</p>
<p>健康運動之提倡</p>
<p>其四，則爲健康運動之提倡，吾人憶及戰後之歐洲，法人過處勞倦之結果肺病患者大增。故吾人今後防癆三年間提倡健康運動使增强抵抗力，亦屬首要。</p>
<p>現在中國已非十年前之中國。本會的將來，是要以工作來證明我們機關之是否能存在；决非徒靠宣傳所以蕆事。吾人對捐欵之收入，允須以事實供獻，政府人民更須聯合一致，共同工作吾人同時更應求靑年會員，從事實際工作爲最重要，經濟問題尤屬次要云云。（完）</p>

<p>電局係爲公衆服務之機關，在電局辦事者，無論其爲職員或差役，概可目爲公僕。公僕對於職務上唯一應守之信條，厥爲忠實；有忠實之公僕，且共忠實之行爲，有充分之證明，自可在取得公衆之信賴。</p>
<p>我國人非有要事不發電報，幾成社會之慣例，則每次發寄一電，旣屬特別重要，其希望迅速到達目的地可知，其希望送妥於收報人不可知。報在傳遞中，而發報人股股致念乎此報者，恐不在少。爲公衆服務之電局，是否忠實？或者亦時懷疑。</p>
<p>欲解决此種懷疑，且可提早使發寄電報的主人，知報已確實地到達收報人之手中，惟有將原電送抵日時，通知原主，或者將收報人收據寄回，此種辦法，卽自本日起實行，名爲「電報送妥通知」。</p>
<p>送妥通知，亦可稱爲電報送妥證，經此一證，具有兩種重大的意義：第一，電局傳送電報，是否忠實送妥？觀乎此證，眞象大明。第二，電報傳遞迅速之稈度如何？能副發報人所期望吾？得此送妥證，卽可據以考査。</p>
<p>其實電報之傳遞，除特別情形外，（所謂特別情形，或者軍事時期，報務擁擠，或者錢路障礙，遠道繞發等。）平時均取捷徑，隨到隨發，絕鮮稽延，不過實際上如此，而發報人常難免多所，顧慮者，以其無絕速之證明也。自今以後，疑慮旣得釋然，焦急自可不必，祗須於電文之前，加以「回據」宇樣，不久卽能收到送妥之證，以慰厥懷，電局爲公衆服務，此種辦法之採行，不獨爲發報人着想，且對於電局執行職務，亦得一忠實之證明。</p>
<h3 id="c230">讀「電政交通與交通建設」 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>昨閱十一月六日江西民國日報社會服務欄林滌非君之「電政交通與交通建設一文，以最近廣昌電報支局，呈控公路處開放尙豐南城廣昌髯都間之營業電話，及廣昌縣政府電話總機，與地方機關接錢通話，妨害其電話營業之收益，請電政管理局轉呈省政府嚴行制止一案，有所論列。林君以客觀態度，爲電政當局進一言，電信事業得社會人士之注意，可謂整理前途之好消也。</p>
<p>林君此文大意，可歸納下列數點：（一）電話交通，爲電政營業之專利，無明文規定，且亦國家政治及人類經濟行爲所不許。（二）電局爲國家交通機關，不應以營利爲目的。（三）廣昌電局附設電話營業之收費過巨，且時間甚不經濟。（四）廣昌電局不應貪功妄報，以阻礙交通建設事業之發展。所述各點，似有相當理由，且恐不僅林君一人意見如此。然在國營電信事業立塲言之，實有討論之價値。作者未知此案始末，亦未知江西電政當局如何辦理，謹以第三者態度，根據法理，敬爲林君及社會人士陳之：</p>
<p>（一）依國民政府十八年八月五日公布電信條例之規定，其第二條，「凡國家經營之電信，由國民玫府行政院交通部管理之；惟海陸軍及航空機關爲軍用起見，自行設置者，不在此例」。第三條左列電信，經國民政府行政院交通部或其委託機關之核准，得由地方政府公私團體或個人設置：……（一）供鐵路鑛山或其他特別營業之專用者：（二）供船舶及航空機航行時迪信之用者；（三）因圖收發之便利與當地電信機關接綫通電者：（四）專供在一宅地範圍內通訊之用者；（五）專供廣播有益於公衆之新聞講演氣象音樂歌曲之用者；（六）供學術試騐上之用者；（七）在未有電話聯絡之一定區域內設置電話者。」又按二十年二月國民政府修正公布之交通部組織法，十八年十月第三屆中央執行委員會第二次全體會議規定行政事項之統屬案，行政院十八年一月十日第三八五號訓令轉奉國民政府令核准電話事業統歸交通部辦理案，以及國民黨政綱對內政策第十九條之規定，關於電話事業，應歸交通部主管，早經黨政最高機關明文規定。所謂「國家政治及人類經濟行爲所不許一之說，似無所根據也。</p>
<p>（二）國營電話事業，不應以營利爲目的，自爲有識者之言，且爲交通部目今力行之政策。惟我國電政，數十年來，全在「以電養電」上設法維持，並未得國庫任何補助。苟不注意營業收入情形，不獨擴展計劃，無法實行，卽目前現狀，亦無法維繫。故在法令範圍內，凡有損及電信營業者，電局自有依法控訴之權。廣昌局所控各節，在電政本身言之，實爲應盡之任務，否則不免有溺職過失之行爲矣。</p>
<p>（三）長途電話價目，世界通例，均按通話時間及距離計算，通話愈久，距離愈遠，則話費愈貴。査部辦長途電話通話價目，以三分鐘爲一决並以兩地之空間距離爲標準其用意卽爲减輕人民負擔，各地價目經交通部核准後，始得開放營業。此項價目，本極低廉，僅及英國三分之一，美國三分之一。廣昌至寗都綫路長度爲七十公里，空間距離爲五十公里，每次通話收費國幣三角，並不過鉅。至三分鐘制，爲部辦長途銅錢電話一致所採用，且爲國際間通行之制度，我國各地使用長途電話之公衆，未聞有所不便。良以長途電話之通話人，必有緊要事件接洽，說話時，均須單簡扼要，閑言套誥，應當除去，如此則三分鐘通話時間，自然够用，若有複雜事件，須仔細商量者，自可繼續三分鐘，殊無以少數通話，須時間較長之故，而將三分鐘制改爲五分鐘制，致將價目標準提高，增加一般通話人之負擔，其理固至顯明者也。惟電局如處理長途電話手續太遲，或業務上不滿人意之處，社會人士，自可要求改進，而電話當局無任歡迎。</p>
<p>（四）電信交通爲一國之神經系統，依據法令，應歸交通部主管或監督，旣如上述，無如，各省建設機關，侈言地方建設，在各省已有部辦長途電話之地方，亦另行設立長途電話，不獨機件綫條，不合技術標準，且無整個計劃，致有重複建設或零星建設虛耗公帑之虞。至减低通話價目，與交部附屬機關，爭一時之利，尤爲法令所不許。交通部爲與各省政府共同發展電話事業起見，爰經擬定「交通部委託省政府代辦長途電話原則一，二十二年七月七日奉行政院指令核准，江西建設當局，果爲發展電話交通事業計，應與江西電政管理局商定委託代辦法，以符法令。准上以言，廣昌縣政府與地方機關接綫通話，確有妨害國營電話營業之收益。公路處開放南豐南城廣昌寗都間之營業電話，事同一律，於法皆無所據，廣昌電局據實呈報，請予制止，實爲合理也。</p>
<p>總之，電信交通，爲目前最需要之建設事業，地方機關，能努力及此，實可欽佩…惟照遵照中央法令，通　　制，循序漸進，則財力，人力，與時間三者，始不致於浪費，而可收指臂之效。否則衝突糾紛，了無止境，豈倡　建設者所應出此乎？</p>

<p>— 葆眞</p>
<p>新訂國內長途電話營業通則內規定之長途電話通話種類分爲呌號通語，呌人通話，傳呼通話三種及尋常，加急二類。爲增進民衆通話之便利起見，此外並另行訂定特種通話三種如次：</p>
<p>（一）特約通話，發話用　欲　日在指定之兩電話機間於預的之一定時刻，作一定時間之通話者，得與電局商訂特的通話合同，以資信守。此項特的通話之合同有效期間，至少須滿一個月，通話費並須預先繳納。發話用戶與電局訂定特的通話後，每日於一定時間內可與對方通話，可省按决聲請掛號之煩。特的通話對於各商行或交易所欲於每日一定時問內與外埠素有往來之商行通話報吿行情者，尤爲便利。蓋各種長途電話，均以掛號先後爲次序，按照普通手續掛號之長途電話，何時可與對方通話，殊難預定。故發話用戶如欲每日於一定時間內與外埠有關商行通話者，自以採用上項特的通話較爲便利也。</p>
<p>（二）定時通話長途電話，經發話人於掛號時，在規定營業時間以內，預定通話時刻者，稱爲定時通話。發話人如欲使用上項定時通話，至少須於預定通話時刻前若干小時，預先向電局掛號，其時間由開放該項特別業務之電局規定公布之。上項定時通話之優點，爲通話時間旣已預定，發話人向電局繳費掛號後，祗須於預定通話時間將屆時前往通話，如有其他要事待理，卽可他往，不至因欲使用長途電話而耗費守候時間也。</p>
<p>（三）夜間通話長途電話，於夜間規定之某時至某時內通話，其通話價目，較日間通話價目低廉者，稱爲夜間通話交通部前以長途電話通話改爲每次按三分鐘計算。且日間通話因話綫繁忙，電局對於發話人聲請連續通話者，照章祗以三次爲限。一般發話人需要與對方作較長時間之談話者，深感不便，例如駐京新聞記者如將本人每日採訪所得新聞用長途電話報吿上海報館，往往需長時間之通話，方可藏事。爰爲適應社會人士之需要及疏通話務起見，頒布長途電話夜間减價辦法規定凡發話用戶於每日下午八時至翌日上午六時內通話者，概按特定價目收費，較之日間通話價目，約可低廉百分之三十。例如甲地至乙地之日間尋常通話，每次收費一元者，夜間尋常通話祗收七角。又夜間通話亦可適用加急辦法，按夜間尋常通話價目加倍收費。並指定上海，南京，杭州，鎭江，武惟，無錫，吳縣等七處先行試辦，自二十四年十二月一日起實行，新通則實行後，此項辦法，仍繼續施行，將來並謀逐漸推行其他各處。</p>
<p>發話人使用上述特的通話及定時通話，如屆預定通話時間，適遇長途話綫已被佔用者，照章應俟該項業已接通之電話對講完畢後，始能由話局接綫通話。惟發話人遇有上項情形，卽使須稍待，爲時亦僅數分鐘，不至戚覺如何煩悶也。</p>
<p>以上三種特種通話之開放地點及詳細實施辦法，係由各地電局按照社會需要情形呈請交通部核准後公吿實行。故一時尙未能普遍推行於全國各地。將來各地長途電話業務逐漸發達電局如査有開放上項通話之需要時，自可隨時呈請交通部核准，以便公衆。</p>
<h3 id="c233">無綫電話通話時應注意各點 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>（一）談話時，請勿搖動聽話筒</p>
<p>（二）對方說話時，宜靜聽，待對方說完一段，再答話，請勿爭先，以免雙方聲浪，俱不能接收。</p>
<p>（三）談話聲浪請勿過低或過高，必須高低平均，庶使聲浪更形淸晰。</p>

<h3 id="c234">評「大丈夫」 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 毅君</p>
<p>范文瀾著　開明書店刊　四角</p>
<p>正在「國防文學」的呼聲喊得挺高的時候，這冊「大丈夫」的出版可以說是合乎時宜的。從他的書名上我們就可猜度出他定然是講些民族英雄一類的故事，當我們把書目翻開一看，這猜度就毫無折扣地證實了。　　書裏包含著歷史上二十五位民族英雄的故事，其姓名為：張騫，衛青，霍去病，李廣，蘇武，趙充國，馬援，班超，劉琨，玄奘，顏果卿，張巡，許遠，狄青，宗澤，岳飛，張世傑，陸秀夫，文天祥，方孝孺，戚繼光，熊廷弼，袁崇煥，史可法，黃道周。</p>
<p>作者寫此書的動機是值得我們贊同的，他在「凡例」第一裏說道：「孟子說：『富貴不能淫，貧賤不能移，威武不能屈，此之謂大丈夫也。』……一個人如果有這樣堅決的自信，有這樣高尚的志願，相信任何偉大不朽的事業和榮譽，一定很容易成就。所以這本書命名為大丈夫，並且希望每個讀者也都學做大丈夫。」在現在，世風之浮滑卑屈，已達極點，甚而還有「只知道給異類效勞，卻忘了種族間的大義」的人，我們若能提出幾個德義具備的歷史人物來作社會大眾的警惕，難道不是一樁挺有意義的事情麼？</p>
<p>作者選錄古人的標準，也為我所同意，他說「……道德與事業並重，而著重點更在道德一方面。因為事業的成敗，大部分是受環境支配的；道德的責任，任何人卻都可以負擔起來。……正義所在，舍命去做，愈是知其不可為而為之，愈是顯出人格的偉大。」這樣的歷史人物，自然不僅是他所選取二十五個，五千年的歷史上有過無數為保障民族的生命而舍身奮鬥的志士，但這些人的事跡大都被後來的史臣抹去，現在我們已無從臆造，所以這書內的二十五人實是代表了歷史上許許多多的民族英雄的全人格的。</p>
<p>這二十五人所屬的時代，有西漢，東漢，東晉，唐，北宋，南宋，明等，而其中一半的人物都是朝代末業的忠臣節士，正是所謂「知其不可為而為之」的大丈夫。大致在一個朝代的末葉，社會一定溺于頹廢，大部分人都在「得過一日且一日」醉生夢死的生活裏，政治的綱紀也一定異常棼亂，奸佞之臣得勢，忠耿之臣遭殃，這時若有人挺身而出，仗義執言，支撐危局，社會視聽為之一新，敬崇之念油然而起，雖然他們的作為到有十分之九結局是失敗的，但「正義自在人心」，每一個稍有良心的人總會紀念著他們，官家文書上固然可以抹殺了他們的豐功偉績，可是仍不能防止民間的流傳，野史，筆記，演義及歌謠裏仍可把他們的事業傳之不朽的。最顯著的例子如岳飛，在正史上的岳飛，衹是一個主戰的人物，他的出戰也並不都是得利，我們讀宋史，往往會覺得處在那樣的危難時候的宋室，秦檜的主和政策並不是怎樣荒謬的，而且他和韓世忠及他們的部下都是一些驕兵悍將，不受中央的號令，召還問罪例成了中央為整飭威命的必要手段了。但這種想以一手掩蓋天下耳目的企圖終是失敗的，我們現在還有許多野史演義存在著，存在數百年來人心中的岳飛卻是演義上的岳飛，是一位「義薄雲天」的民族英雄，是一位忠孝節義俱全的大丈夫。類此者正復不少，我們若能每人都還他們一個本來面目，是一樁意義極大的工作。</p>
<p>范先生的所以寫這本交史上的大丈夫，還不如說他因了感慨時事，借歷史以寄與，借歷史以警惕我人了。他在敘述每一個人的事蹟後，一定附著一段小小的評論，這是作者的真主意，他在「衛青」文後的評論內說道：</p>
<p>「……本來一個民族被別一民族壓迫侵掠，不成問題是要抵抗的，是要報仇的……茍安偷活，唾面自乾，甚至盡量摧殘自己固有的力量，給敵人做先鋒，這種奴性的民族，也一定不容于天地之間的！」</p>
<p>在「警澤」一節後說道：</p>
<p>「北宋末年，力能救國的人才實在不少，忠義氣節，為漢唐所未有……可惜朝廷始終不相信中國人會有抵抗金國的能力，更不相信會有最後成功，因此確著成績像宗澤岳飛諸人，朝廷總不敢冒險信託，恐怕一敗而不可收拾。唐肅宗所以能恢復舊業，關鍵衹在不往四川跑一點上，康王缺乏這種精神，專想委曲求全，茍延殘喘，其實要沒有宗澤岳飛諸人拼命抵抗，偏安局面，怕未必能成立啊！……所以我們知道，一個國家或一個人，在危急環境中，失去了自信力，真是不可救藥的死症。」</p>
<p>在「張世傑，陸秀夫」一節後說：</p>
<p>「這朝立國三百年，對付外國始終是採取最和平最謙恭的態度的。據情理說，外國應該相安無事，不再得寸進尺。可惜遼金元三國，並不懂那些禮讓大義，一味向前掠奪，真太孤負了宋朝一番美意啊！宋太宗北伐失敗，北宋一代，不敢再夢想幽雲十六州；宋高宗逃避江南，南宋一代，君臣安心在小朝廷茍活，不敢再眼望中原。等到臨安陷沒，德祐俘虜，二三孤臣想在炎荒瘴地茍延趙氏一線殘喘，這不算無理吧？最後漂流到海上，不敢再在陸地居住，這更不算無理吧？可是敵人不管你有理無理，總之非徹底撲滅不可。所以看了宋朝的亡國史，知道一個國家自己不努力，對外退讓的結果，痴人也會明白他的命運的。」</p>
<p>上面這幾段話真是多麼沉痛而有力地在鞭擊著現在我們每個人的心上呵！我們自然會瞭解作者的心的，相信凡是讀這幾段文字的人一定會因歷史的殷鑑而想到現在的時事，想到我們目前的處境正是進到了宋朝最末後的幾年上了！</p>
<p>這部書雖然只是復述了一些歷史的事蹟，但是作者的心機一點上，我們已覺的有推崇的價值的。</p>
<p>可惜的是作者不能用文藝的筆法寫下來，要是能寫成歷史小說的形態，其效果一定十百倍於現在。作者很拘泥於歷史的來源，他說「無一語無來歷，無一語無根據……絕對避免演義家的憑臆虛造，混亂事實的弊病。」在他認為是這書的優點，我們卻只能認為是本書的缺點，我們姑不論歷史小說（就是作者所說的演義）是否和作者的認識一樣，即使是憑臆虛造（其實決不是如此），在和作者寫此書的動機上購也是並無矛盾的，作者的「大義」豈非也要借歷史的故實來警惕我們現在的人心麼？我們要求讀者的也並非僅僅「食而不化的知道一點歷史的事情，更重要的是要從這裏獲的嚴肅的教訓，這樣講來，羅列事實顯然比描寫事實差勁多了，這一點我們希望另外有人來擔任，范先生在這裏已經給我們搜集了最詳盡的原料了。」</p>

<p>最近開明書店很出了幾本針對著這個大時代，而為一　青年所十分需要的史地方面的書籍，如：「大丈夫」「國難的故事」「蜀道」等，讀者對於這些書都是很興奮著的，我們從收到了好些關於這幾本書的評論，讀後感等就可知道。本刊上期發表了何似先生的「我們應該往那裏走呢？」本期發表了毅君先生的「評大丈夫」，賈銘先生的「蜀道讀後記」，對於打算讀這些書的，都是頗有用的。</p>
<h3 id="c236">「蜀道」讀後記 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 賈銘</p>
<p>四川一省，自政　統一，治安回復以來因國難日超嚴重的幫故，全國人士對於川省的前途，莫不獲得一種新認識，發生一種新希望；因此該省漸漸成為一全國矚目的標的。</p>
<p>一兩年來關於蜀中考察的文獻，上自成篇巨著，下至零星雜文，散見於報章，雜誌以及梓印刊行的，比較地說，已形相當的熱鬧。但是，就某種立場而論，本人對於本書確具格外的同情，而認為是種相當地正確的記述。</p>
<p>四川，在一般的眼光看起來，總不外是一個物產豐厚，景物美麗的所在。「天府」的概念在任誰中國人的意識中不會模糊；三峭，嘉陵的幽美，永遠是詩人們幻想的內容！不過，在本書裏有更進一步的，面對著現實的發現，使無論那一個中國人領受了之後，在一味艷羨，幻想之外，更不能不發生驚詫和警悟。</p>
<p>據著者的觀感，四川誠不失其「富」和「美」，但若進一步對於人民生活加以考察，則還有一個稀奇的字眼——「慘」。在這個小小的玉國裏，富者自富，貧者自貧，有豐富的物質，不知道利用，有美麗的景物，只供一部分特權階級十足地享受。甚至在盡量地侵略，和剝削下，無力者至於無法生活，結果在死亡率上表現著巨大的數字，以至於婦女無衣褲以掩羞，餓莩盈途而人喫人。</p>
<p>根據著者的耳聞目見，我們可以在一種「信為未有」的情緒下領略下面這許多「慘」的世界的棄寫：</p>
<p>「松潘半邊街居民陳氏，自殺其八歲之親生女而食，不久該婦亦病餓而斃，沿途數百里內，人血及白骨與餓死者，填滿溝壑，令人目不忍睹」。</p>
<p>「三月一日聞曹家溝某家七人，業已餓斃四人，尚餘三人，亦氣息奄奄，……有遠地逃荒飢民多人，經過其地，一併被殺……分割炙食無餘。……」　　在歷史上，國城中往往有「易子而食，析骸而炊」的慘狀；而在這個世代中，竟能以親子「不易」而食，把前者和這相比，未免相形見絀呢！又如某路工向著者訴願說「……吾們都是窮人，做一天，喫一天。農忙時候，不讓種田，硬要我們做工，既不給錢，又不給飯，我們那裏來有餘糧，還不是向四鄰湊借了幾升米，抗著走，走了六十里，繼走到這裏，現在米喫光，工還沒有完，要讓我們餓死在這裏了，……」這怕是更希有的「奇蹟」吧！我們知道：工人口糧的給發，被徴者住居距離工作地點的遠近等，不是都經過中央法令的規定嗎？何以竟有這樣的事實發現呢？我想，除了本書著者的精明和勇敢外，怕不是一般文章和書籍中所能發現的吧。</p>
<p>在這個省區內，還有一種特殊壓榨現象，就是已經許多人相當地報告過的所謂田賦問題，本書中也有深刻詳盡的記載，如下：</p>
<p>「以一百畝為單位，……民國初年，改徴十六圓，防區時代加徴為三十圓，此為一年，亦稱一徴。如一年徴六年，即須一百八十圓；徴十年，即須三百圓；一月徴一年，即須三百六十圓。……有特殊勢力的，田多而糧少；否則田少而糧多，有年年納糧，不知田在何處的，名曰飛糧。……所以究竟多少田應納多少糧，此問題雖田主也沒法回答。……像巴縣一帶，以「擔」計，永川一帶，以「挑」計。……」</p>
<p>「民念二年成都縣，已徴至民國六十八年。……聞最多要算廣源縣，徴到民國一百年。……」</p>
<p>「現時川省人民負擔，以田賦論，雖經省府盡力整理……一年尚須徴至七，八年乃至十年以上之糧。……」</p>
<p>在這種嚴重的負擔下，人民的出路是怎樣呢，強悍點的人們，不外挺而走險，揭扜而起於是有所謂「教匪」「土匪」等的紛紛產出，懦弱無能的就只能陷於「死亡」和「掘尸」的情況之下了。誠如著者說的：「今日可以供匪人誘惑者，明日何嘗不能供敵人利用，……全國大局之憂，即繫於此，誠非可輕視也。」</p>
<p>除了上面這些現實面的暴露外，著者用他清利淺近的文言，描寫著許多美麗的景物，不過著者處處站在教育和社會服務的立場上言，無論什麼記述都採取了常識的和報告的方式。所以本書完全和一般純文藝的遊記大異其趣，而是適於一般需要豐富的常識和聞見的人們所需要的東西。</p>
<p>此外，著者自稱赴川的目的很多，就中尚有所謂：「想看四川一般青年的思想如何？能力如何？將如何修養以負荷未來責任。」的一點，基於此，對男女青年同學們的演講譤，只須時間允許，沒有不答應的，先後演講凡達三十四次，內容涉及的範圍，有救國，立業，婚姻等等方面，據稱有幾次竟然使得許多青年感動得落淚。同時著者常常約了許多青年單獨面談，住寓缺乏坐位，常至席地而談，所以本書除可作遊記書看外，還可作一青年修養書讀。</p>
<p>全書分五段，第一段為蜀遊概念。第二段蜀遊百日記，這是全書的主要部分，舉凡社會生活，山川景物的記述，都包括在本書中。第三段為留告四川青年同學書，這一封信我認為對於一般青年的修養都可給予相當幫助，決非「只有四川青年纔值得讀」的東西。例如所說的：「國難逼迫到這般地步，吾們還能讀死書嗎？……大家把眼光放大起來！」等話，不都是很廣泛而具時效的嗎？第四段為改造新四川管見。據說著者把本書取名為蜀道，有兩個意思：㈠蜀道難之「蜀道」。㈡治蜀之道，本段就是針對著後者而發的。第五段為蜀遊百絕句。這種新異清新的詩格，就一般愛好舊詩的朋友言，也是頗值一讀的東西。</p>
<h3 id="c237">讀「細菌與人」 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 董林</p>
<p>高士其著　開明書店出版　四角五分</p>
<p>「關於細菌學，我……要陸續用淺顯有趣的文字，將這一門神秘微妙的科學，化裝起來，不，裸體起來，使它變成不是專家的奇貨，而是大眾讀者點心而兼補品了……」原書一二一面道是「細菌與人」的作者敘述他寫科學小品的一段自白。在我讀過這本集子之後，確是感覺到作者已經做到了這一地步。</p>
<p>科學本是人生最實用，最需要的一種知識。人類要征服自然，非得請教科學先生不可。</p>
<p>普通的科學讀物，都好像是道學先生一樣，使人敬而畏之，一般人都不敢向他領教。</p>
<p>如果是有人給科學文章穿上文藝的裝服來和大眾見面，我想大眾必定很歡喜去親近他，向他領教的。</p>
<p>細菌與人這本科學小品集，就是眼前一個實例。（聽說有好多人都很歡迎作者文章。）</p>
<p>這本冊子是由二十九篇科學小品集成的，大部分是細菌方面的知識。細菌學本是部專門的學問。專門學者寫出來的細菌書，大概都是乾燥無味的專門書，是一般人所不歡迎的。而作者卻用輕松的小品文，寫出了這門科學的常識，使人讀來津津有味，不覺得枯燥。這是非常可喜的。</p>
<p>在科學小品的寫作上，作者可說是很成功的。他的成功，是憑了他那不可多得的才能獲得的。</p>
<p>第一，他能把枯燥無味的科學知識，寫得非常有趣。有些地方簡直帶著不少的幽默意味，使讀者看到那里，禁不住要在口角上浮出微笑來。</p>
<p>第二，作者能够很巧妙的把科學知識跟人事混合著描寫，而且能够把雙方聯繫得自然，不覺生硬。他常常借題發揮，諷刺人間的醜惡。本來是冷冰冰的說理的科學文章，在作者的筆下竟變成了很有生氣的含有情感的小品文。這不能不說是作者成功。</p>
<p>第三，作者有時用歷史的寫法，寫出科學家對細菌作戰的史實，啟示讀者人類應如何努力去跟自然鬥爭，以求得自身的幸福。這也是一種很好的寫法。</p>
<p>第四，作者的文筆非常流利，當然也是成功要素之一。</p>
<p>作者在寫作技巧上是成功了。有時也許是作者太注重了技巧上用工夫吧，有少數的文章不免在內容上有點弄得不够充實。例如，談色盲那一篇，在我就覺得對於色盲的道理，寫得不充分。我以為寫科學小品，不應該只寫寫表面的現象，更應該闡明它的本質。作者不只是想使讀者知道某一事態的。當然，更應該使他明瞭它的「所以然」。我相信細菌與人的作者，憑他的才能，是可以做到「用淺顯有趣的文字」，寫出神秘奧妙的科學真理來的。</p>
<p>大概是不留心吧，作者有時會在筆下流露出一些傳統的意識。例如。什麼「天公……有好生之德」。這樣的話，是不應該在一個科學者的作品里發現的。我們知道自然界的變化都是依了自然法則在那里進行的，決不是由什麼「天公」支配的。希望作者以後下筆再留神一點。</p>
<p>有人說這本集子里面有幾篇文章，雖然很美，不過所含的文言文成份，似乎太濃厚了，不是大眾所能看得懂的。這確是不可否認的事實。不過關於這一點，作者在他新近發表的文章裏，已經糾正過來了。</p>
<p>總括起來說，就大體上看去，細菌與人是一本非常優秀的科學小品集，是一本值得一讀的好書。</p>

<p>(Guihua) Pan and Wang telegraphed from Sui on the 30th, reporting that the puppet bandit army was plotting a counter-offensive against Bailingmiao, which was very urgent. Prince Yun had dispatched Mongolian soldiers to guard the mansion, and our army had also sent a team for protection. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) The puppet bandit army is currently using the Damiaozi area of the Ulanqab League as a base, attempting to counter-attack Bailingmiao. Our troops are vying to volunteer, and morale is extremely high. Chen Cheng is scheduled to leave Sui on the night of the 30th and will inspect Pingdiquan upon arrival.

Chen will inspect Pingdiquan and is scheduled to go to Datong via Bing on the 1st. Zhao will arrange military affairs in Pingdiquan and continue to be stationed in eastern Sui. Wang Jingguo is scheduled to return to Baotou on the 1st to inspect defense affairs. Our defense in northern and eastern Sui is solid, and the puppet bandits' counter-attack will definitely not succeed. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) The Kawakishi Brigade is currently stationed in northern Chahar and has decided to use Wang Jingxiu's troops of the Rehe Army as the foremost line of attack against Sui. Prince De is still in the West Sunid Banner and has not returned to Jiasita. Three thousand soldiers of the garrison in Kangbao arrived in Jiasita early on the 30th. One thousand artillerymen from the Rehe Army stationed in Jiageying are heading towards the front line in eastern Sui. Three thousand of Zhang Haipeng's troops have reached the front line in Shangdu. Zhuo Shihai led two thousand Mongolian cavalry from Pangjiang back to Shangdu. On the 30th, ten trucks of gasoline were transported from Zhangbei to Nanhaoqian and from Duolun to Jiasita. Thirteen trucks of military supplies, including new-style machine guns and bullets, and three trucks of 200-pound bombs. The people of a certain country stationed in Zhangbei have all returned to Rehe, and wealthy families are mostly fleeing into the interior. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A Jining dispatch reports that a meeting of bandit puppet leaders in Jiasita was convened by Muto, the second section chief of the Kwantung Army Department, Staff Officer Onodera, and Yoshioka, a senior staff officer of the 7th Division of the Rehe Army, etc. The bandit puppet army and the Rehe puppet support army were divided into two branches: one for defense, using Shangdu as a base, to be undertaken by Wang Ying, Li Shouxin, etc.; and one for attack, to be undertaken by Bao Yueqing, Zhuo Shihai, and Gan Jingxiu's puppet Rehe army. Each branch has a force of approximately 30,000 men, with attached air force and armored car units. The defensive posture has already begun. The offensive is aimed at Bailingmiao, but has not yet been launched. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A Jining dispatch reports that the Xinghe-Taolin line is still peaceful. A portion of Wang Ying and Li Shouxin's forces are gathered at Daqinggou, northwest of Taolin Erdaoba. Although bandits appear from time to time, they are all repelled by our army. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) The generals here are discussing strategies for suppressing bandits in eastern and northern Sui. The result is reportedly a concrete plan has been drafted and telegraphed to Chairman Chiang for approval. Even if the puppet bandits try to attack again, it will be difficult for them to succeed. Wang Jingguo plans to return to Baotou within days to decide on defense. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Tang Enbo has completed his mission in Sui. On the afternoon of the 30th, he and Zhang Guanze, a counselor from the Bandit Suppression Headquarters, took the Ping-Sui express train to inspect defense affairs on the front line. Fu Zuoyi personally went to the station to see them off. Division commanders Gan Zhonglian and Wang Wanling returned to their defense positions on the morning of the 30th. Other generals will also return to their defense positions separately. The Mongolian puppet bandit army is indeed planning to attack Bailingmiao again. The national army has strengthened its defenses, and the bandits and puppets will definitely not succeed. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Dami Ling Sulong visited Chen Cheng and Fu Zuoyi for instructions and returned to the four banners in eastern Sui on the night of the 30th. Da expressed that he has known Prince De for a long time and can still be his friend if Prince De defects. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Zong Weigeng and others came to Sui to film a battlefield movie. On the 30th, they filmed close-ups of Dami Ling Sulong, Prince Zhao, and others. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) The postal route to Bailingmiao will be restored soon. The Ping Post Office Administration has sent personnel to Sui to prepare. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Five members of the Northeast Volunteer Army, including Li Futong, visited Fu Zuoyi on the 30th, requesting to be sent to the front line. Fu comforted them. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sources related to Zhangbei report that military officers from a certain country have convened meetings of bandit puppet leaders in Shangdu for several days, deciding to form a forward coercion corps, divided into reserve and vanguard types, with a quota of 1,500 people. No guns are issued, but each person carries bombs and large knives, specifically for charging into close combat. They are currently recruiting desperados with large sums of money for training. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to Mongolian sources, Prince De, recently angered and humiliated by accusations from various parties, has decided to stubbornly resist to the end. He recently reached an agreement with a certain country that if he can recapture Bailingmiao, any conditions can be accommodated as much as possible. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) Jin Jiasan has been transferred back to Rehe and sentenced to death. The puppet Rehe army of Zhang Haipeng is busy building fortifications in Weichang. The bandit forces in Shangdu are about to be disbanded, and they will inevitably flee to northern Chahar. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Guihua dispatch reports that the bandits in Xinghe were repelled by Li Fuying's troops some days ago, and the bandits fled towards Nanhaoqian. There are no bandit traces within Xinghe. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Zhangbei said that the guns and weapons led by a certain country and used by the bandit puppet army were all manufactured at the Shenyang Arsenal in the Republic of China's 17th and 18th years. The rifles are Czech-style. Since the bandit puppet army has been under the jurisdiction and command of a certain country, since March and April, the supplies, in addition to requisitioning locally, the puppet soldiers are only given one yuan per month for food expenses, and the bandits use counterfeit money, which is forced into circulation. The farmers in the counties of northern Chahar are extremely miserable. The bandit puppet army is closely monitored, but due to the lack of clothing and food, there are desertions at any time. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to as yet unconfirmed news from Pingdiquan, a portion of the bandit army led by Li Shouxin has defected in Jiasita, destroying the headquarters there. Li himself has also decided to surrender. According to reports, Wang Ying's mixed Mongolian army surrendered earlier at a location twenty miles north of Shangdu. Currently, northern and eastern Sui are very peaceful. However, it is said that the "Manchukuo" Mongolian army is still planning to try again. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telegram from Suiyuan, Chen Cheng is scheduled to go to Bailingmiao in the next day or two to inspect the front lines and encourage the soldiers there. (30th Allied Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Chen Cheng hosted the press on the afternoon of the 29th. First, his secretary-general Zhuang Mingyuan briefly described Chen's itinerary and mission to Sui. Then, Chen met with reporters from the Central News Agency and delivered a speech, which was extremely solemn and powerful. Chen answered questions from the reporters and talked for a long time. Chen said that Fu Chairman is responsible for suppressing the bandits in Suiyuan, and the Four Provinces Bandit Suppression Headquarters does not intend to establish an office in Suiyuan. The defeat of the puppet bandits in northeastern Sui is the first step in the national war of resistance. The puppet army that has come to surrender should be accepted. The Communist bandits in northern Shaanxi have been blockaded and can be eliminated. Chen solemnly declared that any evil force that endangers our country and nation and damages the integrity of our land will be eliminated and will not be tolerated. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Tang Enbo visited Fu Zuoyi and Chen Cheng on the 29th and is scheduled to return to his defense position within days. On the 29th, Tang led all the officers and soldiers to send a letter to their comrades in eastern and northern Sui, expressing their admiration for Fu's infantry and Zhao's cavalry and sent personnel to comfort them. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Discrepancies in Opinions of Japanese Military Departments Regarding the Sui Incident; Ishihara Arrives in Tianjin with Mission to Mediate; Headquarters in Changchun Receives Telegram; Japanese Warship from Lushun Sails to Tanggu and Anchors <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) A staff officer from a certain military department in Tianjin stated that Ishihara's arrival in Tianjin is primarily intended to unify the opinions of the Kwantung and North China military departments regarding foreign affairs. After arriving in Peiping, he will proceed to Zhangbei for inspection. While the Sui battle is difficult to resolve immediately, rumors of what the Kwantung Army Department will do are mostly exaggerated propaganda. It is also heard that the North China and Kwantung military departments still have discrepancies in their opinions regarding direct participation in the Sui incident. The central headquarters also recently sent a telegram to Changchun, presenting several points. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Guan Chuan, an official from the Japanese Consulate General in Tianjin who was sent to Shanxi and Suiyuan to investigate our military affairs and popular sentiment, returned to Tianjin on the 30th and reported to Horiuchi. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The destroyer "Ran" of the 14th Destroyer Squadron of the Lushun Naval Port Department arrived in Tanggu and anchored on the evening of the 29th for security in case of emergency. If necessary, it will be deceived to Tianjin. Experts familiar with diplomacy and military affairs here say that although the expansion of the Sui incident is unavoidable, if our entire country can maintain its unity, encourage local morale, and supply the front lines, a certain country, even if it has the intention to launch, will hesitate and dare not make an immediate decision. Because those who preside over the Sui war are ultimately responsible to the Kwantung Army Department due to the limitations of authority. The military department within the pass is limited by region and cannot directly participate. The Kwantung can mobilize at most three divisions, which, based on the wartime establishment of each division as Class A, totals no more than 50,000. Its domestic headquarters has no intention of expanding the war. Therefore, the unavoidable thing about transferring troops to participate in the war is that the Kwantung military department is riding a tiger and must fight to maintain the morale of the puppet organization. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ishihara, the chief of the First Section of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters, came to Peiping on official business and is scheduled to go to Changchun on the morning of the 1st after completing his work. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Tashiro, Accompanied by Staff, Inspects Japanese Troops on the Beining Line; Tianjin Japanese Troops Continue Exercises at Dabizhuang; Veterans Association Recruiting New Members <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Tashiro, accompanied by staff members such as Hashimoto, Senida, Asai, Adachi, Suzuki, and Kawada, went to inspect the military along the Beining Railway line, including Yu, Qin, Tang, Ao, etc., at 8:00 AM on the 30th. He will return to Tianjin on the 2nd and then go to Peiping and Fengtai to inspect the garrison. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Kayashima and Suzuki regiments of the Tianjin Japanese Army continued their exercises at Dabizhuang on the 30th. Veterans also participated. The Tianjin Veterans Association will recruit new members starting on the 1st to be incorporated into the garrison's reserve force. There are already 300 members, and Japanese residents will join. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin Japanese military department is still insisting on recommending Lieutenant General Fujita Junnaka, the chief director of the Veterans Association, as the head of the Japanese Concession militia, sidelining Usukawa Noboru. The reason given is that North China is in an extraordinary period, and only a military person as the head of the militia can maintain close contact with the garrison. Although Usukawa was elected, he has not dared to come to Tianjin. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tashiro, accompanied by his staff, arrived in Tangshan on the 30th and immediately inspected the local garrison. At 2:00 PM, he went to Shanhaiguan. He began inspecting the garrison there at 8:00 AM on the 1st. He went to Qin at noon and returned to Shanhaiguan in the evening. He will return to Tianjin on the 2nd, continuously inspecting various places along the Luan and Chang Tang. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Omoto, the head of the Zhangjiakou Japanese Special Service Agency, came to Tianjin on the afternoon of the 30th to report on the situation in Sui and Chahar. He flew back to Zhang on the 1st. Yin (Rugeng) came to Tianjin on the evening of the 29th to visit Tashiro and Horiuchi for discussions and returned to Tongzhou on the 30th. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Internal Discord within the Puppet Organization <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Due to the many internal factions within the puppet organization, there are signs of disintegration. They are also afraid of the expansion of the Sui war and the recovery by the armed forces of the Ji-Cha garrison. Both superiors and subordinates are panicked. Those managing finances have recently embezzled and fled to avoid disaster. The puppet Jidong government has allocated one million yuan to assist the puppet Chahar army of Wang Ying and Li Shouxin, saying that they share the same anti-communist goals and will provide donations successively in the future. This sum was handed over to a certain country by Yin (Rugeng) on the 30th for transfer. Yin also allocated 20,000 yuan as a condolence payment for the suicide of the garrison commander of Shanhaiguan, Furuta. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Redeployment of the Japanese South China Fleet <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Xiamen) The Japanese South China Fleet has been redeployed. Four ships, including the destroyer "Akikaze" of the Fourth Destroyer Squadron, arrived in Xiamen on the evening of the 29th. It is stated that there are now five Japanese warships stationed in Xiamen, including the "Wakatake," which was originally anchored. The Japanese and Taiwanese Residents Association announced that for the redeployment of the Imperial Fleet in South China, a farewell reception will be held on the 1st. Suga, the Fujian military officer, arrived in Xiamen from the province on the 30th and met with Ota, the Guangdong military officer. The city government hosted a luncheon for Suga.

<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan, accompanied by Liu Ruming, Zhang Zizhong, and others, went to Nanyuan this morning to inspect the garrison and visit the headquarters of the 29th Army. He returned to the city in the afternoon. (30th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Yan Xishan telegraphed Wei Huai on the 29th to express his congratulations. The original telegram stated, "This time, the Suiyuan bandit suppression military campaign received the guidance of Chairman Chiang and the devoted efforts of the soldiers at the front line, resulting in a small victory. The strategy came from the central government, and the results belong to the troops. What strength do I have? I am ashamed to accept such embellishment." He also telegraphed Chen Shuren on the 10th in reply to express his thanks, stating, "When the bandit puppets invade Sui, I will resolutely kill the bandits to fulfill the soldier's duty to defend the country, and I pray that you will convey this to overseas compatriots in various places." (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The party departments of various districts in Nanjing previously sent a telegram to Ge Xishan to express their condolences. They recently received a telegram of thanks from Ge, stating, "When the bandit puppets invade Sui, it is our responsibility to defend the territory. Fortunately, with the guidance of the central government, we achieved a small victory. I am deeply grateful for your encouragement. Our army's morale has been boosted since the capture of Bailingmiao. We will follow the central government's lead and drive forward to kill the bandits to fulfill our duty to defend the country." (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yan Xishan telegraphed Zhang Tiechang on the 29th, saying, "I have read your telegram. The victory in bandit suppression in northern Sui was due to the guidance of Chairman Chiang and the efforts of the soldiers at the front line. The strategy came from the central government, and the results belong to the troops. What strength do I have? I am ashamed to accept such embellishment." (30th Dispatch)</p>

The Italian government hopes that the two countries will continue to cooperate. Regarding reports of an Italian-Japanese agreement, Lojacono gave a slight explanation. Foreign Minister Zhang also inquired in detail, and Luo agreed to telegraph his government for instructions and a reply, but stated that Italy's friendly relations with China remain unchanged. In addition, it is rumored that the signing of an Italian-Japanese agreement has been rumored for several months, and the international community has also paid attention. However, at that time, there was no mention of Italy recognizing "a puppet state." The so-called "Italian government will recognize the puppet state" is only a recent rumor. According to those who understand the international situation, the international situation is changing, and after the recent dissemination of the German-Japanese agreement, various countries are seriously considering it. Now there is another rumor of an Italian-Japanese agreement, and the trend of alliances is gradually forming. The international community recognizes that the road ahead is thorny and not easy to clear. (30th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) The detailed content of the two major contracts signed by the Guangzhou Municipal Government with British commercial firms is now known. It is reported that the total value of the two contracts is approximately 5.45 million yuan, of which the contract signed with Malcolm and Company accounts for 2.25 million yuan and is used to expand and improve the Guangzhou Waterworks and distribution system. Another 3.2 million yuan is the contract signed with the China General Electric Company for the procurement of streetcars. It is reported that negotiations on the above two contracts have been going on for two years during the Chen Jitang era in Guangdong, but they were actively pursued after Zeng Yangfu took office as the Mayor of Guangzhou this August. In the contract signed with General Electric Company, the municipal government agreed to order from the company all electrical and machinery equipment required for the first phase of the streetcar project, including 64 streetcar chassis, all electrical and pneumatic brake equipment, 18 and a half miles of double track, and application materials for two streetcar depots with a capacity of 40 streetcars each. The company agreed that the municipal government will pay off the goods in installments over a period of two years, paying once every three months, for a total of 24 installments, but starting from the fourth installment, interest at an annual rate of 6% must be paid together. This streetcar project is part of the program to improve the Guangzhou urban traffic, because the urban traffic is now very inconvenient. As for the contract signed with Malcolm and Company, it is also scheduled to pay off the goods in installments over six years, paying once a month, with an annual interest rate of 6%. The collateral is the entire surplus income of the waterworks, and it is guaranteed by the City Bank. If the income is insufficient to pay off the debt, the bank will make up for it, and a custodial fund committee will be established with five members, three appointed by the municipal government and two elected by the company, whose responsibilities and obligations will be the receipt and payment of surplus income.

<p>(Guangzhou) Yu Hanmou and Huang Musong jointly telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, Chairman Chiang, and Minister Kong on the 30th, requesting a temporary suspension of the foreign rice tax, stating that Guangdong has suffered from summer floods, autumn droughts, and the disaster is already evident. The price of rice is only six or seven catties per yuan, and there is a tendency to continue rising. There is no surplus grain in the market, and people's food is worrying. Moreover, as winter approaches, the danger is everywhere. Without suppressing the price of rice, it is impossible to alleviate the people's difficulties. The foreign rice tax was originally intended to prevent dumping, and it should be flexible. Now that there is a shortage of grain, it can be adjusted according to the situation to regulate the market. Please order a temporary exemption from collection, and then consider restoring it when the early rice harvest is abundant next year. The people of Guangdong will be deeply grateful.

<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The Xiamen people's support for Suiyuan's donation is extremely enthusiastic. On the morning of the 25th, a woman stood in front of the Jiangsheng Newspaper, reading the posted newspapers for about half an hour. She immediately entered the newspaper office, took off her gold ring, and asked the newspaper to sell it for money to send to Suiyuan, to comfort the loyal and brave soldiers fighting for the country and the nation in the bitter cold of 15 degrees below zero Celsius on the front line. However, the woman did not give her name, and only requested that the receipt be written as "Nameless Person." The newspaper took the ring to a pawnshop and valued it at seven yuan. Therefore, the newspaper specially published a notice claiming to sell it publicly. On the 26th, Wu Potang sent a letter to the newspaper, willing to buy it for double the price, fourteen yuan, but would give way to a higher price. The newspaper thought it was a good price and was about to sell it, but on the 27th, Chuan Weige, manager of Xiamen Hehe Automobile Company, brought twenty yuan to buy it as a gift for his wife, but declared that he would still give way if there was a higher price. On the 28th, five young siblings surnamed Zhang pooled their money to bid for twenty-eight yuan, sending a letter to the newspaper roughly stating, "Last night, we heard our parents say that a nameless woman took off and sold her gold ring to comfort the soldiers fighting against the enemy in Suiyuan. Mr. Fu bought it for twenty yuan yesterday, but if there is a higher price, Mr. Fu is willing to give way. Our brothers and sisters were all moved and secretly held a meeting, deciding to spend our usual savings of candy money, twenty-eight yuan, to buy the nameless woman's ring. Our parents were very happy and nodded in agreement. Now, please ask your newspaper to notify Mr. Fu to let us have it, but if anyone is willing to pay a higher price than us, we will certainly give way to help the front-line soldiers get more assistance. Wishing you peace, Zhang Guomei, Zhang Jiamei, Zhang Yiwei, Zhang Qiumei, Zhang Hengwei, respectfully." The newspaper asked Fu, who was willing to give it up and did not take back the twenty yuan, which was also used to comfort the soldiers at the front. (November 29th)</p>

<h3 id="e56">The Japanese Political Parties Amidst the Voices for Parliamentary Reform (Part 1) <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Nan Yun</p>
<p>Recently, what has caused a sensation in Tokyo is the "Parliamentary Reform Bill" and the completion of the new Diet building.</p>
<p>The plan to build the Diet building dates back to the 19th year of the Meiji era. It was not until the 6th year of the Taisho era that the "Diet Building Investigation Committee" was established. The formal construction began in the 9th year of the Taisho era. After such a long period of time, the magnificence and splendor of its architecture is naturally as expected. It is no wonder that Japanese newspapers have greatly exaggerated it, calling it "the culmination of the efforts of the people for twenty years, the majestic appearance of a purely domestic grand building, and a symbol of Japan's brilliant progress."</p>
<p>However, who can say that it is not a disappointing thing? Just when the new Diet building was completed, and the Emperor personally visited and held a grand and solemn completion ceremony, the "Parliamentary Reform Bill" proposed by the military was causing a great stir and widespread anxiety during this period. Perhaps this was unexpected when planning to build the Diet building!</p>
<p>According to news reports, the military's views on the "Parliamentary Reform Bill" are:</p>
<p>(1) Deny the party cabinet system. Separate the legislative, executive, and judicial powers. Prohibit political parties that hold a majority in the parliament from forming a government.</p>
<p>(2) Stipulate the Political Parties Law. The scope of political parties' activities shall be stipulated by law.</p>
<p>(3) The parliament shall not have the power to impeach the government.</p>
<p>(4) Restrict the activities of professional representatives in the parliament.</p>
<p>(5) Change the function of the House of Peers and establish an Economic Advisory Headquarters. The House of Representatives may participate in expressing opinions on matters such as "economic legislation."</p>
<p>(6) Reject universal suffrage. The right to vote is limited to heads of households and those who have completed military service obligations.</p>
<p>However, on November 6, regarding the "Parliamentary Reform Bill," Minister of the Army Terauchi's explanation to the cabinet ministers was:</p>
<p>(1) Based on the fundamental meaning of the national polity, give full play to the true essence of the Imperial Constitution, and move towards the path of Japan's unique constitutional political development.</p>
<p>(2) Strictly abide by the parliamentary powers stipulated in the Imperial Constitution and seek its appropriate application.</p>
<p>(3) Accurately and smoothly convey public opinion, so that fair public opinion and the wisdom of the people can be fully reflected in national affairs.</p>
<p>The Minister of the Army's statement is naturally very vague. What is meant by the path of constitutional political development, and how is it unique? What does it mean to seek its appropriate application, and how should it be applied to be appropriate? As for the third point, it is clearly pointed out that the current Japanese parliament cannot smoothly convey public opinion, nor can it adopt fair public opinion and apply the wisdom of the people.</p>
<p>This kind of open attack on the parliament can be said to have been planned by the military for a long time. As early as the "February 26th Incident," when the number of political party cabinet members was restricted, the clues had already been revealed. The current problem lies only in how the parliament itself will struggle and how it will respond.</p>
<p>On November 5, Secretary-General Nagai of the Minseitō (Constitutional Democratic Party) and Secretary-General Andō of the Seiyūkai (Friends of Constitutional Government Party) held a major meeting regarding the parliamentary reform issue, discussing the "Issue of Party Reorganization" and the "Issue of Parliamentary Politics." The discussion concluded that the recent rumors of denying the party cabinet and fundamentally reforming the parliamentary system seemed to be an attempt to realize fascist dictatorship. This kind of proposition not only violates the spirit of the Constitution but is also not suitable for the Japanese national character. Therefore, political parties should unanimously resist this issue. The two parties, the Minseitō and the Seiyūkai, should also jointly consult on this issue in the future, abandon their past differences of opinion, and seek party reorganization with an open mind. (Asahi Shimbun, November 6)</p>
<p>After the leaders of the two parties reached such an agreement, some people believed that a direct conflict between the Japanese parliament and the military would become inevitable in the future. In fact, this is not the case. Behind both the Minseitō and the Seiyūkai are financial cliques supporting them. The two so-called oldest major political parties (Minseitō and Seiyūkai) are, in fact, nothing more than spokespersons for the two major financial cliques. The interests of the military and the financial cliques sometimes conflict, but their fundamental interests (suppressing domestic revolutionary ideas, ruling and developing overseas colonies) are always consistent. In the current so-called Japanese emergency period, neither the military nor the financial cliques are willing to conflict with each other. Whenever the opposition between them becomes very sharp, they will come up with peaceful ways to resolve it peacefully. Why should this parliamentary issue be any different?</p>
<p>Since the "September 18th Incident," because of its willingness to invest in the puppet state of Manchukuo, the relationship between the Mitsubishi financial clique and the military is clearly closer than that of Mitsui. The attitudes of the two major financial cliques towards the military have formed different political views between the two major political parties. This can also be seen in the recent parliamentary reform issue.</p>
<p>The attitude of the Minseitō has been easing since Minister of the Army Terauchi issued a statement. Chief Secretary Sakurai of the party said: "This issue is a major issue since the beginning of constitutional government. Before the facts are clarified, major political parties cannot but be cautious in handling this issue. We hope that the military and the people will truly融洽 and overcome national difficulties. In the event that the essence of constitutional government is destroyed and parliamentary politics is denied, we cannot but have a major awakening for the sake of the country." Doesn't this completely express the Minseitō's willingness to compromise on this issue? On the contrary, the Seiyūkai, which represents the Mitsui financial clique, has a stronger attitude. The Asahi Shimbun of November 7 reported:</p>
<p>"The Seiyūkai's attitude is somewhat stronger than that of the Minseitō, but it still adopts a strategy of observing the situation and dealing with it. Since the Minseitō's highest policy has been decided to be self-restraint, the cooperation between the two parties, the Minseitō and the Seiyūkai, with the parliamentary reform issue as the center, will in fact be impossible to realize. The opposition between the military and the political parties will tend to ease with the statement of the Minseitō leadership as a turning point."</p>
<p>The Asahi Shimbun's speculation is very accurate. Serious problems are placed before the financial cliques and the military, and they will not fail to cooperate.</p>
<p>What are the serious problems? They are: the activity of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, the rise of anti-Japanese sentiment in China, the secret organizations of revolutionary people in Korea, and the left-wing movement within Japan. On November 9, the Japanese Minister of Justice made the following remarks:</p>
<p>"Looking at the recent situation of ideological movements in Japan, the so-called left-wing ideological movements are difficult to be optimistic about. Since the 7th International Congress last summer decided on a new movement policy, it seems to have spread to the communist movement in Japan. Avoiding illegal movements and adopting legal movement methods make it even more difficult to crack down on. In addition, the anarchist movement, which has been dormant for a long time, has been secretly active in various places for several years...</p>

<h3 id="e57">The Significance of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland Joining the Gold Agreement <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>On October 13 of this year, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France concluded a gold agreement. On November 23, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland also announced their accession to this agreement. According to overseas dispatches on the same day, the six countries will subsequently take various measures in terms of technology to enable the implementation of exchange equalization funds. And the monetary policies of the countries can also be adjusted. How the accession of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland to the gold agreement will affect the world's economy and politics, at a time when the two camps of aggression and peace are becoming increasingly clear, is worth noting.</p>
<p>We know that the basic purpose of the gold agreement is to establish a stable international monetary plan in a spirit of cooperation. And the controlled devaluation of the franc is the beginning of this cooperative approach. However, there are two reasons why the United Kingdom, the United States, and France resolutely adopted this cooperative approach. First, after the lessons learned since 1931, the United Kingdom and the United States deeply know that relying solely on the weapon of currency devaluation is obviously not enough to resolve international contradictions. Especially in the current international market, if the franc is allowed to devalue freely, it will inevitably cause extremely strong fluctuations in the economies of the United Kingdom and the United States. This is unfavorable from any point of view. In order to avoid the cycle of currency devaluation, the controlled devaluation of the franc is extremely welcome to the United Kingdom and the United States. Second, in the current world economy, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France occupy a major position in terms of production, trade, investment, and finance. In 1935, the total amount of imports and exports of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France was US$7.25 billion. Germany, Italy, and Japan, on the other hand, are worth only US$3.304 billion. The difference is nearly 400 million yuan. On such a superior economic basis, if the economic equilibrium is once again broken due to the currency war, it is naturally a counterproductive endeavor. From these two reasons, the formation of a gold front by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France has obvious objective significance in international economics and politics.</p>
<p>The Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland all have important economic relations in Europe and the Far East. Now that they have joined the gold front, the significance of this is naturally roughly the same as that of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. Here, we see that the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland cannot only integrate with the aggressive groups in Europe, but also easily promote irreconcilable economic conflicts with Japan in the Far East. Especially the Netherlands in the Far East colonies is like this.</p>
<p>The accession of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland to the gold front also contains a very important fundamental issue, which is the issue of preventing the outflow of "panic capital" in the European market. Everyone knows that it is impossible to completely eradicate the outflow of "panic capital". Because in today's war terror, the escape of "panic capital" is inevitable. However, if the basic goal of the gold agreement is to become a means of balancing economic relations between the six countries, it must slow down the phenomenon of "gold pouring out" of Europe. Otherwise, it will not be beneficial to the six countries. According to recent phenomena, the United States has obviously played a very important supporting role in this regard. It can be seen that the United States can still stand on the gold front and work hard to support European international peace relations.</p>

<p>Goslar City: Minister of Aviation and Dictator of the Four-Year Plan, General Göring, recently delivered a speech at the German Farmers' Congress, stating: "The German army is strong enough to protect the country.

Not only that, but we have now formed a connection with a major power in the Far East in terms of ideology." (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Göring also called on all German farmers to help him implement the four-year plan, and said that some German farmers had urged him to give a slightly higher price so as to encourage farmers to sell their products, otherwise they would be reluctant to sell, and the result would be to make prices tend to rise. Göring continued, "If German farmers can fulfill their duties, then Germany's daily bread needs not be supplied by foreign countries. The current territory of Germany is too small to accommodate a population of 60 million. If the population reaches the expected 90 million in the future, it will be even more difficult to accommodate." Göring concluded, "If the Führer has the necessity to call on you, I deeply believe that all German farmers will use their iron arms that they usually hold hoes to change into arms to defend the motherland."

<p>(Berlin) Member of the German House of Representatives, Mr. Hess, gave a speech here today, severely criticizing Bolshevism, saying that before the European War, British General Kitchener once said to a certain German officer that the rulers of the world were narrow-minded and that he expected a world war to come, which was inevitable. Today, Bolshevism is no different from this. However, the world will thank Germany in the future for being a barrier against Bolshevism. Hess finally expressed his condolences to Hitler for establishing the German-Japanese alliance to reduce the threat of the Bolshevik Party. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Chairman of the Soviet Russian People's Committee, Molotov, gave a speech at the All-Union Congress today, stating that the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact is nothing more than a secret appendix, especially a smokescreen for a plan against Soviet Russia. At present, German strategists believe that they have been rectified and ready for foreign adventures, and have chosen countries to form alliances with. As for Japan, it now feels that it can freely turn its military power into an alliance for the realization of the German fascist country's adventure plans in colonies and various lootings. Mo also said that the fascist leaders of Germany are "modern cannibals" and should be distinguished from the German masses. However, at present, these people seem to have been麻醉ed by large-scale parades and exaggerated speeches. The Soviet Union has no malice towards the great German people, except to express friendship and sincere regrets. According to Mo's speech criticizing Fascism today, it has been the second time in two days. Yesterday, Mo also had a speech criticizing Fascism at the All-Union Congress as follows: "We do not need alliances or协的, what we rely on is our own growing strength. We are very busy dealing with our own domestic affairs, and we have no time to pay attention to foreign conspiracies. However, for the sake of peace, we are willing to cooperate with other countries within the framework of the League of Nations. Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations is for the freedom of aggression. The German-Japanese agreement is nothing more than a smokescreen for an anti-Soviet war. At present, there are two forces in the world, namely communism that tends to peace and fascism that tends to war." (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Air Force Deputy Commander Kipulin claimed in a speech at the All-Union Congress here today that next year, the Soviet Air Force will be the first in the world in terms of quality and quantity. This year, the Soviet Air Force that can fight will have 100,000 people, and the national aircraft production last year has doubled. Kipushi continued, "At present, we have hundreds of air force fighters with a speed of 360 miles per hour, which can parachute a battalion of fully armed soldiers behind the enemy in ten minutes." Kipushi finally said, "If Germany invades the Soviet Union, it will not be spared from disaster." (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Air Force Deputy Commander Kliben reported to the Soviet National Congress today that the Soviet Union has 7,000 fighter planes, more than any country in the world. Germany has between 6,000 and 7,000 fighter planes. The Soviet Union and Germany each have 1,000 first-line aircraft, but in terms of combat effectiveness, the Soviet Air Force is the best in the world. Keli's report surprised foreign observers, because according to foreign estimates, the total number of Soviet aircraft is less than 4,000. Keli continued, according to the figures released by Germany, Japan has 2,500 aircraft, the United States 2,700, and France 2,200. At present, Germany, Italy, and Japan need aircraft more urgently than any country, so the arms race is in progress. At present, there are 17,000 to 18,000 aircraft in various capitalist countries, which will be increased to 17,000 to 18,000 in the next two years. In the past ten months, the Soviet Union has manufactured 94.5% more aircraft than the total output last year. The number of army aircraft is now four times more than in 1932. Most of them can reach a speed of 315 miles per hour, and can be increased to 420 miles per hour. If Germany has 75,000 drivers in the near future, the Soviet Union will have 100,000. If the German National Socialists dare to threaten the Soviet Union with the Air Force, they will definitely be unfortunate. In addition, it is known that the Soviet Union also has many three-engine bombers that can carry heavy loads, but their speed is slower than that of British, German, and American bombers. Soviet factories are now trying their best to manufacture high-speed aircraft. (29th, Kuomintang dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) The British government received a telegram from Berlin today guaranteeing that there are no secret clauses in the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact signed recently. Informed sources believe that this guarantee from Berlin can dispel the panic among British people that there are other unpublished clauses in the pact. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received a telegram from Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Sugimura Yōtarō, regarding the Japanese-Italian agreement issue on the 30th. Foreign Minister Arita immediately met with Director-General of the European and Asian Affairs Bureau, Higashi Kyō, and Director-General of the Commerce Bureau, Matsushima, on the morning of the 30th to discuss the content of the instruction. The instruction will be issued by the evening of the 30th, and all the facts may be announced as soon as possible. It is said that the exchange of recognition of "Manchukuo" and the annexation of Abyssinia will be issued by means of exchanging documents, so as to avoid creating the impression of a formal agreement. In addition, a trade agreement seems to be signed. A spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that Italy and Japan have not yet reached complete agreement, and that it is not yet time to confirm or deny the news about the recognition of "Manchukuo" and Abyssinia. When talking about the Chinese authorities' statement on the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact, the spokesman said that this statement does not affect the Sino-Japanese negotiations, because Japan was fully aware of the Chinese government's attitude towards the anti-communist issue before the announcement of the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact. When asked whether there is a possibility of reaching a compromise between China and Japan if the anti-communist issue is not discussed, the answer was that this is a secret and the most secret part of the Sino-Japanese negotiations.

<p>(Rome) Regarding Italy's de facto recognition of "Manchukuo" and Japan's de facto recognition of the Italian Empire, after responsible officials here revealed the news last Saturday, informed sources recently announced that the Italian and Japanese governments have decided to issue communiqués separately today and in the middle of next week. The communiqué has been drafted after exchanging views between the Prime Minister's Office and the Japanese Embassy. What should be released today is the announcement that Japan has established a consulate general in Addis Ababa, and what should be released next week is the announcement that Italy has established a consulate general in Changchun, the capital of "Manchukuo". Regarding this level, political people believe that this method can avoid the objections of the United Kingdom and the United States, and can also satisfy the pragmatic tendencies of the Italian and Japanese diplomatic authorities, regardless of how the legal essence is. As for the reason why the two sides issued communiqués separately, it was to prevent the outside world from interpreting them as exchange conditions. In addition, since Japan's interests in East Africa are very important, the agreement reached between Japan and Italy this time is also commercially important. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3 id="e62">After the Establishment of the German-Japanese Pact, Japanese Prime Minister Hirota Considers New Diplomatic Policies, Pays Attention to the Reactions of Related Countries, and Sino-Japanese Negotiations Are Expected to Resume Within the Year. Japan's Attitude Towards Russia on the Fisheries Issue is Tough. <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Hirota has overcome the difficulties in preparing next year's budget and has signed the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact. He is preparing to deal with the next session of the Diet and implement unresolved policies. It is reported that the policies of Prime Minister's considered foreign policy plan are as follows:</p>
<p>In the future, foreign national policies should pay attention to the impact of the Japanese-German Pact on countries with direct interests such as China, Russia, Britain, and the United States, and strive to explain the new spirit of the Pact to various countries. In particular, since there is a fisheries treaty between Japan and Russia to be signed, the best efforts should be made to eliminate Soviet suspicion, with a view to signing a fisheries treaty within the year. Sino-Japanese negotiations have been temporarily suspended due to the war in Suiyuan, but negotiations are expected to resume before the end of the year. (Domei dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet-Japanese fisheries treaty, which was scheduled to be signed on the 20th, was suddenly postponed due to the Soviet Union's excuse that domestic procedures had not been completed, resulting in a standstill at present. The agricultural and forestry authorities supervising the Northern Ocean fisheries believe that the Soviet Union's disregard for international credibility and the trampling of Japan's Northern Ocean rights acquired under the Treaty of Portsmouth is unfounded, but the Soviet Union still refuses to negotiate. Therefore, the attitude of the agricultural and forestry authorities is very tough. If it is not signed by the end of this month when the treaty expires, decisive measures will be taken to maintain vested rights. If, unfortunately, the fishing season next year comes in a state without a treaty, a policy of decisively allowing those involved to fish freely has already been established. The opinions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Navy, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry have also been aligned. Therefore, if it is not signed, free fishing has already been decided. Therefore, the future measures of the Soviet Union are quite noteworthy. (Domei dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3 id="e65">League of Nations Executive Council to Convene Special Meeting to Discuss the Spanish Situation; Meeting Date Pending Decision <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>(London) The League of Nations Executive Council has convened a special meeting at the request of the Spanish government. The date will be determined after replies from all member states of the council are received tomorrow. This action by Spain is based on Article 11, Section 2 of the League of Nations covenant, which states: "Any circumstance whatever affecting international relations which threatens to disturb international peace or the good understanding between nations upon which peace depends can be brought to the attention of the Assembly or of the Council by any Member of the League." As for the two proposed meeting dates of December 7th and 14th suggested by the League Secretariat, the majority favors the 7th. However, the Chilean government has expressed its support for convening the meeting on the 14th. It is heard that, excluding opinions from countries like the Swiss Confederation and Chile, most council members believe that discussing the Spanish situation now might not be effective. In the Spanish government's request to the League of Nations Executive Council for a special meeting, it strongly criticized Italy and Germany for supporting the rebel forces and interfering in the country's civil war, stating that their actions violate international law. The recent recognition of the Nationalist government is, in effect, an act of aggression against the Spanish government. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(Rome) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol's proposal to convene a League of Nations Executive Council meeting to discuss the overall situation in Spain raises the possibility of Italy withdrawing from the League. According to non-official observers here, if this happens, it will trigger a serious and dangerous situation for Italy. People here believe that the Italian and German governments' recognition of General Franco's government in Spain is entirely within their rights. If the League of Nations conference accuses Italy, Italy will not tolerate it. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is now reported that the government has decided that Italy should continue to be a member of the League of Nations, but with one limitation: if the country is criticized again in Geneva, it will immediately withdraw from the League without hesitation. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Spanish government's request to convene the League of Nations Executive Council, Italians here recently declared that since the Valencia government is not the officially recognized government by Italy, if the League of Nations Executive Council discusses the complaints raised by such a government, Italy will refuse to send representatives to attend. However, Italy has no intention of withdrawing from the League of Nations. Italian Ambassador Grandi has never warned the British Foreign Office that discussing the Spanish civil war issue in the League of Nations would cause the most serious consequences; he has only criticized the act of convening the Executive Council. Furthermore, since the Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish civil war is currently discussing the non-intervention issue and there is no risk of causing danger, convening the Executive Council at this time is not only useless but also harmful. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It was learned today that the League of Nations Executive Council will likely meet on December 7th, at which time the Spanish government will request the League to intervene in the country's civil war. However, depending on the opinions of Britain and France, the League seems likely to reject the Spanish government's request, as Britain believes that this civil war is purely an internal affair. France also argues that the League should not investigate and should not intervene. The Non-Intervention Committee already has powers equivalent to the League of Nations to prevent other countries from openly assisting either side. Currently, it seems that only the Soviet Union supports a League of Nations investigation, while Germany and Italy naturally oppose it. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>

<p>(London) The Liberal Party's official newspaper, the "News Chronicle," recently published a dispatch from a correspondent in Tangier, the international neutral port in North Africa, stating that Italian nationals in the port are becoming increasingly arrogant. Italian officials are doing everything they can to support the Spanish Nationalist forces. Even sailors from Italian warships docked in the port frequently come ashore, parade through the streets, and loudly sing Fascist songs, displaying great arrogance. The local Spanish and French communities view this with disapproval. The correspondent also stated that General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, had previously promised the natives of Spanish Morocco autonomous rights in exchange for their involvement in the civil war within Morocco.</p>

<p>Talavera (Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent) This morning, the Nationalist forces launched a general offensive against the city of Madrid, covered by artillery and aircraft. The most intense attacks occurred in the northwest and south. Twenty-seven Nationalist aircraft flew over Madrid, bombing the city from low altitude. Currently, the fighting is extremely fierce in the area around the Rosales Avenue and the "De Tettuan" Barracks (southwest suburbs of Madrid). The outcome is still unknown. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Madrid The weather in Madrid cleared up this morning, and residents feared that the Nationalist forces would resume heavy shelling. However, the government air force took the initiative, slightly reassuring the people. The government air force initially circled over the city before heading directly towards the enemy lines. Attacks by Moorish cavalry in the northwest district and near University City this morning were repelled by militiamen. The militiamen claim that the Nationalist forces suffered heavy casualties. Exciting news also arrived from other government army fronts. Government forces also launched offensives at several locations, greatly threatening the flanks of the Nationalist forces. Today, the government forces used "rocket propaganda" for the first time. These rockets were invented by a clever fireworks manufacturer in Valencia and are used to fire into Nationalist outposts. Upon landing and exploding, they release leaflets written in Spanish and Arabic, specifically targeted at foreign mercenary soldiers and Moorish soldiers, detailing the crimes and ambitions of Nationalist generals. (Reuters, 29th) The situation of unrest among the natives in Morocco is becoming increasingly serious. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>Valencia Today, the Spanish government issued a statement saying that the Nationalist forces' claim of victory west of the capital is false. The militiamen are counterattacking in that area and have advanced several miles. Government forces have also won battles in the province of Sanahuja, occupying several villages. It is reported that the enemy forces suffered heavy casualties. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Madrid The National Defense Council announced at noon today that rebel forces, using tank formations as cover, launched a fierce attack on the village of Pozuelo, west of Madrid. Government troops stood up to resist and engaged in hand-to-hand combat, eventually repelling the attack. The rebel forces suffered significant losses. On other fronts, artillery units from both sides continue to exchange fire. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>Talavera A government army detachment is now threatening the right flank and transportation lines of the rebel forces. As a result, the rebel forces besieging Madrid have shifted their main attack from the east of the capital to the west. Yesterday, rebel forces were very active west of the capital, occupying the village of Boadilla, eight miles from Madrid, and then advancing four miles from there towards Majadahonda. Government forces have retreated north to Alarcón. It is reported that, in addition to two hundred captured, there were four hundred casualties. The rebels are apparently attempting to cut off the Escorial highway and threaten the government army's communication lines in the Guadarrama Mountains. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Talavera (Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent) Yesterday morning, the Nationalist forces continued to fight in the northwest of Madrid, advancing four kilometers towards the village of Majadahonda (twelve kilometers northwest of Madrid). They also occupied the Villa Vistillas Sanatorium. In the afternoon, they continued their offensive and occupied several more high grounds, enabling them to control the village of Húmera. From then on, government forces in the Casa de Campo park area can be cleared out, thereby cutting off Madrid's communication with the city of El Escorial to the northwest, and the Nationalist forces can completely besiege the city of Madrid.

<p>(London) British Member of Parliament Captain McNamee, a Conservative, informed a Reuters reporter via long-distance telephone last night that he and three other British MPs were nearly hit by shells while inspecting the front line, and he was fortunate to survive. While he was on the phone, the sound of artillery fire in the air was deafening. McNamee said that the food situation in the capital is appalling. Meat is unavailable, and the only dishes served in hotels are vegetables and grains. Residents waiting to buy cauliflower often have to wait for ten hours before they can get it, and it costs as much as four shillings. The platforms of underground stations are filled with refugees, and the outbreak of epidemics is likely to be very serious. One-third of the city has been reduced to rubble. (Reuters, 30th)</p>

<p>Gibraltar A British journalist, who arrived in Gibraltar today from Madrid, stated that since the beginning of the war, approximately several thousand people in Madrid have been executed by firing squad. Most of them were executed without trial by the defending forces, and their number is actually more than those killed by Nationalist artillery. Food in the city is extremely scarce, and refugees only want one meal of rations per day. He also said that the government's reports on the Nationalist shelling of the capital are often exaggerated. Shells often land near military targets, and the Nationalist forces apparently do not want to destroy the entire city. However, since government forces have stationed themselves in churches and schools, the Nationalist forces have had to shell them. The high-rise building where the telephone company is located is the most prominent artillery target in Madrid, but the Nationalist forces have not yet fired a single shell at it. (Reuters, 30th)</p>

<p>Madrid Our correspondent visited the surrounding areas of the capital to inspect the battle situation and learned that the morale of the government forces is still very high. Today's fighting was most intense in the area behind the Casa de Campo park in the northwest suburbs. Nationalist forces attempted to break through the government forces' lines using tanks as cover, but they were defeated after the government forces put up a valiant resistance. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) The government forces' offensives in Oviedo and Talavera, south of Madrid, show that the government forces' strength has greatly improved. It can also indicate that the government forces have obtained a lot of foreign-supplied military equipment. A very well-informed source said that if the countries supplying the government forces were revealed to the world, everyone would be surprised. Moreover, the tactics of this counter-offensive are much more carefully planned than before, with the aim of reducing the enemy's pressure on the capital. A neutral observer predicts that government forces will continue their offensive or will attack Huesca, and it is not impossible to turn the tide and gain the upper hand. Important developments are expected within a few weeks. At the same time, General Franco's offensive on Madrid has completely stalled, apparently due to a lack of troops. Associated Press reporter Miller is convinced that if the government forces can cut off Oviedo's transportation, General Mola will have to transfer troops from other locations to break through the government forces surrounding Oviedo. As for the residents of the city, they will suffer greatly, as Miller found that residents were already on the verge of starvation when he visited the area a month ago, and transportation has not yet been restored.

The government issued a public statement tonight declaring that the rebel aircraft dropped a total of two hundred bombs, causing significant losses. President Azaña arrived here yesterday and discussed the situation in Madrid with Prime Minister Caballero, and also listened to Foreign Minister Álvarez del Vayo report on the impact of the civil war abroad.

One detachment occupied the village of Húmera, while the other occupied the village of Pozuelo. However, near Madrid, Nationalist aircraft were unable to operate due to bad weather. There were no significant battles in the three areas of Biscay Province in the northwest, Aragon Province in the northeast, and Andalusia Province in the south.

<p>Évreux, France Defense Minister Daladier recently gave a speech at a banquet of the local Radical Socialist Party branch, referring to the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany and Japan, saying, "We now hear the strained voices from Asia. A nation in Asia now wants to take on the responsibility of defending Western culture. But we must tell all nations that the arms race is tantamount to mad suicide, because if another world war breaks out, human culture will be lost. We now wish to extend our hands of sincerity and friendship to all nations to help each other, but they should know that our hands are by no means weak and lifeless hands. Our country must be strong both materially and spiritually. Once France is weakened, the world will lose its peace, and our French people will also lose their freedom. Our French army is disciplined and strong. We are thorough pacifists, but we will never beg for peace." He then spoke about domestic affairs in France, saying, "Disturbing order, inciting public opinion, and empty rhetoric are all enemies of the republican system and democracy. It must be known that the order of a new society must be based on the internal peace of the French people. After the failure of the Social Democratic Republic in Germany, Hitler rose to power. After the collapse of democracy in Italy, Mussolini came to power. You should not have forgotten that. Domestic peace is a necessary condition for social progress, but there are other, more urgent conditions, and that is international peace. Today, swords are hanging all over the peace tree, and even in the olive groves, the glint of swords can be seen everywhere." (Note: Olive branches are a symbol of peace.) "I did not have this feeling at first, but the dictators of other countries have already said it many times. Our era is one where scientific developments are changing rapidly, and natural resources are abundant and inexhaustible. Therefore, the main issue we need to solve now is only the distribution of assets. We must now devote all our intelligence and strength to solving this problem, rather than engaging in futile struggles." (Havas, 29th)</p>

Many floodlights were placed outside the palace gates, illuminating the scene as if it were daytime, while the inside of the palace was filled with candles, adding to the brilliance. Yesterday was the first day of Admiral Horthy's visit, and political figures here believe that Horthy's trip, rather than containing significant political implications, is more about demonstrating the friendship between Austria and Hungary.

<h3 id="e85">Peiping: A Sideline Account of Aid to Suiyuan; Aid Suiyuan Associations and Student Fundraising <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Throughout Peiping, counting all levels of schools from universities to elementary schools, along with other special schools, there are over ten thousand young students. In the past, these student groups have always been the vanguard of various movements. This holds true in the current Aid Suiyuan Movement. Since the official outbreak of the Suiyuan War, half a month has passed, and student groups have been rallying and calling for aid to Suiyuan for over ten days. Relying on their patriotic fervor and youthful courage, they have spared no effort in promoting the Aid Suiyuan Movement, as evidenced by hunger strikes and class boycotts, among other measures. Over the past ten days, the response from various sectors has generally been positive. However, in terms of actively rising up, spontaneously organizing groups, and joining forces with student groups to support the Aid Suiyuan Movement, as of now, the only participants have been the faculty and staff of cultural institutions and schools at various levels, along with a small number of women's groups. As such, organizations like the "All-Circles Aid Suiyuan Association," despite repeated calls from student groups, have remained in the preparatory stage and have not been formally established. This is partly due to the unique circumstances of Peiping, where people from all walks of life are more concerned about their personal and family assets than students. However, on the other hand, it can be reasoned that if the "skin is gone, where will the hair attach?" The Suiyuan War is a major turning point for the survival of the nation, a self-evident principle. According to general observations, people in various circles here still do not fully understand this principle, which is inferior to major southern cities. Currently, the main force behind the Aid Suiyuan Movement here is still supported solely by student groups. However, in reality, due to the limitations imposed by the authorities, schoolwork, and their own strength, it is a question worth noting how long this support can last. The biggest determining factor depends on the extent of the assistance provided to them by various circles, that is, whether organizations like the "All-Circles Aid Suiyuan Association" can be practically expanded and established.</p>
<p>Regarding all the expressions of students in this Aid Suiyuan Movement, there is much sympathy and support from all walks of life. However, regarding the matter of fundraising, there are several points that have aroused concerns from various parties. The former includes the so-called "five evils" of the Hebei-Chahar authorities, and the latter includes the Public Security Bureau's precautions against petty criminals posing as fundraisers, all of which are the most prominent. In addition, (1) the concern of all circles that they will be solicited for donations repeatedly without end; (2) the fear that the control and preservation of donations will not be in the hands of reliable people; (3) the inevitable confusion, duplication, and unnecessary phenomena in purchasing and sending goods to the front lines. This type of concern has more well-intentioned components and cannot be compared with fundamental distrust. Now, student groups have been able to observe these places and make corrections one by one. Once the facts are demonstrated, everything should not be a problem.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Class Boycotts and Symposiums <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Since the launch of the Aid Suiyuan Movement, there have been two class boycotts in schools here. The first time, schools acted individually, without prior communication or subsequent notification. Therefore, in terms of order, there were differences in timing, and in terms of period, there were variations in length. Some lasted up to five days, while others lasted only half a day. The activities during the class boycotts also varied. The second class boycott was jointly decided by representatives from various schools. Except for a few schools that were unable to participate due to special difficulties or because the first class boycott lasted too long, the total number of schools participating in the second class boycott reached more than 20. The duration of this class boycott was uniformly two days, from the 25th to the 26th.</p>
<p>After representatives from various schools jointly decided on the class boycott, this resolution was separately approved by the entire student body of each school. During the two-day class boycott on the 25th and 26th, order was exceptionally good in each school. All work during the class boycott was entirely the responsibility of temporary organizations such as the "Working Committee During the Class Boycott." In addition to holding physical education inspections and smoke screen demonstrations, the most meaningful activity was the holding of symposiums.</p>
<p>During the class boycott, symposiums were held separately by each school on campus, and jointly expanded symposiums were held by various schools. The former were held on the 25th, and the situation in each school was exceptionally good. The topics of discussion were largely similar, such as "The Understanding and Our Tasks in the Suiyuan War of Resistance." School authorities and teachers participated in the speeches, with calm and enthusiastic attitudes, and tense but not impetuous emotions. These were the common points of each school. As for the results of their discussions, according to investigations conducted by reporters in various places, they were also largely consistent. In short, (1) the Suiyuan War is a key to the survival of the entire nation of China; (2) the ultimate goal of the Chinese people is to seek the freedom and equality of the entire nation, so we should do our best to support the current Suiyuan War. The expanded symposium jointly held by various schools on the 26th was held in three locations in the city, and the participants were very enthusiastic, and the order was also good. Professors from various schools were invited to give speeches, and the topic was "The Future of the Suiyuan War of Resistance." The opinions resulting from the discussions in the three locations were also relatively simple and consistent, that is, if our country can rise up and fight together, then the future should be able to achieve the thorough liberation of the nation.</p>
<p>The holding of this class boycott and symposium, not only the teachers and students of each school, but also the authorities took a tacit attitude and did not interfere, because with the support of national public opinion, there is no need to interfere as long as it does not go out of line, and there is no possibility of interference. As for the authorities of one or two schools, who have issued notices to admonish students, to obey the government, to unify steps, and not to disrupt the rear and distract the attention of the soldiers in front, they have been preventing students from acting excessively and preparing early. In fact, under the current situation, the goals are very simple, and there are probably no divergent or excessive actions. The actions of the authorities of a certain school are actually overconcerned. Indeed, after the two-day class boycott, all schools resumed classes on the 27th. This is a clear proof in fact.</p>
<h3 id="e87">War Service Corps <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>During this Suiyuan War, young students in Peiping, as in the past, were motivated by righteousness and joined the army in droves, attempting to participate in the war on the ground. Except for the seven young students from the four northeastern provinces who went there the other day, no others have been seen. Modern warfare is a complex matter that cannot be achieved with mere enthusiasm. Without long-term training, it may be a disservice. The "January 28th Incident" in Shanghai is a lesson from the past. Young students here seem to be fully aware of this. Furthermore, so-called combat requires the cooperation of both the front and rear to be called war. Recently, General Fu Zuoyi also earnestly stated this at a banquet for representatives from all walks of life. Therefore, most of the student work in Peiping this time seeks practicality. As for the "War Zone Service Corps" currently being organized, it is only a group organized after carefully examining the needs of the front line, which is very different from the purely righteous groups of the past. Therefore, the work they plan to do only includes the following items: (1) Rescue work; (2) Entertainment propaganda and condolence work; (3) Transportation and liaison work; (4) Various common technical work, such as radio, etc. Since the beginning of the preparation of this "War Zone Service Corps," many students from various schools have enthusiastically registered. If all the difficult problems can be solved smoothly, then the date of departure should not be far away.</p>

<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: According to a visitor from Wuzhou, a major assassination occurred in Wuzhou on the 21st of this month at 11:00 PM. The incident took place at the rear residence of a certain address on Datong Middle Street, Datong Road, Wuzhou. A man was suddenly assassinated. The man was Wang Yaqiao, who recently fled to Guangxi Province, from another province. It is said that he once held a military position in a certain army. That evening, Wang was dining at a friend's residence when he was suddenly assassinated at 11:00 PM. Wang died on the spot, with three gunshot wounds and two stab wounds. After the incident, police detectives rushed to the scene to investigate, but the assailants had fled without a trace. The person who invited the deceased to dinner was also nowhere to be found. It is reported that the woman living in the residence brought her three children from Hong Kong on the 4th of this month (lunar calendar) and was currently residing at a certain address, which was also found by the deceased. The deceased and the woman were clearly acquainted. However, after the incident, the woman left behind her three children and Hong Kong currency and belongings, without taking any of them, and disappeared. At the time, neighbors heard five or six gunshots. After the police arrived at the scene, they learned that a major murder had occurred. Since the occurrence of this case, the entire Wuzhou police force has imposed a special curfew that night, cutting off traffic until dawn, but the assailants were not found. The mistress of the residence fled without a trace, and was obviously related to the case. The deceased was stabbed twice with a sword, which was still stuck in the body, it is said.</p>
<p>According to another message, an assassination occurred downstairs at a certain residence on Datong Road, Wuzhou. The murdered man was a man in his forties, shot three times, in a very tragic state. At the time, the police on duty nearby suddenly heard gunshots and rushed back to report to the branch office in charge. After investigating the residence, they learned that the deceased's name was Ren Shuren. A woman in her thirties had rented the house before the incident. After the incident, the woman had fled without a trace, apparently related to the case. It is said that there were three or four assailants. According to the landlord, the woman had just arrived from Hong Kong and had only moved in three days before the incident occurred. Wuzhou authorities considered this case serious and seemed to involve political revenge, and are investigating it strictly.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Guangdong Province Actively Purchases Silver; Provincial Bank Continuously Increases Issuance of Silver Yuan Notes; Simultaneously Uses Legal Tender as Reserve Fund <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: To meet the need for supply and accelerate the purchase of silver as much as possible, the Guangdong Provincial Bank has been continuously issuing the silver yuan notes of the Provincial Bank that have been printed but not yet issued in recent days. It was verified that 2 million yuan worth of one-yuan silver yuan notes were signed and issued on the 25th. On the 26th, five-yuan and ten-yuan silver yuan notes that were printed and stored were continuously issued, but the amount was not announced. It is reported that the reserve fund for this issuance is 40% in bonds of the bank and 60% in national currency obtained from the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. The first batch of 15 million yuan of national currency and the second batch of 10 million yuan will also be transported. The Provincial Bank will use the obtained national currency to exchange for Provincial silver yuan notes from the Guangzhou Branch of the Reserve Fund Management Committee at full value, and use the national currency to offset the Provincial bed reserve. Yesterday, the Provincial Bank officially announced the issuance of new silver yuan notes, stating that the bank's stock of Provincial notes was very small, and that people have been flocking to the bank and its branches to sell silver. Without issuing new notes, it would be difficult to cope. Therefore, the legal tender was sent to the Guangzhou Branch of the Reserve Fund Management Committee for verification and collection, and new Provincial notes printed by the US banknotes company were exchanged, which were still signed by Chairman Song (Ziliang) of the branch and President Gu Yiqun and Deputy President Yun Zhaokun. Before Chairman Song signed, the president and deputy president first signed 2 million yuan of two-yuan notes for the need to purchase silver. If a certain amount of silver is purchased, then a certain amount of new notes will be issued according to a two-to-one ratio, in order to complete the purchase of silver as soon as possible, and to ensure the Provincial note reserve. The Provincial Bank issued another announcement on the 27th, stating that the number of people selling silver has continued to increase in recent days, and the previous amount of notes has been exhausted. It is necessary to continue signing and issuing notes to meet the needs. The ten-yuan and five-yuan notes will be jointly signed by Chairman Song of the Guangzhou Branch of the Reserve Fund Management Committee and the President and Deputy President of the bank, and will be issued from the 27th of this month. The bank hereby informs all sectors that all taxes and market transactions will be conducted in the same manner as the Provincial notes signed by former President Shen. According to the bank's estimate, the total amount of currency needed in the province is tens of millions of yuan. Previously, the bank issued a total of 24,108,000 yuan of silver yuan notes, and the bank's cash reserve totaled 12,462,000 yuan. In the future, while increasing the issuance of silver yuan notes, it will also increase the reserve fund to avoid the abuses of excessive issuance.</p>

<p>Shen Rongchu, a 56-year-old resident of the 2nd neighborhood, 2nd district of the northern city of this county, was attacked at noon on the 26th of this month by his cousin, Liu Chu (51 years old), along with his son Zuyin, nephew Hongnian, and more than ten others. They claimed to want to reclaim the documents and re-divide the family property. Shen's younger brother was also imprisoned. When Shen's father passed away, the family property was divided into three shares, and documents were established at that time. However, Liu Chu's share had already been spent. Therefore, he recently had a whimsical idea, claiming that it was his aunt's intention to request a re-division. Shen Rongchu and others refused, and a dispute arose. It is now heard that Shen Rongchu has decided to hire a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit against his brother for his actions.</p>

<p>The Wuxian County Government has been ordered to collect land tax. The first installment of 40% was commenced earlier, and the second installment of 60% is scheduled to commence today (1st) for a period of two months. A late payment fine of 3% will be added for overdue payments. The county government believes that this year's rice harvest is abundant, so there is no reduction in this year's land tax, and the full amount will be collected. However, various landowners and shopkeepers argue that although the autumn harvest is abundant, some villages, such as Weiting, are still barren. Therefore, they are still striving to request a reduction of 10% to show compassion, but it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve their goal. As for this year's rent, although there has been a slight improvement in recent days, the amount collected is only a little over 10%. The county government is currently devising methods to urge collection.</p>

<p>A major theft case occurred at Dafeng Silver Furnace in Lüyuan Nei months ago, with stolen gold bars and silver ornaments worth approximately 100,000 yuan. Shareholders of the shop, with acting manager Ji Yushu and bookkeeper Xia Buzhou, suspected of embezzlement, sued the court. The court has already sentenced Ji Yushu and Xia Buzhou to criminal penalties, and the case is now on appeal. A few days ago, there was a new development in the case. Ji Yushu reported to the detective team that Xia Likuan, the instigator of the case, had been captured. There were also two perpetrators, Bai and others, hiding in Shanghai. The detective team sent officers to Shanghai to arrest them, but they were not found. The detective team escorted Xia Likuan to the Public Security Bureau on the 30th for detention and interrogation. However, this case is of great importance, and Director Zhang paid close attention to whether there was a background. On the one hand, he is arresting Bai and others to investigate the case.</p>

<p>Recently, the grain transported by the railway station of this county to the Jinpu and Longhai Railways is stacked in the open air, in addition to the existing warehouses are full, due to the lack of vehicles. Although the Ministry of Railways has repeatedly dispatched vehicles to Wuxi, they are still insufficient for loading and transportation. At present, most merchants have contacted the Shanghai Steamship Bureau to load the goods from the interior to Shanghai, and then transport them from Shanghai to Yantai, and then transfer them to the Longhai Railway. However, the date of arrival is three or four days later than by train. I sincerely hope that the authorities will pay attention to it in order to maintain the people's livelihood.</p>

<p>The Director of Instruction of Mingfeng Elementary School, Zhu Menglian, was suspended from her position by the Education Bureau. The students went to the Education Bureau to petition for her reinstatement, but to no avail, which led to a disturbance in which the students expelled the principal, Hao Shuying, and the new Director of Instruction, Zhang Fang blank. At the same time, the Education Bureau, based on Principal Hao's report that the disturbance was instigated by Zhu Menglian and teachers Wei Anshi and Shen Huaizhu, and that students had held meetings at Zhu Menglian's home beforehand, reported the situation to the County Government and arrested Zhu Menglian and others that night. A notice was posted, stating that the school would be temporarily suspended for reorganization before reopening. Yesterday morning, the students of the school went to school, but seeing that the school gate was closed, they gathered again and went to the Education Bureau to petition for classes. Upon hearing the report, the County Government, in order to thoroughly investigate the facts of the disturbance, personally led the bailiffs to the Education Bureau and selected the five oldest students who came to petition, Zhou Deyuan, Zheng Zengxiang, Zhou Fulong, Liu Zhaoxing, and Liu Yongkang, and brought them to the County Government along with Zhu Menglian and others blank and handed them over to the judiciary for handling.

<p>He Yufa, an old farmer from Heshai, Younan, who had some savings, was coveted by bandits.

His daughter-in-law, Ms. Ma, in her early twenties, was brave by nature. Seeing her father-in-law being coerced by the robbers, she disregarded her own safety and stepped forward to seize the bandit's pistol. Yufa was able to take the opportunity to escape. However, Ms. Ma was stabbed five times in the back of her hand with a knife by another bandit while fighting with the bandit for the pistol. She could not bear the pain and released her hand. Because Yufa went out, fearing that the police would be called, the bandits fled together, so the loss was still small.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Yarn Flowers: Current Yarn Heading to Sichuan, Futures Market Sees Sudden Surge in Buying, Batch Closings Have No Impact <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is soaring, with a fierce momentum fueled by brisk sales, a shortage of current yarn at factories, and eager buying from customers unable to find goods to meet their demands. This has stirred excitement, leading to a buying frenzy and a sharp rise in market prices. However, some industry players are closing out batches, and Indian merchants are also seen selling, but this has been unable to halt the upward trend. In reality, this is still due to the robust spot market business, but the price increases have not been too drastic.</p>
<p>Recently, yarn prices have risen by more than five yuan. At the opening of the futures market, all months experienced a uniform surge, displaying immense momentum. This was primarily due to Sichuan merchants purchasing one to two thousand bales of current yarn the previous afternoon. Furthermore, it was reported that 1,000 bales of 20-count Jincheng Double Deer yarn from the Yong'an factory, scheduled for delivery in November, were entirely bought up by Sichuan merchants. This news shook the market, causing the December futures to jump three yuan, and the distant months to rise by one to two yuan. News spread quickly that yarn sales were brisk, and the eagerness to acquire spot yarn in the market was particularly strong. As factories struggled to supply current yarn, the market continued its upward trajectory. Consequently, all months saw a price increase ranging from 3.40 to 4.80 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. At the afternoon opening, it was reported that spot yarn trading had improved, and market sentiment remained positive. However, major players sold off batches, which slightly calmed the market. As a result, prices for all months rose by an additional 0.30 to 0.80 yuan compared to the morning's closing price. Senkang and Runkang engaged in buying in the morning and selling in the afternoon. It was observed that they sold 3,250 bales of Hengyi, 1,250 bales of Dafeng, 1,950 bales of Yiji, 1,850 bales of Yuanda, 9,800 bales of Jinchang, 3,100 bales of Mingde, 4,600 bales of Feng, 1,150 bales of Ruida, 1,800 bales of Fengtai, 3,950 bales of Renfeng, 1,500 bales of Taichang, 12,100 bales of Changfeng, 1,000 bales of Zhenda, 1,650 bales of Dachang, and 1,850 bales of Yongda.

<h3 id="e103">Ample Inventory and Loose Prices at Production Areas: Cotton Futures Lack the Strength of Yarn Futures <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is stable, and market conditions are not as strong as those of the yarn market. This is due to ample cotton inventory and loose prices in various producing regions, which has dampened market sentiment. There is a lack of enthusiasm among those looking to buy, but some are slightly pulling in due to the large difference between cotton and yarn prices.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Rises Slightly Due to Short Covering: At the opening of the spot cotton market, prices rose slightly due to the overseas cotton market rising and the strength of the yarn market. However, market sentiment was weary and uninspired, and prices for each month were uneven. After the opening, prices rose as short sellers eagerly covered their positions due to the soaring yarn prices. As a result, prices for all months rose by 1.2 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. At the afternoon opening, market conditions were slightly higher, driven by the yarn market. Consequently, prices for each month rose or fell by 0.05 to 0.1 jiao compared to the morning's closing price. It was observed that Mingde sold 14,000 dan, Xinchang 5,400 dan, Hengyi 4,800 dan, Yuda 4,300 dan, Jinchang 4,500 dan, Gengfeng 5,800 dan, Changji 2,200 dan, Ruida 2,400 dan, Dachangcheng 5,300 dan, Yichang 4,100 dan, and Shengyuan 5,600 dan.

<p>Over the past week, although a major exporter sold off large quantities of Gor and Oomra cotton, market prices remained firm. At low prices, short covering and purchases by Japanese merchants led to a surge in domestic activity, and market prices were able to hold steady. According to reports, except for a few cotton-growing areas, arrivals in various markets have been surging. In the spot market, the demand from Japanese exporters for Ping Gor and Oomra cotton remains strong. Local factories have shown slight activity.

<h3 id="e105">Piece Goods: Strong Demand from Cloth Merchants, Prices in Various Regions Gradually Approaching Shanghai Market, Scarcity of Spot Goods Prevents Sales from Expanding <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was characterized by firm and active market conditions. The supply of goods was strong, and the shortage continued to worsen. Consequently, market sentiment was steady, and sales prices in various regions were also rebounding rapidly due to brisk sales. Compared to the Shanghai market, prices were already in line. Therefore, the eagerness to purchase increased, leading to fierce competition for spot goods. As a result, spot goods in the market became even scarcer. Furthermore, with the recent surge of five yuan in near-month cotton yarn prices, and the shortage and high prices of spot yarn, the prices of various colors and types of plain cloth rose uniformly. White cloth from Chinese factories and British Jardine Matheson factories increased by 1.2 jiao per piece. Eastern fine cloth, fine twill, grey cloth, and coarse cloth increased by 0.05 to 0.1 jiao per piece. Local fine twill increased by 0.1 to 0.15 jiao per piece. Blue cloth and bleached cloth increased by 0.1 jiao. Serge, Zhigong, line fabrics, and printed fabrics all increased by 0.0025 to 0.005 yuan per yard. Velvet goods, white twill velvet, and striped velvet were in high demand and selling quickly. Spot goods were in urgent need, and occasionally sold for an additional 0.2 yuan per piece. Sales of colored cloth were also gradually improving. Yesterday, Sichuan merchants absorbed over 200 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, Zhigong, and line fabrics, while inland merchants absorbed over 400 pieces of various types of coarse cloth, which was a relatively large amount. Due to the scarcity of spot goods, the transaction volume remained difficult to increase.</p>

<p>The favorable conditions of the woolen market were detailed in previous reports. Unexpectedly, the price of yellow camel wool suddenly declined yesterday. Double-faced yellow camel wool has been popular recently, with many men's and women's overcoats using it. It is also used for linings. Therefore, last winter, supply could not meet demand, and prices soared, allowing distributors to profit greatly. However, this year, arrivals have doubled, and there are many Japanese goods. Many woolen businesses have been distributing it, but sales have been slow, and prices have fallen. Yesterday, ordinary first-grade thick yellow camel wool was reduced by 4.4 yuan per batch, and slightly thinner second-grade wool was reduced by 3.75 yuan per batch.</p>

After entering the market, the silver balancing tax was announced to be up by 0.025 yuan. Banks bought and sold unevenly. Japanese banks showed some buying interest, and the situation hovered. Banks gradually became suppliers, but Chinese merchants turned around and bought, making it difficult for the market to ease. Later, Japanese banks sold Donghui and foreign banks sold shillings, while Chinese merchants continued to buy, creating a struggle. By closing, the selling price for near-term transactions was 1 shilling 2.5625 pence for British currency and 29.6875 and 0.75 yuan in tandem for U.S. currency, which was unchanged compared to the previous closing price.

<p>Yesterday, the public bond market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange experienced a significant change. A sharp decline began again, as the environmental situation was more serious. However, market sentiment was calm due to the firmness of the table. Unexpectedly, after the market opened, long buyers continued to emerge, and the retail market sentiment became weak, with many selling off. The supply of chips was extremely high, and the market price uniformly and sharply declined. Looking at the bond market going forward, the conflict between long and short positions has become intense, and there may be unexpected fluctuations in the future. Yesterday's process: At the morning opening, large players sold off and emerged in large numbers. Issues 4, 37, 35, and 23, among others, had huge sales, while issues 10, 50, and 3 saw a lot of buying. Market prices fell uniformly by 0.5 to 0.75 yuan. In the second round, market sentiment was also weak, and the downward trend continued. Large players such as issues 54, 5, and 35 all had printed sales, and Tongmao started to fall by 0.05 to 0.3 yuan. However, issues 22, 3, and 10 saw strong buying, and Tongjia futures even rebounded by 0.1 yuan. At the afternoon opening, market conditions were even weaker. Large players such as issues 35, 11, and 54 continued to sell off large quantities, while issues 10, 5, and 4 saw strong buying interest. Market prices fell again by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Tongjia next month's issue 35 was sold off, plummeting 0.7 yuan. At the close, the downward trend became fierce again. Issues 35, 11, 45, 10, and 53 continued to supply extremely high chips, while issues 22, 4, and retail investors gradually covered shorts or sold. Tongwu, Tongjia, and others continued to fall slightly by 0.1-0.2 to 0.5 yuan. The full-day results uniformly showed a sharp drop of 1.05 to 1.4 yuan, while 96 was down slightly by 0.25 yuan. The total transaction volume was 14.45 million yuan. A comparison of the price increases, decreases, highs, and lows is listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3 id="e110">Grains: Flour Delivery Settled Privately <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Since the flour delivery was changed from the exchange to the public warehouse, the procedures have become more complicated. Therefore, before the end of the month, both parties settled privately, so there was no official delivery. As for the flour trend, November was relatively calm, and there was no significant change in prices. However, looking ahead, prices may gradually rise again. This is because there are fewer wheat arrivals, and Shaanxi merchants are restocking, so wheat shipments from the north are bound to decrease. Furthermore, the only hope, foreign wheat, is also gradually rising. Yesterday's prices reported that Chicago was up 0.4-0.5 yuan, Canada was up 0.2-0.3 yuan, and Liverpool was up 0.1375 yuan. All of these factors seem to favor long positions, and the background is inevitably related to military affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Wheat Delivery 38 Cars <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's miscellaneous grain delivery was still lively. The total number of wheat deliveries was 38 cars, including 6 cars of No. 2, 4 cars of No. 8, 2 cars of No. 10, 3 cars of No. 16, 8 cars of No. 15, 9 cars of No. 23, 4 cars of No. 27, and 2 cars of No. 36. The deliveries were exclusively received by No. 12. Sesame deliveries totaled 8 tickets, with 8 tickets delivered by No. 45, 5 tickets received by No. 10, and 3 tickets received by No. 25. Standard soybean oil totaled 1,300 dan, with 900 dan delivered by No. 15 and 400 dan delivered by No. 24. The deliveries were received by No. 6 for 200 dan, No. 12 for 500 dan, No. 16 for 100 dan, No. 35 for 400 dan, and No. 38 for 100 dan. Currently, the spot wheat market has tightened, and Shaoxing wheat has opened to 6.1 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's market for late-season indica rice continued to soften due to abundant arrivals. Shipments from various ports in Jiangxi, Hunan, Shahan, and others totaled more than 20,000 bags per day. The market seemed likely to continue to decline, but merchants from Guangdong and Shantou suddenly became active. Shantou merchants purchased 3,000 bags of various types of rice, and Guangdong merchants purchased 4,000 bags of various types of coarse and broken rice. The market immediately rebounded, and the decline slowed. Beiyang merchants in this street also accommodated several hundred bags of each type. Therefore, while Yuan rice and other types saw a small price decline, coarse and other types of rice were able to hold steady. The opening price for Gan rice was more than 3,000 bags, for Xiang rice it was more than 4,000 bags, and for Yongtai machine-milled Yuan rice it was more than 400 bags.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, arrivals from various merchants totaled over 100, with a total of more than 22,300 shi of goods. Thin rice still accounted for 60-70 merchants, but the desire for thin rice remained sluggish. Merchants from Pingjin Qingyan and other regions only purchased more than 6,000 bags, and they all selected high-quality goods. Mid-range goods seemed to be rejected unless they were particularly good, leading to a continued softening of the market. As a result, high-quality goods fell slightly by 0.07 yuan, while mid-range goods fell by 0.1-0.02 yuan. Thick粳 rice sales amounted to over 700 bags, which was still acceptable, so prices did not change much. Du jian had an oversupply, so prices were reduced slightly by 0.05 yuan. Yang jian had no transactions. Yin yuan remained stagnant and prices also fell by a few yuan.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, there were 35-36 boats from various merchants along the river. The sales of white粳 in the market continued, and prices were stable. Early rice was stable. The desire for thin rice from merchants continued, and merchants in this street continued to take them, stabilizing the market. Sales of Yangbu Du jian were even, and prices did not change. Rong jian remained stable. Sales of Yuan yuan were still acceptable, and prices tightened slightly.</p>

<p>The silk market in Shanghai has become quiet again. Silk prices in Japan and the U.S. have been dull recently. Sales in the U.S. and France have not improved. Because prices are higher in Shanghai, silk telegrams are rarely transacted. Yesterday, only Jardine and Mitsui purchased a small amount from white factories. The market has been neither good nor bad. There were also few transactions for user silk, with only 3-5 bags of sporadic buying. Therefore, the current silk market is gradually trending towards a stable situation.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Sugar Market: Transactions of Coarse White Sugar from Guangdong Increase, Dutch Sugar Arrives with 20,728 Bags, New Chaoqing Falls Slightly by 0.4-0.5 Yuan <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable. The association's clearing price for spot 24 coarse yarn white sugar was 21.5 yuan, and for transshipment goods it was 6.08 yuan. Dongbai had no significant change, but spot No. 8 was slightly down by 0.05 yuan, to 21.15 yuan. Jinxin No. 1 cotton white from the Sixth Factory was 20.4 yuan, and the rest followed. According to the airmail and telegram confirmation yesterday, New Chaoqing arrivals have indeed increased recently. The quantity increased from 100-200 bags per day to over 1,000 bags, so prices have softened. Higher-priced goods fell from 14.1 yuan (clearing price) to 13.6-13.7 yuan. The rumor of a sudden surge of 1 yuan last week was false. The 800+ bags of New Hainan Red that arrived earlier were not opened because the quality was poor and the price was 13.8 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of this week's bidding for Guangdong sugar by the joint company. The total quota was 17,808 bags. 1,660 bags of Shunde Factory's Five Goat Coarse White were sold at 21.3 yuan, 120 bags of Shixin Factory were sold at 21.1 yuan, 200 bags of Shantou Factory were sold at 20.9 yuan, another 120 bags were sold at 20.7 yuan, 2,000 bags of Shunde Five Goat Coarse White were sold at 21.2 yuan, 1,734 bags of Huizhou were sold at 21.2 yuan, all of which were sold smoothly, totaling 5,834 bags.</p>
<p>The Zhibade ship arrived yesterday with 4,016 bags of Dutch 24 coarse white sugar and 16,712 bags of Dutch red sugar.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Dried Fruits and Nuts: Black Watermelon Seeds Sell Slowly <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The sales of black watermelon seeds have been slow recently, so the market trend is very stable. This is because the inventory in both the producing areas and Shanghai is not thick, so although the current market price is not low, there is still a possibility of rising in the future. The previous two days, Tijiazhuang seeds opened at 21.8 yuan, and Gao Xukui seeds opened at 21.2 yuan. If sales improve in the future, there is hope for upward movement. Yesterday, Xingpan sold Jikui seeds for 24 yuan to 23.5 yuan, Tijiazhuang seeds for 22 yuan, Xukui seeds for 20.5 yuan to 21 yuan, Mingguang seeds for 18.5 yuan, and Dalian seeds for 16.8 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Sundries: Nanning Fennel Market Trend Remains Tight <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Nanning fennel has been arriving continuously in recent days, but sales from various regions are still active, so the trend remains tight. Yesterday, a total of over two hundred bales were offered, with the highest price at thirty-one yuan, and the second highest at twenty yuan and a half, an increase of fifty cents. The market may be able to recover slightly, as it is currently a time of active sales, and merchants are selling more heartily.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Metals: Eastern White Iron Unusually Expensive <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The market for Eastern white iron has been very brisk for the past few days. This is because factories, seeing that the price of black iron sheets (used as the base for white iron) has risen sharply, have also increased their selling prices in this port. Yesterday, 3-foot by 7-foot sheets sold for $1.20 each, a dime more than before, and 3-foot by 6-foot sheets sold for $1.00 each, also seven or eight cents more than before. Recently, buyers have been making every effort to purchase, while factories are restricting sales and unwilling to easily release goods. It seems likely that the market will continue to improve. It is reported that a total of seven or eight thousand sheets were sold in the market yesterday and the day before. However, the lowest quoted price was $1.12 or $1.13 for 7-foot sheets, and $0.92 or $0.93 for 6-foot sheets. Current transactions are not at these prices, and sellers are unwilling to let go of their goods.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Pig Lead Prices Reach Peak <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The price of pig lead reached $31 per picul yesterday, the highest price in more than a decade. Bulk transactions were relatively quiet, but scattered sales were still taking place. It is said that overseas prices have recently risen sharply, and inventories in this port are low, so it is feared that prices will be difficult to bring down.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Oil Market: Hankou and Shanghai Turpentine Supplies Both Interrupted; Jiaxing New Oil Only 10% of Normal Yield; Hankou Old Oil Almost Completely Collected <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The turpentine market is extremely unusual. Turpentine in both Hankou and Shanghai has long been collected by foreign firms. Hankou relies on new Macheng oil, which can be transported by carts, with dozens of shipments arriving every day or every other day, all of which are eagerly pre-ordered by various groups. However, it is unknown how many people are eagerly awaiting supplies. Such a large market has been interrupted for half a month, and there is still no definite date for new supplies to arrive, which is unprecedented since the opening of the market. The yield of new Jingzhou oil is still abundant, but it is usually only available after winter, so it is not expected to be used to supplement supplies at this time. However, the old oil production areas have not yet shipped everything out, as upstream waters are shallow and obstructed. It is said that "you can hear the ladder ringing, but you can't see anyone coming down the stairs." The situation in Hankou is as described above.</p>
<p>The interruption in Shanghai has also lasted for two weeks. Each year, at the time of new production, it relies on the nearby Jiaxing oil transported by local carts to supplement supplies. According to this year's yield, it is only 10% of normal. Last year, new oil production could reach 60,000 pieces, but this winter only 6,000 pieces can be produced, and the quoted price has risen to $8.55 or $8.60 per dan. This is equivalent to a new oil cost of about $27 per market scale. The oil mills are only accumulating and not selling, waiting for a better price in the future. However, there are still more than 10,000 pieces of old oil, but they are all in the hands of speculators, who are increasingly unwilling to sell as prices rise, which is equivalent to having no goods. The inventory of carting companies is very low. It is said they must sell for $26. The output in Jinhua and Lanxi in eastern Zhejiang is about to peak, but there has been too much selling. The daily production has to be used to settle forward oil contracts, so current sales are also limited. Furthermore, the combined price to ship to Shanghai must be above $23, and there are still no goods for sale. Foreign firms are still continuing to purchase, but no further deals have been heard since the price passed $24 per pound, so it is feared that prices will not approach this level for some time. Foreign firms in Hankou and Yichang have already sold a lot. Before summing up accounts, the oil produced was used to settle with foreign firms, leaving very little remaining. Therefore, foreign firms will not trade again until February or March. According to news from Hankou, Shanghai foreign firms have already purchased, for delivery in a few months, with two or three hundred tons in transactions, but there is no such saying in this port, so it must be investigated further to confirm.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Excessive Drop in River Water Level; White Tung Oil Supply Delayed; Abundant Production, Beware of Small Market in Future <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>More than two months have passed since the new tung oil production began. The foreign firms sold in Hankou are all current oil during the transition between new and old oil, and the quantities are scattered. Therefore, although transactions continue intermittently, the impact on the market is minimal. What can change the market is the large number of forward oil contracts. Roughly speaking, the amount sold at that time for November was not much, so exports this month are not strong. Although the market sometimes experiences ups and downs, the overall trend is that price fluctuations are minimal. It is fortunate that this is the case, because the Yangtze River water level is extremely shallow. If exports were slightly stronger, it would inevitably be insufficient to meet demand. It is unknown what the scene would be if the current oil supply were short. According to the current supply in Hankou, it can only be used for foreign firms to replenish a small amount of current delivery. If the delivery of a large number of forward oil contracts is due next month, and the water remains shallow and delayed, and the arrival of goods is still as scattered as it is now, a large shortage of current oil is inevitable. Therefore, Hankou firms stopped selling forward oil to foreign firms on December 1, and recently all sales have been for February. The highest price sold was $50 per ton, then $49.50, and then $49. The yield in Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei this year is abundant, so people were originally very happy. The reason why prices cannot fall now is actually because the supply is blocked by shallow water. When transportation becomes convenient, there will inevitably be a day when goods flood in. Therefore, merchants are willing to sell forward contracts at a lower price. Since the establishment of vegetable oil factories in this port, tung oil has been the first type of oil to be produced. Although it is said to specialize in refining, it also engages in foreign trade. It is reported that more than 100 tons have been purchased in Hankou and are currently being tested, with gradual efforts to expand. Foreign firms selling refined oil must have it refined by this factory, with a fixed refining fee of 8 jiao per ton. However, at present, it is only used for oil produced in Zhejiang Province and has not yet been popularized for use in Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces. As for Zhejiang tung oil, as the origin has sold forward oil in advance, the current production can only be used to settle current goods, so the current oil is very popular. The price per cwt must be $47.68 for Shanghai delivery, and only a few orders can be taken, also because the water level of the Qiantang River is shallow, and the arrival of goods is not convenient for loading and transportation.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Soybean Oil and Peanut Oil Prices Expected to Rise <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the market prices of soybean oil and peanut oil have risen because the northern region has entered the river freezing season, causing all roads to rush shipments. Production prices have risen daily, and it is said that Qingdao will increase export taxes, so the market is excited. The price of Niuzhuang soybean oil has reached $23, and the situation is still tense. Yesterday, the market opened with 200 pieces of local factory soybean oil, 250 pieces of Niuzhuang soybean oil, 50 pieces of Dalian soybean oil, 100 pieces of Dalian Qishan soybean oil, 100 pieces of Yantai Qishan soybean oil, 200 pieces of Qingdao Qishan soybean oil, 100 pieces of Bo'er peanut oil, 200 pieces of Jiacang raw oil, 100 pieces of Qingpi raw oil, and 100 pieces of Jiaozhou transported raw oil. Prices have increased by 3 jiao compared to the previous market.</p>

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>First, Qu Wenliu was elected as temporary chairman. Mr. Qu stood up and reported on the purpose of establishing the association, stating in brief that this time, the border regions were disturbed by the pseudo-bandits, causing immense suffering. Especially during this severely cold weather, soldiers are defending the country and resisting the war in freezing conditions, and the people are suffering from cold and hunger. Therefore, charitable people from Shanghai are gathered to establish this association to promote disaster relief efforts in the border regions, in order to fulfill the duty of our people in the rear. He then reported that the Zhenwu Committee had agreed to allocate 100,000 yuan in public bonds for the association's disaster relief efforts. Master Yingguang also donated over 1,500 yuan of conversion money to the association.</p>
<p>Preparatory Process</p>
<p>After the chairman's report, Li Dachao reported on the preparatory process of the association, stating that the national defense gateway is currently disturbed by the pseudo-Mongolian bandit army, and the soldiers at the front are bravely resisting. We in the rear should enthusiastically contribute, as it is said, "Seeing what is right, act courageously, and a benevolent person will not yield." Then, Wang Xiaolai reported on his trip to Suiyuan and Chahar, stating that our country, both the government and the people, must protect the integrity of the national territory, the integrity of politics, and the integrity of the military. Under unified command, we will resist the war to the end. Today's government is not the government of the past, and today's people are not the people of the past. The establishment of this association is to demonstrate the power of the people.</p>

<p>Purpose of Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The purpose of the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Relief Association states: "Recently, the national crisis has become increasingly serious. Suiyuan is an important town in our northwest border defense, and war has already broken out. Fortunately, the soldiers at the front are fulfilling their duty to protect the country and defend the people, bravely fighting and frequently reporting victories. However, we must remember that the area is inherently bitterly cold, and now it is severe winter. Suffering this calamity, in the freezing conditions, under the rain of bullets and guns, the number of displaced and dead people is simply unknown. The charitable organizations of Shanghai have always enthusiastically engaged in disaster relief efforts. Now that the compatriots in the war zone are crying out under the blades of weapons, how can we bear to sit idly by? We should work together with one heart and devote ourselves to the duty of rescue and care. Saving the country and saving people is also saving ourselves. We, the colleagues, are based on this principle to organize this association, deeply hoping to gather great spirit and strength for the common cause of relief, according to the direction of the incident, to the extent of our ability, in order to boost the morale of the people and promote the prestige of the country. People from all walks of life, stirred by righteous indignation, naturally have sympathy. We hope that they will enthusiastically support and donate generously, strive forward, enthusiastically serve, share the same boat, and make concerted efforts. We present these sincere words and humbly request your consideration."</p>

<h3 id="e126">Wang Chonghui Discusses That World War Is Closer - Possible Outbreak at Any Time - Italy Seems to Officially Recognize Manchukuo - League of Nations Should Make a Solemn Statement <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Following the successive signing of the Japan-Germany and Japan-Italy agreements, the international community is divided into two major fronts, and the situation is more tense than before. A reporter from the Shenshi News Agency specially visited Mr. Wang Chonghui, member of the Central Supervisory Committee, on the morning of the 30th, and he kindly made a statement.</p>
<p>World War - Outbreak is Faster</p>
<p>The Second World War is imminent. Although the Spanish war appears on the surface to be an internal conflict in Spain, in fact, the government army and the revolutionary army have international backgrounds, and each has other countries behind them providing assistance. In reality, it is no different from an international war. Since Japan, Germany, and Italy have successively signed agreements, the front lines of the international war have become increasingly clear, and the outbreak of the Second World War is also faster. Now, all countries in the world are uniformly stepping up military preparations, and the danger of war has reached its peak. An outbreak is possible at any time. Once an unexpected international event occurs, such as the event of the First World War, then the war will occur.</p>
<p>League of Nations - Prestige Is Difficult to Recover</p>
<p>The League of Nations now has absolutely no prestige to sanction and maintain peace. The biggest reason is that the power of public opinion in the world cannot match military power. For example, in the case of Italy's invasion of Abyssinia, most of the public opinion around the world sympathized with Abyssinia. European and American authoritative journalists all loudly attacked Italy, but in fact, it was ultimately difficult to match military power. Although the League of Nations passed economic sanctions by its member states, it was of no avail because Italy had already purchased military supplies before the war, resulting in no results. In addition, the League of Nations' procedures are too cumbersome, which is also a reason for losing prestige. After the incident occurs, it must go through lengthy procedures such as investigation, research, and meetings, which is of no help. Moreover, no matter what, it is difficult to match military power. Therefore, it is difficult for the League of Nations to restore its prestige in fact. The League of Nations has now established a reform committee to engage in reforming the League of Nations' organization. However, since Japan, Germany, and other countries have withdrawn from the League of Nations, it is not easy to restore prestige.</p>
<p>Italy Recognizes Manchukuo - Should Have a Statement</p>
<p>The cooperation between Germany and Italy with Japan is entirely for the European aspect, while Japan is for the Asian aspect. It has a considerable impact on China, but the impact on Soviet Russia should be even greater. The relationship between China and Italy has always been good. This time, Italy cooperated with Japan due to its own interests, which is quite unexpected. However, Italy has not yet withdrawn from the League of Nations. It has been telegraphed for days that Italy recognizes Manchukuo in exchange with Japan for recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. If Italy officially expresses its recognition of Manchukuo, then I (Wang said himself) think that the League of Nations should have a solemn statement, because the League of Nations has not yet recognized Manchukuo. If a member state openly recognizes it, the League of Nations should naturally have a solemn statement.</p>
<p>Our Country Should Seek - Self-Reliance and Revival</p>
<p>The international situation is becoming increasingly serious, and the fate of the Chinese nation is becoming even more precarious. On this path of survival, we have no other way but to seek self-reliance and revival, because international relations are all based on the interests of the country, and there is no such thing as justice and friendship. If we have strong national strength, we can cooperate with other countries and seek true friendship, he said.</p>

<p>In recent years, because countries around the world have generally felt economic panic, they have dumped domestic surpluses abroad, with our country as the final recipient. As for fruit, our country's annual output is also huge, but farmers adhere to old methods, leading to gradual decline. Foreign businessmen take the opportunity to rise, resulting in our country's imports of fruit reaching a total value of 6.5 million yuan last year, according to customs statistics. Apples accounted for 500,000 yuan, with American goods being the most, accounting for six-tenths of the total. Japan, Taiwan, Australia, and Canada were next. Raisin imports also reached 500,000 yuan. Orange imports reached 1.5 million yuan, also with the United States being the most, accounting for seven-tenths of the total. Japan, Taiwan, and other places accounted for about 500,000 yuan. There are also Siamese honey oranges, etc., that have not been included. As for American watermelons and the jackfruit, bananas, coconuts, lychees, etc. from the South Seas Islands, imports reached more than 4 million yuan. It is now heard that the Ministry of Industry's Bureau of International Trade, in order to reduce import value, plans to statistically analyze the country's fruit in the shortest time and send personnel to various producing areas to provide guidance and improvement, so that it can develop outward and revitalize the rural economy.</p>

<p>The settlement period for member banks of the Shanghai Banking Association is implemented at the end of June and the end of December each year. As for the settlement period for member money houses of the Qian Industry Association, it has always been implemented on the day of the major year-end closing of each industry (that is, the end of the old lunar year). Now, because the Ministry of Finance has approved the implementation of the deposit interest income tax from January 1 next year, for convenience, it has been resolved by the 28th Executive Committee meeting of the third session to settle all deposits, etc. at the end of December. The above method will be submitted to the members' general meeting tomorrow for approval, and then a notice will be issued to member money houses to comply.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Local Association telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday, stating: "To Chairman Chen of the Zhenjiang Provincial Government, with respect. We have just received a letter from the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, stating that the Qingpu County Rice Industry Association reported on the 26th of this month that the Qingpu County Government suddenly sent police to detain rice boats transporting rice to Shanghai in the Zhujiajiao area of Qingpu, saying that they must have a passport before they can be released. Although representatives of our association visited the county magistrate and requested exemption from detention, they were not approved, etc. Rice merchants also reported that the same situation occurred in Jinshan County. We were asked to forward this to the Provincial Government and separately order the release, and to not detain them again in the future, etc. We have investigated that the food of the people of Shanghai depends on the supply from the mainland. It is reported that the Executive Yuan has decided that food should be allowed to circulate freely in all provinces. It seems that the counties of Jiangsu Province should not detain rice boats again, nor is it necessary to use passports again. We have approved the previous situation, and accordingly telegraphically request your Provincial Government to order Qingpu and Jinshan counties to quickly release the rice boats in order to maintain the lives of the people. This would be greatly appreciated. The Shanghai Local Association respectfully kowtows."</p>

<p>Li Hongwen, Director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters Office in Nanjing, representing Yan Xishan, to thank the comfort representatives who went to Suiyuan, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. After resting briefly, he went to the Central Bank to visit Minister Kong to report on the situation of bandit suppression at the front line. According to an interview with a reporter from the Shenshi News Agency, after our army recovered Bailingmiao on the 24th, all the territory of Suiyuan has been completely restored. There are currently no bandit troops in the territory. Our army is consolidating defense works. From now on, no matter Mongolian bandits, pseudo-bandits, or any other infringement, we will definitely hit them head-on. Although there are occasional bandit aircraft dropping bombs in the Bailingmiao area, it does not cause any damage to our army. However, anti-poison equipment should be prepared urgently. Reading the newspaper this morning, I learned that an anti-gas mask society has been established in Shanghai, which is very grateful. I plan to visit and discuss it. In Shanghai, I still have to meet with representatives from all sectors who went to Suiyuan to offer condolences, such as Mr. Wang Xiaolai and Du Yuesheng, to thank them on behalf of Director Yan. I plan to stay in Shanghai for three or four days before returning to Nanjing, he said. The following is a summary of Chairman Fu's thank-you telegram:</p>

<h3 id="e131">Changbang Rice Boats Stop Measuring - The Hufu Association Sends Personnel to Persuade to Not Stop Measuring Temporarily - Submits a Petition to the Party and Government to Urgently Ban - To Alleviate the Suffering of the People of Jiangsu - Announces to All Sectors - Exposes the Inside Story - Strict Sanctions <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Xiehe and others of the Caohujia Du Rice Shop in West Shanghai used heavy measures to retain rice, and because the Changbang Rice Boat Merchants could not bear their exploitation, they decided to implement a measurement stoppage. In order to maintain the food supply for the people of Shanghai, the Changshu Gongsuo in Shanghai held an emergency meeting yesterday, sent personnel to persuade the boat merchants, and submitted a petition to the party and government agencies requesting a ban. The following is an investigation of the situation:</p>
<p>Send Personnel to Persuade</p>
<p>The Changshu Gongsuo in Shanghai, learning that the Changbang Rice Boats in the Caojiadu area were implementing a measurement stoppage in protest against heavy measures to retain rice, held an emergency meeting at 3 pm yesterday at No. 2 Changchunfang, Changan Road, Xinzha Bridge, fearing that it would affect the food supply for the people of Shanghai. More than ten people, including directors Shi Zufuu, Qu Renzhi, Shen Xiaowu, Lu Junwen, Zhu Fusong, Yan Genjin, were present. Chairman Lu Muqin reported that the Caojiadu boat merchants requested a ban on heavy measures to retain rice and were forced to implement a measurement stoppage to strive for it. It was resolved on the spot that, in order to maintain the food supply and regulate grain transportation, Chen Yushu and Xu Yangjian were specially sent to persuade the boat merchants to not stop measuring temporarily, and to wait patiently for the party and government agencies to ban according to law.</p>
<p>Announce to All Sectors</p>
<p>For the purpose of notification, the member boat merchants parked at Caojiadu have reported successively that the shops have instigated the hufu to use heavy measures to retain rice, exploiting profits, and requesting a ban, etc. After the institute received the reports, it sent personnel to negotiate with the shops there, but not only did they not improve, but they also stated that it was a habit of the Caojiadu Rice Shop and difficult to eliminate. We have investigated that our boat merchants transport rice, directly for profit and to make a living, and indirectly also to regulate grain, braving wind and rain, enduring cold and heat, and hoping to make a small profit from transporting rice. Who knew that after the shops and the hufu used heavy measures to retain rice, the amount of rice lost per measure was more than one sheng, and on average, for each boat of 150 dan (300 measures), the loss would be about three or four dan. This kind of evil habit is even more severe than the previous yamen officials and checkpoints. If the boat merchants do not accept heavy measures to retain rice, the shop staff will go on board and grab the rice themselves. If they are not satisfied, they will be beaten. The boat merchants' material losses have been endless over the years. In order to relieve the suffering of the boat merchants, based on the request of the members, this institute plans to temporarily stop measuring. This is not an extra request from our boat merchants, and it will affect the food supply for the people of Shanghai. Whose responsibility is it? For this reason, we are revealing our true feelings, hoping that all sectors will understand.</p>
<p>Request a Ban</p>
<p>A document to the Municipal Party Department and the Bureau of Social Affairs states: "Submitting a petition to ban heavy measures to retain rice in order to maintain the livelihood of the boat merchants. We have investigated that the Caojiadu area rice shops collude with the hufu to use heavy measures to retain rice. After the institute submitted a letter to the Municipal Bureau of Weights and Measures and the Bean and Rice Industry Association requesting a ban, it was approved that the Bean and Rice Industry Association replied that it had notified the industry in both the north and south cities to ban heavy measures to retain rice. The institute immediately notified the boat merchants to comply according to the reply from the association, and after consulting with the Shanghai North Transportation Rice Boat Merchants Association and the north city shops, because it was not easy to eliminate heavy measures temporarily, it was changed to temporarily banning the rice retaining first, and considerable results have been achieved. However, the Caojiadu shops, after the institute sent personnel to negotiate, not only did not accept the ban on heavy measures, but also stated that this was a long-standing custom of Caojiadu and difficult to reform (excerpt omitted). Our boat merchants, because their capital is at stake, would rather sacrifice their business and are unwilling to suffer illegal exploitation. They implement freedom of business in order to passively resist. On the one hand, it is also to urge the shops to consider the difficulties of the boat customers and improve. Who knew that the shops would send staff and apprentices to go on board and grab the rice themselves. If they are not satisfied, they will be beaten. Freedom of business cannot be forced on others. This kind of behavior is no different from bandits. The Changbang Boat Merchants in Caojiadu originally planned to stop measuring as soon as possible to alleviate the suffering. At this time when the Sui border is invaded by bandits, in order to maintain local security and the food supply for the people of Shanghai, we still submit a petition to your (Department) (Bureau) to deal with it properly as soon as possible in accordance with legal procedures, so as to ban it as soon as possible, in order to maintain the business of the boat merchants. This is for the public convenience."</p>

<p>According to reports, the investigation is scheduled for six months. Hu Qingyu, Commissioner for Investigating the League of Nations Administrative Organization specially appointed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, came to Shanghai a few days ago to wait for the ship after being appointed. It was originally scheduled to depart yesterday on the Russian ship Beifang, but the ship only arrived in Shanghai yesterday, so it was postponed to depart north today. Therefore, Mr. Hu's departure date was also postponed by one day. According to Mr. Hu, speaking to a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency yesterday, my trip is solely for the task of investigating the League of Nations administrative organization. It is scheduled to take the Siberian Railway train after arriving in Vladivostok, transfer to Poland, Germany, and go directly to Geneva, without any stops along the way.

<h3 id="e133">Hangzhou-Yushan Section Track Replacement Loan Agreement Finalized, Shanghai Syndicate to Provide Loan at 1% Annual Interest for Six Years, Czech Loan of Six Million for Materials to Be Finalized <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Sin Sin News reports: The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway's Hangzhou-Yushan section is to replace its tracks with heavier ones. A loan of 2.8 million yuan from a Shanghai syndicate has been agreed upon. Furthermore, the Ministry of Railways is in talks with a Czech company for a loan of 28,000 tons of steel rails and materials, valued at 6 million yuan. These negotiations are nearing completion. Work on the track replacement is scheduled to begin in early January next year, aiming for simultaneous completion and traffic opening with the Nanchang-Pingxiang section. The Sin Sin News reporter has obtained the following detailed information:</p>
<p>Track Replacement Loan Agreement Finalized</p>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Council has decided to replace the current 35-pound light rails of the Hangzhou-Yushan section with 63-pound heavy rails, aligning it with the Yushan-Nanchang and Nanchang-Pingxiang sections. Besides materials, the required construction cost is 2.8 million yuan. After negotiations with the Shanghai syndicate, consisting of the Bank of China, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Zhejiang Local Bank (the China Industrial and Commercial Bank and Zhejiang Industrial Bank have withdrawn), a draft agreement has been finalized. According to the reporter's inquiries, the agreement includes: (1) The Bank of China will be responsible for 1.8 million yuan, while the Farmers Bank of China and the Zhejiang Local Bank will each handle 500,000 yuan. (2) All assets and business income of the Hangzhou-Yushan section will be used as collateral. (3) The annual interest rate is 1%, with the principal and interest to be fully repaid within six years. Jin Runquan, the representative of the syndicate and the manager of the Bank of China's Hangzhou branch, has telegraphed the head office and plans to personally visit Shanghai soon to further discuss the matter with the head office and the other two banks before formally signing the agreement.</p>
<p>Materials Loan Also Nearing Success</p>
<p>In addition to the construction costs for the Hangzhou-Yushan section's replacement with 63-pound heavy rails, which are being borrowed from the Shanghai syndicate, the steel rails, sleepers, and other materials will be borrowed by the Ministry of Railways from a Czech railway materials factory. The materials include 28,000 tons of steel rails, valued at 6 million yuan in national currency. According to banking circles, the loan is progressing smoothly. After several rounds of negotiations between the two parties, an agreement is generally in sight and is expected to be successfully signed soon. The annual interest rate is expected to be between 4% and 5%, with a term of six years. The contract signing will follow the precedent of the previous Yushan-Nanchang and Nanchang-Pingxiang sections, borrowing materials from the German Otto Wolff steel factory, so there should be no problems.</p>
<p>Track Replacement Scheduled to Begin</p>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau has been ordered to complete the Nanchang-Pingxiang section by the end of March next year. All construction loans have been negotiated with the syndicate, and the amount of disbursements has been increased since this month, so the progress of various projects is quite rapid. It is expected to be completed before the deadline in March next year. It has been decided to advance the start of the Hangzhou-Yushan section track replacement project to early January next year. Before all materials arrive, materials from the Nanchang-Pingxiang section will be temporarily borrowed, aiming for simultaneous completion with the Nanchang-Pingxiang section. At that time, the entire route of the Hangzhou-Yushan, Yushan-Nanchang, and Nanchang-Pingxiang sections will be fully open to traffic to facilitate transportation. Whether it can be realized according to the planned method depends on the progress of the project.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Revised Long-Distance Telephone Business Regulations to Be Implemented Today, Shanghai Telephone Bureau Notifies Users Yesterday <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has revised the domestic long-distance telephone business regulations, which will be implemented simultaneously across the country starting today. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau issued a special notice to its users yesterday, stating: "We have received Instruction No. 4025 of the Ministry of Communications' Electrical Affairs Department, which states: 'After examination, the number of long-distance telephone lines in various regions of the country has expanded year by year. The long-distance telephone lines of nine provinces have also been opened for business one after another. The Shanghai-Hankou wireless telephone has also been opened for communication. Long-distance telephone business is becoming increasingly complex. The long-distance telephone business regulations promulgated by the Ministry on June 2, 1933, are no longer suitable for the current business situation. Therefore, new domestic long-distance telephone business regulations have been formulated, which were promulgated on October 15 of this year and stipulated to take effect from December 1. Now, we are sending you 50 copies each of the domestic long-distance telephone business regulations and the domestic long-distance telephone classification price comparison table. Please comply with them and instruct others to comply with them.' Therefore, we should comply with it and implement it from tomorrow (i.e., today). In addition to printing the domestic long-distance telephone business regulations and the classification price comparison table in the first half of the 26th year telephone directory of this bureau for distribution to users and for reference, the important provisions of the new regulations are listed as follows: (1) Changes in the names of various types of calls. Previously, it was called 'Ordinary Call,' now it is changed to 'Normal Call.' 'Expedited Call' is now changed to 'Expedited Call.' 'Ordinary Notification' is changed to 'Normal Caller.' 'Expedited Notification' is changed to 'Expedited Caller.' 'Ordinary Call' is changed to 'Normal Call.' 'Expedited Call' remains 'Expedited Call.' 'Scheduled Call' is changed to 'Timed Call.' (2) Changes in the scope of calls. The current regulations stipulate that the scope of calls is limited to three kilometers from the bureau, a reduction of two kilometers compared to the past. (3) Changes in the call fee. Article 17 of the new regulations stipulates that the price of a call is the same as the price of a caller, and the previously charged special effort fee has been canceled. The above three points are the most important differences compared to the past. As for the special business chapter in the new regulations, all special calls and timed calls will be suspended until detailed measures are formulated. The night calls will still be handled in accordance with the previous regulations. Furthermore, the prices of all calls are based on the normal call prices specified in the ordinary price list. You can find out by referring to the classification price comparison table. Note: 1. All prices are based on national currency. 2. The prices specified in the ordinary price list are the normal call prices. If you want to know the normal caller, normal call, expedited call, expedited caller, or expedited call price from a certain place to a certain place, you should first check the normal call price between the two places in the ordinary price list, and then use the normal call price as a basis for comparison with this table to get the price you want to know. For example, the normal call price between Nanjing and Hankou is 2 yuan, then the normal caller price is 2.4 yuan, the expedited caller price is 4.4 yuan, and so on. 3. The cancellation fee from a certain place to a certain place is the same for all types of calls. 4. The call fee and cancellation fee for all types of telephone calls between Zhejiang Province are calculated and charged separately according to the ministry line and the provincial line, regardless of whether it is a caller or a call, and regardless of whether it is normal or expedited. The above is only a summary. If users need the 'Ministry of Communications Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Business Regulations,' they can obtain it from the business section of the bureau."</p>

<h3 id="e139">Large Quantities of Rice Transported to Shanghai from Rice-Producing Areas <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Very Little Rice Confiscated in Qingpu and Other Counties After rice was confiscated in Qingpu, Jinshan, Xinghua, and other counties when it was being transported out of the area, the rice industry in Shanghai, believing that this violated the central government's public order on rice circulation regulation, requested the authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to order the counties that had confiscated the rice to release it quickly. According to rice industry sources, the amount of rice confiscated in these counties is small. Other rice-producing areas can still transport rice to Shanghai, so there is no impact on the city's food supply and rice market. Moreover, since the Shanghai rice industry appealed to the authorities of the two provinces, the rice is expected to be released within a few days, and similar incidents should not occur again in the future.</p>

<p>Wu Zuyao, a 25-year-old native of Ningbo, has been working as an apprentice and later promoted to warehouse keeper at Qingyun Jewelry Store at No. 685 Nanjing Road for ten years. This summer, due to a debt of over 700 yuan owed to the store, he was dismissed by the manager, Yan Zhijun. Wu then resided at No. 201 Chongqing Road. Because he was familiar with all the store's employees, he still frequented the store. At about 8 p.m. on the 26th of the month, after Qingyun had closed, Wu went there again to chat with the store staff.</p>
<p>Since Wu had worked in the store for quite some time, he was very familiar with the location of the important keys. Taking advantage of everyone's inattention, he stole the safe key kept by Zhuang Yingxia, the silver box key kept by Liu Shutang, and the gold jewelry box key kept by Wu Xinpei. He then stole 122 taels of gold jewelry (worth 16,800 yuan) and 4868 yuan in legal tender, put them in a rattan box, and hired a</p>
<p>Southern Motor Vehicle</p>
<p>to go home. Before leaving, in an attempt to destroy the evidence, he set fire to the paper wrapping the gold jewelry, intending to set the fire to destroy the evidence. Although the fire started at the time, it only charred part of the wall panel and the box. The fire was extinguished immediately, and no major disaster occurred. The next morning, Zhuang Yingxia discovered the theft and reported it to the manager, who then reported it to the Old Gate Patrol Room. Chief Detective Lu Gengsheng and Detective Song Wenqing and Zhu Heshang were immediately ordered to investigate and found that Wu was suspected of</p>
<p>Major Suspicion</p>
<p>They immediately went to Wu's relatives to investigate Wu's whereabouts. After stealing the gold jewelry and banknotes, Wu initially hid them at his residence, but thinking it was not safe, he moved all the stolen goods to his wife's brother, Ye Xinde, at Yuanhe Herbal Medicine Shop, No. 119 Lizhou Gua Street, Nanshi, on the same night, intending to retrieve them the next day. However, the police had already found out and Ye handed over all the stolen goods deposited by Wu. Only</p>

<h3 id="e142">The Bao Gang Case Continued Yesterday, Witnesses Called Testified Inconsistently With Court Order, Continued Hearing Awaited <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Lawyer Bao Gang and Cui Changgui, bodyguard of Liu Huaizhi, captain of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Team, are accused of seducing Yang Yuehua, Cui's cohabitating fiancée, and Zhang Qinghong, the third district chief of Chuansha County, of harboring Bao Gang's teahouse worker Zhang Xinkui, thereby aiding in the seduction. The local court's prosecutor has publicly prosecuted Bao Gang and Zhang Xinkui for violating family ethics, and the Jiangsu Surveillance Commissioner's Office has also dispatched personnel to investigate and report Zhang Qinghong. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, this case was again heard in Criminal Court One by Judge Xie Zhengnong. Bao Gang testified that he was 34 years old, from Nanhui, and a graduate of the law program at Chizhi College. He did not know Zhang Qinghong and was not classmates with him. Yang Yuehua came to his house at 3:00 PM on May 10th, saying that Cui Changgui often abused her and requested legal representation. He advised that since they had cohabitated for two or three years, there was no need to go to extremes, and he would write a letter to warn him to reconcile. Yang Yuehua signed her name herself, and he did not take her to the Da Fang Hotel. On May 17th, he was in a meeting at the Pingshe ticket office at 640 Avenue Edward VII until 10:00 PM, so the alleged seduction trip to Chuansha on the 17th was inconsistent timewise. He also said that Zhang Qinghong and his wife were colluding to frame him. Then, Zhang Xinkui testified that he was 48 years old, from Nanhui, and worked as a teahouse worker for Bao Gang. On May 10th, Yang Yuehua came to Bao's house, saying she wanted to find Lawyer Bao to file a lawsuit. He led her to the door of his office, where a guest was walking out, and the door was not closed, but ajar. Yang Yuehua went in herself. The next morning at 8:00 AM, he went out to buy porridge and side dishes. Yang Yuehua asked him if Lawyer Bao was awake, and he said no. After eating breakfast at home, he went to the countryside, telling the rickshaw driver "A'er" to do so, and then he left. It was because his niece was getting married, and he was bringing a pillow core and dried bamboo shoots to the countryside from Shanghai. However, his niece had already come to Shanghai to her brother's house, and her brother was giving her away. Three days after his niece's wedding, he went to his nephew's place in Shanghai, and his niece and her husband came back to their maiden home. He met his nephew-in-law once, and then returned to the countryside for the seventh-day memorial service for his mother. He had not returned to Bao Gang's place, and this was his alibi, etc. At this point, Bao Gang's defense lawyer said that Yang Yuehua had previously testified that when she had intercourse with Bao, she felt that Bao had gonorrhea. He requested that the new forensic report be reviewed. The judge said that it had not yet been returned. Zhang's niece was then called. Miss Zhang testified that she was 23 years old, from Beicai Town, Nanhui. Zhang Xinkui was her paternal uncle, and her husband was named Gu Fengzhou, who lived at 14 Gujiazhai, Shanghai. She was married on the 26th day of the leap month in the lunar calendar this year, which was when she came to Shanghai, and her uncle arrived in the countryside on the 21st. She had seen him. The second day after the wedding, she returned to her maiden home at her brother's house on Fuxing Road in the French Concession, and her uncle was also at her brother's place in Shanghai, etc. At this point, Gu Fengzhou was questioned and testified that he was 35 years old, and Miss Gu-Zhang was his wife. They were married on the 26th day of the third month, and she returned to her maiden home that day. He had already met Zhang Xinkui and exchanged greetings, and on the 27th, a sedan chair came to pick up him and his wife, and they also ate at the same table. The judge immediately ordered the three to come to the court to be questioned as to why their testimonies did not match, and they all stammered. At this point, Mrs. Zhang Yao testified that she was 23 years old, from Chuansha. Zhang Qinghong was her husband and had not come today. The judge instructed that he must be brought to the court next time. Mrs. Zhang said, "Yes." Yang Yuehua was also asked if she knew Bao Gang, and she replied that she did not know him at first. Bao was a classmate of her husband from Chizhi University and came often. Around May 20th, Bao brought Yang Yuehua, saying that she was his concubine and was staying for a few days because she was not getting along with his wife. It lasted for two weeks. Bao came once in the first week, and the two of them closed the back room. Later, Yang Yuehua went to Shanghai and came back three days later, where Cui Changgui found her. Everything was true, etc. At this point, witness Zhang Zheng, the accountant of the Pingshe ticket office, testified to prove that Bao attended the meeting. At this point, the judge adjourned the hearing until a later date, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Li Dehua, a police chief of the Xin Zha branch of the Zhabei Public Security Bureau, a native of Hebei, 34 years old, was suddenly shot at around 8:30 last night, sustaining serious injuries. He was rushed to Baolong Hospital by the bureau's vehicle for treatment, and his condition is critical. Regarding the cause and truth of Li's shooting, inquiries were made to the Xin Zha branch of the Public Security Bureau, but the people in the bureau firmly refused to tell the truth, only saying that Li was shot in Datong Road, and the rest of the details were unknown. The situation is quite complicated and difficult to ascertain at this time.</p>

<p>Mingben Primary School, located upstairs next to the northern side of the Wuzhen Road Police Station in Zhabei, has over one hundred male and female students. The school was closed on Sunday, as usual. Unexpectedly, between 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM, a student named Xu Lianrong, 13 years old (male), from Shaoxing, who lived on Kulun Road in the area, and a student named Ying Qichao, 12 years old, from Ningbo, who lived on Parker Road in the concession, were playing in the school. Xu suddenly went downstairs to look for a billiard ball and lit a match to see in the dark. He inadvertently burned his clothes with the match. He was unable to escape in time. When the school teacher Yang Zhengyi and student Ying Qichao learned of the incident and went to rescue him, Xu's clothes had already turned to charcoal. He was immediately rescued and sent to Renji Hospital in the McTyeire Circle of the concession for treatment. Due to the severity of his injuries, he could not be cured and died at around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. At that time, teacher Yang's right hand and fingers were also burned due to his brave rescue, and student Ying's ears were injured, and his hair was scorched.</p>

<p>Shen Linmei, a local woman, 18 years old, of fair appearance, living at 14 Yinhang Town, Wusong, was lured to Shanghai for fun on the 11th of last month by a local rogue, and then raped and sheltered in a hotel. After pawning Linmei's gold ring, he introduced Linmei to a Mr. Wu, who operated a car, for rape and shelter. Because Mr. Wu already had a wife, he then introduced Linmei to Lu Genfu, an employee of a copper casting factory on Danshui Road. Two people went to the Xinkang Inn on Jessfield Road in western Shanghai for rape and shelter yesterday. Zhao, a patrol officer of the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau, found out and took the two to the bureau for interrogation. The bureau, believing that the case involved the seduction and rape of a young girl, prepared a document and sent it to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>On the evening of September 23rd, a case occurred at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Haining Road, in which Japanese sailors Tian Gang Zhaoguang and others were shot and killed. Afterwards, the police arrested Zhang Ronghe, a Tai Zhou native who sold porridge and who hid a Hanyang pistol in a sand box that had been used in the crime. Zhang Ronghe was sent to the First Special District Court by the police, and the court prosecuted Zhang Ronghe for concealing evidence according to Article 165 of the Criminal Law. After trial, the court pronounced its verdict and acquitted Zhang Ronghe. The Public Works Department refused to accept the verdict. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer with the legal department, appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, and the court concluded the case. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m., Judge Yu Huating, accompanied by Associate Judges Zhou and Nie, and Prosecutor Lin, ascended to the Second Criminal Court and announced the verdict. The main text of the judgment was to reject the appeal, and declared that the case was concluded with two trials and no appeal could be made to the third trial court.

<h3 id="e148">The Yangtze River Rises Again, and River Transportation Is Smooth <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The water level of the Yangtze River has been very shallow. The Jiujiang-Hankou section had dropped to 9 feet 1 inch at its lowest point. Later, the Jianghan Customs surveying vessel discovered a new channel of 10 feet 3 inches, and river steamers were able to resume traffic. However, the navigable section of the new channel was too narrow, and only single steamers could navigate, so river steamers traveling to and fro in the new channel still felt inconvenience. The shallowest point upstream was near Xinzhou and Daijiazhou near Huangshigang above Jiujiang. The various river steamers that were blocked from passing were also in these two places. The Madang area also prohibited night navigation from the 26th. The Sixth Company's ships with shallower drafts could barely pass through the shallow water section, but the cargo loaded on the upstream and downstream steamers was reduced. Today, increased shallow water fees are being implemented. However, yesterday, various steamship companies in Shanghai suddenly received a telegram from Hankou stating that the water level in the Jiujiang-Hankou section had suddenly risen, from 9 feet 1 inch to 10 feet 8 inches, and then from 10 feet 8 inches to 12 feet, and that the Xun-Han section could be safely navigated. The companies were overjoyed and, starting today, ordered the Yangtze River steamers to load more cargo and be able to go directly to Hankou without having to unload at Jiujiang. There are reportedly two reasons for the rise in water level: (1) the weather is warming up; (2) the riverbed is gradually deepening after the shallow water area has been navigated up and down by various river steamers with great difficulty for many days.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the newspaper reported that the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, at the request of overseas Chinese in Nanyang, would operate on the Nanyang route. Because the existing ships were insufficient, the company ordered four new ships from British merchants to increase voyages to various ports in Nanyang. According to a reliable statement from the person in charge of the company, the matter of establishing a new Nanyang route is currently being planned, but there is no truth to the ordering of new ships from British merchants. Chen was nominally a chemist, but in reality, he was the main culprit in the manufacture of drugs, so he set up a large number of special drug-making equipment in his room and secretly manufactured drugs. At 8:30 a.m. on the 27th of last month, a fire suddenly broke out in the kitchen of Chen's home for unknown reasons. The fire was not fierce and was quickly extinguished, but someone had already reported it to the Chengdu Road Patrol Room. Chen Chushi knew that the matter had been exposed and hurriedly abandoned his home and fled without a trace. When Patrol Room Detective Zhou Yushan went to investigate, Chen had already fled far away. Only some white and red powder, two copper and magnetic funnels, two glass bottles, two bottles of acetic acid, one tin of lime, and one glass measuring instrument were seized from the room and taken to the Patrol Room. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court. Judge Fu ordered, in addition to strictly arresting Chen Chushi, who was at large, that the items seized in the case be seized and detained.</p>

<h3 id="e153">The Telegraph Bureau Will Pilot a Method of Returning Telegram Receipts, Starting Today <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>In order to make it easier for people sending telegrams to obtain receipts from the recipients, the Ministry of Communications has specially formulated the "Provisional Measures for the Telegraph Bureau to Return Telegram Receipts," which will be piloted starting December 1st. According to the measures, the sender only needs to pay an additional nine cents for postage, including the postage for single registered printed matter, and indicate the word "receipt" in the telegraph header (RRCP in English telegraphs). The receiving bureau will then issue a "receipt" signed by the recipient and send it to the sending bureau for the sender to keep for verification. At the receiving bureau, an extra copy of the receipt should be prepared for incoming telegrams requiring receipts, and the recipient should be asked to sign and stamp it. Therefore, in reality, the recipient who receives a telegram needs to stamp two receipts. The first one is the receipt from the receiving bureau, which is the receipt on the telegram envelope, and the other one is the "telegram receipt received," which is prepared to be sent to the sender. The above-mentioned method of returning receipts is also applicable to distributed telegrams (that is, one telegram is sent to several recipients), and only one cent of postage is required. However, the word "receipt" must be written before the address and name of each recipient, for example, "Distributed by so-and-so for two receipts - No. so-and-so, so-and-so Street, Nanjing - receipt, so-and-so, so-and-so Street." In addition, if the sender sends multiple telegrams to the same city at the same time, and all of them need to use the receipt method, only one postage fee will be charged. If they are not sent at the same time, the postage fee cannot be reduced. This receipt method is especially suitable for telegrams with monetary relations and other urgent telegrams, or social telegrams with gift certificates attached. However, it is not applicable to international telegrams and domestic news, weather, shipping, and relief telegrams. It is reported that the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of this port has started preparations after receiving the ministry's order and will implement it as scheduled, and has distributed the methods and other information to all sectors for reference.</p>

<h3 id="e162">The Criminal Liu Zhennan in the Tang Youren Case Was Interrogated Yesterday The Hearing Was Closed to the Public Liu Also Confessed to Several People at Large <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Tang Youren, former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Vice Minister of Communications, and Advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, came to Shanghai from Beijing in mid-November of last year. On the evening of the 17th of the same month, he was shot and killed by thugs in front of his private residence at Gancun, Gaston Road, French Concession. Later, the French Police Department and the Shanghai Municipal Government offered a reward for the arrest of the murderers, ordering the Municipal Public Security Bureau to assist the French Patrol Room in arresting the case. It was not until October 19th of this year that the Municipal Public Security Bureau, together with the Public Patrol Room, arrested Liu Zhennan (also known as Zhengnan Wangsheng, 32 years old this year) from Hubei, the murderer in this case, at 228 Meifangli, Lubangshen Road in western Shanghai, and brought him back to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Liu also confessed that his accomplice, Qiu Jiyu, had committed another theft case and was sentenced to imprisonment by the First Special Court and sent to prison for execution. (According to Qiu's theft case, he was sentenced by the First Court. Because the investigation was related to the Tang case, Qiu and other six thieves were transferred by the French Patrol Room and sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation. Because no evidence was found, they were not prosecuted and were sent back to the First Court for execution. This was recorded in the previous newspaper.) At that time, after Tang Youren was killed, Qiu buried the pistol under the open ground near Yinghuali, Lubangshen Road, and confessed to the names of several accomplices at large. Because the incident occurred in the French Concession, the Municipal Public Security Bureau transferred the Liu case to the French Patrol Room for investigation. The situation regarding Qiu's imprisonment in the First Special Court, and the request for the Second Special Court to directly transfer the case, has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the French Patrol Room sent Liu Zhennan to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Judge Wang Gangxu, the head of the Criminal Court, ascended to the seat for interrogation. Yuan Jiahuan, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated the case, saying that the defendant was the murderer who assassinated Tang Youren last year. The Patrol Room must transfer the accomplice Qiu Jiyu from the First Special Court today and request a two-week extension for investigation before filing the lawsuit for interrogation. Because the case was important, he requested that the hearing be closed to the public. The court approved it. During the twenty-minute interrogation, it was heard that Liu admitted to participating in the assassination and confessed the names of several accomplices at large. As a result, the court ordered that the hearing be adjourned to December 16th, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Dockside Boat Damaged <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The Sanbei Company's "Awakened Lion" steamship, arriving in Shanghai on the morning of the day before yesterday at eight o'clock, was sailing past the Pudong Lujiazui outer Bund area when a local resident, Chen Jingtang's, No. 56567 dockside boat, loaded with 350 bales of cottonseed and sailing from the south, caught sight of the "Awakened Lion." The boat hurriedly turned its rudder to divert towards the Puxi side to avoid collision. However, due to the rapid ebb tide, the boat's hull drifted north quickly. The "Awakened Lion" could not stop in time and violently collided with the right bow of Chen's boat. The boat, being made of wood, immediately broke apart, took on water, and sank. Customs water police, upon receiving the alert, urgently dispatched officers aboard a small steamer to provide assistance, ordering nearby boatmen to first retrieve the soaked cotton seeds from the sunken boat's hold and place them on their boats to reduce the weight of the sunken boat and prevent it from sinking into the bottom of the river. They then towed the empty hull to the Bund, where they beached it. All the salvaged wet cotton seeds were loaded onto another empty boat to await further investigation. It is reported that the owner of the goods is Hengxingtai of Caojiadu. Yesterday morning, the captain of the wrecked boat, Shen Gengquan, was dispatched to report the incident to the police station for record.</p>

<p>Gu Jixiang (45 years old), a native of Suzhou, and his wife, Gu Fan (46 years old), have been operating the Shuxiangge Yaoer brothel at No. 9 Hongyun Lane, Route Cardinal Foch, in the French Concession for several years. In the past, their business was quite good, and they routinely gave a "knocking reward" of twenty gold coins to the local ruffians and hooligans during festivals, and they have coexisted peacefully. Now that the Yaoer brothel is in the chrysanthemum mountain season, a time of booming business, the local hooligans went the day before yesterday to collect their twenty gold coin "gratuity." Gu only offered five yuan in banknotes, citing a sluggish market and poor business, and stating that they could only reduce the fee for now and would make up the difference when business improved. Unexpectedly, the hooligans refused, and the two sides had a quarrel and parted on bad terms. Around ten o'clock that night, more than ten hooligans, each wielding iron and wooden sticks as weapons, rushed to the brothel and started a violent attack, destroying the furniture and belongings in the parlor and rooms, and severely injuring Gu and his wife in the head, face, waist, and other parts of their bodies. After a patron reported the incident by telephone, the French police station immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives in police cars. The thugs had already scattered and fled, but they only managed to arrest Yu Jixiang (nicknamed "Little Yellow Fish," 27 years old) from Ningbo. He was taken to the police station, where he confessed the names of more than ten accomplices, including Zhang Yiru, Shen Awu, Dai Linshu, Tao Sansan, and others. Yesterday, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Attorney Yao Zhaodi of the Police Department explained the case, stating that it was necessary to arrest the accomplices still at large, requesting a postponement of the investigation before filing a complaint for trial. The victims, Gu Jixiang and Gu Fan, a married couple, did not appear due to their injuries. Judge Zhang Minsheng questioned the defendant once and ordered a retrial at a later date. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

Recently, the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested Song Laisheng, a native of Pudong, who confessed that Li Aming from Ningbo, residing at No. 60 Maigen Road, and Wang Fengchun from Ningbo, residing at No. 17, Lane 408, Yuanfang Road, were the main culprits in the case, providing firearms and participating in the robbery. After the incident, he received one hundred yuan in currency, a gold watch, and a gold ring. On the 22nd of last month, detectives, accompanied by the robber Song, surrendered to the two police stations on Jiaxing Road in Hongkou, which dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to secretly investigate and arrest Li and Wang at their addresses.

<p>Since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, various industries have been sluggish and unable to maintain operations. The reason is that housing is too expensive and unbearable. The Chinese Residents Association of the Public Concession and the United Citizens' Association of the First Special District believe that the French Concession has implemented the collection of empty house taxes, which is sufficient to reduce rents. Therefore, they successively suggested that the Shanghai Municipal Council follow suit to seek the revival of the market. After receiving the letter, the Shanghai Municipal Council replied to the United Citizens' Association of the First Special District yesterday, stating: "We acknowledge your letter of November 20th regarding the collection of empty house taxes in the French Concession. We believe that your association has some misunderstandings about this matter. According to our information, if vacant houses in the French Concession that are for rent have furniture and equipment, half of the tax will be waived. Vacant houses without such equipment are not subject to tax. Within the Public Concession, vacant houses with such equipment are still subject to the full tax. This is our response."</p>

<p>Hua Shihao, courtesy name Zhaokun, a native of Hubei residing at No. 51 Jiaheli, Lane 81, Hedder Road, was a boxing instructor at the National Martial Arts Hall in Jiujiang County. No. 46 in the same lane is the clubhouse of the Hubei Native Place Association, so Hua often went there to play. Due to gambling issues, he had a feud with Yang Hanzhang, a native of Hubei living in the Native Place Association, and they were incompatible. On the night of the 21st of this month, Yang hid two axes and ambushed Hua Shihao at the entrance of Jiaheli Lane. When Hua Shihao arrived, he drew the axe and struck Hua's head several times, causing Hua to fall to the ground with injuries. Yang fled with the axe to the intersection of Foch Road and Haig Road, where he was arrested by Indian Constable No. 311 along with the murder weapon. They were taken to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, and Hua Shihao was sent to Renji Hospital. Due to the severity of his injuries, he died despite medical treatment. Yang Hanzhang was escorted to the First Special Court for interrogation and custody. Yesterday morning, Judge Chuan Lin came to the Eighth Criminal Court to continue the interrogation. According to police attorney Wang Yaotang, he was charged with murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, the defendant Yang Hanzhang confessed that he had no feud with the deceased Hua Shihao, but he and Zhang Dongshan and Zhang Yunshan had disagreements over collecting commissions for gambling. Zhang and others then asked Hua Shihao for help, and Hua became deeply hostile to him, using his strength to intimidate him, causing him to not dare to go to the Native Place Association to stay for several days. On the night of the 21st of this month, he carried an axe, intending to return to the association. Unexpectedly, he met Hua Shihao in the lane. Hua immediately drew a nine-section whip and said, "Good fellow, you've come?" After speaking, he struck at him. He then met the attack with the axe. The nine-section whip wrapped around the axe. After he pulled hard, he also used another axe to wound his head. At that time, Zhang Dongshan and others also arrived and made things difficult for him. He had no choice but to escape and report to the Indian constable, and so on. Under the compulsory defense of lawyer Fan Gang assigned by the court, the defendant was ordered to be remanded in custody pending judgment next Monday.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Middle School Principals' Association Issues Declaration of Establishment <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Middle School Principals' Association was officially established the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the association issued the following declaration of establishment: In the face of intensifying international conflicts and the exchange of Chinese national revival movements, the position of the education community is becoming increasingly important, and the responsibilities it bears are also becoming increasingly heavy. We should respond to the needs of the times and seek fundamental reforms in the education undertaking. Thus, this association has been established. After the establishment, how to make education practice have a positive expression, how to make the direction of young people's lives have serious and reasonable guidance, how to make the education undertaking have a close connection with society and the country, and become a vibrant and brilliant education, the future facts can answer. Now, we will reveal the four points that this association plans to strive for to inform the people of the country:</p>
<p>We need national culture (1) Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated the New Life Movement, some people have advocated the Chinese-based cultural construction movement. The premise of the two is what is called "not adhering to the old" and "not blindly following." But what exactly is Chinese-based culture has not yet been concluded. We believe that culture is the general expression of a country's people striving for survival. What China should strive for now is, of course, the economic construction of the Three Principles of the People, but to achieve this goal, there must be two prerequisites: the invasion of imperialism is internal, namely, the loss of national spirit. Therefore, the essence of the culture that China needs, although economic, its starting point is nationalism. The education undertaking is a part of cultural construction. It bears the task of pioneering, cultivating the foundation, and deepening the source in the overall system of national culture. It should undoubtedly stand on the basis of nationalism, temper the fighting spirit of young people, and give play to the inherent ability of the nation. Externally, we should seek the freedom and equality of the country. Internally, we should seek the regeneration and development of the national economy. This is the first point we need to strive for. We should cultivate national defense education (2) The quality of education depends on whether it can meet the needs of reality. The Chinese national revival movement should, of course, be considered from a long-term perspective, but the situation of the confrontation between the two fronts of peace and aggression has become sharp and expanded. The total outbreak of the world crisis is imminent. China is under the dual pressure of the political and military forces of strong enemies. The life of the nation and the peace of the Far East are in danger. In fact, it is no longer a time to calmly build and talk and laugh to retreat from the enemy. In recent years, the government has made great determination for national defense construction and has made significant achievements. However, this responsibility must be borne jointly by the government and the people. The education community is responsible and cannot shirk it. Therefore, the current stage of school education should cultivate spiritual national defense in the field of social sciences, and in the field of natural sciences, it should, according to its nature, do its best to engage in the research and production of national defense preparations. In terms of management and training, it should be absolutely militarized. Not only should it develop the habits of hard work, endurance, meticulousness, and speed, but also pay attention to the exercises of combat, rescue, intelligence, propaganda, poison prevention, and air defense at all times. Even a question or a competition must contain the meaning of national defense. This is the second point we need to strive for. Integrate education with life (3) Education and life are mutually causal, that is, one has to receive education for the sake of life, and only the promotion of education can make social life continuously improve and move forward. Leaving life, except for a part of outstanding young people who can adapt to social life, the rest not only have no entrepreneurial ability, but also face obstacles everywhere in employment. Thus, a large number of graduating young people are trapped in an atmosphere of unemployment and hunger and cannot extricate themselves. This phenomenon, of course, has economic and political reasons, and the implementation of education and the late festival of social life are not one of the reasons. In recent years, vocational education has been put into practice from theory, but most middle schools have not changed their course. In schools of vocational education, although the disciplines have gradually approached the profession, in fact, they are still not linked to vocational institutions, and vocational institutions do not seem to attach importance to vocational education. As for the daily life of students, it is even more isolated from society and lacks general social experience and knowledge. This is the third point we need to strive for.</p>
<p>Lead the education community in the aid-Suiyuan movement (4) The importance of Suiyuan in national defense is clear to everyone. If Suiyuan is lost, the provinces of North China cannot be guaranteed, and even the entire China is in danger of becoming a colony. On the enemy's side, in order to complete its established policy of encircling Outer Mongolia and invading North China, it is determined to seize Suiyuan. The government has launched a national liberation war to protect national survival and territorial integrity. Tens of thousands of loyal soldiers of the country have fought bloody battles on the snowy front and have shown their power, repeatedly defeating strong enemies and capturing Bailingmiao, the base of the bandits. Now, the people of the whole country have risen up to respond, saving on food and clothing to contribute to the front line. The development of public sentiment and the strength of the military force are all symbols of national revival. The education community is in the leading position of young people, and it should use all its talents and resources to advocate for it. This is the fourth point we need to strive for. The above four points are all efforts that this association should make in the future. We will not shirk our responsibility and will certainly achieve our goals. We vow to move forward with the great fearless spirit of Premier Sun and the hard-working creed shown by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. We hope that the education authorities and people from all walks of life will give us guidance and supervision so as to increase our effectiveness. We are very fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e204">American Philosopher, Mr. Alexander, Sympathizes with Chinese Culture <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Hartlay B. Alexander, a professor at the Claremont Graduate University of Southern California, and a world-renowned philosopher, lectured on "National Culture and World Civilization" at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou. He is a former president of the American Philosophical Association and a director of the Southwestern Archaeological Society of America. He has also lectured at the University of Paris and has a wide range of academic interests. He initially worked as an editor for the Webster's Dictionary, and also authored two large volumes on North and South American mythology, as well as several volumes of poetry and drama. He has also written numerous commentaries on education, literary construction, and political philosophy. Additionally, he served as an editor for the "Encyclopedia of Philosophy" and the "World Book Encyclopedia". However, the core of his thinking is rooted in the ancient Greek philosopher Plato, and his sympathy for Chinese culture is based on this foundation. This year, at the age of sixty-three, he is energetic and shows no signs of aging. During his travels, he visited President Zhu Kezhen of National Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, as well as Mr. Mei Kedi, the head of the university's foreign language department, who invited him to give a lecture. Mr. Alexander then delivered a lecture at Zhejiang University on the 21st of this month, titled "National Culture and World Civilization," which included the following points: (1) China today needs modern science and mechanical construction, but it must be understood that the entirety of human life is more than just machinery. Mechanical life is only a part of human civilization. Westerners only know this partial aspect and cannot see the whole picture. In this regard, the wisdom of the Chinese people far surpasses that of Europeans and Americans, because Chinese people can pursue a complete human life encompassing truth, beauty, and goodness. (2) Any national culture is an expression of the creative life of the entire nation, each possessing unique and indelible value. Therefore, for the sake of the nation itself and for world civilization, each nation should always maintain and promote the unique characteristics of its inherent culture without losing them. Looking at the beautiful mountains and clear waters of West Lake, I am even more convinced of the greatness of this national creative power. If you continue to work hard, the world will benefit. (3) Monotony and uniformity kill vitality, whether for individuals or nations. What is valuable is mutual respect and mutual understanding, not necessarily becoming identical. Today's international misfortune stems from a lack of understanding. For example, Americans often misunderstand China, and at the same time, Chinese people also misunderstand America. To seek the welfare of the world, China and the United States must each maintain and promote their national strengths, respecting and befriending each other, just as each individual develops their talents and strengths without everyone needing to follow the same path. World civilization must be composed of the different and unique cultures of each nation. I hope that Chinese people who bear cultural responsibility will encourage each other to strive for this goal.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education believes that a large number of faculty members and students in elementary, middle, and high schools throughout Guangdong Province still use dialects, which greatly hinders the promotion of national language education compared to other provinces. The Ministry has therefore formulated a five-point outline of measures for promoting national language education in the province, and has telegraphed the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education to develop detailed measures based on this outline and implement them diligently. The original provisions are copied and recorded below: (1) Urge teachers at all levels of schools in the province to teach entirely in the national language. (Inspectors should report on whether teachers at all levels of schools are teaching in the national language, and this should be included in the performance evaluation of each school.) (2) Current Chinese language teachers in normal schools, middle schools, and elementary schools who are unable to teach in the national language should be required by the Department of Education to study within a specified time period. Upon completion, they will be assessed. Those who are able to teach in the national language will be exempt from study and will be directly issued a certificate. (3) Establish national language training centers in important and convenient locations, requiring teachers at all levels of schools who cannot teach in the national language to study in phases. (4) Starting from the 26th academic year, the normal school entrance examination subjects will include national language oral proficiency and phonetic symbols. (5) Starting from the 27th academic year, the examination for elementary school teachers should include national language oral proficiency and phonetic symbols.</p>

<p>The faculty and students of the Shanghai Business College of the Great China University, the Shanghai Yuemingyuan Road, and the Business College of Soochow University's downtown campus have always been enthusiastic about patriotic movements. Since the suppression of bandits in Suiyuan, the faculty and students of the college, recognizing the urgency of providing assistance and慰劳, have promoted Sunday sports, each Sunday unanimously reducing spending on leisure activities. As of the 30th of this month, the college has raised a total of 225 yuan, 3 jiao, and 4 fen for supporting and慰劳ing Suiyuan, which has been remitted to the Joint Committee for慰劳ing and Aiding the Suppression of Bandits in Suiyuan, organized by the Bank of China and three other associations, to be distributed to the front lines. Fundraising is continuing.</p>

<p>Recently, Xinmin Elementary School and 46 other municipal schools jointly submitted a request to the Bureau of Social Affairs, stating that a small number of municipal school staff members, including Qian Xuanqing, had organized the Shanghai Municipal School Staff Union without prior notice to Xinmin and the other 46 schools. Furthermore, the union had not been permitted or registered by party and government agencies and did not comply with legal procedures. Therefore, they requested a ban to avoid disputes. After receiving the request, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs stated that the organization of civic groups must, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Civic Group Organization Plan, be permitted by local party headquarters at all levels and reported to the government before organizational activities can be carried out. The union had not gone through the aforementioned legal procedures and therefore violated the law. Moreover, the city already had organizations such as the Elementary School Educators' Union, making it unnecessary to establish another organization. A ban was therefore issued and publicly announced.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously stated that Item 3 of the "Explanation of the Scope of Civil Servants and the Calculation Method of Their Salary Income Tax Amount" stipulated that faculty and staff of national, provincial, municipal, and county schools should fall under the scope of civil servants. However, it was not clearly defined whether faculty and staff of private schools fall under the scope of "other persons engaged in public service according to laws and regulations" or under the scope of independent professions. Therefore, the Provincial Government requested a reply from the Ministry of Finance. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has now received a reply from the Ministry of Finance, which states that the income of faculty and staff of national, provincial, municipal, and county schools is paid from the national or local treasury and should be taxed as civil servants starting in October of this year. However, since the source of income for faculty and staff of private schools is different, they will be taxed as independent professionals starting in January of next year. After receiving the reply, the Jiangsu Provincial Government instructed the Department of Education to comply.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Blue Culture Street <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Sima Road is known as Shanghai's Culture Street because it is a hub for bookstores. However, a certain Bazhi Road in Hongkou District also carries the same connotation. From Wenhua Book Company at the intersection of North Sichuan Road to North Henan Road, the west part of Bazhi Road is not long. However, there are no less than twenty schools along the road and nearby, including elementary schools and foreign language training schools. Each school has three to four hundred students, or at least dozens, adding up to a considerable number.</p>
<p>When both hands of the clock point upwards, it is time for school to dismiss at noon. Students on the road, male and female, big and small, suddenly crowd the street. Looking from afar, one only sees the swaying of blue, for half an hour. This kind of liveliness cannot be seen on other roads, not even on the university street in Jiangwan.</p>
<p>Perhaps blue is neither too bright nor too dull, aligning with the so-called "doctrine of the mean." Naturally, I love the innocence and vitality of students, their forward momentum, and I also love their blue shirts.</p>
<p>I often stroll along Bazhi Road, especially at noon. Walking through the cultural street of Hongkou District among the students, I cannot help but recite: "Students scatter at noon, blue shirts fill the street."</p>
<h3 id="e216">Lujiawan Bridge <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Tianxi</p>
<p>Lujiawan Bridge is located in the middle of Xiexu Road in Nanshi. Five or six years ago, one could still see the wooden bridge. In recent years, the local authorities filled it in, and there is no trace of the bridge anymore. As a result, pedestrians only know of Lujiawan, but not of Lujiawan Bridge.</p>
<p>Before it was filled in, underneath the Lujiawan Bridge was a filthy and smelly mud pool. Every summer, the waste accumulated in the pool over time was exposed to strong sunlight, making people feel dizzy. Therefore, pedestrians regarded it as a path to be avoided.</p>
<p>Originally, the area was very desolate a dozen years ago. Later, the landowners built houses on most of the nearby vacant land, and the number of residents gradually increased, turning it into a bustling working-class area. With so many residents, there was naturally a need to fill in the useless and foul-smelling pool. Therefore, the municipal authorities ordered the Public Works Bureau to find a way to fill it in. The Public Works Bureau used garbage and other waste to accumulate it day by day. It has now been filled in to the west of Lujiawan Bridge. It is expected that soon, even the waste pools at Dapu Bridge, Da Mu Bridge, Fenglin Bridge and other places will be filled in, creating a garbage road.</p>
<p>In the past, transportation in the Lujiawan Bridge area relied on French Route 10 and Route 6 trams. As a result, the China Merchants Tram Company had plans to build a line directly to Xujiawan to prevent external interests from encroaching. However, the waste pool could not be filled in for a while, so it has not yet been realized. Later, the Public Bus Company, sponsored by the Municipal Public Utility Bureau, opened up a route, which began to take away part of the business.</p>
<p>Now that this area has been filled in, it naturally gives those unemployed and poor people a good opportunity until the government authorities announce what it will be used for. At first, there were only people placing manure carts and fortune-tellers setting up stalls to write letters for people. Later, poor people nearby saw that the filled-in area was suitable for setting up stalls, so they contacted the local hooligans and bullies and asked them for protection, with all expenses paid by the poor people on a daily basis. Once this trend started, it was as if people who travel around selling goods came after hearing the news. More and more stalls were set up every day.</p>
<p>From Lujiawan Bridge to Xieqiao, one only sees crowds of people. What comes into view are all stalls. The liveliness is no less than that of the City God Temple. The most numerous are the second-hand stalls, followed by character-breaking stalls, miscellaneous goods stalls, snack stalls, plaster stalls, miscellaneous disease clinics, shoe stalls, martial arts performances, and so on. All kinds of stalls that travel around the world are available.</p>
<p>There was a time when these many stalls were banned by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, but later, somehow, these stalls reappeared in a few days, presumably because someone had lobbied the authorities. In short, although Lujiawan Bridge is now forgotten by people, the poor people who rely on filling in the Lujiawan Bridge to earn a living should commemorate this Lujiawan Bridge.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Yangshupu at Night <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Zheng</p>
<p>The god of night stretches out its giant arm, grasping the entire pulse of Yangshupu; the street lights emit a dim light, trams, cars, public buses, rickshaws, small carts, rickshaws, and Japanese military trucks come and go in a constant stream. But for the time being, this is just a flash in the pan!</p>
<p>Although this place is not as luxurious as Nanjing Road, nor as mysterious as Fourth Road, nor as exotic as Avenue Joffre, it also has the same popular touch as Robison Road—the base camp for the working masses and people struggling to make a living—therefore, in the evening, especially at dusk, all the factories here successively release a group of pale-faced and mentally exhausted male and female workers, and at the same time take in a group of thin and haggard men and women working the night shift. For the sake of survival, they do not hesitate to toil all day and take the lowest price.</p>
<p>Maybe it's to find excitement! No! They lack knowledge, so demeaning and teasing of women will come out of their mouths at any time:</p>
<p>"Little sister! Want to go to a room?"</p>
<p>"Elder sister! Want to have some fun?"</p>
<p>But those who are called "little sister" will resist and curse the teasers:</p>
<p>"May you be struck by a thousand knives!" "Pig!"</p>
<p>"Be careful of the tram running you over (to death)!"</p>
<p>Some are in the factory by the foreman's meanness and insults, and in addition to sighing that they have a bad fate, what other way can they think of? Because they need to eat, they have to let people slaughter them, forever slaughter them!</p>
<p>These are daily homework, the only ornaments of Yangshupu every night.</p>
<p>When the short hand of the clock turns to 10 on Albert Road, the whole of Yangshupu is dead, and there is simply no moan. Next to its corpse are only sleepy policemen and the sound of wonton sellers, as well as those who take the risk for survival. (A vicious term for undressing people in the dead of night).</p>
<p>The night in Yangshupu finally disappeared in this way!</p>

<p>— Fan Xuehui</p>
<p>Xingsheng Street, if people have no connection to it, of course they won't know it, but I believe those women will not be without an impression of it; because this is indeed the only small street in Shanghai that sells wool yarn, so there are also the most wool yarn shops here, and there are also quite a few paint shops in addition. This narrow street, in terms of its commercial position in the French Concession, is probably one of the best.</p>
<p>Every spring, merchants from the mainland come to Shanghai to buy goods, and it is essential for them to come here, as commodities such as wool yarn and paint can probably only be sold here, and are not easy to find elsewhere.</p>
<p>So at that time, there were Jiangbei merchants wearing melon skin hats and blue long gowns, who were foolish and simple. There are merchants from Jiangsu and Zhejiang who are slick in their actions and articulate. There are also northern merchants who are generous in their wheel prices and have eccentric tempers who come here to buy goods.</p>
<p>When the north wind howls, deep autumn is about to pass, and the god in charge of winter comes with severe cold. At that time, the scene on Xingsheng Street seems to have changed its face again, like the Women's Kingdom in "Flowers in the Mirror," coming and going, bustling with women. This is the time to buy wool yarn and make winter clothes. There are bourgeois women, young female students in teams of three or five carrying small leather briefcases. There are female workers, and so-called artistic actors and stars also come, as well as Pudong-style women who carry vegetables in the morning and sell them along the street.</p>
<p>They squeeze into the doorways of every wool yarn shop, take the wool yarn, and slowly deliberate on which color is suitable for themselves. By the night of the re-emergence of spring, this place has also returned to its original appearance.</p>
<p>I have stepped into this small street for more than ten years. In the past, they were very simple, but now, every wool yarn shop has actually installed a three-dimensional large glass window, displaying colorful and eye-catching wool yarn. This is undoubtedly an image of commercial competition and economic bankruptcy.</p>
<p>In the past few days, this place has been filled with shouting and noise all day long. After the god of night pulls the gray veil together, it gradually becomes quiet; but the music and singing of the dancing hall on Zhu Bao San Road occupy our eardrums again.</p>

<p>Eighth Episode: Vows Exchanged Over a Cup of Water, Faded Thoughts Under the Green Lamp; Gold-Embroidered Fingers Declare Yearning with Red Beans</p>
<p>This was too good; his bitterness had finally come to an end. He didn't hide from his friend and was willing to give him something that symbolized love between a man and a woman. If this continued, he would surely reach the pinnacle of love. He had already forgotten the heat and wore the ring on his little finger, then slowly stroked it with his hand. He didn't know how long he had been imagining this, but when he looked up out the window, the sun was already gone from the courtyard. He felt extremely happy at this moment, feeling that everything in the universe was lovely. It wasn't too hot, so he decided to visit his friend and have a good talk. He didn't hesitate, put on his long gown and straw hat, and went out. The ring on his little finger wasn't removed either. On the street, he looked at every young man he saw, wondering if they were engaged or married. If they weren't engaged, they couldn't imagine the joy of being engaged. When he saw women, he thought that he didn't need to envy them anymore, because the most beautiful, virtuous, and capable woman in the world belonged to him. As he thought this, a smile kept appearing on his face. People on the road saw his expression and couldn't figure out what was wrong with this young man. He was very refined and composed, so why was he smiling while walking? He himself didn't understand any of this, he just kept walking. When he felt a bit more open space in front of him, he looked up and saw a row of city walls, and below the walls, a vegetable garden. In it were two ponds with tall reeds, and a few sparse willows with two pavilions nestled among them. Oh, this was Bailuzhou (White Heron Isle) in the east of the city. Why had he come here? He looked at the sky again and saw red clouds on half the sky, reflecting off the blue sky in the pond. Crows were constantly flying across the sky. Well, it wouldn't hurt to play around at Bailuzhou. The evening scenery was very beautiful. As he walked, he wondered if he was being too happy. Maybe there was a reason for this. Would Menglan really ask Youmei to handle such a secret matter? Besides, Youmei had never mentioned it before. And today's attitude was also suspicious. This change of mind made him feel disheartened, so he decided not to visit Bailuzhou and turned around to head back. He had been very relaxed when he came, but now he walked extremely fast on the way back. When he got home, it was naturally dark, and the lamp was lit. Under the lamplight, it was very clear that a copper ruler was holding down a letter. The bottom of the letter said "Today," and was signed "MN." Could this already be a key, unlocking Guoqi's lock of worries? He didn't sit down at the time, but impatiently started reading. (104)</p>

<p>— Jiao Shijie</p>
<p>Cutting across the middle of Shanghai, from east to west, this winding stream of water, as black as mud, meanders and twists, dividing Shanghai into two areas: the south bank is the Concession, and the north bank is called Zhabei. It also separates two classes of people. Those who live in the Concession are mostly wealthy merchants, rich gentlemen, extravagant young masters, and fashionable beautiful girls. These are considered the upper class(?). Those who live in Zhabei are common laborers, hardworking workers, peddlers, and drifters. They live in thatched huts and eat simple food like pancakes and sweet potatoes, which is, of course, not comparable to the upper class(?) people who live in Western-style houses in the Concession and eat fine food. Therefore, they can only be called the lower class! However, in this lower-class area, the forces of a certain kind of people are lurking, constantly showing affection and threatening. The poor people are crying out in pain. This seems to divide the classes even more clearly. On this river, countless boats come and go every day. The whistling sound of small steamships and the black smoke constantly fill the river. This is the Suzhou Creek that everyone in Shanghai knows.</p>
<p>The Suzhou Creek enjoys great fame due to its location, but after the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, it divided the war zone and the non-war zone, making its position even more important and its reputation doubled. The current Suzhou Creek is like an ancient "moat." During the January 28th Incident, Zhabei was reduced to scorched earth, while the south of the Suzhou Creek remained untouched. Refugees who escaped across the Suzhou Creek felt like they had reached a safe haven. Life and death were separated by just one river. At that time, the Suzhou Creek could be called the "River of Life and Death."</p>
<p>There are more than a dozen bridges on the Suzhou Creek. The most modern and grand steel bridge is the Waibaidu Bridge (Garden Bridge) and the Old Rubbish Bridge. Countless trams and cars pass over them every day, yet they remain unmoved. It is difficult to estimate how much pressure they can withstand. Other steel and concrete bridges include the Libaidu Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, Tianhougong Bridge, and New Rubbish Bridge, all lying quietly on the river. The other wooden bridges are also quite sturdy and can bear the responsibility of transportation, fulfilling their duties happily!</p>
<p>The eastern end of the Suzhou Creek connects with the Huangpu River. On the left is a twenty-story building, and on the right is the Bund Park, like two giant stone lions guarding the entrance, decorating the Suzhou Creek in a spectacular way. At the intersection of Sichuan Road is the Shanghai Postal Administration, dark and majestic, with an ancient atmosphere. Especially in the area east of the Xinzha Bridge, many tall buildings are banks' warehouses and depots. On the banks of the river, like a long snake formation, are arranged dung carts, and a peculiar stench spreads with the flow of air.</p>
<p>West of the Xinzha Bridge, it gradually transitions into a slum area. Here are small thatched huts, huddled together with families of men and women, most of whom are from Jiangbei. The men make a living by pulling rickshaws, and the women go out to do needlework, mending clothes and socks for others. The children also work collecting garbage. In the hot summer, you can see naked children, like Little Sanzi and Little Liuzi. In winter, they shiver in the northwest wind. All year round, the stench of the river, the smell of feces, and the smell of people constantly enter their breath.</p>
<p>Such is the scenery on the Suzhou Creek.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Xujiahui at Dusk <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Xiafei</p>
<p>In the evening, shrouded in the setting sun, we dragged three uneven shadows, swaying and staggering back to Xujiahui. It was a place not far from the city but with a touch of rural flavor. There, we could see many dilapidated thatched huts in slums, and also villas with small Western-style houses. There were churches, schools, young male and female students, children picking up dead branches, leisurely gentlemen, wives, young masters, and young ladies; there were crowds struggling below in hell, preachers carrying crosses, unemployed people wandering in the streets, fat heads, hungry faces: There was… this other side of the city, a convergence of joy, suffering, tranquility, and noise.</p>
<p>The leaves of the French plane trees fluttered in the air like flying butterflies. Two or three tourists loitered by the roadside, but their faces seemed a bit melancholy. The roof of the church stood tall like two pen tips. The setting sun shone on the cross on the spire, emitting a metallic glow that trembled in the air.</p>
<p>Just as we circled around the church, suddenly a strange smell wafted over from the evening breeze. We quickly covered our noses and fled into a narrow alley. The green shade overhead in that vertical narrow alley blocked the sky, and the twilight of the setting sun slipped in, creating a Western oil painting-like color tone.</p>
<p>After passing through Tushanwan, we crossed a small bridge and seemed to enter a desolate village. The surrounding area was all fields, although there were some clusters of village houses, and even flowing water, plank bridges, dogs barking, and chickens crowing, but it seemed sparsely populated. In front of the Lianhua Film Company's studio, a large group of people were gathered, craning their necks to look at the sky. So, we also curiously looked up at the sky, and saw a small object climbing very fast in the blue sky. Its tail seemed to be spitting out a white smoke, and it instantly formed four English letters: C.N.A.C.</p>
<p>"Airplane writing." I remembered seeing something like an aerial advertisement in some foreign films, where a small airplane flew in the sky and wrote smoke letters.</p>
<p>Next to the Lianhua studio, we took the opportunity to visit the Asian Bee Farm and talked a lot about beekeeping experiences with General Deng Bingshan. He said: Beekeeping is indeed a sideline that urgently needs to be promoted in our country, especially near orchards, because it is not only beneficial to flowers and fruits, but also because of the abundance of honey sources, the honey production is also excellent. In modern times, honey has a wide range of uses. No matter in candy, medicine, cosmetics, or cigarettes, honey is indispensable. According to current customs statistics, the annual import of foreign honey amounts to millions, but our country is still missing out on the benefits of this great sideline. Coming out of the Asian Bee Farm, we originally wanted to visit the Lianhua studio, but it was too late, so we looked for the road back home.</p>
<p>"The setting sun is infinitely good, it's just near dusk." I felt infinite nostalgia and regret for this vast spring scenery!</p>

<h3 id="e223">Random Notes on the Family Hygiene Status of Villagers in the Qimei Road Civilian Village, Shanghai <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Li Caihua</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>The term "Civilian Village" is familiar to people, right? It is one of the constructions of Greater Shanghai. The Qimei Road Civilian Village is in a corner of the Shanghai countryside, but its economic structure is still inseparable from the economic structure of the metropolis of Shanghai; therefore, every movement is closely related. I have written two articles, one is the statistics of children's deaths, published in this newspaper in June, and the other is a survey of women recently published in the Central Daily News. What I want to write now is the family hygiene status of the villagers, because the goodness of family hygiene is closely related to the health of each member of the family. A hygienic family can directly promote the well-being of the family population and the soundness of the family organization; indirectly, it can help to consolidate the foundation of the country and cure a part of the diseases of the society. If we want to improve their family life, we must pay attention to family hygiene.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>There are a total of two hundred and fifty families in our village. According to the length of time the households have lived here, some have just moved in, and some have moved in since February of this year! In the past ten months, we have been investigating their family hygiene status before they moved into the village, while also paying attention to their current family hygiene status, and at the same time implementing hygiene education. Now, I will summarize it into two parts: one is the family hygiene status outside the village (referring to before moving into the village), and the other is the family hygiene status inside the village (referring to after moving into the village, including new and old households).</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>(I) Family Hygiene Status Outside the Village</p>
<p>According to the reports of the village households' conversations and the results of the survey, the following is the case:</p>
<p>(1) Those living in front buildings account for 7%, back buildings account for 13%, kitchen sheds account for 41%, attic rooms account for 33%, and back living rooms account for 6%. (2) Those living in the concessions (public concession) account for 67%, and those in the city (Zhabei) account for 33%. (3) Those with rent of four to six yuan account for more than 80%, and those with rent of seven to twelve yuan account for less than 20%. (4) They do not fold quilts or tidy beds. (5) The furniture and objects in the room are messy. (6) Snot and phlegm can be seen everywhere. (7) The room is small and crowded, the air is stifled, and there is little sunlight. (8) The kitchen, bedroom, and toilet are connected together. (9) Doors and windows are often closed. (10) The tables and chairs are covered with dust, and fruit peels and paper scraps are thrown everywhere. (11) The whole family sleeps in one room.</p>
<p>Looking at the above report, we can draw the following conclusions:</p>
<p>Items 4, 5, 6, 9, and 10 are habit problems; the rest are economic problems.</p>
<p>(II) Family Hygiene Status Inside the Village</p>
<p>We will analyze the family hygiene status inside the village based on the above two conclusions.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about economic problems—it can be said that there are no problems anymore. The appearance and interior of the Class A and Class B residences in this village are the same throughout the village. The bedroom, living room, kitchen, storage room, and toilet are all clearly separated. The direction of the houses is uniformly facing south, naturally with plenty of sunlight. There are large sports fields, wide roads, and various new-style sanitary facilities here, so the problems caused by economics are no longer problems.</p>
<p>As for habit problems—indeed, the newly arrived villagers still have unhygienic habits. We often see that when they first move in, the ground is covered with fruit peels, paper scraps, and phlegm. The placement of furniture and objects is also inappropriate; the quilts and clothes on the bed are often piled together in a mess; the doors and windows are always tightly closed; and there are still traces of dust on the tables and chairs. In short, it is not much different from the unhygienic situation outside the village. However, after two or three months, it is different, and this is not without reason:</p>
<p>(1) There is a group life—the families are very connected, and the feelings are becoming increasingly close, unlike when they lived outside the village, where tenants in the same residence rarely interacted. Here, the Zhang family goes to the Li family, the Li family goes to the Wang family, new households go to old households, and old households go to new households, coming and going frequently. An assimilation effect and competitive psychology have developed invisibly; therefore, unhygienic habits have also been reduced a lot invisibly. This is the first reason.</p>
<p>(2) Infusion of hygiene education—we often hold hygiene education lectures, fully infusing common hygiene knowledge; we also constantly post popular hygiene slogans, pictures, and distribute leaflets, thus increasing their deep understanding of improving family hygiene. This is the second reason.</p>
<p>(3) Cleanliness inspection—we often go to their homes to chat and secretly check the cleanliness. When we encounter unhygienic situations, we give earnest advice. Therefore, going to their homes more often means creating more opportunities for them to improve. The more opportunities, the more significant the improvement. This is the third reason.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>As for the old households, the family hygiene status is improving day by day; at the same time, most have changed their past unhygienic habits, but the new households have not achieved this. In the future, we will let the old households take on the important responsibility of persuasion and propaganda. We will use this part of our time and energy to study how to improve the villagers' family life methods.</p>
<p>At the same time, I would like to tell the readers: when they lived outside the village, they often got sick. I think this is absolutely related to the quality of family hygiene, and it is directly proportional: to put it clearly, unhealthy families definitely have more sick people, and healthy families definitely have fewer sick people. If we were to investigate the material losses suffered by each family member nationwide due to illness, then this statistical math would definitely be very alarming.</p>
<p>We dare not be complacent because, due to the limitations of manpower and financial resources, we are still far from our ideal. Here, I sincerely and devoutly hope that those who care about social issues will always give their advice and guidance.</p>
<h3 id="e224">The Problem of Building the Nursing Profession in China Tomorrow (Part 2) <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Li Lingdong</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to reform nursing education and raise the nursing profession, we must start with the construction of the nursing education system. After graduating from senior nursing vocational schools, there can still be opportunities for further study. The establishment of academies for studying one's own career will make the nursing profession a specialized academic institution. Therefore, the establishment of nursing colleges or university-affiliated nursing departments, and various academic departments to study specialized fields, such as nursing administration, nursing technology, nursing education, nursing nutrition, public health nursing, psychiatric nursing, etc.</p>
<p>In this way, there will be no need for us to shout loudly that nursing is sacred and great. Colleagues engaged in the nursing profession will not despise themselves or have the distorted idea of wanting to become doctors. Society will no longer have the mistaken perception of "high-class tea servants," "caregivers," "nursing women," or "the most economical laborers in hospitals." The nursing profession is a specialized technology and a profession with profound knowledge that protects human health. This nursing education system, which urgently needs to be built and laid the foundation for, still hopes to achieve success as soon as possible in the initial sound of reforming nursing education, and establish a top nursing academy to raise the social status of the nursing profession.</p>
<p>Third, the establishment of nursing supervisors is an essential element of a sound organization.</p>
<p>When nursing education is being planned, the highest administrative organ of nursing education spares no effort to engage in construction and transformation for the development of nursing careers, planning and all facilities, to complete the ideal Chinese nursing career.</p>
<p>However, for this great construction project of the Chinese nursing career, how can the higher-level organs plan perfectly and design the implementation, if only relying on the higher-level organs? However, the unit that bears the mission of completing the nurse's new education – the nursing school. If they do not work according to the regulations and truly implement the new education, then it still cannot help the overall situation. Why do we only talk about the importance of nursing schools and not about the nurse's professional problems in society or the nurse's professional problems in hospitals? Because nursing school is the place for training nursing talents, the basic source of the nursing career. If there are defects in the cell organization of nursing students, even if they grow into an individual and become a successful nurse, they will still be a nurse with an unsound body and mind, harming the community. Therefore, the construction of nursing schools is extremely important for the construction of the nursing career. Then, is there supervision of whether nursing schools are working reliably? We can also answer without a doubt that it is an even more important matter.</p>
<p>Therefore, the establishment of the nursing supervisor system is to supervise whether nursing schools are working thoroughly and sincerely, a prescription of the right medicine for the disease. Because often higher-level authorities have strict and comprehensive business plans, but lower-level subordinates often feign compliance and do not implement the work according to the promulgated procedures, some are confused, and some are fraudulent. All the work becomes written articles, written reports, and higher-level organs cannot know the situation and have no way to investigate. Work efficiency and business progress will never reach the day of development, so the function of the establishment of nursing supervisors should be generated according to needs, which can connect the upper and lower parties, communicate them, and increase administrative efficiency. The importance of the supervisory system is evident in this respect, and it is indeed a problem worth studying.</p>
<p>Fourth, the reform of the nursing curriculum is the blueprint for the construction project.</p>
<p>Regarding the curriculum reform issue, the first step is to discuss the nursing school nursing student ward internship problem. Nursing student ward internships are more important than any other vocational school internship because the object of the nursing profession is to seek the happiness of patients and relieve their suffering. Occasional negligence in the details will cause the patient's life to suffer great sacrifice. Therefore, the entire technology that is learned must be practiced, practiced, and observed in the ward, to learn how to engage in nursing work and procedures.</p>
<p>However, what is the current situation of nursing student internships? Most of them are working in the ward while studying. In the earliest grades, the internship time is three or four hours a day, and then gradually increases. The higher the grade, the more time is spent, or even more than ten hours a day. We have always opposed this system because it contains great malpractices and dangers.</p>
<p>Because when working in the ward, the work encountered has not yet been taught in the curriculum. The efficacy, method, and disadvantages of this technology are not known at all. We ask nursing students to implement this technology to serve patients. We think that if they do this blindly, patients will not get the benefit of the technical value, and nursing students will not be able to achieve the purpose of learning to work.</p>
<p>Also, due to the allocation of class time, coming and going to the ward, the situation of the ward work and the progress of the patient's symptoms cannot be thoroughly understood. Re-examining the study of medical records cannot show the spirit of nurse service, or their loyalty to their work. Therefore, it is uneconomical in terms of time, and there is no possibility of progress in the learning efficiency of nursing students.</p>

<h3 id="e225">Joining the Shantytowns of the Jiangsu Provincial Capital to Administer Vaccinations (Continued) <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Baishui</p>
<p>(4) Superstition runs deep. People believe that by hanging a red cloth strip on their heads with the words "Smallpox Passed" written on it and praying a few words before a wooden idol, they can avoid smallpox and are unwilling to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>(5) They believe that vaccination can trigger fetal toxins, so children are always vaccinated only when they are three or four years old. They also say that in children under two years old, fetal toxins cannot be released.</p>
<p>(6) They believe that because it is a charitable endeavor, the vaccine must not be of high quality, and they often refuse to accept it. In families with limited means, they also feel uneasy about something that is free, not realizing that everyone has already contributed to these medical expenses, and everyone has the benefit of receiving free vaccinations.</p>
<p>(7) When they are unwilling to accept vaccinations, no matter how long you talk, they will still lower their heads, doing their work, or answer "Yes... Yes..." perfunctorily, perhaps not even hearing what you are saying. If you continue to talk, you might just get a cold shoulder.</p>
<p>(8) In this rising tide of rural bankruptcy and increasing unemployment, the general lower classes are truly too poor. They cannot survive without working, and it is not easy to achieve even basic sustenance. Add to that their stubborn thinking that vaccination requires eating "hot" foods and avoiding certain foods. Where would they get the money to buy these "hot" foods? Therefore, they make excuses and are unwilling to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>(9) In private schools crowded with many children, when you contact them about vaccination, before you finish speaking, the teachers always say without thinking: "...You are truly working hard, coming out to vaccinate people in this cold weather. It's truly a kind gesture, but all the students here have already been vaccinated. Thank you for your kindness..." Are they telling the truth? If you ask them further, they might say, "However, we can't get schools here, the students can't get vaccinated themselves because their parents entrust the children to my care, and I bear a great responsibility. If you insist on vaccinating these children, feel free, but let me notify their parents tonight. Those who are willing to be vaccinated can then notify you, and then we will bother you!" Do they really go to each parent to encourage vaccination? Will they notify you later? Many untrained private school teachers only know how to teach children dead knowledge, placing the children's health far beyond their concerns.</p>
<p>Insights from Research</p>
<p>(1) Before vaccination, explain that cowpox vaccination does not require avoiding certain foods or eating "hot" foods. This can dispel the mindset of those who are poor and cannot afford "hot" foods and are therefore unwilling to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>(2) When making rounds for vaccination, it is advisable to use the pressure-prick method (using a needle to prick the epidermis to allow the vaccine to enter). This is because the equipment is easy to sterilize and economical. Using the mouth to blow the vaccine onto the skin is unhygienic. You can use a five-fen long rubber tube, pierce a small hole, cut off both ends of the vaccine, insert one end into the small hole in the rubber tube, and firmly close both ends of the rubber tube with your thumb and index finger, applying pressure to squeeze it. The air pressure in the tube will force the vaccine out from the other end.</p>
<p>(3) Everyone has a fear of pain, so this is especially important to pay attention to when vaccinating in large groups. If the first person says that vaccination is very painful, no second or third person will volunteer to be vaccinated. Therefore, the first person to be vaccinated should be someone more knowledgeable and robust. Before the injection, use people's competitive nature to first encourage their courage, for example, saying, "You are very brave. Actually, vaccination doesn't hurt at all, it's lighter than a mosquito bite! If you say it hurts, that person is too timid." After such suggestion and encouragement, even if it is painfully uncomfortable, they will endure it themselves, so they will pretend that it doesn't hurt, and will even automatically encourage others. Moreover, the actual vaccination is not as painful as an injection.</p>
<p>(4) The number of vaccinated men accounts for more than two-thirds, among which the number of women being vaccinated for the first time exceeds the number of revaccinations. The opposite is true for men. (Referring to shantytowns.)</p>
<p>(5) The age of vaccinated people: there are more people under ten years old than over ten years old. For women, the ratio of those over ten years old to those under ten years old is 1 to 10. For men, the ratio of those over ten years old to those under ten years old is 4 to 6. (Referring to shantytowns.)</p>
<p>(6) If people are unwilling to be vaccinated due to the cold weather and intend to get vaccinated in the spring of next year, if the advantages and disadvantages can be explained in detail, they can generally be persuaded to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>(7) For people who do not believe in vaccination and are blindly superstitious, even after a lot of time and detailed explanation, the results are still very small. Moreover, after you leave, they will still grumble and curse you for a while.</p>
<p>Concluding Remarks</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Capital has now started administering cowpox vaccinations, not only in the streets and markets but also extended to the lower-class shantytown areas. This spirit is worthy of admiration. It is hoped that other places will also start soon to eliminate traces of smallpox. Even then, we have not achieved what we hoped. Look again! In rural villages without sanitation facilities, the incidence of various infectious diseases is higher than in cities, and the mortality rate is very high, which is truly a danger to our country. Therefore, it is even more hoped that the health authorities will extend the work of administering cowpox vaccinations to rural villages where knowledge is shallow, superstition is deep, thinking is stubborn, and there are no sanitation facilities, so that every farmer can receive its benefits and get its protection. That is the fortune of our country's farmers, and it is what I have been yearning for and praying for day and night. (The End)</p>

<p>— Yan Fuqing</p>
<p>(9) Raising funds to build a sanatorium – Shanghai has a population of over 3.5 million, and based on statistics, the number of people suffering from tuberculosis is estimated to be around 200,000. However, there are fewer than 500 tuberculosis beds in all the hospitals in the city. Such a large city cannot even find a tuberculosis sanatorium. Patients suffering from tuberculosis have the suffering of having no place to be treated. In view of this, the Association has repeatedly wanted to raise funds to build a tuberculosis sanatorium. However, the cost is huge, and due to the economic downturn, it has not been successful. This year, we are pleased to celebrate Mr. Yu Qiaqing's 70th birthday. Mr. Yu generously donated the income from his birthday celebration as funds for the construction of the Qiaqing Anti-Tuberculosis Hospital. With the efforts of Mayor Wu and others, funds have now been raised. The Shanghai Medical Affairs Committee has also donated land for the hospital's construction, and the construction is expected to start in the near future.</p>
<p>(10) Organizing branches in various places – If we want to achieve effective tuberculosis prevention, it is essential to establish anti-tuberculosis branches in various places. Due to its limited manpower, the Association cannot send people to organize branches in various places. Therefore, this work does not yet have a proper starting point. However, it continues to strive to contact local gentry to organize branches. Currently, the efforts are focusing on Fuzhou, Changsha, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Beiping, and other places. In the future, once the anti-tuberculosis associations in various places are successfully organized, the reduction in the tuberculosis mortality rate can be anticipated.</p>
<p>The above is a general overview of the work of the Association over the past three years. Due to space limitations, I can only briefly report as above. Other matters, such as the establishment of the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Committee, the expansion of the Association's office, the contact and gathering of members, personnel changes, internal renovation, and the organization of various committees (such as the Medical Affairs Committee, Editorial Committee, and Promotion Committee), cannot be described in detail here. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will understand.</p>
<p>It is not easy to say what the Association's plans are for the next three years. During these three years, various circumstances may limit and make it difficult to make definite decisions. However, we already know that the past three years have been a period of promotional work, that is, a period of educational work. This has allowed society to have a reasonable understanding of tuberculosis prevention and control. This type of promotion is extremely important. However, if work is only promotional without practical action, it cannot arouse social interest or win the trust of the public. It is like opening a store and only advertising without goods. Once citizens go to buy, there is no way to meet their needs. This failure is inevitable. Therefore, the Association's work plan for the next three years should use practical work to prove the necessity and true meaning of the Association's existence.</p>
<p>The implementation method should be based on which aspects have the most achievements and meet the needs of the people, so as to benefit the public.</p>
<p>Establishment of Children's Health Camps</p>
<p>We deeply know that tuberculosis is the most easily transmitted disease. The transmission of pulmonary tuberculosis in the world is faster than any other disease, and more harmful than diseases such as leprosy and cholera. According to recent medical research, pulmonary tuberculosis is extremely easy to transmit from youth to childhood, whether in the milk of humans, cows, and sheep, or in other foods or air. Therefore, children are most susceptible to tuberculosis. According to statistics, from infancy to twelve years old, 80% or 90% have tuberculosis roots. However, sometimes because of stronger physical strength, it does not expand, but if there is a loss of balance or improper protection, it can run rampant. Therefore, attention should be paid to preventing transmission. Therefore, the establishment of children's health camps is more time- and cost-effective, and children benefit more. This is the first plan for the future.</p>
<p>Addition of Clinics</p>
<p>Secondly, clinics should be gradually established. The Association has now set up two clinics. Based on experience, it is more cost-effective to run more. For example, if the cost of running one is 3,000, then running two is only 4,000. If two are planned each year, then six can be added in three years? These clinics must be made universal, that is, methods should be found to establish them in the public concession and the French concession. The main purposes of establishing clinics are: (1) to allow people with mild illnesses to come to the clinic for examination. This work is more effective than hospital treatment, because tuberculosis is extremely difficult to treat in the second and third stages, but it is very easy to treat in the first stage. Prevention is more effective than treatment. Establishing more clinics makes citizens understand the importance of tuberculosis examination and makes it convenient; (2) to allow healthy young people to come to the clinic nearby for physical examinations, so that they know whether they are healthy or have an infection. The development of this outpatient clinic should be promoted as much as possible in three years.</p>
<p>Running Tuberculosis Sanatoriums</p>
<p>Thirdly, running tuberculosis sanatoriums. According to investigations, there are only 350 pulmonary beds in all of Shanghai. If compared with the population and the prevalence of tuberculosis, 3,500 would still not be enough. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish these sanatoriums. Now, a hospital with 50 beds has been established in Jiangwan, but there are already more than 200 registered people. Therefore, even wealthy people who have contracted tuberculosis and want to find a place for recuperation still find it difficult! However, the cost of running sanatoriums is relatively high, and should be implemented based on economic capacity.</p>
<p>Promoting Health Exercises</p>
<p>Fourthly, promoting health exercises. We recall that after the war in Europe, the French army's fatigue resulted in a large increase in tuberculosis patients. Therefore, promoting health exercises to enhance resistance in the next three years of tuberculosis prevention is also a priority.</p>
<p>China now is not the China of ten years ago. The Association's future is to prove whether our organization can exist through work; it is definitely not just relying on promotion. We must offer facts for donations received, and the government and people must unite and work together. At the same time, we should also seek young members to engage in practical work as the most important thing, and economic problems are secondary. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e229">Telegraph Delivery Certificate <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>The telegraph office is a public service organization. Those who work in the telegraph office, whether they are staff or messengers, can be regarded as public servants. The only creed that public servants should adhere to in their duties is loyalty; with loyal public servants and loyal actions, there can be sufficient proof to gain public trust.</p>
<p>It has become a social custom for Chinese people not to send telegrams unless it is important. Therefore, each time a telegram is sent, it is particularly important, and the hope that it will reach its destination quickly is understandable, and the hope that it will be delivered to the recipient is also understandable. There are probably not a few senders who are concerned about their telegram while it is being transmitted. Is the telegraph office, which serves the public, truly loyal? Or do people sometimes harbor doubts?</p>
<p>To resolve this doubt and to let the owner of the telegram know as early as possible that the telegram has indeed reached the hands of the recipient, the only way is to notify the original sender when the original telegram arrives, or to send back the recipient's receipt. This method will be implemented from today, and is called the "Telegraph Delivery Notification."</p>
<p>The delivery notification can also be called a telegraph delivery certificate. This certificate has two major significances: first, does the telegraph office transmit telegrams faithfully and deliver them properly? Looking at this certificate, the truth is clear. Second, how fast is the telegram transmitted? Can it meet the sender's expectations? With this delivery certificate, it can be used for investigation.</p>
<p>In fact, the transmission of telegrams, except in special circumstances (the so-called special circumstances, such as military periods, congested telegraph services, or line obstacles, and long-distance retransmissions), usually takes the shortcut, and is sent as soon as it arrives, with very little delay. However, although this is the case in reality, senders often inevitably have many concerns, because they have no absolute proof of speed. From now on, doubts can be dispelled, and anxiety is unnecessary. Just add the words "Return Receipt" before the text of the telegram, and soon you will be able to receive proof of delivery to relieve your concerns. The telegraph office serves the public, and the adoption of this method is not only for the sender's sake, but also provides faithful proof of the telegraph office's performance of its duties.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Reading "Telecommunications and Transportation and Transportation Construction" <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read Mr. Lin Diffei's "Telecommunications and Transportation and Transportation Construction" in the social service column of the Jiangxi Min Guo Daily on November 6. The article discussed the recent case in which the Guangchang Telegraph Branch presented a complaint, accusing the highway authority of opening business telephone services between Shangfeng, Nancheng, Guangchang, and Ningdu, and the Guangchang County Government telephone exchange of connecting with local agencies to make telephone calls, which harmed the telegraph branch's telephone business revenue. The telegram branch requested that the Telecommunications Administration relay the matter to the provincial government for strict prohibition. Mr. Lin, with an objective attitude, spoke a word for the telecommunications authorities. The attention of people from all walks of life to the telecommunications industry can be described as a good sign for sorting out the future.</p>
<p>The main points of Mr. Lin's article can be summarized as follows: (1) Telephone transportation is not explicitly stipulated as the monopoly of the telecommunications business, and is also not allowed by national politics and human economic behavior. (2) The telegraph office is a national transportation agency and should not be profit-oriented. (3) The Guangchang Telegraph Branch's telephone business charges excessive fees and is not economical in terms of time. (4) The Guangchang Telegraph Branch should not be greedy for credit and make false reports to hinder the development of transportation construction. The points mentioned seem to be reasonable, and it is feared that Mr. Lin is not the only one who holds such views. However, from the standpoint of the state-owned telecommunications business, there is indeed value in discussing it. The author does not know the ins and outs of this case, nor how the Jiangxi telecommunications authorities handled it. I would like to present it to Mr. Lin and people from all walks of life in the spirit of a third party, based on legal principles:</p>
<p>(1) According to the Telecommunications Regulations promulgated by the National Government on August 5, 1929, Article 2 states, "All telecommunications operated by the state shall be managed by the Ministry of Transportation of the Executive Yuan of the National Government; however, the army, navy, and air force agencies shall be responsible for military purposes. The self-built ones are not subject to this rule." The following telecommunications in Article 3 may be established by local governments, public-private organizations, or individuals after approval by the Ministry of Transportation of the Executive Yuan of the National Government or its entrusted agencies: ... (1) Those dedicated to railways, mines, or other special businesses: (2) Those used for Deesignating purposes when ships and aircraft are sailing; (3) Those who connect with local telecommunications agencies to communicate for the convenience of map transmission and reception: (4) Those dedicated to communication within the scope of a house lot: (5) Those dedicated to broadcasting news, lectures, weather, music, and songs that are beneficial to the public: (6) Those used for academic trial tests: (7) Establish telephones in a certain area where there is no telephone connection." Furthermore, according to the revised organizational law of the Ministry of Transportation promulgated by the National Government in February 1931, the regulations on the jurisdiction of administrative matters stipulated by the third Central Executive Committee at its second plenary session in October 1929, and the order of the Executive Yuan No. 385 on January 10, 1929, transferring and approving the order of the National Government on the telephone business to be handled by the Ministry of Transportation, as well as Article 19 of the KMT's internal policy platform, it has long been explicitly stipulated by the highest party and government authorities that the telephone business should be under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation. The so-called "national politics and human economic behavior do not allow" is based on something that seems unfounded.</p>
<p>(2) State-owned telephone businesses should not be profit-oriented, which is the opinion of informed people, and is also the policy that the Ministry of Transportation is currently vigorously pursuing. However, for decades, China's telecommunications industry has been trying to maintain itself entirely on the basis of "using telecommunications to support telecommunications," and has not received any subsidies from the national treasury. If we do not pay attention to business revenue, not only will the expansion plan not be able to be implemented, but even the current situation will not be able to be maintained. Therefore, within the scope of the law, the telegraph office has the right to sue in accordance with the law for anything that damages the telecommunications business. The various points of accusation made by the Guangchang Bureau, from the perspective of the telecommunications industry itself, are actually duties that must be fulfilled; otherwise, there will inevitably be acts of negligence of duty.</p>
<p>(3) The price of long-distance calls is generally calculated according to the call time and distance. The longer the call and the farther the distance, the more expensive the call. The Ministry-run long-distance telephone call price takes three minutes as the length and the spatial distance between the two places as the standard. Its purpose is to reduce the burden on the people. The prices in various places must be opened for business only after being approved by the Ministry of Transportation. This price is extremely low, only one-third of that in the United Kingdom and one-third of that in the United States. The Guangchang to Ningdu line is 70 kilometers long and the spatial distance is 50 kilometers. The charge for each call is three yuan, which is not excessive. The three-minute system is uniformly adopted for long-distance copper coin telephones run by the Ministry, and is an international system. The public who use long-distance telephones in various places in China have not heard of any inconvenience. The callers of long-distance telephones must have urgent matters to discuss, and the speaking must be simple and concise, and idle talk should be removed. In this way, the three-minute call time will naturally be enough. If there are complex matters that need to be discussed carefully, you can continue for three minutes. There is no reason to change the three-minute system to a five-minute system due to the need for a longer time for a small number of calls, thereby increasing the price standard and increasing the burden on the general caller. This is clear. However, if the telegraph office is too slow in handling long-distance telephone procedures, or if there are unsatisfactory points in the business, people from all walks of life can ask for improvements, and the telephone authorities are welcome.</p>
<p>(4) The telegraph office for the telecommunications transportation is the nerve system of a country. According to the law, it should be under the jurisdiction or supervision of the Ministry of Transportation, as mentioned above. However, the construction agencies of various provinces boast about local construction, and set up long-distance telephones in places where there are already Ministry-run long-distance telephones in various provinces. Not only are the parts and wires not in line with technical standards, but there is also no overall plan, resulting in the waste of public funds due to repeated construction or piecemeal construction. The reduction of call prices and competing with the Ministry's affiliated agencies for temporary profits is not allowed by law. In order to jointly develop the telephone business with the provincial governments, the Ministry of Transportation drew up the "Principles for the Ministry of Transportation to Entrust the Provincial Governments to Handle Long-Distance Telephones," which was approved by the Executive Yuan on July 7, 1933. If the Jiangxi construction authorities are really planning to develop the telephone transportation business, they should negotiate with the Jiangxi Telecommunications Administration to determine the method of entrustment, in order to comply with the law. Based on the above, the Guangchang County Government's communication with local agencies does have an effect of harming the revenue of the state-owned telephone business. The highway authority's opening of business telephone services between Nanfeng, Nancheng, Guangchang, and Ningdu is the same, and there is no basis in law. The Guangchang Telegraph Bureau truthfully reported it and asked for a ban, which is reasonable.</p>
<p>In short, telecommunications and transportation are the most needed construction undertakings at present. It is commendable that local agencies can work hard on this. However, to follow the central laws and regulations, communication system, and proceed step by step, both financial resources, manpower, and time will not be wasted, and the effect of a finger can be achieved. Otherwise, conflicts and disputes will be endless. Why should those who advocate construction do this?</p>

<h3 id="e232">Overview of Special Types of Long-Distance Telephone Calls <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Baozhen</p>
<p>The newly revised Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Business Regulations stipulate that long-distance telephone calls are divided into three types: call number communication, call person communication, and paging communication, as well as two categories: ordinary and expedited. To enhance the convenience of telephone calls for the public, three additional types of special calls are separately stipulated as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Special Contract Call: If a caller wishes to make a call between two designated telephone sets at a predetermined time on a specific date for a fixed period, they may enter into a special contract call agreement with the telephone bureau to ensure adherence. The effective period of this special contract call agreement must be at least one month, and the call fee must be paid in advance. After the calling user has entered into a special contract call with the telephone bureau, they can communicate with the other party at a specific time each day, saving the trouble of applying for registration on a case-by-case basis. Special contract calls are particularly convenient for businesses or exchanges that want to communicate with counterpart businesses in other locations at a specific time each day to report market conditions. This is because all types of long-distance telephone calls are prioritized based on registration order. It is difficult to predict when a long-distance telephone call registered through ordinary procedures can connect with the other party. Therefore, if a calling user wants to communicate with relevant businesses in other locations at a specific time each day, it is more convenient to use the special contract call mentioned above.</p>
<p>(2) Scheduled Call: A long-distance telephone call is called a scheduled call if the caller specifies a desired call time within the prescribed business hours when registering. If a caller wishes to use the scheduled call service, they must register with the telephone bureau in advance, a certain number of hours before the scheduled call time. The exact time will be stipulated and announced by the telephone bureau that offers this special service. The advantage of scheduled calls is that since the call time is predetermined, after the caller pays the fee and registers with the telephone bureau, they only need to go to make the call when the scheduled call time is approaching. If there are other important matters to attend to, they can go elsewhere, without wasting time waiting because they want to use a long-distance telephone.</p>
<p>(3) Night Call: A long-distance telephone call made during a specified period at night, where the call rate is lower than the daytime call rate, is called a night call. Previously, the Ministry of Transportation changed the long-distance telephone call calculation to be based on three-minute intervals. Furthermore, due to busy telephone lines during the day, the telephone bureau limited consecutive calls to three times, according to regulations. This was inconvenient for callers who needed to have longer conversations with the other party. For example, a news reporter stationed in Beijing might need a long-distance telephone call to report the news they gathered each day to a Shanghai newspaper office, which often required a lengthy conversation to complete the task. To meet the needs of the public and to unclog telephone traffic, the Ministry promulgated a measure to reduce the price of long-distance telephone calls at night. It stipulates that all calling users who make calls between 8:00 PM and 6:00 AM the next morning will be charged at a specific rate, which is approximately 30% lower than the daytime call rate. For example, if the ordinary daytime call rate from location A to location B is one yuan per call, the ordinary night call rate is only seventy cents. Furthermore, the expedited procedure can also be applied to night calls, with the fee being double the ordinary night call rate. Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Wujin, and Wuxian were designated as the first seven locations for trial implementation, starting from December 1, 1935. After the new regulations are implemented, this measure will continue to be implemented, and efforts will be made to gradually extend it to other locations in the future.</p>
<p>If a caller uses the above-mentioned special contract calls and scheduled calls, and the long-distance telephone line is already occupied when the scheduled call time arrives, the telephone bureau will connect the call after the existing telephone conversation has ended, according to regulations. However, even if the caller has to wait slightly in such situations, it will only be a matter of minutes, and they should not feel too impatient.</p>
<p>The opening locations and detailed implementation measures for the above three special types of calls are to be reported by local telephone bureaus to the Ministry of Transportation for approval and then publicly announced for implementation based on social needs. Therefore, they cannot be universally implemented throughout the country at once. In the future, as long-distance telephone business develops gradually in various locations, if the telephone bureau finds that there is a need to open the above-mentioned calls, it can report to the Ministry of Transportation for approval at any time to facilitate the public.</p>

<p>(1) Please do not shake the handset while talking.</p>
<p>(2) When the other party is speaking, listen quietly and wait for them to finish a section before replying. Please do not interrupt to avoid both parties' voices becoming unintelligible.</p>
<p>(3) Please do not speak too softly or too loudly. The volume should be consistently moderate to ensure that the voice is clearer.</p>

<h3 id="e234">Review of "A True Man" <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Yijun</p>
<p>Written by Fan Wenlan, Published by Kaiming Bookstore, 4 jiao</p>
<p>At a time when the call for "National Defense Literature" is resounding loudly, the publication of this book, "A True Man," can be said to be timely. From its title, we can guess that it must be about stories of national heroes. When we open the table of contents, this guess is confirmed without any discount. The book contains the stories of twenty-five national heroes in history, whose names are: Zhang Qian, Wei Qing, Huo Qubing, Li Guang, Su Wu, Zhao Chongguo, Ma Yuan, Ban Chao, Liu Kun, Xuanzang, Yan Gaoqing, Zhang Xun, Xu Yuan, Di Qing, Zong Ze, Yue Fei, Zhang Shijie, Lu Xiufu, Wen Tianxiang, Fang Xiaoru, Qi Jiguang, Xiong Tingbi, Yuan Chonghuan, Shi Kefa, and Huang Daozhou.</p>
<p>The author's motivation for writing this book is worthy of our praise. In the first item of the "Explanatory Notes," he says: "Mencius said: 'Wealth and rank cannot corrupt him, poverty and meanness cannot move him, might and force cannot subdue him. These are the qualities of a true man.' ... If a person has such firm self-confidence and such noble aspirations, I believe that any great and immortal cause and honor can be easily achieved. Therefore, this book is named 'A True Man,' and I hope that every reader will also learn to be a true man." At present, the trend of the world is frivolous and servile to the extreme, and there are even people who "only know how to serve foreigners, but forget the great righteousness between races." If we can put forward a few historical figures with both virtue and righteousness to serve as a warning to the public, wouldn't it be a very meaningful thing?</p>
<p>The author's criteria for selecting the ancients are also agreeable to me. He says, "...both morality and career are emphasized, with greater emphasis on morality. This is because the success or failure of a career is mostly governed by the environment, while the responsibility of morality can be shouldered by anyone. ...Do what is right, even at the cost of one's life. The more one knows that it cannot be done and yet does it, the more one shows the greatness of one's personality." Of course, there are not only these twenty-five such historical figures. In the five thousand years of history, there have been countless patriots who have sacrificed their lives to protect the lives of the nation. However, the deeds of these people have mostly been erased by later historians, and now we have no way to fabricate them. Therefore, the twenty-five people in this book actually represent the full personality of many national heroes in history.</p>
<p>The eras to which these twenty-five people belonged include the Western Han, Eastern Han, Eastern Jin, Tang, Northern Song, Southern Song, and Ming dynasties, and half of them are loyal officials and men of integrity in the late years of the dynasties, who are truly the true men who "know that it cannot be done and yet do it." Generally, at the end of a dynasty, society must be immersed in decadence, most people are living a life of drunken stupor in which they "get through one day at a time," and the political order must be extremely chaotic. Treacherous ministers gain power, and loyal and upright ministers suffer. At this time, if someone steps forward, speaks out for justice, and supports the precarious situation, the public's vision will be renewed, and the sense of respect and admiration will arise spontaneously. Although nine out of ten of their actions end in failure, "justice resides in the hearts of the people," and everyone with a little conscience will always remember them. Although official documents can erase their great achievements, they still cannot prevent the spread of folk tales, unofficial histories, notes, romances, and ballads from passing on their deeds to immortality. The most prominent example is Yue Fei. In official history, Yue Fei is only a person who advocated war, and his battles were not always beneficial. When we read the History of the Song Dynasty, we often feel that in such a difficult time for the Song Dynasty, Qin Hui's policy of peace was not so absurd, and that he, Han Shizhong, and their subordinates were all arrogant and brave soldiers who did not obey the orders of the central government. Summoning them back for questioning and punishment became a necessary means for the central government to rectify its authority. However, this attempt to cover up the eyes and ears of the world ultimately failed. We still have many unofficial histories and romances, and Yue Fei, who has existed in people's hearts for hundreds of years, is Yue Fei in the romances, a national hero with "righteousness reaching the heavens," and a true man with loyalty, filial piety, and integrity. There are many such cases. If we can restore everyone to their original appearance, it would be a very meaningful task.</p>
<p>The reason why Mr. Fan wrote this book about true men in history is better said to be that he was moved by the affairs of the time and used history to express his feelings and to warn us. After narrating the deeds of each person, he must attach a small commentary, which is the author's true intention. In the commentary after the article "Wei Qing," he says:</p>
<p>"...Originally, when a nation is oppressed and plundered by another nation, it is unquestionable that it must resist and take revenge... To live in peace and steal life, to dry one's face with saliva, and even to try to destroy one's own inherent strength as much as possible and be a vanguard for the enemy, such a slavish nation will certainly not be tolerated between heaven and earth!"</p>
<p>After the section "Zong Ze," he says:</p>
<p>"At the end of the Northern Song Dynasty, there were really many talents who could save the country, and their loyalty and integrity were unprecedented in the Han and Tang Dynasties... Unfortunately, the imperial court never believed that the Chinese people would have the ability to resist the Jin Dynasty, let alone believe that they would ultimately succeed. Therefore, the imperial court never dared to risk trusting people like Zong Ze and Yue Fei, who had made definite achievements, for fear of an irreversible defeat. The key to Emperor Suzong of Tang's ability to restore the old order was not running to Sichuan. Prince Kang lacked this spirit and only wanted to compromise and survive, but in fact, if it were not for Zong Ze and Yue Fei's desperate resistance, the partial peace would probably not have been established!... Therefore, we know that a country or a person who loses self-confidence in a crisis is truly terminally ill."</p>
<p>After the section "Zhang Shijie, Lu Xiufu," he says:</p>
<p>"This dynasty, which has been established for three hundred years, has always adopted the most peaceful and humble attitude towards foreign countries. According to reason, foreign countries should be at peace and should no longer advance an inch. Unfortunately, the Liao, Jin, and Yuan Dynasties did not understand those principles of courtesy and righteousness and only plundered forward. They really let down the Song Dynasty's good intentions! Emperor Taizong of Song failed in his Northern Expedition, and the Northern Song Dynasty never dared to dream of the Sixteen Prefectures of Youyun again. Emperor Gaozong of Song fled to Jiangnan, and the Southern Song Dynasty, the emperor and his ministers were content to survive in a small court and dared not look at the Central Plains again. When Lin'an fell and Deyou was captured, wouldn't it be unreasonable for the two or three loyal ministers to want to survive in the desolate and miasmic land and continue the last breath of the Zhao family? Finally, they drifted to the sea and dared not live on land again. Wouldn't this be even more unreasonable? However, the enemy does not care whether you are reasonable or not, and in short, they must be completely wiped out. Therefore, after reading the history of the Song Dynasty's demise, we know that if a country does not work hard and retreats from foreign countries, even a fool will understand its fate."</p>
<p>These words are so poignant and powerfully whipping at the hearts of each of us now! We will naturally understand the author's heart. I believe that everyone who reads these passages will think of the current affairs because of the lessons of history, and think that our current situation is precisely entering the last few years of the Song Dynasty!</p>
<p>Although this book only retells some historical events, we already feel that the author's intention is worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the author cannot write it in a literary style. If it could be written in the form of a historical novel, its effect would be ten or a hundred times greater than it is now. The author is very拘泥to the source of history. He says, "There is no word without origin, and no word without basis... Absolutely avoid the novelist's fabricated falsehoods and the ills of confusing facts." He thinks this is the advantage of the book, but we can only think it is the shortcoming of the book. We may not discuss whether historical novels (that is, the romances that the author said) are the same as the author's understanding, even if they are fabricated falsehoods (in fact, it is definitely not so), it is not inconsistent with the author's motivation for writing this book. Doesn't the author's "great righteousness" also have to use historical facts to warn our current people? What we ask of the readers is not only "to know a little history without digesting it, but more importantly, to obtain serious lessons from it." In this way, listing facts is obviously worse than describing facts. We hope that someone else will take on this task. Mr. Fan has already collected the most detailed raw materials for us here.</p>

<p>Recently, Kaiming Bookstore has published several history and geography books aimed at this great era, which are very much needed by young people, such as: "A True Man," "The Story of National Crisis," "Shu Road," etc. Readers are very excited about these books. We can tell from the many reviews and reflections we have received on these books. This journal published Mr. He Si's "Where Should We Go?" in the last issue. This issue published Mr. Yijun's "Review of A True Man" and Mr. Jia Ming's "Postscript to Reading Shu Road," which are very useful for those who plan to read these books.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Postscript to Reading "Shu Road" <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Ming</p>
<p>Since the unification of Sichuan Province and the restoration of security, due to the increasingly serious national crisis, people across the country have gained a new understanding and developed a new hope for the future of Sichuan Province. Therefore, the province has gradually become a target of national attention.</p>
<p>In the past year or two, there has been a considerable flurry of documents about the exploration of Sichuan, from complete masterpieces to scattered essays, scattered in newspapers, magazines, and printed publications. However, from a certain standpoint, I have a special sympathy for this book and consider it to be a fairly accurate account.</p>
<p>In general, Sichuan is nothing more than a place with abundant products and beautiful scenery. The concept of "Land of Abundance" will not be blurred in the consciousness of any Chinese person. The beauty of the Three Gorges and the Jialing River is always the content of poets' imaginations! However, in this book, there is a further, realistic discovery, which makes any Chinese person, after receiving it, unable to help but feel surprised and awakened in addition to envy and fantasy.</p>
<p>According to the author's observations, Sichuan is indeed "rich" and "beautiful," but if we further investigate the lives of the people, there is another strange word—"miserable." In this small jade country, the rich are rich and the poor are poor. There are abundant materials, but people don't know how to use them. There is beautiful scenery, but it is only for a part of the privileged class to fully enjoy. Even under the greatest possible invasion and exploitation, the powerless are unable to live, and as a result, huge numbers are manifested in the mortality rate, to the point where women have no clothes and pants to cover their shame, and the starving corpses fill the roads and people eat each other.</p>
<p>Based on the author's hearsay and eyewitness accounts, we can appreciate the following abandoned writings of the "miserable" world with an emotion of "believing that there is no such thing":</p>
<p>"Chen, a resident of Banbian Street in Songpan, committed suicide by eating his eight-year-old biological daughter, and soon the woman also died of illness and starvation. Within hundreds of miles along the way, human blood and bones and those who died of starvation filled the ditches, which was unbearable to witness."</p>
<p>"On March 1, it was heard that four of the seven members of a family in Caojiagou had already starved to death, and the remaining three were also dying... Many famine refugees from afar passed through the area and were all killed... They were divided, roasted, and eaten without residue..."</p>
<p>In history, there have often been tragic situations of "exchanging children for food and cooking skeletons for cooking" in the country and city. In this generation, they can actually eat their own children "without exchanging," which makes the former pale in comparison! Another example is a road worker who complained to the author, "...We are all poor people, working one day and eating one day. During the busy farming season, we are not allowed to farm, but we are forced to work. We are not given money or food. Where do we have surplus grain? We borrowed a few liters of rice from our neighbors, carried it, and walked sixty miles, and then we walked here. Now the rice is gone, and the work is not finished. We are going to starve to death here..." This is probably an even rarer "miracle"! We know that the distribution of workers' rations and the distance between the residence of those who are requisitioned and the work site are all regulated by central laws, right? Why is there such a factual discovery? I think that in addition to the author's shrewdness and courage, it is probably not something that ordinary articles and books can discover.</p>
<p>In this province, there is also a special phenomenon of oppression, which is the so-called field tax problem that many people have reported on. This book also contains profound and detailed records, as follows:</p>
<p>"Taking one hundred mu as a unit... In the early years of the Republic of China, the tax was changed to sixteen yuan. During the defense zone era, the tax was increased to thirty yuan. This is for one year, also known as one tax. If one year is taxed for six years, then 180 yuan is required; if it is taxed for ten years, then 300 yuan is required; if one month is taxed for one year, then 360 yuan is required... Those with special power have more land and less grain; otherwise, they have less land and more grain. There are those who pay grain every year but do not know where the land is, which is called flying grain... So how much grain should be paid for how much land is a question that even the landlords cannot answer... In areas such as Baxian, it is calculated in "dan"; in areas such as Yongchuan, it is calculated in "tiao"..."</p>
<p>"In 1923, Chengdu County had already collected taxes until 1979... It is said that the most is Guangyuan County, which collected taxes until 2001..."</p>
<p>"At present, the burden on the people of Sichuan Province, in terms of field tax, although the provincial government has done its best to rectify it... still requires the collection of grain for seven or eight years, or even more than ten years in one year..."</p>
<p>Under this heavy burden, what is the way out for the people? Those who are strong and sturdy will have to take risks,揭扜and rise up, and there will be so-called "sectarian bandits" and "local bandits." The weak and incompetent can only fall into the situation of "death" and "digging corpses." As the author said, "Those who can be tempted by bandits today may not be able to be used by the enemy tomorrow... The worries of the overall national situation are tied to this, and it should not be taken lightly."</p>
<p>In addition to these exposures of the real world, the author uses his clear and simple literary language to describe many beautiful scenes. However, the author always stands on the position of education and social service, and all descriptions are taken in a common-sense and reporting manner. Therefore, this book is completely different from ordinary pure literary travel notes, and it is suitable for people who need rich common sense and experiences.</p>
<p>In addition, the author claims that there are many purposes for going to Sichuan, among which there is also the so-called: "I want to see what the thoughts and abilities of the general young people in Sichuan are like? How will they cultivate themselves to shoulder future responsibilities?" Based on this, lectures to young male and female students are agreed to as long as time permits. A total of thirty-four lectures have been given, covering areas such as saving the country, starting a career, and marriage. It is said that several times, many young people were moved to tears. At the same time, the author often made appointments with many young people to talk alone. There were not enough seats in the residence, so they often talked on the ground. Therefore, this book can be read not only as a travelogue but also as a book on youth cultivation.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into five sections. The first section is the concept of traveling to Sichuan. The second section is a hundred-day diary of traveling to Sichuan, which is the main part of the book. The descriptions of social life and natural scenery are all included in this book. The third section is a letter to young students in Sichuan, which I believe can provide considerable help for the cultivation of young people in general and is by no means something that "only young people in Sichuan are worth reading." For example, what is said: "The national crisis is forcing us to this point, can we still study to death?... Everyone, open your eyes wide!" Aren't these very broad and timely? The fourth section is a brief overview of the transformation of new Sichuan. It is said that the author named the book "Shu Road" for two reasons: ㈠ The "Shu Road" of "Shu Road is difficult." ㈡ The way to govern Shu, this section is aimed at the latter. The fifth section is a hundred quatrains of traveling to Shu. This new and refreshing poetic style is also worth reading for friends who generally love old poems.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Reading "Bacteria and Humans" <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Lin</p>
<p>Written by Gao Shiqi, Published by Kaiming Bookstore, 4 jiao 5 fen</p>
<p>"Regarding bacteriology, I... will gradually use simple and interesting words to disguise this mysterious and subtle science, no, to strip it naked, so that it becomes not a strange commodity for experts, but a snack and supplement for the general public..." It is said on page 121 of the original book that the author of "Bacteria and Humans" describes a passage in which he writes scientific essays. After reading this collection, I do feel that the author has achieved this point.</p>
<p>Science is the most practical and most needed kind of knowledge in life. If mankind wants to conquer nature, they must consult Mr. Science.</p>
<p>Ordinary science readings are like moralistic gentlemen, making people respect and fear them. The average person does not dare to ask him for advice.</p>
<p>If someone were to dress up scientific articles in literary attire and meet the public, I think the public would be very happy to approach him and ask him for advice.</p>
<p>The collection of scientific essays, "Bacteria and Humans," is a practical example before us. (I heard that many people welcome the author's articles.)</p>
<p>This booklet is a collection of twenty-nine scientific essays, most of which are about bacteriology. Bacteriology is originally a specialized field of study. Books on bacteria written by specialists are probably dry and tasteless professional books, which are not welcomed by the general public. However, the author used light-hearted essays to write the common sense of this science, which makes people read with relish and does not feel boring. This is very gratifying.</p>
<p>The author can be said to be very successful in writing scientific essays. His success is due to his rare talent.</p>
<p>First, he can write dry and tasteless scientific knowledge in a very interesting way. Some places simply have a lot of humor, which makes readers smile at the corners of their mouths when they see it.</p>
<p>Second, the author can cleverly mix and describe scientific knowledge with human affairs, and can naturally connect the two sides without feeling stiff. He often takes the opportunity to express his views and satirize the ugliness of the world. Originally cold and rational scientific articles have been transformed into very lively essays with emotions under the author's pen. This cannot but be said to be the author's success.</p>
<p>Third, the author sometimes uses a historical writing style to write about the historical facts of scientists fighting bacteria, inspiring readers on how mankind should strive to fight against nature in order to obtain their own happiness. This is also a good writing style.</p>
<p>Fourth, the author's writing is very fluent, which is of course also one of the elements of success.</p>
<p>The author is successful in writing skills. Sometimes, perhaps because the author pays too much attention to the effort in skills, a few articles are inevitably a little insufficient in content. For example, in the article about color blindness, I feel that the reason for color blindness is not written adequately. I think that when writing scientific essays, you should not only write about superficial phenomena, but also explain its essence. The author not only wants readers to know a certain state of affairs. Of course, he should also let him understand its "reason for being." I believe that the author of "Bacteria and Humans" can, with his talent, write out the mysterious and wonderful scientific truth "in simple and interesting words."</p>
<p>Perhaps inadvertently, the author sometimes reveals some traditional consciousness in his writing. For example, what "Heaven... has the virtue of loving life." Such words should not be found in the works of a scientist. We know that the changes in nature are carried out according to the laws of nature, and are definitely not governed by any "Heaven." I hope the author will be more careful when writing in the future.</p>
<p>Some people say that although some of the articles in this collection are very beautiful, the literary content they contain seems to be too strong and not understandable by the general public. This is an undeniable fact. However, regarding this point, the author has already corrected it in his recently published articles.</p>
<p>In summary, on the whole, "Bacteria and Humans" is a very excellent collection of scientific essays, and it is a good book worth reading.</p>
