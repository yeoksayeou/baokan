<h3>兒童年的新收獲</h3>
<p>— 鄭曉滄</p>
<p>開明書店的新少年出版了，我的略看過一遍，覺得內容很充實，我很願意鄭重地把它介紹給敎育界同人和賢明的父母。</p>
<p>優良的讀物是少年男女們的「心靈的糧食」，它在敎育上的作用如何重大，我不想多說，這是大家老早知道了的。目前我國的出版界中適於少年男女們閱讀的東西如何貧乏，我也不想多說，這是事實，大家早已感覺到的。我在這裏要指說的是新少年所具有的幾個特點：</p>
<p>第一點，新少年的主旨是「使少年們欣賞文藝，了解自然，認識社會，」差不多包括了知識的全部，不論於某一方面。就創刊號看來，內容叉都新穎活潑，這大可以補助中小學敎課的不足。</p>
<p>第二點，我國人過去對於兒童刊物或少年刋物，都存輕視的態度，以爲這不過是幼稚的兒童刊物或少年刋物罷了。因此成功的作家往往不屑在這種刊物上投稿，這不能不說是一種錯誤的觀念。新少年的編者和撰稿者如茅盾，聖陶，子愷，仲華，均正……諸先生都是知名的作家，這樣集中人村用全力來從事，好像以前還不曾有過。</p>
<p>第三點，一般兒童讀物或少年讀物的內容，因爲力求「淺近」的緣故，往往流於「淺薄」。新少年創刊號裏所收的文章旣不過於艱深，也不失於「淺薄」。不過在文字方面整個的基調似乎微嫌濃重一點。</p>
<p>民國二十四年度是敎育部所規定的「兒童年」，所謂兒童年，除了去年九月初全國各大城市裏舉行幾决熱烈的開幕典禮以外，到現在，似乎聲響也沒有了，這原來不能怪誰不努力，一國中任何大規模事業的進行，都與整個政洽，經濟局面有關，不是靠一部分人憑空幹得起來的。但在任何方面不論大小，能够做得一點，對於整個社會總不無意義。出版界與敎育界原有着不可分離的關係，出版界有良好的刊物，就給敎育界以很大的助力，在這種意義上，開明書店新少年的刋行，實在可說是兒童年的一種寶貴的收穫。</p>
<h3>寫作點什麼</h3>
<h3>葉紹鈞</h3>
<p>——『未厭居習作』自序——</p>
<p>我的散文曾經在十年前和俞平伯先生的散文合在一起，取名劍鞘，由樸社出版。以後寫的，經過一番選剔，取名脚步集，由新中國書局出版。集子出版之後，自己看看，總覺得像個樣子的文篇不多，淘汰還不見得乾淨，引起深切的慚媿。最近兩三年來，又寫了一些散文，朋友勸說，不妨再來一本。我就把這些新作也選剔一番，再把劍鞘和脚步集裹比較可觀的幾篇加進去，又補入當時搜尋不到的幾篇，成爲這一本集子。</p>
<p>我常常想，有志繪畫的人無論愛好甚麼派頭，或者預備開創甚麼派頭，他總得從木炭習作入手。有志文藝的人也一樣，自由自在寫他的經騐和意想就是他的木炭習作，無奈我們從前的國文敎師不很留心這一層，所出題目往往敎我們向自己的經騐和意想以外去尋話說，這使我們在技術修練上吃了不小的虧。吃了虧只有想法補救，有甚麼經騐就寫，有甚麼意想就寫，一方面可以給人家看看，一方面就好比學畫的描畫一個石膏人頭。即使沒有大的野心，不預備寫甚麼傳世的大作，這樣修練也是有益的。能把自己的經騐和意想暢暢快快地寫出來，在日常生活上就有不少的便利，我是存着種想頭寫道些散文的，所以給這一本集子取了個「習作」的名字。</p>
<h3>談自然科學小品</h3>
<p>— 叔明</p>
<p>自從陳望道先生提出了「科學小品」這個名詞以後，就有許多人給牠下定義，定目標，分門類，把冷冷落落的「自由談」鬧得一天星斗。到後來雖然沒有什麼結果，但至少「科學小品」這四個字已深深地印入大衆的腦際了。這努力，我想决不是白費的。</p>
<p>不過對於這一决的論戰，我常常覺得抽象的理論太多，實際的觀察太少。有人把科學小品分做自然科學小品和社會科學小品，那原也沒有什麼大不了的事，可是有些人却在斤斤於討論自然學小品重要呢，還是社會科學小品重要，這在我是覺得可以不必的，因為誰喜歡什麼，一定覺得什麼最重要；譬如眼睛最重要，聾子就不大以為然，說耳朶最重要，瞎子也就不願苟同。其實沒有社會科學，不用說蘇聯至今還是帝俄，但是沒有自然科學，五年計劃恐怕也會變成五十年計劃吧。我以爲有人寫社會科學小品，就讓他寫下去，有人寫自然科學小品，也讓他寫下去，只要有人寫，總是好的，我們旣然不想把不重要的扔到毛厠裏去，我們又何苦爭誰重要呢？</p>
<p>有些人主張自然科學小品必須通過「社會感」。這意思我非常欽佩，可是這，我總覺得有點「懸空討價」。自然科學小品的題材總說不了自然現象；自然現象千差萬別，有些固然和日常生活有密切的關連，有些雖然關連，却並不密切，有些簡直和生活毫無直接關係。一定耍通過「社會感」才算是自然科學小品，那就給了自然科學小品一條無形的鏈子，其結果不是畸形的發展，就是夭折。關於生物現象的題村還可以加以人格化，或就其經濟的關係，而使與人類生活相接觸，至於天文現象和理化現象的題材，那就更加困難了。因爲天文理化現象原是死的東西，有好許多題村，不容易使牠和人類生活相接觸，吾則就要多歧義，出毛病，替斯密司改訂化學敎本的肯特爾（Kenda）在他的At　Home　Among　the　Atoms裏曾經指出。。當奧國靑年物理學家徐丁格唱原子波動說以後，美國的某大日報上有一段介紹文字，說：</p>
<p>「你下次去買原子的時候，必須申明要徐丁格牌號。別讓店家把幾年前波爾的陳貨色混朦你。以後你總得留心看看那東西是吾已經過時」。</p>
<p>肯氏以爲這種叙述雖然通俗易解，爲害却也不小。讀報的人一定會轉念到我們的科學定律和學說只是一種瞎猜想，是隨時可以過時的。結果還誰願意去理解科學呢。</p>
<p>其實怎樣寫科學小品的問題，僅是抽象理論是不够的，要理論能够實踐，那就得從作品中去作實際的考察。</p>
<p>最近聽說開明書店替一九三四年以來努力於寫作自然科學小品的克士賈祖璋顧均正三位先生的作品，分別刊行了三個集子，題名花鳥虫魚，生物素掛，科學趣味。因了這三位作者和我都有一面之雅，所以我聽到這個消息，「揩油」之心油然而生。結果不但把三本書拿到了手頭，而且還有「先覩之快」。我化了一個晚上，讀完了六十四篇作品。讀完以後的第一個感想是：這三本書在大衆敎育的立塲上說，實者比雜誌上發表的更有意義，因爲在那里一共有八十八幅揷圖——誰都知道揷圖是比文字更活潑，更明快地表達大衆知識的一種工具。</p>
<p>對於這三個集子，我覺得各有各的風格，各有各的技巧。我不能舉出那里一篇最可愛，我只覺得看起來每一篇都「爽口」，但都不背於科學的正確性。從各書中內容和形式的分析而歸納出一個怎樣寫科學小品的理論，這工作我想做，但是比較要費一點功夫，這里只能向讀者道一個歉，並且希望有別人來共同担負起這工作。</p>
<h3>新少年徵文</h3>
<p>本刊自創刊號出版後，備受各方掖獎，印數已達十萬以上，結果尚難分配，實爲始料所不及。同人等受此殊寵，惟有加倍努力，以期不負十萬讀者之望。惟是同人等能力有限，見聞容有未周，以後本刊將如何改進，端賴讀者之督策與鼓勵。現擬借「讀書俱樂部」地位，特闢專號，請讀者就下列兩題，各抒偉見，俾作編輯之南針，實深企盼。文字以千字左右爲限，截止期二月十日。（一）讀「新少年」創刋號，（二）我所希望於「新少年」者。　新少年社謹啟</p>
<h3>「平屋雜文」自序</h3>
<p>— 夏丐尊</p>
<p>把所寫的文字收集了一部分付印成書，叫做平屋雜文。</p>
<p>自從祖宅出賣以後，我就沒有自己的屋住。白馬湖幾間小平屋的迭成，在我要算是一生值得紀念的大事。集中所收的文字，大多數並不是在平屋裹寫的，卻差不多都是平屋造成以後的東西，最早的在民國十年，正是平屋造成的那一年。就文字的性質看，有評論，有小說，有隨筆，每種分量旣少，而且都不三不四得可以，評論不像評論，小說不像小說，隨筆不像隨筆，近來有人新造一個雜文的名辭，把不三不四的東西叫做雜文，我覺得我的文字正配叫雜文，所以就定了這個書名。</p>
<p>我對於文學，的確如趙景深先生在立報言林上所說「不大努力」。我自認不配做文人，寫的東西旣不多，而且並不自己記憶保存。這回的結集起來付印，全出於幾個朋友的慫患，朋友之中慫忠最力的要算鄭振鐸先生，他在這一年來，幾乎每决見到就談起出集子的事。</p>
<p>長女吉子，是平日關心我的文字的，她曾豫備替我做收集的工作，不幸今年夏天竟病亡，不及從她父親的文集裹再讀她父親的文字了！</p>
<h3>「歷史小品」</h3>
<p>— 雲彬</p>
<p>近來常常有人把歷史上的舊題材寫成一種新形式的小品文，郭沫若氏在質文（第四期）上發表的那篇「秦始皇將死」，可以說是這一類小品文中的傑作了。郭氏的文學天才是一般人所欽佩的；他從亡命日本以來致力於社會科學的研究，爲着要了解中国古代社會伯情况，更從事於甲骨文金文的研究，道幾方面都有驚人的成績。他的感情是奔放的，文筆是流利的，頭腦是縝密的，因此，他所寫出來的歷史小品不同凡響。在那篇「秦始皇將死」裏，他吿訴我們，歷史上說秦皇爲人蜂準，長目，驚烏膺，豺聲，驚鳥膺今稱雞胸，是軟骨症的特徵，可知秦始皇從小就患軟骨症，所以身體不健康，其結果透出兩種反常的行爲：一種是仇視別人的健康，養成了嗜殺的暴虐性；一種是迷信神仙，甘心受方士們的欺騙。他又告訴我們，秦始皇的本生父呂不章做了十幾年的相邦，相邦這官名很陌生，他加着注釋道：「相邦即相國，因漢人避劉邦的諱，才改邦爲國。」他又吿訴我們，秦始皇名政，秦人連「正」字都要避諱，所以正月改稱「端月」，但趙高和李斯串通了僞造秦始皇的詔書中，卻用了「匡正」這個動詞，故意來犯諱，表示是秦始皇自己的口氣，使扶蘇和蒙恬不得懷疑。凡此種種，都可以表見郭氏的讀書有得。當然，他寫這篇小品的動機不是爲表示他的博學，而是在譏諷那想用暴力來統一思想的專制魔王，到臨終時才恍然大悟，知道自己是「有史以來的第一條大黃瓜」。他描寫秦始皇睡在溫凉車裏，懺悔過去，埋怨自己：「媽的，天下的書你那裏燒得完，天下的思想家你那裏活埋得完呢？就燒完了，活埋完了，你又有什麼？」金聖嘆如果活着，一定在下面批道：「眞有此情！眞有此理！普天下專制魔王，獨裁首領聽者！」</p>
<p>寫歷史小品，决不是僅把某一樁歷史故事重寫一遍就成，必得滲入一點新的意義。像茅盾氏的「大澤鄉」，也是一篇成功的作品。最近我受「新少年」編者的囑付，每期寫一篇歷史小品。我沒有郭沫若，茅盾那樣的天才和素養，自己知道東施效顰，徒增其醜而已。在第一期裏勉强寫了一篇「擊筑悲歌」，自己看看也不滿意，因爲只是把歷史故事重寫一遍，並沒有什麼新的意義。但我又想到了許多題材，預備繼續寫作。例如孟嘗君派他的門客馮驩到薛國去討債的一段故事，可以反映戰國時代封主對於農民的高利貸的剝削。又如堯舜禪讓，也許是氏族社會軍務總司令官的選舉，我們不妨用假想來描寫當時的情形（自然也有一點根據，並非完全出於想像），使讀者知道所謂「禪讓」原來不過如此。這種題材也許對於「新少年」讀者有點好處，——至少比讀普通歷史故事「孔融讓梨」「岳飛刺字」之類有意義得多，我想。</p>
<p>讀了郭沫若氏那篇歷史小品，再看看自己的寫作，覺得無限慚愧，就拉雜寫成這篇短文；並不是自己想寫歷史小品，有意拉兩位名作家來作陪襯。</p>
<h3>書的選擇和删節</h3>
<p>— 企重</p>
<p>吃菜要揀精華吃，廚子端來的一桌，未必每碗都佳；而一碗佳肴之中，也難免有多少不合口胃的東西。假使吃的時候不加選擇，隨便送進口去，待到吃出病來時，去找醫生，未免太不上算。讀咨如吃菜，也得擇精華的讀。</p>
<p>出版界所出的書籍，浩如煙海，我們閱讀的時間和精力有限，要把此浩如煙海的書籍一一過目，事實上有所不能。然而，我們在可能範圍裹，設法多讀幾本書，究竟是較爲有益的事；所以讀書不得不選取精華，這話更有了相當的意義。</p>
<p>書籍中有着不少屬於糟粕而不值一顧的；即一本名著，要冀其全是精英而沒有絲毫糟粕，也是不大容易見到的。我們旣想多讀幾本書，自然，最好有人來替我們選出幾部良好的著作，同時把這些良好著作中的糟粕也爲之淸去。這雖說是過分的奢望，然而也是讀書界一個誠意的要求，於是節本的書籍，也就很需要。</p>
<p>做節本書籍的工作，須得名家來担任才好。這並非是我的偶像崇拜，爲的是刪節者得對該書研究有素，才能刪去糟粕而留下精英；要不然，說不定刪去了精英而留下了糟粕。許多人不愛看刪節書，也許爲此。所以我以爲出版界耍做節本害籍的工作，這一點是應該要注意的。</p>
<p>從事節本工作的，須站在整理的立塲上，將一書的不大合式的地方刪去，同時還不礙於前後連絡，使閱讀者節省時間和精力，而對於某一書的學識和興趣並不减少。當然，這種工作使用於中國的古書是十分適當的，也許就是「整理國故」工作之一種。</p>
<p>現在學生的功課十分繁重，終日伏案孜孜，還不易把功課弄淸，想要閱讀一二本課外的書，更不用說了。因此陳衡哲女士喊着「救救中學生」，大家也就響應起來。我以爲做節本書的工作，也是「救救中學生」的一個方法。</p>
<p>近來開明書店有「節本小說」之刊行，把幾種有名的舊小說，請專家叙訂，刪去糟粕，留着精英，我們自然相信，可以做到這個「節」字的條件的。</p>
<p>現在出版界翻印古書之風甚熾，我以爲與其盲目的翻印，倒不如先將古書整理一下，刪其糟粕，存其精英，然後翻印。道樣的翻印古書，才是有益學術界的工作！不過要注意者，刪訂的人應該對於該書有過澈透研究的學者才行。同時希望開明書店，繼續努力於斯，除了已出的「紅樓夢」「水滸」「三國演義」外，在不久的將來，就有其他潔本的書籍刊行。來稿刋出後，酌酬現金或開明書店書券。來稿槪不退還，亦不先覆。</p>

<h3>日本推出海軍會議之影響</h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>幾經休會延會以及個別折衝之倫敦海軍會議因英美法意四國結成聯合陣綫而以「互相交換造艦程序惰報」之主張與日本之「確立共同最高額制度實行海軍量的限制」建議案相對抗陷於無可調和之絕境日本代表團前日卒將其退出會議之意通知英美法意四國代表團於是此舉世矚目之海軍會議撞其凄淸之喪鐘矣回憶海軍會議在英外部洛迦納室開幕之日各國政治家對於軍縮何等與致勃勃乃談判月餘結果如斯誠使吾人不禁啞然失笑也</p>
<p>倫敦海軍會議之必然一事無成以及日本之必然以其最後手段宣告退出海會早爲客觀的國際政治情勢所决定故日本退出海會之舉殊不足怪惟海軍會議之破裂將引起若何變化其影響於歐洲及遠東形勢者又將若何實値得考慮之重大問題也</p>
<p>吾人以爲日本退出海會以後其直接發生之影響約有四點第一海軍妥恊之絕望必然引起更劇烈的海軍競爭美海軍部長史璜生已於本月八日公開聲明「造艦計劃之實行將靜待會議之結果而後定一　國海軍部亦時時以太平洋海軍防備之現狀爲可慮法意之添造軍艦計劃自去年五月英德海軍協定成立以來卽已着着進行自此以後各國必然加速進行以免落後現倫敦方面已盛傳英美法意四國將訂立載有階梯式條欵之協定以與四簽的國以外諸國作同樣比例之增加海軍競賽競賽之結果如何固無待贅述者第二妥協旣已絕望一切與海軍軍備有關之限制設防恊定自必連帶失效影饗所及太平洋各島嶼中之設防問題將成爲英美日三國海軍對立之中心第三日本代表團之堅持最高共同額制度堅持量的限制之主張就政治問題言之卽堅持東亞之獨佔而不容列强有置啄之餘地此一原則實爲各國代表所不能容忍者但衡諸客觀之惰勢列强因利害不同目標各異在遠東實難有一致之對日陣錢故會議瀕於破裂之際在遠東有廣大利益之英國對日態度頓形軟化擬以對華英日協定以爲轉移海會局勢之交換條件竟出諸外相艾登之口此實充分暴露帝國主義之廬山眞面第四倘英國果與日本單獨進行對華恊定其結果所至必使美國亦連帶退出海會於是英美合作旣成泡影而海軍會議之作用不過限於局部性的歐洲問題縱令德俄代表參加或再邀希臘西班牙瑞典挪威等國加入其所討論之範圍亦僅限於調整英德海軍恊定成立後所造成之新局勢而已何况德俄兩國勢成冰炭能吾一致參加尚屬疑問乎</p>
<p>總之日本退出海會以後英美法意四國會議雖仍有繼續進行之消息但亦不過就各國造艦計劃交換意見以便收塲而已對於海軍會議之前途固未能有絲毫之補救也</p>

<p>英報論遠東局勢</p>
<p>倫敦　新聞紀事報頃對日本最近在中國北部之行動有所詳論、其言曰、「日本關東軍對於所推行之對華征略政策、不欲受東京方面之節制、可見中國政府最近對於日本所提要求、雖已極端讓步、但殊未奏效也、抑中國政府採取此項態度之目的、或在延宕時間、俾俟國聯會處理意阿爭端振其威權之後、中國得以重向國聯會申請保護、庶幾較有成功之把握、此在日本則乘國聯會目前無暇顧及遠東問題之際、盡量掠奪中國本部土地、俾國聯會一旦决定對日實施制裁及此項制裁手段付諸實施之時、日本得以無所恐懼」云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日本退出海會　促進英美合作　彼此諒解造艦競爭可免　英將重考慮太平洋地位　五強代表昨最後集議</h3>
<p>倫敦　今日海軍會議開會後、日本必退會、此殆為確定無疑之事、美總代表台維斯入會塲時、表示意見、謂此將為五強會議之最後集議云、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據每日電聞海軍訪員之意見、日本退出海軍會議後、太平洋或將有新發展、如美政府决議實行創設新海軍根據地之計畫、則英國將被迫重行考慮其在太平洋之地位、例如香港之防務、已十六年未予涉及、今已不合時宜、該訪員又謂日本之行動、不致引起造艦競爭、因英美已商妥關於彼此軍力之諒解、兩國因此可免競爭造艦之可能性也、日本之強硬姿勢、已使美國不得不完成其龐大之海軍造艦程序、至一九四二年美國海軍可握世界之牛耳矣云、</p>
<p>衆料今日午後海會在第三次延會後開會考慮日本平等要求時、日本將實行宣吿退出該會、蓋各方面以為日本之建議付表决時、必遭拒絕、於是將終止日本之參加也、同時聞英美代表團昨日會商兩小時後、已駁絕日本所稱海會在日本退出後仍能合法進行之說、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>總委員會開會程序</p>
<p>倫敦　晨郵報對於海軍會議總委員會本月開會程序、記載甚詳、據稱「總委員會開會後、將先由日本代表團發表聲明書、然後其他各國、依照國名首一字母之次序、先後發言、惟日本聲明書、必甚冗長、而本日會議時間有限、依照原定程序、日本代表宣讀聲明書之後、係由美國代表最先發言、美國惟恐總委員會於該國代表表示意見之後、卽行宣吿延會、外間印象或將認為反對日本要求者、僅有美國一國、亟欲有以避免之、故將向總委員會提議、一俟日本代表畢詞之後、卽行延會至星期四日、俾美法英意四國、得以循序一一申述意見、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>日退會通吿殊簡略</p>
<p>東京　今日由海軍外務兩省恊議結果、製成退出軍縮會議通吿文、確聞其內容至為簡潔、大致如左、</p>
<p>「日本帝國政府所提之量的共同最大限度設定案、現旣未獲各國贊成、則今後不得出席會議而參加討論、但開會以來參加之各國、均以友好精神審議日本提案、吾人對此衷心表示感謝」云云、（十五日同盟社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　頃悉日本退出海軍會議之通吿、將於星期四日（十六日）由該國首席代表永野大將、以書面送達海軍會議主席英國外相艾登、除非該國代表團、按獲東京新訓令、則此項態度不致變更、至通吿之措詞大約將於事前送交艾登、請其贊同、日本退出會議之後、是否將指派觀察員、留駐此間、現尚未悉、茍有指派之必要、則將以日本駐英大使館軍事參贊一人為觀察員云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>倫敦　英美會談之結果、十七日續開第一委會、此爲日本代表出席之最後會議、預料各國代表對四提案一齊加以批評、主席孟賽爾海相將於某一委員會散後、要求日本派傍聽員列席四國會議、衆料四國會議自二十日起開、（十四日同盟社電）</p>
<h3>英態度轉強硬　海會不因日退出而結束</h3>
<p>東京　外務省十四日晚由日代表團接到十三日日英會談內容之報吿、已知會議决裂勢不可避免、因此退出會議之行動、完全委任全權實行、據報吿書內容、永野全權十二日奉政府訓令凖備設明日本軍縮棄後提議會議之完結、乃於十三日日英會談席上發言、謂各國不能承認日本軍縮案、則應認五國會議决裂、卽時着手善後辦法、關於禁止商船武裝限制使用潛水艦等有解决可能性之問題、締結條約以完會議、英國代表對此答謂、日本旣然希望會議之圓滿進行、會議須要聽取日本詳說其軍縮方針、同時審議量的限制問題一部份之造艦通吿案、日本如不同意、則可取自由行動、但英美法意四國續開四國會議、而認此會議為根據現行條約召開軍縮本會議之延長的會議、潛水艦及商船等附屬的問題、將於根本問題解决後着手審議亦不遲、英國如此言動、莫非表示露骨意見、日本欲退可退、如不退出須應參加造艦通吿案之審議、會議决不因日本之退出而吿終結、日本如出於退出會議之舉支、不必參加共同宣言、潛水艦商船等問題之恊定、日本代表因英國突然表示如此強硬態度不讓步、殆無餘地奉政府回訓於圓滿空氣中完給會議、（十五日同盟社電）</p>
<h3>東京將發宣言　向內外闡明立塲</h3>
<p>東京　外務省因十四日深夜接到日代表團公電、今晨十時開外務省首腦部會議之結果、决定卽將開外務海軍聯席會議、於是自十一時起開聯席會議、經恊議之後、决定　於最善時期正式通吿不參加會議、　派遣傍聽員出席今後會議、至下午一時散會、政府內定任命永井全權為傍聽員留英、處理决裂後之一切事務、並進行外交的善後工作、日本正式退出會議之後、將由岡田首相發表聲明書、闡明政府對軍縮意見、要求國民覺悟、廣田外相亦向中外聲明日本愛好國際和平之眞意、並日本常有凖備、如各國諒解日本軍縮方針、隨時可參加新召開之會議、同時大角海相川島陸相分別發表意見、闡明建艦競爭開始後、日本應取經濟及國防方針、要求舉國一致打開難局、（十五日同盟社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　海軍會議日本代表團發言人頃向報界發表談話、闡明該代表團之意嚮云、「日本總代表永野大將、將在海軍會議總委員會、詳細說明日本之提案、及其懷抱之計劃、吾人主張各海軍國因地理形勢及國防需要之不同、得將所擬規定之共同最高額予以調整也、此種計劃如遭拒絕、則會議勢必破裂、吾人退出會議之後、固願留駐觀察員、但此仍須視此項觀察所接之邀請、性質如何而定、吾人極願避免各方情感之更趨惡化、且亦不以為吾人退出會議之結果、海軍造艦競爭卽將開始、目前美國積極造艦、以達到現行條約限度之計劃、雖在日本國內、已引起不安之感、但日本仍無意大事造艦、以與英美兩國海軍並駕齊驅也、是故茍非由其他國家造成海軍競爭之空氣、則日本亦不願為始作俑者也、惟華盛頓曁倫敦兩海國條約、對於日本國防之需要、已證明其不能適應、而華盛頓條約所樹立之海軍比率制、對於日本尤不公允、顧欲延長其效力、使有永久性、吾人誠未見其理由安在也、」云云（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英海軍界　主邀俄德參加</h3>
<p>倫敦　海軍界人士相信、日本將於後日（卽十六日）退出海軍會議之說、在事實上、業已確定不易、唯現行海軍條約、將於本年年杪屆滿、故日本政府、猶有十一個月之時間、以硏究海軍會議之結果、此後日本政府、或將對於海會若干件决議案、表示贊同、亦未可知、（按卽所謂質的限制、潛水艇限制使用規則、太平洋島嶼限制設防條欵延長期限等等、）英國海軍界人士、對於邀請德俄兩國、加入會議之可能、現仍繼續抱有同情之見解、蓋藉此可就互相通知造艦程序、與質的限制之兩案、繼續作一般的洽商也、惟關於此層、在英國方面、迄猶未向其他各國代表提出切實建議、一般人預料、非俟日本退出會議見諸事實、幷向他國代表團試探意見、俾可證明此項程序為各方一般贊同之後、則此問題之究竟、猶未能判然明白也、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美國暫守沉默　將以哲理的態度處之</h3>
<p>華盛頓　日本决定退出海軍會議之消息傳至此間、國務卿赫爾因該國尚未正式提出通知、故不願發表評倫、一般人相信、官塲人士對於此事、將以「哲理」的態度處之、緣自一九三四年底海會初步談判開始舉行以迄今日、日美兩國所採立塲、絕不相容、美國方面早以為海會成功希望、已極微尠、固不待日本退會而始瞭然也、至就海會討論經過情形而言、則兩大英語國家之互相支持、已顯然可覩、此在今後世界政治上、關係實至為重要、據海軍界人士觀察、英美兩國對於質的限制問題、大約可望成立恊立、並已確實决定維持海軍現行比率、一旦日本擴充海軍軍備之時、則每遇該國造艦一艘、英美兩國卽各造兩艘、以資應付、此在兩國財源充裕、遠勝日本、自必能保持其海軍現有優勢也、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>巴黎感覺不安</h3>
<p>巴黎　海軍會議日本代表團决定退出會議、雖其事多少已為所逆料、但消息傳來、此間海軍界人士、莫不為之震動、最近數日以來、海軍界人士猶望日本代表團之態度、或可稍趨和緩、庶使海軍談判、猶留幾分可能性、至是則此種希望、業已打消、且世界海軍最強國之一、旣不能參與其事、則重要之海軍恊定、卽無從簽訂、而海軍會議之重要性、亦卽喪失其大部份矣、同時法國所提出各國互相通知一年內造艦程序與質的限制之建議、其前途將若何乎、關於此層、海軍界人士、亦頗感不安、惟一般人以為、此際預料海會未來進展情形、猶屬言之過早耳、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>維護遠東利益　對日暗送秋波</h3>
<p>巴黎　名記者塔布衣夫人、頃在事業報發表長文、就倫敦海軍會議有所評論、略謂法國在遠東與中國尤其在越南、置有利益、故允宜與日本維持最良好之關係、日本若果退出海軍會議、而由英·美·法·意·四國賡續開會、則法國代表務當注意、毋任今後之會議轉具反日意味、「至於法國之提案、就吾人前此所表示之意見而觀、則異日所可發展之途徑、得以歸納如下、卽法國對於日本代表所要求之海軍平等權利、在原則上並不反對、特此項原則所包含之問題、旣非海軍會議職權範圍以內的事、且在實際上亦不能獲得解决者、法國代表有鑒於斯、故對日本提案不欲加以贊成、抑在實際上、法國所提由各國互換造艦情報之提案、其近似日本提案之處、實遠在英國提案之上、不過法日兩案之間有一主要區別、卽法國要求海軍最高額、僅由五大海軍國共之、而日本則主張全世界各國無分軒輊、均當以此項最高額為凖則耳、」塔布衣夫人嗣謂、法國始終認為陸軍軍備與海軍軍備、實為輔車於依、必須同時兼顧、是以對於歷屆海軍會議從未過存奢望、其於此次倫敦海軍會議尤不敢多所期待云、（十五日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<h3>農村生活叢談</h3>
<p>— 俞主棠主編</p>
<p>一個停着不進的農村裏的生活　尤蔚祖</p>
<p>時代的巨輪，不停地轉着，一切一切，都隨着時代而前進，可是，我故鄉佃農的生活姿態，依然還停在那一段和我幼年時所耳濡目染的一樣，甚至和我父親，祖父幼年時候的一樣。這個「依然故我」的老大農村，究竟是一個不知有晋的桃花源呢？還是一個滿地荆棘之鄉呢？請看下面的叙述，他們究竟過的是怎樣的生活。</p>
<p>我的故鄉，是江蘇泰縣東北的一個農村，它雖然僻居大江之北，祇需兩日的路程，就可直達政治中心的首都，和商業中心的上海。在交通方面，還不能說是十分閉塞。年來鄉間地主的公子哥兒，拿着農民的脂膏去向都市換回學士方帽者，亦頗不少，在表面看來，文化方面，已不能算是十分落後。但一檢視大多數的佃農生活，不禁令人「啼笑皆非」。</p>
<p>次佃農的痛苦　普通一船的佃農，平日頗受壓迫，然而我鄉的佃農，除受普通的壓迫外，還要受狐假虎威的管莊先生的剝削，管莊先生是我鄉大地主雇傭專司田務方面的一個職員，所有收租，召佃等權限，地主悉委之於他。因此，可憐的佃農，忍受了管莊者不少的苛求。管莊者領了地主的俸薪，還要佃農年納每畝八分的供飯錢，佃農朝哺晚育賴以副產的幾只肥鷄，也要每年敬送兩隻，名爲年鷄，這都是彰明較著的載在租約上面的。除此之外，還有一種，「心照不宣」的剝削，在他主持收租的時候，另有一副「天曉得」的大秤巨斗，可憐的農民也祇得在其吆喝聲下，不斷的將一汗一粒的租穀，向秤上增添，不敢支吾。</p>
<p>乞丐的氣燄　他們除對管莊先生的剝削不敢作聲外，連那强討惡化的乞丐—也可說是窮光蛋—，亦畏若蛇蝎，不敢抗拒，眞不啻孝子賢孫似的有求必應。因爲稍拂其意，準會在最短期間，呌你遭「墻黔壁赭」之災。他們爲維護那易遭毒手的茅舍與田塲收穫的草堆，在沒有組織狀况之下，祗得聽憑惡化者公然以「放火」來威嚇，百般忍受。雖然，距離不遠的街鎭，設有公安機關，但是他們維護豪紳猶恐不及，焉有餘暇注意此「化外」鄉農？</p>
<p>吃茶講理錢遭瘟　窮人間的糾紛很多，常常爲了一點芝蔴大的事，爭執口角，牽涉了大批親友，在「公說公有理，婆說婆有理」的局面下，結果是興師動衆，跑到街鎭上去吃茶講理，這時自有一般常川駐館的專賴評理爲生的「專家」，可不待申請，自來鼓其如簧之舌，顚倒是非的說得頭頭是道，負氣的雙方，就在以金錢爲公理的評理條伴下，聽其月旦，結果是兩造洋錢白化多少，除却茶館裏多進一筆小帳外，一般白會評理家又可多一進財的機會。</p>
<p>勞力無代價「半年辛苦半年閑」這句話，其中含有不少歌頌豔羨農人的意思，可是那裏知道；可憐的農民，一日不得三餐，就發生在這「半年閑」的時期中，到了秋收登塲之後，大家有力無處賣，爲怕坐吃山空，祇得三頓减爲兩餐，乾飯變成薄粥。這時候無論男女老幼，但求一日溫飽，他們可出賣一日勞力，不取分文代價。假如有人雇他渡過殘冬和新春，除不要工資外，還要向你戚恩不盡。</p>
<p>衣著的來源在鷄蛋　他們娶了一房兒媳，就給她飼養母鷄一隻，從此她們衣著的源泉，就仰賴此鷄生蛋所賜，在此蛋價低落，銅元充斥的市面之下，至少要凑滿六七十個鷄蛋，方能換洋一元，最多也不過添衣一襲。假使再生兒育女，所入如何能敷所出，因之不得不穿的是滿身結補，他們並不是有異於一般性女愛美的習性，實在他們是另有苦衷。記得一位農婦，因爲他的鷄子瘟死了，哭得「如喪考妣」，旁人笑她痴哭，可是，笑的人並不曾替她一想其衣著源泉斷送之傷心。</p>
<p>儲蓄式的婚姻　在「早生兒子早見孫」的傳統觀念下，他們儲蓄式的婚姻，未始不是他們解决婚姻問題的一個不得已的聰明辦法，所謂儲蓄式的婚姻，是他們在孩子小的時侯，就替他訂成配偶，一切財禮，就採取儲蓄式的零存整付的方法，由男方每節分送，以免臨娶時整批抽撥之苦。這誠然是他們解决婚姻問題的一個辦法，可是就在這買賣式的制度下，聽其自然的產生了「衣不足食不飽」的小國民，在社會學家看來，又要認爲造是不易解决的人口問題。</p>
<p>開門祇有兩件事　開門七件事，「柴，米，油，鹽，醬，醋，茶，」這是說明每家一日的基本開支，但是他們根本談不到「五味調和百味香」，所以對於「油醬醋」三件事，從不想問津，照理最基本的「柴米鹽」三件不能再缺，可是鹽價貴到每斤四百六十文，更加鹽盆子仗恃專賣而暗尅斤兩，在鹽棧裏一斤可買十六兩，在鹽盆子裏至少打一八折。富紳們可向遠處鹽棧裏萬購，貧苦的農民，半斤八兩一買，祇得遭受幾重明漲暗加的剝削，因爲經不起這樣的虧累，結果祇得望鹽興嘆。明知無鹽不能下咽，但在不得已的限制下，不得不暫行戒鹽，所以他們的一日飲食，只有再不可少的「柴米」兩件事而已。無怪遇有人家拋棄臭不可聞的鹹菜與醬渣，他們要認爲不潔之物，而常生病症，這也許是老天慈悲而特開方便之門。</p>
<p>私塾的餘勢　每個農家，在其子女隊中，總要送一個云拜師入塾，他並不是奢望他的兒子「跳龍門考狀元」，更不是想在家中留一讀書種子開導一家文化；他的作用，却在籍此結納村塾夫子，從此大小各事便於請他帮忙，除寫帳帖對聯爲塾師分內之事外，假如遇有婚喪大事，塾師還是爲當然的顧問。一個塾師除却擔任敎書外，還要兼有星相醫卜諸學，恐怕就是「諸葛」再世，也要敬謝不敏，可是塾師爲保存飯碗計，只好糊天糊地，强不知以爲知，因此，鬧笑話的事，在我的家鄉是時常會發現的。因爲夫子的雜務紛繁，兼差太多，對其門人的課業，不得不大打其折，一暴十寒，好在家屬之意不在書本，就是入塾三年，而目不識丁，也無人起與責難。現在雖然取締不良私塾命令已傳入鄉間，可是學校的敎師，不能適合他們的口胃，所以私塾的餘勢，至今猶在。</p>
<p>上面的情形不祗是我的故鄉的一縣農村是如此，恐怕江蘇或整個中國的農村都和這樣的情形大同小異罷？現在他們還在「不知如何致此」的謎中生活肴，雖然似乎現在還很安靜的在那裏忍耐着，可是，這不啻是一顆沒有遇着導火綫的炸彈在那裏深埋着，所以我希望當道諸公力謀救濟改良的辦法，不要忘了這一羣不聲不響的可變餓虎的馴羊，更不要忘了實際對農村有補的力量——農民敎育——。</p>

<p>諸位聽衆，今天要講的題目是「中小學本國史敎授的目標」。我國古來對於歷史一項，向來認爲獨立的學科，因爲我國學者，向以窮經爲一切學問主體，古史的村料，多不離乎經籍，讀史不過作爲窮經的注脚罷了。自從淸朝來年，模仿東西各國的學制，才把歷史一門，獨立起來。情光緒二十九年淸政府頒行重訂學堂章程，自天學以至小學，皆設立歷史一學科。其敎授本國史的目標，在初等小學堂，大抵在略舉古來聖主賢君重大美善的事蹟，使知本國文化的由來，和本朝君主的德政，以養成國民忠愛的本源；並主張先講鄉士歷史，採取本境內鄉賢，名宦，流寓諸名人中，能令敬仰嘆慕增長志氣的事蹟，加以解說？以激動其希賢慕聖的心理。在高等小學方面，在陳述黃帝堯舜以來歷朝治亂興衰的大略，使知古今世界的變遷；允注重於本朝的政治，使知本朝君主德澤的深厚，以養成國民自强的志氣，忠愛的生情。在中學校方面，主張先授本國史，專舉歷代帝王的大事，陳述本朝君主的善政德澤；和本國百年以內的大事，决講古今忠良賢哲的事蹟以及學術技藝的隆簪，武術的馳張，政治的沿革，農工商事的進境，風俗的變遷等，凡敎歷史者，注意在發明實事的關係，辨明文化的由來，使得省悟强弱興亡的道理，以振發國民的志氣。</p>
<p>自政體改革以來，情勢頗有不同。民國五年，政府規定高等小學方面主張略授黃帝開國的功續。歷代偉人的言行，亞東文化治體的淵源，和近百年來中外的關係，其要旨在使兒童知道國體的大要，兼養成國民的志操。中學方面，授以歷代政治文化遞演的現象和其重要事蹟。其要在使學生知道歷史上重要事蹟，明於人羣的進化，社會的變遷，邦國的盛衰，允宜注意於政治的因革，和國家建立的本源。</p>
<p>自國民革命以後，情勢又有不同，二十一年國民政府頒布中小學課程標準小學方面，將歷史包括社會科中，使兒童在環境所接觸和想像所能及的古今人生活，古今文物制度，古今歷史大事，紀念日，國恥史，民族運動史，時事等，探討，比較，記載，發表等，使兒童了解國家民族的歷史演進，培養兒童愛護國家，努力自衛的精神。初中方面敎授目標的有下列三點：　在研求本國歷史的演進；特別說明其歷史上的光榮，及近代所受列强侵略的經過與原因，以激發學生民挨復興的思想，且培養其自信自覺發揚光大的精神。　叙述本國文化演進的概况。特別說明其對於世界文化的貢獻，使學生明瞭吾先民偉大的事蹟，以養成高尚的志趣，與自强不息的精神。　叙述各時代文化的變遷，應特別說明現代政治制度，及經濟狀况的由來，以確立學生對於民權主義民生主義的信念。高中方面，除續初中所規定的目標以外，特別注意下列各點：　叙述我國民族的拓展，與歷史文化政治社會的變遷，以說明本國現狀的由來，而闡發三民主義之歷史的根據；　注重近代外交失敗的經過，及政治經濟諸問題的起源，以說明本國國民革命的背景，指示今後本國民族應有的努力；　過去的政治經濟諸問題，其有影響於現代社會者，應特別注意，使學生得由歷史事實的啟示，以研討現代問題，並培養其觀察判斷的能力。</p>
<p>根據上述各項歷史敎育的目標，我們對於中小學本國史敎授的目標，應該注意於下列各點：</p>
<p>應該發揚民族的精神國家的建立，應該注意民族主義的推行，我們要提倡民族主義，必以講述歷史專實爲其原動力。自從十八世紀以來，普魯士爲欲建立一個統一的國家，於是有普魯士學派史學的發生，這派史學的宗旨，就在發揚普魯士的民族精神，當時史家如特羅生的普魯士政治史，齊勃爾的德意志國會的基礎等書，他的內容，都是發揚普魯士民族的精神。特賚切克的十九世紀德意志史，更張大旦耳曼主義，並且倡導普魯士當爲日耳曼民族領袖的學說，德意志就賴以統一，同時意大利諸邦的志士，因企圖國家的統一，史學界亦大顯其民族主義的色彩，史學家如勃爾波，雷勃拉里請人，不但直接參預獨立運動，灑其熱血，並且成爲史著，廣爲宣傳，以促成意大利的獨立建國運動。</p>
<p>總理嘗說，「我們鑒於古今民族生活的道程，要救中國，想中國民族永遠存在，必要提倡民族主義，如果再不留心提倡民族主義結合四萬萬人成一個堅固的民族，中國便有亡國滅種之憂，我們要挽救這種危亡，便要提倡民族主義，用民族精一神來救國，」總理道段訓示，說得十分透澈，年來敎育當局，已經明白的實行民族主義的敎育，而歷史敎育上所負的使命，最爲重大，歷史敎育的目標雖有多端，而發揚其民族的精神，以激勵其團結的情緒，堅定其自信的能力，藉以引起其愛護種族的觀念，以爲復興民族的基礎，誠爲我國目下國難期間應有的努力，其努力的逕途，在消極的方面，應該調和各族的情感；在積極方面，應該樹立中心的文化。</p>
<p>我國民族，久經同化，本無所謂種界。自從淸季以來，始有所謂漢滿蒙回藏等的名詞，民國成立，昌用五族的名稱，嗣後歷史敎科書中，以五族並列，或加苗族爲六族、或加韓族爲七族，亦有加越族爲八族者，並且分述其根據的地域，和其個別的系統，雖其所包含的範圍，廣狹不同，流弊所及，形成對峙的現象，造成分裂的趨勢。總理以爲欲實行民族主義，常以美國爲模範，國內各民族，必須平等待遇，在平等待遇之先，須做一番調和的工作，便是放棄漢族的名稱，另造一民族名稱曰「中華民族」如是，我們可以建立一民族的國家，而其人亦皆爲國家的民族。其實所謂漢滿蒙回藏等名稱，或爲地方上的名詞，或爲宗敎上的名詞，而非民族的名詞，旣非民族的名詞，自當一律禁用，代以現行行政區域的名稱，例如所謂滿族，可分別稱爲遼寗人，吉林人，黑龍江人，所謂藏族，可分別稱爲前藏人，後藏人，所謂回族，可分別稱爲新疆人，靑海人，如所謂漢族的分別稱爲浙江人江蘇人，沒有差異，至於所謂各民族間事蹟的叙述，亦當避免爭鬥的事實，注意於互相同化的趨向以明造成今日整個中華民族的經過，不可妄分地域，任植統系，民族感情，自可逐漸調和。</p>
<p>造成整個民族的基本條件，雖在調和民挨的感情，但欲造成一種堅强的民族團體，必須樹立其文化的中心，在昔各族的同化，純係所謂漢族者的文明爲其文化的中心，實際所謂漢族，已成爲各族混合以後的一個總民族。總理以爲我們旣欲實行民族主義，當以漢人的文明，另造一五族混合的新民族，如懼滿蒙等懷疑及於併蓉，則必出以平等的待遇。我們應該本此原則，以從事於歷史敎育的改進，即以三民主義爲其文化創造的中心，歷史敎材注重各族先哲的事功言行，研究其文化的程度，生活的狀况，以爲互相融合改進的資料。</p>
<p>應該養成國家的觀念，國家的成立，除具備領土人民主權三種要素而外，還要有一種强面的政治組織，這種國家觀念的養成，亦以歷史敎育爲其主要的工具，歐洲各國在十九世紀的初年，已將歷史敎育作爲提倡愛國精神的學科，注重於本國史的講授，例如普魯士大學家利特爾說：「本國史在所有我們的學校裏面，統應該講授的，他（指本國史）在我們大學裏面，亦應該有一個地位；愛國的人，應該常常提及他，我們的目的就是要養成一種親愛同尊重現在制度的精神，不懂本國史的人，無論一件什麼公務，我們不應該付託他」。同時史家格提充，亦有本國史應佔第一個位置的論調。而可爾勞須編的普通學校德國史，先講德國同拿破崙衝突的失敗，再講勝利，能將讀者的精神大大的激勵，這書自從一八一六年（嘉慶二十一年）出版以後，立刻大受歡迎，而且成爲許多初等和高等歷史敎科書的模範。法國在拿破崙時，對於普通公民亦有一種歷史的講授，在一八零六年（嘉慶十一年）出版的欽定問答體敎科書，列舉基督敎徒對於他們君主應盡的義務，而以保護國家爲前提，並有「我們有沒有特別的用心，使得我們格外忠於我們的黃帝拿破崙第一」的問題。愛國精神，事實上變爲一個學校中講授歷史的主要目的，到了十九世紀中葉以後，這種精神的影響，格外顯著，小學校歷史課程的規定，差不多都是本國史。</p>
<p>日本在明治維新以前，幕府擅權，封建的制度尚未泯滅，於是德川家著大日本史，主張尊王攘夷，忠君愛國，羣相鼓吹，於是「倒幕論」普及全國，淺見綱齋因之著靖獻遺言，備述中國古烈士之事蹟，以鼓舞國民的愛國精神，山縣大貳，頓山陽諸名流又從而響應之，因此倒慕空氣，益爲囂張，幕府旣倒，維新局面，賴以成功，日本史家向自稱爲吳太伯或徐福之後爲榮，其後喜言國體，俱削而不書，文部省常令那珂通世等，編著日本歷史，從新作東洋史，以提高國民自尊和自信的心理，所以日俄戰後，即有「日本的强盛，由於日本歷史助成」的論調。　　（未完）</p>

<h3>上海之調味粉業（續）</h3>
<p>— （上海工商業槪况之九）　中國徵信主編</p>
<p>五、天生滋味素廠—該廠成立於民國二十年六月、由林雙泉、李憇棠，李祖蔭，曹嘉儒等發起組織，初創時範圍不大，資本僅二萬八千元，嗣後逐年增加，最近改組為有限公司，資本加至十萬元，該廠製造廠設在虹鎭飛虹路張家宅，發行所設於西安路三和里。該廠係租地造屋，基地面積約四畝九分，建有廠屋三四十間，內置爐子四只，馬達三架，及軋聽蒸粉等機。其出品為滋味素，副產品為滋味汁，醬油精，皆以豆麥為商標。開業以還，適當「一二八」戰後，市况衰落之秋，營業未見充分發展，邇後則尚活躍。</p>
<p>六、天元久記味素廠—該廠於民國二十一年成立，資本五萬元，係孫承甫等合辦，經理為楊秉襄，廠長為丁桂生，均有股本加入。該廠原為獨資，於二十二年改為合夥組織。廠屋係租地建造，有平房六七間，佔地三畝許，每年租金一千餘元，出品共有二種，一為王冠牌之味王，一為百合牌之味鮮，近年因營業審愼，頗有起色。</p>
<p>除上述六廠之外，滬上雖尚有二三小廠，但與市面絕少關係，</p>
<p>三、原料及其市價</p>
<p>調味粉業之原料，主要者為麪粉，鹽酸，苛性鈉，火酒，炭粉，硫化鈉及純碱等。麪粉大都採用美粉，委托洋行定購，以其粉質黏性較國產為優。鹽酸一項，以前悉用日貨，但自天原電化廠開辦後，大都皆改向該廠採購。去年鹽酸價格下跌，國貨最低價曾跌至五元四角。自法幣實施後，價格回漲，日貨七元，國貨六元五角（以上皆以二罐一百二十磅計價）往時售價曾為十五元左右，去年猛跌五元許，迨新法幣出現後，始吿回漲，火酒以往來自爪哇，但自中華酒精廠之國產問世後，外貨輸入較少，今國產每加侖售洋一元一角餘。純碱十九皆賴外貨，以往英國佔據首席，邇來日貨輸入最多，市價亦以日貨為標凖。目下市價，（以二百磅一袋計價）日貨七元二角，項貨七元七角，國貨則僅七元。</p>
<p>此外調味粉廠尚需裝置味粉之玻璃與洋鐵聽，故亦為其附屬原料，今將其種類及售價列表如左，以供參考：</p>
<p>注：洋鐵聽分子各廠大都皆委託康元製罐廠代製。</p>
<p>四、銷路及推銷方法</p>
<p>自調味粉問世後、國人以其味鮮質美，均樂於購用。據業中人稱，近年滬上各廠全年生意約有四百萬元，其出品除行銷全國外，並運銷南洋及香港等地。近來美國亦有運往，其銷路不可謂不廣。良以歐美各國尚未有該項製品，吾國廠商如能團結一致，向國際市場發展，前途實有極大希望也。茲將各處銷路情形，條述如下：</p>
<p>本埠—本埠各南貨店雜貨店均有調味粉出售，各廠出品俱備，惟國貨銷路並不甚廣。據云全年貨銷總額僅四五十萬元左右，蓋以日貨「味　素」仍在優勢之故。</p>
<p>外埠—外埠銷路，向以廣州，厦門，汕頭，天津，漢口為最佳，惟目前因各地抵制日貨運動，均已中止，銷路又為日貨優奪，尤以貨北為最，華中各埠，雖較緩和，但因經濟衰落，農村破產，銷路亦較前大减。</p>
<p>國外—國外如香港，新加坡，小呂宋仰光等處，華僑頗多，天府廠與天一廠曾相繼推銷，成績頗佳。不意近年來因南洋一帶橡膠業與錫鑛業之衰落，一般華僑之購買力亦頓形减低。同時復受日商之打擊，貨銷减至四五十萬元，故前途非常黯淡，美國方面，近由上海華茶公司推銷，但銷路尚未推廣，（年僅十餘萬元）其他各國，以調味粉為不衛生，尚未採用至推銷方法，大別有二，即雇用跑街向各商店兜銷，及委託商號經理是也。中國化學工業社在外埠設立分店及經售處甚多。天一味母廠除本外埠代售商鋪外，且雇用跑街推銷。天生滋味素廠，本埠委託廣東路悅來及河南路春陽兩南貨店經售。太乙麥精粉廠，以本埠為主要銷路，委託商號包銷，此各廠推銷方法之大槪也。</p>
<p>凡南貨店或雜貨店向廠方批購味粉時，廠方一律給以二成回佣，外埠亦同，至正式回佣外之暗扣，則各廠不同，新立四廠為求銷路之推廣，其暗扣皆較老廠為大，此蓋與各種香烟之贈劵同其作用也。</p>
<p>五、市價之漲落</p>
<p>去年味粉市價，一般皆較前年為低，所幸各項原料，其市價下跌之速度更甚，故各廠不受若何影響，同時自新貨幣政策頒佈以後，市價又轉趨上漲。若一般購買力，能不减退，則該業前途，希望甚大也，今將通行法幣前後市價同列於後，以資比較，</p>

<h3>英國小學體育科分隊訓練法（一）</h3>
<p>— 胡祖蔭</p>
<p>本文係參考英國敎育部出版之英國小學體育科敎材細目一書書中第二章寫成　組者附誌</p>
<p>分隊訓練乃是將一班兒童、根據他們不同的興趣、或能力等、分成若干小隊、施以適當的訓練、在髁育敎學的活動中、分隊訓練是一種必要的訓練方法、分隊訓練的需要可從下列四個理由中證明、</p>
<p>班中人數衆多敎師不能顧至全體、需要分隊訓練體育敎師常是領導四五十個學生上課、在學生擁擠的小學裏、有時一班學生會多至六七十人、在這樣人數衆多的一班中、體育敎師耍想將全體學生個別地加以訓練、非但要浪費全班的時間、而且還要影饗一班的秩序、因此不能不需要分隊訓練、</p>
<p>兒童的興趣與能力各有不同、需要分隊訓練兒童之間各有不同的興趣、這是明顯的事實、兒童之間非但有不同的興趣、而且也有能力上的差別、所以在一班兒童之中、我們正可根據他們不同的興趣和能力、施以分隊訓練、以適應個性的需耍、</p>
<p>另女生混合敎學不便、需要分隊訓練從生理的發展上看、男女生混合在一起學習體育活動、定有不便的地方、再從社會的環境方面看來、男女生在共同參加體育活動時、定有許多地方不肯合作、所以在有男女生同學的學校、體育活動亦以分隊訓練爲宜、</p>
<p>養成兒童合作與領袖的能力、需要分隊訓練、分隊訓練的最大結果、就在養成兒童合作與領袖的能力、反過來說、耍養成兒童合作與領袖的能力、就需要分隊訓練、分隊訓練怎樣能養成兒童合作與領袖的能力、這一點將在後幾節討論、</p>
<p>二、分隊訓練的目的</p>
<p>分隊訓練的目的是要訓練兒童發展自動的能力、合作的習慣、和資任心、在施行此種訓練時、耍能使每個兒童切實地明瞭他個人應負的責任和應做的工作、假如每個兒童能了解、他是在合作促成一種迅速和有效率的組織、以及他是在獨立地練習發展地的表演能力、這就有了正當的基礎、</p>
<p>三、分隊訓練的開始</p>
<p>分隊訓練已經在英國許多地方施行多時、而且很有成效、根據過去的經騐、假如敎師能够指引兒童一種簡單的和具體的目的、並能避免過分的形式上的手續、那麼、分隊訓練就不妨在小學中高年級開始、在施行此種訓練時、要切產避免呆板的摹仿手續、假如兒童在小學中得着基本的自動練習、他們將來到中學時當能分外發展自動練習的能力、例如、某級兒童假如受了基本的分隊訓練、將來這班兒童在學習游泳或運動時、就能多多發展自動練習的能力、他們能離開敎師自動地去練習、並能充分地表現創造的能力和常識、　（未完）</p>

<h3>小男兒（一）（五）（三）</h3>
<p>— 鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>他仰頭看着她，眼睛裏有一種奇怪的神情，混雜了得意，感激和憂戚的情緒，——她當時看了眞是不懂，可是以後永不能忘記的。</p>
<p>「我怕你要失望的，可是我總勉力，」他說，闔住了那簿冊，沒有一點歡喜的表示，但這正是他以前所最愛看，也最愛講談的資料呢。</p>
<p>「你不舒服嗎？」蜀夫人以一手放在她的一肩問道。</p>
<p>「我的脚有點兒作痛；我想我還是去睡吧。明天再會，師母，」他又說道，隨以那個手抵住他的頰，半嚮之後方始走去，彷彿他對某種珍愛的品物，已作最孩的永訣了。</p>
<p>「可憐的唐恩！他對乃德的受辱，抱着極深的同情，他是一個奇怪的孩子；不知我可能十分了解他？」蜀夫人自言自語道，一面想起唐恩近來的進步，確甚滿意，然而叉覺得那個童子却不如她以前所想的那麼普通。</p>
<p>有一件事最使乃德傷心的是韜摩的一樁舉動，因爲韜摩在失竊以後，會以和氣而卻堅定的口吻對他說道：</p>
<p>「我不願傷你的感情，乃德，不過你知道我不堪受金錢的損失，所以我想我們是再不能合夥了，」說了韜摩隨手抹去了牌號上「公司」的字樣。</p>

<h3>再談民族自覺運動</h3>
<p>— 葉青</p>
<p>所謂民族自覺，就是民族的自己認識。它之發生，正同我們對於一切事物的認識一樣，依著這兩個原則：　認識在事物存在之後；　認識起於事物的刺激。</p>
<p>因為第一個原則，所以在世界上總是先有民族而後繼有民族自覺。從發展歷程上看，民族的存在可分為兩個階段：自在的民族和自覺的民族。它們是怎樣推移的呢？關鍵在於民族的矛盾。</p>
<p>在若干民族並立的時代，一個民族的利益往往建築在別的民族利益的攫取上面。而由於這樣，就有了被壓迫的民族。它覺得要抵抗壓迫繼能生存。於是就不得不喚起民族中人共同奮鬥。這時的呼聲是：我們受別的民族壓迫了，我們這個民族快快覺悟起來，團結起來！</p>
<p>這不是依著認識的第二個原則的嗎？</p>
<p>明白這點，就可知道為甚麼歐洲的民族自覺運動出現於法國拿破侖蹂躪歐洲各民族之後，中國的民族主義出現於歐美和日本的帝國主義先後侵略中國好幾十年之後了。</p>
<p>所以民族自覺運動是一種從意識上反對侵略者的生存鬥爭。在今天則是殖民地和半殖民地喚起人反對帝國主義以獲得民族解放的文化運動。因為今天的侵略者是帝國主義，它的殖民地和半殖民地是被壓迫民族。所以這個運動當然也是一種生存鬥爭。</p>
<p>如果要問我們今天是否還需要這個運動，那就要問我們是否已從帝國主義的壓迫中解放出來。這是誰也會答出一個否字來的。而且在近幾年中，我們還遭受到更嚴重的侵略。連努力於經濟榨取的帝國主義所允許我們的領土和行政的完整都不可保。侵略程度實在達到了空前的地步！</p>
<p>在這種情形中，還不需要反對帝國主義嗎！反對帝國主義還不需要喚起廣大的羣眾以造成整個的力量來實現民族的革命嗎？</p>
<p>所以民族自覺運動在現在達到了空前的需要程度。這是生存的鬥爭，為每個智識者所應參加。只有由民族自覺運動造成民族革命運動把帝國主義打倒了，我們在物質生活上繼有改良的可能。試想：不打倒帝國主義，則不平等條約無法廢除，已失的土地和利權不能收回，並且關稅沒有自主，幼稚的國民經濟得不着保護，普遍的失業無法救濟，有甚麼方法可以使不能生活的人能生活，過最苦生活的人過較好生活呢？</p>
<p>當然，我們不只有口腔和腸胃，而且有感官和頭腦。所以除過物質生活外，還要過精神生活，但在救死惟恐不贍時，怎能談得到精神生活呢？如果要獲得它，只有從反對帝國主義起。并且我們現在很基本的事情——要擺脫奴隸命運和劣種頭銜而在人類中獲得平等的人格。使精神上舒展一下，也只有反對帝國主義之一途！</p>
<p>要生活嗎？要改良生活嗎？要做人嗎？問題的答覆只有一個：反對帝國主義。不然，那就是當奴隸，當魚肉，任隨帝國主義壓迫和宰割。此外是沒有第三條路的。</p>
<p>那末努力民族自覺運動吧！那裏有自由，平等，幸福在期待我們！</p>
<h3>齊桓公和老木匠</h3>
<p>— 川麟</p>
<p>—見莊子外篇天道第十三—</p>
<p>這天早上，齊桓公心緒很好，取了一冊書，坐在大堂上朗朗地高誦起來。</p>
<p>他越讀越得意，抹著鬍子，不住的晃頭擺腦，每讀這一句便悠悠地拖了一個長聲。</p>
<p>大堂底下的院子裏，七十歲的老木匠扁，左手拿柄鏧子，右手拿個鐵錐精神飽滿地正在打一個車輪椎子的聲音很有韻律地在空氣中丁丁地響着。</p>
<p>忽然的，當他的鏧子正要下去時候，齊桓公的書聲怪難聽的刺入他的耳鼓，把他椎子和鏧子的韻律攪亂了。他擰了一擰，鏧子在車輪上蹩了一下。</p>
<p>「唔？」他朝上一望，瞧見大王爺正襟危坐的在念書他瞅了一眼又復繼續工作下去。</p>
<p>「嘮…嘮」…「嘮…」齊桓公的書聲更響了起來，似乎一陣蜜蜂在耳旁嗡嗡地叫着，他覺得有一些頭痛，幾乎在車輪上被蹩了一下。</p>
<p>「呃！」他不耐煩了。放下了椎和鏧子，拍拍衣襟向大堂走去。</p>
<p>「大王！」</p>
<p>齊桓公正念得高興，被他一叫很不樂意向他瞪了一眼問道：「做甚麼？」</p>
<p>大王，你念的是甚麼書呀？</p>
<p>「唔？」齊桓公一想「這老頭兒幹嗎呀？敢莫是我的書聲感動了他嗎？可是聖人的話是有力的」於是提一提嗓子大聲地說：</p>
<p>「這是聖人的書呀！」</p>
<p>「嘿！那末聖人老子在哪裏呢？大王」</p>
<p>「這傻子」齊桓公一笑。「聖人早已死了！」他又大聲地回答說。</p>
<p>「那末……」老木匠扁也笑了一笑說「大王讀的可不是古人糟粕嗎？」</p>
<p>「甚麽話。」這一　把大　惹怒了，他拍了一木桌子，厲聲地叫：「寡人在這兒讀書，你這個小小木匠也要發甚麼議論嗎！哼！看你有道理就說來，說不出叫你這老王八立刻死！」大王幾乎要跳起來了。</p>
<p>老木匠躬了一躬緩緩地說：「小的是木匠，就來講木匠的話吧。我們打車輪的，敲得慢，輪子就不堅固；敲得快，又會急而不入；必須要不快不慢，心手相應才行。可是怎樣才能夠不快不慢心手相應，這可不是口說得出來的。自然有種手法在這中間，小的也無從去教給小的的兒子，小的的兒子也不能跟我學得去，所以小的到了七十歲還是在鏧車輪子。大王，從前的人已經死了，這從前的法子是不能傳的了，就是傳了下來現在已經不是從前了，這有甚麼用處呢？你又不能把現在變成從前。……這樣說來，你大王所念的可不是從前人的糟粕麼？……」</p>
<p>「……」齊桓公沒得話說，瞪着眼怔怔的看着他。</p>
<h3>論百部佳作</h3>
<p>— 珧華</p>
<p>現已停刊之「人間世」雜誌，最後數期中有百部佳作之徵求，這件事很引起了一部分人的注意，許多名流學者著作家以及文人等都將自己認為「佳」的書籍推舉出來，更有幾位把所舉出的書，作了一段短短的介紹式的批評，將每一書的真價值指示出，期望着人間世社的最後的決定。但人間世社已宣告結束，此項工作就不免擱置了。</p>
<p>開書目這件事對於讀書者有什麼益處？這問題的答案真不容易說。清末張之洞的書目答問是書目書的老前輩，有人因讀了而得治國學的途徑，也有人讀了之後衹聽了許多書名，却並不去一翻所推舉的書，因此覺得如過眼煙雲，毫無用處。近一些如民國初年梁任公胡適之兩先生都曾開過一個國學書目，那是為清華學校留美學生而開的，但結果呢，梁胡兩先生都不免太書生氣，所舉的書目設一小小的國學圖書館而有餘，教留美學生如何讀法？但在專修國學者看來，却確能將研究國學的基本書羅列在內，尤其是梁任公所草的國學入門書及其讀法，將每書何處當精讀，何處當瀏覽，何處可讀，何處不可讀，某書有何參考書，某書有何讀法，都詳細舉出，真是治國學者的一件寶貝。我本人就受過這書目的幫助，因此很覺開書目這件事對於讀書者是很有用的，假使這書目是開得精當的話。</p>
<p>衹要仔細的想想，書目對於讀者的益處是很多的，第一可以不受書賈的欺騙，我知道有許多青年他們買書的動機，是由於書局的誘人的廣告，但書局的廣告是否可靠，就很難說，至少也已將壞處藏好，衹露出種種好處來，因此，一張書目就可以破除書賈的欺騙。第二個益處是接着來的，便是不浪費光陰去讀不好或無用的書，因為書目裏沒有這種書的。第三，因為買書之前已經過了選擇，所買的都有相當的價值的書，當然可以節省買書的費用。更因為選定的書都是有價值有意義的，那更增加了讀者對於讀書的興趣，這是第四個益處。最後一點，也是最重要的，便是使學者從最正當的路徑去研究他所需要的學識。或者有人要說，學術界上沒有所謂正統派的：同樣是為整個社會的病所開的藥方，你不能說釋迦的佛教哲學不對而說馬克思的社會主義，也不能說基爾特社會制度的不對，而說技術統治（Technocracy）的制度時，他們都有他們本身的價值，在相當的環境之下，他們是可以完全對的，而在另一個情形下，或許這藥方對於病有百害而無一利，但就研究學識的立場而言，好的藥方固然要看，而壞的藥方也當知道，不要臨到自己開藥方時將壞的藥方開出，那就貽害不淺了。這種見解，固是不錯。但要知道一本真正的佳書是不應當有偏見的，這本書介紹一種學說，就衹介紹這種學說，他要將所介紹的東西的真面目顯露出來，而不是要給人家看帶著花臉的裝扮。所以任你基爾特社會吧，技術統治吧，這本書就把他們的本來面目，任他缺唇也好，鬎鬁頭也好，源源本本的讓你自己去看，這樣的書自然是一部佳作。</p>
<p>書目的益處既如此之多，而佳書的標準又當定得比較地高，那末百部佳作的選定，應當不是一個文藝性質的人間世雜誌所能做，而當出一個負有促進全國文化的機關——如中國文化建設協會者——來主持這個挑選，才能得出一張公允精確的書目。</p>
<p>對於挑選，我還有幾句話要說。人間世社徵求之百部佳作標明為最近五十年之作品，這是很對的，因為我國接受和吸收西洋文化，就在這五十年內，換一句話說，這最近五十年是中國文化史上的一個新階段，這時期的文化和以前各時期的截然不同，從這階段裏選出的「佳作」，當然是一個現代人所須要的糧食，但我以為這時期以前的作品和這時期的翻譯書籍，在這張書目裏亦當佔有一相當的地位，否則亦當另選一個舊書書目，一個翻譯書目，才見公允，因為一種文化不是突然而來的，固來的文化，加了外來的因素，才有新文化產生，所以這三類書籍，是開書目者都須顧到的。</p>
<p>其次，假定書目已經開定了，我以為不應當讓這張書目衹成一張書目而已。最好能將這百部書再徵求國內學者通人的公開的批評，然後折衷眾見，將錯者訂正，謬者更正，以期所選定的書真正可稱為「佳作」。這種工作，我想，對於讀者應該算是一種恩惠吧。</p>
<p>或者有人要說，百部佳作選定後，難道百部以外沒有佳作，百部以後新出書籍亦無佳作麼？這話是對的，因為書目是死的，而出版界是活的，差不多每天都有新書出版，那末百部佳作的選定，豈不是足以妨碍中國現在微弱的出版界的生長麼。其實不然，因為百部佳作，衹是指此百部書在選定時看來是一百個最好的作品，在選下公佈之後，或者每年，或者每半年，仍可由主持機關就新出書或舊出而未遭選入書目中者選定若干本——譬如說是十本，那末這十本便可算這一年中的佳作，這正如美國電影界之每年選定十大名片一樣，足以鼓勵電影製作業而決沒有妨碍的可能，而我國的出版界，當然可以因此而　固他的根本，而不致凋零，那有斷傷生命的可能呢？</p>
<h3>書店雜景</h3>
<p>— 李衡之</p>
<p>九　書的價格</p>
<p>書的價格也是生意經中問題之一部分。書的定價本是沒有一定標準的，但各新書店出版的書，其價格水準好像相差無幾。決定書定價多少的因素，主要的是成本，內容如何，好像新書店的經理們尚少注意。不過，自知不需要者，即奉送也不受歡迎，需要者即高價亦購，因而定價較高外，其他的書仿佛都是以篇幅多少作為定價高低標準似的，（裝幀紙張自然也有關係）。</p>
<p>據一般的情形來說，書的定價大部均在成本的四倍至五倍之間。如這本書的稿費，印刷費，紙費等總和第一版以二千本計算，每本成本若是二角，則定價多在一元上下，如書的銷路好，售價又不打折扣，則書業這買賣，真是不壞。在新書業發生的初期，各新書店紛紛開張，就是為了這個緣故。記得當時很少有打折扣的事廉價的機會也不很多，有一個時候，因紙張漲了價，各新書店還來過一套什麼「同業公議，照碼加一」，其盛況可知，現在的「全部新書，一例對折」，「一折八扣」等廉價，在當時讀者心目中！從沒有想到會有這樣好的機會的。</p>
<p>固然，當時書的定價高，書業頗為景氣，但即以現售沒有折扣來說，書店所得的純利，亦並沒有吾人所想像的那末多。例如，定價一元的書，除了少數定在門市部現售的外，批發給同行，至少七折，等收款時，又復來一個回佣及折扣，復加上資本的利息，所得恐已衹有五六角之間，再加開支消耗，倒帳損失，以及前「書店的資本」節中所述，生財賬目的無限制增加，常使初版新書，無利可圖，如抽版稅，甚至還要賠本。又出新書，近於投機，未必全有銷路，如有呆銷的書存在，影響更大。新書店所期望的是再版書，但因中國讀者數量之根本不多，欲思一般的參考書，有萬本以上的銷路，實非易易。因此，新書店能發展成功的，遂也少見。（未完）</p>
<h3>介紹一部中國工學文具書　（中）</h3>
<p>— 鍾怡</p>
<p>這一部書名字叫中國文學年表，是敖士英先生編纂的，二十四年十月初版，才出了第一編四冊，由北平立達書局發行。</p>
<p>敖先生之所以作此書，在他的自跋裏，說得很明白：</p>
<p>「年表之作尚矣。司馬遷史記立十表，梁書王僧虔傳稱其旁行斜上，體仿周譜，是亦三代之遺法也。班范而下，或備或闕。萬斯洞撰歷代史表，例本馬班，補其闕淵年表之用，因之大明，又王之樞等撰歷代紀事年表，齊召南撰歷代帝王年表，吳榮光撰歷代名人年譜，皆本正史之例而推廣之；其裨益於讀史者，豈淺鮮哉。然此或僅次人名，或兼紀事實：居今日而語古代學術。前表則有所不能具焉，是余文學年表之所以作也」。</p>
<p>所以他的這部書，編製方法，也和其他的年表不同。他把全表分做八大欄：</p>
<p>①公暦——這是年代的考證。②朝代及帝號——這是中國年代的考證。③時事紀要——這是時代背景的說明。④作者生⑤作者卒——這兩欄考證作者生卒。⑥作者傳略——這是作者的身世說明。</p>

<h3>對外貿易好轉的檢討</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>據最近海關的報吿，國貨前途有一個很好的現象，那就是對外貿易的好轉，和入超數字的激减，據他發表的統計，是去年十個月來對外貿易輸入總値，計為國幣七八一，五五〇，五四五元較前年同期的八七四，一五四，〇二九元，計减少發二，五六三，四八四元，出口總値為四四四，九九九，九九七元，較去年同時期的四四一，八六五，八五〇元，計增加二，一三四，一四七元；照這樣看來，輸入額的大見减少，和輸出額的略見增加，這的確可給予我們頻年從事國貨運動者以很好的安慰，雖然我國國際貿易在整個的形態上，依然還是入趨，然而從這對外貿易已漸趨佳境的徵兆上，衹要今後我們加以更大的努力，一定可使國貨前途進入一個很好的階段云。</p>
<p>不過，入超數字的减落，我們也不能就引為樂觀，我們要曉得，入超的所以形成，其原因就在出口與輸入的不能相抵，現在，照數字上告訴我們，輸入的數量，果已有相當的低减，但是，出口的價値，增加得委實太屬些微，而這種入超的激减，似乎是反而表示我國國內經濟的極度衰落，和人民購買力的益趨薄弱，這是値得我們注意的，到是那久已為人們認為絕望的絲茶兩項，在最近海關發表統計中，去年十個月來却又居出口貨中的首位，絲茶本為我國出口貨內的主幹，其恢復活躍狀態，亦可視為對外貿易漸復常軌的表現的。</p>
<p>所以，在這里，我要指出今後國貨前途的展開，入超的消滅，同時一定要更謀對外貿易的發展，最近滬上中華工業國外貿易恊會，組織國外推銷團，擬先攫南洋展覽，這就是積極進行此項新計劃的具體表現，也是開拓國外市塲的唯一途徑，而我對於這對外貿易漸趨好轉的前途，也就有着兩重深切的展望，那是第一，我國目前的輸出，仍以原料為大宗，工業的製造品，仍未見抬頭，而今後我們務使一般新興機製工業的出品，有在海外立足的市塲，免去被人笑我們僅為「原料供給國」之譏。第二，値此世界工業競爭劇烈之時，我們要謀發展國際貿易，一定要努力改良舊的出品，和廣察各國需要，提倡稱種新出口貨，務使技術改進，出品精美，而製造成本輕减，售價低廉，可易於推銷。</p>
<p>總之。我國對外貿易，雖已略見轉機，但是我國還不可過於樂觀，尚須更大的努力，以謀根本消滅入超的成功。</p>
<p>貢獻話</p>
<h3>安諾德講話之感</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>商標神聖　貨品標凖化　毋忘農村副業　誠信服務之偉大</p>
<p>華三十年之美國商務參　安諾籌君，一昨出席中華國貨產銷恊會講　，約歷一小時半，莊　纔出，滔滔不窮，其所講之者為多語，以貢獻於國貨界者為多，就其　歸，述感如左、</p>
<p>希望注意商標</p>
<p>商標是代表商品的標識，希望國貨廠商，不定商標則已，旣定以後，　尊重此商標之　　，對於出品上千萬不可茍且，須知，一個商標，取得人家信仰，非一朝一夕之功，一且喪失信用，任何力量，不　挽回。安氏之　，至堪回味。</p>
<p>貨品標凖化</p>
<p>任何商品，應於式樣，成色，質料上，有一定之標凖，絲亳不可假借，不得參差，此不僅商業道德為然，在貨品推銷上亦有最大影響。此為安氏給國貨界之當頭棒喝。</p>
<p>不要忘却農村副業</p>
<p>中國農人十之七八，均以手工品為其一家副業，在機械工業發展之過程中，農村副業，為農民生活之資源，農人生路萬不可忽，果能予以技術之改良，與推銷之助力，亦為國貨之補助，譬如豆漿與牛乳，效用相等，亦未可一味歐化，吐棄豆漿而不顧，須知中國有許多器用上及衣食上之美妙，遠非舶來品所及，是在中國人之善用不忘耳。</p>
<p>誠信服務</p>
<p>安氏曾述美國某成功家以數百元經營事業起家，數十年中積數千萬，其事業遍於全國，叩其所以致此之原因，則為不過「誠信服務，終身弗渝」而已。以誠以信，而又持之儉撲，處之以明敬，守之以恒敬，天下事無往而不利。安氏謂今日以後，茍再待十年二十年，重與諸君一堂談話，則諸君事業均已進展無限，比目下十倍百倍，而均為成功之實業家矣，此非但新年中預祝，茍能放大眼光，緊握機會，以誠信二字為社會服務，以奮鬥二字為事業作戰，事有必至，理所固然。安氏之獎勵工業家，可謂至矣。我工業家宜如何努力進展，打開生路，以不負此旅華三十年之老商務官也？</p>
<h3>國貨誡言</h3>
<p>— 夏中漢</p>
<p>吾國自海通以來，外貨之喧賓奪主，由來已久，而歷年報載入超之鉅，觸目驚心，雖近來提倡國貨之呼聲鎭天價響，但外貨傾銷益較前盛。考國貨不發達之原因，約有二端：</p>
<p>所出貨品不精良，因而不能與外貨媲美；</p>
<p>所出貨品未能儘量宣傳，使人民遍曉。</p>
<p>關於第一點，現今各國貨廠家硏究改進者不少，故對於出品確有始終不懈，精益求精之現象；而獨乏宣傳，爰近有國人自資創設之大衆筆應組織「全國旅行宣傳團，」藉以廣傳，洵足以補提倡國貨之不足。日前至滬南開明中學宣傳，於是國貨自來水筆及墨水大為學生所購用，足見宣傳力之一斑矣。</p>
<p>該廠有「勸用國貨十誡，」可為全國同胞座右箴言，茲特錄之，以供諸君：</p>
<p>你用錢時，切勿忘記謀本國人的利益；</p>
<p>你買外國貨時，切勿忘記你的國家的貧窮；　　　你的金錢，切勿用於增大他國人的富；　　　你買外國貨時，切記本國商人的製造家也正在渴望你去買；</p>
<p>寫本國字，請用本國的墨和筆，寫外國字，也要用本人製造的墨水和筆；</p>
<p>本國的物品，卽使未能盡善盡美，用他的人也是很光榮的；</p>
<p>你要用忍耐，克復本國惡劣的物品；</p>
<p>不要用外國的食物和衣料，玷污你的口腹和身心；</p>
<p>决不要以為用外國貨是光榮的；</p>
<p>惟有國人一律服用國貨，才能使國家富強，人民安樂！</p>
<h3>記江南造紙廠</h3>
<p>— 象賢</p>
<p>說來慚愧，我們日常接觸的報章書籍所用的紙，幾乎沒有不是用着舶來貨的，根據二十二年海關報吿冊，紙的進口總額，為四千三百八十二萬九千元，又二十三年紙的進口總額，為三千七百二十六萬八千元，巨額漏巵，至足驚人，長此以往，何堪設想，國人造紙業當急起直追，實為不容延緩的事啊！</p>
<p>國人造紙業中的廠家，首推天章龍章和江南三廠，不幸天章營業失敗，所存者惟龍章江南一家，獨力和舶來貨競爭，這是我們不可不加以注意的，</p>
<p>江南造紙廠，廠基在本市曹家渡浜北，佔地十八畝，資本為一百萬元，創設迄今，已有十年的歷史，該廠係利用機器造紙，設備極完整，現已裝有一百尺及六十五尺，圓綱楊克式製紙機各有架，十二尺直徑的高壓蒸料球二只，打漿機七架，萊開休鍋爐二只，（供給全廠的蒸汽）一百五十匹馬力的電動馬達一架，大小馬達十六架，其他製紙所必需的機件，均甚齊備，另有大小自流井三座，供給全廠用水，水源方面，有大小濾水池兩處，淸水池數處，水流淸澈可以見底，廠中還設有修理間，專司木工，鐵工，翻砂等工作，可無須依賴他人，廠屋的建築極堅固雅觀，計有廠屋十六座，分辦事室，物料倉庫，原料倉庫，壓鍘間，煮料間，打漿間，動力間等十二部，佈置井然，管理簡易。</p>
<p>該廠出品以製造中國紙為主，目的是硏究利用機器的方法，來改進中國的紙質，出品有江南連史，江南毛邊，海月，重貢，玉扣，仿宋紙等，其次還仿洋紙的製造法，製造適合於鋼筆書寫的連史紙和毛邊紙，這是我國極需要的紙質，關於這一點，該廠的眼光放得很遠的。</p>
<p>江南造紙廠的造紙原料，可說是完全國貨，一切紙的原料，完全用該廠自己發明的蘆漿，（蘆蔁在江浙二省東部及長江一帶產額極夥）不但成本輕微，而且挽回利權不少，至於化學用品，則完全向天原電化廠採購，造紙時所需的膠質，該廠完全採用四川所產物榆木和葵根，這些都是道地的國產。</p>

<h3>貢獻與閩浙贛三省紙商（下）</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>不過木漿是洋行家放帳的，先貨後銀，可以欠上七十五天，不　賣出還錢，而收買竹料，則須先銀後貨，並且先要放本與鄕人定貨，不是熟悉當地的人，難敢去做這門生意，所以我的意思，只有紙行家對山戶去做定貨，抄成了紙料出來，運費就可省去三分之二，而且損失减少，不必三擔做一擔，衹着兩擔半已可，假定料本為二元半，即兩擔半不過六二狗腿子半，原以三擔做一擔，運費核至一元五角，今只五角可矣，兩共不及八元，即每噸不過一百三十四元四角，抄造紙粕的工價，比抄造紙張可省五分之四，姑以每擔紙擔，抄工四角而論，每噸不過六元七角二分，總共不過一百四十元之譜，托由紙廠代造毛邊，每噸可成七十令之譜，即每令之料本，不過二元，對於紙廠應給抄工，每令以一元論，則運工料成本，不過三二（，假定每令紙料一角，每月辦一百噸料，由紙七千令，即有兩萬餘元一月生意可做，賺八九千一年，亦頗穩健，機制紙廠變為打米廠一般，不替米行家打中國米，難道還去買了帶壳的洋米來打不成嗎？所以申新兩報上登着三省紙商家的廣告呼籲，我說是沒用的，除非照我這個計劃，由紙行家來走這一條大路，此外的任何方法宣傳，勸入採用手工紙以救農村，實在是個空談幻想而已。至於放本方面，本來對於槽戶，也是放本的，現在改為紙柏，出數可增五倍，而出紙迅速，周轉自易，只要趁早在小滿節前的一二個月，下個决心去走這條出路，一年之計在於春，光陰是不可錯過的，如果能彀實行，那就一年之中，可以挽回了四千萬元的紙額入超呢。譬如在圍城之中，只要有人奮勇當先，殺出一條生路，自然有人趕緊跟隨，不用去邀請他，也不用去苦勸他，凡是要圖生存的人們，當然會得同向生路上走，决不會待坐以待斃。三省紙商，都大世守其業，子子孫孫，賴着上人之福，亨着現成天下，現在處到這種危亡的時候，不為一般失業的人羣計，難道也不為子孫計嗎？放着現成走熟的路不走，另想找尋別路，與人爭奪地盤，則不如反守為攻，來得容易些呢。</p>

<h3>陜西服用　國貨團主席馮慧貞女士訪問記</h3>
<p>— 天然</p>
<p>團員三萬五千一致宣誓　不用國貨即非賢妻良母　婦女提倡國貨效力最大</p>
<p>一天的上午，訪問陜西服用國貨團主席馮慧貞女士於旅舍。馮女士係西安中國國貨公司董事張雲卿君之夫人，年事約三十許，品齒清晰，儀態大方，雖屬常州人，頗善國語。馮女士謂雖屬內地，惟近年以來，人民習尚日見奢侈，舶來品之侵入，年有增加，尤以婦女界為甚。西安同志，引為深憂，因此聯合地方長官及各界領袖之伉儷，共同發起此服用國貨團，邵主席及各廳長之夫人，均為本會執監委員，熱心贊助，半年之中，加入本團者，已有三萬五千餘人，每人入團之時，須親寫誓約書，立誓不用外貨。並由國中給予購用國貨證，凡至國貨公司或商號購買國貨者，得享有優待之權利，以故大家閨秀，學校靑年，以及工商界人士，均踴躍參加，其以杜團員進展之速，為任所公團所不及。凡集合同志十人，卽可成立一個分團，報吿總團，卽予注冊，編寫次序，一槪不收費用，以杜流弊。本人深以提倡國貨與服用國貨，以女子之責任甚大，故不解勞苦，從事鼓吹與勸導，務使西安各界人人服用國貨為天職，以後穿着飲食及辦理喜事，茍非採用國貨，大家認為莫大之恥辱。人人以服用國貨為榮，茍家庭主婦，不以服用國貨為職志，卽失其賢妻良母之資格。陜西共有九十二縣，現擬從西安做起，逐漸推廣至內地各縣，務使服用國貨之宏願，普徧於全陝。本人認為提倡國貨，以婦女之鼓動，效力最大。希望上海婦女界，亦起而為同樣之組織，以作內地之倡導。目下提倡國貨，應注意內地工作，蓋全國人口中，以內地農人占多數，故希望提倡國貨之同志，從內地方面多下工夫，本人願隨全國熱心士女之後，力盡棉薄，俾入超兩字不復存於中國人之心目中，我國產業或有復興之一日云，馮女士為南京女子師範畢業，曾任蘇州嘉定各女學敎師，與張君婦倡夫隨，不失為一對提倡國貨之賢伉儷也。</p>

<p>電信特栞</p>
<h3>國家統一與電信統一</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>蔣委員長元旦吿國人演辭，由南京中央廣播電台播送，全國各地，無論窮鄉僻壤，凡裝有適當之收音機者，均能收聽，足見廣播事業之功用，實為促進政治之利器。歐美國家領袖，每有定大計决大疑必須宣示於民眾時，靡不登台講演，藉廣播電信之能力，傳達於全國民眾，得其同情，獲其諒解，而成舉國一致之行動。用是精誠團結，共赴國難，良有以也。</p>
<p>雖然，廣播事業，誠有助於國家統一，惟須促成整個電信事業之統一，則廣播事業，始能發達。蓋廣播不過電信事業之一部份，敬整個事業不能統一，則廣播决不能單獨發展。因為廣播無綫電收音機，必須經電政機關登記後，始能裝設。若該項機關，非中央權力所及，不予發給登記證，不許登記，即登記或限制其內容機件，雖有中央廣播電波，亦無法收聽。故電信主權，為國家行政權之一，敬該項主權，有所破壞，即國家行政權，被其破壞，國家統一云乎哉？</p>
<p>我國自十七年北伐完成，國家已吿統一，然以種種關係，中央行政權，未能行使全國。去年剿匪軍事吿成，川黔滇等省政治，已趨正軌，兩廣黨政領袖，更於去年十一月連袂入京，參加五全大會。兩廣電政機關，亦日與中央主管機關接近，至平津等電局，久為中央直轄，更無論矣。故在國家方面言之，以政治力量，促成國家統一；在電信方面言之，以國家力量，鞏固電信統一。此種現象，實為現代國家所應有，而為全國民眾深切禱盼者也。</p>
<p>是故電信主權，不可分裂，亦不可讓予，與土地人民同為國家構成條件之一，若經分裂或讓予，則國家神經系統被其破壞，一切軍事交通政治文化各方面，均將受其影響。謀國之士，豈可忽乎？</p>
<h3>談談編譯電報密碼的方法</h3>
<p>— 淸華</p>
<p>編製電報密碼的目的有兩個，有個是保守秘密，一個是節省報費。黨政軍機關及私人所發的密碼電報，目的在保守電文內容的秘密，所以大都用華文密碼，就是用四個數碼組成的密碼，每一密碼代替一個字，除官軍密碼電報特准與明碼價目相同外，其餘等尋常加急等密碼電報，要照普通明碼價目加倍收費，所以在報費方面很不經濟。商行所發的密碼電報，目的在節省報費，所以大都利用洋文密碼，就是用五個洋文字母組成的密碼，每一密碼可以代替一句或幾個字，不但報費可以節省數倍。同時也可保守電文內容的秘密，可稱一舉兩得的了！</p>
<p>這裏先來談談編製華文密碼的方法：編製華文密碼的方法很容易，只要向電報局買一本明密電碼新編，該編電碼部份上端和旁邊各印有十個空格。上端十個空格稱為橫行空格，旁邊十個空格稱為直行空格。橫直兩行空格內，每格應塡寫一個數碼，十個空格內所塡的數碼不可相同，不過先後次序不妨顛倒，例如4937502816。這兩行密碼塡妥後，再在書角上每頁塡寫兩個數碼，如25，47，之類，（簡稱角碼）不過各頁所塡的數碼，不能相同，次序則先後不拘，要是貪省便，那末順序編寫，也無不可。照上面所說的塡妥後，一本密碼本就算成功，只要再在那本電碼新編書面上，定一個密碼的名稱，如國密，民密之類，再加註一句「先直後橫」或「先橫後直」，就完成了。</p>
<p>發出的電報要譯成密碼時，先找到某字的所在地位，把那頁角上的兩個數碼作為千位和百位電碼（假定該兩數碼為25），再看上端橫行空格內對着該字的一個數碼，作為十位電碼（假定為9），再看直行空格內對着該字的一個數碼，作為單位電碼（假定為8），那字的密碼就是2589。這個方式稱為「先橫後直」式，因為橫行格內的數碼在先，直行格內的數碼在後。反之，如該密碼變為2598，那就是「先直後橫」式。</p>
<p>翻譯收到的密電，比較譯去電煩難些，因為大多數的密本，對於每頁角上所寫的兩碼，並非挨次順利，例如第一頁上寫32兩碼，第二頁上寫74兩碼，這樣先後顛倒，要知道某一密碼究竟在那一頁上，是很麻煩的事，所以交通部的電碼新編裏，特別附加一張「明密碼對照索引表」，在這張表上，把原來每頁的明碼首兩碼與角上編寫的兩個密碼預先對照塡上，在翻譯來電時，只須查閱此表，就知某一密碼在那一頁上，可以節省許多的時間。</p>
<p>上面所說的編製密碼的方法，是一個最簡便普通的方法。我們常聽見有人說，某人有推知密碼的特別本領，某人對於任何密碼，都能想法譯出來，其實那些人充其極不過能將最普通編製的密碼，推算出來，因為以前大家編密碼，不很考究，例如每頁的橫直兩行密碼，都編得一樣，角上所編的兩個密碼，都是順序編列，例如第一頁編寫25，第二頁就編26，並且用普通書局印售的碼本，於是一班熟悉電碼的內家，就將電文起首和末尾常用的字，逐一推測，只要推出幾個常用的字，就會把橫直行密碼和角碼推算出來，要是把每頁橫直行密碼都編的不同，角碼又先後顛倒並不順序，那麽縱是電碼專家也副手無策的了。</p>
<h3>電話租費及保證金繳納辦法之改進</h3>
<p>— 麟</p>
<p>電話原為便利通信之設備，故其目的在謀如何使應用者得獲最高之便利，所謂最高之便利者，有二涵義：其一，卽在技術上予用戶以最良之服務；其二，卽在費用上予用戶以最輕之「負擔。近年來交通部對於電話事業，力求刷新整頓，不遺餘力，亦卽本此兩項原則進行，就前者之例證而言，如綫路之勘修，機件之整理，新式設備之運用等等，凡使用電話者，類能指出今日之電話，較諸　昔已有長足之進步；再就後者之例證而言，現在交部所轄各話局對於電話月租，裝機，撤機等費，泰半無已减低，而保證金一項原來須預存六七十元者，目前均已减至二三十元，最多亦不過五十元，又如裝有正機曁分機者僅須將正機一項之保證金繳納，凡此種種，無不予用戶以負擔之减輕，而增加使用之便利。</p>
<p>但一般用戶仍感稍有困難者，卽為保證金之繳納問題。保證金之意義，原為保證月租費之支付，機件損壞之賠償等等，自係事實上之所必要，惟因用戶裝置電話之際，旣須支出裝費，用時又須繳納保證金，値此經濟衰落之年，一時必須悉數繳齊，難免不有困難，以是常有若干需用電話者，因此之故而致躊躇裝設，此種情形，不特影響電話業務本身之發展，亦且未盡民眾使用便利之旨。最近交通部有鑒於此，為貫澈最高便利之目的起見，特訂定用戶分期繳納保證金及預繳租費辦法一種，規定用戶裝設電話設備應預存之保證金，得於一年內分期繳納，庶使用戶得有一通融辦法，不必定須一時繳足，但另徵以輕微之手續費，在半年以內分期繳淸者，加收百分之五，在一年以內分期繳淸者，加收百分之十，以示限制。</p>
<p>同時，亦有若干用戶為求省事起見，往往預存租費一季或竟至一年者，此種預繳之租費，雖係出諸用戶為求省事之自動，但在市塲上例有應得之息金，交通部對於此種用戶，為示優待起見，特於前項辦法中，規定用戶預繳租費者，得將租費略予减低，以期公允。其减低數目，規定如下：　預繳一季者，减低百分之一；　預繳二季者减低百分之二；　預繳三季者减低百分之三；　預繳一年者，减低百分之四。</p>
<p>此項辦法，在一方面對於一時無力繳足保證金者，予以通融之便利，而同時在另一方面，對於預繳租費者，亦不忽視其利益，法良意美，亦近年來電政上之一莫大改進也。</p>
<h3>長途電話發話須知</h3>
<p>— 靑</p>
<p>凡已裝有市內電話者，祗須向話局預繳長途電話保證金，或向話局聲請長途電話登記，（辦法視各地情形而異，但保險金在停發長途電話時，仍可發還。）便可在自己所裝的話機上發長途電話。發話時，先須接呌電話局的長途召，接通之後，再報明要什麽地方，受話人有無電話，抑或須派人傳呼，再說明收話人的電話號碼，或姓名住址。話局接綫生便將上述各項一一記錄下來，這一種手續，呌做「掛號」。</p>
<p>接綫生記錄完畢後，如果長途綫正有人講話，或是在某一掛號之先，已經有好幾戶掛號，那麽發話人就得放下聽筒，靜等一會，等輪到了時，接綫生自會通知的。所以掛號之後，常須等待好些時間，但不明這種原故的發話人常會因此發生誤會，以為接綫生工作懈怠，不肯趕快接綫，這種催促與質問都因厄於事實，難以生效的。倘是發話人眞有迫不及待地欲圖快速，祗可加倍付費，改打加急電話，那麽便可以提前通話了。但是如果同時有幾個加急電話時，則後呌的仍須等待片刻的。總之，電話局接長途電話，是以掛號先後與通話的種類挨着次序接通絕不會有意延擱。</p>
<p>上面是已裝有市內電話者的發長途電話的手續。其未裝市內電話，或雖裝有電話而未向話局聲請長途電話登記手續者，欲打發長途電話時祗須到電話局電報局或各電報收發處內所設的長途電話零售處發在那里有人會吿訴你怎樣打法的。長途電話每次通話的時間，規定為三分鐘，過三分鐘時，卽作兩次計算，至多不得接連三次。通話時間由電局或零售處職員在旁記錄，滿三分鐘時，便會通知停話。如其發話人的說話尚未終了，卽向接綫生聲明要連續一次。至於繳付長途話費，凡已繳保證金或已登記者，由電局於每月月終總結後通知用戶照付。其零時發話者均須隨打隨付，由電局或零售處　給收據，發話人於收下收據時，應騐明所付的費是否與收據所開的數目相符？在那里，並貼着各處長途電話通話價目表，以備查看。</p>
<p>發長途電話手續，已略加上述。現在再把長途通話的各類及性質寫在后面：</p>
<p>普通通話　按照發話人掛號之先後，挨次接通。此種通話，往往不能立刻接通，因為常有許多掛號已在先早掛了，所以不免要等候片刻，但其價目最為低廉。</p>
<p>加急通話　如因特別要事，欲與對方立卽通話時，則此種通話最為合式，因為可以提在普通通話之前接通的。打時祗須聲明要加急通話，便可照辦，話費照普通通話加倍收取。</p>
<p>傳呼通知　如果通話的地方，尚未設有市內電話，或雖有市內電話而所要的受話人並未裝置電話，那麽就得由電局派人去傳呼受話人到電局來接話，這就呌做傳呼通知，照普通或加急通話收費之外，尚須另收　力費。此種　力費在五公里以內者槪收一角，一公里以外者，暫不傳呼。倘按照發話人所說的地址錯誤，以致無從傳呼，或派人通知後，對方不肯接話時，除所收　力費槪不退還外，並須收取普通話三分之一的話費，作為銷號費。如發話掛了號，臨時請求銷號的，亦同樣辦理。</p>
<p>預告通知　倘發話人欲與指定的人通話，（就是非這個人不可的）就得打預吿通知電話。其性質與傳呼通知相似，不過指定必須某一個人而已。其話費照普通話費收費外，再須加收普通話費的三分之一。</p>
<p>以上各種通話，如於已經掛號後，因機件或電綫臨時發生障礙，致發話人不能通話者，則已繳之各項費用，均完全退還。又　力費預吿通知費，不論加急通話或是普通通話，均按普通價目徵收，並無加倍的規定。</p>
<h3>交通部取締民營電話事業之意義</h3>
<p>— 驊</p>
<p>盼各商辦電話公司迅速呈請立案</p>
<p>電話交通，為公用事業之一種，其辦理之良　，直接影響公眾之福利，故國民政府公佈之民營公用事業監督條例，明定民營電話應歸中央主管機關之監督，藉以防止私人企業之操縱，並統制電話工程及業務合於規定之標準，而使公眾獲得滿意之服務。顧近年以來，國內商電話公司雖呈准註冊者，似仍不在少數，交部為統制國內電信事業起見，自不容關係國家交通之電話，任令私人經營而不受政府之監督，其針有嚴厲之處置，自為必然之結果，記者爰願乘此時會，揭　數義，為吾商辦電話公司曁關心電信事業者吿。</p>
<p>查電話綫路之架設，機械之裝置，以及電力之供給等等，隨在均與技術問題相關，决非不學無術者所可草率從事必須專家之設計指導，俾合乎規定之標準，而後電話之通暢可期。交部對於各民營電話公司，先經派員查勘，確認為工程上並無不合後，始行核准立案，是故凡呈准立案之民營電話公司，其技術工程上不　已得可靠之保障，此其一。</p>
<p>按照民營公用事業監督條例第十三條規定：「民營公用事業，如其性質在同一區域內不適於並營者，非認原有營業之設備力確已不能再行擴充至足供公用之需要時，於同一營業區域內，不得有同種第二公用事業之設立，」依此解釋，則商辦電話公司經交部核准立案後，敬非本身設備不能再行擴充至足供公共之需要時，其營業可得專利之保障，此其二。</p>
<p>夫近代電話事業之趨勢，為長距離通信，擴展我國為適應潮流起見，近亦有人省長途電話之建設，蓋市內電話之運用，祗限於一隅之通話。欲求營業之發展，自非連接長途話綫與其他都市通話不可。交部為擴充國內電話通信，近方積極推行與各商辦市內電話公司簽訂接綫通話合同。凡已經註冊立案之商辦電話公司，自皆得享受此項擴展營業之權利，此其三。</p>
<p>由此觀之，交部監督民營電話事業之目的，純係積極的扶持，絕非消極的取締。凡未經立案之商辦電話公司，亟應明瞭此項意義，迅速呈請立案，以免喪失上述之權利。</p>
<p>抑吾人尤有進者。電話事業為民眾通信之工具，亦為傳遞情報之利器，故其關係影響於國家人民利益者甚大，按照民營公司事業監督條例第九條規定：「民營公用事業，其全年純利，達到實收資本總額百分之二十五時，其次年應减少收費或擴充設備」，又第十一條規定「民營公用事業不得加入外股或抵借外債」，然則關心電信事業者對於未經立案各民營電話公司，亟應本政府與人民合作之義，儘量檢舉，以盡國民之天職也。</p>
<h3>試評交通部招考無綫電報務員辦法</h3>
<p>— 松</p>
<p>交通部為公開招取無綫電報務人員起見，特制定招考無綫電報務員暫行辦法。於去年十一月二十日公布，通飭各局於需用無綫電報務人員時，遵照辦理。該項辦法之優點如下：</p>
<p>推行考試制度　夫政治之淸明，必須登庸人才，而人才之進退，莫貴乎考試。此總理所以規定考試權為五權憲法之一也。年來各項人員考試規則，多經考試院制定，惟我無綫電報人員欲貢獻能力時，大都隨時自請投效，雖經局中考試，而考試辦法並無一定標準與範圍，究尚未臻完善，茲經制定招考辦法，殊有助於考試制度之推行也。</p>
<p>投考機會均等　前日旣無考試辦法，凡志願投考而不明呈請手續者，深苦欲入無門，機會殊為不均。茲查該項辦法第一：「交通部所屬各電局及電台遇有無綫電報務員缺額時，由部指定局台登報招考錄用，」第二條「凡有志投考者，應於局台登報招考時，報名應考，其隨時呈部投效者，槪置不理。」將投效途徑，完全塞閉，則士無被棄之慮，人無倖進之心。此外關於考試事宜，組織考試委員會辦理之。凡具有無綫電報務員之常識與技能者，不患無出路也。</p>
<p>提高取錄程度　關於投考資格之標準，該項辦法第三條第三項「高中學業或交通審查合格之無綫電傳習所畢業有證件足資證明者」規定之。關於常識之標準，第四條「考試科目分　黨義，　國文，　英文，　電學，　電報法規等項」規定之。關於技術之標準，第五條「　收報及發報每分鐘華文四碼二十字洋文，五碼十六字，　收發報兩項錯誤總計不得超過百分之五」規定之。凡被錄取者，至少必須達到上項標準，則程度齊一，通信效率增加矣。</p>
<p>上項三者，均係該項辦法之優點。凡有投考無綫電報務員者。必須具有該項辦法所規定之學識始能取錄。欲具有投考之學識，必須入學交通部審查合格之無綫電傳習所，始能獲得，此學其所用，用盡其才之道也。</p>
<h3>華文電報內括弧符號之書寫格式及計費辦法</h3>
<p>— 仲賢</p>
<p>括弧符號在華文電報內用途甚廣。茲就吾人所常見之實例列舉如次：　用於書寫收報人住址內之門牌號數者，例如「南京中山北路（1105）號」，　用於書寫代替收報人住址之郵箱號數者，例如「上海郵箱（275）荘文華」；　用於書寫代替收報人住址之電話號碼者，例如「上海話租（22108）張伯舜」；　用於書寫電文內之阿拉伯數目字者，例如「速電匯（2500）元濟急」；　用於書寫明語銀行及錢業電報內之密碼對號字及表示發電日期及號數之阿拉伯數目字者，例如「（3518）（1601）號交恒豐荘伍萬元」；　用於書寫電文內阿拉伯數目字組成之商務標識者，例如「（814）牌海昌布貨缺速運」；　用於書寫電文內雜用之少數洋文字者，例如「欵已匯（321000　Voltsdynamotor）待用急火速運京」；　用於書寫住址稱謂雜用之少數洋文字者，例如「上海仁記路沙遜大厦內（RCA　Communications　Mr.　Shecken）；　用於書寫電文內數個相連之成組電碼者，例如「電悉逃夥李良（一名桂生）如來平卽扣留」；　用於書寫洋文商務標識者，例如（ghf　45）（15BS）（D3）等。上述各種書寫格式均為各大都會一般發報人所習用，可見括弧符號在華文電報內之用途頗為繁要也。</p>
<p>上項括弧符號，在華文電報內，究竟應否免費或計費？現行國內電報營業通則內，均已分別規定。　屬於免費者，可分為甲·乙·丙·三種：甲·華文明密碼電報收報人住址內之門牌號數，郵箱號數，電話號碼等所用括弧符號。乙·華文明語或密語電報電文內之阿拉伯數目字或阿拉伯數目字組成之商標識所用括弧符號。丙·華文明語銀行或錢業電報內之密碼對號字及表示發電日期號數之阿拉伯數目字每字前後所用括弧符號。　屬於計費者，亦可分為甲·乙·丙·三種：甲·華文明語或密語電報收報人住址或電文內雜用少數洋文字前後之括弧符號。乙·數個相連成組電碼前後所用括弧符號。丙·洋文商務標識前後之括弧符號。上項括弧符號應分別按照原電所屬報類及電文種類應收之價目核收一字報費。例如以上書寫格式舉例第七至第十各例假定為華文明語尋常電報，所有括弧符號均按華文明語尋常電價目計費，卽每一括弧符號（）收費一角。但此項括弧符號如用於華文密語電報內，則應按華文密語價目二角計費。</p>
<p>近來各電局與發報人之間，對於華文電報內所用括弧符號之應否免費或計費？往往發生爭執。如因此區區一二字報費而竟引起誤會，殊於電局業務前途攸關。爰將關於括弧符號之書寫格式及應否免費或計費詳細舉例說明，俾各界對於電局定章，可以詳悉　遺，亦本刋對於公眾應盡之使命也。</p>

<h3>交際年的今昔</h3>
<p>— 夏治</p>
<p>新世紀的人們最講究「交際」的形式和手段隨着進展而變更，在新世紀的環境中，「交際」幾乎成為人類生活中主要的一部分了。從個人與個人之間。團體與團體之間。家庭與家庭之間，以至國家和國家之間，都不能一日或離交際。從表面看來，所謂交際上酬應，不過一種普通的友誼的聯誼；但實際上呢，「交際所關係的不僅是一點友誼上的感情作用，簡直可以影響人們的整個生活哩。</p>
<p>最普遍的一種交際，要算是賀年吧？每逢新年，近處的人互相拜訪，見面拱手，彼此說一句恭喜：遠一點的專誠寫信道賀，就忙了郵差，無限的情意，都等他一家一家傳遞。後來改賀年帖，用一張紅紙印的名帖，不久改成買印就的賀年片，加上自己的名字；又有不買現成的賀年片的方式逐漸完善，在手續上也越改越便利。但是，時代不絕地進展着，到現在，郵遞賀年名片已經是落伍的賀年方式了，試看每到元旦左右幾天，每個人要收到一大堆從遠近各方寄來的賀年片，誰肯細細的檢察一番，那一張是那個人寄來的呢？卽使看了以後，也不會留什麽印象，好像這不過是普通的敷衍文章，不値得注意的。至於友誼之不足以因此增進，自是可想可知了！</p>
<p>那麽，代替這種賀年名片而周旋於時髦的交際社會中的是什麽呢？不用說，那是賀年交際電報了。一聽「電報」這兩個字，立刻給一個「快」的聯想，不錯，這二十世紀的末頁是個崇尚「速率」的時代。嫌火車走得慢，發明用飛機。社會上的一切是一致地向着「快」發展的，所以「快」是最能給人刺激一說到賀年，那末用電報，就最適合這一個要求。賀年原是「老調」，不容易引起人人的注意，但是加上了「快」，就全然不同了。假使你新年中收到幾封彩色信封的賀年交賀電報，你就準會好奇地非拆開來念一遍不可，那末打這電報給你賀年的人底名字，也就會深深地印到你的腦中。這不僅是「新奇」的作用，因為「電報」兩個字根本就有一種刺激性存，這種刺激性也帮着把你鼓動了。</p>
<p>一個現代人的交際手腕如何，是直接間接都可以影響到他整個生活問題的，所以聰明的現代人是不肯放棄有效力的交際工具的。交際電報，就是這種工具的最好一種，你的朋友親戚，有下列事故時，（甲）慶賀年節，結婚，添嗣，壽誕，紀念，升學，畢業，出洋，開張，遷居，考取，升遷，就職，發明，成功，勝利，典禮，得獎，（乙）弔唁喪之，殖葬，（丙）慰問疾病，災荒，失愼，受傷，被盜，失敗等等，用幾角錢拍一張交際電報，其效力抵得普通信十倍以上谷話說：「平時不燒香，急時抱佛腳」。燒香的辦法，莫如交際電報的利用。</p>
<h3>電話彈詞</h3>
<p>— 葉林生</p>
<p>棹上忽聽響鈴鈴，道是吾家電話聲，取下聽筒相答語，居然隔面可　心。電話是，自從美國發明後，倍爾聲名傳到今，全球到處盡歡迎。</p>
<p>一機裝來眞利便：現在打得到、國內省縣與鄉村、將來打得到，國外倫敦，巴黎，柏林，紐約與東京。試將利益從頭說，可算得，件件舒齊樣樣眞。有的是，喜慶婚喪憑寄語，有的是，靠牠一綫話私情，有的是，交遊廣闊奔波苦，不妨借此互談心，有的是，生意經營資萬貫，撥機一語定行情。還有那，消遣欲臨娛樂所，就可以請牠傳語定房聽。還有那，深宵歸晚門關閉，就可以，請牠招呼夢裏人。還有那，無端暴客來光顧，不難請他鐵鎖　鐺入獄門。似這樣功用多端難盡述，所以是，城鄉各處盡風行。</p>
<p>况且押費不多機件新，新章裝費也暫停，接綫人，迅速兼和氣，請字連連說幾聲。還有那長途電話市鄉接，可以四通八達何止上海與南京。費又省，話又淸，並非虛譽久傳名，盡　電話個個靈。勸諸位，試裝話機且看看，便信我言句句眞。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>錫滬公路試行木炭汽車</h3>
<p>— 建屏</p>
<p>十三日本報載：錫滬公路試騐仲明工廠所木炭汽車，自滬至常，載客甚多，車行頗速，自始至終均在三十二馬至三十八馬之間，最高至四十二馬。消耗木炭四十餘市斤，合約一元左右，僅及汽油三分之一。該路决將全部六十輛汽車，改燃木炭。按仲明式木炭汽車，一二年來，在各省公路試行成功的消息，本報迭有記載，這次錫滬公路的試騐，可說又一有力的證實，其意義不僅是發明人湯仲明的個人成功，同時也是國民經濟衰退中的一綫曙光。</p>
<p>法國的老虎總理克來孟索在歐洲大戰時曾說：「一滴煤油，和一滴血同樣的可貴。」近年以來，國際間的爭執，也都以煤油問題為其重心。如日俄北庫頁島煤油的開採，和阿比西尼亞油礦讓與的問題，固然是最好的例證，這次國聯對竟制裁，重慶的步驟，也集中於禁油問題，這可見煤油問題，不僅是一個經濟問題，早成為國防的要素了。</p>
<p>汽油是煤油的同素異性體了，是煤油在攝氏一百五十度以上蒸發出來的，所以也呌揮發油，是今日交通工具汽車和飛機等的重要發動力。許多國家，為了國內不產汽油，竭力研究汽油代用品問題，如酒精，卽一度被認為汽油的代用品，但在經濟上沒有立足的可能，因此今日各國所研究的，大都集中於木炭，而且都有相當的成功。如日本鈴木勝利氏及其弟嘉明氏，最近將其研究成功的木炭汽車，送往陸軍省，得有特許專利的憑證。意相墨索里尼，為抵制國聯經濟封鎖，特徵集國內有名技術員，取我國木炭代油方法，已獲得進一步的成功，曾以木炭代油車，作國際訪問式的行駛，經奧國匈牙利波蘭德國比利時荷蘭等八國的都城而回羅馬。此外如法國德國瑞士芬蘭瑞典捷克匈牙利等國，都試用一種木屑代油汽車（Gasogene），而且數量日見增加，這種所謂木屑代油汽車，也就是木炭汽車。</p>
<p>我國每年汽油消耗，約在四千萬元以上，自國民經濟言，誠為一個重大漏巵；自國防言，更是一個嚴重問題；退而從公路言，也是發展上一個極大的阻碍。汽油代用品問題，比了其他各國，尤為嚴重；然而因為國家連年多故，政府旣未還顧及，一般企業家也沒有深切的注意。如湯仲明發明木炭汽車，尚在三四年前，較日本意國等還早，而且墨索里尼還派員來研究，在國際上早引起重視，而在國內的為人注意，却還是一年以來的事，這不能不使人引為遺憾。現在國際危機，日益急迫，汽油來源，旣在在可慮；國民經濟，日見崩潰，鉅大漏巵，也不能常此不塞；至於發展公路事業的唯一條件，也只有减低汽車的消費。木炭代油，從前固然有人懷疑，現在各國都已採用，我國湯仲明君亦研究成功，經多次的試騐，尤其這一次錫滬公路的試騐，證明在速率上不遜汽油汽車，經濟上已大見减省，倘能全國一致採用，再加改進，則國防上，國民經濟上，發展公路事業上種種難題，都可迎刃而解。我們希望政府當局與國內企業家，用全力來提倡！</p>
<h3>爸爸回來了</h3>
<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>冬天的日子特別短暫，晚飯後，從局里回家來，天上已是一片漆黑了。</p>
<p>街上年關大拍賣的布標，在晚風里飄蕩着，綢緞店里那些臨時僱來的吹打手，正奏着一些娓娓的滸歌曲，把路人的耳朶都震聾了。我默默地走着，覺得第個行人的臉都是緊繃繃的，連步伐似乎亦特別來得急促。「過三天就是大年夜了。」我默默地想着，心頭給「年關」壓得喘不過氣來。</p>
<p>轉入胡同里，守在家門口的弟弟立刻就飛跑過來，拉着我的衣裙，似乎想把我拉下身子來，聽聽他的耳語一樣，他用一種低低的聲音說：</p>
<p>「爸爸回來了！」弟弟臉上的神氣是驚詫而緊張。</p>
<p>「爸爸回來了？」我不信任地這樣自語着，「爸爸眞的回來了嗎？」</p>
<p>「下午三點鐘回來的，現在在家里喝酒哩！」弟弟說。</p>
<p>立刻，父親糢糊的印象又出現在我的眼前了。約莫在七年前，父親曾隨着一位遠房的親眷到湖北去，聽說在一個專管菸稅的衙門里當差。每年一到臘月，母親總呌我執筆，請父親回家休息些時，但父親總以路途太遠，回家的路費要化一大筆錢這理由推延下去。近一二年來，父親的信越來越稀了，連帶着錢亦越寄越少了。母親曾為這事哭昏了好幾回，連我亦輟學到一個小機關里去當個錄事。現在父親竟像給風吹來一般，飄回家里來了。</p>
<p>「這事情似乎凶多吉少呢，為什麽父親事前不來一信通知呢？」我踏入家門的時候，心里就這樣想着。堂廳里的洋油燈在陰暗射出橙黃色的光彩。一位年老的人家坐在桌傍，看見我進來，便把端在手里的小酒杯放下去，用着糢糊的神色打量着我。</p>
<p>「爸爸！」我小聲地呌着，心里猛然感到說不出的難過，眼淚撲簌簌地掉了下來。</p>
<p>糢糊里，我看見父親對我點了點頭，一面端上小酒杯呷了一口酒。</p>
<p>在我心里，本來有說不淸多少的話語想湧出來，可是，這冰冷的光景却像一塊大石頭，把它死命的壓將下去了。我用眼角打量着父親，他的髪鬢已經灰白了，嘴沿上長着兩把枯草樣的鬍鬃。布面在燈光下顯得分外油滑。脚下那對布鞋滿積着黃土，黑色的鞋面前一半已變成黃色了。</p>
<p>「局里忙不忙？」父親終於打破了僵局，用沙啞的聲音問。</p>
<p>「忙得很，這幾天」我說。</p>
<p>「往後你要刻苦些兒，我現在已閑下來了。」爸的聲音小得聽不淸。</p>
<p>「是…是…」我不曉得怎樣回答才好，兩顆黃豆一樣的淚珠從頰上滴下來。</p>
<p>「你年紀亦不小了，多見些世面，多吃點苦頭，就多得點見識。別像我，唉：」父親長長地吧了一口氣。一對粗糙的手掌抱住他的頭，那長滿着灰色頭髪的頭顱亦不住着搖動着。</p>
<p>我呆呆地站着，眼睛注視着地面，心想找出關句話來安慰這奔跑了半生，而結果終於潦倒到這樣子的父親，可是</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>我的心已麻痺了。</p>
<p>就在這時候，堂屋後面傳來了母親粗厲的聲音：『嘿！你再說，再說，我就撕裂你這張小嘴巴！你爸閒下來了，到那里找一些閒錢給我買這玩藝，我勸你好好聽娘的話，要不，小心吃鞭子！</p>
<p>『你亦不小了，』母親的聲音轉得柔和些了。『開年讓你爸把你送到一家店子里當學徒去，人家像你這年紀，就在外面吃飯了。哼！』</p>
<p>堂屋裏静得像冬夜的郊野。父親呆呆地坐在那兒，端着酒杯的左手一動亦不動了，正出神地望着廳外，那里，天是一片漆黑。</p>
<p>我呆呆地站着，眼前是漸漸糢糊起來了。</p>
<h3>倔强的孩子</h3>
<p>— 胡慰雄</p>
<p>有一個冬天，父親派我到羊角鎭店裏去結賬：在我要離開那鎭的前兩天，忽然降着很大的雪，幾天之内似乎不能開陽的樣子。河道也冰斷了，小汽油船的售票處懸着『河道冰凍，暫停行駛』的牌子；趕畜口的蕭老頭整天宿在長發酒店裏嚼蠶荳兒灌酒。有人喚他畜口，他結着舌頭回答：『年底了，這頭驢子也該休息幾天，客官，明年開路吧。』打着哈哈，自顧灌他的黃湯。</p>
<p>我們店裏採辦貨物總是僱他的畜口，因爲旱道較水道要短三分之一的路程。這次我們伙計去喚他的時候，他打跌着到店裏來，見了我很親熱地拍着我的肩頭說：『小老板，開春動身罷。這末大的雪天，不要說畜口没有勁，咱蕭老頭年紀也大了，趕不上路！小老板，帶着銀子走路，也是危險的啊！』</p>
<p>於是我打定主意，預備在羊角鎭過年了。</p>
<p>羊角鎭在泰縣的岔道上，有幾百戶人家，大街上亦有綢緞店和藥材舖，居民以耕種爲多。我每年到鎭上一次，在鎭上過年卻是第一次，每天吃過午飯，獃在店裏没有事做——在過年的前幾天，本來是店裏最閑散的日子，那些伙計們，碍着我小老板的耳目，都不好意思打??牌，或是到小巷裏去溜一遭，於是我總獨自踱出店來，從鎭西到鎭東逛逛，有時也到長發店裏和蕭老頭把盃，到落黑回店吃飯。新春三天，店舖都關起門來，各商店的伙計們互相往來聚賭，我們店裏的伙計雖也有這個意思邀我加入，但爲了父親定的店規，我不能這樣做，一邊又恐掃了他們的興頭，在新春三天裏没有玩個暢快，還是在飯後踱出門來。街上旣是静悄悄没見一個行人，於是我想跑得遠一點，看看羊角鎭的四周是個什麽景象。那天走到小汽船的輪埠頭，因爲可灘冰凍了，有許多人用着木棒鐵鎚敲冰汲水。蕭老頭不知是否灌飽了黃湯，也捋着衣袖混在人堆裏，一邊嘴裏哼着不成樣調子，滿高興地敲着冰。他們没有一個人注意到我。</p>
<p>在人羣里有一個十三四嵗的孩子，獨自坐在石級上泣哭。他穿着一件很單薄的衣服，打顫着身子，彷彿坐不住的樣子。蕭老頭忽然呌了起來？『金狗子來呵，這樣冷的天，眼淚要結冰的！』他回過頭見我立在岸上，馬上跳起來，像一個孩子似的：『小老板，做做好事吧，這孩子没有穿，没有吃，到店里賞一碗给他罷。』</p>
<p>這樣，敲冰的人都圍了上來。他們告訴我：金狗子是這里打鐵鋪里的學徒，老板和蕭老頭同樣是個酒糊塗，每天没有二百文麥燒，上門的顧客他都要得罪的，冲出嘴來就是駡人，彷彿也没有酒喝是什麽人害了他的。老闆娘是個名聞羊角鎭的潑婦，但是她會做生意，丈夫得罪了顧客，她能打着笑臉賠禮，甚至東掏西摸向主顧賈俏。於是潑婦的名反不及她的淫蕩出色了。學徒金狗子生就倔强脾氣，他會看不過老闆娘的做生意手腕，到處說壞話；老闆没有酒吃的時候，他常用不好聽的話來諷刺他。老闆娘因此不給他衣服穿，不許他吃飯，店里不論大小工作，都推到金狗子身上……</p>
<p>我驚奇這孩子的倔强脾氣，帶他到店來。但是當伙計們請他吃飯的時候，他搖搖頭預備拔脚走了。蕭老頭提小鷄似的把他抓住了，駡畜口一樣地駡着他：『看你到什麽地方去吃飯，發脾氣也要看看主人面的，人家好意請你吃飯呵！』</p>
<p>『我不要吃！』金狗子很乾脆地回答：『老闆娘不許我吃飯！』</p>
<p>『小老闆請你吃飯，老闆娘不會知道的，咱蕭老頭拍腰！』蕭老頭用拳頭拍着胸脯。</p>
<p>金狗子羞澀地瞥了我一眼，說：『我不要吃，我又不是吃這店里的飯。』</p>
<p>蕭老頭駡他，店里的伙計們勸他，金狗子始終不肯吃飯。於是對於這孩子我十分注視，每次到羊角鎭去，我總找到蕭老頭問金狗子的近况。今年我又到店里結賬，店里的伙計們告訴我金狗子死了；是一天老闆娘打了他一頓，晚上關在店門外面，他坐在階石上凍斃的，死的樣子還是坐得端端正正。</p>
<p>蕭老頭告訴我的消息，是：鄰居的人曾幾次拉他到他們店里去睡，金狗子不肯。於是蕭老頭下的結論是：『我看定這孩子没有好死的，他生就這付賤骨頭！』</p>
<h3>女神</h3>
<p>一陣惡戰，共工的黨徒都倒死在山麓，共工也死在顓顓的刀下。當時顓顓一手提了共工的頭顱，一手拿着血淋淋的铜刀，站在共工屍身之上，作勝利的示威，他想如今殺了共工除了强敵，頃刻之間就可稱霸天下，南面稱尊。（二十）</p>

<h3>Song and Tu Meet in Tianjin, First Negotiating the Eastern Hebei Problem</h3>
<p>The Japanese Side Wants to Resolve the Pinggu Incident First</p>
<p>Xiao Zhenying Visits Tada to Exchange Opinions</p>
<p>Sakagaki Returns to Tianjin to Report on the Negotiations</p>
<p>Japanese Senior Military Officers Hold Important Meeting</p>
<p>Tianjin, 3:00 PM on the 15th, Doihara, accompanied by his Chinese secretary Bao Guancheng, visited Song Zheyuan at No. 137, 17th Road, British Concession. They discussed the Hebei-East and Chahar-East matters for over an hour. Doihara indicated that many minor issues had arisen recently, such as the Chaoyangmen and Dagu incidents involving insults to the Japanese side. These must be resolved completely and guarantees must be made to prevent such incidents from recurring before negotiations on Hebei and Chahar issues can proceed. His intention is to extract significant benefits before easing off on the two sets of negotiations. (Special dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>Tianjin, Xiao Zhenying visited Sakagaki, Tada, and Nagami at the Zhangyuan official residence at 3:00 PM on the 15th to further exchange opinions on the North China situation. He explained the current situation to the Japanese side in detail, speaking sincerely and urging them to realize the reality. He left after an hour. (Special dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>Tianjin, Xiao Zhenying stated that the Hebei-Chahar negotiations should yield results within a week or so. The Japanese side is still represented by Doihara. This decision was made after a request to superiors, and the attitude is still moderate. Our side believes that the Eastern Hebei issue is more important than the Chahar-East issue. Currently, the administrative power of the counties in Chahar-East is still in our hands, with only Mongolian security forces stationed in the county seats. The county magistrates are also appointed by us. Li Shouxin's troops number only about 600 and are scattered in various counties. The situation is tense as Russian and Mongolian troops gather in Ude. If the puppet troops invade west into Wuchuan in Suiyuan, major disputes may arise. The Eastern Hebei situation is extremely important. If a decision is not made quickly, how can we face the people? Therefore, it is in our interest to complete the negotiations as soon as possible. (Special dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>Tianjin, On the 15th, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, Sakagaki, the Chief of Staff of the Tianjin Garrison, Nagami, and the Kwantung Army Staff Officer Kawabe and Toda returned to Tianjin from Beiping. At 2:00 PM, they met with Commander Tada at the Zhangyuan Commander's Residence, along with military attachés stationed in North China, to discuss and decide on measures to deal with the situation in cooperation between the Kwantung Army and the North China Garrison, based on Sakagaki's report on the results of his contacts with various parties in Beiping and Jinan. The meeting adjourned around 3:00 PM. Sakagaki, Kawabe, and Toda are scheduled to leave Tianjin on the 16th to report to Changchun. Military attachés from various locations in North China left Tianjin by night train to return to their posts. (Special dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>Tianjin, It is reported that during the recent Sino-Japanese negotiations in Beiping, the future development of the Eastern Hebei Autonomous Council was discussed, depending on the outcome of the Sino-Japanese negotiations here. Song Zheyuan and Doihara continued their discussions today. Sakagaki arrived here from Beiping this afternoon, accompanied by Nagami and Yu Jing. Xiao Zhenying greeted them at the main station, and they then took the original car to the East Station. (Reuters dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>Beiping, Xiao Zhenying told a guest tonight that he is quite optimistic about the outcome of the Sino-Japanese negotiations, saying that concrete measures are expected to be agreed upon within the next week. He also said that Doihara's return to Tianjin is a good sign because Doihara had said before going to Changchun that he would not return unless the Kwantung Army leaders approved his proposal. The Dagu and Chaoyangmen cases are currently obstacles to the negotiations, but Japanese officials do not seem likely to make unreasonable demands. The Chahar issue will not be mentioned in the current discussions. (Reuters dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>Beiping, The Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Sakagaki, and the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Garrison in Tianjin, Nagami, took a train from here to Tianjin at 9:30 this morning, and are expected to participate in the meeting between Song Zheyuan and Doihara, which began yesterday. Yesterday's first meeting was held at the residence of Tada, the commander of the Japanese Garrison in Tianjin, and it is reported that the Chaoyangmen shooting incident and the future of the so-called "Eastern Hebei Autonomous Government" were discussed.

<h3>President Jiang Met with Representatives of Various Schools</h3>
<p>Lunch Invited to All at the Lizi Society</p>
<p>Hu Shi and Others Express Patriotic Views</p>
<p>Student Representatives Report at the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Nanjing, President Jiang summoned representatives of schools from various places to meet in the capital. The 15th was the first day. More than 300 representatives gathered at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum before 8:30 AM, taking special cars prepared by the Ministry of Education. At 9:00 AM, they performed a memorial service at the mausoleum hall. The representatives stood solemnly, divided into seven rows. Wang Shijie presided over the ceremony. The principals' representatives wore long gowns and mandarin jackets, and the students' representatives wore uniforms. The atmosphere was extremely solemn and orderly. After the ceremony, they took photos and visited scenic spots such as the Ming Mausoleum. At 11:30 AM, they went to the Lizi Society for a luncheon hosted by President Jiang.</p>
<p>All Attended Lunch After the memorial service at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, the representatives of various schools who came to Nanjing had lunch hosted by President Jiang at the Lizi Society at 12:00. More than 300 representatives, the Minister of Education, Zhang Lisheng, and many staff members of the reception office attended. All the representatives wore long gowns and mandarin jackets or uniforms, in an orderly manner. After President Jiang took the main seat, everyone applauded to welcome him. Then, President Jiang stood up and delivered a speech, expressing his welcome and condolences. Immediately, they began to eat. The toasts and exchanges were very harmonious.</p>
<p>The Principals Give Their Opinions At 3:00 PM, President Jiang met with representatives of principals of secondary schools and above from all over the country at the Lizi Society. A total of 89 principals or representatives of colleges and universities and 75 principals of secondary schools attended. First, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education reported the significance of convening the meeting, and then introduced representatives from various places, such as Hu Shi, Zhang Boling, Chu Fucheng, Liu Hongen, Wang Xinggong, etc. It was decided to present the opinions of the education circles in various places on the national crisis and the patriotic movement of students. The consensus was that the government should adhere to the principle of maintaining the integrity of the national territory and sovereignty, and the education circles should trust the government and work together to strive for a common goal. Regarding the patriotic movement of students, it was hoped that the government and the education circles would jointly deal with it properly to maintain the stability of the schools and earnestly train young people for the benefit of the country. After the principals finished their presentations, President Jiang also gave a simple speech, which was extremely sincere and moving.</p>
<p>Student Opinions At 3:00 PM on the 15th, more than 130 student representatives from colleges and universities in various places were in the auditorium of the Executive Yuan, and the government authorities listened to the opinions of the representatives. Because President Jiang was listening to the opinions of the principals at the Lizi Society, Jiang instructed Secretary-General Weng Wenhao to preside over the meeting. Secretary of Education Duan Xipeng and Minister of the Central Organization Department Zhang Lisheng also attended. First, Duan briefly introduced the meeting, and then Weng briefly described the process of convening the representatives to Nanjing. After the speeches, the representatives of various schools spoke one after another, totaling about 50 people. The most important opinions were: Regarding internal affairs, there were severe punishments for traitors and requests for the government to pay attention to the crisis in Eastern Hebei and North China. Regarding diplomacy, there were diplomatic justice, adjustments to the diplomatic ranks, determination of foreign policy, and maintenance of national territorial integrity. Regarding education, there were the establishment of education during the national crisis, opposition to arbitrary revisions of textbooks, and intensified physical training. There were also opinions on industry and economy. The general mood was enthusiastic and激昂, and the intentions were practical and positive. The atmosphere was good. The meeting lasted for four hours and adjourned at 7:00 PM. It is said that the number of written opinions submitted by the representatives was also quite large.</p>
<p>Today's Program The 16th is the second day of the representatives' meeting.

<h3>Military and Police of Various Schools Withdraw The Guangzhou Market is Peaceful</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, Guangzhou was still under martial law on the night of the 14th, with military and police densely deployed. Traffic was cut off from 12:00 AM to dawn, but there were no unexpected events. The end of the old year is approaching, and it is extremely difficult for businesses to collect debts. The authorities plan to lift martial law early on the 22nd (Special dispatch from the 15th) Li Shuzong said that starting from the morning of the 15th, large groups of police and military police in the city had withdrawn, and military police were still stationed on major roads. The search of various schools on the 14th yielded nothing. The military and police of various schools withdrew on the 15th, and the city has calmed down. The temporary martial law headquarters will be dissolved in the next few days. (Special dispatch from the 15th)</p>

<h3>The Respective Personnel for Sino-Japanese Envoys Have Not Yet Been Mutually Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>Nanjing, There have been many rumors recently about the personnel for Sino-Japanese diplomatic envoys. According to diplomatic sources, although there are plans for the successor to the Chinese Ambassador to Japan, it has not been completely determined. Therefore, it has not yet been submitted to the Japanese government for consent. As for the Japanese Ambassador to China, Japanese news reports say that Hachiro Arita will succeed him, but we have not yet sought consent. It can be seen from the facts that I came to China in February without receiving a report. (Special dispatch from the 15th)</p>

<h3>New Harvests in Children's Year</h3>
<p>— Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>The New Youth published by Kaiming Bookstore has been released. After briefly reading it, I feel that the content is very substantial, and I am very willing to seriously introduce it to colleagues in the education field and enlightened parents.</p>
<p>Excellent reading materials are the "spiritual food" for young boys and girls. I don't want to say more about how important its role in education is, because everyone has known it for a long time. I don't want to say more about how scarce the things suitable for young boys and girls to read are in my country's publishing industry at present, because this is a fact that everyone has already felt. What I want to point out here are the several characteristics of New Youth:</p>
<p>The first point is that the main purpose of New Youth is "to enable young people to appreciate literature and art, understand nature, and understand society," which almost includes all knowledge, regardless of any aspect. Judging from the inaugural issue, the content is also novel and lively, which can greatly supplement the deficiencies of primary and secondary school textbooks.</p>
<p>The second point is that in the past, Chinese people had a contemptuous attitude towards children's publications or youth publications, thinking that these were just naive children's publications or youth publications. Therefore, successful writers often disdain to contribute to such publications, which has to be said to be a wrong concept. The editors and contributors of New Youth, such as Mao Dun, Shen Congwen, Zikai, Zhonghua, Junzheng... and other gentlemen are all well-known writers. It seems that there has never been such a concentration of human resources and full efforts to engage in this before.</p>
<p>The third point is that the content of general children's reading materials or youth reading materials often tends to be "shallow" because they strive for "simplicity." The articles collected in the inaugural issue of New Youth are neither too difficult nor lost in "shallowness." However, in terms of writing, the overall keynote seems to be slightly heavy.</p>
<p>The 24th year of the Republic of China is the "Children's Year" stipulated by the Ministry of Education. The so-called Children's Year, in addition to the several enthusiastic opening ceremonies held in major cities across the country in early September last year, seems to have no sound now. This cannot be blamed on anyone for not working hard. The implementation of any large-scale undertaking in a country is related to the entire political and economic situation. It is not something that a small group of people can do out of thin air. However, being able to do a little in any aspect, no matter how big or small, is always meaningful to the entire society. The publishing industry and the education field originally have an inseparable relationship. Good publications in the publishing industry give great help to the education field. In this sense, the publication of the New Youth of Kaiming Bookstore can really be said to be a valuable harvest of Children's Year.</p>
<h3>Writing Something</h3>
<h3>Ye Shaojun</h3>
<p>——Preface to "Unsatisfied Residence Practice"—</p>
<p>My essays were once combined with Mr. Yu Pingbo's essays ten years ago and named Scabbard, published by Pushe. The later writings, after some selection, were named Footsteps Collection, published by New China Bookstore. After the collection was published, looking at it myself, I always felt that there were not many articles that looked like essays. The elimination was not necessarily clean, which caused deep shame. In the past two or three years, I have written some more essays. Friends advised me to publish another book. So I also selected these new works, and added some of the more decent articles from Scabbard and Footsteps Collection, and added a few articles that could not be found at that time, to become this collection.</p>
<p>I often think that those who aspire to painting, no matter what style they like, or what style they are prepared to create, they always have to start with charcoal practice. The same is true for those who aspire to literature and art. Writing freely about their experiences and ideas is their charcoal practice. Unfortunately, our former Chinese teachers did not pay much attention to this point. The topics they gave often taught us to look for something to say outside of our own experiences and ideas, which caused us to suffer no small losses in technical training. If you suffer a loss, you can only think of a remedy. Write about whatever experience you have, write about whatever ideas you have. On the one hand, you can let people see it, and on the other hand, it is like learning to draw a plaster head. Even if you don't have big ambitions and don't plan to write any great works that will be passed down to future generations, such training is also beneficial. Being able to write out your own experiences and ideas smoothly and happily will bring a lot of convenience in daily life. I wrote some essays with this idea, so I gave this collection the name "Practice."</p>
<h3>Talking About Natural Science Essays</h3>
<p>— Shu Ming</p>
<p>Since Mr. Chen Wangdao put forward the term "scientific essay," many people have given it definitions, set goals, and classified it, making the deserted "free talk" lively. Although there were no results in the end, at least the four words "scientific essay" have been deeply imprinted in the minds of the public. I think this effort is by no means in vain.</p>
<p>However, for this round of debate, I often feel that there is too much abstract theory and too little actual observation. Some people divide scientific essays into natural science essays and social science essays, which is no big deal, but some people are arguing about whether natural science essays are more important or social science essays are more important. I think this is unnecessary, because whoever likes what, must think what is most important; for example, the eyes are the most important, but the deaf don't think so, saying that the ears are the most important, and the blind don't want to agree. In fact, without social science, not to mention that the Soviet Union is still Tsarist Russia, but without natural science, the Five-Year Plan would probably become a Fifty-Year Plan. I think if someone writes social science essays, let him write them. If someone writes natural science essays, let him write them too. As long as someone writes them, it is always good. Since we don't want to throw unimportant things into the latrine, why should we argue about who is more important?</p>
<p>Some people advocate that natural science essays must pass the "sense of society." I admire this idea very much, but I always feel that it is a bit like "bargaining in the air." The topics of natural science essays always cannot be separated from natural phenomena; natural phenomena vary greatly. Some are closely related to daily life, some are related, but not closely, and some have no direct relationship with life at all. To be considered a natural science essay, it must pass the "sense of society," which gives natural science essays an invisible chain. The result is either畸形 development or夭折. The topics of biological phenomena can still be personified, or related to human life through their economic relationship, but the topics of astronomical phenomena and physical and chemical phenomena are even more difficult. Because astronomical, physical, and chemical phenomena are originally dead things, and there are many topics that are not easy to make them contact with human life. If we want to, we will have many ambiguities and problems. Kentell (Kenda), who revised the chemistry textbook for Smith, pointed out in his At Home Among the Atoms that when the Austrian young physicist Schrödinger sang the theory of atomic waves, a certain major newspaper in the United States had a paragraph introducing it, saying:</p>
<p>"The next time you go to buy atoms, you must declare that you want the Schrödinger brand. Don't let the store confuse you with Bohr's old stock from a few years ago. In the future, you must always pay attention to whether that thing is outdated."</p>
<p>Kent believes that although this kind of description is easy to understand, it is also very harmful. People who read the newspaper will definitely turn their minds to the fact that our scientific laws and theories are just瞎guess, which can be outdated at any time. In the end, who wants to understand science?</p>
<p>In fact, the question of how to write scientific essays is not enough with abstract theory alone. To make the theory practical, you have to make actual observations from the works.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that Kaiming Bookstore has published three collections of works by Mr. Keshi Jia Zuzhang and Gu Junzheng, who have been working hard to write natural science essays since 1934, named Flowers, Birds, Insects and Fish, Biological Elements, and Scientific Interest. Because I have met these three authors, the heart of "mooching" suddenly arises. As a result, not only did I get the three books in hand, but I also had the "pleasure of seeing them first." I spent one night reading all 64 works. The first feeling after reading them was: these three books are more meaningful than those published in magazines from the standpoint of mass education, because there are a total of 88 illustrations—everyone knows that illustrations are a tool to express mass knowledge more vividly and clearly than words.</p>
<p>For these three collections, I think each has its own style and each has its own techniques. I can't point out which one is the most adorable, I just feel that every one looks "refreshing," but none of them deviate from the correctness of science. To analyze the content and form of each book and then derive a theory of how to write scientific essays, I want to do this work, but it takes a little more effort. I can only apologize to the readers here, and hope that others will take on this work together.</p>
<h3>New Youth Solicitation</h3>
<p>Since the publication of the inaugural issue of this magazine, it has been greatly supported by all parties, and the number of copies printed has reached more than 100,000, which is still difficult to distribute. The colleagues are very grateful for this special honor and can only work harder in order to live up to the expectations of 100,000 readers. However, the abilities and knowledge of the colleagues are limited, and there may be shortcomings. How this magazine will be improved in the future depends on the supervision and encouragement of the readers. It is now planned to use the position of the "Book Club" to open a special issue, asking readers to express their great opinions on the following two topics, in order to make it a compass for editing, which is deeply hoped for. The text is limited to about 1,000 words, and the deadline is February 10th. (1) Reading the inaugural issue of "New Youth", (2) What I hope for "New Youth". Sincerely, New Youth Society</p>
<h3>Preface to "Flat House Essays"</h3>
<p>— Xia Gaizun</p>
<p>Putting together some of the writings and paying to print them into a book is called Flat House Essays.</p>
<p>Since the ancestral home was sold, I have not had my own house to live in. The construction of several small flat houses on Baima Lake is a major event worth commemorating in my life. Most of the writings collected in the collection were not written in the flat house, but almost all of them were written after the flat house was built. The earliest was in the tenth year of the Republic of China, which was the year the flat house was built. Looking at the nature of the text, there are reviews, novels, and essays. Each type has a small amount, and they are all improper. The reviews are not like reviews, the novels are not like novels, and the essays are not like essays. Recently, someone created a new term, "essay," to call improper things "essays." I think my writings are just right to be called essays, so I decided on this book title.</p>
<p>I am indeed "not very hardworking" in literature, as Mr. Zhao Jingshen said in the Lin magazine of the Libao. I do not consider myself worthy of being a writer. I do not write many things, and I do not remember or preserve them myself. The collection and printing this time is entirely due to the persuasion of several friends. Among the friends, Mr. Zheng Zhenduo is the most persuasive. In the past year, he talked about publishing a collection almost every time he saw me.</p>
<p>My eldest daughter, Jizi, is the one who usually cares about my writings. She had prepared to do the work of collecting them for me. Unfortunately, she died of illness this summer and did not have time to read her father's writings in her father's collection again!</p>
<h3>"Historical Sketches"</h3>
<p>— Yun Bin</p>
<p>Recently, people often write historical subjects into a new form of essay. Guo Moruo's "Qin Shi Huang About to Die," published in Zhi Wen (Issue 4), can be said to be a masterpiece of this kind of essay. Guo's literary talent is admired by the general public. Since his exile to Japan, he has devoted himself to the study of social sciences. In order to understand the situation of ancient Chinese society, he has also engaged in the study of oracle bone inscriptions and bronze inscriptions, and has made amazing achievements in several aspects. His emotions are unrestrained, his writing is fluent, and his mind is meticulous. Therefore, the historical essays he writes are extraordinary. In that essay "Qin Shi Huang About to Die," he tells us that history says that Qin Huang had a bee-like nose, long eyes, a startled-crow chest, and a jackal's voice. A startled-crow chest is now called a chicken chest, which is a characteristic of rickets. It can be seen that Qin Shi Huang suffered from rickets since he was a child, so his body was unhealthy. As a result, two kinds of abnormal behaviors were revealed: one was to hate the health of others, developing a murderous and tyrannical nature; the other was to believe in immortals and willingly be deceived by alchemists. He also tells us that Qin Shi Huang's biological father, Lü Buwei, served as the prime minister for more than ten years. The official title of prime minister is very unfamiliar, so he added a note: "Prime minister is the same as chancellor. Because the Han people avoided Liu Bang's name, they changed 'bang' to 'guo'." He also tells us that Qin Shi Huang's name was Zheng. The Qin people even avoided the character "zheng," so the first month was renamed "duan yue." However, Zhao Gao and Li Si colluded to forge Qin Shi Huang's edict, but used the verb "kuang zheng," deliberately violating the taboo to show that it was Qin Shi Huang's own tone, so that Fusu and Meng Tian would not suspect it. All of this can show that Guo's reading has yielded results. Of course, his motivation for writing this essay was not to show his erudition, but to satirize the despotic tyrant who wanted to unify thought by violence, and who only realized at the time of his death that he was "the first big cucumber in history." He describes Qin Shi Huang sleeping in a temperature-controlled carriage, repenting of the past, and complaining to himself: "Damn it, you can't burn all the books in the world, and you can't bury all the thinkers in the world alive! Even if you burn them all, and bury them all alive, what will you have?" If Jin Shengtan were alive, he would definitely comment below: "This is the truth! This is the reason! Let all the despotic tyrants and dictatorial leaders in the world listen!"</p>
<p>Writing historical essays is by no means simply rewriting a certain historical story. It must be infused with a little new meaning. Like Mao Dun's "Daze Township," it is also a successful work. Recently, I was entrusted by the editor of "New Youth" to write a historical essay for each issue. I don't have the talent and accomplishment of Guo Moruo and Mao Dun. I know that imitating them will only make me look uglier. In the first issue, I reluctantly wrote an essay called "Jizhu Elegy." I was not satisfied with it after reading it myself, because it was just rewriting the historical story without any new meaning. But I thought of many other topics and planned to continue writing. For example, the story of Lord Mengchang sending his retainer Feng Xuan to the state of Xue to collect debts can reflect the exploitation of peasants by feudal lords through high-interest loans in the Warring States period. Another example is the abdication of Yao and Shun, which may have been the election of the commander-in-chief of military affairs in a clan society. We might as well use imagination to describe the situation at that time (naturally, there is also some basis, not entirely out of imagination), so that readers will know that the so-called "abdication" was nothing more than this. This kind of topic may be a bit beneficial to "New Youth" readers—at least it is more meaningful than reading ordinary historical stories such as "Kong Rong Giving Away Pears" and "Yue Fei Tattooing His Back," I think.</p>
<p>After reading Guo Moruo's historical essay and looking at my own writing, I feel infinitely ashamed, so I wrote this short article in a rambling way; it is not that I want to write historical essays and deliberately pull two famous writers to accompany me.</p>
<h3>Book Selection and Abridgment</h3>
<p>— Qi Chong</p>
<p>When eating vegetables, one should pick the best parts to eat. The dishes brought by the cook may not all be good, and even in a good dish, there are bound to be some things that do not suit one's taste. If one does not choose when eating, and just puts everything into one's mouth, it would be too late to go to the doctor when one gets sick. Reading is like eating vegetables, one must choose the essence to read.</p>
<p>The books published by the publishing industry are as vast as the sea, and our time and energy for reading are limited. It is practically impossible to read all the books in this vast sea. However, it is indeed more beneficial to try to read a few more books within our possible range. Therefore, the saying that we must choose the essence to read has considerable significance.</p>
<p>There are many books that are dross and not worth a second glance. Even in a famous book, it is not easy to find that everything is elite and there is no dross at all. Since we want to read more books, it would be best if someone could choose a few good books for us and also clear away the dross in these good books. Although this is an excessive extravagance, it is also a sincere request from the reading community. Therefore, abridged books are very necessary.</p>
<p>The work of making abridged books must be done by famous experts. This is not my idol worship. It is because the person who does the abridgment must be well-versed in the book in order to remove the dross and leave the essence. Otherwise, they may remove the essence and leave the dross. Many people don't like to read abridged books, perhaps for this reason. Therefore, I think that the publishing industry should pay attention to this point when doing the work of abridging books.</p>
<p>Those engaged in abridgment work must stand on the standpoint of organization, remove the less suitable parts of a book, and at the same time not hinder the continuity, so that readers can save time and energy, and not reduce their knowledge and interest in a certain book. Of course, this kind of work is very suitable for Chinese ancient books, and may be one kind of "organizing national heritage" work.</p>
<p>Now students have very heavy homework, and they still find it difficult to understand their homework even if they work hard at their desks all day long. It goes without saying that they want to read one or two extracurricular books. Therefore, Ms. Chen Hengzhe shouted "Save the middle school students," and everyone responded. I think that doing the work of abridging books is also a way to "save the middle school students."</p>
<p>Recently, Kaiming Bookstore has published "Abridged Novels," inviting experts to narrate and revise several famous old novels, removing the dross and leaving the essence. We naturally believe that they can meet the conditions of this word "abridged."</p>
<p>Now the publishing industry is very keen on reprinting ancient books. I think that instead of blindly reprinting them, it is better to organize the ancient books first, remove the dross, preserve the essence, and then reprint them. This kind of reprinting of ancient books is a work that is beneficial to the academic community! However, it should be noted that the person who does the abridgment should be a scholar who has thoroughly studied the book. At the same time, I hope that Kaiming Bookstore will continue to work hard in this area, and that in the near future, in addition to the already published "Dream of the Red Chamber," "Water Margin," and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," there will be other abridged books published. After the manuscript is published, a cash payment or Kaiming Bookstore book vouchers will be paid. Manuscripts will not be returned, nor will they be answered in advance.</p>

<h3>The Influence of Japan's Withdrawal from the Naval Conference</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>The London Naval Conference, which had been adjourned and extended several times, and which involved individual negotiations, was deadlocked due to the formation of a united front by the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy, who advocated "exchanging information on shipbuilding procedures," which was in opposition to Japan's proposal to "establish a common maximum amount system to implement quantitative restrictions on naval forces." The Japanese delegation notified the delegations of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy of its intention to withdraw from the conference the day before yesterday. Thus, the naval conference, which had attracted worldwide attention, tolled its sad bell. Recalling the day when the naval conference opened in the Locarno Room of the British Foreign Office, how enthusiastic the politicians of various countries were about arms reduction! The result of more than a month of negotiations is such that we cannot help but be dumbfounded.</p>
<p>The inevitable failure of the London Naval Conference and Japan's inevitable declaration of withdrawal from the conference as a last resort were determined by the objective international political situation. Therefore, Japan's withdrawal from the conference is not surprising. However, what kind of changes will the breakdown of the naval conference cause, and what will be its impact on the situation in Europe and the Far East are indeed important issues that deserve consideration.</p>
<p>We believe that after Japan's withdrawal from the naval conference, its direct impact will be approximately four points. First, the despair of naval compromise will inevitably lead to more intense naval competition. U.S. Secretary of the Navy Swanson publicly stated on the eighth of this month that "the implementation of the shipbuilding plan will be determined after waiting for the results of the conference." The Navy Department of the United States is also constantly concerned about the current state of naval defense in the Pacific. France and Italy's plans to add warships have been proceeding since the Anglo-German naval agreement was established in May of last year. From then on, various countries will inevitably accelerate the process in order to avoid falling behind. It is now widely rumored in London that the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy will sign an agreement containing ladder-type clauses to increase their naval forces in the same proportion as countries outside the Four-Power Pact. There is no need to elaborate on the outcome of the naval race. Second, since compromise is hopeless, all agreements on limiting and fortifying naval armaments will inevitably become invalid. The issue of fortification in various islands in the Pacific will become the focus of the naval confrontation between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. Third, the Japanese delegation's insistence on the common maximum amount system and the insistence on quantitative restrictions, in terms of political issues, is to insist on the monopoly of East Asia and not allow the great powers to have any say. This principle is indeed unacceptable to the representatives of various countries. However, judging from the objective situation, it is difficult for the great powers to have a consistent anti-Japanese front in the Far East due to different interests and different goals. Therefore, when the conference was on the verge of collapse, the United Kingdom, which has vast interests in the Far East, suddenly softened its attitude towards Japan and proposed to use the Anglo-Japanese Agreement on China as a condition for exchanging the situation at the conference. This was actually revealed by Foreign Secretary Eden. This fully exposes the true face of imperialism. Fourth, if the United Kingdom does conduct a separate agreement with Japan on China, the result will inevitably lead to the United States also withdrawing from the conference. Thus, Anglo-American cooperation will become a bubble, and the role of the naval conference will be limited to local European issues. Even if representatives from Germany and Russia participate, or Greece, Spain, Sweden, Norway, and other countries are invited to join again, the scope of discussion will only be limited to adjusting the new situation created after the establishment of the Anglo-German naval agreement. Moreover, it is doubtful whether Germany and Russia, which are at odds with each other, can participate in unity.</p>
<p>In short, although there is still news that the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy will continue the meeting after Japan's withdrawal from the conference, it is only to exchange opinions on the shipbuilding plans of various countries in order to end the situation. It is impossible to make any remedy for the future of the naval conference.</p>

<p>British Newspaper Comments on the Far East Situation</p>
<p>London. The News Chronicle recently published a detailed analysis of Japan's recent actions in northern China, stating, "The Kwantung Army of Japan does not want to be subject to the control of Tokyo in the implementation of its policy of aggression against China. It can be seen that although the Chinese government has made extreme concessions to Japan's recent demands, it has not been effective. Or perhaps the purpose of the Chinese government in adopting this attitude is to delay time, waiting for the League of Nations to handle the Italian-Ethiopian dispute and restore its authority, so that China can reapply to the League of Nations for protection, which may be more likely to succeed. Japan is taking advantage of the League of Nations' current inability to take into account the Far East issue to plunder as much of mainland China's land as possible, so that when the League of Nations decides to impose sanctions on Japan and these sanctions are implemented, Japan will have nothing to fear."

<h3>Japan Withdraws from Naval Conference, Promoting British-American Cooperation, Mutual Understanding Prevents Arms Race, Britain to Reconsider Position in the Pacific, Five-Power Representatives Hold Final Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>London. After today's naval conference, Japan will undoubtedly withdraw. When the U.S. Representative Davis entered the meeting, he expressed his opinion that this would be the final meeting of the Five-Power Conference. (Reuters Dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>London. According to the naval correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, after Japan's withdrawal from the naval conference, there may be new developments in the Pacific. If the U.S. government decides to implement its plan to create a new naval base, Britain will be forced to reconsider its position in the Pacific. For example, the defense of Hong Kong, which has not been addressed for sixteen years, is now outdated. The correspondent also said that Japan's actions would not cause an arms race, as Britain and the United States have reached an understanding regarding each other's military strength, and the two countries can therefore avoid the possibility of competing in shipbuilding. Japan's tough stance has forced the United States to complete its massive naval shipbuilding program. By 1942, the United States Navy will be able to hold the reins of the world.</p>
<p>It is widely expected that Japan will formally announce its withdrawal from the conference when the Naval Conference considers Japan's demand for equality at the third adjournment session this afternoon. It is believed that Japan's proposal will be rejected when put to a vote, thus ending Japan's participation. At the same time, it is reported that the British and American delegations met for two hours yesterday and rejected Japan's claim that the Naval Conference could continue legally after Japan's withdrawal.

<p>General Committee Meeting Procedures</p>
<p>London.

However, the Japanese statement will be very lengthy, and today's meeting time is limited. According to the original procedure, after the Japanese representative reads the statement, the U.S. representative will speak first. The United States fears that the General Committee will announce an adjournment immediately after the U.S. representative expresses his opinion, and the outside impression will be that only the United States opposes Japan's request. Therefore, it intends to propose to the General Committee that it adjourn until Thursday immediately after the Japanese representative finishes his speech, so that the United States, France, Britain, and Italy can express their opinions in turn."

<p>Tokyo. Today, as a result of consultations between the Ministry of the Navy and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a notice of withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference was drafted. It is reliably learned that the content is very brief, roughly as follows:</p>
<p>"Since the Japanese Imperial Government's proposal for setting a common maximum limit for quantitative restrictions has not been approved by various countries, it will not be able to attend the meeting and participate in discussions in the future. However, all the countries that have participated in the meeting since its opening have considered the Japanese proposal in a friendly spirit, and we sincerely express our gratitude for this." (Domei News Agency Dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>London. It has just been learned that the notice of Japan's withdrawal from the Naval Conference will be delivered in writing on Thursday (the 16th) by Admiral Nagano, the country's chief representative, to British Foreign Secretary Eden, chairman of the Naval Conference. Unless the country's delegation receives new instructions from Tokyo, this attitude will not change. The wording of the notice will be sent to Eden in advance for his approval. It is not yet known whether Japan will appoint an observer to remain here after withdrawing from the conference. If there is a need to appoint one, it will be a military attaché from the Japanese Embassy in Britain. (Havas Dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Private British-American Talks, Agree to Continue Four-Nation Conference</h3>
<p>London. The British and American delegations held private talks on the morning of the 14th, adjourning after an hour and a half. According to their content, the two sides decided to continue the four-nation conference after Japan's withdrawal. In addition, the representatives of each country were originally scheduled to explain their opinions after the Japanese representatives explained the common maximum plan at the First Committee on the 15th. However, it is expected that the Japanese representatives' explanation will be very long on that day, and the representatives of each country should also express their opinions as much as possible to clarify that the responsibility for the breakdown of the conference lies with Japan. Therefore, the First Committee on the 15th should not be the final meeting, but should be reconvened to allow the representatives of each country to fully criticize the Japanese explanation. As a result of the exchange of opinions between the British and American representatives, it was decided to reconvene the First Committee on the 17th. (Domei News Agency Dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>London. As a result of the British-American talks, the First Committee will be reconvened on the 17th. This will be the last meeting attended by the Japanese representatives. It is expected that the representatives of each country will criticize the four proposals together. Chairman Monsell will ask Japan to send an observer to attend the four-nation conference after a certain committee adjourns. It is widely expected that the four-nation conference will begin on the 20th. (Domei News Agency Dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>British Attitude Turns Tough, Naval Conference Will Not End Due to Japan's Withdrawal</h3>
<p>Tokyo. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a report from the Japanese delegation on the evening of the 14th regarding the content of the British-Japanese talks on the 13th, and knew that the breakdown of the conference was inevitable. Therefore, the action of withdrawing from the conference was fully entrusted to the plenipotentiary to implement. According to the content of the report, Plenipotentiary Nagano received instructions from the government on the 12th to prepare to explain the termination of the conference after Japan abandoned disarmament. On the 13th, he spoke at the British-Japanese talks, saying that if the countries could not recognize Japan's disarmament plan, then the five-nation conference should be considered to have broken down and immediate action should be taken to deal with the aftermath. Regarding issues such as prohibiting the arming of merchant ships and restricting the use of submarines, which have the possibility of being resolved, a treaty should be concluded to complete the conference. The British representative replied that since Japan hoped for the successful conclusion of the conference, the conference needed to hear Japan's detailed explanation of its disarmament policy, and at the same time review the notification plan for shipbuilding for a part of the quantitative restriction issue. If Japan does not agree, it can take free action, but the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy will continue to hold a four-nation conference and recognize this conference as an extended meeting convened in accordance with the current treaty for the disarmament conference. Issues such as submarines and merchant ships will not be addressed until the fundamental issues are resolved. Britain's words and actions seemed to express blatant opinions. If Japan wants to withdraw, it can withdraw. If it does not withdraw, it must participate in the review of the shipbuilding notification plan. The conference will never end due to Japan's withdrawal. If Japan takes the step of withdrawing from the conference, it does not need to participate in the joint declaration. Regarding the agreement on issues such as submarines and merchant ships, the Japanese representative, due to Britain's sudden expression of such a tough attitude without making concessions, had little room to return to the government for instructions to complete the conference in a satisfactory atmosphere.

<h3>Tokyo to Issue Declaration, Clarifying Position to Home and Abroad</h3>
<p>Tokyo. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from the Japanese delegation late on the night of the 14th. As a result of a meeting of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' leadership held at 10:00 AM this morning, it was decided to hold a joint meeting of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Navy immediately. After consultations, it was decided to formally notify that it would not participate in the conference at the best time, and to send an observer to attend future meetings. The government has decided to appoint Plenipotentiary Nagai as an observer to stay in Britain to handle all matters after the breakdown and to carry out diplomatic follow-up work. After Japan formally withdraws from the conference, Prime Minister Okada will issue a statement clarifying the government's views on disarmament and asking the people to be prepared. Foreign Minister Hirota will also declare to China and foreign countries Japan's true intention of loving international peace, and that Japan is always prepared to participate in a newly convened conference if the countries understand Japan's disarmament policy. At the same time, Navy Minister Osumi and Army Minister Kawashima will express their views separately, clarifying the economic and national defense policies that Japan should take after the start of the arms race, and asking the entire country to unite to overcome the difficulties. (Domei News Agency Dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>London. The spokesman for the Japanese delegation to the Naval Conference recently made a statement to the press, clarifying the delegation's intentions, saying, "Admiral Nagano, the chief representative of Japan, will explain in detail Japan's proposals and its plans at the General Committee of the Naval Conference. We advocate that each naval power should adjust the proposed common maximum amount according to its geographical situation and national defense needs. If this plan is rejected, the conference will inevitably break down. After we withdraw from the conference, we are willing to leave an observer, but this still depends on the nature of the invitation received by this observer. We are extremely eager to avoid further deterioration of the feelings of all parties, and we do not believe that the naval arms race will begin as a result of our withdrawal from the conference. Although the current U.S. plan to actively build ships to reach the limits of the current treaty has caused a sense of unease in Japan, Japan still has no intention of building ships on a large scale to compete with the navies of Britain and the United States. Therefore, unless other countries create an atmosphere of naval competition, Japan is unwilling to be the initiator. However, the Washington and London Naval Treaties have proven to be unsuitable for Japan's national defense needs, and the naval ratio system established by the Washington Treaty is particularly unfair to Japan. We have not seen any reason to extend its validity and make it permanent." (Havas Dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>British Naval Circles Advocate Inviting Russia and Germany to Participate</h3>
<p>London. Naval circles believe that Japan will withdraw from the Naval Conference in two days (i.e., the 16th), which is now a confirmed fact. However, the current naval treaty will expire at the end of this year, so the Japanese government has eleven months to study the results of the Naval Conference. After that, the Japanese government may express its approval of some resolutions of the Naval Conference (i.e., the so-called qualitative restrictions, rules restricting the use of submarines, and extending the deadline for restrictions on the construction of fortifications on Pacific islands, etc.). British naval circles continue to hold sympathetic views on the possibility of inviting Germany and Russia to join the conference, so that general consultations can continue on the two cases of mutually notifying shipbuilding procedures and qualitative restrictions. However, regarding this level, Britain has not yet made a practical proposal to other countries' representatives. It is generally expected that the issue will not be clearly understood until Japan's withdrawal from the conference is seen as a fact and the opinions of other countries' delegations are tested, so that it can be proved that this procedure is generally approved by all parties. (Havas Dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>The United States Remains Silent for the Time Being, Will Deal with It with a Philosophical Attitude</h3>
<p>Washington. After the news of Japan's decision to withdraw from the Naval Conference reached here, Secretary of State Hull was unwilling to make comments because the country had not yet formally submitted a notification. It is generally believed that officials will deal with this matter with a "philosophical" attitude. Since the preliminary negotiations of the Naval Conference began to be held at the end of 1934 until today, the positions adopted by Japan and the United States have been incompatible. The United States has long believed that the hope of the Naval Conference's success is extremely slim, and it is clear even before Japan withdraws from the conference. As far as the course of the Naval Conference's discussions is concerned, the mutual support of the two major English-speaking countries is clearly visible. This relationship is extremely important in future world politics. According to naval circles, Britain and the United States are expected to reach an agreement on the issue of qualitative restrictions, and have indeed decided to maintain the current naval ratio. Once Japan expands its naval armaments, Britain and the United States will each build two ships for every ship built by Japan to deal with it. This will inevitably maintain its existing naval superiority, as the two countries have far more abundant financial resources than Japan. (Havas Dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Paris Feels Uneasy</h3>
<p>Paris. The Japanese delegation's decision to withdraw from the Naval Conference, although somewhat expected, has shaken naval circles here upon the news' arrival. In recent days, naval circles have still hoped that the attitude of the Japanese delegation might become slightly more moderate, so that naval talks would still leave some possibility. This hope has now been dashed, and since one of the world's strongest naval powers cannot participate, an important naval agreement cannot be signed, and the importance of the Naval Conference will be largely lost. At the same time, what will be the future of France's proposal to notify each other of shipbuilding procedures and qualitative restrictions within a year? Naval circles are also quite uneasy about this. However, it is generally believed that it is still too early to predict the future progress of the Naval Conference. (Havas Dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Maintaining Far Eastern Interests, Sending Amorous Glances to Japan</h3>
<p>Paris. The famous journalist Madame Tabouis recently published a long article in the Business Report commenting on the London Naval Conference, briefly stating that France has interests in the Far East, especially in China and especially in Vietnam, so it should maintain the best possible relationship with Japan. If Japan does withdraw from the Naval Conference and the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy continue to meet, then the French representative must pay attention to preventing the future meetings from becoming anti-Japanese in nature. "As for France's proposal, judging from the opinions we have expressed previously, the path that can be developed in the future can be summarized as follows: France does not oppose in principle the naval equality rights requested by the Japanese representatives, but since the issues contained in this principle are not within the scope of the Naval Conference's authority and cannot be resolved in practice, the French representative does not want to support the Japanese proposal in view of this. In fact, France's proposal to exchange shipbuilding information between countries is far more similar to Japan's proposal than the British proposal. However, there is a major difference between the French and Japanese proposals, namely that France requires the highest naval quota to be shared only by the five major naval powers, while Japan advocates that all countries in the world, without distinction, should use this highest quota as a standard." Madame Tabouis then said that France has always believed that land and naval armaments are interdependent and must be taken into account at the same time, so it has never placed extravagant hopes on previous naval conferences, and it does not dare to expect much from this London Naval Conference.

<h3>U.S. Military Aircraft Practice Formation Flying</h3>
<p>Miami, USA. Twenty-five U.S. Marine Corps aircraft flew to San Juan, Puerto Rico today for practice flights, which will take about a month. The leader is Colonel Gaynor. (National News Agency Dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Military Spending Increases Sharply, More Than Doubling Last Year</h3>
<p>Moscow. Since Soviet military strength has become strong, the Central Executive Committee held a meeting today, and the Finance Committee submitted Grinko's 1936 budget proposal, in which military expenditures nearly doubled compared to 1935, in order to make the Soviet Union's combat power complete and without regret. The total amount of the budget proposal is 7,500,000,000 rubles, and military spending accounts for 14,800,000,000 rubles. The increased funds will be used for the political education of the Red Army, increasing the number of soldiers, sending technical equipment, and modernizing barracks. Grinko explained the government's fiscal policy, aiming to stabilize the ruble, and denied foreign rumors of lowering the value of the currency or issuing new currency. (Reuters Dispatch on the 14th)</p>

<h3>Another U.S. Plane Crash, 17 Killed</h3>
<p>New York. A U.S. Airlines transcontinental plane crashed today carrying seventeen passengers. On a flight from New York to Los Angeles, after flying over the border of Tennessee and Arkansas, the plane suddenly nosedived and crashed into a swamp. Rescue teams rushed to the rescue and found the fuselage in five feet of water, but fourteen passengers and three drivers had all died, and the bodies were not easy to retrieve. Among the passengers were ten men, three women, and one child. The plane was a Douglas-type, equipped with two engines. It is reported that one of the thrusters was lost, causing the disaster. The company and the Department of Commerce are now immediately jointly investigating the cause of the accident. This is the U.S. aviation history's worst plane crash in terms of loss of life. Rescuers searched in the mud for four hours before finding the fuselage. The corpses were scattered within one hundred yards of where the fuselage was located. (Reuters Dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Senior German Army, Navy, and Air Force Officers Meeting, Hitler's Position Stabilized</h3>
<p>London. According to a dispatch from the Times of London's Berlin correspondent, senior German army, navy, and air force officers have held meetings many times, and representatives of the Nazi Party's Black Guard and Brown Shirts have also participated from time to time, which has aroused various speculations. German newspapers never say a word about the meeting. Hitler's government is not showing any signs of shaking at the moment, but for the sake of government stability, it may be necessary to discuss and understand the scope of the right to govern clearly and realistically. This section raises questions again, namely, can soldiers in the entire country not be political groups, and at the same time require political groups to obey military administration? Soldiers will of course monitor the Black Guard, and the Black Guard can serve as Hitler's trusted guard and guerrillas in the event of internal unrest. It is reported that the Black Guard has a total of 12,000 officers and soldiers, divided into four legions, stationed in various parts of Germany. They have obviously been carefully trained, and the army is equipped with rifles, machine guns, and armored vehicles. Recently, it has been reported that the army has increased to 16,000 people and has added anti-aircraft artillery units and signal units. (Reuters Dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Polish Foreign Policy: Maintaining Peace as the Guiding Principle</h3>
<p>Warsaw: Colonel Beck, the Foreign Minister, recently reported to the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on foreign policy, stating briefly that Poland, regarding the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, does not take sides, and its relations with both Britain and Italy are satisfactory. Poland's attitude is guided by the principle of maintaining peace, and it enjoys good relations with all its neighboring countries, except for Lithuania, with which diplomatic relations are "not yet enlightened." As for the relationship between Poland and Czechoslovakia, improvement is hoped for depending on Czechoslovakia's expression of sincerity. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: It has been learned that the national defense budget for the fiscal year 1936-37 amounts to 759,000,000 zlotys (Polish currency), accounting for 34% of the total budget, a decrease of 2,000,000 zlotys compared to the fiscal year 1935-36. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Kipling's Condition Remains Critical</h3>
<p>London: Kipling's condition remains a cause for concern. However, the report at 3:50 this morning stated that he slept peacefully.

<h3>British Novelist Dies from Coal Gas Poisoning</h3>
<p>London: The British novelist, Ms. Stokerley, died today in her house in Pethswater Town. Her room was filled with coal gas, suggesting death by poisoning. Ms. Stokerley was born in South Africa and began her career as a journalist in London in 1898. She also appeared on stage for about twelve years. She later lived in America for several years and wrote many novels, the most famous of which is "Plonjoba." (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Withdrawal from Naval Conference: Aggression Against China to Intensify, British Newspapers Observe</h3>
<p>London: This morning, newspapers commented on Japan's withdrawal from the naval conference, considering this move unsurprising. The Daily Express predicts that Japan's withdrawal from the naval conference will mark the day it intensifies its aggression in northern China, adding that "relations between Britain and the United States will become even closer as a result. If so, it may not be a misfortune for the Anglo-Saxon nations." (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>French Cabinet Decides Policy: Supporting the League of Nations and Cooperating with Britain</h3>
<p>If the League of Nations expands the scope of sanctions,</p>
<p>Italy declares it reserves freedom of action</p>
<p>Paris: The policy that France should adopt when the League of Nations' Committee of Eighteen meets on the 20th of this month has been approved by the cabinet today, following a motion by Prime Minister Laval. This policy includes the following three points: Fully supporting the League of Nations regarding the Italian-Ethiopian crisis; Cooperating loyally with Britain; Supporting the League of Nations' mediation efforts. Furthermore, the cabinet meeting today also decided that Laval would depart for Geneva on Sunday or Monday. Therefore, it is generally believed that the left-wing motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies will be postponed. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Rome: Italy may not send a representative to the League of Nations Council meeting on January 20th to discuss the oil embargo. This matter is currently under consideration, and according to responsible sources, no decision has yet been made. At the same time, it is reported that the Italian Ambassador to Paris, Cerutti, declared to French Prime Minister Laval that Italy would not withdraw from the League of Nations even if the League expands sanctions against Italy. This statement has been confirmed by Italian officials, stating that the Italian government now reserves complete freedom of action and has not announced any decisions in advance. Furthermore, the Italian authorities dismissed as nonsense the rumor that Cerutti assured Laval that Italy would not attack the American fleet in the Mediterranean, stating that Italy has never planned any aggressive actions. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Meeting: Discussing the Diplomatic Situation</h3>
<p>London: The British cabinet held its first meeting this morning after Christmas. All cabinet members were present. It is reported that most of the discussions concerned diplomatic matters, with some consideration also given to imperial and domestic affairs. Several more meetings will be held soon to deal with these issues. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>London: It has been learned that the cabinet meeting to be held tomorrow will discuss the diplomatic situation. The instructions for Foreign Secretary Eden's attendance at the League of Nations Council's regular meeting will also be finalized at that time. It is expected that the cabinet will grant Eden discretionary power, instructing him to pay close attention to the potential impact of the embargo measures on the European situation when discussing the oil embargo issue. In addition, it is generally believed that the recent intense propaganda in German newspapers, proposing to reoccupy the demilitarized zone on both banks of the Rhine in response to Anglo-French naval cooperation, has caused considerable anxiety in Britain. Therefore, Britain's view on the Italian-Ethiopian issue is slightly different from before. For example, the oil embargo, previously seen as a means of punishing Italy, is now regarded as a strategy to preserve Italy's strength so that it is no longer depleted in colonial wars. The Cabinet Defense Committee discussed this matter once yesterday. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>British and French Fleets Set Sail, Cruising the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Containing a demonstrative effect towards Italy</p>
<p>London: The British naval spring exercise, which carries the meaning of threatening Italy, including the battleships HMS "Nelson," "Rodney," "Lancaster," "Felis," and the destroyer leaders "Kemel," "Steddy," and the 41st and 42nd destroyer squadrons, departed from Portsmouth Naval Base today as scheduled, sailing towards the Strait of Gibraltar. Part of the main French naval force with a submarine fleet also set out towards the same area on the 16th in advance, patrolling as a demonstration against Italy. (Dentsu dispatch, 14th) The second and fourth destroyer divisions of the French Brest port set sail from here this morning at 10:00, heading to cruise the waters off West Africa. All the warships of the Second Fleet will depart tomorrow. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>East African Rainy Season Arrives, Difficulties for Italian Military Operations</h3>
<p>Adopting a policy of indiscriminate bombing and burning, using gas bombs to blind people</p>
<p>Akin: Recent heavy rains have made it impossible for Italian troops to retreat or advance. According to reports from Ethiopia, the war on both fronts is becoming increasingly difficult. Italian troops have now retreated to long-prepared self-defense lines and fortresses. Ethiopian generals will no longer attack these positions to avoid significant casualties. Military observers believe that the troops between the fortresses will inevitably be forced to surrender sooner or later, as reinforcing troops, transporting supplies, and retreating are all impossible. Roads built by the Italian army near this area are covered with thick mud, unsuitable for troop movement. Recent reports from the southern front indicate that the Italian army has abandoned Agaton and is actively preparing to launch a major offensive towards the province of Galala. Military experts observing this matter believe that the distance from the Italian base of Davé to Akin is 400 miles, with the first 100 miles being desert and the remaining distance being mountains. In the mountains, 160,000 Ethiopian troops are waiting. Therefore, foreign military experts doubt that the Italian army can overcome these natural and military difficulties. In the past two sunny days, Italian aircraft have been very active on both the northern and southern fronts. (National Telegram, 14th) Akin: Ethiopian officials announced today that Italian aircraft dropped many gas bombs, causing those exposed to them to lose their eyesight and suffer extreme pain. Because of the early arrival of the rainy season and muddy positions, the Italians adopted a policy of indiscriminate bombing and burning. It was learned here today that Italian aircraft directly attacked a small church in the northern village of Sagutai, killing ten believers and blinding ten others. The Ethiopian army also retaliated by burning villages and churches as the Italian army retreated. (National Telegram, 14th) Taishi City: In recent days, Italian military aircraft have been relentlessly bombing the area north of the city of Sokota on the northern front of Ethiopia. The intensity has increased since the Italian army withdrew from the area. On the 11th of this month, Sokota city was also bombed. Among the bombs dropped, three were massive gas bombs, and ten did not explode upon landing. The Saint Mary Church in the city immediately caught fire and was completely destroyed. Ten people in the church were buried under the rubble. Sokota is located 100 kilometers south of Magale City. Furthermore, according to Italian prisoners of war transported here from the front, the Italian General Staff has authorized its soldiers to set fire to villages and churches and loot civilian cattle and food in the Tigre Province. However, this is only permitted for native soldiers. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>New Offensive on the Southern Front</h3>
<p>Rome: According to a communique announced today, General Graziani, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces on the southern front, began an offensive on Sunday, occupying positions near the Galari Giglia River and the Dawa Parada River in an attempt to put pressure on the Ethiopian troops stationed in the Duro region towards Jijiga and Harar. These two places are the main objectives of the Italian offensive now decided. Therefore, the current offensive by the Italian forces appears to be driven by mechanized Italian troops and "two divisions" of artillery. If the "two divisions" arrive first, the Italian forces will find it difficult to continue advancing. General Graziani's troops have recently increased from 45,000 to 75,000 in preparation for the new offensive. People here now hope that the troops of General Tesfaye will be defeated, so that Italian columns may advance between the Filbohibili River and the Fanfang River and scout Jijiga and Harar.

<h3>Sweden Lodges Strong Protest with Italy Over Bombing of Aid Team</h3>
<p>Hoping to investigate the issue of responsibility and reserving the right to demand compensation</p>
<p>Swedish Capital: Regarding the bombing of the Swedish Red Cross aid team in the southern city of Doro, Ethiopia, on December 31st of last year by Italian military aircraft, the government yesterday sent a protest note, through its ambassador to Italy, to the Italian government. Foreign Minister Sandt Lou recently made the full text of the protest note public, stating that the Swedish government, after the incident, consulted with both Italy and Ethiopia, as well as with Swedish nationals who witnessed the bombing, to inquire about the circumstances at the time. As a result, the truth has been clarified. "The Swedish government is convinced that the aid team was a direct target of Italian air force aggression, and therefore must lodge a strong protest with the Italian government." Furthermore, General Graziani, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Southern Front, stated in an official note sent to the Swedish government that the Ethiopian side had taken actions that violated the so-called laws of war, and the Italian army had therefore taken retaliatory measures and bombed. "Italy's excuse for attacking the Swedish aid team is insufficient, as Italy claims that the Ethiopian army misused the Red Cross symbol, but has not provided sufficient facts to prove it. The Swedish government now hopes that Italy will promptly investigate the issue of responsibility for the bombing of the aid team and pursue the aggressor air force according to law. The Swedish government also reserves the right to make demands that it deems appropriate to the Italian government after the issue of responsibility is determined." (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-French Military Cooperation: Germans Feel Uneasy</h3>
<p>Berlin: The agreement between Britain and France on mutual assistance in the Mediterranean has aroused much discussion in the local newspapers. They are focusing on this issue without commenting on the impact this agreement may have on the Locarno Treaty. The Nazi Party organ "The Attacker" raises the question: "Does the Anglo-French agreement violate the Locarno Treaty? If so, what is the reason?" British newspapers are now using flattering words to appease Germany, showing that Britain clearly wants to reduce Germany's unease. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>British Trade Surplus</h3>
<p>London: Trade statistics for 1935 were released today, showing that Britain had a trade surplus of 44,000,000 pounds. In 1934, there was a trade deficit of 1,000,000 pounds. The revival of export trade in 1935 was largely due to increased purchases of British goods, especially automobiles and machinery. However, coal and cotton goods declined and were slightly reduced compared to 1934, with cotton goods still affected by Japanese competition in various countries. The imports that increased were food and raw materials. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Rural Life Sketches</h3>
<p>— Edited by Yu Zhutang</p>
<p>Life in a Rural Village that Has Stalled: You Weizu</p>
<p>The giant wheels of the era are constantly turning, and everything is moving forward with the times. However, the living conditions of tenant farmers in my hometown remain the same as those I heard and saw in my childhood, and even the same as those of my father and grandfather in their youth. Is this "still the same" old rural village a Peach Blossom Spring unaware of the Jin Dynasty? Or is it a land full of thorns? Please see the following description to see what kind of life they are living.</p>
<p>My hometown is a rural village in the northeast of Taixian County, Jiangsu. Although it is remotely located north of the Yangtze River, it only takes two days to reach the capital, the political center, and Shanghai, the commercial center. In terms of transportation, it cannot be said to be completely closed off. In recent years, quite a few sons of landlords in the countryside have taken the peasants' wealth to the cities to exchange for bachelor's caps. On the surface, it cannot be said that the culture is very backward. However, after examining the lives of most tenant farmers, one cannot help but "cry and laugh."</p>
<p>The Suffering of Tenant Farmers: Ordinary tenant farmers are often oppressed, but the tenant farmers in my hometown, in addition to being subjected to ordinary oppression, also suffer from the exploitation of the land stewards who bully others by flaunting their connections with the powerful. The land steward is an employee hired by the large landowners in my hometown to specialize in land affairs. The landlord entrusts all powers such as collecting rent and summoning tenants to him. Therefore, the poor tenant farmers endure many harsh demands from the land stewards. The land stewards, who receive the landlord's salary, also demand that tenant farmers pay eight cents per mu per year for food. The few fat chickens that tenant farmers raise to supplement their income must also be offered two each year, called "New Year chickens," which are all clearly stated in the lease. In addition to this, there is also a kind of "tacit" exploitation. When he presides over the rent collection, he has another set of "heaven knows" large scales and giant dippers. The poor farmers can only continue to add the grain they earned with sweat and tears to the scales under his shouting, not daring to hesitate.</p>
<p>The Arrogance of Beggars: In addition to not daring to speak out against the exploitation of the land stewards, they are also afraid of strong, vicious beggars - it can be said that they are paupers - and dare not resist, truly acting like filial sons and virtuous grandsons, responding to every request. Because if they slightly displease them, they will surely suffer the disaster of "the walls being painted red" in the shortest possible time. In order to protect their thatched huts, which are easily subjected to malicious destruction, and the straw stacks harvested from the fields, they have no choice but to allow the vicious ones to openly threaten them with "arson" and endure it in every possible way. Although the nearby towns have public security organs, they are more concerned with protecting the gentry and have no time to pay attention to these farmers in the "uncivilized" countryside.</p>
<p>Eating Tea and Discussing Justice Costs Money: There are many disputes among the poor, and they often argue over trivial matters, involving a large number of relatives and friends. In a situation where "each person has their own reasons," the result is that they mobilize the masses and run to the towns to eat tea and discuss justice. At this time, there are always some "experts" who are stationed there year-round and rely on judging cases for a living. Without waiting for an application, they will come forward and use their glib tongues to reverse right and wrong and speak eloquently. The angry parties listen to their judgments under the condition that money is justice. As a result, both parties waste a lot of money, and in addition to the tea house making a small profit, the white-collar adjudicators have another opportunity to make money.</p>
<p>Labor Has No Value: The saying "half a year of hard work, half a year of leisure" contains a lot of meaning in praising and envying farmers. But who knows? The poor farmers don't get three meals a day during this "half a year of leisure." After the autumn harvest, everyone has strength but nowhere to sell it. Fearing that they will be eating away at their savings, they have no choice but to reduce three meals to two meals, and dry rice becomes thin porridge. At this time, regardless of men, women, old, or young, as long as they can get enough to eat for one day, they can sell a day's labor without taking a penny in return. If someone hires them to get through the rest of the winter and the New Year, in addition to not wanting wages, they will also be endlessly grateful to you.</p>
<p>Clothing Comes from Eggs: When they marry a daughter-in-law, they give her a hen to raise. From then on, the source of their clothing relies on the eggs laid by this hen. Under the market conditions of low egg prices and copper coins in circulation, they must collect at least sixty or seventy eggs to exchange for one silver dollar, and at most they can only add one set of clothes. If they also have children, how can they make ends meet? Therefore, they have no choice but to wear clothes full of patches. It is not that they are different from ordinary women who love beauty, but that they really have their own difficulties. I remember a peasant woman crying "as if mourning her parents" because her chickens had died from a plague. Others laughed at her for being foolish, but the people who laughed did not think about the sadness of losing the source of her clothing.</p>
<p>Savings-Style Marriage: Under the traditional concept of "having sons early and seeing grandsons early," their savings-style marriage may not be a clever way for them to solve the marriage problem. The so-called savings-style marriage is that they arrange a marriage for their children when they are young, and all the betrothal gifts are paid in installments like savings, so that they don't have to withdraw a large sum at the time of marriage. This is indeed a way for them to solve the marriage problem, but under this trading-style system, "insufficient clothing and food" small citizens are naturally produced. In the eyes of sociologists, this is considered to be an intractable population problem.</p>
<p>Opening the Door Only Leads to Two Things: "Firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, tea" are the seven things for opening the door, which explains the basic daily expenses of each family. However, they cannot talk about "five flavors harmonizing a hundred flavors," so they never think about asking about the three things of "oil, sauce, and vinegar." Logically speaking, the three most basic things of "firewood, rice, and salt" cannot be lacking. However, the price of salt is so expensive that it costs 460 texts per catty, and the salt vendors also rely on monopolies to secretly reduce the weight. In salt stores, one catty can buy sixteen liang, while in salt vendors, it is discounted by at least 20%. Wealthy gentlemen can buy ten thousand catties at distant salt stores, while poor farmers only buy half a catty or eight liang at a time, and they can only suffer multiple layers of explicit and implicit exploitation. Because they cannot withstand such losses, they have no choice but to sigh at the salt. Knowing that they cannot swallow without salt, they have no choice but to abstain from salt temporarily under unavoidable restrictions. Therefore, their daily diet only has the two most indispensable things: "firewood and rice." No wonder when they see families discarding stinky pickled vegetables and sauce dregs, they consider them unclean and often get sick. Perhaps this is God's compassion and a specially opened door of convenience.</p>
<p>The Lingering Influence of Private Schools: In each farming family, they will always send one of their children to study at a private school. It is not that he hopes that his son will "jump the dragon gate and pass the imperial examination," nor is it that he wants to keep a seed of learning at home to enlighten the family's culture. His role is to take this opportunity to form a relationship with the village school teacher, so that it is easier to ask him for help in all matters, in addition to writing account books and couplets being the school teacher's duty. If there are weddings and funerals, the school teacher is still the obvious consultant. A school teacher, in addition to teaching, must also have knowledge of astrology, medicine, and divination. Even if Zhuge Liang were reborn, he would have to politely decline. However, in order to preserve his livelihood, the school teacher can only muddle through and pretend to know what he doesn't know. Therefore, jokes are often discovered in my hometown. Because the school teacher has many miscellaneous tasks and too many part-time jobs, he has to greatly discount the homework of his students, working hard for a short time and then neglecting it for a long time. Fortunately, the family's intention is not in the books. Even if they have been in private school for three years and are illiterate, no one will blame them. Although the order to ban bad private schools has been transmitted to the countryside, the teachers in the schools cannot suit their tastes, so the lingering influence of private schools is still present today.</p>
<p>The situation above is not only the case in the rural villages of one county in my hometown. I am afraid that the rural villages in Jiangsu or the entire China are largely the same. They are now living in the mystery of "not knowing how to get to this point." Although they seem to be quietly enduring it there now, it is like a bomb buried deep there without encountering a fuse. Therefore, I hope that the officials in power will strive to find ways to provide relief and improvement, and do not forget the power that actually helps the countryside - farmer education.</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Headquarters Decides to Reorganize Troops Stationed in North China</h3>
<p>And Strengthen On-the-Spot Combat Capabilities</p>
<p>Chief Staff Officer Sugiyama to Inspect China</p>
<p>Tokyo: After Lieutenant Colonel Muto of the Japanese Army Ministry's Military Affairs Section returned to Japan after inspecting the actual situation in North China and Manchuria, he made a detailed report to the Japanese General Staff Headquarters and the Army's senior leadership. Given the complexity of the situation in North China, the two departments decided to reorganize the Japanese troops stationed in North China and strengthen their preparedness for on-the-spot combat at any time. They will start with the reform of officers and decided to reorganize and strengthen them according to the following principles: Reorganize the Troops Stationed in North China: The first priority is to strengthen the equipment of the stationed troops so that their necessary number and strength exceed that of the troops stationed by Britain, France, and the United States, in order to prevent the free action of the Japanese army from being hit when international relations deteriorate. The central military department will solve this urgently and reorganize the Japanese troops stationed in China. Substantial Reinforcement of the Kwantung Army: Due to the tension in relations with the Soviet Union and Mongolia, the strength of the Kwantung Army still needs to be actively strengthened. At the same time, the current rotation system for garrisoning troops will be reformed into a permanent garrison system, using the fundamental national policy as a criterion for deciding to strengthen it. The headquarters of the troops stationed in North China will be expanded with the headquarters of the Taiwan Army as a standard. (Hualian dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Lieutenant General Sugiyama Moto, Chief of the General Staff, is scheduled to depart from Tokyo in early February and go on a business trip to North China and "Manchukuo" with a scheduled visit of one month. This trip is to inspect the local area and coordinate with the military units stationed abroad. However, from the following two matters, namely: Increasing the number of troops in Manchuria and North China, which has been confirmed to be absolutely necessary; The Soviet Union, due to the success of the second five-year plan and the establishment of close ties with a certain country, has suddenly hardened its attitude towards foreign countries, and Japan needs to re-determine the attitude it should take in response, it can be seen that not only the fundamental matters related to command must be discussed with the military units stationed abroad, but there must also be a considerable degree of decision-making. Therefore, Chief Staff Officer Sugiyama's visit to North China and Manchuria is extremely important. (Dentsu dispatch, 15th)</p>

According to Bao, this trip to Pangjiang was to report to Prince De on the progress of the negotiations on the Chahar issue in Peiping and to ask the Mongolian Political Council for instructions on future policies. Regarding the Chahar incident, we are currently waiting for Chairman Song and Mayor Xiao to negotiate. Prince De's mother is ill but has now recovered. Prince Yun was recently elected as a member of the National Government and has agreed to take office and has telegraphed the Central Government to express his thanks.

<p>Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, went to Tianjin on the afternoon of the 14th.

The day before Song went to Tianjin, Song was also invited to attend a banquet hosted by Imai, the military attaché of the Japanese embassy, for Itagaki. During the banquet, there was some discussion on the current negotiation issues. However, the formal negotiation location is still in Tianjin. It is generally expected that the Tianjin Sino-Japanese dignitaries' meeting will first resolve the Eastern Hebei issue in the current situation in North China, and finally resolve the Chahar issue.</p>
<p>Chahar is close to Suiyuan. The activities of the puppet army Li Shouxin's troops have had a significant impact on eastern Suiyuan. Recently, the Suiyuan authorities have actively deployed defenses and have gathered a strong military force. Zeng Yanyi, brigade commander of the 218th Brigade of the 73rd Division of Fu Zuoyi's troops, has led his troops to Jining to garrison. The 431st Regiment of the 73rd Division of Dong Qiwu's troops, originally stationed in Fengzhen, has also moved entirely to Xinghe and its vicinity to garrison. The defense of Fengzhen is filled by the Li Brigade of Li Fuying's troops of the 69th Division. The Li Brigade has now dispatched one regiment.

The attitude of the authorities of the four Right Wing Banners is very clear, and they are determined to support the central government. (14th)</p>
<h3>Jinan Banking and Qian Shops Provide Loan Relief to Commerce</h3>
<p>The amount is set at 1.5 million yuan</p>
<p>Loan committee set up to start lending Jinan Communication: The city's commerce has been sluggish for years, and this year, due to the unstable situation, banks have tightened credit, refusing to issue new loans and intensifying collection of old loans, making it difficult for various businesses to turn over funds. The merchants are afraid that without relief measures, half of them will go bankrupt by the end of the year. At the request of the municipal chamber of commerce, the Department of Finance persuaded the banking and qian shop industries to lend money, the amount of which was set at 1.5 million yuan, and a loan committee was organized to provide relief. Regarding the loan methods, the previously drafted plan was divided into three types: 1. Ordinary loans, with goods as collateral, limited to 20,000 yuan; 2. Credit loans, with two shopkeepers as guarantors, limited to 500 yuan; 3. Special loans, with goods as collateral and real estate as guarantee, limited to 10,000 yuan. However, after the banks telegraphed their respective head offices for instructions, it has been three or four days, and no reply has been received as of yesterday. The banks, considering that the end of the year is approaching and the business community urgently needs funds, plan to start lending within a few days to alleviate the immediate need. The loan committee jointly formed by the banking and qian shop industries is scheduled to be established tomorrow (the 15th). The Central Bank of China, the China Bank of Communications, the Minsheng Bank, and the Four Banks will each contribute 250,000 yuan, and the Qian Shop Association will contribute 100,000 yuan, and this 1.1 million yuan will be lent out first. If it is still not enough, the Continental Bank, the Industrial Bank, the Shanghai Bank, and the Donglai Bank will each contribute another 100,000 yuan for continued lending. The Chamber of Commerce will also organize a loan review committee within a few days. Anyone who needs funds must first register with the review committee, and if the review is deemed qualified, the loan committee will be notified to lend the money. With this relief, the business community in this city can be expected to safely overcome the difficulties. In addition, there is a lack of copper coins in the market, which makes it difficult to make change in market transactions. The Ping City Official Qian Bureau printed 1 million yuan of copper coin notes at the official printing bureau to provide relief, including 100,000 yuan for ten-coin notes, 100,000 yuan for twenty-coin notes, and 400,000 yuan each for fifty-coin and one-hundred-coin notes, totaling 1.35 million yuan. It is reported that a batch has already been printed and is being printed with signatures and numbers. It is hoped that it will be issued before the end of the year, first circulated in Jinan City, and then promoted to various counties. In addition to announcing a ban on hoarding copper coins, Wang Xiangrong, director of the Department of Finance, yesterday sent Section Chief Wang Zao Lin to summon Li Bocheng, chairman of the Jinan Municipal Chamber of Commerce, to the department and instructed him to inform all guilds to inform all merchants and people in the city not to hide copper coins, so as not to cause inconvenience. Li Bocheng convened all guilds at 2:00 PM to inform all merchants and people in the city and ordered them to report the number of copper coins in each household. Today, Li Bocheng has reported the handling situation to the Department of Finance.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province: Extreme Financial Panic</h3>
<p>Various Firms Experience Turnover Difficulties, Facing Closures</p>
<p>Small Business Owners Petition for a Four-Month Extension on Account Settlement</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: The overall economic decline in Jiangxi Province has led to unprecedented panic and urgency. In rural areas, there is widespread hunger and cold, and people cannot survive. In urban areas, all industries are declining, and closures are increasing daily. The Jiangxi Department of Finance, in the face of the economic crisis in Nanchang City, in addition to issuing emergency measures to curb closures, also borrowed 2 million yuan from the Central Bank of China, the China Bank of Communications, and the Three Banks for loan relief. However, with the disease having penetrated the marrow, it is difficult to revive. With the end of the year approaching, most shops are in great fear. Yesterday, four more companies announced their closure due to turnover difficulties. Wanlong Silk and Foreign Goods Store, which has been open on Zhongshan Road for more than ten years, had 60,000 to 70,000 yuan worth of goods and decorations at the time of its closure, and owed 70,000 to 80,000 yuan in loans from other businesses and money shops. Yihexiang Cloth Store, located on Guohuo Road, had a solid foundation in the past. This year, due to excessive purchases of real estate, it was unable to repay the money shop loans at the end of the year and announced its closure, owing more than 30,000 yuan, which can be offset by real estate. However, the manager, Yang Shaoqiu, was escorted to the Public Security Bureau for detention because the property could not be converted into cash. Xingfu Silk Factory, a branch of a Hangzhou company, announced its closure due to sluggish business and excessive expenses. Yichenghao, a foreign goods business in Ximachi, announced its closure due to losses. In addition, Chenguang Bookstore and others have also announced liquidation, or have been mediated by the Chamber of Commerce, or have met in court, or have been subject to emergency disposal by the Provincial Government, and so on. (11th)</p>
<p>The Commercial Relief Association, composed of small and medium-sized merchants, and the various industries of domestic cloth, piece goods, noodles, rice shops, inns, rice, paper, and bamboo and wood, yesterday again petitioned the Department of Finance on a large scale: 1. Allow small and medium-sized merchants to mortgage real estate and goods for cash, and allow mortgage of port and decoration items to facilitate widespread adoption; 2. Allow the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to jointly lead the Commercial Relief Association to borrow loans from the Department of Finance and the Three Banks and then lend them to small and medium-sized merchants; 3. If there is no way to obtain loans, allow a four-month extension of settlement, as in the case of Shanghai in the Republic of China year 22. Wu, the section chief of the Department of Finance, replied that real estate mortgages are being handled by the Yumin Bank, the second item is not easy to handle, and the third item will be submitted to the Provincial Government for approval.</p>
<p>Songjiang: The funds for the 12th Brigade of the Provincial Security Forces in this county are collected from the county's land tax, with five cents per mu allocated for security expenses, which has been approved. Based on the total acreage of the county, over 10,000 yuan should be collected. However, the security team's annual expenditure is around 30,000 yuan, which is due to the unified planning and budgeting. However, the county is vast, and the troops under the brigade are not enough to allocate for garrisoning. Often, if they are stationed in Punan, they cannot take care of Pubei, causing complaints from the people of Pubei. Due to the large number of theft cases in Pubei, it is necessary to supplement the strength of the security team. If the collected security funds are fully allocated to budgeting, the expenses borne by the people will be used for the defense and pacification of the entire county, allowing the people to live and work in peace. This is the wish of the people. It is learned that as the 25th year budget is about to be prepared, the brigade will, in accordance with the public opinion of the local people, request the county government to allocate all security funds to the brigade for expansion in order to maintain local security.</p>
<p>Suzhou: The fact that the Wuxian water and land police teams set off in the snow for Lake Tai and Manshan to suppress bandits has already been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the bandit suppression police team searched for bandit traces in the Xitai Lake area on the 15th. It is heard that the lake bandits have fled to the Da Lei Mountain area in Zhejiang Province. The Zhejiang water police stationed in Weixing, Zhejiang, will meet with the water police stationed in Yixing and Wu of Jiangsu Province in Da Lei Mountain within a few days to clear the source of the bandits. Zhou Rang, the trial officer of Jiangyin, was accused of accepting bribes and dereliction of duty. The High Court ordered Zhou's dismissal and sent him to the Xiwu Court for investigation. Shi Wending, the lawyer involved, has also been detained. Chen Yipeng, Yuan Quanmei, Wang Mansheng, Chen Fengxiang, Wang Junyi and other five people who were the fuse of this case were also escorted from Cheng to Xiwu on the 10th of this month for investigation. On the 14th, another court session was held. The parties and witnesses Wang Jiajun, Zhu Gensheng, Huang Shaoying, Sha Jun, Liu Guiquan, Su Quanchun, Zhang Xushi, Hua Xianzhang, Hui Huangshi, and other nine people were summoned by Prosecutor Shen. The hearing began at 10:00 AM and ended at 8:00 PM. Huang Shaoying was ordered to be detained, and Chen Yipeng and others were sent back to prison. Wang Jiajun, Liu Guiquan and others were all ordered to return home. Yesterday (15th) morning at 9:00 AM, Prosecutor Shen continued to hold a court session to interrogate the relevant parties.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>The Workers' Union Inspects Cloth Factories' Products</p>
<p>The Wuyi Industrial Union believes that cotton cloth is a major product of the county. Recently, a small number of cloth factories have often mixed inferior quality cloth into their products, making it difficult to sell in other counties, which has a significant impact on the future of the business. According to yesterday's news, the union has organized a cotton cloth inspection committee to inspect the products of each member factory on a monthly basis. Jiang Shangda, Xie Chengchang, Liu Guojun, Zhu Yongsheng, Tang Dingan, Jiang Panfa and other six people were elected as directors, and Shen Changsheng and other six people were elected as inspectors. The inspection procedures are as follows: five days before the monthly meeting of this month, 20 pieces of cloth will be collected from each member factory and submitted to the union for inspection. After the inspectors submit the inspection results, the Board of Directors will review them and notify the member factory and return the cloth. The Nantong district includes Tong, Ru, Hai, Chongqi, Qijing, and other counties. Recently,</p>
<p>The Opium Addicts' Vocational Training Factory is Expanded</p>
<p>The Nantong district, which includes Tong, Ru, Hai, Chongqi, and Jing, and other counties, has recently seen a surge in opium offenders, and prisons are full. The county chiefs met in the commissioner's office to discuss relief measures and decided to expand the vocational training factory for opium addicts. The commissioner's office has submitted a report to the province for approval to accommodate opium addicts who have been convicted of addiction and to provide them with vocational training. The provincial government has approved it, and the director of the factory, Chen Liyin, is formulating a plan.</p>
<p>Military and Police Organize Guerrilla Teams</p>
<p>The Tongyi military and police forces have jointly organized a guerrilla team to prevent bandit disturbances. Wu Yongqing is the captain. The entire county is divided into three major districts, and the union has joined with township and baojia leaders to suppress bandits.</p>
<p>Jiashan: In Henimiao area of the county, there lived Yang Rongfang from Xiaoshan, a carpenter by trade, married to a Yang woman, with one son and one daughter, the elder already five years old, and the younger still in swaddling clothes. Last night, fire broke out, Rongfang was working outside and had not returned. Neighbors noticed, and the fire was already raging. The Yang woman was dragged out by others, but her head was already burnt. The two children died in the fire. All the houses were reduced to ashes. The Yang wife is feared to be in danger of losing her life. Rongfang rushed back after receiving the news, and wept bitterly at the sight. Those who heard it were saddened.</p>
<p>Murder for Money Case Near Xitang</p>
<p>In a dilapidated house in Shanjia Village near Xitang, there lived an old woman surnamed Xu, aged 73, who was thrifty and had accumulated more than one hundred yuan in hard currency. However, she was detected by thieves, who broke into the house over the wall on the night of the 12th and hacked the old woman to death. Blood splattered on all four walls, and the scene was quite tragic. The next day, the village chief, Gu Dian, reported the situation to the county. The county court sent an official to the village for inspection.</p>
<p>Jiaxing: Inducing Farmers to Riot over Grain Collection</p>
<p>The Jiantunjiao Township Office in Wangjiangjing District, Jiaxing, was ordered to collect grain. Therefore, the staff member of the district township joint office, Sun Peng, and the police chief of the third branch of the Public Security Bureau went to the Zhongrenbang and Beirenbang areas of Jiantunjiao the day before yesterday to collect grain. When they collected grain from Chen Fengyou, a farmer from Shaoxing, a Yong man, Li Aying, came forward to obstruct, claiming that the money had already been collected in the grain tax. The two sides clashed over words, and more than 20 farmers, including Cao Xiaowu Nv, Shi Xiaochuan, and Li Chunbao, gathered and surrounded Sun, dragging him into the paddy field and taking away the collected grain worth more than 30 yuan, along with a gold ring. Later, the staff member ran back to report to the Public Security Bureau, and Director Lin led the police to investigate and arrest, but the rioters had all fled and disappeared. The situation has been reported to the authorities for approval.</p>

<p>Yang Maifu, the Jia Wei of the 14th Jia of the 10th Bao of Xinping Township in the seventh district of Huxi County (i.e., Yangjia Dazhuang), has a modest family fortune. Suddenly, at about 2:00 AM last night, eight bandits came with guns and other weapons, broke into the house, and woke up the family members. They searched everywhere and robbed jewelry and clothes. Still not satisfied, they kidnapped Yang's twelve-year-old son (named Xiao Guanzi). The loss was about 200 yuan. The Seventh District Office has submitted a report to the county government to request the arrest of the bandits and rescue the hostage.</p>

<p>Four Children Die in a Fire</p>
<p>Chen Zhanao, a resident east of the Gutaiwang Temple outside the North Gate, was detained by the county government after being reported by his Bao Zhang, Yan Wanshun, for smoking opium. Chen's wife and her four children stayed at home. This morning (13th), Chen's wife went to the Peihui porridge factory to collect porridge, leaving her four children at home to guard the door. For some unknown reason, a fire broke out, destroying the hall. Fortunately, the east and west wing rooms and the south room were not affected. However, Chen's wife did not return home when the fire broke out. After the fire was extinguished, three burned boys and one burned girl were found after excavation, the older ones were more than ten years old, and the younger ones were less than one year old. The situation was extremely tragic, making it unbearable to see.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>Heavy Snow in the City Affects Traffic</p>
<p>Since 3:00 PM on the 13th, due to the severe cold weather in Hangzhou, the temperature dropped to 34 degrees, and snowflakes flew in the sky. The snow continued to fall on the 14th until 3:00 AM this morning (15th). The snow accumulation around the West Lake was more than a foot deep, and the streets were several inches thick, making travel extremely difficult. In terms of transportation, the Shanghai-Hangzhou and long-distance telephone lines to various counties were completely cut off. As of this afternoon, the repaired telephone lines were to Shanghai, Jiaxing, Haining, Deqing, and Lanxi. The snow on the roads such as Jinghang, Shanghai-Hangzhou, Hanghui, and Hangjian was about a foot deep. Although traffic was not blocked, the arrival and departure times of each bus were inevitably delayed.

<p>Customs Patrol Ship Kills Fisherman. Liu Renyong from Dinghai Likang made a living by fishing and owned a drifting net ship, hiring seven villagers including Lou Ahe as partners. Liu had caught a lot of fish in recent days, so at about 9:00 AM on the 13th, he loaded the fish onto a boat and sold it to Fengji Fish Shop in Zhoushan. At about 10:00 AM, he drove the original ship away from Zhoushan, planning to return to Likang. When he sailed to the waters of Zhushan Weir, a Yunxing No. 25 patrol ship of the Jianghai Customs happened to be patrolling for smuggled goods. The Westerners in the ship saw Liu's ship and took a small motorboat to inquire. When the two ships were fifty or sixty feet apart, Liu's ship knew that it had to be inspected. Lou Ahe climbed onto the wooden shed and lowered the sail in order to stop the ship for inspection. Unexpectedly, the Westerners misunderstood and shot at Liu's ship with rifles, causing Lou Ahe to be seriously injured in the right waist and right arm. At about 1:00 PM, the ship carried Lou to Ningbo for medical treatment, but he died at about 6:00 PM. The patrol ship returned to the sea to patrol after sending Lou to Ningbo.</p>

<h3>Historical Lecture Series - Part 1</h3>
<p>The Goal of National History Education in Primary and Secondary Schools</p>
<p>By Zheng Hesheng, Full-time Editor and Compiler at the National Institute for Compilation and Translation</p>
<p>Esteemed listeners, the topic I will be discussing today is "The Goal of National History Education in Primary and Secondary Schools." In our country, history has always been considered an independent discipline. This is because our scholars have traditionally regarded the study of the classics as the core of all learning, and historical materials are mostly inseparable from classical texts. Reading history was merely considered a footnote to studying the classics. It was not until the late Qing Dynasty, when we began to emulate the educational systems of Western countries, that history became an independent subject. In the 29th year of the Guangxu reign (1903), the Qing government promulgated the Revised Regulations for Schools, which established history as a subject from theological schools to elementary schools. The goal of teaching national history in elementary schools was generally to briefly mention the major and beautiful deeds of ancient sage rulers and wise monarchs, to make students aware of the origins of Chinese culture and the virtuous governance of the current dynasty, in order to cultivate the foundations of loyalty and love for the nation; it also advocated first teaching local history, selecting admirable and inspiring deeds of local worthies, famous officials, and notable temporary residents within the region to explain and inspire students’ aspirations for virtuousness and sagehood. In higher elementary schools, the focus was on presenting an overview of the rise and fall of dynasties since the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun, to make students aware of the changes in the world throughout history; emphasis was placed on the politics of the current dynasty, to make students aware of the profound kindness of the current monarch, to cultivate the nation's spirit of self-improvement, and to generate feelings of loyalty and love. In middle schools, it was advocated to first teach national history, focusing on the major events of past emperors, presenting the virtuous governance and kindness of the current monarch; and major events within the past hundred years of the country, specifically discussing the deeds of loyal and virtuous sages of ancient and modern times, as well as the prosperity of academics and arts, the development of martial arts, the evolution of politics, the progress of agriculture, industry, and commerce, and changes in customs, etc. Those who teach history should pay attention to revealing the relationships between real events, clarifying the origins of culture, and enabling students to understand the principles of strength, weakness, rise, and fall, in order to invigorate the nation's spirit.</p>
<p>Since the reform of the political system, the situation has changed considerably. In the fifth year of the Republic (1916), the government stipulated that higher elementary schools should briefly teach the meritorious achievements of the Yellow Emperor in founding the country, the words and deeds of great men throughout history, the origins of the Asian cultural system of governance, and the relations between China and foreign countries in the past hundred years. The main purpose was to enable children to understand the general principles of the national system and to cultivate national character. In middle schools, the focus was on teaching the evolving phenomena of politics and culture throughout history and their important events. The purpose was to enable students to understand important historical events, to understand the evolution of humanity, the changes in society, and the rise and fall of nations; attention should be paid to the reforms in politics and the origins of the establishment of the nation.</p>
<p>Since the National Revolution, the situation has changed again. In the 21st year of the Republic (1932), the National Government promulgated curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools. In primary schools, history was included in the social studies subject, allowing children to explore, compare, record, and present information about the lives of people in ancient and modern times that they encounter in their environment and can imagine, ancient and modern cultural artifacts and systems, major historical events in ancient and modern times, commemorative days, the history of national humiliation, the history of national movements, and current events. This would enable children to understand the historical evolution of the nation and cultivate their spirit of loving the country and striving for self-defense. The teaching objectives for junior high schools are as follows: To study the evolution of national history; to specifically explain its historical glories, as well as the process and reasons for the aggression of the great powers in modern times, in order to stimulate students' thinking about national revival and to cultivate their spirit of self-confidence, self-awareness, and promotion. To narrate the overview of the evolution of national culture, with special attention to its contribution to world culture, so that students understand the great deeds of our ancestors, in order to cultivate noble aspirations and a spirit of continuous self-improvement. To narrate the changes in culture in each era, with special attention to the origins of modern political systems and economic conditions, in order to establish students' belief in the Three Principles of the People. In senior high schools, in addition to continuing the objectives stipulated in junior high schools, special attention should be paid to the following points: To narrate the expansion of our nation, and the changes in history, culture, politics, and society, in order to explain the origins of the current state of the country, and to elaborate on the historical basis of the Three Principles of the People; To emphasize the process of diplomatic failures in modern times, and the origins of political and economic problems, in order to explain the background of the national revolution in our country, and to indicate the efforts that our nation should make in the future; To give special attention to past political and economic problems that have an impact on modern society, so that students can gain inspiration from historical facts to study modern problems and cultivate their ability to observe and judge.</p>
<p>Based on the above goals of history education, we should pay attention to the following points regarding the goal of national history education in primary and secondary schools:</p>
<p>We should promote the national spirit and the establishment of the nation; we should pay attention to the promotion of nationalism. We must advocate nationalism, and we must regard the narration of history as its driving force. Since the eighteenth century, Prussia, in order to build a unified country, had the emergence of the Prussian school of historiography. The purpose of this school of historiography was to promote the national spirit of Prussia. At that time, historians such as Treitschke's Prussian Political History and Sybel's Foundations of the German Empire were all aimed at promoting the spirit of the Prussian nation. Treitschke's 19th Century German History further expanded Pan-Germanism and advocated that Prussia should be the leader of the German nation, which Germany relied on to achieve unification. At the same time, the patriots of the Italian states, in an attempt to unify the country, also greatly displayed the nationalist colors in the field of historiography. Historians such as Balbo and Reuchlin not only directly participated in the independence movement and shed their blood, but also wrote historical works and widely publicized them to promote the Italian independence and nation-building movement.</p>
<p>Premier Sun once said, "We, in view of the course of national life in ancient and modern times, want to save China and want the Chinese nation to exist forever, we must advocate nationalism. If we do not pay attention to advocating nationalism and unite 400 million people into a solid nation, China will have the worry of national subjugation and racial extinction. We want to save this danger, so we must advocate nationalism and use the national spirit to save the country." Premier Sun's instructions were very thorough. In recent years, the education authorities have clearly implemented nationalistic education, and the mission undertaken by history education is the most important. Although the goals of history education are many, promoting the national spirit to stimulate its collective emotions, strengthen its ability to be confident, and thereby arouse its concept of cherishing the race as the foundation for revitalizing the nation is indeed the effort that our country should make during the current period of national crisis. The path to this effort is that, in the negative aspect, we should harmonize the feelings of all ethnic groups; in the positive aspect, we should establish a central culture.</p>
<p>Our nation has been assimilated for a long time and has no so-called racial boundaries. Since the late Qing Dynasty, there have been so-called terms such as Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the name of the five races was used. Later, in history textbooks, the five races were listed side by side, or the Miao race was added to become six races, or the Korean race was added to become seven races, and some even added the Yue race to become eight races, and they also described their respective regions and their individual systems. Although the scope included was different, the resulting abuses formed a confrontational phenomenon, creating a tendency to split. Premier Sun believed that if we want to implement nationalism, we often use the United States as a model. All ethnic groups in the country must be treated equally. Before equal treatment, we must do some harmonization work, that is, abandon the name of the Han nationality and create another national name called "Chinese nation." If we are afraid that the Manchus and Mongols will suspect Rong's annexation, we must treat them equally. We should follow this principle to engage in the improvement of history education, that is, take the Three Principles of the People as the center of its cultural creation. History textbooks focus on the deeds, words, and actions of the sages of all ethnic groups, and study the level of their culture and living conditions as materials for mutual integration and improvement.</p>
<p>In addition to having the three elements of territory, people, and sovereignty, the establishment of a country also requires a strong political organization. The cultivation of this national concept also uses history education as its main tool. In the early 19th century, European countries had already used history education as a subject to promote patriotism, focusing on the teaching of their national history. For example, Professor Ritter of the University of Prussia said: "National history should be taught in all our schools. It (referring to national history) should also have a place in our universities; patriots should often mention it. Our purpose is to cultivate a spirit of love and respect for the current system. We should not entrust any public affairs to people who do not understand national history." At the same time, the historian Grote also has the argument that national history should occupy the first position. The German History of the Common School compiled by Carl Claus first talked about the failure of Germany's conflict with Napoleon, and then talked about victory, which can greatly inspire the spirit of the readers. This book was immediately welcomed after its publication in 1816 (the 21st year of Jiaqing), and became a model for many elementary and higher history textbooks. During the Napoleonic era in France, there was also a kind of historical lecture for ordinary citizens. The catechism textbook published in 1806 (the 11th year of Jiaqing) listed the obligations of Christians to their monarchs, with the protection of the country as a prerequisite, and there was also the question of "Do we have any special intentions to make us particularly loyal to our Emperor Napoleon I?" In fact, patriotism became the main purpose of teaching history in schools. After the mid-19th century, the influence of this spirit became more significant. The regulations for the history curriculum of primary schools were almost all national history.</p>
<p>Before the Meiji Restoration in Japan, the shogunate held the power, and the feudal system had not yet been eliminated. Therefore, Tokugawa Mitsukuni wrote the Great History of Japan, advocating the respect for the emperor and the expulsion of foreigners, loyalty to the monarch and love for the country. The masses echoed each other, and as a result, the "theory of overthrowing the shogunate" became popular throughout the country. Asami Keisai wrote Yasukuni Igen, which detailed the deeds of ancient Chinese martyrs to inspire the patriotic spirit of the people. Yamagata Daini, Tozan Yo and other celebrities also responded to it. Therefore, the atmosphere of overthrowing the shogunate became more and more rampant. After the shogunate was overthrown, the restoration situation was able to succeed. Japanese historians have always been proud of calling themselves descendants of Wu Taibo or Xu Fu. Later, they liked to talk about the national essence, which were all cut and not written. The Ministry of Education often ordered Naka Michiyo and others to compile Japanese history and rewrite East Asian history to enhance the people's sense of self-esteem and self-confidence. Therefore, after the Russo-Japanese War, there was the argument that "the strength of Japan is due to the help of Japanese history." (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The City's National Products Year Sports Meet Issued a Proclamation to the Citizens Yesterday: All People United as One, Using Only National Products; Bidding Farewell to Poverty and Creating Wealth, Therein Lies the Path to Survival</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal National Products Year National Products Sports Meet issued a proclamation to the citizens yesterday, which reads: "To the 3.5 million elders, brothers, sisters, and sisters of Shanghai: Our country is poor and weak, which is undeniable. The only reason for our poverty is the competition to use foreign goods. Foreigners have carried out large-scale dumping, taking away the good money of our country's resources, which are like the blood vessels attached to the body, causing us to accumulate poverty and become weak, and we cannot rise up. If we do not want to save ourselves and want our descendants or even ourselves to be trapped in the position of a slave of a subjugated country, then so be it. If our conscience is not dead and we still want to save ourselves from the brink of death, please start by loving and using national products. We must know that before the opening of the sea ban, our country's people were not short of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Mencius said, 'One person's needs are prepared by a hundred craftsmen.' Zhu Bailu said, 'Half a thread or half a strand, always remember that material resources are difficult.' Now, we are abandoning our good national products and must live a foreignized life, so that foreigners can sit back and enjoy the blood and sweat money of our compatriots. Those who have a foreign slave mentality do not hesitate to throw it away, while those who have a heart cannot help but cry bitterly and regard them as public enemies. This association does not mind being verbose and painstaking in its exhortations. We ask our teachers to lead by example, merchants not to be unscrupulous merchants, women to lead the family, and students to persuade their fathers and brothers to do their best to unite the people, use only national products, bid farewell to poverty and create wealth, and there is the path to survival. We do not hesitate to be hoarse and thirsty, but only to bring back life from death. We hope that our compatriots will not regard these words as irrelevant."</p>
<h3>Real Estate Inside and Outside the Concessions Is Handled the Same for Mortgages: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Agrees with the Land Bureau's Proposal</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce agreed with the Land Bureau's proposal to send letters to the banking and money industries associations, advocating that real estate outside the concessions should not be discriminated against and should be included in the cash reserve for loans in the same way as real estate inside the concessions. Yesterday, it sent a letter to the Land Bureau, which reads: "In reply, we received your letter of the 14th of this month and learned the details. We have found that real estate outside the concessions should be treated the same as real estate inside the concessions for mortgages, and there should be no difference in treatment. This association highly agrees with your proposal. Since your bureau has sent a letter to the banking and money industries, it is thought that they also share the same sentiments."</p>

<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegrams the Government, Requesting It to Faithfully Declare and Protect Creditworthiness: Unscrupulous People Create Rumors of Interest Rate Reduction on Government Bonds, Inevitably Shaking People's Hearts and Striking a Blow to Shanghai's Situation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "Nanjing Executive Yuan and Ministry of Finance: We have just received a letter from Jin Runxiang, a standing committee member of our association, stating that since the September 18th Incident in Liaoning, followed by the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, we have been threatened by strong enemies from the outside and have suffered from frequent natural disasters from the inside. In recent years, we have encountered an unprecedented economic national crisis. Shanghai, known as the number one commercial port, has also been hit by the global economic downturn, causing the collapse of all industries and making it impossible to survive. People with foresight have been running around and making announcements, trying to find ways to provide relief. Ultimately, due to the depletion of funds and the difficulty in turnover, there is no way to reverse the situation. Due to the stagnation of real estate, the credit funds of tens of billions of yuan that were relied on for operations have become useless. Now, the only credit fund that society regards as reliable is government bonds, which are more popular among the people than real estate. The assets of all financial enterprises, the funds of public and private institutions, and the revenue use of charitable and public welfare organizations all rely on the purchase of bonds and interest. However, in recent days, the rumors of reducing bond interest rates and postponing the repayment of principal have become rampant. Newspapers have published articles, but there is no consensus. The entire city is spreading the news, alarming each other. The current social economy is on the verge of exhaustion. How can we pick the melons from the Huangtai vine again? If this is implemented, the national finance and social economy will inevitably collapse together, plunging our country into an irredeemable situation. Isn't it just as the National Government's order of February 24, 1932, stated: 'The price of bonds will plummet, and the social economy will suffer a lot.' In the aforementioned order, it was clearly stated that this was the final decision of the government and the people to maintain creditworthiness and regulate finance. Once the order is issued, it will be a permanent decision. In the future, no matter how difficult the financial situation is, the aforementioned funds must not be shaken in the slightest, nor should there be any changes, to show great faith. The Ministry of Finance's announcement and Minister Song's declaration were even more important documents, recorded in the books. It is said that without faith, the people cannot stand. There is a rest soil there, how can the people forget their hearts. It is believed that Minister Kong has been in charge of the budget for several years, and all his measures have been to show the people faith. Since President Jiang took on the difficult task, it has been like a timely rain for the people, and he will never be willing to fall into great faith and be criticized by the world. However, the rumor of reducing bond interest and postponing the principal may be a rumor created by treacherous people who intend to make profits, not hesitating to be heartbroken and crazy, and creating slanderous words in order to speculate. However, it has been found that whenever rumors arise, our wise authorities will always rely on the facts and make a fair defense, so as to stabilize people's hearts, and the intention is very profound. Why are the government bonds, which are related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, uniquely spread by night rumors without being heard? This is really puzzling. The panic in the market is becoming more intense. The ignorant people are already unable to bear the shock of rumors. The leaders of this association, looking forward to the future, plan to quickly submit a document requesting President Jiang of the Executive Yuan and Minister Kong of Finance to make a firm statement that there is no plan to reduce the payment of bond principal and interest, so that unscrupulous and treacherous people cannot use it to confuse the public, so as to maintain creditworthiness and stabilize people's hearts. We cannot win the waiting for orders and so on. It is found that the aforementioned rumors of government bonds reducing interest and postponing the repayment of principal are fabricated rumors created by unscrupulous people in order to satisfy their selfish desires. However, the bonds are issued by the government. Unless the government makes a firm statement, the rumors will inevitably shake people's hearts and make Shanghai's precarious situation suffer another blow. It is reasonable to telegraph the Executive Yuan (Ministry) for review and to quickly issue a clear order and faithfully declare it, so that the plans of treacherous people will not be sold, and the situation of doubt and fear will be stabilized. It is a public convenience."</p>

<h3>Railway Cargo Compensation: Should Be Handled According to Regulations Immediately; Strictly Limit Free Passes to Prevent Abuse; Open Scenic Spots and Historical Sites Along the Line as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Railways, considering that various lines often misinterpret regulations and refuse compensation when merchants request it for cargo damage during responsible transportation, has issued a special order to all lines to handle cargo compensation matters quickly and according to regulations, without evasion, in order to demonstrate genuine responsibility and gain public trust. Furthermore, noting the excessive issuance of free passes by various lines, which inevitably affects railway revenue, an order was also issued to thoroughly rectify this situation, and to open scenic spots and historical sites along the lines as tourist attractions to attract visitors. The original text of the two orders is recorded below:</p>
<p>Genuine Responsibility</p>
<p>It has been three years since various lines began handling responsible transportation. Although business has gradually improved, special attention has not been adequately paid to damage compensation. Whenever cargo is lost, the cause is often not thoroughly investigated, or responsibility is shifted between parties, resulting in merchants' compensation requests being rejected by misinterpreting regulations, or cases dragging on for months. Merchants suffer from this loss and complain. Railways are public utilities, and they should provide merchants with safety guarantees for transported goods to fulfill their responsibilities. Since railways have publicly committed to responsible transportation, they should genuinely take responsibility to gain the trust of merchants and the public. Hereafter, the following two points should be given careful attention regarding cargo compensation matters:</p>
<p>Compensation According to Regulations</p>
<p>(1) Cargo compensation matters should be handled "according to regulations." Except for goods that the railway is not responsible for transporting as stipulated in Article 7 of the General Rules for Cargo Transportation, losses not caused by railway negligence, and losses due to reasons listed in Article 8 of the General Rules for Cargo Transportation, where no compensation is required, all losses occurring during railway transportation or storage should be compensated. Regulations should not be misinterpreted to evade responsibility. For joint transportation, delivery procedures should be carefully observed to clarify responsibility. Cases should be handled according to regulations, without shifting responsibility or delaying matters.</p>
<p>Prompt Handling</p>
<p>(2) Cargo compensation matters should be handled "promptly." After a merchant requests compensation for cargo loss following the procedures stipulated in Article 60 of the General Rules for Cargo Transportation, the railway should quickly investigate. If the railway is responsible, compensation procedures should be completed as soon as possible, within one month at most, according to Article 61 of the General Rules for Cargo Transportation. The investigation and punishment of responsible employees are internal matters and should not delay the compensation process. All lines should strictly follow the above two points.</p>
<p>Limiting Free Passes</p>
<p>Passenger transportation is the main business of the railway. Its quality, and the effectiveness of management, are closely related to railway revenue and reputation. It should be thoroughly rectified and improved as soon as possible. The three most important points are listed below: (1) The issuance of free passes should be strictly limited. Railways have regulations for issuing free passes and preferential certificates to employees and their families to show consideration and provide encouragement. Employees should strictly abide by the regulations and appreciate this intention. However, over time, laxity is inevitable. Unscrupulous employees may request passes excessively and transfer them to relatives and friends. Furthermore, non-railway employees may also issue them arbitrarily. Statistics show that the losses amount to millions each year, which is shocking. Hereafter, when employees of various lines request free passes or preferential certificates for family members, a strict review should be conducted, and a detailed comparison should be made with the employee's family list. If there is any discrepancy, the pass should not be issued. Ticket inspectors should also carefully investigate when checking tickets. If there is any unauthorized use, the fare should be immediately charged, and the applicant should be severely punished to eliminate long-standing abuses and maintain railway revenue.</p>
<p>Verifying Tickets Diligently</p>
<p>(2) The ticket verification system should be strictly implemented. The ticket verification system on various lines is inconsistent. Passengers may have their tickets verified once upon entering the station, re-verified on the train, and then verified again upon exiting the arrival station, or verified on the train before arriving at the station. Even on the same line, the ticket collection method varies depending on the station. This should be thoroughly studied and improved. Furthermore, ticket inspectors at various stations are either too late in arriving or too negligent, and they often fail to strictly crack down on passengers without tickets. Also, the number of ticket checks on trains is too small, or there are no checks at night, which allows short-distance passengers to ride without tickets or ride beyond their stop, greatly affecting railway revenue. Hereafter, various lines should strictly rectify and supervise this.</p>
<p>Opening for Tourism</p>
<p>(3) Tourism should be actively promoted. Numerous scenic spots and historical sites along the lines of various stations should be opened as tourist attractions to attract visitors and increase railway revenue. The above three points are all closely related to passenger business and railway revenue and are extremely important. All lines should make every effort to implement them to achieve rectification, and the implementation situation should be reported at any time for inspection and verification.</p>
<h3>The Sand Under the Ship's Bottom Suddenly Loosened: The Ningjing Wheel Has Escaped Danger; Discharged Cargo Still Being Loaded onto the Original Ship; Arrival in Shanghai Delayed by Two Days Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>The Ningjing Wheel of the Ningshao Company ran aground near Chenjiazhou, downstream of Jiujiang, on its return journey from Hankou to Shanghai. Because the Yangtze River was shallow, it could not get out. The company immediately sent a ship to unload the cargo. On the 14th, when more than 200 tons had been discharged, the old Ningshao Wheel went to tow it, but the Ningshao wire cable broke, and it could not be pulled out. However, yesterday afternoon, the company suddenly received a wireless telegram from the Ningjing Wheel stating that the sand under the ship's bottom had recently suddenly loosened, and the Ningjing Wheel had taken the opportunity to sail out of the shoal. The discharged cargo is now being loaded back onto the original ship to be brought to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive tomorrow morning, which is two days later than originally scheduled.</p>
<h3>The Money Industry Started Its Final Settlement Yesterday: A Meeting Will Be Held on the 25th to Decide on Business Policies; The Banking and Money Industries Will Confer to Obey Orders to Reduce Interest Rates</h3>
<p>The time for the final settlement of all industries in the Republic of China in 1935 on January 23rd is approaching rapidly. Various money houses started handling the final settlement yesterday and have scheduled an executive committee meeting on the 25th to decide on this year's business policies. Commercial banks will uniformly tighten up this year, and the banking and money industries will confer to reduce interest rates. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Money Industry Issues Statements</p>
<p>As the time for the final settlement of the money houses in the Republic of China in 1935 is approaching, they started handling the final settlement yesterday. The interest rate is 2.5 yuan. Statements are issued to each customer, and runners are sent to collect outstanding payments. Starting from the 19th, the time for collecting and returning checks will be extended. Another statement will be issued on the 20th. All outstanding payments must be completely cleared before the 23rd, and account books should be returned. After the final settlement period, they will be redistributed. The collection and delivery of money between the banking and money industries has suddenly become busy since yesterday. Yesterday, the interbank overnight loan rate remained at 8 fen per 1000 yuan per day. The collection and delivery of money between the banking and money industries has been busy. The total exchange volume of the bank clearing house has increased to 25,135,521.85 yuan, of which 4,182,938.75 yuan was collected on behalf of the money industry.</p>
<p>Business Policies of Various Firms</p>
<p>The Money Industry Association has decided to hold the third eighth executive committee meeting on the 25th of this month (i.e., the second day of the first lunar month) at the Money Industry Association Hall in the northern part of the city. In addition to holding a group worship, it will also discuss business policies after the final settlement. It is said that various money houses, in view of the sluggish market conditions, will try to focus on mortgage lending and strive to tighten credit lending in order to be cautious. As for the Henry Zhen small money house, which is not a member of the association and whose main business was originally secret note coupons, the government has concentrated the issuance of currency notes and various banks have cancelled secret note coupons, resulting in a major blow to their business. After the final settlement, they will change their business policies.</p>
<p>Conferring on Reducing Interest Rates</p>
<p>Since Yu Qiaqing, Liu Hongsheng, Rong Zongjing, Guo Shun, Nie Lusheng, and other five people requested the Ministry of Finance to reduce interest rates, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the banking and money industry associations have all received orders from the ministry to handle it. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency interviewed Secretary-General Lin of the Banking Association last night. According to him, after receiving the order to reduce interest rates, the banking and money industry associations will hold a joint meeting after the final settlement of all industries in 1935 to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Commercial Banks Tighten Up</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that after the accounts were settled last year, the profits of various commercial banks, except for the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, have decreased compared with previous years. Starting this year, they will uniformly tighten up and reduce the number of employees in the issuance, remittance, and cashier departments to save expenses. Banks that issue banknotes have reduced their issuance affairs since the government concentrated the issuance and restricted the increase in issuance. Banks that handle domestic and foreign remittances have balanced domestic remittances and foreign remittances in accordance with the central government's listing price after the entire country used legal currency and the three banks traded foreign exchange without restrictions, reducing remittance affairs. Since the prohibition of the use of silver coins and the regulation of legal currency, the cashier affairs of various banks have been greatly reduced.</p>

<h3>Telephone Problem Committee: Requests That a Taxpayers' Meeting Be Convened to Fundamentally Eliminate the Telephone Price Increase</h3>
<p>The Special District Telephone Problem Committee sent letters yesterday to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession, the Western Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession, and the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, requesting that a taxpayers' meeting be convened to protest the telephone price increase. The original text reads: "Dear Sirs, at a time when the market is declining and business is sluggish, we are feeling the pain of 'it is not easy to live in Shanghai.' Under the pressure of reducing food and clothing, would we rather increase the burden on our lives and engage in impractical extravagance? This is the result of the Shanghai Telephone Company's disguised price increase. I am afraid that the majority of users will inevitably abandon it. Considering that your association is the supervisory body of the Public Concession Bureau of Works (French Concession Board of Directors), we dare to ask you to convene a meeting of Chinese (Western) taxpayers' representatives to raise objections and fundamentally oppose the price increase, in order to eliminate it and maintain the remaining situation. As the saying goes, 'A gentleman loves people with virtue, while a petty person loves people with indulgence.' What to choose? I think your wise gentlemen will definitely choose the good and follow it."</p>
<h3>Minsheng Company's Newly Built Minyun Shipping Vessel: Maiden Voyage to Chongqing Yesterday; In Addition, There Are Seven New Vessels Still Being Completed to Develop the Sichuan River</h3>
<p>In order to develop the Sichuan River shipping industry, the Minsheng Industrial Company specially ordered eight new vessels from the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Institute and the Hexing Machinery Factory shipyard in this port for transportation. The first vessel, the Minyun, is 113 feet long, 22 feet wide, 8.3 feet deep, has a draft of 6.9 feet, a deadweight of 180 tons, a speed of 13 nautical miles per hour, and cost over 110,000 yuan. It was contracted by the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Institute in September of last year. After the launching ceremony in late November, the cabin positions were actively renovated and the machinery was installed. All the work was completed at the end of last year, and the company's logo was painted. It is now known that the vessel was put into service last night for its maiden voyage directly to Chongqing, with a large number of passengers and goods. It will return to Shanghai at the end of the month. In addition, there are seven other new vessels, including three that are 135 feet long, one that is 145 feet long, and three that are 80 feet long. The total cost is 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. The Hexing and Jiangnan factories are separately responsible for the construction. The Jiangnan factory is building two vessels, and the Hexing factory is building five. All are scheduled to be completed by the end of April this year. They have been named Minkang, Minshi, Minting, Minguo, and Guoben, and will operate on the Sichuan-Hankou-Yichang-Chongqing, Sichuan-Shanghai-Yichang-Xushui, and Chongqing-Fuling routes. After this, regardless of dry or flood season, there will be no worry about the lack of ships for passengers and goods entering Sichuan. Statistics show that the company now has 47 large and small transport ships, which have made a great contribution to restoring shipping rights and developing Sichuan.</p>
<h3>Representatives of YUyao Salt Farmers: Continued Petitioning Yesterday; Salt Merchants Still Insist on Not Collecting Salt in Full According to Orders; Starvation and Cold Threaten to Lead to Accidents</h3>
<p>Since the salt merchants of Yuyao Salt Field secretly approved the reduction of the amount of salt transported by 60%, the people have been panicked, and dangerous situations have arisen. Representatives such as Shang Cailian have been repeatedly sent to Shanghai to petition. Although the Salt Affairs Audit General Office and the Salt Affairs Office have repeatedly ordered the transporter to order the salt merchants to collect salt in full as soon as possible to maintain livelihoods, details have been reported in the newspapers. However, since the order was issued, it has been more than a month, and the salt merchants have still not collected salt in full according to the order. The salt farmers have no choice but to send representatives such as Shang Cailian to Shanghai again to petition and appeal to all parties for assistance. At about 11 o'clock yesterday morning, representatives such as Shang Cailian went to the Salt Affairs Audit General Office again to petition. Chief Inspector Feng received them and said that he had again ordered the transporter to strictly order the salt merchants to collect salt in full. According to the salt farmer representatives, the end of the lunar year is approaching rapidly. In the face of starvation and cold, if the salt is not collected in full according to the order, the 100,000 salt farmers will have no way to sell official salt (i.e., quota salt) and will be in a dilemma. Taking risks, it is inevitable that accidents will occur. According to the investigation, the five Yongshengyuantai factories in the five districts, in addition to the 60% reduction, only need 100,000+ yuan to collect all the remainder, and the Donggong salt merchants in Zhejiang only need 100,000 yuan and four yuan. The salt merchants in total only need 200,000+ yuan, and there are many salt merchants with assets of over one million. There are still kind people to provide disaster relief in Jiangbei, and in the case of Yuyao Salt Field, which collects salt in full according to the order, the price of salt is used as payment. The ruling authorities are urged to order the salt merchants to collect salt in full as soon as possible to maintain livelihoods and eliminate disasters. The order is copied below: No. 1518 from the Hangzhou General Office. Regarding the case of Yuyao Salt Field requiring salt merchants to collect salt according to the quota, the office has ordered and reported compliance with Nos. 1447, 1460, and 1465 of the office. Now, according to the telegram from the salt farmer representatives of the B District of the salt field, such as Shang Caisuyi, (the entire original text is narrated), the situation is extremely urgent. And according to the representatives' request to come to the office, this case has been repeatedly ordered and should be handled according to the established regulations. The merchants are ordered to make up the salt collection in full, and the handling situation should be reported in compliance with the order. General Office Zheng,</p>
<h3>The Mining Federation Presents a Petition to the Ministries of Industry and Finance: To Reduce the Coal Mine Production Tax Rate</h3>
<p>Wang Zhengting, Chairman, Zhang Zhongping, Vice Chairman, and others of the Mining Federation of the Republic of China, submitted separate petitions to the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the tax rate on coal minerals be reduced annually according to the current percentage. The original petition stated, "In order to continuously present a petition, we earnestly request that the previous request for the tax rate on coal minerals to be reduced annually be approved and implemented as soon as possible to alleviate commercial difficulties and comfort the public's expectations. We respectfully request your review of the matter. Regarding the matter of the tax rate on coal minerals, which should be clearly stipulated, the subordinate association has stated the reasons and repeatedly and earnestly presented them, and publicly recommended representatives such as Mr. Qian Xinzhi to go to the ministry to appeal. In September of last year, the Ministry of Finance (General Department) issued Order No. 6936 on Taxes, stating that at present, the central government's finances are extremely difficult, and the mining industry should be maintained, and tax revenue should also be taken into account. The request to reduce the tax rate on coal minerals should not be approved for the time being, etc. The subordinate association again respected the Ministry of Finance's (General Department) principle of maintaining the mining industry and taking into account tax revenue, and continued to submit a petition to the General Department (to consult with the Ministry of Finance, to be jointly handled by the Ministry of Industry) on the 24th of the same month, requesting that the tax rate on coal minerals be stipulated and reduced to 4% from 1936, 3% from 1937, and that by 1938, it should be levied according to 2% as an example, so that both tax revenue and coal mines can benefit each other. The General Department (Ministry of Industry) issued Instruction No. 12808 on Mines, stating that it has been forwarded for verification and handling, etc. Now, more than three months have passed, and no reply from the Ministry of Finance (General Department) has been received. The public is looking forward to it, and the mines are constantly coming to the association to inquire. The previous proposal was based on the resolution of the council of the subordinate association and the wishes of the mines are not fully satisfied. It is urgent to stipulate it as soon as possible, otherwise, the coal mines will inevitably be hesitant to pay coal taxes this year, and it is feared that it will affect tax revenue and lead to deviation. Therefore, we again submit the previous request. We respectfully request the General Department to examine the Ministry of Finance and to promptly approve the method of reducing the tax rate on coal minerals according to the existing percentage, as presented by the subordinate association, so as to alleviate commercial difficulties and comfort the public's expectations. We cannot bear to wait in fear and urgency for your order."</p>

He said that a meeting of the entire committee could not be held immediately because Chairman Zeng Yangfu could not come to Shanghai temporarily due to official business. However, the main work at present is to continue to popularize and promote improvements in various provinces. When necessary, students from sericulture vocational schools and other schools must go to the countryside to provide guidance.</p>

<h3>Qiao Jinliang, Director of the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, Takes Office Today</h3>

<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Answers: Questions on Penalties for Stamp Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied to Longhua Yongtai Brick and Tile Company yesterday, answering questions about the penalties for stamp tax law: "The new stamp tax law stipulates that the penalty for not affixing stamp tax stamps is 10 to 30 times the tax payable, but if the amount is less than 3 yuan, the penalty is 3 yuan. Therefore, the penalty for each invoice is 3 yuan. When several items are penalized together, the amount may not exceed three times the heaviest penalty. Therefore, the penalty for three invoices is 9 yuan, and the penalty for more than three invoices is also 9 yuan. However, if there are account books involved, the calculation method is different. The responsibility for affixing stamps to invoices lies with the issuer of the invoice, so the responsibility for the penalty also lies with the issuer."</p>
<h3>International Labor Bureau Studies Laborers' Smoking Problem, Included in This Year's Conference Agenda for Discussion, Notable Investigation Finds Chinese Laborers Predominant</h3>
<p>In light of the significant impact of opium on laborers, the International Labor Bureau, based on materials investigated by the League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee, has thoroughly analyzed this issue. The conclusion is that, among the areas investigated (Burma, Straits Settlements, Federated Malay States, Malaya, Borneo, Sarawak, British North Borneo, Dutch East Indies, Siam, Indochina, Guangzhou Bay, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Kwantung Leased Territory, South Manchuria Railway Zone, and the Philippines), Chinese laborers are the most addicted to opium. Overseas Chinese who have grown up in these areas are less affected. Indigenous laborers who have contact with Chinese laborers and work under the same conditions are also prone to opium addiction. There is no evidence of using workers' opium addiction during recruitment. Government authorities or employers rarely implement measures to detect and prevent the exploitation of opium use during recruitment, or to crack down on the recruitment and import of opium addicts. Regarding employment, there is no evidence of exploiting opium use, but the consequences of opium addiction may restrict workers' freedom to change jobs. Regarding employers or their agents pre-paying wages, although there is no evidence, it is not uncommon for opium-addicted workers to accumulate debts by spending most of their wages on opium. Opium addiction reduces work capacity and efficiency. In heavy labor, opium may sometimes help maintain work capacity and efficiency, but it cannot last long. Opium addiction weakens the body, increases mortality, and is a cause of disease. The impact of opium addiction on life and work is influenced by the working environment and living conditions. Workers often resort to opium to relieve hardship, illness, and poverty. Being away from home and living in extraordinary social environments, working in isolated places (such as tin mines), and lacking proper entertainment are all reasons why workers become addicted to opium. The result is that social progress in the region is slowed down. Opium addiction is not insurmountable. If workers' working and living conditions can be improved, such as setting working hours that laborers can handle, paying wages sufficient for workers to have a normal healthy and comfortable living standard, establishing a comprehensive medical organization to provide workers with various conveniences, allowing workers who are away from home to bring their families, enabling them to grow food, and organizing various conveniences for leisure activities, so that workers have proper entertainment during their leisure time. This issue has been included in the agenda for discussion at the 20th International Labor Conference in June this year. The report stated that Chinese laborers were found to be the most addicted to opium, and it is hoped that people in our country will pay close attention to this issue.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Batavia Concerned About the Motherland and Enthusiastically Donate to Disaster Relief, Fourth Batch of Relief Funds of 10,000 Yuan Remitted</h3>
<p>The Xia, Yangtze, and Yellow Rivers in Henan have continuously flooded, the severity of the disaster and the extent of the affected area are unprecedented. Wang Zhengting, Chairman of the China International Famine Relief Commission, with the approval of the Ministry of Interior, organized a fundraising campaign for flood relief for the rivers, engaging in relief efforts, sending letters and telegrams to appeal to people at home and abroad, and making every effort to solicit donations. Moved by this, people who generously donated large sums of money were particularly enthusiastic. Batavia is a famous major port in the Nanyang Islands. Overseas Chinese in the area have always had a patriotic fervor. Whenever there are disasters in the country, they generously donate to relief efforts. Upon hearing of the disaster, they immediately joined with colleagues to form the Batavia Disaster Relief Association, making every effort to solicit donations. The obtained relief funds were sent to the consulate for remittance to the Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and then forwarded to the Shanghai Office of the China International Famine Relief Commission at 505 Henan Road in this city for distribution. Three batches have been sent before and after, each batch being 10,000 yuan. It is heard that the fourth batch of relief funds of 10,000 yuan was remitted the day before yesterday, and was still transferred by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the office for distribution.

Yesterday, the fifth meeting of directors and supervisors decided to first purchase 100 shi of relief rice, plus 3 shi of relief rice donated, and distribute them to the various district offices in Baoshan. Donation books for outstanding donations will be sent out again for urging. When there is a certain amount of money, relief will continue to be distributed to benefit the disaster victims. The names of the donors will be published in the newspaper later to express gratitude and promote benevolence.</p>
<h3>Domestic Light Bulb Industry's Production and Sales Situation Last Year</h3>
<p>Since the founding of the Yabuer factory more than a decade ago, many smaller light bulb factories have been established one after another. The output of domestic light bulbs has also gradually increased, to the point of surplus. In addition to Yabuer, there are more than ten brands such as Huatong, Flaisheng, Yongming, Yongliang, Xinguanghua, Guohua, Guotai, Zhonghua, Dexiling, Huade, Zhongguo, Yaerden, Mingguang, Haoyou, and Daguangming. Last year's total output was estimated at 16.2 million bulbs. Among them, the Yabuer brand accounted for one-third, with the highest price being 22 yuan per hundred (ordinary bulbs) and the lowest being 8 yuan per hundred (ordinary bulbs). Although raw material prices have risen, due to the market not yet turning around, it is difficult to raise prices suddenly.</p>

<h3>There Are Seventeen Death Penalties in the Anti-Drug and Anti-Smoking Regulations, Those with Opium Addiction Should Quit as Soon as Possible, Second Special Court Also Complies with the New Regulations</h3>
<p>The First Special District Court has been implementing the anti-drug and anti-smoking crime regulations promulgated by the Anti-Smoking Commissioner since the day before yesterday. Drug cases transferred by the police will be sentenced in accordance with the regulations. After reviewing the two regulations, there are seventeen death penalties and five life sentences. The minimum sentence is imprisonment for more than six months and less than two years for opium smoking, but medical rehabilitation can be arranged. Those who re-offend after undergoing rehabilitation for more than two times may be sentenced to death. In addition, those who manufacture, transport, sell, or intend to sell drugs, or who administer morphine to others or provide premises for others to use drugs, will be sentenced to death once the case is proven. Civil servants who harbor or solicit bribes and condone others committing crimes under Articles 3 to 10 of the regulations will be sentenced to death. School teachers, staff, and students who commit crimes will also be sentenced to death. Those who commit drug crimes and re-offend after rehabilitation will be sentenced to death. Anyone with opium addiction should quit as soon as possible. The Second Special Court in the French Concession has received orders to comply with the anti-drug and anti-smoking regulations. Because the French Concession authorities and the police department have not yet reached an agreement on the newly promulgated regulations, yesterday the police department transferred three opium cases to the Second Special Court, totaling ten offenders. The police department's lawyer still prosecuted the main and accessory offenders in the case in accordance with Articles 259 and 262 of the Criminal Code and the opium crime provisions. After questioning the defendants, the trial judge Li Changnian announced that the court would handle opium cases in accordance with the newly promulgated anti-drug and anti-smoking crime regulations, and ordered all three cases to be rescheduled for the 18th, designating defense lawyers for further interrogation, and the defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Archaeologist Marston Arrives in Shanghai on a Trip Around the World, Talks About His Interests in Palestine</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the world-renowned archaeologist Sir Marston, accompanied by his wife and daughter, arrived in Shanghai on the Kagao on Tuesday (14th). Sir Marston is currently on a world tour with his book, planning to stay in Shanghai for two weeks, then go to India, and then to Palestine. Sir Marston's interest is focused on that place. Sir Marston said on the ship yesterday (14th), "I am now traveling with my wife and daughter to see the East, as they have never been here before." Sir Marston has compiled his archaeological findings in Palestine into a book called "New Evidence of the Bible," which depicts three countries engaged in excavating antiquities in Palestine. Sir Marston also said, "Everything we have found in that place can prove everything in the Old Testament. We have obtained the writings of Bo Mu, which are from around the time of Moses. The most important excavation is being carried out in the ancient city of Lachish, which was once a Jewish state and is historically second only to Jerusalem. Excavations have also begun in the ancient city of Jericho, reaching a depth of sixty feet before anything was found, because after the ancient city was destroyed, later generations rebuilt new cities on top of it, several times, layer upon layer. The oldest of these dates back to 6,000 BC, and 4,000 BC before the Jews entered Palestine. Their civilizations all belong to the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods. To date, many important items have been obtained."</p>
<h3>Explorer Farnham Arrives in Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the lecturer, explorer, and author Miss Farnham is well-known in Shanghai. In 1932, she visited Shanghai and traveled to the interior. Later, she wrote a book called "Wandering in the Forbidden Land of Tibet," which was very popular in various countries, and often provided her travel essays and landscape photos to magazines around the world. She returned to Shanghai from New York on the Kagao on Tuesday. Miss Farnham's current destination has not yet been decided. It is heard that she plans to fly to Lanzhou, and then go to Qinghai by land, or go to the Panchen Lama. Miss Farnham recently gave travel lectures in the United States, which just ended before Christmas. If her plan for a second lecture tour in the United States is successful, she may return to the United States in two or three weeks, and begin traveling around the states in March, and then come to Shanghai again in June. Miss Farnham is an independent traveler and does not rely on the support of any magazine or organization. She packs her bags and travels wherever she wants, returning when she is satisfied, which is very free and easy. Her travel expenses come from lectures and writing. In 1932, she entered Qinghai from Lanzhou, hoping to see the high mountains where the Yellow River originates, which are even higher than the mountains she usually lives in. Her companions Simpson and Hafatz were killed by Hui bandits in Gansu. Miss Farnham had temporarily left the two of them and was spared. Miss Farnham still wants to travel west to fulfill her long-cherished wish.</p>
<h3>Qin Weiye, Director of Tongyuan Bank, Abducted but Escapes Dangerously, Chauffeur Suddenly Has a Stroke of Genius and Crashes Car into Tram, Tram Driver Quarrels and the Abductors Flee</h3>
<p>Qin Weiye, a native of Ningbo, 30 years old, is a director of Tongyuan Bank on Tianjin Road in this city. He lives at No. 30, Lane 473 (Lianzhuli) of Avenue Road. He used to have a Buick car for transportation, with the license plate number 22000. At about 10:00 am yesterday, Qin stepped out of his house, intending to take his own car to the bank to work at the alleyway entrance. Unexpectedly, five men suddenly appeared at the intersection of Datong Road and Avenue Road, each holding a pistol, surrounding the car and preventing it from moving. Three bandits jumped into the car, while two bandits monitored Qin, and one bandit guarded the chauffeur, ordering him to drive west quickly. At that time, Qin's chauffeur, unable to resist, had no choice but to comply. Just as he was starting the engine, the chauffeur saw an No. 19 trolleybus slowly approaching. He suddenly had a stroke of genius and turned the car to crash into the trolleybus. At that time, the driver of the trolleybus saw the car changing direction and about to cause an accident, so he quickly braked and came down to argue with the chauffeur. The chauffeur also deliberately acted unreasonably, causing a quarrel, which attracted countless spectators to watch. However, the bandits in the car were greatly panicked and realized that they had been discovered, so they quickly pushed open the car doors and fled to the side without a trace. Before long, the patrol officers arrived. After the chauffeur told them the reason for deliberately crashing the car, they suddenly realized what was going on. So they ordered the trolleybus to continue driving as usual, and then took Qin and others in the original car to the Xinzha Police Station to report the incident. After a detailed investigation by the detectives, they found many fingerprints on the car doors and other places, which they photographed one by one, filed for future investigation, and dispatched detectives to pursue and arrest the bandits. They also praised the chauffeur's ingenuity. Otherwise, it would have been difficult for Qin Weiye to escape this dangerous situation.</p>

<h3>Wang Wenguang Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday on a Walking Trip Across the Country</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the feat of young people walking across the country has been quite popular in recent years, but most of them cannot travel long distances. The reporter met Mr. Wang Wenguang, who is traveling long distances on foot, yesterday. Mr. Wang started from Tianjin, walked along the Jinpu and Jinghu Roads to Shanghai, and plans to travel south from Shanghai to Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and other provinces.

Now Mr. Wang plans to find a travel companion to avoid loneliness on the journey.</p>
<h3>Chief Inspector of the Public Concession, Mr. Jollard, Returns to Shanghai, Studies Methods of Managing Vehicles, Detailed Report to Be Released Soon</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, Mr. Jollard, the Chief Inspector of the Public Concession, recently traveled extensively in Europe and the United States to study police affairs, and returned to Shanghai on the Kagao on Tuesday (14th). Mr. Jollard left Shanghai several months ago to focus on studying the traffic conditions in cities in Western countries, in order to solve the problem of the increasingly prosperous traffic in Shanghai. Mr. Jollard visited Vancouver, Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, and other places to study the methods of police departments managing traffic. He then went to London to study London's methods. The Public Concession also sent Deputy Inspector Leslie to stay in the London Police Department for some time to study traffic conditions. Leslie had already returned to Shanghai. Jollard said on the ship yesterday (14th), "I am not yet able to announce the results of this trip. I stayed in London the longest, and the methods used there to manage traffic are very suitable for Shanghai." A guest asked if automatic traffic lights could be used on Shanghai's prosperous streets, such as Jing'an Temple Road, Nanjing Road, and Sichuan Road, to reduce congestion. Jollard replied that many large cities in the United States have already used this system. If the cost borne by the Public Concession is not too high, it would be very beneficial to use it in Shanghai. The New York City Police Department has been studying various traffic management regulations for many years, but the traffic conditions in that city are still very bad. It is suspected that Jollard will now submit a detailed report of his investigation to the Public Concession.</p>
<h3>Due to the Shanghai Incident, No Work to Be Found, Impoverished, Requests the Consulate to Send Him Back to Japan</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese Daily News, Yamazaki Seiji, a Japanese carpenter living at No. 22, Haining Road, went to the Japanese Consulate General yesterday to request protection and repatriation to Japan. Yamazaki came to Shanghai in the tenth year of the Republic of China. Initially, it was due to family illness, and then the Shanghai Incident, which made his business even more difficult. He borrowed money from friends and borrowed reconstruction funds to barely make ends meet. Until recently, he could not find any work and was in a state of extreme poverty, and was burdened with four family members, including his wife and daughters. He had no choice but to request the Consulate General to find a way to return home.</p>
<h3>Large Fire in Bailianjing, Pudong Last Night – Zhuhang Ice Factory Reduced to Ashes – Total Estimated Loss Approximately 10,000 Taels of Gold – Difficulty Obtaining Water Made Rescue Difficult, Leading to This Great Calamity</h3>
<p>Yuchang Zhuhang, located at the Bailianjing port in Pudong, is a branch of the Hu Yuchang Wood Company south of Dongjiadu in the southern city. It has a history of over twenty years, specializing in bamboo materials and being quite prosperous. The company has over ten warehouses and a very large bamboo storage area. Recently, they had taken in a large shipment. It is unknown how, but a fire suddenly broke out around 8:30 last night. Only a long-term worker from Ningbo, surnamed Wang, was watching the premises at night. By the time he noticed, it was impossible to extinguish. Moreover, bamboo materials ignite and burn quickly. In an instant, flames soared high into the sky, visible within a ten-mile radius. The fire intensified. Patrol Officer Dai Baoqing from the South Wharf Police Station reported the incident to the Tangqiao Police Station, which notified various fire departments for assistance. Zhao Longsheng, director of the Pudong Fire Brigade, led his team and rushed to the scene by car. Due to the distance, it took half an hour to arrive. After a while, Shen Yu, director of the Yangjing Fire Brigade, also dispatched a vehicle to assist. However, as the fire scene was far on the Pudong side, the fire trucks could only stop on Pudong Avenue, about a mile away. Furthermore, the roads were winding and narrow, making it impossible for large fire engines to enter. As a result, the Pudong district used a portable small pump to carry water to the fire scene for extinguishing. However, due to the delay, the fire had already spread to the two old ice factories opened by Chen Baomin east of Zhuhang, which had been in operation for over thirty years. The intensity of the fire was overwhelming. Firefighters tried their best to extinguish the fire, but to no avail. Moreover, there were several dormitory rooms for the water patrol team near the port, dangerously close to the fire. The firefighters changed their strategy, first securing the nearby houses before focusing on extinguishing the fire. As the fire weakened, they vigorously poured water on the fire scene, gradually extinguishing it. However, as flames were still raging inside, the rescue efforts continued. In this disaster, over ten buildings of Yuchang Zhuhang, along with all the bamboo materials, were completely burned down, with a loss of over 5,000 taels of gold. It is said that the company had fire insurance, but the amount is unknown. The two ice factories were also reduced to ashes. The factory buildings alone were worth over 2,000 taels of gold, and the ice stored inside, which was half of the factory’s capacity, was also worth over 2,000 taels of gold. The total loss is estimated at around 10,000 taels of gold. Afterwards, the South Wharf Police Station took Wang, the Zhuhang worker, to the station to inquire about the cause of the fire. He only said that it started in the kitchen and that the cause was unknown. That night, Patrol Officer Dai ordered that he be sent to the Tangqiao Police Station for investigation.</p>
<h3>New Accounting Officer to be Appointed at Japanese Embassy, Specializing in Supervising Accounting</h3>
<p>The Japanese Shanghai Daily reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends to establish an accounting officer and increase the number of telegraph operators to expand its internal structure. The plan has been included in the next year's budget. Starting from next year, all major embassies abroad will have an accounting officer specifically to supervise the embassy's accounting. It is planned to first establish positions in Shanghai, New York, and London. The Shanghai accounting officer will supervise the accounting of all consulates general and consulates in China, and will also oversee the funding of resident groups and the reconstruction funds. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has dispatched Counselor Wano to China to investigate. The motive for this establishment is due to the embezzlement of public funds by Deputy Consul Mogi in Qingdao.</p>
<h3>Old Zha Gate Police Arrested Several Major Robbers, Seized Pistols and Mauser Pistols, etc. The Robbers Were Detained Pending Investigation of Crimes</h3>
<p>Yun A'gen, the Chinese Chief Detective of the Old Zha Gate Police, learned that a large gang of major robbers was gathering in room 107 of the Andong Hotel on Hubei Road, plotting wrongdoing. He led Chinese Detectives Lu Gensheng, Detectives Zai Jiaju, Bao Detective Xu Dezhong, etc., to secretly go there the day before yesterday afternoon. They arrested nine members of the gang: Xu Genyuan, Xia A'mao, Shi Yinshan, Chen Bicai, Zhao Ziliang, Li Haosheng, Sun Kelang, and two women, Shi Wangshi and Sun Tongshi. It was later discovered that the occupants of room 122 of the hotel were also accomplices, so they also arrested Wang Guangcai, Wang Yunxiang, Zhou Liansheng, Zhou Baoxiang, Du Fuchang, Wang Zhengkai, Zhang Kunchang, and Yin Wenrong, bringing them back to the police station. Later, a fake handgun was seized from Zhao Ziliang's house at No. 50 Datong Road, Zhabei. Another fake handgun was seized from Zhao Ziliang's house at No. 15 Shenchang Lane, Wuzhen Road. A Mauser pistol and ten bullets were also seized from the house of the main culprit, Dong Yugui, at No. 15 Shenchang Lane, Wuzhen Road. Except for Dong, who was temporarily detained at the Public Security Bureau, the firearms were taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, requested that the suspects be detained for investigation of their crimes. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, it was ordered that they be detained in a prison for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Huang Zongxun Sued by Client – Accused of Receiving Litigation Fees but Not Handling the Case – Accused of Breach of Trust, Interrogation Ordered and Bail Posted</h3>
<p>Lawyer Huang Zongxun of No. 500 Sichuan Road was entrusted by Liang Zhixi, a Cantonese, in June last year to handle a case against a Norwegian merchant suing the Norwegian Consulate in Shanghai for owing 6,000 yuan in goods. At that time, a contract was signed, stipulating that Huang would receive 30% of the recovered amount as legal fees and compensation. Liang also provided an additional 50 yuan in cash for all expenses. However, after signing the contract, Huang Zongxun delayed initiating the lawsuit. Although Liang repeatedly urged him, Huang continued to make excuses. After more than half a year, Liang hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation against Huang Zongxun in the First Special District Court, accusing him of breach of trust and requesting legal punishment. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide summoned him for interrogation. After the plaintiff stated the grounds for the lawsuit, the defendant, Huang Zongxun, presented a paper in English claiming it was a contract signed with the plaintiff. He claimed that after being entrusted by the plaintiff, he needed to study the case, which caused delays. Furthermore, the plaintiff had not paid the litigation fees, so he was unable to file the lawsuit. Upon hearing Huang's statement, Liang immediately refuted it, saying that he did not understand English and that the English contract presented by the defendant was definitely not signed by him. He also stated that the 50 yuan previously given to Huang was for litigation expenses and requested a clear investigation. Judge Feng reviewed the statements and believed that Huang Zongxun, as a lawyer, had acted improperly. He ordered him to post a shop guarantee and adjourned the hearing for further investigation. Yu Xiangqin, the defending lawyer hired by Huang, requested that he be released on his guarantee, but the court rejected the request.</p>
<h3>Fishmonger's Credit House Robbed</h3>
<p>The Jiyi Credit House for fishmongers (where fishmongers receive credit slips to sell fish daily and pay their earnings in the evening) at No. 2 Zaoshun Street, Yikang Lane, Dajing Road in the city, was targeted by bandits due to the fishmongers paying their earnings in the evening. Around 6 PM the day before yesterday, just as the credit house was about to close accounts, five or six bandits suddenly appeared. Three of them, each holding a pistol, entered and warned people to remain silent, while the other two kept watch outside. They robbed over 1,100 yuan in cash from the counter and fled. Du A'dou, an employee of the credit house, secretly followed the bandits. However, as the police were far away, Du, regardless of his own safety, grabbed a bandit around the waist and shouted for help. Unexpectedly, the bandit, in desperation, fired a shot that pierced a hole in Du's hat, causing him to release his grip and the bandit escaped. Afterwards, Du reported the incident to the Laobeimen Police Station, requesting investigation and severe punishment.</p>

<h3>The Rongs Father and Son are Bitterly Estranged - The Father Requests Revocation of Inheritance Rights - Rong Shangqian and His Eldest Son Rong Peng are Incompatible - The Son Was Detained For Debt, and the Father Sues Him For Insult</h3>
<p>Rong Shangqian, a 71-year-old man from Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, resides in the Jing'an Villa on Jing'an Temple Road. He once served as a naval commander during the late Qing Dynasty. After the Republic, he was briefly appointed as the chief of car operations for the Jingfeng Railway in the 5th year of the Republic. Not long after, he resigned from his position and became a resident in Shanghai. His wife, Yu, came from a wealthy family, and her dowry reached 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Rong was also wealthy because of this. They had two sons, the elder named Rong Peng and the younger named Rong Hong. Rong Peng is now</p>
<p>of an age to understand destiny</p>
<p>and has two children. He currently lives at No. 42 Pi Street, Daxi Road. However, Rong Peng lost respect for his father after his mother passed away, leading to a complete breakdown in their relationship. Years ago, he sued his father, Rong Shangqian, in court in the name of the legal guardian of his children, vying for the family property. The initial trial resulted in a victory for him, but his father appealed and overturned the initial judgment, leaving him with nothing. Fortunately, Rong Peng was able to support himself by starting a stone company, dealing in various stone products, which was sufficient to maintain the livelihood of his wife and children. Unexpectedly, recently</p>
<p>the market has declined</p>
<p>and all industries are struggling in an atmosphere of economic downturn. Rong Peng was unable to sustain his business, accumulating heavy debts, which led to creditors suing him in the First Special District Court. Unable to repay the debts, he was detained by the court yesterday morning and is now in civil custody. His father, Rong Shangqian, has also sued Rong Peng in the First Special Court, claiming that Rong Peng has caused him significant insult and is requesting the revocation of his inheritance rights in accordance with civil law. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Peng ordered Rong Peng to be brought from the detention center for interrogation. The plaintiff was absent due to illness and was represented by a lawyer.</p>
<p>The defendant, Rong Peng,</p>
<p>testified that his father's time as an official was short and his pockets were empty. The property currently owned, which amounts to more than 400,000 yuan, originally belonged to his mother's family. The relationship between him and his father was originally good, but unexpectedly, after his mother passed away, on a certain day, he returned with his wife and children, but his father suddenly refused to allow him to enter the house. As far as he knew, his father was surrounded by female members of the family and servants who</p>
<p>believed in slanderous words.</p>
<p>Those currently living with his father, besides his younger brother Rong Hong and his family, are a group of women. He did not dare say whether his father had taken concubines. In the past, in order to protect his children, he filed a lawsuit, which he initially won but later lost. The shares of the China Business Company, which were contested, are still in his father's hands. The original value of those shares was more than 100,000 yuan, but currently, due to the decline in real estate, the company is in danger. The court then instructed him, "Your father believes you have caused him</p>
<p>significant insult,</p>
<p>so he does not want to divide the property with you, and he is now requesting the revocation of your inheritance rights. What is your opinion?" The defendant replied, "Now that I am a father myself, how could I be unfilial? I strongly oppose the plaintiff's request." The court then asked why the plaintiff was absent, and the plaintiff's lawyer stated that the plaintiff grew up in the United States, does not understand Chinese. Rong Peng claimed that his father had previously served as an official and had lived in the north for a long time, and he spoke fluent Mandarin. Judge Peng then ordered that the hearing be adjourned to January 28th in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>The Zhan Dao San Inheritance Dispute Case - Zhan Yun San and Others Granted Bail</h3>
<p>Zhan Dao San, the owner of the Zhan Da You Ink Shop on Fangbang Road in this city, from Huizhou, only had one daughter, who married Cha Qilin. They had three children. After Zhan Dao San passed away in the 18th year of the Republic, his inheritance amounted to more than 2 million gold. The full authority of the shop was under the management of his cousin, Zhan Songlin. Since then, lawsuits have been filed one after another. Last year, Zhan Yun San, Zhan Song San, and others, brothers of Zhan Dao San, petitioned the local court to order Zhan Songlin to submit accounts for verification. After three trials, it was ruled that he should submit them. On the other hand, Cha Qilin submitted a petition to the court requesting confirmation of his inheritance of all the assets of his father-in-law, Zhan Dao San. Zhan Yun San also presented a will written by Zhan Dao San in the 17th year of the Republic and a succession document written in the 14th year of the Republic, stating that Dao San had no male heirs and that his second son, Boqun, was established as his successor. The initial judgment ruled that the inheritance of Zhan Dao San should be divided equally between Cha Qilin and Zhan Boqun. Cha Qilin refused to accept this and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. Cha Qilin also accused Zhan Yun San and Zhan Song San of forgery of documents in the local court's prosecutor's office, forgery of seals, and Zhan Jixian, Yu Ruizhi, and others of forgery of documents and perjury. Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu investigated and requested the will and succession documents from the Jiangsu High Court for appraisal. He concluded that Zhan Yun San and others did have the crime of forging documents and filed a public prosecution in accordance with the law. Chief Criminal Judge Cai Dingcheng once summoned them for interrogation. The defendants did not attend due to illness, and it was ordered that they be summoned again. The details have been reported in the previous news. It is now learned that this case was continued to be heard by Judge Cai in the courtroom at 11:40 yesterday morning. First, Cha Qilin was summoned to the case and asked, "What evidence do you have that Zhan Yun San and others forged documents?" He replied, "Song San did not sign the succession document written in the 14th year of the Republic. There is a letter from Song San in Shanghai as evidence. The letter is now in the civil case file." He was asked, "Is there any other evidence?" He replied, "The seal on the will of the 17th year of the Republic is not the personal seal of my father-in-law. The will has been identified as forged." According to Yu Ruizhi's testimony, 41 years old, from Huizhou, residing in Yangshupu, "When Zhan Dao San was ill in the 17th year of the Republic, I visited him and a will was written, and I was instructed to sign it. As for the succession document written in the 14th year, I don't know about it." According to Zhan Song San's testimony, 32 years old, from Huizhou, residing at No. 222 Fangbang Road, "I signed the will written in November of the 17th year of the Republic. Yun San was in the room, as well as Yu Ruizhi. Both of them signed one after another." According to Zhan Yun San's testimony, 40 years old, "Dao San was my elder brother. Because he had no male descendants, he established my son Boqun as his successor in the succession document and will based on clan customs in the 14th and 17th years of the Republic. There was no forgery." Please investigate. The judge stated that the case still needed investigation and would be continued to be heard. The three defendants were ordered to provide guarantees from three reliable shops, with a joint and several guarantee deposit of 10,000 yuan. Without a guarantee, they would be detained.</p>

After receiving the report, the P'u T'uo Road Patrol Force specially removed the original patrol posts near the Suzhou Creek and dispatched a large number of plainclothes detectives to arrest the robbers when they tried to rob. The detectives of the patrol force who were waiting at the ferry included rickshaw pullers, rickshaw pullers, and three-wheeled cart pullers. The remaining Chinese and Western detectives were hiding in the Dongyang Textile Factory, etc. The Second Water Police Squad, led by Inspector Bao Renqi, disguised as boatmen and collected money, supported by Police Chief Xiao Shaohe, Police Officers Liu Zhushan, Liu Hongwen, Chen Yousan, and Song Deyun, etc. The Tanzhiwan Police Station, led by Inspector Long Jianpo, ambushed inside the Da Feng Textile Factory. The Xinza Gate Branch dispatched Patrol Chief Nie Dexiang, along with Police Officers Wang Yishun, Zhang Guangke, and Yu Changle, etc., to assist in the arrest inside and outside the Da Feng Textile Factory. Around 11:00 AM, the factory first used a car loaded with a fake wooden box, protected by bodyguards, to drive to the ferry. However, the plan was not secret, and the bandits had already learned of it and did not act. The detectives remained on guard until after 2:00 PM. When the factory transported banknotes across the river by car again, the bandits still did not dare to act, and the detectives dispersed and returned.</p>

<p>Zhang Wei, an elderly woman from Nanjing (51 years old), who resides at No. 178 Zhilan Lane, Kaizi'er Road in the French Concession, accuses her eldest son, Zhang Yonghai, 27 years old, of being a rogue. He was previously convicted for smoking opium and sentenced by the court. Recently, he was reported and arrested for stealing clothing from his uncle, Zhang Zaiming, and sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution, where he was sentenced to 40 days of detention, which he is currently serving. Now, his elderly mother, Zhang Wei, has filed a self-accusation with the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing Yonghai of showing a fake pistol to threaten her and injuring his 73-year-old grandmother, Zhang Zhang, requesting legal punishment to prevent future troubles. After reviewing the complaint, the court, represented by Judge Xiong Huiping, held a trial in the Second Criminal Division yesterday. The defendant, Zhang Yonghai, was brought from prison. First, the plaintiff, Zhang Wei, stated the grounds for the lawsuit, saying that her husband was also a civil servant in Japan, so he had passed away for six years. They had two sons in total. The younger son is 19 years old this year. The defendant is the eldest son. Since his father died, he has become even more of a rogue, smoking opium and gambling. He specializes in taking household items to smoke opium. When she objected and reprimanded him, he threatened her with a pistol. On February 19th of last year, he stole his uncle's clothing and threatened her with a pistol. When his grandmother tried to reason with him, he dared to become violent and injure his grandmother. She requested severe punishment to prevent future troubles and to avoid being harmed by him, etc. After finishing her statement, she presented a fake pistol as evidence. Then, the witness, Zhang Zaiming, testified that the plaintiff was his sister-in-law and the defendant was his nephew. He used to live separately at No. 229 Taoyuan Lane, Tilan Bridge, but has now moved back to live with his sister-in-law. The defendant stole his clothing this time, and he reported the case to the police for handling. He is usually restless at home. Li Zidong testified that the plaintiff was his mother-in-law and the defendant was his wife's younger brother. He had heard that the defendant beat and scolded his mother and grandmother at home, etc. Based on the testimony, the court questioned the defendant, Zhang Yonghai, who denied threatening his mother and injuring his grandmother. He had been prosecuted twice for opium cases and was convicted this time for theft. He did not have a fake pistol. They are actually trying to make his case more serious because he has a habit, so they are using this method to accuse him. He requested a clear investigation. After reviewing the testimony, the court rebuked the defendant, "If you were well-behaved, why would your mother falsely accuse you? It is clear that your usual behavior is terrible." The court announced the end of the debate and scheduled sentencing for the 18th. The defendant was returned to prison to continue serving his sentence.</p>
<h3>The Minhang National Exhibition Organized by the Factory Association Closed Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Minhang National Products Exhibition organized by the Shanghai China National Products Manufacturers Association closed yesterday after its grand opening on New Year's Day, with very prosperous business. Therefore, at 2:00 PM, a closing ceremony was held at the county's public education center, attended by 200 people including representatives from the county party headquarters, the county government, the county public security bureau, the county education bureau, the county public education center, the county women's association, and the citizens' association, such as Chen Jiufeng and Ge Futian. After Chairman Liu Zhongying presided over the ceremony, Chairman Liu Zhongying first reported that the association held the exhibition here on New Year's Day to promote domestic products, and was very grateful for the enthusiastic promotion and support from the business community during this period. It was originally intended to extend the period, but because the final accounting period was approaching soon, all factories had to prepare for the end of the year, making it difficult to fulfill the wish. Because Minhang is adjacent to the countryside, the people are simple and have become accustomed to it. They already have a deep understanding of domestic products and do not need further publicity and guidance. However, he hoped that all compatriots would continue their past achievements and work tirelessly, while expanding publicity to the outside world, so that the revival of domestic industry would be hopeful and the excess of foreign goods could be stopped. Then, Chen Jiufeng and others gave speeches (the full text is omitted). More than 20 manufacturers, including Taikang, etc., transported the remaining goods sold back to Shanghai in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>The Shelter Does Not Solicit Donations Externally</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Federation established a shelter at the Chaozhou Guild Hall and Chao Huishan Village in the southern city in December last year, sheltering poor people without clothes and food. Currently, there are more than 3,400 people, consuming more than 30 stones of rice per day. As the end of the year approaches and the weather is severe, with rain and snow, the shelter is even more crowded. In recent days, all sectors have generously donated to the charity's shelter in Renji Hall. Yesterday, with the assistance of Lu Bohong, the China Merchants Electric Company and the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company each donated 500 yuan, the Inland Tap Water Company donated 300 yuan, the Nan City Changtai Xie Wood Company and the Merchant Shipping Association each donated 100 yuan, and the Red Cross donated 500 yuan. Hearing that the leaders of various circles are so enthusiastic, Hua Ting's Fundraising Chairman Wang Yiting specially sent letters to thank them and will compile and print a report when the shelter closes, sending it to all circles to prove credibility. Director Zhang Zixin stated that the association will publish a notice in the newspaper regarding the impersonation of donations reported the day before yesterday. The Shanghai Charity Federation stated that it did not have a donation book for external fundraising. This month, the local news column of the Xin Shen and other newspapers reported that Song and others impersonated the association, printed donation books and seals, and solicited donations externally. They were arrested by the police and sent to court for questioning. The expenses of the shelter established by the association are entirely borne by donations from various charities and benefactors, and there is no donation book for external fundraising. It is hereby clarified for public information.</p>
<h3>The Author's Publishing House Sells an Engineering Masterpiece</h3>
<p>Our country's architectural studies have never had a dedicated book. Scholars of this field have always relied on original Western books from Europe and America. However, due to language barriers and differing national conditions, they are not only difficult to understand but also unsuitable for practical application. Now, Chen Zhaokun, a senior in the engineering field, drawing on more than ten years of architectural experience and spending three years, has compiled the book "Practical Architecture" by referring to hundreds of Western books. This is intended for engineers, surveyors, pattern makers, supervisors, and those interested in learning architecture. The book follows a progressive order based on the sequence of application in engineering and the difficulty of theoretical principles. Therefore, it is very suitable for vocational schools' civil engineering departments to adopt as a textbook. The content is divided into four sections, each in its own volume. The first volume covers mathematics, from basic arithmetic, approximations, comparisons, logarithms, geometry, trigonometry, slide rule usage, to the principles of mechanics. The second volume covers design, discussing force calculation and materials with simple metaphors, covering topics such as floor slabs, roofs, beams, steel reinforcement, concrete, wind force, snow pressure, resistance, stress, materials, dead load, wall footings, supports, I-beams, girders, railings, elevators, water tanks, water towers, high-rise buildings, structural layout, and drawing. The third volume covers calculations, including material estimation, determining the thickness of floor slabs, the spacing of railings, the composition of concrete, the size of beams and supports, I-beams, steel bar types, pile dimensions, large square footings, gutters, roof tiles, revetments, bridges, and all mechanical formulas. The fourth volume covers design implementation, meaning the schemes are based on specified building plans to facilitate the scholar's step-by-step learning using diagrams, such as residences, city buildings, bathrooms, revetments, hospitals, assembly halls, temples, etc., all of which are included. The formulas are clear, and the diagrams are explicit, quite effective in guiding and attracting readers. Currently, pre-orders have been open for more than three weeks, and over 700 copies have been ordered. The first to third volumes have already been published and can be collected immediately upon pre-ordering. Samples are available, and will be sent upon request. The fourth volume is scheduled to be published by the end of January of the 25th year (1936). Pre-orders will close soon, so don't miss the opportunity. The price of the book is ten yuan for the four-volume hardcover edition with leather binding and gold lettering, and eight yuan for the four-volume paperback edition. The pre-order price is seven yuan for hardcover and five yuan for paperback. An additional one yuan is charged for postage to other areas. It is exclusively sold by the Author's Publishing House on Fuzhou Road in Shanghai. All distribution matters have been contracted to the publishing house. Whether for industry colleagues, wholesale, retail, pre-order, or sample requests, contact the publishing house. The publishing house also sells the latest works, such as "Inflation and How to Deal with It" (translated and finalized by Fu Zhi, priced at 50 cents) and "Sugar Appraisal" (compiled by the Sugar Transportation and Sales Management Committee of the Ministry of Finance, priced at 50 cents), which are not easily found in the market and are new scientific publications suited to current needs.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: According to the person involved, Mr. Yu Zuotang, recently a certain Yu Yizeng, falsely claimed that his wife, Ms. Zhu, was pregnant and mistakenly took my prescription, and filed a criminal private prosecution against me in the Shanghai First Special District Local Court. At the initial court session, Mr. Xu did not appear. It was not until the continued hearing on the 11th of this month that Mr. Xu appeared in court. After examining the original prescription presented by him, I clearly noted in the pulse diagnosis that the words "ju jing" were written. The meaning of "ju jing" refers to pregnancy, which can be easily verified in medical books. The hemostatic and pregnancy-supporting medicines used in the prescription were all within the scope of the pulse diagnosis and were without error. The magistrate indicated that the articles of law cited by the plaintiff did not match, sufficient to show that Mr. Xu's claims were baseless. However, recently, after reading the news published in the "Shen Bao" and "Xinwen Bao" on January 12th of this year, all of them are one-sided accounts. The articles do not mention my statement that "ju jing" refers to pregnancy, and that the medicines used were for hemostasis and pregnancy support, which is clearly damaging to my reputation. In light of this, I hereby request you to correct the error expeditiously and publish this letter as soon as possible to dispel the misunderstanding. To the Shen Bao Editorial Department, Attorney Yuan Xilian.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Seasoning Powder Industry (Continued)</h3>
<p>— (A Summary of Shanghai Industry and Commerce, Part 9) Edited by China Credit Information</p>
<p>5.  Tiansheng Ziwei Su Factory - This factory was established in June of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), initiated by Lin Shuangquan, Li Tang, Li Zuyin, Cao Jiaru, and others. The initial scale was small, with a capital of only 28,000 yuan. Subsequently, it increased annually, and recently it was reorganized into a limited company, with the capital increased to 100,000 yuan. The manufacturing plant is located at Zhangjiazhai, Feihong Road, Hongzhen, and the distribution office is located at Sanheli, Xian Road. The factory rents land to build houses, with a base area of approximately 4.9 mu, with 30 to 40 factory buildings, equipped with four stoves, three motors, and machines for grinding, listening, and steaming powder. Its products are Ziwei Su (flavoring powder), and by-products are Ziwei Zhi (flavoring sauce) and Soy Sauce Essence, all using soybean and wheat as trademarks. Since its opening, it coincided with the decline of the market after the "January 28th Incident," and the business did not fully develop. However, it has since become active.</p>
<p>6.  Tian Yuan Jiu Ji Wei Su Factory - This factory was established in the 21st year of the Republic (1932), with a capital of 50,000 yuan, jointly operated by Sun Chengfu and others. The manager is Yang Bingxiang, and the factory director is Ding Guisheng, both of whom have invested capital. The factory was originally sole proprietorship, and was reorganized into a partnership in the 22nd year. The factory buildings are built on rented land, with six or seven bungalows, covering an area of approximately three mu, with an annual rent of over 1,000 yuan. There are two types of products in total: one is the "King Crown" brand Wei Wang (Flavor King), and the other is the "Lily" brand Wei Xian (Flavor Fresh). In recent years, due to prudent operation, it has shown improvement.</p>
<p>In addition to the above six factories, there are still two or three small factories in Shanghai, but they have little connection with the market.</p>
<p>3.  Raw Materials and Their Market Prices</p>
<p>The main raw materials for the seasoning powder industry are flour, hydrochloric acid, caustic soda, alcohol, charcoal powder, sodium sulfide, and soda ash. Most of the flour used is American flour, purchased through commission houses, because of its superior powder quality and viscosity compared to domestic products. Previously, all hydrochloric acid was Japanese goods, but since the opening of the Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant, most of them have switched to purchasing from this plant. Last year, the price of hydrochloric acid fell, with the lowest price of domestic goods dropping to 5.4 yuan. Since the implementation of the legal currency, the price has rebounded, with Japanese goods at 7 yuan and domestic goods at 6.5 yuan (both priced at 120 pounds per two cans). The selling price used to be around 15 yuan, but it plummeted to 5 yuan last year. It was not until the emergence of the new legal currency that it began to rebound. Alcohol used to come from Java, but since the emergence of domestic products from the China Alcohol Plant, fewer foreign goods are imported. Now, domestic products sell for over 1.1 yuan per gallon. Soda ash is mostly dependent on foreign goods. In the past, the United Kingdom occupied the top spot, but recently Japanese goods are imported the most, and the market price is also based on Japanese goods. Currently, the market price (priced at 200 pounds per bag) is 7.2 yuan for Japanese goods, 7.7 yuan for American goods, and only 7 yuan for domestic goods.</p>
<p>In addition, seasoning powder factories also need glass and tin cans to package the seasoning powder, so they are also auxiliary raw materials. Now, their types and prices are listed below for reference:</p>
<p>Note: Most of the tin cans are commissioned by the various factories to be manufactured by the Kangyuan Canning Factory.</p>
<p>4.  Sales Channels and Promotion Methods</p>
<p>Since the advent of seasoning powder, the Chinese people have been happy to purchase it because of its fresh taste and excellent quality. According to people in the industry, the total annual business volume of Shanghai factories in recent years is approximately 4 million yuan. In addition to being sold throughout the country, its products are also shipped to Southeast Asia and Hong Kong. Recently, some have also been shipped to the United States. Its sales channels cannot be said to be narrow. Because European and American countries do not yet have this type of product, if our country's manufacturers can unite and develop towards the international market, the future has great hope. The sales situation in various places is described below:</p>
<p>This Area - Seasoning powder is sold in all dry goods stores and grocery stores in this area. Products from various factories are available, but domestic goods are not sold very widely. It is said that the total annual sales volume is only about 400,000 to 500,000 yuan, because Japanese "Ajinomoto" still has the upper hand.</p>
<p>Other Areas - Among other areas, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Tianjin, and Hankou have the best sales volume. However, currently, due to the anti-Japanese goods movement in various places, they have all been suspended, and sales channels have been seized by Japanese goods again, especially in North China. Although the situation in Central China is relatively milder, sales have also decreased significantly due to economic decline and rural bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Foreign Countries - In foreign countries such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and Luzon, there are many overseas Chinese. Tianfu Factory and Tianyi Factory have successively promoted their products there, and the results have been excellent. Unexpectedly, in recent years, due to the decline of the rubber and tin mining industries in Southeast Asia, the purchasing power of overseas Chinese in general has also decreased sharply. At the same time, they have also been hit by Japanese merchants, and sales have decreased to 400,000 to 500,000 yuan, so the future is very bleak. In the United States, the Shanghai Huacha Company has recently promoted it, but sales channels have not yet been expanded (only over 100,000 yuan per year). Other countries have not yet adopted seasoning powder because they consider it unhygienic. There are generally two promotion methods: hiring street vendors to peddle to various stores, and entrusting commercial firms to manage the sales. The China Chemical Industry Society has established many branches and sales offices in other areas. In addition to the shops that sell on consignment in this area and other areas, the Tianyi Ajinomoto Factory also hires street vendors to promote its products. The Tiansheng Ziwei Su Factory entrusts the Guangdong Road Yuelai and Henan Road Chunyang dry goods stores to sell on consignment in this area. The Taiyi Wheat Essence Powder Factory mainly focuses on this area for sales and entrusts commercial firms for exclusive sales. These are the general promotion methods of the various factories.</p>
<p>When dry goods stores or grocery stores purchase flavoring powder from the factory, the factory generally gives a 20% commission. The same is true for other areas. As for the secret rebates in addition to the official commission, they vary from factory to factory. The four newly established factories, in order to promote sales, have larger secret rebates than the old factories. This is similar to the coupon promotions of various cigarettes.</p>
<p>5.  Price Fluctuations</p>
<p>Last year, the market price of flavoring powder was generally lower than the previous year. Fortunately, the market prices of various raw materials fell even more, so the various factories were not greatly affected. At the same time, since the promulgation of the new currency policy, the market price has turned upward again. If the general purchasing power can be maintained, the future of this industry is very promising. Now, the market prices before and after the legal currency policy are listed below for comparison for reference:</p>
<p>Note: Unit: one carton, each carton contains four cans, each can contains twenty taels.</p>
<p>"Note: According to the approval from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the former Beijing government, document number 1066, Tianchu was established earlier than Gentai, one in September of the twelfth year, and the other in November of the same year." (End)</p>

<p>Taihe defeated Nanyuan</p>
<p>The last match was between Taihe and Nanyuan. The strength of both teams was not weak. The Taihe team's forward was Yue Rui, while the Nanyuan team was defensive and impenetrable. Taihe's right forward, Huang Zhenquan, fought valiantly and was unstoppable, while Nanyuan's left guard, Wang Nianzu, was able to attack and defend, and his shots were accurate. In the first half, the two teams were evenly matched, each scoring 6 points. After halftime, the Taihe team launched another fierce attack, and the score increased steadily. The Nanyuan team's forward ability was weaker, and as a result, Taihe defeated the Nanyuan team by a score of 31 to 25.</p>

<h3>British Elementary School Physical Education Team Training Method (1)</h3>
<p>— Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>This article is written with reference to Chapter 2 of the "Detailed Syllabus of Physical Education Materials for British Elementary Schools" published by the British Ministry of Education. — Editor's Note</p>
<p>Team training involves dividing a class of children into several small teams based on their different interests or abilities, and providing appropriate training. In physical education activities, team training is a necessary training method. The need for team training can be proven by the following four reasons:</p>
<p>When there are many students in a class, teachers cannot attend to everyone and need team training. Physical education teachers often lead forty to fifty students in class. In crowded elementary schools, sometimes a class can have as many as sixty to seventy students. In such a large class, if the physical education teacher wants to train each student individually, it will not only waste the entire class's time but also affect the order of the class. Therefore, team training is essential.</p>
<p>Children have different interests and abilities, requiring team training. It is obvious that children have different interests. Children not only have different interests but also have differences in ability. Therefore, within a class of children, we can use team training according to their different interests and abilities to meet individual needs.</p>
<p>Mixed-gender education is inconvenient and requires team training. From a physiological development perspective, it is inconvenient for boys and girls to learn physical activities together. From a social perspective, boys and girls are often uncooperative in participating in physical activities together. Therefore, in schools with both boys and girls, team training is also advisable for physical activities.</p>
<p>Cultivating children's ability to cooperate and lead requires team training. The greatest result of team training lies in cultivating children's ability to cooperate and lead. Conversely, to cultivate children's ability to cooperate and lead, team training is necessary. How team training can cultivate children's ability to cooperate and lead will be discussed in later sections.</p>
<p>2.  The Purpose of Team Training</p>
<p>The purpose of team training is to train children to develop the ability to act independently, the habit of cooperation, and a sense of responsibility. When implementing this type of training, it is essential to ensure that each child clearly understands his or her personal responsibilities and the work that should be done. If each child can understand that he or she is cooperating to promote a rapid and efficient organization and that he or she is independently practicing to develop his or her performance ability, then there is a proper foundation.</p>
<p>3.  The Beginning of Team Training</p>
<p>Team training has been implemented in many parts of England for a long time and has been very effective. Based on past experience, if teachers can guide children toward a simple and specific goal and can avoid overly formal procedures, then team training can begin in the upper grades of elementary school. When implementing this type of training, it is important to avoid rigid imitation procedures. If children gain basic independent practice in elementary school, they will be able to develop the ability to practice independently to a greater extent when they reach middle school. For example, if a certain grade of children receives basic team training, in the future, when these children are learning to swim or play sports, they will be able to develop the ability to practice independently to a greater extent. They can leave the teacher and practice independently and can fully demonstrate their creative abilities and common sense. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Children's Educational Novel</p>
<h3>Little Boy (1) (5) (3)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>He looked up at her, a strange expression in his eyes, a mixture of pride, gratitude, and sorrow—she did not understand it then, but could never forget it afterwards.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid you'll be disappointed, but I'll always try my best," he said, closing the booklet, without any expression of joy, but this was the material he used to love to read and talk about most.</p>
<p>"Are you uncomfortable?" Mrs. Shu asked, placing a hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>"My feet hurt a little; I think I'll go to sleep. Goodbye, Mrs. Shu," he said again, supporting his cheek with that hand for a long time before walking away, as if he had said his last farewell to something he cherished.</p>
<p>"Poor Tang En! He feels deep sympathy for Naide's humiliation. He is a strange child; I wonder if I can fully understand him?" Mrs. Shu said to herself, recalling Tang En's recent progress, which was very satisfactory, but she felt that the child was not as ordinary as she had previously thought.</p>
<p>One thing that saddened Naide the most was Tao Mo's action because after the theft, Tao Mo said to him in a gentle but firm tone:</p>
<p>"I don't want to hurt your feelings, Naide, but you know I can't afford to lose money, so I don't think we can be partners anymore." After speaking, Tao Mo immediately erased the word "Company" from the sign.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Issues Order to Adopt Shuangqiu Popular Education Vehicle Issued by Shanghai Education Compilation and Translation Institute Pre-order Deadline is End of February</h3>
<p>Tai Shuangqiu, the dean of the College of Education at Great China University in this city, has been engaged in rural education, promoting the concept of combining labor and education, and advocating for people's livelihood education, which has attracted the attention of the national education community. Dr. Tai, noting that current education is costly and that its content is biased towards written instruction, making it a privilege for a small number of middle-class children, making it difficult to achieve popularization, invented a popular education vehicle with mobile properties and complex functions through several years of experimentation to remedy this shortcoming. Last November, Dr. Tai took the invention to Beijing for a public demonstration and requested the Ministry of Education to issue an order for its adoption. The Ministry of Education replied, "The vehicle is ingeniously constructed, with many teaching aids and items inside that can be converted and used in various ways, and it is very convenient to carry. It is truly a useful tool for popularizing compulsory education and promoting mass education. It can be ordered for adoption by educational institutions nationwide." It is reported that a patent has been applied for with the Ministry of Industry and is currently being sold and pre-ordered by the Shanghai Education Compilation and Translation Institute at 750 Route Cardinal Mercier. The pre-order price is only 85 yuan per vehicle, including more than 200 items of large and small supplies inside the vehicle. The pre-order period ends at the end of February this year. The institute also has a brochure detailing the structure, function, various components, supplies, and pre-order methods. Enclose one dime for postage and it will be sent for you to read.</p>

<h3>Further Discussion on the National Self-Awareness Movement</h3>
<p>— Ye Qing</p>
<p>So-called national self-awareness is a nation's self-recognition. Its occurrence follows the same two principles as our recognition of all things: Recognition comes after the existence of things; Recognition originates from the stimulation of things.</p>
<p>Because of the first principle, there is always a nation first in the world, and then there is national self-awareness. From a developmental perspective, the existence of a nation can be divided into two stages: a nation in itself and a self-aware nation. How do they shift? The key lies in the contradictions within the nation.</p>
<p>In an era where several nations coexist, the interests of one nation are often built on the seizure of the interests of other nations. And because of this, there are oppressed nations. They feel that they must resist oppression in order to survive. So they have to awaken the people in the nation to fight together. The call at this time is: We are oppressed by other nations, our nation must quickly wake up, unite!</p>
<p>Isn't this following the second principle of recognition?</p>
<p>Understanding this point, one can know why the national self-awareness movement in Europe appeared after Napoleon of France ravaged the various nations of Europe, and the nationalism in China appeared after the imperialisms of Europe, America, and Japan successively invaded China for decades.</p>
<p>Therefore, the national self-awareness movement is a struggle for survival that opposes aggressors in consciousness. Today, it is a cultural movement in colonies and semi-colonies that awakens people to oppose imperialism in order to achieve national liberation. Because today's aggressors are imperialists, and their colonies and semi-colonies are oppressed nations. So this movement is, of course, also a struggle for survival.</p>
<p>If we want to ask whether we still need this movement today, then we must ask whether we have been liberated from the oppression of imperialism. Everyone will answer this with a no. And in recent years, we have suffered even more serious aggression. Even the territorial and administrative integrity that the imperialists, who are devoted to economic exploitation, allow us cannot be guaranteed. The degree of aggression has indeed reached an unprecedented level!</p>
<p>In this situation, is there still no need to oppose imperialism? Doesn't opposing imperialism still require awakening the broad masses to create a whole force to realize the national revolution?</p>
<p>Therefore, the national self-awareness movement has reached an unprecedented level of need in the present. This is a struggle for survival, which every intellectual should participate in. Only by using the national revolution movement created by the national self-awareness movement to overthrow imperialism will we have the possibility of improvement in our material lives. Just think: If we don't overthrow imperialism, then unequal treaties cannot be abolished, lost land and rights cannot be recovered, and tariffs are not autonomous, the nascent national economy cannot be protected, and widespread unemployment cannot be relieved. What method can be used to make those who cannot live be able to live, and those who live the most miserable lives live better lives?</p>
<p>Of course, we not only have mouths and stomachs, but also senses and brains. So, in addition to material life, we also have to live a spiritual life, but how can we talk about spiritual life when we are afraid of not having enough to save the dying? If we want to get it, we can only start by opposing imperialism. And our very basic thing now—to get rid of the fate of slaves and the title of inferior races and gain equal personality among human beings. To make our spirits stretch a little, there is only one way: to oppose imperialism!</p>
<p>Want to live? Want to improve your life? Want to be human? There is only one answer to the question: Oppose imperialism. Otherwise, it is to be a slave, to be a fish, to be oppressed and slaughtered by imperialism. There is no third way.</p>
<p>Then strive for the national self-awareness movement! There is freedom, equality, and happiness waiting for us!</p>
<h3>Duke Huan of Qi and the Old Carpenter</h3>
<p>— Chuan Lin</p>
<p>—See "Heavenly Ways" (天道), Chapter 13 of the Outer Chapters of Zhuangzi (莊子)—</p>
<p>One morning, Duke Huan of Qi was in a good mood. He picked up a book and began to recite it aloud in the main hall.</p>
<p>The more he read, the more pleased he became, stroking his beard and shaking his head rhythmically, drawing out each phrase with a long, lingering tone.</p>
<p>In the courtyard below the main hall, the seventy-year-old carpenter Bian, holding a chisel (鏧子) in his left hand and an iron awl in his right, was energetically making a wheel. The rhythmic sound of the awl striking the wheel resonated in the air.</p>
<p>Suddenly, just as his chisel was about to strike, Duke Huan's grating recitation pierced his eardrums, disrupting the rhythm of his awl and chisel. He grimaced, and the chisel slipped on the wheel.</p>
<p>"Hmm?" He looked up and saw the Duke sitting solemnly, reading a book. He glanced at him and resumed his work.</p>
<p>"La... la..."... "La..." Duke Huan's recitation grew louder, like a swarm of bees buzzing in his ears. He felt a headache coming on and nearly slipped again on the wheel.</p>
<p>"Ugh!" He became impatient. He put down the awl and chisel, brushed off his clothes, and walked toward the main hall.</p>
<p>"Your Majesty!"</p>
<p>Duke Huan, engrossed in his reading, was displeased by the interruption and glared at him, asking, "What is it?"</p>
<p>"Your Majesty, what book are you reading?"</p>
<p>"Hmm?" Duke Huan thought, "What's this old man up to? Could it be that my recitation has moved him? Perhaps the words of the sages are indeed powerful." So, he cleared his throat and said loudly:</p>
<p>"This is a book by the sages!"</p>
<p>"Ha! Then where is the sage himself, Your Majesty?"</p>
<p>"The fool," Duke Huan chuckled. "The sage is long dead!" he replied loudly.</p>
<p>"Then..." the old carpenter Bian smiled and said, "Isn't Your Majesty reading the dregs of the ancients?"</p>
<p>"What nonsense!" This remark enraged the Duke. He slammed a wooden table and shouted sternly, "I am reading here, and you, a mere carpenter, dare to offer your opinion! Hmph! Speak if you have reason, or this old turtle will die immediately!" The Duke nearly jumped up.</p>
<p>The old carpenter bowed and said slowly, "I am a carpenter, so I shall speak of carpentry. When we make wheels, if we strike too slowly, the wheel will not be strong; if we strike too quickly, it will be rushed and incomplete. We must strike neither too fast nor too slow, with the heart and hand in harmony. But how to achieve this balance is not something that can be explained in words. There is a certain skill involved, which I cannot teach to my son, nor can my son learn from me. That is why, even at seventy, I am still chiseling wheels. Your Majesty, the people of the past are already dead, and the ways of the past cannot be passed down, or even if they are, the present is no longer the past. What use are they? You cannot turn the present into the past... Therefore, isn't what Your Majesty is reading the dregs of the ancients?"</p>
<p>"..." Duke Huan was speechless, staring blankly at him.</p>
<h3>On a Hundred Outstanding Works</h3>
<p>— Yao Hua</p>
<p>The magazine "Ren Jian Shi" (人間世), which has now ceased publication, called for nominations of a hundred outstanding works in its final issues. This matter attracted the attention of some people, and many famous scholars, writers, and literary figures nominated books they considered "outstanding." Some even provided short, introductory criticisms of the books they nominated, pointing out the true value of each book, hoping for a final decision from the "Ren Jian Shi" society. However, the "Ren Jian Shi" society has announced its closure, and this project has inevitably been shelved.</p>
<p>What benefits does compiling a book list have for readers? The answer to this question is truly not easy to say. Zhang Zhidong's (張之洞) "Booklist for Answering Questions" (書目答問) from the late Qing Dynasty is the elder statesman of booklists. Some people have found a path to studying national studies by reading it, while others have only heard many book titles after reading it, but have not bothered to read the recommended books, and therefore feel that it is like passing clouds, of no use. More recently, in the early years of the Republic of China, Mr. Liang Qichao (梁任公) and Mr. Hu Shih (胡適之) both compiled a booklist of national studies for students studying in the United States at Tsinghua School. But what was the result? Both Mr. Liang and Mr. Hu were inevitably too scholarly. The books listed would be more than enough to fill a small library of national studies, so how could students studying in the United States read them? However, in the eyes of those who specialize in national studies, it can indeed list the basic books for studying national studies, especially Mr. Liang's draft "Introduction to National Studies" and its reading methods, which detail where to read carefully, where to skim, where to read, where not to read, what reference books are available for which book, and what reading methods are available for which book. It is truly a treasure for those who study national studies. I myself have benefited from this booklist, so I feel that compiling a booklist is very useful for readers, assuming that the booklist is compiled properly.</p>
<p>If you think about it carefully, the benefits of a booklist for readers are many. First, it can prevent you from being deceived by booksellers. I know many young people whose motivation to buy books is due to the tempting advertisements of bookstores, but it is difficult to say whether the advertisements of bookstores are reliable. At the very least, they have hidden the disadvantages and only revealed the advantages. Therefore, a booklist can dispel the deception of booksellers. The second benefit is that it does not waste time reading bad or useless books, because there are no such books on the booklist. Third, because you have already made a choice before buying books, the books you buy all have considerable value, which of course can save money on buying books. Furthermore, because the selected books are all valuable and meaningful, it further increases the reader's interest in reading. This is the fourth benefit. The last point, and also the most important, is that it allows scholars to study the knowledge they need in the most proper way. Some may say that there is no so-called orthodox school in academia: the same is true of prescriptions for the diseases of the entire society. You cannot say that Sakyamuni's Buddhist philosophy is wrong and that Marx's socialism is correct, nor can you say that the guild social system is wrong and that the technocracy system is correct. They all have their own value. In the right circumstances, they can be completely correct, but in another situation, perhaps this prescription will be more harmful than beneficial to the disease. However, from the standpoint of studying knowledge, it is necessary to see good prescriptions, but it is also important to know about bad prescriptions, so that you do not prescribe bad prescriptions when you prescribe them yourself, which will have a great impact. This view is certainly correct. But you should know that a truly good book should not be biased. This book introduces a theory, and only introduces this theory. It wants to reveal the true face of what it introduces, rather than showing people a flowery disguise. So, whether it's guild society or technocracy, this book will show their original face, whether they have a cleft lip or a scabby head, allowing you to see it in its entirety. Such a book is naturally an outstanding work.</p>
<p>Since the benefits of a booklist are so many, and the criteria for outstanding books should be set relatively high, then the selection of a hundred outstanding works should not be done by a literary magazine like "Ren Jian Shi," but should be led by an organization that is responsible for promoting national culture, such as the Chinese Cultural Construction Association (中國文化建設協會), in order to produce a fair and accurate booklist.</p>
<p>I have a few more words to say about the selection. "Ren Jian Shi" magazine's call for a hundred outstanding works specified that they should be works from the past fifty years, which is very correct, because China's acceptance and absorption of Western culture has been in these fifty years. In other words, these past fifty years are a new stage in Chinese cultural history. The culture of this period is very different from that of previous periods. The "outstanding works" selected from this stage are of course the food that modern people need, but I think that the works before this period and the translated books of this period should also occupy a considerable position on this booklist, otherwise there should be another booklist of old books and a booklist of translated books, in order to be fair, because a culture does not come suddenly. The original culture, plus foreign factors, produces a new culture, so these three types of books must be taken into account by those who compile the booklist.</p>
<p>Secondly, assuming that the booklist has been compiled, I think that this booklist should not just be a booklist. It would be best to solicit public criticism of these hundred books from scholars and experts in the country, and then reconcile the opinions of the public, correcting the errors and revising the falsehoods, so that the selected books can truly be called "outstanding works." I think this kind of work should be a kind of favor for readers.</p>
<p>Some may say, after the hundred outstanding works are selected, are there no outstanding works outside of the hundred, and are there no outstanding works among the newly published books after the hundred? This is correct, because the booklist is dead, and the publishing industry is alive. New books are published almost every day, so wouldn't the selection of a hundred outstanding works be enough to hinder the growth of China's currently weak publishing industry? Actually, it's not, because the hundred outstanding works only refer to these hundred books as being the hundred best works at the time of selection. After the selection is announced, perhaps every year, or every half year, the organizing body can still select a number of new books or old books that have not been selected for the booklist—for example, ten books. Then these ten books can be considered the outstanding works of the year, just like the American film industry's annual selection of the top ten films, which is enough to encourage the film industry and is definitely not likely to hinder it. And China's publishing industry can of course consolidate its foundation and prevent it from withering away, so how can there be any possibility of damaging its life?</p>
<h3>Bookstore Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Li Hengzhi</p>
<p>9.  Book Prices</p>
<p>Book prices are also part of the business economics problem. There is no fixed standard for setting book prices, but the price levels of books published by new bookstores seem to be similar. The main factor determining the price of a book is cost; it seems that the managers of new bookstores pay little attention to the content. However, those who know they don't need it will not accept it even if it is given away, and those who need it will buy it even at a high price. Therefore, in addition to setting higher prices, other books seem to use the number of pages as the standard for pricing (binding and paper are naturally also related).</p>
<p>Generally speaking, book prices are mostly between four and five times the cost. For example, if the total cost of manuscript fees, printing fees, and paper fees for this book, calculated with a first edition of 2,000 copies, is 20 cents per copy, then the price is mostly around one yuan. If the book sells well and the price is not discounted, then the book business is really good. In the early days of the new book industry, new bookstores opened one after another for this reason. I remember that there were very few discounts at the time, and there were not many opportunities for cheap prices. At one time, because the price of paper rose, the new bookstores even came up with a "common agreement among the industry, adding one to the code," which shows how prosperous it was. The cheap prices of "all new books, half price" and "18% discount" that exist now, in the minds of readers at the time! They never thought there would be such a good opportunity.</p>
<p>Of course, book prices were high at the time, and the book industry was quite prosperous, but even with the current sales without discounts, the pure profit obtained by bookstores is not as much as we imagine. For example, a book priced at one yuan, except for a small number sold directly in the store, is wholesaled to peers at least at 30% off. When it comes time to collect payment, there is a rebate and discount, plus the interest on capital. The profit is probably only between 50 and 60 cents. Adding expenses, losses, and the unlimited increase in wealth-generating accounts mentioned in the previous section on "bookstore capital," the first edition of new books is often unprofitable. If royalties are drawn, it may even lose money. Publishing new books is similar to speculation, and not all of them are guaranteed to sell. If there are unsold books, the impact is even greater. What new bookstores expect is reprint books, but because the number of Chinese readers is fundamentally small, it is not easy to have sales of more than 10,000 copies for general reference books. Therefore, it is rare to see new bookstores that can develop successfully. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Introducing a Chinese Engineering and Literary Reference Book (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yi</p>
<p>This book is called "Chronological Table of Chinese Literature" (中國文學年表), compiled by Mr. Ao Shiying (敖士英), first published in early October of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), and only the first volume of four books has been published, issued by Lida Bookstore (立達書局) in Peiping (北平).</p>
<p>Mr. Ao explained his reasons for writing this book very clearly in his preface:</p>
<p>"The creation of chronological tables has been around for a long time. Sima Qian's (司馬遷) 'Historical Records' (史記) established ten tables. Wang Sengqian's (王僧虔) biography in the 'Book of Liang' (梁書) states that it runs obliquely upward, imitating the Zhou genealogy, which is also a legacy of the Three Dynasties. From Ban Gu (班固) and Fan Ye (范曄) onward, they are either complete or incomplete. Wan Sida (萬斯同) compiled 'Chronological Tables of Successive Dynasties' (歷代史表), based on the examples of Ma Qian (馬遷) and Ban Gu, supplementing the omissions. The use of chronological tables is therefore greatly enhanced. Furthermore, Wang Zhichu (王之樞) and others compiled 'Chronological Tables of Historical Events of Successive Dynasties' (歷代紀事年表), Qi Zhaonan (齊召南) compiled 'Chronological Tables of Emperors of Successive Dynasties' (歷代帝王年表), and Wu Rongguang (吳榮光) compiled 'Biographies of Famous People of Successive Dynasties' (歷代名人年譜), all based on the examples of official history and expanding upon them. Their benefit to those who read history is not insignificant. However, these only record people's names, or also record events. To speak of ancient scholarship today, the previous tables cannot fully cover it. This is why I created the 'Chronological Table of Literature'."</p>
<p>Therefore, his method of compiling this book is also different from other chronological tables. He divides the entire table into eight columns:</p>
<p>① Gregorian Calendar - This is the verification of the year. ② Dynasty and Emperor's Title - This is the verification of the Chinese year. ③ Summary of Current Events - This is an explanation of the historical background. ④ Author's Birth ⑤ Author's Death - These two columns verify the author's birth and death. ⑥ Author's Biography - This is an explanation of the author's life.</p>

<h3>A Review of Improved Foreign Trade</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>According to recent reports from customs, there is a very good sign for the future of domestic goods: the improvement of foreign trade and the sharp reduction in the trade deficit. According to his published statistics, the total value of foreign trade imports in the past ten months of last year was 781,550,545 yuan in national currency, a decrease of 92,563,484 yuan compared with 874,154,029 yuan in the same period last year. The total value of exports was 444,999,997 yuan, an increase of 2,134,147 yuan compared with 441,865,850 yuan in the same period last year. Judging from this, the significant decrease in the amount of imports and the slight increase in the amount of exports can indeed give great comfort to those of us who have been engaged in the national products movement for many years. Although my country's international trade is still in a deficit in its overall form, as long as we make greater efforts in the future based on this sign that foreign trade is gradually improving, we will definitely be able to enter a very good stage for the future of domestic goods.</p>
<p>However, we cannot be too optimistic about the decline in the trade deficit. We must know that the reason for the formation of the trade deficit is that exports and imports cannot be offset. Now, the numbers tell us that the quantity of imports has indeed decreased considerably, but the value of exports has increased too slightly. This sharp reduction in the trade deficit seems to indicate the extreme decline of my country's domestic economy and the weakening of the people's purchasing power, which is worthy of our attention. On the other hand, the two items of silk and tea, which have long been considered hopeless, have once again ranked first among exports in the statistics recently released by customs in the past ten months of last year. Silk and tea are the mainstays of my country's exports, and their return to an active state can also be regarded as a manifestation of the gradual restoration of foreign trade to normal.</p>
<p>Therefore, here, I want to point out that for the future development of domestic goods and the elimination of the trade deficit, we must also seek to develop foreign trade more. Recently, the Shanghai Chinese Industrial Foreign Trade Association (滬上中華工業國外貿易恊會) organized a foreign sales delegation and plans to first seize the Nanyang exhibition. This is a concrete manifestation of actively carrying out this new plan and the only way to open up foreign markets. I also have two deep prospects for the gradual improvement of foreign trade. The first is that my country's current exports are still mainly raw materials, and industrial manufactured products have not yet emerged. In the future, we must make the products of new mechanical industries have a foothold in overseas markets, to avoid being laughed at as merely a "raw material supplier." Second, at this time of intense world industrial competition, if we want to develop international trade, we must strive to improve old products and broadly investigate the needs of various countries to promote new export goods, so that technology can be improved, products can be exquisite, and manufacturing costs can be reduced, making sales easier.</p>
<p>In short, although my country's foreign trade has shown a slight improvement, my country cannot be too optimistic and must make greater efforts to achieve the fundamental elimination of the trade deficit.</p>
<p>A Word of Contribution</p>
<h3>Feelings on Arnold's Speech</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The sanctity of trademarks, the standardization of goods, do not forget rural sideline occupations, the greatness of honest service.</p>
<p>Mr. Arnold, the American Commercial Counselor in China for thirty years, attended a lecture by the China National Products Production and Sales Association (中華國貨產銷恊會) yesterday for about an hour and a half. He spoke eloquently and endlessly, contributing many words to the national products community. Summarizing his words, my feelings are as follows:</p>
<p>Hope to Pay Attention to Trademarks</p>
<p>A trademark is a symbol representing a commodity. I hope that domestic manufacturers will only set a trademark if they must, and once it is set, they must respect the reputation of this trademark. They must never be careless about their products. It must be known that it takes more than a day or two to gain people's trust in a trademark. Once trust is lost, no amount of power can recover it. Mr. Arnold's words are worthy of reflection.</p>
<p>Standardization of Goods</p>
<p>Any commodity should have a certain standard in terms of style, color, and material. No deception or difference is allowed. This is not only a matter of commercial ethics, but also has a great impact on the promotion of goods. This is a wake-up call given by Mr. Arnold to the domestic products community.</p>
<p>Do Not Forget Rural Sideline Occupations</p>
<p>Seven or eight out of ten Chinese farmers rely on handicrafts as their family sideline occupation. In the process of the development of mechanical industry, rural sideline occupations are a source of livelihood for farmers. The farmers' livelihoods must not be neglected. If we can give them technological improvement and promotional assistance, it will also be a subsidy for domestic products. For example, soy milk and milk have equal effects. We should not blindly Europeanize and abandon soy milk without considering it. It must be known that China has many wonderful things in terms of utensils, clothing, food, and housing that are far beyond the reach of imported goods. It depends on the Chinese people's good use and remembering.</p>
<p>Honest Service</p>
<p>Mr. Arnold once described an American successful entrepreneur who started a business with hundreds of dollars and accumulated tens of millions of dollars over decades. His business spread across the country. When asked about the reason for his success, he said that it was nothing more than "honest service, never changing throughout his life." With honesty and faith, and also holding on to thrift and simplicity, treating others with respect and reverence, and maintaining it with constancy, there is nothing in the world that will not be beneficial. Mr. Arnold said that if he waited another ten or twenty years and talked with everyone again, everyone's business would have progressed infinitely, ten times or a hundred times more than it is now, and they would all be successful entrepreneurs. This is not only a New Year's wish, but if we can broaden our horizons, seize the opportunity, serve society with honesty, and fight for our careers with struggle, things will definitely happen, and the reason is solid. Mr. Arnold's encouragement to industrialists can be said to be the ultimate. How should our industrialists work hard to advance and open up a way out, so as not to let down this old commercial official who has been in China for thirty years?</p>
<h3>Admonitions for Domestic Products</h3>
<p>— Xia Zhonghan</p>
<p>Since the opening of my country to foreign trade, the dominance of foreign goods has been a long-standing issue, and the huge trade deficits reported over the years are shocking. Although the call to promote domestic goods has been resounding lately, the dumping of foreign goods is even more prevalent than before. The reasons for the underdevelopment of domestic goods can be summarized in two points:</p>
<p>The goods produced are not of high quality, and therefore cannot be compared with foreign goods;</p>
<p>The goods produced have not been promoted as much as possible, so that the people can understand them.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, many domestic manufacturers are now researching and improving, so there is indeed a phenomenon of continuous and tireless improvement in their products. However, there is a lack of promotion. Therefore, there is now a mass-based pen company organized by domestic investors, the "National Travel Promotion Team," to spread the word widely, which is enough to make up for the lack of promotion of domestic goods. The promotion at Kai Ming Middle School (開明中學) in South Shanghai the other day resulted in students buying a large number of domestic fountain pens and ink, which shows the power of promotion.</p>
<p>The factory has "Ten Admonitions for Encouraging the Use of Domestic Products," which can serve as a motto for compatriots across the country. I will now record them here for everyone:</p>
<p>When you spend money, never forget to seek the interests of your own people;</p>
<p>When you buy foreign goods, never forget the poverty of your country; Your money should not be used to increase the wealth of other people; When you buy foreign goods, remember that domestic merchants and manufacturers are also eager for you to buy;</p>
<p>When writing Chinese characters, please use domestic ink and pens. When writing foreign characters, you must also use ink and pens made in your own country;</p>
<p>Even if domestic goods are not perfect, it is glorious for those who use them;</p>
<p>You must use patience to overcome the poor quality of domestic goods;</p>
<p>Do not use foreign food and clothing to defile your mouth, stomach, body, and mind;</p>
<p>Never think that using foreign goods is glorious;</p>
<p>Only when all Chinese people use domestic goods can the country become rich and strong and the people live in peace and happiness!</p>
<h3>A Record of the Jiangnan Paper Mill</h3>
<p>— Xiang Xian</p>
<p>It is a shame to say that almost all of the paper used for the newspapers and books we come into contact with every day is imported. According to the 22nd-year customs report, the total value of paper imports was 43,829,000 yuan, and the total value of paper imports in the 23rd year was 37,268,000 yuan. The huge amount of leakage is shocking. If this continues, how can we imagine the consequences? The domestic paper industry should catch up quickly, which is something that cannot be delayed!</p>
<p>Among the domestic paper manufacturers, the three factories of Tianzhang, Longzhang, and Jiangnan are the most prominent. Unfortunately, Tianzhang's business failed, and only Longzhang and Jiangnan are left. They are competing alone with imported goods, which is something we must pay attention to.</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Paper Mill (江南造紙廠) is located in the north of Caojiadu Creek (曹家渡浜) in this city, covering an area of 18 mu (畝). The capital is 1 million yuan. It has been established for ten years. The factory uses machines to make paper, and the equipment is very complete. It is now equipped with 100-foot and 65-foot Yuan Gang Yankee paper machines, two 12-foot-diameter high-pressure steam cooking balls, seven pulpers, two Lecauye boilers (providing steam for the entire factory), a 150-horsepower electric motor, sixteen motors of various sizes, and other machinery necessary for papermaking. There are also three artesian wells of various sizes that supply water to the entire factory. In terms of water sources, there are two large and small water filtration ponds and several clear water ponds. The water flow is clear and you can see the bottom. The factory also has a repair shop that specializes in carpentry, ironwork, and casting, so it does not need to rely on others. The factory buildings are very sturdy and beautiful, with sixteen factory buildings, divided into offices, material warehouses, raw material warehouses, pressing rooms, cooking rooms, pulping rooms, power rooms, and other twelve departments. The layout is well-organized and the management is simple.</p>
<p>The factory's products are mainly Chinese paper, and the purpose is to research and use machine methods to improve the quality of Chinese paper. The products include Jiangnan Lian Shi (江南連史), Jiangnan Mao Bian (江南毛邊), Hai Yue (海月), Chong Gong (重貢), Yu Kou (玉扣), and Imitation Song Paper (仿宋紙). Secondly, it also imitates the manufacturing method of Western paper to produce Lian Shi paper and Mao Bian paper suitable for writing with fountain pens, which is a paper quality that our country urgently needs. On this point, the factory's vision is very far-sighted.</p>
<p>The raw materials for papermaking at the Jiangnan Paper Mill can be said to be completely domestic. All of the paper's raw materials are made entirely from the reed pulp invented by the factory itself (reeds are produced in large quantities in eastern Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the Yangtze River area). Not only is the cost low, but it also recovers a lot of rights and interests. As for chemical products, they are purchased entirely from Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant (天原電化廠). The glue needed for papermaking is entirely made from elm wood and sunflower roots produced in Sichuan. These are all authentic domestic products.</p>
<h3>Liu Weifu's Invention: Construction of a Rice and Grain Separating Machine</h3>
<p>— Jing Renfang</p>
<p>Liu Weifu from Nanchang has recently invented a rice and grain separating machine. The machine's construction is divided into upper and lower sections. The upper section is a blower, modeled after the old-fashioned winnowing fan. The lower section, the sifting machine, is an inclined rotary sieve, with the sieve resting on a hollow circular cavity. The cavity's center is fitted with a shaft, which is attached to the two ends of the right-side frame. These ends are bent backwards, with the center of the bend aligned with the center of the horizontal wheel axle. This ensures the interlocking remains intact when the inclination is adjusted. The upper end of the column supports the sleeve of the sieve, with a 96-tooth gear on the sleeve, connected to the lower end of the sieve column by a spiral. This spiral is engaged to adjust the sieve's incline (from 30 degrees to 40 degrees of inclination). The shaft runs horizontally to the front, connected to two large and small pulley wheels, and one 48-tooth gear. The large pulley wheel has a diameter of 2.9 decimeters, and the belt connects to the engine, rotating forward at 110 revolutions per minute. The small pulley wheel has a diameter of 1.9 decimeters, and the belt drives the shaft wheel, which has a diameter of 1.3 decimeters, rotating at 160 revolutions per minute. The shaft enters the blower drum, which is fitted with six blades, generating wind. The 48-tooth gear directly drives the sieve, with the 96-tooth gear rotating counterclockwise to the right, at 55 revolutions per minute. The sieve's rotation and the fan's wind work in conjunction. The operation is quite agile and can separate rice and grain. The Industrial Technology Review Committee of the Ministry of Industry has reviewed and approved it, granting a five-year patent for the lower sieve machine section.</p>

<h3>Contributions to Paper Merchants in Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi Provinces (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>However, wood pulp is sold on credit by foreign firms, goods first, money later, allowing for 75 days of credit before payment. If it isn't sold, no money needs to be paid. Buying bamboo raw materials, on the other hand, requires money first, goods later, and upfront investment to place orders with villagers. Someone unfamiliar with the local area would hardly dare to do this business. Therefore, my idea is that paper merchants should directly place orders with mountain households. Once the raw paper material is produced, transportation costs can be reduced by two-thirds, and losses can be reduced. Instead of considering three loads as one, two and a half loads will suffice. Assuming the cost of raw materials is 2.5 yuan, then two and a half loads would be no more than 6.25 yuan. Originally, three loads were considered one, with freight costs amounting to 1.5 yuan. Now, only 0.5 yuan is needed. In total, it would not exceed 8 yuan, which translates to about 134.4 yuan per ton. The labor cost for making paper pulp is four-fifths less than making paper. Let's assume the labor cost for each load of paper is 0.4 yuan, then it would be no more than 6.72 yuan per ton. The total cost would not exceed 140 yuan. Entrusting the paper mill to produce rough-edged paper would yield about 70 reams per ton, meaning the raw material cost per ream would be no more than 2 yuan. If we give the paper mill 1 yuan per ream for labor, then the transportation, labor, and raw material cost would be no more than 3 yuan. Assuming each ream of paper pulp costs 0.1 yuan, and 100 tons of raw material are handled each month, yielding 7,000 reams of paper, then there would be over 20,000 yuan of business to be done each month. Earning 8,000 to 9,000 yuan a year would be quite stable. Paper mills should transform into rice mills. It wouldn't be that they help rice merchants mill Chinese rice. Would they go and buy foreign rice with shells to mill? Therefore, the advertisements and appeals of the paper merchants in the three provinces published in Shen Xin's two newspapers, I say, are useless. Unless this plan of mine is followed, with paper merchants taking this main road, any other method of promotion, encouraging the use of handmade paper to save the rural areas, is truly empty talk and fantasy. As for providing capital, capital is already provided to the "trough households." Now, by switching to paper pulp, the output can increase fivefold, and the paper can be produced quickly, making turnover easier. As long as a decision is made early, one or two months before the Lesser Fullness solar term, to take this path, a year's plan can be made in spring, and time should not be missed. If this can be implemented, then 40 million yuan of paper imports can be recovered in a year. For example, in a besieged city, as long as someone bravely takes the lead and breaks a path to survival, others will naturally follow quickly, without needing to be invited or persuaded. Anyone seeking survival will naturally walk the path to life and will not sit idly and await death. The paper merchants of the three provinces have guarded their businesses for generations, relying on the blessings of their ancestors and enjoying the existing world. Now, at this time of crisis, if they do not consider the unemployed masses, wouldn't they consider their descendants? Abandoning the existing familiar path and trying to find another path, competing for territory with others, is not as easy as defending to attack.</p>

<h3>Interview with Ms. Feng Huizhen, Chairman of the Shaanxi National Product Wearing Group</h3>
<p>— Tianran</p>
<p>35,000 members unanimously swore: Those who do not use national products are not virtuous wives and good mothers. Women promoting national products have the greatest effect.</p>
<p>One morning, I visited Ms. Feng Huizhen, Chairman of the Shaanxi National Product Wearing Group, at the lodge. Ms. Feng is the wife of Mr. Zhang Yunqing, director of the Xi'an China National Products Company. She is about thirty years old, with clear speech and a graceful demeanor. Although she is from Changzhou, she speaks Mandarin quite well. Ms. Feng said that although it is inland, in recent years, people's habits have become increasingly extravagant, and the intrusion of foreign goods has increased annually, especially among women. Comrades in Xi'an are deeply worried about this. Therefore, they jointly launched this National Product Wearing Group with the wives of local officials and leaders from all walks of life. The chairman and the wives of the directors are all members of the executive and supervisory committees of this association, enthusiastically supporting it. In half a year, more than 35,000 people have joined this group. When each person joins the group, they must personally write a pledge, vowing not to use foreign goods. The group also provides a national product purchase certificate, and those who purchase national products at national product companies or shops can enjoy preferential rights. Therefore, daughters of prominent families, young people in schools, and people in industry and commerce have all actively participated. The speed of the group's development is unmatched by any other public group. Anyone who gathers ten or more comrades can establish a branch group, report to the general group, and be registered. The order of writing is not charged any fees to prevent malpractice. I deeply believe that women have a great responsibility in promoting and using national products, so I tirelessly engage in advocacy and persuasion, striving to make it the duty of everyone in Xi'an to use national products. From now on, if national products are not used for clothing, food, and handling weddings, everyone will consider it a great shame. Everyone takes pride in using national products. If a housewife does not make it her duty to use national products, she will lose her qualifications as a virtuous wife and good mother. Shaanxi has a total of ninety-two counties. Now, we plan to start from Xi'an and gradually extend it to the inland counties, striving to spread the grand wish of using national products throughout Shaanxi. I believe that the mobilization of women is the most effective way to promote national products. I hope that the women's community in Shanghai will also rise up and form similar organizations to serve as a guide for the inland areas. Currently, promoting national products should focus on inland work, because farmers in the inland account for the majority of the national population. Therefore, I hope that comrades who promote national products will put more effort into the inland areas. I am willing to follow the enthusiastic men and women across the country, doing my best, so that the words "trade deficit" will no longer exist in the minds of the Chinese people, and our national industry may have a day of revival. Ms. Feng graduated from Nanjing Women's Normal School and has served as a teacher at women's schools in Jiading, Suzhou.

<h3>National Unity and Telecommunications Unity</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's New Year's address to the nation was broadcast by the Nanjing Central Broadcasting Station. Throughout the country, regardless of remote rural areas, anyone with a suitable radio receiver could listen. This demonstrates that the function of broadcasting is truly a powerful tool for promoting politics. Leaders of European and American countries always deliver speeches when they have major plans and decisions that must be announced to the public. They use the power of broadcasting and telecommunications to convey their message to the entire nation, gain their sympathy, and obtain their understanding, thereby creating a united national action. This is how they achieve sincere unity and jointly overcome national difficulties.</p>
<p>Although broadcasting does indeed help national unity, broadcasting can only develop if the unity of the entire telecommunications industry is promoted. Broadcasting is just one part of the telecommunications industry. If the entire industry cannot be unified, then broadcasting cannot develop alone. Because broadcast radios must be registered with the telecommunications authorities before they can be installed. If the said agency is not under the jurisdiction of the central government, it will not issue a registration certificate and will not allow registration, or it will restrict the content of the equipment. Even if there are central broadcasting waves, it will be impossible to receive them. Therefore, telecommunications sovereignty is one of the national administrative powers. If the said sovereignty is damaged, then the national administrative power is damaged. How can we talk about national unity?</p>
<p>Since the completion of the Northern Expedition in the 17th year of the Republic, the country has declared its unity. However, due to various factors, the central administrative power has not been able to be exercised throughout the country. Last year, the military campaign to suppress bandits was completed, and the politics of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces have returned to normalcy. The party and government leaders of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces also traveled to Beijing together last November to participate in the Fifth National Congress. The telecommunications agencies of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces are also becoming closer to the central competent authorities. The Tianjin and Beijing telecommunications bureaus have long been directly under the central government, so there is no need to mention them. Therefore, from the national perspective, we use political power to promote national unity; from the telecommunications perspective, we use national power to consolidate telecommunications unity. This phenomenon is what a modern country should have, and it is what the people of the whole country deeply pray for.</p>
<p>Therefore, telecommunications sovereignty cannot be divided, nor can it be ceded. It is one of the conditions for the constitution of a country, along with land and people. If it is divided or ceded, then the country's nervous system will be destroyed, and all aspects of military, transportation, political, and cultural affairs will be affected. How can those who plan for the country ignore this?</p>
<h3>Talking about Methods for Compiling Telegraph Codes</h3>
<p>— Qinghua</p>
<p>There are two purposes for compiling telegraph codes: one is to keep secrets, and the other is to save telegraph fees. The code telegrams sent by party, government, and military agencies and private individuals aim to keep the content of the telegram secret, so they mostly use Chinese codes, which are codes composed of four digits, each code replacing one character. Except for official military code telegrams, which are specially allowed to have the same price as clear text, the remaining ordinary, urgent, and other code telegrams are charged double the ordinary clear text price, so they are very uneconomical in terms of telegraph fees. The code telegrams sent by commercial firms aim to save telegraph fees, so they mostly use Western codes, which are codes composed of five Western letters, each code can replace a sentence or several characters, which can not only save telegraph fees several times over, but also keep the content of the telegram secret, which can be said to be killing two birds with one stone!</p>
<p>Here, let's first talk about the method of compiling Chinese codes: The method of compiling Chinese codes is very simple. Just buy a newly compiled edition of the clear and code telegraph codebook from the telegraph office. The top and side of the code section of the book are printed with ten spaces each. The ten spaces at the top are called horizontal row spaces, and the ten spaces on the side are called vertical row spaces. Each space in the horizontal and vertical rows should be filled with a digit. The digits filled in the ten spaces cannot be the same, but the order of priority can be reversed, such as 4937502816. After the two rows of codes are filled in properly, then write two digits on each page of the book corner, such as 25, 47, etc. (referred to as corner codes). However, the digits filled in each page cannot be the same, and the order is not limited, but if you want to save trouble, then it is okay to write them in order. After filling them in according to the above, a codebook is considered successful. Just define a name for the code on the cover of the codebook, such as "National Code," "People's Code," etc., and add a note "Vertical first, then horizontal" or "Horizontal first, then vertical," and it's done.</p>
<p>When the telegram to be sent is translated into code, first find the location of a certain character, and take the two digits on the corner of that page as the thousands and hundreds of digits of the code (assuming the two digits are 25), then look at a digit in the horizontal row space at the top corresponding to that character, as the tens digit of the code (assuming it is 9), and then look at a digit in the vertical row space corresponding to that character, as the units digit of the code (assuming it is 8), then the code for that character is 2589. This method is called the "horizontal first, then vertical" method, because the digit in the horizontal row space comes first, and the digit in the vertical row space comes later. Conversely, if the code becomes 2598, then it is the "vertical first, then horizontal" method.</p>
<p>Translating received code telegrams is more difficult than translating telegrams to be sent, because most codebooks do not list the two codes written on the corner of each page in sequence. For example, the first page has the two codes 32, and the second page has the two codes 74. If the order is reversed like this, it is very troublesome to know which page a certain code is on. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications' newly compiled edition of the codebook specially adds a "Clear and Code Comparison Index Table." On this table, the first two codes of the original clear text on each page are pre-filled in contrast with the two codes written on the corner. When translating incoming telegrams, you only need to consult this table to know which page a certain code is on, which can save a lot of time.</p>
<p>The method of compiling codes described above is the simplest and most common method. We often hear people say that someone has the special ability to deduce codes, or that someone can find a way to translate any code. In fact, those people can at most deduce the most commonly compiled codes, because everyone used to compile codes without much attention. For example, the horizontal and vertical rows of codes on each page are all compiled the same, and the two codes compiled on the corner are all listed in order. For example, the first page is compiled with 25, and the second page is compiled with 26. And using codebooks printed and sold by ordinary bookstores, a group of experts who are familiar with codes will gradually deduce the commonly used characters at the beginning and end of the telegram. As long as they deduce a few commonly used characters, they will be able to calculate the horizontal and vertical row codes and the corner codes. If the horizontal and vertical row codes on each page are compiled differently, and the corner codes are reversed and not in order, then even code experts will be helpless.</p>
<h3>Improvements in the Method of Paying Telephone Rental Fees and Security Deposits</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Telephones were originally designed to facilitate communication, so their purpose is to find ways to provide users with the highest level of convenience. The so-called highest level of convenience has two meanings: first, to provide users with the best service technically; second, to provide users with the lightest burden in terms of cost. In recent years, the Ministry of Communications has been striving to innovate and rectify the telephone business, sparing no effort, and proceeding based on these two principles. As an example of the former, such as the inspection and repair of lines, the maintenance of equipment, and the use of new equipment, anyone who uses the telephone can point out that today's telephone has made great progress compared to the past. As an example of the latter, the monthly telephone rentals, installation fees, and removal fees of the telephone bureaus under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications have mostly been reduced, and the security deposit, which originally required a prepayment of 60 or 70 yuan, has now been reduced to 20 or 30 yuan, or at most 50 yuan. In addition, those who have installed both a main phone and an extension phone only need to pay the security deposit for the main phone. All of these measures reduce the burden on users and increase the convenience of use.</p>
<p>However, what some users still find slightly difficult is the issue of paying security deposits. The meaning of a security deposit is originally to guarantee the payment of monthly rental fees, compensation for equipment damage, etc., which is indeed necessary in practice. However, because users have to pay installation fees when installing a telephone, and they also have to pay a security deposit, in this year of economic recession, it is inevitable that they will have difficulty paying all of it at once. Therefore, there are often some people who need a telephone who hesitate to install it for this reason. This situation not only affects the development of the telephone business itself, but also fails to fully realize the purpose of convenience for the public. Recently, the Ministry of Communications, in view of this, has specially formulated a method for users to pay security deposits and rental fees in installments, in order to implement the purpose of the highest level of convenience. It stipulates that the security deposit that users should prepay for installing telephone equipment can be paid in installments within one year, so that users have a flexible way to pay, and they do not necessarily have to pay it all at once. However, a slight handling fee is charged. Those who pay in installments within six months will be charged an additional 5%, and those who pay in installments within one year will be charged an additional 10%, in order to show the restrictions.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are also some users who, for the sake of convenience, often prepay rental fees for a quarter or even a year. Although this kind of prepayment of rental fees is voluntary on the part of users for the sake of convenience, there is usually interest to be earned in the market. The Ministry of Communications, in order to show preferential treatment to these users, specially stipulates in the aforementioned method that users who prepay rental fees can slightly reduce the rental fees, in order to be fair. The amount of the reduction is stipulated as follows: Those who prepay for one quarter will receive a reduction of 1%; Those who prepay for two quarters will receive a reduction of 2%; Those who prepay for three quarters will receive a reduction of 3%; Those who prepay for one year will receive a reduction of 4%.</p>
<p>This method provides convenience for those who are temporarily unable to pay the full security deposit on the one hand, and at the same time, it does not neglect the interests of those who prepay rental fees on the other hand. The method is good and the intention is beautiful, and it is also one of the greatest improvements in telecommunications administration in recent years.</p>
<h3>Long-Distance Telephone Calling Instructions</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Anyone who has installed a local telephone only needs to prepay a long-distance telephone security deposit to the telephone bureau, or apply for long-distance telephone registration with the telephone bureau (the method varies depending on local conditions, but the security deposit can still be refunded when the long-distance telephone service is terminated). Then they can make long-distance calls on their own telephone. When making a call, first connect to the long-distance operator of the telephone bureau. After connecting, then report the location you want to call, whether the person receiving the call has a telephone, or whether someone needs to be sent to call them, and then state the telephone number or name and address of the person receiving the call. The telephone bureau operator will record each of the above items one by one. This procedure is called "registration."</p>
<p>After the operator has finished recording, if the long-distance line is currently in use, or if there are already several registered users before a certain registration, then the caller must put down the receiver and wait quietly for a while. When it is their turn, the operator will notify them. Therefore, it is often necessary to wait for some time after registering. However, callers who do not understand this reason often misunderstand, thinking that the operator is slack in their work and unwilling to connect the line quickly. These urges and questions are difficult to take effect due to the facts. If the caller really wants to speed things up and is impatient, they can pay double the fee and switch to making an urgent call. Then they can talk earlier. However, if there are several urgent calls at the same time, then the caller who called later still has to wait a moment. In short, the telephone bureau connects long-distance calls in the order of registration and the type of call. They will never intentionally delay.</p>
<p>The above are the procedures for making long-distance calls for those who have installed a local telephone. Those who have not installed a local telephone, or who have installed a telephone but have not applied for long-distance telephone registration procedures with the telephone bureau, only need to go to the long-distance telephone retail outlets set up in the telephone bureau, telegraph bureau, or various telegraph receiving and dispatching offices to make long-distance calls. Someone there will tell you how to make the call. The time for each long-distance call is stipulated as three minutes. After three minutes, it is counted as two calls, and it cannot be connected three times in a row at most. The call time is recorded by the telephone bureau or retail outlet staff, and when three minutes are up, they will notify the caller to stop talking. If the caller's speech has not yet ended, they should tell the operator that they want to continue for one more call. As for paying long-distance telephone charges, those who have paid a security deposit or have registered will be notified by the telephone bureau at the end of each month to pay the bill. Those who make zero-hour calls must pay as they go. The telephone bureau or retail outlet will give a receipt. When the caller receives the receipt, they should verify whether the fee paid matches the amount stated on the receipt. The price list for long-distance telephone calls to various places is also posted there for reference.</p>
<p>The procedures for making long-distance calls have been briefly described above. Now, let's write down the various types and properties of long-distance calls:</p>
<p>Ordinary Calls: Connected in the order in which the caller registered. This type of call often cannot be connected immediately, because there are often many registrations that have already been made earlier, so it is inevitable that you will have to wait a moment. However, the price is the lowest.</p>
<p>Urgent Calls: If you want to talk to the other party immediately due to special urgent matters, then this type of call is the most suitable, because it can be connected before ordinary calls. When making the call, you only need to state that you want to make an urgent call, and it can be processed accordingly. The call fee is charged double the ordinary call fee.</p>
<p>Call Notification: If the place you are calling does not have a local telephone, or if there is a local telephone but the person you want to talk to does not have a telephone installed, then the telephone bureau has to send someone to call the person you want to talk to to the telephone bureau to answer the call. This is called call notification. In addition to the ordinary or urgent call fee, a labor fee must also be charged separately. The labor fee is 10 cents for those within five kilometers. For those beyond one kilometer, we will not call for the time being. If the address stated by the caller is incorrect, resulting in no way to call, or if the other party refuses to answer the call after someone is sent to notify them, then the labor fee charged will not be refunded, and one-third of the ordinary call fee will be charged as a cancellation fee. The same applies if the caller registers and then requests to cancel the call temporarily.</p>
<p>Advance Notification: If the caller wants to talk to a specific person (that is, it must be this person), then they have to make an advance notification call. Its nature is similar to call notification, but it specifies that it must be a certain person. The call fee is charged according to the ordinary call fee, and then one-third of the ordinary call fee must be charged additionally.</p>
<p>For all of the above types of calls, if there is a temporary failure of equipment or lines after registration, resulting in the caller not being able to make the call, then all the fees paid will be fully refunded. Also, the labor fee and advance notification fee are charged at the ordinary price, whether it is an urgent call or an ordinary call, and there is no provision for doubling the fee.</p>
<h3>The Significance of the Ministry of Transportation's Regulation of Private Telephone Businesses</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Hoping that all commercial telephone companies will promptly apply for registration</p>
<p>Telephone communication is a public utility, and its quality directly affects public welfare. Therefore, the National Government's Regulations on the Supervision of Private Public Utilities clearly stipulate that private telephones should be under the supervision of the central competent authority to prevent manipulation by private enterprises and to standardize telephone engineering and operations to meet regulations, ensuring satisfactory service for the public. However, in recent years, although a considerable number of domestic commercial telephone companies have been approved for registration, the Ministry of Transportation, in order to regulate domestic telecommunications, cannot allow telephone services related to national transportation to be operated by private individuals without government supervision. Strict measures are therefore inevitable. As a reporter, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss several points for the attention of commercial telephone companies and those concerned with telecommunications.</p>
<p>The installation of telephone lines, the installation of machinery, and the supply of electricity are all related to technical issues. They cannot be hastily undertaken by those without knowledge or skill. Expert design and guidance are necessary to meet required standards, ensuring smooth telephone communication. The Ministry of Transportation first sends personnel to inspect private telephone companies to ensure that there are no engineering deficiencies before approving registration. Therefore, private telephone companies that have been approved for registration have reliable assurance of technical engineering quality. This is the first point.</p>
<p>According to Article 13 of the Regulations on the Supervision of Private Public Utilities: "If the nature of a private public utility is such that it is not suitable for concurrent operation within the same area, no second public utility of the same type may be established in the same operating area unless it is determined that the equipment of the original business is truly unable to be expanded to meet public needs." According to this interpretation, once a commercial telephone company has been approved for registration by the Ministry of Transportation, its business can be guaranteed a monopoly unless its own equipment cannot be further expanded to meet public needs. This is the second point.</p>
<p>The trend of modern telephone services is long-distance communication. To adapt to this trend in our country, there has recently been construction of inter-provincial long-distance telephone lines. The use of intra-city telephones is limited to communication within a single area. To develop business, it is necessary to connect to long-distance telephone lines and communicate with other cities. To expand domestic telephone communication, the Ministry of Transportation has recently been actively promoting the signing of connection contracts with various commercial intra-city telephone companies. All commercial telephone companies that have been registered will be able to enjoy the right to expand their business. This is the third point.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that the purpose of the Ministry of Transportation's supervision of private telephone businesses is purely active support, not passive suppression. All commercial telephone companies that have not been registered should understand this significance and promptly apply for registration to avoid losing the above-mentioned rights.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we would like to add that telephone service is a tool for public communication and a valuable means of transmitting information. Therefore, it has a significant impact on the interests of the nation and the people. According to Article 9 of the Regulations on the Supervision of Private Public Utilities: "If the annual net profit of a private public utility reaches 25% of the total paid-up capital, it shall reduce fees or expand equipment in the following year." Article 11 stipulates that "Private public utilities may not add foreign shares or borrow foreign debt." Therefore, those concerned with telecommunications should uphold the principle of cooperation between the government and the people and report unregistered private telephone companies as much as possible, fulfilling their national duty.</p>
<h3>A Critical Review of the Ministry of Transportation's Measures for Recruiting Wireless Telegraph Operators</h3>
<p>— Song</p>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation has formulated Provisional Measures for Recruiting Wireless Telegraph Operators to openly recruit wireless telegraph operators. It was promulgated on November 20 of last year, instructing all bureaus to comply when wireless telegraph operators are needed. The advantages of these measures are as follows:</p>
<p>Promoting the Examination System: The integrity of politics requires the selection of talented individuals, and the advancement and retreat of talent are best determined through examinations. This is why the Premier stipulated that the power of examination is one of the five powers of the constitution. In recent years, the examination rules for various personnel have been formulated by the Examination Yuan. However, when our wireless telegraph personnel want to contribute their abilities, they mostly request to serve at any time. Although examinations are conducted within the bureaus, the examination methods do not have a fixed standard and scope, and they are not yet perfect. Now that recruitment measures have been formulated, it is helpful to promote the examination system.</p>
<p>Equal Opportunity for Candidates: In the past, without examination measures, those who wished to apply but were unaware of the application procedures suffered from a lack of access, and opportunities were very unequal. Now, Article 1 of the measures states: "When the various telecommunications bureaus and stations under the Ministry of Transportation have vacancies for wireless telegraph operators, the Ministry will designate bureaus and stations to advertise and recruit." Article 2 states: "Anyone who wishes to apply should register and take the examination when the bureaus and stations advertise. Those who submit requests to the Ministry at any time will not be considered." This completely closes the avenue for personal requests, so that scholars have no fear of being abandoned, and people have no desire for fortunate advancement. In addition, examination matters are handled by an examination committee. Anyone with the knowledge and skills of a wireless telegraph operator does not have to worry about having no way out.</p>
<p>Raising the Level of Admission: Regarding the standard of qualifications for candidates, Article 3, Section 3 of the measures stipulates: "Those who have graduated from a wireless telegraph training school approved by the high school or transportation examination and have certificates to prove it." Regarding the standard of knowledge, Article 4 stipulates: "The examination subjects are divided into: Party Principles, Chinese Language, English Language, Electrical Engineering, and Telegraph Regulations." Regarding the standard of skills, Article 5 stipulates: "Receiving and sending messages at a speed of 20 Chinese characters per minute with 4 codes per character and 16 foreign characters per minute with 5 codes per character, with a total error rate of no more than 5% for both receiving and sending." Those who are admitted must meet the above standards at least, so the level is uniform and the efficiency of communication is increased.</p>
<p>The above three points are all advantages of these measures. Anyone who wants to apply to be a wireless telegraph operator must have the knowledge stipulated in the measures to be admitted. To have the knowledge to apply, one must enter a wireless telegraph training school approved by the Ministry of Transportation to obtain it. This is the way to learn what you use and use your talents to the fullest.</p>
<h3>The Writing Format and Charging Method for Parentheses in Chinese Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Zhongxian</p>
<p>Parentheses are widely used in Chinese telegrams. Here are some common examples: Used to write house numbers in the recipient's address, such as "Nanjing Zhongshan North Road (1105) 号"; used to write post office box numbers instead of the recipient's address, such as "Shanghai Post Office Box (275) Zhuang Wenhua"; used to write telephone numbers instead of the recipient's address, such as "Shanghai Telephone Rental (22108) Zhang Boshun"; used to write Arabic numerals in the text of the telegram, such as "Rush Telegraphic Transfer (2500) Yuan for Emergency"; used to write code numbers and Arabic numerals indicating the date and number of the telegram in clear language banking and money industry telegrams, such as "(3518) (1601) Send 50,000 Yuan to Hengfeng Zhuang"; used to write business identifiers composed of Arabic numerals in the text of the telegram, such as "(814) Brand Haichang Cloth Goods Urgently Needed"; used to write a few foreign words mixed in the text of the telegram, such as "Money has been remitted (321000 Voltsdynamotor) Ready for use urgently ship to Beijing"; used to write a few foreign words mixed in the address, such as "Sassoon Building, Renji Road, Shanghai (RCA Communications Mr. Shecken)"; used to write several consecutive groups of code words in the text of the telegram, such as "Information received absconded partner Li Liang (also known as Guisheng) detain him immediately upon arrival in Ping"; used to write foreign language business identifiers, such as (ghf 45) (15BS) (D3), etc. The above writing formats are commonly used by general senders in major cities, which shows that parentheses are quite important in Chinese telegrams.</p>
<p>Should the above parentheses in Chinese telegrams be free of charge or charged? The current domestic telegram business rules have separate provisions. Those that are free of charge can be divided into three types: A. Parentheses used for house numbers, post office box numbers, and telephone numbers in the recipient's address in Chinese clear text or code telegrams. B. Parentheses used for Arabic numerals or trademarks composed of Arabic numerals in the text of Chinese clear language or coded telegrams. C. Parentheses used before and after code numbers and Arabic numerals indicating the date and number of the telegram in Chinese clear language banking or money industry telegrams. Those that are charged can also be divided into three types: A. Parentheses before and after a few foreign words mixed in the recipient's address or the text of Chinese clear language or coded telegrams. B. Parentheses before and after several consecutive groups of code words. C. Parentheses before and after foreign language business identifiers. The above parentheses should be charged one word fee according to the original telegram category and the price of the text type. For example, if examples 7 to 10 of the above writing format examples are assumed to be ordinary Chinese clear language telegrams, all parentheses will be charged at the ordinary Chinese clear language price, that is, each parenthesis () will be charged one dime. However, if these parentheses are used in Chinese coded telegrams, they should be charged two dimes according to the Chinese coded price.</p>
<p>Recently, disputes often arise between various telegraph offices and senders regarding whether parentheses used in Chinese telegrams should be free of charge or charged. If misunderstandings are caused by just one or two word fees, it will be detrimental to the future of the telegraph office's business. Therefore, detailed examples are given to explain the writing format of parentheses and whether they should be free of charge or charged, so that all sectors can have a detailed understanding of the telegraph office's regulations, which is also the mission that this publication should fulfill to the public.</p>
<h3>Social Telegrams Have Unexpected Effects</h3>
<p>Editor's note: The following letter and telegram are from Mr. Wang Zhicheng, a reader of this publication, to our company. Mr. Wang stated that he obtained a position in a certain department due to a social telegram. Therefore, he specially requested to disclose it in this publication for the reference of the general public.</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I have read in your publication about the convenience of social telegrams. I originally worked in an agency in Xi'an, but I was trapped in poverty and did not seek fame. Last month, someone took over as the minister of a certain department, an old friend from ten years ago. Separated by mountains, we had little contact. Picking up paper and writing a letter, I didn't know where to start. So I prepared a social telegram and sent it to the telegraph office to be sent, initially thinking that it was a convenient way to send congratulations. Unexpectedly, Mr. XX was overjoyed to receive this telegram and immediately sent a telegram inviting me to help him. I am now working in a certain position in a certain department. Only later did I realize the unexpected effects of social telegrams. I am attaching the telegram and request that you disclose it in the newspaper to express my gratitude and show the path to promotion. Respectfully,</p>
<p>I wish you good health!</p>
<p>Wang Zhicheng bows</p>
<p>To Minister XX of the XX Department in Nanjing: Reading the newspaper, I learned that you have gloriously taken over the XX Department, managing the XX affairs. I am very pleased to be associated with you! Like Nengge, I have long awaited Mengchang's patronage, and I share the joy of your promotion, like Gong Yu. I hereby send my congratulations and wish you great success. Your brother, Wang Zhicheng, bows</p>
<h3>The Past and Present of New Year's Socializing</h3>
<p>— Xia Zhi</p>
<p>People in the new century are most particular about the forms and means of "socializing," which change with progress. In the environment of the new century, "socializing" has almost become a major part of human life. From individuals to individuals, groups to groups, families to families, and even countries to countries, socializing is indispensable. On the surface, so-called social exchanges are nothing more than a common friendship; but in reality, "socializing is not just a matter of a little friendship, it can simply affect people's entire lives."</p>
<p>The most common form of socializing is probably New Year's greetings? Every New Year, people nearby visit each other, clasp their hands in greeting, and say "Congratulations!" People further away write letters of congratulations, keeping the postman busy, conveying boundless affection from house to house. Later, this changed to New Year's cards, using a red piece of paper printed with a name card, which soon turned into ready-made New Year's cards, with one's own name added; and the way of not buying ready-made New Year's cards gradually improved, and the procedures became more and more convenient. However, the times are constantly progressing, and now, mailing New Year's cards is an outdated way of New Year's greetings. Just look at the few days around New Year's Day, everyone receives a large pile of New Year's cards from all over, who would bother to check carefully which one was sent by whom? Even if you read it, it won't leave much of an impression, as if it's just a perfunctory article, not worth paying attention to. As for whether friendship can be enhanced as a result, it is naturally conceivable!</p>
<p>So, what is replacing this kind of New Year's card and circulating in fashionable social circles? Needless to say, it is New Year's social telegrams. Hearing the words "telegram," one immediately associates it with "fast." That's right, the end of this twentieth century is an era that values "speed." Disliking the slow pace of trains, airplanes were invented. Everything in society is developing consistently towards "fast," so "fast" is the most stimulating thing for people. When it comes to New Year's greetings, using telegrams is the most suitable for this requirement. New Year's greetings are originally an "old tune," and it is not easy to attract everyone's attention, but adding "fast" makes it completely different. If you receive a few New Year's social telegrams in colored envelopes during the New Year, you will definitely be curious and have to open them and read them, then the name of the person who sent you the telegram will be deeply imprinted in your mind. This is not just the effect of "novelty," because the word "telegram" itself has a kind of stimulation. This stimulation also helps to motivate you.</p>
<p>How a modern person's social skills are can directly or indirectly affect his entire life, so a smart modern person is unwilling to give up effective social tools. Social telegrams are the best kind of this tool. When your friends and relatives have the following events, (A) Celebrating New Year's, marriage, birth of a child, birthday, anniversary, graduation, going abroad, opening, moving, passing an exam, promotion, employment, invention, success, victory, ceremony, award, (B) Condolences for a death, burial, (C) Consolation for illness, famine, carelessness, injury, theft, failure, etc., send a social telegram for a few dimes, and its effect is more than ten times that of an ordinary letter. As the saying goes: "Don't burn incense at ordinary times, hug Buddha's feet in an emergency." The best way to burn incense is to use social telegrams.</p>
<h3>Telephone Ballad</h3>
<p>— Ye Linsheng</p>
<p>Suddenly hearing the bell ringing on the table, it is said to be the sound of the telephone in my house. Taking down the receiver to answer, I can actually communicate face-to-face from a distance. The telephone is, since its invention in America, Bell's reputation has spread to this day, and it is welcomed everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Installing a machine is really convenient: now you can call domestic provinces, counties, and villages, and in the future, you can call foreign countries, London, Paris, Berlin, New York, and Tokyo. Let's talk about the benefits from beginning to end, it can be said that everything is comfortable and everything is real. Some are for sending messages for happy events, weddings, and funerals, some are for relying on it to communicate private feelings, some are for extensive socializing and suffering from running around, so you might as well use it to talk to each other, some are for businesses managing huge fortunes, dialing a machine determines the market. There are also those who want to go to entertainment venues for recreation and can ask it to pass on a message to reserve a room. There are also those who return late at night and the door is closed and can ask it to call the people in their dreams. There are also those who are suddenly visited by unexpected guests, it is not difficult to ask it to send them to the prison gate. Such a multitude of functions is difficult to describe completely, so it is popular everywhere in cities and villages.</p>
<p>Moreover, the deposit fee is not much, and the machine is new. The new regulations also temporarily suspend the installation fee. The connection personnel are quick and friendly, saying "please" repeatedly. There is also the long-distance telephone connection between cities and villages, which can be accessed in all directions, not just Shanghai and Nanjing. It saves money and the sound is clear. It is not a false reputation that has been passed down for a long time. Everyone praises the telephone for being responsive. I advise you to try installing a telephone and see for yourself, and you will believe that my words are all true.</p>

<h3>Charcoal Cars Being Tested on the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway</h3>
<p>— Jianping</p>
<p>The newspaper reported on the 13th that charcoal cars from the Zhongming Factory are being tested on the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway. They carry many passengers from Shanghai to Changzhou, and the cars travel quite fast. The engine power remains between 32 and 38 horsepower from start to finish, reaching a maximum of 42 horsepower. The consumption of charcoal is more than 40 catties, costing about one yuan, which is only one-third of the cost of gasoline. The road is determined to convert all 60 cars to burn charcoal. The newspaper has repeatedly reported on the successful trial of Zhongming-style charcoal cars on highways in various provinces in the past one or two years. This test on the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway can be said to be another powerful confirmation. Its significance is not only the personal success of the inventor, Tang Zhongming, but also a glimmer of hope in the economic recession.</p>
<p>French Prime Minister Clemenceau said during the European War, "A drop of kerosene is as precious as a drop of blood." In recent years, international disputes have also focused on the kerosene issue. The exploitation of kerosene on the North Sakhalin Island by Japan and Russia, and the issue of the concession of oil mines in Abyssinia, are certainly the best examples. This time, the League of Nations' sanctions against Chongqing also focused on the oil embargo. This shows that the kerosene issue is not only an economic issue, but has long become an element of national defense.</p>
<p>Gasoline is an allotrope of kerosene. It is evaporated from kerosene above 150 degrees Celsius, so it is also called volatile oil. It is an important power source for today's transportation tools such as cars and airplanes. Many countries, because they do not produce gasoline domestically, have tried their best to study gasoline substitutes, such as alcohol, which was once considered a gasoline substitute, but it is not economically viable. Therefore, most of the research in various countries today is focused on charcoal, and they have all had considerable success. For example, Suzuki Katsutoshi and his brother Yoshiaki in Japan recently sent their successfully researched charcoal car to the Ministry of the Army and obtained a special patent certificate. Italian Mussolini, in order to resist the economic blockade of the League of Nations, specially gathered famous domestic technicians and adopted our country's method of using charcoal to replace oil, and has achieved further success. He once used a charcoal-powered car to make an international visit, passing through the capitals of eight countries, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, before returning to Rome. In addition, countries such as France, Germany, Switzerland, Finland, Sweden, the Czech Republic, and Hungary have also tried a kind of wood chip-powered car (Gasogene), and the number is increasing day by day. This so-called wood chip-powered car is also a charcoal car.</p>
<p>Our country's annual gasoline consumption is about more than 40 million yuan. From the perspective of the national economy, it is indeed a major leak. From the perspective of national defense, it is an even more serious problem. From the perspective of highways, it is also a great obstacle to development. The problem of gasoline substitutes is more serious than in other countries. However, because the country has been in turmoil for many years, the government has not taken care of it, and general entrepreneurs have not paid close attention to it. For example, Tang Zhongming invented the charcoal car three or four years ago, earlier than Japan and Italy, and Mussolini also sent people to study it, which has attracted attention internationally, but it has only been noticed in the country for a year. This cannot but make people feel regret. Now, the international crisis is becoming increasingly urgent, and the source of gasoline is worrying. The national economy is collapsing, and huge leaks cannot be left unaddressed. As for the only condition for developing the highway business, it is only to reduce the consumption of cars. People used to doubt charcoal to replace oil, but now all countries have adopted it, and Mr. Tang Zhongming in our country has also successfully researched it. After many tests, especially this test on the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway, it has been proven that it is not inferior to gasoline cars in terms of speed, and the economic savings have been greatly reduced. If the whole country can adopt it uniformly and improve it further, then all kinds of problems in national defense, national economy, and highway development can be solved easily. We hope that the government and domestic entrepreneurs will use all their strength to promote it!</p>
<h3>Papa's Back</h3>
<p>— Meng Hua</p>
<p>Winter days are especially short. After dinner, returning home from the bureau, the sky was already pitch black.</p>
<p>The banners of the year-end sales on the street fluttered in the evening wind. The temporary musicians hired by the silk shops were playing sentimental local songs, deafening the ears of passersby. I walked silently, feeling that every pedestrian's face was tense, and even their pace seemed particularly hurried. "In three days, it will be New Year's Eve," I thought silently, feeling suffocated by the pressure of the "year-end".</p>
<p>Turning into the alley, my younger brother, who was guarding the door, immediately ran over, pulling at my clothes, as if wanting to pull me down to listen to his whisper. He said in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Papa's back!" The expression on my brother's face was surprised and tense.</p>
<p>"Papa's back?" I muttered to myself in disbelief, "Is Papa really back?"</p>
<p>"He came back at three in the afternoon, and he's drinking at home now!" said my brother.</p>
<p>Immediately, my father's vague image reappeared before my eyes. About seven years ago, Father had followed a distant relative to Hubei, where he was said to be working in a yamen that specialized in tobacco taxes. Every year in December, Mother would always ask me to write, inviting Father to come home for a rest, but Father always put it off, using the excuse that the journey was too far and the travel expenses would cost a lot of money. In the last year or two, Father's letters had become increasingly rare, and the money he sent had also become less and less. Mother had fainted from crying several times over this matter, and even I had dropped out of school to work as a clerk in a small government office. Now, Father had floated home as if blown by the wind.</p>
<p>"This matter seems to be more ominous than auspicious. Why didn't Father send a letter to inform us beforehand?" I thought to myself as I stepped into the house. The kerosene lamp in the hall shone with a dull orange-yellow light. An old man was sitting beside the table. Seeing me come in, he put down the small wine cup he was holding and sized me up with a dazed expression.</p>
<p>"Papa!" I called out softly, suddenly feeling unspeakable sadness in my heart, and tears fell in a stream.</p>
<p>Vaguely, I saw Father nod to me, then pick up the small wine cup and take a sip of wine.</p>
<p>In my heart, there were originally countless words that I wanted to say, but this cold scene was like a big stone, suppressing them with all its might. I glanced at Father out of the corner of my eye. His temples were already gray, and two handfuls of withered grass-like whiskers grew along his mouth. The cloth robe appeared exceptionally greasy under the lamplight. The cloth shoes on his feet were covered with yellow soil, and half of the black shoe surface had turned yellow.</p>
<p>"Is the bureau busy?" Father finally broke the silence, asking in a hoarse voice.</p>
<p>"Very busy, these few days," I said.</p>
<p>"You must work harder in the future. I'm idle now," Father's voice was so low that I couldn't hear it clearly.</p>
<p>"Yes... yes..." I didn't know how to answer. Two soybean-sized tears dripped from my cheeks.</p>
<p>"You're not young anymore. See more of the world, suffer more hardships, and you'll gain more experience. Don't be like me, alas:" Father sighed deeply. A pair of rough hands held his head, and his head, covered with gray hair, kept shaking.</p>
<p>I stood there blankly, staring at the ground, wanting to find some comforting words for this father who had been running around for half his life, and whose outcome was finally so down-and-out, but...</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>my heart was numb.</p>
<p>Just then, Mother's harsh voice came from behind the hall: "Hey! You say that again, say that again, and I'll tear your little mouth! Your dad's idle, where will he find some spare money to buy me this trinket? I advise you to listen to your mother, or be careful of the whip!"</p>
<p>"You're not young anymore," Mother's voice turned softer. "When the new year starts, I'll have your dad send you to a shop to be an apprentice. People your age are already earning their own living outside. Hmph!"</p>
<p>The hall was as silent as a winter night in the countryside. Father sat there blankly, his left hand holding the wine cup motionless, staring intently out of the hall, where the sky was pitch black.</p>
<p>I stood there blankly, my vision gradually blurring.</p>
<h3>The Stubborn Child</h3>
<p>— Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>One winter, my father sent me to Yangjiao Town to settle accounts at the shop. Two days before I was to leave the town, it suddenly snowed heavily, and it seemed unlikely that the weather would clear up for several days. The river was also iced over, and the ticket office for the small gasoline boat hung a sign that read: "River Frozen, Service Temporarily Suspended." The old man Xiao, who drove livestock, stayed at the Changfa Hotel all day, chewing broad beans and drinking wine. When someone called him a beast driver, he replied with a stammer: "It's the end of the year, this donkey deserves a few days of rest too. Sir, wait for the road to open next year." He laughed and continued to drink his yellow soup.</p>
<p>Our shop always hired his livestock to transport goods because the land route was one-third shorter than the water route. When our shop assistant went to call him this time, he staggered to the shop and patted me on the shoulder warmly, saying: "Little boss, set off after the spring thaw. In this snowy weather, not to mention the livestock have no strength, old Xiao is getting old too and can't keep up! Little boss, it's dangerous to walk around with money!"</p>
<p>So I decided to spend the New Year in Yangjiao Town.</p>
<p>Yangjiao Town is on the fork road of Taixian County, with several hundred households. The main street also has silk shops and herbal medicine shops. Most of the residents are farmers. I go to the town once a year, but this was the first time I spent the New Year in the town. Every day after lunch, I stayed in the shop with nothing to do. In the days leading up to the New Year, it was usually the most idle time in the shop. The shop assistants, mindful of my presence as the little boss, were embarrassed to play mahjong or take a stroll in the alley. So I always wandered out of the shop alone, strolling from the west to the east of the town. Sometimes I would also have a drink with old man Xiao at the Changfa Hotel, returning to the shop for dinner at dusk. For the first three days of the New Year, all the shops were closed, and the shop assistants from various stores gathered to gamble with each other. Although the shop assistants in our store also intended to invite me to join, I couldn't do so because of the shop rules set by my father. On the one hand, I was afraid of spoiling their fun and preventing them from having a good time during the first three days of the New Year. I still strolled out after dinner. The street was quiet and I didn't see a single pedestrian, so I wanted to run a little further and see what the surroundings of Yangjiao Town looked like. That day, I walked to the ferry pier for the small steamship. Because the beach was frozen, many people were using wooden sticks and iron hammers to break the ice and draw water. I didn't know if old man Xiao had drunk his fill of yellow soup, but he was also rolling up his sleeves and mixing with the crowd, humming a tuneless melody while happily breaking the ice. None of them noticed me.</p>
<p>In the crowd, there was a thirteen or fourteen-year-old boy sitting alone on the stone steps, weeping. He was wearing very thin clothes, shivering, and seemed unable to sit still. Old man Xiao suddenly shouted: "Jin Gouzi is here! In this cold weather, your tears will freeze!" He turned around and saw me standing on the shore, and immediately jumped up like a child: "Little boss, do a good deed. This child has no clothes to wear and nothing to eat. Give him a bowl to eat at the shop."</p>
<p>In this way, the people breaking the ice all gathered around. They told me: Jin Gouzi was an apprentice in the blacksmith shop here. The boss, like old man Xiao, was a drunken fool. If he didn't have two hundred copper coins worth of sorghum wine every day, he would offend customers who came to his door, bursting out with insults as if someone was harming him by not letting him drink. The boss's wife was a shrew famous throughout Yangjiao Town, but she knew how to do business. If her husband offended a customer, she could put on a smiling face and apologize, even rummaging around to offer discounts to the customers. Thus, the reputation of the shrew was not as outstanding as her licentiousness. The apprentice, Jin Gouzi, had a stubborn temper. He couldn't stand the boss's wife's business tactics and spread bad words everywhere. When the boss had no wine to drink, he often used unpleasant words to mock him. As a result, the boss's wife didn't give him clothes to wear or allow him to eat. All the work in the shop, big or small, was pushed onto Jin Gouzi...</p>
<p>I was surprised by this child's stubborn temper and took him to the shop. But when the shop assistants asked him to eat, he shook his head and prepared to leave. Old man Xiao grabbed him like a chick, scolding him like a beast: "See where you're going to eat! You have to consider the host's feelings when you're throwing a tantrum. They're kindly asking you to eat!"</p>
<p>"I don't want to eat!" Jin Gouzi replied bluntly: "The boss's wife won't let me eat!"</p>
<p>"The little boss is asking you to eat. The boss's wife won't know. Old Xiao guarantees it!" Old man Xiao patted his chest with his fist.</p>
<p>Jin Gouzi glanced at me shyly and said: "I don't want to eat. I'm not eating the food from this shop anyway."</p>
<p>Old man Xiao scolded him, the shop assistants persuaded him, but Jin Gouzi refused to eat. So I paid close attention to this child. Every time I went to Yangjiao Town, I always asked old man Xiao about Jin Gouzi's recent situation. This year, I went to the shop to settle accounts again, and the shop assistants told me that Jin Gouzi had died. One day, the boss's wife beat him, and that night he was locked outside the shop door. He froze to death sitting on the stone steps, still sitting upright when he died.</p>
<p>The news that old man Xiao told me was: The neighbors had pulled him to their shop to sleep several times, but Jin Gouzi refused. So old man Xiao concluded: "I was certain that this child wouldn't have a good death. He was born with this cheap bone!"</p>
<h3>Goddess</h3>
<p>After a fierce battle, all of Gonggong's partisans fell dead at the foot of the mountain. Gonggong also died under Zhuanxu's blade. At that time, Zhuanxu held Gonggong's head in one hand and a bloody bronze knife in the other, standing above Gonggong's corpse, making a victory demonstration. He thought that now that he had killed Gonggong and eliminated a powerful enemy, he could dominate the world and claim the throne in the south in an instant. (Twenty)</p>
