<p>南京　（續昨）古人所說「不令而行」「不言而敎、」就是這個道理、我們一定要懂得不言而敎的效率如此之大、努力實施「以身作則」的敎化、然後才可以推行新生活運動、今天到會的各位同志、至少人每個都負了幾十幾百乃至幾千人敎導的責任、而首都這個地方、又是中外觀瞻所繫、要作全國模範的地方、如果各位都能以身作則、將自己的家庭、以及自己所主管的機關學校或團體澈底改造、使我們的子弟部屬和學生都能實行新生活、我想一定可以做出一個模範使新生活運動、實實在在能推行到全國、第四、我們推行新生活運動、一定要具「互助合作」的誠意、古人說「天下興亡匹夫有責」又說、「欲立立人、欲達達人」、推行新生活運動、旣屬關係國家興亡的事情、就是人人所應盡的責任、旣屬立己立人的工作、就是人人所應努力的要務、允共是我們革命黨員、要改造社會、建設國家、就先要改造人心、革新社會的風氣習慣、所負推行新生活運動的責任、格外重大、無論何時何地、只要想到或看到、有一事一物不合新生活的要求、不合現代的生活習慣、立刻就要負起責任、盡力改革、不好有一點推諉、一刻遲誤、如果我們一般智識分子、個個人引領以矯正人心、改造社會爲己任、我相信我們社會國家、不必說已經經過廿五年之久、就只說自倡導新生活運動這兩年以來、其進步亦不致如此之慢、過去的情形、就是各個人决沒有盡到、甚至根本不知道自己的責任、最好的也不過自己能實行新生活而已、別人如可、社會如何、再不去管、做敎員的只知道上課敎書、各機關的職員、只知道每天上辦公廳、在到學校進機關的路上、無論看見什麼事情、他都漠不關心、這兩天首都下了雨雪、一般車夫的雨衣和行動、這就是生活、就不成一個生活的樣子、外國人到我們首都來看、不必看其他的東西、只要看見一般車夫的生活樣子、就可以看透我們人民愚昧、社會的落後、和政府的缺乏能力、就可以間接推斷到我們國家、决不能久存於現在世界、現在我們要一般車夫都能自動的做到整齊淸潔、當然不容易、而且以他們境遇的窮苦、和智識缺乏、許多事情、實在難怪、但是我們一般有責任的人、允共是市政府和警察廳、一般負主管責任的人、到那裏去了呢、這些情形、爲什麼漠不關心、曾不想法子來改正他們、救濟他們、使他們稍微像一個樣子呢、只要我們主管機關稍微負一些責任、用一點心思、這件事一定可以做得了的、無奈大家都視爲與己無關、甚至連主管機關也彼此推諉、不知責任所在、所以始終無人來設法改良、如此還能推行新生活麼、大家要曉得新生活運動、固然要首先由我們自己實行起、但是决不是自己做到了就算事、如果認爲只要我們自己能實行新生活、或是只以爲個人的食衣住行都合乎禮義廉恥就够了、這是只可對於普通一般國民可以如此的說、但是我智識份子、就萬不可以此爲滿足、中國人普通最大毛病、就是所謂「各人自掃門前雪」、只知道有自己、不知道有別人、因此雖然是一個好人、因爲他不管人家的好歹、只知「獨善其身」、而不能負起「兼善天下」的責任、對於社會國家、毫無補益、這種人就不能算是一個現代的人、常然不配做推行新生活運動、要推行新生活運動、使全國國民的生活都能革新、使整個新的國家、能够建立起來、必須我們個個人能負起「兼善天下的責任、發揮「互助合作」的精神、每一個人、每一個機關團體、應從其縱的和橫的關係、與一切的個人機關或團體、密切連絡起來、彼此互助合作、來努力推行整個的社會新生活運動、換句話說、我們一個人僅僅自己能實行新生活、還不够、一定要以身作則、來勸導感化我們的子弟、部屬、學生、以及與我們接近的民衆、使他們都能够實行新生活、就是對於我們的長上、如果他有不對的地方、不好的習慣、我們能够誠心誠意向他貢獻意見、他也一定可以接受的、總之、必須個個人、個個機關團體、大家能發揮「互助合作的精神、才可以使新生活運動、眞實推行、以上所講的四點、是我們今後推行新生活運動的要件、也可以說、就是推行新生活運動的方法、此外今天想將新生活運動重要的意義、再和各位作一個補充的說明、在兩年以前的今天、我已經舉德國爲例、就國家與民族的復興、不在武力之强大、而在國民智識道德之高超的道理講明、新生活運動是當前救國建國與復興民族最有效的革命運動、簡單的講、新生活運動就是復興民族的運動、雖然這兩年以來、我們從事這個運動、沒有收到很大的實效、但是只能歸咎於我們一般領導的人、未能盡力、天下無論什麼艱鉅事業、只要有人做沒有做不好的、無論什麼危險的國家、只要有人來救、亦沒有挽救不轉的、那怕是亡了幾十年幾百年、只要有人、沒有不可以重行建立復興起來的、古人說、「事在人爲」、又說「人定勝天、」新生活運動是復興民族最有效的運動、只要我們能共同一致、實實在在來努力做、就不怕不能做成功、不怕不能挽救我們的國家、復興我們的民族、如果我們只會口說、而不去實做、或是只有形式而無實際、那是永遠不會成功的、現在我們推行新生活運動、宣傳常然很重要、但總不可虛張聲勢、有名無實、我們中國人做事、每每起初做得聲勢浩大、有聲有色、到後來精神懈怠、一無所成、這種「虎頭蛇尾」的毛病、就是一切事業失敗的原因、我們一般同志、務必預防這種毛病、眞心實力繼續不斷的來努力推行新生活運動、如此我相信一切艱難危險、都可由此打破、要建設一個現代的新國家、實在是很容易的事、惟最後大家特別要認識新生活運動、就是博愛樂羣的運動、剛才我講推行新生活運動、必須發揚互助合作的精神、已經提到我們中國最大的毛病、就是只知有已、不知有人、只知自私自利、不能互助合作、也就是不知道合羣樂羣、不知道愛自己的同胞、從修養方面講、就是缺乏「羣育」的訓練、從心性方面講、就是缺乏了「同情心」、失掉了「博愛」與「互助」的精神、一般人只要自己能够穿暖吃飽、就算了事、再不想到社會上一般同胞如何、更不想到國家民族百年千年以後如何、一般入普通的思想旣如此、再看一般人普通的行爲怎樣呢、中國人每每看見入家落下了水、他只在岸上望着、看見人家起了火、他只站在遠處看好看、遇着路上有人病倒在地下、他可以看了一看掉頭而去、决不想方法來援救、還有很多人、看到人家有不幸的事情、他不但不同情不援助、還要幸災樂、禍、看見人家做好的事情、他不但不鼓勵不協助、而且還要從旁阻難、譏笑忌妒、諾如此類卑劣自私冷酷無情的思想行爲、幾乎隨處可見、今後我們如果不能切實改革這個惡劣根性、恢復中國人固有尙仁愛、講信義的羣德、發揮「汛愛衆、而親仁」的固有精神、使全國同胞、隨時隨地、都能彼此明禮義知廉恥、親愛互助、我想無論我們國家如何廣大、歷史如何悠久、也難逃於滅亡之例、大家要曉得從來世界上就沒有一個孤獨而可以生活的人、所以從社會生活的整個連帶關係來講、事實上就根本沒有所謂「個人」、只有「社會國家的一分子、」我們做人旣不能逃於天地之問自外生存、只要是一個人、一定是社會的人、一定是過互助合作的社會生活、一定是規過勸善的團體生活、旣是社會的人、過社會的生活、就要有愛羣的德性、合羣的能力、與利羣樂羣的思想、必須如此、然後才可以呌做一個「人」、才可以生存於此科學發達、社會進步、人與人更加利害與共休戚相關的現代、所以必須是博愛樂羣的人、才是現代的人、才可以建立現代的國家、因此我們大家以後凡是發見社會絲毫的缺點、或看出政府各種弊端、就應該不分彼此、直率的報吿他主管機關、期其改正、因爲要使政治和社會有進步、能改良得快、必須要有社會的領導者、允其是智識階級、特別要負責貢獻、方能達到革故鼎新目的的、因爲改造國家與社會、决不是只靠政府的力量、所能成功的、必須依賴社會的羣策羣力、方能得到完滿的結果、所以現代的敎育、除「德育」「智育」「體育」之外、還要特別注重「羣育」、現在我所倡導的新生活運動、也是要特別注重羣性的培養、使一般國民能發揮博愛的精神、增進樂羣的美德、養成互助合作的習慣、增加同心協力的效能、所以「新生活」就是愛羣的、合羣的生活、就是全國同胞彼此親愛互助合作的生活、這互助合作的樂羣牛活、纔是我們所說眞正的新生活、如果我們一般同胞、能够改革過去一切自私自利的生活、大家能實行這種博愛樂羣的新生活、我相信要建立一個現代的新國家、實在非常容易、所以新生活運動、果能普遍推行、確實做到、就可以挽救國家、復興民族、關於新生活運動的意義、和推行的方法、兄弟過去已經講得很明白、今天趁此二週年紀念的集會、特別再將以上幾點意思、允其是羣性訓練的重要、吿訴各位、要請各位照此切實努力、然後新生活運勁、才能得到實效、各位的辛苦、才不致枉費、到新生活運動最後成功的時候、我們新的國家、就可以建設起來、今天這個日子、就可以成爲民族復興一個重大的紀念日、希望大家其同一致努力、完成新生活運動的使命、（廿日中央社電）</p>

<p>— 道</p>
<p>美國山額夫人聞將於二十三日抵滬提倡節育運動夫入十數年前曾來我國今决舊地重遊國人對於夫人之主張當有進一步之認識據報載夫人過香港時曾爲常地牧師公然抨擊指爲性生活墮落之結果此種宗敎上道德上之是是非非姑不具論要之近年來在歐美各國節育已成公開之運動而此項運動是吾適應中國之需要似亦頗値研究者茲請就我國人口問題考察之</p>
<p>第一我國今日入超問題之最嚴重者莫過於糧食僅此一項每年卽須輸出現金一萬萬餘元我國之糧食生產已不足供本國人口之所需殊爲明顯此種現象或爲我國農業退步之結果但人口之膨脹當亦爲重要原因之一第二中國耕地之擴張未必有多大之希望蓋中國土地面積雖號稱四百餘萬方里但山脈沙漠居其三分二且五百公尺以下最適於耕作之地不過六十萬方里佔全面積不過百分之一四而未耕之地卽使開發亦所增無幾査我國現有可供開發之耕地（卽包括邱陵高原在內）未必能超過已耕者之數而我國農民現有之耕地每人平均不過三畝有半他日卽使荒地完全開發亦不過每人得五六畝唯據人口學者庫辛斯基言每一農人最少應有十華畝始足以維持生活故縱使荒地盡闢恐民食問題與農民問題亦不能解决</p>
<p>第三國家之强弱不在其人口之衆多而在其國民之質的優秀欲求國民之質的優秀一在實施優生政策二在普及敎育提高國民之文化水準然後可望國民健全有爲能與異族競存於今世顧就第一點言之我國因一般人民生育過濫之結果不惟死亡率增加抑且國民體質日趨孱弱再就第二點言之則我國人口以農民爲最多國民敎育之關鍵實在於農民然我國農民每人所有之田平均旣不過三畝半設每畝每年之收入爲十五元則每年之收入不過數十元以之仰事俯畜猶感不遑焉有餘力及於子女之敎育乎</p>
<p>綜上所述可知我國人口增加與糧食生產之不能相互調節實爲當今最嚴重之問題欲謀解决雖有待於多方面之努力而推行節育運動稍减民間生育過濫之痛苦對於上一問題之解决要亦不無幾許裨益也</p>

萬元，嗣因年有盈餘，雖遭一二八之炸毀，並停工　　，但自前資本仍能增至三十萬元。廠址設於　北八里橋，約佔地墓二畝左右，新　之　　費約五萬　。廠內機器頗為精良，有日本式，德國式，美國式，共値十餘萬元。經　　　東張　　，對於造紙　　，經騐極富，　品有　　更　邊　　，　象　為商標，極為　　，星　美，每日出紙　十件（每件二十三令），　成　紙號為該廠推銷　總經　　　六，源泰森記造紙廠——源泰原為地產大王程霖生氏獨資經營，成立期間約在民國十八年，廠址在徐家匯謹記路，資本三十萬元。二十二年程君將該廠出租與劉柏森君，改為源泰森記。　劉君約久記，元記，益記興等紙號，添加資本一萬五千元。該廠發行所前在泗涇路江西路口，目下暫遷泗涇橋十六號。該廠基地約有四十餘畝，廠屋機器等設備尚稱完美，出品亦以連史毛邊為主（以資童為商標），每日可出五百餘件，推銷本外埠。　　此外，本埠尚有造紙廠多家。如閘北長安路之上海造紙廠，係　　蔭三，張德明等合股而成，創設於民國二十二年，資本二十八萬元；吳淞蘊藻浜之大中華造紙廠，係劉敏齊，王　章，諸股東，合資創設於民國二十三年，資本定五十萬元（除連史毛邊外，更擬製造道林紙牛皮紙），此外更有製造紙版之新華廠，製造臘光紙之美錦廠，肯為本埠造紙廠之主要乾，僅　幅　係，不再逐一紀載。　　按本埠各造紙廠中，有雨點須加注意：一為造紙之主要原料木漿，皆自海外購來，二為銷用最大之報紙，本埠廠尚未從事，自行製造。　　四·本埠各書局及報館之用紙實况　洋紙之最大銷路，為書局報館印刷書籍報紙之用，但書局與報館所用紙張，並不相同，書局所用者為報紙·有光·道林·機製連史等紙，而報館所用者，僅捲簡報紙與坦平報紙而已。茲將各種紙張用途及各主要書局報館用紙情形，詳細分述於後，以供工商界之參考：　　（甲）書局應用之紙張　　　有光紙　從前各書局印刷小說敎科書等所用紙張，以有光紙為最多，故各洋行常有大宗定貨，近年來報紙售價低廉，如與有光紙比較，相差無幾，目有光紙僅能一面印刷，不若報紙使利，因是各書局均已改用報紙，即墨色石印書局印刷舊式書，亦皆改用報紙，故近來有光紙銷路已大如前矣。　　　報紙　報紙有自腦威瑞典輸入者，亦有自加拿大輸入者，從前各大書局所用之報紙，槪係腦瑞二國貨物，自二十二年國民政府加稅後，以捲簡報紙為刋印日報所用，有關文化至鉅，故徵稅獨輕，於是紙商乘機向加拿大定購輕磅捲簡報紙，切開改裝，行銷市上，售價亦低廉不少。腦瑞二國所產之報紙，以坦平者居多，每件約十五六令，每令五百張，其重量不等，自三十七磅至四十五磅為止，各書局所用者以重磅較多。近來各大書局，以加拿大捲簡報紙價格低廉，乃亦紛紛向各洋行定購，至於磅份之輕重，隨客所便，可於定貨時預定之。　　　道林紙　道林紙有光毛之分，為印刷西文書籍所必需，其他凡略為講究之書籍，多以道林紙印刷之，其重量不一，自四十五磅起至一百廿磅為止，印刷書籍最適用乾，則為七十，以商力與中華二家數量最多，道林紙之用途亦為最廣，自二十二年政府增加關稅，道林紙增稅更重，因之道林紙售價日昂，各書局不敢多購，謚是輸入大减，吾國天章紙廠，近年亦有道林紙出品，各書局以其物美價　，乃紛紛向天章紙廠購買，銷額為可觀。但增稅不及一年，至二十三年七月一日，國民政府修改關稅，又將道林紙稅特別减輕，各洋行减稅後，成本亦可低廉，乃將定價减低，紙商聞訊，紛紛向洋行定貨，造成大批西貨道林紙重銷市上之現象。　　　連史紙　連史紙本為吾國出品，凡用手工製造者，僅能為包紮物件之用，銷路不廣，如用以印刷古書者，則均用機製連史紙，近年商務中華二書局刋印舊書頗多，故其所用機製連史紙亦殊不少，當瀋變未發生以前，機製連殊低廉，因是用戶樂於購買，自瀋變後，國人曾一度抵制日貨，吾國江南，寶山，源泰等紙廠，遂乘機勃興，出品大為暢銷，但此種好現象，年來已不復再見矣。　　至於本埠各書局之用紙數量，自以商務·中華·世界·三家用紙較多，其他各書局次之。　　（乙）報館應用之紙張　　報館用紙數量甚巨，往昔各報館在未置捲簡機器以前，所用紙張，均係普通之報紙，現今除少數仍用普通報紙外，其餘各報館均已購置捲摔筒機器，故近來捲簡報紙，銷路日廣，每年可有一萬餘噸。吾國報館，所用報紙輕磅居多，僅有四十餘格蘭姆而已，且各報館所用捲簡報紙其寛度之尺寸亦並不一律，凡向洋行定購時，各照其機器之寛度定製現令市上所售之捲簡報紙，大槪係加拿大之輕磅貨色，每　可切十八令至十九令，惟各報館所用之捲簡紙，槪係重磅，每　僅有十食至十二令而已。各報館以前購買報紙向維昌洋行採購者居多，近年來泰和洋行販賣加拿大報紙，營業日見發達，此外如茂孚·古司馬·魯麟·孔士等洋行，與各報館亦有交易，但為數不多云。（未完）</p>

<p>申報文藝專刊清代的小說禁黜  另境　　有清一代，文禁最嚴，康雍乾堿朝層與大獄，株連無窮，到如今，那些存留着檔案裏，還能給我們想　起當時的宙厲風行的一斑。但這種大抵是關於政治的案子，以摩登話說是「反革命」，可異現在找不到一個當年被燬的書目，否則倒可以供現下一般那民族主義乾的參考的，因為這些被燬的原因大多是含有民族思想的綠故，現今豈非已變為「革命」了麼？另一方面在，關於小說的標黜，也十分嚴峻，不過並非因為「革命小說」，却因誨浮海盜。今天偶然在一本筆記裏邊發現一張被禁的書目，共列禁黜的小說一百三十三種之多，可算洋洋大觀了。這位禁黜的功臣是江蘇巡撫了日昌，事在同治七年，現在就運丁功臣的札文一起抄錄下來，供關心明清小說掌故者參考：　　「為札飭嚴禁事：照得淫詞小說，最易壞人心術，乃近來書買射利，往往鏤板流傳，掦波扇燄。水滸西廂等書，幾乎家置一　，人懷一　。原共著述之始，大　少年肖薄，以綺膩為風流；鄉曲武豪，藉放從為任俠。而愚民　職，逐以犯上作亂之事，視為尋常。地方官漠不經心，方以盜案奸情，紛歧疊出，殊不知忠孝廉節之事，千百人敎之而未見為功，奸盜詐偽之書，一二人道之而立萌其禍，風谷與人心，相為表裏。近來兵戈浩刦，未嘗非此等踰閑蕩檢之說默釀其殃，若不嚴行禁燬，流毒伊於胡底！本部院前在藩司任內，曾通飭所屬，宣講聖論廣訓，並頒發小學各書，飭令認眞勸解，俾聲碼鄉士民，得以目染耳濡，納身軌物。惟是尊重正學，尤須力黜邪言，合極將標書目，黏單札飭……一律嚴禁！……　　列入禁書的共有一百數十種，在這一百數十種的書目裏，其實並非完全誨淫誨盜的小說，而尤其誨盜的則僅三數種。到現在，這些小說固然大部份都已經不存在了，但這不存在的原因倒不是因他的一禁，却是小說的本身價値給歷史淘汰的結果。　　清代的禁黜小說，不僅是這一次，在這以前還有好幾次的嚴旨查禁，俞正變的癸已存稿上有一段說：　　「……其小說之禁，順治九年題准，瑣語淫詞充沛行嚴禁。康熙四十八年六月議准，淫词小说及各種秘藥，地方官嚴禁。五十三年四月九卿議定，坊肆小說淫記詞嚴查禁絕，版與書銷燬，違者治罪，印者流，賣乾徒。乾隆元年覆准，淫詞　說，疊架盈箱，列肆租賃，限文到三日銷燬；官故從者，照禁止邪不能察緝例，降二級調用。嘉慶七年，標坊肆不經小說，此後不准再行編造。十五年六月，御史伯依保奏禁燈草和尚，如意君傳，濃情快史，株林野史，肉蒲團等。……十八年十月，又禁止淫詞小說。　　這樣看起來，了功臣尚未札飭以前，早就有過三申五令了，而結果到丁功臣巡撫江蘇的時候，還可列舉出一百五十三種之多，世風之丕變，豈非可畏哉！在葛斯普笳森林里  黑丁　　——伊蘭哈達山的旅途上——　　已經過慣了山國旅途上流浪的艱苦，已經迷醉了山國荒漠的景緻；我愛住在索倫人之家，我愛看索倫女人的嬌笑。　　三天前，我是從拉泌瑙村來到萊喔比村的，由於路上跋涉的疲勞，終使我在古巴蒙尼老頭子家里足足歇了三天。　　要走的那一清早晨，當我還在沉睡時，古巴蒙尼的老婆子戈麗輕輕的拍着我的胳膊，瞪着兩隻衰老的不中用的眼珠子瞧着我，張開枯燥的嘴唇，從她那没有牙齒的嘴里，發出喔嚕嚕嚕的聲音：　　——哈汀克，起來吃飯吧。　　我醒了。　　——呵，太陽出來啦嗎？　　懶倦地，舒鬆着。兩隻臂膀。　　戈麗笑了笑，嘴里又是喔嚕嚕嚕的：　　——外邊是波溜，（大霧）那會出太陽。今天你是不能走的，還是在這住幾天吧，等天氣清朗了再走。　　——不，不，怎樣大的波溜我也得走，無論如何今天我是要趕到沙爾納村去。　　——走是可以走的，不過就怕路上麻煩，你知道葛斯普笳那一片森林是不好走的，常常閙馬客，（土匪）尤其是在這樣的壞天氣，路上來往的人又少，那是太危險不過的。　　戈麗的女兒妮珍麗，剛剛燒好了飯，她就跑過來，站在戈麗老婆子身後，向我瞪着兩隻美麗的眼珠子，嚴厲正色的可就裂開嘴皮：　　——還是不走吧，媽媽怕你在路上遇着馬客。　　古巴蒙尼老頭子，在院子一邊忙，一邊也大聲的説：　　妮珍麗，怎麽的也不讓哈汀克冒着波溜走，一來怕受病，二來怕遇着馬客……　　這麽着，我却有些躊躇不安了，我默默的瞧着戈麗老婆了那一張没有牙齒的嘴，瞧着妮珍麗那兩隻美麗的眼珠子，我削瘦的臉上爬動着一縷一縷的灼熱的光。我乾涸的心湖激動着夢一般的微笑的漪漣。然而，我只是靜靜的回應他們一個含笑無語的沉默。　　我開始歌頌，歌頌我這山　的流浪人是幸福的，旅途之家，也能給我一個温存的慰安呵。　　可是，我倒底走不走呢？這又給我一個悲哀的深思：假若眞照古巴蒙尼的老婆那樣説法，一旦走到了葛斯普笳那繁茂的森林里遇到馬客，這可怎麽辦呢？難道我能把這唯一的財産——一個小行李捲，就白白的被他們留下嗎？但，我想馬客總不至於這麽不開面的，他們是不會留下我這一個小行李捲的，他們是搶有錢的人，對於窮人他們是表同情的，更何况我這飢寒交迫的山國的孤獨的流浪人呢？我想，我想果然遇到他們，我把我這流浪的艱苦哭訴給他們聽，再説上幾句好聽的話，總可以觸動他們的愛憐而高抬貴手讓我過去吧？　　於是，我下决心是要離開萊喔比村，離開古巴蒙巴，戈麗，和妮珍麗。　　吃過早飯，在古巴蒙尼，戈麗，和妮珍麗的殷勤的熱誠的挽留中，我終於背起行李捲來，却踏上濃霧瀰漫的崎嶇的拉拉亞堪山道。　　喘了一聲像霧一般的嘆息，我便站下來，對相隔得不遠的面佇立在門外的古巴蒙尼，戈麗，和妮珍麗的模糊的影子，揺動着手，嘶着沙亞的嗓子：　　——請回吧！回頭我來瞧你們。　　古巴蒙尼老頭子，拿着一枝旱烟袋，使勁的擺動着手：　　——千萬小心，要快走，不等天黑就可以趕到沙爾納村去。　　——嗯嗯，年輕的人没有家……　　戈麗老婆子這麽嘆息。　　——回頭千萬記得來看我們……　　妮珍麗惘然了。　　我走了。　　我沙沙地前進了。前頭，後頭，左邊，右邊，那是一團灰白色的重濁的潮濕的霧。呵，迷濛的霧，迷濛的山路，迷濛的我旅人底心呵！我是挣扎在無邊迷濛的黑暗的旅途上，疲憊地孤寂地跋涉着……　　我的旅途，又是多麽悠長而遼遠呵！穿過了平坦的原野，穿過了坎坷的山崖，穿過了無邊的黑暗，但，我終没有一個静静的立足的地址，正像秋風下那一片一片的幽魂似的落葉。孤獨地踏着人生的道，我是曾做着許多不同一的渺然的夢！　　在這空曠的荒漠的山國的旅途上，我這寂寞的心，是正在患着沉重的憂鬱病呵！　　我是永遠在患着沉重的憂鬱病呵：春天，夏天，秋天，冬天。我不能説出我這憂鬱病的成分來，我就覺得我底心是陰晦悲悽……。　　我没有在路上猶疑片刻，我像奔忙什麽似的往前進着。我望不見遠的山野，森林，叢莽，村落，人影。我只能聽到馬的吃草聲，羊的叫，狗的狂吠，輕微的山林的人語，以及小孩的啼哭。　　太陽沉没在濃霧裏。我也沉没在濃霧裏。　　當饑餓不能再讓我抱着沉重的脚步往前進時，我便摸索着山道，向狗的狂吠的處所，踽踽地走去。　　走進了一個荒僻的山村，在一個鄂倫人家裏乞求了兩盌冰凉的白皮，（包米稀飯）喂飽了肚子。但不能讓疲倦的腿步得到片刻的安息，我又開始前進了。　　—千萬小心，要快走，不等天黑就可以趕到沙爾納村去。　　心裏翻覆的思索着古巴蒙尼老頭子的話。　　走着，走着，葛斯普笳森林近在目前了。　　我本能的站下來，喘了幾口氣，抹了抹面額上的汗珠，便胡亂的思索了一些意外的遭遇，用悽愁的眼光向濃霧的深處探望了幾下：糢糊，黑暗，恐怖。呵，我的兩腿立刻失却前進的勇氣了！好一回，我像給另一種思索把我趕進了一個興奮的世界裏。我摸了摸措在脊後的一個小行李捲，我又瞅了幾眼穿在身上的一件破大衣，於是，我忘却了一切踏着鋼鐵一般的堅步沙沙地朝着斯普笳那一片繁茂的黑黝黝的森林前進了。　　在葛斯普笳森林裏，我渺小得像一隻飛去的小鳥。濃霧壓着我，森林也壓着我。我瞧不見森林以外的東西，只能瞧見踏在脚底下那鬆軟的灰黄色的沙泥。　　偶然聽見前邊有沙沙的脚步聲音，我意識裏便活躍起來一個兩個，三個，……獰惡可怕的面孔！於是，我的一顆殘破的心便悸跳起來，默然的：—呵，馬客！　　但是，脚步並不停留的却仍是往前走着。當迎面沙沙的脚步聲音迫近了我的跟前，而終至從我身旁遛過去，這，我脚禁要回過腦袋去瞧瞧他們的背影，心，心呵一度悸跳而這才變爲安然了。　　不知道在什麽時候，濃霧却變作濛濛的小雨了。我在濛濛的小雨的葛斯普笳森林裏趨着步，身子已開始凄冷發抖！　　當天色晦得猶如蒼茫的黄昏時分，我却平平安安的走出繁茂的葛斯普笳森林。　　從濛濛的小雨的陰密的遠處，微微的送來幾聲犬的狂吠，牲口的叫喚，小孩的吵嚷，我不禁又默然的：　　—呵，這恐怕就是沙爾納村吧？　　我底心有些舒鬆了。　　踏上泥濘的山道，我在濛濛的小雨裏走着，走着，……一夜  江寄萍　　也許是生活不能安適的緣故吧？近來常常是失眠，有時眼是疲倦得發酸了，躺下去仍然是睡不着：有時躺下去像是睡着了，可是外面一切的聲音都聽得很眞切的；像在朦朧的夢中一樣，一點很小的聲音都可以將我驚醒。例如在我似睡未睡之際，隣家忽然有人叫門，一陣敲門的聲音，便震得我心跳起來，此後便終夜也不能睡着；有時睡到半夜，即或是無人驚擾，也會無端的醒來，這樣也是照例的再睡不着的了。　　因爲失眠的緣故，却使我有工夫欣賞着夜的趣味。按理説夜裏應該是很寂靜的，可是不然，自己的屋中就先不清靜：我桌子上放的小檯鐘，在白天一點聲音也没有，在夜間他却響的分外清楚，「的達」的響聲像是在屋中也有了回響：爐中的煤，也會畢剥的爆炸起了，暖水壺裏熱氣衝得軟木塞子絲絲的發出細響，這聲音很小又像很遠，彷彿像極遠的地方有一架留聲機在送出女人的歌聲；老鼠在牆犄角裏爬着，在紙簍裏去尋食物，那種沙沙的聲音，彷彿經過了擴音機，非常的響，非常的刺耳。就是這屋中的聲音，已經够雜亂的了，何况還有外面的響聲呢！這裏同鄉村的地方一樣，還有打更的，有賣蘿　的小販，有賣報的小孩子，每天他們來到這裏都有一定的時間，而且先後的秩序也絶不會錯，打更的先來，是由近而遠的，「的的多」，「的的多」的打着梆子，鏜鏜！跟着就是兩下鑼，這已是二更了。等到鑼聲隱隱的聽不眞切了，就有賣蘿蔔的來了，頭頭的聲音是由遠而近的，慢慢的走到胡同口上來了，一會兒隣家的門響起來。跟賣蘿　的説話的，是那個面容憔悴的年青的女人，我在白天見過她，聽見她買過東西，聽見她哭過，我知道她有一個夜夜都不回家睡覺的丈夫，可是有時他却會在深夜因敲門，看看　有沒有外遇。她也許是專為等他回來敲門吧？所以很晚的不睡；她當賣　下，而且喜歡同賣蘿　的談話，說知的聲音，是隱約可聞的，只是談的是什麼，却不大聽得清楚，以後就聽見幾個銅板擲到磁罐子裏去，門便關上了，賣蘿　的顫顫的聲音，又漸漸的遠去了。這個可憐的女人，她也許感覺太寂寞了吧？每天在賣蘿下的小販一來，我便這樣想着。這種聲音才寂靜下去，賣報的小孩子就一定會來的。他不知道在那裏弄了幾張數日前的舊報，我也不知道這裏有誰買他的報，他總是這樣喊着：「看晚报……新来的……吴佩孚……」底下便再也没有形容词了，聽了　人十分的不舒服，彷彿聽人家說話，而只說了半句，可是以下的話他無論如何也不說了。賣報的小孩子一走，隣家的鐘使要打十二點了，我知道待不了一會兒，打更的又要過來打三更了，這樣的夜是寂靜的嗎？　　昨天因為朋友家的喜筵，喝不幾杯酒，回來便酬鮁入睡了，不想睡到半夜，就聽見像雷響似的敲門的聲音，我在夢中熬醒，原來是隣家的那個不回家的丈夫又回來的，以後就聽見女人的啼聲，拍桌子的聲音，木棍的將茶壺擊落到地上的　聲。我倒也不大怎樣在意，因為那女人的哭是常事，她的丈夫喝醉了酒，就常閙脾氣，打碎東西的。他們的嘈閙雖然不算什麼，可是我却因此睡不着了，躺在床上，看看瀘中胃出来的青色的火燄，心中有一種說不出的鬰悶；鬰鬰的冷月，山窗帘中送進一縷幽光，正照在我的害案上，將桌上的那盆水仙花映得非常的好看。隣家那憔悴的少婦嚶的啼聲，還約略的可以聽見一點。在月光移過地上去的時候，我已朦朧的睡着了。　　今天起床之後，就聽見家人談着隣家少婦，據說是她丈夫發現了好不規矩的呈，至於怎樣不規矩却不大暁得，今天早晨已經搬了家，有人看見好走的時候還在哭着，搬到什麽地方去也不知道了。在茫茫宇宙间，總少不了這樣可憐的人的。　　我聽了這消息，心裏立刻像壓了一塊大石，這可憐的女人上那裏去了呢？我感覺有點寂寞！同時我想到她的寂寞也許是永民無盡的吧？這可憐的人！　　（完）先喫藤條後吃粥隨喜偶記  思慕　　A城中有許多新興的佛敎結集，每一個結集里聚了許多新皈依的佛敎信徒。　　一個特別禮聘來的各尚底大名震動了這里的佛敎世界，講經說法的佛會一處開過又是一處。當和尚的法輪轉到效外我所住附的一個佛堂的時候，我也按不住好奇心，跑到那裏去隨喜隨喜，這也是「我佛」所謂「因綠」吧。　　已快到開講的進光，寛敞的葵棚裏坐有好幾十人，在外頭三三兩兩站着的也有不少。幾個老婆子在院內忙着泡　子，剝冬　，備辦素筵，男用人們忙着端茶加櫈。　　「七爺　您常來這裏聽經呀？」「一個在我前頭走的大腹賣似的中年男子，向着一個小鬍子拱手「您老對於佛法很有研究吧？」　　一不，不，我只陪太子讀書，今天還是內人强拉我来的，」小鬍子用手指指離們們幾步一個女人，「其實，她也不大懂。」　　「××法師是中國數一數二的佛學家，聽聽也不錯」他們一路說着一　進棚裏去了。　　在棚門口，一個穿西服掛着證章的青年正跟一個矮軍官殷勤地搭訕！　　「××法師講的摩登佛法，陳參謀從前聽過吧？倒還有點道理，」聽說今天就有許多人要向他皈依呢？陳參謀只點點頭，臉上露出沈思的樣子。　　棚是特別為這次說法而蓋的，還沒有十分蓋好，棚匠們正在加着幾條。壇上設着一張太師椅，前面供着一座塑金的佛像，有两瓶香花伴着，檀下鋪有三個浦團和香燇，還備有代記錄用的桌椅。聽衆是分男女在兩旁坐着，佛珠和經卷拿在許多人的手裏。在他們的中間，我發見了肥頭大耳的紳士，面無人色的青年男子，油頭粉面的少奶奶，木乃伊般的老太婆。和尚只有幾個，像秋後的果實那樣稀疏地在居士的林中點綴着。　　當我正在坐定，把聽衆打量的當兒，聽衆忽然都站起來，許多人連訪合掌，一個穿褐黃袍的和尚給住持引進來了。　　住持蓄着　髪，面容黃瘦帶病，倒像一個道士。他沒有精打彩地用本地話介紹了幾句後，已端坐在壇上的和尚便開始說法了。他的矮肥的身體把太師椅塞個滿滿，從窗戶射進來的下午的冬天太陽，恰晒在他的西瓜似的胖腦袋上，假使他的鼻上不是架着一副近視眼鏡，兩腿也盤起來的話，他眞活像他面前的那尊金佛了。　　開頭的話照例是一些客套，但是他操的是寗波官話，聲音像說給自己聽的那樣低沈，替他專話的青年和尚又念書般背出來，聽起來眞是費力。當他講到正文把「彌勒上生兜率內苑經」的「三等九品」的意義解釋的時候，聽衆中已有好些在閉目的養神，數佛珠，老太婆伸着頭呆望着，她们带来的小孩子又出又進的穿挿。　　「今天講凈土宗，太平凡了，沒有甚麼摩登哲理」坐在我後頭的西裝客失望似地自言自語着。　　「皈依彌勒佛跟別的法門不同，修得好，馬上就可以見到彌勒佛的……」　　和尚的話還沒有告一段落，突然女府裏起一陣大亂，許多人站起來。　　「拿萬金油來呀！」　　「不行，快拿毯子。煨兩片生　來吧！」　　女人們吱喳吱喳嚷着，原来座中一个老太婆已昏過去了，臉也變做偈黃紙似的。　　男聽衆雖屹坐不動。但是眼睛已向女座望過去。壇上的和尚繼續講完一段才停止，眼睛還是垂着。　　一做到心無一物眞不容易，你看，有道行的和尚到底是不同呀！」有人這樣的讚嘆。　　「這位居士恐怕入了定吧！」西裝客笑說着，旁邊的軍官司含怒似的望了他一眼。　　「攙她出去吧，不要這樣子攪亂秩序。」住持對女佛侶發出警告。　　經住持一說，病人雖仍然留在棚裏擁着毯子閉着眼睛靠在椅子上，但是秩序已好了許多　　當佛法講完的時候，座上已空了三分之一，一些人如夢方醒的睜開眼睜伸着懶腰。住持循例道謝，和宣佈結庵的經過以後，幾個和尚，陳參謀，大腹買，和一些女居士簇擁着××法师回到精舍裏去。　　带着斜晕的葵棚已空了，只棚匠还在竹架上綷綷　　地工作著，前面的菜地送來一陣的澆肥的異香。「客觀的眞實」  屈軼　　——讀高爾基文學論札記——　　亞理托曼說高爾基這册論文集是包括了我們文學上一切的基本問題。是把二個世界——社會主義的社會與資本主義的社會——浮雕地分明地對立起業。是將二個陣營——有產者，利已主義者，小布爾喬亞與社會主義建設的英雄——對立起來的。　　關於這，我閃不去管它。但我們讀了這册東西，處處可得到不少的新見解。即如在他論詩那篇論文里，他拿出了在文學上作為永久的主題的「自然」「死」與「戀愛」的不同見解。（中譯文，見雜文）叫我猛然覺得過去理解的錯誤。　　在這里，我要摘錄一點高爾　論「客觀的眞實」的文字。因為我贖了那段文字，我覺得高兩爾基這篇文藝放談，彷彿特別是為中國讀乾寫的。原文如下：　　「有些論者說：「藝術是奉住於「客觀的眞實」的。但是這「客觀的眞實」是什麼呢？關於這個，他們並沒有問到。而且對於新興階級之「主觀的」眞理，對於組織有新的創造力的數百萬人們的時代，它的關係又是如何呢？關於這個，他們可不想到了。　　我以為「客觀的眞實」，不過是一種照相，也許比照相還惡劣。所謂比照相還惡劣，這因為它是偽善的，是讀過哲學書的人們所說的「二元論的」。客觀的眞實，是把人類與世界，社會環境分離開來，而把握着的。这是同时混同了誠實與卑劣，愚純與狡猾，隨便地把握人類的。這是道斯托以斯夫基那些人，將人當做「神與惡魔」之相克，而把握着的。人類常常是為誰而犧牲。亦即是為社會的，甚至為同性愛所歪曲的那種「性的情感之世界」所牲犧。小市民這種愛情之中，情願二口兒過活，却不希望有孩子，這是非常明白地隱藏着不用劳心的偷　打算。小市民一般是受難者。就在物質生活尚在幸福時代，他也為那幸福能否永續而感到不安。他彷彿感到自己周圍，有剝削自己皮子的手，比巨大的槍口還粗的市民的手揮動着。小市民對於「客觀的眞實」的存在，對謚為他那。思想與感情溶鑄出來的矛盾所充滿的文學底表現，總感到極大的利益。這因為是使叫他安心，為他辯護的，叫自己合理化的。但這正是在我們年青作家之前，誰也沒有觸到過的主題。　兢赴喘息於受難之中的小市民與「客觀的眞實」乃有利於小市民的這個主題。……「客觀的眞實」，在其根底里，是和宗敎相共通的。這是僅給人一點安慰吧了，但這是比宗敎更有害處。因為是比宗敎更巧妙的欺騙。總之，這是對人說：「這個樣的！這個樣的！」　　這以下高爾基提到過去的哲學，僅止於說明世界；而今曰大衆所要求的是創造世界。文學必須跟漸進地認識了自己有做那生活的主人的權利的數千萬民衆的「主觀的」眞理相適應。　　「和這眞理不論說些什麼，用什麼話表現，都是或多或少地强化自己掠奪他人勞働的那種「思想的」權利，强化寄生生活的權利——一種巧妙地隱蔽着的個性的野心吧了。這種「人道的」個性，是由於數世紀來法利賽人與Jesuits敎徒，異端亂問者們之宗敎與哲學的說敎所養成的。是和生活的「悲劇」，結了淫蕩的變愛關係，受了病毒，到了無法收拾。那種諷示的（Suggestic）變愛是利已的。這因為把個人「生活苦」與「靈魂」之受難，在各方面强調着，表現着，且肯定這苦難是不可避免的。也許他不　意識的，但總肯定了這苦難的不可避性。這因為要迎俁生活之精神的物質的苦痛之基本根源——即今日小市民認為最神聖的母親，那「財產，妖魔」所造成的人類之醜行，貪慾，羨望——不能而且也不想喚起生理學的嫌惡與憎恨。這種「變愛」，是利已的。在他們，社會生活的悲劇，是看做的藝術的酸素，藝術家生糙的素材」。但這種「變愛」不僅是利已的。且常是鍾暴的。過　的作家中，是依從「我是悲慘着，也叫讀者悲慘一下」這個原理，從事工作的「客觀主義」乾。這是麻瘋病Lekra患者的憎惡。以自已的病傳給健康的人，作為復仇的人類底憎恨。」　　在此，眞叫我們感寒慓。小市民出身的我們文學者，在過去那種「文學是個人的靈感表現」的原則下，正不知製造出多少有毒的質素。有人解釋「眞實」，是每個作家在其社會生活中所體騐到的「或物」的總和。不錯，這眞實，正是高爾基這裏所指出的「客觀的眞實」。　這裏的問題是非常明白的：在神聖母親「財產妖魔」下所產生的人類　醜行，貪慾，　望　沒有肅清以前，那　作家從與「生活的悲劇」，結了「淫蕩的變愛」，因而體騐到的「眞實」，除傳給另人　病毒以外，洞天福地有什麼呢？在我以為：每個作家在必須忠實自己的主觀以前，還須「整理自己」，「改組自己」吧。至少也要叫自己做創造生活的大衆才行。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言日本的烟幕彈  齊　　日俄關係，近日電訊傳來，形勢頗爲緊張，大有戰爭即在目前之概，其實此種觀察，完全受人愚弄，受人欺騙，眞是不大而特差。　　據法報論遠東時局，謂日俄各具弱點，决不致酸成大戰，又據庫倫電稱，東京無綫電所發消息，謂蒙滿邊境，發生新衝突云云，完全不確，蓋蒙滿邊界，自二月十二日發生衝突後，並無新衝突發生，由此觀之，可見滿蒙邊界之種種險惡形勢，均是一種空氣作用，是一個烟幕彈。　　但是這個烟幕彈的發出，其中必定有許多妙用，一方面借了這個題目，拚命地向華北發展，作爲防赤的根據地，一方面對於列强，亦有一種說法，亦有一種交代，說這是我們爲防赤工作必要的條件，因爲赤色恐怖，是列强看了最頭痛的一件事。　　其實强隣要强佔我國的士地，隨時隨事可以借了一個題目來發揮，爲什麼定要在這個時侯來借題發揮呢？其間耶穌亦自有道理，現在俄國的情勢，確實不敢開戰，　新五年計劃尚未成功，　恐白俄搗亂，　德國正在重整軍備，恐德國之襲其後。日本看準俄國的弱點，逆料其不敢開戰，但不妨借此題目，爲聲東擊西之舉。　　至於列强，現在爲意阿戰爭，尚在難分難解之勢，决决顧不到遠東問題，此正予日入攫取殖民地的絕好機會，雖電訊傳來的消息，有謂英美合作，業已成功，有謂美參議員痛詆日本之侵略政策，英國極爲贊同，其實此種言論，也多是一種空氣作用，於我國實際上毫無關係，日本看凖此點，認爲時不可失，决意積極下手。　　日本放出的烟幕彈，原因卽在於此，但是如綁赴法塲的我國，眞是悉聽劊子手的下手呢？還是卽死也應該吐出口氣，死得明白一些才是？晨之歌  西蒙　　對於郊外的自然野景，我是不知怎樣地在渴念和羨慕着。爲了長久沉浸在都會的頽廢生話中，每日里只敎繁雜的市聲擾亂心靈，卑俗的物質慾念充滿整個的腦子，兩條腿彷彿長了瘤子，懶得動一動似的，怎麼着也不想跨出這惡濁穢臭的領域。因之漫說有機會接觸接觸自然界美麗的風物，吸口新鮮空氣，濾濾窒悶的胸懷：甚至卽連一個最平常的，祇消起身早點便可以領略它的姿態的早晨，我也還是十分隔膜而生疏的。　　這生活多値得咒詛與嘆惜。　　當我有一天在一個夜遊魔窟直消磨到天亮，纔拖着累極的身子走出門外，滯鈍地邁步街上，迎面括來一陣嫩寒的曉風，入雖已疲倦得差些倒下去，而這陣風像是一股活力，把昏迷的精神抖擻着使我頓然感到異樣，淸醒而有勁起來一下子似乎全搖落了一夜來難堪的困怠。於是我忘記剛才要急急趕回家去睡覺的心中，緊迫的需要，信步緩緩往前走，眼睛眺望着淡淡的溫和的朝陽跳躍在屋尖上，店舖的門牆上。　　來到都市三年了，這長長的日子，我竟是第一趟在早晨的陽光里走着。不禁自覺好笑。同時更深深地意識着一向所過生活的荒淫糜爛。無生氣。一邊在暗暗讚嘆早晨的活潑，淸朗，以及給予心身上一種舒泰的感受的力量。可是，三年來，我却絕隔了它，几几乎不知有早晨的存在，我有些悵然了。　　而早晨的美態恬靜，是越足令人神往的：它沒有夜晚太多的呌你憎厭的暗影，也沒有日中太多紛纏着你的囂張的車輛聲與各種騷動的音響。平素爲熙攘的忙亂的人，足步，車馬的飛馳所佔領著的，常常會使人擠軋在人潮裡走，也走不上去的大街，現在是回復了它的閒適，幽靜，躺在柔光的沐浴中，讓你大步子自由地跑着。决沒誰來攔在前面，或打後頭突然有人的肩胛碰上背膊來。至於早程的路人是寥落的，大家的臉上都顯示着愉快，活躍的神色。此外只有呌賣報紙的小孩子，混合了電車叮可噹噹的單調鈴音從耳邊擦過。也許你仍還引爲嫌惡，但如果連這聲息也停北，你不將又會以爲過於寂寞了？　　晨的到來是聖潔，純白，不染絲毫汚穢的意味，等待到了日中，人便開始各樣自私的爭奪，可憐有如蛆蟲那樣渾噩的活動，或者痛苦的掙扎；而等待到了夜晚，每一個角落里，更是隨處塡塞了陰溝的詭秘，醜劣的事，屈辱的事，以及呻吟，喘息，惡鬼般人魔的猙臉相，…一切的一切。　　只有晨是偉大的，它掙化了罪孽的人間。松坎  尤其　　—好！好！日頭又爬出了雲端嘍！老張用自己的那根拐杖向偏西的太陽指着，裂開了嘴，下巴上的鬍子動了。　　順着拐杖，伕子們隨便的仰望一下天空，會心的，把微笑噙在嘴里，企望的在計劃着—今天的牙祭如果能有斤半，哼，一斤白煮，半斤炒肉絲，飽餐牠一頓，姻館里來上兩三盒膏子，那才够勁呢！　　想着，計劃着，腿下的脚步便加速的在意念下進行了。　　五點剛打過，毒烈的日頭照射着大地的山野，一切的野草，樹枝，雨水在閃着點點的金星，蟬兒又在沒命的喊了。我們這一夥齊集在松坎的口子上。　　左手，是從爬抓溪澗流里滾下來的山泉，可是寬了，像浦江一樣，水色那麼渾黃，蜿蜓的，從看不盡端的那一頭，把一條帶子拉下來，向看不盡端的另一頭拉下去。右手呢？依然的是一道屛嶂樣的山壁，連直着，埋沒在看不到頭的邊際里。松坎，這小小的鎭市，是築在山與水交流的中間的。　　—黃先生，到稅局騐照　王老張對於這一切的手續是非常淸楚的。　　—走，咱一陣去！阿黃拖子我和老張，共同的跨進了靠左面第二間的屋子。　　不用說，那房里的佈置够簡單的，除了應用的幾張陳舊桌椅和一些文具之外，只有三兩個人在裏面來去的閑步着，看著從這條路上往來的行旅。　　把護照交給他們，不等他們的盤問，預先告訴着我們是從那里來，預備往什麼地方去的那一套老調。有一位小個子的接過來看一下，沉思一回，彷彿有什麼疑慮似的—　　—×××，也來了麼？終於，他耐不住心頭的思慮，開口了。　　沒有，還在後面，我們先把這些東西送到省城。　　—他什麼時候來？　　—那到沒有一定。　　對答的方式，又使他沉思了一會，最後，他跟着我們走出來，把包簍上所揷的旂子端詳一回，並且，點一下東西的件數，在一個小本子上不知劃了點什麼，才走進去了。我們揚起了泥土路上的灰塵，像戰勝了的騎士一樣，擁進了這一條靠山的長街。　　這地方，是一個重鎭，無論在人口上以及建築上，都比經過的鄉鎭來得繁盛，牠沒有支路，沿着兩面的山和水，讓房屋緊排成了兩條直的長列，零用的貨色，在這裏是比較方便些了。眞的，這是黔省的一個重鎭呵！　　落棧，在街中心的一家店裏，自然，在我們是有無限的歡喜，還有兩天，計算一下，桐梓縣城，從那裏進省，有長途汽車，可以不用入力來代步了。可是伕子呢？整個的憂鬱撲擊着他個，兩天的日子是快的，在交卸了責任以後，下脚的生路還不知道在那裏飄懸着呢！　　天晚了，幕靄的彩雲包圍了由尖，全部的夫子緊纏着阿黃，眼睛的光是可怕的。　　雪白的銀洋攤在桌子上，算盤珠在阿黃的手指下不停的播弄着，漆黑的眼珠子開始的混沌，被蟬翼的輕紗蒙着，模糊了，無數的銀星在飛跳。　　—黃先生，這回就兩斤吧！一個伕子懇求着。　　—都小用吭氣（註），賞罰自有分明。樣子，是眞够老練的。　　結果，普通的每人斤半，幾位轎夫，爲了爬抓溪上的勞苦，每人分到了兩斤多。　　他們笑着走了，計劃着如何的支配那分到的犒勞。　　晚飯以後，閑散的在街上走走，死寂的空氣，在這裏是比較好些的，聽着流動的水聲，聽着街上人的閑談，笑語，聽着人們手裏蒲扇的輕巧聲韻，聽着嗚嗚呌的蚊子，下意識的想到—　　—這裏的蛟子，怕也不是容易對付的吧？　　註：吭氣，卽說話之意。</p>

<p>廣東餐館  林娜　　離老甫曼漁村不遠的一個椰林地帶，有一個美國兵，這兵房里有一連福瑪海港砲台的駐防軍。這個漁村平常是充滿了荒凉和靜寞的，人們嬾嫩的在街上跑着，兩旁的低房子也嬾嬾的站立着，甚至於從海港吹來的海風也是嬾孃的：但是一到休息假日，這村便從疲憊里甦醒過來了，福瑪砲台的駐防兵們一大早便成羣結隊地在村里露面，有彈手風琴的，有牽狗的，也有沿途哼着舞踏曲，光着頭，高揚着兵帽亂跳亂舞的。而在村屋那一家廣東人開的餐館，碰杯，刀又撞擊聲更淸晰的嚮了出來，幾至於全村都能聽見。　　老板是一個大胖子，在密集的人叢里露着他底肥面，笑容可掬地一會向這個擺擺手恭敬的喊：的翰大佐！一會又向那個握握手呌聲：羅斯瑪少尉！大佐和少尉，在這兒幷不是官級的名稱，而是爲着表示敬意和諂媚，被呌的人便張開了嘴驕傲的笑着，好像自己眞已做了大佐或者少尉了。而老板也因此而在銀行里存着三千多存欵，村里人說這個餐館老板的錢財，是從他底握手，媚笑，喊大佐少尉里發起來的。　　雖說是澄淸的碧空上還掛着一輪溫煦的大白日，然而，這家餐室里的電燈却已全被扭亮，留聲機也被一個小侍役專伺着，唱的嗚嗚咽咽的，在那十幾桌舖着白罩布的餐桌上，便黑越越的塞滿了人，有的站了起來高舉着盃爲祖個亞美利加和仁慈的總統羅斯福祝福，有的便迷細着一隻眼睛，側着頭，在聽着留聲機，一隻手伸出了兩個指頭，在桌上節奏地敲着，有的便把中間的桌子搬開一兩隻，騰出一塊空地來，隨便的挾起一隻凳子跳起交際舞來。終是就連那個瞇細了眼珠子，嘻嘻笑着，管錢櫃的女侍者，肥胖的廣東老板，瘦削的管留聲機小侍役，廚師以及塞在店門外凑熱鬧的閑什人也被拖出來，摟住腰幹，瘋狂的跳着舞着，老板在他肥滿的額角上沁着汗珠，女侍者則堵起嘴驕聲驕氣的呌着：「要命的啊！約翰大佐……」大佐醉眼忪惺向她看着，把手在她屁股上捏了一把；於是乎她尖呌着，逗的滿屋子人都哄然大笑。葡萄酒，威士忌，噴滿了地板和餐桌，整十個頭，張開嘴巴往後抑着，而靜靜地伏在桌底下從兵房帶來的狗，也嗚着鼻子，站起來哀哀的呌。　　送完了一批東倒西歪的醉漢，剛好挽過桌布，新的一批又來了。他們同樣地要求着老板給與他們以光榮和敬意，同樣地爲祖國亞美利加和仁慈的羅斯福總統乾盃，同樣的挾若老板肥胖的腰幹，揑着女侍者的屁股，等等低級趣味和無意之戈的滿足：然而，老板不能拒絕他，也沒有拒絕他的權利，雖然定可怕地單調的胡鬧動作，會使得他感到自已是在受侮辱了，而想暴怒着時，看見他那塞滿了鈔票，金元，角子的豐滿錢櫃，他微笑了，感動使他顫着手。　　每當這些醉漢們要走，而仙袋里掏出了整疊鈔票，隨隨便便的望櫃台上的女侍者一丟時，老板底面孔熌光了，他會忙搶着說，怕她多找了他們錢：　　「西茜就找給他一角錢吧！」　　在這兒五元的鈔票和一元鈔票，稍不留意往往會被偷常爲一樣價値使用的，不幸發覺了，老板便會述忙陪着笑，說：　　「對不住，安德孫少尉，沒有看淸楚哩！又溫和的回過頭去把里茜駡着：你也眞是，爲什麼沒有看淸啊！我年紀老了，眼力差，你年靑靑的難道和我一樣？……」　　日子在碰盃，哄笑和呼號里過去了，　　來的是靜寂　和　　的黃昏。兵房里吹過了第二遍營號，同時老板送走了他嚴後的一批客人嬾嫩的打了幾個噴嚏，吩咐大家把舖門關了，休息。　　直過半夜，這街是死寂了，還能够淸晰地聽見從他店里發出算盤的浙嗒聲。瞎話  （弟）　　日大使訪俄外長，談判邊境事件，日陸軍欲先解决懸案，然後議訂不侵犯條約，譚老三曰，日本到底要與俄和平談判，並不欲與俄血戰肉搏，前日宣傳，滿蒙邊境，怎樣衝突，怎樣激戰，原來是一片空氣，上當。　　中委馮玉祥李烈鈞等，近向中央建議，大赦全國政治犯，譚老三曰，近日外禍，已如肺病到了第三期，還要鬧什麼政見不政見，凡我中華民國的國民，應該大家起來，一德一心，共同救國，找尋生路。接見（續）  李軒　　爸爸在窗子里邊瞪大了眼睛，很粗的喘着氣，媽掏出手帕來替自己擦淚，以後又矮下身安慰晶子，說爸爸　天就回家了，小鼻子抽噓着，眼包含着淚水注視着爸爸，爸爸輕輕的說：　　「晶是乖孩子，不準哭，」　　晶子不哭了，爸便又對媽媽說：　　「不耍使奶奶常難過，要好好勸她，」　　媽唔唔咽咽的應着，淚仍是不受的束的滾落到袖頭上，鬆了挽着晶子的手，正面的伏在鐵絲網上，向着爸爸：　　「在里邊苦不苦？」　　「還盼望他們施點恩惠嗎？」　　這時另一個被木板關住的小窗子給個醜鬼樣的黑衣胖子打開，那人嚷着：　　「六三六有東西送沒有？」　　媽遞過爸的衣服去，攘着又把一雙冬天的毡鞋子也拿到窗口，黑手把那些東西抓進去，那個小木板就又很快的閉上了。　　晶子摸着自己提的那袋餅餅，張開紅紅的小嘴唇想說什麼，却又害羞的嚥下去，小心里怕着却又思索着：爸爸好久不吃家里的餅餅了呢，末了便不自禁的呌了聲：　　「餅餅！」　　兩隻小手猛的舉起那袋圓圓的餅子貼近窗口，爸爸微有點驚喜的望着媽媽問：　　「晶子從家鄉帶的？」　　「呵，我竟忘了，她記得你頂喜歡吃那個，」　　媽一面說一面抱起晶子來，走到閉得緊緊的小窗口前，請求的：　　「先生，我們再送點東西。」，　　那個醜鬼開開窗板說：　　「什麼？」　　說着，一隻粗粗的黑手伸到品子胸前，晶子在媽懷里搖榥的跺着，驚嚇的大聲呌起來：　　「打你！我給我爸爸！」　　「他媽的！」　　訇！小窗口落下了板子，醜鬼嘟嘟噥噥的駡着，憤憤的扯住爸的胳膊，翻起兩顆大白眼珠怪呌着：　　「走，到時間了！」　　爸爸回過頭來看了看媽，臉色白的非常怕人，媽光聲的哀求着喊了幾聲「先生，」那惡狠狠的醜鬼回身噴了口濃痰，睬也不踩的推着爸爸走，媽念的抓着鐵絲網嚷：　　「到了監獄里寫封家信。」　　爸快被推到屋門口了，回轉身答應了一下，便給另一面墻隔住瞧不見了。　　晶子牽着媽的手，媽的手顫哆哆的抖得厲害，那袋甜的餅餅不知什麼時候　碎在脚底下，走出有警察站着的黑色大門，媽使手帕揩乾了臉上的淚，晶子便問媽媽：　　「爸爸爲什麼不跟我們回家呢？　　（紀念一個友人和他的孩子）播音節目誘惑　劇人播音會無綫電劇本（十三）  劉亞偉編劇　　小和尙：凑巧得很，你們幾個人呢？　　小魯：男女一共四個。　　小和尚：我給你們盛來四碗粥，帶來八個饅頭，吃了再說吧！　　（於是大家超高速度的好像在比賽似的大呑了一頓。）　　阿巧：小魯，你問問他，有沒有什麼醃的東西，怪淡的不大順口呀！　　小魯：得了，吃荒飯還考究什麼味兒呀！　　（走路，此時佛經朗誦已停。）　　小和尚：吃完了沒有？　　大家：多謝師傅的慈悲！　　小和尚：飽了沒有？　　王大娘：飽是說不上，至少是不飽了！　　小和尚：這也難怪，你們餓了好幾天了吧？　　老五：可不是麼！已經快肚皮貼着脊梁子！　　小和尚：我們的常家的已經說了，若是今天你們來不及趕路的話，就在這兒將就一夜得了，不過舖的蓋的最缺乏得很！　　小魯：那倒不要緊，可是趕路……趕到那兒去呀？　　小和尚：明天你們一大早起來，一直往東走，我想頂多走上四里多路，就可以逢着賑災的人了。　　阿巧：那好極了，今天我們就只好借這兒睡了。　　（於是大家相當的樂觀起來。）　　小和尚：我可少陪了，因爲……　　老五：我們知道，已經很對不起你了。　　小和尚：那裏的話，慈悲是出家人的本份，我走了，（走路，關門）　　阿巧：就在這兒睡呀？　　小魯：怎麼？還不知足麼？　　老五：你們瞧，那邊有一個草堆，那不是給我們預備好了的安身的地方麼！　　阿巧：從前我聽我的爸爸告訴我說，和尚招待客人是另外有上房的。　　老五：儍丫頭，我們是逃難的呀！　　小魯：就是平常的客人也享受不着上房睡覺權利呀！　　王大娘：那要怎樣的資格呀？　　老五：那得佈施，是不是小魯？　　小魯：對的，上房就是專門給那些財主預備的，因爲他們有錢捐呢！　　老五：算了，別管閑事了，我疲倦死了！（躺到，草堆上於是伸了一個出聲懶腰。）　　（在這兒草堆上因有累了的原故，所以他們熟睡了一夜。）開篇介紹　　看燈　　燈印月。月印燈。今宵燈月倍分明。團團月下燈千盞。盞盞燈中有月一輪。月下觀燈燈富貴。燈前　月月精神。月借燈光光閃閃。燈乘月色色沉沉。有月無燈月暗淡。有燈無月燈凄淸。今宵燈光月夜裏。無非賞月賞燈人。（副白）大少爺，今朝看燈，請　大少爺講些古典撥拉伲聽。（白）好阿，（副白）該面四盞啥個燈。（白）叫做漁樵耕讀（副白）漁樵耕讀，魚阿是姜太公釣魚，（白）非也，（副白）格　啥個釣魚，（唱）乃是光武年間歸隱事。乖釣江灘嚴子陵。（白）嚴子陵釣魚，樵來战，（唱）樵是，無情逼休崔氏女。運蹇樵柴朱買臣。（白）耕來哉，（唱）耕是，大舜歷山耕種久。敎民紡織敎民耕。（白）漁樵耕讀，現在看到落末一盞讀（副白）大少爺讀是啥個名堂，（唱）讀乃是，刺股懸樑蘇季子。他是，陰符熟讀太公經。（副白）該搭四盞啥個名堂。（白）叫風花雪月。（副白）風是　啥個風，（唱）風是，張良助漢將風箏放。吹散，江東的子弟兵。（副白）花是哈物是。　　以上接第五版</p>

<p>Nanjing, February 20th. The Central Propaganda Department hosted the press corps at 3:00 PM today, with over sixty attendees. Fang Zhi gave an impromptu report, stating that a few individuals are attempting to exploit the patriotic zeal of the people to achieve their own conspiracies. Fearing that the people would be unaware and fall into their trap, the department issued a letter to the people on the 11th, exposing their conspiracies. The press corps amplified and elucidated this, enabling the people to deeply recognize the current national crisis, the deliberate disruptive conspiracies of a few individuals, and the proper path to patriotism. The department's staff is very gratified. The current national crisis is increasingly severe, and the calls for national salvation and trust in the government are correspondingly louder. The Party should further invigorate and strive to shoulder its responsibilities. However, the national crisis is the result of gradual accumulation, and the grand plan for national salvation is not a task for a single day. In this critical environment, the work of national salvation depends on the unity of the upper and lower levels, common efforts, synchronized steps, and unified will. In the process of cultivating a strong force to engage in the national salvation movement, two points should be noted:</p>
<p>- Eliminate the remnants of the Red bandits.</p>
<p>- We should possess a sincere, vigorous, and calm spirit. When encountering anything that hinders this spirit, we should study the country's recent environment and its origins and engage in effective, rational, and legal struggles. The department's recent letter to the people is intended to alert the people, so that under the leadership of the Party and the government, they can be of one heart and one mind to save the nation and ensure its survival. According to investigations, the general patriotic groups agree with all points in the letter and can rigorously examine the members within their own groups. Those who originally had patriotic sincerity but were infiltrated by reactionary elements, resulting in misunderstandings, have even voluntarily disbanded and sought normal paths to patriotism, showing admirable courage to extricate themselves. However, there are still a very small number of people who are incorrigible and unrepentant. It is hoped that they will reconsider and not bring about their own destruction, leading to legal sanctions by the government. The press corps, as arbiters of public opinion, are expected to earnestly propagate and advise. As the third year of the New Life Movement begins, President Chiang's instructions on the goals and key points of future New Life Movement emphasize "the resolution to be reborn from death" and "the spirit of seeking truth from facts," which should be followed by modern citizens and those engaged in the national salvation movement. The purpose of the New Life Movement is to revive the nation, which is the national salvation movement. It is hoped that the press corps will widely publicize this.

<p>Nanjing, February 20th. Order from the National Government: All modern nations that aim to strengthen national power and revive the nation invariably prioritize strict maintenance of order. Once social order is disrupted, the nation will be in danger even without foreign aggression. In recent years, our country has faced frequent calamities, and it is imperative for all levels to unite, invigorate, and strive together for orderly efforts. Although various laws and regulations already provide detailed regulations for maintaining public security, there is concern that the provisions for prohibitions are scattered throughout various laws, making it easy for enforcers to be negligent. Therefore, these emergency measures for maintaining public security are specially promulgated to make the military and police authorities throughout the country aware of what to pay attention to. They are to be used to quickly deal with those who deliberately harm society and the nation at the moment of incitement. All prohibitions are actions that violate existing criminal law and other laws and regulations, and all instructions are the responsibilities that public security organs should fulfill according to law. After the order is promulgated, it should be strictly enforced immediately to ensure the security of the public and the strong protection of people who abide by the law. This order,</p>
<p>Emergency Measures for Maintaining Public Security:</p>
<p>- In the event of any disturbance of order, incitement of riots, sabotage of transportation, or other events that endanger the country, the military and police responsible for public security may use force or other effective methods to stop them.</p>
<p>- In the event that any of the aforementioned crimes are promoted through writing, drawing, speeches, or other methods, arrests may be made on the spot, and resistance may be overcome with force or other effective methods when necessary.</p>
<p>- The military and police should immediately disperse gatherings and parades that hinder order or incite the public, and arrest the leaders and those who resist dispersal.</p>
<p>- In the event of any of the aforementioned events, the military and police should immediately disarm and arrest those carrying weapons on the spot and search for and arrest suspects.</p>
<p>- Anyone who knowingly hides, harbors, or helps to conceal a person who has violated these measures may be arrested.</p>
<p>- The military and police should immediately report to their superior officer in charge when dealing with incidents. The arrested criminals should be immediately sent to the nearest commander of the military police, director of the public security bureau, or prosecutor for interrogation. They should be dealt with according to the Emergency Measures for Punishing Those Who Endanger the Republic of China or other criminal laws and regulations, depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>- The military and police handling incidents in accordance with these measures should provide special protection to people who strictly abide by the law and should pay attention to maintaining public security and restoring order. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e15">Full Text of Chairman Chiang's Instructions at New Life Movement Commemoration Meeting; Should Cultivate Habits of Mutual Assistance and Cooperation; Practice New Life of Universal Love and Sociability <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing (Continued from yesterday). The ancients said, "Leading without orders," and "Teaching without words," which is this principle. We must understand that the effectiveness of teaching without words is so great, and strive to implement the education of "leading by example," then we can promote the New Life Movement. Each comrade attending today bears the responsibility of teaching at least dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of people, and the capital is a place to be observed by both Chinese and foreigners, a place to set a national example. If everyone can lead by example, thoroughly transforming their own families and the agencies, schools, or organizations under their management, so that our children, subordinates, and students can practice the New Life Movement, I think we can certainly set an example so that the New Life Movement can be truly promoted throughout the country. Fourth, we must promote the New Life Movement with the sincerity of "mutual assistance and cooperation." The ancients said, "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world," and "If you want to establish yourself, establish others; if you want to achieve yourself, achieve others." Promoting the New Life Movement is a matter that concerns the rise and fall of the country, and is the responsibility that everyone should fulfill. It is a work that establishes oneself and others, and is the task that everyone should strive for. As revolutionary party members, to transform society and build the country, we must first transform people's hearts and reform social customs and habits. The responsibility for promoting the New Life Movement is especially significant. Whenever and wherever, as long as we think of or see something that does not meet the requirements of the New Life Movement or the habits of modern life, we must immediately take responsibility and strive to reform it, without any excuse or delay. If our intellectuals take it upon themselves to correct people's hearts and transform society, I believe that our society and country, not to mention having gone through 25 years, even just since the advocacy of the New Life Movement for these two years, would not have progressed so slowly. In the past, the situation was that each individual did not fulfill their responsibility, or even did not know their responsibility at all. At best, they could only practice the New Life Movement themselves. As for how others are, how society is, they no longer cared. Teachers only knew to teach classes, and staff in various agencies only knew to go to the office every day. On the way to school or the office, no matter what they saw, they were indifferent. These past two days, it has rained and snowed in the capital. The raincoats and actions of the rickshaw pullers are the reality of their lives, and it doesn't resemble life at all. When foreigners come to our capital to see, they don't need to look at other things, just seeing the way of life of the rickshaw pullers can see through the ignorance of our people, the backwardness of society, and the lack of government capacity, and can indirectly infer that our country will not last long in the current world. Now it is not easy for us to expect ordinary rickshaw pullers to automatically achieve neatness and cleanliness, and given their poor circumstances and lack of knowledge, many things are really not their fault. But where are our responsible people, especially the municipal government, the police department, and the people in charge? Why are they indifferent to these situations and not thinking of ways to correct them, help them, and make them look a little better? As long as our competent authorities take some responsibility and put in some thought, this matter can definitely be done. But unfortunately, everyone regards it as irrelevant to themselves, and even the competent authorities shirk responsibility from each other, not knowing where the responsibility lies. So, no one has ever devised a way to improve things. How can we promote the New Life Movement in this way? Everyone should know that the New Life Movement certainly starts with our own practice, but it does not mean that it is over once we have done it ourselves. If we think that as long as we can practice the New Life Movement ourselves, or if we think that as long as our personal food, clothing, housing, and transportation conform to propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame, that is enough, this can only be said to ordinary people. But as intellectuals, we must never be satisfied with this. The biggest problem of ordinary Chinese people is the so-called "sweeping the snow in front of one's own door," only knowing about oneself and not knowing about others, only knowing about selfishness and not knowing about mutual assistance and cooperation. That is, they do not know how to socialize and be social, do not know how to love their compatriots. From the perspective of cultivation, it is a lack of training in "social education." From the perspective of mentality, it is a lack of "sympathy," and the loss of the spirit of "universal love" and "mutual assistance." Ordinary people are satisfied as long as they are able to wear warm clothes and eat their fill, and no longer think about how the general compatriots in society are, let alone how the country and nation will be a hundred or a thousand years later. If the ordinary thoughts of ordinary people are like this, then how are the ordinary behaviors of ordinary people? Chinese people often see people falling into the water and just watch from the shore. When they see a fire, they just stand far away and watch the fun. When they encounter someone who has fallen ill on the road, they may take a look and turn away, never thinking of a way to rescue them. There are also many people who, when they see someone having bad luck, not only do not sympathize or help, but also gloat over their misfortune. When they see someone doing good things, not only do they not encourage or assist, but also hinder, ridicule, and envy them from the sidelines. Thoughts and behaviors of this kind of base, selfish, cold-blooded, and ruthless nature are almost everywhere. If we cannot effectively reform this bad habit and restore the Chinese people's inherent virtues of benevolence, trustworthiness, and social ethics, and promote the inherent spirit of "loving the multitude and being close to the benevolent," so that compatriots throughout the country, at any time and in any place, can know propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame, and love, help, and cooperate with each other, I think that no matter how vast our country is or how long our history is, it will be difficult to escape the example of extinction. Everyone should know that there has never been a person in the world who can live in isolation. Therefore, from the perspective of the entire interconnected relationship of social life, there is actually no such thing as an "individual," only a "member of society and the nation." Since we cannot escape the existence in heaven and earth and survive independently, as long as we are a person, we must be a social person, must live a social life of mutual assistance and cooperation, and must live a collective life of advising on wrongs and encouraging good. Since we are social people and live social lives, we must have the virtue of loving the group, the ability to socialize, and the thought of benefiting and enjoying the group. Only in this way can we be called a "person," and can we survive in this scientifically developed, socially advanced, and interconnected modern era. Therefore, only a person of universal love and sociability is a modern person, and can establish a modern country. Therefore, in the future, whenever we discover the slightest shortcomings in society or see the various abuses of the government, we should report them frankly to the competent authorities, regardless of each other, so that they can be corrected. Because, in order for politics and society to progress and improve quickly, there must be social leaders, especially the intellectual class, who must be responsible for contributing in order to achieve the goal of reform. Because the transformation of the country and society cannot be achieved solely by the power of the government, it must rely on the collective wisdom and efforts of society to achieve satisfactory results. Therefore, modern education, in addition to "moral education," "intellectual education," and "physical education," must also pay special attention to "social education." The New Life Movement that I am now advocating also pays special attention to the cultivation of sociality, so that the general public can promote the spirit of universal love, enhance the virtue of sociability, cultivate the habit of mutual assistance and cooperation, and increase the effectiveness of working together. Therefore, the "New Life" is a life of loving the group, a life of sociability, a life in which compatriots throughout the country love, help, and cooperate with each other. This cooperative and sociable life is the "New Life" that we are talking about. If our compatriots can reform all the past selfish and self-interested lives and everyone can practice this New Life of universal love and sociability, I believe that it will be very easy to build a modern New Nation. Therefore, if the New Life Movement can be widely promoted and truly achieved, it can save the country and revive the nation. I have already explained the meaning of the New Life Movement and the methods of promoting it very clearly in the past. Today, taking advantage of this second anniversary gathering, I would like to repeat the above points, especially the importance of social training, and tell you to work hard according to them. Then the New Life Movement can achieve practical results, and your hard work will not be in vain. When the New Life Movement is finally successful, our New Nation can be built, and today can become a major memorial day for the revival of the nation. I hope that everyone will work together to complete the mission of the New Life Movement. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e19">Birth Control Movement and the Population Problem <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>It is reported that Mrs. Sanger of the United States will arrive in Shanghai on the 23rd to promote the birth control movement. Decades ago, Mrs. Sanger came to our country. Now she is revisiting this old place. The people of our country should have a deeper understanding of Mrs. Sanger's advocacy. According to reports, when Mrs. Sanger passed through Hong Kong, she was publicly criticized by Pastor Chang, who pointed out that this would result in a degradation of sexual morals. Leaving aside the rights and wrongs of religious and ethical debates for now, in recent years, birth control has become a public movement in European and American countries. Whether this movement is suited to China's needs is also worth studying. Therefore, let us examine it from the perspective of China's population problem.</p>
<p>Firstly, the most serious problem of import surplus in our country today is food. This alone requires the export of over 100 million yuan in cash every year. It is obvious that our country's food production is not sufficient to meet the needs of our own population. This phenomenon may be the result of the decline of agriculture in our country, but the expansion of the population should also be an important reason. Secondly, there may not be much hope for the expansion of arable land in China. Although the land area of China is said to be over 4 million square li, mountains and deserts occupy two-thirds of it, and the land most suitable for cultivation below 500 meters is only 600,000 square li, accounting for only 14% of the total area. Even if the uncultivated land is developed, the increase will be minimal. According to research, the arable land currently available for development in our country (including hills and plateaus) may not exceed the number of already cultivated land, and the average arable land owned by each farmer in our country is only three and a half mu. Even if all the wasteland is fully developed, each person would only get five or six mu. However, according to the population scholar Kuchinsky, each farmer should have at least ten Chinese mu to maintain a living. Therefore, even if the wasteland is fully developed, the food problem and the farmer problem may not be solved.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the strength of a country lies not in the size of its population but in the quality of its citizens. To improve the quality of the citizens, one is to implement eugenics policies, and the other is to popularize education and improve the cultural level of the people. Only then can we hope that the people are healthy and promising and can compete with foreign races in the world today. Looking at the first point, as a result of excessive births among the general population in our country, not only does the mortality rate increase, but the physical quality of the people is also becoming increasingly weak. Looking at the second point, the majority of the population in our country is farmers, and the key to national education lies in the farmers. However, the average land owned by each farmer in our country is only three and a half mu. If the annual income per mu is fifteen yuan, then the annual income is only a few dozen yuan. Using this to support the family is already a struggle, so where is there spare capacity to educate their children?</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that the inability of the increase in population and food production in our country to adjust to each other is the most serious problem today. Although solving it requires efforts in many aspects, promoting the birth control movement to slightly reduce the suffering of excessive births among the people will also be of some help in solving the above problem.</p>

Furthermore, after each conflict occurs, the Kwantung Army must fabricate facts, saying that the Soviet border guards attacked the territory of Manchukuo. It also said that various misunderstandings are all caused by the unclear border. The newspaper quoted the words of the Kwantung Army Headquarters, "The border must be determined based on historical materials and actual circumstances," and said, "The Kwantung Army and Manchukuo are standing in a frank position here, making people understand the reasons for the constant disturbance of our country's borders. The Japanese military has been trying for several years to destroy various efforts to adjust Soviet-Japanese relations. The agreement on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway is hated by the military, as they are deeply afraid that this agreement will ease the tense relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, and allow the Soviet government to agree to the organization of a border mixed committee to restrain and resolve border conflicts." The newspaper pointed out that the committee was proposed by the Japanese government. They want to make the world forget their refusal to sign a public non-aggression pact on December 1932. They want to create a Soviet-Japanese "Manchukuo" committee, and the Soviet government agreed to start negotiations. "Unfortunately, the Japanese government had no intention of realizing its proposal. At that time, there was already opposition to this proposal from the military. The above news was fully confirmed after the Soviet government submitted a detailed plan for the organization of a border committee to the Japanese government on August 1935. The Japanese government did not respond to this plan. The military tried to undermine this proposal, creating a theory that the Soviet-Manchurian border was unclear and that a committee must be organized to determine the border. The Kwantung Army Headquarters used the unclear border as a reason for their invasion of Soviet territory. Therefore, they are more afraid of the true adjustment of Soviet-Japanese relations than anything else, and that is why they oppose the proposal to organize a border mixed committee, trying to prolong the time so that they can create conflicts in the present or future under the pretext of the undetermined border without any scruples. There is almost no doubt about this. At the same time, the Japanese government and the military are well aware that this border has long been clearly stipulated in the Sino-Russian treaties, which are attached with maps clearly delineating the boundary line. To this day, there are still people saying that the border has not been determined, which must be reckless and ignorant. The whole world knows that before the Japanese army arrived in Manchuria, there had never been any conflicts due to the unclear border, even during the Zhang Zuolin era, who implemented an anti-Soviet policy. The Kwantung Army's Manchurian mouthpiece is trying to cover up their excuses with Article 7 of the Beijing Treaty and Article 3 of the Shenyang Treaty." The newspaper continued to quote the full text of the above treaties, and continued, "Without waiting for international law experts, only preliminary knowledge is needed to know that the so-called redetermination of the border shows that not only was the boundary line determined on the treaties, but boundary markers were also erected, and the so-called redetermination of the border is only to add supplements to the necessary areas because the boundary markers are incomplete. What can be allowed here is that the Beijing and Shenyang treaties quoted above clearly stipulate that the redetermined boundary line must be respected. Everyone knows that this obligation has been repeatedly violated by the Japanese-Manchukuo army, but before the Japanese army arrived in Manchuria, both sides were able to maintain and abide by this fully clear boundary line. If the boundary markers have been damaged somewhere, technical methods must be used to restore or add boundary markers, and this demarcation work can be carried out in a calm state together, and it must never be carried out by attacks, provocations, and other barbaric acts. We have sufficient reason to assert that these conflicts are not due to the so-called unclear border, but intentional provocations to create the concept of an unclear border, and to force the modification of the boundary line under this pretext, but the Soviet Union will never allow anyone to deceive us. Therefore, the basic mistake of the Manchukuo army lies in brazenly violating the Shenyang and Beijing treaties, because they cannot respect the existing boundaries and attempt to use force and barbaric methods of invading Soviet territory to modify them. Now that Japan mentions the Shenyang and Beijing treaties, we do not hesitate to repeat that the Manchukuo government not only fails to abide by these treaties' obligations regarding the border, but also does not respect other obligations at all. Article 6 of the Beijing Treaty and Article 5 of the Shenyang Treaty stipulate that it is not allowed to attempt to use force to oppose the organization, existence, or activities of the other party's government. However, the Manchukuo authorities directly help and protect the White Russian bandit organization, openly adopting various methods to oppose the Soviet government. They are also supplied with money and weapons by the Manchukuo authorities and Japanese military commissioners to invade Soviet territory, as seen recently in Irkutsk and Menli. We can further tell them that the Shenyang Treaty is also attached with a declaration stipulating that it is necessary to find ways to prevent the activities or stop the work of former Russian subjects, namely the White Guards, because their existence or activities endanger the interests of the Soviet Union. The Japanese and Manchukuo authorities widely use White Party bandits as police, secret police, and soldiers, far beyond the time of the treaties. Can they immediately prepare to eliminate these White Parties? No one can blame the Soviet government for lacking goodwill in signing agreements on various unresolved issues, but we must wait for the other party to have the same goodwill."

<p>Tokyo: The election for cleaning up the environment has ended, and at 7:00 AM on the 20th, the voting in all 122 constituencies across the country, with more than 14,000 polling stations, began simultaneously. On the 21st, elections will be held in 62 districts, and on the 22nd, the remaining districts will all count the votes. Late that night, the results of the national vote are expected to be known. On that day, 1.2 million eligible voters in the six electoral districts of Tokyo City voted. In the 35 districts within the new and old city, a total of 186 polling stations began voting simultaneously at 7:00 AM. The situation was generally good. By 9:00 AM, 161,382 people had voted, and by 11:00 AM, 329,176 people had voted. By noon, it had reached 30% of the total, and by 1:00 PM, it had exceeded 40%. (20th Domei Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The weather is fine today, which is perfect for the election. Therefore, many voters have arrived, and the rate of abstention is greatly reduced. The vote counting for all constituencies should be completed on the 23rd. Based on a comprehensive observation of all aspects and a fair judgment, although the Seiyukai Party has decreased somewhat, even if the Minseito Party makes comprehensive progress, the position of the first party may still be occupied by the Seiyukai Party, but the difference in the number of members between the two parties will be at most ten or more people. The power of the Doumei-kai and the Showa-kai is slightly less than before the dissolution of the parliament. The proletarian faction has made great progress, jumping to occupy a dozen or so seats, which is a significant change. (20th Domei Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to the announcement by the Criminal Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Justice, the number of reports of illegal election activities from February 19 to the present has reached 514 across the country. Among those prosecuted, those who violated the law by accepting bribes account for more than 80%. The authorities plan to severely punish the actual criminals and will begin formal prosecution on the 21st. It is expected that the number of those prosecuted will increase sharply.

<p>London: Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Robert Caldecott, previously organized a commission of inquiry regarding the ban on keeping maids, and compiled a report, which was handed over to the Privy Council for consideration. The committee has submitted a report. When the House of Commons recently convened, a member again questioned Colonial Secretary Thomas on this issue, saying, "According to the report of the Examination Committee, the practice of keeping maids in Hong Kong is indeed inhumane, but the conclusion is that all prohibition measures will ultimately fail. Will the government accept this opinion, or will it implement the policy of abolishing maids advocated by previous governments?" Thomas replied, "The examination report has been read, and I also feel that the matter of keeping maids is inhumane. However, I dare not agree that this evil practice, which is prevalent in the land under our laws, cannot be stopped. It has long been concluded that the practice of keeping maids in Hong Kong is illegal. All previous governments have hoped that it would be completely abolished, and I am also continuing to work hard to achieve the purpose of abolishing it as soon as possible." Then, other members continued to raise questions, saying, "What steps has the government taken to ensure that the practice of keeping maids will eventually be abolished?" Thomas replied, "The government is starting with inspections. If there is solid evidence, we will prosecute, and there have been many cases of punishment. In the future, those who keep maids may be imprisoned." (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e24">British Bomber Crashes Outside of a French Port, Falling into the Sea, Three People Missing <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>London: This morning, a British Air Force bomber, which was practicing at sea for the effect of transmitting messages in a vast winter war scenario, suddenly crashed outside of the French port of Le Havre. Of the four people on board, two are missing, and are still being searched for. It is feared that they have already died. Only Officer Page floated in the water for half an hour and was rescued alive. According to reports, he and his companions were lost in the dark. Because the gasoline was exhausted, they were looking for a place to land, but they unexpectedly crashed into the sea. At that time, the radio operator sent out a call for help, but it seems that no French radio station intercepted it. It was not until a British radio station intercepted it that it was transmitted to the Saint-Inglevert radio station in northern France, and the station notified Le Havre by telephone. After receiving the news, Le Havre dispatched a lifeboat to search for it. At the same time, two French people were startled by the sound of the airplane and knew that something was wrong, so they drove a leaky small boat in the dark to the place where the light was coming from, and saw Page swimming towards the shore. They quickly threw a lifebuoy. Page tied it to his body and was floated to the shore by the waves, thus escaping danger. Not long after, the damaged aircraft was found 200 yards from the shore, half-submerged in the water. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Hong Kong: At 6:00 PM on the 20th, Ross held a reception for the Chinese and Western press in the Governor's Office, stating briefly that after arriving in Guangzhou on the 21st, he would meet with local authorities and bankers to investigate the economy of Guangdong. He would return to Hong Kong on the 24th and return to Shanghai on the Empress of Russia on the 26th. China's monetary system is now on a stable footing. International loans to China are not currently in progress. Under fair conditions, British goods are not worried about Japanese goods dumping. Britain and Japan will hold meetings to seek solutions to Far East problems. This decision to come south has nothing to do with Hong Kong's finances. Ross also said that the connection of the Guangzhou-Kowloon and Guangzhou-Hankou railways is a certainty. After the connection is implemented, China's export trade will benefit greatly, because goods can directly reach Hong Kong. Since transportation costs are low, it is easy to compete with foreign goods. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Ross took the Tai Shan wheel to Guangzhou on the evening of the 20th, arriving on the morning of the 21st, and is scheduled to stay for four days, returning to Hong Kong on the 24th, without going to Guilin. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: British economic envoy Sir Frederick Leith-Ross told the Associated Press reporter today that the unification of China's currency is a necessary condition for the development of trade, and that there is room for foreign loans only after the Nanjing government's finances and politics are stable. The envoy continued, "British investment in China will be greater than in the previous forty years. From his point of view, China's financial plans have every hope of success, and its trade with the United States also has every possibility of progress. At present, Japan has gained the most from trade with China, but other countries are not unable to compete with it." (10th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Rome – The Italian newspaper, Il Giornale d'Italia, today published a document purportedly a secret report from Sir Maffey, an official in the British Colonial Office, to the British Foreign Office regarding the attitude that Britain should adopt towards Italy's ambitions in Abyssinia. (20th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Rome – Last spring, when the Italian-Abyssinian dispute became serious and war had not yet broken out, the British Cabinet appointed a committee to study British interests in Abyssinia and whether they would be affected by Italy's policy towards Abyssinia. The committee submitted a report after completing its work, but it has not been published for nearly a year. The semi-official Il Giornale d'Italia has learned the contents of this report and published an abstract without any criticism, but its nature is shocking. It is said that the report's core point is that "British interests in Abyssinia are not vital. Even if Italy conquers Abyssinia, Britain does not need to resist." The report also stated that at the beginning of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, Italy had discussions with the British government aimed at "exchanging views on the interests of both countries in Abyssinia to seek development under conditions of mutual harmony." At that time, Italian Embassy Counselor Guido Sante De Ritis had explained the contents of the "secret agreement between Italy and France regarding Abyssinia" (referring to the Rome Agreement of January 7, 1935) to the British Foreign Office. The report concludes that, based on various circumstances, it is clear that Italy is determined to control Abyssinia by any means necessary. For the sake of the British Empire's defense, it would be more advantageous to maintain Abyssinia's independence, but since war between Britain and Italy is absolutely impossible at this time, it seems that British interests will not be immediately threatened if Abyssinia comes under Italian control. For the sake of Britain, it is essential to obtain control of the Lake Tana area, protect the interests of British nationals in Abyssinia, and take the opportunity to revise the borders between British Somaliland, Kenya, and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and Abyssinia. If this is done, even if Abyssinia is controlled by Italy, it would still be beneficial to Britain. (19th, Havas)</p>
<p>London – After the Italian newspaper, Il Giornale d'Italia, published an abstract of the British Cabinet Committee report, official sources declined to comment, merely stating that the report had not been published. Political sources said that the "facts revealed" by the Italian newspaper are of no surprising significance. (19th, Havas)</p>
<p>Rome – The British Embassy and the Italian Information Ministry are unwilling to issue statements regarding the report published by the Italian newspaper. The political significance of this matter is currently unclear. Furthermore, British Ambassador Sir Eric Drummond had just visited Prime Minister Mussolini today, and the report was published that evening. Whether this is related to Drummond's visit to the Prime Minister is also uncertain. According to our reporter's speculation, after Britain sent a memorandum to the League of Nations Council regarding the Mediterranean Mutual Assistance Pact last month, Italy immediately protested to Britain. Recently, Britain's response to Italy was cold, and Italy was quite disappointed. The purpose of Il Giornale d'Italia's publication of the report is to allow Britain and Italy to enter into new negotiations after receiving notification. It was reportedly expressed after the notification that this proposal could be approved by the United States if it were accepted by France. (19th, Havas)</p>

<p>London – The technical difficulties of the naval conference are gradually being resolved, but political issues may delay the conference. In addition to France's attitude towards battleship tonnage, according to news from Rome, the Italian representative who had returned home for instructions will return to London tomorrow with instructions from the Italian Prime Minister. Italy is unwilling to sign the naval treaty until the British fleet concentrated in the Mediterranean is withdrawn. British sources believe that Italy will not immediately raise political issues, but some are concerned that Italy will take this opportunity to resolve the Mediterranean issue. (20th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Rome – Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met today with Admiral Iachino and other naval personnel attending the London Naval Conference. He reportedly discussed issues related to the Italian Navy and the matters currently being discussed at the London Naval Conference but did not formulate a solution. According to well-informed sources, Italy is definitely not prepared to consider dismantling the two 35,000-ton battleships it is currently building and proceeding with a new program based on 27,000-ton battleships.

<h3 id="e40">Continued Discussions Between French and American Representatives on Battleship Tonnage; Draft Naval Treaty Completed <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>London – The drafting committee of the naval conference met today for two hours and completed a draft. However, difficulties with battleships and political issues may further prolong the negotiations. The French Ambassador to the United States has presented France's views to the US government, requesting that the United States reduce the number of 35,000-ton battleships, which will be handled by Norman Davis, the chief US representative attending the naval conference. This shows that the United States has consistently refused to abandon its proposal for 35,000-ton battleships. Britain wants the United States to agree to temporarily suspend the construction of large cruisers, so it has to support the United States' demand for large battleships as a reward. Therefore, the next steps will be negotiations between the British and French representatives, and what they will discuss will be the nature of the Locarno Pact regarding European airspace and the signing of a bilateral airspace agreement to safeguard national security. French Ambassador to the United Kingdom Corbin discussed everything with US Chief Representative Davis today from 4:30 PM for one hour. Corbin will meet with British Foreign Secretary Eden tomorrow. (20th, Reuters)</p>
<p>London – The French Chief Representative to the Naval Conference, Ambassador Corbin, who had previously returned home to report to the government on the situation of the conference, has now returned here. Today, he visited US Chief Representative Norman Davis, who informed him that after the French Ambassador to the United States, de Laboulaye, met with US Secretary of State Phillips yesterday, he had been instructed to continue negotiations with France on the issue of battleship tonnage. In addition, yesterday, Britain informed the US delegation in writing of the proposed draft protocol and another proposal. This draft proposes that the signatory countries authorize Britain to submit the future naval agreement to other countries, including Germany, so that they can sign up to participate, or make suggestions and consult with Britain on revisions. As for the proposal, it proposes that the future agreement allow the United Kingdom and the United States to each build several 35,000-ton battleships, but the validity period is reduced to five years.</p>
<h3 id="e41">German Signature Issue on Naval Treaty; Britain Decides to Invite Participation <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>London – Britain has decided to invite Germany to participate in the future naval agreement and co-sign it with other relevant countries. The naval conference has encountered further difficulties. Previously, in June of last year, when Britain and Germany concluded a naval agreement, it was hoped that Germany would notify Britain of future shipbuilding programs. However, after careful study of this agreement by experts, it was discovered that Germany had no obligation to notify. The British Admiralty believes that Britain must understand the characteristics of German warships before formulating a shipbuilding program, so it insists that Germany must accept this requirement and notify its shipbuilding program. Therefore, it is necessary to invite Germany to co-sign the future naval agreement. France, on the other hand, wants to resolve the issues of airspace and naval arms reduction together, and therefore raises the two issues of the interpretation of the Locarno Pact and the signing of a bilateral airspace agreement to safeguard its national security. As for Italy, its signature on the future naval agreement is conditional on the lifting of sanctions, which is still not counted. All these are difficulties encountered by the naval conference that are not easy to resolve. British naval figures believe that if the relevant countries can reach a compromise by the beginning of next month, the naval treaty can be initialed at that time, and then the UK, Belgium, France, Italy, and Germany can separately conduct political negotiations to discuss the airspace Locarno Pact. Once this pact is established, the naval treaty can be formally signed. However, during the political negotiations, Germany may request revisions to the clauses of the Locarno Pact and the current arrangements for the demilitarized zone along the Rhine, which will make the political negotiations very difficult and cannot be concluded in a short period. In the future, it may be necessary to convene a formal conference of the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact, which is not inevitable. However, Britain still hopes that the formal signing of the future naval treaty will not be later than September of this year. (19th, Havas)</p>

In practice, the policies that the United Kingdom should adopt regarding the issue of implementing oil sanctions against Italy should be discussed. The League of Nations Eighteen-Nation Committee will meet in early March to discuss this issue. At that time, Foreign Secretary Eden will be ordered to go to Geneva to represent the United Kingdom.

<p>London – Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Stanhope declared in the House of Lords today that the British government has not desired and has never considered formally amending the Charter of the League of Nations. During today's meeting, Lord Rennell suggested that the League of Nations should not only have an Executive Council in Geneva, but should at least have three councils, one for Europe, one for the Americas, and one for Asia. Stanhope then answered the above, stating that any action regarding this resolution should be based on the unanimous consent of the member states of the League of Nations. Rennell then withdrew the previous motion. Stanhope also referred to the speech by Lord Lothian, saying that the British government is paying close attention to issues such as economic nationalism and the acquisition of raw materials, but these problems cannot be satisfactorily addressed until there is progress in the overall international situation. Countries must first find a way to resolve the Italo-Abyssinian War before they can satisfactorily deal with such events. According to Lothian's statement, if countries are determined to implement the principles of the League of Nations, the League will certainly achieve great results. He also stated that the reason why countries are not actively cooperating is that they all feel that their economic security is currently threatened. (19th, Reuters)</p>

The Director of the Colonial Political Office of the National Socialist Party, Sennokel, attended and gave a speech, saying, "Today, some countries have many colonies, while a country with a population of 67 million is suffocating in a narrow territory, almost to the point of suffocation. Nothing is more contrary to the laws of nature. We have no intention of seizing the colonies of others. All we seek is the ownership of our original colonies. We must demand the return of all colonies that legally belong to our country. This is not only for economic needs, but also for the honor of Germany." (19th, Havas)</p>

<p>Tianjin – There was light snow on the 20th, and the weather is getting colder, with ice freezing and becoming more solid. (12th, Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Tianjin – The Tianjin shipping industry held a meeting at the Tianjin Shipping Company on the 20th to discuss strategies for rescuing the vessels stranded outside Dagukou. Wang Gengsan was elected to visit the Tianjin Customs Port Authority and the Hai River Engineering Bureau, hoping to concentrate the strength of icebreakers to open up the area outside Gukou to rescue the stranded ships, or continue to rent the British-owned giant icebreaker "Mara." The entire shipping industry also sent a telegram to the Ministry of Communications and forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance, instructing the Tianjin Customs and the Hai River Engineering Bureau to find ways to rescue the stranded ships. As of the evening of the 20th, there were still twenty-five ships stranded outside the port, some of which have been frozen in since January 6. Coal, water, and food have run out, and the crews are in a state of semi-starvation. The head cabin of the Yongheng ship is taking on water, and the crew is trying to block it. If it does not escape danger within a few days, it will sink. (12th, Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Tianjin – The Hai River Engineering Bureau rented the British-owned icebreaker "Mara" to break the ice, which was quite effective, but due to the high rental costs, the lease expired on the 23rd. It will be dismissed, leaving the stranded ships outside the port to face disaster. Tianjin sailors were greatly angered by this. (20th, Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Tianjin – On the morning of the 20th, Okamura, the head of the special service agency of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, along with several reporters, rented the Tianxing icebreaker to inspect the area outside the port. They will find ways to rescue the distressed ships and plan to send planes again within a few days to provide food. (20th, Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Tianjin – Shipping industry sources say that nine of the ships stranded outside the port are Chinese-owned, seven are Japanese-owned, and the rest are ships from other countries. The loss per ship per day is about 600 to 1,000 yuan. If they are cargo ships, the losses are even greater. A notice has been sent to ships coming to Tianjin from various ports, urging them to change course to Dalian and Qingdao to avoid further disaster. (20th, Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Special Feature: Biological Surveys and Research Urgently Needed in China (Continued) by Hu Xiansu</p>
<p>(X) The Investigation and Research of Insects</p>
<p>Among those competing with humans for resources, pests are the most severe. Since ancient times, locust control has been listed as a major item in agricultural policy. The damage caused by rice stem borers was also known to our ancestors. However, other pests were regarded as impossible to control, and their devastation was passively accepted. As for the relationship between insects and diseases, it was not until the modern era of scientific advancement that this was understood. Today, according to experts' estimates, the damage to agricultural products caused by insects is in the billions. Therefore, in European and American countries, no expense is spared in insect control. Whenever a pest outbreak occurs, prevention and control are treated as a major enemy. The United States even has a large-scale national Bureau of Entomology, establishing a research institute for each type of pest. In reality, the benefits of their efforts far outweigh the money spent. In our country, however, entomological research and implementation are still very rudimentary. The only large-scale insect control organization is the Zhejiang Bureau of Entomology. The Entomology Group of the Central Agricultural Experiment Station is also only roughly established. And the Jiangsu Bureau of Entomology has even been shut down, which is most regrettable for Jiangsu provincial governance. At the same time, entomological taxonomy, which is the foundation of economic entomology, is studied by very few people. For example, Lepidoptera, which includes the most harmful pests (rice stem borers belong to Lepidoptera), has no experts in China. There is only one expert in Hemiptera, and only one expert in Coleoptera. Diptera is most closely related to human health (mosquitoes and flies belong to Diptera), but today there are very few medical entomologists. And there is only one person with a broad foundation in the research of these numerous insects. Therefore, to talk about pest control today without paying attention to the study of insect taxonomy is like neglecting the foundation and focusing on the branches. The number of insect species is the most numerous among animals. And the knowledge of insects in our country is especially scarce. A certain entomologist once said that in China, perhaps nine out of ten species of Lepidoptera are new species. Therefore, pure and economic entomological research should both be given equal importance today, and researchers should accumulate knowledge in both areas.</p>
<p>(XI) Research on Parasites</p>
<p>Parasites in the human body and animal bodies are extremely harmful. For example, in several counties in Zhejiang, due to the rampant liver fluke, entire families have fled. Hookworm also causes great harm to health. Human parasites are a problem for medical researchers to study; livestock parasites should be of concern to those engaged in agriculture. There are only a few experts in China who study parasites, and this type of research should also be encouraged.</p>
<p>(XII) Research on Beneficial and Harmful Birds and Beasts</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Industry distributed a list of beneficial and harmful birds to various biological research institutions to solicit opinions for the purpose of formulating detailed rules for hunting laws. In fact, without large-scale and long-term investigation and research, it is impossible to determine which birds are beneficial and which are harmful. If such lists are printed and distributed at this time, they will inevitably become a laughing stock like the former Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce's "Guidelines for Afforestation in Various Provinces." China has a large number of bird and mammal species, but there are only three or four people in the country who have done thorough research on ornithology, and only one person who has studied mammals. From an applied perspective, the relationship between mammals and human life is particularly close and significant. For example, rodents are harmful to agricultural products and even transmit diseases, such as the plague in the Northeast and rat fever in South China. Musk deer in Sichuan, as well as fur-bearing animals that produce leather and animals that can be hunted in northern provinces, all deserve close attention. Angora rabbits will certainly be a very important economic factor in North China in the future. And the domestication of black and white foxes has already brought great profits to some people. It seems that the domestication of other domestic rare fur and leather beasts is also a matter of urgency. And these applied problems must begin with a large-scale survey of birds and mammals. The United States National Biological Survey, established for fifty years, is large in scale and has made many achievements, which our country should emulate.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned biological surveys and research undertakings that our country urgently needs to carry out are all outside the scope of formal agricultural research, but they involve myriad aspects and are waiting to be undertaken. However, the state has not made the slightest effort in this type of work, except for the Institute of Zoology and Botany of the National Academy of Sciences, which has paid attention to fisheries surveys and fungal research. Although there are six or seven biological research institutions in the country, they are all extremely small in scale, with insufficient funding, and they still need to focus on pure scientific research. They often lack the resources to address these applied problems. Some say that there are too many institutions, and the work inevitably overlaps; in fact, even ten times the current manpower and financial resources would not be enough to cope with all the current problems. Unless there is deliberate conflict, the work will never overlap. The above are all obvious applied problems of biology that urgently need to be solved. In fact, it is difficult to strongly distinguish between pure and applied research. Mr. Weng Wenhao said that science is a whole, and there is no such thing as pure or applied. Rather than talking about applied science, it is better to talk about the application of science. This is a profound and insightful statement that our leaders should repeatedly embrace.</p>
<p>Mr. Ding Wenjiang told us that our country spends approximately four million yuan on scientific research each year, which is less than the amount the United States spends on industrial research in two days. The United States Geological Survey has an annual budget of three million gold dollars. The expenses of other institutions can be inferred from this. The importance of biological research has been mentioned above, but the funding for all six or seven domestic biological research institutions is less than 250,000 yuan. It is impossible to expect great harvests with such little investment. The governments of the past did not know how to govern the country, so they cannot be blamed too much; in today's era of political renewal, for the sake of national defense and production, the government must vigorously promote biological research, either by establishing specialized research institutions or by subsidizing existing research institutions to focus more on the application of biological research. However, given the lack of talent in our country, and the fact that each research institution has its own history, it would be more effective to subsidize existing public and private institutions than to establish new ones. The United States National Museum is entrusted to the private Smithsonian Institution; the New York State College of Agriculture is affiliated with the private Cornell University; and the School of Forestry is affiliated with Syracuse University. And the British Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, evolved from a private research institution, all of which are notable examples.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even with the relatively developed state of biology in China today, the multitude of tasks requires ten times the current talent. If the provinces also promote this research at the same time, the need for competent personnel will be even greater. Cultivating talent is a matter of utmost urgency, and this is something that the government should specifically plan for. (The End)</p>

<p>A Travelogue of Life in the Desert (7): IX. Aspects of Ningxia Society by Jin Dui</p>
<p>In the park in front of the "People's Assembly Hall" in Ningxia stands a stone "Monument to the Newly Established Ningxia Province." Inscribed on the back is the title "Record of the Establishment of Ningxia Province." The inscription reads:</p>
<p>"Ningxia is the land of ancient Yongzhou. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty drove out the Xiongnu, reclaimed the land south of the Yellow River, established the Shuofang Prefecture, opened canals to cultivate fields, and educated the people, making it a major metropolis in the Northwest. During the Tang Dynasty, the Jiedushi [military governor] was established in Lingwu, and he meticulously planned and exerted his efforts without reservation. Emperor Suzong relied on this to establish the foundation for the restoration of the dynasty. In the early Song Dynasty, it was seized by Yuan Hao, who called it Xingqing Prefecture. The Yuan Dynasty changed it to Ningxia Road. The Ming Dynasty established the Ningxia Guard. The Qing Dynasty established the Ningxia Circuit and added a general to the Manchu city to maintain order. The Republic of China mostly followed the old system. In the autumn of the seventeenth year, the North and South were unified. The government, considering that Gansu was too large and broad, divided it into the three provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai to reduce the scope, facilitate governance, and develop Mongolia and Tibet. In January of the eighteenth year, the explicit order to establish Ningxia Province was promulgated, appointing Men Zhizhong, Shao Yuzhi, Li Shijun, Wei Hongfa, Ma Fushou, Bai Xueti, and Hu Tiankui as committee members, designating Men Zhizhong as chairman, Shao Yuzhi concurrently as Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Li Shijun concurrently as Director of the Department of Education, Wei Hongfa concurrently as Director of the Department of Construction, and Hu Tiankui concurrently as Director of the Department of Finance. The framework of a provincial government was established. In April, the provincial capital was suddenly lost, and order was not restored until a month later. Chairman Ji Hongchang's merits in bloody battles are still evident in people's eyes and ears. Subsequently, due to the outbreak of war in the Southeast, Chairman Men and Chairman Ji went east one after another. Commander Feng, mindful of the fact that the Northwest frontier could not be without someone to take military and political responsibility, ordered Hong Bin to lead his troops west and reluctantly assume the chairmanship. Upon arriving in Ningxia, he found himself in a time of great local difficulties. Now, after recovering from the pain, he realizes that the past has left more than one lesson for people. Considering that he has spent half his life in the military and has not studied, he fears that his knowledge is insufficient to draw water from a deep well and that he will fail. He can only maintain his respectful heart for his hometown, be pragmatic and realistic, encourage himself and others, and not change his original intention. Since Ningxia Province has been established, Chairman Men and Chairman Ji had planned to erect a monument to commemorate this, but due to the turbulent times, the project was repeatedly started and stopped. This autumn, the weather is favorable, and the year is bountiful. Although the country is not yet fully settled, the Shuofang region is still peaceful. Wei Shaowu, Director of the Department of Construction, has requested to continue building the monument in the park to complete the unfinished work and pass it on to future generations. Therefore, this record is written to commemorate this event, so that in the future, when politics and education are enlightened and the Mongolian people are assimilated, it will flourish and reach its foundation. This is the record."</p>
<p>After reading this record of the establishment of the province, written by Ma Hongbin, the former chairman of the Ningxia Provincial Government, in the nineteenth year of the Republic [1930], you should have a clear understanding of the simple historical evolution of Ningxia Province.</p>
<p>The capital of Ningxia Province shares the same name as the province. The province governs ten counties, three administrative bureaus, and the Alxa Erod and Ejina Torghut banners of Western Mongolia, combined. The capital is located in a majestic setting, surrounded by the Helan Mountains in the northwest and the Yellow River winding diagonally in the southeast. Ningxia City is situated in the middle. The Helan Mountains block the sandstorms blowing from the northwest for about fifty to sixty square miles around, making this place appear particularly scenic. Along the river is a plain, and with the Yellow River irrigation system, branch canals are abundant, facilitating irrigation. Life is self-sufficient. The ancients who established this city of Ningxia had a truly discerning vision. With a strategic position to rely on and land to cultivate, it naturally became an important military barrier and a stronghold on the frontier.</p>
<p>The people of Ningxia, blessed with unique natural advantages, are, however, quite isolated from the outside world due to the confined environment, developing a widespread lazy atmosphere and various social malpractices. "Do not discuss state affairs" is a common slogan seen on the walls of hostels, bathhouses, restaurants, and teahouses throughout the Northwest. The first time I noticed it was one morning, after arriving in Ningxia after a long journey, my hair was long and messy. I sat in a barber chair in a hairdressing salon, and from the mirror, I vaguely saw the word-painted red paper. At first, I didn't pay attention to it, thinking it was a common auspicious saying. Unexpectedly, when I occasionally glanced back, it turned out to be four large, square characters: "Do not discuss state affairs." Oh, strange! This first impression hit my eyes, and I immediately felt a bit indignant. In a democratic country undergoing political tutelage, people should be guided to view national affairs as their own responsibility, not to belittle their own responsibility, and to break the bad habit of not asking about politics. Now, they openly dare to restrict public opinion, saying that even talking about national affairs is not allowed. This kind of speech is considered reactionary. Later, after running around in the Northwest more, I realized that the "Do not discuss state affairs" slogan was as common as the red "Get Rich Soon" stickers. However, I never understood its origin. Could it really be that national affairs are none of their business?</p>
<p>Hu Hanmin Hosts Guests in Guangzhou, Reiterates Past Stances, Says Journey North Is Still Pending</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since arriving in Guangzhou, Hu Hanmin has been staying there temporarily to rest. Many representatives from various parties have visited him. In addition to meeting them separately, Hu has also taken trips on different days to visit the newly built factories in Guangdong Province. Yan Garden, where Hu is staying, is located at the eastern end of Dongshan, in a quiet location. In order to protect Hu's residence, the authorities have dispatched a squad of military police and a squad of security guards, as well as many plainclothes police and detectives, stationed in nearby watchtowers to guard it day and night. It appears that Hu has no intention of leaving Guangdong in the short term. On the 14th, to repay the welcome from all circles, Hu hosted a tea party at the Provincial People's Education Center in the afternoon to entertain representatives from various organizations, including the Xingzhonghui, the Tongmenghui, veteran comrades, various trade associations, labor unions, schools, and overseas Chinese groups, totaling over 400 people. After light refreshments, Hu rose to speak, reiterating his consistent personal views on the principles of the Party and the country, as follows:</p>
<p>"Comrades, representatives, I have been in the province for nearly twenty days. Due to the rush of affairs and the need for adequate rest, I have been unable to meet with all the veteran comrades to reminisce about the past and thank the various groups in Guangzhou for their warm welcome. I am very sorry. Today, I have specially invited you all to gather here, and I am very pleased. Since returning from Europe, I have received attention from compatriots and comrades at home and abroad, and the enthusiastic welcome I have received from all circles, and what they expect of me, can be summed up in the six words 'uphold the grand plan of national salvation.' Regarding this point, I have already briefly stated my views on the day of my arrival in the province. I believe that as a citizen of China and a member of the Chinese Kuomintang, our responsibilities to the Party and the country do not allow for any avoidance. I believe that all comrades present must also understand this meaning, encourage themselves, and always remember Dr. Sun Yat-sen's saying, 'The revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades must still strive.' By comrades, I mean all, old and young, new and old. Since we are comrades, we cannot abandon our responsibility to the Party and the country. The Three Principles of the People of our Party are the principles of national salvation, and they are the duty of every comrade. I expressed my views at the reception for the representatives of the provincial and municipal party headquarters a few days ago, deeply lamenting the lack of competition in the Party's affairs and recognizing the urgent need to reorganize them. The veteran comrades present here all have histories of twenty or thirty years or more. They have all witnessed the spirit of sacrifice and struggle of the Party's comrades in the past, and many have personally participated in it. They must have many emotions about the current state of the Party. The late Premier's advocacy was to build the country with the Party and to govern the country with the Party. If the Party members do not compete, how can the country be built, and how can it be governed? This is true in theory and in fact. In the past ten years or so, Party affairs have deteriorated. Some so-called Party members have used the Party for personal gain or relied on the Party to commit evil and do wrong. The Party has first lost its essential qualities of tension, solemnity, and the spirit of sacrifice and struggle. The Three Principles of the People have not been implemented, and the original meaning of the late Premier's founding of the Party has been lost. Therefore, we must strive to save the country on the one hand, pay attention to the current worries and difficulties of the Chinese nation, and find ways to save it. At the same time, we must unite true comrades, consolidate the Party's front line, and train new Party members to strengthen the Party's power. Only in this way can we promote the original meaning of the late Premier's founding of the Party, and the great cause of national salvation can be continued. Looking at the political parties of Russia, Italy, and Germany, whether they are left-leaning or right-leaning, their Party members are loyal to the Party and do their best for the people. This is a true reflection of them. Therefore, the progress of their Party affairs is rapid, and the people's faith in them is increasing day by day. As a result, the country is becoming more and more consolidated, and other countries do not dare to insult it. We should learn from this and be vigilant. Since I arrived in the province, I have been staying here for twenty days. I have received letters and telegrams from comrades at home and abroad, expressing their concern about my movements and asking about them. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly state my views on this matter. Although I rested for six months last year when I went abroad, my health has not yet recovered. Moreover, I am physically weak and afraid of the cold. Doctors have advised me to stay temporarily because the north is cold. Therefore, in terms of time, the journey north is still pending. The so-called upholding the grand plan is not something that can be accomplished with a declaration. To uphold the grand plan, there must be a way, and it must be asked what the so-called grand plan is. According to my observation, the so-called grand plans of China in the past few years have all been wrong. The so-called methods are also all wrong. Such things as diplomatic policies, financial policies, military policies, and various facilities in internal affairs are all enough to accelerate the division of the country, increase the suffering of the people, and aggravate the invasion of foreign troubles. The results of promoting such wrong policies in recent years have also been clearly revealed. I have revealed my policy positions in detail to the people of the country. What I can tell you today is that my policy positions remain consistent and have not changed. There is absolutely no problem with my movements, but it depends on whether the Party's principles can be promoted and whether the policy positions can be realized. The so-called personal problem has nothing to do with it. I am almost sixty years old. I have always been indifferent to fame and power. As far as the individual is concerned, I have nothing to ask of my comrades. However, for the sake of the Party and the country, I have much to ask of my comrades. As far as the individual is concerned, I have nothing to ask of the Southwest. However, for the sake of the Party and the country, I may have much to ask of the Southwest. To go further, the individual has nothing to ask of the people, but for the sake of the country, I have much to ask of the people. My only hope is to find a way to work together to save this broken China and strive for the freedom and equality of our country. This is my sincere hope, and I can reveal it to my comrades and tell it to future generations without shame. Today, the situation is critical, and what we must strive for is very urgent. We cannot abandon ourselves. Therefore, the veteran comrades present cannot shrink back because they are old. We must continue the revolutionary spirit of twenty years ago and work hard to the end. Mr. Xiao Fucheng, who is present today, is a model of the Party's veteran comrades. Mr. Xiao is over seventy years old, and after seventy, his writing, political affairs, and knowledge have made rapid progress, which is even more remarkable than when he was fifty or sixty years old. The Party's having Mr. Xiao as a veteran comrade is truly an honor for the Party and a great blessing for the country. It is something that I admire and respect. Therefore, the Party's veteran comrades must not think that they are old and should still strive for progress, work hard at the revolution, and learn from what Mr. Xiao has done to rebuild the Party's life. This is what I hope for. Today's reception is inadequate or simple, so please forgive me." (Evening of February 14)</p>
<p>Shantou: Recent News on the Kakuda Incident — Iwamura Returns to Tokyo to Report on the Case</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The case of Kakuda Susumu, a patrol officer stationed at the Japanese Consulate in Shantou, who died suddenly on February 21st, has not yet been resolved. The Guangdong Standing Committee, in order to be cautious, absolutely prohibits the Chaozhou-Shantou and Guangzhou newspapers from publishing the news, fearing that the local people will be greatly stimulated, leading to further problems. The Japanese Consulate has a police station, which is directly under the jurisdiction and command of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office, undertaking special tasks, and is not under the command or dispatch of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Consul. The sudden death of Kakuda was handled by the Third Fleet, entrusted by the Taiwan Governor-General's Office, to negotiate with our side. Commander-in-Chief of the Third Fleet, Vice Admiral Ogawa, and Chief of Staff Iwamura, etc., were ordered by the Japanese Ministry of the Navy to be responsible for South China. As soon as Kakuda died suddenly, the fleet immediately dispatched the Yubari warship to Shantou in haste, claiming full responsibility for the negotiations. Consul Hara Tadashi Ichiro took a subsidiary position. After that, Japanese warships and naval and army dignitaries passing through Shantou were like carp crossing the river. First, there were the Sanae and Utake warships, followed by the flagship Izumo, with Commander Ogawa on board, then the Akikaze and Hayakaze warships, with Commander Nishioka Shigetai on board, and later the Fuyo and Asagao warships. On the surface, each warship was on a tour, but their true intentions lay elsewhere. Our side responsible for the negotiations was the Shantou Municipal Government. Mayor Li Heyuan, regarding this case, believed that Kakuda's cause of death and the suspicious points were numerous and only agreed to give a reply after a clear investigation. All contacts were carried out in accordance with the orders of Li Hanhun of the Eastern District Commissioner's Office. Li had to report to the province one by one, which naturally caused delays. It is said that the Japanese side's requirements were thorough punishment of the murderer, compensation, and security for the safety of Japanese and Taiwanese residents in the future, and they took the opportunity to extend their reach to South China and expand their influence. However, before a clear investigation has been obtained, our side has no reason to engage in full negotiations. On the 7th of this month, Iwamura, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Third Fleet, together with Japanese Consul Hara, urged Mayor Li to handle the case and set a deadline for a reply, with a rather strong tone. Mayor Li said that the case was under investigation and only hoped that a solution could be found through mutual understanding in the spirit of friendship. Therefore, there was still no conclusion. Afterwards, Iwamura returned directly to Taiwan, then went to Tokyo to report the case to Navy Minister Osumi</p>

<p>Dongjiadu: Municipal Ferry Service to Open Soon; Measures for Assisting Existing Private Ferry Operators Announced. Since the Municipal Government ordered the Xingye Trust to prepare for the Dongjiadu cross-river ferry service, the Trust has been actively proceeding with the work. All pier and ferry construction is now complete. It is reported that the Trust has scheduled the installation of floating docks on both the Pudong and Puxi sides to begin today, with the official opening of the ferry service on March 1st. Regarding the existing private ferry operators, the Municipal Government, in order to streamline traffic while still considering the livelihood of the ferry operators, ordered the Trust at the beginning of the ferry preparation to draft assistance measures. The Trust then prepared several proposals and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval. The Municipal Government, for the sake of careful consideration, repeatedly convened relevant parties for detailed discussions and finally decided to adopt the second assistance proposal submitted by the Trust. The proposal was then submitted to the Executive Yuan, which forwarded it to the Central Political Council for approval. The Municipal Government has now ordered the Trust to proceed with the implementation in accordance with the measures approved by the Central Government. The Public Security Bureau has also posted a public notice of the assistance measures to inform the ferry operators to comply. The assistance measures contained in the Public Security Bureau's public notice are transcribed below.</p>
<p>Measures for Assisting Existing Private Ferry Operators and Boatmen at Dongjiadu, Approved by the Shanghai Municipal Government on January 16, 1936, Approved by the Central Political Council on January 29, 1936, Approved by the Executive Yuan on February 8, 1936: 1. From the date of the Municipal Ferry's opening, all existing private ferries at Dongjiadu will be completely and permanently discontinued. 2. Each discontinued private ferry operator will receive a lump-sum assistance payment of 20 yuan in national currency from the Municipal Xingye Trust Municipal Ferry Management Office. 3. In addition to the lump sum, each operator will also receive a monthly assistance payment of 20 yuan in national currency from the Municipal Xingye Trust Municipal Ferry Management Office, payable in the last ten days of each month upon presentation of a passbook and seal. 3. The above assistance payment will be limited to five full years from the date of the Municipal Ferry's opening. 4. The Trust will select and employ those of the original boatmen who are physically stronger, after they have passed a qualification test. 4. Each of the eighteen ferry operator groups will nominate one representative, who will bring a seal and jointly sign a joint guarantee at the Municipal Ferry Management Office. Those who do not arrive at the specified time will be considered to have voluntarily forfeited their claim. Each group will then be issued a passbook receipt for claiming the assistance payment, one for each group, to be exchanged for a formal passbook on the day the Municipal Ferry opens. The Shanghai Municipal Council Board Approves Reduction of Rickshaw Rental Fees. Detailed Review Leads to a Daily Reduction of Eight Cents.</p>
<p>At a regular meeting held the day before yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors, the Rickshaw Special Committee submitted a proposal to reduce the daily rental fee for publicly licensed rickshaws, as stipulated by the Municipal Council, to 77 cents of a silver dollar, effective April 1st. This includes a 7-cent fee for the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association, representing a daily reduction of 8 cents compared to the previous rate. It is reported that this proposal has been approved by the Board for implementation. According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's standing committee, this reduction in rickshaw rental fees was recommended to the Board after the Rickshaw Special Committee conducted a thorough investigation into the profits of rickshaw owners and the true situation of the rickshaw industry, and carefully considered reports from all relevant parties. In addition, the committee also obtained calculations from rickshaw owners regarding the cost of vehicle construction and repair. Before submitting the report to the Board, the committee carefully reviewed these figures and determined that they were accurate. Municipal Ferry Management Office Trials Streamlined Ferry Boat. The Boat can be Driven from Both Ends Without Turning Around, Which is Particularly Special.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the No. 17 ferry boat, newly built by the Municipal Xingye Trust Municipal Ferry Management Office, underwent a trial run at 1:00 PM yesterday. As a reporter, I have long admired the existing ferries for their exquisite and complete structure and equipment. Upon learning that this new vessel adopts a streamlined design, the latest type of ferry boat, I made a special trip to observe it and will describe the experience as follows: New Ferry Features According to Municipal Ferry officials, the principle of cross-river ferry design is not only to be fast, but also to focus on the agility and time-saving of berthing and leaving the pier. This is the only way to speak of convenience. Based on years of experience, our office is constantly seeking improvement. Therefore, we have decided that the new vessel being built will have the following five major characteristics: Both ends of the ferry are equipped with double propellers and double rudders, so it can be driven from both ends without having to turn around, which is extremely flexible. The top of the cabin adopts a streamlined structure, which can reduce wind resistance. When berthing, it will not collide with the pier if the wind is favorable, and there will be no disadvantage of being hit by the wind when leaving. The steering room is also streamlined, located on the upper level. The helmsman can observe in all directions without any obstruction, and it can also free up space to carry more passengers. In addition, passengers and goods are all on the main deck, so the journey is smooth. The goods are placed in the middle of the ferry, which is very spacious and does not hinder passengers from entering and exiting. The deck of the boat is level with the pier, so it can carry cars and other vehicles, and elderly, weak, women and children among the passengers can also get on and off safely. Full Boat Content The No. 17 ferry boat is made entirely of steel, 19.81 meters long, 5.18 meters wide, 2.13 meters high, and has a draft of 1.22 meters. It is equipped with two diesel engines, with a total horsepower of 150, and a speed of 9 knots. The main deck has seating for 120 and standing room for 130, as well as space for 40 vegetable baskets. The passenger cabins are at both ends, and the engine room is in the middle. Goods and vehicles are placed between the engine room and passenger cabins. The vessel is also equipped with a generator for night navigation. The passenger seats are all made of domestic wood, which is wide and comfortable. Trial Run Yesterday, no ceremony was held for the trial run. Only responsible personnel from the shipbuilding factory and the machinery contractor were sent to monitor the process with Municipal Ferry officials. The vessel departed from the factory at 1:00 PM and returned to the factory at 6:00 PM. The vessel was very stable during the voyage, and the results were quite satisfactory. It is reported that it will soon operate on the cross-river route between Tangqiao and Dongjiadu in early March. Another ferry, No. 18, will also be completed and put into service soon. French Concession Taxpayers Association Negotiates with Municipal Council. Requesting the Withdrawal of Firemen Stationed at the Gongming Factory.</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Gongming Light Bulb Factory on Shanzhong Road in this city is deemed by the French Concession Fire Brigade to have inadequate fire-fighting equipment and is at risk of fire. Two firemen have been specially dispatched, equipped with fire hoses, to guard the factory around the clock. The factory is required to provide expenses of 8 yuan and 40 cents per day. The factory, unable to bear the unreasonable pressure, specifically requested the industry association to forward a letter to the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association to negotiate with the French Municipal Council. It is learned that after receiving the letter, the Taxpayers Association sent someone to investigate and confirmed the facts. It has specially written to the Municipal Council to negotiate, requesting the withdrawal of the firemen stationed at the factory first. If the factory has any inadequate equipment, the factory should be ordered to add it with formal procedures to ensure safety. Dissatisfied with the "Song of Everlasting Regret" Film, "Little Lin Daiyu" Sues. The Film Depicts Scenes of Intimacy. "Little Lin Daiyu" Believes it is an Allusion.</p>
<p>The "Song of Everlasting Regret" film produced by the Xinhua Film Company depicts scenes of intimacy between a prostitute named "Little Lin Daiyu" and her patrons in a brothel. After the film was released, it greatly displeased a woman named "Little Lin Daiyu" who had previously lived as a prostitute. She believes that the company deliberately damaged her reputation and recently hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation with the First Special District Court against Zhang Shankun, the general manager of Xinhua Company, and Shi Dongshan, the director of the film, for defamation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ye Jianchao opened the court to summon and interrogate the defendants Zhang and Shi, but both defendants did not appear in court and were represented by their defense lawyers. The lawyers stated that "Little Lin Daiyu" is not a person's name, and they do not know how the plaintiff can prove that the person in the film is an allusion to her. The plaintiff's lawyer then stated that the plaintiff was known as "Little Lin Daiyu" when she was in the brothel, and almost everyone familiar with that world knew it. Since becoming a respectable woman, she has taken the surname of her husband, Chen, so she is now called Chen Yiyun, but her old friends and acquaintances still call the plaintiff "Little Lin Daiyu." Even the defense lawyer representing the defendant today knows that the plaintiff is the "Little Lin Daiyu" of the past. Therefore, "Little Lin Daiyu" requested that the "Song of Everlasting Regret" film be banned from screening first. Judge Ye did not approve the plaintiff's request but ordered the case to be adjourned to next Thursday afternoon for further hearing. Zhabei Shantytown Residents Appeal to Party and Government Due to Landlord's Forced Eviction. Representatives are Elected to Plan Response Measures. Request that the Landlord be Ordered to Postpone the Forced Eviction.</p>
<p>According to the Shiye News Agency, there are more than 200 shanties on the open space between Changan Road and Yutong Road in Zhabei, inhabited by more than 100 poor households. Recently, the landlord has been destroying houses and forcing them to evict, which has aroused public outrage. In addition to holding a meeting to elect representatives Liu Dongshan, Tang Lüshan, and more than 20 others to find ways to respond, they also jointly submitted a petition to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to seek relief and order the landlord, Gu Lanji, to postpone the forced eviction to maintain their livelihoods. The text of the petition reads: "Regarding the forced demolition of shanties, causing more than a thousand poor people to have nowhere to live instantly, we urgently request relief. We, the shantytown residents, were originally disaster victims from various places, affected by rural bankruptcy, who came to Shanghai to escape the famine. Fortunately, we obtained a piece of open space from the great landlord Gu Lanji and built simple shanties to live in. Although our daily food and salt were insufficient, we were fortunate to have shelter from the wind, rain, cold, and heat. The praises for you are ubiquitous, and while we were still praising your virtues, police officers suddenly came to our doors, ordering us to demolish our houses. We think that in this period of economic recession, empty houses are everywhere, and many landlords regard building houses as a daunting task. Moreover, when the spring is still cold and the need for shelter is still pressing, with your great compassion and well-known benevolence, you, our great landlord, would certainly not be so hasty. Moreover, the Lunar New Year has just passed, and daily food is difficult to obtain. Many unemployed people lack the skills to earn money. If you proceed hastily, there will be few among the old and weak who will not become beggars and fall into ditches. The direct and indirect impact on society will also be great. We, the residents, have been in Shanghai for many years and are all law-abiding civilians. If we are forced to return, we cannot return, and if we want to stay, we cannot stay. It is like being trapped in water and fire, as if hanging upside down. We have no choice but to appeal to your honor to consider the plight of the people, summon the landlord, discuss relief measures, and treat these shanties as a temporary shelter, or grant us the grace of continuing to reside temporarily, or grant us an extended period for relocation, so that you will not proceed hastily and plunge the people into deep water.

Yesterday, a Russian Also Used a Huge Stone to Throw at the Russian Consulate's National Emblem. The Defendant Claimed No Political Motive. Just Wanted to Vent Anger.</p>

He was arrested and prosecuted by the Second Branch of the High Court on charges of harming international relations and property damage. No judgment has been made yet. However, at 3:15 PM the day before yesterday, another Russian named Temituo Paituofu Lisisifu went to the Soviet Russian Consulate at No. 20 Huangpu Tan Road and used two huge stones, in the same way as Yierxing, to throw at the national emblem on the door, destroying it. He was seen by Chinese policeman No. 2961 of the Hongkou Patrol Room, who immediately arrested him and took him back to the patrol room. Yesterday morning, he was handed over to Qian Xunjiu, the lawyer of the patrol room of the First Special Court, who explained the situation and stated that the defendant had confessed in the patrol room that this action was to express sympathy for Yierxing. It was also found that the defendant had also thrown stones at the glass window of the Soviet Consulate on December 19, 1933, and was sentenced to 30 days of detention by your court. He had also been convicted by your court for theft and drunkenness. When the defendant was arrested, a Russian magazine was found on his person, which contained a passage recording his case in 1933. However, he claimed that there was no political motive, just venting anger. Therefore, it is requested that the case be adjourned to facilitate detailed investigation. Today, the Soviet Consulate also commissioned a lawyer to appear in court. When questioned, the defendant confessed that he had taken this action to express sympathy for Yierxing. Judge Huang Risheng reviewed the confession and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for further hearing.

He committed suicide by taking poison that night. It was not until 1:00 PM on the day of the decision that Zhang Asi, the tea boy, discovered it. Dai had already died. He immediately informed Zhang Zhiming of the relief room and reported to the French Patrol Room, which sent detectives to investigate. Several suicide notes written by the deceased with a fountain pen on a Western-style notebook were found, stating that he suffered from leukorrhea for a long time and had not been cured, which hindered his marriage and deprived him of lifelong happiness, so he committed suicide out of hatred. He asked his brother Shi Duo and his younger brother Shi Jin to take good care of their elderly mother, and to dissolve the engagement with his fiancee. He also asked Mayor Ma of Nanjing and Director Liu of the Health Department to report that the disease was delayed by the doctor at the Nan Fuyun Clinic, causing it to persist for a long time, and to order a crackdown to avoid harming other patients. The suicide notes were all written in fine print. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for an autopsy. At the same time, the suicide notes were taken back to the patrol room. Because there was no way to find the family of the deceased, the Second Special Court Prosecutor Wang was reported yesterday and arrived at the hall with a forensic clerk to verify that the deceased was Dai Shizhong.

When the tea boy brought tea, the guest washed briefly and then closed the door and went to bed. It was not until 1:00 PM yesterday that the tea boy routinely asked the guest if he would like to continue his stay. He found the door tightly closed and no one answered. Suspecting something was wrong, he immediately informed the accounting room to pry open the door. He saw the young traveler lying on the bed, barely breathing. There was an empty bottle of sleeping pills on the table, clearly a suicide by taking poison. He immediately reported to the patrol room. The patrol head sent Chinese and Western detectives to inspect the scene. A suicide note was found next to him, with the words "To Yang Huchen, elder brother, Shunde Lane, Haifang Road, British Concession, Yang Fuchen, father, No. 69 Gode Road, son Chunli's last letter" written on the envelope. There were many sentences in the letter, mainly describing how he was driven out by his father since childhood, how he fell into poverty in a foreign land, and how he made a living in other provinces until now. He also blamed his father for starting his business in special industries and being unrighteous. The words were extremely sad. After reading the letter, the detectives rushed him to the hospital for treatment. However, he had been poisoned too deeply and his life was in critical condition. Prisoners in the Second Special District Prison Cause Trouble. The Prisoners are Interrogated. All the Prisoners Deny Committing Violence. The Hearing Will Continue This Afternoon.</p>
<p>At 7:30 AM on the 18th of this month, Xu Changyu, 25 years old (sentenced to 13 years of imprisonment for a joint murder case, still within the extended period), and Zhu Tianming (sentenced to 8 years of imprisonment for a theft case), two prisoners on the fourth floor of the Shanghai Second Special District Prison on Masnan Road in the French Concession, incited the other prisoners to riot after refusing to be searched. They took down the iron hook on the prison door and led the crowd to commit violence, destroying wooden benches, toilets, and other items in the prison. The head of the guards reported the situation to the French General Patrol Room, and the entire team of detectives went to arrest Xu Changyu, Zhu Tianming, Zhou Genzhi (sentenced to 9 years of imprisonment for a robbery case), Wang Zilin (sentenced to 4 years and 6 months of imprisonment for a theft case), Xiang Sheng (sentenced to 8 months of imprisonment for a robbery case), Xie Agen (sentenced to 9 months of imprisonment for a theft case), Xie Laosan (sentenced to 9 years of imprisonment for a theft case), Xu Ruiyuan (sentenced to 6 months of imprisonment for a theft case), Jin Xu (sentenced to 5 years and 2 months of imprisonment for a theft case), Jiang Yulong (sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment for a joint murder case), and ten other people, along with the weapons, and took them to the patrol room. After Western detectives questioned the situation in detail and recorded their statements, they were sent to the Criminal Court 1 of the Second Special Court yesterday afternoon. First, Gu Shouxi, the lawyer of the patrol room, stated the case and said that the patrol room was prosecuting the defendants for publicly gathering to commit violence and coercion under Article 150 of the Criminal Law and obstructing order under Article 304. Then, Lu Yunxian, the guard, stated that he was on duty on the third floor that morning, and the prisoners on the fourth floor came down for exercise. He then saw the defendants Zhu Tianming and Xu Changyu taking the lead, first rushing to the miscellaneous room, but fortunately each room had already been closed. So, they rushed to the third floor and fought with the prisoners on the third floor. Later, seeing the situation was fierce, he reported the case and arrested them. According to Zhang Zhaohua, the guard, they committed violence that morning. He went forward to stop them, but was injured in the left hand by Zhu Tianming. When questioned, Zhu Tianming confessed that the prisoners must take a bath once every Saturday, but they still took a bath as usual last Saturday, the 15th. Because the bath water was too cold, they asked the old prisoner No. 598 for hot water, but he not only did not give them hot water, but also fully opened the cold water faucet and attacked them, so they were beaten. After coming down for exercise on the 18th, they returned to the fourth floor and passed the third floor. The prisoners on the third floor attacked them with bowls and other items. Because prisoners No. 103, 601, and 20 on the third floor had grudges with them, they did not dare to commit violence. When questioning the other prisoners, they all denied committing violence. At this point, it was already 7:00 PM. The judge ordered them to be remanded in custody and scheduled to continue the hearing this afternoon.

<p>Tang Liqing, the principal of the elementary school attached to the former Shaoxing Seven Counties Association on Ai'erjin Road, had a physical relationship with Shen Yunwen, a female teacher at the school, last winter. His wife, Tang Hu, discovered this and filed a complaint with the Procuratorate of the local court for adultery. After the prosecutor summoned and interrogated the case and clarified the facts, he filed a public prosecution against Tang Liqing, Shen Yunwen, and others for the crime of disrupting marriage. Judge Chen heard the case publicly but has not yet concluded it. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that Tang Hu hired a lawyer and filed a petition with the civil court of the local court for cohabitation and alimony, hoping to reconcile with her husband, because her husband Tang Liqing should not abandon his wife and fall in love with someone else. The petition states that she was formally married to the defendant Tang Liqing in May 1933 through a matchmaker. At the beginning of the marriage, the relationship was quite good. But last year, the defendant suddenly changed his behavior and fell in love with someone else, abandoning her. As a woman, a foreigner in a foreign land, and having given birth to a son who is only ten months old, she has been pawning items to make a living. Recently, her life has fallen into despair, and she has no choice but to seek legal relief, requesting that the defendant be ordered to pay a lump-sum alimony of 5,000 yuan. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Zhang Shao arrived at the 14th court to summon the parties. Only the plaintiff Tang Hu and her lawyer appeared in court, stating the previous situation and requesting a judgment in accordance with the law. The interrogator obtained the statement and stated that this case belongs to personal litigation and both parties must appear in court in person. Today, the defendant Tang Liqing did not arrive. The plaintiff is ordered to invite relatives and friends to conduct a reconciliation with the defendant. If he does not comply, then the case will be re-heard and a decision will be made.

Siming Bank Believes Private Transactions Were Involved. Sues for the Invalidation of the Agreement Against Cheng Linsheng and Others.</p>
<p>Due to the economic downturn, the property market downturn and the failures of various businesses, the real estate tycoon Cheng Linsheng fell into a state of financial difficulty, resulting in a series of lawsuits. Now, Siming Bank has brought a lawsuit against Cheng Linsheng in the First Special Court due to the Gentai Hefe Factory debt incident. The facts are that Cheng Linsheng and Cheng Yize jointly founded the Gentai Hefe Factory, with Li Quanshen serving as the manager. They had a long-term overdraft relationship with Siming Bank. As of December last year, they owed Siming Bank 74,897.18 yuan. Last autumn, the Gentai Factory suddenly leased the factory to Hu Xiannan and added the characters "Yi Ji" to the factory name, without publishing this lease fact in the newspapers. Siming Bank believes that this was a private transaction, intended to deceive others and resist third parties, which seriously hindered their debt collection. They sent a letter requesting the public disclosure of the lease agreement, but to no avail. Only Hu Xiannan came forward to mediate, but he gave evasive answers regarding the contents of the agreement. In addition to separately suing for the owed funds, Siming Bank filed a lawsuit to invalidate the lease agreement in accordance with Article 244 of the Civil Code and Article 247 of the Civil Procedure Code, requesting a judgment to invalidate the falsely concluded lease agreement and to remove the characters "Yi Ji" added to the factory name. The defendants listed are Cheng Linsheng, Cheng Yize, Li Quanshen, and Hu Xiannan of the Gentai Factory. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Cao Jun opened the 12th Civil Court to summon the parties. Cheng Linsheng was represented by lawyer Tang Wushi, Cheng Yize was represented by lawyer Chen Zhen, and Hu Xiannan was represented by lawyer Li Lin. Lawyer Tang argued that Cheng Linsheng's wealth has been fading due to business failures. The Gentai Factory was actually leased in March last year. Because the factory's movable and immovable property were seized by creditors, it was unable to continue operating. Considering the livelihood of the workers, they had no choice but to lease it out. The lease agreement did not hinder the rights of creditors, so the plaintiff's request cannot be established. Lawyer Chen and Li Quanshen denied being partners of the Gentai Factory. Lawyer Li stated that Hu Xiannan leased the factory in good faith, and there was no collusion as claimed by the plaintiff. After reviewing the case, Judge Cao ruled that further investigation was needed and adjourned the hearing. Twenty-Four Packages of Morphine Hidden in Tin Cans. Yuan Qifu Sentenced to Six Years.</p>
<p>Chen Jinsheng, a Chinese detective of the Jiaxing Road Patrol Room, saw Yuan Qifu, a Tongzhou native, holding two tin cans near Zhaofeng Road and East Broadway at 10:30 AM the day before yesterday. Suspecting him, he arrested him and found 24 small packages of the drug morphine in the cans. After questioning, he learned that Yuan lived at No. 29 Dongyouheng Road. He went to search the back building of his house, and Xu Da, a fellow villager, suddenly threw a morphine injection out of the window into the alley. Detective Chen arrested Xu and took him and Yuan, along with the injection, to the patrol room for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court 3 of the First Special Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer of the Municipal Council, explained the previous situation and asked for punishment. Then, Detective Chen reported the process of solving the case and presented the evidence. When questioning Yuan Qifu, he confessed that the morphine was given to him by a friend surnamed Song on Gongping Road to be carried to Yuanchang Lane in Hongkou on his behalf and was not his own. He said that Xu Da was not involved and gave evasive answers. When questioned, Xu Da firmly stated that the injection was not his either and asked for a judgment. Judge Xiao Xie ruled that Yuan Qifu be sentenced to six years of imprisonment and Xu Da be released without charge. He reprimanded Xu once, and the evidence was confiscated.
