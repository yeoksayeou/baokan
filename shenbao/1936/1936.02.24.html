<h3 id="c11">中國對外貿易之新姿態 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— 梓</p>
<p>上月底海關發表去年十二月份出超五百餘萬元之消息昨日各報又登載本年一月份出超一百三十餘萬元之新聞此由積年處於入超地位之中國言之無論共原因所在爲新貨幣政策影響之好的現象或爲表示國民購買力薄弱之壤的現象要不失爲可以注意之事態査我國自有海關出入口貿易統計以來除同治三年（一八六四）獲見一决出超二百七十餘關兩之紀錄外其餘各年以關兩爲單位之入超數多至五萬萬五千六百餘萬（民二十一）少亦達一千六百餘萬（民八）是項入超在中國之國際收支計算中極占重耍地位換言之卽係中國之一大漏巵爲硏究中國經濟問題之人士所焦慮而無術挽回者也今者出超報吿連見兩决其數雖少惟自造成中外貿易之新姿態方面言關係却頗重要茲就事實一推究之</p>
<p>第一中國入超之趨勢以自十七年至二十一年之五年間增加最劇二十二年卽改趨减勢計二十二年較上年减一萬萬三千餘萬元二十三年又自上年之七萬萬元减至的五萬萬元之數去年又减至三萬萬四千餘萬元依此觀察則本年嗣後數月縱令出超報吿不能常見入超之數亦必較以前大减此觀之過去三年間之趨勢而可知者</p>
<p>第二在上述趨勢中有一可注意之事卽入超之逐年减少與貿易總額之减少成一正比例說者多謂貿易總額數字之所以低下其一部份原因爲輸出入物品貨價之降落另一部份原因爲貿易之衰落觀於一月份出口之爲三千七百萬餘元與入口之爲三千五百萬餘元各不及貿易旺盛時每月入超水準四千萬元之數則國人之應憂應喜尙難决於今日也</p>
<p>第三兩個月出超現象中其輸出品首位均爲桐油夫中國出口貨向以大豆絲茶蛋品棉類皮貨綢緞爲重要桐油在二十二十一兩年尙未能列入前十位二十二年始突列第五中國出口貿易中新增此一物固屬可喜然同時絲茶等出口之减少亦可殷憂此亦應加以注意者</p>
<p>據上述三端觀察中國對外貿易在此新貨幣政策施行中自有可以振發之希望惟如何使重要國產大量出口以供世界之需求以裨益民生則尙待於努力否則此出超新姿態之成立實可喜而未可喜也</p>
<h3 id="c12">對法俄互援公約　德國應付三步驟　靜觀巴黎動向再定行止　武力佔萊茵倫早有準備 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>

<p>— Lonis　Fisher作　賓符譯</p>
<p>昨天我從積雪的阿爾卑斯山到了氣候溫和的倫巴底。今天在街上踱了好多時候。每家店舖都用綠白紅的國徽顏色揭示着「本店只賣意貨」的招紙。還有一種則是勸人民只買意貨或非制裁國的產品。有一家藥房通吿着「愛國的意人只買意藥。」還有一家咖啡店警吿喝酒者「只喝意國酒。」那標語也有是從墨沙里尼的言辭中摘了片段的。如果制裁嚴厲地實施下去，這種愛國心的自願行動恐也將無止境。這種反制裁的宣傳，就爲的鼓動人民對於外國的深刻仇視，而使集中於法西斯蒂集團之下。</p>
<p>關於東非，阿此西尼亞以及黑人種族的書籍，在書店中堆滿着。在每家書店的橱窗中，特別陳列着的是卡熱萬里所著「不列顚在非洲的征服」一書，因爲意大利人常一再反駁着：「英國自己已在非洲掠奪了這許多，她可有什麽權利干涉我們征阿呢？」當然無權干涉的；但是道德在帝國主義政策中本來是不重要的啊。</p>
<p>一家文具店橱窗的玻璃板上佈滿着郵片和畫片。有一張待售的畫片畫着一個穿熱帶制服的意國軍官。他面對了一羣阿此西尼亞的酋長，有的朝他跪着，有的直立着向他行羅馬式的敬禮。這下面用括弧註着「敵人」兩字。他的後面，有一隻手拿了柄長劍正想對他背部斬去，長劍上註着「制裁」字樣。這下面也有一行括弧的小註：「我們的友人」。我又在許多地方看到一張郵片，畫着的是一個武裝的意兵踐踏在阿此西尼亞地圖的上面。他手裏拿的是一把火炬，燃燒成綠，白，紅三色。在這有色的火燄上，寫着一個意國字Civilita（文化）。</p>
<p>「給祖國以金和鐵」。在某條街上我看到有輛運貨汽車停在一家咖啡茶葉店的門首。羣衆圍視着，一個穿褐衫的拿了許多空咖啡罐向車上塞，車廂裏面已是堆滿爛鐵和碎錫了。有一本在報攤出售的雜誌，上面印着一張卡通盡，表示一艘載了黃金的船卽將離開口岸。這就是「黃金從法國的逃避」。這盡的後面則畫着意大利人都把耳環，戒指，金錶以及類似的東西丟到熔爐中去的情形，這就是「意大利所收受的黃金禮物」。</p>
<p>墨沙里尼的照片是到處可以看到的——墨沙里尼在發怒，皺眉，撅嘴，微笑，墨沙里尼在拔劍，開槍，游泳，踱步演說，奏琴；墨沙里尼在大砲上，在坦克車上，在馬上，在平台上；墨沙里尼是樸素的，帶着羅馬的冠，鋼的盔，法西斯的便帽；墨沙里尼，墨沙里尼。他有着一種戲劇的意味，意大利人是歡喜這些的。他的兩眼閃耀着一種偏執在的兇燄。那沉食突出的下頷顯示着力和意志；那蹙縮的嘴唇則吿訴着一種驚世的雄心。</p>
<p>有時我踱到米蘭比較貧苦的區域，我就不禁想到了我的幼年。因爲我在這裏所嗅到的氣味，正同我生長的斐爾台爾斐亞南部意大利區域中的氣味一樣。我回想着，我的意大利的遊伴都是膽大，喧鬧而勇敢的。我們年靑的「一羣」常常推動載煤的火車，大家互相以煤塊投擲着。但意大利孩子可並不是最好的戰士。</p>
<p>在米蘭比較冷僻的地方，我看到幾張米蘭省政府的舊布吿，大意說「爲贊助中央當局的盛舉」，特設現金獎額三百名，每名計五百里爾，（Lire意幣名）給那能在一九三一年十月二十八日至一九三六年十月二十八日期間育兒三人的母親。這通吿上說，優先權是讓給較貧苦的家庭的。我斷言沒有人會要參加這種競爭的。五年內得生三個孩子！法西斯蒂黨人不過想借此藉口說因人口過剩，使阿比西尼亞對他們成爲必要。他們自己一面又竭力誇張人口過剩的問題。日報每天刋着官方發表的統計。據今天晚報所載，上月米蘭生育人數爲一·一九七；死亡九六七；結婚六二七。意大利一種宣傳刋物曾經說，「法西斯蒂統治下婦女的地位，實際上就是家庭的中心」。但她「必須是盡過神聖的任務的，……必須是做了母親的」——特別是她能獎勵兒子去當兵。</p>
<p>今天是星期，我跑到華麗的大理石的禮拜堂去。這裏有着兩千座大理石的雕像，有的位於很高的光塔上；這裏有着雕花的坡璃窗；這裏有着美麗莊嚴的儀式和歌唱。在外面廣塲上，黑衫的樂隊演奏着愛國的讚美詩。人羣中有一二個人在稱許每一節的韻調。</p>
<p>我踱進一處寳貴的陳列所。巨大的壁上懸掛着一幅透明物質製成的阿比西尼亞地圖。牠的後面，在阿迭斯，阿巴巴到蘇丹邊境的空間，嵌着墨沙里尼戴鋼盔的頭，忽明忽暗地閃爍着。相近處有一只機械的蜜蜂很有規則地在向一朶花吮吸。</p>
<p>在大道，邊街以及一切建築物的墻頭上，每個空隙都貼滿着標語。「墨索里尼」「Duce萬歲」，「阿杜瓦征服者萬歲，」法西斯革命萬歲，東非光榮的勝利的軍隊萬歲，我皇萬歲，這也萬歲，那也萬歲。到處又是墨沙里尼戴了鋼盔的頭的棕色招貼。我注意到有許多的標語都遭撕被了。有的被指頭撕去了一角或一條。有的被利器在中央截了洞。這却使我很感興味。我走了一條街又一條街。中心的街上有許多標語只被撕碎冷僻的街上有些標語則簡直被全部撕去了。我看看廣吿的招貼，却很少被撕毀，大部仍是完整的。我雇了車到郊外，然後緩步踱歸。如果這標語撕毀的現象是有政治意義的話，我可斷定我的觀察了。這是毫無疑義的：除了很少數的外，那法西斯標語都是出於有計畫破壞者之手撕毀者。米蘭郊外的標語比城中少，但偶然也有幾張是給撕去了。</p>

<p>— 中央大學地理系主任　（黃國璋）</p>
<p>無論初中或高中，外國地理都是一門必讀的功課，我想，各位心中都不免懷了這麼一個疑問，就是我們究竟爲什麼要學外國地理呢？關於這個問題的答案，當然各人不同，但據我個人的意思，我們所以要學外國地理，實在有三個最大的原故：</p>
<p>第一，可以明瞭國際間的相互關係。</p>
<p>第二，可以明瞭中國在國際間所處的地位</p>
<p>第三，可爲改進國計民生的借鏡。</p>
<p>講到第一點，就是學外國地理可以明瞭國際間的相互關係。我現在先講國際關係中幾個基本要素及其與地理的關係，然後再舉幾個實例，說明一國的對外關係都是有牠特殊的地理背景的。</p>
<p>現在世界好像一個有機體，各個部分都有一積互相牽連的作用，沒有那一個部分不受外部的影響，也沒有那一個部分不可以影響外部，所謂牽一髮而動全身，正足以表示現在國際關係的深切。立國於現在的世界上面，不但掌握政權的人對於國際間相互牽連的關係，以及國際間重大的問題，要有深切的認識，就是一般國民對於國際問的情形，也應該有一個初步的了解，以便作爲國家對外交涉的後盾，要是這樣，所謂國民外交才有實現的一日。</p>
<p>現在國際間的情形是到了極嚴重而極複雜的時候，許多國家感着政治問題的不易解决；許多國家感着社會的不能安定；最大冬數的國家鬧着經濟的恐慌，不可終日；還有許多國家爲　國際資本帝國主義侵略，處於水深火然之中，無論在政治。經濟。社會各個方面都找不到出路。各國的利害關係，及各國所感受的嚴重問題，各不相同，因此使得國際間相互的關係史加錯綜複雜。</p>
<p>國際間相互的關係，雖然銷綜複雜，但是這種錯粽複雜的國際關係之所以形成，却有牠最基本的五個要素。我們要想對於道種錯綜複雜的國際關係有一個相當的認識，非得由這五個組成國際關係的基本要素入手不可。現在很簡單的逐一加以說明：</p>
<p>土地與天然富源的專有——全地球面上除了南極洲新發現的地方以外，差不多沒有什麼地方不是有國家管理，並且最大多數的土地與天然富源，還是屬於私人所有。假使一個國家欲想擴大自己的領土，或添加自己的天然富源，除了侵犯其他國家所有的土地及天然常源外，簡直沒有其他的機會；原來不很相關的地方，爲了這個原故，也發生連帶的關係來了。</p>
<p>人口增加的迅速及分佈的不均勻——在十八世紀以前，全世界僅有四萬萬到五萬萬人，的與中國現在的人口數目相當。據最近的統計，全世界人口總數已達二十萬萬左右。在三兩百年短期間以內，所增加的人口數目，竟超過了自古有人類以來，所增加人口數目的四倍或五倍，眞是人數進展史上一大奇跡；最近數百年來，人口增加所以這樣迅速，是由於近代科學的發達，一方面增加人類生產的能力，一方面增長人類的平均壽命。可是人口的增加是沒有止境，而世界陸地的面積和天然富源去有窮盡，生產力的增加也有一定的限度，因此世界主要的國家幾乎普遍鬧着人口過剩的恐慌，於是亟亟想圖人口比較稀少地方的佔領，以作向外移民的打算，就是用强力去奪取弱國的天當以謀木國人口生活資料之增加，爲此所引起的國際紛爭，眞是不知有多少。</p>
<p>世界人口不但增加得很快，而且分佈也很不均勻，許多地方每方英里不到二人，許多地方每方英里在一千人以上；像東南亞洲，西北歐洲，美國的東北部分，都是世界人口極稠密的地方，平均每方英里都在二百人以上：在這些地方，人類的生存競爭表演得十分劇烈。有的每年全靠風調雨順，五穀豐登才可以勉强度日，有的全靠天下太平，沒有戰爭，原料品和製造品到處可以轉運流通，才可以勉强過活；如果風雨失調，收成不好，或是國際貿易，因故衰落，許多人就會感着飢寒交迫的危險，整個的世界都將爲之感着不安。</p>
<p>天然富源分佈不均——天然富源中的鑛產乃是近代新式工業的基礎，但鑛產的分佈，世界各國很不均勻，如發展重工業所需要的煤，五分之四出產在美·德·英三國；所需要的鐵，四分之三出產在美·法·英三國；他如石油十分之九以上出在美國·墨西哥·與俄國；四分之三的銅，產在美國·智利·日本；四分之三的金，出在南非洲·美國·加拿大三處。此外其他的鑛產也是一樣集中在少數國家。鑛物產量所以分佈不勻，而各國利用自然能力的高低及出產費用的多少當然很有關係，但最大的原因，還是由於鑛藏本身分佈的不均勻，有的地方多，有的地方少，而且鑛藏是天然迭成，非人的力量所能改變，少就少，多就多，人是莫可如何的；鑛產又是過去多少年代所造成的天富，用了一噸就它了一噸，要想補救是絕不可側的事。但是各種鑛產的需用並不限於一國一地，同時一國一地所出產的鑛物不見得一國一地所側消用得完，在這種情形之下，唯一的辦法是各地互相補助，以自己多餘的運銷他處，不够的由他處運來，這樣世界各國相互依賴的關係更深，國際問題也更來得複雜了。這是專就鑛產來講，他如農產品製造物呂等也都受到地方的限制，都需要各個區域間的合作，換句話說，都可以促進國際關係的密切。</p>
<p>交通工具的改良——近代科學的進步，使得人類的交通方法一天一天的巧妙，使得地而上的距離一天一天的縮短。從前的人望洋興嘆，現在可以汽輪環遊世界；鐵道。汽車道可以爬山過嶺飛機飛艇更可以凌駕高空；而陸上電綫，海底電綫密佈地球面上，無綫電更可以利用空中的以太使各地互通消息，所謂天涯若比隣，由今日講來，實在不是過分的說法。世界各處無論思想，或貨物的交換，都是十分的方便，國際間的關係，爲之更加密切。</p>
<p>爲了交通工具的改良和運輸的便利，我們日常生活所需要的資料來源更加擴大，國際貿易的發展有一日千里之勢，試想我們家裏所吃。所穿。所用的東西，自外國運來的眞是不知有多少。中國號稱以農立國，但糧食不足以自給，每年要由安南·暹羅等地運進大量的米；衣料也感不够，須由印度運進大量的棉花，由日本運進大量的棉布，建築工程上所需要的鋼鐵機械及公路上所需要的汽油。車輛，大多數也由外國運來。至於日常的用具由外國輸入的更是不勝枚舉，假使印度棉花歉收，上海和大坂的花價就會上漲，棉紗，棉布就要加價，我們的衣料也就會貴起來了，假使安南·暹邏發生意外的水旱災害，上海的米價就會上漲。宜是專就中國而言，其他各國的情形更是過無不及，爲着國際貿易的關係，全世界可說已成爲一個整個的經濟單元了。</p>
<p>產業革命的影響——自從十八世紀末葉英國最先舉起產業革命的旗幟以後，世界各國先後受其影響，利用機械的力量及地下的煤鐵促進人類工業生活的發展，從事大量的生產，想從工業上找一條人類生存的新出路。產業革命最大的結果，一方面是製迭物品的大量增加，一方面是原料及燃料消耗量的大量增加。大量的製造品非一國一地所能消用，大量的原料及燃料也非一國一地所能供給，勢非向別的地方尋找製造品的市場及原料燃料的供給地不可，帝國主義從此抬頭，國際貿易從此發展，而國際間的相互關係，也從此更見得複雜了。</p>
<p>以上所講的乃是組成目前這種錯綜複雜國際關係的五個基本要素，欲想對於國際關係有一個相當了解，是非得由這些基本要素入手不可。但想對於這些基本要素有一個相當的了解，首先須得具有相當的外國地理知識，你想所謂世界人口的分佈及人民的生活狀况，天然富源的分佈，交通路綫的分佈，以及各地物品交易的情形等等，那一種不是地理的學問？所以凡是一個國際問題的發生，莫不有他深長的地理背景，地理知識可說是解答國際問題的鎖錀，這就是我們要學外國地理的第一個目的。　（未完）</p>

<p>— 金兌</p>
<p>十二，寗夏的雲亭渠與移墾辦法</p>
<p>寗夏水利，是金中國最負盛名的，渠脈紛流，誌如前文，但是，在寗夏和靈武境內，就原有渠道，仍有鑾灌不到水的田地，尤其，寗夏縣附近黄河西岸，曠原平闊，遍望膏　，然而居民稀疏，村落寥寥，饒富的沃源，竟成蕪廢的荒野，為救濟前者灌溉上的困難，並使後者的荒地興發，在寗靈兩縣間，省當周就有要擇地闢建一條渠道的計劃和必需了，</p>
<p>這計劃中的渠道工程，果然實行起來了，因為全是用兵工擔任修濬的，所以工費都很輕省，二十三年冬至去年春天，繼續着進行，受天氣的影響，或作或輟，終于在二十四年五月十一日，雲亭渠舉行開水典禮了，</p>
<p>這渠道連築堤壩和沿途橋樑，撥欵十二萬餘元，渠長約一百二十餘里，灌溉區域，約六十萬畝，為紀念敌前主席馬福群（字雲亭）将軍，所以命名「雲亭渠」的，</p>
<p>渠道雖然完成，但在灌溉區域的田地，荒置尙多，如不設法開墾，撸狼?修濬，是沒多大利盆的，所以在渠道完成以终，還得有一段移墾計劃，據說建渠經費十二萬餘元，尙有七八萬元的賸欵，省當局就利用渠工上賸下的那筆欵，加上淸丈地畝時所收的註册費，共總約二十萬元的數目，打算撥做移墾的經費，計劃先移民四五百戶，成立三個新村，從事墾殖渠道兩旁荒地，至所移民的籍貫，本省外省，都沒不可，將來墾務發展，從事地方建設，憑空添多了五六十萬畝田地，增加了許多人民，撸佬?益的果實，纔豐赖目捎^，</p>
<p>在寗夏省致府二十四年发行政計劃，關於建設方面的墾殖項下，列有「雲亭渠區域屯墾辦法，」</p>
<p>「寗夏新建雲亭渠開闢以後，可灌數十萬畝地，擬設立雲亭渠區域屯墾籌備處，實施兵民屯墾，其辦法如下，（甲）由屯墾籌備處以第十五路軍總指揮部參謀處及副官長，墾殖專門人員一員，建設廳科長一員，屯墾部隊之長官一員組織之，其應辦事務如左，　測繪屯墾地區，考騐墾區地質，　設計及建築墾區之住宅，塞堡，堤壩，橋樑道路及疏鑿溝渠，　實施削平地段與割分區域，　分配住宅耕種畝數，農具，牲口，重籽，肥料等，　辦理移民事宜，（乙）測量數萬畝地，作一團人之屯墾區，一團官兵有五百人，每人二十畝地，合計三萬畝地，此外造房修渠闢路，統計三萬五十畝，一團所屬特務連重砲連三營，一營四連，卽為四個單位，一連九班，一班十人至十二人，以一班人種二百畝地，一連種二千畝地，四連種八千畝地，分配四角，中間是營，再中間是團，完全為軍隊組織，大者以團為基本，小者以班為基本，一班人住一堡寨，將軍隊組織運用到行政組織上，軍民打成一片，實行保甲制度，一班種二百畝地，等於人民一甲所種之地，九班等於一惫┈四保等於一聯合惫┈四聯合保等於一區，就如四營等於一團，可以住一千五百戶人，一切應用物品，房屋，均由軍隊代作，至車輛牲畜，由公家購買，將來以所出產物品，給公家償還，至生產分配方法，為公兵生產公共分配，為二百畝地，一百畝種稻，一百畝種麥，麥稻收穫後，在公共倉庫者合存，除每家食用外，借公家用具，分年還淸，所盈餘者按勤苦懶惰，作為分配多寡，一切荒地，俟由軍隊墾熟，然後交給人民去作，」</p>
<p>下面一項是「招募移民辦法」。續錄於左，「寗夏居黄河之上游，當西北之要衝，土地肥美，水利稱便，徒以人口稀少，徧地荒凉，邊區旣感空虛，地利尤嫌未盡，而東南各省，地狭人稠，無田耕種，求供頓失調劑，食糧輒起恐慌，茲為調劑人口增加生產開發地利計，特指定雲亭渠，河忠堡，鎭溯堡，李崗堡，自馬灘，廣武，姚伏堡等地為移墾區，規定優待墾民辦法，共內涵如左，</p>
<p>（甲）　移民手續，　凡願移民本省者，無論共為個人或法人，均應向其該管省或縣政府，領取執照，以資證明，並由發證機關，先將戶口男女人數起行日期經過路綫，通知本省墾殖總局，以便籌備，　選擇墾民不論難民災民，或自願移墾之農琵，均以品行良善勤苦耐勞者為合格，其携帶眷屬舉家前來者，尤為適宜，</p>
<p>（乙）　招待辦法，本省邊境之來往要道，設置墾民招待處，墾民進入本省境界後，應持所携帶之證明書或執照，前往報到，以便招待，暫設招待處之地址，為磴口縣之廣興源，中寗縣之資安堡，鹽池縣之惠安堡，</p>
<p>（丙）　安揷辦法，本府於指定各屯墾區，設置墾殖分局，選擇適宜地點，建設新村若干處，由村公所審查墾民之職業，分配住址，按墾民之壯了數目給以荒地，每一成年男子授田二十畝，老幼及婦女以半數授給，」</p>
<p>「墾殖總局招來墾民啟事，」亦是足資關心西北實况和開發研究的參考，一併附鈔，以白國人，原文如左，</p>
<p>「本省地處黄河上游，渠道縱横，土質膏腴，水利獨擅，而且無旱無澇，年種年收，農產豐盈，稻麥咸宜，天下黄河富寗夏之諺，洵非虛語，現在匪徒絕跡，治安無虞，交通便利，閭閻繁榮，只以地曠人稀。荒蕪徧野，利棄於地，良深可惜，當茲强鄰環伺，邊防函待業固，農民流離，人口尤須調融，為增加生產面積，發展國家產業，解决人口，鞏固國防諸問題，曾經呈准中央，劃本省為墾殖試騐區域，更責成本局積極舉辦，除招徠墾民辦法外，茲转摘錄要點，列舉於次，凡我農民同胞，　興乎來，勿失良機，此啟，</p>
<p>凡屬中華民國國籍之農民，其携眷前來，持有當地政府之證明書件者，均所歡迎，惟政府及企業家舉辦之移民團體，其辦法商酌擬定，</p>

<h3 id="c73">浙省擬施行　墨魚漁業取締辦法 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>定海通訉、墨魚　捕網捕之争、為江浙兩省漁業糾紛之重要問題、浙建　為圖澈底解决起見、曾　成該省水產試騐塲硏究　網捕之利害及墨魚之人工　　、該塲已擬訂禁漁期及取締辦法、呈請採擇施　、茲探得其辦法及說明書如下、（墨魚禁漁期及取締刮晒漁籠等項原理與辦法說明書）</p>
<p>「查墨魚產卵旺盛時期、係在五月十五至十六日間、在此時間之前後、雖有墨魚來游近海而行生殖、然為數極少、不關重要、墨魚孵化情形、經研究桔果、知凡在五月內或六月初新產之卵、因水溫尙低、（約攝氏十七愛至二十度間）需要三十天以上始能孵化、六月初旬以後所產之卵、以水溫较高（約攝氏十九度至二十二度）所需孵化時間、則為二十六天至三十天之譜、由此可見墨卵之孵化、在六月十六日以後至七月二十日間為最多、此期亦可稱為魚卵孵化之主要時期、且魚籠所附着之魚卵、最容易被鎭動說落、或受籠與船舷相擦所生之殘害、而使魚卵得以自然孵化、是以規定禁魚期後、籠捕不特無害、而且能扶助墨魚之蕃殖也、</p>
<p>據本塲二十四年之試騐及調查、發見墨魚卵之孵化、均以六月下旬至七月中旬為最盛、如規定禁漁期為每年六月二十目至七月二十日、墨魚方面、固可得大量繁殖之機會、而魚婪矫妫?無多大妨碍、藍此時已近来汎、漁罃佟⒍~體因生殖之後、消瘦孱弱、品質亦劣、雖禁止撈捕、亦不致影響渔民生計也、</p>
<p>又查籠捕及其他漁撈作業、對於魚卵及幼魚之處置、有危害墨魚之蕃殖而宜加以取締者、厥有四端、　樸籠、漁民嫌魚籠附有魚卵過多、每於角籠取起後、先將墨魚取出、乃以捧在籠之外部撲擊、使魚卵脫落、下沉海中、此種處置、足以使魚卵無發育機會、實有取締之必要　晒籠、漁期中固魚籠附著魚卵過多、有碍撈捕之功效、漁艮筷將籠携至陸上、曝晒於烈日中、使魚卵乾死搖落、復携回漁場應用、此種舉動、漁民雖可得一時之利便、但於墨魚之蕃殖、為害至大、亦應取締者也、　燒籠、漁汎後、竹籠因魚卵附着沉重、及使用久、霉爛不堪、漁民常將籠揚起、置於陸上、晒乾川為燃料、此舉於漁民方面、得益極微、而妨害魚卵之成育者甚大、亦存取締必要、　網捕稚魚、舟山·中街山·及馬安山諸羣島一帶、現用之海蜒網，大捕網等、其目的雖不在撈捕小墨魚、然因其網目過小、而使用時期、又正値小墨魚初由魚卵孵化而出、飄流海中之際、囚此、往往有大量之幼稚墨魚與他種魚類同時入網、此種網具、頗有碍墨魚之自然蕃殖、亦宜亟行取締、惟查海蜒網及大捕網作業、與漁民生計關係甚大、非再加詳細硏究、不能確定適合之取締辦法、</p>
<p>總據上述原理、可以擬定禁漁期及取締刮晒魚籠等辦法六項如左、第一項、墨魚禁漁期定為每年六月二十日至七月二十日、在此期內、凡籠捕或網捕漁民、均禁止捕魚、第二項、凡捕墨魚之魚籠、於六月二十以後、應一律留存海中、不准取出再用、第三項、捕魚時起揚魚籠、不准撲擊、第四項、凡巳放入水中之墨魚籠、不得再行移上陆地、或移作出用、倘魚卵附着籠上過多、有碍作業時，可将舊籠山幹繩解下、投棄海中、然後換縛新籠於幹繩上、第五項、上列禁渔期及取締辦法、由本省各縣政府、漁業警察局·及建設廳·派員執行之、如人民有發現觸犯上項規定者、亦須隨時報吿上開各執行機關、第六項、漁民有犯以上各種規定者、科以五元以上之罰金、並得沒收其漁具、有犯二次以上者、除加倍懲罰外、並取消其捕魚權、以上六項取締辦法、（取締撈捕小墨魚為愼重起見擬再行硏究）均與事實吻合、施行時與漁民生計、亦無大影響、似屬可行、惟民智識淺陋、而　於習慣、恐一時不易實行、故擬提議先設實施區域試行上述辦法、在試騐實施尚無結果以前、其餘地點、仍維持原狀、以免漁業上之糾紛、至籠網捕糾紛之根本原因、在於漁民之利害衝突、（與蕃殖問题、實無關係）、其解决方法、似　光行⑩拖專用漁業權及入漁權、則一範一網、均有一定之作業地點、自不致發生衝突、而另一方面、無論籠網、均須經過登記、政府得有完善之統計、對於墨魚每年漁懒恐黾酢⒓澳~業之．盛衰、均可瞭然、於將來行政設施、自有根據、其利益亦甚大也、」</p>

<p>— 徐均</p>
<p>雖然戰塲上，因戰綫之移動，欲完套毒化，殊非易事，而街市之中，則可用空中攻擊或砲兵射擊，完全毒化之，不過市民如對防毒有相當之訓練舆認識，能鎭定心神，沉着處置，亦不足為懼，蓋使用毒氣之目的，非僅殺傷敵方軍民，實在掇箭敵方人心，危害其秩序，併收殺傷與精神之效也。</p>
<p>六，防毒應注意之事項</p>
<p>我國當局，西國際風雲之緊張，列强戰備之激烈，於過去兩年中，曾有一二次之防空展覧與防空演習，當時並組織多數宣傳隊，沿街張貼標語，散步傳單，講演防禦方法，灌輸種種之知識，對於市民防毒防空，頗多指導，茲將應行注意之點，略述於下：</p>
<p>人員之選擇甲，担任防空防毒之宣傳，組織，訓練，指導等工作人員，當以防空防毒專門人材為主，但最低限度，亦須對軍事學識非常豐富者。乙，對講解或敎授之材料，須極有心得，且能設身處地，詳加解釋，俾市民得以澈底領悟。丙，藉軍事頭腦，對毒氧效力，有相當測度，而不過事誇張，以免市民心懷恐怖。丁，以實地經騐，講解防禦方法，待眞正毒氣來臨，使市民不致慌亂，可保持秩序安寗。戊，對防禦器材之指示，須以簡單經濟而又方便者為主，切不可偏重於一方。</p>
<p>防禦之方法　各個防禦之器材，防毒面具固甚好，但而具為國家武器，當不能随便發給民間，且以經濟支絀之我國，對國防軍隊防毒面具之補充，尙感不足，若欲發給人民，事實上亦難辦到，若由人民購買，現在我國亦無大規模製造工場，以供市民之需，縱使設立工塲，大批製造，而我贫困之國足（每只價約十二元）又難各備一只，即一般中產市民，可備一只，而使用與保存方法，亦須相當之敎育與練習也，徵諸實際，最好採取下列簡便方法（子）凡一切有效之毒氣，均比空氣重，有向下流動之性質，最好之防禦法，在向高處跑（如登樓上山等）（丑）施放毒氣，對風向影響甚巨，有隨風流動之趨勢，欲避免之，可向左右或上風去」┄寅）凹地及衖堂，為毒氣儲藏之所，蓋其不易渙發也，宜注意避免之」┄即）凡具有殺　性能之毒氣，其作用發生，須數小時甚至數日之久，若救護迅速，即無危險，如此情形，可速往避難所或救　所救治」┄辰）催淚性毒氣，非極大濃度，不致宵生命危險，如遇着時，可將雙目緊閉，最久亦不過一小時即可（巳）許多毒氣多與水起分解　浸濕之手巾蒙於口及鼻上，亦可防禦，縱不與水分解之毒氣，亦可使吸收量减輕」┄午）集團防禦之方法，當為防毒掩蔽部，但亦受經濟限制，為方便計，最好利用樓房之下部，改為防毒避難所，惟我國一般房屋，雖寬闊空曠，然材料單薄，一遇轟炸，皆成灰燼，且瓦隙壁縫極多，更有漏毒危險，而叛式市房，材料較强，但適用者甚少，為適合防毒問題，都市建築物之改良，當推首務也」┄附錄避難所應備條件及注意事項如下）。一，改造手續簡單，容易避入，且與食物貯盛處接近。二，構築嚴密，外間流動空氣，不易侵入。三，進出口之門，須有兩層，且相距須在四足以上（救護所則須八尺）俾進出時不致同時掀開兩門簾，門簾之設置亦須嚴密。四，尋常砲彈，炸彈，不致炸壞，故構築須堅固。五，避難所內，旣與外間空氣隔絕，而人数眾多，當然需要　氣供給，故須有通風設備，所通入之空氣，須絰過滤毒器具，至其通風法，用人工或機械均可。六，為防止毒氣侵入計，內部氣壓，須大於外面。七，地下須舖石灰一層，以吸收人口呼出之炭酸氣，八，出避難所時，須將脚上白色（石灰或漂白粉）痕跡去掉，免被敵機察覺，</p>
<p>七，消毒與救護</p>
<p>消毒方法，難為消毒隊之專任，然民眾亦應知其槪要，以備臨時之處置」┄甲）地區消毒之方法：（子）燃燒法，如某地區有毒氣（除液體）可用燃燒法，藉氣體體積膨脹，而驅逐之」┄丑）堆土法，如某地區有液體毒氣，可用堆土以掩埋之」┄寅）噴水法，如某地區有性質不安定之毒氣，可用水使其分解」┄乙）裝具消毒之方法：（子）吹風法，如装具染有毒氣，可懸於大風口上，任其吹動，可將毒氣除去」┄丑）晒晾法，如裝具染有毒氣，可置於太陽中晒晾，可使毒氣分解」┄寅）煮沸法，如裝具染有毒氣，可置水中煮沸，藉蒸氣壓力、可將毒氣除去」┄卯）其他如余屬器具染有毒氣時，可用石油，或揮發油塗搽之，亦可消毒」┄丙）救護之方法：（子）將中毒者，移至安全地點，不可使其受過分之震動」┄丑）與以濃茶及咖啡並强心劑，使共精种恢復」┄寅）使高枕仰臥於新鮮空氣中，必要時給以　氣，並須保持體溫」┄卯）速將衣服脫去，換給新衣，但不可震動」┄辰）迅速求助於醫生。</p>
<p>八，結論</p>
<p>根據以上所述，毒氣並非可怕之物，且防禦消除與救護，亦甚便利，一遇毒氣攻擊，首在精神鎭靜，動作敏捷，嚴守紀律，尊重秩序，按情勢而採取適當之動作，苟不如是，則受毒之傷害小，而自相殘踏之傷寄大矣，尤以我國國民組織訓練以及智識等等，均甚幼稚，對恪守紀律，遵守秩序，不可不特加注意也。</p>

<p>增鑄鎳幣</p>
<p>新輔幣自于本力十日正式發行後、因各地紛紛要求兌換、需要激增、以致原有鑄成鎳幣三種、銅幣二種均感不敷分配、其中允以二十分鎳幣、最戚缺乏、因該項原胚、悉係從外國運來、首批到滬爲數不多、故發行未及數日、卽已吿罄、茲聞第二批廿分鎳質原胚、已于日前運到、卽由中央造幣廠大量鼓鑄、並印刻花紋、計共增鑄二十四萬元、裝成八十大箱、每箱計一萬五千枚、値三千元、于前昨兩日、陸續運往中央銀行、分發各地兌換、流通市面、此後常暫時不致感缺乏矣、</p>
<p>嚴查僞造</p>
<p>中央造幣廠、奉財政部令、以新補幣發行未久、市上竟開已有偽造贗質者發現、令飭派員澈查眞相、如果屬實、應嚴予取締云云、該廠奉令後、業已從事嚴密查究、以憑取締、據該廠負責人語記者、奸徒僞造贗質新輔幣之事、風聞已有多日、是吾事實雖不可知、但市上旣已有少數發現、自應迅加取締、杜絕弊端、以防患于未來、鎳幣質雖堅硬、鼓鑄不易、但以原胚係從外洋運來、倘流入奸徒手中、祇須加印花紋一層手續、僞造自有機會、惟僞幣花紋大都惡劣模糊、與眞幣精細淸晰者比較、不難鑒別云、</p>

<p>— 魯迅</p>
<p>我記得曾有一個時候，我們很少能够從本國的刊物上，知道一點蘇聯的情形。雖是文藝罷，有些可敬的作家和學者們，也如千金小姐的遇到柏油一樣，不但决不沾手，離得還遠呢，却已經皺起了鼻子。近一兩年可不同了，自然間或還看見幾幅從外國刋物上取來的諷刺畫，但更多的是眞心的紹介着建設的成績，令人擡起頭來，看見飛機，水閘，工人住宅，集體農場，不再專門兩眼看地，惦記着破皮鞋搖頭歎氣了。這些紹介者，都並非有所謂可怕的政治傾向的人，但决不幸災樂禍，因此看得鄰人的平和的繁榮，也就非常高興，並且將這高興來分給中國人。我以爲爲中國和蘇聯兩國起見，這現象是極好的，一面是眞相爲我們所知道，得到瞭解，一面是不再誤解，而且證明了我們中國，確有許多「威武不能屈，貧賤不能移」的必說眞話的人們。</p>
<p>但那些紹介，都是文章或照相，今年的版畫展覽會，却將墾術直接陳列在我們眼前了。作者之中，很有幾個是由於作品的複製，姓名已爲我們所熟識的，但現在才看到手製的原作，使我們更加覺得親密。</p>
<p>版畫之中，木刻是中國早已發明的，但中塗衰　，五年前從新興起的是取法於歐洲，與古代木刻並無關係。不久，就遭壓迫，父缺師資，所以至今不見有特別的進步。我們在這會裏才得了極好，極多的模範。首先應該注意的是內戰時期，就改革木刻，從此不斷的前進的巨匠法復爾斯基（V．Favorsky），和他的一派兌內加（A．Deineka），岡察洛夫（A．Goncharv），葉卡斯託夫（G．Echerstov），畢珂夫（M．Pikov）等，他們在作品裏各各表現着眞　的精神，繼起者怎樣照着導師所指示的道路，却用不同的方法，使我們知道只要內容相同，方法不妨各異，而依傍和模仿，决不能產生眞藝術。</p>
<p>兌內加和葉卡斯託夫的作品，是中國未會紹介過的，可惜這裏也很少；和法復爾期基接近的保夫理諾夫（P．Pavlinov）的木刻，我們只見過一幅，現在却彌補了這缺憾了。</p>
<p>克拉甫兼珂（A．Krarchnko）的木刻能够幸而寄到中國，翻印紹介了的也只有一幅，到現在大家才看見他更多的原作。他的浪曼的色彩，會鼓動我們的靑年的熱情，而注意於背景和細緻的表現，也將使觀者得到裨益。我們的繪画，從宋以來就盛行「寫意」，兩點是眼，不知是長是圓，一畫是烏，不知是　是燕，競尙高簡，變成空虛，這弊病還常見於現在的靑年木刻家的作品裏，克拉甫兼珂的新作「尼泊爾建造』（Dnerrostoruy），是驚起道種懶惰的空想的警鐘。至於畢斯凱萊夫（N．Piskarev），則恐怕是最先紹介到中國來的木刻家，他的四幅「鐵流」的挿畫，早爲許多靑年讀者所欣賞，現在才又見了『安娜。加里尼娜』的挿畫——他的刻法的別一端。</p>
<p>這里又有密德羅辛（D．Mrtiokhin），希仁斯基（L．Khizhinsky），莫察羅夫（S．Mochalov），都會爲中國預先所知道，以及許多第一决看見的藝術家，是從十月革命前已經有名，以至生於二十世紀初的靑年藝術家的作品，都在向我們說明通力合作，進向平和的建設的道路。别的作者和作品，展覽會的說明書上各有簡耍的說明，而且臨末還揭出了全體的耍點：「一般的社會主義的內容和對於現實主義的根本的努力」，在這里也無須我贅說了。</p>
<p>但我們還有應當注意的，是其中有烏克蘭，喬其亞，白俄羅斯的藝術家的作品，我想，倘沒有十月革命，這些作品是不但不能和我們見面，而且也未必會得出現的。</p>
<p>現在，二百餘幅的作品，是已經燦爛的一同出現於上海了。單魷版畫而論，使我們看起來，牠不像法國作品的多爲織美，也不像德國作品的多爲豪放；然而牠眞摯，却非固執，美麗，却非淫艷，愉快，却非狂歡，有力，却非粗暴；但又不是靜止的，牠令人覺得一種震動——這　動，恰如用堅實的步法，一步一步，踏着　實的廣大的黑土進向建設的路的大隊友軍的足　。</p>
<p>附記：會中的版畫，計有五種。一木刻，一膠刻（目錄譯作「油布刻」，頗怪），看名目自明。兩種是用鏹水浸蝕銅版和石刻而成的，譯作「銅刻」和「石刻」固可，或如目錄，譯作「蝕刻『和』石印」亦無不可。還有一種Monotyhe，是在版上作畫，再用紙印，所以雖是版畫，却只一幅的東西，我想只好譯作「獨幅版畫」。會中的說明書上譯作『摩諾』，還不過等於不譯，有時譯爲『單型學」，却未免比不譯更難懂了。其實，那不題撰人的說明，是非常簡而得要的，可惜譯得很費解，如果有人改譯一遍，即使在閉會之後，對於留心版畫的人也還是很有用處的。</p>

<p>— 盛克中</p>
<p>一　引言</p>
<p>自實業界中有呈請財政部减低利息救濟實業後，此問題遂為世人所注目。惟欲减低放欵利率，先决問題，為存欵利率之减低，因銀錢業所獲得之純利息，係由存放間利率之差而來也。一月十七日報載銀錢業將組委員會專門研究减低利息有云：</p>
<p>「銀錢業之放欵，均係吸收存欵而來，如專减低放欵利息，而不減低存欵利息，則將無法營業。今存欵利息……外商銀行最高約五　，華商最高約年息一分，錢莊最高約月息一分。至於放欵利息，外商銀行暨華商銀行，錢莊最低約六　，最高約一分二三　，均視市面銀根而定。萬一實行之後，對於已成立存欵及放欵，均應有補救辦法」。</p>
<p>由於上述情形，吾人可知銀行錢業完全在自身利益立場上謀放欵利率之減低。換言之，減低利息，以輕實業界之負擔，固所願意，惟决不能犧牲自身之利益，則拾九資金來源之存欵謀其利率減低外，別無他法。結果銀錢業自居於局間者（或牙行業）謀借戶貸主之成交而安享佣金。但在存欵被銀錢業企業家利用投機之形勢下，銀錢業不能不謀一適當辦法以使存戶滿意。故減低利息，在實業界渴望之餘，言之甚易，而在銀錢業行之則非易事也。茲將上海各銀行利率概况敘述於後，再行研究減低之方策。</p>
<p>二　銀行利率概况</p>
<p>銀行利率可分為存放兩大類。存欵利率又可分為普通存欵利率與儲蓄存欵利率兩類。分述如此：</p>
<p>（甲）普通存欵</p>
<p>定期存欵　此項存款以交通，上海，中國企業，中華勸工，永享，中孚，中國，中國通商，中南，四明，墾業，聚興誠，中國實業，中匯，浙江興業，中國國貨，恒利，國華，十八家銀行為代表。其時期自三個月起至五年止。利率最高為年息一分二釐，最低位年息四釐，詳情如次表：</p>
<p>時期　最高　最低　平均</p>
<p>活期存欵　此項存欵，以交通·上海綢業·中匯·墾業·四明·中南·通商·上海女子·中國企業·十家銀行為代表，其利率最高年息四厘，但　加息關係，亦有高至五厘，最低二厘。計二厘者二家，三厘者五家，四厘者三家。</p>
<p>（乙）儲蓄存欵</p>
<p>各行儲蓄存欵名目甚多，事實上不能以定期活期區分之，必須依存取方法之不同而分類，茲就最要者四種分述之。</p>
<p>整存零付　此項存欵以中國·浙江實業·上海·鹽業·四明·新華·東萊·大陸·國華·墾業·農工·中匯·勸工·中國企業·恒利·上海綢業·中國國貨·中南·江蘇·通商·二十家銀行為代表，最低年限以一年為標準，最高年限以十年以上為標準，其利率最低年息五厘，最高一分二厘。詳情如次表：</p>
<p>零存整取　此項存欵，以中國·浙江興業·浙江實業·上海·鹽業·四明·金城·新華·東萊·大陸·中國實業·國華·中國墾業·農工·聚興誠·中匯·中國企業·上海綢業·江浙·中國國貨·中南·江蘇·通商·二十三家銀行為代表，其時期與上述者同，其利率最低為六厘，最高為一分二厘，詳情如此表：</p>
<p>存本付息　此項存欵以中國·浙江興業·浙江實業·上海·鹽業·中孚·四明·金城·新華·大陸·國華·墾業·農工·聚興誠·中匯·中國企業·上海綢業·江浙·中國國貨·中南·江蘇·通商·二十二家銀行為代表，其時期之長短與上述二者同，其利率最低為六釐，最高為一分一釐，詳情如次表：</p>
<p>整存整付　此項存欵以中國、浙江興業、浙江實業、上海、中孚、金城、新華、大陸、農工、聚興誠、勸工、中國企業、恒利、中國國貨、中南、江蘇、通商、十七家銀行為代表。其時間自三個月起為最短，十年以上為最長。其利率最低五厘。最高一分二厘。詳情如此表。</p>
<p>以上各表係就交換銀行之存欵章程加以統計，時期之長短劃分完全以便利統計為前提，事實上各行年限或規定在十年以上，或在十年以內，故有數表最高最低之利率，並不因年限之加長而　增。平均數亦受此影響；但大體上皆符合年限與利率成正比例之原則也。</p>
<p>放欵利率</p>
<p>各銀行放欵利率，並無一定之規章，可資統計，因利率之高低，全視金融之鬆緊，與夫借貸主認定資本價值之多少，競爭之有無，支付能力之強弱，投資之安危而定。茲就調查所得之資料表列如下：</p>
<p>以上各行利率，除交通未註明年利或月利，浙江實業註明年利外，其他皆為月利。如合成年利，則最低為八厘四，最高為一分四厘四。雖然，放欵利率既視客戶情形，金融市况而隨時訂定，事業上銀行放欵利率，最高低究屬如何，亦頗可研究。茲就中行月刊（二十四年八月份）與中央銀行金融週報（本年一月份各期）所載，　集於後：</p>
<p>機關　借欵名稱　利率</p>
<p>導淮委員會　導淮借欵　年息　六％</p>
<p>建設委員會　江南鐵路借欵　八％</p>
<p>江蘇省　建設借欵　年息　九％</p>
<p>江蘇省籌建倉庫借欵　年息　七·五％</p>
<p>江蘇省水利公債借欵　年息　八％</p>
<p>江蘇省　蠶種借欵　年息一〇</p>
<p>江蘇省　導淮續借欵　年息　八％</p>
<p>浙江省　公路借欵　年息　九％</p>
<p>浙江省　秋　借欵　年息　一〇％</p>
<p>浙江省　地方公債借欵　年息　八％</p>
<p>浙江省　地方公債續借欵　年息　一〇％</p>
<p>湖北省　水災公債借欵　九％</p>
<p>陝西省　引渭借欵　月息　八％</p>
<p>上表所列均為政府機關貸欵之利率，僅可供吾人之參證，至對實業界貸欵之利率，殊無法搜求加以統計也。</p>
<p>縱覽上列各表，我國銀行存欵利率之高，較十七日報載最高約一分實遠過之；其存期一年者，高達年息一分，存期三年者，更高達年息一分二厘，存欵利率既如此，宜乎放欵利率亦高達月息一分二厘矣。最近報載金融界某氏謂銀行以高利吸收存欵，投機於外匯，投機於公債，利厚而手續簡，不若投資於實業之須調查考察，利薄而事繁也，寥寥數語，銀行界所抱之態度，刻畫盡　。</p>
<p>今後我國銀行業茍為其自身利益打算，以高利吸收存欵營投機之事業，固無庸减低利率——根本亦不可能；設抱共存共榮之心，實無待實業界之呼　，而自動减低利率，使實業界能有低利資金之運用也。</p>
<p>三標準最高低利率</p>
<p>利息高低，本無須限制，其趨勢全視金融季節與借貸主間需求情形而漲落。若必以法令規章限定利率，多數為對債權人之失當干涉，且結果恐僅絕資金貧乏之者融通之途徑，况利之所在，誰能捨之？事實上亦難生效。故本節所謂標準高低利率者，含有兩重意義：一為禁止以高利率吸收存欵，一為放欵利率之最高標準。蓋利率高低尙須視國內文明程度如何，文明程度高，則人民智識進步，金融機關完備，人必無受高利之苦，若相反，人必受高利之累。我國敎育局向不普及，傳統上復有高利貸制度，加以近年銀行高利吸收存欵，故事實上不能不定一適當利率，以為過渡時之辦法也。其次，我國現在放欵利率，亦頗不一致，如對政府機關貸欵利率低自年息六厘，高達年息一分，而調查所得各行多為月息八厘至一分二厘，此其一。今實業界要求减低利率，則减低之程度在目今亦須有一極限，使兩能裨益，此其二。有此二因，不能不定一標準最高低利率。</p>
<p>但此標準頗難擬訂，既恐失之過低，復失之太高。茲就前列各表平均數情形，草擬高低利率如下：</p>
<p>（一）普通存欵利率　此項存欵性質與儲蓄存欵異，利率自應較低，訂定最高標準如表：</p>
<p>時期　一年　二年　三年　四年　五年</p>
<p>利率　六·〇〇％　六·　　％　六·　〇％　六·七　％　七·〇〇％</p>
<p>（二）儲蓄存欵利率　上述各平均數之趨勢大率初年增加較速於後年，本表亦如之，訂定最高標準如表：</p>
<p>時期　一年　二年　三年　四年　五年</p>
<p>利率　六·〇〇％　六·五〇％　七·〇〇％　七·二三％　七·五％</p>
<p>六年　七年　八年　九年　十年　十年以上</p>
<p>七·七五％　八〇〇％　八·二五％　八·五〇％八·七五％　九·〇〇％</p>
<p>（三）放欵利率　甲，月息六厘至八厘，乙，月息五厘至七厘。</p>
<p>存欵利率，率以一年為標準，其在一年以內者，各行可自行規定，惟存期在九個月內者最高不能過六厘。又僅訂最高而不訂最低者，因目下為减低問題，且亦不必要也。</p>
<p>放欵利率，據聞某銀行對救濟工商業特別押欵僅月息五厘。又據全國經濟委員會棉業統制委員會出版之「棉紡織廠經營標準」一書，定利息費用為年息七厘八厘。則草擬放欵利率月息五厘至八厘，大約並不致失之過高最低。雖然，以此標準與各先進國較，固尙高出甚多也。</p>
<p>四實行减低利率之辦法</p>
<p>實行减低利率所發生之問題，不在放欵利率，而在存欵利率，實則更不在存欵利率，而在銀行界之態度。因在實行時對未成立之存欵放欵不生問題，問題在已成立存欵與放欵補救辦法問題。將　依照原約辦理乎？抑　改訂新約辦理乎？若依照第一法則銀行不致預防存戶提存而安心運用其資金：但今後放欵僅能低利貸出，結果銀行恐將虧蝕；是第一法防止提存有益於銀行，高利吸入，低利貸出，有損於銀行。若依照第二法則銀行對於存戶之提存將不可避免，惟存息低，放欵亦低，銀行有利可圖：是第二法存戶提存有損於銀行，低利吸入，低利貸出，有益於銀行。似乎二法各有利弊。實則吾以為改訂新約辦理為是，何則？存戶提存必不致發生也。因；</p>
<p>個銀行利率一致减低，存　銀行此利率，調存乙銀行亦此利率，决不會特別優待也。</p>
<p>提存於商號，則存戶對商號之信心究不　對銀行之厚，利率高低不敵投資安全之為先要也。</p>
<p>提存於洋商銀行，則年來外商銀行之倒閉者時見報載，國人受累者頗不乏人，不足以起國人之信心。</p>
<p>提存以投資於地產債券，則存戶能投資於此兩者决不致將欵存入銀行，存入銀行者决無甚大之興趣投資於地產債券，斯可斷言。</p>
<p>故依作者之愚，無論舊存放，新存放，一律依照新標準辦理為佳。</p>
<p>五結論</p>
<p>减低利率以救濟工商業，其重要無待　言。惟在實行之後應有數問題加以注意，一為普遍禁止高利問題，一為嚴謹投機問題。關於前者則目今一般商店，小公司，小銀行其存期一年月息一分者頗多，難免一般人惑於高低忘其危機而蹈之，故不能不嚴行禁止，關於後者不但須禁止銀錢業之投機，工商業之投機，尤須絕對禁止。蓋利率之高，全為投機利益甚厚，投機風　，銀行業遂不惜提高利率以營投機，結果對工商放欵利率自高。故投機必嚴厲禁止。</p>
<p>作者對銀行實踐無深切之研究，本文全從統計學之立場以研究减低利息，是否有當，尙希專家正之。</p>
<h3 id="c150">籌設中央土地銀行之效益 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— 黃公安</p>
<p>日前吾人所建議於中央，設立中央土地銀行，以期促進中國的土地改革運動及謀獲發展中國的土地經濟與信用一案，已予採納，並於五全大會通過，訓令財內兩部核辦。深為敬佩！維籌備中央土地銀行，雖見諸報端。但究之何日可得實况？其籌備的計劃如何？是否全部依吾人之建議進行，抑或有所變更！至今尚無所聞見。以中央土地銀行之設立，乃為國家社會事業的新創舉，既乏成法之可循，亦無經騐之可資，舉大投艱，稍一不慎，亦可產生不良之影響。用特不揣冒昧，願　一言，以為告。</p>
<p>竊以為，中央土地銀行之設立，固不只為中國土地改革運動建立一個新基礎。然就國家的財政立場來說：中央土地銀行之成立，第一可使中國不動產資金化　的創造資本的新動向，達於實現。其次可使中國在資力萬分貧弱與枯竭中，發現了一個，取之不盡，用之不竭的土地信資用資本的大財源。其三，可使農業金融活動，易於舉辦改良土地，從而得以迅速增加土地的價值及促進農業生產與實業之建設。凡此種種，直接間接，皆足以增加政府稅收，打開鉅大的財政來源。最後財政部舉辦此種銀行，不用籌集大量資本，而反收穫得龐大而穩健的資本之創造。則吾人以為土地銀行之設立，非為改革中國土地之計，亦即改造中國財政之一大計劃也。</p>
<p>至於中央土地銀行之設立，事屬創舉，前已言及。而其組織又與普通之工商業銀行，截然不同，益以中國目前此種土地銀行之專門人才，亦屬少見。即日本至今亦未聞有土地銀行之建立。處此情形之下，夫如何而後可使土地銀行之組織，得美滿發揮其種種特長與效能？土地債券，應如何進行？土地債券之發行額，究應以若何程度，方能相當於社會上的真正需要？放欵制度，如何確定？企業金融，如何籌集？執業人材，如何羅致與培養？凡此種種問題，自當為目前籌備中央土地銀行中，所最感困難的問題。此皆為土地銀行成立之先决問題，亦即吾人所期望者也。</p>
<p>查土地銀行，起源盛行於德意志，作者前在中央日報刊載的地方週刊曾有專論介紹。即吾人前日之建議中央土地銀行，亦非出自吾人虛構，換言之，德國乃係土地信用銀行之策源地。彼方人士，對於此種銀行之組織。管理與運用，成效最著，且人才與經騐，俱稱豐富。故彼方土地銀行的組織制度，最堪值得吾人借鏡與留意。故鄙意以為在中央土地銀行籌備之初，對於土地銀行之機能，未　運用，為慎重計，為求事業之健全發展計，為求銀行之易於成立計，最好能直接派人前往德邦，多加實際的研究與考查，或直接聘請一二德國土地信用專家來華指導，使吾國可得泰山之助。則事業自屬易舉，並同時定可减免幾許嘗試的冒險性，此又為吾人所期望者也。</p>
<p>雖然，前所云云，祗為當局貢獻意見。但吾人認為中央土地銀行之設立，非唯於政府當局有密切之關係，同時，該行之設，對於中國銀行事業，亦有莫大之影響，此中之利害因果，深恐未為中國銀行界所認識，特貢數言以供參考。蓋中國過去之銀行制度，建築於現金準備。此種制度，在理論上雖可謂為穩健安全之制度，但在實際上，現金死藏地窖，置有用之現金現銀於無為之地，其非合於經濟主義的原則，固不待經濟學者，方能言之，况當國家外交多難之秋，一旦國際戰爭爆發，銀行必為敵人所襲擊，或先奪取我人之現金準備而去，斯時社會上雖有鈔票之流通，但勢必等於空頭無用矣。結果一方面足以致全國金融機構之崩潰，他方面定必使戰時財政之破敗，陷戰事於不利，此則又因近年各國幣制戰爭（Wahrungskrieg）愈演愈烈，用金用銀之制，朝令　改，變換　常。此種幣制之缺乏安定性，尤最易惹起現金準備制度之破產，如前年，美國之改行金銀本位制，實行收買白銀政策，立即牽動我國大量現銀之外流，使上海各銀行，突起莫大之危險，即美商銀行竟因此而倒閉，此皆是以明顯告訴現金準備銀行制度之弱點。然幸自去年起財政當局，已深知此種制度之不可久延，毅然頒布幣制改革的新方案，實行法幣制度，此種措施，已能挽救現存銀行制度之弱點，但亦未得調為已達極度之澈底改革銀行現金準備制度的機構，前者是分配準備，今則是集中準備而已。究之尙是需要現金，仍不免前已列舉之種種危險性，故不能算為完全之新式銀行制度。</p>
<p>唯吾人所建議之土地銀行制度，可完全廢除現金準備制度，而以有代表資本價值的土地當做準備。此種地財之準備。既不妨盜賊之掠刦，亦不處敵人之偷運，水火不能傷害，幣制戰爭，莫我奈何。且土地既用作為銀行基金之後，仍可繼續任人利用，自由生產，而完全免除現金死藏地窖而還要耗消保險金與保衛費的絕對違背經濟主義的呆滯辦法。此真天下最安全沒有之制度，亦即最經濟沒有之辦法。抑尤有進者，中國為現金資本最貧弱與最缺乏之國家。本國之地藏，雖有金銀鑛產，但向乏設廠開採之經營，故每遇國家之需要金銀，或想籌集大銀行資末，頗匪易易。若出於舉借外債，一則助長外人侵略中國經濟之勢力，再則必受高利與苛刻的政治或經濟條件的壓迫與剝削，使中國永遠淪為國際之債務國，於我有種種之不利，實屬不勝枚舉。唯其如是，所以吾國銀行事業，亦永無偉大發展之可能性。例如中國現在最大銀行如中央銀行，祗有兩千萬元資本。但英美之國家銀行，均皆超出五億或十億之資本，其相去　　天壤之別。良以我國資本貧乏，現金準備之銀行制度，不易推進。英美內本國金銀生產豐富，現金充實，難集合十億百億之銀行資本，亦不為難。蓋社會的經濟物質使然，非吾人之聰明才智不及也。反之，如中國現在能推行土地銀行新制度，即可完全避免前述種種不利之　制與影響。尤其是不需乞憐外援，乃為中國自強自立自助自奮自給與自救之最有効的辦法。蓋土地銀行制度之推行，絕不會因中國現金缺乏而受　碍，此種銀行所必要的資本不是現金而是土地。故凡有土地之面積及其價值越大，則土地銀行資本之積集亦越發容易。夫我國本為世界土地面積最大的國家，如能依此原則組織銀行，則吾國當可成立世界上最偉大之銀行。即以上海一隅之地來論，如能將全上海地產合作組成土地銀行如德國的Stadtschaften即得二十餘億之土地資本，再就南京市之地產價值之估計，亦有十數億元之鉅，如能將次組成銀行，可無需乞憐半文之外債，而吾國可產生世界上最大資力之銀行。向者不此之圖，貸棄於地，而猶　國家資力貧乏，何計之　；故為改善中國之銀行組織，與夫打開自力更生之計，深望中國銀行界，認識土地銀行之特性及其偉大的功能，一方面應設法盡力協助中央土地銀行之籌備。他方面，在可能範圍內，銀行界亦不妨多組織此種銀行，以促進中國土地信用之利用。據作者觀察，因土地銀行之組織，無需現金作準備，是則不獨城市可組織土地銀行，即在農村亦可組織也。最佳以鄉為單位，將每鄉所有之土地，用合作方法，如依照德國的Landschaften之訊織。是則中國有三十萬之鄉村，即可組成三十萬所土地合作銀行。假定每所之土地銀行資本額為五千元，則全中國總計可有十五萬萬元的土地資本，如是，可使全國佈滿銀行網，打開銀行界發展之大出路，同時農村有此十五萬萬元土地信用之救濟與流通，自可解决農村當前極嚴重之金融問題。夫而後復興農村，更生民族運動，可望達於真正之成功。</p>

<p>— 柳塘</p>
<p>上海市無名英雄幕成，爰於二月十六日行揭幕典禮。先期於九日上午十時，在廟行附近，土名三百畝頭之處，舉葬陣亡將士遺骸。查廟行之役，為滬戰中最劇烈之一戰，日軍傾其精銳，挾其新式利器以俱來，一時我師傷亡甚眾；其後即調生力軍繼之，奪還原有陣地，終師退之日，日軍不能越雷池一步，亦足豪矣。</p>
<p>事後由本市同仁輔元堂搜得遺骸，分別　埋。此次欲於其中檢屍骨一具，移葬於無名英雄墓，遂由上海殘疾院　者摸索指定之。　者略曉星卜，頗鄭重其事，冥索東西，　行南北，終於原進口處之墓地上指定一具，同地　埋者凡六十七，此即六十七棺中之一也。</p>
<p>所奇者，各棺不盡無名，當同仁輔元堂掩埋之時，遇有胸口符號，其姓氏部屬可辨者，鐫刻於墓　上，備其後裔來認，法至完密；獨此　者所指定之一具，無姓氏可考，棺啟而呈於眼前者，為一副紫醬色之屍骨，缺其左臂左腿。乃為之奉安於石棺內，棺中舖以灰粉，墊以黃綢褥，將屍骨置於上，蓋以綢被，然後封蓋密口，移葬於無名英雄之墓。</p>
<p>有為堪　之說者，屍骨恒為灰白，其得紫色者，後嗣必昌，果爾，此亦天之所以報忠魂　！</p>
<p>行揭幕禮之日，午後，民眾之往瞻禮者數千人，熱烈得未曾見，多有持　箔前往焚化，可見敬仰之深切矣。</p>

<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>從前到南市去遊玩，只有一所城隍廟。那裏香烟繚繞，市聲喧鬧，愛清靜些的人，真有些吃不消。現在有了文廟公園，清潔高尚，勝過城隍廟好多倍，毋怪遊人趨之若驚了。不錯！那裏有花草樹木，亭石池沼，風景點綴得很美麗；而且有圖書報紙可閱，還陳列各種模型古器，足以廣眼界，增智識；城裏頭幾位愛聽書的朋友，到了裏邊，也有好書聽，還有便宜茶喝。所以我常和朋友們說笑，要是我居住南市的話，一定搬在文廟附近，早晚坐上幾個鐘點，豈不比關在客室裏要爽快許多；而且對過又是動物園，有便去聽聽鳥語猿啼，看看魚游獸躍，也是一件快樂事情。所以我不到南市則已，到了南市，總到裏邊去逛上幾個鐘點。</p>
<p>現在的文廟公園，鬧中取靜，遊人如鯽，一談起二十五年前的情形却不對了。那時上海的城垣，還沒拆除，租界和城內的交通，靠着幾個城門出進，還不十分便利。尤其是西門一帶，荒僻異常。文廟一帶，不要說晚上，便是白畫也少行人經過。那時文廟的大門，還是舊式建築，黑漆而繪有神像的大門，高有幾尺的門檻，除了春秋二祭以外，總是常年的關着。門前一帶照牆；面前一帶菜圃；西角的魁星閣，高高的　立；正中的大成殿，四壁生苔；一泓池水，也常年的呈着綠色。當時進去的人，只覺得莊嚴中帶着幾分淒涼。誰料一番改革，闢作公園以後，大成殿仍是大成殿，魁星閣仍是魁星閣，池沼依舊，樹木無恙，而風景却大不相同。文化愈演而愈進，我對於文廟的現在和過去，却有同樣的感慨了！</p>

<h3 id="c159">其美路平民新村巡禮 <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>衣食住行為生活四大要素：可是在上海，這住的問題要算最難解決。那不但是環境複雜，空氣污染，有影響於身心健康；而且房租的高貴，也實在使一般薪給階級與勞動階級者有不勝負担之苦。然而為了生活，對於這些問題終於無法解決。</p>
<p>最近市府當局有鑒於此，故去年在本市其美路，中山路，大木橋，普善橋等處，建築了四個平民新村；現各處之工程已次序完竣，並且一般居民亦均以相機潛入居住了。</p>
<p>我為了要想知道一些村中的情形，所以在一個寒冷的清晨，特地到其美路平民新村去巡　了一週。村在其美路第二號橋小面，地址向陽，因此村中頗為和暖。入口處有兩個，式樣有些相像公學或校園之門；中央是禮堂，辦公處及閱報室，房屋作八字形，門前分　族旗　兩根，　報牌及佈告牌各一，對面一個廣場便是運動場。村中共有房屋二百六十間，分甲乙兩種，甲類三元，乙種四元；房屋之構造極其簡單整齊，每　至多五六家昆連，屋前後及兩側都留有餘地，可供栽植花木，是以不獨室內光綫充足，空氣流暢，並且因為各處邊設救火機與太平龍頭的原故，所以很是安全。村之四角各有一個公廁所和自來水池，自來水池每隻分作十多格，每格上均裝有自來水龍頭，旁邊還有一隻長丈餘的水門汀製的洗　台，每次同時十多個人可洗　東西。村里的道路全是水門汀舖的，而每個轉角上都裝有路燈，入夜村中還有警士通夜巡邏，故村民都可安居。</p>
<p>禮堂背後是消費合作社，里面除了生活必需品的供應外，還有男子浴室，女子浴室，以及民衆茶園等；最後便是女子廁所。</p>
<p>村里有小學校一所，並且附設有幼稚園；凡村民的孩子在四歲以上八歲以下者可以入幼稚園；八歲至十六歲的也好進小學部。學費完全不收，只取書錢。</p>
<p>那村中的一切設備組織，都是十分嚴密整潔的，所有每間屋裏的生活設備，如：電燈，灶頭等亦統由他們裝置完全，居戶只須搬些活動傢具進去，不必自己費事。</p>
<p>甲種房屋是一個正間，一個小退間，一個小灶扉，還有一個小閣樓。晒衣架是裝在門前的。乙種是前後兩個正間，一個小撞間和一個小退間。很合單夫妻倆，和有一兩個孩子的小家庭居住。</p>
<p>我足足在村裏巡禮了兩個多鐘頭，只見許多村民們在悠閑地生活着，工作着，還有那個清道夫却在一處一處的收拾。</p>
<p>村的方向朝南，村前用竹籬打了一道圍牆，村後却有一條河流，它包圍在一片田野中間，所以每一家的屋裏都有陽光晒到。</p>
<p>「那真是一個在都市圈外的小桃源！」當我戀戀地走上歸途的時候，心裏這樣想。</p>

<p>— 夢瀾</p>
<p>吳興富商徐冠南之子徐琦仲，因爲虧欠「舞資」，「餐費」，「出差汽車費」，「時裝」，「化妝品」等賬欵三萬一千數百元，無法淸償，故向第一特區地方法院聲請破產，當經該院管理後，便在十六日午後四時召開債權人會議，到者有「舞塲大班」，「妓院主政」等，可說是洋洋大觀，頗極一時之盛。</p>
<p>不久之前，杭州有三個「家均富有」的大學生做强盜，論者除了嘆息於這是資本社會跟封建社會和姦下所作的「孽」之外，還作爲這是敎育破產的證據，現在，不料和「大學生做强盜」案相映成趣的，居然還有「富商之子」因爲還不起「　喝玩樂賬」而宣吿破產，眞可說是無獨有偶。</p>
<p>我們細細地把「大學生做强盜案」來和這件案子對照一下，除了目的，手段之不同外，在暴露敎育破產，和這個畸形社會結構二點上，簡直找不出差異的地方，所以這兒暫且不談；</p>
<p>我們所見到的是這事件的背面。</p>
<p>靑年們的私生活的糜爛，允其是都市靑年們的私生活的糜爛，那是無可吾認的事實，不過，這種靑年祗是靑年中的一小部份而不是全體，並且這一小部份不上進的靑年，其不，上進的原因很多，例如那位徐琦仲先生，便是因爲他過去的環境太好，沒有機會去看看現在的世界究竟是怎樣的一個世界的緣故；而有些「富商之子們的確目擊身經於連年來民族所遭受的苦難，因而參加於救亡運動，但因爲各方面的阻力太多，而他們還有一個過份溫暖的家可以留戀，所以他們先天的苟安的心理又滋長起來，因而更灰心起來，以爲與其這樣戴月披星的受寒挨餓，還不是短時間的盡情享樂一番，他們雖然的知道這樣的享樂不會長久，但也管不到這許多。這也是「不能上進」的一種緣故，總之徐琦仲和三個做强盜的大學生，那祗是這個不合理的社會下被犧牲者而已。</p>

<p>小主人撲着身上的骯髒，打起手照，見太陽已從對山探起頭來，他想該早一點走路子，這畜生賣相不壞，在半途上或許碰到城里的「相公」（卽洋盤的意思）旣可以多賣幾兩銀子，又可以省下鄕地蟲的抽頭，他沒有顧得今天肚子里沒有上貨，向屋子里照呼他老子動身。</p>
<p>老子忙着攤在病床上的妻子，剛端起粥碗想吞食的時候，兒子在馬房里喊着車子驚好了，爸心里不由地又好笑又好氣，捧着粥　冲出門來，斗着兒子說：</p>
<p>「傻子！賣掉了這畜生，咱們爺兒倆拉空車子回來嗎」？</p>
<p>兒子頓着脚笑了，用自己的拳頭槌着腦袋，「爸，那末把破車子一起賣了罷」。</p>
<p>「快些卸子，喝兩碗粥走路！」</p>
<p>父子倆裝飽了肚子，牽了畜生動身的時候，太陽已經升上山腰了。和溫的春風迎面拂來，他們如夢初醒，在那間茅草棚里已經藏過了一個冬日。走過東山由腰，爸回過頭去瞧瞧自家的茅棚，那輛破車子彷彿一變孩子玩具似的掉在馬柵門口，「完了」！心里想着，慢慢地步下東山。</p>
<p>兒子牽着馬鞭子在前面走，馬蹄打在石坡上的聲音好像鐵錘那樣打在爸的心坎里。他想起買這頭馬的時候，他在市集上跑了一整天，鄉地蟲手里沒有好質，後來在茶館里碰一位老趕脚的介紹他這頭馬，腿骨狭狹的，耳朶搖着，鬃毛彷彿上了油似的在太陽光下閃着金星，化了三十八兩銀子打下來，祇替那老趕脚付了碗茶資，還是千思萬謝的。他記得牽着那頭馬回來，走過東山，誰都拍着牠　　誇耀幾句，好像我發了財那樣馬興伯還向我道喜呢！眞的，這幾年來虧這畜生帮着我趕了幾趟好差使，不然老伙伴兩個墳上的靑草都長有兒子那末高了。想着，他脚步慢了下來。</p>
<p>兒子埋緊着頭，只顧走路，他知道爸心里不好過。這畜生跟着爸這許多時候，總是喂着上好的草料，趕了一趟遠脚回來，爸不肯馬土接生意，這畜生辛苦了，牽他到東山去放個趟子」，爸總是咐吩他帶着去要上二三天的。他看着畜生在太陽下仰起頭來打個呵欠，尾巴就掃了起來，像一朶好看的花。有時候偎在他的身旁，他拔着草慢慢喂牠，彷彿一個親兄弟似的，今天爲了媽的病，把牠賣了。回過頭來看着爸，爸離他有三五丈遠，像這頭老馬一樣，一步一頓，眼睛注視着自家的脚尖。</p>
<p>「爸，快點趕路啊，太陽升上腦門了！」</p>
<p>「孩子」，爸提起罩裙，趕了上來，</p>
<p>「你看這畜生還有買主嗎」？</p>
<p>「什麽？爸不想賣」？</p>
<p>「不是！這未一頭老馬，你想誰要哩！」</p>
<p>「爸趕到巿集再說罷。沒有人要，比如放個　子，帶牠回來」。</p>
<p>爸點着頭，兩個放快脚步上市集去。</p>

<p>— 宋元</p>
<p>心情是那麼的迷亂，惶惑，憂急，眼前的世界雖然繁華富有，街上電車趕上黃包車，汽車老遠又從後面趕上了電車，人的流，人的潮，在水門汀上擁擠着，銀樓的窗裏擺的是金銀，珍珠，鑽石：小飯館剛開籠的饅頭，香氣噴到街上，撲到自已的鼻子裏；可是一切都與自己不相干，飢餓之火在肚子裏燃燒着亦沒法子呌牠滿足慾望。</p>
<p>自從早上在病着的妻子的面前誇下大口，說道，「不要鬧，今天一定賺點錢回來」，出了門懷着的勇敢與理想，一陣陣地給現實的遭遇打破個粉碎乾淨。也曾厚着臉皮跑到以前做過工的廠門口哀求着拿媽溫，「給我一個短工做吧，救救一家三口的命」。却看到無情而兇惡的嘴臉，喝叱兼　駡了一聲，「沒有，赤佬」，被把門的紅頭阿三趕上那麼一棍，不跑開還得再吃洋火腿！也曾跑到碼頭邊，見着合自己遭受了差不多相同的命運的人在用肩膀載貨物，知道這是一條生路，只要自己願意吃點苦頭，一天的工錢亦不比在廠裏電氣間出大</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>汗少些，雖然心裏對於有着能够管理電氣的才能的自己有點輕視，可是爲了活命毫無猶豫地就跑向前要跟着人羣鑽進貨倉去。「猪玀，小癟三」，旁邊的鞭子迎頭就是一下，接着自己的肩膀被抓住，抓到遠點還要用脚踢，「幹嗎？偸東西」？分辯無用，解釋無用，哀求之後，姑念不懂規矩被放去了，說是，不然還要帶到行里去。對於在從前以爲是隨地有黃金可拾的天堂，—這東方的大都會—感覺到由失望而憤恨，咒詛着：「這給人幻想的地獄呵，你誘惑多少萬人從農村跑來，從各個城市奔到，原來你是設下陷阱，呌人來送命的！毀滅吧，你殺人的萬惡都會」！而一路走來，聽到的是電車叮咚地唱着勝利的歌曲，汽車還呌着譏諷的口號，人的流，人的潮，都好像在趕着慶祝的大遊行，—在向自己失意的人示威着。不相信人的流人的潮里頭沒有正合自己一樣命運的可憎動物，也合自己一樣的在迷亂，惶惑，憂急。可是每個人都那麼忽忙地走路，好像誰都是有職業的人，在急要跑到他職務所在的目的地。而自己却感到由憂急轉變成悠閒的人，慢慢地走，欣賞着馬路邊每一個有可以用的或是可以吃的，或是可以敎孩子玩的，或是可以敎　子穿的…許多物品。眼底看過的物品，時常引起從前的麥想，罵了自己道，眞是傻麼，想牠幹嗎，不是老早就沒有什麼夢想的麼？在廠里的時候，夢想還有份兒，如今什麼都絕望了，還想自己欺騙自己麼？這樣　定心，反而暫時覺得平和無所謂，已經走到這麼壞的命運，自己放明白點，也就痛苦少些了。一經這麼訓練自己，什麼羞恥心高傲性都絕袂而離開，走到大橋上看見小癟三在「拉黃牛」，也就跑上前想要賺幾個銅板了。　喂，張開眼睛，這兒沒有你的份」！他們聯合來壓迫，要動武。「我也要吃飯呀！」回答他們，强項些，拳腳已經將自己打倒在地下去了，鼻子的血在流着。</p>
<p>跑了那麼一天，失魂似地：如今天已黑。夜已來臨，再迷惑下去的話，自己得　　在馬路邊，家　的妻兄也得奄奄待斃了。夜是罪惡的，同時却亦給人以更興奮的更勇敢的力量，可以乘人不覺地滿足自己的要求，也可以安慰自己地說是這樣在黑暗中犯罪於心無愧，爲什麼不學學隔壁王老三幹的勾當呢？</p>
<p>雖然已經得手，從容地將那被威嚇者的藏有金錢的皮呷兒拿到自己的口袋裏了，可是經他一喊，帶眞傢伙的巡捕將我那拿着假傢伙的手擒住了。……</p>

<p>— 華穆</p>
<p>是一個是星耿耿的夏夜。三畫夜風濤顚簸的海行，把一副困憊極了的身心送到南中國的一個港岸的旅舍里。雖然已交二更，天氣還是悶熱得令人流汗。房間是在臨街的四層樓上，向街一面開有一扇門，懸壁築有一座小洋台，鐵欄圍左右兩頭放有兩缽盆花，一是茉莉，一是珠蘭。人站出洋臺上來海風陣陣由南吹來，比房間里凉快得多了。</p>
<p>這了港埠在南中國算來也算得是一個相常繁盛的商埠，建築都是四五層的高樓，只是物質條件到底限制了它的發展，那兒的市街交通還是黃包車爲主要工具。汽車是不多見的，入夜以後，商店都把鐵棚門關上了，入們穿上輕裝便服，擺起閑散的步子，拖着一雙木屐從這條街踅過那條街，調笑着街頭的賣唱女。那踏在士敏土街心的木展聲，就彷如夏夜雨後水田裏的蛙聲，北來初旅的旅人聽來是會覺得非常新鮮有趣的。等到木屐聲漸漸沉隱下去，街是變得冷靜起來，就又聽得到由歌樓旅舍樓窗之間流溢出來的顫亮的肉聲，和淫逸的琴韻。這肉聲琴韻，算是點綴了這個南中國港岸的繁華景象。</p>
<p>我住的房間那面洋臺雖說是臨街開着，其實面的還是一條從外街通到裏街的巷道，巷道兩邊都是住房的建築，昏沉無力的巷燈光下，間也走邊一兩個行人。兩邊的黑漆大門沉沉地緊關着，景象是怪幽靜的。這時忽然叮——噹一聲，巷的轉角處，一輛漆亮的車上靠着個艷裝的麗人，影影妁妁的，又可叮——噹一聲，　與車影都沒　巷的前　晤影裏去了。這光影一現似的美麗縹渺的畫圖，不禁深深的撩亂了疲憊的漂泊者的心，　躺在天鵝絨的睡　里做了一塲緋夢，待遠樓上的歌聲琴韻穿嬙度巷的送進耳邊後，我惘然若失了。</p>
<p>那是一鋼初秋的月夜，南中國的唯一的大城市已沉入於睡的靜態裏了。月光像水一般　瑩的照着街路旁的槐樹，東面越秀山的峰影，沉睡得有如一隻靑藍色的絨球，山腰的路燈，閃灼如嵌在那兒的珠子，雖是秋天，還沒有一點凉意。我正病着，住在一間醫院裏，病房在三樓，窗子正臨南邊的馬路。那時候，月光從窗口瀉進來，樓廳里沉靜得沒有一點聲息。我睡不着，心裏在念着家和可愛的親人。正在難解難分之際，一聲幽揚凄楚的　笛，悠悠的飄進窗子裏來，那淸而不激的調子和着女人的中昔階的歌唱，完全是南中國的情　啊，凄靡，哀感，動人，我幾乎聽得泣下了。</p>
<p>支持着軟弱的病軀，忘記我是病人經不得夜深風露的吹襲，倚在窗口邊，淸塋的月光下，我看淸楚是兩個人的瘦影，踏着槐樹的影子，正向窗下走來。一聲笛，一聲歌，在淸冷的午夜，她們在企求誰個好心腸的人家，從窗口擲下一兩個銅子去。</p>
<p>我嘆息著，終於流下淚來。</p>

<p>市音（一三四〇）上午十時至十一時</p>
<p>開篇「春游曲」</p>
<p>弱柳絲絲起嫩黃。桃花含蕊競新妝。春色惱人眠不得。一枝紅杏出東牆。點綴春光和煦裏。紅肥綠瘦鬥奇香。一葉一花均入畫。鶯啼燕笑蝶蜂狂。更喜那·草木逢春都康健。連朝風信醒黃粱。一望平原風景好。好花枝·常伴紫薇朗。相約朋　游春去。迎人小草拂橫塘。還喜那·柳欲抽條桃欲放。自有深情費較量。要曉得·佳景原來春最好。天然圖畫在江鄉。待到那·三月春光深處裏。千紅萬紫更芬芳。不過是·一樣韶華有幾樣看。我來分別話端詳。有的是·少婦思春心繚亂。困人天氣更茫茫。偶見陌頭楊柳綠。倒說道·夫婿封侯願未嘗。有的是·少女名媛在　房裏。深閨寂寂　鴛鴦。忽覺惱人春色到。手倦拋書午夢長。有的是·伉儷情深情脈脈。憑欄賞鑒好風光。相約踏青郊外去。濃情蜜蜜話相莊。有的是·墨客騷人同作伴。杏花村裏共飛觴。有的是·嬬婦思夫情慘切。懶看春色臥牙床。雖然是·一種愁懷忘不掉。怎對得·擾人春夢九迴腸。所以是·春景原來無彼此。有人歡笑有凄凉。說說談談也何妨。</p>

<p>開篇「思春」</p>
<p>陌頭楊柳忽青青。獨倚闌杆黯愴　。愁鎖雙眉心欲醉。悔敎夫婿事長征。但見那，清園紅紫花如錦。蝶怨蜂狂餞好　。觸目芳菲多怨恨。寄情聊以撫瑤琴。但見那，焚香便把冰絃按。一曲彈完感動心。心切切。意愔愔。屈指歸期盼煞人。夕卜燈花朝占鵲。愁腸九轉又担驚。不知他，他鄉可有柔鄉戀。不顧糟糠去別締婚。倘若是，留戀花叢甘薄倖。無端棄舊又憐新。要問他，歸來何以慰嬌嗔。我是，近來針綫都拋却。倦倚銀床病上身。恨只恨，萬種相思拋不了。怨只怨，夢魂顛倒更傷神。幸有那，　家姊妹來相勸。且　弓鞋去踏青。記得花朝明日是。好花枝與繫金鈴。啼鳥枝頭又弄好音。</p>

<p>— 松子</p>
<p>化身姑娘</p>
<p>「化身姑娘」是著名佈景師方沛霖的第一部作品，是一部富有趣味性倫理故事的佳構。這裏是寫述一個華僑富商為了安慰他老父的渴望孫兒的心理起見，而把女兒謊說是男兒。這樣在經過十八年的長時期的隱瞞下，雖然終於被發覺是一個女兒，可是老父是那麼幸福地再經過了十八年的愉快日子了。從這個劇情上看，我們就可知道這是一部充滿了極濃厚的情感的片子。</p>
<p>除了這段感人的故事，中間更穿插了一段極幽默的羅曼史，不但使得劇情的展開更有力，尤其把戀愛的真諦儘量發揮。演員的分配，尤其是這部作品最優的一點。袁美雲在這裏飾孫女，她的確是成功了。尤其是她經過改裝後的那種英俊倜儻的態度，誰都不會再相信她就是袁美雲。王桂林飾祖父，把骨肉之愛刻骨地表現出來，以至性感人，其他如王引，周旋，許曼麗，姜修等，都有極優美的成績。</p>
<p>父子英雄</p>
<p>「父子英雄」是王次龍進藝華後第一部導演作品，一部極緊張的偵探片。主旨在解剖都市的黑幕和罪惡，描寫一部份所謂紳士聞人的無惡不作的奸險，同時，更警醒青年不可沉酒於酒色，不可受惡劣環境所左右而把一生偉大事業於一旦。王次龍在影界早已有久長的聲譽，本片更用他的桌特的手法來處理，將來公映時能給我們充分的滿意是可担保的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Hebei-Chahar Negotiations Decided to Proceed in Two Steps: First, Abolish the East Hebei Puppet Organization; Then Negotiate on Matters Regarding the War Zone <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Beiping: Tada, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, is scheduled to visit Zhangjiakou tomorrow morning, and if time permits, he will also visit Datong to see the Yungang Grottoes. Chairman Zhang Zizhong of Chahar has prepared to welcome him. Diplomatic issues between Hebei and Chahar are still under negotiation between the two sides. It is heard that the focus of the negotiations these days has been on the abolition of the East Hebei puppet organization, which is said to be no longer a problem. The second step will be to negotiate on matters regarding the war zone. Recently, there have been widespread rumors about personnel changes in North China. According to a certain authority, the personnel matters occurred two or three weeks ago and are now in the past. There have been no recent changes. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Tada, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, met with newspaper reporters at the Fusang Hall this afternoon and made a statement, saying: 1. After the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, it is now working hard to reform and seek the happiness of the people. 2. The issue of the relocation of Li Shou-xin's troops in Chahar North is being negotiated by the Kwantung Army and the Chahar Provincial Government. Since it is beyond my authority, I do not know the details. However, I can assert in the name of the commander of the garrison that the Japanese side has no aggressive intentions towards Chinese territory. Sino-Japanese amity has been deteriorating since the Russo-Japanese War. The authorities of both countries should take responsibility and not blame others without blaming themselves. The points of discord between the two countries in the past should be written off in one stroke to create a new situation and seek amity between the two countries. 3. Regarding Hebei-Chahar diplomacy, Doihara does not have a mission to represent the Kwantung Army for negotiations in Beiping. 4. Regarding the expansion of the Tianjin garrison and the implementation period, I have not yet received a definite report from the Ministry of the Army. 5. Regarding my recent impressions of North China, I believe that the anti-Japanese atmosphere has improved after the Chinese authorities abolished improper organizations, but the people are impoverished, and commerce is depressed, and they have not been able to enjoy considerable happiness. 6. Although the details of the recent student unrest in Beiping are not clear, I believe that the students are being manipulated. I sincerely hope that young students should focus on studying science as their duty. 7. I have no mission for this decision to come to Beiping. I did not go to Tongxian. When I worked in Beiping before, I went to inspect it once. I am scheduled to fly from Beiping to Zhangjiakou on the 24th, and then go to inspect Suiyuan. I will land and stay in Datong. I plan to fly back to Tianjin as soon as my work in Beiping is completed, and I do not intend to visit the Bailing Temple again. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

<p>Tianjin: It snowed on the 23rd, and the roads were blocked, making traffic in the city even more difficult. The weather was colder than in the dead of winter. The Haihe River in the Tianjin-Tanggu section was frozen solid, and inland waterways were also closed. All icebreaking work outside Dagukou was suspended, and more icebergs accumulated. The Japanese ship Nagayama Maru was trapped three kilometers outside the port. The rudder was damaged and could not turn. The icebreaker Fengtian Maru went to the rescue on the night of the 22nd and reached two kilometers from the Nagayama Maru early on the 23rd, but due to the thickness of the ice, it was unable to proceed further. Observations by the shipping industry suggest that icebreaking rescue work is hopeless. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e11">A New Posture in China's Foreign Trade <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Zi</p>
<p>At the end of last month, the Customs announced the news that the trade surplus in December of last year was more than five million yuan. Yesterday, newspapers published the news that the trade surplus in January of this year was more than one million and three hundred thousand yuan. From the perspective of China, which has been in a state of trade deficit for many years, regardless of whether the reason is a positive phenomenon affected by the new monetary policy or a negative phenomenon indicating the weakness of national purchasing power, it is an event that cannot but be noted. Since the establishment of Customs import and export trade statistics in our country, except for the record of a rare trade surplus of more than 270,000 taels of customs duties in the third year of Tongzhi (1864), the trade deficit in taels of customs duties in other years has been as high as more than 556 million (Republic of China 21) and as low as more than 16 million (Republic of China 8). This trade deficit occupies an extremely important position in China's international balance of payments. In other words, it is a major loophole in China that has been worried by those who study China's economic problems but have no way to reverse it. Now, trade surplus reports have been seen twice in a row. Although the numbers are small, from the perspective of creating a new posture in Sino-foreign trade, the relationship is quite important. Now, let's investigate it based on the facts.</p>
<p>First, the trend of China's trade deficit increased most sharply in the five years from the 17th to the 21st years of the Republic of China. In the 22nd year, the trend changed to a decline. It is estimated that the 22nd year decreased by more than 130 million yuan compared with the previous year, and the 23rd year decreased from 70 million yuan in the previous year to 50 million yuan. Last year, it decreased to more than 340 million yuan. According to this observation, even if trade surplus reports are not often seen in the coming months of this year, the amount of trade deficit must be greatly reduced compared with the past. This can be known from the trend in the past three years.</p>
<p>Second, there is one thing to note in the above-mentioned trend, that is, the annual decrease in the trade deficit is directly proportional to the decrease in the total trade volume. Many say that the reason why the total trade volume figure is low is partly due to the decline in the prices of imported and exported goods, and partly due to the decline in trade. Considering that the exports in January were more than 37 million yuan and the imports were more than 35 million yuan, each not reaching the level of 40 million yuan for monthly trade deficit during the peak trade season, it is still difficult for the Chinese to decide whether to worry or rejoice today.</p>
<p>Third, in the trade surplus phenomenon of the past two months, tung oil ranks first in exports. In the past, China's export goods were mainly soybeans, silk, tea, eggs, cotton, leather, and silk. Tung oil failed to rank among the top ten in the 20th and 21st years of the Republic of China, and only suddenly ranked fifth in the 22nd year. It is gratifying that this item has been newly added to China's export trade, but at the same time, the decrease in exports of silk and tea is also a cause for concern. This should also be paid attention to.</p>
<p>According to the above three observations, China's foreign trade has its own hopes for revitalization in the implementation of this new monetary policy. However, how to enable the large-scale export of important domestic products to meet the world's needs and benefit people's livelihoods still requires effort. Otherwise, the establishment of this new posture of trade surplus is actually gratifying but not yet gratifying.</p>

<p>Berlin: Hitler is keeping silent about what reaction Germany intends to make to the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact in the future. Hitler has now gone to his villa in the Bavarian mountains to rest. German political circles are of course very concerned about the pact, but the general public believes that Germany's decision on this matter will be entirely decided by its leader. Before the results of the French Senate's debate on the pact are known, Hitler intends to take a wait-and-see approach. If the French Senate approves it and does not make any concessions to Germany's concerns, then Hitler may take one of the following three steps: Send troops to march into the Rhineland demilitarized zone with flags flying and drums beating. Publicly announce that Germany is no longer legally bound by the demilitarization of the Rhineland, but believes that Germany's political power in the area is now sufficient to protect everything, pending a solution to the matter by international regulations. Submit a serious protest to France, reserving Germany's right to make a final decision on this matter. The first step seems unlikely to be realized, because Hitler does not want to anger world opinion as a result. Moreover, because the occupation of the Rhineland area is no longer a problem, German military experts have long been prepared inside and outside the area and can occupy and defend it within 24 hours. There is ample evidence of this. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e13">British Planning Ahead for Developments in Far East and Europe Defence Reorganisation Plan White Paper Soon to Be Tabled in Parliament <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>London: The government's white paper on the defence reorganisation plan will be tabled in the House of Commons for debate next week, when Foreign Secretary Eden will give a report on the current international situation. The diplomatic correspondent of The Observer has been speculating on the upcoming parliamentary session and what Foreign Secretary Eden may say: "Since Germany's vigorous rearmament plan has achieved great success and Japan's militaristic policy of external expansion in the Far East has been making progress day by day, the current diplomatic situation has become increasingly serious. There is no doubt that Foreign Secretary Eden will repeatedly clarify this point when explaining the necessity of the UK's defence reorganisation plan. In addition, Eden will explain that the UK also needs to reorganise its defence in order to cope with the situation in Eastern Europe. In principle, the UK has a responsibility to guarantee Austria's independence. Considering the recent visit of German Aviation Minister and Prussian Governor-General Goering to Poland and the active propaganda campaign promoted by German Envoy to Austria von Papen in Vienna (the purpose of which is to induce Yugoslavia to break away from the Little Entente and reach an understanding with Austria), it can be seen that there are many hidden dangers in Eastern Europe and the urgency of the problem is obvious."

<p>Washington: Republican Senator Borah gave a broadcast speech on Washington's Birthday today, saying that there is cunning propaganda overseas against the US neutrality policy in the Italo-Ethiopian War, and the initiator of this propaganda is actually the UK. When Japan invaded Manchuria, the UK remained neutral for its own benefit, but now, because the African war is related to its own interests, it has adopted a non-neutral policy. Although it is acting with discretion, the UK has its own considerations. However, if the UK criticises the US for adopting a neutral policy in the Italo-Ethiopian War or any other disputes in Europe, and regards it as an act of supporting war or pursuing selfish and immoral claims, then the UK or any other country should not have this right.

<h3 id="e15">Italy Hopes Countries Will Lift Sanctions Unwilling to Remain on Sidelines Regarding European Affairs No Agreement Possible Without Italian Cooperation Negotiations Impossible Without Lifting Sanctions <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Rome: Recently, there have been rumours that the Italian government intends to take advantage of the fact that the political issues of the naval conference have not yet been resolved to demand negotiations to lift sanctions as a condition for accepting future naval agreements. A semi-official spokesperson recently made a statement to the press on this issue: "Any international agreement cannot be established without Italy, and Italy can never remain on the sidelines of European affairs. This is obvious from the current situation. If countries want to ostracise Italy from the European community by means of sanctions, and then, when they need Italy's help, they demand its cooperation, especially on the issue of the Danube River Convention and the three issues of the Locarno Pact (which are Italy's responsibility). This is simply absurd." According to our correspondent, regarding the issue of the conclusion of a convention by the countries of the Danube River basin, the Italian government informally stated during the talks in Paris at the beginning of the month that any agreement without Italy's participation will never be realised. However, as long as the sanctions against Italy are in effect, Italy will not be able to hold negotiations with the countries implementing the sanctions. Later, when Foreign Minister Suvich of Italy and Austrian Foreign Minister Guido Schmidt met in Florence, Schmidt said that most of the elements of the Danube River Convention are already in place, and the conclusion can be expected. He hoped that Italy would change its negative attitude to facilitate the realisation of the convention. At that time, Suvich insisted on the above-mentioned position in response to Schmidt. As for the issue of the naval agreement, semi-official sources here believe that among the four powers participating in the naval conference, the UK is most concerned about the future naval agreement. It is willing to conclude even a partial agreement. However, it is rumoured that unless the sanctions are lifted or Italy receives at least some guarantee, it will not sign the future naval agreement and assume any obligations. However, this claim has recently been denied by semi-official sources. Regarding the issues of the Locarno Pact, semi-official sources believe that this is not a new issue at present. However, regarding the conflict between the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty and the Locarno Pact, Italy and Germany share similar views. According to our correspondent, after the German Ambassador to Italy, Hasell, met with Suvich, he rushed back to Berlin to discuss the relationship between the Franco-Soviet treaty and the Locarno Pact with the German leader, Hitler. He has now completed his mission and returned to his post. (23rd Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Rome: Rumours that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has decided to dismiss 500,000 soldiers, nearly half of the Italian army, due to the gradual improvement of the European situation have been denied here today.

<h3 id="e17">New Naval Treaty Arms Reduction Becomes Arms Expansion Opens the Door for Unlimited Shipbuilding Competition Limit on Gun Calibre a Mere Formality Fortifications in the Pacific No Longer Prohibited <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>London: If the London Naval Conference can conclude a treaty to replace the previous London and Washington treaties, its contents will be largely disappointing. The outline of the treaty, according to well-informed sources speaking to the Associated Press, is largely predictable. In short, it will open the door to unlimited naval competition. However, those who advocate the treaty will still call it a way to reduce international distrust, because Existing treaties stipulate that countries building warships must notify other countries when the keel is laid. The new treaty stipulates that notification must be given one year in advance. The new treaty will reduce the existing gun calibre limits in several clauses. The new treaty will announce a suspension of the construction of large cruisers. However, critics still believe that The new treaty does not limit the number of ships or total tonnage, leading to unlimited competition. Even the gun calibre limit is a mere formality, because it will not be effective if countries outside the treaty exceed this limit. Fortifications in the Pacific are no longer prohibited. Efforts to reduce the tonnage and power of battleships over the years have been abandoned. At the same time, observers here believe that Japan will greatly increase the construction of submarines, destroyers and small cruisers in the future. (22nd National Society Dispatch)</p>

<p>London: Regarding the issue of inviting non-participating countries to the naval conference to sign and join the future agreement, the UK originally advocated that each signatory country entrust the UK to hold talks with non-participating countries, including Germany, which was rejected by France. The experts of the two countries will formulate alternative compromises and draft a protocol to specify the conditions and deadlines for inviting non-participating countries to sign and join the agreement this autumn. This morning, the experts of the two countries held talks to discuss the wording of this naval conference protocol.

<p>London: Regarding the issue of battleship tonnage, France recently asked the US whether it could be reduced. According to sources from the French side, Norman Davis, the chief US representative to the naval conference, replied to French Chief Representative, Ambassador Corbin, this morning. However, the US delegation denied this news, saying that the US will not submit a reply to France through diplomatic channels, and it is still unknown now. Moreover, after France raised this question to the US, the delegations of the two countries held talks, at which time the US reiterated that the figure of 35,000 tons should remain unchanged.

<p>WASHINGTON - Undersecretary of the Navy Henry Roosevelt died of heart disease today. Roosevelt was a distant relative of President Roosevelt. He graduated from the Naval Academy in 1900. During the Spanish-American War, he served on the battleship "Mayflower," patrolling the coast of Cuba. In 1914, he was a naval attache at the American Embassy in Paris. After the outbreak of the European War, he was transferred back to Washington. He then left the Navy until March 1933, when he was appointed Undersecretary of the Navy.

<h3 id="e21">After the Japanese General Election, the Okada Cabinet's Position is Consolidated; The Minseito Party Decides to Fully Support the Diet; The Military Advocates Reforming the Cabinet to Cope with Extraordinary Times <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>TOKYO - The Minseito Party, which surged from 126 to 205 seats, is naturally not satisfied with the positions of Commerce Minister Machida and Education Minister Kawazaki. Therefore, it may ask Prime Minister Okada to find an opportunity to consider reforming the cabinet, which is a central issue in the future political situation and deserves attention. However, the Minseito Party executives gathered last night to exchange views on this issue. As a result, they believe that in this critical period, the whole country must unite to overcome the difficulties. As for taking advantage of the victory to reform the cabinet, such an action is unacceptable in terms of the party's credibility. They must still strive to assist Prime Minister Okada, further consolidate the situation under the control of Commerce Minister Machida, and properly manage the situation. This opinion has been unified. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>TOKYO - The military believes that the results of the general election show that the Minseito Party has become the largest party, and the proletarian parties have also made great progress. This shows that the people hope that the whole country will unite to break the current situation and seek reform in this extraordinary period. Therefore, the government must respect public opinion and decide to reform the cabinet, welcoming representatives from the Seiyukai Party and the proletarian parties, who are in opposing positions, to form a truly united cabinet to cope with the extraordinary domestic and foreign situation and move towards the implementation of national policies. Minister of the Army Kawashima will advise Prime Minister Okada based on this opinion. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>TOKYO - Regarding the results of the general election, the financial community initially believed that no matter which party, the Seiyukai or the Minseito, won, the fiscal and economic policies would not undergo drastic changes given the current situation. Therefore, they did not pay much attention. However, some people still believed that if the Seiyukai Party won, fiscal policy might undergo some changes, which caused some anxiety. Now that the election results show that the Minseito Party has won an absolute majority, the political situation can be said to be gradually stabilizing. However, the great progress of the Minseito Party also implies that the issue of cabinet reform is brewing. It is fully conceivable that the current cabinet will become Minseito-colored. However, with Finance Minister Takahashi still in office, there should be no changes in policy. The implementation of the eleventh-year budget will generally adhere to the policy of gradually reducing public debt and exercising compilation. Therefore, the financial and industrial circles can generally maintain calm. The financial community absolutely supports the maintenance of Takahashi's financial policies, and the financial community is therefore very relieved that the government has won. At this opportunity for a new division in the political arena, the financial community hopes that the government will actively implement policies to stabilize the people's livelihood and strive to adjust relations between China and Japan.

<p>TOKYO - Prime Minister Okada, who is very pleased with the unexpected victory in the general election after the dissolution of the Diet, issued his first statement after the general election, explaining the government's ambitions for the future as follows:</p>
<p>I am deeply pleased that this general election has been completed peacefully. The government's "election rectification" has generally achieved good results, which is very satisfying to the government. This is all due to the self-awareness of the entire nation. The government can only respect the will of the people expressed in this way, move forward on the path it believes in, and strive to improve international relations and expand national power. A special Diet session is planned to be convened as soon as possible. At that time, supplementary budgets and other important bills will be submitted to request the Diet's cooperation, and all government policies will be gradually implemented.

<p>TOKYO - The Seiyukai Party is currently conducting various consultations by its executives regarding the post-election measures for the problem of President Suzuki's defeat. The first issue is to see whether President Suzuki has the intention to be elected due to the resignation of Mr. Kawaguchi Yoshihisa. Regarding this point, President Suzuki's state of mind is very clear, and he will naturally have to accept the fact of his defeat. The second issue is how to handle the party's highest organization after the defeat. Currently, it is possible to consider various methods: to decide on a successor president in one go, or to set up a vice president to act on behalf of party affairs during President Suzuki's quiet contemplation, or to establish a committee system as the highest authority. These three methods are all under consultation. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>TOKYO - The financial community unanimously hopes for the continuation of Takahashi's financial policies. Regarding the reasons for the Seiyukai Party's failure in the election campaign, the financial community's view is as follows:</p>
<p>The entire nation trusts Takahashi's financial policies, but the Seiyukai Party opposes them. This is one of the reasons for the Seiyukai's defeat. In the past four years, the Seiyukai Party has had an absolute majority, but it has not only failed to make outstanding achievements, but has only been preoccupied with the Mingzheng issue and used it as a policy to appeal to the people, which excessively ignores the party's original position. This is why it failed. (Denstu dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>TOKYO - According to Japanese sources, the American official and economic circles' observation of the results of this Japanese general election is that Japan's policy towards the United States will not change in the future, because in the current situation in Japan, the rise and fall of various political parties cannot change the overall situation.

<p>MOSCOW - A certain foreign dignitary here recently expressed his opinion to our reporter, saying that the relations between Japan and Russia are no longer as tense as before. On the Russian side, in particular, they want to promote a further easing. Therefore, the proposal to withdraw a portion of the troops stationed on the Siberian border can also be considered. The railway transportation reform project in Siberia will soon be completed. At that time, Soviet troops can be transported quickly no matter where they are heading to the border. Therefore, reducing the number of troops stationed on the border does not cause any obstruction. According to reliable sources, the Mongolian troops stationed on the "Manchukuo" border have already retreated inland in order to avoid incidents. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>MOSCOW - According to our reporter's investigation, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Stomoniakov recently held talks with Japanese Ambassador to Russia Ota (Ota held consultations with Foreign Minister Litvinov on the 15th and 16th of this month). The discussion focused on the organization of a Russian-"Manchu"-Japanese tripartite committee to handle the recent Russian-"Manchu" border affairs. The Soviet side originally advocated the appointment of commissioners of other nationalities to participate in the matter. It is now heard that this claim has been abandoned, and it has been agreed with Japan that the duty of the commission is limited to investigating the conflict in the Krotekov area on January 30. The investigation results may only be reported to the governments of Russia, "Manchu," and Japan and have no right to judge right or wrong. The number of commissioners dispatched by the three parties is equal, and all will be filled by military officers, who will be appointed from the troops that did not participate in the Krotekov area conflict. However, the number of commissioners and the date of the meeting have not yet been decided because Japan still has to wait for the Soviet Union to submit a reply. Insiders here believe that the establishment of this commission is experimental in nature. Once successful, Japan and Russia may establish several more joint committees to handle various outstanding issues between Russia, "Manchu," and Japan. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>MOSCOW - Ambassador Ota visited Deputy Foreign Minister Stomoniakov at the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs on the afternoon of the 21st. As a result of the consultation on the establishment of an investigation committee for the Jinchanggou incident, the participation of commissioners from third countries was excluded. The mixed commissioners were composed only of representatives from Japan, "Manchu," and the Soviet Union to conduct on-site investigations. The two sides agreed on this opinion. Although the details of the organization, the number of commissioners, and the schedule of meetings have not yet been decided, the number of commissioners from Japan, "Manchu," and the Soviet Union are equal, and military personnel other than those involved in the case will be appointed as commissioners to report the situation of the investigation to the three governments separately for final consultations. (Domei dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>TOKYO - Regarding the establishment of a joint investigation committee to handle the Jinjanggou incident, Ambassador Ota held talks with the Soviet Foreign Ministry on the 21st. The contents of the talks were telegraphed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 23rd. It is said that the committee did not recognize the participation of third-country nationals, and it was composed of commissioners from Japan, "Manchu," and the Soviet Union with an equal number of commissioners from each side. The two sides agreed. In the near future, they will hold further consultations to decide on the details of the investigation of the dispute. The determination of the number of commissioners and their qualifications must also await negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union. It seems that each side will send three commissioners, but it still needs to be agreed upon between Japan and "Manchu." The Japanese side advocates that the Deputy Consul in Suifenhe, Chuzin, and the Kwantung Army and "Manchukuo" each select one commissioner. As for the parties involved in the dispute between Japan, "Manchu," and the Soviet Union, they will participate as referents. In addition, a similar fact-finding committee must also be established on the Manchurian-Mongolian border, but there is no report on the points raised by the Soviet side.

<p>— By Lonis Fisher, Translated by Bin Fu</p>
<p>Yesterday I came from the snowy Alps to the temperate climate of Lombardy. Today I strolled around the streets for a long time. Every shop used the colors of the national flag, green, white, and red, to display signs that said "This shop only sells Italian goods." There was also a kind of sign that advised people to only buy Italian goods or products from non-sanctioning countries. A pharmacy announced that "Patriotic Italians only buy Italian medicine." A coffee shop warned drinkers to "Only drink Italian wine." Some of the slogans also quoted fragments from Mussolini's speeches. If the sanctions were strictly enforced, this kind of patriotic voluntary action would probably be endless. This anti-sanction propaganda is meant to incite a deep hatred of foreigners among the people and concentrate them under the Fascist group.</p>
<p>Books about East Africa, Abyssinia, and black races are piled up in bookstores. In the window of every bookstore, there is a special display of the book "Britain's Conquest in Africa" by Karevanli, because the Italians often repeatedly retort: "Britain itself has looted so much in Africa, what right does she have to interfere with our conquest of Abyssinia?" Of course, she has no right to interfere; but morality is inherently unimportant in imperialist policy.</p>
<p>The glass window of a stationery store was covered with postcards and pictures. One of the postcards for sale showed an Italian officer in tropical uniform. He faced a group of Abyssinian chiefs, some kneeling before him, and some standing upright giving him the Roman salute. Below this was the notation in brackets: "Enemies." Behind him, a hand holding a long sword was about to slash him in the back. The long sword was labeled with the word "Sanctions." Below this was also a small note in brackets: "Our friends." I also saw in many places a postcard depicting an armed Italian soldier trampling on a map of Abyssinia. He held a torch in his hand, burning in the three colors of green, white, and red. On this colored flame was written the Italian word Civilita (Civilization).</p>
<p>"Give gold and iron to the motherland." On a certain street, I saw a freight truck parked in front of a coffee and tea shop. The crowd watched as a brown-shirted man stuffed empty coffee cans onto the truck. The truck box was already full of scrap iron and broken tin. A magazine sold at a newsstand had a cartoon print on it, showing a ship carrying gold about to leave the port. This was "The Escape of Gold from France." Behind this picture was another picture showing Italians throwing earrings, rings, gold watches, and similar things into the furnace. This was "The Golden Gifts Received by Italy."</p>
<p>Photographs of Mussolini are everywhere - Mussolini is angry, frowning, pouting, smiling; Mussolini is drawing his sword, shooting, swimming, pacing and speaking, playing the piano; Mussolini is on a cannon, on a tank, on a horse, on a platform; Mussolini is simple, wearing a Roman crown, a steel helmet, a Fascist cap; Mussolini, Mussolini. He has a dramatic flair that Italians love. His eyes flash with a fanatical ferocity. His heavy, protruding jaw shows strength and will; his contracted lips tell of a world-shocking ambition.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wandered into the poorer areas of Milan, and I couldn't help but think of my childhood. Because the smell I smelled here was the same as the smell in the Italian area of ​​South Philadelphia where I grew up. I remember that my Italian playmates were bold, noisy, and brave. Our young "gang" often pushed coal trains, and everyone threw coal at each other. But Italian children are not the best soldiers.</p>
<p>In a more remote part of Milan, I saw some old announcements from the Milan Provincial Government, which said in essence that "In order to support the central government's grand event," a cash prize of 300 names was specially set up, each with 500 lire (Lire is the name of Italian currency) to mothers who can raise three children between October 28, 1931 and October 28, 1936. The notice stated that priority was given to poorer families. I assert that no one will want to participate in this competition. Having to have three children in five years! The Fascist Party just wanted to use this as an excuse to say that overpopulation made Abyssinia necessary for them. At the same time, they are doing their best to exaggerate the problem of overpopulation. The daily newspaper publishes official statistics every day. According to today's evening paper, the number of births in Milan last month was 1,197; deaths 967; marriages 627. An Italian propaganda publication once said, "The status of women under Fascist rule is actually the center of the family." But she "must have fulfilled her sacred mission, ... she must be a mother" - especially if she can encourage her sons to become soldiers.</p>
<p>Today is Sunday, and I ran to the magnificent marble chapel. Here are two thousand marble statues, some located on very high minarets; here are carved glass windows; here are beautiful and solemn ceremonies and singing. In the square outside, the black-shirted band played patriotic hymns. One or two people in the crowd applauded each verse.</p>
<p>I wandered into a precious showroom. A huge map of Abyssinia made of transparent material hung on the wall. Behind it, in the space from Addis Ababa to the Sudanese border, was embedded Mussolini's helmeted head, flickering brightly and dimly. Nearby, a mechanical bee was sucking nectar from a flower in a very orderly manner.</p>
<p>On the avenues, side streets, and on the walls of all the buildings, every gap was filled with slogans. "Mussolini", "Long live Duce", "Long live the Conqueror of Adowa", "Long live the Fascist Revolution, Long live the Glorious Army of East Africa, Long live My Emperor," this also long live, that also long live. Everywhere again were brown posters of Mussolini's helmeted head. I noticed that many of the slogans had been torn. Some were torn off a corner or a strip with fingers. Some were cut a hole in the center with a sharp weapon. This made me very interested. I walked street after street. Many of the slogans on the central streets were only torn. Some of the slogans on the remote streets were simply torn off completely. I looked at the advertising posters, but they were rarely torn off, and most of them were still intact. I hired a car to go to the suburbs, and then strolled back slowly. If this phenomenon of tearing slogans has political significance, I can be sure of my observations. There is no doubt about it: with very few exceptions, the Fascist slogans were torn off by the hands of planned saboteurs. There are fewer slogans in the suburbs of Milan than in the city, but occasionally a few have been torn off.</p>

<p>MADRID - As a result of the amnesty law passed by the National Assembly last night, a total of 30,000 political prisoners were able to enjoy freedom again this morning. In front of the capital's prison, crowds of people, women, and children gathered to welcome the released prisoners. When the released prisoners walked out of the prison, the crowds shouted and rejoiced, parading in celebration of peace and prosperity. As the crowd walked, they sang new revolutionary songs to boost their momentum. Fortunately, the order was not greatly disturbed. However, when amnesty prisoners were released in the provinces, the order was not as stable as in the capital. The crowds gathered in front of the prison in the Oviedo Province were impatient and tense. The authorities released the political prisoners who mutinied in October last year before receiving the amnesty order. The same thing was found in other provinces as well. (National News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>MADRID - The 30,000 political prisoners of the Socialist Party cannot be released from prison immediately because the constitutional procedures have not been completed. It must be extended until today and tomorrow before they can be released from prison. Although the people are agitated by this matter, the order in the capital and the provinces is still well maintained. The right-wing refugees fleeing to France are still coming in an endless stream. Mr. Chabapoli, who once held the post of prime minister, is also among them. Refugees are only allowed to carry a maximum of £140 in money. According to the refugees, the people of Osturia have a very strong hatred for the right-wing party, because the Socialist Party had an unsuccessful uprising in the area in 1934, and the treatment they received at that time was very cruel.

<p>PARIS - The government recently tested a new engine on a train from Paris to Chartres. The engine uses charcoal as fuel. The results of the test were excellent. The speed was 190 kilometers per hour, and the cost of fuel was only 0.14 francs per horsepower per hour. This test has a close relationship with the problem of liquid fuel substitutes currently being studied by the "French Scientific Research Institute." After this test, it proves that charcoal engines are fully capable of being used in the transportation industry. The government attaches great importance to this new invention. This is enough to be seen by the personal participation of the Minister of Agriculture, the Minister of Public Works, and the authorities of the National Defense Agency in the test drive. It is natural that the Public Works Department attaches importance to this matter. The Ministry of Agriculture is also concerned about it, because this new invention can give an important sales channel for domestic timber. The National Defense Agency also pays attention to it, because once this method is popularized, countries that lack oil will not be restricted by foreign oil imports. Although the use of charcoal as fuel for engines is not new, this is the first time it has been used in trains. Last autumn, the government tested charcoal cars in Landes (a famous wood-producing area in the south). The speed was very low, which is far different from the 190 kilometers per hour of trains. This shows that this new invention has made progress. In addition, because the train engine is larger in size, it stores more charcoal than cars. As a result, the locomotive can complete a longer route without adding fuel in the middle. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3 id="e71">Geography Lecture: Why Do We Study Foreign Geography? <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Guozhang, Head of the Geography Department, Central University</p>
<p>Whether in junior high school or high school, foreign geography is a required course. I think everyone must have a question in their minds, which is, why do we study foreign geography? The answer to this question is, of course, different for everyone, but in my personal opinion, there are three main reasons why we need to study foreign geography:</p>
<p>First, to understand the interrelationships between nations.</p>
<p>Second, to understand China's position in the international arena.</p>
<p>Third, to serve as a model for improving national welfare and people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, studying foreign geography can help us understand the interrelationships between nations. Now, I will first discuss several basic elements of international relations and their relationship with geography, and then give a few examples to illustrate that a country's external relations all have their own special geographical background.</p>
<p>The world today is like an organism, with each part having a mutually interconnected effect. No part is unaffected by the outside, and no part cannot affect the outside. The saying "pull one hair and move the whole body" is enough to show the depth of current international relations. Standing in the world today, it is not only those in power who need to have a deep understanding of the interrelationships between nations and the major issues between nations, but also the general public should have a preliminary understanding of the international situation in order to serve as a backing for the country's diplomatic negotiations. Only in this way can so-called citizen diplomacy be realized one day.</p>
<p>The current international situation has reached an extremely serious and complex point. Many countries feel that political problems are difficult to solve; many countries feel that society is unstable; the majority of countries are suffering from economic panic and cannot live in peace; and many countries are being invaded by international capital imperialism and are in dire straits, unable to find a way out in politics, economics, and society. The interests of each country and the serious problems they face are different, which makes the interrelationships between nations even more complicated.</p>
<p>Although the interrelationships between nations are complex, the formation of this complex international relationship has five basic elements. If we want to have a reasonable understanding of this complex international relationship, we must start with these five basic elements that make up international relations. Now, I will simply explain them one by one:</p>
<p>Exclusive ownership of land and natural resources — Almost everywhere on the earth, except for the newly discovered areas of Antarctica, is managed by a country, and most of the land and natural resources are privately owned. If a country wants to expand its territory or add to its natural resources, it simply has no other opportunity than to infringe upon the land and natural resources owned by other countries. Places that were originally not very relevant are also connected for this reason.</p>
<p>Rapid population growth and uneven distribution — Before the 18th century, the world had only 400 to 500 million people, equivalent to China's current population. According to the latest statistics, the total world population has reached about 2 billion. The number of people added in a short period of two or three hundred years has exceeded four or five times the number of people added since humans first existed, which is truly a miracle in the history of human population growth. The rapid increase in population in recent centuries is due to the development of modern science, which has increased human production capacity and increased the average lifespan. However, there is no limit to population growth, while the area of land and natural resources in the world are finite, and the increase in productivity also has a certain limit. Therefore, the major countries of the world are almost universally suffering from the panic of overpopulation and are eagerly trying to occupy places with relatively sparse populations in order to make plans for emigration abroad, or to forcibly seize the resources of weak countries in order to increase the living resources of their own populations. The international disputes caused by this are countless.</p>
<p>The world's population is not only increasing rapidly, but also very unevenly distributed. Many places have less than two people per square mile, while many places have more than a thousand people per square mile. Southeast Asia, Northwestern Europe, and the northeastern part of the United States are all extremely densely populated areas in the world, with an average of more than 200 people per square mile. In these places, the competition for human survival is extremely intense. Some rely entirely on good weather and abundant harvests to barely make a living each year, while others rely entirely on peace and tranquility, with no wars, and raw materials and manufactured goods can be transported and circulated everywhere to barely survive. If the weather is bad, the harvest is poor, or international trade declines for some reason, many people will feel the danger of hunger and cold, and the whole world will feel uneasy.</p>
<p>Uneven distribution of natural resources — Mineral resources are the foundation of modern new-style industries, but the distribution of mineral resources is very uneven among the countries of the world. For example, for coal needed to develop heavy industry, four-fifths are produced in the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom; for the iron needed, three-quarters are produced in the United States, France, and the United Kingdom; for petroleum, more than nine-tenths are produced in the United States, Mexico, and Russia; three-quarters of the copper are produced in the United States, Chile, and Japan; and three-quarters of the gold are produced in South Africa, the United States, and Canada. In addition, other mineral resources are also concentrated in a small number of countries. The uneven distribution of mineral production and the level of utilization of natural resources and the amount of production costs in each country are, of course, very important, but the biggest reason is the uneven distribution of mineral deposits themselves. Some places have a lot, some places have little, and mineral deposits are formed naturally, which cannot be changed by human power. Less is less, more is more, and people can do nothing about it. Moreover, mineral resources are natural wealth created over many past eras, and one ton is used up, so one ton is gone. It is absolutely impossible to remedy this. However, the need for various mineral resources is not limited to one country or one place, and at the same time, the minerals produced in one country or one place may not be completely consumed by that country or that place. Under these circumstances, the only solution is for various places to help each other, transporting their surplus to other places and importing what is lacking from other places. In this way, the interdependent relationship between the countries of the world is deeper, and international problems become more complex. This is only in terms of mineral resources; other agricultural products, manufactured goods, etc., are also subject to local restrictions and require cooperation between various regions. In other words, they can all promote the closer relationship between nations.</p>
<p>Improvement of transportation — The progress of modern science has made human transportation methods more and more ingenious day by day, and the distance on the earth is shortening day by day. In the past, people sighed at the ocean, but now they can travel around the world by steamship. Railways and highways can climb mountains and cross ridges, and airplanes and airships can even fly over the high sky. Land cables and submarine cables are densely distributed on the earth, and radio can use the ether in the air to communicate information between various places. The so-called "the ends of the earth are like neighboring villages" is really not an exaggeration from today's perspective. The exchange of ideas or goods everywhere in the world is very convenient, and the relationship between nations is becoming closer.</p>
<p>Due to the improvement of transportation and the convenience of transportation, the sources of materials needed for our daily lives have expanded even more, and the development of international trade has seen a rapid increase. Just think about the food, clothing, and things we use at home, and how many of them are transported from foreign countries. China is known as an agricultural country, but it is not self-sufficient in food and needs to import large quantities of rice from Annam, Siam, and other places every year. Clothing materials are also insufficient and need to import large quantities of cotton from India and large quantities of cotton cloth from Japan. The steel machinery needed for construction projects and the gasoline and vehicles needed for highways are mostly imported from foreign countries. As for daily utensils, the number of items imported from foreign countries is countless. If the cotton harvest in India is poor, the price of cotton in Shanghai and Osaka will rise, and the price of cotton yarn and cotton cloth will increase, and our clothing will become more expensive. If Annam and Siam experience unexpected floods or droughts, the price of rice in Shanghai will rise. This is only in terms of China; the situation in other countries is even more extreme. Due to the relationship of international trade, the whole world can be said to have become a whole economic unit.</p>
<p>The impact of the Industrial Revolution — Since the United Kingdom first raised the banner of the Industrial Revolution at the end of the 18th century, countries around the world have been affected by it one after another, using the power of machinery and underground coal and iron to promote the development of human industrial life, engaging in mass production, and wanting to find a new way out for human survival from industry. The biggest result of the Industrial Revolution is, on the one hand, the massive increase in manufactured goods, and on the other hand, the massive increase in the consumption of raw materials and fuels. The massive amount of manufactured goods cannot be consumed by one country or one place, and the massive amount of raw materials and fuels cannot be supplied by one country or one place. It is necessary to find markets for manufactured goods and supply bases for raw materials and fuels elsewhere. Imperialism has risen from this point, international trade has developed from this point, and the interrelationships between nations have become even more complex.</p>
<p>The above are the five basic elements that make up the current complex international relationship. If you want to have a reasonable understanding of international relations, you must start with these basic elements. But if you want to have a reasonable understanding of these basic elements, you must first have a reasonable knowledge of foreign geography. Which of the so-called distribution of the world's population and the living conditions of the people, the distribution of natural resources, the distribution of transportation routes, and the situation of commodity transactions in various places is not a matter of geography? Therefore, the occurrence of every international problem has a profound geographical background. Geographical knowledge can be said to be the key to solving international problems. This is the first purpose of why we need to learn foreign geography. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Jin Dui</p>
<p>12. The Yunting Canal and Resettlement Measures in Ningxia</p>
<p>Ningxia's water conservancy is the most famous in China. The network of canals is intricate, as described in previous articles. However, within the borders of Ningxia and Lingwu, there are still fields that cannot be irrigated by the existing canals. In particular, the western bank of the Yellow River near Ningxia County is a vast, flat expanse of fertile land, yet the population is sparse, with few villages. This abundant source of wealth has become a desolate wasteland. To alleviate the irrigation difficulties of the former and to develop the barren land of the latter, the provincial authorities should select a site between Ningxia and Lingwu counties to build a new canal; this is both a plan and a necessity.</p>
<p>This planned canal project has indeed been implemented. Because it is entirely built by military engineers, the construction costs are very low. From the winter of the 23rd year to the spring of last year, the project continued, being interrupted or progressing depending on the weather. Finally, on May 11th of the 24th year, the Yunting Canal held its water opening ceremony.</p>
<p>The construction of this canal, including the dikes and bridges along the way, allocated over 120,000 yuan. The canal is about 120 li long and irrigates an area of about 600,000 mu. It is named "Yunting Canal" in memory of General Ma Fuqun (zi Yunting), former chairman of the enemy suppression.</p>
<p>Although the canal is complete, many fields in the irrigated area remain barren. If no measures are taken to cultivate them, the benefits of repairing and constructing the canal will not be significant. Therefore, after the completion of the canal, a resettlement plan is needed. It is said that the construction costs of the canal were over 120,000 yuan, with a surplus of 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. The provincial authorities plan to use the remaining funds from the canal project, plus the registration fees collected during the land survey, totaling about 200,000 yuan, as resettlement expenses. The plan is to first resettle 400 to 500 households to establish three new villages and cultivate the barren land on both sides of the canal. The origin of the resettled people, whether from within or outside the province, is not restricted. In the future, as cultivation develops, local construction will be undertaken. Adding 500,000 to 600,000 mu of land out of nowhere and increasing the population will ensure that the fruits of the canal's benefits are abundant.</p>
<p>In the 24th year administrative plan of the Ningxia Provincial Government, under the "Cultivation" section of construction projects, there is a "Yunting Canal Area Reclamation Method."</p>
<p>"After the opening of the newly built Yunting Canal in Ningxia, tens of thousands of mu of land can be irrigated. It is planned to establish a Yunting Canal Area Reclamation Preparation Office to implement military-civilian reclamation. The methods are as follows: (A) The Reclamation Preparation Office will be composed of the staff office and adjutant of the 15th Route Army Headquarters, one specialist in cultivation, one section chief from the Construction Department, and one officer in charge of the reclamation troops. The matters to be handled are as follows: surveying and mapping the reclamation area; examining the geology of the reclamation area; designing and constructing residential areas, fortresses, dikes, bridges, roads, and dredging ditches; implementing land leveling and regional division; allocating residential areas, cultivated mu, farm tools, livestock, seeds, fertilizers, etc.; handling immigration matters. (B) Measure tens of thousands of mu of land as a reclamation area for a regiment. A regiment of officers and soldiers has 500 people, with 20 mu of land per person, totaling 30,000 mu of land. In addition, building houses, repairing canals, and building roads total 30,050 mu. The regiment's special service company, heavy artillery company, and three battalions, each with four companies, are four units. Each company has nine squads, with ten to twelve people per squad. One squad cultivates 200 mu of land, one company cultivates 2,000 mu of land, and four companies cultivate 8,000 mu of land, allocated in four corners. The middle is the battalion, and the middle of that is the regiment, entirely a military organization. The larger unit is based on the regiment, and the smaller unit is based on the squad. One squad lives in a fortress. The military organization is applied to the administrative organization, and the military and civilians are integrated, implementing the baojia system. One squad cultivates 200 mu of land, equivalent to the land cultivated by one jia of people. Nine squads are equal to one bao. Four bao are equal to one lianbao. Four lianbao are equal to one district, just as four battalions are equal to one regiment, which can house 1,500 households. All supplies and houses are made by the military. The vehicles and livestock are purchased by the government and will be repaid with the produce in the future. The production distribution method is public military production and public distribution. For 200 mu of land, 100 mu are planted with rice, and 100 mu are planted with wheat. After the wheat and rice are harvested, they are stored together in public warehouses. In addition to each family's consumption, the public uses the equipment, which is paid off in installments. The surplus is distributed according to diligence and laziness. All barren land will be cultivated by the military and then handed over to the people for cultivation."</p>
<p>The following is "Measures for Recruiting Immigrants." Recorded below: "Ningxia is located in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, at the strategic point of the Northwest. The land is fertile, and the water conservancy is convenient. Only the population is sparse, and the land is desolate. The border area feels empty, and the land advantage is not fully utilized. However, the southeastern provinces are narrow and densely populated, with no land to cultivate. The supply is often disrupted, and food shortages often cause panic. Now, to adjust the population, increase production, develop the land, a specific the Yunting Canal, Hezhongbao, Zhensupao, Ligangbao, Zima Beach, Guangwu, Yao Fubao and other places as resettlement areas, stipulating preferential measures for farmers, the connotations are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Immigration procedures. All those who wish to immigrate to this province, whether as individuals or legal entities, shall obtain a license from their respective provincial or county government to prove their identity, and the issuing authority shall first notify the total number of men and women in the household, the date of departure, and the route to the provincial reclamation bureau for preparation. The selection of farmers, regardless of refugees, disaster victims, or farmers voluntarily immigrating, shall be qualified by good character, diligence, and hard work. It is especially appropriate for those who bring their families with them.</p>
<p>(B) Reception methods. Reclamation reception offices will be set up on the main roads to and from the border of this province. After farmers enter the territory of this province, they shall report with the certificate or license they carry in order to receive them. The addresses of the temporary reception offices are Guangxingyuan in Dengkou County, Zibao in Zhongning County, and Huianbao in Yanchi County.</p>
<p>(C) Placement measures. This government will set up reclamation sub-bureaus in designated reclamation areas, select suitable locations, and build a number of new villages. The village office will review the farmers' occupations, allocate residences, and allocate barren land according to the number of farmers. Each adult male will be granted 20 mu of land, and the elderly, young, and women will be granted half the amount."</p>
<p>"Reclamation Bureau Recruiting Farmers Announcement," is also a reference for concerning the actual situation in the Northwest and development research, a copy is attached, to inform the nation, the original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"This province is located in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, with vertical and horizontal canals, fertile soil, and unique water conservancy. Moreover, there is no drought or flood, with annual planting and harvesting, and abundant agricultural products. Rice and wheat are suitable. The saying that the Yellow River in the world enriches Ningxia is not a false statement. Now, bandits have disappeared, security is not a concern, transportation is convenient, and the lanes and gates are prosperous. Only the land is vast and sparsely populated, and the wilderness is everywhere. The benefits are abandoned on the land, which is deeply regrettable. When strong neighbors are watching around, border defense is awaiting firm, farmers are displaced, and the population still needs adjustment. In order to increase the area of production, develop national industries, solve the population, and consolidate national defense, we have obtained approval from the central government to designate this province as a reclamation experiment area and further task this bureau with actively organizing it. In addition to soliciting farmers, we are now extracting the main points and listing them in the following order. All my fellow farmers, come quickly, do not miss the opportunity, this announcement,</p>
<p>All farmers of the Republic of China nationality who come with their families and hold certificates from the local government are welcome. However, the methods of immigration groups organized by the government and entrepreneurs will be discussed and determined.</p>
<p>This bureau has reception offices in various counties on the border, and will do its best to receive farmers.</p>
<p>Each adult male will be granted 20 mu of land, and the elderly, young, and women will be granted half the amount. After three years, the tax will be increased.</p>
<p>Building, livestock, seeds, farmers, and living expenses will be lent by this bureau without interest and repaid in installments.</p>

<p>Remnant Bandits on the Border of Henan Hubei and Anhui Provinces Are Being Suppressed by Wei Lihuang</p>
<p>Gao’s Bandits Are Still Weak, The Main Force Still Remains in Huangmei</p>
<p>Nine Counties in Eastern Hubei Comply With Orders to Complete Self-Defense Liaison</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: While the remaining bandits of He Xiao failed to disturb western Hubei, the Gao Junting gang disturbed eastern Hubei, southern Henan, and western Anhui. The nine counties of Huangmei, Huang'an, Huanggang Qichun, Xishui Yong, Luotian, Guangji, and Yingshan were the first to be affected and were ravaged. Huangmei, Luotian, and Qichun suffered the most. At that time, Liang Guanying's troops were responsible for chasing and suppressing the bandits, but because the bandits appeared and disappeared unpredictably, they were almost exhausted. Now, the main force of the bandits is still in Huangmei. Except for the urban area, important areas such as Dahepu, Tingqianyi, Dushan Town, and Konglong Town were once captured by them. Many stores were plundered. Chen Lei, the garrison commander of Jiujiang, received the county's police report and immediately sent the 36th Independent Brigade to suppress them. The area gradually became secure. Chairman Chiang repeatedly based the province's military often on grain reports from the bureau and requests from the people, deeply concerned that the remnant bandits would be revived. He specifically appointed Wei Lihuang as the commander-in-chief of the bandit suppression in the border area of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, responsible for supervising the suppression. After receiving the order, Wei arrived in Hankou the day before yesterday and discussed the suppression methods with Pacification Director He Chengyu, Provincial Chairman Yang Yongtai, and others. On the 21st, Wei braved the rain and took a plane to Beijing to see Chiang and ask for instructions. Within a few days, he would inspect the suppression in person. When Wei served as the bandit suppression commander on the border of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui two years ago, he was invincible and his prestige spread far and wide. The bandit suppression in Jinzhai was recovered by the force of his troops. Jun was changed to Lihuang County to commemorate the battle exploits. This time, he was given the important task again, and the strength of the bandits is far less than before. The prospects for bandit suppression are quite optimistic. At the same time, Provincial Chairman Yang Yongtai also ordered the nine counties in eastern Hubei to complete self-defense liaison and effectively maintain public order. The local Zhuang Ding teams have also been established one after another to cooperate with the military in suppressing the bandits. It is estimated that the period of purification will not be far away. (21st)</p>
<p>Liu Zhenhua Inspects the Dikes in Anhui Province, The Construction Length Is Over 600 Kilometers, Chuan Ruling Also Inspects Various Dike Projects</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The good dikes along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province are Wangjiang, Susong, Huaining, Tongcheng, Wuwei, and Hexian on the north bank of the river, and Dangtu, Wuhu, Fanchang, Tongling, Guichi, and Dongliu on the south bank of the river, with a total length of over 1,000 kilometers. In recent years, they have suffered from floods many times. Each time, the dike body was not strong, and it was overflowing and collapsed, resulting in a major disaster, leading to rural bankruptcy and people fleeing. In view of this, the provincial government has specifically designated the regulation of water conservancy as the central work of this year. For inner counties, northern Anhui focuses on river channels, and southern Anhui focuses on ponds and dikes. Water conservancy supervisors are assigned to each administrative supervisory area, so as to be specifically responsible. After precise measurements of the river dikes, such as Laozhoutou, Biyang River, Mahua Dike, Guangji Dike, Yongle, Huangsitan, Mapu, and Baoda, the length of those that should be constructed and repaired reaches 644 kilometers. It is estimated that 7,326,920 cubic meters of earthwork are needed, and about 3,663,400 man-days are required. The project funds have been subsidized by the central government with 500,000 yuan of disaster relief public bonds. Other labor service and construction labor, and the county's requisition, have also obtained great assistance. Provincial Chairman Liu Zhenhua, in addition to ordering the county magistrates to assist in the work, also accompanied Construction Department Director Liu Yiyan and Construction Department Water Conservancy Section Director Wen Yi, on the 21st, took the Anfeng Chariot from Anqing, and inspected the dike project along the river. That night, they passed Wuhu and went straight down to Caishi to stay overnight. At 5 p.m. on the 22nd, they returned to Yan. Liu will inspect the upstream of Anqing, he is eager to travel as a relative, did not land, and immediately took the original transport back. Liu Yiyan and Wen Yi landed in Wuhu, because Fu Ruling, Chairman of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Committee, also scheduled to depart from Beijing on the 23rd by survey ship, to inspect the entire Yangtze River dikes. Liu Yiyan intends to meet Fu and then accompany him to inspect the dike projects in Anhui Province. When Liu Zhenhua arrived in Wuhu, he announced the results of the inspection, that Wuwei and Huaining counties started construction earlier, and the dikes in these two counties were more important. All counties were ordered to start work on the same day and complete the work before the end of April, so as not to delay the busy farming season or prevent work from being harmed by the arrival of spring floods (22nd)</p>
<p>Last Year's Overseas Chinese Remittances to Xiamen Were Calculated To Be Over 11.6 Million, Which Was Only Enough To Offset Last Year's Import Surplus in Xiamen</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Overseas Chinese in various British, Dutch, American, and French territories in Southeast Asia are mostly from southern Fujian, so Xiamen port also accounts for the highest percentage of overseas Chinese remittances to China. The rise and fall of the economy in southern Fujian and the prosperity and decline of trade in Xiamen depend on this. Southern Fujian produces very little. It has been open to trade for 70 years and is an example of import surpluses. The most prosperous period was in the 18th and 19th years of the Republic of China, when imports reached 29 million to 30 million customs taels and exports were only 4 million taels. This huge import surplus also relied on overseas Chinese remittances to make up for it. In addition to making up for this import surplus, overseas Chinese remittances are also capital for purchasing property in their home country. The most prosperous period was when annual remittances reached 40 million to 50 million taels. After the 18th year of the Republic of China, the world economic panic affected Southeast Asia, and industries shrank. Fortunately, gold prices rose and exchange rates were extremely high. Overseas Chinese remitted funds back to Xiamen from the 19th to the 21st year of the Republic of China. However, there have been years of banditry in southern Fujian, the troops are everywhere, and they dare not invest in the interior. At that time, Xiamen opened up a new market, and housing prices rose, so they invested in Xiamen real estate. According to the Chamber of Commerce, the total amount of overseas Chinese capital invested in Xiamen real estate reached 80 million yuan. After the 21st year of the Republic of China, real estate values plummeted. The price of one land was 240,000 yuan, but now it is only 40,000 yuan, and no one cares. This fund has become stagnant in real estate. After the 22nd year, remittances have been greatly reduced. There were still 20 million yuan in the previous year. Last year (the 24th year), according to the Xiamen Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, which was released the day before yesterday, after two months of time, all Chinese and foreign banks, remittance bureaus, and folk post offices were investigated to obtain the exact number, totaling only 11,636,925 yuan. At the same time, customs statistics show that last year's trade surplus in Xiamen was 11,014,000 yuan (exports were 3,677,000 yuan), which was only enough to make up for the import surplus. However, the shrinkage of imports is less than one-third of that in the 18th and 19th years of the Republic of China. The speed of the decline in purchasing power is shocking. It can also be inferred that both southern Fujian and overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have fallen into a deep abyss of depression (February 19)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Zhejiang Province Plans to Implement Cuttlefish Fishing Ban <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence: The dispute between net fishing and cage fishing of cuttlefish is an important issue in the fishing disputes between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Zhejiang Jian intends to thoroughly resolve the situation. The Provincial Fisheries Experiment Field has studied the advantages and disadvantages of net fishing and the artificial culture of cuttlefish. The field has drafted fishing ban periods and measures, and submitted a request for implementation. The measures and explanations are summarized below: (Explanation of the principles and methods of cuttlefish fishing ban period and banning the scraping and drying of fishing cages)</p>
<p>"It has been found that the peak spawning period for cuttlefish is between May 15th and 16th. Before and after this time, although cuttlefish come to swim near the sea for reproduction, the number is very small and unimportant. The incubation situation of cuttlefish has been studied and the results show that eggs produced in May or early June require more than 30 days to hatch due to the low water temperature (about 17 to 20 degrees Celsius). Eggs produced after early June require 26 to 30 days to hatch due to the higher water temperature (about 19 to 22 degrees Celsius). It can be seen that the incubation of cuttlefish eggs is most common after June 16th until July 20th. This period can also be called the main period of fish egg incubation, and the fish eggs attached to the fish cage are most easily shaken off or damaged by the friction between the cage and the side of the boat, so that the fish eggs can be naturally incubated, so it is stipulated that after the fishing ban period, cage fishing is not only harmless, but also can help the reproduction of cuttlefish.</p>
<p>According to the field's experiments and investigations in the 24th year, it was found that the incubation of cuttlefish eggs is most common from late June to mid-July. If the fishing ban period is stipulated to be from June 20th to July 20th every year, cuttlefish will have a great opportunity to reproduce in large quantities, and there will be no great obstacle to fishing. At this time, it is near the end of the fishing season, and the fish are thin and weak after reproduction, and the quality is also poor, so prohibiting fishing will not affect the livelihood of fishermen.</p>
<p>It has also been found that there are four aspects of cage fishing and other fishing operations that harm the reproduction of cuttlefish and should be banned: Patting cages. Fishermen dislike that the fish cages have too many fish eggs attached to them. Every time they pick up the cage, they first take out the cuttlefish, and then pat the outside of the cage to make the fish eggs fall off and sink into the sea. This kind of treatment is enough to make the fish eggs have no chance to develop and should be banned. Sunning cages. During the fishing season, the fish cages have too many fish eggs attached to them, which hinders the effectiveness of fishing. Fishermen will carry the cages to the land and expose them to the hot sun, so that the fish eggs dry up and fall off, and then carry them back to the fishing grounds for use. Although this kind of behavior can give fishermen a temporary benefit, it is extremely harmful to the reproduction of cuttlefish and should also be banned. Burning cages. After the fishing season, the bamboo cages are heavy due to the fish eggs attached to them, and they are moldy and unbearable after being used for a long time. Fishermen often raise the cages, put them on the land, dry them, and use them as fuel. This action is of very little benefit to the fishermen, but it greatly hinders the development of fish eggs and should also be banned. Net fishing for juveniles. The current sea bream nets and large fishing nets used in the Zhoushan, Zhongjie Mountain, and Maanshan Islands are not intended to catch small cuttlefish, but because their mesh size is too small and the period of use is when the small cuttlefish have just hatched from the fish eggs and are drifting in the sea, therefore, a large number of juvenile cuttlefish often enter the net at the same time as other fish. This kind of net is very harmful to the natural reproduction of cuttlefish and should also be banned as soon as possible. However, the operation of sea bream nets and large fishing nets is closely related to the livelihood of fishermen, and a suitable ban cannot be determined without further detailed research.</p>
<p>In summary, based on the above principles, six measures can be drafted for the fishing ban period and banning the scraping and drying of fishing cages, as follows: First, the cuttlefish fishing ban period is set from June 20th to July 20th every year. During this period, all cage fishing or net fishing fishermen are prohibited from fishing. Second, all fish cages for catching cuttlefish should be left in the sea after June 20th and not allowed to be taken out for reuse. Third, it is not allowed to pat the cage when raising the fish cage during fishing. Fourth, fish eggs which have been put in the water must not be transferred to the land again. When eggs are attached to the cage in excess, the old cage mountain rope can be taken off and discarded into the sea, and the new cage can be reattached to the dry rope. Fifth, the above-mentioned fishing ban period and banning measures shall be implemented by personnel from the governments of each county in this province, the fisheries police bureau, and the construction department. If people find any violations of the above regulations, they must also report to the above-mentioned executive agencies at any time. Sixth, fishermen who violate the above regulations shall be fined more than five yuan and their fishing gear may be confiscated. Those who violate the regulations more than twice shall be punished with double fines and their fishing rights shall be revoked. The above six banning measures (the ban on catching small cuttlefish is intended to be studied further) are in line with the facts, and will not have a great impact on the livelihood of fishermen when implemented, and seem to be feasible, but people have shallow knowledge, and are accustomed to the customs, and may not be easy to implement for a while, so it is intended to propose setting up implementation areas to test the above measures. Before the trial implementation has yielded any results, the other locations will remain the same, so as to avoid fishing disputes. The fundamental cause of the cage and net fishing disputes lies in the conflict of interests of the fishermen (which has no relationship with the reproduction issue). The solution seems to be the exclusive fishing rights and fishing rights, so that one model and one net have a certain operating location, and there will be no conflict. On the other hand, regardless of cages and nets, they must be registered, so that the government can have perfect statistics, and the annual catch of cuttlefish can be clearly understood. The rise and fall of the industry will provide a basis for future administrative facilities, and the benefits will be great."</p>

The following resolutions were made:</p>
<p>* A letter will be sent to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, requesting them to redeem copper coins daily according to the Ministry of Finance's regulations.</p>
<p>* It will be stipulated that the copper coin exchange rate be 3,000 *wen*, not to fluctuate. A request will be submitted to the county government to issue a public notice.</p>
<p>* A letter will be sent to the County Chamber of Commerce, requesting them to convene a meeting of the money exchange industry guild to set the exchange rate at 3,000 *wen*.</p>
<p>* All representatives will go to the County Chamber of Commerce to liaise and request prompt action to maintain commerce.</p>
<p>* The County Chamber of Commerce is requested to telegraph the Ministry of Finance at any time, requesting a directive to all branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to redeem copper coins daily until the new auxiliary currency is widely circulated.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Invention of an Economical Electric Lamp <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Qian Gongwei, a resident of this county, has been engaged in scientific research and has invented an economical electric lamp. The structure is sturdy and easy to install, making it a useful tool for saving daily electricity consumption. Simply place the lamp over the existing electric lamp without any other steps, and you can use both large and small lights. It is most suitable for keeping a light on all night. The electricity consumption, calculated for eight hours of burning each night, is only two copper coins. Not only is the brightness appropriate, but the style is also beautiful and the price is low, making it extremely economical. A patent has been granted by the National Government, and preparations are now underway to transport machinery models to Wuxi to set up a factory and rush to produce the product for domestic and international sales. Qian Jun previously opened the Jin Yi Electrical Appliance Company on the third floor of the Salt Industry Building on Beijing Road in Shanghai. Recently, merchants from other areas have heard the news and have come to request sales, as it is very much in line with the needs of society.</p>

<p>To the esteemed editor of the *Shen Bao*:</p>
<p>I have read a news item on the third page of your newspaper on the 23rd, entitled "Taicang Party Department Sends Letter to County Education Bureau Director." Upon investigation, this does not match the facts. The meeting place that day was the Mass Education Center. Jin Cheng arrived at the center at 8:41 AM. At that time, County Party Committee member Huang Yinggong also arrived. After resting for about ten minutes and comparing the time, Director Zhou of the center inquired with the Taicang Bank and learned that it was exactly 9:00 AM. This shows that Jin Cheng's watch was not wrong. The statement that "the Education Bureau Director did not arrive until after 10:00 AM" is a false accusation. Furthermore, before the reading of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, the master of ceremonies did not call for everyone to recite aloud along with the voice. However, the primary school students near the front of the stage, upon hearing the chairman's voice, immediately recited along with the voice according to their usual habits. Those standing behind were not prepared for this and followed along one after another, resulting in a lack of uniformity. Moreover, because the chairman's pronunciation location at the time was not at the front of the stage and he was not facing the audience, many in the audience could not clearly distinguish whether to respond or not. However, the meeting was orderly from beginning to end. This also shows that there was no so-called "omission of important words." Moreover, Jin Cheng has been a responsible person in education for many years, how could he not be able to recite the will? Some local newspapers have published rumors based on misinformation, and a letter has already been sent to correct them. The news in your newspaper is likely based on local newspapers. Jin Cheng is truly afraid that the rumors will become increasingly illusory, so he has sent a special letter requesting a correction.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Guan Jincheng, February 23rd, afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Special Article: A Commoner's View on Civilian Anti-Gas Defense (Continued) <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Jun</p>
<p>Although on the battlefield, complete gasification is not easy due to the movement of the battle lines, in the city, it can be completely gasified by aerial attacks or artillery fire. However, if the citizens have adequate training and knowledge in gas defense, can calm their minds, and handle it calmly, there is nothing to fear. The purpose of using poison gas is not only to kill and injure the enemy's military and civilians, but also to undermine the enemy's morale, harm its order, and achieve both lethal and psychological effects.</p>
<p>6. Matters to Pay Attention to in Gas Defense</p>
<p>In the past two years, our authorities, in view of the tension in the international situation and the intensity of the great powers' war preparations, have held one or two air defense exhibitions and air defense exercises. At that time, many propaganda teams were organized to put up slogans along the streets, distribute leaflets, and give lectures on defense methods, instilling various kinds of knowledge, and providing much guidance to citizens on gas defense and air defense. The points that should be noted are briefly described below:</p>
<p>Selection of Personnel: (A) The personnel in charge of air defense and gas defense propaganda, organization, training, guidance, and other work should be mainly composed of air defense and gas defense specialists, but at a minimum, they must also be very knowledgeable in military science. (B) The materials for explanation or instruction must be well understood and explained in detail, so that citizens can thoroughly understand them. (C) With a military mindset, have a considerable assessment of the effectiveness of poison gas, but do not exaggerate it, so as not to scare citizens. (D) Use practical experience to explain defense methods, so that citizens will not panic when real poison gas comes, and can maintain order and tranquility. (E) The instructions for defensive equipment must be simple, economical, and convenient, and must not focus on one side.</p>
<p>Defense Methods: Individual defense equipment, gas masks are very good, but they are national weapons and cannot be issued to civilians at will. Moreover, in our country, which is economically stretched, the replenishment of gas masks for the national defense forces is still insufficient. If they are to be issued to the people, it is also difficult to do so in practice. If the people were to buy them, there is no large-scale manufacturing plant in our country to meet the needs of the citizens. Even if factories were established and manufactured in large quantities, our poor countrymen (each costing about twelve yuan) would find it difficult to prepare one each. Even the average middle-class citizen can prepare one, but the method of use and preservation must also be given considerable education and practice. In practice, it is best to adopt the following simple methods: (A) All effective poison gases are heavier than air and have the property of flowing downwards. The best defense is to run to a high place (such as climbing a building or going up a mountain). (B) The release of poison gas is greatly affected by the wind direction and has a tendency to flow with the wind. To avoid it, go to the left, right, or upwind. (C) Low-lying areas and alleys are places where poison gas accumulates, as they are not easily dissipated. Pay attention to avoiding them. (D) Poison gases with lethal properties take several hours or even days to take effect. If rescue is prompt, there is no danger. In such cases, go to a shelter or rescue station for treatment as soon as possible. (E) Tear gas is not life-threatening unless in extremely high concentrations. If you encounter it, close your eyes tightly. It will only take an hour at most. (F) Many poison gases decompose with water. Covering the mouth and nose with a wet towel can also defend against them. Even if the poison gas does not decompose with water, it can reduce the amount absorbed. (G) The method of group defense should be a gas-proof shelter, but it is also subject to economic constraints. For convenience, it is best to use the lower part of the building as a gas-proof shelter. However, most houses in our country, although wide and spacious, are made of flimsy materials and will be reduced to ashes in the event of a bombing. There are also many gaps in the tiles and walls, which are dangerous for leaking poison gas. Residential buildings in cities, on the other hand, are made of stronger materials, but there are very few that are suitable. To address the gas defense problem, the improvement of urban buildings should be the top priority. Appendix: The following are the conditions and precautions for shelters: 1. The renovation procedures are simple, easy to enter, and close to food storage. 2. Constructed tightly, with no easy entry for outside air. 3. The entrance and exit doors must have two layers, and be at least four feet apart (eight feet for rescue stations) so that two curtains are not opened at the same time when entering and exiting. The curtains must also be tightly installed. 4. Ordinary shells and bombs will not damage it, so the construction must be solid. 5. Since the air inside the shelter is isolated from the outside, and there are many people, there is of course a need for air supply, so there must be ventilation equipment. The air that is brought in must be filtered through a gas filter. The ventilation method can be manual or mechanical. 6. To prevent the intrusion of poison gas, the internal air pressure must be greater than the outside. 7. A layer of lime must be laid on the ground to absorb the carbon dioxide exhaled by people. 8. When leaving the shelter, the white (lime or bleaching powder) traces on the feet must be removed to avoid being detected by enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>7. Disinfection and Rescue</p>
<p>Disinfection methods are the responsibility of disinfection teams, but the public should also know the basics for temporary disposal. (A) Methods of disinfecting areas: (A) Burning method: If there is gas (except liquid) in an area, the burning method can be used to drive it out by expanding the volume of the gas. (B) Soil piling method: If there is liquid gas in an area, soil piling can be used to bury it. (C) Spraying method: If there is unstable gas in an area, water can be used to decompose it. (B) Methods of disinfecting equipment: (A) Blowing method: If equipment is contaminated with gas, it can be hung in a large wind opening and allowed to be blown to remove the gas. (B) Sunning method: If equipment is contaminated with gas, it can be placed in the sun to decompose the gas. (C) Boiling method: If equipment is contaminated with gas, it can be placed in boiling water to remove the gas by steam pressure. (D) Other items, such as utensils, that are contaminated with gas, can be rubbed with petroleum or volatile oil to disinfect them. (C) Methods of rescue: (A) Move the poisoned person to a safe place and do not subject them to excessive shocks. (B) Give them strong tea and coffee, as well as cardiac stimulants, to restore their spirits. (C) Keep them lying on their backs with a high pillow in fresh air, and give them oxygen when necessary, while maintaining their body temperature. (D) Quickly remove their clothes and give them new clothes, but do not shake them. (E) Seek medical help quickly.</p>
<p>8. Conclusion</p>
<p>Based on the above, poison gas is not a terrible thing, and defense, elimination, and rescue are also very convenient. In the event of a gas attack, the first thing to do is to be calm, act quickly, strictly observe discipline, respect order, and take appropriate action according to the situation. If not, the harm from being poisoned will be small, and the injury from trampling on each other will be great. In particular, the organization, training, and knowledge of our people are very immature, so special attention must be paid to strictly adhering to discipline and observing order.</p>

<p>Principles Approved</p>
<p>The Shanghai Gold and Silver Industry Guild's opinions on the Ministry's silver product silver usage management regulations were presented at the national assembly for discussion and then approved as follows: Article 2 (original omitted) cannot be accepted by the industry. Although three requests for revision were submitted, all were rejected and we must fight to the death. Article 3 (original omitted) The gold and silver stores that are members of this guild have never sold raw silver ingots, and have repeatedly stated this, so there is no need for discussion. Article 4 (original omitted) The reporting procedures have been approved for the first time and will be handled according to the approval. Article 5 (original omitted) In addition to selling and buying silver materials according to regulations, the number of insufficient materials will be purchased from the Central Bank of China with pure silver, which will be melted and guaranteed. The same joint responsibility will be accepted. Article 6 (original omitted) contradicts Article 2. Since Article 2 cannot be complied with, there is no need to set a standard of 30%. Free business is still required. Article 7 (original omitted) Comply with the order to report the quantity sold every six months to the industry association, which will forward it to the Chamber of Commerce, which will forward it to the local Central Bank or Bank of Communications for verification. Article 8 (original omitted) If a gold and silver shop that is a member of this guild encounters a business closure, the remaining silver ornaments and raw materials will be purchased by the members, reported to the guild, and then forwarded to the Chamber of Commerce and the Central Bank for filing to avoid the abandonment of decoration labor costs. Article 9 (original omitted) In the event of theft or attempted theft, the same responsibility will be taken in accordance with the Article 5 guarantee. There will be no irregular actions. If the above occurs, it will naturally be handled according to law. Article 10 (original omitted) Strictly follow the principles, but the inspection authorities should first order the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and this association to send personnel to handle it together to avoid misunderstandings. Article 11 (original omitted) Request that the Ministry of Finance recognize the gold and silver industry as a special handicraft art, and check and follow previous requests to approve the filing of the following note so that it will not be subject to the 30% restriction of Articles 2 and 6. Two principles of petitioning: 1. Pure silver should still be used for silver jewelry. 2. Eight-part silver (i.e., eight parts silver and two parts copper) may be used for utensils and gifts. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Telegrams Sent Nationwide</p>
<p>Yesterday, the association sent special telegrams to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and various ministries and departments, as well as national organizations, stating: "We, the gold and silver industry of the whole country, upon receiving the silver usage management promulgated by the Ministry of Finance in November of this year, which limits the use of chemical silver to manufacture utensils and ornaments, and only allows the mixing of 30% pure silver when necessary, deeply understand that chemical silver is hard and brittle, making it difficult to manufacture by hand. This will cause hundreds of thousands of workers across the country to fall into unemployment. We have repeatedly requested to revise the regulations and eliminate restrictions, but unfortunately, we have not been approved. On the 23rd of this month, we gathered in Shanghai and convened a joint assembly of the gold and silver industry of the whole country at the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Over 600 representatives registered and jointly decided to organize a petition group to make earnest appeals to the authorities. We hereby send a special telegram requesting your inspection and compassion (granting assistance) to achieve the purpose of revision and maintain the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of workers across the country. The telegram is extremely urgent and sincere."</p>
<p>Memorial to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Memorial regarding earnestly requesting revision of the silver usage management regulations, eliminating restrictions on silver content, to maintain the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of silver workers across the country, and to implement the Prime Minister's Principle of People's Livelihood. We, the merchants, previously received the Ministry's silver product silver usage management regulations, which limited the use of chemical silver to manufacture utensils, and only allowed the use of 30% pure silver when necessary. Upon learning of this, everyone was alarmed and at a loss. They all believed that chemical silver is beneficial for machine manufacturing and cannot be competed with by handicrafts. Even with the use of 30% pure silver, it is still hard and brittle and cannot withstand hammering. Therefore, colleagues from various provinces have submitted memorials one after another requesting to revise the regulations, eliminate restrictions on silver content, and divide the reporting of silver inventory into two types: silver utensils and silver materials, for simplicity. We have recently received your approval to divide the reporting of silver inventory into two types, and permission has been granted. However, the silver usage issue has not been allowed to be changed in the slightest. We, humble commoners, dare not have any different opinions on this brilliant decree. However, considering the livelihood of silver workers across the country, it is really impossible to bow our heads and wait for death. Furthermore, it has a great relationship with national essence and customs, so we dare to risk offense and present our case to the Ministry again. As for the fact that chemical silver is hard and brittle, it has already been thoroughly understood by the Ministry. Therefore, in the instructions, there is guidance that "but after heating and hammering, it should not encounter difficulties." We are deeply grateful for your concern and guidance for industry and commerce. However, even if heating and hammering can barely create utensils, they will certainly not be exquisite and beautiful and will eventually be rejected by society. We, the merchants and colleagues, have always used pure silver to manufacture jewelry. However, eight-part silver is used to make utensils. However, it is already difficult during work. The reason for doing so is to make the material slightly stronger and less prone to collision, so as to resist imported silverware. It was never a pleasure to do so. Now, if we are forced to use chemical silver and restrict silver content, then silversmiths will have difficulty applying their skills. I am afraid that foreigners who use machines will take this opportunity to compete with machine-made products and flood in, taking the place of our thousands of years of craftsmanship and causing silversmiths across the country to be eliminated. In recent years, the number of unemployed people in the country has increased day by day. Cries of hunger and cold have followed one another. Some have taken risks out of desperation, and others have been forced to commit suicide. Examining the reasons for their unemployment, the prosperity of machinery and the obsolescence of handicrafts are the primary causes. Now, there are no less than hundreds of thousands of silversmiths across the country. Once they are eliminated, hundreds of thousands of more unemployed people will be added to society. I think that the late Prime Minister always valued the people's livelihood. Now the government wants to implement good policies, but it hinders the people's livelihood. Is this not focusing on one thing and losing sight of the other? We believe that the Ministry's intention in cracking down on silver products is only to prevent the leakage of silver. However, the silver industry in the provinces has explained in detail that silver utensils and ornaments will certainly not be leaked. If you are concerned that colleagues among us may secretly sell silver materials that have not been made into utensils, thus leaking out, then we are willing to provide joint and several guarantees. Strict customs inspections are sufficient to stop smuggling. Why should we give up eating because of choking, and simply cut off the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of people? Our country values gold and silver and despises copper, iron, tin, and lead. It has been like this for thousands of years. The reason why gold and silver are valuable and copper, iron, tin, and lead are cheap is that gold and silver are resistant to water and fire, without any consumption or erosion, and can always maintain their value, while copper, iron, tin, and lead have the danger of rusting. Moreover, when people have abundant wealth, purchasing silverware is no different from saving. Common people often waste pocket money. If they put it into utensils, they will not be willing to give it up easily unless it is absolutely necessary. Therefore, although gold and silver utensils seem luxurious, they can actually cultivate thrift. Moreover, because of their valuable value, they can be used to alleviate emergencies. If chemical silver is easily rusted, it cannot always maintain its value. Once made into utensils, they will be like scrap copper and rotten iron and will not be sufficient to store for emergencies. Furthermore, the aesthetic concept of the Chinese people cannot be completely eliminated. Because its value is not very expensive, there is a rush to compete for novelty and beauty, with endless patterns. It is purchased today and discarded tomorrow. Now the government is training the people to be frugal, but it is starting a trend of extravagance, so how can the people save? The reason why our country is inferior to other countries is machinery. The reason why other countries are inferior to our country is handicrafts. Therefore, our country's old crafts have long been valued by other countries. The carving of silversmiths has the same cultural and artistic skills as bamboo engraving and stone carving. It can also be called a national essence. Now the government wants to promote cultural arts and preserve the national essence, but it restricts silversmiths, preventing them from developing their skills, simply giving foreigners the opportunity to invade with machinery and cutting off the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of people. This is not only self-abandonment, but also a violation of the Prime Minister's principle of giving priority to the people's livelihood. In short, no matter what, there is no risk of silver products leaking out. There is no difference between silver in the hands of the people and in the hands of the government. The gold and silver industry has long been lifeless today. We know that the survival of an industry is not important to the government. Even if we cry out and call for help, it is not enough to move the compassion of those above. However, we must be clear and dare to state our case because we are petitioning for the lives of hundreds of thousands of silversmiths. If they are reduced to unemployment, where will the Ministry place them? Therefore, we are forced to submit this memorial together, earnestly requesting your compassion and approval to revise the silver usage management regulations, eliminating restrictions on the content of silver, so as to implement the Prime Minister's Principle of People's Livelihood and maintain the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of silver workers. Birds about to die cry mournfully. We ask that you have compassion, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Memorial to the Central Government</p>
<p>Memorial regarding the silver product silver usage management regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, which force the use of chemical silver and restrict the content of silver, making handicraft manufacturing extremely difficult, simply giving foreigners the opportunity to invade with machinery, causing hundreds of thousands of silver workers across the country to fall into unemployment, and having a great impact on the national essence and customs. We are forced to earnestly request your compassion and relief to maintain the livelihood of silversmiths and implement the Prime Minister's Principle of People's Livelihood. The reason is that the Ministry of Finance promulgated the silver product silver usage management regulations on November 4, 24, which limited the use of chemical silver to manufacture utensils, and only allowed the use of 30% pure silver when necessary. Upon learning of this, we were alarmed and at a loss. We all believe that chemical silver is beneficial for machine manufacturing and cannot be competed with by handicrafts. Even with the use of 30% pure silver, it is still hard and brittle and cannot withstand hammering. Colleagues from various provinces have requested the Ministry of Finance to revise the regulations, eliminate restrictions on silver content, but unfortunately, the Ministry of Finance's instructions have not allowed any changes. We, humble merchants, dare not have any different opinions on this brilliant decree. However, considering the livelihood of silver workers across the country, it is really impossible to bow our heads and wait for death. Furthermore, it has a great relationship with national essence and customs, so we dare to risk offense and state our case to your association (yuan). As for the fact that chemical silver is hard and brittle, it is also well known by the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, its instructions state that "but after heating and hammering, it should not feel difficult," and so on. However, even if heating and hammering can barely create utensils, they will certainly not be exquisite and beautiful and will eventually be rejected by society. We, the merchants and colleagues, have always used pure silver to manufacture jewelry. However, eight-part silver is used to make utensils. However, it is already difficult during work. The reason for doing so is to make the material slightly stronger and less prone to collision, so as to resist imported silverware. It was never a pleasure to do so.

Now, there are no less than hundreds of thousands of silversmiths across the country. Once they are eliminated, hundreds of thousands of more unemployed people will be added to society. I think that the late Prime Minister always valued the people's livelihood. Now the government wants to implement good policies, but it hinders the people's livelihood. Is this not focusing on one thing and losing sight of the other? We believe that cracking down on silver products will certainly not prevent them from leaking out. The traitors who are not afraid of the law only want to profit from smuggling them out. The colleagues, however, do not sell unfinished silver materials. The silver utensils and ornaments they sell must add labor costs on top of the value of the silver, or be more expensive than the original silver price. How can smugglers profit from this? If you are concerned that there may be unscrupulous people among us who secretly sell unfinished silver materials, thus leaking out, then we are willing to provide joint and several guarantees. Moreover, strict customs inspections are sufficient to stop smuggling. Why should we give up eating because of choking, and simply cut off the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of people? Our country values gold and silver and despises copper, iron, tin, and lead. It has been like this for thousands of years. The reason why gold and silver are valuable and copper, iron, tin, and lead are cheap is that gold and silver, even after being exposed to water and fire, do not lose any of their original form and can always maintain their value, while copper, iron, tin, and lead have the danger of rusting. Moreover, when people have abundant wealth, purchasing silverware is no different from saving. Common people often waste pocket money. If they put it into utensils, they will not be willing to give it up easily unless it is absolutely necessary. Therefore, although gold and silver utensils seem luxurious, they can actually cultivate thrift. Moreover, because of their valuable value, they can be used to alleviate emergencies.

This is not only self-abandonment, but also a violation of the Prime Minister's principle of giving priority to the people's livelihood. The difficulties of our operations in recent years have long been like yellow leaves after frost, falling without shaking. Its survival or death depends on its nature. However, we think that hundreds of thousands of silver workers will all be lost. We earnestly ask your association (yuan) to have compassion and provide relief, order the Ministry of Finance to revise the original regulations, eliminate restrictions on silver content, so that manual manufacturing can be carried out, to maintain the livelihood of silver workers across the country, and to implement the Prime Minister's Principle of People's Livelihood. We present our case in fear and trembling, unable to express our urgency. Please, Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Executive Yuan of the National Government.</p>
<p>Request for Assistance</p>
<p>Yesterday, the association sent special letters in the name of the assembly to Shanghai business leaders Yu Zhiqing, Du Yuesheng, Yu Zuoting, and Lin Kanghou, requesting assistance. The original letter stated: "Respected gentlemen Qiaqing, Yuesheng, Zuoting, and Kanghou, unfortunately, in recent years, our industry has been affected by the weakness of the social economy and the prevalence of women cutting their hair. The decline in our business has been like an autumn forest after frost, with only dead branches remaining. Therefore, those who cannot support themselves and go bankrupt are following one another. The rest are simply trying to maintain the livelihood of their employees and maintain the facade. We only hope that we will not be pruned in the future, or we may be able to survive for a few more years. Who knew that misfortune would come and disaster would occur unexpectedly. On November 4th of last year, the Ministry of Finance promulgated silver product silver usage management regulations, which do not allow the manufacture of utensils and ornaments with pure silver and force the use of chemical silver made of zinc, copper, and lead. Only 30% pure silver is allowed to be mixed in when necessary. This is no different from putting us in a desperate situation and driving all employees to the path of unemployment. Therefore, colleagues from various provinces were alarmed and submitted petitions to the Ministry of Finance one after another to revise the regulations and eliminate restrictions, but unfortunately, they have not been approved. We believe that our industry has always occupied a considerable position in commerce, and its relationship to the prosperity of the market is not insignificant, especially in Shanghai. Now, pure silver is prohibited and replaced with chemical silver. Regardless of whether it is hard and brittle or difficult to manufacture by hand, it will certainly not be able to meet the psychological needs of society. The demise of our industry can be counted on the fingers. To revive commerce and prosper the market is something that the government attaches importance to. However, chemical silver hinders the lifeline of our industry. Has the authorities not considered this yet? Therefore, we and others have no choice but to consider petitioning the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance to make earnest requests. We are afraid that our voices are too weak to be heard. We hope that you, gentlemen, have high moral character and are respected by the authorities. You have always protected merchants in every possible way.

<p>The Special District Telephone Issue Committee, based on the resolution of the joint conference of various organizations, yesterday sent letters to various organizations in this city, stating: "To whom it may concern, the Shanghai Telephone Company, disregarding the current economic downturn and the desolation of industry and commerce, as well as the fact that public anger is mounting and arbitrary actions are bound to fail, only seeks to satisfy its desire for an annual interest rate of one percent. It is acting perversely and recklessly, regardless of the consequences. Even considering the resolute collection of fees, we fear that the method of calculating the number of calls and the increased burden on users will only lead to more disputes. On the 20th of this month, this committee convened a joint conference of various organizations and resolved to form a Design Committee, sending letters to various organizations, requesting them to nominate one representative to serve as a member of the Design Committee. Accordingly, we are recording the case and sending this letter, hoping that you will nominate a person and reply to this committee, so that we can schedule a meeting as soon as possible. Thank you for your cooperation."</p>
<h3 id="e86">French Concession Telephone Users Issue Declaration Yesterday - Will Disconnect Services if Demands Are Not Met <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Huang Xianggu, Mao Yun, Jin Liren, Cai Hongtian, Shang Mujiang, Gong Jingyan, Lu Zhizheng, Zhang Shishi, Zai Manyun, Lin Kecong, Zhu Xuefan, Zhang Yingzeng, Lü Qiuren, Xia Weiqing, Xu Wenrong, Xu Keren, Xu Zhenyu, Huang Zhaoxiong, He Yuanming, Du Gang, Wu Xiu, Qu Zhenhua, Gu Wensheng, Tang Huimin, Zhu Wende, Chen Kecheng, and other 1,647 telephone users in the French Concession, issued a declaration yesterday in opposition to the new telephone fee regulations: "The Shanghai Telephone Company, disregarding public opinion, will implement new regulations from March 1st, effectively increasing prices in disguise. The Public Concession's Municipal Council is also maintaining its so-called one percent official profit and resolutely approving the regulations, without first seeking the consent of the French Concession's Board of Directors. The Public Concession's Municipal Council has no opportunity to consider the company's new fee regulations. Although the Chinese directors attending the French Concession's Board of Directors have made efforts to hold differing opinions, they ultimately cannot achieve the fundamental purpose of our decision. As a compromise, the duration of each call, a generally unspoken issue, has been extended from the strict limitation of three minutes to five minutes. Although this matter is minor, according to the company's statistics, it will also result in significant losses. Regarding the two proposals to increase the number of calls and reduce the base fee, there has been no way to raise them. It is rumored that if the French Concession's Board of Directors' initial proposal is followed, increasing the number of calls from 100 to 150 for residential users and from 150 to 200 for commercial users, the company would lose 40,000 yuan per month. However, the company's expenses can certainly be reduced by more than this 40,000 yuan. Since this arbitration proposal, which is beneficial to the company, cannot be accepted, it is clear that the French Concession's Board of Directors can no longer make proposals. Therefore, the company's new regulations, scheduled to be implemented on March 1st, have become an unshakeable iron law. The company's desire to increase prices has been long-standing. As far back as July of the 21st year of the Republic of China, the original price rate was increased by 25 percent, with residential users increasing from 52 taels of silver to 65 taels, and commercial users increasing from 78 taels of silver to 105 taels. Fifteen months later, in October of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, there was another proposal to increase prices by one-fifth. Although this was not realized, its insatiable desire for extortion was fully exposed. Is this the proper attitude of an enterprise? Is this the means that a public utility should have? Although telephone users have strongly resisted each time, they are scattered like sand and ultimately suppressed. This has happened more than once in history. The company is accustomed to this situation and will do as it pleases, violating laws and reason. It will increase prices three times in as many years, and users will be helpless. We, the telephone users, looking to the future, must unite to resist the company's tyranny and eradicate future oppression. We are willing to endure the pain now. If the demands put forward by the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession cannot be met, we will disconnect our services. We know that the company cannot be reasoned with, so we will use passive resistance to issue a serious warning, hoping to prevent endless exploitation in the future. This is our declaration. February 23rd, 25th year of the Republic of China."</p>
<h3 id="e87">Shortage of 20-Cent Nickel Auxiliary Coins - Additional 240,000 Yuan Minted - Mint Has Delivered to Central Bank <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, the Central Mint, due to the shortage of 20-cent nickel coins after the issuance of the new auxiliary coins, has recently increased the minting of 240,000 yuan to meet the demand. These coins have been delivered to the Central Bank for exchange and circulation. At the same time, a strict investigation is being conducted to identify and crack down on counterfeiters of the new auxiliary coins. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Increased Minting of Nickel Coins</p>
<p>Since the official issuance of the new auxiliary coins on the tenth of this month, the demand for exchange has increased sharply in various places, resulting in an insufficient distribution of the original three types of nickel coins and two types of copper coins. Among them, the 20-cent nickel coins were the most scarce, as the original blanks were all imported from abroad. The first batch that arrived in Shanghai was small in quantity, so it was sold out within a few days of issuance. It is now reported that the second batch of 20-cent nickel blanks has arrived and is being mass-minted by the Central Mint, with patterns engraved. A total of 240,000 yuan has been minted, packed into 80 large boxes, each containing 15,000 coins, worth 3,000 yuan. They were successively transported to the Central Bank in the past two days for distribution and exchange in various places, which should temporarily alleviate the shortage.</p>
<p>Strict Investigation of Counterfeiting</p>
<p>The Central Mint, upon the order of the Ministry of Finance, is investigating the discovery of counterfeit new auxiliary coins in the market shortly after their issuance. If confirmed, strict measures should be taken. After receiving the order, the mint has already begun a strict investigation to crack down on counterfeiters. According to the person in charge of the mint, rumors of counterfeit new auxiliary coins have been circulating for several days. Although the actual situation is unknown, since a small number have already been discovered in the market, prompt action should be taken to prevent future problems. Although nickel coins are hard and difficult to mint, since the original blanks are imported from abroad, if they fall into the hands of counterfeiters, they only need to add a pattern, and there will be an opportunity for counterfeiting. However, the patterns of counterfeit coins are mostly poor and blurry, which is easy to distinguish compared to the fine and clear patterns of genuine coins.</p>

<p>Huadong News Agency: Since the city authorities organized the Anti-Opium Committee, opium addicts have been enthusiastically registering, and those who are quitting are constantly on the way. In order to thoroughly eliminate opium in Shanghai, the Anti-Opium Committee has joined forces with the British and French Concessions to jointly prohibit opium. It is now learned that the two Concessions have been very cooperative recently in preventing opium. They also dispatch personnel every night to conduct investigations, so as to avoid the existence of secret opium dens in hotels and alleys. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>During the Early Prohibition Period, Opium Addicts Avoided</p>
<p>Since the city organized the Anti-Opium Committee this year, those who obeyed the order to register were very enthusiastic. However, stubborn opium addicts still followed the old ways and avoided the authorities. This city has always been a city where Chinese and foreigners live together, and the Concession areas have become a refuge for opium addicts. Not only do opium addicts from this city gather in the Concessions, but also those from other ports come to Shanghai from afar to hide there.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Cooperate to Prevent Opium</p>
<p>After the Anti-Opium Committee and the municipal authorities requested the British and French Concessions to jointly prohibit opium, the Concessions provided assistance. Therefore, opium dens in the Concessions have recently disappeared. However, according to confidential reports, there have been opium addicts who have rented rooms and opened opium dens to provide opium for addicts hiding in the Concessions to smoke.</p>
<p>Dispatch Personnel Every Night to Investigate Hotels</p>
<p>The two authorities, after receiving the reports, dispatch personnel every night to investigate the whereabouts of travelers and urge the hotel authorities to be strict to see if there are any shelter situations. Once discovered, they will be punished according to the law. Therefore, opium has completely disappeared from hotels.</p>
<p>Opium Dens in Lanes and Alleys Expected to Be Cleared</p>
<p>The investigation of opium dens in the common lanes is also very strict. The opium addicts call it "martial law." All petty criminals also lack the ability to cheat. It is heard that, when necessary, they will check every household as the municipal authorities do, so the clearance of opium in the Concessions can be expected.</p>

<h3 id="e102">National Representatives of the Western Medicine Association Petition in Beijing: The Nation's Difficulties are Severe, the Physician's Duty is Important: Petition Resulted in Satisfaction, Recruiting Members <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Western Medicine Association convened its Third National Representative Congress a month ago. Considering that our country has a vast territory and a large population, and the number of Western doctors is insufficient, the congress resolved to send Qian Longzhang, Ye Qubo, Zhang Kelun, Ni Genghua, Liu Xinbo, Yao Zuodun, Zhang Guowei, Huang Aihua, Zeng Xianzhong, Cai Damin, Chu Zhemin, Chu Wenhui, Lu Xiaolin, Gong Yan, Qu Shichang, Liu Renfu, and overseas representative Yang Zhaoji, secretary Qiu Pingsan, and more than forty representatives from various provinces, cities, and counties to Beijing on February 2nd to petition. Now, it is reported that the representatives have completed their mission and returned to their respective hometowns. The representatives gathered in Shanghai and returned to Shanghai from Beijing. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Petition Process</p>
<p>After the representatives arrived in Beijing, they first respectfully went to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to pay their respects. Then, they went to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Health to petition. Secretary-General Weng, Director Liu, and Director Zhou separately received them. Before the promulgation of the Western Medicine Regulations in the 18th year of the Republic (1929), those who have the flexibility to practice medicine will be issued a medical practice license, and the license period will be set for half a year. Those who practiced medicine in the 18th year of the Republic (and have six years of experience so far) will be issued a three-year assistant doctor license, and a medical practice certificate will be exchanged after the expiration. The government understood the people’s concerns and considered public opinion to be reasonable. It has been planning and approving the notification.</p>
<p>Representatives' Feelings</p>
<p>According to Chief Representative Qian Longzhang and Secretary Qiu Pingsan, they were very happy to be able to visit the capital during this petition and felt that our country's politics is on track, and the government's concern for the people's hardships and the following of public opinion fully demonstrates the spirit of democracy. In particular, Director Liu of the Ministry of Health and Director Zhou of the Medical Administration Department are more familiar with social conditions and care for the people's livelihood. At this time when the world situation is dangerous and our country is in serious trouble, we should strengthen unity to support the government, and the doctor's duty is especially important in relation to public health and national health. When the country is in trouble, military doctors serve, which is more important than any other group. Therefore, the meeting has concentrated on gathering medical talents from all over the country and expanding the recruitment of members to enrich the strength and serve the people. It is hoped that the public opinion will give assistance to achieve satisfactory results.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Rickshaw Puller Generously Donates Found Money to Disaster Relief <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, rickshaw puller Liu Yushou found a wallet on the road with fifty yuan in cash. Because he was unable to return it to the owner, he and his company boss Du Yuanlai donated all fifty yuan to the Shanghai Provinces Flood Disaster Relief Association on Yunnan Road in Shanghai to help the disaster relief. The relief association handed the money to the accounting department for verification and collection, remitted it to the disaster area for relief, and gave a receipt to Yu Shou to take back. However, the man has a family of five and his livelihood is extremely difficult. In this cold spring season, when clothes and food are scarce, he can still care about the victims and have the heart to help. It is commendable that he found so much money and did not conceal it. Shanghai is the most prosperous area in our country, with officials, wealthy merchants, and wealthy people living here. Considering their financial resources, it would not be surprising to donate hundreds of thousands of yuan. Even middle-class families who are well-fed and clothed usually have the ability to donate. Seeing the rickshaw puller's righteous act, perhaps they can also be inspired to do so.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Robbery in Chongde Lane: Police Bravely Arrest Robbers: A Total of Five Men and Women Arrested, One Handgun and Eight Bullets Recovered <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Wang Zhengda, a Wuxi native who is 45 years old and sets up a stall selling fresh pig's head meat on Nongzha North Datong Road and Gonghe Road, lives at No. 5 Chongde Lane, Nanxing Road, East Wing, third floor. Between 7:00 PM and 8:00 PM the night before last, several robbers speaking with a northern accent suddenly came to Wang's house. One robber held a handgun, and two robbers broke into the bedroom, rummaging through boxes and cabinets, but they did not find anything. Later, they found 55 yuan in national currency, 34 jiao in small silver coins, 40 fen in new subsidiary coins, and 27 copper coins on Wang Zhengda's body. The robbers were not satisfied and were about to go upstairs to search when Wang's roommate heard about it and shouted for robbers. Seeing that the opportunity was not good, the robbers fled in different directions. One robber was followed by the victim to Haichang Branch Road on Gonghe Xin Road. Li Lanyuan, the police officer at post number 29 of the Zhongxing Road Police Station, learned of this and chased after him. The robber became anxious and mistakenly ran into a dead end alley. He fired two shots with his handgun. Officer Li also returned fire. Later, the robber hid next to a rickshaw at the entrance of the alley. Not long after, the robber ran out of the alley and was tackled by Officer Li, who immediately seized the handgun. It was a ten-shot Browning. Other than the two shots that were fired, the gun still contained eight live rounds. The officer took the robber, the handgun, and the bullets to the station. After a brief interrogation by Inspector Xie Zhongyi, he was escorted to the Xinwen Sub-Bureau and handed over to the Criminal Investigation Squad to arrest the remaining gang members. The robber confessed that his name was Zhao Desheng, 35 years old, from Ningbo. He planned to divide the spoils at the Anle Hotel on North Zhejiang Road. He also had accomplices Wang Desheng in room 31 on the third floor of the Second Chunjiang Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, and Chen Amao, Liu Jianqing, Zhang Yongsheng, and others living in Yongxing Road, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. After obtaining the confession, the squad, led by Deputy Captain Shi Zuhan, along with team leaders Li Shouchen and Li Guiqing, detectives Zhang Shuwen, Zang Nai, and Yang Wangcai, and French police officers, went to different locations. They found Wang Desheng, 30 years old, and Shen, 24 years old, both from Hubei, on Qiujiang Road, and Liu Jianqing, 37 years old, from Shandong, and Zhang Yongsheng, 33 years old, also from Hubei, on Yongxing Road. After being arrested, they confessed that they also robbed Teng Gaotang's house at No. 59 Zhongxing Road on February 14th. After obtaining the confession, the squad escorted all the criminals to the Xinzha Sub-Bureau and transferred them to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>The Longquan Chi bathhouse on the small bridge at the intersection of Laolonghua Town, Bao'an Hui native Cheng Zhaoshan, built the house to open. It was recently due to years of disrepair, dilapidated, and sluggish business. Therefore, at the beginning of the tenth lunar month of this year, the partner Jiangbei native Zhao Changsheng, introduced a transfer lease to a fellow villager An Yihe, who hired sixteen people to continue operating, and paid Cheng Zhaoshan 6,000 zhang of assets per month. The bathhouse building suddenly collapsed at about 8:00 PM last night, just as the bathers were arriving, burying seventeen bathers. Among them was Ling Yunyi, a Henan native, 22 years old, who died on the spot due to serious injuries. The remaining seriously injured people included Zhu Guichun from Changzhou and others. Liu Songjian, the patrol officer from the Longhua Branch of the Sixth District, arrived and first sent the sixteen injured people to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road. On the one hand, he ordered the local bailiff to collect and inspect the body of the deceased, and also detained the landlord Cheng Zhaoshan and partner Zhao Changsheng and brought them to the station for questioning. Bathhouse owner An Yihe has fled in fear of punishment.</p>

<p>Cai Xianzong, a local resident, 38 years old, has been running a butcher shop in Lan Nidu, Pudong. Cai has an ugly face, but is quite honest. Last autumn, because his twelve-year-old only son died, and seeing that his wife had not given birth for many years, he was deeply afraid of having no one to rely on in his old age. The thought of taking a concubine arose spontaneously. Not long after, he met a con artist who pretended to introduce a concubine. Three days after entering the house, she rolled away with some property and disappeared without a trace, suffering a loss of six or seven hundred yuan. In despair, he was led by several friends to a hotel in Xiaodongmen to open a room to relieve his boredom. The hotel tea room waiter Pei suddenly introduced a prostitute (commonly known as a "tangpai") to solicit business. Cai saw that the woman looked acceptable, and after being encouraged by his friends, he agreed to a three-yuan nightly fee and indulged for three nights, spending more than ten yuan in total. He learned that the woman's name was Wu Qiaozhen, 23 years old, from Nanhui, and had been engaged in prostitution for a long time. Cai staggered back, quite remorseful. Unexpectedly, the prostitute was infected with syphilis. Cai was infected and soon developed the disease and could not get out of bed, suffering greatly. Not only that, the hotel tea room waiter and Qiaozhen saw that Cai was weak and could be deceived, and introduced a Ningbo man named Ling Aliang, who claimed to be Qiaozhen's husband, to scare Cai. On this self-proclaimed Qiaozhen's husband of Ningbo, Qiaozhen led by another man named Pei Tingbao, and brought more than 20 fierce women to Cai's shop to make trouble, claiming that Qiaozhen was Ling's third concubine, and that he had been raped and defiled, and that the jade bracelet and two gold rings she was wearing had been cheated away, a total of more than 500 yuan. Cai was forced to compensate. The quarrel lasted until 2:00 AM, and Cai's friends persuaded them to leave. Those who came asked Cai to reason in the teahouse, but they failed. On the day before, they took the initiative to compromise in Cai's shop, reducing the amount from 500 yuan to 50 yuan, which could be settled. Otherwise, they would force Qiaozhen to commit suicide in Cai's shop as a threat. Cai, who had been infected with syphilis, had a rotten lower body and suffered without recourse. He still wanted to set up words to frighten him to pay money, so he submitted a report to the Pudong Sub-Bureau yesterday for investigation at any time. He was approved by the branch director to file a case.</p>

<p>Wang Xinfen, a woman from Ningbo, is 21 years old this year. When she was 17 years old, she was betrothed to Wang Zheng through a matchmaker and lived in Yilong, Laoximen. Wang Xinfen worked in the Victor Candy Factory on Mintiniyin Road in the French Concession for livelihood and met colleague Wang Xiaomei. They knew each other and were close friends, but Wang Xiaomei had a lover, Qu Qinghua, who saw that Wang Xinfen had some beauty and had bad intentions. In November of the previous year, he pretended to go to Dalian to play and lured Wang Xinfen and Wang Xiaomei to board a ship to Dalian and lived in a tailor shop. Later, Qu Qinghua suddenly claimed to the two Wangs that his friend was arrested for selling drugs and needed money, so he asked them to help temporarily by mortgaging them in a brothel for two weeks, and he would definitely find a way to redeem them at that time. They were taken by train from Dalian to Changchun Toudaogou on the same day and bought into the Tianshun brothel. Wang Xinfen was valued at 650 yuan, and Wang Xiaoshu at 800 yuan. The money was taken and spent by Qu. From then on, the two Wangs fell into the fire pit and were forced to receive customers, suffering deeply, while Qu left and never returned, taking the money and fleeing back to Shanghai alone. Until July of last year, Wang Xinfen suddenly met a customer named Zhu, fell in love at first sight, and told him her story, asking for help. Zhu paid 700 yuan to redeem her and took her back to Dalian and transferred to Shanghai to search for Qu's whereabouts. Until the day before, Qu Qinghua was in the Tongshang Hotel on Avenue Foch, and Wang ran into him, and reported to the Xinzha Patrol and sent Detective Ye Wang to bring Qu into custody. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special Court. Under interrogation, it was said that the incident occurred in Nanshi, so he ordered Qu Qinghua to be transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Chu Minggao, a native of Tiantai, Zhejiang, worked in the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education. In the 20th year of the Republic (1931), he lived with his wife Jin Yueqin in Zhabei. Since the outbreak of the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, when Zhabei was on the front line, Chu and his wife fled to the concession. At that time, Jin Yueqin was pregnant and due. On the fourteenth day of the first lunar month of the 21st year of the Republic (1932), she gave birth to a son, and Chu left without saying goodbye. Jin Yueqin lost her dependence and was extremely miserable. Through the recommendation of others, she became a servant in the clothing store opened by Huang Chanlin at No. 2 Ruikang Lane, Roberts Road, West Shanghai. Recently, Yu Yueqin went to Changzhou and met her husband Chu Minggao on the train, and saw that her husband was accompanied by a young woman. She could not help but be angry and asked him for money, but Chu accused Jin Yueqin of running away from her husband and committing adultery with someone, and they mutually arrested at the North Station Police Bureau. Chu insisted that the clothing store owner Huang Chanlin had an affair with Jin Yueqin, and Jin Daodao Qin Yi found out that her husband had remarried with a woman named Xu Jingfang, and was ordered to be transferred to the local court for nuclear verification, while Yu Youyou declared in the newspaper that Jin Yueqin had misconduct with Huang, and Huang Chanlin was aggrieved for being insulted for no reason, so he hired a lawyer to file a private prosecution with the Criminal Court of the Local Court, accusing Chu Minggao of defaming him and other circumstances. After the court received the complaint, Judge Lu Hongyi heard the case in court the day before yesterday afternoon. Huang Chanlin and Tong Lawyer appeared in court to testify. Huang was 42 years old, from Changzhou, and opened a clothing store. Jin Yueqin was a servant in my house, but Chu Minggao falsely accused me of being an adulterer, and then destroyed my reputation by publishing in the newspaper. He requested legal action. Then, according to Jin Yueqin's testimony, she was 27 years old, from Suzhou, and married Chu Minggao on March 28th of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), renting a house in Zhabei. Later, he abandoned me without news due to the war, and remarried with a woman named Xu Jingfang, and falsely accused me of committing adultery with Huang Chanlin. He was really heartless. He asked for an investigation. The judge obtained the testimony and ordered Chu Minggao, who was in custody, to be brought to the case (Chu was in custody for remarriage). He testified that he was 29 years old and worked in the education field. Jin Yueqin ran away without a trace during the refuge, so he remarried Xu Jingfang on January 22nd of this year. The next day, he met his runaway wife on the way back to Shanghai from Nanjing, and called the police to arrest her. He also admitted that he published a statement in the newspaper on February 4th, etc. Lawyer Dong stated that the dissemination of text was related to private morals, and the defendant was guilty of harming the private prosecutor's reputation and deserved punishment. He requested that a judgment be made in accordance with the law. The judge believed that the case was clear and considered it to be concluded. The verdict was announced yesterday that Chu Minggao disseminated text and damaged the reputation of others, and was fined 50 yuan. If he was to be sentenced to labor service, one yuan would be converted into one day, suspended for five years. After the verdict, he was returned to custody pending further instructions.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Health Department of the Public Works Bureau Announces the Source and Prevention of Smallpox <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Spring Vaccination Work in the Chinese Concession to Begin Soon. The spring vaccination work in the city will be started by both the Municipal Health Bureau and the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession. According to the announcement by the Health Department of the Public Works Bureau regarding the source and prevention of smallpox, smallpox is one of the most widespread and terrifying infectious diseases in China. It is a type of tiny germ, the shape of which is so small that even with the most powerful microscope, it cannot be observed. However, through various experiments, we know how it invades the human body and have a truly effective method of prevention. Current vaccination procedures are extremely simple. If proper attention is paid during implementation, those being vaccinated will experience very little discomfort. It is commonly believed that infants suffer during vaccination, but this is not the case. Infants and young children are more susceptible to smallpox than adults, so vaccination should be given special attention. Caution, cleanliness, and isolation can reduce the spread of smallpox, but vaccination can completely prevent it.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Xing Zhigang Requests Prohibition of Disturbances at Harbors <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Xing Zhigang, a representative of the shipping industry in Pudong West, submitted a petition to the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday requesting an investigation and prohibition of disturbances at harbors. The petition stated: "Regarding the false pretense of names and the extortion of levies, it is requested that the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Security Bureau be ordered to strictly prohibit and maintain the safety of shipping and travel. The Nanhuiguan Wharf and the Gongyi Public Wharf in Nanshi are busy areas for the berthing of ships from Pudong West. Recently, idlers outside the industry have been falsely using the name of the civilian shipping industry to threaten rural ships at the Nanhuiguan and Gongyi Public Wharves, extorting air transport donations of one yuan, six dimes, or three dimes per month per ship, lingering at the harbors, and arbitrarily harassing them, causing unbearable suffering. The term 'civilian shipping industry' has a broad scope. Ships from Pudong West are for the convenience of people in the countryside, going out early and returning late, and have not joined the civilian shipping industry. Moreover, these people outside the industry are not familiar to us. How can they falsely use names to threaten and extort donations from the uneducated at the harbor? The Public Security Bureau has previously investigated and prohibited this. Now the harassment continues as before. Therefore, we once again earnestly petition your esteemed seat to examine and verify the situation, consider the plight of rural ships, and grant an order to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Security Bureau to thoroughly investigate and prohibit the extortion of donations under false names, so as to maintain the rule of law and ensure the safety of shipping and travel. We would be deeply grateful."</p>

<h3 id="e116">Overview of Public Concession Police Personnel Work in the Past Year, Three Chinese Detectives and Chinese Constables Establish Special Merits, Fierce Battle with Robbers Results in Loss of One Policeman <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau Intelligence Office released the Public Concession Police Department's 1935 annual report, which was previously submitted to the Public Works Bureau Board of Directors. The key points are excerpted and disclosed below.</p>
<p>Police Chief Major General Jardine took leave to return to his country in early April of that year. From April 7th to December 31st, the Chief's duties were temporarily assumed by Deputy Chief Major General Bourne.</p>
<p>In that year, the police personnel who received awards for special merits included Chinese Detective Jin Wanrong, who was loyal and brave during the war against heinous bandits and was awarded the first-class medal for special merits. Chinese Constable Wu Zonghai also demonstrated both wisdom and courage while capturing bandits and was awarded the second-class medal for special merits. Furthermore, Chinese Detective Zhang Jinlong, number 90, died from injuries sustained while pursuing bandits. His loyalty, bravery, and decisiveness are truly admirable, and he was posthumously awarded the second-class medal for distinguished service. Statistics for that year show that police personnel engaged in fierce battles with bandits a total of eighteen times. The police suffered one death and six injuries, while twelve bandits were killed and injured. Regarding the patrol constables, as of the end of the year, the number of Chinese constables and patrolmen under the jurisdiction of the Police Department was 3,791, Russian constables were 100, and Indian constables were 380. All of these numbers showed slight decreases compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>There were no difficulties encountered in recruiting qualified personnel for various positions that year, and the general level of new recruits was adequately maintained. A total of 82 new constables were recruited this year, all of whom were trained and dispatched to serve. The Westerners who joined the police force were all recruited locally. Regarding discipline, with the exception of those whose circumstances were serious and who had received appropriate punishment, all personnel were able to abide by the rules and were deemed satisfactory. The health of police personnel was excellent this year. The average daily percentage of sick police officers was 3.41% for Western constables, 5.30% for Japanese constables, 2.77% for Indian constables, and only 1.78% for Chinese constables.</p>
<p>The Central Police Station and the Police Department began operations on June 3rd of that year. Now all the central police offices are concentrated in one place, which is a major reform in terms of work efficiency. This year, the Police Department armory repaired a total of 5,899 firearms, and no unusable firearms were found throughout the year. One new bulletproof vest was added this year, bringing the total to 354, as well as 80 steel shields. Furthermore, 126 new constables and 133 patrol constables underwent shooting practice with large and small pistols or Mauser pistols, using more than 150,000 rounds of ammunition in total. The shooting skills of each police officer were excellent. This year, the reserve police force was dispatched to suppress riots and robberies a total of 13 times, most of which were not of great importance and had no use for force when they arrived on the scene. They were able to perform their other routine duties, such as assisting police officers in checking pedestrians and guarding the courts, satisfactorily.</p>
<p>This year, the mounted patrol team had a total of eight large horses and thirty-nine small horses. Five small horses were euthanized due to old age. At the end of this year, the Public Concession had a total of 485 special agents, with 73 newly enlisted and 67 retired. There were three shooting competitions. They assisted ordinary police personnel in their duties, including household surveys, the abolished lunar New Year, and the 50th anniversary of the British Emperor's coronation. These agents were extremely efficient, and three of them have received long service medals.</p>

Therefore, all those who applied for registration with the various branch bureaus or the bureau before December 31st, 24th year of the Republic, and those who were ordered to register by the bureau, must bring their temporary receipts to the original registration bureaus to exchange them for official licenses before the 29th of this month.

<h3 id="e121">International Theater Hosts Chinese Modern Art Exhibition, From the 27th of this Month to the 10th of Next Month, at 55 Yuanmingyuan Road <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The International Theater of Arts, organized by Chinese and Western artists in Shanghai, performed "Wang Baochuan" at the Shanghai Grand Theater last year, which was well received by the public. Mrs. Fohs, the general manager of the theater, collected 150 oil and ink paintings created recently by 30 famous artists, including Liu Haisu, Wang Yiting, and Wang Jiyuan, and will hold the Chinese Modern Painting Exhibition at the theater at 55 Yuanmingyuan Road in Shanghai from the 27th of this month to the 10th of March. The opening ceremony will be held at the venue at 4 pm on the 27th, and Mayor Wu will be invited to cut the ribbon. It is also reported that the diplomatic corps stationed in Shanghai from various countries will attend the exhibition. The catalog of exhibits has a preface written by Cai Yuanpei, etc. The preface of Cai is recorded as follows: "The intense aesthetic sense and rich imagination contained in Chinese painting create the most perfect aesthetic model in our ideals. Since the Han Dynasty, Chinese painting has occupied a unique position in the history of world art. The excellence of its works, as evidenced by the surviving ones today, proves this. In the Tang Dynasty, Chinese painting was divided into the Northern and Southern schools, which was a major event in the history of Chinese painting. Li Sixun, the leader of the Northern school, created landscape painting. This style flourished in the Song Dynasty. Wang Wei, the master of the Southern school, was unique and pioneered a new path, abandoning the rigid forms of the past and replacing them with soft and gentle brushstrokes. This style still exists today. Commentators often say that Southern school paintings are favored by general literati, while Northern school paintings are favored by artisans. This statement is somewhat too generalized. Judging from historical facts, the primary condition for both the Northern and Southern schools is Xie He's so-called 'qi yun sheng dong' (spiritual consonance, life-movement). This element of painting is not something that anyone can obtain. It is the product of the artist's own rich learning and experience. Therefore, excellent works of our country's painting all have this characteristic, and this is why our country's painting is superior to other countries. Western researchers of Eastern culture are often fascinated by our country's ancient art and neglect Chinese modern art, and even say that there is no modern art to speak of in our country, which is a very wrong view. Taking painting as an example, for thousands of years, its style has continued without interruption. To this day, its painting style not only remains, but is also carried forward by modern artists. Not only do they have a deep understanding of ancient artists in their own country, but they also have a deep understanding of the works of Western masters. Therefore, with the learning of these modern artists, and engaging in the sorting out and development of our country's inherent art, there should be new and extraordinary views and ideas. This International Theater is organizing a modern Chinese painting exhibition, and its exhibitors are all writers who bear the responsibility of revitalizing modern Chinese art. Among the exhibitors, we want to especially mention Liu Haisu, Wang Yiting, Huang Binhong, and Wang Jiyuan. Liu Haisu has spared no effort in promoting modern art in our country, which is well known, and his own talent is unique. In the past 20 years, he has worked hard and studied extensively, and his achievements are to discard the dross of ancient art, liberate our country's art from the decay and decorate it with a fresh and lively face. Mr. Liu is a revolutionary painter who does not compromise. Professor Lai Luggu of France called him 'the master of the revival of Chinese art,' which is well founded. Mr. Liu has traveled to Europe twice to promote our country's art, and has hosted modern Chinese painting exhibitions in various European countries, so that Westerners are relieved of their modern art. His footsteps have been well-received, and he is a great vitality in our country's art world. Wang Yiting and Huang Binhong are both well-learned scholars and famous figures in the art world, and their works have the magic of perfection. Wang Jiyuan is a writer who is constantly striving for progress. His art has its own unique features. He has held solo exhibitions in Japan and Europe in the past, and has been deeply praised by people in those countries. This International Art Association is organizing the Chinese Book Exhibition, which is enough to represent the cooperation between Chinese and foreign cultures. It is hoped that this spirit of cooperation can be continuously expanded and popularized in other Chinese and foreign relations."</p>
<h3 id="e122">Zheng Yongyu Sues Zheng Bozhao, Case Dismissed <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Yongchu, the manager of the Yongtai Stack tobacco shop on Henan Road in the city, sued Yue merchant Zheng Bozhao for breach of trust and embezzlement. After repeated summons by the First Special District Court, the judgment was made yesterday (22nd): "Zheng Bozhao dismissed." The reasons for the judgment are as follows: "If the statute of limitations for prosecution has been completed, a judgment of dismissal shall be issued. This is clearly stipulated in Article 294, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law. In this case, the plaintiff sued for embezzlement and breach of trust. The main points of his lawsuit are: 'My father, Zheng Shiqing, and others set up the Yongtai Stack tobacco shop on Henan Road and appointed the defendant as the manager to contract the British American Tobacco Company's brand of cigarettes (ie, Hongxibao cigarettes). Later, Shuitaizhan was reorganized into Yongtaihe, and the defendant was still the manager. Unexpectedly, he violated his duties and took advantage of the Yongtaihe brand name to embezzle the right to sell the British American Tobacco Company's cigarettes on behalf of Yongtai Stack for 28 years. It was not until last year (ie, 24th year of the Republic) that the old correspondence of the defendant and the contract with the British American Tobacco Company were found, and he filed a lawsuit accordingly, etc.' Questioning the defendant, I believe that Yongtaihe and Yongtai Stack have a partnership relationship. It is claimed that Yongtaihe is an independent business and was established in 1912 (ie, the first year of the Republic). In the same year, it contracted the exclusive right to sell British American Tobacco Company's cigarettes and was specifically certified by Fish White, director of the British American Tobacco Company. The British American Tobacco Company's cigarettes were contracted by Zheng Bozhao without exception. The object of the crime of embezzlement in Xingfa is limited to objects, not including rights. This is extremely clear from the meaning of Article 335 of the same law, which refers to embezzling one's own possession of other people's objects. The plaintiff in this case accused the defendant of embezzling its right to contract cigarettes, which does not conform to the requirements of the crime of embezzlement. In terms of procedure, the plaintiff said that the defendant had embezzled its rights and violated his duties for 28 years. According to the statute of limitations of the old and new criminal laws, its right to sue has long been extinguished. Assuming that the British American Tobacco Company contracted cigarettes in 1912 (which is beneficial to the plaintiff), it has been more than 24 years. Even if the plaintiff only discovered evidence of the crime last year (ie, 24th year of the Republic), it cannot be considered a reason for suspending the statute of limitations. Moreover, the crime of embezzlement and breach of trust is a consummated crime. Since the plaintiff pointed out that the defendant's act of contracting was an act of embezzlement and breach of trust, then when his act of contracting was established, the crime was completed. Although he still receives commissions for contracting cigarettes, this is an extension of the benefits obtained after the crime and is different from the continuous state of the crime. Its statute of limitations should be calculated from the first year of the Republic (the period of contracting cigarettes). The law at the time of the defendant's act was the effective period of the Provisional Criminal Law. Comparing Article 69, paragraph 1, sections 3 and 4 of the Criminal Law with Article 80, paragraph 1, section 2 of the Criminal Law, the statute of limitations of the Criminal Law should be applied. According to that law, the statute of limitations for the right to sue for the crime of embezzlement is seven years, and the statute of limitations for the crime of breach of trust is three years. Compared with the defendant's act, which was completed 24 years ago, the statute of limitations in this case has long been completed. According to the above regulations, a judgment of dismissal should be issued, and the judgment is made as the main text."</p>

<h3 id="e124">Honest Service from the Clever Advertising Agency <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Clever Advertising Design Agency at No. 29 Edward Road was founded by Pan Yihua, an advertising expert. Mr. Pan was formerly a famous journalist in Shanghai, having served in the film industry for over ten years. Countless Chinese and foreign films and actors owe their fame to his promotional efforts. Mr. Pan is known for his expertise in advertising. While in the film industry, various film production companies and cinemas competed to recruit him. Now, due to the economic downturn in Shanghai, Mr. Pan is willing to serve various industrial and commercial enterprises. He has established the Clever Advertising Design Agency and hired art experts at great expense to handle various artistic advertisements. To fully implement the service tenet, fees are extremely low. Any major industrial and commercial enterprises wishing to engage the agency as a permanent advertising consultant need only pay an annual consulting fee of 100 yuan in national currency. For any promotional advertising matters within the year, if the cost does not exceed 1,000 yuan in national currency, no additional fees will be charged. In addition, an art advertising sample department has been established, specifically for shops that do not frequently publish newspaper advertisements. Matters concerning artistic advertisements, storefront layouts, window displays, merchandise labels, promotional activities, wrapping paper, etc., all require artistic thinking. If stores directly hire people to create samples, the cost is very high. Now, the agency only charges a sample fee of two yuan per store per year. This covers all kinds of art advertising samples, regardless of quantity, without any additional fees. If you wish to have them created after the sample is approved, the price is also very low. Moreover, the originality of the ideas and the pleasing nature of the designs are unmatched in Shanghai. Therefore, businesses with discerning eyes entrust their advertising and promotion to the agency, considering it a wise move. Although the agency has only been open for a month, its daily workload is extremely busy.</p>

<p>The Jiangyuan Lane Weixin Lane branch of the Shanghai Xinzha District Rent Reduction Committee requested the landlord, Runji Rental Accounting House, to reduce rent in September of last year. The Xinzha District Rent Reduction Committee dispatched Standing Committee Member Shan Xingwu to mediate several times and petitioned the Shanghai Municipal District Rent Reduction Federation for assistance. However, the landlord firmly refused to concede, leading to a lawsuit. It was recently heard that the Shanghai First Special District Local Court has ruled that the rent for the houses in the lane should be paid at 85% of the original amount, starting from September 1935. The dispute has been resolved. The Shanghai Mechanical Paper Bag Factory, located at the intersection of Kunming Road and Liaoyang Road in this city, is a leader in the mechanical paper bag industry. Its scale is grand, and its equipment is complete, far surpassing other factories. Therefore, it has been serving all sectors for many years. Its clear printing, exquisite paper bags, fair prices, and prompt delivery are deeply praised by all sectors. Now, to expand its business, the factory strives to provide thorough service to those who entrust it with printing various paper bags and offers particularly favorable prices in return.</p>

Therefore, the association is currently rushing to compile a credibility record. Once the procedures are completed, a general meeting will be convened to formally conclude the association.</p>

<p>A middle-aged Western woman named Guesse rents Room 207 on the second floor of the Broadway Mansions on Suzhou Road, Hongkou. The woman is over forty years old and usually dresses luxuriously and enjoys ornamentation. In addition to being surrounded by jewelry, she also has a platinum ring inlaid with emeralds, worth over six thousand gold coins, which she wears on her finger every day and never takes off. Yesterday afternoon, the woman took it off and placed it in a basin on the table in the room because it was inconvenient to wash. Unexpectedly, in a blink of an eye, the diamond ring had disappeared. She was greatly alarmed and immediately rang the bell to call the waiter to inquire, but the waiter replied that he did not know. Although a search was conducted everywhere, there was no trace of it. In desperation, the woman telegraphed the competent police station, which sent detectives to investigate, but they also found no clue. The waiter in charge of the room was then taken to the police station for questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Notes on the Soviet Print Exhibition <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Xun</p>
<p>I remember a time when we were rarely able to learn about the situation in the Soviet Union from domestic publications. Even in the realm of literature and art, some respectable writers and scholars avoided it like a young lady avoiding asphalt. Not only would they never touch it, but they would also keep their distance and wrinkle their noses. However, things have been different in the last year or two. Naturally, we occasionally still see a few satirical cartoons taken from foreign publications, but more often, we see sincere introductions of the achievements of construction. This makes people look up and see airplanes, water gates, workers' residences, and collective farms, instead of only looking at the ground, thinking about worn-out shoes, shaking their heads, and sighing. These introducers are not people with so-called dangerous political leanings, but they are definitely not gloating over disasters. Therefore, they are very happy to see the peace and prosperity of their neighbors and want to share this happiness with the Chinese people. I believe that this phenomenon is excellent for both China and the Soviet Union. On one hand, the truth is being revealed to us, allowing us to understand. On the other hand, there is no more misunderstanding, and it proves that there are indeed many people in China who "cannot be subdued by power or moved by poverty and humbleness" and who are determined to tell the truth.</p>
<p>However, these introductions are all articles or photographs. This year's print exhibition directly presents art before our eyes. Among the artists, several are familiar to us due to reproductions of their works, but seeing the handmade originals now makes us feel even closer.</p>
<p>Woodcut prints were invented in China long ago, but they declined in the middle of their history. The newly emerging woodcuts of the past five years take their inspiration from Europe and have no connection to ancient woodcuts. Soon, they were suppressed, and there was a lack of teachers, so there has been no particular progress to date. At this exhibition, we can find excellent and numerous models. First, we should pay attention to the master Favorsky, who reformed woodcut prints during the civil war and has been constantly moving forward since then, as well as his school of Deineka, Goncharv, Echerstov, Pikov, etc. Each of them expresses the spirit of truth in their works. We can see how their successors follow the path indicated by their teachers, but use different methods, which shows us that as long as the content is the same, the methods can vary, and that imitation and dependence can never produce true art.</p>
<p>The works of Deineka and Echerstov have not been introduced to China, and unfortunately, there are very few of them here. We have only seen one woodcut by Pavlinov, who is close to Favorsky, but this exhibition makes up for this lack.</p>
<p>Only one woodcut by Krarchnko was fortunate enough to be sent to China and reproduced and introduced. Now, everyone can see more of his original works. His romantic colors can stir the passion of our youth, and his attention to the background and meticulous expression will also benefit viewers. Our painting, since the Song Dynasty, has been dominated by "xieyi" (sketching the idea). Two dots are the eyes, without knowing if they are long or round. One stroke is a crow, without knowing if it is a magpie or a swallow. The pursuit of lofty simplicity has become emptiness. This flaw is still commonly seen in the works of young woodcut artists today. Krarchnko's new work "Dnerrostoruy (Construction in Nepal)" is a wake-up call to those lazy fantasies. As for Piskarev, he is probably the first woodcut artist to be introduced to China. His four illustrations of "The Iron Flood" have long been appreciated by many young readers, and now we see his illustrations for "Anna Karenina" - another aspect of his engraving style.</p>
<p>There are also Mrtiokhin, Khizhinsky, and Mochalov, who are all known to China in advance, as well as the works of many artists who are seeing for the first time. From artists who were already famous before the October Revolution to young artists born in the early 20th century, they are all demonstrating to us the path of cooperation and progress towards peaceful construction. Other artists and works are briefly explained in the exhibition booklet, and at the end, the overall point is revealed: "The general socialist content and the fundamental effort towards realism." There is no need for me to elaborate here.</p>
<p>However, we should also pay attention to the fact that there are works by artists from Ukraine, Georgia, and Belarus. I think that without the October Revolution, these works would not only not be able to meet us, but they might not even have appeared.</p>
<p>Now, more than two hundred works have appeared brilliantly together in Shanghai. In terms of prints alone, it seems to us that they are not as exquisitely woven as French works, nor as bold as German works. However, they are sincere without being stubborn, beautiful without being lascivious, pleasant without being ecstatic, and powerful without being crude. But they are not static either. They make people feel a kind of tremor - a tremor that is like the footsteps of a large army advancing towards the road of construction on solid, vast black soil, step by step, with firm steps.</p>
<p>Postscript: There are five types of prints in the exhibition: woodcuts, collographs (the catalog translates it as "oilcloth engraving," which is quite strange), and the names are self-explanatory. Two types are made by etching copper plates and lithographs with corrosive liquid. Translating them as "copper engraving" and "lithograph" is acceptable, or translating them as "etching" and "lithography," as in the catalog, is also acceptable. There is also a Monotyhe, which is created by painting on a plate and then printing on paper, so although it is a print, it is only a single piece. I think it can only be translated as "monotype print." The explanation in the exhibition booklet translates it as "Monotype," which is no better than not translating it. Sometimes it is translated as "Single Type Studies," which is even more difficult to understand than not translating it. In fact, the explanations without the authors' names are very concise and to the point, but unfortunately, the translation is very confusing. If someone re-translates it, it will still be very useful for those who pay attention to prints, even after the exhibition has closed.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Chinese Vocational Education Society Held Expert Conference Yesterday, Experts Expressed Opinions on National Crisis Education, Special Education Changed to National Revival Education, and Initiated National Salvation Gold Savings Society <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Vocational Education Society held its 10th Expert Conference and Spring Review Conference at Shanghai University yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. The morning session included work reports and expert reviews and opinions. Lunch was at Shanghai University at noon, and the meeting continued at 1:30 PM to discuss the implementation plan for special education, etc. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Experts in Attendance</p>
<p>Including Niu Yongjian, Zhuang Zexuan, Tao Xingzhi, Ou Yuanhuai, Liu Zhanen, Chen Heqin, Chen Qingshi, Wang Zhuoran, Chen Jicheng, Zheng Xigu, Zhang Yousan, Yang Wei Wang, Jia Foru, Pan Yangyao, He Qingru, Lin Zhuoran, Yao Huiquan, Yang Chonggao, Shi She, Wen Chonglu, Xie Xiangzhi, Zhang Yi, Wang Sheng, Zhao Wu, Liang Zhongduan, Lin Meiyan, Zheng Wenhan, Xue Jianming, Wu Cui, etc., more than 40 people in total.</p>
<p>Work Report</p>
<p>Chairmen: Liu Zhanen, Zhuang Zexuan, Ou Yuanhuai; Stenographers: Zhu Zhongzheng, Cai Zhaolian. First, Yang Shuyu delivered the opening speech, followed by work reports. He Jirui reported on research and editing, Pan Yangyao reported on vocational guidance, Yao Huiquan reported on rural service, Yang Weiyu reported on design, Liang Zhongyuan and Zhao Wu reported on supplementary education, Jia Foru reported on the Chinese Vocational School, Xue Mingjian reported on the Labor Autonomous Region, and other temporary reports.</p>
<p>Experts' Opinions</p>
<p>After the work reports, the experts in attendance expressed their opinions on special education. Tao Xingzhi said that the name "Special Education Committee" was used specifically for bandit suppression in Jiangxi, Anhui, and Hubei. Our current discussion on special education may be misunderstood by others. The recent meaning of the Ministry of Education's organization of the Special Education Committee is to cope with the educational policy during the current national crisis period, which is the same as our discussion of new meanings. However, the national crisis education needed in China now should have several characteristics: a single goal, mass-oriented, connected, action-oriented, and official-driven. With the above principles, there is more basis, he said. Liu Zhanen said, "Today's discussion of national crisis education, I think we should come up with a plan that is simple and can be done. In my opinion, it should be divided into two aspects: spiritual and skill-based. The spiritual aspect can be divided into four points: the nation must have self-confidence, be brave, be organized, and be able to sacrifice," he said. Ou Yuanhuai said, "The Ministry of Education attaches importance to the broad sense of special education. It is not possible to have people without leaders, nor is it possible to have leaders without people. The people must be trained, and intellectuals must also be trained," he said. Zheng Xigu said that national crisis education is nothing more than spiritual training, physical training, and skill training. To implement this training, first, there must be strict military management; second, teachers and staff must set an example; third, there must be considerable preparation; and fourth, existing courses must be reduced, he said. Chen Heqin said, "The magnificent singing is most able to inspire young people's patriotic thoughts and national spirit, so songs are a very effective method for training young people." Zhang Yousan said, "It is very difficult for schools to have special inventions. The Academia Sinica should be responsible for special inventions." Zhuang Zexuan said that regarding youth training, in higher education, the engineering college must be fully utilized, students above high school should be trained to have command ability, and technical committees should be organized in various universities to undertake national defense research and implementation work. Chen Jicheng said, "Special education in schools is easy to train, and special training for the people is relatively indirect, so I believe that students should be responsible for organizing and training the people, which will be more effective." In addition, He Qingru, Chen Qingshi, and others also expressed their opinions, which are omitted for brevity.</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals</p>
<p>The meeting continued at 1:00 PM to discuss the proposals. The implementation plan for special education was decided to be changed to the implementation plan for national revival education. The content of the plan from the sixth item onwards was summarized as physical training, spiritual training, skill training, and social activities, and an implementation committee was organized, the list of which was determined by the office. The main working policy for this year was determined, and it was decided to pay attention to the education plan during the extraordinary period. The location for the annual meeting was selected in accordance with the decision of the Du Member Congress. It was decided to choose between Nanning and Xi'an. A temporary motion was made to initiate the National Salvation Gold Savings Society of the Republic of China, which was passed. The meeting adjourned after the discussion. The declaration of national salvation savings is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>National Salvation Savings</p>
<p>The National Salvation Gold Savings Society of the Republic of China declares as follows: After several considerations and discussions, we have decided to initiate the "National Salvation Gold Savings Society of the Republic of China". The ten articles of association have been drafted, and all the purposes, organizational methods, etc., are detailed in them. We should also briefly explain the reasons for initiating this society. We all feel that a country and a nation can survive and support themselves on the land of fierce competition only if they rely on themselves to have a considerable amount of strength. This strength is manifested in culture, politics, economy, and other aspects, and the most important and precious one is the patriotic heart and unity of the entire nation. This can also be regarded as the engine for the development and advancement of all national power, and the nourishment for its prosperity and growth. Patriotic heart is inherent in everyone, and organizational power is not something that Chinese people lack innately. We believe that if we want to universally develop national patriotism and unity, we must have a concrete fact attached to it, because with this concrete fact, everyone can save money, everyone can practice frugality, and everyone can exercise self-discipline. Moreover, this concrete fact must be simple and easy to implement, and it must be easy to cover the entire population and easy to complete the organization. The country to which we entrust our lives has now reached a critical juncture of life and death. Who does not feel the danger? Who does not want to save the country and preserve its existence? However, everyone cannot think of an effective and universal method for a while, so everyone feels bored and anxious. In fact, there is more than one way to save the country. Specialized and general methods should be used in parallel, and it should be recognized that general methods are the basis of specialized methods. We believe that relying on a concrete fact to develop national patriotic enthusiasm and forge unity is the most common, most effective, and most universal method of saving the country. We initiated this society to unite the people of the whole country and create a broad and universal movement and organization by means of a concrete fact of "saving the country through saving money", so that everyone can get an opportunity to train themselves in group living habits, and everyone can develop a red heart to love the country and the nation. Speaking of the methods of this society, there are also several characteristics: Save your own money and keep it yourself, without entrusting others, and trusting your own personality; the amount of money saved is not limited, and it is extremely free; the name of the savings is set as "saving the country", which is simple and easy to understand; the basic organization can be realized anywhere; the joint organization is extremely natural, and the implementation method is not too expensive or difficult, and the large organization can be gradually completed along the natural trend. The patriotic atmosphere can gradually permeate the special environment, and unknowingly, a universal and great national power can be cultivated. This national power, in terms of spirit, is generated internally and strengthened, extremely substantial and not virtual. In terms of material, it is to accumulate a small amount to form a large number. The total number of the whole body may not be small. We believe that this method of saving the country is extremely common and mediocre, but only by being common can it be universally promoted throughout the country, and only by being mediocre can it be easily implemented by everyone in the country. All my comrades, let's get to work!</p>
<h3 id="e136">Jiang Kanghu's Lectures Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Group Pan Gongzhan and Others Gave Speeches, Lectures Once a Week Thereafter</p>
<p>The five groups, including the Municipal Social Education Society, the Sino-Foreign Cultural Association, the Southern University Alumni Association, the Cunwen Society, and the Hongdao Society, specially jointly organized the Jiang Kanghu PhD Lecture Society to promote the revival of Chinese culture and popularize social education. Jiang Kanghu was publicly invited to give systematic lectures every Sunday afternoon at the New New Company on the fourth floor. The official opening meeting was scheduled for 2:00 PM on the 23rd, as reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the association was concerned that the original venue would not be sufficient to accommodate the large number of guests, so it temporarily changed to the New New Restaurant Hall. The opening ceremony was held yesterday, and details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Guests Attending: Including Li Ze and Li Daming of New New Company, Pan Gongzhan, Ding Nianxian, and Lv Hailan of Shanghai Social Education Society, Yang Zunyi, Zhu Xizhou, and Wang Jingcheng of Nanda Alumni Association, He Zhenya, Zhou Huan, Wu Zijing, and Ba Liangyou of Sino-Foreign Cultural Association, Hu Chen and Gao Songkui of Cunwen Society, Wei Tuo and Horton of Hongdao Society, and Li Dachao, Cao Yunxiang, Ma Gongyu, Cheng Gou, Yang Zhongfang, Xu Xiaotian, Xu Taochun, Ding Shaoting, Wang Wancheng, and other audiences from all walks of life, more than 500 people in total.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: The chairman group Pan Gongzhan, Hu Huaichen, Cao Yunxiang, Gao Songkui, Zhou Huan, Li Ze, He Zhenya, Li Dachao, Zhu Xizhou, Wei Tuo, Horton, etc. First, Chairman Pan Gongzhan gave a speech, briefly saying that Mr. Jiang Kanghu had given a public lecture at the Confucius Temple once, and everyone may have heard it. This time, he was invited by various groups to give lectures here. However, in today's serious national crisis and the time when domestic academics are bankrupt, some people may say that Mr. Jiang's lectures are not in line with the times. However, Mr. Jiang focuses on spiritual life. In addition to material production, the salvation and survival should also start from the spiritual aspect, that is, the cultural aspect. We must know that our country's culture has been very glorious for thousands of years. The previous strength was also due to culture. If we abandon the existing culture and do not talk about it today, how can we start in the spiritual aspect of saving the country? This is why Mr. Jiang is interested in this. Today's lectures are not only for individuals, but also for the survival of the nation. Therefore, Mr. Jiang specially lectured on Chinese culture, etc. Then Cao Yunxiang gave a speech, which is omitted for brevity.</p>
<p>Lecture Started at 3:00 PM: Finally, the chairman introduced Dr. Jiang to meet with all walks of life. At 3:00 PM, he began to lecture in Mandarin on the first chapter of "Introduction to Chinese Culture", "The Origin of the Chinese Nation, Legends Before History". At 4:00 PM, he began to lecture in English. Mr. Jiang's knowledge was profound, and his reasoning was clear. The audience was all attentive. The association prepared tea and snacks during the lecture, and the New New Company Radio Station broadcasted it, so the audience outside could also listen to Mr. Jiang's great discussion.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Law Society of the Republic of China held its founding meeting at the Zhonghua Xueyi Du on Amars Road in the French Concession at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 100 members attended. Tan Zhen, Xu Yuanhao, Shen Junru, Guo Wei, Jiang Yiping, etc. were publicly elected as the presidium, and Yuan Dingxin was the recorder. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Situation</p>
<p>After performing the ceremony, Chairman Tan Zhen reported on the preparations. Then, Lu Jingshi, the representative of the Municipal Party Department, gave a speech, briefly saying that the resolutions of the National Judicial Conference last year should be gradually implemented by the judicial authorities, and the Law Society organized by celebrities from all walks of life has the responsibility to supervise them. The abolition of consular jurisdiction is also an urgent matter. He also hoped that the society would conduct practical research. In short, the society has a major responsibility for the improvement of the judiciary, and it must achieve the rule of law advocated by the Three People's Principles, which is what is expected. Jiang Jianbai, the representative of the Education Bureau, gave a training speech, briefly saying that there are many social organizations, but very few have achieved results. The reason for this is probably that a group of people participate in a group at the beginning, and do not recognize the obligations that members should have. For example, academic groups should study academics, so that there is no contribution after joining the group, and even the meetings of the affiliated associations are not attended. This is a common problem for a group of people. He hoped that the society would eliminate this problem, work hard to promote the rule of law, and to establish a country under the rule of law, it is necessary to make all the people of the country know the law, etc.</p>
<p>Tan Zhen's Speech</p>
<p>Tan Zhen, the representative of the general society, gave a speech, briefly saying that in modern times, the judicial examinations are advocated and the social sciences are greatly despised. In fact, the social sciences are very related to the national politics and should be given equal importance. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, most of the laws in our country have been copied from foreign countries, so there is a criticism of cutting the feet to fit the shoes. We should carry forward the inherent national spirit of our country and not copy foreign countries. The legal system in China is very complicated now. There are Continental factions, Anglo-American factions, etc. We should establish a legal system and carry forward the spirit of our nation. I traveled to France for a year and was very impressed with the French Law Society. The French Law Society initially had only a few members, but now it has more than 170,000 members, which has a great contribution to politics. I hope that this society will make a contribution to the entire politics.</p>

<p>March 1st Still at the Civic Education Center The Confucius Society of this city, which was originally scheduled to hold the founding meeting at the Municipal People's Education Center on Confucius Temple Road at 2:00 PM yesterday, was temporarily postponed to 2:00 PM on March 1st due to some reason, still to be held at the center. The alumni of Zhonggong yesterday celebrated the 70th birthday of Cai Yuanpei</p>
<p>Dagong Society said that the alumni of China Public School celebrated the 70th birthday of Cai Ziming, the chairman of the school board, at the Youth Association on Eight Immortals Bridge at noon yesterday. Wu Jize, Guo Xuzhong, Long Yingjie, Luo Yiwen, Mao Fangmei, Shui Xiangyi, Sun Zhentian, Yao Zhaoli, Nie Haifan, Zhou Xianchu, Liu Liang, Jin Zhan, Chen Songmao, Huang Yaqiang, Fan Caicong, and school directors Zhu Yingpeng, Zou Shengdi, etc., more than 60 people in total, attended. The arrangement of the birthday hall was simple and solemn. When Mr. Cai arrived, everyone stood up and applauded to welcome him. The scene was very enthusiastic. The alumni association representative delivered a congratulatory speech on the spot, briefly saying that Chairman Cai is not only a veteran of the party and the country, but also a leader in the academic world of our country. His morality and writing are well-known throughout the country. He is especially sincere in maintaining the alma mater. Fortunately, he has reached the age of seventy. We wish him good health and longevity for the country and eternal happiness for the country. Then Mr. Cai replied, briefly saying that Zhonggong is a school with a long history and has a deep relationship with the party and the country. Since the school building was destroyed on "January 28", it has not been restored to its former appearance. Thinking of the hard work of the pioneers who founded the school at that time, it is really emotional. Today, we gather together to celebrate my humble birthday, which is really undeserved. I hope to take this opportunity to discuss the vision for the revival of the alma mater, so as to lay the foundation of the school on the rock, then the China Public School will last forever, and wish you all good health. At the end, everyone took a photo together. The alumni association also presented Mr. Cai with a large silver shield of "Ludian Lingguang" to commemorate him.

<p>— Original by LouisaM, Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>After the sweeping work was done, he transported many carts of small wooden strips from the forest to the woodshed, and earned another dollar. Then Xiaobiao helped bind textbooks, worked overnight, and worked patiently and independently on each book under the guidance of Fu Lang. Later, he received his salary and was very satisfied. The crumpled banknote seemed to have a kind of brilliance in his eyes.</p>
<p>"Now, I have a dollar for each of them. I like to give the money to my mother myself, so she can see that I remember my father."</p>
<p>So Xiaobiao reverently paid a visit to his mother, who accepted his small savings as a priceless treasure. She wanted to treasure it and not move it easily, but Xiaobiao begged her to buy some useful items for herself and the girls - who he felt were entrusted to him to take care of - so she couldn't help but agree to his request.</p>
<p>This made him extremely satisfied. Later, although he sometimes temporarily shed his burden, the desire to help still existed and increased with age. He often said the words "my father" with a slightly boastful tone, and also often said, as if he was asking for a glorious title, "Don't call me Xiaobiao anymore. I am already John Brooke." With such a strong ambition and ardent hope, the ten-year-old boy began his struggling career, and inherited his legacy - the gentle thoughts of a clever and gentle father, and the legacy of an immortal reputation"...(End of this chapter)</p>

<p>(Hankou Correspondence) The Hubei Provincial Department of Education, having received a telegram from President Chiang stating that public physical education should be vigorously promoted, and that all civil servants in government agencies and faculty members in schools should select a sport or recreational activity to achieve universality, the Director of the Department, Cheng Qibao, upon receiving the order, drafted the "Outline of Measures for the Universal Implementation of Physical Education in Hubei Province." After being approved by the Provincial Government for record, it was circulated for compliance. The measures are divided into eleven articles: Government agencies and schools should organize after-work or after-school sports associations to handle the implementation of sports for employees of their respective agencies and faculty members of their respective schools. However, if the number of employees or faculty members in an agency or school is too small, they may merge with other agencies or schools in the same area. Individual sports may be promoted by the agency or school. The head of each agency and the principal of each school shall serve as the president of the aforementioned sports association, supervising the implementation of physical education by their respective employees or faculty members. The Provincial Sports Promotion Committee will send personnel to assess the implementation at any time. Those over the age of sixty may be excused from participation at their discretion. Wuchang and Hankou should appropriately add sports fields. Counties that have not yet established them should promptly establish them in accordance with the Provisional Rules for the Establishment of Sports Fields in Various Counties and Equipment Standards previously set by the Department of Education. To facilitate practice in both winter and summer, fitness rooms and swimming pools should be built in the Wuhan area as soon as possible. County governments in other counties should also prepare to build all-weather playing fields in their respective counties. Employees of government agencies and faculty members of schools must select one of the following sports for daily practice after work or after school: A. Ball sports, temporarily limited to soccer and basketball; B. Track and field; C. National martial arts; D. Equestrian archery; E. Calisthenics; F. Swimming; G. Recreation, temporarily set as ping-pong, shuttlecock kicking, rope skipping, bicycle practice, and fitness dance. Employees of government agencies and faculty members of schools who are skilled in sports must take turns providing guidance to other members of the public in sports at least twice a week for a reasonable amount of time. In order to review the results of the implementation of physical education throughout the province, the Provincial Government will hold a provincial sports meet every May, with each administrative region as a unit. Each region will hold a regional sports meet one month prior, with each county as a unit. The preliminary selection methods below the district level will be determined by each district based on the actual conditions of the counties under its jurisdiction. All sports fields and public education centers must hold various sports or recreational competitions according to the season. All government agencies and schools should jointly or individually hold various sports competitions. If there is no suitable equipment, they may use the existing public sports fields in the same area and may entrust the person in charge of the field to assist with everything. All government agencies and schools should utilize their existing staff or faculty members with sports experience and expertise to guide practice. If there are no such personnel available, other suitable personnel may be hired. In order to universally train teachers, the Department of Education may, during the summer vacation each year, utilize the facilities of the Provincial Public Sports Field to run summer sports training classes. Personnel from various agencies will be sent to attend the classes, and upon completion, they will return to their original agencies to take charge of sports guidance and improvement matters.

<h3 id="e151">From Bank Interest Rates to the Issue of Interest Rate Reduction <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Kezhong</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>Since the business community petitioned the Ministry of Finance to reduce interest rates to alleviate the difficulties of industries, this issue has attracted widespread attention. However, to reduce lending rates, the prerequisite is the reduction of deposit rates, as the net interest earned by the banking industry comes from the difference between deposit and lending rates. A January 17th report stated that the banking industry will form a committee to specifically study the reduction of interest rates, stating:</p>
<p>"Banks' lending comes from absorbing deposits. If lending rates are reduced without reducing deposit rates, it will be impossible to operate. The current deposit rates... foreign banks' highest is about 5%, Chinese banks' highest is about 1% annual interest, and pawnshops' highest is about 1% monthly interest. As for lending rates, foreign banks, Chinese banks, and pawnshops' lowest is about 6%, and highest is about 1.2-3%, depending on the market's money supply. If implemented, there should be remedies for existing deposits and loans."</p>
<p>From the above situation, we can see that the banking industry is completely seeking the reduction of lending rates from the perspective of its own interests. In other words, reducing interest rates to ease the burden on industries is indeed desirable, but they cannot sacrifice their own interests. Therefore, they have no other choice but to seek a reduction in the interest rates of deposits, which are the source of 90% of their funds. As a result, the banking industry acts as an intermediary (or brokerage industry), seeking the completion of transactions between borrowers and lenders while enjoying commissions. However, in the situation where deposits are used by banking entrepreneurs for speculation, the banking industry must devise an appropriate method to satisfy depositors. Therefore, reducing interest rates is easy to say when industries are eagerly hoping for it, but it is not easy to implement in the banking industry. The following is a description of the general situation of interest rates of various banks in Shanghai, followed by a study of strategies for reduction.</p>
<p>II. Overview of Bank Interest Rates</p>
<p>Bank interest rates can be divided into two major categories: deposit and lending. Deposit rates can be further divided into ordinary deposit rates and savings deposit rates. They are described as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Ordinary Deposits</p>
<p>Time Deposits: This type of deposit is represented by 18 banks including Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, China Enterprise Bank, China Industrial Bank, Yongxiang Bank, Zhongfu Bank, China Bank, China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Siming Bank, Kenye Bank, Juxingcheng Bank, China Industrial Bank, Zhonghui Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, China National Products Bank, Hengli Bank, and Guohua Bank. The period ranges from three months to five years. The highest interest rate is 1.2% per annum, and the lowest is 4% per annum. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Period　Highest　Lowest　Average</p>
<p>Demand Deposits: This type of deposit is represented by 10 banks including Bank of Communications, Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, Zhonghui Bank, Kenye Bank, Siming Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Tongshang Bank, Shanghai Women's Bank, and China Enterprise Bank. The highest interest rate is 4% per annum, but due to interest rate increases, it can also be as high as 5%. The lowest is 2%. Two banks offer 2%, five banks offer 3%, and three banks offer 4%.</p>
<p>(B) Savings Deposits</p>
<p>Various banks have many different names for savings deposits. In fact, they cannot be distinguished by fixed-term or demand deposits and must be classified according to the different deposit and withdrawal methods. The four most important types are described below.</p>
<p>Fixed Deposit with Zero Withdrawal: This type of deposit is represented by 20 banks including China Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai Bank, Yanyue Bank, Siming Bank, Xinhua Bank, Donglai Bank, Dalu Bank, Guohua Bank, Kenye Bank, Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Zhonghui Bank, Quangong Bank, China Enterprise Bank, Hengli Bank, Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, China National Products Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Jiangsu Bank, and Tongshang Bank. The minimum term is one year, and the maximum term is more than ten years. The lowest interest rate is 5% per annum, and the highest is 1.2% per annum. Details are shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Zero Deposit with Fixed Withdrawal: This type of deposit is represented by 23 banks including China Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai Bank, Yanyue Bank, Siming Bank, Jincheng Bank, Xinhua Bank, Donglai Bank, Dalu Bank, China Industrial Bank, Guohua Bank, China Kenye Bank, Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Juxingcheng Bank, Zhonghui Bank, China Enterprise Bank, Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, Jiangsu-Zhejiang Bank, China National Products Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Jiangsu Bank, and Tongshang Bank. The term is the same as the above, and the interest rate is a minimum of 6% and a maximum of 1.2%. Details are shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Deposit Principal with Interest Payments: This type of deposit is represented by 22 banks including China Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai Bank, Yanyue Bank, Zhongfu Bank, Siming Bank, Jincheng Bank, Xinhua Bank, Dalu Bank, Guohua Bank, Kenye Bank, Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Juxingcheng Bank, Zhonghui Bank, China Enterprise Bank, Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, Jiangsu-Zhejiang Bank, China National Products Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Jiangsu Bank, and Tongshang Bank. The length of the term is the same as the above two, and the interest rate is a minimum of 6% and a maximum of 1.1%. Details are shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Fixed Deposit with Fixed Withdrawal: This type of deposit is represented by 17 banks including China Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai Bank, Zhongfu Bank, Jincheng Bank, Xinhua Bank, Dalu Bank, Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Juxingcheng Bank, Quangong Bank, China Enterprise Bank, Hengli Bank, China National Products Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Jiangsu Bank, and Tongshang Bank. The time ranges from a minimum of three months to a maximum of more than ten years. The interest rate is a minimum of 5% and a maximum of 1.2%. Details are shown in the following table.</p>
<p>The above tables are based on statistics from the deposit regulations of exchange banks. The division of the length of the term is entirely based on facilitating statistics. In fact, the term limits of various banks are either stipulated to be over ten years or within ten years. Therefore, the highest and lowest interest rates in some tables do not increase with the lengthening of the term. The average is also affected by this. However, in general, they all comply with the principle that the term and interest rate are directly proportional.</p>
<p>Lending Rates</p>
<p>There are no fixed rules and regulations for the lending rates of various banks that can be statistically analyzed, because the level of interest rates depends entirely on the tightness of the financial market, the borrower's determination of the amount of capital value, the presence or absence of competition, the strength of payment ability, and the safety of the investment. The data obtained from the survey is listed in the following table:</p>
<p>Except for Bank of Communications, which did not indicate annual or monthly interest, and Zhejiang Industrial, which indicated annual interest, all others are monthly interest. If converted to annual interest, the minimum is 8.4% and the maximum is 1.44%. Although lending rates are determined at any time based on customer conditions and financial market conditions, it is worth studying what the highest and lowest lending rates of banks are in practice. The following data are compiled from the Zhonghang Monthly (August 24th) and the Financial Weekly of the Central Bank (various issues this year):</p>
<p>Agency　Loan Name　Interest Rate</p>
<p>Huai River Guidance Committee　Huai River Guidance Loan　6% per annum</p>
<p>Construction Committee　Jiangnan Railway Loan　8%</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province　Construction Loan　9% per annum</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province Warehouse Construction Loan　7.5% per annum</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province Water Conservancy Public Bond Loan　8% per annum</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province　Silkworm Seed Loan　10% per annum</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province　Huai River Guidance Continued Loan　8% per annum</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province　Highway Loan　9% per annum</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province　Autumn Tax Loan　10% per annum</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province　Local Public Bond Loan　8% per annum</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province　Local Public Bond Continued Loan　10% per annum</p>
<p>Hubei Province　Flood Disaster Public Bond Loan　9%</p>
<p>Shaanxi Province　Wei River Diversion Loan　8% monthly interest</p>
<p>The interest rates listed in the above table are all for government agencies' loans, which can only be used as our reference. It is impossible to search for and statistically analyze the interest rates for loans to industries.</p>
<p>Looking at the above tables, the high deposit rates of banks in our country far exceed the 1% mentioned in the 17th report. Those with a one-year term reach 1% per annum, and those with a three-year term reach 1.2% per annum. With deposit rates so high, it is appropriate that lending rates also reach 1.2% per month. A recent report quoted a certain person in the financial community as saying that banks absorb deposits at high interest rates and speculate in foreign exchange and public bonds, which are profitable and have simple procedures, unlike investing in industries, which requires investigation and research and is less profitable and more complicated. In a few words, the attitude of the banking community is fully depicted.</p>
<p>If the banking industry in our country continues to plan for its own interests, absorbs deposits at high interest rates to engage in speculative activities, there is no need to reduce interest rates - and it is fundamentally impossible. If it embraces the spirit of co-existence and co-prosperity, it should automatically reduce interest rates without waiting for the industries to call for it, so that the industries can have access to low-interest capital.</p>
<p>III. Standard Highest and Lowest Interest Rates</p>
<p>The level of interest rates does not need to be restricted, and its trend depends entirely on the financial season and the demand between borrowers and lenders. If interest rates must be limited by laws and regulations, it is mostly an improper intervention in creditors, and the result may only cut off the financing channels for those who lack capital. Moreover, who can give up where interest lies? In fact, it is also difficult to take effect. Therefore, the so-called standard high and low interest rates in this section have two meanings: one is to prohibit absorbing deposits at high interest rates, and the other is the highest standard for lending rates. The level of interest rates must also depend on the level of domestic civilization. If the level of civilization is high, the people's knowledge will be advanced, the financial institutions will be complete, and people will not suffer from high interest rates. If the opposite is true, people will suffer from high interest rates. Our country's education bureau has not been popularized, and there is a traditional high-interest loan system. In addition, banks have absorbed deposits at high interest rates in recent years, so in fact, an appropriate interest rate must be set as a transitional measure. Secondly, the current lending rates in our country are also quite inconsistent. For example, the interest rates for loans to government agencies are as low as 6% per annum and as high as 1% per annum, while the interest rates of various banks obtained from the survey are mostly 8% to 1.2% per month. Secondly, the industries are now demanding a reduction in interest rates, so the degree of reduction must also have a limit at present, so that both can benefit. For these two reasons, it is impossible not to set a standard highest and lowest interest rate.</p>
<p>However, this standard is quite difficult to formulate, as it is feared that it will be too low or too high. Based on the average situation of the above tables, the following high and low interest rates are drafted:</p>
<p>(1) Ordinary Deposit Rates: The nature of this type of deposit is different from that of savings deposits, and the interest rate should be lower. The highest standard is set as shown in the table:</p>
<p>Term　One Year　Two Years　Three Years　Four Years　Five Years</p>
<p>Interest Rate　6.00%　6.％　6.0％　6.7％　7.00%</p>
<p>(2) Savings Deposit Rates: The trend of the above averages is that the increase in the early years is faster than in the later years. This table is also the same, and the highest standard is set as shown in the table:</p>
<p>Term　One Year　Two Years　Three Years　Four Years　Five Years</p>
<p>Interest Rate　6.00%　6.50%　7.00%　7.23%　7.5%</p>
<p>Six Years　Seven Years　Eight Years　Nine Years　Ten Years　Ten Years or More</p>
<p>7.75%　8.00%　8.25%　8.50%　8.75%　9.00%</p>
<p>(3) Lending Rates: A. 6% to 8% monthly interest; B. 5% to 7% monthly interest.</p>
<p>Deposit rates are generally based on one year. The rates for those within one year can be determined by the banks themselves, but the highest cannot exceed 6% for those with a term of nine months. Also, only the highest is set and not the lowest, because the current issue is a reduction problem, and it is not necessary.</p>
<p>As for lending rates, it is heard that a certain bank is only offering 5% monthly interest for special collateral loans to help industry and commerce. Also, according to the book "Operating Standards for Cotton Spinning Mills" published by the Cotton Industry Control Committee of the National Economic Commission, the interest expense is set at 7% or 8% per annum. Therefore, drafting the lending rate at 5% to 8% monthly interest is probably not too high or too low. However, this standard is still much higher than that of various advanced countries.</p>
<p>IV. Measures to Implement Interest Rate Reduction</p>
<p>The problem that arises in implementing interest rate reduction is not in the lending rate, but in the deposit rate, and in fact, it is even more in the attitude of the banking community. Because there is no problem with deposits and loans that have not been established during implementation, the problem lies in the remedial measures for established deposits and loans. Should we handle them according to the original agreement? Or should we revise the new agreement? If we follow the first rule, the bank will not prevent depositors from withdrawing and can safely use their funds. However, future lending can only be lent at low interest, and as a result, the bank may lose money. The first method is beneficial to the bank in preventing withdrawals, but high-interest absorption and low-interest lending are harmful to the bank. If we follow the second rule, the bank will inevitably face the withdrawal of depositors, but with low deposit interest and low lending interest, the bank can make a profit. The second method is harmful to the bank in terms of depositors' withdrawals, but low-interest absorption and low-interest lending are beneficial to the bank. It seems that the two methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. In fact, I think it is better to revise the new agreement. Why? Depositors will not necessarily withdraw. Because:</p>
<p>If bank interest rates are reduced uniformly, if you deposit in Bank A at this interest rate, you will also deposit in Bank B at this interest rate, and there will be no special treatment.</p>
<p>If you deposit in a merchant, the depositor's confidence in the merchant is not as strong as in the bank. The level of interest rate does not outweigh the safety of investment.</p>
<p>If you deposit in a foreign bank, the bankruptcy of foreign banks has been reported from time to time in recent years, and many Chinese people have suffered, which is not enough to inspire confidence among the Chinese people.</p>
<p>If you deposit to invest in real estate bonds, depositors who can invest in these two will never deposit the funds in the bank. Depositors who deposit in the bank have no great interest in investing in real estate bonds. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>Therefore, in my opinion, it is better to handle all old and new deposits and loans in accordance with the new standards.</p>
<p>V. Conclusion</p>
<p>Reducing interest rates to help industry and commerce is undoubtedly important. However, there are several issues that should be paid attention to after implementation, one is the general prohibition of high interest rates, and the other is the strict prevention of speculation. With regard to the former, there are currently many general stores, small companies, and small banks that offer 1% monthly interest for deposits with a one-year term, and it is inevitable that people will be confused by the high interest rates and forget the risks and fall into them. Therefore, it is necessary to strictly prohibit it. With regard to the latter, not only must the speculation of the banking industry be prohibited, but also the speculation of industry and commerce must be absolutely prohibited. The high interest rate is entirely due to the very high profits of speculation. If the speculation is popular, the banking industry will not hesitate to raise interest rates to engage in speculation, and as a result, the lending rates for industry and commerce will naturally be high. Therefore, speculation must be strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>I have no in-depth study of banking practice. This article is entirely based on the perspective of statistics to study the reduction of interest rates. Whether it is appropriate or not is still subject to experts' corrections.</p>
<h3 id="e152">The Benefits of Establishing a Central Land Bank <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Angong</p>
<p>My previous suggestion to the central government to establish a Central Land Bank to promote China's land reform movement and develop China's land economy and credit has been adopted and passed at the Fifth Plenary Session. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Interior have been instructed to handle the matter. I am deeply impressed! Although preparations for the Central Land Bank have been reported in the newspapers, when will we see the reality? What is the preparation plan? Will it be carried out entirely according to my suggestions, or will there be changes? So far, nothing has been heard. The establishment of the Central Land Bank is a new initiative for the country and society. It lacks established laws to follow and experience to draw on. Undertaking such a major and difficult task, if not done carefully, could have adverse effects. Therefore, I venture to offer a word as a warning.</p>
<p>I believe that the establishment of the Central Land Bank is not only to establish a new foundation for China's land reform movement. From the perspective of the national finances, the establishment of the Central Land Bank can first realize the new trend of creating capital by monetizing China's real estate. Secondly, it can discover a vast source of land credit capital that is inexhaustible in China's extremely weak and depleted financial resources. Thirdly, it can make agricultural financial activities easier to carry out, improve land, thereby rapidly increase land value, and promote agricultural production and industrial construction. All of these, directly and indirectly, are sufficient to increase government tax revenue and open up huge financial sources. Finally, the Ministry of Finance can establish this type of bank without raising a large amount of capital, but instead reap the creation of huge and stable capital. Therefore, I believe that the establishment of a land bank is not only a plan to reform China's land, but also a major plan to transform China's finances.</p>
<p>As for the establishment of the Central Land Bank, as mentioned earlier, it is an unprecedented initiative. Its organization is also very different from ordinary industrial and commercial banks. Moreover, specialized talents for this type of land bank are rare in China. Even Japan has not yet established a land bank. In this situation, how can the organization of the land bank give full play to its various strengths and functions? How should land bonds be issued? To what extent should the amount of land bonds issued be equivalent to the real needs of society? How should the lending system be determined? How should corporate finance be raised? How should practitioners be recruited and trained? All of these issues will be the most difficult problems in the current preparation for the Central Land Bank. These are all prerequisites for the establishment of a land bank, which is what we expect.</p>
<p>Land banks originated and flourished in Germany. The author had a special article introducing them in the local weekly published in the Central Daily News. In other words, Germany is the birthplace of land credit banks. People there have the most significant achievements in the organization, management, and operation of this type of bank, and they have abundant talents and experience. Therefore, the organizational system of land banks there is most worthy of our reference and attention. Therefore, I believe that at the beginning of the preparation of the Central Land Bank, in order to be cautious about the function and application of land banks, and for the sound development of the cause, and for the easy establishment of the bank, it is best to directly send people to Germany to conduct more practical research and investigation, or directly hire one or two German land credit experts to come to China to guide us, so that our country can get help from Mount Tai. Then the cause will be easy to achieve, and at the same time, it can reduce some of the adventurous nature of experimentation. This is also what we expect.</p>
<p>Although what has been said above is only to contribute opinions to the authorities, I believe that the establishment of the Central Land Bank is not only closely related to the government authorities, but also has a great impact on China's banking industry. I am afraid that the banking industry in China does not recognize the cause and effect of this, so I offer a few words for reference. In the past, China's banking system was based on cash reserves. Although this system can be said to be a stable and safe system in theory, in practice, cash is stored dead in the cellar, and useful cash and silver are placed in a useless place. It is not in line with the principle of economics, and it does not need economists to say it. Moreover, when the country is in a difficult diplomatic situation, once an international war breaks out, the bank will be attacked by the enemy, or they will first seize our cash reserves. At this time, although there is circulation of banknotes in the society, it will inevitably be equivalent to empty promises. As a result, on the one hand, it will be enough to cause the collapse of the national financial institutions, and on the other hand, it will inevitably lead to the defeat of wartime finance and put the war in a disadvantageous position. This is because the currency wars (Wahrungskrieg) of various countries have become increasingly fierce in recent years, and the system of using gold and silver is constantly changing. The lack of stability of this currency system is most likely to cause the bankruptcy of the cash reserve system. For example, the United States' change to the gold and silver standard and the implementation of the silver purchase policy immediately triggered a large outflow of silver from our country, causing great danger to the banks in Shanghai. Even American banks went bankrupt because of this. This is a clear indication of the weakness of the cash reserve banking system. Fortunately, since last year, the financial authorities have deeply realized that this system cannot be delayed for a long time, and resolutely promulgated a new plan for currency reform and implemented the legal tender system. This measure has been able to save the weakness of the existing banking system, but it has not been able to achieve a completely thorough reform of the banking cash reserve system. The former is the distribution of reserves, and now it is the concentration of reserves only. In the end, it still needs cash, and it still cannot avoid the various dangers listed above, so it cannot be regarded as a completely new banking system.</p>
<p>However, the land bank system that I suggest can completely abolish the cash reserve system and use land representing the value of capital as a reserve. This kind of land asset reserve cannot be plundered by thieves, nor can it be smuggled by the enemy, and water and fire cannot harm it. Currency wars cannot do anything to it. After the land is used as a bank fund, it can continue to be used and freely produced, completely eliminating the absolute violation of the principle of economics, which is to store cash dead in the cellar and spend insurance money and security costs. This is truly the safest system in the world, and the most economical way. Moreover, China is the country with the weakest and most lacking cash capital. Although there are gold and silver mineral resources in the country's land, there has been a lack of management to set up factories for mining, so it is quite difficult to meet the country's need for gold and silver or to raise funds for large banks. If it comes from borrowing foreign debts, on the one hand, it will promote the power of foreigners to invade China's economy, and on the other hand, it will be subject to high interest rates and harsh political or economic conditions, making China forever a debtor country in the international community. There are too many disadvantages to us to enumerate. Only because of this, China's banking industry will never have the possibility of great development. For example, the largest bank in China now, such as the Central Bank, only has 20 million yuan of capital. However, the national banks of the United Kingdom and the United States all exceed 500 million or 1 billion of capital, which is a world of difference. The reason is that my country's capital is poor, and the cash reserve banking system is not easy to promote. The United Kingdom and the United States have abundant domestic gold and silver production, and cash is sufficient. It is not difficult to gather 100 million or 1 billion of bank capital. This is due to the economic substance of society, not that our intelligence and talent are not as good. On the contrary, if China can now promote the new land bank system, it can completely avoid the aforementioned restrictions and influences of various disadvantages. Especially without begging for foreign aid, it is the most effective way for China to strengthen itself, be self-reliant, self-help, strive, self-sufficient, and save itself. The promotion of the land bank system will never be hindered by China's lack of cash. The capital required by this type of bank is not cash but land. Therefore, the larger the area and value of the land, the easier it is to accumulate the capital of the land bank. My country is the country with the largest land area in the world. If we can organize banks according to this principle, then our country can establish the greatest bank in the world. Taking Shanghai as an example, if we can cooperate to form a land bank with all the real estate in Shanghai, such as the German Stadtschaften, we can get more than 2 billion of land capital. Re-estimating the value of the real estate in Nanjing, it is also a huge amount of more than 1 billion yuan. If we can organize a bank in this way, we can generate the largest bank in the world without begging for a penny of foreign debt. In the past, we did not plan this and abandoned it on the ground, and still said that the country's financial resources are poor. What a mistake! Therefore, in order to improve China's banking organization and open up a way for self-reliance, I deeply hope that the banking industry in China will recognize the characteristics and great functions of the land bank. On the one hand, we should try our best to assist in the preparation of the Central Land Bank. On the other hand, within the possible scope, the banking industry may also organize more of this type of bank to promote the utilization of land credit in China. According to the author's observation, because the organization of a land bank does not require cash as a reserve, a land bank can be organized not only in the city but also in the countryside. The best way is to take the township as a unit and use cooperative methods for all the land in each township, such as organizing it according to the German Landschaften. In this way, there are 300,000 villages in China, which can form 300,000 land cooperative banks. Assuming that the capital of each land bank is 5,000 yuan, then the total land capital in China can be 1.5 billion yuan. In this way, the country can be covered with a bank network, opening up a great way for the development of the banking industry. At the same time, with the relief and circulation of 1.5 billion yuan of land credit in the rural areas, the current extremely serious financial problems in the rural areas can be solved. Only then can the revitalization of the rural areas and the revival of the national movement be expected to achieve true success.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Securities <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>After the Reopening of the Securities Market, Prices Only Saw a Brief Rebound, Falling by About Two to Nine Yuan</p>
<p>From February 17th to 22nd last week, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, after a 16-day closure, finally reopened. After going through various difficulties, there was a sincere fear of a sharp decline after the reopening. After much effort, the Ministry ordered temporary regulations: short sellers were required to deliver the actual goods, new short selling was temporarily suspended, and the existing spot trading in the market was also temporarily suspended. The doors to short selling were completely closed, while those who went long were treated as before. After buying on the same day, selling on the same day was not accepted by the exchange. The above measures to maintain the market were indeed effective. However, brokers had extreme difficulties in settling accounts for customers. It was faintly heard that most of them advised the short side to make up for the losses first, and then the long side could sell. This clever method was used to avoid disputes. However, after the reopening, the market price still plummeted, with great fluctuations. At present, the delivery period is near, and according to the usual practice, there is only one day. The exchange has not yet announced whether it will be extended by one or two days to facilitate the closing. Whether the March futures will be listed, and when the unified public bonds will be auctioned are all uncertain. It is faintly heard that the March futures will not be auctioned, and the unified public bonds will be auctioned in April and May. Whether this is true remains to be verified. At present, the short sellers have all delivered the goods. The strength of the long side is unknown. With banks reducing deposit interest rates and the exchange providing collateral loans, the long side is relatively stable. However, the short side is still confident. The turbulence will only subside after the delivery of the February futures. Last week, the Ministry ordered the reopening on Monday, but the brokers requested various things and failed to open on time. It was delayed until 4:30 pm before the first session was opened. The market price plummeted, falling by about four yuan. However, the suspension board was not displayed, and it was maintained repeatedly. It still plummeted because the market price was too high and did not match the ratio of the unified public bonds. On Tuesday, the exchange issued a notice requiring short sellers to deliver all the actual goods before 12:00 noon. The brokers were very crowded when delivering the goods. The exchange took time to inspect and collect the goods, and it was still delayed until 4:30 pm before another session was opened. The market price was still sluggish, and it fell sharply to the suspension board, a small three yuan or so. Only 20 closed up to four jiao. On Monday, the exchange made up for the short sellers who failed to deliver the actual goods. There were two sessions in the morning and afternoon, and the market price rebounded by one jiao to two yuan or so. On Thursday, the transaction volume decreased significantly, and the full-day four sessions were restored. Because the short sellers delivered the goods, the long side began to sell, and it rebounded by a small number of jiao to one yuan and six jiao. On Friday, the long side continued to come out, and the short side was determined to hold on. Prices fell again, with a fall of two yuan and seven jiao for some, and at least five jiao for others. On Saturday, foreign banks reduced deposit interest rates, and the exchange provided collateral loans at 80% of the value. The long side's line was slightly strengthened, rising by one jiao to one yuan and three jiao. As the date gets closer, the changes are likely to be yet to come. As a result of the week's market price, it fell by seven yuan to nine yuan or so compared to January 29th, which can be said to be a strange change in recent years. The total transaction volume was 48.005 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are listed in the table on the left. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<h3 id="e154">Grain: River Rice Sales Slightly Active <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 20 sources from various gangs, with more than 4,000 shih of goods. On the sales side, since the rainy weather of the previous dynasty, transactions have been scarce. Yesterday, there was a slight movement on the street, with more than 1,000 packages of thin rice and more than 300 packages of thick rice being handled by the Baowei, Longkou, and Qingdao gangs. Therefore, the situation was slightly tight, and the market conditions were good. The price of thick early japonica rice rose by several fen to nearly one jiao, and the price of thin rice increased by five fen to one jiao. Duyang pointed rice increased by about one jiao, and the price of Bianyuan high-quality rice was also good.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 22 or 23 sources from various routes down the river. The market for white japonica rice was slightly more active, and the price rose by several fen. The retail of early thin rice was still acceptable, and the market price increased by nearly one jiao. The retail sales of Yangjian rice were slightly active, and the price increased by about one jiao. Dujian was stable, and the retail sales of Baiyuan and Yinyuan rice continued to be handled, and the price turned tighter by several fen. The prices of other goods also stood firm.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Sugar Market: Actual Sales Were Sluggish, and the Sugar Market Continued to Weaken <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market continued to weaken due to sluggish actual sales. The Association marked the spot price of Grade 24 coarse white sugar at 22.4 yuan, which was slightly lower by 1 jiao compared to the 21st. Although the price of transshipment goods held at the original price of 7.4 yuan, it was heard that the dark market had loosened, and the weakening trend seemed to be continuing. The spot price of East Red Grade 8 white sugar was 22.05 yuan, and the price of transshipment goods was 7.05 yuan, both slightly lower by 5 fen. The quoted price of Grade 9 YRO was the same as before, but the acceptance rate was low, and there were signs of further weakening. The price of the factory's refined white sugar loosened with the price of coarse white sugar, also slightly lower by 1 jiao. The price of Zhenji Grade 1 was 21.2 yuan, Grade 2 was 21 yuan, Grade 3 was 20.8 yuan, Grade 4 was 6 jiao, and Grade 5 was 4 jiao. Although the makers of domestically produced Qingchi sugar insisted on their prices, the sales have been quiet in recent days, and there is a general feeling that it is difficult to rise or fall.</p>
<p>The Inventory of Foreign Sugar in the City Decreased Gradually</p>
<p>(As of February 22nd)</p>
<p>Type of Goods: Current Volume, Compared to Previous Volume</p>
<p>Coarse White Sugar: 17,800, Decreased by 6,485</p>
<p>Dutch Red Sugar: 20,329, Increased by 1,360</p>
<p>Cuban Sugar: 1,620, No Change</p>
<p>Taiche White Sugar: 1,500, Decreased by 100</p>
<p>Finance: Interbank Lending Rates Remained Stable, and Silver Dollars Continued to Decline. The Unofficial Rate Was 12 Jiao, 1 Fen, and 1 Li.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the financial market remained stable. With the week-long closure for accounting and settlement, the market was relatively quiet. Interbank lending rates did not rise or fall, remaining at 7 fen in the morning and afternoon, the same price as the previous day. The turnover of remittance bills was more than 3.6 million in the morning session, and more than 400,000 in new transactions. The turnover in the afternoon session was more than 300,000. The amount of silver dollar settlement bills at money shops was estimated to be more than 35.5 million. The amount of remittances from various routes was estimated to be more than 300,000. The market conditions for subsidiary coins were few and far between. The transaction volume of Jiangnan small silver dollars was 2,000 jiao in the morning session, and the transaction volume of Guangdong small silver dollars was 25,000 jiao. There was no transaction in the afternoon session. The unofficial rate was slightly lower by 4 li compared to the previous day, at 12 jiao, 1 fen, and 1 li. Copper coins remained at 3,003,000 wen, with a transaction volume of 7,878 strings, and 2,600 yuan of legal tender.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Survey: Shanghai Price Index for January <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>According to the report of the National Fixed Tariff Commission, compared with the previous month, the Shanghai wholesale, export, and import price indexes and the Shanghai living expenses index in January of the 25th year all rose slightly except for a slight decrease in imports. Although the foreign exchange market price did not change this month, the overseas silver price plummeted. The Shanghai British Exchange market price was still one shilling, two pence, and three hundred and seventy-five li, while the London silver price fell from two shillings and six pence and four hundred and thirty-seven li in the previous month to two shillings in this month. When the parity of the British exchange is one shilling, four pence and three hundred and thirty-one li, and the foreign exchange was lower than the parity by twelve percent last November, since the collection of silver export tax, balance tax in the 23rd year and the implementation of the legal tender last November, the relationship between our country's prices and overseas silver prices has not been as close as in the past. The reason why the index change this month is still stable is probably due to this.</p>
<p>Wholesale Price Index: The total index was 104.3, an increase of 1.0% compared with the previous month and an increase of 4.9% compared with the same month last year. Compared with the previous month, all the eight types of indexes rose except for a slight decrease in the metal category. The increase in building materials was relatively large, followed by fuel textiles and grains. The increase in the remaining three categories did not exceed 0.8%. The building materials category index increased by 3.9%. The prices of Douglas fir and Liu'an planks both increased due to high overseas prices. The prices of lime, black bricks, etc. were also strong. The fuel category index increased by 1.8%. Firewood rose sharply due to scarce arrivals, and charcoal increased due to the relatively smooth winter sales. The textile category index increased by 1.4%. After the price of white cloth rose month by month from July and August last year, it was slightly fatigued last month. This month, due to insufficient inventory, retailers held firm, and the market price rebounded. The price of white ramie also rose due to slight movements in exports. Various cotton yarns mostly rose due to the purchase of various gangs. However, cotton prices were uniformly weak and fell due to the closure and reduction of work by yarn factories at the end of the old lunar year and the decrease in raw material demand. The grain category index increased by 1.1%. The rise and fall of the rice market were mixed. Although Dumi fell in price due to the surge in arrivals and sluggish sales, foreign rice was firm due to the lack of arrivals and inventories and the increase in reports from the place of origin. Domestic wheat is waiting for new production, and the existing inventory is small, and the factory demand is strong, and the opening price has risen sharply. Flour is expensive due to the cost of raw materials, and the movements of various gangs are endless, and the market is firm. The metal category index fell by 2.9%. Various hardware transactions were even quieter during the settlement period, and sales prices mostly fell.</p>
<p>Export Price Index: The total index was 90.8, an increase of 0.9% compared with the previous month and an increase of 17.6% compared with the same month last year. Compared with the previous month, the three types of indexes, consumer goods, fell slightly, and raw materials and finished products all rose slightly. The consumer goods index fell by 0.1%. The prices of various products rose and fell by half, but the prices of the major exports of red and green tea, egg white, and lard all fell, probably due to sluggish foreign sales. The raw materials index rose by 1.1%. Ramie and coal dust both rose due to demand exceeding supply. The inventory of pig bristles was weak, and Europe and the United States made purchases, and the selling price was super expensive. Yellow soybeans and small tin ore also rose. The finished product index rose by 1.1%. Various warps were uniformly expensive. Asphalt opened at a higher price because foreign companies and soap factories moved in droves. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e158">A Record of the Burial of an Unknown Hero <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Liutang</p>
<p>The tomb of the unknown hero of Shanghai City has been completed, and the unveiling ceremony was held on February 16. Earlier, at 10:00 am on the 9th, the remains of the fallen soldiers were buried near Miaohang, in a place called Sanbai Mudi. The Battle of Miaohang was one of the most intense battles in the Shanghai War. The Japanese army poured in its elite troops, bringing its new-style weapons with them. For a time, our troops suffered many casualties. Afterwards, fresh troops were transferred to succeed them, and the original positions were retaken. On the day of the final retreat of the troops, the Japanese army could not cross the Lei Chi line, which was also a heroic feat.</p>
<p>After the incident, the Shanghai Tongren Fuyuantang searched for the remains and buried them separately. This time, wanting to examine a skeleton from among them and move it to the Tomb of the Unknown Hero, the Shanghai Disabled People's Hospital sent someone to grope and designate it. The person who groped was slightly knowledgeable about astrology and took the matter quite seriously, searching in the dark east and west, and walking north and south. Finally, on the tomb site at the original entrance, he designated a skeleton. There were sixty-seven others buried in the same place, this being one of the sixty-seven coffins.</p>
<p>What is strange is that not all of the coffins are nameless. When the Tongren Fuyuantang buried them, if they encountered a symbol on the chest that could identify the surname and department, they engraved it on the tombstone to prepare for their descendants to come and recognize it. The method was very complete. Only the skeleton designated by the person who groped had no surname that could be examined. What was presented to the eyes when the coffin was opened was a purplish-red skeleton, missing its left arm and left leg. Therefore, it was enshrined in a stone coffin, the coffin was lined with gray powder, a yellow silk mattress was laid, the skeleton was placed on top, and it was covered with a silk quilt. Then the lid was sealed tightly and moved to the Tomb of the Unknown Hero.</p>
<p>There are those who are knowledgeable about feng shui who say that the bones of the deceased are usually gray-white, and those that turn purple must have prosperous descendants. If so, this is also Heaven's way of rewarding loyal souls!</p>
<p>On the day of the unveiling ceremony, in the afternoon, thousands of people went to pay their respects, and the enthusiasm was unprecedented. Many brought tin foil to burn, which shows the depth of their admiration.</p>
<h3 id="e159">The Confucian Temple Park <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>In the past, when going to Nanshi for a stroll, there was only the City God Temple. The incense there was thick, the market sounds were noisy, and those who loved quietness found it a bit too much to bear. Now there is the Confucian Temple Park, which is clean and noble, surpassing the City God Temple by many times. No wonder tourists flock to it. That's right! There are flowers, plants, trees, pavilions, stones, and ponds there, and the scenery is beautifully decorated. Moreover, there are books and newspapers to read, and various models and antiques are displayed, which is enough to broaden your horizons and increase your knowledge. Several friends in the city who love to listen to books can also listen to good books and drink cheap tea when they get inside. So I often joke with my friends, if I lived in Nanshi, I would definitely move near the Confucian Temple and sit there for a few hours in the morning and evening, which would be much more refreshing than being locked in a guest room. Moreover, across the street is the zoo, where you can listen to the birdsong and ape cries, and watch the fish swimming and the beasts jumping, which is also a happy thing. So I don't go to Nanshi often, but when I do, I always go inside for a few hours.</p>
<p>The current Confucian Temple Park is quiet in the midst of the hustle and bustle, and tourists are as thick as crucian carp. But talking about the situation twenty-five years ago is not the same. At that time, the city walls of Shanghai had not yet been demolished, and the traffic between the concession and the city relied on several city gates for entry and exit, which was not very convenient. Especially the area around Ximen was unusually desolate. In the area around the Confucian Temple, not to mention at night, even during the day, few people passed by. At that time, the gate of the Confucian Temple was still an old-fashioned building, with a black lacquered gate painted with deities and a threshold several feet high. Except for the spring and autumn sacrifices, it was always closed all year round. In front of the gate was a screen wall; in front of the gate was a vegetable garden; in the west corner, the Kuixing Pavilion stood tall; in the middle, the Dacheng Hall had moss growing on its four walls; a pool of water was also green all year round. At that time, those who went in only felt a sense of solemnity tinged with desolation. Who would have thought that after a series of reforms, after being converted into a park, the Dacheng Hall is still the Dacheng Hall, the Kuixing Pavilion is still the Kuixing Pavilion, the ponds are still the same, and the trees are unharmed, but the scenery is very different. Culture is evolving and progressing, and I have the same feelings about the present and the past of the Confucian Temple!</p>

<p>Wang Shicheng, seeing that he was being treated very courteously, couldn't very well directly refuse him. He picked up his cup, took a sip, smacked his lips, and said with a smile, "Although Mr. Jia is interested in our piece of land, it's rare for a buyer to contact the sellers like this. Considering our relationship with Mr. Jia, we'll try our best to make this happen." As he spoke, his eyes glanced toward Bei Hai. Bei Hai, holding his wine cup, had a faint smile on his face, clearly not taking Shicheng's words seriously. Jia Duocai silently drank a couple of cups of wine and said to Shicheng with a smile, "I understand this piece of land isn't entirely up to you two, but if you're both willing to contribute some ideas, I think this deal can be made. I won't lie, I really want these two pieces of land, and I hope you two can help me out a bit." Shicheng looked at Bei Hai, smiled for a moment, but didn't say anything. Jia Duocai laughed, "I know the key to all of this lies with Brother Bei Hai alone. If Brother Bei Hai is willing to take on some responsibility, this matter is sure to succeed nine times out of ten." As he spoke, his right hand held the wine pot, and his right elbow leaned on the table as he stared intensely at Bei Hai. Naturally, his face still carried a smile. Bei Hai picked up a salted duck egg with its shell, placed it in front of him, held the eggshell with the index finger of his left hand, and slowly picked at the egg white with his chopsticks. Then he smiled faintly, "Mr. Jia, it's no use putting such a high hat on me. I'm just a clod, and a high hat would just wobble and fall off." Jia Duocai completely forgot to entertain his guests, picked up the wine pot himself, poured himself a cup of wine, tilted his head back, and drank it as if to embolden himself with the wine. As the wine went down, he straightened his chest, put on a serious face, then smiled again, and said in a deep voice, "Brother Bei Hai, you're not married yet, are you? I have some good news for you. That Miss Zhu Yueying, I've... freed her. If Brother Bei Hai is interested, this would be a very good match." Bei Hai slammed his wine cup down, blushed, and stood up, saying, "Mr. Jia, what are you saying? Do you think..." Jia Duocai immediately grabbed him, pressed him down, and said with a laugh! "I've had a couple of extra drinks, so I'm talking a bit loosely. But I think very highly of you, considering you a fine young man, and I'm very willing to be your friend." (406)</p>

<h3 id="e161">A Tour of the Qimei Road Public Housing Village <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four essential elements of life, but in Shanghai, the housing problem is the most difficult to solve. Not only is the environment complex and the air polluted, affecting physical and mental health, but the high cost of rent is a real burden for the general salaried and working classes. However, for the sake of survival, these problems remain unsolved.</p>
<p>Recently, the municipal government, recognizing this situation, built four public housing villages last year on Qimei Road, Zhongshan Road, Damuqiao, and Pushanqiao in the city. The construction of each site has been completed in order, and residents have gradually moved in.</p>
<p>In order to learn more about the conditions in the village, I made a special trip to tour the Qimei Road public housing village one cold morning. The village is located on the small side of the second bridge on Qimei Road, facing the sun, so it is quite warm. There are two entrances, similar in style to the gates of a public school or campus. In the center are the auditorium, the office, and the reading room. The buildings are in a herringbone shape, with two flagpoles in front of the door, each displaying a banner, as well as a newspaper board and a bulletin board. Across from them is a square that serves as a sports field. The village has a total of 260 houses, divided into types A and B. Type A costs three yuan, and Type B costs four yuan. The structure of the houses is extremely simple and tidy. Each house is connected to a maximum of five or six families, with space left in front, behind, and on both sides for planting flowers and trees. Not only is there ample light and air circulation inside, but also, because fire hydrants and water dragons are set up everywhere, it is very safe. Each of the four corners of the village has a public toilet and a tap water pool. Each tap water pool is divided into more than ten compartments, each equipped with a tap. Next to it is a cement washing platform more than ten feet long, where more than ten people can wash things at the same time. The roads in the village are all paved with cement, and streetlights are installed at every corner. At night, there are police officers patrolling the village all night, so the villagers can live in peace.</p>
<p>Behind the auditorium is a consumer cooperative, which, in addition to supplying daily necessities, also has men's and women's bathrooms, as well as a public tea garden. Finally, there is the women's toilet.</p>
<p>There is a small school in the village, with an attached kindergarten. Children of villagers aged four to eight can enter the kindergarten, and those aged eight to sixteen can enter the primary school section. Tuition is completely free; only the cost of books is charged.</p>
<p>The equipment and organization of the village are very strict and tidy. All the living equipment in each house, such as electric lights and stoves, are installed completely by them. Residents only need to move in some movable furniture, without having to bother themselves.</p>
<p>Type A houses have one main room, one small back room, and one small kitchen. The clothes rack is installed in front of the door. Type B has two main rooms, one in front and one in the back, a small connecting room, and a small back room. It is very suitable for couples and small families with one or two children to live in.</p>
<p>I toured the village for more than two hours, and saw many villagers living and working leisurely, and the cleaner was cleaning up in every place.</p>
<p>The village faces south, with a bamboo fence wall in front of it and a river behind it. It is surrounded by fields, so every house gets sunlight.</p>
<p>"It's truly a small paradise outside the city!" I thought as I reluctantly walked back home.</p>

<p>— (Zhan Ruoye)</p>
<p>A friend is down on his luck in Jingkou and often sighs with emotion. One day, he wrote, "Seeing people on the streets crying from hunger and cold, I can't help but think of taking a step back." If one can take another step back, that would be true wisdom.</p>
<p>"White clouds seal the stone cave, tame deer nibble flowers, spring has leftovers; red rain moistens the pearl curtain, celestial birds brush trees, the ground is without dust." One need not have this realm, but reading about it is already intoxicating. Mr. Shou Juan's "Stepping on Yellow Mountain stones, one becomes a carefree immortal. Sitting on a pine-needle cushion, sleeping for a thousand years" shows that a blessed land need not be sought in heaven; it requires a wise heart to appreciate it.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Speaking and Striking the Bell <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Haike</p>
<p>Once, I visited Mr. Hu Zhantang with Fo Chang and saw a couplet written by the famous calligrapher Ma Gongyu hanging in his guest room. The couplet read: "Say what should be said at the right time, strike the bell as a monk should every day." Fo Chang jokingly asked: "Why do you hang this couplet, aren't you appointing yourself as passive? The state is like this, we should untie our hair and tie our caps in rage, who would dare to be late?" He answered: "The meaning of this couplet is precisely to be proactive and responsible, how can you call it passive? People nowadays should speak but don't, should strike the bell but don't, which is why the state affairs are getting worse every day. If one can speak in time, the words will be accurate; if one can strike the bell on time every day, nothing will be left undone. The reason why foreign countries are strong is only because everyone can speak and strike the bell." His words hit the current ills and are thought-provoking, so I record them to be a warning to the nation.</p>

<p>— Sun Linchang</p>
<p>The international situation is gloomy on all sides, and the city is full of storms, giving the impression that something is about to happen. Thus, the "female heroes" of various countries are eager to get started and are engaging in major activities, so I am writing "A Study of the Women's Army".</p>

<p>— Xianghong</p>
<p>Niangzi is a common term for young women, and women who join the army are called the Women's Army. This originates from the Tang Dynasty, "Princess Pingyang married Chai Shao. When Gaozu first raised troops, Shao distributed his family wealth and recruited deserters across the river. The Princess led an elite force of more than ten thousand and met with the Prince of Qin north of the Wei River. Shao and the Princess each set up their own headquarters and were called the Women's Army." See the Tang Shu. Also, the Youxue Qionglin states: "The army is called Niangzi, auspicious and difficult to destroy." Today, the common people use the term Women's Army to describe women uniting and using force. For example, if a husband has an affair, his shrewish wife, due to chemical reactions, invites her girlfriends to argue. Writers often say: "The Women's Army launches a punitive expedition."</p>
<h3 id="e166">The Three Religions and Nine Classes <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Yilu</p>
<p>The phrase "three religions and nine classes" is something we often hear. But exactly what are the three religions and the nine classes? Perhaps not many people know. According to my friend: the three religions, of course, refer to Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism! The nine classes, however, are divided into upper, middle, and lower classes. The upper nine classes are: 1. Emperors; 2. Sages; 3. Hermits; 4. Immortals; 5. Scholars; 6. Warriors; 7. Artisans; 8. Merchants; 9. Farmers. The middle nine classes are: 1. Candidates in the Imperial Examinations; 2. Doctors; 3. Fortune Tellers; 4. Jinpi (medicine peddlers); 5. Painters; 6. Artists; 7. Monks; 8. Taoists; 9. Those skilled in qin and chess. The lower nine classes are: 1. Prison Guards; 2. Yamen Runners; 3. Weighers; 4. Nuns; 5. Matchmakers; 6. Miscellaneous Performers; 7. Those who trade in stolen goods; 8. Thieves; 9. Prostitutes. The Jinpi of the middle nine classes refers to those who tell fortunes and sell herbal medicine, and those who trade in stolen goods in the lower nine classes refers to those who buy stolen goods. But whether there are any errors or not, I still have to ask those with better knowledge!</p>

<h3 id="e168">Starting from the "Eating, Drinking, and Merrymaking Case" <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Menglan</p>
<p>Xu Qizhong, the son of the wealthy Wuxing merchant Xu Guannan, declared bankruptcy in the First Special District Court because he owed 31,000 yuan in "dance fees," "meal expenses," "travel car expenses," "fashion," and "cosmetics," and could not repay it. The court managed the case and convened a creditors' meeting at 4:00 p.m. on the 16th. Those who attended included "dance hall managers" and "brothel owners," which can be said to be a grand spectacle.</p>
<p>Not long ago, three "wealthy" college students in Hangzhou became robbers. Commentators not only lamented that this was a "monstrosity" produced by the cohabitation of a capitalist society and a feudal society, but also regarded it as evidence of educational bankruptcy. Now, unexpectedly, there is a "son of a wealthy merchant" who declared bankruptcy because he could not repay his "eating, drinking, and merrymaking expenses," which is quite similar to the "college students becoming robbers" case.</p>
<p>If we carefully compare the "college students becoming robbers" case with this case, apart from the difference in purpose and means, there is simply no difference in exposing educational bankruptcy and the distorted social structure. So, I will not discuss it here for the time being;</p>
<p>What we see is the backside of this event.</p>
<p>The corruption of the private lives of young people, especially the private lives of urban young people, is an undeniable fact. However, these young people are only a small part of the youth, not the whole. Moreover, there are many reasons why this small part of unmotivated young people are not motivated. For example, Mr. Xu Qizhong was too good in the past and did not have the opportunity to see what the world is like now; while some "sons of wealthy merchants" have witnessed the suffering of the nation over the years and participated in the national salvation movement, but because there are too many obstacles from all sides, and they still have an overly warm home to miss, their innate psychology of seeking ease grows again, and they become more discouraged, thinking that it is better to enjoy themselves to the fullest for a short time than to work hard day and night. Although they know that such enjoyment will not last long, they cannot manage so much. This is also one reason why they "cannot be motivated." In short, Xu Qizhong and the three college students who became robbers are only sacrifices under this unreasonable society.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Old Horse <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Jie</p>
<p>"Dad, the cart is ready, let's get going." The son shouted in the stable.</p>
<p>The mother was sick, and the father and son had no work to do. They discussed all night the night before and decided to sell their old companion at the market today—the old horse that had helped them for seven or eight years. Early in the morning, Dad cooked porridge and served his wife. The son knew that the old horse would not sell for much, and there were many country worms, so as soon as they pulled open the horse's mouth, it would be drooling. He washed the old horse early in the morning, and its dry mane looked smooth. The animal didn't know that it was going to leave its old master today. It stretched its legs comfortably and shook its ears. It had been locked in the stable for a long time. On a sunny day, it would sneak out. It knew what its master meant. It drove the broken old cart and waited quietly for its master to whip it. It would try its best and rush over the mountainside of Dongshan.</p>
<p>The young master patted off the dirt on his body and lit a hand-held lamp. Seeing that the sun had already peeked out from the opposite mountain, he thought it was time to leave earlier. The animal's appearance was not bad, and they might meet a "master" (meaning a foreigner) in the city halfway, so they could sell it for more silver and save the country worm's commission. He didn't care that he hadn't eaten anything today and shouted to his father in the house to set off.</p>
<p>The old man was busy tending to his wife on the sickbed. Just as he picked up the bowl of porridge to swallow it, his son shouted in the stable that the cart was ready. Dad couldn't help but laugh and get angry. He rushed out of the door with the porridge and scolded his son:</p>
<p>"Fool! If we sell this animal, will we father and son pull the empty cart back?"</p>
<p>The son stomped his feet and laughed, hitting his head with his fist. "Dad, then let's sell the broken cart together."</p>
<p>"Hurry up and unload it, drink two bowls of porridge, and let's go!"</p>
<p>The father and son filled their stomachs and set off with the animal when the sun had already risen to the mountainside. The warm spring breeze brushed their faces, and they woke up as if from a dream. They had already spent a winter in that thatched shed. Walking past the waist of Dongshan, Dad looked back at his own thatched shed. The broken cart seemed to have turned into a child's toy and was lying at the stable door. "It's over!" He thought to himself, and slowly walked down Dongshan.</p>
<p>The son led the horse whip and walked in front. The sound of the horse's hooves hitting the stone slope was like a hammer hitting Dad's heart. He remembered when he bought this horse. He had run around the market all day, and the country worm had no good quality. Later, in a teahouse, he met an old cart driver who introduced him to this horse. Its leg bones were narrow, its ears were shaking, and its mane seemed to be oiled and shone with gold stars in the sunlight. He spent thirty-eight taels of silver to buy it and only paid the old cart driver for a bowl of tea. He remembered leading the horse back, walking past Dongshan, and everyone patted it and praised it a few times, as if he had made a fortune. Ma Xingbo even congratulated him! Really, in the past few years, thanks to this animal helping me with a few good errands, otherwise the grass on the graves of the old partner would be as high as my son. Thinking, his pace slowed down.</p>
<p>The son buried his head and only cared about walking. He knew that Dad was not feeling well. This animal had been following Dad for so long, always fed with the best fodder. After a long trip, Dad would not let the horse take on more business. This animal is tired, "Take him to Dongshan to let him run for a while," Dad always told him to take him for two or three days. He watched the animal raise its head to yawn in the sun, and its tail swept up like a beautiful flower. Sometimes it snuggled by his side, and he pulled grass and slowly fed it, as if it were a close brother. Today, because of Mom's illness, he had to sell it. Looking back at Dad, Dad was three or five feet away from him, like this old horse, one step at a time, his eyes fixed on the tips of his own feet.</p>
<p>"Dad, hurry up and get on the road, the sun is rising to the top of your head!"</p>
<p>"Child," Dad lifted his shirt and caught up,</p>
<p>"Do you think this animal still has a buyer?"</p>
<p>"What? Dad doesn't want to sell?"</p>
<p>"It's not that! This is an old horse, do you think anyone wants it!"</p>
<p>"Dad, let's say it again when we get to the market. If no one wants it, let's just let it run free and bring it back."</p>
<p>Dad nodded, and the two quickened their pace to go to the market.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Sinner <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Song Yuan</p>
<p>His mood was so confused, uneasy, and anxious. Although the world in front of him was prosperous and wealthy, the streetcars overtook the rickshaws, and the cars overtook the streetcars from behind in the distance. The stream of people, the tide of people, were crowded on the cement. The windows of the silver shops were filled with gold, silver, pearls, and diamonds; the steamed buns just taken out of the steamer in the small restaurants filled the street with fragrance, hitting his nose; but everything was irrelevant to him, and the fire of hunger was burning in his stomach, but there was no way to satisfy his desires.</p>
<p>Since he boasted in front of his sick wife in the morning, saying, "Don't worry, I will definitely earn some money back today," the courage and ideals he had when he left the house were shattered by the encounters with reality. He had even shamelessly run to the factory gate where he used to work and begged for mercy, "Give me a temporary job, please, save the lives of a family of three." But he saw a ruthless and fierce face, scolding and cursing, "No, devil!" and was chased away by the doorman with a red hat and a stick. If he hadn't run away, he would have been beaten again! He had also run to the dock and saw people who had suffered almost the same fate as him carrying goods on their shoulders. He knew that this was a way to make a living. As long as he was willing to suffer a little, the wages for a day were not less than working in the electrical room in the factory.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Although he felt a little contempt for himself who had the talent to manage electricity, he ran forward without hesitation to join the crowd and enter the warehouse in order to survive. "Pig, little brat!" The whip beside him hit him on the head, and then his shoulder was grabbed. He was grabbed to a distance and kicked with a foot. "What are you doing? Stealing things?" Explanations were useless, explanations were useless. After begging, he was let go because he didn't understand the rules, saying that otherwise he would be taken to the line. Feeling disappointed and resentful towards the heaven that he had previously thought was full of gold to be picked up everywhere—this oriental metropolis—he cursed: "This illusionary hell, you entice tens of thousands of people to run from the countryside, to rush from various cities, but you have set up traps to lure people to their deaths! Destroy it, this murderous and wicked metropolis!" Along the way, he heard the streetcars singing triumphant songs, and the cars shouted mocking slogans, and the stream of people, the tide of people, seemed to be rushing to celebrate the grand parade—demonstrating against the disappointed people like him. He didn't believe that there were no hateful animals in the stream of people who had the same fate as him, and who were confused, uneasy, and anxious like him. But everyone was walking so hastily, as if everyone was a professional and was rushing to the destination where his job was. But he felt that the anxiety had turned into leisure, and he walked slowly, admiring every usable, edible, child-playable, or wife-wearable object on the roadside... Many objects seen in his eyes often aroused his former thoughts, and he cursed himself, "Really silly, why think about it, didn't I have no dreams long ago? When I was in the factory, I still had a share of dreams, but now everything is hopeless, so why am I deceiving myself?" After settling his heart like this, he temporarily felt peace and indifference. He had already reached such a bad fate, and he would be more clear, so there would be less pain. After training himself like this, all shame and arrogance left him, and when he walked to the bridge and saw the little brats "pulling scalpers," he ran forward to earn a few copper coins. "Hey, open your eyes, there's no share for you here!" They united to oppress him and were about to use force. "I have to eat too!" He replied to them, stiffer, and fists and feet had already knocked him to the ground, and blood was flowing from his nose.</p>
<p>Running around like that all day, absent-minded: now it was dark. Night had come, and if he continued to be confused, he would have to sleep on the side of the road, and his wife and brother-in-law would be dying. Night is sinful, but at the same time it gives people more exciting and courageous power, allowing them to satisfy their demands without being noticed, and also to comfort themselves by saying that they are committing crimes in the dark without guilt. Why not learn from what Wang Laosan next door did?</p>
<p>Although he had succeeded and calmly took the leather wallet containing money from the intimidated person into his pocket, he shouted, and the patrol with real weapons caught his hand holding the fake weapons.……</p>

<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>It was a starry summer night. Three days and nights of tossing and turning at sea delivered a weary body and mind to a hostel on a port in South China. Although it was past ten o'clock at night, the weather was still stiflingly hot, causing people to sweat. The room was on the fourth floor facing the street, with a door opening onto the street and a small balcony built on a cantilever. Iron railings surrounded both sides, where two pots of flowers were placed, one jasmine and one Arabian jasmine. Standing on the balcony, a refreshing sea breeze blew in from the south, much cooler than inside the room.</p>
<p>This port can be considered a relatively prosperous commercial port in South China. The buildings are all four or five stories high. However, material conditions ultimately limit its development, and rickshaws are still the main means of transportation in the city streets. Cars are rarely seen. After nightfall, the shops close their iron shutter doors, and people put on light casual clothes, strolling leisurely, dragging their wooden clogs from one street to another, teasing the street singers. The sound of the wooden clogs on the cement street is like the croaking of frogs in the paddy fields after a summer rain. Travelers from the north find it very fresh and interesting. When the sound of the wooden clogs gradually fades away, the street becomes quiet, and then you can hear the quivering voices and licentious melodies flowing from the windows of the singing halls and hostels. These voices and melodies embellish the prosperous scene of this South China port.</p>
<p>The balcony of my room, although facing the street, actually faced an alleyway connecting the outer street to the inner street. Both sides of the alleyway were residential buildings, and one or two pedestrians occasionally walked by under the dim and weak alley lights. The black lacquered doors on both sides were tightly closed, creating a strangely quiet scene. Suddenly, with a "ding-dong" sound, a brightly painted car with a gorgeously dressed beauty leaning against it appeared at the corner of the alleyway, vaguely discernible. Then, with another "ding-dong" sound, both the car and the shadow disappeared into the darkness at the front of the alley. This fleeting, beautiful, and ethereal picture deeply stirred the heart of the weary wanderer, who lay on the velvet couch and dreamt a scarlet dream. Only after the songs and melodies from the distant upper floors penetrated the walls and reached my ears did I feel a sense of loss.</p>
<p>It was a moonlit night in early autumn. The only large city in South China had sunk into the stillness of sleep. The moonlight, like water, shone brightly on the locust trees by the street. The silhouette of Yuexiu Mountain in the east slept like a blue velvet ball, and the streetlights on the mountainside flickered like inlaid beads. Although it was autumn, there was no hint of coolness. I was sick, staying in a hospital room on the third floor, with the window facing the south side of the road. At that time, the moonlight poured in through the window, and the hallway was completely silent. I couldn't sleep, and my heart was thinking of home and my beloved family. Just as I was feeling lost and confused, a faint and sorrowful flute sound floated into the window. The clear but not agitated melody, accompanied by the middle-aged singing of a woman, was full of the emotions of South China: poignant, sorrowful, and moving. I almost wept as I listened.</p>
<p>Supporting my weak body, forgetting that I was a patient who couldn't withstand the night wind and dew, I leaned against the window. Under the clear moonlight, I could clearly see the thin shadows of two people, stepping on the shadows of the locust trees, walking towards the window. A flute sound, a song, in the cold midnight, they were seeking someone with a kind heart to throw down one or two copper coins from the window.</p>
<p>I sighed and finally shed tears.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Spring Excursion Melody"</p>
<p>Weak willows gently sprout tender yellow. Peach blossoms contain buds competing for new makeup. Spring scenery is vexing, preventing sleep. A branch of red apricot extends beyond the east wall. Embellishing the spring scenery in warm harmony. Red fat and green thin compete for strange fragrance. Each leaf and flower is like a painting. Orioles sing, swallows laugh, butterflies and bees run rampant. Even more delightful is that grass and trees meet spring and are all healthy. Continuous days of wind wake the yellow beams. Looking out on the good scenery of the plains. Good flower branches often accompany Lagerstroemia indica in brightness. Friends make appointments to go on spring excursions. Approaching small grass brushes across the horizontal pond. Even more delighted that willows want to sprout branches and peaches want to bloom. There is a deep affection that is worth considering. You should know that the best scenery is originally in spring. Natural paintings are in the river and countryside. When the March spring scenery is deep. Thousands of reds and purples are even more fragrant. It's just that there are several ways to look at the same youth. I will distinguish the details. There are the young women who think about spring and their hearts are restless. The sleepy weather is even more boundless. Occasionally seeing green willows in the fields. They say that their husbands were granted nobility and their wishes have not yet been fulfilled. There are the young ladies and famous women who are in their boudoirs. Deep boudoirs are lonely for mandarin ducks. Suddenly feeling the vexing spring scenery arrive. Their hands are tired and they put down their books for a long afternoon nap. There are the loving couples who are deeply affectionate. Leaning on the railing, they appreciate the good scenery. They make appointments to go on spring excursions outside the city. Rich affection and secrets are spoken harmoniously. There are the men of letters and poets who accompany each other. They fly cups together in Apricot Blossom Village. There are the wives who think about their husbands and their feelings are grievous. They lazily look at the spring scenery and lie on the ivory bed. Although it is a kind of melancholy that cannot be forgotten. How can they face the nine twists and turns that disturb their spring dreams? Therefore, the spring scenery originally has no difference between them. Some people laugh and some are sad. Speaking and talking is not a problem.</p>

<p>Huamei (1060) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening Chapter "Thinking of Spring"</p>
<p>Willows by the fields suddenly turn green. Leaning alone on the railing, I am darkly saddened. My brows are locked in sorrow, and my heart wants to be drunk. I regret teaching my husband to engage in long campaigns. I only see that the clear garden has red and purple flowers like brocade. Butterflies complain and bees run rampant, celebrating the good days. Touching my eyes, the fragrance is full of resentment. I entrust my feelings to playing the Yaoqin. I only see that after burning incense, I press the ice strings. After playing a song, I am touched in my heart. My heart is eagerly expectant. The meaning is deep. Counting the days until his return, I am looking forward to the people. At dusk I divine with the lamp flower, and in the morning I predict with the magpies. My sorrowful intestines turn nine times, and I am again alarmed. I don't know if he has tender feelings for his homeland in another place. Not caring about the hardship, he marries another. If he is fascinated by the flowers and leaves, he is indifferent and unfaithful. Needlessly abandoning the old and pitying the new. I want to ask him how he will comfort my charming anger when he returns. I am recently neglecting my needlework. I am tired of leaning on the silver bed and getting sick. I only hate that I cannot throw away ten thousand kinds of longing. I only resent that my dreams are upside down and even more hurt. Fortunately, my sisters-in-law come to advise me. Let's put on our embroidered shoes and go to enjoy the spring. Remember that the flower morning is tomorrow. Good flower branches are tied with golden bells. The singing birds on the branches are making good sounds again.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter (Wine, Sex, Wealth, and Temper)</p>
<p>Wine can dispel emotions and relieve worries. Dukang's family lives in Jiangzhou. Li Bai writes a hundred poems after drinking a bucket of wine. Dongbin is thrice drunk at Yueyang Tower. Golden sable is removed. Jade pendant is discarded. It was originally a tradition passed down by the immortals. I advise you to always drink wine. A drunkard can dispel ten thousand loads of sorrow. Thousands of kinds of sorrows are instantly discarded. Sex is like a spiritual pill, a wonderful medicine. Zhang Sheng supports his illness and returns to the pink wall. Shi Long makes an appointment with Miss Ruilan. Pan Bizheng steals poetry from Chen Miaochang. Cherry mouth. Orchid musk fragrance. Yang Guifei accompanies Emperor Tang in the palace. I advise you to be happy when you have fun. How long can youth last? Don't miss the good times. Wealth can embolden and display power. Wu Zixu competes for treasures in Lintong. Everyone says that Wanshan is rich. Deng Tong, who is famous throughout the world. Pearl shirt. Brocade screen. Shi Chong in the Golden Valley Garden. I advise you to value money. Money can make ghosts and gods do things. Rich and noble deep mountains are very different. Qi is like a rainbow, ten thousand feet high. Han Xin ascended to the altar to protect the Han Dynasty. Su Qin did not pass the exam and returned home. Ma Chao ordered his troops to chase Cao. The imposing manner is awe-inspiring. Courage is bold. In the end, it is the high aspiration of a man. I advise you to strive for the parents' spirit. We must learn from Master Guan Gong's single-handed approach. The name will be remembered for thousands of years. Discussing four things about wine, sex, wealth, and temper. Since ancient times, the emperor has valued heroes.</p>

<p>Little child star Jin Huisu, who is known as Shirley Temple's rival, has seen her salary increase several times after starring in "Mischievous Miss" and "(blank) Yan啼痕." She recently starred in "Ten Thousand Mile Search for Husband" (Paddy O'Day) for 20th Century Fox. In it, she plays an Irish orphan wandering in New York City, earning tears and laughter, with unexpected magic. Her every song and dance moves the soul and is endearing. The film is now showing at the Great Light Cinema.</p>

<p>— Songzi</p>
<p>Incarnation Girl</p>
<p>"Incarnation Girl" is the first work by the famous set designer Fang Peilin. It is a good work of interesting ethical stories. This is about an overseas Chinese rich businessman who, in order to comfort his father's desire for a grandson, falsely claims that his daughter is a boy. After eighteen years of concealment, although it is finally discovered to be a daughter, the old father has spent eighteen happy days. From this plot, we can know that this is a movie full of extremely strong emotions.</p>
<p>In addition to this touching story, a very humorous romance is interspersed in the middle, which not only makes the development of the plot more powerful, but also maximizes the true meaning of love. The allocation of actors is especially the best point of this work. Yuan Meiyun is successful in playing the granddaughter here. Especially after she is disguised, no one will believe that she is Yuan Meiyun because of her handsome and unrestrained attitude. Wang Guilin plays the grandfather, expressing the love of flesh and blood to the bone, so touching. Other actors such as Wang Yin, Zhou Xuan, Xu Manli, Jiang Xiu, etc., all have excellent results.</p>
<p>Father and Son Heroes</p>
<p>"Father and Son Heroes" is Wang Cilong's first directorial work after entering Yihua, a very tense detective film. The main purpose is to dissect the dark secrets and sins of the city, depicting the unscrupulous cunning of a part of the so-called gentlemen and celebrities. At the same time, it warns young people not to indulge in alcohol and lust, and not to be controlled by a bad environment, thus ruining their great careers in one fell swoop. Wang Cilong has long had a long reputation in the film industry. This film uses his table special technique to handle it, and it is guaranteed that it will give us full satisfaction when it is released in the future.</p>

<p>Li Pingqian's "Peach and Plum Competing for Beauty" has completed seven or eight tenths. By the end of the month, the "Peach and Plum Competing for Beauty" issue will be resolved satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Cheng Bugao's "New and Old Shanghai" started filming the other day. The protagonists have been decided as Wang Xianzai and Shu (blank) Wen, who are the best at acting. Another noteworthy point is that the entire play has no supporting roles, and every actor has an important role to play.</p>
<p>The protagonist of Xu Xinfu's new work "Diamond" will be played by Xu Lai.</p>
<p>Zhang Shichuan's new work after "Peach Blossoms After Robbery" is "Love's Escape," which is still based on Hong Shen's work.</p>
<p>The new photography studio of the Fenglin Bridge General Factory held a (blank) ceremony last week.</p>
<p>The "Spring Flower" song in "Spring Flower" has recently become popular in various departments of the stars, and I am afraid that in the near future, it will become popular in the streets and alleys.</p>

<p>Warner Bros.' long-rumored $2 million blockbuster "Iron-Blooded General" (Captain Blood) is said to have a definite release date (I heard that the Great Light has scheduled it for the 28th of this month). The film took a year to produce, from the script being written to the actors auditioning, which took several weeks. There are still the background and prop planning, which took the set department several months to work on. There are seven large sailing ships from the 17th century, which were all built in the film studio. When Mi (blank) Corz directed this film, he was unwilling to compromise, no matter how difficult it was. At that time, the company divided the film into three parts, and the naval battle work of the film was put in the first part, because the battle scenes here are too great and intense. The two male and female protagonists in the film are (blank) Rolle Felling and Oly (blank) Teharv (blank). There are at least 5,000 actors playing (blank).</p>
