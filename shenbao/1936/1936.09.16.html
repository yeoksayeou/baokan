<p>時評</p>
<h3>中日外交談判開始</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>滯留滬瀆之日大使川越茂氏。始於前日欵段入都。昨與張外長作正式之會晤。開始進行樽俎間之折衝。同時日武官喜多佐籐等。亦複追踪到京。提供意見。協議對策。一時外交官廨中。頓戚空氣之緊張。久苦窒悶之中日局面。經此重要談判以後。或能有豁然開朗之一日。中日人士。在此轉捩時期。無不傾心歛神。翹首企踵。以注視前途之推展。吾輩從事新聞業者。職司民間之喉舌。關懷旣切。不能無辭。敢就管見所及。略貢一得之愚。</p>
<p>第一。吾人以為此次中日談判。應由雙方披瀝誠意。屛除意氣。以共謀整個問題之解决。對於巳往造成之過　。容有隔閡誤會之處。不妨就其癥結所在。分別予以疏解或調整。而於未來提携之蹊徑。則在互說精神之下。設法奠定其基礎。此在世界危機日迫之今日。東亞兩大國為應付環境而打算。原亦有融通之必要。惟是誠意之界說。要以平等互惠為原則。而調整之解釋。允以放棄侵略為前提。若一方　忿泯嫌重修舊好一方得寸進尺。漫　新獲。或則為有意之督過。責人以無誠意。或則用挾迫之手段。美其名曰調整。皆非吾人所樂聞。而深願此决會議中。不至有如斯過慮之事實出現也。</p>
<p>第二。川越大使之所謂國交調整。固為其本來之使命。而最近發生之成都北海兩事。自亦為其談判之核心。關於此點。吾人極願川越大使能以睿智之頭腦。本諒解之精神。顧及我方當局所感事實上之困難。而勿為已甚之疵求。譬如北海今為翁照垣部所駐防。當局正在勸其撤退之中。翁照垣部以扞衛邦土為言。急切猶未用命。當局自亦未便換之以驟。幾經斡旋之桂局。豈容以此重啟嫌隙。日方深明此理。應勿予人難堪。且以此為披瀝誠意之見端。自必更得我方多數之同情。由是而進行調整國交。其於交涉之程序上。必能增加若干順利之成分。可斷言也。</p>
<p>尙有一節。吾人亦須附帶聲言者。日方動曰華人排日。其實曠觀國內現狀。已無所謂排日思想。上有忍辱負重之政府。下有積困思蘇之人民。窮途憔悴。亦云甚矣。卽在熱血靑年。滿貯愛國思想。亦僅於愛國而止。絕無排外之志。人之欲善。誰不如我。以日本國民愛國思想之濃厚。寗能禁人之不愛其國乎。至川粵事件之造成。則　為暴客之行逕。要亦由於刺激太甚。遂令維民而走險。倒果求因。責有攸歸。今後日方果能一改前轍。確　提携。則此項反常之情緒。必可使之消弭於無形。不然。雖藉政府之力量。亦難統制人民內心之蘊結。日方能知以事實為依歸。勿强詞以奪理。則交涉前途。庶其有豸。</p>

<h3>吳報錦　赴日研究返國</h3>
<p>談在日所得印象</p>
<p>前本市保安處秘書吳報錦去歲派赴日德兩國考察、曾先東渡、並考入東京帝國大學大學院研究、業於日昨乘麥堅利總統號（President　of　Mekinley）蒞滬、下榻於新亞旅館、記者特趨車往、訪承發表談話如左、</p>
<p>日本之有今日、其原因甚多、摘其要者言之、莫如幅員不廣、易於開闢與統治、且其地為海洋所環繞、交通旣屬便利又易接觸他邦文物、故能吸收西歐之長而揚棄該國之糟澤、兼以明治維新之後、各地藩閥將政權交還天皇、因此統一事業、名實雙方得以完成、社會秩序得以安謐、且又得助於警政制度之確立及人民勤樸模仿之美風與夫婦女分工之處匪淺、舉國上下、幾莫不直接間接參加於公私之生產、旣少奢侈浪費之惡習又鮮有不良之嗜好、故社會之病態同題較稀於他邦、其國內近年來對外貿易、月有出超、際此整個不景氣瀰漫於全世界、而其商品尙能馳騁於各市塲、當不愧其價廉物美及經營方式之有獨到之勝、再者、一方面對人民允其對知識份子日謀改善其待遇而使之獲得職業上之機會均等、旣可平均施展其才能、又可削减失業羣之數量、因此一般生計—所謂水準下之生活、較為安定、</p>
<p>其國內一般低級職業部鬥及輕工事業、大都為婦女所占有、此不但養成婦女為國服務與分勞之心而獲經濟上之獨立、並使一般男子不能不從事於重工業及立志奮發而企圖偉大事業之開拓也、</p>
<p>彼邦之文化水準、因實施强制義務教育六年制度（最近文部省又倡導延長二年之擬議）以來、全國文盲幾乎絕跡、且各處補習·技能·職業教育等之林立、以及書報雜誌之氾濫、對於他邦新興知識之介紹與夫傳播之迅速、堪稱集各國翻譯之大成、</p>
<p>日俄兩國堪稱遠東之梟雄、自日俄戰爭後、日本一躍而誇立於列强之林、兼以地居海岸且國內原料缺乏、致未遭先進國之垂涎、因此為求其國家之生存與防禦、却反獲得陸海空三種軍備充實飛躍及對外市塲擴張之機、大有亞洲惟我獨尊之概、契機於東省事變後因地形上之毘連故於經濟政治軍事諸方面與蘇俄時起利害之抵觸、而竟有作有意或義氣之步　衝突、國內輿論因以沸騰、然而不過為筆戰上虛張聲勢而已、察其實際、雙方之具體行動决非當前也、</p>
<p>在另一方面言之、因其地勢上得先天之優越與夫國人之勤樸剛毅之努力、故能擠入於近代新興國家之列中、但終因國力自給生產之不足大都仰仗外力作其本位上之奠基、故不無中乾與本來顚倒之憾、且連年預算之澎漲、而人民痛感課稅及公債之負累、此點實不得不為彼邦憂之、至於其社會之裏外、當亦不能逾越現制度鐵則之範疇、惟一般考察者易流於皮相僅觀察其片面之優點、而忘較深之觀察、然較深之認識又非較長時期深入社會之裏層而作多方之體味不為功回顧我國之悠久歷史與夫獨特之文物、且據各國學者之研究所得、中國人頭腦之優秀、懷抱之寬大、思想之敏銳、識見之高遠、俱臻上乘、故有所期望如左、</p>
<p>選拔全國優秀壯年作有組織之軍事精神、職業技能及國際知識之實際訓練、備作復興國家强有力之新細胞、以期他日充常各生產部門之幹員及國防之支柱、</p>
<p>蓋中國目前之所應開拓之事、實較任何國家為多、故人才之需要與培養、亦較其他各國為迫切、大可趁此外轢頻仍及國際間利害關係之微妙之際、正為國運甦生之機、舉國上下作人材之統計、俾得分工各務、務使學以致用而增各項事業之效率、在不違背法律與治安影響之下、務使其獲得思想之自由、俾各國精神有所伸張並廣博各方獨特之見解與客觀之評論而實獻於國家、與其認為社會之阻力、不如總而匯之使化為大衆之向心力、</p>
<p>對於澄消史治、嚴為甄別錄用後、似宜以終身制、恩給制、縮小行政區域、裁撇駢枝機關、彰明當罰釐淸良莠、掃蕩官塲陋習、廓淸宦海人員、提高中下級職員之待遇並鞏固其職守、則治法治人雙方兼備、對於國家之前途或亦不無裨益也、</p>
<p>各國之情形不同、故需要各異、似不宜一味採取或描模他邦、而摸殺一國之特殊性與創造性、</p>
<p>旅外僑胞、對祖國頻年之淬勵精進及施政舉措、深表感謝、蓋由痛感外壓之激刺而屬望於祖國之振作、深願國人勿事負其熱望也、此次行旅忽忽、茲僅發表見聞之一端、他日有機、當以專文論及之、</p>

<h3>證券　多方出籠債市不支</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、市況稍見活動、但亦未有若何變動、惟昨帶疲軟之象、蓋以多方擯持不支、稍有出籠、及空方稍有動賣、如十三號之多頭出籠、六號及四十七號之賣出、十號及五十四號等亦隨之出售、但市價並不因此起鉅大渡瀾、僅稍形活躍、市價所小有限、昨日經過、開盤初堅後疲、乃為六及四十七號售出而趨疲、故有前列好五分一角、後列小五分一角之畸形狀況、次盤遠期甲種小二角、餘仍參差互見五分一角、午後開盤、六號及四十七號、以及二十號等均有賣、則市上稍有謠傳、市價一致趨疲、小五分一角至三角、當為多日來最活躍之一盤、收盤復又高低不一、五十三號買進、散戶亦頗有吸收、甲乙兩種略好一角左右、餘則續小一角左右、市價結果、計略小五分一角至三角半不等、成交總數、共計五百六十五萬五千元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>

<h3>紗花　紗市壓力仍重</h3>
<p>紗市晨跌午回、氣勢又入於盤旋狀態、但一般投機家暨大戶傾向拋賣、壓迫頗重、惟現紗客方需求暢健、故售價堅挺、且倉庫中籌碼日見減縮矣、</p>
<p>本月獨跌一元三</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因海外紗花市況不佳、各月呈一致下降之勢、塲中交易鬆濫無勁、多數人心望跌、各月跌六、七、角、二盤參差不一、上下二、三角、三盤浮戶抵補、忽跌七、八、角、迨至收盤、空方仍來壓迫、市態急變、近跌七角至一元二角、遠跌七、八角、查賡豐、潤康、福康購買甚湧、然仍難遏止虛風、裕大、泰昌、恒昌、空方則加碼殊夥、標紗結果各月比上日收盤價跌六、七、八、九角至一元四角、午後開盤市況略昂、因大戶拖進、籌碼較枯市盤步步上升、但本月某君仍大量壓迫而益弱、遠月較堅、結果各月比上午收盤價漲、一、二、四、五、六、角、查賣出大孚二千一百包、裕大一千〇五十包、華懋六百五十包、慎記一千二百五十包、泰昌二千二百包、益昶六百五十包、協成一千四百五十包、恒昌一千一百五十包、澄記一千一百包、買進錦昌一千〇五十包、聚興一千一百五十包、賡豐二千六百包、森康八百包、潤康二千包、信誠七百包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<h3>現需活躍　標花跌而復回</h3>
<p>棉市晨初下跌、因美棉回挫、印棉亦弱、浮空拋賣甚湧而跌、繼以長和潤康空頭抵補、多頭加　、雙方並　　　、　面　　、兼之現棉情形俏利、午後市　復　矣、</p>
<p>棉花　　無上落</p>
<p>棉花前市開　、因　棉疲軟跌八至十四磅音、印棉跌一、二、羅比、大阪三品花跌三、四角、市塲人心不振、賣氣尤强、各月均跌一角半至二角、二盤因　豐、長和、潤康、瑞大等努力拖進、多空並起、回上五分至一角半、迨至三收盤聞紗市乏力、散戶及大戶在十月期頻施壓迫、市盤乃復回挫、大孚、澄記、裕大、仁豐、望泰興、泰昌、長豐、生源、永大賣出甚旺、標花結果各月比上日收盤價跌二角至三角半、午後開盤、上午空額、大批買進、加之現棉幫需活潑、人心轉挺、跳起二、三角、收盤稍回、結果各月比上午收盤價回漲二角半至四角、查賣出恒益二千擔、大孚一千九百擔、澄記二千七百擔、裕大四千四百擔、仁豐二千三百擔、望泰興三千一百擔、泰昌三千一百擔、益昶三千九百擔、長豐七千五百擔、生源三千三百擔、永大三千二百担、瑞大四千五百担、潤康一萬零一百担、大昶四千九百担、源興昌四千六百担、長和七千五百担、通記一千九百担、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<h3>國外花紗俱見下跌</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市況不定、各月由跌三磅音至漲二磅音、晨初南方及本地幫售出、旋以同業及利物浦買進十月、華爾街買進十二月、市價回上、後因南方賣出、收數激增、市價大跌、有若干人注意十月期、亦有作近遠套頭者、因謠傳存底有增加之可能故也、收盤平疲、計現貨跌十磅音、期貨跌六至十四磅音、英棉現貨跌一點、現貨跌五六點、印棉初因投機家及操業者買進而漲、後因歐洲出口商賣及多頭了結而疲、計平果爾跌二、五羅比、奧姆辣及白羅溪跌一、五羅比、原電錄左、（十四日電）</p>

<h3>疋票　秋銷特　棉布現貨供不敷求</h3>
<p>昨棉布市面、因各路賣銷　　開展、雖東疋白貨受紗花下挫影響、每疋跌落二分半、獨青島貨十四磅雙龍珠細布、因來滬稀少、市盤最堅、目下各廠因趕織坯布、致出品大乏、如上海大康同與等廠細布、細斜、均須整空棧單一二星期之久、方能車得現貨、本廠白貨供給仍大形缺乏、申新廠原來出品最多、而目下亦僅一二成、新裕廠地球細布　漲每疋一角、十八磅賽馬粗布、因漢口到貨缺乏、價升五分、各廠粗布細斜均殊挺秀、中外花色布疋尤甚堅俏、廠商有無貨應市之慨、良以本年各地豐稔、棉布需要大旺、故此後卽使花價　廉、布市形勢、或仍能繼續保持也、</p>
<h3>糧食　現貨難小　標麥無大鬆之望</h3>
<p>昨又回起五六分</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份大致平定、本月份初開不動、遠期亦平、旋以買氣稍暢、價遂略好、迨至下午開盤、因天時又忽轉變、業外人心、突見好良、買戶一活、各月份遂帶好三五分、業中人意思、以為現麥一時難落、標準市面、當無大鬆之望、現麥市面、高貨仍懋、開山東穎州麥五元零五分、次為三分、洋河瑤灣麥五元次四元九角八分、期光麥五元零五分、五河麥五元零三分、東台麥四元八角四分、台州麥四元七角九分、大橋麥四元八角、淮安麥四元六角、漢口麥四元六角、次五角七分、又次四角半、又車麥四元八角半、次七角、由福新去七千包、阜豐去三千包云、</p>

<h3>麵粉交易平淡　市價出入甚微</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初平繼定之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥互有一角上落、坎拿大漲三四角、當開價時、以現粉去化、仍少起色、故本月份開價、曾低至三元一角一分、較前日小二分、十月份以下、用洋麥回升、人心尙穩、較前日無甚上落、迨至下午開盤、本月份因浮空略補、市氣轉穩、較上午開盤、回起二分、遠期開出入兩寂、仍然平靜、本月份交易所定二十五日為最終之日、故在此數日內、如實銷平寂、過振常亦不可能云、</p>

<h3>新羊尖小去一二角</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各幫來源仍祗到十餘號、貨共二千石左右、厚早粳本銷奇滯、致價又小幾分、惟薄稻因賴包胃青島烟臺及南洋幫辦六七百包、是以市成暗緊之勢、東新粳到銷相仿、仍守原盤、而各色新尖市況殊疲、新羊尖到貨旣夥、而銷化不良、致價竟跌一二角、蘆尖等亦小幾分、陰變元平庸、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源約二十號、市上各貨去胃白破粳續化、價形平定、百元平疲、新陳羊尖到貨不旺、零化稍動、市價定勢、埠客尖零銷轉動、價形埠尖轉昂、客尖定立、西新粳乏貨、東新粳及其餘各貨定局之格、</p>
<h3>客秈湧到銷路反呆</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市況、本客去化難旺、然以到多消少、行情續見回下、前昨兩天中新到又有三四萬包、昨日客化則祗八千許、故市面已經趨落、目粵幫又呆、昨日祗成交漢京糙米二千包、因此高次各檔一律續小四五分至角許不等、惟汕頭幫昨日辦胃較活、價低後進胃尤　、全市成交五千多包、本街胃口較淡、祗去一千七百五十包、前日開出贛米一千　百五十包、湘米一千七百五十包、漢糙米　千包、京秈八百八十三包、台秈五十五包、粵秈五百包、</p>
<h3>新芝麻市氣平穩</h3>
<p>新芝麻近來陸續有千餘包抵滬、但大平均為貨戶做解洋莊凈貨之用、市塲上流通交易、祗以零星小數、故在銷塲平滯之下、此市　得以平穩、行情雖見參差、然新貨上場之候、有身份關係、可不作漲跌論、雖洋莊貨乃標準化、　新聞之價、則有升降、昨由達孚洋行訂進指定　月十日前交貨、　百噸、價開十二元二角二分半、及十二元二角半、茲照大局　之、亦無甚榮辱、昨現貨由汕頭福州本街等辦去沙市麻八百餘包、漢口蔴六十包、浦鎮蔴十四包、崇明蔴四包云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新紅黑棗俱已上市　新核桃須虧本……黑瓜子聞出千數百包</h3>
<p>紅棗　天津新棉紅棗首批到十數件、昨已見樣、因貨身潮軟、開五元二角、次貨略減、照成本還須耗虧、</p>
<p>黑棗　濟南新黑棗、首批亦有少數運到、貨品較邇而潮、當卽開出、價為十二元、（棗規）</p>
<p>核桃　天津新核桃、昨到一批、當卽開出、貨品尙佳、聞　申成本須二十六元、但僅開二十四元、須耗二元之譜、</p>

<h3>糖市　海南赤回升二角</h3>
<p>昨糖市穩定、公會劃盤、二四粗砂白現貨二十一元五角半、轉口貨六元五角七分半、均有成交、東白四號現貨二十一元二角半、轉口YP嘜六元二角半、八號現貨二十一元一角半、轉口六元一角半、九號YRO嘜二十元九角、轉口TM嘜六元、比前路緊、本廠綿白振記一號二十元四角、金心大華一號均二十元半、號貨有潮帶開出正發赤五十一包、十五元一角半、又大興號開出海南赤一百五十包、十三元八角、比前回升二角、潮青呌價均緊、未有成交</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲經交易頗為零落</h3>
<p>昨日國外絲市頗見恍惚、紐約橫濱更漲跌互歧、計紐約近期漲半分、期貨漲一分、里昂日絲跌〇、五〇法郎、廣東絲漲〇、七五法郎、上海絲則仍持原價、橫濱絲市、晨開現貨跌五元、期貨跌六元、至下午則又見下跌、申埠絲市清堅、白廠經B字二〇、二二條分、洋莊開價為六〇〇元、但廠商持價仍在六三〇元左右、致成交艱難、昨日祗開利信孚等進白廠及雙宮絲九十三包、用戶方面、申埠除美亞廠有零星購進外、其餘亦甚寂寞、昨日杭幫用戶略加吸收、然成交包額不多、全市成交共一百五十三包、</p>
<h3>紅綠茶歐銷甚清</h3>
<p>昨日茶市、依然清淡、祁門紅茶、英商協和怡和等行、均擬大量吸收、而皖贛紅茶總運銷處、亦因亟待結束、協議對策、關於品質之評判、市價之高下、現時正在進行中、至綠茶方面、亦因高莊存底缺乏、無多交易、普通珍眉、額數雖有萬餘箱、然因國外來價緊縮、華茶商不願過分遷就、市情無從進展、惟針眉珠茶等項、略有零星銷售云、</p>
<h3>華茶在紐絲綸自由發賣　茶葉檢騐發生效果</h3>
<p>實業部上海商品檢騐局對於出口商品之檢騐、素極嚴肅、以冀出口商品日趨精良、國外市塲逐漸開拓、而對出口茶葉之檢騐、更為重視、凡經檢騐合格者給予合格證書、方准出口、故華茶之品質蒸蒸日上、茲據惠　頓領事館報告、輸往紐絲綸茶葉、素經該地衛生局檢騐、認為合格者、始准出賣、不合格者不准出售、並須罰欵繳檢費一鎊一先令、我國從前輸紐茶類、雖多准發賣、但限定售於華人飲用、我僑商因茶葉　交檢騐、旣耗時間、又　被認為不合格、發繳檢查費、故多直認茶質為不合格、專賣於華人、此種辦法、至今替沿已久、對於我國茶葉對外貿易遭　受大損失、且令華茶聲譽含垢蒙羞、際此我國推廣國際貿易時期、極難容該例繼續存在、我國駐惠震頓領事館以我國茶葉旣經政府設局檢騐合格後、始准出口、故來紐之茶、實無再行檢騐之必要、經與紐政府交涉、請將入口華茶、免予檢騐、並准予自由發賣、不受特別限制、已經紐絲綸政府函復、嗣後入口之華茶、凡經我政府建騐合格持有證書可憑者、免予檢騐、並不再限售於華人云云、</p>

<h3>國貨女訪問員</h3>
<p>— 呆</p>
<p>這一次本市國貨運動聯合會，為喚醒一班麻木不仁而醉心愛購洋貨的婦女界起見，特地招考女訪問員，巳在正式訓練，不久將要開始工作了。雖然祇有三個，但筆者對於她們却希望其能夠完成所負莫大的使命呢！</p>
<p>的確，就上海一埠說來，洋貨的輸入，除了機器以外，衣食和化裝品，佔居多數，就魚翅和脂粉，近年來進口數字的驚人，便可得到相當的明證了。然而這些東西，不是都要經過主婦的手的嗎？倘然做主婦的決心不服用洋貨，那麽魚翅脂粉等等，那得會侵入家庭之中呢？</p>
<p>可知由女訪問員到每一個調遣的家庭去訪問主婦，闡述愛用洋貨的危險，可促使中國的滅亡，從事回過頭來，服用國貨，那當然是一件重要的工作，直接可以倡導國貨，間接可以救國。提倡國貨的方法，不止一種，女訪問員不過就近從事國貨運動的人所想到的一種而巳，過往凡是參加國貨運動的同志們，口頭的演講，筆下的著述，以及籌辦國貨展覽會等等，不是也都是重要工作嗎？</p>
<p>可是不幸得很，那些高貴的婦女，摩登的小姐，有人演講國貨問題，不去聽講，報章雜誌，每年難得看一二次，至於國貨展覽會，國貨商塲，國貨運動會等等，那麽她們早就抱定宗旨，不去買一些東西。因此，你儘管想盡了種種方法，宣傳國貨運動，她們還是儘量的購用洋貨，什麽都不相干的。</p>
<p>好吧，現在由女訪問員到每一個家庭裏面，或是婦女集團之中去訪問，那麽祇要接見，那些高貴的主婦，摩登的小姐，女訪問員的勸導和中選，無論如何，該是可以入耳了，比較國貨展覽，國貨運動會的與她們，自然可密切而有效一些。</p>
<p>不過女訪問員到每一個家庭之中去訪問，主婦是否招待，招待之後，是否接受勸告？問題還多，個中當然還有不少困難。就上海的情形說來，如果說不出重要的事件要和主人見面，立刻被僕役或司關拒絕，也是常有的事。就是開你進去了，見了主婦，為了你是不相干的人，當你一個不速之客，看她的白眼，受她的冷待，更是不希罕的事。因此，一個女訪問員進行訪問工作的時候，至少要具有百折不撓的精神，和充分的忍耐力，不畏難，不怕苦，耐人嘰嘲，看人冷面，才能用了種種方法，勸告主婦們回過頭來，勿用洋貨。</p>
<p>另一方面，我們深得上海的地方很廣，單是三個女訪問員，在短時間內，那裏可走遍所有的家庭？所以女訪問開始工作而後，如果有效的話，我們深望國貨運動聯合會能夠再添用幾個；同時，外埠各大城市之中，也應由提倡國貨運動的團體依法僱用女訪問員。</p>
<h3>國貨女訪問員的借鏡</h3>
<p>— 孟昭</p>
<p>好消息傳來，國貨女訪問員，將開始實行訪問工作了！這是市民國貨年裏的新紀錄！可是國貨女訪問員，身負提倡國貨與推銷國貨的重大使命！應如何伶俐其口齒，熟練其技巧！達到家庭主婦們，愛用國貨的目的，這是值得觀摩的。</p>
<p>本報星期增刑，莊雪茵女士談的「職業婦女的自白」文裏，她任女跑街的訪問經驗話是：「先生須知我們此來並非為我們要向你推銷貨物，我是來幫助解決家庭的重要問題的，也可以說是替你經濟上作一種打算，必定使你得到完美幸福的……」又說：「……訪問家庭的主婦，基於「母愛」和易於打動她的希冀心這一點上，成績倒非常可觀！……平時無意中的交際，我們是要處處給人家些良好的印象！並不在乎你如何會裝飾？如何會辦論？而在你沉着懇摯，感動了和你來往的人，自然，各地的方言！至少要能說國語，英語，本地話，也是在交際會談中一件重要的工具……」莊女士從經驗之中得來的金玉之言，的確值得國貨女訪問員借鏡的，筆者特地提出來，寫了斯文。</p>
<h3>以身作則的勸導</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>在報紙和雜誌上，曾讀到許多篇「學生應當利用暑期，勸導民衆國貨」。驟讀之下，以為這是一個很好的辦法。因為學生是智識份子，人們對之有相當的敬仰；而且他們有靈敏的頭腦，勸聽的口才，宣傳起來，一定收事半功之效。可是仔細地一研究，也是紙上，絕對不可能之事。這理由是很簡單，因為現今大多數的學生，倒是洋貨的推銷家，衣是洋裝，用是洋貨，呌他們去宣傳服用國貨，豈非滑天下之大稽嗎？這一段話也許學子們看了動氣，不過這是事實，絲毫沒有誣衊，所以我說呌學生們在暑期內勸導別人，還是自己下一決心，先服用國貨，倒是是一個切實的辦法。</p>
<p>學生們有了一枝犀利的筆頭，做幾篇服用國貨的文章；有了三寸不爛之舌，講一番救國的大道理，而事實恰恰相反，這我却認為是一件恥辱的事情。前幾年我跟了一隊國貨宣傳隊到鄉間工作，在茶肆裏碰着一位頭腦冬烘的老先生，他聽了幾位隊員的演講，起先倒也點頭拍掌，表示讚許。後來這位老先生忽然發見隊員中有一位外罩長袍內穿西裝褲的人，他陡的拍案大罵起來，說甚麽「衣冠禽獸」咧！「外面仁義道德，內裏男盜婦娼」咧！他像發神經病一般的咆哮，雖經人解說再三，可是他絕不罷休；一般好事的人，也齊聲附和起來，結果是非但宣傳不成，衹好掩旗息鼓而歸。從這件事上得來的教訓要勸導別人，先要「以身作則」。</p>
<h3>中國華一工業社之保安燈</h3>
<p>近來國人於工業出品新發明甚多，紛向政府請求專利，足見國貨生産之猛進。中有藥水電池保安燈者，為朱鑑麟劉子儀二君所發明，完全採用國貨製造，係利賴化學作用，發生電力，其光綫與普通電燈無異，其經濟較煤油省費一半，而且使用便利，毫無危險，業經實業部准予專利，製造廠設上海東京路九六三號，規模宏大，設備精密，完全用科學方法管理，內分機械，製造、配藥，材料，電氣等五組刻正積極工作，逆料此燈發售，定受社會歡迎，從此光明遠播，，雖偏省僻地，無電燈設備之區，亦可享受電燈之利，誠國貨界之好現象也。</p>
<h3>《作者鄭重更正》</h3>
<p>本刑上期所投拙作：「國貨藥水電精燈之新活躍」，內述及華一工業社，暫行停頓等情，茲經查明，絕對與事實不符，按華一工業社之實部專利澄清，既早領到，而營業範圍尤遠及各地，信譽卓著，誠恐外界以訛傳誤，用特鄭重更正，以昭翔實，並致歉忱！　秋郎謹啟</p>

<p>貢獻話</p>
<h3>工廠訪問與家庭訪問</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>担任家庭訪問之女士五人，負極大之使命，不日出發滬西一帶，實行家庭訪問，於出發之前，先作工廠訪問，其意義極重大，其步驟極正當，不可不一睮及之：</p>
<p>訪問家庭主婦，目的在說明提倡國貨之重要。顧提倡國貨，非可以空言告人，必有真知灼見，以實况與實物告人。凡原料之採集，製造之手續，工作之新狀况，與其效用何若，優點何在，均應一一說明，瞭如指掌，而後可以取得主婦之信心，引起主婦服用之熱忱。尤在某品如何使用，如何保藏，如何經久，如何經濟，均應出以指導之方式，不厭不倦，為各家家庭踏實服務。即就五洲，中法，新亞等藥廠而言，則應定一家庭必備藥品之小冊，為主婦作顧問，又就三友鴻新等布廠而言，則小孩服裝，如何剪裁，送人衣服，限定價格，如何支配，訪問員應為主婦從長設計。此外日用品物，以最經濟最有效的小家庭計算，應備多少種品物，亦可斟酌一單，供主婦之參考。凡此種種，非先實地赴工廠詳細參觀不可。胡西圖許曉初項繩武盧志學諸君對於此事，均有豐富之經驗，認為訪問員出發之前，應先聽取國貨界領袖之談話，與親見各工廠之狀况，而後成竹在胸，應付便利，此真閱曆有得之言。深願各訪問員身體力行，切實做去，更願家庭主婦，遇事諮詢，隨時商權，苟有不滿意之點，直言以告，以促工業界之改進。敬貢從言，以為家庭訪問事業開始之一助。</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （醉樵）</p>
<p>肢體上殘缺的人，他是世上最痛苦而最可憐的人！我們假使是健全的話，對他們應有同情心；遇到必要時，還應當盡力去幫助他們，使他們痛苦的內心，得到深切的安慰；可是事實上並不盡然。</p>
<p>我們看到戲劇上的假扮駝背，跛足，瞎子等等，故意做來維妙維肖，博得台下觀衆的歡笑，我覺到社會總是畸形的！還有一般人，見到少隻手或缺隻腳的乞丐，向他乞憐時，他急急避開，不要把這可憎的形態，送到眼簾裏來，留下一個不快的印象，這種人他決不會知道殘廢人是如何的不幸，同時他們更不明瞭人類是應有互助的責任的！</p>
<p>「一盤散沙」！這恥辱的帽兒，終於中在我們中國人的頭上了，我們是不是扔要去這頂帽兒呢？又何况在現在肢體殘缺的中國，是怎樣的需要我們健全的一羣，來輔助他！使他在風雨飄搖的難關中，安穩渡過；那麽「互助」的偉大成功，在世界上放著光芒奪目的火炬了！</p>
<h3>不祥的「西」字</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>說起這個「西」字來，原沒有多大的意思：若要考出字源，那末：也不過說象形上得到他的用法；因為最先這個字，就有一隻禽鳥，棲在巢上，他的頭還向着西方望著，於是就把他的圖形，結構成了鹵的樣子，後來篆字變作楷書，又成了「西」的式子，原來的初意，呌誰去考據呢？</p>
<p>現在「西」字，我說有些不祥的惡運，臨到他的方向了，你不記得從前共黨鬧亂子的時候，不是在江「西」和山「西」兩個省分，弄得生靈塗炭，也就為有了一個「西」字，遭了兵災，受盡苦楚；這還是不久的既往，想來大家還能記得吧！倘然遠些說：從歷史上去查考，哼！「西」夏，「西」涼，等等，那一處不是要和漢土稱兵侵犯敵對呢！說到外國，去年的阿比「西」尼亞，被強暴的意大利，把他一鼓打盡，就算阿王不甘屈服，抵抗了七個多月，末了，還是只是得別了祖若宗經營締造傳下來之母國，向別國逃去，纔保住生王之頭，不然的話，他嘴上的鬍鬚，難免不做成板刷，要給黑衣宰相的革履刷一下子了。你想！不是也受着這個「西」字的結果啊！</p>
<p>好了，最近稱兵異動，又偏偏出在「西」南方面，其實也止廣「西」一省，現在廣「西」雖巳沒有問題；但是「西」班牙，眼前不是也從「西」屬的摩洛哥抗叛起來麽？這要知道，不是小可的玩意兒，如期是牽了這一要髪，真正全身要動，哪！恐怕一九三六年這一句預言，就竟不幸而中了。什麽緣故呢？因為這一個導火綫，難保不是歐洲第二次大戰的開塲，而且尤其是在歐「西」，將來正要演出一幕血劇咧！不信，請大家瞧着吧！</p>
<h3>圖案</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>人類的目光，自從具備了近代化的欣賞藝術之後，一切即用綫條分別着形態了。綫條，有直綫條，曲綫條，粗綫條，狹綫條之分，於是應運而生了圖案。雖然圖案是用勻整而有粗織的綫條湊成的，實物，總不會甚麽都合於圖案，但是聽明的人，是有本領把實物改造得富有圖案的色彩，或是圖案化的。甚至於人的輪廓，也可改造得具有着圖案意味的綫條。</p>
<p>婦女用的新裝出版物上，登載着的，都是整幅的新裝圖案。雖然有人疑心着，圖案，總不過是圖案而巳，但是聰明的新裝師，却能依着圖案，而裁剪成圖案化的新裝。娘兒們把圖案化的新裝，包裹着非圖案化的肉體，便成了一位圖案化，而且現代化的美女。立體型的肩，流綫型的腰，化癡肥臃腫為苗條化瘦骨嶙峋為豐腴。適當地支配着綫條，便甚麽都不難化醜惡而成圖案美。</p>
<p>新裝師的技能，是那麽的高超，同時，美容師，更能把娘兒們的臉面，改造得合於圖案美。雖然在人臉上，甚麽都是生就着的，但是大小眼兒，可以改造成不大不小，恰到好處，而合於臉型中所應有的綫條約結構。耳，鼻，口，唇的綫條，也可按着美麗的圖案而改造。在圖案中，有時是在簡單的綫條之外，為了重力的平衡起見，需要幾個點兒作點綴，於是不得不應用人造痣，或人造雀斑。而一般娘兒們，所認為最難解決的眉兒，現在也巳有人發明着膠背的人造眉了。睫毛的黏併，也有着睫膠了。把三四根睫毛，膠結成一根，絕對不是一件困難之事。所以在古代，是只有傳真的美女畫，這年頭兒，巳是進步到改造成圖案型的美女了。這便是所謂不為時代所支配，而人類支配着朝代。</p>
<p>古代，是人類為時代所支配的，所以甚麽都任令着自然的進展。三百年，四百年，還是不以跳出一個原始的模型，是挺稀鬆平淡的。這年頭兒，是人類支配着時代的了。即以建築一事而論，一九三四年，一九三五年，各有其自有的圖案，一九三六年，自然又具有着一九三六年的圖案了。所以圖案，雖不過是幾個綫條，所組成的一個簡單的畫面，可是在實際上，圖案這東西，可說是現代文明的原動力之一。</p>
<h3>名伶成見之化除</h3>
<p>— 思素</p>
<p>舞台裏演的是京戲遊藝塲的大京班也是演的京戲；然而看的人却都有個成見，以為雙方所演的戲，不能等量齊觀，遊藝塲裏的京戲，大然比不得舞台裏的京戲。</p>
<p>這種成見本來並不算謬，遊藝塲是白戲雜陳的所在，京戲雖居於主要地位，但終是白戲中之一部，自不能與舞台相提並論。而且有身價的藝員，也大都不肯加入遊藝塲的大京班，怕因此有損身價，寗可以舞台裏備位三四等，不願作遊藝塲大京班的冠軍，這又是藝員本身所抱之不可思議的成見。</p>
<p>然而要說到「天然比不得」，却又不對了，便是成見，也並不是永不能化除的，像目前的先施樂園大京班，所聘的重要演員，就都是從前舞台上的人物：若王其昌，乃是老伶工王鴻之子，工演金錢豹，反五關，焚棉山，周瑜歸天，及紅生戲；若胡玉樓，是老伶工譚月明的得意弟子，為靠把專工，擅演挑華車，八大錘等戲；若夏君庭，是夏月珊之孫，夏蔭培之侄，為短打激烈武生之錚錚者；若趙奎官，則為北派二花，南方不可多。他們都是名伶，而現在却都就聘先施樂園了；一方面固然是先施樂園放出異彩，一方面名伶能化除不可思議的成見，聯帶化除社會人士以為遊藝塲大京班天然比不得舞台的成見，却是很令人欽佩的！</p>
<p>世界珍聞</p>
<h3>日本的關稅壁壘</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>西洋製造的照相機，鏡頭，軟片等攝影用具，一百元的原價，便要謀百圓的稅金。譬如在日本購買的二百元照相機，內中的稅金要佔五十元至七十元。旅客到日本去只能帶一隻陳舊的照相機。到輪船邊接送朋友，一定要將照相機帶到稅關的檢查所去登記，否則回來經過檢查所的時候，有被指為私運而沒收的危險。據稅關職員說：「照相機的關稅過大，時常有走私的，舊貨易漏綱。」但是此種走私，大都是貪便宜，多帶一二架是有的，像我國的大規模有組織的走私，是全世界所未見的。</p>
<p>照原價抽稅的東西，並非照相材料一類，約計百種以上。最主要的是中國酒，啤酒，毛皮，麥稈帽子，金質眼鏡鐘錶，留聲機，洋傘玩具等，近幾年來此種貨物幾乎絕跡了。中國酒分五茄皮，高粱，紹興二種，有日本商店在天津改裝運銷，裝璜得和啤酒瓶一樣。台灣在試驗製造紹酒，味兒淡而帶澀。一個滿是綵花的紹酒麥，由舊貨店出售與日本酒店做裝飾，尚且要買四五元。如若內中放滿了酒，那是其價可觀了。</p>
<p>昭和七年「從量稅」實施之後，有的以斤両計算，有的用個數計算，於是有幾種稅金又加高了三成五，例如一輛機器腳踏車，原來是九十三元六角的稅金，現在巳成了百二十六元三角六分。照這樣生産率的貨物，約有八百餘種，於是舶來品的價格，不能不貴了。在上海購買一個中國貨的熱水瓶，只有半塊錢；到日本去配一個中間的玻璃瓶，却要一元。運到中國來的日本貨，反而比在日本購買便宜，這是常有的。</p>
<p>日本自從施行「金輸出再禁止」之後；日金匯兌崩落至三分之一，美國一金元，約和日金二元相等，現在日金百元，僅值美金二十元。因此再加上關稅之後，歐美貨物就是能照章輸入日本，也將無人購買了。我國關稅因某種有關係，尚不能完全自主，所以稅金較各國為低。况且銀價高漲之後，對外國貨物輸入是十分有利，直接妨礙於國貨的命運；而尚有人批評我國關稅過高，那真是很可憐的事情了。</p>
<p>人物小誌</p>
<h3>八秩大慶的蕭伯納</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>當代英國戲劇作家，被稱為幽默大師的蕭伯納，今年巳八十歲了，七月二十六日便是他的誕辰。但這次他的八秩大慶，並不受任何禮物，而且在誕辰的前夜，更拒見賓客，獨個子到墨爾飛戲院裏去參觀上演他的劇作Saint　Joan。</p>
<p>蕭老頭子在一八五六年七月二十六日誕生於英國都伯林地方，他所寫的劇本，時常冠以自己所寫的長篇序文。他在一八六七年到倫敦開始做電話公司裏的職員，一八八四年加入社會主義的泛平協會，在各種雜誌上投稿。一八九五年在禮拜六雜誌上發表劇評，他老早就在宣揚易卜生主義，畢生所寫的劇本很多，而且他的劇本，更大半在歐洲各國的舞台上面演過而有過相當成績的。他在當代英國的文學界中，的確可稱一員鬥將，除了寫作劇本之外，他更發表過不少有關政治經濟方面的著作。</p>
<p>我們如果不是健忘的話，那麽便會記憶到一九三三年的春天，他周遊世界的一回，曾經到過上海。那時上海方面的文化界，更會表示過相當的歡迎，不過那一回蕭氏在上海祇短短的逗留了三四天，便北上而轉道往日本去的。他在日本，曾經發表過幽默的談話，指示為恐怖的國土，對於日本人曾經下過一次不客氣的教訓。</p>
<p>他雖然是一個戲劇作家，但他不喜歡投資於劇塲，戲院，直至現在，他還是固執着「一個戲劇作家不應投資於劇塲」的信念。這原因，最近他有一位經營露天劇塲的朋友寫信去，要他投資合夥，他在回信中，非但不允投資，而且又用了幽默的語氣，把他的朋友大大的諷刺一頓。</p>
<p>他的修性奇特，他的思想超人，所以對於現社會是什麽都表示不滿。他自己雖然是個社會主義的信徒，但他對各國共産黨的行為往往另以指摘的。他曾痛斥墨索里尼為一輛破舊的汽車，祇會說大話，不會做大事。他所寫的劇本更不贊同被好萊塢的影片公司搬上銀幕，因為怕公司方面編成電影劇本之後，他的對白完全不用。</p>
<p>現在這蕭老頭子雖然巳八十歲了，但他的精神還是和過往一樣的矍鑠，不和人談話便罷，和人談話，一出口就是幽默的語氣，滑稽突梯，非使你狂笑不可，而且笑裏藏刀，辩辩口味，他的話又處處在諷刺你，真會使人哭笑不得呢！</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第六回　鐵面見親心語瞞鸚鵡　峨眉存俠氣問典崑崙</p>
<p>夢蘭聽着這話，點點頭自回房去了。在這日下午以後，夢蘭自己，也不知道是得了一種什麽病了，只深得是坐立不安，勉強的拿起一本書來看，那書上是些什麽字跡，也全是分辨不出來的。為了省事起見，只有推着有病，在樓上可以不下來，家庭對於自己，是否有什麽態度表示，也就在所不問了。這樣問守了兩天，鬧得除了父親而外，男男女女，都到樓上來問他的病。可是見了面之後，除掉看到他兩眉深鎖而外，只有臉上不搽脂粉，略帶了焦黃，還算是病態。大家也就明白，也患的是心病。不過這心病，大家還只猜到一半，以為是那幾件嫁衣促成的而巳。能猜着多一點的，還只有那位女同學李友梅女士。到了第三日下午李友梅又來了，一進門，看到夢蘭手撐了桌子，托住了自己的頭，身上穿了一件極單薄的八成舊青湖縐夾襖，越是顯出那單怯怯的樣子來。在房門口就站着，笑道：林妹妹的病可好些了，寶玉來了。夢蘭回過頭來看到，就笑道：你還沒有進門，先就同我開玩笑。友梅進來，兩手同時握住他的兩隻手，對了他臉上望着。因微皺了眉道：你臉上的病容，還是很濃厚。夢蘭笑道：在你未看到我以前，你倒以為我是假病嗎？友梅笑道：我們的江小姐，怎麽開口就言中帶刺。說着，又用手輕輕的拍了他的肩膀，因筆道：但是我並不怪你。你滿腹全是不快活，那牢騷是一觸即發的呢。夢蘭同他斜把了一張桌子角，苦笑着坐下。問道：你怎麽知道我病了？大概因為我三天沒有上學，特意來問我的吧？友梅笑道：不，我還有一點兒私事，來請教於你。夢蘭笑道：你所知道的事情，比我多之又多了，倒來請教於我。什麽事？說到這裏，小菊捧着茶壺來倒茶，友梅且不答復他的話，將桌上的紙條，抽一塊到面前，然後提筆在上面寫了五個字，崑崙媽磨勒。接着用筆在五個字帝邊，密密的圈了一路圈圈，仰看臉笑問道：這個典故，我不大明白，你能不能告訴我？夢蘭見小菊斟了兩杯茶在桌上，巳是站到一邊，看了人微笑，便道：小鬼！下樓去罷，你又打算在這裏聽些什麽新聞？小菊看道：我有一篇論說，打算要用這樣一個典，又恐怕用得不大妥當。（七五）</p>

<p>電信特栞</p>
<h3>新章實行後收發報人值得注意的幾點</h3>
<p>— 葆眞</p>
<p>新訂華文電報收報地名及收報人住址名稱計費章則，（以下簡稱新章）為本年度電政方面之一種新設施，對於公衆在在發生密切關係。愛將收發報人値得注意的幾點縷述如次：</p>
<p>一，收報人姓名住址不宜過於簡略　自九月一日起實行新章以來，一般發報人因新章內規定，各種華文電報之收報人住址名稱，連同收報地名之字數以二字作一字計費，往往將收報人住址名稱字數儘力設法减少，或僅書收報人名稱而略去住址，以圖節省報費。按照現行國內電報營業通則第三十五條之規定，發報人對於收報人之住址及名稱，均須詳細開明。發報人如將收報人住址名稱書寫過於簡略或僅書收報人名稱而無住址，不但有違上項規定，且難免有延誤情事。因我國商人慣用泰，大，興，盛，昌，隆，康等字為商號名稱，而人民之姓名過於普通者，亦恒有雷同，故比較通俗之商號名稱，如「泰昌」「大盛」「華興」「泰康」「福隆」及比較普通之姓名，如「張英」「王國棟」等等在同一地方，往往不止一個。僅有收報商號名稱而無住址之電報，例如「鎭江大盛，及收報人住址欠詳之電報，例如「靑島肥城路張英」，鎭江或靑島電局收到上項來電，雖可設法探送，惟在鎭江一埠同名「大盛」之商號或有數家之多，靑島肥城路住戶名「張英」者或亦不止一人，殊難免不發生誤送誤收情事，或因轉輾探送而稽延報差遞電時刻，故發報人萬萬不可貪圖節省數字報費之小便宜，而致貽誤事機，有失拍發電報之本旨也。</p>
<p>二，華文收報地名及住址名稱之計字收費辦法二十四年九月交通部電政司刋印之國內電報營業通則，對於華文電報之收報地名及住址名稱，係分別計字收費（例如華文明語尋常電之收報地名，不論幾字，槪按二字收費，其住址名稱不逾十三字者作三字計費），此次改訂之華文電報住址名稱計費辦法，係將收報地名暨收報人住址名稱，按實有之字數，一併以二字作一字計費。例如「齊齊哈爾東大街（二五三）號華祖國」共有十二字，應作六字計費。此項計字收費辦法較之舊章更為簡單。</p>
<p>三，電報掛號之優點收報人在電局納費掛號之動機與目的為利己利入。掛號之手續至為簡單，祇須由收報人擇定一字向當地電局照章納費掛號後，所有各地發寄該收報人之電報，均可用該項掛號字代替收報人姓名住址，在發報人方面不但可省若干字之報費，且可减少詳細書寫收報人住址名稱之煩，增進繕發電報之速率不少。在收報人方面？旣已在電局掛號，可將擇定之掛號字，刋於廣吿內或印於信卦信紙上，作為一種商業上之宣傳，且拍發同電或發電致他人時，均可用該項掛號字代替本人之署名，祇須按一字付費，較之用全名為經濟。又簡短之掛號電報，在電局方面所費傳遞時間較少，故收發報人用掛號字收發電報，無形中增進電報之速率甚大。新章實行後，一部份發報人因收報人住址名稱簡短之華文電報，其住址名稱字數僅有六七字，以二字作一字計費，亦祇須付三字或四字報費，較之用掛號字並不如何吃虧，或將不復使用掛號字。殊不知捨掛號字不用，則上述種種便利，不能享受，而發報時，必須考慮收報人住址名稱如何簡略書寫，方可减少字數，然住址名稱欠詳之電報，殊易發生誤投誤收或稽延情事，故發報人仍以使用掛號字為宜。</p>
<p>四，本省或出省電報價目之標準　國內電報價目現已改為本省出省兩種。凡本省境內往來之電報，按本省價目收費，發往他省之電報照出省價目收費，至為簡單明顯。惟郵轉或專送電報，因須由距離收報人所在地最近之電局送交郵局轉遞或由電局僱差專送，其收報人所在地與發報局雖屬於同一省區，例如北平發往南宮之郵轉或專送電報，（按北平與南宮均屬河北省），然該電於其傳遞之過程中，須經山東之德州電局接轉，故電局對於此項電報，究應如何核收報費，似覺稍有出入。但該電之收報人所在地點之「南宮」，旣與發報地點之「北平」，均係同屬於河北省，該電自應仍照本省價目計費。反之，如收報人所在地點屬於他省，雖由本省電局交郵轉遞或僱差專送，電局仍須按照出省價目計費。所謂本省出省價目之區別，當以收報人所在地點為標準也。</p>
<h3>長途電話新業務之試辦</h3>
<p>自九省長途電話工程吿竣各省通話地點先後開放後，我國長途電話事業，已趨於發展時代。利用者多，手續應求簡便，然後業務始能發達，理勢然也。</p>
<p>依規定手續：凡欲傳發長途電話者，除傳呼通話外，例須於掛號時報朋對方之電話號碼，如發話人祇知受話人名稱及住址，而不明其電話號碼，卽不能申請掛號，亦卽無法與之通話。</p>
<p>又預告通話，如因指定之受話人不在，致未能通話者，卽由發話人納費銷號。如發話人必須通話者，勢必再請預告通話，時間與話費，均不經濟。</p>
<p>交通部為便利民衆推廣營業起見，茲有下列兩點之改進：</p>
<p>（一）發話人如祗知受話用戶名稱及住址，而不明其電話號碼，亦得聲請掛號。如所報受　用戶，經查明並未裝有電話，或所裝電話業巳更名過戶，或共名稱與號簿所載不符，無法查明，致不能接通者，一律准予免費銷號。</p>
<p>（二）關於預吿電話，發話人掛號時，得同時聲請：「如指定之受話人不在，致未能通話時，卽由電局通知受話用戶轉知受話人：發話人盼共於某時至某時間回一電話。」發話局接受該項聲請後，應通知受話局照辦。受話局喚呌時，如指定之受話人不在，應隨卽將發話人所在地及其姓名，住址，或電話號碼，通知受話用戶，請其轉知受話人，遵照發話人之意旨，按時回一電話，一面知照發話局，請發話人照章繳納銷號費，母須繳納通話費。以上兩項辦法，聞定於十月一日起，就京滬滬漢兩直達電路，先行試辦云。</p>
<h3>最近電報業務之改進種種</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>一，飭知各局慎重電碼訛誤</p>
<p>交通部電政司近以坊間刋物，問有刋布電碼及電報規則者，因編校疎忽，每有訛誤，用者不察，輒至誤事。特通飭各局，嗣後翻譯電碼，應一律依用交通部編印之明密電碼新編，母得再用他種電本，以資準確，而利業務。</p>
<p>二，報差應盡力設法探送電報</p>
<p>查收報人姓名住址，常有錯誤，或移動悄事，報差投送時，因限於時刻，往往不能盡力探投，致電報無由達到。電司為改善起見，爰飭各局，嗣後報差投送電報，收報人姓名住址如有錯誤，應盡力設法探投，不得稍有推諉。惟於回局時，可將探投情形，報吿派送員，經查核屬實後，得將該次送報限回時問註銷，並於送報稽查表內，詳註備查。</p>
<p>三，處理無法投送電報</p>
<p>查處理無法投送電報，向無一定手續，諸多不便。茲經訂定處理無法投送電報辦法一種，凡各局遇有無法投送之電報，除應將不能投送原因，以公電通知發報局轉知發報人並登記備查外，並應按照下列各項分別同時處理：（一）按照原開收報人之姓名地址，查明地段，向該地段郵局郵差，詳細探詢：（二）如收報人地址簡略無法查明郵局地段者，可向當地最高郵局，設法探詢：（三）開具電報招領通吿，揭示局門。除照上項辦法辦理外，並應婉商當地中西各報館，免費刊登招領電報新聞。</p>
<p>四，規定經國際無綫電發往坎拿大電報之路由</p>
<p>關於經由國際無綫電發往坎拿大各處電報之路由，電司曾於七月沁代電飭自卽日起，發報人對於經國際無綫電發往坎拿大各處之電報，如指明經美國無錢電交通公司及坎拿大太平洋電報公司電路傳遞者，Via　Rca　and　CanadianPacific　Telegraphs可予照收。惟須加註Via　Cgra-Rca　and　Cpr路由標識，以資識別。其僅指明經交通公司電路傳遞者，仍舊用Via　Cgra-Rca路由標識。</p>
<p>五，推廣成文交際電報　　成文交際電報，係將慶賀或弔慰事項，用成語分類編成電文，印在交際電去報紙底面，發報人僅須指定願發何組電文，發報局卽按該組號碼傳遞，收報局則按該組電文送逹收報人，非常便利。惟上項成文交際電去報紙未經寄到以前，不能開放該項業務。除江蘇等電政管理局所轄各局業經開放外，聞交部令發廣東甘寗兩管理局之交際電報規則及交際電去報紙等，均已寄到，各局對於發往粵甘兩區各局之成文電文交際電，自八月一日起，一律收發云。</p>
<h3>交通部辦長途電話擴展之近况（續）</h3>
<p>（二）省區幹綫</p>
<p>前列各幹綫與其聯絡綫有全綫均已聯絡互通者有僅屬各該錢之一段已聯絡互通其餘各處尙未聯通者，其詳細情形，不及備載，（編者按：本日本報第二版刋載交通部長途電話幹綫聯絡通話廣吿可供讀者參閱）（完）</p>

<h3>安徒生童話的教育價值</h3>
<p>— 錚</p>
<p>—餘年前，在新聞的中國兒童文學花園裏，會經由幾個園丁，從丹麥移植了一株馨　燦爛的花來。經過一番藝術地培植之後，不到三五年，便盛開起來，誘致了一切天眞活發的遊客，使他們歡喜讚嘆不止。——這是安徒生童話傳入我國後的最幸邋的時期。</p>
<p>到了最近幾年，這株奇花好像逢到了秋氣的蕭瑟，一天天地枯寂下去了。人們見着它，開始搖起頭來，更有人說它只有「藝術」的美色和香味，却沒有實際的教育效益；甚至有人說它的色香會毒害一般年輕的遊客。</p>
<p>為什麼它會遭遇這種惡邋的呢？</p>
<p>原來自從它傳入中國以後，一般批評者全從表面上去恭維它。說作者的藝術手腕怎樣巧妙，寫作方法如何高明，思想如何天眞，字句如何活潑，……等。一開始就很少有人注意到每篇作品中的深密的寓意，與豐富的教育價値。甚至說他為了要求寫作藝術的成功，故意拋却一切含有教育價値的材料。這眞是一種吃力不討好的偏畸的褒獎。他們為要過分提示它的一半的價値，反把它的另一半更重要的價値抹煞了。——道就是使人不久就厭棄它的一個大原因。</p>
<p>其實，我們只要細心地去玩味，不過分在他的字句和文法上去注意，我們就很容易看出他在每篇童話裏所含的深刻的意味：</p>
<p>第一，關於「愛」的啓發。這幾乎是他每篇作品中都有的原素。而是別的童話中不大找得到的。他常有這一類的句子：「雨雲剛替苧蔴洗過臉，太陽射在上面，正好像小孩洗過臉，母親給他接個吻一般。」他在那篇「一個母親的故事」裏，寫一個小孩被死神帶去後，母親出外找尋，遇見一叢荊棘，便向他問路，，荊棘要她把胸膛緊貼在荊棘叢上，使他溫煖了，纔肯吿訴她。母親便把胸膛緊貼在荊棘叢上，使牠溫煖；荊棘刺進她的肉，使她淌出大滴的鮮血來。但是荊棘却得了溫煖抽出綠葉，在黑暗的冬夜裏又開花了。「一個母親的心是這麼溫煖呀」！後來她又為了向湖水問路，情願哭出兩粿明亮的眼珠來給他。向一個老太婆問路，惰願割下一頭黑髮。她向死神哭着要孩子，說：「還我孩子來！」她恨極了，要拔去大溫室裏一切的花，但是，</p>
<p>死神說：「不要動牠們，你說你是這麼的不快活，可是你把牠們拔掉，會使別的母親也要一樣的不快活了。」</p>
<p>「別的母親嗎？」可憐的母親這樣說着，便把手放下了。</p>
<p>為了自己的孩子，她情願犧牲一切；但為了大家的母親，她只好饒恕了罪惡的死神。這裏所暗示給孩子們的「愛」的觀念是多麼深刻而偉大啊！任憑怎樣硬心腸的孩子，看了這個故事，也定會從他們心的深處，引出同情之淚來吧！他又啓示給他的小讀者：一切的愛是應該平等的，不分貧富，沒有高低‘他說；「星光照着一切的屋子，照在富家上，也照在貧家上，一樣光明，一樣幸福。」他說：「日光和開花的蘋菓枝接吻，又和田裏的黃蒲公英接吻。他們都是弟兄，日光和他們接吻——可憐的花與富麗的花是一樣的。」當一般小讀者讀到這種地方時，他們的心裏將要受到怎樣的感動呢？這種感動將會收到多麼優良的效果呢？</p>
<p>第二，「智慧」的啟發。他在那篇「那是的確的」中，寫一隻母雞無意中啄落一根羽毛，被旁人看見，經過幾次傳說後，竟變成「五隻母雞為了戀愛一隻公雞，把羽毛統統啄去而死了」。這不是明白地吿訴了孩子們，社會上有許多道廳途說的事是靠不住的嗎？當然，我們知道連許多報紙上記載的新聞都是靠不住的，但孩子們不會知道這許多，那麼借着個有趣的故事去啓發他們，不是很應該的嗎？他又在「跳蛙」裏寫：跳蚤·呌哥哥·跳蛙比賽誰跳得高。跳蚤和呌哥哥只會　跳，結果一個跳得不見了，一個竟跳到國王的臉上。都落了選。跳蛙是個有思想的，牠從斜刺裏一跳，跳到公主的圍裙上；那時公主正坐在矮凳上。於是，</p>
<p>國王說：「沒有比我的女兒更高的了，他却跳在伊的上面，所以他是最高的，只有那有思想的纔會想得到，娃使我們知道他是有思想的，他有腦子，他應該得公主。」</p>
<p>這個故事從表面看來，似乎每一句都很滑稽。幼稚。但任何孩子讀完這故事後，除了發出一陣愉快的喀笑外，定會用嚴重的態度去探究跳蛙的所以能够得公主的原因，於是「因為他是有思想的，有腦子的」這兩句話，深深地印在他們的腦子裏了。換句話說，這故事已暗示了他們：任何高貴難得的事物，只要是肯用思想肯用腦子的，總可以到得成功。這不是一個很嚴正的教訓嗎？</p>
<p>對於這種寓意的表現蘊儲的方法，安徒生確是最用苦心的，他有時選取了幽默的故事材料，把其中教訓的成份故意加以適當的隱藏，使故事顯得更加有趣，而讓教訓在無形中給讀者吸收了去。如「皇帝的新衣」就是一個很好的例子。（這原是從曼諾爾（Don　Maonel）的「盧堪諾爾伯爵」（Cunt　Luoanor）脫胎而來。作者改編方法的巧妙，顧均正先生的「安徒生傳」和趙景深先生的「童話論集」裏都有提及。）他把原來故事中過於顯露，不易使兒童吸收的教訓，隱藏在更幽默更有趣的文字裏；却加深了諷刺。不但說出這皇帝的愚蠢·腐敗·無能，並且暗示了無謂的「浮華」原是自欺欺人的事。這也是可以使孩子們在無形中得到領悟的。</p>
<p>第三，「善」的啟發。在安徒生童話中，有幾篇常帶有愛　先訶和託爾斯泰等童話的作風，却含有格林童話的趣味。這對於兒童德性的啟發，實有一種意想不到的效力。他往往藉着譏駡兇惡者，來引誘兒童的「善」心。他在「壞國王」中，寫一個無惡不作的國王，常常率領着粗暴的兵士到處攻打劫掠，人人怕他。有時打收了　國，必盡奪其財，還把那國的國王縛回宮裏，令他跪在自己或臣子的脚下，給他們端送食物。後來他傲慢得要征服上帝了。但第一次，被天使用大火燒得半死；第二次，他在七年間造了無數的飛船，準備大舉進攻。當他剛要上船的時候，忽然飛來許多蚊子，紛紛來刺國王；國王大怒，身邊的劍也失了效力，便令人拿一幅貴重的蚊帳來，把身子捲在裏面，但仍有一隻蚊子鑽子進去，飛入國王的耳朶、裏亂刺；於是國王的腦子中了毒，撕開蚊帳，裂開衣服，裸着身子，在兵隊面前跳起舞來，引得兵士們都哈哈大笑。結尾他說：「國王要想戰勝上帝，却這樣地被一個蚊子所敗」。在這裏，他不但儘力把一個兇殘無道的昏君斥責了一番，並且還要引起小讀者們跟着兵士一同向那昏君嘲笑，使他們不知不覺地說：「誰教他這樣壞」！同時，在他們的心裏便受了一個「不可太壞」的教訓。在前一段裏寫他虐待戰敗國國王的地方，更可以引起他們對於弱者的同情和知道亡國的慘痛。</p>
<p>在他的童話中，關於諷駡驕傲者的地方特別多，也許為了他要一吐從前到處碰壁的悶氣。但其中蘊藏着的教育價値不還是一樣的嗎？</p>
<p>此外，他的童話中含有大衆思想的也很有幾篇，如「賣火柴的女兒」「燭」「天使」「有等級呢」等，都是很値得介紹給兒童們一讀的。</p>
<p>總之，他的童話絕不只是一種看過就了的消閒品，他的第一本童話發表時，他已經在人世間遭受了三十年的磨難，飽經了人世的風霜。其中有悲哀的故事，甜蜜的夢幻。因此，他不得不藉着旅行來安慰自己的餘生。他把歷年體騐的世故和受到的教訓，都交織在他那優美的童話裏。它們不但把握住了幼小者的心，還想在他們未去受世間的磨難之前，先給他們一番改造：使男的更加剛强，女的更加柔美。誰說安徒生童話沒有教育價値呢？</p>
<h3>處處蟲聲喞喞正是研究昆蟲的季節</h3>
<p>— 高文蘭</p>
<p>一到秋天的晚上，牆角邊，草叢中，竹籬上，處處都充滿着「瞿瞿瞿唧唧唧」的聲音，這聲昔就是秋蟲的樂隊，牠們各自奏着牠們美妙的音樂，把一個冷靜而足以引起人家悲思的秋夜，弄得十分熱鬧。所以無論是大詩人或是普通人，大家都對秋蟲有着一種好感。</p>
<p>秋蟲眞是値得研究的一種昆蟲，即使你不想做昆蟲學專家不願用心思去研究，那你大槪終也愛捉幾個來養在案頭，以破寂寞而供欣賞的吧！那麼，我來介紹你讀一下「鳴蟲之話」，因為，這本書是對於你研究秋蟲或是欣賞秋蟲都有着極大的帮助的。</p>
<p>這本書共分三章，第一章是總說鳴蟲的發音及意義，第二章是夏日的嗚蟬，第三章是秋夜的鳴蟲。先用科學的研究，把一種鳴蟲的形態，生活，習慣作一個介紹，再從文學的趣味和音樂的實感，對鳴蟲作一賞鑑的考察，中間附有不少嗚蟲嗚呌的聲音的曲譜，讀者可以按譜研究其嗚聲的高低疾徐。最後說明秋蟲的捕捉和飼養方法，如果我們依照了這方法去捕捉幾個來飼養在案頭，淸夜書齋伴讀，一定另有特別的趣味。</p>
<p>似乎秋天是昆蟲的世界，不僅隨處充滿着昆蟲的樂隊，就是不是音樂家的昆蟲也特別多。當你在晚上燃燈夜讀或是寫作文章的時候，就有不少的昆蟲，大的小的，黑的綠的，葉飛到燈到，像是伴你的寂寥，又像是擾亂你的工作。你當然，感到這些昆蟲很討厭，恨不得用一種什麼方法，把牠們一個一個撲盡。然而這種昆蟲是可憐者，牠們感到黑暗的痛苦，所以拚命飛向燈光之下，欣喜的跳着舞着，牠們的生命，也就在這一夜裏結束了。就是長命的，也不過延長到一二日而已。因為牠們是可憐的短命者，我們也就沒有多大的意味去研究牠，我們可以除了鳴蟲之外研究別種壽命較長的昆蟲，那麼，我來介紹你讀一下「昆蟲的生活」及「昆蟲漫話」兩書。這兩本書，內中釵述的昆蟲，有的是富有社會組織性的，有的是有益人類的，有的是比野獸還要殘忍的，有的是比世界亞林匹克運動會跳高跳遠的健將成績還要超過的，有的是有害於人的，形形色色，讀之如走進了昆蟲展覽會中，遇見了一個白鬚老人的法國昆蟲學專家法布爾先生，十分誠懇的一一為我們指導着一樣。「昆蟲的生活」一書，用了趣味的筆調，先用科學研究來說明牠的一切，再用文學的趣味來寫述與人類有關的故事；「昆蟲漫話」一書，將每一種昆蟲，詳述其種類及生活習性，係一本所謂科學小品文，也是一本研究昆蟲的專書。</p>
<p>研究一種學問，時令是極有關係的，所以一般的教科書中，總是春天講梅花，夏天講荷花，决沒有夏天講梅花春天講荷花的。這就是一個時令關係，便於人家的研究的緣故。秋天是研究昆蟲的季節，所以現在的時候，閱讀這幾本書，當感得格外的有趣味。如果你是喜歡捕捉鳴蟲來飼養的話，那更不能不把這幾本書置在案頭，時時翻閱。</p>
<h3>青年人的知識養料</h3>
<p>— 魏鏘鈴</p>
<p>從前曾經熱鬧過一時的科學小品，現在似乎像大雨後的魚兒，一點蹤跡也沒有了。</p>
<p>我很希望書店裏有這類作品出現，來滿足我的求知慾。有時看到我所不懂的東西，作者用生動而明白的筆調，曲曲寫出的時候，我是怎樣的驚喜呢！</p>
<p>每逢星期日下午，前面有着糖果似的，誘引我到各大書局去搜索一番這類作品。</p>
<p>「終於給我我到了」，在開明書店的書櫃裏，發見了蘇聯靑年作家伊林著的四本書，這幾本書像幾個活潑淘氣的孩子，一齊張開了手臂在那裏笑。我驚喜地拿起一本較厚的「人和山」，翻開來看。知道牠是講怎樣運甩人類的能力跟自然鬥爭，以科學的法則，操縱自然力，使自然力順從人的意志的鬥爭。改造沙漠·創造新植物·製迭活地圖·駕馭河流·以及改變天氣的試騐；說明了自然力不是可怕的東西，而是可親愛的我們的富源，而全在人類的利用。他以輕靈生動的筆調像一位哥哥寫給弟妹們讀的親切而週到的說述。眞可笑，那時我竟忘記了自己是在書店的櫃身邊了，一口氣看了二·三章，終於由佔有慾的驅使，「寗可受凍」！我將家裏寄給我做秋衣的錢，分出一部份，把這四本心愛的書買了回來。用了一個星期的晚上，探險似地把牠們都讀完了。原來另外的三本，一樣很親切地告訴我所不知道的許多豐富的知識。</p>
<p>我覺得我的行為沒有錯，也沒有上書店的當；因為我得到些從前所沒有的豐當的知識。</p>
<p>還幾本書最大的成功，能把複雜。奧妙的事物，簡單明白地講出來，用淺顯生動的筆緻，描寫世界的眞相。</p>
<p>房龍是以歷史的立場，來寫人類的進化，容易使人生平凡之感；法布爾是用對話體來寫自然科學，要使人去深刻地領會；到了伊林，却另有描寫的手腕，他用生動的故事體描寫難懂的新興科學，能抓住讀者的全神，這是他比二人進步的地方。他所著書，是我們靑年人知識的養料，我們需要這類寫法的書，我不禁這樣想。</p>
<p>編者按：伊林著的四本科學故事，都由董純才先生重譯為國文，在開明書店出版。第一種「十萬個為什麼」，實價三角五分；其餘「人和山」「黑白」「幾點鐘」三種，現售特價，請查閱廣吿。</p>

<p>開明書店印行的「新少年」半月刋，發行以來，極為一般少年讀者所歡迎。該刊編者原有每年另印「別册附錄」一種，分贈該刊定戶的計划。作為發刊第一年內別册附錄的，原擬在當代許多作家的作品中，選集一些適宜於少年讀者的文章，定名「新少年讀本」，供給新少年閱讀。不料着手選集後，感覺這工作並不怎麼容易。因為專供少年閱讀的讀本，第一，所選文章必須以少年為對象；第二，所選文章必須對於少年有直接的效益。如果不能做到這兩層，選集工作就成為無意義。於是改變方針，請各位作家照前面的兩個標準自己選定一篇；並給加上「題記」，語明道篇文章的動機·要旨·等等，使讀者更親切的理解。現已有二十位當代作家的文章，用新四號字排成二百面左右，單獨裝成一册，定於雙十節出版，和二卷七期的「新少年」同時寄贈給定戶。這讀本專贈一新少年」定戶，是「非賣品」。要想得到它的，請趕快定閱「新少年」半月刊。「新少年」半月刋本來是全國少年的最良好的定期刊物呢。</p>
<p>二，「制言」第二十五期出版</p>
<p>太炎先生紀念專刊</p>
<p>章太炎先生下居吳下，創辦章氏國學講習會；同時出版「制言」半月刊，由講習會負責編輯。其中撰述人員，均屬著名作家。發刋以來，海內外學者，咸以先覩為快。近太炎先生謝世，門下諸君，稟承顧命，續辦講習會，並續刋「制言」。將以九月十六日第二十五期特出「太炎先生紀念專刋」。篇幅增多，的至四倍。其中最有價値之作，為太炎先生最後遺著「古文尙書拾遺」定本，太炎先生自述學術次第。自本期專刋起，上海南京漢口長沙北平廣州六處，統由開明書店總代發行。專刋定價六角，預定全年二十四期三元，半年十二期一元六角，特刋不另加價。期刋零售每册一角五分。</p>
<p>三，關於「章氏業書」</p>
<p>章氏叢書前有浙江圖書館木刻本流傳於世。北平吳檢齋先生等又刋章氏叢書續編，以補正編之缺，所收有「太史公古文尙書說」「古文尙書拾遺」「春秋左氏疑義答問」「菿漢昌言」等，而「新出三體石經攷」一卷，由章氏弟子錢玄同氏手寫影印，彌足珍貴。茲者，章氏門弟子又有章氏叢書三編之輯，將合併正編·續編，交山上海開明書店出版，並依法呈請內政部註冊矣。聞正續兩編决取初印本縮製鋅版，並山蘇州章氏國學講習會諸君將正編加以斷句（按續編本已斷句）；三編則由開明書店精密排校。一俟全書製版排校竣事，即當特價發售云。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>希特勒的名言</h3>
<p>— 芳</p>
<p>十日德國社黨開第八屆常年大會，希特勒登臺發表重要演說，首稱大凡世界一切偉大的鬭爭，扼要言之，不外入類保守的本能，舉民族求生的趨勢，降至現代，一切鬭爭，推决本源，亦無非若干民族求生的目的有以决之，希特勒這番演說，眞是扼要得很，我不特百二十分的贊同，幷且要二百四十分的贊同。</p>
<p>現在的世界，完全是一個强權的世界，你有幾多力量，幾多勢力，便能保守幾多地盤，你沒有力量，沒有勢力，便是你應該保守的土地，也不能保，假定你力量充足，勢力偉大，儘可拿傍人的地盤，作為自己的地盤，所謂弱肉强食的世界，便是現在的世界。</p>
<p>但是生存有兩種生存，一種是强者的生存，一種是弱者的生存，强者的生存，以固有的地盤為未足，於是尋求殖民地，或討還殖民地，以充實他們滋養的原料，養活他們的老百姓，但是弱者，也應求生存，也應保全他固有的地盤，與固有的生存的滋養料，本來世界上有所謂公理，公法，到了現在，談不到所謂公理公法，祇有生存，祇有强權，强權之外無他事矣。</p>
<p>本來有所謂國際法庭，’國聯盟約，海軍公約，軍縮會議，及一切盟的條文，表面上還來維持，現在多扯破了，撕廢了，付諸東洋大海了，一切的一切，惟有强權是務，故現在抬頭起來看看世界各國，那一國不在整軍經武，那一個不在擴張軍備，故日本人說，一國之內，他國不容置喙，美國人說，其軍裝將以天為限，此說眞是不差，强權的世界，只有強權來對付。</p>
<p>但是我國用强權，他國也用强權，以强權對付强權，則强權天然也有差別，所謂强人自有强人制，假定本來不講强權的，天然為强權所吃癟，假定好講强權，而能力比較稍决的，又將為較强者所吃癟，但回轉頭來想想，强國要生存，弱國何嘗不要生存，强國要保守，弱國何嘗不要保守，但是弱國拿什麼東西去保守呢？你拿公理來保守呢？公理已逃去世界之外，你拿人道來保守呢？現在是一個非人道的世界，你將拿盟的條文來保守呢？盟的條文已早成廢紙，然則弱國究拿什麼東西去保守呢？曰惟有熟血，惟有黑鐵，惟有全國一致的精神，和堅强不屈的態度，眞所謂你要我的心肝，我要你的五臟，拼一個你死我活，打一個血流成渠，現在的世界，只有如此對付，談不到親善，　不得交好，多是假面具　行騙術　希特勒的話，　是</p>
<h3>短期小學（續）</h3>
<p>— 馬加</p>
<p>明天下午，我便從滬西走到閘北去。我懷着個歡快的心兒，踏進學校。短期小學是不收學費的，並且還送書，筆，墨，給孩子們哩！來讀書的孩子都是窮苦的，那倒是我所歡喜的，他們也受着教育了呵！</p>
<p>還有半小時上課，我胸膛里的心兒在跳着，我想着，我要把他們造成我理想中的小英雄，那些貧苦的孩子們呵！我快要來見你們的面了。</p>
<p>當鈴聲響起來的時候，我的心見跳得更加厲害了。我挾着點名簿，走進課堂。見一批衣衫襤褸的孩子們都坐得像羅漢一樣挺直，他們的眼睛都向我瞧着，——畏怯地瞧着。這使我很有點難過，我對他們高聲歡呼：</p>
<p>「你們不笑笑麼？」</p>
<p>他們有的笑起來了，有的悄悄地說道：「這先生倒很有趣哩！」我開始點名，他們的名字都很普通的，什麼「阿毛」啦，「阿狗」啦，「小狗」啦，「小毛」啦，「和尙」啦！…</p>
<p>課堂門口擁着都是才放學的小學生，他們聽着那只有在家里呌喊的名字，現在居然在踝堂里從先生的嘴巴中呌喊出來，這不得不使他們哄然大笑了。我向他們搖搖頭，然而他們却不理會我，依然笑他們，我有點兒憤憤然了。</p>
<p>為了要曉得那些孩子們家庭里的情况，我便挨决地，耐煩地　問着他們。他們都是　點也不　飾，更不覺得什麼　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　：</p>
<p>「我的爸爸是做裁縫司務的！」</p>
<p>門外那些少爺孩子們又哄然笑起來了，還夾雜着諷刺意味的口調說：「啊：裁縫司務！」我心中非常不快，向他們瞪了瞪眼睛。</p>
<p>第二個回答我的是：—「我的爸爸是做皮匠的！」</p>
<p>門外那些少爺孩子非但哄然大笑，並且還高呌出來：「給我做雙鞋子好不好？」</p>
<p>這一來，我站起來想把那些少爺孩子驅逐開，課堂里的所謂野子們却呌起來了：「曉得你們有綫讀書呀！賣什麼樣呀！……</p>
<p>我忙把課堂的門關了起來，我對他們說：「你們不要吵！我們讀我們的書！我相信，我們雖然只有讀三點鐘的書，可是我們所得到的，一定比他們多哩！小朋友們！只要你們用心！用心呀！……」</p>
<p>「我們要用心！……」</p>
<p>在他們的呌嚷中，我感到一陣失望：可不是嗎？誰把他們隔得那麼遠呀？</p>
<p>是那扇課堂的門嗎？……（完）</p>
<h3>秋日小品</h3>
<p>— 綠葉</p>
<p>秋天，是一個晴朗相思的季節，所不同春夏二季的便是那種特色了。春天雖具着季節的靑春時代的溫柔，然而沒有那秋天的天空高爽而晴朗，使人生出一種深遠慮的戚想。我雖不是騷人墨客，對於秋天的讚頌是憂鬱寄托幽情的季節，　是秋天　　目光　見解</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>第一，秋天也是多雲的時節。間時望雲，確是別有情趣：秋天的雲，像一幅中古時代西班牙風的油畫描摹在天邊，有着豪邁雄渾的情調，於秋天的本身生色不少。樓頭小立，在梧桐樹梢頭遠眺着流盪的舒捲的白雲，停目凝望着它們舒捲在長空，瞬息千變，這也可作秋景之一。</p>
<p>而秋天天空白雲蒼狗難以懸測，一時似牧童和一羣雪白的綿羊徘徊流連在黃昏的海濱，一時却似海上的荒島和風帆點點，已令人摸不準這魔法師神奇的戲法變幻那樣。倘使我們在小樓一壼品茗，縱論看雲的經騐和古今的說。關於雲的持歌。這是只一點而已，那也是淸趣別緻了。這也算看雲的小感吧。</p>
<p>其次，秋天的陽光是明　的，早上　步海濱，在晒着秋天的陽光的海面和金色的貝般上，正明艷柔情地微笑着，可以溫暖了你的心頭。而在枯黃的死　上，在紅色的　尖上，秋天的陽光更爽朗地明艷。在舖着秋天明艷的陽光的幽徑上踟　，一切使你躇躊滿志和沉思，想着童年時代的秋天。……</p>
<p>秋天，至少在我是懷着好感的，令人記憶眷戀。</p>
<h3>生活</h3>
<p>— 佚貝</p>
<p>「人間草」之一</p>
<p>住到這個窮鄉僻壤來，最大的目的，當然是打算對這不調和而難以應付的生活作一次不小的讓步；而出人意料的是，生活的形式，縱然化到了無可再簡陋的，幾乎是近於原始人式的地步，然而外面所襲來的，那惡的世紀的風却依舊沒有减低它底困難之一毫半分。而這裏的風情却又是那麼地閉塞而可厭，至於難以使人相信它底存在。因為，這一個僻塞的角落裏，那山　雲霧，那些人，那些無從捉摸的祈禱與夢，一切都矇上了一層厚厚的，中世紀的愚昧的塵污：在那裏。自然的命運與人類的智慧間的距離是依舊那麼遼遠，人在困苦酷慘的生活中走着無窮盡的泥途，那廣闊無邊的雲與天僅僅給了他們以一種茫茫的無際的感覺，而他們底生活的道路，他們底酷慘的掙扎，也就是那麼茫茫然的，空洞，遼闊，而無際……</p>
<p>然而在這古舊而萎黃的世界之一角裏，聰明的人是也有的，他們從外面廣大的，惡鬥的世界裏拾了一點欺詐與機巧的碎屑，於是，當在惡鬥的繁華的世界裏敗退了下來的時候，他們便悄悄地爬進這「世外」的一角來，建起了教堂，騙來了田莊，帶來了鴉片，白麵與其他，帶來了出奇的賭具，帶來了足以在原始的愚味上再添上人造的愚昧的人生哲學……</p>
<p>而自從我住到這裏來以後，那位終年穿着同一件從「香港」買來的西裝上衣，與那破敝的沒有袋子的長褲的教書的先生，也不得不說是「聰明」人中間的一員了，伕子們都稱他做先生，稱其餘的不可思議的人們做「老爺」等等，因為，慣常，在這一角裏，聰明人是往往駕御在那些「細漢子」底上面的而那位被稱作先生的，他懂得怎樣把自己底生活很快地弄好起來，不但弄「好」而且還要弄得「富足」，而他的確是相當地「富足」了的</p>
<p>初來的時候，據說他曾帶了好些雪亮的銀幣來，他把它們致送給他所精心選擇過了的入，誠如他自己所說，他是不作一件白費的事情的，於是，不久他便把另外的一些錢分開寄存烟館子裏，教堂裏，貧窮的佃法那要…到了第二年，他變了烟館子的老板，教堂的要人，與田地的佔有主了。</p>
<p>誰也想像不出他在夜深人靜，獨個兒在他底沒有窗子的小屋裏把一天，一月，或一年所「掙」下來的大大小小的銀幣一枚一枚地檢點了，又秘密地收藏起來的神情：然而那笑，那些異樣的，也許是稍有一點可怕的微笑是常常刻劃在他底臉上的—那尖而乾枯的臉上，在額上，在嘴角上，刻着明銳得幾乎像木刻的神像那麼的皮膚皺紋，弧形的，那麼刻板而均勻，簡直不像是一個生物所應有的；於是，在一次我底生活衰落得更可怕的時候，他就在那種神情中對我說了那些可怕的「聰明」的話：「呀，您千萬不要着急哪；生活，是不算什麼一回事的，人可不容易餓死。您看，天空中可曾有過餓死而跌落下來的鳥兒的嗎……？」</p>
<p>而眞的，那驕傲的輕鬆的聲音使我感到了不小的驚異。天空中難得有餓跌下來的鳥兒；然爾，在地上，在這人間的地上，我看見整批的人死亡在飢餓中，那是不止一次了。我時時為生活所威脅，因之，當最後，那位先生注意到我手上一枚死守了五年的微小的金質紀念戒指，而提議在我底「危念」中以五枚銀幣和我交換的時候，我也不覺茫然失笑了。過去的紀念値得什麼呢？而生活，當對於一個「聰明」的人顯得「輕易」的時侯，對於一個蠢拙的人就覺得十分繁重了。我喜歡看見生活的輕易，然而，我却更加厭惡那位以鳥兒的譬喻來「安慰」或譏笑我的先生底「聰明」……</p>
<h3>秋雨</h3>
<p>— 耳禾</p>
<p>雨，雨，是的，此刻的窗外正下着瀟瀟的雨…，朋友：你或許在活在都市，或許生活在鄕村，但這，都不礙，總之，你也該在領略着雨。在鄕村，你或許在矮小的用泥土築成的屋子裏吧，或許在古樸的用稻草蓋成的屋子裏吧？在都市，那麼你或許在窄狹的零亂的亭子間裏吧，或許宏敞的壯麗的摩天樓上吧？你許行駛着眉，咬着手指悵悵着那瀟瀟的雨，但瀟瀟的雨並不因你的悵悵而停止，它偏和你作對，只是纖纖的下着，下着…。朋友，你怎樣？這沉重的，困人的愁悶能够承當嗎？我知道你會恨，你或則索性抽起烟來了，看着濃白的烟紋從鼻道裏噴出來，但不幸得很，也許為了烟紋使你沉入舊夢中去了。也許發現了古老的創痕，也許許多褪色的故事又在你的眼際飄舞了，也許釀着濃烈的悲傷呢。是的，我知道，你會喝酒，為的喝酒可以消愁。可是由事實你會證明你自己的受騙。如潮的愁思來得更兇猛了。也許你會無意地哼哼古人的詞句：「酒入愁腸，滴滴化作相思淚」。但，同樣是無補於事。朋友：你怎樣呢？你又該望望窗外的瀟瀟的雨…，但，這回，我知道你不曾　着眉，咬着手指了，因為你沒有焦念，更沒有半點力。你只默默的，你被線綿的感想襲倒了。</p>
<p>於是黃昏來了。在芭蕉，在梧桐葉上，雨聲像蟲聲，淅淅瀝瀝的。你怎樣呢，朋友：也許不經意地把你從前背熟的詞句背出來了：「簾外芭蕉三兩顆，夜深人奈何」！「梧桐更兼細雨，到黃昏點點滴滴，這次第怎一個愁字了得」？但能怎樣呢，朋友，你也許開開門，向外望望，可是庭院是暗沉沉的，只淅淅瀝瀝的雨有時飄上你的襟袖。怎樣呢，朋友：我知道你運是默默的。退到牀上，還是靜靜兒睡腄吧，你閉上眼睛，期待着五巴繽紛的夢，但不一會，你似乎感到眼睛非開不可。眼睛開起來了，一想，夜深了呢，還是睡吧，於是把身子側着，把一切的思想屏除到腦外去，可是腦不聽話，偏偏要想，於是你恨不得摔碎你的腦袋，於是你索性起來了，走到桌子旁邊，也想寫幾句可人的詩句或詞句，你也許寫成了，也許寫不成。於是你想再睡睡看，可是又想起許多事情了，也許想着一個剛剛別離的人，也許想着在多年以前，…想着，想着，朋友：你再能腄嗎？你吟吟「薄衾小枕凉天氣，乍覺別離滋味。展轉數寒更，起了還重睡。畢竟不成眠，一夜長如歲一。你一定以為這就是你自己寫的。也許你喝酒喝得太多了，也許你實在太感傷了，你哭着，咽咽地，像一個有了怨氣沒處發洩的孩子。你吟吟「今夜殘燈斜照處，勞勞，秋雨睛時淚不睛」。你索性不想再睡了。你等着明天的新鮮的陽光吧。</p>
<p>天明了，可是還是瀟瀟的雨…。你將無力地吟着「枕前淚其階前雨，隔個窗兒滴到明。」可是你畢竟太倦了，你像一隻垂斃的寒蝶沒有一絲一毫的力，你躺下，你竟畢了。弁夢中，你也許還是愁鬱的。朋友：秋雨味你也許嘗够了吧？此刻你已有鼾聲了，和着窗外的瀟瀟的雨聲。</p>

<p>曹笑黃玉蜻蜓</p>
<p>中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「啼笑因緣　鞭撻鳳喜」</p>
<p>將軍怒目瞠圓睜的手軌籐鞭樓上行。不防我。昨宵因事天律去。你竟是，背地偷身走出門。咳你這下賤人。抽一鞭。駡一聲。手揮目送不留停。但見他，雪膚雲鬢亂。衣杉不整露胸襟。鳳喜聽。戰競競。滿身香汗直淋淋。隔牆有耳終防覺。窗外豈無竊聽人。誰料是，盛怒將軍聞此語。頓然冷笑二三聲。你心中之事都明白。莫非是，密的佳期續舊情。我想你，蓬巷蝸居身下賤。淸歌檀板作營生。如今不改尋常態。只恐怕，狐尾還防活現狀。只道你。改絃易轍書生扮。變作堂堂女學生。到此地，坐享榮華多富貴。錦衣玉食好歡心。誰知你，一身媚骨天成性。瞞不過，露水姻緣一段情。你竟然，暗中送我綠頭中。蓬蒿不是淸高品。只當得，路柳牆花野草生。燕雀焉能康鳳子。當然沒福做夫人。</p>

<p>麟記（一二二〇）下午九時零五分至十時</p>
<p>開篇「潯陽琵琶」</p>
<p>香山司馬下江州。夜泊潯陽波古頭。送客黯然同惜別。荻花楓葉晚江秋。想我是，自悲宦謪飄萍梗。祖餞登帆水上浮。遙望江水盆浦月。已到了，　史二鼓起譙樓。忽聽得，哀聲　四起調絃索。為問那，何處凄凉似訴愁，故而，賓主尋常鄰舫近。喚教他，移船相見半含羞。一見那，秋娘老大猶丯韻。座上樽添酒一甌。只聽那，自叙生平榮舊夢。奈何是，春花秋目不重留。鵑絃曲按調銀甲。那知道，鴛帳空戀留玉鈎。往事不堪回首望。說不盡，幾番衷曲話從頭。見他是。殘脂賸粉空餘恨。血染羅裙舊石榴。到後來，車馬漸稀悲冷落。怎嫁得，浮梁夫婿去難留。宛比是，秋風捐棄宮　扇。月缺難邀玉斧修。可知道，自古歡塲同宦海。滄桑變易去悠悠。我亦是，天涯一樣　零客。末路知音淚兩眸。但是，江上琵琶千載恨。為勸你，再彈一曲更何求。都只為，卿卿無物重相贈，翻作新腔作歌曲酬。待到那，曲罷酒闌人去後。一聲歸路聽鳴騶。只覺得，紅粉靑衫雙淚流。</p>

<h3>Japanese Envoy Visits Foreign Minister Zhang: Arouses National Government's Attention to the Chengdu Incident, Zhang Explains Previous and Subsequent Handling, Exchanges Views on General Issues</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe, accompanied by Counselor Shimizu and Secretary Suma, visited Foreign Minister Zhang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4:00 PM on the 15th, drawing the National Government's attention to the Chengdu incident and inquiring about the National Government's views on the matter. Zhang expressed regret over the occurrence of this unfortunate incident, detailed the government's previous and subsequent handling of the matter, and expressed hope for a satisfactory resolution. Subsequently, focusing on the Chengdu incident, both sides exchanged views on general issues between China and Japan. The meeting concluded at 6:30 PM. Kawagoe will visit Zhang again on the afternoon of the 16th to continue exchanging views. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe, at 10:00 AM on the 15th, spoke with a reporter from the Central News Agency, with Secretary Shimizu interpreting. The reporter asked whether the ambassador's mission to Nanjing was solely to discuss the Chengdu and Beihai incidents, or whether general Sino-Japanese issues would also be raised for discussion. Kawagoe replied that his main mission in Nanjing was to visit Foreign Minister Zhang to negotiate the Chengdu incident and, incidentally, to raise general Sino-Japanese issues for discussion. Asked whether the ambassador had received instructions regarding the negotiation of the Chengdu incident and whether the content of those instructions could be summarized, he replied that he was unable to disclose the content of the instructions and asked for understanding. Asked whether Secretary Suma had repeatedly visited the Chinese diplomatic authorities before the ambassador's arrival in Nanjing to exchange preliminary views on the Chengdu and Beihai incidents, he replied in the affirmative. Asked whether the so-called general Sino-Japanese issues would begin with economic cooperation, he replied in the affirmative, stating that economic cooperation was the most important key to the adjustment of relations between China and Japan, and he was determined to work for its realization and hoped for everyone's help.

Asked whether the ambassador was prepared to have multiple talks with Foreign Minister Zhang in Nanjing, he replied that the meeting in the afternoon was a courtesy call, and the number of meetings would be determined after meeting with Foreign Minister Zhang. Asked how many days the ambassador planned to stay in Nanjing, he replied that it would also be determined after meeting with Foreign Minister Zhang.

<h3>Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Negotiations Begin</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe Shigeru, who had been staying in Shanghai, entered Nanjing privately the day before yesterday. Yesterday, he had a formal meeting with Foreign Minister Zhang, and began to conduct negotiations. At the same time, Japanese military officers Kita and Sato also followed him to Nanjing, providing advice and discussing countermeasures. Suddenly, the diplomatic building was filled with a tense atmosphere. The long-strained Sino-Japanese situation, after this important negotiation, may have a day of sudden enlightenment. Sino-Japanese people, at this turning point, are all wholeheartedly concentrating, eagerly looking forward to watching the development of the future. We journalists, who are in charge of the people's voice, are deeply concerned, and cannot remain silent. We dare to offer a humble opinion within our limited knowledge.</p>
<p>First, we believe that this Sino-Japanese negotiation should be conducted with sincerity and without any emotional bias from both sides, in order to jointly seek a solution to the entire problem. Regarding the mistakes made in the past, there may be points of disagreement or misunderstanding. It is possible to analyze and resolve or adjust them separately according to their causes. As for the future path of cooperation, the foundation should be laid under the spirit of mutual understanding. In today's world, when the global crisis is imminent, it is necessary for the two major powers of East Asia to adapt to the environment. However, the definition of sincerity should be based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and the explanation of adjustment should be premised on the abandonment of aggression. If one party is resentful and unwilling to let go of past grievances while seeking to restore old relations, while the other party is trying to gain an advantage and constantly seeking new gains, or deliberately dwells on the past and blames the other party for not being sincere, or uses coercive means and calls it adjustment, then that is not what we want to hear, and we sincerely hope that such concerns will not occur in this meeting.</p>
<p>Second, Ambassador Kawagoe's so-called adjustment of national relations is indeed his original mission, and the recent Chengdu and Beihai incidents are also at the core of his negotiations. Regarding this point, we sincerely hope that Ambassador Kawagoe can use his wisdom, his spirit of understanding, and take into account the actual difficulties felt by our authorities, and not make excessive demands. For example, Beihai is currently garrisoned by Weng Zhaoyuan's troops, and the authorities are in the process of persuading them to withdraw. Weng Zhaoyuan's troops are saying that they are defending the territory, and are not yet obeying orders. The authorities themselves are not in a position to replace them suddenly. The Guizhou situation, which has been through many mediations, cannot be allowed to re-ignite any suspicion because of this. The Japanese side should clearly understand this and not put people in an awkward position, and take this as a starting point for showing sincerity. This will surely gain more sympathy from the majority of our people. From there, proceeding with the adjustment of national relations will certainly increase the smooth progress of the negotiations. That can be said with certainty.</p>
<p>There is also one point that we must also add. The Japanese side often says that the Chinese people are anti-Japanese. In fact, looking at the current situation in the country, there is no so-called anti-Japanese sentiment. Above, there is a government that endures humiliation and bears heavy burdens. Below, there are people who are suffering from poverty and want to recover. They are exhausted and distressed. Even the hot-blooded young people, who are full of patriotic thoughts, only care about loving their country, and have absolutely no intention of excluding foreigners. Everyone wants to do good, who is not like me? With the strong patriotic thinking of the Japanese people, how can they forbid others from loving their country? As for the creation of the Sichuan-Guangdong incident, it was truly the act of violent people. It was also due to excessive stimulation, which led the people to take risks to protect the people. Inverting the cause and effect, the responsibility lies with those who created the excessive stimulation. If the Japanese side can truly change its ways in the future and truly work together, then this abnormal emotion can certainly be eliminated invisibly. Otherwise, even with the power of the government, it will be difficult to control the feelings in the hearts of the people. If the Japanese side can know to rely on facts and not use strong words to justify itself, then the future of the negotiations will be bright.</p>

<h3>The Little Entente Conference Just Ended, Italy and Austria in Contact Again, Austrian Foreign Minister Visits Mussolini, Further Reviewing Central European Issues</h3>
<p>(Rome) Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt, this morning, went to Prime Minister Mussolini's villa in Camillia to visit Prime Minister Mussolini. Political figures believe that the communique issued yesterday by the Standing Political Conference of the Little Entente countries in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, severely criticized Austria's abolition of the military clauses of the Treaty of Saint-Germain and the restoration of compulsory military service. Therefore, Mussolini must have advised Schmidt that Austria's relationship with the Little Entente countries must be handled with caution. At the same time, the activities of the National Socialist Party in Austria have recently shown signs of resurgence, and this aspect must also be considered. Officials said that Mussolini and Schmidt only "reviewed the international situation." However, well-informed sources dare not readily believe this. In addition, regarding the Danube River issue, it is recently reported that the Little Entente countries have proposed a solution to Italy, and Italy believes that this requires careful consideration. As for the restoration of the old Habsburg imperial family in Austria, it was already shelved when Germany and Austria concluded an agreement, and it is certain that this will not be mentioned in the talks between Italy and Austria. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>

At a time when the current situation is precarious and unstable, it is truly a pillar of stability." (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt arrived here at 7:15 p.m. today and will hold talks with important Italian political figures tomorrow. It is expected that Prime Minister Mussolini, who is currently recuperating in Camillia, may return to Rome to meet with Schmidt. Tonight, Foreign Minister Ciano will host a banquet in his honor. After getting off the car, Schmidt issued a statement to the press, saying, "I decided to come to Rome according to the usual practice of international exchanges, because it is only natural for the responsible representatives of the Italo-Austrian-Hungarian Protocol signatory countries to visit each other from time to time to strengthen ties. As for Italy and Austria, their friendship is well-known to the world and need not be repeated. What I want to say now is that Austria attaches the greatest importance to this friendship and believes that Italo-Austrian friendship is the primary element for peace and development in Central Europe." (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>

<h3>Hitler Clears the Fields and Prepares for a Decisive Battle with the Reds, The Finale of the National Socialist Party Congress, British Newspapers Call It Affectation</h3>
<p>Nuremberg: The closing ceremony of the 8th National Socialist Party Congress was held today. Leader Hitler issued a warning to Soviet Russia, stating that if Soviet Russia incites a communist movement in Germany similar to that in Spain, Germany will have a decisive battle with it. We must admit that the communist elements outside Soviet Russia are indeed our mortal enemies. Hitler also stated that Germany believes that National Socialism is by no means an export commodity. Germany has its own political system, and other countries are free to choose their own political system. Hitler then sarcastically commented on the disasters in Soviet Russia, saying that the communists should not blame the famine on the climate. Pre-war Russia was abundant in agricultural products and the best in the world, but now it cannot feed its people. The flaws in its system are evident from this. (National Telegraph dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>Nuremberg: 17,000 infantry soldiers, many tanks, and several squadrons of aircraft conducted military exercises today as an embellishment for the closing of the 8th National Socialist Party Congress. German Leader Hitler and other National Socialist Party leaders, as well as diplomatic representatives and military attachés from various countries stationed in Germany, were present to watch. Hitler gave a brief speech to the troops on the spot, saying, "Serious times may be imminent, but we Germans will never retreat or cower." Hitler had given a final speech at the congress that morning, in which he launched an extremely fierce attack on Bolshevism, saying that Bolshevism is currently attempting to advance its troops near the German border. If it applies the methods it has used in Spain to Germany, we must treat it as one of the world's powers and deal with it. We Germans can remain calm, but if Germany feels threatened, the entire nation will rise up and drive out all the troops who think they can defeat Germany beyond the borders of Germany. Hitler also mentioned the Social Democratic Party's attempt to resist Bolshevism, and said that the National Socialist Party has now removed all of the above situations so that it can clear the fields and wage a final battle with Marxism. Hitler also said, "The countries of the world must eventually follow this path, and we dare to believe that no matter what country it is, it must make a decision for tomorrow as soon as possible. If people can respect us, they will find that Germany is the most loyal of their friends, but Bolsheviks must understand that the army of the new Germany has firmly guarded the gates of Germany." After Hitler finished his speech, cheers resounded throughout the venue. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian recently commented on the relations between Germany and Russia, saying, "The mutual verbal battles between the authorities of Germany and Russia are not without affectation. It is true that German Leader Hitler is very dissatisfied with Soviet Russia, but as far as we know here, he is also paying extraordinary attention to the current system in Soviet Russia. Moreover, whenever a real dispute occurs between Germany and Russia, the outside world rarely hears anything about it. Only this time, there was an open debate, so why wouldn't it be intentional? Didn't the Soviet authorities add serious charges against certain German officials on the day the anti-revolutionary case in Moscow opened? The seriousness of this matter was already at its extreme, but the German authorities ignored it, and the Soviet government did not lodge a serious protest with Germany, nor did it reveal the facts of the crime to the world. From this, we can see the extent of the mutual affectation." (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Again Denounces Democracy and Communism, The Jewish People Protest to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Nuremberg: At 8:00 p.m. tonight, German Leader Hitler delivered his final speech at the annual National Socialist Party Congress, launching another fierce attack on democracy and the Soviet Union, saying, "Germany has always adhered to the principle of not offending others unless offended. Therefore, any foreign country does not need to worry too much about Germany's situation. We are not missionaries, and we will never spread our ideals beyond our borders, but we also do not want other countries to interfere in our internal affairs." Hitler then criticized the democratic system, saying, "We Germans have tasted the 'international fraternity' advocated by Western European democratic countries to the full in the fifteen years since the war. We absolutely do not care whether these democratic countries love or hate us. Although the former German democratic government received sympathy from various democratic countries, the German people today dare not accept this kind of sympathy, and it is only natural that these democratic countries will not sympathize with us, and it is also only natural that we should sympathize with authoritative countries. However, we always believe that the democratic system cannot create lasting countries." Hitler then attacked the Soviet Union, saying, "Before the National Socialist Party came to power, the Soviet Union conspired to infect Germany with communism, and we resisted it, so that Moscow could no longer interfere in Germany's affairs. For this reason, we had to recognize Bolshevism as a major enemy... Fortunately, the German people are very sensible. Even if Bolshevist Russia only wanted to lead the thinking of Germany, the Germans would regard it as a great shame. From this point of view, Moscow will always be Moscow, and Germany will always be Germany... A British journalist once asked me if Germany intended to split Europe into two major camps that confronted each other. I replied that this split was already a fact, because the people's front governments of several countries are cooperating with the Bolshevik Party and should be responsible for the split in Europe. These people's front governments probably think that taking a conciliatory attitude towards the Bolshevik Party can guard against the Bolsheviks. In fact, this is due to the indecisiveness of democratic politics. One day, the people of other countries may suddenly awaken and imitate what we have done. In short, what we admire most is Italy, because only Italy knows how to destroy Bolshevism. We also firmly believe that no matter what country in the world, it will eventually have to follow in the footsteps of Germany and Italy, because the purpose of communism is to destroy the whole world... I firmly believe that those who are superstitious about democratic politics will regard me as a 'savage'. In fact, I am better than most Europeans... We should now rise up, follow the instructions of God, and sacrifice everything to wish Germany long life." After the speech, the whole audience cheered, as if possessed. Hitler's voice was slightly hoarse when he spoke, but it did not diminish his enthusiasm. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German Leader Hitler recently gave a speech at the 8th Annual National Socialist Party Congress, announcing a four-year economic plan. According to this plan, all the raw materials needed by Germany will be completely self-sufficient after four years. It is now officially announced that the government will establish an "Academy of Applied Sciences," with the director of the National Highway Bureau, Todt, as its president. Although the specific tasks of the academy have not been announced, it is generally believed that this is the initial work to complete the policy of economic self-sufficiency.

<h3>The French Prime Minister Convenes a Labor-Management Conference to Discuss Ways to Eliminate Labor Unrest</h3>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Léon Blum convened a joint meeting of labor union and employer representatives this afternoon, with the aim of seeking mutual agreement to prevent the occurrence of all future strike waves and to bring a swift end to labor disputes that hinder the general interests of the country. This joint meeting may last for a week. The meeting has also appointed six drafting committee members, including two government representatives, two employer representatives, and two employee representatives, to organize the drafting of an agreement between labor and management. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The strike of 40,000 textile workers in Lille, demanding improved working conditions and increased wages, has been unsuccessful despite the Prime Minister Blum personally mediating. The situation is now becoming increasingly serious. It is reported that the employers' attitude is tough, so there is a possibility of a national general strike. Employers must now choose one of the following two paths: (1) Accept the government's suggestion of arbitration, which would involve signing a collective contract with the workers, stipulating a 40-hour work week and increasing wages; (2) Reject the government's suggestion of arbitration and be willing to have their industry eventually nationalized. They still have 24 hours to decide on their position. At the same time, the government has drafted an order to implement a 40-hour work week for miners, submitting it to the miners and mine owners for final approval. This is the first order on working hours since the government's proposal on June 21 advocated a 40-hour week becoming law. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>The textile strike in Lille has not yet been resolved. Employers have consistently refused the two demands of increasing wages and electing worker representatives. According to a letter from the employers to Prime Minister Léon Blum, "We cannot agree to the workers' demand for a wage increase, because this demand will bankrupt the entire textile industry. Also, the authority of the employer must be maintained within the factory." After a conversation with the chairman of the Textile Industry Association and the chairman of the Lille Chamber of Commerce, Thieriez, and the prefect of the Nord department, Cars, declared, "We refuse to submit to arbitration, and we do not want to sign a collective contract between labor and management, but negotiations have not yet broken down." At 8:30 p.m., Interior Minister Salengro issued a statement to the press, saying, "The government is scheduled to appoint an arbitrator tonight or tomorrow to resolve the Lille labor dispute." This arbitrator will probably be a government cabinet member, but it is still unknown whether the arbitration will take place in Paris or Lille. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Secretariat of the General Confederation of Labor recently held a meeting and passed a resolution to establish a "Support Committee for Striking Textile Workers," requesting workers in local unions to donate one hour's wages each week as living expenses for striking textile workers. The resolution of the conference stated, "Since the employers do not trust the government, the union should express its trust in the government and decided to send an important delegation of union representatives to visit Comrade Léon Blum to express sympathy and solidarity." Finally, the conference also decided to create an "Action Committee" with the freedom to act to resist the rumors and slanders of fascist groups. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>

<h3>Spanish Rebels Intensify Attacks on Madrid, the Capital; Northern Army Advances South Along the Coastline; Rebel Leader Announces Restoration</h3>
<p>Andaye: After the Spanish rebels occupied San Sebastián, their morale has been greatly boosted. They are now preparing to advance south along the coastline with Bilbao as their destination. Residents of that city have already begun to evacuate. The American consul and his family, as well as other European and American expatriates, have departed. At the same time, the military operations of the rebels around Madrid have been intensifying daily. It is claimed that in the last three days, the capital has been bombed five times. The Chilean ambassador to Spain attempted to rescue women and children trapped in the Moorish Alcázar fortress in Toledo, but the rebel commander refused to negotiate directly, and the attempt failed. Although the Alcázar fortress has been repeatedly bombarded and mostly destroyed, the government forces still believe it must be captured before the rebels reach Toledo, otherwise Madrid may be in danger. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Burgos: General Mola, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist Northern Army, delivered a public speech last night, stating, "What we demand is that Spain should hold an important position in Europe. After our victory, we do not want to be isolated internationally, nor do we want other countries to interfere. The only way to maintain national independence is to restore the traditional monarchy. In short, our goal is to build a unified, strong, and Catholic Spain. In addition, we should establish regional autonomy under a unified nation." (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The attempt by the diplomatic corps representatives, Chilean Ambassador to Spain Mugardo and Romanian Commercial Counselor Ilfin, to rescue women and children from the Alcázar fortress yesterday failed because the garrison of the fortress used the excuse of wanting to seek instructions from the revolutionary government. After learning of this, the government forces immediately announced the termination of negotiations. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Toledo: The Chilean ambassador to Spain, Magardo, came here the day before yesterday to mediate between the government forces and the rebels to rescue the women and children besieged in the Alcázar Palace. It is reported that the rebels in the palace have refused. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>San Juan de Luz: Following the intervention of Dr. Junod, a representative of the International Red Cross, the government authorities in San Sebastián have agreed to reopen negotiations on humanizing the civil war. However, the success of this effort depends on the Burgos rebel government agreeing to cooperate. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Madrid: This morning, government forces resumed bombing the Moorish Alcázar fortress. The garrison remained silent and did not return fire. It is reported that the garrison has rejected the mediation of the Chilean ambassador to Spain, Mr. Mourgardo, to rescue the women and children in the fortress. Mr. Mourgardo arrived in Toledo yesterday, intending to request the government forces to cease fire for a period of time so that the 600 women and children in the fortress could leave.

<p>Castel Gandolfo: Pope Pius XI addressed 350 Spanish refugees today, praising the bravery of the Spanish clergy and the efforts of the diplomatic corps to humanize the war. The Pope said that although the goal of the diplomatic corps had not been achieved, their intention was commendable. The Pope mentioned, "The world has been threatened by reactionary propaganda, and the very foundation of the world has been shaken. The civil unrest in Spain has fully demonstrated to Europe and the world the extent to which the foundation of human culture is in danger." His emotions were so deep that he trembled slightly. It is said that when the Pope mentioned that certain people did not hesitate to create a new religion, it was generally understood to be referring to Germany. This important speech by the Pope was broadcast to countries around the world. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>

<p>San Sebastián: General Mola, commander of the rebel Northern Army, today ordered his troops to rest for five days, and then advance west to attack Bilbao. After the retreat of the government forces, they have now built machine gun positions in the vicinity of San Sebastián to await the rebel attack. The government forces' front line extends south from here to Achaibeheia, a strategically important position that is easy to defend and difficult to attack. With just a few machine guns, the rebel advance can be contained. The rebels will likely find future attacks quite difficult. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The fighting on the southeastern front of Talavera is currently advancing and retreating. The loss of this place would open a side of Madrid, allowing the rebels to drive straight in.

After fierce fighting, the government forces advanced six miles. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>

<h3>Locarno Conference Unlikely This Month; Germany and Italy Await Clarification of European Situation</h3>
<p>(London) It is confirmed that the Locarno Conference will not be held before November. German Chargé d'Affaires in Britain Bismarck sincerely stated during a meeting with British Foreign Minister Vansittart today that Germany hopes the conference can achieve good results and therefore needs to make full preparations. Russia was not mentioned in the conversation, but it was said that Germany hopes the conference will be limited to Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Belgium at least at first. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Informed sources believe that a five-nation conference of parties to the Locarno Pact could be convened in London in the third week of October. The British government is currently in contact with Rome and Berlin on this matter. However, the general impression is that both Italy and Germany feel that the date of the meeting is too pressing, and there is not enough time to make full preparations. It is also said that Italy believes that if issues such as the Abyssinian question cannot be definitively resolved and the situation of the Spanish civil war cannot be clarified, then it will be impossible to draft a detailed agenda for the Locarno Conference. As for Germany, it insists that the issues discussed at the Locarno Conference should be limited to matters related to the Rhine region. Britain and France believe that this German position is contradictory to the position Germany put forward at the London Conference in March of this year. At the London Conference, Germany proposed convening a conference of major powers to review Chancellor Hitler's "peace plan," which did include general European issues and was not limited to the Rhine region. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) Various newspapers have recently commented on the upcoming Locarno Conference. Among them, the Evening Standard reported, "Regarding this matter, Italy, on the one hand, wants to reserve room for Germany's eastern neighboring countries to participate in the talks, and on the other hand, firmly stated that if the Soviet Union is allowed to participate, Italy will stay out of it." The Daily Herald reported, "If German Chancellor Hitler's speech yesterday afternoon was a solemn declaration of a carefully considered policy, then the future Locarno Conference will be in vain. In reality, Germany's diplomatic preparations are clearly intended to torpedo the Locarno Conference. If Germany is isolated, it is its own fault, so what is there to complain about?"

<h3>British Ship "The Lily" Suddenly Attacked by Farmers, Killing One Chinese Helmsman; British Consul-General Files Protest</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The British ship "The Lily" was fired upon by farmers yesterday afternoon near Wangping in the West River, killing one Chinese helmsman and injuring the ship's owner, a Briton named Mr. Beyliss, the second engineer, a Belgian named Ramberger, and a Miss Kalette, a teacher of the American Church, who was a passenger. The farmers' actions were reportedly due to the ship's passage causing river water to flood their rice fields. Upon receiving this news, the British authorities dispatched the gunboat "West-Kuala" (625 tons) to the scene to conduct an investigation. Simultaneously, the British Consul-General in Guangzhou, Mr. Philip (who manages British interests in Guangdong and Guangxi, excluding Shantou), has submitted a strongly worded note to the Chinese authorities, requesting the immediate arrest and punishment of the perpetrators according to the law.

<h3>Recent Missing Items from the Palace Museum Found to Be Re-emergence of Old Case</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Heng speaks about the report that the Palace Museum has again experienced the theft of treasures. According to a telegram from the museum in Beiping, the counting of the Western Route Grain Depot on the 14th revealed the absence of seven sub-numbers within a large box. Upon investigation, the treasures within each sub-number were found to have been listed in the missing items list created in March 1928. It is clearly a re-emergence of previous missing items. These items were identified and verified on the spot by the staff of the related departments. The news report is, therefore, erroneous in this matter. The missing items list from 1928 contains over eighty items, and continued counting may reveal more. (Special dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the news report that the Palace Museum discovered the loss of ivory birds, etc., during the inspection of antiques on the 14th, according to a person from the Beijing Office of the Palace Museum, the Beijing Museum reported that seven sub-numbers were missing from box number 228 in the Qianliang Depot yesterday. Upon checking the list of missing items re-investigated in March 1928, totaling more than eighty items, all seven sub-numbers were included. The old record was shown to the temporary supervisors and police, and the true situation was explained to them. The cultural relics stored in the museum are now being recounted and registered under the supervision of personnel dispatched by the central government and local authorities, ensuring meticulous detail to establish credibility. The reported theft situation is, therefore, an old case discovered in 1928. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the discovery of the theft of antiques on the 14th, the Palace Museum issued an official letter on the 15th, stating that the missing items were all recorded in the list of missing items from the reinvestigation of the Qianliang Depot theft case in 1928. However, among the stolen items in the old theft case, some were not included in the list because they had not been reinvestigated, and others had lost their identification tags due to changes in the displayed items. Therefore, there is no accurate statistic on the missing items, and missing items may be discovered at any time during subsequent counting. The counting over the years is a comprehensive inventory. The missing items in the Qianliang Depot, Silver Depot, and Cining Palace were all stolen before 1928, and they should be clearly verified soon. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 15th)</p>

<h3>Cause of Derailment on YueHan Railway</h3>
<p>(Hankou) According to the person in charge of the YueHan Railway Bureau, the derailment of the northbound No. 22 train near Yijiawan, Changsha, was caused by the fact that the highway line runs parallel to the railway line. The highway car drivers were reckless and actually raced with the train. Due to the strong wind generated by the passing train, the car driver accidentally allowed the entire car to be drawn under the water tank car at the rear of the engine. The water tank car jumped up, causing the engine to derail, and three third-class cars overturned in succession. The responsibility lies entirely with the highway bureau's driver's carelessness, which is very clear. If the car had temporarily stopped, it would not have been drawn in by the train. The YueHan train has resumed normal service, and the damaged cars are being repaired at the Xinhe engine factory. Follow-up matters will be handled after Ling Hongxun and Zhou Zhongqi return to the bureau.

<h3>Shantou: The Evil Legacy of the Foreign Sugar Monopoly Remains; Smugglers Can Transport and Sell Sugar Unhindered; Chaozhou Merchants Who Report Taxes and Handle Sugar Are Detained Instead</h3>
<p>Shantou Communication: Guangdong's sugar control and monopoly system has a provincially-run Special Products Monopoly Office in Shantou. All merchants must purchase sugar from the office. Each shop must sell several hundred bags per month. Only designated merchants can sell sugar. Small vendors selling sugar must obtain a license to store and sell sugar. Each market in the 15 counties of Chaozhou and Meizhou is limited to 500 sugar-selling licenses. The system was created by the former Director of Agriculture and Forestry, Feng Rui. This system is the most notorious example of harming farmers and businesses, and officials seizing profits from the people. "Five Rams" brand sugar is actually imported, low-quality goods. Guangdong's Bureau has been updated, the source has been cut off, and there is a shortage of white sugar in Chaozhou and Meizhou. The Guangdong-Hong Kong Sugar Merchants Association and agricultural and industrial groups accused Feng of ten major crimes. Feng was detained by the government and found guilty of corruption. He was executed by the provincial prosecutor on the 9th. However, there is no clear order to abolish the foreign sugar monopoly system created by Feng. It is now the Mid-Autumn Festival, and confectionery shops need white sugar to make goods for the market. It is impossible to find sugar everywhere, and the market price has risen to 26 or 27 yuan per 100 catties. The current market price of Hong Kong Java fine sugar is only 6 yuan 2 jiao per 100 catties. Therefore, smugglers are very active, repackaging foreign sugar into flour bags, each bag containing 50 catties, transporting it to the coastal areas of Hailufeng, turning to the interior of Chaozhou and Meizhou. Another route transports it to Macau, then to various parts of Guangzhou. The quantity is also huge. Chaozhou and Shantou merchants believe that since Shantou is under the control of the central government, all policies should be the same as in other provinces. Recently, they tried to import a batch of foreign sugar, paid taxes at the customs, and passed. Two days ago, the second batch arrived from Hong Kong, but after paying taxes at the customs, they were suddenly detained by the "Shantou Branch of the Provincial Special Products Management Office", accused of smuggling. The merchants argued that they had paid customs taxes, and the Department of Finance had not issued any order prohibiting merchants from importing sugar. Shantou is a commercial port under the central government, so how can it be called smuggling? The Provincial Special Products Branch ignored the merchants' reasons and detained the taxed sugar. The merchants refused to accept the loss and telegraphed various superiors, requesting the return of the original sugar to protect their capital. Since then, Chinese merchants have not dared to import white sugar. The Provincially-run Monopoly Office has no "Five Rams" sugar to sell, while smugglers are still importing large quantities of foreign sugar, mixing them with smuggled goods, and selling them at the current market price of 26 yuan per load in Shantou silver. After paying taxes, each load can still earn more than 5 yuan. Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, there is a huge demand for sugar everywhere, and it has become a business where smugglers monopolize the profits.</p>
<h3>The Fujian Province is Establishing Agricultural Warehouses in Various Counties to Manage the Storage and Mortgage of Agricultural Products and Regulate Rural Finance</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since its establishment in the 24th year of the Republic of China, the Provincial Rural Cooperative Committee has organized over a thousand rural cooperatives in various counties, issuing loans of over 3 million yuan. It has also established rural daily necessities supply and transportation offices, borrowing 300,000 yuan from the Provincial Bank to purchase salt and kerosene, which are then transported to rural cooperatives in various counties for sale at reasonable prices, preventing merchants from exploiting farmers with high prices, greatly benefiting the farmers. Currently, to regulate rural finance, the committee plans to establish agricultural warehouses in the locations of various county district public offices to store and mortgage agricultural products. The committee will work with the three departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction, as well as the Farmers' Provincial Banks, to jointly establish a Provincial Agricultural Warehouse Management Committee. The number of committee members is set at seven. In addition to the ex officio members, namely the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Gao Dengting; the Director of the Finance Department, Si Lie; the Director of the Construction Department, Chen Ticheng; the General Manager of the Provincial Rural Cooperative Committee, Xu Changling; the Manager of the Farmers' Bank, Shen Shuping; and the Manager of the Provincial Bank, Shou Changtian, there will be one additional committee member, who will be appointed by the Provincial Government. The Provincial Government will also designate one person to serve as the Chairman of the committee, presiding over the committee's affairs. A General Manager will be appointed to assist in handling the committee's affairs. The committee will be organized into four sections: General Affairs, Management, Finance, and Auditing, each with a director and three to four staff members and clerks. Each county will establish a County Agricultural Warehouse Management Committee with three to five members. In addition to the ex officio members, namely the County Magistrate, the resident instructor of the Rural Cooperative Committee in the county, and the heads of the offices of the Farmers' Provincial Banks, other members will be appointed by the county government from among the gentry and merchants upon the recommendation of the Provincial Rural Management Committee. The business of the Provincial Management Committee includes: (1) the design, registration, and management of rural warehouses throughout the province; (2) the investigation, supervision, and auditing of agricultural warehouses throughout the province; (3) the planning of funds for agricultural warehouses throughout the province; (4) the issuance and circulation of securities for agricultural warehouses throughout the province; (5) the regulation and supply of food grains throughout the province; and (6) other matters related to agricultural warehouses throughout the province. The business of the County Management Committee includes: (1) receiving agricultural products for storage; (2) receiving commissions from the Farmers' Bank to process, repackage, and sell agricultural products; and (3) other businesses specially approved by the Provincial Government upon submission by the committee. As for the storage and mortgage procedures, it is stipulated that the amount of the mortgage should not exceed 70% of the estimated market price when applying for storage and mortgage of agricultural products. The use of the mortgage funds is limited to the main production activities. The agricultural warehouse will collect the lowest possible interest on the mortgage amount as operating expenses. The rural agricultural product storage and mortgage fund and the agricultural warehouse construction funds have been agreed upon by the Rural Cooperative Committee and the Farmers' Provincial Banks to borrow 4 million yuan. A draft agreement for rural loans was signed on the 12th of this month, with an initial loan of 400,000 yuan as a mortgage fund for agricultural warehouses in Minhou County. It was also decided that for future loans, the Farmers' Bank will target the Rural Cooperative Committee as the borrower, with the Rural Cooperative Committee bearing the debt responsibility. The loan interest rate is set at 8% per month, stipulating: (1) Agricultural warehouses will provide mortgages based on 70% of the actual market price of the stored goods, and the agricultural products mortgaged in each warehouse should be used as collateral; (2) The storage period is limited to a maximum of ten months, from August of each year to May of the following year; (3) Each agricultural warehouse will have a director and a deputy director, who will be recommended and appointed by the Farmers' Bank.

<h3>Smuggling in Chaoshan is Gradually Being Suppressed; Customs' Anti-Smuggling Efforts are Strict, and Smuggled Goods are Gradually Decreasing; Smuggling Groups Disband; Chinese Merchants Refuse to Purchase Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: When Chen Jitang was in Guangdong the year before last, he heavily levied "miscellaneous taxes on imported agricultural products," formed his own land and water anti-smuggling teams, set up inspection and verification factories, and competed with the customs for priority in inspecting ships. Tax police and customs soldiers repeatedly caused misunderstandings and conflicts. From the customs to the Jardine Matheson wharf, they were both armed and on guard, almost forming a confrontational situation. This action not only became an international laughingstock but also provided smugglers with an excellent opportunity for smuggling. Central anti-smuggling ships could not be increased to strengthen anti-smuggling forces along the Chaoshan coast, fearing that minor incidents would lead to misunderstandings. Thus, the smuggling ships of Japanese ronin were able to roam freely in the waters of Nanao, Chenghai, and Raoping. They smuggled in goods subject to heavy taxes, such as foreign opium, self-refining products, alcohol, matches, Western medicine, silk cloth, and seafood, and simultaneously used armed escorts to export silver, tungsten ore, and other items. Rice was even unloaded in front of the customs, stored in warehouses, and transported to various counties for sale. The Guangdong land and water anti-smuggling soldiers dared not intervene. Sometimes, smuggled rice and beans intercepted in the inland rivers of Jieyang and Chaoan were also snatched away by armed ronin. The Guangdong authorities could do nothing. Fortunately, the Guangdong situation has now been renewed. The special tax on foreign rice collected by the Agricultural Products Bureau has been returned to the customs for collection. The land and water anti-smuggling Lanka Chen soldiers also voluntarily withdrew and disbanded on July 20th. The customs' anti-smuggling power was thus restored. Last month, the central anti-smuggling ship sailed to Nanao. The captain met with County Magistrate Lin Zhijian to inquire about the smugglers' smuggling and hiding of goods in detail and was trying to intercept them. Unexpectedly, the smuggling cargo ships were equipped with wireless telegraphs and were well-informed. Moreover, the engine power of these ships was very fast. Upon receiving information, they sailed to the Dongshan area, so it was impossible to capture them. Currently, Guangzhou has specially dispatched the Haiying, Haiwei, and Haiwu anti-smuggling ships to Shantou to serve. The salt police have increased by one company, totaling one battalion including the original one. The customs has added forty white-hat inspectors and one company of customs soldiers. The strength of the anti-smuggling force is stronger than before. The new anti-smuggling reward measures issued by the Ministry of Finance to Shantou stipulate that in addition to confiscating the smuggled goods, a fine and proceeds from the auction of the goods will be awarded to the informant at a rate of 50%. Many people are willing to act as informants. Customs officials have noticed that many goods sold in the market have not been reported to customs for inspection and verification but are flooding the market. For example, no one has declared taxes on foreign ginseng in the past three years, but the market is still flooded with it, with a continuous supply and very low prices. The same is true for fabrics and silk cloth. The customs had already received reports from informants and searched a foreign firm on Chaoan Street a few months ago. After being refused entry upstairs by ronin, they focused on Chinese merchant stores. A large amount of untaxed silk cloth was seized in various silk cloth shops in the city the day before yesterday. Even the stores' incoming and outgoing goods ledgers were taken away by the customs to thoroughly investigate the source. If there is no tax payment receipt proving the origin, date, and ship name of the goods, they will all be punished as smuggled goods. The investigation is currently underway. The Silk Cloth Trade Association, considering the strict laws and regulations of the authorities, specially resolved last night that all members of the industry should no longer sell smuggled goods. If this happens again, they will report it internally. Other trade associations are also willing to assist the government in anti-smuggling. According to investigations, the customs' seized smuggled goods are publicly auctioned once every Thursday. Previously, each auction would bring in more than 6,000 to 11,000 yuan (large batches are not included). In the past three or four weeks, this has been reduced by two-thirds, with each auction only selling for more than 1,000 yuan. This shows the decline of the smugglers' power. Smuggling groups have seen that the anti-smuggling power has been unified and that things are different from the past. Starting last month, they have stopped importing rice. The Tonghe Company, which handled rice in Hong Kong, was the first to close, and the combination company also closed last month.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province is Actively Building Highways to Complete the Provincial Highway Network</h3>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: The main and branch lines of the highways in southern Anhui have been largely completed, and all are equipped with bridges, culverts, and road surfaces. However, although the roadbeds of the roads in northern Anhui are roughly in place, the lack of stone materials means that most road surfaces have not been paved. The Construction Department has recently been rushing to repair roads, mostly in southern Anhui. This should be shifted to northern Anhui to achieve balanced development. The various roads that have already been started and the roads that are being added will all be completed as soon as possible. It is also planned to expand and renovate the roads that are already open to traffic, and to urge the counties to rush to build the county roads that need to be repaired, with the hope of completing the entire provincial highway network. The various roads that need to be repaired and built are described below: (1) The Jiangyu Road, from Jiangba in Mingguang, through Fuchang, to Yujiawa on the border of Jiangsu and Anhui, is 98 kilometers long in Anhui Province. The earthwork has been rushed to build in sections, and the bridge and culvert designs have started. All unfinished projects on the entire road should be completed by the end of this year. (2) The Chuliu Road, from Chuxian through Caishiying on the border of Jiangsu and Anhui to Liuhe in Jiangsu Province, is 25 kilometers long in Anhui Province. The roadbed earthwork has been completed, and the bridges and culverts have also started. All unfinished projects should be rushed to complete by the end of this year. (3) The Jiangming Road, from Jiangba in Mingguang, through the county seat of Mingguang to Mingguang, is 98 kilometers long. The roadbed earthwork has started to be rushed, and the bridges and culverts are being designed. All unfinished projects should be completed by the 25th year of the Republic of China. (4) The Quanpu Road, from Quanjiao to Jiangpu in Jiangsu Province, is 17.5 kilometers long in Anhui Province. The roadbed earthwork is largely completed, and the bridges and culverts are being rushed to repair. The unfinished projects should be completed by the end of this year. (5) The Hewu Road, from Hexian through Baidu Bridge to Yuxi on the opposite bank of Wuhu, is 30.5 kilometers long, connecting to the Xiliang branch line for 6 kilometers. The roadbed earthwork has been completed, and the bridges and culverts are being planned. The unfinished projects are planned to be completed by the 25th year of the Republic of China. (6) The Shenyin Road, from the ferry crossing on the opposite bank of the provincial capital to Yinjiahui, is 33 kilometers long. The formal bridges and culverts were completed long ago. Because the roadbed still needs to be raised, it is being rushed to repair. The road surface project is planned to be continued and completed in the 25th year of the Republic of China. (7) The Yintun Road, the section from Yinjiahui to Guichi, is 24 kilometers long. The roadbed and bridges and culverts were completed long ago. Because the roadbed is newly completed, the road surface has not been paved. It is planned to pave the road surface after the Shenyin Road roadbed is raised. (8) The Anjing Road, from the ferry crossing on the opposite bank of Anqing, through Dongliu, to Shimenya on the border of Jiangxi and Anhui, is 123 kilometers long. The roadbed bridges and culverts were completed long ago, but the road surface has not been paved. It is planned to continue to rush to complete it. (9) The Shuliu Road, from Shucheng to Liuan, its construction route, connects to the Anhe Road Taolin line to the Thirty Li Pu in Liuan, connecting to the Heliu Road line. The roadbed and simple bridges were completed long ago, and the formal bridges and culverts have been completed. From Taolin to the county seat of Liuan, it is 63 kilometers long, and the road surface is being constructed, and should be completed within this year. (10) The Chufeng Road, from Chuxian through Hongxinpu to Fengyang, is about 110 kilometers long. Recently, the county has decorated the earthwork to complete. The formal investigation of the bridges and culverts is occupied. After the investigation and reporting are approved, construction will start immediately. The unfinished projects are planned to be completed ahead of schedule within this year. (September 11th)</p>

<h3>Suzhou Robbery Cases Occur Frequently</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been an abundance of bandits and robbery cases in Suzhou. In addition to the four villages robbed in Weiting as reported yesterday, Lianmu Xiaxu Village and others have also experienced robberies and injuries. The incident occurred the night before yesterday. More than 20 bandits arrived by boat at Xiaxu Village, landed, and immediately fired shots to demonstrate their power. Under the command of one bandit, they divided into four groups and stormed into the homes of Village Chief Jin Yaoquan and villagers Hu Rongfu, Tian Shuanggen, and Tian Shuanghu, looting extensively. It is estimated that Jin's family lost clothing and other items worth over 200 yuan, and the losses of the other three families were also significant. After looting, the bandits boarded their boat and sailed to Guxiang圩 in the jurisdiction of Wucongjing.

<h3>Boat Collision Causes Tragedy</h3>
<p>Xu Asi, the owner of a ferry boat near the Shuixian Temple outside the South Gate, had three passengers, Yin Meirong, Yin Asan, and Zhou Hejin, at around 7:00 PM the day before yesterday. They were crossing the river from Shangtang to Xiatang. As they were approaching the shore, they were violently struck by Zhu A'er and Zhu San'da's sugar boat and Song A'wu's Ningbo opera troupe boat. The passengers Yin Meirong and Yin Asan lost their footing and fell into the river. Yin Meirong was rescued, but Yin Asan tragically drowned. After the court appointed a prosecutor to conduct an examination, it was confirmed that he had fallen into the river and died. Song Awu, Jin Sijiu, and Zhu Sanda were all brought to the court for questioning. However, Zhu Sanda's brother, Zhu A'er, who was on the boat, suffered an acute stomach ailment. Upon suddenly seeing his brother cause such a disaster, he suffered a great shock, which led to his death. Yesterday, his elder brother, Zhu Arong, reported the death to the court for examination. Prosecutor Shen, along with officials, went to the countryside to conduct an examination, confirming that he had died of illness. The family members were ordered to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>

<h3>Haimen Three Factory Town Arrests Four Suspects</h3>
<p>The Three Factory Town Public Security Substation arrested four suspects of being traitors, Guo Kaisen, Guo Zhigen, Liang Zhenxian, and Shen Yitao, the day before yesterday and sent them to the county for interrogation. The county government held a court session yesterday (11th). According to Guo Kaisen's confession, he is 36 years old, from Wuhu County, Anhui Province. Since April in the lunar calendar, he purchased 5,000 packets of Rindan from the Taihe Pharmacy in Nantong and sold them in Haimen. Guo Zhigen is my nephew. Liang Zhenxian confessed that he is from Hefei and brought a map to consult because he was not familiar with the area. Finally, Shen Yitao confessed that he was hired by Guo to carry the burdens. Chen, the presiding judge, repeatedly questioned them, and they all absolutely denied any actions as traitors. However, because this case involves suspicion of treason, the suspects will be sent to the Nantong Commissioner's Office for trial today (12th).</p>
<h3>Jiaxing Apprentice Bites Director</h3>
<p>The Jiaxing Civilian Arts and Crafts Training Center is divided into civilian and vagrant sections. The training period for the vagrant section is mostly six months, and they can leave after the term expires. The director, Huang Tongsheng, believing that the center's operating expenses are limited, has been engaged in production to supplement the funds. Recently, he has added printing and button-making work. However, the working hours for the apprentices are over ten hours per day. Those who work hard after the expiration of the term are often deemed to have poor conduct and are subject to extension of their terms, which is not uncommon. As a result, the apprentices have accumulated deep resentment. On the morning of the 14th, apprentices Zheng Zirong, Wu Jinlan, Tao Ergong, Yu Yonggao, Tao Shaoguan, etc., surrounded Director Huang during the weekly memorial service and bit his back and left and right arms, causing numerous wounds. Guard Chen Rongqing was also struck in the head by the apprentices. The security team and police brigade arrived at the scene and arrested Zheng Zirong and the other four, who were detained by the Public Security Bureau for processing.</p>
<h3>Bengbu Huai River Small Steamer Robbed</h3>
<p>The Changhuai small steamers usually travel upstream. Only the Huashun and Futai small steamers travel downstream, between Wuhe and Linhuai, a journey of about 90 li. They depart in opposite directions once a day. The water surface is calm, and there are no bandits. Unexpectedly, a robbery of a small steamer occurred recently, which was unexpected. At 7:00 PM on the 12th, the Huashun small steamer, traveling from Wuhe to Linhuai, arrived at the Yama Temple, 12 li from Linhuai. Suddenly, more than 20 bandits who had been lying in ambush on the boat pulled out their pistols and forced the driver to stop. They then began to search the passengers, overturning boxes and chests. For about four hours, the passengers dared not speak up and let them loot everything. At 10:00 PM, the bandits landed and left. On the morning of the 13th, the Linhuai water police station heard the news and sent four boats to pick up the passengers and bring them to Linhuai. According to the victims, the Huashun was robbed, and the passengers' property losses were estimated at 4,000-5,000 yuan. However, no one was injured or kidnapped, which was a stroke of good luck in the misfortune.</p>

<h3>Inspection Issues at Concessions Factories: The Consular Body's Opinions Have No Legal or Factual Basis; Secretary-General Yu Replies to the Shanghai Municipal Council, Hoping They Will Forward It to the Consular Body for Reconsideration</h3>
<p>The issue of factory inspections in the Shanghai concessions has been discussed several times by Secretary-General Yu of the Shanghai Municipal Government and the concession authorities. A draft of nine articles was finally agreed upon in June of this year. It was approved by the Municipal Council board, which believed that factory inspections in the concessions would soon be implemented. Laborers were delighted. However, the Italian-led Consular Body in Shanghai expressed dissent and requested revisions, resulting in a de facto suspension of the draft agreement. It is now heard that the Municipal Government believes the Consular Body's opinions have no legal or factual basis. Secretary-General Yu has sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council, hoping they will forward it to the Consular Body for reconsideration so that the original draft agreement can be resolved as soon as possible to ensure the safety of laborers. The original letter is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Regarding the case of factory inspections in the Special District, I received your president's letter of July 13, enclosing a letter from the senior consul to your bureau chairman, requesting review and reply. Upon review, the Consular Body's opinion is that the factory inspection agreement is "tantamount to partially abolishing the treaty privileges of countries enjoying consular jurisdiction." They advocate amending the draft to clearly stipulate that Chinese factory laws can only be applied to factories within the concession that are under Chinese legal jurisdiction. The enjoyment of consular jurisdiction by nationals of treaty countries cannot restrict the exercise of China's administrative power. The factory law is an administrative regulation, and the implementation of factory inspections is an exercise of China's national administrative power. Judging by legal principles and treaties, even those enjoying consular jurisdiction have no reason to protest. Furthermore, in fact, foreign-owned factories have often handled labor disputes in accordance with China's Labor Dispute Resolution Law. This is a precedent for foreigners applying Chinese law. Therefore, regarding the point of consular jurisdiction, the misunderstanding is already very obvious. As for the statement in the final paragraph of the original letter, "Alternative inspection methods can be established based on the powers granted by the Yangjingbang Regulations," regarding the essence of those regulations, the provisions for the existing administrative powers of the Municipal Council are all enumerated, not generalized, and cannot be arbitrarily expanded. Therefore, this government believes that the Consular Body's opinions have no legal or factual basis. Furthermore, I, the Secretary-General, was previously ordered to agree on a draft with your president, which took into account both legal principles and facts, and the positions of both parties have been carefully considered. The seventh article of the draft provides considerable remedies for the concerns of the Consular Body. This is what I, the Secretary-General, should urge you to pay attention to. I am replying accordingly, hoping you will review it and promptly forward it to the Consular Body for reconsideration so that the draft agreement can be resolved as soon as possible to ensure the safety of laborers. I also hope to receive a reply. Addressed to: President Fessenden of the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>The Songhu Garrison Command Announces Temporary Partial Martial Law in the City from the 17th to the 20th of This Month</h3>
<p>Since the Chengdu-Beihai incident occurred in this city, party, government, and military authorities have been making every effort to maintain public order, and it has not been affected in any way. However, reactionary elements hiding in this city are secretly active, sparing no effort. As the anniversary of the September 18th Incident approaches, it is heard that they will take advantage of the commemorative events held by various groups in the city, infiltrate those groups, and carry out large-scale disturbances. Yang, the commander of the Songhu Garrison Command, in order to maintain public order, consulted with Mayor Wu and submitted a request to the central government, which approved the declaration of temporary partial martial law in the city from the 17th to the 20th of this month.

<h3>Baoshan Seawall Protection Committee Telegrams the Provincial Government Requesting Appropriation for Repair; A Line of Remaining Dikes Nearly Collapsed; Terrible Winds and Giant Waves Create Dangerous Situations</h3>
<p>A telegram from the Baoshan Seawall Protection Committee reads: Chairman Chen of the Zhenjiang Provincial Government, Director Shen of the Construction Department, Magistrate Zhang of this county, and all respected sirs: This month, a hurricane passed through, and the tide was high. The Baoshan seawall, a line of remaining dikes, nearly collapsed. Fortunately, the wind direction changed, and a major disaster was averted. However, the outer wing walls of Beishidong were completely destroyed, and the concrete wall of Beiwang Temple, 340 zhang long, has a hollow bottom and is leaning outward. Furthermore, the 42 zhang slope of the Chuchengjing section, which was repaired in the 22nd year, is almost completely gone. Previously, there were rows of piles to protect the outside of the dike, but they have not been repaired for many years, so the slope and the base of the dike are easily damaged. Other sections also have sunken surfaces and numerous cracks. Now, it is the season of autumn floods and high tides. If there are more terrible winds and giant waves, the situation will become unmanageable. People are panicked. Considering that the seawall project is of great importance, if there is any negligence, not only will the lives and homes of the people along the dike be lost, but also the land taxes of Jiangsu and Songjiang and the prosperity of Shanghai will lose their guarantee. We earnestly request that you quickly dispatch personnel to inspect and allocate funds for construction as soon as possible to eliminate the major disaster and bring lasting peace. We await your urgent orders. Zhang Jia'ao, chairman of the Baoshan County Seawall Protection Committee, Tao Qingfeng, vice-chairman, Gu Hongru, chairman of the Water Conservancy Committee, Bao Siren, director of the Public Funds and Properties Management Office, Wang Cheng, vice-director, Xu Liangxi, Lu Fengpu, Gu Xi, Wang Qingtao, Shen Buyin, and other district chiefs respectfully submit this document.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Abolished the Night Navigation Import Ban; Shanghai Shipping Companies Celebrate the Notification</h3>
<p>Merchant ships sailing from Shanghai to Guangdong, regardless of Chinese or foreign nationality, have not been allowed to enter Guangzhou at night since the 12th year of the Republic of China. They could only stay outside the port and be allowed to enter the port after inspection the next morning. During Chen Jitang's administration, the ban was strictly enforced, causing unbearable suffering to shipping companies. Regularly scheduled ships that needed to meet deadlines were often delayed due to the delayed entry into the port, causing them to miss their schedules. British companies such as Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire have repeatedly negotiated with Chen Jitang</p>
<p>Striving hard, but they were unable to abolish this restriction. Therefore, for the past 13 years, merchant ships have not been allowed to enter the port at night, from sunset to sunrise, in Guangzhou. Since the central government unified the two Guangdong provinces and Chen Jitang fled, everything has been taken over by the central government. Wu Shude, the director of the Seaport Quarantine Office, personally went to Guangdong to take over the seaport quarantine affairs and fundamentally eliminated all the previous harsh restrictions, aiming to align them with the methods of seaports throughout the country. All bans on merchant ships</p>
<p>Night Navigation Import</p>
<p>were also deemed unreasonable and only caused hardship for shipping companies. Wu decided to abolish this ban on September 6th. Except for ships from epidemic ports, which must comply with quarantine regulations and not enter the port at night when arriving in Guangdong, but stay outside the port and wait for medical inspection, any Chinese or foreign merchant ships from any port can freely enter when arriving in Guangdong, no matter what time of night. The Guangdong Customs and the Seaport Quarantine Office have jointly announced this, and the official notification to Shanghai shipping companies was received yesterday. All Chinese and foreign shipping companies in this port were overjoyed upon hearing the news. From now on, ships traveling to and from Guangdong will not only save time for passengers and cargo, but also regular scheduled ships will be able to avoid past delays and missed schedules, saving a great deal on fuel and supplies. This is even more important now that the South China shipping industry is developing rapidly. There are 22 to 24 scheduled ships sailing from Shanghai to Guangdong, and many more unscheduled ships. Shipping companies have already notified all shipowners to take note.</p>

<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that the RMB 120 million Guangdong Financial Consolidation Public Bond of the 25th year of the Republic of China will be issued on October 1st.

The denominations are divided into four types: RMB 10, RMB 100, RMB 1,000, and RMB 10,000. Now, Special Envoy Song plans to mortgage a small portion of the financial consolidation public bonds to the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the China Bank to obtain cash as a means of consolidating Guangdong Province's finances. It has been decided to negotiate and sign a contract for the mortgage loan after the new public bonds are issued.</p>
<p>Previous Loan Directly Disbursed</p>
<p>At the end of July, Special Envoy Song borrowed RMB 6 million from the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications to consolidate Guangdong Province's finances, using the province's tax revenue as collateral. After the contract was signed, the loan was disbursed in four installments, each RMB 1.5 million. The fourth installment was fully disbursed yesterday by the Guangzhou branches of the three banks. He has also borrowed RMB 2 million from eight banks, including the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Zhongnan Bank, the Jincheng Bank, the Salt Bank, the Guohua Bank, the Dongya Bank, and the Guohuo Bank, using the province's tobacco and alcohol stamp tax as collateral. The contract was signed yesterday in Guangzhou, with a term of one year and an interest rate of 7.5%. The funds will be directly disbursed by the Guangzhou branches of each bank.</p>

<p>A dispatch from the Central News Agency in Tianjin states that Wang Kemin, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee's Economic Committee, has firmly resigned and will be succeeded by Li Sihao, the former Minister of Finance, currently in Shanghai. A reporter from the Central News Agency made inquiries at the Li residence on Yuyuan Road yesterday morning. Li was out on business, but according to his family, Li has been living in Shanghai and managing financial businesses since leaving office and has long since given up any intention of pursuing an official career. The rumors are likely untrue. Sources have also learned that Song Zheyuan has indeed intended to have Li succeed Wang Kemin due to Wang's firm resignation, but whether Li will go north is still difficult to predict. Li is currently 57 years old and a native of Cixi, Zhejiang. He was a Jinshi in the Gui Mao year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. He has successively served as a secretary in the Ministry of Finance, an official in the Salt Affairs Administration, a director, a financial director, a Minister of Finance, a Director-General of the Salt Affairs Administration, and a Director-General of the Currency System Bureau.</p>

<h3>Refusal to Issue Licenses for the Shipment of Stored Goods in Tianjin; Executive Yuan's Instructions</h3>
<p>Already Submitted to the Ministry of Finance for Verification</p>
<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk and Satin Weaving Joint Association previously telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry to reject the reported petition of the Tianjin dyeing and weaving industry to Beijing, requesting permission to issue licenses for the shipment of all stored goods, in order to maintain industry and commerce.

<h3>US Expert Report: Status of Tung Tree Planting in Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>Existing Tung Tree Forests Cover 7,500 Acres, Capable of Producing 5,000 Tons of Tung Oil After Six Years</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Chinese vegetable oil factories are actively underway, with detailed investigations into the tung oil production of various countries for reference. Regarding the status of tung tree planting in Soviet Russia, this is based on a report by a US Department of Commerce expert. The climate in areas such as Georgia, south of the Caucasus Mountains, is mild and suitable for tung tree planting. In order to pursue development, the authorities are paying close attention to the promotion of tung forests. The Soviet government is making every effort to promote domestic tung oil production. Several years ago, a "Tung Oil Bureau" was established in Batumi on the Black Sea to actively carry out this initiative, striving to ensure that the domestic paint industry and other industries requiring tung oil do not have to rely on foreign oil supplies. Tung tree planting in Soviet Russia began 30 years ago, initially only as trial planting in the Batumi Botanical Garden. After the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan in 1930, the national paint industry rose up in demand, and the government paid attention to the tung tree planting industry. In 1934, the area of tung tree planting in Soviet Russia was only 1,000 acres. In 1935, it was expanded to 2,500 acres. Currently, tung forests cover 7,500 acres. It is expected that in two years, tung forests near Georgia will reach 25,000 acres. The current quantity of tung oil produced in Soviet Russia is still limited, but according to chemical analysis, its quality is quite good. The Soviet authorities hope that when the third Five-Year Plan is implemented, tung oil production will increase daily. It is expected that by 1942, production will increase to 5,000 tons per year, enough to meet the needs of Soviet Russia's domestic industry.</p>
<h3>American Fisheries Expert Dr. Herre Arrives in Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Communications Order: Revocation of Yu Da License</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau received an instruction from the Ministry of Communications stating: "Approved by the Ministry of Finance Guan Zi No. 2875, the Longkou Sub-Customs detained the Yu Da steamer due to a case. The ship secretly sailed away. Please revoke the original license issued to the ship and do not issue a new license. Please reply, etc." Approved. In addition to replying to the Ministry of Finance and ordering the Tianjin Maritime Affairs Bureau and the Fuzhou and Xiamen offices, the original consultation and attachments are copied and issued, ordering the bureau to comply with the public announcement of the original license No. 357 issued to the Yu Da steamer as invalid. At the same time, pay attention to the ship's attempts to apply for a new license. Also instruct all subordinates to comply with this order.</p>
<h3>National Match Company: Postponed Opening</h3>
<p>Due to Inadequate Preparations in Tianjin and Qingdao</p>
<p>The China National Match Production and Sales Joint Company, jointly formed by match manufacturers nationwide, along with the Tianjin and Qingdao branches, was originally scheduled to open for business simultaneously today (the 16th). Yesterday, Mr. Xu Zhiy said to the reporter of the Ta Kung Pao that the Joint Company must open at the same time. Now, the head office has received telegrams from Tianjin and Qingdao stating that various procedures have not been completed and they cannot open as scheduled today. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the date of the postponed opening for business.</p>
<h3>French Concession Taxpayers Association: Seventh Executive Committee Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association held its seventh Executive Committee meeting at the association's office yesterday at 3 PM. The committee members present were Du Yuesheng (Shang Mujiang as his representative), Shang Mujiang, Zhang Xiangyun, Huang Xianggu, Wang Deyan, Du Gang, Cai Hongtian, Zhou Qinpu (Li Weiliang as his representative), Li Weiliang, Wu Xiu (Du Gang as his representative), Wang Shunfa, Dong Kechang (Zhu Shengmao as his representative), Bei Zairong, Gu Wensheng, Gong Jingyan, Dai Chunfeng, Qu Zhenhua, Mao Yun, and over thirty others. Du Yuesheng (Shang Mujiang as his representative) was publicly elected as chairman, Zhang Shishi as the recorder. After the formalities, the chairman reported, and then the discussion began. (1) A letter from the Bai'er Road Bao Xiang Tobacco Exchange stated that the French concession water and electricity company forced compensation for the water meter glass without success, and resorted to the means of cutting off the water supply as a threat. A resolution was requested. It was resolved to send a letter to the Municipal Council stating that in the event of such incidents, users should be notified in advance before handling. (2) A request to the French Concession authorities for subsidies for Chinese children's education expenses was previously raised at the current delegates' congress, but has not yet been implemented. The association should first investigate the school district situation within the concession and then reiterate the previous motion. It was resolved to send a letter to the Second District Education Association to request a detailed report on the number of students in the district and the distribution of municipal and private schools for verification. (3) The French Concession Police Department refuses to take responsibility for illegal activities of private detectives. How should this be corrected? An example is the suicide case on Ximen Road, which was committed by Hu Fusheng, a private detective of the French Concession police station. After the incident, the police station immediately dismissed Hu Fusheng to shirk responsibility. It was resolved to send a letter to the Police Department requesting that Hu Fusheng, the offender in the example, be responsible for arresting the case and transferring it to the court for investigation. In the future, in the event of similar incidents, the police station shall not arbitrarily release the offending employees. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>China United Company: To Be Established Soon</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the financial and industrial circles in this city believe that the national goods industry has developed rapidly in recent years, with excellent products. In order to promote sales, they plan to organize a China United Company to manage everything. The reporter visited Mr. Lin Kanghou, the person in charge of preparing the company, yesterday.

The registered capital is 100,000 yuan, which has been largely determined and is being registered. It is expected that it will be established soon. The richest place in the world today is Africa. Therefore, after the company is established, it will target Africa as its business destination. A batch of samples has been shipped there and has been well received. The most needed items in that area are Chinese tea and embroidery. In the future, domestic and Nanyang areas will not be within the scope of business, in order to widely promote the sale of national goods.</p>

<p>According to Da Kung Pao, over 700 ticket conductors of the English Shanghai Tram Company in the Public Concession were recently dissatisfied because ticket inspectors No. 25 and No. 4 falsely reported ticket conductor Wang Jintang to the writing room on the 3rd of this month, intending to dismiss the ticket conductor.

<h3>Prices of Miscellaneous Grains: Trending Towards Stability</h3>
<p>Government and Merchants Emphasize Controlled Transportation and Sales</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, foreign merchants previously purchased large quantities of grain in the Yangtze River area, causing anxiety in the grain market. According to inquiries from reporters to grain merchants, foreign merchants have temporarily stopped buying in the Yangtze River area. The output of miscellaneous grains in various places this year is more abundant than in previous years. Therefore, the recent prices of miscellaneous grains are trending towards stability. However, because the late rice crop is about to be harvested, it is expected that if there are no special changes in the weather this year, the late rice harvest will be bountiful. There are concerns that cheap sales will harm farmers. Therefore, government and merchants are paying close attention to controlled transportation and sales. After the Guangdong and Guangxi incident was resolved, the supply of Siamese rice, which was originally needed annually in that area, was affected. Recently, after the Guangdong Customs imposed import duties on foreign rice, the import of foreign rice has become less cost-effective than domestic rice. Therefore, domestic rice has a lively atmosphere in Guangdong Province.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association: Banquet for Tang Hai'an Last Night</h3>

<h3>Promotion of Tuberculosis Prevention Work: Weekly X-Ray Checkups; Convenient for Academic and Professional Circles; Location at No. 2 Da Xi Road</h3>
<p>The Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association and Hongqiao Sanatorium held group X-ray checkups for tuberculosis prevention last month. One location was at the First Clinic in Nanshi and the other was at the Hongqiao Sanatorium Branch on Da Xi Road. Because it concerns early diagnosis and public health, people from all walks of life participated enthusiastically, which shows that people in society have paid attention to preventive medicine. This is the dawn for the future of national health care. Hospitals in this city, such as Hu Tai Tongde, have also followed suit. The Education Bureau has also issued a notice to all schools that all faculty and students should use X-rays to check their lung health every year in order to engage in early prevention, which is an urgent need. In order to promote tuberculosis prevention and facilitate the academic and student communities or professional circles, weekly X-ray checkups will be held every Saturday morning at the Hongqiao Branch on Da Xi Road starting this week. Dr. Gu Honglie, an expert in X-ray diagnosis and treatment, is hired as the director. The fee is still one yuan. Purchase inspection certificates from the Shen Bao Newspaper Office in this port in advance. There are specific times to avoid crowding. There are a total of 230,000 students in this city and 20,000 faculty members. Even with the concerted efforts of the above hospitals, it is impossible to complete all the checkups. Therefore, according to the opinion of the Anti-Tuberculosis Association, if hospitals hold group checkups, they must be directed by specialized physicians and there must be a unified cooperation method. The inspection machinery should preferably have shockproof equipment and new safety devices like the Hongqiao Branch to avoid accidents.</p>

<h3>The Kidnapping of Xu Wenliang: The Bandits Planned Meticulously; Met for a Long Time and Drew a Round Sample; Continued Trial Yesterday in the District Court; Two Other Bandits Committed Theft in the Concession</h3>
<p>Xu Wenliang, a Cantonese and manager of the Meifu Petroleum Company, lived at No. 1305 Yuyuan Road. On the morning of July 14th of this year, seven bandits suddenly broke into his house with weapons, robbing him of French currency, diamond rings, and other valuables worth more than 400 yuan. Before leaving, they also kidnapped Xu Wenliang and hid him in a cow shed at No. 1 Yangjia Lane, Nanxiang, planning to send a letter demanding a huge ransom. When Detective Feng Baishun, Detective Wang Yongjun, Wang Chang, Sun Wenxi, Chen Yaoting, and Detective Kong Guangxiao, etc. of the Chengdu Road Police Station found out, they successively arrested the bandits involved in the case, Cao Chunbao, Lu Laisheng, Zhang Heshang, Zhang Guiqing, Zhang Xu's wife, Yang Chunshan, Lu A'gen, Tang Heming, Shen Tingyan, Du Haisheng (namely Shaoxing A'da), Chen Zhihong (namely Headless Ghost A'liu), etc., a total of eleven people, and</p>
<p>Rescued the Hostage</p>
<p>Xu Wenliang, escorted them to the First Special Court for interrogation and custody. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Now it is known that during the rescheduling, the detectives handling the case found that the defendant Yang Chunshan had held weapons and formed a gang to rob Shu Hongdong's house at No. 41, Lane 807, Diswei Road, for valuables worth 239 yuan in foreign currency on July 13th of this year. The defendant Chen Zhihong also provided military equipment to the thief Ma Mugui and others to carry out scavenging activities. The detectives then hung out a part of the original stolen goods robbed from the Shu family at the Lao Qinglong Silver Shop on North Zhejiang Road and the Xincheng Jewelry Store on Hankou Road. Yesterday afternoon, the police station escorted the above eleven people, Cao Chunbao and others, to the Criminal Court No. 8 of the First Special Court. Judge Tan Xinzhen was promoted to continue the trial. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case, saying that the defendants had all</p>
<p>Recorded Confessions</p>
<p>It was found that there were two gangs of kidnappers in this case, one led by Wang Jinsheng and the other directed by Shen A'gen. Before the kidnapping, because they did not know the gate of Xu Wenliang's house, Shen A'gen drew a picture to indicate how to enter and exit. In addition to Wang and Shen being at large, there are still major accomplices Chen Anzu (namely Wei Rong, also known as Old Cheng Rotten Foot A'mao) and Long-legged Old Xu, etc. Several people have not been arrested. When asked, Cao Chunbao confessed that I was originally a line of a detective, and this decided to find out the traces of the kidnappers and report them to the detective. Unexpectedly, on July 14th, I met Du Haisheng (namely Shaoxing A'da) on the road, who invited me to the third house in the third lane of Tianbao Li, Zhabei. As soon as I entered the door, I opened the meeting and was inside.</p>
<p>Discussing the Kidnapping</p>
<p>Xu Wenliang, who was assigning who should hold the gun and who should do it. As soon as I saw that the situation was not good, I wanted to withdraw, but unexpectedly, my plan had been recognized. At that time, Lu Laisheng announced to everyone that I was a detective accomplice, and that the faces of each person had been recognized by me, and I could not be allowed to go out. Then, someone was immediately sent to monitor me, prohibiting free action. Unsuccessfully, they dragged me into a car and drove directly to the front of Xu Wenliang's house. Although I did not agree to enter, the situation did not allow it. If I disobeyed, I would be shot to death, so I was forced to enter. However, after robbing the valuables, they wanted to kidnap Xu. I slightly stopped them and was violently beaten by Chen Zhihong with the butt of a gun. The head was severely injured and I immediately fainted. If the generations</p>
<p>Suspected I Was Dead</p>
<p>They abandoned me in the wilderness. I woke up three days later, went to the hospital for treatment, and reported to the police station by telephone. The detectives successively arrested the defendants in this case based on my confession. Now I am disabled, because my right eye is blind and my teeth cannot open. I ask for leniency. Chen Zhihong completely denied what Cao Chunbao confessed. Lu Laisheng confessed that I was invited by Shen A'gen. I only knew that I was going to steal, so I had a flashlight with me at the time and no pistol. And when I arrived at Xu's house, I first climbed over the fence and opened the gate to let everyone in. I stood guard outside. Zhang Heshang confessed that he did not know anything about the kidnapping. Because I have</p>
<p>Several Houses</p>
<p>Living in Zhangjia Lane, Nanxiang, I knew a doctor named Ba Shixian, who was a vegetarian. In the morning, Dr. Yan suddenly accompanied a patient to request to stay for one day. I saw that the patient's head and eyes were hazy, because I didn't know that it was a ticket, so I allowed Dr. Yan to let the patient stay for one day. The next day, Dr. Ba took the patient away and gave me one yuan in French currency. I provided three meals. However, Lu Laisheng also came at that time. Zhang Guiqing and Zhang Xu's wife confessed that they were a couple. Zhang Heshang is Guiqing's brother. He knew nothing about the kidnapping. Yang Chunshan confessed that A'da recommended him to cook in Zhenru. Lu A'gen and Tang Heming both confessed to</p>
<p>Being in Charge of Guarding the Ticket</p>
<p>Although Shen Tingyan also admitted to guarding the ticket, he was shot and wounded by the escaped Long-legged when he was arrested. At this time, the police lawyer Zhang Tiansa stood up and declared that when the detectives caught Shen Tingyan, he resisted and opened fire to resist arrest. Then Shen Yuehe tried to escape and was shot and captured by the detectives. When questioned, Du Haisheng and Chen Zhihong both pushed away their confessions. Fan Gang, the agent lawyer of Lu A'gen, stood up to state his fault. Judge Tan said that the location of the incident was in the Chinese community on the road built across the border, so he ordered that the jurisdiction of the case was wrong and should be transferred to the Shanghai District Court for trial. Yang Chunshan and Chen Zhihong were ordered to be held in custody pending rescheduling because they had another case within the border.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Exhibition Hall Commemorates National Exhibition</h3>
<p>Opening on October 1st</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall was established in the 10th year of the Republic of China. It is large in scale and comprehensively stocked. At that time, the founders Nie Yuntai, Qin Runqing, Tian Shilin, and others spent a lot of time planning before it was finally completed. Now, we know that the Chairman of the City Chamber of Commerce, Wang Xiaolai, and the Director of the Exhibition Hall, Xu Xiaochu, believe that the hard work of Nie, Qin, Tian, and others in building the business for fifteen years deserves a grand commemoration. Therefore, they have drafted an opinion paper and submitted it to the Standing Committee of the Chamber for approval to hold a commemorative exhibition, scheduled to open on October 1st. The scope of the exhibition is quite large, divided into two parts: exhibition and commercial. The exhibition part is located on the third and fourth floors of the hall. The commercial part has now been selected at the old site of the Longfei Automobile Company, east of the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. It is noted that the location is densely populated and has convenient transportation, so the effect will definitely be far-reaching. It is heard that the hall has already been actively preparing everything. Wang Xiaolai and Xu Xiaochu have scheduled a banquet at 6:00 PM on the 17th of this month (Thursday) in the Standing Committee Room on the third floor of the City Chamber of Commerce to entertain leaders of various manufacturers.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Writes to Kunming Chamber of Commerce Advocating Domestic Calcium Carbide</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of advocating domestic calcium carbide, the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Kunming City Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, on the 12th of this month, we received a letter from China Industrial Gas Refining Co., Ltd. at No. 537 Liaoyang Road in this city, stating that our company has now created domestic 'Gourd Brand' calcium carbide. According to the Industrial Encouragement Law, we have been approved by the Ministry of Industry for exclusive manufacturing rights, and approved by the Ministry of Finance for exemption from transit tax, and by the Ministry of Transportation and the Railway Department for reduction of transportation fees for state-run businesses. It has now been found that Yunnan Province consumes a considerable amount of calcium carbide (locally called 'coal stone'), mostly imported from foreign countries, resulting in significant losses. Because we know that your chamber has always been enthusiastic about advocating domestic goods, we hope that you will forward this to the provincial chamber of commerce, strongly promote and widely encourage the use of domestic calcium carbide, so as to maintain domestic goods and prevent losses." Upon receiving the letter, we found that the country has always used foreign goods for this calcium carbide. The company has been in operation for several years, simulating self-manufacturing, which took great effort. Now, fortunately, the products are of good quality and have been successful. All our countrymen should switch to domestic products in the future, so as not to let down the hard work of the founders and to recover economic rights. Your province is adjacent to the border with Vietnam, and preventing losses is an important task. You should be happy to promote the calcium carbide produced by the company. Therefore, we are sending this letter to earnestly request your strong support, and to promote the sale of the company's products in your region, so that domestic products can circulate smoothly and reach all places. This would be our greatest hope."</p>
<h3>Lawyer Zhang Bingjun Returns Home Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhang Bingjun, a standing committee member of the Shanghai Lawyers Association, went to Japan at the end of July to study the judiciary.

<h3>Wang Baoliang's Son from the Chaoyang Road Refugee Shantytown Requests Compassionate Allowance</h3>
<p>Wang Baoliang, a resident of the Chaoyang Road shantytown in Pudong, died with resentment because he was forcibly evicted and beaten by the Public Works Department. His son, Chongqi, mourns his father's unnatural death and his own lack of livelihood. He submitted a petition to all the Chinese directors of the Public Works Department yesterday, saying: "Respectfully, I, the afflicted Wang Chongqi, state that my late father, Baoliang, was engaged in the business of Chinese medicine. Before January 28th, he established the Tianyi Feiyao Pharmacy at No. 53 in Chaoyang Road. His business was still able to be maintained. However, when the Shanghai Incident occurred, the losses were quite large. After the war was pacified, the market became increasingly depressed, and the business declined sharply. He had no choice but to close the business and guard his home. His life was difficult. Therefore, he moved from a flat house to a thatched cottage to avoid the wind and rain, hoping that the market would recover and he could still operate his old business. Therefore, the remaining medicinal materials and utensils were all piled in the thatched shed. Because the weather was bad, with strong winds and rain, sometimes stopping and sometimes starting, the thatched shed only existed in form and was not enough to shelter from the rain and wind. Therefore, he took the opportunity to repair it slightly on clear days to avoid the wind and rain and live in it. Unexpectedly, the Yangshupu Police Station came out to interfere and forcibly ordered its demolition. My late father repeatedly explained and reasoned with them, but was rejected. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, the police station suddenly sent a large group of seventy or eighty Chinese and Western detectives, forcibly dragging down the thatched shed at No. 448 Chaoyang Road, where the refugees lived. Passers-by were stunned, neighbors panicked, and the order was chaotic. The Chinese and Western detectives still held police batons and beat anyone they met. My late father was also beaten and injured. When the detectives withdrew, they checked the equipment, which was all crushed under the collapsed shed, in a mess that was unbearable to witness. The accumulation of several years of sweat and blood was almost completely destroyed. None of the medicinal materials and equipment were intact. My late father and mother, seeing this situation, mourned deeply and cried sadly. They even fainted. After the neighbors persuaded them euphemistically, they became mentally disturbed and lost their appetite. My late father and mother were both bedridden, and my late father passed away on the 7th of this month. My mother is seriously ill and has suffered this calamity, which has made her illness worse. She is now dying. I am also unemployed and idle. There are also my wife and two younger siblings, a family of five, who are unable to make a living. The injustice has not been redressed. I don't know when I will be able to seek redress. Rather than being in this dark situation and waiting to die, it is better to inherit the hot blood and avenge my father. Success or failure is just a death. What a pity! However, my elderly mother is old and bedridden, and I have no way to take care of her. My wife and my siblings are afraid that they will not be able to survive. Therefore, after thinking it over, I have no choice but to drink tears, endure my anger, borrow from the east and lend from the west, so as to prevent my father's bones from being exposed and to comfort his spirit. Recalling the cause of my father's death, it was actually caused by the beating by the detectives, coupled with excessive depression. In other words, it was caused by the Public Works Department. In any case, the Public Works Department cannot shirk its responsibility. Therefore, I am presenting this appeal to the Chinese directors. I implore you to show compassion, uphold justice, and seriously negotiate with the Public Works Department to ensure that the perpetrators are punished and that the survivors are given compassionate allowances, so that the living can be cared for and the dead can be comforted, justice will not be extinguished, and justice will still exist. Please also ask the Public Works Department to take into account the livelihoods of ordinary people in the future, and quickly withdraw the proposal to demolish thatched sheds, so as to benefit the people's livelihood and stabilize society. If this goal can be achieved, I will repay your kindness with utmost gratitude. I am specially making this earnest request. Please consider my plight, relieve my distress, and negotiate with the Public Works Department based on reason, giving compassionate allowances and compensation, then the gratitude will be endless."</p>
<h3>Zhuang Jimeng and Zhang Zuming's Self-Accusation Case Was Judged Yesterday The Defendants Were All Found Not Guilty, and the Ancillary Civil Suit Was Rejected</h3>
<p>The ancillary civil suit was rejected. Zhou Jinggeng, a compradore of the Xue Mailuo Accounting Firm at No. 9 Edward Road, ordered his employees to collect 18,000 yuan in cash from the China Industrial Bank at 3:00 PM on June 9, 1934. Not long after returning to the office, they were suddenly attacked by bandits armed with weapons, who robbed them of 12,000 yuan. After reporting to the French Concession Police Station, the suspect Zhang Zuming (shareholder of Ruichangxiang Hardware Store on Broadway Road) was arrested. According to Zhang's confession, Zhuang Jimeng (owner of Zhuangyuan Big and Small), Zhu Suyou (hardware peddler), and Tang Qingyue (president of Dade Hospital) were subsequently arrested and prosecuted by the Second Special District Court. After the trial, Zhang, Zhuang, Zhu, and Tang were acquitted. Because the Police Department appealed, the Supreme Court upheld the original judgment after three trials. After the judgment was finalized, Zhang Zuming hired a lawyer to submit a petition to the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, accusing Zhou Jinggeng, Gao Yushu, Feng Ti, Wan Guirong, Qian Genghua, and Wang Guixiang of perjury, false accusation, and fraud, requesting an investigation, and filing an ancillary civil suit seeking 50,000 yuan in damages for reputational, emotional, and business losses. Zhuang Jimeng also believed that Zhang Zuming should not have fabricated innocent accusations, which led to his arrest and detention. He was unwilling to accept this and hired lawyer Li Guozhen to submit a petition to the First Special District Court, accusing Zhang Zuming of perjury and false accusation, and filing an ancillary civil suit seeking 50,000 yuan in damages. After the First Special District Court summoned them, it ruled that the case should be transferred to the Second Special District Court for trial because the incident occurred in the French Concession and the court lacked jurisdiction. Li Changnian, a former judge of the Second Special District Court, combined the two cases for trial and judgment. Chen Shuoying, a judge, summoned both parties to court some days ago, held a trial, announced the conclusion, and scheduled a date for the verdict. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, when the verdict was due, only Zhuang Jimeng reported to the court. Zhang Zuming, Zhou Jinggeng, and others, as well as their lawyers, did not appear. At 2:00 PM, Judge Chen arrived at the Second Criminal Court and first judged the case of Zhang Zuming's self-accusation against Zhou Jinggeng and others. The main text of the judgment was: Zhou Jinggeng, Gao Yushu, Feng Ti, Wan Guirong, Qian Genghua, and Yu Guixiang are not guilty. The fraud part is not accepted. The plaintiff's claim in the ancillary civil suit is rejected. The judgment of Zhuang Jimeng's case against Zhang Zuming stated, Zhang Zuming is not guilty. The plaintiff's claim in the ancillary civil suit is rejected.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Military Officer Fraud Case Judgment</h3>
<p>Each Sentenced to Two Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Zhu Lingen from Changzhou, Wang Wenxi, and Jin Ayu from Jiangyin recently posed as the headquarters of the Second Division of the Jiangshan County Command in Zhejiang Province at Room 3, Changzhou Hostel, No. 422 Lane, North Zhejiang Road. Under the pretext of seeking employment, they defrauded Yang Pikang, Liu Yuesheng, Wang Guoliang, Tao Jinlin, Yang Baogen, and others of money. After Gu Liancheng, the leader of the detective team of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, learned of this, he reported it to the Huisi Police Station. Chinese detective Shen Jinwen went to arrest Zhu, Wang, and Jin and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the court continued the interrogation. Attorney Li Zhishan of the Police Station prosecuted them for fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Law. Then, Yang Pikang recounted the situation of being defrauded. When questioned, Zhu Lingen, Wang Wenxi, and Jin Ayu confessed that they were also deceived by a certain Yu Dagong and had given Yu a considerable amount of money. After Judge Pan Zhenyang verified the confession, he sentenced Zhu, Wang, and Jin to two months in prison each. After the judgment was completed, Gu Liancheng, the representative of the Public Security Bureau, submitted the case, requesting their transfer, because they had also committed crimes in Nanshi. The court immediately approved Gu's request and ordered the three criminals to be taken back for investigation. After the interrogation is completed, they will still be sent back for execution.</p>

However, on the 6th, Xinyuan Shop suddenly published an advertisement in various newspapers, stating that the 26th issue second prize number 133701 was sold by its branch in sections. This raised questions from the outside world about how there could be two second prizes and who was telling the truth, causing people to be confused. Many out-of-town customers sent letters of blame to Huiliyuan Ticket Shop, causing great damage to the shop's reputation and credit. The shop then hired lawyer Chen Chaojun to file a petition with the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court, accusing Ye Zikang, the manager of Xinyuan Shop, of crimes such as obstructing credit, and requested that he be punished in accordance with Article 215 and Article 313 of the Criminal Law, and filed an ancillary civil suit, requesting compensation for losses caused by the illegal infringement, totaling 10,000 yuan in national currency. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Dai Rongduo of the First Special District Court opened the Fifth Criminal Court for trial. The defendant, Ye Zikang, also arrived with his lawyer. Yao Xingyuan immediately submitted a report on the previous situation, and stated that the defendant's behavior not only damaged the reputation of the plaintiff's ticket shop, but also caused the aviation lottery to lose its credibility. He also presented evidence to prove that the second prize was indeed sold by his shop, and many letters of blame from out-of-town customers. When questioned, Ye Zikang confessed that it was actually a copying error made by an apprentice, which caused the misunderstanding. After the plaintiff came to negotiate, he immediately published a correction in the newspaper. After the lawyers of both parties debated, Judge Dai immediately announced the conclusion and scheduled a date for the verdict.</p>

<h3>Automobile Driver's Union Letter to Workers on Banning Extra Gratuities</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Automobile Driver's Union recently received a notice from the New Life Movement Promotion Association to ban extra gratuities, the union sent comrades Zhu Weichang and Zhang Daxin to draft opinions, attend meetings, and propose discussions. The union considered that banning extra gratuities had a significant impact on the interests of all workers in the city. Therefore, it held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 2:00 PM on the 13th of this month to discuss it in detail and issued a letter to all workers in the city. The full text is as follows: "Our fellow automobile drivers in the city, everyone admits that the New Life Movement has been promoted throughout the country. All the bad habits and unreasonable organizations in the past, no matter how long their history, as long as they do not meet the standards of the New Life, must be abolished and reformed. The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association recently received an order from the New Life General Association to ban the bad habit of all extra gratuities. It has convened three meetings at the Maple Bridge City Party Headquarters. All relevant groups sent responsible representatives to attend. Our union also sent Zhu Weichang and Zhang Daxin to attend the meetings, representing the hardships of the drivers in the city. After several discussions, a draft implementation plan was passed and submitted to the Shanghai New Life Movement Executive Committee for approval, and then promulgated by the city government for implementation. However, the draft has already determined the banning of extra gratuities. Our union representatives, of course, considering the hardships of the workers, could hardly agree and strongly argued at the meetings. They also stated the following four reasons: (1) Our union members work particularly long hours, day and night, and only have one day of rest after five or six days. (2) The workers' consumption during working hours is also particularly large. Every day and night, eating meals, snacks, and pocket money requires a very simple one yuan. If there are business errors, damage compensation, plus the minimum family expenses, the monthly average is at least seventy or eighty yuan. (3) Our drivers' wages are between fifteen and twenty-four yuan per month, and personal life cannot be maintained. (4) The income from gratuities ranges from forty to sixty yuan per month, and it is still received sporadically. Once banned, our main source of livelihood will be completely cut off, regardless of the lives of all the drivers in the city. The above four hardships were strongly argued at the meetings. Our union has the current responsibility to improve working conditions and protect the lives of workers. Therefore, we are informing all the drivers in the city. After receiving the notice, please come to the union within five days to offer your opinions and strive for a good way to survive. Our fellow workers in the city, do not wait and see any longer. You must understand that the New Life must be implemented, and we must also come up with proper ways to maintain our lives. Finished. Wishing you good health."</p>
<h3>Awaiting Trial, a Thief Actually Escaped by Scaling the Wall The Iron Bars in the Detention Room Were Not Enough to Prevent It The Second Special District Court Immediately Issued an Arrest Warrant</h3>
<p>The thief, Wu Asan from Jiaxing (30 years old, no residence), and Wang Agen from Hangzhou (35 years old, residing at No. 17 Zhaozhou Road outside the West Gate), colluded on the first of this month to rob the home of Hong Yutian, a resident of No. 7 Yangyeli, Jialu Road in the French Concession, with weapons and fled with the stolen goods. On the afternoon of the 7th, French Concession detectives Lu Zhulin and Liu Quanrong, together with Inspector Jiang Futian, led Gu Jinchang, a Tongzhou rickshaw puller who was an informant for the victim's family, and first arrested the thief Wu at the intersection of Mintini Yin Road and Xiafei Road. According to Wu's confession, they then went to Room 18, Wuling Apartment, Guifuli, Bai'er Road, on the same night and arrested the thief Wang. The next day, they were sent to the Special Court for interrogation and investigation, and the hearing was postponed to yesterday (16th). During the postponement, the detectives took the two thieves, Wu and Wang, to No. 17 Qiyuanfang, Tangjiajie, Huajie, to arrest their accomplice, Chen Silang, who had already fled after hearing the news and was not caught. Two pistols, nineteen bullets, and fifteen pawn tickets were confiscated, and stolen goods were retrieved from the pawnshops. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court and temporarily detained in the post-trial waiting room, waiting for Judge Zhang Chaozuo to bring them up for trial. Because the case files were crowded yesterday morning, the trial was not held and was postponed to the afternoon. Unexpectedly, while in the waiting room, the two thieves, Wu and Wang, took advantage of the guard's negligence at about 2:00 PM and took off their long clothes, wearing only undershirts and shorts. They forcefully pulled open the iron bars installed on the window and escaped by scaling the wall. It was only a few minutes before the bailiffs and guards of the court discovered it. They immediately searched for the two criminals, but they had already fled without a trace. They immediately reported to the police chief and reported it to Wang Sima, the president of the Second Special District Court, and Yang Peng, the president of the Third High Court. Together with the chief secretaries of the two courts, they went to the waiting room to investigate. On the one hand, the court ordered the suspension of the trial of the case and issued an arrest warrant. On the other hand, the French Police Department printed photos of the two criminals and notified the Public Concession Police Station and the Chinese Public Security Bureau to assist in the investigation and arrest. It was found that the thief Wang had also committed theft in the Public Concession before and was sentenced to 14 years in prison by the Lao Zha Zha Police Station of the First Special District Court. He was released on parole on October 17th of last year. Before a year had passed, he committed another robbery. He was incorrigible and will probably not escape the law.</p>
<h3>Wharf Coolie on Guangfu Road Kills Boatman Over Dropped Sacks of Flour Ten People Arrested for Interrogation</h3>
<p>At about 8:00 AM yesterday, in front of the Fuxin No. 1 Flour Mill on Guangfu Road, west of the Xinzha Bridge in Zhabei, while loading flour, more than ten wharf coolies were loading flour onto a boat. Suddenly, a rice boatman went to the vegetable market to buy vegetables with a basket. In order to avoid a car and a handcart, he collided with a coolie, and two sacks of flour on the coolie's shoulder fell to the ground. The coolie became furious, grabbed the rice boatman, and beat him violently. After the rice boatman walked a few steps, he immediately fell in the middle of the road in front of the factory, bleeding from his mouth and nose, and his feces were also discharged from his lower body. The murderer, seeing that he had caused trouble, immediately escaped. Later, after someone reported it to the police, they arrested the foreman Gao Yujie, witness and cobbler Chen Qifu, and coolies Xia Yubao, Zu Rongchang, Liu Wanqian, Zhang Rongchun, Zhang San, Liu Er, Ma Siyang, and Zhao Er, a total of ten people. On the one hand, they instructed the local guarantor Shen Xiaowu to report to the Shanghai Local Court for inspection. At about 4:00 PM, prosecutor Tang Ruxiu was dispatched to the scene and determined that the death was caused by injuries. The deceased's name was He Sannan, 44 years old, from Yixing. He had a younger brother named He Shengda.</p>
<h3>Came to Shanghai to Make a Living, Sadly Beaten to Death Russian Barbarian Refused to Bury the Body Fellow Villagers Request Redress</h3>
<p>Chu Afeng, 28 years old, was from Baziqiao, Wuxi. He had been working as a cook for Westerners in Shanghai. Three months ago, his Western master went to Beijing to take office, so he lost his job. He was unemployed in his hometown. Recently, forced by the need to make a living, he came to Shanghai to find work and stayed at No. 24 Henry Road, Albert Road, in the garage of his friend Lu Xigen's master (also a servant). Unexpectedly, on the 9th of this month, he had a verbal argument with another servant named Xu Rongbiao. He was falsely accused of being a thief. A Russian named Qiaoqi (transliteration), an advertising worker for Huilingdeng on Beijing Road, used his fists and feet to beat him, causing him to die from his injuries. The Chinese constable on duty at the alley reported it to the Fulili Road Police Station, and the Russian was arrested and sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation. The Russian still falsely accused the deceased of being a thief, trying to shirk his responsibility. Since the deceased had no family or friends in Shanghai, his friend Lu Xigen reported the situation to the Wuxi Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai for relief. The standing director of the association, Liu Xin, investigated and confirmed the facts. He hired lawyers Wang Fubi and Sun Zuji to draft a petition for redress and planned to convene an emergency meeting to deal with the situation. It is heard that the deceased's wife (in his hometown) is only 19 years old and is about to give birth. Hearing this tragic news, she is also miserable.</p>

<h3>Cook Bravely Captures Thief Police Station Greatly Commends Master Avoids Loss</h3>
<p>At around 3:40 PM yesterday, three robbers went to No. 8, Lane 167, Xiaoshadu Road, to commit a robbery. Only one of the three robbers had a gun. After entering the house, they went upstairs one after another. Regardless of the robbers' true strength, the cook saw through their act. Seeing the armed robber striding up the stairs, he took advantage of his unpreparedness, snatched the robber's gun from behind, and held the robber around the waist, preventing him from breaking free. The two robbers in front saw the situation and knew that the matter had been exposed. They hastily turned around and fled. The trapped robber was arrested and taken to the police station after the master ran to report to the police. The gun was taken into custody. Therefore, the family avoided loss. The police station highly commended the cook who bravely captured the thief.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Jiang Datian Embezzles Huge Sums, Flees from Japan to Shanghai, Victims Track Him Down and Return to China, Now Suing in Court - Jurisdictional Issues Awaiting Clarification -</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Jiang Datian ran a Gonghe General Merchandise store at 1-chome, Motomachi, Kobe, Japan. Yang Weiren was an accountant at a money shop in Kobe. On June 25 of this year, Jiang Datian and Yang Weiren, under the pretense of trading in gold, swindled Pan Liansheng, an overseas Chinese in mainland China, out of 4,400 yuan. At the same time, Yang Weiren also embezzled 6,500 yuan from his manager, Xu Linshu, at the money shop where he worked, totaling 10,900 yuan. Pan Liansheng and Xu Linshu successively tracked them to Shanghai and reported the case to the Nanshi Branch for investigation. However, Yang Weiren's guarantor was a disciple of Jiang Datian, so he asked Jiang Datian to invite Xu Linshu to the Deyilou Teahouse in the Yu Garden in the Old City God Temple to negotiate a settlement for the embezzled 6,500 yuan, using a 2,000 yuan deposit slip from the Siming Bank dated March 8. While they were negotiating, Pan Liansheng found out and rushed to the Detective Division to detain Jiang and Yang and hand them over to the local court. Prosecutor Mei ordered them to be detained. In addition to Xu Linshu requesting investigation and the 2,000 yuan deposit slip that had been seized, Pan Liansheng hired lawyer Shi Qinghua to file a criminal complaint. Yesterday, Judge Lu Hongze held a court hearing and stated that the crime occurred in Japan and it was doubtful whether this country had the jurisdiction to hear the case. The issue of jurisdiction was unclear and should be submitted to the Judicial Yuan for clarification before further processing. The case was suspended, and the defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

<h3>Zhabei Guoqing Road Daylight Robbery, Four Robbers Caught on the Spot, One Box Cannon and One Handgun Seized, Stolen Money Totaling Over Nine Hundred Yuan, One Robber Released from Prison Only Seventeen Days Ago</h3>
<p>Yesterday at around 10:00 AM, a robbery occurred on Guoqing Road near Changqing Li in Zhabei. At that time, a man resembling a shop clerk was riding in a rickshaw when he was stopped by robbers posing as detectives who robbed him of a bag of legal tender. Wang Meigu, a police officer from the 21st post of the Wuzhen Road police station of the Xinzha Public Security Bureau, heard the alarm and immediately rushed to pursue the robbers. The four robbers fled east via the New Garbage Bridge in the concession. At that time, detectives Wei Sikai (transliteration), Sun Aizhong, Wang Dongchen, Qiu Zhenting, etc., from the Tilanqiao and Huisan police stations were inspecting the area. The four robbers, seeing that they were being pursued, could not stop and rushed straight into the concession. The detectives, seeing their suspicious behavior, immediately blocked their path. The robbers were about to fire their guns to resist arrest, but the detectives preemptively disarmed one robber of his box cannon and found a bag of legal tender on another robber. Knowing they were criminals, they arrested all four. At this time, the robbery victim arrived and they were all taken to the police station. An inspection of the paper bag revealed over 900 yuan of legal tender. Knowing the situation was not good, the robbers placed a handgun under the table, but it was discovered by the detectives. As the case originated in the Chinese area, they were briefly questioned before the four robbers were taken back to the scene of the crime for investigation. The robbers identified themselves as Wang Decai, 48 years old, from Yangzhou, residing in a straw shed on Qimei Road, a bamboo craftsman; Shen Xigen, 38 years old, from Donghai, residing in a straw shed in Pudong, a leather craftsman; Guo Jinfa, 33 years old, from Xuzhou, residing in a straw shed in Gaolang Bridge, a hardened robber who had previously committed robbery and served a 16-year sentence in the First Special District Court, released from prison only 17 days ago; and Yang Dashizi, 24 years old, from Yancheng, residing in a straw shed on Meizhou Road, unemployed. The box cannon was seized from Guo Jinfa, and the stolen money was found on Yang Dabaozi. The handgun also belonged to this robber. The case has now been sent to the Xinzha Branch. According to the plaintiff, Zhu Shaofang, 48 years old, from Ningbo, residing at 18 Baokang Li, Zhejiang Road, he had obtained 1,000 yuan of legal tender from the distribution office of the China Match Company in Baokang Li, Zhejiang Road, at around 10:00 AM today, and was taking it to the China Match Co., Ltd. manufacturing plant on Pingjiang Bridge, Zhonghua New Road, to pay wages. He did not expect that after passing from the concession to the Chinese area, after riding only ten steps in a rickshaw, the robbers would stop the rickshaw and rob the bag of money from behind the rickshaw. They then told him not to make a sound or they would shoot him. Questioning officer Huang Zhuojie then questioned the robbers one by one and ordered them to be taken back to the concession by the detectives, pending the dispatch of personnel to the First Special District Local Court for questioning and to request their extradition for trial.</p>

<h3>Municipal Public Safety Bureau Plans to Recruit Lost or Abducted Women and Children, Agreement to Show Films, Families Can Check and Identify First</h3>

To improve the effectiveness of the search, in addition to arranging for the Shen Bao and Da Gong Bao to have special columns for recruitment, posting the age, appearance, and clothing of the lost or abducted women and children, they have also written to the China Film Association's Shanghai System Branch, asking the Central, Donghai, Penglai, Xihai, and World cinemas to promote recruitment during previews.

<h3>Fuxingheng Criminal Lawsuit, Embezzlement of Silk Case, Court Orders Suspension of Trial, Civil Lawsuit in Progress</h3>
<p>Sichuan Fuxingheng Money Shop and Tongfeng Silk Shop at 20 Jingxing Li, Tianjin Road, in this port are involved in a lawsuit in the First Special District Local Court due to a dispute over mortgaged raw silk. Li Xiangchi, deputy manager of Fuxingheng in Shanghai, initially filed a civil lawsuit against Xu Ziwu (also known as Wu Gao) and Zhu Xingzhai (also known as Shiku), managers of Tongfeng, to return the stored silk. Now, they have filed a criminal self-accusation against Xu and Zhu for embezzling the stored silk. The case has already been heard once, as reported in this newspaper. It is now known that after Xu and Zhu were sued, Zhu claimed to have left Shanghai long ago and could not be summoned. Xu hired lawyer Shen Shiyi to file a statement, stating that the defendant had never met Li Xiangchi before. The silk mentioned by the plaintiff was not a stored item, but a collateral for a loan from Li Jixiao, manager of Shanghai Qianjixiang Silk Shop, totaling over 60,000 yuan in national currency, with accounts and records to prove it. Li used the silk to obtain a loan from Tongfeng, sometimes using the name Qianjixiang and sometimes using the name Fuxingheng, without distinction. The reason for this case is that Qianjixiang owes Tongfeng over 310,000 yuan in national currency after deducting the proceeds from the sale of the mortgaged silk, and a judgment has already been issued. However, Li Jixiao, manager of the shop, harbored ill intentions, appealed the judgment to resist enforcement, and suddenly changed Qianji's business to Fuxingheng's name. Li himself secretly returned to Sichuan and colluded with Li Xiangchi, whom he had never met before, to file a civil lawsuit against Tongfeng for the return of the stored silk, intending to obtain the surplus value of the mortgage. Seeing that the civil case might result in an unfavorable judgment, he filed a criminal lawsuit as a tool of intimidation. It can be seen that the plaintiff intentionally fabricated the lawsuit. The court should find the plaintiff guilty of false accusation and suspend the trial of this case, pending the conclusion of the civil case, before proceeding. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng held a continued hearing. Defendant Xu Ziwu and his defense lawyer Shen Shiyi appeared in court and explained the previous situation, stating that although Qianjixiang and Fuxingheng have different names, they are actually the same entity. Both shops are managed by Li Jiqing, who delivered the Sichuan silk as collateral for the debt, not as stored silk as claimed by the plaintiff. Since the case is already in civil court, the court should suspend this case and wait for the civil court to resolve it. As for Zhu Xingzhai, he is old and sick and often lives in the countryside, so he could not surrender himself. Plaintiff Li Xiangchi stated that the silk was actually stored with Tongfeng for consignment sale and was later mortgaged to the Xinfu Foreign Firm on Aierduya Road. The previous civil lawsuit requested a judgment ordering the return of the stored silk, not the recovery of the silk price. Judge Huang ruled that since the case had already been filed in civil court, the court should wait for the civil court to issue a judgment, and approved the defendant's request, ordering the suspension of the trial of this case.</p>
<h3>Ding Xiaodi Faces Additional Charge of Selling Red Pills, Many People Attended Yesterday's Hearing, Ding Claims to Be Falsely Accused by Xiao Mazi</h3>
<p>Ding Xiaodi, a native of Changshu, has been selling rice cakes since he was a child, hence the nickname "Little Rice Cake". He is quite influential in the Xinzha area and has many apprentices. Recently, Wang Sanxiao, residing at 373, Lane 568, Xinzha Road, reported to the police that Ding led a group of people into his house on the morning of the 7th of this month and stabbed Wang five times with a knife. The police sent Wang to the hospital for treatment and attempted to arrest Ding Xiaodi. Ding heard about this and surrendered himself to the police, who sent him to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce presided over the second criminal court hearing. The defendant hired lawyers Zhan Jifeng and Zhan Yigang to represent him. Many men and women attended the hearing. Police lawyer Jiang Baoqi rose to state the case, saying that the case was being rescheduled. The police had discovered that Ding Xiaodi was also involved in the sale of the drug "red pills", so he was now being prosecuted under Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations on the Punishment of Drug Trafficking. On July 24 of this year, the police raided two red pill trafficking locations at 69, Lane 638, Xinpu Road, and 2167, Lane 568, Xinzha Road, and arrested the perpetrators, Yao Zhongqing, etc. During the interrogation, Yao stated that the two locations were actually run by his master, Ding Xiaodi, also known as Little Rice Cake. Yao himself has been sentenced to twelve years in prison and was brought from the Western Prison to testify today. However, in recent days, the police have received several letters from residents of the Xinzha area, all of which pointed out that Little Rice Cake was usually unethical and did all kinds of bad things. Although Yao Zhongqing has been brought to the case, there are many people in the audience, all of whom are relatives and apprentices of the defendant, so he may not be willing to tell the truth. Therefore, he requested that the audience be ordered to leave. The court granted the request and ordered all the audience to leave the courtroom. Yao Zhongqing then stated that he used to work in the firewood shop opened by Ding Fuji, also known as Little Rice Cake. He was later arrested in the red pill case and sentenced to twelve years in prison. However, the red pill case has nothing to do with Little Rice Cake, and he is not an apprentice of Little Rice Cake. The mastermind behind the organization is actually Xiao Mazi Du Mou, etc. The victim, Wang Sanxiao, stated that Little Rice Cake had forced him to become his apprentice, and he refused, pointing out that he was a "little rascal". He bore a grudge and on the 6th of this month, he invited Killer Zhu A Jin, A Hao, Xiao Jiangyin, and A Jin's apprentice, etc., to beat him severely. The next morning, the defendant and five others broke into his house, held him down, and A Jin, etc., stabbed him five times. When questioned, the defendant denied all the charges, saying that Xiao Mazi Du Mou had a grudge against him and incited Wang Sanxiao to falsely accuse him. He requested a clear judgment. Judge Zhan ruled that the investigation was still ongoing and ordered the defendant to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing.</p>

He has already been sentenced to six months in prison and a two-year suspended sentence. Zhou then filed a civil lawsuit to confirm Dunan's living expenses of 15 yuan per month. The first instance judgment was rejected. Zhou was not satisfied and appealed to the Second Branch Court, again requesting confirmation of Dunan's living expenses of 15 yuan per month.

Zhou Yuxuan's appeal was rejected.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the editor, We have read today's edition of your newspaper with great detail about the opening ceremony of our company's new Minben ship. However, please note that there are a few inaccuracies in the content that need to be corrected: (1) Under the headline "Opening Today in Chongqing", it states that "freight revenue alone is over 60,000 yuan, not including passenger fares", which is far from the truth and based on inaccurate hearsay. (2) Under the headline "Continuing to Build Seven Ships", it further states that our company will "build seven new Sichuan ships in Shanghai, and the construction costs have been submitted to the shipyard and sent to the company for review in preparation for construction", which is purely fictitious and not true. We are writing to request that you correct these inaccuracies. Sincerely, Min Sheng Industrial Co., Ltd. Shanghai Branch, September 15.</p>

<h3>Football Season About to Begin: Various Teams Actively Recruiting Talent</h3>
<p>Western League Approves Dong Hwa Game at Municipal Stadium</p>
<p>Dong Hwa's Goalkeeper Selection a Problem, Forward Line Already Decided</p>
<p>Cao Qiuting and Luo Douwen Already Key Forces for Jin De Association</p>
<p>The Western League football competition is scheduled to begin on the last Saturday (26th) of this month. Dong Hwa team, an important mainstay of the Chinese teams in the Western League, has been actively recruiting talent in recent days, hoping to organize a complete lineup. The details obtained are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Stadium</p>
<p>After the Dong Hwa football team of this session decided to use the Jiangwan Municipal Stadium as its main venue, all future competitions will be moved to that stadium. This proposal has now been accepted and approved by the Western League. Regarding the transportation problem when Western teams compete with Dong Hwa, the Western League has also decided on a solution. However, the issue of ticket distribution has not yet been discussed.</p>
<p>French Businessmen</p>
<p>The defending champion French Businessmen's Association has virtually no changes to its lineup this year, remaining exactly the same as last year. They are eager to make an attempt to win the championship again. Their strength should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>You You</p>
<p>Last year, You You Association had extremely poor luck in Group A. This year, after its owner, Cheng Yize, suffered economic setbacks and reluctantly handed over the team to others, the team members have scattered. The old team members have returned to Jinan University one after another. Even Xiao Heitan (Little Black Charcoal) Chen Zhenhe recently sent a letter from Europe to a friend, expressing his intention to return to Jinan University to serve his parent team. Although the youth team will be the main force of You You this year, most of them have joined Jin De, so the strength aspect may be inferior to last year. Therefore, it has been decided to join the Western League Group B competition.</p>
<p>Jin De</p>
<p>The emerging powerhouse Jin De Association this year should not be underestimated. The association is organized by the Chung Hwa Book Company. In addition to the large number of youth team members who have joined as the backbone, Luo Douwen has also decided to enlist. Two generals from Dong Hwa will also transfer to Jin De. In addition to Zhang Jinhai, who has already made a decision, Cao Qiuting, the famous left winger Xiao Sanzi, is also under consideration and is likely to happen soon. Currently, besides the above-mentioned few people, Jin De also has Xu Jingcheng (You You), Xu Buyun and Wu Zhenxiang (Youth), Gao Xiquan and Yu Yunsheng (You Sheng), and the famous small ball player Jiang Laichen, and old team members Gu Jingchu and Xu Guisheng, a grand sight, the strength is exceptionally abundant, especially the forward line is the most sharp. They are now requesting the Western League Standing Committee to join Group A. Let's see what happens next.</p>
<p>Dong Hwa</p>
<p>Cao Qiuting was responsible for the left wing in Dong Hwa. Now that Cao has moved elsewhere, Dong Hwa has decided to replace him with Wan Xianghua. He was previously punished by the Western League and suspended from playing for a year and a half. Now he is taking it up again. How his skills will be is a matter of concern to fans. Dong Hwa has decided to appoint Sun Jinshun as left forward, Dai Linjing as center forward, Xu Wenkui as right forward, and Jia Youliang as right wing. However, Sun and Jia are still in Europe and will be difficult to arrive on time for the first game. During this time, Dong Hwa will of course have to find someone else to fill the position and are currently looking for someone. Feng Yunyou will serve as center back, and Li Yichen will be transferred from the forward line to the defense line. Dong Hwa now has four defenders: Yichen, Li Ning, Gu Shangrang, and Guan Xun'an. Guan and Gu once represented Shanghai in Tianjin to attend last year's Tianjin-Shanghai inter-port competition. This year, because there are too many defenders, they will probably serve as midfielders. As for the left midfielder Zhou Guangzhong and Zhang Jinhai, they are both new stars selected from Group B last year, but this year they have successively left Dong Hwa. Zhou has decided to go to North China to work, and Zhang has joined the Jin De Association. As for Dong Hwa's goalkeeper talent, they are currently looking for it everywhere. Dong Hwa is extremely hoping to invite Xu Heng to join, but Xu's idea has not yet been formally expressed to anyone. Iron Gate Zhou Xianyan has decided to decline returning after returning from overseas. Therefore, Dong Hwa's responsibility for goalkeeping will be entrusted to Zhang Rongcai in the future.</p>

<h3>Rotary Club Regularly Holds Amateur Charity Boxing Match</h3>
<p>Scheduled for the Evening of the 26th of This Month</p>
<p>At Gordon Road Stadium</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Rotary Club recently plans to donate 40,000 yuan in national currency to the Zhongshan Hospital organized by Yan Fuqing (to be established soon at Fenglin Bridge), specifically for the relief of disabled children. The Rotary Club has decided to raise funds separately for this huge donation. In addition to planning to invite Chinese and Japanese athletes from the World Games to hold a grand charity match when they pass through Shanghai on their way home, it has now been decided to hold an international amateur boxing charity competition at the Special Police Stadium at the intersection of Gordon Road and Avenue Road (behind the Metropolitan Ballroom) on the evening of the 26th of this month (Saturday). The ticket proceeds will be allocated to the donation. The details obtained are as follows:</p>
<p>Entrust Lafay to Invite Competitors</p>
<p>After the Rotary Club decided to hold an international amateur boxing charity competition, it has now entrusted Mr. Lafay, the organizer of the famous professional boxing competition in Shanghai, to invite first-class amateur competitors in Shanghai to participate in this grand charity competition. Mr. Lafay is the one who broke the world record by sitting on a high pole in Lafay Garden for more than forty days. He has extensive social connections and has organized various professional boxing competitions in Shanghai in the past. He has extremely rich experience. Since accepting the commission, he has now invited the most outstanding competitors from six countries, including China, the United States, England, Portugal, Russia, and Korea. Detailed lists and classification allocation are still being arranged and will be announced within this week.</p>
<p>Ambassador's Son Participates Righteously</p>
<p>Gu Weijun, the current ambassador to France, has two youngest sons who are currently studying at the American School in this port. Under the influence of famous teachers, they are skilled in boxing. They have participated in competitions in Western clubs and have excellent skills. They are popular. They do not easily attend on ordinary days. This time, because it is a charity, they also participate righteously. However, the two sons only weigh 100 pounds each, so it is extremely difficult to choose opponents. Lafay is currently looking for them. It is predicted that these two little heroes will definitely give the audience a very satisfactory contribution. The competitors from other countries are also first-class candidates in Shanghai. The United States has decided to send personnel from the Marines to attend. The excitement of the competition at that time can be praised without saying.</p>
<p>Promote Boxing and Give Preferential Treatment to Students</p>
<p>Charity match tickets are divided into four types: four yuan, three yuan, two yuan, and one yuan. They have now started to be sold. The Rotary Club has entrusted members Guo Baoshu, Shao Youlian, He Lin, and non-members Lu Huayi, Guo Li'an, Guo Huide, and Li Baojun of Huadong Sports Equipment Company at 583 Jing'an Temple Road to promote sales to the Chinese. Other committees are also selling to Westerners. As a result, all 440 four-yuan seat tickets have been sold out. Only a dozen tickets of three yuan, two yuan, and one yuan are available for sale. In order to promote boxing, the Rotary Club especially welcomes student groups to visit. Tickets can enjoy a 50% discount, but only for the one-yuan seat. The two-yuan and above tickets are for charity purposes, so there will be no exceptions.</p>

<h3>You Xing Fabricates Competition Results, League Council Decides to Punish</h3>
<p>You Xing's Score Reduced</p>
<p>Kang Di Promoted to Runner-Up</p>
<p>The Shanghai China Tennis Federation held a committee meeting yesterday to investigate Kang Di Team's evidence protesting You Xing Team's fabrication of the results of the competition with Hua Qiang Team in this year's Xian Fang Cup. After several studies, the members of the committee considered that You Xing's actions violated the spirit of sports and were inappropriate. Hua Qiang's failure to request correction and report after the incident was also negligent. It was resolved to cancel the scores of both parties in the competition to show a warning, and to instruct that everything should be based on the spirit of sports and sportsmanship in the future, and that similar events should not happen again in order to respect the spirit. According to the report, You Xing's victory over Hua Qiang was originally 15-0. Now that there is such a punishment, You Xing's current score has been reduced to 114 points (there is still the first doubles match with Xia Cun that has not been played). Kang Di will get 127 points and will be promoted to runner-up.</p>

After completing the inspection in Suiyuan, they took the Eurasia jumbo jet from Baotou at 1:00 PM on September 2nd and safely arrived in Ningxia at 3:40 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, landing at the airport outside Xiguan. Tong Yaohua, Director of the Department of Education, led important officials from the department and principals of secondary schools to welcome them. The summer training camp for primary school teachers in the province was also postponed for several days. The 300 people lined up outside Xiguan to greet the inspectors with respect in the afternoon. Guo and others entered the city and stayed at the Yinchuan Hotel. After visiting Chairman Ma in the afternoon, they were entertained by Director Tong. It was decided that at 9:00 AM on the 3rd, the welcome meeting for the entire education community of the province (all primary school teachers and persons in charge of secondary schools) would be held in the auditorium of the provincial government. Dai, Guo, and Mei gave speeches respectively, giving encouragement. The meeting ended at 11:00 AM. In the afternoon, Guo and others inspected Ningxia Middle School, Ningxia Normal School, and Hui People's Normal School. At the request of Chairman Ma, a banquet was held at Lumu Tower.

In the evening, they attended Dafu's banquet at Dafu. Dafu paid close attention to the improvement of the living conditions of the Mongolian people. He specially sent a letter to the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund, requesting subsidies for the improvement of animal husbandry and public health, and prepared a letter to Chairman Zhu Liuxian, which was forwarded by Director Dai, which was sufficient to show Dafu's enthusiasm for governing the banner. On the morning of the 6th, they departed from Dingyuanying and arrived in Ningxia at 1:00 PM. At 3:00 PM, accompanied by Director Tong, Inspector Pi, and primary school instructors, they went to various counties to inspect. First, they went to Ningsuo (60 miles from the provincial capital) and inspected various schools, and then stayed at the county government. On the morning of the 7th, they set off again, passing through Xiaoba to see the Han Yan Canal irrigation, and decided to go to Daba to see the Tang Lai Canal irrigation. At noon, they arrived at Zaowei Fort in Zhongning County to inspect the Zaoyuan County Primary School.

The large-scale summer training camp held this year includes all primary school teachers, local education administrators, and secondary school students, which is indeed a new initiative in Ningxia's education and is of great benefit to the promotion of education. As for the education of the Mongolian banner in Ningxia, Alashan Banner has established five primary schools, and is preparing to establish a girls' primary school, with Dafu's wife as the principal, which is sufficient to show Dafu's enthusiasm for education. Finally, he praised the scenery along the Yellow River and the convenience of the canals, which are deeply sufficient for the development of the Chinese people.

<h3>Wu Baojin Returns Home After Studying in Japan</h3>
<p>Impressions of His Time in Japan</p>
<p>Wu Baojin, former secretary of the Municipal Security Bureau, was dispatched last year to study in Japan and Germany. He first went to Japan and was admitted to the graduate school of Tokyo Imperial University. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the President McKinley and is staying at the New Asia Hotel. Our reporter made a special trip to interview him, and his remarks are as follows:</p>
<p>There are many reasons for Japan's current state. To summarize the main points, the country's small size makes it easy to develop and govern. Moreover, the country is surrounded by the sea, which makes transportation convenient and facilitates contact with other countries' cultures. Therefore, it has been able to absorb the strengths of Western Europe while discarding its own dross. In addition, after the Meiji Restoration, the feudal lords returned power to the emperor, thus unifying the country in both name and reality and stabilizing social order. This was also aided by the establishment of a police system and the beautiful customs of diligence, frugality, and imitation among the people, as well as the division of labor between husbands and wives. Almost everyone in the country, directly or indirectly, participates in public and private production. They have few extravagant or wasteful habits and few bad habits, so social problems are less common than in other countries. In recent years, the country's foreign trade has had a monthly surplus. At a time when the entire global economy is in recession, its goods are still able to compete in various markets. This is undoubtedly due to its low prices, high quality, and unique management methods. Furthermore, the government allows people, especially intellectuals, to continuously improve their treatment and provides them with equal opportunities in their careers. This not only allows them to fully utilize their talents but also reduces the number of unemployed. Therefore, the general livelihood—the so-called "basic standard of living"—is relatively stable.</p>
<p>In the country, most low-level occupations and light industries are occupied by women. This not only cultivates women's sense of serving the country and sharing its burdens and gaining economic independence but also forces men to engage in heavy industry and aspire to great achievements.</p>
<p>The cultural level of the country is high. Since the implementation of a six-year compulsory education system (the Ministry of Education recently proposed extending it by two years), illiteracy has almost disappeared. Moreover, the proliferation of supplementary, technical, and vocational education, as well as the abundance of books and magazines, and the rapid introduction and dissemination of new knowledge from other countries, can be said to be a culmination of translations from various countries.</p>
<p>Japan and Russia can be called the hegemons of the Far East. After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan jumped into the ranks of the great powers. In addition, its coastal location and lack of domestic raw materials have prevented it from being coveted by developed countries. Therefore, in order to survive and defend its nation, it has instead gained the opportunity to rapidly expand its army, navy, and air force and expand its foreign markets. It has a strong sense of being the sole leader in Asia. Triggered by the Manchurian Incident, due to its geographical proximity, economic, political, and military conflicts with Soviet Russia often arise, and there have even been intentional or impulsive steps towards conflict. Domestic public opinion has been boiling as a result. However, this is merely empty rhetoric in written battles. In reality, concrete actions by both sides are not imminent.</p>
<p>On the other hand, due to the country's natural advantages and the diligence and fortitude of its people, it has been able to join the ranks of modern emerging nations. However, because its national strength relies heavily on external forces for its self-sufficiency in production, it has the regret of being hollow and upside-down at its core. Moreover, the annual budget is inflated, and the people feel burdened by taxes and public debt. This is a point that cannot but be worried about. As for the inside and outside of its society, it cannot exceed the scope of the iron rules of the current system. However, general observers are prone to superficiality, only observing its one-sided advantages and forgetting deeper observation. Yet, deeper understanding requires a longer period of time to delve into the depths of society and experience it in many ways. Looking back at our country's long history and unique culture, and based on the research of scholars from various countries, the Chinese people's excellent minds, broad minds, sharp thinking, and far-sighted vision are all top-notch. Therefore, the following is expected:</p>
<p>Select outstanding young adults from across the country for organized military spirit, vocational skills, and practical training in international knowledge, preparing them to be powerful new cells for national rejuvenation, so that they can one day fill the ranks of various production departments and the pillars of national defense.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are more things that China should develop than any other country at present, so the need and cultivation of talent are also more urgent than in other countries. We can take advantage of the frequent external turmoil and the subtle international relations to create an opportunity for the revival of national fortune. The whole country should conduct a census of talent so that they can be assigned to various tasks, ensuring that knowledge is applied and efficiency is increased in various undertakings. Without violating the law or affecting public order, they should be granted freedom of thought, so that the spirit of all countries can be extended and a wide range of unique insights and objective comments can be offered to the country. Instead of regarding them as a social hindrance, it is better to gather and channel them to transform them into a cohesive force for the masses.</p>
<p>After carefully selecting and employing those who have clarified history and governance, it seems appropriate to implement a lifetime employment system, a pension system, reduce administrative regions, cut superfluous agencies, clarify rewards and punishments, eliminate bad habits in the bureaucracy, purify personnel in the officialdom, raise the salaries of middle and lower-level employees, and consolidate their duties. In this way, both the method of governance and the people being governed will be well-prepared, which may be beneficial to the future of the country.</p>
<p>The situations of different countries are different, so their needs are different. It seems inappropriate to blindly adopt or imitate other countries while obliterating a country's uniqueness and creativity.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese deeply appreciate the motherland's years of continuous progress and policy measures, as they are keenly aware of the stimulation of external pressure and hope for the motherland's revitalization. They deeply hope that the people of the country will not betray their ardent expectations. This trip was hasty, so I am only publishing one aspect of my observations. If there is an opportunity in the future, I will discuss it in a special article.</p>

<h3>Zhou Houxu, Candidate for the National Assembly Education Association, on His Opinions on Today's Education</h3>
<p>Twenty Opinions Expressed</p>
<p>Zhou Houxu is participating in this year's National Assembly Education Association election. Mr. Zhou is from Jiangdu, Jiangsu, and holds a master's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States. He has traveled to Europe, America, and Japan to observe education. He has served as a professor at the former National Guangdong University, Southeast University, and Henan Zhongzhou University. He is currently the principal of Yangzhou Middle School in Jiangsu Province, a position he has held for ten years. The school's status and management achievements have long been known to the public and need not be elaborated. His writings have been published in various newspapers and magazines. Our reporter met with him yesterday. Mr. Zhou expressed his support for open and fair elections, which are followed by various countries around the world, and also the demeanor that educators should have, and he is happy to be the first to advocate for it and create a fair election atmosphere. The reporter then asked him for his views on future education. Mr. Zhou summarized his usual performances and recent claims and presented them to each point for publication:</p>
<p>(1) The highest principle of education in our country should be to reward integrity and revive the nation, and the necessary path should be to concentrate national strength to engage in production and national defense construction. (2) Strive to promote the popularization of compulsory education, shorten the completion period, and strictly formulate supervision and assessment methods. (3) Elementary education should focus on the physical development of children and the development of good habits, and should not focus on the instillation of knowledge. (4) Educational funding should be expanded year by year. New taxes, such as income tax, inheritance tax, and land appreciation tax, should be allocated to educational funding to develop compulsory education and improve the treatment of elementary school teachers. (5) Youth training should focus on spiritual training and physical training. (6) Youth spiritual training should establish guidelines, such as cultivating integrity, sacrificing oneself for the group, being loyal to the nation, observing discipline, and obeying leaders, and establish detailed implementation methods for schools at all levels. (7) Youth physical training should focus on military operations and outdoor living, and should focus on universal development to be able to endure hardship and adapt to the extraordinary needs of the country. (8) In addition to general knowledge and civic training, ordinary women's education should focus on physical training, household operations, and vocational training. (9) Vocational education should be implemented separately in each vocational area. The number of students should meet the needs of each locality. It is not necessary to rigidly establish a standard of funding proportion with middle schools and normal schools, and make unreasonable expansions. Living education that suits the needs of the nation should be promoted as much as possible throughout the country. (10) Scientific education in primary and secondary schools should strive for popularization and practical application. Equipment should be enriched, experiments should be emphasized, and in universities, research should be emphasized with the goal of production and national defense. In social education, it should strive to be popular. (11) Talent education should select young people with special talents and provide them with special education to develop their strengths. (12) The association and old system should be improved to adopt a stratified and categorized random examination method, so as not to hinder the physical and mental development of young people. (13) Entrance examinations for schools at all levels and various examinations, in addition to focusing on knowledge testing, should also test the study of physical education, labor, and art to promote it. (14) When the ratio of the number of candidates to the number of admissions is too large in entrance examinations for schools at all levels, overall planning should be made to seek relief to reduce the pain and danger of out-of-school youth. (15) Establish and implement the system of seniority pay for primary and secondary school teachers, and the method of resting for one year after serving for nine years, and make a clear order to protect the position of teachers, so that they can serve with peace of mind and regard education as a lifelong profession. (16) Primary and secondary school teachers have great responsibilities and lead hard lives, so a reward system should be established to show respect and encouragement. Children of teachers should be given special treatment in school admission. (17) Teacher training aims to train outstanding young people. In addition to knowledge study, it should also focus on character cultivation and physical training. (18) Teacher training should be encouraged in many ways and given ample opportunities. (19) Encourage excellent private schools and private schools to make up for the shortcomings of public schools. (20) Social education should strive to penetrate into the people and emphasize the training of production, national defense, and national consciousness.</p>

<h3>The Free Sale of Chinese Tea in New South Wales and the Effectiveness of Tea Inspection</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry has always been very strict with the inspection of export commodities, hoping that the quality of export commodities will become increasingly refined, and overseas markets will gradually be opened up. The inspection of export tea is even more emphasized. Those who pass the inspection are given a certificate of conformity before being allowed to export. Therefore, the quality of Chinese tea is steadily improving. According to a report from the Consulate in Wellington, tea exported to New South Wales has always been inspected by the local health bureau. Only those that are deemed qualified are allowed to be sold, and those that are unqualified are not allowed to be sold, and a fine of one pound and one shilling must be paid for the inspection fee. Although most of the Chinese tea exported to New South Wales in the past was allowed to be sold, it was limited to being sold to Chinese people for drinking. Because the Chinese merchants had to submit the tea for inspection, which was time-consuming, and because it was often deemed unqualified, they had to pay the inspection fee. Therefore, most of them directly recognized that the tea quality was unqualified and sold it exclusively to Chinese people. This method has been in place for a long time, causing great losses to China's foreign trade in tea, and causing the reputation of Chinese tea to be tarnished. At this time when China is promoting international trade, it is extremely difficult to allow this practice to continue. The Chinese Consulate in Wellington believes that since Chinese tea has been inspected and qualified by government agencies before being allowed to be exported, there is no need to conduct another inspection on the tea that comes to New South Wales. After negotiations with the New South Wales government, it was requested that imported Chinese tea be exempted from inspection and allowed to be sold freely without special restrictions. The New South Wales government has replied by letter, stating that in the future, Chinese tea that is imported and has been inspected and qualified by the Chinese government with a certificate can be exempted from inspection and will no longer be restricted to being sold to Chinese people.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: The Yarn Market Still Faces Heavy Pressure</h3>
<p>The yarn market experienced a morning drop followed by a recovery in the afternoon, with momentum returning to a state of fluctuation. However, speculators and large traders generally leaned towards selling, exerting significant pressure. Nevertheless, current yarn customers have robust demand, so selling prices remain firm, and the inventory in warehouses is gradually decreasing.</p>
<p>This Month Alone Drops 1.3 Yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the forward yarn market, due to unfavorable overseas yarn and cotton market conditions, prices for all months showed a consistent downward trend. Trading in the market was loose and sluggish, with most people expecting declines. Prices for each month fell by six, seven, or eight cents. Second round trading varied, fluctuating by two or three cents. Third round traders offered support, leading to a sudden drop of seven or eight cents. By the close of trading, short sellers continued to exert pressure, and market conditions changed rapidly. Near-term months fell by seven cents to 1.2 yuan, while far-term months fell by seven or eight cents. Checks revealed that Gengfeng, Runkang, and Fukang were buying heavily, but this still could not curb the speculative atmosphere. Yuda, Taichang, and Hengchang, on the other hand, significantly increased their short positions. The forward yarn trading resulted in price declines for all months compared to the previous day's closing price, ranging from six, seven, eight, or nine cents to 1.4 yuan. The market situation rose slightly at the afternoon opening due to large traders pushing in, leading to a step-by-step increase in the market as inventory was relatively tight. However, a certain individual continued to exert pressure on this month's contracts, further weakening them. Far-term months were relatively firm. As a result, prices for all months rose compared to the morning closing price, by one, two, four, five, or six cents. Checks revealed that Dafu sold 2,100 bales, Yuda 1,050 bales, Huamao 650 bales, Shenji 1,250 bales, Taichang 2,200 bales, Yichang 650 bales, Xiacheng 1,450 bales, Hengchang 1,150 bales, and Chengji 1,100 bales. Jinchang bought 1,050 bales, Juxing 1,150 bales, Gengfeng 2,600 bales, Senkang 800 bales, Runkang 2,000 bales, and Xincheng 700 bales. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Forward Yarn: Highest Price, Lowest Price, Closing Price, Compared to Previous Day, Account Balance</p>
<p>September: 201.8, 201.1, 201.2, Down 1.30, 64,500</p>
<p>October: 201.8, 200.6, 201.1, Down 0.90, 114,900</p>
<p>November: 201.7, 200.6, 200.9, Down 0.60, 142,100</p>

<p>January: 201.8, 201.0, 201.4, Down 0.30, 147,050</p>
<p>February: 202.3, 201.6, 202.1, Down 0.40, 62,700</p>
<p>Total: 682,100</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Can Be Described as Brisk</p>
<p>Current yarn sales are still quite substantial. Checks revealed that a total of 1,390 bales were purchased by various regions throughout the day. Selling prices are firm and stable. Purchase amounts by various groups are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong: 210, Jiangxi: 0, Trade Peers: 190, Inland: 485, Nanjing: 15, Yunnan: 400, Tianjin: 230, Shantou: 45, Wuhu: 15, Xuzhou: 120, Total: 1,290</p>
<h3>Active Spot Demand, Forward Cotton Falls and Then Recovers</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially fell in the morning due to a pullback in U.S. cotton and weakness in Indian cotton. Widespread short selling led to declines. Subsequently, Changhe and Runkang covered their short positions, while long positions were increased. Both sides competed fiercely, market momentum was mixed, and the spot cotton market was favorable. In the afternoon, the market recovered.</p>
<p>Cotton: No Fluctuations</p>
<p>The cotton forward market opened with U.S. cotton weakening and falling by 8 to 14 points, Indian cotton falling by 1 or 2 rupees, and Osaka Sanpin cotton falling by 3 or 4 cents. Market sentiment was weak, and selling pressure was strong. Prices for all months fell by 1.5 to 2 cents. During the second trading session, due to the efforts of Gengfeng, Changhe, Runkang, and Ruida to push prices up, both long and short positions emerged, recovering 5 to 15 cents. By the third trading session, news of weakness in the yarn market caused retail and large traders to exert pressure on October contracts, and the market retreated again. Dafu, Chengji, Yuda, Renfeng, Wang Taixing, Taichang, Changfeng, Shengyuan, and Yongda sold heavily. The forward cotton trading resulted in price declines for all months compared to the previous day's closing price, ranging from 2 to 3.5 cents. At the afternoon opening, previous short positions were covered, and large quantities were bought. In addition, active demand for spot cotton boosted sentiment, and prices jumped by 2 or 3 cents. The market retreated slightly at the close of trading. As a result, prices for all months rose by 2.5 to 4 cents compared to the morning closing price. Checks revealed that Hengyi sold 2,000 dan, Dafu 1,900 dan, Chengji 2,700 dan, Yuda 4,400 dan, Renfeng 2,300 dan, Wang Taixing 3,100 dan, Taichang 3,100 dan, Yichang 3,900 dan, Changfeng 7,500 dan, Shengyuan 3,300 dan, Yongda 3,200 dan, Ruida 4,500 dan, Runkang 10,100 dan, Dachang 4,900 dan, Yuanxingchang 4,600 dan, Changhe 7,500 dan, and Tongji 1,900 dan. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Summary of Yarn and Cotton Exchange News</h3>
<p>Refund of Special Margin: The Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange has been collecting a special cash margin of 8 yuan per bale for new cotton yarn transactions and 3 yuan per dan for new cotton transactions since September 3, as well as collecting margin from one party for new two-way accounts. It is now announced that these measures will be canceled from the 15th onwards. The previously collected margin will be refunded starting today (the 16th).</p>

Additionally, September 30th, the traditional Mid-Autumn Festival, will be a temporary market holiday.</p>
<h3>Overseas Cotton and Yarn Prices Both Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with unsteady conditions, as prices for all months varied from a drop of three points to a rise of two points. Early in the morning, sales were made by Southern and local entities. Subsequently, purchases were made by peers and Liverpool for October and by Wall Street for December. Market prices recovered, but then due to sales from the South, the number of settlements increased drastically, causing a large drop in market price. Some people are paying attention to October contracts, and some are making both near and far-term hedges due to rumors that inventory could increase. The market closed flat and weak. Spot prices fell by 10 points, and futures prices fell by 6 to 14 points. English cotton spot prices fell by one point, and futures prices fell by 5 or 6 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to purchases by speculators and operators, but weakened later due to sales from European exporters and profit-taking. The Pingguoer fell by 2.5 rupees, and Aomula and Bailuoxi fell by 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded to the left (telegram from the 14th):</p>

<h3>Rangoon's Cotton Exports Last Week</h3>
<p>Fourteenth day, Mumbai Telegram: quantity of cotton exported from Rangoon last week valued at 43 tons, all to Hamburg</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Autumn Sales Special, Spot Cotton Cloth Demand Exceeds Supply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market, due to the opening of sales in various regions, although Dongpi white goods were affected by the decline in yarn and cotton prices, falling by 2.5 cents per piece, Qingdao's 14-pound Double Dragon Pearl fine cloth was the strongest in the market due to its scarcity in Shanghai. Currently, various factories are rushing to weave grey cloth, resulting in a significant shortage of finished products. For example, fine cloth and fine twill from factories such as Shanghai Dakang and Tongyu require waiting one to two weeks for a complete empty warehouse order before delivery. The supply of white goods from local factories remains significantly insufficient. Shenxin Factory, which originally produced the most, is now only producing 10 to 20 percent. The price of Xinyu Factory's Earth fine cloth rose by 1 cent per piece, and the price of 18-pound Racing coarse cloth rose by 5 cents due to a lack of goods arriving from Hankou. Coarse cloth and fine twill from various factories are all very attractive. The prices of Chinese and foreign colored cloths are particularly firm and popular, and manufacturers are experiencing a shortage of goods to meet demand. This is because there have been abundant harvests in various regions this year, and the demand for cotton cloth is very strong. Therefore, even if cotton prices fall in the future, the cotton cloth market may still be able to maintain its current momentum.</p>
<h3>Grains: Spot Goods Difficult to Find, No Expectation of Major Loosening in Forward Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, it rose again by five or six cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market, the opening in the morning, prices were largely stable for each month. This month had no movement at the start, and the far-term was also flat. Subsequently, buying interest improved slightly, and prices then were slightly better. By the afternoon opening, because the weather suddenly changed again, people outside the industry suddenly saw good prospects, buying activity came alive, and each month then gained three to five cents. People in the industry thought that spot wheat would be difficult to fall for the time being, and there was no expectation of a major loosening in the forward market. Spot wheat market, high quality goods were still traded, Shandong Yingzhou wheat opened at 5.05 yuan, followed by 5.03 yuan, Yanghe Yaowan wheat at 5 yuan, followed by 4.98 yuan, Qi Guang wheat at 5.05 yuan, Wuhe wheat at 5.03 yuan, Dongtai wheat at 4.84 yuan, Taizhou wheat at 4.79 yuan, Daqiao wheat at 4.80 yuan, Huaian wheat at 4.60 yuan, Hankou wheat at 4.60 yuan, followed by 4.57 yuan, and then 4.5 yuan, and truck wheat at 4.85 yuan, followed by 4.7 yuan. Fuxin bought 7,000 bags, and Fufeng bought 3,000 bags.</p>
<p>Highest, Lowest, Closing, Comparison</p>
<p>September: 4.98, 4.92, 4.98, Up 0.06</p>
<p>October: 5.11, 5.07, 5.11, Up 0.05</p>
<p>November: 5.24, 5.18, 5.24, Up 0.04</p>
<p>December: 5.25, 5.33, 5.35, Up 0.02</p>
<p>January: 5.45, 5.41, 5.45</p>
<p>February: 5.49, 5.45, 5.49, Up 0.04</p>
<h3>Flour Trading Quiet, Market Price Changes Very Slight</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, the market for each month presented an image of initial flatness followed by stability. With foreign wheat quotations, Chicago fluctuated by 1 cent, Canada rose by 3 or 4 cents. When opening prices were made, the clearance of spot flour still showed little improvement, so the opening price for this month was as low as 3.11 yuan, slightly lower by two cents compared to the previous day. From October onwards, with foreign wheat recovering, sentiment was still stable, with little change compared to the previous day. By the afternoon opening, this month due to some short covering, the market atmosphere turned stable, recovering two cents compared to the morning opening. Distant months opened quietly, remaining peaceful. The Exchange has set the 25th of this month as the final day, so within these few days, if actual sales are flat and quiet, then overstimulation is also impossible.</p>
<p>Highest, Lowest, Closing, Comparison</p>
<p>September: 3.1300, 3.1100, 3.1300</p>
<p>October: 3.1725, 3.1575, 3.1700, Up 0.0025</p>
<p>November: 3.1200, 3.2000, 3.2075, Down 0.0025</p>
<p>December: 3.2400, 3.2350, 3.2400, Up 0.0025</p>
<p>January: 3.3775, 3.2675, 3.2775, Up 0.0050</p>
<p>February: 3.3050, 3.2975, 3.3050, …</p>
<h3>New Yangjian Rice Slightly Down One or Two Cents</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various groups only arrived from a dozen or so merchants, with a total of about 2,000 shi. Thick early indica was particularly slow in sales, causing the price to fall by a few cents. However, thin indica relied on the Bao Wei, Qingdao Yantai, and Nanyang brokers for 600 to 700 bags, so the market became quietly tight. The arrival and sales of Dongxin indica were similar, still maintaining the original prices. However, the market for various types of new tip rice was particularly weak. The arrival of new Yangjian rice was plentiful, but sales were poor, causing the price to fall by one or two cents. Lu tip rice also fell by a few cents, and Yinbian rice was mediocre.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various groups along the river were about 20 merchants. Sales of various types of river rice in the market continued, and prices were stable. Bai Po Jing continued to be sold, and prices were stable. New and old Yangjian rice arrivals were not strong, and small sales moved slightly. Market prices were stable, and prices for port tip rice rose slightly as port brokers' sales moved. Prices for guest tip rice were stable. Western new indica was scarce, and Dongxin indica and other goods were in a stable situation.</p>
<h3>Large Arrivals of Guest Xian Rice, Sales Conversely Slow</h3>
<p>Yesterday's guest xian rice market, sales from this group were difficult to be strong, but with more arrivals than sales, prices continued to decline. There were 30,000 to 40,000 new bags arriving in the past two days. Yesterday's guest sales were only about 8,000, so the market has already been trending downwards. Currently, the Guangdong brokers are also quiet. Yesterday, only 2,000 bags of Hanjing brown rice were traded. Therefore, all grades, high and low, continued to fall by 4 to 5 cents, or even a dime. However, the Shantou brokers were more active yesterday, and the lower prices led to even stronger buying interest. The entire city traded more than 5,000 bags. This street's appetite was relatively weak, only selling 1,750 bags. The amount opened yesterday was 1,750 bags of Gan rice, 1,750 bags of Xiang rice, 1,000 bags of Han brown rice, 883 bags of Jing xian, 55 bags of Tai xian, and 500 bags of Yue xian.</p>
<h3>New Sesame Market Atmosphere Stable</h3>
<p>Recently, more than a thousand bags of new sesame have arrived in Shanghai, but most of them are used by goods merchants to settle ocean bills for clean goods. Only a small number are circulating in the market for transactions, so with flat sales, the market is able to remain stable. Although prices show differences, when new goods enter the market, there are relationship factors, and rises and falls cannot be discussed. Although ocean settlement goods are standardized, the news price has ups and downs. Yesterday, Daifu Foreign Firm ordered 100 tons for delivery before a specified month, priced at 12.225 yuan and 12.25 yuan. Looking at the overall situation, there is not much glory or disgrace. Yesterday, spot goods were purchased by Shantou, Fuzhou, and this street, including more than 800 bags of Shashi sesame, 60 bags of Hankou sesame, 14 bags of Puzhen sesame, and 4 bags of Chongming sesame.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: New Red and Black Dates are Both on the Market, New Walnuts Must Be Sold at a Loss... Thousands of Bags of Black Melon Seeds Heard to Be Shipped</h3>
<p>Red Dates: The first batch of new Tianjin cotton red dates, numbering more than a dozen pieces, arrived and were sampled yesterday. Because the goods were damp and soft, they opened at 5.2 yuan. Secondary goods were slightly cheaper. Based on cost, there must still be a loss.</p>
<p>Black Dates: The first batch of new Jinan black dates, numbering a small amount, also arrived. The goods were relatively small and damp, and were opened immediately, with a price of 12 yuan (date specification).</p>
<p>Walnuts: A batch of new Tianjin walnuts arrived yesterday and was opened immediately. The goods were still good. It is heard that the declared cost must be 26 yuan, but they only opened at 24 yuan, a loss of 2 yuan.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market: Hainan Red Recovers Two Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was stable. The association set the price for No. 24 coarse white sugar spot at 21.55 yuan, and transit goods at 6.575 yuan, both with transactions. Dongbai No. 4 spot was at 21.25 yuan, and transit YP mark at 6.25 yuan. No. 8 spot was at 21.15 yuan, and transit at 6.15 yuan.

A batch of No. 1 goods with dampness was opened by Zhengfa, 51 bags, at 15.15 yuan. Also, Da Xing Hao opened 150 bags of Hainan red, at 13.8 yuan, a recovery of 2 cents compared to the previous time. The asking prices for Chaoqing were all tight, with no transactions.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Transactions Rather Sparse</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silk market appeared rather erratic, with New York and Yokohama showing divergent rises and falls. New York spot rose by half a cent, and futures rose by one cent. Lyon day silk fell by 0.50 francs, Guangdong silk rose by 0.75 francs, and Shanghai silk maintained its original price. The Yokohama silk market opened with spot falling by 5 yuan and futures falling by 6 yuan in the morning, and then fell again in the afternoon. The Shanghai silk market was firm. B-character white factory silk, 20-22 denier, the foreign firms opened at 600 yuan, but manufacturers held prices around 630 yuan, making transactions difficult. Yesterday, only Lixinfu and others brought in 93 bales of white factory and double palace silk. On the user side, apart from Mei Ya Factory in Shanghai having some scattered purchases, the rest were also very quiet. Yesterday, Hangzhou brokers slightly increased their intake, but the number of bales traded was not large. The total number of bales traded in the city was 153.</p>
<h3>Red and Green Tea European Sales Very Clear</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market remained sluggish. British firms Xiehe and Yihang and other firms intended to absorb large quantities of Qimen black tea, and the Anhui and Jiangxi Black Tea General Sales Office also urgently awaited the end of operations, discussing countermeasures. The evaluation of quality and the level of market prices are currently underway. As for green tea, there were not many transactions due to the lack of high grade inventory. Although there were tens of thousands of boxes of ordinary Zhenmei, Huacha merchants were unwilling to compromise too much due to shrinking foreign prices, and market conditions could not improve. However, there were some scattered sales of Zhenmei and Pearl Tea.</p>
<h3>National Goods Female Interviewers</h3>
<p>— Ignorant</p>
<p>This time the city's national goods movement federation, in order to awaken a group of numb and obsessed women who love to buy foreign goods, specially recruited female interviewers, is in formal training, will soon begin to work. Although only three, but the author hopes that they can complete the immense mission they bear!</p>
<p>Indeed, in Shanghai alone, the import of foreign goods, in addition to machinery, clothing, food and cosmetics, accounts for the majority, from shark fins and rouge, in recent years, the shocking number of imports, can get a considerable proof. But these things, are not all through the hands of the housewife? If the housewife is determined not to use foreign goods, then shark fins and rouge, etc., how can they invade the family?</p>
<p>It can be seen that female interviewers go to each dispatched family to interview housewives, expounding the danger of loving foreign goods, which can promote the destruction of China, and turn around to use national goods, which is certainly an important work, directly promoting national goods, and indirectly saving the country. There is more than one way to promote national goods, female interviewers are just one kind of thing that people engaged in the national goods movement have thought of. In the past, all comrades who participated in the national goods movement, oral speeches, written works, and the organization of national goods exhibitions, etc., were also important work, were they not?</p>
<p>But unfortunately, those noble women, modern ladies, someone gives a speech on national goods issues, do not go to listen, newspapers and magazines, rarely look at once or twice a year, as for the national goods exhibition, national goods market, national goods movement, etc., then they have long made up their minds, not to buy some things. Therefore, you despite trying all kinds of methods to promote the national goods movement, they still buy foreign goods as much as possible, what does not matter.</p>
<p>Okay, now by female interviewers to each family, or in women's groups to visit, then just receive, those noble housewives, modern ladies, female interviewers' advice and election, in any case, should be audible, compared to the national goods exhibition, the national goods movement and them, naturally can be more close and effective.</p>
<p>However, female interviewers visit each family, whether the housewife entertains, after the reception, whether to accept the advice? There are still many problems, of course, there are still many difficulties. In Shanghai's situation, if you can not say important things to meet with the owner, immediately rejected by the servants or the guards, is also a common thing. That is, open you in, see the housewife, because you are not related to the people, when you an uninvited guest, look at her white eyes, subject to her cold treatment, is not rare. Therefore, when a female interviewer conducts interview work, she must at least have a spirit of perseverance and full of patience, not afraid of difficulties, not afraid of suffering, endure ridicule, and look at people's cold faces, in order to use various methods to advise housewives to turn around and not use foreign goods.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we deeply know that Shanghai is a very wide place, only three female interviewers, in a short period of time, how can we go through all the families? Therefore, after the female visit begins to work, if effective, we deeply hope that the national goods movement federation can add a few more; At the same time, in major cities outside of Shanghai, groups that promote the national goods movement should also legally employ female interviewers.</p>
<h3>The Mirror of the National Goods Female Interviewers</h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>Good news came, the national goods female interviewers, will begin to implement interview work! This is a new record in the citizens' national goods year! But the national goods female interviewer, bears the important mission of promoting national goods and promoting national goods! How should she be quick with her speech, skilled in her skills! To achieve the goal of housewives loving national goods, this is worth observing.</p>
<p>In this newspaper's weekly increase in punishment, Ms. Zhuang Xueyin's "Confessions of a Professional Woman" article, she worked as a female runner's interview experience said: "Sir, you must know that we are not here for us to sell goods to you, I am here to help solve the important problems of the family, it can also be said to be for you to economically make a plan, will certainly make you get perfect happiness..." Also said: "... Visit the housewives of the family, based on "mother love" and easy to impress her hope heart on this point, the results are very impressive!... Usually unintentional communication, we must give people some good impression everywhere! It's not about how you can decorate? How will you do? And in your calm and sincere, moved the people who come and go with you, naturally, the local dialects! At least be able to speak Mandarin, English, and local dialect, is also an important tool in social gatherings..." Ms. Zhuang's golden words from experience, it is indeed worth the national goods female interviewers to learn, the author specially put forward, wrote Siwen.</p>
<h3>Counseling by Example</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>I have read many articles in newspapers and magazines saying, "Students should use the summer vacation to persuade the public to buy domestic goods." At first glance, I thought this was a good idea, because students are intellectuals, and people have a certain respect for them; moreover, they have sharp minds and persuasive eloquence, and their publicity is bound to achieve twice the result with half the effort. However, upon careful study, it is just on paper and absolutely impossible. The reason is very simple, because most students today are promoters of foreign goods. They wear foreign clothes and use foreign goods. How can you ask them to promote the use of domestic goods? Wouldn't that be a great joke? Perhaps students will get angry when they read this, but this is the truth, without any slander. Therefore, I say that instead of asking students to persuade others during the summer vacation, it would be a practical way for them to make a determination to use domestic goods first.</p>
<p>Students have a sharp pen to write a few articles on using domestic goods, and a silver tongue to talk about saving the country, but the reality is just the opposite. I think this is a shameful thing. A few years ago, I followed a domestic goods propaganda team to work in the countryside. In a teahouse, we met an old gentleman with a rigid mind. He listened to the speeches of several team members, and at first he nodded and applauded, expressing his approval. Later, the old gentleman suddenly noticed that one of the team members was wearing a Western suit under his gown. He suddenly slammed the table and shouted, calling him "a beast in clothing!" and "outwardly benevolent and righteous, but inwardly a male thief and female prostitute!" He roared like a madman. Despite repeated explanations, he would not stop. Some busybodies also echoed him. As a result, not only was the publicity unsuccessful, but we had to retreat in defeat. The lesson learned from this incident is that to persuade others, you must first "lead by example."</p>
<h3>Hua Yi Industrial Cooperative's Security Lamp</h3>
<p>Recently, many Chinese people have made new inventions in industrial products and have applied to the government for patents, which shows the rapid progress of domestic production. Among them is a chemical battery security lamp invented by Zhu Jianlin and Liu Ziyi. It is made entirely of domestic goods. It relies on chemical action to generate electricity. Its light is no different from ordinary electric lights, and it is half as economical as kerosene. Moreover, it is convenient to use and has no danger. The Ministry of Industry has approved the patent, and the manufacturing plant is located at 963 Dongjing Road, Shanghai. The scale is grand, the equipment is precise, and it is managed entirely by scientific methods. It is divided into five groups: machinery, manufacturing, medicine preparation, materials, and electricity. They are working actively. It is expected that this lamp will be welcomed by the society when it is launched. From then on, the light will spread far and wide. Even in remote areas without electric lighting equipment, people can enjoy the benefits of electric lights. This is truly a good phenomenon in the domestic goods industry.</p>
<h3>Author's Important Correction</h3>
<p>In my previous article in this journal, "The New Activity of the Domestic Chemical Electric Essence Lamp," I mentioned that Hua Yi Industrial Cooperative had temporarily stopped operations. Now, after investigation, this is absolutely not true. According to the Ministry of Industry, Hua Yi Industrial Cooperative's patent has been clarified and received long ago, and its business scope extends to various regions, with outstanding reputation. I am afraid that the outside world will spread false information by mistake, so I specially make this solemn correction to clarify the facts and express my sincere apologies! Autumn Man respectfully.</p>

<h3>Factory Visits and Home Visits</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Five ladies are responsible for home visits, shouldering a great mission. They will depart to the western part of Shanghai soon to conduct home visits. Before their departure, they first make factory visits, which is of great significance and the steps are very proper. It is imperative to elaborate on this:</p>
<p>The purpose of visiting housewives is to explain the importance of promoting domestic goods. However, promoting domestic goods cannot be done with empty words. There must be genuine knowledge and insight to tell people the actual situation and objects. All raw materials collection, manufacturing procedures, new working conditions, and their effects and advantages should be explained one by one, as clear as a palm. Then they can gain the housewife's confidence and arouse their enthusiasm for using domestic goods. In particular, how to use, store, maintain, and be economical in using a certain product should be delivered in a guiding manner, tireless and serving every family in a practical way. Taking Wuzhou, Zhongfa, Xin Asia and other pharmaceutical factories as examples, a small booklet of essential medicines for a family should be set for housewives as a consultant. Then, taking Sanyou Hongxin and other cloth factories as examples, how to cut children's clothing, give away clothing and limit prices and how to allocate, the visiting staff should design it for housewives in the long run. In addition, for daily necessities, based on the most economical and effective small family calculations, how many kinds of goods should be prepared can also be considered for a single list for housewives' reference. All of these cannot be done without first going to the factory to see the details. Mr. Hu Xitu, Xu Xiaochu, Xiang Shengwu and Lu Zhixue all have rich experience in this matter. They believe that before the visiting staff set off, they should first listen to the talks of the leaders of the domestic goods industry and see the situation of each factory with their own eyes, and then they will have confidence in their chest and handle things easily. This is a real insight from experience. I sincerely hope that all visiting staff will practice what they preach and do it practically. I also hope that housewives will consult and discuss at any time when they encounter problems. If there is any dissatisfaction, speak directly so as to promote the improvement of the industrial sector. I respectfully contribute my words as an aid to the beginning of the home visit business.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Drunken Woodcutter)</p>
<p>A person with physical disabilities is the most painful and pitiful person in the world! If we are healthy, we should have sympathy for them; when necessary, we should also try our best to help them, so that their painful hearts can be deeply comforted; but in fact, this is not always the case.</p>
<p>We see actors in dramas pretending to be hunchbacks, cripples, blind people, etc., deliberately making them lifelike, winning laughter from the audience. I feel that society is always deformed! There are also some people who, when they see a beggar with a missing hand or foot begging for pity, quickly avoid them, not wanting to bring this hateful form into their eyes, leaving an unpleasant impression. This kind of person will never know how unfortunate the disabled are, and at the same time, they do not understand that human beings should have a responsibility to help each other!</p>
<p>"A plate of loose sand"! This humiliating hat has finally fallen on the heads of us Chinese people. Are we going to throw away this hat? What's more, in the current China with physical disabilities, how much we need a healthy group to help him! So that he can safely pass through the difficult times of wind and rain; then the great success of "mutual assistance" will shine a dazzling torch in the world!</p>
<h3>The Ominous Character "West"</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Speaking of this character "West", it originally did not have much meaning: if you want to study the origin of the character, then: it is nothing more than saying that its usage is obtained from pictograms; because the first character was just a bird perched on its nest, its head was still facing west, so its graphic was structured into the appearance of halogen, and later the seal script became regular script, and it became the "West" style. Who should study the original initial intention?</p>
<p>Now, the character "West", I say that there is some ominous bad luck coming to his direction. Don't you remember that when the communists were causing chaos in the past, didn't it happen in the two provinces of Jiangxi and Shanxi, causing misery to the people? It was because of the character "West" that they suffered from war and hardship. This is not long ago, and I think everyone can still remember it! If you talk about it farther away: from history, hum! Western Xia, Western Liang, etc., which one did not have to fight against the Han soil? Speaking of foreign countries, last year's Abyssinia was completely defeated by the violent Italy. Even if King A was unwilling to surrender and resisted for more than seven months, in the end, he just had to leave the motherland created and passed down by his ancestors and escape to other countries to save his life. Otherwise, the mustache on his mouth would inevitably be made into a board brush, and the black-clothed prime minister would have to brush his leather shoes. You think! Isn't that also suffering from the result of this "West" character!</p>
<p>Well, the recent military changes have happened in the southwest. In fact, it is only in Guangxi Province. Although there is no problem in Guangxi now; but isn't Spain also rebelling from the "Western" Morocco? You must know that this is no small matter. If you pull this hair, the whole body will really move. I am afraid that the prophecy of 1936 will unfortunately come true. What's the reason? Because this fuse is hard to guarantee that it is not the opening of the Second World War in Europe, and especially in Europe, a bloody drama will be staged in the future! If you don't believe it, please watch!</p>
<h3>Patterns</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Since mankind has possessed the modern art of appreciation, everything is distinguished by lines. Lines are divided into straight lines, curved lines, thick lines, and narrow lines, and thus patterns arise. Although patterns are made up of uniform and coarse lines, in reality, things will not always fit the pattern. However, intelligent people have the ability to transform reality into patterns, or patternize them. Even the outline of a person can be transformed to have the lines of a pattern.</p>
<p>Women's new fashion publications are full of full-page new fashion patterns. Although some people suspect that patterns are just patterns, clever fashion designers can cut patternized new clothes according to the patterns. Girls wrap their non-patternized bodies in patternized new clothes, becoming a patternized and modern beauty. Three-dimensional shoulders, streamlined waist, turn fat and bloated into slender, and thin and skinny into plump. Appropriately arranging the lines, it is not difficult to turn ugliness into pattern beauty.</p>
<p>The skills of fashion designers are so superb. At the same time, beauticians can transform the faces of girls to fit the pattern beauty. Although everything on a person's face is born with it, small eyes can be transformed into not too big or too small, just right, and fit the lines and structure that should be in the face shape. The lines of the ears, nose, mouth, and lips can also be transformed according to the beautiful pattern. In the pattern, sometimes, in addition to the simple lines, for the sake of balance, several dots are needed for embellishment, so artificial moles or artificial freckles have to be used. And the eyebrows, which are generally considered the most difficult to solve by girls, have now invented glued-back artificial eyebrows. There is also eyelash glue for gluing eyelashes together. It is definitely not difficult to glue three or four eyelashes into one. Therefore, in ancient times, there were only true-to-life beauty paintings. This year, it has progressed to transforming into patterned beauties. This is the so-called not being dominated by the era, but mankind dominates the dynasty.</p>
<p>In ancient times, mankind was dominated by the era, so everything was left to natural progress. Three hundred years, four hundred years, still did not jump out of an original model, which was quite sparse and plain. This year, mankind is dominating the era. Even in terms of architecture, 1934 and 1935 each had their own patterns, and 1936 naturally has the pattern of 1936. Therefore, although the pattern is just a simple picture composed of several lines, in reality, patterns can be said to be one of the driving forces of modern civilization.</p>
<h3>Eliminating Preconceptions About Famous Actors</h3>
<p>— Si Su</p>
<p>What is performed on the stage is Peking opera, and what is performed by the Peking opera troupe in the amusement park is also Peking opera; however, the audience has a preconceived notion that the plays performed by the two sides cannot be regarded as equal, and the Peking opera in the amusement park is certainly not as good as the Peking opera on the stage.</p>
<p>This preconceived notion is not necessarily wrong. The amusement park is a place where all kinds of plays are mixed together. Although Peking opera occupies a major position, it is ultimately one part of the plays and cannot be compared with the stage. Moreover, actors with status are mostly unwilling to join the Peking opera troupe in the amusement park, fearing that this will damage their status. They would rather be the third or fourth rank on the stage than be the champion of the Peking opera troupe in the amusement park. This is another inconceivable preconceived notion held by the actors themselves.</p>
<p>However, to say that it is "naturally not as good" is not right. That is a preconceived notion, and it is not impossible to eliminate it forever. Like the current Xian Shi Amusement Park Peking Opera Troupe, the important actors they hire are all characters from the stage in the past: Wang Qichang is the son of the old actor Wang Hong, who specializes in performing Golden Leopard, Anti-Five Passes, Burning Cotton Mountain, Zhou Yu Returns to Heaven, and red student plays; Hu Yulou is the proud disciple of the old actor Tan Yueming, specializing in leaning on the handle, and is good at performing Pick Hua Che, Eight Great Hammers and other plays; Xia Junting is the grandson of Xia Yueshan and the nephew of Xia Yinpei, and is a famous and strong short-hitting martial artist; Zhao Kuiguan is a northern-style second flower, which is rare in the south. They are all famous actors, but now they are all hired by Xian Shi Amusement Park; on the one hand, Xian Shi Amusement Park is showing its brilliance, and on the other hand, famous actors can eliminate inconceivable preconceived notions, and jointly eliminate the preconceived notions of the public that the Peking opera troupe in the amusement park is naturally not as good as the stage, which is very admirable!</p>
<p>World Rare News</p>
<h3>Japan's Tariff Barriers</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>Western-made cameras, lenses, films, and other photographic equipment require a tax of one hundred yuan for every one hundred yuan of original price. For example, a two-hundred yuan camera purchased in Japan requires a tax of fifty to seventy yuan. Travelers to Japan can only bring an old camera. When picking up friends at the ship, you must bring the camera to the customs inspection office for registration, otherwise there is a risk of being identified as smuggling and confiscated when you return and pass through the inspection office. According to customs officials, "The tariff on cameras is too high, and there is often smuggling, and old goods are easily missed." However, most of this smuggling is for greed, and it is possible to bring one or two more, but large-scale organized smuggling like ours is unprecedented in the world.</p>
<p>There are more than one hundred kinds of goods that are taxed according to the original price. The most important ones are Chinese wine, beer, fur, straw hats, gold glasses, clocks, gramophones, umbrellas, toys, etc. In recent years, these goods have almost disappeared. Chinese wine is divided into five-flavor skin, sorghum, and Shaoxing, and some Japanese shops repackage and sell them in Tianjin, decorating them like beer bottles. Taiwan is experimenting with manufacturing Shaoxing wine, which tastes light and astringent. A Shaoxing wine jar full of colored flowers, sold by a used goods store to a Japanese hotel for decoration, still costs four or five yuan. If it is full of wine, the price is considerable.</p>
<p>After the implementation of the "Specific Duty" in Showa 7, some are calculated by weight, and some are calculated by quantity. As a result, some taxes have increased by 35%. For example, a motorcycle originally had a tax of 93.6 yuan, but now it has become 126.36 yuan. There are about 800 kinds of goods with this kind of production rate, so the price of imported goods has to be expensive. Buying a Chinese-made thermos in Shanghai only costs half a yuan; going to Japan to buy a middle glass bottle costs one yuan. It is common for Japanese goods shipped to China to be cheaper than buying them in Japan.</p>
<p>Since Japan implemented the "gold export re-prohibition"; the exchange rate of Japanese gold has collapsed to one-third, and one American gold dollar is equivalent to about two Japanese gold dollars. Now one hundred Japanese gold dollars are only worth twenty American dollars. Therefore, after adding tariffs, even if European and American goods can be imported into Japan according to regulations, no one will buy them. Our country's tariffs cannot be completely autonomous due to certain relationships, so the tax is lower than in other countries. Moreover, after the price of silver has risen, it is very beneficial for the import of foreign goods, which directly hinders the fate of domestic goods; and some people still criticize our country's tariffs for being too high, which is really a pity.</p>
<p>Personal Vignettes</p>
<h3>George Bernard Shaw's Eightieth Birthday</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw, the contemporary British playwright known as the master of humor, turned eighty this year. July 26th is his birthday. But this time his eightieth birthday will not receive any gifts, and on the eve of his birthday, he refused to see guests and went alone to the墨尔飞 theater to visit his play Saint Joan being staged.</p>
<p>Old Shaw was born on July 26, 1856 in Dublin, England. The plays he wrote are often crowned with a long preface written by himself. In 1867, he went to London to work as a clerk in a telephone company. In 1884, he joined the Fabian Society of Socialism and contributed to various magazines. In 1895, he published drama reviews in the Saturday Magazine. He had long been advocating Ibsenism. He wrote many plays throughout his life, and most of his plays have been performed on stages in European countries with considerable success. He can indeed be called a warrior in the contemporary British literary world. In addition to writing plays, he has also published many works on political economy.</p>
<p>If we are not forgetful, then we will remember that in the spring of 1933, he traveled around the world and once came to Shanghai. At that time, the cultural circles in Shanghai expressed considerable welcome. However, Mr. Shaw stayed in Shanghai for only three or four days before heading north and transferring to Japan. In Japan, he made humorous remarks, indicating that it was a terrifying country, and gave the Japanese an impolite lesson.</p>
<p>Although he is a playwright, he does not like to invest in theaters. Until now, he still adheres to the belief that "a playwright should not invest in theaters." The reason for this is that recently a friend of his who runs an open-air theater wrote to him, asking him to invest in a partnership. In his reply, he not only refused to invest, but also greatly satirized his friend in a humorous tone.</p>
<p>His self-cultivation is peculiar, his thinking is superhuman, so he expresses dissatisfaction with everything in the current society. Although he is a believer in socialism, he often criticizes the actions of the communist parties of various countries. He once denounced Mussolini as a dilapidated car, who only knows how to talk big but cannot do big things. He also does not agree with his plays being put on the screen by Hollywood film companies, because he is afraid that the company will not use his dialogue at all after adapting the film script.</p>
<p>Now that Old Shaw is eighty years old, his spirit is still as vigorous as ever. He is okay when he doesn't talk to people, but when he talks to people, he speaks in a humorous tone, funny and ridiculous, making you laugh like crazy, and there is a knife hidden in the laughter. His words are also sarcastic everywhere, which will really make people laugh and cry!</p>
<h3>Swapped Phoenixes</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 6: Iron Face Sees Kind Heart, Words Deceive Parrot, Emei Preserves Chivalry, Asks About Kunlun</p>
<p>Menglan listened to these words, nodded, and went back to her room. After that afternoon, Menglan herself didn't know what kind of illness she had gotten, only feeling restless. She reluctantly picked up a book to read, but she couldn't make out what the words were. To save trouble, she only pretended to be sick, so she could stay upstairs, not caring whether her family showed any attitude towards her. She stayed like this for two days, so that apart from her father, men and women all came upstairs to ask about her illness. But after seeing her, apart from seeing her deep frown, only the fact that she didn't apply face powder and her face was slightly yellowed could be considered a sign of illness. Everyone also understood that she was suffering from a mental illness. However, everyone only guessed half of the reason, thinking that it was caused by those wedding dresses. The only one who could guess a little more was her female classmate, Ms. Li Youmei. On the afternoon of the third day, Li Youmei came again. As soon as she entered the door, she saw Menglan supporting the table with her hands, holding her head. She was wearing a very thin, old blue wrinkled jacket, which made her look even more weak. She stood at the doorway and said with a smile: Is Lin Daiyu's illness getting better? Baoyu is here. Menglan turned her head and saw her, and smiled: You haven't even entered the door yet, and you're already joking with me. Youmei came in and held both of her hands at the same time, looking at her face. She frowned slightly and said: The sickness on your face is still very strong. Menglan smiled: Before you saw me, did you think I was faking my illness? Youmei smiled: How come our Miss Jiang opens her mouth with barbed words? As she spoke, she lightly patted her shoulder and said: But I don't blame you. You are full of unhappiness, and your complaints are easily triggered. Menglan sat down, leaning on a corner of the table with her, and asked with a bitter smile: How do you know I'm sick? I guess it's because I haven't been to school for three days, so you came to ask about me? Youmei smiled: No, I also have a little private matter to ask you about. Menglan smiled: You know more things than I do, yet you're coming to ask me about them. What is it? As she said this, Xiaoju came with a teapot to pour tea. Youmei didn't answer her words, but took a piece of paper from the table and wrote five words on it with a pen, Kunlun Ma Mole. Then she drew circles densely around the five characters with the pen, looked up at her face and smiled, asking: I don't understand this allusion very well, can you tell me about it? Menglan saw that Xiaoju had poured two cups of tea on the table and was already standing aside, looking at people with a smile, so she said: Little ghost! Go downstairs, what news are you planning to listen to here? Xiaoju said: I have an essay that I plan to use such an allusion, but I'm afraid I'm not using it properly. (75)</p>

<p>Special Telegraphic Edition</p>
<h3>Several Points Worth Noting for Senders and Receivers After the Implementation of the New Rules</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhen</p>
<p>The newly revised charging rules for place names and recipient addresses in Chinese telegrams (hereinafter referred to as "New Rules") are a new initiative in telecommunications this year, closely related to the public. The points worth noting for senders and receivers are described as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Recipient's Name and Address Should Not Be Too Brief　Since the implementation of the New Rules on September 1st, many senders, due to the provision in the New Rules that the number of characters in the recipient's address in various Chinese telegrams, together with the number of characters in the place name, is counted as one character for every two characters, often try to reduce the number of characters in the recipient's address, or only write the recipient's name and omit the address, in order to save telegram fees. According to Article 35 of the current General Regulations for Domestic Telegram Operations, the sender must clearly state the recipient's address and name in detail. If the sender writes the recipient's address too briefly or only writes the recipient's name without an address, it not only violates the above regulations but also inevitably leads to delays. Because Chinese merchants commonly use characters such as "Tai," "Da," "Xing," "Sheng," "Chang," "Long," and "Kang" in their business names, and common people's names are often similar, common business names such as "Tai Chang," "Da Sheng," "Hua Xing," "Tai Kang," "Fu Long," and common names such as "Zhang Ying," "Wang Guodong," etc., often exist more than once in the same place. Telegrams with only the recipient's business name and no address, such as "Zhenjiang Da Sheng," and telegrams with incomplete recipient addresses, such as "Qingdao Feicheng Road Zhang Ying," may be delivered by the Zhenjiang or Qingdao Telegraph Bureau after efforts to find the recipient, but there may be several businesses with the same name "Da Sheng" in Zhenjiang, and there may be more than one resident named "Zhang Ying" on Feicheng Road in Qingdao, making it difficult to avoid misdelivery or misreceipt, or delaying the telegram delivery time due to repeated searches. Therefore, senders must not be greedy for the small benefit of saving a few telegram fees, which may delay the opportunity and defeat the original purpose of sending a telegram.</p>
<p>2.  Charging Method for Chinese Place Names and Address Names　The General Regulations for Domestic Telegram Operations, printed by the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications in September 1935, charged separately for Chinese place names and address names (for example, the place name in ordinary Chinese telegrams, regardless of the number of characters, was charged as two characters, and the address name was charged as three characters if it did not exceed thirteen characters). The revised charging method for Chinese telegram address names counts the actual number of characters in the place name and recipient's address name together, charging one character for every two characters. For example, "Qiqihar East Street (253) Hua Zuguo" has a total of twelve characters, which should be charged as six characters. This charging method is simpler than the old rules.</p>
<p>3.  Advantages of Registered Telegrams　The motivation and purpose of a recipient paying a fee to register at the telegraph office are to benefit themselves and others. The registration procedure is very simple. The recipient only needs to choose a character and pay the fee to the local telegraph office according to the regulations. All telegrams sent to the recipient from various places can use the registered character instead of the recipient's name and address. On the sender's side, it can not only save a few characters of telegram fees but also reduce the trouble of writing the recipient's address in detail, greatly increasing the speed of preparing and sending telegrams. On the recipient's side, since they have registered at the telegraph office, they can print the chosen registered character in advertisements or on letter paper as a commercial promotion. When sending the same telegram or sending a telegram to others, they can use the registered character instead of their full name, paying only for one character, which is more economical than using the full name. In addition, short registered telegrams take less time to transmit at the telegraph office, so senders and receivers using registered characters to send and receive telegrams greatly increase the speed of telegrams. After the implementation of the New Rules, some senders may think that for Chinese telegrams with short recipient addresses, the number of characters in the address name is only six or seven, which is charged as three or four characters for every two characters, which is not much more expensive than using a registered character, and they may no longer use registered characters. However, if registered characters are not used, the above-mentioned conveniences cannot be enjoyed, and when sending a telegram, it is necessary to consider how to write the recipient's address as briefly as possible in order to reduce the number of characters. However, telegrams with incomplete address names are prone to misdelivery, misreceipt, or delays, so senders should still use registered characters.</p>
<p>4.  Standard for Telegram Rates Within the Province or to Other Provinces　Domestic telegram rates have now been changed to two types: within the province and to other provinces. Telegrams sent within the province are charged at the within-province rate, and telegrams sent to other provinces are charged at the to-other-provinces rate, which is very simple and clear. However, for telegrams forwarded by mail or delivered by special delivery, the telegram must be sent by the telegraph office closest to the recipient's location to the post office for forwarding, or delivered by a special delivery messenger hired by the telegraph office. Even if the recipient's location and the sending office belong to the same province, such as telegrams forwarded by mail or delivered by special delivery from Beiping to Nangong (Beiping and Nangong both belong to Hebei Province), the telegram must be transferred through the Dezhou Telegraph Bureau in Shandong during its transmission process. Therefore, it seems that there are some discrepancies in how the telegraph office should charge for this type of telegram. However, since the recipient's location "Nangong" and the sending location "Beiping" both belong to Hebei Province, the telegram should still be charged at the within-province rate. Conversely, if the recipient's location belongs to another province, even if the telegraph office in this province forwards the telegram by mail or delivers it by special delivery, the telegraph office must still charge at the to-other-provinces rate. The distinction between within-province and to-other-provinces rates should be based on the recipient's location.</p>
<h3>Trial Implementation of New Long-Distance Telephone Services</h3>
<p>Since the completion of the nine-province long-distance telephone project and the opening of communication locations in various provinces, China's long-distance telephone business has entered a stage of development. The more users there are, the simpler the procedures should be. Only then can the business develop, which is a logical trend.</p>
<p>According to the regulations, anyone who wants to send a long-distance telephone call, in addition to calling for communication, must report the other party's telephone number when registering. If the caller only knows the name and address of the person being called but does not know their telephone number, they cannot apply for registration and cannot communicate with them.</p>
<p>In addition, for pre-arranged calls, if the designated person being called is not available, resulting in failure to communicate, the caller must pay a fee to cancel the registration. If the caller must communicate, they will have to request a pre-arranged call again, which is uneconomical in terms of time and call charges.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the public and promote business, the Ministry of Communications has made the following two improvements:</p>
<p>(1) If the caller only knows the name and address of the called user but does not know their telephone number, they can also apply for registration. If the reported user is found not to have a telephone installed, or the installed telephone has been renamed or transferred, or the name does not match the name listed in the telephone directory and cannot be verified, resulting in failure to connect, cancellation will be allowed free of charge.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding pre-arranged calls, when the caller registers, they may also request: "If the designated person being called is not available, resulting in failure to communicate, the telegraph office should notify the called user to inform the person being called: The caller hopes to receive a return call at a certain time." After the calling office accepts this request, it should notify the called office to do so. When the called office calls, if the designated person being called is not available, it should immediately notify the called user of the caller's location, name, address, or telephone number, and ask them to inform the person being called to follow the caller's instructions and return a call on time. At the same time, notify the calling office and ask the caller to pay the cancellation fee according to the regulations, without having to pay the call charge. It is said that the above two measures are scheduled to be implemented on a trial basis on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hankou direct circuits starting from October 1st.</p>
<h3>Recent Improvements in Telegram Operations</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>1.  Instructing All Bureaus to Carefully Handle Telegram Code Errors</p>
<p>The Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications recently noted that some publications in the market that publish telegram codes and telegram rules have errors due to careless editing and proofreading, which can lead to mistakes if users are not aware of them. It has specifically instructed all bureaus that, in the future, when translating telegram codes, they should uniformly use the newly compiled Mingmi Telegram Code printed by the Ministry of Communications and must not use other types of codebooks in order to ensure accuracy and facilitate business.</p>
<p>2.  Messengers Should Make Every Effort to Find and Deliver Telegrams</p>
<p>It has been found that there are often errors or changes of address in the names and addresses of recipients. When messengers deliver telegrams, they are often unable to make every effort to find and deliver them due to time constraints, resulting in telegrams not being delivered. In order to improve the situation, the Telecommunications Department has instructed all bureaus that, in the future, when messengers deliver telegrams, if there are errors in the recipient's name and address, they should make every effort to find and deliver them and should not make any excuses. However, when returning to the bureau, they can report the search and delivery situation to the dispatching officer. After verification, the time limit for the delivery can be cancelled, and detailed notes should be made in the delivery inspection form for future reference.</p>
<p>3.  Handling Undeliverable Telegrams</p>
<p>It has been found that there is no fixed procedure for handling undeliverable telegrams, which is inconvenient in many ways. A method for handling undeliverable telegrams has now been established. When bureaus encounter undeliverable telegrams, in addition to notifying the sending bureau of the reason for non-delivery via public telegram for transmission to the sender and registering for future reference, they should also handle them simultaneously according to the following items: (1) Check the address and ask the postman of the postal office in the same area with original recipient name and address for details; (2) If the recipient's address is too brief to be verified by postal office, contact the highest postal office and ask for help; (3) Post announcement about telegram pick-up. In addition to the above, they should also kindly ask the local Chinese and foreign newspapers to publish the telegram pick-up news for free.</p>
<p>4.  Specifying the Route for Telegrams Sent to Canada via International Wireless Telegraph</p>
<p>Regarding the route for telegrams sent to various locations in Canada via international wireless telegraph, the Telecommunications Department previously instructed in a telegram in July that, starting from that day, for telegrams sent to various locations in Canada via international wireless telegraph, if the sender specifies that they should be transmitted via the American Wireless Telegraph Company and the Canadian Pacific Telegraph Company circuits, Via Rca and CanadianPacific Telegraphs can be accepted. However, the route identifier Via Cgra-Rca and Cpr must be added for identification. If only the Traffic Company circuit is specified, the Via Cgra-Rca route identifier will still be used.</p>
<p>5.  Promoting Ready-Made Social Telegrams　Ready-made social telegrams classify congratulatory or condolence messages into telegram texts printed on the back of the social telegram stationery. The sender only needs to specify which group of telegram text they want to send, and the sending bureau will transmit it according to the group number. The receiving bureau will then send the telegram text to the recipient, which is very convenient. However, the above-mentioned ready-made social telegram stationery cannot be opened for business until it has been sent. In addition to the bureaus under the jurisdiction of the Jiangsu and other telecommunications management bureaus that have already been opened, it is reported that the Ministry of Communications has sent the social telegram rules and ready-made social telegram stationery of the Guangdong and Gansu management bureaus. All bureaus will uniformly send and receive ready-made telegram text social telegrams to the Guangdong and Gansu regions starting from August 1st.</p>
<h3>Recent Developments in the Expansion of Long-Distance Telephone by the Ministry of Communications (Continued)</h3>
<p>(2) Provincial Trunk Lines</p>
<p>Among the aforementioned trunk lines and their connecting lines, some have been fully connected and interconnected, while others have only a section of the line connected and interconnected, with the remaining sections not yet connected. The detailed situation is not listed in detail. (Editor's note: The advertisement for the connection and communication of the long-distance telephone trunk line of the Minister of Communications published on the second page of this newspaper today can be consulted by readers) (End)</p>

<h3>The Educational Value of Andersen's Fairy Tales</h3>
<p>— Zheng</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, in the garden of Chinese children's literature in the news, several gardeners transplanted a fragrant and brilliant flower from Denmark. After some artistic cultivation, it bloomed in less than three to five years, attracting all the innocent and lively tourists, making them happy and amazed. ——This was the happiest period after Andersen's fairy tales were introduced into our country.</p>
<p>In recent years, this wonderful flower seems to have encountered the desolation of autumn, and it has gradually withered away. People see it and start shaking their heads. Some even say that it only has the beauty and fragrance of "art" but no practical educational benefits; some even say that its color and fragrance will poison young tourists.</p>
<p>Why did it encounter such misfortune?</p>
<p>The reason is that since it was introduced into China, most critics have only complimented it on the surface. They talk about how skillful the author's artistic skills are, how clever the writing method is, how innocent the thinking is, how lively the words are, etc. From the beginning, very few people have paid attention to the deep meaning and rich educational value contained in each work. Some even say that in order to achieve success in writing art, he deliberately abandoned all materials containing educational value. This is really a thankless and biased praise. In order to excessively highlight half of its value, they have erased the other half of its more important value. ——That is a major reason why people soon become tired of it.</p>
<p>In fact, as long as we carefully savor it and do not pay too much attention to its words and grammar, we can easily see the profound meaning contained in each of his fairy tales:</p>
<p>First, the inspiration of "love." This is almost an element present in every one of his works. It is not found in other fairy tales. He often has sentences of this kind: "The rain clouds just washed the ramie's face, and the sun shone on it, just like a child who had washed his face and was kissed by his mother." In his "A Mother's Story," he wrote that after a child was taken away by death, the mother went out to look for him and met a thicket of thorns. She asked him for directions. The thicket of thorns wanted her to press her chest tightly against the thicket to warm him, and then he would tell her. The mother pressed her chest tightly against the thicket of thorns to warm it; the thorns pierced her flesh, causing large drops of blood to flow out. But the thorns were warmed, drew out green leaves, and bloomed again in the dark winter night. "A mother's heart is so warm!" Later, in order to ask the lake for directions, she was willing to cry out two bright eyeballs for him. She was willing to cut off a head of black hair to ask an old woman for directions. She cried to death for her child, saying, "Give me back my child!" She hated it so much that she wanted to pull out all the flowers in the big greenhouse, but,</p>
<p>Death said, "Don't move them. You say you are so unhappy, but if you pull them out, it will make other mothers just as unhappy."</p>
<p>"Other mothers?" the poor mother said, and put down her hand.</p>
<p>For her own child, she was willing to sacrifice everything; but for all mothers, she had to forgive the sinful death. What a profound and great concept of "love" is implied to the children here! No matter how hard-hearted a child is, after reading this story, they will definitely draw tears of sympathy from the depths of their hearts! He also inspired his young readers: All love should be equal, regardless of wealth or poverty, without high or low. He said, "The starlight shines on all houses, on the rich and on the poor, with the same brightness and the same happiness." He said, "The sunlight kisses the blooming apple branches, and also kisses the yellow dandelions in the fields. They are all brothers, the sunlight kisses them——the poor flowers are the same as the magnificent flowers." When young readers read this kind of passage, how will their hearts be moved? What a good effect will this kind of emotion have?</p>
<p>Second, the inspiration of "wisdom." In his "That's for Sure," he wrote that a hen accidentally pecked off a feather, which was seen by others. After several rumors, it turned into "five hens plucked off all their feathers and died for love of a rooster." Isn't this clearly telling the children that many hearsay things in society are unreliable? Of course, we know that even the news recorded in many newspapers is unreliable, but children don't know this much, so isn't it a good idea to inspire them with an interesting story? He also wrote in "The Leapfrog": Flea, Cuckoo, and Leapfrog compete to see who can jump the highest. Flea and Cuckoo can only jump, and as a result, one jumped out of sight, and one jumped onto the king's face. They were all eliminated. Leapfrog is a thinker. He jumped diagonally onto the princess's skirt; at that time, the princess was sitting on a stool. So,</p>
<p>The king said, "There is nothing higher than my daughter, but he jumped on top of her, so he is the highest. Only those who have thoughts can think of it. Leapfrog makes us know that he has thoughts, he has brains, and he should get the princess."</p>
<p>On the surface, this story seems to be very funny and naive. But after reading this story, any child, in addition to letting out a burst of happy laughter, will definitely explore the reason why Leapfrog was able to get the princess in a serious attitude. Therefore, the two sentences "Because he has thoughts and has brains" are deeply imprinted in their minds. In other words, this story has implied to them: Any noble and hard-won thing can be achieved as long as you are willing to use your mind and brain. Isn't this a very solemn lesson?</p>
<p>Andersen is indeed most painstaking in expressing and storing this kind of implied meaning. Sometimes he selects humorous story materials and deliberately hides the educational components in an appropriate way to make the story more interesting and allow the readers to absorb the lessons invisibly. "The Emperor's New Clothes" is a good example. (This was originally adapted from Don Maonel's "Cunt Luoanor." Gu Junzheng's "Andersen Biography" and Zhao Jingshen's "Collection of Fairy Tale Essays" both mention the ingenuity of the author's adaptation.) He hides the lessons in the original story that are too obvious and difficult for children to absorb in more humorous and interesting words; but he deepens the satire. He not only says that the emperor is stupid, corrupt, and incompetent, but also implies that the so-called "vanity" is self-deception. This is also something that children can understand invisibly.</p>
<p>Third, the inspiration of "goodness." In Andersen's fairy tales, there are several that often have the style of Esho and Tolstoy's fairy tales, but also contain the fun of Grimm's fairy tales. This has an unexpected effect on the enlightenment of children's morality. He often uses scolding the wicked to induce children's "goodness." In "The Bad King," he wrote about a king who did all kinds of evil, often leading his rude soldiers to attack and loot everywhere, and everyone was afraid of him. Sometimes, after attacking a country, he would take all its wealth and tie the king of that country back to his palace, ordering him to kneel at the feet of himself or his ministers and serve them food. Later, he became so arrogant that he wanted to conquer God. But the first time, he was burned half to death by the fire of the angels; the second time, he built countless spaceships in seven years, preparing for a major attack. Just as he was about to get on the ship, many mosquitoes suddenly flew over and stung the king one after another; the king was furious, and the sword beside him also lost its effectiveness, so he ordered people to take a precious mosquito net and wrap his body in it, but a mosquito still drilled in, flew into the king's ear, and stung randomly; so the king's brain was poisoned, tearing open the mosquito net, tearing his clothes, and dancing naked in front of the soldiers, causing the soldiers to laugh. In the end, he said, "The king wanted to defeat God, but he was defeated by a mosquito like this." Here, he not only tried his best to reprimand a cruel and immoral tyrant, but also wanted to induce the young readers to laugh at the tyrant along with the soldiers, making them unconsciously say, "Who told him to be so bad"! At the same time, they received a lesson in their hearts that they "cannot be too bad." In the previous paragraph, writing about his abuse of the defeated king can further arouse their sympathy for the weak and make them aware of the pain of national subjugation.</p>
<p>In his fairy tales, there are particularly many places about satirizing the arrogant, perhaps because he wanted to vent his past frustrations of running into walls everywhere. But isn't the educational value contained in it the same?</p>
<p>In addition, there are several of his fairy tales that contain the idea of the masses, such as "The Little Match Girl," "The Candle," "The Angel," and "There Is Class," all of which are worth introducing to children.</p>
<p>In short, his fairy tales are by no means just a form of leisure that is read and forgotten. When his first fairy tale was published, he had already suffered thirty years of hardship in the world and had experienced the vicissitudes of life. There are sad stories and sweet dreams. Therefore, he had to comfort his remaining life by traveling. He intertwined the worldly wisdom and lessons he had learned over the years in his beautiful fairy tales. They not only grasp the hearts of the young, but also want to transform them before they suffer the hardships of the world: making boys stronger and girls more gentle. Who says Andersen's fairy tales have no educational value?</p>
<h3>Everywhere the Sound of Insects Chirping: It's the Season for Studying Insects</h3>
<p>— Gao Wenlan</p>
<p>Once autumn arrives, the corners of walls, in the grass, on bamboo fences, everywhere is filled with the sound of "Qu-qu-qu, ji-ji-ji." This sound is the orchestra of autumn insects; each plays its own beautiful music, making an otherwise calm autumn night, which easily evokes melancholy, quite lively. Therefore, whether great poets or ordinary people, everyone has a fondness for autumn insects.</p>
<p>Autumn insects are truly a type of insect worth studying. Even if you don't want to become an entomologist and don't want to put your heart into research, you'll probably still want to catch a few to keep on your desk to break the loneliness and for appreciation! So, let me introduce you to reading "Tales of Singing Insects," because this book is of great help to you whether you are studying or appreciating autumn insects.</p>
<p>This book is divided into three chapters. The first chapter is a general discussion of the sounds and meanings of singing insects. The second chapter is about summer cicadas, and the third chapter is about autumn night insects. First, it uses scientific research to introduce the morphology, life, and habits of a type of singing insect. Then, from the literary interest and musical realism, it makes an appreciative examination of the singing insects, with many musical scores of the singing insects' calls attached. Readers can study the pitch and tempo of their songs according to the score. Finally, it explains the methods of catching and raising autumn insects. If we follow these methods to catch a few to keep on our desk, accompanying us in a quiet study at night, there will certainly be a special kind of interest.</p>
<p>It seems that autumn is the world of insects. Not only is it filled with insect orchestras everywhere, but there are also especially many insects that are not musicians. When you are reading or writing at night under a lamp, many insects, big and small, black and green, fly to the light, as if accompanying your loneliness or disturbing your work. Of course, you find these insects annoying and wish you could use some method to kill them one by one. However, these insects are pitiful. They feel the pain of darkness, so they desperately fly to the light, dancing and rejoicing. Their lives end in this one night. Even the long-lived ones only last for a day or two. Because they are pitiful and short-lived, we don't have much interest in studying them. We can study other types of insects with longer lifespans besides singing insects. So, let me introduce you to reading "The Life of Insects" and "Insect Talks." The insects described in these two books are sometimes highly social, sometimes beneficial to humans, sometimes more cruel than wild beasts, sometimes surpassing the achievements of high jumpers and long jumpers in the World Olympics, and sometimes harmful to humans. In all their forms and colors, reading them is like walking into an insect exhibition, meeting Mr. Fabre, a white-bearded French entomologist, who sincerely guides us one by one. The book "The Life of Insects" uses an interesting tone, first using scientific research to explain everything about them, and then using literary interest to write about stories related to humans. The book "Insect Talks" details the types and living habits of each insect. It is a so-called scientific essay and also a special book for studying insects.</p>
<p>When studying a subject, the season is very important. Therefore, in general textbooks, plum blossoms are always discussed in spring, and lotus flowers are discussed in summer. There is never a case of discussing plum blossoms in summer and lotus flowers in spring. This is because of the seasonal relationship, which is convenient for people's research. Autumn is the season for studying insects, so reading these books now should feel particularly interesting. If you like to catch singing insects to raise, then you must keep these books on your desk and browse them frequently.</p>
<h3>Knowledge Nourishment for Young People</h3>
<p>— Wei Qiangling</p>
<p>Scientific essays, which were once popular for a while, now seem to have disappeared like fish after a heavy rain.</p>
<p>I very much hope that there will be such works in bookstores to satisfy my desire for knowledge. Sometimes, when I see something I don't understand, and the author writes it out vividly and clearly, how surprised I am!</p>
<p>Every Sunday afternoon, something like candy lures me to go to various bookstores to search for such works.</p>
<p>"Finally, I found them!" In the bookshelf of the Kaiming Bookstore, I found four books by the Soviet youth writer Ilyin. These books were like several lively and naughty children, all opening their arms and laughing there. I excitedly picked up a thicker one, "Man and Mountain," and opened it to read. I learned that it was about how to use human abilities to fight against nature, to manipulate natural forces with scientific laws, and to make natural forces obey human will. It described the struggle to transform deserts, create new plants, make living maps, harness rivers, and change the weather, explaining that natural forces are not scary things, but our dear resources, and it all depends on human use. He used a light and lively tone, like an older brother writing to his younger siblings, cordial and thoughtful. It's ridiculous, at that time I forgot that I was by the bookshelf in the bookstore, and I read two or three chapters in one breath. Finally, driven by the desire to possess, "I'd rather freeze!" I took part of the money my family sent me to buy autumn clothes and bought back these four beloved books. I spent a week's worth of evenings exploring and reading them all. It turned out that the other three books also very kindly told me many rich pieces of knowledge that I didn't know.</p>
<p>I feel that my behavior was not wrong, nor was I fooled by the bookstore; because I got some rich knowledge that I didn't have before.</p>
<p>The greatest success of these few books is that they can explain complex and mysterious things simply and clearly, and describe the truth of the world with simple and vivid writing.</p>
<p>Van Loon writes about the evolution of mankind from a historical standpoint, which easily gives people a sense of ordinariness; Fabre uses a dialogue format to write about natural science, which requires people to understand deeply; Ilyin, on the other hand, has another way of writing. He uses vivid stories to describe difficult-to-understand emerging sciences, which can capture the reader's full attention. This is where he is more advanced than the two. The books he wrote are the nourishment of knowledge for our young people. We need books written in this way, I can't help but think.</p>
<p>Editor's note: All four scientific stories by Ilyin have been re-translated into Chinese by Mr. Dong ChunCai and published by Kaiming Bookstore. The first type "One Hundred Thousand Whys" is priced at 35 cents; the other three types "Man and Mountain," "Black and White," and "What Time Is It?" are now sold at special prices, please check the advertisement.</p>
<h3>Publication News</h3>
<p>1.  "New Youth" Volume 2, Issue 7, Appendix</p>
<p>"New Youth Reader" Preview</p>
<p>The "New Youth" bi-monthly published by Kaiming Bookstore has been extremely popular with general young readers since its publication. The editors of the magazine originally had a plan to print a "separate appendix" each year to be distributed to subscribers of the magazine. As the separate appendix for the first year of publication, it was originally intended to select some articles suitable for young readers from the works of many contemporary writers, named "New Youth Reader", for new youth to read. Unexpectedly, after starting the selection, it was felt that this work was not easy. Because for a reader specifically for young people, first, the selected articles must be aimed at young people; second, the selected articles must have direct benefits for young people. If these two levels cannot be achieved, the selection work becomes meaningless. So, the direction was changed, and writers were asked to select an article themselves according to the previous two standards; and add a "preface" to explain the motivation, main points, etc. of the article, so that readers can understand more closely. There are now articles by twenty contemporary writers, arranged in new size four fonts with about two hundred pages, and bound separately, scheduled to be published on Double Ten Day (October 10th) and sent to subscribers at the same time as Volume 2, Issue 7 of "New Youth." This reader is exclusively for subscribers of "New Youth" and is "not for sale". If you want to get it, please subscribe to the "New Youth" bi-monthly as soon as possible. The "New Youth" bi-monthly is originally the best regular publication for young people across the country.</p>
<p>2.  "Zhiyan" Issue 25 Published</p>
<p>Special Issue in Memory of Mr. Taiyan</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Taiyan lived in Wuxia and founded the Zhang Clan National Studies Lecture Society; at the same time, he published the "Zhiyan" bi-monthly, which was edited by the lecture society. The writers in it are all famous writers. Since its publication, scholars at home and abroad have all rushed to see it first. Recently, after Mr. Taiyan passed away, his disciples, adhering to his instructions, continued to run the lecture society and continued to publish "Zhiyan". The 25th issue will be specially published as the "Special Issue in Memory of Mr. Taiyan" on September 16th. The number of pages has increased to four times. The most valuable work in it is the final manuscript of Mr. Taiyan's "Supplements to the Ancient Text Book of Documents," and Mr. Taiyan's own description of the order of his academic studies. Starting from this special issue, Kaiming Bookstore will be the general agent for distribution in six places: Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Changsha, Beiping, and Guangzhou. The special issue is priced at 60 cents, the annual subscription for 24 issues is three yuan, and the half-year subscription for twelve issues is one yuan and sixty cents. The special issue is not priced separately. The retail price of each issue is fifteen cents.</p>
<p>3.  Regarding the "Zhang Clan's Works"</p>
<p>The Zhang Clan Series was previously circulated in the world as a woodcut edition from the Zhejiang Library. Mr. Wu Jianzhai of Beiping and others also published a sequel to the Zhang Clan Series to supplement the missing parts of the main edition. It includes "Master Sima Qian's Explanation of the Ancient Text Book of Documents," "Supplements to the Ancient Text Book of Documents," "Questions and Answers on the Doubts of the Spring and Autumn Annals: Zuo's Commentary," "Da Han Chang Yan," etc. The "Examination of the Newly Discovered Three-Body Stone Classics" in one volume is handwritten and photocopied by Zhang's disciple Qian Xuantong, which is very precious. Now, Zhang's disciples have also compiled the third series of Zhang's Works, which will merge the main edition and the sequel and be published by Shanghai Kaiming Bookstore and submitted to the Ministry of Interior for registration according to law. It is heard that the main and sequel editions will be reduced to zinc plates from the original printed editions, and the gentlemen of the Zhang Clan National Studies Lecture Society in Suzhou will add punctuation to the main edition (according to the sequel edition has been punctuated); the third series will be meticulously arranged and proofread by Kaiming Bookstore. Once the entire book is plated and proofread, it will be sold at a special price.</p>

<p>At the eighth annual meeting of the German Social Party on the tenth, Hitler took the stage to deliver an important speech, first saying that all great struggles in the world, in short, are nothing more than mankind's instinct for conservation and the trend of national survival. Down to the modern era, all struggles, tracing their origins, are also determined by the survival purposes of some nations. Hitler's speech was really concise. I not only agree with it one hundred and twenty percent, but also agree with it two hundred and forty percent.</p>
<p>The world today is completely a world of power. How much power and influence you have determines how much territory you can protect. If you have no power or influence, even the land you should protect cannot be protected. Assuming you have sufficient power and great influence, you can take the territory of others as your own. The so-called world of the survival of the fittest is the world today.</p>
<p>But there are two kinds of survival, one is the survival of the strong, and the other is the survival of the weak. The survival of the strong is not satisfied with the existing territory, so they seek colonies or reclaim colonies to replenish their nourishing raw materials and support their people. But the weak should also seek survival and protect their existing territory and existing nourishing materials. Originally, there was something called justice and public law in the world. Now, there is no such thing as justice and public law. There is only survival, only power, and nothing else besides power.</p>
<p>Originally, there was something called the International Court of Justice, the Covenant of the League of Nations, naval treaties, disarmament conferences, and all the clauses of the alliance, which were still maintained on the surface. Now, they have been torn apart, torn up, and thrown into the Eastern Ocean. Everything, everything, only seeks power. Therefore, looking up at the countries of the world today, which country is not strengthening its military and expanding its armaments? The Japanese say that other countries are not allowed to interfere within one country, and the Americans say that their military equipment will be limited by heaven. This saying is not bad at all. In the world of power, only power can deal with it.</p>
<p>But if our country uses power, other countries also use power. Using power to deal with power, then power naturally has differences. The so-called strong will be restrained by the strong. Assuming that one originally does not advocate power, one will naturally be defeated by power. Assuming that one likes to advocate power, but one's ability is relatively small, one will be defeated by the stronger. But turning back to think, if strong countries want to survive, why don't weak countries want to survive? If strong countries want to protect, why don't weak countries want to protect? But what do weak countries use to protect themselves? Do you use justice to protect yourself? Justice has escaped beyond the world. Do you use humanity to protect yourself? Now is an inhumane world. Will you use the clauses of the alliance to protect yourself? The clauses of the alliance have long been waste paper. Then what do weak countries use to protect themselves? It is only hot blood, only black iron, only the unified spirit of the whole country, and a firm and unyielding attitude. It is truly said that if you want my heart, I want your internal organs, fight to the death, and fight until blood flows into rivers. In today's world, this is the only way to deal with it. There is no talk of friendship, no possibility of getting along well, mostly false masks and deception. Hitler's words are…</p>
<h3>Short-Term Elementary School (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ma Jia</p>
<p>Tomorrow afternoon, I will walk from West Shanghai to Zhabei. With a joyful heart, I stepped into the school. The short-term elementary school does not charge tuition, and also gives books, pens, and ink to the children! The children who come to study are all poor, which is what I like, they are also receiving education!</p>
<p>There is still half an hour before class, and my heart is jumping in my chest. I am thinking that I want to turn them into the little heroes in my ideal, those poor children! I am about to see you.</p>
<p>When the bell rang, my heart jumped even more violently. I carried the roster and walked into the classroom. I saw a group of children in ragged clothes all sitting as straight as arhats. Their eyes were all looking at me—looking at me timidly. This made me a little sad. I shouted to them:</p>
<p>"Won't you smile?"</p>
<p>Some of them smiled, and some whispered: "This teacher is quite interesting!" I started calling names, and their names were all very common, like "A Mao," "A Gou," "Little Gou," "Little Mao," "Monk!"...</p>
<p>The classroom doorway was crowded with elementary school students who had just been dismissed. They heard the names that were only shouted at home, but now they were actually being shouted from the teacher's mouth in the classroom. This couldn't help but make them burst into laughter. I shook my head at them, but they ignored me and continued to laugh. I was a little angry.</p>
<p>In order to understand the family situation of those children, I patiently asked them one by one. They were all unadorned and didn't feel anything:</p>
<p>"My dad is a tailor's clerk!"</p>
<p>Those young masters outside the door laughed again, and said in a sarcastic tone: "Ah, a tailor's clerk!" I was very unhappy and glared at them.</p>
<p>The second one who answered me was: "My dad is a cobbler!"</p>
<p>Those young masters outside the door not only burst into laughter, but also shouted loudly: "Can you make me a pair of shoes?"</p>
<p>At this point, I stood up and wanted to drive those young masters away, but the so-called wild children in the classroom shouted: "You know you have money to study! What are you showing off!..."</p>
<p>I quickly closed the classroom door and said to them: "Don't quarrel! Let's read our books! I believe that although we only study for three hours, what we get is definitely more than them! Children! Just be attentive! Be attentive!..."</p>
<p>"We will be attentive!..."</p>
<p>In their shouting, I felt a burst of disappointment: Isn't it? Who separated them so far?</p>
<p>Is it that classroom door?… (The End)</p>
<h3>Autumn Sketches</h3>
<p>— Green Leaf</p>
<p>Autumn is a clear and lovesick season, which is different from spring and summer because of that characteristic. Although spring has the tenderness of the youth age of the season, it does not have the high and clear autumn sky, which makes people have a kind of deep and far-reaching melancholy. Although I am not a poet or writer, the praise for autumn is a melancholy season of entrusting affections. It is autumn that brings insight to the eyes.</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>First, autumn is also a cloudy season. Looking at the clouds from time to time is indeed a unique pleasure: the clouds in autumn are like an oil painting in the style of medieval Spain, depicting the sky with a heroic and vigorous mood, adding a lot of color to the autumn itself. Standing on the small building, looking at the flowing and rolling white clouds on the treetops of the parasol trees, stopping and gazing at them rolling in the long sky, changing in an instant, this can also be regarded as one of the autumn scenes.</p>
<p>And the white clouds and grey dogs in the autumn sky are difficult to predict. Sometimes it is like a shepherd boy and a group of snow-white sheep wandering on the seaside at dusk, sometimes it is like a deserted island at sea and scattered sails, which makes people unable to grasp the magic of the magician's ever-changing tricks. If we sip tea in a small building and discuss the experience of watching clouds and the sayings of ancient and modern times, this is just a little bit, but it is also unique and elegant. This can be regarded as a small feeling of watching clouds.</p>
<p>Secondly, the autumn sunlight is bright. In the morning, walking on the seaside, the sea surface shining with autumn sunlight and the golden shells are smiling brightly and tenderly, which can warm your heart. And on the withered and yellow dead branches and on the red leaf tips, the autumn sunlight is even more cheerful and bright. Strolling on the quiet path paved with the bright autumn sunshine, everything makes you feel complacent and thoughtful, thinking about the autumn of childhood...</p>
<p>At least in my case, autumn is a season I like, making people remember and miss it.</p>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>— Yi Bei</p>
<p>"Human Grass" One</p>
<p>Living in this remote and poor place, the biggest purpose, of course, is to make a not-so-small concession to this incompatible and difficult-to-deal-with life; and what is unexpected is that the form of life, even if it has been simplified to the point where it is almost primitive, yet the wind of the evil century from the outside has not reduced its difficulty by a single bit. And the customs here are so closed and disgusting that it is hard to believe its existence. Because, in this remote corner, the mountains and clouds, those people, those elusive prayers and dreams, are all covered with a thick layer of medieval ignorant dust: there. The distance between the destiny of nature and human wisdom is still so far away. People walk on endless muddy roads in a life of hardship and cruelty. The vast and boundless clouds and sky only give them a feeling of vastness and boundlessness. And the road of their lives, their cruel struggle, is also so vast, empty, broad, and boundless...</p>
<p>However, in this corner of the old and withered world, there are also smart people. They picked up some scraps of fraud and trickery from the vast, evil fighting world. So, when they retreated from the evil fighting and prosperous world, they quietly climbed into this corner of the "outside world", built churches, cheated to get manors, and brought opium, white flour and other things, brought strange gambling tools, and brought a philosophy of life that could add artificial ignorance to primitive ignorance...</p>
<p>And since I lived here, that teaching gentleman who wears the same suit jacket bought from "Hong Kong" all year round, and those tattered long pants without pockets, had to be said to be one of the "smart" people. The men call him "teacher" and call the other incredible people "master", etc. Because, habitually, in this corner, smart people often dominate those "little guys", and that one who is called a teacher, he knows how to quickly improve his life, not only make it "good" but also make it "rich", and he is indeed quite "rich".</p>
<p>When he first came, it is said that he brought a lot of shiny silver coins. He sent them to the people he had carefully selected. As he himself said, he would not do anything in vain. So, soon he separated some other money and deposited it in the opium dens, churches, and poor tenants... By the second year, he became the boss of the opium dens, an important person in the church, and the owner of the land.</p>
<p>No one can imagine him in the dead of night, alone in his windowless hut, checking the large and small silver coins "earned" in a day, a month, or a year, one by one, and secretly hiding them away: but that smile, those strange, perhaps a little terrible smiles, were often carved on his face—that sharp and dry face, on his forehead, at the corners of his mouth, carved with skin wrinkles that were so sharp they were almost like wooden statues, arched, so rigid and even, simply not like what a living being should have; so, at a time when my life was declining even more terribly, he said those terrible "smart" words to me in that expression: "Ah, don't worry at all; life is not a big deal, people can't easily starve to death. You see, have there ever been birds falling from the sky because they starved to death...?"</p>
<p>And really, that proud and relaxed voice made me feel no small surprise. It is rare for birds to fall from the sky because they starve to death; but on the ground, on this human ground, I have seen whole groups of people die of starvation, and that is not just once. I am often threatened by life, so, when finally, that teacher noticed the small gold commemorative ring that I had stubbornly guarded for five years on my hand, and proposed to exchange it with me for five silver coins in my "crisis," I couldn't help but laugh blankly. What is the value of past memories? And when life seems "easy" to a "smart" person, it feels very burdensome to a clumsy person. I like to see the ease of life, but I hate even more the "smartness" of that teacher who used the analogy of birds to "comfort" or ridicule me...</p>
<h3>Autumn Rain</h3>
<p>— Er He</p>
<p>Rain, rain, yes, it's raining softly outside the window at this moment…, friend: perhaps you live in the city, perhaps you live in the countryside, but this doesn't matter, in any case, you should also be experiencing the rain. In the countryside, perhaps you are in a small house built of mud, or perhaps in a simple house covered with straw? In the city, then perhaps you are in a narrow, cluttered garret, or perhaps in a spacious and magnificent skyscraper? Perhaps you are frowning, biting your fingers, lamenting the soft rain, but the soft rain does not stop because of your lament, it deliberately goes against you, just falling gently, falling…. Friend, how are you? Can you bear this heavy, oppressive melancholy? I know you will hate it, or perhaps you simply light a cigarette, watching the thick white smoke curl from your nostrils, but unfortunately, perhaps the smoke makes you sink into old dreams. Perhaps old wounds are discovered, perhaps many faded stories are dancing before your eyes, perhaps a strong sadness is brewing. Yes, I know, you will drink, because drinking can dispel sorrow. But in reality, you will prove yourself deceived. The flood of sorrow comes even more fiercely. Perhaps you will unintentionally hum ancient verses: "Wine enters the sorrowful intestines, each drop turns into tears of longing." But, it is equally unhelpful. Friend: How are you? You should look at the soft rain outside the window again…, but this time, I know you are not frowning or biting your fingers, because you have no anxiety, let alone any strength. You are just silent, you are overwhelmed by endless thoughts.</p>
<p>Then dusk comes. On banana leaves, on paulownia leaves, the sound of rain is like the sound of insects, rustling. How are you, friend: perhaps you inadvertently recite the verses you used to know by heart: "Three or two banana trees outside the curtain, what can one do late at night?"! "Paulownia trees and fine rain, dripping until dusk, how can this state be described with just one word of sorrow?" But what can you do, friend, perhaps you open the door and look outside, but the courtyard is dark and gloomy, only the rustling rain occasionally falls on your sleeves. What to do, friend: I know you are silent. Retreat to the bed, still quietly fall asleep, you close your eyes, expecting colorful dreams, but before long, you seem to feel that you must open your eyes. When your eyes open, you think, it's late at night, go back to sleep, so you turn your body to the side, banishing all thoughts from your mind, but your mind doesn't listen, it insists on thinking, so you wish you could smash your head, so you simply get up, walk to the table, wanting to write a few lovely verses or lyrics, perhaps you succeed, perhaps you don't. Then you think about trying to sleep again, but then many things come to mind again, perhaps thinking about someone you just parted with, perhaps thinking about many years ago,… thinking, thinking, friend: can you sleep again? You murmur, "Thin quilt, small pillow, cool weather, suddenly feel the taste of parting. Toss and turn, counting the cold watches, getting up and going back to sleep. After all, can't sleep, one night is as long as a year." You must think this is your own writing. Perhaps you drank too much, perhaps you are really too sentimental, you cry, sobbing, like a child with a grievance with nowhere to vent. You murmur, "Tonight the dim lamp shines obliquely, still, after the autumn rain clears, the tears don't clear." You simply don't want to sleep anymore. You wait for the fresh sunshine of tomorrow.</p>
<p>Dawn comes, but it is still softly raining…. You will weakly murmur, "Tears before the pillow, rain before the steps, dripping until dawn across the window." But you are too tired after all, you are like a dying cold butterfly without a shred of strength, you lie down, you finally stop. In your dream, you may still be sad. Friend: You have probably tasted enough of the autumn rain, right? At this moment, you are already snoring, along with the soft sound of rain outside the window.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "The Fate of Tears and Laughter - Flogging Fengxi"</p>
<p>The general's angry eyes are wide open, his hand wielding a rattan whip, walking upstairs. I don't care about you. Last night, I went to heaven on business. You actually secretly left the house. Ah, you lowly person. Crack a whip. Utter a curse. His hand waves, his eyes follow, not stopping. I saw her snow-white skin and cloud-like hair in disarray. Her clothes are disheveled, revealing her chest. Fengxi hears. Trembling. Her body is covered in fragrant sweat. There are ears on the other side of the wall, beware of being noticed. How could there be no eavesdroppers outside the window? Who knew that the angry general heard this and sneered two or three times. I understand everything in your heart. Could it be that you are continuing your old relationship with a secret lover? I think you, living in a humble alley, are lowly. Singing and playing clappers for a living. Now you haven't changed your usual ways. I'm just afraid that the fox's tail will still be revealed. I thought you had changed your ways and disguised yourself as a scholar. Becoming a respectable female student. Coming here, enjoying wealth and luxury. Wearing fine clothes and eating jade delicacies, happy. Who knows that you have a born seductive nature. Can't hide, the fleeting affair. You actually gave me a green hat in secret. Wormwood is not a noble plant. Only comparable to roadside willows and wall flowers, wild grass. How can a sparrow become a phoenix? Of course, you are not worthy of being a madam.</p>
<p>Na Ruiting's Three Smiles</p>
<p>Lin Ji (1220) 9:05 PM to 10:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening Chapter "The Pipa of Xunyang"</p>
<p>Sima Xiangshan went down to Jiangzhou. Anchoring at the ancient head of Xunyang Bo at night. Saying goodbye sadly together. Reed flowers and maple leaves in the late autumn Jiang. Thinking of myself, I am sadly exiled like duckweed. Seeing off the boat sailing on the water. Looking at the moon on the Jiang water, it is already the second watch, the watchtower sounding. Suddenly hearing the mournful sound of strings starting, asking where the sadness is like a complaint. Therefore, the host and guests approached a neighboring boat. Calling her to move her boat to meet with half shyness. Seeing that the old Qiuniang is still charming. Adding a cup of wine to the table. Only listening to her, narrating her life's glory and old dreams. But unfortunately, spring flowers and autumn eyes cannot stay. The bronze strings are pressed, the silver nails are adjusted. Who knows that the mandarin duck curtain is empty, longing for the jade hook. Past events are unbearable to look back on. Unspeakable, several times the whole story from the beginning. Seeing her, the remaining rouge and powder are in vain regret. The blood-stained pomegranate skirt. Later, the carriages and horses gradually became scarce, sad and cold. How could I marry a husband from Fuliang? Like the palace fan discarded by the autumn wind. The missing moon is difficult to invite the jade axe to repair. Know that since ancient times, the entertainment venue is the same as the officialdom. Cang Sang changes easily and leisurely. I am also the same lost visitor in the world. Knowing each other at the end of the road, tears in both eyes. However, the pipa on the river has thousands of years of hate. I persuade you to play another song. Just because I have nothing to give you, so I make a new song. Waiting for the song to end and the wine to run out, people leave. Hearing the sound of the horses returning. Feeling that, the red face and green shirt shed tears.</p>

<p>Yuan Chang (1120) Midnight 0:45 AM to 1:30 AM</p>
<p>Opening Chapter "Spring Boudoir Complaint Lyrics" (Mimi Collection Creation Issue)</p>
<p>Curved railing, curved wall. Winding through the corridor. Walking through the fragrant path. A burst of wind brings a burst of fragrance. Butterflies fluttering. Swallows in pairs. Branches and leaves casting shadows of willows. But seeing that the peach blossoms are bright like brocade. Willow catkins are fluttering and dancing. And hearing the sound of iron horses rattling, startling the larks and drums. The curtain hook is not seen rolling up heavily. The curl of incense is faint and fragrant. Thinking of Nu Nu, I am day and night haunted by old hatred. Tired and lazy to embroider mandarin ducks. Jade comb does not care for silky hair. Precious mirror is lazy to apply light makeup. All day long, sitting alone in the boudoir, the sound is quiet. Aroused, lying listlessly on the bed. Then call, add firewood to the stove. The maid is busy preparing medicine. But listening, the wind and rain are heavy outside, the lonely lamp is dim, the night is long. Can not help him, the heart is right and wrong to think. Whispering to oneself. I remember, my Qingqing had it before. Only hope to accompany Xiao Lang day and night. Unexpectedly, the wind and waves rose in the vast sea of love. I was harmed, a lonely shadow alone. I am inch by inch, the sun is broken inch by inch. Miss you, tears streaming down. From now on, the road is long, I can't wait for news. Tears are breaking my heart. I feel, bitter rain is miserable and lonely. The sorrowful wind is cold and sad. Only the lamp remains, throwing red beans. Quietly, the silk is faded. Poor me, I hate my life is thin. Tears wet the silk robe. Try to see, the green grass in front of the court is over the years. I only hate that the threads of love are not long. The dream is vague, familiar with the yellow millet.</p>
