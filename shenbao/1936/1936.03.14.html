<h3 id="c14">倫敦會議之展望 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 隅</p>
<p>國聯行政理事會與羅卡諾條的簽字國會議由日內瓦遷至倫敦作爲國聯支柱與羅卡諾條約重要擔保人的英國在這一决會議中無疑的將成爲一個重要角色我們又將見唐寗街的保守黨外交家爲他們日夜拿來號召的集體安全而努力了歐洲的陰霾正如倫敦的霧一樣濃厚我們在未問英國外交家能否有撥開雲霧而見靑天的手段以前我們且先問在保守死硬派支配下的英國是吾能爲一個不偏不倚的居間者</p>
<p>自然我們不該先懷疑英國和平天使們的誠意但我們一分析過去英國的外交我們却又在英國和平天使們的慈善面目上隱隱看出一副狡詐的神情掩藏在裏面</p>
<p>有些政論家如英國新聞界的權威史蒂德等總認爲英國近來的外交家缺乏遠大的眼光因而他們的外交政策也缺乏一貫的中心時常變換不定以致對於世界和平種下了許多惡果他首先舉出一九三一年「滿洲事件」時英國的外交失策那時的英國政治家爲卸却「集體安全的責任」不嚴守「國聯盟的」「凱洛公的」和「九國公的」的規定結果使遠東問題與軍縮會議一無成就這是一件又如一九三三年初中歐各國大有團結的希望那時波蘭與蘇俄的邦交頗趨親善同時波蘭還正想與捷克訂立永久親善條的而變爲小協的的一環可是剛當時機成熟的時候英國前首相麥唐納與前外相西門忽被德國「納粹」黨釣上了鈎乘飛機至羅馬與墨索里尼成立四强協定麥氏在下院演說主張修改和的而以取消波蘭走廊爲其第一步波蘭畢爾蘇斯基將軍失望之餘一反其以往政策而與德國自動談判成立德波協定而捷波永久親善遂吿流產這是第二件又如一九三五年六月英德成立海軍協定德國地位突然升高德國巡洋艦東巡示威遠達芬蘭灣畔而「納粹黨人如羅森培之徒亦大有磨拳擦掌一試身手於波羅的海之勢這樣一來法國因英國的親德而更接近意大利意大利的敢於在東菲用兵照史蒂德的意見英國保守黨的短視外交實不能辭其咎這是第三件</p>
<p>史蒂德以上的見地大部分我們是認爲對的但史氏只討論其影響而沒有探討保守黨政策所以如此的原因謂保守黨政治目光患短視事實可不如此單純我們知道代表地主貴族資本家的保守黨我們决不能忘記掉他們在本質上是對於現在作爲歐洲集體安全重心而與法國親善的蘇聯十分憎恨的法國與蘇俄有親善協定的締結法英的關係疏而法蘇的關係密這雖是英國自食其果然而英國究不願這樣協定出現於歐洲無論英國外交家口頭上如何擁誕集體安全自然法蘇協定是集體安全的一種事實表現與保守黨的所謂集體安全廣義地講並無二致如果保守黨眞致力於集體安全則擁護之不暇遑論反對可是我們要知道保守黨所謂集體安全與蘇聯大有實質上的不同他們所謂集體的安全並不是所謂「不可分裂的和平」乃是「戰爭區域化」之別名申言之就是英國的集體安全只要不在萊茵河以西發生戰爭就够了萊茵河以東假使有戰事發生英國自可不問因此英國之所謂集體安全者乃使德國不西犯的意義而不是保全整個歐州或整個世界和平的意義</p>
<p>以上的觀察如果不離事實十分遠的話那末我們就可以明白英國以往爲什麽只努力於西歐天空公約的簽訂而對於東歐公的漢不關心了爲什麼不顧列强的反對而與德國單獨訂立海軍協定了爲什麼德國宣言廢除羅卡諾條的法國及其他有關係國家皇皇不可終日而英國却若無其事的了我們拿過去的事來作爲例證以推測將來我們可以推測這决倫敦會議中英國唐寗街的要角並不是怎樣不偏不倚的居間者在倫敦會議尙未開幕以前我們已聽到英國不主張對德制裁而主張由羅卡諾各關係國與德談話的消息今日的英國已不是法國戰前的老伴她决不會像法國所希望於她那樣再作羅卡諾條的的有力支柱英國希望德國萊茵河駐軍撤退一部分並在該河沿岸不設防禦工事不過僅是希望而已以法國態度的强硬德國的堅持英國的狡滑意國的待價而估倫敦會議的成果恐怕也要像其他歐洲會議一樣一無成就不歡而散的</p>

<p>— 杏邨</p>
<p>影饗昆蟲發生之因子昆蟲之發生</p>
<p>，恒受環境因子的限制，有人說：影響</p>
<p>昆蠱發生的因子，是屬於氣候方面的，</p>
<p>這一般入認昆蟲在某一時期發生數目的</p>
<p>多寡，完全根據氣侯之是吾適宜，又有</p>
<p>人說：限制昆虫發生的因子是屬生物方</p>
<p>面的，卽昆蟲發生數目的多少，完全要</p>
<p>看天然敵害的多少，所謂天然敵害，包</p>
<p>括有益鳥，益蟲和有益動物，他們都是</p>
<p>以害蟲作食料的；談到生物因子，我們</p>
<p>便想到自然界裹，有一種「自然平衡」現</p>
<p>象，卽自然界對於一種動物，常維持其</p>
<p>一定數目，使一致突然增多，例如，往</p>
<p>往有一種害蟲，在其原產地，因有寄生</p>
<p>昆蟲或其他天敵的限制，致能維持自然</p>
<p>平衡，而不至爲大害，設一旦離開其原</p>
<p>產地，而遷入別的所在，則新的環境裏</p>
<p>，因缺乏天然敵害，而不能維持自然平</p>
<p>衡，結果，個體數目激增，而爲大患，</p>
<p>近代經濟昆蟲學家，盛倡生物學的害蟲</p>
<p>防治法，卽運用此種法則，實行以蟲制</p>
<p>蟲，往往從極遠的地方，引進害蟲的天</p>
<p>敵，以殲殺害蟲，世界各國之除蟲事業</p>
<p>，也有從道方面獲得相當成効的。</p>
<p>蝗蟲發生之週期性蝗蟲爲我國農</p>
<p>作物上重要害蟲之一，但並非連年爲害</p>
<p>，必相隔數年，始爲患一决，所以蝗蟲</p>
<p>發生是有週期性的。見蟲學家對於這種</p>
<p>現象，有一種解釋，卽蝗蟲可以分爲羣</p>
<p>居形和獨居形兩類，這兩類不獨在形態</p>
<p>上顯然不同，卽習性亦各有異，羣居形</p>
<p>可以成羣遠徙，而爲大害，這便是所謂</p>
<p>「飛蝗蔽天」的飛蝗，食害農作物的，全</p>
<p>屬於這一類。獨居形的蝗蟲多各自散居</p>
<p>，無須成羣遠徙，故不致成災，其實羣</p>
<p>居形和獨居形是可以交互變化的，當環</p>
<p>境適宜，食料充足的時侯，獨居形可以</p>
<p>變爲羣居形，反之，當環境不適，和食</p>
<p>料缺乏的時候，羣居也可變爲獨居形，</p>
<p>所以蝗蟲不爲大害之年，並非該時期內</p>
<p>根本沒有蝗蟲存在，不過當時獨居形的</p>
<p>蝗蟲，沒有變成羣居形的飛蝗罷了。</p>
<p>害蟲發生之預測在害蟲防治法上</p>
<p>，有一種理想的而尙未達完全成功的方</p>
<p>法，卽設法把害蟲的發生，預先推測出</p>
<p>來，好像氣象台預示風雨一樣，這樣對</p>
<p>於害蟲，便可預先防範，而收事半功倍</p>
<p>之效。然而，實際預測害蟲發生，沒有</p>
<p>預測氣候那樣簡單，因爲影饗昆蟲發生</p>
<p>的，除氣候的因子外，還有生物的因子</p>
<p>，氣候因子中又包括有溫度，雨量等等</p>
<p>，所以昆蟲學家在這一方面，雖具有甚</p>
<p>大的願望，却還沒有達到完全成功的境</p>
<p>地。我們如果要藉氣象的記載，以推測</p>
<p>一種害蟲的發生，首先要明瞭害蟲發生</p>
<p>地的平均溫度，及平均濕度，或平均雨</p>
<p>量。（爲月的平均，或年的平均視需要</p>
<p>而定。）據蔡邦華先生的研究，三化螟</p>
<p>蟲，（三化螟蟲爲我國產稻區域裏之一</p>
<p>種重要害蟲，其幼蟲時期，專門鑽在稻</p>
<p>幹裏，囓食水稻莖內的組織，致成枯心</p>
<p>苗，和白穗等，極難加以驅除）。在杭</p>
<p>州莧橋地方，如果第一年八九月裏的氣</p>
<p>候是溫度高而雨量多，則第二年所生三</p>
<p>化螟蟲個體的數目，一定很多，其爲害</p>
<p>水稻的稈度，也一定很高，原因是在八</p>
<p>九月裹溫度高和雨量多的氣候，極適於</p>
<p>三化螟蟲的繁殖，所以平時三化螟蟲在</p>
<p>杭州莧橋地方僅發生三次的，一遇有這</p>
<p>種氣候，便可以增加至四决，旣然多發</p>
<p>生了一决，則越冬幼蟲的數目也隨之加</p>
<p>多，因此第二年該地三化螟蟲便呈大發</p>
<p>生現象，而猖獗起來了。所以我們如果</p>
<p>要預測第二年之三化螟蟲發生情形，可</p>
<p>將前一年每月所記載的平均溫度和平均</p>
<p>雨量，造成一種氣候圖，和已往之三化</p>
<p>螟發生正常年度（卽三化螟蟲不猖獗之</p>
<p>年度）的氣候圖相比較，便不難推測而</p>
<p>知了。</p>

<p>— 荘學本</p>
<p>李克用後代關於我們這一位主人李土司的歷史，值得單獨空出一面替他叙述</p>
<p>他的始祖爲唐憲宗時西域沙陀部落的酋長朱邪執宜。隆唐後，其子平龐動有功。賜名李國昌，使大同節度使，生子克用，滅黃巢，封晋王。有子十三人：俗稱十三太保。子存勗滅朱梁，爲後唐莊宗。嗣源爲後唐明宗。宋時其裔繼恭繼捧爲節度使。元時李賞哥爲岐王府。子梅的古管吉祿分茅土於紅崖溝北川士官莊。瞥吉祿子南哥。元爲西寗州同知。明進指揮僉事，追贈會寗伯。生一子：李英，李雄。李英因戰功，進光祿大夫柱國會寗伯。子孫世襲稱東伯府，住碾伯縣東南一百二十里的上川口，李雄進榮祿大夫柱國高陽伯。亦世襲，稱西伯府，住西寗縣南三十里之乞塔城，都有土地人民管轄，手下有千把總二十三名，外副額二十三名，土兵三百名，淸朝順治二年，東伯府李珍，西伯府李天愈，同時歸順，授指揮同知職。</p>
<p>李土司承襄他是東伯府的一支，所以他現在的卡片上，還印着「碾伯南襲土司指揮同知」的一行銜頭。他在前淸時，土司衙門的組織，有千總一名，把總二名，外衛四名，千戶一百，百戶二名，土兵三百名。土兵是屯兵制，完令寓兵於農。民國以來，改士歸流，土司失去？他的權位；但是民至今還有尊敬當差的遺傳性，他們過去西伯府的土司名李沛霖，現在住西寗　。</p>
<p>到桑思格以後，第一件感覺　樣的男女衣飾又別緻了。</p>
<p>婦女的頭飾男子的衣飾差別還少，他們穿的無面的皮襖，束腰，羔皮帽，軟　靴，有的　間掛一把火罐。但是每一個土人多還拖着一條長辮。</p>
<p>女子的服飾普通是褐子衣在這幾夫新年中，多穿上一件五色袖管的新衣：外衣是一件黑色的長袍，袖子用二寸的紅布條，黃布條，藍布條，紫布條，綠布條，縫成二個美麗的袖管，有錢的外罩一件綠色綢緞，或黑色絲絨的短背心，前後的衣角上鑲四個大如意。頸中掛二串紅白相間的細料珠耳環下垂及肩，鞋子雙樑，用紅黃綠布一條一條的製成。未嫁的女子禿頭梳兩條辮子。已嫁的婦女戴二種頭飾：一種三叉頭，種乾糧頭。</p>
<p>「三叉頭」又名「尖尖頭」，於腦後覆一Shagol。連綴着三寸長的銅管二三十根，用紅繩紮成橢圓形，上挿銅箭一支；聳起頂上約半尺高，箭頭分三叉，上掛小紅絨球二枚。辮上懸紅繩數轉，背又拖一個圓徑半尺的（he　ga，斜聳背上，爲紅紙版製成，正而用細如米粒的五色料珠，列成九色圓圈，外邊又鑲白色小海螺一轉。「乾糧頭」又名「燒餅頭」，在　辦上挿一圓形如燒餅之紅紙版，土名Tokuila。邊上釘紅繩，下垂。纓絡，背後用　色花邊綢襯托。其背上亦拖一聳起之Chelga</p>
<p>此類頭飾與塘巴堡截然不同，夏日男子之衣料爲褐，女子穿布。</p>
<p>此地土人染漢化未深。險貌溝秀，舉動大眞。女子的身體矮小，男子的身體壯健。他們都還沒有見過照相，所以當我替他們照相時，姿勢多很活潑自然。有幾個略知淸潔的土女，在她們已經洗掉垢膩的臉上，擦上一種紅色如胭脂的倫。更顯得蘋果色的臉蛋，康佛而美　。</p>
<p>風於也很　繼，左　靠的山，有　臨　溝，沿着大路和溝岸全是齊整苗條的白楊，路口的轉角，翼然的彭康，使人有置身園林的感想。紅崖子溝現在凍着厚冰，一排五六個水磨，點綴着偉大的河溝：軋軋的機聲，和旋轉不息的輪轂，很會引動游人的詩意。旭日初升，和夕陽將下的時候，穿五色衣的女子，趕着一羣羊子，帶着幾個牲口，在樹林中穿了出來，在河邊上呀許、呀許！的叫牛羊飲水，金波搖動，重父翩然返進樹林，一排背着水桶的婦女，吱吱喳喳談笑着隨後在河邊出現，陽光照着她們的帽冠，姗姗的來往不斷，直到日上三竿，或新月在林，她們的影子也隨着隱滅。</p>
<p>一元一畝田</p>
<p>土人的生活到處是女勤男惰，這幾天新年中男子更一些不做事，終日在莊院中閑達。婦女雖然也應該休息享樂，但是背水，背糞土，放羊，拾牛糞，終日奔波，仍是忙個不息，</p>
<p>這裏土風純粹些；所以他們背水也和西番一樣。用一隻高高桶縛兩根繩子，繩子套在左右肩上，水桶穩穩的站在後背。</p>
<p>他們的住處也有雙層的樓房。</p>
<p>經濟都很拮据，現金流通的更少，小康的土人家裏拿得出十塊大洋的很少，他們向喇嘛借僓利息高至五分。</p>
<p>地勢高二八四○公尺，在山谷中間地氣比較溫暖，莊稼在淸明後就可以種。全莊居民共三十家，漢人有十分之一，也多是種幾斗莊稼，養幾個羊子。</p>
<p>他們多是自耕自給，物價所以很低；田每畝一元，最高亦不過六元，馬二十至一百元。騾一百元左右，牛十至二十元。羊二元。猪六元，靑菓每斗一元。麥子每斗一元五角。豆每斗二元。</p>
<p>七歲就結婚</p>
<p>婚嫁的風俗在此地比蛟自由些，普通男女兩情相悅，致財禮，拜天地，即可式成爲夫婦，</p>
<p>但是通行的還是專制婚姻。小康之家流行小夫大婦制，往往七八歲的小孩，娶上一個二十歲的媳婦。因爲土人娣女勤勞操作，男子閑逸不事生產，小夫大婦制的目的，不在生男育女，而在帮助夫家操理農事。這一種媳婦過門時，不拜堂。惟由男家納財禮。</p>
<p>財禮在正式結婚前先送到女家，馬一匹，牛一頭，犏牛一頭，褐子十拓，布十六個，錢八十釧。視男家的貧富，財禮略有增减。</p>
<p>迎娶，由喇嘛擇吉日，接新婦過門。人廚下，戴乾糧頭或二叉頭，夫婦拜堂，親戚圍坐院中飲酒道喇。</p>
<p>他們婚姻的締結，血統及畏幼輩都不問，近親是不許的。寡婦再　也很平常。漢土通婚的很少，有的，祗有土人娶漢人。</p>
<p>因爲女家需索的財禮很重，所以貧困的男人，一輩子沒有妻子的很多。女子因此也不能嫁出去，而終老於母家的也很多。曠夫怨女，性的須要在所不能免，因爲他們性的問題恨公開，所以倆倆私奔的事情也就很减少。</p>
<p>十五做阿姑</p>
<p>未嫁的女子到了十五歲，向父母天地跪拜　頭，將背後兩根髪辦的尾梢，連起來，就稱「戴天頭。男此後她們被人艷稱爲「阿姑</p>
<p>「阿姑」的戀愛就能享到自由的權利，父母兄弟都不能顧問，她反正還在母家操作。阿姑在外面找情人，或者帶了情人回家，都很自由。如故她帶了一個有聲望的男子回家，她的父母兄弟還願意帮她招待。阿姑生了子女，就算母家的子女，姓母家的姓，阿姑就終老於母家。阿姑的情人致了財禮，把她接過去了，她所生的子女，願意帶過去，不願意帶過去，都很隨便，不帶過去的子女，就作爲娘家的後裔。</p>
<p>也有少數的阿姑，她們因爲情人太多，她陷在情海中不能自拔，她就帶了　　頭，住在母家，以便應付。所以土人儘有不　不嫁的曠夫怨女，而事實上多數是不曠不　的。</p>
<p>據說他們土人的淫亂風氣，因爲前面樂都縣有兩個山，中間流出一條水，太像女子的陰部，所以把他們的風水破壞了。</p>
<p>男子定了媳婦，他將財禮送過去，女家接受了：他的情人就替他製一塊綢領子，上面用紅綠絲綫紫銅絲繡成美麗的花紋，裝在她未婚夫的褐子衣上，表示她定情的一種禮物。所以要知道靑年男子訂婚沒有，祇要看他頸中有沒有花領。</p>

<p>— 中國徵信主編（上海工商業概况之十七）</p>
<p>經手費及交易方法交易所對於經紀人之徵收佣金。名曰經手費。其徵收標準。依照交易實在金額計算。每萬元抽取六元二角五分。而經紀人對於客戶則倍收之。唯各家環境不同。多數未能一致。大概以千分之一爲普遍標凖。近且降至萬分之七八矣。一而銀行交易。更有僅納六二五凈盤者。蓋在經紀人方面。亦另有懷抱也。</p>

<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>「三八」，是國際婦女節，是婦女掙脫枷鎖，爭取獨立的人格的紀念日。自然，婦女解放運動，到現在，還不過是在長距離而崎嶇的道路上，遲緩地行進着，距離目的地，還正遠得不可以道里計，更其是我們這個受桎梏最有悠久歷史的中國婦女界，更顯得解放運動的幼稚。所以這個「三八節」，無疑地，僅僅是一個婦女運動的第一個小爆竹，所發出的一個微弱的火花而已。</p>
<p>「三八節」，雖不過是一星小小的火花，但這一星小小的火花中，却含有二重偉大的意義：第一重，是從桎梏中，獲取解放：第二重，是旣被解放之後的平等地位的獲取。</p>
<p>「婦女解放」在中國，這些年來，顯然是在局部的畸形發展着，似乎是僅限於極少數的幾個大都市的學生界中。大都市的學生界中，最低的限度，總是有抨擊不合理的壓迫婦女的一切的自由。但是無疑地，一經跨出了學校，或是在假期中，回進家庭的時期中，一大半便不由自主的將相當的不能自由地，為解放運動努力。為的是社會與家庭的環境，還是具備着受有相當敎育的婦女，所不能摧毁的堅强的壁壘，在在都安置着幽囚婦女的陷阱與牢鎖，張着嘴，準備吞噬婦女。——不分未被解放，或已被解放的婦女。</p>
<p>就是已被解放的少數婦女，跨進了社會，要求一個與男子站在平等地位的解放之後的歸宿，也還儘顯着後顧茫茫的形勢。所能見到的，只是一團可怖的暗影而已。關於這一層，自然不能不歸咎於歷史，因為我們這個社會，便是相傳數千年的男性吞噬女性的社會呀。但是男性吞噬女性，這是富有歷史的一個已成事實，而婦女運動所需的心理建設，也正是推翻這個已成事實的努力。但是已往的婦女運動，截至目前為止，顯然地，僅努力於婦女的不澈底而不普遍的解放。至於聊勝於無的解放之後，該如何？曾否建設着相當的地位，以容納鳳毛麟角的解放婦女？是沒入加以過問的。因此，在少數的解放婦女中的大半，從舊的桎梏中，掙扎了出來，便不自知的墮落到了新的陷阱中去。雖然這是社會的不良，但是在事實上，婦女解放運動的近視政策。也是不能不負責任的。</p>
<p>作者有一表妹，從頑固的父母手中，從女子無才便是德的環境中，爭得了受高深敎育的權利。在求學時代，又爭得了婚姻自主權，而和十三歲上由父母作主而許配着的低能的未婚夫，解除了婚的。雖然因此而和家庭發生了嚴重的衝突，幷受到舊社會的嚴厲制裁的痛苦，伊倒都能以堅靱不拔的勇氣，去奮鬥。但是過了不多時，伊因家庭的經濟關係已絕，只得上社會服務豈知於前年，竟被愚失身，而為姨太太。待到揭穿秘密，涉訟法庭，而脫難關係之後，伊已是被擯於父母，宗族的一個女子了。在目前，伊雖藉着離婚時的一點贍養費，繼續入校肄業，但是伊的前途，自然還是找不到可以樂觀的光明。</p>
<p>自然，不過是舉一個例而已。這些年來，像這一類的事伴，在婦女運動的進行中，已不知發生了多少，因此我希望大家紀念「三八節」，認識了第一重意義之外，更須注意着第二重意義。吾則，「婦女運動」在中國，是會得到意外的失敗，而致全功盡棄的。</p>
<h3 id="c197">尊敬你的妻子愛護你的孩子 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 陳學昭譯</p>
<p>我國資產階級的消滅牽帶了資產階級結婚形式的消滅。</p>
<p>雖然，如要說在我國家庭的關係方面什麼都是完善的，所有的家庭，所有的獨身男女靑年的關係之間都是和平的，這話未免太虛假。事實眞不是如此。我們給了婦女以各種權利，我們給伊們開了一條工作的路，一條獨立生活的路，但是我們還沒有去掉資本社會的殘留的壓迫。這個可惡的壓迫老是在蘇維埃國的家庭關係里感覺到。</p>
<p>這些資產階級的殘留，舉一個例，便是有發個人的對於他們家庭義務的不負責，不思索的態度。</p>
<p>人民中道德最不固定的份子以為十月革命所給於男子而也給於婦女的最大的自由，是表示在家庭生活里有可做不肖事情的權利。這樣的份子，在我們人口中雖只占極小的一部分，可是他們的數目還是太多，因為他們做的壞事，並不受罰。</p>
<p>有自覺的無產階級者們對於他們的家庭，對於他們該負的義務，不管對於妻，對於父母都有尊崇的表示。只有資產階級的神父與寵壞的兒子，他們自己明白是家庭里的不良份子，但仍保守着他們的舊習慣。要說一想到家庭就有小資產階級的思想，這只為虛偽的資產階級的白相客是這樣的。</p>
<p>做一個家庭里的好份子，就是完成一個我們該完成的責任。一個家庭里的惡劣份子不會是一個好的蘇維埃公民，也不會是一個社會計劃裏的好工人。</p>
<p>雖然在我國，女子具有法律上的平等與經濟上的獨立，但是伊還是弱的一部份，直到社會能盡所有兒童敎育的時候：我們應該保護伊，因為大部分忽略家庭責任的人總是男子。</p>
<p>在我國，誰都不必勉强繼續他的結婚生活。我們沒有醜惡的離婚案子。但是蘇維埃法律所給予的離婚的權利，並不是不道德的權利。我們的法律假定男子與女子自己知道他們的責任。但是男子的責任是更大。一個沒有孩子的家庭失却了它的意義，而兒童的敎育需要許多的工作與留心。這個工作恰恰應該父母合任，兒童衣食津貼的法律應該絕對執行。一個拋棄了妻子及子女而自己感覺自由得像一隻烏似的父親是二個罪犯。那些寬容對付只想逃脫他們責任的這些父親們的法庭也是犯罪的。</p>
<p>社會主義要使它的保護達到各個人而人口能增加起來。我們的靑年是世界上最健全的靑年，無論在體格與精神方面。他的性格在不斷的為社會主義而戰鬥里已漸决依照了進化的思想重新敎育過。這種思想與情慾過度及卑視婦女一點不相關。資產階級的殘留將完全剷除。</p>
<p>這是我們的制度不同之處，敎養他的子女，尊敬他的妻子與母親，是蘇維埃人民的光榮。</p>
<p>近來我國頗有人倡新賢母良妻，賢母良妻，當然是我們所需要的，但是單有賢母良妻而沒有賢夫良父，也還是沒有用處的。這篇俄國報紙上的短文里極力倡賢夫良父，我覺得還有意思，便把它譯了出來。——譯者。</p>
<p>育兒房</p>
<h3 id="c198">對於胎敎的認識 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 久庸</p>
<p>現在很有些敎育家，主張人的全生產敎育，除了家庭敎育，學校敎育和社會的敎育以外，還有所謂母胎期敎育，而且以為它非常重要，這也許是他們根據了人類的發育，當胎兒在母體的子宮內，取得母體的營養和保護而生活，以為母體的身心，足以影響於胎兒，胎敎也便在這「假設一之下而成立了，東西各國也都如此承認着。</p>
<p>在我國，如朱子在他的小學內篇立敎中，也有如是叙述：「列女傳曰：古，婦人姙子，寢不側，坐不邊，立不蹕，不食邪味，割不正不食，席不正不坐，目不視邪色，耳不聽淫聲，夜則瞽而誦詩，道正事，如斯，則生子形容端正，才過人」，這便是說明了母在姙娠之中，注意日常生活的規範。</p>
<p>就是在我國民間，也有諸如此類的傳說和故事，但帶着十二分迷信性。</p>
<p>至於胎敎的敎育價値，我們不問其效果怎樣，但是有這樣的注意胎兒的母親，才是眞正敎育他的兒子，從敎育上來看，我們所期待於母所及的敎育的感化，實在比胎敎本身的價値為大，再就科學的價値來看，我們根據今日的科學知識來說明：</p>
<p>母體的慢性的急性的疾病，是有害於胎兒的。</p>
<p>母體的長久憂慮，情緒抑鬱，怠惰過勞，害於母體的營養，直接是有害於胎兒的身體發育。</p>
<p>母體攝取毒藥和毒物，是能破壞生殖細胞，而致影響於胎兒的身心。</p>
<p>黴毒傳染於胎內，也能傷及胎兒的發育的。</p>
<p>由此看來，母體在姙娠時，伊需要着如何的攝生，便可以想知了。朱子的叙述，確實地很符合科學的見地的。</p>
<p>可是醫學者，却不承認這些，除了能影響胎兒身體的機制外，母體和胎兒的關係，母體只不過給血液來供胎兒。而因為母體營養障碍，中毒和病害，雖因血液傳給胎兒，而這種惡影響，是不發見的，他們以為如共怕不注意胎敎的母親，倒不如對於生後的精神敎育，耍注意些才是。</p>
<p>在我們的認識，今後的胎敎，應該根據遺傳的指示，優生學的敎訓，注意理想的配偶條件，姙娠時的衛生，對於產生優良素質的生兒，更應加以注意。</p>

<h3 id="c199">記黃克强夫人 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 林蒨</p>
<p>革命先烈黃克强氏，在我國民族革命的光榮歷史中，他有着極大的功績。他的夫人許宗漢女士，也是一位巾幗中的英傑。在黃氏故世後，力繼伊丈夫的志向，時和北政府的惡勢力相鬥。急公好義，好像是伊生成的性格，凡是有什麼救國運動，總是盡伊的力量相助的。記得民國八年，五四運動的時候，各地方都有學生會成立，伊便在上海組織女界聯合會，再從女界聯合會倡首，組織全國各界聯合會，眞的是登高一呼，萬山饗應，各省各地的工商學等團體，都推派了代表參加，那時喚起民衆，而致有這樣民氣振盛的現象，伊自然有相當的功勞在內。幷且當上海民衆和軍閥奮鬥時，伊總是擔任前鋒，時常率領了女同志們，向軍警隊伍中衝過去，軍警反而被伊們衝退，而男同志們往往因之而獲得安全。自從革命軍建都南京，伊見革命已吿成功，可仍不願享淸福，便創立了貧兒敎養院，專以敎養一般貧苦的子弟，數年以來，得伊培植的，何止千人。院中的設備很完善，主要的功課，是關於工藝職業的敎導，如無綫電，打字，縫紉，織毛巾洋襪，以及籐品等種種，使得學生們畢業後，都能自謀生活。每年畢業的學生，照章自然是應該離院，但是學生們因為沒有經濟上獨立的能力，所以多仍不肯出院，伊明白學生們的苦衷，便儘力地替他們謀出路，推荐到各公私工廠裏去，然而日久人多，推荐也漸漸地困難了，所以一到了畢業時期，就成了伊的大難關。為了畢業學生們的出路，常累得伊寢食俱廢，卽此可見伊的一番為大衆服務的苦心了。倘然國內各個偉人的夫人，都和這位黃夫人一樣，不但是全國貧兒得了救星，中國也早就得救了。</p>

<p>素火腿火腿，任何人總知道是用猪腿作的，怎說是素的呢？但是我所說的這素火腿，是用豆腐皮子作的。先用十張或二十張豆腐皮子，浸在好醬油裏，滲上蝦子，大的浸到一個鐘頭，就取出來，一張張的疊好再把蝦子和醬油都滲和在皮子里面，然後捲起來，和銀圓那樣大小的一個長條子，再用乾凈布包紮好，外面更用繩子捆上，越緊越好。紮好了，就放在粗碗裹隔水煮，大的煮上兩個鐘點，可以取出，用刀切成銀圓大小厚薄的塊子，非常可口。如果拿它下粥，允為合宜。</p>
<p>糖山芋　用本山芋，（紅皮紅心的如果沒有本山芋，洋山芋也行。）去掉皮，切成圓形塊子，用豆油煮黃，（要一塊一塊的煎，纔能煎透。）再攙水，白糖，猪油同煮，煮一兩個鐘點，卽可煮爛，食之甜蜜可口，作為午點允佳。</p>
<p>肉鬆　用猪肉數斤，去皮，去肥，只留精肉，（卽瘦肉）洗凈，加入醬油，酒，葱薑等，照紅燒猪肉法燒好，再用筷將肉絲搗碎，再煮，俟湯將乾時，仍以筷攪和。候湯煮乾，加入蔴油，再用剷子炒，約炒一二小時，卽可炒脆，隨時起鍋，放入磁罐內，惟罐蓋須俟肉鬆冷透，始能蓋上，吾則，容易回軟而不脆了。（瘦秋）</p>

<p>— 秦王茵玖</p>
<p>兩個寒暄了幾句話，早到了得月樓，就在樓上揀張桌子坐了。</p>
<p>「那天你們的小官官大概是受驚不淺了？我倒也是親眼見到的！」一盃茶喝過，吳二便首先提到正文上來，也不用余仲淸詰問他，他就儘量的把那天大家弄一條赤練蛇來恐嚇那小啞叭的情形說了出來：只把他自己從主動的地位上，搬到了旁觀的地位上去。</p>
<p>「原來如此！余仲淸聽了，似乎很傷感地嘆了一口氣。</p>
<p>「余先生，奇怪是的確很奇怪的」兩顆胡桃仍在吳二的手里格格地響着。」你們那小官官的膽子原不見小，什麼東西也不曾見他怕過，論力氣是更敎我吳二佩服了；却不懂他為什麼這樣……這樣的怕蛇？」</p>
<p>余仲淸並不就答復，先用一雙奕奕有神的眼珠望吳二那張很猴急的臉上轉了兩轉，其時他已明白這個好事之徒此刻特地邀他來吃茶的用意了，但他也不願讓吳二失望，終於把眞情說了出來。</p>
<p>「吳二哥，你看我現在已是一個安分的莊稼人了，」余仲淸把自已身上穿的一條靑布短襖抖了一抖。「從前我却是一個殺人不眨眼的軍官，你也許也知道；再從前呢？我們一家人全是獵戶。十數年前，在湖南，我們湘陰余姓倒也很有幾分小名氣；不是兄弟誇口的話，無論他是一等凶惡的大蟲，碰到我們就不用想回去。可是說來也傷心：我的祖父和父親打了一輩子的虎豹豺狼，也不曾失過一决手，臨了却都死在蛇的毒牙上。……個混身潰爛而死，一個腫得比牛還大，幾乎不能下棺……」。</p>
<p>余仲淸的臉上已漸漸地湧出了一股又怒又怕的神色，這得吳二也有些毛髮悚然起來。</p>
<p>「他們臨死時都說蛇是最陰毒的東西，無論一等的英雄好漢，見了它還是躱避躱避的好；從此，我們家里的人，便互相可嚀，見了蛇就忙着躱避。偏是我們那二哥不信，他的拳脚工夫也最高，竟立志耍給父親和祖父報仇，一見蛇便非得斫死它不肯歇手。那知有一决他把一條不滿三尺長的小靑蛇斫成了三段，眼看已是死了，就懶得葬掉；第二天走過，一瞧已剩了中間和末尾兩段，找了半天，仍不見頭部那一截。正待走回去，忽然覺得自巳褲襠裏有什麼東西在蠕動，慌忙拉掉褲子已來不及了，那一裁蛇頭已死命鑽進了他的肛門中去，這樣當然是完了！」</p>
<p>吳二聽得又是怕又是出神，不覺呆着臉，儘望余仲淸苦笑。</p>
<p>「那時候我這孩子才四歲，却已很懂得人事，眼見他伯父在地上滾了兩日兩夜才死去，竟跟着嚇倒了；以後只要我們提起一個蛇字，他就會嚇得哭起來。」余仲淸說到這裹，忍不住又嘆了一口氣：」所以今天承你吳二哥一片好心問起這件事情，我便老實奉吿，順便懇求你向各位街坊打個招呼，千萬別再跟我這小啞叭開玩笑！兄弟眞是感激不盡！」</p>
<p>吳二忍不住就在自已的腿上槌了兩下，表示非常悔恨的意思，再瞧金仲淸時，兩個眼圈已全紅了。（完）</p>

<p>梅夫人原籍廣東，幼生於香港，六七歲時隨慈母游檳香山，先後住了十年，纔留學於美國哥崙比亞大學，研究教育，與梅先生是同學，回國結婚後就僑居上海，算來已二十多年了。伊說我所以願為社會服務的原因，是為了幼時在海外受着種種刺激，覺得一個女子，非得在社會上努力不可。像檀島及美國到處有我們華僑的踪跡，不論男的女的，一向受外人不平等的歧視，國力不强，固然是重大原因，而僑胞智識程度的低劣，關係也很不淺。我是女子，有智識的女子，怎樣可以為女同胞提高能力？爭得國際平等的地位？那是我立定的志願。當年我國駐外使領的夫人們，也都是思想陳舊，不知國際禮貌，所以在國際地位上有很多吃虧的地方，外人譏我中國人不是優秀的民族，你想寃氣受得了麼？後來到了上海，我决心為女同胞爭地位，改變國際間藐視我女同胞的態度。</p>
<p>那時海上婦女團體，簡直沒有，我們便聯絡女界的先進，集中力量，組織起來，共同為社會服務，先成立全國女靑年會協會，作為先鋒的隊伍，提儡婦女體育，講求婦女衛生；辦理婦女補習敎育；增進婦女智德體三育的效率；幸賴各界恊助，近來已有相當成效。我在這會里，工作二十年，做了七年的會長，精力盡了不少。此外萬國婦女恊曾，中國婦女會，也是我效勞的兩大團體。到今朝，海上的國際婦女，不但感覺中國女子並非低能兒，而且以爲中國女子服務的精神，或許比她們來得高强，可惜同志還是太少，沒有普遇到整個的婦女羣衆。</p>
<p>據她二十年來偶導婦運的經騐，覺得中國婦女的智力，並不比西洋女子低，不過體力稍遜，她深感上流社會的婦女，多半缺乏社會思想與國家觀念，她們只管自己享樂，把賓貴的光陰，虛擲於不正當娛樂之中。要如多化一點時光，多費一點精神；多捐一點金錢；來為貧苦大衆着想，謀婦女本身的利益，那末社會革新，必大有希望。中等家庭的婦女，經濟狀况雖然差些，但可撥出時間與精力，買獻於社會，先要訓練自己的能力，發展個人的抱負，凡不明瞭的事物，應力求了解，勤於學問，不能專為了家庭而埋沒自己的壯志。至於貧苦的婦女，說來眞可憐，辛勤終年，不得溫飽，我們雖有救濟的宏願，可是杯水車薪難得普及，這是整個政治，經濟，社會，的問題，非有國家的力量，是不易改善的。她又說上海是這麼大的都市，而女靑年會到現在還租人家的房子，沒有田產，沒有基金，不要說不及外國，而且不及廣東，香港，北平的女靑年會，在這一點，深為上海多數婦女對於社會事業冷淡的心理可惜！</p>
<p>梅夫人也談到自已的家庭，她說我們是新家庭的組織，上無親長，一切都由我夫婦倆作主，現在有男女二人，都在求學時期，家庭生活，取簡單經濟的方式，我從來上午處理家政，下午便為上述三個婦女團體工作，年來會務較前發達，所以日常事項，也算得繁瑣，但對此與趣甚濃，毫不覺得厭倦的心思。最後我問她中國婦女應怎樣做，纔能適合現代的需要？她想了一想，很沉着的說：「所謂時代，所謂潮流一刻不停的在變遷，但我輩婦女，且不問它變遷得怎樣，勤求學問，修養道德，是最要緊的。有了學問，道德，就可以適應時代的需耍。婦女要盡本分之外，分餘力貢獻於社會，有些人舉起手來，喊着男女平權，一面只是享樂，我是不贊成的……</p>
<p>我和她僅僅談了十分鐘，而她說話的沉着與懇摯，却留了一層很深的印象。</p>

<p>鄙人對於製藥一道。亦旣研究有素矣。然未有見如「面麗」用藥之切當。與乎配製之適合也。蓋「面麗」之用原料。旣極高貴。而其製合又完全爲最新的科學方法。故其治療功效。逈非他種美容品所可比擬。患者無論有雀斑或面皰。若每日搽以「而麗」。見效殊爲迅速。往往使人出於意外。且常搽允能白嫩皮膚。與預防雀斑面皰之發生。故極能受靑年男女之歡迎。與乎醫学界之贊美。作者家人親友。亦多用之有騐。敢樂爲濡筆記之。</p>

<p>— 周戈</p>
<p>三月九日新聞報本埠附刋土有篇文章是題名曰：爲一個孩子請命，鬻書求學，一裏面講的大意是這樣：有一個在　　中學讀書的少年，這學期要畢業了，然而因爲家境貧困，而畢業又是重要關頭？他的父親雖然在東凑西併，才好容易集了二十只老洋，然還少十塊錢，没法可想，只得把他家裏藏着的一百五十多本的幼童文庫由定價在十八元左右而减售到十元來出賣，以補學費的不足。</p>
<p>現社會是個講求「資格」的社會，而所「資格」者，常在一張「畢業文憑」上表現出來。你有「畢業文憑」，就有資格在社會上渴飯吃，不管你這張畢業文憑是吾與求飯吃的實際智識的應用上相配合，然而似乎畢業文憑就是給你吃飯的一個方便蹬書。因此，社會上犯罪者多了一種，就是偽造「證書」。</p>
<p>可是社會在現在，是不景氣到極點了。你縱有「畢業文憑」，也保不定就有飯吃，或甚至是博士頭銜的金字招牌，這不景氣的社會也給你個「不睬」！公司機會一次招攷，就有成千成百的持着畢業文憑的大中學生，可是結果只取了十個人左右。</p>
<p>要「畢業文憑」作啥呀？如果眞正爲「孩子請命」，我們應該給孩子求得一種與孩子實際本身有休戚相關的學問。然而求學問不一定要到學校裏，現代學校所給與靑年們的，在謀生上講，只是不合謀生實際的應用，在學校裏讀了六年中學書，一出學校除了一二種稍可用用外，什麼都是白費了時光的，一個中學畢業生，你呌他做做代數看，他早忘了一半了，或甚至會把分數，四則應用題也都忘了的！再在思想上講，正如王紀元先生所講：「學校給與靑年的敎育，多半是敷衍，是宣傳，是欺骗，是架空而不切實際的智識。」</p>
<p>我們應該爲「孩子請命」，獲取實際的知識！</p>

<p>— 蕭雯</p>
<p>「O！Mornig」！小唐一頭光頭髮，挾着一冊洋裝書，跳出來。那裏的電燈也亮着了，幾個人圍着桌子看夜報，對於那句不陌生的話，擠一擠眼睛，有的還點一點頭。</p>
<p>小唐也拿起一張Shanghai　Tinmes不管懂不懂張大着眼烏子轉，那張大美晚報在小廣東手裏他有點恨又不好意思搶。</p>
<p>是時候了？人也來着一大堆，四處溜。</p>
<p>噹！噹！噹！</p>
<p>「上課了！上課了」！不知誰在都裏喊：小</p>
<p>小唐揮掉報紙，大步跨上樓，開進第三敎室的門，半屋子的人頭，擇老座位放穩了屁股。</p>
<p>皮鞋聲響帶上來一大批人，拖着座位找自己的座位，噪聲里穿着大衣的敎師上了講壇，大家屁股提空一下，灣一　腰，頭點幾下。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>「今朝是…」一口蘇腔的敎師。</p>
<p>「今天是Grammar」！第二排第七號的喉嚨。</p>
<p>啊唷，書沒有帶來，</p>
<p>第一排第四號借了一冊書給敎師，第五號的座位便併得緊緊地。</p>
<p>小廣東坐在末一排，隨意地。</p>
<p>小唐不時伸手到袋裏挖花生米嚼。</p>
<p>「Page　Three　The　Past　Progressive　Form　and　the　Past　Perlect……」一口蘇腔的英語。</p>
<p>敎室裏靜着。正正經經．</p>
<p>第二排第七號戴着一頂學生帽，臉上的筋肉有力地，嘴張得圓圓地，一個呵欠，呵欠的聲音吞入了肚皮。</p>
<p>呵欠是傳染的，第三排第七號也來一個輕微的，小唐也來一個，原來他的花生米早喫完。書上的字一片模糊，眼睛灑得張不開，只聽見不整齊的句子：小唐有點不敢瞌睡的倦意。</p>
<p>第五排二個小孩子專心的看着書，只是一本，一頁頁慢慢翻過去，眼快的阿張回頭去一揮，是本滿是直行字的書。阿張也不管，恨自己不會把小五俠義傳也帶了來。也是一個呵欠。</p>
<p>敎師格格地讀着一句長句子，不時把字音變了腔，露出了靑筋，也不管得幾位高足的談笑——。　　「Complete　the　following　sentences……」</p>
<p>噹！噹！噹！</p>
<p>迅速地書合攏來的噪聲，小唐也驚醒了，抹一抹口角的涶沬。</p>
<p>「下面的句子，你們明朝交卷吧。」</p>
<p>「好！好：」</p>
<p>「十二句全要做喲」！</p>
<p>下樓梯的皮鞋響起來，敎師沒精神地戴了呢帽，走出——課堂。小唐從縱橫的座位裏穿出來，伸起手再來一個呵欠，高聲地呌一下。</p>
<p>「小唐！甚麼樣，比跳舞更費力吧」！小廣東和他一起走下樓，大家笑笑。</p>
<p>「今天聖愛娜茶舞，有蛋糕，花二毛錢，坐一會，去！」</p>
<p>「啊！」又是一個呵欠，「去一趟也好，」小唐的精神來了。</p>
<p>兩位英雄下了樓，洋裝書袋裏一塞</p>
<p>休息室裏，大家在看報。</p>
<p>第二排第七號拿着大晚報，拉一拉阿張的手：</p>
<p>「融光還不錯，麗都也好」。</p>
<p>噹！噹！噹！</p>

<p>— 祝康</p>
<p>落雪方停的時候，暴風就猛烈的在特魯布庫拉平原上咆哮起來。廣漠無邊的原野蓋着白皚皚的雪，雲端的山密和遼遠的地平綫，到處都像撒遍了天鵝絨。太陽暈頭腦的在凍雲中掙扎，有時朝下面雪地閃一下臉，趕快又把那慘淡的光明收縮回去。寒冷逞强的使起威嚴來，把整個平原給封鎖了，雪片漸漸的凝固着，風尖撥着雪粒在平原上製造雪嶺，雪原慢慢的起了變化，有的地方高起來，有的地方落下去，原野彷彿一片翻着白浪的大海。</p>
<p>父親桑巴圖查汗換上他那輕易不穿的塗遍油膩的大紫袍，雖然在陰晦的天氣裏，袍上的油光仍舊閃閃爍爍。他滿身都是高興，似乎這世界上就只有他一個人最幸福！自然囉！他的兒子病到那步田地遽然會好起來，無論是誰都要歡欣慰快的。兒子的病能够好，完全是活佛諾謝汗顏的神力。他曾經向活佛許過願，所以他的獨生子托比托剛剛好，他就忙着帶他到扎爾都扎布平原去給活佛獻禮。</p>
<p>托比托這孩子雖說病好利落了，但他那久病的枯瘦的身子並沒復原，可是桑巴圖查汗父親一點也不注意這些，他給愉快弄得幾乎瘋狂了，一生他是最忠實虔誠的生活着，從沒有一絲苟且的行爲。旣然向活佛許下願，病好了就得馬上去還願。</p>
<p>一消早桑巴圖查汗就把牲畜計算淸楚了，他把牲畜的肥大的結實的都挑出來：二十隻羊，兩匹爲，四隻駱駝，五頭牛，把牠們趕在一起，天不到已分時候他就帶着托比托，趕着牲畜羣離開特魯布庫拉平原向着扎爾都扎布進發。</p>
<p>在嚴寒的襲擊之下，牲畜都變得異常馴服了，桑巴圖查汗騎在馬上抱着托比托，牲畜都規規矩矩的跟在後邊走。蹄蹟在雪地上越踏越多，風浪翻天倒地的顚撲着，羊坐的哀呌，馬不時的甩着鬣上雪粒。桑巴圖查汗的鼻涕一滴一滴的落到紫袍的前裾上，他只顧向前遠望，別的什麼地都沒留心。</p>
<p>托比托凍得牙床都有些發硬了：</p>
<p>——爸……爸……冷……</p>
<p>——前面就到了。桑巴圖查汗指着魯提斯干山說。</p>
<p>當他和牲口羣轉過魯提斯干山脚時，迎面奔過一羣肩槍騎馬的靑年人樣子很像獵手。等到他們碰在一塊，領頭的一個靑年勒住了馬，恭恭敬敬的對桑巴圖查汗說：</p>
<p>——老伯伯！您到哪兒去？</p>
<p>——我是往扎爾都扎布去給活佛獻禮的。</p>
<p>那小伙子笑，非常溫和，喀爾喀人的粗野的氣味一點都沒有。他勸慰的說</p>
<p>——老伯伯！　　强盜昨天在坎赤克哈沐打死了我們的防守兵，扎爾都扎布的科學伊克昭的喇嘛是內线！</p>
<p>桑巴圖查汗麻木似的不知如何是好了？他早就聽到許多關於諾謝汗顏活佛的謠言，現在是成了事實！他低下頭來看看自己的孩子，哎喲！托此托死了！渾身都硬了！</p>
<p>——不必犯難，我們一道去，把××强盜趕出去！</p>
<p>桑巴圖查汗握緊了拳頭，從他那枯老的喉嚨裏喊出一股吼聲：</p>
<p>——去跟××强盜拚！</p>

<p>— 蟄人</p>
<p>小喜對着她的小朋友們說：我姐姐出嫁了。小喜不明白出嫁是怎麼回事，不過別人家的姐姐都沒有出嫁，她姐姐出嫁就顯得有點比衆不同的樣子。</p>
<p>姐姐歡喜小喜，小喜也歡喜她的姐姐。在小朋友淘里談起歡喜自己的人的時候，小喜常常漏去她的爸爸媽媽而說姐姐的。談到各人的姐姐的時侯，小喜又是固執地說她姐姐最好；但是小喜說不出姐姐最好的理由。小朋友們是不肯服輸的，自家的姐姐爲什麼沒有小喜的姐姐好呢？好好玩着的，爲着姐姐總吵個不歡而散。小喜沒有得到最後之勝利，就哭着回家來吿訴姐姐，姐姐替她拭乾了眼淚，抱她坐在膝蓋上，講一段好笑的故事，等到小喜破涕爲笑的時候，才勸告她不要同小朋友們爭吵，姐姐都是好的。但是小喜總是不服氣，沒有幾天，又發生了同樣的事。</p>
<p>姐姐出嫁的那天，小喜可得意極了。家過開敞着大門，大廳上滿掛着燈彩，自己穿了新製的袍子。她一早站到大門外去，看見一個小朋友，就誇耀着我姐姐出嫁了。小喜認爲這是姐姐最好的理由，她今天才找到了答案。小朋友們也是穿着紅的綠的，他們規矩地做出專門來吃喜酒的樣子，他們祗是笑着，不像平常時候一說到姐姐馬上撅起小嘴唇來鬥嘴了。小朋友們懂得做客是應該客客氣氣的，他們可以說出許許多多理由來回駁小喜，姐姐出嫁有什麼希奇呢？但是他們沒有回答小喜，擁着瞧新娘娘去了。這自然更使小喜高興的，她的姐姐終究是好的。</p>
<p>下午，一隊穿着制服的軍樂隊從門外直敲到大廳上，有大鼓，小鼓，喇叭，那末許多好玩的束西。小喜和小朋友們常在曠塲上學着大軍進行曲的樣子，用小拳頭向胸前擂着就裝做敲鼓，伸長了手臂，用十個小指頭向空按捺，是做吹喇叭的，同時大家嘴里學着各種樂器的聲音，祗要他們聽見過的。現在小喜瞧見了那末多的樂器，她用手一揮，彷彿執着指揮刀似的，想招呼小朋友們實地演習大軍進行曲。但是小朋友們都沒有平時那樣玩皮，樂隊在大廳上吹奏着的時候，他們馬上佔據了一個坐位，又是一回什麼把戲，呌瞧新官人。</p>
<p>做過了許許多多新奇的花樣，小喜簡直獃住了，那些小朝友也瞧出了神的樣子，大家斯文地站着，坐着。最後，小喜的姐姐出來了，小喜得意地望着小朋友們，想表示我的姐姐是那末最好的一個。那些小朋友却是自顧歡呼着，瞧新娘子，小喜看着一乘掛着纓絡的花轎把她姐姐抬走了。她發了急，想追上前去，客廳上是滿擁着人，她只能拉住媽媽的衣角問：「姐姐到什麼地方去？」媽媽見她紅着眼睛，似乎要哭的樣子，忙抱了她上後屋去，像姐姐一樣替她拭眼淚，坐在膝蓋上‘吻着她的臉說…「姐姐出嫁了，到姐夫家里去。女孩子都要出嫁的，你將來也要坐上花花連在子抬走的。」</p>
<p>小喜祇是張大着眼睛，出嫁原來是這樣一回事，那末，她問媽媽，姐姐什麼時候回來呢？</p>
<p>沒有幾天姐姐回來了，那個新倌人也陪着來，小喜見了那個陌生男子就生氣，他奪走了她的姐姐。晚上，姐夫走了，姐姐却住在家里，小喜高興得什麼似的扭着姐姐要講故事，但是她看見姐姐哭紅着眼睛的時候，她慢慢地退到媽媽懷里，懷疑地注視着，她覺得她不懂的事情太多，姐姐回到家里來爲什麼要哭呢？</p>
<p>媽又是吻着她的臉說：「姐夫不好，欺侮姐姐了」。小喜伸伸小拳頭回答她媽，我打妣夫去，以後不要他再來，姐姐也不要到他家重去。但是媽搖搖頭，小喜覺得很是失望。她雖然有那樣一個最好的姐姐，不過她不懂的事實在太多了。</p>

<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>照例，村子里一過了廢曆正月十三，又會另有一番活潑景象了；東村興馬燈，西鄉出龍會的，那些辛勞了一年的農人，在這幾天里是要來儘量狂歡一下，舒一舒那口給生活壓迫了好久的氣，就是一舞婦女和孩子們，也會日里東夜間西的奔忙了起來。</p>
<p>三和今天在鎭上茶館里聽到石人頭今年又要興馬燈了，他就高與得像個孩子似的，跳躍地將從茶館里帶來的消息來吿訴他的老婆：</p>
<p>「石人頭的馬燈是興定人，聽說日子已揀好，是正月十六，後天，正月十六就是後天。」</p>
<p>「人家興龍燈馬燈要你起勁點什麼呢！」三和娘子却對他斜了一眼，冷冷地回答着，仍舊自顧舖她的鞋底。</p>
<p>想不到他一塲歡喜只落得來換了他老婆一股冷氣，他正覺得掃興；但自已想想當時的一團高興，也實在傻得太可笑了，怪不得要去碰她這一下釘子。</p>
<p>他悶悶地坐在矮凳上，一口氣把那支旗美牌香烟抽完了，接着又燃上了一支。他想：這里的馬燈在從前是每年從正月十三四里起，要看到月底爲止的，可是自從農村里受水災旱荒，兵燹匪禍，和苛稅雜捐的重重壓迫之後，鄉下人時常在連生活都威到困難，還那來這興緻發起什麼燈會？石人頭那一向很有名的馬燈也三四年沒有出了；而且當時自已還是在那馬燈里扮過地戲的。今年難得又有人在將這停頓了三四年的馬燈重新興起來，自然我也應該去扮點什麼，折字先生，啣牌算命，打齋飯，隨便什麼都行，總之只須做得相像，說得發鬆就得。……　（未完）</p>

<p>弱柳絲絲起嫩黃。桃花含蕊競新妝。春色惱人眠不得。一枝紅杏出東牆。點綴春光和煦裏。紅肥綠瘦鬥奇香。一葉一花均入畫。鶯啼燕笑蝶蜂在。更喜那。草木逢春都康健。連朝風信醒黃粱。一望半原風景好。好花枝。常伴紫薇朗。相的朋儕游春去。迎人小草拂橫塘。還喜那。柳欲抽條桃欲放。自有深情費較量。要曉得。佳景原來春最好。天然圖畫在江鄉。待到那。三月春光深處裹。千紅萬紫更芬芳。不過是。一樣韶華有幾樣看。我來分別話端詳。有的是。少婦思春心繚亂。困人天氣更茫茫。偶見陌頭楊柳綠。倒說道。夫婿封侯願未嘗。有的是。少女名媛在蘭房裏。深閨寂寂繡鴛鴦。忽覺惱人春色到。手倦拋書午夢長。有的是。伉儷情深情脈脈。憑欄賞鑒好風光。相的踏靑郊外去。濃情蜜蜜話相莊。有的是。墨客騷人同作伴。杏花村裏共飛觴。有的是。孀婦思夫情慘切。懶看春色臥牙床。雖然是。一種愁懷忘不得。怎對得。擾人春夢九廻腸。所以是。春景原來無彼此。有人歡笑有凄凉。說說談談也何妨</p>

<p>Studying Countermeasures for the Situation in North China; Isotani Arrived in Peiping Last Night to Visit Song; Will Go to Ji'nan to Meet with Han Before Returning to Shanghai</p>

The date for an audience with the Japanese Emperor to present his credentials will be decided after the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs requests instructions. (Thirteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo – China's new ambassador to Japan, Mr. Xu Shiying, arrived at Tokyo Station at 8:00 AM on the third.

<p>To Return to Shanghai on the 21st to Await Orders to Return Home</p>
<p>Nanjing – According to the latest Tokyo telegraphic dispatch received tonight, Japanese Ambassador Arita has indeed been internally appointed as Foreign Minister of Japan. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 21st to await the formal announcement of the order and then depart for home. (Thirteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo – This decision was made by Prime Minister Hirota, who appointed Ambassador to China Arita Hachiro as Foreign Minister and telegraphed him to return home as soon as negotiations with the National Government have reached a certain stage. Therefore, Ambassador Arita will leave China in early April to assume the post of Foreign Minister. (Dentsu dispatch, thirteenth)</p>
<p>Nanjing – After Japanese Ambassador Arita arrived in Nanjing, he paid visits to President Chiang and Foreign Minister Zhang. He plans to meet with Foreign Minister Zhang again in the next few days to exchange preliminary views on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. It is heard that Hirota, the new Prime Minister of Japan, intends to appoint Ambassador Arita as Foreign Minister and has telegraphed to solicit his consent. (Thirteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>Dentsu Local Dispatch – The previous rumor that the Japanese Ambassador to China would be appointed as Foreign Minister has now become a reality, so he will soon return home to display his successful diplomatic skills under Prime Minister Hirota. The Chinese side believes that Ambassador Arita is a hard-liner towards China, perhaps due to a misunderstanding about his elder brother, Yamamoto Teijiro, who actively advocated clarifying the national polity. In fact, the ambassador is a liberal within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. During the Manchurian Incident, he clashed with hard-liners such as the directors of the Asian Affairs Bureau and the director of the Intelligence Department, Shiratori. At that time, there was a joke about the conflict between "Shiratori (White Bird) and Arita," with no one getting hurt. Therefore, it is not difficult to imagine that because he is a liberal, his demeanor is relatively mild, but he holds strong principles internally. If there is a conflict, he will not yield. During his time as secretary and consul-general in Chicago, Ottawa, and Honolulu, he was a diligent worker. At the Washington Conference, as the chief secretary, he thoroughly processed a large number of official documents, causing him to faint from the steam in the room. The scar that remains on his forehead is a reminder of his efforts at that time. He is now 53 years old.</p>

Five survey teams were dispatched on the thirteenth to conduct section-by-section surveys and construction will be carried out according to the conscription method.

<p>Joint Defense and Bandit Suppression on the Fujian-Guangdong Border</p>
<p>Guangzhou – Local newspapers are paying great attention to the news that conspirators are planning to establish an autonomous government in Fujian Province, adopting a calm attitude. However, local newspapers believe that the situation is extremely dangerous. Some outspoken newspapers openly point out that the Japanese are behind the scenes, saying that the Japanese intend to occupy Fujian Province as the first step in invading southern China. According to reports, on March 1, several dismissed security team leaders from Fujian Province held a meeting to organize an autonomous government, planning to first organize a Fujian Provincial People's Autonomous Association and a Southern Fujian People's Army, and then establish autonomous governments in Dehua, Huian, and other four places. Huian is the supply port for Taiwan and other places, and supplies can enter from there. Japanese officials have not expressed their opinions on the Fujian Province autonomy movement, but they have firmly denied the claim that the autonomy movement is being assisted by the Japanese.

<h3 id="e14">Prospects for the London Conference <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>—隅</p>
<p>The meeting of the Administrative Council of the League of Nations and the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty has moved from Geneva to London. As a pillar of the League of Nations and an important guarantor of the Locarno Treaty, Britain will undoubtedly play an important role in this decision-making meeting. We will once again see the Conservative Party diplomats of Downing Street working hard for the collective security they have been advocating day and night. The haze in Europe is as thick as the fog in London. Before we ask whether British diplomats have the means to clear the clouds and see the blue sky, let us first ask whether Britain, dominated by stubborn conservatives, can be an impartial intermediary.</p>
<p>Naturally, we should not doubt the sincerity of the British peace angels. But when we analyze Britain's past diplomacy, we faintly see a cunning expression hidden behind the charitable faces of the British peace angels.</p>
<p>Some political commentators, such as Stead, a authority in the British press, believe that recent British diplomats lack a long-term vision, and their foreign policy also lacks a consistent focus, often changing, which has sown many evils for world peace. He first cited the diplomatic failure of Britain during the "Manchurian Incident" in 1931. At that time, British politicians, in order to shirk the "responsibility of collective security," did not strictly abide by the provisions of the "League of Nations," the "Kellogg Pact," and the "Nine-Power Treaty," resulting in nothing being accomplished in the Far East issue and the disarmament conference. This is one example. Another example is that in early 1933, the countries of Central Europe had great hopes for unity. At that time, the relationship between Poland and Soviet Russia was quite close, and Poland was also planning to conclude a permanent treaty of friendship with Czechoslovakia and become a part of the Little Entente. However, just when the opportunity was ripe, former British Prime Minister MacDonald and former Foreign Secretary Simon were suddenly hooked by the German "Nazi" party and flew to Rome to establish a four-power agreement with Mussolini. MacDonald gave a speech in the House of Commons advocating the revision of the treaty and taking the abolition of the Polish Corridor as its first step. Polish General Pilsudski, disappointed, reversed his previous policy and automatically negotiated with Germany to establish the German-Polish Pact, and the permanent friendship between Czechoslovakia and Poland was aborted. This is the second example. Another example is that in June 1935, Britain and Germany concluded a naval agreement. Germany's status suddenly rose, and German cruisers patrolled the East, demonstrating force as far as the Gulf of Finland. "Nazis" such as Rosenberg also eagerly sharpened their swords and prepared to try their skills in the Baltic Sea. As a result, France became closer to Italy because of Britain's pro-German stance, and Italy dared to use force in East Africa. In Stead's view, the short-sighted diplomacy of the British Conservative Party cannot escape its responsibility. This is the third example.</p>
<p>We agree with most of Stead's views above, but Stead only discusses the impact and does not explore the reasons why the Conservative Party's policy is so. The claim that the Conservative Party's political vision suffers from short-sightedness is not so simple. We know that we must not forget that the Conservative Party, which represents landowners, nobles, and capitalists, inherently hates the Soviet Union, which is now the center of collective security in Europe and has close relations with France. The conclusion of a friendly agreement between France and Soviet Russia means that the relationship between France and Britain is estranged while the relationship between France and the Soviet Union is closer. Although this is Britain reaping the consequences of its own actions, Britain does not want such an agreement to appear in Europe no matter how much British diplomats verbally advocate collective security. Naturally, the Franco-Soviet Pact is a manifestation of collective security, which is no different from the Conservative Party's so-called collective security in a broad sense. If the Conservative Party is truly committed to collective security, it would be too late to support it, let alone oppose it. But we must know that the Conservative Party's so-called collective security is substantially different from that of the Soviet Union. Their so-called collective security is not the so-called "indivisible peace," but the pseudonym of "regionalization of war." In other words, the collective security of Britain is enough as long as the war does not break out west of the Rhine. If there is a war east of the Rhine, Britain can ignore it. Therefore, the so-called collective security of Britain is to prevent Germany from attacking the west, rather than to preserve the peace of the entire Europe or the entire world.</p>
<p>If the above observation is not very far from the truth, then we can understand why Britain has only worked hard to sign the Western European Air Convention in the past and why it is not concerned about the Eastern European League. Why did it sign a naval agreement with Germany alone, regardless of the opposition of the great powers? Why did France and other related countries panic when Germany declared the abolition of the Locarno Treaty, while Britain was indifferent? We take the past as an example to predict the future. We can predict that in this London conference, the key figures of Downing Street in Britain will not be impartial intermediaries. Before the London Conference even opened, we have already heard that Britain does not advocate sanctions against Germany, but advocates that the Locarno relations countries talk to Germany. Today's Britain is no longer France's old partner before the war. It will never act as a strong pillar of the Locarno Treaty as France hopes. Britain hopes that Germany will withdraw part of its troops stationed on the Rhine and not set up fortifications along the river, but it is only a hope. With France's tough attitude, Germany's insistence, Britain's cunning, and Italy's waiting for a price, the outcome of the London Conference may be like other European conferences, ending in failure and discord.</p>

<p>Karlsruhe – Last night, 70 special trains carrying residents from areas such as Baden, where troops were heavily stationed in the Rhineland, entered Karlsruhe to listen to Hitler explain his peace plan. The German leader, after receiving a warm welcome from 70,000 people, stated that the first priority for Germany and France is to be on an absolutely equal footing. Only when they are equal can they respect each other. Germany has no intention of attacking France or Poland, so Germany has taken the treaties between France and Poland lightly. However, the mutual assistance agreement signed between France and Russia is different. The German people have experience with the meaning of communism and deeply know that any country that cannot defend itself to resist the aims of the Communist Party will suffer its scourge. The German leader went on to detail his proposal, which is to conclude a 25-year non-aggression pact and an air pact to replace the Locarno Pact, which is the greatest work that any German can do. He also said that Germany cannot often have someone who can contribute 25 years of peace to 67 million people. Finally, he said that the time has now come to accept Germany as an equal member of the community of nations. (Reuters dispatch, thirteenth)</p>
<p>Karlsruhe – German leader Hitler delivered a speech to 60,000 residents of the Rhineland today and warned the world that he has proposed a plan for the appeasement of Europe, and if it is rejected, he will never be willing to make any suggestions again. Mr. Hitler then attacked war with his determination to abandon the Locarno Pact and the Treaty of Versailles, but also said that Germany would not hesitate to go to war with other countries in order to seek equality. The reason why Germans regard war as terrible is not because Germans are afraid, but because if war breaks out, the whole world will suffer its poison. Now that he is calling loudly for peace, he must call loudly for international equality. Mr. Hitler compared Germany when the National Socialist Party seized power in 1933 with today's Germany, saying that today's Germany is the most peaceful country in the world. Mr. Hitler pointed to France, fourteen miles away, and told it that there are now two countries here, although there are all kinds of past hatreds, but they can all exist. They often meet with weapons, but their borders have only changed by fifty kilometers. If this situation continues, there is no way to resolve it. Reason should indicate the way to resolve it. Regarding the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty, Mr. Hitler said that France had previously concluded alliances with Czechoslovakia and Poland, and Germany had never opposed them because it had no intention of provoking them. What does France want? We do not yet know. However, we have already known the ambitions of the Communist Party. We have already seen what it has done in Germany. Mr. Hitler continued, there are now millions of Frenchmen who are willing to live in harmony with the Germans, but communism is an ominous thing. Only with equality as the foundation can a new order in Europe be built. I have made new suggestions to the world, and the breadth of their content is rare. Neighboring countries may be able to calm down and work with us. This is our greatest hope. (National News dispatch, twelfth)</p>
<p>Karlsruhe – Hitler delivered an election speech here, with a very peaceful tone, roughly saying, "I do not want to celebrate military glory, because I have experienced this kind of hardship. Compared with international politicians and any soldiers, I have experienced quite a lot. I deeply feel that war is cruel and terrible, not because we are cowardly, but because war itself is cruel and terrible. They regard war as a good thing, not because they are brave, but because war can give them considerable benefits. I want to build a monument in the hearts of the people, but a peace monument is far better than a war victory tower. Now a 12-inch shell costs 3,000 marks. If I add another 1,500 marks, I can build a worker's house. If I launch a million of these shells, there will be no benefit, but the total value can build countless workers' houses."

<p>London – Representatives of the Locarno Treaty signatory nations, namely Great Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium, held an important meeting here this afternoon, unanimously resolving that Germany’s reoccupation of the demilitarized Rhineland constitutes a clear violation of Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Treaty. The League of Nations Council should be requested to declare this point. To facilitate a more detailed study of the situation arising from Germany’s actions, a small committee has been appointed and is scheduled to meet at 11:30 tomorrow morning.

<p>League of Nations Meeting Procedures Today</p>
<p>London – The situation in Europe is considered very serious here, as France is determined to deal with Germany’s abrogation of treaties in a stern manner. It is expected that tomorrow’s meeting of the League of Nations Council will be merely a formality and will not immediately discuss fundamental issues. Tomorrow’s procedure will be nothing more than recording Germany’s breach of the Locarno Treaty and appointing a committee to discuss and report on how to address the problem. This report will be sent to the Locarno Treaty signatory nations, after which the representatives of the countries concerned will hold several decisive meetings and private talks. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>London – The League of Nations Council is scheduled to meet here tomorrow. The venue has been selected as the “Queen Anne Room” on the second floor of St. James’s Palace. This room is of great historical value. From this morning, palace staff have been busy cleaning, with a high degree of tension. The adjoining room, known as the “Ante-Room,” will be reserved for secretaries and typists. The room is equipped with a horseshoe-shaped conference table, around which the representatives of each nation will sit during the meeting. The floor is covered with a red carpet to protect the antique holly wood flooring. Firewood is burning in the fireplaces to maintain a suitable temperature. Meanwhile, specialists dispatched by the Post Office are busy installing telegraph and telephone lines (a total of 200 lines) for use by the national representatives and journalists.

<p>A Strong Atmosphere for Sanctions Against Germany</p>
<p>London – Europe today is close to a major conflict. The foreign ministers of ten nations are awaiting the meeting of the League of Nations Council in an atmosphere of extreme tension. As the meeting approaches, the possibility of imposing economic sanctions on Germany seems to have become more likely. A leading British financier told the Associated Press that he believes war with Germany is very possible. Diplomatic circles, however, remain rather detached, not believing in talk of war. However, the united front against Germany has greatly solidified. According to Berlin sources, the German government is very uneasy about sanctions, as the implementation of sanctions may lead to an economic blockade and a boycott of German goods. At the same time, British sentiment has gradually shifted toward France. Public opinion in official and public circles has always sought compromise, but after hearing the speeches of German Chancellor [Adolf] Hitler and Prussian Prime Minister and Minister of Aviation [Hermann] Göring, it has turned tough.

<p>Opposition to Limiting Sovereignty Along the Rhine, Whether Temporarily or Permanently</p>
<p>London – German Ambassador to Great Britain [Leopold von] Hoesch recently delivered a note from his government to Foreign Secretary Eden, stating in essence: "Germany cannot participate in any negotiations that would limit Germany's sovereignty along the Rhine River, regardless of whether the limitation is temporary or permanent. To facilitate the French government’s acceptance of Germany’s proposal, our Chancellor ([Adolf] Hitler referring to himself) wishes to clarify his intention from the outset, namely that Germany’s restoration of its original sovereignty along the Rhine River should only have symbolic significance at this time. The number of troops stationed in several towns along the Rhine River is based on peacetime levels and has been communicated to the military attachés of the British and French embassies in Germany. These numbers will not be increased. Germany does not intend to move these troops closer to the borders of Belgium and France at this time. Both of these measures will be observed during the current negotiations, provided that Belgium and France adopt the same attitude." According to reports, Foreign Secretary Eden asked German Ambassador Hoesch yesterday to convey to his government that “the current situation is extremely serious, and the German government should voluntarily express its sincerity in seeking a compromise to facilitate future negotiations. Is it possible to take ‘symbolic’ action by withdrawing some troops stationed along the Rhine River and at least refraining from increasing the number of stationed troops during the negotiations?” The German note is a response to the questions raised by Foreign Secretary Eden. After the Locarno Treaty signatory nations’ meeting adjourned today, Foreign Secretary Eden, French Foreign Minister Flandin, Belgian Prime Minister Zeeland, and Italian Ambassador Grandi held a secret meeting to discuss the situation. At this time, the delegations of Belgium, France, and Italy remained silent regarding the German reply, while the British Foreign Office has released the contents of the reply to the newspapers. It is generally believed that the British Cabinet, in light of the difficult situation in the reconciliation efforts, should allow public opinion to understand this, so the German reply was released.

<p>No Longer Accommodating Germany, Paris Greatly Relieved</p>
<p>London – The representatives of the Locarno Treaty nations, gathered here this afternoon, were deeply dissatisfied with [Adolf] Hitler’s disregard for the suggestion of British Foreign Secretary [Anthony] Eden, viewing it as mockery of Britain’s moderate attitude towards Germany. The French representatives recognized this as a challenge from the Germans. A British spokesperson told an Associated Press reporter that Britain would no longer adopt an accommodating attitude towards Germany. At the same time, members of the British Conservative Party are pressuring diplomatic authorities to actively cooperate with France and Belgium. According to another report, [Winston] Churchill, [Lord] Hailsham, and [Neville] Chamberlain have all called on the nation to be loyal to the obligations of the Locarno Treaty. (Guomin, 12th)</p>
<p>London – Since Germany’s abrogation of the Locarno Treaty last Saturday, France has been in a state of anxiety every day. Only today does it feel relieved, as the British government has deemed Germany’s recent proposals unsatisfactory and has adopted a firm stance. People in Paris have been greatly impressed by this. According to French opinion, peace can only be achieved through close cooperation between Britain and France. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<p>To Attend the League of Nations Council Meeting</p>
<p>London – The League of Nations Council is scheduled to hold a meeting here on Saturday (i.e., the 14th) at 11:00 AM. League of Nations Secretary-General [Joseph] Avenol, Romanian Foreign Minister [Nicolae] Titulescu, and Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs [Maxim] Litvinov all arrived here this afternoon to attend the Council meeting. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>London – The League of Nations Council will still hold its meeting as originally planned at 11:00 AM on Saturday at St. James’s Palace to consider the European crisis caused by Germany’s unilateral abrogation of the Locarno Treaty. League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol arrived here yesterday with a large staff to prepare for the meeting. British Foreign Secretary [Anthony] Eden had suggested to Germany that, while negotiating a new treaty to replace the Locarno Treaty, it should withdraw all troops from the demilitarized Rhineland area, leaving only a "symbolic" number. This proposal has been rejected by Germany. Therefore, the meeting that day is very important, not only to declare Germany’s violation of the Locarno Treaty, but also to ask it to propose suggestions to adapt to the situation. It is widely rumored that a special committee will be organized to study the issue, and representatives from Denmark, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and South American countries will also be invited to join the committee. The meeting may last for a week.</p>
<p>The committee will propose suggestions based on Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant (which stipulates that any member of the League may withdraw from the League after giving two years’ prior notice, but must, at the time of withdrawal, fulfill all its international obligations and all obligations under this Covenant), and the Council will notify Germany. If Germany ignores this, the Council will have no choice but to convene a general meeting of the League of Nations to hold an extraordinary meeting to decide on actions to take against Germany. French circles now feel that the time has come to discuss the scope of mutual assistance that should be available, and the circumstances in which such mutual assistance should be provided. The French firmly declare that France has never refused to discuss the abolition of the demilitarized zone, and has never regarded this zone as permanent, but only discusses it under the force of accomplished facts. France should refuse. It is said that several countries agree with the attitude held by France. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e24">Berlin Issues Communiqué Criticizing Franco-Soviet Pact <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>If Peace Plans Are Not Considered, Germany Prefers Isolated Self-Defense</p>
<p>London – Berlin issued a communiqué last night stating that if the peace proposals made by [Adolf] Hitler and the reasons for Germany’s abrogation of the Locarno Treaty are not sympathetically considered by other countries, then Germany will abandon its peace efforts and resort to isolated self-defense. French sources in London described this as an attempt by Germany to put pressure on the London negotiations, but did not consider it important, as a breakdown in the London discussions would ultimately leave Germany isolated. The Berlin communiqué first criticized France’s plans to guarantee its security, stating that before the establishment of the Locarno Treaty, France had already concluded military alliances with Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. These alliances were described as defensive in nature, and since Germany had no aggressive intentions, Germany did not oppose these alliances. For the same reason, Germany did not object to France’s massive concentration of troops and construction of fortifications along its borders after the war. As for the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, its nature is truly peculiar, as Russia is committed to world revolution and has declared a program of blatant imperialism and aggression. France already has Great Britain, Belgium, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Italy as guarantors of its security, yet it still needs the support of a huge Russia. At that time, Germany had not taken any action to harm France. Before concluding the Franco-Soviet Pact, France did not notify the signatories of the Locarno Treaty. France’s self-defense plans are very thorough, yet it is now said that the nineteen battalions of German troops sent into the Rhineland will endanger the security guaranteed by half the world. On the one hand, Germany is only occupying its own land with a small number of troops in order to reduce France’s fear and induce France to join negotiations. On the other hand, Germany is also making a great contribution to seeking peace. If its proposal for a twenty-five-year non-aggression pact is accepted by other countries, it will be the first universal European pact after the Treaty of Versailles, without discriminatory measures. When the Franco-Soviet Pact made the Locarno Treaty ineffective, Germany could have declared the direct military occupation of the Rhineland, but Germany did not do so. Instead, it preferred to propose a grand peace plan and limit the rearmament of the Rhineland to a symbolic form. Germany is prepared not to increase its troops stationed in the Rhineland during negotiations, provided that France and Belgium take the same action, but Germany will never give up any part of its sovereignty. Germany firmly believes that a future peace obtained through forced discrimination will sow the seeds of dishonor on the one hand and leave behind latent hatred on the other. Germany is committed to establishing a genuine peace in Europe for the next twenty-five years based on the equal freedom of decision of peoples and nations. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Paris – Foreign Minister [Pierre-Étienne] Flandin, when talking with guests today about the communiqué released by Berlin yesterday, said that France maintains a firm attitude while retaining its measured optimism, and that the German communiqué is an attempt to preempt negotiations.

<p>Experienced observers in the Swiss capital recently expressed the opinion that German Chancellor [Adolf] Hitler’s abrogation of the Locarno Treaty was in fact prompted by the country’s financial situation. The government, facing an inevitable currency devaluation, drafted a large-scale plan for financial and economic reform. Hitler also reoccupied the Rhineland area to divert people’s attention. Once the results of the Reichstag elections are announced and the government achieves victory, it will implement currency devaluation. The Neue Zürcher Zeitung reported, "[Adolf] Hitler asked the people of his country for the necessary assistance when he announced the Reichstag elections would be held on the 29th of this month, in order to seek economic benefits. It can be seen that the talk of devaluation of the Mark is not groundless." (Havas, 13th)</p>

<p>London – Secretary of State for War [Alfred Duff] Cooper declared during the debate on the army budget in the House of Commons today that the British Army will soon have the best anti-tank weapons in the world. The army budget for 1936 totals £49,201,000, an increase of £5,730,000 compared to last year, of which £1,555,000 is due to the special plans taken regarding the Italo-Abyssinian War. The budget does not stipulate the acceleration and expansion of defense contemplated in the recent government white paper. Cooper told the House of Commons that the Army Department has decided to adopt two new weapons: an anti-tank rifle and an anti-tank machine gun, which will be issued to the troops as soon as possible. He also said that the British Army will add two new tank battalions, and eight cavalry regiments are currently being mechanized. The existing tank brigades will be combined with the mechanized cavalry brigades to form guerrilla divisions. The infantry is also being reorganized, with three rifle battalions combined with one machine gun battalion, equipped with new anti-tank weapons and new reconnaissance vehicles. In his speech, Cooper mentioned that it is often heard that if Britain participates in a European war again, it should only assist with its navy and air force. Although it would greatly relieve the Army Council if this could be decided early, those responsible for the army believe that they can hardly proceed on any such conjecture. He said he could not determine whether Britain would not send a well-equipped army to Europe on very short notice in a future war. If Britain participates in a European war, it should support the policy advocated by the majority of the British people, namely collective security. If Britain’s assistance is indeed limited to naval and air force warfare, then other partners in the collective security system will be greatly disappointed. A Member of Parliament asked if British forces could be deployed to Europe in time to assist a country under aggression. Cooper replied that this could be answered in two ways: if any country that Britain needs to assist knows that Britain will send a large army to help, it will have a great impact on the country’s entire military strategy at the beginning of the war and make the country’s fighting spirit stronger. The speed of mobilization of land forces is constantly increasing. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<p>Paris – Following the Chamber of Deputies, the Senate approved the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty by a vote of 233 to 52. The treaty will take effect as soon as it is signed by the President. At the meeting today, Senator Bérenger, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, first stood up to speak, urging senators to immediately reject motions to postpone the discussion, as opponents of the treaty may propose such motions, and said that the treaty should be approved immediately after German Chancellor [Adolf] Hitler abrogated the Locarno Treaty. Subsequently, senators opposed to the treaty spoke one after another, explaining the reasons why they could not approve it.

<p>Berlin – A spokesman for the German Propaganda Department told an Associated Press reporter today that there are only 30,000 German troops currently in the Rhineland, of which 11,000 were originally police officers who have now been reorganized and whose uniforms are no different from those of the Wehrmacht. In addition, there are 19 battalions of infantry and 13 battalions of artillery. He continued, saying that before the Great War, there were 150,000 troops stationed in this area. However, according to reliable diplomatic estimates, the German troops currently occupying the Rhineland number at least between 50,000 and 60,000, while external estimates say it has reached 250,000, as that would also include the Stormtroopers and Labour Corps. However, the spokesman laughed at this as nonsense. (Guomin, 13th)</p>

<h3 id="e33">Japan's Diplomacy Toward China and Russia: Backed by Military Force, Actively Advancing the Continental Policy Step by Step; Military Demands Five Items to Urge Cabinet Implementation <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, Jiji Newspaper reported this morning that the Hirota Cabinet's basic diplomatic policy will undoubtedly be the implementation of an independent and active continental policy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also believes that the background of this policy is the enhancement of national defense, and it agrees to focus on Japan's military preparations in Manchuria. Although there are fears that Japan's international relations will be disturbed by this, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that without this policy, there will be no way to adjust Japan's relations with Russia and China. Since Soviet Russia has not expressed its intention to withdraw its Far East military preparations, the Japanese government has no choice but to consider increasing its troop strength in Manchuria to match the strength of the Russian army in the Far East in order to prevent border disputes and adjust the relationship between Japan, "Manchuria," and Russia. It is expected that this policy will change China's attitude toward Japan. The Jiji Newspaper also mentioned Sino-Japanese relations, saying that there is now a need to make the world recognize Japan's political and economic interests in China, which inevitably conflict with British and American interests. This is because British and American interests in China are only related to economic expansion and development, while Japan's interests in China are necessary for the survival of the Japanese people and indispensable for the development of the Japanese nation. Therefore, Japan must create a situation in which British and American economic interests in China must be expanded only after obtaining Japan's understanding. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>Tokyo, The new cabinet's program and policies are scheduled to be decided and announced at today's regular cabinet meeting. In view of the great impact of this statement both internally and externally, a cautious attitude has been adopted. At today's cabinet meeting, Baba, chairman of the policy proposal drafting committee, will report on the research process. Currently, only the policy programs submitted by the various ministries are being reviewed. After the draft decision is submitted and passed at the regular cabinet meeting on the 17th, it will be approved and announced on the same day. (Dentsu dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>The army authorities plan to incorporate policies that have been studied for many years into the demands to be implemented by the Hirota Cabinet. The specific contents are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>"Establish a guiding spirit for determining national policy." Since the Manchurian Incident, Japan's international status has risen, and the entire nation has entered an era of great advancement. However, political, economic, and other systems still maintain their old state. Internal and external policies have been passive and regressive until today. Now that the new cabinet has been established, it should adopt a new spirit, abandon the attitude of maintaining the status quo or being passive, and reform various policies to establish active policies in order to develop national fortunes.</p>
<p>"Substantial national defense and adjust national defense capabilities." To seek trade development and establish overseas markets, it is necessary to first strengthen national defense to avoid being intimidated by other countries, which is an absolute prerequisite. Therefore, based on Japan's current objective situation and the situations it will inevitably encounter in the future, it is necessary to establish maximum national defense capabilities with minimum military expenditures. For this purpose, establish the fundamentals of national policy, and the army and navy should cooperate to allow the organic performance of national defense capabilities to operate freely.</p>
<p>"Establish diplomatic policies and adjust the fundamentals of national policy and national defense capabilities. At the same time, actively use foreign policies as an urgent task at present."</p>
<p>"Decisively reform the administrative structure." Renovate the administrative structure and eliminate the departmentalism of various ministries. This will nurture national strength and stabilize the lives of the people. If necessary, implement the abolition or merger of various ministries, and limit the number of state ministers to a small number whose mission is to implement national policy, while officials in each ministry manage routine affairs.</p>
<p>"Decisively implement tax increases and reform the economic structure. It is absolutely necessary to reorganize the tax system to ensure the average burden on the people. In the future, as national expenditures expand, it will be unavoidable to decisively implement tax increases to make up for the lack of revenue. However, the method and timing of its implementation must be carefully considered. In addition, the unreasonable and unrestrained economic structure should be given considerable rationalization, reform, and control, otherwise all national policies will become empty words.

<p>Berlin, The German Far Eastern Society hosted a banquet for Chinese Ambassador Cheng Tianfang at the Deutsches Herrenklub last night. In addition to the members of the society, there were also important members of the Nazi Party, cabinet ministers, officials from the Chinese Embassy, and well-known figures from the domestic business, literary, and scientific communities, such as Rosenberg, the head of the Foreign Policy Department of the Nazi Party, and Privy Council Advisor Kassenberger. The meeting began with a speech by the Vice-Chairman of the Society, Lindt, who said that in the history of Sino-German diplomacy, he was able to welcome the Chinese Ambassador and it was a joy for us not only because China and Germany have exchanged envoys but also because during the current period of political disputes, it has had no impact on the two countries. Therefore, from now on, the two countries should only strive for economic and cultural advancement.</p>
<p>Ambassador Cheng replied that although he had only been in Berlin for seven weeks, he had been interested in Germany for a long time.

<p>— Xingcun</p>
<p>Factors Affecting Insect Occurrence Insect occurrence</p>
<p>is always limited by environmental factors. Some say that the factors affecting</p>
<p>insect occurrence belong to the climate aspect.</p>
<p>Generally, people believe that the number of insects occurring in a certain period</p>
<p>depends entirely on whether the climate is suitable or not. Others</p>
<p>say that the factors limiting insect occurrence are biological aspects,</p>
<p>that is, the number of insects occurring depends entirely on</p>
<p>the number of natural enemies. The so-called natural enemies include</p>
<p>beneficial birds, beneficial insects, and beneficial animals, all of which</p>
<p>use pests as food. When talking about biological factors, we</p>
<p>think of a "natural balance" phenomenon in nature.</p>
<p>That is, nature often maintains a certain number of</p>
<p>animals to prevent them from suddenly increasing. For example,</p>
<p>there is often a pest that, in its place of origin, is able to maintain natural</p>
<p>balance and not cause great harm due to the limitations of parasitic</p>
<p>insects or other natural enemies. Once it leaves its</p>
<p>place of origin and moves to another place, then in the new environment,</p>
<p>due to the lack of natural enemies, it cannot maintain natural</p>
<p>balance. As a result, the number of individuals increases sharply and becomes a major problem.</p>
<p>Modern economic entomologists are advocating the biological pest</p>
<p>control method, that is, using this method to implement insect control</p>
<p>by insects, often introducing the natural enemies of pests</p>
<p>from very far away to kill pests. Pest control in various countries</p>
<p>has also achieved considerable success in this aspect.</p>
<p>The Periodicity of Locust Occurrence Locusts are an important pest</p>
<p>of crops in our country, but they do not cause harm every year.</p>
<p>They must be separated by several years before causing harm. Therefore, locust</p>
<p>occurrence is periodic. Entomologists have an explanation for this</p>
<p>phenomenon, that is, locusts can be divided into gregarious</p>
<p>and solitary types. These two types are not only obviously different in morphology,</p>
<p>but also have different habits. Gregarious types</p>
<p>can migrate in groups over long distances and cause great harm. This is the so-called</p>
<p>"flying locusts covering the sky." All the flying locusts that feed on crops</p>
<p>belong to this type. Solitary locusts mostly live scattered</p>
<p>and do not need to migrate in groups over long distances, so they do not cause disasters. In fact, gregarious</p>
<p>and solitary types can change interactively. When the</p>
<p>environment is suitable and food is abundant, solitary types can</p>
<p>become gregarious types. Conversely, when the environment is unsuitable and food</p>
<p>is lacking, gregarious types can also become solitary types.</p>
<p>Therefore, years in which locusts do not cause great harm do not mean that</p>
<p>there are no locusts at all during that period. However, at that time, solitary</p>
<p>locusts did not become gregarious flying locusts.</p>
<p>Pest Occurrence Prediction In pest control methods,</p>
<p>there is an ideal method that has not yet been completely successful,</p>
<p>that is, trying to predict the occurrence of pests in advance,</p>
<p>just like weather stations predict wind and rain. In this way,</p>
<p>pests can be prevented in advance and achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>However, actually predicting pest occurrence is not as</p>
<p>simple as predicting the climate, because in addition to climate factors,</p>
<p>there are also biological factors</p>
<p>affecting insect occurrence. Climate factors include temperature, rainfall, etc.</p>
<p>Therefore, entomologists, although having great</p>
<p>aspirations in this area, have not yet achieved complete success.</p>
<p>If we want to use meteorological records to predict</p>
<p>the occurrence of a pest, we must first understand the average</p>
<p>temperature and average humidity or average rainfall of the pest's occurrence area.</p>
<p>(The average for the month or the year is determined as needed.) According to the research of Mr. Cai Banghua, the striped stem borer</p>
<p>(the striped stem borer is one of the important pests in rice-producing areas in our country. During its larval stage, it specializes in drilling into the rice</p>
<p>stems and gnawing on the tissues inside the rice stems, resulting in dead heart</p>
<p>seedlings and white ears, which are extremely difficult to eliminate). In Hangzhou</p>
<p>Xianqiao, if the climate in August and September of the first year</p>
<p>is high in temperature and high in rainfall, then the number of striped</p>
<p>stem borer individuals born in the second year will definitely be very large, and the degree of harm</p>
<p>to rice will also definitely be very high. The reason is that the</p>
<p>climate with high temperature and high rainfall in August and September is extremely suitable for</p>
<p>the reproduction of striped stem borers. Therefore, striped stem borers usually</p>
<p>occur only three times in Hangzhou Xianqiao, but when this</p>
<p>type of climate occurs, it can increase to four times. Since it occurs</p>
<p>once more, the number of overwintering larvae also increases</p>
<p>accordingly. Therefore, the striped stem borer in that area in the second year shows a large-scale</p>
<p>occurrence phenomenon and becomes rampant. Therefore, if we</p>
<p>want to predict the occurrence of the striped stem borer in the second year, we can</p>
<p>create a climate map of the average temperature and average</p>
<p>rainfall recorded each month of the previous year and compare it with the climate map</p>
<p>of the normal occurrence year of the striped stem borer (that is, the year when the striped stem borer is not rampant),</p>
<p>then it will not be difficult to predict it.</p>

<p>Nanjing, General Iwane Matsui, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, visited Foreign Minister Zhang on the 12th. Zhang hosted a banquet at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at noon to welcome Matsui. They dispersed at 2:00 pm. In the afternoon at 3:00 pm, Matsui met with Chinese and foreign reporters and said that he would visit President Chiang on the 14th to pay his respects in a private meeting. He will cancel his trip to the north and take a night train to Shanghai on the 14th to wait for a ship back to China. Matsui presented reporters with his book "The Inevitability and Significance of the Asian Alliance" and said that Sino-Japanese relations are difficult to describe in the current situation. To seek a thorough solution, both China and Japan should reflect on themselves and adopt the view of being strict with themselves and lenient with others. In his observation, so far, he does not feel that there is a possibility of an unfortunate incident occurring between China and Japan. He firmly believes that the solution to the Sino-Japanese problem will be solved by the will of Heaven. This trip to China is in a private capacity, to visit the authorities of your country and state his views on the security of the Asian situation. His impressions of his inspection in the South China area can be said to be without any dissatisfaction. After coming to Nanjing, he originally planned to go to North China again, but felt that there was no need to inspect North China, so he decided to cancel it. To express his respect to the leaders of your country, he intends to visit President Chiang on the 14th for a private conversation. On the evening of the 14th, he will attend a dinner hosted by Ambassador Arita and return to Shanghai without much delay, taking a ship back to China. Finally, Matsui stated his views on the so-called Greater Asia, saying that the previous attempts to unite China and Japan failed because they lacked a broad vision and were merely stubborn and concerned with short-term interests, without thinking from the overall situation. At present, in Sino-Japanese relations, we should stand at the height of world peace and human happiness, or look down from the perspective of revitalizing Asia, abandon small differences and seek common ground, and work together. Matsui's book "Asian Alliance" is divided into six sections, all of which are his personal views, saying that Asians have their own special habits and different physiques, and no matter what, they cannot change Asianism. In the event of a Sino-Japanese dispute, we should not calculate the past and focus on revitalization together, to contribute to the construction of world peace. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>

<h3 id="e46">Legislative Yuan Holds Routine Meeting and Passes Regulations on Cracking Down on Adulteration of Water and Impurities in Cotton <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, The Legislative Yuan held its 51st meeting on the morning of the 13th, attended by 64 members, including Legislator Han Xuan and others. Sun Ke presided, and Liang Hancao was the Secretary-General. They passed the revised Provisional Regulations on Cracking Down on Adulteration of Water and Impurities in Cotton. The regulations were formulated and promulgated in July 23. Since their implementation, the National Economic Commission, based on the resolutions of the previous National Cotton Inspection Administrative Conference, believed that the original regulations still had shortcomings, such as the lack of a clear definition of the highest limit for impurities, and that mixing cotton was seriously related to the quality of cotton, such as mixing American cotton seeds into Chinese cotton seeds, resulting in mixed varieties, and mixing coarse-fiber cotton with fine-fiber cotton, causing disorder of product grades. The original regulations also lacked punitive provisions, so a revised bill was drafted and sent to the Executive Yuan, which ordered the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to review it. After the Central Political Council reviewed the opinions, it was transferred to the Legislative Yuan for review. After the Commercial Law Committee and the Economic Committee of the Legislative Yuan reviewed the bill, they revised it according to the original plan.

<p>— Zhuang Xueben</p>
<p>A separate page should be dedicated to narrating the history of our host, the Tusi Li, and his lineage of Li Keyong.</p>
<p>His ancestor was Zhu Xie Zhiyi, the chieftain of the Shatuo tribe in the Western Regions during the reign of Emperor Xianzong of the Tang Dynasty. After assisting the Tang Dynasty, his son Ping Pangdong made meritorious contributions. He was granted the name Li Guochang and made Jiedushi of Datong. He had a son, Keyong, who destroyed Huang Chao and was enfeoffed as the Prince of Jin. He had thirteen sons: commonly known as the Thirteen Taibao. His son, Cunxu, destroyed Zhu Liang and became Emperor Zhuangzong of the Later Tang Dynasty. Siyuan became Emperor Mingzong of the Later Tang Dynasty. During the Song Dynasty, his descendants Jigong and Jipeng were Jiedushi. During the Yuan Dynasty, Li Shangge was the Prince of Qi's Mansion. His son, Meidegu, was granted land at Hongyagou Beichuan Shiguanzhuang. Meidegu's son was Nange. In the Yuan Dynasty, he was the Vice Magistrate of Xining Prefecture. In the Ming Dynasty, he advanced to the rank of Commander, awarded the title of Earl of Huining posthumously. He had one son: Li Ying, Li Xiong. Li Ying was promoted to Guanglu Dafu Zhuguo, Earl of Huining for his military exploits. His descendants inherited the title of Eastern Earl's Mansion and lived in Shangchuankou, 120 miles southeast of Nianbo County. Li Xiong advanced to Ronglu Dafu Zhuguo, Earl of Gaoyang. He also inherited the title and called it the Western Earl's Mansion, living in Qitacheng, 30 miles south of Xining County. Both had land and people under their jurisdiction, with 23 Qianbabzong under them, and 23 extra deputy posts, 300 local soldiers. In the second year of the Shunzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty, Li Zhen of the Eastern Earl's Mansion and Li Tianyu of the Western Earl's Mansion surrendered simultaneously and were granted the title of Commander Tongzhi.</p>
<p>Tusi Li inherited a branch of the Eastern Earl's Mansion, so his current card still has the title "Nianbo South Hereditary Tusi Commander Tongzhi" printed on it. During the previous Qing Dynasty, the organization of the Tusi Yamen had one Qianzong, two Babzongs, four Waiwei, one hundred Qianhus, two Baihus, and 300 local soldiers. The local soldiers were based on the Tuntian system, completing orders while integrating soldiers with agriculture. Since the Republic of China, the Tusi system has been replaced by the Liuguan system, and the Tusi has lost his power; however, the people still have a hereditary respect for those in office. The former Tusi of the Western Earl's Mansion was named Li Peilin, and he currently lives in Xining.</p>
<p>After arriving at Sangsige, the first feeling was that the men's and women's clothing was more distinctive.</p>
<p>The difference in women's headdresses and men's clothing is small. They wear faceless sheepskin jackets, belts, lambskin hats, soft boots, and some have a fire pot hanging in between. However, every local also drags a long braid.</p>
<p>Women's clothing is usually a brown cloth shirt. During these few New Years, many wear a new garment with five-colored sleeves: the outer garment is a black robe, and the sleeves are made of two-inch red, yellow, blue, purple, and green cloth strips, sewn into two beautiful sleeves. The rich wear a green silk or black velvet short vest, with four large ruyi patterns inlaid on the front and back corners of the clothing. Two strings of fine, red-and-white beads are hung around the neck, with earrings hanging down to the shoulders. The shoes have double straps, made of red, yellow, and green cloth strips. Unmarried women have bald heads and wear two braids. Married women wear two types of headdresses: a three-pronged head and a dry food head.</p>
<p>The "three-pronged head" is also known as the "pointed head," with a Shagol covering the back of the head. It is connected to twenty or thirty three-inch-long copper tubes, tied into an oval shape with red rope, and a copper arrow is inserted on top; it rises about half a foot above the top of the head, with the arrowhead divided into three prongs, with two small red velvet balls hanging on it. Several red ropes are suspended from the braids, and a circular (he ga), half a foot in diameter, is dragged on the back, tilted upwards, made of red paperboard, and the front is made of five-colored beads as small as rice grains, arranged into nine-colored circles, with a white small conch shell inlaid around the outside. The "dry food head" is also known as the "sesame cake head," with a circular red paperboard, shaped like a sesame cake, inserted on the head, with the local name Tokuila. Red rope is nailed on the edge, hanging down. Tassels are used, and the back is lined with colored lace silk. A raised Chelga is also dragged on the back.</p>
<p>This type of headdress is completely different from that of Tangba Fort. Men's clothing is made of brown cloth in summer, and women wear cloth.</p>
<p>The degree of Han Chinese influence on the locals is not deep here. They have dangerous-looking faces and beautiful valleys, and their actions are very genuine. The women are petite, and the men are strong. They have not seen photography before, so when I take pictures of them, their postures are very lively and natural. A few local women who know a little cleanliness rub a red color like rouge on their already washed faces. This makes their apple-colored faces look more Kangfo and beautiful.</p>
<p>The wind here is also very lively. Leaning on the mountains on the left, there are valleys nearby. Along the road and the bank of the ditch are neat and slender white poplars, and the Pengkang at the corner of the road gives people the feeling of being in a garden. The Hongyazi Ditch is now frozen with thick ice, and a row of five or six water mills adorn the great river ditch: the creaking sound of the machines and the constantly rotating wheels are very good at stimulating the poetic mood of tourists. When the rising sun rises, and when the setting sun is about to set, women wearing five-colored clothes drive a flock of sheep and bring several livestock, walking through the woods. They shout by the riverside! The calls of cattle and sheep drinking water, the golden waves are shaking, and the heavy father leisurely returns to the forest. A row of women carrying water buckets appear by the river one after another, chatting and laughing, the sunlight shining on their hat crowns, coming and going endlessly, until the sun rises three poles high, or the new moon is in the forest, and their shadows also disappear with it.</p>
<p>One Yuan per Mu of Land</p>
<p>The lives of the locals are characterized by female diligence and male laziness. During these few New Year's days, the men do even less work, idling around in the courtyards all day long. Although the women should also rest and enjoy themselves, they are still busy carrying water, carrying manure, herding sheep, and collecting cow dung all day long.</p>
<p>The local customs are purer here; therefore, they carry water like the Westerners. A tall bucket is tied with two ropes, the ropes are placed on the left and right shoulders, and the water bucket stands steadily on the back.</p>
<p>Their dwellings also have two-story buildings.</p>
<p>They are all very struggling economically, and there is even less cash in circulation. Few well-off locals can take out ten silver dollars from their homes. The interest rate they borrow from the lamas is as high as 5%.</p>
<p>The terrain is 2,840 meters high. The climate in the valley is relatively warm, and crops can be planted after Qingming. There are a total of thirty households in the village, and Han Chinese account for one-tenth of them. Most of them also grow a few dou of crops and raise a few sheep.</p>
<p>Most of them are self-sufficient, so prices are very low; land is one yuan per mu, and the highest is no more than six yuan, horses are twenty to one hundred yuan. Mules are around one hundred yuan, cattle are ten to twenty yuan. Sheep are two yuan. Pigs are six yuan, green fruits are one yuan per dou. Wheat is one yuan five jiao per dou. Beans are two yuan per dou.</p>
<p>Marriage at Seven Years Old</p>
<p>Marriage customs are more free here than in other places. Usually, if a man and woman are in love, they give gifts and worship heaven and earth, and they can formally become husband and wife.</p>
<p>However, authoritarian marriage is still prevalent. Well-off families practice the system of young husbands and old wives, often marrying a seven or eight-year-old child to a twenty-year-old daughter-in-law. Because the local women are diligent in labor and the men are idle and do not engage in production, the purpose of the young husband and old wife system is not to have children, but to help the husband's family manage agricultural affairs. This type of daughter-in-law does not worship in the hall when she comes through the door. Only the husband's family pays the wedding gift.</p>
<p>The wedding gift is sent to the woman's family before the formal marriage: one horse, one cow, one hybrid cow, ten bolts of brown cloth, sixteen pieces of cloth, and eighty strings of money. Depending on the wealth of the man's family, the wedding gift may be slightly increased or decreased.</p>
<p>For the wedding, the Lama chooses an auspicious day to pick up the bride. Enter the kitchen, wear a dry food head or a two-pronged head, the husband and wife worship the hall, relatives sit around the courtyard and drink and chat.</p>
<p>The conclusion of their marriages does not take into account bloodlines or seniority. Close relatives are not allowed. It is also very common for widows to remarry. There are very few marriages between Han Chinese and locals. When there are, it is only locals marrying Han Chinese.</p>
<p>Because the wedding gifts demanded by the woman's family are very heavy, many poor men never have a wife in their lives. Many women are also unable to marry and die old in their mother's homes. Sex is inevitable for bachelors and spinsters. Because their sexual problems are very public, things like running away together become much less common.</p>
<p>Fifteen-Year-Old Ah Gu</p>
<p>When unmarried women reach the age of fifteen, they kneel down to their parents, heaven and earth, and connect the ends of the two braids on their back, and they are called "wearing the heaven head." From then on, they are envied and called "Ah Gu."</p>
<p>"Ah Gu" can enjoy the right to freedom in love. Parents and siblings cannot interfere. She is still working in her mother's house anyway. It is very free for Ah Gu to find a lover outside or bring a lover home. If she brings a man of good reputation home, her parents and siblings are also willing to help her entertain him. If Ah Gu has children, they are considered children of the mother's family, and have the mother's family name, and Ah Gu will die old in her mother's family. If Ah Gu's lover gives a wedding gift and takes her away, it is up to her whether she wants to take the children with her or not. The children who are not taken are regarded as descendants of the maternal family.</p>
<p>There are also a small number of Ah Gu who, because they have too many lovers, are unable to extricate themselves from the sea of love. They wear a headdress and live in their mother's home in order to cope with it. Therefore, there are indeed many bachelors and spinsters among the locals who do not marry, but in fact most of them are neither bachelors nor spinsters.</p>
<p>It is said that their local lascivious atmosphere is because there are two mountains in Ledu County in front, and a stream flows between them that looks too much like a woman's private parts, so it has destroyed their feng shui.</p>
<p>When a man decides on a wife, he sends the wedding gift over, and the woman's family accepts it: her lover will make him a silk collar, embroidered with beautiful patterns of red and green silk threads and purple copper wire, and sew it on her fiancé's brown cloth clothing to show that it is a gift of their engagement. So, if you want to know whether a young man is engaged or not, you just need to see if he has a flower collar around his neck.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Inland and Foreign Goods Intermodal Transportation Set to Commence on May 1st <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Regarding the intermodal transportation of goods between inland and foreign territories, following the realization of the railway traffic, the Japanese side had hoped to continue its implementation. However, both sides were engaged in negotiations and discussions. After Yin Tong was appointed as Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, he went to Dalian to discuss the details with the Kwantung Army and the South Manchuria Railway Company, seeking to reconcile opinions. No immediate agreement was reached. Last year, after Takeshita Yoshii succeeded Ise Makoto as the chief of the Kwantung Army's Yuguan Special Service Organ, he also strove to revive the matter. Usami Hiroshi, the Director of the Railway Department of the South Manchuria Railway, came to Pingjin last winter to promote the issue, but ultimately, due to numerous complexities, it was difficult to realize. Recently, the Beining Railway Bureau, the South Manchuria Railway Bureau, and relevant parties of the Kwantung Railway General Bureau, feeling the practical needs, have taken a business-oriented stance and jointly sought technical cooperation. Previously, Usami Hiroshi, Director of the South Manchuria Railway and concurrently Director of the Railway General Bureau, dispatched Sakai Seibei as a representative to Tianjin to negotiate a compromise with Chen Juesheng, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau. On March 6th, at 10 a.m., at the Beining Reception Office on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession of Tianjin, they, along with Takeshita, the chief of the Yuguan Special Service Organ, who was also present, concluded an intermodal transportation agreement and supplementary articles regarding account settlement, etc. It is scheduled to commence on May 1st. According to the Beining Railway Bureau, the agreement was based on principled discussions, so the results obtained are considered satisfactory. The essential points of the intermodal transportation agreement are recorded below:</p>
<p>*   This intermodal transportation of goods is limited to the lines of the Chinese state-owned Beining Railway, the South Manchuria Railway Company, and the Kwantung Railway General Bureau. The names of the stations that handle this intermodal transportation of goods will be announced by both parties.</p>
<p>*   For both full carload and less-than-full carload shipments accepted for this intermodal transportation of goods, the railway will be responsible. A waybill or delivery order will be issued at the originating station and will be valid directly to the destination station, without the need for re-ticketing at each connecting railway. All goods passing through Shanhaiguan Station will generally be transferred at that station, unloaded by the delivering railway and loaded by the receiving railway. The freight charges will be calculated according to the tariff rates of each railway, and the regulations of each railway will apply separately.</p>
<p>*   The formats of all required waybills, delivery orders, and other documents, as well as procedures for customs declaration and tax payment on behalf of merchants, advance payment of miscellaneous fees, currency exchange rates, and the settlement of accounts and disbursement of payments between the railways, have been determined in the "Intermodal Transportation Goods Account Settlement Method" and will be handled accordingly. Regarding direct communication between China and Japan, preparations are being actively made. More than ten telegraph operators have been transferred from the Ministry to Tianjin. Now that the ice has melted at Dagu and ships can enter the port, the equipment will be transported here within days. After installation and successful testing, telegrams between Tokyo and Tianjin can be sent directly without having to be relayed through the Shanghai International Radio Station, which is much more convenient than before.

<h3 id="e83">Hangzhou Banking and Financial Industries Oppose Reorganization of Zhejiang Province's Debt - Issuance of New Provincial Bonds to Redeem Old Debts, Reduce Interest Rates, and Extend Repayment Periods <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Hangzhou Dispatch: Cheng Yuanfan, the Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance, believes that the province's finances have reached a state of extreme difficulty. The provincial treasury owes more than 50 million yuan, and the principal and interest payments due each year exceed 5 million yuan, accounting for one-quarter of the province's income. Therefore, in order to reorganize the finances, it is necessary to start with the reorganization of debts. He has formulated a plan to reissue a large amount of public bonds, redeem the existing provincial public bonds, reduce interest rates, and extend the repayment period to ease the debt burden. The Hangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Banking and Financial Industry Association believe that this move affects the interests of merchants themselves and have submitted petitions to the provincial government requesting that the original plan not be changed and that the bonds be maintained. The banking and financial industries also convened a joint meeting and resolved to send a telegram to the central government's various departments and the Zhejiang Provincial Government to maintain credit and contracts. The original telegram stated: "An investigation reveals that Zhejiang Province has issued seven types of bonds: bonds for repaying old debts, highway bonds, construction bonds, disaster relief bonds, clearing old debts, provincial treasury bills, and local bonds. The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance has borrowed more than 11 million yuan from the banking and financial industries. Recently, it has been rumored that the Department of Finance intends to reduce interest rates and extend the principal repayment periods for various bonds and change the contracts for various loans. Public sentiment is anxious and unsettled. If this is not just a rumor and actually comes to pass, the social economy will be disrupted and panic will arise. The Association, being responsible for Zhejiang's finances, and considering the current market downturn, must present the situation that Zhejiang's bonds cannot be reorganized and various loans cannot have their contracts changed.</p>
<p>Regarding public bonds, the current Zhejiang provincial bonds are divided into three categories: The first is the reorganization case, which includes the repayment of highway construction, revitalization, and clearing of public bonds. The second is the provincial treasury case, the twenty-first Zhejiang provincial treasury bills. The third is the local bond case, the twenty-third Zhejiang provincial local bonds. The issuance of all bonds, whether solicited from the public based on the face value of the bond, or mortgaged against debts owed to the banking and financial industries, all designate provincial tax revenue as the fund. The bond fund listed in the provincial budget for the twentieth year was 8,001,400 yuan. Even with the shortfall in tax revenue and the expenditure of collection fees, it is more than sufficient to pay the principal and interest on the various bonds in the twenty-fourth year, which amounted to 5,428,600 yuan, and therefore cannot be reorganized.</p>
<p>Regarding loans, the Department of Finance has borrowed from the banking and financial industries in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places over the years. As of November 11th of the twenty-fourth year, the total outstanding amount was 11,125,399 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen, 1 li, with various bonds as collateral for more than nine-tenths of the total amount. Investigations show that some loans have been partially repaid, while others have not been repaid at all, but all have contractual relationships. According to legal principles, no party may arbitrarily change them. Even early repayment requires the consent of the lender. If the government does not understand the difficulties of merchants and takes extraordinary measures, the capital on which finance relies for circulation will inevitably be severely damaged. The impact on operators is small, but the hindrance to the social credit system is great. The banking and financial industries, in order to maintain the normal interlocking relationship between finance and finance, absolutely cannot accept any plans to change the original plan. We should respectfully consider the capital of the bondholders and the credit of the contracts, fulfill the sincerity of the original plan, make a clear announcement, so as to dispel public doubts and show great faith. However, regarding this case, the Director of Finance, Cheng Yuanfan, has twice gone to Beijing to consult with the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance. As soon as there are concrete results from the discussion, the reorganization plan can be announced and implemented. It is said that reorganizing Zhejiang's debt is a necessary fact for the finances. Both the central and local authorities have long had this intention, so this case is inevitable. The opposition from the banking and financial industries may not be effective. (March 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Guangdong Province Actively Consolidates the Defense of the Eastern Border of Chaozhou and Meizhou <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: The counties of Chaozhou and Meizhou in the eastern Guangdong region are adjacent to the border of Fujian and are an important area for national and provincial defense. The Guangdong authorities have repeatedly received information from various sources that the leaders of the civilian army along the coastal areas of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in southern Fujian have recently received support and guidance from a certain party, forming a "Great Alliance," advocating "Fujian Autonomy," and that a pseudo-autonomous government and autonomous army are already brewing. Commander-in-Chief Chen of the Guangdong Army specially summoned the military officers stationed in the eastern region, Li Yangjing, Li Hanhun, Huang Yanzhen, and others, to a meeting at his private residence in Meiyuan Village on the 5th to discuss suppressing bandits and consolidating the eastern border. Jiang Dingwen, the Pacification Director of Fujian Province, expressed concern about the security of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou. It is reported that on the 7th of this month, he cracked down on secret organizations of traitors in Zhangzhou and Xiamen. In addition to reporting to the highest officials to quickly determine a national defense strategy, he also informed the authorities and ordered the garrison in Chaoshan to take strict precautions. Huang Renhuan, the commander of the Independent First Division, gave a speech to the military officers in Jiaoling on the 7th, stating that, according to the order of the headquarters, all officers and soldiers, whether at the front or in the rear, are not allowed to take leave at this time. Those who have already taken leave must return to their posts within five days from the date of the announcement in order to maintain their duties. The border defense of Chaozhou, Meizhou, Fujian, and Jiangxi has become tense in recent days.</p>
<p>Major General Hirata, a military attaché from Japan, and Commander Hosogaya of the Fifth Torpedo Squadron arrived in Shantou aboard the flagship "Yubari" on the 3rd and were warmly welcomed by the Japanese consul and the chairman of the residents' association. It is said that Hirata's visit to the south is to comfort Japanese warships stationed at ports in southern China and to inspect Japanese and Taiwanese residents, but the content is not so simple. On the 4th, two military attachés from Japan stationed in Guangdong, Major Taihei Hideo and Captain Ogawa Kanji, arrived in Shantou via the Dongjiang First Trunk Line. A platoon leader of the Guangdong Chen's constabulary led twelve constables to escort them along the way. After the two military attachés arrived in Shantou on the 4th, Japanese consul's office, naval, and army officers had a very important meeting. The content is not known to outsiders. On the same day, Hirata, Hosogaya, and the captains of the "Asagao" and "Fuyou," both anchored in Shantou, attended the meeting. After the meeting, at 2 p.m., the captains of the "Fuyou" and "Asagao," accompanied by Oburo, a clerk from the Japanese consulate, went to the Public Security Bureau to see Song Dejian, the Director of the bureau. They had a secret conversation in the Director's office for two hours. It is said that the conversation was about the death of patrolman Kakuda Susumu on the 21st of last month. The Japanese side, under the pretext of protecting its residents, demanded to increase the number of Japanese consulate police to assist the Shantou Public Security Bureau in maintaining public order. The outcome is not known to the outside world. On the 5th, Hirata, Hosogaya, Taihei, Ogawa, the Japanese Consul Harada, and 18 key members from the "Yubari," "Fuyou," and "Asagao" and the army and navy, were led by Huang Muyi (a Taiwanese), the financial backer of the Xinghua Foreign Firm on Yushan Street, to visit Chaoan City. They left in the morning and returned in the evening. All famous scenic spots inside and outside Chaoan, as well as important transportation hubs on the roads and waterways, were thoroughly surveyed. On the evening of the 5th, Hirata and others took the "Yubari" to Xiamen, while Taihei and Ogawa remained in Shantou, residing in the Huashang Hotel in Tongyi West Lane. Those who frequent this hotel are leaders of a certain province from Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Shantou, and are closely watched by Chaozhou, Shantou, and military and police authorities. A certain leader who came to Shantou from Taiwan, Fuzhou, and Xiamen hosted a banquet for Taihei and others, which often lasted all night. The extent of their busyness can be imagined. On the 6th, Taihei claimed that he wanted to travel to Fengshun and Meizhou, and return to the province via the upper reaches of the Dongjiang River. Liang Shiying, the platoon leader of the constabulary who escorted them to Shantou, dissuaded him. On the 7th, Taihei and others again wanted to take a bus to Chenghai Xiaoping Huanggang, and go to Xiamen via Zhao'an, notifying the municipal government to transfer to the East District Office to protect their travels in various places, but they were persuaded by the mayor to give up. The Japanese military officials are touring the interior during this freezing weather and drizzle, their interest is not superficial. The reader can understand their intentions.</p>
<h3 id="e85">The Case of Zhang Wei: Murderer Chen Juncen Commits Suicide in Prison - Han Fuqu Cables Report to the Central Government - <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: On January 2nd of last year, the Provincial New Life Movement Promotion Association convened a lantern festival, using the New Year opportunity to conduct expanded publicity. That evening, at the Jinde Hall, amidst the bright lights and bustling crowds, Zhang Weicun, a Central Committee member, Standing Committee member of the Shandong Provincial Party Headquarters, and member of the Shandong Provincial Government, was shot and killed. At the time, military police thoroughly searched the Jinde Hall but found nothing. Subsequently, the provincial government offered a reward for the capture of the murderer. Finally, on the 4th of that month, the murderer, Chen Juncen, was apprehended. Chen was the director of the Special Affairs Office of the Provincial Party Headquarters (i.e., the anti-communist squad leader). The firearms, bullets, and circumstances before and after the incident provided irrefutable evidence, and Chen also confessed. He was detained in a well-appointed room within the prisoner holding area. The details of the case were recorded in the newspapers at the time. Now, more than a year has passed, and the prisoner lived freely. Unexpectedly, at one o'clock in the morning on the 10th, he used his belt to hang himself. Because it was late at night, by the time he was discovered, it was too late to save him, and he died. The military judge stationed at the prisoner holding area, Lu Angbin, reported the incident. Subsequently, the Third Route Army Headquarters dispatched military judge Yuan Daotian, along with Chen Qinglan, a forensic examiner from the Jinan District Court, to the scene to conduct a detailed examination. The deceased was 37 years old, originally from Anhua County, Hunan Province. It was confirmed that he had died by hanging, with a cloth belt mark around his throat. There were no other injuries. An autopsy report was completed, and a coffin was prepared to enshroud the body, which was temporarily placed in the City God Temple, awaiting family members to claim it for burial. Chairman Han has already telegraphed the situation of the prisoner's suicide to President Jiang of the Central Executive Yuan for review.</p>
<p>New Commissioner Assumes Office: Zhu Jiwu, the newly appointed special commissioner for opium cases in this county, arrived in Songjiang on the 12th and went to the county government to assume his duties.</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>On the 13th, during the trial of an opium case, the police were first ordered to bring Qian Jide, a private opium smoker held in custody, to court. Because he was seriously ill, a request was made to release him on bail. When being brought from the prison and passing in front of the County Court, he collapsed and died. The incident was immediately reported to the county government. After reviewing the records, it was found that the opium addict was from Jinshanwei. He was arrested and imprisoned in November of last year. He became seriously ill in prison, and his brother offered bail, which was approved for him to be summoned and released, but he unfortunately died halfway.</p>

<p>Changzhou Land Registration Deadline</p>
<p>Wang Weizu, the director of the Wuyi Land Bureau, recently received an order from the Provincial Land Bureau stating that all land registration matters in the entire county must be completed by the end of December of this year. He immediately instructed his subordinates to expedite the process. It is estimated that each of the ten districts in the county, except for those that have already completed registration, can be completed in one month, allowing them to meet the deadline. The Benniu, Sanyi, and Qinhe townships, among others, which are currently being processed, are being surveyed by supervisors Ma Yuanchao and others, in conjunction with local figures, and the work is nearing completion. Land registration began simultaneously yesterday. Additionally, the Provincial Bureau has assigned registrar Mao Junbaidi to Changzhou to assist, and he has also been assigned to various townships. Due to the complex terrain, the household surveying in the urban area is more difficult to handle, and it is planned to be expedited after the township areas are completed.</p>
<p>Yangzhou Postman Runs Away with Large Sum of Money</p>
<p>The postal service in Touqiao Town, Third District of Jiangdu, was originally handled by Jiao Yuantai General Store. Last spring, it was converted into a third-class post office. The Postal Administration sent postal worker Ge to serve as the postmaster and take over the postal affairs of Touqiao. Because Jiao Bingchun, the owner of Jiao Yuantai, had been handling the business for many years and had made achievements, his son, Ming-san, was recommended for the examination and passed. He was assigned to the Laoyao area as a postman. A Mr. Lu from Nanjing provided a written guarantee of 200 yuan. However, Jiao Mingsan absconded with 1,000 yuan from the post office. In addition to reporting the incident to the Postal Administration for a warrant and ordering the guarantor to compensate according to the guarantee, the postmaster was given a demerit. Yesterday (the 10th), the Jiangdu County Government was instructed to summon his father, Jiao Bingchun, to recover the embezzled funds.</p>
<p>Arbor Day Rescheduled</p>
<p>All circles in Jiangdu gathered at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall of the County Party Headquarters on the morning of the 12th to hold a memorial meeting for the 11th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death. More than 200 people attended. Chairman Yu Peiren led the ceremony, and Construction Bureau Director Shu Guohua reported that County Magistrate Ma was unable to attend due to official business, and sent his representative to attend and give a speech on tree planting as one of the seven major movements. He mentioned that the three northeastern provinces have the most forests in China, but they are unfortunately occupied by the Japanese. The number of forests in Fujian and Jiangxi are relatively low, creating a current great need. More than 30 million yuan is spent on importing Douglas fir and Russian pine each year. This year, the county has purchased more than 170,000 seedlings, allocating 140,000 seedlings to the eighth and ninth districts, 12,500 seedlings to the dikes, and the rest for use during the Arbor Day ceremony. Today (the 12th), due to cloudy weather, tree planting will be rescheduled for Sunday. He hopes that representatives from all walks of life will inform the public about the importance of afforestation and treat tree planting as important as growing grain. Afterwards, slogans were chanted, music was played, and the ceremony concluded.</p>
<p>All Staff of Canal Works Bureau Must Postpone Relocation</p>
<p>Xu Dingkang, the director of the Jiangbei Canal Works Bureau, originally planned to relocate all staff of the bureau to Huaiyin around the 18th, using the building originally established by the HuaiPi Section Office in Qingjiangpu as the bureau's office. The documents and tools had already been transported to Huaiyin. However, it has recently been learned that the Canal Works Bureau site in Qingjiang is difficult to give to this bureau for office use due to the special relationship of the HuaiPi Section Office. Therefore, the plan to relocate all staff to Huaiyin around the 18th is difficult to realize.</p>
<p>Trial of Murder Case of Yu Dong Woman Concludes in Nantong</p>
<p>Wang, the wife of Gu Decong from Yu Dong, had an affair with Gu Haitao, who lived in the same house. Unexpectedly, her mother-in-law discovered the affair. Out of embarrassment, the adulterous couple strangled the old woman to death and buried the body in the field. Gu Decong returned home and could not find his mother. Seeing bloodstains on the bedding, he became suspicious and reported the incident to the authorities. The prosecutor detained the two suspects and interrogated them, and the body was exhumed. They confessed to the crime and were prosecuted with the death penalty. Yesterday, Judge Hong of the Criminal Court conducted a trial. Gu Wang and Gu Haitao both retracted their confessions, but the evidence was conclusive. The trial concluded, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 18th.</p>
<p>The educational and charitable institutions in Nantong are large in scale, but have recently experienced extremely difficult financial circumstances and are difficult to maintain. Since the death of Zhang Xiaoruo, Zhang Jingli has been appointed to preside over the General Management Office. Zhang has returned to Nantong from Shanghai and has been inviting members Bao Sun Zijing and Wu Mingjie to conduct preliminary inspections. A meeting was held on the 12th to decide on important issues such as personnel and funding for each institution, in order to find a thorough solution.</p>

It has been decided that traffic will resume on the 16th of this month to facilitate travel.</p>

However, yesterday (the 9th), Lijie was cleaning his gun when it accidentally went off, and the bullet hit his wife Zhou in the head, causing her to bleed profusely and collapse to the ground. The scene was tragic. The deceased's mother, Zhou Duan, believed that Lijie had intentionally killed her daughter and reported the case to the county government to seek justice for her daughter. Fang Lijie knew that he had accidentally caused death, and has already surrendered himself to the authorities, requesting that he be dealt with according to the law.</p>

<p>Large-Scale Turmoil at Danghu Girls' School in Pinghu</p>
<p>Since the principal of Danghu Girls' School in this county, Zhang, resigned, it has been difficult to find a replacement for a while. The Education Section has been temporarily acting as principal. Two ladies, wives of other section chiefs, were hired as full-time teachers. One of them, surnamed Liu, is from Sichuan, and her accent is difficult to understand. There was a misunderstanding where she used a teaching whip to beat a student, causing a small disturbance, which was fortunately quelled. The day before yesterday, Liu had a quarrel with another teacher, Xi. Xi left in anger, and the students tried to persuade her to stay. Liu then had a conflict with the students. Crowds gathered outside the school. The acting principal, Qiao, received a phone call and brought police officers to the school to drive the students into the courtyard and monitor them. It was not until after 8 PM that Wu Shouzhen, the secretary of the county government, came to investigate and release them. It is rumored that when Qiao arrived at the school, he scolded the female students as communists and reactionaries, causing the general public to feel resentful. There will be protests within days. The students are distributing crying appeals in the streets in groups of two and three, and the turmoil is just beginning.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Security Headquarters, upon the transfer of Liao Weiliang, Cheng Lidao, Chen Debiao, Wang Wansheng, and other four individuals who were transporting red pills and opium, by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, ordered an investigation.

<p>Rules for Silver Management</p>
<p>Continue to process in accordance with previous instructions. The National Federation of Commerce, at the request of representatives of the silver industry, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance on the second of this month to request approval to amend the rules for silver management. The Federation received a reply from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, Qian Zi No. 8849, stating, "Your telegram dated the winter of March 25th regarding the request of representatives of the national silver industry, Ran Xizhang, and others to amend the rules for silver management has been received. This case has already been submitted directly by the representatives and a request has been made to the Ministry. The Ministry believes that the rules for silver management promulgated by the Ministry are intended to control the use of silver, reduce the raw material costs of silver products, and promote the improvement of manual techniques. While implementing the government's consolidation policies, there is still an intention to safeguard the industry. As for the rule that the addition of pure silver must not exceed 30%, after detailed research, the Ministry ordered the Central Mint to allocate and use materials containing more alloy components, which does not hinder manual techniques. The previous instructions of the Ministry should still be followed and purchased faithfully." You are hereby notified.</p>

Regarding the non-compliance of attendance from the 20th District Branch, the decision was made to send a letter to the branch. Regarding the letter from the 26th District Branch proposing an increase in Chinese directors and committee members to equalize Chinese municipal power in the settlement, the decision was made to send a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association to propose a discussion on the increase.

<p>Re-Urging the Ratepayers' Association to Convene a Meeting</p>
<p>The Special District Citizens' Federation yesterday again sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association in the settlement, urging it to promptly convene a ratepayers' meeting to resolve the telephone price increase issue. The original letter stated: "Dear Sirs, Since the implementation of the new Shanghai Telephone Company fee system, the market has been greatly affected, and commerce is in a state of irretrievable decline. We believe that telephones, as a corporate enterprise and a tool for communication, should share weal and woe with users, striving for widespread impact. However, commercial companies are not considering this, but instead use their exclusive operating contract as a shield, engaging in exploitation and restricting commerce and hindering transportation, which is incomprehensible. We have read in the newspaper that Executive Committee members of your association, such as Xie Xiaochu, have jointly proposed convening a representative meeting to discuss and resolve the telephone fee issue. At the same time, we received a letter from the brothel industry in the foreign concession, requesting assistance. After submitting it to the 15th Executive Committee for discussion, it was concluded that the decision by the Shanghai Municipal Council to approve the Shanghai Telephone Company's price increase was a serious violation of public opinion, and the attending Chinese directors abandoned their position as representatives of the ratepayers, which is also inappropriate. However, since this measure has already been implemented, if relief is not promptly sought, the future will be even more dire. Your esteemed association is the general organization for Chinese ratepayers in the settlement. If this issue is not vigorously contested, it will be difficult to dispel external doubts. Now that the situation is such, and your Executive Committee members have also spoken out righteously, advocating for submission to the ratepayers' meeting for resolution, our association believes that this view is deeply in line with the consensus of ratepayers. Therefore, we are specially conveying this decision by letter, urging you to promptly convene a ratepayers' meeting to seek thorough relief. If this is still ignored, it will disappoint the expectations of the ratepayers. We are sending this letter specifically in the hope that you will investigate and respond accordingly."</p>
<p>The Telephone Committee Re-Plans Its Response</p>
<p>The Special District Telephone Issue Committee has recently received letters from various sectors requesting a prompt and effective response to the telephone issue. In order to discuss practical measures, the committee has scheduled its 5th Board Meeting for 2:00 PM on the 16th of this month, inviting representatives from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the Lawyers' Association, the Accountants' Association, the Local Association, and other important organizations to participate and jointly discuss solutions.

<p>The Shanghai Timber Industry Association submitted a request to the Municipal Party Headquarters for protection regarding the detention of Chen Qizhang, manager of the Futai Timber Company, by the Zhabei Collection Office of the Municipal Finance Bureau. The submission was published in this newspaper on the 12th of this month. According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce also submitted a request to the municipal government yesterday, following the letter from the Timber Industry Association on the 11th of this month. Except for the original letter, which is omitted here, the letter stated: "The main point of this case is that the Municipal North Collection Office, in pursuing tax arrears, should not have detained Chen Qizhang, manager of the Futai Timber Company, for 28 hours, taking fingerprints and photos, as if he were a major thief, until the industry jointly provided a guarantee before releasing him. Tax arrears are only a financial matter. Since the company has assets available for execution, there is no reason to restrict the person's personal freedom. Even in terms of court enforcement of debts, it is not customary to detain a person if there are assets available for compulsory execution. Even according to Article 6, Paragraph 1 of the Administrative Enforcement Law, there is a similar restriction. This case does not apply to direct compulsory measures against a person. The collection office's practice of detaining people as a usual procedure for dealing with tax resistance is an illegal order, whether it was created by the collection office itself or approved by the bureau. The responsible officials should be subject to penalties for violations, and the long-standing illegal usual procedure should be revoked and abolished by the supervisory authority, with a strict order not to be used in the future. It is appropriate to submit this document to your government for review and approval for implementation, as it is in the public interest."</p>

<h3 id="e100">Yu Qiaqing and Others Submit a Request to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to Transfer the Administration of Shengsi Islands to Zhejiang; Approved by the Military Commission Last Winter <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Nantong Fishery Association and Others Publish Opposition in Newspapers</p>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reports that the issue of transferring the administration of Shengsi Islands, which belong to Chongming County, to Zhejiang was approved by the Military Commission in November of last year after being submitted by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, but has not yet been formally implemented. Unexpectedly, recently, the Township and Baojia Chiefs of the islands, as well as the Fishery Associations and Aquatic Products Associations of Nantong and other twelve counties, published their opposition in newspapers. Yu Qiaqing and other chairmen of the Ningbo, Dinghai, and Fenghua Fellow-Provincials Associations in this city have specially drafted a memorandum and submitted it to Huang Shaoxiong, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting him to uphold justice and promptly transfer the administration. The memorandum outlining the actual situation of why Shengsi Islands should be under the jurisdiction of Zhejiang is as follows: "We respectfully submit this memorandum to your review, as in December of last year, your government received a letter from the Third Department of the Office of the Military Commission, stating that the Chairman had forwarded a report from Zhao Juesheng, Administrative Inspector of the Ningbo Administrative Inspectorate District in Zhejiang Province, requesting that the Shengsi Islands, which belong to Chongming County, be placed under the administration of Zhejiang. This was approved and ordered to be implemented, and a copy of the original report was sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for their reference and implementation. The fishermen on the islands were overjoyed upon hearing the news. Recently, we read in the newspapers that more than 200 Township and Baojia Chiefs from various islands in Shengsi, as well as 31 Fishery Associations and Aquatic Products Academic Organizations from Nantong and other places, published their opposition, especially Lu Yanghao, who claimed to be from Jiangsu, and his memorial to the Civil Affairs Department, which was most forceful. To correct this distortion of facts and confusion of public opinion, we dare to refute it item by item as follows. Lu Yanghao's memorial (hereinafter referred to as Lu's memorial)</p>
<p>Based on the Kangxi</p>
<p>The tablet erected on Xiaoyangshan in the 29th year, Lu's memorial claims that the most powerful evidence for not transferring the islands to Zhejiang is the Xiaoyangshan tablet. However, geographical evolution has never been fixed. For example, Shengsi's belonging to Jiangsu only began during the Qing Dynasty. If we trace it back to the Ming, Yuan, and Song Dynasties, the islands belonged to Zhenhai, as clearly recorded in the Zhejiang Tongzhi and various old county records. Comparing this to that, it can be seen that the tablet erected by the government during the Kangxi period cannot be regarded as immutable. With the establishment of the Republic and the renewal of all government affairs, changes in systems and calendars, as well as transfers of provinces, prefectures, and counties, have been countless. Why should this tablet be regarded as sacred and inviolable? Regarding Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Industrial Plan, 'Along the coasts of the eastern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces, six fishing ports should be built. Six, Xinyang Port in eastern Jiangsu. Seven, Lvsi Port north of the mouth of the Yangtze River. Eight, Changtu in the</p>
<p>Zhoushan Islands</p>
<p>center. Nine, Shipu north of Sanmen Port in eastern Zhejiang.' The Shengsi Islands are very close to Changtu Port and fall within the scope of the Changtu fishing port. In comparison, the islands are far from Lvsi Port and have no connection to it. Lu's memorial cites the regulations of the Ministry of Interior regarding the demarcation of provinces, cities, and counties. Firstly, regarding transportation, the islands are more than 120 nautical miles from Chongming and only 100 nautical miles from Dinghai. A portion of the islands is separated from Huanglong, which belongs to Dinghai, by only a waterway. If a ship travels between Dinghai and the islands, it can arrive in the evening if it departs in the morning, compared to the four days it takes to travel from Chongming to Shengsi via Shanghai and Ningbo. The convenience or inconvenience is obvious. Moreover, mail has always been routed through Ningbo, further demonstrating the convenience of being under Zhejiang's jurisdiction. Secondly, regarding household registration, private investigations show that the islands have a total of 3,700 households and 16,636 people,</p>
<p>all Zhejiang people,</p>
<p>especially from Ningbo, accounting for almost two-thirds, and from Taizhou, accounting for one-third. There is almost no one from Jiangsu. The customs, habits, and language of the entire island are all Zhejiang. There have never been marriages with people from Chongming. Normally, they do not set foot in Chongming County. The government only has nominal jurisdiction without any local connection. Thirdly, regarding administration, the islands are far from Chongming, and communication is cut off. The residents are subjected to harassment by cunning officials and local bullies, and their grievances cannot be heard. This has led to tragic incidents from time to time. Moreover, residents of the islands who are involved in judicial cases are unfamiliar with the place in Chongming. If they are detained for a case, they need to find a guarantor. However, there is no relative or friend to be found. This difficulty is unavoidable. Fourthly, regarding coastal defense, the islands are often used as a base by pirates. During the late Qing Dynasty, the navies of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces often patrolled here together. After the establishment of the Republic, the joint patrol system was abolished. Whenever there are fishing boats, all</p>
<p>maritime protection</p>
<p>is the responsibility of Zhejiang. Jiangsu has never been involved. Fifthly, regarding bandit suppression, recent incidents of robbery, kidnapping, and looting have occurred frequently, especially Jianhu and Nanbeidingxin on Sijiao Island, which are known to be strongholds of bandits. These places are far from Jiangsu, beyond their reach. The Jiangsu authorities have few patrol ships for suppression and no water police for defense, allowing them to act recklessly and trample on the innocent. The islanders suffer from this scourge and have no way to complain. If the islands can be placed under the jurisdiction of Zhejiang, which can take responsibility for suppressing bandits nearby, the bandit problem can be solved with half the effort. Lu's memorial claims that the association is falsely claiming to represent public opinion. The so-called public opinion has no accurate standard. The islanders live by fishing and most are illiterate. It is impossible to obtain a truly legal expression of public opinion. A check of the real names of the more than 200 Township and Baojia Chiefs will likely reveal that they are fictitious. Moreover, according to reports from the islanders, the Chongming Defense Corps has threatened the Township and Baojia Chiefs, forcing them to sign</p>
<p>sworn opposition</p>
<p>declarations. It is the other side that is falsely claiming to represent public opinion. Lu's memorial uses the island and the dividing line of the river flow as the standard for the border. The island's shape has been drawn and explained in detail in the "Investigation Report" sent by Yue Chang and others, so there is no need to elaborate. As for the so-called Yangtze River and Qiantang River flowing into the sea and merging, the Shengsi Islands are located south and north of the confluence. Those who are slightly familiar with the geography of the outer sea can say this. Based on the above, it is very clear that transferring the islands to Zhejiang is beneficial to Zhejiang and does not harm Jiangsu. In short, the key is that the relationship between the governing and the governed should be based on the trend of facts and the needs of the environment. As for Yao Yongping, director of the Jiangsu Provincial Fishery Farm, who claims in his telegram that transferring the islands to Zhejiang will destroy the Jiangsu fishing industry, this is irrelevant. It should be known that fishermen in the Republic of China have no boundaries. Whether the islands belong to Jiangsu or Zhejiang has no impact on fishing in the two provinces. Moreover,</p>
<p>Jiangsu fishermen</p>
<p>use sand boats, while Zhejiang fishermen use hook boats. Their fishing locations are completely different. The director of the farm is not familiar with the actual situation of the fishing industry, so it is no wonder that he is making up things out of thin air. Furthermore, we have read in the newspapers that local gentlemen such as Han Guojun and Tang Wenzhi have also strongly telegrammed their opposition to the transfer of Shengsi. These gentlemen are local, impartial, and deeply secluded, and have never ventured into the sea. Their names may have been used by others in the telegram, which is unavoidable. We believe that the obstruction in this case must be caused by a few people who are manipulating and disrupting it, prioritizing their personal interests and using local boundaries as a cover. We dare to list the facts and submit them to your review, hoping that you will uphold justice, promptly transfer the administration to alleviate the suffering of the people and resolve the outstanding issue, as it is in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to Huang, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, by Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, Liu Hongsheng, Chairman of the Dinghai Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, and Yu Hualong, Chairman of the Fenghua Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai."</p>
<h3 id="e101">The Ratepayers' Association Sends a Letter to the Municipal Council Requesting the Abolition of the Rickshaw Committee <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association yesterday sent a letter to the Municipal Council stating: "Dear Sirs, We have received a joint letter from ratepayers Wang Jian'e, Ge Futian, Xu Jutang, Cao Zhigong, Liu Zhongying, Chen Jiufeng, Chen Binghui, and others stating that they recently read in the newspaper the abridged version of the Public Concession Municipal Council's budget for this year. Due to the decline of the market, tax revenue has sharply decreased. Therefore, the construction, security, and engineering projects that concern the public in the Concession, as well as the police and fire departments, have been drastically curtailed and personnel have been laid off. For example, the Engineering Department's budget is reduced by 484,100 yuan compared to last year's budget, and up to 18 foreign and Chinese staff members will be laid off by July of this year, saving 67,000 yuan in salaries. The Fire Department has also implemented a reduction in personnel. The five vacancies for station chiefs and deputy station chiefs will not be filled. The previously approved hiring of a secretary has now been suspended. The originally planned hiring of 19 Chinese firefighters, 3 craftsmen, and 1 driver has also been cancelled. Therefore, this year's budget is nearly 30,000 yuan lower than last year. The original budget of 263,420 yuan for storing items has been sharply reduced to 62,130 yuan. The Police Department's budget for this year is 302,970 yuan lower than last year. The source of this reduction is the temporary reduction of police personnel and the retrenchment implemented by the Police Commissioner. For example, the assistant superintendent will not be replaced after his recent retirement, and the number of inspectors, probationary inspectors, Indian constables, and Chinese constables will be reduced by 1, 30, 63, and 58, respectively. In the prison, the number of personnel has been reduced by more than 30 people. The budget for the Volunteer Corps this year is more than 80,000 yuan lower than last year, about one-fifth of the total. This saving comes from clothing repairs, military equipment, and travel expenses. The situation in other departments is also the same. It is clear that the Municipal Council's handling is appropriate and the Financial Secretary is well-versed in finance. However, the Council's temporary Rickshaw Committee, which is a redundant branch of the Police Department's Traffic Division, still requires an annual expenditure of more than 50,000 yuan, with the salaries of the three committee members alone requiring an expenditure of 46,800 yuan. In the midst of the retrenchment in various departments, there is no proposal to abolish or reduce its expenses. This is very surprising, given the Council's previous proposals. The Rickshaw Committee was originally established two years ago to implement the recommendations of the previous Rickshaw Investigation Committee. Since its establishment, what have been its achievements? Ratepayers who are not rickshaw merchants cannot make a judgment. However, the Committee's measures have caused several unprecedented rickshaw crises, which have greatly affected the security of the Concession, such as the conflict between rickshaw pullers and mutual aid societies on August 8, 1934. As a result, the Police Department has not only not reduced the duties of its Traffic Division, but also increased its security responsibilities to prevent the disruption of security due to the crises. Therefore, the Rickshaw Committee's achievements have already affected the security of the Concession, which is a fact that is evident. As ratepayers in the Public Concession, we should all admire the Municipal Council's retrenchment to avoid increasing the burden on ratepayers. However, it is very regrettable that the temporary Rickshaw Committee, which was established for a trial period of only eight months, has not been abolished after a year and that its budget has not been reduced. It is clear that its retrenchment standards do not distinguish between urgent and non-urgent matters. If the Rickshaw Committee is needed for consultation in addition to the Police Department's enforcement and management due to the complexity of the rickshaw issue, the Municipal Council already has a Rickshaw Special Committee. It is only necessary to enrich the organization of the Special Committee, or to follow the example of the Singapore Rickshaw Committee, where the committee members are honorary and do not require any expenses. If the Rickshaw Committee is not abolished because it was established for certain individuals and must exist permanently, then there are many other businesses in the Concession that require licenses, such as taxi companies, bus companies, tram companies, hotels, theaters, restaurants, teahouses, bathhouses, dance halls, and brothels. These could all have redundant branches established for them. The impact of this would not only waste the ratepayers' blood and sweat but also destroy the Council's good administrative system. Therefore, the Municipal Council should abolish the redundant Rickshaw Committee during the retrenchment, which would not only save more than 50,000 yuan per year but also reduce crises in the Concession to improve security. We respectfully request that the Council inform the Municipal Council and the Chinese Directors to follow the will of the ratepayers and abolish the Rickshaw Committee in a timely manner during this period of retrenchment to demonstrate proper savings and balance the budgets of various departments to maintain the security and order of the Concession."</p>

<p>The Iranian Consulate (formerly Persia) in Shanghai was established in May 1934. The Iranian government has now upgraded the Consulate to a Consulate General and appointed the former Consul, Mr. Ostoman, as the first Consul General in Shanghai. He will also be responsible for consular affairs in Xinjiang and the three northeastern provinces. Mr. Ostoman has served in the diplomatic field for more than 20 years and holds the title of Minister. He has good relations with Chinese and foreign parties in Shanghai. Tomorrow is the birthday of the Iranian monarch, Mr. Erwei. Mr. Ostoman will hold a tea party at the Consulate General at 591 Jing'an Temple Road from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM tomorrow to invite Chinese officials and foreign diplomats. Mayor Wu and others will attend to offer their congratulations.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Two US Government Offices to Relocate <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Dalu News reports that according to the US Consulate General in Shanghai, the Consulate General and the US Court for China will relocate from the old Kerry Hotel building at the corner of Jiujiang Road and Jiangxi Road to a new building at the corner of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road on or around March 26. They have leased the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh floors of the building. The US Court for China will move in a day or two before the Consulate General, as the Court has 8,000 books and archives, and the Consulate General has about the same number. If they move at the same time, it will be easy to confuse them and difficult to sort them out. The final preparations for the relocation will be made once the bookshelves in the new building are completed.</p>

<p>The Bankers' Association sent a circular letter to all member banks, which stated, "Regarding the letter received from Gu Songling, the reorganizer of the Bengbu Chamber of Commerce, and Sun Wu'fu and other representatives of various industry associations, (omission) etc., this has been approved. After discussion at today's (7th) executive committee meeting, concerning the proposal that Shanghai banks jointly provide loans to various businesses based on specified quotas, with real estate and securities as collateral, it was decided that while setting specific quotas would be difficult, providing loans with collateral is a normal banking practice that can help regulate the market. Therefore, it was resolved to circulate a letter to the banks in the association, hoping that those with branches in Bengbu will consider providing mortgage loans to help with financial turnover. This letter is sent accordingly, and we hope you will investigate and act accordingly." Yang Hu took the overnight express train to Beijing last night.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied yesterday to the Yantai Jufeng Bank's Zhongzhuang, instructing that scrip should be stamped according to law. "On the 13th of this month, we received your letter inquiring whether scrip can be considered a type of check and thus be exempt from stamping. We stated that this matter required detailed study before a reply could be given. Now, after examining Article 16, Section 4 of the revised Stamp Tax Law, in the remarks column, checks and scrip are listed separately and are not considered the same type. Furthermore, the tax exemption column only states that checks are temporarily exempt from stamping, so the scope of exemption cannot be extended to scrip by analogy.

<p>Since its establishment a few days ago, the Shanghai Relief Goods Association has been actively soliciting relief goods, as reported previously. The association's recent news is reported below:</p>
<p>Second Standing Committee Meeting</p>
<p>After the association's first Standing Committee meeting resolved matters such as the articles of association and the explanation of the Fortune Fruit Tickets, the various affairs are now actively underway. The association has scheduled its second Standing Committee meeting for 6:00 PM today at the Benevolence and Righteousness Charity Hall on Xinqiao Street, where the association's office is located.</p>
<p>Brief Overview Issued</p>
<p>The association plans to print 10 million Fortune Fruit Tickets. Although prizes have already been donated, including a garden house donated by Mrs. Yao of Suzhou, 560 mu of fertile land in Lianyungang donated by Mr. Tang Mufen, and various valuable jewelry, antiques, calligraphy, and paintings, in order to ensure that every ticket has a prize, the available prizes are still insufficient. It is necessary to actively solicit donations from generous benefactors in all sectors to achieve complete success. Therefore, a detailed guide to the various methods has been printed into a beautiful booklet called "A Brief Overview of Fortune Fruit Tickets," which will be printed and mailed upon request.</p>
<p>Continued Receipt of Relief Goods</p>
<p>In recent days, many donations of relief goods have been sent to the association by various sectors. Yesterday, Mr. Fang Jiaobo, a prominent figure in Shanghai, donated ten pairs of personally written楹聯 (yinglian, couplets), the Cun Gu Art Academy donated five pieces of calligraphy and painting, and calligrapher Mr. You donated four pairs of couplets.</p>

<p>In order to expand the fundraising movement for construction and disaster relief, the China International Famine Relief Commission gathered enthusiastic public figures from the Shanghai financial, educational, and commercial sectors in June 1934 to organize the Shanghai Volunteer Committee. Since its establishment, the committee members have been enthusiastic and resolute in their efforts to promote and raise funds, with remarkable results. Recently, more prominent figures in society have been invited to join and assist, further strengthening the committee's power. The annual meeting of the committee was held on the 4th of this month. Because the chairman, Mr. Chen Zheqing, was on duty abroad and unable to attend, the vice-chairman, Mr. Zhi Ke, convened the new and old committee members at 5:15 PM at the commission's Shanghai office at 505 Henan Road. Attendees included Dr. Chen Heqin, Dr. Roman, Baroness Sternberg, Ms. Xie Zuyi, as well as Mr. Baker, Liu Yuwan, Wang Xifan, Luo Chuanhua, and over twenty other people. The meeting began with a speech by Chairman Baker, welcoming the new committee members. Next, Mr. Luo Chuanhua, director of the Shanghai office, reported on the fundraising achievements of the past year and the fundraising plan for the spring relief effort this year, in great detail. All committee members expressed their efforts to assist. Finally, the officers were re-elected, with Mr. Guo Chengen appointed as chairman, Mr. Liu Yuwan and Dr. Roman as vice-chairmen, and Mr. Xu Xinliu and Mr. Gaisili as honorary treasurers. The discussion lasted for two hours, and the meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Route to Attend the Wang Guangqi Memorial Meeting <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Guangqi unfortunately passed away in Germany in January of this year. His friends have scheduled a memorial meeting for him at 10:30 AM on the 15th of this month (Sunday) at the National Conservatory of Music in the city center at Shijing Road. The route to the school is as follows: take Hua Shang Public Bus Company's Route 4 or 5 from the Baoshan Road intersection at the North Railway Station (about 20 minutes) to the Municipal Government. After getting off at the Municipal Government, walk north on Minqing Road for about ten minutes. It is said that the association has erected signposts along the way from the disembarkation point to aid in recognition.</p>
<h3 id="e112">The Beggar Relief Association Resolved to Request the Municipal Government to Relieve Beggars <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Beggar Relief Association, organized by the Chinese Women's Temperance Association, has been actively and tirelessly engaged in beggar relief work since its establishment. Currently, there are more beggars in Shanghai than usual, obstructing traffic, extorting money, and causing suffering to the people. This is also an intolerable insult to international observers. The association held an executive committee meeting at the Bank Club to discuss a proper solution. Chairman Wang Xiaolai, recorder Zhang Shilin, and Ms. Liu Wang Liming reported on recent contacts with the Municipal Council. If the Municipal Government and the French Concession simultaneously carry out beggar relief, the Council will join in, and funding will not be a problem. The core of the problem depends entirely on the Municipal Government's efforts and the willingness to liaise with the two concessions. In addition to Ms. Liu Wang Liming forwarding the Municipal Council's letter to Mayor Wu, the association also appointed Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yiting, Yan Fuqing, Liu Wang Liming, and Mao Wang Ruizhu to petition the Municipal Government this Wednesday.</p>
<h3 id="e113">The Road Association Scheduled to Host Team Leaders <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>

<p>Await the Arrest of Fugitives for Further Verification</p>
<p>Zhang Jinhai, a native of Yangzhou, was a barber at the teahouse opened by Qian Yinsheng in the Niqiangquan area of ​​Pudong. Because the teahouse was located in a remote area, far from the police station, it openly gambled all day long, taking cuts and profiting handsomely. Yang Yusheng (nicknamed "Iron Shop Yusheng"), a gangster, heard about this and went to demand a share. However, the teahouse owner, Qian Yinsheng, refused to yield. Yang was enraged and, feeling he had lost face, gathered Song Quansheng and others on the afternoon of the 16th of last month, each wielding pistols and axes, and stormed the teahouse. Zhang Jinhai was shot in the abdomen and immediately sent to a Shanghai hospital, where he died despite treatment. The body was inspected and identified by Zhang Peiming, a judge from the criminal division of the local court. At the same time, the local police station arrested Song Quansheng and escorted him to the local court for interrogation and prosecution, as reported previously. It is now learned that the deceased's wife, Zhang Liu, stated that her husband's death was caused by the teahouse owner Qian Yinsheng pushing him out the door, leading to him being shot and killed by the gangsters. She filed a lawsuit accusing Qian Yinsheng of causing death by negligence and demanding that he bear corresponding responsibility and be listed as a defendant. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Zhang Peiming presided over the trial in the Twelfth Tribunal. The plaintiff, Zhang Liu, arrived in court with her lawyer, Sun Bawo. The judge ordered the detainee Song Quansheng to be brought to the stand. According to his confession, he was 30 years old, a local, in the sesame oil business, residing in Lujia Ferry, Pudong. The judge asked, "Zhang Jinhai is now dead, are you aware of this?" He replied, "I am not aware." The judge asked, "Qian Yinsheng said that you were wielding an axe that day and injured his left foot, is that true?" He replied, "That is not true. I was collecting debts and passed by the Niqiangquan teahouse. Zhou Heshang, whom I knew, was drinking tea and invited me inside. A fight broke out outside shortly after, and then I heard gunshots. I was terrified and fled home, and I was arrested shortly after. I am truly innocent." The judge asked, "Where does the Zhou Heshang you mentioned live? He lives in Lujia Ferry and runs a small business. I can't find him right now." According to Qian Yinsheng's confession, he was 39 years old, a local, and insisted that Song Quansheng slapped him in the face first and then injured his left foot with an axe. Yang Yusheng fired the pistol, and they were carrying a total of three pistols. The judge asked, "Were there any tea guests named Zhou Heshang?" He replied, "No. Our teahouse is very rural, and only villagers drink tea." At this point, lawyer Sun stated that at the time of the incident, Qian Yinsheng instructed the deceased Zhang Jinhai to peek out the door, and the gangsters had not yet left. Then, Zhang was pushed out, and the gangsters shot him, piercing his abdomen, causing his death. Therefore, Qian Yinsheng is also guilty of negligence and should be listed as a defendant. The judge said, "Zhang Liu cannot file a private prosecution; the prosecutor should be responsible for the litigation." Finally, Zhang Liu stated that she was 30 years old, from Yangzhou, residing in Laobaidu, Pudong, and stated that her husband was pushed out by Qian Yinsheng, otherwise he would not have been injured and killed. She begged for investigation. The judge, based on the confessions, ordered that the other fugitives be arrested for further verification, and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>The court yesterday reviewed the case where the defendants were denied bail.</p>
<p>Further review pending examination of the records from the three trials.</p>
<p>Zhou Jinggeng, a comprador at Xue Mai Luo Accounting Firm at No. 9 Edward Road in the French Concession, was robbed of a large sum of money in his office on June 9th of the 23rd year [of the Republic], which implicated Zhang Zuming, a Ningbo native and shareholder of Ruichangshun Hardware Store at No. 101 Broadway Road. Zhang then implicated Zhuang Jimin, the owner of both large and small Zhuang Yuan, hardware salesman Wang Lianyou, and Tang Qingyue, the director of Dade Hospital. These individuals were successively arrested, brought before the Second Special District Court for trial, and ultimately found not guilty. The French Police Bureau disagreed and repeatedly appealed to the Higher Third Branch Court and the Supreme Court. The appeals were rejected each time, and the original verdict was upheld. Now, Zhang Zuming, believing that Zhou Jinggeng's false accusation caused him to be wrongfully detained, suffering losses in spirit and reputation, and feeling aggrieved, entrusted lawyer Lu Dingkui to file a criminal self-accusation with the Second Special District Court against Zhou Jinggeng, Gao Yushu, Feng Ti'e, Wan Guirong, Qian Genghua, Wang Guixiang, and others, accusing them of false accusation and perjury, and including a claim for 50,000 yuan in damages. This was reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the suspects were summoned. The plaintiff Zhang Zuming stated that he was engaged in the hardware business, and in June of the 23rd year [of the Republic], the defendants falsely accused him of being a thief, causing him to suffer damage to his spirit and reputation. When asked who first identified him as a robber, he replied that Gao Yushu first identified him as a robber and reported it to the police. He was arrested by the police at the entrance of Sanshou Lane on Broadway Road. While being taken to the Hongkou Police Station, the defendant Feng Ti'e also came to identify him as a thief. Later, when transferred to the French Police Station, You Guirong and Qian Genghua also identified him as a thief. During the second trial, the defendant Wang Guixiang also identified him as a robber. When asked if Zhou Jinggeng also identified him as a robber, he replied that Zhou Jinggeng also identified him as a thief at the police station. Gao Yushu stated that he worked at Xue Mai Luo Accounting Firm and that a few days after the large sum of money was robbed in June of the previous year, a civilian saw Zhang Zuming passing through the British Concession. He believed that Zhang was indeed the robber at the scene, so he reported it to the police, who dispatched detectives to assist in the arrest. Later, Feng Ti'e also went to the police station to identify him. The owner, Xue Mai Luo, also identified Zhang Zuming as the robber at the police station. Feng Ti'e claimed that he was at the office when the police called at seven o'clock and asked him to go to identify Zhang Zuming as the robber who committed the robbery at the scene. Wan Guirong stated that the detective from the police station called him to the police station, and among more than ten people, he identified Zhang Zuming as the robber. Wang Guixiang stated that the civilian indeed saw Zhang Zuming holding a gun and threatening the boss, Xue Mai Luo. Qian Genghua did not arrive. Zhou Jinggeng stated that he was previously a comprador at Xue Mai Luo Accounting Firm, but he has now resigned and is a comprador at Standard Milk Company. On the day of the robbery, he happened to be out on business and never identified the plaintiff Zhang Zuming as the robber. However, he received a letter from the plaintiff's lawyer on the 20th day of the first month of this year, demanding 32,000 yuan in damages, with a deadline for reply. He presented the letter for inspection and requested that the other four defendants be invited to the court. Lawyer Zhang Shanle defended on his behalf. At this point in the interrogation, Judge Li Changnian instructed that the records from the three trials must be reviewed before setting another date for the hearing. After the instruction, the plaintiff's lawyer, Lu Dingkui, requested the court to grant bail to the defendants, but the judge refused.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Gu Zhuxuan's Smoking Case: Joint Interrogation Yesterday <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, who was detained in the outer hospital ward (Guangci Hospital) of the Second Special Court for the case of instigating the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, was discovered to have been involved in two cases: bribing to retract testimony and harboring the smoking of opium. The case of bribing to retract testimony has already been prosecuted by the prosecutor and has been tried once, but the hearing has been postponed. The case of harboring the smoking of opium has also been publicly prosecuted by the prosecutor to the same court. Yesterday morning at 3:00 AM, Presiding Judge Wang Gangxu, along with Prosecutor Wang Ren, arrived at the Second Criminal Court. First, the defendants Jia Furong (42 years old, from Suqian, director of learning guards in the Second Special District Prison, stationed at Guangci Hospital to guard Gu Zhuxuan) and Wu Lu (41 years old, from Yangzhou, director of guards at the Second Special District Detention Center, stationed at Guangci Hospital to guard Gu Zhuxuan) were summoned. Then, Prosecutor Wang rose to make an accusation, stating that the two defendants, Jia Furong and Wu Lu, while performing their duties when stationed at Guangci Hospital, harbored the murderer Gu Zhuxuan, allowing him to smoke opium in the hospital ward. On December 24th of last year, the head of the Second Section, Ouyang Sen, confiscated opium and smoking paraphernalia, as well as white powder cigarettes, etc., from Gu Zhuxuan's prison cell. The two defendants, Jia and Wu, have committed crimes under Article 134 of the Criminal Law and Article 13, Paragraph 3 of the Provisional Regulations on the Prohibition of Opium. The details are stated in the indictment, requesting that they be interrogated according to the law. Jia Furong testified that he has been employed since July of the 22nd year [of the Republic], for two and a half years. When asked if the official had previously heard that the prisoner Li Heshang had reported that he was harboring Gu Zhuxuan's smoking of opium, Jia replied that the two prisoners, Li Heshang and Guo Shanyu, were transferred to the hospital ward one after another last winter. One day, Li Heshang borrowed money from Gu Zhuxuan but failed, and the two quarreled. He learned of this and went inside to mediate. On December 24th, the prisoner Wang A'er dug a hole to escape. He learned of this and reported it to the head of the Second Section. When Wang was taken away for interrogation, Wang confessed that he was stealing opium paste. He then went with the section chief to search and found these dangerous drugs. The opium pipe was found in the toilet. When asked about his duties in the hospital ward, he replied that he was only in charge of preventing prisoners from escaping and fighting. When asked if he went into the hospital room, he replied that he performed his duties at the door. When asked if he inspected the items sent by Gu's family, he replied that there were three parties inspecting: the police, the detention center, and the hospital ward guards. The police station also sent three plainclothes detectives and two patrol officers to monitor. If they discovered opium smoking, they would definitely report it. Wu Lu was then summoned and testified that the hospital ward was managed by the prison. Due to the great responsibility after Gu Zhuxuan was detained last year, the prison requested the detention center to send him to guard. When asked if he inspected the items sent by Gu's family, he replied that only the hospital staff inspected them first, and then he and others inspected them again. The prisoner Li Heshang testified that he was convicted of life imprisonment for robbery and murder and was transferred to the outer hospital ward on January 27th of last year due to illness. One night, late at night, Gu Zhuxuan was making noise, and he intervened, asking him to be quieter, but Gu scolded him. At that time, Gu was smoking opium in the room, and prisoner No. 963 was preparing the opium for him. He reported this to Director Jia, but Jia said that he was not smoking. When asked if Gu Zhuxuan smoked in the morning or at night, he replied that he smoked both morning and night. When asked if he smoked in the small room, he replied yes. When asked if Director Jia said that he was trying to extort Gu, he replied no. At this point, the judge asked Jia Furong, "Li Heshang just said that Gu Zhuxuan was smoking opium and that you were informed of it." Jia replied, "That is not true. He (referring to Li) tried to extort Gu but failed, so I transferred him to the prison. He is therefore holding a grudge." Guo Shanyu, 26 years old, was summoned. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and entered the hospital ward in January of last year due to illness. One night, late at night, Gu Zhuxuan was making a lot of noise. He could not sleep, so he asked him to be quieter, but he refused and argued with him, and reported to Director Jia that they were causing trouble for him. Director Jia said that he would transfer them to the prison tomorrow. When asked if he had said that Director Jia accepted bribes to harbor the act, he replied yes, Gu Zhuxuan smoked opium, and No. 963 prepared the opium for him. Wang A'er was then summoned and testified that he was sentenced for four years and eight months for theft and went to the outer hospital ward in November of last year. One day, due to illness and thirst, he stole a pear from Boss Gu, and Gu saw him and scolded him, saying that he would beat him to death. Therefore, he decided to steal two opium pastes from him. When asked who Gu Zhuxuan asked to buy opium, he replied that Gu Zhuxuan asked Director Wu to buy five yuan of opium every seven days, and Wu stuffed the opium through a hole in the wall. When asked if Director Jia knew that Director Wu bought opium, he replied that Jia saw it but did not care. When asked if the section chief said that he was transferred back to prison because he dug a hole to escape, he replied that it was because he stole opium paste, not to escape. The judge asked Wu Lu, "Wang A'er said that you bought opium for him, is this true?" He replied, "I dare not buy it." Liu Mingjing, from Sichuan, was then interrogated. He was sentenced to five years for theft and entered the hospital ward on November 30th of last year. When asked if he had seen anyone smoking opium, he replied no, but he smelled opium smoke. One day, Gu's maid brought food and told Gu that there was opium in it. Then, Director Jia took the food inside. According to Jia, Liu Mingjing hated him because he scolded him for smoking cigarettes. Chen Guofang, nicknamed "Baidu Bridge," was then interrogated. He was sentenced to nine months for robbery. When asked if he knew about the opium smoking in the small room, he replied that there was no opium smoking. At this point, Li Heshang questioned Chen, saying that Baidu Bridge had personally told him about how Boss Gu smoked opium, how prisoner No. 963 prepared the opium for him, and how Director Jia secretly fitted the key to the small room, but now he denied it. Judge Wang instructed that the case would be adjourned for further interrogation.</p>

<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, in view of the proliferation of private toilets in the city, which are detrimental to public health, has received letters from citizens in the district requesting a crackdown. According to Yun Jihua, director of the Shanghai South Health Office of the Health Bureau, the Municipal Health Bureau is currently conducting registration of private toilets. Those that do not meet the requirements of the Health Bureau, or are located on streets where toilets should not be established, will be eliminated. If the Health Bureau believes that there is a need to establish a toilet in a certain location, but there is no public toilet, then temporary permission will be granted for the establishment, to be used as a public toilet, recognizing its property rights. However, private toilets that have been temporarily approved by the Health Bureau must upgrade their facilities, such as installing tap water and electric lights, and connecting to sewers, to improve sanitation. The fee for toilet paper should not be too high, and taxes must be paid to the Finance Bureau. It is learned that there were originally over a hundred private toilets in the city, and as a result of repeated crackdowns by the bureau, the number has gradually decreased, but there are still fifty to sixty today.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo line includes China Merchants Bureau's Xin Jiangtian, Ningshao Company's Xin Ningshao, Sanbei Company's Ningxing, Taikoo Company's Xin Beijing, and Daxing Company's Xin Hongxing, five ships. Last year, in order to rectify the tea house's demand for liquor fees and to treat passengers favorably, China Merchants took the lead in implementing the practice. Daxing also planned to temporarily cancel the collection of 20% liquor fee to show uniformity. However, since the trial operation, there have still been instances of passengers and tea houses exchanging liquor fees, and the measures are not thorough enough, which does not align with the original intention of the companies to treat passengers favorably. It is learned that the four companies held a meeting and decided that starting from the 16th of this month (Monday), they would publish a notice stating that all cabin classes would uniformly collect a 20% liquor fee and issue a small ticket, requesting passengers not to give liquor fees again to prevent abuses. Daxing will also publish a notice at the same time to restore the 20% liquor fee collection method. Xin Beijing is still working on the issue of reducing tea houses, and although it has not been listed in the notice at the same time, it will also uniformly charge an additional 10% on passenger tickets starting from the same day to show uniformity.</p>

<p>Police Station Mediation Fails, Case Transferred to Headquarters</p>
<p>Zhang Yuan, a Henan woman, 29 years old, living at No. 15 Manli Lane in the city, has a four-year-old son with her husband, whom she cherishes dearly. However, Gao Zhiqing, a 38-year-old Ningbo native and friend of her husband, often visits her home. Recently, taking advantage of her husband's absence, he approached her and claimed that her son was fathered by him and that he wanted to take him back to raise in order to maintain his bloodline. Zhang Yuan adamantly denied this, leading to arguments and fighting. Police Officer Wang Zihe from the station brought them to the Yemiao Police Station for investigation. According to Gao Zhiqing's statement, he had been having an affair with Zhang Yuan for two years and had now broken up. However, he wanted to take back the son they had together, but Zhang Yuan refused. According to Zhang Yuan's statement, Gao Zhiqing is a friend of her husband and often visits her home. Today, he falsely accused her of having an affair with him and wanted to take her child away. However, her child is four years old, and he claimed the affair was two years ago, so how could the child be his? The case was deemed a family dispute over a child and was not accepted. Although mediation was attempted, neither party would concede, so they were both transferred to headquarters for further investigation.</p>

After repeated interrogations, the trial was concluded. However, one of them, Zhao Cheng, was found to be unrelated and was released. Liu Zuochen, who was only twelve years old, was also unrelated to the cases, so he was sent to the Women and Children's Relief Association for care. Liu Huaizhen was granted bail, and the rest were held for sentencing. These details have been reported in this newspaper many times. This morning, the presiding judge, Liu Yugui, announced the verdict in the Eighth Criminal Court.

Tang Wang is sentenced to four months of imprisonment for possessing firearms and ammunition without permission. The remaining Yang Jin and others are found not guilty. The two handguns and eighteen bullets are confiscated. After the announcement, Wang Rusong, a detective from the French Police Bureau, submitted a document from the Second Special Court, stating that Yang Jin, Qian Liu, Qian Jinshan, and Miao Diankui had committed another case in the French Concession and requesting permission to transfer them. Gao Wansheng, the squad leader of the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, also submitted a document, stating that the defendants had also committed major crimes of robbery and murder in Yancheng and other places in Jiangbei. Therefore, except for Tang Wang, it was requested that the remaining defendants be permitted to be transferred for trial.

<h3 id="e147">Municipal Council Band to Hold Sunday Concert Tomorrow <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Tomorrow (Sunday) is the date of the Municipal Council Band's regularly scheduled Sunday concert, the 23rd Sunday concert. The program is popular in nature, and this year marks the 50th anniversary of the death of the great Hungarian writer Franz Liszt. Therefore, the program will consist entirely of Liszt's masterpieces. Liszt was a piano virtuoso, unmatched in ancient and modern times. He was also a famous composer, so those who study Western music history often say that without Liszt and Berlioz (a French writer), Wagner could not have emerged. The creation of orchestral music began with Liszt and Berlioz, and Wagner synthesized their best works to create a spectacular scene. The most widely known of Liszt's compositions are the "Symphonic Poems," a total of thirteen chapters, of which "Tasso" and "Les Préludes" are the most moving. In addition, there are "Hungarian Rhapsodies," etc., all of which will be performed one by one tomorrow. The concert starts at 5:15, and tickets are only one yuan or half a yuan. Music lovers should not miss this opportunity.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Shanghai's Securities Industry (4) <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Compiled by China Credit Bureau (Seventeenth Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce)</p>
<p>Handling Fees and Trading Methods: The commission charged by the exchange to brokers is called a handling fee. The standard for collection is calculated based on the actual transaction amount, with 6.25 yuan deducted per 10,000 yuan. Brokers charge their clients double this amount. However, due to varying circumstances among different firms, uniformity is difficult to achieve. Generally, one-thousandth is the common standard, but it has recently dropped to seven or eight ten-thousandths. For bank transactions, some brokers only pay a net spread of 6.25, as the brokers have other considerations.</p>
<p>The actual handling fees collected by the exchange from brokers are required to be partially refunded to the brokers as bonuses at the end of each year, according to the provisions of the business regulations. The method of returning this money depends on the amount of handling fees paid by each broker during the year. Brokers numbered 1 to 55 can receive 2.35 percent, while those numbered 52 to 80 receive only 1.5 percent. This difference is due to the fact that when the goods and securities sections were merged, the 55 brokers who were originally part of the exchange made a request for separate treatment. Therefore, the value of a broker's position varies accordingly. Based on current market value, the former is worth approximately 30,000 yuan, while the latter is worth 25,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The trading method used in the industry is continuous buying and selling. First, brokers solicit transactions from banks, money houses, government agencies, and private clients. Among these, the financial sector accounts for the largest volume, representing one-half of the total. Merchants from the north, merchants from Guangdong, government figures, and capitalists make decisions. During the trading hours specified by the exchange, prices are called out sequentially, and buying and selling are conducted by brokers. Once a counterparty is found, the transaction is declared "completed." After the transaction is completed, the exchange enters it into the floor account, and then both the buying and selling brokers sign the agreement. The exchange also sets an appropriate closing price at the end of each trading day, requiring brokers to settle their accounts accordingly. The profit or loss is settled the next day. Both the buying and selling parties must also pay a special margin deposit of 400 yuan per 10,000 yuan face value. (The amount can be adjusted by the board of directors based on market conditions. Sellers who have physical goods and provide them do not have to pay.) Those who have sufficient funds in their accounts can settle on the delivery date. Otherwise, they must close the position or roll it over before the deadline to end the transaction. This is an overview of the trading method. Other strategies, such as arbitrage (buying near-term contracts and selling far-term contracts to profit from market differences), are not easy to execute without sufficient capital and expertise.</p>
<p>Overview of Brokers: Most brokers at the exchange are financially sound and are organized by financial institutions. Their capital ranges from 30,000 yuan to 300,000 yuan. Successful brokers often have handling fee revenues exceeding 100,000 yuan. A list of the brokers' license numbers and names is provided below: 1. Tong Yi, Li Ziwei; 21. Zhong Yi, Wang Jiaosheng; 3.

<p>Yesterday's Practice Match at the China Tennis Club</p>
<p>Showed Superb Skill, Winning Three to One</p>
<p>Xu Chengji, the Chinese tennis player who will be participating in this year's Davis Cup, arrived in Shanghai on the North German Lloyd steamship Scharnhorst at 5:20 PM the day before yesterday. That evening, he stayed at the private residence of Tan Jing, president of the China Tennis Club, in the Wah Yip Building on Seymour Road. Yesterday afternoon, Lin Baohua, Cai Huiquan, Qian Yaobin, Carson, and others visited him one after another, and they had a very pleasant conversation. At around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, Xu Chengji and Carson went to the China Tennis Club on Singapore Road to show off their skills. They played four sets. In the first set, Xu Chengji won 6-2. In the second set, Xu Chengji was ahead 4-3, but unfortunately lost 4-6 in the end. In the third and fourth sets, Xu Chengji won again, 6-3 and 6-2 respectively. In conclusion, Xu Chengji defeated Carson three to one. Xu Chengji had been away from us for almost half a year, ever since he left for Java after participating in the National Games last winter. In yesterday's match, he played calmly and unhurriedly, and his demeanor was still as good as ever. His ability to save dangerous balls, his long shots from the left and right, and his clever shots into the corners of the net all kept Carson running around in a frenzy. His powerful smashes also had excellent landing points. After several months of absence, Xu Chengji's tennis skills have improved again. Yesterday's scores for each set are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e157">Hong Kong Football: Hua Lian Wins the Lai Wah Cup; Defeats the Navy League Two to Zero; Feng Jingxiang and Li Huitang Each Score a Goal <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) The annual Lai Wah Cup football final was held on the 8th at the So Kon Po Stadium between the Hua Lian team and the Navy League team. The weather was mild that day, so football fans flocked to watch the match. Before 4:00 PM, the stadium was already full, and those who arrived later had no place to stand. It is estimated that there were more than 8,000 fans in total. After 90 minutes of hard fighting, Hua Lian defeated the Navy team two to zero, winning this year's championship. In today's match, Hua Lian replaced Huang Meishun with Lin Depu. The center back, Qian Zhujiang, although he did not show any amazing performance, was still able to unite with the backs to defend the city. Depu supervised the opposing center forward, making him unable to do anything. The two backs, Mai Shaohan, were lively and agile, and their coordination was appropriate. It is a pity that the two's heading skills were far inferior to the opponent's, which was a fly in the ointment. In the second half, the Navy League changed its formation, using a fierce kick to attack. The Hua Lian players were helpless, allowing the enemy to penetrate deep into their territory. If it were not for Ji Liang's efforts to defend the dangerous city, Hua Lian would not have been able to keep half of its territory. The performance of the five forwards was far better than the previous day, but their coordination was not yet truly effective. In the first half, they attacked more than they defended, with Feng Jingxiang and Li Huitang scoring two goals in succession. In the second half, the situation changed dramatically. The Navy League turned from defense to attack, and its imposing manner made the spectators breathless. Because the Navy League's forwards were not good at shooting, the Hua Lian defenders, although they were repeatedly surrounded, were still lucky enough to avoid losing. This was Hua Lian's luck, and the Navy League's bad luck. The Navy team used Hu Huachen as the center back. He was more than enough to defend, but still unable to coordinate with the forwards. Moreover, the center forward and the right forward repeatedly missed opportunities, so they were defeated. As for the bravery of the players, it was far beyond what Hua Lian could match.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Outline for the Implementation of Physical Education in Secondary Schools in Jiangsu Province <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has approved the "Outline for the Implementation of Physical Education in Secondary Schools in Jiangsu Province for the 24th Year," submitted by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, and has issued instructions for its filing. The original text of the outline is as follows:</p>
<p>(I) General Principles: All public and private secondary schools in the province must, starting from this year, implement strict physical training for all students in accordance with the provisions of this outline. The ultimate goals of implementing physical training in schools are as follows. Simultaneously or in stages, use practical methods to achieve tangible results: (A) To ensure that the physical fitness of every student is fully developed; (B) To ensure that every student's spirit is lively and resilient; (C) To ensure that every student's physical ability is sufficient to cope with all environments; (D) To ensure that every student's behavior is naturally in accordance with national etiquette and discipline; (E) To ensure that every student's life is full of vigor and vitality. Schools should complete the systematic organization of physical education administration throughout the school within this year to serve as the center for implementing physical training for all students. Schools should establish a physical education budget starting from this year, reducing unnecessary expenses and increasing necessary construction. Schools should formulate concrete plans to expand physical education facilities and equipment starting from this year, implementing them in stages to meet the needs of this outline. Schools should formulate detailed plans and implement them diligently for all physical education activities, including physical education courses, morning exercises, extracurricular activities, and intramural and extramural sports competitions, in accordance with the Ministry's Physical Education Curriculum Standards for Secondary Schools and the provisions of this outline. Schools should conduct rigorous assessments of students' physical training performance starting from this year, and those who fail will not be allowed to advance or graduate. Schools should earnestly conduct physical examinations of students starting from this year, at least once per semester, to serve as the basis for implementing physical training. The implementation of this outline shall be the joint responsibility of the principals, deans, directors of student affairs, business managers, junior high school principals, grade-level teachers, physical education teachers, scout trainers, military instructors, and school doctors of each school. All faculty members of the school have the obligation to assist. The performance of the implementation of this outline shall be subject to rewards and punishments by provincial and county inspectors and special personnel at any time. (II) Administration: Schools should organize a physical education committee to preside over all physical education administration throughout the school. The physical education committee shall be composed of the principal, dean, director of student affairs, business manager, junior high school principal, physical education teachers, scout trainers, military instructors, school doctors, and enthusiastic faculty members. The principal shall appoint one physical education teacher as a standing committee member. The physical education committee shall meet at least three times per semester, and its functions shall be as follows: (A) To determine the annual physical education implementation plan at the beginning of the school year; (B) To compile and review the spending plan and actual spending of physical education funds; (C) To plan the expansion or renovation of sports fields and equipment; (D) To review and approve various management methods for all physical education activities throughout the school; (E) To seek improvements in school hygiene and improvements in student life; (F) Other matters related to the improvement of overall physical education. The standing committee member of the physical education committee shall, under the order of the principal and the entrustment of the physical education committee, plan and implement all physical education matters throughout the school in accordance with the provisions of this outline, and shall compile the implementation situation into a work report and submit it to the physical education committee for review at each meeting. Schools should lead all students to organize various sports groups to achieve the effect of popularization and development. The physical education organizations organized by the students of each school, regardless of the activity, should be subject to the control and guidance of the physical education committee. (III) Funding: Schools should compile a separate spending plan and actual spending for the physical education fees paid by students, the physical education funds in the school budget, and other funds belonging to physical education. At the beginning and end of the school year, the principal shall submit a special report. The physical education funds of each school should be used exclusively for the needs of physical education consumption and equipment and should not be misappropriated arbitrarily. The distribution standard of physical education funds in each school is as follows: (A) Physical education consumption fees, such as the purchase of sports equipment and the repair of equipment, shall not exceed 50% of the total amount; (B) Event fees, such as the expenses of participating in various sports events, shall not exceed 20% of the total amount; (C) Physical education equipment fees, such as the construction of sports grounds and the purchase of fixed equipment, shall not be less than 30% of the total amount. (IV) Equipment: Schools should follow the minimum standards for physical education equipment promulgated by the department, formulate a phased expansion plan together with the budget, and submit them separately for approval. Schools should make full use of the open space in the school to arrange the physical education environment, thereby arousing students' interest and achieving results imperceptibly. Schools should try to make use of the natural environment outside the school to provide students with physical training. Within the possible range, the sports grounds and equipment of each school should be opened to the nearby public for amateur sports, but detailed management methods should be established. Schools should have adequate indoor sports facilities so that students can have adequate activities during rainy and snowy periods. (V) Physical Education Course: The physical education course hours in each secondary school must meet the standards promulgated by the Ministry and must not be reduced. In co-educational schools, girls should take physical education classes separately from boys. If there are too few girls, they may schedule another time and combine classes. As a general rule, physical education classes should not be scheduled within one hour before or after meals and after 4:00 PM each day. When attending physical education class, students should first form a team and wait for the teacher to arrive. The class leader should give the order to stand at attention and salute. The class leader should check the number of students present and absent and the names of the absentees after forming the team and report them clearly to the teacher. When attending physical education class, teachers should pay attention to discipline training to enhance the effectiveness of training and management. When attending physical education class, students should wear uniforms or sportswear. Those who violate this rule will be considered absent without reason. The physical education course should focus on teaching basic sports methods and should not allow students to engage in activities at will according to their preferences. The physical education course should be based on the principle that all students in the class have equal opportunities for activity. If necessary, students may be grouped according to their physical education performance in the previous semester to maintain students' interest in sports. Physical education teachers should prepare a syllabus and details of the physical education curriculum in advance and implement them accordingly. However, the teaching materials for apparatus gymnastics and mat exercises shall be based on the teaching materials promulgated by the department. In addition to adding supplementary teaching materials, all schools should comply. All new students enrolled from the 24th year should be taught as many apparatus gymnastics and mat exercises as listed in the detailed syllabus promulgated by the department. Old students from previous years may make appropriate changes according to their teaching level, but they must still meet the following quantitative standards: (A) In the second and third grades of junior high school, at least 15 kinds of apparatus and mat exercises must be taught each school year; (B) In the second and third grades of high school, at least 10 kinds of apparatus and mat exercises must be taught each school year; (C) Vocational schools may appropriately reduce the number depending on the number of hours. The allocation of types of physical education course materials shall be implemented in accordance with the standards promulgated by the Ministry, but the teaching time for flexibility exercises, apparatus exercises, or mat exercises in each class shall not be less than 20 minutes. The selection of physical education course materials should focus on developing muscle strength and promoting public and private virtues such as courage, decisiveness, cooperation, and sacrifice. Games and entertainment are secondary. Girls may consider using apparatus exercises in the middle school period, and it is especially appropriate to use mat exercises. Dance should focus on fitness and folk dance. Light apparatus exercises may be used in place of flexibility exercises. In the case of girls' physical education classes, each school should have strict regulations and detailed records to maintain physical health and avoid adverse results. However, those who try to avoid this rule must be given a serious warning. In case of heavy rain or wet ground, except for one lesson per month that can be changed to lecturing on physical education knowledge in the classroom, classes should be held as usual in the gym or other places, and should not be suspended on the pretext of weather. Those who do not have indoor sports grounds must change to lecturing on knowledge and sports rules or methods in the classroom. It is permissible to do some indoor exercises or static games. The lecture notes on physical education knowledge should be compiled and printed by the teachers for each student. (The following also includes morning exercises and forced running, etc., which are omitted for brevity.)</p>

<p>Women's Wu Team Defeats Soviet Erhua Two to One</p>
<p>There was one women's match and one Group A match in the Western Youth Volleyball Tournament last night. The Women's Wu Team defeated Soviet Erhua two to one. The Western Youth, on the other hand, won McLing in straight sets. Haiqing has been invincible in this year's Western Youth Volleyball Tournament, maintaining the prowess of its champion team from the previous year. In yesterday's match, McLing got the right to serve first, but immediately lost it. Haiqing's Ge Lai also failed to get the ball over the net on the serve. Soon, Haiqing got another chance to serve. Yang Bingxiang quickly scored as many as seven points in one go. McLing barely managed to score two points. In a flash, the situation changed drastically, and Haiqing won the first set fifteen to two. At the beginning of the second set, McLing put the new force Na Shuerdeng on the field. After the serve, Zheng Yishi's ball went out of bounds more and more bravely. Smashes, blocks, and lifts, McLing could not resist. As a result, Haiqing won again fifteen to one. In the third set, they circled a few times and gained nothing. Haiqing scored two points first, and then McLing scored one point. After that, there was still no progress. Haiqing was unstoppable. When it was thirteen to one, Haiqing had victory in hand, and the battle gradually became relaxed. Xu Bieshi added three points in a row. Zheng Yiquan made a determined effort and smashed fiercely, and then completed the feat with fifteen to four. In total, McLing only scored seven points in three sets.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Statement by the Pudong Small Ball Association Regarding the Hua Zhi Team Incident <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Having read in your esteemed newspaper the other day that the Hua Zhi team, a member of our association, was judged to have violated sportsmanship and received appropriate punishment, it is regrettable that they did not reflect on their actions but instead made careless statements. This not only confuses the public but also undermines the entire small ball (sports) endeavor. It is truly disheartening to speak of. While it is understandable that young people are full of energy and eager to win, for the sake of clarifying the facts, we must correct their statements.</p>
<p>The match in question took place at 9:50 AM on March 1st. The team's claim that it took place on "February 23rd, many weeks ago" is likely due to forgetfulness.</p>
<p>It is common knowledge that the Shi Xin team is not a fundamental team of our association. The only team with fundamental team status is the junior team. This team had a dispute with a friendly team in the youth group, which our association investigated. It was determined that the championship should be awarded to the other team. The team's claim of protecting a fundamental team is self-explanatory.</p>
<p>The match took place on March 1st. The next day, we received a protest letter from the Shi Xin team. After investigation, it was discovered that Wang Degen, who played for the Hua Zhi team on that day, was actually Yao Guanfan. When a meeting was convened, it was unanimously agreed that the use of a completely different name was an undeniable violation of sportsmanship. Therefore, the Hua Zhi team was penalized with a loss, and the player in question was lightly punished with disqualification. This was detailed in the notification sent to the team. However, the team now claims that "the name was not pointed out, clearly fabricating the matter," which shows extreme carelessness.</p>
<p>In conclusion, organizing small ball competitions not only entails enduring hardship and complaints in spirit but also inevitably results in significant material losses. There is absolutely no possibility of seeking personal gain through false pretenses. The Youth Association authorities are dedicated to public welfare and have made sacrifice their sole mission. We have been holding small ball competitions for four sessions. If, as the team claims, we were manipulating championships, who would believe we would do something so unprofitable?</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Pudong Small Ball Association</p>

<p>The Boy Scout movement in our country began in the first year of the Republic of China. At that time, as it was still in its early stages, the organization and training were not unified. It was not until March 15th of the 15th year of the Republic of China that the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang decided to place the Boy Scout movement under the leadership of the party and determined its organizational system and training principles. Only then did the Boy Scout movement in our country gradually become perfect. Based on the above historical facts, March 15th is indeed the day when the new life of the Boy Scout movement in our country was officially established, and a grand celebration should be held to commemorate it for a long time. Last year, the General Association of Chinese Boy Scouts convened a training conference, which also resolved that this day should be designated as Boy Scout Day in our country every year. It is now learned that the General Association of Boy Scouts has already formulated commemorative measures and issued them to the Boy Scout organizations in various provinces, cities, and counties, ordering each to hold a celebration ceremony at 8:00 AM tomorrow. The City Boy Scout Council has also decided to comply with the order and hold a celebration assembly at 8:00 AM tomorrow at the City First Sports Field on Daji Road in Nanshi. Each Boy Scout troop in the city has been ordered to send one or two squads of members to attend on time. The order of the celebration ceremony and the list of officers of the assembly are listed below:</p>

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Director Pan, Recorder Qian Fugong. The meeting began with a report by the Chairman, briefly stating that today is the third plenary meeting of the Middle School Normal Education Research Association this semester, to discuss the research reports of each group from the previous semester, and to decide on the central question and research steps for this semester. Due to the excessive number of questions and the early school break last semester, the research association was unable to conclude as scheduled. Currently, the results of all groups, except the Moral Education and Military Training Group, including the results of the Financial Resources and Equipment Group, the Graduation Examination Group, and the Curriculum and Teaching Group, have been submitted for discussion at today's meeting. For the research methods this semester, in addition to the groups that have not yet concluded from the previous semester continuing their research, the other groups intend to change the grouping methods separately. After grouping, the date and location of the small group meetings will be decided by the chairman of each group, and members of each group will be notified, and the Bureau of Education will be notified to send personnel to participate. In addition, regarding the revision of the middle school curriculum standards last year, the Ministry of Education sought opinions, and the association has compiled and submitted them. The revisions announced by the Ministry of Education are completely the same as the results discussed by the association, and have been adopted by the Ministry of Education. It is hoped that in the future, the spirit of the past will be maintained to put forward research on other issues.</p>
<p>Reports from Each Group</p>
<p>Chen Jicheng, Chairman of the Graduation Examination Group, reported that three small group meetings were held last semester, and the various issues were divided into two major categories: graduation examinations and grade assessment. The research results show that the intention of the examination system is very good, but there are many malpractices. Therefore, if it cannot be abolished, two remedial measures have been proposed. Results have also been achieved in the area of grade assessment. Zhang Yi, Chairman of the Financial Resources and Equipment Group, reported that three cases were unresolved last semester, and there were also the results of a separate study by Zhang Du of Maitou Middle School. The Curriculum and Teaching Group Chairman Liao Maoru reported that there were a total of twenty-nine questions last semester, which were discussed in three groups. As the report has not been compiled yet, the meeting minutes of each group will be submitted for discussion.</p>
<p>Discussion Issues</p>
<p>Graduation Examination Group: The first case, the proposal to abolish the graduation examination, was revised to temporarily suspend the middle school graduation examination during the period of preparation for national crisis education and submit the opinion to the Ministry of Education. The remaining cases were passed according to the original proposed results.</p>
<p>Financial Resources and Equipment Group: Except for the third and eighth cases, the remaining cases were passed with modifications according to the original proposed results.</p>
<p>Curriculum and Teaching Group: Except for the sixth case in the first subgroup, the remaining cases were passed with modifications according to the original proposed results.</p>
<p>Curriculum and Teaching Group: Except for the first and sixth cases in the second subgroup, which were reserved for further discussion, and the seventh case, which was canceled, the remaining cases were passed with modifications according to the original proposed results.</p>

<p>The Huzhou Middle and Primary School Alumni Association in Shanghai has been established for thirty years. Tens of thousands of students have graduated or attended over the years. However, as they gather and disperse, it is difficult to meet regularly, and their professional paths differ, leading to limited communication. Although there was an alumni association in the past, the organizers have scattered north and south, and it has long been virtually suspended. Therefore, former classmates Min Danwei, Zhang Houqin, Zheng Bingwen, Yu Renchang, Sun Jinhong, Lu Qianshe, Jiang Zhihuang, Pan Jiaxun, etc., invited the current principal Shen Yanxiang and former teachers Shen Jiesheng, Ji Xiazong, and former president Zhou Zongmo, etc., to jointly initiate the reorganization of the alumni association. Preparatory meetings have been held since February 10th. It has been decided that March will be the solicitation period. All classmates who have graduated or attended the school, and teachers who have taught at the school, can join the alumni association. The official establishment is scheduled for mid-April. It is heard that the preparatory committee is located in the alma mater in Zhengxiuli, Kaifeng Road, where alumni survey forms are available and will be sent upon request.</p>

So they looked like quaint and interesting figures painted on a fan.

<p>——Resulting in a Drop of 1.2 Yuan——</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the approach of the swap period, many major speculators sold off their positions, making it difficult for the gold market to rally at the opening. The March-April spread rose to 3 yuan, and sentiment was weak, leading to a mid-day decline. However, the market managed to close near flat. In the morning, the overseas silver market saw a squeeze over two days, with London rising and the U.S. remaining flat. The Mondelli forward silver price only increased by 1/10 of a cent in March, and the rest remained unchanged. Exchange rates continued to contract. London spot gold rose by a penny. The Central Bank's official exchange rates showed both the British pound and the U.S. dollar remaining flat. The Customs Gold Unit was unchanged. The official standard gold price was raised to 1147.3 yuan. Off-exchange pre-market trading opened at around 48 yuan. Fuxing, Yongda, Decheng, Richang, and Huixiang all sold, causing the price to drop to around 7 yuan. The morning opened lower, and after the opening, the price continued to weaken due to Huixiang's repeated aggressive selling of gold bars. The official HSBC exchange rates showed both the British pound and the U.S. dollar remaining flat. Yingxiang and others maintained support at lower levels, with occasional rallies, but Huixiang's selling appetite was strong. Speculators panicked at one point, but still failed to rally. The silver balancing tax was announced, rising by 1.25 points. After this, there was a slight improvement, but both buyers and sellers were active, resulting in a sideways trend at noon. The afternoon market opened peacefully, but supply exceeded demand, and the market gradually weakened. Speculators rushed to sell, and although major speculators maintained support at lower levels, the report of a 4-anna increase in the Indian silver price fueled the selling sentiment, ultimately leading to a continued decline. However, buying interest was strong after the low, and the market gradually stabilized. Today will mark the start of the April-May swap period. It is predicted that speculators will post offers of 5 yuan and 4 yuan. A record of today's market conditions is as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 1147.4 yuan, a decrease of 0.7 yuan compared to the previous close. Qingfa, Yongfu, Fuxing, Yongshang, and others bid up to 7.1 yuan. Huixiang sold heavily, causing the price to drop to 6.6 yuan. Fuxing, Yong, Huixiang, Chunyuan, Yong, Yingxiang, Yuanchang, Yong all bought, raising the price to 7 yuan. Huixiang, Hongkang, Yongdingkang sold again to 6.6 yuan. The official HSBC exchange rates showed both the British pound and the U.S. dollar remaining flat. Fuxing, Yongda, Decheng, Houyu, Yuanmao, Yong, Yingxiang bid up to 7 yuan again. Huixiang, Richang, Daheng sold again, causing the price to drop to 6.3 yuan. Yingxiang, Fuxing, Yongda, and Decheng maintained support at lower levels. The silver balancing tax was announced, rising by 1.25 points, raising the price back to 7 yuan. Fuxing, Yong, Huixiang, Xianghe, Qingfa, and Yong sold off at higher prices. The Shanghai branch of Banque Belge quoted the four-month U.S. dollar at 8.125, dropping to 6.5 yuan. Deli, Dachen, Richang, Yuanmao, Yongshang bid up to 7 yuan. Fuxing, Yong, Hongkang, Yongheng, Yu Huixiang sold off, retreating to 6.5 yuan. Dachen and Yuanmao Yong bought gold bars at lower prices. The noon closing price was 1146.6 yuan. The market stabilized after the close.</p>
<p>Afternoon Market: The opening price was 1146.6 yuan. Yuanmao and Decheng bid up to 6.8 yuan. Richang, Fuxing, Yong, Yuanmao, Huixiang, Xiangfeng, and Tongyi all sold, causing the price to drop to 6 yuan. Dafa and Yong Richang bid up to 6.2 yuan. Fuxing Yong then sold heavily.

<p>The foreign exchange market was even quieter yesterday due to a lack of activity among Chinese merchants. The process was extremely peaceful, and transactions were scarce. In the morning, foreign telegrams indicated that the London large-term forward rates were up 125 points in the near term and 0625 points in the far term.

Banks frequently engaged in mutual dealings, lacking outside activity, which led to this situation. The afternoon market was even quieter, and onlookers were even more bored, so the process was uneventful. Although the Indian silver price rose by 4.5 annas, the foreign exchange market was not particularly affected. Japanese banks still sold near-term East Asian exchange rates and bought far-term exchange rates.

<h3 id="e180">Securities   Government Bonds Hover with a Weak Appearance   Daily Trading Volume Less Than Three Million <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Closing Market Prices Only a Few Tens of Thousands</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange's market conditions reverted to sluggishness. Since the unified government bonds began trading on the 18th of last month, half a month has passed. Not only has trading been lackluster and hovering, but it also rose once, then immediately declined, ultimately failing to escape these two paths. It was impossible to have two consecutive days of gains or two consecutive days of losses. This shows that the strength aspect has been tested several times, all without effective results. Currently, there are still a large number of spot holders who either cannot form whole numbers due to odd amounts, or because there are no significant changes in the environment.  Demand for purchases is even scarcer; otherwise, it would have risen long ago.  Recently, two major domestic and international changes are still brewing.  The fundamentals of government bonds have undergone two reorganizations in four years, making it difficult for them to naturally rise.  Only a sharp drop can slightly arouse investment interest.  Maintaining them will be difficult to be optimistic about in the short term. Yesterday morning, when the market opened, Category E was slightly lower by one and a half cents. After that, Nos. 40 and 77 raised it, so the latter rose by one to three cents. In the second session, Category E only saw temporary short covering, hence a rise of one and a half cents. The rest, due to selling by Nos. 11 and 48, all turned negative, down slightly by three cents. The afternoon opening was quite inconsistent, with highs and lows interspersed, ranging from one to three cents. Closing trading volume decreased significantly. Only thirteen market price listings were available for the five types of government bonds, with most showing no change. Only Category E was down slightly by one cent. Overall, it was a picture of hovering with a weak appearance. As a result of market prices, Category A and B were still up by five to one and a half cents, domestic industry bonds were down by five cents, and Category E was down by three cents. The total transaction volume was only 2,865,000 yuan. The list of price changes and ratios is on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>According to a report from Sin Fung Trading Co. yesterday (the 12th), the New York stock market experienced a sharp decline. At the opening, Europe dumped shares, and each time the market stabilized, large quantities were released, causing market conditions to decline steadily. Mining, steel, and agricultural tools stocks all fell back to last month's levels. European clients dumped a large number of railroad stocks. Furthermore, due to reduced coal transportation, rail freight is expected to decrease sharply this week, making railroad stocks extremely weak. Small exchange stocks also fell, and a double-selling storm occurred in the bond market, causing prices to drop as well. The total daily trading volume was 2,920,000 shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is listed below.</p>

<p>The cotton market's surge is rampant. Due to the tight spot cotton situation and the firm overseas cotton markets, long positions are absorbing goods without budging. Shorts, seeing the favorable overall situation, are enduring the pain to cover. In the afternoon, rumors circulated that the political situation in France and Germany was urgent, benefiting the longs, and market prices jumped repeatedly. At the opening of the morning session for spot cotton, although U.S. spot cotton rose by five points, forward contracts fell by one to six points. Indian cotton rose by 0.5 to 1.25 rupees. Osaka Sampin cotton rose and fell by 1.2 cents. Market sentiment was flat, as most of the profit-taking longs had closed out their positions, loosening the market. All months fell by one to two cents. Towards the close, a certain company suddenly made a large purchase, and market prices jumped sharply. As a result, all months rose by five cents to two cents compared to the previous day's closing price. At the afternoon opening, market sentiment stabilized, with near-term contracts rising by two cents and far-term contracts falling by five cents. However, when bidding reached the second and third rounds, the rising wind of market prices suddenly arose, the situation was fierce, and the buying enthusiasm was particularly strong. Rumors circulated that the political situation in Europe was turbulent and unsettling, and buyers swarmed in. As a result, all months jumped significantly by 4.5 to 6.7 cents compared to the morning closing price. Sold: Jifeng 1,400 bales, Tongji 6,800 bales, Yukang 1,400 bales, Shenji 3,300 bales, Dachangcheng 2,300 bales, Changfeng 3,700 bales, Yuanxingchang 2,000 bales, Ruiyuan 2,200 bales, Dafeng 1,300 bales, Hexing 2,700 bales, Changji 1,200 bales, Run Kang 1,900 bales.

The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>The rising wind in the yarn market has revived, and the situation is unusually strong, truly due to the decreasing yarn inventory. Furthermore, the current spot yarn market price is increasing step by step, stirring people's hearts. Shorts, seeing the favorable environment, are actively covering their positions. The funds absorbed by the financial community have not been released. In the afternoon, market rumors said that the European political situation was still serious, and buyers were active, so the market soared violently.</p>
<p>Forward Yarn Exceeds 10 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>At the opening of the morning session for spot yarn, due to the flat situation of overseas cotton yarn and a lack of traders in the market, market prices were sluggish and motionless. In the second round, prices fell sharply by 6.7 cents. At the same time, spot yarn transactions were not smooth. Towards the third round, a certain company suddenly dragged in a large quantity, causing prices to suddenly jump. As a result, all months rose by 2.3 cents. The afternoon opening turned tight. Because the delayed delivery period for this month is approaching, shorts lack collateral for delivery, and the momentum is particularly tight. Distant months are being dragged into the predicament. In the second and third rounds, the rising wind became more intense. Due to rumors that the European situation was tense, people's hearts were looking up, and Osaka Sampin yarn initially fell but then recovered. As a result, all months rose by 1.3 yuan to 2.5 yuan compared to the afternoon closing price. The August contract rose above 210 yuan. Near-term contracts have already risen past the peak price of December 4th of last year.

<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened with sluggish conditions. All months were either unchanged or fell by seven points. The March contract was firm due to strong spot prices and the government's lack of sales. The remaining months were weak due to unfavorable Liverpool news, foreign merchants selling, cotton farmers hedging, and an unstable international political situation and stock market. Some people believe that the outbreak of war would benefit buyers, but there are also factors related to Washington. Before the close, fellow traders bought near-term contracts. As a result, the March contract and spot prices each rose by five points, while the remaining months fell by one to five points. English spot cotton fell by one point, and futures were either unchanged or fell by one point. The Indian cotton market was dim, with European exporters both buying and selling. Futures traders sold slightly. The price for Pingor rose by half a rupee, Oomra rose by 0.75 to 1.25 rupees, and Broach rose by 0.25 to 0.5 rupees.

<p>Yesterday in the local foreign firms' silk market, some new goods were already being sold, but export firms and manufacturers were all deeply concerned about the difficult market conditions and transaction prices. According to what this reporter has learned, White Steam Filature silk, B mark, with 20/22 denier, was priced at 700 yuan to 720 yuan. Lennards &amp; Firth and other firms all made purchases, with a transaction volume of 150 bales. It is said that the overseas silk market is weak, and the price difference between the overseas price and the Shanghai price is 50 yuan, so transactions have not been able to be prosperous. User firms continued to make transactions. Hangzhou spring silk sales are quite brisk, and B mark 20/22 is selling well. For example, Songbai and other brands were sold at 755 yuan yesterday, up by 15 yuan compared to before. The domestic market is gradually showing firmness.</p>

<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening in the morning, all months showed a consistent and sharp rise again. Regarding foreign wheat quotations, Chicago and Canada were both good at ten points. As the international situation is still pressing, people are generally fearing the outbreak of a European war, and all kinds of prices are bound to be affected. Therefore, outside buyers and a portion of the financial community are frequently absorbing large quantities, resulting in very smooth transactions for both near-term and far-term contracts, and prices are also rising (because it is said that Portuguese wheat has been set at 3-4,000 tons at a price of 6 yuan and 77 cents, so the upward trend is slightly weaker). When the afternoon market opened, it was initially still calm, but then outside buyers were still smooth, and there were receipts in every round, causing the market to improve by another one cent. The full-day increase was three to four cents for both near-term and far-term contracts. The total transaction volume reached about 1.2 million bags.</p>

<p>Yesterday in the wheat futures market, when the morning market opened, near-term contracts did not open, and contracts below June saw a flat market atmosphere because outside buyers were not smooth, and there were hedging sales from clients in producing areas. When the afternoon market opened, it was initially seen as calm, but then the flour market rose sharply, which also attracted the attention of outsiders. Therefore, transactions in each round were very smooth, and prices also rose step by step. However, because it was rumored that foreign wheat was being traded one after another, the upward trend was not too fierce. The spot wheat market is still stable, and prices are slightly better than the previous day by one to two cents. Shucheng Rongwan wheat was offered at 5 yuan and 17 cents, totaling more than 3,000 bags, and was purchased by the Third Factory.</p>
<p>Overseas Wheat   Canadian wheat export transactions were heard to total 2 million bushels, and it was also rumored that France was purchasing in Winnipeg (belonging to Canada).

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various gangs suddenly surged, with a total of more than 80 houses arriving (goods totaling more than 16,000 stones). Among them, Thin Dao (a type of rice) reached as many as 60 houses, so people's hearts suddenly became discouraged. In addition, sales on this street were not smooth, so the price of thick early Japonica rice fell by 20 to 30 cents. Although the purchasing volume of Thin Dao was still not weak, with Tianjin and Qingdao gangs purchasing more than 5,000 bags, it was ultimately reduced by 30 cents due to oversupply. The price of Du Yang Jian (a type of rice) fell slightly by 20 cents. The price of Yin Bian Yuan (a type of rice) was flat due to the scarcity of goods.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the weather was sunny, and the sources of various gangs from the river area surged vigorously, with as many as 45-46 houses. White Japonica rice was sluggish and no one asked about it, and the price fell slightly by 10 to 20 cents. The price of Yin Wu rice, which was high beyond measure the previous day, fell back by 20 to 30 cents in yesterday's market. The price of Bian Yuan (a type of rice) was slightly lower by a few cents.

<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian rice market suddenly changed. Because after several days of soaring prices, all production areas had shipments arriving. It was also affected by orders for foreign rice. Large-scale hoarding purchases not only stopped, but there was also a move to sell along with the market. The Ke Gang was watching with intent, and the purchasing volume on this street was not strong. For a time, the supply exceeded demand, and the market immediately saw a rebound. In the morning, the prices of various types of rice had fallen by several cents to tens of cents. In the afternoon, it continued to fall by about 10 cents. The total decline in the morning and afternoon was about 10 to 20 cents. Transactions also decreased sharply. Throughout the day, there were only 1,070 bags of Gan rice, 100 bags of Hunan oil rice, 300 bags of Min late rice, and 600 bags of Taiwan and Ningbo rice, all of which were purchased by this street.

<p>Yesterday, the market price of standard soybean cakes uniformly soared. It is said that the good sales of spot cakes and beans brought about the good results. The Dalian telegrams reported that oil rose by 10 to 20 cents, beans rose by about 10 cents, and cakes rose by 30 to 40 cents. After the opening in the morning, people's hearts and the market were improved by the consecutive rises in the Lian market. Following this, factories dumped a large amount of cake oil, and were urgently searching for spot beans in the market. More than 10,000 bags of Che Beans (a type of soybean) were offered, so standard beans were even more prosperous. Soybean cakes were enlivened by Ke Hua (a term for rural consumption) and were further brought up by the international situation. As a result, the price of standard Che Beans rose sharply by 15 to 16 cents, and the price of standard cakes rose by 4 to 6.5 cents. The price of standard oil also rose by 20 to 30 cents.</p>
<p>The spot soybean cake market situation was that the overall trend was more favorable than unfavorable, so the news was conducive to stopping the rise, and the market was also easy to inquire and pull up. Yesterday, the spot bean oil market was short of spot and was rising sluggishly, but because the Dalian market price continued to be high, the trend became tense. Four batches of spot transactions were opened, and the market price rose by more than ten cents. Peanut oil was thus brought up by 20 cents. The Shantou gang had a strong demand for soybean cakes, and the market price rose by two cents in the morning and afternoon. The current Four Brands Cake has been offered at 1 yuan and 77 cents, with delivery at the end of March to the beginning of April, and the price has risen from 1 yuan and 71 cents to 1 yuan and 73 cents.

There were also 2,600 to 2,700 bags of Du Bean (a type of soybean) and Shan Huang Bean traded. The market was still firm.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the trend of the sugar market was stable. The association divided the market with 24 yuan and 30 cents for raw granulated white spot, with few people going out. The price for re-exported goods was 7 yuan and 10 cents. Eastern red and white showed little change. Only the spot price of No. 8 white was offered at 5 cents less, at 21 yuan and 85 cents. The price of Ben Mian White Zhenji No. 1 was 20 yuan and 90 cents, with no change. Eastern red TBD mark was dumped by foreign firms, with 200 tons ready for shipment, and the price was 6 yuan and 20 cents in Japanese currency. The Hao market had Guangchao Gang offering several hundred bags of Hainan red, with the price at 12 yuan and 53 cents to 50 cents, rising back by tens of cents. Because the previous price of 40 cents was a cheap unloading by a certain company, it immediately showed an improvement. There were also more than 100 bags of Fan Red, at 12 yuan and 10 cents. Anhai Red was soft because of different sales routes, offered at 12 yuan and 50 cents, but did not sell. After the standard Wufu White Ice was sold out, the Hao Fang said yesterday that more than 100 pieces of the latter goods could arrive next Monday, but the cost had increased, and the goods king would have to increase the price again.</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Cooperative Society's standard exchange period was yesterday, and the transaction was still light. A total of 158 bags of Wuyang Raw White were transacted at 22 yuan and 10 cents, 150 bags of No. 2 You Cotton White were transacted at 21 yuan and 10 cents, and 40 bags of No. 4 You were transacted at 20 yuan and 90 cents. All the remaining Quxi Raw White and Medium Granulated White were not sold at the original price.</p>

<p>Sun-dried longan meat, such as goods from Tong'an and Zhangzhou, has been lacking in continued arrival for nearly two decades. The current Hao goods are sold out, and the stock in the market is also very scarce. According to inquiries, the front-end price of sun-dried meat at the dock was less than 100 yuan, and the market price had reached 97 to 98 yuan. According to recent Zhang News, the production price must be 95 yuan, which is equivalent to 105 yuan in Shanghai, so there is a lack of further arrival. Now that the Shanghai stock is scarce, the rear market looks tight and should have the possibility of approaching. Furthermore, the Lianzhou longan meat that was previously transported to Shanghai has recently been transported back to Hong Kong for good sales, which shows that the production price is high, and the Shanghai market will also rise accordingly. The Hainan meat market is relatively flat, but in the long run, it is also preventing it from becoming tight.</p>

<p>Our factory's round nails have recently seen brisk sales again in the customer's market. In the past two days, a total of more than 2,000 barrels were shipped to Sichuan, Changsha, Hankou, and other ports, and the price was 5 yuan and 75 cents per barrel. (Exports are subject to a tax of ten cents). (It seems to be about 10 cents cheaper than before, but scattered transactions are still offered at 5 yuan and 80 to 90 cents.) The Fujian gang has also been in contact recently, but because the price is very harsh, there is still no transaction. There is also a lack of large transactions among the construction gangs and small hardware shops on this street.</p>

<p>Haikou tree rubber (i.e., raw rubber material) has recently risen by another 2 yuan per 100 market pounds compared to before due to the lack of transportation for a long time and the increasingly scarce market stock. For example, No. 1 goods must be 54 yuan, and No. 2 goods must be 53 yuan. The lack of continued arrival of Singapore goods is even more firm.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Written After Women's Day <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>"March 8th" is International Women's Day. It is a memorial day for women to break free from shackles and strive for independent personalities. Naturally, the women's liberation movement is still only slowly progressing on a long and rugged road, far from its destination, and even more so in our Chinese women's community, which has the longest history of being shackled, the women's liberation movement seems even more naive. Therefore, this "March 8th" is undoubtedly only the first small firecracker of a women's movement, emitting a faint spark.</p>
<p>Although "March 8th" is only a small spark, it contains two great meanings: First, obtaining liberation from shackles; second, obtaining equal status after being liberated.</p>
<p>In China, "women's liberation" has obviously been developing in a localized and deformed way in recent years, seemingly limited to the student circles of a few major cities. In the student circles of major cities, at the very least, there is the freedom to criticize all unreasonable oppression of women. However, undoubtedly, once one steps out of school, or during vacations when returning to family, a large part will involuntarily make efforts for the liberation movement in a considerably unfree way. Because the environment of society and family still possesses strong barriers that women with considerable education cannot destroy, and everywhere there are traps and shackles that imprison women, opening their mouths, ready to swallow women - regardless of whether they are unliberated or liberated women.</p>
<p>Even a few liberated women, stepping into society and demanding a refuge after liberation with men standing on an equal footing, still show a situation of blurred vision. All that can be seen is a terrifying shadow. Regarding this level, we naturally cannot but attribute it to history, because our society is a society in which men have devoured women for thousands of years. However, men devouring women is an established historical fact, and the psychological construction required by the women's movement is precisely the effort to overthrow this established fact. However, the women's movement in the past, up to now, has obviously only focused on the incomplete and ununiversal liberation of women. As for what to do after the liberation that is better than nothing, has a considerable position been constructed to accommodate the rare liberated women? No one has bothered to ask. Therefore, the majority of the few liberated women, struggling out of old shackles, unknowingly fall into new traps. Although this is a social disadvantage, in fact, the short-sighted policy of the women's liberation movement cannot but be held responsible.</p>
<p>The author has a female cousin who fought for the right to receive higher education from stubborn parents and from the environment where "lack of talent is a virtue in women." During her school years, she also fought for the right to marital autonomy, and broke off the marriage with her incompetent fiancé, who was engaged to her by her parents at the age of thirteen. Although this caused a serious conflict with her family and suffered the pain of severe sanctions from the old society, she was able to fight with tenacious courage. However, after a short period of time, she had no choice but to serve the society due to the severance of family economic relations. Who knew that she was actually raped and became a concubine the year before last. By the time the secret was revealed, she was involved in a lawsuit in court, and after escaping the relationship, she had already become a woman rejected by her parents and clan. At present, although she is continuing her studies with a little alimony from her divorce, her future, naturally, still cannot find optimistic light.</p>
<p>Naturally, it is just one example. In recent years, I don't know how many similar events have occurred in the process of the women's movement, so I hope that everyone will commemorate "March 8th," recognizing the first important meaning, and must pay more attention to the second important meaning. Otherwise, "the women's movement" in China will suffer an unexpected failure and lead to a complete loss of effort.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Respect Your Wife, Cherish Your Children <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Chen Xuezhao</p>
<p>The elimination of the bourgeoisie in our country has brought about the elimination of bourgeois marriage forms.</p>
<p>However, it would be too false to say that everything is perfect in our family relationships, and that all relationships between families and between single men and women are peaceful. The truth is not so. We have given women all kinds of rights, we have opened up a path for them to work and live independently, but we have not yet removed the remaining oppression of capitalist society. This hateful oppression is always felt in family relationships in the Soviet state.</p>
<p>One example of these bourgeois remnants is the irresponsible and inconsiderate attitude of some individuals towards their family obligations.</p>
<p>The morally unstable elements in the people believe that the greatest freedom given by the October Revolution to men and women is the right to do immoral things in family life. Although such elements constitute only a small part of our population, their number is still too large because their wrongdoings go unpunished.</p>
<p>Conscious proletarians show respect for their families and their obligations, whether to their wives or parents. Only bourgeois priests and spoiled sons, who know they are bad elements in the family, still maintain their old habits. To say that thinking of family is a petty-bourgeois idea is only true for hypocritical bourgeois loafers.</p>
<p>Being a good member of a family is fulfilling a responsibility that we should fulfill. A bad member of a family will not be a good Soviet citizen, nor will they be a good worker in a social plan.</p>
<p>Although in our country, women have legal equality and economic independence, they are still the weaker part until society can fully educate all children: we should protect them because most of the people who neglect family responsibilities are always men.</p>
<p>In our country, no one has to be forced to continue their married life. We do not have ugly divorce cases. But the right to divorce given by Soviet law is not a right to immorality. Our laws assume that men and women know their responsibilities. But the responsibility of men is greater. A family without children loses its meaning, and the education of children requires a lot of work and attention. This work should be the joint responsibility of parents, and the law on child support should be strictly enforced. A father who abandons his wife and children and feels as free as a bird is a criminal. Courts that are tolerant of these fathers who only want to escape their responsibilities are also committing crimes.</p>
<p>Socialism wants to extend its protection to everyone so that the population can increase. Our youth are the healthiest in the world, both physically and mentally. Their character has gradually been shaped in the constant struggle for socialism and has been re-educated according to the ideas of evolution. This kind of thinking is not related to excessive lust or contempt for women. Bourgeois remnants will be completely eradicated.</p>
<p>This is the difference in our system: it is the glory of the Soviet people to educate their children and respect their wives and mothers.</p>
<p>Recently, some people in our country have advocated for new virtuous mothers and good wives. Virtuous mothers and good wives are certainly what we need, but it is still useless to have virtuous mothers and good wives without virtuous husbands and good fathers. I felt that this short article in the Russian newspaper strongly advocating for virtuous husbands and good fathers was meaningful, so I translated it. — Translator.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Understanding Prenatal Education <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Jiu Yong</p>
<p>Nowadays, some educators advocate for total human education, including prenatal education in addition to family education, school education, and social education, and they believe it is very important. This may be based on the development of human beings: when a fetus is in the mother's womb, it obtains nutrition and protection from the mother's body, and the mother's body and mind are sufficient to affect the fetus. Prenatal education is established under this "hypothesis," and all countries in the East and West acknowledge this.</p>
<p>In our country, Zhu Xi also described in his "Elementary Learning": "The Biography of Women says: 'In ancient times, when a woman was pregnant, she would not lie on her side, sit on the edge, or stand askew; she would not eat strange tastes, would not eat meat that was not properly cut, would not sit on a mat that was not properly placed, would not look at obscene colors, would not listen to lewd sounds; at night, she would have a blind musician recite poems and talk about proper matters. In this way, the child born would have a proper appearance and be exceptionally talented.'" This illustrates that the mother should pay attention to the norms of daily life during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Even in our folk customs, there are similar legends and stories, but they are tinged with excessive superstition.</p>
<p>As for the educational value of prenatal education, we do not ask about its effects, but a mother who pays such attention to the fetus is truly educating her son. From an educational point of view, the influence of the mother's education that we expect is actually greater than the value of prenatal education itself. From a scientific point of view, we use today's scientific knowledge to explain:</p>
<p>Chronic and acute diseases of the mother's body are harmful to the fetus.</p>
<p>Prolonged worries, emotional depression, laziness, and overwork of the mother's body are harmful to the mother's nutrition and directly harmful to the fetus's physical development.</p>
<p>The mother's intake of poisons and toxic substances can damage reproductive cells and affect the fetus's body and mind.</p>
<p>Syphilis transmitted in utero can also harm the development of the fetus.</p>
<p>From this, we can imagine what kind of health care the mother needs during pregnancy. Zhu Xi's description is indeed very consistent with scientific views.</p>
<p>However, medical scholars do not recognize these, except for the mechanisms that can affect the fetus's body, the relationship between the mother's body and the fetus is only that the mother's body provides blood to the fetus. Although nutritional disorders, poisoning, and diseases of the mother's body are transmitted to the fetus through the blood, these adverse effects are not detected. They believe that rather than fearing mothers who do not pay attention to prenatal education, it is better to pay attention to spiritual education after birth.</p>
<p>In our understanding, future prenatal education should be based on genetic instructions and the lessons of eugenics, pay attention to the conditions of ideal partners, and pay attention to hygiene during pregnancy, in order to produce babies with excellent qualities.</p>

<h3 id="e199">A Record of Madam Huang Keqiang <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Qian</p>
<p>Revolutionary martyr Huang Keqiang has made great contributions in the glorious history of our nation's revolution. His wife, Ms. Xu Zonghan, is also a heroine among women. After Huang's death, she resolutely continued her husband's aspirations, constantly fighting against the evil forces of the Northern Government. Being eager for public good and righteousness seems to be her innate character. Whenever there is a national salvation movement, she always helps with all her might. I remember during the May Fourth Movement in the eighth year of the Republic of China, student associations were established in various places. She then organized the Women's Federation in Shanghai, and from the Women's Federation, she took the lead in organizing the National Federation of All Circles. It was truly a call from the heights, and all the mountains responded. Industrial, commercial, academic, and other groups from various provinces and regions sent representatives to participate. At that time, to arouse the public and lead to such a phenomenon of popular enthusiasm, she naturally had a considerable contribution. Moreover, when the Shanghai people fought against the warlords, she always served as the vanguard, often leading female comrades to rush into the ranks of the military police. The military police were instead pushed back by them, and the male comrades often gained safety because of this. Since the Revolutionary Army established its capital in Nanjing, she saw that the revolution had been successful, but she still did not want to enjoy a comfortable life, so she founded the Poor Children's Training Institute, specializing in educating and raising general impoverished children. Over the years, she has cultivated no less than a thousand people. The facilities in the institute are very complete, and the main courses are about teaching industrial and vocational skills, such as wireless telegraphy, typing, sewing, weaving towels and socks, and various rattan products, so that students can make a living after graduation. The students who graduate each year should naturally leave the institute according to the regulations, but because the students do not have the ability to be economically independent, many still refuse to leave the institute. She understands the students' difficulties, so she does her best to find a way out for them, recommending them to various public and private factories. However, as time goes by and the number of people increases, recommendations also gradually become difficult, so graduation season becomes her major hurdle. For the sake of the graduates' future, she is often so tired that she forgets to eat and sleep. From this, one can see her painstaking efforts to serve the public. If the wives of all the great men in the country were like this Madam Huang, not only would the poor children of the whole country be saved, but China would have been saved long ago.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Cooking Knowledge <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Vegetarian Ham: Everyone knows that ham is made from pork legs, so how can it be vegetarian? But the vegetarian ham I am talking about is made from tofu skin. First, soak ten or twenty sheets of tofu skin in good soy sauce, add dried shrimp, large ones soak for an hour, then take them out, stack them one by one, and mix the dried shrimp and soy sauce into the skin, then roll them up, into a long strip the size of a silver dollar, then wrap it in a clean cloth, and tie it tightly with rope on the outside. After it is tied, put it in a coarse bowl and steam it over water. Steam the large ones for two hours, then take them out and cut them into pieces the size and thickness of silver dollars. It is very delicious. If you eat it with porridge, it is very suitable.</p>
<p>Sugar Sweet Potato: Use native sweet potato (red skin and red heart, if there is no native sweet potato, you can also use foreign sweet potato). Remove the skin, cut it into round pieces, and fry it in soybean oil until it turns yellow (you must fry them one by one to fry them thoroughly). Then add water, white sugar, and lard and cook them together for one or two hours, then they will be cooked until soft. It is sweet and delicious to eat and is a good afternoon snack.</p>
<p>Pork Floss: Use several pounds of pork, remove the skin and fat, leaving only the lean meat (i.e., lean meat), wash it clean, add soy sauce, wine, green onions, ginger, etc., and braise it according to the method of braising pork. Then use chopsticks to break the meat into shreds, then cook it again. When the soup is about to dry, stir it with chopsticks again. When the soup is cooked dry, add sesame oil and stir-fry with a shovel for about one or two hours, then you can stir-fry it until crispy. Take it out of the pot at any time and put it in a ceramic jar. However, the jar lid must be covered after the pork floss has cooled completely, otherwise it will easily become soft and not crispy.

<h3 id="e201">Snake (4) <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Wang Yin Jiu</p>
<p>After exchanging a few pleasantries, they soon arrived at Deyue Lou, and picked a table upstairs to sit down.</p>
<p>"Your little official must have been quite frightened that day? I happened to see it with my own eyes!" After drinking a cup of tea, Wu Er first mentioned the main topic. Without Yu Zhongqing questioning him, he described as much as possible the situation of how everyone brought a red-banded snake to scare the little mute: he just moved himself from an active position to a bystander's position.</p>
<p>"So that's how it is! Yu Zhongqing sighed, seemingly very sad, after listening.</p>
<p>"Mr. Yu, what's strange is indeed very strange," The two walnuts in Wu Er's hands were still clattering. "Your little official was never known to be timid. I never saw him afraid of anything. In terms of strength, I, Wu Er, admire him even more. But I don't understand why he's so... so afraid of snakes?"</p>
<p>Yu Zhongqing did not answer immediately. He first looked at Wu Er's eager face with a pair of bright, spirited eyes, at which time he already understood the intention of this busybody who had specially invited him to tea, but he was also unwilling to disappoint Wu Er, and finally told the truth.</p>
<p>"Brother Wu Er, you see that I am now a peaceful farmer," Yu Zhongqing shook the blue cloth short jacket he was wearing. "But I used to be a heartless military officer, you may also know. And before that? Our family were all hunters. Decades ago, in Hunan, our Yu family in Xiangyin was quite well-known. It's not that I'm bragging, but no matter how ferocious a beast was, it wouldn't think about going back if it ran into us. But it's sad to say: my grandfather and father hunted tigers, leopards, wolves and so on all their lives, and never missed a shot, but in the end they both died from snake venom... One died with his whole body festering, and the other was swollen bigger than an ox, almost unable to fit into a coffin..."</p>
<p>A look of anger and fear gradually welled up on Yu Zhongqing's face, which made Wu Er feel a little hair-raising.</p>
<p>"Before their death, they both said that snakes were the most sinister things, and even the greatest heroes should still avoid them if they see them. From then on, the people in our family warned each other to run away when they saw a snake. But my second brother didn't believe it. His kung fu was also the best, and he was determined to avenge his father and grandfather. Once he saw a snake, he had to chop it to death before he would stop. It turned out that one time he chopped a small green snake less than three feet long into three pieces. Seeing that it was dead, he was too lazy to bury it. The next day, when he walked by, he saw that only the middle and end sections were left. He looked for a long time, but still couldn't find the head section. Just as he was about to walk back, he suddenly felt something wiggling in his crotch. He hurriedly pulled off his pants, but it was too late. That section of the snake's head had desperately drilled into his anus, so of course it was over!"</p>
<p>Wu Er listened with a mix of fear and fascination, and unconsciously stared blankly at Yu Zhongqing's bitter smile.</p>
<p>"At that time, my child was only four years old, but he already understood things. Seeing his uncle rolling on the ground for two days and two nights before dying, he was scared to death. After that, as long as we mentioned the word 'snake,' he would be scared and cry." Yu Zhongqing sighed again when he said this: "So today, I sincerely thank you, Brother Wu Er, for asking about this matter, and I will honestly tell you, and by the way, I beg you to say hello to all the neighbors and don't joke with my little mute again! I am truly grateful!"</p>
<p>Wu Er couldn't help but hit his own leg twice to express his deep regret. When he looked at Jin Zhongqing again, his eyes were already completely red. (End)</p>
<p>Special Report from This Newspaper</p>
<h3 id="e202">A Ten-Minute Meeting with Madam Mei Huaquan <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Chinese women are not incompetent, but it is a pity that few are aware. To fight for equal rights between men and women, one must first develop one's own strength. To adapt to the trends of the times, one must encourage learning and cultivate morality.</p>
<p>Madam Mei Huaquan is a pioneer in advocating for the women's movement and is enthusiastic about social undertakings. The women's circles in Shanghai all recognize her as a leader. I have also admired her name for a long time, so I decided to visit her, hoping to report her twenty years of experience in presiding over the women's movement to the general women, so that everyone can get a correct concept. Although our conversation was only ten minutes, her very sincere and thorough words can be considered to be pertinent.</p>
<p>Madam Mei is originally from Guangdong and was born in Hong Kong. When she was six or seven years old, she followed her kind mother to visit Penang and Xiangshan, where she lived for ten years before studying at Columbia University in the United States, studying education. She was a classmate of Mr. Mei. After returning to China and getting married, she has lived in Shanghai for more than twenty years. She said that the reason why she is willing to serve society is because she received all kinds of stimulation overseas when she was young and felt that a woman must work hard in society. Like Hawaii and the United States, there are traces of our overseas Chinese everywhere. Regardless of whether they are men or women, they have always been discriminated against unequally by foreigners. The weakness of national power is certainly a major reason, but the low level of knowledge of overseas Chinese is also closely related. I am a woman, a knowledgeable woman, how can I improve the ability of my female compatriots? To win an equal position internationally? That was my established ambition. In those days, the wives of our country's ambassadors and consuls abroad were also old-fashioned in their thinking and did not know international etiquette, so there were many disadvantages in the international position. Foreigners ridiculed us Chinese as not an excellent nation. Do you think you can stand the injustice? Later, when I arrived in Shanghai, I decided to fight for the status of my female compatriots and change the international attitude of contempt for my female compatriots.</p>
<p>At that time, there were hardly any women's organizations in Shanghai, so we contacted the pioneers of the women's circles, gathered our strength, organized together, and worked together for society. First, we established the National Association of Young Women's Christian Associations as a vanguard team to promote women's sports, study women's health, and handle women's supplementary education; to improve the efficiency of women's intellectual, moral, and physical education. Fortunately, with the help of all walks of life, there has been considerable success in recent years. I have worked in this association for twenty years and have been the president for seven years, and I have put in a lot of energy. In addition, the International Council of Women and the Chinese Women's Association are also two major organizations that I serve. Today, international women in Shanghai not only feel that Chinese women are not incompetent, but also believe that the spirit of service of Chinese women may be stronger than theirs. It is a pity that there are still too few comrades, and we have not reached the entire female masses.</p>
<p>According to her twenty years of experience in guiding the women's movement, she feels that the intelligence of Chinese women is not lower than that of Western women, but their physical strength is slightly inferior. She deeply feels that most women in the upper class lack social thought and national concepts. They only care about their own enjoyment and waste their precious time in improper entertainment. If they spend a little more time, put in a little more effort, and donate a little more money, to think about the poor masses and seek the interests of women themselves, then social reform will definitely be hopeful. Although the economic situation of women in middle-class families is slightly worse, they can set aside time and energy to contribute to society. They must first train their own abilities, develop their personal ambitions, and strive to understand everything that is unclear, be diligent in learning, and not bury their own ambitions solely for the sake of the family. As for poor women, it is really pitiful to say, they work hard all year round and cannot get enough food and clothing. Although we have the grand wish to provide relief, it is difficult to popularize a drop in the bucket. This is a problem of the entire political, economic, and social system, and it is not easy to improve without the power of the state. She also said that Shanghai is such a big city, and the Young Women's Christian Association still rents other people's houses, has no land, and has no funds, not to mention not being as good as foreign countries, but also not as good as the Young Women's Christian Associations in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Beijing. In this regard, she deeply regrets the cold attitude of most women in Shanghai towards social undertakings!</p>
<p>Madam Mei also talked about her own family. She said that we are an organization of a new family. There are no elders above, and everything is decided by my husband and I. Now there are two children, one male and one female, who are both in school. Family life takes a simple and economical approach. I have always taken care of household affairs in the morning, and worked for the above three women's organizations in the afternoon. In recent years, the affairs of the association have become more developed than before, so daily matters can be considered trivial, but I am very interested in this and do not feel tired at all. Finally, I asked her what Chinese women should do to meet the needs of modern times? She thought for a while and said very calmly: "The so-called era and the so-called trend are constantly changing, but for us women, regardless of how it changes, it is most important to diligently seek knowledge and cultivate morality. With knowledge and morality, we can adapt to the needs of the times. Women should contribute their surplus energy to society in addition to fulfilling their duties. Some people raise their hands and shout for equal rights between men and women, but they only enjoy themselves. I do not approve of this..."</p>
<p>I only talked to her for ten minutes, but her calmness and sincerity left a very deep impression.</p>

<p>— Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>Women's diseases. Menstrual diseases are the most complex. Whether too much or too little. Whether early or late. Whether flooding or leaking. Whether dark or light. There are even those with uterine cold causing pain. Abdominal pain during menstruation is a condition that afflicts the most women. It is generally caused by a lack of endocrine secretion in the female gonads and uterine inflammation. If female gonadal preparations are prescribed, then the medicine will be effective. The disease will be cured. Even various menstrual disorders will be resolved. Moreover, female gonadal preparations have the functions of eliminating inflammation, warming the uterus, soothing the fetus, ensuring safe childbirth, promoting milk production, inducing pregnancy, regulating menstruation, and treating leucorrhea, so they are the supreme holy medicine for gynecology.</p>
<p>Patient Mrs. Sun Jibo. Always feels cold abdominal pain during menstruation. And suffers from leucorrhea. Resulting in infertility after a long marriage. Came to see me last spring. I instructed her to purchase "Female Reproductive Hormone" for internal use and "Leucorrhea Cure" for external use from Wing On Company. Self-treated according to the law. After a month or so, it was completely cured. Mr. Sun sent a letter of thanks at the beginning of winter. Saying that his wife had given birth at full term. And happily obtained a boy.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Different Medicines for Nocturnal Emission and Premature Ejaculation <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation. Are generally confused as one. Those who hear it are accustomed to it and do not examine it. Thinking that one medicine can cure it. In fact, the root causes are slightly different. One is the insecurity of the sperm gate. The other is the easy excitation of the sexual nerves. Therefore, the use of medicine should also be slightly different. Patients who have been treated repeatedly without effect. Should quickly reflect on themselves.</p>
<p>Patient Ma Duoye. Committed masturbation when young. Resulting in nocturnal emission. Was unrestrained after marriage. And suffered from premature ejaculation. Repeatedly took ordinary tonic preparations. All were of no great effect. Came to see me last autumn. I instructed him to purchase two famous medicines from Wuzhou Pharmacy. "Hemitol's Sperm Strengthening Tablets" and "Reproductive Hormone". Because the medicine was effective and took care of the source of the disease. So in less than a month. It was completely cured. Vitality was reborn. The body recovered health. Before and after, it was like two different people.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Stomach Pain Stomach Pain is Not Difficult to Cure <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Bofu</p>
<p>Bone pain is a symptom. With different sources of disease. Or caused by external wind and dampness. Leading to aching pain. Or caused by residual toxins not being cleared. Entering the bones and causing suffering. If the prescription is appropriate. And the medicine is effective. Then it will search for toxins and remove dampness. Taking care of everything. Even if the hands and feet are numb. And the whole body is paralyzed and disabled. It is not difficult to get up easily.</p>
<p>The source of stomach pain. Has been discussed in detail in previous issues of this journal. If the medicine has the dual effects of removing inflammation, relieving acid, protecting the membrane, and eliminating accumulation. Then the medicine will be effective. Even long-standing and intractable stubborn diseases will not be difficult to cure radically.</p>
<p>Patient Zheng Yutang. Suffered from both bone pain and stomach pain. This one subsided and the other arose. Suffering was unbearable. Repeated medication was ineffective. Thinking it was incurable. Delayed for many years. Until he came to see me last autumn. I prescribed a prescription and instructed him to purchase three famous medicines from Zhongxi Pharmacy. "Strongston's Bone Pain Tablets", "Stomach Pain Relief", and "Stomach Strengthening 素". After taking the medicines, the effect was significant. Immediately took several boxes in a row with peace of mind. The pain disappeared completely. The whole body was light and healthy. Like a living dragon and a fierce tiger.</p>

<p>— Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Opium is a poison. Inhaling it chronically poisons the nerves, leading to paralysis. Once addicted, one cannot stop. Stopping immediately results in tears, yawning, and unbearable mental weakness. This is the principle of addiction. If there were a good remedy that could eliminate the opium toxins, remove the illness, invigorate the spirit, and strengthen the body and mind, then the opium addiction could be broken, achieving the success of safely quitting opium.</p>
<p>Recently, the deadline for quitting is imminent and cannot be delayed. Compatriots listed in the "black books" (opium addicts) are in a precarious situation. However, the pain experienced during withdrawal is frequent, and the mental suffering is intense. Coupled with the fear of surgery and reluctance to be hospitalized, many attempts to quit opium are abandoned halfway, failing at the last step. This is truly lamentable.</p>
<p>Last autumn, a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Yue Shiqi, came to me for consultation. They complained of stomach pain and nocturnal emission occurring simultaneously during the withdrawal period, causing mental exhaustion. I instructed them to purchase and take "Male Reproductive Extract" and "Female Reproductive Extract" from the French Pharmacy as the main treatment, along with "Stomach Pain Relief," "Digestive Aid," and "Schmidt's Sperm Strengthening Pills" to treat their stomach pain and nocturnal emission. After about a month, they successfully and safely quit opium and left.</p>

<p>(Mr. Fei Chunsheng writes:) My younger brother, Shusheng, is at the age of development, but he is physically weak and has not developed well. He has sought treatment repeatedly and taken various tonics, but without effect. He often suffers from dizziness, tinnitus, lower back pain, insomnia, forgetfulness, palpitations, and night sweats. His condition is constantly changing, and his spirit is declining. Last autumn, as his wedding date approached, he wrote to this publication for advice. He was informed that the cause of his incomplete development was a lack of endocrine function in the reproductive glands. He immediately followed the instructions and purchased "Reproductive Extract" from the Anglo-Chinese Pharmacy. After taking it, the effect was remarkable. He continued to take several boxes, and each symptom gradually disappeared. His blood became rich, his spirit strong, his body healthy, and he achieved good development, the best he has ever experienced since birth.</p>

<p>(Mr. Mao Zhiyun writes:) When I was young and ignorant, I mistakenly indulged in the bad habit of masturbation. I relied on my strength and did not care. Later, when I became thin and weak, with kidney deficiency and back pain, I realized the harm and stopped on my own. However, I was already suffering from insomnia and nocturnal emission. Medication was ineffective, the frequency of nocturnal emission increased, and the insomnia worsened. (Omitted). Last autumn, I wrote to this publication and was instructed to purchase "Reproductive Extract" and "Schmidt's Sperm Strengthening Pills" from Wing On Company. After taking about half a dozen of each, the insomnia was cured, and the nocturnal emission was also treated. I regained my strength and did not need to seek further treatment in Chongqing.</p>

(Medical history) – Mr. Lu was handsome and inherited his father's business at a young age. At the age of 19, he took over full authority in the factory.

Moreover, Mr. Lu was ordered by his parents to marry at the age of 18, and he engaged in unrestrained sexual activity, further suffering from sperm thinning and mental weakness. Last autumn, his body became abnormally weak, and he was averse to labor and trouble, which hindered his duties. He sought treatment from me. (Presenting symptoms) – Neurasthenia, prolonged infertility. (Treatment) – I diagnosed that the root of Mr. Lu's illness was the decline of the reproductive glands, which could not be effectively treated by ordinary preparations and tonics. I instructed him to purchase "Reproductive Extract" from Jihuatang Pharmacy. Because the medication was targeted to the symptoms, all symptoms were eliminated within a month, achieving the most satisfactory and effective result.</p>

Although it was cured, residual toxins remained, causing constant bone and joint pain. In recent years, it has worsened, and he also feels numbness in his hands and feet. He also suffers from insomnia at night, frequent dreams, and nocturnal emission during sleep. Afterward, the frequency of nocturnal emission increased from several times a month to more than ten times a month. His body was extremely depleted and could not be supported.

<h3 id="e216">A Shortcut to Treating Acne and Freckles <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— (Jingcheng)</p>
<p>The cause of acne is the excessive accumulation of sebum in the sebaceous glands or the blockage of the sebaceous gland openings. During puberty, our sebaceous glands secrete more sebum, or obstructions such as hair follicle parasites and dirt block the sebaceous excretory ducts, hindering sebum excretion, thus causing this condition. Therefore, acne is common in young people. The symptoms are small papules protruding from the sebaceous gland openings, like sesame seeds, with black or purple tips. If pressed with a fingernail, there is a rice-like fatty nodule inside. The locations where this condition occurs are the forehead, nose, and cheeks, but it can also occur on the chest and back, although this is rare. Freckles are named freckles because their spots resemble the spots on a sparrow's feathers. They can occur on all parts of the body, but they are most often seen on the face. They are almost indistinguishable from summer spots. Summer spots appear in summer and disappear in winter, while freckles remain all year round. They often appear in childhood and become more prominent during puberty. The cause is a congenital change in skin quality. Since acne and freckles are the most common facial skin disorders for us, methods for treating these two conditions are also the most needed for us. In view of this, Shanghai Tongren Western Drug Company has invented a kind of "Mianli" cream, which specializes in treating acne and freckles, and has remarkable results. Since its sales, it has spread throughout the country, which is enough to be a shortcut for the treatment of those suffering from freckles and acne.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Hairpon Cures Neurasthenia <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— (Lu Xunru, submitted manuscript)</p>
<p>Due to congenital and acquired deficiencies, I was weak and sickly since childhood. Last year, I enrolled in high school, and the coursework was more demanding. Due to excessive brain use, I suffered from insomnia at night and even frequent nightmares and nocturnal emissions. During the day, I often had dizziness, headaches, tinnitus, limb fatigue, and memory loss, which caused great pain. I had to take leave to seek medical treatment, but my neurasthenia remained the same. The phenomenon of nocturnal emission also remained the same. My studies were greatly affected. This year, I returned home for summer vacation. I happened to talk to my cousin, who said that he had also suffered from similar symptoms due to masturbation. Later, he purchased two bottles of "Hairpon" for brain and sperm strengthening from Shanghai Tongren Western Drug Company for 4 yuan. After taking them for two weeks, all the diseases disappeared, and he felt very comfortable. After listening to his words, I also remitted money to purchase two bottles. After taking them, the effect was very good, which was unexpected. When I returned to Shanghai for the autumn semester, my body and spirit were much better than before. How can "Hairpon" not be named the special medicine for neurasthenia?</p>
<h3 id="e218">Psoriasis <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— (Zhu Qiuyuan)</p>
<p>Psoriasis, also known as scaly ringworm, is a skin disease caused by nerve and blood vessel disorders. Its nature is extremely stubborn, often lasting for more than ten years. At first, the skin develops rash-like spots or small nodules, forming irregular circles, dark red in color. After a period of time, the surface is covered with silvery-white scales. If the scales are removed, blood stains are visible. Later, the surrounding area gradually expands, winding into a map-like shape, while the center gradually fades. If left untreated for a long time, it spreads widely, often from head to toe, and the skin becomes red and covered with layers of scales. Psoriasis occurs on the neck, palms, soles, and extensor surfaces of the elbow and knee joints, often causing severe itching. Treatment methods include medication, radium therapy, or X-ray irradiation. For medication treatment, "Ganlu" from Tongren Western Drug Company is the best. "Ganlu" uses the correct medications and is legally formulated. Each bottle sells for 1 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Radical Cure for Stomach Pain <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— (Yinchu)</p>
<p>Why does the stomach hurt? It is because of stomach disease. Why does the stomach become diseased? It is because the stomach's digestion deviates from the norm. When food enters the stomach, gastric juice is secreted due to its stimulation. The sphincter muscle of the pylorus also contracts, stopping the food in the stomach. The stomach wall continues to churn, mixing the gastric juice with the food. After a certain period of time, the food turns into a thick porridge. Then, the sphincter muscle of the pylorus relaxes, and the stomach wall churns, discharging the porridge into the duodenum. If digestion deviates from the norm, the sensory nerves of the stomach become excited, resulting in stomach pain. Often, belching and vomiting occur. After the attack, the person feels relieved. There are also repeated attacks. Patients often have a heavy head, headache, cold limbs, mental depression, and poor appetite, leading to gradual weight loss and reduced body resistance. All kinds of diseases arise. People in our country often neglect hygiene, so stomach pain is particularly common. Now, Shanghai French Concession West Xinqiao Street Dexing Lane No. 1, Tongren Western Drug Company, has invented a special medicine called "Weibiling," which is most effective for treating stomach pain. It does not contain any anesthetic ingredients. Its purpose is to transform the function of the stomach and restore it to health. It is truly an essential medicine for the family. In my clinical practice, whenever I encounter stomach pain, I always instruct the patient to take "Weibiling." Its efficacy is better than any other stomach medicine. After taking "Weibiling," not only is the effect rapid, but it can also prevent recurrence forever. My motivation for introducing it lies in this.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Gratitude for Leukorrhea Cure <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— (Rao Zuolin, Hankou)</p>
<p>My wife, Jinping, has had excessive leukorrhea since last winter. She has been treated by doctors for more than half a year, and she has taken more than twenty doses of decoction, but it was like throwing a needle into the ocean, resulting in thin muscles, sallow skin, and a weakening body. At that time, she was still nursing a four-month-old child. Later, she could no longer breastfeed. We didn't even know where this disease came from. Although it is said that nine out of ten women have leukorrhea, it is unlikely to be so severe. This spring, I purchased "Internal Leukorrhea Pills" and "External Leukorrhea Medicine" from Shanghai Tongren Western Drug Company. I took two boxes of each of these two medicines, and she gradually recovered. Her complexion and strength also gradually improved. The cost was only three yuan per box, which is truly a fortunate thing. Feeling grateful, I wrote a few lines to express my thanks.</p>
<h3 id="e221">A Few Words on Treating Gonorrhea <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— (Yuyuan)</p>
<p>All gonorrhea is caused by sexual intercourse with an unclean person, infecting gonorrhea bacteria. The gonorrhea bacteria invade the mucous membrane of the urethral opening, causing inflammation, redness, and swelling. Therefore, there is a burning sensation in the urethra, sharp pain during urination, and dripping pus. This is the nature of the disease, so there is no need to be afraid. It is best to seek treatment from a specialist hospital as soon as possible. Do not listen to others lightly and take random prescriptions. Needles and blades cut the skin, and it still takes time to heal. How can gonorrhea be any different? Those who do not understand the truth only know to use a single astringent medicine, regardless of the benefits and harms of the disease. At first, it seems effective, the dripping stops, but after a short time, it drips out again, even more severely than before. They do not know that the gonorrhea bacteria are still lurking under the urethral mucosa, taking the opportunity to gradually ascend and spread to the posterior urethra. Then, cystitis, prostatitis, epididymitis, and other symptoms arise one after another. The more it is astringed, the worse it gets, until it becomes irreversible, misleading the whole life. This is all due to the pursuit of temporary merit. Therefore, those who are good at treating gonorrhea must know that gonorrhea cannot be stopped. Internal medicine should choose antibacterial and diuretic drugs, which are beneficial and harmless. "Gonadoden" is a special medicine for treating gonorrhea. It has the function of penetrating the membrane, killing bacteria, diuresis, clearing turbidity, reducing inflammation, and relieving pain. The results of treating gonorrhea are particularly remarkable. Now, Chinese and foreign doctors are happy to use it. The price is two yuan per bottle. It is sold by Tongren Western Drug Company, Yuhao, Dexing Lane, West Xinqiao Street, French Avenue, Shanghai. It is the only savior for those suffering from gonorrhea who treat themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Nocturnal Emission <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— (Hairong)</p>
<p>There are many treatments for nocturnal emission, artificial and medicinal. But often the effectiveness is not colorful. Why? The two do not complement each other. Therefore, all internal medicines for nocturnal emission should be supplemented by artificial methods to enhance their medicinal power. The effect has never been unnoticeable. However, the choice of medicines must be strict, otherwise the effort will be wasted and the money will be wasted. The best medicine for nocturnal emission is one that strengthens the sperm and nourishes the yuan. Only those that can strengthen the sperm are second best. Anyone who suffers from nocturnal emission must be weak. If the body is weak, the sperm cannot be consolidated. Therefore, strengthening the sperm must first nourish the yuan. The principle is very clear. Otherwise, giving up the tree and chasing the branches, I see that it cannot be effective. Shanghai French Concession West Xinqiao Street, Dexing Lane No. 1, Tongren Western Drug Company's "Hairpon" tablets have this effect. If patients can purchase this medicine and implement artificial methods, they will have twice the result with half the effort. The so-called artificial method is nothing more than the following items. (1) Avoid drinking tea or smoking and drinking before going to bed. (2) Go to bed early and get up early. It is best to get up at dawn. (3) Rub your body with cold water before going to bed and do 10 to 15 minutes of indoor exercise. (4) Keep the bowel movements smooth. (5) Do not read improper books and have improper thoughts. (6) Take outdoor walks on holidays to breathe fresh air. If you do this consistently, it will definitely be effective.</p>

<p>— (Yuwen)</p>
<p>There are many medicines for treating ringworm. I have never heard of anything as effective as Ganlu. The most important thing for any medicine for treating ringworm is five things. No irritation is one thing. It is not absorbed by the skin and does not induce nephritis is two things. It can stop itching is three things. It has strong bactericidal power and no side effects is four things. It does not stain clothes, has no oil stains, and has a fragrant smell is five things. Ganlu has all five of these. It is suitable for its magical effect in treating ringworm.</p>
<p>(Editor's note. Ganlu is sold by Shanghai French Concession, West Xinqiao Street, Dexing Lane No. 1, Tongren Western Drug Company. It specializes in treating dry and wet scabies, old ringworm of many years, itchy rash, yellow water sores, sitting board sores, inguinal ringworm, tinea cruris, white ringworm, and yellow ringworm. It is indeed effective and truly worthy of the name Ganlu. The price is one yuan per bottle.)</p>

<p>— (Ye Xiong)</p>
<p>I have also studied the art of drug manufacturing. However, I have never seen the use of medicines as appropriate and the formulation as suitable as "Mianli." Because the raw materials used in "Mianli" are extremely noble, and its formulation is completely the latest scientific method, its therapeutic effect is far from comparable to other beauty products. Whether patients have freckles or acne, if they apply "Mianli" every day, the effect is very rapid, often surprising people. Moreover, regular application can whiten the skin and prevent the occurrence of freckles and acne. Therefore, it is very popular among young men and women and praised by the medical community. My family, relatives, and friends also use it and have good results. I am happy to record it.</p>

<p>(1) Must state name and address, and attach return postage.</p>
<p>(2) Briefly state the course of the disease and the points to be asked.</p>
<p>(3) Please send letters to Shanghai Post Office Box 1616, Medical Journal Editorial Department.</p>
<p>Has a Stomach Problem</p>
<p>I have had a stomach problem for a long time. It comes and goes. I didn't pay attention to it. But a month ago, I attended a banquet for relatives. I came back from eating my fill. My stomach problem broke out. I lost sleep and appetite. It is still like this now. I am in unbearable pain. Because I am limited by economics, I have not been able to come to Shanghai for treatment. Please give me a good prescription. I will be grateful forever. (Zhang Zai Nian asks)</p>
<p>(Answer) The medicine "Weibiling" is very effective in treating stomach problems. You can buy it. The price is one yuan per box. It is sold by Tongren Western Drug Company in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Covered in Pimples</p>
<p>I heard people say that pimples are a phenomenon that a young person must go through. It is said that it is related to development. Since this year, my face has been covered in pimples. Recently, several friends who have the same pimples as me have all been cured with "Mianli." But I don't know if there will be any other harm after it is cured. (Xiong Xiang Sun asks)</p>
<p>(Answer) The symptom of pimples is caused by excessive secretion of sebum in young people. At the same time, due to the obstacle of secretion, the phenomenon of pimples occurs at the sebaceous gland opening. Using "Mianli" to treat it is not only effective, but also does not cause any harm.</p>
<p>A Lifetime Burden</p>
<p>I have been suffering from gonorrhea for three years. It comes and goes. It can be said to be a lifetime burden. I have been treated with medicine many times, but it is difficult to get rid of the root. I am in unbearable difficulty. I saw in the newspaper that "Gonadoden" can cure old gonorrhea. I am overjoyed to hear that. Can it be effective in getting rid of the root after taking it? I have always admired your journal's clear guidance. So I am writing to inquire again so that I can follow it. (Lu Yongming asks)</p>
<p>(Answer) "Gonadoden" is the only good medicine for treating gonorrhea. It is sold by Shanghai Tongren Western Drug Company. This medicine has extremely strong penetrating and bactericidal power. There are no other side effects. Mild cases can be eradicated with two or three boxes. I heard that the selling price is two yuan per box.</p>
<p>Coin Ringworm</p>
<p>My sister suddenly developed ringworm on her neck, back, armpits, and arms last year. It is the size of silver coins. It is commonly known as coin ringworm. The skin is not only unsightly, but also unbearable when it itches. I bought medicine to apply, but it was not very effective. Please ask if there is any other radical cure medicine and treatment method. (Tan Rongsheng asks)</p>
<p>(Answer) Ringworm is a parasitic skin disease. Most of them are caused by a kind of bacteria that enter the skin. External application of medicine such as "Ganlu" has a special effect. You can buy it to treat it.</p>
<p>Internal Use and External Use</p>
<p>I read in the newspaper that there are medicines that can cure women's red and white leukorrhea. They are "Internal Leukorrhea Pills" and "External Leukorrhea Medicine." But I don't know where these two medicines are sold and what the price is. Please indicate in the newspaper. (Sun Qing asks) (Answer) According to "Internal Leukorrhea Pills" and "External Leukorrhea Medicine," each sells for three yuan. Tongren Western Drug Company in Shanghai sells them.</p>

<h3 id="e227">Selling Books to Seek Education <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Ge</p>
<p>The article titled "Pleading for a Child: Selling Books to Seek Education," published in the local supplement of the Shen Bao on March 9th, goes something like this: A young man studying at a certain middle school is about to graduate this semester. However, due to poverty, and with graduation being a critical juncture, his father, despite piecing together twenty old silver dollars with great difficulty, is still ten dollars short and at a loss. He has no choice but to sell the one hundred and fifty-plus volumes of the "Children's Library" that he has at home, reducing the price from the original eighteen dollars to ten dollars in order to make up for the shortfall in tuition.</p>
<p>The current society is one that emphasizes "qualifications," and "qualifications" are often manifested in a "diploma." If you have a "diploma," you are qualified to make a living in society, regardless of whether this diploma is matched with practical knowledge for earning a living. It seems that a diploma is just a convenient stepping stone for you to get food. Therefore, one type of criminal has increased in society: those who forge "certificates."</p>
<p>However, society is now at its lowest ebb. Even if you have a "diploma," you are not guaranteed a job, or even if you have the golden sign of a doctoral degree, this depressed society will "ignore" you! A company recruitment opportunity will attract thousands upon thousands of middle school and university students with diplomas, but in the end, only about ten people are hired.</p>
<p>What is the use of a "diploma"? If we truly want to "plead for a child," we should seek for the child a kind of learning that is closely related to the child's actual self. However, seeking knowledge does not necessarily mean going to school. What modern schools give young people, in terms of making a living, is merely applications that do not conform to the actual practice of making a living. After reading middle school books for six years, once out of school, except for one or two things that can be used slightly, everything else is a waste of time. Ask a middle school graduate to do algebra, and he has long forgotten half of it, or may even have forgotten fractions and four operations application problems! Furthermore, in terms of thinking, as Mr. Wang Jiyuan said: "The education that schools give to young people is mostly perfunctory, propaganda, deception, and empty and impractical knowledge."</p>
<p>We should "plead for the child" to acquire practical knowledge!</p>

<p>— Xiao Wen</p>
<p>"O! Morning!" Little Tang, with his shiny hair, jumped out, holding a Western-style book. The lights were also on, and several people were looking at the evening newspaper around the table. They squeezed their eyes at that familiar phrase, and some even nodded.</p>
<p>Little Tang also picked up a copy of the Shanghai Times, widening his eyes to read, regardless of whether he understood it. The evening newspaper was in Little Guangdong's hand, and he hated that he couldn't snatch it, but was too embarrassed.</p>
<p>Was it time? A large group of people also came and wandered around.</p>
<p>Ding! Ding! Ding!</p>
<p>"Class is starting! Class is starting!" Someone shouted from the crowd: Little</p>
<p>Little Tang dropped the newspaper, strode upstairs, opened the door of the third classroom. Half the room was full of heads, and he found his old seat and sat down firmly.</p>
<p>The sound of leather shoes brought up a large group of people, dragging their seats to find their own places. In the noise, the teacher in a coat stepped onto the podium. Everyone lifted their buttocks slightly, bent over once, and nodded a few times.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>"Jin zhao shi..." (Today is...) The teacher had a heavy Suzhou accent.</p>
<p>"Today is Grammar!" The throat of number seven in the second row.</p>
<p>Oh dear, I didn't bring the book.</p>
<p>Number four in the first row lent a book to the teacher, and the seat of number five was squeezed tightly together.</p>
<p>Little Guangdong sat casually in the last row.</p>
<p>Little Tang kept reaching into his pocket to chew peanuts.</p>
<p>"Page Three The Past Progressive Form and the Past Perlect..." English with a Suzhou accent.</p>
<p>The classroom was quiet. Seriously.</p>
<p>Number seven in the second row wore a student cap. The muscles on his face were strong, his mouth was wide open, and he yawned, swallowing the sound of the yawn into his belly.</p>
<p>Yawns are contagious. Number seven in the third row also let out a slight one, and Little Tang also yawned. It turned out he had finished his peanuts long ago. The words on the book were blurry, and he couldn't open his eyes. He only heard some disjointed sentences: Little Tang felt a bit sleepy and dared not doze off.</p>
<p>Two children in the fifth row were focused on reading the book, but there was only one book. They turned the pages slowly. Quick-eyed Ah Zhang turned back and waved, it was a book full of vertical lines. Ah Zhang didn't care and regretted that he hadn't brought "Little Five Heroes' Biography" with him. Another yawn.</p>
<p>The teacher read a long sentence with a laugh, changing the pronunciation of the words from time to time, revealing his bulging veins, not caring about the chatter of a few top students. "Complete the following sentences..."</p>
<p>Ding! Ding! Ding!</p>
<p>The noise of books closing rapidly, Little Tang also woke up, wiping the drool from the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>"For the following sentences, you can hand in the papers tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Okay! Okay!"</p>
<p>"All twelve sentences must be done!"</p>
<p>The sound of leather shoes echoed down the stairs. The teacher put on his woolen hat listlessly and walked out of the classroom. Little Tang squeezed out from the crisscrossing seats, stretched out his hand and yawned again, shouting loudly.</p>
<p>"Little Tang! How is it? More tiring than dancing!" Little Guangdong walked down the stairs with him, and everyone laughed.</p>
<p>"There's a tea dance at Saint Anna's today, with cake. It costs two dimes. Let's sit for a while and go!"</p>
<p>"Ah!" Another yawn. "It's good to go once," Little Tang's spirits lifted.</p>
<p>The two heroes went downstairs and stuffed the Western books into their bags.</p>
<p>In the lounge, everyone was reading the newspaper.</p>
<p>Number seven in the second row held the evening newspaper and pulled Ah Zhang's hand:</p>
<p>"Rong Guang is not bad, Lido is also good."</p>
<p>Ding! Ding! Ding!</p>
<p>The second lesson of the night classroom began.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Father and Son <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Kang</p>
<p>When the snow had just stopped, a violent storm began to roar across the Trubkula Plain. The vast, boundless wilderness was covered in pure white snow, and the distant mountains and horizons were like a blanket of velvet. The sun struggled in the frozen clouds, sometimes flashing its face at the snowy ground below, and quickly withdrawing that pale light. The cold arrogantly showed its might, sealing off the entire plain. The snowflakes gradually solidified, and the wind created snow ridges on the plain by picking up snow particles. The snowfield slowly changed, rising in some places and falling in others, making the wilderness look like a vast sea of white waves.</p>
<p>Father Sambatu Chahan put on his rarely worn, greasy, large purple robe. Even in the gloomy weather, the oil on the robe still shimmered. He was full of joy, as if he was the happiest person in the world! Of course! His son, who had been so ill, had suddenly recovered. Anyone would be happy. The fact that his son could get better was entirely due to the divine power of the Living Buddha Norshe Khan Yan. He had made a vow to the Living Buddha, so as soon as his only son, Tobito, was well, he busied himself taking him to the Zaltu Zabu Plain to present gifts to the Living Buddha.</p>
<p>Although Tobito had recovered from his illness, his emaciated body from his long illness had not recovered. However, Father Sambatu Chahan paid no attention to this. He was almost driven crazy by joy. He had lived a most honest and pious life, never engaging in the slightest bit of dishonesty. Since he had made a vow to the Living Buddha, he had to fulfill it as soon as he recovered.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, Sambatu Chahan had carefully counted his livestock. He picked out the fattest and strongest livestock: twenty sheep, two horses, four camels, five cows, herded them together, and before it was even dawn, he took Tobito and drove the livestock away from the Trubkula Plain towards Zaltu Zabu.</p>
<p>Under the attack of the bitter cold, the livestock became unusually docile. Sambatu Chahan rode on horseback, holding Tobito in his arms, and the livestock obediently followed behind. More and more hoof prints were left on the snow, and the wind and waves tumbled upside down. The sheep bleated mournfully, and the horses shook the snow from their manes from time to time. Sambatu Chahan's snot dripped onto the front of his purple robe, and he only cared about looking forward, paying no attention to anything else.</p>
<p>Tobito's teeth were chattering from the cold:</p>
<p>— Dad... Dad... Cold...</p>
<p>— We'll be there soon. Sambatu Chahan pointed to Mount Lutisgan.</p>
<p>As he and the livestock rounded the foot of Mount Lutisgan, a group of young men riding horses with guns on their shoulders rushed towards them, looking like hunters. When they met, the young man leading the group reined in his horse and said respectfully to Sambatu Chahan:</p>
<p>— Old man! Where are you going?</p>
<p>— I am going to Zaltu Zabu to present gifts to the Living Buddha.</p>
<p>The young man smiled, very gently, without any of the rudeness of the Khalkha people. He said comfortingly</p>
<p>— Old man! Bandits killed our defense soldiers at Kanchi Khehamu yesterday. The lamas of the Scientific Ikchao of Zaltu Zabu are inside informants!</p>
<p>Sambatu Chahan was numb and didn't know what to do. He had long heard many rumors about the Living Buddha Norshe Khan Yan, and now it had become a reality! He lowered his head to look at his child, oh dear! Tobito was dead! His whole body was stiff!</p>
<p>— Don't worry, let's go together and drive the ×× bandits out!</p>
<p>Sambatu Chahan clenched his fist and let out a roar from his withered throat:</p>
<p>— Go and fight the ×× bandits!</p>
<h3 id="e230">Elder Sister <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Zhe Ren</p>
<p>Little Xi said to her little friends: My sister is getting married. Little Xi didn't understand what getting married meant, but since no one else's sister was getting married, it seemed that her sister was a bit different.</p>
<p>Her sister liked Little Xi, and Little Xi also liked her sister. When talking about people she liked with her little friends, Little Xi often left out her parents and talked about her sister. When talking about each other's sisters, Little Xi stubbornly said that her sister was the best; but Little Xi couldn't say why her sister was the best. The little friends were unwilling to admit defeat. Why wasn't their sister as good as Little Xi's sister? They were having fun playing, but they always quarreled over their sisters and broke up unhappily. Little Xi didn't win in the end, so she cried and went home to tell her sister. Her sister wiped away her tears, held her on her lap, and told a funny story. When Little Xi stopped crying and smiled, she advised her not to argue with her little friends. All sisters are good. But Little Xi was always unconvinced, and in a few days, the same thing happened again.</p>
<p>On the day her sister got married, Little Xi was extremely proud. Her house was wide open, and the hall was hung with lanterns and decorations. She wore a newly made robe. She stood outside the gate early in the morning, and when she saw a little friend, she boasted that her sister was getting married. Little Xi thought this was the best reason for her sister. She had finally found the answer today. The little friends were also wearing red and green clothes, and they were well-behaved, looking like they had come specifically to eat wedding candy. They were just smiling, not pouting their little lips and bickering as they usually did when talking about sisters. The little friends knew that they should be polite when they were guests. They could give many reasons to refute Little Xi, what was so special about her sister getting married? But they didn't answer Little Xi and crowded around to see the bride. This naturally made Little Xi even happier. Her sister was ultimately the best.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, a military band in uniform marched from outside the gate straight into the hall, with drums, trumpets, so many fun things. Little Xi and her little friends often imitated the military march in the open space, pounding their chests with their little fists as if they were playing drums, and stretching out their arms, pressing down on the air with their ten little fingers as if they were playing trumpets. At the same time, everyone imitated the sounds of various instruments, as long as they had heard them. Now that Little Xi saw so many instruments, she waved her hand, as if holding a conductor's baton, wanting to greet her little friends to practice the military march in real life. But the little friends were not as playful as usual. When the band was playing in the hall, they immediately occupied a seat. What kind of trick was this again, to watch the new official.</p>
<p>After doing so many novel tricks, Little Xi was simply stunned. Those little friends also looked enchanted. Everyone stood and sat politely. Finally, Little Xi's sister came out, and Little Xi looked proudly at her little friends, wanting to show that her sister was the best. But those little friends were just cheering and looking at the bride. Little Xi watched as a sedan chair hanging with tassels carried her sister away. She became anxious and wanted to chase after her, but the hall was crowded with people. She could only grab her mother's sleeve and ask, "Where is sister going?" Her mother saw that her eyes were red, as if she was about to cry, so she quickly hugged her and took her to the back room, wiped her tears like her sister, sat her on her lap, and kissed her face, saying... "Sister is getting married and going to her husband's house. Girls have to get married, and you will be carried away in a fancy sedan chair in the future."</p>
<p>Little Xi just opened her eyes wide. Getting married was originally this kind of thing. Then, she asked her mother, when would her sister come back?</p>
<p>In a few days, her sister came back, and the new official also accompanied her. Little Xi became angry when she saw the strange man. He had taken her sister away. In the evening, her brother-in-law left, but her sister stayed at home. Little Xi was so happy that she twisted her sister around, wanting her to tell stories. But when she saw that her sister's eyes were red from crying, she slowly retreated into her mother's arms, watching suspiciously. She felt that there were too many things she didn't understand. Why did her sister cry when she came back home?</p>
<p>Her mother kissed her face again and said, "Your brother-in-law is not good and bullied your sister." Little Xi stretched out her little fist and answered her mother, I will beat the brother-in-law, and don't let him come again in the future, and my sister shouldn't go to his house again. But her mother shook her head, and Little Xi felt very disappointed. Although she had such a best sister, there were really too many things she didn't understand.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Lantern Festival <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>As usual, after the thirteenth day of the lunar new year in the village, there would be a lively scene again; the east village would have horse lanterns, and the west village would have dragon dances. Those farmers who had worked hard for a year would take these few days to revel as much as possible, to relieve the breath that had been oppressed by life for so long. Even the women and children would run around day and night.</p>
<p>San He heard in the teahouse in town today that Shi Ren Tou was going to have horse lanterns again this year, and he was as happy as a child, jumping to tell his wife the news he brought back from the teahouse:</p>
<p>"Shi Ren Tou's horse lanterns are going to be held for sure. I heard that the date has been chosen, it's the sixteenth of the lunar month, the day after tomorrow, the sixteenth of the lunar month is the day after tomorrow."</p>
<p>"What's the excitement about other people's dragon lanterns and horse lanterns!" San He's wife glanced at him and replied coldly, still mending her shoe soles.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, his joy only got him a cold blast from his wife, and he felt disappointed; but thinking about his own excitement at the time, it was really too silly and ridiculous, no wonder he would run into her nail.</p>
<p>He sat sullenly on a low stool and finished that Chimei brand cigarette in one breath, then lit another one. He thought: The horse lanterns here used to start every year from the thirteenth or fourteenth of the lunar month and would last until the end of the month, but since the countryside suffered from floods, droughts, wars, bandit disasters, and the heavy oppression of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, the villagers often found it difficult to even make a living, so where would they get the interest to start any lantern festivals? The horse lanterns in Shi Ren Tou, which used to be very famous, had not been out for three or four years; and he himself had played in those horse lanterns. This year, it was rare that someone was reviving these horse lanterns that had been suspended for three or four years, so naturally I should play some role, fortune-telling, palm reading, offering vegetarian meals, anything will do, in short, just need to act alike, say it loosely. ...

<p>Opening "Spring Outing Song"</p>
<p>Soft willow catkins rise pale yellow. Peach blossoms compete with new makeup. The spring scenery bothers people, they can't sleep. A branch of red apricot extends beyond the east wall. Decorating the spring scenery with warmth. Red fat and green thin compete in strange fragrance. Every leaf and flower is picturesque. Orioles sing, swallows laugh, butterflies and bees flit. Even more joyous, grass and trees meet spring and are healthy. The wind awakens the yellow beam every morning. A view of half the plain is beautiful. The branches of beautiful flowers often accompany Lagerstroemia indica. Friends go on spring outings. The welcoming grass brushes the transverse embankment. Still more joyous, the willows want to sprout and the peaches want to bloom. There is a deep feeling that requires comparison. One must know that the best scenery is originally in spring. Natural paintings are in the riverside village. Wait until the third month of the spring scenery is deepest. A thousand reds and ten thousand purples are even more fragrant. However, the same beauty has several kinds of views. Let me distinguish the details. Some are young women thinking of spring, their hearts are confused. The sleepy weather is even more茫茫. Occasionally seeing green willows on the street. They say, I hope my husband will be ennobled. Some are young ladies and famous women in their boudoirs. In the deep boudoir, they quietly embroider mandarin ducks. Suddenly feeling that the bothersome spring scenery has arrived. They are tired of books and have a long afternoon dream. Some are couples with deep affection, looking at the beautiful scenery with affection. They go on spring outings in the suburbs. They speak of their deep love and affection. Some are men of letters and poets who accompany each other. In the apricot blossom village, they share wine. Some are widows whose thoughts of their husbands are painful. They lazily look at the spring scenery and lie in their beds. Although one kind of sorrow cannot be forgotten. How can they face the disturbing spring dream? Therefore, the spring scenery is originally the same. Some people are happy and laughing, some are sad. Talking about it is harmless.</p>

<p>— (Blow)</p>
<p>For the past eighteen years, no German soldiers have been seen along the Rhine. The other day, German troops marched into the city of Frankfurt. Tens of millions of people cheered in unison, and some were so happy that they wept. The residents of Bonn even broke through the barriers of the advancing troops and hung garlands around the soldiers' necks. Tan Lao San said that this is like country people not recognizing the revolving lantern, saying, "Here it comes again," "Here it comes again." Zhu commented that the first "Here it comes again" is when the German troops marched into the Rhine, and the second "Here it comes again" is probably the beginning of the second great war.</p>
<p>The German troops suddenly marched into the Rhine, and France is using all its strength to resist Germany. Diplomacy and military affairs are being pursued simultaneously, and the situation is very tense. Tan Lao San said, "Pursuing simultaneously will scare the old lady to death. The situation is tense, a big war is about to break out. If a character-splitting fortune teller sees it, it must be more bad luck than good."</p>

<h3 id="e239">"Tian Lun" Goes to America <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>Since its release, "Tian Lun" has been publicly performed in various places, and both its critical acclaim and box office success have been outstanding. It has been called "the pinnacle of the national-made silent film era," a statement that most people who have seen the film do not deny.</p>
<p>But the film has not only received praise from the Chinese people, but also international attention, which is also noteworthy. In Europe, the film will be screened in theaters in various places. Recently, Paramount Pictures in the United States has telegraphed Lianhua, requesting the rights to release and distribute the film in the United States, and the terms have already been agreed upon.</p>
<p>In the narrow Chinese film market, it is a gratifying thing that "Tian Lun" can be promoted to Europe and America!</p>
<h3 id="e240">How Many Jokes in "Guo Se Tian Xiang"? <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Film Company's great sound film "Guo Se Tian Xiang" will soon be publicly screened at the Carlton, starring Dan Erchun, Bai Hong, and Bai Yan. It features wanderers in a bustling city, a righteous singing girl, a police officer who arrests the wrong thief, a manager full of embarrassing behavior, a beautiful female clerk in a shoe store, a singing salesman from a confectionery company, a musician upstairs in a tailor shop, and a young man who falls asleep as soon as he hears about national affairs. The performances are extremely interesting, and the positive intentions are hidden in the jokes, showing the painstaking efforts of the writers and directors.</p>
