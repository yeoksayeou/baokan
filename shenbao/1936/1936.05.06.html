<h3>蔣委員長昨抵京　出巡廿八日經六省　視察川滇黔之感想</h3>
<p>地方行政大體上已有相當推動　普遍缺點在不取實際工作散漫</p>
<p>（南京）蔣委員長由九江乘永綏艦、五日晨八時半到蕪湖、換乘汽車、十時半抵京、將主持十日行政院召開之十省廳長專員會議、（五日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）出巡各省軍政行將匝月之蔣委員長、四日下午五時、偕侍從室第一處主任錢大鈞、第二處主任陳布雷、及秘書侍衛等、由潯乘永綏軍艦東下、五日晨八時、四十五分抵蕪湖、換乘汽車、於十一時安抵首都、蔣委員長於四月八日由京乘逸仙艦西上、十日下午四時抵漢、十二日下午四時由漢乘機飛宜昌、十三日晨乘民生輪西上、沿途在巫山夔府萬縣各名勝登岸遊覽、十六日下午三時四十分抵渝、翌日下午三時飛蓉、除垂詢川軍政情形、召見將領紳耆地方領袖談話外、十八日主持軍校成都分校開學禮、二十二日晨九時半飛昆明、二十五日晨十時飛滇、二十七日下午四時飛湘、二十九日晨十一時飛贛、勾留迄今、總計此行共二十八日、歷經鄂川滇黔湘贛六省、除巡視各省軍政外、幷多所指示、誠可謂席不暇暖、艱苦辛勤、聞蔣委員長抵京後暫不他往、十日行政院召開十省廳長專員會議、將親臨主持一切、（五日中央社電）</p>
<p>（南昌）蔣委員會偕陳布雷錢大鈞及隨從人員、於四日午後五時、過潯東下、熊式輝四日午後四時返省（五日中央社電）</p>
<p>（蕪湖）蔣委長五日晨八時半乘、永綏艦由潯到蕪、逸仙艦隨護、蔣卽登岸改乘軍委會來迎汽車遊覽蕪市一週、九時循京蕪路返京、（五日專電）</p>
<p>（蕪湖）蔣委員長五日晨八時半、由潯乘永綏艦抵蕪、旋由海關碼頭登岸、接見公安局長徐會之等、垂詢蕪市建設與皖南治安、九時乘軍委會來迎汽車、視察市區一週、卽循京蕪公路返京、（五日中央社電）</p>
<p>（南京）蔣委員長五日回京、發表巡視川滇黔三省之感想如下、</p>
<p>禁烟努力成績最佳</p>
<p>此次出發主要在視察川滇黔三省、以余離川已半年以上、不到滇黔兩省、將及一年、頗欲明瞭三省之實際設施情形、故在該三省停留較久、視察所得、覺三省政治上最有顯著之進步者、厥爲禁烟、無論禁種禁吸、均能迅速實在、不但按照預定程限做到、且超過原定程序以上、人民多能自動戒吸、滇省調騐公務員允爲認眞、三省主席對禁種亦甚努力、因改種穀物之結果、食糧生產、較前顯有增加、此决赤匪窮竄滇境、人民絕鮮逃亡、卽由蓋藏充實之故、最顯著之印象、卽所見人民已無去年以前憔悴愁苦之容、此最可欣慰者、</p>
<p>交通建設進步亦速</p>
<p>其决爲交通建設、進步亦速、公路之已完成通車者、有川陝路、（成都至西安長一千一百七十四公里、）川黔路、（重慶至貴陽段五百五十一公里、）湘黔路、（一千零十六公里、）川黔路整理最完善、湘黔路通過多山之區施工最難、但亦依照行營預定程限、依期完成、黔滇路（貴陽至昆明、六百廿二公里、）進行亦速、本月內卽可完成、此連貫五省之四大公路、合計三千三百餘里、均係最近一年間所與築、黔滇路通車以後、由南京乘車可直達見明、交通上必有甚大之進步、此皆各該省政府人民切實努力之所致、以上二點、最足令人滿意、</p>
<p>縣長人選亟應甄別</p>
<p>至川滇黔之一般政治、大體上亦均有相當進展、惟尙待改進之處、亦復不少、縣長人選、亟應注意甄選、現任縣長中、尙有老弱庸劣者、必須更換、以敎養衛三端而論、敎育方面、數量已較前增加、惟辦理情形、尙不能達到預期之希望、衛的方面、社會秩序已較前安定、而保甲團隊及民衆訓練等、尙未能見實在成續、且不能根據以民治民之原則、發展自治自衛之力量、最缺乏者爲養的方面、各縣對於開闢地利造林濬河、以及增加生產、發展國民經濟均少着手、甚或尙未注意、此固由地方經濟枯竭資金缺乏、有事實上之困難、但地方官吏如能實心實力、注意此事、亦非全無辦法、</p>
<p>勞動服務須求普及</p>
<p>勞動服務、間亦有切實辦理之縣分、著有相當成續、但係極少數、尙須力求普及、至義務徵工方面、雖有相當成續然其中有一最普遍之缺點、卽所徵盡係貧苦人民、而較有資產地位、如各地之敎職員學生、及地方士紳、均不能以身作則、切實參加、此種不平等之現象、殊非余倡導義務徵工之本意、各省應力矯此弊、切實改善、允望知識份子、及地方上有資產有地位者、積極參加、爲本地方造福、</p>
<p>衛生設施極為缺乏</p>
<p>其次川滇黔三省衛生設施、極爲缺乏、滇黔兩省有若干縣份竟有兩縣無一家藥舖者、余意必須消極的使人民有療治疾病之所、而後積極的方能增進人民之健康與體格、此與敎養衛三者養的方面、最有關係、甚望各地極力改正、</p>
<p>管理統制更須注意</p>
<p>至就一般地方行政而論、各地大體上均已有相當之推動、惟其最普遍之缺點、一爲不切實際、換言之、雖努力而不能實在、一爲各項工作散漫、而不相聯繫、致不能收到整個之功效、此由不知努力之方法、故余意敎養衛三者之外、必須更注意於管理、無論敎養衛三者、均不能忽略管理與統制、所謂管理卽必須注意者、查注意督促、綜覈名實、信賞必罰、允須注重在秩序與紀律、所謂統制、卽統盤籌劃、分別緩急决序、注意各項工作之密切連繫、勿令散漫無紀、各自爲政、使努力等於虛擲、此則各地主持政治人員、允以專員縣長等、所必須注意者也、（五日中央社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>德偽協定的透視</h3>
<p>— 賓</p>
<p>德國克樸博士（Dr.Oito　C.Kiep）領導下的遠東經濟考察團自去冬抵日後就跟日本朝野商議互相促進德日「滿」商業提携的辦法其後該團曾往東三省視察旋又東渡日本更與日當局商購東三省大豆迭經折衝最近電訊傳來該團已於四月三十日代表德國在東京與僞國簽訂貿易恊定了協定的內容規定「『滿洲國』輸往德國的貨物如大豆羊毛等其貨價百分之七十玉當由德國以外幣償付其餘百分之二十五則以馬克找付之至德國輸往『滿洲國』貨物的數量須以其輸入額爲限不得溢出」</p>
<p>最近以來德國內部經濟的矛盾日甚食物恐慌達於極點這幾天報上盛載戈林和沙赫特互相傾軋的消息正是一個明證因此這决恊定的簽結在德國多少是有着平衡貿易緩和內部經濟矛盾的意義然而在另一方面我們却不能完全相信它們半官報「本恊定的性質僅爲技術上的」的說數在德日軍事同盟盛傳的今日德僞恊定的締結我們誠不能忽略它所含有的嚴重的政治意義</p>
<p>這决恊定的簽訂我們不能不懷疑完全是某國人主動的野心國家爲耍增進它在東亞擴展的效能想拉攏德國做帮手因此情願在東三省讓德國來沾些利便反正東三省多的是大豆以此換取克虜伯廠的大砲飛機不正是計之得麽？</p>
<p>至於德國它因內部經濟矛盾的日益加深正迫切地需要着向外發展在中歐一帶旣因小協的等諸國的封鎖而碰壁得能在原料豐饒的遠東揷入一足自然正是他之所望况且德日矛盾比較的緩和雖然因太平洋委任統治地的關係德日間也不免有些衝突但德國爲了拉攏日本早表示願意揩去這些痕跡了上决希特勒演說要求恢復殖民地時獨不首提起日本的委任統治地縱不是表示願意放棄至少也當是有意討好日本</p>
<p>總上所述我們可知這决在德日協調之下締結的德僞協定實不啻是德日間一條有力的連鎖德日本是站在一條陣綫上的東西兩大先鋒因這條連鎖的聯結似將更顯得密切了德日軍事同盟謠傳已久德偽協定的締結更瞪明了這種謠傳不是「空穴來風」了</p>

<h3>冀察防共問題　談商告一段落</h3>
<p>冀東交涉尙無具體辦法　察北事件前途仍多困難</p>
<p>天津通信、冀察外交、自日武官在津會議閉幕後、雙方續行談判、現已屆重要關頭、冀察當局正傾注全力、打破當前難題、所有在津商定事件、其已吿段落者爲防共問題、正在邁進者爲冀束偽組織之撤銷、未來準備談判者、爲察北事件、茲分述各情如後、</p>
<p>防共問題</p>
<p>所謂冀察防共、爲日方第一件要求、所謂防共協定、爲本件先决問題、雙方爭議多决、文字雖已作成、當局則以冀束僞組織、須卽取消、方能簽字、日方則主須有事實表現、始允續談其他問題、爭論至再、最後决定先就協定內容作去、簽字手續、改於宋哲元歸平後補辦、</p>
<p>冀東交涉</p>
<p>比來中日談判、確已進展、此蓋因防共具體辦法、半已實現、日方不便再行搪脫、東京方面、對於冀東僞組織取消、在永見歸國請示時、卽已同意、不過華北一般日本武官、覺殷汝耕賣力如彼、親善如此、遽令取消、旣無以獎掖未來、目足致親善者寒心、失一殷汝耕事小、杜絕後進者事大、並因殷汝耕日來肆力活動、掙扎圖存、得日關東軍部方面支持、驟然取消、亦有相當困難、因此之故、日方對於此事、遂分三派、甲派主張維持冀東僞組織存在、免貽無</p>
<p>義口實、並使殷汝耕輩寒心、乙派主張須卽取消、與冀察政務會合流、而監視其成績、丙派不加可吾、主張注視時局推演程度、再作决定、當局有見及此、乃努力消失甲丙兩派之意見、化除進展障礙、以期事功收獲較速、目前談判、蓋卽在此重要階段、聞日方已微示可取消冀東僞組織、然必須冀察政會與冀東僞組織「合流」、冀察政會、爲容納冀東僞組織、根本須得改組、首腦部必浪更動、殷汝耕通緝令旣須取消、未來位置、亦不得低於現在、偽組織內幹部人員、亦得盡數安插、彼此不談誰為「取消」字樣、當局以為「合流「一語、等於合併、旣稱合併、是僞組織組胞機能悉未喪生、如此辦理、是殆容認偽組織爲正當、而自行分割一席、揖讓股汝耕率其黨羽據坐也、故對此甚不同意、主張撤消殷之通緝令、尙有可爲、未來出路、亦好商量、但必須退出戰區、不能改頭換面、依然佔據其冀柬、此爲堅持不易原則、現在研究者、亦以此點作中心、惟般汝耕仍欲繼績其僞組織壽命、活動不歇、當局進展一寸、渠亦前進一寸、互相抵消、交涉進行、遂致濡　、華北日駐軍司令官多田、奉調歸國、繼任者爲中國通之田代、如此問題解决於多田離華前、結果或較和善、吾則田代到任、政見或影響於外交、屆時不知將伊於胡底矣、</p>
<p>察北事件</p>
<p>在事實上、當局對於察北本件、已無與日方談商之力、蓋防共與冀東兩項、常局苦心焦慮、應付尙虞不週、若並察北事件交涉、互相牽掣、求遠　不達矣、當局自認稍自慰者、在外交折衝、事權統一、於不喪權·不辱國。及不背中央外交意旨作去、祗要對方負責有人、談判卽可循序而進、前此土肥原來華、以日關東軍瀋陽特務機關長名義辦理華北外交、越俎代庖、招致駐津日軍部之忌、當局處於雙重外交勢力之下、窮於應付、近松室以華北駐軍部附、常川駐平、負外交折衝之責、比較接洽方便、察北事件、雖屬於日關東軍範圍之內、倘松室肯力爲紹介、覔一相手方、交涉容或順利、祇察北情形較冀東複雜、日方因懼共匪自綏察邊境竄入僞滿境內、已播弄德王獨立、李守信僞軍、改爲德王統轄、德王徙蒙政會於察北化德、僞組織卽將實現、果成事實、與未來交涉、殊多困難、宋哲元個人與德王友好無間、深悉德王爲此、多綠與晉綏當局不睦、負氣之下、不擇途徑、日前已飭察省府主席張自忠、就近派員前往勸阻、惟聞德王已如弦上之箭、乘機待發、又恐非口舌之力、所能止其企圖者矣、（三日）</p>
<h3>日人包庇下　華北走私真相</h3>
<p>私貨在海岸公開卸運　形成自由貿易的情態　在國際道德上實不合</p>
<p>外論社譯字林西報天津通訊、記者此决赴津、對於冀東私運問題、曾加以詳細之觀察、茲將所得結果、臚列於後、於此可見此項問題之嚴重矣、</p>
<p>記者曾與新自北戴河返津之某商入談及私運事、據云、「余並未見有私運情事、所見者、只有各式船隻三十八艘、停泊於北戴河海灣、用舢板多隻、卸運貨物至海濱起岸、其忙碌之情狀、正不减於貨運繁多時之天津外灘各碼頭、君不能再稱此爲私運、因其實爲自由貿易矣、就目下之情形而觀、北戴河不僅爲自由貿易之口岸、甚至其沿海一帶、亦均自由開放也、」云云、</p>
<p>此外更有一事、亦頗堪注意、記者曾詢一經營私運之俄人、叩所運入私貨之數量、是吾有任何限制、此入答曰、「並無限制、凡君所需要之貨物、皆可隨時運入、除非笨重如象者、始略有困難也、」云云、換言之、冀東一帶、已造成一種完全新的經濟局面、不久卽將成爲自由貿易之區域、一切免稅之貨物、皆將開始侵入華北各地、唯一的限制、只爲運輸費用之多寡而已、</p>
<p>今在討論正當貿易所受之影響以前、擬先略述私運何以能如此猖獗之原因、故冀東一帶私運之開端、係有大批日韓浪人非法私運銀元、此事原爲日關東軍之一種「壓迫政策」、用以擾亂中國之貨幣、因私運銀元之獲利、遂推想及於其他各種貨物、於是乃有大批白糖及人造絲、由大連運至熱河、再裝載運貨汽車、由武裝之韓人保護、强迫駛入長城各口、因其地適在戰區之內、所有海關人員、皆不許携帶武器、故對之殊乏抵抗之能力、</p>
<p>私運者之膽量、日益放大、認爲直接由大連經海道輸運、比較更可獲利、自去歲十月以來、卽開始有各種船隻、出現於楡關北戴河一帶之海岸、若遇海關巡艦干涉、日本關東軍卽提出抗議、謂係違反塘沽協定、結果、海軍巡艦只得撤退、再如私運貨物上岸之時、如有關員上前徵稅、往往遭遇韓人之痛毆、此種情事、已數見不鮮、</p>
<p>中國海關方面對此、雖屢提抗議、日人均置不理、反之、如有韓人私販、略受微傷、日方立卽要求巨額賠償、毫不讓步、後因餒冬結冰、私運情事、略見减少、但至今春開航之後、私運之多、反較前加甚焉、中國海關於萬不得已之中、乃思得一策、遂以三月二十一日與北寗路局接洽、對於一切貨運、如無海關所供給之運單、請勿予以運輸、此舉雖不能完全肅淸私運、但確有大效、惜不幸實行三日之後、鐵路常局、卽不堪日軍之壓迫、而將該約破壊、路局方面、更拒絕海關在車站查騐貨物、所持理由、係以海關方面之設備、較爲完備、可以容納大量之貨物、如發見私貨、卽可沒收入庫云云、殊不知所有私貨、早已堆入其特租之貨棧、此類貨棧、大半皆在日本租界之內、</p>
<p>中國海關所受之最後打擊、卽爲冀東僞組織之自立稅關、對於私貨所徵之稅賦、只及正當關稅四分之一、並聲明此後不得再行重徵、更不受中國政府稅吏之干涉、海關方面、自與鐵路所訂協定破壊之後、其最後陣錢、又遭崩潰、最近兩個月以來、自楡關至北戴河一帶之海岸、私貨之輸入、爲數實可驚人、私運之主要中心地點、爲北戴河·秦皇島·南大石·及留守營附近之海濱、此外如秦皇島·北戴河·昌黎·留守營·及灤州各車站、亦爲各私販活動之塲所、</p>
<p>或謂冀東私運如此猖獗、華北之正當貿易、勢必大受其影響、此語實不足以形容眞狀於萬一、質言之、華北有數種重要貿易、已完全爲其所毀滅矣、私運貨物、本以白糖·人造絲·毛織品·捲烟紙·爲大宗、近數星期來、私貨種類、又見增加、如煤油·汽油·橡皮鞋·綿織布疋·蘋果等、已大批免稅輸入各市塲云、</p>
<p>茲將本年四個月中輸入之私貨、列表於後、</p>
<p>白糖　三八〇·〇〇〇包（每包九十公斤）</p>
<p>人造絲　五〇·〇〇〇包（每包四五公斤）</p>
<p>捲烟紙　五〇〇·〇〇〇捆</p>
<p>布疋　一五·〇〇〇包</p>
<p>雜貨　一〇·〇〇〇箱</p>
<p>正當之糖業、自去歲十月以來、幾已完全停滯、各商家皆無分文之交易、此種情形、原無足異、蓋目下天津市面上之糖價、每包僅十三元、此數僅及正當市價之半數、白糖輸入之稅額、當需每包十四元之多、目下海關方面卽使將糖稅减低百分之五十、亦無濟於事也、現在津市白糖堆積甚多、卽私糖亦暫難再入吸收矣、</p>
<p>油業自上月開始、亦感到私貨之影響、四月中、由大連運至冀東之煤油二萬箱、汽油一千箱、其中的百分之八五爲日本煉油廠之出品、此種私油之售價、每十介倫的較各種正當油價、减少二元、油業前途之危險、誠難預料也、</p>
<p>上述各種私運之如此猖獗、係由於日本之包庇、可母庸諱言、但日人方面之爭辯、則謂私運之盛行、乃由關稅過高所造成、且目下投資於私運者、華人之金錢、實多於日人、故今日之私運、實華人自爲之云云、日人此種强辯之辭、姑不必置論、况日本領事當局曾公開宣言、謂私運入華在日本法律之下、並不違法、換言之、此種私運之經營、實已獲得日當局之縱容及直接之許可也、</p>
<p>日本容許其國民在友邦之領土上、從事於私運事業、此種態度、在國際道德上、實屬不合、不過吾人須知此種私運、乃日本軍事當局所欲利用之以獲得某種政治上之目的、關稅之减低、尙屬其决要者也</p>

<h3>胡積安被父妾李氏　訴追贍養續審</h3>
<p>李氏續狀法院補具理由　被吿辯稱無力付給鉅欵</p>
<p>－庭諭兩造親自投質－</p>
<p>北京路胡慶餘堂藥店及南市阜昌參行股東胡淦卿、自於民國十八年病故後、其妾李氏、近延章七釗·彭淵恂·兩律師具狀、向特一院民庭控訴淦卿之子胡積安、要求一次給付贍餋費四萬三千三百二十元、及代償債務一萬元等情、此案業經法院一度傳訊、各情已誌本報、茲悉原告胡李氏於改期後、山其代理章·彭·兩律師</p>
<p>補具理由</p>
<p>續狀法院、更正贍養、其狀略稱、上次庭訊時、被吿代理律師辯稱、原吿素日浪費、且被吿並未繼承鉅額遺產、一味抺煞、令人不甘緘默、查被吿揑稱原吿在室內另裝電話一架、係屬浪費、要知宅中之電話、係裝於被吿室內、凡戚友與原吿接話、每被拒絕、不得已另裝一具、又謂原吿已將三千元之存欵提化盡凈一點、查先夫淦卿只贈予三千元存欵、事在民國十五年冬、迄已十年、在此期間、經過</p>
<p>先夫病故</p>
<p>本身醫藥、親戚應酬、等等、依年計算、每年不過三百元、以素有場面之大家婦女、在上海生活高貴之區、年多用二三百元、有何足奇、何况此中尙有一千元、由被吿親手借去、迄至去年一月、始還六百元、被吿前向伊父索欵未允、屢請原吿緩頰、原告以伊父病重、未便多言、祇得由原吿陸續墊給、嗣伊父一病不起、以致原告所借各欵、均無着洛、被吿亦置之不理、而債權人嚴索、試問存欵</p>
<p>如何保存</p>
<p>被吿謂財產祇有三四萬元、實係不符、因淦卿公故世後、遺有財產、如牯嶺路住宅、約値七萬元、南市草昌參行、現有資本百餘萬元、共十三股、被吿計有五股、德昌參號現有資本的四十萬元、被吿計有五股、保大參號一股、胡慶餘堂二股、以上均爲事實、應請依職權調查、再被吿時將參號之欵撥出、專做</p>
<p>投機事業</p>
<p>虧耗甚多、幷縱慾無度、胡濫納妾、現伊母伊妻伊子、均移住杭州、不堪同居、其他託名營業、允不可勝數、以勢推之、被吿家產雖富、內容一旦暴露、窮無立錐、原吿爲終身生活計、請求將生活費用、一决付給云云、昨日午後、此案由彭時推事蒞民四庭續訊、原吿代理律師陳述以上情形、被吿亦延陸紹宗·奚士昌·兩律師辯稱、查原吿之存欵三千元、確已</p>
<p>陸續提用</p>
<p>目下祗存五十餘兀、有賬簿呈案可稽、今原吿要求一次給付贍養費叫萬餘元、被吿實無力負担、且此種請求、與雙方均無利益、即使被吿將膽養費一次付給、而原吿亦不過舒適一時、迨將來金盡時、仍屬自己吃苦、何况被吿實屬無力給付、至被吿目下祇有一妻一妾、且從未經營投機事業、緣有被吿先父之另一妾、曾以</p>
<p>其母名義</p>
<p>向被吿主張權利、涉訟法院、結果、因該妾另居外面、故判令被吿月給生活費一百元、後被吿上訴經人調解、始勉力籌劃八千元和解、本案原吿乃效允而起、殊不知被吿家中尙有一父妾在、如亦來涉訟、則被吿祗有宣吿破產、因此請求駁回原吿之訴、彭推事論本案改期、着兩造到案再訊、</p>

<h3>三化方案之重要性</h3>
<p>— 齊文禮</p>
<p>立國之要素有三日人民，曰土地，曰主權，而人民又爲一切文化政治活動主體，政治之良窳，文化之高低，胥由精神與物質的生活力量表現出來，生活有病態，政治與文化亦必受其影響。總理有言：「國者人之積，人者心之器，而國事者人羣心理現象也，」是故政治之隆污，係乎人心之振靡。」我國今日外患日益緊迫，而社會病態，呈露於吾人之眼前，以往種種運動發生，每多忽視於全民族之活動，而僅囿於一隅之故，蓋人類　自然產兒，國家與社會又爲人類之集體，人類一切之活動，直接影響於社會與國家，故欲談救國，必先使國民生活有一個標凖的趨向，始能造　風氣，陶鑄世人，此則新生活運動之旨趣，而所以爲救國之運動也。至新生活運動之初步工作，在於國人普遍實行「規矩」「淸潔」二項，然新運之最高目的决不在此，蔣委員長於手訂新運綱要中巳剴切言明：「國民生活如何始得高尙曰生活藝術化，國民生活如何始得富足，日生活生產化，國民生活如何始得鞏固，曰生活軍事化。」蓋藝術化可以砭愚智也，生產化可以濟貧仁也，軍事化可以起弱勇也，是則三化方案與總理之教養衛無不貫通，其重要固可知也，茲分論之：</p>
<p>一·生活軍事化：我國爲文化之邦，素以文事目誇，允以明時制藝，滿淸仍之，囿其思想耗其精神，終年窗下於筆墨之間，明太祖自視計得曰：「天下十子盡在吾　中，一殊不知流毒廣被有如是之甚也。日人常署吾國曰：「支那特文字之國，」夫邦國所以生有於世者武，誠如彼斯麥之言；「世界無所謂公理，無所謂公法，黑鐵耳，赤血耳。」文弱書生，坐談治國則猶未也，况衛國乎？今者强鄰壓境危如纍卯，已不容吾人因循，散漫，怯懦，頽唐，是故全體國民生活軍事化，實屬刻不容緩。「所謂生活軍事化者，非即全國同胞，全數武裝偕赴疆場也，只期其重組織，尙團結，嚴紀律，守秩序，知振奮，保嚴肅，選從前散漫，推諉，因循，苟且之習性而已。」至訓練人民主要辦法，如男女公民訓練，壯丁訓練，區長保甲長之訓練，學生軍事敎育，及防空演習等，且現代之戰爭，非片斷的，單純的，爲立體的，整個的，動員乃國民之動員，戰鬥利器，胥以高度科學文明爲基礎，中國苟不欲自存則已，吾則必當痛矯歷史上之弱點，提倡科學敎育，普及軍事常識。彼斯麥之統一德意志，即成功於國民軍事敎育，可爲吾人借鑑者也。</p>
<p>二·生活生產化：一國財富之增進，第一賴國家與個人之生產力，第二則賴生產者與非生產者人口之比例如何？無生產力固不足以言財富富富，生產者太少，亦不足以言財富，大學有云：「生財有大道，生之者衆，食之者寡，爲之者疾，用之者舒，則財恒足矣。」管子有言：「草田多而辟田少者，雖不水旱飢國之野也。」古時農業時代其經濟之關係於國脈也已如此，况近代金融社會乎？</p>
<p>當茲國難嚴重之時，一人當做兩人事，二人當生兩人之產，無生產能力者，應極力節的，减低浪費，儲蓄物力，以應急需，吾人試觀日本國勢，如是隆盛，國人日常生活，食不過小碟鹹菜·小塊鹹魚·用節餘之資，以完成其每年廿萬萬元之軍備預算。蘇俄國力如是猛晋，亦在節儉消費，食不過黑麵包，衣不過粗呢絨，用節儉之資以完成其先後五年計劃。故今日我國之生產化運動，在積極方面，應發展勞動服務，在消極方面，應推銷國貨，提倡儉約，以應國難，以蘇民生。</p>
<p>三·生活藝術化：何謂藝術？如何方稱爲藝術生活？此則吾人所要作一正確解答，蓋藝術之本質就是美，美之意思，即是能使人發生快感，故「美之快惑」即爲藝術之本質與涵義，所謂生活藝術云者，亦即要吾人日常生活充滿於「美之快感」也，換言之，就是生活上要感覺有趣，然欲達此目的，則首須個人內心具有藝術之素養，且藝術絕與浪漫不同，非如　墨客，畫家，樂師，跣足敞襟，不拘小節，　賞風流之謂，昔陶侃有言：「君子當正其衣冠，尊其瞻視，安有蓬頭跣足，而自命故達者哉。」至一般人以爲藝術生活，乃有閒階級之環境，盡日爲衣食住奔忙者，實無權走進藝術之鬥，更爲誤解，蓋藝術能彌補人生之缺陷，拯救人生之痛苦，宇宙之間，一草一木處處都含藝術意味，昔蘇東坡云：「如江上之淸風，與山間之明月，耳得之而爲聲，目遇之而成色，取之不盡，用之不竭，是天地間造物之無盡藏也。」祇要個人具有藝術之素養，則對社會一切，自能領悟其興趣所在，而一切乾燥，殘酷，欺騙，狡詐，卑劣，苟且之現象，自皆不易發生，故吾人欲於空閒上，時間上，變更苦悶之生活，則生活藝術化是賴焉。</p>
<p>總之新生活運動爲一無止境之運動，以上云者特就事實迫耍者言之，時代前進，需要亦　進，新生活運動之目標，亦隨之而前進，新運實足爲此時此地之時代軌範，與理論之準繩，而欲克盡此時代之使命，則視國人努力如何以爲斷耳。</p>

<h3>雷震講「民族與文化」　（二）</h3>

<p>學校調查</p>
<h3>上海德國學校概況（二）</h3>
<p>— 胡祖蔭</p>
<p>三，校舍與設備</p>
<p>該校校舍很是偉大，建築新穎。校舍是W字形；中有六層大建築一座，兩翼有四層建築各一座。全校佔地的十餘畝，交通亦稱便利。校舍樓下是幼稚園，小學敎室暨校長敎員辦公室。二樓三樓有中學各級各科敎窒及大禮堂。總計普通敎室有十二間；特殊敎室有物理化學實騐室，圖書，美術室，大禮堂，健身房（與大禮堂合用）等。其他及衣帽室，飲水處，男女生厠所，運動塲，舉校園等均屬可用。各敎室均用鋼窗，是以光綫充足。幼稚園另有玻璃房間，三面裝置長玻璃窗：天晴時兒童在其中遊戲，可得充分陽光；天冷時因室中裝有熱水汀管，兒童在其中遊戲亦不致受寒。全校各敎室均接有水汀管，取熱方面亦屬衛生淸潔。該校四五六層樓各房間係為校長敎師住宿之用。另有一部份房間用作德國禮拜堂牧師及德國旅滬僑民公團辦公室。</p>
<p>在設備方面，該校亦稱完備。進學校大門，在兩旁走廊中有兩個巨大的火車和輪船模型，可以啟發兒童的科學思想。各敎室內桌椅多用德國雙人式，不易移動。敎室內亦有相當佈置。物理化學儀器標本頗為豐富。物理室置有德國製Epidia　skop牌中號幻燈一架，値價國幣二百五十元。該幻燈有三種用途：　可放射通通幻燈玻璃片；　可放射各種標本及書中圖表；　另用一種小機頭可接連放射短的影片。該項幻燈係德國新近發明製造，（本埠四川路禮和洋行經售）對於科學與史地敎學頗有重大帮助。</p>

<h3>國貨的生命線</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>華北走私，肆無忌憚，外貨傾銷，源源不斷，國貨之生命，不絕如縷。國將何以生存何以立足？舍自力尋求新路，為碩果僅存之國貨留一線之命脈外，其惟政府之實力帮忙。蓋世界任何國家之國貨工業，無一不以政府為後盾，苟政府而不肯帮國貨工廠之忙，則國貨工業尙有何望？</p>
<p>吾認為政府之事業繁多，機關林立，其每年所用之國貨量，為數實不在少。苟政府購料，均惟國貨是用，為國貨界之大主顧，則國貨工業，至少得一新生路，足以挽救不景氣之局面。</p>
<p>最近政府對於國貨之提倡，似較已往為熱烈，為有實際。如服裝之儘量採用國產；交通與鐵道之購用國貨材料；實業部之一再派員調查國貨工業；力予贊助，我國貨界之愁雲慘霧，稍稍有撥陰霾而窺白日之氣象。顧尙不能已於言也：如吳蘊初氏所經營之天利廠，其出品硝酸，確實優美而採用者尙少，故為吳氏計，應儘量宣傳，多方試騐，以堅用戶之信仰心，則所下苦心，遲早可以為人認識。此外類似吳氏之國貨工廠，均宜猛下工夫，力事改進，俾國家購料，無待外求，一切均可自給，則中國國貨界之生命綫，不但可維持不絕，或有新生路開展之一日也。</p>
<h3>從國貨談到國富</h3>
<p>— 大文</p>
<p>的確，這是一件國貨界値得慶幸的事！</p>
<p>近幾年來，我國人對於服用國貨的心理，已漸漸地趨入更深一步的服用習慣了，而一般素來以服用舶來品為目標的仕女們，也漸漸地被感化而服用國貨了。</p>
<p>這成效是一方面由於國貨廠商努力製造出品，精心硏究物質的優美，價格的平民化，比較任何舶來品，經久耐用，於是銷路方面年年激增，日進一日，使舶來品受到一個重大的打擊，使洋商們獲利上一個重大的損失，這是多麼可慶可賀的事啊！</p>
<p>但另一方面，亦不能不歸功於各商業領袖及各報紙刋物的宣傳，使國人腦海里常印着『服用國貨』的四個字，同時又各處舉行國貨運動和國貨展覽會等國貨提倡工作，極力宣傳，這些都是事關國貨前途上很密切的主要工作。</p>
<p>照例，服用國貨一件事，是不需要宣傳的，我們理應該人人服用國貨，盡國民的天職，不論在衣食住行各方面所需要的用品，皆宜採用國貨為先，那末國貨百然容易暢銷了。</p>
<p>國貨旣能暢銷全國，國人旣能盡國民的天職，個個有服用國貨的心理，試觀國貨的前途，是絕無止境了，我國家的財源，是决不會流出外洋了。</p>
<p>帝國主義資本制度的野心，不惜鉅大數額的金錢，投資到中國來貿易，實行經濟侵略來壓榨我們，使我們的物品不能儘量的發展，使我國工商業永遠的被束縛着而落後，假如我們再不積極準備着自己創造和發明，用羣衆的工商業力量來抵制帝國主義工商業的壓迫，誠恐不久的將來，帝國中義會握住經濟的勢力來封銷我們</p>
<p>那末我們要使國家富裕，不得不先使金錢勿流出國外，要使金錢勿流出國外，那末又不得不服用國貨，如果我國將四萬萬八千萬同胞的數額來計算服用國貨成績，這也許是全地球上任何一個國家，都沒有這樣驚入的數目够比得上呢！像這種國民自動採用國貨法能實現，那怕國家不富裕呢！</p>
<p>一個國家旣不戚到財源的缺乏，那就是『國富，換一句話說，就是國家有錢，國家一富庶，還怕國不强盛嗎？</p>
<p>所以照一般窮人的目光看來，購用外貨，完全是出於有錢人們，穿西裝，吃大菜，住洋房，坐汽車，衣食住行，都是購從外洋，絕大的漏巵，不用我們窮人去挽回，我們日常生活所需的，更不用化一個錢去購外洋貨物，這一個理解，是認為最合理的。</p>
<p>我們現在最渴望的兩個辦法，使國貨能達到風行到處的目的，如下：</p>
<p>要使全國國貨廠商，積極研究製造機械材料，用種種科學方法來使國產出品勿倚賴外來機械，同時關於物質和原料各方面，應注意切實改良，勿將洋貨改頭換面，出品要迅速，價格取低廉，貨品能持久，勿粗製濫造。使國入能先有服用信仰心，俾可革除「外貨雖貴，貨色倒究牢固」的觀念。</p>
<p>要請求政府對於貿易國內和出口的貨物，减輕或免徵稅收，使國貨减輕成本，國貨廠商資本易於流動，那末出品勢所必然的增加，足可抵禦舶來品的威脅了，於其國貨廠商成本减輕，價格就不致昂貴，人民都能樂於購買了。</p>
<p>以上兩種原因和希望，關於國貨前途利害匪淺，自宜設法實施，但是要使一個國家能經濟富裕而勿漏巵國外，又必須先從完全購用國貨着手，　能達到國富民强的地位，與其空喊口號，不如研究實際，如果不如上述情形所辦，也許永遠不能克復舶來品的暢銷，國貨永遠沒有發揮的展望，我國工商業永遠被舶來品所壓束，國民購買國貨力的薄弱，也因之可想了，那末國富民强的根本法，也永遠渺茫了。</p>
<h3>信箋信封請用國貨</h3>
<p>— 闌删</p>
<p>上海市黨部最近奉令通飭各級黨部，有「嗣後中央曁各級黨部，所用印刷紙張及信箋信封，一切用紙，均須以國貨為標準，如有再購用外國紙張者，應由其主管人員負責處罰。」一條，紀錄在案。這是一件幷不微末的事情</p>
<p>查公務機關中，有不少採用洋紙印製箋封者，大概取其摩登好看吧？但該想想，各機關一日有多少信件寄發呢？這當然不是小數目吧！中國紙張不比洋貨為劣，我們為什麽捨國貨而不用，偏要整批整批的購用洋紙製的箋封呢？現在中央執行委員會旣有此項禁令，深願全國各機關一律遵從，以資提倡，而重國貨。其有洋紙箋封購存未用者，亦當於用罄後，不再添置，改用本國各種適用紙張。</p>
<p>至於靑年男女，在初戀期間，或則天涯地角，兩地相思，或朝夕相見，而面談不盡，有千言萬語，都賴情書之互通以達意。但據筆者觀察所得，此項情書，幾於什九寫在洋箋之上，封以美麗之洋式信封，此亦不利於國貨之一弊也。願許許多多親愛的兄弟姊妹們，嗣後如寫情書，亦當以愛國為念，不要再用洋紙，中國不少好箋封，其美觀潔淨，不在洋箋之下，大可用得。筆者在這兒套一個老調，「戀愛不忘救國，救國不忘戀愛。」以為諸位靑年朋友祝。則國紙前途幸甚諸位戀愛的成績亦必有成功的希望。</p>
<h3>提倡國貨應從兒童入手</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>提倡國貨，雖然是人入的天職，人入的義務，可是在我看來，如界要收到提倡國貨的永久成效，要築成提倡國貨的根本基礎，還得應該在兒童方面，切切實實的用一番工夫，使兒童們自一個服用國貨的習慣，恥用外國貨的心理，能够做到這種地步，才是我們提倡國貨的最遠大的目標。</p>
<p>的確，這是母庸諱言的，兒童的心地，是非常的純潔的；兒童的情緒，又是非常的熱烈的；兒童的愛國心，更是比較常人高出許多：我們不要輕視了小孩子的地位，不要藐視兒童的人格，要知道在兒童方面，訓練他們服用國貨的心理，實在比對民衆宣傳，要收效得多，這種工作，負敎育兒童的學校敎師們，和小孩子的家長們，實在是不能忽視的。</p>
<p>記得在某刊物上載有一段事實，說世界各國，對於訓練兒童服用國貨的鼓勵，異常重視。常把「恥用外國貨」或「服用國貨的口號」編入敎科書中，同時更製就牌子，貼於通衢，引起兒童的注意，頗能收效。標語的種類，現在摘錄幾首於左：</p>
<p>日本：小朋友！勿用外國貨，勿着外國布，勿吃外國物，最好還是日本貨，這樣才是好學生。</p>
<p>俄國：不用俄國貨的，便是沒出息，不愛國的亡國奴。</p>
<p>德國：小朋友！你們的衣服，鉛筆，紙簿，是外國貨嗎？請檢查一下！</p>
<p>其他如美國，英國，意國等等，都是引起兒童服用國貨的標語，張貼於行人注意的地方，茲因限於篇幅，姑不多贅。</p>
<p>總而言之，兒童是國家的命脈，是未來的主人翁，我們要使提倡國貨，收得一勞永逸的大成功。那末，對於兒童的服用國貨訓練，的確是一件刻不待緩的事。</p>
<h3>青年勸用國貨團在蕪情形</h3>
<p>— 耘飱</p>
<p>我們很久就有這種建議，提倡國貨的運動，不是單純的希望在上海五百萬人士身上，或是其他都會的若干萬入士身上；要推廣到各個單位的縣城！要勸用到下層大衆面前！這就敎做康莊要通，曲徑也要達；如何打開康莊與曲徑？一方面自然倚賴文字宣傳，另一方却要嘴巴和手脚，嘴巴演述，手脚奔波；譬如官廳裏貼告示，只可給識宇的人看，士大夫可以藉宣傳文字提倡國貨，但不能喩諸逖聽之小民；因此販夫走卒，就得需要實地勸用了；靑年志士梁桐芳等，他們本着受國熱忱！組織中華靑年勸用國貨促進團！遠走蘇·皖·贛·鄂等省的內地，實行其勸用政策；在上海得到工商業領袖潘仰堯等諸先生的同情贊助，於上月底出發成行，現在該團客决懷寗，已把停驂蕪湖的工作報吿，簡略的寄到上海了；他們的樣品展覽室，是假座省立第二民衆敎育館，曾經出席過一次靑年會的音樂會，由團員范仁良演講國貨救國；在商會舉行過兩决談話會，與工商代表交換發展工商意見；四大樣品展覽，計參觀者二千零三十六人，其間還有日商北田重决二人；他們在報吿中說過：「該縣黨部，對國貨運動，置若罔聞，屢見未晤；」到縣政府，也你推他諉；我以為碰兩决壁，並不納罕，足見內地對提倡國貨的觀念淺，該團勸用國貨的工作迫切了！他們住的問題，是隨寓而安的，沒有借旅店，倒像恢復了原始時代的游牧生活，今天這裏，明天那裏，這一點很欽佩該團的吃苦耐勞；最後我再抄一段工商和特產的調查，工商：電氣公司一，麫粉公司一，榨油廠一，石灰鑛一，煤鑛二；特產：鐵花，籘枕，皆為手工業；鐵花每年出口，銷售頗多，原料近年多用外鐵；籘枕，夏日用之，從事製造者多婦孺；其餘敎育，交通，社會，因為和國貨關係較輕，恕不一一備錄了。</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （大木）</p>
<p>要水發出蒸汽的力量，必須把水燒到二百十二度的溫度，二百度不成，二百十度也辦不到，一定要沸騰後，纔能發出蒸汽，轉動機器及火車。目下有許多靑年，都在用着溫熱的水，或將沸未沸的水，去推動他們的生命之火車。同時，還詫異着，為什麽事業總不能向前突進？</p>
<p>一位博學的醫師說：『人要享天年，須除睡眠時間外，使腦部不斷的活動，又須於職業工作外，找一種正當嗜好，職業給人以生活之資，嗜好則給人以興趣。「動作」的意義等於「生命，」「靜止」則等於「死亡」！』其言不無理由。</p>
<p>做我們所高興做的事，做我們所喜歡而感到熱誠的事，這是很容易的。但是，要全神貫注地去做那種不快的，討厭的，為我們內心所反對的，而同時又為了不得已的緣故，不得不去做的事，那就需要非常的勇氣，與非常的耐性了。認定了一個大目標，固執着認為乏味的職位，以全力赴之，這便是英雄的精神，為庸入所不可及。</p>
<h3>藏稿費的壜子</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>文人賣稿，事至辛苦；稿費被竊，允深心痛。我有一位朋友，就不幸遭著這厄運的。</p>
<p>那位朋友前當敎書匠的時候，所得除七折八扣之外，雖僅能餬口；然而他個人自己的購書，應酬，娛樂等費則俱無著了。這，不但是我的朋友如此，和他同病相憐的恐怕滔滔皆是吧。幸得他一枝筆能提得起，因此日則揩黑板，吸粉筆灰；夜則一燈熒熒，埋頭著作，想撈幾個外快錢。他常受他夫人的催寢，可是他總巧妙地說，「在編講義。」這樣，便把他夫人瞞過了，因為伊是文盲啊。</p>
<p>積久，他居然蓄有一筆成欵了。這，在他是如何欣喜，因為個入經濟，已能自主，從此可不必再仰求他夫人，而效那「猫嘴裏挖鰍」的所為了！不過這筆「私欵，」如何妥藏，倒也是一個大問題。當初，他曾躊躇不定者久之；後來終被他找到一隻、「保險箱」了，遂把私欵」盡藏其中。</p>
<p>那隻「保險箱是什麽呢」？說也有趣，是　間夾衖裏的一隻蜘網塵封的壜子！這壜子頗能忠於其主，克盡厥職，妥為保藏，從不中飽；所以每當他主人到　間裹和他夫人搭訕的時候，它心中不免在暗笑，而他也耍向它行個注目禮。</p>
<p>不料厄運來了。一天夜裏，他家突碰著掘洞賊。損失甚微，他夫人雖尙可自慰；然而不幸他的「私欵，」已化為烏有了。事後，他暗地開壜，呌苦不迭，只好苦笑道：「這倒也是一樁雅事！」</p>
<p>寄語賣文的同道們：稿旨盍「韞櫝而藏諸！」</p>
<h3>禁山</h3>
<p>— 朱少飛</p>
<p>桑樹枝頭的葉兒銅元那麽大了，枇杷一個個也在放靑，嫩茅柴也長得過脚背的季節，大街邊的牆壁上那條寫着；「本村擇於×月×日舉行禁山會」的黃紙通吿條又貼上了。</p>
<p>禁山是故鄕「東山」每個村莊的莊戶年常舉行的舊規，為了防着貪小的偷果木，偸割人家的靑茅柴做羊食，凡是村裏莊戶都得拿出幾百文作會份，便可喫上一天的酒肉飯。同時猛將堂掛了年常照抄錄下的禁山罰規，如採枇杷一隻罰銅鑼十面，桑葉一斤罰旗傘幾頂等等的條例，雖是分了家的親弟兄拿到了也得公議罰欵的，罰下的助猛將會，罰後的就永遠沒加入禁山會的份了。</p>
<p>嘡嘡的銅鑼聲一陣陣傳到我們的巷裏來，明天又是禁山的日子了，我們弟兄四個兒都沒份參加禁山會，不參加已有十多年了，因為爸爸在世時採錯了已分了家的大伯伯園裏的枇把，給大伯伯報告罰了十面鑼，會份永遠取消了。</p>

<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第一回　品茗作清談夜窗聽雨　折枝　艷影花巷流芳</p>
<p>平山不免一伸脚更舉着雙手打了兩個呵欠，因道：這些無聊的話、我說得太多了。未免耽誤了你的夜課，我要告辭了。國器笑道：我已經交代過了，你在這裏，並不耽誤我的工夫。平山道：不坐了，我留下一個約會罷。假如明日天晴，我們一塊到雞鳴寺喝壺茶去，也好看看雨後的春山。假使天雨，我在家裏，預備好了爐火茶葉。等你下了課，到我家裏去煮茗清談。國器道：這倒抱歉得很。本來今天晚上，我們就可以煮茗淸談的，無奈我家裏的女僕，今天是剛剛歇工。我待要自己動手，又怕家母看着不過意。他倒會來替我去做。所以你來之後，我只把籘包裏藏着的這壺熱茶相敬。說着，他又把書桌角落裏茶几上放的那個籐包打開，提着包裏面的茶壺柄。平山搖搖手笑道：你這壺茶留着你慢慢的受用罷。我知道，你今晚上是不會燒茶的。像你這樣的體貼慈母，我有點生子當如孫仲謀之感了。國器連連拱着手笑道：謬獎！其實一個人的境遇，很可以造成他一種性情。家母在十二分貧困的家境裏面，撫養到我成人，不必在書本上找什麼父母之恩的話來敎訓我，我親眼所見，已經十分知道家慈受了多少年的苦了。到現在，我不能怎樣讓家母享福，我總也應該讓老人心裏安慰些。平山本是站起來要走，聽了他這一篇話，却又微側了身子，昻着頭想了一想。笑道：我又要回到前題了。像你這樣的身世，必定要有一個新思想，而又富於舊道德的女子才適合做你的夫人，這條件太多，果然不易。國器向前握住他的手搖撼了幾下，笑首彼此說着笑話，你何必當一個問題來討論？這樣的說法，本來近於幻想，世界上有幻想值得討論的嗎？平山和他說着話，已經是慢慢的向外走。國器兩手捧了那盞玻璃罩子煤油燈，就走到堂屋裏來，替他照路。不想一陣　風，帶了許多雨烟　直撲了進來，把燈就撲滅了。國器道：呵喲！眼前這更透着黑，你留心一點走。平山道：不要緊，不要緊，這是熟路。呵哎！國器道：怎麼了？平山笑道：踏在水溝裏，踩了一脚的水了。國器道：你等一會，我再去點燈出來。說着話走進房去點燈。可是點了燈再出來的時候，平山已經是去遠了。（一八）</p>
<h3>四種氣質的人</h3>
<p>— 胡楚玉</p>
<p>從一滴眼淚，就可以判斷其人的氣質！道是最近發見的實話。在醫學上硏究起來，無論那一個人，其所出的涕淚，唾液，汗，以及排泄的糞尿，舉凡人體所有的體液中，仔細檢查起來，就可以診斷共人的氣質的。所以不論帽子，手套，手巾，牙籤，袴襠，等等，附着人體所出的體液或分泌液的，都可以為判斷的資料。為什麽理由呢？簡單的一句話，就是血液型的研究結果。據一九〇一年蘭特司泰奈爾氏硏究所發明，人的血液，因血球凝集的反響，可以分出O，AB，AB，等四種血液型，其間經過了三十餘年之間，靠蘭氏的發明，在醫學上應用於輸血，種皮，換肌，以及遺傳學，法醫學，人類學，心理學，各方面眞是可驚的發達。自血液型而判別人體有共通的氣質，而且因其體液而知共人的血液型的。至於鑑定血液型，僅取了血液而知血球的凝集反應，同時從體液可以判斷其人的氣質，因為體液是血液中除了血球的東西與血液有同樣凝集的原素，且與血液以同樣的方法，可明白其人的血液型的。據古川竹二氏的研究，各血液型的特質如下：　O型的人，是不能為感情所驅使，極不客氣，但很直爽，不容易為他人所左右，精神堅强，决斷事情不會迷惑，自信力很强的。　A型的人，其性質溫厚，很用心事物，但對於各事，容易受迷惑，又極感動，不願與人爭辯是非，情願自己吃虧的。　B型的人，是極洒落，遇事恬靜，好談快活話，極抱樂觀，應酬圓滑，任事最好炫耀的。　AB型的人，其氣質相矛盾，極難判斷，外表為B型質，內面為A氣質的。其他又有在A型與B型中，各有多少O型混入的，大概A型及AB型的人，為消極的氣質，O型及B型的人，是積極的氣質的。</p>

<h3>人面狐與美人尾</h3>
<p>— 愛梅</p>
<p>說起來，這件事已有好多天了；那時，我常到五馬路中央書店編輯所去，找鄭逸梅兄談天，每次都見有一家鬥前，站着幾個北方老　，執着籘鞭，在喊着：「喂！來看呀！人而的狐狸，還有長着尾巴的美人；來！來！八個子兒一看。」門前牆上，還懸掛着兩張月份牌式的畫圖，　着那一人面狐與美人尾」的模型。我想：「以前遊藝塲裏，常有什麼三條腿的人，生了尾的人，以及什麽蟹背美人之類展覽，我雖沒有見過，其實，人不過是怪胎所產，蟹却出於人工偽造，現在道怪人，怪物，也無非是前述之二類而巳。」因此，從不曾進去觀光。</p>
<p>後來，這玩藝兒搬到新閘路去了，離我所居極近；便有好奇的朋友，跑去參觀，回來吿訴我說：「這絕不像是喬扮的；那狐狸的確生就的人面狐身，那美人（？）也眞個天然的生着肉尾。」那末，這自然是都屬於怪胎一類的了；但，我始終沒有興緻去賞鑒。</p>
<p>最近，聽見一位老者，談了件驚心動魄的故事，却使我對這「人面狐和美人尾，」引起了注意的心了。那老者談的是：「江湖賣藝者流，大半不是善類；曾有一個頑狗熊的，那隻狗熊，不獨技藝甚精，而且能作人言；有位刑幕老夫子，瞧見起了疑心，便向本官進言，出其不意的，將賣藝的連同狗熊，拘提到案；那狗熊果然當堂雙淚直流，訴說：自已本是人身，十二歲時，被這賣藝的所拐，隨他賣了幾年藝，因為捕到一頭狗熊，即便將來殺死，剝下了皮，却將此人皮膚割破，把來包在狗熊皮裏，人血熊血，互相膠結，又拿針綫縫結一過，人與狗熊，就此合而為一，因着茸茸長毛，却也了無痕迹。官庭據供，當將賣藝的按律治罪，但這被害的人，可憐終無法回復他的人身了。這是遜消光緒年間的事。據說：這類慘劇很多，但，大都給他吃了毒品，不能說話，所以，無由發現，只好寃沉海底罷了！」</p>
<p>聽了這種話頭，使我不能不在懷疑，心想：這「人面狐與美人尾，」不要也是這一套吧！但，現在走過新閘路時，又巳不在那裏了，因此，無從親自一看，不知又搬到那條路上去陳列？抑或巳離去上海否？</p>
<p>我認為：這種事情，大家很有研究的必要！</p>

<h3>「白門心影」讀後感</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>前幾天我還故鄕去，預算往返的行程，消磨在舟車中，要十小時，正苦沒有消遣品，恰巧老友易君左，從鎭汀靑雲門半月社寄給我一部「白門心影』，便做了我的解語之伴。</p>
<p>我初看陶默庵女士的題詞。。「著者肯以二十萬言生花怒放之筆，替一個奇女子立傳，這女子假使眞有的話，對他一定是極同情，而且很感謝的。」和君左的序：「我有一個最要好的朋友，叫做花蹊舊友。……為着人類偉大的同情心，為着探索宇宙的光和熱和力，終於以一個女子為題材，而慷慨地接受了悲劇美人之請，以十八章二十餘萬言的大手筆，傳了這樣一個可歌可泣的人。」也給他蒙住了，以為這部小說的作者，是花蹊舊友。並且作者還有自序云：「世或以此書為默庵之影乎？則非！不以為默庵之影乎？亦非！是是非非，固無從斷定也。」但是看了幾回，便知道那些話，都是文人的狡獪，明明白白是把陶默庵女士作為此書的女主人；喬靜軒便是伊的幻名。</p>
<p>陶女士是端午橋的姪女，北平有名的女票友，伊的遭遇，非常悽苦，我看了，雖然沒有下淚，却也為之輙　奈何。在新舊過渡的時代，封建氣息充滿着的家庭裏，力求解放而不得的弱女子，是很多的。所以此書，可以說是單純化的現代紅樓夢。</p>
<p>此書以前是在南京的救國日報發表的，據說當時偶然中斷了一個月，讀者投函詢問的有如雪片之來。可知他的吸引力竟如此偉大！就我的觀感說，此書的特點，在能把舊時章回小說的壞處，都淘汰乾凈，而用一種不甚過火的新的筆姿，去描寫細膩的心情，因此中間很多具有哲理的論調，溶化在作者的表白裏。而書中人的劉白，又是能免掉文藝成分過重的失眞的弊病，這是使讀者覺得輕快鬆脆，而不肯放手的力量。</p>
<p>辛亥革命的社會反映，在過去的小說裏，巳寫得不少了。可是國民革命軍北伐，這樣一回政治大轉變，還少一種用小筆墨去寫大局面的作品，使後人知道些當時民衆的動態。那麼「白門心影」這部書，就是負着道使命的。於此我們可以知道作者寫得如此輕而易舉，的確其才不小！</p>
<p>柳亞子先生在上月到首都，和君左一見如故，並且題了二十八字在這書上云：「隃麋三斛淚千絲，寫盡人間絕代姿，倘許狂生留一面，遠山眉黛幸同時。」頗能道出作者苦心。因為亞子也是夙聞默庵女士的身世，而頗想一見其人，所以有此說法。但是說得也閃爍，也沒有說出有無其人，詩人畢竟是慣於狡獪的。</p>
<p>我揭穿了作者的秘密，或者為作者所弗許。不過我有一樁事，或者可使作者稍稍解慍的，就是我正在和某影片公司商量，把這部書改編為電影劇本，使作者的苦心，借着銀屏的映現，更多得些偉大的同情者。</p>

<h3>紗花　紗市平疲不前</h3>
<p>市盤一時難望轉升</p>
<p>紗市平靜、形勢萎疲、蓋以紗銷未見十分發展、且棉市不振、多數心理傾向空方、故市盤一時不易轉昇、不過有一部份意態漸漸移轉、由空翻多、　量殊鉅云、</p>
<p>標紗近漲遠跌</p>
<p>標紗前市開槃、各月依然下落、因海外紗花市況無力、場中賣戶活動、市價平常、但一盤以後、合興續來買進、檯面被其維持、氣勢轉定、結果近月比上日收盤價漲三角、遠月勿動、午後開盤、聞現紗交易尙稱不惡、蜀帮胃口稍開、人氣較緊、各月均漲二·三角、迨至三收盤、合興父賣出、大阪三品紗來電跌二元三·四角、檯風忽鬆、市價趨落、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌一·二·四角、查賣出大豐一千零五十包、明德七百包、賽豐一千零五十包、愼記一千二百五十包、仁豐七百包、元一五百五十包、信誠五百包、長和五百五十包、泰昌五百五十包買進聚興一千三百五十包、合興一千二百五十包、長餘五百包、永昌五百五十包、澄記五百包、恒益五百包、泰興九百包、長豐八百包、同和六百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>紗銷一千六百包</p>
<p>現紗銷路尙佳、查全日各幫買去統計一千六百包、售價漲五角、各帮買額列下、</p>
<h3>近期棉多頭維持</h3>
<p>棉市晨堅午疲、市態仍屬平庸、良以大批粗絨棉缺乏需要、故同業心思仍然看低、同時現棉廠需不暢、海外印美棉市下挫、惟合興努力購進矣、</p>
<p>標花德大合豐拖進</p>
<p>標花前市　盤、因美棉南方套賣而跌三至八磅音、印棉跌風亦熾、跌〇·五至二羅比二五、大阪三品花跌三四五角、市場人心不振、但近月多方仍來加碼、市象稍緊、惟遠月略鬆、二盤以後、合興仁豐長豐續來吸收、　買勢猛烈、惟賡豐潤康信誠空頭步步加碼、結果各月比上日收盤均漲一角半至二三角、午後開盤市狀仍緊、德大猛力買進、但入後有一部分多頭吐出、及紗市乏力、迨至收盤、復人疲途、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌五分至一角、查賣出源大一千九百擔、聚興三千一百擔、裕大三千一百擔、賡豐九千六百擔、愼昌二千五百擔、元三千八百擔、潤康五千七百擔、信誠三千七百擔、源與昌六千一百擔、大昶一千九百擔、長餘一千七百擔、買進德大九千七百擔、吉豐三千三百擔、合興七千二百擔、仁豐三千五百擔、長豐八千七百擔、益唐四千三百擔、興昌一千一百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>現棉消費殊形岑寂、廠商均持觀望態度、夾源姚花二百八十包、通花八十包、</p>
<h3>海外棉花跌多漲少</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市况極呆、近月因同業買進、漲四磅音、遠月因西南棉區週末獲雨、外商賣出及棉農套售、跌六磅音、買戶謹愼、國外政局、殊形不安、其後陳棉因囤棉處在一角一分五厘二毫時、售出五月期、亦見回小、賣戶不多、趨勢尙穩、計現貨漲一磅音、期貨漲一磅音至跌八磅音、英棉現貨跌六點、期貨跌七八點、印棉初有小數投機家買進、旋以銀圓跌落、投機家賣出而疲、日商進出均有、計平果爾跌〇·五至〇·七五羅比、奧姆辣跌一至一·二五羅比、白羅溪跌二至二·二五羅比、原電錄左、（四日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、五日七八月期白羅溪花開盤預測爲一百九十八羅比、較上日跌半羅比、</p>
<p>三品紗花跌勢殊强</p>
<p>五日大阪電、三品期紗跌一元二角至二元一角、近月爲一百九十六元、遠月爲一百九十四元二角、期棉跌叫角五分至六角五分、近月爲六十四元一角、遠月爲五十八元八角、</p>
<h3>疋頭棉布南幫紛起採購</h3>
<p>貨價因亦賴以跌定</p>
<p>咋日棉布疋頭、因連跌多日之後、貨價亦隨標紗花而漸趨平定、各客帮靜極思動、除北路靑津等埠、依然呆頓、餘外各地、如浙皖川粵均起採辦、福建亦略見動銷、當以川帮爲較佳、續進光華廠孝感牌·義豐廠鑽蜂牌·裕源恒廠舞蝶牌·及大公仁諸廠出品藍布、元灰色細料紋、總共成交四百餘件、廣帮續進加官·跑狗·雲鼎等牌細斜、人魚·雲獅·元實　牌細布、雙鳳新條府綢等貨三百餘件、浙路溫台諸埠亦添辦本廠細布·觕布·花色貨七八十件、甬帮進西貨華嘉素府綢、本廠麗新華陽中檔索府綢、下身兀洋紗廿餘箱、</p>
<h3>白嗶嘰雖漲尙無多貨</h3>
<p>暑天需銷之毛貨呢絨、刻下出路均旺、白色素嗶嘰、申市非常軋缺、市氣甚爲堅挺、售價較之其他呢絨類爲昂、蓋國貨出品粗糙、舶來品到埠頗缺、其所到者成本較上年爲賣、若豐裕白嗶　、上年每碼祇四兀五角、今夏每碼均須五元四五角、致開盤價亦驟升、前售二元七八角之日本白嗶嘰、今則一律喊售三元五六角、執有實貨者亦尙不多、</p>
<h3>絲茶　出口絲銷轉機　白廠經又漲十五元</h3>
<p>天寒蠶汛不能樂觀</p>
<p>邇央本埠絲市、日漸繁榮、頗覺景氣、各出口行均有相當進胃、白廠經二〇－二二條份均吿漲十五元許、昨日法匯　長、歐銷稍滯、且本埠廠商鑒及天時陰寒、春雨連綿、有礙幼蠶發育、故今春蠶收、殊不能完全樂觀、因此蠶本咸皆看高、而目前絲商、亦不欲輕易拋售、故昨日本埠市氣已呈淸堅之局、僅達昌信孚等各有二三十包交易云、</p>
<h3>屯溪新茶出產旺盛</h3>
<p>近日屯溪新茶、各路來源、已有五六千擔集中、聞因天時尙佳、出產頗爲旺盛、一般殷實號家、業巳從事搜買趕製、惟多數茶莊、亟盼滬上棧家卽日開兌、在現時尙未普遍競買之際、毛茶售價、每擔僅祇五十七八元、將來開兌之後、市價定當激漲云、</p>
<h3>溫州新茶今日上市</h3>
<p>浙省各路毛茶均報漲</p>
<p>來路莊之溫州新茶、本市公升、永茶棧巳運到紅茶叫十餘箱、珍眉綠茶二十箱、因公會决定今日開市、准可照常佈樣、以應洋行需要云、浙省蕭山·諸曁·天運·遂安·上虞·餘姚等路毛茶、昨據各方傳來消息、市盤均一律報漲、其原因實由於上海莊號需要大增諸暨蕭山等路茶、己由五十七八元、漲至六十三四元、遂安高莊貨業已提高至八十元、其餘亦均升漲一二元至三四元不等云、</p>
<h3>糧食　廠商拋賣　麵粉跌風重起</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈先定後漲、繼復疲跌之象、洋麥報價、芝加哥好一二三角不等、坎拿大小四分零、當開價時、以市面連跌幾日、一部分浮空、未免均思抵補、兼之廠方觀望未聞續出、故一方業外收買、一方則空　暢抵、各月份遂步步回漲　三分、迨至下午開盤、形勢忽又大變、因天時頗佳、本外埠廠家、又一致暢拋、故跌風重起、交易大旺、計上午做四十餘萬包、下午至七十餘萬包、價較上午收價計回跌二三四分、較前日跌一二分不等、照目下情形、以廠方已開始拋賣、此後如天時順遂、麥收有望、市而尙難穩固云、</p>
<h3>期麥午後隨粉市回跌</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份呈見回振、下午則又回跌、因市場人心、大跌小回、爲投機市場、應有之動態、故各月份開價、即較前日漲起二三分、交易亦因籌碼擴大、驟形暢旺、迨至下午　盤、因粉市旣先回跌、大部分之行家多頭、紛紛暢脫、市面遂又急轉直下、開價即小三四分、後續小二三分、此後情形、一方看麥收如何、一方當以粉市爲轉移也、現麥市面、存底雖枯、惟以標凖大跌、價亦鬆動、聞减價已低至五元一角半、交易無多云、</p>
<p>美國小麥市况、西南慶獲甘霖、收盤前之買進、聞係期待明日發表之估計將利多頭、並因可見供給减少一，五九八，〇〇〇斛、然觀於目下作物狀况之佳、價格恐難大漲也、加麥估計减少一五三，〇〇〇斛、</p>
<h3>河下米滯銷市況平疲</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源尙惟二十餘號、（貨共四千餘石）、本街銷場動而不爽、包胄仍祇天津辦百餘包、故市况不以連朝到稀而市轉機、僅見平平耳、若爲早粳及薄稻行情悉無榮辱、杜洋尖及陰變元亦相仿、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮到船二十四五號、晨刻天陰，白粳去路續化、價喊緊數分、午市天宮放晴、零胃轉懈、結果市價仍屬定局、薄稻到頭不旺、包胃稍動、價形緊扣、陰元亦見緊勢、其餘各貨價形均無上落、</p>
<h3>客秈跌風已戢洋米有到</h3>
<p>昨日客秈到頭續有長江與溫台等帮、惟本街實銷續旺、且有倉庫軍需等需要、連日疲滯無神之空氣、已被完全掃除、行囤拋賣亦不似日前之心處力弱、故跌風已停、市轉穩定之局、全日開出江西米九千多包、湘米四百包、台溫米三百五十包、江西米五百包、統計開出一萬多包、後市如消化不衰、市價或有轉好之望、否則亦盤旋而已、</p>
<p>西貢米六千餘包、昨晨由法公司鎮奴沙號運來、起卸於招商局北棧、聞該項洋米尙須轉運長江云、</p>
<p>四月下旬糧價統計</p>
<p>二十　日－三十日</p>
<h3>南北貨　海口枝花苗絕盛</h3>
<p>本届可望豐收</p>
<p>海口荔枝去年因收成歉薄、貨底早經吿斷、茲據產區確息、本年新苗頗佳、花蕊茂盛、如無颶風等患、將來新貨登場、當有十足收成云、</p>
<h3>雜路苦杏仁跌二元</h3>
<p>苦杏　近　到貨見增、而去胃反呆、故市價轉跌、昨雜路貨行售二十七元、前後降去二元、惟聞封貨品質較高、而存數亦少、市尙穩定、開過</p>
<p>十八　、聞　價近己站住、後市可望暫無上</p>
<h3>五金　烟皮鐵廠銷猛進</h3>
<p>烟皮鐵自搪磁廠停辦後、市氣久形冷落、前昨以來、熱水瓶廠·兵工廠·及小機器廠等銷路猛進不已、成交達四五千担之多、市上之十八張·十三張·九張·十張·及四五張等花色、走勢飛俏、行情因青黃不接、所以節節上進、十八張每担售九元二有半、十三張售十元、九張十張皆開九元七角半、四張五張則開九元二角半、查市上存底單薄、到貨不繼、嗣後市盤有續好之望、</p>

<h3>淋疾內服藥之選擇</h3>
<p>— 芝明</p>
<p>淋疾為一難治之疾症，而其治法亦甚夥，在昔只利用局部洗滌療法，雖亦時有此效，但痛苦殊甚，在現在只當牠是治法之一，而不專事利賴了，近世的治淋法，可謂極盡美善之能事，（電）電療法，淋疾有急性慢性之分，電械亦有最新療濁機及短透熱電機之別，（二）注射法，如色素製劑及混合淋苗等，均能透膜殺菌或自身免疫而應大效，（三）洗滌法，於今又有尿道注入之淋病血淸軟膏之發明，旋用旣便利，收效亦準確，此種製劑中當推德國滿爾志大藥廠出品之「淋毒舒樂耳」Gono-gerol為最佳，（四）內服藥，查此類製劑，市上最為多見，然考其功效，率皆不確，欲圖選擇準確，殊不易，余臨床施用，惟喜「滅殺淋」Mesalin，因該藥不但具有强力之殺菌作用，且兼有消炎鎭痛制腐利尿諸功，屢經應用，靡不應效，誠淋病之勁敵也。</p>
<h3>神經衰弱與遺精</h3>
<p>— 仁智</p>
<p>遺精一症，有為生理的，殊未可一槪以病理視之，但在臨床所見，率皆為病的現象，考此等症候之發生，什九為惡習摧殘，或房事過度所致，其初也，雖僅夜眠夢遺洩精，迨後則性機能或完全衰退，如早洩，陰萎等現象發生是，此際已屆性神經衰弱之期，不但生育無望，且也，痼症堪虞，斯時若再不加治療，而任意置之，則病熱增劇，可造成腦神經衰弱，亦可謂全身神經衰弱之症，此時所發現的普見症候，如失眠，記憶不佳，精神倦怠，頭重頭暈等，此等病候之治療，要不外滋補其經經系統而已，滋補神經之藥，其最著者，一為有機性燐，從植物之莖根中採得者，二為內分泌製劑，從動物各內分泌腺提出者，此二者均為使已衰弱之神經，恢復健全之良劑，對於此類藥物，近今已有專製劑之發明，本埠仁壽西藥社經售之『安爾神』Arolis乃有機性燐與內分泌製劑之混合製品，對於遺精，早洩等性神經衰弱，旣具確被，對於頭暈失眠等腦神經衰弱，又奏宏效，故可稱許神經衰弱之聖藥，駕乎一切凡品之上也。</p>
<h3>淋毒性關節炎</h3>
<p>— 承德</p>
<p>淋毒性關節炎，乃淋毒性病患之一種，其原因胥由於淋病，故淋病之初起，宜斬草除根，澈底治療，否則必遺後患，初次感染淋病，其症候尚輕，恒為急性前尿道炎，斯時若即內服「滅殺淋」Mesalin及幷行「淋毒舒樂耳」Gon-Seroil之外用，自是可將淋菌撲滅，淋病即可根治，若遷延不治，或治療不甚合法，淋菌未能淨殺，於焉淋菌即漸侵入後尿道，從急性而進為亞急性，再進而成慢性，循此侵入膀胱，則成膀胱炎，侵入攝護腺，則成攝護腺炎，侵入睾丸，則成睾丸炎，侵入某關節，則成某關節炎，發淋毒性關節炎時，患處多從腫而疼痛，每易誤診急性屢麻質斯，是不可不注意，治療本症時，除需追原因的治療，予以淋菌代克辛之注射，如Gonagin及Arthigon等均堪應用之他如電氣療法中之短波透熱電，局部應用頗效，茲物之使用如·劑及一切消炎頻痛者，均可衡情使用，本症治療準確，靡有不愈，但錯過治療期，或荏苒經時，則恢復之後，恐難復完美之恒態，常見患肢稍短，或發育似不甚全者，胥皆是病之故也。</p>
<h3>癬之治療</h3>
<p>— 靜之</p>
<p>癬之種類殊多，但其同為皮膚病則一，除所謂魚鱗癬殖全治外，大槪都可根治，其所以荏苒不愈者，率皆錯誤治療，或不全治療所致也。本症傳染極易，皮膚面相接觸或物質的媒可，即可傳染，時發時愈，視素候而異，但此愈乃潛伏非眞愈也，大率秋冬為潛伏期而春夏為發作期，也有因身體情狀地理關係而偶異，本痛若不潛心治療根治難期，考癬之來原，厥為傳染，其皮膚抵抗力薄弱者更易，通常醫家病家咸視為無足輕重之症，鮮少注意治療，安知澈底醫愈，亦非易事，如魚鱗癬然，癬之治療，藥物方面，晚近已有專製劑之發明，德藥之滅絕菌Misluzine為治癬之良劑，該藥有深透皮膚之功能，且不碍內臟，得將潛在之癬菌，撲殺淨盡，且其氣味馨郁，不汚衣被，尤為病家所樂用，謂之皮膚病聖藥，誠非虛語，電械方面，有高山人工太陽燈及柯羅梅亞燈，均為極有效之帮助。</p>
<h3>胃痛治療法</h3>
<p>— 善田</p>
<p>胃痛乃一習見之症候，因其無甚大碍，患者輒不盡加醫治，致復發之機會增多，有荏苒終身者，良可憫也，致發胃痛之原因，不外急性胃加答兒，慢性胃加答兒，胃酸過多症，胃液漏等所引起的症狀，考此種疾患的治療，求之藥物，含亞爾加里劑外，實莫屬，但此種製劑，市上所發售者，多不勝數，有有麻醉性成分之藥物混在其中者，則服後雖立時見愈，然病因以未能澈底根治，反使遷延者，故治病雖先貴診斷，但擇藥不可不愼，若此種胃痛之亞爾加里製劑之藥，依余所知，其不含麻醉性藥物而能止痛消炎調節胃之生理運動機能者，莫「胃寳」若，此藥不但治胃痛有效，即急慢性胃加答兒，胃醉過多症及胃液漏等，均有迅即獲愈之效，他如消化不良，則服之更可使胃之運動整復，誠良藥也，又胃痛症在治療期間及獲愈以後，一方面須繼續服用「胃寳」，以期全治，一方面須禁忌辛辣硬固等有刺激性及不易消化之食物！</p>
<h3>疾病問答</h3>
<p>讀者諸君凡有疾病上之疑問，均可投函垂詢，來函須書寫淸楚，如問題多可列一二三四以分列之，病情和經過，須詳細扼要說明，須書面答覆者·本埠請附復件郵票二分。外埠請附郵票五分。寄上海郵政信箱一六六八號，自當專函答覆。</p>

<p>（答）此係下疳症，有兼發橫痃之虞，下疳有軟硬性之別，或甚為軟硬性混合者，如確為軟硬性合併者，則須用驅梅療法，如六〇六，九一四，阿散地拉等之注射，更須兼行下疳菌苗德美高斯之注射，局所之消毒防腐，亦屬緊要，本埠法租界寗波路六六號春在醫院統治花柳性病，置有各項電械，可前診治，下疳為梅毒之初期，若不根治，可進為二期，軟下疳不即治愈，可日益擴大，且此處潰爛過大，即全愈後，亦難復常態。</p>
<p>患胃病症</p>

<p>（李子平君問）數年前鄙人偶染白濁，旋醫即愈，但時時復發，不勝其苦，據敝友言，老白濁須幷行短波電療，方克奏全功，請問（一）短波透熱電對於淋病奏何項之效，（二）海上何醫院有是項機械之設備，（三）尚需其他治療否。</p>
<p>（答）（一）短波透熱電乃利用其電力熱力以撲殺潛生之淋菌，（二）本埠法租界寗波路六六號春在醫院有是欠電械之設備該院對於淋病之治療，法至完善，（三）其他治療，甚極需要，如注射，洗射，內服等等。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>廣州取締奇裝妖服</h3>
<p>— 丁尼</p>
<p>去年已曾一度喧傳，廣州當局雷厲風行取締奇裝妖服，因辦法不善而至弄出笑話百端。今年轉眼又春盡夏至了，所謂袒胸露臂的奇裝妖服又將上市，素以愛管小事，專趨復古的廣州當局，重申取締的禁令，是一件很在意中的事。本月二日某報廣州特訊載：自五月五日起，由公安局女訓練員擔任在各馬路為勸喻工作，切實執行，務使不准有妖裝婦女出現。這，也許是一件政績吧。</p>
<p>女訓練員是月前公安局招攷錄取的，且已受「訓」多時。現在有了這一種特殊的工作，眞可以說是儲材待用，旣可見當局的一番苦心，又可說他們的「大材小用，」因為天大的國難不去管，偏愛在女人身上尋花樣，「氽脫木排撩銅勺柄」眞是無聊得很，這些多是提倡復古，讀經尊孔，抱殘守缺的遺毒。</p>
<p>應否取締奇裝妖服這大問題我們不要去談，實在談起來也不是一椿容易事。現在，我們還是把眼界縮小一點，單從取締方法的行得通與行不通這一方面來看看吧。在特訊中，我們看到辦法還是和去年一模一樣，至於結果，那也很可想而知了。若果眞有效，則所謂奇裝妖服的女子，早已不敢招搖過市，何必雷厲風行，用强迫手段去强迫執行呢？至於眞正穿了奇裝妖服招搖過市的妖婦，那倒是例外的，她們是給貴人們象鳥兒般豢養着的，便是到馬路上來也是在汽車廂裏，伴着的是貴人，衛士，那又如何敢勸喻，更如何敢强迫。由此，所謂「取締」又不外是一種拿老百姓開玩笑的官樣文章吧了。不過，這樣措施和其他政績如「男女分泳」，「男女分行」等比擬，則又堂皇冠冕得多了。</p>
<h3>養鳥的故事</h3>
<p>— 斯全</p>
<p>我記得很淸楚的，我們每天為那些小動物要費去許多時候，早上把一個個籠子提到走廊裏掛着，飼淸水，換鳥食，還有一套洗浴工作，但是大家做得很高興。吃過中飯，提了幾個籠上茶館去。那裏幾乎都是養鳥的茶客，烟霧，吵鬧充滿着那間小小的屋子；他們品評着鳥的優劣，談論着鳥的故事；有的臨着窗口，把手裏的鳥籠抬過頭頂，自己學着鳥鳴，引動籠子裏的鳥也嘰嘰呌起來，於是高興地瞟着眼角去窺視抬在他人手裏的鳥籠。起初就沒有方法把自己停留在那裏較長的時間，但是父親却處之泰然，他幾乎完全消失了平時嚴肅的態度，他能够在那些鳥主人中間撩天，講笑話，後來父親，大哥和廚子竟三位一體是那茶館的老主顧了。有一天飯後，我想躱過那差遺，故意在院子裏收拾鴿棚，但是父親隔着窗在客廳裏呌了起來：</p>
<p>「阿斯，放着讓老冲（一個男僕人）去做罷。今天帶那個新買來的芙蓉去，看那個老傢伙還有什麼話說：誰敢說我家裏沒有好鳥！」</p>
<p>父親養鳥是討大哥的歡心，但是後來却是好勝心逼着他非養鳥不可了。大哥就遺傳着父親的個性，他的離開家庭，就想用自己的力量來養活自己，他不願依靠父親一世。那時候父子兩個的好勝心完全放到鳥的身上去了。買得一個</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>好鳥的時候，總有三整天談話離不了那只鳥。</p>
<p>但是養鳥的故事沒有延長到三年，有一天鄰家的野貓爬上柱子打開了一個鳥籠，那個鳥在籠子里飛撲了一陣就仆到地上，它祇能在貓的前面跳着逃，不能把自己的身體飛上天空去，終於死在貓的爪牙下。</p>
<p>父親知道了把家里的僕人都責罵一頓。大哥很早就歸睡，父親以爲死了一個鳥大哥心里不樂意，但是第二天早上大哥偸偸地把所養的鳥都放出了籠子，對於他那種舉動誰都不敢動問，彷彿有大禍要降臨的樣子。</p>
<p>在吃中飯的桌上，大哥見父親整半天沒有展過眉，很內愧地說：</p>
<p>「它們在籠子里關得太久了，已不知道它們的兩個翅膀是可以展開來飛上天去的，我覺得這是我的罪惡……</p>
<p>大哥哭了。在幾天之後，他又飄了出去，至今沒有音訊……</p>
<h3>牛鼻子　决不屈服</h3>
<p>— 黄堯</p>
<h3>死</h3>
<p>— 黑丁</p>
<p>冷鬱鬱的秋天。又是落着冷鬱鬱的雨。</p>
<p>我被旅途上的孤獨和寂寞的折磨，却終於懷着煩憂的心，沒有留變，便離開了那沙漠似的灰色的古城，而重回到那動亂不安的，已經半年沒有見面的瀋陽了。</p>
<p>然而，我沒有回家。我寄居在小河沿一個親戚那裏。</p>
<p>白天，我沒有一次會安靜的在他的房間裏坐些時候。我不知道我爲什麽要往外跑。因此，我不再呌着孤獨了。我更不再說着寂寞了。</p>
<p>一天，正是黃昏來臨了。一陣驟然的冷風，括來一塲凄濛的秋雨。</p>
<p>我從街上走回去。房間是異常的冷靜，一點聲音也沒有。只有窗外的雨打着玻璃窗發着沙沙的低微的碎響。這情况眞會讓我感到了陰冷與窒息的。我瞪了瞪眼睛。但是我的眼睛苦澀的，有如失掉了光芒。兩舖床是死一般的躺在地上。靠窗戶右邊的那一舖床上，有一個人蒙着被在躺臥着。但，在左邊的那一舖床上，坐着一個頭髮長長的，臉子被汚穢佔滿了，看去竟有好幾個月沒有洗一洗臉的人。他的上身披着一件似白不白，似黑不黑的骯髒的破布衫，左邊那一隻肩膀頭子露在外邊，而且發着烏靑。布衫有三個鈕扣脫掉了，能看見削瘦的胸脯浮着一層黑東西。他的下身是穿着一條深黑色的破褲子屁股上一個大洞；露着肉。他沒有穿襪子，他只是拖着一雙沒有脚後跟的不完整的破布鞋。他的脚像挿在炭灰裹染了染，糊黑糊黑地。他低着頭。他不敢明目張胆的看一看人。他沒有一點精神，那簡直和死人沒有什麽分別。他的全身筋肉都在抽動，手指頭軟軟地按着膝蓋。</p>
<p>我站在門旁，他們沒有看見我走進去。</p>
<p>突然，右邊的那舖床上躺臥着的那個人，從被子裹伸出頭來，我一看這是我的親戚。他暴躁地，生着氣，用手拍着床，駡聲的說：「你，你，你這東西，除了死再沒有別的路可走！你一次一次來擾亂我……………三天兩頭來要錢，錢要去，還偸我的衣服，今天若不是我進屋看見，這副眼鏡又要被你偸走了。你，你，你再來，我就送你到衙門裏去吃官司。快滾，快滾……」</p>
<p>一邊這麽說，一邊爬起身來。</p>
<p>這時，我才看淸楚坐在左邊床上的那個被駡的人，原來也是我的親戚。他是我那個親戚的叔弟。他被駡得幾乎要哭了。他在嘴裏只是：「我，我這回眞要學好，你給我幾個錢戒烟吧……」</p>
<h3>平定堡之春</h3>
<p>— 庫克巴桑</p>
<p>節季到了春天，寒冷依然在燃燒着蒙古大平原。太陽雖然按着時刻升降，但山陰的白茫茫的積雪一絲陽光也見不到。河流漸漸地融解了，冰塊在太陽的監視下，不知不覺的在水流中消散啦。黑夜白天都不斷的有風沙襲擊平原，襲擊村落，襲擊牛羊和駱駝。</p>
<p>已經是四月里的天氣了在平定堡聞不到一點兒春的氣息。</p>
<p>平定堡這地方有無數人對牠起一種敬愛，那是在幾年前曾經在這里發生過英勇的戰爭，雖說失敗者慘遭了滅亡，百姓們却永遠不忘記他們的遺留在人間的英勇的精神。</p>
<p>在蒙古大平原的遙遠的盡頭，從地平綫上凸出一道丘陵，彷彿大海中突出的島嶼，那不是蒙古包的排列，不是喇嘛廟宇，而是遭受過兵荒馬亂的的平定堡。</p>
<p>一條鴻溝將平定堡隔開，這在盤古開天關地時溝還沒有誕生，夏禹王治水時也沒有留在這兒挖一道溝，而牠是最近的世紀，上帝驅使他的選民挖掘的。從遙遠的盡頭挖掘到邀遠的盡頭，把整個平原切開，正如天上的銀河一樣。奇怪極啦！在平定堡這兒，上帝是特別愛發旨意，神父强迫繳不出地租的人的女兒到敎堂里去當童貞女，收賣奴隸，對於人民的一切壓迫，神父總說「都是上帝的旨意。」</p>
<p>作爲聖蹟被保留在人間的鴻溝，如其說是堡與堡之間的界綫，母寗說牠是人與人之間的隔核。</p>
<p>在南堡，隨時隨地都飄揚着惡濁的馬糞的臭味，破落的房屋，給飢寒磨難着的農民，牲口羣，一切都在骯髒里戰抖着。不論什麽時候，農民們觸眼到北堡的敎堂塔頂上的金十字架，臉上的愁苦便顯露出來，誰的心頭都會湧出一陣辛酸。</p>
<p>風沙刮過金十字架，刮過貧民窟，然而春天是不憐憫窮人的！給飢餓激怒的人們，會暗暗的咒駡那十字架，咒駡吃人的惡徒——神父，自己一年中血汗得來的糧食，通通給他們拿去，不牽去牲口還說是上帝特賜的恩惠「特賜恩惠」！</p>
<p>當太陽從地平綫上升起，把最初的光芒射到金十字架上的時候，洪亮的鐘聲就悠揚的由塔巓傳送出來，迅速的拋通平定堡，拋進每個敎徒的耳朶里，默然無聲，大家不約而同的低下了頭，跪倒虔誠的開始向聖主祈禱。接着可以聽到童貞女的頌主歌聲，悠悠揚揚，調子里夾雜着悲悽，但是落到祈禱者心上，却永遠是溫順的柔和的。</p>
<p>氣候一天一天的暖和起來，農民們爲了肚子不得不到敎堂里去租地。</p>
<p>神父們老是溢笑滿面，幸福在他們身上開出美麗的花朵。上帝賜給他們超越一切的智慧，他們運用智慧來宰割這整個平定堡。無論農民怎樣哀求减租，他門總是慈悲的給農民解說敎堂的苦處，而且他們立刻跪到聖像前替農民做祈禱：</p>
<p>——主啊！饒恕他們，賜福他們吧！</p>
<p>有一天一個佈吿貼出來，說是不准種高梁，不准包米，簡直除了鴉片之外，任什麽都不准種！可是吃什麽糧食過日子呢？上帝也不會知道吧？黃頭髮黃眼睛的神父們也說話？「到秋天一定要租糧！」地主要收糧食，別人又呌種鴉片。</p>
<p>風沙不斷的侵凌平定堡，敎徒們不斷的祈禱，農民們不斷的到敎堂去租地。在這蒙古大平原的盡處，只有春風和神父是頂愜意的了。</p>

<p>可是，她回到上海之後，一切努力都在白森卿暗中破壞之下而毫無辦法，她窮困了，窘迫了，經濟來源完全斷了。在這個關頭，白森卿只輕輕用了一些詭計，梅蘿香便不得不含着眼淚再回到他的懷裏去了。人總是檢最容易的路走的，何况現在社會中一個意志薄弱的女子呢！</p>

<h3>Yesterday Chairman Chiang Arrived in Nanjing: A 28-Day Inspection Tour Through Six Provinces; Impressions of Inspecting Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou</h3>
<p>Local administration has generally made considerable progress; a common shortcoming is impractical work and disorganization.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang, traveling from Jiujiang on the Yong Sui warship, arrived at Wuhu at 8:30 AM on the 5th. He then transferred to a car and arrived in Nanjing at 10:30 AM. He will preside over the ten-province department head and commissioner conference to be convened by the Executive Yuan on the 10th. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang, whose military and political inspection tour of various provinces will soon be a month long, left Xun at 5:00 PM on the 4th, accompanied by Qian Dajun, director of the First Bureau of the Adjutant's Office, Chen Bulei, director of the Second Bureau, secretaries, and guards, heading east on the Yong Sui warship. He arrived at Wuhu at 8:45 AM on the 5th, transferring to a car and arriving safely in the capital at 11:00 AM. Chairman Chiang departed from Nanjing on the Yi Xian warship on April 8th, heading west. He arrived in Hankou at 4:00 PM on the 10th. At 4:00 PM on the 12th, he flew from Hankou to Yichang. On the 13th, he boarded the Minsheng steamer heading west, disembarking along the way at scenic spots such as Wushan, Kuifu, and Wanxian for sightseeing. He arrived in Chongqing at 3:40 PM on the 16th. The next afternoon at 3:00 PM, he flew to Chengdu. In addition to inquiring about the military and political situation in Sichuan and summoning generals, gentry, and local leaders for talks, he presided over the opening ceremony of the Chengdu branch of the military academy on the 18th. At 9:30 AM on the 22nd, he flew to Kunming. At 10:00 AM on the 25th, he flew to Yunnan. At 4:00 PM on the 27th, he flew to Hunan. At 11:00 AM on the 29th, he flew to Jiangxi, staying until now. In total, this trip lasted 28 days, passing through the six provinces of Hubei, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Jiangxi. In addition to inspecting the military and political affairs of the provinces, he gave many instructions. It can truly be said that he had no time to warm his seat and worked hard. It is reported that Chairman Chiang will not travel elsewhere after arriving in Nanjing. He will personally preside over the ten-province department head and commissioner conference to be convened by the Executive Yuan on the 10th. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Chen Bulei, Qian Dajun, and accompanying personnel, passed Xun heading east at 5:00 PM on the 4th. Xiong Shihui returned to the province at 4:00 PM on the 4th. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Wuhu) Chairman Chiang arrived at Wuhu at 8:30 AM on the 5th aboard the Yong Sui warship from Xun, with the Yi Xian warship escorting. Chairman Chiang immediately disembarked and transferred to a car sent by the Military Affairs Commission, touring Wuhu for a week. At 9:00 AM, he returned to Nanjing via the Nanjing-Wuhu Road. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Wuhu) Chairman Chiang arrived at Wuhu at 8:30 AM on the 5th aboard the Yong Sui warship from Xun. He then disembarked at the customs wharf, met with Xu Huizhi, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and others, inquiring about the construction of Wuhu and the security of southern Anhui. At 9:00 AM, he boarded a car sent by the Military Affairs Commission, inspected the urban area for a week, and then returned to Nanjing via the Nanjing-Wuhu Highway. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang returned to Nanjing on the 5th and issued the following impressions of his inspection of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces:</p>
<p>The Best Results are from Anti-Opium Efforts</p>
<p>The main purpose of this trip was to inspect the three provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. Since I had been away from Sichuan for more than half a year, and had not visited Yunnan and Guizhou for nearly a year, I was eager to understand the actual implementation of policies in the three provinces. Therefore, I stayed in these three provinces for a longer time. From my inspection, I found that the most significant progress in the politics of the three provinces was the anti-opium campaign. Whether it was banning cultivation or banning smoking, both were done quickly and effectively. Not only was it done according to the scheduled timeframe, but it even exceeded the original schedule. Many people were able to quit smoking voluntarily. Yunnan Province's investigation of civil servants was considered serious. The chairmen of the three provinces also made great efforts to ban cultivation. As a result of converting to grain cultivation, food production has significantly increased compared to before. This is why the Red bandits decided to flee to Yunnan, and the people rarely fled, which is due to the abundance of grain storage. The most striking impression is that the people I saw no longer had the haggard and worried faces of the past. This is most gratifying.</p>
<p>Rapid Progress in Transportation Construction</p>
<p>Another major achievement is the rapid progress in transportation construction. The completed and open highways include the Sichuan-Shaanxi Road (Chengdu to Xi'an, 1,174 kilometers long), the Sichuan-Guizhou Road (Chongqing to Guiyang section, 551 kilometers), and the Hunan-Guizhou Road (1,016 kilometers). The Sichuan-Guizhou Road is the most well-maintained. The Hunan-Guizhou Road was the most difficult to construct due to passing through mountainous areas, but it was also completed on schedule according to the timetable set by the Xingying (Provisional Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission). The Guizhou-Yunnan Road (Guiyang to Kunming, 622 kilometers) is also progressing rapidly and will be completed this month. These four major highways, connecting five provinces and totaling more than 3,300 li, were all built in the past year. After the Guizhou-Yunnan Road is open to traffic, one can travel directly from Nanjing to Kunming by car, which will greatly advance transportation. This is all due to the practical efforts of the governments and people of these provinces. The above two points are most satisfying.</p>
<p>Selection of County Magistrates Needs Urgent Screening</p>
<p>As for the general politics of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, there has also been considerable progress in general. However, there are still many areas that need to be improved. The selection of county magistrates urgently needs attention and screening. Among the current county magistrates, there are still some who are old, weak, mediocre, and inferior, and they must be replaced. In terms of education, public health, and livelihood, in the area of education, the quantity has increased compared to before, but the handling of affairs has not yet reached the expected level of hope. In the area of public health, social order has become more stable than before, but the baojia (local security system) teams and mass training have not yet shown real results, and they have not been able to develop the power of self-government and self-defense based on the principle of "governing the people by the people." The most lacking aspect is livelihood. The counties have done little to open up land and water conservancy, plant forests and dredge rivers, increase production, and develop the national economy. Some have not even paid attention to it. This is indeed due to the depletion of local economies and the lack of funds, which creates practical difficulties. However, if local officials can be sincere and pay attention to this matter, it is not entirely impossible.</p>
<p>Labor Service Must Strive for Popularity</p>
<p>There are also counties that have earnestly carried out labor service, achieving considerable results, but these are extremely few and must be popularized. As for compulsory labor, although there have been considerable results, there is one most common shortcoming: those conscripted are all poor people, while those with more assets and status, such as teachers, students, and local gentry, do not set an example and actively participate. This kind of unequal phenomenon is far from my original intention in advocating compulsory labor. The provinces should try to correct this shortcoming and improve it practically. I hope that intellectuals and those with assets and status in the locality will actively participate and benefit the locality.</p>
<p>Sanitation Facilities are Extremely Lacking</p>
<p>Secondly, sanitation facilities in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces are extremely lacking. In some counties in Yunnan and Guizhou, there are even counties without a single pharmacy. I believe that only by passively providing the people with places to treat diseases can we actively improve their health and physique. This is most related to the livelihood aspect of education, public health, and livelihood. I hope that all localities will strive to correct this.</p>
<p>Management and Control Need More Attention</p>
<p>As for general local administration, considerable progress has been made in various places. However, the most common shortcomings are: first, impracticality. In other words, although efforts are made, they are not effective. Second, the various tasks are scattered and not connected, so they cannot achieve overall results. This is due to a lack of knowledge of how to make efforts. Therefore, I believe that in addition to education, public health, and livelihood, more attention must be paid to management. Whether it is education, public health, or livelihood, management and control cannot be ignored. The so-called management is what must be paid attention to: checking, supervising, urging, comprehensively examining the name and reality, rewarding and punishing according to merit. Emphasis must be placed on order and discipline. The so-called control is comprehensive planning, distinguishing between urgency and order, and paying attention to the close connection of various tasks. Do not let them be scattered and undisciplined, each doing its own thing, so that efforts are equal to being wasted. This is what those in charge of political affairs in various places, such as commissioners and county magistrates, must pay attention to. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>TASHIRO to Take Office Sooner</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Tashiro, the commander of the Japanese North China Garrison, will return to his country around the 24th due to the strengthening of the garrison, and Muta will come to take office in his place around the 20th. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Muta, whose term to return to his country and take up a new post is near, is scheduled to go to Beiping at 9:00 AM on the 7th. In the morning, he will review the provincial garrison troops, and in the afternoon, he will visit various important Chinese figures to say goodbye. In the evening, he will host a banquet for various circles in Beiping at the military attache's office in Beiping. On the 8th, he will visit the military attaches of British, American, and other countries to say goodbye. At noon, he will go to Tongxian to meet Yin Rugeng, and also review the troops, exchanging opinions on the Jidong issue. In the evening, he will return to Tianjin, staying briefly before going to the Beining Railway line to inspect troops in Yu, Qin, and Tang Ao. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese army in North China is strengthening its forces. In addition to increasing the number of military police in Beiping and Tianjin, it will also strengthen the capabilities of its special service agencies and implement the plan sooner. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Principle of Canceling the Jidong Puppet Organization Has Not Been Fully Decided</h3>
<p>Beiping: Chen Zhongfu returned to Beiping from Tianjin this afternoon and said that he would return to Beiping to preside over the regular meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee on the 6th, and will visit Song Shi again to continue discussions on the Hebei-Chahar diplomatic issues. The issue of canceling the Jidong organization was discussed in Tianjin, but the principle has not yet been fully decided. It is hoped that it can be realized in the short term. Because the suppression of communists in Shanxi Province has been smooth and the Hebei-Chahar region has been carefully deployed, there is no need to discuss the anti-communist issue. Song will return to Beiping within a few days. The Office of the Special Diplomatic Commissioner of Hebei and Chahar is under the control of the Foreign Affairs Committee, which is to unify authority and is not to break away from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The special commissioner Luo Jiaheng will return to Beiping soon. It is said that Luo resigned from his position as special commissioner because he could not bear the heavy workload and telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to request his resignation. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Before going to Beiping on the 5th, Chen Juesheng said that the construction plan for the Cangshi Road is under study. It has not yet been decided whether the funds for the road will be studied as the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang or the Gushishijiazhuang line. Regarding the Hebei-Chahar issue, the principle of abolishing the puppet organization has been decided. As for the general issues of Hebei and Chahar, the situation has been improving in recent days and will be decided after further discussions. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese side stated that the Hebei-Jidong diplomatic issue will be determined after Muta meets with Yin Rugeng on the 8th and returns to Tianjin. Chen Zhongfu, Chen Juesheng, and Pan Yugui went to Beiping one after another on the 5th and will carry out activities from the sidelines. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Chen Zhongfu returned to Beiping from Tianjin at 11:30 AM on the 5th. According to reports, as a result of the talks with the Japanese side in Tianjin, it has been decided to abolish the Jidong puppet organization. It can be realized after the follow-up issues are negotiated. The anti-communist affairs of Hebei and Chahar were also discussed, but the bandits in Jin have no power to counterattack. At the same time, the Hebei and Chahar authorities have a strict deployment. Before the communists enter Hebei and Chahar, there is no need for discussion. Committee Chairman Song will return to Beiping within days and will continue to discuss the general issues of Hebei and Chahar with Matsumuro in Beiping. Luo Jiaheng, the special commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Hebei and Chahar, is still in Tianjin and will return to Beiping within days. I am coming to Beiping to preside over the regular meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee on the 6th. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Chen Juesheng said, first, the Communications Committee is preparing to be established in the short term; second, the question of where the funds for the Cangshi Road will be raised is being sought, but it has not yet been determined whether to build the Cangshi Road or the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang or Shigu Road; third, the principles for the Jidong issue have been determined, and Xiao Zhenying and Chen Zhongfu are responsible for it. Only the technical procedures remain to be studied. After meeting with Matsumuro for further discussions, diplomacy has a better trend recently, and North China can gradually become stable; fourth, Li Ziros came north, but I have not met him, and there is no loan negotiation for road construction. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: It is said that Luo Jiaheng will be transferred (5th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Martial Law Implemented in Shantou</h3>
<p>(Shantou) After the Japanese patrol fleet arrived here, the Japanese consul also demanded a resolution of the Kakuda case in January. Kakuda was a police officer at the Japanese consulate. The Japanese consul claimed that he was killed by Chinese, but the Shantou authorities have always said that Kakuda died of a stroke and was not killed by Chinese, so they refused to pay the 10,000 yuan compensation requested by the Japanese consul. Negotiations have therefore stalled. Although the authorities have issued a notice stating that the fleet's arrival in Shantou has nothing to do with this case, there are still rumors that the Japanese fleet may take action. Last night, local military and police authorities implemented martial law. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>3,000 Tons of Smuggled Goods Shipped to Tianjin in Two Days</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 4th and 5th, smuggled sugar and rayon were transported to Tianjin from Nandasi Liushouying Beidaihe Changli in eastern Luannan on two trains, totaling about 3,000 tons, all unloaded at the East Station and transported to a certain concession. The Jinpu West Station is strictly guarded, and only six or seven reporters inspect each day. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Southern Hebei: Spring Work on the Grand Canal Begins</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Spring work on the Grand Canal in southern Hebei began on the 5th. The funds of more than 16,000 yuan have been allocated by the provincial government. Li Baoshu, director of the River Affairs Bureau, returned to Tianjin after inspecting the coast on the 5th. It is said that the embankments along the coast are in disrepair and extremely dangerous. During the spring work, they will be thickened separately. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Gansu Province: The Disaster Situation in Hexi is Urgent</h3>
<p>Yu Xuezhong telegraphed to request funds for relief</p>
<p>(Lanzhou) The disaster situation in Hexi, Jiuquan, Zhangye, Anxi, Yumen, and Dunhuang is becoming more and more urgent. The county magistrates have recently telegraphed Lanzhou to report that the disaster victims are forced by hunger and have gathered to loot food. Yu Xuezhong yesterday telegraphed President Chiang and Zhu, chairman of the Relief Commission, again, asking them to quickly allocate huge funds to provide relief, and said that the counties in Hexi have suffered disasters repeatedly, which is unusual. If no plans are made early, hundreds of thousands of lives will be wiped out. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>A Perspective on the German-Manchukuo Agreement</h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>Since its arrival in Japan last winter, the Far East Economic Investigation Group led by Dr. Otto C. Kiep of Germany has been discussing with the Japanese government and public ways to promote German-Japanese-Manchukuo commercial cooperation. Later, the group went to Manchuria for inspection, and then went to Japan again to discuss the purchase of soybeans from Manchuria with the Japanese authorities. After repeated negotiations, news recently came that the group, representing Germany, signed a trade agreement with the puppet state in Tokyo on April 30. The content of the agreement stipulates that "75% of the value of goods exported from Manchukuo to Germany, such as soybeans and wool, shall be paid by Germany in foreign currency, and the remaining 25% shall be paid in marks. The quantity of goods exported from Germany to Manchukuo shall be limited to the amount of its imports and shall not exceed that amount."</p>
<p>Recently, the internal economic contradictions in Germany have become more and more serious, and food shortages have reached an extreme. The news in the newspapers these days about Göring and Schacht fighting each other is a clear proof of this. Therefore, the conclusion of this agreement is somewhat meaningful for Germany in balancing trade and easing internal economic contradictions. However, on the other hand, we cannot completely believe their semi-official report that "the nature of this agreement is only technical." In today's widespread rumors of a German-Japanese military alliance, we cannot ignore the serious political significance contained in the conclusion of the German-Manchukuo agreement.</p>
<p>We cannot help but suspect that the signing of this agreement was entirely initiated by the ambitious country, which wanted to increase its effectiveness in expanding in East Asia and wanted to win over Germany as a helper. Therefore, it was willing to allow Germany to benefit a little in Manchuria. Anyway, Manchuria has plenty of soybeans. Isn't it a good idea to exchange them for Krupp's cannons and planes?</p>
<p>As for Germany, its internal economic contradictions are becoming increasingly serious, and it urgently needs to develop outwards. In Central Europe, it has been blocked by countries such as the Little Entente, so it is natural for it to hope to be able to insert a foot in the raw material-rich Far East. Moreover, the contradictions between Germany and Japan have been relatively eased. Although there are some conflicts between Germany and Japan due to the relationship between the Pacific mandated territories, Germany has long expressed its willingness to wipe away these traces in order to win over Japan. When Hitler asked for the restoration of colonies in his speech, he did not first mention Japan's mandated territories, which, if not expressing his willingness to give them up, at least showed his intention to please Japan.</p>
<p>From the above, we can see that this German-Manchukuo agreement, concluded under the coordination of Germany and Japan, is nothing less than a powerful chain between Germany and Japan. Germany and Japan are two major vanguards standing on the same front, and the connection of this chain seems to make them more closely connected. Rumors of a German-Japanese military alliance have been around for a long time, and the conclusion of the German-Manchukuo agreement further confirms that these rumors are not "groundless."</p>
<h3>Central and National Government Hold Joint Memorial Ceremony for the Founding of the Revolutionary Government</h3>
<p>Chairman Lin Leads the Ceremony and Reports</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 5th, the anniversary of the founding of the revolutionary government, the Central and National Governments held a joint memorial ceremony in front of Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum at 8:00 AM.

At exactly 8:00 AM, the music was played and the ceremony was held. Chairman Lin of the National Government presided over the ceremony. After performing the ceremony in accordance with the order of the ceremony, Chairman Lin delivered a speech on the spot, saying that Premier Sun Yat-sen took office as President in Guangzhou on this day in the tenth year of the Republic of China because he realized that the northern authorities at that time were not only disloyal to the country, but also had betrayed it. Therefore, he resolutely took the position of President, intending to use his power to command the country to uphold the Republic and implement the revolutionary work. There were many difficulties in this process. Premier Sun was committed to the revolution and did not care about his personal position, but only sought the welfare of the people. In the early years of the Republic of China, the northern soldiers supported the Republic of China. In order to promote unity, he decided to cede his position. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, the situation was different, and the Republic of China was almost interrupted. Therefore, he held a spirit of great fearlessness, took on arduous tasks, overcame all difficulties, in order to unify and advance the revolution and maintain the foundation of the Republic of China. Today, when the country is in serious national crisis, we should follow Premier Sun's spirit of fearlessness, strive hard, so that the foundation of the country will be forever solid and the revolutionary cause will be successful, so that we will not fail to commemorate Premier Sun's assumption of the office of Extraordinary President today. After Chairman Lin finished his speech, the Central Committee members and the government committee members, and all special appointees, were led by the chairman in turn to the mausoleum. After returning to their positions, the ceremony was completed and the meeting adjourned. The committee members went down the mountain and entered the city together. The military academy students and teachers then asked Dean Dai to give a speech in front of the mausoleum before returning to school in formation. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Executive Yuan Orders the Relocation of the Mongolian Political Council</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan resolved that since the Mongolian League and Banner in Suiyuan have formed an Autonomous Political Affairs Committee, the Mongolian Autonomous Political Affairs Committee should no longer be located in Bailingmiao and should be moved to within Chahar Province. It has telegraphed the Chairman of the Executive Yuan, Zhang, Chairman of Chahar, Fu, Chairman of Suiyuan, the Director of the Taiyuan Cabinet, and Sa, Chairman of the Mongolian Political Council in Suiyuan, to inform them. This decision may be the reason why De Wang and others held a meeting in Bailingmiao without receiving this telegram. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan believes that since the Mongolian Political Council in Suiyuan has been established, the original Mongolian Political Council should no longer be located in Bailingmiao in that area. The Executive Yuan resolved last week that it should be moved into Chahar Province among the various leagues and banners, and a suitable location should be selected and reported to the central government for approval. It has recently been learned that the Executive Yuan has telegraphed the two Mongolian Political Councils, the Chairmen of Chahar and Suiyuan Provinces, and the Director of the Cabinet to inform them.

<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan has completed the compilation of civil affairs agenda items for the conference of department heads and commissioners. The public security and education groups are still being actively compiled. Here is a summary of the civil affairs agenda: Many provincial governments have reported joint office operations, but the actual situations vary. What are the benefits of joint office operations in various provinces? If there are difficulties, how should they be resolved? How should the current organization of provincial governments be further streamlined to comply with the original intent of joint office operations? How should the powers of administrative commissioners and provincial governments be determined? What are the advantages and disadvantages of administrative commissioners concurrently serving as county magistrates? How should the expenses of administrative commissioners' offices be appropriately regulated? Recently, many county governments have either abolished bureaus and changed them to sections, or merged bureaus and sections. What are the benefits of the reorganization? What are the advantages and disadvantages of establishing one combined construction and education section versus two separate sections in county governments? Is it sufficient to have only one school supervisor per county? Is it more appropriate for county magistrates to recommend county school supervisors for appointment, or for the education department to directly nominate them for appointment by the provincial government? Local finances, regarding various systems of revenue, expenditure, and custody, have been extremely chaotic in various provinces and counties. How has the implementation of the regulations for reorganizing county local finances, previously promulgated by the Executive Headquarters, been? For provinces that have not applied the above regulations, are there any relatively sound solutions? What is the recent status of establishing regional offices in various provinces? Regarding expenses, each province spends approximately one million annually. What are the actual revenue and expenditure figures for each province? If, due to financial constraints, most or all regional offices adopt a Class C staffing, will it affect the progress of regional administration? Should district chiefs avoid their native counties? Is it appropriate for district chiefs in locations where county governments are situated to be concurrently served by county government staff or designated police officers? What are the advantages and disadvantages of district chiefs avoiding their native places? Due to the large area and inconvenient transportation of counties, it is difficult to directly engage with the people. Can regional offices effectively supplement the shortcomings of county governments, especially in promoting new policies such as improving agricultural seeds, repairing rural roads, developing public education, promoting sanitation, and mediating disputes among the people? Can regional offices assume practical responsibility? Are there any abuses in the application of the Violation of Public Order Punishment Law by regional offices to villagers? What is the progress of grain storage in various provinces? What are the most convenient methods for constructing granaries, accumulating grain, and managing storage? How should self-government and the baojia system be adjusted? (Central News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Italian Parliament Meets to Celebrate Victory of Aggression</h3>
<p>"The Abyssinian Emperor Has Fled!" Echoes Through the Entire Chamber</p>
<p>(Rome) When the Italian army was approaching the gates of Addis Ababa, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini still ordered a test of public mobilization. Mussolini announced this decision in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday afternoon. The chamber was packed with people, all dressed in black shirts, singing Fascist songs. The diplomatic corps, senior military officers from the army, navy, and air force were also in attendance. Count Ciano (father of the former Italian ambassador to China and current Minister of Propaganda Ciano) gave the opening speech. His first words were, "The Abyssinian Emperor has fled!" Upon hearing this, the entire chamber cheered, shaking the roof. The parliament then announced a one-hour recess to express joy over the turning point in the Abyssinian war. When they reconvened, everyone expected the Prime Minister to make an important speech, but instead, he announced plans to hold a test of Italian public mobilization, during which he would address the nation. According to official sources, this event will take place in the near future, possibly on Tuesday or Wednesday. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The current session of the Chamber of Deputies began today. At 4 PM, Prime Minister Mussolini personally attended and delivered the opening address. All members of parliament wore black shirts, and the scene of them singing Fascist party songs when the Prime Minister arrived was unprecedented. The Prime Minister said in his speech, "I have ordered the people of the whole country to prepare for a general mobilization of citizens. At that time, I will present an important message, which you have all been eagerly awaiting." Subsequently, Chamber of Deputies Speaker Count Ciano said, "The League of Nations has provided both spiritual and material assistance to the Abyssinian Emperor and implemented sanctions to resist Fascism. However, Italy was still able to completely defeat the Abyssinian army within several months. This victory is unprecedented. Without the Prime Minister's great talent, how could it have been achieved? The Italian people, grateful for the source of their blessings, hereby express their admiration for the Prime Minister." (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to political sources, the Italian army's occupation of Addis Ababa will be announced to the public on Wednesday (May 6).

At that time, sirens and bells will ring together, and all citizens will gather at designated locations to listen to Prime Minister Mussolini's broadcast speech. Fascist party soldiers will all wear uniforms, all stores will close, all buildings will fly national flags, and torches will be lit on the mountains. All celebration programs will be broadcast in four languages by radio to various locations. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Meets with British and French Ambassadors</h3>
<p>British King Receives Foreign Envoys; Abyssinian Minister Does Not Participate</p>
<p>(Rome) British Ambassador to Italy Drummond and Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Suvich held a long talk today, which is considered very important by political circles here. According to reliable sources, the entire Abyssinian issue was discussed during the conversation.

<h3>A Heartwarming Tale Amidst the Flames of War in Addis Ababa</h3>
<p>British Reporter Marries Spanish Female Reporter</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: Amidst the terror here, there is a heartwarming tale worth recording. Steele, a reporter from the London Times, and Ms. Halero, a Spanish female reporter, were assigned to come here to gather news. They met in a foreign land, fell in love at first sight, and after their engagement, they had to hold a ceremony. Today, they quietly got married in the British embassy. At that time, the sound of gunfire could be clearly heard outside, and hundreds of foreign expatriates were crouching and taking refuge in the embassy, unable to eat or sleep. However, the honeymoon travel range of this new couple had to be limited. At this moment, the two of them either strolled arm in arm in the embassy garden full of barbed wire or went to the refugee settlement to visit the evacuees, which slightly spoils the scenery.

<h3>Italian Army Enters the Capital of Abyssinia</h3>
<p>Abyssinia's Last Resistance Collapses; Southern Route Generals Flee to Djibouti</p>

<p>Addis Ababa: The Italian army entered the city this afternoon. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian Army Headquarters reported today that the Italian army has made the final preparations for occupying Addis Ababa. Aircraft have flown over Addis Ababa to scout the situation. It is said that Commander-in-Chief Badoglio plans to personally lead his troops, along with Colonial Minister Lesona and Rome Governor Bottai, to enter the capital of Abyssinia. (National Telegraph, 5th)</p>
<p>(Rome) General Badoglio, Senior Commissioner of Italian East Africa and Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force, issued a communiqué stating that the vanguard of the Mitohu Motorized Column, belonging to the Blackshirt Zapotiya Division, has arrived in the vicinity of Addis Ababa. As soon as the main force of the motorized column arrives, it will occupy Addis Ababa. It is noted that this column is composed entirely of white soldiers. The Italian Army Headquarters apparently does not want to send black native soldiers into Addis Ababa. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is rumored that the first to enter Addis Ababa will be the troops belonging to the Zapotiya Division. The motorized units and native soldier units of this division have set out from Taishi City at the same time and are advancing separately. The native soldiers arrived near Addis Ababa a few days ago and have now joined up with the motorized units. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian army is now gathered on the outskirts of Addis Ababa and is being reorganized according to the plan for small teams representing various parts of the Italian army to enter the city. It is expected that the Zappada Division will be the first to enter the city. East African Italian Army Commander Badoglio claims that white Italian soldiers should be the first to enter the city. However, only troops of the Italian African native army arrived near Addis Ababa yesterday. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Djibouti: Abyssinia's final resistance to the Italian army collapsed today. Southern Route generals have abandoned Harar and Jijiga. General Nasibu and his Turkish military advisor Veshb Pasha and staff have arrived here and will take the British ship "Adventure" to Palestine with the Abyssinian Emperor. (National News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Djibouti: Abyssinian Southern Route Commander-in-Chief General Hosipu, along with former front-line commander General Makonong, Turkish military advisor General Veshibei, and many chieftains, arrived here last night by train from Diridahwa.

A Reuters reporter in Djibouti also wired that Abyssinian General Nassibo and Turkish advisor General Veshibei have arrived in Djibouti from Diridahwa. This indicates that the last organized resistance of the Abyssinian army has failed. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>British Government Admits Failure of Collective Action</h3>
<p>Considers Amending the League of Nations Covenant; Deems the Italian-Abyssinian Case a Great Disgrace</p>
<p>(London) British Prime Minister Baldwin and Foreign Secretary Eden, in response to a petition from the League of Nations Comrades Association for adopting more effective methods to restrain Italy, stated that the British government, in view of the failure of collective action in the Italian-Abyssinian war, must clarify the position of the League of Nations. The issue of amending the League of Nations Covenant requires very careful consideration. (Reuters Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin and Foreign Secretary Eden today pledged to consider amending the League of Nations Covenant regarding its failure to prevent the Italian-Abyssinian war. This promise was made to a delegation from the British League of Nations Comrades Association. The delegation stated that British public opinion is deeply saddened by the League of Nations' failure to rescue Abyssinia from the horrors of war. If the League of Nations fails to impose economic pressure on Italy to prevent it from enjoying the benefits of illegal warfare, it is questionable whether the British people will be prepared to provide assistance to other League of Nations member states when they are invaded in the future. (National Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) According to Oxford University Greek Professor and Chairman of the League of Nations Association Professor Murray, Prime Minister Baldwin, in addressing the League of Nations Association's representatives, deemed it a great disgrace that the League of Nations could not save Abyssinia. The professor said in a speech at a meeting in Oxford today, "I find it extremely difficult to find words to express our feelings about this tragedy. It is all due to the failure to respond to the Prime Minister's call. I feel that my saying that the Prime Minister called it a great disgrace is not an overstatement." (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet, during its meeting this morning, discussed the issue of the Abyssinian Emperor's flight and decided on the steps that the British government should take regarding this matter. However, the Cabinet meeting today did not consider in detail what attitude Britain will take on the Italian-Abyssinian issue when the League of Nations Council meets on the 11th of this month. According to semi-official sources, since the sanctions have proven to be a failure, Britain does not intend to adhere to the sanctions policy in the future. Regarding this, political sources said that Foreign Secretary Eden, in a speech at a Conservative Association banquet in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, last Saturday, said, "In the past seven months, we should listen respectfully to all kinds of lessons with a pragmatic spirit and use them as a guiding light for our actions. Our foreign policy is based on maintaining peace as a prerequisite. This goal will never change. We must do our best to persevere to the end." Eden's words may have hinted at the trend of Britain's future foreign policy, but this policy will certainly arouse opposition from some quarters, among which the opposition from supporters of the League of Nations Union will be intense. The road ahead seems to be full of thorns. Some political figures also said that the League of Nations Covenant must be reformed in the future. However, it is still unknown at this time whether the path of reform will limit the obligations arising from the League of Nations or limit the scope of action of the League of Nations itself.

<h3>Large Parts of Addis Ababa Burned Down; Most Residents Hang White Flags</h3>
<p>Italian Planes Soar Through the Sky; Foreign Nationals Flee for Refuge</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: Large parts of the city have been burned down, and smoke is still rising everywhere. People in the capital are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Italian army. It is heard that the Italian army does not want to bear the name of occupying Addis Ababa by force and is now waiting for the Addis Ababa delegation to hand over the capital to the Italian army. Italian planes have been soaring over Addis Ababa and the surrounding skies all day yesterday and have not encountered any resistance. As the Italian army is expected to arrive soon, many residents in the city have hung white flags to show their submission. Furthermore, one Englishman was injured and two Abyssinian women were killed by bandits. Last night, when a British rescue team was protecting Europeans leaving dangerous areas, bandits opened fire. A British priest suffered minor leg injuries, and two Abyssinian women in the same truck were shot and killed. It was very strange that only one Italian plane appeared in the sky over Addis Ababa on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. It is rumored that the Italian planes were absent during these three days to allow bandits to loot and plunder at will. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Djibouti: According to the latest news from the capital of Abyssinia, the French embassy has taken in about two thousand foreign nationals and refugees. Since the night before yesterday, it has been surrounded by rioters and is currently lacking food. French Minister Bota has requested assistance from the Governor of Somaliland. The local authorities have dispatched Senegalese soldiers with food and ammunition to Addis Ababa and all major railway stations along the route. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the news received last night, several French nationals still staying in Addis Ababa have fled to the French embassy outside the city. General Hairu, the governor of the Gujian province in northwestern Abyssinia, has arrived in Addis Ababa with 150 soldiers. These soldiers are well-armed and disciplined. All European nationals hope that they can effectively suppress the rioters. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Aguo Emperor's Moving Departure</h3>
<p>French Civil and Military Officials Pay Respects</p>
<p>(London) According to a late dispatch from Djibouti, the Aguo Emperor boarded a British warship yesterday afternoon in Djibouti, bound for Haifa, Palestine. He was accompanied by seventeen people. When the Emperor received several Aguo people and bid farewell to several Swedish military officers, the scene was extremely touching. Key Aguo generals such as General Gizetaw and General Gaza were seated in the governor's mansion's reception room. The Empress and her children remained in a separate room. When the Emperor left the governor's mansion, he descended the stairs alongside the Empress, with the children following behind. General Gaza and others stood divided on the left and right. As the Emperor and Empress passed before them, they bowed deeply to the ground. At that moment, everyone was silent, a scene of utter desolation. Suddenly, the sound of military horns broke the silence as the King and Queen entered the waiting car under the gaze of the crowd. Having arrived at the pier, they transferred to a small boat and boarded the British cruiser "Adventure."

Civil and military officials, all in uniform, were prepared to bid farewell. Between 5:00 PM and 5:25 PM, many Aguo and Swedish military officers visited the Emperor to bid him farewell. The Empress and her children remained inside, not appearing. Prominent Aguo generals General Gaza, General Gaedashu, and many other chieftains sat in the reception room, dispirited and silent. At 5:25 PM, two British naval officers entered the mansion to inform the Emperor that the cruiser "Adventure" was ready to sail. Thereupon, the Emperor and Empress, accompanied by their children, slowly descended the stairs, boarded the car, and departed. Aguo generals lined up on both sides, their faces filled with sorrow, offering their final respects to the Emperor. A large crowd braved the scorching sun, waiting for the royal carriage, hoping to catch a glimpse of his countenance. The scene at the time was extremely solemn. Before long, the car arrived at the pier. After the Emperor and his party alighted from the car, they immediately boarded a motorboat and transferred to the "Adventure," setting sail.

<h3>US Embassy in Aguo Capital Nearly Looted by Mob</h3>

<p>US Government Orders Abandonment of Embassy in Aguo</p>
<p>(Washington) The American Legation in Aguo was surrounded by a mob in the Aguo capital. The American Chargé d'Affaires, Anget, and his wife, along with six staff members, were trapped inside. They exchanged fire with the mob. The current Prime Minister, Herbar, has instructed the abandonment of the American Legation in the Aguo capital. American Chargé d'Affaires Anget sent a wireless message from the Aguo capital to Washington, reporting in detail the several attacks on the legation and how they were resisted. He said that they were fortunate to have loyal and courageous local servants, such as the cook, who were able to repel the robbers. When the mob first attacked, the servants rushed to the legation gate with pistols and swords to defend it, confronting the enemy. Other personnel in the legation also assisted with pistols and shotguns. The mob initially thought the legation was empty. Upon seeing the large number of defenders, they were greatly disappointed. The mob then opened fire on the back door. Mrs. Anget and Spencer, the American advisor to the Aguo government, were in the backyard and were nearly hit. In the afternoon, the situation eased slightly, but the mob's arrogance was still intense. Traffic in the streets was blocked, and the American Legation could not communicate with the British Legation, making it impossible to ask for help. Therefore, they requested London to send a wireless message to the British Legation in the Aguo capital, urging them to provide assistance. (Reuters, 5th)</p>

After being besieged twice, the American minister Anget and his wife and six members left the embassy safely this afternoon.

Dr. Junod, a representative of the International Red Cross, was surrounded in a house behind a burnt-down hotel for 36 hours. He has now sent someone to the British embassy for help. British rescue team member Meilai, Ph.D., was seriously injured during the first day of the riots in Aguo, and his condition has not improved. Several Russians from the British embassy were attacked while going to a grocery store opened by British Indian Muhammad Ali to collect food, and hid in the store. They only returned to the British embassy after the mob dispersed. The only grocery store in Aguo that was not disturbed was the one set up by this British Indian. Aguo is a little quieter today than yesterday. Many Aguo people are leaving the capital to the south with the things they looted, while some armed people are heading north, saying they will prevent Italian soldiers from entering the city. There is still no sign of Italian soldiers. People believe they are preparing a grand entry ceremony. The number of people seeking refuge in the British embassy is increasing day by day, and their food supply is sufficient to last for a long time. (Reuters, 5th)</p>

<h3>German Pseudo-Commercial Agreement: Statement Released in Berlin</h3>
<p>Purely Technical in Nature, No Political Background</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the recently signed commercial agreement between the German Foreign Exchange Bureau and Manchuria, inquiries have been frequently received regarding its content and nature. Therefore, the authorities today issued the following announcement:</p>
<p>"The purpose of this agreement is to adjust the payments between German and Manchurian trade, in order to increase the volume of imports and exports between the two sides through compensation methods. This agreement stipulates that both sides have the same obligations, and the amount of imported goods will be equal to the purchasing power. This agreement is necessary because Germany's foreign currency reserves were too low last year (due to a drop in export goods and repayment of foreign debts). Therefore, German soybean merchants had no choice but to reduce soybean imports, and the reduction was very serious, because it hindered the manufacture of butter, cream, etc., which endangered the living standards of the German people. However, under the new agreement, soybean imports from Manchuria can be increased to an amount equal to the amount of German goods exported to Manchuria. The benefit of this agreement is that the import and export merchants on both sides have the same obligations and the same benefits. This agreement is entirely technical in nature and has no political meaning or background." (Guomin News Agency dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<h3>Saito's Speech in the United States: Japan and Russia Will Not Go to War</h3>
<p>Both Currently Lack Offensive Forces; Economic Conflicts Between Japan and the United States Can Be Avoided</p>
<p>Baltimore, USA - Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Saito, gave a speech here today, claiming that Japan and Russia are unlikely to engage in war in Siberia at present, because both countries lack offensive forces there. Saito also said that the Japanese and "Manchu" troops currently on the Siberian border are insufficient for combat, and although incidents occur frequently on the border, the Japanese government is not taking any steps that can be considered preparations for war. Saito also firmly believes that the Soviet Russian government and people do not intend to fight Japan. In fact, Soviet Russia's military preparations are only to seek security, and not to attack others. As for the recent conflicts on the Siberian border, they are mostly due to unclear borders. If the two countries could simply send commissioners to demarcate the border, there would be no problem. Regarding the possibility of economic conflicts between Japan and the United States, Saito believes that there is nothing to worry about, because the recent report of the U.S. Tariff Commission states that only 8% of Japanese goods imported into the U.S. are competitive, and one-third of them are already controlled by protective measures.

<h3>South Manchuria Railway Raises Bonds</h3>
<p>43.6 Million Yuan to Implement Five-Year Reform Plan</p>
<p>(Dalian) The South Manchuria Railway Company is currently discussing raising 43.6 million Japanese yen to implement the railway's five-year improvement plan. Of this amount, 27 million yen will come from bonds issued to extend the financial year of 1935, and 13 million yen will come from bonds issued to extend the financial year of 1936. 3.6 million yen will be collected in 1937 from unpaid shares. The expenses are as follows: 10.2 million yen to build new routes, 16.5 million yen to improve existing routes and trains, 4 million yen for special projects within the South Manchuria Railway Company, 5.3 million yen to invest in subsidized companies, and 6.6 million yen for reserve funds. The economic activities that the South Manchuria Railway Company plans to operate in North China are not included in this. If the company decides to operate in North China, it will raise the funds for its application from other sources. (Reuters dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<h3>Discussion on the Anti-Communist Problem in Hebei and Chahar Reaches a Conclusion</h3>
<h3>No Concrete Measures for Negotiations in Eastern Hebei; The Future of the Chahar Incident Still Faces Many Difficulties</h3>
<p>Tianjin communication, Hebei-Chahar diplomacy: Since the closing of the meeting of Japanese military officers in Tianjin, the two sides have continued negotiations and have now reached a critical juncture. The Hebei-Chahar authorities are concentrating all their efforts to break through the current difficulties. All events agreed upon in Tianjin, those that have reached a conclusion are the anti-communist problem, those that are progressing are the abolition of the puppet organization in eastern Hebei, and those that are being prepared for negotiation are the Chahar incident. The situation is described as follows:</p>
<p>Anti-Communist Problem</p>
<p>The so-called anti-communism in Hebei and Chahar is the first requirement of the Japanese side. The so-called anti-communist agreement is a prerequisite for this matter. The two sides have had many resolutions on disputes. Although the text has been created, the authorities believe that the puppet organization in Hebei must be cancelled immediately before signing. The Japanese side believes that there must be factual evidence before continuing to discuss other issues. After repeated disputes, it was finally decided to first work on the content of the agreement, and the signing procedure will be completed after Song Zheyuan returns to Peiping.</p>
<p>Eastern Hebei Negotiations</p>
<p>Recently, Sino-Japanese negotiations have indeed made progress. This is because concrete measures for anti-communism have been partially realized, and it is inconvenient for the Japanese side to continue to evade. The Tokyo side had already agreed to the cancellation of the puppet organization in eastern Hebei when Yongjian returned home to ask for instructions. However, the Japanese military officers in general in North China felt that Yin Rugeng was working so hard and was so friendly that it would be pointless to cancel it suddenly, and there would be no way to reward the future and would discourage those who were friendly. Losing an Yin Rugeng is a small matter, but cutting off future generations is a big matter. In addition, Yin Rugeng has been working hard to survive and has received support from the Kwantung Army in Japan. It is quite difficult to cancel it suddenly. For this reason, the Japanese side is divided into three factions on this matter. The first faction advocates maintaining the existence of the puppet organization in eastern Hebei to avoid leaving loopholes and to discourage people like Yin Rugeng. The second faction advocates cancelling it immediately and merging with the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council, and monitoring its results. The third faction does not add to the division and advocates paying attention to the degree of development of the situation before making a decision. Seeing this, the authorities are working hard to eliminate the opinions of the first and third factions, to eliminate obstacles to progress, so as to achieve results more quickly. The current negotiations are probably at this important stage. It is heard that the Japanese side has slightly indicated that the puppet organization in eastern Hebei can be cancelled, but the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council and the puppet organization in eastern Hebei must "merge." In order for the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council to accommodate the puppet organization in eastern Hebei, it must be reorganized from the root, and the head must be changed drastically. Since Yin Rugeng's arrest warrant must be cancelled, his future position must not be lower than the current one. The key personnel in the puppet organization must also be placed. The two sides do not talk about who is "cancelling." The authorities believe that the word "merger" is equal to merging. Since it is called a merger, the cell functions of the puppet organization have not been lost. Doing so is almost recognizing the puppet organization as legitimate and dividing a seat for oneself, welcoming Yin Rugeng and his party to sit down. Therefore, they strongly disagree with this. They believe that there is still room for cancelling Yin's arrest warrant, and there is also room for discussing the future path. However, he must withdraw from the war zone and cannot change his appearance and still occupy his eastern Hebei. This is a principle that is difficult to insist on. Those who are currently researching also take this point as the center. However, Yin Rugeng still wants to continue the life of his puppet organization, and his activities are non-stop. The authorities progress one inch, and he also advances one inch, offsetting each other. The negotiation process is therefore delayed. Tada, the commander of the Japanese army stationed in North China, was transferred back to China, and the successor was Tashiro, a Chinese expert. If this issue is resolved before Tada leaves China, the result may be more amicable. If Tashiro takes office, his political views may affect diplomacy, and it is not known how things will turn out at that time.</p>
<p>Chahar Incident</p>
<p>In fact, the authorities have no power to negotiate with the Japanese side on this matter in Chahar. The two items of anti-communism and eastern Hebei are of constant concern to the authorities, and they are worried that they will not be able to cope with them. If the Chahar incident is also negotiated, and the two are mutually involved, it will be difficult to achieve the desired result. What the authorities recognize and slightly comfort themselves is that in diplomatic negotiations, the authority is unified, without losing power or humiliating the country, and without violating the central government's diplomatic intentions. As long as the other party is responsible, negotiations can proceed in an orderly manner. Before, Doihara came to China and handled North China diplomacy in the name of the head of the Shenyang Special Service Agency of the Japanese Kwantung Army, overstepping his authority, which caused jealousy among the Japanese military units stationed in Tianjin. The authorities were in a difficult situation under the dual diplomatic forces, and were exhausted in coping with them. Recently, Matsumuro, attached to the Japanese military unit stationed in North China, is stationed in Peiping all the time and is responsible for diplomatic negotiations. Contact is more convenient. Although the Chahar incident belongs to the scope of the Japanese Kwantung Army, if Matsumuro is willing to introduce a counterparty, the negotiations may be smooth. Only the situation in Chahar is more complicated than in eastern Hebei. The Japanese side is afraid that the communist bandits will sneak into the puppet-Manchukuo territory from the Sui-Chahar border, and has instigated De Wang's independence. Li Shouxin's puppet army has been changed to De Wang's jurisdiction. De Wang moved the Mongolian Political Council to Huade in northern Chahar, and the puppet organization will soon be realized. If this becomes a reality, future negotiations will be very difficult. Song Zheyuan personally has a close friendship with De Wang and is deeply aware that De Wang is on bad terms with the Shanxi and Suiyuan authorities because of this, and has not chosen a path under the pressure. He has already ordered Zhang Zizhong, the chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government, to send someone nearby to dissuade him. However, it is heard that De Wang is like an arrow on the string, waiting for an opportunity to launch. It is also feared that it is not possible to stop his attempts with words. (3rd)</p>
<h3>The Truth of Smuggling in North China Under Japanese Protection</h3>
<p>Private goods are openly unloaded and transported on the coast, creating a state of free trade, which is truly inconsistent with international morality.</p>
<p>Foreign News Agency Translation: Tianjin Correspondence from the North China Daily News:  A reporter recently went to Tianjin to conduct a detailed observation of the Jidong smuggling issue. The results obtained are listed below, from which the seriousness of this issue can be seen.</p>
<p>The reporter spoke with a businessman who had just returned to Tianjin from Beidaihe about smuggling. According to him, "I did not see any smuggling. What I saw were thirty-eight ships of various types moored in the Beidaihe bay, using many sampans to unload goods onto the shore. Their busy state was no less than that of the wharves on the Tianjin Bund when cargo traffic is heavy. You can no longer call this smuggling, because it is actually free trade. Judging from the current situation, Beidaihe is not only a free trade port, but even its coastal area is completely open."</p>
<p>In addition, there is one more thing worth noting. The reporter asked a Russian engaged in smuggling about the quantity of smuggled goods being transported and whether there were any restrictions. He replied, "There are no restrictions. Any goods you need can be transported in at any time, unless they are as bulky as elephants, which would be slightly difficult." In other words, a completely new economic situation has been created in the Jidong area, and it will soon become a free trade zone. All duty-free goods will begin to invade various parts of North China. The only limitation is the amount of transportation costs.</p>
<p>Before discussing the impact on legitimate trade, I would like to briefly describe the reasons why smuggling is so rampant. The beginning of smuggling in the Jidong area was the illegal smuggling of silver dollars by a large number of Japanese and Korean ronin. This was originally a "pressure policy" of the Japanese Kwantung Army to disrupt China's currency. Because of the profits from smuggling silver dollars, they extended their thinking to other goods.  As a result, large quantities of white sugar and rayon were transported from Dalian to Rehe, then loaded onto trucks protected by armed Koreans, and forcibly driven through the various passes of the Great Wall. Because the area was within the war zone, all customs officials were not allowed to carry weapons, so they lacked the ability to resist.</p>
<p>The smugglers' audacity grew, and they believed that direct shipping from Dalian via sea was more profitable. Since October of last year, various ships have begun to appear on the coast around Shanhaiguan and Beidaihe. If customs patrol ships interfered, the Japanese Kwantung Army would protest, claiming it was a violation of the Tanggu Truce. As a result, the naval patrol ships had to withdraw. Furthermore, when smuggled goods were unloaded ashore, if customs officers stepped forward to collect taxes, they often encountered beatings from Koreans. This kind of situation has been seen many times.</p>
<p>Although the Chinese customs authorities have repeatedly protested, the Japanese have ignored them. On the contrary, if a Korean smuggler was slightly injured, the Japanese side would immediately demand huge compensation without any concessions. Later, due to winter freezing, smuggling slightly decreased, but since navigation resumed this spring, smuggling has become even more rampant than before. In desperation, the Chinese customs authorities came up with a plan. On March 21, they contacted the Beining Railway Bureau and requested that no goods be transported without a waybill issued by the customs. Although this measure could not completely eliminate smuggling, it was indeed very effective. Unfortunately, after only three days of implementation, the railway authorities could not withstand the pressure from the Japanese army and broke the agreement. The railway bureau even refused customs to inspect goods at the station. The reason given was that the customs facilities were more complete and could accommodate large quantities of goods, so if smuggled goods were discovered, they could be confiscated and stored in the warehouse. However, the truth was that all smuggled goods had already been piled into their specially leased warehouses, most of which were within the Japanese concession.</p>
<p>The final blow to the Chinese customs was the establishment of a self-reliant customs by the Jidong puppet organization. The taxes levied on smuggled goods were only a quarter of the legitimate customs duties, and it was declared that no further heavy taxes would be levied and that they would not be interfered with by Chinese government tax officials. After the agreement with the railway was broken, the customs' last front collapsed. In the past two months, the import of smuggled goods from Shanhaiguan to Beidaihe has been astonishing. The main centers of smuggling are the beaches near Beidaihe, Qinhuangdao, Nandashi, and Liushouying. In addition, the stations in Qinhuangdao, Beidaihe, Changli, Liushouying, and Luanzhou are also places where various smugglers are active.</p>
<p>Some say that the rampant smuggling in Jidong will inevitably have a great impact on legitimate trade in North China. This statement is not enough to describe the true situation. In short, several important trades in North China have been completely destroyed by it. Smuggled goods are mainly white sugar, rayon, wool fabrics, and cigarette paper. In recent weeks, the types of smuggled goods have increased again, such as kerosene, gasoline, rubber shoes, cotton fabrics, apples, etc., which have been imported into various markets duty-free.</p>
<p>The following is a list of smuggled goods imported in the past four months:</p>
<p>White sugar: 380,000 bags (90 kg per bag)</p>
<p>Rayon: 50,000 bags (45 kg per bag)</p>
<p>Cigarette paper: 500,000 bundles</p>
<p>Cloth: 15,000 packages</p>
<p>Miscellaneous goods: 10,000 boxes</p>
<p>The legitimate sugar industry has been almost completely stagnant since October of last year. Merchants have no transactions at all. This situation is not surprising, because the current price of sugar in the Tianjin market is only 13 yuan per bag, which is only half of the legitimate market price. The tax on imported white sugar should be more than 14 yuan per bag. Even if the customs authorities reduce the sugar tax by 50%, it will not help. There is now a large amount of white sugar piled up in Tianjin, and even smuggled sugar is temporarily difficult to absorb.</p>
<p>The oil industry has also felt the impact of smuggled goods since last month. In April, 20,000 boxes of kerosene and 1,000 boxes of gasoline were shipped from Dalian to Jidong. 85% of them were produced by Japanese oil refineries. The price of this smuggled oil is 2 yuan less per 10 gallons than the price of various legitimate oils. The future of the oil industry is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>The rampancy of the above-mentioned smuggling is due to Japanese protection, which cannot be denied. However, the Japanese side argues that the prevalence of smuggling is caused by excessive tariffs, and that Chinese money is currently invested in smuggling more than Japanese money, so today's smuggling is actually done by the Chinese themselves. The Japanese's strong arguments need not be discussed for the time being. Moreover, the Japanese consular authorities have publicly declared that smuggling into China is not illegal under Japanese law. In other words, the operation of this smuggling has been condoned and directly permitted by the Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>It is inconsistent with international morality for Japan to allow its citizens to engage in smuggling in the territory of friendly nations. However, we must know that this kind of smuggling is being used by the Japanese military authorities to achieve certain political goals. Tariff reduction is still their key demand.</p>
<h3>Completion of the Entire Zhushao Section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway</h3>
<p>The entire line was connected at 10 PM on April 28th. Express trains will first run from Hengzhou to Changsha. Ling Hongxun arrives in Guangzhou to discuss the establishment of a locomotive repair factory.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong-Hankou Railway is divided into the Guangshao Section, the Xiang'e Section, and the Zhushao Section. The first two sections have already been opened to traffic. However, construction on the Zhushao Section only began a little over two years ago and was originally scheduled to be completed in four years. Recently, the authorities, in view of the domestic and international situation, felt that the section needed to be completed quickly so that the north and south points of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway could be directly connected as soon as possible. After receiving the order, the Zhushao Section Railway Bureau stepped up construction day and night.  Until the evening of April 28th, the entire section of track had been laid.  Only the backfilling of collapsed roadbeds, the construction of main bridges, and the laying of ballast remained. Mr. Ling Hongxun of the Zhushao Section Railway Bureau recently went south with Cheng Xiaogang, the Chief of the Machinery Department of the New Railway Planning Committee, and Mr. Feng Jihou, the German consultant of the Ministry of Railways, to discuss future traffic problems with Li Xiangen, the Director of the Guangshao Railway Bureau. It is reported that Ling et al. arrived in Guangdong on the 29th of last month. The next day, they visited Director Li to discuss everything. According to Mr. Ling, the Zhushao Section project was connected at 10 PM on April 28th at Liaojiawan, Yizhang, by the lake. It is found that this section of the project started in July of the 22nd year of the Republic of China and has taken thirty-four months, costing more than 38 million yuan in construction costs. There are still more than 2 million yuan that have not been received, which will be used for road repairs in the future. Once the track is sorted out and the bridges are erected, a special express train will first be opened from Hengzhou to Changsha to connect with the train from Changsha to Wuchang. As for the south line of the section from Hengzhou to Chenzhou, engineering vehicles have been running for a long time. Passenger and freight vehicles have also been running from Pengshi to Lechang. The business situation is good. I decided to go south under the order of the ministry to discuss the establishment of a repair shop in Shaozhou with Director Li Xiangen of the Guangshao Railway Bureau because the Guangdong-Hankou Railway will be fully connected in October, and the repair shop cannot but be planned in advance. During the day, I will go to Shao with Director Li Xiangen and others to survey the site of the factory. As for the machinery of the locomotive repair factory, it has all been transported, and the Ministry of Railways has allocated more than 340,000 yuan for factory construction expenses. Once the factory site is determined in Shao, construction can begin. According to another source, Mr. Ling's decision to come to Guangdong is not only to discuss the establishment of a locomotive repair factory, but also to negotiate with the Guangshao Railway Bureau to unify fares and line symbols for the entire line in the future. It is heard that the result of the discussion is that fares and transportation will be calculated based on mileage, and the value will be based on the silver dollar. Therefore, the southern section of the Railway Bureau will collect silver dollars for fares. If you buy tickets with small silver dollars, you must calculate according to the set ratio. As for the driving symbols, the symbols for starting, stopping, and slowing down are also roughly stipulated. In addition, there is one thing that needs to be implemented urgently, which is to increase the electric welding project for the bridges in the southern section. In the future, the entire line will use new locomotives, and it is feared that the bridges that have not been electric welded before will not be able to bear the weight, so all old bridges must be electric welded. Therefore, Cheng Xiaogang and others who followed Director Ling south inspected the condition of the bridges along the way in order to carry out the electric welding project. It is heard that the electric welding workers are dispatched by the ministry and can arrive in Guangdong in mid-month. At present, the southern section of the Railway Bureau has prepared engineering vehicles for the use of the electric welding workers. (May 1)</p>
<h3>Continuous Rain and Floods in Northern Jiangxi Again</h3>
<p>Newly built dikes are fraught with danger. Many sections of the Nanxun Railway are flooded.</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Northern Jiangxi has a low-lying terrain and is the confluence of the Gan River, Poyang Lake, and the Yangtze River. Floods occur year after year, and the countryside is devastated. The suffering is no less than that of banditry in southern Jiangxi. It is found that along the northern Yangtze River, Poyang Lake, the lower reaches of the Gan River, and the Xiu and Rao Rivers, unprecedented floods occurred last year. The dikes collapsed almost completely. Taking Yongxiu County as an example, not a single dike in the entire county was spared. From last autumn to this spring, although the National Economic Commission and the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau assisted with funds, using work relief and utilizing the corvée labor of the baojia people to engage in construction, it was finally completed. However, the new soil was not strong and could not withstand the impact of floods. This year, after the beginning of spring, the spring rains have been continuous, sometimes intermittent. Mountain torrents have erupted in various rivers, and the lower reaches have inevitably flooded. In recent days, heavy rains have poured down, day and night. Especially on April 27th and 28th, the haze was like a dark world, and the storm continued day and night. The streets and alleys of the city have become a swamp, and there are few pedestrians. The market is even more depressed. Oil, salt, firewood, and rice are soaring day by day. White rice has risen from eight yuan to more than ten yuan per dan, which has a great impact on the lives of the poor. Yesterday, the reporter went to Zhangwai to observe that the water level was flush with the bank, reaching 5.6 meters. The main dikes of the Mawangdang in the territory of Nanxin County are seventy li long. Because they have been recently repaired, they are being hit by the torrents and are fraught with danger. The county magistrate immediately met with Engineer Pu of the Water Conservancy Bureau and assigned laborers to various sections to guard and rescue them. Yongxiu, known as a swamp, was at this time more than ten feet deep in the county seat. Residents had nowhere to eat and sleep and were vying to escape to higher ground. The county magistrate Zuo Jieru has sent an urgent telegram to the provincial government to request relief. The Provincial Relief Association immediately allocated funds to provide emergency relief. The Fanyang County Government also telegraphed yesterday, reporting six disasters. The low-lying areas of the county have become swamps. The disaster victims after the rebellion have suffered another catastrophe and are also in urgent need of relief. On April 30th and the first day of this month, although there was some sunny weather, the spring clouds suddenly unfolded and stopped dripping in an instant. The harvests of tea, rapeseed, wheat, etc., have all been reduced, and many of the low-lying highways in various places have been washed away, and many bridges have been damaged. In the Yongxiu section of the Nanxun Railway, the water is level with the bridges. In the Tujiapu section, the track is flooded by more than a foot. Trains running between Jiujiang and Nanchang all change trains here, and passengers have to get off and take a boat. If the weather does not clear up, the flood may expand. At present, it is the time for planting spring seedlings, and the impact on farming cannot be calculated in terms of miles. (May 2)</p>

<h3>Suzhou: Fire Truck Causes Disaster in the City</h3>
<p>Incidents of fire trucks of various fire brigades in Suzhou running over pedestrians due to unskilled driving have been common. Unexpectedly, in the evening of the 4th, the fire truck of the third section of the fire brigade in the northern district, driven by Liu Husheng, passed through the intersection of the Hulong Street and the Shaipi Alley. Due to the driver's carelessness, an old coolie was knocked down. His head was rubbed by the wheels, and his left ear was rolled off. At that time, blood flowed like a stream. He was immediately taken to the Bu Xiong Hospital for treatment. Because of excessive blood loss, his life was in danger.

<h3>Wuxi: A Homeless Child Seeks Relatives Thousands of Miles Away</h3>
<p>The patrol police of the first sub-bureau of the urban area public security found a suspicious-looking young man in a western suit in the Silangjun Alley yesterday. His appearance was very similar to that of a Westerner. He was Zhangtou, looking around and lingering. The police took him for questioning, according to what he said that his name was Xu Xinlin, nickname A'gen, originally from Ximen, Wuxi. His father's name was Xu Junkang. He went to Shanghai with his mother at the age of seven to make a living. He was abducted by his mother's lover to Hong Kong, and was raised as an adopted son by a Cantonese woman. The Cantonese woman opened a bar in Hong Kong and lived with an Italian machine worker. Later, at the age of twelve, he went to the United States with him to run a tea business. He returned to Hong Kong once. Later, when the Italian-Argentine War broke out last year, the Italian returned to Italy to serve in the military, and his adoptive mother followed him as a nurse. Because he had not registered before, the government gave him 200 yuan to send him back to his country. He bought a half-price boat ticket for 150 yuan and used 50 yuan as travel expenses. After arriving in Shanghai, he transferred to Wuxi to find his biological parents, hoping for a family reunion. He speaks impure Chinese and is fluent in Chinese. He has a leather bag, but his expenses have been exhausted and he has nowhere to live. According to his confession, Director Hong thought that his ambition of seeking relatives thousands of miles away was commendable. He also inquired that he was a Christian, so he sent him to the church for care. At the same time, he helped him find Xu Junkang and carefully investigated the young man's actions.</p>
<h3>Student Strike at Xiguang Middle School</h3>
<p>Xiguang Junior Vocational Middle School in Xichun Street, Dongmen Nei, has been established for five years. After the former principal Cai Ziping resigned, Qian Jihua took over as the president. At the end of the semester in January of this year, President Qian changed to the headmaster of Shen's Primary School. The board of directors promoted Gu Shengwu to act as agent, and was approved by the Ministry of Education for the record. Unexpectedly, two types of mimeographed leaflets in the name of all the students of Xiguang Middle School were suddenly found on the market recently. One was to attack President Gu Shengwu, and the other was to attack Director of Education Zhou Weiquan. At 10 AM, more than 40 students in the third grade, such as Meng Helu, suddenly went on strike and issued a declaration. They went to the County Education Bureau to petition, demanding the removal of the corrupt president. Director Wang Zhaolong and Ji Ganbo, the director of the school education section, came forward to meet them and persuaded the students to go back, study hard, and wait for the investigation. Yesterday morning, the students of the school had returned to class as usual. As for the president's school affairs issues, the mountain board of directors resolved them on its own.</p>
<h3>Changshu: The Shazhou Incident Has Not Yet Subsided</h3>
<p>The Shazhou City rioters caused a great disturbance in opposition to the dredging of the river. After the rioters breached the dam and destroyed the township chief's residence and the Shazhou Hospital, they expected that the government would investigate thoroughly. They had prepared day and night. A cordon has been drawn in Tianhe Township, with sentries posted, and no idlers are allowed to enter their borders. Therefore, when the security team went to the countryside to arrest them yesterday and the day before, they were surrounded. Fortunately, the support team arrived in time to rescue them. As a result, only eleven accomplices were arrested. The main culprits are still at large. Those who have been arrested were all sent to the county yesterday and interrogated by Suzhou officials. Everyone denied participating in the riot. Only Zhu Shuiguan confessed to ringing the gong to gather the crowd and striking twice. The gong was given to me and ordered by an unknown person. At this moment, the county has taken all the prisoners into custody and will be sent to the Wuxi Security Command for review in accordance with military law. As for the rioters who are in the countryside, they have not yet dispersed and demanded the release of the arrested prisoners.

Xiangde met at Panlu Port. Each boat made a big circle, shuttling back and forth dozens of times. The river surface there was narrow, and dozens of boats competed to drive first, causing one of the Wangjiatai faction's boats to hit one of the Lijia Bang faction's boats head-on.

The executive board of directors appointed Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Yao Xijiu, and Li Dachao to be responsible for planning. Architect Dong Dayou was commissioned to design the building. The Shanghai Municipal Government allocated ten mu of land. The architectural plans were repeatedly revised and the style was decided to be aircraft-like, with the exterior made of artificial stone, decorated with Chinese-style carvings, simple and majestic.

He hopes that the people of the whole country will work together. The easiest thing to do is to join as a member to express the spirit of patriotism. The intellectual class should strive for academics to engage in the manufacture and invention of the aviation industry. He also hopes to promote the self-purchase of airplanes to become familiar with aviation and create flying talents. Wu Tiecheng said in his speech that the completion of the new headquarters today hopes to arouse the whole nation's awareness of the importance of the aviation industry and the interest in aviation construction. The survival of the country and the nation lies in material and national defense. Material wealth is used to maintain the survival of the nation, and a substantial national defense is used to maintain the survival of the nation.

<h3>Municipal Government Received Order from the Executive Yuan Yesterday: Expedite Land Survey</h3>
<p>Urban Areas Should Be Dealt with Urgently</p>
<p>Shen Shi Yun, the Municipal Government of Shanghai received an order from the Executive Yuan yesterday, stating, "The Ministry of Interior Affairs submitted a report on April 23, 1936, stating, "According to Article 14 of the General Outline of the Implementation Procedures for Municipal Land Administration in Various Provinces, the implementation procedures for land surveying in various provinces should follow the following guidelines: all municipal areas, provincial capitals, and commercial ports that have not yet carried out land surveys should formulate a survey plan within six months and submit it to the Ministry for approval." This has been communicated to the municipal governments of various provinces for investigation and handling. It has now been found that in the past, land surveys in various provinces have often started with rural farmland, while important urban areas have been handled slowly, which is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 11 of the aforementioned General Outline. Furthermore, the central plan for national land aerial surveying is being coordinated and implemented. However, urban areas are not suitable for aerial surveying due to the obstruction of buildings, so the municipal governments of various provinces should still expedite their handling. The names of the provincial capitals and commercial ports that have been surveyed and not surveyed in various provinces and cities are listed in the attached table. It is proposed to instruct the municipal governments of various provinces to formulate a survey plan for the areas that should be surveyed but have not been surveyed as soon as possible, in accordance with Article 14 of the Implementation Procedures for Land Administration in Various Provinces and Cities, and submit it to the Ministry for approval, in order to comply with the fixed plan. A table of the names of the provincial capitals and commercial ports that have been surveyed and not surveyed in various provinces and cities is attached for your review and approval." According to this, it should be approved as requested. In addition to instructions and distribution, the attached table is copied and issued urgently for compliance. This order.</p>

If there were no various revolutionary obstacles, the achievements would be even greater. Today, on the anniversary of the revolutionary government, we should inherit the legacy of the Premier and complete the revolutionary work. Therefore, there are several points to recognize: Support the National Government and work hard for national revival. Any undertaking should be centered on doctrine. Support the National Government and concentrate the power of the government. Only a strong government can cope with the difficulties of extraordinary times. Supporting the government requires the elimination of the remaining bandits. The Red bandits recognize thieves as fathers and do not hesitate to use China as a last resort. Supporting the National Government requires supporting the revolutionary leader to inherit the legacy of the Premier and complete the National Revolution. However, the leader must have a complete personality, a fair attitude, clear propositions, a bright history, and strong and unyielding talents. Looking around the country, only Mr. Chiang can be competent. Therefore, supporting the National Government should also support the revolutionary leader Chiang, leading us to move forward on the bright road." Then, the meeting was adjourned after shouting slogans.</p>
<p>Slogans</p>
<p>Commemorate the Premier's Great Personality, Complete the Premier's Unfinished Ideals, Unite Sincerely and Overcome National Difficulties Together, Eliminate Red Bandits and Stabilize Society, Work Hard on Construction and Enrich National Strength, Long Live the Chinese Kuomintang, Long Live the Republic of China.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the revolutionary government. All agencies, organizations, schools, and party headquarters in Shanghai, in addition to sending representatives to participate in the commemorative meeting convened by the Municipal Party Headquarters, hoisted flags to celebrate, but did not take a holiday.

<h3>沙市下游柴碼頭附近 日輪撞損華輪</h3>
<p>松丸猛撞民貴輪船</p>
<p>The Japanese ship *Matsumaru* violently collides with the *Mingui* steamship</p>
<p>The *Mingui* steamship, owned by the Minsheng Industrial Company, has a gross tonnage of 986 tons, a length of 192 feet, a width of 30 feet, and a depth of 8 feet. It has three deck levels and a horsepower of 2,200, allowing it to travel at 13.5 nautical miles per hour. It is one of the fastest and best steamships in the company's river fleet. It was recently loaded with cargo for Chongqing. Upon arriving at Hankou, it took on additional cargo and passengers and towed a second barge upstream. When it reached the section of the Yangtze River near the *Chai* Wharf downstream of Shashi, the *Mingui* was</p>
<p>Steaming Uphill.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, a cargo steamship named *Matsumaru*, belonging to the Nisshin Steamship Company, was towing barge number 28, fully loaded from Yichang, going downstream towards Hankou. The Japanese steamship, thinking its speed was high, sailed directly towards the *Mingui* near the *Chai* Wharf. The *Mingui*, seeing the violent approach, tried to avoid it. However, the Japanese ship continued downstream, resulting in</p>
<p>A Violent Collision</p>
<p>The *Mingui* was unable to avoid the collision. The bow of the *Matsumaru* struck the middle of the *Mingui*'s port side, destroying the hull and deck. The damaged area, below the deck and on the outer hull, measured seven to ten feet. Fortunately, the damage was above the waterline, so no water entered, but the damage was significant. After the incident, the owner of the *Mingui* stopped the ship and, together with the owner of the Japanese ship, inspected the damage and signed a document acknowledging responsibility.</p>
<p>Preparing to Negotiate</p>
<p>Because the cargo and passengers on the *Mingui* urgently needed to be transported to Sichuan, and the damage did not prevent navigation, the ship continued upstream with the damage, first to Yichang and then to Chongqing to report to the company. Upon arriving at Yichang, the Customs authorities were asked to inspect the damage to facilitate serious negotiations with the Japanese ship for compensation. At the same time, the foreign insurance company in Shanghai that insured the ship was notified by telegram to send someone to inspect the damage, after which negotiations and repairs would be carried out.</p>
<h3>Concession Telephone Subscribers Raise Complaints about Inaccurate Metering</h3>
<p>Since the Concession Telephone Company implemented metered billing, subscribers have been complaining to the Telephone Problems Committee about the company's inaccurate metering. The following are excerpts from letters received: A letter from the *Huiji* Trading Company on Sijing Road states: "To whom it may concern, since the January 28th Incident, Shanghai has suffered from internal and external troubles, and the economic downturn has reached an extreme. It is fortunate for businesses to maintain the status quo, and even more rare to pay dividends. However, the telephone company, which earns substantial dividends annually, wants to increase prices, which is unreasonable. Furthermore, limiting the number of calls is unheard of in other countries. Their pursuit of private interests without regard for public welfare is beyond description. Our March bill was as high as $21.25. Upon checking, the number of calls was not that many. The company is arbitrarily recording calls and charging users exorbitant fees. Their greed for profit, without considering the burden on citizens, is unacceptable. We are attaching the bill and hope you will work hard to negotiate and achieve the goal of abolishing this system. Furthermore, we have found that all telephones used by Japanese businesses on North Sichuan Road have not been charged, yet their lines have not been disconnected. Please also pay attention to this matter." A letter from Ding Mingfei of Chengdu Road states: "To whom it may concern, we moved from Park Road to our current location on February 24th. We notified the company to send a technician to move the telephone, but it was not installed until the 29th. In early March, we received a bill for $8.61, which we paid. However, upon reviewing the March 14th bill, we found that the total was $21.36, which does not match our own records. Therefore, we are resolutely participating in the resistance plan proposed by your committee and will not pay the bill, even if it means disconnection. Yesterday, we read in the newspaper that your committee instructed subscribers to register their complaints. We are submitting all the details and hope you will include our account. We are willing to join the resistance and will not reinstall the telephone until our goal is achieved."</p>
<h3>Bank of China Invests in North China Textile Industry</h3>
<p>Organizes Textile Industry Management Association Attending Delegates Arrive in Shanghai for Visits</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, seven yarn factories in Hebei, Henan, and Shanxi provinces, including *Daxing*, *Yufeng*, and *Puhua*, have formed a Textile Industry Management Association under the leadership of the Bank of China. The association held a meeting in Zhengzhou recently. The bank sent *Zai Fuli* to attend, and he returned to Shanghai on the 4th after the meeting. More than a dozen delegates also came to inspect the textile industry in Shanghai, Wuxi, and Changzhou for observation and learning. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Formation of Association</p>
<p>The Bank of China has made substantial loans to the textile industry in North China. To improve the technology and operations of these factories, the Hebei, Henan, and Shanxi Textile Industry Management Association was formed and recently held a meeting. Fourteen delegates from various factories attended, and the bank sent *Zai Fuli*. The following resolutions were passed: Establish a joint cotton purchasing office at a public location. Discuss and allocate the purchase and distribution of cotton according to each factory's planned purchasing ratio. Standardize cost accounting items for all factories and set appropriate expenditure standards for the most common yarn and cloth. All factories should notify each other of the daily sales prices of yarn and cloth to avoid manipulation by intermediaries and to understand market trends. All factories should exchange samples of private cotton components and yarn sliver thickness to ensure consistent quality and increase confidence in domestic yarn. All factories should consult each other and provide sincere advice. If conducting on-site inspections, detailed guidance should be provided to facilitate mutual learning and achieve improvement. The principles of modifying the spinning of fine yarn and engaging in bleaching, dyeing, printing, finishing, and export taxes were also approved, depending on actual needs.</p>
<p>Delegates Arrive South</p>
<p>The delegates attending the meeting included Liu Chijun, Zhang Zhusan, Li Hansan, Zhang Minggang, Wang Wenzhu, Dong Hengqu, Chen Peizhai, Yan Qingxiang, Hu Runsen, and fifteen others. After the meeting, they accompanied the Bank of China representative, *Zai Junlai*, to Shanghai. Through the introduction of the Yarn Factory Association, they visited the *Shensheng* No. 6 Factory, *Rende*, *Hengda*, and other yarn factories on the 4th. In the evening, they were hosted by the Association. On the 5th, they visited the *Daxin* No. 1 and No. 8 factories, *Dalong* Iron Factory, *Dingxin*, and *Xinyu* No. 1 and No. 2 factories. In the evening, they were hosted by the General Federation of Industry. They are scheduled to visit Suzhou tomorrow (the 6th), then Wuxi on the 7th, and Changzhou on the 9th, before returning to Shanghai and heading north. The delegates, who are managers or engineers from various factories, came south for observation and learning to improve their operations.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Rice Fragments Still Subject to Foreign Rice Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously requested the Ministry of Finance to maintain the method of taxing rice fragments according to grain standards, based on a request from the Grain Merchants Association. After sending a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, the following reply was received: "To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: Your telegram has been received. Since rice fragments have been taxed according to the import tariff for grain, merchants have been avoiding the foreign rice tax by ordering finely processed rice fragments containing whole rice from abroad for sale in China. To implement the original intention of collecting foreign rice tax to protect domestic rice and grain production, it is necessary to stop this improper import. Therefore, the Ministry has canceled the method of taxing rice fragments according to grain standards and stipulated that, from April 11th, imported rice fragments should be taxed as rice to restrict this practice. According to customs regulations, tariffs on foreign goods have always been applied according to the tax rate in effect at the time of import. The four to five thousand tons of rice fragments ordered by Shanghai rice merchants were imported after the implementation of the rice tax on April 11th, so they should be subject to the new regulations and pay the rice fragment tax. Regarding the four thousand two hundred tons of rice fragments imported by Ningbo, we have instructed the customs to verify and handle the matter, as this batch of rice fragments was purchased by rice merchants under the supervision of the Yinxian Grain Management Committee for the specific purpose of providing relief to the poor and storing reserves for famine relief. The rice fragments imported by Shanghai merchants are self-managed and self-sold and cannot be compared. The request to instruct the customs to make an exception and levy half tax should not be considered. Please inform accordingly. Seal of the Ministry of Finance."</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram to Ministry of Finance Requesting Flexible Regulations for Sampan Registration</h3>
<p>Sampans Travel Irregularly, Do Not Limit Registration to Original Location Allow Customs Offices in All Locations to Handle</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance yesterday stating: "To the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: We have recently received a letter from the Yantai Chamber of Commerce stating: 'We have received a letter from the Shidao District Chamber of Commerce in Rongcheng County stating that the current customs procedure for registering sampans and issuing route books requires re-registration and renewal of the route book after one year. When the registration was initially decided, sampans were instructed to register at the customs office where they were stationed. Therefore, after the expiration, the customs office still requires sampans to go to the original registering customs office to register and obtain the route book. Sampan merchants are now claiming that sampans travel irregularly, and it would be difficult to require them to return to the original registering customs office for registration, as the sampan may not have any business dealings with that port at the time and would have to travel there solely for registration, causing delays and losses. Now that the customs offices are unified, they should be able to handle registrations regardless of location and alleviate difficulties. This type of difficulty is likely common in your port. We plan to jointly request the Shanghai China National Federation of Chambers of Commerce to forward the situation to the Ministry of Finance for flexible handling, allowing sampans to register directly at the customs office where they are located when the registration expires, to avoid unnecessary travel and facilitate navigation. We agree with this and hope for a prompt reply and direct handling.' The points mentioned are reasonable and should be forwarded for flexible handling to facilitate navigation. In addition to replying in agreement, we are sending this telegram to you for your review. We respectfully request that you forward this situation to the Ministry of Finance, consider the circumstances, and approve flexible handling so that merchants and residents along the coast will be deeply grateful. Signed, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, with seal."</p>

<h3>Foreign Tea Merchants Decide to Open Exchanges and Conduct Business as Usual Today</h3>
<p>Accept Chamber of Commerce Advice to Safeguard the Tea Market and Finances However, Loans for Black Tea Still Need to Await Proper Resolution</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce believes that the suspension of exchanges and closure of business by foreign tea merchants for more than ten days has had a significant impact on the tea market and finances. Following the advice of the Municipal Government to resume business, they sent another letter of advice yesterday. The Association decided yesterday to allow the exchange of all green tea drafts from various firms starting today and to conduct business as usual. However, loans for Anhui and Jiangxi black tea still need to await a proper resolution before exchanges can be resumed. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Municipal Government Instruction</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Anhui Province planning to control the transport and sale of black tea, the Association previously submitted a telegram with a compromise plan and requested it be forwarded. The government has forwarded the telegram to the Anhui Provincial Government and issued instructions. Tea is a major product of our country and occupies an important position in international trade. Now that the tea season has arrived, the prolonged closure of tea firms will have a significant impact on foreign trade and hinder industrial and commercial livelihoods, which is of great concern. It is hereby ordered that the Association immediately comply with the instruction to urge the tea industry to resume business immediately and not delay any further. This is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Sends Another Letter</p>
<p>To whom it may concern, since the suspension of exchanges by your association, it has been more than ten days, and the tea market and finances have been affected. This Chamber of Commerce sent a letter of advice on the first of this month, urging you to resume business and open exchanges first, and then discuss remedial measures. The Standing Committee of this Chamber of Commerce also resolved at its temporary meeting on the fourth of this month that Chairman Yu of this Chamber of Commerce should send a letter to Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry and the Anhui Provincial Government to discuss a compromise to take all parties into account. Having recorded the instructions above, they are sent to you accordingly. It is hoped that your Association will convene all members and immediately comply with the order to resume business and report the resumption of business for record. This is of utmost importance. To the Shanghai Foreign Tea Merchants Association.</p>
<p>Foreign Firms Warning</p>
<p>A letter from various foreign firms states: "To whom it may concern, if your association suspends exchanges due to a dispute with the Anhui Provincial Government regarding Qi tea, it will have a significant impact on green tea. If the opening of green tea is delayed, consumers may turn to buying from Japan. Once business is lost, it will be difficult to recover. We dare to ask your association to separate the Qi tea issue from the green tea issue and resume business for the sake of green tea. The Qi tea issue will eventually be resolved. Please accept our opinion. Respectfully, [signatures of Yihe, Tongfu, Xiehe, Tianyu, Jinlong, and other foreign firms]"</p>
<p>Discussion of Measures</p>
<p>After the Foreign Tea Merchants Association accepted the principle of advice, they needed to agree on concrete measures to handle Qi black tea and green tea separately. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Chen Yizhou, the representative of the industry, went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce again to discuss the measures for opening exchanges with Secretary Yan Esheng. Yan father urged that, in any case, the green tea portion must be resumed first to seize the opportunity. The representative then reconvened with various members at 2:00 PM yesterday to further discuss the measures for opening exchanges. It was decided on the spot that the green tea drafts of various firms would be allowed to be exchanged from May 6th and business would be conducted as usual. However, loans for Anhui and Jiangxi black tea would still need to wait for a proper resolution before exchanges could be resumed. An announcement will be published in the newspaper immediately.</p>
<p>Announcement of Opening Exchanges</p>
<p>The Shanghai Foreign Tea Merchants Association's announcement of opening green tea drafts states: "To whom it may concern, this Association, due to the Anhui Province's control of black tea, has been exhausted in its appeals and has had no choice but to suspend exchanges and close business on April 23rd. All the details can be seen in the declaration. Now that the green tea is arriving, there is no time to wait. We have been advised by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and also received instructions from the Municipal Government. In addition, Director Zhao of the Agricultural Department of the National Economic Commission sent Commissioner Ling Shumo to Shanghai to advise us to resume business. In addition, industrial and commercial groups from various tea-producing areas have sent letters and telegrams, all urging us to consider the livelihoods of tea merchants and tea farmers. The foreign firms have also repeatedly sent letters urging us to display samples. This Association, deeply appreciating the good intentions of the upper echelons and public groups, and considering the matter concerns the people's livelihood and the national economy, could not bear to ignore it. Therefore, we have unanimously decided to allow the exchange of all green tea drafts from various firms starting from May 6th, and business will be conducted as usual. However, loans for Anhui and Jiangxi black tea will still need to wait for a proper resolution before exchanges can be resumed. In addition to sending a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward to the Silver and Money Trade Associations for their information, this announcement is hereby published for your information. We hope for your understanding."</p>
<p>Reply to Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Association replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce stating: "To whom it may concern, we have received your letter of advice to open exchanges, and on the 5th, we received Official Letter No. 960 forwarding the order of the Municipal Government. In addition, Director Zhao of the Agricultural Tea Department of the National Economic Commission specially sent Commissioner Ling Shumo to Shanghai to persuade us. This Association, deeply appreciating the goodwill of the upper echelons and your Association, has unanimously decided to allow the exchange of all green tea drafts from various firms starting from May 6th, and business will be conducted as usual. As for the Anhui and Jiangxi black tea drafts, because their matter with the Anhui and Jiangxi Transportation and Sales Committee has not been resolved, exchanges will remain suspended for the time being. We are enclosing the published announcement with this letter for your information and to forward to the Silver and Money Trade Associations for their information. We extend our deepest friendship. To the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<h3>Red Swastika Society Allocates Funds for Relief in Anhui Disaster</h3>
<p>The counties in western Anhui have suffered severe drought, with no green grass in the fields and widespread starvation. The situation is too horrible to witness. The Joint Office of the Red Swastika Society in Southeast China has allocated 3,000 yuan for relief, together with more than 2,000 yuan raised by the Wuhu branch, totaling more than 5,000 yuan. Liu Xichun and Chen Tianru have been publicly recommended to go to Huoqiu to handle emergency relief. However, according to the association's investigation report, there are as many as 340,000 people in Huoqiu County in need of relief. Although Tang Mufen, a member of the Central Relief Commission, has established four porridge kitchens in the county, and the Huoqiu Red Swastika Society has established one in the city, totaling five, each kitchen has a budget of 500 yuan and can only accommodate 1,200 people. Those who starve to death outside the kitchens every day are a common sight. The disaster areas in Liu'an, Lihuang, and Hefei are in the same dire situation. It is hoped that philanthropists from all walks of life will rise up to save them.</p>
<h3>Report of Special Commissioner Sent by Chinese and Foreign Joint Relief Committee to Inspect Anhui Disaster</h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Joint Relief Committee on Renji Road believes that the drought disaster in counties in northern Anhui is severe. In addition to establishing a branch in Fuyang to facilitate separate relief efforts, they are still concerned that the relief may not be sufficient. Therefore, they sent a special commissioner to inspect the situation to clarify the truth. According to the commissioner's report yesterday, they have arrived in Shou County. The detailed disaster situation is recorded as follows: "Shou County has more than one hundred villages and towns divided into five districts. The south of the city, which faces the Huai River, has been personally inspected. Within thirty miles, the terrain is winding, and the government cultivates beans and wheat. However, in low-lying areas, even after just a little rain, it is flooded, and the harvest is hopeless. The two southeastern villages, more than thirty miles away, have higher terrain but are only suitable for planting rice, not wheat. In short, they only harvest one season a year. This is just the planting situation. The county suffered a flood in 1931, and its vitality was lost. In 1933, it suffered banditry. In 1934, it suffered a severe drought. The people are exhausted and impoverished. Last spring, people lacked food, and grass roots and tree bark were stripped bare. From summer to autumn, it was followed by drought. Those near the river slightly harvested some beans, but those more than thirty miles away from the city not only did not grow rice, but also had no grass seeds. Therefore, the disaster situation is most severe in the third, fourth, and fifth districts, while the first and second districts are half severe and half resolvable. The number of disaster victims in the entire county is no less than 200,000. At first, there was robbery, and then there was displacement. In the southeastern villages, there were many who dismantled houses, unloaded beams, and sold farm tools to make ends meet. Those who have eaten their seeds and have no cattle left are eight or nine out of ten. In recent days, I have witnessed disaster victims along the roads in the city and countryside, begging for food and crying from hunger. The scene is heartbreaking. Moreover, there are more than a thousand disaster victims gathered in the city, and the number is inevitably increasing day by day. They are all emaciated and lifeless, and there are reports of people dying on the road every day. In the villages near the city, wheat seedlings have been planted, but the harvest season is still far away and cannot solve the immediate need. It is currently the time between harvests. If relief can be provided as soon as possible, the general populace can be saved from death. This is truly a great virtue. Tomorrow, I will go to Zhengyangguan and Ying on the way to inspect and report."</p>

Previous resolutions of the association could not be accepted by the fish market, leading to most member companies voluntarily withdrawing and reclaiming their shares.

How the association should respond was requested to be discussed by all present. (B) Resolutions: As the fish market will open on the 11th of this month, the association believes that all businesses should strictly adhere to their respective boundaries as intermediaries. According to the general rules of limited liability companies, third parties cannot be restricted. This intention should be conveyed to the board of directors of the fish market. Many fish merchants have sent letters inquiring about the association's final stance, regarding whether all members should join the market and future arrangements. It was resolved to publish a public announcement regarding the business attitude of each member company. Regarding how to handle all expenses incurred in the dispute with the fish market, it was resolved that legitimate expenses should be reimbursed from the association's expenditures. Regarding how to handle the expiration of the terms of the executive and supervisory committee members, it was resolved to hold a re-election on May 20th, and to report to the higher authorities in advance to send personnel for guidance.

<h3>Hu Ji'an Sued by His Father's Concubine, Ms. Li, for Alimony, Continued Trial</h3>
<p>Ms. Li Submits Additional Reasons to the Court, Defendant Argues Inability to Pay Large Sums</p>
<p>-The Court Orders Both Parties to Appear in Person-</p>
<p>Hu Ganqing, a shareholder of Beijing Road Hu Qing Yu Tang Pharmacy and Nanshi Fuchang Ginseng Shop, passed away in 1929. His concubine, Ms. Li, recently hired lawyers Zhang Qiuzhao and Peng Yuanxun to file a lawsuit with the Special Court No. 1 Civil Division against Hu Ji'an, Ganqing's son, demanding a lump-sum payment of 43,320 yuan for alimony and 10,000 yuan for debt repayment. The court had already summoned the parties once, and the details had been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that the plaintiff, Hu Li, through her agents, lawyers Zhang and Peng,</p>
<p>Supplied Reasons</p>
<p>Continued to petition the court, amending the alimony request. The petition stated, in brief, that during the previous court hearing, the defendant's lawyers argued that the plaintiff was wasteful and that the defendant had not inherited a large inheritance, which was completely false and made people unwilling to remain silent. It was discovered that the defendant falsely claimed that the plaintiff installed a separate telephone in the room, which was wasteful. It should be known that the telephone in the house was installed in the defendant's room. Whenever relatives and friends called the plaintiff, they were often rejected, so another one had to be installed. It was also said that the plaintiff had withdrawn all of the 3,000 yuan in savings. It was discovered that the late husband Ganqing only gave 3,000 yuan in savings, which was in the winter of 1926, and it has been ten years since then. During this period, after</p>
<p>The Late Husband's Death</p>
<p>Expenses for her own medical care, entertaining relatives, etc., would amount to only about 300 yuan per year if calculated annually. For a lady of a prominent family who lives in an expensive area of Shanghai, what is so strange about spending two or three hundred yuan more a year? Moreover, the defendant personally borrowed 1,000 yuan from this amount and only returned 600 yuan last January. The defendant previously asked his father for money but was not granted it. He repeatedly asked the plaintiff to intercede. The plaintiff, seeing that his father was seriously ill, did not want to say much and had to pay for it in installments. Later, his father passed away, so the money the plaintiff borrowed was never recovered. The defendant also ignored it, and the creditors demanded payment. How could the savings</p>
<p>Be Preserved?</p>
<p>The defendant said that the property was only 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, which is not true. After Ganqing's death, there was property left behind, such as the residence on Guling Road, worth about 70,000 yuan, and the Nanshi Caochang Ginseng Shop, which has a capital of more than 1 million yuan, with a total of 13 shares, of which the defendant has 5 shares. Dechang Ginseng Shop has a capital of 400,000 yuan, of which the defendant has 5 shares. There is also one share of Baoda Ginseng Shop and two shares of Hu Qing Yu Tang. All of the above are facts and should be investigated by your office. The defendant often allocates money from the ginseng shop to</p>
<p>Speculative Businesses</p>
<p>Resulting in many losses, and indulging in excessive sexual pleasures and recklessly taking concubines. Now his mother, wife, and children have all moved to Hangzhou, unable to live together. There are countless other businesses operating under false names. Judging from the situation, although the defendant's family property is rich, once the contents are exposed, he will have no place to stand. For the sake of the plaintiff's lifelong livelihood, it is requested that the living expenses be paid in a lump sum. Yesterday afternoon, this case was continued in the Civil Division No. 4 by Judge Peng. The plaintiff's lawyers stated the above situation. The defendant also hired lawyers Lu Shaozong and Xi Shichang to argue that the plaintiff's savings of 3,000 yuan had indeed been</p>
<p>Gradually Withdrawn</p>
<p>Currently, only a little over 50 yuan remains, as can be seen from the account books submitted as evidence. Now the plaintiff is demanding a lump-sum payment of over 40,000 yuan in alimony, which the defendant is really unable to bear, and this kind of request is not beneficial to either party. Even if the defendant pays the alimony in a lump sum, the plaintiff will only be comfortable for a while, and when the money is used up in the future, she will still suffer. Moreover, the defendant is really unable to pay. The defendant currently has only one wife and one concubine and has never engaged in speculative businesses. The reason is that another concubine of the defendant's late father once used</p>
<p>Her Mother's Name</p>
<p>To claim rights from the defendant, which led to a lawsuit in court. As a result, because the concubine lived outside, the defendant was ordered to pay 100 yuan per month for living expenses. Later, the defendant appealed and reached a settlement through mediation, reluctantly raising 8,000 yuan for the settlement. The plaintiff in this case is following suit, but she does not know that the defendant still has a father's concubine at home. If she also files a lawsuit, then the defendant can only declare bankruptcy. Therefore, it is requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. Judge Peng adjourned the case and ordered both parties to appear in court for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Robbers Posing as Detectives Search for Contraband and Rob</h3>
<p>A Detective Arrests a Robber</p>
<p>Zhang A'er, a robber from Jiangbei, 28 years old, who lives on a small boat in the riverbank of Datong Road in Zhabei, colluded with three other accomplices at noon the day before yesterday and went to Hu Changfa's house at No. 17, Lane 175, Huanghe Road, French Concession, armed with weapons, posing as detectives. On the pretext of searching for dangerous contraband, they robbed 137 yuan in legal tender. When they were carrying the loot outside, they fired a shot into the sky as a warning and fled north. When passing near the Great World, they happened to be patrolled by Inspectors Jiang Futian, Detectives Wang Rusong, and Liu Jinrong, etc. Seeing that Zhang and others were suspicious, they stepped forward to arrest them.

<h3>Xiang Stage Owner Wang Shubao Arrested on Suspicion of Murder</h3>
<p>Someone Leaked Flyers Claiming Wang Was a Murderous Fugitive</p>
<p>The Court Detained Wang and Summoned Wu Xiufeng Yesterday</p>
<p>During the Shanghai War in 1932, the Hongkou area fell into a state of anarchy, and the mutual killing of gangsters was common. At that time, Ji Zhongtang, a native of Jiangbei who had served as a detective in the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, was sentenced to two years in prison by the local court for fraud. When the war broke out, he was released upon the expiration of his term. He went to the war zone in Hujiamuqiao, Hongkou. According to rumors at the time, he opened a gambling den under the cover of the war zone, but he did not divide the profits evenly with the local gangsters and was shot dead in a small teahouse. His disciple Zhang Xiaowanzi testified that he was killed by Zheng Xiaoheizi, Wang Sanshizi, Wang Shubao, etc. After the coffin was taken to the Nanshi Local Court for identification, until the end of the war in the restored area, Ji's wife, Ji Chen, filed a complaint with the court, and Zheng Xiaoheizi was arrested. After investigation, and according to the testimony of the witness, the wife of the deceased, etc., it was clarified that he was not the murderer in this case and was sentenced to non-prosecution. Unexpectedly, the current owner of the Xiang Stage, Wang Shubao, was suddenly revealed to be the Wang Shushi at the time, a murderous fugitive, and anonymous flyers were distributed, containing insulting words about the official office due to an ambiguous relationship with the female entertainer Yu Yanfang of the stage and the lawyer Huang Zonglu's father, Huang Guojun, who had served as the chief prosecutor in the court. Therefore, in order to thoroughly investigate the case, the court arrested and detained Wang Shubao and summoned Zhang Xiaowanzi, who was a witness at the time, who claimed that it was not Wang Shubao. Later, it was discovered that Wang Shubao had also been arrested by the Public Security Bureau's Detective Team for this case before. How he was released should be investigated. Yesterday, Wu Xiufeng, the detective who handled the arrest at the time, was summoned to the case and testified that this case was when Lu Ying was the captain of the detective team. I arrested Wang Shubao and handed him over to the team. Later, the witness Zhang Dawanzi was summoned, who claimed that the murderer was Wang Shubao, a native of Anhui, who was black and rough-skinned, and not this Wang Shubao. Therefore, the captain released him. Since the official had already obtained a suspect, why didn't he hand him over to the court, but released him directly? He replied that this was because the witness proved that the wrong person had been arrested, so the captain released him. The official ordered him to leave and wait for further summons of witnesses to be interrogated and investigated.</p>
<h3>Robbery at a Foreign Goods Store on Avenue Edward VII: One Robber Shot Dead, One Robber Captured Alive</h3>
<p>Entered the Store Under the Pretense of Shopping and Suddenly Robbed</p>
<p>After the Robbery, the Store Employees Chased After Them and Finally Captured Them</p>
<p>At about 7 p.m. last night, the Caoxiantai Foreign Goods Store at No. 276 Avenue Edward VII was suddenly robbed. Two robbers escaped with the loot. As a result, one robber was captured on the spot, and one robber was chased and shot dead by detectives near the Yuegui Lane intersection of Zhengjia Muqiao and Shilu, Public Concession. The details are listed below:</p>
<p>Sudden Arrival of Two Robbers</p>
<p>Caoxiantai Foreign Goods Store was opened by Cao Zicai, a local. The store front is a single-bay city house. Although the scope is small, the business is still able to be maintained. It has been in business for many years, but it was coveted by robbers. At 7:50 p.m. last night, just after the store finished dinner, two robbers suddenly came, one wearing a blue cloth long gown and one wearing a blue thread spring jacket outside a mandarin jacket, speaking with a Shandong accent.</p>
<p>Following and Chasing</p>
<p>When the two robbers entered the store, they claimed to be shopping. The store staff did not pay attention at first. Unexpectedly, while they were negotiating the price, the two robbers suddenly took out pistols and forbade any noise. One robber immediately went around to the counter and grabbed 15 yuan in legal tender from the drawer. They escaped with the loot. After the two robbers left the store, they immediately fled into the nearby Baoxing Lane, passing through the main alley to the Caishi Street. The store staff immediately followed behind and chased after them, sounding the police whistle.</p>
<p>One Robber Captured</p>
<p>As soon as the police whistle sounded, the nearby detectives all cooperated in the pursuit. After the two robbers came out of the alley, they split up and fled east and west. One robber heading west was captured by Hua Bu No. 824 at the Dongxinqiao Street tram intersection. One robber heading east fled to Zhengjia Muqiao Street and turned north, crossing Avenue Edward VII and arriving at the Yuegui Lane entrance of Shilu, Public Concession, at the Jin Hongxing Noodle Shop entrance, where French Bu No. 220 and the Public Concession guard there fired several shots from behind, knocking the robber to the ground and capturing him.</p>
<p>One Robber Shot Dead</p>
<p>At the same time, the Central Police Station of the Public Concession also immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the scene. They first sent the wounded robber to Renji Hospital. After the doctor's inspection, it was found that the robber had one bullet in his right face and one bullet in his right leg. Because the injuries were in vital parts, he died shortly after arriving at the hospital. The body was then transferred to the Filun Road Morgue to await a report to the court for inspection. The robber who was captured alive was immediately escorted to the French Police Station.</p>
<p>Waiting to be Sent to Court</p>
<p>After the robber was taken to the French Police Station, the captain interrogated him strictly. According to the confession, his name was Liu Yonghua, a native of Shandong, who was the robber wearing a blue cloth long gown. Liu also confessed that the robber who was shot dead was named Jia Guazhang, also a native of Shandong, who was the robber wearing a line of spring jacket outside a mandarin jacket. The police station also found that the two robbers had stayed in Room 68 of the Jiuhua Hotel on Shandong Road the day before yesterday. The circulation book was signed as He Jinzhi. After the captain finished the interrogation, he ordered them to be detained and wait to be sent to the Second Special Court for trial.</p>
<h3>Da Shanghai Printing Company Forges Legal Tender, Case Cracked</h3>
<p>Several Machines Confiscated, Company Already Sealed</p>
<p>The Da Shanghai Printing Company at No. 3, Lane 3, North Sichuan Road, forged the legal tender of the Central and China Banks. The nearby police station was reported a few days ago and ordered the police to rush to the scene. Wang A'gen and others were arrested on the spot, reported to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, and transferred to the Songhu Garrison Command for investigation and handling. At about 11 a.m. yesterday, the Garrison Command sent Judge Advocate Lu Zhenfu, Adjutant Peng Bingxia, and others by car to the North Sichuan Road Police Station, added Police Chief Sang Weihan, and went together to the Da Shanghai Printing Company at No. 3, Lane 3, North Sichuan Road to inspect several machines for manufacturing counterfeit legal tender, fill in the table one by one, seal the door, and search out a lot of unfinished counterfeit legal tender, which were taken to the headquarters for filing.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau Permits Rickshaws, License Donations Extended to the 9th</h3>
<p>Mutual Aid Society Fees for May Temporarily Postponed</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of rickshaws in the Public Concession, after meetings between the Public Works Bureau and rickshaw operators, the Public Works Bureau has accepted the operators' request to reorganize the Mutual Aid Society. Due to the approaching deadline for license renewals this month and pressing issues requiring negotiation, operators yesterday sent representatives Yin Zhiling, Hou Shao'an, Wang Kunyi, Zhao Rongfu, and others to the Public Works Bureau for further discussions. They were received by Director-General Fessenden, Deputy Director-General Phillips, and Chairman of the Rickshaw Committee Massey. It was agreed that license donations for this month would be extended to the 9th, and that only the already collected Mutual Aid Society fee for April would be paid, with the May fee temporarily postponed. The operators' representatives stated that the views of the rickshaw pullers on the Mutual Aid Society were still being gathered. The Public Works Bureau has indicated that it will reorganize the Mutual Aid Society in the shortest possible time, but that a considerable period of discussion will be required. The Operators' Association issued a notice yesterday stating: "Notice regarding the various issues concerning rickshaws, which have remained unresolved. Each operator has already deposited five yuan and one jiao per license at the Shanghai Bank, awaiting negotiations for license donations, in order to maintain consistency. Now, as a result of negotiations between our Association representatives and the Public Works Bureau, the Mutual Aid Society will be thoroughly reorganized in the shortest possible time. The issue of rickshaw puller registration will be considered for increasing the quota after five thousand people have been registered. Regarding this month's license donations, only one month of the already collected Mutual Aid Society fee for April will be paid for now. As for the license donation deadline, due to the prolonged negotiations, it is not possible to process within the standard timeframe. It has been agreed that the license donation deadline for this month will be extended to May 9th (Saturday). The license fees and Mutual Aid Society fees have already been paid by the Association on behalf of the operators. All operators who have already paid the license fee of five yuan and one jiao to the Shanghai Bank should bring their payment receipts from the bank and the receipt of the certificate previously issued by the Association to the Association before May 9th to collect their rickshaw owner's certificate and obtain a license for operation from the Public Works Bureau's rickshaw donation office on Fairness Road. (No further payment will be required when obtaining the license.) As for the fees paid by each operator, in addition to the one month's donation for the British Concession license fee and Mutual Aid Society fee paid by the Association, the remaining amount will be converted to Chinese licenses by the Association. All accounts will be settled when obtaining the Chinese licenses. As for the Mutual Aid Society fee collected for May, since the opinions of all rickshaw pullers on the Mutual Aid Society issue have not yet been published, operators should continue to collect as before. We are afraid that this has not been fully publicized, hence this notice."</p>
<h3>Prison Barrister Sues for Defamation</h3>
<p>Xue Zhenyi Released from Prison, Sues Zhao Guangfu</p>
<p>Zhao Guangfu, the perpetrator of the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World, stated during the appeal trial of Gu Zhuxuan that he was instructed by prison barrister Xue Zhenyi and Zhu Jingcheng, among others, to extort Gu. Now that Xue has been released from prison, he claims that Zhao Guangfu has groundlessly damaged his reputation. In addition to retaining lawyer Yang Yunmei to publish a statement in the newspaper, he has also filed a criminal self-prosecution with the Second Special Court, accusing Zhao Guangfu of defamation. The court has accepted the case and scheduled a hearing for this morning.</p>
<h3>Why Do Bandits Seize Cars?</h3>
<p>Xiangsheng Car Hired to Western Shanghai, Bandits Force Driver Out</p>
<p>At 8:30 PM last night, three men suddenly arrived at the Xiansheng Automobile Branch at the Old West Gate in Nanshi, claiming they wanted to hire a car to Columbia Road in western Shanghai. The branch's accountant ordered driver A to drive out a car, license number 18503. The three men boarded the car, and the driver started the engine, heading straight for the French Concession via Heping Road. They drove swiftly towards Columbia Road. Upon reaching their destination, one of the passengers brandished a handgun, intimidating the driver and ordering him out of the car. One of them then drove the car west. The driver had no choice but to report the hijacking to the nearby police station. The police station has now notified all police agencies in the city to search for the whereabouts of the car.</p>
<h3>Husband Makes Red Pills, Wife Responsible for Transport</h3>
<p>Modern Couple Trafficking Drugs, Both Arrested and Awaiting Sentence</p>
<p>Guo Ruiyu and Wang Rulin, detectives from the Narcotics Division of the General Patrol Station, received information that someone would be transporting red pills, passing through the intersection of Tibet Road and Baker Road in the afternoon. They went there to wait, and a Wuxi woman, Qian Li (also known as Jinmei, 19 years old), passed by. The detectives stopped her and found six hundred red pills hidden in her waistband. She was taken back to the police station and questioned. She confessed that her husband, Qian Canlin, had instructed her to deliver them to a coal shop on Tibet Road to sell. The detectives then went to the front room of number 28, Lane 76, Xiamen Road, arrested Qian, and confiscated red dye used for making red pills, coffee essence, a bag of white powder, two sieves, a red pill lamp gun, and two red pills. According to his confession, all the raw materials were purchased from a certain place in the French Concession. Yesterday morning, they were jointly sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted according to Article 256, Section 2 of the Criminal Code. Qian Li confessed that she had only been married to Qian Canlin for a year. Her husband had been making red pills for three months, making one batch every week, totaling five bags, or two thousand five hundred pills. Each bag was sold for three yuan and six jiao. She had delivered ten batches in total. The red pill lamp gun was prepared because her mother was addicted to it. In the past, he used a machine to make them, but it has now been sold, so he makes them by hand. Qian Canlin confessed that because his mother-in-law smoked red pills, and it was not easy to buy them outside, and his wife's younger sisters could make red pills, he made them himself, but each bag was only sold for one yuan and eight jiao. Judge Liu Yugui verified the confessions and ordered them to be detained pending sentencing this Thursday.</p>
<h3>Yokohama Bridge on North Sichuan Road, Japanese Exhibition Building Collapses</h3>
<p>New Building Completed One Week Ago Suddenly Collapses</p>
<p>Seven Japanese Seriously Injured, Four Chinese Slightly Injured</p>
<p>The clubhouse of a certain Japanese exhibition hall at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Yokohama Bridge and North Shiqing Road, built by the Dongya Construction Company, reportedly cost only over 30,000 yuan. It was completed just one week ago, and the interior decoration was also about to be completed. Unexpectedly, at around 10:00 AM yesterday, while the staff of the hall were supervising workers to arrange and clean everything, a sound was suddenly heard from the edge of the building, and white powder and cement fell down. The walls on both sides also shook suddenly, threatening to collapse. The workers, seeing this, knew things were not good and wanted to run away, but it was too late. With a crash, the entire building of the hall collapsed completely, shocking the neighbors, who thought it was a thunderclap from a clear sky and were terrified. Fortunately, nearby police officers arrived at the scene immediately after hearing the sound and immediately notified the Fire Brigade, urgently dispatching firefighters and ambulances to the scene of the accident to provide rescue. The police station in charge also sent a senior police officer to the scene to maintain order. After an hour of hard work by the firefighters, all the workers were rescued from the rubble. A total of eleven people were injured, including seven Japanese, of whom Ishizuka Shiro, Saemon, and Ikeda Shigezo were the most seriously injured, with their left and right leg bones broken. They are now being treated at Fumin Hospital. Takahashi Umeji, Asami Kichi, Ishii Kiichiro, Sekiguchi Kenji, and Shibazaki Fukuji were also injured in the waist and chest, but not seriously, so they were discharged from the hospital after treatment. Four Chinese, named Lu Linquan, Gao Zhaosheng, Xu Jinzi, and Ding Zhende, were all injured in the feet, also very slightly, so they were also discharged from the hospital after bandaging.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Dai Ji'en Accused of Perjury</h3>
<p>Yesterday Under Investigation by the Special Court Prosecutor's Office</p>
<p>A man named Zhou Dongshan previously deposited money in the Xieshun Foreign Firm. Later, due to a dispute, Zhou filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court against Zhang Zhaosun, a partner in the Xieshun Foreign Firm. As a result, Zhang lost the case and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, which also failed. During the first and second trials, lawyer Dai Ji'en, who had drafted the contract between Xieshun Foreign Firm and Zhang Zhaosun, was summoned to testify. Because lawyer Dai's testimony in the second trial was slightly unfavorable to Zhang, causing him to lose the case, he filed a complaint with the prosecutor's office of the First Special Court, accusing lawyer Dai of perjury, claiming that he was not actually a partner in the Xieshun Foreign Firm, while lawyer Dai had testified that he was a partner, which was perjury. The prosecutor's office of the Special Court, under prosecutor Song Genshan, opened a hearing yesterday afternoon to investigate. Lawyer Dai, accompanied by his defense lawyer Shan Yuhua, appeared in court. According to lawyer Dai's testimony, when the Second Branch of the High Court summoned me to testify, I testified that I had drafted a contract between Xieshun Foreign Firm and Zhang Zhaosun, but I did not state that the contract was a partnership contract. The court believed that it was a partnership contract, but that was not my responsibility. Prosecutor Song then questioned Zhang Zhaosun, instructed lawyer Dai to leave, and said the matter would be reviewed.</p>
<h3>Xu Jingmian Sues Gu Yubo for Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Daxin Bank Never Opened, Half of the Stock Money Never Returned</p>
<p>The Meihua Bank at 230 Jiujiang Road, which had only been open for less than a month, recently announced liquidation. It was found that the Meihua Bank was opened in conjunction with the Daxin Industrial Bank, which was in preparation, with Gu Yubo as the manager. Recently, Gu Yubo was sued by Xu Jingmian, who retained a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing him of fraud and embezzlement, violating Article 335 of the Criminal Code. The gist of the indictment stated that in October 1934, the defendant Gu Yubo told the plaintiff that he intended to open the Daxin Industrial Bank and asked the plaintiff to invest in shares. The plaintiff then paid 3,000 yuan for shares, for which Gu issued a receipt. Unexpectedly, more than a year later, not only had the Daxin Bank not opened, but also the license from the Ministry of Finance had not been obtained. After several negotiations, only 1,500 yuan was returned, and half of the money remained outstanding, so he filed the lawsuit. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan presided over the trial in the Ninth Criminal Court. The defendant did not appear. According to a report from bailiff number 2707, it was found that number 230 Jiujiang Road was the Meihua Bank, and it had already closed, so no one received the summons. The court ordered that the case be rescheduled for review.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Fire, Large Quantity of Drugs Seized</h3>
<p>All Prohibited Items Such as Morphine and Alcohol</p>
<p>Escort Seized the Opportunity to Flee After the Incident</p>
<p>At 8:15 PM on the 1st of this month, rickshaw puller Wang Liuhu was pulling an empty rickshaw, number 6845, on Connaught Road. A man in a black robe hired the rickshaw, and when they reached the stove shed at number 400 Connaught Road, he loaded the iron cans and other items onto the rickshaw and asked Wang to take him to Seymour Road. Unexpectedly, when the rickshaw reached Seymour Road, the items loaded on the rickshaw, which were all alcohol and other drugs, caught fire for unknown reasons, and flames suddenly spread everywhere. Passersby Li Shaorong and Chen Hezhong stepped forward to help put out the fire. Unfortunately, Li was careless and his clothes were burned, causing burns to both legs. Fortunately, Chen Hezhong tried his best to extinguish the fire, and the man seized the opportunity to escape. Two Chinese constables, numbers 1628 and 2856, saw this and took Li, Chen, and rickshaw puller Wang Liuhu, along with the rickshaw, to the Gordon Road police station. They ordered Li Shaorong to be sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. Meanwhile, Chinese and Western detectives investigated the items on the rickshaw, which were all prohibited drugs, including a large white leather suitcase, three cans of alcohol, one can of yellow liquid, one can of Texaco engine oil, half a bottle of chemicals, five bottles of ammonia, five taels of morphine material, three and a half taels of heroin with paper, one bag of white powder, three bottles of chemical mixture, as well as funnels, tire pumps, and glass bottles. Wang Liuhu and others were questioned, and the police went to number 400 Connaught Road to investigate. According to the second landlord, surnamed Tao, the stove shed was rented by a Cantonese man, but judging by its appearance, the place did not seem to be a manufacturing site, but a storage place. The Cantonese man had also fled without a trace. Only some medicinal materials and liquids were seized in the room and brought back to the police station. Yesterday morning, the police sent the seized items to the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin presented the facts and requested a ruling. Judge Liu ordered that all the seized items be confiscated according to the list.</p>
<h3>Zhang Quanfa Accused of Disrupting Family</h3>
<p>Seducing and Cohabiting with a Young Girl, Failing to Fulfill Marriage Promise</p>
<p>Jin Xiaomei, also known as Juying, a woman from Changzhou residing at number 95, Yuxing Lane, Zhangjia Hong, is nineteen years old this year. Recently, her mother, Jin Yang, 55 years old, as her legal representative, retained a lawyer to file a criminal suit in the Second Special Court against local resident Zhang Quanfa, 25 years old, (residing at number 8, Jianxin Lane, intersection of Kangdi Road and Malone Road) for disrupting the family. The indictment stated that the plaintiff's daughter, Yu Xiaomei, came to Shanghai from the countryside and temporarily stayed at the home of her sister, Yao Jin. Unexpectedly, last year, the defendant Zhang Quanfa repeatedly enticed and forced her into illicit relations. Later, on February 8th of last year, they rented a stove room at number 69, Ronghua Lane, Malone Road, and cohabited as husband and wife. The plaintiff was constantly looking for her daughter without success. Later, Xiaomei returned home and told her the whole story. When the plaintiff confronted the defendant, the defendant admitted everything and stated that he had no wife and was willing to marry Xiaomei. He then took Xiaomei away and continued to cohabit with her, repeatedly delaying the marriage. Under these circumstances, the defendant has committed a crime under Section 3 of Article 240 of the Criminal Code, and the plaintiff requests that he be investigated and prosecuted according to law, and that he be compensated for the plaintiff's mental suffering in the amount of 1,000 yuan, and monthly support of 30 yuan, and Xiaomei's living expenses for three years, totaling 2,080 yuan. The court accepted the case and continued the hearing yesterday. First, the second landlord of number 69, Ronghua Lane, Mr. Changjiang, testified that Zhang Quanfa and Jin Xiaomei came together to rent the house on February 8th of last year. Zhang Quanfa stated that although he knew Jin Xiaomei, he had not had any physical relationship with her and had not rented a house with her. Jin Xiaomei stated that it was true that Zhang Quanfa and I went together to rent the Ronghua Lane house. Judge Sun ordered Zhang Quanfa to provide a shop guarantee to be released and adjourned the hearing to summon witnesses for further review.</p>

<h3>Supervisory Yuan Announces Luo Tong Bribery and Malfeasance Case, Transferred to the Disciplinary Committee for Punishment</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Supervisory Yuan recently announced the impeachment of Luo Tong, President of the Shanghai District Court, for bribery and malfeasance. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Supervisory Yuan Transfer and Handover</p>
<p>According to Jiangsu Supervisory District Supervisor Ding Chaowu, the case involved a presentation by Feng Qiuxin, representative of the Shanghai Nanshi Commercial Federation, accusing Luo Tong, President of the Shanghai District Court, Chief Prosecutor Zhong Bin, and others of selling official positions, dereliction of duty, and accepting bribes. This case was ordered to be investigated and handled in response to the Secretariat of the Yuan's secret document number 636, dated October 20, 1935. A complaint by Tang Yimin and others accusing Luo Tong, President of the Shanghai District Court, of bribery and malfeasance, was also ordered to be handled in response to the Secretariat of the Yuan's secret document number 742, dated October 30, 1935. In compliance, the cases were jointly sent to the Investigation Section Chief Huang Sen and Consultant Cai Hongtian of this office for investigation. According to the report, the office reviewed that Xu Jinqing, as the defendant in a criminal case, had already concluded the debate after a public trial and a date had been set for sentencing. Regardless of whether he was guilty or not, the president of the court should not have arbitrarily approved bail. Moreover, the approval of bail was not in accordance with normal procedures. Even if there was no concrete evidence of bribery, the impropriety was obvious. An impeachment should be initiated, and the case should be transferred to the court for investigation and punishment in accordance with the law, in order to warn officials against evil. The case was then handed over to Supervisory Committee members Wang Xianzhang, Duan Honggang, and Yao Yuping for review. According to the report, the committee members jointly reviewed and unanimously agreed that the president of the court, Luo Tong, handled the case of Xu Jinqing possessing firearms. The case was tried by Judge Cai Dincheng. The court session on May 16, 1935, concluded the debate and set the date for official judgment on the 20th of the same month. The defendant was returned to custody. Although Ren Jishou and others submitted a request for bail on the 17th of the same month, the court received the request on the morning of the 18th. President Luo Tong approved the bail for Xu Jinqing on the 17th. This indicated that there was no causal relationship between the bail and Ren Jishou's bail application. The president of the court sent the bail application to the presiding judge Cai Dincheng for review afterwards, but the defendant had already been released on bail. The president of the court interfered with the trial, arbitrarily approved the bail for the defendant, which was a clear violation of the provisions of the Litigation Law. The original accusation of bribery was not without cause. It was requested that Luo Tong, the President of the Shanghai District Court, be transferred to the disciplinary committee for punishment. Accordingly, copies of the documents are being sent to your committee for verification and handling. This is being transferred to the Central Public Servants Disciplinary Committee.</p>
<p>Impeachment Document from the Supervisor</p>
<p>According to the Secretariat of the Yuan's document number 636, dated October 22, 1935, President of the Yuan delegated to Supervisory Committee member Li Menggeng to sign, stating that Feng Qiuxin, representative of the Shanghai Nanshi Commercial Federation, accused Luo Tong, President of the Shanghai District Court, Chief Prosecutor Dun Shangbin, and others of selling official positions, dereliction of duty, and accepting bribes. After further review, it was requested that the Secretariat issue a letter to the Jiangsu Supervisory District Supervisor's Office to investigate and handle the case. The Secretariat was instructed to comply. Accordingly, copies of the documents were sent to your office for verification and handling, along with a copy of Feng Qiuxin's original petition. While the case was being reviewed, the Secretariat of the Yuan's document number 742, dated October 30, 1935, was received, stating that Supervisory Committee members Li Menggeng, Yang Pusheng, and Xiong Yuxi had signed a presentation stating that Tang Yimin and others from Shanghai County, Jiangsu, had telegraphed accusing Luo Tong, President of the Shanghai District Court, of bribery and malfeasance. After further review, it was found that the President and others had previously been accused by Feng Qiuxin of selling official positions, dereliction of duty, and accepting bribes. The Secretariat should issue another letter to the Supervisor to handle the cases concurrently. The Secretariat was instructed to comply. Accordingly, copies of the documents were sent to your office for verification and handling, along with a copy of the original telegram from Tang Yimin and others. Complying with this, the cases were jointly sent to the Investigation Section Chief Huang Sen and Consultant Cai Hongtian of this office for investigation. According to the report from the Section Chief, regarding the portion of Feng Qiuxin's petition: A) Bribery to release criminals: It was found that bailiffs Chen Zuosheng and Liu Wenbin, through common negligence, caused criminals to escape. They have each been fined ten yuan and dismissed from their positions. B) Dereliction of duty and acceptance of bribes: (A) In the case of Sun Shaoming and others for murder, Prosecutor Zhang Xiang initially believed that there was insufficient suspicion and prepared a decision not to prosecute, which was submitted to the Chief Prosecutor. The Chief Prosecutor, due to public outcry, believed that it was necessary to conduct a re-investigation and reassigned the case to prosecutors Xie Lian and Du Jiasheng for re-investigation and prosecution. The indictment was also submitted to the Ministry for review. The handling method was not inappropriate. (B) The debt case between Zhang Deming and Zhao Guanqing has already been investigated by Supervisory Committee members Tian and Zhu, and the files have been transferred to the court. Other points such as (employing private individuals), (selling official positions), (smoking opium), and (becoming wealthy through bribery) were not substantiated. Regarding the portion of Tang Yimin's petition: It was found that the telegraph accused President Luo Tong of bribery and malfeasance. Besides the two cases of Sun Shaoming and Zhao Guanqing mentioned above, the case of Xu Jinqing was tried by Judge Cai Dincheng, and the date for sentencing was set for October 20th. The court ordered Xu Jinqing to be returned to custody, which was recorded in the minutes. On the 17th of the same month, Ren Jishou and others submitted a bail application. The President of the court hastily approved it and then belatedly submitted a memo to the presiding judge for review. When the judge received the memo, Xu Jinqing had already been released on bail, as recorded by Cai Dincheng. It was also found that Ren Jishou and others' bail application was dated May 17th, while the date stamped on the application by the receiving office was 11:00 AM on the 18th. Xu's release on bail was still on the 17th. Examining the entire file, there was no release order or extradition warrant attached. This showed that the approval of bail was before the receipt of the application, and the illegal procedures for stopping detention were sufficient to prove the case. As for the claim in the original petition that he received a bribe of 5,000 yuan, although there was no concrete evidence, the circumstances of the President's handling of this case were not without suspicion. The above is the true situation of the investigation report in this case. This office reviewed that Xu Jinqing, as the defendant in a criminal case, had already announced the conclusion of the debate and set a date for judgment. Regardless of whether he was guilty or not, the President of the court should not have arbitrarily approved bail. Moreover, the approval of bail was not in accordance with normal procedures. Even if there was no concrete evidence of bribery, the impropriety was obvious. An impeachment should be initiated, and the case should be transferred to the court for investigation and punishment in accordance with the law, in order to warn officials against evil. All the reasons for entrusting the handling of the cases of Luo Tong, President of the Shanghai District Court, and Chief Prosecutor Zhong Shangbin, are presented in this document for the Yuan's consideration and implementation. Respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>Review Report</p>
<p>Review Report by Committee members Wang Xianzhang, Duan Honggang, and Yao Yuping: For the matter of the Review Report, the case of Jiangxu Supervisor Ding Chaowu impeaching President Luo Tong of the Shanghai Court for the crime of dereliction of duty and receiving bribes, was assigned to the committee. The committee together reviewed and agreed, that because Court President Luo Tong was responsible for the case of Xu Jinqing possessing guns and artillery, which was to be tried by Court President Cai Dincheng and came to the end of the debate and final judgement on the 16th day of the 5th month, and was scheduled for announcement on the 20th day of the same month, the defendant was kept in custody, and although there were the likes of Ren Jishou on the 17th day of the month submitting a request for release on bail, yet the Court did not receive it until the morning of the 18th, Court President Luo Tong's approval to release Xu Jinqing was given on the 17th, demonstrating that there was no correlation between the granting of bail and Ren Jishou's guarantee, Court President sent the bail to presiding Court President Cai Dincheng to review after the fact, yet the defendant had already been released on bail, Court President interfered with the review, and arbitrarily released the defendant on bail, demonstrably in violation of the law of procedure, the charge of receiving bribes is not without cause, and that it should be requested that Court President Luo Tong be given over for discplinary action, to protect the law. Respectfully Submitted,</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Having read today's news in your newspaper under "Nanhua Shipping Plummets," I noticed a section on "private sugar affecting national sugar" which seems to be inconsistent with the facts. After investigation, the dumping of private sugar is only happening currently in Northern and Southern China. In Shanghai, because we have been offering rewards to encourage reports of this and have been extremely strict, there has been no private sugar coming to Shanghai. The slow sales of Guangdong sugar are due to a false rumor in a Japanese newspaper that sugar taxes would be reduced. Recently, we have had earnest statements from financial authorities that there will be no reduction in sugar taxes. Sugar merchants should be at ease. Sales will soon be brisk. Also, the price of Guangdong sugar is absolutely not as cheap or in decline as your paper has written. Currently, the market price for Guangdong Class 5 Coarse White Granulated Sugar is 21 yuan and 8 jiao per dan, Medium White 19 yuan and 9 jiao, Number 2 Cotton White 20 yuan and 8 jiao, Number 4 Cotton White 20 yuan and 6 jiao. All newspaper economic columns have carried these prices. I humbly ask for a correction to be printed, so that the truth may be known.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Shanghai Sugar Trade Association, May 5th, to the Chief Editor of the Editorial Department of the Shen Bao Newspaper</p>
<p>Acknowledgment:</p>
<p>We received the 1936 "China Credit Information Agency Shanghai Business Directory" and the Bank Weekly issue 948 from the Bank Weekly Office. Thank you.</p>

<h3>The Importance of the Three Transformations Plan</h3>
<p>— Qi Wenli</p>
<p>There are three essential elements for establishing a nation: the people, the land, and sovereignty. The people are the main body of all cultural and political activities. The excellence or inferiority of politics and the height or lowness of culture are all manifested through the spiritual and material strength of life. If life is morbid, politics and culture will inevitably be affected. As the Premier Sun Yat-sen said, "A nation is an accumulation of people, people are the instruments of the heart, and national affairs are psychological phenomena of the people. Therefore, the rise and fall of politics depend on the spirit of the people." Today, our country's external troubles are becoming increasingly urgent, and the morbid state of society is exposed before our eyes. In the past, many movements occurred, often neglecting the activities of the entire nation and only confined to one corner. Humans are naturally children of nature, and the country and society are the collective of humans. All human activities directly affect society and the country. Therefore, if we want to talk about saving the country, we must first give the people's lives a standard direction so that we can create a trend and shape the world. This is the purpose of the New Life Movement, and therefore a movement to save the country. The initial work of the New Life Movement lies in the universal implementation of "propriety" and "cleanliness" by the people. However, the highest goal of the New Life Movement is definitely not limited to this. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek clearly stated in the handwritten New Life Outline: "How can the lives of the people be made noble? By making life artistic. How can the lives of the people be made wealthy? By making life productive. How can the lives of the people be made strong? By making life militarized." Making life artistic can correct foolishness and increase wisdom; making life productive can relieve poverty and be benevolent; making life militarized can arouse weakness and create courage. Therefore, the three transformations plan is fully consistent with the Premier's teachings of education, nurture, and defense. Its importance is evident. Now, let's discuss them separately:</p>
<p>1.  Making Life Militarized: Our country is a nation of culture, always boasting of its literary achievements. The Ming Dynasty used literary arts for governance, and the Qing Dynasty continued this practice, confining people's thoughts and depleting their spirits. They spent their years under the window with pen and ink. Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty regarded this as a successful strategy, saying, "All the sons of the world are in my control." Little did he know that the poison spread so widely. The Japanese often refer to our country as "China, the country of special characters." A nation's survival in the world depends on military strength, as Bismarck said, "There is no such thing as justice in the world, no such thing as public law; it is iron and blood." Weak scholars sitting and talking about governing the country are not yet capable, let alone defending the country? Today, with strong neighbors pressing our borders, the situation is critical, and we cannot afford to be complacent, scattered, cowardly, decadent. Therefore, militarizing the lives of the entire nation is an urgent matter. "The so-called militarization of life does not mean that all compatriots across the country should be fully armed and go to the battlefield together. It only requires them to value organization, emphasize unity, be strict in discipline, abide by order, know how to be invigorated, and maintain seriousness, selecting the previous habits of being scattered, shirking responsibility, procrastinating, and being perfunctory." The main methods for training the people include training male and female citizens, training strong men, training district chiefs and Baojia chiefs, military education for students, and air defense drills. Moreover, modern warfare is not fragmentary or simple, but three-dimensional and holistic. Mobilization is the mobilization of the people, and combat weapons are based on advanced scientific civilization. If China does not want to survive, then so be it. Otherwise, we must painfully correct the weaknesses in history, promote scientific education, and popularize military knowledge. Bismarck's unification of Germany was achieved through national military education, which can be a lesson for us to learn.</p>
<p>2.  Making Life Productive: The increase in a country's wealth depends first on the productivity of the country and individuals, and second on the proportion of producers to non-producers. Without productivity, it is not enough to talk about wealth. If there are too few producers, it is also not enough to talk about wealth. The Great Learning says, "There is a great way to produce wealth. Let those who produce be many, and those who consume be few; let those who make it be diligent, and those who use it be frugal, then wealth will always be sufficient." Guanzi said, "If there is much grassland and little cultivated land, even without floods or droughts, the fields of the country will be hungry." In ancient times, in the agricultural era, the relationship between the economy and the national lifeline was already like this, let alone in modern financial society?</p>
<p>At this time of national crisis, one person should do the work of two people, and two people should produce the output of two people. Those without productive capacity should strive to be frugal, reduce waste, and save material resources to meet urgent needs. If we look at the national power of Japan, it is so prosperous because the daily lives of the people consist of only a small dish of pickles and a small piece of salted fish, using the surplus funds to complete its annual military budget of 200 million yen. The national power of Soviet Russia is so rapidly advancing, also through frugal consumption, eating only black bread and wearing only coarse wool, using the savings to complete its successive five-year plans. Therefore, today, the productive movement in our country, in the active aspect, should develop labor services, and in the passive aspect, should promote domestic goods and advocate thrift, to respond to the national crisis and relieve the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>3.  Making Life Artistic: What is art? How can it be called an artistic life? This is what we need to give a correct answer to. The essence of art is beauty, and the meaning of beauty is that it can make people feel happy. Therefore, "the pleasure of beauty" is the essence and meaning of art. The so-called artistic life means that we want our daily lives to be full of "the pleasure of beauty." In other words, it is to feel interesting in life. However, to achieve this goal, the individual must first have artistic cultivation in their heart. Art is absolutely different from romance. It is not like poets, painters, and musicians, barefoot and open-collared, unconstrained by trivialities, and appreciating the romantic charm. As Tao Kan said, "A gentleman should straighten his clothes and hat, respect his appearance, how can he have disheveled hair and bare feet, and call himself a detached person?" As for the general perception that artistic life is only for the leisure class, and that those who are busy with food, clothing, and shelter all day long have no right to enter the realm of art, this is even more of a misunderstanding. Art can make up for the shortcomings of life and save the suffering of life. In the universe, every grass and tree contains artistic meaning. As Su Dongpo said, "Like the clear breeze on the river and the bright moon in the mountains, the ear hears it and becomes sound, the eye encounters it and becomes color, taking it endlessly and using it inexhaustibly, it is the endless treasure of the Creator between heaven and earth." As long as the individual has artistic cultivation, they can naturally understand the interest in everything in society, and all dry, cruel, deceitful, cunning, base, and perfunctory phenomena will not easily occur. Therefore, if we want to change our boring life in our spare time and spare time, then we rely on the art of life.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the New Life Movement is an endless movement. The above is said specifically in terms of facts that are compelling and necessary. As the times advance, needs also advance, and the goals of the New Life Movement also advance with them. The New Life Movement is truly a standard for this time and this place, and a yardstick for theory. To fulfill the mission of this era depends on how the people work hard to make a judgment.</p>

<h3>Lei Zhen Speaks on "Nation and Culture" (Part 2)</h3>
<p>In conclusion, the ties of historical tradition are the bonds that unite a nation. Blood ties are inherently traditional and need no further discussion. The location of ancestral tombs naturally evokes deep concern. Culture, due to tradition, is most capable of inspiring endless admiration. Therefore, the establishment of a nation is based on its shared traditions, while the separation of peoples is due to their respective historical backgrounds. Hence, to promote national spirit and enhance national consciousness, there is no way other than through history. The most intense events of past national struggles, the common honors and grievances of history, should be made into popular songs, dramas, and films, so that strong emotions are naturally rooted in people's hearts. The historical figures who fought to resist enemies and defend the nation should have their historical deeds and biographies expressed and promoted as examples for future generations to admire and emulate. This is indeed the key to national revival.</p>
<p>It is a natural feeling for a nation to cherish tradition based on historical culture. However, this does not mean advocating for a return to the past and rejecting foreign cultures. Looking at Chinese history since the Han Dynasty, the adoption of foreign music, skills, medical arts, and even the large-scale propagation of Buddhism and translation of Buddhist scriptures have enriched and diversified the thoughts and lives of the people. Recently, contact with the West has also led to the acceptance of Western culture to a point of fluency without being perceived as foreign. Culture is about absorption and progress. Today, China needs to absorb Western culture to assimilate and enrich itself. However, there must be a certain purpose and a firmly established center to benefit our nation. Secondly, a largely similar lifestyle is an important factor for a nation. The "Doctrine of the Mean" says, "Conduct is the same," referring to what sociologists call "patterning." For example, traditional Chinese weddings, from betrothal to asking the name, all have certain forms. Although there may be minor differences in various places, they still share a common ground. Recent new-style weddings, however, vary from person to person and have not yet been standardized. The Ministry of Interior should issue a general order to unify them. However, rituals are ultimately minor matters. As for morality, the issue becomes serious. In the past, teaching loyalty and filial piety had no regional or class distinctions. In fact, the extent to which it was practiced varied from person to person, but in theory, everyone's conscience agreed with it. Now, however, it is not the same. Taking the family system as an example, should we maintain the inherited family system to resist foreign ideas of freedom, or should we reform the system to adapt to the new environment? Or is this system fundamentally undesirable and should be destroyed as soon as possible? All three of these views are supported by some in their conscience. However, the Westernization of the country is currently the dominant consciousness. Being able to learn the Western lifestyle is fashionable and upper-class, while others are merely middle-class or lower. However, to completely transplant the Western lifestyle, there are many insufficient conditions. Only a very small number of people can achieve a thorough Westernization in clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Most people are out of reach. Therefore, many inappropriate and non-standard practices appear in society. The same is true in terms of morality. Now, considering only freedom and responsibility, Westerners love freedom and strive for freedom, and they also take full responsibility for their actions, never shirking it. Nowadays, Chinese people on the one hand strive for freedom, but once freedom is obtained, they often do not take responsibility. On the other hand, they want people to take responsibility, but they interfere in many ways and do not give them freedom. Therefore, when there is profit to be gained, everyone competes for it, but when there is no credit to be given, they shirk responsibility from each other, and everything is not done because of this. Now, to seek the revival of the nation, we must establish good social institutions. For example, if we want someone to take responsibility, we must give him freedom of action. If we do not give him freedom, then we do not ask for his responsibility. If all kinds of systems have definite forms, then all actions will have something to follow, and the goal of "conduct being the same" can be achieved, and the meaning of the nation can become stronger.</p>
<p>If we go a step further and ask what determines lifestyle, it is another difficult question. There are many possible answers. Now, let's just mention its work and discuss it. According to the materialistic historical view, all lifestyles are determined by economics. However, the relationship between the formation of a nation and economics is minimal. Economics is a universal thing, while the reason why nations are opposed to each other lies in their particularity. Economic interests are linked globally, while nations build their walls firmly. As long as the level of culture is not drastically different, learning the economic life of other nations is very easy. Today, not only are the economic structures of European countries roughly the same, with Soviet Russia in the last ten years or so being the only exception, but also the civilized countries of the world are not much different. Why can't the various nations of today merge into one? The second answer is politics. The Grand Historian Sima Qian said that it was only after Emperor Qin unified the standards of dress and customs that the ideal of "conduct being the same" could be realized. Blood mixing, cultural blending, and shared historical destiny can only be achieved under the unification of the state. However, once a ruling class is established within a country, its lifestyle will inevitably stand in a dominant position and gradually spread to the lower classes. Although the role of economics has a secret activity, it is actually less crucial than the organization of politics. Therefore, a nation must not lose its political freedom and be destroyed, even to the point of extinction. However, the role of politics cannot shape a nation overnight; it must go through a long period of governance to succeed. However, if the role of politics is lax and weak, then the inherent national character will continue to disappear, and there can be no talk of enhancing its unity. This can be asserted.

<h3>Overview of the German School in Shanghai (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>3.  School Buildings and Facilities</p>
<p>The school building is very grand and has novel architecture. The school building is W-shaped, with a six-story building in the middle and two four-story buildings on each side. The entire school occupies more than ten acres and has convenient transportation. The kindergarten and elementary school classrooms, as well as the principal's and teachers' offices, are located on the ground floor. The secondary school classrooms for each grade and subject, as well as the auditorium, are located on the second and third floors. In total, there are twelve regular classrooms, as well as special classrooms such as physics and chemistry laboratories, a library, an art room, an auditorium, and a gymnasium (combined with the auditorium). Other facilities such as coatrooms, drinking fountains, male and female restrooms, a sports field, and a campus are all available. All classrooms use steel windows, which provide ample light. The kindergarten also has a glass room with long glass windows on three sides. When the weather is fine, children can play in it and get plenty of sunlight. When the weather is cold, the room is heated with hot water radiators, so children can play in it without getting cold. All classrooms in the school are connected to radiators, which is a hygienic and clean way to heat. The rooms on the fourth, fifth, and sixth floors are used for the principal's and teachers' accommodations. A portion of the rooms is also used as the office of the German chapel pastor and the German expatriate community organization in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In terms of equipment, the school is also well-equipped. Upon entering the school gate, there are two huge models of trains and ships in the corridors on both sides, which can inspire children's scientific thinking. Most of the desks and chairs in the classrooms are German-style double desks, which are not easy to move. The classrooms also have considerable decorations. The physics and chemistry instruments and specimens are quite rich. The physics room has a German-made Epidia skop brand medium-sized projector, worth 250 yuan in national currency. The projector has three uses: It can project transparent glass slides; it can project various specimens and charts from books; and it can also project short films using a small attachment head. The projector is a recent German invention and manufacture (sold by the Lihe Foreign Company on Sichuan Road in this city) and is of great help in science and history teaching.</p>

<p>Shen Bao National Goods Special Issue</p>
<h3>The Lifeline of National Goods</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Smuggling in North China is rampant, foreign goods are dumped continuously, and the life of national goods is hanging by a thread. How can the country survive and gain a foothold? Besides seeking new paths through self-reliance and leaving a lifeline for the few remaining national goods, it depends on the government's practical help. For the national goods industry in any country in the world is backed by the government. If the government is unwilling to help national goods factories, what hope is there for the national goods industry?</p>
<p>I believe that the government has many undertakings and numerous institutions, and the amount of national goods used each year is considerable. If the government only uses national goods for procurement, becoming a major customer of the national goods industry, then the national goods industry will at least have a new path to survival, enough to reverse the depressed situation.</p>
<p>Recently, the government's promotion of national goods seems to be more enthusiastic and practical than in the past. For example, clothing is mostly made of domestic products; transportation and railways purchase domestic materials; the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has repeatedly sent personnel to investigate the national goods industry; and providing strong support, the gloom and doom of our national goods industry has slightly dissipated, revealing a glimmer of hope. But I still cannot help but speak out: for example, the nitric acid produced by the Tianli Factory, operated by Mr. Wu Yun, is indeed excellent, but there are still few users. Therefore, for the sake of Mr. Wu, we should vigorously promote and conduct various tests to strengthen users' confidence, so that the hard work will sooner or later be recognized. In addition, national goods factories similar to Mr. Wu's should work hard to improve so that the country can purchase materials without having to seek them from abroad, and everything can be self-sufficient. Then the lifeline of China's national goods industry can not only be maintained, but there may also be a day when a new path is opened up.</p>
<h3>From National Goods to National Wealth</h3>
<p>— Da Wen</p>
<p>Indeed, this is a matter worth celebrating for the national goods industry!</p>
<p>In recent years, the psychology of our people in using national goods has gradually entered a deeper level of usage habits, and the ladies who have always aimed at using imported goods have also gradually been influenced to use national goods.</p>
<p>The success is due, on the one hand, to the efforts of national goods manufacturers to produce goods, carefully study the beauty of materials, and make prices affordable, more durable than any imported goods. As a result, sales have increased year after year, day after day, causing a major blow to imported goods and a major loss to foreign merchants. This is a matter that is so commendable and gratifying!</p>
<p>But on the other hand, we must also give credit to the propaganda of various commercial leaders and newspapers and publications, which constantly imprinted the four characters "use national goods" in the minds of the people. At the same time, various national goods movement and national goods exhibitions were held to vigorously promote national goods. These are all major tasks that are closely related to the future of national goods.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, the use of national goods does not need to be promoted. We should all use national goods and fulfill our national duties. Whether it is clothing, food, housing, or transportation, we should give priority to using national goods, so that national goods will naturally sell well.</p>
<p>Once national goods can sell well throughout the country and the people can fulfill their national duties, with everyone having the psychology of using national goods, we can see that the future of national goods is limitless, and our country's financial resources will never flow out of the country.</p>
<p>The ambitions of imperialist capitalist systems do not hesitate to invest huge amounts of money in trade with China, implementing economic aggression to oppress us, so that our goods cannot be developed as much as possible, and our industry and commerce are forever bound and backward. If we do not actively prepare ourselves to create and invent, and use the industrial and commercial power of the masses to resist the oppression of imperialist industry and commerce, I am afraid that in the near future, imperialism will seize economic power to block us.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to make the country rich, we must first prevent money from flowing out of the country. To prevent money from flowing out of the country, we must use national goods. If we calculate the results of using national goods based on the number of 480 million compatriots in our country, this is probably a number that no country in the world can match! If this kind of national automatic adoption of national goods method can be realized, what fear is there that the country will not be rich?</p>
<p>A country that does not suffer from a lack of financial resources is "national wealth." In other words, the country has money. Once the country is rich, are we still afraid that the country will not be strong?</p>
<p>Therefore, from the perspective of ordinary poor people, buying foreign goods is entirely due to the wealthy people. They wear Western suits, eat Western food, live in Western houses, and ride in cars. Their clothing, food, housing, and transportation are all purchased from abroad. It is a huge drain, which we poor people do not need to recover. We do not need to spend a penny to buy foreign goods for our daily necessities. This understanding is considered the most reasonable.</p>
<p>We now most desire two methods to enable national goods to achieve the goal of being popular everywhere, as follows:</p>
<p>National goods manufacturers across the country should actively research and manufacture machinery and materials, and use various scientific methods to prevent domestic products from relying on foreign machinery. At the same time, attention should be paid to the actual improvement of materials and raw materials in all aspects. Do not repackage foreign goods. Products should be produced quickly, prices should be low, goods should be durable, and they should not be crudely made. So that domestic can first have the belief of using, so that we can eliminate the concept that "foreign goods are expensive, but the quality is ultimately strong."</p>
<p>We should request the government to reduce or exempt taxes on domestic and export goods, so that national goods can reduce costs and the capital of national goods manufacturers can flow easily. Then, the inevitable increase in production is sufficient to resist the threat of imported goods. In addition, the cost of national goods manufacturers is reduced, and the price will not be expensive, so people can be happy to buy them.</p>
<p>The above two reasons and hopes are closely related to the interests of the future of national goods, so it is appropriate to find ways to implement them. However, if we want a country to be economically wealthy and not leak out of the country, we must first start by purchasing and using national goods completely. Can achieve the position of national wealth and strength, it is better to study the actual than to shout slogans. If it is not done as described above, perhaps the sales of imported goods can never be overcome, national goods will never have the prospect of development, and the weakness of the national purchasing power of domestic goods can also be imagined. Then, the fundamental law of national wealth and strength is also forever vague.</p>
<h3>Please Use National Goods for Stationery and Envelopes</h3>
<p>— Lan Shan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Party Department recently received an order to inform all levels of party departments that "hereinafter, the printing paper, stationery, and envelopes used by the Central and all levels of party departments must be based on national goods as the standard. If foreign paper is purchased again, the responsible personnel shall be punished." This is a matter of no small importance.</p>
<p>It is found that many government agencies use foreign paper to print stationery and envelopes, probably because they find it modern and beautiful? But think about it, how many letters do each agency send out every day? This is certainly not a small number! Chinese paper is not inferior to foreign goods, so why should we abandon national goods and not use them, and insist on purchasing batches of foreign paper to make stationery and envelopes? Now that the Central Executive Committee has this ban, I sincerely hope that all agencies across the country will follow it, in order to promote and emphasize national goods. Those who have purchased and stored unused foreign paper stationery and envelopes should also stop adding them after they have been used up, and switch to various suitable domestic papers.</p>
<p>As for young men and women, during the period of first love, either separated by thousands of miles, longing for each other, or seeing each other every day, but not being able to express themselves fully in person, they rely on the exchange of love letters to convey their feelings. However, according to the author's observation, almost nine out of ten of these love letters are written on foreign stationery and sealed with beautiful foreign-style envelopes, which is also a disadvantage for national goods. I hope that many dear brothers and sisters will also take patriotism into consideration when writing love letters in the future and no longer use foreign paper. China has many good stationery and envelopes, and their beauty and cleanliness are no less than foreign stationery, so they can be used greatly. I will use an old saying here, "Do not forget to save the country in love, and do not forget to love in saving the country," to wish all young friends. Then the future of national paper will be fortunate, and the achievements of your love will surely have the hope of success.</p>
<h3>Promoting National Goods Should Start with Children</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Although promoting national goods is the natural duty and obligation of everyone, in my opinion, if we want to achieve the permanent effect of promoting national goods and build the fundamental foundation of promoting national goods, we must also put in a lot of effort in the area of children. We must make children develop the habit of using national goods and the psychology of being ashamed of using foreign goods. Being able to achieve this point is our most far-reaching goal in promoting national goods.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is undeniable that children's minds are very pure; children's emotions are very enthusiastic; and children's patriotism is much higher than that of ordinary people. We must not underestimate the status of children, and we must not despise children's personality. We must know that training them to use national goods is actually more effective than publicizing it to the masses. This work is something that school teachers who are responsible for educating children and children's parents must not ignore.</p>
<p>I remember reading a passage in a certain publication that the world's countries attach great importance to encouraging children to use domestic goods. They often incorporate "being ashamed of using foreign goods" or "slogans for using domestic goods" into textbooks. At the same time, they also make signs and post them on thoroughfares to attract children's attention, which is quite effective. Here are a few examples of slogans:</p>
<p>Japan: Children! Do not use foreign goods, do not wear foreign cloth, do not eat foreign things, Japanese goods are the best, this is the way to be a good student.</p>
<p>Russia: Those who do not use Russian goods are unpromising and unpatriotic slaves.</p>
<p>Germany: Children! Are your clothes, pencils, and paper notebooks foreign goods? Please check!</p>
<p>Other countries such as the United States, Britain, and Italy also have slogans that attract children to use domestic goods, which are posted in places where pedestrians pay attention. Due to space limitations, I will not go into more detail.</p>
<p>In short, children are the lifeblood of the country and the masters of the future. If we want to make the promotion of national goods a great success once and for all, then training children to use national goods is indeed a matter that brooks no delay.</p>
<h3>The Situation of the Youth National Goods Promotion Group in Wu</h3>
<p>— Yun Xun</p>
<p>We have long had this suggestion: that the national goods promotion movement not be limited to the five million people in Shanghai or the tens of thousands of people in other major cities, but be extended to every county and promoted to the lower classes! This is to ensure that both major thoroughfares and winding paths are reached. How do we open up these major thoroughfares and winding paths? On the one hand, we naturally rely on written propaganda, but on the other hand, we need mouths and hands: mouths to explain and hands to work. For example, notices posted in government offices can only be read by those who are literate. Scholars and officials can promote national goods through written propaganda, but they cannot reach the illiterate common people. Therefore, peddlers and laborers need practical encouragement. Young patriots like Liang Tongfang and others, based on their patriotic enthusiasm, organized the China Youth National Goods Promotion Group to travel to the inland provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei to implement their promotion policies. They received the sympathy and support of leaders of industry and commerce in Shanghai, such as Pan Yangyao and other gentlemen, and set off at the end of last month. Now, the group has stayed in Huaining and sent a brief report on their work in Wuhu to Shanghai. Their sample exhibition room was located in the Provincial Second Public Education Center. They attended a youth association concert where group member Fan Renliang gave a speech on saving the country with national goods. They held two discussion meetings at the Chamber of Commerce to exchange views with industry and commerce representatives on the development of industry and commerce. A total of 2,036 people visited the four sample exhibitions, including two Japanese businessmen, Kita Jushuo. They said in their report, "The county party headquarters turned a deaf ear to the national goods movement, and we repeatedly sought meetings without success." They were also given the runaround at the county government. I think it is not surprising that they met with rebuffs, which shows that the concept of promoting national goods is superficial in the inland. The group's work to promote national goods is urgent! Their accommodation is wherever they can find a place, not in hotels. It is as if they have returned to the nomadic life of primitive times, here today, there tomorrow. I admire the group's ability to endure hardship. Finally, I will copy a section on the survey of industry and commerce and special products. Industry and commerce: one electric company, one flour company, one oil pressing factory, one lime mine, two coal mines. Special products: iron flowers and rattan pillows, all handicrafts. Iron flowers are exported annually and sold in large quantities, but in recent years most of the raw materials are foreign iron. Rattan pillows are used in summer and are mostly made by women and children. As for education, transportation, and society, because they are less related to national goods, I will not list them one by one.</p>
<p>Notice: To Messrs. Xuan Wan, Fear Not Hall Owner, Shou Qiu, Yi Lu, Hui Zi, Ying, Meng Zhao, Xin Xiu, Jiang Tao, Ba Ling, Er Yu, Zi Xi, Thank you for your submissions in April. The royalties have now been calculated. Please prepare a receipt with a stamp and collect it from the accounting department of this newspaper between 2 PM and 4 PM on the 6th to 10th and 16th to 20th of this month (excluding Sundays). Sincerely, The National Goods Special Issue Department of Shen Bao</p>

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Da Mu)</p>
<p>To release the power of steam from water, the water must be heated to a temperature of 212 degrees. 200 degrees is not enough, and 210 degrees will not do. It must boil before it can release steam to turn machines and trains. Currently, many young people are using lukewarm water, or water that is about to boil but hasn't, to propel the trains of their lives. At the same time, they are surprised that their careers cannot surge forward.</p>
<p>A learned doctor said, "To enjoy a long life, one must keep the brain constantly active, except during sleep, and find a legitimate hobby outside of one's profession. One's profession provides a means of livelihood, while a hobby provides interest. 'Action' is equivalent to 'life,' and 'stillness' is equivalent to 'death'!" There is reason in his words.</p>
<p>It is easy to do what we enjoy doing, what we like and feel passionate about. However, to focus all our attention on doing something unpleasant, annoying, and opposed by our inner selves, while at the same time having to do it for unavoidable reasons, requires extraordinary courage and patience. Identifying a grand goal and persevering in a seemingly dull position with all our strength is the spirit of a hero, unattainable by ordinary people.</p>
<h3>The Jar for Hiding Royalties</h3>
<p>— Shi Jiu</p>
<p>It is difficult for writers to sell their work. It is deeply painful to have royalties stolen. A friend of mine unfortunately suffered this misfortune.</p>
<p>When that friend was a schoolteacher, even after all the deductions, his income was barely enough to make ends meet. He had no money for his own books, socializing, or entertainment. Not only was this true for my friend, but it was probably the case for countless others in the same boat. Fortunately, he could write, so during the day he wiped blackboards and inhaled chalk dust, and at night he burned the midnight oil, writing in the hopes of earning some extra money. His wife often urged him to sleep, but he always cleverly said, "I'm compiling lecture notes." In this way, he deceived his wife, because she was illiterate.</p>
<p>Over time, he actually accumulated a sum of money. He was overjoyed because his personal finances were now under his control, and he no longer had to rely on his wife, avoiding the feeling of "snatching loach from a cat's mouth"! However, how to properly hide this "private fund" was a major problem. At first, he hesitated for a long time, but later he found a "safe deposit box" and hid all his "private funds" in it.</p>
<p>What was this "safe deposit box"? Amusingly, it was a dusty jar covered in cobwebs in the back room! This jar was quite loyal to its owner, fulfilling its duties and safeguarding the money without taking a cut. So, whenever its master was in the back room chatting with his wife, it couldn't help but smile secretly, and he would give it a look of respect.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, misfortune struck. One night, his house was broken into by burglars who dug a tunnel. The loss was minimal, and his wife could take some comfort in that. However, unfortunately, his "private funds" had vanished. Afterwards, he secretly opened the jar, lamented his fate, and could only say with a wry smile, "Well, this is quite the elegant affair!"</p>
<p>To my fellow writers who sell their work: Why not "store the manuscripts carefully in a cabinet"!</p>
<h3>Forbidden Mountain</h3>
<p>— Zhu Shaofei</p>
<p>The leaves on the mulberry branches are now the size of copper coins, the loquats are starting to turn green, and the tender thatch has grown past our ankles. On the wall by the street, the yellow paper notice that reads: "This village will hold a Mountain Prohibition Meeting on × month × day" has been posted again.</p>
<p>The Mountain Prohibition is an old custom held annually by villagers in every village in "East Mountain," my hometown. To prevent petty theft of fruit trees and the cutting of other people's green thatch for sheep feed, all the villagers must contribute several hundred cash to the meeting, in exchange for a day of wine, meat, and rice. At the same time, the Fierce General Hall posts the annual copy of the Mountain Prohibition Rules, such as a fine of ten bronze gongs for picking one loquat, several banners and parasols for one pound of mulberry leaves, etc. Even close brothers who have separated their families must publicly discuss the fine if they are caught. The fines go to the Fierce General Society, and those who are fined are never allowed to join the Mountain Prohibition Meeting again.</p>
<p>The sound of the bronze gong reaches our alley in waves. Tomorrow is another Mountain Prohibition day. None of my four brothers are allowed to participate in the Mountain Prohibition Meeting. It has been more than ten years since we last participated, because when our father was alive, he picked the wrong loquat in our separated elder uncle's orchard, and was reported by our uncle and fined ten gongs. Our membership was permanently cancelled.</p>

<h3>Swapping the Phoenix in the Nest</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter One: Tasting Tea and Making Casual Conversation by the Night Window Listening to Rain, Plucking Branches and Spreading Fragrance in the Flower Alley of Glamorous Shadows</p>
<p>Ping Shan couldn't help but stretch his legs, raise his hands, and yawn twice. He said, "I've been saying too many of these boring things. I'm afraid I'm delaying your evening studies, so I must take my leave." Guoqi laughed, "I've already explained that you're not delaying my work here." Ping Shan said, "I won't stay any longer. Let me leave you with an appointment. If it's sunny tomorrow, let's go to Jiming Temple for a pot of tea and see the spring mountains after the rain. If it rains, I'll have the stove fire and tea leaves ready at home. After your classes, come to my house for a tea-tasting and casual chat." Guoqi said, "I'm very sorry. Originally, we could have had a tea-tasting and casual chat tonight, but my maid at home is just having a day off today. I wanted to do it myself, but I was afraid my mother wouldn't like it. She would come and do it for me. So, after you arrived, I only offered you this pot of hot tea that I had hidden in my rattan basket." As he spoke, he opened the rattan basket that was placed on the tea table in the corner of his desk and held up the handle of the teapot inside. Ping Shan shook his head and laughed, "Keep that pot of tea for yourself to enjoy. I know you won't be brewing tea tonight. With your consideration for your loving mother, I have a feeling of 'one should have a son like Sun Zhongmou'." Guoqi repeatedly cupped his hands and laughed, "You flatter me! Actually, a person's circumstances can create a certain kind of temperament. My mother raised me to adulthood in very poor circumstances. I don't need to find words about the kindness of parents in books to teach me; I have seen with my own eyes how many years of hardship my mother has suffered. Now that I can't let my mother enjoy blessings, I should at least let the old woman feel some comfort in her heart." Ping Shan had stood up to leave, but after hearing this speech, he turned slightly to the side and pondered for a moment. He laughed, "I'm going back to my previous topic. Someone like you must have a new way of thinking and be rich in old morality to be suitable to be your wife. There are too many conditions, so it's really not easy." Guoqi stepped forward, shook his hand several times, and laughed. "Why do you have to discuss it as a problem? This kind of talk is inherently close to fantasy. Is there any fantasy worth discussing?" Ping Shan and he were talking and slowly walking outwards. Guoqi held the glass-covered kerosene lamp and walked to the main room to light the way for him. Unexpectedly, a gust of strong wind, bringing a lot of rain mist, rushed straight in and extinguished the lamp. Guoqi said, "Oh dear! It's even darker now, be careful as you walk." Ping Shan said, "It's okay, it's okay, I know the way well." "Oh!" Guoqi said, "What's wrong?" Ping Shan laughed, "I stepped in the ditch and got my foot wet." Guoqi said, "Wait a moment, I'll go light the lamp again." As he spoke, he went into the room to light the lamp. But when he came out again with the lamp, Ping Shan was already far away. (18)</p>
<h3>Four Types of Temperament</h3>
<p>— Hu Chuyu</p>
<p>A person's temperament can be judged from a single tear! This is a recently discovered truth. In medical research, regardless of who it is, by carefully examining all the bodily fluids produced, such as tears, saliva, sweat, and excreted feces and urine, one can diagnose their temperament. Therefore, anything attached to the body fluids or secretions of a person, such as hats, gloves, towels, toothpicks, trousers, etc., can be used as data for judgment. Why is that? Simply put, it is the result of blood type research. According to the discovery of Landsteiner in 1901, human blood, due to the reaction of blood cell agglutination, can be divided into four types: O, A, B, and AB. In the thirty years since then, based on Landsteiner's discovery, its application in medicine for blood transfusions, grafting, skin transplants, as well as in genetics, forensic medicine, anthropology, and psychology, has been truly astonishing. From blood type, one can judge that human bodies have a common temperament, and from their bodily fluids, one can know their blood type. As for identifying blood type, only blood is taken to know the blood cell agglutination reaction. At the same time, from bodily fluids, one can judge a person's temperament, because bodily fluids are blood with everything except blood cells and have the same agglutination elements as blood. Their blood type can be understood using the same method as blood. According to the research of Takeji Furukawa, the characteristics of each blood type are as follows: O type people cannot be driven by emotion, are extremely impolite, but are very straightforward, not easily swayed by others, have a strong spirit, are decisive and not easily confused, and have a strong sense of self-confidence. A type people are gentle in nature, very attentive to things, but are easily confused by everything, are also very emotional, unwilling to argue with others about right and wrong, and are willing to suffer losses themselves. B type people are extremely carefree, calm in the face of events, like to talk about cheerful things, are extremely optimistic, are smooth in social interactions, and like to show off when taking on tasks. AB type people have contradictory temperaments, are extremely difficult to judge, have the appearance of B type but the inner nature of A type. In addition, there are varying amounts of O type mixed in A type and B type. Generally speaking, A type and AB type people have passive temperaments, while O type and B type people have active temperaments.</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>The Human-Faced Fox and the Mermaid Tail</h3>
<p>— Ai Mei</p>
<p>Speaking of it, this matter happened several days ago. At that time, I often went to the editorial office of the Central Bookstore on Wuma Road to chat with Brother Zheng Yimei. Each time, I saw a family standing in front of a lane, with several old northerners holding rattan whips, shouting, "Hey! Come and see! A fox with a human face, and a mermaid with a tail; come! Come! Eight coppers to see." On the wall in front of the door, there were also two monthly calendar-style paintings, depicting models of "the human-faced fox and the mermaid tail." I thought, "In the past, there were often exhibitions of people with three legs, people with tails, and crab-backed mermaids in amusement parks. Although I have never seen them, in fact, people are just produced by birth defects, and crabs are artificially fabricated. Now, so-called freaks and monsters are nothing more than the aforementioned two types." Therefore, I never went in to see them.</p>
<p>Later, this entertainment moved to Xinzha Road, which was very close to where I lived. Some curious friends went to visit and came back to tell me, "This doesn't look like a disguise at all. That fox really has a human face and a fox body, and that mermaid (?) really has a natural fleshy tail." Well, then these naturally belong to the category of birth defects. But I still had no interest in appreciating them.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard an old man tell a shocking story, which made me pay attention to this "human-faced fox and mermaid tail." The old man said, "Most of the wandering performers are not good people. There was once a performing bear whose bear was not only very skilled, but also able to speak human language. A veteran legal advisor saw it and became suspicious, so he reported it to the magistrate, who unexpectedly arrested the performer along with the bear. The bear actually burst into tears in court, saying: He was originally a human, but at the age of twelve, he was kidnapped by this performer, who made him perform for several years. Because he caught a bear, he would kill it and peel off its skin. Then, he would cut open the human's skin, wrap it in the bear skin, and glue the human blood and bear blood together. He would then sew it together with needles and thread, so that the human and the bear would become one. Because of the long fur, there were no traces. Based on the confession in court, the magistrate punished the performer according to the law, but the victim, pitifully, could never recover his human body. This happened during the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty. It is said that there were many similar tragedies, but most of them were given drugs so that they could not speak, so there was no way to discover them, and they could only sink to the bottom of the sea unjustly!"</p>
<p>Hearing this kind of talk made me suspicious. I thought, "Could this 'human-faced fox and mermaid tail' also be this kind of trick?" But now, when I pass by Xinzha Road, it is no longer there. Therefore, there is no way to see it in person. I wonder if it has moved to another road to be displayed, or if it has already left Shanghai?</p>
<p>I think this kind of thing is worth studying!</p>
<p>Book and Newspaper Review</p>
<h3>Reflections on Reading "Bai Men Xin Ying"</h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>A few days ago, I returned to my hometown. I estimated that the round trip would take ten hours on the boat and train. I was worried about not having anything to do, when my old friend Yi Junzuo sent me a copy of "Bai Men Xin Ying" from the Zhen Ting Qingyunmen Half-Month Society, which became my companion for understanding.</p>
<p>I first saw the inscription by Madam Tao Mo'an: "The author is willing to use 200,000 words of flourishing prose to write a biography for an extraordinary woman. If this woman really existed, she would definitely be very sympathetic and grateful to him." And Junzuo's preface: "I have a very good friend named Huaqi Jiuyou... For the great compassion of mankind, for the exploration of the light, heat, and power of the universe, he finally took a woman as his subject and generously accepted the request of the tragic beauty, using a grand style of over 200,000 words in eighteen chapters to tell the story of such a moving person." I was also deceived by this, thinking that the author of this novel was Huaqi Jiuyou. Moreover, the author also had a preface that said: "Does the world think of this book as a shadow of Mo'an? Then it is not! Does it not think of it as a shadow of Mo'an? It is also not! Right and wrong cannot be determined." But after reading a few chapters, I knew that those words were all the cunning of a literary man, and it was clear that he was using Madam Tao Mo'an as the heroine of this book; Qiao Jingxuan was her alias.</p>
<p>Madam Tao is the niece of Duanwuqiao, a famous female opera singer in Beiping. Her experiences were very tragic. Although I did not shed tears after reading it, I was also moved by it. In the era of transition from old to new, there were many weak women in families full of feudal atmosphere who tried to seek liberation but could not. Therefore, this book can be said to be a simplified modern Dream of the Red Chamber.</p>
<p>This book was previously published in the Nanjing National Salvation Daily. It is said that it was accidentally interrupted for a month at the time, and the number of letters from readers inquiring about it was like snowflakes. It can be seen that its attractiveness was so great! From my point of view, the characteristic of this book is that it can eliminate all the bad aspects of old-fashioned chapters novels and use a new and not overly exaggerated style to describe delicate feelings. Therefore, many philosophical arguments in the middle are dissolved in the author's expression. And the character Liu Bai in the book is able to avoid the malpractice of excessive literary elements that lead to distortion. This is the power that makes readers feel light and crisp and reluctant to let go.</p>
<p>The social reflections of the Xinhai Revolution have been written a lot in past novels. However, the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, such a political turning point, still lacks a work that uses small brushstrokes to write about the big picture, so that later generations can know some of the dynamics of the people at that time. Then "Bai Men Xin Ying" is the book that bears the responsibility. From this, we can know that the author writes so easily and effortlessly, and indeed his talent is not small!</p>
<p>When Mr. Liu Yazi went to the capital last month, he hit it off with Junzuo at first sight, and he also wrote twenty-eight characters on this book: "Three buckets of tears, thousands of threads, writing the most beautiful posture in the world. If a madman is allowed to keep one side, fortunately, the distant mountains and eyebrows are at the same time." It can well express the author's painstaking efforts. Because Yazi also has long heard of Madam Mo'an's life story, and wanted to see her in person, so he said this. But he also said it vaguely, and did not say whether she existed or not. Poets are, after all, accustomed to being cunning.</p>
<p>I have revealed the author's secret, or perhaps the author will not allow it. However, I have one thing that may make the author feel a little relieved, that is, I am negotiating with a certain film company to adapt this book into a film script, so that the author's hard work can gain more great sympathizers through the projection of the silver screen.</p>

<h3>Finance: The Instability of the French Franc; Local Foreign Exchange Market Tight for Sterling, Loose for U.S. Dollars</h3>
<p>Half-Day Transactions Entirely Between Banks for Spot Deals; Gold Market Closed Due to Revolutionary Government Commemoration Holiday</p>
<p>Due to the unstable trend of the French franc and the rise in exchange rates, the foreign exchange market yesterday showed a pattern of sterling flat and U.S. dollars down. Later, HSBC posted prices that were bullish for both sterling and U.S. dollars. Banks engaged in frequent transactions, and the half-day process was relatively flat. Early in the morning, overseas telegrams reported that London's big deals were up 1.25 for both near and far terms. It was said that the market would post prices after closing, with a small number of Indian trades and sellers. New York's silver market was quiet. Forward silver prices in Monterrey rose by 3.3% and 3.1%, respectively. London spot gold plummeted by 6 pence. Sterling rose 2 points against the U.S. dollar, and 28 points against the French franc. The U.S. dollar rose 1.8125 points against sterling, and was flat against the French franc. This was because the left wing won the French elections, and the future of the gold standard was uncertain, causing a selling trend for the French franc. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with recent selling prices of sterling at one shilling, two pence, four three seven five and half a penny on offer, and U.S. dollars at twenty-nine yuan eight seven five, which was half a penny tighter for sterling and 0.125 looser for U.S. dollars compared to the previous close. After opening, banks frequently traded spot sterling and spot U.S. dollars, and the situation was relatively flat. After HSBC announced its posted prices, both sterling and U.S. dollars were flat. After this, banks continued to trade. Later, Dalian dealers slightly bought Eastern exchange, and Japanese banks blocked it, but bought sterling, which made the process slightly tight. The market situation was still dominated by interbank transactions and lacked special changes. Extending to the midday close, recent selling prices were sterling at one shilling, two pence, four three seven five strong, and U.S. dollars at thirty-nine yuan eight one two five, which was slightly tighter for sterling and 0.0625 looser for U.S. dollars compared to the previous close. The same was true for forward terms, due to the rise in exchange rates. Chinese merchants were not heard to be active. The half-day transaction prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Securities: Bulls Stop Pushing Up, Government Bonds Show Slight Weakness</h3>
<p>Transactions Extremely Scattered</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend at the Chinese Securities Exchange was flat and weak due to the stalemate between bulls and bears. Although large investors relaxed their pushing up, sellers were cautious and did not sell off as much as possible, but the buying momentum has weakened. However, it is difficult to predict whether they will abandon pushing up altogether. Although the situation looks weak, a sharp decline is not necessarily imminent. If trading decreases, the market will turn to consolidation. Yesterday's market was very mediocre, and trading has already decreased. Although Nos. 4 and 11 still saw buying, the amount was limited. Although the listed prices were still lively, due to the stalemate, very few transactions took place, only some sporadic trading. The morning session was firm, but uneven. The second session weakened, falling slightly by 5 fen to 1 jiao or 1 jiao and a half all the way. In the afternoon, due to some selling of No. 11, the decline continued, slightly smaller by 5 fen to 1 jiao or 2 jiao and a half. The closing session returned to a chaotic and uncertain appearance. Only this month's small triangles were the most active, due to some hedging relationships, so their forward prices were still 5 fen higher. As a result, market prices fell back by 5 fen to 1 jiao, up to 4 jiao and a half. The total transaction volume was 3,285,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed in the table on the left.</p>
<p>(Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<h3>New York General Motors Shares Lead Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 4th), the New York stock market initially fell due to the French elections, then slowly rebounded. The results were mixed, slightly higher. General Motors led the advance of auto stocks. The company announced a dividend after the close. Rubber stocks also rose due to a 5.5 to 13 percent increase in tire prices. Other stocks such as railroads, oil, farm equipment, and steel all rose. Small exchange stocks were mixed and weak, with very sluggish trading. The market was quiet and mixed. The total daily volume was 1,070,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>It is Difficult to Expect the Market to Rise in the Short Term</p>
<p>The yarn market is quiet and the situation is weak. The reason is that yarn sales have not developed significantly, and the cotton market is sluggish, so most people are leaning towards the bearish side. Therefore, it is not easy for the market to rise in the short term. However, some people's intentions are gradually shifting from bearish to bullish, and the volume is said to be quite large.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Rises in Near Months, Falls in Far Months</p>
<p>The opening of the standard yarn market in the previous session saw declines in all months. Due to the weak overseas yarn and cotton market, sellers were active, and market prices were normal. But after the first session, Hexing continued to buy, and the listed prices were maintained, and the momentum turned firm. As a result, the near months rose by 3 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price, while the far months remained unchanged. The market was said to be tight. The prices of all months rose by 2 and 3 jiao. By the third closing session, Hexing sold off, and Osaka Sampin Yarn telegraphed a drop of 2 yuan, 3 and 4 jiao. The market atmosphere suddenly loosened, and market prices fell. As a result, all months fell by 1, 2, and 4 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Da Feng sold 1,050 bales, Mingde 700 bales, Sai Feng 1,050 bales, Shenji 1,250 bales, Ren Feng 700 bales, Yuan Yi 550 bales, Xincheng 500 bales, Changhe 550 bales, and Taichang 550 bales. Juxing bought 1,350 bales, Hexing 1,250 bales, Changyu 500 bales, Yongchang 550 bales, Chengji 500 bales, Hengyi 500 bales, Taixing 900 bales, and Changfeng 800 bales, Tonghe 650 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>1,600 Bales of Yarn Sold</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. It was found that all gangs bought a total of 1,600 bales throughout the day, and the selling price rose by 5 jiao. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below.</p>
<h3>Near-Term Cotton Bulls Maintain</h3>
<p>The cotton market was firm in the morning and weak in the afternoon. The market situation is still mediocre. Because there is a lack of demand for large quantities of coarse cotton, the industry's thinking is still bearish. At the same time, spot cotton mills' demand is not smooth, and the overseas Indian and American cotton markets have fallen. However, Hexing is working hard to purchase.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton, Deda and Hefeng Drag In</p>
<p>In the previous session of the standard cotton market, the opening price fell by 3 to 8 pounds due to the selling of American cotton futures in the South. The decline in Indian cotton was also fierce, falling by 0.5 to 2 rupees, 25. Osaka Sampin cotton fell by 3, 4 and 5 jiao. The market was depressed, but bulls in the near months continued to increase their positions, and the market was slightly tighter, while the far months were slightly looser. After the second session, Hexing, Renfeng, and Changfeng continued to absorb, and the buying momentum was fierce. However, Gengfeng, Run Kang, and Xincheng continued to increase their short positions step by step. As a result, the prices of all months rose by 1 jiao and a half to 2 jiao and 3 jiao compared to the previous day's closing prices. After the afternoon opening, the market situation was still tight, and Deda bought vigorously. But after entering, some bulls sold out, and the yarn market was weak. By the time of closing, the market became tired again. As a result, the prices of all months fell by 5 fen to 1 jiao compared to the morning closing prices. It was found that Yuanda sold 1,900 dan, Juxing 3,100 dan, Yuda 3,100 dan, Gengfeng 9,600 dan, Shenchang 2,500 dan, Yuan 3,800 dan, Run Kang 5,700 dan, Xincheng 3,700 dan, Yuanyu Chang 6,100 dan, Dachang 1,900 dan, and Changyu 1,700 dan. Deda bought 9,700 dan, Jifeng 3,300 dan, Hexing 7,200 dan, Renfeng 3,500 dan, Changfeng 8,700 dan, Yitang 4,300 dan, and Xingchang 1,100 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Manufacturers Wait and See</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is extremely quiet, and manufacturers are all taking a wait-and-see attitude. 280 bales of Jiayuan Yaohua and 80 bales of Tonghua.</p>
<h3>Overseas Cotton Falls More Than Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, and the market was extremely sluggish. The near months rose by 4 pounds due to industry buying, while the far months fell by 6 pounds due to rainfall in the southwestern cotton area over the weekend, foreign merchants selling, and cotton farmers hedging. Buyers were cautious, and the international political situation was extremely unstable. Later, Chen cotton saw a small recovery because the cotton hoarders sold the May contract when the price was at 1 jiao, 1 fen, 5 li, 2 hao. There were not many sellers, and the trend was still stable. It is estimated that spot prices rose by 1 pound and futures prices rose by 1 pound to fall by 8 pounds. British spot cotton fell by 6 points and futures fell by 7 and 8 points. Indian cotton initially saw a small number of speculators buying, but then weakened due to the fall in silver dollars. Speculators sold off. Japanese merchants had both buying and selling. It is estimated that Pingguoer fell by 0.5 to 0.75 rupees, Aomula fell by 1 to 1.25 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 2 to 2.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (4th telegram).</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for the July-August Bai Luoxi cotton contract on the 5th was 198 rupees, down by half a rupee from the previous day.</p>
<p>Sampin Yarn and Cotton Falling Sharply</p>
<p>Osaka telegram on the 5th: Sampin futures yarn fell by 1 yuan, 2 jiao to 2 yuan, 1 jiao, with the near month at 196 yuan and the far month at 194 yuan, 2 jiao. Cotton futures fell by 5 jiao, 5 fen to 6 jiao, 5 fen, with the near month at 64 yuan, 1 jiao and the far month at 58 yuan, 8 jiao.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods and Cotton Cloth, Southern Merchants Begin Buying</h3>
<p>Goods Prices Rely on It to Stabilize</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth piece goods, after falling for many days, the price of goods gradually stabilized with the standard yarn and cotton. Various merchant gangs, after being extremely quiet, began to move. Except for the northern Qingjin and other ports, which remained sluggish, other places, such as Zhejiang, Anhui, Sichuan, and Guangdong, began to purchase. Fujian also saw slight sales. The Sichuan gang was better, continuing to purchase Guanghua Factory's Xiaogan brand, Yifeng Factory's Zuanfeng brand, Yuyuanheng Factory's Wudie brand, and blue cloth, yuan gray fine material grain from Dagong Ren and other factories, for a total of more than 400 pieces. The Guangdong gang continued to purchase fine twill such as Jiaguan, Paogou, and Yunding brands, fine cloth such as Renyu, Yunshi, and Yuanshi brands, Shuangfeng Xin Tiao fanchou and other goods, for more than 300 pieces. Zhulu Wintai and other ports also added 70 or 80 pieces of the factory's fine cloth, coarse cloth, and fancy goods. Yongbang entered Western goods, Huajia plain fanchou, the factory's Lixin Huayang medium-grade so fanchou, and more than 20 boxes of Xiayang yarn.</p>
<h3>White Serge, Although Rising, Still Has Little Stock</h3>
<p>The wool goods and wool fabrics that are needed for summer sales are currently selling well. White plain serge is very tight in Shanghai, and the market atmosphere is very firm. The selling price is higher than other wool fabrics. The reason is that the domestic products are rough, and the imported products are in short supply. Those that arrive cost more than last year. For example, Fengyu white serge was only 4 yuan and 5 jiao per yard last year, but this summer it must be 5 yuan, 4 and 5 jiao per yard, which caused the opening price to rise sharply. The Japanese white serge that was sold for 2 yuan and 7 or 8 jiao before is now uniformly sold for 3 yuan and 5 or 6 jiao. There are not many people holding physical goods.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Export Silk Sales Turning Around, White Filature Rises Another 15 Yuan</h3>
<p>Cannot Be Optimistic About the Cold Silkworm Season</p>
<p>Recently, the local silk market has become increasingly prosperous and feels prosperous. All export companies have considerable appetites. White filature 20-22 denier has risen by about 15 yuan. Yesterday, the French exchange rate rose, European sales were slightly sluggish, and local manufacturers, in view of the cold weather and continuous spring rain, which is detrimental to the development of young silkworms, are not completely optimistic about this spring's silkworm harvest. Therefore, silkworm farmers are all looking at high prices, and current silk merchants are also reluctant to sell easily. Therefore, yesterday's local market atmosphere presented a clear and firm situation. Only Dachang and Xinfu had 20 or 30 bales of transactions each.</p>
<h3>Abundant Production of Tunxi New Tea</h3>
<p>Recently, 5,000 to 6,000 dan of Tunxi new tea from various sources have been concentrated. It is said that the weather is still good, and production is quite strong. Most wealthy companies have already started to search for purchases and rush production. However, most tea houses are eagerly awaiting the opening of Shanghai warehouses as soon as possible. At present, when competitive purchases have not yet become widespread, the selling price of raw tea is only 57 or 8 yuan per dan. After the opening, the market price will definitely rise sharply.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou New Tea to Be Launched Today</h3>
<p>Maocha from Various Provinces in Zhejiang Reported to Be Rising</p>
<p>The Wenzhou new tea from Lailuzhuang, the Hongchajiao and Yongchazhan in this city, has already transported more than a dozen boxes of black tea, and 20 boxes of Zhenmei green tea. Because the association decided to open the market today, it is allowed to display samples as usual to meet the needs of foreign firms. According to news from various sources yesterday, Maocha from Xiaoshan, Zhuji, Tianyun, Suian, Shangyu, Yuyao and other provinces in Zhejiang have all reported price increases. The reason is that the demand from Shanghai Zhuanghao has greatly increased. Tea from Zhuji and Xiaoshan has risen from 57 or 8 yuan to 63 or 4 yuan. Goods from Suian Gaozhuang have already increased to 80 yuan, and the rest have also risen by 1 or 2 yuan to 3 or 4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains: Manufacturers Sell Off, Flour Prices Fall Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the prices of each month showed a trend of first stabilizing and then rising, followed by a tired decline. The quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago was good for 1, 2 or 3 jiao, Canada was small for 4 fen. When the price was opened, the market had fallen for several days in a row, and some floating shorts inevitably thought of covering their positions. In addition, the factories were watching and did not hear of continued selling, so on one side, outsiders bought in, and on the other side, the shorts smoothly covered their positions. As a result, the prices of each month gradually rose by 3 fen. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the situation suddenly changed drastically. Because the weather was quite good, factories in this city and other places unanimously sold off, so the price decline resumed, and trading was very active. It is estimated that more than 400,000 bags were transacted in the morning, and more than 700,000 bags in the afternoon, with prices falling back by 2, 3 and 4 fen compared to the morning closing price, and falling by 1 and 2 fen compared to the previous day. According to the current situation, the factories have begun to sell off. If the weather is smooth and a good wheat harvest is expected, it will be difficult for the market to stabilize.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Fall Back in the Afternoon Following the Flour Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market saw a rebound in the morning and then fell back in the afternoon. Because the market sentiment is that big declines are followed by small rebounds, which is the dynamic that a speculative market should have, the opening prices of each month were 2 and 3 fen higher than the previous day, and trading suddenly became active due to the expansion of the筹码 (筹码: trading chips). By the time the market opened in the afternoon, because the flour market had already fallen back, most of the brokers and bulls sold off smoothly, and the market turned sharply downwards. The opening price fell by 3 or 4 fen, and then fell by 2 or 3 fen. The future situation will depend on the wheat harvest, and also on the flour market. The current spot wheat market, although the inventory is exhausted, the price has also loosened due to the sharp decline in the standard price. It is said that the price reduction has dropped to 5 yuan, 1 jiao and a half, and there is not much trading.</p>
<p>The US wheat market situation: the southwest celebrated the arrival of timely rain. The buying before the close was said to be in anticipation of the estimates to be released tomorrow that would benefit the bulls, and because the visible supply decreased by 1,598,000 bushels. However, given the good condition of the current crops, prices may not rise significantly. Canadian wheat is estimated to decrease by 153,000 bushels.</p>
<h3>Hesha Rice Sells Slowly, Market Conditions Are Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various gangs were still only about 20 (goods totaled more than 4,000 shi). The sales in this street moved but were not smooth. Baozhou was still only 100 or so packages handled by Tianjin. Therefore, the market conditions did not turn around even though arrivals had been scarce for several days, only seeing flatness. The prices of early japonica and thin indica rice were not glorious or disgraced. Du Yangjian and Yinbian Yuan were also similar.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 24 or 25 boats arrived from Hesha from various gangs. In the morning, the sky was cloudy, and the sales of white japonica rice continued to decline, and the price was shouted tight by several fen. In the afternoon, the sky cleared, and the zero stomach (胃口: appetite) turned tired. As a result, the market price was still fixed. The arrival of thin indica rice was not strong, and the stomach moved slightly, and the price was tightly tied. Yin Yuan also saw a tight trend. The prices of other goods did not rise or fall.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian's Price Decline Has Stopped, Foreign Rice Has Arrived</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of Ke Xian continued from Changjiang, Wenzhou and Taiwan and other gangs. However, the actual sales in this street continued to be strong, and there were also warehouse and military needs. The air of continuous sluggishness and dispiritedness has been completely eliminated. The selling of goods in the market is not as weak as before. Therefore, the price decline has stopped, and the market has turned to a stable situation. More than 9,000 packages of Jiangxi rice, 400 packages of Xiang rice, 350 packages of Taiwan and Wenzhou rice, and 500 packages of Jiangxi rice were opened throughout the day. A total of more than 10,000 packages were opened. If digestion does not decline in the future, the market price may turn for the better, otherwise it will only hover.</p>
<p>More than 6,000 packages of Saigon rice were shipped by the French company Zhen Nusha this morning and unloaded at the Zhaoshangju North Wharf. It is said that the foreign rice will also be transferred to the Yangtze River.</p>

<h3>North-South Goods: Abundant Production of Haikou Lychee Seedlings</h3>
<p>A Bumper Harvest Can Be Expected This Year</p>
<p>Due to the poor harvest of Haikou lychees last year, the stock was sold out early. According to reliable information from the production area, this year's new seedlings are quite good, and the flower buds are luxuriant. If there are no typhoons or other disasters, the new goods will have a full harvest when they debut in the future.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Road Bitter Almonds Fall Two Yuan</h3>
<p>The arrival of miscellaneous road bitter almonds has seen an increase recently, but the demand has become dull. Therefore, the market price has turned down. Yesterday, miscellaneous road goods were sold for 27 yuan, a decrease of 2 yuan before and after. However, it is said that the quality of sealed goods is higher, and the stock is also small, and the market is still stable. Opened 18 yuan, it is said that the price has recently stabilized, and the market is expected to have no further rise for the time being.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Smoke Skin Iron Factories' Sales are Progressing Rapidly</h3>
<p>Since the enamel factory stopped running, the market for smoke skin iron has been depressed for a long time. Since the recent past, the sales of thermos factories, ordnance factories, and small machine factories have progressed rapidly, with transactions reaching as many as 4,000 to 5,000 dans. The 18-sheet, 13-sheet, 9-sheet, 10-sheet, and 4-sheet and 5-sheet patterns in the market are selling briskly. Because there is a shortage, prices are rising steadily. 18-sheet sells for 9 yuan and 2 and a half jiao per dan, 13-sheet sells for 10 yuan, 9-sheet and 10-sheet both open at 9 yuan and 7 and a half jiao, and 4-sheet and 5-sheet then open at 9 yuan and 2 and a half jiao. It is found that the stock in the market is thin and the arrival of goods is not sustained. It is hoped that the market will continue to be good in the future.</p>

<h3>Restoring Youth from Premature Aging</h3>
<p>— Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Life goes from childhood to youth, from youth to adulthood, from adulthood to old age, and from old age to decline. This is physiological aging. If endowment is insufficient or the body is weak, then even in youth, one already exhibits old age. This is pathological premature aging.</p>
<p>The source of premature aging lies in the lack of secretion in the gonads, which leads to loss of spirit, qi, and blood. The most effective medicine for the symptoms is "Germinal Essence". After taking it, the body becomes strong and healthy, and youth can be expected.</p>
<p>For example, last winter, a patient named Fang Zixing, not yet forty years old, was already like someone past fifty. He repeatedly took tonics but could not be cured. I instructed him to purchase "Germinal Essence" from Wuzhou Pharmacy. After taking it for about a month, his qi and blood immediately became vigorous, and his spirit was rejuvenated. He returned to the youthful state of adulthood.</p>
<h3>Leukorrhea - Infertility</h3>
<p>— Yu Bofu</p>
<p>Leukorrhea is a type of purulent secretion caused by uterine inflammation. Nineteen out of ten women suffer from it. If it is not treated early, the body will become weak and there will be no way to conceive and give birth. This is why one remains infertile after a long marriage.</p>
<p>Last fall, a patient named Mrs. Shi Wenrong came to complain of the above symptoms. I instructed her to purchase "Female Germinal Essence" for internal use and "Leukorrhea Cure" for external use from Taihe Pharmacy. Following the treatment, within a month, the inflammation was gone, the uterus was healthy, the discharge was clear, the menstruation was regulated, and the breasts developed, regaining their beauty. This spring, Mr. Shi introduced his close friend to treat his stomach pain. During the conversation, he learned that his wife had been married for many years and was now pregnant.</p>
<h3>Seminal Emission, Bone Pain, Safe Smoking Cessation</h3>
<p>— Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>During the smoking cessation period, one should first treat old and long-standing ailments. Otherwise, ailments will occur repeatedly, and the pain of smoking cessation will make it difficult to complete the task.</p>
<p>Recently, I simultaneously helped Zhen Xiaoting and Zhao Binjun and others to quit their smoking habits. Mr. Zhen complained of stomach pain. I prescribed "Stomach Pain Cure" to treat it. Mr. Zhao complained of seminal emission. I prescribed "Hemet's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" to treat it. Furthermore, I used "Germinal Essence" to remove their nicotine addiction and break their smoking habits. The time was about four weeks, and I was able to complete the task of safe smoking cessation.</p>
<h3>Joint Pain, Numbness in the Limbs</h3>
<p>— Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>There are three roots to joint pain. It may be due to the internal accumulation of rheumatism, or due to residual toxins not being cleansed, or due to excessive uric acid, resulting in unclean blood. Entering the bones causes bone pain, entering the tendons causes tendon pain. If it is not treated for a long time, the limbs will become numb and insensitive, losing flexibility. In severe cases, hemiplegia and paralysis of the whole body will occur.</p>
<p>In early spring, a patient with bone pain, Mr. Wang Ciguang, came to complain of numbness in his limbs and bone pain. I instructed him to purchase the famous medicine "Johnston's Bone Pain Tablets" from Zhongfa Pharmacy. After taking four and a half boxes in a row, he was completely cured. His body was light and healthy, and he thanked me happily.</p>
<h3>(174) Medicine for Intellectual and Physical Insanity</h3>

<h3>Dizziness - Brain Weakness</h3>
<p>— Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>The brain is the spiritual palace of the human body, relying entirely on the nourishment of the secretion of the gonads. If you suffer from nocturnal emission or weakness, etc., then the gonads will decline, and the brain will not be able to get its nourishment, forming dizziness, insomnia, forgetfulness, etc. The best treatment is to take gonadal preparations.</p>
<p>For example, recently, Mr. He Wenhua complained of nocturnal emission, insomnia, brain weakness, dizziness, etc. I instructed him to purchase "Hemet's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" from Huamei Pharmacy to treat his nocturnal emission, and to use "Germinal Essence" to nourish the brain and replenish essence. After taking it for more than two weeks, he was cured and regained a healthiness he had never had before.</p>
<h3>A Collection of Thank-You Letters</h3>
<p>Underdevelopment</p>
<p>Mr. You Chongxin from Xuzhou wrote: I was born with insufficient endowment, resulting in poor development. My body is thin and weak, and I have many diseases. I was introduced to take "Germinal Essence" and should purchase it from Zhongxi Pharmacy. After taking it, my muscles became strong and my weight increased. I regained development. It's like two different people before and after.</p>
<p>First Pregnancy After Long Marriage</p>
<p>Mr. Cao Junren from Zhenjiang wrote: My wife suffers from menstrual irregularities and leukorrhea. She has been married for seven years, but has never conceived. I sent a letter to this publication. I was instructed to take "Female Germinal Essence" internally and "Leukorrhea Cure" externally. I regulated menstruation and treated leukorrhea. After taking half a dozen doses and using three boxes externally, I was cured. The next month I was pregnant. Now I am three months pregnant. Remembering your efforts, I am writing this letter of thanks.</p>
<p>Loss of Appetite</p>
<p>Mr. Zhuang Guoliang wrote: I suffer from loss of appetite and stomach weakness, poor digestion, and lack of appetite. I saw in this publication that "Stomach Invigorating Essence" can treat this disease, invigorate the stomach, stimulate appetite, and increase appetite. After taking four boxes in a row, my digestion became strong and my appetite increased dramatically. Now my stomach is strong and my body is strong. Only a famous medicine can achieve this.</p>
<p>Complete Cure of Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Yinxuan wrote: Five years ago, I accidentally got involved with a prostitute after drinking, resulting in gonorrhea. My urethra was stinging and I urinated frequently. I took certain medicines repeatedly, but to no avail. Later, I was introduced by Dr. Zhou Xiaohan to Dr. Zhan Nianzeng for electric medicine and progress. Before a month had passed, I was completely cured. Dr. Zhan is indeed a merciful raft in the turbid sea and a bright light in the bitter sea.</p>
<p>Circumcision</p>
<p>Mr. Cao from Xiamen Road in this city wrote: I committed masturbation when I was young, resulting in a malformation. And my foreskin was also too long. I thought about having it cut off many times, but I was afraid of the pain, so I didn't dare to try it. Later, I saw that my fellow villager Mr. Shen had phimosis and had it cut off at Dr. Zhan Nianzeng's place. According to him, there was no pain at all. I immediately asked him to introduce me to Dr. Zhan for circumcision. Sure enough, there was no pain at all.</p>
<p>Rheumatic Bone Pain</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Shixi from Junyi Lane, Jielu, wrote: My mother has had chronic rheumatism for many years, and has been treated repeatedly without success. Her bones hurt, her tendons contracted, her limbs were numb, and her body trembled. She suffered unspeakable pain. Later, she sent a letter to this publication. She was instructed to take "Female Germinal Essence" and "Johnston's Bone Pain Tablets" to treat her condition. She immediately purchased them from Zhongxi Pharmacy and followed the instructions. She was cured within a month. Now her body is healthy and her bones are comfortable. She is sending this letter of thanks.</p>

(Treatment) -- I instructed him to purchase and take "Heemitot's Sperm Consolidating Tablets" from a Chinese and Western pharmacy to treat nocturnal emission. He took "Johnston's Bone Pain Tablets" to treat bone pain. He took "Reproductive Essence" to treat lower back pain, insomnia, weakness, and other symptoms.

<h3>Selection of Internal Medications for Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Zhiming</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is a difficult disease to treat, and there are many treatment methods. In the past, only local washing was used, which was sometimes effective, but very painful. Nowadays, it is only considered one of the treatment methods and is no longer relied upon exclusively. Modern gonorrhea treatment methods can be said to be the best possible. (1) Electrical therapy: Gonorrhea is divided into acute and chronic, and electrical equipment includes the latest turbid liquid treatment machines and shortwave diathermy machines. (2) Injection: Such as pigment preparations and mixed gonococcal vaccines, etc., can penetrate the membrane to kill bacteria or provide self-immunity and achieve great results. (3) Washing: Today, there is also the invention of gonococcal blood serum ointment for urethral injection. It is convenient to use and effective. Among such preparations, the "Gono-gerol" produced by the German Mann and Schrotter Pharmaceutical Factory is the best. (4) Internal medicines: This type of preparation is the most common on the market. However, their effectiveness is often inaccurate. It is difficult to choose accurately. In my clinical practice, I prefer "Mesalin" because this medicine not only has a strong antibacterial effect but also has anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antiseptic, and diuretic effects. It has been repeatedly used and is always effective. It is truly a formidable enemy of gonorrhea.</p>
<h3>Neurasthenia and Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— Ren Zhi</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission, as a symptom, can be physiological, and should not be viewed as pathological in all cases. However, in clinical practice, it is mostly a pathological phenomenon. The occurrence of such symptoms is mostly caused by bad habits or excessive sexual activity. In the beginning, it may only be nocturnal emission during sleep. Later, sexual function may completely decline, such as premature ejaculation, impotence, and other phenomena. At this point, it has reached the stage of sexual neurasthenia. Not only is there no hope of having children, but chronic diseases are also worrying. If treatment is not given at this time, and it is ignored, the disease will worsen and can lead to cerebral neurasthenia, or even generalized neurasthenia. The common symptoms found at this time, such as insomnia, poor memory, mental fatigue, headache, and dizziness, etc. The treatment of these symptoms is nothing more than nourishing the nervous system. The most important medicines for nourishing nerves are organic phosphorus, extracted from the stems and roots of plants, and endocrine preparations, extracted from the endocrine glands of animals. Both of these are good medicines for restoring weakened nerves to health. Nowadays, there are specialized preparations for these types of drugs. "Arolis," sold by the Renshou Western Pharmacy in this city, is a mixed product of organic phosphorus and endocrine preparations. It is effective for sexual neurasthenia such as nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation, and it is also effective for cerebral neurasthenia such as dizziness and insomnia. Therefore, it can be praised as the holy medicine for neurasthenia, surpassing all ordinary products.</p>
<h3>Gonococcal Arthritis</h3>
<p>— Chengde</p>
<p>Gonococcal arthritis is a type of gonococcal disease. Its cause is due to gonorrhea. Therefore, the initial onset of gonorrhea should be eradicated completely, otherwise, it will leave future troubles. The initial infection of gonorrhea has mild symptoms and is often acute anterior urethritis. At this time, if you immediately take "Mesalin" internally and use "Gon-Seroil" externally, the gonococcus can be eliminated, and gonorrhea can be cured. If it is delayed without treatment, or the treatment is not very legal, and the gonococcus cannot be killed, then the gonococcus will gradually invade the posterior urethra, progressing from acute to subacute, and then to chronic. Following this, it invades the bladder, resulting in cystitis. It invades the prostate, resulting in prostatitis. It invades the testicles, resulting in orchitis. It invades a joint, resulting in arthritis. When gonococcal arthritis occurs, the affected area is mostly swollen and painful, which is easily misdiagnosed as acute rheumatism. This is something to pay attention to. When treating this disease, in addition to tracing the cause and giving injections of gonococcal antitoxin, such as Gonagin and Arthigon, etc., shortwave diathermy in electrical therapy is also quite effective for local application. The use of such things as · agents and all anti-inflammatory pain relievers can be used according to the situation. Accurate treatment of this disease will undoubtedly lead to a cure, but if the treatment period is missed, or if it is delayed, after recovery, it may be difficult to restore the original perfect state. It is common to see that the affected limb is slightly shorter or that the development is not very complete, all of which are due to this disease.</p>
<h3>Treatment of Ringworm</h3>
<p>— Jingzhi</p>
<p>There are many types of ringworm, but they are all skin diseases. Except for so-called ichthyosis, which is difficult to cure completely, most can be cured completely. The reason why it is delayed without healing is mostly due to erroneous treatment or incomplete treatment. This disease is extremely easy to transmit. Direct contact with the skin or material media can transmit it. It occurs and heals from time to time, depending on the underlying conditions. However, this healing is latent and not a true cure. Generally, autumn and winter are the latent periods, and spring and summer are the onset periods. There are also occasional differences due to physical conditions and geographical relationships. If this pain is not treated carefully, a radical cure is difficult to achieve. The origin of ringworm is transmission, and it is easier for those with weak skin resistance. Usually, doctors and patients consider it a trivial disease and rarely pay attention to treatment. Little do they know that complete cure is not easy, such as ichthyosis. In terms of ringworm treatment, there have been specialized preparations in recent years. The German medicine "Misluzine" is a good medicine for treating ringworm. This medicine has the function of deeply penetrating the skin and does not harm internal organs. It can kill all latent ringworm fungi. Moreover, its aroma is fragrant and does not stain clothes, which is especially popular with patients. Calling it a sacred medicine for skin diseases is certainly no exaggeration. In terms of electrical equipment, high-mountain artificial sun lamps and Cromeyer lamps are both extremely effective aids.</p>
<h3>Treatment of Stomach Pain</h3>
<p>— Shantain</p>
<p>Stomach pain is a common symptom. Because it is not very serious, patients often do not seek medical treatment completely, which increases the chance of recurrence. Some suffer for a lifetime, which is truly pitiful. The causes of stomach pain are nothing more than symptoms caused by acute gastritis, chronic gastritis, hyperacidity, and gastric leakage. The treatment of these diseases, in terms of medication, is the most effective outside of agents containing alkali. However, there are countless such preparations sold on the market. Some have narcotic ingredients mixed in. Although they provide immediate relief after taking them, the cause of the disease cannot be completely cured, but rather prolonged. Therefore, although diagnosis is the first priority in treating disease, drug selection must be cautious. As for this type of stomach pain remedy containing alkali agents, as far as I know, "Wei Bao" is the only one that does not contain narcotic drugs and can relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and regulate the physiological movement function of the stomach. This medicine is not only effective for stomach pain, but also has a rapid healing effect on acute and chronic gastritis, hyperacidity, and gastric leakage. For indigestion, taking it can also restore the stomach's movement. It is truly a good medicine. In addition, during the treatment period and after recovery from stomach pain, on the one hand, it is necessary to continue taking "Wei Bao" for a complete cure, and on the other hand, it is necessary to avoid spicy, hard, and stimulating and difficult-to-digest foods!</p>
<h3>Disease Question and Answer</h3>
<p>Readers, if you have any questions about diseases, you can send a letter to inquire. The letter must be written clearly. If there are many questions, they can be listed in 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. The condition and process must be explained in detail and concisely. Those who need a written reply, please attach a return postage stamp of 2 cents for local addresses. Please attach a postage stamp of 5 cents for out-of-town addresses. Send to Shanghai Post Office Box 1668. We will reply with a special letter.</p>
<p>Suffering from Chancre</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. He Jingqiu) A friend of mine accidentally entered a brothel, resulting in two small pustules appearing on the edge of the glans of his genitals, causing extreme pain. He also has fever and chills, and there seems to be a tendency for hard nodules in the groin. May I ask what disease this is, (1) How should it be treated, (2) Which doctor specializes in this type of disease, (3) What are the consequences of not treating it?</p>
<p>(Answer) This is chancre, with the risk of concurrent buboes. Chancre can be soft or hard, or even a mixture of both. If it is indeed a combination of soft and hard chancre, then syphilis treatment is required, such as injections of 606, 914, Arsentilla, etc. It is also necessary to perform concurrent injections of chancre vaccine, Demergos. Local disinfection and antisepsis are also important. The Chunzai Hospital at 66 Ningbo Road in the French Concession of this city specializes in treating venereal diseases and is equipped with various electrical machines. You can go for diagnosis and treatment. Chancre is the initial stage of syphilis. If it is not cured, it can progress to the second stage. If soft chancre is not treated immediately, it can continue to enlarge, and even after it heals, it will be difficult to restore its original state.</p>
<p>Suffering from Stomach Disease</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Wang Shizeng) My relative has been suffering from the disease, and the stomach pain is unbearable when it occurs. It has become more severe recently, causing him to toss and turn in bed. No medicine is effective, but only opium can temporarily relieve the pain. Please tell me (1) what disease this is, (2) what good medicine is available, (3) where is it sold, and what is the price?</p>
<p>(Answer) (1) It is likely chronic gastritis, (2) "Wei Bao" is a good medicine for stomach disease and is even more effective for stomach pain. You can try taking it, (3) This medicine is sold by Renshou Western Pharmacy at No. 1 Laodexing Lane, Mintini Yin Road, Baxianqiao, French Concession of this city. Major pharmacies and major companies such as Sincere, Wing On, Nanyang, Wuzhou, Chinese and Western, and Sino-French also sell it.</p>
<p>Headache and Dizziness</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Zhiying) I have a few questions to ask, and I hope you can give me accurate instructions. I am 36 years old this year, but my physical strength has always been poor, far inferior to ordinary people. I have also had no children after marriage. In recent years, I have become extremely tired of work, and I cannot endure even a moment of mental labor. My memory is poor, and I have headaches and dizziness. I previously went to Chunzai Hospital at 66 Ningbo Road in the French Concession of this city for diagnosis and treatment. According to the doctor at the hospital, this is a symptom of neurasthenia. After only ten days of treatment, it suddenly improved by more than half. Later, I left Shanghai for other places, so I was unable to continue the treatment, and the symptoms remain the same. Please tell me (1) what self-treatment internal medicine is available for this disease, (2) how should I maintain my health? I would be grateful if you could publish this in your journal.</p>
<p>(Answer) You can take (Arolsen). This medicine is sold in major pharmacies and major companies in this city. You will need to take about half a dozen. (2) You must avoid mental work and all irregular lifestyles.</p>
<p>Immediate Recovery with Treatment</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Li Ziping) A few years ago, I accidentally contracted leukorrhea and recovered immediately with treatment, but it relapses from time to time, causing me great suffering. According to my friend, old leukorrhea requires concurrent shortwave electrical therapy to be completely effective. Please tell me (1) what effect does shortwave diathermy have on gonorrhea, (2) which hospital in Shanghai has this equipment, (3) is other treatment required?</p>
<p>(Answer) (1) Shortwave diathermy uses its electrical heat to kill latent gonococci, (2) Chunzai Hospital at 66 Ningbo Road in the French Concession of this city has this equipment. The hospital's treatment of gonorrhea is very complete, (3) Other treatments are very necessary, such as injections, washing, internal medicines, etc.</p>
<p>Reddish-Black Spots</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Xu Liwen) My limbs and skin suddenly developed small spots, scattered and reddish-black, slightly raised. They break when scratched and are slightly moist. I have sought medical treatment several times, but to no avail. I am specifically inquiring in your journal, hoping you can introduce treatment methods and effective medicines.</p>
<p>(Answer) You can apply (Misluzine) to this condition. It is best to use artificial sun lamps and Cromeyer lamps. The Chunzai Hospital at 66 Ningbo Road in the French Concession of this city has both of the above machines. Three to five irradiations are sufficient for mild cases, and about ten irradiations are sufficient for severe cases.</p>
<p>Contracted Gonorrhea</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Ma Naiwen) A colleague of mine accidentally made friends with bad people and engaged in prostitution, resulting in gonorrhea. The current condition has a lot of white pus discharging from the urethra, and urination is very painful. Because he lives far away in the countryside, he has not been treated. I would like to ask your journal to introduce a self-treatment method to quickly cure this terrible disease. If you could tell me about the effective medicine, please provide the place of sale and price in detail.</p>
<p>(Answer) This is acute gonorrhea. You must strictly observe health maintenance yourself and avoid physical and mental labor. You should avoid all foods containing irritants. As for medicines, you can take Mesalin internally, about six bottles are needed. For external use, about one box of "Gono-Serol" is enough. These medicines are sold in major pharmacies and major companies in Shanghai. The former costs one yuan per box, and the latter costs two yuan and five jiao per box.</p>
<p>As Large as a Chicken Egg</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Wu Changhua) A friend of mine mistakenly stayed with a prostitute once a few days ago. Only a day later, a nodule as large as a chicken egg suddenly appeared in the groin, but it does not hinder movement. It is slightly painful to the touch. According to others, some say it is due to physical weakness, and some say it is leg dampness. After seeing a doctor, he learned that it was syphilitic bubo and that he had to seek medical treatment. I am specifically inquiring in your journal. Please tell me (1) if it is a bubo, why is it not painful, (2) in addition to using anti-inflammatory methods, can syphilis treatment be performed? Anti-inflammatory can use So-Luks lamps and external application. Among the external application medicines, such as Anfu Swelling Relief Cream, (3) The Chunzai Hospital at 66 Ningbo Road in the French Concession of this city is known for treating venereal diseases and can be visited for treatment.</p>
<p>Red Spots All Over the Body</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Chen Changlin) My younger brother suddenly suffered from a disease of red spots all over his body, but his diet is normal, and he has no pain. The red spots are like adzuki beans, flat and brown, scattered on his limbs. He has taken medicine from Chinese medicine doctors but to no avail. I am specifically inquiring in your journal. Please tell me (1) what disease this is, (2) what is the cause, (3) how to treat it, (4) which doctor specializes in it, (5) how long will it take?</p>
<p>(Answer) (1) It may be syphilitic roseola in the second stage of syphilis. Please inquire in detail whether there were any chancre or bubo symptoms of the first stage of syphilis in the past. It is best to have a blood test using the Wassermann reaction. (2) Syphilis infection, (3) Syphilis treatment is required, such as injections of 606 and secret preparations, as well as mercury and iodine drugs. They must be mixed and used depending on the condition. (4) The Chunzai Hospital at 66 Ningbo Road in the French Concession of this city is known for treating venereal diseases and can be visited for consultation. (5) Complete treatment will take about one to two months. I cannot answer how much it will cost.</p>
<p>Conversation</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Banning Strange and Seductive Clothing</h3>
<p>— Dingni</p>
<p>Last year, it was once rumored that the Guangzhou authorities were vigorously banning strange and seductive clothing, but due to poor methods, all kinds of jokes were made. This year, in the blink of an eye, spring is coming to an end and summer is arriving, and so-called strange and seductive clothing that bares the chest and arms will be on the market again. It is not surprising that the Guangzhou authorities, who are always keen on managing trivial matters and pursuing restoration, have reiterated the ban. A Guangzhou special dispatch in a newspaper on the 2nd of this month stated: "Starting from May 5th, female training officers from the Public Security Bureau will be responsible for persuasion work on various roads, and will implement it earnestly, so that no women in seductive clothing will be allowed to appear." This may be an achievement.</p>
<p>The female training officers were recruited and selected by the Public Security Bureau a month ago and have been "trained" for a long time. Now that they have this special job, it can be said that they are prepared for use. It can be seen that the authorities have worked hard, and it can also be said that they are "making a mountain out of a molehill," because they do not care about the great national crisis, but prefer to find fault with women. "Floating on a log to stir a copper spoon handle" is really boring. These are mostly the legacy of promoting restoration, reading the classics and respecting Confucius, and clinging to the old and refusing to change.</p>
<p>We do not want to discuss the big question of whether strange and seductive clothing should be banned, because it is not an easy matter to discuss. Now, let us narrow our horizons a bit and look at the feasibility of the banning method. In the special dispatch, we see that the method is exactly the same as last year, and the result is also foreseeable. If it were really effective, then the so-called women in strange and seductive clothing would not dare to parade on the streets long ago, so why would it be necessary to vigorously enforce it with compulsory measures? As for the seductive women who really wear strange and seductive clothing and parade on the streets, they are exceptions. They are kept by wealthy people like birds, and even when they come to the streets, they are in cars, accompanied by wealthy people and guards, so how dare you persuade them, let alone force them. From this, the so-called "ban" is nothing more than a bureaucratic formality that makes fun of the common people. However, such measures are much more magnificent and grand than other achievements such as "separate swimming for men and women" and "separate lanes for men and women."</p>
<h3>The Story of Raising Birds</h3>
<p>— Si Quan</p>
<p>I remember very clearly that we spent a lot of time on those little animals every day. In the morning, we would carry each cage to the corridor and hang it up, provide clean water, change the bird feed, and there was also a set of bathing procedures, but everyone did it happily. After lunch, we would take a few cages to the teahouse. Almost all of the tea drinkers there raised birds. The small room was filled with smoke and noise. They would evaluate the quality of the birds and talk about bird stories. Some would stand by the window, raise the birdcage in their hands over their heads, imitate the birds' chirping, prompting the birds in the cage to chirp too, and then happily peek at the birdcages held in other people's hands. Initially, there was no way for me to stay there for a long time, but my father remained calm. He almost completely lost his usual serious demeanor. He was able to chat and tell jokes among the bird owners. Later, my father, my eldest brother, and the cook became the three regulars of that teahouse. One day after lunch, I wanted to avoid that errand and deliberately tidied up the pigeon coop in the courtyard, but my father called out from the living room through the window:</p>
<p>"A Si, let Lao Chong (a male servant) do it. Today, take that newly bought hibiscus bird and see what that old fellow has to say: Who dares to say that my family doesn't have good birds!"</p>
<p>My father raised birds to please my eldest brother, but later, it was his competitive spirit that forced him to raise birds. My eldest brother inherited my father's personality. His leaving home was to support himself with his own strength. He didn't want to rely on his father for life. At that time, the competitive spirit of the father and son was completely placed on the birds. When they bought a</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>good bird, they would talk about that bird for three whole days.</p>
<p>But the story of raising birds didn't last for three years. One day, a neighbor's wild cat climbed up the pillar and opened a birdcage. The bird fluttered in the cage for a while and then fell to the ground. It could only jump and escape in front of the cat, unable to fly its body into the sky, and finally died under the cat's claws.</p>
<p>When my father found out, he scolded all the servants in the house. My eldest brother went to sleep very early. My father thought that my eldest brother was unhappy about the death of a bird, but the next morning, my eldest brother secretly released all the birds he kept from their cages. No one dared to question his actions, as if a great disaster was about to befall.</p>
<p>At the lunch table, my eldest brother saw that my father hadn't smiled for a long time, and he said with great guilt:</p>
<p>"They have been locked in cages for too long, they no longer know that their two wings can be spread out to fly into the sky. I feel that this is my sin..."</p>
<p>My eldest brother cried. A few days later, he drifted away again and has not been heard from since...</p>
<h3>Stubborn as a Mule 　Never Surrender</h3>
<p>— Huang Yao</p>
<h3>Death</h3>
<p>— Hei Ding</p>
<p>A cold and gloomy autumn. Again, it is raining coldly and gloomily.</p>
<p>I was tormented by the loneliness and solitude of the journey, but finally, with a worried heart, without staying changed, I left that desert-like gray ancient city and returned to that turbulent and uneasy Shenyang, which I had not seen for half a year.</p>
<p>However, I did not go home. I stayed with a relative in Xiaoheyan.</p>
<p>During the day, I never once quietly sat in his room for a while. I don't know why I want to run outside. Therefore, I no longer shout loneliness. I no longer speak of solitude.</p>
<p>One day, it was the arrival of dusk. A sudden cold wind brought a mournful autumn rain.</p>
<p>I walked back from the street. The room was unusually quiet, without any sound. Only the rain outside the window hitting the glass window made a rustling, low, fragmented sound. This situation really made me feel cold and suffocated. I glared my eyes. But my eyes were bitter, as if they had lost their light. The two beds were lying on the ground like death. On the bed by the right side of the window, there was a person lying covered with a quilt. But, on the bed on the left, there sat a person with long hair and a face covered with filth, looking like he hadn't washed his face for several months. His upper body was draped in a dirty, ragged shirt that was neither white nor black, with his left shoulder exposed and turning dark green. Three buttons were missing from the shirt, and one could see his thin chest covered with a layer of black stuff. His lower body was wearing a pair of dark black torn pants with a big hole in the buttocks; exposing flesh. He was not wearing socks, he was only dragging a pair of incomplete ragged cloth shoes without heels. His feet seemed to have been dyed by inserting them in coal ash, smeared black and black. He lowered his head. He dared not blatantly look at people. He had no spirit at all, which was no different from a dead person. The muscles of his whole body were twitching, and his fingers were softly pressing on his knees.</p>
<p>I stood by the door, they didn't see me walk in.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the person lying on the bed on the right stretched his head out from under the quilt. When I looked, it was my relative. He was irritable, angry, slapping the bed with his hand, scolding: "You, you, you this thing, there is no way to go except to die! You come to disturb me again and again... asking for money every two or three days. After getting the money, you also steal my clothes. If I hadn't come into the house today, these glasses would have been stolen by you again. You, you, if you come again, I will send you to the yamen to face a lawsuit. Get out, get out..."</p>
<p>While saying this, he got up.</p>
<p>At this time, I could see clearly that the person being scolded sitting on the left bed was also my relative. He was my relative's uncle's younger brother. He was almost crying from the scolding. He just said in his mouth: "I, I will really learn to be good this time, give me some money to quit smoking..."</p>
<h3>Spring in Pingdingbao</h3>
<p>— Kuke Basang</p>
<p>The season has reached spring, but the cold is still burning in the Mongolian plains. Although the sun rises and falls on time, the white snow on the shady side of the mountains cannot see a trace of sunlight. The rivers are gradually melting, and the ice blocks are dissipating unnoticed in the water flow under the surveillance of the sun. Day and night, sandstorms constantly attack the plains, attack the villages, and attack cattle, sheep, and camels.</p>
<p>It is already the weather in April, but one cannot smell a bit of the breath of spring in Pingdingbao.</p>
<p>There are countless people in Pingdingbao who have a kind of respect for it. That is because a heroic war once took place here a few years ago. Although the losers suffered a tragic demise, the people will never forget their heroic spirit left in the world.</p>
<p>At the distant end of the Mongolian plains, a hill protrudes from the horizon, like an island protruding from the sea. That is not an arrangement of yurts, not a Lama temple, but Pingdingbao, which has suffered from war.</p>
<p>A moat separates Pingdingbao. This moat was not born when Pangu created the heavens and the earth, nor was it left here when King Yu tamed the waters. Instead, it was dug by God's chosen people in the most recent century. Digging from the distant end to the distant end, cutting open the entire plain, just like the Milky Way in the sky. How strange! In Pingdingbao, God is particularly fond of issuing decrees. The priest forces the daughters of those who cannot pay land rent to become virgins in the church, buys and sells slaves, and for all oppression of the people, the priest always says "It is all God's will."</p>
<p>The moat, which is preserved in the world as a sacred relic, is more like a line of demarcation between fortresses than a division between people.</p>
<p>In Nanbao, the foul smell of horse manure is floating everywhere at any time. Dilapidated houses, peasants tormented by hunger and cold, herds of livestock, everything is trembling in filth. No matter when, when the peasants catch sight of the golden cross on the top of the church tower in Beibao, the sorrow on their faces is revealed, and a burst of bitterness will well up in everyone's heart.</p>
<p>Sandstorms blow over the golden cross, blow over the slums, but spring does not pity the poor! People angered by hunger will secretly curse that cross, curse the man-eating villains - the priests, who take away all the grain earned from their hard work throughout the year. If they don't take away the livestock, they still say it is a special grace bestowed by God "special grace bestowed"!</p>
<p>When the sun rises from the horizon and shoots the initial light onto the golden cross, the loud chimes will be transmitted from the top of the tower, quickly thrown over Pingdingbao, and thrown into the ears of every believer. Silent and without saying a word, everyone lowered their heads in unison, knelt down piously and began to pray to the Holy Lord. Then one can hear the hymns of the virgins, long and drawn out, with a tone mixed with sorrow, but falling into the hearts of the praying, it is always gentle and soft.</p>
<p>The climate is warming day by day, and the peasants have to go to the church to rent land for the sake of their stomachs.</p>
<p>The priests are always overflowing with smiles, and happiness blooms beautiful flowers on them. God has given them wisdom that surpasses everything, and they use their wisdom to slaughter this entire Pingdingbao. No matter how the peasants beg for rent reduction, they always compassionately explain to the peasants the hardships of the church, and they immediately kneel before the statue of the saint to pray for the peasants:</p>
<p>——Lord! Forgive them, bless them!</p>
<p>One day a notice was posted, saying that it was forbidden to plant sorghum, forbidden to plant corn, simply except for opium, nothing else was allowed to be planted! But what kind of grain should they eat to live on? God probably wouldn't know, would he? The yellow-haired, yellow-eyed priests also speak? "Rent grain must be collected in autumn!" The landlord wants to collect grain, and others call to plant opium.</p>
<p>Sandstorms constantly invade Pingdingbao, believers constantly pray, and peasants constantly go to the church to rent land. At the end of this Mongolian plains, only the spring breeze and the priests are most satisfied.</p>

<p>The Master said: "A youth, when at home, should be filial, and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should be earnest and truthful. He should overflow in love to all, and cultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time and opportunity, after the performance of all these things, he should employ them in polite studies."</p>
<p>Zi Xia said: "If a man withdraws his mind from the love of beauty, and applies it as sincerely to the love of the virtuous; if, in serving his parents, he can exert his utmost strength; if, in serving his prince, he can devote his life; if, in his intercourse with his friends, his words are sincere:—though men say that he has not learned, I will certainly say that he has learned."</p>
<p>The Master said, "If the scholar is not grave, he will not call forth any veneration, and his learning will not be solid. Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles. Have no friends not equal to yourself. When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them."</p>
<p>The philosopher Zeng said, "Let there be a careful attention to perform the funeral rites to parents, and let their memory be followed when long gone; - then the virtue of the people will resume its proper excellence."</p>
<p>Zi Qin asked Zi Gong, saying, "When our master comes to any country, he does not fail to learn all about its government. Does he ask his information? or is it given to him?"</p>
<p>Zi Gong said, "Our master is benign, upright, courteous, temperate, and complaisant, and thus he gets his information. The master's mode of asking information! - is it not different from that of other men?"</p>

<p>Mei Luo Xiang</p>
<p>In a hotel in Xiamen, there is a female performer - Mei Luo Xiang, who is staying there to escape the heat after the end of her tour. Naturally, we can see at a glance that what is keeping her there is not the cool climate, but the passionate love of Ma Ziying, a newspaper editor in the area. Therefore, even though her wealthy admirer - Bai Senqing, brought many new plans from Shanghai from afar, or to put it bluntly, a new temptation, to make her a very sincere urging, but in the end, for the sake of this love, she gained the opportunity to be a person and recognition in her new destiny, so she resolutely rejected Bai Senqing's request and returned to Shanghai alone to work hard, to struggle, looking forward to the hope that her lover promised her.</p>
<p>However, after she returned to Shanghai, all her efforts were thwarted by Bai Senqing's secret sabotage and there was no way out. She was impoverished, embarrassed, and her economic resources were completely cut off. At this juncture, Bai Senqing only used some tricks lightly, and Mei Luo Xiang had to return to his arms with tears in her eyes. People always take the easiest path to walk, especially a woman with a weak will in today's society!</p>
<p>In the two months of their second cohabitation, Ma Ziying made a fortune in Nanyang and rushed to Shanghai to marry her; Mei Luo Xiang tightly hid her pain and wanted to return to the person she loved, but how could Bai Senqing let her go? Bai Senqing announced the secret of his cohabitation with Mei Luo Xiang to Ma Ziying. In this way, the two men - Bai Senqing and Ma Ziying - both left, although they were angry, they left without any reluctance. The poor Mei Luo Xiang, hugging a broken heart, ended the play in a tragic cry.</p>
