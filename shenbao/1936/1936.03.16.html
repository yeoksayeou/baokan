<p>— 星</p>
<p>廣田弘毅以外交家受命組閣應付二二六政變後之非常局面一般觀察以此爲日本今後國策不致極端化之明徵然數日以來廣田所表示之政策無一非出于少壯派軍人之本意就外交而言對華對俄將採取積極的政策對歐對美則以協調爲表面以實利爲骨幹所謂廣田之對華三原則乃欲使中國成日本之附庸所謂蘇聯遠東軍之退出無異要求將貝加爾湖以東之地歸入日本帝國之版圖更爲求獨力對俄用兵而無後顧計日本之意頗望美國自動退出遠束據廣田之最近表示所耍求于美國者爲經濟資源之重分配爲市塲之開放及貿易之自由爲移民限制之解除此外日本更願與美國訂立雙方有利之經濟協定及政治上相互安全之條的</p>
<p>廣田能發展其外交抱負乎美國能容納此種要求乎日美關係將藉此而改善從而日本能集中精力對付中國與蘇俄乎所謂世界資源之重分配日本代表于倫敦海軍會議中曾經提出外務省發言人天羽氏屢引美國之好斯上校及前英國外相霍爾之言以爲此項要求之根據（彼等以爲强而不富之國家可與既富且强如英美者商議分享世界富源之方法）然美國天富雖饒十九在于美國本部本部以外如亞拉斯加夏威夷菲列賓及中美一帶皆日本覬覦之地美國能容許日本染指于此等區域而奪取美國產業所依賴之天產乎所謂市塲之開放及貿易之自由蓋針對美國之關稅壁壘及中南美各國之排日政策而發者然卽在此種限制之下日本對美洲之商務侵略已獲絕大之勝利據本月十日華盛頓之關稅委員會發表之報吿去年日本輸出已超過一九二九年之高度爲世界任何國所不及而輸出之增加額最大部分在於中美及南美市塲</p>

<p>慕尼黑　德元首希特勒今日在此發表濱說、謂德國將拒絕參加星期一倫敦國聯行政院會議之邀請、德國不能長受國際法庭之審判、吾人對於威脅與警吿决置不理、吾人不復能容忍决等之地位、以其易引起叛亂及國際間之仇恨與恐懼故也、如一國受仇恨之驅使、他國復爲不信任所支配、若是而求和平豈可得乎、余不欲再作姿態以損德國之榮譽、全世界均知一九一八年之德國、彼等均信彼等之待遇德國必能今也如昔、惟事實則殊不盡然、吾人之原則在於他國如能以平等待我則願與携手、否則寗願絕綠、德國深願締結由英意擔保之法德公的、規定如過糾紛、應由國聯决定誰爲侵略國、法俄締結互助公的之前、余曾决心遵守羅卡諾公約、並允簽字國自身决定誰爲侵略者、余知此時將近實施此項决定之時期、法國指稱德國爲侵略國、此後之變化如何顯而易見、多數國家現仍以德國爲一九一四年之戎首、於此可見製造流言之輕而易舉云、（十四日國民社電）</p>
<p>慕尼黑　元首希特勒今晚在此間露天廣塲發表選舉演說、（衆議院定於本月二十九日舉行改選）事前專車四十列由巴維耶省各處載運民衆三十萬人來此聽講、希特勒原定今晚八時到此、嗣爲草擬致國聯會行政院復文事、（國聯會行政院已正式邀請德國派員出席星期一日舉行之會議）、日下午京中舉行重要會議、乃延至晚間九時三十分始克蒞臨、國社黨各首領卽在「維爾偕來斯琴登」旅館開會、當由元首親臨主席、並與柏林外交部時通電話、交談不已、迨國社黨會議既畢、元首卽驅車至露天廣塲、時則三十萬民衆齊起歡呼、希特勒卽於隆隆禮砲聲中、昂首直登講台、以激越之詞發言曰、「余之要求全國民衆爲余後盾、俾得爲國家之榮譽與權利而努力奮鬭者、自一九三三年以來、今已第三决矣、余之所以重整軍備者、非爲兒戲、反之、余不願吾國受他國攻擊、故有斯舉也、夫任何民族一日不獲平等權利、則和平卽一日不能實現、此余所深信不疑者、而德國民族受人夷視、種種待遇不如他人、此則余所永久不能容許者也、」</p>
<p>希特勒次言、自德國軍隊開入萊茵河區域之後、法國卽要求德國作一妥協之表示、謂「所謂妥協之表示、未知其意云何、舉余所爲、較之表示允有進焉、則以余之言行係屬一致也、余相信世界終有綏靖之一日、但若他國對於被壓迫之民族一再橫施壓迫、使其復仇之念無時或忘、則世界之秩序安有長存之可能乎、至彼締造凡爾賽和的者、秉愚蠢之見、擅自操筆、所貽後果若何、初無先見之明、今夫各種條的簽訂之後、已有多種新頴事實、突現於吾人之眼前、故非抱犧牲之宏願、根據事實以修改現行條的、不克有濟、至若戰禍連綿永遠不輟、藉以釐正德國之疆界、此非德國之所願也」云云、先是希特勒未臨會塲之前、本城國社黨領袖華格納先向羣衆發表演說、略謂、「吾人今晚來此、蓋以全世界處僞矯詐、吾人當有以表示抗議也、元首希特勒之目的、係使德國人民回復其固有之榮譽、有以撕毀條的責備吾人者决不承受也」云云、今晚希特勒演說既畢、國社黨衝鋒隊卽舉行大規模遊行、隊員手持火炬、通過各街衢、道旁遍懸旗幟、情形至爲熱烈、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>希特勒元首頃在此間發表選舉演說、最後一段有云、「德意志乃歐洲之一偉大民族、他國務當以偉大民族待之」、羅卡諾公的在德國視之、實乃德法比三國間之「天命休戰」、（十一世紀中葉、天主敎各主敎曾在尼賽地方舉行會議、頒布法律、禁止敎徒在星期三至下星期一日之間從事暴行、是卽所謂天命休戰）至是希特勒對於法俄兩國互助公的又復加以抨擊、其言曰、「法俄·捷俄·法捷三國既已分別成立此項公約、自可隨時對德作戰、余乃德國元首對於國家負有責任、自當爲國家前途着想、又况法俄兩國互助公約成立之後、無人能保證共產主義不致禍及法國、殃及德國、」最後希特勦乃將穗國各項和平建議重述一過、幷謂衆議院定於本月二十九日改選、俾元首所行政策是優是劣、德國究係較富抑係較貧、一兀首在世界上能吾代表人民各節、均由人民表示意見、「所望人民能於是日對其元首表示信仰、俾余得昭吿全世界曰、余之言行、並非一己所得而私、實乃德國民意所由表現則可矣」云云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>倫敦據國會人士所知、關於德國廢止羅卡諾公的一舉、法國若果堅欲英國履行該的所規定之義務、則其結果將使英國內閣發生風潮、綠此項義務確屬有效、全體閣員亦所承認、惟多數閣員之抱現實主義者、因時機不適宜與輿論持異議之故、均不願英國履行其全部義務、此在艾登外相與陸特夫古貝則不以爲然、今後二人倘或迫於事勢、要求內閣探取强硬態度以對付德國、全體閣員既難同意、二人自將出於辭職一途、首相鮑爾溫稔知二人一旦辭職、則內閣在下議院中卽難取得大多數之擁護、因此頗感爲難、大抵內閣本日午後開會時、除就時局形勢有所討論外、並曾研究羅卡諾公的各簽字國談判情形、對於英國內政有何反響、傳聞現有閣員六人、主張英國內閣有所行動、對於法國所提最低限度之要求、（指萊茵河沿岸回復原狀而言）予以援助、以去就力爭、果爾則內閣之中持强硬態度者、人數現已增多矣、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>倫敦關於對德實施制裁問題、各種軍事性質之制裁辦法、如派兵佔領萊茵河沿岸區域之類足以引起戰事者、均經擯棄不用、所餘惟有經濟制裁手段、此在英國官塲人士以爲德國派兵進駐萊茵河沿岸、係屬違反凡爾賽和的第四十二四十三條之行爲、該的與國聯會盟的雖有關聯、但德國所採行動、未可卽視爲違反盟的、故依照盟的之所規定而採取集體行動、以制裁德國一層、在法理上言之、不無缺點、足被訾議也、至國聯會行政院曾於去年四月十七日通過决議案一件、主張對於破壞條的義務之國實施經濟制裁辦法、此項决議案自足引爲根據、不過經濟制裁辦法、應由行政院各理事國代表一致贊成、始可實施、此層恐難辦到耳、（十四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>— 翁文瀛</p>
<p>行政院秘書長翁文籲，曾於日前在首都祕演會沒講，其演詞現經整理竣事，茲探詰原文如下。</p>
<p>諸位先生。今天所講的題目，就是「中國地下的當源與國家的力邊」。孔子云，「工欲醬其事，必先利其器」，如果器具不好，羊作也是不會好的。我們推到其他的事，也都楚這個道理。從諭有人問孔子，建國有何條件，孔子說。為足食尼兵，民信之矣。」這句話的意思，包括丑方面。。）為翡實，兀為有準備，三為對國足有信仰。所謂食，不僅罷食糧，兵也不僅是槍砲，實以包括于切應要的材料在內。從大體上說米，就始很霏地下的鍍產，此在古時關係猶小，到近代關係就重大了，近代考古學的結論，分人類文化為三時期：　石器時期，　銅器時期，　鐵器期。這種分絃，中國古代就有的。如吳越奢秋汝越絕索聞，就有同樣的紀載。當時南方吳楚強盛，許多工作，都趁祖傳的專門工作，集中在少數人家，道些人家對於本家的勝史，都很知道？矣越以鐵鑄劍，國乃強盛。楚于問吳人風胡孑鑄兵器之伙。風胡子答曰：軍器要史分三藤代，　岌禹以玉，（肌石）為兵，　代來以銅瑪兵，角到現在乃係以鐵為兵，用鐵作軍器，國家始獲鉍盛，不過到近代文化進步，不越用鐵的時代，而是用鋼的時代了。鋼的兵器仲鐵的史叫書，我們不獨要用鋼咖且贈饗大飛的織產。機甜的來渥邵動力，動力的來派寡煤與油，向煤與油都鎚從礦麥弼來的。現在有分名的珍，都結前人所不知道的。例如銻銷的微然寧，中國字冉上就沒有絨調字，從圳人家不知道。部認認　鍋礦。湖南有一啊很朴的悌釅虫，毗略敞賜嗎山，父叫塊火的鵝子、也、字典王所沒有的。牠的發如藝銻較佩尢近，民國乏叫年間，　柱嚇南紅西發見，為竺世界第一常鑽。這爾種礦的用淪極大，允其疋在製造軍器上，是一種必要的原料。現代的國家，第一尊有大規模的生產，第二尊有動力，第三製成重要的成分。如國家沒有主耍的礦產，三件事一樣都辦不到。我現在就與國家授國際有關係的主嗎礦產講一講，允其是在中國方面，我們妥以「資人之心資己，恕己之心恕人」的標準，網看待遭惆問題。</p>
<p>鋼鐵　鋼鐵　鍍產中圾重要的東西，中國細年用鋼六十萬噸，奈世界每嘔製鋼七千萬噸。中國所用，尚不到百分之一。此七千萬噸鋼，美產佔一分之一，英產佔百分之一，穗佔百分之中一；鄭近如蘇俄，從前不到百分之二，現在產額卻已佔白分之六，日本產額的佔百分之四。但趁事有購巧，臼本鋼鐵事單的關始，眸中國他在同一時候”即的在九十年以前，光緒上二三年張之洞在漢陽設鍊鋼鍊鐵廠，同時日本也在門司附近戎八幟鍊鋼廠，日本煤鍍雖多，而可供鍊鋼對袖少，鐵砂也不併用。中國此時適因創辦化鐵派，辦費浩大，日本乃利用這一點，誰中國訂來合同，中國就利用日本的貨價，來創辦神鐵爐。日木因伶送倒合同，鐵砂忱不虞匱之樂。民山二年改訂合同，漢冷萍須供給日木鐵砂三千五百萬噸，但簽整爛的礦也小栘三千萬噸。此外安磯省繁鹹縣也有一惆戲礦，與日本訂立尖期拼砂什同，把整僩的礦，完令川售。因此檢據，鎚江一帶買給日人州鐵仲，代有二千萬噸之多。就中國令馴言，產鋤妙不過中萬萬噸，其中已賣去二千萬噸，，富瀨輸淤外國，誠足令人吃點。中國所產、萬萬噸鐵妙，就介布苜，有七萬人千萬噸在遼孵啊內，剩餘之兀萬九千萬噸叉去了二千萬呶，更覺可怕。所餘萬無千萬噸，我們如伺充分的剎用，楚一個很大的間題。日本在隊戰前產鋼不過三計萬噸，中瞰產鉍那有中五萬噸，到現在他們山三百萬噸中國一千噸都不到並且鍊鋼廠都已停辦，這梂一比較我們更加可怕。與中國情形相似費為印度，但她在我們開始用新注鍊鋼的時候，他們還在用舊然呢。不民國八年中國創辦龍煆化鐵爐，他們也創辦塔塔化鐵爐，我們請美國人設計，他們也請美國人設計，但他他們規在能崗一百萬噸生鐵，成本很低，完全是印度自己經辦的。我們呢，龍燬化鐵廠成功伏，從來就沒有開過火，相形之下，未免慚愧。本來中國對終棉鐵政策麩很重視的，我們現在第一耍自己提倡鍊鋼廠，第二鐵砂川口應由政府管理，無論何人以鐵砂售終外人時間不能過長，分量姿有斟酌，俾得供給自己的化鍊。</p>
<p>錢鎢　中國川產最多的需銻礦反錦娥，而名以銻之產分為餃富。從諭中國產銻然佔全世界百分之八十，近八年來有相當鑿化，圾近一年產景的佔令世界百分之六十左右。銻的用逮，在平時懶用以做鉛字，一不戰時，銻之用途，儿特大。因為牠的濬化的漲度甚泜，為造軍器如開化彈籌，所必不可少之物，銻的梡計，可以規國際形勢的險夷，一如寒碧表然。銻價愈高，國際形勢愈險惡，銻哎下降，國際形墾不致發生艱大險惡。銻之產額令世界為一萬六千多噸，中國州一萬二千噸，的佔四分之三，產額雖大，但形勞並不可森。中國鍊銻方絨鍛好有百之九九，九七的成份，但現在漩新的授衛，音達百分之九九·九九。墨西哥現用新泌鍊師，由美國人川售為中國之勁敞，現在政府肥介設總應付此棟局咖。</p>
<p>鵝在平時用沱很少，圾大用鐵儒鍊鋼之質腌，佃鵝則鼕。固現代兵器非有餡不可，無鷓則吃虧，做界巖鵝的國家一為中國，叉十為襯甸。全瞧界鎚之床雙為萬叫千噸，中國佔六千噸，緬匐五千噸。中國如不求進步，緬匐不久即可趕上。世界上豐鶴標撇之於中英政府之手，中閣現在以有州資尚不能鑰用。英國既可用久可賣，美穗日六叔關非向中英你買不可。但她鶴之買賣與他國關係甚大，非與普通商業可比。英國阿羅特公司從前曾要求中國政府將售鶸權讓於英國，所幸此交涉並未或功，我們應以國家利養為前提，好好的支駝牠，因為他與軍事政治實在有根密切的關係。</p>
<p>煤油　煤油除工廠用外，汽車飛機均需要汽油；汽油即從煤油提煉而成，無鍍的國家，戰時汽油極成問題，如義亞戰爭，國聯有油的制裁，倘若實行，義大利將惑到很大的困難。因之油鍍極為重要。日本全年用油二百二十餘萬噸，其中大的有四叔十萬噸，為海軍用，日本自己可供給二十餘萬噸，台灣供給三寓餘噸，庫炎島三十餘萬噸，遼罵撫順十萬噸，合計可得九十萬至六十寓噸，相差一百七十萬噸從美國貿一百萬噸，南洋七十寓噸，可以擊用。至於積蓄的汕，可以估計方怯推算得縱。據美國人與俄國入的佔計，蹴本的貯油四十萬全六十寓噸，的訂使用一年的光景，不獨油如此，銅鐵也始如此。日本每年產鋼三百寓噸，所用鐵砂除由中國朝鮮馬來購買以外，的孵四百萬噸。日本自己以腦二十萬噸，其餘均由外國買來。日本所存鐵砂的九百窩噸。一側國家對於霞要的姿源，不世緊新時耍注意，就結平時也很緊要，不然到了臨時就感覺很大的困難。國聯的集鱖安全不侵犯條的，開戰國家要對付，不開戰的山家也要對付，因此戰時向外國脾買，是鉀不容易的，那末就不能不界平時的準備了。</p>
<p>枇界各國對於礦產極為黨視，大家都從兩方氈去努力，一為極力攏高本國的小產，二為到外方供給的便利，如訂立合同條的等，在中國形勢，允為跋東，對於鐵砂頜鋼的處置，要特別注意。我們要開發牠保護牠，允其對於重要礦產的綠縱，應特別留心，一方敵嬰提恫國際貿幼，但另一方面也要貯蓄自己力量，立國終世界自己要有相賞的力量。遺種力愛來蔥，一盡人，一壽地，人要盡共力，地要權其利，以人的力量去開發地的富蝕，然後國家始觔以發住力奎。</p>

<p>— 紀難</p>
<p>二　重慶逃禮</p>
<p>重慶居揚子江嘉陵江之會，春秋時為巴子國都，秦為巴郡，唐號渝州，宋以援始名重慶。這是山坡上的城市，三面環水，形成一個半島。城西十五里的浮圖關，扼昔日成渝孔道的咽喉，為二江未合流前相距最近的地方。浮岡關四而峭壁矗立，形勢險要，為兵家必爭之地。山形窄長，好像鵝頸，市贓統仿彿鵝體。二州任的位設伊如果用上海的黃浦仕與蘇州河來此，那未嘉陵江北岸的紋北縣是閘北，而揚子江對河的南岸正像浦東。在悄形上說起來也很彷彿相似。江北是物質文明坎較低落的部份，而南岸卻是培養這都市的繁榮的農村。</p>
<p>市更街道，因山勢的起伏忽升忽降，房屋的構築也就高低不一。有上坡下坡的石級，也有現代化的馬路。有琳落的大宅院，也有最新式的洋樓。交通工具，新舊皆備，馬安上常常可以不見古色古香的肩輿與一九三六年的流線式汽車並駕齊願。公用汽車的營業非常發達，可惜管理得不很好，允共是車尾放出一股烏姻，路人只好掩而而過。渭輿是一種凍轎，對於馬路不通的狹衍僻巷是惟一代步的東西，還有一種所謂大轎子者，乃四人或六人交替抬若的高導轎子，用精緻的滕椅紮成，其轎槓的援半截特長，上坡下坡較為平穩，都是坐皋皮者，或大腹便便者所私有的。我每决看見這種轎子，前面吹喝先馭，援面急趨而前的經過，聲勢喧赫，常常引起我「彼可取而代也」的沒落意識。眞的，一個重慶的闊人，的雅臟願有一頂大轎子，而並不想一架伉錢型汽車，汽車不過是一稱玩意兒而已。</p>
<p>市政的管理，似乎太壞，較之情形相仿而同為山城的靑島和香港，眞是相差太遠，馬路上的車輛木來都靠右前進，直到後來厲行新運，綴改為靠左。現在茶至一條極狹的人行道上也分為左半右半而別來去了。公用事業，除了尾放黑姻的汽車之外，有罷燈，訊話，無錢需台，和設站售水的自來水。公園也有一所，只是還不及嘉陵汙邊任何一座軍人自己的別墅。</p>
<p>重慶大學是重慶惟一的最高學府，為劉甫澄主席所一手瓶辦。創設至今，不過四年的歷史，關於這學校一切設施，自然是不能俗以常情來批評的。不過它在嘉陵紅邊的校舍，淸麗幽僻，倒實在是一個極好的讀書地方。重慶的中等學校，如果以人口為此例來計算起來，恐怕要比上海多，數目總在三十以上。小學校更是發達，而且舊式的私塾也仍然絃歌勿輟。自然，學校多，教書匠的需要也多。然而好為入師的人之患更多，於是有所謂「六臘之戰」—寒著兩假教育界的活動。校長的任期，除山教會學校及極少數的私立學校以外，大概至多一學年。教員無所謂專任兼任，不過是校長敷衍有力者的薦書的一積應酬品而己。有一惆熟識的肌友，他任教於四所相距很遠的中等學校，每過授課四十二小時。我請教他怎樣，去授誤，他告訴我一個分身的妙法：一月中輸流在每校請假一屋期，這樣枕可以應付裕如了。</p>
<p>重慶是經濟中心，又是軍事中心。官僚，政客，巨商，富豪，都在那裹活躍著。為適應需要起見，旅含，餐館，歌場，劇院，以及所有都會應備的一叨享樂，都極度發達。都郵街是重慶的南京路，是徘貨的拍賈麥，是外商的生意眼。如果你走進一家店鋪，夥計們沈會指若什麼貨物，告訴你這是上海來的，這是下江貨。所謂上海來的下江貨渚，一半是東西洋貨。</p>
<p>川戲多為秦聲，行勝高吭，激越廖楚，江東人聽之索然無味。川菜則成都味最為著名。川菜的特點為油辣酸嫩，大多以重油一炒之後州立刻盛起，無淸燉之鈇。重慶往流湍急，水族難得，鯽魚就算珍品‘蝦蟹之類更無論矣，豬肉為每餐必具的主菜，而臘肉香腸乃惟一的家常食品。如果要想吃吃黃花魚桂魚之類，那眞是「鼻頭上掛鱟魚」了。所以一幗初來的外省人，常常有「食無魚」之嘆，四川人起身從此要吃油膩的飯菜。早餐對於他們是三餐中最重要的一餐，所以不很講究點心。午餐謂之晌午，晚餐謂之消夜，顧名思義，當然是比較决要的。允其是小孩子，因為大人要幟們早點睡覺，所以多歡是母席消夜。宴會時問，普通定在下午二一時，而事賞上必須等到六七點銳，攙能舉著。</p>
<p>四川一向以天府之國聞名，物巖特多。川黔邊規深山中所產的銀耳，最為人所稱道，以大而色白微黃者為佳。上海市上雪白的一稱，雖然好看，而其質已遜。嘉定大綢和成都錦緞，都是有名的產品，陝西街一帶商店都有出售。</p>

<p>— 趙君豪</p>
<p>自本月二日抵漢以後，迄於今日（六日），凡五日矣，每日均在陰霾之中，未嘗一見陽光，友人吿余，湘省時時下雨，一年之中，幾有三分之二以上之時日陰雨，若陰晦而無日光，已可謂爲晴天，君當引以爲幸，母弗知足也。六日晨余等乘竹轎游山，先至祝聖寺，建築雄偉，古木蒼翠，流連片刻，便爾退出。出寺後，轎夫以余體重，請增一轎夫，笑謂余曰：「你福氣很大呢」，余初不解其意，嗣經仲樹聲君吿我原因，不禁筦爾！自祝壽寺前進，沿途見水田甚多，有溪曲折流亂石間，漸聞水聲，如走奔雷，半小時後，至水簾洞，爲一瀑布，自高而下，聞其源在祝融峯，瀑形不肥，但輕明若簾，瀑旁大石上鐫有不舍畫夜，高山流水，何去何從等字。游水簾洞後，更經行若干時，至南嶽市，所謂南嶽市者，係南嶽廟前之街市，聞自唐宋以來，游山及燒香者均於此駐足，日久繁盛，遂以成市，市中各種店鋪俱有，而舊式旅店允多，七八月間，四方香客，至南嶽進香，泰半住滿。自此卽入南嶽廟，廟貌崇閎，不亞於杭州之靈隱寺，甬道極長，松柏成行，極爲美觀。最特別者，係大殿四周，均繞以長廊，共建築方法，與北平故都之宮殿相同，長廊四周，圍以石欄杆，欄杆石板，均有浮彫，所作樹木花鳥，無不精巧。聞每年來此進香者，總數在二十萬人以上，卽江浙一帶如上海，蘇州，杭州等處亦有多人前往，可謂盛矣。余等自南嶽廟後登山，山路皆新築成之馬路，極易行走，其情狀與莫干山之新路相同，惟遠望山頂積雪皚皚寒風撲人坐轎中，戰慄不已。行未久，卽至絡絲潭，爲另一瀑布，水聲宏大，瀑凡數折，較水簾洞爲美觀也。自此前進，經玉版橋，地勢益高，氣候益寒，視上海隆冬天氣爲允甚，是時且飄雪花，余等冷不可耐，呌苦不已，更前進若干里，方達半山亭，蓋自山麓至山頂，此爲一半也。卽至中國旅行社招待所，圍爐進膳，寒氣大消，此地有房間十餘，爲全山最勝處，夏季這署，不亞於匡廬，今年夏季，卽可開放云。膳後以天寒路滑，雪又未止，不能再上，乃循山之陽另一新路下山，此段因向陽關係，樹木較多，風景亦漸勝。途中經磨鏡臺，左近有湘省主席何鍵所建之別墅。更下，游福嚴寺及南臺寺，依山建築，環境均佳，南臺寺中且有日本僧人所送藏經五千餘卷，庋藏小樓書橱中，有石碑紀述其事。此外又有貝葉佛像三十二張，繪工精緻，名作也。余等至是乃下山，仍至山麓之旅行社招待小憇。</p>
<p>綜觀南嶽之勝，在於博大雄奇，寺觀古跡，散置各處，非一覽無餘者可比。山高凡三千餘尺，允宜於消夏，兼之湘省府設局管理一切，前途頗有希望。凡自漢口來游者、可由長沙乘汽車至山、自廣東來者，可由衡陽換車至山云。余等在旅行社小憇後，卽由株韶局楊主任裕芬伴同乘汽車至衡陽，凡行二小時而達，至衡陽城外，渡江至江東岸，卽宿於楊君寓所。</p>
<h3 id="c89">靑海旅行紀（續） <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— 莊學本</p>
<p>土人是蒙族</p>
<p>我們現在對於靑海士人種族的源流，可以下一個蒙古種的結論：</p>
<p>過去有一部份人說他們是沙陀國李克用的後代，所謂沙陀國—就是現在新疆的沙陀；在迪化綏來阜康孚遠奇台等縣的西北，長五百里，廣三百里，現名古爾班通古特沙地。唐稱沙陀。在蒲類之東，金婆山之陽，屬於西突厥的別部。及後又附於回鶻。—道一種說數，因爲李土司是李克用的後代關係，但是這僅屬於少數貴屬，而不能附會於多數的土著人民，併且其中有很多的土司，是蒙古的，是江南的。査李土司的家譜，自元朝梅的古管祿吉兄弟分茅紅崖溝，及明朝李英李雄弟兄進會寗伯高陽伯永遠世襲。當時均稱土民，現在靑海的人們也都稱他爲土人，所以他們是道地的靑海土著民族，而不是外來的移民，已經很淸楚。</p>
<p>現在西莊人呼他們爲「卡龍」而他們自稱又叫「蒙古兒」。他們的語言　用蒙古語。他們的骨格偉大壯健，有黃色的皮膚，黑色的眼瞳，厚厚的嘴唇。他們的鄉鄰又靠近着蒙族，在這幾點顯著的特徵上，很可以證明他們是蒙古民族的一支。</p>
<p>他們過去隨着他們的土司有很光榮的戰史，歷朝平定西陲的邊亂，也都有他們的功勞。因爲過去他們長於武事，所以現在他們文化落後，懶於耕種。然而他們有忠厚的性格，强壯的體魄，聰明的頭腦，秀麗的面龐，如果政府能施以相當的敎化，他們就可以恢復過去的光榮。</p>
<p>士民的統計</p>
<p>以上據縣府二十二年調査，的計五千八百餘口。最近之人數則無法統計。</p>
<p>靑海土民除以互助爲中心地外，其散居之面積尙有大通西寗共和民和樂都等五縣。惟大多漢化不易分別。其靑海全省土人人口的總數，依作者的估計約二萬至三萬人。</p>
<p>互助縣土司</p>

<p>納土司本蒙古種族，明洪武四年沙密率部落投誠，授總旗，沙密之子納速刺，永樂元年以功陞副千戶，至六世孫納榮嘉靖間襲職，以功陞指揮僉事，至九世納如言，萬歷三十一年襲職後，陞固原提標游擊，淸初，納如言之子納元標，順治二年歸附，十年襲指揮僉事職。嗣後子孫世襲，今住西寗縣南十二里納家莊，現又寄居西川，互助縣屬東有管轄納家東園等莊土民在焉。</p>
<p>陳土司本江南山陽人，其始祖陳子明者，元淮安右丞也，明洪武元年授指揮，子明之子陳義，洪武十七年襲職，以功調陞西寗衛指揮使，至六世孫陳治襲職，兼管營中軍事，後陣亡，贈都指揮同知職，至十世孫陳光先，萬歷間襲職，歷陞莊浪左參將，淸初陳光先之子陳師文，順治二年歸附，九年襲指揮使職，以功陞念口守備，詞後子孫世襲，今住互助縣西區陳家臺。</p>
<p>吉土司本蒙古族，有吉保者，明洪武叫年歸附，授百戶，調錦衣衛前所鎭撫，至孫吉祥，永樂二十年襲職，以功陞指揮僉事，淸初吉天錫噸治二年歸附，十二年襲指揮僉事世職，住西寗縣西六十里吉家莊。（上錄「最近之靑海一）</p>

<h3 id="c135">東華九人作戰　比三敗於法商　李寧李義臣周光中三人受傷　法商表演平平勝來並不光榮 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>東華法商兩足球隊在西聯甲組聯賽中、俱有優越之地位、昨日會師逸園、有關錦標得失之重要性、故雙方各謹慎從事、咸以最强之陣容出戰、不意東華禍起倉卒發生不幸之重大犧牲、李密李義臣及周光中先後受傷離場、最後祇以化人作戰、滿腔希望、化爲一股懊惱、五千觀衆、亦隨之垂頭喪氣、且二李一傷手腕、一傷頭額、恐非短期所能痊愈、是賽遂以一比三慘敗、</p>
<p>三將受傷</p>
<p>起首之五分鐘內、戰情異常激烈、在極度迅速之精彩表演中、博得觀衆熱烈之美讚、不料正當此時、李寗因救球失脚、身體傾斜跌倒、手腕受傷甚重、就此離場、東華一方面既感損失主將之痛惜、一方面繼續努力進攻、聲勢依舊吒盛、但在半小時時、李義臣（原任內衛）用頭頂球、同時法商中鋒勞勃斯篤夫衝上用脚撈球、踢中李之額角眉端、東華失此二員主將、從此一蹶不振、又在下半時十分鐘際、周光中亦因脚傷而出、從此成一面倒之形勢、</p>
<p>僥倖獲勝</p>
<p>法商固已八戰八勝、但咋日表演、殊覺平平、在東華如此殘敗之情形中、並未有特殊之發展、人材固甚齊整、聯絡上缺點甚多、時被東華諸將、擾亂其後方陳地、現出促侷不安之狀、前鋒亦散漫無序、所勝三球、並非用乾脆淸晰之脚勁射入、即在東華九人之陣容下、祇勝三球、而未能加大其比數、祇表示一僥倖的勝利者而已、</p>
<p>局勢一瞥</p>
<p>東華在李髯受傷後、即由賣幼良攻入法商一球、局勢極爲興奮、東華並不以李寗之受傷而减少其戰鬥力、此後佔領優勢達二十分鐘、始被法商右翼華特之巧遞、由勞洛斯篤夫衝上斜射命中、造成和局、此後義臣即受傷、東華繼續掙扎、再接再厲法商仍奈何不得、直至四十分鐘時、被傑梅華特再中一球、上半時二比一結束、以後東華作困獸之鬥、各人加倍努力、全場奔馳、負起攻守兩重責任、卒以力量單薄、呼應不及、叉在敵中鋒之脚下、失去一球、法商處處顯露散漫及庸弱之姿態、從此竟不能再加大其勝球數矣、雙方陳綫如下、</p>
<p>三塲棄權</p>
<p>昨日甲組五塲、除東華法商之賽、及葡萄牙預先聲明棄權於優游者外、又有兩場棄權、西商對西捕、西捕棄權、蘭開夏對猶太、猶太棄權、餘一場臘克斯則以五比一勝沙壳爾、棄權者如是之多、將使以後之聯賽、减少興趣、甲組現狀如下、</p>

<p>西聯足球會乙組聯賽、優游乙對英海車、咋日下午二時在延小路申園足球場交鋒、優游乙實力甚强、於乙組杯賽中、攻無不克、戰無不利、昨對英海軍之戰、勝利早在意料中、而英海軍最近練習甚勤、成績猛晋、上週且曾以三對二擊收東華乙、然與優游相較、終遜一籌、昨日優游起用大批新將、上半時以純熟之合作一對〇佔先、下半時英軍抱雪恥雄心、圍攻甚烈、幸優游後衛嚴密、未遭毒手、乃各無建樹而終、結果優游以一球勝、</p>

<p>西聯足球會丙組聯賽、靑華會對俄軍、昨日下午二時在逸園足球場角逐、靑華趁前日以五對一戰勝華捕之餘威、原可一鼓作氣力摧俄軍、孰料敵軍頑强異常、上半時全軍聯袂進攻、竟以　對〇佔先、下半時靑華會變更戰略、果然局　變幻、由戈錫佐攻入球、造成和局、</p>

<p>「莫響！莫響！」孩子們都喊道，接着只是一片的肅靜，因爲那童子羞怯的態度和，懇切的眼色，使個個人均欲靜靜諦聽。</p>
<p>裴氏夫婦以爲他總要彈一闋他所熟知的曲調，可是，最使他們驚奇的，他們竟聽到了一個新鮮而可愛的曲調，彈得很悠揚而溫柔，他們童不容易相信是乃德在彈奏着。那是沒有字而却能動人心弦的一個曲調，歌唱着人間一切的想望和快樂，使聽到這純樸的音樂的得到了安慰和忻愉。梅格姨母俯伏在小橋的肩上，外婆擦她的眼淚，蜀夫人仰看勞笙先生，以感動得不能成聲的語詞輕輕說道：</p>
<p>「那是你製的樂譜。」</p>
<p>勞笙俯頭回答她道：「我吩咐過你的這個童子，要他好好表演可以爲你的榮光，並且以他自己的方法來表示對你的謝意。」</p>

<p>— 魏友棐</p>
<p>低金利問題在現在，政府與商業機關共同的研討，銀錢兩業各別地組織小組委員會，籌議减低金利的辦法，結果是怎樣的呢？所能聽到的只是一種行動的記載而已，却從沒有看到具體施行的辦法。硏究所以遲疑不决的理由，並不簡單地由於「茲事體大」，而實由於實際上的困難。</p>
<p>一般經濟形態上的低金利時代，表示兩種意義：一種是表示那時正在經濟衰落的過程中，一種是表示經濟復興初期。也可以說低金利是由經濟衰落時代走入經濟復興時代的一種階梯。金利的高下，也不外乎一般的供需情形，所以金利的低下，就表示那時間對於資令需要的减少，一切經濟活動在减縮中。經一八六零年到大戰爆發爲止，英國的勞工失業率，以一八七九，一八八六，一九零九諸　爲最高，失業的百分數，爲百分之十一，百分之十，百分之八；而英蘭銀行在這幾年中的重貼現率，一八七九年平均爲百分之二·五，一八八六年爲百分之三，一九零九年爲百分之三·二五。這一個例，可以證明金利的低下，與失業率的增高，適在一個相反的比例之下。進行着的。</p>
<p>但這一種低金利的表示，與今日的中國經濟情形顯有不同。前者是說明低金利是跟着社會經濟狀態而移動的，後者則是想利用這一條路到達經濟復興的目的。</p>
<p>根據鐵業月報的統計，恐慌過程中近六年來上海德平均利率如下：十九年每千元日息為七分，二十年爲一角三分，二十一年爲八分，二十二年爲六分，廿三年爲六分，二十四年爲一角四分。利息最高的一年就是恐慌最深刻的一年。這一種事實，與上面所舉的例剛正相反。英國的低金利所表示出來的是經濟衰落，而我國則爲相反的情形。這理由是爲英國是宗主國，他們的金融組織是健全的，各種產業又有許多殖民地做尾閭，所以在經濟衰落中所感覺到的是生產過剩，資金呆滯；我國是一個次殖民地經濟的國家，產業及金融組織均不健全，一般資金又未必用之於生產，因此在恐慌中所感到最困難的是信用收縮，英國在那一時期，工廠在休息中，不需要資金的運用，所以利率低下，我國在這一時期中，因信用收縮，工商業者。需要資金的接濟而難達到目的，所以利率漲高。因此就本問題說來，假若减低我國的利率，以求經濟的復興，這一個原則是對的。</p>
<p>生產事業的資本，大都仰給於借欵的運用，借欵利率的高低，亦即生產成本的高低。所以低金利政策，是足以减少生產成本，促成生產事業的進展的。</p>
<p>我國的市塲利率所以高勗的原因，是都市的畸形發展，資金不由於正當的運用而造成的。自從都市金融絕端膨脹以來，資金壅積着沒有出路，於是大多數趨於投機之一途。最容易舉出的是地產，公債，標金，物品。這一種投機的利潤的優厚，都在一般的工商業以上，都市金融膨脹的表現。就是幾年來銀行的增設，正規的工商業放欵所得之利息，自然不及投機的厚，因此都拾此而就彼。同時銀行爲增殖其利潤計，就不得不用高利來吸收存欵，作爲其投機的資本。上海市塲每年在衰落中，國民經濟每年在衰落中，而銀行事業的利潤始終站在不敗的地位。時代的變易，信用逐漸收縮，都市的地產價格，隨着經濟蕭條而下落，大量從事投機者，就感覺到信用凍結的痛苦。因信用的深刻化，又發生了擠提的情形，使銀行的基礎發生動搖，其唯一的出路，仍在用高利手段去吸收存欵，以增厚其根基。地產是下落了，而其他的投機方針，依然層出而不窮，銀行爲什麽「舍此勿由」呢？工商業者要希望資金的周一轉，眞是難乎其難了。</p>
<p>而在農村的一方面呢。因了資金的流出，農產品的跌價，天災人禍的紛至沓來，使支付的籌碼大感缺乏。資金已集中到都市上，農作物跌價與歉收要招致資金的回來是很困難的，農民在這困難的局面下，從那裹取得資金呢？據中央農業實騐所的調查，農民借貸的來源，佔百分數最大爲富農，决爲商家與地主，合作社只佔了百分之一而已。正式的金融機關既是沒有，那末要希望公平的利率當然是一種理想，要求貸欵的農民們，只得掙扎於高利貸之下了。</p>
<p>高利貸之在我國是一種事實，其妨害工農也是事實，那末，要求低金利當然也不能說是不合理的事，但是在實際上的問題實還很多。</p>
<p>本報前載盛克中君「從銀行利率到减息問題」一文，申述减低利息的意見，並提出一個假定的最高與最低的標準利率，計爲普通與儲蓄一年存欵率均爲六厘，放欵利率爲月息五厘至七厘。盛君的意思，以爲工商業放欵的來源由於銀行，存欵的利率實在是銀行放欵利率的成本，所以先求存息的减低。照其所定的利率而論，和先進各國相比，顯然是還覺高得多了。</p>
<p>現在從銀行方面說到减低利息，先有有許多困難。最顯明的是儘有許多的高利的投資在前，不必向放欵尋出路，那是沒法糾正的。即以公債而論，自從政府統一了以後，利息是减低了一些，但無論如伺，總在八厘以上，而其穩健的成分也在一般的投資以上的。</p>
<p>銀行的資本也是一種成本，這一種成本的利率就是股息。通常股息的利率是六厘到八厘，假定要减低利息的話，則在存欵的利息减低以外，叉須顧到了股息。股息固然也可以减低，但是本來在商業證券中不佔若何地位的銀行股票，恐怕更因此而要貶値的。</p>
<p>資本的逃避，也是一件可慮的事。我們沒有見到洋商銀行改訂存欵的消息嗎？在報紙上的登載，說明是减低的，但就實際說來，不但不是减息，而月還是加息。我們從前不聽得洋商銀行的拒收存欵嗎？不聽得洋商銀行的不給存欵利息而予以「白存」嗎？現在的改訂利率，適成其爲增加而已，在這低金利的提倡中，是一件可注意的事。雖說國人近來對於常識已有長足的進步，對於洋商銀行也沒有從　的信任了，但是在幣制改革以後，一般資產階級購存外幣，購存外貨，窖藏金塊，已是習見不鮮的事，那末，利率一經减低，許多存戶的存欵，華商銀行與洋商銀行之間，相去無多，爲什麽不去此就彼呢？</p>
<p>中國的社會情形跟各國的情形不同，封建社會的形態，還未完全脫離，所以民間的高利，高至百分之百，在窮鄉僻野，是毫不足怪的。减低金利一事，在都市的銀行，雖可以用統一辦法，一律减低，而民間的高利貸，必定無法制止。實際這一種民間的高利貸，給全國經濟所生的影響，比都市的高利貸的影響還大。在都市尙可以用高利貸的方法獲得資金；而農村上即使願意　到高利，却還有無法獲得的苦痛的呢！</p>
<p>我國實業界所受到的苦痛，實際是得不到資金的問題，而不是高利低利的問題！實業界需要資金的接濟是事實，需要低利的借入那是更好的了，但是現在是一個凍結的局面下，假定，低金利下實業界仍得不到資金運用的便利，將採用如何的辦法呢？所以我國實業界在現在所受到的最大的苦痛，是怎標打開根本上信用凍結的局面問題，而不是區區利率上的問題</p>
<p>銀行界不肯從事於正規的投資，不供給工商業的資金，是由於投機事業，或半投機性的投賣利潤的優厚，所以要使投資到正規的路去，必須先從嚴厲取締投機减低債息入手。至於實業界的出路，實在於擴充證券範圍開拍商業證券，造成一個工商業的長期資金流轉的市場。不必一定要仰給銀行的鼻息了。</p>
<p>民間高利貸的形成，其最大的理由，仍因看我國的金融機關，太注重於國際商品市場的都市，而忽略了農村，因此，農村金融機關的普設，也是一件必不可省的事。溝通都市與幾村的金融，這是大家應該負責的事。</p>
<p>總之，實行低金利是通國有利的事，但站在今日之經濟情形立場，如果說利息减低就是工商業的唯一的出路，就是經濟復興的實現，這未免太簡單了吧。</p>
<p>本文寫好了以後，看到銀行公會小組會對於减息方面發表兩點意見：（一）請求政府貶低公債的利息，（二）要求中央銀行揭示低息。（二月二十七日申報）這意見雖未明白表示低金利的必不可行，却是表示低金利相當需要的條件。我們以爲低金利是資金供應狀態的一種表示，若是想從低金利去求得資金她緩狀態，以今日中國金融市場下，不獨事實上的困難，並且是倒果爲因的事。—二月二十七日—。</p>
<h3 id="c158">論資金積蓄與利率水平 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— 予夐</p>
<p>資金太貴，一般公認是我國產業不能發展的癥結所在。因此創造低廉的資金市塲，成爲近來公私努力的目標。低利政策的實行，一般均認應從减低政府的公債利見人手。自政府統一公債的辦法公布後，利息仍爲六厘，較前未見如何减低。一般議論，因是又病政府政策的不激底。但吾人以爲這裹應該研究的第一個問題是人爲的削减利息，是不是可能的？</p>
<p>一個社會中的利息水平，是種種客觀環境决定的。然大體言之，主要的是取决於供給和需要兩項。在資金積蓄豐富的社會，資金的供給充足，且彈性甚大，所以利率水乎一般的低下，季節的變動也比較的不甚顯著。反之，在經濟落後，資金積蓄薄弱的國家，資金的供給不甚充裕，且缺乏伸縮彈性，故利率水平一般的爲高，且季節變動，甚爲顯著。再從需要方面言，在景氣的時候，物價高漲，產業活躍，實業家羣起活動，利率水平，必被提高。在某種季節，某種事業特殊活潑，也可將利率水平壓高，這就是所謂的金融季節。又如地方上某一件事業的投資，特殊有利，如幾年前的地產然，以致社會資余的活動，趨於一途，結果也可使利率水平提高。一個社會中的利率，大體都是道樣由供需關係决定的。假如供需的關係不變，而由人爲的方法把利息减低，結果是怎麽樣的呢？擁有資金的不願意投出，或竟投到傍的地方去，資金的供給愈見减少，其結果必至演成經濟的長期衰落，永遠跟不上人家。所以不自然的减低利息，在經濟上是不健全的手段。</p>
<p>並且，就歷史的經騐，人爲的壓低利息，時常不能達到目的，而成爲一種無效的努力。例如吾人把公債利息减低爲三厘，則公債市價，可能的降至三十一二元，結果合見還是在一分左右。假如把公債利息抬至八厘，則公債市價可能的高至八十四五元，結果合息還是一分左右。所以在其他環境沒有改變之前，公債市價將自行升降以適應利息，符合某一定標準的利率。單純的提高或减低公債利息，終無效果。</p>
<p>就過去和現在的事實考察，「一分」似將成為我國公債市場中最經常的利率，而六十至七十元，殆將成為我國公債之最經常的市價。一分利息，或許是我國資金市塲中比較近乎自然的利息。我國資金積蓄尙在幼穉時期，資金較貴是必然的。因爲此，可以鼓勵一般資金的積蓄，使吾人資金的積蓄能與他國立於同一水淺。所以我國利率與他國比較，只要不是懸殊太甚，稍高是無碍的，並且才是自然的。</p>
<p>一分利息，從工商業的立塲看，還是太重。例如外國衣料一件，質地完全和我們的相同，但他們負擔的利息成本只有二角，我們的却要高到一元以上，這樣，在市場中我們的產品顯然的是處於不利的地位，所以逐漸抑低國內利率，以達於國際利息水準，是必要的。我們所要討論的第二個問題，即如何而後能够達到這種目的。</p>
<p>利率水平的高低，大體既取决於資金的供給和需要，我們要使我國的利率水平逐步降低，便要從這兩方面去設計。假如吾人能够一面增加資余的供給，一面節的資金的用途，吾人的目的，便可逐漸的達到。所以在低利政策的前提之下，吾人要提出兩點，一是鼓勵資令的積蓄，一是統制資金的用途。</p>
<p>没有積蓄，决無所謂資金，資金是從積蓄中來的。人們以生產所得的一部，不作消耗之用，而投放於生產事業，讓其再作生產，這就是資金。所以資金的意義就是生產所得之再生產。在經濟發達的社會，人民生產的能率甚高。生活的餘裕較多，所以資金的積蓄能率也愈大，資金的供給自然愈覺豐足，利率水平亦愈見低下。反之，在經濟落後的社會，人民生產率甚低，日之所入，不足以自糊其口，自然沒有什麼餘裕可供積蓄，利率水平，不能免的要較高。所以利率問題，根本就是資金的積蓄問題。而我國當前最大的困難，在於生產資金的缺乏。利率的高漲，是生產資金缺乏的結果，並不是原因。吾人當前的問題，在如何鼓勵資金的積蓄。這個問題解决之後，傍的問題，自會隨着解决。稍高的利率水平，並不足爲病，而且是鼓勵人民資金積蓄的一個辦法。</p>
<p>其次，統制資金用途，亦是低利政策的前提之下所必採的手叚。資金是經濟活動的基礎，也可以說是人類生存的立足點。假如積蓄下來的資金不用於生產事業，那嗎，不單利率提高，即人類的生存也將成爲不可能，所以如何統制資金的運用，成爲一般必採的政策。不過因爲時代的不同，採行的程度稍有分別罷了。古人的興漁鹽之利，發山林之藏，無非是對資金活動的一種統制方策。再如幾年前的所謂產業的合理化，無非在控制資金的活動，使作最有效率的生產。至於近時所盛倡的統制經濟，分柝內容，也無非是在對資金的動作方向，作嚴格的管理，使合乎社會國家的需要。在經濟落後，資金薄弱的國家，統制資金用途允爲必採的政策。倘放任資金作無政府式的活動，則生產成爲無政府式的生產，結果是很危險的。非生產的事業，分散資金的用途，是應該加以制止的。例如地產把數十萬萬資金固結着，牠本自並無直接生產的效果，這種事業是應該制止其發展的。不健全的產業，往往把資金作不必要的浪費，道種產業是應該促其改進的，使資金都能够發揮牠生產的效能。無希望的產業，把有用的資金凍結着，逗留着，這種產業是應該消除的，以免把有用的資金作無希望的浪費。又如爲着他不生產的目的而舉債，搶奪生產的資金，是應該禁止的，以免把生產的資金用作不生產的，甚而是作破壊生產的支出。所有的資金，都應該用於生產之途，而且都能作最有效率的生產。這就是吾人今後應採的政策。惟有如此，而　資金的積蓄能力可以增進，資金的大量積蓄，才有可能。資金積蓄充足而後，社會的利率水平才能够自然降低下來。</p>
<p>社會中資金的積蓄沒有增加，而只人爲的削低利息，這是捨本而逐末，是不自然的。不但無效果，並且是有害的。吾人認爲我國當前產業問題的癥結，不在利率水平太高，而在所積蓄的資金不够應用，在僅有的一些資金浪費於不生產之途。當前解救的道路，只有鼓勵資金的積蓄與統制資金的用途。不此之圖而空言减低利息，是無濟於事的。</p>
<h3 id="c159">一九三五年的上海房地產 <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— 徐進</p>
<p>在一九三三年，上海的房地產，曾因爲都市游資充斥和一般投機的在熱，有漸見興旺的　况，常年的地產成交額爲四三，一三六，〇〇元，雖然比「一二八」事變以前的黃金時代（即一九三一年）减少一萬三千餘萬，但是比起一九三二年來，則已有一千八百餘萬的增加了。無疑地，當時的上海房地產確有一度欣欣向榮。</p>
<p>不過不幸得很，到了一九三四年，這　綫希望趁中絕了，　因爲房地產進樣東西，畢竟要有人居住才能生出租息來，這就是說，它畢竟要跟工商業盛衰爲轉移，而中國經濟到了一九三四年是病態百出了，上海一市何能例外。　美國的購銀政策，在一九三四年（允其是下半年）雷僅風行起來，使正犯着金融膨脹病的上海，感到銀根空虛和緊迫的威脅，這樣地價就狂跌不已，甚至變爲無人顧問的死物。以前醉心「道契」的銀錢業，當時都吃了苦，皆因巨額地產押欵無法周轉而宣吿倒閉。因而地　救濟問題就變成萬分的嚴重！</p>
<p>一九三五年春，上海地產商人爲自身脫累起見，倡議以地產爲擔保，發行地產證券五萬萬元，使死了的地產可以復活轉來，但結果是失敗了，八月間他們又計劃創辦　產交易所，想使地產在拍板塲中重生起來，結果父是失敗了！這是不足爲怪，犯了死症，雖有盧扁，是不能復生的呀！英國紳士，上海的地產大王沙遜爵士，爲了彌補他銀庫中的空隙，在去年春天也主張發行鎊票，來抵禦白銀政策的侵襲，使地價能繼續上漲，結果因「時機未熟」，暫歸泡影。不過沙遜爵士的意見畢竟要比中國地產商强得多了，它兼有國際貨幣戰的氣息，英皇左右是不會等閒視之，因此羅斯來華了，鎊票計劃，也透過新貨幣制度而大體實現出來了！</p>
<p>當然，我們不是說新法幣和鎊票是一樣東西，不過我們也不願盲目地吾認它們之間的血緣關係；同時我們也不是說羅斯來華策動新貨幣政策是完全應了沙遜爵士的要求，我們只認爲該項政策對於沙遜爵士的地產，亦很有效勞的地方而巳！因爲新法幣出世以後，財部就可少管一分存銀涸竭的苦惱，而多享一分發行紙幣的自由，不僅財政數字可以暫吿中衡，就是一般銀根亦可鬆動起來了，這樣地產不是可以趁機復活起來嗎？我們且聽Arther和Sopher兩人的解釋吧！他們在上海泰晤士報上這樣笑嘻嘻寫道：</p>
<p>「不論中國政府將來能吾支持它的新貨幣政策，假使其它情形不變，地產市場都將向上發展。因爲新法幣如果成功了，那末充裕的新法幣和靈活的信用都要跑到地產方面來找賺錢的出路。假使新法幣失敗了，那末地產也可因投機交作而再興旺起來。所以投資地產的時機確是成熟了！」</p>
<p>按之事實，亦正如此。在十月以前，地產交易非常淸淡，六月間普益地產公司更因地產衰落而破產；可是到十一月以後，情形大不同了，地產成交額激急增加起來，詳細可閱下表：</p>
<p>一九三五年上海地產成交數額表（單位元）</p>
<p>從前表，我們立刻可以看出全年一千四百餘萬的成交額中，差不多有一半是屬於十一十二兩月份的。所以按全年看起來，其成交額雖僅較一九三四年增加二百餘萬，並不能指示地產業有何好轉，但就最來兩月看來，則確有顯著的生氣了。</p>
<p>十一十二兩月，地產成交額突然加增，與華僑匯欵的猛增也有關係，不過這後者本身也是由新法幣造成的。因爲新法幣的對外匯率，一致較前降低，這使華僑匯欵在折算之下就增加了不少。據香港華商銀行公會主席李道南氏最近給與羅斯爵士的答復，一九三五年的華僑匯欵比前年的增百分之四十（見二月十九日香港工商日報）。而這些匯欵因國內經濟日益衰落之故，大半都楚用來購置房產的。</p>
<p>新貨幣政策的頒佈，據當日財部的宜言，是用來復興工商。關於這點到底有了怎樣的成績，我們暫且不說，不過上海的房地產業確是相當「復興」了；沙遜，哈同以及一般房地產主都將深表謝意，但從民族經濟的前途看來，這未見太可痛心了！要曉得房地產抬頭以後，社會資金就不曾再注意到薄利的甚至飄搖的工商業身上去了！</p>
<p>去年的房地產業所以有轉機之象，還有兩個附帶的原因亦須指出。第一是上海銀錢業公會暨市商會三團體發動修改抵押權法，即房地產抵押期滿，若不淸償，受押人即可自動抬賣，而不必和以往那樣，須先向法院訴請核定。第二是財部迭令中國建設銀公司創設不動產抵押銀行，加强並擴大房地產的抵押範圍，這兩件事雖然直到現在還在進行，但是刺激地產活潑起來的力量，則早是發生了。這兩件事情，很明白地都是由銀錢業者以及一般地產商人所策動，單就這事本身而言，也無可訾議之處，不過他們忘了最根本的問題，而來舍本逐末，實是不容放過的。</p>
<p>一九三五年上海的房地產中要靠了新貨幣政策的福，是有了相當的生機了，但是整個國民經濟依然沉淪在恐慌之中，這是我們不應忘記的一個對照呀！我們有什麼權利來跟沙遜學笑呢！　—一九三六年三月一日夜</p>

<p>— （肖白）</p>
<p>恐懼，是人類最大的敵人，一切所謂不安、憂慮、膽怯、驚慌，實在都是恐懼的變相，它剝奪了人們的幸福，削弱了人們的能力，它會使人益趨懦弱和無用，而使人失敗。</p>
<p>社會的演進，和人類的努力，於現下，在我們每一個事業的進展上，實在都已沒有恐懼和遷延的必要性，我們要知道。只有迎頭趕上去，積極地準備和充實，勿遲疑、勿觀望。發出最大的力量，那纔是獲得生路，找求光明的途徑。</p>
<p>所以我們可以說：『遷延是誤事的罪魁，恐懼更是人類一切事實的破壞者。』凡是遷延一分，實在就是使事難做一分，而恐懼一分，就是使人更失去了一分實現的可能性。</p>
<p>「要做，立刻做去」！我願大家服膺這句成功人的格言。</p>

<p>銅匠吳，贛人也。少時曠達自放，肆世傲志，不以名利爲念。富膂力，嘗與鄉里兒搏擊，眾咸披靡。其舍旁有石擔二，以雙臂運之，二擔騰起，無稍駑態。鄰爲某大令所居，聲勢赫奕，不可一世，出時輒張旗傘，僕從如雲，吳見而詛曰；「何張炫乃爾！汝以官而驕人，官果何足爲。官者，民僕也，雖九五曷能越乎此，吾志殊不樂爲。同行兒哂之，目爲狂且。未幾大令以肩輿傷人，其人之妻求撫卹，不許，笞之，逐使去。吳揎臂呼曰：「傷人者抵罪，若忝列大令，得悖法耶！吾當擊殺若！」其父母嚮不直之，目爲霸悍小兒，怙惡不悛，隱然有逐之之意。翌日，大令官廨以刺客聞，而吳遂不知所終。吳與故都督張勳，爲金蘭交，勳以軍旅扼淮上，鬻爵者螘附，或以干進之說動。吳乃恚曰：「富貴非吾願，勳雖與我爲手足交，然而彼顯達若是，我豈肯以貧賤而趨炎折腰耶？」比吳遷居鎮江，乃業銅匠，遂以吳銅匠稱焉；而人亦胥呼以吳銅匠，遂忘其名。吳欣然樂之，不辱於心也。勳過鎮，造其廬，欲委之以官職，而吳毅然却之曰：「我幼時卽不樂爲官，官者民僕，徒自苦耳。心懷其民，則太勞瘁，不懷其民，則心疚而不得安，曷若徜徉於市以肥遯哉」？吳粗諳翰墨，亦能作簡札，談吐豪健。其廬距吾家不數十武，顧余近始知其爲人，今尙仍以銅匠爲業，厥舊志也。</p>

<p>爲了一些兒小事，往內地去。雖然路程並不遠，但在那一道上，沒有火車，沒有汽車，雖有舟楫，但行駛是遲緩得出人意料之外的，所以雖然利用着唯一快速的交通工具，十八世紀式的獨輪車，還是不能當天到達。</p>
<p>二月裏的天氣，五點鍾左右，太陽已是躲到地平綫下面去了，遵從着旅途中唯一旅伴，小車夫的忠告，爲免在途遇到暴徒計，便投宿在車夫所介紹的一家客店裏。</p>
<p>這家客店，據車夫說，是在這路上來往的「仕宦行商」所投宿的惟一客店。但這客店，與其名爲客店，還不如乾脆地說是農家，來得妥切。沒有招牌，就在門口上黏着一條褪了色的紅紙條，上面寫着不易辨認的「利商客店」四個字。屋子是茅頂泥壁的一列三間。中間是客堂，除了破板桌，破長凳之外，還有一架織布機。上首是店主的臥室，下首的前部，是客店，後部是廚房。</p>

<p>八點鐘，我才躺上牀，老闆娘又送進一壺茶來，帶着笑說道，「客官睡得恁早，可是嫌寂寞麼？」我忙說「並不是，倒是坐了一天車，乏了。」接着，老闆娘和車夫，在外面說着，笑着。我眼睜睜的躺到十點鍾，咳了一聲嗽，老闆娘又進來了，問我怎麼。我裝着鼾，不理伊。十一點鐘後，外間火息了，我才放心闔眼。</p>
<p>下天，清早，給雞呌醒了過來，忽忽地洗了一把臉，算了賬，晨餐也沒進，催著車夫登程。當那車夫舉起車槓時，我還隱約聽見老闆娘，站在門口，長長地嘆了一口氣。</p>

<p>前天應友人之約去看「春之花」試片，一來熱水汀把院外的冷氣擋住；二來那駘蕩的歌聲，充滿了春氣。意忘却了「冬天的春天」了。</p>
<p>但是這種春氣，不能永在，給暴風雨襲擊了好幾回，到曲終人散的時候，蕭瑟凄怨，簡直成了秋天，尤其是「春之花」的歌聲，在前後不同的生活裏喝出來，顯然給我以深刻的感慨。等到走出院來，子夜的冷氣加緊的包圍攏來，看到院子裏一般人的黯淡的神色，使我幾乎哭出來。</p>
<p>所以我覺得青春的剎那，非用強力扒住不可，像金娘那般毫無意識，只愛虛榮，給東風吹到西面去，給西風吹到東面去，結果成了沾泥之絮，眞是耽誤了青春，浪費了青春。</p>

<p>德國梅倫博士發明之男用「補體康」，女用「補女容」二藥，係採取青春期之雌雄兩性動物睾丸，卵巢之荷爾蒙所製成。能促進內分泌機能之旺盛，使生殖力強化。而得到充分之發育，故男性之生殖矮小，遺精早洩，勃起力不堅，女子月經失常，白帶下等症，即能根本治愈。且能使肌肉豐腴，皮膚嬌嫩，失眠，眩暈等症，亦能於無形中消滅。故泰西各國男女兩界，莫不愛用此藥，以其有去病駐顏還童之力也</p>

<h3 id="c184">略談近年我國生物學的進步 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 光煜</p>
<p>布累特什奈得（Emil　Bret　chneider）氏說：「中國人觀察天然之才能不顯，探求眞理之熟心亦不著，其二者爲博物學家所必具、而國人士皆闕焉。交中國文體不甚正確，恒至模棱兩可，而中國人士又夙傾向眩奇，所抱見解極爲幼稚」。這是站在唯心論的立場上，把中國自古以來所以沒有生物學的原因，剖析得十分清楚的。近十餘年來，中國生物學研究卻迅速進步，在世界學術界中已經佔著相當的地位。那末，爲什麽現在我們觀察天然的才能和探求眞理的熱心就顯著起來了呢。這當然是社會關係不同的緣故。亨丁頓（Elsworth　Huntington）氏以爲中國農民常常遭遇災荒，生活難苦，所以性情多慳吝鄙陋。由此推想起來，我國古代因爲停滯在農業社會中，生產能力薄弱，得到豐滿的生活；就是那些號稱殷富的人，也多不鑑於求生不易，終日祇知爲名爲利著想，不會放開心懷去作科學的研究。所以非待資本主義社會逐漸在中國抬頭的今日，生物學是不會發達的。</p>
<p>書本上的生物學，輸入中國已經有數十年的歷史了。觀察實物，依據實騐來作生物學的研究，則不過十餘年的歷史，這可以溯源於民國十一年中國科學社的創辦生物研究所。自從那時候起，直到現在，還不過十五年工夫，但成績卻已建樹了不少。研究的機關除中國科學社的生物研究所以外，尚有民國十七年在北平成立的靜生生物研究所，同年在南京成立的國立中央研究院的自然歷史博物館（二十二年改稱動植物研究所），十八年在北平設立的北平研究院的動植物研究所和二十年在四川巴縣北碚成立的中國西部科學院的生物研究所等。各個著名的大學如中央·中山·北京·清華·武漢·山東·浙江·金陵·燕京·嶺南等，都設有生物系，作分科或分區的研究。學會除中國科學社外，尚有北平的自然歷史科學會，中國動物學會，中國植物學會和中國生理學會，青島的海洋生物學會及南通的昆蟲趣味會等。出版物有中國科學社生物研究所繫報，靜生生物研究所繫報，國立中山大學農林植物研究所繫刊及其他的各種雜誌和各種單行本。此種出版物多數用西文書寫，與世界各著名研究機關和學者交換的，就中國科學社生物研究所而論，已達五百餘處，其爲世人所注意，於此可見一斑。</p>
<p>但就一般的學校敎育和一般人的常識而論，以上各研究機關和各大學所有的研究成績，實在尚嫌過於偏重高深而忽略普及。因爲一般學校所用的敎科書和一般人所需要的讀物牠們都尚未能供給，尚須讓各書局來盡這個責任。所以近年中國生物學研究進步的狀況，就高深方面而論，當歸功於上述的各研究機關和各大學，就普及方面而論，各書局的功績，當亦不應一筆抹殺。</p>
<p>年來科學救國的呼聲已經甚　　上了。生物學在救國的直接用途上本來不多，但就間接的關係而說，　末農業·醫藥·水產·有機化學等都要以生物學的研究爲基礎。並且自從達爾文確立進化學說以后，七十年來，給與人類思想上的影響，實較其他任何學說爲大，所以在這非常時期中，普及物學知識於一般人，還是一種極重要的工作。</p>
<p>我國本來是沒有科學，沒有生物學的。在這生物學研究剛在興盛，初有成績的當兒，尤其應該把這些成績的精華，設法普及於一般人，使一般人能做高深研究的後盾。因此我們以爲現在各書局所應該出版的生物學書，除良好的敎科書外，還有兩方面是應該注意的。一方面是像最近「科學」雜誌所推薦過的「生物素描」那樣的「既能描敘科學事實，又帶文學意味」的作品，可使一般人把向為認科學書籍爲乾燥無味的觀念打破，在不知不覺中，接受科學的薰陶。這一類的書，除「生物素描」以外，還有開明書店出版的「花鳥虫魚」「動物珍話」「鳥與文學」「昆虫漫話」「昆虫的生活」等，都是值得推薦的好書。另一類是根據中國材料來寫成的大部頭的參考書，如辭典。圖譜及內容豐富的分類學書等。這一類的書竟還未曾有過，這是今後出版界所應十分努力的。</p>
<p>「附註」關於辭典坊間雖已有植物學大辭典動物學大辭典等書，因係完全依據日本材料，且出版年代已久，故一般學者深以不適實用爲病。圖譜一類有靜生生物研究所出版的中國植物圖譜，中國蕨類圖譜，河北習見樹木圖說，河北習見魚類圖說等，內容均甚精湛。但材料少，售價昂，故亦不適於是一般人應用。</p>

<p>— 周爲羣</p>
<p>「……處心積慮，深思苦索，終得一量豁然貫通，窺破了眞理的奧妙，感受著無窮的趣味。……」</p>
<p>記得在中學時期，先生只對我說三角形三角之和等於三直角，沒有聽說小於或大於是二直角，也許先生自己還不曉得。進了大學，才有一位先生在上課時偶然說到在非歐　男得幾何學上，三角形三角之和小於或大於二直角；可是他沒有　出其所以然。那時我聽了很覺奇怪，以爲三角形三角之和等於二直角，不但在理論上絕無異議，即在事實上也百試百騐，道　得成爲問題哪？若說小於或大於二直角，不　得依據何種理由，理由暫且不管，只看事實就明明不合。況且幾何學是何等精嚴的科學，幾何學上證明的定理，還是靠不住，天下可信的道理還能有多少呢？不過非歐幾里得幾何學既經公認，當然不會胡說亂道，我的好奇心不能自己，一定要把非歐里得幾何學來研究一番，看牠究具什麽本領，竟敢顚倒是非，發出這種驚人的怪論來。於是國內沒有，求之國外，一本，兩本，三本，四本，先後買了幾個學者著的非歐幾里得幾何學來看，無奈當初看來看去看不懂，表面上好像懂了，骨子裏還沒有懂；忍耐著，今天看不懂，明天再看，明天還看不懂，後天再接，接連幾天還看不懂，擱置起來，以後再看，這樣斷斷續續過很長的時期，處心積慮，深思苦索，終得一旦豁然貫通，窺破了眞理的奧妙，感受著無窮的趣味。研究普通幾何學的人，我以爲不可不懂得非歐幾里得幾何學，不懂得非歐幾里得幾何學，其淺見寡聞，固不待言，而且也就不曉得幾何學是什麽（What　is　Geometry？）徒然記得許多定理，定理是沒有多大價值的。我因爲所看到的許多非歐幾里得幾何學　　　　　　　，所以吃苦不少。在我看不懂的時候，就想等到自己徹底瞭解以後，必要編著一本使人容易看懂的非歐幾里得幾何學；現在我既得了門徑，故履行宿願，編者這本非歐幾里得內何學淺說。幾何學是演釋的科學，最基本最重要的在乎原理的闡明，把原理弄清楚了，以下就沒有多大困難了，所以這本小　　在闡明原理，我自學時所覺得得難懂，很難懂而又非澈底懂得不可的地方，不憚反　　解，只要學通普通幾何學而頭關比較精密的人，就可以看懂我這本書。高中畢業或高中三年級已學過解析幾何學的看這本書，尤其相宜。缺陷之過，知所難免，僅承讀者指正，無任感激。</p>

<p>— 蕭叔訥</p>
<p>郭沫若著　開明書店出版　定價四角五分</p>
<p>倘然我們要探討中國文學，要推數中國的文學革命，就該意識到一位偉大的革命詩人屈原！眞的，他以南方貴族身分竟是全部接受了民衆文藝的氣質創立和堅守著了自己的詩的體格，大膽將那雅頌之類的臺閣體貴族文學完全推翻了；在中國文學史上給留下最光榮的一頁。我們如其有著文學的愛好，不容我們不最先認識這位超絕的有著敏銳感受性的詩人，以及相當地了解他底作品。</p>
<p>可是問題卻從此發生了：這因爲屈原離開我們已經二千多年，所有實質上關於他的存在的物證都已消滅了，而史記屈原傳以前的文獻又是那樣貧乏；因了屈原傳在細節上的疏失和爲後人所　改訛　，出此有些人竟疑及屈原的存在，像　季平胡適之等都懷疑屈原也許沒有這個人。現在他們的疑問，在郭沫若先生所著「屈原」一書中可獲得明確的解答了。</p>
<p>這本書共分三章，第一章詳論屈原的存在及懷疑說的批判。第二章關於屈原作品年代及眞僞問題的剖析。第三章敘述屈原思想的傳承和他的藝　態度。本書著者不僅依憑著書本上的材料，更從金文，甲骨文裏面去找證據。例如他以金文中常見到子孫稱父祖的字號，由是推定離騷里「朕　考曰伯庸」是屈原稱謂他父親的號。這論據是何等地有力啊！於此，著者又繁複地昭示出關於屈原的家世，這不單使我們確信他的存在；而且很幸運的從郭氏的精密古代曆法的演算上，給我們明瞭這位偉大詩人的正確的生卒年月日！</p>
<p>舊來對於他的生辰見解不一，據劉師培「古歷管窺」依夏曆推算，其生辰當僞楚宣王二十七年（周顯王二十六年——西　前三四三）正月二十一日。若據陳　「　子生卒年月者」！書所言，照周　推算，則僞同年三月二十二日。然而郭氏卻以「他的生年月日見於離騷「　提貞於孟嚴兮惟庚賓吾以降」，他是生於太歲在賓的那年正月的庚寅。據「呂氏春來」序意篇言：「維　八年歲在　　」，知道西紀前二三九年是申年，推數上去前三四一年的楚宣王二十九年（周顯王二十八年）該是寅年，但那年的正月小，庚申朔，沒有庚寅的一天。……歲星是每八二·六年超辰一次的，在那期間中超了一次辰，寅年便當是前三四〇年，那年的正月小，甲申朔，庚寅是初七，與離騷相合」。我相信誰也不會有什麽疑問了，在看了他這等精到的推演之後。</p>
<p>郭氏的發明還不止此，他從金文提示出楚辭煞尾處的「亂曰」即「辭曰」。又從甲骨文字辯白「天問篇」並不是後人難湊之作——如胡適之先生所說，而是屈原自己的作品。他所提出鐵一般的證據，使我們親切地感著對於偉大的詩人的愛悅。</p>
<p>郭氏此書該當是一部少見的專門著作。最近據他說這原是作僞開明中學生叢書而寫出的，只是太艱深了些，便加上附錄「離騷今言譯」讓牠獨立起來（見二月號文學里屈原時代）。這里，我們尤不可輕易放過這附錄的譯文；相信凡有舊文學修養的人，誰都明白要把古詩　譯成現代詩確是一項艱鉅工作，蓋因其文字隱晦，常是很難於一貫的把牠們表達出來，例如離騷云「解佩纓以結言兮，吾令蹇修以爲理」。王逸章句說是「理分理也，述　意也」。仍不能指出牠的明確概念。這樣述當然就困難了：但郭氏根據下文「理弱而蝶拙」和九章抽思「理弱而媒不通」，又思美人「令　荔以爲理！囡芙蓉而爲媒」的「理」與「媒」對　，證明提婚人謂之理，「蓋古者提婚人與媒介人有別」。於是便很明快的譯成下詩句：「我把蘭佩解下來拜託了蹇修，我請他　了去爲我向她求愛」。正足表徵譯者是頗費了甚深的研素的。不過我以爲此外仍得有補釋一下的必要，否則一般將無法了解蘭佩與求愛有著怎麼　關聯。今考大戴禮「蔫氏之機，　氏之　，注「蘭柱香草名」。本草云「　香，即杜　也」。唐詩：「情人一去無窮已，欲贈　香恨不逢」。故「解佩纓以結言」乃是男女相悅以香物投贈之謂！佩纓依我的愚見，即是　幃，王逸曰「幃謂之　，贈香囊也」。香囊亦即　　，古時男女均佩之、爾今天之香纓」。是以婚嫁名曰結藕，詩　風「親以自思」，香纓與容　亦屬一物，禮內則注云「容　，香物也。助以形容之飾，以纓繫之」。洪興　楚辭補注「古者男女均佩容　，　，香物也」。此種佩香　與性愛有關，晉繁欽定情詩「何以致叩叩？香囊　肘後」。古時孔雀東南飛所指則更明顯，說是「紅羅複斗帳，四角垂香囊」。據清李調元「粵東筆記」卷四，說南越之民，凡男女將有所私，便以香囊質於神前，往往得其所欲。夠了，說來話長！但，即此可見郭氏的譯述，對於原文是有著充分的理解。</p>
<p>另外郭氏對於離騷里面「也還有一個疑問便是那「名余曰正則兮，字余曰靈均」的兩句，要說是屈原自述其名號，何以他不說名平字原」？其實呢：離騷是他晚年被放逐後的真　之作。——楚人是受了殷人宗敎信念的　　，觀其原作品中常有靈巫的活　　可知道。這　他充滿了一腔牢騷，使他更迫切需要超現實性的解脫，離騷不是說嗎？「願依彭咸之遣則」，衆「山海經」海內西紅及　荒西經有「巫彭」「巫咸」之名，王逸云「彭咸　寶大夫，諫其君不聽，自投水而死」。又云「巫咸古神巫也，當殷中　之世」。那末屈原是要打算云爲巫了。離騷自稱「正則」是從「彭咸之遣則」得名，字以「　均」蓋取衆巫之義。和　　　氛正同是巫名。若我的臆想不誤。頗熟　郭氏於本書重版時加以補正。</p>
<p>我僅以十分的敬意，介紹這本書給青年巫閱讀。深信會因此引起對於這偉大詩人及其作品的研究興趣的。</p>
<h3 id="c187">科學文學化 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 王梅葉</p>
<p>——介紹「氣象學講話」——</p>
<p>普通人大都愛讀文學書而不愛讀科學書，這理由，爲的是研究科學要用精密的頭腦云苦心思考，因此就感到科學的乏味，見了科學的科目要感到頭痛。其實我巫要知道，無論你研究何種學問，「苦心思考」是免不掉的，你怕苦心思考，你就沒有學成的希望；就以文學而論，假使你閱讀的時候，不去苦心思考，會忽略了美妙的描寫，曲折的意義的。現在所以覺得讀文學書不費力而讀科學書費力的緣故，無非是文字之趣味而已。</p>
<p>科學是改進人類生活的樞紐，近世是科學的世界，假使某一國家的科學不發達，這一個國家就有被人吞滅的危險。所以，我巫生在今日。雖然不想做大科學家，然而日常生活上的普通的科學常識是不能不知道一些的。</p>
<p>因爲科學書的文字大多枯燥乏味，大家不愛閱讀　弄得日常生活上的普通的科學常識也不具有，生在科學世界的今日，前途的危險，眞是不堪言　！據一位醫生告訴我，說是有許多藥品，味苦難服，所以特地和入香甜的菓汁，使人口不感困難。我相信，科學的書籍，即是枯燥無味，終得用趣味的文字來寫述，像苦的藥中加入香甜的菓汁一樣才對。我羡慕外國兒童的福氣，得讀用文學的筆調來寫述科學著作，像法布爾的「化學奇談」「科學的故事」（此兩書開明書店均有譯本）「我巫的地球」「昆蟲記」等。使人讀的時候像是在讀小說，而科學的知識，在不知不覺中已鑚進讀者的腦海了。</p>
<p>這種富有趣味的科學著作，在中國除了幾體譯本外，可說不多見了。但譯本無論你譯得怎麼好，究竟是外國的舶來品，外國的國情並不同我們一樣，外國的材料對我無中國人多少有些隔膜，可以我無中國人，最好也用他們的方法來自己製造些國貨。這一冊「氣象學講話」，便是咱們的精美的國貨。文筆的美妙，可以對法布爾無　！</p>
<p>這一本書共分九講，將風，雲，雨，露，霜，雪，冷，熱等的氣象，借一位米老先生對著兩位叫子俊，子傑的侄兒講述故事而表現了出來，使我們讀後，獲得一種氣象的知識。本來關於氣象的著作，中國出版的很少，而且氣象學這一種學問，學習時像習數學一樣的氣悶。一因出版的書籍不多，一因材料乏味，所以國人對於之像是朽銅爛鐵一樣的不加注意。試執一個讀了十多年書的學者而問一聲「雲有幾種」？我相信他的回答是「兩種，白雲黑雲」，並且他還得笑你發問得愚蠢，以爲這是四五歲的小孩都知道的常識。可是，他的回答算得對嗎？我們翻翻氣象學的書，知道雲有十三種，形態高度都不同，而且我們知道雲是善於變化的——眞變化並非我們望上去像一支狗，停一回兒變得像一個人的變化——每一種雲，變厚變薄，或會變得不見，或會變成別種名稱的雲。大詩人的詩，常以風，雲，雨，露，霜，雪等等做詩料，所以就是研究文學的人，讀了一回本書，再回味那大詩人的吟咏，可以得到一種分外的趣味。</p>
<p>這本書，僅用故事的體裁來講述氣象學的道理，而且還有不少可以給人實騐的地方，可以給人參考的圖畫，使讀者閱讀，可以格外的容易瞭解。</p>
<p>大家說，讀科學書是沉悶而乏味的，但著書的人，能夠像醫生樣在苦藥中　入香甜的東西，自然可以把「沉悶乏味」消去。現在我發現了這樣一本好書，敬爲讀者介紹。同時，我很希望一般著作家，能夠注意到這一點，使科學文學化，使大家向來不愛讀科學書的念頭改變過來，使沉寂的科學界熱鬧起來，這眞是讀書界的一種幸福，說大一些是人類的幸福！目光遠大而很有生氣的開明書店，願你繼此書之後繼續努力，我想我這一個小小的希望，終能實現吧！</p>

<p>開明書店出版　定價一元四角</p>
<p>翻開近年來的報紙，我們常常可以看見，在招生欄中有許多晨夜補習學樣的廣告。試把這些廣告分析起來，幾乎有一半是屬於日文專修科的。從這裏我們可以想見，我國青年於業餘課餘之暇，正在怎樣的注意到「知己知彼」的工作。但是我們試向各出版家去搜求一些適用的日語讀本來看，據我氫知，用於初學的，能夠把課文，文法，練習等融和在一塊，加以詳細解說的書，似乎很少，一般讀本，往往顧此失彼。至於用於高級的和自修的，更是少得可憐。所以有許多學校往往採用口授方式或竟直接採用日本本子。這結果，當然難免錯誤遺漏和格不相入的地方。</p>
<p>在這很少的幾本關於學習日語的好書里邊，我想介紹一本更能使人滿意，適於敎學自修的書籍：——艾華著的「日本語法例解」。</p>
<p>著者在這本書的「卷頭語」中說：「著者著述本書的重要意思有兩個：一，便讀者澈底了解日語的意義。二，使讀者容易理會　譯的方法。」我不願爲了他說了這兩句話，就稱讃他「能夠打破學者　來所感到的困難」。因爲有許多書僅管在序文中大吹大擂，其內容卻完全使人失望。我們且老老實實的翻開書來，細細的看一下：</p>
<p>書中以日本晨俗小波翻譯的伊索寓言爲課文，即簡短又有趣。這些故事多是讀者已經知道了的，讀起來更可增中理解的能力。但這並不算是它的特點。它惟一的好處，是能夠利用每一句的註解，舉了許多語例，甚至列成表格，精細的說明句中各詞的文法，使讀者無意中學習了去，正像咬一口饅頭，又吃了裏面的餡一般。課文中除了最易了解的字句外，幾乎逐一翻譯了出來，加以詳細的解說，使初學的人看了也可以十分領悟。每課之後，並且附有讀者應該暗記的熟語及慣用語，以便特別熟讀。從這裏，我們可以想見著者是在怎樣苦心的替讀者打算了。</p>
<p>此外書中各句的譯法也多有獨到的地方。可惜爲了篇幅和排印不便的關係，不能舉出幾個例子來。全書共三十課，計三百五十四頁。如能用心研讀，最多三個月，即可讀完。</p>
<p>末了，我希望艾華先生或別的對於日文深有研究的學者，多出些這一類的書。使一般初習日文的人，不至感到讀物的缺乏。</p>

<h3 id="c191">袪除誤會乃在質疑 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>吾人與世相處，不能無誤會，與願相違，不能無憤慨。茍經質疑，然後眞相大明，誤會乃解。否則加以臆斷，疑慮在心，任意譏評，或予訕笑，引起彼此誤會。在受者方面，猶不知何爲致此？無從究其根原，豈非惋惜之事乎？他者勿論，請以電信言之：</p>
<p>電信爲公用事業之一，與用者——收發報人或電話用戶——有切身利害關係者也。茍電話不靈，或電報不通或延誤，則用者當然抱不滿意。然不通不靈之原因，是否由於電局疏忽之故，非經質疑或調查，不能明其責任所在。如查明確係電局錯誤，則電局即憑電報或電話營業通則及各項電信法令辦理，同時應向用者退還多費，並表歉意。如錯誤不在電局，則電局方面，不負法律上道德上之責任也。</p>
<p>用者如有意見，不向電局詢問，或加以調查，而將所遇之事，與所受之苦向外界揚言曰：「電報不通也」，「電話不靈也」。由識者觀之，則此人此言，頗缺乏理智，不明章程，非電局所願也。</p>
<p>閱南京某報，載有「電話打不通」新聞一則，發報人某君，因於某夜十一時往下關電局發報，敲門不應，電報未得發出，即投函某報，述其遭遇。後經業務稽查調查，該局夜不閉戶，發報人無須推敲，且工作人員晝夜不離，更無敲門不應之理。且查是夜是時，尚有數商家發報，有報底之可證，可見某君誤敲他門，不得其門而入，致電報未能發出，吾人深表同情，乃不予調查，即斷爲「電報打不通」，引起誤會，未免可惜耳。</p>
<p>在電局方面，亟願社會人士將所收發報話實況見告，故有業務稽查之設置，有通信稽查片之舉辦。尤願社會人士明瞭收發報話章程，故有本刊之發行，定期廣播之講述，及各項規章之寄贈。如承各界送局或用電話詢問各項章規或手續，無不竭誠歡迎。祛除一切誤會，解釋一切疑團，然後能達到嚴密合作之目的也。</p>
<h3 id="c192">華文電報收報人住址名稱書寫及計費辦法之補充 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 葆眞</p>
<p>關於華文電報收報人住址名稱之書寫及計費辦法，現行國內電報營業通則內已有詳細規定。惟由某收報人收轉某人之華文私務電報，例如「上海麥特赫司脫路（五三八）弄五號張伯虞轉曾仲公」，其「轉」字以下各字，究應列入收報人住址名稱或電文內計算字數，則尚無明文規定，以致電局收發員對於發報人交發之上項電報，往往仍按向例將轉交或轉送某人等字，均列入電文內計費。茲聞交通部爲便利發報人起見，特予通令各電報局規定補充辦法如下：</p>
<p>（一）凡由某收報人收轉某人之華文私務電報，無論其收報人住址名稱係用文字詳細書寫，或用電話號碼或郵箱號數代替住址者，其第二收報人名，應准連同「轉」字或「轉交」二字，一併列入收報人住址名稱之內。例如（一）「上海麥特赫司脫路（二八八）號張仲箎轉王叔梅——盼速回平」，（二）「南京話（三一七八八）陳志仁轉葉爾衡——欵匯否電復」，（三）「青島郵箱（二七五）號黃永孚轉交戴石泉——清密…………」。上述第一例之收報人住址名稱共計十五字，按照國內電報營業通則第八十三條說明第三項之規定，計超出二字，故應作五字計費（收報地名作二字計費）。第二例之收報人住址名稱並未超過十三字，照章可作三字計費。至第三例係華文密語私務電報所有收報人住址名稱各字照章應按四字收費。</p>
<p>（二）凡由某掛號戶收轉某人之華文私務電報，其性質與由某收報人　轉者相同，應准按照前項規定辦法同樣辦理。國內電報營業通則第四十五條規定之書寫格式並應補充爲：</p>
<p>掛號字樣　收報地名　收轉某人　電文</p>
<p>○○二二　北平　轉王維誠　……</p>
<p>所有掛號字及「轉」字以下各字，在華文明語私務電報內，共計不逾十三字者，或在華文密語私務電報內共計不逾十四字者，應准分別作爲三字或四字計費。</p>
<p>凡有二個或二個以上收報人名稱之華文電報，除經發報人注明「分送幾份」字樣納費標識者，除應按分送電報辦法辦理外：其未經發報人注明該項標幟者，電局收發員，往往仍按向例祗將第一收報人名稱列入住址內，並將第二收報人名稱列作電文按字計費。例如「南京大行宮中央飯店康鳴綱——陳國華隨連同來，該電未免與原意不符。聞交通部亦已令飭各電報局准將該項電報內所含二個或二個以上收報人名稱，一併列入收報人住址名稱內照章計費。但以屬於同一住址者爲限。」</p>
<p>上項補充辦法實行以後，各界稱便，對於來　電報，尤爲適用，例如「上海大華飯店鄒國良先生踐佩華女士——敬賀新婚快樂並祝幸福無量詠梅」一電內之兩個收報人名稱一併列入住之內，絕無割裂之弊。至該電之收報人住址名稱共計十四字，照章應作四字計費。再該電既未經發報人注明「分送二份」，故收報局投遞時祗須抄送第一收報人一份，如第一收報人不在，則將該電送交第二收報人。其有二個以上收報人者，以此類推。</p>
<h3 id="c193">談談發報人時常忽略的事 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 章立</p>
<p>電信特刊自發行以來，對於外界確有不少供獻，今日電信事業日漸與民衆接近，不能不歸功於是。惟民衆方面能明瞭電信業務，而儘量利用電報者固多，尚不知發電辦法者，仍屬不少。不佞願將平日收發電報人士極普遍忽略之處，借本刊一角，爲讀者告。</p>
<p>一華文明語自譯者須加注文字：</p>
<p>按國內電報營業通則第四十二條：「華文明語私務電報，不得僅書電碼而無文字」，之規定，各處收電員，對於是項無文字之電報，必須請發報人加書文字，自係按章辦理。往往因傭人傳語不清，或發報人一向拍發官軍電報，已成習慣，今偶發尋常電報，亦不書文字，雖經多番解釋，仍易引起不快或誤會情事。不佞特再提出，請發報人注意。交通部所以要訂此項規定，無非替發報人謀利益。因爲發報人如不加注文字，設有誤釋字碼之處，無從校正。若已加注，收電員可隨時校對更正，不致使收報人接到電報，閱讀不通。直接有助於收發報人，間接可有補於電局信譽，而達到電報爲人民服務之最大目的。</p>
<p>二電底必須書明發報人姓名住址</p>
<p>發報人之姓名住址，必須詳書於電報紙上，倘遇電報不能送妥時，即可依照所寫地址，通知發報人。否則電報不能投遞，發報人無從通知，所以詳注發報人姓名住址，實於發報人有莫大便利。</p>
<p>時有一般商行拍發電報，僅書一行名或店號，每不加蓋圖章。電局方面爲發報人便利起見，亦多通融辦理，即行照收。然在商行方面着想，此點實有危險！設有不肖分子，假冒該商行名義，發電作惡欺詐，一旦發生不幸事件，所受重大損害，電局自不負責。所以希望各大商行加以注意，以後拍發必須加蓋印章，最好具有暗號，通知當局查照，以資鄭重。　（未完）</p>

<p>自交通部國際電台直達全世界各處電路先後開放，凡經由Cgra傳遞之國際電報，莫不迅捷非常，抑且準確無訛，夙荷各界加以贊許。唯考查電報紙快慢，皆依發出原來時刻爲標準，因之『時刻』一項在電報上頗稱重要。爰查中國與世界各處之時刻，因地理之關係，與世界各重要都市，快慢相差有數十分鐘者，有十數小時者，差數不一。茍非常用國際電報之行家，恐難明瞭詳切也。今爲求便利稽考國際來報傳遞之時間普遍起見，特就中國與世界各處時刻差數分別列表於左：</p>
<p>說明</p>
<p>稽核國際來報傳遞時刻時，可依上表凡較中國時刻快者，將原發報時刻减去較快時刻，慢者加上較慢時刻，即可算得，如日本東京來報發報時刻9.15收到時刻10.15則傳遞時間，可知爲兩小時。即10.15-（9.15-1.00）=2.00，21.00-(10.00+8.00)=3.00餘類推。</p>

<p>本刊特爲問答一欄，社會人士，對於電報電話收發手續及對於電信章程不明瞭之處，或對於電信常識有所垂詢時，本刊表示歡迎，具情奉答</p>
<p>一，天津胡開明君問　敝處前接各方發來明語官電甚多，均由本人自譯頗覺麻煩。進來所接之電報，由電局代譯送來，殊爲方便。然間有未經譯注者，不知電局辦事章程如何？請示知</p>
<p>（答）交通部爲示服務週到起見，特通飭各局自三月一日起，除密碼外所有政務明碼來報，均應由收報局代譯投送。嗣後台端接到明語官譯，及加急，尋常電，或交際電，如未代譯者，請向電局交涉可也</p>
<p>二，吳縣劉子和問　友人曾於一月十四日向電話局裝用電話一具，旋於二月十八日撤去，電局要收二個月之租費，是否合法？</p>
<p>（答）依照交通部市內電話營業通則第三十六條「用戶裝機在月之十五日或十五日以前，撤機在十六日或十六日以後者，其租費概按全月計算」之規定，話局收兩個月之租費，尚無不合。</p>
<p>三，鄭縣華文秀君問　長途電話傳呼通知，業已經傳，而逾規定期間，尚未到局答話，發話人要求退號，應如何辦理？</p>
<p>（答）此應免徵銷號費，并專力費應一律退還。</p>

<h3 id="c196">德軍開進萊茵後的局勢 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 能</p>
<p>德軍前日突然開進萊菌不駐兵地帶後，各國大爲震驚，允其是法國，糲兵秣馬，調兵遺將，德軍陸續開至者，截至現在爲止，大的已有六萬人之多，大戰形勢，擺在眼前，某國新聞家預言，謂歐洲大戰開始，將在明年夏間，人將竊笑觀察之謬誤。</p>
<p>據法政府表示，謂如有一德兵駐紥萊茵地帶，便說不上談判，據德政府表示，如要德軍退出一兵一卒，是絕不可能，幷且兩國的距離，僅有一河之隔，不必大砲非，便是手槍，也可接觸，形勢至這樣地步，假定再說沒有大戰的可能，眞是非愚則狂。</p>
<p>其實大戰的開始與不開始，全在第三者英國，而不在法國，法國認爲這次德國撕毁洛迦諾公約的，是一件了不得的事，幷且恐怕德國第一步駐兵萊茵，第二就要收回大戰時的失地，此决若不迎頭痛擊，後患將不可勝言，故法國認爲這次事件的嚴重性，卽在這裹。</p>
<p>但是英國的態度怎樣？英决不願有第二决大戰發生，其故有二：（一）意阿戰爭，英雖表示十分不滿，但是到底非但不敢用武力來裁制，卽經濟裁制，亦未完全辦到，現在且有英意妥恰的可能，幷且遠東方面，自日本東京暴變以後，侵略手段，更是顯露，若再加以德法戰爭，勢必造成世界混戰的局面，這都是擺在眼前的事實。</p>
<p>（二）就這决德軍突然開進萊茵的事件來考察，萊茵地帶，原爲德國的土地，德國的土地，駐紮德國軍隊，原是天公地道的事，並不能說德國過分的舉動，假定甲國的軍隊駐紮乙國的士地，或是乙國的軍隊駐紮丙國的土地，這才算是不對，故據前日巴黎電，謂「英國以爲德國重新駐兵萊茵河區，並不能作爲施行對德制裁的根據，因德國之行動，並非侵略性質。」這尙屬公平的論調，然而法人聞之，必定大為不滿。</p>
<p>法國認爲這次德國破壞洛迦諸公約，事態的嚴重性，無有過於此者，其實回過頭來一看，現在所謂公約，所謂盟的，不知已經撕毁了多少，幷且他們的毁約，完全是侵略性質，故此决德軍重駐萊茵，在法人視之，認爲事態嚴重，但在他國視之，則屬並不希罕也。</p>
<p>現在歐洲應付德國毁的之舉，將移倫敦談商，卽可見其事態之緩和矣。因為法人現在張脈憤興，非常激烈，在這種慷慨激昂的環境之下，不容易持平商談，故為調虎離山之計，此亦足見英國的苦衷，故歐洲大戰，現在尙未至成熟時期，便可於此看出。</p>

<p>石人頭的許多人家整整地忙碌了幾天夜，　黃伯壽是進城去辦洋紗，紅燭，和一切應用的雜物。張阿毛是指揮紮燈架，和支配扮的人。吳小三是向各大戶去借扮頭馬用的首飾服裝，和地戲里的行頭。全村里是鬧鬧熱熱地彷彿有什麽大不了的事情一般：在平時冷落得鬼也捉得出的黃家祠堂，這幾天里差不多日夜都擠滿了人。劈篾的劈篾，紮架子的紮架子，糊洋紗的糊洋紗，畫花的畫花，大全全在分工合作地工作着，每一個人的心里都滿貯着一種興奮的酵素。</p>
<p>「阿三你扮點什麽？」金生在出燈前的兩天向三和這樣問：「你總預備好了吧！」</p>
<p>「沒有！」三和笑着搖了搖頭說。</p>
<p>「你扮個怕老婆吧，三和，本來你滿會說死話的。」根寳接了上來向三和貢獻意見。</p>
<p>「不，我想扮捉蚌的，要請你家主婆來扮蚌壳精，你看怎麽樣？」三和俏皮地向根寳這樣反問。</p>
<p>「那麽還是請你自已的玉皇大帝來吧！」</p>
<p>「不行，她太老了，做蚌壳精的應該是年輕貌美的才對。」</p>
<p>「得，這樣吧，你扮一個捕蟹的，那麽呌你老婆來做一隻老蟹，這又新鮮又便當不是很好嗎？」</p>
<p>許多人蚤給他們說得笑了起來，便是根寳自已也勝利地笑了，然而三和却沒趣的將根士那頂新毡帽從頭上扯了下來摔到了門口。</p>
<p>出燈那天晚上，村子里已充滿了一片歡躍的生氣，許多孩子全一吃過晚飯就偷偸地從後門里溜了出去，遠處的鑼鼓聲和鞭爆聲也隱的地送進了每一個村人的耳朵里，村里的幾條狗是儘瘋狂般地嗥呌着，奔跑着；山前那個猛將堂里設着一個接馬燈的筵塲，在面前那片不十分廣闊的曠塲上已擁着一大堆的男女老少——</p>
<p>天空是漆黑的，沒有星子沒有月亮，可是在兩邊的山坡上却擠滿了許多看，馬燈的人，從鷄龍山脚下起，一直至黃葉嶺爲止，幾乎找不出一塊空隙的地方。</p>
<p>馬燈的行例出了黃家祠堂，從砂石路，梅花橋，蜿蜓地向黃葉嶺那里走去；燈火在這黑夜里閃耀着，彷彿似一條數里長的金蛇。那　鼓和鞭爆的聲音也已驚破了這深夜的沉寂，使得那些棲宿在樹林間的小鳥都嚇得在這黑暗中亂飛。</p>

<p>— 李軒</p>
<p>孩子的時候，每當三月問，桃花開得像一片粉紅色的海，雪都化進在洋綠波的麥田里，故鄉的村路上便熱鬧起來。</p>
<p>北村口搭起大的蓆棚，里面排着幾張長條桌子椅子，桌上有大得可笑的灰瓦壺，一個善心的老人不斷從鍋里灌進微溫的茶去，他除了燒茶點香，便鎭日蹲在軟濕的車道旁，待過路人走近棚前，老人立起身，裂開凹陷的嘴巴笑着說：</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>『辛苦呵，喝口茶再趕路吧』。</p>
<p>走路的人站穩時，向老人拱拱手，便把背上的黃色包袱解下來，捧到棚里面一隻供著神像的正方桌上，恭敬的豎立在龕里，將桌上的綫香捻起三棵，打那黑煙環繞的豆油燈上燃著，望神像作一下揖，把香插進香爐口，回轉身從條桌頭拿著黑瓦碗，湊近那像懷了孕的龐大茶壺的嘴子，倒出一碗濃紅的翻滾著好多烏末子的茶來。舉到唇邊就咕噔咕噔的嚥下喉嚨去。</p>
<p>這茶棚是專為『朝頂進香』的香客們預備的，行路人喝足了茶，在那長凳上呆夠了。就仍背起杏黃色的包袱，向老人拱手道聲：</p>
<p>『回來見哪，捎什么山貨不？』</p>
<p>『不，不，爬盤道的時候走慢點』。</p>
<p>這善心的老人永是不嫌煩瑣的送走每一個香客，香客們也川流不息的打三月初便斷斷續續從這路上走。</p>
<p>像這樣獨身趕山路的人，　作燒跑香的，他們都很窮苦，大半是左之八九十里路虔誠敬神的老夫婦，和喜歡賭博的中年光棍，與愛熱鬧的少年無賴鬼。有錢的人，奪了二輪大車去，帶著女人孩子，車里裝了熟的豬肉麥餅，白乾酒和紙牌之類的東西，趕車的伙子搖著手里的長皮鞭，驅著牲口走，一家人坐在車廂里，抹一陣紙牌，喝幾口濃烈的老酒，少年漢子高興時，偷看看前車後車打扮得入時的女人，上了年紀的差不多愛歪倒睏一覺，或到帝的車上賭陣陣牌九去，女孩子比較都老實些，偶而斜看男人兩眼，給母親　見時，就少不了挨兩句罵，女孩子漲紅著臉，好久不敢再抬起頭來。……這樣，像一幅廣大的流民圖似的走過兩天一夜的時光，便靠近山腳了。</p>
<p>另外，有一種還願的香客，他們都為了自己的親人意外的災難或病苦，向那位北龜山頂上的聖宮娘娘，許下了一項作踐自己慘酷的折磨：較好的是自己扮成一個奇形怪狀的獸類，如人身牛頭或豬頭的怪物，或什么惡鬼，他們從裝扮妥便離開家，一直跑到山上燒過香，才卸裝變回人的樣子。</p>
<p>最可憐的一些老婦人，為了求神保佑她的兒子或丈夫，便領著年輕的女兒每走一步就跪下叩一個頭，那麼趕到山上去燒香。兩天多黃塵捲了大小沙石的山路，老年人與孩子都支持不下來。途中，便很自然的時常昏過去，在任何村口或河渡頭的捨茶棚休息一天，精神恢復了，就又一步一跪的叩著頭行路。還有為自己的疾病死難等事許的，當他去還願時，非常古怪的扮成一個四隻腳的牲口，爬著跟一些香客們行路，身上披著馬鞍子臉上罩了籠頭，與一區駕轅的馬完全一樣，不過鞍上拴著一座小的香爐，爐里燃著香，幾百里的路程也要爬了去，爐里的煙永遠是不息的噴著，夜間把香爐拿下來，背著鞍子睡覺，直到朝過頂爬下山來為止。</p>
<p>有錢的家主可以給娘娘掛袍，貼金，送匾，不會幹那自作牛馬的孽障事。</p>
<p>三月末尾，香客們都帶著胡桃·黑棗·杮餅一些山間的野菓走向回家的路，碰巧那幾天來一場春雨，他們淋得像水雞似的，依然高興的在雨中行行著，互相告訴：</p>
<p>『澱山了，今年鬼見愁那兒滾下去了一個。』</p>
<p>『山坡上那些血呀！』</p>
<p>『閻王鼻子那兒娘兒倆一塊滾了山澗呢。』</p>
<p>他們的意思是滾了山坡的不修好不敬神的報應，我知道在那三個人擠不開的崎嶇山路上，偶然一步不踏穩，便有跌下去的機會，多少千人擁擠毒害向上爬，螞蟻似的蠕動著，當一個人從山坡上摔下來，人們便狂喊著：</p>
<p>『造孽的，造孽的！』</p>

<p>華美（一〇六〇）下午一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇『赤壁賦』</p>
<p>風流學士謫黃州。每日江頭盡興遊。壬戍新秋既望日。與二三知己話相投。瀟灑同登赤壁舟。少焉月出東山上·倚檻徘徊望斗牛。扣弦作板歌明月。滿滿頻將太白浮。一曲清歌一酌酒。客和蕭聲音韻幽。客是西川楊道士。吹得音裊裊、和得韻悠悠。恍如　婦孤舟。堪歡當年曹孟德。賦詩橫槊興優游。下江陵。破荊州。軸轤千里順風流。果然一世之雄也。未識而今安在否。三萬六千容易過。人生何幸寄蜉蝣。然須看破虛名利。話到窮通我亦羞。洗杯酌。肴核收。狼藉盃盤不自由。相與枕席在扁舟。</p>
<p>蔡筱舫果報錄</p>
<p>中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇『思春』</p>
<p>陌頭楊柳忽青青。獨倚闌干黯愴神。愁鎖雙眉心欲醉。悔教夫婿事長征。但見那，清園紅紫花如錦。蝶怨蜂狂儲好春。觸目芳菲多怨恨。寄情聊以撫瑤琴。但見那，焚香便把冰弦按。一曲彈完感動心。心切切。意愔愔。屈指歸期盼煞人。夕卜燈花朝占鵲。愁腸九轉又擔驚。不知他，他鄉可有柔鄉　。不顧精粹去別締婚。倘若是，留戀花叢甘薄倖。無端戲舊雙憐新。要問他，歸來何以慰嬌嗔。我是，近來綫針都拋卻。倦倚銀床病上身、恨只恨，萬種相思拋不了。怨只怨，夢魂顛倒更傷神。幸有那，隣家姐妹來可勸。且綠弓鞋去踏青。記得花朝明日是。好花枝與　金鈴。啼鳥枝頭又幸好音。</p>

<h3 id="e17">The Hirota Cabinet's Diplomatic Policy Towards the United States <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Hirota Koki, as a diplomat, was ordered to form a cabinet to cope with the extraordinary situation after the February 26th Incident. General observations indicate that this is a clear sign that Japan's future national policy will not be radicalized. However, the policies expressed by Hirota in recent days are all based on the original intentions of the young military officers. In terms of diplomacy, it will adopt an active policy towards China and Russia, and towards Europe and the United States, it will take coordination as the surface and practical interests as the bone. The so-called Hirota's Three Principles for China want to make China a vassal of Japan. The so-called withdrawal of the Soviet Far East Army is tantamount to demanding that the land east of Lake Baikal be incorporated into the Japanese Empire. Furthermore, in order to seek to independently use troops against Russia without any worries, Japan intends to have the United States automatically withdraw from the Far East. According to Hirota's latest statement, what Japan requires from the United States is the redistribution of economic resources, the opening of markets and free trade, and the lifting of immigration restrictions. In addition, Japan is more willing to conclude mutually beneficial economic agreements and politically mutual security treaties with the United States.</p>
<p>Can Hirota develop his diplomatic aspirations? Can the United States accommodate such demands? Will Japan-US relations be improved by this, so that Japan can concentrate its efforts on dealing with China and Soviet Russia? Regarding the so-called redistribution of world resources, Japan once proposed it at the London Naval Conference. Mr. Amau, the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has repeatedly cited the words of Colonel House of the United States and former British Foreign Secretary Hoare as the basis for this requirement (they believed that countries that are strong but not rich can discuss with those that are both rich and strong, such as Britain and the United States, the method of sharing world resources). However, although the United States is rich in natural resources, nineteen of them are in the United States mainland. Outside the mainland, such as Alaska, Hawaii, the Philippines, and Central America, are all places coveted by Japan. Can the United States allow Japan to interfere in these areas and seize the natural resources on which American industry depends? The so-called opening of markets and free trade are aimed at the tariff barriers of the United States and the anti-Japanese policies of various countries in Central and South America. However, even under such restrictions, Japan's commercial aggression against the Americas has achieved great success. According to the report released by the Tariff Commission in Washington on the 10th of this month, Japan's exports last year have exceeded the height of 1929, which is unmatched by any country in the world, and the largest part of the increase in exports is in the Central and South American markets.</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese goods have not only invaded Central and South America, which have always been the forbidden territory of American business circles, but also invaded the markets of the United States mainland. This development has caused great panic in the American industry. Under the current situation, Hirota wants the United States to open up its markets for Japan to allow the free flow of Japanese goods, which may not be accepted by the United States. As for the immigration issue, since the United States abolished the Gentlemen's Agreement in 1924, the bad relationship between Japan and the United States has centered on this issue. The Japanese population increases by one million every year. If Japan requires the United States to unconditionally accept Japanese immigrants, the United States will never accept it before the country is destroyed. If Japan only requires that Japanese immigrants to the United States receive the same treatment as immigrants from other countries, then according to the current US immigration law, Japan can only immigrate one or two hundred people to the New World each year. A drop in the bucket, what can it do to solve the accident? The American people have extremely suspicious and fearful psychology regarding the freedom of immigration for Japanese people, and under this kind of psychology, it is also impossible to abolish the anti-Japanese laws in the United States.</p>
<p>The economic development of Japan and the United States has reached a point of mutual conflict. In the past, Japan transported raw silk to the United States and the United States swiftly traded cotton to Japan, without interfering with each other. Today, Japan's exports are mainly industrial products, such as cotton cloth, electrical materials, and rayon, which are in a situation where they cannot coexist with American export goods. In the direction of China and South America, there is fierce competition. Therefore, it is difficult to establish an economic agreement that is beneficial to both parties. Moreover, since Japan announced the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty and withdrew from the London Naval Conference, the collective peace of the Pacific has been completely destroyed. The two countries are competing to establish military equipment to plan for a war. Hirota's hope of success in his policy towards the United States is very slim, and Japan's desire to devote all its efforts to military affairs on the mainland without any worries is just a beautiful fantasy.</p>
<p>According to the news obtained by the diplomatic correspondent of "Le Petit Parisien", Foreign Minister Flandin will submit four proposals to the League of Nations Council this afternoon:</p>
<h3 id="e18">French Foreign Minister Submits Four Proposals to the League of Nations; The League of Nations Association Must Maintain its Prestige in this One Fell Swoop; Otherwise, It Can Only Consolidate Itself with Allied Countries <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>One of the issues that the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty is in conflict with the Locarno Treaty is that France is willing to submit it to the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague for adjudication.</p>
<p>Before the Council of the League of Nations makes a decision on Germany's abolition of the treaty, it should immediately take preventive measures to prevent Germany from increasing the number of troops along the Rhine and building fortifications.</p>
<p>After the Council has made a decision, the mutual assistance clauses contained in the Locarno Treaty should be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>The British and French governments should immediately discuss appropriate measures to safeguard the security of both countries, prevent future threats from Germany, and negotiate and sign a new treaty to replace the Locarno Treaty.</p>
<p>The diplomatic correspondent of "Le Petit Parisien" also said that if this proposal by France is rejected, the country's enthusiasm for the League of Nations will inevitably be greatly reduced, or even return to its past alliance policy and consolidate itself with allied countries.

This invitation has been telegraphed by Ivanoe, the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, to the Berlin government. (Havas Electric dispatch from the 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The Council of the League of Nations has recently formally invited Germany to send representatives to attend the Council meeting. How Germany should reply to this matter, political figures are extremely tight-lipped. It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is quite hesitant. Foreign Minister Neurath held consultations with Director Blow of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Director of British Affairs Tieckhoff, and Hitler's confidant Ribbentrop, etc., until 8:00 PM. It is generally believed that the German reply will be sent to London tomorrow morning. According to semi-official sources, if Germany accepts the invitation and sends representatives to attend the Council meeting, then Ribbentrop and Tieckhoff will be selected to go to London.

<p>London: The representatives of the Locarno Treaty signatories, England, France, Belgium, and Italy, met in the British Foreign Office this afternoon to discuss and agree to temporarily refrain from taking any possible plans against Germany's action of abolishing the treaty, so as not to hinder the resolution of the Council of the League of Nations. According to the public report, once the Council of the League of Nations has decided on the document submitted by France and Belgium, the four countries will meet again. Before the meeting today, the British delegation had consulted with Prime Minister Baldwin and other cabinet members at 10 Downing Street. (Reuters Electric dispatch from the 14th)</p>
<p>London: The meeting of the Locarno Treaty signatories continued at 5:20 PM and ended at 6:57 PM. Those who participated in the meeting were French Foreign Minister Flandin, Minister without Portfolio Peng Gu, Belgian Prime Minister Jilin, Italian Ambassador Grandi, British Foreign Secretary Eden, Privy Councilor MacDonald, Justice Minister Hailsham, and Finance Minister Chamberlain. Prime Minister Jilin of Belgium proposed yesterday to submit the issue of whether the Locarno Treaty and the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty conflict with each other to the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague for adjudication, and at this time, to immediately start negotiations with Germany in accordance with the proposal made by Hitler. After the meeting today, French Foreign Minister Flandin opposed the proposal made by the Belgian Prime Minister, saying that this proposal should be discussed after the Council of the League of Nations announces that Germany has violated the treaty. He also advocated that all member states of the League of Nations should assist the Locarno Treaty signatories so as to restore the Rhine region to its original state in accordance with the provisions of Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the treaty. (Note: Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the Locarno Treaty states that whenever an act that destroys this treaty or violates Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles occurs, the Council of the League of Nations, once it is aware of it, shall immediately notify the signatories of this treaty, and each country promises to immediately provide assistance to the country that is the object of this violation.) After the meeting, a public report was issued stating, "The meeting of the Locarno Treaty signatories continued to exchange views today and decided to convene the next meeting after the Council of the League of Nations has taken a decision on the application matters of France and Belgium." Before the meeting today, French Foreign Minister Flandin had consulted with French Prime Minister Sarraut on the long-distance telephone to discuss the current situation. Flandin was originally scheduled to return home in the middle of next week to consult with the cabinet on the situation, but after this decision was made, the trip to Paris has been cancelled.

<p>Munich - The German Führer Hitler delivered a speech here today, stating that Germany will refuse the invitation to the League of Nations Council meeting in London on Monday. Germany cannot long endure the judgments of international tribunals. We will ignore threats and warnings. We can no longer tolerate unequal status, as it easily leads to rebellion and international hatred and fear. How can peace be achieved if one country is driven by hatred and another is dominated by mistrust? I do not want to make gestures that would damage Germany's honor. The whole world knows that Germany in 1918 was treated in a certain way, and they all believe that they can treat Germany today as they did then, but the reality is quite different. Our principle is that if other countries treat us equally, we are willing to cooperate; otherwise, we would rather sever ties. Germany deeply desires to conclude a Franco-German pact guaranteed by Britain and Italy, stipulating that in case of disputes, the League of Nations should determine who the aggressor is. Before France and Russia concluded a mutual assistance pact, I was determined to abide by the Locarno Treaty and allow the signatory countries themselves to determine who the aggressor was. I know that the time to implement this decision is approaching. France accuses Germany of being the aggressor. The subsequent changes are obvious. Many countries still regard Germany as the instigator of the First World War. This shows how easy it is to fabricate rumors. (National News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>Munich - Führer Hitler delivered an election speech in the open square here tonight. (The House of Representatives is scheduled to hold a by-election on the 29th of this month.) Forty special trains transported 300,000 people from various parts of Bavaria to listen to the speech. Hitler was originally scheduled to arrive here at 8 p.m., but due to drafting a reply to the League of Nations Council (the League of Nations Council has formally invited Germany to send representatives to attend the meeting to be held on Monday), an important meeting was held in Berlin in the afternoon, so his arrival was delayed until 9:30 p.m. The leaders of the National Socialist Party held a meeting at the "Vier Jahreszeiten Kempinski" hotel, presided over by the Führer himself, and had numerous telephone conversations with the Berlin Foreign Ministry. After the National Socialist Party meeting ended, the Führer drove to the open square, where 300,000 people cheered in unison. Amidst the rumble of celebratory cannons, Hitler ascended the podium with his head held high and spoke in impassioned words, "I ask the entire nation to support me so that I can strive and fight for the honor and rights of the country. This is the third time since 1933 that I have done so. My rearmament is not a game. On the contrary, I do not want our country to be attacked by other countries, hence this action. Peace cannot be realized if any nation does not obtain equal rights. I firmly believe this. The German nation is despised and treated worse than others. This is something I will never tolerate."</p>
<p>Hitler then said that after the German army entered the Rhineland, France asked Germany to make a compromise, saying, "As for the so-called compromise, I do not know what it means. What I have done is more than a compromise, because my words and deeds are consistent. I believe that the world will eventually be peaceful, but if other countries continue to oppress the oppressed nations, causing their desire for revenge to never be forgotten, how can the world order last? As for those who created the Treaty of Versailles, they were foolish and presumptuous in wielding their pens, and they had no foresight about the consequences. Now, after the signing of various treaties, many new facts have emerged before our eyes. Therefore, it is impossible to succeed without embracing a grand vision of sacrifice and modifying the current treaties based on facts. As for the continuous warfare to rectify Germany's borders, this is not what Germany desires," and so on. Before Hitler arrived at the meeting, Wagner, the leader of the National Socialist Party in this city, gave a speech to the crowd, saying, "We are here tonight because the world is full of falsehood and hypocrisy, and we must express our protest. The Führer Hitler's goal is to restore the German people to their inherent honor. We will never accept those who accuse us of tearing up treaties," and so on. After Hitler's speech tonight, the National Socialist Party's Stormtroopers held a large-scale parade, with members carrying torches and passing through the streets, with flags hanging everywhere along the way, creating a very enthusiastic atmosphere. (Havas News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>Führer Hitler recently delivered an election speech here, with the final paragraph saying, "Germany is a great nation in Europe, and other countries must treat it as a great nation." The Locarno Treaty, in Germany's view, is actually a "Truce of God" between Germany, France, and Belgium. (In the mid-11th century, Catholic bishops held a meeting in Nicaea and promulgated laws prohibiting believers from engaging in violence between Wednesday and the following Sunday, which is the so-called Truce of God.) At this point, Hitler again criticized the mutual assistance pact between France and Russia, saying, "Since France, Russia, the Czech Republic, and France have respectively established this pact, they can attack Germany at any time. I am the German Führer and am responsible for the country. I must consider the country's future. Moreover, after the establishment of the mutual assistance pact between France and Russia, no one can guarantee that communism will not harm France and Germany." Finally, Hitler reiterated the various peace proposals of Sweden and said that the House of Representatives will be re-elected on the 29th of this month so that the people can express their opinions on whether the Führer's policies are good or bad, whether Germany is richer or poorer, and whether the Führer can represent the people in the world. "I hope that the people can express their faith in their Führer on this day so that I can proclaim to the world that my words and deeds are not something I have obtained privately, but rather a manifestation of the German people's will," and so on.

<h3 id="e22">Difficult for Britain to Deal with the German Question, Cabinet Opinions Not Unified, Sanctions May Be Difficult to Implement <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>London - According to parliamentary sources, if France insists that Britain fulfill its obligations under the Locarno Treaty regarding Germany's abrogation of the treaty, the result will cause a storm in the British cabinet. All cabinet members acknowledge that these obligations are indeed valid, but most cabinet members are realists who, due to the unsuitable timing and dissenting public opinion, are unwilling for Britain to fulfill all of its obligations. Foreign Secretary Eden and Lytton Goebbels do not think so. If the two are forced by circumstances to demand that the cabinet adopt a tough attitude towards Germany, and all cabinet members cannot agree, the two will resign. Prime Minister Baldwin knows that once the two resign, it will be difficult for the cabinet to obtain the support of the majority in the House of Commons, so he feels quite embarrassed. Generally, when the cabinet met this afternoon, in addition to discussing the current situation, it also studied the negotiations among the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty and what repercussions it would have on British domestic affairs. It is rumored that six cabinet members advocate that the British cabinet take action to assist France's minimum demands (referring to restoring the Rhineland to its original state) and strive to achieve it. In that case, the number of hardliners in the cabinet has now increased. (Havas News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>London - Former Secretary of the Navy Churchill gave a speech in Birmingham yesterday, stating that if the League of Nations is unable to punish powerful aggressor countries, and Britain must deal with aggression alone in the future, once this situation is confirmed, the entire principle of collective security will be destroyed, the League of Nations will be completely defeated, and Britain will suffer great pain and shame. As for Germany's abrogation of the treaty, we must make it restore the rule of law before we can start negotiations. If the League of Nations is weak and incompetent and fails, we can only restore the old alliance system and resolve all disputes by force. (Havas News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>London - Regarding the issue of implementing sanctions against Germany, various military sanctions, such as sending troops to occupy the Rhineland, which could lead to war, have been rejected. The only remaining option is economic sanctions. British officials believe that Germany's deployment of troops to the Rhineland is a violation of Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles. Although the treaty is related to the League of Nations Covenant, Germany's actions cannot be regarded as a violation of the Covenant. Therefore, taking collective action to sanction Germany in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant is flawed and can be criticized in legal terms. The League of Nations Council passed a resolution on April 17 last year, advocating economic sanctions against countries that violate treaty obligations. This resolution can be used as a basis, but economic sanctions should be implemented only with the unanimous approval of the representatives of the Council's member states, which may be difficult to achieve.

<p>Rome - German Ambassador to Italy Hassel gave a speech here yesterday on the achievements of German Prime Minister Bismarck and Italian Prime Minister Cavour, stating that international treaties can resolve disputes for a time but cannot create lasting peace. The status quo they stipulate must be overthrown. This is why major events have occurred in the Red Sea and the Rhineland. What we hope for is that the great spirit displayed by Prime Minister Mussolini four years ago when he initiated the Four-Power Pact can be seen again today, so that new treaties can be established and the situation of division and disintegration in Europe can be clarified. Bismarck and Cavour are models for Europeans, not narrow-minded nationalists. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Führer Hitler have completed the great cause of unification. We must serve with common virtues to realize Cavour's motto of "unity and peace." (Havas News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>London - Regarding Germany's abrogation of the Locarno Treaty, well-informed sources here claim that the German government has notified Italian Prime Minister Mussolini that Italy is unlikely to support the application submitted by France and Belgium to the League of Nations Council yesterday.

General Haarlem has also arrived in the Rhineland with Wehrmacht staff officers, surveying the terrain day and night. At the same time, the German Embassy in London has issued a statement stating that the German troops in the demilitarized Rhineland, including the police, number only 36,500, and there are no armored divisions or bombers. The Rhineland accounts for one-eighth of Germany's total territory, including many important cities and towns, and its residents account for one-fifth of Germany's total population. Therefore, the number of occupying troops can only be regarded as symbolic. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

Many Americans believe that Hitler's real purpose is not France but Russia, but France is now bound by a Franco-Russian agreement, unless Hitler is willing to conclude the same non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, France can not accept Hitler's proposal to sign a non-aggression treaty with France, and this situation in Europe does not make the United States anxious, but the great military powers are more eloquent, and plan to promote huge naval and army expenditures in Congress.

<p>Rome - The government previously submitted the 1936-37 air force budget to the House of Representatives, totaling 99,000,000 lira, an increase of 141,000,000 lira compared to last year. The House Aviation Committee has reviewed it and submitted a report stating that the power of the Italian air force has become stronger after the war against Abyssinia. The engines installed on the current aircraft are all made in Italy. The fuel used has been invented by domestic technicians, and domestic alcohol and liquid hydrocarbons can be used as substitutes and improved. Soon, all domestic fuel can be used, and the import of gasoline and petroleum spirits can be reduced. As for the raw materials for making aircraft, foreign wood is no longer used.

<h3 id="e32">The Tragic Outcome of Smokers <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>My friend Mr. Zhou, talented and famous when young, was not unique in his melancholy, but he had an opium addiction, and he wallowed in the "black register" for more than twenty years. Although he inherited some land from his ancestors, which he could barely farm and eat from, he sold it off due to poor management, so that his wife left him, and his daughter became a prostitute. Alone, he had nowhere to go. Recalling more than ten years ago, I once strongly advised him to quickly take Feng's anti-addiction "Suffering-Relief Golden Pill" and quit smoking as soon as possible, but he didn't wake up. He even said he would get by. I recently heard from a friend that he had become a beggar, running around the streets all day, begging for pity, without shame. It is heartbreaking to hear this. If he had taken Feng's anti-addiction Suffering-Relief Golden Pill to quit his smoking habit earlier, he would not have fallen to this point. Although he is to blame, how many people in the world are like Mr. Zhou? I don't know how many people are saying this. I hope that the compatriots on the black list will wake up early, resolve to quit, and avoid regrets. Being despised by relatives and friends for smoking opium, why humiliate yourself? Suffering economic hardship for smoking opium, why create troubles for yourself? Violating national laws for smoking opium, why throw yourself into the net? Harming your health by smoking opium, why shorten your life? Using precious and useful money to smoke this harmful thing is truly the most foolish thing in the world. Friends on the black list can wake up! Feng's anti-addiction "Suffering-Relief Golden Pill" was invented in the seventh year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty, and it has been sixty-nine years since then. Hundreds of millions of people have taken this pill to quit. It is specially for quitting opium, morphine, heroin, etc. When quitting, you can smoke as usual. Every day, you will naturally feel disgusted with smoking. Light addicts need one or two doses, while severe addicts need four or five doses. Take one dose of the medicine every night before going to bed, and you will feel comfortable, without any pain, vomiting, or bias, and it will not affect your work. After taking the medicine, its power can guide the stagnation of smoke, moisturize Yang and nourish Yin, so that the amount of smoking gradually decreases naturally. It can also accurately determine the time of addiction, so that the time of addiction is gradually delayed. In a short period of time, you can completely quit smoking unconsciously. Everyone is satisfied, and everyone is satisfied. Many people send letters to thank us after quitting, and dozens of them are accumulated in the headquarters. Welcome to visit. Feng's anti-addiction "Suffering-Relief Golden Pill" has been praised by former Presidents Li, Xu, and Cao, and awarded by Zhang, the Chairman of the Central Anti-Smoking Committee, and praised by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Tianjin Anti-Drug Association. Customs and post offices are unimpeded. In addition to the above honors, Feng's "Suffering-Relief Golden Pill" is also used by various anti-smoking hospitals to help people quit smoking and achieve good results.

<p>Tokyo - The army is now studying countermeasures for the upcoming special parliament, including the expansion and reform of the troops stationed in China, which is a set plan. It will be implemented as soon as the budget is approved. Also, the 2 billion yuan six-year plan for national defense strengthening, a condition for Army Minister Terauchi's cabinet entry, is based on the active price increase and strengthening of air units and other new sharp units, and the established plan to increase divisions, etc. It will be implemented from the 12th year of the Showa era. If the Chinese communists invade Jin Province, or the situation in North China is urgent, the passage of the special parliament must not be awaited, and emergency measures should be taken. If the empire's international environment cannot wait for the convocation of the next regular parliament, then a temporary parliament should be convened to decide on the implementation of the six-year plan of 2 billion yuan (Reuters reported on the 15th)</p>

<p>Actively seeking reform in diplomacy and domestic affairs</p>
<p>Cabinet decision to be announced tomorrow</p>
<p>Tokyo - The policy platform of the new Hirota Cabinet was finalized at the cabinet meeting on the 17th. It will be declared to China and foreign countries immediately. Its contents emphasize implementation to adapt to the current situation. There will be considerable reforms in both domestic and foreign affairs. The contents are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Thorough implementation of clarifying the national essence and fundamental reform of the education system; Establishing an international position, determined to seek development through active diplomacy from within, taking the continental policy as the basis, clarifying Japan's role in stabilizing East Asia, adjusting international relations through active management from within; Enhancing national defense; National defense is an absolute requirement for national survival, therefore, it should be enhanced by referring to the current international situation; Fundamental reform of the fiscal and tax systems, adopting active fiscal policies, and at the same time, reforming the tax system to achieve a more equitable distribution of burden and to actively increase tax revenue; Electricity and essentials should be nationalized to stabilize people's livelihood. (15th, Same News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo - When Lieutenant General Terauchi joined the Hirota Cabinet, the army believed that in order to overcome the difficulties of the extraordinary situation, the four major national policies previously advocated should still be implemented, namely: Thorough implementation of clarifying the national essence, stabilizing the people's livelihood, strengthening national defense, and reforming diplomacy. It is hoped that, in the face of increasingly pressing international situations, the focus should be particularly on strengthening national defense capabilities. According to the plans of the General Staff Headquarters, a request to implement strengthening strategies was made. (15th, Domei News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Navy submitted an opinion to the Cabinet on the 11th regarding the renewal of national policy, expressing its desired direction of reform. When the Hirota Cabinet carries out active national policies, it will assist with all its strength to ensure complete success. Since 1931, Japan has been in an unconditional state, and the United States has long been implementing shipbuilding plans, scheduled to be completed by 1941, while Japan has not yet sought any countermeasures. If it is after 1941, the Japanese Navy will completely fall into an inferior ratio, which will cause a major risk to national defense. Therefore, the Navy believes that in the next few years, at least the security of national defense must be fully established. Therefore, the Navy is enthusiastically hoping that the Hirota Cabinet will resolutely implement new policies based on the fundamental principles of national defense. As for the Navy, it believes that there is still an active strategy, namely, to establish active policies for the peaceful economic development of the South Seas.

He said that Japan emulates Germany's efforts to strengthen the country, and today it can compete with Western countries for supremacy.

<p>Plan to Extend to Shanghai Not Fulfilled</p>
<p>London - Negotiations on the regular air passenger and postal service between Europe and Hong Kong, which have lasted for four and a half years, have now been successfully concluded. On the 23rd of this month, a Royal Airways aircraft will fly from Penang to Hong Kong. This is the official start of the air transport between Europe and Hong Kong. The aircraft will fly back to Penang on the 27th of this month, with one flight per week. It now takes only ten days from Hong Kong to London. As for the plan to extend the line to Shanghai, it has not been fulfilled due to difficulties in negotiations with the Chinese government. The line uses HD-86 aircraft, each of which can carry eight passengers, but because the line uses a lot of fuel, the exact number of passengers cannot be determined. The route will pass through Saigon or Tourane, and the entire journey will take one and a half days. Passengers can stay overnight in Saigon or Tourane. Currently, the aircraft can only carry travelers who have visas, because the Vietnamese government prohibits passengers from entering and leaving Vietnam by plane. (15th, Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Singapore - Japan has recently been trying to expand its influence in Siam. The Siamese Foreign Minister, Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena, has been lukewarm to this. Phahon recently went to Tokyo to meet with the Japanese Emperor and also discussed matters with Foreign Minister Hirota.

Siam is willing to maintain friendship with all countries and does not want to favor any particular country. Regarding the issue of Siam raising loans in London recently, Phahon said that from a political, moral, and practical standpoint, Siam only feels that Britain is its friendly country.

<h3 id="e63">The Underground Resources of China and the Strength of the Nation <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Weng Wenying</p>
<p>Weng Wenying, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, delivered a speech at a secret meeting in the capital some days ago. The text of his speech has now been compiled and is presented below.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the topic I am discussing today is "China's Underground Resources and the Strength of the Nation." Confucius said, "If a craftsman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools." If the tools are not good, the work will not be good. We can apply this principle to all other matters. When someone asked Confucius what the conditions for establishing a state were, Confucius said, "Sufficient food, sufficient military, and the trust of the people." This statement encompasses three aspects: preparedness, ample resources, and faith in the country. The term "food" includes not only food grains, and "military" includes not only guns and cannons, but also all necessary materials. Broadly speaking, this begins with the metallic resources underground. In ancient times, the relationship was still small, but in modern times, it is of great importance. Modern archaeological conclusions divide human culture into three periods: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. This kind of division existed in ancient China. For example, the Wu Yue Chunqiu and Yue Jue Shu both have similar records. At that time, the southern states of Wu and Chu were strong, and many crafts were passed down through specialized families, concentrated in the hands of a few. These families knew the history of their trade very well. Yue became strong by casting swords with iron. Chu asked the Wu person Feng Huzi about the materials used for casting weapons. Feng Huzi replied: "The military instruments have gone through three eras. Yu used jade and (muscle stone) as weapons; the Xia dynasty used bronze as weapons; and now we use iron as weapons. Only by using iron for military instruments can the nation become prosperous." However, with the advancement of modern culture, we are no longer in the age of iron, but in the age of steel. Steel weapons are stronger than iron. We not only need to use steel, but also need to produce large quantities of coal. Coal provides power, and power comes from coal and oil. Coal and oil both come from mineral deposits. There are many famous minerals today that were unknown to people in the past. For example, the element antimony. The Chinese language did not even have a corresponding character, so people did not know about it. This is also true for tungsten ore. There is a very special kind of tungsten ore in Hunan, which is slightly different from wolframite. It is called "the son of the lump of fire," something not found in dictionaries. Its discovery is more recent than that of antimony. It was discovered in southern Hunan around the years of the Republic, and it is the world's number one tungsten ore. This kind of ore has extremely important uses, especially in the manufacture of military instruments, where it is a necessary raw material. Modern countries must first have large-scale production, second must have power, and third must have important components. If a country does not have essential mineral resources, it cannot accomplish any of these three things. Now I will talk about the main mineral resources that have national and international significance, especially in China. We should view these issues with the standard of "treating others as we would like to be treated, and forgiving others as we forgive ourselves."</p>
<p>Steel and Iron. Steel and iron are the most important things among mineral resources. China uses 600,000 tons of steel annually, while the world produces 70 million tons annually. China uses less than one percent of the total. Of these 70 million tons of steel, the United States produces one-third, Britain produces one-tenth, and Germany produces one-tenth. As for the recent example of Soviet Russia, it used to produce less than two percent, but now its production has reached six percent. Japan's production accounts for four percent. But things are not always favorable. Japan's steel industry began at the same time as China's—that is, more than 30 years ago. During the Guangxu era, Zhang Zhidong established a steel and iron plant in Hanyang, and at the same time, Japan built the Yawata steel plant near Moji. Although Japan has abundant coal, it has little that can be used for steelmaking, and it also lacks iron sand. At this time, China happened to be establishing a steel plant, which was very expensive. Japan took advantage of this and signed a contract with China. China used the money from Japan to establish the steel furnace. Because of the long-term contract, Japan did not have to worry about the shortage of iron sand. In the second year of the Republic, the contract was revised, requiring the Hanyeping company to supply Japan with 35 million tons of iron sand, but the entire mine only contained 30 million tons. In addition, there is a mine in Fanshan County, Anhui Province, which also signed a long-term iron sand sales contract with Japan, selling the entire mine completely. Therefore, according to statistics, the iron ore sold to the Japanese along the Yangtze River amounts to more than 20 million tons. As far as China is concerned, the output is only 100 million tons, of which 20 million tons have already been sold, and a large amount is being transported to foreign countries, which is truly alarming. Of the 100 million tons of iron ore produced in China, there are 71 million tons in Liaoning, which is even more frightening. How can we make full use of the remaining 29 million tons? This is a very big question. Before the war, Japan's steel production was only 3 million tons, while China's was only 50,000 tons. Now, they produce 3 million tons, while China produces less than 1,000 tons, and the steel plants have all been shut down. This comparison makes us even more afraid. India's situation is similar to China's, but when we started using new-style steelmaking, they were still using old methods. In the eighth year of the Republic, when China established the Longyan steel plant, they also established the Tata steel plant. We hired Americans to design it, and they also hired Americans to design it. But now they can produce 1 million tons of pig iron, at a very low cost, and it is entirely managed by the Indians themselves. As for us, the Longyan steel plant was successfully built, but it has never been fired up, which is truly shameful. Originally, China attached great importance to the iron and steel policy. Now, we must first promote the establishment of steel plants ourselves, and second, the export of iron sand should be managed by the government. No matter who sells iron sand to foreigners, the time should not be too long, and the quantity should be carefully considered, so that it can supply our own steelmaking.</p>
<p>Tungsten. China produces the most tungsten ore in the world, and it is famous for its rich tungsten production. It is said that China's tungsten production accounts for 80% of the world's total. In the past eight years, there have been considerable changes. In the most recent year, its production accounts for about 60% of the world's total. The use of tungsten is very limited in peacetime, mainly used to make lead type. However, in wartime, the use of tungsten is particularly large. Because its melting point is very high, it is an indispensable material for making military instruments such as armor-piercing bullets. The price of tungsten can be used to gauge the danger of the international situation, like a barometer. The higher the price of tungsten, the more dangerous the international situation. The lower the price of tungsten, the less likely a major crisis will occur. The world's tungsten production is more than 16,000 tons, and China's is 12,000 tons, accounting for three-quarters. Although the production is large, the situation is not reassuring. China's tungsten smelting can produce 99.97% pure tungsten, but the new smelting technology can achieve 99.99%. Mexico is now using new smelting technology, and the Americans are selling it to China's competitors. Now the government is considering establishing a bureau to deal with this situation.</p>
<p>Tin. Tin is rarely used in peacetime. Its main use is to add it to iron for steelmaking. However, modern weapons cannot do without tin; without tin, they will suffer losses. The main tin-producing countries in the world are China and Burma. The world's total tin production is 140,000 tons, of which China accounts for 60,000 tons and Burma accounts for 50,000 tons. If China does not seek progress, Burma will soon catch up. The global sale of tin is mainly in the hands of the British and Chinese governments. China currently does not have the capital to make good use of it. Britain can sell it for a long time, and the United States, Germany, Japan, and Italy must buy it from Britain and China. However, the sale of tin is closely related to other countries, and it cannot be compared to ordinary commercial transactions. The British Armstrong Company once asked the Chinese government to transfer the right to sell tin to Britain. Fortunately, this negotiation did not succeed. We should prioritize the interests of the country and support it well, because it is closely related to military affairs and politics.</p>
<p>Coal and Oil. In addition to factories, cars and airplanes need gasoline; gasoline is refined from oil. Countries without oil will face great difficulties with gasoline in wartime. For example, in the Abyssinian War, the League of Nations imposed an oil embargo. If implemented, Italy would have faced great difficulties. Therefore, oil deposits are extremely important. Japan uses more than 2.2 million tons of oil annually, of which 470,000 tons are used by the navy. Japan can supply more than 200,000 tons itself, Taiwan supplies 300,000 tons, Karafuto 300,000 tons, and Liaoning Fushun 100,000 tons, totaling 900,000 to 670,000 tons. The difference of 1.7 million tons is imported: 1 million tons from the United States and 700,000 tons from Southeast Asia. As for the accumulation of oil, we can estimate the reserves. According to estimates by Americans and Russians, Japan's oil reserves are 400,000 to 670,000 tons, enough for about one year of use. Not only oil, but also copper and iron are like this. Japan produces 3 million tons of steel annually, and in addition to buying iron sand from China, Korea, and Malaya, it imports 4 million tons. Japan produces only 200,000 tons itself, and the rest is imported from foreign countries. Japan's iron sand reserves are 9 million tons. Therefore, a country must pay attention to necessary resources not only in wartime, but also in peacetime. Otherwise, it will face great difficulties when the time comes. The League of Nations' collective security and non-aggression treaty requires countries at war to deal with it, and countries not at war must also deal with it. Therefore, buying from foreign countries in wartime is not easy, so we must prepare in peacetime.</p>
<p>All countries in the world attach great importance to mineral resources. Everyone is working hard in two directions: one is to vigorously improve the production of their own country, and the other is to facilitate the supply from foreign countries, such as signing contracts and treaties. In China's situation, especially with regard to iron sand and steel, we must pay special attention to their disposition. We must develop it and protect it, and we should pay special attention to the greenness of important mineral resources. On the one hand, we should promote international trade, but on the other hand, we should also store up our own strength. To stand in the world, we must have considerable strength. This kind of strength comes from two sources: people and land. People must do their best, and the land must be used to its full potential. Only by using the power of people to develop the riches of the land can the country begin to develop its power.</p>

Regarding baojia and local autonomy, the general proposal is to integrate baojia into autonomy, without neglecting either one, but funding must be expedited, and the training of police and detectives should be unified, and police education should be unified, and funding should be determined. Regarding the administrative organization of county construction, adjustments to construction, the establishment of goals, and the cultivation of talent were all discussed extensively. The responsible representatives for education and health provided detailed reports. The county bureau chiefs also provided detailed accounts of the implementation of policies on civil education, the promotion of compulsory education, and they advocated levying inheritance tax to make up for the shortfall. Health undertakings must also first solve the funding problem. Finally, Jiang Tingzuo delivered a speech, hoping that local officials would raise county administration issues at any time for discussion and efficiency, hoping to help research and resolve solutions, and hoping that county bureau chiefs would provide practical experience for efficiency meetings at any time, so as to learn from each other.

<p>— Travel Notes from Sichuan</p>
<p>— Record of Hardships</p>
<p>2 Chongqing Escape</p>
<p>Chongqing sits at the confluence of the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers. During the Spring and Autumn Period, it was the capital of the Ba Kingdom. Under the Qin Dynasty, it became Ba Commandery. The Tang Dynasty called it Yu Prefecture, and the Song Dynasty renamed it Chongqing in support of a new beginning. This is a city on a hillside, surrounded by water on three sides, forming a peninsula. Fifteen miles west of the city is the Fotu Pass, which controls the throat of the ancient Chengdu-Chongqing route, the closest point between the two rivers before they merged. The Fotu Pass is a narrow and precipitous cliff, a strategic location that was a battleground for military strategists. The mountain is narrow and long, resembling a goose's neck, while the city resembles the goose's body. If you were to use Shanghai's Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek as a comparison, then the Wenbei district on the north bank of the Jialing River would be Zhabei, and the south bank across the Yangtze River would be like Pudong. In terms of topography, they are also quite similar. The north bank is a less developed area in terms of material civilization, while the south bank is the rural area that nurtures the prosperity of the city.</p>
<p>The city's streets rise and fall with the terrain, and the buildings are constructed at varying heights. There are stone steps going up and down slopes, as well as modern roads. There are dilapidated mansions and the latest Western-style buildings. The means of transportation are both old and new. It is not uncommon to see antique sedan chairs and streamlined 1936 automobiles running side by side on the streets. Public buses are very developed, but unfortunately, they are not well managed. The rear of the buses emits plumes of black smoke, forcing pedestrians to cover their noses and hurry past. Sedan chairs are a type of covered litter, the only means of transportation for narrow and remote alleys where cars cannot pass. There is also a type called "big sedan chair," which is a high-backed sedan chair carried by four or six people taking turns. It is made with delicate rattan chairs, and the ends of the sedan poles are extra long, making it more stable when going uphill or downhill. These are privately owned by wealthy or obese individuals. Every time I see these sedan chairs, with servants shouting and clearing the way, rushing ahead, the pomp and circumstance often arouse in me the "he could be replaced by me" sense of decline. Indeed, a wealthy person in Chongqing would rather have a big sedan chair than a cheap car. Cars are just a toy.</p>
<p>The municipal management seems too poor. Compared with Qingdao and Hong Kong, which have similar situations and are also mountain cities, there is a vast difference. Vehicles on the roads originally drove on the right, but later, with the implementation of the New Life Movement, they were changed to the left. Now, even a very narrow pedestrian path is divided into left and right halves for separate traffic. Public utilities, besides the smoke-belching buses, include streetlights, telephones, toll-free radio stations, and tap water with stations for selling water. There is also a park, but it is not as good as any of the private villas owned by military officers along the Jialing River.</p>
<p>Chongqing University is the only institution of higher learning in Chongqing, founded single-handedly by Chairman Liu Xiang. It has only been around for four years, so naturally, one cannot criticize its facilities using conventional standards. However, its campus on the banks of the Jialing River is beautiful and secluded, truly an excellent place for studying. If calculated per capita, Chongqing probably has more secondary schools than Shanghai, with a total number of over thirty. Primary schools are even more developed, and traditional private schools continue to operate. Naturally, with so many schools, there is a high demand for teachers. However, there are even more people eager to become teachers, leading to the so-called "Sixth and Twelfth Month Wars" – the activities of the education sector during the winter and summer vacations. The term of office for principals, except for missionary schools and a very few private schools, is usually no more than one academic year. Teachers are not considered full-time or part-time but are merely a token response to the recommendation letters of influential people by the principal. A close friend of mine teaches at four secondary schools that are very far apart, teaching over forty-two hours per week. I asked him how he manages to teach so much. He told me a clever trick to be in many places at once: he takes a week off from each school in rotation each month, so he can handle it with ease.</p>
<p>Chongqing is an economic center and a military center. Officials, politicians, merchants, and the wealthy are all active there. To meet their needs, hotels, restaurants, theaters, and all the other pleasures that a metropolis should provide are extremely developed. Dumei Street is Chongqing's Nanjing Road, a gathering place for department stores and the business hub for foreign merchants. If you walk into a store, the clerks will point to the goods and tell you, "This is from Shanghai, this is Jiangnan goods." The so-called Shanghai or Jiangnan goods are mostly Western goods.</p>
<p>Sichuan opera mostly uses Qin melodies, with loud, sonorous, and exciting tunes that people from Jiangdong find boring. Sichuan cuisine, on the other hand, is most famous for the Chengdu flavor. The characteristics of Sichuan cuisine are oiliness, spiciness, sourness, and tenderness. Most dishes are stir-fried with heavy oil and immediately served, without stewing. Chongqing's currents are swift, making it difficult to find aquatic products. Carp is considered a delicacy, and shrimp and crabs are even rarer. Pork is an essential main dish for every meal, while preserved meat and sausages are the only common household foods. If you want to eat yellow croaker or mandarin fish, it is truly "a horseshoe crab hanging from your nose" (an impossibility). Therefore, outsiders who come to Sichuan for the first time often lament "no fish to eat," and Sichuan people get used to eating oily food. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day for them, so they don't pay much attention to snacks. Lunch is called "Xiangwu" (midday meal), and dinner is called "Xiaoye" (late-night snack), suggesting that they are more important. Especially for children, because adults want them to go to bed early, they often prefer a late-night snack. The time for banquets is usually set for two or three in the afternoon, but in reality, they must wait until six or seven o'clock before they can begin.</p>
<p>Sichuan has always been known as the "Land of Abundance," with many special products. The white fungus produced in the deep mountains on the border of Sichuan and Guizhou is highly praised, with large, white, slightly yellow ones being the best. The snow-white ones on the Shanghai market, although beautiful, are of inferior quality. Jiading silk and Chengdu brocade are famous products, sold in shops around Shaanxi Street.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Smuggling Organizations in Southern Fujian <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Main Office is Located in Xiamen</p>
<p>Branch Offices are Established Throughout the Interior</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Tax evasion and smuggling are extremely prevalent in Xiamen and the coastal areas of southern Fujian. Since the Third Pacification Command destroyed the Nan Shun Foreign Firm, a smuggling organization operating out of Shilian Town outside the South Gate of Quanzhou, smugglers in Jinjiang and Hui'an have been losing their nerve, either suspending operations or relocating to conceal their activities. According to recent news from Quanzhou, the smuggling organizations established by unscrupulous merchants actually have their headquarters in Xiamen, with branch offices in Zhangzha of Hui'an, Tatao of Anhai, and Shijing of Jinjiang. Most of the key members are from Takku of Hui'an. Because Hui'an is located on the coast, close to Taiwan, and many residents make a living by sailing, no fewer than three hundred people have been relying on smuggling for their livelihood since the commencement of smuggling operations. The main office in Xiamen is located on Kaiyuan Road, formed by four foreign firms with a capital of over 500,000 yuan. Their smuggling routes depart from a small island near Taiwan, transshipping to the coastal areas of Jinjiang, Nan'an, and Hui'an, with well-fortified storage rooms (i.e., smuggled goods warehouses) along the way and a wide network of informants to prevent detection. They have established radio stations for communication. Even if there is a leak, it is difficult to completely crack down. It is said that the main company was established in 1934, and its initial scale was small. After the horizontal announcement of the implementation of legal tender last year, the company made huge profits by smuggling silver, and then expanded its organization and established branch offices throughout the interior. According to those familiar with the situation, Zeng Moujie, who was captured in Shishi, was the general manager of the branch offices in the Quanzhou area, directing the loading and unloading of goods in various branch offices. Zhuang Yankui was the contact person for the main company in Xiamen, responsible for public relations and liaison. He happened to be dispatched by the main company to Shishi to negotiate, so he was also arrested. The staff of the main company in Xiamen have already fled one after another. Quanzhou is currently temporarily entrusted to a certain dentist to preside over the affairs, intending to first find a way to rescue the detainees. They have been sending people to Quanzhou for activities in recent days. The authorities attach great importance to this matter and are making every effort to investigate. (March 15)</p>
<h3 id="e88">Travel Notes from Hubei and Guangdong (None) (Travel Correspondence from Our Newspaper Reporter) A Trip to the South <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Junhao</p>
<p>Since arriving in Wuhan on the second of this month, it has been five days today (the sixth). Every day has been shrouded in haze, and I have not seen the sun once. A friend told me that it rains frequently in Hunan Province, and there are rainy days for more than two-thirds of the year. If it is overcast and there is no sunlight, it can already be considered a sunny day. You should consider yourself lucky and not be dissatisfied. On the morning of the sixth, we took bamboo sedan chairs to tour the mountains. First, we went to the Zhisheng Temple, a magnificent building with ancient, verdant trees. After lingering for a while, we left. After exiting the temple, the sedan chair carriers, seeing my weight, asked to add another carrier, jokingly saying to me, "You are very lucky." I did not understand their meaning at first, but after Mr. Zhong Shusheng told me the reason, I couldn't help but smile! After leaving Zhisheng Temple, we saw many paddy fields along the way. A stream meandered through the rocks, and we gradually heard the sound of water, like thunder. After half an hour, we arrived at the Water Curtain Cave, a waterfall that plunged down from a great height. It is said that its source is on Mount Zhurong. The waterfall is not wide, but it is light and bright like a curtain. On a large rock next to the waterfall are engraved the words "Unceasing Day and Night," "High Mountains and Flowing Water," and "Where to Go and Where to Come." After touring the Water Curtain Cave, we traveled for some time to Nanyue City. The so-called Nanyue City is the street market in front of the Nanyue Temple. It is said that since the Tang and Song Dynasties, those who visited the mountains and burned incense have stopped here. Over time, it became prosperous and developed into a city. There are various shops in the city, and many old-fashioned hotels. During July and August, pilgrims from all over the world come to Nanyue to offer incense, and most of the hotels are full. From here, we entered the Nanyue Temple, a magnificent temple comparable to the Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou. The aisle is very long, with rows of pine and cypress trees, which is extremely beautiful. The most special thing is that the main hall is surrounded by a long corridor. The construction method is the same as that of the palaces in the ancient capital of Beiping. The long corridor is surrounded by stone railings, and the stone slabs of the railings are all carved with trees, flowers, and birds, all of which are exquisite. It is said that the total number of pilgrims who come here every year is more than 200,000, and many people from the Jiangzhe area, such as Shanghai, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, also go there, which can be said to be a grand occasion. After the Nanyue Temple, we climbed the mountain. The mountain roads are all newly built roads, which are very easy to walk. The situation is the same as the new roads on Mount Mogan. However, looking at the snow-capped mountain peaks in the distance, the cold wind hit us, and we shivered in the sedan chairs. After walking for a short time, we arrived at Luosi Pool, another waterfall, with a loud sound of water. The waterfall folds several times, which is more beautiful than the Water Curtain Cave. After advancing from here, we passed the Jade Plate Bridge. The terrain became higher, and the climate became colder. It was much colder than the coldest winter weather in Shanghai. At that time, snowflakes were floating, and we couldn't stand the cold and cried out in pain. After moving forward for several miles, we finally reached Banshan Pavilion, which is halfway from the foot of the mountain to the top. We went to the China Travel Service Hostel, gathered around the stove for dinner, and the cold was greatly reduced. There are more than a dozen rooms here, which is the best place in the whole mountain. It is not inferior to Mount Lu for summering, and it will be open this summer. After dinner, because the weather was cold and the road was slippery, and the snow had not stopped, we could not go up further, so we took another new road down the sunny side of the mountain. Because this section faces the sun, there are more trees, and the scenery is gradually better. On the way, we passed the Mogging Terrace, and nearby is a villa built by He Jian, Chairman of Hunan Province. Further down, we toured Fuyan Temple and Nantai Temple, both of which are built on the mountain and have excellent environments. Nantai Temple also has more than 5,000 volumes of Tibetan scriptures sent by Japanese monks, stored in a small building's bookcase, with a stone tablet recording the event. In addition, there are thirty-two Buddha images on palm leaves, with exquisite workmanship, which are masterpieces. We then went down the mountain and still went to the Travel Service Hostel at the foot of the mountain for a short rest.</p>
<p>Overall, the beauty of Nanyue lies in its breadth, grandeur, and wonder. The temples and historical sites are scattered everywhere and cannot be compared to those that can be seen all at once. The mountain is more than 3,000 feet high, which is very suitable for summering. In addition, the Hunan Provincial Government has set up a bureau to manage everything, so the future is promising. Those who come from Hankou can take a car from Changsha to the mountain, and those who come from Guangdong can change trains from Hengyang to the mountain. After a short rest at the Travel Service, we were accompanied by Director Yang Yufen of the Zhushao Bureau and took a car to Hengyang, which took two hours to reach. We crossed the river outside Hengyang City to the east bank of the river and stayed at Mr. Yang's residence.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Travelogue of Qinghai (Continued) <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuang Xueben</p>
<p>The Locals are Mongols</p>
<p>We can now conclude that the ethnicity of the Qinghai natives is of Mongol origin:</p>
<p>In the past, some people said that they were descendants of Li Keyong of the Shatuo State. The so-called Shatuo State—is the present-day Shatuo in Xinjiang; northwest of Dihua, Suilai, Fukang, Fuyuan, Qitai counties, five hundred li in length and three hundred li in width, now called Gurbantunggut Desert. The Tang Dynasty called it Shatuo. It is east of Pulei, and south of Jinpo Mountain, belonging to a separate part of the Western Turkic Khaganate. Later it was attached to the Uyghurs. — This theory exists because Li Tusi is a descendant of Li Keyong, but this only applies to a small number of nobles and cannot be attributed to the majority of the indigenous people. Moreover, many of the Tusi are Mongols or from Jiangnan. Checking the genealogy of the Li Tusi, since the Yuan Dynasty, the Mei brothers Guguan Luji divided the Hongyagou territory, and in the Ming Dynasty, the Li Ying and Li Xiong brothers were granted the titles of Marquis of Huining and Earl of Gaoyang, which were hereditary. At that time, they were all called native people, and now the people of Qinghai also call them Turen, so it is very clear that they are genuine Qinghai natives, not immigrants from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Now the Xizhuang people call them "Kalong," and they call themselves "Mongol Er." Their language is Mongolian. They have great and strong builds, yellow skin, black pupils, and thick lips. Their neighbors are also close to the Mongols. These few significant features can prove that they are a branch of the Mongolian ethnicity.</p>
<p>In the past, they had a glorious war history with their Tusi, and they all contributed to the suppression of border disturbances in the Western Regions in previous dynasties. Because they used to be good at martial arts, their culture is now backward, and they are lazy to cultivate. However, they have loyal personalities, strong physiques, intelligent minds, and beautiful faces. If the government can provide appropriate education, they can restore their past glory.</p>
<p>Statistics of Native People</p>
<p>The above is based on the county government's survey in the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933], totaling more than 5,800 people. Recent population figures are not available.</p>
<p>Besides being centered in Huzhu County, the Qinghai natives also live scattered in Datong, Xining, Gonghe, Minhe, Ledu, and five other counties. However, most have been sinicized and are difficult to distinguish. The total number of natives in Qinghai Province is estimated by the author to be about 20,000 to 30,000.</p>
<p>Huzhu County Tusi</p>
<p>Li Tusi (see previous chapter 6)</p>
<p>Dongqi Tusi (see previous chapter 13)</p>
<p>Xiqi Tusi is of Mongolian ethnicity. In the fourth year of Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty, Nanmu Ge led craftsmen to surrender and was awarded the title of Commander Qian Shi for his merits. His grandson Zaifu was promoted to Commander for his merits. By the time of his ninth-generation grandson, Zaidengyuan, after resigning from his post in the 24th year of Wanli, he was promoted to the garrison commander of Tumun Fort. In the early Qing Dynasty, Chengyuan's son Wang Shenglong surrendered in the second year of Shunzhi and inherited the position of Commander Qian Shi in the fourth year. Later generations inherited the position. Now he lives in Haizigou, forty li west of Xining County, and the natives of Huzhu County are under his jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Na Tusi is of Mongolian ethnicity. In the fourth year of Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty, Shami led his tribe to surrender and was awarded the title of General Flag. Shami's son, Nasula, was promoted to Deputy Thousand Household in the first year of Yongle for his merits. By the time of his sixth-generation grandson, Na Rong, he inherited the position during the Jiajing period and was promoted to Commander Qian Shi for his merits. By the time of his ninth-generation grandson, Na Ruyan, after inheriting the position in the 31st year of Wanli, he was promoted to Guerrilla of the Guyuan Standard. In the early Qing Dynasty, Na Ruyan's son, Na Yuanbiao, surrendered in the second year of Shunzhi and inherited the position of Commander Qian Shi in the tenth year. Later generations inherited the position. Now he lives in Najiazhuang, twelve li south of Xining County, and is now residing in Xichuan. The natives of Najia Dongyuan and other villages under the jurisdiction of Huzhu County are there.</p>
<p>Chen Tusi is originally from Shanyang, Jiangnan. His ancestor, Chen Ziming, was the Right Vice Minister of Huai'an during the Yuan Dynasty. In the first year of Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty, he was awarded the title of Commander. Ziming's son, Chen Yi, inherited the position in the 17th year of Hongwu and was transferred to the Xining Guard Commander for his merits. By the time of his sixth-generation grandson, Chen Zhi, he inherited the position and also managed the military affairs of the camp. Later, he died in battle and was posthumously awarded the title of Deputy Commander-in-Chief. By the time of his tenth-generation grandson, Chen Guangxian, he inherited the position during the Wanli period and was promoted to Left Assistant General of Zhuanglang. In the early Qing Dynasty, Chen Guangxian's son, Chen Shiwen, surrendered in the second year of Shunzhi and inherited the position of Commander in the ninth year. He was promoted to Niangou Garrison Commander for his merits. Later generations inherited the position. Now he lives in Chenjiatai, in the western district of Huzhu County.</p>
<p>Ji Tusi is of Mongolian ethnicity. There was Ji Bao who surrendered in the early years of Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty and was awarded the title of Hundred Household and transferred to the Zhenfu of the Jinyi Guard's former institute. By the time of his grandson, Jixiang, he inherited the position in the 20th year of Yongle and was promoted to Commander Qian Shi for his merits. In the early Qing Dynasty, Ji Tianxi surrendered in the second year of Shunzhi and inherited the hereditary position of Commander Qian Shi in the twelfth year. He lives in Jijiazhuang, sixty li west of Xining County. (The above is taken from "Recent Qinghai One")</p>

<p>Theft Case Quickly Solved</p>
<p>Changshu, 14th: An unprecedented robbery occurred here this afternoon. Fortunately, the victim vigorously pursued the thief. The victim, Chen Quan, employed by Ji Guoping's family in Zhong Sheng Lane, was ordered to withdraw 900 yuan in foreign currency from the Bank of China this afternoon. The money had been eyed by criminals. When Chen Quan arrived at a small alley in Zhong Sheng Lane, Chen Quan was violently struck in the face by a large man, Chen fainted and fell to the ground. The man then stole the banknotes and fled. However, Chen, due to the money being stolen, endured the pain and chased after him, shouting for the thief to be caught. Unexpectedly, the thief was also in a hurry and came up with an idea, blowing his own police whistle wildly, falsely reporting a fire. When he reached Mutou Lane, a rickshaw puller and a tailor happened to be coming from the opposite direction and captured him. Fortunately, the stolen items were not scattered. He was then sent to the Public Security Bureau. The thief confessed his name as Chen Youbin, a resident of the city, and claimed that there was a misunderstanding along the way and that he was not robbing. Because the authorities considered this case to be an unprecedented daylight robbery case that was quickly solved, they are paying close attention to it. It will be handed over to the county for investigation on the 16th, which is a Saturday.</p>
<p>Various Industries Rectify Accumulated Grain and Solicit Donations</p>
<p>Jiaxing: The Jiaxing County Government has promulgated interim measures for raising accumulated grain, stipulating the amount of grain that shops should donate. The public offices in various towns have begun to solicit donations. However, when dispatching personnel to solicit donations from various shops, they do not follow the measures issued by the county government, and the starting capital amount does not follow the capital declared in the original business tax. They often forcibly increase the amount, exceeding the quota, causing repeated complaints. Various shops have reported this to their respective trade associations, and the trade associations have jointly requested the County Chamber of Commerce to come forward and preside over the matter, striving for the authorities to continue to follow Article 7 of the interim measures, which stipulates that the capital of the merchant Tang Dynasty should be based on the records of the Business Tax Bureau when soliciting accumulated grain, so as to comply with the law. After receiving the report, the County Chamber of Commerce has requested the County Magistrate to instruct the public offices of various towns to comply with it.</p>
<p>Su-Jia Road Adds Branch Line</p>
<p>The Su-Jia Railway is scheduled to open to traffic on May 1st. Currently, the railway tracks are being laid, and the foundations of the four and six bridges on the Jiaxing section are not very solid, so they are being dismantled and rebuilt. According to reliable sources, the railway will also open a route from Sinai in Jiaxing County to connect to the Ma Huang Tang Bridge, so the Ma Huang Tang Bridge area needs to be opened as a branch station. The line is currently being surveyed by the engineering office.</p>
<p>Agricultural Bank Adds Five Offices</p>
<p>Hangzhou: The China Farmers Bank has recently transferred 300,000 yuan in new banknotes to Hangzhou for circulation in the market. It is reported that the bank plans to add offices in Jiangshan, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Wu Yu, and five other locations in order to help rural areas develop their businesses. It will explore establishing them first and starting business operations.</p>

<p>Report by Mr. Lu</p>
<p>After the formal ceremony, Chairman Lu Jingshi gave a report, stating briefly: "Our association held the first National Postal Workers' Congress in Shanghai on December 1, 1929. Although it was very simple on the surface, it was very inspiring in spirit. On July 21, 1932, we held the second Congress in Nanjing. Today, we are holding the third Congress in this city. The original articles of association stipulated that a Congress should be held every two years, but due to various reasons, the Executive Committee of the General Union decided to postpone it for two years. In today's meeting, the delegates participating are very enthusiastic, and the delegates from all over the country, thousands of miles away, have come from afar to participate, which is deeply gratifying. In today's meeting, there are also postal worker representatives from several provinces in the Northeast, which makes people feel infinitely sad. When we hold the National Congress here, on the one hand, we should review everything ourselves, such as how to improve and correct the past association affairs, how to seek continuous development for our own welfare, and how to seek soundness in postal affairs. I hope that all delegates can contribute their opinions as much as possible. At the same time, we see that the current national crisis in our country is serious. The seriousness of the national crisis is due to the pressure exerted by imperialism and the constraints of various unequal treaties. However, we look around the world at countries such as Soviet Russia, Italy, and Germany. In this complex and severe international situation, under the leadership of a sound leader, they have broken away from all constraints and become powerful in the world. Our country must also have a leader to lead the entire nation to fight for national salvation. We also recall that in the recent revolutionary history of China, after Chairman Chiang Kai-shek led the revolutionary soldiers to the successful Northern Expedition, he also severely suppressed the communist bandits. During this period when the country was in an extremely serious situation due to various relations, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek remained tireless and maintained the Chinese nation in this difficult and arduous situation. Therefore, if we want to seek national salvation and survival, abolish unequal treaties, and recover lost territories, we can only support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as our leader to lead the entire nation to fight." (Applause from everyone) Finally, today we are holding this Congress here. The spring is bright and the weather is warm, so this association will discuss all association affairs and will be able to cooperate sincerely and achieve bright and upright results.</p>
<p>Speech by Mr. Lin</p>
<p>Lin Meiyan, the representative of the Municipal Party Department, said in his speech, "I am very happy to participate in this grand meeting today. The soundness of your association's organization and the excellence of its members are truly superior to all other trade unions in the country. However, I hope that your association should take the responsibility of leadership so that all other trade unions in the country can regard this as a model and also tend to be sound and excellent. Just now, the chairman mentioned that to save China's crisis, we must wait for the leader's guidance. The leader is like the brain of a person. Without a brain, all actions will lose their direction and become unconscious. If the human organization is like this, why is the national organization not so? The brain of the country is a hard-working and meritorious leader. Mussolini of Italy, Hitler of Germany, and Stalin of Soviet Russia are absolutely worshiped and believed by the people of each country. Therefore, each country can be of one mind to seek the development of the country and the nation. Today, China has Chairman Chiang Kai-shek who has dedicated himself to the country and fought for the nation. He is the only leader of China today. The people of our country should unanimously support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to lead the entire nation and work hard for national salvation and survival. Your association is the most sound and excellent trade union in our country, and all industrial circles regard it as a model, so you should call out from a high place and make all industrial circles follow your association to seek survival for the nation and seek revival for the country."</p>
<p>Speeches by Mr. Wang and Mr. Cheng</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Speaker of the Municipal Council, said in his speech, "I am deeply honored that your association is holding its third Congress today with such vigorous spirit and enthusiasm. I have always regarded the postal workers' union in my mind as an organized and disciplined trade union, but trade unions should be feared by the general public. I think this kind of fear is a good phenomenon because of the manifestation of its strength. However, this kind of strength should not be shown to the people of the country, but should be shown to foreigners. In the future, your colleagues should also know and act in unison so that you will not be regarded by others as merely chanting high-sounding slogans. All the slogans in the venue today can be realized one by one." Cheng Haifeng of the International China Labor Bureau said in his speech, "The soundness of your association's organization has been recognized by the general public. I have inspected the labor situation in China. With the introduction of the person in charge of your association, I was able to contact the postal workers' unions in various parts of the country with great convenience, which shows the strictness of your association's organization. I hope that your association will continue to work hard for this purpose." Ren Jinpin of the Local Association and Zhou Xuexiang of the General Federation of Trade Unions also gave speeches. The length of the speeches is omitted.</p>
<p>Chairman's Big Thanks</p>
<p>Finally, Chairman Lu Jingshi gave a reply, saying briefly: "I am deeply grateful for the guidance of the representatives of the superiors and the encouragement of the guests today. In the future, this association will work harder and seek the happiness of the country and society."</p>

<h3 id="e91">French Female Journalist Dieta Nashi Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>According to the Outer Comments Section of the Continental News, Madame Dieta Nashi, a well-known French female journalist, after touring Japan and Northeast China, arrived in Shanghai by plane from North China the day before yesterday, and plans to return to Paris by plane on Tuesday (17th). According to her, when she arrived in Tokyo, it coincided with the military coup, and martial law was declared throughout the city. She also said that she had met with many Japanese political leaders in Japan. After receiving news of the Japanese incident in Shanghai, Die bought a ferry ticket to Japan, hoping to witness the situation in Tokyo at that time and provide news to her home country newspaper. When she arrived in Tokyo, the area was still under martial law, and someone told her that she could not leave the station and could only turn back. Die asked to make a phone call to the French embassy to tell them what had happened. The embassy agreed to send a car to the station to welcome her and told her that everything could be arranged. Soon after, she went to the embassy. At that time, French expatriates living in Tokyo, fearing outside disturbances, were all sheltering in the embassy. It is said that the situation at the U.S. Embassy was also similar. When the incident was not settled, more than 80 American expatriates all stayed at the embassy. Madame Die saw that there was no danger locally and went out to investigate for news purposes and interviewed many important Japanese figures. When she had time, she telegraphed everything to Paris for reporting. After order was restored in Tokyo, Madame Die decided to leave and took a plane to Changchun, Manchukuo. She saw that the people there were even more alarmed by the Tokyo incident than the citizens of Tokyo. In Changchun, she met with Puyi. She then left Manchukuo and went to Beiping, where she saw that the people there were all uneasy about the future. After staying for a few days, she came to Shanghai and is now scheduled to take a plane to Guangzhou on Tuesday, the 17th. After arriving in Guangzhou, she plans to hire a plane to Hanoi, and then take a French plane to Bangkok, and then transfer to a Dutch-British Airways plane to return to Paris.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Bank Draft Acceptance House Established Today and Begins Operations. Committee Established, Headed by Zhu Boquan as Manager. Thirty-Two Banks Join as Members, Subscribing to Membership Fees and Entering Agreements to Accept Drafts. <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the Shanghai market has been extremely depressed due to the outflow of silver, financial panic, and other influences. General industry and commerce, because transactions usually rely on credit, face only accounts receivable that cannot be turned into liquid assets during economic downturns. The financial industry, also due to the stagnation of capital use, cannot but engage in contraction, leading to a further tightening of the market, and the decline of industry and commerce becomes more apparent. The Shanghai Banking Association Joint Reserve Committee, recognizing this, proposed the organization of a bill acceptance house last March and April to add a credit instrument to the financial market and seek the flexibility of funds. At that time, discussions were held several times, but due to various reasons, it could not be realized immediately. This year, the association believed that the promotion of acceptance business could not be delayed any longer, and recently, in accordance with the resolution of the Shanghai Banking Association, it organized the Bank Draft Acceptance House to handle the draft acceptance business among banking colleagues, formulating seven chapters and thirty-three articles.

<p>Believes National Banks Must First Provide Low-Interest Loans</p>
<p>Otherwise, There is Risk of Capital Flight from Various Banks and Firms</p>
<p>The Silver and Banking Industries Associations have been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to properly discuss reducing deposit and loan interest rates. The Banking Association has formed a subcommittee to study the matter, and the Silver Industry Association has entrusted the Executive Committee to study it. Both have now drafted measures and will soon consult with each other and report to the Ministry of Finance. According to the New Voice News Agency, the measures proposed by the Silver and Banking Industries Associations share the same opinions. They both believe that to reduce loan interest rates, national banks must first provide low-interest loans to their counterparts. Regarding reducing deposit interest rates, they believe that serious consideration should be given, otherwise, there is a risk of capital flight from various banks and firms. As it stands, the highest deposit interest rate for various banks and firms is no more than 1% per annum, while investing in bonds yields 1% per month.</p>

<h3 id="e107">The Three Goodness Societies: Joint Deliberation on Condolences and Support for Sun Yinting <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>A few days ago, Chang Hui of the Shanghai Goods Relief Association for Earthquake Victims, along with Standing Committee members of various provincial Water Disaster Relief Associations, Zhu Qinglan, Wang Zhen, Qu Yingguang, Huang Qinglan, Cheng Jingsheng, Quan Shaowu, etc., after a meeting, specifically extended the time to propose that the reported suicide by drowning of relief worker Sun Yinting was deeply saddening. Relief colleagues planned to collect funds to assist the surviving family. A resolution was made: first, the Shanghai Water Disaster Relief Associations of various provinces, the Chinese Relief Society, and the Shanghai Taiwanese Disaster Relief Fund Management Committee, these three organizations, would send telegrams of condolence to the family and concurrently provide substantial assistance to help the family's living expenses. During the meeting, Cheng Jingsheng first reported on Sun's brief history. Sun Yinting, named Hongxiu, was from Baoying County, Jiangsu Province, and was almost fifty years old. He graduated from normal school, and although his classical Chinese wasn't great, he was very capable. Accounting and auditing were his strengths. He was particularly meticulous, and extremely responsible in his work. In the early years of the Republic of China, he worked as a staff member in the tax bureau under Wu Jingshan in Zhejiang, then followed Wu in disaster relief, enduring hardship and being both disciplined and excellent. Later, he worked under Liu Qusheng, Chen Borong, Qiao Mengqian, and others for the Shanghai Relief Association and the Shanghai Temporary Relief Association, traveling to various counties in Henan, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other provinces for disaster relief inspections. He was kind-hearted, unafraid of hardship and danger, diligent in his duties, and honestly self-disciplined, refusing remuneration, which was respected by various charitable organizations. When Mr. Feng Menghua was in charge of the Shanghai Relief Association, he greatly appreciated him, so his reputation was quite prominent. He was commissioned to supervise the construction of the West Lake Villa for Hardoon Foreign Firm and went to Jiangxi to assist in tax affairs. At that time, he already felt economic hardship, speaking out frankly, a reversal of his former silence. He re-entered the Chinese Relief Society as a member, again handled Zhejiang relief efforts and river works, and the Taiwan disaster relief association hired him to manage the Ninghai project, achieving remarkable results, which was praised by the local community. During the 1931 flood, he was appointed as the inspection head for Funing and Xinghua by the National Government's Relief Committee for Water Disasters, the Jiangsu Provincial Relief Committee, the Shanghai fundraising for various provincial water disaster relief associations, and the Jiangsu Relief Association. He was overly eager to do things well, and he firmly refused any remuneration for disaster relief work. Even if colleagues occasionally gave assistance, he would be constantly concerned about it. After a long time of fulfilling obligations, his family's situation became increasingly difficult, and he suffered mental stress. Last year, he suddenly discussed with friends in Shanghai the possibility of trying to cultivate land west of Baoying Lake, hoping to solve his livelihood. The original plan did not meet expectations. He borrowed three to several thousand yuan from friends and returned home, but he did not listen to advice to seek another way of life, still reluctantly carrying out cultivation. In winter, the borrowed funds were insufficient, and he again sought help from others. This spring, building embankments in the reclamation area required a large amount of money. He came to Shanghai to visit friends and borrow money again. On the eighth of this month, he met them at the Grand Cathay Hotel, and he still looked calm, showing letters from friends advising him not to devote himself to reclamation, which may not be successful and may cause trouble. He said that his luck was bad and did not blame the reclamation land. He asked for help in borrowing money for consolidation. Jingsheng told him that the amount was too large and difficult to raise quickly, willing to give him some time to make plans. He thanked him and left, but unexpectedly, three days later, a newspaper had this shocking news. Mr. Feng Yangshan said that Mrs. Wu had also received a suicide note, stating briefly that the reclamation attempt had failed and that he had no choice but to end his life to apologize to friends. It is feared that it is already a tragic outcome, and there is deep sorrow. It is noted that his family has a wife, four young sons, and a daughter, all young and needing to be raised. It is proposed to ask colleagues to contribute generously. Next, Qu Yingguang spoke, saying that Mr. Sun was extremely sincere, and the various relief associations benefited greatly from his enthusiastic help. However, he had long been mentally disordered. When handling Taiwan relief, he demanded funds excessively. Although he was truly devoted to disaster relief, his awareness was too intense. That he would end up like this is painful. Colleagues should do their best to help. It was fitting to meet Mr. Feng Yangshan of the Chinese Relief Society who also had this intention and was very saddened. The three organizations should unite, and relief colleagues should take on the responsibility of raising condolence money separately. As for the body, having been thrown into the sea, it is impossible to retrieve. Then, the chairman Zhu Qinglan said that this gentleman was a good person, but inevitably stubborn. He had seen him several times before, and he certainly seemed to have a mental illness. It's a great pity. Wang Yiting said that a public appeal should be issued, and he could help first. Then, it was decided to raise money for condolences and also to request a commendation from the Central Relief Committee. Feng Yangshan and Cheng Jingsheng were publicly recommended to draft it.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Shanghai Land Bureau Announcement: Convenient Methods for Certificate Exchange <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Land Bureau, in view of the fact that people holding single tax receipts to the bureau for certificate exchange cases are difficult to handle due to discrepancies in the single tax amount and also due to missing tax registers, making verification impossible, the handling of the above cases is quite difficult. The bureau has formulated flexible measures and issued a notice. The announcement (No. 24) of the Shanghai Land Bureau is recorded below: In the case of this bureau handling certificate exchange, the authenticity of the old tax receipts submitted by the people is reviewed, and the tax receipts submitted are checked to see if they correspond to the tax paid by the holder. If the single tax amount does not match, the certificate exchange will be hindered. Furthermore, there are cases where the tax registers presented in the register are carelessly stored, resulting in missing pages and sections, making it difficult to determine. If all certificate exchanges are not granted, then the land tax receipts held by the people are all evidence of property rights, and they will inevitably be disappointed. Moreover, in cases where the single tax amount does not match, the people have no way to adjust it themselves, and in cases where the tax register is missing, even if a thorough investigation is conducted, the previous tax registers and registers are regarded as private property and sold repeatedly, resulting in no basis for verification, and the matter is evaded. The bureau has difficulty in handling the above cases and has no fixed method to follow. Now, in order to facilitate certificate exchange, flexible measures are formulated and submitted to the municipal government for approval. All certificate exchange cases of the people, such as those where the tax register is missing and cannot be verified, or where the single tax amount does not match, but it is confirmed that they actually own the land, can be handled accordingly. The relevant measures are announced to the people of the city for their information. Specifically, the following are listed: Measures for collecting evidence for certificate exchange in cases where the tax register is missing or the single tax amount does not match: 1. The applicant must prove that they own the land in question. The method of proving it shall be to submit legal evidence of ownership. 2. In addition to submitting the evidence in the first item, if the land is leased, a lease agreement and lease tax must be submitted; if there are houses built on it, in addition to submitting a lease agreement and lease tax, a house tax receipt or construction permit must also be submitted. 3. For self-cultivated land or self-occupied houses, if the various evidences specified in the second item cannot be submitted, a guarantee shall be issued by two landowners with land certificates, or two reputable stores, or a joint guarantee from four neighbors. March 14, 25th year of the Republic of China, Cai Zengji, acting director.</p>

<p>The Shangchuan Transportation Co., Ltd., in order to develop the transportation between Shanghai, Chuansha, and Nanhui, has specifically expanded and built the Chuan-Zhu section of the Nanchuan County Road. This section has now been completed and a traffic opening ceremony was held yesterday. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Guests Attending: Those who attended yesterday went to Qingongtang in three groups. The first group departed from the Bund on Beijing Road by the city ferry to Qingning Temple at 9:00 AM, and then transferred to the company's special car. The second and third groups arrived at 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM respectively. There were a total of over eight hundred people, including representatives from the Nanhui County Party Headquarters Chen Shunping, the Chuansha County Party Headquarters Lu Shunqing, the Nanhui County Mayor Yuan Xiluo, and gentry, schools, institutions, and organizations from Chuannan. The company was represented by Chairman Qu ShaoYi, Manager Gu Bowei, and Gu Shuwei, among others. The presidium was composed of Yuan Xiluo, Qu ShaoYi, and Gu Bowei.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony Circumstances</p>
<p>The opening ceremony was held as planned. First, Chairman Yuan Xiluo reported, stating briefly that today is the opening ceremony of the Chuan-Zhu section of the Nanchuan County Road of the Shangchuan Company. From now on, the transportation between Shanghai, Chuansha, and Nanhui will be more convenient, which is enough for the people of the three counties to rejoice. It was decided that the land foundation used by the Shangchuan Company was leased from the Nanhui County Government. In July of the 23rd year, the company, together with the Nanhui County Government, sent personnel to measure it. In December, it was approved by the Jiangsu Construction Department. On June 15th of the 24th year, the Nanhui County Government followed the contract to build the earthworks, which was completed in November, costing over 10,000 yuan in earthwork expenses and over 1,000 yuan in seedling subsidies. At the beginning of the road construction, the villagers had some misunderstandings. Thanks to the Nanhui and Chuansha County Party Committee members who organized a propaganda team to publicize to the people, there is today's success. This point should be thanked to the members of the two county party committees. In addition, there is a report that the farmland used for the road construction will be issued with a corresponding price starting from the first of next month.</p>
<p>Board Report</p>
<p>Subsequently, the chairman of the company, Qu ShaoYi, reported, stating briefly that our company was initiated in the 10th year of the Republic of China, and formally established in April of the 13th year, renting the county road to lay railway tracks and actively carrying out the work. On October 7th of the 14th year, a road rental and operation contract was signed. On the 8th of that month, the Qingning Temple to Gongjialu section was completed and opened to traffic. In January of the 15th year, the company, in order to extend the route, increased its capital by 150,000 yuan, combining with the old shares to a total of 300,000 yuan, building roads and laying tracks, continuing to work. In July of the same year, the Gongjialu to Sizhaogang section was completed, and the Shangchuan Road was fully opened to traffic. In June of the 18th year, the company's assets increased, and another 100,000 yuan of capital was raised, actively operating, leading to today. In the future, it is planned to extend the route to Fengxian, directly reaching the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway.</p>
<p>Manager's Report</p>
<p>Subsequently, the manager of the company, Gu Bowei, reported on the company's operations, stating briefly that when our company first opened to traffic, there was only one black oil electric locomotive, two Ford locomotives, and five passenger cars. Later, as the number of passengers increased, we added one black oil locomotive and one oil electric locomotive each, and four passenger cars, and the business became more prosperous. Later, because these locomotives were too slow, the company, in order to improve, ordered three steam locomotives and six large passenger car chassis from Germany in October of the 19th year. In order to ensure traffic safety, we rebuilt wooden bridges into steel bridges in the 20th year. In September of the 22nd year, steam locomotives began to run. On May 15th of the 23rd year, the company ordered the lease and construction of the Chuanqin County Road from the Chuansha County Government, starting from Sizhao outside the north gate of Chuansha to the boundary of Qingongtang Nanhui County, a total of four kilometers. The Chuansha County Government was responsible for building the earthworks, while the company built steel bridges. The railway tracks were laid in October, and the entire line was opened to traffic on November 20th. When the Chuanqin Line was in progress, because the end point of this line was adjacent to the Nanhui border, if it were to connect with the Nanchuan County Road of Nanhui County in the future, the transportation of Shangnan and Chuan would be more convenient, and various businesses could obtain considerable development. Thanks to the support of all parties and local people in Nanhui, after several negotiations, a contract was signed with the Nanhui County Government in the shortest time to undertake the construction of the Nanchuan County Road and connect the tracks to traffic. In July of the 23rd year, the Nanhui County Government, together with the company, sent personnel to measure the road line. In December, it was approved by the Construction Department. On June 15th of the 24th year, the Nanhui County Government followed the contract to build the earthworks, focusing on the Chuan-Zhu section first, which was completed in November. The company immediately built steel bridges and laid railway tracks, which was completed last month. Therefore, the traffic opening ceremony is held today. Subsequently, Chen Songping, representative of the Nanhui County Party Committee, and Lu Shunqing, representative of the Chuansha County Party Committee, delivered speeches successively. At 1:00 PM, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Test Ride Circumstances</p>
<p>At 1:00 PM, the company's "opening ceremony special car," amidst military music and firecrackers, was opened for traffic by Mrs. Yuan cutting the ribbon. It arrived at Jiangzhen at around 1:20 PM and was suddenly blocked. The reporter got out of the car to observe and saw a white small flag in front, horizontally blocking the road, with the words "Jiangzhen People Request to Repave the Ballad Street" written on it. The reporter asked the residents of the town, who claimed that the Chuan-Zhu railway was passing directly through Jiangzhen Street, which was very inconvenient for pedestrians, so this request was made. Subsequently, the chairman of the company, Qu ShaoYi, discussed with the town mayor of the town. Because the company's road foundation was leased from the Nanhui County Government and had nothing to do with the company, the town mayor found a way to allow passage. After passing through Dengzhen and reaching Zhuqiao, all the guests got off the bus and were treated to lunch by the company. At 4:00 PM, the special car returned to Qingning Temple and boarded the city ferry back to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Central Savings Society: Officially Opens Today <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Central Savings Society, specially licensed by the National Government, has been allocated a fund of 5 million yuan by the Central Trust Bureau. The society's accounting is completely independent, and it has hired prominent financial figures in the country: Chen Xing, Li Ming, Chen Guangfu, Song Hanzhang, Qin Runqing, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Guo Bingwen, and Guo Shun, as members of the Supervisory Committee to supervise the use of savings and ensure the safety of depositors' interests. The manager of the society is Mr. Li Shuming, and the deputy managers are Zhu Shikang and Zhang Xisan. All old savings certificates of the Sino-French Savings Society that have been taken over can be exchanged for new certificates of the Central Savings Society after the opening. Today, the society officially starts business at No. 126 Hankou Road in this city. The Supervisory Committee will also convene its first meeting to discuss the matters in progress. It is also heard that the Minister of Finance, Kong Xiangxi, will also attend the meeting to give instructions. As for the savings offered by the society, there are various preferential measures for depositors. The main points of its articles of association are explained as follows: 1. The Society issues savings certificates with a face value of 2,000 yuan for the whole society, with a monthly saving of 12 yuan; 1,000 yuan for the half society, with a monthly saving of 6 yuan; 500 yuan for the quarter society, with a monthly saving of 3 yuan, until the face value is fully paid within 14 years. 2. Depositors who prepay savings for half a year can deduct 1 yuan per whole society, and those who prepay for one year can deduct 4 yuan. 3. The society holds a lottery draw every month, for a total of 180 draws within 15 years. In the last year, depositors do not need to pay savings but are still included in the lottery, with the hope of winning. 4. The calculation of the special prize amount is based on the number. It is 50,000 yuan when the number reaches 100,000. If it is less than 100,000, it will increase or decrease according to the certificate number. However, if it is less than 50,000, the prize money will be at least 29,000 yuan, and the difference will be supplemented by the society. 5. In addition to the special prize, every 2,000 certificates have a first prize of 2,000 yuan, a second prize of 300 yuan, a third prize of 200 yuan, and a fourth prize of 100 yuan, each one. Every 10 numbers have a last prize of 12 yuan, and there is also an additional prize. 6. When a depositor withdraws from the society midway, they can fully recover according to the withdrawal table. 7. Depositors can borrow from the society at any time after paying for two years. 8. Depositors who have paid in full can receive a full principal amount in addition to sharing a bonus. 9. The Society allocates half of the surplus from the income of the savings after deducting reserve funds to the bonus fund, generating compound interest. The bonuses that depositors who withdraw from the society midway do not issue as per the rules are also included in the interest accrual, so the bonus received by depositors when they have paid in full is exceptionally generous. 10. The Society's use of savings is handled in accordance with the safe methods stipulated in the articles of association, and it is reviewed by the supervisory committee. 11. During the lottery, it is handled under the supervision of the directors and supervisors of the Central Trust Bureau, the members of the Supervisory Committee of the Society, the auditing accountant, and the representatives of the depositors. (A detailed article of association is available upon request.)</p>

<h3 id="e114">China Flying Society: Sixth Sightseeing Flight <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Held Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The China Flying Society, in order to promote the aviation interest of Chinese people, held sightseeing flights. After holding the first flight on the first of this month, it has already held five consecutive flights. However, they were all held during the severe spring cold with wind and rain, and the aerial flights were inevitably slightly less interesting. In recent days, the weather has cleared up, and a gentle breeze has blown, and it has entered the warm spring atmosphere. Sightseeing flights are extremely suitable. Therefore, the society held its sixth non-flight at Longhua Flying Port again yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, as usual. In addition to the members Wang Boshu, Wang Zefu, Jiang Raobo, Zhao Weiwen, Shang Liangchai, Jin Youfang, Liu Pusheng, Wang Rongshu, Guan Jiming, Zhang Deqing, Xu Qikang, Zhang Guanhai, Lu Zhongkang, Liu Yinghua, Cai Hanzhang, Chen Renyan, and Wu Zhonghong, the female aviator Ms. Li Xiaqing has also joined the society as a member and participated in the flight. It is heard that because the weather is warm and fine now, Chinese people like to take advantage of the season to go on spring outings in groups. However, their actions are mostly close to passive sightseeing. In order to enable Chinese people to appreciate the great nature on the ground and experience three-dimensional scenery and to encourage young people to move towards the emerging aerial sports path, with the purpose of promoting aviation, the society has decided to extend the time of the sightseeing flights. Anyone who is willing to participate can still register at the society's office at Lubanfang, Luban Road. It is also heard that the society's flight class is actively preparing, and it will be able to open the class in early May. However, there are not many places in the first class, and members who are interested in participating should register early to avoid missing out.</p>

<p>Bai Yuanlong and Others Were Arrested by the Detective Team</p>
<p>Confessed to Rape and Conspiracy to Abduct</p>
<p>Peng Zhuang, a 19-year-old young woman from Chongming, had been living in her husband's family in her hometown. Last month, when she returned to her parents' home, because she was by nature frivolous and restless, she was found out by her mother and scolded slightly. Peng Zhuangran away from home in a huff, and came to Shanghai alone on the twelfth day of the old calendar in February, intending to go to the Public Concession Sima Road to look for her husband's uncle, Peng Xiangbao. Unexpectedly, when she arrived at the entrance of the Huiguan Lane in Nanshi, she suddenly met Bai Yuanlong, a fellow villager, who saw that she was alone and could be deceived. So he went forward to strike up a conversation with her, coaxing her with sweet words to the Fumin Hotel in Nanshi, opening rooms No. 8 and 9, and raping her continuously for five days. Then, because the travel expenses were huge, he colluded with his friend Lu Zitao, and led her to Lu's place (No. 31 Hongqiao Lane, Nanshi) to stay. She was then raped by Lu for four days. Later, he planned to design to marry her to Lu's younger brother as a wife. However, because the conditions of both sides were not in agreement, Peng was led back to the Xinrongkang Hotel on Waimalu, Shiliupu, by Bai again the day before yesterday, and opened room No. 22, and continued to rape her. The matter was learned by the Shiliupu Detective Squad.

<h3 id="e119">Yihua Dance Troupe Lost Money: "Tears of Remorse" Film Mortgage Involved in Lawsuit <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Hu Zhipei, a local resident, twenty-seven years old, residing at No. 85 Cihou Lane, An'nan Road, recently retained attorney Pan Renxi to file a criminal complaint in the Second Special Court against Yang Jinsheng for two counts of fraud and breach of trust. The main points of the complaint stated that the plaintiff organized the Yihua Dance Troupe in December last year and went to Suzhou, Shengze, Jiaxing, Pinghu and other ports to perform. As a result, business was sluggish and losses were quite heavy. The defendant, Yang Jinsheng, is the manager of the Shengze Grand Theater in Shengze Town. When going to various places to perform, the defendant introduced the troupe, resulting in a large accumulation of travel and meal expenses, which could not be paid. All of these expenses were advanced by the defendant. On January 8, the plaintiff settled accounts with the defendant at the Huifang Tea House on Wuma Road in the British Concession of Shanghai. The defendant advanced a total of twenty-eight yuan for the company. At that time, the plaintiff was unable to repay the amount and discussed with the defendant and agreed to convert the advance payment into a loan. The plaintiff used the recently produced "Tears of Remorse" film from the plaintiff's Zhaohua Film Company as collateral, specifying that the term of the mortgage loan was three months, during which the plaintiff could redeem the loan at any time. However, if the term expired and the loan was not redeemed, the defendant had the right to screen the film and use the proceeds to offset the principal and interest of the loan. However, the defendant should obtain the plaintiff's consent before screening the film in any theater. Unexpectedly, after the plaintiff prepared funds to redeem the loan, the defendant avoided meeting with the plaintiff. Moreover, the defendant dared to screen the film privately at the Fu'an Company, Xianshi Company, and Daqian World without obtaining the plaintiff's consent, renaming it "Tears of Remorse Shadow." When the plaintiff learned of this and protested, the defendant ignored the protest. The plaintiff requested that the defendant be investigated and prosecuted according to law. The defendant was summoned the day before yesterday afternoon. First, the plaintiff's attorney stated the previous circumstances and said that the plaintiff intended to redeem the film and send it to the Jin Cheng and other major theaters for screening. Now, the defendant sent it to a recreational ground for screening, which caused the film's value to decrease. When questioned, the defendant Yang Jinsheng claimed that the plaintiff had repeatedly delayed redemption, so he had no choice but to send it to various recreational grounds for screening in accordance with the provisions of the contract. However, the quality of the "Tears of Remorse" film was poor, and the screening was blurred and unclear, which was not welcomed by the audience. It was estimated that the Fu'an Company only screened it for one day, charging seven yuan and ten cents. The Xianshi Company charged forty yuan, and the Daqian World charged fifty yuan. The amount received was not enough to offset the debt. The merchant had declared to the guarantor Wang Weiqing during the screening, and Wang could testify in court. The attorney defended everything on behalf of the defendant. Witness Wang Weiqing testified that Yang Jinsheng did tell the merchant that the film was sent to the recreational ground for screening. Judge Zhang ordered the case to be adjourned for sentencing on the 19th.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Tao Longshun, a Can Manufacturer in Pudong, Was Twice Intimidated by Gangs <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>First, a Thief Was Arrested Who Claimed the Victim Was His Brother-in-Law</p>
<p>Then Three Accomplices Were Arrested and Sent to the Bureau for Interrogation</p>
<p>Tao Jinze, a Pudong resident, fifty-two years old, residing at No. 30 Tianbao Branch Road, Zhabei, operates the Tao Longshun Can Factory. The business is doing quite well. He was targeted by bandits. On the afternoon of the fifteenth of last month, at about 6 PM, a thug named Yan Shifu, leading three people, broke into Tao's bedroom, brandishing a handgun, and warned him not to make a sound. They demanded that he hand over two thousand dollars within three days, otherwise they would use the handgun. They then dispersed. After Tao received this alarming message, he immediately reported to the Linping Road Police Station in the Fifth District to request an arrest. The police station dispatched detective Zhang Liangjin to investigate. Unexpectedly, at 2 PM the day before yesterday, Tao was passing by the door of the Yangtie Store Quan Genhu on Tianshi Road in a car. Suddenly, Yan Shifu, leading many people, ambushed in the store, rushed out and stopped Tao's car, snatching a small Luzon wool hat (valued at sixteen yuan). At the same time, two thugs threw a bucket of urine and feces at Tao, splashing it all over his body. Yan Shifu shouted, "Today I'm sending you a message. If there is no reply within three days, I will shoot you dead." Tao again reported to the Detective Corps of the Public Security Bureau and the Linping Road Police Station, requesting that they be wanted. Then, at 5 PM on the same afternoon, a fellow villager, Yao Xiaomao, visited Tao Jinze's home. After talking, he told Tao that he had seen Yan Shifu, Lu Guirong, Xiao Fusheng, and Quan Genhu secretly discussing in a small inn near Linping Road, fearing that there would be further severe actions. Tao Jinze reported to the Detective Corps Chief Ji Yuanpu of the Public Security Bureau, who immediately dispatched the Ximen Squad Leader Li Xiaobao, leading detectives Liu Wenwen, Jin Yushan, etc., to No. 37 Zhenxiu Lane, Yangjiadu, Pudong, at about 4 AM yesterday. Yan Shifu was still sleeping and had not gotten up. When he knew that the detectives had arrived, he hid under the bed, but was eventually dragged out and arrested. He was taken to the Ximen Branch Bureau. Under interrogation, he confessed, "Tao Jinze is my brother-in-law. I threatened him with a handgun because of business issues, not to extort two thousand yuan. My accomplices Lu Guirong, Ni Fusheng, and Hua Fuquan are now at the Baoxing Hotel." The case handlers then went to the hotel and arrested Lu Guirong, Ni Fusheng (Xiao Fusheng), and Hua Fuquan (Hu Quan), three people. After interrogation at the bureau, the case was deemed to be a major case of extortion, so a document was prepared and sent to the General Bureau for reception.</p>

<p>Gao Yonglian Pays Fifteen Yuan per Month</p>
<p>Gao Shizhi, a deceased comprador of Taikoo Dockyard and a native of Chaozhou, resided at No. 10, Lane 177, Luban Road in the French Concession. Gao engaged in a wide range of businesses during his lifetime. His eldest son Gao Yonglian inherited his position as comprador of Taikoo Dockyard. Gao Yonglian was recently sued by his stepmother Gao Bao through attorney Ma Leming in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court for neglecting her livelihood, seeking a judgment ordering the defendant Gao Yonglian to pay sixty yuan per month, amounting to ten years of living expenses. Gao Yonglian himself was summoned to court for verification. The parties arrived in court on time the day before yesterday. First, the plaintiff's attorney stated the previous circumstances. When questioned, the defendant Gao Yonglian stated that his stepmother was cohabiting with a merchant and that all her food and drink were provided by the merchant, so there was no reason to pay her living expenses. The plaintiff claimed that although she had food to eat, she had no vegetables and still needed money for other expenses. At this point, the judge repeatedly advised both parties, and the defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff fifteen yuan per month. Both parties agreed, and a settlement was reached. A written settlement record was made in court and signed before they left.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Report of the Guangdong-Guangxi Industrial Survey Team (3): The Hardworking Guangzhou Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>On the first day of arriving in Guangzhou, I visited Director Feng Rui of the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry and had a long conversation. Director Feng graduated from the Department of Agriculture at Cornell University and has been working in Ding County, Zhili, as an agricultural expert with great abilities. He first led the survey team to visit the entire bureau. The bureau has an agricultural tool exhibition hall, an industrial testing institute, and a serum manufacturing institute, all of which are excellent. Director Feng said that the province's second phase of economic construction plan is currently being planned, and it is intended to focus on agriculture, such as rice improvement, sugarcane field promotion, aquaculture, animal husbandry, fruit tree propagation, and sideline promotion. After the early rice improvement, the yield can be increased by 25%. Pig, chicken, and duck farming are all starting with improved breeds and increased production. For beekeeping, it is hoped that 5 million beekeeping households will be promoted this year, one hive per household. Sugarcane field management: 15,000 mu are directly managed, and 120,000 mu are contracted sugarcane fields, which can currently meet the needs of the province's six major sugar factories. Director Feng personally went to the Philippines and Java to investigate and research the improvement of sugarcane varieties, bringing back varieties and testing them with good results. Aquaculture focuses on fish diseases and breeding manufacturing, and rice paddy carp farming is strongly promoted. Animal husbandry and veterinary medicine are also training talents and conducting research. Director Feng showed us the recently proposed plan to reduce the province's import surplus, enrich people's lives, and greatly increase production, such as the food production increase plan, the agricultural and animal disease prevention plan, the animal husbandry development plan, the forestry construction plan, the production increase plan, the aquaculture improvement plan, the fruit tree development plan, the tobacco industry revitalization plan, the tea industry development plan, the agricultural irrigation revitalization plan, the new agricultural tool manufacturing plan, the provincial pest control plan, and the wasteland reclamation plan, all with very detailed explanations and estimates. Director Feng gave us numerical instructions when explaining. Before leaving, he gave us many pamphlets. He is a true hardworking person, and we are all impressed. In the evening, Commander-in-Chief Chen Bonan also said in his speech that agriculture is the foundation of industry and commerce. If the countryside is not prosperous and farmers do not have abundant productivity to promote their purchasing power, then urban industry and commerce will never have prosperity. Guangdong Province's hard work today is for a reason.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Strongman at Fu'an Amusement Park Advertises: "Hitting to Death Is Not Compensated" <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Huang Shigong Was Fooled into Working as a Substitute and Was Hit Until He Vomited Blood</p>
<p>Relatives Learned of This and Went to Investigate, and Both Parties Were Arrested. Huang Shigong, a native of Anhui, thirty-one years old, residing at No. 8, Linjiazhai, Gaochang Temple, and his brother Hongsheng both made a living by sculpting "clay figures." Shigong was strong and powerful, but illiterate. Recently, as life became more difficult, Wang Zhiqing, a strongman from the Xia Ying Martial Arts Troupe at the Fu'an Amusement Park, recruited troupe members to perform fighting ferocious cattle. Huang Shigong was introduced into the troupe. Unexpectedly, Wang Zhiqing advertised widely in newspapers: "Full body 螜螜 kung fu, head, chest, waist, and lower four parts. Please invite the audience to come on stage and test it in person. Hitting to death will not be compensated. This venue is responsible for guaranteeing it." "This venue has a contract of life and death with the strongman." Since Huang Shigong joined the troupe, it has been six days. In Wang Zhiqing's advertisement, the performance of inviting the audience to come on stage to hit him was done by Huang Shigong as a substitute. The day before yesterday, because no audience came on stage, Wang Ruipeng, a strongman from the troupe, hit Huang Shigong more than forty times with an iron plate, causing Huang to be injured and vomit blood. His uncle Zhang Yongqing learned of this. After reviewing the newspapers, he realized that his nephew Huang Shigong had been fooled by Wang Zhiqing. If he was beaten to death, wouldn't he have died in vain? There was an advertisement as proof. Therefore, at 8 PM last night, he gathered Huang's brother Hongsheng and others and went to the Fu'an Amusement Park to ask Wang Zhiqing and the venue manager Bao Qinxuan to read the cattle death contract. Bao replied that this was a game, so an argument broke out, and then a fight broke out.

They are currently under investigation. If mediation fails, they will be sent to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

It has been in business for more than forty years. Its Pine Crane and Fortune brands have long been popular throughout the country. The reason why it can enjoy this reputation is because the materials are carefully selected, and tobacco leaves that have not been stored for more than ten years are not used. Therefore, the tobacco tastes mellow and fragrant, and it is worthy of being the first choice of domestic products. Recently, a new type of five-piece Berlin brand has been launched, which has a mellow and strong taste, far superior to imported products, and the decoration is beautiful, making it very suitable for sending gifts to guests. Moreover, the price is low, and the value is several times different from imported products.

<p>Adopting a Policy of Solidifying Reserves as a Business Strategy</p>
<p>Currency Reform Strengthens Foreign Exchange Business</p>
<p>Handling Rural Loans Progresses Smoothly</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank held a board meeting yesterday to report on past business and future business strategies. The following details the bank's 1935 business overview and service overview.</p>
<p>Business Overview The bank's business policy for this year, in light of the adverse environment, has consistently focused on solidifying reserves. Indeed, the primary duty of a bank serving society is to protect the interests of its depositors. Given the unstable financial market this year, and to further strengthen the protection of depositors, the bank has sought to increase its cash reserves. Consequently, it has been necessary to moderately restrict assistance to industrial and commercial enterprises compared to times of peace. At the end of this year, the total loan and cash reserve balance is as stated in the current balance sheet, totaling over 130 million yuan. This includes over 57.7 million yuan in current deposits, over 42.6 million yuan in fixed deposits, and over 31.5 million yuan in savings deposits. All figures are lower than at the end of 1934, due to financial panic this year, with extreme anxiety among the public, which was reflected in deposit withdrawals, almost as a matter of course. Simultaneously, enterprise deposits experienced significant withdrawals as companies sought to meet their own needs due to market tension. Furthermore, to maintain sound operations in recent years, more than ten branches, offices, and agencies have been closed, which has also reduced deposits. Therefore, deposits have generally declined throughout the year, only ceasing after currency reform and then showing a trend of increase. At the end of this year, the total cash reserve was over 40.16 million yuan, an increase over the previous year. At the end of the previous year, the cash-to-deposit ratio was 21%, while at the end of this year it was 30%. Since the bank's business policy this year has focused on solidifying reserves, and the bank's loans have always been liquid, it has been easy to recover them despite the poor market conditions. The amount of loan repayments exceeds the amount of deposit decreases, and cash reserves have also increased accordingly. Loans and Investments At the end of this year, the total balance of loans, securities purchases, and real estate investments was over 120 million yuan, also a decrease from the previous year. This is a necessary step in solidifying reserves. Furthermore, stable industrial and commercial enterprises, aware of the adverse environment, are unwilling to make significant progress. The need for bank loans is not very strong. Activity only increased after currency reform. The total loan balance is over 100.2 million yuan, of which collateral loans account for 75%, credit loans account for 20%, and bills and discounts account for 5%. Among the collateral loans, commodity collateral accounts for more than half, followed by securities and factory collateral. The composition is similar to that of the previous year. The percentage of credit loans appears higher than in the previous year because the total loan amount in the previous year included securities purchases and real estate investments, while this year it does not. Therefore, the percentage appears higher, but in absolute terms, it is actually a 25% decrease from the previous year. Restrictions are very strict, and loans are only granted to customers with assured repayment, to protect the security of funds. In terms of investments, securities purchases at the end of this year were over 16 million yuan, and their book value is still lower than the market value. Real estate investments are mostly used for the bank's business and warehouse purposes. Accumulated depreciation has been applied in previous years, and the balance at the end of this year is over 8 million yuan. Profit and Distribution The total net profit for the year was over 844,400 yuan. The distribution method was resolved at the board meetings on July 26, 1935, and January 15, 1936, as follows:</p>
<p>A. Net profit for the year 844,939.63 yuan</p>
<p>Plus retained earnings from last year 3,018.01 yuan</p>
<p>Total 875,957.64 yuan</p>
<p>B. Distribution resolved by the board of directors in two phases:</p>
<p>1. Appropriation for public bonds 100,000.00 yuan</p>
<p>2. Payment of shareholder dividends at 5% 100,000.00 yuan 410,000.00 yuan</p>
<p>and a bonus of 4%</p>
<p>410,000.00 yuan</p>
<p>3. Appropriation for dividend reserve 50,000.00 yuan</p>
<p>4. Appropriation for remuneration for directors and supervisors 10,000.00 yuan</p>
<p>5. Appropriation for remuneration for general and deputy general manager-level employees 200,000.00 yuan</p>
<p>Balance carried forward to the next period 65,957.00 yuan</p>
<p>Total 875,957.64 yuan Loan contraction this year reduced interest income compared to the previous year, but exchange gains increased due to foreign exchange arbitrage and increased documentary bills. All expenses, amortizations, and write-offs are shown in the profit and loss statement, similar to the previous year. Write-offs are strictly handled to ensure the accuracy of assets. Reserves In this year, 100,000 yuan was appropriated for public reserve, and another 50,000 yuan was appropriated for dividend reserve in order to balance future dividend payments. The current public reserve totals 5.2 million yuan, and the operating reserve has increased to 2.3 million yuan. Including the dividend reserve, the total is 7.55 million yuan, exceeding the capital by 2.55 million yuan, further ensuring the interests of shareholders and depositors. Increase and Decrease of Branches Given the adverse environment this year, and for the sake of centralized management and sound operations, branches, offices, or agencies with mediocre performance have been temporarily closed. These include Qingdao Jiaozhou, Beiping Nancheng, Shandong Weixian, Jiangsu Chenjiagang, Qintong, Danyang, Anhui Chuzhou, Datong, and Wuhe, Hubei Yuejiakou and Shayang, Henan Zhumadian Zhangde and Lingbao, Hebei Shijiazhuang, and fifteen other locations. Those established to meet business needs include the Anhui Hefei Office, the Beiping Xicheng Office (relocated from the Nancheng Office), and the Wuchang Wangshanmen Office. Those reorganized include the Jiangxi Province-managed line, which was moved from Jiujiang to the Desheng Road Office in Nanchang; the Guangrunmen Nanchang Branch, which was changed to the Guangrunmen Office; the former Jiujiang-managed line, which was changed to the Jiujiang Branch; the Liyang Agency, which had good business and was expanded into an office; and the Yichang Branch, which was changed to an office due to changes in the business environment. All of these measures are intended to improve business convenience. Overview of Savings Department Business At the end of this year, the total savings deposit balance was over 31.5 million yuan, of which current savings deposits were over 20.9 million yuan, a decrease from the previous year, and fixed savings deposits were over 10.5 million yuan, an increase from the previous year. This year, to meet the needs of depositors, three types of savings were added: fixed deposit lump sum withdrawal, fixed deposit installment payment, and deposit principal interest payment. At the end of this year, the total loan balance was over 21 million yuan, and the total amount of securities purchased was over 6.6 million yuan. The content of loans and investments complies with the Savings Bank Law. The current public reserve of the department is 600,000 yuan, which also exceeds the capital of 100,000 yuan. Overview of International Department Business Foreign exchange fluctuations were not drastic this year, and the department's operations were more cautious. Various businesses have made progress, and to encourage China's export trade, efforts have been made to promote export documentary bills. Since currency reform, foreign exchange has stabilized, and the department's operating risks have been reduced accordingly. The department's foreign currency reserves are increasing, and the business foundation can be considered solid. Overview of Trust Department Business This year, the department applied to the government to be established as a specialized department, allocating an additional capital of 500,000 yuan. Accounting is independent of the business department. This year, business focused on safekeeping valuables and deeds for customers, acting as an agent for receiving and paying funds, providing guarantees for customers, providing insurance for customers, and managing real estate affairs. Progress is smooth.</p>
<p>Service Overview</p>
<p>This year, the bank adopted a policy of solidifying reserves as its business strategy, and has not been able to actively promote assistance to industry, commerce, and agriculture. However, it continues to provide assistance to stable production enterprises within a safe range, and continues to facilitate the turnover of ordinary people's finances. Assistance to National Industry From January to October this year, currency continued to contract, and the market became increasingly depressed. Various industries struggled to maintain turnover, and many reduced production and cut expenses to survive. Since currency reform, inventory prices have risen, and sales have improved. Various factories have benefited, especially those that use domestic raw materials, such as silk factories, oil factories, and some yarn factories and flour mills. This year, loans to national industries totaled over 33.75 million yuan, a decrease of over 3.3 million yuan from the previous year, due to loan contraction. The content of the loans can be analyzed as follows: Among the loans, the largest decrease compared to the previous year was in loans to yarn factories, reaching over 3 million yuan, followed by dyeing and weaving factories, which decreased by over 400,000 yuan. The rest were similar to the previous year. Collateral accounted for over 90% of the loans, focusing on the pledge of bulk commodities. For large-amount collateral loans, cooperation with other banks was still used to diversify loan risk. Efforts were also continued to promote management and technology. The most gratifying phenomenon this year is that the operating efficiency of various factories has generally increased in the depressed environment. The cost of each bale of cotton yarn in yarn factories is not inferior to that of excellent foreign factories in China. If they can continue to innovate, and at the same time, local security and diplomacy are worry-free, then national industries can be expected to make progress in the future. Assistance to the Rural Economy The bank has been providing rural loans for more than four years. Although the task is arduous, it is difficult to say that the bank has made significant contributions. Fortunately, the staff went deep into the countryside and worked tirelessly to maintain a steady progress in the adverse environment. Although disasters occurred one after another, cotton production was relatively abundant, and agricultural exports were relatively active, and prices were relatively stable. Therefore, rural loans increased compared to the previous year. The total loan amount for the year was over 6.08 million yuan, an increase of over 1.5 million yuan compared to the previous year. The loan area is distributed in Shanghai and Nanjing, and in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong, Shanxi, Guangdong, Henan, Shanxi, Hubei, Hunan, and ten other provinces, in a total of 70 counties. There are over 900 cooperatives and warehouses that have borrowed from the bank, and 200,000 farmers have financial relationships with the bank. The types of loans can be summarized as follows: (A) Production and sales loans: This type of loan is provided to cooperatives and farmers for production or transportation and sales, with crops as collateral. The term is short and greatly benefits the financial turnover of farmers. It has always been the main business of the bank's agricultural loans. This year, a total of over 3.7 million yuan was lent out. The important crops used as collateral are cotton in Shaanxi, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu, silk and tobacco in Shandong, sugarcane in Guangdong, and tea, wheat, and tobacco in Anhui. (B) Credit loans: This type of loan is granted to credit cooperatives for production improvement, and is distributed in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, and Shandong provinces. Each credit cooperative has been thoroughly investigated and deemed to have sound organization and reliable guarantees before loans are granted. This year, credit loans totaling over 460,000 yuan were granted. (C) Warehouse agricultural product pledge loans: This type of pledge loan is undertaken by cooperative warehouses, special warehouses, or directly by the bank. The pledge loan made this year was 1.8 million yuan. (D) Other loans: There is a type of loan called "ox club loans." The so-called ox club is a collective organization for the purpose of preserving draft cattle. Loans are provided for production purposes, with draft cattle as collateral. This was piloted in Jiangning, Jiangpu, and Yicheng this year, with good results. A total of over 110,000 yuan was lent out during the year, and all have been repaid upon maturity. Many of the loans granted this year were jointly granted with other banks, and were handled very smoothly. Since the bank is providing rural relief from the perspective of a commercial bank, its scope cannot be too broad. If it can work together with other banks, it can not only eliminate unnecessary competition, but also achieve greater results. Assistance to Civilian Finance The Jing'an Temple Road branch of the bank has been providing small credit loans for five years, and has been handled with great care. The results have been very good over the years. This year, even in the environment of financial panic, it has still made a considerable contribution. At the end of this year, the loan balance was over 499,000 yuan, similar to the end of the previous year. The number of borrowers was over 6,980, which is double the number of the previous year. The reasons for borrowing and the types of borrowers are similar to those of the previous year. In total, the number of borrowers since the establishment of the program has reached over 15,000, indicating that the service does meet the needs of the general public. What is particularly gratifying is that the amount of bad debt is very small, less than 5/10,000th of the total loan amount. Each loan is not a large amount, and there are reliable guarantors. Loans are only granted after a thorough investigation, which is quite stable and reliable for bank operations. This year, in order to reduce the interest burden on borrowers, the original interest rate of 7.5% per month was reduced to 6% per month. However, for those who overdue on repayments, a late fee of 5 jiao is charged to encourage borrowers to repay on time.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Tung Wah Plays with Nine Men - Loses 1-3 to French Club - Li Ning, Li Yichen, and Zhou Guangzhong Injured - French Club's Performance Mediocre, Victory Not Glorious <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Tung Wah and French Club football teams both hold prominent positions in the Western Union Group A League. Yesterday's meeting at the Recreation Ground was crucial for the championship outcome, so both sides acted cautiously and fielded their strongest lineups. Unexpectedly, disaster struck Tung Wah with an unfortunate major sacrifice. Li Mi, Li Yichen, and Zhou Guangzhong were successively injured and left the field. In the end, they fought with only nine men. Their hopes turned into frustration. The five thousand spectators also lost their spirit. Both Li Ning and Li Yichen were injured, one in the wrist and one in the forehead. It is feared that they will not recover in the short term. The match ended in a miserable 1-3 defeat.</p>
<p>Three Generals Injured</p>
<p>In the first five minutes, the battle was unusually fierce. The extremely rapid and brilliant performance earned enthusiastic praise from the audience. Unexpectedly, at this moment, Li Ning lost his footing while saving a ball, fell and injured his wrist severely, and left the field. Tung Wah felt the pain of losing a main player, but continued to attack. The momentum was still strong. But after half an hour, Li Yichen (the original inside defender) headed the ball. At the same time, French Club center forward Robertsdorf rushed up and kicked the ball with his foot, hitting Li's forehead and brow. Tung Wah lost these two main players and has since failed. In the tenth minute of the second half, Zhou Guangzhong was also injured in the foot and left the field. From then on, it became a one-sided situation.</p>
<p>Lucky Victory</p>
<p>The French Club had won eight games in a row, but yesterday's performance was mediocre. In the face of Tung Wah's defeat, there was no special development. The talent was very good, but there were many shortcomings in the connection. The French Club was disturbed by Tung Wah's generals, revealing an uneasy look. The forward was also scattered and disorganized. The three goals were not scored with a clean kick. It only shows a lucky victory.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Situation</p>
<p>After Li Ning was injured, Mai Youliang scored a goal for Tung Wah, and the situation was extremely exciting. Tung Wah did not reduce its fighting power due to Li Ning's injury. Tung Wah occupied the advantage for 20 minutes before being cleverly passed by French Club right winger Walter, and Robertsdorf scored a diagonal shot, creating a tie. After that, Li Yichen was injured, and Tung Wah continued to struggle. The French Club was still helpless. Until the 40th minute, Jaimie Walter scored another goal, and the first half ended 2-1. Afterwards, Tung Wah fought like a trapped beast. Everyone doubled their efforts and ran the entire field, shouldering the double responsibility of offense and defense. After all, the strength was weak, and the response was not timely. The French Club center forward scored another goal. The French Club showed a scattered and weak posture everywhere. From then on, they could no longer increase the number of goals. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Three Defaults</p>
<p>Yesterday in Group A, in addition to the Tung Wah vs. French Club game, and the Portuguese team's prior announcement of default against You You, there were two more defaults. Western Merchants vs. Western Police, the Western Police defaulted. Lancashire vs. Jewish, the Jewish team defaulted. The remaining game was Rax, who won 5-1 against Shahall. Such a large number of defaults will reduce the interest of the league in the future. The current situation of Group A is as follows:</p>

<p>Western Union Football Club Group B League, You You B vs. British Navy, played at the Shenyuan Football Field on Yan'an Road at 2 pm yesterday. You You B is very strong. In the Group B Cup, they have been invincible. Yesterday's victory against the British Navy was expected. The British Navy has been practicing very hard recently, and their performance has improved sharply. Last week, they defeated Tung Wah B by 3-2. However, compared with You You, they are still inferior. Yesterday, You You used a large number of new players. They took the lead with a 1-0 lead in the first half with skillful cooperation. In the second half, the British army was determined to avenge themselves and attacked fiercely. Fortunately, You You's defense was tight and they were not attacked. In the end, each had no achievements. As a result, You You won by one goal.</p>

<p>Western Union Football Club Group C League, Qinghua vs. Russian Army, competed at the Recreation Ground at 2 pm yesterday. Qinghua, taking advantage of the remaining power of defeating the Huapu with a 5-1 victory the day before, could have destroyed the Russian army in one fell swoop. Who knows, the enemy army was unusually tenacious. In the first half, the entire army joined forces to attack, and took the lead by a score of 1. In the second half, Qinghua changed its strategy, and the game changed. Ge Xizuo scored a goal, creating a tie.</p>

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>In summary, today's status and reputation of our boy scouts are due to the promotion and planning of the China Boy Scout General Association, so we should support the General Association. The rapid advancement of the Shanghai Boy Scout cause relies on the guidance of the Shanghai Municipal Council, so we must support the Council. Now that the people are calling for national salvation, our boy scouts must first save themselves by "striving for the soundness of their knowledge, morality, and physique" in order to truly implement national salvation.</p>
<p>Luo Lie's Speech</p>
<p>In summary, when the Boy Scouts were first established in our country, they simply imitated others and had no goals of their own. It was not until they were led by the Kuomintang that they took the implementation of the Three Principles of the People and the preparation for the revival of the nation as their own responsibility. Therefore, the current Boy Scouts have a very important responsibility. We must do practical work for national salvation and survival. At present, we must diligently study all required courses and prepare to fight for the nation in the future.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3 id="e157">The Core of Reducing Interest Rates <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Youpei</p>
<p>Currently, the issue of low interest rates is being jointly studied by the government and commercial organizations. Both the banking and financial industries have separately formed subcommittees to discuss ways to reduce interest rates. What has been the result? All we hear about are records of actions, but we never see any concrete implementation measures. The reason for this hesitant research is not simply due to the "great importance of the matter," but is actually due to practical difficulties.</p>
<p>A low interest rate era in general economic terms signifies two things: one is that it indicates that the economy is in a process of decline, and the other is that it indicates the early stages of economic recovery. It can also be said that low interest rates are a kind of stepping stone from an era of economic decline to an era of economic recovery. The level of interest rates is nothing more than the general situation of supply and demand. Therefore, low interest rates indicate that the need for capital is decreasing at that time, and all economic activities are contracting. From 1860 to the outbreak of the Great War, the highest unemployment rates for British workers were in 1879, 1886, and 1909, with unemployment percentages of 11%, 10%, and 8%, respectively. The Bank of England's rediscount rates during these years averaged 2.5% in 1879, 3% in 1886, and 3.25% in 1909. This example can prove that low interest rates and increased unemployment rates are in an inverse proportion.</p>
<p>However, this indication of low interest rates is significantly different from the current economic situation in China. The former explains that low interest rates move along with the socio-economic state, while the latter wants to use this path to achieve the goal of economic recovery.</p>
<p>According to the statistics of the Iron Industry Monthly, the average interest rates in Shanghai during the panic over the past six years are as follows: 7 fen per thousand yuan daily interest in the 19th year, 1 jiao 3 fen in the 20th year, 8 fen in the 21st year, 6 fen in the 22nd year, 6 fen in the 23rd year, and 1 jiao 4 fen in the 24th year. The year with the highest interest rate was also the year with the most profound panic. This fact is the exact opposite of the example given above. The low interest rates in the UK indicate economic decline, while in our country, it is the opposite. The reason is that the UK is a suzerain state, their financial organization is sound, and various industries have many colonies as their outlet. Therefore, what they feel in economic decline is overproduction and stagnant capital. Our country is a semi-colonial economic country, with unsound industrial and financial organizations, and general capital is not necessarily used for production. Therefore, the most difficult thing felt during a panic is credit contraction. In the UK during that period, factories were resting, and there was no need for capital operation, so interest rates were low. In our country during this period, due to credit contraction, industrial and commercial operators needed capital assistance but found it difficult to achieve their goals, so interest rates rose. Therefore, in terms of this issue, if we reduce interest rates in our country to seek economic recovery, this principle is correct.</p>
<p>The capital of production enterprises mostly relies on the use of loans. The level of loan interest rates is also the level of production costs. Therefore, a low interest rate policy is sufficient to reduce production costs and promote the progress of production enterprises.</p>
<p>The reason why the market interest rate in our country is so high is due to the abnormal development of cities and the fact that funds are not created through proper use. Since the extreme expansion of urban finance, funds have been accumulated without a way out, so most of them tend to take the path of speculation. The easiest examples to cite are real estate, public bonds, bid money, and goods. The generous profits of this kind of speculation are all higher than those of general industry and commerce, which is a manifestation of the expansion of urban finance. That is, the increase in the number of banks in recent years, and the interest obtained from regular industrial and commercial lending, is naturally not as high as that of speculation, so they all abandon this and take that. At the same time, in order to increase their profits, banks have to use high interest rates to absorb deposits as their speculative capital. The Shanghai market is declining every year, the national economy is declining every year, and the profits of the banking industry have always stood in an invincible position. With the changes of the times and the gradual contraction of credit, urban real estate prices have fallen with the economic downturn, and a large number of speculators have felt the pain of credit freeze. Due to the deepening of credit, there have also been bank runs, which have shaken the foundation of banks. Their only way out is still to use high interest rate methods to absorb deposits to strengthen their foundation. Real estate has fallen, but other speculative policies are still emerging endlessly. Why should banks "not follow this path"? It is really difficult for industrialists and merchants to hope for a turnover of funds.</p>
<p>And what about the rural areas? Due to the outflow of funds, the drop in the price of agricultural products, and the frequent occurrence of natural and man-made disasters, there is a great lack of payment chips. Funds have been concentrated in cities, and it is difficult for the drop in the price of agricultural products and poor harvests to bring back funds. Where do farmers get funds in this difficult situation? According to the survey of the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute, the largest percentage of farmers' loan sources is rich farmers, followed by merchants and landlords, and cooperatives account for only 1%. Since there are no formal financial institutions, it is of course an ideal to hope for fair interest rates. Farmers who ask for loans can only struggle under usury.</p>
<p>Usury is a fact in our country, and it is also a fact that it harms industry and agriculture. Then, of course, it cannot be said that it is unreasonable to demand low interest rates, but there are still many practical problems.</p>
<p>In his article "From Bank Interest Rates to Interest Rate Reduction" published in this newspaper, Mr. Sheng Kezhong stated his views on reducing interest rates and proposed a hypothetical highest and lowest standard interest rate, which is 6% for both ordinary and savings one-year deposits, and 5% to 7% monthly interest for loans. Mr. Sheng believes that the source of industrial and commercial loans is banks, and the interest rate on deposits is actually the cost of the bank's loan interest rate, so we should first seek a reduction in deposit interest. According to the interest rates he set, compared with advanced countries, it is obviously still much higher.</p>
<p>Now, from the bank's point of view, there are many difficulties in reducing interest rates. The most obvious is that there are many high-interest investments ahead, and there is no need to find a way out for loans, which cannot be corrected. Taking public bonds as an example, since the government unified them, the interest rate has been reduced somewhat, but no matter what, it is always above 8%, and its stability is also above that of general investments.</p>
<p>Bank capital is also a kind of cost, and the interest rate of this cost is the dividend. The usual dividend interest rate is 6% to 8%. If you want to reduce interest rates, in addition to reducing the interest on deposits, you must also consider the dividend. Dividends can certainly be reduced, but bank stocks, which originally did not occupy any position in commercial securities, may be devalued as a result.</p>
<p>The escape of capital is also a matter of concern. Have we not seen foreign banks revise their deposit news? The announcement in the newspaper stated that the interest rate was reduced, but in fact, not only was the interest rate not reduced, but it was still increased. Haven't we heard of foreign banks refusing to accept deposits? Haven't we heard of foreign banks not giving interest on deposits and giving them "free deposits"? The current revision of interest rates has actually become an increase. This is a matter that should be paid attention to in the promotion of low interest rates. Although it is said that the Chinese people have made great progress in common sense recently, and they no longer trust foreign banks as much as before, after the currency reform, it is common to see the general bourgeoisie purchasing and storing foreign currency, purchasing and storing foreign goods, and hoarding gold bars. Then, once the interest rate is reduced, there is not much difference between Chinese banks and foreign banks for many depositors. Why not abandon this and take that?</p>
<p>The social situation in China is different from that in other countries. The form of feudal society has not been completely abandoned, so it is not surprising that the high interest rate in the folk is as high as 100% in poor and remote areas. Although the reduction of interest rates can be uniformly reduced in urban banks, it is impossible to prevent usury in the folk. In fact, this kind of folk usury has a greater impact on the national economy than that of urban usury. It is still possible to obtain funds by means of usury in cities, but in rural areas, even if they are willing to bear high interest rates, they still have the pain of not being able to obtain them!</p>
<p>The pain suffered by the industrial circles in our country is actually the problem of not being able to obtain funds, not the problem of high or low interest rates! It is a fact that the industrial circles need capital assistance, and it would be even better if they could borrow at low interest rates. But now, in a frozen situation, suppose that the industrial circles still cannot get the convenience of using funds under low interest rates, what kind of measures will be adopted? Therefore, the biggest pain suffered by the industrial circles in our country at present is how to fundamentally solve the problem of credit freeze, not the problem of mere interest rates.</p>
<p>The banking industry is unwilling to engage in regular investment and does not provide funds to industry and commerce because of the generous profits of speculative business or semi-speculative trading. Therefore, to make investment go to the regular road, it is necessary to first strictly crack down on speculation and reduce debt interest. As for the way out for the industrial circles, it lies in expanding the scope of securities and opening up commercial securities, creating a long-term capital turnover market for industry and commerce. There is no need to rely solely on the banks.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for the formation of folk usury is that our country's financial institutions pay too much attention to the urban international commodity market and neglect the rural areas. Therefore, the universal establishment of rural financial institutions is also an indispensable thing. It is the responsibility of everyone to communicate the finance of the city and the village.</p>
<p>In short, the implementation of low interest rates is beneficial to the whole country, but from the standpoint of today's economic situation, if we say that interest rate reduction is the only way out for industry and commerce, and it is the realization of economic recovery, it is too simple.</p>
<p>After this article was written, I saw the Bank Association's subcommittee issue two opinions on interest rate reduction: (1) Request the government to reduce the interest rate on public bonds, and (2) Request the central bank to reveal low interest rates. (Shen Bao, February 27) Although this opinion did not explicitly state that low interest rates are not feasible, it does indicate the necessary conditions for low interest rates. We believe that low interest rates are an indication of the state of capital supply. If we want to obtain capital easing from low interest rates, under today's Chinese financial market, it is not only a practical difficulty, but also putting the cart before the horse. —February 27—.</p>
<h3 id="e158">On Capital Accumulation and Interest Rate Levels <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Xun</p>
<p>It is generally recognized that the excessive cost of capital is the core of the problem preventing the development of industry in our country. Therefore, creating a cheap capital market has become the goal of recent public and private efforts. It is generally believed that the implementation of a low interest rate policy should start with reducing the government's public debt interest. Since the government announced the method of unifying public debt, the interest rate is still 6%, and it has not been reduced in any way compared to before. It is generally argued that this is because the government's policy is not thorough enough. But we believe that the first issue that should be studied here is whether it is possible to artificially reduce interest rates?</p>
<p>The level of interest rates in a society is determined by various objective environments. However, broadly speaking, it mainly depends on two factors: supply and demand. In societies with abundant capital accumulation, the supply of capital is sufficient, and the elasticity is very large, so the level of interest rates is generally low, and seasonal changes are relatively insignificant. On the other hand, in economically backward countries with weak capital accumulation, the supply of capital is not very sufficient, and there is a lack of elastic flexibility, so the level of interest rates is generally high, and seasonal changes are very significant. From the demand side, in times of prosperity, prices rise, industry is active, and industrialists rise up to engage in activities, and the level of interest rates must be raised. In certain seasons, certain businesses are particularly active, which can also push up the level of interest rates, which is the so-called financial season. For example, if an investment in a certain local business is particularly profitable, such as real estate a few years ago, so that the activities of social capital tend to one path, the result can also raise the level of interest rates. The interest rates in a society are generally determined by the relationship between supply and demand. If the relationship between supply and demand does not change, and the interest rate is reduced by artificial methods, what will be the result? Those who own capital are unwilling to invest it, or even invest it in other places, and the supply of capital becomes increasingly reduced. The result will inevitably lead to a long-term economic decline, and we will never be able to keep up with others. Therefore, unnatural reduction of interest rates is an unhealthy means in economics.</p>
<p>Moreover, based on historical experience, artificially suppressing interest rates often fails to achieve the goal and becomes an ineffective effort. For example, if we reduce the public debt interest rate to 3%, the market price of public debt may fall to thirty-one or two yuan, but the result is still about one fen. If we raise the public debt interest rate to 8%, the market price of public debt may be as high as eighty-four or five yuan, but the result is still about one fen interest. Therefore, before other environments have changed, the market price of public debt will rise and fall on its own to adapt to the interest rate and meet a certain standard interest rate. Simply raising or lowering the public debt interest rate will ultimately have no effect.</p>
<p>Based on the facts of the past and present, "one fen" seems to be the most common interest rate in the public debt market in our country, and 60 to 70 yuan will probably become the most common market price for public debt in our country. One fen interest may be a more natural interest rate in our country's capital market. Our country's capital accumulation is still in its infancy, and it is inevitable that capital will be more expensive. Because of this, we can encourage general capital accumulation, so that our capital accumulation can stand at the same level as other countries. Therefore, as long as our country's interest rate is not too different from that of other countries, it is harmless to be slightly higher, and it is also natural.</p>
<p>One fen interest is still too heavy from the standpoint of industry and commerce. For example, the material of a piece of foreign clothing is exactly the same as ours, but the interest cost they bear is only two jiao, while ours is more than one yuan. In this way, our products are obviously at a disadvantage in the market. Therefore, it is necessary to gradually suppress domestic interest rates to reach the international interest rate level. The second question we want to discuss is how can we achieve this goal?</p>
<p>Since the level of interest rates generally depends on the supply and demand of capital, we must design from these two aspects if we want to gradually reduce the level of interest rates in our country. If we can increase the supply of capital on the one hand and conserve the use of capital on the other, our goal can be gradually achieved. Therefore, under the premise of a low interest rate policy, we want to propose two points: one is to encourage capital accumulation, and the other is to control the use of capital.</p>
<p>Without accumulation, there is no capital. Capital comes from accumulation. A portion of what people get from production is not used for consumption, but is invested in production enterprises, so that it can be produced again. This is capital. Therefore, the meaning of capital is the re-production of production income. In economically developed societies, people's production efficiency is very high. There is more surplus in life, so the capital accumulation efficiency is also greater, the supply of capital is naturally more abundant, and the level of interest rates is also lower. On the other hand, in economically backward societies, people's productivity is very low, and what they earn in a day is not enough to support themselves. Naturally, there is no surplus for accumulation, and the level of interest rates cannot but be higher. Therefore, the interest rate problem is fundamentally a capital accumulation problem. And the biggest difficulty facing our country at present is the lack of production capital. The rise in interest rates is the result of a lack of production capital, not the cause. The problem we are facing at present is how to encourage capital accumulation. After this problem is solved, other problems will be solved accordingly. A slightly higher interest rate level is not a problem, and it is a way to encourage people's capital accumulation.</p>
<p>Secondly, controlling the use of capital is also a hand that must be adopted under the premise of a low interest rate policy. Capital is the basis of economic activity, and it can also be said to be the foothold for human survival. If the accumulated capital is not used for production enterprises, then not only will interest rates rise, but also human survival will become impossible. Therefore, how to control the use of capital has become a policy that must be adopted. However, because of the different eras, the degree of adoption is slightly different. The ancient people's interest in fishing and salt, and the development of mountain forests, are nothing more than a kind of control strategy for capital activities. For example, the so-called rationalization of industry a few years ago was nothing more than controlling the activities of capital to make the most efficient production. As for the recently popular controlled economy, analyzing the content is nothing more than strictly managing the direction of capital movement to meet the needs of the society and the country. In economically backward countries with weak capital, controlling the use of capital is a policy that must be adopted. If the activities of capital are allowed to be anarchic, then production becomes anarchic production, and the result is very dangerous. Non-productive businesses that divert the use of capital should be stopped. For example, real estate solidifies hundreds of millions of capital, but it has no direct production effect. This kind of business should be stopped from developing. Unhealthy industries often waste capital unnecessarily. Taoist industries should be urged to improve, so that capital can exert its productive effect. Hopeless industries freeze and delay the use of useful capital. These industries should be eliminated to avoid wasting useful capital in hopeless ways. For example, it should be forbidden to borrow debts for non-production purposes, and to rob production capital, so as to avoid using production capital for non-production purposes, or even for destruction of production expenditures. All capital should be used for production purposes, and all can be produced most efficiently. This is the policy we should adopt in the future. Only in this way can the ability of capital accumulation be increased, and the large-scale accumulation of capital is possible. Only after sufficient capital accumulation can the social interest rate level naturally decrease.</p>
<p>If the accumulation of capital in society does not increase, but only artificially lowers interest rates, it is abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the superficial, and it is unnatural. It is not only ineffective, but also harmful. We believe that the crux of the current industrial problem in our country is not that the interest rate level is too high, but that the accumulated capital is not enough to be applied, and that only some of the capital is wasted in non-production ways. The current way to rescue is to encourage capital accumulation and control the use of capital. It is useless to talk empty words about reducing interest rates without this plan.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Shanghai Real Estate in 1935 <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Jin</p>
<p>In 1933, Shanghai's real estate market, due to the influx of urban speculative capital and general speculative fervor, showed signs of gradual prosperity. The annual real estate transaction volume reached 43,136,000 yuan. Although this was a decrease of over 130 million yuan compared to the golden age before the "January 28th Incident" (i.e., 1931), it was an increase of over 18 million yuan compared to 1932. Undoubtedly, Shanghai's real estate market at that time did have a period of vigorous growth.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, by 1934, this glimmer of hope was extinguished. This is because real estate, after all, needs people to live in it to generate rent. This means that it is ultimately subject to the ups and downs of industry and commerce. And China's economy in 1934 was plagued by various ills, and Shanghai was no exception. The United States' silver purchase policy, which became popular in 1934 (especially in the second half of the year), made Shanghai, already suffering from financial inflation, feel the threat of tight credit and scarcity of funds. As a result, land prices plummeted and even became lifeless assets that no one cared about. Previously, silver firms that had been obsessed with "title deeds" suffered greatly at this time, and they all declared bankruptcy due to the inability to circulate huge amounts of real estate mortgages. As a result, the real estate relief problem became extremely serious!</p>
<p>In the spring of 1935, Shanghai real estate merchants, in order to extricate themselves from their predicament, proposed issuing 500 million yuan of real estate securities, using real estate as collateral, so that dead real estate could be revived and circulated. However, this resulted in failure. In August, they planned to establish a real estate exchange, hoping to revive real estate through auction floors, but this also resulted in failure! This is not surprising. When afflicted with a terminal illness, even Bian Que (a legendary doctor) could not bring one back to life! Sir Victor Sassoon, the British gentleman and real estate magnate of Shanghai, in order to fill the gaps in his coffers, also advocated the issuance of pound notes last spring to resist the encroachment of the silver policy and allow land prices to continue to rise. As a result, due to "unripe timing," it temporarily vanished like a bubble. However, Sir Sassoon's opinion was ultimately much stronger than that of Chinese real estate developers. It also had the air of an international currency war, and the British Royal Family would not take it lightly. Therefore, Ross came to China, and the pound note plan was largely realized through the new monetary system!</p>
<p>Of course, we are not saying that the new legal tender and pound notes are the same thing, but we are also unwilling to blindly deny the blood relationship between them. At the same time, we are not saying that Ross's instigation of the new monetary policy in China was entirely in response to Sir Sassoon's demands. We only believe that the policy also very effectively served Sir Sassoon's real estate! Because after the birth of the new legal tender, the Ministry of Finance could worry less about the suffering of depleted silver reserves and enjoy more freedom to issue banknotes. Not only could the fiscal figures be temporarily balanced, but general credit could also be eased. Wouldn't this allow real estate to take the opportunity to revive? Let's listen to the explanations of Arthur and Sopher! They wrote with a smile in the Shanghai Times:</p>
<p>"Regardless of whether the Chinese government will be able to support its new monetary policy in the future, assuming other conditions remain unchanged, the real estate market will develop upwards. Because if the new legal tender is successful, then abundant new legal tender and flexible credit will flow into the real estate sector to find profitable outlets. If the new legal tender fails, then real estate can also be revitalized through speculative transactions. Therefore, the timing for investing in real estate is indeed ripe!"</p>
<p>According to the facts, this is indeed the case. Before October, real estate transactions were very quiet. In June, the Puyi Real Estate Company even went bankrupt due to the decline in real estate. However, after November, the situation was very different. The transaction volume of real estate increased sharply, as detailed in the table below:</p>
<p>Shanghai Real Estate Transaction Volume Table for 1935 (Unit: Yuan)</p>
<p>From the previous table, we can immediately see that almost half of the annual transaction volume of over 14 million yuan belonged to the months of November and December. Therefore, looking at the whole year, although the transaction volume only increased by over 2 million yuan compared to 1934, and does not indicate any improvement in the real estate industry, from the perspective of the last two months, it does show significant vitality.</p>
<p>The sudden increase in real estate transaction volume in November and December is also related to the surge in remittances from overseas Chinese, but the latter is itself caused by the new legal tender. This is because the exchange rate of the new legal tender against foreign currencies was consistently lower than before, which increased the value of remittances from overseas Chinese when converted. According to the recent response from Li Daonan, Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Banks Association, to Sir Ross, the remittances from overseas Chinese in 1935 increased by 40% compared to the previous year (see the Hong Kong Industrial and Commercial Daily on February 19th). And due to the increasing decline of the domestic economy, most of these remittances were used to purchase real estate.</p>
<p>The promulgation of the new monetary policy, according to the Ministry of Finance's announcement at the time, was intended to revive industry and commerce. We will not discuss for the time being what kind of achievements have been made in this regard, but Shanghai's real estate industry has indeed been quite "revived." Sassoon, Hardoon, and general real estate owners will be deeply grateful, but from the perspective of the future of the national economy, this is extremely regrettable! It should be understood that after the rise of real estate, social funds have no longer paid attention to low-profit or even precarious industry and commerce!</p>
<p>There are two additional reasons why the real estate industry showed signs of a turnaround last year that must also be pointed out. The first is that the Shanghai Silver Industry Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce jointly launched a revision of the Mortgage Law, that is, if a real estate mortgage is not paid off upon maturity, the mortgagee can automatically sell it without having to first apply to the court for approval as in the past. The second is that the Ministry of Finance repeatedly ordered the China Construction Bank to establish a real estate mortgage bank to strengthen and expand the scope of real estate mortgages. Although these two things are still in progress, the force stimulating real estate to become active has already occurred. These two things are clearly instigated by silver firms and general real estate merchants. There is nothing wrong with this in itself, but they have forgotten the most fundamental problem and are abandoning the root to pursue the branch, which is really unforgivable.</p>
<p>In 1935, Shanghai's real estate market enjoyed considerable vitality thanks to the new monetary policy, but the entire national economy was still sinking in panic. This is a stark contrast that we should not forget! What right do we have to laugh with Sassoon! —Night of March 1, 1936</p>

<p>Last week, from March 9th to 14th, the public bond market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange suddenly encountered two major accidents at home and abroad. Market prices were precarious. Although there were several pullbacks, the overall trend was weak. Externally, the situation in Europe became increasingly tense. The pent-up resentment of many years erupted at once, which was more violent than any previous event. Therefore, it is impossible to temporarily declare stability at this moment. The issue of security concerning all countries in the world is extremely important. The situation in Germany and France is closely watched by the whole world. All industries related to the whole world are also shaken by it. Internally, the North China problem is still complex, and suddenly there are rumors of the Min Incident. Public bonds are in the midst of these two major crises. Without the establishment of an equalization committee, there would have been endless waves and it would be difficult to have the current situation of hovering,酝酿 and quiet transactions. The future situation, due to the increase in public bond chips, if the environment evolves slightly, then the changes will inevitably follow suit. For the time being, it is really not optimistic. Looking back on last week, on Monday, the German troops entered the demilitarized zone of the Rhine River, and the declaration of Hitler shocked the public bond market of the world. Our country's public bonds were no exception. The North Gang and No. 47 and others were sold in large quantities, and market prices fell back by 67 cents. On Tuesday, people were still uneasy. No. 16 and No. 47 continued to be sold and fell another 67 cents. On Wednesday, there were sudden rumors of the Min Incident. The North Gang and No. 43 were the most enthusiastic. No. 4 was also sold. Type B fell by 1.5 yuan, the largest drop, and the rest also fell by about 1 yuan. On the fourth day, the situation in France and Germany seemed to have hopes of easing, and the news of the Min Incident was dull. No. 4 took the opportunity to pull up the price. Type D returned to 1.2 yuan, and at least rose 6 cents. Transactions were the most on this day. On the ninth and sixth days of the week, the market was completely hovering and tired. The rise and fall were 23 cents, and it felt lifeless. The future is still a situation of酝酿 and waiting for change. As a result, market prices fell by several cents to 1.6 yuan. The total number of transactions totaled 25.17 million taels. The results of the rise and fall are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 taels).</p>

The sales market in this street was slightly more active, and the package demand was also smooth. Tianjin Yantai Office handled 1,4500 packages, so the market situation changed. If the thick early indica rice price returns to 5 cents to 1 jiao, the thin rice rises by more than 1 jiao. Du Yang tip carries nearly a jiao, yin bian yuan is average.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 40 ships arrived from various gangs downstream. The white indica rice market was dull in the early morning, and the price was short of several cents. The middle market turned active, and the price was shouted up by about 1 jiao. The evening market resulted in a fixed price. Early rice followed up by 67 cents, thin rice appetite moved slightly, and the price increased by nearly a foot. Yin yuan has a slight appetite, and the price is firm. Sheep Du Fu Xian rice prices are also strong, and the prices of other varieties are also strong.</p>

<p>— (Xiao Bai)</p>
<p>Fear is the greatest enemy of mankind. All so-called anxiety, worry, timidity, and panic are really manifestations of fear. It deprives people of happiness and weakens their abilities. It will make people increasingly cowardly and useless, and make them fail.</p>
<p>The evolution of society and the efforts of mankind, at present, in the progress of each of our undertakings, there is really no need for fear and procrastination. We must know that the only way to obtain a way out and seek light is to catch up, actively prepare and enrich ourselves, do not hesitate, do not wait and see, and exert the greatest strength.</p>
<p>So we can say: "Procrastination is the culprit of bad things, and fear is the destroyer of all human facts." Every minute of procrastination really makes things more difficult, and every minute of fear makes people lose a greater possibility of realization.</p>
<p>"To do, do it immediately!" I would like everyone to embrace this motto of successful people.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Wu the Coppersmith <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Su</p>
<p>Wu the coppersmith, a native of Jiangxi. In his youth, he was open-minded and unrestrained, flaunted his ambition to the world, and did not care about fame and fortune. He was strong and often wrestled with the children in his village, all of whom were defeated by him. Next to his house were two stone dumbbells. He lifted them with both arms, and the two dumbbells rose up without any sign of weakness. His neighbor was the residence of a certain magistrate, whose power and influence were dazzling and unparalleled. Whenever he went out, he would raise flags and umbrellas, and his servants would be like clouds. When Wu saw this, he cursed: "Why do you flaunt yourself like this! You are arrogant because of your official position. What is an official? An official is a servant of the people. Even the emperor cannot go beyond this. My ambition is not to be an official." His peers laughed at him, calling him a madman. Before long, the magistrate injured someone with his sedan chair. The wife of the injured person sought compensation, but he refused and flogged her, driving her away. Wu raised his arms and shouted: "The person who injured someone should be punished. If you are a magistrate, can you violate the law! I should kill you!" His parents had always disapproved of him, seeing him as a domineering little boy who was incorrigible, and they secretly intended to drive him away. The next day, the magistrate's office heard of an assassin, and Wu disappeared without a trace. Wu and the former Governor Zhang Xun of the capital were sworn brothers. When Xun controlled the Huai River with his army, those who sold titles swarmed around him like ants, and some tried to persuade him to advance. Wu was angry and said: "Wealth and honor are not my wish. Even though Xun is my sworn brother, since he is so prominent, how can I bend my knees and fawn on him because of poverty and lowliness?" When Wu moved to Zhenjiang, he became a coppersmith, and was therefore called Wu the coppersmith. And people also called him Wu the coppersmith, and forgot his name. Wu was happy and enjoyed it, and was not humiliated in his heart. When Xun passed through Zhenjiang, he visited his hut and wanted to entrust him with an official position, but Wu resolutely refused, saying: "I did not want to be an official when I was young. An official is a servant of the people, and it is only to suffer oneself. If one cares about the people, then one is too tired. If one does not care about the people, then one's heart is guilty and restless. Why not wander in the market and live in seclusion?" Wu had a rough understanding of writing and could also write simple letters. His speech was bold and healthy. His hut was no more than dozens of steps away from my house, but I only recently learned about him. Now he is still working as a coppersmith, which is his old ambition.</p>

<p>I went to the interior for some trivial matters. Although the journey was not far, there were no trains or cars on that road. Although there were boats, they traveled at an unexpectedly slow pace. Therefore, even using the only fast means of transportation, the eighteenth-century-style wheelbarrow, I could not arrive that day.</p>
<p>In the weather of February, at about five o'clock, the sun had already hidden below the horizon. Following the advice of my only travel companion, the wheelbarrow driver, to avoid encountering thugs on the way, I stayed at an inn recommended by the driver.</p>
<p>According to the driver, this inn was the only inn on this road where "officials and merchants" stayed. But this inn, rather than being called an inn, was better described as a farmhouse. There was no signboard, just a faded red paper strip stuck on the door, with the barely recognizable four characters "Lishang Inn" written on it. The house was a row of three rooms with a thatched roof and mud walls. The middle room was the hall, which, in addition to a broken wooden table and broken long benches, also had a loom. The owner's bedroom was at the head, and the front of the lower room was the inn, and the back was the kitchen.</p>

<p>The landlady was just under forty years old, and she also wore rouge and powder on her face. Seeing that a lodger had arrived, she busily swept away the chicken droppings and garbage in the client area, and was busy preparing dinner. The ready-made dishes were salted fish and egg soup. The boss never spoke. When he saw that I was about to finish eating, he put on his shoes and went out. As he was leaving, the driver greeted him, "Boss, going to make a fortune?" The boss didn't say anything. The landlady muttered, "Damn it, one day he'll lose his wife to someone."</p>
<p>At eight o'clock, I had just gotten into bed, and the landlady brought in a pot of tea, saying with a smile, "The guest is sleeping so early, is it because you feel lonely?" I quickly said, "No, it's just that I've been traveling all day and I'm tired." Then, the landlady and the driver were talking and laughing outside. I lay there with my eyes open until ten o'clock, coughed, and the landlady came in again, asking me what was wrong. I pretended to snore and ignored her. After eleven o'clock, the fire outside went out, and I finally felt relieved to close my eyes.</p>
<p>The next morning, I was woken up by the crowing of chickens. I hurriedly washed my face, settled the bill, didn't have breakfast, and urged the driver to set off. As the driver lifted the handlebars of the wheelbarrow, I vaguely heard the landlady, standing at the door, sighing deeply.</p>

<p>Shi Lian smiled: "This is not to discuss any problems, nor is it to ask Mr. Cheng for any help. This is just that we have a little intention to contribute to your husband. Whether your husband listens or not is just a word, and there is no other trouble." Zhiqian was even more confused. In a good mood, why would they contribute any opinions? He smiled and nodded twice, saying: "Your husband is too polite. How can I bear the word 'contribute'?" Li Shi Lian pondered for a while, then smiled: "It's not that there are any opinions to contribute to Mr. Cheng, but that there is a little intention to contribute to Brother Wang Beihai." Hearing this, Zhiqian couldn't help but feel a move in his heart, so he said: "What is that thing? He is just a poor student and doesn't talk much about socializing." Li Shi Lian smiled: "Does Mr. Cheng not know about this matter? To tell you the truth, it's Mr. Jia Duocai, who is the most lively in Little Western Paradise these two days. He wants to buy a large piece of land." Zhiqian hurriedly smiled: "I understand, this piece of land, Beihai is one of the representatives of the seller. Mr. Jia is asking him to reduce the price, right?" Shi Lian saw a cigarette on the table, took one and smoked it. After taking two puffs, he used three fingers to flick the ashes to the side twice, first smiled, then raised his right heel, pressed his toes on the ground, and bounced himself up for a while. Only then did he smile: "Mr. Jia, because of that Miss Zhu, has been so busy these days that he can hardly stand in Little Western Paradise. He has his own legitimate business, and cannot delay the big event for a joke. Therefore, he has quietly moved out at noon today. He wrote a note and handed it to me, stating that the marriage of men and women will not be related to each other in the future." As he spoke, he groped in his pocket for a while, took out a folded piece of paper, and handed it to Zhiqian with both hands to show him. He shook his hands, leaned back, and said: "Matters related to men and women, it is inconvenient for others to participate in this kind of secret." Li Shi Lian blushed and had to put the manuscript back into his pocket. But at this moment, Zhiqian recalled the meaning, so he smiled: "Mr. Wang will probably come to me soon. If Mr. Li is willing to wait here, I can introduce Beihai to talk to you." (415)</p>
<h3 id="e171">Spring Flowers Mocking People <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Manzi</p>
<p>In the late Ming Dynasty, Xu 　Zhi wrote to Du Gengshao, saying, "Life is but thirty-six thousand days, and spring only accounts for nine thousand. We, toiling souls, have already spent half of it. The east wind mocks us year after year." This year is even more prone to procrastination. The weather is so cold that there is not a hint of spring. Even the desire for timely enjoyment is held back.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I went to see a preview of "Spring Flowers" at the invitation of a friend. Firstly, the hot water heaters blocked the cold air outside the theater; secondly, the languid singing was full of the air of spring, and one almost forgot the "spring of winter."</p>
<p>However, this kind of spring atmosphere cannot last forever. After being battered by storms several times, by the time the music ended and the audience dispersed, a bleak and desolate feeling akin to autumn had descended, especially as the songs of "Spring Flowers" were sung in such different contexts and revealed themselves in the differences, giving me a profound sense of reflection. When I came out of the theater, the cold night air tightened its grip, and seeing the dim expressions on the faces of the people in the yard, I almost burst into tears.</p>
<p>Therefore, I feel that we must grasp the fleeting moment of youth with all our might. We must not be like Jinniang, unconscious and only loving vanity, blown to the west by the east wind and to the east by the west wind, ultimately becoming mud-stained catkins. It is a true waste and squandering of youth.</p>
<p>But then again, Jinniang's life has always been dominated by her environment, unable to control herself. How countless are the pitiable creatures in this world like Jinniang! If the women watching "Spring Flowers" can truly shed tears of sympathy, then the men should also awaken a little and not be like Sun Shanwu and his ilk, taking pleasure in toying with women. One must know that harming others harms oneself. The law of cause and effect may still exist today, or perhaps it is even sanctioned by science?</p>
<p>Spring flowers bloom and fade so easily, how should we cherish and care for them? "Of the ninety days of spring, half have already passed. Do not let the east wind laugh at us!"</p>

<h3 id="e172">Epitaph of Sun Chuanfang <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Binglin of Yuhang</p>
<p>Your name was Chuanfang, courtesy name Xin Yuan. You were a native of Tai'an, Shandong. As a young man, you were selected as a student of the Beiyang Military Academy and sent to the Japanese Military Academy. You joined the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance. You were highly regarded by your fellow students, Zhu Tengyue, Li Genyuan, and Zhao Hengti. The Alliance's mission was to protect the nation and resist foreign invaders. You upheld this for ten years without wavering. When you governed Jiangsu, Shi Congbin led six thousand White Russians from Jinan to fight. You defeated them at Guzhen, capturing Shi Congbin and the White Russian chieftain Nie Qia Yefu, whom you immediately executed as a warning, saying, "I will not allow people to slaughter each other with foreigners." Later, forced by the Southern Army, you retreated to Jinan. You still commanded forty thousand soldiers. The consul stationed in Qingdao requested to assist in recovering lost territory with two divisions, vowing not to seek reward. The envoy came three times. You, mindful of the reasons for the downfall of the Song and Ming dynasties, firmly declined. You did not regret even after the defeat. It can be said that you did not break your promise to the Alliance. However, you were ultimately assassinated by Shi Congbin's daughter. While there may be much debate in the Confucian classics and laws about sons avenging their fathers, your execution of Shi Congbin was clearly a just punishment. You possessed a heroic and outstanding nature. In warfare, you were skilled at using few to control many. When speaking to people, your words flowed freely, and you could continue for an entire day. After graduating from the military academy and returning, you served as a training officer in the Beiyang Second Division, rising through the ranks to become the commander of the Sixth Regiment. In the third year of the Republic, the bandit Bai Lang Xuan rebelled in Henan, causing numerous defeats for the government troops. The court ordered a joint suppression by five provinces. The bandits traveled over a hundred miles a day, outstripping the pace of infantry and cavalry. You marched through heavy rain at double speed, attacking and annihilating their forces at Shangcheng. Bai Lang Xuan fled, and you became famous. You rose to the rank of division commander and served as the garrison commander of Pu Xian, Shi Yi, Xin Jia Pu, and Tong, as well as the Commander-in-Chief of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Subsequently, you served as the military governor of Fujian and Zhejiang, promoted to the inspector-general of Fujian and Zhejiang, appointed as a general of the army, and awarded the title of General Ke Wei. You commanded the military affairs of five provinces: Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Jiangxi. During your one year in Zhejiang and Jiangsu, you never increased taxes due to military expenses. You repaid over three million in old debts for Zhejiang and over nine million for Jiangsu. You saved Jiangsu fifty thousand a month in military expenses. You reorganized seven million in public debt and abolished over ten kinds of harsh taxes. Since the establishment of the Republic, no other general has been like you in terms of thrift and benefiting the people. Although you later suffered defeats, the people of Wu and Yue did not forget your virtue. Your defeat of Shi Congbin was at the request of the elders of Shandong, Huai, and Xu. At that time, the White Russians Nie Qia Yefu and Bukes Nie Jiafo were skilled at operating armored vehicles. Shi Congbin recommended them to the military governor Zhang Zongchang of Shandong, who formed an armored vehicle unit of five. He recruited six thousand White Russians to serve under them and led the Han army south. The White Russians killed, raped, and plundered day and night, and few in the Huai and Si regions were spared. You used twenty thousand soldiers to defend Guzhen. Before the battle, the people seized the opportunity to destroy the railroad tracks. When the enemy arrived, you deployed your troops to surround them on both flanks and used heavy artillery to meet them head-on. All the armored vehicles collapsed. The military vehicles behind them, three in a row, retreated and collided with each other, unable to stop. You then used both flanks to shoot at them from left and right, inflicting a great defeat. The people watching cheered and celebrated along the roads. You pursued and captured Shi Congbin and Nie Qia Yefu and brought them back. You released all the captured officers and soldiers, executing only the two. At that time, the people of Shandong asked to take advantage of the victory and descend on Jinan, but you did not agree. However, the White Russian army was abolished from then on. The world often praises you for these three things, but none was as fierce as your elimination of filth at Guzhen. Since the founding of the Republic, the Revolutionary Alliance had changed its name and merged and split numerous times, and those who were distant could not even recall their oaths. When the Southern Allied Army rose in Guangdong, it was originally a major branch of the Alliance, but it was far removed from the initial assembly. The later recruits were frivolous and disrespectful to the old comrades. After you defeated Shi Congbin, your power grew daily. You began to oversee the military affairs of five provinces. The people between Wu and Chu looked up to you as their leader. Guangdong was also tense, and they once sent an envoy to seek peace, unaware of your inherent integrity. You believed that Guangdong had embraced the evil schemes of communism and that the Red Russians Borodin and Galen were secretly in charge. We record your old righteousness. The Southern Army had already captured Hanyang. You rushed to save it, leading your troops out of Jiujiang and engaging in battle, but you were taken advantage of. Returning to Jiangning, you knew that the upper reaches could not be defended and reluctantly sought assistance from Zhang Zuolin. Zuolin sent Zongchang and Chu Yupu with a hundred thousand soldiers to aid. The troops were disorganized, and you were ultimately defeated. Jiangnan completely fell. Retreating north, you held out for half a year. You again crossed the Yangtze River with a lone army and won several victories. Your troops reached Longtan, but reinforcements did not arrive, and you retreated into Shandong. You built a defense at Dawenkou for Zongchang, spending over a million. You camped west of it, entrusting Zongchang to defend it himself. While the battle was raging, Dawenkou fell, and you turned your army around. Your rejection of the □□ consul: you quoted the words of former President Li, "It is better to be subjugated by our compatriots than to fall into the hands of foreign invaders," to inform Zuolin. Zuolin also listened to your words and ordered the troops to withdraw through Yuguan to Huanggu Village, where they were ambushed and killed by □□ assassins. The advantages and disadvantages of things cannot be predicted in advance, but you were able to use your will to make Zuolin understand the greater righteousness. It can be said that you loved people with virtue. After you disbanded your army, you fled to Shenyang and lived there for four years. When Japan invaded Shenyang, you returned to Tianjin, living in seclusion and devoting yourself to Buddhism. You never spoke of national affairs again for another four years. In the winter of the twenty-fourth year, while listening to a sermon at the Jushilin Temple, you encountered Shi Congbin's daughter, who shot you in the back, the bullet exiting through your chest, and you died. You were fifty-one years old. You were married to Madame Zhang, followed by Madame Zhou. You had four sons: Jia Zhen, Jia Jun, Jia Yu, and Jia Qin, and three daughters. In April of the following year, you were reburied in Tai'an. When you were alive, you once said to your son, "When I commanded troops, I shared their joys and hardships. I have never used a single arrow against a foreign country, and this is my regret." You also established many good policies. Because your great integrity was based entirely on the resolutions of the Revolutionary Alliance, and your children and subordinates did not fully understand, I have specially recorded your character and the origins of your aspirations and actions. The inscription reads:</p>
<p>Those brave warriors! Men of dragon-like talents! Descendants of Fusang! Though talented, they are not of our race! I would rather kill enemies to protect the people than seek aid to survive. Therefore, the highest punishments must be used, and military strategies must be followed. In this divided land, alas, there is no way to exert one's strength. In this chaotic world, there is no justice. Let misfortune come from the evil gate. Believing in the righteous path, even lying dead is not enough to express it.</p>
<p>Correction: In last week's "Mourning Zhu Biaoyun" article, the ending "Xianci Temple in Suzhou" was mistakenly written. It should be "San Xian Ci Alley in Suzhou." We hereby correct this.</p>

<p>The Road to Health</p>
<h3 id="e173">Causes of Excessive Phlegm <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Dai De</p>
<p>Phlegm is a secretion of the lungs. When the trachea has inflammatory symptoms, secretion increases, resulting in increased phlegm and frequent coughing. Therefore, if the lungs are healthy, phlegm will be minimal; conversely, it is a sign of lung disease.</p>
<p>Excessive phlegm often originates from colds and is most likely to induce ailments such as pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumonia. Therefore, whether it is a cold with coughing, phlegm and wheezing in the elderly, it is imperative to seek a radical cure promptly. According to my clinical experience, the German "Bu Fei Na Er" (Lung Tonic) is the most effective. It is an unparalleled remedy for all kinds of chronic bronchitis and whooping cough in children. It also fortifies deficiency, congeals blood, and replenishes blood. In the first, second, and third stages of pulmonary tuberculosis, it is invariably miraculous. This medicine is made from hormones and lecithin of turtle, bear, and deer liver, lung, pancreas, and organs. Therefore, it can also be used to quit smoking and to effectively treat smoker's cough. It has strong tonic power and pure ingredients. Regular use can also moisturize the skin, prevent tuberculosis, and improve health. However, when purchasing, be sure to identify the "Bu Fei Na Er" poster to avoid misidentification.</p>

<p>The vigor of the reproductive power of both sexes depends entirely on the integrity of the endocrine function of the gonads. Once such healthy function is lost, men will experience nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, weak erection, and stunted genitals like those of a child. Women will experience menstrual irregularities, undeveloped breasts, lack of sexual sensation, vaginal discharge, and prolonged infertility. Neuroasthenia is the greatest morbidity of both sexes. Common symptoms for both sexes include insomnia, forgetfulness, palpitations, mental distraction, inability to concentrate, resulting in unfinished business, and a haggard and withered appearance. The beauty of youth is completely lost. When encountering such symptoms, it is necessary to take special endocrine preparations to transform such aging functions and give them a new vitality.</p>
<p>"Bu Ti Kang" for men and "Bu Nu Rong" for women, invented by Dr. Melen of Germany, are made by extracting hormones from the testicles and ovaries of juvenile male and female animals. It can promote the vigor of endocrine function and strengthen reproductive power, allowing full development. Therefore, male genital dysplasia, nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, weak erection, and female menstrual irregularities, vaginal discharge, etc. can be fundamentally cured. It can also make muscles plump, skin delicate, and eliminate insomnia, dizziness, etc. imperceptibly. Therefore, both men and women in Western countries love to use this medicine for its power to eliminate disease, maintain beauty, and rejuvenate.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Clinical Experience Record of Dr. Deng Yuanhe on Lung Diseases <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Cough and Phlegm Radically Cured, Nocturnal Emission Also Healed</p>
<p>Patient Xie Xiaoshan, 25 years old, student. Medical history: excessive masturbation, weak body, resulting in chronic tuberculosis. Symptoms: coughing, shortness of breath, white frothy sputum, decreased appetite, chest pain, insomnia, night sweats, nocturnal emission, back pain, ineffective use of various drugs, extreme emaciation. Only after six years did he come to my clinic for treatment. Prescription: X-ray examination of the lungs revealed cavities that could not be cured by ordinary medication. He was instructed to take German "Bu Fei Na Er" continuously for one month to clear phlegm and cough, strengthen the lungs, and at the same time take German "Bu Ti Kang" to treat nocturnal emission, insomnia, and other symptoms. Before he finished a few bottles, his appetite increased, his cough stopped, he slept soundly and his spirit was vigorous. I then instructed him to continue taking large doses to eliminate the root cause. Recently, on the anniversary of the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, I met him in the Bund Park. I saw that he was unusually stout and radiant, indicating that he had been cured for three years and had not relapsed. He said that he would graduate from the university in just one semester.</p>
<p>Hemoptysis and Asthma Cured Simultaneously in Father and Son</p>
<p>Patient Wan Xixian, 29 years old, businessman. Cause of illness: excessive indulgence in sexual activity and alcohol, resulting in hemoptysis. Symptoms: coughing, thick sputum, yellow or black, blood in sputum, many dreams, little sleep, palpitations, shortness of breath, nocturnal emission, impotence, marital discord. Listless, emaciated, treated repeatedly without success, and suffered terribly. He was introduced to my clinic for treatment by his colleague Zhang Guofu. Prescription: Diagnosis revealed that the lung disease had reached the second stage, and only German "Bu Fei Na Er" could cure it. About four bottles were prescribed, and blood sputum was completely eliminated, the cough stopped, and the stomach became healthy. At the same time, he was instructed to take "Bu Ti Kang" concurrently, so that he could sleep peacefully at night and nocturnal emission would stop spontaneously. Indeed, it was effective. Fearing a relapse, he was instructed to continue taking the previous medicine for about a month. His father, who suffered from phlegm and wheezing in his old age, reported that he was completely cured after taking "Bu Fei Na Er" for two weeks. Last week, I suddenly received a letter from Wan, saying that two years after recovery, his weight had increased by more than forty pounds. His blood and energy were abundant, his manhood was strong, and his erection was powerful. His wife had already given birth to a son.</p>

<p>New Treatment for Eradicating Old Gonorrhea</p>
<p>When people hear about old gonorrhea, they frown and worry, believing that once gonorrhea becomes chronic, it is like a death sentence. However, in fact, with the advancement of modern medicine, there is a way to radically cure it. The most stubborn and difficult to treat of gonorrhea is gonorrheal arthritis. According to my experience, the use of anti-gonococcal serum and X-ray therapy, and internal administration of "Ke Lin Nong," can always cure it in the short term.</p>
<p>Shen Zhibin, who lives on Xujiahui Road, had been suffering from gonorrhea for six years and arthritis for more than three years. His whole body was in joint pain, as if it had been crushed. His limbs could not move, urination was obstructed, and it was very turbid. His testicles were also in severe pain. He had difficulty walking, so he was in great pain. He had been treated by a foreign doctor for several months, but there was still no improvement. Later, he was introduced to my clinic by his brother-in-law, Li. Initially, he was given German anti-gonococcal serum for a week, followed by X-ray and electrical treatment, and internal administration of "Ke Lin Nong." After four weeks of treatment, he was radically cured. After examining his body, it was found that the epididymis had been injured due to long-term gonorrhea, resulting in a decline in the function of sperm production. He was given a large dose of "Bu Ti Kang" to restore his physical strength and he walked like the wind and was still a strong man.</p>

<p>— Li Fumin</p>
<p>If there is a sudden loss of appetite, loss of appetite, or stomach weakness due to excessive use of the brain or hard work, it is advisable to cure it as soon as possible, otherwise it will become chronic gastritis, malnutrition, loss of health, and deprivation of happiness. For example, Mr. Hu Shaotang, who lives on Xinjiang Road, occasionally reduced his appetite and could not eat due to overwork. Initially, he ignored it, and then he had belching and acid reflux, felt full as soon as he saw food, and experienced pain and bloating after eating. His weakness increased frequently, and he suffered from insomnia, constipation, and nocturnal emission. He consulted doctors for three years without any relief. Later, he came to my clinic for treatment. I prescribed "Qiang Wei Jing" to transform his gastric function and also instructed him to take "Bu Ti Kang" at the same time to treat insomnia and nocturnal emission. After taking it for less than a month, the effect was remarkable, and his appetite increased greatly, his bowel movements were smooth, his complexion was rosy, and his back was strong. The other day, a letter from him stated that after taking "Qiang Wei Jing" and "Bu Ti Kang" for a month, all his symptoms had disappeared, his weight had increased sharply, and his spirit was full. It was truly a case of rebirth from despair, all thanks to the efficacy of the good medicine.</p>

<p>Salvation from Cystitis</p>
<p>Patient Yan Chuanshi, from Nanjing, lives on Xinzha Road. Newly contracted gonorrhea, due to improper treatment, it suddenly changed into cystitis. Difficulty in urination, often unable to empty his bladder completely, lower abdominal pain, turbid urine, and nocturnal emission at night, pus and blood mixed in the semen, and was about to turn into seminal vesiculitis. He urgently sought my treatment. In addition to washing the bladder, I instructed him to purchase "Ke Lin Nong" to eradicate the gonococci and promote the dissipation of inflammation, so that urination would be smooth, the urine would be clear, and the pain and nocturnal emission would stop. After about four bottles, he was completely cured. Later, I received a letter from Mr. Yan, saying that after returning to Beijing, he had a serum test at a local hospital, and there was no gonococcal reaction, proving that it was completely cured. "My wife's gonorrhea was also completely cured after taking 'Ke Lin Nong' and using 'Ka Er Xue Di Shi' vaginal tablets for three weeks as recommended by your esteemed doctor. My wife and I are deeply grateful."</p>
<p>Weak Body with Gonorrhea Discharge</p>
<p>Patient Xiao Shiwen, living on Nanmatou, 26 years old, unmarried. Due to early masturbation and later gonorrhea, his body was weak, and the disease became more difficult to cure. The testicles were in dull pain, urination was short, blood was seen after urination, and nocturnal emission, insomnia, dizziness, and other symptoms followed one after another. He was haggard and miserable and sought my treatment. After diagnosis, it was found that he had a weak body and posterior urethritis. He was immediately given "Ke Lin Nong" to kill the latent gonococci and reduce the scope of inflammation, so that the gonococci could be eradicated. At the same time, he was instructed to purchase "Bu Ti Kang" to treat his insomnia, strengthen his body, and stop his nocturnal emission. After four weeks, all the symptoms disappeared, and he was stronger than ever. Later, he married his lady, and now his son is two years old.</p>

<p>Mr. He, 24 years old, committed masturbation at an early age, resulting in sexual neurasthenia and a small life force, like a twelve or thirteen-year-old child. He also suffered from nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation, insomnia, memory loss, dizziness, limb weakness, back pain, and other symptoms. Later, because his family urged him to get married, Mr. He was very embarrassed and anxious all night. He almost committed suicide. Then he suddenly found a copy of the "Bu Ti Kang" instruction manual and went straight to the Wuzhou Pharmacy to purchase half a dozen bottles. His life force immediately burst forth, and he was as tall and strong as a healthy man. All his diseases were also completely cured. Mr. He was very happy and immediately returned north, only five days away from his good times. It was also fortunate. This happened a few years ago, and now I hear that Mr. He has given birth to two sons in a row.</p>

Last spring, both sides of the testicles suddenly became swollen, the pain was like cutting, the walking was staggering, resulting in neurasthenia, insomnia, and nocturnal emission, and the body became thin day by day, and he suffered very much. He came to my clinic for diagnosis and treatment, and after taking five bottles of the German gonorrhea holy medicine "Ke Lin Nong", the swelling and pain in the testicles disappeared, the urine was clear and clean, and fearing that it would relapse, he was instructed to continue taking the previous medicine for three weeks, and then take the German "Bu Ti Kang" to treat neurasthenia, and it was cured. Because the family discussed marriage urgently, he went to the health department to test his blood three times, and there was no serum reaction, proving that the root was cut off. The five-year-old old gonorrhea was suddenly cured. Yesterday, he came to my clinic for business, saying that he had been married for two years, and the couple was happy and affectionate, and it was no different.

<p>Wonderful Medicine for Leukorrhea</p>
<p>Female leukorrhea, some are caused by diseases of the reproductive organs, and some are caused by unclean sexual intercourse. Leukorrhea caused by unclean sexual intercourse is mostly bacterial leukorrhea. The secretions in the patient's vagina do not stop all night and emit a peculiar odor (this odor is often unknown to the patient herself), which causes people to dislike her. And every obstacle occurs in childbirth. I met such patients and used the German "Ka Er Xue Di Shi" vaginal tablets to plug them, which can converge the lesion and cure it radically within two weeks. Those who have leukorrhea due to physical weakness, take "Bu Nu Rong" internally at the same time. Those who have leukorrhea because their husbands have gonorrhea, take "Ke Lin Nong" internally at the same time. Therefore, all can be radically cured. And "Ka Er Xue Di Shi" vaginal tablets can treat all uterine cancer, ovarian tumors, masturbation damage, vaginal inflammation, vulvar redness and swelling, etc., all of which can be cured in a short time, and can be treated at home, which is truly a wonderful medicine for leukorrhea and a gospel for the female world.</p>

<p>— Letter from Li Mingda, Hankou</p>
<p>(Above omitted) I accompanied the military brigade and mistakenly contracted gonorrhea, which relapsed from time to time. I received long-term treatment, and almost all kinds of injections were given, but none of them were radically cured. I thought it was incurable, so I abandoned medicine. In the autumn of the previous year, the elbows and knees were red, swollen, hot, and the pain was so severe that it penetrated the heart and lungs. It was difficult to move, and I became even thinner. Fortunately, on the advice of my friend Pan, I asked Dr. Yao Juyan for treatment. After using the latest German anti-gonococcal serum for treatment, the swelling and pain were reduced immediately. In less than three weeks, I was completely cured. X-ray treatment was used for about two weeks, and the joints were more comfortable than usual. The vitality was restored, the spirit was radiant, and the weight increased daily. Dr. Yao repeatedly used serum to check, and it was confirmed that the root was completely cut off. Since this radical cure, even with high stimulation such as sexual activity and drinking, it has never relapsed, which proves that Dr. Yao's treatment is precise and his ideas are unique. I am hereby writing a humble letter to express my sincere feelings and to be a compass for those who are confused by the same disease.</p>

<h3 id="e184">A Brief Discussion on the Progress of Biology in China in Recent Years <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Guangyu</p>
<p>Mr. Emil Bretschneider said: "The Chinese do not show a talent for observing nature, nor do they possess a sincere desire to seek the truth. These two qualities are essential for naturalists, yet the people of this country lack them. Chinese writing is often inaccurate, leading to ambiguity, and the Chinese tend to be fond of the strange, holding extremely naive views." This is a view from a position of idealism, dissecting very clearly the reasons why China has historically lacked biology. However, in the last ten years or so, biological research in China has progressed rapidly, already occupying a considerable position in the world of academia. So, why have our talent for observing nature and our enthusiasm for seeking the truth become so apparent now? This is naturally due to different social relations. Mr. Elsworth Huntington believes that Chinese farmers often encounter disasters and live in hardship, so they tend to be stingy and narrow-minded. From this, it can be inferred that in ancient China, because it was stagnant in an agricultural society, the capacity for production was weak, and obtaining a fulfilling life was difficult. Even those who were called wealthy were often unaware of the difficulty of survival and only thought about fame and profit all day long, and would not open their minds to scientific research. Therefore, biology would not develop until the capitalist society gradually emerged in China today.</p>
<p>Biology in books has been imported into China for decades. However, the study of biology through the observation of real objects and based on experiments has only a history of over a decade. This can be traced back to the establishment of the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China in the eleventh year of the Republic of China. Since then, only fifteen years have passed, but considerable achievements have already been made. In addition to the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China, research institutions include the Jing Sheng Biological Research Institute established in Beiping in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the National Central Research Institute's Natural History Museum (renamed the Institute of Zoology and Botany in the twenty-second year) established in Nanjing in the same year, the Beiping Research Institute's Institute of Zoology and Botany established in Beiping in the eighteenth year, and the Biological Research Institute of the China Western Academy of Sciences established in Beibei, Ba County, Sichuan in the twentieth year. Major well-known universities such as Central, Zhongshan, Peking, Tsinghua, Wuhan, Shandong, Zhejiang, Jinling, Yenching, and Lingnan have all established biology departments for specialized or regional research. In addition to the Science Society of China, academic societies include the Natural History Society of Beiping, the Chinese Zoological Society, the Chinese Botanical Society, the Chinese Physiological Society, the Marine Biological Society of Qingdao, and the Insect Interest Society of Nantong. Publications include the series reports of the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China, the series reports of the Jing Sheng Biological Research Institute, the series publications of the Agricultural and Forestry Botanical Research Institute of National Zhongshan University, and various other magazines and monographs. Most of these publications are written in Western languages and exchanged with famous research institutions and scholars around the world. In the case of the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China alone, there are more than five hundred such exchanges, which shows its attention to the world.</p>
<p>However, as far as general school education and general public knowledge are concerned, the research achievements of the above-mentioned research institutions and universities are still too focused on the profound and neglect popularization. This is because they have not yet been able to supply the textbooks used by general schools and the reading materials needed by the general public, and they still have to let the various bookstores fulfill this responsibility. Therefore, the progress of biological research in China in recent years, in terms of the profound, should be attributed to the above-mentioned research institutions and universities, and in terms of popularization, the contributions of the various bookstores should not be ignored either.</p>
<p>In recent years, the call for saving the country through science has become very loud. Biology inherently does not have many direct uses in saving the country, but in terms of indirect relations, agriculture, medicine, fisheries, organic chemistry, and so on all need to be based on biological research. Moreover, since Darwin established the theory of evolution, it has had a greater impact on human thought than any other theory in the past seventy years. Therefore, in this extraordinary period, popularizing biological knowledge to the general public is still a very important task.</p>
<p>China originally had no science, no biology. At this moment when biological research is just flourishing and beginning to achieve results, it is especially important to find ways to popularize the essence of these achievements to the general public, so that the general public can become the backing for in-depth research. Therefore, we believe that the biology books that various bookstores should publish now, in addition to good textbooks, should also pay attention to two aspects. One aspect is works like "Biological Sketches," recently recommended by the "Science" magazine, which "can both describe scientific facts and have literary flavor," which can break the general public's long-held notion that scientific books are dry and uninteresting, and unconsciously accept scientific influence. In addition to "Biological Sketches," this category of books includes "Flowers, Birds, Insects, and Fish," "Animal Anecdotes," "Birds and Literature," "Insect Talks," and "The Life of Insects" published by Kaiming Bookstore, all of which are good books worth recommending. The other category is large reference books based on Chinese materials, such as dictionaries, atlases, and rich taxonomic books. This type of book has not yet existed, which is what the publishing industry should strive to do in the future.</p>
<p>"Note": Regarding dictionaries, although there are already books such as the "Great Dictionary of Botany" and the "Great Dictionary of Zoology" on the market, because they are completely based on Japanese materials and were published a long time ago, general scholars deeply regard them as impractical. In the atlas category, there are the "Chinese Plant Atlas," "Chinese Fern Atlas," "Illustrated Guide to Common Trees in Hebei," and "Illustrated Guide to Common Fish in Hebei" published by the Jing Sheng Biological Research Institute, all of which have very exquisite content. However, the materials are few and the prices are high, so they are not suitable for general public use.</p>

<p>"...Concentrating my mind and racking my brains, I finally gained a thorough understanding and glimpsed the mysteries of truth, experiencing endless interest..."</p>
<p>I remember when I was in middle school, the teacher only told me that the sum of the three angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles, and I never heard that it was less than or greater than two right angles. Perhaps the teacher himself did not know. When I entered university, a teacher happened to mention in class that in non-Euclidean geometry, the sum of the three angles of a triangle is less than or greater than two right angles; however, he did not explain the reason. At that time, I found it very strange, thinking that the sum of the three angles of a triangle being equal to two right angles was not only theoretically unquestionable, but also had been tested and verified hundreds of times in practice. How could it become a problem? If it is said to be less than or greater than two right angles, what reasons can it be based on? Leaving the reasons aside for the moment, the facts clearly do not match. Moreover, geometry is such a precise science. If theorems proven in geometry are still unreliable, how much credible reasoning can there be in the world? However, since non-Euclidean geometry has been generally recognized, it certainly would not talk nonsense. My curiosity could not restrain itself, and I had to study non-Euclidean geometry to see what skills it possessed that it dared to overturn right and wrong and make such an astonishing strange argument. Therefore, I looked for it domestically and abroad, buying one, two, three, and four books on non-Euclidean geometry written by several scholars. Unfortunately, at first, I could not understand them no matter how much I read. On the surface, it seemed like I understood, but in my heart, I still did not understand. I endured it. If I didn't understand today, I would read it again tomorrow. If I still didn't understand tomorrow, I would continue the day after tomorrow. After several days of continuous reading, I still didn't understand, so I put it aside and read it later. This went on intermittently for a long time. Concentrating my mind and racking my brains, I finally gained a thorough understanding one day, glimpsed the mysteries of truth, and experienced endless interest. I believe that people who study ordinary geometry should not fail to understand non-Euclidean geometry. If they do not understand non-Euclidean geometry, not only is their knowledge shallow and limited, but they also do not know what geometry is (What is Geometry?). They only remember many theorems, but theorems are not of much value. Because I have seen many incomprehensible books on non-Euclidean geometry, I suffered a lot. When I couldn't understand them, I thought that after I had thoroughly understood them, I would definitely compile a book on non-Euclidean geometry that would be easy for people to understand. Now that I have gained entry to the subject, I am fulfilling my long-cherished wish by compiling this "An Elementary Explanation of Non-Euclidean Geometry." Geometry is a deductive science. The most basic and important thing is the clarification of principles. Once the principles are clarified, there are not many difficulties below. Therefore, this small book focuses on clarifying the principles. I have explained in detail the places that I found difficult to understand and that had to be thoroughly understood when I was learning. As long as someone who has studied ordinary geometry and has a relatively precise mind can understand my book. It is especially suitable for high school graduates or third-year high school students who have studied analytical geometry to read this book. Deficiencies and errors are inevitable. I would be grateful for any corrections from readers.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) Mr. Zhou wrote this article at the beginning of his book "An Elementary Explanation of Non-Euclidean Geometry" to tell us how he endured hardship and persevered, how he made up his mind to write and facilitate future scholars, and how he was careful and thorough in fulfilling his long-cherished wish. Anyone who reads this article will be moved by his spirit! We would like to contribute this to readers who aspire to study knowledge.</p>

<p>— Xiao Shunu</p>
<p>Written by Guo Moruo, published by Kaiming Bookstore, priced at 45 cents</p>
<p>If we want to explore Chinese literature and promote the Chinese literary revolution, we should be aware of a great revolutionary poet, Qu Yuan! Indeed, as a nobleman from the South, he fully accepted the temperament of popular art, created and adhered to his own poetic style, and boldly overthrew the aristocratic literature of the Taige style, leaving the most glorious page in the history of Chinese literature. If we have a love for literature, we cannot but first recognize this extraordinary poet with keen sensibility and understand his works to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>However, the problem arises from this: because Qu Yuan is already more than two thousand years away from us, all material evidence of his existence has disappeared, and the literature before the Biography of Qu Yuan in the Records of the Grand Historian is so scarce. Because of the omissions in the details of the Biography of Qu Yuan and the alterations made by later generations, some people even doubt Qu Yuan's existence. People like Ji Ping and Hu Shizhi have suspected that Qu Yuan may not have existed at all. Now their questions can be answered clearly in the book "Qu Yuan" written by Mr. Guo Moruo.</p>
<p>This book is divided into three chapters. The first chapter discusses in detail the existence of Qu Yuan and the criticism of the skeptical theory. The second chapter analyzes the age and authenticity of Qu Yuan's works. The third chapter describes the inheritance of Qu Yuan's thought and his artistic attitude. The author of this book not only relies on the materials in the books, but also looks for evidence in bronze inscriptions and oracle bone inscriptions. For example, he infers that "朕皇考曰伯庸" in the poem "Li Sao" is Qu Yuan's appellation for his father's name, based on the fact that it is common to see descendants referring to their fathers and grandfathers by their names in bronze inscriptions. How powerful is this argument! Here, the author also elaborately reveals Qu Yuan's family background, which not only makes us believe in his existence, but also fortunately allows us to understand the exact date of birth and death of this great poet from Guo's precise calculations of ancient calendars!</p>
<p>In the past, there were different opinions on his birthday. According to Liu Shipei's "Glimpse of Ancient Calendars," calculated according to the Xia calendar, his birthday should be on the 21st day of the first month of the 27th year of the false King Xuan of Chu (the 26th year of King Xian of Zhou - 343 BC). According to Chen's "Chronology of Zisi's Birth and Death," calculated according to the Zhou calendar, it would be on the 22nd day of the third month of the same year. However, Guo said that "his date of birth is seen in the 'Li Sao', '摄提贞于孟陬兮，惟庚寅吾以降', he was born in the first month of the year when Jupiter was in 寅,庚寅. According to the Preface to 'Lushi Chunqiu', '维秦八年，岁在鹑火', we know that 239 BC was the year of Shen. Pushing up, the 29th year of King Xuan of Chu (28th year of King Xian of Zhou) in 341 BC should be the year of Yin, but the first month of that year was small, 庚申朔, and there was no day of Gengyin... Jupiter surpassed the constellation once every 82.6 years. During that period, it surpassed the constellation once, and the year of Yin should be 340 BC. The first month of that year was small, 甲申朔, and Gengyin was the seventh day, which is consistent with the 'Li Sao'." I believe no one will have any doubts after reading his precise deduction.</p>
<p>Guo's invention is not limited to this. He pointed out from bronze inscriptions that the "Luan Yue" at the end of the Chu Ci is "Ci Yue". He also clarified from oracle bone inscriptions that "Heavenly Questions" is not a difficult work made by later generations - as Mr. Hu Shizhi said, but Qu Yuan's own work. The ironclad evidence he presented makes us feel the love and affection for the great poet.</p>
<p>Guo's book should be a rare specialized work. Recently, he said that this was originally written for the Kaiming Middle School Student Series, but it was too difficult, so he added an appendix "Modern Translation of 'Li Sao'" to make it independent (see "Qu Yuan's Era" in the February issue of Literature). Here, we should not easily let go of the translation in this appendix; I believe that anyone with a cultivation in old literature knows that translating ancient poems into modern poems is indeed a difficult task, because their language is obscure and it is often difficult to express them consistently. For example, "Li Sao" says "解佩紱以结言兮，吾令蹇修以为理". Wang Yi's commentary says that "'理' is '理分理也，述求婚之意也'", but still cannot point out its clear concept. Such a translation is certainly difficult: but Guo based it on the following "理弱而媒拙" and the chapter "Nine Chapters" "理弱而媒不通", and "Thinking of Beauty" "令謇荔以为理！囡芙蓉以为媒", proving that the matchmaker is called "理", "盖古者提婚人与媒妁人有别". Therefore, he translated it very clearly into the following verse: "我把兰佩解下来拜托了蹇修，我请他謇了去为我向她求爱." This is enough to show that the translator spent a lot of deep research. However, I think it is still necessary to add some explanation, otherwise the general public will not be able to understand how the orchid pendant is related to courtship. Now, according to the "Da Dai Li", "蔫氏之机，芗氏之藉", note that "兰柱香草名". "Materia Medica" says "'蘅' is fragrant, that is, Du Heng". Tang poetry: "'情人一去无穷已，欲赠蘅香恨不逢'". Therefore, "解佩紱以结言" means that men and women give fragrant objects to each other as a token of affection! In my opinion, "佩紱" is "香幃". Wang Yi said "'幃谓之香缨，赠香囊也'". "香囊" is also a "香囊", which both men and women wore in ancient times. The marriage is called "结藕", "亲以自思" in the "Guo Feng" of the Book of Songs. "香缨" and "容臭" are also the same thing. The note in "Li Neize" says "容臭，香物也. 助以形容之饰，以缨系之". Hong Xingzu's "Supplement to the Chu Ci" says "古者男女均佩容臭，香物也". This kind of fragrant pendant is related to sexual love. Fan Qin's poem "Ding Qing" in the Jin Dynasty says "'何以致叩叩？香囊系肘后'". The ancient story of "Peacock Flies Southeast" is even clearer, saying "'红罗复斗帐，四角垂香囊'". According to Li Tiaoyuan's "Notes on Guangdong" in the Qing Dynasty, volume 4, the people of South Vietnam, whenever men and women are about to have an affair, they offer a fragrant bag in front of the gods, and often get what they want. Enough, a long story! However, from this, it can be seen that Guo's translation has a full understanding of the original text.</p>
<p>In addition, Guo still has a question about the lines "名余曰正则兮，字余曰灵均" in the "Li Sao". If it is said that Qu Yuan is describing his name and style name, why doesn't he say "名平字原"? In fact: "Li Sao" is a true work from his later years after being exiled. - The people of Chu were influenced by the religious beliefs of the Yin people. It can be known from the frequent activities of shamans in his original works. This is because he was full of grievances, which made him more urgently need metaphysical relief. Doesn't the "Li Sao" say? ""愿依彭咸之遗则"",众山海经海内西红及大荒西经有""巫彭""巫咸""之名"",Wang Yi says""彭咸楚大夫，谏其君不听，自投水而死"". It is also said that ""巫咸古神巫也，当殷中宗之世"". Then Qu Yuan intended to become a shaman. "Li Sao" calls himself ""正则"" based on the ""彭咸之遗则"",and the style name ""灵均"" is taken from the meaning of the witches. ""和和"" and ""氛正"" are also shaman names. If my conjecture is not wrong. I hope Guo will add corrections when the book is republished.</p>
<p>I would like to introduce this book to young people with great respect. I firmly believe that it will arouse their interest in studying this great poet and his works.</p>
<h3 id="e187">The Literaryization of Science <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Meiye</p>
<p>——Introducing "Lectures on Meteorology"——</p>
<p>Most people love to read literary books but not scientific books. The reason for this is that studying science requires a precise mind and painstaking thinking, so they feel that science is boring and that scientific subjects give them a headache. In fact, we must know that no matter what kind of knowledge you study, "painstaking thinking" is inevitable. If you are afraid of painstaking thinking, you have no hope of succeeding in your studies. Taking literature as an example, if you do not think hard when reading, you will overlook the wonderful descriptions and the tortuous meanings. The reason why it is now felt that reading literary books is not difficult but reading scientific books is difficult is nothing more than the interest of the words.</p>
<p>Science is the key to improving human life. The modern world is a world of science. If the science of a country is not developed, this country is in danger of being swallowed up. Therefore, although we who are born today do not want to be great scientists, it is impossible not to know some common scientific knowledge in daily life.</p>
<p>Because the words in scientific books are mostly dry and boring, everyone does not like to read them, and they do not have common scientific knowledge in daily life. Living in today's scientific world, the danger of the future is really unbearable! According to a doctor, there are many medicines that are bitter and difficult to take, so they are specially mixed with sweet fruit juice to make people not feel difficult. I believe that scientific books, even if they are dry and tasteless, must be written in interesting words, just like adding sweet fruit juice to bitter medicine. I envy the good fortune of foreign children, who can read scientific works written in a literary style, such as Fabre's "Chemical Fables", "Stories of Science" (both of which have been translated by Kaiming Bookstore), "Our Earth", "Insect Records", and so on. When people read them, it is like reading novels, and scientific knowledge has been unknowingly drilled into the readers' minds.</p>
<p>Apart from a few translated books, there are not many of these interesting scientific works in China. But no matter how well you translate the translated books, they are foreign products after all. The national conditions of foreign countries are not the same as ours, and the materials of foreign countries are somewhat estranged from us Chinese. It is best for us Chinese to use their methods to make some domestic products ourselves. This book, "Lectures on Meteorology", is our exquisite domestic product. The beauty of the writing can be compared with Fabre!</p>
<p>This book is divided into nine lectures, which express the meteorology of wind, cloud, rain, dew, frost, snow, cold, heat, etc. by borrowing Mr. Mi's story to two nephews named Zijun and Zijie, so that we can gain meteorological knowledge after reading it. Originally, there were very few books on meteorology published in China, and the study of meteorology was as stuffy as learning mathematics. Because there are not many books published, and because the materials are boring, Chinese people do not pay attention to it as if it were rotten copper and iron. Try to hold a scholar who has read books for more than ten years and ask "How many kinds of clouds are there?" I believe his answer is "Two kinds, white clouds and black clouds", and he will have to laugh at you for asking a silly question, thinking that this is common sense that a four- or five-year-old child knows. But is his answer correct? We turn over the meteorology books and know that there are thirteen kinds of clouds, with different shapes and heights, and we also know that clouds are good at changing - the real change is not the change that we look up and see like a dog, and after a while it becomes like a person - each kind of cloud, becomes thicker and thinner, or may disappear, or may become another kind of cloud. The poems of great poets often use wind, cloud, rain, dew, frost, snow, etc. as poetic materials, so even those who study literature can get an extra kind of interest after reading this book and reminiscing about the chants of the great poets.</p>
<p>This book only uses the style of storytelling to describe the principles of meteorology, and there are also many places that can be experimented with, and pictures that can be referred to, so that readers can understand it more easily.</p>
<p>Everyone says that reading scientific books is dull and boring, but the authors, like doctors, can mix sweet things in bitter medicine, and naturally they can eliminate "dullness and boredom". Now that I have found such a good book, I would like to introduce it to readers. At the same time, I hope that the general writers can pay attention to this point, make science literary, change the idea that everyone has always disliked reading scientific books, and make the silent scientific community lively. This is really a kind of happiness in the reading world, and to put it bigger, it is the happiness of mankind! The far-sighted and energetic Kaiming Bookstore, may you continue to work hard after this book, I think my little hope will eventually be realized!</p>

<p>Japanese Grammar Explained by Aihua</p>
<p>Published by Kaiming Bookstore, priced at one yuan and forty cents</p>
<p>Opening recent newspapers, we often see advertisements for morning and evening cram schools in the enrollment columns. Analyzing these advertisements, almost half belong to Japanese language specialization courses. From this, we can imagine how our country's youth are paying attention to the work of "knowing yourself and your enemy" in their spare time. However, when we try to search for some suitable Japanese language textbooks from various publishers, as far as I know, there seem to be very few books for beginners that can integrate lessons, grammar, and exercises together with detailed explanations. General textbooks often neglect one thing for another. As for those for advanced learners and self-study, they are even scarcer. Therefore, many schools often adopt oral teaching methods or directly use Japanese books. This inevitably leads to errors, omissions, and inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Among the few good books on learning Japanese, I would like to introduce one that is more satisfying and suitable for teaching and self-study: "Japanese Grammar Explained" by Aihua.</p>
<p>The author said in the "Preface" of this book: "The author has two important intentions in writing this book: first, to enable readers to thoroughly understand the meaning of Japanese; second, to make it easier for readers to understand translation methods." I am unwilling to praise him for "being able to break through the difficulties felt by scholars in the past" just because he said these two sentences. Because many books are just blowing their own horns in the preface, but their content completely disappoints people. Let's honestly open the book and take a closer look:</p>
<p>The book uses Aesop's Fables translated by the Japanese Morning News Xiaobo as the text, which is both short and interesting. Most of these stories are already known to readers, making it easier to increase comprehension. But this is not its special feature. Its only good thing is that it can use the annotations of each sentence to give many examples, even listing them in tables, to meticulously explain the grammar of each word in the sentence, so that readers learn unintentionally, just like taking a bite of a steamed bun and eating the filling inside. Except for the easiest words and phrases, almost every sentence in the text is translated and explained in detail, so that beginners can fully understand it after reading it. After each lesson, there are also idioms and idiomatic expressions that readers should memorize, so that they can be specially memorized. From this, we can imagine how hard the author is working for the readers.</p>
<p>In addition, the translation methods of each sentence in the book also have many unique points. It is a pity that due to space and printing inconveniences, I cannot give a few examples. The whole book has a total of thirty lessons, totaling three hundred and fifty-four pages. If you study hard, you can finish reading it in at most three months.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that Mr. Aihua or other scholars who have a deep understanding of Japanese will publish more books of this kind, so that people who are new to Japanese will not feel a lack of reading materials.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Removing Misunderstandings Lies in Questioning <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>We cannot avoid misunderstandings in our interactions with the world, and we cannot avoid indignation when things go against our wishes. If we question, then the truth will be revealed and misunderstandings will be resolved. Otherwise, speculation, doubts in our hearts, arbitrary criticism, or ridicule will cause misunderstandings between each other. On the receiving end, they may not even know why this happened? There is no way to find the root cause, is this not a matter of regret? Leaving aside other matters, let's talk about telecommunications:</p>
<p>Telecommunications is one of the public utilities and is closely related to the interests of users - senders, receivers, or telephone users. If the telephone is not working, or the telegram is not delivered or delayed, then the user will naturally be dissatisfied. However, whether the reason for the failure or delay is due to the negligence of the telegraph office cannot be determined without questioning or investigation. If it is confirmed that the telegraph office made a mistake, then the telegraph office will handle it according to the telegraph or telephone business regulations and various telecommunications laws, and at the same time, it should refund the extra expenses to the user and express its apologies. If the error is not in the telegraph office, then the telegraph office is not responsible legally or morally.</p>
<p>If users have opinions, they should not ask the telegraph office or conduct an investigation, but instead spread what they have encountered and suffered to the outside world, saying, "The telegram is not delivered," or "The telephone is not working." From the perspective of knowledgeable people, this person and these words are quite lacking in reason, unclear about the regulations, and not what the telegraph office wants.</p>
<p>I read a news item in a Nanjing newspaper entitled "Telephone Cannot Be Connected." The sender, Mr. So-and-so, sent a telegram to the Xiaguan Telegraph Office at 11 p.m. one night, but no one answered the door, and the telegram was not sent. He then sent a letter to a newspaper to describe his experience. After investigation by the business inspector, the office did not close at night, the sender did not need to knock, and the staff were on duty day and night, so there was no reason why no one would answer the door. Moreover, it was found that several merchants sent telegrams at that time on that night, which can be proven by the telegraph records. It can be seen that Mr. So-and-so knocked on the wrong door and could not enter, so the telegram could not be sent. We express our deep sympathy, but it is a pity that we did not investigate and immediately concluded that "the telegram cannot be delivered," causing a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>On the part of the telegraph office, we are eager for people in the society to tell us the actual situation of sending and receiving telegrams and calls. Therefore, we have set up business inspectors and held communication inspection sessions. We especially hope that people in the society will understand the regulations for sending and receiving telegrams and calls. Therefore, we issue this publication, give regular broadcasts, and send various regulations. If various sectors send bureaus or use telephones to inquire about various regulations or procedures, we will sincerely welcome them. Only by removing all misunderstandings and explaining all doubts can we achieve the goal of close cooperation.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Supplement to the Writing and Charging Methods for the Address and Name of the Recipient of Chinese Telegrams <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Baozhen</p>
<p>Detailed regulations on the writing and charging methods for the address and name of the recipient of Chinese telegrams are already included in the current domestic telegraph business regulations. However, for Chinese private telegrams sent from a certain recipient to another person, for example, "Zhang Boyu c/o No. 5, Lane 538, Matte Hesituo Road, Shanghai, to Zeng Zhonggong," it is not clearly stipulated whether the words after "c/o" should be included in the recipient's address and name or in the telegram text when calculating the number of words. As a result, telegraph office clerks often still include words such as c/o or forwarding to someone in the telegram text when calculating the fee for the above telegrams submitted by the sender, as usual. It is now learned that in order to facilitate the sender, the Ministry of Communications has specially issued a notice to various telegraph offices to stipulate supplementary methods as follows:</p>
<p>(1) For Chinese private telegrams sent from a certain recipient to another person, regardless of whether the recipient's address and name are written in detail with words, or the address is replaced with a telephone number or a mailbox number, the second recipient's name should be allowed to be included in the recipient's address and name together with the word "c/o" or the two words "forward to." For example, (1) "Zhang Zhongchi c/o No. 288, Matte Hesituo Road, Shanghai, to Wang Shumei - I hope you will return to Ping quickly," (2) "Chen Zhiren c/o Nanjing Dialect (31788) to Ye Erheng - Has the money been remitted? Please reply by telegram," (3) "Huang Yongfu c/o Qingdao Mailbox (275) to Dai Shiquan - Qingmi...". The recipient's address and name in the first example above have a total of fifteen characters. According to the third item of Article 83 of the domestic telegraph business regulations, two characters are exceeded, so it should be charged as five characters (the place name of the receiving area is charged as two characters). The recipient's address and name in the second example do not exceed thirteen characters and can be charged as three characters according to the regulations. The recipient's address and name in the third example are all charged at four characters according to the regulations because it is a Chinese coded private telegram.</p>
<p>(2) For Chinese private telegrams sent from a registered household to another person, the nature is the same as those sent c/o a certain recipient and should be handled in the same way according to the regulations in the previous paragraph. The writing format stipulated in Article 45 of the domestic telegraph business regulations should also be supplemented as follows:</p>
<p>Registered word Receiving place name C/O someone Telegram</p>
<p>○○二二 Beiping C/O Wang Weicheng ...</p>
<p>The registration number and all the characters after the word "transfer", in the Chinese Mingyu private telegram, which do not exceed thirteen characters in total, or in the Chinese coded private telegram, which do not exceed fourteen characters in total, should be allowed to be charged as three characters or four characters respectively.</p>
<p>For Chinese telegrams with two or more recipient names, except for those marked by the sender with the words "send several copies" and charged, they should be handled according to the method of sending telegrams separately: those that are not marked by the sender, the telegraph office clerks often still list only the first recipient's name in the address and list the second recipient's name as the telegram text and charge by the number of words, as usual. For example, "Kang Minggang, Central Hotel, Daxinggong, Nanjing - Chen Guohua will come with you," the telegram will inevitably be inconsistent with the original intention. It is learned that the Ministry of Communications has also ordered all telegraph offices to allow the names of two or more recipients contained in the telegram to be included in the recipient's address and charged according to the regulations, but only if they belong to the same address.</p>
<p>After the implementation of the above supplementary methods, it will be convenient for all sectors, especially for telegrams, such as "Mr. Zou Guoliang and Ms. Jian Peihua, Dahuah Hotel, Shanghai - Congratulations on your happy wedding and wish you happiness without measure, Yongmei." The two recipient names in the telegram are included in the address, and there is no disadvantage of segmentation. The recipient's address and name in the telegram have a total of fourteen characters and should be charged as four characters according to the regulations. Since the sender of the telegram did not mark "send two copies", the receiving office only needs to send one copy to the first recipient when delivering the telegram. If the first recipient is not there, the telegram will be sent to the second recipient. This applies to those with two or more recipients by analogy.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Talking about Things that Senders Often Neglect <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Li</p>
<p>Since the publication of the Telegraphic Special Edition, it has indeed made many contributions to the outside world. Today, the telegraphic business is becoming increasingly closer to the public, and this cannot but be attributed to it. However, while there are many people who understand the telegraphic business and use telegrams as much as possible, there are still many who do not know how to send telegrams. I would like to use a corner of this publication to tell readers about the places that people who send and receive telegrams usually neglect.</p>
<p>1. Chinese Mingyu self-translators must add notes:</p>
<p>According to Article 42 of the Domestic Telegraph Business Regulations: "Chinese Mingyu private telegrams shall not only contain code words without text," the receiving clerks in various places must ask the sender to add text to this type of telegram without text, which is in accordance with the regulations. Often, due to unclear transmission by the servant or the sender's habit of sending official military telegrams, they do not write text even when occasionally sending ordinary telegrams. Even after many explanations, it is easy to cause unpleasantness or misunderstandings. I would like to reiterate this to remind senders to pay attention. The Ministry of Communications' intention in formulating this regulation is nothing more than to seek benefits for senders. Because if the sender does not add notes, there is no way to correct any errors in the interpretation of the code words. If notes have been added, the receiving clerk can check and correct them at any time, so that the recipient will not receive a telegram that is unreadable. This directly helps senders and receivers and indirectly contributes to the reputation of the telegraph office, thereby achieving the ultimate goal of telegraphs serving the people.</p>
<p>2. The telegraph receipt must state the sender's name and address</p>
<p>The sender's name and address must be written in detail on the telegram paper. If the telegram cannot be delivered properly, the sender can be notified according to the address written. Otherwise, the telegram cannot be delivered and the sender cannot be notified. Therefore, detailed notation of the sender's name and address is of great convenience to the sender.</p>
<p>It often happens that general commercial firms send telegrams with only one line of name or store number and often do not affix a seal. The telegraph office often accommodates and processes the telegrams for the convenience of the sender and immediately accepts them. However, from the perspective of commercial firms, this is actually dangerous! If unscrupulous elements impersonate the commercial firm and send telegrams to commit evil deeds and fraud, the telegraph office will not be responsible for any major losses incurred. Therefore, it is hoped that major commercial firms will pay attention and affix a seal when sending telegrams in the future. It is best to have a secret code and notify the authorities to check and verify, so as to be more solemn. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e194">The Relationship between the Time Difference between China and Various Places in the World <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>Since the successive opening of the direct circuits from the Ministry of Communications' International Radio Station to all parts of the world, international telegrams transmitted via Cgra are all extremely fast and accurate, and have been praised by all sectors. However, the speed of the telegram paper is based on the original sending time as the standard. Therefore, the "time" item is quite important on the telegram. It is found that the time in China and various places in the world, due to geographical relations, differs from the time in major cities in the world by tens of minutes or tens of hours, with varying differences. If you are not an expert in frequently used international telegrams, it may be difficult to understand the details. Now, in order to facilitate the investigation of the transmission time of international incoming telegrams, for the sake of universality, the time difference between China and various places in the world is listed separately on the left:</p>
<p>Explanation</p>
<p>When checking the transmission time of international incoming telegrams, you can use the above table. For those whose time is faster than China's time, subtract the faster time from the original sending time. For those whose time is slower, add the slower time. Then you can calculate it. For example, if a telegram from Tokyo, Japan, is sent at 9:15 and received at 10:15, then the transmission time is known to be two hours. That is, 10.15 - (9.15 - 1.00) = 2.00, 21.00 - (10.00 + 8.00) = 3.00, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Questions and Answers <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>This publication has a special column for questions and answers. People from all walks of life are welcome to ask questions about the procedures for sending and receiving telegrams and telephones, or about the telecommunications regulations that are not clear, or when there are questions about telecommunications common sense. This publication expresses its welcome and will answer them in detail.</p>
<p>1. Mr. Hu Kaiming from Tianjin asks: Our office has previously received many official telegrams in Mingyu (plain language) from various parties, which were all self-translated by me, which I found quite troublesome. Recently, the telegrams received have been translated and sent by the telegraph office, which is very convenient. However, there are cases where they are not translated. I don't know what the telegraph office's procedures are? Please advise.</p>
<p>(Answer) In order to show thoughtful service, the Ministry of Communications has specially ordered all bureaus that, from March 1, all incoming official telegrams in Ming code (plain code), except for cipher code, should be translated and delivered by the receiving office. If you receive a Mingyu official translation later, or an urgent, ordinary telegram, or a communication telegram, if it is not translated, please negotiate with the telegraph office.</p>
<p>2. Liu Zihe from Wuxian asks: A friend installed a telephone at the telephone office on January 14, and then removed it on February 18. The telephone office wants to charge two months' rent, is this legal?</p>
<p>(Answer) According to Article 36 of the Ministry of Communications' regulations on the operation of local telephones, "If a user installs a machine on or before the 15th of the month and removes the machine on or after the 16th, the rent will be calculated for the entire month." The telephone office's charge for two months' rent is not unreasonable.</p>
<p>3. Hua Wenxiu from Zhengxian asks: A long-distance telephone call has been notified and has already been transmitted, but the station has not been answered within the specified period. If the caller requests to cancel the number, how should it be handled?</p>
<p>(Answer) The cancellation fee should be waived, and all special force fees should be refunded.</p>

<h3 id="e196">The Situation After the German Army Marched into the Rhineland <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Neng</p>
<p>After the German army suddenly marched into the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland the other day, all countries were shocked, especially France, which was preparing for war, mobilizing troops, and dispatching generals. As of now, the number of German troops arriving one after another has reached as many as 60,000. The situation of the war is in sight. A journalist from a certain country predicted that the European war would begin in the summer of next year, and people will secretly laugh at the error of observation.</p>
<p>According to the French government, there can be no negotiations as long as there is a German soldier stationed in the Rhineland. According to the German government, it is absolutely impossible to withdraw a single soldier. Moreover, the distance between the two countries is only a river apart. Not to mention cannons, even pistols can come into contact. Assuming that there is no possibility of war at this point, it is either foolish or crazy.</p>
<p>In fact, the beginning of the war depends entirely on the third party, Britain, and not on France. France believes that Germany's tearing up of the Locarno Treaty this time is a terrible thing, and fears that Germany will first station troops in the Rhineland, and secondly, take back the lost territory during the war. If this is not dealt with head-on, the consequences will be disastrous. Therefore, France believes that the seriousness of this incident lies here.</p>
<p>But what is Britain's attitude? Britain is determined not to have a second major war. There are two reasons for this: (1) In the Italian-Ethiopian War, although Britain expressed great dissatisfaction, it did not dare to use force to sanction it, let alone economic sanctions. Now there is the possibility of a British-Italian compromise. Moreover, in the Far East, since the Tokyo Incident in Japan, the means of aggression have become even more obvious. If the Franco-German War is added, it will inevitably create a situation of world war. These are all facts that are in sight.</p>
<p>(2) Examining the sudden march of the German army into the Rhineland, the Rhineland was originally German territory. It is a matter of course for German troops to be stationed on German territory. It cannot be said that Germany is taking excessive actions. Assuming that the army of Country A is stationed on the territory of Country B, or the army of Country B is stationed on the territory of Country C, that is wrong. Therefore, according to a Paris dispatch the other day, "Britain believes that Germany's re-stationing of troops in the Rhineland cannot be used as a basis for imposing sanctions on Germany, because Germany's actions are not of an aggressive nature." This is still a fair argument, but the French will definitely be very dissatisfied when they hear it.</p>
<p>France believes that the seriousness of this German violation of the Locarno Treaty cannot be overstated. In fact, looking back, I don’t know how many so-called treaties and alliances have already been torn up, and their violations are completely aggressive in nature. Therefore, the German army's re-stationing in the Rhineland is considered by the French to be a serious matter, but in the eyes of other countries, it is not uncommon.</p>
<p>Now Europe's response to Germany's abandonment will be moved to London for discussion, which shows that the situation is easing. Because the French are now excited and very fierce, it is not easy to have a level-headed discussion in this passionate environment. Therefore, it is a strategy to lure the tiger away from the mountain. This also shows Britain's dilemma. Therefore, the European war has not yet reached a mature stage, which can be seen from this.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Lantern Festival <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Fangzhou</p>
<p>Many families in Shirentou were busy for several days and nights. Huang Boshou went to the city to buy foreign yarn, red candles, and all the necessary sundries. Zhang Amao directed the construction of the lantern racks and directed the people who played the roles. Wu Xiaosan went to the major households to borrow the jewelry and costumes used for the horses in the parade, and the costumes in the local opera. The whole village was bustling as if something big had happened. The Huang Family Ancestral Hall, which was usually so deserted that ghosts could be caught, was almost crowded with people day and night these days. Some were splitting bamboo, some were building frames, some were pasting foreign yarn, some were painting flowers, and everyone was working in division of labor and cooperation, and everyone's heart was filled with a kind of exciting enzyme.</p>
<p>"What are you playing, Ah San?" Jin Sheng asked Sanhe like this two days before the lantern parade: "You must be ready!"</p>
<p>"No!" Sanhe smiled and shook his head.</p>
<p>"You play a henpecked husband, Sanhe, you are very good at saying dead words." Genbao took over and offered Sanhe his opinion.</p>
<p>"No, I want to play a clam catcher, and I want to ask your madam to play the clam spirit, what do you think?" Sanhe asked Genbao playfully.</p>
<p>"Then please ask your own Jade Emperor!"</p>
<p>"No, she's too old, the clam spirit should be young and beautiful."</p>
<p>"Okay, let's do this, you play a crab catcher, then call your wife to be an old crab, isn't this fresh and convenient?"</p>
<p>Many people laughed at what they said, and even Genbao himself laughed triumphantly, but Sanhe uninterestedly took off Genbao's new felt hat from his head and threw it to the door.</p>
<p>On the night of the lantern parade, the village was already full of a joyful atmosphere. Many children sneaked out of the back door as soon as they finished dinner. The sound of gongs, drums and firecrackers in the distance was faintly sent to the ears of every villager. The dogs in the village were howling and running wildly. A banquet for receiving the parade horses was set up in the Mengjiang Hall in front of the mountain. A large crowd of men, women, and children had already gathered on the not-so-wide open space in front.</p>
<p>The sky was pitch black, without stars or moon, but the hillsides on both sides were crowded with many people watching the parade horses. From the foot of Jilong Mountain to Huangye Ridge, there was almost no empty space to be found.</p>
<p>The parade of horses left the Huang Family Ancestral Hall and meandered along the gravel road and Meihua Bridge towards Huangye Ridge. The lights shone in the dark night, like a golden snake several miles long. The sounds of gongs, drums, and firecrackers had already broken the silence of the deep night, scaring the birds that lived in the woods and making them fly around in the dark.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Nonsense <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— (Blow)</p>
<p>A-guo Army General Muruqi passed away on the 8th at the age of seventy. According to A-guan court's claim, he died of pneumonia. Tan Lao San said, "This old man will be angered to death even if he doesn't die of illness."</p>
<p>The US government stated that the dispute caused by Germany's abandonment of the Locarno Treaty in Europe has no impact on the United States. Therefore, the US government will never intervene in Germany's re-stationing of troops in the Rhineland. Tan Lao San said, "Pushing the moon out of the door and ignoring the frost on other people's roofs." The United States pushes the affairs of Germany and France completely away, but the United States also seems to have participated in the European war. Therefore, some people say that the United States' Monroe Doctrine is a half-open door. If there is a gap to take advantage of, then it says "I cannot sit idly by." If it is a bit awkward, then it immediately "revises the Neutrality Act," a brilliant move.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Pilgrims <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xuan</p>
<p>When I was a child, around the third month, peach blossoms bloomed like a pink sea, and the snow melted into the green waves of wheat fields. The village roads in my hometown became lively.</p>
<p>A large reed mat shed was erected at the north entrance of the village, with several long tables and chairs inside. On the tables were ridiculously large gray earthenware teapots. A kind old man continuously poured lukewarm tea from a pot. Besides making tea and lighting incense, he squatted by the soft, damp roadside all day. When passersby approached the shed, the old man stood up, cracked his sunken mouth, and said with a smile:</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>"You must be tired, have a cup of tea before continuing your journey."</p>
<p>When the walkers stood firm, they cupped their hands to the old man, unloaded the yellow packages from their backs, and placed them respectfully on the square table inside the shed, where a deity was enshrined. They respectfully stood the packages in the niche, picked up three incense sticks from the table, lit them from the black, smoky oil lamp, bowed to the deity, and inserted the incense into the incense burner. Turning around, they took a black earthenware bowl from the head of the long table, approached the mouth of the massive teapot that looked like it was pregnant, and poured out a bowl of thick, red tea swirling with many dark specks. They lifted it to their lips and gulped it down.</p>
<p>This teahouse was specifically for the pilgrims 'paying homage to the summit'. The travelers drank their fill of tea and rested on the long benches. Then, they carried their apricot-yellow packages again and cupped their hands to the old man, saying:</p>
<p>"See you on the way back, do you want anything from the mountains?"</p>
<p>"No, no, take it slow when climbing the winding path."</p>
<p>This kind old man never tired of seeing off each pilgrim, and the pilgrims flowed endlessly, intermittently walking along this road from the beginning of the third month.</p>
<p>Like these people traveling alone on mountain roads, who were running incense, they were very poor. Most were old couples in their eighties or nineties, sincerely worshiping the gods, and middle-aged bachelors who liked to gamble, along with mischievous young rascals who loved excitement. Wealthy people seized two-wheeled carts, bringing their wives and children, the carts loaded with cooked pork pancakes, white liquor, and playing cards. The cart driver cracked the long leather whip in his hand, driving the livestock forward. The family sat in the cart, playing cards for a while, drinking a few sips of strong liquor. When the young men were happy, they stole glances at the fashionable women in the carts ahead and behind. The older ones mostly liked to doze off or go to the Emperor's cart to gamble. The girls were generally more honest, occasionally glancing at the men, and if their mothers saw them, they would inevitably get scolded. The girls blushed and didn't dare to look up for a long time... Thus, like a vast picture of displaced people, they spent two days and one night approaching the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>In addition, there were pilgrims fulfilling vows. They had all vowed to the Holy Mother of the North Tortoise Mountain peak for their relatives' unexpected disasters or illnesses, undertaking a cruel self-torture: the better ones dressed themselves as strangely shaped beasts, such as human-bodied, ox-headed or pig-headed monsters, or some kind of evil spirit. Once dressed, they left home and ran all the way to the mountain to burn incense before removing their costumes and turning back into humans.</p>
<p>The most pitiful were some old women who, to pray for the blessing of their sons or husbands, led their young daughters, kneeling down and kowtowing with each step, so they could rush to the mountain to burn incense. The mountainous road, covered with yellow dust and small and large pebbles for more than two days, was too much for the elderly and children to bear. On the way, they often fainted naturally, resting for a day at any village entrance or river crossing teahouse. Once their energy was restored, they continued walking, kneeling and kowtowing with each step. There were also those who made vows for their own illnesses or deaths. When they went to fulfill their vows, they bizarrely dressed as four-legged animals, crawling along with some pilgrims, draped in saddles and wearing bridles on their faces, just like a cart horse. However, a small incense burner was tied to the saddle, with incense burning inside. They crawled for hundreds of miles, the smoke from the burner always喷著non-stop. At night, they took down the incense burner, slept with the saddle on their backs, until they paid homage at the peak and climbed down the mountain.</p>
<p>Wealthy homeowners could donate robes, apply gold, and send plaques to the Holy Mother, and would not do such karmic things as making themselves into cattle and horses.</p>
<p>At the end of March, the pilgrims all walked towards home with walnuts, black dates, persimmon cakes, and some wild mountain fruits. By chance, there were spring rains those few days, and they were drenched like water chickens, but they still happily walked in the rain, telling each other:</p>
<p>"Someone fell down a slope at Dian Shan, this year the devil is scared."</p>
<p>"All that blood on the hillside!"</p>
<p>"At Yama's nose, a mother and daughter rolled into the mountain stream together."</p>
<p>They meant it was retribution for those who fell down the hillside and didn't repair it or respect the gods. I knew that on those narrow, treacherous mountain roads, where three people couldn't squeeze past each other, there was a chance of falling with a single misstep. Thousands of people crowded and poisoned each other as they crawled upwards, like ants. When someone fell from the hillside, people shouted wildly:</p>
<p>"Sinful, sinful!"</p>
<p>"The Holy Mother has eyes, retribution!"</p>
<p>No one cared, and by the time they rolled down with broken bones and shattered bones, the corpses no longer looked human. Many people gathered around to fabricate some absurd rumors to explain the sins of the deceased in their lifetime.</p>
<p>The residents of the mountain country were still ruled by gods. I thought of their simple character and hardworking spirit, and I also remembered how pitifully they were deceived.</p>
<p>They are like rocks, forgotten by modernity.</p>

<p>— Illustration by Wan Chao Chen, Explanation by Xin Xin</p>
<p>While Mrs. Linton was asking who that person was, Dr. Nan Gai came out of Helmer's room.</p>
<p>Nora introduced them and read about the 'incurably morally ill' Krogstad, who had a position at the bank and was desperately calling for life.</p>
<p>Thinking of Krogstad being under Helmer's control, Nora happily stuffed macaroons into Nan Gai's mouth.</p>
<p>At this time, Helmer came out, and Nora introduced Mrs. Linton to him, along with a job.</p>
<p>When Helmer, Mrs. Linton, and Nan Gai went out together, they encountered Nora's 'little darlings' at the entrance.</p>
<p>Nora: Kitty, didn't you see? Aren't they lovely?</p>
<p>Helmer: Mrs. Linton, let's go. Only mothers can endure this cold.</p>

<p>— Written by Liu Yawei</p>
<p>Sailor: The gangplank is being raised, no one is allowed to come down anymore! (Steamboat whistle sounds again)</p>
<p>Relief worker: Didn't I make it clear? No one famous is allowed on board! Are you deaf?</p>
<p>Sailor: (Shouts) The ship is leaving! (Sound of ship wheels churning water, iron striking, rudder turning)</p>
<p>Old Xiang: What's wrong? Little Lu hasn't finished his cake yet?</p>
<p>Little Lu: : No, I remembered how bitterly my brother died!</p>
<p>Fifth Aunt: (Sobbing) We don't even know where our father is!</p>
<p>Fifth Elder: (Comforting) Ah! Our lives are a free gift. I almost fell off the dam too!</p>
<p>Old Xiang: Why are you still talking about it? Who isn't sad! Who isn't upset! But... who can we blame?</p>
<p>(Dragging this group of heartbroken people stranded at the edge of the sea onto the waterway, the sound of the steamboat gradually fades away, leaving only the disturbed waves returning to the calm river surface. One can vaguely hear someone inside the ship saying: 'Who can we blame?').</p>

<p>Opening 'Ode to the Red Cliff'</p>
<p>The romantic scholar was exiled to Huangzhou. He indulged in wandering by the river every day. On the fifteenth day of the seventh month of the Renxu year, he chatted with two or three close friends. Carefree, they boarded a boat at the Red Cliff. Soon, the moon rose from the east mountain, and they leaned on the railing, gazing at the stars. They struck the strings and sang to the bright moon. They frequently offered toasts to Li Bai. With clear song and subtle music, the guest echoed the sound. The guest was a Taoist priest from Western Sichuan, who played softly and harmonized melodiously. Like a lonely boat. How happy was Cao Mengde back then, composing poetry and wielding his spear with joy. He descended to Jiangling and conquered Jingzhou. Thousands of miles flowed smoothly with the wind. Indeed, he was a hero of his time, but where is he now? Thirty-six thousand days easily pass. How fortunate is human life, like a mayfly. One must see through vain fame and fortune. Speaking of poverty and success, I am ashamed. They washed their cups, drank, and gathered the food. The scattered cups and plates were not in order. They rested together on pillows in the small boat.</p>

<p>Opening 'Longing for Spring'</p>
<p>Green willows suddenly appear on the street. I lean alone on the railing, feeling depressed. Sorrow locks my brow, and my heart is drunk. I regret letting my husband go on a distant expedition. I only see the red and purple flowers in the clear garden, like brocade. Butterflies and bees complain and store up the good spring. The flourishing scenery fills me with resentment. I rely on caressing my jade zither to express my feelings. I only see that, burning incense, I press the icy strings. After playing a song, my heart is moved. My heart is anxious. My mind is deep. Counting the days, I eagerly await his return. At night, the lamp flower predicts good news, and in the morning, magpies are good omens. My troubled heart turns nine times and I am alarmed again. I don't know if he has a gentle乡 in another place. He doesn't care about my refinement and goes to marry elsewhere. If he lingers in the flowers and is unfaithful, I will treat the old and new with equal affection. I want to ask him, how will he comfort my娇嗔 when he returns? I have recently given up sewing. I am tired of leaning against the silver bed, suffering from illness. I hate that I can't abandon all kinds of longing. I resent that my dreams are upside down, and I am even more heartbroken. Fortunately, my neighboring sisters come to advise me. I should wear green embroidered shoes and go hiking. Remember that tomorrow is the Flower Festival. Beautiful flowers and金铃 . The birds sing on the branches with good news.</p>
