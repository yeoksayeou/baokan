<p>時評</p>
<h3>黃埔闢港和粵漢廣九接軌問題</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>自粤漢鐵路通車以後。當局就積極準備建築黃埔支綫。開闢黃埔商港。使粤漢鐵路通達海口。便利客貨吞吐。而廣州可以成為一個世界的大商港。原來廣州在鴉片戰爭以前。不僅是中國南部的商業中心。中國的重要商港。且是太平洋沿岸的大都市。亞洲的商業中心。它在整個中國經濟上的地位。很是重要。鴉片戰爭以後。它的地位。才漸為香港所奪。孫中山先生有鑒及此。曾欲完成粤漢鐵路。改良廣州黃埔水道。以復興廣州固有的經濟地位。不幸這個計劃在他生前無由實現。現在全國統一。當局着手進行。自然是一件可喜的事。</p>
<p>依照鐵路的定例。一切幹路的起點或終點。必須有一端連接於海口或水深的河道。始可充分吞吐客貨。便利運輸。兼收水陸交通的利益。粤漢鐵路南起廣州黃沙河。北經湘鄂達漢口。和平漢路相接而成為貫通我國南北的大幹綫。不過它的起點和終點所連接的地方。都是淺水內河。未能充分發揮它在運輸經濟上的作用。故鐵道部打算把粤漢鐵路的起點移到黃埔。以符合鐵路幹綫的定例。不過黃埔雖在海濱。而海水甚淺。二三萬噸以上的船舶。不能出入。所以當局於積極建築黃埔支錢之外。又要積極改良黃埔的水道。使現代航海最大的船舶。可以隨時出入無碍。這個計劃實現以後。一定可使廣州的市面繁榮起來。</p>
<p>然而在黃埔闢港進行的期間。我們卻還聽到粤漢路和廣九路接軌的傳說。如果這是確實的事。那麽。上述的計劃固然不能實現。廣州也將無由成為世界的商港。在另一方面。香港和九龍反可成為中國南部的唯一出入口。而英國在華南發展其商務的大木營了。因為香港和九龍港闊水深。在黃埔關港未完成前。把粤漢路和廣九路連接起來。則香港和九龍正可利用其港闊水深的優點。而成為粤漢路的吞吐港。這是足以砠碍廣州的繁榮的。</p>
<p>這個問題的利弊如何。孫中山先生在建國方略中也說得很明白。「廣州成為一世界港。則香港之為舶船載貨站頭之一切用處。自然均將歸於無有矣。但以此旣開發之廣州與旣繁榮之中國論。必有他途為香港之利。而比之現在僅為一退化貧窮之中國之獨占海港。利必百倍可知。……如是香港當局正當以其全力。鼓勵此改良廣州以為海港一事。不應復如向日。以其全力阻止之矣。」基上所述我們深望粤漢路和廣九路接軌之說。不致實現。而廣州海港的建築。香港當局也能予以同情的援助。</p>

<h3>南洋商業考察團　在荷印交涉輸入國貨</h3>
<p>巴達維亞迪訊、中華工業國外貿易協會主辦之南洋商業考察團、自來爪哇後、各方印象甚佳、僑胞歡迎允為熱烈、考察團全體團員、在團長高事恒氏領導下、與總領事館及輸入商會及吧城商會等合作協助、作種種外交活動極為令人注意、向例國人之來爪哇、入境手續異常苛煩、此决南洋商業考察團之南來、雖非官塲所派遺、但荷印政府、非常重視、荷總督特訓令各屬招待、凡入境手續、均特別優待、出入極為便利、引起華僑不少好處、惟考察團來後、雖作種種努力、企圖國貨之輸入、但格於荷印統制貿易、凡各種貨品均有規定之限制、在荷印輸出入統計上、與中國發生之關係、中國方面甚屬低微、查一九三二各國輸入荷印之百分比率、中國祇佔百分之一六、以國次論、為第十二位、同年荷印輸往中國之貿易額、佔輸出總額百分二·六四、為第十位、俱中國始終處於入超地位、因糖及煤汕等、均有大量自爪哇輸入也、至荷印之施行限制政策、自有其立塲、姑不必論、但無論如何、中國係居於不利地位、考察團惟一任務、雖取得進口許可證、方能接收定單、茲述進行情形如决、</p>
<p>荷印限制　貿易辦法</p>
<p>荷印政府鑒於外國貨品無限制之傾銷、使其母國商業地位、完全失去、雖國際間曾作種種談判、迄未成功、乃於一九三五年六月間、突然頒佈各種限制及准許輸入條例、共辦法係以一九二九至一九三三三五年間、各輸入商本身輸入商品之數量、作為准許輸入數量之根據、換言之政府根據輸入商所早報之五年間輸入量、山政府分配、給予許可進口數量、不幸僑胞在一九三三年以前、素少注意進口事業、大多購自歐商、而轉售於土人、因之華商失去自行進口之機會、因之經營商業、有不少困難、允有進者、荷印政府與各國間如英德等國、訂有貨物數量交換之條約、卽英國購自荷印若干貨品、則荷印同時須購自英國相等貨品、故每種貨物之限制條件、規定必須購自某某國家若干數量、其他則可自由向任何國家輸入、中國及日本卽在其他國家一類內日本貨品、雖與荷印尙無條約之訂立、但其價格低廉、中歐商入趨之若騖、因購歐洲貨非但無何利益、且有虧本之虞、購日貨則有利可圖、中國貨品則介於歐貨與日貨之間、競爭不易、但中國貨品、亦有可與日貨競爭者、進口商之自身許可數量用罄時、亦得再向政府申請特別許可證、中國與荷印旣未訂立商的、惟有根據此辦法以圖補救、考察團抵爪哇後、歐洲商行、亦表示種種好感、惟商人惟利是圖、但求價廉有利、固無所謂國界、故惟一希望、國內廠家能减輕成本、力謀競爭、則爪哇仍有良好市塲、而僑商對此、允為盼望、如國貨與日貨同樣價格、則常然購進國貨、毫無疑義、是有國內廠家之努力矣、</p>
<p>荷印經濟　部之意見</p>
<p>考察團團長高事恒、於九月五日特偕吾國宋總領事前往經濟部、作非正式之討論、對方出席者、為商的司司長史幹摩爾、商業司司長樸克、及首席秘書、常由高團長提出種種意見、略謂中國荷印間實際上有促進貿易之可能、而根據統計、荷貨每年向中國出超、則中國貨品、雖在雙方未訂立商的之前、有極端理由、可請荷印政府准予進口、謀雙方貿易之平衡、此次考察團雖承荷印政府之優渥待遇、而因限制問題、未准接受定單，故請對於某某數種貨物、頒給特別許可證、荷方答覆、謂在可能範圍內、當然努力實現、但有數種物品、必須自母國輸來、或荷印政府與其他國家已訂立條件、則事實有困難之點、荷印政府對於任何國家並不歧視、希望中荷印間、隨時有發展貿易之可能</p>

<p>限制進口　各種物品</p>

<p>該團十二　日赴星洲</p>
<p>該團與荷印政府交涉結果、據雙方口頭談話結果、甚稱圓滿、經濟部正預備用書面答覆、大致一切尙無問題、希望於南洋商業考察團來荷印後、雙方貿易關係、日趨增進、該團為酬答僑胞起見、特於八日晚假座大東酒樓宴答僑胞各界、到有宋總領事及各界來賓六十餘人、席間由高事恒團長致詞、力勉僑胞擁護中央、及與國內工商界取得聯絡、共謀國貨在海外之推銷、以荷印一百二十萬華僑之力量、必能獲相當成功、各商界領袖亦有答辭、該團一行於十二日搭輪赴新加坡、到埠送行者、有經濟部决長、荷印政府官員、吾國宋總領事、商會主席各界僑胞等百餘人、並贈送花籃、情况極為熱烈云、</p>

<h3>甘省來人談　邊陲希望投資懇殖　地曠人稀致啓外人覬覦　亡羊補牢亟宜乘機開發</h3>
<p>中央社云、各省市政當局、邇來鑒於境內失業者日漸增加、影響社會經濟與地方治安頗鉅、羣認為欲救濟此項失業恐慌、計莫善於將失業者、運往邊陲墾殖、蓋西北等邊陲境內、地曠人稀、邊陲當局、以及當地人士、亦均盼內地失業者、速往墾殖、中央社記者昨晤新自甘肅返滬之友人張君、承告各情如次、</p>
<p>地曠人稀　引人覬覦</p>
<p>張君供職於甘邊交通界達四年之久、工作之餘、曾留心考察該地民情風俗、據談、西北邊陲省份、面積廣大、數倍於東南各省、但人口稀少、較僻地段、恒步行數十里不見一人、土地因之荒蕪、滿地黃金、無人收拾、遂引起外人之覬覦、年來邊疆時起事變、共原因雖不一、然地曠人稀、引起外人之覬覦、則為其最大要素、且邊陲人稀、有違國防原則、故欲鞏固邊陲、首當鼓勵移民、</p>
<p>當地希望　投資墾殖</p>
<p>邊陲省區、因文化經濟之落後、深盼內地人士、前往投資開發、雖迭聞滬上銀行界呼喚投資內地口號、但尙未惠及邊陲、西北等地蘊藏之富、國人盡知、所以企盼上海金融界·實業界·前往投資甚切、同時該地人士、亦深知欲繁榮地方、當增加人口、東南等地、因市面不景氣、人浮於事、時閙失業恐慌、邊陲正患人稀、內地失業者前往墾殖、旣可解决失業恐慌、又可以繁榮邊區、鞏固國防、實一舉數得、</p>
<p>獲利既富　交通亦便</p>
<p>張君並謂、西北邊陲蘊藏旣富、宣於設立實業工廠、蓋邊陲貨物原料、價値甚微在該地製貨外銷、成本當可低賤不少、獲利定可豐富、且西北交通設備、年來亦逐漸發達、輸運方面、不致感受重大影響、內地人士如能結伴前往墾殖、地方當可日漸繁榮、交通設備、亦必隨之發達、可斷言也、若人人坐等邊陲交通便利後、始往投資墾殖、則邊陲永無開發之日、</p>
<p>目前要着　設詢問處</p>
<p>邊區民情風俗、與內地大同小異、移民前往、不致感受重大不便、為謀便利內地人士到邊區起　、鄙意當在上海南京等處設立詢問處、以供內地人士詢問、赴邊陲去種種事宜、如路程·費用·邊區民俗·生活情形等等、是項詢問處、當含有介紹性質、前往者在行前得此介紹、不致躊躇不前、同時並盼國營交通機關、對於邊睡去之人士、於路費等方面、予以優待辦法云、</p>

<p>江安</p>
<p>招商燭長江船江安輪、船內裝有平漢路聯運貨、由漢開滬、須到楊家渡新棧起卸、該輪在　停碼頭之際、適遇潮漲、（邇日正値大汎期）水急浪巨而遭壓迫、船身又因避讓浦江小船、致向楊家渡碼頭碰撞、當時將碼頭上之一二兩號浮橋撞損、出事後、昨已報告到局、總局已派員　碼頭勘騐、準備修理、</p>
<p>通和</p>
<p>大陸實業公司通和輪、在鎮江附近、與怡隆洋行神愛輪相撞、通和損壞甚巨、舵機之滑車巳傷折、前船身右邊螺絲盡鬆、刻巳擱停四天、派去技工、無法修理、前艙且巳進水、每小時的進一寸、船內裝鹽已受損壞、滬上續得電訊後、巳由大陸船務主任方君、親往鎭江勘騐、再商營救方法、船主為俄人維諾斯克夫、大陸公司、前因春和輪西人船主、改用國人黃亞君後、在技術上駕駛上均勝過西人、通和輪亦擬改用國人、不意已先肇禍、受重大之損害也、</p>

<h3>新秋足球第一聲　東華昨勝葡萄牙　結果四比一上半時二比一　路途遙遠觀眾寥寥千餘人</h3>
<p>東華足球會以西聯賽開賽在邇、為整飭師旅起見、特的西人勁旅葡萄牙隊、於昨日下午作友誼賽於市體育塲、此賽為本季第一次之新聲、但以路途遙遠、觀衆並不踴躍、總計不過千二三百人而已結果東華以四對一擊敗葡軍、足見東華陣容雖未完固、實力已相常銳利、俟孫賈歐遊歸來、陣綫更增雄厚、並聞東華已邀法商會、於下週六（二十六）作友誼賽於逸園云、昨賽戰情如下、</p>
<p>文奎頭攻</p>
<p>兩陣旣圓、以戰裳均屬白色、東華特加藍馬甲一件、以資識別、法官沈回春號令旣下、萄軍先攻開始、阻於中路、萬象華英勇不减當年、從葡軍手中截得來球後、沿邊直趨、勾中一脚、許文奎趕上正好、鐵頭一碰、　的入網、為東華隊首開紀錄、為時尙祗六分鐘也、</p>
<p>葡軍逞能</p>
<p>幾度回合、東華文繡慌忙攻門無效、不久雷米迪救球失脚、戴中鋒操之過急、一飛衝天、葡軍左路進軍、阿奎諾在底綫犯規、由莊維新執罰任意球、詎踢出未遠、球為恩達耶所獲、短遞中鋒、羅柴遼脚頭起處、橫飛而入、遂失一城、成一對一、</p>
<p>義臣立功</p>
<p>廿二分鐘時、戴麟經又匹馬獨入、頭攻未入、馮運佑接上再射、又未建功、疊次佳機、均失交臂、葡軍門前、滿佈東華鐵騎、混亂異常、義臣從中穿出、建功而回、東華以二比一勝上半時、</p>
<p>罰十二碼</p>
<p>列陣再戰、葡軍陣容大事更動、一度進襲、危險萬狀、幸安然渡過、旋東華全師反攻、萬許李三將相繼猛射、守門羅倫出而拒敵、因更調時未通知裁判、被罰十二碼、由戴麟經主踢、切橫木而中、</p>
<p>完成大功</p>
<p>此後戴中軍與葡中鋒羅石、各有一决猛射、均未奏效、互有險夷、均無進展、最後五分鐘時、戴麟經在敵門二十碼處獲一良機、脚頭起處、應聲入網、此球低而且急、羅倫撲地救護、竟從腰下穿入、不數分鐘、笛聲起處、東華遂以四對一取得最後勝利、</p>

<h3>上海日本學校概況（一）</h3>
<p>— 胡祖蔭</p>
<p>上海日本僑民在滬設立日僑小學四所，中學三所；共有學坐三千七百六十七人。本文對於日中小學各項設施，將作簡要介紹。筆者承日僑居留民團團長甘濃益三郎，書記細木信雄二君多方供給材料；又蒙中部日本尋常小學校校長石則之，日本高等女學校校長水口民次郎二君賜贈校舍照片各一張，均此誌謝！關於譯名一項，多承同事褚君應瑞擬定，亦併誌謝。</p>
<p>一，辦學沿革</p>
<p>日僑在滬興辦學校已有五十一年的歷史。在一八八五年，有一位屬於東本願寺的僧侶獨自創辦了一所日本學校，敎育在滬的日本兒童。這個學校乃是現在日本小學校的起源；那時入學的兒童不滿二十人，學校內的課程亦僅限於讀法，算術，和寫宇三項。</p>
<p>到了一九〇〇年，這所學校改為公立，更名為開導小學校；學生人數增加到五十人左右。五年後，此校收歸日僑所組織的社團辦理。到一九零七年，上海日本居留民團正式成立，該團乃接受興辦日僑學校的資任；這時學生的人數巳經增加到二百人左右。</p>
<p>近年來，旅滬日僑的人數逐漸加；日僑學校亦隨之添建。在本市的東區，西區和中區陸續有新校設立。現在共有日僑學校七所，學生總數有三千七百六十七人。這些學校都是由上海日本居留民團所管理，而由日本駐滬總領事監督。現將日僑各校的名稱，地址和設立年月調查抄錄如後：</p>
<p>上海日本學校名稱，地址及設立年月調查表</p>
<p>在滬各處的日僑部送他們的子弟進入日僑學校肄業，所以各校學生的人數都是很多。現將各校男女學生人數調查統計錄后：</p>
<p>上海日本學校男女學生人數統計表（一九三五年統計）</p>
<p>附註：在上列各校學生人數中，有華人女生二名，男生一名。</p>

<h3>河米去路尚覺良好</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源更稀、祇到十號左右、貨共近二千石、故新　尖市况更俏、行情加起　　尺、新羊尖亦為帶高幾分、新粳秀　角、至厚早破粳　因零銷平平、仍居定局、薄稻難有青島帮辦四百餘包、價亦無　榮辱、變元仍然相仿、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各貨到埠三十號左右、市上各色銷路、尚稱活絡、市價破粳高貨平疲、中次提昂幾分至一角左右、陳羊尖貨稀　定、新羊尖略形緊扣、新埠團客尖價加一角左右、西新粳價緊角許、東新粳無甚升降、</p>

<h3>粵銷客米甚為暢旺</h3>
<p>昨日客秈到銷兩旺、市氣甚佳、到頭前昨兩天又有一萬包左右、惟粵消甚活、且有一部份直接運銷、故市面並不受到頭湧旺影響、昨前新到各貨以機米為主、而糙米存到較少、適為粵帮暢辦、價乃立漲六七分至角外不等、其他機米　則均平正而已、統市開出湘米四千五百十包、贛米五千一百　十包、漢口沙市糙米　千一百包、台秈八十五包，由粵汕甬廈本　各帮分去、</p>
<h3>洋荘芝蔴到貨相接</h3>
<p>洋荘芝蔴前昨　十二元聞至十　元九角、成交六百　、昨市先做十一元九角、繼　　　元九角　分半、成交三百噸、後市續有買進故市況轉緊、但未開成交、刻下去路不脫徘徊之象、行情大　跟隨盤旋、因各地新貨源源可接、人心鑒於洋荘銷場、殊少興奮、東洋帮辦去沙市　千餘包、泉州帮　去毫州蔴一百零五包、其餘均為零星小數、山本街等辦去四百餘包、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲銷內外又復沉靜</h3>
<p>昨日海外絲市、又告微跌、（計紐約近期跌一分、遠期跌一分半、橫濱現期貨各跌八元）致申埠絲市、除信孚連納續有售開外、絲銷又復沉靜、用戶絲市、因悉今庚秋　僅七成收馈S商對目前絲市、咸持價看漲、未肯　售氏之內銷市情、亦因之　　觀時晚橫濱遠期回漲、及紐約交易所絲交尚不寂寞、（成交包額為一〇六〇包）則下週絲市、似能漸穩定、或有盤上可能云、</p>
<h3>紅茶有全部出售可能</h3>
<p>自皖贛紅茶總運銷處、對于市上剩存紅茶七千餘箱、擬議整個推銷計畫後、連日風聲所播、協和怡和錦降等洋行、及汪裕泰茶店、對此均非常注意、總合各方情形觀察、因汪裕泰能全部銷受及變通辦法、故買權比較有力、惟此事須從客方認可、聞今日祁浮至　路茶商、召集會議、討論對策、日內當可決定云、</p>
<h3>本週綠茶市況岑寂</h3>
<p>據茶棧公會報告云、本週綠茶、較呈清淡、查今年因市價平準、開盤以來、走銷頗暢、所以出口額較往年同時期超出一倍以上、至近數週來、到茶已稀、而存底又淺、且品質優良者、大都已被銷馨、以致所存各茶、外洋來電、對其售價發生問題、而買方對此亦有考慮之必要、所以市面暫形寂靜、所有交易僅為零星而已、計本週以白頭行進買熙較多、共計一千零三十箱、其他如抽珍僅二百八十箱、小針眉三百七十箱而已、平水茶大帮及另色各茶、亦久無市、現正與洋行方面討論、下週或可望較　活動云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　洋裝襯裏布銷路亦暢</h3>

<h3>糖市　提青片青俱見續升</h3>

<h3>未來的榮譽繫在誰的身上？</h3>
<p>— 齋夫</p>
<p>「九一八」國難紀念，又丟在我們的腦後了！</p>
<p>我們所當痛自省悟的：國恥並非一夕造成；也非一朝可以湔雪。只要看各人的身體，身體瘦弱的人，不是一天兩天的毛病瘦弱下去的。身體强健的人，也不是一天兩天鍛鍊起來的。</p>
<p>國家的積弱，不是一二人的罪過：是百年來全民族所積成的罪過。要湔雪國恥，不是現在或將來一二人的力量所能辦到。而須現在及將來積十年二十年以至百年中全民族共同奮鬥，方能奏效。</p>
<p>但看我們这次參加世運代表的得了「鴨蛋」而歸。我們認為是國家榮譽上一個很大的遺憾。可是這個遺憾，並不是由於我們的運動員在亞林匹克會塲上不肯努力。而根本由於我們「體力不如人」！所以在各種比賽中，每每起初還可一拚，而後來却不行了</p>
<p>有人說：「要在將來的世運會裏爭光，必須從培植民衆體格着手：至少須十五年方能見效。」所以未來的國家榮譽，繫於現在的小朋友們身上。‘從現在小學校的學生，好好訓練體格，經過十五年後，斷不會仍在世界運動會裏得個「鴨蛋」而歸。</p>
<p>豈但體育是這樣，我們國家所需要的人才是多方面的。小朋友們除了人人必須鍛鍊體格之外，還要從性之所近的任何方面認真磨鍊！</p>
<h3>準備</h3>
<p>— 婉文</p>
<p>人生在世，無論成人兒童，男子女子，生存一天，便有一天事務，待我們去做，這事不論大小，在未做以前，必要準備，才能實行</p>
<p>世間有許多微小而有益的事，都被忽略了，忘掉了，甚為可惜，如果能够利用，一定得益不少。小朋友們！你們不妨把準備試一試，證明我的話對不對。</p>
<p>我先把，準備和不準備後所得的結果比較一下；就說學校裏考試吧！如果考試以前溫習書本準備着，那么在考试时，不覺困難，因為都是溫過的熟書，卽使有一兩個問題不會，也無關緊要的，等到分數揭曉時，你的成績一定優良，至少名次也不會太後，如果考試以前不溫書準備着，只憑平日所聽到而看見的，你的腦中决不能記憶許多問題，在考試時，一定感到困難，於是有作弊的事情發生了，被敎師知道，非但成績劣，又失了人格，小朋友大概也得到這個經騐，希望你們向好的方面做去，就是事前的準備。</p>
<p>不過準備不是短時間所能敷衍，一定要充分的準備，直到十分純熟為止，這樣的準備，才能得到很大的效果，非短時間準備後的結果可比。</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們準備着甚麽呢？你們現在的讀書，就是準備着將來擔負國家的重任，年齡漸增，責任漸大，而準備愈重要，習醫的，準備服務翳藥界，讀師範的，準備服務敎育界，學習航空的，準備替國家加厚國防的力量，要知準備的基礎，全在你們兒童時代立定的。</p>
<h3>小遊戲</h3>
<p>— 陸昌藩</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們的屋簷下有沒有白鐵的水落？倘使有的話，小朋友便當這水落有些壞（量好不壞）的時候，你們得把這東西拿來做個趣味非常濃郁的玩意兒。</p>
<p>這東西的式樣一定要如第一圖的那個樣子。做成了這個樣子以後，你們便在第一圖的A處置一面鏡子，B處也置一面鏡子，這兩面鏡子要互相照着的。兩面鏡子放好以後，再用一個香烟罐蓋似的東西，中間鑿個圓孔，裝在C處，把你們任何一眼閉着，一眼向筒裏瞧，會看見筒外許多景物了。</p>
<h3>民族英雄祖逖</h3>
<p>— 增</p>
<p>祖逖是晋朝人，從小時候，便有大志，和他的朋友劉琨，感情極好，常常同床共睡。有一晚，祖逖半夜醒來，朦朧之間，忽聞報曉的鷄聲，一聲一聲地高呌着，他便連忙喊醒劉琨，說道：「天快亮了，你聽，這鷄聲多麽激昂」！劉琨聽了他的話，急忙起身，兩人摘下壁上的寳劍，同舞一陣。</p>
<p>不久，五胡亂華，晋室南遷，我國的北方，都在胡人勢力範圍之下。幸祖逖率了大隊人馬，向北進攻。當他渡江時，擊着楫，指着江水，很悲壯地發誓道：「祖逖不能肅淸中原，决不再渡此江」。意志是非常的堅决。後來竟把胡人打得大敗而逃，黃河以南，完全克復了。</p>
<p>小朋友們：你們努力吧；我願你們來做祖逖這一樣的民族英雄，收拾我國目前的殘局！</p>
<p>物理小常識</p>
<h3>出浴時的身體為什麽覺得冷</h3>
<p>— 何子祥</p>
<p>小朋友：天氣　了，或者工作勞動了：我們身上的汗腺會分泌一種液汁出來，這就是汁。出了汗，就該沐浴；不然，對於你的身體會有不良的影響的。</p>
<p>小朋友！在你出浴的時候，一定有這樣的　覺和疑問「為什麽身上覺得冷？」</p>
<p>出浴時，身上附　着水滴，水滴吸收熱量化氣上升，就到我們身上來奪取溫度；所以出浴時我們的身體就覺得冷</p>
<p>游泳時多吸空氣為什麼比較省力？</p>
<p>小朋友：你在暑假裏曾學習過游泳嗎？游泳是件很好的健身運動他有發述體魄，增進肺量幷能急救拯溺等功效，誠有學習的必要和價値。</p>
<p>凡是能游泳的人，都有這末一個槪念；「游泳時，吸人多量空氣，比較省力。」為什麼能够省力？小小朋友！我告訴你：</p>
<p>我們在游泳的時候吸入多量空氣，肺臟就隨着擴張，全身體積也隨着增加，浮力就大，幷且吸入的空氣重量很小：所以在游泳的時候就覺得省力了。</p>
<p>小朋友！在你學習游泳的時候，就可以證寳這話是不錯的。</p>
<h3>愛護動物園　蓮池中的鯉魚</h3>
<p>— 董遜</p>
<p>池中的睡蓮開了！</p>
<p>潔白的花朶，</p>
<p>碧綠的圓葉，</p>
<p>是多麼的美麗啊！</p>
<p>還有那一尾尾的鯉魚，</p>
<p>靑的·黑的·紅的·橙的；</p>
<p>游來游去，</p>
<p>是蓮池的主人翁哪！</p>
<p>弟弟·妹妹來到到蓮池畔，</p>
<p>魚兒浮上水面來歡迎，</p>
<p>把麩餅兒丟向水中，</p>
<p>讓牠們舞動魚嚐來追逐，</p>
<p>張了嘴「着波·着波」地吞食，</p>
<p>餅兒着了水，漸軟·漸沉，</p>
<p>鯉兒隨了餅，也潛下水底，</p>
<p>可是餅兒再投時，它們又浮上水面來。</p>
<p>妹妹說：</p>
<p>「餅兒丟一個又一個，拋一個又一個，</p>
<p>魚兒，魚兒你要留些神！</p>
<p>幸而我們不是釣魚人，</p>
<p>否則早早把你釣進簍中，帶回家裏去烹飪！」</p>
<p>魚兒游着好似說：</p>
<p>「世人都是壞良心，</p>
<p>只有弟弟妹妹是好人，</p>
<p>我們只吃你的小麩餅，</p>
<p>不嚐他人的釣鈎餅！」</p>
<h3>東北四省有些什麽？</h3>
<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>慘痛的「九一八」紀念日，一刹那已過去了，今年是五周年了。但常你們悲痛中，可曾想到日本為什麽要奪取呢？就是為了東北四省物產很富，是我國的命脈·那麼，對於「東北四省有些什麼呢」？這裏我便略略地寫一些在下面：</p>
<p>東北有那四省？遼寗，吉林，黑龍江，熱河。四省中面積，以黑龍江為最，熱河最小·遼寗省，面積的八十五萬方里，住民約一千三百四十餘萬，漢族最多，滿蒙族决之·吉林省，面積的八十八萬方里，住民不足六百萬·黑龍江省，面積的一百七十八萬餘方里，人口不過五百萬·熱河省，面積的五十八萬方里，人口約三百八十餘萬·前决本刊上董遜君說，日本面積只有十五萬二千三百餘方里，但東四省面積，共計有四百零九萬方里，大家比較起來，眞是天差地遠了·</p>
<p>（一）遼寗　本溪係產無烟煤，年產三十萬餘噸，烟臺無烟煤，日出只數百噸，撫順礦地延長五里，年產一萬一千噸以上，皆由本溪湖煤鐵公司經營·其他金，銀，滑石，石棉皆產之·長白山富於森林，人參為特產·遼河沿岸，產豆和高粱，沿海有魚鹽之利；野蠶產於岫岩至寬甸一帶</p>
<p>（二）吉林依蘭，寗安，密山，穆稜，東寗，汪淸，延吉，　春，　甸，磐石，為著名產金地·森林很多，毛皮產不少，貂皮，人參，和烏拉草為吉林三寳·高梁，豆，麥很多，密山產蜂蜜大宗，東北汪湖富於鹽·</p>
<p>（三）黑龍江　室韋金礦有四處，奇河金礦有八處，採金確總周在中興溝漢河余礦地東西約七十里，南北的四十里，採礦局在漢河老溝·呼瑪，餘慶溝，東南的一百二十里，有七處；北東西三百餘里，南北百餘里，皆產金，有十處，總局在太平溝·黑河金礦年出價値一千一百萬萬元以上，本省煤礦年產一百六十兆噸，單以札賚諾　年出二萬萬餘斤·大興安嶺森林而積三千方里，伊勒呼里森林八千方里，東興安嶺，森林六千方里，巴蘭一帶。農產豆為大宗，小麥决之，西部有鹽和牧蓄之利·</p>
<p>（四）熱河山金沙金產於承德，圍塲，平泉，灤平等縣，石棉產於朝陽及凌源，本省之煤，合計有九百三十兆噸，採礦由北票煤礦公司，鐵亦很富·</p>
<p>諸位小朋友！看了以上四省的富源，希望你們將來去收回它，才不辜負我做這篇文章的目的。</p>
<p>兒童作品</p>
<h3>觀「小男兒」兒童教育影片</h3>
<p>— 精勤小學六年級生林</p>
<p>在一個星期日的下午，天氣晴明清朗，靖兄就帶領着我與小妹六寳，同倒國泰大戲院去觀電影。</p>
<p>這日國泰所開映的是：「小男兒」，大凡愛讀本報的小朋友，都已在本報敎育新聞關內讀過了。這部兒童小說集，在美國的文壇上，是相當有名的，因此，小男兒在銀幕上由好萊塢十三個小明星聯合主演，亦打破了美國空前的紀錄，眞是表演得生動活躍。</p>
<p>「小男兒是以最動人的故事，最深刻的描寫，最天眞的演出」。這句話是不錯的，舉幾個例來說，奈迪介紹入校，驚喜以至感泣，這個畫面，在我們幼稚天眞之兒童的純潔情感，是多麼的吻合啊！後來他們玩馬戲以及戲吸烟二個引起孩子相互惡鬥的穿挿，也可從歡樂的境地，使我們轉入於悲慟緊張之中。又有一段就是唐恩替好友得錢，置於原地，而被斥責，這是很可動我們熱烈的高潮，直到唐恩出走了，狄克生病死了，以及下葬的一段，尤其是使人哀痛欲絕。</p>
<p>故事就是這樣的完結，總之「小男兒」的這部書，「小男兒」的這部影片，就是我們小學生的世界，希望諸位親愛的小朋友們趕快去熟讀這部在本報所發表的「小男兒」，因為內容豐富，很有敎導我們於良善的意義的。</p>
<p>童子軍信箱</p>
<h3>野營的秘訣　答北平周桂蓮姑娘</h3>
<p>你參加臥佛寺夏令營所遭遇着的事情，我們細細地想了一想，那完全由於你不是個女童子軍，所以鬧了許多笑話。現在我們來告訴你吧。</p>
<p>你說「每天晚上營門都關不緊，露了很大的縫，鐵進許多蚊子和白蛉子，咬得臂上四十多處傷口。」那完全要怪你們自己起初紮營帳時，為什麼不先把營門扣好，再下樁呢？因為你把樁支得太遠，營門自然要露縫嘍。你的傷口現在還沒有好麽？這又要怪你自己為什麼在露營時，不帶一隻小的急救箱，明知夏天的白蛉子和蚊子討厭，卽便住在家裏阿摩尼亞香酒也必需備的呀！</p>
<p>本來露營時，非不得巳，千萬不可把營帳紮在樹林裏，因為就是天晴了，樹葉上的雨點子滴在營帳上，和還在落雨似的。大概你的朋友沒有騙你，只下了牛夜雨，你却以為下了一夜，就是因為你的營帳在林子裏，並不是你的神經上有了毛病。</p>
<p>露水會濕了你的被？我們有點不相信，我們十幾年來，露營了不知多少决，用的營帳有時還不是像你們用的厚番布哩，可是從來沒有濕過蓋在身上的被，卽便是在雨地裏。我先問你，（一）的營帳撑得挺麽？絲毫不縐麽？否則是會因為水量積在縐處或不挺處而滲透進來，結果就漏了，（二）你是不是牢牢地記住？不使頭，手指或任何東西去碰營帳的布？假使犯了，就難怪露水要濕了你的被。因為你碰了營布，那布的毛頭或細—纖維—被的弄順了，因此帳外積的水珠，便會順源而下地滲進來，自然要漏了。</p>
<p>因為時間和篇幅的關係，我不能盡量地在此地和你談。不久我們再直接給你一封信，談些你所提及的小問題吧。</p>
<p>我們當然歡迎你願意跟我門做朋友的請了，祝你健康！　中國童子軍自助社謹覆</p>

<h3>山中七姊妹（一）</h3>
<p>— 心青</p>
<p>在英國威斯莫倫山中，有一條又小又狹的山峽。名呌白蘭覃峽。它的腳下橫着一個碧綠可愛的山谷和一片格於斯美湖。山澗中的水滔滔不絕地流下來，從北面的山谷一帶流到湖裏。在北面又有美麗的山谷名四依斯台，四面都是高高的山，到處長滿着綠綠的草，只為常有一羣羣的羊在那裏吃草，所以那草又柔軟又光滑，直好像人家花園中的草地一樣，並且在春初的時候，草已生得齊齊整整的，似乎舖着綠絨的大地毯，道是別處的山坡上所比不上的。在依斯台的一端，有一座小小的村落，就呌做格拉斯美村，在別的一端，一帶斜斜的高坡，直通到一個被高山包圍着的小山峽中，四面都沒有出路，只有一角崎嶇不平的低坡，可以通到依斯台。另有一條彎曲而很危險的小徑，在山上經過六英里而到達蘭台山頭，這一個寂寞的山峽名呌遠依斯台，峽上立着一所小屋子，就呌做白蘭覃峽。屋子上面的山石上有一條裂縫，外面有一個水潭，先前一定是有水的，可是如今早已乾涸了。</p>
<p>住在這小屋子裏的是一位誠實的老軍人，名喚喬治葛林。他在山中開闢了一座小小的農塲，娶了一個活潑而勤勞的婦人做他的妻子。伊善於理家，把這小家庭弄得井井有條要是天氣晴朗，山路易走的日子，伊總得給伊的子女們打扮得很齊整，送他們上學校云。</p>
<p>在　八〇七年的冬天，蘭台山頭一座田莊裏，正在拍賣許多家具，山中的居民每逢人家拍賣，那就認為天大的大事情的；四山的人往往遠道而來，彼此很客氣的招待着，借此可以做各種的買賣，而多時不見的老朋友，因此也可以會會面談談心了。喬治葛林和他的妻子山蘭，當然也不能例外，他們就在這一個晴朗的冬日，淸早出發到那田莊裏參與拍賣去，而把他們的山屋子和六個小兒女都交給那長女安葛妮照顧，可是伊也只有九歲，本來照顧不了什麽叵耐他們家裏和田間不雇用僕人和佃夫，而近邊又沒有鄰舍，所以只得將這一家的重任，放在那九歲的女孩子肩上了。</p>
<p>小安葛妮倒也是一個極安定極精細的孩子。這一天白天裏安然的過去，並沒有發生什麽意外的事情，但是到了向晚的時候，濃霧罩滿了四山，空氣也頓時窒塞起來，分明是　示有大風潮　襲來了。那些孩子們很懇切的守望着他們的父母回來，可是那一天濃霧遮斷了他們的視綫，而一片片的雪開始降落一來，天色也早已烏黑了。</p>

<h3>怎樣應付「吃講茶」？</h3>
<p>— 忻規方</p>
<p>「吃講茶」，這是個切口語，所謂「切口」，是有類乎古書所說江湖上的好漢「老朋友們」所常用的流行術語。在上海前幾年，遇見有和「老朋友們」交涉的事，如果略有糾紛而小能立時解决，那必然是要的到一個地方去「吃講茶」。這是含有「講」開算數；「茶」以敬客之意。原意並不壞，而且是一椿極端和平的手段，要把大事化為小事，小事化為無事。在那的定的地方（多半是「老朋友們」常去坐的茶樓上，如本市的一樂天，日昇樓，靑蓮閣之類，又　南滬北街上常見的什麼「四海昇平茶樓」等，也是在數的茶樓）大家坐下來，擺了蓋碗茶　　壺茶杯，彼此先略　招呼一下，便邊喝茶，邊講理。不過，流風日下，在以前是很少有呌　謾駡，在呼亂跳的，而晚近則未免有太不拘形跡等情事，而且所謂糾紛，又常常會是藉端尋事的「拆梢」，「敲竹槓」等舉動，使人頗為「老朋友們」可惜，而無論南北市或特區的常局，也有「禁止講茶」的牌示，高掛各茶樓了。</p>
<p>在目前，「吃講茶」的事情也常常在有着。不過，有的是在旅館，飯店一：摩登些的甚至也有到小跳舞塲在茶舞時間去聚會的。因為恐怕觸犯刑章，所以非常顧忌，外人雖走過旁邊，也往往看不出那是在「吃講茶」。僅只看見一般人不免有交頭接耳，切切私議之態而已，</p>
<p>前面說過，「吃講茶」本是為解决糾紛而起意的，所以，如果僅是參加「吃講茶」，那這件事倒並不算怎樣嚴重，也决不致於要大家拚個你死我活，如仇敵們地鬥毆起來。因此，應付這「吃講茶」並非難事。卽使是被「拆梢」一藉端尋事」，這也不算大事。在「老朋友們」或白相人，有時因為誤會，有時因為「借重」，而「看相」你老哥這「洋盤」、卽是江湖上指非江湖，非「門裏」人之謂，又稱「空子」，謂其非靑，紅帮中門徒也），但他們相沿以來的例規是可以束縛他們使其適可而止的（卽所謂「識相」）。「借重」老哥的無非是一頓吃喝，俗稱「拉檯子」；或是「帮襯」，卽求助於你，請你破費點錢之意；並且還大家藉此交個朋友。所以，他們在剛剛要約　吃講茶」時，必定要先問你：『有老朋友嗎？』你這時如果能說得出幾個老朋友名字（不過，你要佔量平常是否有交情，如果沒有交情，决不可隨便亂拉亂扯，否則，事情更要弄得壞起來），說得淸交情的够不够，那這事情便好辦了。往往可以當時片言而决：卽使不决，到了的定上「茶會」（「老朋友們」常常聚集之茶樓）時，你如果的了你所認識的「老朋友」同去，一個兩個人無所謂，大家「切口」一對，便可立時言歸於好。否則，只消你那老朋友有個吩咐（這要面子稍大的），或者派兩個小夥　到塲，因為　中人在地方上是各有地段的，交情够的，當然無論那裏都跑得開（所謂「四海」朋友「兜得轉」的人物，南至龍華，北至吳淞，隨便那裏我來看你，你來看我，全行）。否則「光棍不擋財路」，管開事要　淸楚理路。此外你還應當要用點間接的手校。有時兩個資格老，門下多的「老頭子」，也不妨碰面一下，當血解釋誤會，這便是「老朋友」和「老朋友們自我的「吃講茶」。所謂「兄弟閱於牆」的情事，在現在也很多，但那與外界關俘極少，所以本文恕不多贅了。</p>
<p>「好漢不吃眼前虧」，這句話是誰也聽得進的，本文的意思便是想告訴你：如果你不幸而遇到這突如其來的事件，應如何應付？在前面，我講到有老朋友的易於解决的話。但是，沒</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>沒有老朋友的怎麼辦呢？那唯一方法便是臨機應變了。因為，如果白相朋友要對你大不客氣，他是用不着約你到茶會了。到茶會還是客氣。你不妨也暫忍着一時的怨氣，一點不露聲色，或者更是落落大方，和顏悅色的同他們周旋一下。你不妨旁敲側擊地把他們想對你要求的事，引得他們說出來。因為有時候他們也顧面子，不說什麼銀錢吃喝而要講理，但這是他們暗示着要你自己設法把文章做到正題，你就把牠做正題去好了。自然，你如果有老朋友，又當別論，因為你結交朋友也少不了銀錢吃喝呢。做到正題，話要說明在先：你不妨講講世界不景氣，生意沒有市面，雖承老朋友看得起，無奈是力量薄弱，當然，老朋友的一番好意不敢推托，還望老朋友多多原諒等等。一方面你觀察軋你去去的那般人的勢派，如相貌，打扮，言談等等，再細看他們中間，無形中是以那一個為領導者，或者總是異口同聲等等。你便隨機應變地尋找容易下台的步驟。總之，決不可動肝火；或者是言語吞吐，格格不能成辭，露出全付弱者神氣。必須軟中帶硬，硬中帶軟，留心觀察，順口應對。他們如果已很明白你的經濟環境，又見你不是鄉愚，而且言談舉止十分來得，他也會感到無理取鬧不是方法，而逐漸同你開誠佈公起來。同時，為了佩服你的這種大無畏的精神，臨事不慌不忙，勇敢伶俐等等，也會勾起他們江湖上好漢的義氣和血性來，雖然有時銀錢吃喝也會把他們這種義氣和血性掩蓋的。你看出了這種情景，那便是機會到了，你必須抓着這一點進攻，表示：『大家「一回生，二回熱」，雖過去沒有軋過老朋友，情願從這一天起結交幾位』等等。我想，這一套話，對所謂「洋盤」「空子」們，用以對付「老朋友」，是非常相宜，有益無損的。古諺有云：「你先自認不是，人家不好怪你；你先睡在地下，人家誰好打你。」對於應付「吃請茶」更要一復斯言。如果要想根本避免這些麻煩，那是只有在乎平時自己行為的約束，不致使人有隙可乘為上了！</p>

<h3>絲廠管車須知選繭和煮繭</h3>
<p>— 理真</p>
<p>當一個絲廠的管車員，就要懂得一般的工廠管理法，如對於工人的各種個性，督率和指導的方法等，但這是管理任何工廠都須知道的事情，不獨管理絲廠為然；其次就是要知道繅絲之一般的技術，如繅絲湯之温度，繅絲鍋的容水量，持繭法，索緒法，絲量之增進法，製絲能率之增進法等，都是絲廠管車應全部通曉的。但這些都已成了專門的問題，內容非常複雜，不便在這兒介紹，我現在所要談的，是當管車的人首先要知道的一種工作，這就是選繭和煮繭。其餘的，是你作了多年的管車後，自然就漸漸會知道的。</p>
<p>在沒有進機械化的絲廠之先，我們已經在鄉間習得一些原始的繅絲法了，如煮繭，烘繭，繅絲，添緒等等。那時的方法都非常陳舊而簡單，不適於現代工廠之用，就是那半機械化的手工業工廠之絲廠，大體上還是陋就簡，未盡採用因科學方法，用不着專門的知識和技術。可是現在就不同了，繅絲中之選繭和煮繭已成了我們的專門知識之一了。</p>
<p>選繭的精細和粗忽對於絲量工程影響極大。薄皮繭，綿繭，關係於　度的整齊。死籠繭，污繭（俗稱血繭），關係於生絲的品質。這是非常重要的事體。但是管車者亟應嚴格的警戒：一般選繭者之心理，只認為同功繭，污繭，死籠繭才是關係於繅絲之品質，而把牠選出去，對于綿繭和薄頭繭則不大留意。如這樣，則不管煮繭法是怎樣的完全，但是要與良繭同樣的解舒，是絕對不可能的，因之結果減絲量，多切斷，粗細不勻。參觀過日本絲廠的人就知道，他們的繭種比我們的優良，但是選繭反而比我精們細，是這値得我們取法的。</p>
<p>但是究竟那些繭種為我們所應選出去的呢？那就有死籠繭，同功繭，不正形繭，簇付繭（繭外面有柴印，或板形俗稱柴印繭），污繭，蛆　繭，綿繭（此種繭，其絲層結構不良，煮時容易過熱，多生縺泡，最為不良），榧子形繭，光頭繭，薄頭繭（此種繭是由于　兒在多濕或空氣中多含炭素而苦于呼吸之時所織成的，頂頭開一明窗，繅絲時成為湯繭）。</p>
<p>如繅稍粗織度之絲，更當注意薄皮繭，綿繭和小形繭。反之，繅略細織度之絲，如把大形繭　選出，反而便　　　。對于絲品之色澤影響最大的，要數死籠繭和污繭所繅成的絲和絲片。我國的絲的色澤遠不及日本，而價値也相差很大，就是不留意絲之污一斑所致。</p>
<p>煮繭的目的是要使絲軟和溶解，才好依順序抽出，而一方面又才好使幾縷絲相全成條，有些是十四條絲而有些則為二十一條絲（即由十四縷合成一股，或二十一縷合成一股），因之煮繭須高温湯。絲縷外面有一種粒狀絲膠，受熱湯作用，一部分溶解于熱湯中，一部分則軟化而膨脹，使絲縷之膠着者離解。因湯媒之溶媒不同，而絲膠之溶解度亦有快慢。</p>
<p>在煮繭時我們應該知道下面的事項：第一是煮繭的分量。着重絲的品質的，可以略少，不重品質而重能率的，可以略多。但優良煮工，他可煮繭略多，這是他的能率大的緣故。容易舒解的繭（春繭）略多，否則略少。繭量輕的秋繭與過亁燥繭可以略少。總之，煮繭分量之多少，大概是一斗繭分做十次或十二次煮之。</p>
<p>煮繭機內的水量，離上緣五分上下。容繭哭的上緣，以不露出空中為度。又，朝上煮繭機內之水或湯，供給八分，然后送入蒸氣。但這時的湯因受蒸氣壓力，容量為之膨脹，再加進了蒸氣在冷水中冷却的蒸溜水，而煮繭器內之水便充滿了。這樣的湯量之多少，對于繭動搖，蒸氣壓力之變化，湯的溷濁，熱之經濟等，都有影響。</p>
<p>又要注意煮繭湯的濃度。煮繭湯裏面所含的成分，就是用水中原有的成分和隨着煮繭回數之增多而漸次浸出於煮繭湯中之成分，如絲膠，蛹體浸出物的蛋白質，脂肪質以及各種無機成分。煮繭湯的濃度漸增，水　電離子的濃度也漸增，而成為酸性。所以湯中的濃度增加，繭層絲膠的溶解愈少，繭的舒解惡而絲量有逐漸增加之傾向。煮繭湯與繅絲湯，其中所加之舒解劑與增絲劑的分量，也要跟着煮絲湯與繅絲湯之濃度而有多少變更。因之煮繭湯之濃談清濁必須適度。但這也是要看繭質如何而定的。</p>
<p>其次是煮繭的温度：煮繭的温度，因煮繭的時間和繭質而有不同。煮繭分為前煮部，滲透部和後煮部三種，前煮繭部（即高温部）是在華氏寒暑　　度內外，滲透部（即　温部）在一四　度內外，後煮繭部在一九　度內外。其時間之百分比，則前　者合為百分之三十五，後煮為百分之六五。</p>
<p>上面已經說到，煮繭時間有高温度時間和低温度時間，前者短而後者長。如繭質良好，絲膠易於溶解，而乾燥度大，造煮繭湯淡時，則可縮短煮繭時間。反之，亦可加長。不過我們應注意的，是煮繭時間愈短，危險也愈大。過長也是一樣。</p>
<p>此外還有煮熟繭之保護，煮　繭之處理以及煮繭用的蒸氣壓力等，須得加以注意。現在我們可以把煮繭上一般應留神之點提出。蒸氣壓力不可驟高驟低，如當早上或値晚上以及暴風雨時，更宜當心。繭容器和繭容器之間隔，以一寸至八分為適當。煮繭前，先把空容器三四只，連續進入湯中，然後再連續收入盛繭容器，而行煮繭。煮繭前須細察機械各部有無障礙。煮繭終了，定要掃除消潔。要注意煮熟程度，又須保持有一定程度的煮熟繭，以供給繅絲者。此外如湯温的　濁，分量，桶温的温度等亦均當注意。</p>
<p>名人訪問記</p>
<h3>杜重遠談獄中生活</h3>
<p>— 趙緒</p>
<p>我很欣幸，這次在有意的無意中唔見了杜重遠先生。怎麼說是有意呢？當「杜先生恢復自由」的消息傳出後，我料到這時的全上海新聞界必然照例的一大夥兒去訪問；杜先生必然也是照例的托病不見。所以我便有意地不去湊熱鬧，我除了打一個電話問一問虹橋療養院院長丁惠康兄而外，我便致函本周刊編者請教「我和杜先生不期而遇」的方法。他給我想了一條妙計，果然，不出五天，便和杜先生遇見了。是在他和朋友們歡敘的午餐時。</p>
<p>杜先生是一位三十多歲年紀的人，身材很魁梧，但態度非常和靄，面頰上常帶着笑容。口音是遼寧語帶點北平官話，談吐嘹亮而流利。當他的一位親戚替我介紹時，他似乎限定了範圍似的說：「我希望不要把我這很平常的遭造當成重要事故去描寫它！」</p>
<p>我連忙表示：「我不過要知道你獄中的生活情形而已」。</p>
<p>在這範圍以內，我們的談話便繼續下去。</p>
<p>「聽說最初你是　　　　」河涇江蘇第二模範監獄，以後因病　求交保，經高二分院指定改押虹橋療養院診病。這樣說起來，您在獄中不過幾月，其餘的時間便都是臥病醫院了，是嗎？」我開始問他。</p>
<p>「在第二監獄只有四五個月，不錯！杜先生說：「不過，在醫院時，也派有警長警探數人看管我的。」</p>
<p>這時，杜先生的一位親戚又告訴我：「當他押在漕河涇時，他的夫人侯御之女士便把　　　　　　　　　　　　家祠　　（　　　相近），以便隨時送點飲食雜物給他。一方面又奔波友朋間設法營教，並向最高法院提起抗告。抗告結果，並經最高法院裁定准予上訴並停止執行徒刑。在上訴期間，仍暫押第二監獄。不過，因為是「聽候查辦」，並非已決罪犯，所以待遇還好。」</p>
<p>杜先生　「您在第二監獄裏的生活情形如何？」</p>
<p>「除了吃飯睡覺以外，不過看看書。」杜先生說：「不過，我在未入獄以前，生活是太沒有秩序了：每天沒有一定的時候吃飯；也沒有一定的時候睡覺。入獄以後，吃，睡都有規定時刻，所以，反覺得大可藉以休養。」</p>
<p>「看些甚麽書呢？」</p>
<p>「我因為覺得以前做事，雖血氣，勇氣，都不能算壞；只是還少精密計算。所以在獄中便專看經濟書籍。」</p>
<p>「看書以外呢？」</p>
<p>「自由運動的時間也自行規定了一下，把牠當作為一門功課。」</p>
<p>「那末在甚麼地方舉行的呢？」</p>
<p>「本來，如果是　　決定」</p>
<p>—當局允許杜至虹橋療養院養病時，杜（有○者）笑容可掬—</p>
<p>—漕河涇江蘇第二監獄內杜曾被囚處高牆之中，另有天井，因天氣炎熱，並搭有蘆蓆天篷—</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>了罪而問其他的罪犯在一起，那當然是要按照監中規定的時刻，和他們一同去運動。　　，所　押的地方是另一個單獨監房，這間屋子的外面有個天井。那可真算天井，因為牠是四面被高牆圍繞着。我便是在那天井中活動。」</p>
<p>「平常是不是老被關在監子裏呢？」</p>
<p>「沒有！因為那時我是未决犯。並且，還承親友們不　：一方請未監獄當局另眼相看；一方便有人送我睡椅一把，以資坐臥；又有人送我一只養在籠中的八哥兒，那八哥能呌會說，可以解我寂寞，而且馴伏異常，你有時放牠出籠，牠　也不會逃走的。」</p>
<p>這時，他的一們親戚又說了：「最初，人家送了這个「籠中鳥」給他，我們還怕他觸景生情而更難受，誰曉得他倒很愛這鳥。」</p>
<p>杜先生笑着說：「這就算是同病相憐吧！」</p>
<p>「我聽說杜先生所住的單獨監房，本是預備給從前著名的國際政治犯「牛蘭」住的，以後，他沒有來住，便很空了一些時。」</p>
<p>「這話我沒有聽見說過。」杜先生的親戚接下去：「不過我曾經聽見說是住過一個外國大的。」</p>
<p>「那里的設備比普通監獄不同嗎？」</p>
<p>「也沒有甚麽不同！」杜先生的親戚又說，「只不過在那天井中搭了一個天棚，以禦烈日。房中出具也有些是新添置的，並許自己多帶點食物書籍小用具等。」</p>
<p>「常有人到獄中去看杜先生吧？」</p>
<p>「左不過是他的夫人和他夫人的北北及最密切的親戚們而已，並且也是要得監獄當局特許才能去。還要照規定時間，去留不能隨意的。」</p>
<p>「能夠一直到他監房裏去嗎？」</p>
<p>「經特許後，可以到他監房的天井中會晤。」</p>
<p>「每天的飯菜如何呢？」</p>
<p>「這也是經特設後由　　製好了送交監中，經檢查後拿到監房裏吃的。」</p>
<p>「杜先生每天甚麽時候入睡，甚麽時候起床？」</p>
<p>「每天監獄裏有起床號吹着，聽見號音便起身，到吹熄燈號時，也必須熄燈入睡了」。杜先生回答。</p>
<p>「你是甚麽時候保到虹橋療養院去的呢？」</p>
<p>「那是在最高法院裁定准予上訴之後，天氣也寒冷起來了，我患傷風咳嗽很利害，便由家屬請求交保診病，得到當局許可後就去的。」</p>
<p>「在虹橋療養院的生活狀況如何？」</p>
<p>「起初是診病，醫病；後來便繼續養病。生活的規律完全依照醫生的吩咐。診病時書已沒有看了，一天只是服藥，休息，安睡，吃些滋養東西。稍復原後，才開始看看書報，散散步，會會親友。」</p>
<p>「比在監裏自由嗎？」</p>
<p>「也差不多。不過飲食較方便，散步可以在大洋台上，草地上。雖有一位警長侯君時常相伴着，但環境是換了一個幽美的郊外療養院，自然是感到舒適得多。」</p>
<p>「探望的人可以自由行動嗎？」</p>
<p>「也不能的。必須要得到警長的許可，而且要和他同在一起，　　　　　　　　　　敘談。」</p>
<p>「杜先生到九江去幹什麼呢？」</p>
<p>「這是報紙上的傳言吧？」</p>
<p>杜先生說：「大約因為我以前辦瓷器事業，所以有這一說？不過，我現在身體可說還未復原，我還想在　　靜養一些時再說。」</p>
<p>「杜先生的瓷業公司發達嗎？」</p>
<p>「入獄以前，在東北的已收歇了，在九江的目前也在停頓中，恐怕以后要大加整理才行。」</p>
<p>「聽說杜先生要到內地如湘贛粵等處去游歷，有這意思嗎？」</p>
<p>「　　　　聽見我親友中有人想約我到杭州　　，并代我　到我如果要到九江，不如從浙贛　走走等傳說，而　生這樣的　測吧？我自己實在沒有打定主意。」</p>
<p>隨後，我聽見杜先生親戚說：為了杜先生入獄而趕到上海的他的內弟侯君，已經轉學在上海某中學：杜先生在　西的住宅，也沒有退租。他的夫人侯女士因為辛苦積勞，也曾患過病，現在病　痊癒，但身體還很衰弱，大概暫時總不致遠行吧？</p>
<p>我那天和杜先生談了話後，因事便走了，可惜我沒有來得及看見他和他的親友們盡歡而散的情形，但他給我的印象却已夠深了。</p>
<p>世界珍聞</p>
<h3>野兎為害</h3>
<p>— 運</p>
<p>在澳大利亞的牧場上有一種小灌木，其樹葉是在乾旱期中羊的主要食品。但同時這種樹葉却又是野兎的美好食物，如果沒有它，在乾旱期中，無數野兎便要不能生存了。這樣，野兎便成為了這地方最有害的東西。該地科學產業研究評　會為了撲滅野兎，曾集中全力發明了一些最有效的方法，但結果仍不能將它滅絕。據調查，這地方為了驅除野兎，每年要費百萬鎊；由於野兎荒廢牧場，羊毛羊肉的收獲要減少一億鎊。同時，捕獲的野兎，其皮肉每年輸出國外的，僅値百萬鎊。兩相比較，損害實大，所以該地人士對於野兎深感痛苦。據他們的估計，如果能將野兎除去，那該地羊的產量將要比平時增加百分之二十五呢！</p>
<p>常識</p>
<h3>山珍海錯和健康</h3>
<p>— 可</p>
<p>都市的闊人常喫珍　美味，飲補血的葡萄酒，但他們不是身體虛胖，便是面色蒼白，很少有康健的。鄉村的農民常喫玉麥白蒼，青菜　　，但他們大都身體壯健，沒有病態。又都市的　明人有喫不完的山珍海錯，但不幸的是常患胃病。鄉村和城市的粗魯人有許多也患胃病，但那胃病不是不能消化，而是　子室虛，沒有東西來消化。依據這樣的事實，我們便可得出兩個結論：第一是常喫好東西不一定能使身體康健；第二是喫得太飽和喫得不飽都要發生病態，而這病態却是當前的時代病的特點之一。</p>
<p>據美國某其名醫學博士報告，最近有一位實業家患了種怪病，那病的現象是在每日午前十一時他必要陷入於非常的睡眠狀態；在睡眠中無論怎樣　喧動　，他都不會醒來。有好幾次他自駕汽車行經熱鬧的地帶，都因中途病態發作，睡眠過去而發生危險。這樣的怪病經過了許多名醫的考察，都不明其原因。後來才特別調查他的飲食，結果知道他每朝必食奶油和咖啡，於是醫生便命他停止喫奶油，而怪病也就漸漸痊癒了。還有一個大學生，得了一種全身疼痛的疾病，什麼事情也不能做；起初還以為這是精神病，但後來却判明了也是由於常喫好東西所引起的。因為他每天必要喫二四個雞蛋，以致食而不化，所以結果便得了那樣的重病。</p>
<p>經濟往來</p>
<h3>德國的石油問題</h3>
<p>— 充</p>
<p>正在努力準備戰爭的「第三帝國」，在它的戰時經濟的發展中，最重大的一個問題便是戰時的燃料問題，石油問題。</p>
<p>德國雖是強大的重工業國家，但它却沒有良好的石油根據地。最近柏林公布了一件文件，指出在一九一四年第一次世界大戰發生時，因為沒有特別重視石油問題，所以在大戰末期這問題使德國當局深感痛苦；但在當時出於強化石油精及石炭液化生產物的採取，由於戰時購入羅馬尼亞所產的石油，還能使問題得到相當的和緩。現在呢？實際情形可根本不同了。據柏林專門家的計算，德國陸軍的戰時編制有三百個師團，就中三十師團有一萬四百架坦克車和運貨汽車，有九千架飛機和裝置飛機場及防空設備的機械化師團。海軍軍艦的排水量和水上飛機有五十至六十萬噸。這樣，德國戰時所需燃料每攫便當在千二百萬噸以上了。然而德國國內燃料生產額在一九三四年只有八十五萬噸，去年也不過增加至百十萬－百十五萬噸。這樣大的需要和生產之差，便充分表現出了當前德國石油問題　比上次大戰時要嚴重很多。</p>
<p>目前，德國正在戰爭準備的開展時期，汽車和運貨汽車等的生產都在日益增加。據統計，汽車的生產在一九三二年是四萬三千四百架，至去年便增加到了二十萬一千四百架；運貨汽車的生產在一九三二年是八千架，至去年便增加到了三萬八千八百架。此外如飛機、坦克車的生產也有很大的增加。這樣，德國的燃料需要額當然也就成為了日益增加的形勢。</p>
<p>戰爭一旦發生，交戰　間的商業關係將會完全斷絕，作為重要軍用物品的石油當然要被禁運。德國本國的石油生產既是那麼　弱，而需要又是那樣巨大，如果戰爭發生，國外的石油輸入發生問題，那「第二帝國」的汽車和坦克車便將無法轉動，飛機也不能高飛，戰艦的全部動員也要感到困難，這是多麼可怕的危險啊！因此，國社黨政府近年來用盡種種方法來增加石油生產以圖德國石油能自給自足。這我們可以具體提出幾點來談論：</p>
<p>第一是原油的採取。自一九三四年以來，德國政府即努力擴大石油產地　　。這年由政府支出了巨額的補助金，新增了五十四個油井，面積達五十三公里；以後更增加到了八十五井，擴大面積到了九十九公里。到去年十月又發現了許多新的石油產地，這當然更擴大了石油產地的面積。結果，德國在去年的原油生產比一九三三年幾乎要增加一　（編者按：一九三三年的生產是二十一萬九千噸，一九三五年是四十三萬噸）。</p>
<p>但是，這樣的原油生產的增加是耗費了很大代價的；而且，這些原油的品質只適宜於精製塗抹油，作燃料則不甚適合。所以結果雖然數量增加，但對於正在展開戰爭準備的德國却是沒有多大益處的。</p>
<p>第二是石油精及其他焦煤化生產物的生產。現在德國有四千萬噸的褐炭生產都是用於這中間的。據胡羅台博士的計算，在理論上當可從中採取　百六十萬噸的黑色鑛油，並可從中取出九十六萬噸的石油精，二十萬噸的燃料黑色鑛油，五萬噸塗抹油等。但理論的計算一移到實際的實行時，但發生許多的困難了。結果只不過在燃料生產上增加些小的數字，根本還談不到問題的解决；同時，由於這種人工的方法之勉強施行，　用過大，更增加了戰時預算，使國家財政更加發生問題。</p>
<p>第三是努力石炭液化。這種辦法經過了許多困難，現在才算有些成效。因此，德國軍部對於石炭液化油的生產抱着很大的希望，幻想這能解决德國的燃料問題。但是，就最近的情形看來，那幻想恐怕要永遠成為幻想的。如在石炭液化中所需的各種化學品和原料的問題，先就不能獲得順利的解决。</p>
<p>總之，在目前情形下，只要是可以採取石油，生產燃料的辦法，德國政府都要努力去嘗試。如努力生產酒精和瓦斯等，就是在相增加燃料的供給。但每一種人工製造燃料的辦法都要發生生產費過高的問題；這樣生產費過高的生產品，在德國市場上當然不能和外貨競爭。因此德國政府便特別用關稅來保護本國石油。但這樣一來，「第三帝國」的關稅收入却受了很大的損失；同時，由於德國需要大量的石油，所以就是它本國的石油生產年有增加，就是以關稅來保護國產石油，但近年來仍有大量的石油輸入德國。據統計，德國燃料輸入在一九三三年是二百六十五萬噸，及至去年時，更增加至三百七十七萬噸了；本年的統計數字當然還不止此。單就這個簡單的統計數字看來，也可知道當前德國石油問題的嚴重了。</p>
<p>為了增加石油燃料的生產，除上述那些人工製造石油、燃料的辦法外，德國政府過去曾以二億五千萬馬克結合了十大褐炭公司，來努力生產石油精。最近更决定在一九三六年和一九三七年投入巨額的資金。據他們的估計，在許多有利的條件下，德國在一九三七年當可生產百萬噸的合成石油精。但是，這與上述德國在戰時所需燃料的數量比較起來，仍是很小的數字。這種情形便明白地告訴了我們：德國石油自給自足的努力已經宣告失敗了。</p>
<p>由於戰爭的準備，由於石油的缺乏，由於石油自給自足的努力之失敗，德國更不得不注意選擇未來戰爭中的同盟者。在這選擇中，當然要找一個石油產額豐富的國家，這在德國軍部但出現了親英派和親美派。同時，小協約國中的羅馬尼亞也有豐富的石油產額，因而該國也頗為希特勒所注意。最近羅馬尼亞內閣改組，頗有親德的傾向，論者比　這是國社黨的作用；若然，那就更表現了：德國的石油問題不僅是它國內的一個重大問題，而且與德國的外交，因而與國際政治經濟，都是有深切關係的。</p>

<h3>萬有引力律之修正</h3>
<p>— 啟蒙</p>
<p>現在學校裏所講的物理學教科書上，關於力學部分，其基本原理仍然是根據牛頓（Newton）的三個運動定律，還是千篇一律地溫習着牛頓的，「萬有引力法則」，一點也沒有摻進新的成分。除了在某些專門的自然科學雜誌上聞或介紹過一點新的力學原理的常識外，大學堂理科的講堂上却仍然沿用着十九世紀的西文原版，講義，這不能不為我們的學術界和教育界惋惜！</p>
<p>在沒有說到牛頓的萬有引力法則之被修正以前，無妨述一述萬有引力的大概。</p>
<p>牛頓有一天在公園裏面玩要時，偶然間看見樹上的蘋菓落在地面，因而就悟到地球的吸引力，以為蘋菓之下落是由於受地心的吸引力之故。推而廣之，又以為地球和其他行星之繞著太陽旋轉而不分離，也是由於太陽之吸引力吸引着地球及各行星之故，同樣月球之繞地球，其他衛星之繞其他行星，以及地球上各種物件之附着於地球，都是原於這個理由。因而得出萬有引力論，其法則如次：</p>
<p>在宇寓間，相對的物體，不問其距離如何，都相互吸引。其力之大小與物體的質量之積成正比，與其距離之自乘成反比。</p>
<p>地球這一物體的質量之積大於地球表面的各種物體的質量之積，而距離又最近，所以蘋菓必墮於地球表面，而不墮於月球表面，也不墮於太陽或其行星表面，而月球之必依傍着地球，地球及各行星之必環繞着太陽，根據萬有引力，又加引力相拒力的相引和相拒的作用，也就得以證明了。牛頓的萬有引力律大致如上所說。這是一百年來力學界奉為基準的力學原理。</p>
<p>但是一切學術都是進步的，都在不斷地進化着，而萬有引力法則也不能例外。</p>
<p>在未說到萬有引力律被修正之前，我們不妨先述一述新力學從舊力學產生的情形。成為舊力學的基礎的。是牛頓的運動法則，這法則是要在宇宙中假定一個絕對靜止的基準體，作為運動體之測量的坐標。但是現在我們知道這種假說是不合理的，因為他用以作絕對靜止的基準體之「以太」，在近代物理學上早已證明其不必要，而且為神秘玄虛的東西了，空間絕無這種非物體而又不運動的東西。再者，舊力學認為長度，時間，質量是一定不變的。但現在早已證明這三者因為本身在運動過程中，要變生變化，而且是相對地被規定着的。舊力學之於力的觀念，是假定一絕對靜止的基準體，對基準體有加速度的物體，受力的作用。現在既無須假定這絕對靜止的基準體了，自然現象是一定要以觀察者為標準而行考察，所以不能不修改從來力學的觀念。</p>
<p>舉個例子來說：飛機上的乘客開始降落時，似乎感到自身重量在減少。如果飛機以「重力的加速度」下降，那乘客將會感到似乎完全失去自身的重量。如果飛機以外的標準體去看牠，那乘客便是以「重力速度」運動，同時可說是受重力的作用，不過如以乘客自身為標準，而他不看外面，那連他自身的運動也不知道了，而且自身的重量——即重力對自身所加的</p>

<h3>The Fengtai Incident Has Been Resolved: Authorities Dispatched to Prevent Reckless Actions; Misunderstanding Cleared After Negotiations; Both Sides Line Up to Express Apologies</h3>
<p>(Beiping) On the evening of the 18th, troops stationed in Fengtai of the 29th Army had a dispute with the Japanese garrison troops. The situation was serious at the time. Subsequently, authorities from both China and Japan dispatched personnel to Fengtai for negotiations, and a peaceful resolution was reached today. The incident began at 6 PM on the 18th when Chinese and Japanese troops stationed in Fengtai were conducting exercises outside. On their return, they encountered each other near Dajing Village. Due to the narrow road, the horse ridden by a Japanese officer entered the area occupied by our troops, leading to a dispute. Our troops immediately formed ranks and returned to their camp. The Japanese insisted on disarming our troops and took company commander Zhao to the Japanese barracks. Several hundred Japanese soldiers then surrounded our barracks. The two sides confronted each other, and the situation was extremely tense. Order in Fengtai was disrupted. Upon hearing the news, Chinese and Japanese authorities in Beiping, around 8 PM that evening, the Japanese embassy's military attache Imai immediately visited Chen Zhongfu for negotiations. Chen then visited Matsumuro and Kawabe to discuss and decide that both sides would send personnel to investigate and prevent either side from acting rashly. The 29th Army then dispatched Xu Changlin, deputy commander of the 37th Division, Qi Hongmai, staff officer of the military headquarters, and Lin Gengyu, section chief of the Foreign Affairs Committee. The Japanese side sent representatives Colonel Mutaguchi, commander of the regiment, Hamada, assistant officer, and Nakajima Sakurai, Japanese advisor to the political council. At midnight, they went to Fengtai, summoned Zhang Huating, battalion commander of the 29th Army, and the commander of the Japanese garrison troops to discuss a reconciliation plan. Song also sent representatives Zhen and Chen Juesheng, who arrived by special train this morning. The misunderstanding was then cleared up. The Japanese army ordered its troops to withdraw and released our detained company commander Zhao. At 10:20 AM, officers from both sides gathered the troops from both sides, lined them up at the station, and lined up in separate rows to salute each other to express goodwill. Then, they each withdrew their troops to their barracks. A dispute was thus resolved, and order in Fengtai was restored. The representatives from both sides also returned to Beiping and Tianjin to report. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the misunderstanding between Chinese and Japanese troops in Fengtai, it is reported that both sides have peacefully resolved it on the spot on the morning of the 19th. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 6 PM on the afternoon of the 18th, the Fengtai incident was resolved through mutual understanding between China and Japan. Mutaguchi, commander of the 1st Infantry Regiment of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, rushed to investigate that night with staff officer Watanabe and adjutant Ono. The Tianjin garrison requested a special train from the Beining Railway at 4 AM on the 19th and sent senior staff officer Iida along with assistants Asai and Kai, accompanied by Zhen Jiyin, advisor to the Tianjin Municipal Government, and Liu Shaokun, counselor, to investigate. They finished at 12 PM, returned to Tianjin by the same train to report. At 10 AM on the morning of the 19th, Song sent Chen Juesheng and Zhang Zizhong to the Haiguang Temple headquarters to visit Chief of Staff Hashimoto, offering verbal apologies. The Japanese side's attitude was stable, and the incident would not be escalated. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin Municipal Government announced that on the afternoon of the 18th, the Zhang Battalion of the 37th Division of the 29th Army stationed in Fengtai was conducting exercises outside. Coincidentally, the Japanese garrison stationed there was also conducting exercises. Around 7 PM, when the two armies were returning to their teams after the exercises, a misunderstanding arose due to yielding the road. The two sides confronted each other, and the situation seemed very serious. Chairman Song, Mayor Qin, and Mayor Zhang in Tianjin received the report. The headquarters of the Japanese garrison also received the news. After discussions between both sides, our side dispatched Zhen Mingzhang, advisor to the Tianjin Municipal Government, from Tianjin, and the 37th Division's Deputy Commander from Peiping. The Japanese side dispatched advisors Sakurai and Nakajima from Tianjin, together with Kawabe and Matsumuro, and a certain regimental commander dispatched by the two military officers, rushed to assist in the mediation. After several hours of negotiations, the matter was completely resolved by 9 AM on the 19th, and mutual salutes were exchanged. Fortunately, a misunderstanding was peacefully resolved, and the local area did not experience any panic. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tianjin Japanese army staff officer Wachi visited Zhu at No. 133, No. 17 of the British concession at 11 AM on the 19th regarding the Fengtai incident, for about an hour. Unresolved matters regarding Fengtai will be negotiated by Matsumuro, Chen Zhongfu, and Mutaguchi, commander of the 1st Infantry Regiment of the Japanese army in Beiping. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This reporter went to Fengtai on the morning of the 19th to investigate the truth of the Sino-Japanese military conflict. A brief record is as follows: The Sino-Japanese military confrontation began at 6 PM on the afternoon of the 18th and lasted until 10 AM on the morning of the 19th before withdrawing. The report in the telegram on the 18th that the withdrawal had already occurred at 12 PM that night was a misrepresentation. The Japanese military sent more than 600 people to Fengtai in succession, all fully armed, carrying machine guns and small artillery pieces. Our side also increased a considerable number of troops. The cause of the conflict was that the armies of both sides were marching in formation on the afternoon of the 18th and met on Zhengyang Street in Fengtai. Because neither side was willing to give way, three Japanese cavalry officers suddenly charged into our military ranks, injuring several of our soldiers who were trampled by the horses. Company commander Sun Xiangting was also abducted by the Japanese army, and the situation became serious. The two sides successively increased their forces, creating a confrontational state. In Dajing Village near Fengtai, the Japanese army opened fire as soon as the armies of both sides met. Our side also returned fire. As a result, two of our soldiers and one civilian were injured, and then they each retreated. The Fengtai military camp of our side was surrounded by the Japanese army. Both sides climbed onto the rooftops, separated only by a ridge, and confronted each other for more than ten hours. The Japanese army also piled sandbags on the roofs of various civilian houses and set up machine guns. Merchants closed their doors and were in extreme panic. All telephones were also cut off by the Japanese army. Many innocent civilians were arrested, beaten, and humiliated by the Japanese army. Therefore, Fengtai became a world of terror for a time. Fortunately, our army was ordered to only defend and not to open fire easily. Therefore, although the Japanese army surrounded our military camp, it did not turn into a tragedy. Fortunately, Song Zheyuan sent Xu Changlin, deputy commander of the 37th Division, and Zhou Sijing, staff officer of the 29th Army, along with Japanese personnel sent by Tashiro, such as Inoi, to Fengtai. After several hours of negotiations, the armies of both sides withdrew at 10 AM on the morning of the 19th. Then, they each lined up in the large parade ground to show each other the military salute and express their apologies. Our company commander Sun Xiangting was then released by the Japanese side, and the matter was thus resolved. Xu and others also returned to Beiping and will visit Song in Tianjin to report everything. Regarding the aftermath, it is heard that China and Japan will discuss appropriate measures to prevent future misunderstandings between the two armies, in order to achieve the goal of friendship. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chen Zhongfu, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said that a dispute occurred between the Chinese and Japanese garrisons in Fengtai last night. After mediation by personnel from both sides, the misunderstanding has been cleared and good relations have been restored. The Japanese side has no demands. The transfer of Chinese garrison troops is our own initiative. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fengtai: Yesterday's Fengtai incident was resolved at 9:30 AM today. At the same time, the Japanese military lifted the siege. The Chinese military gathered in the same way in the open space in front of the station. Both sides shook hands, and the matter was resolved. (19th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the Ministry of the Army received the report of the Fengtai incident, Army Minister Terauchi and his senior adjutant, Secretary Yamamoto, and Lieutenant Colonel Mikuni of the press section, rushed to the ministry at 1:00 AM. Based on the on-site report, they considered countermeasures. However, because the true facts were unclear, they decided to wait for a detailed report before deciding on the attitude of the central army headquarters. (19th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Ikeda, staff officer of the Tianjin garrison, left Tianjin for Fengtai at 6 AM this morning. Also, Lieutenant Colonel Wachi plans to meet with Song Zheyuan today. (19th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Last night, Chinese and Japanese soldiers in Fengtai exchanged fire, firing many bullets, but there were no deaths or injuries. This matter has now been verified. This morning, the area has returned to normal. Chinese and Japanese authorities are currently conducting negotiations in Beiping regarding this case. Both sides clearly wish to achieve a peaceful resolution. The Japanese military in Fengtai has released one Chinese army sergeant who was detained during the conflict. Both sides are now guarding their respective positions. After this case occurred, Chen Zhongfu, chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee's Foreign Affairs Committee, immediately visited Matsumuro, director of the Japanese Special Service Agency in North China, and Kawabe, commander of the Japanese army in Beiping, along with a Japanese advisor. Chen then telegraphed Chen Song Zheyuan, while Matsumuro and others telegraphed Tashiro, commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in North China. Tashiro was in Tianjin at the time. Song Zheyuan immediately consulted with Tashiro and then ordered the two armies in Fengtai not to take any action that would escalate the situation. During the conflict between the two sides, mortars were fired, but fortunately, in the dark, they could not be aimed accurately, so no damage was inflicted on the other side. This case occurred when a Japanese army unit was passing in front of the barracks of the 37th Division of the 29th Army. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Public Security Bureau Convenes Security Meeting; Armed Japanese Soldiers Parade in Demonstration</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At 4 PM on the 19th, Cheng Xixian, Director of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, convened a security meeting. Cheng explained the measures to be taken to maintain local security in the face of the unstable situation. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM. On the 19th, due to numerous rumors in the city, the security team was fully armed and patrolled the streets in cooperation with armored vehicles. Double posts were stationed at all major intersections. The guards were only slightly relaxed when news of the resolution of the Fengtai incident reached Tianjin in the evening. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 9 AM on the 19th, more than 1,000 Japanese infantry soldiers from the East Bureau Suburb of Tianjin, fully armed, paraded from the Hebei New Railway Station via Xin Da Lu, Dong Ma Lu, and Jingang Bridge, and entered the Japanese concession. In the afternoon, they returned to the Dong Bureau Suburb barracks by the same route. Eight armored vehicles and fifteen trucks, carrying hundreds of soldiers, also paraded along Dong Ma Lu in front of the East Floating Bridge Public Security Bureau at 4 PM. They returned to the Haiguang Temple barracks around 2 PM. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Shi Jingting Meets Han Fuqu and Goes to Tianjin from Jinan to Visit Song Zheyuan</h3>

<p>(Tianjin) Tashiro hosted a banquet for Song at the commander's residence in Zhang Garden at 6 PM on the 19th, inviting Qin Dechun, Zhang Zizhong, Qi Xieyuan, Lu Zongyu, Cao Rulin, and others to attend, accompanied by Hashimoto Iida and other staff members of the military headquarters. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Smuggled Goods Sell Well in Tianjin Suburbs; Customs Checkpoints Are Weak and Exist in Name Only; Li Qingxuan Visits Qin Dechun Again</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) With the old-style Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, smuggled goods are selling well in the rural towns. Smugglers use large trucks to transport smuggled goods directly to various places in southern Hebei and Baoding. The three customs checkpoints on the outskirts of Tianjin exist in name only. Not a single case has been intercepted in the past week. Because the strength of each checkpoint is weak, the Tianjin Customs has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance again, requesting local military and police authorities to dispatch more police officers to assist. Li Qingxuan visited Qin Dechun and Wang Hongen again on the 19th to discuss the inspection of smuggled goods in Hebei and Chahar. The Hebei-Chahar General Inspection Office seized a batch of undeclared smuggled rayon and sugar in the western suburbs of Tianjin on the 19th and has sent a letter to the Japanese consulate to discuss penalties. On the 16th, the Tianjin Unified Tax Management Office seized 30 boxes of smuggled spirits at the western suburbs Hanqiao. On the 19th, a profiteer Zhao Haiting, accompanied by a rōnin Take Taka, went to the tax office, claiming to be the owner of the goods, and forcibly loaded the detained spirits onto a truck and left. The police stopped them but they did not listen. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The opinions on the inspection of smuggled goods put forward by Wang Hongen, director of the Hebei-Chahar Inspection Office, have become a thing of the past. All activities of the office have been temporarily suspended. The Ministry of Finance has drafted compromise measures and will issue them to Tianjin in the coming days based on Li Qingxuan's report. Song largely agrees with this, but the implementation methods still need to be discussed. In the future, smuggled goods piled up in Tianjin will be registered within a certain period and allowed to be sold after paying fees. Incoming smuggled goods will still be intercepted by customs, local military, and police authorities. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Smuggled goods piled up like mountains in Dalian, and there is also a lot piled up in Tianjin. Smugglers have reached the final critical juncture of life and death and eagerly hope that Hebei and Chahar will implement the new tax. They earnestly urge their diplomats to urge the Hebei-Chahar authorities to issue a consumption tax system. The Japanese industrial community needs raw materials from North China and even hopes that the scope of the new tax system will be expanded to include export goods. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The transport of smuggled goods to the south was reported to have decreased sharply, but recently they have been discovered again, and the Hebei-Chahar Inspection Office is suspected of being lenient. Jinling Customs recently seized a batch of miscellaneous smuggled porcelain and other items and submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to publicly auction them on the 21st. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Qingxuan, Counselor of the Ministry of Finance, reported the progress of his meeting with the Hebei-Chahar authorities in Peiping to the ministry by telegram. The Ministry of Finance entrusted Li Qingxuan with the principles of a complete tariff system and protection of the interests of legitimate merchants. The results of Li's negotiations in Peiping show that there are no problems in principle. However, the procedures for paying customs duties on stockpiled smuggled goods still need to be slightly modified. They can be completely resolved next week. It is also reported that the anti-smuggling work of the various sub-checkpoints of the Tianjin Customs will also increase its effectiveness due to the discussions between Counselor Li and the Peiping-Tianjin authorities.

Japanese marines were also subsequently deployed for alert. Japanese policeman Yoshioka died from injuries to vital organs. His remains were sent by the Japanese side to the Dōjinkai Hospital at approximately 3:00 PM. Simultaneously, Japanese marines boarded their ships at 3:30 PM that afternoon, and traffic order returned to normal. However, the search of pedestrians has not ceased. It is verified that Yoshioka was a native of Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan, 29 years old, and had been serving in Hankou since 1933. Furthermore, after receiving notification from the Japanese side, the Hankou Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched Chief Inspector Shi Yufen, Section Chief Dong Keren, and Chief of the 13th Branch of the Public Security Bureau, Wan Dima, to the Japanese concession to meet with Police Chief Shimoda of the Japanese police station, representing Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Xizeng to express condolences. It was stated that although this matter occurred within the Japanese concession, our government is extremely concerned about it and will certainly provide assistance in investigating the perpetrator. Police Chief Shimoda of the Japanese police station replied to Chief Inspector Wang and others, expressing gratitude for the condolences from our government and stating that the Japanese side is currently conducting an investigation and will notify our side for assistance once they have some leads. In addition, Hankou Mayor Wu Guozhen, upon hearing the news, also telephoned Japanese Consul-General Miura to express condolences. (Central News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Yoshioka Teijiro of River Street in the Japanese Concession of this city was shot and killed at 10:55 AM on the 19th.

(Central News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Yoshioka, a police officer of the Japanese consulate in Hankou, was shot in the head with a pistol and killed on the spot at 11:50 AM this morning while on guard duty at the intersection of River Street and Taisho Street in the Japanese Concession. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Consul-General Miura requested the Chinese authorities to arrest the perpetrator as soon as possible regarding the assassination of the Japanese policeman. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the shooting and killing of a Japanese patrolman in the Japanese concession in Hankou, Hankou Mayor Wu Guozhen telegraphed a report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that at 11:00 AM today, the Hankou Municipal Government received a telephone report from the Japanese consulate stating that a Japanese patrolman was shot and killed at the Meiji Wharf in the Japanese concession, and the perpetrator is at large. He immediately telegraphed Consul-General Miura to express condolences and stated that if there was anything the municipal government could assist with, it would do its best. He also instructed the Public Security Bureau to send personnel to the Japanese concession police station to liaise. (Central News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) A Central News Agency reporter visited Japanese Vice-Consul Shirai Oka in the afternoon of the 19th. According to Shirai, the deceased was named Yoshioka Teijiro, 29 years old, from Nagasaki Prefecture, and had been working in Hankou since 1933. The incident occurred at the post next to the Nisshin Wharf entrance on Taisho Street in the Japanese concession. The bullet entered the bone marrow from the left side of the neck, killing him instantly. The time was 11:30 AM. A neighboring patrolman heard the gunshot and immediately reported it to the Japanese police station. At 11:35 AM, personnel from the Japanese police station and the consulate arrived at the scene and saw the body lying next to the post. A No. 2 cartridge casing (as called by the Japanese) was found near the body, and another cartridge casing was found near a cigarette stand ten yards away from the body. The cigarette vendor witnessed the incident and said that the perpetrator was a man in his thirties wearing a long coat, who came from the Meiji Trading Company on River Street and fled back the same way after firing the shot. At that time, a coal truck happened to be passing by. It was initially reported that the perpetrator jumped off the truck, committed the crime, and then left on the truck, but this is not accurate. The Japanese police have now detained the vendor and Chinese people who were nearby at the time for questioning. Regarding the location of the incident, Shirai said it was not under the jurisdiction of the Japanese concession, as the Meiji Trading Company's headquarters are located there, and the riverbank flood defenses there are constructed by us, which is evidence of this. The reporter asked if China had set up posts there, to which he replied no. Shirai also said that the Japanese side now believes that the deceased was buying cigarettes next to the cigarette stand when he was shot, hence the cartridge casing found near the cigarette stand. The reporter asked why the body was next to the post, and Shirai replied that it was likely that Chinese people nearby moved the body to the post after the incident. The reporter asked if there was blood near the cigarette stand, and Shirai replied no, probably because it had been washed away. It is investigated that the incident occurred at 11:30 AM this morning, and the Japanese police arrived at 11:35 AM, moved the body, and destroyed the evidence, which seems unlikely to have been completed within five minutes. The claims of Vice-Consul Shirai are therefore subject to further investigation. Regarding the issue of jurisdiction, according to the map of the Japanese concession, it is indeed within the Japanese concession. The Japanese concession is now conducting enhanced post checks of pedestrians, and the situation is quite tense. (Central News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Yoshioka, a police officer of the consulate here, was shot and killed by an unknown assailant this morning while patrolling the border of the Japanese concession. The Japanese concession and the adjacent Special District One have both declared martial law. The perpetrator descended from a freight truck, fired two shots at Yoshioka, one of which hit him in the head, causing him to fall to the ground and die instantly. Having achieved his purpose, the perpetrator then sped away in the truck. The truck was parked on the side of the road at the time, and the engine was running. Although a search is underway, the perpetrator has not been apprehended. The only clue is a cartridge casing found several yards from where the deceased fell. Chinese and Japanese authorities are now cooperating to thoroughly investigate the case. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3>The Issue of Opening Huangpu Port and Connecting the Yuehan and Guangzhou-Kowloon Railways</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Yuehan Railway, the authorities have been actively preparing to build the Huangpu branch line and open Huangpu Commercial Port, allowing the Yuehan Railway to reach the sea and facilitate the import and export of passengers and goods. Guangzhou can then become a major world commercial port. Originally, before the Opium War, Guangzhou was not only the commercial center of southern China and an important Chinese commercial port but also a major metropolis on the Pacific coast and the commercial center of Asia. Its position in the overall Chinese economy was very important. After the Opium War, its position was gradually taken over by Hong Kong. Seeing this, Sun Yat-sen wanted to complete the Yuehan Railway and improve the Guangzhou-Huangpu waterway to restore Guangzhou's inherent economic position. Unfortunately, this plan could not be realized during his lifetime. Now that the country is unified, the authorities are starting to implement it, which is naturally a welcome thing.</p>
<p>According to railway regulations, the starting or ending point of all main lines must be connected to the sea or deep waterways to fully facilitate the import and export of passengers and goods, facilitate transportation, and reap the benefits of both water and land transportation. The Yuehan Railway starts in the south from Huangsha River in Guangzhou, passes through Hunan and Hubei in the north, and reaches Hankou, connecting with the Pinghan Railway to form a major artery connecting north and south China. However, the places connected by its starting and ending points are shallow inland rivers, which cannot fully realize its role in transportation economics. Therefore, the Ministry of Railways plans to move the starting point of the Yuehan Railway to Huangpu to comply with the regulations for major railway lines. However, although Huangpu is on the coast, the seawater is very shallow, and ships of 20,000 or 30,000 tons or more cannot enter or exit. Therefore, in addition to actively building the Huangpu branch line, the authorities must also actively improve the Huangpu waterway so that the largest modern navigation ships can enter and exit at any time without hindrance. After this plan is realized, it will definitely make the market in Guangzhou prosperous.</p>
<p>However, during the period of opening Huangpu Port, we also heard rumors of the Yuehan Railway and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway being connected. If this is indeed the case, then the above-mentioned plan will not be realized, and Guangzhou will have no way of becoming a world commercial port. On the other hand, Hong Kong and Kowloon can become the only import and export points in southern China, and Britain will be able to expand its business in South China. Because Hong Kong and Kowloon have wide and deep ports, before the Huangpu Port is completed, connecting the Yuehan Railway and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway would allow Hong Kong and Kowloon to take advantage of their wide and deep ports to become the import and export ports of the Yuehan Railway. This is enough to hinder the prosperity of Guangzhou.</p>
<p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of this issue? Sun Yat-sen also explained it very clearly in his "The International Development of China": "If Guangzhou becomes a world port, then all the uses of Hong Kong as a shipping station for carrying goods will naturally disappear. But judging from this developed Guangzhou and prosperous China, there must be other ways to benefit Hong Kong, which must be a hundred times more beneficial than it is now as the exclusive seaport of a declining and impoverished China... As such, the Hong Kong authorities should use all their strength to encourage this improvement of Guangzhou as a seaport and should no longer use all their strength to prevent it as they have done in the past." Based on the above, we deeply hope that the rumor of connecting the Yuehan Railway and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway will not be realized and that the Hong Kong authorities can also provide sympathetic assistance to the construction of Guangzhou Harbor.</p>

<h3>Director-General Chiang Urges Investigation of Opium and Drug Abuse</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Director-General Chiang has issued an order to all agencies since April regarding the investigation of opium and drug abuse among Party, government, and military service personnel. As of the end of August, the number of completed forms received by the committee differs greatly from the number of civil and military agencies nationwide. According to the original measures, each agency should have completed this within two months of receiving the order. Although it has been a long time since the deadline, and some have been granted extensions due to special circumstances, there are still many who have delayed until now and have not yet held investigations. In order to enforce the investigation, Director-General Chiang recently submitted a request to the National Government to order the central agencies and the central direct agencies stationed in various provinces and cities to expedite their handling. He also ordered the responsible agencies or troops to immediately investigate those agencies and troops that have not yet completed the forms and urge them to expedite their handling in accordance with the previous order.

<h3>National Government Issues Earnest Order Strictly Prohibiting Illegal Electioneering</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government recently instructed the Executive Yuan, the Military Affairs Commission, and the General Election Office for National Assembly Representatives, stating that in order to comply with the instructions, it has been found that the election of National Assembly representatives is of great importance to the promotion of constitutional government and the development of civil rights. The central government handles this matter by fully following public opinion and acting with the utmost impartiality. Local officials and people should abide by the laws and regulations and act with caution in order to select virtuous and capable individuals to jointly govern. The government has previously issued earnest orders that there should be no behavior that violates the law in the election process. However, reports indicate that there are still instances of relying on power to oppress and manipulate. Such illegal competition will not only prevent those who are respected for their reputation and virtue from being elected but will also leave a bad impression on the voters, which is contrary to the state's purpose of guiding the people to respect constitutional government. The relevant general election supervisors, election supervisors, and election officials should be ordered to strictly correct this and not show any leniency. They should also earnestly admonish the people participating in the election to uphold this intention, exercise their right to vote in accordance with the law, maintain discipline, and emphasize important political matters. In addition to distributing it separately, it is ordered that the Yuan will transfer it for compliance. This order. (Central News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3>Harvard University's Tercentenary Celebration Bestows Honorary Degrees on Sixty-Six Individuals</h3>
<p>Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA - Harvard University, the oldest and most renowned university in North America, held its tercentenary celebration ceremony the other day, which concluded today. At the end, President Roosevelt attended and delivered a speech in three capacities. Roosevelt was originally a graduate of Harvard University, served as the chairman of the Harvard University Tercentenary Celebration Committee, and is also the current President of the United States. In his speech, President Roosevelt stated, "In these times of turmoil and uncertainty, so-called 'freedom of thought' has been banished from most countries and has no place to stand. Only Harvard University and our United States can hold the torch of truth and never extinguish it. In short, truth is the greatest thing in the world, and only truth will ultimately prevail. I do not want you to merely view tolerance and peace as neutral and impartial virtues but rather as active and positive principles, so that it may be." This time, Harvard University, in celebration of its three-hundredth anniversary, has conferred honorary doctoral degrees on many of the world's most famous scholars, including those of England, Scotland, France, Italy, Switzerland, Japan, Argentina, Norway, Germany, and the Soviet Union. Also among them are nine world-renowned scholars from various countries who have won the Nobel Prize. Furthermore, before President Roosevelt visited the school today to deliver a speech, twenty-four Harvard University graduates presented a petition to the President requesting that he re-examine the Lowell Committee's report on the Sacco and Vanzetti case. Sacco and Vanzetti were both Italian-Americans who, due to their usual belief in anarchism, were resented by the authorities. Later, they were implicated in a terrorist act and imprisoned. The court sentenced them to death. At the time, American liberals repeatedly sought a retrial due to insufficient evidence. After several years, the original verdict was upheld. In August 1927, the death sentence was carried out. When the two convicts were not yet executed, the Americans organized a committee, chaired by Harvard University President Lowell. The committee's final report did not allow intervention to prevent the execution of the death sentence. Sacco and Vanzetti could not escape death. This is an old case from several years ago.

<h3>European Troubles Multiply; League of Nations Seeks Respite; Proposal to Postpone Discussion of Covenant Amendment; Abyssinia to Be Denied Attendance</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Amidst the repeated occurrence of the Danzig diplomatic turmoil and the escalation of the Spanish Civil War, the League of Nations Administrative Council held its 93rd session today to discuss the issue of maintaining world peace. However, it is unlikely to make any resolutions regarding Italy's annexation of Abyssinia and Germany's reoccupation of the Rhineland. It is generally believed that the Council intends to gain a respite at this session, hoping to gradually recover after the League of Nations' failure to resolve European issues. No Italian representatives attended today's meeting. However, after the General Assembly rejects the attendance of Abyssinian representatives next Monday, the Italian chief representative, Sir Aloisi, will lead his country's delegation to attend. He believes that the discussion of League of Nations reform will inevitably be postponed. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The 93rd session of the League of Nations Administrative Council opened tonight, chaired by Chilean representative Mr. Figuna. The meeting was of a closed nature and began with the determination of the agenda. Based on the requests of the Iranian and Iraqi governments, it was decided not to include the border dispute between the two countries on the agenda. It was also decided to submit the document from the governments of 18 nations regarding the principles of implementing the League of Nations Covenant to the General Assembly. League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol delivered a statement describing his recent visit to Italy and reported to the Administrative Council on his meetings with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano in Rome. It is said that Mussolini proposed conditions that Italy would only participate in this General Assembly if no Abyssinian representatives were present. He also stated that he had informed Mussolini that this issue must be decided by the General Assembly's Credentials Committee. It is rumored that the committee will point out that the Abyssinian government has largely failed to fulfill the conditions stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant. It is expected that a majority of countries in the General Assembly will approve this recommendation, allowing Italy to return to the League of Nations. Spanish representative de los Caballero, who currently serves as Foreign Minister in the Cabellero cabinet, lodged a serious protest today with French Foreign Minister Delbos regarding Portugal's continued violation of neutrality obligations in the Spanish Civil War. Mr. Delbos also acknowledged the inappropriateness and intolerability of Portugal's attitude. (Reuters Telegram, 18th)</p>

<h3>British Government Sends Invitations to Convene Five-Power Conference; Total Solution to European Problems to Be Sought</h3>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Eden today sent diplomatic notes to the representatives in London of the Locarno Treaty countries (France, Italy, and Germany), containing suggestions for preliminary discussions in order to convene a conference to discuss European issues. It is reported that the diplomatic note was not made public. It is widely believed that it must express Britain's desire to achieve a total solution to European problems, without specifically mentioning the Soviet Union. (Reuters Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the future Locarno Conference, the British government advocates convening it as soon as possible. The German newspaper here, Die Weile, recently commented on this and expressed surprise, saying, "If there is a maneuver attempting to divert the attention and energy of European countries, concentrating them on one issue so that they can act freely in other international areas, Italy must be very vigilant and strengthen its imperial position to counter it. From now on, all diplomatic activities and political evolution must be based on the premise of an imperial position." (Havas Telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3>French Premier Invites British Foreign Secretary to Meet; Discussion of Five-Power Conference Issues</h3>
<p>(London) According to official sources, British Foreign Secretary Eden, at the suggestion of French Premier Léon Blum, will pass through Paris when traveling to Geneva to attend the League of Nations General Assembly, to hold talks with key figures in the French government. The purpose of the talks is regarding preparations for the Locarno Five-Power Conference. The British government has already notified the governments of France, Belgium, Italy, and Germany, which are parties to the Locarno Treaty, that the note proposes that the Five-Power Conference should first resolve various issues related to Western Europe, and then also address other issues in Europe. The initiation of the Five-Power Conference was due to Germany's re-militarization of the Rhineland area on March 7 of this year. Subsequently, France, Britain, and Belgium held a meeting in London and decided to convene a Five-Power Conference to seek a solution. Therefore, the resolution of the Western European issue should take precedence over other issues. (Havas Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>Germany Plans to Establish Anti-Soviet Front with Japan; Ambassador to Japan Suddenly Scheduled to Return to His Post; Will Recognition of Manchukuo Be a Condition?</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Diplomatic circles here are speculating on the possibility of Germany and Japan establishing an "anti-Bolshevik" front, as German Ambassador to Japan Dr. Dirksen is scheduled to depart for his post on October 13. It is now believed that Dirksen was originally supposed to be transferred to the post of Ambassador to the UK, but his work in Tokyo has been so outstanding that it is difficult to let him leave his original position for long. During his participation in the Nuremberg Nazi Party Congress, Dirksen met with the German Ambassadors to Russia, Schlenburg, the UK, Ribbentrop, and the Ambassadors to France and Italy. He personally listened to Führer Hitler's fierce criticism of Bolshevism. Based on the speculation of people here, Dirksen's decision to return to his original post in Tokyo was made after receiving instructions to increase the common interests of Japan and Germany on the Soviet issue. It is now believed that although there will be no formal alliance or military agreement between Germany and Japan, it is hoped that Germany and Japan can lead the world in establishing an entire anti-communist front, which would be supported by France, Britain, and Italy. If Japan sympathizes with Germany's views on the Soviet issue, then Germany may deem it appropriate to officially recognize "Manchukuo." Ribbentrop attended a discussion with Japanese experts last Saturday, and it is said that he strongly supported the plan. (Reuters Telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3>German Foreign Minister Arrives in Hungarian Capital; Austria and Hungary Hope Germany Will Join the Rome Bloc</h3>
<p>Hungarian Capital: German Foreign Minister Neurath and his wife arrived here by plane at 12:40 PM today. Although the trip is said to be of a private nature, Count Sznaki, Counselor of the Hungarian Prime Minister's Office and Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, welcomed them at the airport. It is rumored that Neurath's trip is to meet with Hungarian Foreign Minister Kanya and Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt. (Havas Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital: Well-informed sources recently stated that Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt has returned to Vienna after visiting Italy and meeting with Italian authorities. He is scheduled to travel from Vienna to here today or tomorrow, and then go to Regent Horthy's villa in Gödöllő, where he will go hunting and take the opportunity to meet with Hungarian Foreign Minister Kanya and German Foreign Minister Neurath. It is generally believed that Hungary and Austria both want Germany to join the Italo-Austro-Hungarian Rome Protocols, and this gathering of the foreign ministers of Germany, Austria, and Hungary is related to this matter.

<h3>German Anti-Soviet Movement Only Verbal; Aimed at Internal Consumption</h3>
<p>(Berlin) During the Nazi Party's annual congress in Nuremberg a few days ago, Führer Hitler and key Nazi figures repeatedly delivered speeches attacking the Soviet Union, criticizing the Soviet system and the leaders of the Moscow government without reservation. However, to date, these anti-Soviet speeches have not been manifested in practical measures. On the recent "Army Day" in Germany, the Soviet military attaché to the German embassy, Orlov, was still invited by Minister of Defense General von Blomberg to participate in the review. Orlov was also invited to observe the German Army's autumn maneuvers scheduled for this Sunday. In addition, German industry continues to exchange German-made machinery for Russian raw materials, and German banks provide long-term loans to support the development of trade between Germany and Russia. The Soviet trade delegation in Germany continues to operate regularly in Germany, and German industrial organizations even have specialized departments to handle trade with Russia. It is also noteworthy that the German embassy in the UK has formally stated that Germany has no intention of attacking the Soviet Union, and when rumors circulated that the German ambassador to the Soviet Union, Schlenburg, was leaving his post and returning home, the German government immediately denied it. From this, it can be seen that the anti-Soviet speeches made at the Nuremberg Congress are mainly for internal consumption, not external. Moreover, since Bismarck, the tradition of German diplomacy has been to form an alliance with Russia. German diplomats, industrialists, and military personnel still adhere to this tradition, believing that a German-Russian alliance may still become a reality in the future. Furthermore, the German-Russian Friendship Treaty signed in Berlin on April 24, 1926, by the late German Foreign Minister Stresemann and representatives of the Soviet government, has been renewed every year since the Nazi Party came to power, without interruption to this day. This is also worth noting. (Havas Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>Bridge Across Danube River Connects Yugoslavia and Romania; Authorities of Both Countries Have Agreed to Implement It</h3>
<p>Yugoslav Capital: Regarding the issue of Yugoslavia and Romania building a bridge across the Danube River, Premier and Foreign Minister Stojadinović discussed it with Romanian Premier Tătărescu during his visit to Romania a few days ago. Romanian Minister of Transport Vlădescu was ordered to come to discuss this matter. He met with Premier and Foreign Minister Stojadinović and Minister of Transport Spaho. After the discussions, it was decided to build a bridge across the Danube River at Kladovo in Yugoslavia and Turnu Severin in Romania to facilitate transportation. The route within Yugoslavia that needs to connect with the Romanian railway has also been surveyed. Other important measures related to the bridge's engineering, technical aspects, and financing have also been jointly agreed upon. (Havas Telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3>Poland Recruits 100,000 Volunteers; Response to Germany's Extension of Military Service</h3>
<p>Warsaw: The government announced the establishment of a voluntary work system at the beginning of this week. This measure is actually a response to Germany's extension of military service. Germany announced last month that it would increase the length of military service from one year to two years, thereby doubling the number of regular troops. However, the original length of military service in Poland was two years, so it was not convenient to increase it to three years. Therefore, the voluntary work system was created to make up for the deficiency. Most of those who participate in this voluntary work team will be the unemployed. It is expected that 100,000 voluntary work team members can be recruited soon. Therefore, from a social point of view, this move can reduce the number of unemployed, which is also of equal importance. Moreover, it is obvious that Poland took this step out of necessity for national defense after Germany increased its military strength. (Havas Telegram, 18th)</p>

<h3>Two Armies Continue Hand-to-Hand Combat in Ruined Spanish Fortress; Rebels Fight Like Trapped Beasts After Mine Explosion; Government Troops Follow Up with Rain of Artillery Fire</h3>
<p>Toledo: Part of the Alcázar Fortress was destroyed by government troops with a land mine yesterday, but it has not yet been completely occupied by government troops because a second land mine has not yet exploded. After the first land mine exploded, the streets inside the fortress were covered in rubble, as if an earthquake had struck. Huge rocks were blasted into the air and then fell on the roofs, smashing them. A car used by the rebels as an obstacle was blown into two pieces, one of which flew 200 yards away into the fire station. Yesterday, the fighting in the ruined fortress continued until dark. The remaining rebels were still using machine guns in the ruins to resist, preventing government troops from occupying the fortress. The bravery of the rebels is truly astonishing. However, government troops have moved light artillery to the front line to prepare for a final bombardment. It is believed that 100 rebels died in the land mine explosion, while government troops suffered 6 deaths and 12 injuries. Government troops are currently preparing to continue the attack at dawn. After the land mine exploded, the surviving rebels launched a fierce counterattack with hand grenades and mortars. Government troops, waiting for the second land mine to explode, retreated from the ruins because the rebels were fighting fearlessly and rushing forward, and ordered the remaining buildings to be bombarded with artillery fire, raining down shells and taking advantage of the opportunity to build strong obstacles in order to launch a new offensive.

<h3>Second Landmine Explodes: Rebel Flesh and Blood Fly, Southern Capital's Key Point is Safe</h3>
<p>Madrid – A landmine planted by government troops under the famous Moroccan-style Alcázar fortress in Toledo was detonated yesterday, completely destroying the fortress. Government troops were then able to occupy it. According to eyewitnesses, when the landmine exploded, huge rocks flew into the sky and then fell onto the roofs of buildings, destroying them. Several hundred rebels, including women and children, had taken refuge in the cellars, so they were not injured. The rebels, after sixty-one days of siege, were exhausted, getting only one meal a day, consisting of a small piece of horse meat and a little bread. The situation inside the fortress was terrible, with rotting corpses everywhere. However, the rebels remained defiant and continued to communicate with the outside world by radio. Among them were cadet officers and sons of nobles. A few days ago, they held a banquet to celebrate the victory of the rebel forces in Talavera and issued a "Siege War Bulletin" on a typewriter. When the entire Alcázar fortress was blown into the sky by the landmine, a column of rebels advanced at full speed, only fourteen miles from the fortress. To avoid the landmine, civilians throughout Toledo retreated to a mile and a half outside the city at night, sleeping in tents in the fierce wind. The besieged rebels bravely awaited death, sometimes breaking out to try to stop the landmine experts from completing their work. The fall of Alcázar allows government troops to control the road directly to Madrid and the railway line between Alicante and Valencia without a fight, so this battle is of great importance. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Toledo – Government forces detonated a landmine today to attack the rebels trapped in the Alcázar Palace. The battle was quite fierce. Our correspondent has recorded the details as follows: After the large landmine planted by the government forces exploded, the shock troops of the People's Militia under the General Confederation of Labor bravely charged into the rubble in front of the Alcázar Palace and raised the Republican flag. At that time, because one more landmine had not yet exploded, the shock troops stopped advancing. The rebels took the opportunity to bombard them with hand grenades and mortars, slightly injuring Colonel Barceló, the leader of the government forces. The shock troops were ordered to retreat and instead used cannons to bombard the rubble field, with shells raining down. At the same time, the rebels were setting up machine guns and cannons, planning to counterattack the government forces. Then the second landmine exploded, and for a moment, flesh and blood flew everywhere, a horrific sight. At noon, the fighting subsided slightly. At 5 p.m., the government forces launched another fierce attack. By nightfall, the government forces had made significant progress. Many rebels infiltrated into civilian houses next to the palace through underground passages, but they were all killed by the People's Militia with hand grenades. It is not expected that there will be any more fierce battles tonight. In total, the government forces have suffered six deaths and twelve injuries. The rebels have lost about a hundred people. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Toledo – After the famous Alcázar fortress in Toledo was destroyed by the government forces with explosives, most of the 1,200 rebels, women, and children inside were killed. The two bombs, each weighing 300 pounds, not only destroyed the fortress but also collapsed many houses in the city. After the explosion, shock troops and security forces of the government forces charged into the smoke and ashes with rifles and hand grenades to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the rebels. Sixty rebels were killed, and forty government troops were also killed. According to an investigation by the Associated Press, the fuse for the explosives was 200 feet long. Before the explosion, sirens and loudspeakers warned the people to evacuate quickly and demanded that the rebels release the women, children, and elderly. The explosives were buried directly under the cellar, so it is logical to assume that the women and children were the first to be affected. After the explosion, the west wall of the city collapsed first. At that time, smoke and ashes covered the sky, like a volcanic eruption. The government forces then began an eighteen-hour bombardment. The rebels continued to resist stubbornly, refusing to retreat. Finally, the government forces suspended their artillery fire and concentrated their forces on a new position, preparing for a final blow. Soon after, they began a fierce bombardment again, hoping to defeat all the remaining rebels. The government forces declared that they would need to bomb once more to completely destroy the fortress and that this would be carried out within days. (National News Agency, 18th)</p>

<p>Gibraltar – The situation in Malaga, an important port 65 miles northeast of Gibraltar, has become serious again. Internal strife has broken out among the government troops stationed there. Various groups are now engaged in fierce street fighting. The Communist Party is taking the opportunity to set fire to many magnificent buildings. The British battleship Queen Elizabeth, which was preparing to sail to Malta, arrived here yesterday and set sail for Malaga this morning with the destroyer Anthony. It is reported that the civil governor of the area, Mr. Vega, has made an urgent appeal to the Madrid government, requesting that reinforcements be sent immediately to provide emergency relief. It is rumored that this internal strife was caused by 600 members of the People's Militia refusing to continue fighting the rebels. The Communist Party in Malaga sent a letter to the Communist Party in Gibraltar, stating that they would rather turn Malaga into ashes than surrender and be shot by the rebels, as they had shot the former naval officers who had rebelled. At the same time, according to a telegram from Saint-Jean-de-Luz on the Spanish-French border, all British expatriates who wished to leave Bilbao in northern Spain have now left the country, either to Saint-Jean-de-Luz or to Bordeaux. The British consul in Bilbao and his staff boarded the HMS Exmouth yesterday and have arrived in Saint-Jean-de-Luz. There are only about seventy British expatriates remaining in Bilbao. Although the area is currently said to be quiet, there is a risk of attack by the rebels at any time. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<h3>Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group Negotiates Import of National Products in the Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>News from Batavia: The Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group, sponsored by the China National Industries Foreign Trade Association, has made a very positive impression since arriving in Java. The overseas Chinese community has given them a warm welcome. Under the leadership of Chief Gao Shiheng, the entire inspection group is cooperating with the Consulate General, the Importers Association, and the Batavia Chamber of Commerce to carry out various diplomatic activities that have attracted much attention. Traditionally, Chinese people coming to Java faced extremely difficult entry procedures. Although this Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group was not dispatched by official circles, the Dutch East Indies government has paid great attention to it. The Dutch Governor-General has specifically instructed all departments to provide hospitality, and all entry procedures have been given special treatment, making entry and exit extremely convenient, which has brought many benefits to the overseas Chinese. However, since the arrival of the inspection group, despite making various efforts to import national products, they are restricted by the Dutch East Indies controlled trade, with various goods having specific limitations. In the Dutch East Indies import and export statistics, the relationship with China is very low. According to the percentage of imports from various countries to the Dutch East Indies in 1932, China only accounted for 1.6%. Ranked by country, it was twelfth. In the same year, the trade volume from the Dutch East Indies to China accounted for 2.64% of the total exports, ranking tenth. China has always been in a trade deficit because sugar and coal, among other things, are imported in large quantities from Java. As for the Dutch East Indies' implementation of restrictive policies, it has its own standpoint, which is not to be discussed for the moment. But in any case, China is in a disadvantageous position. The inspection group's sole task is to obtain import licenses in order to receive orders. The progress is described as follows:</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies Restriction Trade Measures</p>
<p>The Dutch East Indies government, in view of the unrestricted dumping of foreign goods, which completely undermined the commercial position of its mother country, despite various international negotiations that had not succeeded, suddenly promulgated various restrictions and permitted import regulations in June 1935. The method is based on the quantity of goods imported by each importer from 1929 to 1933-35 as the basis for the permitted import quantity. In other words, the government distributes and grants the permitted import quantity based on the importer's previously reported import volume over the five years. Unfortunately, overseas Chinese compatriots paid little attention to the import business before 1933, mostly purchasing from European merchants and reselling to the local population, thus losing the opportunity for Chinese merchants to import on their own, which has caused many difficulties in doing business. Moreover, the Dutch East Indies government has entered into agreements with countries such as Britain and Germany to exchange goods, meaning that Britain purchases a certain amount of goods from the Dutch East Indies, and the Dutch East Indies must purchase an equivalent amount of goods from Britain at the same time. Therefore, the restrictive conditions for each type of goods stipulate that a certain quantity must be purchased from a specific country, while others can be freely imported from any country. China and Japan are in the category of other countries. Although there are no treaties established between Japanese goods and the Dutch East Indies, their low prices are sought after by Chinese and European merchants. Because purchasing European goods not only yields no profit but also risks losses, while purchasing Japanese goods is profitable. Chinese goods are between European and Japanese goods, making competition difficult. However, some Chinese goods can compete with Japanese goods. When an importer's own permitted quantity is used up, they may apply to the government for a special license. Since China and the Dutch East Indies have not established a commercial treaty, the only way is to remedy this situation based on this method. After the inspection group arrived in Java, European commercial firms also expressed various good intentions. However, merchants are only interested in profit, seeking low prices and profits, and there are no national boundaries. Therefore, the only hope is that domestic manufacturers can reduce costs and strive for competition, so Java still has a good market, which overseas Chinese merchants are looking forward to. If national products are the same price as Japanese goods, then they will naturally purchase national products without a doubt. This depends on the efforts of domestic manufacturers.</p>
<p>Opinions of the Dutch East Indies Department of Economic Affairs</p>
<p>Gao Shiheng, the head of the inspection group, specially accompanied our country's Consul General Song to the Department of Economic Affairs on September 5 for an informal discussion. The attendees on the other side were Shi Ganmoer, Director of the Commercial Treaty Division, Pu Ke, Director of the Commercial Division, and the Chief Secretary. Chief Gao put forward various opinions, stating that there is indeed a possibility of promoting trade between China and the Dutch East Indies, and according to statistics, Dutch goods are exported to China every year, while Chinese goods, even before a commercial treaty is established between the two sides, have extreme reasons to ask the Dutch East Indies government to allow imports to seek a balance of trade between the two sides. Although this inspection group has received generous treatment from the Dutch East Indies government, they have not been able to accept orders due to restrictions, so they requested that special licenses be issued for certain types of goods. The Dutch side replied that they would certainly strive to achieve this within the scope of possibility, but there are some items that must be imported from the mother country, or the Dutch East Indies government has already established conditions with other countries, so there are some difficulties in reality. The Dutch East Indies government does not discriminate against any country and hopes that there will be opportunities to develop trade between China and the Dutch East Indies at any time.</p>
<p>Letter from Chief Gao to the Department of Economic Affairs</p>
<p>The following is a translation of the official letter from Gao Shiheng, head of the Nanyang Inspection Group, to the Acting Minister of Economic Affairs of the Dutch East Indies: Your Excellency Acting Minister of Economic Affairs, since our inspection group entered your territory, we have received generous hospitality and various conveniences from your government. On behalf of the inspection group, I would like to express my gratitude to Your Excellency Acting Minister. Our country and the Dutch East Indies have had a long history of trade, and the relations between the two countries have always been friendly. I firmly believe that there must be opportunities to promote trade between the two sides. Our inspection group has conducted a detailed survey of the agricultural products and industrial raw materials produced in your country, and as a result, we believe that they are very suitable for our country's use. We have brought samples back to China and will find ways to use them at any time. As for our country's imports to your country, according to the statistics of imports over the years, although textiles are the most common, in fact, the supply still falls short of demand. As our inspection group visited your area, we negotiated various transactions with Chinese and European importers, but unfortunately, we were unable to do so due to the restrictions of your government's licenses. In order to solve the aforementioned difficulties, I, on behalf of the China National Industries Foreign Trade Association of our country, apply to Your Excellency Acting Minister for special import licenses for the various Chinese goods listed. I further hope to establish a permanent cooperation between the two countries and promote trade. Before a commercial treaty is formally established between the two countries, a certain amount of Chinese goods can be imported into the Dutch East Indies each year so that Chinese goods have the opportunity to prepare for import. Also, regarding the import of Chinese goods into the Dutch East Indies, there should traditionally be a certificate issued by an official Chinese institution. The China National Industries Foreign Trade Association is organized by Chinese exporters. In order to facilitate export procedures for its members, the association can issue export certificates. We would be grateful if Your Excellency Acting Minister would recognize this. I earnestly hope that this letter will be presented to Your Excellency Minister, and that you will respond promptly, and that our country's Consul General Song will forward it. I deeply hope that our two countries will establish a good trade record based on the glorious history of the past. This is the sole aspiration of our inspection group, and we want to achieve the goal with the greatest effort. We also hope that Your Excellency Acting Minister will provide assistance so that it can be realized as soon as possible. I wish you good health.</p>
<p>Various Items with Restricted Imports</p>
<p>The so-called restricted imports do not mean that the items cannot be imported at all. It means that only a certain quantity of a certain item is allowed to be imported each year, and this certain quantity must be distributed among several countries. For example, some types of cotton cloth must be imported entirely from the Netherlands, and some percentage must be imported from the United Kingdom. Dull and high-grade rayon fabrics must be imported from the Netherlands and European countries, while shiny and low-grade products can be imported from other countries (i.e., Japan and China). Only 2,667,000 kilos of light bulbs are allowed to be imported each year, but it is stipulated that at least 1,466,800 kilos should be imported from the Netherlands. Large towels must be imported from Europe, while small towels can be imported from other countries. Cosmetics are not restricted, but only 850,000 kilos of soap are allowed to be imported each year. Underwear, beer, glassware, cement, kerosene lamps, cooking utensils, pottery, ironware, etc. are all restricted. Seasoning powder, electric fans, tiles, toys, steel essence enamel, etc. are not restricted. All kinds of regulations are detailed, and it is not easy to understand them unless you are personally there. The inspection group is currently busy collecting materials, running around during the day and working late into the night to cope with the environment, in order to achieve a certain position in national diplomacy. Fortunately, the Chinese Consulate General in Batavia has conducted research on various issues and has quite sufficient information. Consul General Song has also made special efforts for this inspection group and has provided much assistance.</p>
<p>The Group Departs for Singapore on the 12th</p>
<p>According to the results of the negotiations between the group and the Dutch East Indies government, the oral talks between the two sides were very satisfactory. The Department of Economic Affairs is preparing a written reply, and generally everything is no problem. It is hoped that after the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group comes to the Dutch East Indies, trade relations between the two sides will gradually increase. In order to reciprocate the overseas Chinese, the group held a banquet at the Great East Restaurant on the evening of the 8th to thank the overseas Chinese from all walks of life. Consul General Song and more than 60 guests from all walks of life attended. During the banquet, Chief Gao Shiheng gave a speech, encouraging the overseas Chinese to support the central government and establish contacts with domestic industrial and commercial circles to jointly promote the sales of national products overseas. With the strength of 1.2 million overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, they will surely achieve considerable success. Leaders from various business circles also gave replies. The group boarded a ship for Singapore on the 12th. More than 100 people, including the Director of the Department of Economic Affairs, Dutch East Indies government officials, our country's Consul General Song, the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and overseas Chinese compatriots from all walks of life, went to the port to see them off and presented flower baskets. The situation was very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Native Cloth Merchants Appeal Against Overlapping Taxation Asking the Bureau of Consolidated Taxes to Refund the Original Consolidated Taxes in Order to Reduce Costs and Compete with Foreign Goods</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance has begun to abolish harsh and miscellaneous taxes. It has been found that the house rent in various counties, the ash rent surcharge in Taishan, the brick rent surcharge, the export cattle and pig donations in Yingde, Qiongya, and Huiyang, the theater surcharge in Foshan, and the fishing tax in various counties have all been abolished separately. However, the export tax on native cloth, the only industry in the province, has not been exempted. It has been found that the old-style native cloth in Guangdong Province, such as summer cloth, red cloth, and ramie cloth, is mostly produced in Xingning and Chao'an. Machine-woven native cloth is mostly exported from Guangzhou Henan and Foshan. The former is transported and sold to various provinces and cities in the country, while the latter is sold to Nanyang and other places. Because imported cloth is dumped, the sales of native cloth have stagnated. As a result, the number of unemployed male and female workers who live by weaving cloth is almost 70% or 80%. The Guangdong native cloth industry has become like a dying ember. General native cloth merchants believe that at this time of decline in the native cloth industry, the government should take measures to provide relief. However, the customs still levies export tax on native cloth, which is a major blow to the export of native cloth. Repeated requests for exemption have not been approved. The Guangzhou Native Cloth Industry Association recently stated that according to the Ministry of Finance's regulations, if native cloth is woven from raw materials that have already paid consolidated tax and is transported for export after paying export tax, the consolidated tax can be refunded. It presented a petition to the Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian Regional Bureau of Consolidated Taxes, requesting a tax refund. The original petition stated: "The petition is for already taxed and re-taxed, forming a double tax. We sincerely request that you grant a duty-free certificate and refund the consolidated tax to facilitate transportation and sales. We have secretly investigated that the cotton yarn used by pure weaving factories in Guangdong Province all comes from Shanghai. Only a small number of them are imported from overseas. When they are transported to Guangdong, they have already paid consolidated tax in Shanghai. The yarn from overseas also pays tax upon entry. Guangdong has no commercial yarn factories. Therefore, there is actually no cotton yarn in Guangdong Province that has not paid consolidated tax. All weaving factories under the association have little capital and buy cotton yarn in small quantities from yarn merchants, so it is impossible to obtain the original cotton yarn tax payment certificate. When the woven cloth is reported for export, because there is no original cotton yarn tax payment certificate, they must pay customs duties and cannot refund the original cotton yarn consolidated tax as usual, resulting in double taxation. In the past, your bureau considered the special circumstances of Guangdong Province and agreed to present a petition to the Customs Tax Division. Your bureau would stamp the export declaration form and release it duty-free. Your bureau issued the 39th order on March 24th of the 20th year to comply with this. It has been implemented for several years. Because the original consolidated tax cannot be refunded, there is a slight loss, but it is also convenient to be released duty-free. Since August 21st of this year, the Guangdong Customs suddenly charged 3 yuan and 90 cents per 100 kilograms of machine-woven native cloth reported for export. After repeated negotiations, they all said that they were handling it according to the tax administration's order and refused to make any concessions. We believe that all civilized countries in the world are doing their best to maintain foreign trade, reduce costs as much as possible, so as to compete with foreign goods and relieve unemployment among domestic people. Now, the cost of exporting native cloth from Guangdong to foreign countries is higher than that of selling it in the mainland. Is this the government's original intention to encourage exports and protect the industry? Moreover, the Guangdong weaving industry has been affected by the pressure of foreign goods dumping, the social depression, and the bankruptcy of rural areas in recent years. Its only chance of survival depends on the enthusiastic promotion of domestic products and the export of native cloth by overseas Chinese in Nanyang and other places, thus occupying a slight position. The association is planning to lead its members to work hard to improve exports and find ways to request the government to provide relief and allow the original cotton yarn consolidated tax to be refunded as usual to reduce costs so as to compete with foreign goods and live up to the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese in loving domestic goods. However, before the aforementioned goals have been achieved, the Guangdong Customs has added an export tax on native cloth, which increases costs under this double taxation. If no measures are taken to provide relief, the last chance of the Guangdong native cloth industry to export will be destroyed. For this reason, we earnestly request you to investigate and approve a flexible solution to the special circumstances of weaving factories in Guangdong Province, allow the export of native cloth to refund the original cotton yarn consolidated tax based on the weight of the tax payment certificate, or grant a special exemption from the export duty on native cloth as before, so as to avoid double taxation and save the Guangdong native cloth industry. Then hundreds of thousands of native cloth industrialists and merchants will be grateful." Respectfully presented to the Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian Regional Bureau of Consolidated Taxes.</p>

<p>Implementation of Drug Inspection and Compulsory Rehabilitation</p>
<p>In our county, the number of morphine addicts in the Eighth District exceeds 20,000. In order to completely eliminate drug addicts, the county government previously formulated implementation measures and submitted them to the provincial government for approval. Now, in accordance with the regulations, a drug rehabilitation center will be established in Datuan Town in the Eighth District, and a general team for reporting drug addicts will be organized at the same time. A deadline of three months is set, and the County Public Security Bureau is responsible for handling drug inspection matters. The bureau has organized seven companies and stationed them in Chenxiang, Datuan Town, Nicheng, Wanxiang, Bujia Shop, and Laogang. The bureau also stated that since all the drug inspectors in each team are male, there will be difficulties if they encounter women during inspections. Therefore, female drug inspectors will be set up in each team to specialize in searching and inspecting female drug addicts. Seven people have been recruited and assigned to each team. Today (18th), the drug rehabilitation center will open in Datuan. County Magistrate Zhang and Standing Committee Chen will personally preside over it. From the 19th, all drug inspection teams will start working. Anyone found to be a drug addict will be sent to the drug rehabilitation center for compulsory rehabilitation to break their addiction and will be exempted from punishment. If they commit the crime again, they will be severely punished according to law and will not be tolerated.</p>

<p>Zhou, the chief of the Second District of the Water Public Security Bureau of She Su, dispatched a team to join forces with the Water Public Security Bureau of the First District and the Zhejiang Water Police Team to suppress lake bandits. Zhou himself also led a guerrilla team to supervise the teams and search for bandits in Yangcheng and Dianshan Lakes. The day before yesterday evening, Chief Zhou patrolled from Dianshan Lake to Yangcheng Lake by steamboat and encountered three bandit boats. The bandits, seeing the steamboat in front of them, knew it was the police and turned around and fled. The police chased them to the Huayangpu area of Weiting. It was already dark. The bandits abandoned their boats and landed on the shore, hiding in the rice fields. When the police tracked them down, the bandits opened fire first, and the police also fired. During the exchange of fire, nearby villagers reported the alarm. Seeing the situation was not good, the bandits fled. The police searched for a long time but did not find them. They found an empty boat left by the bandits, with no one in it. They only found two earthen guns, one opium pipe, six flashlights, and some scattered items such as cigarettes in the boat. They took them all back to the district yesterday and continued to gather police teams from all over Dianshan Lake and set off again to search and suppress them.</p>

<p>Eighth District Suffers from Rice Stem Borer Disaster Again</p>
<p>The area in the Eighth District of this county is mostly planted with late rice due to its low-lying terrain. After the area suffered from a rice stem borer disaster last year, the losses were heavy. Later, the province ordered the agricultural extension institute to be responsible for cleaning it up. At that time, due to the change of county magistrates, no one supervised it, and the borer removal work was not carried out as planned. Unexpectedly, when the rice was about to mature recently, it happened again this autumn because the borer eggs were not removed last year. The borer specializes in entering the rice stems, resulting in empty hearts that turn white and die. Now, countless numbers of Lizhi and Renyang towns in the area have suffered this damage. They have reported the disaster to the district office one after another. The district chief believes that the reports from each household are true and has telegraphed the county government on their behalf, requesting that personnel be sent to inspect the situation.</p>

<p>Selling Counterfeit Drugs Being Investigated</p>
<p>The Xinsheng Pharmacy on Beimenwai Daqiao Street in this county is jointly owned by Wang Huaisheng and others. Its business has been good on weekdays, but it has been secretly selling counterfeit Sandelmidine tablets, which has been very profitable. The New China Foreign Firm, the general manager's office of the pills stationed in Shanghai, found out about this and sent a French employee, Pang Jiadun (transliteration), and a translator, Liu Xiqin, from Shanghai to Wuxi the day before yesterday to purchase a bottle of counterfeit Sandelmidine from the pharmacy. Pang and Liu, with conclusive evidence, immediately reported to the Public Security Bureau and requested that personnel be sent to search the pharmacy. Director Zhang, upon receiving the report, ordered Inspector Zhang Houyu to lead the police to inspect the pharmacy. They found a bottle of counterfeit medicine, a bottle of medicine pills without packaging paper, and a bottle of real medicine in the cabinet. They were all taken to the bureau for investigation.</p>

The Improvement Zone immediately announced that cocoon merchants should go to the zone to register by the 18th. There were still 36 stove quotas remaining. The Cocoon Industry Association originally scheduled to start weighing on September 23, but a few cocoon merchants started weighing on the 18th because the autumn cocoons had already entered the market. The price of cocoons was around 25 to 30 yuan per load. The goods have not yet peaked. In two or three days, all the cocoon merchants in the county will start weighing, and the cocoon market will improve.</p>

<h3>Correspondence</h3>
<p>Letter from the Palace Museum</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: During the inventory of the Qianliang (money and grain) warehouse on the 14th of this month, the following items were found to be missing: item number 228, sub-number 2: 29 pieces of broken gemstones; item number 3: 30 pieces of broken gemstones; item number 5: one piece of purple garnet; item number 6: 16 pieces of turquoise; item number 9: one jade Ruyi scepter inlaid with three precious stones, with a box; item number 10: two coral branches, with a box; item number 12: one arched jade screen. After checking the handover records regarding the theft case involving Run Chang, the leader of the former Internal Affairs Department's resident guards at the museum, and the clerk Fang Jiqing, dating back to the 17th year [of the Republic], and after reviewing the lost item inventory of the Qianliang warehouse theft case, the missing items from sub-number 7 were all recorded. However, the list of missing items at that time was not limited to these. Further items will likely be discovered during subsequent inventories. It was found that in the old theft cases, some items were not re-examined at the time, resulting in the absence of a loss list for the stolen items in the records. Furthermore, due to the replacement of exhibits, loss of item tags, and relocation of items during the southward movement, after the change of museum directors in July of the 22nd year, a request was submitted to the Executive Yuan to dispatch personnel to oversee the inventory. This year, various organizations were also requested to send personnel to serve as temporary supervisors for the inventory to ensure impartiality. Once the entire inventory is completed, it will be carefully compared with the previous inventory reports and old records to obtain an accurate count of the items that are present or missing. Therefore, the inventory conducted in recent years, while representing the handover by the current director, also serves as a comprehensive investigation. As for the missing items from the Qianliang warehouse, silver warehouse, Cining Palace Garden, Imperial Workshop, Internal Affairs Department Hall, Jingqi Pavilion, Yongshou Palace, and other locations, they were all stolen in cases dating back to before the 17th year [of the Republic]. A thorough investigation should be completed soon. In order to prevent the outside world from mistakenly believing that theft is occurring at present, this detailed explanation is provided. It is hoped that it will be published in your newspaper to clarify the truth. Sincerely, National Beiping Palace Museum. September 15th, 25th year [of the Republic].</p>

<h3>Bogomolov Hosts Banquet for Chiang Tingfu Last Night; China-Soviet Cultural Association Afternoon Tea Party Yesterday; Both Ambassadors Chiang and Bogomolov Deliver Speeches</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the newly appointed Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Chiang Tingfu, has been busy with social engagements since arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday, there were also the Saturday Club and banquets hosted by the China-Soviet Cultural Association and the Soviet Ambassador. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Banquet from All Circles</p>
<p>Yesterday at noon, the "Saturday Club," an amateur organization of Mayor Wu and leaders from all walks of life, held a banquet at the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road to honor Chiang. Mayor Wu, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, Qian Xinzhi, and fifty to sixty other people were in attendance. Chiang delivered a speech on the spot, and the gathering ended joyfully at around 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Cultural Association Tea Party</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the China-Soviet Cultural Association and the Columbia University Alumni Association in the United States, represented by Jiaotong University President Li Zhaohuan, held a tea party at the New Asia Hotel on Tiantong Road from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon to bid farewell to Chiang. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Soviet Ambassador Bogomolov, First Secretary of the Soviet Embassy Saratov Chifu, Meramid, Chinese Secretary E Shan Yin, Military Attaché Lei Er, Commercial Representative En Qin, Deputy Consul in Shanghai Xie Manski, and representatives from the cultural and educational circles He Bingsong, Liu Zhan'en, Cao Liang, Wu Qingyou, Zhou Gucheng, Zhu Maocheng, Ou Yuanhuai, Wu Yun Chu, Zheng Shixu, Weng Zhilong, Yan Fuqing, Wang Yachen, Wei Ke, Jiao Jihua, Xiao Youmei, Wang Zhixin, and over seventy other people were present. Li delivered a speech first, reporting the significance of the reception and briefly describing the past work and future hopes of the China-Soviet Cultural Association.</p>
<p>Chiang and Bogomolov's Speeches</p>
<p>Then, Chiang stood up and delivered a speech, saying, "China and the Soviet Union are both vast countries with abundant resources and a long history and culture. Both countries are currently under construction and both advocate peace and do not wish to dominate others. Although the political and economic systems of the two countries are different, it must be understood that this is like people having different preferences, which does not prevent them from becoming good friends. The establishment of the China-Soviet Cultural Association can promote friendly relations between the two countries from a national standpoint, which is truly helpful to us." Soviet Ambassador Bogomolov then spoke, saying that the friendly relations between the two countries are based on mutual understanding, and the work of understanding is greatly related to culture. Therefore, I feel that the China-Soviet Cultural Association is extremely important. Mutual understanding between China and the Soviet Union will maintain world peace. This is not only a blessing for the two countries, but also a blessing for the world. I would like to take this opportunity to mention one thing: recently, German newspapers and news agencies have spread various rumors, such as the famine in Soviet Ukraine this year, conflicts between the army and the people, etc. I have already issued a statement to the Chinese press refuting these false statements. Previously, Chinese newspapers had published a statement by the Acting People's Commissar of Agriculture of Ukraine, Guguievsky, with statistics proving the falsity of the rumors. Finally, I must say that your country's former Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Dr. Yan (Huiqing), was stationed in the Soviet Union for three years and had a harmonious relationship with the officials and people of our country. He has laid a considerable foundation for Sino-Soviet relations. I believe that Ambassador Chiang will be able to promote and enhance it even more after taking office."</p>
<p>Li's Reply</p>
<p>Then, Shanghai University President Liu Zhan'en, representing the Columbia University Alumni Association in the United States, delivered a speech, saying that Ambassador Chiang had lofty ambitions during his study abroad years. Now that he has been appointed as ambassador to the Soviet Union, he has the opportunity to develop his abilities. We will certainly help him succeed with our spirit, etc. Finally, Li Zhaohuan replied, presenting three points, hoping that Ambassador Chiang will introduce more Soviet culture back to China in the future, and introduce Chinese culture to the Soviet Union. Some people from the China-Soviet Cultural Association plan to go to the Soviet Union for observation and speeches. He hopes that Ambassador Chiang will contact the Soviet government on his behalf after taking office.</p>
<p>Bogomolov's Hospitality</p>
<p>Soviet Ambassador to China Bogomolov hosted a banquet for Ambassador Chiang at 8:30 PM last night at his official residence inside the consulate on Huangpu Road, as the first official social event. Mayor Wu, Zhou Jue, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Office in Shanghai, Yan Fuqing, Li Zhaohuan, leaders from all walks of life, and members of the Soviet embassy were also invited to attend. There was an exchange of views during the banquet, and the discussion was very pleasant. The gathering ended happily at around 9:00 PM. Chiang is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 11:00 PM express train tonight to receive his credentials, await instructions from President Chiang, and then return to his ancestral home in Baoqing, Hunan. He will come to Shanghai at the end of next month and take a ship to Vladivostok to take office, accompanied by his wife and two sons.</p>

<h3>Li Zhongchu Returns to Shanghai to Discuss Hunan Rice Transportation to Guangdong, 7 Million Dan Per Year</h3>
<p>The rice market in this city is gradually becoming active as early and late rice harvests successively enter the market. The Hunan rice transportation to Guangdong issue, which has attracted national attention, has been completed. Li Zhongchu, manager of the Bank of Communications, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. It is reported that 7 million dan can be sent to Guangdong each year. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Hunan Rice Transportation to Guangdong</p>
<p>According to investigations, Guangdong Province imports 10 million dan of foreign rice per year (each dan is 100 catties). Hunan Province has a surplus of 4 million to 5 million shi of rice in bumper years (each shi is 150 catties), equivalent to 6 million to 7 million dan of foreign rice. Guangdong Province originally declined Hunan rice because it did not suit the taste of the Guangdong people. However, through the advocacy and promotion of the heads of the construction departments of Hunan and Guangdong provinces, this difficulty has been completely eliminated.</p>
<p>Concrete Measures</p>
<p>The sales and transportation methods discussed by the two provinces were formulated by Yu Jichuan, head of the Hunan Construction Department, Liu Weichi, head of the Guangdong Construction Department, and Li Zhongchu, representative of the Bank of Communications. Li returned to Shanghai on a China Airlines plane yesterday to report the concrete plan this morning, with the aim of standardizing quality, reducing costs, facilitating transportation and sales, supplying in large quantities, and using financial, scientific, and political forces to promote it together. What has already been implemented is that Hunan rice is completely transported to Guangdong, exempting all miscellaneous taxes, reducing railway fees by half of the normal rate, and for ships (under the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company), Li has negotiated with the China Merchants Bureau for those entering Shantou. Guangdong and Shantou merchants have formed a transportation and sales company.</p>
<p>Improving Hunan Rice</p>
<p>For the improvement of Hunan rice quality, A. Production: (1) Organize cooperatives. Farmers initially form credit cooperatives. (2) Establish district and central agricultural warehouses. (3) Guide private boats to form private boat transportation cooperatives to undertake short-distance transportation between district and central agricultural warehouses. (4) Train rural workers. B. Transportation and sales: (1) Form a large-scale rice transportation company and establish Hunan rice transportation liaison offices in Changsha, Guangzhou, and Shantou, with three groups for agency affairs, introductions, mortgages, and settlements. (2) Establish new-style rice storage warehouses in Guangzhou and Shantou, with a standard storage capacity of 500,000 shi, and establish rice mills with a standard milling capacity of 10,000 shi per day, operating throughout the year. (3) Finance: Request banks to allocate low-interest loans at any time, the amount depending on the need (the previous proposal of a 6 million yuan allocation by the Bank of Communications in conjunction with the China Agricultural Credit Syndicate was only a proposal by Hunan Province). (4) Politics: Strict inspection. The Ministry of Industry should set up main agencies in Changsha, Hengyang, Zhuzhou, Lukou, and other places, and set up sub-offices or commissioners as appropriate to strictly prohibit adulteration and mixing, with quality grading attached. Currently, the most suitable rice for Guangdong sales is tentatively divided into four types: oil machine Special Grade, Tian Grade, Di Grade, and Ren Grade.</p>
<p>Local Rice Market</p>
<p>In the past, Hunan rice market prices were all based on Shanghai and Hankou markets. Now it has been decided to open an independent market price report in Guangdong Province every day. Rice merchants in this city and Hubei and Anhui provinces are worried that Hunan rice transportation to Guangdong will affect the markets in various places. The Huadong News Agency reporter investigated and found that there is no problem because Hubei and Anhui provinces also have the possibility of joint transportation. The local rice market is gradually becoming optimistic due to the successive entry of early and late rice into the market. The import of foreign rice has now disappeared.</p>

However, this distribution license can only be used for transporting goods from Location A to Location B. After arrival, it must be handed over and canceled. If Location B wants to resell these goods to Location C, and then transport them from Location C to Location D, there is neither a customs transportation license nor a chamber of commerce distribution license. Military police along the way are bound to misunderstand. As such, there is no clear provision in the regulations for examination, so it is impossible to explain. Correspondingly, we hereby write, and would like to request a reply regarding how to handle these matters,' etc. After examination, the examination of what the Chamber of Commerce has requested to be interpreted is not clearly defined in the regulations. The matter concerns laws and regulations, so we dare not act on our own authority. What to do with the place that should be handled is hereby reported to the higher authorities for instructions," etc. The supplementary measures are now stipulated as follows: "For goods that have a distribution license, if they still need to be transported to other places for distribution after arriving at the designated destination, they should report the goods to the local trade association or chamber of commerce upon arrival, with the original distribution license, for verification and registration. When they are transported to other places for distribution, they should request the trade association or chamber of commerce to issue a distribution license according to Article 6 of the transportation and sales regulations for transportation. The same method applies to those who repeatedly transport to other places. (The style of this distribution license will be determined later.) In addition to the distribution, we hereby request that you check and forward it to the following for compliance,” etc. As such, besides distributing the order, we are sending out a copy of the license style for you to be notified and to inform the city’s Chamber of Commerce for their knowledge.

<h3>Report from Gansu Province: Hopes for Investment and Cultivation in the Border Region; Vast Land and Sparse Population Lead to Foreign Covetousness; It is Imperative to Seize the Opportunity for Development to Remedy the Situation</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that municipal authorities in various provinces have recently become increasingly aware that the growing number of unemployed people within their jurisdictions has had a significant impact on social economy and local security. They generally believe that the best way to alleviate this unemployment panic is to transport the unemployed to the border regions for cultivation. The border regions such as the Northwest have vast lands and sparse populations. Border authorities and local people also hope that the unemployed from the interior will quickly go to cultivate. A Central News Agency reporter yesterday met Mr. Zhang, a friend who had just returned to Shanghai from Gansu, who told him the following:</p>
<p>Vast Land and Sparse Population: Inviting Covetousness</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang has worked in the transportation sector in Gansu for four years. In his spare time, he has paid attention to investigating local customs. According to him, the northwestern border provinces have vast areas, several times larger than the southeastern provinces, but the population is sparse. In remote areas, one can walk for dozens of miles without seeing a single person. As a result, the land is barren. The land is full of gold but no one to collect it, which has aroused foreign covetousness. In recent years, border incidents have occurred from time to time. Although the reasons are different, the vast land and sparse population, which aroused foreign covetousness, is the biggest factor. Moreover, the sparse population in the border region violates the principle of national defense. Therefore, to consolidate the border region, we must first encourage immigration.</p>
<p>Local Hopes: Investment and Cultivation</p>
<p>The border provinces and regions, due to the backwardness of culture and economy, deeply hope that people from the interior will go to invest and develop. Although the slogan of calling for investment in the interior has been repeatedly heard in the Shanghai banking community, it has not yet benefited the border region. The people of the country know the wealth of the Northwest and other places, so they are eager for the financial and industrial circles of Shanghai to go and invest. At the same time, the local people also deeply know that to prosper the local area, the population must be increased. In the southeast and other places, due to the sluggish market, there are too many people for too few jobs, and there is often an unemployment panic. The border region is suffering from a sparse population. The unemployed in the interior can go to cultivate, which can solve the unemployment panic, prosper the border area, and consolidate national defense. It is a win-win situation.</p>
<p>Rich Profits and Convenient Transportation</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang also said that the Northwest border region is rich in resources and should set up industries and factories. The price of goods and raw materials in the border region is very low. Manufacturing goods locally for export can greatly reduce costs and make rich profits. Moreover, transportation facilities in the Northwest have also gradually developed in recent years, and transportation will not be greatly affected. If people in the interior can go to cultivate in groups, the local area will gradually prosper, and transportation facilities will also inevitably develop. It can be asserted that if everyone waits for the border transportation to be convenient before investing and cultivating, the border region will never be developed.</p>
<p>Current Key Point: Setting Up Information Centers</p>
<p>The customs and customs of the border area are very similar to those of the interior, and immigrants will not feel great inconvenience when they go there. In order to facilitate the people of the interior to start in the border area, I think we should set up information centers in Shanghai, Nanjing and other places for the people of the interior to inquire about various matters when going to the border area, such as the route, expenses, customs of the border area, living conditions, etc. This information center should contain an introduction. Those who go there will not hesitate to move forward after receiving this introduction before departure. At the same time, I also hope that state-owned transportation agencies will give preferential treatment to people going to the border area in terms of travel expenses, etc.</p>
<h3>Incidents Involving Jianghai Steamships</h3>
<p>Sanxing</p>
<p>The Sanxing Shipping Company's Sanxing ship, loaded with goods from Tianjin to Shanghai on the 16th. It did not leave Dagu until 2:00 AM, but because of the low water level, it ran aground in front of Pier No. 6. The hull hit the pier, damaging one of the teeth of the pier and destroying one of the customs buoys there, resulting in great losses. After the accident, people have been sent to inspect the ship. The ship was only able to get out of the ground and set sail when the tide rose that night. There was a telegram to Shanghai yesterday reporting the incident.</p>
<p>Youmu</p>
<p>The Youmu ship of the China United Wharf Warehouse Company, loaded with 1,400 tons of salt in Haizhou, and sailed to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. On the 18th, when the ship arrived 40 miles downstream of Shashi, the river was at low tide, and the ship was heavily loaded, it suddenly ran aground. The ship was drafting 15 feet, and the bottom of the ship was stuck in the mud and could not be moved. The shipowner telegraphed the Shanghai company for help. The company has agreed with Sanbei Company. Fortunately, the small Sanbei ship was unloading its cargo in Yichang. Yesterday, the company had rented the small Sanbei ship to rush to the downstream of Shashi to rescue the ship and unload the salt. The daily rent is 800 yuan. Youmu plans to wait until all the salt in the cabins is unloaded before dragging the ship out of the ground.</p>
<p>Jiang'an</p>
<p>The Jiang'an ship of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which was loaded with cargo from the Pinghan Railway, sailed from Hankou to Shanghai and had to be unloaded at the new wharf in Yangjiadu. When the ship was docking, it was just in time for the high tide (it was during the Great Tide period), and the water was rapid and the waves were huge. The hull was forced to avoid the small ships on the Huangpu River, and it collided with the Yangjiadu Wharf, damaging one or two floating bridges on the wharf at that time. After the accident, it was reported to the bureau yesterday, and the head office has sent people to inspect the wharf and prepare for repairs.</p>
<p>Tonghe</p>
<p>The Tonghe ship of the Dalu Industrial Company collided with the Shen'ai ship of the Yilong Foreign Company near Zhenjiang. The Tonghe ship was severely damaged, the pulley of the steering gear has been broken, the screws on the right side of the front hull have been loosened, and it has been stranded for four days. The technicians sent there could not repair it, and the front cabin has been flooded with one inch per hour. The salt in the ship has been damaged. After receiving the telegram from Shanghai, Mr. Fang, the director of Dalu Shipping, went to Zhenjiang to inspect the ship and discuss rescue methods. The shipowner is a Russian, Vinoscov. Dalu Company, because the Western shipowner of the Chunhe ship was replaced by the Chinese, Huang Yajun, the technology and driving skills are better than the Westerners. Tonghe ship also plans to use Chinese people, but unexpectedly, it has already caused trouble and suffered great damage.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Enthusiastically Support the Purchase of Aircraft</h3>
<p>The whole city's district map and land preservation donations for the purchase of aircraft to celebrate the birthday are in full swing.

<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau Captures the Murderer in the Xuan Sheng Case; The Main Culprit Wang Zhensheng and Mao Yonghu Zhao Yunpeng; The Murder Weapon Handgun Has Also Been Obtained and Proven</h3>
<p>According to a Central News Agency report, the person in charge of the Municipal Public Security Bureau stated yesterday that after the Xuan Sheng case of the Japanese resident occurred on July 10 of this year, the municipal government ordered the Public Security Bureau to arrest the murderer and pay special attention to protecting Japanese residents. After receiving the order, the bureau repeatedly ordered its subordinates to widely purchase information and set a time limit for solving the case. It also offered a heavy reward in order to capture the murderer as soon as possible. Last month, several suspects who had premeditated the assassination were arrested. The interrogation revealed that they were related to the Xuan Sheng Zhongshan case. They were temporarily handed over to the Public Concession Police Department for investigation for reference. Later, the Police Department sent them back to the bureau. On the one hand, the bureau resumed tracking down other clues, and on the 15th and 16th of this month, it successively arrested the main criminals Mao Yonghu and Zhao Yunpeng in the case in Nanshi. According to the confession, the main culprit Wang Zhensheng was still living in Zhabei. The bureau then sent detectives to capture Wang at his address at midnight on the 17th. After taking him back to the bureau, he was interrogated. He revealed that the murder weapon handgun was thrown into the garbage pile under the Hu Family Wooden Bridge near Qimei Road. The bureau then sent personnel to accompany Wang to the Hu Family Wooden Bridge to retrieve the murder weapon handgun. The bureau then sent personnel to take the gun to the Public Concession Police Department for inspection. It was verified that the gun was a revolver handgun, using Brownell automatic pistol bullets, with six bullets loaded, one bullet had been fired, and the shell was still in the gun, and there were five unfired bullets. It was indeed the murder weapon handgun in the case.</p>
<h3>New Second Public Bus Route Opened in South Shanghai; Diesel Buses Will Be Used Starting Today; Running Between Shiliupu and Caohejing; Yesterday Invited All Sectors to Visit</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau's Public Bus Management Office has opened a new second bus route between Caohejing and Shiliupu, using new-style diesel public buses with exceptionally comfortable seating and affordable fares. The route is scheduled to open this morning. Yesterday, a special invitation was extended to all sectors to visit and try out the buses, with tea and refreshments served at the Huang Family Garden. During the event, Director Xu Peihuang of the bureau gave a report. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Inviting Guests</p>
<p>The city-run second public bus route is scheduled to open at 6:00 AM this morning. The Public Works Bureau and the Public Bus Management Office specially hosted a visit for all sectors at Huang Family Garden in Caohejing at 2:30 PM yesterday. The bureau provided 12 new-style diesel public buses to welcome and transport guests at the Heping Road Station in Laoximen. Yesterday happened to be Saturday afternoon, and the weather was fine, so many people went, totaling 300 people from political, business, and press circles. After arriving at Huang Family Garden, they first toured the garden for a week, and then tea and refreshments were served in the thatched cottage of Dalichun Restaurant. Director Xu Peihuang of the Public Works Bureau gave a report. The event ended at 4:00 PM, and the guests were transported back to Heping Road Station by the original buses and dispersed.</p>
<p>Xu's Report</p>
<p>Director Xu said at the reception, "Distinguished guests, the second Caohejing route will be opened today. I am honored to have your presence. Our bureau's public buses have been operating for two years. Taking advantage of the opening of the new route, we are holding this event at Huang Garden, providing some tea and refreshments to express our welcome and briefly report on the general situation of the past two years since the opening. Looking at the transportation tools in this city, except for the city ferries, most of them are commercially operated. Even the public buses in the South Shanghai area were previously commercially operated. However, due to poor management, they lost the trust of the citizens, resulting in failure. After that, the transportation in the Nanshi area became inconvenient again. Therefore, our bureau submitted a request to the municipal government to change to city-run buses. The intention is to supplement the inadequacy of existing transportation tools, and the premise is entirely to facilitate citizens' transportation. It is not for the purpose of making profits. Therefore, even when the city treasury is stretched, we still carry out this grand wish with determination. Fortunately, with the guidance of the mayor and the support of all sectors and car dealers, we were able to establish it. I should express my twelve-point gratitude. The Public Bus Management Office adopts strict scientific management in terms of personnel, affairs, and materials. For example, drivers, ticket sellers, and inspectors are all recruited through examinations and given appropriate training. Then, they are promoted and demoted step by step, so that service personnel have the desire to compete and improve work efficiency. For mechanical aspects, such as management, repair, and assembly, all three projects are supervised and handled by experienced supervisors, researched and improved without any slack. For the purchase and consumption of materials, accessories, and oil, there is also reasonable management and detailed statistics to ensure that no funds are wasted and to strive for frugality. Over the past two years, although we have established a foundation, there are still many shortcomings. I hope that all sectors will give us guidance." Xu continued, "After the establishment of the Public Bus Management Office, we first operated the first and third routes. The first route is an important traffic route between Laoximen and Longhua, especially during the spring incense season. The third route is a circular route around the city. The establishment of this route is to supplement the inadequacy of transportation tools on that route. Then, we added the fourth and eleventh routes. The fourth route is also a circular route, starting from Dapu Bridge, passing Lujiabang, Limallu, Minguo Road, and returning to the original Dapu Bridge. The establishment of this route is based on the fact that there are no transportation tools near Xieqiao west and Lujiabang Road, and citizens feel very inconvenient to travel. Therefore, we developed it to meet the needs. According to the latest statistics, the number of passengers on that route is increasing day by day, almost comparable to the third route. The eleventh route is Pudong Avenue, connecting the north and south traffic, and is intended to cross the Shangchuan and Shangnan transportation companies, so that passengers can reduce their wading. Since its opening, it has been well received by the citizens of Pudong. Now, in the new western district of South Shanghai in this city, the number of residents has been increasing in recent years. At the same time, many citizens who serve in the special zone live in Caohejing. Recently, gardens and factories in the Caohejing area have been increasing day by day. Every holiday, Chinese and Westerners traveling to the suburbs can be seen on the road. However, the lack of fast and convenient transportation tools is very inconvenient. A year ago, our bureau had the motive to add a route from Caohejing to Laoximen and Shiliupu. In order to reduce the burden on passengers, it is not economical to use gasoline vehicles for operation. Therefore, we decided to use diesel engines for the 12 new vehicles we added. As for how to make the appearance of the body and the interior of the car more beautiful, comfortable, and safe, we have researched and improved them to meet the expectations of the citizens. Today, we are honored to have guests from all walks of life come to visit, and we are grateful to Mr. Huang Jinyong, the owner of the garden, for generously lending his private garden as the place for our bureau's reception, as well as the general public and car dealers like Hejin Company for trusting our bureau and sincerely supporting us. I am extremely honored and would like to thank you all."</p>
<p>Low Fares</p>
<p>The vehicles used by the bureau are the Hejin Company's Da Mengtian new diesel engine vehicles (reportedly built by Dachang Machinery Factory). The body is wide, each weighing two tons and carrying four tons. The exterior is light blue and light yellow, while the interior is yellow, with deep blue curtains hanging down, which is very beautiful. The leather seats are also spacious and comfortable, and can carry 45 passengers. The cost of each vehicle is 15,000 yuan, and more than a dozen have been purchased, with ten dedicated to the new route. The route runs from Shiliupu, Limalu, Damatou Street, through Dadongmen, across the city, via Qiaojiabang Road, Ninghe Road, Penglai Road, out of Laoximen, to Xieqiao, along Xietu Road, to Jinji Road, detour via Xujiahui, and to Caohejing Town. The entire route is 21 kilometers long, divided into 12 stations, and it takes one hour for the car to reach. A bus runs every twelve minutes. The fare is 5 cents from Damatou to Xiaodongmen, 7 cents to Dadongmen, 9 cents to Qiaojiabang, 11 cents to Public Security Bureau, 13 cents to Laoximen, 18 cents to Xieqiao, 24 cents to Luban Road, 30 cents to Damuqiao, 36 cents to Jinji Road, 36 cents to Tianyao Bridge, 42 cents to Tianyao Bridge Road, 48 cents to Zhongshan Road, 54 cents to Cao's Cemetery, and 60 cents to Caohejing. It is also stipulated that the fare for each station east of Laoximen is 5 cents, and the fare for each station west of Laoximen is 6 cents.</p>

<h3>French National Stahl Trafficking Drugs, French Authorities Issue Arrest Warrant</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that earlier this month, a Chinese woman named Wen Mali was found to have concealed 48 pounds of morphine in a hidden compartment of her luggage while traveling from Shanghai to the United States, intending to smuggle it into Los Angeles. Upon the ship's arrival at the port, both the person and the contraband were seized. According to her confession, the morphine was supplied by Stahl of the Baolong Hospital in Shanghai. Stahl, a Frenchman from Alsace, has been working at Baolong Hospital as an inspector (mainland reports claim that he was the chief accountant) for many years. After news of Stahl's involvement in morphine smuggling came out, the hospital dismissed him from his position several days ago. His whereabouts are now unknown. Currently, the Public Concession, the French Concession, and the Shanghai Municipal Government's police authorities are all seeking to arrest him to investigate everything. They have been visiting various locations for days, but have not found any trace of him. It is now believed that he is still hiding in or near Shanghai and will likely be apprehended soon. Even if he flees to other cities, it will be difficult for him to escape justice, as authorities around the world are now paying attention to him. At the same time, authorities are also paying attention to other foreigners in Shanghai who are suspected of being involved in local morphine manufacturing plants and morphine supply sources. One suspect who recently died in Shanghai is said not to be part of the European drug trafficking group associated with Brandesstedter. Many members of that group, including Lian Bai, have recently fled Shanghai. One of them, Weis Muller, is reportedly in Central America, and the American authorities are currently tracking his whereabouts. The European group is financially strong and has been operating in Europe for six or seven years before its key figures fled to the East. Bai was the group's Far East manager in Shanghai. Its headquarters in New York has been operating for three years. In May of this year, Bai was forced to flee to Europe. Not long after, he secretly went to Cuba, but was expelled by Havana authorities at the end of August. He later committed suicide on the Orient Line's "Eastern" ship in New York Harbor on September 4. It is believed that Wen Mali's morphine smuggling case implicated him, and the California court intended to arrest and interrogate him. It is reported that the international opium and narcotic smuggling organization was broken up under the personal direction of the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. The discovery of Wen Mali's smuggling is part of this operation. The woman is Cantonese and was a nurse at Baolong Hospital. The retail value of the morphine she was carrying was $50,000 USD, enough for one million medicinal doses, enough to kill 500,000 people. The woman is currently awaiting trial. According to a telegram from the United States, she is suffering from a severe case of influenza. The woman has a younger sister who currently lives in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The "Great American Evening Post" reports that in the case of Wen Mali's morphine smuggling into the United States, in addition to the French national Stahl, who is involved in the case and has now fled, another foreigner is also implicated. The three police authorities in the city are currently hunting for him. Authorities do not want to announce his name or nationality, but it is known that he is not American and is believed to be hiding in Shanghai. Stahl was last seen on Friday night. The French Consulate issued a subpoena on Sunday, and because they could not find him, they issued an arrest warrant yesterday (the 18th) afternoon. Stahl is a middle-aged man, not yet married, six feet three inches tall, and very strong. He has worked at Baolong Hospital for fifteen years and currently earns a monthly salary of 700 yuan. He owns property in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Reuters, Los Angeles, September 19: The Chinese girl, Wen Mali, 24 years old, arrived here last month and was arrested for possessing 48 pounds of heroin, worth $50,000 USD, in a hidden compartment, and charged with smuggling contraband. The woman is currently suffering from a severe case of influenza and gastroenteritis, so the case has been postponed. Several days after the incident, the woman attempted to escape to Europe on the German ship "Deutschland," but was re-arrested when the ship arrived in New York.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County Opium Smokers' Fourth Term Licenses Expire at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Excluding those who have died, quit, moved, or whose whereabouts are unknown, there are only 661 licensed opium smokers in the fourth term in various districts of Shanghai County. Those who should have quit during the previous terms but failed to do so have been given a deadline to enroll in a rehabilitation program. The fourth term licenses will expire at the end of this month. The county government has now received an order from the Department of Civil Affairs to begin issuing fifth-term licenses from October 1st to November 30th. County Magistrate Li has instructed the opium suppression section to prepare for the process.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Zhao Yuxiang Relocates</h3>
<p>Since practicing law in Shanghai, Lawyer Zhao Yuxiang has been highly respected by his clients for his diligent handling of cases. Recently, for the convenience of his work, he has relocated his office to the fifth floor of the Yanye Bank on Beijing Road (telephone 14133) and continues to practice as usual.</p>

<h3>Dr. Ding Huikang Discusses Health Insurance Systems in Various Countries; China Health Care Society to Be Established Soon in Cooperation with the China Anti-Tuberculosis Association</h3>
<p>Dr. Ding Huikang, a medical committee member of the China Anti-Tuberculosis Association, advocates for health insurance. On the evening of the 17th of this month, he hosted a reception for people from all walks of life at the New Asia Hotel. Li Dachao, Pan Gongzhan, Li Tingan, Yu Bohong, Yu Guang, Fang Zhizhi, Zhang Jing, Dong Douyan, Li Xiamen, and others inquired about Dr. Ding's plan. Last year, he promoted the establishment of tuberculosis prevention agencies in various places. Without a sound health insurance system, it would be difficult to achieve its goals. This system is divided into two categories. One is public, for civil servants, employees, and others, who contribute 4% to 6% of their income as health insurance fees, with designated doctors and hospitals providing protection. The other is private, for self-employed individuals, housewives, children, and others, who can join freely and request family doctor consultations. Currently, in Germany, more than 20 million people participate in health insurance, costing approximately 1.5 billion marks annually. In the United States, it costs approximately 3.6 billion USD, averaging 30 USD per person. Russia has 2.5 billion rubles in social insurance fees. Japan's tuberculosis prevention funding is 3 million yuan, and the cost of health care is more than 30 million yuan. Looking at the progress of their nations, it is all due to the popularity of health insurance, which can concentrate considerable economic resources and have complete medical construction to succeed. On the other hand, focusing only on treating individuals will hinder medical construction without any progress, leading to the decline of the nation and its international standing. The degradation of medicine is a sign of decline. Taking tuberculosis prevention as an example, patients in our country are currently unable to afford medical treatment. At the same time, due to the lack of regular treatment in hospitals and sanatoriums, it cannot be popularized. Most patients have no knowledge and only rely on internal medicine as the only remedy, leading to a widespread epidemic. To reverse this situation, the only solution is to popularize health insurance, so that people have access to normal medical protection and the possibility of early diagnosis. More importantly, it is necessary to have statistics on diseases and mutations, which is of great significance for public health and prevention. Recently, countries such as Italy and Switzerland have implemented compulsory lung disease insurance, which has achieved considerable results. The reasons for the decline in Germany's lung disease mortality rate are (1) the progress of public health, (2) the progress of eugenics, and (3) the progress of specialized medical methods. The greatest reason is the precise organization of public insurance institutions and the suitability of their implementation regulations for hygiene. When I was in Europe, I researched with experts there, and we all agreed that it is suitable for social needs and should use the simplest method, starting from one unit, to establish the "China Health Care Society" to achieve the goals of prevention and medical protection. However, the matter is significant, and I hope that leaders from all walks of life will provide guidance and promotion. Over the years, I have spent more than 350,000 yuan on various medical construction projects, and I will continue to do my best to serve society. It is said that the China Anti-Tuberculosis Council will discuss cooperation issues.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Railway to Prepare for Express Train; Multiple Test Runs to Determine Speed; Implementation Expected in November</h3>
<p>After the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration laid double tracks on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, the train speed has gradually increased. In the current timetable, train No. 4 from Shanghai to Beijing and train No. 3 from Beijing to Shanghai take five hours and fifty minutes to complete the entire journey, making them the fastest passenger trains on the line. Now, the Ministry of Railways, to facilitate transportation on the line, has ordered the administration to prepare for the opening of an express train. The administration has ordered the Rolling Stock Department and the Engineering Department to determine the maximum possible speed, which is four hours and fifty minutes, and is drafting a timetable for approval by the ministry. Implementation is expected around November. The three departments are currently inspecting the tracks and locomotives to ensure that the project can be completed as scheduled.</p>
<h3>Director Shen Inspects the Gaogiao Seawall in Shanghai; Creates a Budget to Submit to the Municipal Government for Appropriation; Earthen Seawalls Easily Eroded, to Be Replaced with Square Stones</h3>
<p>The seawall in the Gaogiao area of Shanghai was damaged by the recent typhoon, with about five or six sections of the original earthen seawall being washed away by the waves and one or two sections breached. Shen Yi, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works, considered the seawall to be related to the safety of residents in the Pudong area of Shanghai, so he personally inspected the site with Xu Guansan, the director of the responsible section. In addition to sending more than 2,000 sacks to Gaogiao to block the breaches, the situation of the eroded earthen seawall was reported to the municipal government. The areas of the earthen seawall that need to be repaired have also been surveyed for budget preparation. A temporary budget will be submitted to the municipal government for appropriation and active repairs. According to Section Chief Xu, earthen seawalls are easily eroded, so the repairs will use stone as much as possible to ensure stability.</p>

<h3>Chen Mao Xian Abandons His Wife and Fails to Provide Support: Not Subsidizing Her Living Expenses or Welcoming Her Home</h3>
<p>Chen Mao Xian, a local resident of Xue Nong Di in the city, is thirty-three years old. His father owns property there, and he comes from a wealthy family. Twelve years ago, he married Zhu Bao Zhen, who is now thirty-two years old. Initially, their relationship was good, and they had two sons. Later, due to marital discord, Zhu developed a mental illness after being emotionally distressed, with intermittent episodes lasting for seven or eight years. As a result, she has been living with her mother's family for two years. She previously sued her husband for failing to provide support, and the court ruled that he should pay 18 yuan per month for her medical and living expenses. However, this year, he stopped paying again and requested a divorce. Zhu argued that she has become disabled and is clearly being maliciously abandoned, with no means of self-support. Her mother's family sent her back to Chen's home, but his father refused to let her in. Furthermore, Chen recently sold land and received 19,000 yuan, so he is not incapable of providing support. Zhu also filed a complaint with the prosecutor. After reviewing the situation, the prosecutor determined that Chen Mao Xian was indeed guilty of abandonment and initiated a public prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Shao held a court session. Zhu explained the previous circumstances. The defendant, Chen Mao Xian, stated, "I used to work as a staff member at the Datong Dyeing and Weaving Factory, earning only 20 yuan per month, but she insisted on 18 yuan, so I had to embezzle from the accounts. At the end of last year, I was unable to repay the money and was dismissed. That is why I am unable to pay this year. The money from the land sale is managed by my parents, and I do not have access to it." At this point, Prosecutor Tang attended the court and argued that Chen was not subsidizing his wife's living expenses or allowing her to return home. This disabled and frail woman had no way to support herself and should be punished according to the law. The judge declared the arguments closed and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 10:00 AM on the 25th.</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau Announces Found Boys and Girl</h3>

He is about three or four years old, has several small sores on his head, and is wearing a white short-sleeved shirt and pants, floral cloth shoes, and no socks. On September 18th, at 8:00 AM, according to Police Officer Zhao Hua Rong of the Xinguang Branch, an unnamed lost boy was found near the Bird Railway area. He is about five years old, has a shaved head, and is wearing a red and green striped cloth robe, black and white striped cloth pants, white socks, and black shoes.</p>
<p>On September 19th, at 11:00 AM, according to Police Officer Ding Delong of the Ximen Branch, an unnamed lost deaf-mute girl was found on Minguo Road.

<h3>Lu Guo Qin and Ma Li's Adultery Dispute Verdict: Each Tells Their Side of the Story, Ma Li Found Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Lu Guo Qin, a 21-year-old from Chongming, who works as a fruit shop clerk at Rong Tai at 1272 Route Lafayette (at the intersection of Route Ratard) in the French Concession, previously hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 District Court. He accused Ma Li, a local woman residing at No. 46, Lane 550, Route Albert, of extortion and attempted fraud. He claimed that he was seduced by Ma Li, had a relationship with her, and lived with her for two months. Due to lack of money, he was kicked out. On August 20th and September 4th, she allegedly incited gangsters to extort 500 yuan from his store, demanding payment or threatening to kill him on the street. He requested an investigation. The court, concerned about potential nationality issues with the defendant's name, instructed Judge Zhang Zhao Zuo to first summon the plaintiff to investigate the case and then schedule a hearing, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Zhang summoned both parties to the Criminal Court No. 2 for questioning. According to the plaintiff, Lu Guo Qin, after living with the defendant, he gave her 120 yuan the first time and 125 yuan the second time. She quickly spent it and asked him for more. When he refused because he had no money, she sent gangsters to extort 500 yuan from him, threatening to kill him on the street if he didn't pay. The defendant, Ma Li, stated that the plaintiff's claims were completely false and fabricated. She denied having a relationship with him, stating that his behavior was despicable, and he associated with gangsters, wanting her to marry him. When she refused, he repeatedly harassed her, and she reported him to the police. She claimed he only earned five yuan a month and could not possibly have given her large sums of money. She accused him of falsely accusing her and damaging her reputation, and she planned to file a countersuit, hiring lawyer Xu Wu Fang for her defense. After hearing the testimony of Gu Fu Cai, a witness presented by the plaintiff, the court found the plaintiff's claims to be unfounded and considered the report made to the police, concluding that the plaintiff's statements were untruthful. After hearing the arguments of lawyer Er Zao, the court immediately announced the verdict: Ma Li was found not guilty. A case of adultery dispute thus came to an end.</p>

<h3>The Escape and Re-Arrest of Red Pill King Little Shandong: Closing Arguments Concluded, Reasons for Qian Zu Pei's Dissatisfaction Heard, Verdict on the Afternoon of the 24th</h3>
<p>Red Pill King Little Shandong, also known as Qian Zu Pei, was previously arrested by the French police and sent to the Special No. 2 District Court for questioning. He was released on bail after paying 8,000 yuan in cash to await further investigation. However, Qian seized the opportunity to escape without a trace. The court ruled to confiscate his bail money and issued an arrest warrant. Only at the beginning of last month, French police detectives, in conjunction with the Laozha police, apprehended Qian at the Central Teahouse on Guangxi Road. He was handed over to the Special No. 2 District Court for public prosecution. After a trial, he was sentenced to four years in prison and fined 2,000 yuan, as previously reported. Qian, dissatisfied with the verdict, hired lawyer Wu Kai Sheng to file an appeal with the High Court Third Branch. The High Court, based on the petition, held a joint hearing yesterday in the Criminal Court No. 3, presided over by Judge Wu Ting Qi, along with Judges Liao and Wang Yue, and Prosecutor Dong Qi Ming. Lawyer Gu Shou Xi appeared in court on behalf of the Police Department. After the court questioned the appellant, Qian Zu Pei, in detail about the reasons for his dissatisfaction with the original verdict, and summoned police detective Bi as a witness, the closing arguments began. The court announced the conclusion of the arguments and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 24th. The appellant was returned to the detention center.</p>
<h3>Encouraging Investment, Embezzling 6,000 Yuan: Xu Long Yuan and Others' Malfeasance, Reported by Zhang Zhi Hui</h3>
<p>Xu Long Yuan, a local employee of the Da Kang Bank, has a brother-in-law named Chen Zi Yun, who is on good terms with Zhang Zhi Hui from Sichuan. Last year, Chen specifically encouraged Zhang to invest in opening a coal business in Shanghai, with Chen acting as the bookkeeper and depositing the funds with Xu at Da Kang Bank for transactions. However, Xu and Chen allegedly engaged in malfeasance. Zhang recently discovered that they had embezzled as much as 6,000 yuan through their collusion. Based on this information, the Laozha police sent detectives to No. 620 Zhejiang Road the day before yesterday and arrested Xu Long Yuan. Chen fled without a trace. Yesterday morning, Xu was sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Zhan Liang Ce conducted a preliminary hearing. Police lawyer Jiang Bao Lian briefly described the case and requested that Zhang be detained for further investigation of Xu's fraudulent activities.

<h3>Small Ferry Rams Wharf Boat: Rotten Iron Sinks to the Bottom of the River</h3>
<p>The water police have not received a report. Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, a wharf boat fully loaded with scrap iron was sailing on the outer part of the river near the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. wharf at Jia Jia Jiao in Pudong when it was suddenly rammed by a small ferryboat, causing it to capsize. All the scrap iron sank to the bottom of the river, and the boat itself overturned. As of late at night, the Customs Water Police had not received a report from the owner of the damaged boat, so the extent of the damage, any casualties, and the name of the ferryboat responsible are still unknown. The police have dispatched detectives to investigate the incident.</p>
<h3>Yun Automobile Branch Station: Oil Tank Lid Explodes, Loud Noise Disturbs Fire Department</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, at the Yunfei Automobile Company branch station near the intersection of Guangdong Road and Sichuan Road, the station's oil tank had a slight leak. A repairman was sent to fix it. When he removed the tank lid, the force was so strong that it caused a loud explosion, startling the neighbors. The Central Fire Department, hearing the noise and assuming it was a nearby explosion, immediately dispatched rescue vehicles to search the area. After a detailed investigation, they discovered the cause of the noise and returned, ending the false alarm.</p>
<h3>Special No. 2 District Court: Yesterday's Hearing on the Hongxing Factory Workers' Strike, Wang Xiu Ying Sues Li Ming Nai, Thirteen Female Workers Testify in Court</h3>
<p>The Hongxing Socks Factory at No. 221, Route des Sœurs, French Concession, recently fired workers, leading to a conflict on the morning of the 9th of this month, resulting in injuries to sixteen female workers, including Wang Xiu Ying. Mediation by party and government agencies failed to resolve the situation. The factory manager, Li Ming Nai, filed a complaint with the French police accusing fifteen female workers, including Wang Xiu Ying, of obstructing freedom, property damage, and assault. Sixteen female workers, including Wang Xiu Ying, also requested the Special No. 2 District Court Procuratorate to examine their injuries and filed a private prosecution against the Hongxing factory manager Li Ming Nai and employees Xia De Pei, Le Shun Ting, and Shi Ji Fu for assault. The public prosecution case of Li Ming Nai accusing Wang Xiu Ying and others of obstructing freedom, property damage, and assault was heard by Judge Sun Peng Xian in the Criminal Court No. 8 of the Special No. 2 District Court several days ago. Due to the Police Department's incomplete investigation, an extension was requested and granted, as reported in this newspaper. The case of Wang Xiu Ying suing Hongxing factory manager Li Ming Nai was heard by Judge Wang Gang Xu of the Special No. 2 District Court in the Criminal Court No. 1 yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Both parties arrived with their lawyers. First, the plaintiff Wang Xiu Ying stated that she was injured on the morning of the 9th due to a dispute with female worker Li A Si the day before regarding work. On the morning of the 9th, when she entered the factory to work, a police officer named Wang pushed her down, preventing her from working, and dragged her to the accounting room. Le Shun Ting and Shi Ji Fu shouted and beat her, stating that Li Ming Nai was responsible. Her body is still not fully recovered, and she is still taking medication. The other thirteen workers, including Kang Xiu Zhen, Zhang Hui Zhen, Zhang Xiu Ying, Sun A Ju, Zhang Feng Xian, Wang Chun Mei, Zhou Lin Bao, Lu Qin Xian, Chen Zhao Di, Zhu Xing Hua, Jin A Qin, Wei Xing Xian, and Ge Yu Shu, gave similar testimonies as Wang Xiu Ying. Li Ming Nai, Xia De Pei, Le Shun Ting, and Shi Ji Fu all denied committing the assault or inciting others to do so. The lawyers for both parties stated that the case was currently under mediation. The court reviewed the statements and ordered a postponement of the hearing to the 28th.</p>

They also claimed that 200 yuan was deducted from the compensation. They requested an investigation. After repeated hearings and the testimony of Maxi, the arguments were concluded. Yesterday, Judge Zhang announced the verdict, stating that Chen Xi Zhu's prosecution did not comply with the private prosecution procedure and rejected the private prosecution.</p>

The patrol police reported to the fire department, which dispatched fire trucks to extinguish the fire. It took an hour to put out the fire, which destroyed the entire building.

<h3>Doctor at Labor Hospital Accused of Negligence Causing Injury: Explanation</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, yesterday's newspaper reported that Tang Li Wen accused a doctor at the Labor Hospital of negligence causing injury. According to the hospital, on the 4th of this month, Tang Wang Shi's son, Da Shi Zi, went to the hospital for treatment. Dr. Zhang Xiu Yu of the hospital diagnosed the child with pinworms (not dysentery) and prescribed five packets of pinworm medicine. At 7:30 PM that evening, Tang Wang Shi brought her son Da Shi Zi back to the hospital, saying that when the child took the medicine, he spit it out on his neck because he didn't want to swallow it, and it caused an ulcer. After the hospital re-examined the child, they confirmed that the medicine on his body would not have caused such a reaction. They also mixed the medicine with warm water and tested it, and there were no other changes. (The newspaper reported that three packets were taken away, but this was likely a mistake, as one packet was used during the test.) It is also reported that the Public Security Bureau on Putuo Road has investigated the medicine and found no other abnormalities.</p>

In addition to publishing a statement and sending a letter to the court, we are writing to your newspaper again to request that you make a correction to set things right. We would be most grateful. Sincerely, Tongde Medical College, September 19th.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Open Doubles Tennis: Lin Baohua and Defu Win Championship; Carson Defeats Kolasha in Hard-Fought Singles</h3>
<p>The finals of the Shanghai Open Tennis Doubles and Senior Singles were held yesterday afternoon at the French Chamber of Commerce. Lin Baohua and Defu cooperated perfectly and demonstrated excellent skills. Carson, unable to support himself, was defeated in straight sets. Carson's victory over Kolasha in the singles final was expected. The score was three to one. Details of the match follow:</p>
<p>Doubles Final</p>
<p>At 2:45 PM, Cass started strong, with long shots and short volleys, all executed with ease. Lin Baohua also displayed the demeanor of a famous player, with cross-court backhands often hitting the enemy's weak spots. The two sides were evenly matched, tying at 7-7. Squia repeatedly made unforced errors, and Carson was unable to save him. Lin and Defu took two consecutive games to win the first set 9-7. In the second set, Carson was cautious, and Squia showed renewed spirit. After each side won one game, Carson unleashed his divine power, with sharp and rapid cross-court shots, rendering the enemy helpless. He won two consecutive games. Lin Baohua quickly caught up, tying the score again. Cass won another game, but Lin's luck had arrived. His shots were directed at Squia's side, and Carson was unable to help. Lin and Defu won the second set 6-4 in one fell swoop. In the next set, at 2-2, Lin and Defu emerged as a surprise force, winning two consecutive games. Carson regained two games, but he was already powerless and ended the set 6-4.</p>
<p>Singles Final</p>
<p>Carson, barely recovered, immediately began the singles final against Kolasha. Kolasha was in high spirits and won three consecutive games. After that, Carson gradually calmed down and counterattacked at every opportunity, with precise shots. The two sides exchanged shots, unwilling to give in. At 7-7, Kolasha suddenly panicked, and Carson seized the opportunity to attack, winning the first set. Kolasha reorganized and gradually observed Carson's weaknesses in the second set, placing the ball unpredictably in front, behind, left, and right. Carson's strength gradually waned. Although he won three games, he lost 6-2. After that, although Kolasha fought with all his might, he was ultimately defeated due to inferior skills. Carson won two consecutive sets 6-4. Carson won the Shanghai Open Championship again this year.</p>

<h3>New Autumn Football First Sound: Donghua Defeats Portugal Yesterday; Score 4-1, Halftime 2-1; Long Distance, Few Spectators, Only One Thousand</h3>
<p>The Donghua Football Association, with the Western League approaching, played a friendly match against the strong Western team Portugal at the city sports field yesterday afternoon in order to reorganize its forces. This match was the first sound of the new season, but due to the long distance, the audience was not enthusiastic, totaling only about 1,200 to 1,300 people. As a result, Donghua defeated the Portuguese team 4-1, which shows that although Donghua's lineup is not yet fully stable, its strength is quite sharp. It is expected that when Sun Jia returns from his tour of Europe, the lineup will be even stronger. It is also heard that Donghua has invited the French Chamber of Commerce to play a friendly match at Yiyuan next Saturday (the 26th). The details of yesterday's match are as follows:</p>
<p>Wen Kui Headbutt</p>
<p>When the two sides took to the field, both teams wore white jerseys, so Donghua added a blue vest for identification. After the referee Shen Huichun gave the order, the Portuguese team started the attack, but it was blocked in the middle. Wan Xianghua was as brave as ever and intercepted the ball from the Portuguese team, rushing straight along the side. With a hook, Xu Wenkui caught up and headed the ball into the net, giving Donghua the first goal after only six minutes.</p>
<p>Portuguese Team Shows Its Skills</p>
<p>After several rounds, Donghua's Wenxiu hurriedly attacked the goal but was unsuccessful. Soon after, Remidi lost his footing while saving the ball. The Portuguese left-wing advanced, and Aquino fouled on the baseline. Zhuang Weixin took the free kick, but the kick was not far enough. The ball was obtained by Endaye, who passed it to the center forward. Luo Chai Liao kicked it horizontally and it flew in, losing one city and making it 1-1.</p>
<p>Yi Chen Makes Contribution</p>
<p>At 22 minutes, Dai Linjing again entered alone and headed the ball, but it did not go in. Feng Yunyou received it and shot again, but it was still unsuccessful. Repeatedly good opportunities were lost. In front of the Portuguese goal, there were many Donghua cavalrymen, causing great confusion. Yi Chen broke through from the middle and made a contribution, returning with a goal. Donghua won the first half 2-1.</p>
<p>Penalty Kick</p>
<p>The Portuguese team made major changes to its lineup. One attack was extremely dangerous, but it was safely passed. Soon after, Donghua launched a full-scale counterattack. The three generals Wan, Xu, and Li successively fired fiercely. Goalkeeper Lauren came out to resist the enemy. Because he did not notify the referee when changing positions, he was penalized with a penalty kick. Dai Linjing took the kick and hit the crossbar.</p>
<p>Completing the Great Achievement</p>
<p>After that, Dai's center forward and Portuguese center forward Luo Shi each made a fierce shot, but neither was effective. There were both dangers and ease, but there was no progress. In the last five minutes, Dai Linjing obtained a good opportunity 20 yards from the enemy's goal. He kicked the ball and it went into the net with a sound. The ball was low and fast, and Lauren dived to save it, but it went in under his waist. A few minutes later, when the whistle sounded, Donghua won the final victory 4-1.</p>

<h3>City No. 1 Elementary School Football Match Yesterday</h3>

It is heard that if the two teams have such incidents again in the future, they will be given more severe penalties.</p>

<h3>General Situation of Sports Development in Qingdao: Two New Large Stadiums Built; Various Athlete Teams Organized</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondent: Sports in Qingdao, through the efforts of the municipal authorities and the sincere cooperation of the sports community, is developing rapidly. The newly built First Park Stadium and the stadium at the Huiquan Racecourse have been completed one after another, and the organization of various representative teams in the city is also roughly on track. In the future, the development of Qingdao sports can be expected. The general situation of sports in this city is divided into two items: equipment and work, which are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Sports Equipment: In addition to the large stadium built for the 17th North China Games, two new large stadiums have now been built. One is the Central Third Park Stadium, including fields for track and field, football, basketball, and equipment, specifically for the convenience of citizens who live far from the Huiquan Stadium to engage in sports. The other is a large stadium built in the Huiquan Racecourse, including one football field, small football field, rugby field, hockey field, croquet field, polo field, baseball field, and softball field, two basketball fields and volleyball fields, ten tennis courts, a heavy equipment field, a children's playground, and a track and field field for Chinese and foreign people to use for sports. The above two stadiums have been completed. The Third Park Stadium will be used by Lixian, Chongde, Wende Girls' Middle School, and Shangde Elementary School, which are located near the stadium, to hold joint sports meets in the stadium during this semester in order to commemorate it. The Huiquan Grand Stadium will also be officially opened on a regular basis. The development of sports in this city has always focused on popular development. Now that these two large stadiums have been completed, future progress is not difficult to predict. In addition, there is another project that is currently being planned and implemented, which will build a large swimming pool. Qingdao is located on the coast, and there are seven or eight bathing beaches along the coast. In recent years, due to the efforts to improve the facilities of the bathing beaches, citizens, regardless of men, women, old, or young, are very interested in seawater bathing, which is more popular than other sports. However, although there are many bathing beaches, it is difficult to accurately measure the results of formal competitions, and it is also inconvenient for athlete training. Now, the municipal authorities have decided to plan the construction of a swimming pool in response to the needs of the situation, so as to achieve the goal of completing sports facilities. The equipment of simple sports fields in various districts under the city is also built everywhere, with everything that should be available. With Qingdao being so large and sports facilities being complete, it is feared that it is rarely matched in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>Promotion Work: Qingdao's sports organizations are administratively the Sports Committee of the Education Bureau, and the Sports Promotion Association is for the public. In addition, there is a Sports Field Management Committee. The organizations are generally different, but the work is united and cooperatively divided. For four years, a good foundation has been laid for the promotion of sports in Qingdao. The cooperative spirit of the three committee members is very convenient for promoting work. Recently, in view of the tragic failure of our delegation at the World Games, it was decided to work hard and make Qingdao sports a considerable achievement. The important work is to organize various representative teams under the principle of popularity and sports, and to engage in training. The methods are: (1) In terms of schools, the Sports Committee will submit a request to the Education Bureau to order all secondary schools to first implement the organization of various school teams, with each team limited to ten people. The Sports Committee and the Sports Association will jointly formulate a confrontation program for circular matches in order to select elite city representatives; (2) In terms of amateurs, the Sports Promotion Association will earnestly organize the registration of various sports organizations and individuals in order to select outstanding talents and jointly organize the city representative team. Not only will there be a unified organization for participating in various major conferences in the future, but also when there are external competitions, the Sports Association will draw troops from various school teams or sports organizations to fight. This method can be said to be achieved in one fell swoop and has many benefits. In addition, in order to improve the standards of school sports, the Education Bureau will convene sports teachers from various schools to discuss methods and implement measurement to be used as a reference standard for achievements. In terms of martial arts, it is also actively promoting training centers, certifying martial arts teachers, and storing up teachers. The above are permanent implementation methods. As for temporary sports activities, in addition to various competitions that must be held at the sports field every week, the Chengzhang Cup Tennis Tournament and the compilation of the Qingdao Sports Yearbook have also been held recently.</p>

<h3>Guo Youshou and Others from the Ministry of Education Inspect Education in Gansu; Gansu Province's Education Funding Increases Again This Year; Able to Handle Matters in Accordance with the Instructions of the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>(Lanzhou Airmail) Guo Youshou, Mei Yiqi, Dai Leren, and other experts from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Board of Trustees for Northwest Education took off from Ningxia at 1:15 PM on September 9 and landed in Lanzhou at 3:00 PM. Previously, Li Mengjin and Bai Baojin were assigned by the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund to assist Guo and others in the inspection and had arrived in Lanzhou a few days earlier from Pingjinglonghai Road to Xilan Highway to wait. On the same day, they met with the staff of the Education Department and went to the airport to welcome Guo and others and stayed at the Lizhi Society. On the same day, they visited Chairman Yu and Director Tian to discuss the inspection schedule and began the inspection work the next morning (the 10th). On this day, they visited Gansu College and its affiliated high school and experimental primary school, Gansu Manufacturing Bureau and its affiliated apprentice school, Gansu Provincial Hospital, Gansu Provincial Hygiene Experimental Office, and Provincial Senior Midwifery School. On the 11th, they went to Provincial Lanzhou Middle School, Provincial Lanzhou Normal School and its affiliated primary school, and also visited the Gansu Manufacturing Woolen Mill site and the abandoned large-scale machinery, as well as the Provincial Lanzhou Rural Normal School and the Provincial Lanzhou Agricultural Vocational School. On the 12th, they went to Provincial Industrial Vocational School, Provincial Houfu Street Elementary School, Private Qinghua Elementary School, Qingzhen Temple Half-Day School, Provincial Public Education Center, Provincial Women's Vocational School, Provincial Lanzhou Women's Normal School and its affiliated primary school, and Provincial Library. On the 13th (Sunday), they visited the Northwest Epidemic Prevention Office.

On the 16th, they visited the Agricultural Experimental Field of the Construction Department and the hospital established by the Gansu Inland Mission. The reporter learned that Guo and others originally planned to go to Tianshui, Pingliang, Wuwei, Zhangye, and other places to inspect, but due to inconvenient transportation and time constraints, they conducted more inspections of all schools and educational institutions in Lanzhou. However, of this Northwest inspection, only Qinghai Province has not been visited. The road between Lanzhou and Xining is mostly mountainous and usually feels rugged. Now it is the rainy season, making it even more difficult to travel. They changed their plans and chartered an aircraft from the Eurasia Company. It has now been properly contacted and is scheduled to open a special flight to Xining on the 19th (Saturday) specifically to send the inspection team members to go and pick them up again a week later. It is expected that before Guo and others fly to Qing on the 19th, they plan to spend the 17th and 18th drafting the Sui Ning West Province report and discussing the Gansu Province plan with Director Tian. After that, they will go to Qinghai for a week-long inspection and fly directly to Xi'an on the 26th. At that time, Guo will go to Wugong to inspect the National Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College and then return to Beijing to report to the Ministry of Education. Mei and Dai will return to Yenching University in Beiping to teach, and Li and Bai will continue to conduct inspections in Ningxia and Suiyuan provinces. The reporter asked Guo about his impression of the inspection of Gansu Province. He replied that he was very sorry that he had not been able to inspect the counties outside the provincial capital, but that the various educational facilities in the provincial capital have recently been able to handle matters in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Education. Moreover, Gansu Province's education funding for the 25th year has increased again. Director Tian allocated 70,000 yuan to schools in other counties and hired more than 20 teachers from outside the province for major subjects (more than a dozen have arrived) to serve in secondary schools outside the provincial capital, which is a very good phenomenon.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Implements Preliminary Education Guidance Zone System</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education issued an order to the education bureaus of various counties, stating that in order to improve elementary education in various counties, the department previously established elementary education instructors within the affiliated primary schools of various normal school districts. They were responsible for actively guiding the improvement of primary schools in their respective districts. After years of guidance, gradual progress has been made. However, due to the vastness of the area and the large number of schools, although widespread supervision has been implemented, specialized inspection is still insufficient, hindering the rapid promotion of improvement. As the new year begins, it has been decided to designate 20 to 30 primary schools in each normal school district as elementary education guidance zones, actively guiding their improvement. The achievements of these improvements will serve as models for other schools, and the methods adopted for guidance will serve as examples for inspectors. A nine-article outline of the "Jiangsu Province Trial Implementation of the Elementary Education Guidance Zone System" has been specially formulated. In addition to separate orders, the complete outline is urgently issued for the bureau chief to take note of. Each zone should have two elementary education instructors, one responsible for routine guidance matters, residing in the guidance zone, and the other responsible for general inspection work, allocated by the provincial supervisor of each district. This is for your information. Attached below is the "Jiangsu Province Trial Implementation of the Elementary Education Guidance Zone System" outline:</p>
<p>Outline of the Jiangsu Province Trial Implementation of the Elementary Education Guidance Zone System</p>
<p>Article 1: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education formulates this outline for the trial implementation of the elementary education guidance zone system, to serve as a model for education personnel in various counties. Article 2: The Department of Education designates 20 to 30 primary schools in each normal school district of the province as elementary education guidance zones. Article 3: Each guidance zone should establish a guidance committee composed of the provincial supervisor inspecting the local education in the normal school district, the principal of the district's normal school, the principal of the affiliated primary school, the elementary education instructor, and the local education chief (or section chief), the county supervisor, and one education committee member. The provincial supervisor serves as the chairman. The committee convenes meetings twice each semester to discuss and decide on the main points of guidance and other important matters for each zone. Article 4: The elementary education instructor serving as the guidance committee member in each guidance zone serves as the guide. The guide should reside in the zone and visit each school in the zone at least twice a month, providing active guidance separately and assessing the results of their improvement. A guidance meeting should be held once a month to guide and jointly discuss improvement methods. When necessary, demonstration teaching, reciprocal observation and critique, and exhibition competitions should be held to facilitate mutual learning. Article 5: Each school in the guidance zone should accept the guidance of the guide and strive for improvement. If anyone fails to follow the guidance, the guide may correct it at any time or consult with the provincial supervisor for handling. Article 6: Existing inspectors in the locality of the guidance zone should be guided by the guide when inspecting the zone. Any administrative sanctions should be agreed upon with the guide. Article 7: The guide should submit diagnostic inspections, guidance plans, and progress reports to the provincial supervisor periodically, who will then submit them to the Department of Education for review and selective publication, for reference by education administrative personnel and primary school teachers in various counties. Article 8: The operating expenses of each guidance zone are paid from the business expenses of the affiliated primary school in each normal school district. Article 9: This method is promulgated and implemented by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education.</p>

<h3>Overview of Japanese Schools in Shanghai (I)</h3>
<p>— Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>Japanese residents in Shanghai have established four Japanese primary schools and three middle schools in Shanghai, with a total of 3,767 students. This article will provide a brief introduction to the various facilities of Japanese primary and middle schools. The author is grateful to Mr. Kanno Masaburo, the head of the Japanese Residents' Group, and Mr. Hosoki Nobuo, the secretary, for providing various materials. I would also like to thank Mr. Ishizawa, the principal of the Middle Japanese Normal Primary School, and Mr. Mizuguchi Minjiro, the principal of the Japanese Girls' High School, for giving me a picture of each school building. I also thank my colleague Mr. Chu Yingrui for determining the transliteration of names.</p>
<p>1. History of School Establishment</p>
<p>Japanese residents have been running schools in Shanghai for 51 years. In 1885, a monk belonging to the Higashi Honganji Temple independently founded a Japanese school to educate Japanese children in Shanghai. This school is the origin of the current Japanese primary school; at that time, less than 20 children were enrolled, and the curriculum in the school was limited to reading, arithmetic, and writing.</p>
<p>In 1900, the school was changed to public and renamed Kaido Primary School; the number of students increased to about 50. Five years later, the school was taken over by a community organized by Japanese residents. In 1907, the Shanghai Japanese Residents' Group was officially established, and the group accepted the responsibility of running Japanese schools; at this time, the number of students had increased to about 200.</p>
<p>In recent years, the number of Japanese residents in Shanghai has gradually increased; Japanese schools have also been added accordingly. New schools have been established in the east, west, and central districts of the city. There are now a total of seven Japanese schools with a total of 3,767 students. These schools are all managed by the Shanghai Japanese Residents' Group and supervised by the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai. The names, addresses, and establishment dates of the Japanese schools are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Survey Table of Names, Addresses, and Establishment Dates of Japanese Schools in Shanghai</p>
<p>Japanese residents in various places in Shanghai send their children to Japanese schools, so the number of students in each school is very large. The statistics of the number of male and female students in each school are recorded below:</p>
<p>Statistics Table of the Number of Male and Female Students in Japanese Schools in Shanghai (Statistics for 1935)</p>
<p>Note: Among the number of students in the above schools, there are two Chinese female students and one male student.</p>

<h3>Securities: The Government Bond Market Was Quiet as Usual, Each Bond Was Only Slightly Down by 0.15 to 0.3</h3>

<h3>North-South Goods: Raw Sun-Dried Meat Market Fluctuates Slightly</h3>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<h3>Yarn Flower Speculation, Stagnant Outlet for Arbitrage Yarn, Weak Trend in Marked Yarn, Especially Severe Decline in Current Month</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending downwards, with a weak outlook. This is due to the lackluster performance of overseas yarn and cotton. With the September settlement period approaching, there are several thousand bales of arbitrage yarn. This cotton yarn is particularly sluggish, unwelcome, and the unfavorable environment has pushed market prices lower.</p>
<p>Slack Market in Marked Yarn</p>
<p>The opening of the marked yarn market showed a uniform decline across all months. News of a clash between Japanese and Chinese troops in Fengtai has caused panic, leading to a lack of buying interest and a step-by-step decline in the market, showing a slack trend. According to some, there are still several thousand bales of old arbitrage chips in the current month. This cotton yarn is sluggish and unwelcome, causing the market to worsen. Changfeng, Run Kang, Yong Da, Xie Cheng, Rui Da, and others sold slightly, while Geng Feng, Yi Chang, Tai Chang, and Fu Kang slightly increased their long positions. Both long and short positions saw minimal activity. As a result, all months fell by one, two, and three jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening saw a significant drop in the current month's market, due to a lack of buyers, and a two yuan drop in near-month third-grade yarn. However, the far months were tighter, with the second and third sessions remaining weak. As a result, the current month fell by six jiao compared to the morning closing price, and the far months rose by two and a half jiao. Sales included 1,150 bales from Da Feng, 850 bales from Rui Da, 800 bales from Sen Kang, 2,900 bales from Changfeng, 2,450 bales from Run Kang, 800 bales from Xie Cheng, 800 bales from Yong Da, and 850 bales from Wang Tai Yu. Purchases included 650 bales from Yu Da, 600 bales from Ji Feng, 700 bales from Tai Yu, 1,350 bales from Geng Feng, 800 bales from Tai Chang, 1,400 bales from Yi Chang, 1,300 bales from Xin Cheng, 600 bales from Shun Ji, and 600 bales from Sheng Yuan. The day's high and low prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Yarn    Highest Price   Lowest Price    Closing Price   Compared to Previous Day    Inventory</p>
<p>September   201.8   200.6   200.6   Down 1.90   52,650</p>

<p>44,500</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Prices Stable</p>
<p>Spot yarn consumption is still good. A total of 1,012 bales were purchased by various groups throughout the day, with prices remaining stable. The purchase amounts by each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Shantou  50  Guangdong 205 Tianjin 140 Xuzhou 50</p>
<p>Mainland China    435 Fellow Traders    85  Nanjing 17 Changsha 40</p>
<h3>Hope for Bumper Crop of New Cotton, Resurgence of Falling Cotton Prices</h3>
<p>The cotton market is experiencing a resurgence of falling prices, with a mediocre market sentiment. The US cotton market is lackluster, and with clear weather, there is hope for a plentiful supply of new cotton from various sources. Ningbo merchants have resumed speculative selling, and Changhe is also selling, causing a sudden relaxation in the market. However, some cotton merchants are optimistic and are buying in. In general, this year's harvest is bountiful, and there are sellers eager to unload when prices rise.</p>
<p>Sudden Large-Scale Speculative Selling by Ningbo Merchants</p>
<p>The marked cotton market opened with fluctuations of one pound sterling for US cotton, a rise of one rupee for Indian cotton, and a fall of two jiao and three fen for Osaka second-grade cotton. The local weather is clear, and the new cotton is gradually flooding the market. Ningbo merchants have suddenly engaged in large-scale speculative selling, with a substantial volume, putting pressure on the market. The market is declining step by step, with Yuan Yu Chang and Changfeng Fu Kang showing strong selling intentions. However, Da Fu, Da Feng, Yuan Da, Jin Chang, Wang Tai Yu, Da Chang, Xin Cheng, and others are covering short positions and increasing their long positions simultaneously. As a result, all months fell by two, three, four, and five jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening saw some covering, with a slight rebound of one jiao to one and a half jiao. However, after one session, it was reported that 11,000 bales of Yao cotton would arrive tomorrow, and the factory's appetite was not as strong as the previous day, causing the market sentiment to weaken again. As a result, all months rose or fell by nine fen compared to the morning closing price. Sales included 2,800 dan from Shen Ji, 1,500 dan from Da Fu, 4,600 dan from Heng Feng, 1,000 dan from Xing Chang, 1,600 dan from Hua Feng, 1,700 dan from Wang Tai Xing, 4,000 dan from Chang Yu, 5,600 dan from Run Kang, 1,200 dan from Jing Hua, 1,900 dan from Jin Kang, 1,600 dan from Yuan Xing Chang, 3,000 dan from Hua Kang, 1,200 dan from Da Chang, 7,300 dan from Chang He, and 2,700 dan from Ming Hua. Purchases included 1,800 dan from Ji Feng, 1,200 dan from Da Feng, 2,200 dan from Yuan Da, 3,200 dan from Geng Feng, 3,900 dan from Tai Chang, 6,200 dan from Xin Cheng, 2,300 dan from He Xing, and 4,200 dan from Shen Chang. The day's high and low prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Cotton   Highest Price Closing Price   Compared to Previous Day    Inventory</p>
<p>October  28.60  28.25  28.25  Down 0.50 206,300</p>
<p>November 39.15  28.90  38.90  Down 0.55 390,200</p>

<p>February 40.15  40.00  10.05  Down 0.25 203,100</p>
<p>Total 708,600</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Demand Lower Than Before</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is mediocre, with factory demand lower than the previous day. The source is 4,850 bales of Yao cotton, with an asking price of 34 yuan and 6 jiao, down 2 jiao from yesterday. Common cotton is 890 bales, with an asking price of 45 yuan.</p>

<h3>US Cotton Region Unaffected by Hurricane</h3>
<p>The cotton market opened with positive news from Liverpool. Traders in Liverpool and the Far East were buying, pushing prices up by four to five pound sterling across all months. The western cotton region continued to experience rain, while local traders and New Orleans were selling. Southern speculative selling increased, causing market prices to soften. Spot cotton prices remained firm, with active demand. Hester estimated this week's factory usage at 204,000 bales, and Liverpool's inventory at 230,000 bales. It was reported that the eastern cotton region was unaffected by the hurricane. The closing was stable, with spot prices unchanged and futures falling by one pound sterling to rising by two pound sterling. British spot cotton rose by two points, and futures rose by one point. Indian cotton initially rose due to buying by futures traders and speculators, but later fell due to selling by spot traders. Ping Guo Er rose by 1.25 rupees, and Aomu La and Bai Luo Xi rose by one rupee. The original telegram is listed below (dated 18th):</p>

<h3>Grain, Sluggish Trading in Flour Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market was quiet and peaceful throughout the day. After the morning session, news of overseas wheat reported that Chicago wheat was down a little, Canadian wheat down five jiao, and Liverpool wheat down one and a half pence. Overseas markets showed mixed fluctuations with no major trend. Initially, factories slightly bought back near-month contracts and covered floating short positions, making the market slightly stable. However, as yarn and cotton prices fell, market sentiment was slightly affected, and both near and far-month contracts saw dispersed selling. The afternoon session showed weakness, but trading was sluggish with no intense competition, fluctuating only by around half a fen. In total, the day's results showed September 12 unchanged, November up half a fen, January up seven and a half li, and October and February each up two and a half li.</p>

<h3>Wheat Market Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw overseas wheat prices fluctuating after the morning opening, with both buying and selling interest being weak. Near and far-month prices fluctuated by only one or two fen. However, when the flour market rebounded in the afternoon, buying interest weakened, and both near and far-month contracts fell by two or three fen. However, selling pressure was not strong, so weakness was not pronounced, and the situation remained peaceful. Compared to the previous day's closing price, September was down one fen, October and February were down three fen each, December was down two fen, and November and January were down four fen each. The spot wheat market was stable, with Shandong Yingzhou Shaheji Zhangbaling wheat ranging from 5.08 yuan to 5.04 yuan. Zhengyangguan wheat was 5 yuan, and Anqing wheat was 4.8 jiao. A total of 3,000 bales were purchased in the morning session, with Shen Da purchasing 800 bales.</p>

<h3>River Rice Outlets Still Good</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various gangs were even scarcer, with only shipments from around the 10th, totaling nearly 2,000 shi. Therefore, the market for new sharp-pointed rice was even more brisk, with prices increasing by a fraction of an inch. New Yangjian rice also increased slightly. New Japonica rice increased slightly, but thick early japonica rice remained stable due to flat retail sales. Thin rice, handled by the Qingdao gang at over 400 packages, saw no ups or downs in price, remaining roughly the same.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, various goods from He Xia arrived around the 30th. Sales of various types in the market were still active. High-quality broken japonica rice prices were flat, while medium and lower-quality rice increased by a few fen to about one jiao. Old Yangjian rice was scarce and stable, while new Yangjian rice was slightly tight. The price of new port group customer rice increased by about one jiao. The price of new western japonica rice was tight, while new eastern japonica rice saw little rise or fall.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<h3>Guangdong Sales of Guest Rice Very Brisk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, guest indica rice arrivals and sales were both brisk, and the market atmosphere was very good. New arrivals in the past two days totaled about 10,000 bags. However, sales in Guangdong were very active, and some were directly transported for sale, so the market was not significantly affected by the surge in new arrivals. The new arrivals in the past few days were mainly machine-milled rice, while there were fewer arrivals of brown rice, which was suitable for the Guangdong gang's brisk handling. The price rose sharply by six or seven fen to over one jiao. Other machine-milled rice prices were generally flat. The total market opening included 4,510 bags of Hunan rice, 5,110 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,100 bags of brown rice from Hankou and Shashi, and 85 bags of Taiwan indica rice, which were distributed by various gangs from Guangdong, Shantou, Ningbo, Xiamen, and local areas.</p>
<h3>Foreign Bank Sesame Arrivals in Succession</h3>
<p>Foreign bank sesame prices were previously 12 yuan, reportedly up to 11 yuan and 9 jiao, with 600 deals. Yesterday, the market first traded at 11 yuan and 9 jiao, then 11 yuan and 9 jiao and a half fen, with 300 tons traded. The market tightened later due to continued buying, but no deals were opened. The future direction is still uncertain, and prices largely follow the market's fluctuations. Because new sources from various places are continuously arriving, market sentiment is little excited by foreign bank sales. The Dongyang gang handled over 1,000 bags from Shashi, the Quanzhou gang handled 105 bags of Haozhou sesame, and the rest were small, scattered amounts. Yamamoto Street and others handled over 400 bags.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Silk Sales Both Domestic and Foreign Subside Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silk markets fell slightly again (New York recent contracts down 1 fen, far contracts down 1.5 fen, Yokohama spot and futures contracts each down 8 yuan). This led to a renewed lull in Shanghai silk markets, except for continued sales by Xinfu Lianna. Users of silk, hearing that this autumn's cocoon crop will only be 70% of normal, most silk merchants are maintaining a bullish price outlook and are unwilling to sell. The domestic sales situation is therefore also stagnant. In the evening, Yokohama far-month contracts rebounded and silk trading on the New York Stock Exchange was not quiet (volume was 1,060 bales), so next week's silk market seems likely to gradually stabilize or possibly rally.</p>
<h3>Possibility of Full Sale of Red Tea</h3>
<p>Since the Anhui-Jiangxi Red Tea Sales Office proposed a plan to completely sell the 7,000+ remaining cases of red tea on the market, foreign firms such as Xiehe, Yihua, and Jixiang, as well as Wang Yutai Tea Shop, have paid close attention. Overall, Wang Yutai's ability to sell and adapt makes their buying power stronger. It is heard that tea merchants from Qifu to  will convene a meeting today to discuss countermeasures and a decision may be made within days.</p>
<h3>Green Tea Market Quiet This Week</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Tea House Association, the green tea market has been quiet this week. Sales have been brisk since the beginning of the season due to stable prices, so exports are more than double those of the same period last year. In recent weeks, arrivals of tea have been scarce, and inventories are low. Most of the high-quality tea has already been sold, causing foreign orders to question the prices of the remaining tea, and buyers need to consider this. Therefore, the market is temporarily quiet, with only scattered transactions. This week, Baotou Hangjin made the most purchases, totaling 1,030 boxes. Other purchases included only 280 boxes of Chouzhen and 370 boxes of Xiaozhenmei. Pingshui tea, large lots and other types of tea have also been out of the market for a long time. Discussions are underway with foreign firms, and it is hoped that activity will increase next week.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Sales of Western-Style Lining Fabric Also Brisk</h3>
<p>With autumn sales in full swing for woollen fabrics, accessories for Western-style clothing, such as sleeve linings and Western-style lining fabrics, are being purchased in large quantities by Western-style clothing stores in this street. Prices are also firm. The trend for printed Western-style fabrics and mabu sleeve linings is particularly good. The original cloth of printed striped Western-style fabrics produced by Guohua and sold by Jinyuan is selling for 5 jiao 5 fen per full piece. Hongsheng woven striped Western-style fabrics are selling for 5 jiao 3 fen. The mabu sleeve linings produced by Qinhua and sold by Dachangyu are selling for 5 jiao 5 fen per yard of the original cloth. Daohua first-class is 7 jiao, second-class is 6 jiao. Black carbon lining and Jiangshan lining, as well as Faxi lining, are also selling well. Yesterday, Aier 277 Western-style goods were all priced at 6 jiao and 5 fen, Dongfang goods at 4 jiao and 2 fen, Renyu at 4 jiao, and Guohua Hongsheng at 3 jiao and 9 fen. Hongsheng first-class black carbon lining is selling for 1 yuan and 4 jiao, second-class is 1 yuan and 2 jiao and a half. Ningbo Jiangshan 9-inch horsehair lining is 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market, Refined Green and Sliced Green Both Rise Continuously</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market showed a firm trend with little change. The association's price list showed that spot second-grade coarse sugar white and re-exported goods were all priced at the original price. Dongbai only saw a 5-fen rise in the price of No. 8 re-exported goods, to 6 yuan and 2 jiao, with the rest as before. Local cotton white was held at the original price. There were Chaozhou gang openings on the numbered plate, with Zuihe Ti Ning 51 at 15 yuan, an increase of 4.5 jiao. There were no continued openings for high-quality cotton red. Sixty more packages of second-grade Zhuang were sold, with lower-quality goods. Furthermore, the Guangxi gang opened 104 boxes of Beihai sliced green at 10 yuan and 2 jiao, an increase of one jiao.</p>
<h3>Upon Whose Shoulders Does the Future Glory Rest?</h3>
<p>— Zhai Fu</p>
<p>The "September 18th" National Humiliation Memorial has been forgotten again!</p>
<p>We should deeply reflect: National humiliation is not created overnight; nor can it be washed away in a single day. Just look at people's bodies. A weak body doesn't become weak in a day or two. A strong body isn't built in a day or two either.</p>
<p>The nation's weakness is not the fault of one or two people; it is the cumulative fault of the entire nation over a hundred years. To wash away national humiliation cannot be accomplished by the power of one or two people now or in the future. It requires the joint struggle of the entire nation for ten, twenty, even a hundred years, from now until the future, to be effective.</p>
<p>Consider our representatives who returned from the World Games with a "zero score." We consider this a great regret in national honor. But this regret is not because our athletes were unwilling to work hard at the Olympics. It is fundamentally due to the fact that our "physical strength is inferior to others!" Therefore, in various competitions, we can often compete at the beginning, but then we fail.</p>
<p>Someone said, "To win glory in future World Games, we must start by cultivating the physical fitness of the people: it will take at least fifteen years to see results." Therefore, the future national honor rests on the shoulders of the children of today. If students in elementary schools today are well-trained physically, they will certainly not return with a "zero score" from the World Games fifteen years later.</p>
<p>It is not only sports that are like this. Our country needs talents in many fields. In addition to everyone needing to train their bodies, children must also diligently hone themselves in any area they are naturally drawn to!</p>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>— Wan Wen</p>
<p>In life, whether adult or child, male or female, for every day we live, there is work to be done. No matter the size of the task, preparation is necessary before it can be carried out.</p>
<p>Many small but beneficial things in the world are overlooked and forgotten, which is very regrettable. If they could be utilized, much benefit could be gained. Children! You might as well try preparing and see if I am right.</p>
<p>First, let me compare the results of preparation and non-preparation. Take exams at school, for example. If you review your books before the exam in preparation, you won't feel difficulty during the exam because it's all familiar material. Even if you don't know one or two questions, it doesn't matter. When the scores are announced, your grades will definitely be excellent, or at least your ranking won't be too low. If you don't review your books before the exam in preparation and rely only on what you've heard and seen on weekdays, your mind will not be able to remember many questions. During the exam, you will definitely feel difficulty, and cheating will occur. If you are caught by the teacher, not only will your grades be poor, but you will also lose your integrity. Children probably have this experience. I hope you will act in a good way, which is to prepare beforehand.</p>
<p>However, preparation cannot be perfunctory in a short time. You must prepare fully until you are completely proficient. Only such preparation can achieve great results, which cannot be compared to the results of short-term preparation.</p>
<p>Children! What are you preparing for? Your current studies are preparing you to shoulder the important responsibilities of the country in the future. As your age increases, your responsibilities become greater, and preparation becomes more important. Those who study medicine prepare to serve in the medical field; those who study teacher training prepare to serve in the educational field; those who study aviation prepare to strengthen the country's defense. Know that the foundation of preparation is laid in your childhood.</p>
<h3>Small Game</h3>
<p>— Lu Changfan</p>
<p>Children, do you have galvanized iron downspouts under your eaves? If you do, when the downspout is slightly broken (make sure it's not too broken), you can use it to make a very interesting toy.</p>
<p>The shape of this thing must be like the one in the first picture. After making it into this shape, place a mirror at point A in the first picture, and another mirror at point B. The two mirrors should face each other. After placing the two mirrors, use something like a cigarette can lid, cut a round hole in the middle, and install it at point C. Close one of your eyes and look into the tube, and you will see many scenes outside the tube.</p>
<h3>National Hero Zu Ti</h3>
<p>— Zeng</p>
<p>Zu Ti was a person of the Jin Dynasty. From childhood, he had great ambitions and had an excellent relationship with his friend Liu Kun. They often slept in the same bed. One night, Zu Ti woke up in the middle of the night. In a haze, he suddenly heard the sound of a rooster crowing. It crowed loudly again and again. He quickly woke Liu Kun and said, "It's almost dawn. Listen, how impassioned the rooster's crow is!" After Liu Kun heard him, he hurriedly got up, and the two of them took down the precious swords on the wall and danced together for a while.</p>
<p>Soon after, the Five Barbarians caused chaos in China, and the Jin Dynasty moved south. The northern part of our country was all under the influence of the barbarian forces. Fortunately, Zu Ti led a large army to attack north. When he crossed the river, he struck the oar, pointed at the river water, and swore in a very tragic way: "If Zu Ti cannot pacify the Central Plains, I will never cross this river again." His will was very firm. Later, he defeated the barbarians and made them flee in defeat, and the area south of the Yellow River was completely recovered.</p>
<p>Children: Work hard! I hope that you will become national heroes like Zu Ti and clean up the current mess in our country!</p>

<h3>Why Does the Body Feel Cold After Bathing?</h3>
<p>— He Zixiang</p>
<p>Children: When the weather is hot or you are working hard, the sweat glands on our body secrete a kind of liquid, which is sweat. After sweating, you should bathe; otherwise, it will have a bad influence on your body.</p>
<p>Children! When you come out of the bath, you must have the feeling and question, "Why does my body feel cold?"</p>
<p>When you come out of the bath, there are water droplets attached to your body. The water droplets absorb heat and vaporize, which takes heat from our bodies; so our bodies feel cold after bathing.</p>
<p>Why is it easier to swim when you inhale more air?</p>
<p>Children: Have you learned to swim during the summer vacation? Swimming is a very good exercise that develops physical fitness, increases lung capacity, and has the effect of emergency rescue, so it is necessary and valuable to learn.</p>
<p>Anyone who can swim has this concept: "When swimming, inhaling a large amount of air saves effort." Why does it save effort? Children! I will tell you:</p>
<p>When we inhale a large amount of air while swimming, the lungs expand, and the volume of the whole body also increases, so the buoyancy is greater. And the weight of the inhaled air is very small: so it feels easier when swimming.</p>
<p>Children! When you learn to swim, you can prove that this is true.</p>
<h3>Love the Zoo Carp in the Lotus Pond</h3>
<p>— Dong Xun</p>
<p>The water lilies in the pond are blooming!</p>
<p>White flowers,</p>
<p>Green round leaves,</p>
<p>How beautiful!</p>
<p>And those carp,</p>
<p>Green, black, red, orange;</p>
<p>Swimming around,</p>
<p>Are the masters of the lotus pond!</p>
<p>Younger brother and sister came to the lotus pond,</p>
<p>The fish float to the surface to welcome them,</p>
<p>They throw bran cakes into the water,</p>
<p>Let them dance and chase after them,</p>
<p>Opening their mouths to swallow with a "zhe bo, zhe bo" sound,</p>
<p>The cakes get wet and gradually soften and sink,</p>
<p>The carp follow the cakes and dive to the bottom of the water,</p>
<p>But when the cakes are thrown again, they float to the surface again.</p>
<p>The younger sister said:</p>
<p>"Cake after cake is thrown, one after another is tossed,</p>
<p>Fish, fish, you must be careful!</p>
<p>Fortunately, we are not fishermen,</p>
<p>Otherwise, we would have fished you into the basket early and taken you home to cook!"</p>
<p>The fish swim as if to say:</p>
<p>"The people in the world are all bad-hearted,</p>
<p>Only younger brother and sister are good people,</p>
<p>We only eat your small bran cakes,</p>
<p>We don't taste other people's hooked cakes!"</p>
<h3>What Does the Northeast Four Provinces Have?</h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>The tragic "September 18th" Memorial Day has passed in an instant. This year is the fifth anniversary. But in your sorrow, have you ever thought about why Japan wants to seize it? It is because the Northeast Four Provinces are rich in products and are the lifeline of our country. So, "What does the Northeast Four Provinces have?" Here I will briefly write some of them below:</p>
<p>What are the four provinces of the Northeast? Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe. Among the four provinces, Heilongjiang has the largest area, and Rehe has the smallest. Liaoning Province has an area of 850,000 square miles, and about 13.34 million residents. The Han ethnic group is the largest, followed by the Manchu and Mongolian ethnic groups. Jilin Province has an area of 880,000 square miles, and less than 6 million residents. Heilongjiang Province has an area of 1,780,000 square miles, and a population of only 5 million. Rehe Province has an area of 580,000 square miles, and a population of about 3.83 million. As Mr. Dong Xun said in this publication, Japan's area is only 152,300 square miles, but the area of the Four Eastern Provinces is 4,090,000 square miles. Comparing the two, the difference is truly vast.</p>
<p>(1) Liaoning Benxi produces smokeless coal, with an annual output of more than 300,000 tons. Yantai produces smokeless coal, with only a few hundred tons per day. The Fushun mining area extends for five miles and produces more than 11,000 tons per year, all operated by the Benxi Lake Coal and Iron Company. Other gold, silver, talc, and asbestos are also produced. Changbai Mountain is rich in forests, and ginseng is a special product. The Liao River coast produces beans and sorghum, and the coast has the benefit of fish and salt; wild silkworms are produced in the area from Xiuyan to Kuandian.</p>
<p>(2) Jilin Yilan, Ning'an, Mishan, Muling, Dongning, Wangqing, Yanji, Huichun, Hudian, and Panshi are famous gold-producing areas. There are many forests and abundant fur production. Sable fur, ginseng, and Ula grass are the three treasures of Jilin. There is a lot of sorghum, beans, and wheat. Mishan produces a large amount of honey, and Northeast Wang Lake is rich in salt.</p>
<p>(3) Heilongjiang There are four gold mines in Shiwei, and eight gold mines in Qihe. The total gold mining area in Zhongxinggou Hanhe Yu mining area is about 70 li from east to west and 40 li from north to south. The mining bureau is located in Hanhe Laogou. Huma, Yuqinggou, 120 li southeast, has seven locations; North, east, and west are more than 300 li, north and south are more than 100 li, all producing gold, with ten locations, the general bureau is in Taipinggou. The Heihe gold mine has an annual output value of more than 11.1 million yuan. The province's coal mine produces 160 million tons annually. Taking Zhalainuoer as an example, the annual output is more than 200 million catties. The Daxing'anling forest area is 3,000 square li, the Yilehuli forest is 8,000 square li, the Dongxing'anling forest is 6,000 square li, and the Balan area. Bean production is the largest, followed by wheat. The west has the benefits of salt and livestock.</p>
<p>(4) Rehe Mountain gold and placer gold are produced in Chengde, Weichang, Pingquan, Luanping and other counties. Asbestos is produced in Chaoyang and Lingyuan. The province's coal reserves total 930 million tons. Mining is done by the Beipiao Coal Mine Company. Iron is also very rich.</p>
<p>Dear children! After reading about the rich resources of the above four provinces, I hope that you will go and recover them in the future, so as not to let down the purpose of my writing this article.</p>

<h3>Watching the "Little Men" Children's Educational Film</h3>
<p>— Lin, a sixth-grade student at Jingqin Elementary School</p>
<p>One Sunday afternoon, the weather was clear and bright. Brother Jing led my younger sister Liu Bao and me to the Cathay Grand Theatre to watch a movie.</p>
<p>The movie showing at Cathay that day was "Little Men." Children who love to read this newspaper have already read about it in the education news section of this newspaper. This collection of children's novels is quite famous in the American literary world. Therefore, "Little Men" was jointly starred by thirteen child stars from Hollywood on the silver screen, breaking the unprecedented record in the United States. It was truly a lively and vivid performance.</p>
<p>"Little Men is the most moving story, the most profound description, and the most innocent performance." This sentence is correct. To give a few examples, Natty's introduction to school, the surprise to the point of gratitude, this scene, in the pure emotions of us naive and innocent children, is so fitting! Later, their playing in the circus and the scene of smoking caused the children to fight each other, which also allowed us to transition from a joyful situation to a tragic and tense one. Another scene is when Donn gets money for his friend, puts it in place, and is reprimanded. This is very touching to our heated climax, until Donn runs away, Dickson gets sick and dies, and the burial scene, in particular, make people feel extremely sad.</p>
<p>The story ends like this. In short, "Little Men," this book, "Little Men," this film, is the world of our elementary school students. I hope that all dear children will quickly become familiar with this "Little Men" published in this newspaper, because the content is rich and has great significance in guiding us to good.</p>

<h3>Secrets of Camping Answering Miss Zhou Guilian from Beiping</h3>
<p>We have thought carefully about what happened to you at the Wo Fo Si (reclining buddha temple) summer camp, and it is entirely because you are not a Girl Scout that you made so many jokes. Now we will tell you.</p>
<p>You said, "Every night the camp gate was not closed tightly, and there was a large gap, and many mosquitoes and gnats came in, biting more than forty wounds on my arm." That is entirely your own fault. Why didn't you buckle the camp gate before staking the tent? Because you staked the tent too far away, the camp gate will naturally have a gap. Has your wound not healed yet? This is again your own fault for not bringing a small first aid kit when camping. Knowing that gnats and mosquitoes in summer are annoying, even at home, ammonia smelling alcohol must be prepared!</p>
<p>Originally, when camping, unless absolutely necessary, do not set up camp in the woods, because even when the weather is sunny, raindrops on the leaves will drip onto the camp, as if it is still raining. Probably your friend did not lie to you, it only rained for half the night, but you thought it rained all night, just because your camp was in the forest, not because there was something wrong with your nerves.</p>
<p>The dew will wet your quilt? We don't quite believe it. We have camped for who knows how many times over the past ten years, and sometimes the camps we used are not as thick as the canvas you used, but we have never been wet with the quilt on our bodies, even in the rain. Let me ask you first, (1) is the tent supported tightly? Is it wrinkled at all? Otherwise, the water will accumulate in the wrinkles or unsupported areas and seep in, and the result will be leakage. (2) Did you firmly remember? Don't let your head, fingers, or anything touch the tent cloth? If you did, it is no wonder that the dew will wet your quilt. Because you touched the tent cloth, the fuzz or fine—fibers—of the cloth were smoothed out, so the water droplets accumulated outside the tent would seep in along the source, and naturally it would leak.</p>
<p>Due to time and space constraints, I cannot fully talk to you here. Soon we will send you another letter directly to discuss the small issues you mentioned.</p>
<p>We of course welcome you to be our friends. Wishing you good health! Respectfully answered by the Chinese Boy Scout Self-Help Society</p>
<p>Call for Articles</p>
<p>This publication's Double Tenth Festival Special Issue is seeking materials such as common sense, poems, jokes, stories, and children's free writings, etc., that are lively and interesting. Each article is limited to a maximum of 400 words. The deadline for submissions is October 4th.</p>
<h3>The Seven Sisters in the Mountains (1)</h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>In the Westmorland Mountains of England, there is a small and narrow mountain gorge. It is called the Blandthorn Gorge. At its foot lies a green and lovely valley and a Grasmere Lake. The water in the mountain stream flows continuously, flowing from the northern valley area to the lake. In the north, there is also a beautiful valley called Easedale, surrounded by high mountains, covered with green grass. Because there are often groups of sheep grazing there, the grass is soft and smooth, just like the lawn in someone's garden, and in early spring, the grass has grown neatly, as if it is covered with a green velvet carpet, which is unmatched by the hillsides elsewhere. At one end of Easedale, there is a small village called Grasmere Village. At the other end, a sloping high slope leads directly to a small mountain gorge surrounded by high mountains. There is no way out on all sides, only a rugged and uneven low slope that can lead to Easedale. There is also a winding and very dangerous path that passes through the mountains for six miles and reaches the top of Lanthwaite Hill. This lonely mountain gorge is called Far Easedale. A small house stands on the gorge, which is called Blandthorn. There is a crack in the mountain stone above the house, and there is a pool of water outside. There must have been water before, but it has long since dried up.</p>
<p>Living in this small house was an honest old soldier named George Green. He opened up a small farm in the mountains and married a lively and hardworking woman to be his wife. She was good at managing the house and kept the small family in good order. When the weather was clear and the mountain roads were easy to walk, she always dressed her children neatly and sent them to school.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1807, many pieces of furniture were being auctioned off at an estate on Lanthwaite Hill. The residents of the mountains regarded auctions as major events. People from all over the mountains often came from afar and treated each other very politely, using this as an opportunity to do various kinds of business, and old friends who had not seen each other for a long time could also meet and chat. George Green and his wife, Shan Lan, were no exception. They set off early in the morning on this sunny winter day to participate in the auction, leaving their mountain house and six young children to the care of their eldest daughter, Angeni. However, she was only nine years old and could not take care of much. Their family did not employ servants or tenants in the house and fields, and there were no neighbors nearby, so they had to place the heavy responsibility of the family on the shoulders of the nine-year-old girl.</p>
<p>Little Angeni was also a very stable and meticulous child. The day passed peacefully without any unexpected events, but as evening approached, a thick fog covered the mountains, and the air suddenly became suffocating. It was clearly a sign that a major storm was coming. The children earnestly watched for their parents to return, but that day the thick fog blocked their vision, and flakes of snow began to fall. The sky was already dark.</p>

<h3>How to Deal with "Chi Jiang Cha"?</h3>
<p>— Xin Guifang</p>
<p>"Chi Jiang Cha" (吃講茶, literally "eat speaking tea") is a slang term, and by "slang," it's like the "old friends" of heroes in the old books, a popular term commonly used in the underworld. In Shanghai a few years ago, if you encountered a matter involving the "old friends" and had a small dispute that couldn't be resolved immediately, you would inevitably be taken to a place to "Chi Jiang Cha." This implied "speaking" to settle the matter, with "tea" serving as a gesture of respect to the guest. The original intention wasn't bad; it was actually an extremely peaceful means to turn big problems into small ones, and small problems into non-problems. At the appointed place (usually a tea house frequented by the "old friends," such as Yile Tian, Risheng Lou, Qinglian Ge in the city, or the "Sihai Shengping Tea House" commonly seen on North-South Shanghai Street), everyone would sit down, with covered teacups and teapots set out. After a brief greeting, they would drink tea and discuss the matter reasonably. However, times have changed. In the past, there was little shouting or cursing, and no one would jump around wildly. But recently, there has been a lack of restraint, and the so-called disputes often involve "chai shao" (拆梢, extorting) or "qiao zhu gang" (敲竹槓, blackmailing) – actions that make people feel sorry for the "old friends." As a result, both the municipal government and the special zone authorities have put up signs in tea houses "prohibiting Jiang Cha."</p>
<p>Currently, "Chi Jiang Cha" still happens frequently. However, some occur in hotels or restaurants; more modern ones even gather during tea dance time at small dance halls. Because they fear violating the law, they are very cautious. Even if outsiders walk by, they often can't tell that "Chi Jiang Cha" is taking place. They only see people whispering and discussing things privately.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, "Chi Jiang Cha" originally aimed to resolve disputes. Therefore, merely participating in "Chi Jiang Cha" isn't considered a serious matter, and it certainly shouldn't lead to a life-or-death struggle like enemies fighting. Thus, dealing with "Chi Jiang Cha" isn't difficult. Even if you are being "chai shao" (extorted), it's not a big deal. Sometimes, the "old friends" or loafers might misunderstand, or they might be "borrowing your reputation" by "kan xiang" (看相, sizing up) you, calling you a "yang pan" (洋盤, dupe), which in the underworld refers to someone not in the underworld, not "in the know," also called "kong zi" (空子, sucker), meaning they are not members of the Green or Red Gangs. But their established rules can restrain them and make them know when to stop (i.e., "shi xiang" 識相, knowing what's what). "Borrowing your reputation" simply means a free meal or drink, commonly called "la tai zi" (拉檯子, setting up the table), or "bang chen" (帮襯, helping out), which means asking for your assistance, asking you to spend some money, and everyone makes a friend. So, when they are about to invite you to "Chi Jiang Cha," they will definitely ask you first: "Do you have old friends?" If you can name a few old friends at this time (but you need to consider whether you have a real friendship with them; if you don't, you shouldn't randomly drag them in, otherwise, things will get worse), and the friendship is strong enough, then things will be easier to handle. Often, it can be resolved with a few words on the spot. Even if it's not resolved, when you arrive at the appointed "tea gathering" (tea houses where "old friends" often gather), if you bring the "old friends" you know along, one or two doesn't matter, everyone exchanges "qie kou" (切口, slang), and the matter can be resolved immediately. Otherwise, if your old friend gives an order (this requires someone with a little face), or sends two young guys to the scene, because the mediators have their own territories. If the friendship is strong enough, of course, they can go anywhere (the so-called "sihai" 四海, all over the world) friends who "dou de zhuan" (兜得轉, get around), from Longhua in the south to Wusong in the north, can visit each other anywhere). Otherwise, "guang gun bu dang cai lu" (光棍不擋財路, a bachelor doesn't block the path to wealth), and you need to clearly understand the principles. In addition, you should also use some indirect methods. Sometimes, two senior "old heads" with many followers might as well meet and explain the misunderstanding in person. This is "Chi Jiang Cha" between "old friends" themselves. The so-called "brothers argue within the walls" (兄弟閱於牆) often happens now, but it has very little to do with outsiders, so this article won't elaborate.</p>
<p>"A hero doesn't suffer immediate losses" (好漢不吃眼前虧) is something everyone can understand. The meaning of this article is to tell you: if you unfortunately encounter this sudden event, how should you deal with it? Earlier, I said that it's easier to resolve if you have old friends. But,</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>what if you don't have old friends? The only way is to be adaptable. Because, if the loafers want to be very rude to you, they wouldn't bother inviting you to a tea gathering. The fact that they invited you to a tea gathering means they are still being polite. You might as well temporarily endure your grievances, show no emotion, or even be generous and amicable in dealing with them. You might as well indirectly lead them to reveal what they want from you. Because sometimes they care about face and won't mention money, eating, and drinking, but will talk about principles. This is their way of hinting that you should find a way to bring the discussion to the main topic, so you just bring it to the main topic. Of course, if you have old friends, that's another matter, because making friends always involves money, eating, and drinking. When you get to the main topic, you should make things clear in advance: you can talk about the bad economic situation, the lack of business, and although you appreciate the "old friends" looking up to you, your resources are limited. Of course, you don't dare to refuse the good intentions of the "old friends," and you hope they will forgive you, etc. On the other hand, you should observe the style of the people who came to "軋" (press, bother) you, such as their appearance, attire, and speech. Pay attention to who among them is the leader, or whether they always speak in unison. You should adapt to the situation and look for a way to step down easily. In short, never lose your temper; or stutter, unable to form complete sentences, revealing a completely weak demeanor. You must be soft but firm, firm but soft, carefully observe, and respond smoothly. If they clearly understand your financial situation, and see that you are not a country bumpkin, and that your words and actions are appropriate, they will also feel that making trouble unreasonably is not the way, and will gradually become frank with you. At the same time, admiring your fearless spirit, calmness in the face of adversity, courage, and intelligence will also stir up the chivalry and bloodiness of the heroes in the underworld, although sometimes money, eating, and drinking will cover up this chivalry and bloodiness. When you see this situation, that's when the opportunity comes. You must seize this point and state: "Everyone, 'a first meeting is like strangers, a second meeting is like old friends.' Although I haven't 'pressed' old friends in the past, I am willing to make friends with you all from this day on." I think this set of words, used to deal with the "old friends" for the so-called "yang pan" (dupe) or "kong zi" (sucker), is very suitable, beneficial and harmless. An ancient saying goes: "If you admit you are wrong first, people won't blame you; if you lie down on the ground first, who will hit you." To deal with "Chi Qing Cha" (eating invitation tea), you should remember this saying even more. If you want to fundamentally avoid these troubles, you can only restrain your own behavior in peacetime, so that people have no opportunity to take advantage of you!</p>
<p>Industry Practices</p>
<h3>Silk Factory Foreman's Guide: Selecting and Boiling Cocoons</h3>
<p>— Lizhen</p>
<p>As a silk factory foreman, one must understand general factory management methods, such as understanding the various personalities of workers, and methods of supervision and guidance. However, these are things that must be known to manage any factory, not just a silk factory. Secondly, one must know the general techniques of silk reeling, such as the temperature of the silk reeling soup, the volume of the silk reeling pot, the method of holding the cocoon, the method of reeling the silk, the method of increasing the amount of silk, and the method of increasing the efficiency of silk production. All these should be fully understood by the silk factory foreman. However, these have become specialized problems, and the content is very complicated, so it is not convenient to introduce them here. What I want to talk about now is a kind of work that the foreman must first know, and that is the selection and boiling of cocoons. As for the rest, you will gradually learn it after being a foreman for many years.</p>
<p>Before there were mechanized silk factories, we had already learned some primitive silk reeling methods in the countryside, such as boiling cocoons, baking cocoons, reeling silk, and adding silk. At that time, the methods were very old and simple, and not suitable for modern factories. Even the semi-mechanized handicraft factories and silk factories were generally simple and did not fully adopt scientific methods, so they did not require specialized knowledge and skills. But now it is different, and the selection and boiling of cocoons in silk reeling have become one of our specialized knowledge.</p>
<p>The fineness or carelessness of cocoon selection has a great impact on the silk yield project. Thin-skinned cocoons and cotton cocoons are related to the uniformity of the silk. Dead pupa cocoons and dirty cocoons (commonly known as blood cocoons) are related to the quality of raw silk. These are very important matters. However, the foreman should strictly warn: the general psychology of cocoon selectors is only that they think that the same cocoon, dirty cocoon, and dead pupa cocoon are related to the quality of silk reeling, and they select them out, but they do not pay much attention to cotton cocoons and thin-headed cocoons. If this is the case, no matter how complete the cocoon boiling method is, it is absolutely impossible to unravel them in the same way as good cocoons. As a result, the silk yield is reduced, there are more breaks, and the thickness is uneven. Those who have visited Japanese silk factories know that their cocoon varieties are better than ours, but cocoon selection is more meticulous than ours, which is worthy of our learning.</p>
<p>But what kind of cocoons should we select out? There are dead pupa cocoons, same power cocoons, irregular cocoons, cluster cocoons (the outside of the cocoon has firewood marks, or board shape, commonly known as firewood cocoon), dirty cocoons, maggot cocoons, cotton cocoons (this kind of cocoon, its silk layer structure is poor, easy to overheat when boiled, more tangled bubbles, the most bad), nutmeg-shaped cocoons, bald cocoons, thin-headed cocoons (this kind of cocoon is woven by the silkworm when it suffers from breathing in too much moisture or carbon in the air, opening a clear window at the top, becoming soup cocoons when reeling silk).</p>
<p>If you are reeling slightly coarser weave silk, you should pay more attention to thin-skinned cocoons, cotton cocoons, and small cocoons. On the contrary, if you are reeling slightly finer weave silk, it is easier to select large cocoons. The greatest impact on the color of silk is the silk and silk flakes reeled from dead pupa cocoons and dirty cocoons. The color of our country's silk is far inferior to that of Japan, and the value is also very different, which is caused by not paying attention to the stain on the silk.</p>
<p>The purpose of boiling cocoons is to make the silk soft and dissolve, so that it can be extracted in order, and on the other hand, it is good to make several strands of silk into a single strand, some are fourteen strands of silk and some are twenty-one strands of silk (that is, fourteen strands are combined into one strand, or twenty-one strands are combined into one strand), so the cocoons must be boiled with high-temperature soup. The outside of the silk strand has a kind of granular sericin, which is heated by hot soup, part of which dissolves in the hot soup, and part of which softens and expands, so that the glued silk strands are separated. Because the solvent of the soup medium is different, the solubility of sericin is also fast or slow.</p>
<p>When boiling cocoons, we should know the following: The first is the amount of cocoons boiled. If you focus on the quality of the silk, you can slightly reduce the amount. If you do not focus on the quality but focus on efficiency, you can slightly increase the amount. But an excellent cooker can boil slightly more cocoons, which is why he is more efficient. Cocoons that are easy to unravel (spring cocoons) can be slightly more, otherwise slightly less. Autumn cocoons with light cocoon weight and overly dry cocoons can be slightly less. In short, the amount of cocoons boiled is roughly one bucket of cocoons divided into ten or twelve times to boil.</p>
<p>The amount of water in the cocoon boiling machine is about five points up and down from the upper edge. The upper edge of the cocoon-containing crying should not be exposed to the air. Also, the water or soup in the cocoon boiling machine facing up should be supplied to eight points, and then steam is sent in. However, the capacity of the soup at this time expands due to the steam pressure, plus the distilled water that is cooled in cold water after the steam is added, and the water in the cocoon boiler is filled. The amount of soup, the shaking of the cocoon, the change of steam pressure, the turbidity of the soup, and the heat economy are all affected.</p>
<p>Also, pay attention to the concentration of the cocoon boiling soup. The ingredients contained in the cocoon boiling soup are the original ingredients in the water and the ingredients that are gradually leached out into the cocoon boiling soup as the number of cocoon boiling increases, such as sericin, protein and fat of the pupal exudates, and various inorganic components. The concentration of the cocoon boiling soup gradually increases, the concentration of water and electricity ions also gradually increases, and it becomes acidic. Therefore, the increase in the concentration in the soup, the less the dissolution of the sericin in the cocoon layer, the worse the unraveling of the cocoon, and the silk yield tends to gradually increase. The amount of the unraveling agent and the silk increasing agent added to the cocoon boiling soup and the silk reeling soup should also be changed according to the concentration of the boiling soup and the silk reeling soup. Therefore, the concentration of the cocoon boiling soup must be moderate. But this also depends on the quality of the cocoon.</p>
<p>The second is the temperature of boiling cocoons: the temperature of boiling cocoons varies depending on the time of boiling and the quality of the cocoons. Cocoon boiling is divided into three parts: pre-boiling, penetration, and post-boiling. The pre-boiling part (that is, the high temperature part) is inside and outside of Fahrenheit cold and heat, the penetration part (that is, the warm part) is inside and outside of one hundred and forty degrees, and the post-boiling part is inside and outside of one hundred and ninety degrees. The percentage of the time is 35% for the former and 65% for the latter.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the cocoon boiling time has a high temperature time and a low temperature time, the former is short and the latter is long. If the cocoon quality is good, the sericin is easy to dissolve, the degree of dryness is high, and the cocoon boiling soup is light, the cocoon boiling time can be shortened. Conversely, it can also be extended. However, we should pay attention to the fact that the shorter the cocoon boiling time, the greater the danger. The same is true for being too long.</p>
<p>In addition, the protection of boiled cocoons, the treatment of boiled cocoons, and the steam pressure used for boiling cocoons must be paid attention to. Now we can put forward the general points that should be paid attention to when boiling cocoons. The steam pressure should not be increased or decreased suddenly. If it is morning or evening or during a rainstorm, you should be more careful. The interval between the cocoon container and the cocoon container should be 1 inch to 8 points. Before boiling cocoons, put three or four empty containers into the soup in succession, and then continuously put in containers containing cocoons to boil cocoons. Before boiling cocoons, carefully check whether there are any obstacles in the various parts of the machine. After boiling cocoons, be sure to sweep and clean. Pay attention to the degree of cookedness, and also maintain a certain degree of cooked cocoons to supply the reelers. In addition, the turbidity and amount of the soup temperature, the temperature of the barrel temperature, etc. should also be paid attention to.</p>
<p>Celebrity Interview</p>
<h3>Du Chongyuan Talks About Prison Life</h3>
<p>— Zhao Xu</p>
<p>I am very happy that I met Mr. Du Chongyuan unintentionally this time. Why do I say it was intentional? When the news of "Mr. Du's restoration of freedom" came out, I expected that the entire Shanghai press would inevitably go to interview him as usual; and Mr. Du would also refuse to see them as usual on the pretext of illness. Therefore, I intentionally did not join in the fun. In addition to making a phone call to ask Mr. Ding Huikang, the director of the Hongqiao Sanatorium, I sent a letter to the editor of this weekly magazine to ask about "how I could meet Mr. Du unexpectedly." He gave me a good idea. Sure enough, in less than five days, I met Mr. Du. It was during the luncheon when he was happily meeting with his friends.</p>
<p>Mr. Du is a man in his thirties, with a very burly figure, but a very amiable attitude, and a constant smile on his face. His accent is Liaoning with a bit of Beijing Mandarin, and his speech is loud and fluent. When one of his relatives introduced me to him, he seemed to limit the scope, saying: "I hope you don't describe this very ordinary experience of mine as a major event!"</p>
<p>I hurriedly said: "I just want to know about your life in prison."</p>
<p>Within this scope, our conversation continued.</p>
<p>"I heard that you were initially..." in the Caohejing Jiangsu Second Model Prison, and later applied for bail due to illness, and the Second Branch of the High Court designated you to be transferred to the Hongqiao Sanatorium for diagnosis. So, you were only in prison for a few months, and the rest of the time you were lying in the hospital, right?" I began to ask him.</p>
<p>"I was only in the Second Prison for four or five months, that's right!" Mr. Du said: "However, when I was in the hospital, there were also several sergeants and detectives guarding me."</p>
<p>At this time, one of Mr. Du's relatives told me again: "When he was detained in Caohejing, his wife, Ms. Hou Yuzhi, moved the... ancestral hall of the family (similar to...), so that she could send him food and miscellaneous items at any time. On the one hand, she ran around among friends to find ways to rescue him, and on the other hand, she filed an appeal with the Supreme Court. As a result of the appeal, the Supreme Court ruled that the appeal was allowed and the execution of the sentence was suspended. During the appeal period, he was still temporarily detained in the Second Prison. However, because he was 'awaiting investigation' and not a convicted criminal, the treatment was still good."</p>
<p>Mr. Du: "What was your life like in the Second Prison?"</p>
<p>"Besides eating and sleeping, I just read books." Mr. Du said: "However, before I went to prison, my life was too disorganized: I didn't eat at a fixed time every day; nor did I sleep at a fixed time. After entering prison, eating and sleeping had fixed times, so I felt I could take the opportunity to recuperate."</p>
<p>"What kind of books did you read?"</p>
<p>"I felt that in the past, although my blood, courage, and energy were not bad, I still lacked careful calculation. So in prison, I specialized in reading economics books."</p>
<p>"What else besides reading?"</p>
<p>"The time for free exercise was also set by myself and treated as a course."</p>
<p>"Then where was it held?"</p>
<p>"Originally, if..."</p>
<p>—When the authorities allowed Du to go to the Hongqiao Sanatorium for recuperation, Du (with ○) smiled cheerfully—</p>
<p>—Du was once imprisoned in a high-walled cell with a patio in the Caohejing Jiangsu Second Prison. Because the weather was hot, there was a reed awning over the patio—</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>I was a criminal who had been convicted and interrogated with other criminals, then of course I would have to exercise with them at the time specified in the prison regulations. The place where I was detained was another separate cell, and there was a patio outside this room. That can really be considered a patio, because it was surrounded by high walls on all sides. I was active in that patio."</p>
<p>"Were you usually locked up in the cell?"</p>
<p>"No! Because I was an unconvicted prisoner at that time. Also, I am grateful to my relatives and friends: on the one hand, they asked the prison authorities to treat me differently; on the other hand, someone sent me a sleeping chair for sitting and lying down; and someone sent me a parrot in a cage. The parrot could call and speak, which could relieve my loneliness, and it was unusually tame. Sometimes you let it out of the cage, and it wouldn't escape."</p>
<p>At this time, one of his relatives said again: "At first, people sent him this 'caged bird,' and we were afraid that he would be more uncomfortable because he was emotionally affected by the scenery. Who knew that he loved this bird very much."</p>
<p>Mr. Du said with a smile: "This can be considered as sympathizing with each other!"</p>
<p>"I heard that the separate cell where Mr. Du lived was originally prepared for the famous international political prisoner 'Niu Lan' to live in. Later, he didn't come to live in it, so it was empty for some time."</p>
<p>"I haven't heard that said." Mr. Du's relative continued: "However, I once heard that a big foreigner lived there."</p>
<p>"Is the equipment there different from ordinary prisons?"</p>
<p>"There is nothing different!" Mr. Du's relative said again, "Only a canopy was built in the patio to protect against the scorching sun. Some of the furniture in the room was newly added, and he was allowed to bring more food, books, and small utensils, etc."</p>
<p>"Did people often visit Mr. Du in prison?"</p>
<p>"It was nothing more than his wife and her parents and the closest relatives, and they had to get special permission from the prison authorities. They also had to follow the regulations and could not leave or stay at will."</p>
<p>"Were they able to go to his cell?"</p>
<p>"After special permission, they could meet in the patio of his cell."</p>
<p>"What about the meals every day?"</p>
<p>"This was also specially prepared by... and sent to the prison after inspection, and then brought to the cell to eat."</p>
<p>"What time did Mr. Du go to sleep and what time did he get up every day?"</p>
<p>"There was a wake-up call every day in the prison. I got up when I heard the call, and I had to turn off the lights and go to sleep when the lights-out call was blown." Mr. Du replied.</p>
<p>"When did you get bail to the Hongqiao Sanatorium?"</p>
<p>"That was after the Supreme Court ruled that the appeal was allowed, and the weather was getting cold. I suffered from a severe cold and cough, so my family requested bail for medical treatment, and I went there after getting permission from the authorities."</p>
<p>"What was the living situation in the Hongqiao Sanatorium?"</p>
<p>"At first, it was diagnosis and treatment; later, I continued to recuperate. The rules of life were completely in accordance with the doctor's instructions. I didn't read books when I was diagnosed. I just took medicine, rested, slept peacefully, and ate some nourishing things every day. After I recovered a little, I started to read newspapers, take a walk, and meet with relatives and friends."</p>
<p>"Is it more free than in prison?"</p>
<p>"It's about the same. However, it is more convenient to eat and drink, and you can walk on the large terrace and lawn. Although a sergeant, Mr. Hou, is often with me, the environment is a beautiful suburban sanatorium, so naturally I feel much more comfortable."</p>
<p>"Can visitors move freely?"</p>
<p>"They can't. They must get permission from the sergeant and be with him to... talk."</p>
<p>"What did Mr. Du do in Jiujiang?"</p>
<p>"Is that a rumor in the newspaper?"</p>
<p>Mr. Du said: "Maybe because I used to run a porcelain business, so that's what they said? However, my body has not recovered yet, and I still want to recuperate for a while before I talk about it."</p>
<p>"Did Mr. Du's porcelain company develop well?"</p>
<p>"Before I went to prison, the one in the Northeast had closed down, and the one in Jiujiang is currently suspended. I am afraid that it will have to be greatly reorganized in the future."</p>
<p>"I heard that Mr. Du wants to travel to the interior, such as Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, etc. Do you have this intention?"</p>
<p>"I heard that some of my relatives and friends want to invite me to Hangzhou... and said that if I want to go to Jiujiang, it would be better to travel from Zhejiang and Jiangxi... and then... that's how the speculation arose, right? I really haven't made up my mind myself."</p>
<p>Afterwards, I heard Mr. Du's relative say that his brother-in-law, Mr. Hou, who rushed to Shanghai because Mr. Du was imprisoned, has transferred to a middle school in Shanghai; Mr. Du's residence in... has not been unsubscribed. His wife, Ms. Hou, has also suffered from illness due to hard work and overwork. Her illness has now healed, but her body is still very weak, so she probably won't travel far for the time being, right?</p>
<p>I talked to Mr. Du that day and then left because of something, but unfortunately I didn't get to see him and his relatives and friends having a good time together, but the impression he gave me was deep enough.</p>

<h3>Wild Rabbits as a Pest</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>On Australian pastures there is a small shrub whose leaves are the main food for sheep during dry periods. But at the same time these leaves are also a great food for wild rabbits, and without it, countless wild rabbits would not be able to survive during the drought. In this way, wild rabbits have become the most harmful thing in this area. The Scientific and Industrial Research Assessment Council of the area has concentrated its efforts to invent some of the most effective methods to eliminate wild rabbits, but the results still cannot eliminate them. According to the survey, this area spends millions of pounds every year to drive away wild rabbits; due to the abandonment of pastures by wild rabbits, the harvest of wool and mutton is reduced by 100 million pounds. At the same time, the skin and meat of the captured wild rabbits are only worth millions of pounds when exported abroad every year. Comparing the two, the damage is really great, so the people of the area feel deeply pained by the wild rabbits. According to their estimates, if the wild rabbits could be removed, the area's sheep production would increase by 25 percent compared to normal!</p>

<h3>Delicacies and Health</h3>
<p>— Ke</p>
<p>The wealthy in the city often eat delicacies and drink blood-tonifying wine, but they are either bloated or pale and rarely healthy. The farmers in the countryside often eat corn and vegetables, but they are mostly strong and healthy and free of disease. Furthermore, city dwellers have an endless supply of delicacies from land and sea, but unfortunately, they often suffer from stomach ailments. Many country and city folk also suffer from stomach ailments, but their stomach ailments are not due to indigestion but rather a deficiency of the stomach, lacking anything to digest. Based on these facts, we can draw two conclusions: first, eating good food does not necessarily make one healthy; and second, overeating and undereating both lead to illness, a characteristic of the current age.</p>
<p>According to a report by a certain famous American medical doctor, a businessman recently suffered from a strange disease. The symptom was that every day at 11 a.m. he would fall into a state of extreme sleep. No matter how much noise was made during his sleep, he would not wake up. Several times he had driven his car through crowded areas and encountered danger because the disease would suddenly strike, causing him to fall asleep. Many famous doctors investigated this strange disease but could not determine its cause. Later, they specially investigated his diet and discovered that he ate cream and coffee every morning. So, the doctor ordered him to stop eating cream, and the strange disease gradually disappeared. There was also a university student who developed a disease that caused pain all over his body, preventing him from doing anything. At first, it was thought to be a mental illness, but it was later determined that it was also caused by eating too much good food. Because he ate two to four eggs every day, he could not digest them, resulting in his serious illness.</p>

<h3>Germany's Oil Problem</h3>
<p>— Chong</p>
<p>In its wartime economic development, the most important problem for the "Third Reich," which is diligently preparing for war, is the problem of fuel, the problem of oil.</p>
<p>Although Germany is a powerful heavy industry country, it does not have a good oil base. Recently, Berlin published a document pointing out that when the First World War broke out in 1914, the oil problem was not given special attention, so this problem caused the German authorities great pain at the end of the war. However, at that time, by strengthening the production of petroleum and coal liquefaction products, and by purchasing oil produced in Romania during the war, the problem was considerably alleviated. But now? The actual situation is fundamentally different. According to calculations by Berlin experts, the wartime organization of the German army has 300 divisions, including 30 divisions with 10,400 tanks and transport vehicles, 9,000 aircraft, and mechanized divisions equipped with airfields and air defense equipment. The displacement of naval warships and seaplanes is 500,000 to 600,000 tons. Thus, Germany's wartime fuel needs are estimated to be more than 12 million tons per year. However, Germany's domestic fuel production in 1934 was only 850,000 tons, and last year it only increased to 1.1 million to 1.15 million tons. This large gap between needs and production fully demonstrates that Germany's current oil problem is much more serious than during the last war.</p>
<p>Currently, Germany is in the development phase of war preparations, and the production of automobiles and transport vehicles is increasing daily. According to statistics, automobile production in 1932 was 43,400 vehicles, which increased to 201,400 vehicles last year. The production of transport vehicles in 1932 was 8,000 vehicles, which increased to 38,800 vehicles last year. In addition, the production of aircraft and tanks has also greatly increased. In this way, Germany's fuel needs are naturally increasing.</p>
<p>Once a war breaks out, commercial relations between the belligerents will be completely severed, and oil, as an important military material, will naturally be embargoed. Germany's domestic oil production is so weak, and its needs are so great. If a war breaks out and there are problems with the import of foreign oil, then the "Second Reich's" cars and tanks will not be able to move, aircraft will not be able to fly high, and full mobilization of warships will be difficult. What a terrible danger! Therefore, in recent years, the National Socialist government has been doing everything possible to increase oil production in order to achieve German oil self-sufficiency. We can specifically discuss a few points:</p>
<p>First, the extraction of crude oil. Since 1934, the German government has been working to expand oil producing areas. In that year, the government spent huge amounts of subsidies, adding 54 new oil wells, covering an area of 53 kilometers. Later, it increased to 85 wells, expanding the area to 99 kilometers. Last October, many new oil producing areas were discovered, which of course further expanded the area of oil producing areas. As a result, Germany's crude oil production last year almost doubled compared to 1933 (Editor's note: Production in 1933 was 219,000 tons, and in 1935 it was 430,000 tons).</p>
<p>However, this increase in crude oil production came at a great cost. Moreover, the quality of these crude oils is only suitable for refining lubricating oil and is not very suitable for fuel. So, although the quantity has increased, it is of little benefit to Germany, which is preparing for war.</p>
<p>Second, the production of petroleum and other coal carbonization products. Currently, Germany has 40 million tons of lignite production, all of which is used for this purpose. According to Dr. Hurotai's calculations, in theory, 1.6 million tons of black mineral oil can be extracted from it, and 960,000 tons of petroleum, 200,000 tons of fuel black mineral oil, and 50,000 tons of lubricating oil can be extracted from it. However, when theoretical calculations are moved to practical implementation, many difficulties arise. The result is only a small increase in fuel production, and the problem is not solved at all. At the same time, the forced implementation of this artificial method consumes too much, which further increases the wartime budget and creates more problems for the national finances.</p>
<p>Third, efforts to liquefy coal. This method has gone through many difficulties, and only now has it achieved some results. Therefore, the German military has great hope for the production of coal-liquefied oil, fantasizing that it can solve Germany's fuel problem. However, judging from the recent situation, that fantasy will probably forever remain a fantasy. For example, the various chemicals and raw materials required in coal liquefaction cannot be smoothly resolved first.</p>
<p>In short, under the current circumstances, the German government will try every means that can be used to extract oil and produce fuel. For example, efforts to produce alcohol and gas are aimed at increasing the supply of fuel. However, every artificial fuel manufacturing method has the problem of excessively high production costs. Products with such high production costs naturally cannot compete with foreign goods in the German market. Therefore, the German government specially uses tariffs to protect domestic oil. However, in this way, the "Third Reich's" tariff revenue has suffered a great loss. At the same time, because Germany needs a large amount of oil, even if its domestic oil production increases annually, and even if it uses tariffs to protect domestic oil, a large amount of oil is still imported into Germany in recent years. According to statistics, Germany's fuel imports in 1933 were 2.65 million tons, and by last year, they had increased to 3.77 million tons. This year's statistics are certainly more than this. Judging from this simple statistic alone, we can also know the seriousness of Germany's current oil problem.</p>
<p>In order to increase the production of oil fuel, in addition to the above-mentioned artificial methods of manufacturing oil and fuel, the German government previously combined the ten major lignite companies with 250 million marks to strive to produce petroleum. Recently, it was decided to invest huge amounts of funds in 1936 and 1937. According to their estimates, under many favorable conditions, Germany can produce 1 million tons of synthetic petroleum in 1937. However, this is still a very small number compared to the amount of fuel Germany needs in wartime as described above. This situation clearly tells us that Germany's efforts to achieve oil self-sufficiency have been declared a failure.</p>
<p>Due to war preparations, due to the lack of oil, and due to the failure of efforts to achieve oil self-sufficiency, Germany has to pay more attention to choosing allies in future wars. In this selection, it is necessary to find a country with abundant oil production, which has led to the emergence of pro-British and pro-American factions in the German military. At the same time, Romania, in the Little Entente, also has abundant oil production, and therefore the country has also been quite attentive to Hitler. Recently, the reorganization of the Romanian cabinet has shown a pro-German tendency. It is argued that this is the effect of the National Socialist Party. If so, it further demonstrates that Germany's oil problem is not only a major domestic problem, but also has a deep relationship with Germany's diplomacy and, therefore, with international political economy.</p>

<h3>Revision of the Law of Universal Gravitation</h3>
<p>— Enlightenment</p>
<p>In the physics textbooks currently used in schools, the basic principles of mechanics are still based on Newton's three laws of motion, and Newton's "Law of Universal Gravitation" is still being reviewed in the same old way, with no new elements added. Except for some common sense of new mechanical principles that have been heard or introduced in some specialized natural science magazines, the lecture halls of the science department of the university still use the original Western version of the 19th century for lectures, which cannot but be regretted by our academic and educational circles!</p>
<p>Before talking about the revision of Newton's law of universal gravitation, we might as well describe the general idea of universal gravitation.</p>
<p>One day, when Newton was playing in the park, he happened to see an apple falling to the ground from a tree, and thus he realized the earth's attraction, thinking that the fall of the apple was due to the attraction of the earth's center. Extending this further, he also thought that the rotation of the earth and other planets around the sun without separation was also due to the sun's attraction of the earth and other planets. Similarly, the moon's orbit around the earth, the orbits of other satellites around other planets, and the attachment of various objects on the earth to the earth are all due to this reason. Therefore, the theory of universal gravitation was derived, and its law is as follows:</p>
<p>In the universe, relative objects attract each other, regardless of their distance. The magnitude of the force is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the objects and inversely proportional to the square of their distance.</p>
<p>The product of the mass of the earth is greater than the product of the masses of various objects on the earth's surface, and the distance is the closest. Therefore, the apple must fall on the earth's surface, and not on the moon's surface, nor on the surface of the sun or its planets. The moon must depend on the earth, and the earth and other planets must orbit the sun. According to universal gravitation, plus the attraction and repulsion of the mutual attraction and repulsion forces, it can also be proven. Newton's law of universal gravitation is roughly as described above. This is the mechanical principle that has been regarded as the benchmark by the mechanics community for a hundred years.</p>
<p>But all academics are advancing, and they are constantly evolving, and the law of universal gravitation is no exception.</p>
<p>Before talking about the revision of the law of universal gravitation, we might as well first describe the situation of the new mechanics produced from the old mechanics. The foundation of the old mechanics is Newton's law of motion. This law requires assuming an absolutely stationary reference body in the universe as the coordinate for measuring the moving body. But now we know that this hypothesis is unreasonable, because the "ether" that he used as the absolutely stationary reference body has long been proven unnecessary and mysterious in modern physics. There is absolutely no non-object and non-moving thing in space. Furthermore, the old mechanics believed that length, time, and mass are constant and invariable. But now it has long been proven that these three change during the movement process and are relatively defined. The old mechanics' concept of force assumes an absolutely stationary reference body. An object with acceleration relative to the reference body is subject to force. Now that there is no need to assume this absolutely stationary reference body, natural phenomena must be examined with the observer as the standard, so the concept of mechanics must be revised from the beginning.</p>
<p>For example, passengers on an airplane seem to feel their weight decreasing when they start to descend. If the plane descends at "gravitational acceleration," the passenger will feel as if he has completely lost his weight. If you look at it from a standard body outside the plane, then the passenger is moving at "gravitational speed," and at the same time, it can be said that he is subject to the action of gravity. However, if the passenger takes himself as the standard and does not look outside, then he does not even know his own movement, and his own weight - that is, the gravity exerted on himself</p>
