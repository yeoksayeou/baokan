<h3>重要協議後　日决派桑島馳赴南京　對川越大使傳達新决議案　將日方眞實意向軒致蔣張　藏相稱目前不致發生衝突</h3>
<p>（東京）日政府二日晨决定派遺外務省束亞局長桑島赴南京、對川越大使傳達新决議案、桑島或於二日晚離此首途赴華、（二日中央社電）</p>
<p>（東京）日首相廣田、今晨九時十五分復召集外相有田·海相永野陸軍次官梅津、舉行會議、外務省亞洲局長桑島、亦參與會議、關於中日局勢交換情報、並彼此交換意見、嗣關於根據最近發展之對華交涉新計劃、亦加以透澈之討論、會議結果、决派遣外務省亞洲局長桑島赴南京、傳達重要使命、外務省發言人、頃解釋派遣桑島赴華之原因、謂川越大使與外務省之間、對南京舉行之談判、雖曾屢由電報往來互換意見、但雙方於電文中、均不能充分表示意見、且日政府認為有將日本眞實意向、轉達蔣院長及張外長之必要云、又日藏相馬塲、今日首途赴大阪、臨行前語各訪員稱、中國時局、不應引起恐慌、蓋目前似不致發生衝突、（二日中央社電）</p>
<p>（東京）據外務省發言人今日官稱、政府决將對華之意志、交東亞局長桑島親自送達駐華日大使川越、桑島將於今晚啟程赴滬、此舉乃由政府要員開會根據中國方面傳來之消息討論中日現局最近發展時所决定者、與會者有首相廣田海相永野外相有田陸軍次長梅津等、散會後卽舉行內閣會議、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>（南京）日大使館秘書須磨、二日下午五時半到外部訪次長陳介、略談二十分鐘辭出、（二日專電）</p>
<p>（東京）桑島局長之匆遽赴南京、已見前電、於此中日交涉之際、外務省局長携本國政府之訓令案馳往中國之首都、為前例所無、於此足知中日交涉緊張之度、（二日同盟電）</p>
<p>（東京）桑島東亞局長、定今夜九時三十分、携三省會議所决定之具體案、由東京赴南京、向川越大使傳達、（二同盟電）</p>
<p>（東京）對華交涉之形勢益形混沌、兩國國交之緊迫程度、亦日甚一日、廣田首相於二日上午之閣議前、在首相官邸召集有田外相·永野海相·梅津陸軍次官·桑島東亞局長等、以各省所接到之情報為中心、舉行重要協議、（二日同盟電）</p>
<p>（東京）停頓中之中日交涉、因蔣氏日內遝京、預期四五日中可正式開始、外務陸海軍當局連日開對策協議會、復以協議會所决定之方策為基礎、由廣田首相有田外相永野海相梅津次官等政府首腦部愼重熟議、外務當局二日午後零時半、關於此事發表意見、此次中日交涉之結果、意義極為重大、蓋中日關係已到因此頗為好轉或非常惡化之重大歧路、故帝國政府以愼重之態度、應付交涉、同時認現在之時局頗為重大、故帝國政府須將政府之眞意、向蔣院長張外長充分徹底、自此次交涉開始以來、雖藉電報之往復、隨時傳達帝國政府之意響、然僅電文、有未能十分盡意之感、故有田外相於本日（二日）派桑島東亞局長馳赴南京、向川越大使充分傳達政府之眞意、俾於今後交涉、貫徹日方之主張、（二日同盟電）</p>
<p>（東京）奉有田外相之命、馳赴南京之桑島東亞局長、定二日午後九時半由東京驛出發、三日上午十一時、由神戶乘長崎丸直航上海、轉往南京、會見川越大使、留南京兩三日、完畢使命後、至急歸國、向有田外相復命、以備今後中日交涉之展開、（二日同盟電）</p>

<p>（東京）外務省發言人今日接見報界中人時、有問以近來中日局勢是否已增嚴重者、該發言入答稱、渠未之知、蔣院長何時返京、渠未接有確切情報、惟聞南京現正準備慶祝全國之統一、當談話之際、該發言人因須與外務長其他長官會商事務、曾離開十分鐘之久、迨返、乃出下文向衆宣讀曰、「有田外相曾於九月二十八日吿報界中人、目前中日之談判殊形嚴重、中國現方處於歧路口、日政府現以甚審愼之態度辦理談判、同時大局殊形嚴重、故吾人承認有以日本其正之意志傳達蔣介石將軍與張羣將軍之必要、吾人固與川越大使交換電文、惟因電文不能傳達吾人充分之意義、故外相决議派桑島（外務省亞洲局長）前往中國、以日政府之意志面達川越、」（二日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）日本外務省發言人天羽昨日下午發表一文、對路透電社作劇烈之抨擊、責路透電社在世界各處發表關於日本對中國提出要求之電訊、發言人謂此訊乃以別有用意志在離間中日之幻想的宣傳為根據、今或須取相當辦法、制止此種行為云、同盟社亦已廣播同樣之抨擊言論、查日外務省發言人所抨擊之電訊、乃倫敦路透電社發至世界各處者、文曰、「路透社自倫敦外交方面探悉日本向中國提出之解决爭端條件、內有（一）揚子江各地點駐兵、以保護日僑之權利、（二）校訂敎科書、以防杜向中國學童官傳排日情緒之權利、（三）華北五省之自治、（四）中日經濟合作、其特殊性質、尙未親定、聞英政府現由其駐東京南京大使密切注視中日談判之進行、」查其他電訊社亦皆傳出同樣消息、而日外務省獨對路透社施其抨擊、邇來外間對於日大使川越在南京進行談判時提出之要求、謠言孔多、路透社對於此項謠言、向甚謹愼處之、路透社所發之電訊、泰半取材於日人報紙、蓋邇來日文報紙登載南京談判情形甚為詳盡也、例如九月二十一日路透社曾引用讀賣新聞所載之下列要求、「以河北察哈爾山東山西綏遠五省闢為緩衝區域、南京政府州仍享有對該區之宗主權、惟官吏之黜陟權賦稅權軍事統制權等、均應移交地方自治政府、（二）利用目前機會臨時解决中日間交通合同之複雜問題、而尤重航空一項、（三）中國將九一八事變後對日貨所施之稅則、作根本的修正、（四）中國儘量聘用日人為顧問、路透社適於同日引用日外務省發言人之言、謂報紙所載關於日本對中國所提出可能的要求之豫料、大半根據於理想云、（二日路透社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>被忘郤的軍縮問題</h3>
<p>在黷武主義的國家積極備戰。威脅着愛好和平的國家的時候。軍縮問題是容易被人遺忘的。這次國聯大會七個委員會中間。只有軍縮委員會的主席。沒有產生。法國代表台爾博斯發出了重開世界軍縮會議以維和平的呼籲。不獨沒有獲得有力者的共鳴。而且引起匈牙利代表唐作斯的相反的意見來。</p>
<p>軍縮會議自歐戰以後。已開過好多次了。其中除華盛頓會議對主力艦的限制。倫敦會議對補助艦的限制略有局部的次議外。一九三二年二月開幕的軍縮會議。祗通過了若干紅十字會式的决議案。一九三三年一月開幕的軍縮會議。祗產生了英法德意四國壟斷歐洲政局的四强協定。而同年十月開幕的軍縮會議。則不但絲毫沒有關於裁軍的具體决議。反鬧出了德國退會的笑話。開黷武主義者公開擴張軍備的先例。到現在不但凡爾賽和的中的軍事條欵已為德國所撕碎。卽華盛頓和倫敦兩海的也為日本所丟棄了。</p>
<p>軍備的擴充是有傳染性的。自黷武主義的國家公開擴充軍備以後。凡是愛好和平的國家亦不得不相對地擴充軍備。以對抗威脅和平的武力。所以世界各國的軍備費用無不增加。擴柏林景氣研究所的調查。一九三五年的世界軍備費比一九二九年的增加了二分之一。比諸大戰以前的一九一三年。則已增加了三倍。而今年度各國的軍費預算。比諸去年更有增加。其中美國增加百分之一六。英國百分之二〇。日本百分之三六。法國百分之八〇。這種無限制擴張軍備的結果。會增加財政上的恐慌。而引起政局的不安。所以有許多愛好和平的國家。很希望這種無益的競爭能够早日終止。法國台爾博斯重開軍縮會議的呼籲。也就根據于這个希望。</p>
<p>不過在黷武主義的國家看來。由擴張軍備而引起的非常財政的負担。是可以轉嫁給殖民地大衆的。而國內政局的不安也可以用對外發展的手段來緩和下去。所以重開軍縮會議的建議在當今的世界局勢之下。實在很少貫澈的可能性。卽使此項會議能够重開。也不免要重蹈以前的覆轍罷。</p>

<h3>粵桂最近槪况　粵省的財政</h3>
<p>— 本報記者笑盦</p>
<p>粤局轉變以後、粤省財政狀况、亦從而轉變、蓋州持財政者、首先奉令實行禁賭、同時又裁廢各種苛雜、期與民更始也、查粤省每年收入、稱最大宗者、厥為賭餉與田賦二項、賭餉如番攤舖票等、依二十三四年度之收入計算、共為二千零八十二萬餘元、此次實行禁賭、該項鉅大收入、卽歸於無有矣、關於田賦一項、陳濟棠時代、業已撤銷、改辦土地稅、但該稅以創辦伊始、手續甚繁、民間遵照者、微乎其微、而辦理徵收該稅人員、旣非老練能幹之流、又非深悉田賦情狀人物、故該稅雖已開辦、收入數址、殊無成績可言、墓此兩　、粤省財政、顯露出其困難景象、而財政當局旣圖與民更始、是以裁廢苛雜計劃、又須同時施行、其主持裁廢苛雜者、則為財政廳附設之裁廢苛雜審議委員會、所有應否裁廢之苛雜、悉由該會逐一審查、厘定裁廢步驟、查現已裁廢者、有米穀稅·機器稅·房捐漁業稅·水泥附加稅·佛山戲院附加稅·台山縣灰磚附加稅·連江生猪出口捐·瓊崖生猪出口捐等十餘種、此外尙有待審查後裁廢者、預計裁廢之苛雜、總數常在百萬元以外、查粤省歲出歲入、往年大概數目、歲入為五千四百七十餘萬元、歲出經常臨時各費六千五百二十餘萬元、本來收支已不相抵、此次實行禁賭、每年歲入、顯然短少二千萬元、加以士地稅收入成績不佳、苛雜之陸續廢除、是以財政方面、殊感拮据、財政當局、雖已呈准中央發行公債一萬二千萬元、然其用途、則為整理金融、且公債發行、須經過相當手續、亦未易能救急、宋廳長數度晋謁孔部長、殆與是有關也、微聞省政府前曾奉令修築西北兩江之間公路、以便運輸、關於建築經費、估計的需二百萬元、謀以短時間完成、省府會議、經議决分期建築、第一期准撥五十萬元、着由財政廳照付、但結果則財政廳以十分窘困之故、僅撥付五萬元而已、舉一反三、可見粤省財政、已不如前矣、財政當局在此困難情况下、於是對於開銷方面、力事緊縮、卽如財政廳內部組織、往者共分六科、現改為三科、所有人員、亦略减少、又關於省政府轄下各機關、更厲行裁員减政、並將再請中央於可能範圍內、予以補助、俾財政元氣、早得恢復、大抵必假以長期間、財政前徐方能樂觀也、</p>
<p>大洋制之實行、在粵省財政方面、亦為重要問題之一、綠粤省向為小洋制省份、省內一切商業、悉用小洋、對外貿易、則以香港貨幣為本位、除國稅機關外、工商各界、幾不知有大洋、此次政府宣佈粤省將實行大洋制、各界均甚關切、以各界囊中向無大洋、若以小洋兌換大洋一轉變間、必遭不小的損失、所以當此問題發生之初、商會徵集各界意見、皆主張小洋兌換大洋、不得超過加三、蓋欲希望政府垂念粵省民生過去　所受之摧殘、期於實行大洋制時、損失略小也、但政府最後决定、則為加四·八、此與各界之希望、相距甚遠、且市面時價、每每在加四·九一以外、甚至政府機關如法院郵局及粤漢鐵路等、則竟定為加五、卽每粵幣一百五十元、始能兌換大洋一百元、政府機關、其不遵法令者、一至於是、故各界感受損失上之痛苦、與日俱深、滬粤間之商務、亦遭其影響、目下一般人對於政府所定加四·八率、頗為失望、對於加五收入之政府機關、尤為怨恨、有謂政府指摘粤省毫票基金不足、不得不規定為加四。八、其實粤省內地、白銀仍極多、估計全省白銀、陳濟棠時代所已收集者、不過三分之一、其餘三分之二、如政府積極收集、使充法幣基金、當亦甚為雄厚、又有謂過去毫票之濫發、原是陳濟棠時代辦理的不善、今之實行大洋制、規定小洋加四·八計算、是損失者乃在老百姓、政府在收服人心使擁誕中央之下、亦宜接納商會與各界之加三主張、庶幾益增上下和衷之美、甚有謂粤省毫票、固然是紙、中央大洋票亦屬是紙、在向非大洋制省份之廣東、如欲推行大洋順利、尤宜在原情酌理下、予粤人以不過甚之損失云、凡此持論、雖非根據正確理論、然可見粤人對於大洋制之實行、所懊一般的見解、且顯然存有些微憤意、政府為安定粤省財政計、似不可忽視此問題也、</p>

<p>棉市晨初狂落、且市氣殊挫、午後空方突來抵補、檯面一緊、買者勢如蜂擁、漲勢遂見緊張、但天部份多方業已出檔矣、</p>
<p>檯花　跌午回</p>
<p>標花前午開盤、近日略昂、遠月勿動、一盤平定、距拍三盤、市態急變、據云銀行對於棉花押欵、先行做保兵險、方可承接、於是竇風大熾、十月猛跌七局半、打破九元、遠月跌破四十元關口、查其原因、大半一般獲利多頭出檔也、查恒益·大孚合興·潤康·長和·福康·大批賣出、惟聚興。大豐·橫昌·生源·裕大·購進亦夥、標花結果、各月比上日收盤價均跌三角半至六·七角、午後開盤、市况良好、空頭又來抵補、步步向上、結果各月比上午收盤價均派四角半至六角半、查賣出大豐二千九百　、大孚三千四百擔、恒益五千四百擔、合興五千二百擔、潤康九千八百擔、福康三千三百擔、長和一萬一千四百擔、同和一千八百擔、信誠五千二百擔、買進聚興四千擔、大豐五千一百擔、錦昌三千一百擔、賡豐一萬四千四百擔、愼昌二千五百擔、晋餘二千五百擔、生源二千六百擔、裕大三千九百擔、明德六千擔、源興昌二千六百擔、一日間最高低及收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>英棉市繼續良好</h3>
<p>—美棉受益匪淺—</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、利物浦消息良好、布疋需要繼續暢達、現棉出口進步、脚地較堅、各月泓一至六磅音、其後、多頭了結、套賣增加、南方天氣良好、買戶靜候私家佔計及八日發表之政府報吿、市况回疲、收槃前、同業大批買進、空戶亦有抵補、計現貨漲一磅音、期貨漲一至三磅音、今晚天氣預測、東部一部份有雲雨、大致良好、中部順得、西部一部份有雲、英棉現貨漲九點、期貨漲五至七點、印棉日商大批購買、大陸出口商及布商亦有需要其後、空戶拋賣及多頭了結、市况略回、計平果爾漲半羅比、奧姆辣漲一·二五羅比、白羅溪漲〇·七五羅比、原電錄左、（一日電）</p>

<h3>紗布倉庫存額見减</h3>
<p>華商紗布交易所、倉庫中存紗至最近截止、共計二萬一千八百四十包、其中二十支飛艇·紅奎星·鑫金城·雙鹿·醒獅·三星·計六牌、尚在二千包外至三千一·二·百包之譜、茲將存紗情形如下、（單位元）</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布現貨仍感缺乏</h3>
<p>粤滇川閩添辦不絕　隴海沿路需求轉緩</p>
<p>昨棉布市面、以紗花跌後回漲、布價亦賴以穩定、市上現貨、仍形匱乏、惟隴海沿路各地、聞因路局車輛不敷、各貨綏裝、致現貨需要亦稍見遲緩、售盤依然堅穩、成交不旺、而期貨及棧單派交貨、售盤稍鬆、廠家遠期貨頗有意開售、而市上則少問津、咸傾向吸收現貨、粤·滇·川閩各貨報裝仍盛、　帮盛裝細斜·粗布·及花色貨·直貢·綫呢、川帮裝去以花絨色斜藍布數額最巨、而滇帮除裝直貢嗶嘰定貨外、士林布·大紅絨·印花絨·尺六元絨·粗布·綫呢等貨、亦辦進二百餘件之譜、間　辦胃亦强、以嗶嘰綫呢需要最急</p>
<h3>有西文字套頭呢尤為暢銷</h3>
<p>昨呢羢市銷暢旺、人字呢·馬褲呢·波蘭·衣呢·套頭呢·女色呢等、買方咸有續辦、邊旁有西文字之套頭呢、尤為暢銷、惟申地存貨、則極感缺乏、頭號每碼批售十二三元、普通亦須售八元左右、七元光景者、早被西服業搜羅殆盡、故八元左右之有字套頭呢、竟亦大受歡迎、市氣鋒俏異常、價格逐步昂漲云、</p>
<h3>糧食　標粉午後又見下降</h3>
<p>昨日麵粉上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初疲繼定、後復回跌之象、洋麥報價、芝加哥續小八分、坎拿大漲二角零、故開價時、市氣曾見軟弱、惟自十一月份開始、因業外浮多、以中日問題、暫時緩和買氣又活、各月份較前日好起近分、迨至下午開盤、近期各月份、又見跌風、因謠傳華北局面嚴重、人心又復皇皇、故近期回跌一二分、二三月份、尙見定局、此後情形、當視時局為轉移云、</p>
<h3>期麥交易甚為寂靜</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份大致平定、因洋麥上落無幾、時局前途、又無澄淸之象、故各月份交易、大致停寂、惟因出戶較稀、喊價均提二三分左右、迨至下午開盤、交易更少、因紛市不振、謠言又多、近遠期挫落二三分、後步情形、因時局之變化莫測、交易恐不易發展矣、現麥市面、廠方因一致觀望、進胃不貪、祇交見四五百包、最高仍開三角、中次照降云、</p>
<h3>食米銷活價多上漲</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源共到二十餘號、貨共四千餘石、本銷更見活絡、包胃大連烟台兩帮亦辦　種百哥等新薄稻四百餘包、故在到稀時市况頓現起色、結果若　種百哥行情續升三尺、而厚新粳漲風尤演唱熾、竟騰四角、杜尖亦增一二角、羊尖貨乏較提二三尺不等、且觀後市趨勢、若到源續稀、似有繼　之望、陳變元自前市猝漲後、形勢轉平、價無榮辱、新陰元到貨雖多、去路亦佳、市面定中帶緊之局、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各埠到貨不旺、紙有二十六七號、市上各種去胃因人心震動、去路頗佳、惟變元平淡、市形破粳高貨加一角、中决提昂二三角、新梗加起二三四角不等、陳羊尖價加三四角、新羊杜尖價加二三角、新埠客尖亦漲三四角、窰中加二三角、變千元挺立、嘉善白稻上市、開九元五角二、</p>
<h3>客秈粵帮復起暢辦</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况初疲後漲、市居站局、當晨間開盤時以本客去化均淡、而謠言不絕、人心一致趨下、貨主莫不爭先貶價求脫、行情一度降落二五分至近角不等、價小後突有夸帮復起暢辦、而汕頭與本街辦胃亦香、內地亦略有點綴、交易極旺、粤帮辦去糙米亦有，一萬數千包、汕頭本街亦復暢辦各路機米萬多包、市價立卽回好近角、統市開出江西米六千多包、湘米七千包、漢糙一萬包</p>
<h3>海味　海參來源勉敷需求</h3>
<p>海參各路來源、仍甚稀少、致街貨軋缺、市勢飛俏、遇客路需要、時有無貨供給之憾、故行號售盤、升漲不已、如西洋老港紅底靴參、統市斷檔已久、六支新港冲紅靴、現市高漲一百八十八元、八支一百七十八元、十二四支一百五十元、六八支北海靴一百七十元、八支一百五十五元、十二支鴨墩白靴一百零二元、至九十八元、二三支金山頂烏縐三百十元、四五支二百八十元、六八支望翻錫正路烏元二百四十元、八支二百二十元、十支二百七元、十二支一百九十六元、東津十番參陳貨早通、新貨少到、而以根室路這、尤為缺佾、刻售三十五支價、三百四十五元、四十支三百三十元、五十支三百二十元、六十支三百十元、三十支增卯貨三百四十二元、三十五支三百二十元、四十支三百元、四十五支二百九十五元、五十支二百八十八元、五十五支二百八十四元、六十支二百七十七元、三十二支宗谷貨三百三元、四十五支三百零六元、六十支二百九十八元、七十二支二百七十八元、三十二支細皮八甲參二百七十元、粗皮二百四十二元、百各橋市價、較旬前抬高二三十元、至四五十元不等、且客方願意忍貴採辦、故交易並不見减、據業中人去、茍來貨不旺、則後市尚有繼續上漲之可能、</p>

<h3>絲茶　里昂絲價突見昂騰</h3>
<p>受法郞貶値影響</p>
<p>昨日海外絲市、里昂因法郞貶値後、物價騰漲、日本絲白廠經在法持價、突然升騰一三·五〇法郞、每基羅絲價為八〇法郞、（按前日為六六·五〇法郞）、上海絲AB兩等級及廣東絲因市情紛亂、致皆無行市、橫濱紐約兩埠、則較疲軟、紐的中日生絲持價、除廣東絲維持原盤外、其餘一律跌去一分、交易所售盤、近期跌二分半、據期跌半分、橫濱期貨未動、現貨小二元、本埠絲市依然呆鈍、洋莊用戶均少交易、絲價因之亦趨疲軟、行盤大致回跌十元左右云、</p>
<h3>紐約進口生絲較增</h3>
<p>據路透電、紐約生絲存銷報吿、丸月份因係解貨旺月、故生絲進口數字、較上月為增、然上海絲輸美僅增加八十担、廣東絲則因該時兩粤問題初平、故無輸出、而日絲則較增二千九百五十七担、歐洲意大利等絲計增加六百九十八担、茲將其存銷各項、列表如下、</p>
<h3>針眉綠茶略有走銷</h3>
<p>昨日茶市、依然淸淡、全市僅英莊協和利孚等行、對於路莊平水兩路針眉綠茶、買進五百餘箱、價開二小三四元、至珍眉綠茶、去路異常呆滯、蓋因法郞貶値、國外來價較前大為苛緊、且時局不寗、人心亦因之消極，其餘貢熙珠茶等項、亦均寥落云、</p>
<p>又據茶棧業公會報吿云、綠茶市秋節後依然無進展、各洋行因法郞貶値、復以為對市價頗有進出、但以買方無相當來電、亦無表示、僅以低莊貢珠秀眉等略有交易而已、市面仍有暫行停頓之勢云、</p>
<h3>糖市　荷粗白現貨升一角</h3>
<p>昨糖市仍堅、但以時局關係、交易不免見减、公會劃盤、二四粗砂白現貨呌升一角、為二十一元七角半、轉口高貨呌六元半、普通六元四角、東白現貨升角許、四號二十一元六角、八號二十一元三角、餘乏上落、本廠綿白振記大華金心一號均二十元半、號貨僅廣帮開出祝靑一百數十包、十三元二角、</p>
<p>合組公司昨為本週第三次標兌粤糖之期、計總定額為七、二三四包、標價如前、當售出順德廠五羊粗白一百包、二十一元半、市新廠又廠二百包、二十一元三角、汕頭廠又高莊五百包、二十一元二角、次之二十一元一角、成交一百包、二十元九角、成交二百五十包、共計成交一千一百五十包、</p>
<h3>五金　花園鉛絲搜羅甚殷</h3>
<p>花園鉛絲（卽俗稱鐵絲網）、最近交易大為活潑、查前昨兩日、市上開出達四五千扎之多、惟市貨自經收辦之後、卽吿斷檔、標準飛漲、最初行情每扎售一元二角半、其後陸續加起至四元一二角不等、最後且升至四元五角、</p>
<p>新鉛絲生意亦甚良好、如十一號十四號十六號等花色市上流通貨、亦有搜羅殆盡之勢、行情比前各好起五六角不一、其餘花色、因實銷不多、故市價尙無變化云、</p>
<h3>雜訉　三柰汕市升四元許</h3>
<p>汕頭電訊、三柰因貨缺、產價跳升四元數角、此間號貨查已不多、因亦隨緊、後市有步升之象、</p>
<h3>介紹新著「典當論」</h3>
<p>—宓公幹著—</p>
<p>典當是「窮人的後門，」在這種社會情形下，一日三餐，　飱不繼的時候，「磚頭無處討火，」如其有些破東西，尙可向典當乞貸，勉度一餐，所以典當在目前窮人還沒有得到相當代替組織以前，他的地位是不可輕視的。</p>
<p>不過，典當的制度，經過經濟恐慌潮流的激盪，農村破產嚴重的影響，「岌岌乎危哉。」何况典當朝奉，終日價坐在當內，最是守舊不過。所以要維持他的營業，祇有改良之一途。因此我對於宓公幹先生所著的「典當論，」表示深切之同意。蓋不經過一番調查研究，那能編得成好方案。惟有此監本，典當業遂有改革之希望，故燊為介紹。　編者</p>

<h3>市公安局不吿　市民切弗信謠遷居　虹口閘北情勢昨復緩和　北四川路鐵絲網已撤去</h3>
<p>新聲社云、虹口閘北一帶、昨日情勢、復趨和緩、北四川路各要道口、日軍鐵絲網已撤去、江灣路同濟路等處、日軍崗位隨派隨撤、惟越界築路以東、天潼路香烟橋一帶、仍感不安、市公安局特於各馬路張貼布吿安民、勸阻遷移、茲分誌詳情如次、</p>
<p>鐵絲網已撤</p>
<p>日軍自前日淸晨起、在北四川路與老靶子路·海寗路·崑山路·蓬路·武昌路·天潼路·等各要道口、架設鐵絲網、並擴展崗位巡邏至蘇州路蘇州河畔、現該項鐵絲網、已於昨日淸晨、完全撤去、惟所布崗位及散兵或整隊車輛梭巡、則仍達蘇州河畔、但為數似較前日稍减、蓬路日本人俱樂部、昨僅留卡車一輛、崗位一名、</p>
<p>發現三駐所</p>
<p>租界方面日陸戰隊分防所、前僅知北四川路·邢家橋堍·永豐大樓·及其美路口·狄思威路五零四號洋房兩處、新聲社記者昨又發現三處、一在湯恩路口斐倫路六九九號·一在閔行路北密勒路四〇〇號·另一在密勒路南段八三號·門前均各駐鐵甲車、軍用卡車、機器脚踏車、及軍官用汽車一二輛不定、虹口東部與狄思威路越界築路毘連地段、日軍出巡、似以此三分防所為中心、</p>
<p>江灣路尚安</p>
<p>至於閘北方面、江灣路一帶、尙稱安謐、僅鐵路以南虹口公園附折越界築路地段、有日軍常川崗位數名、此外同濟路。江灣路口。及恒業路等處、日軍雖亦曾派崗、但隨派隨撤、仍如前日、分為三次、計晨七時至八時半、午十一時至十二時半、下午二時半至四時許、共餘時間均撤去、惟不時仍有五六人八九人一隊、分至各處梭巡、六三花園後面花園街底曠塲灘屋造酒廠日軍、除向上述各處派出崗巡外、無特殊舉動、八字橋稍南日本墓地、仍有三五名留守、甚為沉寂、</p>
<p>香烟橋較緊</p>
<p>惟閘北東部自歐陽路祥德路口起、南至其美路狄思威路口、東至天潼路天潼路橋·及老香烟橋路香烟橋、又東體育會路·及其美路一帶、仍滿佈日軍崗位、迄晚未撤、散兵及整隊車輛梭巡、往來甚繁、故該方面情形、較為緊張、前日曾有多數居民、向租界遷移、自市公安局布告勸阻、昨日已較鎭靜、但北四川路一帶、由北朝南車輛、仍頗多載運行李傢具者、入晚尤甚、</p>
<p>公安局布吿</p>

<p>主文</p>
<p>楊文道·葉海生·共同殺人、各處死刑、各褫奪公權終身、手槍一支、子彈六粒、彈壳一枚、子彈頭一粒、藏槍書一本、均沒收、周社榮無罪、</p>
<p>事實</p>
<p>綠楊文道係前洪順互助會主席、葉海生又名小廣東、係該會會員、向有斧頭黨之稱、民國廿二年十一月間、楊文道因事離滬、其所主持之洪順互助會、亦隨之瓦解、民國廿三年十一月、楊文道返滬後、又與葉海生等組織同仁·同義·兩協會、均以楊文道為主席、葉海生則兼</p>
<p>兩會會員但人數不多、其勢力比之洪順互助會、不逮遠甚、廿四年十月底、楊文道·葉海生·等密謀狙擊日本軍官或兵士、希圖惹起騷動、乘機在虹口一帶擴充勢力、計定後、卽於同年十一月三日下午三時、先往竇樂安路視察地點、並於五日晚間、在靶子路永吉里七十一號同義協會內以紙捲拈鬮定為何人實施、葉海生</p>
<p>拈得去字、遂於同月九日下午八時餘、先由楊文道交付葉海生手槍一技、葉海生得槍後、遂在竇樂安路口等候、將近九時、見一日本水兵（卽中山秀雄）在該處行走、葉海生卽跟隨該水兵之後、行至竇樂安路豐樂里口附近、（時已九時）從旁用槍向水兵頭部開放、水兵應聲倒地、越時身死、葉海生於開槍後、卽逃入豐樂里、並將手槍（卽一四一一四四六號）棄於看弄人之</p>
<p>空木亭下、逃回月宮飯店、本年四月間、被捕房發覺、先派員至靑島將葉海生提案、同月十九日、在上海塘山路同安里十八號將楊文道逮捕、並在其臥室內、搜獲挖洞藏槍之綠色實用物理學一本、連同涉有嫌疑之周社榮、先後解案起訴、</p>
<p>理由</p>
<p>查已死日本水兵中山秀雄、於民國廿四年十一月九日下午九時、在寳樂安路豐樂里口、被槍擊身死、當時之創傷狀况、其頭部後頭結節、由中央右斜上方七公分、由右外聽道後上方六公分之部位、認有直徑〇·七公分之正圓形射入口動脈性、出血多量、同在前頭部略在中央、直徑的二公分有不正形之射出口、其周圍頭蓋粉碎骨折著明膨隆腦漿、一部有由</p>
<p>創口露出有多量動脈性出血、呈極重篤症狀、死因腦損傷及腦出血死亡、十月一按係十一月之誤）十日午前一時十分、經日本軍醫中佐小川恂吉騐明、塡有診斷書為設、並據嘉興路捕房日副捕頭開伊雅索（譯音）報吿、於去年十一月允日下午十一時四十分、在豐樂里弄堂內看弄人木亭下尋到手槍一枝、（按卽二四一一四六號子彈六粒、狄思威路捕房第六一號日捕報吿、於去年十一月九日下午九時</p>
<p>出事之後在該處一灘血漬、南的八尺、找得一顆子彈、同捕房第五一號日探報吿去年十一月九日下午十點多鐘、我在竇樂安路出事地點、找到彈充一顆、又據工部局警務處槍械間西探目卡雷（譯音）報吿、去年十一月十日上午十二時一刻有、枝一槍（按卽二四一一四六號）交我檢騐、騐得該手槍機件完好、是新近打過、還有一個彈壳和一顆子彈、（按卽日捕第六一號日探第五號在出事地點尋獲之物、）</p>
<p>交我檢驗經我認定交來的子彈與彈壳、均係由這枝槍發出去的等語、並經捕房將是項手槍子彈彈壳呈案為證、足見呈案槍彈、卽為殺死中山秀雄之兇器、已屬毫無疑義、茲應究明者、卽被吿等是吾為殺人兇犯是已、據葉海生在捕房及本院供述略稱、廿四年十月底、在同義協會、楊文道說我想打死一日本官長或兵、虹口一定大亂、我們可以借偭機會、擴充虹口</p>
<p>一帶勢力那時我們大家都有好處了、但我們行事之期、要先去看地點、到十一月三日下午三時、我們一直向北、行至竇樂路轉　向西、後由北直出虹口公園、後乘電車回家、到五號晚九時半、我們在會內（卽永吉里七十一號）、文道預備紙捲、是三角形內有一個去字的、我拏了一只、打開一看、內有一個去字、文道說好了、我們到九號晚行事、九號晚八時餘、文道交手槍與我、呌我到竇樂安路口等候、我等了半個多鐘頭、見</p>
<p>日本水兵在前行、我就眼他向竇樂安路、行至豐樂里附近、我就用槍向他頭上開放、後向豐樂里逃走、手槍棄在一亭子之下、又稱曾由文道敎我開放手槍、那時文道敎我開槍目的、是預備與太古碼頭三十六個黨對敵、那時我在太古一號棧房、看見手槍四五枝、但與槍殺日本水兵之槍不同等語、於實施殺人各情、言之歷歷如繪、並經本院受命推事前往出事地點·及月宮飯店·與永吉里七十一號同義協會·舊址</p>
<p>事實勘驗葉海生復將前所供述如何謀議、如何查看地點、如何跟隨水兵開槍、及如何棄槍逃走各情、在受命推事前一一自白無異、此有勘騐筆錄及附圖足資證明、核與證人胡祥和所述聽見槍響後、見一穿黑色衣服者由路中逃入豐樂里、證人潘巧美所述是晚由竇樂安路向南行走、行至第一九一號、看見一日本水兵與一穿黑色西裝人分東西向北前行、旋卽</p>
<p>聽見槍聲見水兵倒地、西裝人不見等語、亦相符合、並經捕房在靑島搜獲葉海生之黑色西裝一套、訊據葉海生供認、去年十一月九日前後、確係穿此西裝、足見其自白與事實吻合、且查該被吿　有斧頭黨之稱、（見淞滬警備司令部案卷）其所述殺人事實、允堪認定、雖其自白中有在水兵背後（距離五六常步）開槍之語、與法醫研究所推算之角度及子彈、在血漬後發見之事實、</p>
<p>似有出入但據潘巧英證明日本水兵在西邊、穿黑色西裝人在東邊、均係向北行走、伊從兩人中間穿過、而豐樂里又在路東、足見兇手常時是在東邊開槍、由水兵側旁打去、並非在背後開槍、此與小川恂吉所具診斷竇及胡祥和所稱見兇手在路中間向豐樂里逃跑之語、（見勘圖）均屬相符、則葉海生所稱在背後在槍一點、自不足採、至子彈在</p>
<p>屍身背後發見一層、據西副探長克勞德報吿、當時到塲的人、計有百餘子彈、恐係被人踢至南面屍身背後去的、證以彈壳所落的地方、恰與拾得子彈的地方是一平綫、（見勘圖）亦自近情合理、不足為異、雖胡祥和初在捕房供述逃走的人係一水兵、但質之潘巧英、則稱逃走的人係穿黑色西裝、查胡祥和距離逃走者的有八十四尺、且燈光不甚明亮、而潘巧英則曾與逃走者擦肩而過、其觀察自較明確、要以潘</p>
<p>巧英證言更為可信、再查葉海生之供詞、雖前後未盡一致、但經本院於第三次審理時、特別曉以利害、將來不可翻悔、據其聲明、这次說的絕對不悔、經提與楊文道對質、該被告復轉對楊文道說、十一月三日到虹口公園去看地點回來、到五日拿紙頭、我拿得一個去字云云、亦屬毫無隱匿、常履勘時、據胡祥和稱、看見逃的人、由電綫木柱後折入豐樂出、葉海生隨即糾正係直人　樂里、並未</p>
<p>穿過電綫木柱、並謂我打死了人、當然從寬處跑、不會從那窄處跑、於逃跑情形、允復言之鑿鑿、其為殺人正犯、益屬無疑、詎於本年五月二十七日第四次審判時、忽翻前供、否認有殺人之事、並謂前此自白、係出刑求、在捕房曾呑有西裝扣鈕及兩把鑰匙、可以剖騐云云、但經本院命法醫檢騐、據其報吿略稱、葉海生現年二十八歲、在工部局醫院會同其醫生檢騐、自稱所呑鑰匙銅鈕、經</p>
<p>用X光照其腸部、未見五金物件、可證明當時腸中幷無呑物存在、又據其自稱兩邊肋部感痛苦、左邊較重、非屬毆打所致、似係軟物摩擦騐、係在第六七八肋骨部份、但外表絕無破損痕跡、與四圍之皮一樣、左鼻孔下上唇皮現一疤痕一公分長、半正分寬、長圓形性軟甚整齊、中間粉紅、顯白紋、其組織係曾脫皮現象、尙未出二三星期、法醫魏立功五月二十八日有騐單附卷、固不能證明該被吿</p>
<p>確會受刑况據該被吿供述受刑、係在改期兩星期以後、查改期兩星期、為五月六日、該被吿在五月六日以前、卽已自白殺死日本水兵屬實、其為藉詞翻供、允屬灼然、至被吿楊文道對於前為洪順互助會主席、民國廿二年十一月離滬後、該會旋卽瓦解、嗣於廿三年十一月回滬、另組同仁·同義·兩協會、幷為該兩會主席、會員不多、各情均不否認、雖不承認有</p>
<p>共同謀殺日本水兵之事實、然查共同被吿不利於己之供述、得採為其他共犯犯罪之證據、歷經最高法院著有判例、本件據葉海生所述、楊文道於謀議殺人、均經參與、其用以殺人之手槍、且係該被吿所交付、幷查有手槍為證、則其共犯責任、已非空言所能狡卸、况經捕房於本年四月十九日在塘山路同安里十八號該被告家中臥室內、搜得綠色實用物理學書一本、書中</p>
<p>挖有一洞為藏置手槍之用、常西副探長克勞德取得該書後、幷未發問、該被吿卽稱該書係其所有、此有西副探長之報吿可核、幷經本院將該書曁二四一一四六號手槍交法醫硏究所檢查、據其說明書略稱、查該書自第十六頁以後至三八三頁之各頁中、挖有手槍形空洞長的一五·六公分、寬約一一·二公分、深的二·二公分、第十六頁中沾染有藍色鉛筆盡就之槍形印痕、幷附有黃褐色</p>
<p>銹斑三處在左側者呈橫形綫條　、中部為弧形、右側者有少許之點狀銹斑及橫形綫樣壓痕、查該痕跡與手槍（卽一四一一四六號）上相常部之紋路長　距離遠近、均能符合、（法醫硏究所檢字第九十九號說明書參照、）幷據工部局指印間職員潘相逖克遜（譯音）報告略稱、這本藏手槍的書、（即綠色實用物理學）兩面都印有這枝PB手槍（即二四一一四六號）的痕跡、均經</p>
<p>拍有照片如槍柄上圈和圈內的PB兩英文字、以及槍上的保險機紐和螺絲釘頭、並槍柄上凸起一條一條紋·都印有很顯明的痕跡、再者書上還染有黃的顏色、正是槍上生的鐵銹、此外就是書內所印有痕跡的距離、恰恰和這枝PB手槍的大小相同、（見五月一日筆錄）又稱上次到庭作證回去後、又用顯微鏡去放大、照片共有三張、第一張是槍膛後段所起楞紋、印在書頁上的情形、第二張是手槍上</p>
<p>螺絲釘印在書頁上的痕跡、第三張是槍柄上PB兩英文字印在書頁上的痕跡、還有該項手梭、因為收藏不好、生了有銹粘在書上的銹跡、本人於拍照之後、用儀器比較、畫成紅圈、將相同之點（指書內銹跡與手槍銹跡）一齊標明、共有四十一點之多、本人可以斷言、這本書內所挖的洞是藏這枝手槍用的云云、並呈有放大照片三張為證、經本院發交</p>
<p>法醫研究所覆騐、其見解亦屬相同、而該項綠色實用物理學書一本、係該被吿所有、並用以藏置手槍等情、又據該被吿於本年四月二十日在本院承認無異、現旣證明該綠色實用物理學書內所藏之槍、卽係殺死日本水兵中山秀雄之兇器、則葉海生所稱殺人的手槍、由楊文道交付一語、益屬信而有微、雖據楊文道辯稱、我的槍係向公安局領的、這本書係藏所領公安局手槍之用、該槍已還公安局了、經</p>

<h3>奇裝異服和婦女們</h3>
<p>— 諸膝曼蓉</p>
<p>奇裝異服，這四個字，顧名思意，當然不會美觀了；非但不美觀，並且有時再會攸傷風化。於是有好些地方，都是很嚴厲地取締的，像魯省的韓主席，他還親自拘捕這些奇裝異服的人。</p>
<p>奇裝異服，似乎無分性別，不過你可不必細問，這是完全指我們女子說的。我曾看見過很多的婦女們，都喜歡作奇裝，穿異服，伊們以為這樣的超前裝束，才可表示出十足的摩登，和十分的不美觀；然而，這是根本的錯誤了！</p>
<p>愛美心，本來人人都有的，不過需要認清這「美」的真意，否則就容易「欲美反醜」，要美觀反而形成了醜態，那又何必摩登呢？</p>
<p>我曾看見過很多的婦女們，伊們的小膀上，腳踝上，印上了黑黑地累累的凍瘃疤，然而，伊們還不以為醜惡，也學時髦地赤了腳，穿了留空的高跟鞋，試問，像這種形態，難道也算美觀的嗎？還有骨瘦嶙峋的人們，二隻大臂瘦得幾乎沒有一絲肌肉，然而，伊還穿了沒有袖子的旗袍，試問，像這種形態，也算是美觀的嗎！卽使你皮膚上絕對沒有斑疤，大臂上的肌肉且特別的豐腴，那嗎穿了奇裝異服，也並不見得有什麼美觀，至多被人稱一聲「嬌艷」而已！你想合算嗎？</p>
<p>老實說，一個女子的美醜，是天生成的，並不是穿了奇裝異服就能變醜為美的，你只要看西施，起先是苧蘿村姑，伊並不打扮，然而徧徧特別的美麗，否則范蠡怎會看見了伊就很合意地把伊獻給吳王呢？</p>
<p>有人說，這種奇裝異服，不是我們自己發明的，大半是效學歐化，那麼歐西尚且通行，我國有什麼妨礙？這話表面上似乎有些對，其實錯了，古人說：「習其所長，去其所短，」那麼原是要敎我們效學他人的長處，而不要效學他人的短處的呀！</p>
<p>現在我們正在竭力地高喊着「男女平等」，「不作男子的玩物」，這當然是我們婦女界的好現象；不過，一方面我們自己也得特別地留意，一切需要我們自己先尊重着自己，然後別人也會尊重我們，否則憑你呼聲高，恐怕也只能永遠做了他們男子的玩物！喜穿奇裝異服的姊妹們！你們真在自暴自棄！快些覺悟吧！不要再自己輕視自己了！</p>
<h3>已婚婦女的通病</h3>
<p>— 震亞</p>
<p>世上無論什麼科學家，文學家，音樂家等總是男子佔絕對的多數，很難得有女子佔一席地位的，這是什麼緣故呢？是女子的天才不及男子麼？不是，我以為不一定。退一步說，假使女子的天才是不及男子的話，這也不足以為藉口，因為事業的成就並不一定全靠天才，三分天才，七分努力，是一般人所公認的話，並且確實有人經騐過。</p>
<p>由此可知，女子可以很少有人成就大的事業，成什麼科學家，文學家，音樂家等，主要的原因乃是她們不能努力發揮她們的天才，而這個致命傷我們敢斷定，卽是結婚。然而這並非是絕對的，一個女子若能在婚後打破這層難關，不犯這種通病，那麼結婚於她並不見得有害，抑且於她有益，如果她的丈夫能幫助她的話。可惜許多女子，或可說一般的女子都犯了這種通病。</p>
<p>這種通病是什麼呢？</p>
<p>原來一般女子在結婚以後，她以為她的目的或說慾望已經達到，她已得了一個丈夫，一個依靠者，一個供給她生活的人，從此她可不必再奮鬥上進，她已離了社會進了家庭，她對國家是等於一架生育小國民的機械，對家庭祗是一個賢妻良母，對於自己已是換了一個人生——由童女變成了一個主婦，所以對於婚前所努力的，所奮鬥的幾乎是棄若敝屣了。因而一個好文學的女子在婚後竟會幾年不摸一本書，一個善於彈鋼琴的女子在婚後不到幾年的功夫幾乎連琴譜也不識了，諸如此類的事實筆者曾見到不少，閱者試想一個無論怎樣有天才的女子那能在如此境況中有進步呢？無怪才乎在歷史上無論那種事業成功的女子總比男子少得多了！</p>
<p>當然嚕！文學家，音樂家，科學家等不是每一個男子都能做得到的，但每一個男子都得以這類人做他奮鬥上進的正鵠。筆者也不提但每一個女子都去做一個專家，但至少的限度，每一個女子在婚後都當奮鬥，再求上進，決不可把結婚當作一個墳墓，拿婚前所學的一切都埋葬在內，而另外過一個新的瞌睡生活。若然每一個女子都以為結婚後她便無須再求上進，而把婚前所學習的一切聽其荒蕪，那麼不若不學來得好！</p>
<p>最後，話也得顧到二方面，許多女子在婚前確是預算得很好，想在婚後每天抽出來幾小時讀書看報，但一到了夫家，卻出於意料之外，家事鎖屑，忙得不堪，對於婚前所打算的自修祗得作罷，心有餘而力不足，徒喚奈何而已。這種同病者，確實很多，但希望她們待將來把家務處置得有條不紊，足資應付時，不要忘了以前所打算而不能辦到的自修！</p>
<p>讓我再說一句當作本文的結束，每一個女子在婚後不當停止她的前進，雖然家務很忙，也得忙裏偷閒的去求上進！</p>
<h3>賣花女</h3>
<p>— 綺鳳</p>
<p>街頭女職業之一</p>
<p>我們跑上街去，　目的可以看到許多勞働的女性。伊們在做着各種各樣的工作，真切地直接為社會服務着。反顧我們，那是多麼慚愧呢？現在讓我先介紹一種街頭的女職業者，所謂有着「雅相」的賣花女：</p>
<p>賣花女，伊們不像一般縫紉婦那麼苦悶，也不像一般小販子那麼弄到骯髒。伊們是帶着一些布爾喬亞身上面所有的氣味，但是伊們卻是一個完全的苦女人啊！</p>
<p>無疑地，伊們是帶着鮮花賣給人家的。這可見伊們是把幸福賣給人家了。</p>
<p>賣花的姊妹們，伊們每天和太陽一同上街頭，膽小地拉長了伊們的嗓子喊着花名，旣想招來一些顧客，好讓伊們買硬燒餅來塞滿肚子；可是又怕喊醒了少爺小姐們的美夢。</p>
<p>「賣花吶」！伊們這樣子喊着，接着又喊出了一連串的花名。</p>
<h3>一位中國太太的自述</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>近見美國費拉特爾費亞婦女生活俱樂部，所出版的一冊季刋中，刋着一篇「一位中國太太的自述」，但覺有趣，亟為譯出。這位自述的筆者，據她的自述，姓梁，名明玉，（譯音），但是自從嫁給了一位美國人後，便成了梅·羅森非而特夫人了。「梅·羅森非而特，」是她丈夫的姓氏，「梅」算，算是她的芳名。她今年是三十二歲。她的出身，卻是很可憐的。她是出生在怎裏的？她的父母，是誰？這些，都已是在她的記憶之外了。她的最先的一葉記憶，是在香港的一個公館中，當奴隸制度之下的婢女。主人，是在一個船公司裏任職的。她的主母，是主人的四個姨太太中的一個，待她的惡劣，正和一般的主人，待遇奴隸，沒有甚麼分別。那是在一五一七年前的事，那時她還只十二三歲呢。但是，那時，雖然還只十二三歲，她卻已度着五六年的奴隸生活了。</p>
<p>就在一九一七年那年，她的主人的美籍同事羅森非而特氏，時常上她主人家來閒談，有時，還要求她的主母，做幾色中國菜給她吃。那時，因為見她是那麼的活潑，於是要求着主人，把她賣給他。蒙主人的情，倒很慷慨的不取代價，而奉送着，同時，並還把她算作了他主人的養女。當時，她頗為其他的同伴們所艷羨着她的幸運。但是，在事實上，她的幸運，尚不止此，因為她自被主人贈給了羅森非而特氏之後，便被立卽送入一個女學校裏去念書。一九三二年，羅森非而特，被調到了新加坡。一九二五年，羅森非而特，被調到印度，她也跟着到印度。就在印度，她是在一個宗敎儀式之下，變成了羅森非而特夫人了。那時，她是二十一歲。從結婚那時起，她使中止了讀書，而開始度着家庭生活。</p>
<p>結婚之後的六七年中，她曾跟着丈夫，旅居過紐西蘭，匪列濱，上海，天津等地。一九三二年，因為她的丈夫回美，而別圖發展，於是他們的家庭，便卜居在費拉特爾費亞。雖然在初到美國時，曾一度的引起了鄰居們的驚異，但是不上一年，她是不再被人注意，反而被譽為是「東方型的美國婦人了」。有不少的鄰居親友們，在這在碧眼中，不住的向她問長問短，問着中國的一切。雖然他們聽着中國的一切，宛如在聽着新奇的故事，但是他們雖然隔了些時，又聽她重復的說着，還是像聽着新奇的故事。有些美國太太們，還時常的請她代做着中國菜，並求她敎着用筷進食的方法。她曾在紐約，住過五星期餘，並曾在去年夏間，避暑於舊金山的海濱。因為她是一個東方型的西文婦人，所到處都很受人歡迎。更因為她的丈夫，也是具有着相當地位的，（現任費城某公司船舶部主任，兼別一家公司的進出口經理，）所以她也有着不少知名人物，和　太太們，在她的日記簿上，留下着電話和通信處。</p>
<p>她現在已是二個女兒，和一個兒子的母親了，最大的是九歲餘，最小的，還只二歲稍弱，所以她是一天到晚的忙着管理子女與家務。她說，這是她的天職。這種天職，不拘在西方，或是在中國，是一樣的，因為家庭中的愉快的構成分子，把家中一切不屑之事，整理得有條不紊，是佔着一個絕對的大部份的。</p>
<h3>婚後的我</h3>
<p>— 純娟</p>
<p>—自主婦至做小母親—</p>
<p>「自己還像小孩子一樣，卻做了小孩子的母親了」母親在一面撫模着寶貝的頭，又是怪愛憐，又不勝滄桑之感地說。</p>
<p>是的，自己雖然是個十個月的小孩子的母親了，但仍懂不得事，卻和小孩子一樣。結婚後整整地二年了，從學校裏畢業後，就被愛神拖上了結婚的緋色大道。</p>
<p>結婚後，也曾做了年半左右的小學敎員，但是腹中的小寶貝，卻起了騷動，不得已，只能夠在家裏學做主婦了。卻想不到腹的中寶貝，是個實踐的復古家，不是嗎？他把我從社會上拖回家中，準備做賢妻良母了。</p>
<p>一個像脫韁野馬我，突然間被關住在家裏學做主婦，多少是件不大習慣的事。況且家事又是瑣碎的，忙了一個整天，還是說不出忙些什麼事，實在使我有應付不下之勢。雖然我在自己家裏時，也曾幫助慈母烹煮菜飯，可是，那時不負責任的助理員，現在卻是獨當一面的全權大使了。</p>
<p>責任已負責在肩上，事實放在眼前，一切有的份內的事，你不做，也要去做。不管賬也得去管，於是不慣也只慣了，所以我漸漸的慣了，整天的不出多，老是在家料理油鹽醬醋柴米茶，並且我漸漸感覺到生出興趣來，自動的為家庭而策劃，計數，整理，一切安定了。</p>
<p>這時腹中的小寶貝，也在努力的生長，他竟把我的注意力集中了，替他裁製小衣裳，小鞋子，尿布，慈母早把外孩的小衣服送了來催生，可是我嫌他太舊式了，太龐大，你想又長又大的和尚袈裟似的斜襟衣裳，呌小巧的嬰孩穿了，把他天真活潑的嬌態全都泯滅了，並且障礙了他好動的天性，也不很衛生。所以我就自己裁樣子，做成像洋娃娃式子的小巧衣服，</p>
<p>因為是初次生產，所以比較困難得多，整整的痛了二日二夜，急得慈母焚香念佛，更急得寶貝的爸爸打轉。終於在一個嚴寒的早晨，生下了寶貝，那個雪白粉嫩的小寶貝。這次生產，給我身子上無限的苦楚，人是消瘦得多了，更孱弱了，衰老了。但母親的愛是偉大的，消滅了一切身體上的苦楚，我仍用全力愛護着我的小寶貝</p>
<p>為了嬰孩的健康和智慧，不願把孩子交給無知的乳母，而自己哺乳。這對於我，因生產而失去康健的身體，一個很大的傷害。可是為了做小母親的責任，為了自己的寶貝幸福，我終於忍受了一切的辛苦。</p>
<p>但是初次做母親的我，對於一切都覺得生疏而困難，你想，抱起一個軟綿綿的小身體，給他哺乳，替他換尿布，換襁褓，替他洗澡，這許多件事是多麼吃力的事啊！因為他是這樣的柔弱，這樣的嬌嫩，你一個不小心，就要就他弄痛。還有。一夜醒過來三五次的哺乳，對於我的睡眠，有很大的損失。現在我的小寶貝已有八個多月哩，生得白白胖胖非常的可愛，臉蛋也非常俊秀，像他爸爸一樣，並且怪聰明伶俐。他會咿咿唔唔的說話，只有他自己懂得的話。他有時高興起來，會唱得自成曲調的歌；他會做花眼睛；二只手指做雞之　；有時揑緊了小拳頭做開火砲；他在床上爬得很快，而且氣力也很大；整天到晚的玩，哭的時候真少有，確是整日的笑嘻嘻。</p>
<p>無論是詮，看見了我的寶貝，都說他可愛。但你們也知道，一個可愛的小孩子，全仗父母的養育得好，好像一朶鮮明可愛的花，是人家細心地的栽培的結果。現在我把孩子可愛的寫些出來，給讀者們討論，因為我雖然有一個可愛的寶貝，但是一個缺少經騐的母親，仍需要多方面的指敎。（未完）</p>

<h3>鹹水妹攷</h3>
<p>— （陳天賜）</p>
<p>上海的妓女中，有一種專接外國人，呌做「鹹水妹」的，我想一定有很多人，不知這名詞的來歷。</p>
<p>據說鹹水妹的發源地是香港：當香港割歸英國闢為商埠後，外國人漸漸的上岸經商。其中一班兵艦上的水手，終日無所事事，便靜極思動，要找尋妓女尋歡作樂。可是我國的那些妓女，因為見他們生的相貌，和我們異樣，都是黃頭髮，藍眼睛，很覺得害怕，所以誰也不敢接近他們。只有在海面上那些搖舢舨船擺渡的女子，伊們時常渡外國人上下輪船的緣故，都看慣了，言語也慢慢地互相能通達，那班外國人乃和伊們兜搭起來，伊們自後也就以此為業了。</p>
<p>香港本是一個海島，海水是鹹的，伊們又都在海面做生意，所以呌伊們「鹹水妹」！——以後便成了接洋人的妓女的通稱。這個「妹」是廣東俗語，作女子未曾出嫁之稱，又可作婢女解。現在往往有許多人，凡是廣東妓女，都呌伊們做「鹹水妹」，那是錯的。</p>

<h3>簡便而有效的健美法</h3>
<p>— 正明</p>
<p>真正愛美的女子，她所需要的是健美的體態，決不是用胭脂香粉和口紅告成了姿容，因此她所求的也決不是入口幾十萬的化妝品，而是衛生的方法和健美的運動用具。</p>
<p>健美是每個女子所想佔有的，但是一個完美的健身房或是運動用具，卻不是每個人都能佔有的。因此，一種簡單而有效的健美方法，的確是被大家所在想望着的了。</p>
<p>事實上，要使身體健美，食有定時，睡眠充足，不是不夠的事，一定再要加上一件運動習慣，才能完成我們健美的目的。每天雖有按時的運動，那末你的肌肉便會堅實而健美，成為一個自然的而不是人為的美麗典型了。</p>
<p>前面已經說過健身房和運動器具，不是個個人都能有的，這裏有一個人人可行的健美方法，可以介紹出來。揀一隻長十八英寸的空箱或是一條同樣長的狹凳，如果家裏有鋼琴的坐椅亦可取來一用，將背部平睡在上面，將雙臂筆直地舉過頭上，然後很緩慢的直着仰往後面去。這樣的連運動十次，每次速度可以遞加地增快起來。再運動十次，不過在這第二回的運動時，手臂仰往後去的當兒，需要另換一個姿勢，就是將手臂直着旋轉成一個圓圈的樣子仰向後去。</p>
<p>這樣的做過了以後，你的雙臂仍舊平直的舉着，先將一隻手臂緩緩地垂向後去，然後再將另一隻手臂照樣的做着。開始的五天內一直可以連做十次，其次的三天內可增至十次，以後每天增加五次，這兒最需要注意的，便是你必須要將次數增加上去，減少和間斷是絕對不興的，因為那成功的秘訣是完全包含在這進程裏面啊：</p>
<p>這一個方法，是好萊塢的一位頗有聲名而且前途極有希望的女明星所發明的，她以健美著稱儕輩，同伴學了伊的方法，因此而獲得健美的不一而足，並且日漸流行於普通的婦女社會之間，大家公認是一種簡便而有效的健美方法</p>
<p>要想獲得健美的婦女們！不妨努力一試。</p>
<h3>闊別十年的大姊（下）</h3>
<p>— 李守真</p>
<p>我回到上海之後，第一件事就是去找蘋，當我按照着大姊給我的地址找去時，那裏是一座小小的洋房，樣子倒也相當的精緻，進門去，正有一個年約三歲的小孩子坐在小馬車上玩笑嘻嘻地怪有趣的，我一看就猜到是蘋的孩子了，就問他「寶寶！媽媽呢？」孩子看着我睜大了眼睛，蘋卻聽見了連忙從後面跑了出來一看是我，她是意外的驚喜，而我當然也是無限的安慰的。</p>
<p>我們談着舊日的生活，訴着別後的情形以及彼此最近的情形，她埋怨我不給她信，我說她自己斷了消息，我們又像孩子般的吵，做一堆最後她問到我為什麼知道她的住址，才記起了她的大姊，一談到大姊她的話頭就不再起勁了，結果她還是告訴了我關於大姊所以這樣憔悴的原因。</p>
<p>大姊自從結婚之後，就和姊夫一同到了上海，姊夫在某機關任職，而大姊也就在某私立小學找到了個位置，兩口子的小家庭，過得倒也滿意，那知不到半年，姊夫就另外愛上了某女中的一個學生，在以前，凡是星期或休息日，姊夫總是和大姊一同出去看戲或野外旅行的，以後姊夫卻總是藉故有事一有空閒就向外跑了，而素性柔和的大姊，卻還以為姊夫朋友多應酬忙，而從來沒有責他一句的。</p>
<p>第二年大姊養了第一個孩子，於是他就呌大姊闢了敎職，在家裏養育孩子，他自己卻更是借故的天天不在家了，第三年的春天大姊養第二個孩子，還只七天，姊夫就一個人跑出去旅行去了，當姊夫出門後的第三天，就有一個中年女人跑到大姊家來，說是姊夫帶着她的女兒出去玩了，到現在還沒有回來，她非常的不放心，這樣大姊才明白姊夫的行動，一方面好好的安慰這女人，一方面自己是痛苦萬分，剛剛產後的身體，不能支持，當晚就發熱了，等到姊夫玩得個興盡而歸時，大姊幾乎是只剩了一口氣，後來醫治了幾個月，才脫了險境，而體格卻從此就再也不能恢復了，以後，姊夫的行動，更是每況愈下，整日的不在家裏，每月對於家庭的經濟供給，也漸漸的減少了，可是，無論是如何的艱困，大姊卻總是毫無怨言的竭力維持，後來大姊又接着生了兩個孩子，家庭的情形就更加艱困了，前年因了經濟的不景氣，各機關都裁員減薪，實行緊縮，而姊夫也就在這種情形之下被裁了下來，努力的在各方奔走了幾個月，結果是毫無辦法，這樣一個家庭，是真的不能維持了，於是才搬回到鄉下去，大姊蒙朋友們的幫忙，在本地找到一個敎職，而姊夫呢，她那種傲性，在本鄉是沒有事可做的。現在姊夫失業在家，精神是非常的萎靡，三天二天的生病，而大姊呢，白天去敎書，回來還要照顧四個孩子，和他們的父親，而上面又還有一對老年人的，你想她怎麼還能不憔悴呢！說到這裏，蘋的眼眶已是潤濕，也就沒有什麼可說的了。</p>
<p>回來我感到無限的氣憤，像是今天是和人吵過嘴似的呵！一個女子，是應該這樣服服貼貼，以她的幸福來換取男子們的磨難的嗎？社會對於一個賢良女子的報答，就是這無限量的重擔和萬斛的苦惱嗎？這是誰的罪惡呵！</p>

<p>面腫目虛</p>
<p>第三十四號，余靜芬女士問：（一）我今年二十歲。在十五歲以前，身體甚為虛弱。現在雖然較以前胖了些，可是平均每月中有二十天是目腫面虛，頭暈腹脹。我的眼睛本來是很好的，一腫了眼眶就縮小，面目擁腫。飲食不易消化。（二）不知有什麼法子可使面目不腫？（三）我平日要飲十多杯濃茶，與腫有關否？（四）還是低頭寫字的時候太久？（五）血液不潔乎？（因為我在經來時當喫冷物。）（六）睡眠不足嗎？（每日約睡七小時左右）。（七）有什麼自療的方法？（八）平日應該吃些什麼東西？</p>
<p>答：（一）你是『原發性賢臟炎』。（二）保守安靜，注意食物——少飲水，忌鹽。糖，油煎的東西，肉，雞子，牛奶，豆腐以喫。雞蛋一天起碼兩個——安臥數日。藥物可用，唉，你原諒我，本來有幾種很有效的藥，奈何實在不敢介紹，因為這些藥決不是病人自己可以隨便買來喫的——分量多少，於疾病這治癒或增惡太有關係。所以我這裏祇能答覆你這一點，藥物你還是看了醫生請醫生開方給你罷！（三）有關，濃茶刺戟賢臟。（四）無關。（五）無關。但經期裏理應注意衛生，喫冷東西殊非所宜。（六）七小時睡眠不可謂不足。（七）見（二）。（八）見（二）。</p>
<p>請你原諒我，我這裏決不是賣關子，諒你是很明瞭的，一定能諒解我的困難。實在，這裏只有些無害的藥敢為介紹，性質峻烈，用得不當能出危險的藥我怎敢亂介紹給人呢？</p>
<p>小兒咨症</p>
<p>第三十五號，威海衛路積善里九十六號范友三君問·鄙人二小女今年十一歲，在九歲時發生一種奇症：無論生何病，嘔吐甚劇，吐出白痰，黃水，綠水，吐後即昏厥，口說囈語。輕則暈厥一次，重則醒後復厥，至十數次。其痛苦實不堪言狀，以致身體孱弱，有不堪不發之勢。曾徧請名醫診治，雖云是胃病，但終不能除其根。且在不發病時，飲食與常人無異，食後亦不嘔吐或痛疼。惟夜不安寐，膽甚小，與他孩不同耳。前昨二年中，月必發二次，今年則間隔三四月始發一次，發病雖減少，總冀有以斷其根耳。素聞先生高明，能將病原及治療法見示否？並請公諸報端，俾海內外患斯症者，得有救星矣！</p>
<p>答：令媛有兩症可疑，一為『　蟲』一為『癲癇』。『　蟲』不經診查，不敢妄下斷語。請將令媛大便送來診查，當有覆命也，如係『　蟲』，施『驅蟲法』，不難根本治愈。至於所用藥品，非敢自珍，亦以前條所限苦哀，難以應命耳。如大便不發現蟲卵，則是『癲癇』，此則日服『補美心』（Bromagsin）三公撮，可得而愈者也。</p>
<p>舌污口臭</p>
<p>第三十六號，寶山路虬江路口光裕里謝俊英女士問：敝人素患口臭，診治無效果，舌苔黏厚，食量減少，但口內並無疾病，（一）請問應用何等藥物？（二）此病因何而起？</p>
<p>答：女士不是口內病，而是胃病，是『消化不良』。日服『阿雪多斯陪潑辛』（Aceiose-pep-sin）三次，每食後二片，可以治愈。（二）消化不良既有原發，續發，神經之別；復有多酸，減酸，胃液缺少之分，未經檢查胃液及身體一般狀況，實在無法說明其原因。</p>
<p>小便　濁</p>
<p>第三十七號，法租界白爾路蘭馨里二十三號，殷森慶君問：敝人固始育期（？）內，患手淫六七年之久，故『性神經衰弱』。雖經七八年之攝生，然動則氣急，目倦，頭脹；一月之內，必有三四之遺精。</p>
<p>近五個月前，因不潔交媾後，忽引起『攝護腺漏（？）』，身倦肢疲，食慾不振。雖注射『搭司托僅』三十餘次，且近來注射靜脈內三CC之二％礦化鉀（？）十餘次，近來仍覺身倦無力，尿中分泌物終不肯消失，每次小便有一二條如線狀。且稍微走動，體倦益甚，尿且涃渾。置玻璃杯中二三分鐘，涃濁之物質，或沉或浮，呈雲狀。請問（一）『性神經衰弱』，注射何種針藥最有效，次數。（二）『攝護腺漏』之短期根治法。（三）渾濁物是否腰子內之蛋白質？根治法？</p>
<p>答：顏君是否『攝護腺漏』，不得而知。照來信而言，不似『攝護腺漏』，而似『慢性淋病』。不過這只有顏君自己明瞭，在我們作醫師的人，沒有診查過，光看信面上的幾句話，實在不能說到度是什麼病。（一）『性神經衰弱』的治療主要靠衛生，顏君雖說『七八年之攝生』，但不知攝生之是否得其法。不得其法的話雖多何益？（二）按摩，冷坐浴，平流電療，內服『補美心』（Bromagsin）。（三）不是蛋白，如果顏君說的『攝護腺漏』是確實的話，這渾濁是精絲，攝護腺上皮，和精液。蛋白是有的，但不用化騐，顏先生的眼睛是看不出的。治療，祇要原病治好，這不過是一種症狀，當然同時治好。原病不治好，渾濁物沒有了，也沒有什麼好處。不過顏先生必要治癒的藥，服『唹華葉素』（Uvarsol），及『清濁便』（Citropin）可也。</p>
<p>遺精的恐懼</p>
<p>第三十八號，馬如心君問：我還是一個十七歲的孩子，於今年纔發育（？），可恨因為看到了淫畫和淫書，及聽到了一般人的淫語，上了他們的當，於是就發生了淫念，慢慢的行起手淫來了。不料最近數日晚間流出精液，旁人謂之『遺精』，不勝恐懼之至。因為畢生幸福或將失去，不得已，請求先生，望詳告我：（一）有何自療方法？（二）不療將如何結果？</p>
<p>答：手淫果然不好。不過手淫不是一種病，原因是你的淫念，自己沒有約束自己的能力。所以以後之能否戒絕，也要視你自己有沒有戒絕的絕心！淫念，這是每一個春機發動期的青年的必有現像，不如此就不是一個健全的青年。不過這種思想完全是基於對異性的一種神秘思想，你這時的惟一匡正方法是看一看生理解剖書，打破這種神秘的思想。我這這句話如果說得太含糊，一定又將導你往歧路上去了，因為一般書肆裏面的書，名字上是貫輸人的性智識，實際上是迎合青年人的心理，在那裏變相的賣性史。太興寧的書怕你看不懂，太淺的就流入上敘那一流，折衷的辦法，你去到四川路北京路口廣協書局，去買一本生理解剖圖譜。看了以後，你一定會覺悟你現在的行為可笑。（一）『遺精』是每一個健康男性所有的生理現像，不過初次遺精以後往往引起恐怖。這你不要怕，一個月要有一二次於健康無碍，次數多的，可以服『補美心』（Bromagsin），睡前服三十滴。（二）見（一），次數太多了，如一星期一二次，不治愈却有弄成『性神經衰弱』的危險。</p>
<p>慢性赤痢</p>
<p>第三十九號，梅白格路，一一一號金城印刷文具公司，趙望君問：家父年五十三歲，民國十九年起患紅痢，但不帶血（？），大便如香油腳沫，紅色而帶泡沫。不到十分鐘，便想坐囤。而腹痛異常，肛門如縮小不能下，請問須用何藥。</p>
<p>答：令尊的病治愈非常便利，祇須一個星期可以痊癒。但是在治療以前先要檢查大便。因為赤疾有兩種——『阿米巴性』和『細菌性』——兩種病的病狀一樣，原因，療法却絕對不同。如果診斷了是細菌性的，服『敵疾菌汁』（Dphage）最效。如果是阿米巴性，注射『依米丁』（Brnetin）亦能痊癒，實在沒有法子，有種種困難不能行大便檢查的，一日三次，每次四粒，服『去痢的靈』（Tryterin）。</p>
<p>頑固便秘</p>
<p>第四十號，朱萃林君問：敝人素患頑固便秘，每次必隔七八日之久，便時乾硬，痛苦異常。服過瀉藥無效，苦無根治之法。</p>
<p>答：飲食多吃菜蔬，油類，飲冷開水，多吃水果；最重要的是養成習慣，每日晨起，沒有大便也坐一回便桶。藥物用『開寒露』（Giyceol）擠入肛門內。</p>
<p>小便破爛</p>
<p>第四十一號，狄思威路七十五號鍾君問：（一）鄙人旬日前冶遊，包皮內部破爛一處，不動不痛，若以藥水洗之則覺痛，請問此是何症？（二）軟性下疳是否亦須打六〇六藥針？</p>
<p>答：（一）經此時期始發破爛者，大可硬性下疳之可矣，請騐血以釋疑團。（二）軟性下疳無須打六〇六。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>武化</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>雷宗海教授在社會科學第一卷第四期，有「無兵的文化」一文，獨立評論君衡先生，特為摘要而補充其說，題目「建設有兵的文化」我想此種題目於義雖屬相符，而字面究嫌累墜，不若用「建設武化」四字，比較真捷了當。</p>
<p>雷教授謂秦以上為自動自主的歷史。人民能當兵肯當兵對國家負責任。秦以下人民不能當兵不肯當兵對國家不負責任因而一切都不能自主完全受自然環境與人事環境的支配。這樣一個完全消極的文化，主要的特徵便是沒有真正的兵也便是沒有國民也便是沒有政府生活，故簡單言之，祇有消極的文化，而沒有積極的武化。</p>
<p>故君衡先生謂，這裏所說秦前秦後的區別，可以說是徵兵與募兵制的區別，無兵的文化是募兵制當然的結果，有兵的文化是徵兵制當然之結果，此兩種制度的孰優孰劣，孰利孰害，不必去徵引歷史上的事實，而已可判明共利害，語曰「若要恩固除非自做」天下仰面求人的事，沒有一仲是　得住的。</p>
<p>若募兵之制，兵之目的祇在金錢而不知愛國，故有「吃糧不管事」的古諺，若徵兵之制原出自願，其目的在於愛國而不在金錢，兩者相較，其距離真別天壤，蓋國家之所以成為國家，原以土地，人民，政治，為要素，故國內的治安和組織，全以政治，禮教，法律，為維持，而國外的侵凌，全以兵力為防禦，故凡為其國之國民，人人有保守疆土的責任，人人有保護人民的責任，人人有保護國權的責任，故保疆土，保人民，保國權，而歸根結底便是保護自己一身一家。</p>
<p>能視一國的存亡，便如一身一家的存亡，國家的仇敵，便如一身一家的仇敵，則文化必改為武化，弱國變為強國，其關鍵即在於是，自一般家天下之流，鑒於國內野心家之多，而不易制裁，於是力言文化而不主武化，舍徵兵而用募兵，因此二千年來，中國總是一部或全部受外族統治，或茍且自主而須忍受深厚的外侮，可知從前的政策，都是防家賊的政策，而忽略了防外盜的政策，所以籌成這樣的大錯。</p>
<p>自重文輕武這習慣，深入人心，募兵之制，行之已久，於是人民認為國家的禍亂與人民無關，國家的存亡，也與人民無關，而國家遂不可救藥矣，但是徵兵之制，前清之季，亦曾行之，而毫無結果，其故安在？不知從前的徵兵，是自由式的徵兵，而非強迫式的徵兵，共當兵出於自願，而並不加以強迫，現在的徵兵，當用全國皆兵之制強迫徵兵，人人有當兵的義務，人人有衛國的責任，蓋一國的人民，應保護一國的國家，此天公地道的事，無所容其委卸者也。</p>
<p>若全國比兵之制行，則人人能知愛國，人人能知愛國，即人人能知保護，人與國方發生連帶關係，現在世界各國，大抵是全國皆兵之制，都是武化主義，故在此武化主義環境之中，而欲逃避武化主義的壓迫侵擾，則非用武化主義，何以救國，何以立國。</p>
<h3>遊擊</h3>
<p>— 郭卡</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>巴！……</p>
<p>站在莊前大墻上的瞭望棚上，托着槍，從交叉的樹幹間，順着月光的銀白色小河，把壓在槍機上的食指一扳，這大野間使像一疋綢子樣的脆裂開，跟着是一片沙沙的回響，在沙沙的回響中，還能聽到一縷颼的聲音，順着彎曲的河流，向朦朧的天邊隱沒了。</p>
<p>接着便異常的沉寂，河里魚梁的潺潺聲，雙清晰的送到耳邊來。</p>
<p>這是一種享樂，另一種場合里面的享樂，這莊里地主的兒子們都是上好的槍手，每晚上在那些年青人與緻的消遣里，這大野間使常會為這種暴力的聲音所懾服。</p>
<p>這晚上，跟着槍響以後，就有個看門的大黑漢子　喝道：</p>
<p>「好屌響」！</p>
<p>喊着，那漢子就湊攏來，大槍挾在腋下，在墻根的陰影里顯得黑黑的那麼一條。</p>
<p>「大少打遊擊去」？</p>
<p>「誰帶種」？</p>
<p>那被稱做大少的，把子彈皮帶出來，推進了「頂門火」，扳好保險，然後唯我獨尊的這麼喊道。</p>
<p>「今晚上有的是人，有西大門里三少二少，靳家堡表少，還有你的護兵……要多少有多少」。</p>
<p>「好，我去換上盒子槍」。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>沙沙沙，單調的腳步聲，伴着一排月光下雲片樣的影子，在路旁里匆匆的掠過。這些影子有時被路南高梁地的陰影吞沒了，有時女刺到路北邊的　榖地里去，一　到較寬的黃土道上時，便看清了有人提着盒子槍，大姆指扳着機頭，有的斜提着步槍，食指伸在機圈里，沒有人輕易說一句話，只有噶吱噶吱的高梁向上生長的聲音。</p>
<p>一羣人出了莊，順着小道向西走了一里多路，就拐向南，走下一個斜坡，順着河岸向東折回。</p>
<p>河岸上生着叢叢的隨河柳，還有一座密密的小樹林子，樹林子里不時的有撲喇喇的野鳥飛出來帶露水的葉子，會突然貼在人的　子上。</p>
<p>大家都「」「」捏一把汗，穿出樹子來；不知誰模倣着那黑漢子的口吻說道：</p>
<p>「好屌險地方」！</p>
<p>人們的心都弛鬆開，臉上浮出點知影來。前面是一個圓圓的天罩下來的大地，夏雨的風舒徐的吹撫着人們的胸襟。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>在下游約有半里路以外的沙灘上，有兩個人在打魚。那年老的一個頭上盤條細小的髪辮，兩隻　樹枝子樣的手臂正掛着一面綱，瞅着那波動的水面；那綱在手底下擺了兩擺就飛起去，那老人保持着打太極拳的姿勢，直看到那綱圓圓的罩進　里去，才蹲下來，慢慢的收着綱綱。這時那剛投下綱去的水面上，就有一個大圓圈，漸蕩漸遠的消滅了。</p>
<p>左邊一個小夥子正在弓着身拾綱，綱腳子上的泥水，不住的摔到他駝蹄樣的光腳和棒鎚樣的小腿上，他一國拾着綱一邊說道：</p>
<p>「這一綱算是白打了，什麼是有一個魚影！——呵樹葉子，破鞋，——不錯還有一隻小蝦，……」</p>
<p>他收拾了一回就提起綱丟進水里涮涮的沖洗着。一抬頭看見老頭已經收上綱來，他問：</p>
<p>「怎麼樣？」</p>
<p>「憑命吧！」</p>
<p>「殷子大叔，咱們得挪地方，你看！那葉子前面的鯉魚拐子，（一）他媽的到水面上來欺負人！」</p>
<p>「你小點聲，早晚惹得莊里邊開槍！」他一邊拾着綱，一邊把腔調拉長了：「我年輕的時候，好像魚也多，打起來也方便，現在夜里打魚還得偸偸摸摸的，好傢伙，一塊大石頭！莊里邊聽見會放槍，碰到胡子（二）更不用說！——」說到這里他咯微一停，又蘇瓦下去說道：「我說上面有人大概是，沙溜子（三）起來了！」</p>
<p>兩個人都側着耳朶聽，空氣非常靜默，河里的水淙淙的流着，天上有沙溜子的啾啾的呌聲。</p>
<p>一會兒，那小夥子　栗說話，老頭就趕緊擺擺手，壓着嗓子說：</p>
<p>「有人！」</p>
<p>兩個人，都轉過身來，弓着腰，向着那腳步聲傳來的方向窺探。</p>
<p>不遠處，那樹林子里，一行人走路的腳步聲隱隱然傳來。</p>
<p>那老人幾科是耳語着說：</p>
<p>「壞了！碰着打魚的是天大的忌諱！」</p>
<p>那老人慢慢的滾下河里去，爬到深水里，只露着個頭。小夥子想道：那却不見得好！他懷着一點好奇心，又相信自己的手腳跑起來還來得及，就湊到前面一墩臘條後面躲着，却忘了自己身上穿的白布坎肩，在夜里是最惹眼的。</p>
<p>那邊一行人，自從走出那火樹林子後，就放心的在河邊花生地里，或稀疏的大樹林子里走着，不時的誰還可以說句把笑話，看看景緻，扒兩墩花生。正走着，突然走在前面的大黑漢子轉過身來，弓着腰，兩手張在肋上作成一個王八姿勢，沙沙的說道：</p>
<p>「前面有人，」</p>
<p>大家一陣緊張，都把槍橫在手里，扳開保險，做出一種隨時可放的姿勢往前進。</p>
<p>大黑漢子，向着號臘條叢後面躲躲閃閃的白影子，大喊了一聲。</p>
<p>當下那影子就小兔樣的一驚，順着個斜坡撒腿跑了下去。</p>
<p>幾科就是同時，那被稱做大少的舉起盒子槍來，巴巴的放了兩響。</p>
<p>那影子跟蹌了一下，歪倒了。</p>
<p>這邊，留出兩個站外哨的來，其餘的人就一團圍上去。那小夥子臉朝地爬着，背後的坎肩上沁沁的冒着鮮血。一個漢子俯下身去，湊近死人的臉子看一看，就驚喊起來：</p>
<p>「這不是西莊萬四他兒？」</p>
<p>大家一怔。有人木然的吐出句話來</p>
<p>「他來做什麼？」</p>
<p>「不用管，死在槍底下的就是土匪！」</p>
<p>這話是那個被稱做大少的說的，他眼就有了主意。</p>
<p>不多時，腳步聲漸走漸遠，這大野里又復歸於沉默，河灘上柳筐子里的銀色小魚，在月光下燦然的閃着。</p>
<p>注（一）：就是小鯉魚。</p>
<p>（二）：「胡子」就是土匪，土匪碰見捕魚的是忌諱，在這場合漁人常常被殺害。</p>
<p>（三）：就是沙鷗。</p>
<h3>禁閉室裏的一個兵</h3>
<p>— 石驊</p>
<p>「咱終有這麼一天……」得標又用力的在虎根的腿上揑了一把。幾枝槍斜倒在墻上，幾塊擦槍布扯得粉碎的，那隻油瓶子快要打到地上來了，他們也不擦槍，兩個子斜橫在牀上。這房間是黑暗的！完全黑暗的。白天沒有陽光，晚上沒有燈光。</p>
<p>「你又來了，小心禿忘八呢」，虎根趕怕把他的手推開。</p>
<p>「你怕他，我偏不怕，看他做一輩子的孝子不成！他媽的，我揍死他」。</p>
<p>「好好的又罵人，我問你，你究竟為了什麼才被送進來的」？虎根把身子更橫得斜一些，幾乎是　在牀上了。得標却有勁的坐起來了。</p>
<p>「還不是為了臭花娘？這婆娘實在太嫖緻了，要不，咱又不是瞎眼，會跟王排長這小忘八羔子吃酸」？</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>「臭花娘，我的褲子為什麼不拿來？給你野老公了吧」？</p>
<p>「死人」。</p>
<p>「啊唷！這紅的是什麼呀？你穿過這褲子的是不是？一定穿過的，不然，這是那裏來的」？陳鬍子把褲子送在她眼前要她看，順便在她蘋果似的臉上揑了一把。</p>
<p>「死人，要死哉」。何論在什麼時候，他們對她什麼動作，她總是笑嘻嘻的罵上兩句。在他們心中這是最好聽的音樂了，什麼都跟不上。惟恐她不罵，經她一罵全身就像輕了幾百斤似的一般的舒適，同時整天的疲勞也就在這笑罵中發洩掉。</p>
<p>「臭花娘洗的衣服倒蠻香的，真像她的……」話還沒講完，老徐就撲過去，偸偸地，不，與其說偸偸地，不如說強制的親了一個臉，一溜烟的逃跑了。引得他們笑起來了，他們不是笑這動作，因為這是司空見慣的，他們笑是臭</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>花娘臉上的一堆芝蔴，原來老徐還吃着大餅，却這樣急先錄的開了第一砲，把臉唇上的芝蔴，印在她的嬌小的臉上。</p>
<p>臭花娘又是駡：</p>
<p>「死人，死快哉」。</p>
<p>「別胡鬧了，讓人象去吧」。得標做「假好人」</p>
<p>「得標，你今天沒衣裳洗」？她感恩，所以特別問他。</p>
<p>「有有，慢慢我拿來」</p>
<p>臭花娘去了，臨走還深深地對他們一笑。</p>
<p>「晚上我到你家裏來玩」。他笑迷迷的說。</p>
<p>「來就來哉」。</p>
<p>「八句鐘，準定八句鐘」。他拖住她臂膊不肯放。</p>
<p>「好吧」。</p>
<p>這是個上弦的夜，香蕉似的月亮，很早地就跑出來了，星兒也特別的明亮，像怕得標看不淸楚路似，普照了這大地。</p>
<p>得標懷着一個狐疑的心，慢慢地向前走。她眞的會跟我好嗎？不會吧，她不是待王排長很好的嗎？不，或許會的，不然她幹麼答應我呢？這小蹄子眞乖，他想。</p>
<p>走，越走越近，那扇門是他認熟了的，雖然如此，但他沒有進去過一次。門裏有些燈光透出來，他想她等他好久了，心中一定是很急了，我為什麽不趕快進去呢？</p>
<p>他絕不猶豫的進去了。</p>
<p>「呀！」他想把脚退出來，可是已來不及了。</p>
<p>「李得標，你來幹嗎？」王排長霍的從牀上跳起來。</p>
<p>「報吿排長：我…我…」</p>
<p>「你來幹嗎？」</p>
<p>「我來交洗的衣服，」</p>
<p>衣服呢」</p>
<p>「唔——」</p>
<p>第二天李得標就被送入禁閉室來了。</p>
<p>上面批下來說：查王彪排長，管理所屬有功，記大功一次，以示獎勵……</p>

<h3>After Important Agreement, Japan Decides to Send Kuwashima to Nanjing to Convey New Resolution to Ambassador Kawagoe; Will Sincerely Convey Japanese Intentions to Chiang and Zhang; Finance Minister Says No Conflict Will Occur at Present</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government decided on the morning of the 2nd to dispatch Kuwashima, the Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to Nanjing to convey a new resolution to Ambassador Kawagoe. Kuwashima may depart for China as early as the evening of the 2nd. (Central News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Prime Minister Hirota reconvened Foreign Minister Arita, Navy Minister Nagano, and Vice Minister of the Army Umezu at 9:15 this morning for a meeting. Kuwashima, the Director of the Asian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also participated in the meeting. They exchanged information and opinions regarding the Sino-Japanese situation. Subsequently, they thoroughly discussed a new plan for negotiations with China based on recent developments. As a result of the meeting, it was decided to dispatch Kuwashima, the Director of the Asian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to Nanjing to convey an important mission. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained the reason for Kuwashima's dispatch to China, stating that although Ambassador Kawagoe and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had repeatedly exchanged opinions via telegrams regarding the negotiations in Nanjing, neither party could fully express their opinions in the telegrams. Furthermore, the Japanese government believed it necessary to convey Japan's true intentions to President Chiang and Foreign Minister Zhang. In addition, Japanese Finance Minister Baba stated before leaving for Osaka today that the situation in China should not cause panic, as it did not appear that a conflict would occur at present. (Central News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to an official statement by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, the government has decided to have Kuwashima, the Director of the East Asia Bureau, personally deliver Japan's intentions toward China to Ambassador Kawagoe in China. Kuwashima will depart for Shanghai tonight. This move was decided upon by government officials in a meeting based on information from the Chinese side regarding the recent developments in the current Sino-Japanese situation. Attendees included Prime Minister Hirota, Navy Minister Nagano, Foreign Minister Arita, and Vice Minister of the Army Umezu. A cabinet meeting was held immediately after the adjournment. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Suma, the secretary of the Japanese Embassy, visited Vice Minister Chen Jie of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 5:30 p.m. on the 2nd for a brief discussion of twenty minutes before departing. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The hurried departure of Director Kuwashima to Nanjing has already been mentioned in previous telegrams. During this period of Sino-Japanese negotiations, it is unprecedented for a director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to carry instructions from his government to the capital of China, indicating the degree of tension in the Sino-Japanese negotiations. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Kuwashima, the Director of the East Asia Bureau, is scheduled to depart from Tokyo for Nanjing at 9:30 tonight, carrying the specific plan decided upon by the three ministries (Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy) to convey to Ambassador Kawagoe. (Same as above, Domei News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The situation in Sino-Japanese negotiations is becoming increasingly chaotic, and the urgency of diplomatic relations between the two countries is increasing daily. Prime Minister Hirota convened Foreign Minister Arita, Navy Minister Nagano, Vice Minister of the Army Umezu, and Director Kuwashima of the East Asia Bureau at the Prime Minister's official residence before the cabinet meeting on the morning of the 2nd to hold important discussions centered on information received by each ministry. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Sino-Japanese negotiations, which had been stalled, are expected to formally begin in the next four to five days due to Chiang Kai-shek's visit to Nanjing. The foreign affairs, army, and navy authorities have been holding policy coordination meetings for days. Based on the policies decided upon at these meetings, Prime Minister Hirota, Foreign Minister Arita, Navy Minister Nagano, Vice Minister Umezu, and other government leaders have been carefully deliberating. The foreign affairs authorities issued an opinion on this matter at 12:30 p.m. on the 2nd, stating that the outcome of this Sino-Japanese negotiation is of great significance, as Sino-Japanese relations have reached a major fork in the road where they could either improve significantly or deteriorate severely. Therefore, the Imperial Government is handling the negotiations with a cautious attitude. At the same time, it recognizes the current situation as being quite serious, so the Imperial Government must fully and thoroughly convey the government's true intentions to President Chiang and Foreign Minister Zhang. Since the start of these negotiations, the Imperial Government's intentions have been communicated from time to time through telegrams, but telegrams alone cannot fully convey the meaning. Therefore, Foreign Minister Arita has decided to dispatch Kuwashima, the Director of the East Asia Bureau, to Nanjing today (the 2nd) to fully convey the government's true intentions to Ambassador Kawagoe, so that Japan's claims can be implemented in future negotiations. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Kuwashima, the Director of the East Asia Bureau, who was ordered by Foreign Minister Arita to go to Nanjing, is scheduled to depart from Tokyo Station at 9:30 p.m. on the 2nd. At 11:00 a.m. on the 3rd, he will take the Nagasaki Maru from Kobe directly to Shanghai and then proceed to Nanjing to meet with Ambassador Kawagoe. After completing his mission in Nanjing in two or three days, he will return to Japan as soon as possible to report to Foreign Minister Arita in preparation for the future development of Sino-Japanese negotiations. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Hirota is scheduled to go to Hokkaido from Ueno Station at 7:00 p.m. on the 3rd to report on the progress of Sino-Japanese diplomatic negotiations. He is expected to arrive in Sapporo at 7:00 p.m. on the 4th and stay at the Etsuchuya Hotel in front of the station. On the 5th, he will meet with the Emperor to report on the progress of Sino-Japanese negotiations and general political affairs. On the 6th, after attending a military review, he will continue to attend a banquet. He may depart from Sapporo on the evening of the 6th or the morning of the 7th to return to Tokyo, and will inspect the northeast along the way. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) When the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with members of the press today, he was asked whether the recent Sino-Japanese situation had become more serious. The spokesperson replied that he did not know. He had not received any definite information about when President Chiang would return to Beijing, but he had heard that Nanjing was preparing to celebrate the unification of the country. During the conversation, the spokesperson left for ten minutes to consult with the Foreign Minister and other officials. Upon his return, he read the following statement to the public: "Foreign Minister Arita reported to members of the press on September 28 that the current Sino-Japanese negotiations are extremely serious. China is now at a crossroads, and the Japanese government is handling the negotiations with great care. At the same time, the overall situation is extremely serious, so we acknowledge the need to convey Japan's true intentions to General Chiang Kai-shek and General Zhang Qun. We have been exchanging telegrams with Ambassador Kawagoe, but telegrams cannot convey our full meaning, so the Foreign Minister has decided to send Kuwashima (Director of the Asian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) to China to communicate the Japanese government's intentions directly to Kawagoe." (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Amau yesterday issued a statement, vehemently attacking the Reuters news agency, blaming the Reuters news agency for publishing news dispatches all over the world concerning demands that Japan had issued to China. The spokesman claimed this news was based on visionary propaganda with ulterior motives to alienate China and Japan, and they might now have to take corresponding measures to put a stop to this type of behavior. Domei news agency has also broadcast similar criticisms. According to an investigation, the news dispatches being criticized by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs were those sent by the London Reuters news agency to places all over the world, the text of which was as follows: "Reuters has learned from diplomatic sources in London that the conditions that Japan presented to China for settling disputes include: (1) Deploying troops at various points along the Yangtze River to protect the rights of Japanese residents; (2) Revising textbooks to prevent the communication of anti-Japanese sentiments to Chinese school children; (3) Autonomy for the five provinces in North China; (4) Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, the specific nature of which has not yet been determined. It is reported that the British government is now closely monitoring the progress of the Sino-Japanese negotiations through its ambassadors stationed in Tokyo and Nanjing." According to investigation, other news agencies have also transmitted the same news, but the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is directing its attacks exclusively at Reuters. In recent times, there have been a lot of rumors circulating concerning the demands that Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe presented during negotiations in Nanjing. Reuters has been very cautious in its handling of these rumors. A large number of the news dispatches that Reuters has issued have been drawn from Japanese newspapers, as Japanese-language newspapers have recently been publishing very detailed information about the negotiations in Nanjing. For example, on September 21, Reuters cited the following demands, as reported in the Yomiuri Shimbun: "Set up the five provinces of Hebei, Chahar, Shandong, Shanxi, and Suiyuan as buffer zones. The Nanjing government should still enjoy suzerainty over the region, but the authority to appoint and dismiss officials, the right to taxation, and the right to military control should all be handed over to local autonomous governments; (2) Make use of the current opportunity to temporarily resolve the complicated problems of the contract for inter-China transportation, with a particular focus on aviation; (3) China should make fundamental revisions to the tariff regulations applied to Japanese goods after the September 18th Incident; (4) China should hire as many Japanese people as possible as advisors. Reuters appropriately quoted the words of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman on the same day, saying that most of the speculation reported in the newspapers about possible demands presented by Japan to China was based on ideals."

<p>(Beiping) Japanese Embassy Military Attaché Imai stated that since the occurrence of the incidents of Japanese residents being attacked by rioters in Shanghai, Hankou, and Beihai, investigations have been conducted for a long time without any concrete solutions. The Japanese government and public are very angry and hope that the Chinese government will pay attention. Reports stating that the Japanese army in Beiping and Tianjin will conduct a second exercise are a kind of operation for the military education of the Japanese army, which is extremely normal and has no special meaning. As for whether a second exercise will be held in the future, it has not yet been determined. Song Zheyuan met with Tashiro several times in Tianjin, but the contents of the meeting are unknown.

<h3>Tianjin and Qinhuangdao Customs Revenue Drops Drastically; At Most Only 20 Million Can Be Collected This Year; Ministry of Finance Plans to Strengthen the Organization of Each Customs Office</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) In order to rectify the North China customs and meticulously suppress smuggling, the Ministry of Finance has transferred Dehkes, the customs officer of Wenzhou, to be the customs officer of Qinhuangdao, and the former customs officer Molita has been transferred away. The total customs revenue of Tianjin and Qinhuangdao in North China from January to the end of September was more than 15 million yuan. Now there are still three months until the end of the year, and it is estimated that at most 18 million or 20 million yuan will be collected this year. Although it is currently the peak season, the value of exported goods still exceeds the value of imported goods. Tianjin Customs can barely maintain its operations, while Qinhuangdao Customs is collecting almost 75 percent less each month than it did last year. The annual revenue of the two customs offices this year is estimated to be more than halved compared to last year's revenue of 40 million yuan. The Ministry of Finance's transfer of Jiang Weiting and Dehkes to be the customs officers of the two customs offices is intended to strengthen the organization of each customs office, and then to seek external solutions. Although smuggling cannot be completely eradicated for a time, at least smugglers should have some concerns. According to news from Zhangjiakou, smuggled goods are recently being abandoned on the Ping-Sui line and transported from Rehe via the Zunhua highway to Zhangbei, and then enter Suiyuan, Ningxia, Gansu, and Qinghai. The Ministry of Finance has recently established an inspection branch in Datong to intercept them. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) In North China, smuggling has been eradicated everywhere except in Hebei Province. All smuggled goods in Hebei Province use Tianjin as the final destination. The Ministry of Finance is planning a fundamental strategy to stop the source, and has ordered Ansier to move the Road Transportation Inspection Headquarters to Tianjin and Beijing, leaving a branch office under the responsibility of Li Tonghua. Li is currently in Tianjin awaiting orders from the ministry. The location of the office has been found at 124 Tenth Road in the British Concession. A committee will be established to handle matters related to the supplementary tax registration of smuggled goods in Hebei and Chahar. The general outline has been determined, but it is more difficult to appoint a responsible person by the ministry, and it will be announced together with the regulations after a decision is made. The sale of smuggled goods in Tianjin is becoming increasingly prosperous. The price of wool fabrics is extremely low. A woolen coat that sold for 14 yuan in previous years now only sells for 4 yuan. European and American goods cannot be sold. Automobiles and machinery parts are also being dumped in large quantities, and the market is almost monopolized. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Style of Inventory Sales Permit</h3>
<p>Established by the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance previously stipulated that in areas in the interior that do not have customs offices, goods purchased and stored before the implementation of the sales regulations should first be registered with the local chamber of commerce. If they need to be transported to other places, the chamber of commerce should verify that they match the goods registered and issue an inventory sales permit to facilitate transportation. A format for the inventory sales permit has now been established, ordering all relevant agencies to instruct local chambers of commerce to uniformly print and prepare them for use, in order to achieve consistency.

As for Yu Likui, he is a native of Anhui, in his forties, who once served as the head of the Iron-Blooded Assassination Corps.

<h3>Sino-Japanese Relations are Extremely Tense: Our Common Opinions and Beliefs - Respectfully Informing the People of the Nation and the Japanese Government and Public</h3>
<p>In recent days, relations between China and Japan have become extremely tense. The situation in East Asia is clouded, crises abound, and the fate of a century will be decided at this moment. We, who hold the public opinion and are the spokespersons of the public, have the responsibility to convey public opinion both internally and externally. Therefore, we, with the joint signature of the newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai, simply and directly outline what we see and believe, in order to inform the people of the whole country, and are willing to convey it to the government and public of Japan through our neighboring media colleagues. We wish to tell our compatriots in this country that the nation is facing a major moment. All our citizens must be solemn and serious, and fulfill their responsibilities as citizens. In this regard, there are two meanings that we wish to state first. First, the nation exists in the world and must be established. Survival or destruction depends entirely on human effort. Justice will not disappear and righteousness will not be worn away. Human affairs must follow the normal path. No matter how special the situation is, we must uphold the normal path and deal with it with stability, not swayed by temporary emotions or intimidated by the current situation. We must do our best and organize our steps and concentrate our will, and obey the overall national policy. All ideas of taking risks and seeking luck should be swept away. Actions of division and self-destruction should be absolutely despised. Upholding the spirit of peace, integrity, and magnanimity that our nation has always adhered to, and establishing the self-confidence that our nation will never perish, we must be resolute, united, respectful of order, and strict in discipline. We must exert the full strength of the people to assist the government, curb the conspiracy to blindly hate foreigners and provoke incidents, simplify the situation, and avoid increasing difficulties for the country. At the same time, we must warn and encourage each other, not to be afraid, not to be arrogant, and maintain the upright and dignified demeanor of our people in this extraordinary situation, and wait for the situation to turn around. This is the first point. Second, we hope that all citizens will plan for the worst and seriously recognize their obligations. All citizens of China, regardless of their political views and ideals, should at this time solemnly and thoroughly consider the long-term destiny of the nation. We must not lightly talk about rupture for the sake of momentary gratification, nor can we give up and seek only temporary peace. Today's external relations, the results of the changes, are completely different from those of several years ago. Once broken, we must bet the entire nation's life on the end, with absolutely no possibility of stopping halfway. As the old saying in our country goes, "Either I die or he dies." If China and Japan unfortunately reach a rupture, the severity is just like this. Once the conflict starts, if China makes a deal with the enemy, it would be signing its own death warrant. Generations of descendants will truly never recover. We must be determined to sacrifice ourselves to the end, only then can we have a bright hope of survival. Therefore, at this time, we should value the rupture and expect a recovery. If things become irreversible, we can only lead 400 million people to defend the nation and die for the nation at the last moment. This is the second point. In addition to the above two points, we hope that our neighboring colleagues will express just opinions and make the government and public of Japan aware of two extremely important things. First, the government and public of our neighboring nation must recognize the nature of the recent unfortunate events that have frequently occurred in China. In the past four or five years, the alienation of the feelings of the people of China and Japan has been an undeniable fact. Moreover, due to the deterioration of national relations, the emotional intensity has been several times higher than today. However, in the past four or five years, Japanese expatriates in China have continued to work peacefully and have not suffered any unfortunate events. Only recently, when national relations between the two countries are being adjusted and the situation in East Asia has shown hope for improvement, incidents have continuously occurred in Chengdu, Beihai, Hankou, and Shanghai within a month. From the standpoint of the Chinese people, we should express regret for the unwarranted harm to the people of our neighboring country. However, to conclude that the occurrence of such incidents is a clear sign of the universal anti-Japanese sentiment of the Chinese people is actually a serious slander of the Chinese people. If we use these unfortunate events to fundamentally change the state of interaction between the two countries, preach punishment, and take an oppressive posture, not only will the Chinese people find it mentally difficult, but it will also be unwelcome by enlightened Japanese people. Judging from the recent various unfortunate incidents, such despicable acts of xenophobia and violence against individuals from neighboring countries, and the harm to the entire China, no Chinese people with a slight sense of national consciousness would be willing to do such absurd and foolish things. There is no doubt that the instigation of these incidents is a conspiracy to deliberately destroy China and intend to promote a rupture between China and Japan. The more the Japanese side seeks to expand these incidents, the more these conspirators will feel that their poisonous plans have succeeded. On the contrary, if the Japanese government and public can see through this point, only expect China to fulfill its normal international responsibilities, and not change its original intention of adjusting national relations due to various incidents, the conspirators will realize that their tricks have failed and will naturally stop. Therefore, if Japan shows a generous attitude towards China, the goodwill it sows among the Chinese people will be the most effective way to eradicate the so-called "anti-Japanese sentiment." Second, the Japanese media should attach importance to the long-term interests of the two countries and do their best to restore the normal state of national relations. China and Japan can support each other and move towards prosperity together, or they can fight each other and fall into a desperate situation together. We, on the one hand, are doing our best to persuade our people to restrain their emotions and value facts. At the same time, at this critical moment, we cannot help but make an honest analysis to the neighboring media. In the past few years, the feelings between the two countries have repeatedly been on the verge of rupture. Recently, we are trying to adjust this unfortunate relationship. The reason why adjustment is possible is because we are equally concerned about the safety and interests of the situation in East Asia, and because there has not been a full-scale conflict. If we do not work together to fundamentally adjust the situation and allow the situation to deteriorate, the severity of the situation in the future will exceed the Songhu War and the Great Wall War. Under the pressure of the situation, if China does not sacrifice to the end, it will be completely subjugated. The national will of the Chinese people is so strong that they will never allow the government to make compromises and endure for peace, such as the events of January 28 and the Great Wall War. With the two major nations holding each other back, this will truly become a deep and permanent hatred. China will inevitably suffer the most tragic sacrifice, and how can Japan escape the vortex of this East Asian collapse? We, in view of the enthusiasm of the Japanese public opinion for fundamental adjustment, deeply regret that if the opportunity is lost, it will never be recovered. We sincerely hope that the Japanese media colleagues will express just opinions and solemnly awaken the attention of the Japanese government and public at this moment of crisis. The reporters in Beijing and Shanghai have done their best to encourage the people and expect their neighbors in the current Sino-Japanese relations. The safety of East Asia is of utmost importance. Eliminating and saving the situation will not come again. We deeply hope that both sides will have deep and true considerations and understandings of the current situation and the future development trends, and work together to restore the tense situation to normal as soon as possible, and that fundamental issues will not be affected by trivial matters. Is this not only the blessing of East Asia and the future of the two countries?

<h3>The Forgotten Issue of Disarmament</h3>
<p>When militaristic countries are actively preparing for war, threatening peace-loving nations, the issue of disarmament is easily forgotten. Of the seven committees at this League of Nations General Assembly, only the Chairman of the Disarmament Committee has not been appointed. The French representative, Mr. Paul-Boncour, issued an appeal to reopen the World Disarmament Conference to maintain peace, but it not only failed to resonate with powerful figures but also provoked the opposing opinion of Hungarian representative Count Csáky.</p>
<p>Since the European War, several disarmament conferences have been held. Among them, aside from the Washington Conference's restrictions on battleships and the London Conference's partial agreements on auxiliary vessels, the Disarmament Conference, which opened in February 1932, only passed some Red Cross-style resolutions. The Disarmament Conference, which opened in January 1933, only produced the Four-Power Pact of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, monopolizing the European political situation. The Disarmament Conference, which opened in October of the same year, not only failed to produce any concrete resolutions on disarmament but also resulted in the joke of Germany withdrawing from the conference, setting a precedent for militarists to openly expand their armaments. Now, not only have the military clauses in the Treaty of Versailles been torn up by Germany, but also the Washington and London naval treaties have been discarded by Japan.</p>
<p>The expansion of armaments is contagious. Since militaristic countries openly expanded their armaments, all peace-loving countries have had no choice but to relatively expand their armaments to counter the forces that threaten peace. Therefore, the military expenditures of all countries in the world have increased. According to a survey by the Berlin Institute for Economic Research, global military spending in 1935 increased by one-half compared to 1929 and had already tripled compared to 1913, before the Great War. This year's military budget for each country is even higher than last year, with the United States increasing by 16%, the United Kingdom by 20%, Japan by 36%, and France by 80%. This unrestricted expansion of armaments will increase financial panic and lead to political instability. Therefore, many peace-loving countries hope that this useless competition can end soon. The French Paul-Boncour's appeal to reopen the Disarmament Conference is based on this hope.</p>
<p>However, in the eyes of militaristic countries, the extraordinary financial burden caused by the expansion of armaments can be passed on to the masses in colonies, and domestic political instability can be alleviated through foreign expansion. Therefore, the suggestion of reopening the Disarmament Conference has very little chance of being implemented under the current world situation. Even if the conference can be reopened, it will inevitably repeat the mistakes of the past.</p>

<h3>Naval Negotiations Last Four Months; UK and Russia Reach Compromise; Japan's Shipbuilding Exceeds Treaty Limits; Soviet Russia Can Freely Follow Suit</h3>
<p>(London) The Anglo-Russian Naval Treaty, after four and a half months of negotiations, was concluded today. According to its terms, the Soviet Pacific Fleet has the right to build warships of any tonnage and caliber, but Soviet warships transferred from the Pacific to the Baltic or Black Sea must not exceed the tonnage and caliber of the Baltic and Black Sea Fleets. The formal signing date will depend on the outcome of the Anglo-German naval talks next week. (1st Dispatch from National News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) The full text of the naval treaty concluded between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union at the end of July this year has been completely agreed upon today. However, the treaty is subject to ratification by the governments of both countries and will only come into effect after Germany fulfills the London Naval Treaty of 1936 signed by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. The content of the Anglo-Russian treaty is modeled on the aforementioned three-nation naval treaty, with one exception: Soviet Russia will have the right to build seven cruisers equipped with 7.1-inch guns to replace the 6.1-inch caliber stipulated in the treaty. Soviet Russia will have freedom of action in the Far East, with the only restriction being that shipbuilding in the Far East shall not exceed the limits of the 1936 naval treaty. In other words, if Japan exceeds the provisions of the treaty, Soviet Russia can follow suit. The naval treaty further stipulates that Soviet Russia shall not transfer any warships built in the Far East that exceed the qualitative restrictions of the London Naval Treaty to Europe or the Black Sea. However, Soviet Russia has no obligation to exchange information with the United Kingdom regarding shipbuilding in the Far East. According to the Three-Power London Treaty, each country should notify each other when planning to build warships, and there are qualitative restrictions on various warships. The caliber of the main guns of battleships shall not exceed 14 inches. A "gap" or "no-building zone" is established between 8,000-ton and 15,000-ton warships. The age of ships is extended to 26 years, and the tonnage of aircraft carriers is reduced from 27,000 tons to 23,000 tons. The maximum displacement of submarines shall not exceed 2,000 tons, and the caliber of guns shall not exceed 5.1 inches. Cruisers are divided into two categories: (1) those equipped with a caliber of 6.1 inches or more shall not be built during the validity of the treaty; (2) limited to 8,000 tons, those equipped with 6.2-inch guns.

<h3>The Purpose of the World Peace Movement Conference is to Struggle for World Peace and Unity; President of the League of Nations Assembly Receives Representatives from Various Countries</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The President of the League of Nations Assembly, Argentine Foreign Minister Saavedra Lamas, received representatives from various countries attending the World Peace Movement Conference in the Assembly Hall at 5:45 pm today. The World Peace Movement Conference was held in Brussels from September 3rd to 6th, with the participation of more than 3,000 representatives from more than 40 countries. Lord Cecil, President of the League of Nations Union in Britain, served as the Chairman of the Conference.

Next, Chinese representative General Chen Mingshu spoke, requesting the League of Nations to make every effort to safeguard world peace, with particular emphasis on peace in the Far East. Then, French representative, Secretary-General of the General Confederation of Labor, Stonehouse, spoke on behalf of more than 10 million organized workers worldwide, detailing the various resolutions passed by the trade union committee at the World Peace Movement Conference, advocating for sanctions against countries that attempt aggression to prevent future troubles. In addition, in the joint declaration of trade union representatives from various countries at the Peace Conference, trade union members from various countries are obligated to refuse to manufacture and transport military equipment and ammunition for aggressor countries in the future. The trade unions of aggressor countries should also refuse to have any joint responsibility with the government bearing responsibility for aggression. Workers' organizations in various countries are also responsible for declaring that if there is a danger of war and their respective governments and the League of Nations are unable to stop it, the trade unions in each country should initiate economic sanctions against the aggressor country on their own, or even expand the scope of sanctions, in order to achieve practical results. How the adjustment mechanism for this sanctioning method should be organized has been stipulated by the World Peace Movement Conference. Finally, Secretary-General of the French Veterans Federation, Livry, spoke, hoping that the League of Nations would achieve something in disarmament, collective security, and mutual assistance systems.

<h3>Italy's Fascist Party Commemorates Taking Power; Rome Prepares for Grand Celebration; Ambassador to the UK Reported to be Replaced</h3>
<p>(Rome) Ambassador to the UK, Grandi, is currently undergoing surgery in Bologna due to illness. It is said that after he recovers, he will be transferred to an important central position.

<h3>Spanish Parliament Passes Constitution; Basque Autonomy Realized; Vow to Fight to the End to Uphold the People's Government; Franco Assumes Leadership of Revolutionary Government</h3>
<p>Madrid - The House of Representatives convened a meeting at 10 am today, chaired by Speaker Barrio, with all members of the Caballero Cabinet in attendance. The House of Representatives and its surroundings were heavily guarded, with machine guns set up in front of the doors and on nearby main roads to prevent accidents. Three aircraft protected the capital from the air. Approximately one hundred members of parliament attended, including members of the Left Republican Party, the Catalan Left Republican Alliance, the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the Basque Catholic Nationalist Party. Two members of parliament from the Centralist parties also attended. When Soviet Ambassador to Spain, Rosenberg, took his seat in the gallery, the entire venue applauded in welcome. At the beginning of the meeting, Speaker Barrio proposed that the entire venue stand and salute the soldiers of the national army, navy, and air force who are fighting for freedom. Next, the Speaker delivered an opening speech that was quite impassioned, including the phrase "Spain would rather die standing than live kneeling," which caused the entire venue to stand up and applaud. The House of Representatives immediately passed the Basque Autonomous Province Constitution and the 1937 budget with a unanimous vote.

<h3>Rebel Leader Franco Assumes New Position; Resembles a Dictator</h3>
<p>Burgos - Special dispatch from our correspondent. After the Chairman of the National Government, Cabanellas, nominated General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the National Army, as "Head of State of Spain" in the name of the military government, the military government held a meeting yesterday afternoon. General Franco immediately took office and decided that the National Military Government would hold full military and political power. At that time, the masses cheered wildly. Franco then delivered a brief speech to them, stating, "Our army has rescued Spain from the clutches of Soviet communism and returned it to the Spanish people. Our power is more than enough to make everyone respect and obey it. The revolutionary movement is a movement of the people. The reason why our army rose up is to seek the welfare of the people and the middle class. Therefore, it is everywhere supported by the people. If any foreign countries oppose our new political situation, we will sever ties with them." Observers have declared that although General Franco only wants to obtain the title of "Head of State" and does not want to be considered a "dictator," the power he holds is at least comparable to that of any dictator in the world. According to general predictions, the military government originally planned to bestow this title only after the fall of Madrid. The fact that they issued it earlier proves that the National Army is confident of victory.</p>
<h3>150,000 Troops Pressing on Madrid</h3>

General Mola, the commander of the northern front, is still stationed in Valladolid, and his position is second only to General Franco. (2nd Dispatch from Havas)</p>
<h3>Remnants of Government Troops Besieged in Toledo</h3>
<p>French Border, Spain - The rebels are now applying the same tactics to the soldiers of the Moroccan-style Alcázar fortress, which once besieged Toledo, as they did before. It is reported that they have surrounded a certain specialized school in Toledo, because there are still 50 besieged government troops inside. Government troops have held the school for four days, but they are still refusing to surrender. Anyone passing near the school is shot at by government troops. The rebels, fearing harm to residents, are unwilling to carry out bombings. It is believed that there are women and children among the besieged officers. (2nd Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3>Spanish Island Ceded to Italy and Germany; Rebel Statement Denies; British Suspicion Cleared</h3>
<p>(London) It has been rumored that after the Spanish National Army wins, it will cede the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean to Italy and the Canary Islands in the Atlantic to Germany. General Daliano, commander of the Andalusian Division of the National Army, issued a statement yesterday on the Seville radio station denying this news. This claim is also considered insignificant by semi-official British sources. Political circles are therefore speculating that the Spanish National Military Government must have made satisfactory guarantees to the British government. Therefore, British suspicion, which was overwhelming last week, has now completely cleared. (1st Dispatch from Havas)</p>
<h3>French Parliament Passes, New Currency Law Takes Effect, Franc Devaluation Immediately Implemented, Political Situation Returns to Stability</h3>
<p>(Paris) The government's proposed currency bill, after repeated debates and revisions of clauses by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, was finally passed by the Senate by a show of hands late tonight. Therefore, the bill has been completely approved by the Parliament and has legal effect. The devaluation of the franc can now be implemented, and the tense situation in French politics has also disappeared immediately. (Havas dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Paris) The dispute between the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies over the franc devaluation proposal was finally resolved today through a compromise. Both sides agreed to replace the clause granting the government dictatorial powers with a mandatory arbitration plan. It is reported that a special court will be organized to try wage disputes and various incidents between labor and management. The Chamber of Deputies' amendment to the bill, which changed the government's proposed 50% tax on profits from securities market transactions to 80%, was rejected by the Senate with 155 votes against 87. Late tonight, the Senate passed the bill in the final form passed by the Chamber of Deputies.</p>
<p>As a result, Finance Minister Warrion announced the end of the special session of this parliament. Prime Minister Pétain, with the mission accomplished, set off for Paris with League of Nations Affairs Commissioner Poncet.</p>
<p>(Paris) The franc devaluation bill passed by the Senate stipulates that a 50% tax will be levied on forward transactions of securities, excluding public bonds and national bonds, between September 21st and 26th. (Reuters dispatch on the 1st)</p>

<h3>Full Passage After Many Twists and Turns</h3>
<p>(Paris) The currency bill was discussed back and forth by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies and was finally passed in full late at night. However, there were many twists and turns in the process. In short, the compromise reached by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies today has removed the section "granting the government full power to prohibit price increases" and replaced it with a section stipulating that the government, with the consent of the National Economic Committee, may take measures to prevent price increases. The National Economic Committee is attended by representatives of all classes, so it can avoid the drawbacks of bias. Moreover, such measures must be decided by the Council of State, not by the Council of Ministers. In this way, the government's power can be further restrained. A compromise solution has also been reached regarding compensation for losses suffered by wages and pensions due to currency devaluation. The order issued by the previous Laval cabinet to reduce veterans' pensions by 30% has been decided to be cancelled and can be implemented immediately. In addition, detailed studies on the implementation of various measures will be made when the next parliament discusses the budget bill. A compromise solution has also been reached between the two houses regarding labor disputes, stipulating that a mandatory arbitration system will be used to resolve various disputes regarding wage issues. Until midnight today, only one small issue remained unresolved when the original bill was finally submitted to the Senate for discussion, namely, the Senate insisted that a special tax of 80% should be levied on profits earned in stock exchange business before September 26, while the bill finally passed by the Chamber of Deputies stipulated that 50% should be collected. However, this issue was later resolved, and the entire bill was approved by the Parliament within the final deadline (according to the government's deadline for passing the entire bill this month).

Now that Britain, France, and the United States have allocated huge funds for exchange rate stabilization, the currencies of all countries in the world can be stabilized. Finally, regarding the devaluation of the French currency, he said, "If the French government wants this move to be fully effective, then the treasury's income and expenditure must first be balanced. France will surely be aware of this." (Havas dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Speech, American Finance, Smith Vigorously Criticizes, Browder Has Been Released</h3>
<p>Pittsburgh, USA President Roosevelt delivered a campaign speech here today to 75,000 people, reiterating his promise to save the American people from famine and defending his social security plan and fiscal policy. He said, "If the 1935 budget could be balanced, it would be a crime against the American people. I firmly believe that the government's finances do not require profound calculations if they are honest. When I took office, the total national income had been reduced by half. To balance the government's income and expenditure, we must first balance the people's income and expenditure. Therefore, I was entrusted by the people of the country at a time of extreme hardship to break through the difficulties with the government's strength. During President Hoover's time, the national debt increased by 3 billion yuan, but nothing was achieved. After I took office, the national debt increased by 8 billion yuan, but more than half of it was to pay for the pensions of European war veterans. After one expenditure, there will be no further demands. The rest of the expenses are all to preserve America's natural resources. Therefore, the money we spent is an investment in the future of America. It is not like in 1922, when 30 billion yuan of American money flowed out of the country to manufacture soldiers and reduce unemployment abroad, and America did not benefit. I predict that critics will say that the increase in the national debt is 13 billion yuan, not just 8 billion yuan, but the country's assets have also increased by 6 billion yuan, which can offset each other. Moreover, there have been no bank failures in the past year, so the people do not have to fear the increase in future taxes, because all debts can be paid off by the increase in the country's total income. Judging from the current trend, the country's regular budget can be balanced within one or two years." (National News Agency dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>(New York) Al Smith, the Democratic presidential candidate in 1928, gave a speech here tonight, vigorously attacking the New Deal and urging the audience to elect Republican candidate Landon as the cure for all of America's ills, namely Landon's election. Smith said that the characteristic of the New Deal is that anyone who dares to disagree with the government's opinion is wantonly insulted. "I came from the streets of New York. Although I was later the Governor of New York, I still rely on my salary for a living. President Roosevelt, in addition to his presidential salary, all of his income is from serving as a lawyer for the company. We must ask for instruction from businessmen to permanently solve the unemployment problem." (National News dispatch on the 1st)</p>

<h3>Beihai Nakano Case, Sino-Japanese Negotiations Begin, Investigators from Both Sides Investigate the Case in Beihai, Foreigners in Beihai Prove That Locals Have Never Shown Anti-Foreign Behavior</h3>
<p>Guangzhou communication, after the Nakano Junzo murder case involving a Japanese resident in Beihai occurred, China and Japan sent personnel on ships to Beihai to investigate. When our investigator first went to Beihai, the Beihai garrison under Weng Zhaoyuan had not yet withdrawn, making the investigation difficult. Therefore, Ling Shifen returned to Guangdong first to report and asked the authorities to urge Commander Weng to withdraw. After Li Zongren returned to Guangxi from Guangdong, he ordered the withdrawal of troops, and Commander Weng withdrew to the Guangxi border on the morning of the 21st. Our investigator Ling Shifen then went to Beihai again to handle the investigation. After Commander Weng withdrew and Commander Tan took over the defense, Ling Shifen landed from the Fu'an ship on the morning of the 22nd and discussed with Commander Tan Suo a plan to protect the Chinese and Japanese investigators. The result of the discussion was that if Japanese investigators landed, the number would be limited and they would not be allowed to carry weapons. If they carried weapons and a misunderstanding occurred, we would not be responsible. Ling conveyed the agreed-upon terms to Nemoto Chonosuke, the Japanese investigator, who agreed. Then, our Tongji ship accompanied the Japanese Saga ship into the port. At 8 am on the 23rd, our investigators Ling Shifen and Yang Bingli, together with Japanese investigator Nemoto Chonosuke, Saga ship captain Miyazono Yoshito, as well as doctors, clerks, photographers, and others, a group of seven or eight people, landed together. Under the strict protection of the military police, they took five cars to the Beihai Municipal Bureau to gather the relatives of Nakano and inquire about the case. At that time, Nakano's wife and children were living in nearby villages. Hearing the news, they rushed back and personally went to the Municipal Bureau to wait for inquiries. According to their account, Nakano Junzo had a verbal conflict with a customer at the Maruichi store that day, which led to a fight. As a result, Nakano was defeated, injured, and fell to the ground. By the time the police arrived to suppress the situation, the criminals had already scattered and fled. After repeated inquiries by the investigators from both sides, the statements were recorded one by one. After a long time, Nakano's relatives were sent away. Then, they drove to the place outside the city where Nakano's coffin was parked for examination. The examination revealed that Nakano's body had not yet decayed and had slight wounds, which seemed to have been caused by a fight with someone before his death. Then, the body was photographed. Later, the investigators from both sides went to the Maruichi store set up by Nakano to inspect and collect physical evidence, and photographed it. After that, the Japanese investigators obtained the consent of Nakano's relatives and first cremated Nakano's body. His wife and children carried the ashes and boarded the Saga ship. On the morning of the 24th, the Chinese and Japanese investigators returned to Beihai and inquired in detail with the local gentry about the circumstances of the incident that day. In the afternoon, they landed again and went to the Beihai Customs Office to gather foreigners living in Beihai to inquire about the Beihai people's movement that day. The foreigners all stated that the folk customs in Beihai were simple and honest, and the relationship between Chinese and foreigners was always harmonious. There had never been any discrimination against foreigners, and they cited their decades of life as proof. The Japanese investigators were deeply pleased and thanked them before leaving. At this point, the investigation procedures in Beihai were completed. The Chinese and Japanese investigators returned to their respective ships and set off to return to their provinces. The Japanese side believed that human evidence would be needed for future negotiations on the Nakano case, so they accompanied Nakano Junzo's wife and children, a family of ten, on the Saga ship to Guangzhou. They left Beihai on the 26th and arrived in Guangzhou on the 28th. In addition, the Japanese ships Fuyo, Wakatake, Yubari Hayamiao, Kumano, etc., which were docked outside Beihai Port, also left Beihai for Shanghai on the same day under the command of Rear Admiral Hosogaya of the Japanese Navy. Our investigator Ling Shifen and others also took the Fu'an ship back to the province on the same day. They were delayed by the wind on the way and did not arrive in Hong Kong until the 28th. Ling immediately transferred to a fast train from Hong Kong to Jin Province and reported the details of the Nakano incident to Diao Zuqian, the special commissioner of foreign affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi. Diao immediately drafted a report on the case and telegraphed it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions. After receiving the investigator's report, Nakamura Toyoichi, the Japanese consul general in Guangzhou, summoned Nakano's bereaved family at the same time. On the 30th, he took the report and visited Diao Zuqian at the office of the special commissioner of foreign affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi to exchange opinions on the investigation results. Negotiations on the Nakano case began. (October 1st)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Young Man Extorting Money Apprehended</p>
<p>Zhu Yungui, an Anhui native residing in Sijing Town, Songjiang County, passed the examination to work as a postman at the town's post office in 1917. After 20 years, he had saved some money, which led to the covetousness of petty thieves. Wu Youmei and Zhu Xingen, two idle young men, coveted Zhu's property. On the night of the 30th of last month at around 7 p.m., Wu went alone to Zhu's residence, claiming to borrow 30 yuan. If he didn't lend it, he would resort to force. To prevent accidents, Zhu pretended to comply while secretly asking his wife to run and inform Shen Tiansheng, who came and grabbed Wu. When questioned, Wu claimed that he was sent by his friend Zhu Xingen to extort money. The chief of the Public Security Bureau then had Wu write a document stating that he was instigated by Zhu Xingen. They then apprehended Zhu Xingen near Wang Shengzu's door. Considering that the postman was a public official and Wu dared to insult and extort him, which was a repeated violation of the law, they sent Wu, Zhu, and the document to the 5th branch of the Public Security Bureau in charge for verification. Officer Cheng opened a court for a preliminary hearing. Considering that the case was criminal, they submitted it to the County Bureau for transfer to the District Procuratorate for investigation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Change in Transportation and Sales Sparks Panic</p>
<p>The Suzhou Iron and Steel Weaving Industry Association and the Silk and Satin Merchants Association learned that the Suzhou Customs Office planned to change the current method of issuing transportation and sales licenses. Starting from the 1st of this month, regardless of the size of the factory, goods must have a customs tax bill before a transportation and sales license can be issued. This matter is closely related to the interests of small and weak manufacturers. Therefore, the two associations convened a general meeting and decided to send representatives to the Customs Office on the 1st together with Chairman Cheng of the Chamber of Commerce to explain that the raw material of small and weak manufacturers, rayon, is purchased in small amounts from various rayon merchants and does not have a customs tax bill. If the regulations are changed to require a tax bill, the goods of small and weak factories will not be able to be transported and sold, causing great panic. They requested that the old regulations be followed. The Customs Office stated that the matter was an order from the ministry and could not be accommodated. They will postpone it for three days to see if the merchants can find a better solution. Otherwise, the new regulations will be implemented. Those without a tax bill will not be issued a transportation and sales license. Currently, the merchants in the industry have unanimously expressed their support for the current transportation and sales method. If the Customs Office does not understand, they will have no choice but to suspend business together and appeal to the authorities.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Seeking Instructions on Electoral Doubts</p>
<p>Before the election of candidates by professional groups for the National Assembly election in Jiangsu Province, someone fabricated the name of the provincial election supervisor and telegraphed to various counties, instructing them to immediately inform the chambers of commerce to fill in the names of the seven designated candidates when voting. Later, the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the province on a cold day to request clarification of the truth in order to show great trust, but had not yet received instructions. Before the election, the Wuxian County government also received this telegram. Afterwards, Zhang Yipeng, a citizen of the county, believed that this election was based on the resolutions of the Fifth National Congress of the Kuomintang last year and was of great importance to the establishment of the country. It was necessary to strictly prevent corruption. Therefore, he telegraphed the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office based on the facts, requesting an investigation and clarification of the truth in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Unifying Water Patrol Teams in Various Counties</p>
<p>At the first administrative meeting held by the Wuxi Administrative Inspectorate in July of this year, Yang Meilin, the director of the Public Security Bureau of Taicang County, proposed that the counties along the river and lake should unify the organization of water patrol teams to maintain defense. After discussion, it was decided that each county should prepare a budget based on its actual situation and submit a special report for approval. The Special Office would also schedule a meeting of the water police teams concerned and the directors of the Public Security Bureaus of the districts and counties to discuss a proper solution and submit a report for approval. As the case involved changing the police system and local finances, it was submitted to the provincial government and the relevant departments. Instructions have now been received that the commissioner should consider the actual needs and supervise the counties to strengthen patrols for maintenance. Commissioner Zang has ordered the counties to be informed.</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibiting Setting Traps for Rural Farmers</p>
<p>Zang Qifang, the administrative inspector of the Second District of Jiangsu Province, believes that the crops in the eight counties of Wuxi, Wujin, Jiangyin, Wuxian, Wujiang, Changshu, Kunshan, and Taicang in the district are quite good, and a good autumn harvest can be expected. However, with the increasing convenience of transportation, bandits from Shanghai and other places are bound to sneak into the interior, using their usual tricks to set traps for rural farmers. The resulting malpractices will not only harm the rural economy but also breed treacherous plots and harm the local area. Yesterday, he telegraphed the above-mentioned county magistrates to immediately supervise the public security officers to strictly investigate and prohibit such activities. Anyone who gambles and engages in illegal activities should be arrested and handed over to the judiciary for strict punishment to eliminate evil customs and conform to the new transport.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Boat Passenger Deceives and Rapes Cloth-Selling Girl</p>
<p>There is a civilian boat of Zhu Xiaoyuan in the river channel of Sandundun, east of the city of Tongyi. A passenger, Wang Jinlai, took the boat into the city. On the way, he saw a beautiful cloth-selling girl, Wu Lianzi, and lured her onto the boat, which sailed to a secluded place. He forcibly raped the girl. Wu Lianzi escaped and reported the crime. Wang Jin was apprehended and sent to the court for detention. The prosecutor has already filed a public prosecution.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Branch Line Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau previously received an order from the Ministry of Railways to prepare for the construction of a branch line from Zhangshu to Ganzhou. It sent engineers to organize a survey team to conduct a survey and prepared a budget for surveying expenses, totaling more than 40,000 yuan. The Ministry of Railways approved it, and the Ministry and the Jiangxi Provincial Government each shared half of the expenses. They also began to organize a survey team. Due to difficulties in raising funds, the surveying project was difficult to carry out and has been temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Salt Lake Tide in Eastern Zhejiang Has Been Resolved</p>
<p>Yuyao is a major salt-producing area in Eastern Zhejiang. Previously, manufacturers used the excuse of stopping the collection of salt, causing panic among salt farmers, and salt tides occurred repeatedly. The dispute has lasted for nine months. As a result of the mediation by the Transport Office, both parties agreed that: (1) 300 jin will be temporarily collected per board, and the remaining 81 jin will be weighed and collected when sales improve; (2) Manufacturers should sell the salt collected this time first, and when it is sold out, they will sell half of the salt stored by both the manufacturers and the salt farmers; (3) 80,000 yuan will be remitted and 4 jiao will be paid to the salt farmers per salt board as a living allowance. An agreement has been signed and the weighing and collection have been resumed.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>County Government Transfers Personnel</p>
<p>Rumors about the transfer of the county magistrate of this county, Wang Zaidao, have been circulating in the city for a long time. Wang went to Beijing once in the previous month for about ten days, and then transferred to the province. Recently, he returned to his post from Hangzhou and continued to perform his duties as usual. The transfer rumor has not been confirmed. However, since Wang's return to the county, he has shown a spirit of improvement in public security. The other day, he ordered the dismissal of Inspector Sha Ningshi, and his vacancy was filled by Xu Jingsheng, the director of the city district Public Security Bureau. Xu's vacancy was filled by Shen Shike, the director of the Public Security Section, who also took over. The leader of the Detective Group, Zhang Meiqing, was dismissed and replaced by someone named Zhang. For a time, public opinion was unanimous. It is also rumored that other administrative improvements will be announced in the short term.</p>
<h3>Guanyun</h3>
<p>Grave of Geng Gong of the Han Dynasty Discovered</p>
<p>Wang Chao, a farmer in the Second Bao of Huanghe Township, Sixth District of Guanyun, is 34 years old and his family is quite wealthy. Yesterday, Wang was building several new houses because his existing house was not enough to live in. When digging the foundation, he unearthed an ancient coffin with mottled vermilion lacquer and the words "Grave of Sima Geng Gong of the Han Dynasty" written in gold on the lid. Seeing the unearthed ancient coffin, Wang ordered the workers to fill the soil back in.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Opening of the Literature Exhibition</p>
<p>The Yin County Literature Committee was ordered to organize a literature exhibition. Preparations have been underway for more than a month. It is now ready and opened on the 1st, with exhibits displayed in six locations. It is said that the calligraphy, paintings, and antiques collected this time are all rare and precious items that are a feast for the eyes. In particular, the simultaneous opening of Tianyige is an unprecedented event. Tianyige was the book collection of Fan Yaoqing, the Secretary of the Ministry of Rites, during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty. The book collection is famous at home and abroad, and the regulations are strict and it is not open to the public. This time, Fan's descendants, for the sake of great righteousness, resolutely broke the precedent and opened it for four days, which is truly a joyous event for the academic community.</p>
<h3>Bengbu</h3>
<p>Huinan Railway Issues Joint Tickets</p>
<p>The Huainan Railway has organized a joint Huaihe River transport service, approved by the Construction Committee. It has already implemented the issuance of joint train-boat tickets, with Tianjia'an as the central transfer point. The Huaihe River Shipping Cooperative is equipped with tugboats to carry passengers and goods, traveling to various docks such as Zhengyangguan, Shouxian, Fengtai, Luohe, Huangtunyuan, Matoucheng, Huaiyuan, and Bengbu. For convenience, the railway stations and docks along the line are responsible for direct transportation of passengers and goods. For goods transported to Hefei and Wuhu, the railway can issue bills of lading, which merchants can use to borrow money from banks. Furthermore, once merchants contact the railway station to handle freight, they do not need to go through others, saving expenses. The Huaihe River Railway's Bengbu Office for Joint Transport is located within the Huaihe River Shipping Cooperative. The Huainan Coal Mining Bureau has specially appointed Lin Dianqin to be stationed in Bengbu to oversee guidance. Chen Ruchen, the director of Bengbu, Yao Minzhai, the director of Zhengyang, and Ye Qizhong, the director of Tianjia'an, have all been appointed. The Lishang small steamer and Huixing diesel ship, newly purchased by the Huaihe River Shipping Cooperative from Zhenjiang, are expected to arrive in Bengbu and join the joint transport service within days. The recent business development is showing a flourishing trend.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Guangdong and Guangxi - Financial Condition of Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Xiao'an</p>
<p>Since the changes in the Guangdong situation, the financial condition of Guangdong Province has also changed accordingly. Those in charge of finance first implemented a ban on gambling by order, and at the same time abolished various harsh and miscellaneous taxes, hoping to make a new start with the people. It is found that the largest sources of income in Guangdong Province each year are gambling taxes and land taxes. Gambling taxes, such as fan-tan and lottery tickets, amounted to more than 20,082,000 yuan according to the income calculation for the 23rd and 24th years of the Republic. With the implementation of the gambling ban, this huge income has ceased. Regarding the land tax, Chen Jitang had already abolished it and switched to a land value tax. However, since the tax was newly established, the procedures were very complicated, and few people complied. Moreover, the personnel handling the collection of the tax were neither experienced nor capable, nor did they know much about the land tax situation. Therefore, although the tax has been implemented, the income has been minimal. Due to these two items, the financial situation of Guangdong Province is showing difficulties. However, the financial authorities are planning to make a new start with the people, so the plan to abolish harsh and miscellaneous taxes must be implemented at the same time. Those in charge of abolishing harsh and miscellaneous taxes are the Review Committee for Abolishing Harsh and Miscellaneous Taxes attached to the Department of Finance. All harsh and miscellaneous taxes that should be abolished are reviewed by the committee one by one, and the steps for abolition are determined. It has been found that more than ten types of taxes have already been abolished, including rice tax, machine tax, house tax, fishing tax, cement surtax, Foshan theater surtax, Taishan County gray brick surtax, Lianjiang live pig export tax, and Qiongyai live pig export tax. In addition, there are still those awaiting review and abolition. The total number of harsh and miscellaneous taxes expected to be abolished is often over one million yuan. It is found that the approximate number of annual income and expenditure in Guangdong Province in the past was more than 54,700,000 yuan for income, and more than 65,200,000 yuan for regular and temporary expenses. Originally, income and expenditure did not balance. With the implementation of the gambling ban, the annual income has obviously decreased by 20,000,000 yuan, coupled with the poor performance of land tax income and the successive abolition of harsh and miscellaneous taxes. Therefore, the financial aspect feels particularly strained. Although the financial authorities have submitted a request to the central government to issue 120,000,000 yuan in public bonds, its purpose is to reorganize finance, and the issuance of public bonds must go through considerable procedures, which is also not easy to provide emergency relief. Minister Song's several visits to Minister Kong are probably related to this. It is rumored that the provincial government had previously been ordered to build a highway between the Northwest and Two Rivers to facilitate transportation. The estimated cost of construction is 2,000,000 yuan, and it is planned to be completed in a short time. The provincial government meeting decided to build it in stages, and the first phase was approved to allocate 500,000 yuan, which was to be paid by the Department of Finance. However, as a result, the Department of Finance only allocated 50,000 yuan due to its extreme financial difficulties. From this, one can infer that the financial situation of Guangdong Province is not as good as before. Under this difficult situation, the financial authorities are making efforts to tighten up spending. For example, the internal organization of the Department of Finance, which was originally divided into six sections, has now been changed to three sections, and the number of personnel has also been slightly reduced. Moreover, the various agencies under the jurisdiction of the provincial government are more strictly implementing staff reduction and streamlining administration, and will also ask the central government to provide subsidies within the possible scope, so that the financial vitality can be restored as soon as possible. Generally speaking, it will take a long time for the financial outlook to be optimistic.</p>
<p>The implementation of the silver dollar system is also an important issue in the financial aspect of Guangdong Province. Guangdong Province has always been a province with a small silver dollar system. All businesses in the province use small silver dollars, and foreign trade is based on Hong Kong currency. Except for national tax authorities, the industrial and commercial sectors hardly know about silver dollars. Now that the government has announced that Guangdong Province will implement the silver dollar system, all sectors are very concerned. Since there are no silver dollars in the pockets of all sectors, if the small silver dollars are exchanged for silver dollars, there will be a considerable loss during the transition. Therefore, at the beginning of this problem, the Chamber of Commerce collected opinions from all sectors, and all advocated that the exchange rate of small silver dollars for silver dollars should not exceed three percent. This is to hope that the government will cherish the devastation suffered by the people of Guangdong Province in the past and hope that the losses will be slightly smaller when the silver dollar system is implemented. However, the government's final decision was 4.8 percent, which is far from the hopes of all sectors. Moreover, the market price is often outside of 4.91 percent, and even government agencies such as courts, post offices, and the Guangdong-Hankou Railway are set at 5 percent, that is, only 150 yuan of Guangdong currency can be exchanged for 100 yuan of silver dollars. Government agencies are so non-compliant with the law. Therefore, the pain of losses felt by all sectors is deepening day by day, and the commerce between Shanghai and Guangdong has also been affected. At present, the general public is quite disappointed with the 4.8 percent rate set by the government, and is particularly resentful of the government agencies that receive 5 percent. Some say that the government has pointed out that the small silver dollar fund in Guangdong Province is insufficient, and it has to be set at 4.8 percent. In fact, there is still a lot of silver in the interior of Guangdong Province. It is estimated that only one-third of the silver in the province was collected during the Chen Jitang era, and the remaining two-thirds, if the government actively collects it to fill the legal tender fund, it should also be very substantial. Others say that the excessive issuance of small silver dollars in the past was due to the mismanagement of the Chen Jitang era. Now, the implementation of the silver dollar system, which stipulates that small silver dollars are calculated at 4.8 percent, is a loss for the common people. Under the circumstances of the government trying to win over the people and make them embrace the central government, it should also accept the Chamber of Commerce and all sectors' proposal of three percent, which will help increase the harmony between the top and bottom. Some even say that the small silver dollars in Guangdong Province are indeed paper, and the central government's silver dollar notes are also paper. In Guangdong, a province that is not a silver dollar system, if you want to promote the silver dollar smoothly, you should especially give the people of Guangdong a loss that is not too great under the original circumstances. Although these arguments are not based on correct theory, it can be seen that the general public's opinion on the implementation of the silver dollar system and there is obviously some resentment. In order to stabilize the finances of Guangdong Province, the government seems not to ignore this issue.</p>

<h3>Schools Subsidized by the Municipal Council, After Relocation of School Site</h3>
<p>Should Notify as Soon as Possible for Verification</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of whether private schools in the Public Concession that receive subsidies from the Municipal Council can continue to receive subsidies after the relocation of the school site, the Municipal Council Board of Directors has accepted the suggestion of the Education Committee and issued a notice yesterday, stating that the Municipal Council's issuance of subsidies is only based on whether the existing school buildings, equipment, etc., meet the conditions of the various departments of the Municipal Council. Therefore, once a school has moved into a new site, the subsidy should automatically stop. Therefore, all subsidized schools should notify the Municipal Council as soon as possible after the relocation, so that the relevant departments of the Municipal Council can go to verify in advance. The unpaid part of the subsidy and the future subsidy applied for will be determined according to the situation of the new school building and the cost of construction and renovation, or the improvement of the old school building.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Improves the Accounting System for Provincial and County Education Institutions</h3>
<p>In recent years, Jiangsu Province has improved the methods for managing funds of various educational institutions, that is, the determination of the accounting system, and has formulated implementation measures to standardize the accounting subjects and types of books and records of various institutions. It also stipulates the procedures for the use of funds and the regulations for the submission of final accounts in accordance with scientific methods. Furthermore, it identifies and trains accounting personnel of various institutions to ensure that all educational institutions manage their finances in a scientific manner under the same system. At the same time, the competent authorities conduct precise assessments of the financial situation of their subordinate institutions at any time. In recent years, this plan has been gradually implemented and this work has been designated as one of the central tasks. There are more comprehensive regulations in terms of methods and systems, and the implementation is supervised. In April of last year, the Jiangsu Provincial Audit Office was established, which provides more rigorous supervision over the use and management of funds of various institutions. The recent progress is as follows: (1) "Regulations on Budget Subjects": In the past, there were no clear regulations on the budget subjects of educational institutions in Jiangsu Province. The increase or decrease of subjects was at the discretion of the accounting staff. Not only was there a difference between this institution and that institution, but the subjects used in each year of the same institution were also inconsistent. The expenditure of various expenses lacked a unified jurisdiction and was arbitrary, which not only confused the actual situation of revenue and expenditure, but also made the regulations on the standards for budget allocation equivalent to empty words. In view of this, the Education Department has formulated budget subjects in accordance with the regulations of the central government, taking into account the nature of the payment of educational institutions, distinguishing between items and sections, and adding explanations and examples to ensure that all expenditures have a definite jurisdiction and that there is a strict basis for accounting and reimbursement. This is not only more accurate in terms of auditing, but also has precise boundaries in terms of statistics and comparison. These regulations have now been implemented in earnest, and it is certain that the improvement of accounting administration is of great significance. (2) "Unified Bookkeeping": There were no unified regulations on the accounting books and reports used by the accounting departments of educational institutions in Jiangsu Province, which caused much inconvenience in auditing and assessing. Starting from last year, accounting regulations were formulated, and the formats and types of bookkeeping began to be standardized. Based on the principle of simplicity and clarity, and the complexity of the institution's personnel affairs, a common set of accounting books was developed, which not only provides accurate records of financial income and expenditure, but also provides clear records of the increase or decrease of property and goods. Last year was the guidance implementation period, and this year is the supervision and assessment period. The accounting books of various institutions will be electronically reviewed at any time and personnel will be sent to conduct on-site inspections. The results of the implementation are generally satisfactory. (3) Revising the Procedures for Expenditure of Funds and the Measures for Submitting Final Accounts: An educational institution is a public undertaking, and the authority of the authorities to handle finances should be managed in accordance with the provisions of laws and regulations, and the managers should each bear their respective responsibilities. In order to clarify the boundaries of each person's responsibility and facilitate supervision, the power to review and allocate funds, the responsibility for disbursement and safekeeping, and the procedures for auditing have all been specifically stipulated. Recently, in accordance with the regulations of the provincial government, specific instructions have been given on the deadlines, procedures, formats, and points to be noted for submitting reports and vouchers, and strict audits have been carried out at the same time to determine the responsibilities of responsible personnel. (4) "Identifying and Training Accounting Personnel": In order to improve the school accounting system in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry, the Education Department first sent accountants to the provincial vocational schools in the 22nd year [of the Republic] for trial implementation. After successful implementation, it was promoted to various schools. Starting in the 23rd year [of the Republic], in order to select true talents, an open selection examination was held, and the qualified personnel were assigned to different positions for a two-year trial period, which proved to be effective. Starting in the 25th year [of the Republic], the provincial social education institutions were also changed to accountants sent by the Education Department. First, an examination was held in the 24th year [of the Republic], and the selected personnel were given two months of training before being assigned to different positions. At the same time, accounting personnel from various county education bureaus were also selected in batches and qualified personnel were recruited and trained. After the training period, they were assigned to positions. The above is the recent important work of Jiangsu Province in improving the accounting system of provincial and county education institutions. The purpose is to enable all educational institutions in the province to manage their funds in a scientific manner under a unified system, so that the administrative authorities can conduct rigorous assessments at any time.</p>

After the opening, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation took the opportunity to close, and the banks were still doing business. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's official price announcement showed no change in both British and American [currency], and it remained hovering. After entering, the white silver balance tax rose by half a fen [currency unspecified], which also had little impact. Although Sassoon bought, it remained stable.

<h3>Securities: The Government Bond Market Has Relatively Eased</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange showed a relatively eased situation due to the circumstances in this port. The surface appearance was no longer as urgent as the previous day. The market price had fallen sharply for several days in a row. A sudden rise in the wind was a matter of intention. However, upon closer examination, all measures were extremely tense and could not be traced within a short period of time. What is expected at present is that the transition to a formal diplomatic track will avoid a breakdown. The transmitted non-insurance of military risk and non-mortgage of funds are necessary paths, but it is too early to say so. Therefore, it is difficult to hold an optimistic outlook for the future of the debt market. Yesterday's experience showed that the opening market was strong. The E-type [government bond] of this month, which was first auctioned, rose sharply by one yuan and two jiao [currency unspecified] because it had fallen the most on the previous day. People's hearts were therefore even more firm, and the market price rose uniformly. Only the B-type [government bond] of this month rose the most on the previous closing day, so it only rose slightly by one jiao [currency unspecified]. On average, the prices were at the balance of high and low. Among the buyers, the number four, number ten, and number eleven [brokers] were the most. Although numbers ten and eleven sold before the settlement, causing a slight relaxation, numbers thirty-two and fifty-three and others greatly compensated for it, and the trend suddenly changed. A-type [government bond] suddenly increased by four jiao [currency unspecified]. After the afternoon opening, the news was dull. The number four [broker] and retail demand were still strong. E-type [government bond] rose another five and a half jiao [currency unspecified]. The market was the cornerstone of this and the market atmosphere was extremely stable, increasing by three or four jiao [currency unspecified] uniformly. The return wind rose and connected to a good market. The increase had returned to one yuan and several jiao [currency unspecified]. Before the end of the Sino-Japanese negotiations, the increase seemed too strong. At the closing, number sixteen suddenly came with a large number of sales, and the market price gradually became unsustainable. Starting with C-type [government bond], the trend had softened and gradually shifted downstream. A-type [government bond] suddenly returned to a small three-point-half [currency unspecified], and the situation was quite chaotic. As a result, the market price rose by five and a half jiao [currency unspecified] to one yuan and three and a half jiao [currency unspecified]. Nine-six [another bond type] also increased by four to five jiao [currency unspecified] at best. The total number of transactions was 15,390,000 yuan [currency unspecified]. The results of the increase and decrease are listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan [currency unspecified]; transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Introduction to the New Book "On Pawnbroking"</h3>
<p>—By Mi Gonggan—</p>
<p>Pawnbroking is "the poor man's back door." Under such social circumstances, when three meals a day are not assured and "there's nowhere to strike fire from a brick," if one has some broken belongings, they can still seek a loan from a pawnbroker to barely get by. Therefore, before the poor have access to adequate alternative organizations, the position of pawnbroking should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>However, the pawnbroking system, after being battered by the tides of economic panic and severely affected by rural bankruptcy, is "in a precarious state." Moreover, pawnbrokers' assistants, sitting inside the pawnshop all day long, are the most conservative. Therefore, to maintain its business, the only way is reform. Thus, I express my deep agreement with Mr. Mi Gonggan's book "On Pawnbroking." Without thorough investigation and research, how could a good plan be compiled? Only with this model, the pawnbroking industry has a hope of reform, hence I introduce it with enthusiasm. Editor</p>

<h3>Yarn Flowers: Yarn Flower Prices Plummet Like a Rabbit Leaping and a Falcon Swooping, Rising Vigorously After Noon Due to Profit-Taking</h3>
<p>The yarn market is volatile, with the situation becoming increasingly chaotic. This is largely due to the recent proliferation of rumors in the market, leading to unsettled sentiment. Prices fluctuate rapidly and significantly. Both bullish and bearish positions have seen a considerable increase in stakes, resulting in even faster changes. Even when prices are high, there are many sellers. It is difficult to predict what the future holds.</p>
<p>Lack of Sellers in the Futures Market After Initial Bids</p>
<p>At the opening of futures trading, prices rose slightly due to the significant declines of the previous day. However, after the first round of trading, due to unfavorable conditions, large bullish players continued to unload their positions, causing a significant loosening of the market. The market found it increasingly difficult to sustain itself. At the same time, spot yarn transactions were not as active as before, leading to a surge of sellers and a sharp drop in market prices. Concord, Prosperity, Benefit, Chang, and other major bullish players were all cutting their losses. However, Auspicious Prosperity, Abundant Greatness, Jin Chang, Ming De, Zhen Da, and Qin Chang also bought heavily. As a result, prices for all months fell by 1.7 to 2.45 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. At the opening of afternoon trading, the market tightened due to profit-taking by bearish players, and prices gradually rebounded. By the close of trading, it was said that news had improved, and sellers were scarce, causing the trend to become increasingly bullish. As a result, prices for all months rose by 1.7 to 2.6 yuan compared to the morning's closing price. Dafu sold 1,300 bales, Concord sold 1,050 bales, Yuan Yi sold 1,150 bales, Yi Chang sold 2,300 bales, Da Chang sold 1,400 bales, Fu Kang sold 2,050 bales, Jin Chang sold 1,200 bales, Sen Kang sold 1,150 bales, and Shen Zhu sold 2,550 bales. Auspicious Prosperity bought 1,050 bales, Yu Da bought 2,850 bales, Ming De bought 3,200 bales, Zhen Da bought 1,400 bales, Feng Tai bought 1,850 bales, Geng Feng bought 1,950 bales, Chang Feng bought 5,950 bales, and Xie Cheng bought 1,100 bales. The highest and lowest prices for January are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Slight Decline in Spot Yarn Sales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were slightly sluggish. A total of 985 bales were purchased by various groups throughout the day, with prices falling by 1.2 yuan for yarn and 3.4 yuan for thread. The purchase amounts by various groups are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 215 Mainland 245 Jiangxi 350</p>
<p>Xuzhou 45 Hankou 5 Fellow Traders 25</p>
<p>Yunnan 100</p>
<p>The cotton market plummeted in the morning, and market sentiment was particularly depressed. In the afternoon, bearish players suddenly covered their positions, causing the market to tighten. Buyers rushed in like swarms of bees, and the rising trend became intense. However, many bullish players had already unloaded their positions.</p>
<p>Table Cotton: Falls in the Morning, Recovers in the Afternoon</p>
<p>At the opening of table cotton futures trading, recent prices were slightly higher, while distant months remained unchanged. After the first round of trading, the market stabilized. By the third round of bidding, the market situation changed rapidly. It was said that banks required insurance for cotton pledges before they could be accepted. As a result, rumors spread rapidly, and the October contract plummeted by 7.5 points, breaking the 9-yuan mark. Distant months fell below the 40-yuan threshold. The reason for this was mainly profit-taking by general bullish players. Heng Yi, Dafu, Concord, Run Kang, Chang He, and Fu Kang sold heavily, while Ju Xing, Da Feng, Heng Chang, Sheng Yuan, and Yu Da also bought heavily. As a result, prices for all months fell by 0.35 to 0.67 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. At the opening of afternoon trading, market conditions were good, and bearish players again covered their positions, pushing prices higher step by step. As a result, prices for all months rose by 0.45 to 0.65 yuan compared to the morning's closing price. Da Feng sold 2,900 loads, Dafu sold 3,400 loads, Heng Yi sold 5,400 loads, Concord sold 5,200 loads, Run Kang sold 9,800 loads, Fu Kang sold 3,300 loads, Chang He sold 11,400 loads, Tong He sold 1,800 loads, and Xin Cheng sold 5,200 loads. Ju Xing bought 4,000 loads, Da Feng bought 5,100 loads, Jin Chang bought 3,100 loads, Geng Feng bought 14,400 loads, Shen Chang bought 2,500 loads, Jin Yu bought 2,500 loads, Sheng Yuan bought 2,600 loads, Yu Da bought 3,900 loads, Ming De bought 6,000 loads, and Yuan Xing Chang bought 2,600 loads. The highest and lowest prices, as well as closing prices, for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Both Arrivals and Sales of Spot Cotton are Strong</p>
<p>Arrivals and sales of spot cotton are both strong. Consumption of spot cotton remains good, but factory demand is slightly sluggish. The sources were 2,180 bales of Yao cotton and 1,860 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<h3>Continued Good Conditions in the English Cotton Market</h3>
<p>—Greatly Benefiting American Cotton—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with good news from Liverpool. Demand for cloth continued to be strong, spot cotton exports improved, and prices were relatively firm, rising by 1 to 6 points per pound for all months. Subsequently, bullish players liquidated their positions, and short selling increased. With favorable weather in the South, buyers waited quietly for private estimates and the government report to be released on the 8th. Market conditions weakened. Before closing, traders bought heavily, and short sellers also covered their positions. Spot prices rose by 1 point per pound, and futures prices rose by 1 to 3 points per pound. The weather forecast for tonight is mostly good, with some clouds and rain in the eastern part, smooth conditions in the central part, and some clouds in the western part. English spot cotton rose by 9 points, and futures rose by 5 to 7 points. Indian cotton was heavily purchased by Japanese merchants, and there was also demand from mainland exporters and cloth merchants. Subsequently, short sellers dumped their positions, and bullish players liquidated, causing the market to slightly recover. Ping Gu Er rose by half a rupee, Ao Mu La rose by 1.25 rupees, and Bai Luo Xi rose by 0.75 rupees. Original telegram recorded on the left. (One-day telegram)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 2nd was: Bai Luo Xi at 211 rupees, the same as the previous day; Ao Mu La at 199 rupees, up 0.25 rupees; Ping Gu Er at 157 rupees, down 0.25 rupees.</p>
<p>Three Grades of Yarn and Flowers: Osaka Telegram on the 2nd: Three grades of yarn futures rose by 0.4 yuan to fall by 0.2 yuan, with near-term contracts at 215 yuan and distant-term contracts at 207.4 yuan. Cotton futures fell by 0.15 yuan to rise by 0.4 yuan, with near-term contracts at 66.85 yuan and distant-term contracts at 67.1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Decrease in Yarn and Cloth Warehouse Inventory</h3>
<p>According to the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange, the total yarn inventory in warehouses, as of the most recent count, was 21,840 bales. Among them, six brands—20s Flying Boat, Red Kui Xing, Xin Jin Cheng, Double Deer, Waking Lion, and Three Stars—still had inventories ranging from over 2,000 bales to 3,100, 200, and 300 bales. The details of the yarn inventory are as follows (unit: yuan):</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Shortage of Spot Cotton Cloth Persists</h3>
<p>Continuous Replenishment from Guangdong, Yunnan, Sichuan, and Fujian; Demand Along the Longhai Railway Eases</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw stable prices due to the fall and subsequent rise in yarn and flower prices. Spot goods in the market remained scarce. However, it was reported that demand in various areas along the Longhai Railway had slowed down slightly due to insufficient vehicles from the Railway Bureau, which led to delays in the transportation of goods. Selling prices remained firm, and transactions were not active. Futures and warehouse receipts were sold at slightly looser prices, and manufacturers were quite interested in selling long-term futures, but the market showed little interest, preferring to absorb spot goods. Shipments from Guangdong, Yunnan, Sichuan, and Fujian continued to be strong. Guangdong groups were shipping fine twills, coarse cloth, and patterned goods, including Zhigong, thread wool, etc. Sichuan groups were shipping mainly floral velvet-colored twills and blue cloth. In addition to shipping Zhigong broadcloth orders, Yunnan groups also shipped about 200 pieces of goods, including Shilin cloth, large red velvet, printed velvet, 1.6-foot velvet, coarse cloth, and thread wool. Intermittent purchases were also strong, with the most urgent demand being for broadcloth and thread wool.</p>
<h3>Head Scarf Wool with Western Lettering is Particularly Popular</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wool market saw brisk sales. There was continued buying interest in herringbone wool, riding breeches wool, Polish wool, clothing wool, head scarf wool, women's colored wool, etc. Head scarf wool with Western lettering on the edges was particularly popular. However, inventories in Shanghai were extremely scarce. Top-quality items were wholesaling for 12-13 yuan per yard, and even ordinary items required around 8 yuan. Those priced around 7 yuan had already been snapped up by the Western-style clothing industry. As a result, even head scarf wool with lettering priced around 8 yuan was very popular. Market sentiment was exceptionally strong, and prices were rising gradually.</p>
<h3>Grains: Wheat Flour Falls Again in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat flour market, after opening in the morning, showed an initial weakness, then stabilized, and finally fell again. The quoted prices for imported wheat continued to be slightly down by 0.8 of a cent in Chicago and up by 2.0 cents in Canada. Therefore, market sentiment was weak at the opening. However, starting from November, outside investment increased due to the temporary easing of concerns over the Sino-Japanese issue, and buying interest revived. Prices for all months were nearly a cent higher than the previous day. When trading resumed in the afternoon, the near-term months saw a renewed decline due to rumors of a serious situation in North China, which made people anxious again. Therefore, the near-term months fell by 1-2 cents, while the February-March months remained stable. Subsequent developments will depend on how the situation evolves.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Trading is Very Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market was generally stable for all months at the opening in the morning, as imported wheat prices showed little fluctuation and there was no clarification of the future situation. Therefore, trading in all months was generally stagnant. However, due to the scarcity of sellers, asking prices were raised by about 0.2-0.3 of a cent. When trading resumed in the afternoon, trading was even less active. Due to the sluggishness of the flour market and numerous rumors, near-term and distant-term prices fell by 0.2-0.3 of a cent. As the future situation is unpredictable, it is feared that trading will not develop easily. In the spot wheat market, factories were unanimously watching the situation and were not eager to buy. Only about 400-500 bags were transacted, with the highest price still being 0.3 yuan, and medium-quality goods being sold at lower prices.</p>
<h3>Rice Sales Are Active and Prices Mostly Rise</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over 20 firms arrived with a total of over 4,000 shi of goods from various sources. Sales were even more active. Dalian and Yantai groups also purchased over 400 bags of new Bo Ge and other thin indica rice varieties. Therefore, the market situation immediately improved with the scarcity of arrivals. As a result, the price of Bo Ge continued to rise by 0.3 yuan, while the increase in the price of thick new japonica rice was particularly strong, rising by as much as 0.4 yuan. Du Jian also increased by 0.1-0.2 yuan. The price of Yang Jian was raised by 0.2-0.3 yuan due to the lack of goods. Looking at the trend in the future, if the source of arrivals remains scarce, it seems likely that prices will continue to rise. Chen Bian Yuan's price has been flat since the sudden surge in the previous market, with no gains or losses. Although there were many arrivals of Xin Yin Yuan, sales were also good, resulting in a stable but tight situation in the market.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the arrival of goods from various ports in Hebei was not strong, with only 26-27 firms. Due to the panic, sales of various goods in the market were quite good. However, Bian Yuan was lackluster. The market situation saw high-quality japonica rise by 0.1 yuan, medium-quality rising by 0.2-0.3 yuan, new indica rising by 0.2-0.4 yuan, Chen Yang Jian rising by 0.3-0.4 yuan, Xin Yang Du Jian rising by 0.2-0.3 yuan, Xin Bu Ke Jian also rising by 0.3-0.4 yuan, and Yao Zhong rising by 0.2-0.3 yuan. Bian Qian Yuan stood firm. Jiashan white rice was launched on the market, opening at 9.52 yuan.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Groups Resumed Buying Customers' Indica Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for customer's indica rice initially weakened and then rose. At the opening in the morning, the decline in the buying of this customer's product was soft, and rumors continued, unifying the market towards a downward trend. The owners of the goods universally competed to lower prices in order to sell off, and the market once fell by 0.25 yuan to nearly 0.1 yuan. After the lower prices, suddenly a large Guangdong group revived its buying activity, and the Shantou and local traders were also interested, with a slight interest also from the mainland, and the market was extremely active. The Guangdong group bought thousands of bags of brown rice, and the Shantou and local traders also revived their buying of over 10,000 bags of rice from various mills. The market price immediately improved by nearly 0.1 yuan. The overall market offered over 6,000 bags of Jiangxi rice, 7,000 bags of Hunan rice, and 10,000 bags of Han brown rice.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Sea Cucumber Supply Barely Meets Demand</h3>
<p>The supply of sea cucumber from various sources remains very scarce, resulting in a shortage of goods on the market and soaring prices. Due to customer demand, there are times when goods cannot be supplied, so merchants' selling prices continue to rise. For example, Western old port red bottom boot sea cucumber has been out of stock for a long time. New port red boot sea cucumber is currently priced at 188 yuan for 6 pieces, 178 yuan for 8 pieces, 150 yuan for 12-14 pieces, 170 yuan for 6-8 pieces of North Sea boot, 155 yuan for 8 pieces, 102-98 yuan for 12 pieces of Duck Pier white boot, 310 yuan for 2-3 pieces of Jinshan top black wrinkle, 280 yuan for 4-5 pieces, 240 yuan for 6-8 pieces of Wang Fan Xi Zheng Lu black yuan, 220 yuan for 8 pieces, 207 yuan for 10 pieces, 196 yuan for 12 pieces. Old goods of Dongjin Tenth Grade Sea Cucumber are generally available, but new goods are rarely arriving, and Nemuro goods are particularly scarce. The current selling price for 35 pieces is 345 yuan, 330 yuan for 40 pieces, 320 yuan for 50 pieces, 310 yuan for 60 pieces, 342 yuan for 30 pieces of Zeng Mao goods, 330 yuan for 35 pieces, 300 yuan for 40 pieces, 295 yuan for 45 pieces, 288 yuan for 50 pieces, 284 yuan for 55 pieces, 277 yuan for 60 pieces, 303 yuan for 32 pieces of Soya goods, 306 yuan for 45 pieces, 298 yuan for 60 pieces, 278 yuan for 72 pieces, 270 yuan for 32 pieces of fine-skinned Bajia ginseng, 242 yuan for coarse-skinned. The market price at Baige Bridge is 20-30 yuan to 40-50 yuan higher than ten days ago. Customers are willing to bear the high prices to purchase, so transactions have not decreased. According to industry insiders, if the arrival of goods does not increase, there is a possibility that prices will continue to rise in the future.</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea: Lyon Silk Prices Suddenly Soar</h3>
<p>Affected by the Franc's Depreciation</p>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silk markets saw Lyon prices surge due to the depreciation of the French franc. Japanese raw silk manufacturers in France suddenly raised their prices by 13.50 francs, with each kilogram of silk priced at 80 francs (compared to 66.50 francs the previous day). Due to market confusion, Shanghai silk (AB grades) and Guangdong silk had no market prices. Yokohama and New York markets were weaker. Sino-Japanese raw silk prices in New York fell by one cent across the board, except for Guangdong silk, which maintained its original price. Exchange sales fell by 2.5 cents in the near term and 0.5 cents in the deferred term. Yokohama futures were unchanged, and spot prices were slightly down by 2 yuan. The local silk market remained sluggish, with few transactions from foreign firms and users. As a result, silk prices tended to weaken, with market prices generally falling by about 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Increased Raw Silk Imports in New York</h3>
<p>According to Reuters, the New York raw silk inventory and sales report showed that raw silk imports increased in March due to the peak season for unloading goods. However, only 80 loads of Shanghai silk were exported to the US, and no Guangdong silk was exported because the Guangdong and Guangxi issues had just been resolved at that time. Japanese silk increased by 2,957 loads, and European and Italian silk increased by 698 loads. The details of their inventory and sales are listed below.</p>
<h3>Some Sales of Needle-Eyebrow Green Tea</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market remained quiet. Only a few firms in the city, such as Ying Zhuang, Xie He, and Li Fu, bought over 500 boxes of Lu Zhuang Ping Shui Needle-Eyebrow green tea at a price of 2.34 yuan. Sales of Treasure Eyebrow green tea were extremely sluggish, mainly because the depreciation of the French franc made foreign prices much higher than before, and the unstable situation also made people pessimistic. Other items, such as Gong Xi Pearl Tea, were also deserted.</p>
<p>According to the Tea Warehouse Industry Association, the green tea market has made no progress since the Mid-Autumn Festival. Foreign firms are worried that the depreciation of the French franc will greatly affect market prices, but buyers have not indicated any interest, and there have been few transactions only for low-grade Gong Zhu and Xiu Mei teas. The market seems to be temporarily stalled.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Dutch Coarse White Spot Rises by 1 Dime</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market remained firm, but transactions inevitably decreased due to the situation. The guild set the price for 24 Coarse Sand White spot at 21.75 yuan, up 1 dime; transit high-grade goods at 6.5 yuan, and ordinary at 6.4 yuan; Dong White spot up about 1 dime, No. 4 at 21.6 yuan, No. 8 at 21.3 yuan, with no other changes. Mian White from local factories, such as Zhen Ji, Da Hua, and Jin Xin No. 1, were all at 20.5 yuan. Only Guang groups opened a hundred or so bags of Zhu Qing grade goods at 13.2 yuan.</p>
<p>The Joint Company held its third bidding session this week for Guangdong sugar, with a total quota of 7,234 bags. Bidding prices were the same as before. 100 bags of Wu Yang Coarse White from the Shunde factory were sold at 21.5 yuan, and 200 bags from the Shi Xin factory and You factory were sold at 21.3 yuan. 500 bags from the Shantou factory and You Gao Zhuang were sold at 21.2 yuan, with 100 bags sold at 21.1 yuan and 250 bags sold at 20.9 yuan. A total of 1,150 bags were sold.</p>
<h3>Metals: High Demand for Garden Wire Mesh</h3>
<p>Garden wire mesh (commonly known as wire netting) has seen a recent surge in trading. It is estimated that over the past two days, 4,000-5,000 bundles have been put on the market. However, since the goods have been purchased, they have been out of stock, and standards have soared. The initial market price was 1.25 yuan per bundle, which then gradually increased to between 4.1 and 4.2 yuan, and finally rose to 4.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The new wire business is also very good. Colors such as No. 11, No. 14, and No. 16 that are common in the market have also been nearly sold out. Prices have increased by 0.5-0.6 yuan compared to before. The prices of other colors have not changed because of little real sales.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News: Three Nai Price Rises by Four Yuan in Shantou</h3>
<p>Shantou telegram reports that the price of three Nai has jumped by four yuan due to a shortage of goods. Local goods have also been inspected and are not as abundant. Following the tight market, the price may continue to rise.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Urges Citizens Not to Believe Rumors and Relocate: Situation in Hongkou and Zhabei Eases Again Yesterday; Wire Mesh on North Sichuan Road Removed</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the situation in the Hongkou and Zhabei areas returned to normal yesterday. The Japanese military's wire mesh on the main intersections of North Sichuan Road has been removed. Japanese military posts on Jiangwan Road and Tongji Road have been deployed and removed intermittently. However, the area east of the extraterritorial roads, around the Tiantong Road and Xiangyan Bridge area, still feels unsafe. The Municipal Public Security Bureau has specifically posted announcements on various roads to reassure the public and dissuade them from relocating. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Wire Mesh Removed</p>
<p>Starting from the early morning of the day before yesterday, the Japanese military erected wire mesh at various key intersections on North Sichuan Road and Lao Bazi Road, Haining Road, Kunshan Road, Peng Road, Wuchang Road, and Tiantong Road, and expanded patrol posts to Suzhou Road and the Suzhou River. The wire mesh was completely removed yesterday morning. However, the deployed posts and scattered soldiers or organized vehicles patrolling are still present on the Suzhou River, but their numbers seem to be slightly reduced compared to the previous day. The Japanese Club on Peng Road was left with only one truck and one post yesterday.</p>
<p>Three Garrison Posts Discovered</p>
<p>It was previously known that the Japanese Marines' defense posts in the concession were only located at North Sichuan Road, the Xingjiaqiao Pier, the Yongfeng Building, and the Western-style house at No. 504 Diss Will Road, at its junction with Aigmei Road. Xin Sheng News Agency reporters discovered three more yesterday: one at No. 699 Feilen Road, at its junction with Tang En Road; one at No. 400 Miller Road, north of Minhang Road; and another at No. 83, the southern section of Miller Road. Each had an armored vehicle, a military truck, a motorcycle, and one or two cars for military officers parked in front of them. The Japanese military's patrols in the area bordering Diss Will Road and the extraterritorial road in eastern Hongkou seem to be centered around these three defense posts.</p>
<p>Jiangwan Road Still Safe</p>
<p>As for Zhabei, the Jiangwan Road area is still peaceful. There are only a few permanent Japanese military posts in the extraterritorial road section adjacent to Hongkou Park, south of the railway. The Japanese military also sent posts to Tongji Road, the intersection of Jiangwan Road, and Hengye Road, but they were deployed and removed intermittently, as before, three times: from 7:00 AM to 8:30 AM, from 11:00 AM to 12:30 PM, and from 2:30 PM to 4:00 PM. During the remaining time, they were all removed, but from time to time, groups of five or six or eight or nine people patrolled various places. The Japanese military at the Tan House Brewery in the open area at the end of Garden Street behind the 63 Garden had no special movements other than sending posts to the above-mentioned places. Three to five people remained at the Japanese cemetery slightly south of Baziqiao, and it was very quiet.</p>
<p>Xiangyan Bridge Relatively Tense</p>
<p>However, the area in eastern Zhabei, from the intersection of Ouyang Road and Xiangde Road, south to the intersection of Qimei Road and Diss Will Road, east to the Tiantong Road bridge on Tiantong Road and the Xiangyan Bridge on the Lao Xiangyan Bridge Road, and the East Sports Association Road and the Qimei Road area, is still filled with Japanese military posts, which have not been removed until late at night. Scattered soldiers and organized vehicles patrol frequently, so the situation in that area is more tense. A large number of residents had previously moved to the concession, but after the Municipal Public Security Bureau posted announcements dissuading them, the situation was calmer yesterday. However, there are still many vehicles carrying luggage and furniture going south on North Sichuan Road, especially in the evening.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Announcement</p>
<p>Yesterday, Public Security Bureau Announcement No. 76 was posted on various roads in the city, stating: "Regarding the announcement, it has been found that some unscrupulous people are spreading rumors, causing unrest among the people, which is detrimental to local security. The Bureau is responsible for protecting the lives and property of the people and is absolutely responsible for doing so. Therefore, this announcement is hereby issued so that all citizens are aware that they should live and work in peace and not disturb each other. If anyone mistakenly listens to rumors and moves, the relevant branch bureaus and offices have been instructed to advise and stop them. It is imperative that everyone complies with this, without fail. This is of utmost importance. October 1, 25th year of the Republic of China, Director Cai Jinjun."</p>
<p>Two Foreigners Arrested</p>
<p>At about 9:30 AM yesterday, a British man named Thomson inadvertently bumped into a Japanese soldier stationed at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Lao Bazi Road, causing a conflict. The Indian police were notified and dispatched several Western police officers to the scene. Just as they were about to take Thomson into a car, a Japanese Marine Corps car arrived with many Japanese soldiers, who forcibly dragged Thomson to their headquarters. After questioning, they released him to the police at about 10:00 AM. In addition, Mr. U.F. Meisling, a reporter for the local North China Daily News, and a Chinese photographer from the newspaper were arrested by the Japanese military at about 4:00 PM the day before yesterday for trying to photograph the area near the Japanese military defense post on Miller Road. After being questioned, they were released at about 5:00 PM. Although the photographs they took were inspected and returned, they were blurred and useless.</p>
<p>One Warship Exits the Port</p>
<p>In addition to the destroyer "Early Moon" which sailed away the afternoon before yesterday, the destroyer "Wenyue" also exited the port at 9:00 AM yesterday. It is reported that it is sailing west along the Yangtze River, and it is unclear whether it is going to Beijing or Wuhan. There are still five ships remaining in Shanghai.</p>
<p>French Concession on Alert</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that since the murder of Japanese sailor Tian Gang, the situation in Hongkou has been tense and relaxed at times, as changeable as autumn clouds. Citizens in this port are deeply uneasy. The French Concession authorities are deeply concerned that unscrupulous people in the city may take the opportunity to cause trouble, so they have increased surveillance by deploying plainclothes detectives and increasing posts to enhance security. At the same time, the iron gates at the Xieqiao and Nanyangqiao intersections between the Chinese and French concessions have been repaired in preparation for contingencies.</p>

<p>The fifth drawing for principal repayment of the Republic of China 23rd Year 6% British Gold Boxer Indemnity Bonds was held yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in the auditorium on the third floor of the Central Bank.

The 100-pound tickets, numbered from 2001 to 6000, were divided into four groups, with 40 tickets drawn from each group.

<p>The Bankers Association received a reply from the Ministry of Finance yesterday morning regarding the income tax on deposit interest.

<h3>Japan Strongly Requests President Chiang to Return to Nanjing for Negotiations</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News Publishes Critical Commentary</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the North-China Daily News published an editorial on the 1st titled "General Chiang and Japan," elaborating on the situation where Japan strongly requested President Chiang to return to Nanjing for negotiations on Sino-Japanese issues. The full text is translated as follows:</p>
<p>"When General Chiang Kai-shek returns to Nanjing, continued negotiations on the Sino-Japanese dispute can reduce some obstacles. Even if the Japanese side insists repeatedly, it is feared that Chiang will ultimately not be able to undertake the responsibility of negotiation himself. The Chinese side already has a formal Minister of Foreign Affairs who can fully represent the government and convey the government's opinions to Japan. What is expected of this Minister of Foreign Affairs is that he negotiate jointly with the Japanese Ambassador, and if results are achieved, they should be submitted to the government's superiors for approval. If this path is abandoned, then General Chiang, without the consent of the Central Political Committee, the Legislative Yuan, or other superiors of the National Government, cannot make any decisions on Sino-Japanese affairs. If General Chiang makes such decisions arbitrarily, he will be exceeding his authority and will inevitably face opposition, and the events he decides will certainly not be fulfilled. Japanese commentators on the current situation must realize that the current negotiations are between the two governments, not, as in the past, negotiations between a government and a powerful military figure. This period has passed. General Chiang's personal influence on diplomatic negotiations in China is certainly significant, but he does not have greater power than Foreign Minister Zhang Qun to unilaterally cause China to take certain actions. It is truly regrettable that China, at a time when its internal affairs urgently need to be reorganized, is burdened by diplomatic urgency, making it unable to concentrate on its primary tasks. However, the adjustment of diplomacy cannot be ignored, especially when it affects relations with neighboring countries, and resolution cannot be delayed. But resolution has a proper path. If it is insisted that negotiations must be conducted by the head of government, there is no reason for it. If China's ambassador to Japan, Xu Shiying, refused to negotiate Chinese affairs with Foreign Minister Arita, and insisted that Prime Minister Hirota personally handle everything, how would the Japanese side feel? What would be the situation?"</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Reorganization Bonds: Third Series Exchange Begins; Four Banks Will Handle Exchange Starting October 5th</h3>
<p>The six thousand million yuan of Zhejiang Province Reorganization Bonds from the 25th year of the Republic, with the first and second series of bond certificates exchanged for various old bonds, has already begun. Now the third series of bond certificates has also been printed, and exchange will begin on the 5th of this month. The announcement from the Zhejiang Finance Department is recorded as follows: "Announcement: It has been verified that the exchange of the first and second series of bond certificates of the reorganization bonds of this province for various old bonds has already begun successively, and the department has entrusted the Central, China, Communications, and Zhejiang Local Banks in Hangzhou as the managing exchange institutions, which has been announced in the newspapers. Now the third series of bond certificates has also been printed and will begin exchange on October 5th of this year, with November 10th of this year as the deadline for exchange. The Central, China, Communications, and Local Banks are still entrusted to handle the exchange. Those holding unredeemed bond certificates of the 20-year Liquidation Old Debt Bonds and the 21-year Treasury Bonds should comply with the aforementioned regulations and go to the managing Central, China, Communications, and Local Banks and their branches or offices within the prescribed time limit to apply for the exchange of the third series of reorganization bond certificates. In counties without Central, China, Communications, and Local Bank branches or offices, bondholders may fill out an application form and send it together with the old bond certificates to the county government for exchange on their behalf. The county government will first issue a temporary receipt and then transfer it to the provincial bank for exchange. The exchange procedure will still be handled in accordance with the regulations for the exchange method. The reorganization bond certificates have a minimum denomination of five yuan. All treasury bonds should be combined to calculate the actual principal for exchange. If the actual principal is less than five yuan, it should be converted at the exchange rate quoted by the managing Central, China, Communications, and Zhejiang Local Banks, and the difference should be paid in cash to make up the shortfall for the exchange of a five-yuan bond certificate. If one is unwilling to pay cash, one may also sell the remaining amount within five yuan to the managing bank at the quoted exchange rate. However, if the combined actual principal of multiple treasury bonds is five yuan or more, reorganization bond certificates should still be exchanged to show restrictions. Furthermore, the market price of the aforementioned treasury bonds is currently being discussed by the department with the managing banks, and the department has approved that the calculation will be based on 5.5 yuan per yuan of actual principal. If the market price differs greatly from the price determined this time in the future, the managing banks will jointly discuss it again, and the department will review and announce the changes. In addition to reporting and distributing to various banks, this announcement is made so that all bondholders are aware of it. This announcement."</p>
<h3>Central Bank Quotations: French Exchange Rate Continued to Fall Yesterday</h3>
<p>620 Francs Equal to 100 National Currency Units</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, after the French government implemented a new economic policy and devalued the franc, international finance has undergone serious changes, and China's exchange rate with France has also been affected. The Central Bank's foreign exchange quotations, which had been set at a nominal price of 582 francs per 100 national currency units on the 28th of last month, have continued to decline in recent days. Yesterday, the rate fell to 620 francs per 100 national currency units, but this is still a nominal price. Compared to the exchange rate of 464 francs per 100 national currency units a week ago, the difference is as much as 160 francs, and the severity of the decline is unprecedented. Other foreign exchange rates for British, American, and Japanese currencies remained unchanged. However, the German exchange rate was 74 marks per 100 national currency units, a sharp increase of two marks from the previous 76 marks. The market price of silver dollars has risen slightly, but not as sharply as in previous days.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Communications Rejects Request from Four Organizations: Difficulty in Reducing Sino-American Telegraph Rates</h3>
<p>The International Chamber of Commerce China Branch, the China International Trade Association, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the Sino-American Trade Association previously jointly submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications to reduce the telegraph rates between China and the United States by 51%. The Ministry of Communications has now rejected the request, stating: "Received and understood. The regulations for international telegraph rates are extremely complex. The international telegraph rates of various countries vary greatly. Some have the same distance but vastly different rates, while others have similar gold franc rates but significantly different values when converted into their respective national currencies. It is difficult to generalize. The ministry's previous approval did not mean that China's current international telegraph rates are based entirely on distance. However, distance remains an important factor in determining international rates. The various points supplemented in your submission are explained separately below: (1) The calculation of telegraph distances in various countries is based on the line route due to historical reasons, not on spatial distance. China's telegraph lines to the United States pass through the Philippines or Japan, so the rates between China and the United States should be higher than those between the Philippines and the United States or Japan and the United States. Your submission compares the spatial distances and rates from Little Luzon to the United States and from Japan to the United States with those from China to the United States, hastily concluding that the rates between China and the United States are more expensive, which clearly does not understand the aforementioned principle. Furthermore, Little Luzon is only one port in the Philippine Islands, and Japan is only one country among many in the Far East. If you want to compare the telegraph rates from China to the United States with those from other countries to the United States, you should compare the rates from all major Far Eastern countries to the United States to understand the whole picture. The following table compares the place of origin, the gold franc rate per word, and the comparison with China's rates: China-San Francisco 3.75, Hong Kong-San Francisco 3.75 (equal), Macau-San Francisco 4.15 (higher by 0.40), Vietnam-San Francisco 3.99 (higher by 0.24), Malaya and the Straits Settlements-San Francisco 4.35 (higher by 0.60), Siam-San Francisco 3.75 (equal), Dutch East Indies-San Francisco 4.35 (higher by 0.60), India-San Francisco 3.25 (lower by 0.50), Japan-San Francisco 3.05 (lower by 0.70), Philippines-San Francisco (from Little Luzon) 2.65 (lower by 1.10), (from Luzon Island) 2.90 (lower by 0.85), (from other islands) 3.55 (lower by 0.20). From the above table, the telegraph rates from various Far Eastern countries to the United States are either equal to China's, higher than China's, or lower than China's. Among them, the rates from Little Luzon to San Francisco seem particularly low, but the rates from other islands in the Philippines are similar to those from China. It cannot be said that the rates between China and the United States are uniquely expensive. (2) Your submission states that the American Radio Traffic Company and the Great Northern Telegraph Company are under the jurisdiction of this ministry, which is a misunderstanding. This ministry has signed service contracts with these companies regarding the transmission of telegrams and fees, which are mutually adhered to. Regarding telegraph rates, either party can propose revisions, but whether the other party agrees will depend on whether the reasons are sufficient and whether the need is urgent, and then detailed consideration and consultation will be required. (3) The collection of international telegraph fees in gold francs is based on the International Telecommunication Convention agreed upon at the 1932 International Telecommunication Conference. The following is an excerpt of Article 32 of the convention: 'The monetary unit used for compiling international telecommunication rates and preparing international accounts shall be the gold franc, which is divided into one hundred centimes, the weight of which is ten thirty-firsts of a gram, and the gold content of which is nine hundred thousandths.' Furthermore, Rule 31 of the Telegraph Regulations appended to the aforementioned convention stipulates that 'each country, for the purpose of calculating telegraph fees, shall specify the gold franc equivalence of its national currency, the value of which should be as close as possible to the value of the gold franc.' China is a silver standard country, and because there is no fixed ratio between gold and silver, the gold franc conversion rate is subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the national currency and the gold franc. This is a strict adherence to the clauses of the International Telecommunication Convention and is an obligation that any signatory country to the International Telecommunication Convention should fulfill. Your submission states that if a 100-word telegram is sent from Shanghai to San Francisco, and then the original telegram is sent back from San Francisco to Shanghai, the exchange rate conversion shows that Shanghai must pay 111 yuan more in national currency, indicating that China's conversion of rates is also more expensive. In fact, the gold franc rates for telegrams between China and the United States are exactly the same on both sides. The difference is due to the special monetary policy adopted by the United States, so most countries in the world have the same situation in telegrams to and from the United States. (4) Although the national telegraph business is state-owned, the fees for international telegrams must be shared with various foreign telegraph companies. If the telegraph rates between China and the United States are reduced by 50% as requested in your submission, it is uncertain how much the telegraph business between China and the United States can increase, and the original fee income will inevitably be greatly reduced, which would not only increase the economic difficulties of the ministry's telegraph administration but would also not be agreed to by the various foreign telegraph companies. Based on the above, it is difficult to approve the request to reduce the telegraph rates between China and the United States by 51%. Please be informed."</p>

<h3>Liu Boyi, Student at the Affiliated Primary School of the China Women's High School, Donates Funds to Purchase Aircraft for Birthday Celebration</h3>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government's Steps to Develop Salt Areas</h3>
<p>First Open a New Canal to Benefit Irrigation; Shanghai Banking Circles Willing to Assist</p>
<p>Regarding the development of the Subei salt and reclamation area, after the Jiangsu Provincial Government invited Shanghai banks and industrialists to form a group to inspect it, the development plan is being coordinated. Xin Xin News Agency reporters learned from banking circles yesterday that the Jiangsu Provincial Government authorities' plan to develop the salt and reclamation area is to first open up a new canal to benefit irrigation in the reclamation area. The route of the canal is located east of the Liyun River, starting from Nantong and heading north, extending to the waterway where the Huai River enters the sea as the end point. All surveying work has been completed, but the estimated project cost is 10 million yuan, so the project can only begin once the Jiangsu Provincial authorities have planned the funding. The Shanghai banking circles have been very supportive of the development of the salt and reclamation area, and the amount of investment by various banks in the rural areas of various counties in Subei in recent years is already considerable. However, for the safety of the investment, it is hoped that the Jiangsu Provincial Government has a strict development plan. The opening of a new canal that benefits the reclamation area is considered an essential part of the development plan, so they are quite willing to assist in the success of the plan.</p>

<p>Harvest Better in Jiangsu than in Zhejiang; First Batch of Zhejiang Autumn Cocoons Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>After the autumn cocoons were put on the market in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, silk factories and surplus cocoon merchants approved by the cocoon and silk control authorities in the two provinces borrowed money from banks to purchase them. Now, the cocoon merchants in Haining, Jiaxing, and other places in Zhejiang have all suspended weighing. However, due to the weather and the yellowing of mulberry leaves, the harvest is not as good as that of the spring cocoons, and the silk reeled from the cocoons is inferior to that of the spring cocoons. The cocoons purchased by silk mills in Shanghai have been loaded onto trains and transported to Shanghai, and stored in bank warehouses. The cocoon merchants in Wuxi, Liyang, and other places in Jiangsu are also about to suspend weighing. However, the harvest is slightly better than that of Zhejiang, and the silk reeled is also better than that of Zhejiang.</p>
<h3>Opening Date for the United Match Production and Sales Company Undecided</h3>
<p>Due to Insufficient Preparation by Various Branch Offices</p>

It is now learned that the various branch offices have telegraphed Shanghai, stating that they are unable to prepare in time and requesting that the date be rescheduled. This is because some of the plans are not suitable for local conditions and need to be studied, revised, or supplemented by the various factories, and the previous transactions of the various factories also need ample time to be settled. As for the fact that some factories are unable to raise funds due to economic difficulties, this is not the main reason for the postponement. According to a person in charge of the head office, the opening date has not yet been determined and is currently being discussed with the various branch offices and factories.</p>

<p>Caused by Workers Forming a Union; Female Weaving Workers on Strike</p>
<p>The Hongzhang Textile Dyeing Factory at 381 Maigen Road employs more than 1,000 male and female workers and is a giant in Shanghai's dyeing industry.

However, the factory learned of this and dismissed worker representatives He Genmu and Xu Wenxue on September 28th, causing dissatisfaction among the entire workforce, resulting in a strike. That evening, the factory saw that the situation was serious and verbally agreed to reinstate He and Xu, and the dispute was resolved. On October 1st, the factory dismissed He Genmu again. Yesterday morning at 6:00 am, when all the male and female workers entered the factory to work, the factory ordered the workers to replace their guarantee papers before they would be allowed to work. The workers believed that this was a means by the factory to undermine the labor movement and refused to accept it. The factory, considering that the workers were opposed, dismissed five more representatives who were enthusiastic about the labor movement: Zhang Shunlai, Ni Rucai, Wang Afang, Ni Jingou, and Chen Linhai. Currently, the weaving workers have also gone on strike, expressing their united action. It is also reported that all the workers have decided to send representatives to the Municipal Party Department, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the General Labor Union this morning to petition for assistance.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at 4:50, Huang Runfu, a police officer at Post No. 12 near Tangjiawan outside Laoximen, saw a person carrying quilts and clothes, looking suspicious. Officer Huang tried to question him, but he fled towards the French Concession. He was pursued to Lafayette Road, where a patrolman on duty ordered him to stop. He did not listen, so a shot was fired, hitting the person in the left arm. He fell to the ground in pain and was arrested. He was taken to the police station and identified himself as Liu Chunrong, 27 years old, from Shanghai. He stole the stolen goods from the Xilin Road Youqu Primary School because of his financial difficulties. Since the case was in the Chinese territory, he was handed over to the Ximen Sub-Bureau.

The owner of the stolen goods was notified to claim the items, and a document was prepared to send him to the Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>August Hotel Industry Aviation Donation</h3>
<p>The collection of the hotel industry's aviation donation has been deeply appreciated by people from all walks of life.

<h3>Yesterday's Verdict in the Japanese Sailor Case: Yang Wendao and Ye Haisheng Sentenced to Death; Zhou Yuan Delivered the Verdict to the Defendants Last Night</h3>
<p>In the case of the shooting death of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo, yesterday afternoon was the date scheduled for the verdict announcement. At 1:30 PM, the police department dispatched officers to escort the defendant Ye Haisheng (also known as "Little Guangdong") to the First Criminal Court on the third floor of the First Special District Court. Soon after, the two defendants, Yang Wendao and Zhou Sherong, were also escorted to the court. The police department also sent thirty to forty Chinese, Western, and Japanese detectives to the court, distributed inside and outside the First Court for surveillance. All those entering the court to listen were carefully inspected by bailiffs, and all precautions were strictly enforced. However, armed Japanese soldiers were not seen attending the court hearing. At 2:00 PM, Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court, along with assessors Xiao Xiefen and Feng Shide, and prosecutor Tang Peiyou, ascended the bench with clerk Ding Chongnan. The lawyers appearing in court for the police department were Bo Liang and Ru Bao Yi. The defendants' defense lawyers, Zhang Zhirang, Fan Gang, Wang Shizong, and Tang Huaiqun, all appeared in court. Presiding Judge Qian ordered the three defendants, Yang, Ye, and Zhou, to be brought before the court. After questioning their names and ages, the verdict was immediately announced: Yang Wendao and Ye Haisheng were found guilty of joint murder and sentenced to death, with the deprivation of all civil rights for life. One pistol, six bullets, one shell casing, and one bullet head, along with a book on hiding guns, were all confiscated. Zhou Sherong was found not guilty. Presiding Judge Qian also informed Yang and others that if they did not agree with the verdict, they could file an appeal within ten days according to the law. Yang and Zhou remained silent upon hearing the verdict. The detectives then took Yang and others back to the police station for detention. The verdict is recorded as follows. This verdict was drafted and proofread by the court in the afternoon and sent to the Ministry of Works' Legal Department, the defendants themselves, and their respective lawyers after 6:00 PM in the evening.</p>
<p>Main Text</p>
<p>Yang Wendao and Ye Haisheng are found guilty of joint murder and are each sentenced to death, with the deprivation of civil rights for life. One pistol, six bullets, one shell casing, and one bullet head, along with a book on hiding guns, are all confiscated. Zhou Sherong is found not guilty.</p>
<p>Facts</p>
<p>Yang Wendao was the former chairman of the Hongshun Mutual Aid Society, and Ye Haisheng, also known as Little Guangdong, was a member of the society and was known as an axe gang member. In November of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), Yang Wendao left Shanghai due to some matter, and the Hongshun Mutual Aid Society he presided over also disintegrated. In November of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), after Yang Wendao returned to Shanghai, he organized the Tongren and Tongyi Associations with Ye Haisheng and others, with Yang Wendao as the chairman of both associations. Ye Haisheng also served as a member of both associations, but the number of members was small, and its influence was far inferior to that of the Hongshun Mutual Aid Society. At the end of October in the 24th year (1935), Yang Wendao, Ye Haisheng, and others secretly plotted to assassinate Japanese officers or soldiers, hoping to provoke unrest and take the opportunity to expand their influence in the Hongkou area. After the plan was decided, on the afternoon of November 3rd of the same year at 3:00 PM, they first went to Doulean Road to inspect the location. On the evening of the 5th, they drew lots in the Tongyi Association at 71 Yongji Lane, Bazilu to decide who would carry out the plan. Ye Haisheng drew the "go" character. On the afternoon of the 9th of the same month at around 8:00 PM, Yang Wendao handed a pistol to Ye Haisheng. After obtaining the gun, Ye Haisheng waited at the intersection of Doulean Road. Near 9:00 PM, he saw a Japanese sailor (namely Nakayama Hideo) walking there. Ye Haisheng followed the sailor and walked to the vicinity of Fungle Lane on Doulean Road (it was already 9:00 PM), and shot the sailor in the head from the side. The sailor fell to the ground and died shortly after. After the shooting, Ye Haisheng fled into Fungle Lane and abandoned the pistol (No. 1411446) under the pavilion of the watchman and fled back to the Yuegong Hotel. In April of this year, the police department discovered this and first sent officers to Qingdao to bring Ye Haisheng to trial. On the 19th of the same month, Yang Wendao was arrested at 18 Tongan Lane, Tangshan Road, Shanghai, and a green Practical Physics book with a hole dug for hiding a gun was found in his bedroom. Together with Zhou Sherong, who was suspected of involvement, they were successively brought to trial and prosecuted.</p>
<p>Reasoning</p>
<p>The deceased Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo was shot to death at the entrance of Fungle Lane, Baole An Road at 9:00 PM on November 9th of the 24th year of the Republic of China. The condition of the wounds at the time of death: on the back of the head, 7 centimeters from the center of the occipital protuberance diagonally to the upper right, and 6 centimeters from the rear and upper side of the right external auditory canal, there was a circular entrance wound with a diameter of 0.7 centimeters, with arterial bleeding and copious amounts of blood. On the frontal part of the head, slightly in the center, there was an irregular exit wound with a diameter of 2 centimeters. The surrounding skull was fragmented and fractured, with a clear bulging brain matter, and a part of the brain matter was exposed from the wound with a large amount of arterial bleeding, indicating a very critical condition. The cause of death was brain damage and brain hemorrhage. At 1:10 AM on October (sic, should be November) 10th, Japanese military doctor Lieutenant Colonel Ogawa Isamu examined and issued a diagnosis report. According to a report by Japanese Deputy Head Detective Kai Isaso (transliteration) of the Jiaxing Road Police Department, at 11:40 PM on the afternoon of November of last year, a pistol was found under the watchman's pavilion in Fungle Lane (No. 2411446), along with six bullets. A report by Japanese Detective No. 61 of the Des Voeux Road Police Department stated that at 9:00 PM on the afternoon of November 9th of last year, after the incident, there was a pool of blood and a bullet was found eight feet south of it. A report by Japanese Detective No. 51 of the police department stated that at 10:00 PM on the afternoon of November 9th of last year, he found a bullet casing at the scene of the incident on Doulean Road. A report by Western Detective Carey (transliteration) of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department's Firearms Section stated that at 12:15 AM on the morning of November 10th of last year, a pistol (No. 2411446) was handed over to him for inspection. The inspection revealed that the pistol's mechanism was in good condition and had been recently fired, and there was also a shell casing and a bullet (the items found by Japanese Detective No. 61 and Japanese Detective No. 51 at the scene of the incident) handed over for inspection. After his identification, the bullets and shell casings handed over were all fired from this gun, etc. The police department also presented the pistol, bullets, and shell casings as evidence, which is sufficient to prove that the presented gun and ammunition were the murder weapon that killed Nakayama Hideo, which is beyond doubt. What should be investigated now is whether the defendants are the murderers. According to Ye Haisheng's confession in the police department and this court, at the end of October of the 24th year, at the Tongyi Association, Yang Wendao said: "I want to kill a Japanese officer or soldier. Hongkou will definitely be in chaos. We can take this opportunity to expand our influence in the Hongkou area. At that time, we will all benefit." "But before we act, we have to go look at the location." "On November 3rd at 3:00 PM, we went north, walked to Doulean Road, turned west, then went straight north to Hongkou Park, and then took a tram home." "At 9:30 PM on the 5th, in the association (71 Yongji Lane), Wendao prepared paper rolls. There was a 'go' character in a triangle. I grabbed one, opened it, and saw a 'go' character inside." "Wendao said, 'Okay, we'll act on the evening of the 9th.'" "On the evening of the 9th at around 8:00 PM, Wendao handed me a pistol and told me to wait at the entrance of Doulean Road." "I waited for about half an hour and saw a Japanese sailor walking in front. I followed him to Doulean Road and walked to the vicinity of Fungle Lane. I used the gun to shoot him in the head and then fled into Fungle Lane, abandoning the pistol under a pavilion." He also said that Wendao taught him how to fire the pistol. At that time, Wendao taught him how to fire the gun in preparation to fight against the 36 parties at the Taikoo Wharf. At that time, he saw four or five pistols in Taikoo Warehouse No. 1, but they were different from the gun used to kill the Japanese sailor, etc. He described the circumstances of the murder in great detail as if he had witnessed it himself. The assigned judge of this court went to the scene of the incident, the Yuegong Hotel, and the former site of the Tongyi Association at 71 Yongji Lane for an on-site inspection. Ye Haisheng repeated how they conspired, how they inspected the location, how he followed the sailor and shot him, and how he abandoned the gun and fled to the assigned judge without any discrepancies. This is supported by the inspection record and attached diagrams. This is consistent with the testimony of witness Hu Xianghe, who said that after hearing the gunshot, he saw someone wearing black clothes fleeing from the road into Fungle Lane, and the testimony of witness Pan Qiaomei, who said that she was walking south on Doulean Road that night. When she walked to No. 191, she saw a Japanese sailor and a person wearing a black suit walking north in opposite directions. Immediately after, she heard a gunshot and the sailor fell to the ground, and the person in the suit disappeared, etc. The police department also seized a black suit belonging to Ye Haisheng in Qingdao. According to Ye Haisheng's confession, he was wearing this suit around November 9th of last year, which shows that his confession is consistent with the facts. It is also found that the defendant is known as an axe gang member (see the files of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters). The facts of the murder he described are credible. Although he stated in his confession that he shot the sailor in the back (from a distance of five or six steps), which seems to be inconsistent with the angle calculated by the Institute of Forensic Medicine and the fact that the bullet was found behind the bloodstains, according to Pan Qiaomei's testimony, the Japanese sailor was on the west side and the person in the black suit was on the east side, both walking north. She passed between the two, and Fungle Lane is on the east side of the road, which shows that the murderer fired the gun from the east side and shot from the side of the sailor, not in the back. This is consistent with Ogawa Isamu's diagnosis and Hu Xianghe's statement that he saw the murderer fleeing from the middle of the road to Fungle Lane (see the survey map). Therefore, Ye Haisheng's claim that he shot in the back is not credible. As for the layer where the bullet was found behind the corpse, according to Western Deputy Inspector Claude, there were over a hundred people at the scene at the time, and the bullet may have been kicked to the south behind the corpse. The location where the shell casing fell is on the same line as the place where the bullet was found (see the survey map), which is reasonable and not surprising. Although Hu Xianghe initially stated in the police department that the person who fled was a sailor, when questioned, Pan Qiaomei stated that the person who fled was wearing a black suit. Hu Xianghe was 84 feet away from the person who fled, and the light was not very bright, while Pan Qiaomei brushed past the person who fled, so her observation was clearer. Pan Qiaomei's testimony is more credible. Furthermore, although Ye Haisheng's confession was not entirely consistent, this court specially informed him of the consequences during the third trial and told him that he could not go back on his word in the future. According to his statement, he would absolutely not regret what he said this time. When confronted with Yang Wendao, the defendant turned to Yang Wendao and said, "On November 3rd, we went to Hongkou Park to see the location and came back. On the 5th, we took paper slips, and I got a 'go' character," etc., which was without any concealment. During the site inspection, according to Hu Xianghe, he saw the person who fled turn into Fungle out from behind the telephone pole. Ye Haisheng immediately corrected him, saying that he went straight into Fungle Lane and did not pass through the telephone pole. He said, "I killed someone, of course I would run in the widest possible way, and wouldn't run through that narrow place." He spoke very clearly about the escape situation, and it is beyond doubt that he is the principal offender in the murder. However, during the fourth trial on May 27th of this year, he suddenly overturned his previous confession, denying that he had committed the murder and claiming that his previous confession was made under torture. He claimed that he swallowed a suit button and two keys in the police department and could be examined, etc. However, after this court ordered a forensic examination, according to the report, Ye Haisheng is currently 28 years old. He was examined by the doctor at the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital, who used X-rays to examine his intestines and found no metal objects, which proves that there were no swallowed objects in his intestines at that time. He also claimed that he felt pain on both sides of his ribs, with the left side being more severe, which was not caused by beatings but seemed to be caused by soft objects rubbing against him. The examination was conducted on the sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs, but there were no visible signs of damage on the outside, and the skin was the same as the surrounding skin. There was a scar one centimeter long and half a centimeter wide under the left nostril on the upper lip, which was long, round, soft, and very neat, with a pink center and clear white lines. The tissue showed signs of skinning and had not been out for two or three weeks. Forensic doctor Wei Ligong had an examination report on May 28th attached to the file, which cannot prove that the defendant was indeed tortured. Moreover, according to the defendant's confession, the torture occurred two weeks after the adjournment, which was May 6th. Before May 6th, the defendant had already confessed to killing the Japanese sailor, which is obviously a pretext to retract his confession. As for the defendant Yang Wendao, he did not deny that he was the former chairman of the Hongshun Mutual Aid Society, that the society disintegrated after he left Shanghai in November of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, that he returned to Shanghai in November of the 23rd year and formed the Tongren and Tongyi Associations, and that he was the chairman of both associations, with few members. Although he did not admit to the fact of jointly murdering the Japanese sailor, the confession of a co-defendant that is unfavorable to himself can be adopted as evidence of the crime of another co-offender, as repeatedly stated in precedents by the Supreme Court. In this case, according to Ye Haisheng's statement, Yang Wendao participated in the planning of the murder, and the pistol used to commit the murder was handed over by the defendant. There is also a pistol as evidence, so his liability as an accomplice cannot be evaded by empty words. Moreover, the police department found a green Practical Physics book in the defendant's bedroom at 18 Tongan Lane, Tangshan Road on April 19th of this year, with a hole dug in the book for hiding a pistol. After Western Deputy Inspector Claude obtained the book, he did not ask any questions, and the defendant immediately stated that the book belonged to him. There is a report from the Western Deputy Inspector to verify this. This court sent the book and pistol No. 2411446 to the Institute of Forensic Medicine for examination. According to the description report, the book has a pistol-shaped cavity dug out from page 16 to page 383, with a length of 15.6 cm, a width of about 11.2 cm, and a depth of 2.2 cm. There are traces of a gun shape drawn in blue pencil on page 16, and there are three traces of yellowish-brown rust on the left side, the middle is arc-shaped, and the right side has a few dotted rust spots and transverse impressions. The traces can match the texture length and distance of the corresponding part of the pistol (No. 1411446) (refer to the description report No. 99 of the Institute of Forensic Medicine). According to the report of Pan Xiangdi Kesun (transliteration), an employee of the Shanghai Municipal Council's fingerprint department, both sides of this book for hiding a pistol (i.e., green Practical Physics) are imprinted with traces of this PB pistol (i.e., No. 2411446), and photos have been taken, such as the circle on the gun handle and the letters PB inside the circle, as well as the safety button and screw heads on the gun, and the raised stripes on the gun handle are all imprinted with very clear traces. In addition, the book is also stained with yellow, which is the rust on the gun. In addition, the distance of the traces printed in the book is exactly the same as the size of this PB pistol (see the notes of May 1). He also said that after returning from testifying in court last time, he used a microscope to enlarge the photos. There are three photos in total. The first is the rifling on the rear section of the gun barrel, showing the situation printed on the pages of the book. The second is the traces of the screws on the pistol printed on the pages of the book. The third is the traces of the letters PB on the gun handle printed on the pages of the book. In addition, because the gun shuttle was not stored properly, the rust on the gun stuck to the book. After taking the photos, I used instruments to compare and draw red circles, marking all the same points (referring to the rust marks in the book and the rust marks on the pistol). There are as many as 41 points. I can assert that the hole dug in this book was used to hide this pistol, etc. Three enlarged photos were presented as evidence. This court sent the photos to the Institute of Forensic Medicine for review, and their views were the same. The green Practical Physics book belonged to the defendant and was used to hide the pistol, etc. The defendant admitted this without any difference in this court on April 20th of this year. Now it has been proven that the gun hidden in the green Practical Physics book is the murder weapon that killed the Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo, so Ye Haisheng's statement that the murder weapon was handed over by Yang Wendao is even more credible. Although Yang Wendao argued that my gun was obtained from the Public Security Bureau and that this book was used to hide the Public Security Bureau gun, and that the gun has been returned to the Public Security Bureau, the police department verified that in the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), Li Mao of the Public Security Bureau lent the defendant a Timon (transliteration) brand pistol with the number 87558, which was licensed by the Shanghai Municipal Council as Y-2617. Later, Li Mao notified the Shanghai Municipal Council that the gun had been recovered and requested that the license be revoked, which is true. However, during the trial, the police department brought the gun (i.e., the Timon brand pistol that Li Mao lent to Yang Wendao) and a similar Timon brand pistol to the court for demonstration. When the Timon brand pistol was placed in the green Practical Physics book, it could not be put in at all. When the pistol (No. 2411446) picked up at the scene of the incident was placed in the book, it fit perfectly without any gap. When the defendant was questioned, he changed his statement again, saying that this book was not mine, and the previous one was mine (see the notes of April 27th and May 1st). The discrepancies in his statements are already a pretext. However, he still did not mention that he had been framed. Until the third trial on May 20th, he suddenly claimed that this was entirely Yang Jianzhong who harmed me. When questioned, Yang Jianzhong said that he had never been to the defendant's house and had never seen this book for hiding guns. This court obtained Yang Jianzhong's fingerprints and palm prints and sent them to the Institute of Forensic Medicine for examination. After a detailed comparison, the institute did not find any similar textures to the residual fingerprints in the book in the submitted fingerprints and palm prints, and there is a appraisal report from the institute to prove this. The defendant's claim that Yang Jianzhong framed him is purely empty words. Not only could he not specify the cause and process of the framing, but he could not even provide evidence to prove that Yang Jianzhong had ever been to the defendant's house on any date. This defense is also not acceptable. Although this court discovered another group of accomplices who were preparing to murder Japanese people during the trial, including Zhu Guisheng and Chen Enming, who confessed in the Public Security Bureau that they and Shi Fengting had participated in the case of murdering Nakayama Hideo, and pointed out that Shi Fengting, who was at large, was the one who carried out the act, and that the murder weapon was sent by Zhang Yuhua, an accomplice in the Ci Jiang case, regardless of whether Zhang Yuhua absolutely denied that he had sent the gun, Zhu Guisheng, etc. were questioned separately by this court and also denied the circumstances of the murder of Nakayama Hideo. The police department has already disposed of the case without prosecution. Even if we observe the confession of the Public Security Bureau, it only said that Shi Fengting carried out the act, but they did not witness how he carried it out. It was also said that Shi Fengting was wearing a long robe at the time, which does not match the statements of witnesses Hu Xianghe and Pan Qiaomei, etc., who witnessed the murderer wearing short black clothes (a suit). From this point of view, it is also not enough to be favorable evidence for the defendants. Murdering a Japanese sailor is enough to provoke Sino-foreign disputes, and the danger caused by the crime is significant. The defendant Ye Haisheng is the principal offender, and the defendant Yang Wendao is the first person to propose the idea and is in a commanding position, so both should be severely punished to serve as a warning. However, the defendant Zhou Sherong has always denied that he was an accomplice in the murder of Nakayama Hideo, and Ye Haisheng's confession only involved the defendant in empty words. Compared with the situation where the book for hiding guns and the traces of the gun and rust in the book were found in Yang Wendao's house, it is completely different. The confession of Ye Haisheng involved more than just Zhou Sherong. Even the Korean Jie Ke (Han Qiliang) was also implicated, but after investigation by this court, the Korean did not know Yang Wendao. The case was tried for several months, and no conclusive evidence was found to prove that Zhou Sherong was not an accomplice. Ye Haisheng's confession involving the defendant lacked supporting evidence and could not be used as the basis for a criminal judgment. Regarding the defendant, he should be acquitted. Based on the above conclusions, according to Article 28 and Article 271, Paragraph 1, Article 37, Paragraph 1, Article 38, Paragraph 1, Clauses 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code, and Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is as Chinese. The prosecutors Zhang Zongru and Tang Peiyou of this court made statements in court. October 2nd of the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), Qian Hongye, presiding judge of the Criminal Court of the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Court, assessors Feng Shide, and Xiao Xiefen. It is heard that Yang and Ye are currently detained in the Western Prison on Ward Road, and Zhou Rongsher is detained in the General Police Department.</p>
<h3>Two Corpses Case at Women's Hospital: The Real Murderer Confesses the Truth: Lu Aili Cuts Uterus and Dies; Yu Gengsheng Tricked into Blood Transfusion and Dies</h3>
<p>The case of the tragic discovery of the burial of two male and female corpses at the Hongkou Women's Hospital at the intersection of Zhaofeng Road and Tangshan Road has attracted widespread attention in society, and the police and detectives have spared no effort in pursuing clues. As a result, at around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the Huishan Police Department learned that the main culprits in the case, Liang Meiyu and Zhang Wenhua, had been arrested together. The process of obtaining the clues was quite painstaking. On September 30th, the detectives learned that Liang and Zhang were hiding at No. 13, Lane 455, Kangti Road, in the French Concession, and that there were still vacant rooms in the house for rent. They immediately disguised themselves as renters and went to the second landlord to rent the front building. After reconnaissance, they learned that Liang and others were living in the pavilion room. They then falsely told the second landlord that the front building was too narrow and asked to exchange it for the pavilion room. At that time, the second landlord did not understand the reason and refused. The detectives then told him the truth, and he was shocked and led the detectives to knock on the door of the pavilion room. The detectives rushed in and arrested Liang and Zhang, seizing more than 900 silver dollars on the spot, and immediately took them back to the police station. After investigation, it was learned that Liang's real name was Chen Xiaobao, the two victims were a man named Yu Gengsheng and a woman named Lu Aili from Sichuan. On September 2nd, they went to the hospital to request an abortion. At that time, they stated that the surgery fee was 35 yuan, and both the man and woman were admitted to the hospital. On the afternoon of the 3rd, Liang and others performed the surgery, but unexpectedly, they accidentally cut Lu's uterus, and she died on the spot. At that time, Yu Gengsheng had noticed something in the next room and ran out to argue with Liang and others. Liang and others knew that a murder case had occurred and that they would be caught in the legal net. They immediately became murderous and discussed with Zhang Wenhua to murder Yu Gengsheng to cover up the crime. On the one hand, Liang continued to persuade Yu with gentle words, falsely claiming that Lu was temporarily unconscious and that she could wake up if her husband received a blood transfusion. At that time, Yu believed it to be true and urged Liang to draw his blood for the transfusion. Unexpectedly, Liang and Zhang used an extremely strong Parenoction anesthetic at this time and injected it into Yu's veins, and strangled him with a towel.

<h3>Siamese Art Students to Perform in China</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Replies to Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Expressing Willingness to Participate in Welcoming Them</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, in response to a letter from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission seeking participation in initiating a welcome for the Siamese Arts Department's Dance and Music School to perform in China, has replied expressing its agreement. The original texts of the two letters are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Letter from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission's letter stated, "According to the mission to Siam's public letter dated August 25th, 'Recently, our mission's secretary, Liu Yiling, submitted a report stating that the Siamese Arts Department's Dance and Music School will accept an invitation from the United States to perform in the U.S. If the Chinese side expresses a welcome, they will come to China for performances on their way home. Please review and handle this matter.' Accordingly, this matter presented by the secretary is about promoting Sino-Siamese cultural exchange and enhancing friendship between the two countries, and it is feasible. In addition to forwarding to the Ministry of Education, we are also sending a copy of the original report and attachments for your reference and handling, and await your reply." Upon approval, a letter was sent to the Ministry of Education on September 18th requesting them to send personnel to the commission for consultation. The result was that welcoming Siamese Arts Department Dance and Music School students to perform in China was deemed feasible. It was also decided to invite your chamber of commerce, the National Drama School, the National Music Conservatory, the Ministry of Education, and this commission to jointly initiate a welcome and organize a reception office, and record it in the minutes. We have always admired your chamber of commerce's efforts to promote social causes, sparing no effort, and this matter is particularly related to foreign relations, and we trust you will agree. In addition to the Ministry of Education informing the above two schools, a corresponding letter is sent for your reference, and we hope to receive your reply."</p>
<p>Letter from the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>After receiving the letter, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce immediately replied, expressing its agreement.

<h3>Pujiang River Continues to Have High Tides, Exceeding Predicted Levels</h3>
<p>Low-Lying Roads and Gutters Spout Water, Today's High Tide Will Not Overflow the Banks</p>
<p>The Pujiang River has been experiencing high tides for several days, coinciding with the annual high tide period after the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar. Therefore, the tides have been quite high, exceeding the predicted levels of the Dredging Bureau. We have inquired with the bureau to record the situation below:</p>
<p>Tide Exceeds Predictions</p>
<p>According to the Dredging Bureau's prediction, the high tide at 0:35 PM the day before yesterday (the 1st) was supposed to be only 11 feet and 5 inches. Unexpectedly, due to the strong northeasterly winds at that time, the tide surged greatly, reaching 12 feet and 1.5 inches, exceeding the prediction by more than one foot. Yesterday morning (the 2nd) at 1:00 AM, the high tide in the Pujiang River was predicted to be 11 feet and 3.4 inches, but the actual height reached 11 feet and 9.5 inches, exceeding the prediction by six inches. This caused the tide to backflow and spout water from the gutters on the low-lying roads near the Bund, creating waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>High Tide Season</p>
<p>Today is the 18th day of the eighth month in the lunar calendar. It is commonly believed that the tide will be high on this day. However, according to the Dredging Bureau's prediction, if the weather is clear and there are no unexpected adverse conditions, there should be no risk of the banks overflowing. The predicted times and levels for today's morning and afternoon tides are recorded below: The high tide at 1:39 AM is predicted to be 11 feet and 1 inch, and the high tide at 1:59 PM is predicted to be 11 feet and 3 inches. However, if the wind is northeasterly, the actual water level may slightly exceed the predicted level.</p>

<h3>Chinese Medicine Association Scheduled to Discuss Insurance Measures</h3>
<p>More than 50 associations in this city, including the Chinese Medicine Association, have observed that member stores' fire insurance policies are underwritten by foreign merchants and companies. Once an accident occurs, the companies often make excuses for dissatisfaction and shirk their responsibility to compensate. Recently, Bao Feng Medicine Store, No. 14 Xianggua Street in this city, which has been established for a long time and has a good reputation, has been insured for fire for many years by six companies including the British Sun Insurance Company. On June 7th of this year, the neighbors were negligent and a fire broke out, causing the store's goods to suffer significant water damage and huge losses. Compensation has been requested from the insurance companies, but negotiations have been ongoing with no satisfactory result. The associations have observed that the insurance companies often delay and make excuses, providing no protection for the members' losses. It is proposed to schedule a meeting to discuss effective measures.</p>

<h3>Five Million Yuan Extortion: Suspect Yang Yiping Reported to the Police by Asorín: Comes to Retrieve Huang Yuanliang's Letter</h3>
<p>Spanish national Asorín, manager of the Jai Alai Stadium at No. 3 Rue Amiral Bayle in the French Concession, had been receiving threatening letters from criminals by mail for the past month, demanding five million yuan. After reporting to the police, another letter was received on the 28th of last month stating, "If you are sincere in negotiating, send a letter to Huang Yuanliang, Room 23, Dongya Hotel, Sincere Company, Nanjing Road," and so on. The French police fabricated a letter and sent a detective, together with the Zhabei police, to investigate at the Dongya Hotel. They found no one named Huang Yuanliang. The letter was placed in a glass display case specifically for letters, and Detective Zhou Buguang of the French police was assigned to wait. At 3:30 PM on the 29th of last month, a Fujianese man named Yang Yiping, also known as A-Bai Yang, 24 years old, came to the Dongya Hotel to retrieve Huang Yuanliang's letter. He was arrested by the detective and taken back to the police station. He claimed to be an American citizen. He was taken to the US Consulate for verification, but the US Consulate refused to acknowledge him. Yang was temporarily detained in the Public Concession police station and transferred to the First Special District Court. The French police filed a report with the Second Special District Court, requesting detectives to transfer Yang to the case. Yesterday, he was transferred to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, where Judge Zhang Chaozuo conducted the interrogation. The police prosecutor requested that the defendant be detained for further investigation before another interrogation. Yang Yiping stated that he grew up in Macau and recently came to Shanghai from Macau to look for a classmate named Sun, but was unsuccessful. He said that on that day, he went to the Dongya Hotel and happened to see a letter addressed to Huang Yuanliang. He recalled that Huang was also a classmate in Macau, so he took the letter to look at Huang's address so he could go find him. He had no other intentions. After verifying the statements, the court ordered the case to be rescheduled for the 12th, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Operating a Hospital Under a False Name, Defrauding for Four Years, Hiring Women to Solicit Donations Everywhere: Tightly Organized and Only Recently Exposed</h3>
<p>In recent years, major banks, businesses, and households in this city have repeatedly received letters bearing the names of the Guangji Charity Hospital and the Civilian Women and Children's Hospital. The content of these letters generally states that these hospitals are entirely charitable in nature, providing medical care and medicine to civilians free of charge. In order to promote charitable causes, all sectors are requested to make voluntary contributions and generously donate. Two or three days later, two young women who looked like students, carrying briefcases and donation books, would come to solicit donations, ranging from five or ten yuan for larger contributions to one or two yuan for smaller ones, and they would issue receipts to prove authenticity. Because the victims did not know the truth, they did not investigate. Unexpectedly, this matter was recently discovered by Chinese Detective No. 50 of the Putuo Road Police Station, who investigated the Guangji Charity Hospital listed on the letter at No. 31 and 33, Lane 524, Gordon Road, and No. 1042 Huishan Road, Hongkou, and the Civilian Women and Children's Hospital at No. 15 Ruikang Lane, Chengdu Road. None of these addresses had such names or hospitals. It was then discovered that the whole thing was a fraud to obtain money under false pretenses. The investigation was then launched. It was discovered that Hu Weimin claimed to be the director of the Guangji Charity Hospital, and that Sun Lai生, Chen Guantai, and others organized a Civilian Women and Children's Hospital. Beforehand, they would distribute letters soliciting donations to all sectors. Three days later, they would order the young women they hired, dressed in student attire and carrying briefcases, donation books, receipts, etc., to go and collect donations. Since 1933 and up to the present, the number of victims has been countless. Only because these gangs were so tightly organized that their operations were difficult to detect. Finally, at 9:30 AM yesterday, Chinese Detective No. 50 arrested Yang Ying (also known as Yang Yunqin, living at No. 149 Kuling Road), a 17 year old from Jiading, and Zhang Xuexiang, who were soliciting donations on Henan Road and Beijing Road. A briefcase was found on Yang, containing donation books, receipt books, and Yang's own and the Guangji Charity Hospital Director Hu Weimin's name cards. A bundle of letters soliciting donations to all sectors was also found on Zhang. Based on Yang's confession, another accomplice, Sun Suzhen, an 18-year-old from Jiangyin, was arrested at No. 24 Tongan Lane, Xinzha Bridge Road. At No. 59 North Wuxi Road, accomplices Sun Lai生 from Wujiang, Chen Guantai from Shaoxing, and Chen's concubine Sun Cuilan, a 17-year-old from Taicang, were also arrested. A total of six people were arrested and taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the case, saying that there were many victims in this case and that the police had not yet been able to investigate in detail, so he requested that they be detained. The seized items were presented to the court. When Yang Ying was questioned, she admitted that she was hired by the fugitive Hu Weimin at a monthly salary of ten yuan and had been working as a solicitor since 1933. After Judge Chuan Lin briefly questioned the other people, he ordered them to be detained for five days for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>A Big Sister, After Ten Years (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Li Shouzhen</p>
<p>After returning to Shanghai, the first thing I did was to find Ping. When I went to the address my big sister had given me, it turned out to be a small Western-style house, quite exquisite in appearance. As I entered, I saw a child of about three years old sitting on a small toy car, playing and giggling, which was quite amusing. I guessed immediately that it was Ping's child and asked him, "Baby! Where's Mommy?" The child looked at me with wide eyes, but Ping heard me and hurried out from behind. She was surprised and delighted to see me, and I, of course, felt boundless comfort.</p>
<p>We talked about our past lives, sharing what had happened since we parted and our current situations. She complained that I hadn't written to her, and I said that she had cut off contact herself. We bickered like children, and finally, she asked me how I knew her address. Only then did she remember her big sister. As soon as we mentioned her big sister, her enthusiasm waned. Eventually, she told me the reason why her big sister looked so haggard.</p>
<p>After getting married, her big sister and her husband went to Shanghai together. Her husband worked in a certain government agency, and her big sister found a position in a private elementary school. The young couple lived quite contentedly. However, less than half a year later, her husband fell in love with a student from a certain girls' school. Previously, her husband had always gone out with her big sister to see plays or go on outdoor trips on Sundays or holidays, but later, he always made excuses to go out whenever he had free time. Her big sister, being gentle by nature, still thought that her husband had many friends and was busy with social engagements, and never blamed him.</p>
<p>The following year, her big sister had her first child, so he told her to give up her teaching position and stay home to raise the child. He himself, however, made even more excuses to stay away from home every day. In the spring of the third year, her big sister had her second child. Only seven days later, her husband went on a trip alone. On the third day after her husband left, a middle-aged woman came to her big sister's house, saying that her husband had taken her daughter out to play and had not returned yet, which made her very worried. Only then did her big sister understand her husband's actions. On one hand, she comforted the woman, but on the other hand, she was in extreme pain. Her body, having just given birth, could not bear it, and she developed a fever that night. When her husband returned, having enjoyed himself to the fullest, her big sister was almost at her last breath. She recovered after several months of medical treatment, but her physical health never fully recovered. After that, her husband's behavior deteriorated further. He was never at home, and his monthly financial support for the family gradually decreased. However, no matter how difficult things were, her big sister always did her best to maintain the family without complaint. Later, her big sister had two more children, and the family's situation became even more difficult. The year before last, due to the economic downturn, all government agencies were downsizing and cutting salaries, implementing austerity measures. Her husband was laid off under these circumstances. He tried hard to find work in various places for several months, but to no avail. The family really couldn't survive in that situation, so they moved back to their hometown. Her big sister, with the help of friends, found a teaching position locally. As for her husband, his pride prevented him from finding any work in their hometown. Now, her husband is unemployed at home, feeling very depressed and falling ill every few days. Her big sister, on the other hand, goes to teach during the day and has to take care of four children and their father when she returns. Moreover, there is also an elderly couple to care for. How could she not look haggard? As she said this, Ping's eyes were already moist, and she had nothing more to say.</p>
<p>Returning, I felt boundless anger, as if I had just had an argument with someone! Should a woman be so submissive, exchanging her own happiness for the tribulations of men? Is this endless burden and myriad sorrows the reward society offers to a virtuous woman? Whose fault is this?</p>

<p>Facial Swelling and Eye Puffiness</p>
<p>Question No. 34, Ms. Yu Jingfen asks: (1) I am twenty years old this year. Before the age of fifteen, I was very weak. Although I am now a bit heavier than before, on average, I have eye puffiness and facial swelling, dizziness, and abdominal bloating for twenty days out of each month. My eyes were originally very good, but when they swell, the eye sockets shrink, and my face becomes bloated. My digestion is poor. (2) Is there any way to prevent facial swelling and eye puffiness? (3) I usually drink more than ten cups of strong tea a day. Is this related to the swelling? (4) Or is it because I spend too much time looking down while writing? (5) Is my blood impure? (Because I eat cold things during my menstrual period.) (6) Am I not getting enough sleep? (I sleep about seven hours a day.) (7) Are there any self-treatment methods? (8) What should I eat on a regular basis?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) You have "primary nephritis." (2) Rest and stay calm, pay attention to your diet—drink less water, avoid salt, sugar, fried foods, meat, eggs, milk, and tofu. Eat at least two eggs a day—rest in bed for several days. Medication can be used, but, alas, please forgive me, I originally had some very effective medicines, however, I really don't dare to recommend them, because these medicines should definitely not be bought and taken casually by patients themselves—the dosage is too related to the cure or aggravation of the disease. So I can only answer you this much here. You should see a doctor and have them prescribe the medication for you! (3) It is related. Strong tea stimulates the kidneys. (4) It is not related. (5) It is not related. However, you should pay attention to hygiene during your menstrual period, and it is not appropriate to eat cold things. (6) Seven hours of sleep is not insufficient. (7) See (2). (8) See (2).</p>
<p>Please forgive me. I am definitely not being secretive. I believe you are very understanding and can understand my difficulties. In fact, I only dare to recommend some harmless medicines here. I dare not casually recommend medicines that are harsh and can be dangerous if used improperly.</p>
<p>Children's Questions</p>
<p>Question No. 35, Mr. Fan Yousan of No. 96 Jishan Lane, Weihaiwei Road, asks: My second daughter is eleven years old this year. At the age of nine, she developed a strange condition: no matter what illness she has, she vomits violently, throwing up white phlegm, yellow liquid, and green liquid. After vomiting, she faints and speaks deliriously. In mild cases, she faints once, but in severe cases, she wakes up and faints again, up to ten or more times. Her suffering is unbearable, leading to a weak body and a tendency to not develop properly. I have consulted many famous doctors, who say it is a stomach problem, but they have not been able to eliminate the root cause. When she is not sick, she eats like a normal person, and she does not vomit or feel pain after eating. However, she does not sleep well at night, is very timid, and is different from other children. In the past two years, she had two attacks per month, but this year, the attacks occur every three or four months. Although the attacks have decreased, I still hope to find a way to eliminate the root cause. I have heard that you are very knowledgeable. Could you please show me the cause and treatment, and publish it in the newspaper so that those suffering from this condition at home and abroad can have a savior!</p>
<p>Answer: Your daughter may have two possible conditions: one is "parasitic worms" and the other is "epilepsy." Without examination, I dare not make a rash judgment. Please bring your daughter's stool for examination, and I will respond then. If it is "parasitic worms," using "deworming methods" should not be difficult to cure completely. As for the medications used, I dare not be stingy with the information, but I am in the same difficult position as in the previous answer and cannot fulfill your request. If the stool does not reveal any worm eggs, then it is "epilepsy." In this case, taking three grams of "Bromagsin" daily may lead to a cure.</p>
<p>Dirty Tongue and Bad Breath</p>
<p>Question No. 36, Ms. Xie Junying of Guangyu Lane, Qiujiang Road Intersection, Baoshan Road, asks: I have long suffered from bad breath, but treatment has been ineffective. My tongue coating is thick and sticky, and my appetite has decreased. However, I have no diseases in my mouth. (1) What medications should I use? (2) What is the cause of this disease?</p>
<p>Answer: Madam, it is not a disease in your mouth, but a stomach disease, which is "indigestion." Taking "Aceiose-pep-sin" three times a day, two tablets after each meal, can cure it. (2) Indigestion can be primary, secondary, or nervous in origin; it can also be divided into hyperacidity, hypoacidity, and lack of gastric acid. Without examining your gastric fluid and general physical condition, it is really impossible to explain the cause.</p>
<p>Cloudy Urine</p>
<p>Question No. 37, Mr. Yin Senqing of No. 23 Lanxin Lane, Bai'er Road, French Concession, asks: During my youth, I had a habit of masturbating for six or seven years, resulting in "sexual neurasthenia." Although I have tried to take care of myself for seven or eight years, I still get short of breath, tired eyes, and a headache when I move around. I have nocturnal emissions three or four times a month.</p>
<p>About five months ago, after having unclean sexual intercourse, I suddenly developed "prostate leakage (?)." I feel tired and weak, and have a poor appetite. Although I have injected "Dasisto (?), "thirty or more times, and recently injected 3 CC of 2% potassium mineralization (?) intravenously more than ten times, I still feel tired and weak. The discharge in my urine does not disappear. Each time I urinate, there are one or two thread-like substances. Walking slightly makes me feel even more tired, and my urine is cloudy. If I put it in a glass for two or three minutes, the cloudy substances either sink or float, appearing cloud-like. Please tell me (1) Which injectable drug is most effective for "sexual neurasthenia" and how many times should I inject it? (2) What is the short-term cure for "prostate leakage"? (3) Are the cloudy substances protein from the kidneys? What is the cure?</p>
<p>Answer: Mr. Yan, it is not known whether you have "prostate leakage." According to your letter, it does not seem like "prostate leakage," but rather like "chronic gonorrhea." However, this is only clear to Mr. Yan himself. As doctors, without examining you, just looking at a few sentences on the letter, we really cannot say for sure what the disease is. (1) The treatment of "sexual neurasthenia" mainly relies on hygiene. Mr. Yan says he has been "taking care of himself for seven or eight years," but it is not known whether his methods are correct. If the methods are not correct, what is the benefit of doing so? (2) Massage, cold sitz baths, direct current therapy, and oral "Bromagsin." (3) It is not protein. If Mr. Yan's "prostate leakage" is confirmed, the cloudiness is sperm strands, prostate epithelium, and semen. There is protein, but it cannot be seen by Mr. Yan's eyes without testing. The treatment is simply to cure the original disease. This is just a symptom, and it will naturally be cured at the same time. If the original disease is not cured, there is no benefit to getting rid of the cloudy substances. However, if Mr. Yan must have medication to cure it, take "Uvarsol" and "Citropin."</p>
<p>Fear of Nocturnal Emissions</p>
<p>Question No. 38, Mr. Ma Ruxin asks: I am only a seventeen-year-old child, and I have only developed this year (?). Regrettably, because I saw obscene pictures and books, and heard obscene words from people, I was tricked into having obscene thoughts and gradually started masturbating. Unexpectedly, in recent days, I have been discharging semen at night, which others call "nocturnal emissions." I am extremely frightened, because my lifelong happiness may be lost. Therefore, I have no choice but to ask you, sir, to tell me in detail: (1) What self-treatment methods are there? (2) What will be the result if I do not treat it?</p>
<p>Answer: Masturbation is indeed not good. However, masturbation is not a disease. The reason is your obscene thoughts. You do not have the ability to restrain yourself. Therefore, whether you can quit in the future depends on whether you have the determination to quit! Obscene thoughts are a common phenomenon for every young person in their spring awakening period. If they do not have such thoughts, they are not a healthy young person. However, these thoughts are entirely based on a mysterious idea of the opposite sex. The only way to correct this at this time is to look at a physiology and anatomy book to break this mysterious idea. If I say this too vaguely, it will definitely lead you astray, because the books in general bookstores are supposed to instill sexual knowledge, but in reality, they cater to the psychology of young people, selling sex histories in a disguised form. I am afraid that you will not understand books that are too scholarly, and books that are too superficial fall into the category I mentioned above. The compromise is to go to Guangxie Bookstore at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road to buy a physiology and anatomy atlas. After reading it, you will definitely realize that your current behavior is ridiculous. (1) "Nocturnal emissions" are a physiological phenomenon experienced by every healthy male. However, the first nocturnal emission often causes fear. You should not be afraid. One or two times a month will not harm your health. If the frequency is high, you can take "Bromagsin," thirty drops before bed. (2) See (1). If the frequency is too high, such as once or twice a week, there is a risk of developing "sexual neurasthenia" if it is not treated.</p>
<p>Chronic Dysentery</p>
<p>Question No. 39, Mr. Zhao Wang of Jincheng Printing and Stationery Company, No. 111, Mei Baige Road, asks: My father is fifty-three years old. Since 1930, he has suffered from red dysentery, but it does not contain blood (?). His stool is like the dregs of sesame oil, red and foamy. He wants to sit on the stool every ten minutes, and his abdominal pain is extreme. His anus feels like it shrinks and cannot move down. Please tell me what medicine he should use.</p>
<p>Answer: Your father's illness is very easy to cure. It only takes one week to recover. However, a stool examination must be performed before treatment, because there are two types of dysentery—"amoebic" and "bacterial." The symptoms of the two diseases are the same, but the causes and treatments are completely different. If it is diagnosed as bacterial, taking "Dphage" is most effective. If it is amoebic, injecting "Brometine" can also cure it. If there is really no way and there are various difficulties in performing a stool examination, take four "Tryterin" pills three times a day.</p>
<p>Stubborn Constipation</p>
<p>Question No. 40, Mr. Zhu Cuilin asks: I have long suffered from stubborn constipation. I only have a bowel movement every seven or eight days, and my stool is dry and hard, causing extreme pain. Laxatives have been ineffective, and I have no way to cure it.</p>
<p>Answer: Eat more vegetables, oils, drink cold boiled water, and eat more fruits. The most important thing is to develop a habit. Get up every morning and sit on the toilet, even if you don't have a bowel movement. Use "Giyceol" medicine by squeezing it into the anus.</p>
<p>Broken and Ulcerated Urethra</p>
<p>Question No. 41, Mr. Zhong of No. 75 Disiwei Road asks: (1) Several days ago, I went out for pleasure, and there is an ulcerated area inside my foreskin. It does not hurt when I don't move it, but it hurts when I wash it with medicinal water. What is this condition? (2) Is a soft chancre needed to have 606 injections?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Since the ulcer appeared after this period, it is very likely to be a hard chancre. Please test your blood to clear your doubts. (2) Soft chancre does not need to have 606.</p>

<h3>Wuhua (Militarization)</h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>Professor Lei Zonghai has an article in the fourth issue of the first volume of Social Sciences entitled "A Culture Without Soldiers." Mr. Junheng of Independent Criticism specially summarized and supplemented his theory, titling it "Building a Culture With Soldiers." I think that although this title is semantically correct, the wording is rather cumbersome. It would be better to use the four characters "Building Wuhua (Militarization)," which is more concise and direct.</p>
<p>Professor Lei said that the history before the Qin Dynasty was one of autonomy and self-determination. The people were able and willing to be soldiers and were responsible for the country. After the Qin Dynasty, the people were unable and unwilling to be soldiers and were not responsible for the country. Therefore, everything was not autonomous and was completely subject to the natural and human environment. Such a completely passive culture is mainly characterized by the absence of real soldiers, which means the absence of citizens, which means the absence of government life. Therefore, simply put, there is only a passive culture and no active Wuhua (militarization).</p>
<p>Therefore, Mr. Junheng said that the distinction between pre-Qin and post-Qin mentioned here can be said to be the distinction between conscription and a volunteer army system. A culture without soldiers is a natural result of the volunteer army system, and a culture with soldiers is a natural result of the conscription system. The merits and demerits, advantages and disadvantages of these two systems do not need to be drawn from historical facts, and their pros and cons can be judged. As the saying goes, "If you want kindness to be solid, you must do it yourself." There is nothing in the world that relies on others that can be relied on.</p>
<p>In the volunteer army system, the purpose of the soldiers is only money and they do not know how to love the country. Therefore, there is an ancient saying, "Eat the rations but don't care about the affairs." In the conscription system, the soldiers originally volunteer, and their purpose is to love the country and not money. Comparing the two, the distance between them is like heaven and earth. The reason why a country becomes a country is originally based on land, people, and politics as essential elements. Therefore, domestic security and organization are entirely maintained by politics, etiquette, and law, while foreign aggression is entirely defended by military force. Therefore, all citizens of the country have the responsibility to preserve the territory, the responsibility to protect the people, and the responsibility to protect national sovereignty. Therefore, protecting the territory, protecting the people, and protecting national sovereignty ultimately means protecting oneself and one's family.</p>
<p>If one can view the survival of a country as one views the survival of oneself and one's family, and treat the enemies of the country as one treats the enemies of oneself and one's family, then the culture must be changed to Wuhua (militarization), and a weak country will become a strong country. The key lies in this. Those who belong to the general home-of-the-world faction, in view of the many domestic ambitious individuals who are difficult to control, therefore strongly advocate culture but do not advocate Wuhua (militarization), abandon conscription and use a volunteer army system. Therefore, for two thousand years, China has always been either entirely or partially ruled by foreign ethnic groups, or barely autonomous and must endure deep foreign insults. It can be seen that the previous policies were all policies to defend against domestic thieves, while neglecting the policies to defend against foreign thieves, so a big mistake was made.</p>
<p>Since the habit of emphasizing culture and devaluing military force is deeply rooted in people's hearts, and the volunteer army system has been in place for a long time, the people believe that the disasters and turmoil of the country have nothing to do with the people, and the survival of the country also has nothing to do with the people, so the country is beyond salvation. However, the conscription system was also implemented in the late Qing Dynasty, but with no results. Why? The former conscription was a free-style conscription, not a forced conscription. Serving as a soldier was voluntary and not forced. The current conscription should use a national military system to force conscription. Everyone has the obligation to be a soldier, and everyone has the responsibility to defend the country. It is a matter of course that the people of a country should protect the country, and there is no room for shirking responsibility.</p>
<p>If a national military system is implemented, then everyone can know how to love the country, and everyone who knows how to love the country can know how to protect it. Only then can people and the country have a connection. Now, most countries in the world have a national military system and are all militaristic. Therefore, in this militaristic environment, if you want to escape the oppression and disturbance of militarism, you must use militarism. How else can you save the country? How else can you establish a country?</p>
<h3>Guerilla Warfare</h3>
<p>— Guo Ka</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>Bang! …</p>
<p>Standing on the watchtower on the large wall in front of the village, holding the gun, through the intersecting tree trunks, following the silver-white river under the moonlight, pulling the trigger under the index finger, the vast wilderness shattered like a piece of silk, followed by a rustling echo. In the rustling echo, you could still hear a swooshing sound, disappearing along the winding river into the hazy horizon.</p>
<p>Then there was an unusual silence, and the gurgling of the fish weirs in the river came clearly to the ears.</p>
<p>This was a kind of enjoyment, an enjoyment in another setting. The sons of the landlords in this village were all excellent marksmen. Every night, in those young people's refined pastimes, the vast wilderness was often subdued by this violent sound.</p>
<p>That night, after the gunshot, a gatekeeper, a big dark man, shouted:</p>
<p>"What a great shot!"</p>
<p>As he shouted, the man approached, a large gun tucked under his arm, appearing black in the shadows at the base of the wall.</p>
<p>"Is the young master going on a guerrilla raid?"</p>
<p>"Who's got the guts?"</p>
<p>The one called the young master took out the bullet belt, pushed it into the "top fire," set the safety, and then shouted in a self-important manner.</p>
<p>"There are plenty of people tonight, there's the Third and Second Young Masters from the west gate, Cousin Jin from Jinjiabao, and your guards... as many as you want."</p>
<p>"Good, I'll go change to a box cannon."</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Rustle, rustle, rustle, the monotonous sound of footsteps, accompanied by a row of cloud-like shadows under the moonlight, hurriedly swept past the roadside. These shadows were sometimes swallowed by the shadows of the sorghum fields on the south side of the road, and sometimes stuck to the millet fields on the north side. Once on the wider dirt road, you could see people carrying box cannons, thumbs on the firing pins, others carrying rifles diagonally, fingers in the trigger guards. No one said a word easily, only the creaking sound of the sorghum growing upward.</p>
<p>A group of people left the village, followed the small path westward for more than a mile, then turned south, walked down a slope, and followed the riverbank back eastward.</p>
<p>The riverbank was covered with clusters of willow trees, and a dense little forest. From time to time, wild birds would flutter out of the forest, and leaves with dew would suddenly stick to people's faces.</p>
<p>Everyone " " squeezed a handful of sweat, and came out of the forest. Someone imitated the tone of the dark man and said:</p>
<p>"What a damn dangerous place!"</p>
<p>People's hearts relaxed, and a little light appeared on their faces. In front was a round earth covered by the sky, and the summer rain wind gently caressed people's chests.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>About half a mile downstream on the beach, two people were fishing. The older one had a small braid coiled on his head, and his two twig-like arms were hanging a net, watching the rippling water surface. The net was swung twice in his hands and then flew out. The old man maintained the posture of practicing Tai Chi, watching until the net completely covered the water, then squatted down and slowly collected the net. At this time, there was a large circle on the water surface where the net had just been cast, gradually rippling and disappearing into the distance.</p>
<p>To the left, a young man was bending over, picking up the net. The muddy water from the bottom of the net kept splashing onto his camel-hoof-like bare feet and club-like calves. He picked up the net and said:</p>
<p>"This net is a waste, there isn't even a shadow of a fish! -- Oh, leaves, broken shoes, -- not bad, there's a small shrimp..."</p>
<p>He cleaned it up and threw the net into the water, rinsing it. Looking up, he saw that the old man had already pulled up the net, and he asked:</p>
<p>"How is it?"</p>
<p>"It depends on fate!"</p>
<p>"Uncle Yinzi, we have to move. Look! That carp is showing off in front of us (1), coming to the surface of the water to bully people!"</p>
<p>"Keep your voice down, or the village will start shooting sooner or later!" He picked up the net, drawing out his tone: "When I was young, there seemed to be more fish, and it was easier to catch them. Now, you have to sneak around at night to fish. Good heavens, a big rock! The village will shoot if they hear us, not to mention encountering bandits (2)! --" He paused slightly, then lowered his voice and said: "I said there's probably someone above, the sandpipers (3) are rising!"</p>
<p>Both of them cocked their ears to listen. The air was very quiet, the water in the river flowed gurgling, and the sandpipers chirped in the sky.</p>
<p>After a while, the young man stammered to speak, but the old man quickly waved his hand, suppressing his voice and saying:</p>
<p>"Someone's coming!"</p>
<p>Both of them turned around, bent over, and peered in the direction of the footsteps.</p>
<p>Not far away, from the forest, the sound of a group of people walking came faintly.</p>
<p>The old man almost whispered:</p>
<p>"This is bad! Encountering fishermen is a huge taboo!"</p>
<p>The old man slowly rolled into the river, crawled into the deep water, leaving only his head exposed. The young man thought: That's not necessarily a good idea! He felt a bit of curiosity, and believed that his hands and feet could still run fast enough, so he crept to hide behind a bush, but forgot that the white cloth vest he was wearing was most conspicuous at night.</p>
<p>On the other side, the group of people, after walking out of the forest, relaxed and walked along the riverbank in the peanut fields, or sparse woods, occasionally someone would tell a joke, look at the scenery, or dig up a few peanut plants. As they were walking, the big dark man in the front suddenly turned around, bent over, his hands spread on his ribs in a turtle-like posture, and said softly:</p>
<p>"There's someone ahead,"</p>
<p>Everyone became nervous, held their guns horizontally in their hands, released the safety, and advanced in a posture ready to fire at any time.</p>
<p>The big dark man shouted loudly at the white shadow hiding behind the bush.</p>
<p>Immediately, the shadow was startled like a rabbit, and ran down the slope.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, the one called the young master raised the box cannon and fired two shots.</p>
<p>The shadow stumbled and fell.</p>
<p>On this side, leaving two people as outposts, the rest gathered around. The young man was lying face down, fresh blood oozing from the vest on his back. A man bent down, took a closer look at the dead man's face, and exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Isn't this Wan Si's son from West Village?"</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned. Someone woodenly uttered a sentence</p>
<p>"What's he doing here?"</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it, anyone who dies under a gun is a bandit!"</p>
<p>These words were said by the one called the young master, and he had an idea.</p>
<p>Before long, the sound of footsteps gradually faded away, and the wilderness returned to silence. The silver little fish in the willow baskets on the beach shone brightly under the moonlight.</p>
<p>Note (1): That is, small carp.</p>
<p>(2): "Bandits" are bandits, and encountering fishermen is a taboo for bandits. In this situation, fishermen are often killed.</p>
<p>(3): That is, sand gulls.</p>
<h3>A Soldier in the Confinement Room</h3>
<p>— Shi Hua</p>
<p>"We'll all have such a day..." Debiao squeezed Hugen's leg hard again. Several guns leaned against the wall, several pieces of gun-cleaning cloth torn to shreds, the oil bottle almost falling to the ground, they didn't even clean their guns, the two lay diagonally across the bed. This room was dark! Completely dark. No sunlight during the day, no light at night.</p>
<p>"There you go again, be careful of Baldy Wang," Hugen hurriedly pushed his hand away in fear.</p>
<p>"You're afraid of him, but I'm not. See if he can be filial for the rest of his life! Damn it, I'll beat him to death."</p>
<p>"Why are you cursing again for no reason? I'm asking you, what exactly did you do to get sent in here?" Hugen lay even more diagonally, almost reclining on the bed. Debiao sat up energetically.</p>
<p>"Isn't it all because of that damned Huaniang? That woman is really too pretty. Otherwise, we're not blind, would we be jealous of Platoon Leader Wang, that little bastard?"</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>"Huaniang, why didn't you bring my pants? Did you give them to your wild husband?"</p>
<p>"Drop dead."</p>
<p>"Oh! What's this red thing? You wore these pants, didn't you? You must have worn them, otherwise, where did this come from?" Chen Huzi held the pants in front of her, wanting her to see, and pinched her apple-like face.</p>
<p>"Drop dead, you'll die soon." No matter when, no matter what they did to her, she always scolded them with a smile. In their hearts, this was the best music, nothing could compare. They were afraid she wouldn't scold them. After she scolded them, their whole body felt hundreds of pounds lighter, and all the day's fatigue was released in this smiling scolding.</p>
<p>"Huaniang's washed clothes smell so good, just like her..." Before he could finish speaking, Lao Xu pounced over, secretly, no, rather than secretly, it was more like forcibly kissing her face, and ran away in a puff of smoke. This made them laugh. They weren't laughing at the action, because this was commonplace. They were laughing because Huaniang's face had a pile of sesame seeds. It turned out that Lao Xu was still eating sesame cakes, but he fired the first shot so quickly, printing the sesame seeds on his face and lips onto her delicate face.</p>
<p>Huaniang scolded again:</p>
<p>"Drop dead, you'll die soon."</p>
<p>"Stop fooling around, let people go." Debiao played the "fake good guy."</p>
<p>"Debiao, you don't have any clothes to wash today?" She was grateful, so she specially asked him.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, I'll bring them over slowly."</p>
<p>Huaniang left, giving them a deep smile as she left.</p>
<p>"I'll come to your house to play tonight." He said with a smirk.</p>
<p>"Come if you want."</p>
<p>"Eight o'clock, definitely eight o'clock." He held her arm and refused to let go.</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>This was a moonlit night, the banana-like moon came out very early, and the stars were especially bright, as if afraid that Debiao couldn't see the road clearly, shining on the earth.</p>
<p>Debiao walked forward slowly with a suspicious heart. Will she really be good to me? Probably not, isn't she very nice to Platoon Leader Wang? No, maybe she will, otherwise why would she agree to me? This little vixen is really obedient, he thought.</p>
<p>He walked, getting closer and closer. He recognized the door very well, although he had never been inside. Some light shone out from the door. He thought she had been waiting for him for a long time, and must be very anxious in her heart. Why don't I go in quickly?</p>
<p>He went in without hesitation.</p>
<p>"Ah!" He wanted to pull his foot back, but it was too late.</p>
<p>"Li Debiao, what are you doing here?" Platoon Leader Wang jumped up from the bed suddenly.</p>
<p>"Report to Platoon Leader: I...I..."</p>
<p>"What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>"I came to deliver the clothes to be washed,"</p>
<p>"Where are the clothes?"</p>
<p>"Uh——"</p>
<p>The next day, Li Debiao was sent to the confinement room.</p>
<p>The order came down saying: After investigation, Platoon Leader Wang Biao has performed meritorious service in managing his subordinates, and is awarded a major commendation to show encouragement...</p>

<h3>Author of "The Gay Lord Donnell"</h3>
<h3>A Letter to Warner Bros. Officials</h3>
<p>Warner's long-awaited giant film "The Gay Lord Donnell" has been released in Daguangming. When the film was completed, the original author, Hervey Allen, was very satisfied after watching it. In his letter to the Associate Manager of Warner Bros. and the film's producer, Jack Warner, he said: "This film, to those of us who have seen 'The Gay Lord Donnell' on stage over the years, is a miracle. When I discovered that the novel had achieved such a great success on the screen, I could not suppress the joy and comfort in my heart. No one knows more clearly than I do that moving 'The Gay Lord Donnell' from book to screen is one of the most difficult tasks. At this time, I am very sorry that I cannot congratulate and thank the people who worked hard for this film, but in any case, I will never forget Mr. Mervyn LeRoy's sensitive directing skills. He not only made the whole film extremely successful in form, but also conveyed the soul and atmosphere of the story. I must thank all the actors in the cast with the greatest respect, they were all able to give Mr. LeRoy great help..." After reading this letter, we can know the success of this film.</p>
