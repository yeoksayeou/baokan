<p>日人强佔經過　據并公安局向該地記者發表談話、則此事完全由日人武田末雄及田中芳太郎强佔民房而起、緣并市按司街有四號房屋一所、曾於本年七月二十六日有冀人王俊德、向房主接洽租賃該房居住、說定房租每月五十元、先交定洋十元、並言明須照章覓妥實舖保、立具租房契約摺、始得移入居住、王某去後多日、迄未覓到舖保、乃以欺騙手段向街長副聲稱、已租定該房、請街長蓋章、轉呈市政公所、准予油刷門面、市政公所因有街長副蓋章、卽照例批准、於是王俊德卽着手修理門面、房主以其尚未履行找保立摺手續、拒絕修理門面、並聲明按晋省法令、以房租人居住、如發現房客有販賣毒品情事、房產卽須充公、你旣係開藥舖、又找不到舖保、卽不能佔我的房屋等語、從此王某卽由未露面、忽於十月五日、日人武田末雄田中芳太郎二人、强住該房、房主恐係王俊德對日人有所欺騙、卽先向日人說明此房王俊德說租未成、你們來住是何原因、該二日人不予回答、房主無法、卽找警察、先以口頭通知該二日人、仍不答復、後以書面通知、該二日人仍擲地不閱、旋雖書面通知騰抄一份、但仍佔據不走、經交涉二十餘日之久、該二日人始終盤據不走、公安局始按强佔民房、有碍秩序、於十月二一日將該武田末雄連同房主訴狀、護送鄭州日本領事館法辦、此是案經過之詳情、</p>
<p>房主呈控訴狀　至房主呈控該日人等之訴狀則稱、竊本房主在本市按司街四號有房院一所、兩月前有王俊德者、口頭接洽、欲租用此房、並謂先行油刷門面、一面取具妥實舖保、成立信約、乃時經月餘、該王俊德對於立約打保等手續、並不履行、近且潛逃不面、本房主正擬遷入自住、突於十月五日、有日人武田末雄及田中芳太郎二人、搬入該房中、盤距不去、聲稱久住、擬設商店、本房主以其無理取鬧、令速退出、該日人態度强硬、非佔不可、屢次催令退出、槪置不理、經本房主其傢具移置房外、交警保管、應請貴局速派警勒令搬出、否則爲維護產權計、卽行以自力排除、屆時如有妨害公安之處、亦所難顧特此聲明、再該日人强佔房屋、妨害他人行駛權利、實屬有犯刑章、卽貴局無管轄權、亦應隨送有管轄之日本領事館、依法懲辦、以維治安、爲此謹呈太原市市公安局局長程、房主代表人李象恒、廿五日、</p>

<p>在二十五年度的支出預算中，占着萬萬元以上的大支出，有軍務費，債務費，與補助費的三種，軍費爲三萬二千二百餘萬元，債務費爲二萬三千九百餘萬元，補助費爲一萬零六百餘萬元，這三者合計，已占總支出六七，三%。而其餘黨務國務等費，實在都不過是極小的數字而已，因此要談節流，首先就應該集中目光到軍，債，補的三種經費，研究其是否有减少的可能。</p>
<p>關於軍務費，我先得把中國軍務費的一點特質指出來。這就是中國軍務的消費，大部分費於軍隊的給養，而很少有用於軍器之設備的。目前中國有多少兵，詳細不甚知道，大槪决不下二百萬人，假定每兵每月餉二萬四千萬元，加以軍官的俸給，統計官兵的給養就須三萬萬元左右，因此每年三萬二千餘萬元的軍務費，事實上只能充給養費用而已，至於軍器之購備，已經是毫無着落。在這裏我想曾有人要反問中國軍隊不也有飛機大砲嗎？要解釋這個疑問，我們就要指出，預算中軍費雖然只有二萬萬元，實則在文化教育費與建設費中，也還包含着一部分軍事性質費用，又一萬萬元以上的補助費，都是各　截留的國家收入，而其中一部分也是充地方軍隊用的。因此，軍務費名義上雖僅三萬萬元，實則遠在二萬萬元以上。中國目前軍務費支出雖然是這樣龐大，但軍事上的物質設備是很貧乏的。因此，要軍費節流，只能節省軍士的給養費，第一個前提要减少兵士人數，假若不裁兵而减給養費，爲事實所不可能，然而，在目前中國的內外環境下，裁兵談何容易。</p>
<p>關於債務費的支出，經過今年二月公債强制借換以後大體上已比去年度减少了三千五百餘萬元。本來，在這種年頭，賴債已是國際間普遍流行的手段，在中國目前這樣財政困難的時候似乎也不妨暫緩支付，然而中國却「中流砥柱」似的做硬好漢。這種現象，自然也有其原因的，因爲中國在財政的見地上所賴於內外債的幫助之處正多，所以，對於債　的維持上，不能不付以很大的代價。</p>
<p>至於大支出第三種的補助費，我在前面已說過是由各省截留國家收入所構成，而非中央眞正的一種支出，因此節流就根本談不到。不僅這樣，年來各省的地方財政，事實上較中央尤爲困難關於地方財政，在筆者最近寫的一本中國敗政之病態及其批判小冊子中有一個解剖，該書在生活書店刷印中，因此，各省截留國稅的現象恐怕還要更顯著，而補助費項目中的數字，當然也怕會隨之而更增加吧。</p>
<p>這樣三件大的經費都不能節約，那末，其他數百萬元數千萬元節構成一項支出的數目，當然更難以减了，縱令能减，所减又無補於事的。</p>
<p>綜上所述，最　將來中國的財政上，二萬萬元以上的不足額，是已經確定無疑的了。在財政的支出上，不但目前，卽令將來，也是無法節約而求平衡的，至於稅收方面，恐怕也只會减少。在這種情形之下，我們只能虔誠的希望當局，能够從速的有一個更善良的策劃出來，不必一定固持着十八個月後財政得以平衡的約言。因爲照目前的現狀，假能一定要靠法幣政策來平衡財政收支，除掉迪貨膨脹一策以外，已無別法了。然而通貨膨脹畢竟是危險的。「學者們的」有限制通貨膨脹一說　完全是口　脹上的胡　，以通貨膨紙來平衡財政收支，而尚能有限制，這是人間之奇跡了。</p>
<p>最後，還有些說明，目前之財政，實已至於十分困難之地步，倘若政府不能阜日有一個理財之新方策，那末，縱令政府不打算拿法幣政策來平衡財政收支，但財政收支的不平衡，恐怕也會不得已而影響法幣政策的亦卽不得已而衹有走入於通貨膨脹這條路的。因爲法幣政策實行以後，紙幣發行已具有了極大的伸縮性，根據「抗力最小之原則，」政府平衡財政的時候，與其走吃力多而效果小的增稅公債政策，往往容易就採用紙幣政策，又何况目前中國財政上，增稅旣不可能，公債發行亦有限度呢（完）</p>

<h3 id="c44">如何捍耳綏邊 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>自從蒙匪迭决侵擾綏邊都被傅作義部擊退以後綏遠境內似乎平靜了一時但是歷史的經騐吿訴我們大動盪中的安靜常常是事態更趨惡化的伏綫果然綏遠的局勢最近又隨着平津日軍的大舉演習而緊張起來某方所策動的偽軍李守信部進抵商都督促王英騎匪向西進展陶林與和附近已經發生步哨衝突同時某方供給的大批軍火運到商都綏東天空時有某方飛機偵察正式戰爭的開始恐怕只是時間問題罷了</p>
<p>綏遠現已成了國防的第一綫所處的地位不消說是非常重要的橫貫境內的平綏鐵路從包頭經歸綏集寗大同張家口而達北平和長城以內的交通網發生密切的連繋鐵路的北面聳峙着大靑山構成綏遠東北的高原這在戰略上的地位也很重要現在偽軍和傅作義將軍部下對峙的地方就在綏東沿大靑山和察綏邊境一帶這是綏遠的門戶要是不守的話則不但綏遠全省難保就是冀察晋陝甘寗和外蒙也都要感到很大的威脅了</p>
<p>誰都知道偽軍侵綏是某方早所决定的計劃如果某方利用偽軍把綏遠佔據起來在一方面可向西南推進侵略晋陝控制同蒲正太諸路完成對華北五省軍事上的包圍錢更渡河而趨畏安擾及西北的中心都市在另一方面則可向西推進侵略寗夏越賀蘭山經阿拉蕃旗而至新疆以包圍外蒙所以綏遠的存亡實在關係着全中國的存亡這從某方的大陸政策上我們很容易明白的</p>
<p>國家領土主權的完整我們非竭力來保持不可何况綏遠是華北和西北的門戶現在駐守綏遠的傅作義將軍已一再宜言决死守國土如敵軍敢侵入綏境則必率健兒予以痛擊這種誠摯的捍衛國士的表示很足敬佩但是敵人犯綏旣有遠大的計劃我們還得作更周密的應付就大體說政府方面必須竭力充實綏遠防軍的力量人民方面必須抱定一致的决心給傅作義將軍等各種有力的援助這已成為我們當前必要的義務了</p>

<p>近八九日以來，因日軍大舉演習，平津通豐一帶，早入於阢隍不安狀態，北平四郊，亦久已鷄犬不寗，草木皆兵。惟北平城內市面，因處於各國使館監察之下，尙能保持平常情祝。雖終日隱聞砲聲，而歌舞昇平，一仍其舊。但日軍向平市居民示威之意，並未放棄。是以，在其「秋操」結束之前一日。（三號），乃有穿城遊行之舉。</p>
<p>遊行路綫，係由城東北角之朝陽門進城，經繁盛區域之東四，東單，東西長安街，西單，等地，至西單時，分為二股。一向南出宣武門，經彰儀門大街，出城西南角之廣安門：一向北，出城西北角之西直門。路錢之長，共約一二十里。遊行方式，乃完全模擬作戰之退却與追趕，前隊退却，後隊窮追。於此一退一追之中，乃寓有穿城遊行之意。</p>
<p>八時許，模擬戰敗退却之一隊，開始進朝陽門。當頭者，係小摩托車三輸，每輛坐二人一人開車，一人擎手機關槍。其後為轎式汽車三輛。每輛坐軍官三五，隱隱望去，唇間蓄短髭一撮者，佔其大半。在此之後，滿載日軍之大汽車，乃風馳電掣，連串而來。汽車之後，略有間斷，繼之者，又為小摩托車。此後，坦克車，大汽車，輜重車，小摩托車，轎式汽車，砲車等等，乃不斷馳來，或數輛成隊，或略有間隔，轟轟之聲，震耳欲聾。車塵揚處，馬路為之震動，屋宇為之顫搖。如是者共約三句鐘，直至十一點半鐘，始告完畢。統計各式車輛，約達百餘，官兵約一千五六百人，此類各式車輛，外體均一律漆為灰黃色，滿載兵卒之大汽車，全體以難草披掛，與作戰時防飛機轟炸之情形，逼眞逼肖。坦克車之頂，大率架有高射機關槍，一人踞其旁，作準備瞄射天空狀。官兵制服，悉為灰黃色，與車身顏色，完全相同。帶口罩帶眼鏡者甚多，而官長帽際之紅箍，鮮艷異常，於風沙滾滾中，最為令人觸目。並聞步兵數百人，由廣渠門入城。</p>
<p>凡日軍經過之處，沿街夾道，均擠滿觀衆，雖有巡警之驅趕，亦無濟於事。記者曾目擊一燒餅舖中之主僕三人，因相率至街旁觀看，致失去燒餅若干，而大起爭吵，又見一綢緞店，於彼時關上大門，全店出望，路上行人，除有念事外，亦大都立足以視，而顏色之間，大率　有愁悶。蓋任何富有鎮定力人物，於此車聲軋軋中，亦難安心理其生業。</p>
<p>「友邦」僑民，於此時，却大都興高彩烈，東單迤北，有「友邦」小學生數排，穿戴甚為整齊，彷彿如臨大典，於日軍馳過時，則高聲歡呼鼓掌，各私人住宅門口，亦都高懸其太陽形國旗，此中尤為令人注目者，共有三處，一為東單大街之藥店中和公司，一為同街之書店東亞公司，另一為王府并大街旁近之某商店，此三處所懸旗幟，闊大異常，而顏色嶄新，似類新製。穿戴整齊塗脂抹粉若駝峰之「友邦」婦女，拖起厚而闊之屐履，在街上往來如穿梭。其心中似有無限欣喜，無從發洩，令夾道觀看之我國同胞，側目不已。</p>
<p>於日軍車輛行列中，常有美國汽車，夾在其中。或為轎式汽車，中坐美國人士一二人，有時亦係美國婦女。據記者默計，中坐婦女一人，由自己開行者，共有三輛。此類美國人物，大約以新聞記者佔多數，外交界次之，普通僑民純為好奇心而追跟觀看者，恐不多。或為載重汽軍，上坐兵士三五，欹身蹺腿，時作笑容，此類載重汽車，夾於日軍車行列中者，約一二十輛。吾國人覩之，均於愁悶中略起興奮。常常報以苦笑，此種心理，當亦事理之常。據聞彼等亦在城外舉行演習，是日方回。記者走過東交民巷時，見其他各國僑民，亦紛紛走出，赴各處觀看，彼等關心日軍此次之游行，於茲可見。</p>

<p>上鐵爾登　下梵恩斯　（吳生良攝）</p>
<p>體育消息</p>
<h3 id="c82">世界職業綱球兩巨頭　鐵爾登梵恩斯昨抵滬　今午一時出塲表演　將於今晚乘原輪赴香港　馬尼拉表演後原輪返美 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>世界職菜網球界兩巨頭、一度執世界業餘網球牛耳之鐵爾登梵恩斯兩氏、及職業網球女選手夏泊女士、一行　人、於昨晨八時乘林肯總統號輪、自日本抵此、昨日忙於酬酢遊歷、今日下午一時起於聖母院路一五三發卡那凡洛球塲、兩氏將作一次售劵公開表演、今晚乘原輪赴香港轉馬尼拉、略述各悄如次、</p>
<p>提前抵滬</p>
<p>林肖輪原定今晨抵滬、提前一日、已於昨晨進口、往新關碼頭歡迎者、有本埠職業網球家卡那凡洛、主持此次營業之普達貿易公司西人泊爾　等、鐵等出新關碼頭後、卽直往國際大飯店休息、其時約九時有半、二人俱身材碩長、精神飽滿、絕無血行倦容、</p>
<p>昨日酬酢</p>
<p>昨日中午兩氏應福州路美國總會之宴，昨晚花旗繼曾亦設宴歡迎、晚九時併為靜安寺路新　之「沙愛樂」舞塲行開幕禮、不勝其忙、下午二時至四時、在聖母院路球塲、練習比賽、以舒筋骨、卡那凡洛及本埠諸擾秀麥格陶平現戴明發、亦俱參加</p>
<p>今日表演</p>
<p>今日下午一時起、兩氏在聖母院路一百五十三號勃洛克林球塲表演單打雙打各一組、夏泊小姐因無對手、不能出塲、表演秩序如下、</p>
<p>單打　鐵爾登對梵恩斯　三盤</p>
<p>雙打　戴明發　王妙松　對　蔡侯發　王妙興　二盤</p>
<p>雙打　鐵爾登　陶毛男　對　梵恩斯　卡那凡洛　三盤</p>
<p>梵恩斯談</p>
<p>梵思斯在旅次發表談話如下鐵梵二人、在東京共作表演四塲、每次觀衆俱在一萬人左右、離東京後、　遊名古屋大阪等處、續有表演、在日本曾舉行所謂指導」表演、僅用裁判員一人、日本第一名選手山岸、曾參加「指導」表演多次、據其觀察、山岸球藝當在全世界第八名至十五名之間、日本網球選手之擊法、日趨近代化、其唯一缺點、為缺少想像力與速度、至於世界職業網球之前途、對之甚為樂觀、惟業餘職業兩界之對抗、恐至少項五六年後、方能接觸、因目下職業網球會之組織、尙不足健全也、</p>
<p>世界業餘選手中、潘萊尙稍佔勃琪與克拉姆兩人之先、惟兩人進步殊速、終有一日得居潘萊之上也、英國能否保持明年之台維期杯，當視潘萊之是否保持業餘資格而定、美澳德機會平均、法國實力尙嫌不足、柯顯已較前進步、惟梵已兩年未遇柯顯、行程之計劃已定、在香港將有單打表演一塲、然後續往馬尼拉、至於南菲之行、恐難成事實、因雙方尙毫無接洽也、故馬尼拉表演後、仍重返美國、鐵爾登在美已排定比賽、梵恩斯亦亟欲歸家、視其妻女也、</p>
<p>鐵爾登談</p>
<p>據鐵爾登氏談、本人與梵氏等尙屬初次來遠東觀光、一切均覺生氣勃勃、此次在日本逗留約一月之久、在東京大阪名古屋等處、表演十餘次、頗蒙彼邦人士謬贊、中國網球一道、近年來亦有相當進步、本人從事網球、屈指已三十五年、自七歲在小學歸業時代、卽已樂此不疲以迄於今，旅記者復叩以澳洲之行、是否放棄、及歸途經滬時可再獻身手否、鐵氏謂澳洲之行、業已打銷、南行將以馬尼拉為終點、卽搭原輪歸國、　須於聖誕節　、趕返美國、故歸途能否躭攔、須到馬尼拉後、再行電告、預　在滬再表演一次、或可如願云、</p>
<p>鐵梵小史</p>
<p>鐵爾登今年四十三歲、於一九一九年十七歲時開始　綱球生活、在本雪凡尼亞大學攻讀時、已成為世界網球界有名人物之一在網球界稱雄達十七年之久、迄今仍為世界最强選手之一、一九二二年大學畢業、一九二〇年得全美單打錦標、連勝六年、至一九二六年才為法國拉柯斯德所敗、一九二七年復得之、一九二〇·二一及三〇年、共勝惠勃爾　錦標三次、最後一次時巳三十八歲、鐵成各時為二十八歲、</p>
<p>梵恩斯今年二十三歲、一九三一年十八歲時、卽得全美單打冠軍、一九三二年復得之、是年又得惠勃爾登冠軍、一十歲時結婚、專家之觀察、今日全球中、潘萊亦在其內、恐尙無能擊敗梵氏者、梵年事尙輕、前途尙遠大云、</p>

<p>— 蔣槐青</p>
<p>終身盡瘁於網球事業的鐵爾登，他的年齡已四十二歲零九個月了，至今還沒結過婚，當他在日本表演的時候，曾有一位新聞記者去訪問他，問他為什麼不結婚，鐵老含笑而搖其首，似乎對於這一問，很不以為然，反覺多事了。縱然結婚不足以影響他的事業，然而鐵老並不重視結婚這回事。的確，他的一身，　是與網球結下了不解之緣。</p>
<p>鐵爾登William　T·Tilden　2nd於一八九三年二月十日，生於美國Germanion，Pa，體高六呎二吋左右，體重一百六十磅許，六歲卽開始舉習網球，七歲卽得童子鍄標。道是鐵氏生平第一個勝利品。</p>
<p>鐵氏的少年時候，正當美國草地網球運動蓬勃的時期，耳濡目染，加以鐵氏的特殊天材，潛心研究，球藝一日千里。一九一八年他第一次達全美錦標的决賽，一九一九年又得决賽權，而敗於瓊斯頓。一九二〇年起一躍居全美錦標，同時又得英國惠勃爾登冠軍，而執世界之牛耳。從此鐵氏英名，驚震世界。翌年又得惠勃爾登第二次錦標，一九二二年至一九二七年速得全美錦標凡六年。</p>
<p>鐵氏連居美國網球十傑表第一凡十年之多，（一九二一－一九三〇）並代表出席台維斯杯比賽凡十一年（一九二〇至一九三〇）道是各國網球家所未有的紀錄，鐵氏被稱為網球界的怪傑，眞是各符其實。一九二〇至一九二六年間，美國連得台維斯杯七年的榮譽，這不能不　功於鐵氏，他身兼單雙打選手，並任隊長之職。在這數年中，鐵爾登保持常勝軍的威風，從未為任何選手擊敗。這更為網球界罕有的事。</p>
<p>自一九二七年起，法國網球界的慧星拉柯斯德與柯顯出現，鐵氏關始被這兩位選手擊敗。同時美國也就失去了台杯。那時候鐵氏的銳芒，似巳萎謝，照一般運動家的習例，鐵氏很可以就此放下屠刀，另讓賢能，可是他並不如此，而且愈加孜孜不倦地潛心研究，同時開始著述網球書籍，以惠後進。</p>
<p>一九二八年美法兩國台維斯杯選手，將在巴黎作却令治賽的前一月，鐵氏在倫敦參加惠勃爾登比賽，（那年鐵氏在半複賽中卽敗於柯顯）鐵氏撰述惠勃爾登比賽第一二週的經過，投寄於舊金山某報發表。美國草地網球協會，認為鐵氏撰述自已參加之比賽，有遠集餘運動規則，數度調查，毅然决然取消鐵氏的業餘資格。而鐵氏亦卽那年美國台杯隊隊長，協會方面竟不許鐵氏參加台杯决賽。當時轟動全球，成為網球界有史以來第一件大事。但是法國網球界，並不以台杯决賽的對手喪失主將，佔得穩得錦標的便宜，而引以為榮；反而堅决向美國網球協會抗議，認為鐵氏並非有意違犯業餘規則，應予以原諒。並說法國全國的網球觀衆，殊不願失去觀光世界最偉大綱球家的身手的機會。世界各國重視運動精神與業餘規則，有如此者。那年鐵氏雖得恢復資格，可是反給予鐵氏晉入職業網球界的一個信心。</p>
<p>鐵氏為要完成他　生最後的光榮，足為連進馴業綱球界的一個有力保陣，於是他加緊練習，終年不倦，果然，於一九三〇年完成他第三次惠勃爾登世界錦標後，乃正式宜佈加入職業網球界了。</p>
<p>他自加入職業界後，他的技術有進無退，而且遊行美國各地及其他各國比賽，十分勞苦，但是他興趣勃勃，不以為意。自一九三三年招致靑年網球家梵恩斯入伍後，他們二人一搭一擋，橫行世界，眞是天下無敵手。以前屢决擊敗鐵氏的法國錦標家柯顯，自人職業界後，反覺無聲無息，遠不若鐵梵二氏風頭之健。</p>
<p>鐵氏一身除努力球塲工作外，並努力於著作，生平着有網球書籍凡十餘種之多，並都有各國譯本，眞是紙貴一時。</p>

<p>新聲社云、雜糧業同業公會主席顧馨一氏、已與上海市商會主席王曉籟氏、商定國米流通國內、由市商會證明辦法、規定、凡上海雜糧同業自內地採辦米穀運滬、及由滬運米穀至各地、均向同業公會報告、經查明屬實、並無私運出國行爲後、再由公會請求上海市商會發給證明書、准予國內流通、上項證明書及申請表格、已由公會趕印、俟印竣後、即實施、至於前由社會局轉呈市政府、上海市國內流通暫行辦法、與上項證明辦法、並不抵觸、</p>
<p>米船待放　至於浙江平源嘉興嘉善三處扣留運滬米船、今平湖嘉善二處、業經該地米業團體、向縣政府請求、已具結放行、惟嘉興所扣米船、必須上海市商會證明後放行、今日運滬之米船、確無私運出國情形、故上海市商會、已允發給證明書、惟江蘇禁止糧食出境辦法、雖已通過、但未正式實行、對上海市認爲非境內、所以雜糧業公會、已請市社會局再向蘇省請求、對上海市應勿歧視、此後亦照浙江證明辦法辦理、</p>
<p>禁運出國　關於禁止糧食出國案、曾由上海市政府轉呈中央核辦、同時財政部曾邀集實業部中央信託局等會議、交關務署擬訂辦法、今關務署長鄭萊、已奉部令、擬具禁止糧食出國辦法、並詳查糧食運輸地點、以便作爲擬訂辦法之參考、據雜糧業領袖某氏談、關於禁止糧食出國、因事實上頗覺需要、所以勢在必行云、</p>
<p>滬米跌價　自浙江嘉善平湖等處、所扣之運滬米船放行後、江浙兩省各地運滬米船、絡續不絕抵滬、且上海存米、總約三十萬包、所以上海米價、業憶回跌、眞正頭號米已跌至十一元關、外傳上海運往大連暨東三省之米、日有二千包左右云云、據雜糧業消息、絕對不確、況該公會之會員米行、均已自動拒約外商之採辦云、</p>

<p>遠東方面現未遭罷工波及者、如傑克遜總統等輪、昨日大來洋行、已在協議爲維持中美航路及保護太平洋一綫交通計、已決定赴美各郵船、從今日起、改往坎拿大所屬維多利亞Victria海港停泊、作爲最終航埠、所有運美貨件、及赴美旅客、均在該埠起卸上陸、即由維多利亞轉火車至美國、藉以避開美國各海港碼頭也、</p>

<p>足疪議者　殊多、即如失竊（？）手槍、騰笑友邦、試問如公安局·巡捕房·本身發生盜刦情事、國人輿論、將如之何、刑法第一百三十條「公務員廢弛載務、釀成災害者、處三年以上十年以下有期徒刑」、然則法院而可失竊手槍、豈非廢弛職務、將此項新式手槍、散佈社會、又造成許多罪惡、豈非釀成災害、聞該駱通近將調任湖北高分院長、果爾、國家立法、豈專漢小民耶、民亦不願言、不忍言矣、自駱通長院以來、推檢之受賄被檢舉而辦罪者、有案可稽、姑勿論他、即就以發覺者而言、已心痛如割、總之、駱任</p>

<p>不准交保　裁決書、及報載等等、可以證明是否濫權羈押、現吳縣地院案已審結、案已明瞭、充其量不過罰金三十元、緩刑二年、本如此輕微案情、自六月八日下午二時半羈押、至八月二十二日上午十一時三刻交保出外、共計在押七十二天廿一小時一刻之久、試問非以情蔑法濫用職權羈押、尚屬何解、前院長駱通·及檢察官湯汝修·推事盧鴻澤、實觸犯刑法第一百二十五條第一項及第三項之罪、若不予嚴懲、效尤堪虞、查司法界之威嚴純正、應從本身做去、過去上海地院種種情形、信譽</p>

<p>紗市趨疲、因美棉漲度未熾、而三品紗市始漲復跌、人氣不振、但十一月期多方把持、始終不放、市價甚挺、但遠期因外廠口齒鬆動、且布疋交易已趨清澹、外路紗市呆滯、所以人心和平、逢漲時拋賣者尚不乏人也、</p>
<p>（本月期上海如故）標紗前市開盤、十一月期因美棉上漲、市氣堅昂、漲一元四角、但拍至遠期轉趨軟弱、因大戶多頭、乘漲時突來大量出檔、致檯面鬆懈、二盤以後、各月一致下挫、且大阪三品紗價回跌、現紗交易不旺、收盤雯屬平庸、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌五·六·九角、惟本朋漲七角、年後開盤、本月份續挺、因蜀幫採辦現紗、買氣又強、但遠期以大阪三品紗市不佳而挫、一盤以後、近期仍堅、遠月步步下降、但現紗交易未見大暢、成交一千二三百包、迨至收盤遠期跌風尤熾、結果本月比上午收盤價再漲九角、遠跌四·五·六·角、查賣出恒益一千三百五十包、泰興一千包、賡豐二千二百包、興昌一千七百五十包、愼記一千〇五十包、長豐六千六百包、潤康二千九百包、永大六百包、錦昌六百包、同和七百五十包、買進明德五千五百五十包、吉豐六百五十包、華懋一千五百包、豐泰一千六百五十包、仁豐一千五百包、協成二千六百包、振大九百五十包、長餘八百五十包、一日間行市比較於後、</p>

<p>昨日客秈到頭續有萬多包、因連日銷胃清淡、市形續見疲軟、晨間市氣甚萎、繼以客幫趁小問津、且天氣轉晴後、進戶亦稍活絡、廣幫前辦將次裝定、昨又暢辦各糙七千多包、河南幫亦復暢辦機晚靖、本街汕頭寗波均有問津、市面始得站定、惟市面疲軟已久、到存又多、雖客化活潑、然市價仍未上漲也、全日開江西米六千二百八址一包、湘米六千一百包、漢米三百包、甬台米二百四十六包云、</p>

<p>昨糖市趨勢平定、公會劃盤二四粗砂白現貨二十一元六角半、未成、轉口貨又小五分、爲六元零五分、東白惟八號現貨（Ｎ）嘜二十一地獄四角成交、餘均原價未動、本廠綿折金心一號二十元半、二號二十元三角、三號二十元一角、四號十九元九角、五號十九元七角、亦乏上落、號盤僅有潮幫開出、袋莊普通綿赤二百數十包、價爲十四元四角半至十四元半、潮青因號方成本均高、而產區新構防歉收、未此過賤、故擯持未開、</p>

<p>四川榨菜因產區天氣亢旱、迄今未能下種、勢必影響將來之收成、故立價突見盛漲、升度竟趨五元之多、此間聞訊、因亦大爲興奮、什牌樂磧菜開二十七元五角、涪陵菜開二十三元、統共成交四五百罐、貨底均稀、路貨上牌鴻利源樂磧菜呌二十八九元、行盤亦升四五元、樂磧菜售二十四元、涪陵菜二十元、</p>

<p>昨日海外絲市、因紐約大選揭曉、羅氏繼任總統、交易所市氣頗見振作、絲業亦隨之興奮、計近期騰漲五分、遠期漲三分、全日成交二千五百七十擔、橫濱絲市提升亦速、計現貨漲二十元、現貨漲十九元、本埠絲市亦復蘇醒、雖行盤未見起色、但三井等行購意頗濃、預料絲市當漸活躍、昨日本埠內外絲銷共售開二百六十五包、</p>

<p>— 德國Bruno　Fiank原著</p>
<p>我所知道的最　　的信，是　死的「伊凡·屠格湼夫」寫給「托爾斯泰」的。</p>
<p>這兒就是這封信：－</p>
<p>「布席法，六月廿七號或廿八號，一千八白八十三年。</p>
<p>親愛的和良善的李渥·尼可拉維奇！我長久沒有寫信給你，因為我會經一直，而事實上現在還是睡在我的等死的床上。講到恢復我的康健，——那已臺無希望，並且那也不値得再去想牠了。我實際上寫信給你只不過使你朋白，我會經是你的同時代人，是如何的驕傲，並向你作一個最後和懇切的請求。——我的朋友，再從事文學的工作！因為你的才能到你身上來，是從其他一切事物發源，你是知道的。如果我感覺確切我的請求會影響你，我當怎樣的欣慰呀！</p>
<p>我是一個「完結了」的人，——許多醫生甚至不晚得我的病呌什麼，——「神經痛的胃病的風症」。我旣不能走又不能吃，也不能睡，因此還有什麼事留下來可給我做呢？卽是講到這件事也够受了。我的朋友，露西亞國土的偉大作家——聽從我的請求。——」</p>
<p>這幾行信多麼沸揚着　望！生命的情調，在那樣狀態中，發出這樣的永別的致意，一切願望，又多麼値得珍視呀！雷南，（也是屠格涅夫所屬巴黎文字交團體的一員，）有一决形容過十九世紀是溫和而美麗的時期，有一個適合於藝術與科學發達的氣候，而這以後，一定會跟着而來一個粗暴的時期。呀，是的，粗暴的時期是如他所說的跟着來了。十九世紀，與古老文化永別的最後一個，對於那些被放逐而經歷水深火熱的人，，向之回顧，看起來似乎是一個和乎與智慧的天堂。</p>
<p>嚴格批評的文學欣賞者在他們的偉大死者的聖地中，不承認屠格湼夫的墳墓能占一席地位。他們不當他是一個天才，而僅當他是一個有才能的人。這是洞事實。他被露西亞深奧的天才，被道易斯托夫斯基所輕惡。眞有這會事，道易斯托夫斯基天出乎意料之外的去拜訪他，在道被驚擾的人的而前詛咒他犯了一個不名譽的事，並且宜佈使他　地位低於屠格湼夫這樣的人前面，乃是上天所能加於他身上的嚴重的惡　。屠格涅夫却很適合與與那一羣他在巴黎所遇見的著名作家——如佛勞貝爾，高　哀，　拉，襲古爾，泰納，雷南等在一起，這一切人都有同樣的靈魂和他相像，而所有人也都愛他。他們呌他溫柔的巨人（Le　doux　geant）他的性格的基調是人性，是建築在人類情感與對事實價疑的明辨的知識基礎上。看察一個人自已，也恰如其分。不滲入虛偽荒涎的夢想，而在生活的當中，堅持而不退縮，仁慈而不畏懼——這很　以把握着拿來當為一種鼓勵的理想對於一僻像我們所生存的這一時代，這一時代，牠的典型的人物，行止都極可鄙——這些人是愚笨的、貪污的，而同時沉醉於艷麗的辭藻當中。</p>
<p>比屠格涅夫的這封信少些艷麗，少些做作，他們就什麼都不成了。『我曾經一直而現在仍是睡在我的等死的床上』，那在他認為，巳經太過分了一點，太有力了一點，於是他加上動人的『事實上』一種煩擾的小辭，也是一種不得不告訴他自已在如此嚴重動人狀態下的抱歡語。他的病狀想起來一定是可怕的，皮膚的全部神經的表面都腫着，不斷地有着難受的痛苦。但沒有一個字講到痛苦！他開頭公開地描述他的情形，並對於醫生略加諷刺，但立卽撇說：『卽是講到這件事也够受了。』</p>
<p>他的意思是說：托爾斯泰也許感覺不快。在他的由於懷疑的知識而熟悉的人間隔膜，這種隔膜使個人與個人分開，他避免喚起另一個人一分鐘以上的反應的情感。但他也曉得每個人都要不快，如果他的同情與憐憫被人懹獲。因為他在這一句中个直接向托爾斯泰申訴，地省略代名　而一般地說。這省略的代宅詞在這德完美與莊嚴上，很可以超越目前歐洲一切公開所寫作一年的作品和所講述一年的說辭。</p>
<p>現在再稱到這位命定要死的人手中所寫的信誓　「我曾經是你的同時代的人，是如何的驕傲。」要多麼有可敬的謙恭，多麼有心底的誠敬，纔會有這樣一個一轉的文句！難道道不是表示而其義還　表示這將死的人回顧他的以往的一生，審閱一切所能給他的快樂，而找出最大的快樂是會經在讀「戰爭與和平」與「安娜凱林娜」麼？</p>
<p>即是　這位冷淡的和執拗八百七十七年。不久以　，托爾斯泰　生活　　　　，他背叛了自　生　來　嚴時　止　生活，　丟　，他　「　生的」女學絕　，完全致力於神學　研究，　譯「福音　」。無疑屠　湼夫　他的請求的方法　些崇高的狡點。一個將死內，，他這樣的告訴，很可能達到目的，而吸引托爾斯泰在意。但這件事對於他認為非常重要，因此他應用的　弱的　量訴述他的願望！『我當怎樣欣靈呀…。』他是一個無宗敎信仰者，他知道當黃土覆蓋他的屍體，一切對於他都將完了，但他　並不忽視常他離開世界後一切「　」將繁興下去選工昨。</p>
<p>他並不像後來那些變常可憎的時髦玩意兒在幹的一樣，沒有這樣舉動，當藝術，當詩自身，與生命比較，以為　不足重輕，類乎這樣的事件，　在對這位作應該引　羞恥的事。眞實　重要的工作應該在世界增加，　是</p>
<p>所關心的，這心　則不久將停止跳動，此外露西亞應該幫助這種珍寳的增加那就是這位世界主義　的愛國　忱。『我的朋友，露西亞國土的偉大作家！』</p>
<p>朋友去拜訪蘇格拉底於他　獄室，在　執行死刑的前夜，發現　在學習七絃琴的新繼。那位朋友驚呼道：『蘇格拉底，你　大就將敎行死刑，而你今天還一學習一首新歌？』對於這件事，蘇格拉底回答：『那未，我的朋友，什麼　他時間，你會讓我學習牠呢？』　這就是我們這封信的精神的精神。</p>
<p>但在宜告無望以後，屠格湼夫言請求道另一位作家照他以前一樣發揮他的大才，他附加一種理由，一種鼓勵　「因為你的才能你身上來，是從一切　　事物發源，你知道的。」那是件事有些不朽的。屠格湼夫寫了父與了，烟，貴族之家，及其他初　品，　露西亞　　農奴開　道　，但這一句無關緊要的話，可不應該忘　，　高翔於其他著　之上。我們　出這位病患者，當時是要使托爾斯泰明白負起不　常才能所應負起的責任，我們看出他是怎樣以一種宗敎的方式，授給這位可敬的後死者，我們覺到他是怎樣的　疑，他在勇敢地死和沒有宗敎信仰外，是怎樣為了可讀許的目的，不願少用偽　子的手段，而同時說出我們完全忽略的事件，　其結果產生這種精密與超拔的文句一轉。這位偉大的人物和作家大量地實容另一位作，他信仰，宗敎，或者至少熱切願望信仰宗敎，而他自己却永遠眞　，眞實像一個人，眞實像一個哲學家。</p>
<p>不，實在的，人性不是一句空話。不要被這動亂時代的招搖吸收，也不被那些狂暴者所吸收，也不要被跳舞病者（Stvitus　stancer）及那些無論持什麼信條約喧蠶的僧正所迷惑！走向眞實，走向簡單，有仁慈的心，保持樂觀，力持在憂愁和患難中的鎭靜，愛生命而不惡死亡，修養精神而不為外物所擾亂，－自從世界開始以來，沒有什麼更好的敎訓。（湘漁譯）</p>

<p>— 欽文</p>
<p>「文壇巨子，」「文學界權威，」魯迅先生去世以來，道種名稱幾乎天天都可以在雜誌報章上面看到。只是吶喊這冊書，其實只要阿Q正傳這一篇，至少在創作上，魯迅先生已在新舊文學之間割下了深刻的條痕。無論怎麼樣，在新文學界，總不能否認他是個先進；像他的强有力，也還很少有人可以相比的。不過他自己，並不打算以文學見稱；這只要一讀吶喊的自序就可以了然。吶喊的產生，在他原由於不得已。因為他知道「善於改變精神的是，我……以為當然要推文藝；」</p>
<p>在吶喊上他明明這種自序着。可是他也明白，為着改變一般人的精神，還有比文學更重要的事情。他從事於文學，有了盛大的收獲，聽說只要登上他的一篇短文，無論什麼雜誌，綃路一定可以增加好幾倍實在，許多靑年，都曾得着他的指導，受了他的影響的。</p>
<p>魯迅先生的文章會掛這樣動人，這樣受人歡迎，是因為他在做文章以外，還有着種種的努力；固然他能够抗暴扶弱，要為民族爭光榮，實在他是個勇敢的戰士，文學在他，可比是刀槍的一種工具罷了。魯迅先生，使得大家信仰的手段雖然時常轉變，站在時代前頭拼命奮鬥的精神却始終一致，對於文學的觀念，當然也在跟着潮流轉變。這也並不足怪，新的文學，固然要以實際的生活為基礎；魯迅先生，開始創作的吶喊，就是「間題的文學；」——為想改變愚弱的同胞的精神，在吶喊上自序得很評細。</p>
<p>已經寫了三十年的魯迅先生，如果「墨守」售觀，那就不但無所謂「巨子」「權威，」魯迅」這一項職業了。</p>
<p>從事文學，平常可以分作四項着手，就是提倡，創作，批評和介紹。魯迅先生，提倡在三十年以前，創作了吶喊等等的世界名著，批評在雜感中到處可以看到，介紹，他的翻譯也是够多的了，更可注意的是關於被損害的弱小民族的文學。那末他長四項齊全的了，而且都很出色。但這也不必以為奇怪，他已有了久長的塗史，並非一下子就做到的。</p>

<h3 id="c205">自然主義劇的創始者問題 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 侯楓</p>
<p>關於法國的自然主義劇一般人總以為是起始於亨利·彭慈區的，然而，實際上最初建立自然主義的理論，再為實行這理論而奮鬥的，乃是耶來魯·左拉。因為彭慈區的自然主義的劇本「烏鴉」最初上演於法國的ComedieFrancaise劇塲，是一八八二年的事；　左拉在“Bien　Public　”＂Voltaoje”等報上發表其自然主劇的理論，引起了當時劇壇上熱烈的論爭，却是在一八七六－七七年間。至於他最初的自然　義的劇本“Therese上演，則是一八七三年的事呢。故所以，關於自然主義劇的名稱，建立自然主義劇的理論，實踐的和各方面鬥爭，左拉要比彭慈區先九年。</p>
<p>為了自然主義劇理論的提出及其實踐的運動，使左拉成為當時法國文壇上的衆矢之的，反對派對他的造謠中傷，可以說是無所不至，而蒙受到各劇塲對他的劇本成立「非買同盟」的打擊，可是，左拉却並不因此而灰心，退却，什麼呌做「卑　」的惡意的批難，實在是不能抹煞我們這位自然主義的創始者那種基於時代精神的理論劇之實際的存在，反而設明了他的現實的力量之宏大·所以他的Therese　Raquin”也就獲得了「一鳴驚人」的效果</p>
<p>關於自然主義劇的生長之跡，我們可以在左拉的理論和作品中尋求之。從他那原是小說，後來復寫成劇本的The＇rese　Ruquin＂開始，就忠實地實踐其理論，無論是　式或內容，都是以自然　義為出發點，一直到後來的Renee”（五幕劇，一八八七年四月十六日初演）等，都很明確地表現了自然主義劇的孕育，生長，長成的過程呢。至於彭慈區在後來所發表的劇本之被稱為寫賓主義的模範，乃是受了那種機運的刺戟。</p>
<p>在安多窪奴自由劇塲所捲起的現實主義劇運動，全然是左拉的理論的開展。而從十九世紀末到第一次世界大戰前後間的那些有名的寫實主義的劇作家，直接或間接的都是受了左拉的戲劇理論的敗發。一直到現在左拉的戲劇理諭，還是成為劇界的一主流。這當然不是毫無理由的。總之，左拉不僅是一個自然主義劇的指導者，同時也是自然主義劇的創始者呢。</p>

<p>因為海外一位朋友要我轉給魯迅先生一封信，我才與他有一面之緣。信原是很普通的，我可以交到內山書店轉給他便完了。不過朋友的可囑要我面交，並有事要我同他面談，因此，不得不去找他見面。</p>
<p>那天我浴着溫和的日光走到內山書店，說明了來意，內山先生要我等一等，他代我通知。我坐着等了一時，不料來的却是一位女士，經內山先生的說明，我才知道她是魯迅先生派來的。</p>
<p>「我是周先生的學生」，她自己先介紹了「周先生不在家，有什麼事，我們不妨先談談。」她很溫和的說。</p>
<p>「這是×君的一封信，你可以看看。」我從衣袋中拿出一封信，一面遞給那位女士，一面這樣說。　她看了後，知道君囑咐有事要我們面談，信也須面交，她依舊將信交還了我。並代的定了第二日的見面的時間和地點。　次日我到內山書店，魯迅先生已經來了，他當門斜坐着，面色很灰暗蒼老，衣服不大敎潔，兩眼却很有力的看視我。當然也是經內山先生說明一下，我們便開始談話。</p>
<p>我把×君的信遞給他。</p>
<p>「昨天同你見面的那位，是我的老婆，她告訴你，她是我的學生吧？」他一面看信，一面微笑着申明似的說。</p>
<p>「呵呵，」我只這樣應了一下。「那就是你們兩地書上的廣平女士吧？一想這樣說一句，但只笑着未說出口。他旋卽站了起來。</p>
<p>「我們到前邊咖啡館里細談談好吧？」他看着我，我只點了下頭，便同他走出內山書店。</p>
<p>我們走到距內山書店約有半里許的一家小咖啡館中。坐定後，他念着信在繼續着看。看完了信，很愉快的向我說：</p>
<p>「你看我的身體怎樣呢？他們總是担心我的身體。其實他們在國外過久了，見慣了碩大的西洋人，自然覺得我的身體瘦弱了。究竟我並沒有什麼病，看來似乎不結實，實則也還好，我天天都在勞働呀。」他拖着雜有些紹興土音不純熟的普通話在幽幽的說。</p>
<p>「我倒盼望你能如朋友們約期望，到國外去休養一時。」我不加考慮的這樣回答他。實則我眞有點可憐這位老戰士，他身體是那樣不行，環境又極慘酷的壓迫他。這樣內外交攻，他怎樣支持呢？「並且×君恐怕你在經濟上有困難，他另外託了朋友代你籌借，到了那裏才歸還，而且這位朋友巳慨諾了」。我繼續着說。——道是朋友要我常面說穿，怕他為經濟而煩惱。可是他的身體好不好，我却沒有回答他。因為我看他對自已的身體相信頗强，實則他的身體又那樣不行，我怎好置答呢。順便我還告訴他，海外的朋友們聽到許多不利於他的謠言。大家都放心不下，因此更是希望他到國外去住一時。</p>
<p>他笑了笑，吸着紙烟，慢吞吞的說：</p>
<p>「謠言呢，道是一年到顛都有的，怎能顯得了那許多，到國外去住一時，自然是好，而且也曾經這樣打算過。但若果是為謠言嚇走的，那倒不必。因為在國外也是不能久住呀，回來還不是要到中國來，那時謠言或渚更多了。」他說了這些話，跟着突然問我認不認識××先生。我告訴他在十年前便認識，並且還是我在××大學的敎員。</p>
<p>他聽到我認識徐先生。因此他告訴我許多關於徐先生的消息，從徐先生的近年生活，和他死的經過。以及他自死後還有許多關於他的謠言。並且告訴我他正在為他蒐集各種遺作。預備要半年的工夫，將徐先生的遺著編成功。並整理好自己的一切東西，然後才談到出國的事。現在不能卽時出國，這也是重要的原因。</p>
<p>「他的遺作實在是可寳實的，牠將給予人類很大的貢獻，我為他編輯遺著，到不僅是為朋友的私情。」最後他微帶一點傷感的聲調這樣說。</p>
<p>我靜默了一時，問他是否預備寫復信與×君，他略一思素，說：「不必了，請你代我告訴他們吧。」</p>
<p>最後，我們約定了通信和見面的所在。因為我會經要求他將來在文字上·或有請求他的地方。</p>
<p>我們相偕走出咖啡館，彼此輕輕的點了下頭，便背道走開了。我走了的有五碼遠近，回頭來看他，他正慢慢的斜披着陽光向西北角上走去。</p>
<p>分別後，未會有第二次見面的機會。後來在報紙上，發現這位老戰士死的消息，給予我一下嚴重的刺激！半天我都透不過氣來。這幾天來，我只是在報紙上找羣關於他死後的消息。畢竟我們這位為民族解放鬥爭的老戰士的精神已分佈給廣大羣衆！連日來成千成萬的工人學生及店員都爭着去瞻仰我們已死的老戰士的遺容，這不是說明，他的未了的事業，已有這些後死者繼承了嗎？</p>

<p>「眞討厭，糖師傳又來了，上趟小弟弟吃了他的糖菩薩，泄肚子好幾天：他又來了！</p>
<p>我同靜宜從黃包車上跳下來，就看見弄堂口上有許多小朋友圍著一個糖祖子。糖師傅正在口吹成一變糖老鼠，用手揑成耳朶尾巴。靜宜從小朋友淘里找出我們的小弟弟，不免有些不耐煩了。</p>
<p>「你莫看輕糖師傳，他雖然在街頭上討生活，却是一個藝術大師呢」。</p>
<p>靜宜聽了我的話，不覺笑了起來。她說道：「那裏這許多藝術大師」</p>
<p>我想，街頭上的藝術大師還很多，如在牆壁上描烏龜的書家，賣胡琴笛子的音樂家，玩木人頭的戲劇家，唱蓮花落的天才詩人，告地狀的自叙傳或懺悔錄的文壞宿將，以及揑灰麵人物或做泥人的彫塑巨子，賣解變戲法的國術博士，轉西洋鏡的大導演　，都是。他們雖然不曾公然以藝術大師自居，可是我們要這樣稱呼他們，不算過分恭維罷。</p>
<p>我看那個糖祖子上的一隻草簇，揷著許多藝術品，任人展覽，不收門票。那都是想要出淸的存貨，沒有自高身價的非賣品。不過草簇上似乎分了兩個不可雜亂的階層，下層是猴子，猫，鼠，鷄，狗，魚，蝦，蒐子，以及靜物喇叭，水烟袋等等；上層就是人形，從捧大刀的關公直到佩指揮刀的大將都有，好像象微著古今敢戰的英雄，難道「國防」的口號也影響到了這位藝術大師？可不知道他們之間也為了「國防」「民族」兩個口號起過論戰沒有？然而我所注意的不在這里，只眼睜睜的望着那幾個戴盔甲，有武器的糖製的英雄出神。雖說是糖製的英雄，未必能够禦侮打仗，却也威武不可侵犯，儼然鎭壓着在他下層的一羣可憐的動物。</p>
<p>「爸爸，媽媽等你回去吃晚飯呢。」</p>
<p>我聽到小弟弟呌我的聲音，纔離開了糖担子。但我從這發個糖製的英雄想到「戴帽餳」－歷史上的一個故事。原來揑製糖人的藝術，算是「古已有之」的了。</p>
<p>隋朝有一個清官，呌做梁彥光的，丟官以後，在家閒居。有一天，皇帝找他問話，呌他去做趙州刺史。他說：「趙州我不去，要去就去相州。」皇帝道：「相州你不是去過的麼？」他說：「上次我做相州刺史，我不願意擾動百姓，所以不肯多做，以為一動不如一靜。不料那里的人，笑我糊塗，欺我儒弱，把我比做糖做的官兒，以為好看不中用，給我一個『戴帽餳』的混號。因此我就丟官了。我想我這一生沒有再出來的日子，不料皇上天恩，又給我去做趙州刺史。那麼，我還是想回到相州，做點事情，一雪前恥。」皇帝就准許了他。這次他到相州，居然成了一個頂能幹的官兒了。隋書里面寫進了這個故事，不知可靠麼？</p>
<p>「戴帽餳，」「糖製英雄，」也儼然像人，引起人也像牠的妙想，糖師傳不愧為藝術大師了。</p>

<p>吾輩醫師，雖以臨床診療爲職守，然書本之研索，化騐室之探究，皆屬迫切需要。故化學實騐室之於醫師，亦猶醫院病牀，爲醫師所切身需要者。</p>
<p>今日化學實騐室中，忽有一光彩炫目之「奇蹟」映入吾人眼簾，爲全球淋病學家所同聲讚揚！蓋此事關於學術上之有價值貢獻，固不僅爲單純之淋病治療上已有特效方法也。</p>
<p>夫此種最新貢獻，乃用斜面培養基之試騐管，取淋病患者體內或尿濁中淋菌，作「純培養」。於是此項手續，遂幻爲奇觀。此時將培養基全體，塗擦培養後，乃將其投入二〇米突之食鹽水試騐管中，暫時放置，則見菌培養在食鹽水內浮游，全部培養基面之淋菌均剝離浮游而呈極度活動，如以類脂肪汁盛入試騐管內，而取另一新鮮培養基置入此試騐管中，則自二時內或三日間，培養基上之淋菌必完全死滅，殲除凈盡。此實曠古未有之異聞，而淋病治療，乃獲在紛亂無主見之岐途中搜出一重要線索！</p>
<p>查類脂肪汁即動植物體內之一種蛋白體，其殺滅淋菌並非以猛毒之力量肆行誅伐，蓋溫文有效按步就班之滅菌作用，實爲蛋白體之特性。根據此理，此蛋白體配製清尿消炎之黃色素而作成內服劑，即成爲今日風行各著名醫院及醫師臨症上之克淋特效藥「克淋儂」！其治男性淋毒睾丸腫硬，攝護腺精囊炎之遺精夾血，及急性淋尿道刺痛等各種淋病，效力神速！而婦女白帶之由丈夫淋病傳染者，則因子宮粘膜糜爛，陰道炎腫，尤須服「克淋儂」以清除體內及陰部淋菌，則易於根治。且一方須外用「卡而雪地」氏陰道片，滌除白帶，迅速根本全愈。</p>
<p>因有此等特點，故「克淋儂」之治淋已爲一般稱善矣！</p>

<p>……怎樣重新燃起你的生命的火熖？　……再享受人生有意義的幸福生活？</p>
<p>『拖下整個生命的手淫！』</p>
<p>人生發育的基本，在於性腺——青春腺的健全。而所泌出的精華就是精液。無奈因爲在青春發育期手淫Masturbation所傷；手淫一次，就是把生命線砍了一斧；結果，整個的生命都這手淫拖去了。我們時常遇到庸懦易躁，富於激怒，作事易倦，注意力薄弱，頭痛不適，面色枯萎憔悴的青年，不用說，他早已中了手淫的惡魔了。而患者自己所最感到痛苦的，就是性器官的渺小，遺精，滑精的襲來。這，都是性神經衰弱的症象，也是勃起力不能的先聲。假使病態發展到這程序，那他的儀容，更加頽唐，雙目無光，外面罩上暗黑色之環，四肢冰冷，步履蹣跚。這是一副由手浮釀成的逼肖的寫眞。</p>
<p>我們應該怎樣燃起將逝的生命火熖，而享受人生有意義的兩性的幸福？那末據英倫Gainsborough博士說，應當立刻停止手淫；同時應進服大量的荷爾蒙製劑；據我從日本帝國大學醫科畢業歸國後所醫治的經騐，以服「補體康」一藥，最有卓效，因「補體康」係用勇壯動物之荷爾蒙所製成；能根治手淫而來的各項症象：遺精早洩，發育不全，久婚絕孕，及一切神經衰弱如頭痛失眠心悸健忘等，均可服「補體康」，以掃除之。因服後荷爾蒙增加，除促增新陳代謝機能旺盛性器官發育外，又能充實肌肉，改換頽唐的面容而爲細膩白皙的光潤面龐，以多數例子中所指示，服「補體康」而獲效者，在百分之九十三四以上。有遺精病的可兼服「耐而斯遺精片」以固精關，更爲四面顧到的治法。</p>

<p>黃屏建君，年三十四，金業。（病原）——先天本極虧弱，又因早婚之害，　喪荷爾蒙機能，致發育不全。（症狀）——體格短小，性器細如食指。背部變曲，精神萎頽，言諧有氣無力，夫職有虧，甫卸即洩。夜間睡難安枕。夢多，記憶力減退，神志昏懵，迭服製劑，毫無寸功。乃由友人莫守默君介紹，來余處治療。（診療）——經用科學方法檢查，診知非但生殖部分萎弱，且全身荷爾蒙缺乏，乃用電氣療法。並主用「補體康」補充荷爾蒙，約四星期，生機大振，正氣滂礴，精神愉快云，</p>
<p>遺精滑漏……身體虧憊</p>
<p>文雲振君，年十八，學界。（病原）——因年少無知，受劣友引誘，冒犯手淫，遂成惡癖。（症狀）——遺精頻頻，夢多心悸，神疲身弱，作事無力，讀書不易記憶，致學業大退。而一星期輒有五次或每日一次之遺精，大小便後，甚至亦有精液流出，經友人介紹，就治於余。（診療）——余囑其行冷水浴，並令往永安公司西藥部購服「耐而斯遺精片」根治遺精，並服「補體康」補救衰弱之神經，未月許即獲全治云</p>

<p>神經衰弱爲感情決裂之原因。　欲過甜美兩性生活之借鑑</p>
<p>女子以嫻靜溫婉爲最好的性格，大多女子都具有這種性格的。不過如因早婚或手淫，及生產太多的女子，性腺受到重大的打擊，以致氣血兩虛，神經亦受到刺戟而漸衰老。往往呈處性之興奮。多愁易怒，（俗謂肝火上升）往往一種不必要的小事，也視爲莫大之事，而疑慮日漸滋生，這種女子，她的月經必乖亂不調的，身是貧血的，而頭痛腰酸，背冷腳弱，耳鳴眼花。胃呆食減，性情冷酷，或暴烈異常，這都是性腺受傷，卵巢失云完整的機構。此外就是白帶奔流，下部糜爛。</p>
<p>我自從南通醫科大學畢業後，開業以來，凡患有此病者，即投以「補女容」，以補血調經，強腦壯體，使脆弱之神經，重趨健全。恢復嫻靜溫婉之性情，使兩性不致因性之不合，而決裂離婚，且不孕者可重姙，體虛者可以復原，實爲女性病最合理的治療，至駐顔美容，猶其餘事。惟患有白帶者，除一方仍服「補女容」外，同時宜用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」爲坐藥。</p>

<p>戒煙之最效法</p>
<p>中央社四日北平電：平市當局定明年一月一日槍決大批癮君子。故已在南城定製薄皮棺木數千口，承製木廠，因其距槍決煙犯期祗五十餘日，故日夜加工趕製甚忙。云云。</p>
<p>煙客的末路到了——這已成爲事實。吸煙的人忽戒忽吸，若再不具有決心，那眞是自暴自棄。然而戒煙時的痛苦，也實是促成煙民重吸的原因！</p>

<p>患者金得勛君，罹淋病迄已三載；少腹膨滿，時起疝痛，會陰及肛門皆有不快之感；尿意頻數，疑其已成精囊炎，乃將其漓出精液（分泌液）用顯微鏡檢查之，見精液呈灰黃色及灰赤色，雜有膿血，精蟲亦多死亡。（如第一圖），故多年未能生育，遂確證其爲精囊炎，乃投以「克淋儂」內服藥，以抗淋殺菌消炎鎭痛，連服月餘，即告全瘳。仍將其泌出之精液用鏡檢查之，已呈灰白色之透明狀，時有西米之澱粉狀小塊，精蟲活潑，（如第二圖）。（按圖中有形如蝌蚪狀者，即吾人精蟲，）恢復正常之精液，此爲「克淋儂」治愈精囊炎之證。此症如不治愈，即難生育。「克淋儂」一藥，不僅對於精囊炎有效，即凡是急慢性淋各種續發症，倂發症，皆有特殊效果，故能暢行全球爲淋濁之救星也。</p>

<p>— 陳少華醫師</p>
<p>白帶病，一般女子皆以其隱病而忽之。故延宕失治，局部因污液之侵淫，將陰道桿菌殺滅，致外界細菌，乘機而入，由陰道而子宮以直入卵巢，因而誘發種種不可測之症狀。最著之惡果，厥爲引起月經困難，子宮出血，身體孱弱，因而受姙力喪散，在臨床之統計上，許多不姙之原因，以白帶爲占多數。因引白帶最能毒殺精子，破壞卵巢機能之健全故也。</p>
<p>在吾人經騐上所得，其原因有不潔性交而來者，有用精暴之房事，擦破粘膜而來者。有因身體虛弱而來者。故施治之法，以外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」爲坐藥，以防腐消炎止泌鎭痛。其因淋毒而來者，可兼服「克淋儂」，以掃除內部淋毒。若因身體虛弱，月經不調而來者，可兼服「補女容」，以強體調經。如此則白帶可以根除，則受孕力即可恢復矣。此種療法，每個患者，皆可在家行使，毫無流弊。</p>

<p>毀滅生殖之淋病</p>
<p>淋病本屬一種不潔之性行爲所造成。病灶亦在生殖器部分。所以最容易釀成不孕之主因。但因患者，對於淋病毫無常識，所以多放任，或雖延醫服藥，而又苦於無鑑別力，祗能盲目的摸索著醫治，結果淋病十九未能治愈，反而增加病毒之深化與延長。又不能保持長時間之禁慾，及其他之必須之攝生，所以生殖系之組織，恒爲淋菌所破壞，而不育之惡果，遂在此等塲所結成。思之毛髪爲悚然。最易毀滅生殖機能之淋病，厥爲攝護腺炎，睾丸炎，輸精管炎，精囊炎等。因此等性器官握生殖上最大之職務。然而不幸淋病患者又十九續發成倂發此等病狀。不過在病毒未深，組織未完全毀滅之時，施以適當治療，則未嘗無根治之效，而重復健全之性的生殖機能。</p>
<p>余因多年之經騐。覺治療此等淋病，非具有抗淋素之內服藥不可。而一方更輔以電療及抗淋血清等，更爲妥貼，有居山東路之郁廷烈君。因染淋毒後，不知作適當之醫治，致成睾丸炎與攝護腺炎之倂發症。睾丸腫墜作痛，小便艱苦不暢，會陰肛門痛楚。患後又不愼於房事，致染其夫人。成烈性之白帶。婚後亦並未有育。雖終年不廢醫藥而厥病反深。嗣讀余之「性病全書」。丐余治療，經檢查結果，知郁君之攝護腺將欲成漏，睾丸亦有硬化趨勢。此爲性器官將毀壞之明證，乃囑往中西大藥房購服「克淋儂」，以增多抗淋素而消炎鎭痛防腐利尿。同時更用電療及抗淋血清，計五星期而愈。又用「補體康」以治已傷之性腺。其夫人淋病，亦經余指用「克淋儂」爲內服劑，外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，亦在短期治愈。舊臘已舉一子，足證生殖力已恢復矣，</p>

<p>……把手淫當作娛樂的也有……笑話　……視遺精爲常事的尤其多……奇談</p>
<p>不論是年老或正年青的讀者，我相信你們必然都有著或是犯過一種秘密。老實點說罷：人們在青看期，誰都會染犯手淫的癖好，不過次數有的多或是少一點罷了。日本長濱繁博士說：男子在青年期犯手淫的，佔百分之九十。無疑地，隨手淫而來的症候就是遺精和腎虧了。</p>
<p>但是有很多沒有醫學常識的人，視手淫遺精爲一種娛樂，那眞是數典忘祖，太不知人事！</p>
<p>至於遺精症的治療，應該內外兼治。而精神的攝養，尤關重要。像溫泉的沐浴，冷水的灌洗陰部，日光的照射，室內空氣充足，衣被宜稍薄軟等等，都非常重要。</p>
<p>此外，遺精患者因精液不斷地耗損，致荷爾蒙缺乏，而性力萎頽，精液滑漏等症，均紛呈雜出。據博士之研究，遺精應以內服「耐而斯氏遺精片」爲最要。蓋此藥能歛攝輸精管，鎭攝性神經，則慾火自低，手淫可除，而遺精自獲治愈也。「耐而斯遺精片」之治遺精，功效特強，非其他製劑所能比並，凡精滑等遺，及因房事過度而來遺萎弱均宜進服此藥，即可在短期內全部根治焉。如遺精過久，身體衰弱，腦弱失眠，腎萎等症，則應同時內服「補體康」爲佳！</p>

<h3 id="c220">日方準備談判技術 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>據近日電傳，中日交涉難關，如何打開，雖為各方注目，但現信尙在開會接洽時期，像一般人觀察，日方現正約集多數要貝，會商進行交涉之技術云云。我輩非外交家，天然懂不得所謂外交技術，更談不到外交技術的方式若何，不過我們所知道的，自川越大使到京，興我國當局作調整中日關係談判後，只見一度談判，因意見未能一致，而桑島來華携有日方之新訓令矣，又見再度談判，意見仍不一致，於是須磨返國，又携所謂新訓令而來矣，但是他們兩次的新訓令是怎樣？他們談判的情形是怎樣？他們談判到若何程度，又是怎樣？我們尙跌在十里霧中，血莫名其三官廟也。</p>
<p>惟知日方的外交方針，原有兩種辦法，一曰雙重外交，一日外交一元化，所謂雙重外交，和外交一元化者，無非軟硬兼施，剛柔並進之謂，卽以俗語言之，就是一個拳頭，一個糖塊，恩威並用而已，試觀現在日方的外交情形，眞是奇怪，一方面使川越駐京，與我國當局作「商量式」之談判，而另一方面，北方傳來，天天有驚人的消息，一說暴徒乘日軍大操，企圖搗亂，故天津特別戒嚴，又息，日方在平律一帶大操一星期，大批日兵，穿行平市，又息，日方在平津一帶，任意派警，設立崗位，又息，某方積極西侵，綏遠岌岌可危云云，此次中日的交涉，究屬欲用和平談判方式進行呢？還是要用不和平的妄動方式進行？假定欲用和平談判方式進行，則雙方正在談判而未曾到决裂時期，在平津方面，不應有此任意妄行的舉動，假定欲不和平的妄動方式進行，則雙方用不着再作商量式之談判，這種普通的常識，任何外交家與非外交家，多能彀明白這一點。</p>
<p>所以我們的外交，專靠商量式的談判，還嫌不彀，也應該像日本用雙重外交，因為他們用雙重外交手段，我們也應該用雙方外交手段，方為正辦，否則外交談判，一天一天的敷衍下去，而華北局勢，一天一天的緊張，到了結果，還要說聲是旣成的事實，我們任何拒絕，否認，多是飯後鐘，已來不及，這樣情形，是否是外交技術的一種最好辦法，又前日某日本通訊社稱，一般人對於中日交涉的延宕，頗為憤懣云云，這種說法，是否反話，也未可知，但看現在的情形，延宕也可說是外交技術的一種，所以這一點，務要請當局者嚴重注意，不可忽視。</p>
<h3 id="c221">偷版與查禁 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 黎學濂</p>
<p>據報載，一日北平專電；冀察當局認為『郭沬若文集中有涉及古賢孟軻離婚問題，與孔夫子吃飯問題；均有侮慢之處，政委會頃令所屬各機關查禁該書、在市間銷售，以後凡有侮孔孟書籍均一律禁止售賣。』過兩天，申報也載了一則「書業敗類翻印魯迅遺著」的消息。這兩則電訊不期而碰在一起，無疑的是頗値得吾人注目的。魯迅和郭沫若先生都是最為大衆所景仰的文壇巨匠，而今居然有一人的著作被「禁」，一人的著作被「偷」（偷版）。在關心文化事業的我們看來，不能不油然而生了若干憤慨。</p>
<p>郭沫若先生的文集，我們在坊間沒有看過，我疑心也是近乎偷版的。郭先生近年亡命海外，被「偷」「剝」的著作，就不知有過多少，這在郭氏的文章和談話中，有時也可聽到。倘使眞的是被偷版，則冀察當局之「禁」，在著作人的利益上說，也未嘗沒有好處的。至少也可以使「書業敗類，」遇到一個打擊！可情的是，冀察當局的「禁，」並不是為了維護文化，而是因為他有「侮慢」「孔孟之處」，乃通令禁售。自然，在復古氣燄正在高漲的現在，把「侮慢」孔孟認為有罪，正是意中的事。不過，目前的華北形勢正是這麼緊張，而當局不去管較為嚴重的國家大事，徧徧在計較「孟軻離婚」和「孔夫子吃飯」問題，似乎頗有點不大合適。何况郭氏的文章，並不是憑揑造，而是有古籍為之根據的。從這次禁售看來，不特使入覺得目前無謂言論自由，且冀察當局頗有點「好管閑事」之慨！</p>
<p>郭氏的文章，據我們所知，是兩篇歷史小品；近來寫歷史小品的人很多，魯迅先生也是其一。倘郭氏文集被「禁」，則魯氏之「故事新編」，我想無疑的也會遭到這命運的。可巧的是，魯迅的文集未被查禁前；卽已橫遭「書業敗類」偷版了。「侮慢古賢」，其實不止郭氏如此，魯氏也是大同小異的。假如當局「愛古人遠甚於今入，」則魯迅之死，可謂得其所矣。－然而，在我們却是不勝其哀痛的。</p>

<p>現在，從車站里載了客出來的車子，拉過了橋，來到子東堤了。</p>
<p>東堤，這是個在這都市里有着粉紅色的歷史的地方，一般下賤的廉價的艇妓的聚集地。而今，這一切眞的成了歷史了，那里，方上燈，打扮得有點怕人的白和紅的混塗着的臉龐，哭喪地已在掙扎着吆喚客人。</p>
<p>「時衰運衰，行路也打倒退！唉－－」一個年紀方二十五六的女人，已在那裏埋怨着命運，和那殘酷的時間把她催老了。抑鬰的嘆息打酸了那站在她的旁邊的方出籠的「小嫩鷄」。（註一）</p>

<p>「搬，不是這容易啦！阿媽還會在我身上下本錢嗎？新塡地里像我這付年紀，眞的站也站不住啊！……」</p>
<p>她們瞪着凝滯的眼珠子，貪饒的溜着那從車站拉來的滿載的客人，一點也不給她們的鷄呌樣的吆喚打動似的，她們妬忌地又注目地送這些車子，一大連串的向西拉，拉向新塡地，西堤，黃沙，去了。</p>
<p>這一段十里長堤，海珠鐵橋做成了一條很顯明的界綫，橋以西的那熱鬧的夜市，正給那襄老了的東堤以很毒辣的諷刺。這邊的夜市，也是兩個世界，靠北這一邊是大的建築物，除了先施公司和大新公司兩座崇高的大洋房外，一切熱鬧的酒館，電影院，粵戲塲，種種式式都齊備。電燈和霓虹燈是猛烈得傷害了人們底眼睛。人？無論穿筆挺西裝的紳士，和在取締之列的淑女，（註二）以及中等以上的人，都擠成了一長列，魚串般從不間斷。這時候，已是夜的活躍的時候了。</p>
<p>靠海這一面，那又是另一個夜世界。</p>
<p>計劃了不少時日的塡堤，已是完功了七八分。大洋房也建了不少，但却像一定要餘下了多少空地來闢設這一個夜世界似的，使這一塊給喚做新塡地的地方，好容納九敎三流的聚集。</p>

<p>——舊史新編——　　六月的太陽，高高地掛在天空，光芒彷彿烈火一般地，照逼着田野，河上……連整個的大地，簡直像燃燒着了的鐵鍋一樣。</p>
<p>天公在十朝之前下過一塲小雨，直到現在，却再不見降落一點來。天色靑朗地，四周毫無一片的雲朶。</p>
<p>田裏的稻禾，全晒得變成了枯萎，河道里的水也快要乾涸了。小池塘早向了天，沿四邊貼着許多乾燥的死魚和死蝦，在太陽光下發若陣陣的腥臭。…………</p>
<p>三江口的漁船，現在一條條約擱住在淺岸上，打漁的人沒有魚可打，都把工作停頓了下來。</p>
<p>「這殺人的年頭呵　再要不下雨，讓兇惡的旱天壓到人間來，乖乖！那我們一般窮苦人，大家可不得了啊！……</p>
<p>漁民們指天劃地，在涕淚交流之下喧嚷着。連六十多歲的蕭恩老頭子，也不住的望着明朗的靑天，吼吼的呌苦</p>
<p>眼霎霎的沒有雨水以來已是半個足月了。</p>
<p>可是在這半月中，捕漁人們的漁稅，丁府上並未因為天旱而放鬆了他們。連朝派了鄔民這老奴，和着三四個壯漢，趕到河邊來催索。</p>
<p>「……你們這批狗種！你們誰敢不付漁稅？難道丁府上的規例有人敢大膽述抗嗎？……誰領首！嘿，該死的傢伙！……</p>
<p>姓鄔的老奴，仗着丁府的勢利，到處板着鐵靑的臉皮，鋻起幾根稀疏的鬍髭，眼睛瞪得酒杯那麼大，帶怒帶罵的咕嚕到蕭恩的船邊來了。</p>
<p>簫恩正悶坐在船上，這時，立起身來，指着乾涸的河道向他說：</p>
<p>「爺爺　請你也來瞧瞧！這樣的河道……呌我們打漁人那兒去找活啊！……小的魚死盡了，大的早游向大江裏去了。漁稅，我們並非遠抗丁府上的規例，實在……實在我們是無法可想！………」</p>
<p>「無法可想？你蕭老頭也設的嗎？」鄔老奴回頭來瞧着蕭恩，眼睛浴着血「爺爺！事實擺在眼前，並非我姓蕭的一人這樣主張。……這回煩你回府通禀你家太爺，待我們來年付稅。來年年歲好些，我們多多的加利，那好了！……」蕭恩精神很是矍　，堆着滿臉的笑臉迎上去，從他兩爿白鬚下乾癟的嘴唇里滾出了一大套說話，向鄔老奴苦苦的哀懇。</p>
<p>「胚！斗膽的傢伙！……別多嚕囌，先帶你這老狗才回丁府去聽候發落……」</p>
<p>說着：鄔老奴躥上前來一把扭住蕭恩，隨卽後面的幾個漢子也一齊擁了上來。</p>
<p>可是蕭恩眞的惱怒了。他鎭定着，揮起二個有力的大拳抵抗着。</p>
<p>喧喊聲鬧得像坍了墻集。然而不經他一人上手，大漢們就像葱蒜似的一個個應聲倒下地來，鄔老奴被他蹂在脚下</p>
<p>蕭女兒冠英在船艙後，聽得岸上聲音，急忙爬出艙來，上岸阻住了她爹的拳足，一手把脚底的鄔老奴拖了起來。可是被摔倒的幾個漢子這時却變得呆怔着，呼呼的不息地牛喘。……</p>
<p>「反了！蕭老狗才反了！……好，回去告訴太爺，明天來抓你到公堂處分……」</p>
<p>鄔老奴捧着自己的頭顱，邊說邊招呼着那羣鬥敗的蟋蟀似的漢子，一齊向龜裂的田野里沒命的躥跑了去。</p>
<p>蕭恩拭着衣襟上的塵埃，望着他們一夥人的後影，發了一陣淡漠的嘲笑。……</p>
<p>第二天，中午辰光，太陽依舊高掛在天空，一如昨日。沿三江口那條乾涸的河道上的漁民一齊聞訊而來聚集了。</p>
<p>他們個個像忘了是熱天，赤身曝露在烈陽下，聽着蕭恩站在船頭上高聲地說：</p>
<p>「呃！我們不要再付給漁稅了！誰付，誰就是我們大衆的叛徒！……」精神豪爽地一邊說着，一邊把右手握緊的大拳子舉起來，裝着滿腔餘怒未息的神態</p>
<p>「肅叔叔的說話對啦！」</p>
<p>「……不錯！我們都得照此而行啊！」</p>
<p>漁民們也都握着一個個拳頭，把烏黑的被陽光曝晒得像樹皮色的臂膊舉了起來，表示十分的同情，贊成……</p>
<p>冠英倚立在她爹的身旁，幾次想發言，可是有點羞赧，還蠕縮地低首弄着衣襟。</p>
<p>這回——實在忍不件她心底的憤火，終於搶上來說道：</p>

<p>開篇「沈鳳喜被辱」辜負了，舊日的情人說阮劉。居然夫婿覓封侯。問心口自難言應。悔不該。別抱琵琶結鳳儔。但是，敗柳殘花君莫問。只因為，前生緣福未全修·此番舊地重相會。我豈甘，把往日交情一筆鈎。我想你，世上儘多紅粉女。一樣是，調琴鼓瑟占溫柔。不比我，道旁苦李人攀折。一任在風雨打頭。只縣君言原諒我。相隨同伴到杭州。但是，將軍權力無邊大。不別而行怎了休。縱使一時能匿跡。惟恐怕，天涯地角也難投。故而我，一時聽說難言答。不覺得，紅暈桃花滿面羞，就把那，支票一張圖欲報。數成加倍為君酬。豈知他　撕來片片成蝴蝶。飛上雲霄去不留。故而，坐上洋卓歸路去。心中鬰鬰只擔憂。</p>

<p>開篇「宮恕」</p>
<p>西宮夜靜百花香。欲捲珠廉春恨長賣妃獨坐沉香榻。高燒紅燭候君王。高力士。啟娘娘。今宵萬歲落昭陽。太眞聽說添愁悶。懶洋洋自去卸宮妝。和衣睡倒鴛衾上。見一輪明月照宮牆。孤單冷枕凄凉睡。陣陣心酸淚兩行。勸為人莫把君王伴。伴駕猶如伴虎郎。想正宮何等化容貌。何故將奴撇邊傍。倒不如。嫁一個風流子。朝歡暮樂度時光。紫薇花相對紫薇郎。</p>

<p>(Guihua) The border area between Suidong's Xinghe and Shangdu is close to Chahar North. Several hundred bandit puppet troops from Chahar North have advanced to harass the area. They have been repelled by our troops. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The situation in Suidong is increasingly tense. The puppet troops in Chahar North are becoming increasingly active. Bandit units led by Li Shou-xin and Wang Ying, etc., have already crossed the southern Hebei circle and are advancing west, pressing towards Suidong. It is also reported that there have been minor skirmishes not far from Xinghe and Shangdu. Furthermore, there is a plot by a unit under Wang Ying to bypass Bailingmiao and harass western Sui. The original Japanese residents in Guihua, numbering over twenty, and the Wan Guo Transport Company, have been gradually departing in recent days. Only two Chinese remain at the transport company to care for the place. The Jin-Sui generals are determined to defend their territory, and they intend to annihilate the bandit puppets in one fell swoop if they dare to attack. Li Gu-ying, the commander of the Datong garrison, previously went to Taiyuan with Fu Zuoyi to visit Yan, requesting instructions on defense matters. He has now returned to Datong and is proceeding to the front lines for inspection. (5th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) According to Zhangyuan telegrams, around 8:00 AM today and tomorrow, five puppet aircraft will fly from Zhangbei to Taolin and other places on the Sui border, coordinating with the puppet bandit troops under Wang Ying and Jin Jia to create disturbances in Suidong. Currently, a large number of aircraft are also gathered in the Pangjiang area of Inner Mongolia, and the cavalry command under Bao Yueqing, stationed at Jiabusi Temple, has also dispatched a large number of cavalry to concentrate at Bailingmiao, with the intention of probing Suidong. Bao himself is planning to inspect the Bailingmiao area soon. Therefore, the situation in Suidong is urgent, and the curtain of war is about to be raised. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) The Rehe puppet troops under Wu Guting advanced to Shangdu on the 5th to assist Wang Ying in attacking Sui. Wang ordered the merchants of Shangdu to prohibit the export of grain. Grain prices in the Kangbao and Binchang areas have skyrocketed. (5th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Taiyuan Zhonghe Incident; Japanese Side Still Investigating; Truth About Forced Occupation of Civilian Housing <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Kase Shunichi, an official from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Tianjin from Shenyang on the evening of the 4th to meet with Consul General Horinouchi regarding the Taiyuan Zhonghe Company case, conveying the intentions of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He departed for Ping at 11:00 AM on the 5th and will then proceed to Taiyuan for investigation. Kimura, the secretary dispatched by the Japanese Consulate in Ping to investigate this case in Taiyuan, and Sekikawa, an officer from the Japanese police station in Tianjin, are still investigating in that area.

<p>(Beiping) A Japanese aircraft inspected Taiyuan this morning and flew back to Ping in the afternoon. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the dispute over the forced occupation of civilian housing by Japanese in Taiyuan, according to news from Taiyuan, the following is a summary of the Taiyuan authorities' announcement of the incident and the homeowner's lawsuit against the Japanese. This will shed light on the truth of the matter. Details of the incident and the lawsuit are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Forced Occupation Incident: According to a statement made by the Taiyuan Public Security Bureau to local reporters, the incident was entirely caused by the forced occupation of civilian housing by Japanese nationals Takeda Sueo and Tanaka Yoshitaro. On July 26th of this year, a Hebei resident, Wang Junde, contacted the homeowner regarding renting a house at No. 4 Ansi Street in Taiyuan. The agreed rent was 50 yuan per month, with a deposit of 10 yuan paid in advance. It was stipulated that a reliable business guarantor must be found and a lease agreement signed before moving in. After Wang left, many days passed without him finding a guarantor. He then falsely claimed to the deputy street chief that he had rented the house and requested the street chief to stamp the application, which was then submitted to the municipal office. The municipal office approved the application to paint the storefront because it had the deputy street chief's stamp. Wang Junde then began to repair the storefront. The homeowner refused to allow the repair because Wang had not yet completed the guarantor and lease agreement procedures. The homeowner stated that according to Shanxi province law, if a tenant was found to be selling drugs, the property would be confiscated. Since Wang Junde was opening a pharmacy and could not find a guarantor, he could not occupy the house. From that point on, Wang disappeared. Suddenly, on October 5th, Japanese nationals Takeda Sueo and Tanaka Yoshitaro forcibly occupied the house. The homeowner, fearing that Wang Junde had deceived the Japanese, first explained to the Japanese that Wang Junde had not completed the rental agreement and asked why they were occupying the house. The two Japanese did not respond. The homeowner was helpless and contacted the police, initially notifying the two Japanese verbally, but they still did not respond. A written notice was then sent, but the two Japanese threw it on the ground without reading it. Although a copy of the written notice was sent, they still refused to leave. After negotiations lasting over twenty days, the two Japanese still refused to leave. The Public Security Bureau then deemed the forced occupation of civilian housing to be disruptive to order and, on October 21st, escorted Takeda Sueo, along with the homeowner's lawsuit, to the Japanese Consulate in Zhengzhou for legal proceedings. This is a detailed account of the incident.</p>
<p>Homeowner's Lawsuit: The homeowner's lawsuit states: "I, the homeowner, have a house at No. 4 Ansi Street in this city. Two months ago, Wang Junde verbally inquired about renting the house, saying he wanted to paint the storefront first and then obtain a reliable business guarantor to sign a contract. However, over a month passed, and Wang Junde did not complete the contract and guarantor procedures, and recently disappeared. I, the homeowner, was planning to move in myself when, suddenly, on October 5th, Japanese nationals Takeda Sueo and Tanaka Yoshitaro moved into the house, occupying it and claiming they would stay for a long time and set up a shop. I, the homeowner, believe they are making trouble unreasonably and ordered them to leave immediately. The Japanese attitude was tough, insisting on occupying the house. Despite repeated requests to leave, they ignored them. I, the homeowner, had their furniture moved outside and handed over to the police for safekeeping. I request that your bureau immediately send police to order them to move out. Otherwise, to protect my property rights, I will take self-help measures. If this causes any disruption to public order, I cannot be held responsible. I hereby declare. Furthermore, the Japanese are forcibly occupying the house and infringing on the rights of others, which is a violation of criminal law. Even if your bureau does not have jurisdiction, it should still send them to the Japanese Consulate with jurisdiction for legal punishment to maintain public order. Therefore, I respectfully submit this to Cheng, the director of the Taiyuan Municipal Public Security Bureau, by Li Xiangheng, the representative of the homeowner, on the 25th."</p>
<p>Inaccurate Japanese News Reports: It can be seen that the occurrence of this incident was entirely due to the Japanese nationals' reliance on their strength and unreasonable behavior with ulterior motives. The people's maintenance of their rights and the government's extradition in accordance with the law were all done legally. There was absolutely no anti-Japanese sentiment or attack on Japanese residents in Taiyuan. The various inaccurate reports in the Japanese media can be easily refuted.

<p>(Hong Kong) At 9:00 AM on the 5th, Huang Musong and Zeng Yangfu attended a welcome meeting hosted by various circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon at the Si Hao Hotel, attended by over 200 representatives from various organizations. At 11:00 AM, they attended a welcome meeting hosted by various Chinese circles at the Jinling Restaurant, attended by representatives from hundreds of organizations, with a very enthusiastic atmosphere. Huang and Zeng gave speeches, stating two points: 1. Protecting overseas Chinese is the government's duty, and overseas Chinese should also unite with the motherland and work hard together to fight for the survival of the nation. 2. The government will never compete with the people for profit. At 1:00 PM, they attended a lunch with Chinese legislators at the Grand Hotel. At 4:30 PM, they attended a welcome meeting at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. At 6:00 PM, they attended a banquet at the Chongzheng General Association. They are scheduled to return to the province by train early on the 6th. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) This morning, representatives of various overseas Chinese organizations in Hong Kong held a meeting to welcome Guangdong Chairman Huang Musong and Mayor Zeng Yangfu. At noon, Chinese legislators and prominent figures from the overseas Chinese community held a public banquet at the rooftop garden of the Hong Kong Hotel. In the afternoon, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce held a tea party in the assembly hall to entertain the guests. In the evening, the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce hosted a banquet at the Hong Kong Hotel, with many Guangzhou merchants and local Hong Kong bankers attending in addition to the distinguished guests. Mr. Toedte Will gave a welcoming speech on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce, hoping that the Hong Kong and Guangdong authorities could maintain frequent contact in the future, and stated that for the sake of world peace, misunderstandings between countries should be minimized and the problems that arise should be discussed sincerely. He expressed that meeting the distinguished guests from Hong Kong and Guangdong would further strengthen the friendly relations between the two regions. Toedte Will also welcomed commercial delegations to Hong Kong, saying that the closer cooperation between the two chambers of commerce would make the eagerly anticipated closer cooperation easier to achieve. Toedte Will also congratulated the central government on the success of the currency reform, hoping that the currency of Guangdong province could be integrated with the currency of the rest of China as soon as possible, which would definitely promote the revival of commerce. Toedte Will then cited the speech given by Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to France, at the League of Nations on September 29th regarding the peaceful resolution between the central government and the southwest, and the achievements of China's construction in recent years, congratulating Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the central government on unifying the country. Toedte Will also recalled what he saw during the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce members' visit to Guangdong last year, which was consistent with the American Economic Commission's statement that China's progress in the past ten years was several centuries ahead of the past. Toedte Will finally quoted Dr. Gu's words that various commercial barriers are still hindering the development of international commerce, proving that if other countries can follow Britain's example and advocate for the elimination of various barriers to international commerce, then China will surely follow suit. After Toedte Will finished his speech, Chairman Huang rose to respond, thanking him for the warm welcome and saying that he did not dare to accept the chairman's praise for China's recent progress, but that his views on commercial development coincided with his own. He said that we are willing to work together in the future to achieve this goal, and that there are two necessary conditions for the realization of this goal: one is to respect the rights and interests of other countries to enhance the friendship between merchants of various countries, and the other is to abide by the laws of other countries to maintain the order of commerce in various countries. Otherwise, there can be no development of commerce. We should work together to eliminate all obstacles to international commerce, and the development of commerce between Hong Kong and Guangdong should follow the above two principles. Then Mayor Zeng rose to talk about the results of his two-day trip to Hong Kong, saying that he had the opportunity to meet with important officials of the government, and that tonight he was able to gather with you all, and that the friendship between Hong Kong and Guangdong would surely be strengthened. He was very grateful to hear the Chairman's praise for China's progress in recent years. However, this is only the beginning of the development of industry and economic construction. We have only implemented a very small part of the national revival program set by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. Zeng continued to briefly describe the program of the late Premier, and then said that China's heavy industry has not yet begun, and that the progress in the past ten years has been achieved in the face of internal and external difficulties. Now that the country has been unified, progress should be accelerated. China has a vast land and abundant resources, but at the beginning of the Republic, everything was waiting to be done, and there were internal and external troubles at the same time, but it was still able to make some satisfactory progress in the midst of difficulties. All of these factors make people optimistic about the future prosperity and development of industry, but the development of industry and commerce still depends on the sympathy and assistance of foreigners. Industrialized countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, if they can provide economic assistance, we would be very happy to welcome them. He went on to say that many countries in the world today still only seek profit and are unwilling to mutually benefit, so the economic recession cannot be satisfactorily resolved. The problem is that everyone wants to sell their products, but no one cares about buying. If foreign individuals or groups invest in China, they should focus on mutual benefit and help China develop its productive industries, thereby increasing the purchasing power of the Chinese people. China has 450 million people, and China's prosperity will greatly contribute to the revival of world commerce and economy. If the purchasing power of the Chinese people is increased, and each person can purchase ten yuan of goods a year, then manufacturers in various countries will not have to worry about a lack of outlets, and economic adversity will not destroy the happiness of their countries again. Zeng then listed the difficulties China has encountered in recent years, such as the various problems caused by the United States' purchase of silver. But today the situation has changed, and the Chinese economy is in a favorable position. The success of the currency reform has strengthened China's credit, and the clearing of railway loans has aroused foreign goodwill. Zeng then talked about the relationship between Hong Kong and Guangdong, saying that the prosperity of the two places is mutually dependent. If there is still economic competition, both will suffer. Guangdong Province now has a great plan for economic construction, so it hopes that Hong Kong will cooperate and assist. It is hoped that everyone will be willing to do so, and that understanding and cooperation must be mutual. One-sided friendship is easy to create illusions. We should find ways to eliminate the various obstacles to commercial development in the past, such as abolishing miscellaneous taxes and several monopolies. Hong Kong has already taken action on closer cooperation, such as allowing Chinese merchant ships to dock in Hong Kong and Chinese aircraft to land. All of these things are very gratifying, and I sincerely hope that Hong Kong will continue to promote this spirit of cooperation and work in the future, and we will fully repay it with a friendly attitude. Chairman Huang and his party are scheduled to return to Guangdong by train tomorrow morning. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e11">Ministry Orders Suspension of Auctioning of April Futures Cotton Yarn <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industry believes that speculation at the Shanghai Cotton Yarn Exchange has become rampant recently. It consulted with the Ministry of Finance and the Cotton Industry Improvement Association and formulated four corrective measures, only allowing the auctioning of cotton yarn futures for four months. However, the exchange auctioned cotton yarn futures for April on the 2nd of this month, exceeding the Ministry's regulations by two months. The Ministry of Industry believes that the exchange has clearly violated Article 42 of the Exchange Law. In addition to being punished according to law, the Ministry of Industry sent a telegram to the exchange on the 5th, ordering it to suspend the auctioning of April futures cotton yarn starting from the 6th, and that all previously auctioned cotton yarn would be invalid. At the same time, the telegram ordered exchange supervisors Shi Xiaogui and Yu Kaizhan to strictly enforce the order. The following is the gist of the Ministry of Industry's telegram: "It has been determined after consultation with relevant ministries and commissions on the four corrective measures of correcting the exchange's practice of allowing speculation. The exchange was notified on the 15th of last month to comply with the order as soon as possible. However, according to the supervisors' telegram on the 3rd, the exchange auctioned April futures cotton yarn on the 2nd, which is a clear violation of Article 42 of the Exchange Law. In addition to being punished separately by this ministry according to law, you are ordered to suspend the auctioning of April futures cotton yarn starting from the 6th, without any delay. All sales and purchases of April futures cotton yarn that have already been auctioned will be invalid. The exchange will be responsible for any disputes." (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) The Sino-Aviation Company's Shanghai-Hong Kong route commenced on the 5th. The "Fujian" aircraft flew south on the morning of the 5th, arriving in Hong Kong at 2:45 PM, carrying four passengers, as well as Dane and the Far East Manager of Pan American Airlines, and a package of mail. The Governor of Hong Kong personally welcomed them at the airport. The aircraft stopped for twenty minutes before flying to the province with three passengers. (5th - Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The Hong Kong station of China National Aviation Corporation, having been permitted to establish by the British following Sino-British negotiations, the regular Shanghai-Guangdong air route commenced today. Thus, it only takes one and a half hours to travel from Hong Kong to Guangzhou. Henceforth, the six-passenger aircraft will land in Hong Kong on both southward and northward journeys. Other landing locations will be Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Shantou. Each week, both Shanghai and Guangzhou will have three flights. The journey from Shanghai to Hong Kong takes half a day, and will connect with the British Royal Air Force's aircraft flying from Hong Kong to Europe. It is rumored that Hong Kong will soon be the Far East terminus for Pan Pacific Airlines' route across the Pacific, via Manila. According to the current regulations of China National Aviation Corporation, southbound flights depart on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, arriving in Hong Kong at 2:45 PM on the same day, and departing at 3:05 PM, arriving in Guangzhou at 3:45 PM. Northbound flights depart on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays. Staff at the CNAC branch in Hong Kong expressed extreme satisfaction that China's national airline routes would connect with the British Royal Air Force and Pan American Airlines routes. It is said that this achievement is due to the efforts of Hong Kong Governor Sir Hode Geddes. He also recalled that when CNAC first began operations in 1929, there was only one aircraft flying from Shanghai to Wuhan each day, a distance of only 100 miles. This year, the distance covered by an aircraft in a single day is five times greater, totaling 2,434 miles, a distance longer than that from Shanghai to Singapore. (5th - Reuters)</p>

<p>(Washington) Senior government officials here expressed their views on the first anniversary of the implementation of China's new monetary policy, believing that the stability of the Chinese currency and the progress of the unified currency system are both satisfactory. They also said that China's financial elements have more advantages than disadvantages, but there are still some weaknesses, such as the inability to balance the budget and the instability of the situation in North China. Regarding foreign trade, China's trade deficit in the first seven months of this year was only 140 million yuan, while it was 305 million yuan in the same period last year. Currently, the reserves of China's three major government banks are approximately equal to more than 66% of the total amount of banknotes issued. The amount of banknotes at the end of 1935 was 643 million yuan, and by the end of September this year it had increased to 908 million yuan. China's trade with the United States has achieved a trade surplus. This year, China's exports to the United States totaled 55 million yuan, while imports were only 30 million yuan. From November 1935 to September 1936, China shipped a total of 65.207 million yuan of silver to the United States. Many officials believe that smuggling in North China is still a serious problem.

Imported tobacco leaves have always been under the jurisdiction of the customs, and methods for cracking down have been formulated to maintain tax revenue. It has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval to prepare, and is currently actively proceeding. (5th - Central News Agency)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance sponsored a plan for food transportation and marketing. Last week, it invited various ministries to hold a meeting to discuss and formulate a plan. It is now scheduled to invite the two ministries to hold a second meeting on the 9th. It is heard that the content of the plan is to first connect the original food parts of each competent ministry into a system, concentrate efforts, such as the Agricultural Bank's agricultural warehouses, the internal food reserves, and the Central Trust Bureau's purchases and storage. Currently, they are working separately and lack communication. How to sell them appropriately when exchanging food reserves, how to use the agricultural warehouses and reserves, and how the Trust Bureau can accurately know the storage situation in rural areas when purchasing and storing. The above-mentioned parts will be linked into a food network, and the transportation and marketing organization will be integrated into the food network. Before the establishment of the Transportation and Marketing Bureau, no new agencies will be added, and the transportation and marketing work can be handled uniformly. Whether the Food Transportation and Marketing Bureau will be established in the future will be decided by Minister Kong. (5th - Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e43">An Analysis of Recent Chinese Finances (Part Two) <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Huai-ren</p>
<p>Next, let us take a look at our finances from the expenditure side.</p>
<p>In the budget for the 25th year of the Republic, the major expenditures exceeding ten million yuan are military expenditures, debt expenditures, and subsidy expenditures. Military expenditures are more than 322 million yuan, debt expenditures are more than 239 million yuan, and subsidy expenditures are more than 106 million yuan. The sum of these three accounts for 67.3% of the total expenditure. The remaining expenditures for party affairs and national affairs are, in reality, extremely small figures. Therefore, to talk about thrift, one should first focus on the three types of expenditures: military, debt, and subsidy, and study whether there is any possibility of reducing them.</p>
<p>Regarding military expenditures, I must first point out a characteristic of Chinese military expenditures. That is, most of the consumption of Chinese military affairs is spent on the provisions of the army, and very little is used for the equipment of military weapons. It is not known exactly how many soldiers there are in China today, but it is certainly no less than two million people. Assuming each soldier's monthly salary is 24,000 yuan, plus the salaries of officers, the total cost of salaries and provisions for officers and soldiers requires about 300 million yuan. Therefore, the military expenditure of more than 320 million yuan per year can only be used for provisions. As for the purchase of military equipment, it is already out of the question. Here, I think someone may want to ask if the Chinese army does not also have airplanes and cannons? To explain this question, we must point out that although the military expenditure in the budget is only 200 million yuan, the cultural education expenditure and the construction expenditure also include a part of military-related expenditures. Moreover, the subsidy expenditure of more than 100 million yuan is the national revenue retained by various provinces, and a part of it is also used for local troops. Therefore, although the military expenditure is nominally only 300 million yuan, it is actually far more than 200 million yuan. Although China's current military expenditure is so huge, the material equipment in the military is very poor. Therefore, to save military expenditures, one can only save the provisions for soldiers. The first prerequisite is to reduce the number of soldiers. If one does not reduce the number of soldiers but reduces the provisions, it is impossible in reality. However, under the current domestic and international environment in China, how easy is it to talk about disarmament?</p>
<p>Regarding the expenditure of debt expenditures, after the compulsory borrowing and exchange of public bonds in February this year, it has generally decreased by more than 35 million yuan compared with last year. Originally, in such a year, relying on debt has become a common method internationally. In China, which is currently in such financial difficulties, it seems that it may be possible to postpone payment. However, China is acting like a "pillar of strength" and playing the role of a tough hero. This phenomenon naturally has its reasons, because China relies on the help of domestic and foreign debt in its financial outlook, so it must pay a great price to maintain the debt.</p>
<p>As for the third type of subsidy expenditure, I have said before that it is composed of national revenue retained by various provinces, and is not a genuine expenditure of the central government. Therefore, there is no way to talk about thrift. Not only that, in recent years, the local finances of various provinces have, in fact, been more difficult than those of the central government. Regarding local finances, there is an anatomy in my recent booklet, "The Morbidity and Criticism of Chinese Corrupt Politics." The book is being printed by the Life Bookstore. Therefore, the phenomenon of provinces retaining national taxes may become more prominent, and the figures in the subsidy expenditure item will certainly increase.</p>
<p>Since these three major expenditures cannot be saved, then the numbers constituting an expenditure of several million or tens of millions of yuan are, of course, even more difficult to reduce. Even if they can be reduced, the reduction will not help the matter.</p>
<p>In summary, in the future, the deficit of more than 200 million yuan in China's finances is definitely certain. In terms of financial expenditures, it is impossible to save and seek balance, not only at present but also in the future. As for tax revenue, it will probably only decrease. Under such circumstances, we can only sincerely hope that the authorities can come up with a better plan as soon as possible, and do not necessarily adhere to the promise that finances can be balanced after eighteen months. Because, according to the current situation, if one must rely on legal tender policy to balance financial revenue and expenditure, there is no other way except to inflate currency. However, currency inflation is, after all, dangerous. The "academics'" saying of limited currency inflation is completely nonsense on the tongue. Balancing financial revenue and expenditure by inflating currency, while still being able to limit it, is a miracle in the world.</p>
<p>Finally, there are some explanations. The current financial situation has reached a very difficult point. If the government cannot come up with a new financial strategy, then, even if the government does not intend to use the legal tender policy to balance financial revenue and expenditure, the imbalance of financial revenue and expenditure will probably have to affect the legal tender policy, that is, there is no choice but to go into the path of currency inflation. Because after the implementation of the legal tender policy, the issuance of banknotes has become extremely flexible. According to the "principle of least resistance," when the government balances finances, it often easily adopts the banknote policy, rather than taking the difficult but less effective tax increase and public debt policy. Moreover, at present, it is impossible to increase taxes in China's finances, and the issuance of public debt is also limited. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e44">How to Defend the Sui Frontier <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Since the bandit raids by Mongolian bandits that repeatedly harassed the Sui border were repelled by Fu Zuoyi's troops, the situation within Suiyuan seemed calm for a while. However, historical experience tells us that quiet during great turmoil is often a prelude to further deterioration. Indeed, the situation in Suiyuan has recently become tense again with the large-scale military exercises by Japanese troops in Peiping and Tianjin. The puppet army of Li Shouxin, instigated by a certain party, has advanced to Shangdu, urging Wang Ying's cavalry bandits to move westward. Skirmishes have already occurred between patrols near Taolin and Horinger. At the same time, a large batch of military supplies provided by a certain party has been transported to Shangdu. Aircraft from a certain party frequently conduct reconnaissance in the skies over eastern Suiyuan. The formal start of war is probably only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Suiyuan has now become the front line of national defense, and its position is, needless to say, extremely important. The Peiping-Suiyuan Railway, which runs across the territory, connects closely from Baotou, through Guihua, Jining, Datong, and Zhangjiakou, to Peiping and the transportation network within the Great Wall. The northern side of the railway is dominated by the Daqing Mountains, forming the Suiyuan Northeast Plateau, which also has a very important strategic position. The current confrontation between the puppet army and General Fu Zuoyi's troops is along the Daqing Mountains and the border of Chahar and Suiyuan in eastern Suiyuan. This is the gateway to Suiyuan. If it is not defended, not only will the entire province of Suiyuan be difficult to protect, but also Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Outer Mongolia will feel a great threat.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the puppet army's invasion of Suiyuan is a plan long decided by a certain party. If a certain party uses the puppet army to occupy Suiyuan, on the one hand, it can advance southwest, invade Shanxi and Shaanxi, control the Tongpu and Zhengtai Railways, and complete the military encirclement of the five provinces of North China, crossing the Yellow River to threaten Xi'an and disturb the central cities of the Northwest. On the other hand, it can advance westward, invade Ningxia, cross the Helan Mountains, pass through Alxa League, and reach Xinjiang to encircle Outer Mongolia. Therefore, the survival of Suiyuan is really related to the survival of all of China. We can easily understand this from a certain party's continental policy.</p>
<p>We must do our utmost to maintain the integrity of national territory and sovereignty, especially since Suiyuan is the gateway to North and Northwest China. Now, General Fu Zuoyi, who is stationed in Suiyuan, has repeatedly declared his determination to defend the country to the death. If the enemy dares to invade Suiyuan, he will lead his brave soldiers to inflict a heavy blow. This sincere expression of defending the country is very admirable. However, since the enemy has a far-reaching plan to invade Suiyuan, we must make more thorough preparations. Generally speaking, the government must do its utmost to strengthen the forces of the Suiyuan defense army, and the people must be determined to provide General Fu Zuoyi and others with all kinds of powerful assistance. This has become our current necessary obligation.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Eager Expectations from All Sides: Roosevelt to Unfold New Plans, Promoting World Peace After Internal Stabilization, Completing Recovery Through Trade Development <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Roosevelt's re-election as president by an overwhelming majority is tantamount to the American people giving him a completely blank check to fill in as he pleases. No president in American history has ever been granted such great power. During the election campaign, Roosevelt only made general statements on his political platform. He made no promises on the National Recovery Administration, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, the Supreme Court, or the Constitution. In the future, he can freely propose plans that he deems appropriate. Although it is extremely unlikely that the United States will join the World Court and the League of Nations, the president has not said a word to reassure people on this point. Although his new administrative plan has not yet been revealed, according to informed sources, the president's policy in his second term will focus on consolidating the foundations laid in his first term. Once the president expresses satisfaction with the tranquility of domestic affairs, he will use his increased prestige and power to work towards stabilizing the troubled world. He will first convene a peace conference in the capital of Argentina, and Secretary of State Hull will attend this meeting. Rumors suggest that Roosevelt intends to personally attend, but this has not been confirmed. It is generally believed that the president's official duties are too heavy, making it difficult for him to leave Washington for a month. The president sincerely hopes that this conference will achieve a satisfactory conclusion, because if Roosevelt can complete the unification of the Americas and create a peaceful Western Hemisphere, then his opportunity to attract the world to listen to his call for peace will increase. The president has a strong will and is unlikely to harbor any illusions of President Wilson. However, the mandate for peace and reconstruction that President Wilson received in the past cannot be compared with the mandate that Roosevelt has just received. Moreover, Roosevelt is a great idealist, so the future remains to be seen. Father Coughlin, a radio propagandist who supported the Union Party candidate Landon, commented on President Roosevelt's victory today, saying that future historians will spend less time studying Caesar and Napoleon and more time studying Roosevelt. Roosevelt can easily become a dictator. The power he holds is greater than that of any figure in history. The so-called minority is now purely a theoretical term. Smith, a famous Democrat who opposed Roosevelt in this election, also told guests that the people of the whole country have expressed their common will. The main principle of democracy is the advocacy of the majority of the people. Every citizen and every true American must now fully support President Roosevelt. Secretary of State Hull said that the results of this election prove that the United States' efforts to promote peace and its insistence on strict neutrality during wartime are more effective. Hull also guaranteed that this policy will continue as before. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(New York) According to general observers, Roosevelt's majority in this election is much larger than in 1932. This result will have a significant impact on domestic and foreign affairs. In terms of domestic affairs, some of Roosevelt's economic policies have been ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Now that the election results have proven that the people have increased confidence in the president, Roosevelt's economic policies will naturally be further strengthened in the future. Regarding foreign affairs, given the current situation in Europe, the president will also adopt a bolder policy to deal with it. Some people even believe that the president may amend the current Neutrality Act so that the ban on the export of military supplies will no longer be uniformly applied to belligerent countries, without distinguishing between aggressor and victim. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>(Washington) State Department officials announced today that the Democratic Party's overwhelming victory in the election has enabled Secretary of State Hull to intensify the implementation of trade development plans in order to seek economic recovery, thereby consolidating world peace and promoting human happiness. Trade development is beneficial to the United States and other countries. Roosevelt's re-election is a guarantee that tariffs will not be raised again. After the Inter-American Conference for the Maintenance of Peace convenes in the capital of Argentina in January next year, many new trade agreements can be established. Hull intends to submit a Western Hemisphere peace plan to the conference as a model for world peace. Other responsible persons said that the United States will likely continue to build a navy to effectively rival Britain. This navy will probably still be concentrated in the Pacific to prevent the outbreak of war in the Far East. However, if American interests in the Far East are not infringed, it will probably continue to adopt a policy of compromise towards China and Japan. The president will probably be more conservative on monetary issues in the future, but if it can help stabilize international currencies and promote world trade, the president is also willing to support it.

<p>Hyde Park. President Roosevelt received congratulatory letters and telegrams from all sides at home today like snowflakes, saying that the people's great trust proves that we are now advancing together, and his heart is filled with joy. It is believed that President Roosevelt will give the country a breathing opportunity before Congress convenes in January next year. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Topeka. Republican presidential candidate Landon laughed off his election defeat and went to the governor's office today to sort out documents in preparation for the handover in January next year. It is learned that after Landon gets rid of his governorship of Kansas, he will return to his old business of oil and gas. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>(New York) Political figures recently declared that the ministers of various departments will be changed one after another after January 1 next year. At that time, Postmaster General Farley will abandon his political career, and Secretary of Commerce Roper, Secretary of the Navy Swanson, Acting Secretary of War Woodring, Secretary of Labor Perkins, and Attorney General Cummings will also retire successively. Among them, it is said that the position of Secretary of Commerce may be filled by Mayor La Guardia of New York. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(New York) The Democratic Party's great victory in this election will cause three famous American figures to be cast off the political stage. One is Landon, the Republican candidate who failed in this election, whose governorship of Kansas has been taken by Democrat Huxman. One is former President Hoover, and the other is Smith. Smith was originally a member of the Democratic Party, but suddenly opposed Roosevelt in this election. Twenty-seven Democratic members and six Republican members have been elected as governors. Murphy, the American Commissioner to the Philippines, is currently on leave in the United States and has now been elected as the governor of Michigan. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(New York) President Roosevelt's unprecedented victory has fundamentally shaken the party structure. According to the reorganization movement of American political parties, since 1912, there have been signs. In the next four years, it seems that there will be historical progress. Pennsylvania has always been the Republican Party's base camp, but this time it has completely changed and has no power. The same is true for the New England states. However, observers carefully examine the inside of the Democratic Party and see significant cracks. Conservatives such as Senators Glass and Byrd may unite with Smith and others who opposed Roosevelt this time to seek control of the government. Moreover, the more conservative members in the South will also find it difficult to agree with the radical elements in the North for a long time. Therefore, by 1940, there will inevitably be serious disputes within the Democratic Party. However, observers also believe that Roosevelt will take advantage of the opportunity of this majority of the people's trust to carry out his administrative policies without compromising with conservative elements.

<h3 id="e47">President Roosevelt to Visit the Philippines <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Detroit. American High Commissioner to the Philippines Murphy, after being elected as Governor of Michigan, told reporters from the Associated Press today that President Roosevelt may visit the Philippines during his second term. If the president makes the trip, he will try to follow along. He also said that he will continue to perform his duties as commissioner here until he takes office as governor next January. The rumor that Murphy will be appointed as Secretary of War has been denied by Murphy today. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to reliable sources today, although American High Commissioner to the Philippines Murphy has been elected as Governor of Michigan, he will continue to be President Roosevelt's closest advisor on Philippine affairs in the future, and will also pay close attention to the preparatory talks for the economic conference to be held next year. Regarding the island's political situation, it is believed today that Roosevelt's re-election as president is very beneficial to the Philippines, because the economic relations between the two countries will not be changed, and Roosevelt is the most qualified to solve the issue of the United States maintaining a naval base in the Philippines. Secretary of State Hull's foreign policy has always advocated stability in the Pacific, and Vice President Garner has more influence over the United States' Philippine policy. Therefore, the results of this election have made it impossible for the Republican Party to advocate immediate independence for the Philippines or to increase trade barriers between the United States and the Philippines.

<p>(Nanjing) The preliminary results of the U.S. presidential election have now made it clear that the incumbent President Roosevelt has obtained an absolute majority of electoral votes. There is no doubt that he will be elected in the second election on December 10. After this news came, the people of our country expressed gratification. According to those familiar with international politics, Roosevelt is heroic and promising, not only an outstanding president of the United States, but also one of the great politicians of the modern world. Since taking office in 1933, he resolutely implemented the New Deal to restore economic prosperity. Although his achievements are still pending, domestic reforms are gradually being completed. In the next four years, he will be able to use his full strength, with a resolute and active attitude, to seek world peace and stability in East Asia, which we rely on. We will wait and see.

<p>(London) The great victory of U.S. President Roosevelt in the election has greatly surprised Germany, while Italy and France are quite pleased. German newspapers commented that the democratic countries of the world are now concentrating certain election votes, hoping that this move can change the face of the world. Italy recalled Roosevelt's non-participation in sanctions against Italy, praising Roosevelt as the most fascist-style politician in the United States. French Foreign Minister Delbos said that France is extremely pleased with Roosevelt's unprecedented victory, and said that this move can enable Roosevelt to make greater efforts to become the avant-garde of culture. Roosevelt's re-election can make the success of French-American doctrine more possible. (Reuters, 5th)</p>

The gold and silver exchanges are quite optimistic about the future of silver prices, because Roosevelt may continue to pursue the silver purchase policy.

<p>Lisbon: Spanish Nationalist forces today began shelling the southern suburbs of Madrid. Assault troops are awaiting orders to attack the city. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Rebel forces began bombing the capital city at 9:20 PM tonight. Government troops are busy deploying cannons and tanks around the city in preparation for a final battle. The sound of shelling is clearly audible in the capital. Several rebel aircraft continue to bomb the city's surrounding defenses. Two planes flew directly over the capital at noon but were driven back by government anti-aircraft fire. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The sound of shelling can be heard in the suburbs. Small units of Nationalist troops have even advanced to encamp near the city. The government has published a message to the public in newspapers, stating that rebel forces are pressing in, and "All our citizens must be prepared for battle at any moment. It is victory or death." The government has also implemented a city-wide blackout to strengthen defenses. All lights must be turned off from 10:00 PM each day. Except for militia patrolling the streets with weapons, no one is allowed to pass through. Furthermore, preparations are being made for a general mobilization order. All streets are pitch black at night, but the rumble of trucks can be heard, presumably transporting reinforcements to the front lines. Residents remain calm and show no signs of panic. Thousands of citizens are building defenses and obstacles in and around the city. (Havas Telegram, 5th)</p>

<p>Lisbon: After the Spanish Nationalist forces occupied the Getafe airfield, only nine miles from Madrid, last night, the fall of Madrid became imminent. When Nationalist General Varela personally led his troops to the town, he told news reporters, "You can inform the world that Madrid will be occupied by the Nationalist forces this week." The general also said that according to Nationalist aircraft reports, the road from Madrid to Valencia is blocked by thousands of refugees fleeing the endangered capital. In Burgos, preparations are underway to celebrate the Nationalist forces' capture of Madrid. Local Catholic churches are also preparing sacred artifacts to hold a Holy Communion to celebrate the victory. The fall of Getafe followed five hours of fierce fighting, with both sides using tanks and aircraft. The Moroccan troops finally launched a brave bayonet charge, and the government militia abandoned six tanks and retreated. The entire town has now been reduced to ashes. The Nationalist forces claim that a Russian general and two Spanish generals attempted to prevent the militia from retreating but ultimately failed. As a result of yesterday's fierce fighting, the Nationalist forces repelled the elite Asturian miners, making the Nationalist forces the masters of all of Galicia. Over a hundred miners died in yesterday's battle, abandoning several boxes of hand grenades. There was also fighting on the road from Gijón to Oviedo, with many supporters of the government killed. As a result, the government militia retreated to the town of Santander. (Reuters Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Getafe: Two columns of Nationalist forces on the south side of the capital, one led by Lieutenant Colonel De la Puente, departing from Fuenlabrada, and the other led by Colonel Barron, departing from the village of Parla, engaged in fierce fighting with government troops.

By this time, the main force of the government troops had already retreated, leaving only a few hundred militiamen ambushed in some houses in the town, continuing to open fire to provide cover. At 2:30 PM, the airfield's oil depot in the town was hit by a shell and caught fire, with thick smoke rising. Half an hour later, the last batch of militiamen also completely withdrew. The town of Getafe was then under the control of the Nationalist forces. More than a dozen militiamen surrendered to the Nationalist forces and told our reporter that they had arrived in Getafe from the capital three days ago.

Although government troops were dispatched from the towns of Torrelodones and Villaviciosa de Odón in an attempt to counterattack, they were all repelled. The main force of the Nationalist army, commanded by General Varela, commander of the central route, is no more than 15 kilometers from the capital. The government troops defending the "Cuatro Vientos" airfield have now withdrawn. The original 14 aircraft in the airfield have also flown away.

Those who disobey will be treated as rebels." The Ministry of the Army has also ordered all militiamen on leave to return to their units and await orders. In addition, the Ministry of the Army issued a war report at 9:45 PM, acknowledging that the rebel forces are pressing towards the south of Madrid but stating that the government troops are still resisting with all their might.

<p>(London) At today's meeting of the Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War, the main event was the discussion of the Soviet Union's reply to Germany's accusation of treaty violation. The representatives of Italy and the Soviet Union engaged in a verbal conflict in the meeting. After the Italian Ambassador to the UK spoke, the Soviet Ambassador to the UK, Maisky, immediately stated, "Italian Ambassador Grandi even mocks the tragic bombing of women and children in Madrid. I believe Mr. Grandi must be a great enemy of women and children, showing no sympathy for their suffering. I am not surprised by this, because the creed represented by Mr. Grandi is the most brutal and hateful war in the world. We have long seen examples of Italy completely disregarding human suffering. This is not the first time this has happened." The representatives of Italy and Germany at today's meeting unanimously refuted the Soviet Union's response, especially regarding the four Soviet Gorky-factory-produced bombers that arrived at the Getafe airfield in Madrid on September 18. Soviet Ambassador Maisky stated that there is no bomber or aircraft manufacturing plant named Gorky in the Soviet Union. Before the adjournment, the committee asked the Soviet Ambassador to further inquire with his home government about the points raised by Germany, and then submit the results to the committee.

<p>(Paris) Today, French Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Daladier declared that France's famous "Maginot Line" will be extended northward to the sea, and the solid fortifications built will be the same as those in Alsace-Lorraine. The area opposite the salient of the Ruhr region, which has not yet been armed due to the Treaty of 1814, will also have fortresses built. At the same time, the Jura region opposite the Swiss border will also be prepared with armaments to prevent invaders from violating Swiss neutrality. Daladier also stated that he intends to request an appropriation of 5 million pounds from the National Assembly to complete the border defenses. This project, with the extended portion, will be about 600 kilometers in length. (Reuters Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Daladier also announced that the government intends to adopt a youth compulsory military training system. All men over the age of seven or eight who have not enlisted should be forced to join training camps for short-term training. Youths under the age of eighteen should be required to take gymnastics as a compulsory subject in schools. The government will soon formulate laws for this military training system and submit them to the National Assembly for approval. The implementation of the law on nationalizing the arms industry, which was passed in July, has been quite satisfactory. In the past, military industries were concentrated in one place, which was inconvenient in the event of war. In the future, according to the law, 600 military supplies manufacturing plants can be set up throughout the country. (Havas Telegram, 4th)</p>

In addition, a Minister of Propaganda is added to position the Left Republican Esplá. After the cabinet reshuffle was completed, Prime Minister Caballero gave a speech, stating, "I believe that all forces that are anti-fascist should share government responsibility in the current environment. That is why I invited the anarchists to join the cabinet." He then issued a proclamation, stating, "Countrymen, all forces that are opposed to fascism have been recruited. I will tell the people the truth about the situation so that the people will rise up and defend the capital. What is the truth? It is that the enemy is now gathered around the capital.

<p>(Paris) The second temporary session of the National Assembly is scheduled to open this afternoon. Parliamentary groups of various parties held meetings this morning to determine their positions on the government's proposals, especially the reform of the financial system for provinces and cities. When the parliamentary group of the orthodox Socialist Party opened the meeting, it first listed all the issues that the National Assembly should discuss during this session and explained that the government authorities' tax reform plan should be submitted first so that the Senate could submit it for discussion during the National Assembly's debate on the budget bill in order to save time. Finance Minister Olivol also stated that the government has decided to make every effort to compromise in accordance with the rules of procedure to ensure that the next budget bill can be passed this year. When the parliamentary group of the Communist Party held a meeting, it expressed support for the speech given by the party secretary-general, Thorez, on the 30th of last month, advocating the cessation of the sealing off of the Spanish government. Regarding this matter, the party's congressman, Bellay, has submitted a question to the Secretariat of the National Assembly and requested the National Assembly to submit it for discussion within a short period of time. In addition, the party also intends to raise a number of other questions, advocating effective means to dissolve various fascist groups and advocating that those who "sabotage" social laws must be punished.

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese army has recently expressed its opinion advocating the abolition of party politics. The reactions of the Seiyukai and Minseitō parties to this advocacy are now becoming stronger. Activities to consolidate a common front to protect the constitutional system are now quite strong. Cabinet party members have also declared their determination to defend party politics. This wave of unrest in the political world is now rapidly expanding. However, according to general observation, since the above-mentioned problem is quite serious, if the opinion of eliminating party politics continues to spread, it will make the determination to protect party politics even higher, and this may cause a crisis. Therefore, before the recess of the next national food season next spring, the opposing side does not seem to be making further opposition to party politics. (Central News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the issue of reforming the parliamentary system arose, the Seiyukai was greatly impacted. As a result, the voice of advocating the protection of constitutional government within the party suddenly became stronger. At the meeting of the Policy Research Committee on the 4th, all members expressed strong opinions, opposing fascism. Unanimously, it was agreed that the attitude of political parties has always been too passive, so there are often voices criticizing political parties. At this time, political parties must clearly express their own views and decisively reject European and American fascism. The Policy Research Committee should base its spirit on this and quickly decide on concrete methods. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that Chairman Sunada would draft countermeasures for the Seiyukai in times of emergency, and after obtaining the party's approval, declare it to the inside and outside.

At 8 PM, they took a special train eastward with Vice Commander Zhang, He Yaozu, Xu Yongchang, Fu Zuoyi, Gao Guizi, and Gao Shuangcheng, arriving in Luoyang at 7:40 AM on the 31st. After disembarking, they immediately met with Chairman Chiang at the Luoyang Military Branch School. At 9 AM, they celebrated Chairman Chiang's birthday on a specially prepared platform outside the main gate of the Military Branch School. Vice Chairman Yan served as chairman. Chairman Chiang wore military fatigues and was in excellent spirits. At 11 AM, various circles in Luoyang hosted a banquet for Chairman Chiang and his wife at Siwei Hall in the Military School, with about a hundred participants. The Military School specially prepared a Vice Chairman's office for Yan. Before 11 AM, Chiang visited Yan in casual clothes for talks. At 7:30 PM, Chiang hosted a banquet at Siwei Hall. When Chairman Chiang and Vice Commander Zhang saw him off at the airfield when they took off from Luoyang today (the 1st), Chiang and Yan talked and walked at the airfield for about ten minutes before boarding the plane and taking off." After Yan returned to Taiyuan, he attended the memorial week meeting of the Shanxi and Suiyuan provincial governments this morning (the 2nd) and reported his impressions after meeting Chiang in Luoyang and his opinions on national affairs, as follows: "This trip to Xi'an and Luoyang was very rewarding. I feel that everything in the country is making great progress. In particular, the population of Xi'an is increasing rapidly, the streets are neat, and land prices are soaring, which is very significant. Grain prices in both places have risen due to the planting of winter wheat to seventy percent, but after government regulation, they have also fallen. As for the future of the country, the central government still adheres to the principle of seeking national salvation through limited compromise and striving for reconciliation. No matter what kind of violent invasion comes, it will resolutely resist to defend the national territory." (November 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Tension Rises Again on the Chahar-Suiyuan Border; Bandit Troops Advance Westward; Li Shouxin and Wang Ying's Troops Serve as the Backbone of the Invasion of Suiyuan; Rehe Bandit Troops Move to Support Li and Wang; Residents of Shangyi's Nanchaoqian Have Fled En Masse <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Shangdu Dispatch: Recently, the situation on the Chahar-Suiyuan border has been tense and relaxed at times, and people are worried and uncertain. Recently, Wang Ying's bandit troops have been trained by a certain party and are responsible for the main role in invading Suiyuan. In addition, Li Shouxin, the most trusted puppet army commander of Zhangbei of a certain party, is also an important figure in the westward invasion, and has also obtained the power of a certain party to supply the Chahar bandit troops with military supplies, coordinating with Wang Ying to advance together. Therefore, the Chahar-Suiyuan border has recently shown signs of tension again, and the bandit troops are advancing westward. According to people from Zhangbei, the total number of Rehe bandit troops assembled in the hunting grounds has exceeded 10,000. Recently, they have received orders from a certain party to transfer 6,000 people from the assembled bandit troops to Duolun by the 10th of this month. The Rehe bandit troops currently stationed in Duolun, numbering about 4,000, have also moved westward, with the destination being the Baochang-Kangbao area, approaching Shangdu to support Wang Ying and Li Shouxin's invasion of Suiyuan. Now, bandit troops are constantly transporting materials between Duolun, Baochang, and Kangbao.</p>
<p>The residents living in the Shangdu-Shangyi (ie Daqinggou)-Nanchaoqian area are disturbed by the frequent mobilization of bandit troops and busy transportation. Moreover, when bandits pass through the area, they either demand food and fodder or requisition strong men and mules and horses. If the supply is delayed even slightly, they are whipped immediately and arbitrarily harassed. Farmers' sheep and chickens are slaughtered and eaten at will. Generally, those with some assets cannot bear the disturbance, so they have mostly fled, mostly to Zhangjiakou or Datong. Only the poor people are unable to move and take refuge, and can only obey fate and let them trample on them. Li Shouxin, the puppet army commander of the main force of the westward invasion, in order to understand the true situation of the troops' strength and military supplies, specifically set out from Zhangbei on the 6th of this month, and planned to first go to Sanbaogou-Daqinggou-Nanchaoqian area to inspect the deployment of his troops in the western Chahar area, whether the defense works of the positions were solid, and to give speeches to the soldiers at the front to encourage the Zhang bandits. Secondly, he went to Gonghui-Mantouying to inspect his support troops, and then returned to Zhangbei. Whether the number of troops was sufficient, whether the clothing was neat, and whether the food, fodder, and ammunition were sufficient would be actively sought and supplemented after this inspection in order to increase its strength.</p>
<p>The military supplies needed by the puppet bandits in northern Chahar are concentrated in Zhangbei as a distribution point, and the number of goods transported in and out every day is endless and cannot be counted. According to statistics, on the 31st of last month alone, Li Shouxin used 45 trucks to transport a large amount of military supplies from Zhangbei, 13 trucks to Daqinggou, including 1 truck of rifles, a total of 18 boxes, 10 rifles per box, a total of 180 rifles, 3 trucks of artillery shells and bullets, 1 truck of tents, 3 trucks of gasoline and kerosene, and 5 trucks of coal; 16 trucks to Nanchaoqian, including 4 trucks of bullets and artillery shells, 6 trucks of gasoline and kerosene, and 6 trucks of coal. In addition, there were 7 trucks of coal and 4 trucks of bullets to Shangdu, and a total of 6 trucks of firearms and bullets to Jiabusi. (2nd)</p>

<p>Nanjing Dispatch: He Jian flew from Hunan to Wuhan and then to Nanjing on the 28th of last month to present three aircraft to the central government and congratulate Chairman Chiang on his birthday. Now that the official business is completed, he took a plane back to Hunan at 8 AM on the 5th. It is said that He is very busy presiding over Hunan's provincial affairs, and the government has recently established many new border area pacification agencies. The Changsha Pacification Headquarters seems to have no need to be retained, so he submitted a document to the Military Affairs Commission two months ago, requesting the abolition of the Changsha Pacification Headquarters. Now that the abolition of the headquarters has been realized, he believes that he has returned to his original position.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Yuehan Railway: Two Train Collisions in the Chen County Section; More Than Thirty People Killed in the Dengjiawan Tragedy; More Than Ten People Killed or Injured in the Donglou Bridge Accident <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: In the past three months, unfortunate incidents have occurred frequently on the country's railways. Since the Yuehan Railway started direct trains, there have been four train collisions. The accident on the 22nd of last month involving the 94th passenger-freight mixed train in the Leheng area near Taipingli and Dengjiawan was particularly tragic. The Yue Railway Office in Guangzhou sent Cheng Xiaogang, Director of the Transportation Department, to the scene of the accident to investigate. After Cheng arrived at Dengjiatang, he inspected and registered the bodies of the victims separately and prepared 36 coffins for burial. In addition, there were 6 unknown passengers who were buried locally in Dengjiatang. The soldiers of the special platoon of the 199th Regiment of the 67th Division who were killed and injured were taken back to the division headquarters for coffin burial. The vehicles that collided on that day were completely disintegrated, and the adjacent carriages were also damaged. The locomotives were transported to the Chenzhou Locomotive Factory for repair. Ling Hongdong, Director of the Yuehan Railway Bureau, also went to Chenzhou at the end of last month and then went to Dengjiatang to inspect everything. After several days of investigation, he left Chenzhou and returned to Wuhan on the 31st of last month. The Ministry of Railways sent Jin Shiyi, Director of the Business Department, and Niu Xiaoxian, Director of the Finance Department, to the south to investigate the situation along the way. Jin and Niu arrived in Guangzhou on the 1st and inspected the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway on the 2nd. Unexpectedly, the Dengjiatang case had not yet been investigated, and on the 1st of this month, there was another train collision at the Donglou Bridge Station near Chenzhou. The Yuehan Railway Office in Guangzhou immediately sent a hand-cranked engineering vehicle to rescue and repair the tracks. It was found that the location of the collision was near the Xiaoshuipu Donglou Bridge Station, which is more than ten kilometers north of Bang County. First, a military train carrying soldiers opened northward from Lechang. When it arrived near Donglou Bridge, there was a slope with low drops on both ends. Vehicles encountering or approaching on both sides were often not easy to see from a distance. When the military train drove to the bottom of the slope, at about 7 AM one morning, a northbound passenger-freight train from Yuehan came from behind (the train departed from Guangzhou at 11 PM on the 30th). Because the locomotive was a new-style express train, the speed was higher than that of the old locomotive. When it drove to Donglou Bridge Station, it was blocked by the height of the slope and did not find the military train in front. Finally, it caught up at the mileage of 602 to 650 of Donglou Bridge Station and pushed against the rear of the military train, destroying the military train in front. At the same time, the northbound locomotive and two freight cars also derailed and pressed against the orange railing, fortunately not falling into the river. After the two trains collided, more than ten people died on the spot. After the accident, Donglou Bridge Station was blocked by the stranded vehicles, and traffic was interrupted for a time. The direct train from Wuchang to the south could not pass when it drove to the station, so it had to stop abruptly, and then took the passengers from Guangzhou back to Wuhan. At the same time, the northbound accident locomotive was also repaired and took the southbound train passengers to Guangzhou. Therefore, the passengers on this southbound train did not arrive safely at Huangsha Station in Guangzhou until 12 noon on the 2nd. After the damaged tracks and sleepers were repaired by the engineering vehicle, the section of the road could be operated as usual on the 3rd. After reporting to the Ministry of Railways, it immediately telegraphed the two directors Jin and Niu, who were in Guangdong, to investigate the train collision at Donglou Station when they went north, so as to find ways to remedy the safety of future train operations.

<p>At the Yangdianxiang Purchasing Cooperative in Dongshi, Yexie Town, Punan, five or six bandits suddenly came the night before last, speaking a mixture of local and Hakka dialects, each holding guns and breaking into the house. One bandit pointed a gun at the accountant, Ding, to monitor him and prevent him from making a sound. The remaining bandits dispersed to search for loot. Manager Jiang Heming was lying in the next room. Hearing the sound, he immediately escaped through the back door, but was hit in the waist and back by a wooden stick by the bandit on lookout, and fell to the ground. At this time, the neighbors also heard the sound, so they rang the alarm. Knowing that the matter was not good, the bandits did not have time to carry the loot and roared away.</p>

<p>Recently, robberies have been frequently heard in Suzhou, and people cannot sleep peacefully. Previously, a sailing boat traveling between Jiaozhi and Suzhou encountered two bandit boats yesterday while passing through the Wusong River. Seven or eight bandits blocked the road and robbed them, and they were robbed of about 600 yuan of goods and money entrusted to them by various shops. The police station in charge immediately sent a police team to pursue and suppress them, but there was no trace. In addition, Captain Li of the Wujiang Water Patrol Team and others led detectives to Suzhou the day before yesterday and arrested three escaped criminals from the Zhouzhuang robbery case, Du Chunlin, Jiang Guilin, and Wang Decai, in a teahouse outside Panmen. They were immediately escorted to Wujiang for interrogation and handling.</p>

<p>Tang Xiaosheng, an administrator of the Qingxiang Office in the third district of the county, was collecting factory funds from opium smokers on the afternoon of the 1st of this month when Tang Zhanxiu, Tang Jinfu, Tang Shengfu, Tang Fajin, etc., learned of it, knocked Tang Xiaosheng down and tied him up, filled his mouth with mud, and searched for and robbed him of more than 20 yuan of fund banknotes and foreign money. Later, passers-by Tang Boying and Cai Suolong saw it, untied him, removed the mud from his mouth, and asked about the robbery. Tang Xiaosheng immediately reported it to the Erling Public Security Sub-station, which sent a shock to arrest the principal offenders Tang Jinfu and Tang Zhanxiu. The remaining ones escaped. It is heard that the sub-station has transferred the two offenders to the General Bureau for transfer to the county for handling according to law.</p>

Unexpectedly, it has gradually fallen recently to 2,950 copper coins, and there is still a tendency to continue falling, which has a great impact. In view of this, the county government specifically announced on the 2nd that it would still follow the Ministry's regulations of exchanging 3,000 copper coins per yuan, and must not fall below the statutory decree of the Ministry, and ordered the County Chamber of Commerce to instruct the industry associations to comply.</p>

<p>Recently, the county has been dry due to the weather, and fires have occurred for days. Unexpectedly, a fire broke out outside the South City again at 4 PM yesterday. After hearing the news, the fire brigades rushed to rescue. At that time, the Nancha Township People's School was training. Suddenly, they saw black smoke billowing in front. Wang Bowu, the principal of the school, and Song Peisen, the instructor, bravely led the trainees to rescue. At that time, because the southeast wind was strong, the fire was even more intense. In a short while, eight families, including Jin Guanglong, Hu Sanzhang, Zhang Jiating, Wang Haozi, Qiang Jiasheng, and Wang Youdian, were burned to the ground. It is estimated that more than 20 houses were burned down, with losses of thousands of yuan. Among them, Wang Haozi's eight-month-old fetus was not taken out in time, resulting in being buried in the fire. The situation was extremely tragic.</p>

<p>Since entering autumn, Hangzhou has been dry for a long time, and it has been almost two months. Although there has been a welcome rain recently, the water volume is still not very sufficient. In order to prevent drought disasters, the Construction Department plans to open the 300-horsepower water pump installed at the Zhakou Pumping Station for ten days to pump the water from the Qiantang River into the river to facilitate irrigation and fill the urban area with firewood. The machine can pump 1.5 million gallons of water per hour, 30 million gallons of water per day, and the cost is 1,500 yuan, which is borne equally by the provincial and municipal governments. It is scheduled to start pumping water on the 6th. However, according to the chemical inspection report of the Waterworks, the salinity of the Qiantang River water has reached 8 parts per thousand, and it is not suitable for drinking or irrigation. Therefore, it is planned to pump it in when the salinity is reduced to 4 parts per thousand for application.</p>

<p>The Dayuan Bank on Jiangxia Street in this port has always been operating steadily. There are currently 13 partners, 7 apprentices, and 3 clerks.

After the partner Fan, who was in charge of the silver box, locked it, he went to bed separately. Unexpectedly, when he got up the next morning, he saw a large hole chiseled in the wall of the adjacent empty house. Knowing that something was wrong, he rushed to see the silver box and saw that it had been opened. He checked the national currency and found that more than 5,000 yuan was lost. He reported the information to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau and the Ningbo Detective Team, and each sent detectives to the scene to investigate.

<h3 id="e81">The Ancient City of Beiping Under the Sound of Wheels – Random Notes on a Parade of Japanese Troops Through the City <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>For the last eight or nine days, the large-scale military exercises of the Japanese troops has thrust the area around Beiping-Tianjin-Fengtai into a state of unease and alarm. The suburbs of Beiping have long been disturbed and restless, with everyone on edge. However, the city of Beiping itself has been able to maintain a semblance of normality due to being under the supervision of the various foreign legations. Although the sound of artillery fire has been faintly audible throughout the day, peace and prosperity, with singing and dancing, has continued as before. However, the Japanese troops have not abandoned their intention to demonstrate their power to the residents of the city. Therefore, on the day before the conclusion of their "autumn maneuvers" (the 3rd), they held a parade through the city.</p>
<p>The route of the parade was from the Chaoyangmen, on the northeast corner of the city, through the prosperous areas of Dongsi, Dongdan, East and West Chang'an Streets, Xidan, and so on. At Xidan, the procession divided into two streams. One went south to Xuanwumen, through Zhangyimen Avenue, to Guang'anmen on the southwest corner of the city; the other went north to Xizhimen on the northwest corner of the city. The length of the route was about ten to twenty li in total. The parade was carried out in a way that completely simulated the retreat and pursuit of combat, with the front teams retreating and the rear teams in hot pursuit. In this retreat and pursuit, the intention of the parade through the city was implied.</p>
<p>At about 8 o'clock, the team simulating a defeated retreat began to enter Chaoyangmen. At the front were three small motorcycle trikes, each carrying two people, one driving and one holding a machine gun. Behind them were three sedan cars. Each car was occupied by three to five officers. A glimpse revealed that most had a short mustache on their lips. After this, large trucks full of Japanese troops came in a whirlwind, one after another. After a slight break after the trucks, another small motorcycle appeared. After this, tanks, large trucks, supply vehicles, small motorcycles, sedan cars, artillery vehicles, and so on came on continuously, sometimes in teams of several vehicles, sometimes with slight gaps, the rumble of their engines deafening. The dust raised by the vehicles shook the roads, and the houses trembled. This continued for about three hours, until it ended at half past eleven. Statistics show that there were more than a hundred vehicles of all kinds, and about 1,500 to 1,600 officers and soldiers. The exteriors of all these vehicles were uniformly painted in grayish-yellow. The large trucks full of soldiers were entirely draped in camouflage grass, closely resembling the situation in combat against aerial bombardment. The tops of the tanks were mostly equipped with anti-aircraft machine guns, with one person sitting beside them, preparing to aim and shoot at the sky. The uniforms of the officers and soldiers were all grayish-yellow, the same color as the vehicles. Many wore masks and glasses, and the red bands on the officers' hats were extraordinarily bright, most striking in the rolling dust and sand. It was also heard that hundreds of infantrymen entered the city through Guangqumen.</p>
<p>Everywhere the Japanese troops passed, the sides of the streets were crowded with spectators, but the pushing and urging of the police was of no avail. This reporter witnessed three people, the owner and his servants, from a sesame cake shop argue and quarrel because they had all gone to the roadside to watch, resulting in the loss of some cakes. He also saw a silk shop closing its doors at that time, with the entire staff watching from the doorway. Pedestrians on the road, except those who had pressing matters to attend to, also mostly stopped to watch, and their expressions were mostly worried. For even the most composed individuals found it difficult to calm their minds and go about their business in the midst of this rumbling of vehicles.</p>
<p>At this time, the expatriates from "friendly nations" were mostly in high spirits. North of Dongdan, there were rows of "friendly nation" elementary school students, dressed very neatly, as if attending a grand ceremony. As the Japanese troops passed by, they cheered and applauded loudly. The sun-shaped national flags of their countries were also hung high at the entrances of various private residences. Particularly striking among these were three locations: the Zhonghe Pharmacy on Dongdan Avenue, the Dongya Bookstore on the same street, and a certain shop near Wangfu and the adjacent Wangfujing Street. The flags hung in these three places were extraordinarily large and new, seemingly recently made. "Friendly nation" women, dressed neatly and made up with rouge and powder, and their backs slightly hunched, dragged their thick, wide clogs, walking back and forth on the street like shuttles. Their hearts seemed to have boundless joy, with no way to vent it, causing my fellow Chinese compatriots watching on the sides of the road to avert their eyes and comment.</p>
<p>Among the columns of Japanese military vehicles, there were often American cars mixed in. Sometimes they were sedan cars, with one or two American people sitting inside, and sometimes they were also American women. According to this reporter's estimation, there were a total of three women driving themselves. Most of these American people were probably news reporters, followed by members of the diplomatic corps. Ordinary expatriates who followed along purely out of curiosity were probably not many. Or they were freight trucks, with three to five soldiers sitting on them, leaning back with their legs crossed, sometimes smiling. There were about ten to twenty of these freight trucks mixed in with the Japanese military vehicles. When the Chinese people saw them, their worry was slightly tempered by excitement. They often responded with a bitter smile. This kind of mentality is also the norm. It is heard that they were also conducting exercises outside the city, and were returning on this day. When this reporter walked past the East Legation Quarter, he saw that expatriates from other countries were also coming out one after another to watch in various places. It can be seen from this that they were concerned about this parade by the Japanese troops.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Two World Professional Tennis Giants, Tilden and Vines, Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday; Performance at 1 PM Today; Will Take Original Ship to Hong Kong Tonight; Return to the US by Original Ship After Manila Performance <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Two giants of the world professional tennis scene, Tilden and Vines, who once held the reins of world amateur tennis, and Ms. Harbutt, a professional female tennis player, arrived here yesterday at 8:00 AM aboard the President Lincoln from Japan. Yesterday, they were busy with social engagements and sightseeing. Starting at 1:00 PM today, at the Canavero court at 153 Route Notre Dame, the two gentlemen will give a ticketed public performance. Tonight, they will take the original ship to Hong Kong and then on to Manila. A brief account of the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Early</p>
<p>The Lincoln, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this morning, arrived a day early, entering port yesterday morning. Among those welcoming them at the new Customs Wharf were Canavero, a local professional tennis player, and Boer from Puda Trading Company, which is in charge of this business venture. After exiting the new Customs Wharf, Tilden and Vines went directly to the International Hotel to rest, arriving around 9:30 AM. Both are tall and robust, showing no signs of travel fatigue.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Social Engagements</p>
<p>At noon yesterday, the two gentlemen attended a banquet hosted by the American Club on Fuzhou Road. Last night, Citibank also hosted a welcome banquet. At 9:00 PM, they attended the opening ceremony of the new "Shall We Dance" dance hall on Jing'an Temple Road, keeping them very busy. From 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM in the afternoon, they practiced at the Notre Dame Road court to stretch their muscles. Canavero and local star players, including McGer Tagping and Xian Daimingfa, also participated.</p>
<p>Today's Performance</p>
<p>Starting at 1:00 PM this afternoon, the two gentlemen will perform singles and doubles matches at the Brocklin court at 153 Route Notre Dame. Ms. Harbutt will not be able to perform due to the lack of an opponent. The order of the performance is as follows:</p>
<p>Singles: Tilden vs. Vines - Three Sets</p>
<p>Doubles: Dai Mingfa &amp; Wang Miaosong vs. Cai Houfa &amp; Wang Miaoxing - Two Sets</p>
<p>Doubles: Tilden &amp; Tao Maonan vs. Vines &amp; Canavero - Three Sets</p>
<p>Vines' Remarks</p>
<p>Vines made the following remarks during the trip: Tilden and I performed four times together in Tokyo, with each performance attracting around 10,000 spectators. After leaving Tokyo, we toured Nagoya, Osaka, and other places, continuing to perform. We held so-called "instructional" performances in Japan, using only one referee. Japan's top player, Yamagishi, participated in the "instructional" performances multiple times. According to my observation, Yamagishi's skills rank between eighth and fifteenth in the world. The techniques of Japanese tennis players are becoming increasingly modernized. Their only shortcomings are a lack of imagination and speed. As for the future of professional tennis, I am very optimistic. However, the confrontation between the amateur and professional worlds may not occur for at least five or six years because the organization of professional tennis associations is not yet sound.</p>
<p>Among the world's amateur players, Pancho Segura still slightly outranks Budge Patty and Gardnar Mulloy. However, Patty and Mulloy are improving rapidly and will one day surpass Segura. Whether England can retain the Davis Cup next year depends on whether Segura maintains his amateur status. The chances for the United States, Australia, and Germany are equal. France's strength is still insufficient. Coen is more advanced than before, but Vines has not met Coen in two years. The travel plan has been set. There will be a singles performance in Hong Kong, followed by Manila. As for the trip to South Africa, it is unlikely to happen because there has been no contact between the two parties. Therefore, after the Manila performance, we will return to the United States. Tilden has scheduled matches in the US, and Vines is eager to return home to see his wife and daughters.</p>
<p>Tilden's Remarks</p>
<p>According to Mr. Tilden, this is the first time that Vines and I have visited the Far East for sightseeing. Everything feels vibrant. We stayed in Japan for about a month, performing more than ten times in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and other places, and received much praise from the local people. Chinese tennis has also made considerable progress in recent years. I have been involved in tennis for thirty-five years, starting at the age of seven when I was studying at primary school and have enjoyed it ever since. When asked about the trip to Australia and whether it had been canceled, and whether he could perform again when passing through Shanghai on the return trip, Tilden said that the trip to Australia had been canceled. The southward journey will end in Manila, and we will take the original ship back home. We must return to the United States by Christmas. Therefore, whether we can stop in Shanghai on the way back will have to be telegraphed from Manila. He hopes to perform in Shanghai again, and perhaps it will be possible.</p>
<p>Brief Biographies of Tilden and Vines</p>
<p>Tilden is 43 years old this year and began his tennis career at the age of 17 in 1919. While studying at the University of Pennsylvania, he had already become one of the famous figures in the world of tennis. He dominated the tennis world for 17 years and is still one of the strongest players in the world. He graduated from university in 1922. In 1920, he won the US Open singles title, winning it six consecutive years until 1926 when he was defeated by Lacoste of France. He won it again in 1927. He won the Wimbledon title three times in 1920, 1921, and 1930. He was 38 years old the last time, while Tilden was 28 years old.</p>
<p>Vines is 23 years old this year. In 1931, at the age of 18, he won the US Open singles title. He won it again in 1932. In the same year, he also won the Wimbledon title. He got married at the age of 10. Experts observe that, even among the best in the world today, including Pancho Segura, few can defeat Vines. Vines is still young and has a bright future.</p>

<p>Le Xiurong, chairman of the Shanghai Chinese Sports Referees Association, is enthusiastic about sports and is one of our country's most famous referees. He has been hired to referee major competitions in Shanghai. His sharp eyesight and fair judgments have won over not only the Chinese but also Westerners. Originally, due to difficult circumstances, Le had announced his retirement and would no longer run on the field, but would instead focus on training work to cultivate future referee talent. Now, because the Football Match for Offering Aircrafts to Celebrate Longevity will be held at Shen Garden on the 8th, which is a major event for the people to respect their leaders and love their country, it is imperative to have exceptional talent serve as the important referee. Le, with his strong patriotism, has agreed to take up the role again after repeated urging from both Chinese and Westerners. It is also said that after officiating the Aircraft Offering Longevity Celebration match, he will continue to officiate various important competitions. Western newspapers in the city believe that Le's return to the sports scene will greatly benefit the future of sports.</p>

<p>Shen Siliang, the Director-General of the All-China Athletic Federation, in conjunction with the Shanghai Aircraft Purchase Longevity Celebration Memorial Committee, has specially requested the Western football clubs to arrange a match between the French Business Football Team and the East China Football Team to be held at Shen Garden on November 8th (Sunday) at 3:00 PM. It is known that the French Business Team leads the Western football teams and has strong ambitions to win the Group A Football Championship. The East China Football Team is the leader of the Chinese teams, and the return of "Little Black Charcoal" Chen Zhenhe this season has made the team even stronger and also harbors ambitions to win various championships this season. Both teams will definitely put forth their best effort, and the outcome of the match will determine who is the hegemon of Shanghai. The news has caused football fans to rejoice. It is said that the Aircraft Purchase Longevity Celebration Memorial Committee has specially set up 500 two-yuan seats on the sidelines, which went on sale yesterday at the Shen Garden and the YMCA Building on Eight Immortals Bridge. Those who want to purchase reserved seats must go early, or they will miss out.</p>
<p>The lineup for the East China and French Business teams in the longevity celebration match has already been set.

<p>The Xin Team basketball team held a friendly match with the Marines team last night at the Shen Garden basketball court. As a result, the Xin Team lost to the Marines with a score of 36 to 43. Locke of the Marine Corps, who has now returned to the Shanghai team, scored 29 points alone with his innate tall stature and the cooperation of the other players. Together with the swiftness of his forward, Komes, they are a rare talent.</p>
<p>In the early days of the Xin team's formation, individual skills were excellent. However, once encountering a strong opponent, the players have not yet achieved the beauty of a perfect combination.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau issued a circular to all schools in the city, stating: "According to a report submitted by Gu Yuqi, Dean of the Private Datong Medical College, in view of the importance of public health and the urgent need to promote tuberculosis prevention, the college has decided to conduct tuberculosis X-ray screening. To promote widespread screening, each person is charged only one yuan for the procedure. Students in secondary schools are charged only 80 cents each time, and primary school students are charged 60 cents. From September 1st to the end of September, a total of 428 people came to the college for screening, including 216 students. Among them, eight students had recovered from lung disease, and seventeen were in the early stages, accounting for a strong 24%. This phenomenon is alarming, considering the small number of students screened. The college originally focused on screening students and teachers. However, since the number of students is limited, and no teachers have been screened, it is necessary to actively promote this work. It is proposed that the bureau again issue a circular to all schools in the city to implement screening in order to emphasize public health and prevent the spread of disease. A form is attached for your reference. Therefore, as the college had previously requested the former Municipal Education Bureau to issue a circular to all schools to implement X-ray screening of students' lungs, we are now issuing this circular and requiring all schools to strictly comply."</p>

<p>— Jiang Huaiqing</p>
<p>Tilden, who devoted his life to tennis, is now forty-two years and nine months old and has never married. When he was performing in Japan, a journalist interviewed him and asked why he didn't marry. Tilden smiled and shook his head, seemingly disapproving of the question, feeling it was meddlesome. Even if marriage would not affect his career, Tilden did not value marriage. Indeed, he had an indissoluble bond with tennis throughout his life.</p>
<p>William T. Tilden 2nd was born on February 10, 1893, in Germanion, Pa, USA. He is about six feet two inches tall and weighs about one hundred and sixty pounds. He began practicing tennis at the age of six and won a boy's medal at the age of seven. It is said to be Tilden's first victory.</p>
<p>Tilden's youth coincided with the flourishing period of lawn tennis in the United States. Influenced by what he saw and heard, coupled with Tilden's special talent, he devoted himself to research, and his tennis skills improved rapidly. In 1918, he reached the final of the U.S. Championships for the first time, and in 1919 he again reached the final, but lost to Johnston. From 1920, he jumped to the U.S. Championships and also won the British Wimbledon Championship, taking the lead in the world. From then on, Tilden's fame shook the world. The following year, he won the Wimbledon Championship for the second time, and from 1922 to 1927 he won the U.S. Championships for six years.</p>
<p>Tilden ranked first in the U.S. Tennis Top Ten for more than ten years (1921-1930) and represented the U.S. in the Davis Cup competition for eleven years (1920-1930). This is a record unmatched by tennis players from other countries. Tilden is known as the eccentric of the tennis world, which is truly fitting. From 1920 to 1926, the United States won the Davis Cup for seven consecutive years, which cannot but be attributed to Tilden, who served as both singles and doubles player and captain. During these years, Tilden maintained the prestige of a winning army and was never defeated by any player. This is even rarer in the tennis world.</p>
<p>Since 1927, the French tennis comets Lacoste and Cochet appeared, and Tilden began to be defeated by these two players. At the same time, the United States also lost the Davis Cup. At that time, Tilden's sharp edge seemed to have withered. According to the usual practice of athletes, Tilden could have put down his butcher knife and let the talented take over, but he did not do so, and instead devoted himself to research even more diligently. At the same time, he began to write tennis books to benefit future generations.</p>
<p>One month before the U.S. and French Davis Cup players were to compete in Paris, Tilden participated in the Wimbledon competition in London (that year Tilden lost to Cochet in the semi-finals). Tilden wrote about the first two weeks of the Wimbledon competition and submitted it to a newspaper in San Francisco for publication. The United States Lawn Tennis Association believed that Tilden's writing about his own participation in the competition was a violation of the amateur sports rules and investigated it several times, resolutely deciding to revoke Tilden's amateur status. Tilden was also the captain of the U.S. Davis Cup team that year, and the association did not allow Tilden to participate in the Davis Cup final. At that time, it caused a sensation around the world and became the first major event in the history of tennis. However, the French tennis community did not take pride in the fact that the opponent in the Davis Cup final had lost its main player and gained the advantage of winning the championship, but resolutely protested to the United States Tennis Association, believing that Tilden did not intentionally violate the amateur rules and should be forgiven. It was also said that the tennis audience across France did not want to lose the opportunity to see the skills of the world's greatest tennis player. This is how countries around the world value sportsmanship and amateur rules. Although Tilden regained his qualifications that year, it gave Tilden the confidence to enter the professional tennis world.</p>
<p>In order to complete the final glory of his life, Tilden took a strong step into the world of professional tennis. He stepped up his practice, tirelessly throughout the year. Sure enough, after completing his third Wimbledon World Championship in 1930, he formally announced his entry into the professional tennis world.</p>
<p>Since joining the professional world, his skills have improved and not declined, and he has traveled to the United States and other countries to compete, which is very hard, but he is full of interest and does not take it to heart. Since recruiting the young tennis player Vines in 1933, the two of them have been an invincible team, truly unmatched in the world. Cochet, the French champion who had repeatedly defeated Tilden before, felt silent and invisible after entering the professional world, far less popular than Tilden and Vines.</p>
<p>In addition to working hard on the court, Tilden also worked hard on writing. He has written more than ten tennis books in his life, and they have all been translated into various languages, truly becoming bestsellers for a time.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Miscellaneous Grain Industry and Municipal Chamber of Commerce Agreed on Certification, Measures for Domestic Circulation of Grain, Decided to Implement Immediately After Printing Forms and Certificates <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency said that Gu Xinyi, chairman of the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association, has agreed with Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, on the measures for the domestic circulation of national rice, which are certified by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. It is stipulated that all Shanghai miscellaneous grain merchants report to the Industry Association when purchasing rice and grain from the mainland to Shanghai, and when shipping rice and grain from Shanghai to various places. After verification that it is true and there is no private export, the Industry Association requests the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to issue a certificate allowing domestic circulation. The above-mentioned certificates and application forms have been printed by the Industry Association and will be implemented immediately after printing. As for the temporary measures for domestic circulation in Shanghai submitted by the Social Affairs Bureau to the Municipal Government, they do not conflict with the above-mentioned certification measures.</p>
<p>Rice Boats Waiting to be Released. As for the rice boats shipped to Shanghai detained in Jiaxing and Jiashan in Pingyuan, Zhejiang, the rice industry groups in Pinghu and Jiashan have requested the county government to release them after signing a guarantee. However, the rice boats detained in Jiaxing must be released after the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce provides a certificate. Today, the rice boats shipped to Shanghai will definitely not be privately exported, so the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has agreed to issue certificates. However, although the Jiangsu prohibition of grain export measures have been passed, they have not been formally implemented. Shanghai is considered to be outside the territory, so the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association has requested the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to request Jiangsu Province again not to discriminate against Shanghai and to follow the Zhejiang certification measures in the future.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Export. Regarding the prohibition of grain export, the Shanghai Municipal Government has submitted it to the Central Government for approval. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance invited the Ministry of Industry and the Central Trust Bureau to hold a meeting and handed it over to the Customs Administration to draft measures. Now, Zheng Lai, Director of the Customs Administration, has been ordered by the Ministry to draft measures to prohibit grain export and to investigate the location of grain transportation in detail in order to serve as a reference for drafting measures. According to a leader of the Miscellaneous Grain Industry, the prohibition of grain export is indeed needed in fact, so it is imperative.</p>
<p>Shanghai Rice Prices Fall. After the release of the rice boats shipped to Shanghai that were detained in Jiashan and Pinghu in Zhejiang, the rice boats shipped to Shanghai from various places in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces arrived in Shanghai one after another, and the total amount of rice stored in Shanghai was about 300,000 bags, so the price of rice in Shanghai has fallen again. The real first-class rice has fallen to 11 yuan. There are rumors that about 2,000 bags of rice are shipped from Shanghai to Dalian and the three northeastern provinces every day. According to the news from the Miscellaneous Grain Industry, it is absolutely inaccurate. Moreover, the member rice shops of the association have automatically refused to accept the purchase of foreign merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e111">No More American Ships Will Come to China After the 11th Due to the Impact of the American Sailors' General Strike <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Dalai Foreign Company has 19 world-class postal ships operating in the Pacific Ocean and traveling to China. Since the American general strike broke out, the ships that have sailed from the United States to the Far East have been affected. According to a telegram received yesterday, the President Wilson sailed from New York and was still on October 25, before the strike broke out. By the time the ship arrived in Los Angeles on the 2nd of this month, the ship was also prevented from sailing by the strike committee and joined the vortex. The goods inside the ship have been blocked, and passengers can only transfer to non-American ships to come to China. On the Seattle route, the Dalai Foreign Company received a telegram yesterday that only one ship, the President McKinley, was not affected due to the strike because it was already on the Pacific Ocean. The ship is expected to arrive in Japan today, pass Kobe on the 8th, and arrive in Shanghai on the 10th. After the ship arrives in Shanghai, no American ships will sail in the Pacific Ocean. The Grand President, which was scheduled to sail to Shanghai on the next shift, has already gone on strike.</p>
<p>The ships in the Far East that have not been affected by the strike, such as the President Jackson, have already decided to change the route to Victoria, Canada, from today onwards, as the final port, in order to maintain the Sino-American route and protect the traffic on the Pacific line. All goods shipped to the United States and passengers going to the United States will be loaded and unloaded at that port, and then transferred by train to the United States, so as to avoid the American port terminals.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Commercial Registration Law: The Chamber of Commerce Urges Review <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of this city, in order to expedite the review of the Commercial Registration Law, submitted a petition to the Legislative Yuan yesterday, stating that the Commercial Registration Law was previously reviewed by a joint meeting of the Commercial Law and Civil Law Committees of your esteemed Yuan on October 31, the 23rd year of the Republic. Our association appointed Li Kuian as a representative to attend. The meeting resulted in the original drafting committee member, Huang Youchang, summarizing the opinions of all parties and revising the draft before submitting it to the two committees for review. Almost two years have passed, and approval has not yet been granted. Our association again, last month, appointed the original representative, Li Kuian, to submit a petition to your esteemed Yuan, urging that a meeting be convened quickly. A reply was received, instructing Huang Youchang to make contact, etc. Li, the representative, went to Beijing on the first of this month and contacted Huang. According to Huang, the draft has been revised and submitted to the Commercial Law and Civil Law Committees, etc. The Commercial Registration Law was originally drafted to remedy Article 681 of the Civil Code. Article 681 of the Civil Code stipulates joint and several liability for partnerships. Disputes arising from this provision are numerous and unbearable, causing good people to be unwilling to invest more and cunning people to use it as a shield. This situation, we believe, has long been within the purview of your esteemed Yuan, hence the separate drafting of the Commercial Registration Law as a remedy. Now, its invisible stagnation is likely not your esteemed Yuan's original intention. It is appropriate to submit another petition to your esteemed Yuan for review, earnestly requesting that you promptly urge the two committees to convene a meeting for review at a set time and allow our association to send representatives to attend, as this is extremely important. Respectfully, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce.</p>

<h3 id="e117">One Year of the New Currency Law: Achievements: Stable Exchange Rates, Solid International Credit, Relaxed Market, and Optimistic Prospects for the Recovery of Various Industries <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>According to the New News Agency, our country's New Currency Law was promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Finance on November 4th of last year. November 4th of this year marks its first anniversary. In this year, our country's financial situation has made great progress, and the national economy is gradually recovering. The prospects are quite optimistic. The New News Agency reporter reports on various situations as follows:</p>
<p>(Stable Exchange Rates) Although the New Currency Law has only been implemented for one year, the results achieved in various aspects are already quite impressive. In terms of financial construction, in addition to the centralized issuance and consolidation of currency, the most significant achievement is the stabilization of exchange rates and the consolidation of international credit. To ensure the stability of exchange rates, the Ministry of Finance increased foreign exchange reserves, stabilized exchange rates, and ordered the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China to restrict the trading of foreign exchange, using the financial strength of the state to establish a foundation for foreign exchange. As a result, the market price of our country's foreign exchange has been able to consistently stand at around one shilling and two and a half pence, and the center of gravity has shifted towards us.</p>
<p>(Market Recovery) In order to rescue the market, the Ministry of Finance ordered various banks to increase the amount of loans, regulate rural credit, implement a low-interest rate policy, and issue 146 million yuan in unified government bonds to repay domestic government bonds, treasury bills, and certificates issued by the government over the years. It also issued 34 million yuan in reconstruction government bonds to complete the legal tender policy, improve financial organization, and support production and construction. At the same time, it ordered the Shanghai silver industry to study methods to reduce interest rates. As a result, market interest rates have been slightly lower on average than in previous years. In addition, the urgency of the Spring Festival, the Dragon Boat Festival at the end of April, and the recent financial season at the end of October in the Shanghai market this year has been much more relaxed than a year ago, and the Shanghai interbank lending rate has remained unusually stable, and various industries are gradually recovering.</p>

However, at the beginning of the change of the route, only two flights will be operated per week on Mondays and Wednesdays. As for the original Guanglong line, it has long been extended to Hanoi, from Guangzhou via Wuzhou, Yongning, and Longzhou to Hanoi, now renamed the Guanghe line, to match the name with the reality. The weekly flights are Fridays westwards and Saturdays eastwards. The change of the air route will be implemented from November 4th, etc. Accordingly, a notice is hereby issued for general information. This is the announcement, Director Zha Peilin.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Li Jiyuan, editor-in-chief of the Min Xing Daily in Peru, South America, returned to China aboard the President Lincoln yesterday morning, arriving in Shanghai. A reporter visited him and inquired about the current situation of overseas Chinese. According to him, Peru was the first country in the Americas to trade with China. In the past, there were tens of thousands of overseas Chinese, but now there are about 10,000, of which more than 2,000 are members of the Kuomintang. The overseas Chinese in that area are more knowledgeable than the locals, and they are all engaged in commerce. In recent years, the economic situation has been better than in the past. However, education is not very developed, and some children do not even know Cantonese, let alone the written language of the motherland. In the past, Mr. Chen Lifu encouraged the establishment of schools and promised to donate books. Now, three schools have been established, and the situation has greatly changed. Overseas Chinese in North and South America are extremely excited about the unification of the country. When Yu Hanmou's telegram arrived, they cheered wildly, especially expressing their great love and admiration for President Chiang Kai-shek for his hard work and great achievements. Overseas Chinese have always been bullied by foreigners, and now they are very happy to see their motherland striving to make progress.</p>

<p>The export of lace products in this city exceeds several hundred thousand yuan annually, and no less than several thousand men and women workers rely on this for their livelihood. There has never been a guild organization. The government has always granted tax-free exports to promote domestic products and relieve workers. The industry is deeply grateful. This year marks the 50th birthday of President Chiang Kai-shek. In order to express their love for the leader, the industry, initiated by Mr. Li Changren, launched a one-day donation campaign as advocated by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, raising a total of 858 yuan and 2 cents, which, together with the remaining 197 yuan, 2 jiao, and 4 fen from the wartime national disaster donations, were all handed over to the Aircraft Purchase Commemoration Association.

<h3 id="e130">Pu River Launches Towing Ships: Changed to Two-Row Navigation: Harbor Master and Inland River Ship Association: Purely for Navigation Safety <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Harbor Master Tebeck of the Jianghai Customs, in order to maintain the safety of ships sailing on the Pu River, has specially stipulated that vessels towed by tugboats should change from a single row to a double row, which was promulgated in Announcement No. 15 last month. The Inland River Ship Industry Association of this city believes that towing according to the old rules has been practiced for a long time and has not caused any danger. Now that various ship bureaus find the new method difficult, they specially sent a letter to the Customs on the 24th of last month, requesting permission to continue towing in a single row. The association received a reply from Harbor Master Tebeck No. 27083 yesterday, stating that according to the request of Yuantong Steamship Company and others, if the barges are towed according to the regulations in Article 3 of Announcement No. 15 of this office, it would be inconvenient and dangerous for navigation. It should be requested that the reply be forwarded for approval of amendment. Upon investigation, the reasons for opposition stated in the letter are not approved by this office. Regarding the first point, "Tugboats and barges are attacked by the current from three sides as soon as they exit the Suzhou Creek." Tugboats are only subject to the impact of the current from one side of the rising or falling tide at any time they exit the Suzhou Creek, and there is no situation of being attacked from three sides. Therefore, if the tugboat gradually advances against the current, changing the tow from a single row to a double row will not cause difficulties. Regarding the second point, "The size and height of the barges are different," the shape and size of the barges are completely unrelated to the arrangement of the tugs. It is only necessary to separate the middle of the barges towed in parallel with guard rails to avoid accidents. Moreover, the method of towing barges side by side is not unique to this port. It is common practice in various ports in the country and around the world. For example, large and small iron barges in this port tow garbage ships or fishing boats, often in three rows, with three or four boats towed in each row. This is seen every day, and there has been no difficulty. As for the third point, "There are many other ships in the Suzhou Creek," this is irrelevant to whether the tugboats are in a single or double row. In short, changing the barges from a single row to a double row is only somewhat inconvenient in terms of procedure, but there is no danger to the barges being towed. Moreover, the Bund Park corner is an extremely dangerous area in this port where ships are particularly crowded. It seems that this fundamental issue should be weighed against the above-mentioned inconvenient procedures. When this office planned the change, it carefully considered that the danger of navigation in the port is purely due to the excessive length of the barges. To protect the safety of ships, two methods were originally planned: one is to reduce the number of barges to shorten their length, and the other is to change the barges to a double row. The second method can make it unnecessary to reduce the number of barges and will not affect the business of various inland river ships. Therefore, it was decided to adopt and implement it. If the members of your association wish to follow the first method, that is, to tow a total of three vessels in a row, that is also possible. It should be known that the change in the method of towing by small barges is purely for safety considerations by this office. In the past twenty years, the situation in this port has changed, and the number of ships entering and leaving has increased day by day. The old regulations must be improved appropriately. I hope that your association, which is enthusiastic about public welfare, will assist in this matter. This reply is hereby made for your information.</p>

<p>The China Women's Production Cooperative believes that time flies, and Christmas is just around the corner. In order to facilitate people from all walks of life to purchase gifts for relatives and friends in distant places, it will hold an exhibition sale for one week starting next Monday (the 9th), and Monday will be designated as Embroidery Day, Tuesday as Hardware Day, Wednesday as Velvet Fabrics Day, Thursday as Greeting Card and Painting Day, Friday as Children's Toy Day, and Saturday as General Merchandise Day.

Furthermore, the cooperative aims to promote economic independence for women and to promote the cooperative movement. Women in this city who have exquisite products or unwanted clothing, etc., can send them to Ms. Hu Ying at the China Women's Production Cooperative at 205 Yuanmingyuan Road for registration so that they can be sold on consignment. It is also heard that all operating income from this event, after deducting expenses, will be donated to public welfare.</p>

<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau recently instructed all levels of schools in the city, stating that the Dean of the Private Tongde Medical College, Gu Yuqi, reported that in view of the importance of public health and the urgent need to promote tuberculosis prevention, the college decided to conduct tuberculosis prevention X-ray examinations. To popularize the examinations, a handling fee of only one yuan was charged per person per examination; for middle school students, the fee was only eight jiao per examination, and for primary school students, the fee was six jiao. From September 1st to the end of September, a total of 428 people came to the college for examinations, including 96 students. Among them, eight students had been cured of lung disease, and seventeen were in the early stages, accounting for approximately 20% of the students. This phenomenon among a small number of students is truly alarming. The college originally focused on the examination of school students and faculty. Now that the number of students is small, and none of the faculty members have been examined, it is necessary to actively promote this work. It is requested that the Bureau issue another order to all levels of schools in the city to uniformly implement the examination to emphasize public health and prevent disease. The details of the examination have been compiled into a table and submitted for review and record. This is in the public interest. Two copies of the form are attached. Based on this, the college had previously requested the former Municipal Education Bureau to order all levels of schools to implement X-ray examinations of students' lungs. Now, based on the previous situation, it is urgently requested that the schools strictly comply with the order. This order is issued by Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Bureau.</p>

<p>Qian Jinchun, a Jiangbei sand boat carrying 500 heads of cabbage, came to Songjiang for sale. When it arrived near the Shigeng area of Wusongkou, another boat named Xue Kui, also carrying 300 heads of cabbage, came to Songjiang. The two vegetable boats were sailing side by side and entering the port at the same time when a tugboat named Ying Wan, owned by the Japanese Sanlin Transportation Company, towing a barge, came from the Yangtze River to Shanghai. When it arrived at Shigeng, it moved forward between the two vegetable boats. Due to carelessness, it crashed into the bow of the Xue Kui boat, causing significant damage. Then, it crashed into the stern of the Qian Jinchun boat. This occurred at 9:30 PM on the 4th. After the two vegetable boats were hit, they were about to sink. Fortunately, other cargo ships nearby helped them to the shallows. Yesterday morning, they hired a small tugboat to tow them to Wusong to report the incident. The incident was reported to the tax firm Xujinji and the pig industry customs clearance office, who submitted a report to Zhang Hua, the Haiguan Hebo Division, requesting the tax authorities to negotiate compensation with the transportation company.

<h3 id="e136">53 Fashion Shops' Workers Went on Strike Yesterday Morning; Employers and Foremen Reduced Wages; Workers' Representatives Petitioned Yesterday <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Dagong News reported that all fashion workers went on strike on October 17, 1933, due to a wage dispute. Subsequently, employers and the Garment Workers' Union signed six labor-management agreements. The wage section stipulated that the price for each coat was three yuan, the price for skirts (straight hem, uniformly called) was two yuan and twenty cents, the price for raincoats was one yuan, the price for capes was two yuan and twenty cents, the price for leather coats was three yuan, and the price for petticoats was thirty cents (extra for colored ones). The agreements were filed with the Party and government authorities, and the labor dispute was resolved. However, the wage agreement stipulated that the price for each coat was three yuan, with the worker receiving two yuan and sixty cents, and the foreman receiving forty cents. Unexpectedly, at the beginning of the autumn business season this year, the foremen paid the workers only one yuan and sixty or seventy cents per piece, with the foremen taking the difference. The employers also took the opportunity to reduce wages, and the fashion shops followed suit, unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the labor-management agreement.</p>
<p>Full strike</p>
<p>After the employers and foremen reduced wages, the union reported the situation to the Municipal Party Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting mediation. The Social Affairs Bureau summoned both labor and management representatives to the Bureau for mediation on September 29th and October 30th. The first time, the representatives of the Western Clothing Industry Association attended on behalf of the employers, but no results were achieved. The second time, they refused to attend, making mediation impossible. This caused widespread dissatisfaction, and suddenly, yesterday morning, all 700 workers from 53 fashion shops in the area of Fourth Avenue and Daxin Street, including Dahua, Huamei, Taixing, Datong, Zhongxing, Dachina, New China, Limei, Daxin, and Huaxin, went on strike.</p>
<p>Workers Petition</p>
<p>After all the workers went on strike, at 9:00 AM, they sent representatives Xu Guizhen, Chai Liangfa, Su Changjin, Zhang Yong'an, and Wang Xunqi, together with more than 50 worker representatives from 53 fashion shops, to petition various agencies such as the Municipal Party Committee, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the General Labor Union. Lu Yinchu, Wang Xianqing, and Wan Banghe received them separately. After the representatives explained the meaning of the petition, the Party and government representatives summoned both labor and management representatives to conduct mediation, hoping that the representatives would persuade the workers to wait for a legal solution to avoid expanding the dispute. The representatives were satisfied and returned.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Case of Counterfeiting Hubei Subsidiary Coin Notes; Court of Appeals Rendered a Verdict; Initial Trial Sentenced to Five Years; Yesterday's Appeal Sentenced to Eight Years <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Lu Fangzheng, a doctor from Hubei, was found to have counterfeited the Hubei Provincial Bank's letter of authorization. Liu Peiqing, the owner of a carving company at No. 20, Lane 153, Baige Road, carved 100,000 five-jiao subsidiary coin notes of the Hubei Provincial Bank. After the case was discovered, the Xinzha police arrested Lu and handed him over to the First Special District Court. After interrogation, Lu Fangzheng was sentenced to five years in prison. The police, believing that this kind of counterfeiting disrupted the financial system and that the crime was serious, and that the initial trial's sentence of only five years was insufficient to deter others, had their lawyer, Tian Yin, appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. After the interrogation was completed, yesterday afternoon, Chief Justice Yu Hua, together with Justices Hua and Zhou, announced the verdict: the original verdict was revoked, and Lu Fangzheng was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment for the intention to supply counterfeit currency for use. The 100,000 counterfeit Hubei Provincial Bank notes, a set of samples, eight engraving plates, two engraving molds, a contract, a copy of the certification, and the counterfeit letters and seals were all confiscated.</p>

<p>The China Animal Protection Society yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, stating: "We hereby write to inform you that, according to a letter from the China Justice Society, it is requested that the authorities of the Chinese Concession specifically address the abuse of animals (omitted). It is also requested that a letter be sent to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for strict investigation and punishment, which would be greatly appreciated." Based on this, the slaughter of ploughing cattle has always been prohibited, and the cruel killing of dairy cows is even more inhumane. Unscrupulous individuals have violated the ban, colluding with cattle dealers from the interior, smuggling ploughing cattle into the concession for slaughter and consumption for profit. If this is true, it is illegal. In accordance with the aforementioned request, in addition to sending a separate letter to the Municipal Council requesting strict prohibition, we hereby write to request that you investigate and strictly prohibit such activities within your jurisdiction to protect animal life and curb cruelty. We also request a reply. Sincerely, Ye Gongchuo and Guan Gangzhi, Chairpersons of the China Animal Protection Society.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Japanese Residents Plan to Issue Lottery Tickets <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun, the Shanghai Japanese Charity Association has already held its inaugural general meeting and should raise more than 200 yuan in membership fees each month to actively support the operation of Yishu An. Some influential Japanese residents advocate raising additional funds, namely, issuing 4,000 construction lottery tickets each month. From the proceeds of these lottery tickets, 2,000 yuan will be used to subsidize Yishu An and other charitable expenses, and the remaining 2,000 yuan will be distributed through a lottery. It is said that Japanese residents in this city purchase approximately 4,000 yuan worth of Chinese aviation lottery tickets each month. These 4,000 yuan are entirely invested in the construction of the National Government and do not benefit the Japanese in any way. If these lottery tickets are limited to Japanese residents, it can reduce the number of Chinese aviation lottery tickets purchased by Japanese residents, and also reduce the expenses for horse racing and dog racing. The construction of Japanese primary schools in Hong Kong and the facilities in the Japanese Concession in Tianjin have adopted this method. It is now planned to submit the purpose, objectives, and methods to the Consulate General for approval. (Translator's note: It is often heard that Japanese people win prizes in our country's aviation construction lottery tickets. Murakami Law Office of the East Asia Bank, and lawyer Okamoto entrusted their English clerk Chen Yun to buy five aviation construction lottery tickets in the sixth phase, and won the first prize. Later, Chen shared several thousand yuan. Other winners have also been reported.)</p>

<p>Since its issuance, the National Government's Aviation and Highway Construction Lottery Ticket has been welcomed by all sectors of society due to its outstanding credibility and widespread prizes. The 28th phase is scheduled to be drawn in public at the Yiyuan in the French Concession at 2:00 PM on the 6th of this month. All lottery procedures have been prepared by the Aviation Lottery Ticket Office. All sectors of society are welcome to attend and observe. All winning tickets will be paid out by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications starting from the 14th of this month. In addition, the Office has specially contracted with various radio stations to broadcast the winning numbers in Chinese, English, French, and Russian during the lottery. Those with radio receivers can listen at any time, which is very convenient. The broadcasting frequencies of each radio station are listed below: Overseas Chinese XMHC (700 kilocycles), Foyin XMHB (980 kilocycles), Huale XMHA (600 kilocycles), Qikai XQHB (820 kilocycles), Jianhua XHHB (740 kilocycles).</p>

<p>The Public Concession Police Department has been using two armored cars for ten years, which have been quite effective in suppressing riots in the concession. Two new cars will be replaced within a few weeks. The equipment in the new cars will be better, and the speed will also be increased. Each car can carry 40 reserve police officers in addition to the driver, and is also equipped with a small car that can accommodate 25 people. It is also equipped with a wireless telephone, which can communicate with the General Patrol Room at any time. The new cars have six wheels instead of four, and look very grand. Driving is more convenient than the old cars. The manufacturing cost is not expensive. The cars are equipped with a six-cylinder engine. In addition to the police bell, the cars can also emit a loud whistle sound. In addition to the tear gas equipment, there is also a tear gas cannon that can fire shells very far, and a small machine gun. In addition, the cars are equipped with bombs that emit foul odors, steel jackets, steel shields, ladder ropes, axes, and other items. The two cars will patrol the east and west districts in rotation every day. With these powerful weapons, the reckless rioters will not dare to act rashly.</p>

It was resolved at the river work preparation meeting on the 22nd of this month that the government should issue a notice prohibiting planting. Based on this, in addition to the instructions, this announcement is issued. All farmers and tenants along the south bank of the river should abide by this announcement.</p>

<p>The Baoshan Branch of the World Red Swastika Society was originally established after the January 28 Incident. Because it was established hastily at that time, it rented a house on Baochang Road for emergency use. This spring, it purchased a piece of vacant land at the intersection of Tiantong'an Road and Baotong Road, and began planning to build a new building for permanent use. After more than two months of construction, all the work was completed last month, and the completion ceremony was held yesterday. Invitations were widely extended to branches from all over the world to send representatives to attend the ceremony. Therefore, many representatives from various branches attended the event yesterday. Li Sihao, the current Chairman of the Economic Commission of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, and more than 200 members of the Shanghai Branch also attended. Hu Huayi, the manager of Ningbo Lu Huichang Bank, the chairman of the branch, personally received them. The ceremony was held at noon, dinner was held at 1:00 PM, a photo session was held at 2:30 PM, and a meeting was held at 3:00 PM before dispersing.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Headless Corpse in a Box Case; All Three Defendants Found Not Guilty; No Conclusive Evidence Found After Extensive Investigation; Judge Hopes for Appeal and Discovery of New Evidence <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Since the case of the headless corpse in a box occurred, Huang Fusen and Liu Zhaonian, detectives of the Hongkou Police Department, arrested Lin Gendi, a Ningbo waitress at No. 22 Xian Shi Amusement Park, Mao Agen, a Shaoxing driver at No. 650 Xinzha Fire Brigade, and Jiang Yuantan, a Fujian firefighter at No. 231 Central Fire Brigade. They were handed over to the First Special District Court, which conducted repeated interrogations. Lin Gendi insisted that she, Mao, and Jiang killed Cai Ying, a No. 1 waitress at Daxin Company, in a pavilion room at No. 3 Cunfu Lane, Bapaoluo Road, on August 5th. Although Jiang Yuantan had once admitted it, he later retracted his confession. Mao Agen simply denied it. Although the trial judge Zhong Qing and Mao Agen's lawyer Fan Gang tried their best to investigate, they could not obtain conclusive evidence on the following points: (1) Whether there was a person named Cai Ying at No. 3 Cunfu Lane; (2) Whether there was a waitress named Cai Ying at Daxin Company; (3) Whether Cai Ying, whom Lin Gendi confessed to killing, was the corpse in the box. Lawyer Fan had gone to various places to investigate the above points, but to no avail, making the case</p>
<p>Mysterious and Unpredictable. On the 20th of last month, Judge Zhong, having exhausted his investigative abilities, ordered the debate and declared the conclusion of the case, setting a time for the verdict. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Police Lawyer Zhang Zhizhu and Mao Agen's Lawyer Fan Gang were in court waiting for the verdict. At about 5:00 PM, Judge Zhong Qing and Prosecutor Zhang Zongru took their seats in the third criminal court and announced the verdict. The main text of the verdict stated that Lin Gendi, Mao Agen, and Jiang Yuantan were all not guilty, and also announced</p>
<p>The reason for the verdict, which stated in brief that, according to the witness's testimony, Lin, the president of the company, Lin Gendi told someone at the intersection of Carter Road that after killing Cai Ying, she cut off both hands. However, Lin also stated during the court hearing that both hands were cut off. But the discovered corpse, according to the autopsy results, did not have both hands cut off. Thus, Lin's confession was obviously inconsistent with the facts, and there were many doubts in the case, making it difficult to make a guilty verdict. However, this case</p>
<p>Involves serious circumstances. It is hoped that the police will appeal. At the appeal hearing, or new evidence may be discovered, and a fair and appropriate judgment may be obtained. Police Lawyer Zhang immediately expressed his willingness to consider it, but requested that the defendants be remanded in custody during the appeal period. Lawyer Fan Gang requested that Mao be allowed to be released on bail. Judge Zhong stated that the case was serious and that bail could not be granted before a final verdict was made. Therefore, he ordered that Lin, Mao, and Jiang be remanded in custody during the appeal period.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Xu Wancheng Accuses Luo Tong, etc., to the Jiangsu High Court <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Xu Wancheng, an editor at the Shanghai News Bookstore, was detained for a long time for commenting on a case in the Shanghai Local Court. Xu accused the judicial administrative department, and the judicial administrative department approved the accusation to the Jiangsu High Court. Xu's case has now attracted the attention of society. The original text of the accusation to the Jiangsu High Court is copied below: "Submitting an accusation that the former President of the Shanghai Local Court, Luo Tong, and Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu, and Judge Lu Hongze, have acted with disdain for the law, abused their authority, and illegally detained me for nearly two and a half months, causing me to suffer greatly, and requesting</p>
<p>Investigation according to law to safeguard national law." The Judicial Administration Department approved the accusation to the court in Document No. 2964. "I graduated from Jiangsu Provincial Second Normal School (formerly Longmen Normal School, now renamed Shanghai Provincial High School) and Datong University, majoring in education. I have always advocated that the education sector must set an example, and the judicial sector must rectify itself. I deeply admire Chairman Chiang's efforts to clean up officialdom. I deeply feel that China's foreign troubles are urgent because of the failure to repair internal affairs. To repair internal affairs, we must first clean up officialdom, and then the country can be governed. Looking around the domestic situation, I feel sad. Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, and the eyes of the world are on us. The national system depends on this. The former President of the Shanghai Local Court, Luo Tong, has been in office for less than a year, and there have been</p>
<p>Many Things to Criticize. For example, the stolen (?) pistol has been a laughing stock among friendly nations. If the Public Security Bureau and the police station themselves have theft, what will the public opinion of the people be like? Article 130 of the Criminal Law states that 'Public officials who neglect their duties and cause disasters shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than three years but not more than ten years.' If the court can have a stolen pistol, is it not a dereliction of duty? Spreading this new type of pistol into society will cause many crimes. Is this not causing disaster? I heard that Luo Tong is about to be transferred to the Hubei Higher Branch Court. If so, is the national legislation only for the common people? I do not want to say it, and I cannot bear to say it. Since Luo Tong has been the President of the Court, there have been cases of prosecutors and judges being bribed and reported and punished. I will not discuss others, but even just the ones that have been discovered are heartbreaking. In short, during Luo Tong's</p>
<p>Presidency, the Shanghai citizens were angry and dared not speak out. I am honest and straightforward by nature, and out of righteous indignation, I wrote an article commenting on the situation. All of them are based on facts, and there are witnesses. There is no malice in what I said. The purpose is to promote the judiciary. I did not expect to offend the anger of these people, who considered it an insult and slander. The President ordered Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu to open a second court investigation on the afternoon of June 8th of this year. I was summoned and arrived, but was still detained. On the morning of the 13th of the same month, the trial judge Lu Hongze's attitude was irritable and biased. He made it clear that he was prejudiced. I was unwilling to give a confession and requested a change of jurisdiction and bail. The judge verbally stated that bail would not be granted, fearing that if I were released on bail, I would</p>
<p>Continue to commit crimes. The judge had not inquired about the case in detail, but had already determined that the defendant was guilty. This is extremely absurd. I was detained for nearly two and a half months. In the small room of the detention center, there were more than ten people imprisoned. It was summer, the heat was unbearable, and the bedbugs and white worms were swarming day and night. The environment was terrible. I</p>
<p>Was Seriously Ill. I reported it for treatment, but it was ignored. Judge Lu Hongze did not allow bail. In his ruling, he falsely accused my illness of being fabricated, which is especially hateful. Furthermore, hot water was not always provided in the detention center. My family was often prevented from delivering necessary items and food, and all kinds of abuses were inflicted on me. If I were to describe them one by one, I could not exhaust them in ten million words. I am devoted to education and cultural undertakings. After being detained, everything was left unattended. I was anxious to die, and was forced by internal and external pressures.</p>
<p>Every Day Felt Like a Year. This kind of suffering cannot be described in words. Fortunately, President Lu Xinhuai was magnanimous and personally investigated and discovered that I was seriously ill, with my feet rotting and my face swollen. I was dying. He ordered me to be sent to the hospital for treatment, which can be verified. My body has not yet recovered from the illness. I have been stimulated too deeply, and both eyes have become incurable. I am still alive, which is fortunate. Later, I appealed to the court, and the order was given to make a new legal ruling. However, the judge delayed it for many days. I had no choice but to appeal to the new President again for relief, and I was granted bail. However, all kinds of difficulties were added during the bail process. In short, the previous situation of this case, after reading the case file, about my thesis and confession, and the prosecutor's indictment, and the judge's</p>
<p>Ruling Not to Grant Bail, and newspaper reports, etc., can prove whether there was abuse of power and illegal detention. The Wuxian District Court has now concluded the case, and the case is clear. At most, it is a fine of 30 yuan and a suspended sentence of two years. In such a minor case, I was detained from 2:30 PM on June 8th to 11:15 AM on August 22nd, a total of 72 days, 21 hours, and 15 minutes. May I ask what is it if it is not acting with disregard for the law, abusing power, and detaining illegally? Former President Luo Tong, Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu, and Judge Lu Hongze have violated Articles 125, Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. If they are not severely punished, it is feared that others will follow suit. The authority and integrity of the judiciary should start from itself. The credibility of the Shanghai Local Court in the past</p>
<p>Had Long Been Lost. Instead of rectifying the situation, they want to silence the people and detain me on false pretenses. (In his reply to Shi Jun of the National Government, Luo Tong expressed his hatred for me in writing, which can be used as evidence.) This further shows their baseness. The laws and regulations of the country are collapsing. My personal loss is still small. Therefore, the judiciary itself should be strictly corrected to maintain the spirit of legislation. For the sake of the overall situation and for the sake of maintaining the national legal system, I will not be silent. Therefore, in accordance with the approval of the Judicial Administration Department, I am filing a complaint with the court, respectfully requesting investigation and legal handling. Furthermore, during this detention, former President Luo Tong and Judges Tang Ruxiu and Lu Hongze arbitrarily detained me, which was close to hostile behavior. All losses, such as medical expenses and various losses during detention, should be compensated by the three defendants to punish the unruly. I am a poor man in Jiangsu and seek relief. Your merit will be immeasurable. Sincerely, Xu Wancheng, Jiangsu High Court. Attach a copy of the Judicial Administration Department's approval and evidence.</p>

<p>Jin Guocheng (also known as Wang Jinsheng), a local resident, 49 years old, is a fishmonger residing at No. 220, Lane 162, Changping Li, You Dai Jiao. On April 11th of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, he married Wu Lude, a woman from his hometown, whom he obtained from the Jiliang Institute. She is currently 24 years old. Last September, they had a child. Recently, due to the dwindling source of fishmonger's livelihood and financial constraints, he colluded with a man named Miao Ruikui, who is currently at large, to carry out a plan to</p>
<p>arrange a "pigeon marriage." A Ningbo man named Lu Weisheng, 35 years old, residing at No. 45, Renchang Li, Qiwupu Road, works as a shop assistant at Hujiang University on Yangshupu Road and is still single. He entrusted old women from his hometown, Shen A'da and Lin A'lin, to look for a cheap village woman for him, regardless of her appearance. Miao and Jin learned of this opportunity and, through the help of a woman named Shi Wu, contacted Lu Weisheng's widowed sister-in-law, Ma. The two Ningbo women, Shen A'da and Lin A'lin, took Jin's wife to Lu's house. Little uncle Weisheng</p>
<p>found her agreeable and agreed to a betrothal gift of 120 yuan. He also met with Jin Guocheng, who claimed that his wife was his eldest daughter and that because he was old, he needed to quickly marry her off to take care of her for the rest of her life. Lu was overjoyed and chose an auspicious day, September 27th, to give the betrothal gift of 120 yuan to the matchmakers Shen A'da and Lin A'lin, who handed it over to Jin Guocheng, who accepted it and made a written receipt. Jin used the alias Wang Jinsheng, Wu changed her name to Wang Xiaomei, and they temporarily abandoned the child,</p>
<p>disguised as a bride, and took a car to Lu's house. She and Weisheng kowtowed to heaven and earth and consummated their marriage, while the groom was completely in the dark, unaware of the "pigeon marriage" scheme. On the afternoon of the 25th of last month, Jin Guocheng went to Lu Weisheng's house, pretending to visit his daughter. Lu treated him as his father-in-law, providing wine and meat for lunch. Around 2 p.m., while Lu went out shopping, Jin and his wife eloped back home, hiding in their bedroom,</p>
<p>to listen for news. Lu Weisheng returned home and found his bride missing. He searched everywhere, but to no avail. He then reported the situation to the Yulin Road Patrol House. Hua Detective Liu Zhisheng arrested Jin at a tiger stove on Changping Road at 7 a.m. the day before yesterday and also found Wu at his home. Both were taken back to the patrol house,</p>
<p>detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. A lawyer from the Bureau of Public Works, Zhang Shizhu, explained the case and requested an investigation. The marriage certificate was presented for inspection. Subsequently, Lu Weisheng, the matchmakers Shen A'da and Lin A'lin, Lu Ma, Shi Wu, and others testified about the events. When questioned, both defendants stammered. Judge Zhong Qing ordered them to be remanded in custody pending sentencing.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Apprentice Run Over and Killed by Public Bus: Victim's Father Hires Lawyer to Sue, Demanding Severe Punishment for Driver's Disregard for Human Life <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Recently, traffic accidents involving buses in the city have been frequent, with statistics from the French Concession showing an average of over 85 cases per day, which is alarming. In the case of Zhou A'mao, an apprentice at an American fruit store, being run over and killed by a British public bus at the intersection of Haig Road and Diefeng Road on the 28th of last month, Zhou Shengcai, the father of the victim, has entrusted lawyer Wang Jian'e to file a lawsuit according to law. Yesterday, he also submitted petitions to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession, the Citizens' United Association, and the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, requesting them to negotiate with the company for compensation and to punish the driver involved in the accident. The original petition stated: "I, Zhou Shengcai, am 63 years old, from Zhenhai, residing in Dingxing Li, North Sichuan Road. My only son was tragically killed by a speeding British public bus. I implore you to seek justice. My son A'mao, 18 years old, was an apprentice at the American fruit store at No. 1253 Jing'an Temple Road. On the 28th of this month, he was delivering goods by bicycle. Around 12:15 p.m., while traveling east to west through the intersection of Haig Road and Diefeng Road, a British public bus (driven by Zheng Changyou, No. 427, from Jiangbei) sped forward without honking its horn, causing my son's bicycle to be unable to avoid it. He was knocked to the ground, and the driver, knowing that he had caused an accident, still did not brake, intending to escape punishment. It was not until the patrolman noticed (after being dragged for three yards) and ordered him to stop that he finally braked. However, my son was already under the bus, his left and right ribs were crushed, he was unconscious, and he was spitting blood. Patrolman No. 3002 and passersby lifted the bus and pulled him out, sending him to the Red Cross General Hospital, but it was too late to save him, and he died tragically. Because the accident occurred at the intersection of the French Concession and the Chinese-administered area, the French police ordered detectives to investigate the incident, and the Second Special Court verified that the death was indeed the case. My wife and I are both over sixty years old and relied on this only son for our livelihood. Now that he has been tragically killed, how can we survive? Therefore, I specially appeal to your associations to uphold justice, write to the Second Special Court to severely punish the bus driver for his disregard for human life, and write to the company to negotiate compensation so that I can barely survive. I respectfully submit this petition."</p>

<p>Wang Dongcai and others, members of the Blood Soul Extermination Group, were arrested by the patrol house and sent to the First Special Court for sentencing. However, the main culprits Zhang Zilian, Jiang Zhonghe, Wang Zixiang, Wang Jingzhi, and Ren Jinpin were all at large, and the First Special Court issued warrants for their arrest. On the 2nd of this month, after being informed, Hua Detective You A'gen and Detective Mu Lang Jintang of the Old Gate Patrol House arrested Jiang Zhonghe at the North Railway Station and handed him over to the First Special Court for detention, as reported in this newspaper. At 5:35 a.m. yesterday morning, Ren Jinpin suddenly surrendered himself to the Old Gate Patrol House with lawyer Jiang Yiping. After investigation, the detective detained him and sent him to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court at 9 a.m. Attorney Li Zhishan of the Patrol House requested permission to detain him in accordance with Articles 76 and 101 of the Criminal Procedure Law and to try him together with Jiang Zhonghe's case. He also stated that Ren denied any connection with the Blood Soul Extermination Group at the Patrol House and that he did not know the whereabouts of Zhang Zilian and others. Ren Jinpin confessed that he was 41 years old, from Yin County, Zhejiang, residing at No. 8, Lane 361, Meibaik Road, and currently works as a secretary at the fish market. His lawyer requested bail. Judge Feng Shide then ordered Ren Jinpin to be detained and to be tried together with Jiang Zhonghe on the 10th of this month.</p>

The North Sichuan Road Police Station, upon receiving the report, dispatched Police Chief Wang Wengeng to lead police officers to pursue the assailant, who had already disappeared. Police Chief Wang then found a sharp steel knife, approximately five inches long, on the ground in a small alley behind the Yueguan Restaurant nearby. Liang Fuchu, Chief of the North Station Branch, and Wang Weiming, Deputy Inspector of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, together with Mr. Tajima, Chief of the Police Department of the Japanese Consulate, each led translators and over 20 police officers to conduct a detailed investigation at the scene of the incident.

<p>In the case of Cao Hongxu suing Shen A'qing, a driver of the China Merchants Bureau, for causing injury through negligence in the First Special District Court, it was reported that the court had approved the plaintiff's request to file a criminal self-prosecution against the driver Shen A'qing alone for the crime of negligent injury in the course of business, while the car owner was only subject to a civil suit and ordered to be jointly responsible with the driver. Yesterday, inquiries at the China Merchants Bureau revealed that the car involved in the accident was a public car of the China Merchants Bureau, not a private car of General Manager Cai, and that General Manager Cai was not in the car at the time of the accident.

<p>Huang Weiru, a local resident, previously suffered from a throat ailment and sought treatment from the well-known throat specialist Zhu Ziyun. He felt that the doctor was not Zhu himself and suspected that Zhu was defrauding patients. Therefore, he filed a criminal lawsuit against Zhu for fraud. Zhu, in turn, accused Huang of false accusation and filed a counter-appeal against Huang. The First Instance Court of the First Special District Court ruled that both parties were not guilty. Huang Weiru was not satisfied with the above judgment and yesterday filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court, detailing the reasons for his dissatisfaction with the original judgment, requesting that the part of the First Instance judgment that acquitted Zhu Ziyun be overturned, that he be punished as he deserved, and that he be compensated for the losses he suffered. The case will soon be heard by the Second Branch of the High Court.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday evening, Wang Yihong, a native of Zhenjiang, was seen wandering near the 16th Pier of Nanshi Port with two boys, intending to board a certain ship. One of the children suddenly started crying, which was noticed by the on-duty police officer, who found their behavior suspicious. Upon questioning, Wang's words were hesitant, so he was taken to the 16th Pier Branch, where he was handed over to Dong Mingde, the captain of the Fifth Squad of the Detective Team. After questioning, Wang confessed that he had abducted the two boys in the past month and was planning to take them to Fujian for sale. It was learned that the two children were Yu Wandao, 6 years old, whose father was Yu Kailin, and Zhang Tonggen, 7 years old, whose father was Zhang Jinjiang. The branch then dispatched team members to investigate and summon the families of the two children to identify them, and to arrest the accomplices of the confessed child trafficker for investigation.</p>

The hospital authorities have been planning to add these departments. Recently, in view of the importance of ophthalmology and the fact that those suffering from eye diseases often cannot get complete and perfect treatment, which can have lifelong consequences, the hospital has added a specialized ophthalmology department, inviting Dr. Guo Bingkuan, a medical doctor and ophthalmology expert from the University of Vienna in Austria, to take charge of the department. He began seeing patients on the first of this month.</p>

<p>In addition to the four brands of double-coil bulbs from General Electric, Edison, Westinghouse, and Philips, there is also the double-stacked spring bulb from the China World Lamp Factory, the latest invention in the national goods electric bulb industry, which is also a fine and most suitable product. The manufacturing method uses double-stacked spring filaments and undergoes many heavy procedures, as well as careful research and thorough testing before production. In terms of functionality, it has several more varieties compared to other brands and is divided into vacuum 15, 25, 40, 50, 60 watts, and argon 40, 60, 75, 100, 150 and 200 watts, with the luminous intensity increased by 20% while the selling price remains the same at only 36 cents per piece. In this way, the effectiveness is extremely universal, and the use is more versatile. Therefore, electric commercial enterprises and municipal authorities from all over the country have been rushing to place orders in recent days, indicating that the stacked spring bulb is shining a light in the national electrical appliance industry.</p>

<p>Achievements of the Shanghai-Taicang Sanatorium: The Shanghai-Taicang Sanatorium on Hutai Road, Zhabei, Yucqing Bridge, has been conducting X-ray health checkups since July, with a total of no less than a thousand people. The achievements are remarkable. Yesterday, I visited a sick friend at the sanatorium, who said that he had suffered from a severe lung disease and had reached the second stage. He was carefully treated by the sanatorium's doctors using the latest methods. He was hospitalized for less than a month and recovered a lot of health. The sanatorium is located in a quiet place with fresh air, and the ward equipment is perfect, with attentive nursing, which is most suitable for patients to recuperate. He intends to stay for another week before being discharged and returning home. He praised the doctors and nurses of the sanatorium for their ability to do their best and was very grateful. The reporter saw that there were many hospitals in Shanghai, but few hospitals could satisfy people's wishes. Seeing other patients in the sanatorium, either resting quietly or walking around, if it were not for the name "sanatorium," one would almost suspect that this was a high-class hotel for avoiding disasters.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Embezzlement Case of Yong'an Company Furniture Department Employee Concludes Yesterday. Defendant Claims Meager Salary and Heavy Family Burden; Truly Left with No Choice but to Commit this Illegal Act <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Chen Ding'an from Ningbo and Wang Jiegui from Shanghai, etc., were employees in the furniture department of Yong'an Company on Nanjing Road. However, according to the company's regulations, when employees of various departments are busy with their duties and have no time to eat, they can obtain a signed paper from their respective department heads to claim a meal allowance of four jiao. Chen et al. exploited this system by using department heads' signed slips and fabricating pretexts to fraudulently obtain funds from the company's accounting department for their own use. On the 25th of last month, Chen Ding'an continued to use this method, writing a slip intending to fraudulently claim 135 yuan, but was discovered. The case was reported to the Laozha Police Station, which ordered detective He Renrui to arrest Chen Ding'an and Wang Jiegui, along with suspect Qing Lingen, and send them to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Ye Shengchao took his seat in the Second Criminal Court for further interrogation. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu rose and stated the case, saying that during the adjournment, the police found that Ying Lingen was not involved in the case and should be released first. However, Chen Ding'an and Wang Jiegui had repeatedly used this method to defraud the company's accounting department, and it was not a one-time occurrence. Moreover, Wang Jiegui also used his position to not sell the company's goods to customers, but instead resold woodenware from Dachang and Yuanchang in Ningbo Road to buyers, thereby harming the company's rights. He requested a strict investigation and severe punishment. The legal representative of Yong'an Company, Guo Wenhui, head of the furniture department, also hired lawyers Xu Shihao and Zuo Dejin to appear in court, filing a civil suit claiming 975 yuan from Chen Ding'an and 122.20 yuan from Wang Jiegui, requesting recovery and a joint judgment. When questioned, Chen Ding'an confessed to the charges, saying, "I have been working in the furniture department of Yong'an Company for more than ten years. My monthly salary is only about 20 yuan. I still have an elderly father and wife to support at home. This is barely enough to survive. Last year, my grandmother passed away, so I was left with no choice but to commit this illegal act. I beg for leniency on this point." When questioned, Wang Jiegui did not admit to the crime. After the lawyers for both parties debated, Judge Ye ordered that the case be adjourned until next Tuesday for the pronouncement of judgment. The two defendants were remanded in custody, and Ying Lingen was released.</p>

But the November Contract Ultimately Can't Hold <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is weakening because the rise in American cotton prices is not strong, and the price of third-grade yarn markets is rising and falling, dampening sentiment. However, the November contract has been held up by various parties, and the market price is quite firm. But the forward contracts are weakening because foreign factories are starting to loosen their grip, and cloth transactions have become sluggish. Yarn markets outside of Shanghai are stagnant, so sentiment is calm, and there are still people willing to sell when prices rise.</p>
<p>(The Shanghai Spot Market Remains the Same) The pre-market opening for spot yarn trading saw the November contract rise by 1.40 yuan due to the rise in American cotton prices, and market sentiment was firm and bullish. However, when it came to trading the forward contracts, the market turned weak, as major bullish players took advantage of the rise to suddenly release a large number of contracts, causing the market to loosen. After the second round of trading, all months declined in unison. Also, Osaka's third-grade yarn prices fell, and spot yarn transactions were not active. The closing was mediocre. As a result, all months fell by 5, 6, and 9 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price, except for the current month, which rose by 7 jiao. After the New Year's opening, the current month continued to be firm because Sichuan merchants were purchasing spot yarn, and buying sentiment was strong. However, forward contracts fell due to the poor performance of Osaka's third-grade yarn market. After the first round of trading, the near-term months remained firm, while the distant months gradually declined. However, spot yarn transactions were not very active, with only 1,200-1,300 bales traded. By the time of the closing, the decline in forward contracts was even more severe. As a result, the current month rose another 9 jiao compared to the morning's closing price, while the distant months fell by 4, 5, and 6 jiao. It was observed that Hengyi sold 1,350 bales, Taixing 1,000 bales, Gengfeng 2,200 bales, Xingchang 1,750 bales, Shenji 1,050 bales, Changfeng 6,600 bales, Runkang 2,900 bales, Yongda 600 bales, Jinchang 600 bales, and Tonghe 750 bales. Mingde bought 5,550 bales, Jifeng 650 bales, Huamao 1,500 bales, Fengtai 1,650 bales, Renfeng 1,500 bales, Xiecheng 2,600 bales, Zhenda 950 bales, and Changyu 850 bales. The price comparison between one day is as follows:</p>
<p>Contract Yarn　Highest Price　Lowest Price　Closing Price　Compared to Previous Day　Balance</p>
<p>November Contract　137.6　136.0　127.6　Up 1.60　88,400</p>
<p>December Contract　128.9　218.3　218.5　Down 0.40　27,700</p>

<p>April Contract　215.5　214.6　214.6　Down 0.90　16,550</p>
<p>Total　580,150</p>
<p>(Spot Yarn Has Outlets in Sichuan and Guangdong) Spot yarn sales are still relatively good. According to statistics, all guilds bought a total of 1,345 bales throughout the day. The selling price was similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts of each guild are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong　635　Inland　390　Jiangxi　30</p>
<p>Shantou　10　Changsha　25　Sichuan　240</p>

<p>The cotton market has fallen back, and the situation is declining. Although President Roosevelt was re-elected, the rise in cotton prices was not strong, so people's sentiment turned negative. In addition, simulated cotton from the north road is overstocked, and the source of cotton is increasing daily. Therefore, the market situation is weakening, but many parties are still inactive.</p>
<p>(Futures Cotton Has Bulk Sales) The pre-market opening for spot cotton trading saw American cotton prices rise, but market sentiment was mediocre. Because a certain gentleman came to sell in bulk again, there was a flood of chips on the market. After the second round of trading, the market tended to decline. In fact, the year's harvest was abundant, and the source of cotton from the north road was gradually increasing. There were still people willing to sell when prices rose. As a result, all months fell by 2 to 3.5 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening saw the market situation flat. The second round rose slightly by 5 fen. At the third closing, due to bad news and a surge in cotton arrivals from the north road, a wave of declines suddenly arose. As a result, all months fell by 1.5 to 2.3 jiao compared to the morning's closing price. It was observed that Changhe sold 19,700 dan, Hengyi 7,800 dan, Dafeng 4,000 dan, Daqing 1,200 dan, Dachang 1,600 dan, Juxing 3,300 dan, Ruita 5,400 dan, Renfeng 2,000 dan, Yuanxingchang 3,000 dan, and Xiecheng 1,000 dan. Dafu bought 2,400 dan, Taixing 5,000 dan, Yuda 1,300 dan, Yuanda 3,300 dan, Mingde 4,800 dan, Hexing 7,200 dan, Xingchang 2,200 dan, Yichang 2,200 dan, Changfeng 1,500 dan, Yikang 1,400 dan, and Xinxing 2,400 dan. Here is a comparison of the highest, lowest, and closing prices for one day:</p>

<h3 id="e174">Prospects for Restrictions on American Cotton Production – Cotton Prices Rise by More Than 20 Points – <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with prices rising by 8 to 27 points in each month. Initially, because Roosevelt's election was advantageous and there were prospects for restrictions on cotton production, all kinds of goods were strong, the market was firm and bullish, stock market activity was strong, Liverpool was strong, the western cotton-growing areas were cold, and private estimates were favorable to bullish players. At the same time, foreign merchants, brokers, and peers also had needs, so there was no reaction before cotton farmers sold off. Spot cotton and cloth markets were both firm and quiet. The closing was firm and stable. Spot prices rose by 17 points, and futures prices rose by 17 to 28 points. British cotton spot prices rose by 3 points, and futures prices rose by 3-4 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to the cost of living after Roosevelt's continued election, then weakened due to bullish players closing positions, and finally rose again due to large purchases by exporters. Pingguo rose by 1.25 rupees, Aomula rose by 2 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 5 rupees. Original telegram recorded left (4th telegraph).</p>

<p>A telegram from New York on the 4th stated that the Commercial Newspaper's estimate for this year's new cotton production is 11,487,000 bales. The previous estimate (October 7th) was 11,518,000 bales.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Spot Yarn Sales in Mid-October Decreased Compared to the Previous Period – Estimated at More Than 38,000 Bales <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>It was observed that the sales of spot cotton yarn in the first half of last month were quite good. Customer's buying intentions were very strong, and the market price soared. By the time it entered the last ten days of the month, the appetites of various regions seemed to be stagnant. As a result, the transaction volume in the spot market in mid-October was 38,760 bales, a decrease of 2,056 bales compared to mid-September. The reasons for the decrease are said to be that the prices are too high, which hinders actual sales, and that spot yarn supplies are depleted. Here is a breakdown of the relevant guilds:</p>
<p>The inland guild ranks first, decreasing from 10,040 bales in September to 9,400 bales. The Tianjin guild's purchases of more than 6,500 bales increased slightly. The Sichuan guild increased from more than 1,400 bales to more than 6,000 bales. Changsha increased sharply from more than 1,000 bales to more than 4,500 bales. The Guangdong guild decreased sharply from 10,040 bales to more than 1,700 bales. The purchase amounts of each guild are recorded on the left (unit: bales):</p>

<h3 id="e178">Piece Goods: Printed Flannelette Declines Sharply <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market was increasingly weak. Customers from various places were disheartened by the daily decline in cloth prices, and their appetites were sharply reduced, resulting in very stagnant actual sales. Small-scale transactions in the market were uneven because holders were vying to sell first. Printed flannelette declined the most sharply. Yesterday, the selling price dropped again (per yard) by 5 to 1 fen. The goods ordered from Qinfeng, Dacheng, Dasheng, and other factories for white twill flannelette were delivered slowly, and there were many cases of missed deadlines. The selling price was still firm, while the deliveries from Xinyu, Zhentai, Yong'an, and other factories were still active. The small amount of goods in the market were sold back by the customer guild at a price (per piece) that was more than 5-6 jiao cheaper than the market price. Because of the low prices, it was still difficult to find buyers. New transactions for plain and figured straight-grain serge and broadcloth were exceptionally quiet. Various factories still had a large number of outstanding orders, and the market price was also declining step by step. Sales of white goods, heavy and light coarse cloth, coarse twill, and fine twill were consistently reduced. The 16- and 14-pound coarse cloth for military uniforms still had some demand, but as the number of shipments from various factories gradually increased, prices gradually declined. The market situation for eastern goods, fine twill, fine cloth, and gray cloth was even more weak. Refined cloth at 15 1/2 yuan actually fell by 1 jiao and a half per piece. A telegram from Qingdao stated that fine cloth such as Shuanglong, Zhuhua, and Niaoniao brands in the Qingdao market rose by 1 jiao per piece, but the Shanghai market still showed no signs of recovery.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Thursday, was the 3,013th auction of Yuanfang Foreign Firm. On display were four types of Western goods: Jiyuan Velvet, Tribute Serge, Feather Silk, totaling 79 boxes from 50 brands. There were usually bleached cloth, red and blue broadcloth, and poplin and foreign yarn, but these were not included because no goods had arrived from overseas. The market was active with customer guilds, and transactions on this street recovered. Auction prices rose more than they fell compared to the previous period. There were 9 brands of Western satin. The Shi He Hou, San Xia, and Bing brands were priced at 1.6 fen to 8 fen per yard. The rest rose slightly with no decrease. The Wuhua Cave of Wuyong rose by 9 fen, Jiu Fang fell by 2.5 fen. San Duo Tu Tribute Serge was priced at 2 jiao. 66 brands of Yuan Feather Silk. Huazhutu rose by 1.25 yuan per piece, Cai Bashi fell by 9.2 fen, Anzhanbao rose by 8 jiao, and the rest rose or fell by 1-2 jiao, but the risers were in the majority.</p>

<p>Although pure gold prices rose in the gold market yesterday, major players found it difficult to sustain their positions and sold off one after another. In addition, foreign exchange also eased sharply due to the closing of positions by Chinese merchants, and the trend continued to decline. Initially, overseas silver markets reported that British silver rose while American silver remained stable. The distant-month silver price in Montreaux rose by 2.5 to 3.5 cents. Exchange rates fell slightly. London spot gold rose by half a penny. The central bank's official exchange rate announcement showed that British and American rates were flat, and the customs gold unit rose by 2 cents. The standard spot gold price was listed at 1,156.40 yuan. In off-market pre-market trading, the opening was slightly lower because Yuan Mao Yong, etc., sold slightly. Although there were many sellers after the opening, major players Qia Feng Yong were quite interested in buying. The HSBC bank's official exchange rate announcement showed that British and American rates were flat and still slightly stable. After that, although the white silver balance tax announcement rose by 75, it was difficult to sustain due to the continuous closing of positions by bullish players. The market gradually declined, leading to an even weaker trend at noon. The market opened flat in the afternoon, and then major players cut their long positions one after another. Chinese merchants closed their foreign exchange positions, the exchange rate loosened greatly, and people's sentiment was even weaker, and the decline continued. However, there was still some support when prices fell. Indian silver also fell by 4, 3, 2 anna. The market finally stabilized slightly. Here is a record of the day's market conditions:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1,152.70 yuan, down 2 jiao from the previous day. Although Yuan Mao Yong Fuxing Yong sold, Qia Feng Yong was quite interested in buying, and it rose to 2.90 yuan. The HSBC bank's official exchange rate announcement also remained unchanged. Later, Fuxing Yong, Dachang Xiang, Shunli, Shenda Yong, Hengchang Yong sold one after another. Although the white silver balance rose by 75, it gradually declined to 1.90 yuan. The noon closing was 1,152.0 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 1,152 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong, Jiu Da Hengchang Yong, Da De Cheng, Da Chang Xiang sold one after another, gradually retreating to 1.10 yuan. Qia Feng Yong, Fuxing Yong, etc., took advantage of the low prices to buy. The closing was 1,151.30 yuan.</p>
<p>The closing price, according to the central bank's official standard gold price, rose to 1,156.4 yuan, which, according to the closing price, was about 5 yuan higher. The account for this month was recorded at 1,149 yuan, and December at 1,152 yuan. The morning water top-up was 1,149 yuan, and pure gold was increased by 6 yuan to 1,158.7 jiao. The spot market situation was stable. Goods from Tianjin were increased by 11.5 yuan, and the buying price for cast gold was increased by 9 yuan, but there were no transactions. More than 100 taels of cast gold were sold by Shengyuan Yong, increased by 2.5 yuan. More than 200 taels were sold by Tongfeng Heng, increased by 13 yuan. Yesterday, Tiaoqi was given 7 strips and 3 yuan and 2 jiao each by Tongtai Chang and Yuan Mao Yong to Shengyuan Yong.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was mediocre. In summary, Qia Feng Yong, Tong Xing Heng Cheng, Da Ding Kang, Heng Yu Xiang Feng, Yu Xin Xiang, Fu Xing Yong, etc., were on the buying side. Heng Chang Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Fu Yu, Shenda Yong, Yi Yu, Tongtai Chang, Da De Cheng, Shengyuan Yong, Shunli, etc., were on the selling side.</p>
<p>It was observed that the market situation for the day was weak. The morning opening was 1,152.70 yuan, and the later closing was 1,151.30 yuan. The highest price was 1,152.90 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,151.10 yuan, with a fluctuation of 1.80 yuan. As a result, the closing was 1.60 yuan lower than the previous closing. There were 133 strips left from the public orders for this month. There were 6,650 chips for the December contract. In total, there were 34 bullish parties and 27 bearish parties.

<p>Although payment settlement was active in the foreign exchange market yesterday, the near and far positions of foreign exchange rates strengthened due to the closing of positions by Chinese merchants. Initially, overseas telegraphs reported that the big London rates rose 125, both near and far. The New York silver market did not move. The distant-month silver price in Montreaux rose by 2.5 to 3.5 cents. London spot gold rose by half a penny.

At the opening of the foreign exchange market, the near-term selling prices were: British exchange at 1 shilling and 2.5 pence, and American exchange at 29.5 yuan and 5625 against the tael. Compared to the previous closing, the British and American rates were both flat. After the opening, banks sold actively, but the British American Tobacco Company strongly settled shillings. The HSBC bank's official exchange rate announcement showed that British and American rates were flat and still stable. After that, although the white silver balance tax announcement rose by 75, banks still had selling appetites, as did Japanese banks. Although foreign firms had buying appetites, the situation seemed difficult to improve. The market loosened immediately in the afternoon, but it was still stable due to interbank transactions. After that, Chinese merchants suddenly came to settle US dollars, and the process continued to be difficult. Although Indian silver was slightly lower by 4.3 anna, the situation was extremely unstable in the end. The closing selling prices for the near-term months were: British exchange at 1 shilling and 2.53125 pence, and American exchange at 29.5625 yuan. Compared to the previous closing, the British rate loosened by 03125, and the American rate strengthened by 03125. Asian and British American companies, etc., all settled payments.

<p>Yesterday, the market situation at the Chinese Securities Exchange remained extremely stagnant, becoming even more sluggish. All parties showed a lack of interest, with very few new trades apart from some swap transactions. Investors and speculators alike were holding back. The evolving environment and situation made it impossible to predict whether and how future changes might occur. Bullish sentiment was relatively strong on the exchange, but there were no opportunities to seize, and the market remained in a temporary state of stagnation. Throughout the day, the market initially weakened due to significant selling of the No. 43 bond, with prices generally falling by small amounts ranging from 0.05 to 0.25 yuan. Margin trading only saw slight swap activity, and the market stabilized, with early issues showing slight weakness and later issues showing slight firmness, fluctuating by only about 0.10 yuan. The afternoon opening saw the situation remain relatively firm. Early issues were slightly weaker, while later issues were relatively firmer. The closing initially showed flat weakness, but later issues remained stable. Ultimately, due to more short selling swaps, near-term bonds fell by about 0.10 yuan and long-term bonds fell by about 0.20 yuan. However, near-term Type A bonds and long-term Type B bonds were slightly better by 0.05 to 0.10 yuan to compensate for the previous day's deficiencies. The total transaction volume was only 2,915,000 yuan. The resulting price changes are listed in the table on the left. (Unit: yuan, Transaction Unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<h3 id="e183">Grains Foreign Barley Quotes Rise, Futures Flour and Wheat Both Rise, Flour Up 0.03 to 0.05 Yuan, Wheat Jumps About 0.10 Yuan <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, the prices of all months showed a strong rebound. The price of foreign barley rose by 0.20 yuan in Chicago, and Canadian barley rose by 0.06 to 0.07 yuan. Liverpool rose by 1 pence. Therefore, after the opening, the sentiment for both near-term and long-term contracts became bullish again. Near-term contracts rose by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan, while long-term contracts rose by 0.04 to 0.05 yuan. This was because the previous day's decline had been excessive, and yesterday's foreign barley rebounded strongly. Therefore, outside buyers competed to buy in, and the market atmosphere recovered vigorously. By the afternoon opening, the market was still firm, but then bulls sold out, and new buyers were hesitant. The market turned flat and weak again. Looking ahead, because the market value has reached its peak, it will be difficult to see further gains without actual sales driving the market.</p>

<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the futures wheat market suddenly rose sharply in all months after the morning opening, because the price of foreign barley immediately rebounded by 0.20 to 0.06-0.07 yuan. The sharp decline the previous day inevitably led to a review. Furthermore, the market is now focused on changes in the international situation. Because domestic wheat is in short supply, the increase in inventory will inevitably depend on foreign barley. Therefore, the sentiment rose with the price of foreign barley, rising by about 0.10 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening was initially stable, but then the current month's contract fell by 0.02 yuan due to bulls selling out. Long-term contracts remained stable. Spot wheat prices remained fixed as customers offered sales. Shandong wheat opened at 6.05 yuan, Yaowan wheat at 6.00 yuan, Yanghe wheat at 6.012 yuan, Huaian balance at 5.99 yuan, Tiantai wheat at 5.95 yuan, Wuhu wheat at 5.90 yuan, and Luhe Jiangbei wheat at 5.97 yuan. Shanfu Xinban had 2,000 bags, and Shen Da had 500 bags.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Rice Sales Remain Sluggish <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about 40 boats arrived from the lower reaches of the river. Sales of various goods in the market remained sluggish. The price of new japonica rice fell by a small margin, and the price of thin indica rice also showed a soft trend, following a slight decline of 0.01 to 0.02 yuan in early trading. Baiyuan also saw a slight decline, while high-quality Yinyuan rice remained stable, with medium and low grades showing sluggish transactions. Various indica rice varieties saw weak sales, with prices trending downward. All other goods also showed a soft trend.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods was slightly scarce, with a total of 37 or 38 boats arriving, carrying a total of over 8,000 shi of goods. Sales in the local market were average. Bag merchants, including Pingjin Biaoyan and other groups, purchased over 2,000 bags of new japonica rice and over 4,000 bags of thin indica rice. Therefore, the market situation for thin indica rice did not improve, and prices rose by 0.05 yuan. Thick new japonica rice only remained stable. Looking at the overall trend, thin indica rice may have a chance of continuing to rise if the supply source does not become strong again. Du indica rice saw no gains or losses. Foreign sharp rice sales were sluggish and showed a soft trend. New Yinyuan rice was mediocre, and new Bianyuan rice alone fell by 0.10 yuan because the opening price was too high.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Rough Indica Rice Guangdong Continues to Purchase Over 7,000 Bags <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, over 10,000 bags of guest indica rice continued to arrive. Due to sluggish sales in recent days, the market situation continued to soften. The market atmosphere was very weak in the morning. Subsequently, guest merchants took advantage of the small market and inquired. As the weather turned sunny, the number of buyers also became slightly more active. The previous purchases by Guangdong merchants were nearly loaded, and yesterday they also purchased over 7,000 bags of various rough rice varieties. Henan merchants also actively purchased late Jing rice. Local Shantou and Ningbo merchants also inquired, and the market finally stabilized. However, the market has been soft for a long time, and there is a large amount of inventory. Although guest sales are active, market prices have not risen. Throughout the day, 6,281 bags of Jiangxi rice, 6,100 bags of Hunan rice, 300 bags of Hubei rice, and 246 bags of Ningbo and Taizhou rice were sold.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Sugar Market Ordinary Cotton and Red Sugar Prices Remain Flat <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable. The guild set the price for No. 24 coarse granulated white spot goods at 21.65 yuan, but no transactions were made. Re-export goods fell slightly by 0.05 yuan to 6.05 yuan. Only No. 8 white spot goods (N mark) were traded at 21.40 yuan, while the rest remained unchanged. The price of cotton from this factory, Jin Xin No. 1, was 20.50 yuan, No. 2 was 20.30 yuan, No. 3 was 20.10 yuan, No. 4 was 19.90 yuan, and No. 5 was 19.70 yuan. There were also no significant changes. Only the Chaozhou merchants offered prices for bag-packed ordinary cotton and red sugar, with several hundred bags priced at 14.45 to 14.50 yuan. Because the cost of Chaoqing sugar was high and there were concerns about a poor harvest in the producing areas, they did not offer excessively low prices and maintained their position.</p>

<p>Due to severe drought in the Sichuan pickled mustard producing areas, seeds have not yet been planted, which is bound to affect future harvests. Therefore, prices suddenly rose sharply, increasing by as much as 5 yuan. Upon hearing the news, local merchants were greatly excited. Shapai Leqi mustard was offered at 27.50 yuan, and Fuling mustard was offered at 23 yuan, with a total of 400 to 500 jars sold. Inventory was scarce. On the road, Shangpai Hongliyuan Leqi mustard was quoted at 28 to 29 yuan, and market prices also rose by 4 to 5 yuan. Leqi mustard was sold at 24 yuan, and Fuling mustard was sold at 20 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the overseas silk market saw a boost as the New York election results were announced, and Mr. Roosevelt was re-elected as president. The exchange market atmosphere was quite invigorated, and the silk industry also followed suit. Near-term contracts rose by 0.05 yuan, and long-term contracts rose by 0.03 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 2,570 dan. The Yokohama silk market also rose rapidly, with spot goods rising by 20 yuan and current goods rising by 19 yuan. The local silk market also recovered. Although market prices did not improve, Mitsui and other firms had strong purchasing intentions. The silk market is expected to gradually become active. Yesterday, a total of 265 bales of domestic and foreign silk were sold in the local market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the foreign tea market, Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi was still selling well.

<p>Kelp: According to telegrams from Hakodate, Qingdao merchants have been purchasing in large quantities at the production area recently, and market prices have gradually risen. Local firms, upon receiving this information, have tightened their sales of existing stock. Furthermore, the supply of new goods is scarce, and sales are strong. Demand from Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other places is very high, so all grades are in short supply. The current market price for Nemuro medium grade is 11 yuan, Aoba is 10.40 yuan, Maozoku is 9.80 yuan, Niban is 9.20 yuan, and Sanban is 7.20 yuan. The head of the First Bank's price is out of stock, and goods on the road are being sold at 9.80 yuan. All firms are making fixed sales, and the transaction volume is about 1,200 to 1,300 packages.</p>
<p>Ribbon Kelp: Supply is also limited, and the market is stable. (No. 2) Hakodate goods are sold for over 13 yuan, Bai'an goods are sold for 11.50 yuan, and Osaka Shuanglong mark goods have passed through. For next month's futures, foreign firms are selling 300 packages at a price of 10 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e201">The Most Beautiful Short Letter <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Original by German author Bruno Frank</p>
<p>The most touching letter I know of is the one that Ivan Turgenev wrote to Leo Tolstoy shortly before his death.</p>
<p>Here is the letter: -</p>
<p>"Bougival, June 27th or 28th, 1883.</p>
<p>Dear and kind Lev Nikolayevich! I have not written to you for a long time because I have been, and in fact still am, lying on my deathbed. As for regaining my health – that is completely hopeless, and it is not worth thinking about. I am actually writing to you simply to make you understand how proud I have been to be your contemporary and to make one last and sincere request of you. — My friend, return to literary work! Because your talent comes to you from the source of all other things, as you know. How happy I would be if I felt certain that my request would affect you!</p>
<p>I am a 'finished' man – many doctors do not even know what to call my illness – 'neuralgic gastralgia with gout'. I can neither walk, nor eat, nor sleep, so what is left for me to do? Even speaking about it is enough to suffer. My friend, great writer of the Russian land – heed my request. —"</p>
<p>How passionately hope surges from these few lines! The emotion of life, in such a state, emits such a farewell greeting, how precious are all the wishes! Renan (also a member of the literary group in Paris to which Turgenev belonged) once described the nineteenth century as a gentle and beautiful period, with a climate suitable for the development of art and science, which would inevitably be followed by a rough period. Ah, yes, the rough period followed as he said. The nineteenth century, the last to bid farewell to ancient culture, seems to be a paradise of harmony and wisdom to those who have been exiled and experienced great suffering as they look back on it.</p>
<p>Literary critics with strict standards do not acknowledge that Turgenev's grave deserves a place in the holy ground of their great deceased writers. They do not consider him a genius, but merely a talented person. This is indeed the case. He was despised by the profound genius of Russia, Dostoevsky. It is true that Dostoevsky unexpectedly visited him, cursing him in front of the startled man for committing a dishonorable act, and declaring that placing him in a lower position than someone like Turgenev was the most severe curse that heaven could inflict upon him. Turgenev, however, was well-suited to be with the group of famous writers he met in Paris—such as Flaubert, the Goncourt brothers, Zola, Taine, and Renan—all of whom had the same soul and resembled him, and all of whom loved him. They called him the gentle giant (Le doux géant). The keynote of his character was humanity, built upon a foundation of human emotion and a discerning knowledge of the doubtfulness of facts. Observing oneself is also fitting. Without indulging in false and absurd dreams, but instead persisting without retreating in life, being benevolent without fear – this is a difficult ideal to grasp as an encouragement, especially for an era like the one we live in, an era whose typical figures are utterly despicable – these people are foolish, corrupt, and at the same time intoxicated with gaudy rhetoric.</p>
<p>With less extravagance and artificiality than Turgenev's letter, they would amount to nothing. "I have been and still am lying on my deathbed," in his opinion, was already a bit too much, too forceful, so he added the touching "in fact," a kind of annoying little phrase, also a kind of apologetic expression that he had to tell himself in such a serious and touching state. His symptoms must have been terrible, with the entire nerve surface of the skin swollen, constantly experiencing agonizing pain. But there is not a single word about the pain! He begins by openly describing his situation and slightly satirizing the doctors, but immediately dismisses it: "Even speaking about it is enough to suffer."</p>
<p>What he means is: Tolstoy might feel uncomfortable. In his knowledge, familiar with the human alienation due to doubt, which separates individuals, he avoids evoking an emotional response from another person for more than a minute. But he also knows that everyone will be uncomfortable if their sympathy and pity are exploited. Because in this sentence, he does not directly appeal to Tolstoy, he omits the pronoun and speaks generally. This omitted pronoun, in its perfection and solemnity, can surpass all publicly written works and spoken words of the current year in Europe.</p>
<p>Now, let's return to the vow written by the hand of this person destined to die: "How proud I have been to be your contemporary." How admirable the humility, how deep the heartfelt reverence, to have such a turn of phrase! Does it not mean, and even more than it means, that this dying man looks back on his past life, reviews all the joys it could give him, and finds that the greatest joy was having read "War and Peace" and "Anna Karenina"?</p>
<p>Even if it was this cold and stubborn 1877. Not long after, Tolstoy life, he betrayed his life from birth to strict end, lost , he "born" female school absolute , completely devoted to theological research, translated "Gospel ". Doubtless Turgenev his method of request some sublime trick. A dying , he tells like this, is very possible to achieve the purpose, and attract Tolstoy attention. But this matter for him is very important, so he applies the weak quantity appeal his wishes! 'How should I be glad…' He is a non-believer, he knows when the loess covers his body, everything for him will be over, but he does not neglect that after he leaves the world everything ' ' will flourish to select work yesterday.</p>
<p>He did not act like those disgustingly fashionable things that became common later, he did not do such a thing, comparing art, poetry itself, with life, thinking it was not important enough, similar events should bring shame to the author. Truly important work should increase in the world, is</p>
<p>concerned, this heart will soon stop beating, in addition, Russia should help this treasure to increase, that is this cosmopolitan patriotism. 'My friend, great writer of the Russian land!'</p>
<p>A friend visited Socrates in his prison cell on the eve of his execution and found him learning a new tune on the seven-stringed lyre. The friend exclaimed: "Socrates, you will be executed soon, and you are still learning a new song today?" To this, Socrates replied, "Well, my friend, what time will you allow me to learn it?" This is the spirit of our letter.</p>
<p>But after declaring hopelessness, Turgenev pleads with another writer to exert his great talent as before, he adds a reason, an encouragement: "Because your talent comes to you from the source of all things, as you know." That event is somewhat immortal. Turgenev wrote Fathers and Sons, Smoke, A Nest of Gentlefolk, and other early works, Russia serfdom opening the way, but this insignificant sentence should not be forgotten, soaring above other works. We see this patient, at the time was to make Tolstoy understand bearing the responsibility that talent should bear, we see how he in a religious manner, conferring to this admirable post-mortem, we feel how he's suspicious, in his bravely dead and without religion, how is it for the sake of readable, unwilling to use less pseudo means, while saying things we completely neglect, the results produce this precise and transcendental turn of phrase. This great man and writer greatly tolerated another writer, he believed in religion, or at least fervently wished to believe in religion, but he himself was forever true, true like a person, true like a philosopher.</p>
<p>No, indeed, humanity is not an empty word. Do not be absorbed by the pretenses of this turbulent era, nor by those violent people, nor be deceived by those with Stvitus stancer and those with whatever creeds chanting! Go towards truth, towards simplicity, have a benevolent heart, remain optimistic, strive for tranquility in sorrow and hardship, love life and do not hate death, cultivate the spirit and do not be disturbed by external things – since the beginning of the world, there has been no better lesson. (Translated by Xiang Yu)</p>

<h3 id="e203">Mr. Lu Xun and Literature <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Qinwen</p>
<p>"Giant of the literary world," "Authority of the literary world," since Mr. Lu Xun's death, these kinds of titles can almost be seen every day in magazines and newspapers. Just the book "Call to Arms" alone, in fact, with just the story of "The True Story of Ah Q," at least in terms of creation, Mr. Lu Xun had already cut a deep line between old and new literature. No matter what, in the New Literature world, it cannot be denied that he was an advanced pioneer; and few people can compare to his strength. However, he himself did not intend to be known for literature; this can be understood by simply reading the preface to "Call to Arms." The production of "Call to Arms," in his original intention, was out of necessity. Because he knew that "what is good at changing the spirit is, I... believe that of course it should be literature and art;"</p>
<p>He clearly stated this kind of preface in "Call to Arms." But he also understood that, in order to change the spirit of the general public, there were things more important than literature. He engaged in literature and had a grand harvest. It is said that as long as one of his short articles was published, no matter what magazine, sales would certainly increase several times. In fact, many young people had received his guidance and were influenced by him.</p>
<p>The reason why Mr. Lu Xun's articles were so touching and so popular was because he made various efforts besides writing articles; of course, he was able to resist the powerful and support the weak, to fight for the glory of the nation, in reality, he was a brave warrior, and literature to him was just a kind of tool like knives and guns. Although Mr. Lu Xun's means of making everyone believe often changed, the spirit of struggling desperately at the forefront of the times was always consistent, and his views on literature certainly changed along with the trend. This is not surprising. New literature, of course, must be based on actual life; Mr. Lu Xun, the "Call to Arms" that he began to create, was "literature of problems;" -- in order to change the spirit of his foolish and weak compatriots, he described it in great detail in the preface to "Call to Arms."</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun, who has been writing for thirty years, if he "stuck to" the old ways, then there would be no so-called "giant" or "authority," or "Lu Xun" as a profession.</p>
<p>Engaging in literature can usually be divided into four aspects to start with, which are promotion, creation, criticism, and introduction. Mr. Lu Xun promoted it more than thirty years ago, created world-famous works such as "Call to Arms," criticism can be seen everywhere in his miscellaneous essays, and introduction, his translations are also numerous enough. What is more noteworthy is the literature about the damaged and weak ethnic groups. Then he has all four aspects complete, and all are excellent. But this is not surprising, he has a long history, and it was not achieved all at once.</p>

<p>Oh, you are gone</p>
<p>You, the wet nurse who fed the souls of the Chinese people</p>
<p>Your health was our happiness (Note 1)</p>
<p>In the East</p>
<p>This sinful year</p>
<p>Gorky passed away</p>
<p>And you are gone again</p>
<p>The Chinese people are in suffering</p>
<p>The jackals are showing off their ferocity</p>
<p>"I am a Chinese</p>
<p>For the sake of the motherland</p>
<p>When this pen is useless</p>
<p>I still have my actions</p>
<p>As long as I live</p>
<p>"I should do my best for the masses" (Note 2)</p>
<p>Could you not suffer a little more hardship</p>
<p>Do a little more service</p>
<p>"My father did not leave me any money..."</p>
<p>These are your heartbreaking words in illness</p>
<p>Your illness was not incurable</p>
<p>Yet, ah</p>
<p>You finally left</p>
<p>Is what you left for people also too little</p>
<p>Today, the Chinese people are in suffering</p>
<p>The masses of the whole world are also in suffering</p>
<p>The pack of jackals are showing off their ferocity</p>
<p>Did you just peacefully close those hawk eyes</p>
<p>And not give them one more glare</p>
<p>October 20, 1936, Luozhen.</p>

<h3 id="e205">The Question of the Founder of Naturalistic Drama <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Hou Feng</p>
<p>Regarding French naturalistic drama, people generally believe that it started with Henri Becque, but in reality, the one who first established the theory of naturalism and then struggled to implement this theory was Émile Zola. Because Becque's naturalistic play "Les Corbeaux" was first performed at the Comédie-Française in France in 1882; Zola published his theory of naturalistic drama in newspapers such as "Bien Public" and "Voltaire," causing heated debate in the theater world at the time, but this was in 1876-77. As for his first naturalistic play, "Thérèse Raquin," its performance was in 1873. Therefore, regarding the name of naturalistic drama, establishing the theory of naturalistic drama, practice, and struggle in various aspects, Zola was nine years earlier than Becque.</p>
<p>For the proposal and practice of the theory of naturalistic drama, Zola became the target of public criticism in the French literary world at the time. The opposition's slander and injury to him can be said to have been all-pervasive, and he was hit by the "non-purchase alliance" established by various theaters against his plays, but Zola did not lose heart because of this. The malicious criticism of what is called "despicable" cannot really erase the actual existence of the theoretical drama of our founder of naturalism based on the spirit of the times, but rather reveals the magnitude of his realistic power. So his "Thérèse Raquin" also achieved a "startling" effect.</p>
<p>Regarding the traces of the growth of naturalistic drama, we can seek it in Zola's theory and works. Starting from his "Thérèse Raquin," which was originally a novel and later rewritten into a play, he faithfully practiced his theory, whether in form or content, all starting from naturalism, all the way to the later "Renée" (five-act play, first performed on April 16, 1887), etc., all clearly expressed the process of naturalistic drama's conception, growth, and maturity. As for Becque's plays later being called models of realism, it was due to being stimulated by that kind of opportunity.</p>
<p>The realistic drama movement that was set off at Antoine's Théâtre Libre was entirely the expansion of Zola's theory. And those famous realistic playwrights from the end of the 19th century to around the time of World War I were directly or indirectly influenced by Zola's dramatic theory. Even now, Zola's dramatic theory is still a major trend in the theater world. This is certainly not without reason. In short, Zola is not only a guide for naturalistic drama, but also the founder of naturalistic drama.</p>

<p>— Yongzhi</p>
<p>Because a friend overseas wanted me to forward a letter to Mr. Lu Xun, I had the opportunity to meet him once. The letter was very ordinary, and I could have just given it to the Uchiyama Bookstore to forward to him, and that would have been the end of it. However, my friend specifically instructed me to hand it over in person and had something he wanted to discuss with him face to face, so I had no choice but to go find him and meet him.</p>
<p>That day, I walked to Uchiyama Bookstore bathed in the gentle sunlight. I explained my purpose, and Mr. Uchiyama asked me to wait while he notified him on my behalf. I sat and waited for a while, but unexpectedly, a lady came. After Mr. Uchiyama's explanation, I learned that she was sent by Mr. Lu Xun.</p>
<p>"I am Mr. Zhou's student," she introduced herself first, "Mr. Zhou is not at home. If there is anything, we might as well talk about it first." She said very gently.</p>
<p>"This is a letter from Mr. ×, you can take a look," I said as I took a letter from my pocket and handed it to the lady. After she read it, knowing that Mr. × instructed that we had something to discuss face to face and that the letter also had to be handed over in person, she returned the letter to me as before. She also arranged the time and place for our meeting the next day on his behalf. The next day I went to Uchiyama Bookstore, and Mr. Lu Xun had already arrived. He was sitting diagonally near the door, his face was very gray and pale, his clothes were not very clean, but his eyes looked at me very powerfully. Of course, after Mr. Uchiyama explained, we began to talk.</p>
<p>I handed him the letter from Mr. ×.</p>
<p>"The person you met yesterday is my wife. She told you that she was my student, right?" he said with a slight smile, as if he was making a clarification while reading the letter.</p>
<p>"Haha," I only responded like this. "That is Ms. Guangping from your correspondence books, right?" I thought about saying this, but I only smiled and did not say it out loud. He immediately stood up.</p>
<p>"Let's go to the café in front to talk in detail, shall we?" He looked at me, I only nodded, and then I walked out of Uchiyama Bookstore with him.</p>
<p>We walked to a small café about half a mile away from Uchiyama Bookstore. After we were seated, he continued reading the letter. After reading the letter, he said to me very happily:</p>
<p>"What do you think of my health? They are always worried about my health. Actually, they have been abroad for too long and are used to seeing huge Westerners, so naturally they think my body is weak. In the end, I don't have any illness. It seems that I am not strong, but in reality, I am still okay. I am working every day." He said faintly, dragging out his not-so-fluent Mandarin with some Shaoxing accent mixed in.</p>
<p>"I hope that you can go abroad to recuperate for a while as your friends expect," I replied to him without thinking. In reality, I really felt sorry for this old warrior. His body was not doing well, and the environment was oppressively cruel to him. How could he support himself with such internal and external attacks? "And Mr. × is afraid that you are having economic difficulties. He has also entrusted a friend to help you borrow money, which will be returned after you arrive there, and this friend has already agreed." I continued, saying that my friend wanted me to speak plainly to him, fearing that he would be troubled by economics. But I did not answer him about his health. Because I saw that he had quite strong confidence in his own health, but in reality, his body was not doing well, so how could I answer? By the way, I also told him that his friends overseas had heard many unfavorable rumors about him. Everyone was worried, so they hoped even more that he would go abroad to live for a while.</p>
<p>He smiled, smoked a cigarette, and said slowly:</p>
<p>"Rumors, well, there are rumors all year round, how can there be so many that stand out? Going abroad to live for a while is naturally good, and I have also planned to do so. But if I were to be scared away by rumors, then there is no need. Because it is impossible to live abroad for a long time, and I will have to come back to China eventually. At that time, there may be even more rumors." After he said these words, he suddenly asked me if I knew Mr. ××. I told him that I had known him for ten years and that I was also his teacher at ×× University.</p>
<p>He heard that I knew Mr. Xu. So he told me a lot of news about Mr. Xu, from Mr. Xu's recent life, to the course of his death. As well as many rumors about him after his death. He also told me that he was collecting various posthumous works for him. He planned to spend half a year compiling Mr. Xu's posthumous works. And tidy up all his own things, and then talk about going abroad. Not being able to go abroad immediately, this is also an important reason.</p>
<p>"His posthumous works are really valuable, they will give great contributions to mankind, I am editing his posthumous works, not only for the private feelings of friends." He said this in a slightly sad tone at the end.</p>
<p>I was silent for a while and asked him if he was planning to write a reply to Mr. ×. He thought for a moment and said, "No need, please tell them on my behalf."</p>
<p>Finally, we agreed on the place for correspondence and meeting. Because I had asked him that in the future, if there was a place where I needed his help in writing.</p>
<p>We walked out of the café together, nodded to each other lightly, and then walked away in opposite directions. I walked about five yards away and looked back at him. He was slowly walking diagonally into the northwest corner, bathed in the sunlight.</p>
<p>After separating, there was no second chance to meet. Later, in the newspaper, I found the news of the old warrior's death, which gave me a severe shock! I couldn't breathe for half a day. In the past few days, I have only been looking for news about his death in the newspaper. After all, the spirit of our old warrior who fought for national liberation has been distributed to the broad masses! In recent days, thousands upon thousands of workers, students, and shop assistants are vying to pay their respects to the remains of our dead old warrior. Doesn't this show that his unfinished cause has been inherited by these successors?</p>

<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>"How annoying, the candy maker is here again. Last time my little brother ate his candy Buddha and had diarrhea for several days. He's here again!"</p>
<p>Jumping out of the rickshaw with Jingyi, I saw a crowd of children surrounding a candy maker at the entrance of the alley. The candy maker was blowing sugar into the shape of a sugar rat and pinching its ears and tail with his hands. Jingyi found our little brother in the crowd of children, and couldn't help but feel a little impatient.</p>
<p>"Don't look down on the candy maker. Although he makes a living on the street, he is an art master."</p>
<p>Jingyi couldn't help laughing when she heard what I said. She said, "Where are there so many art masters?"</p>
<p>I thought, there are many art masters on the street, such as the calligrapher who draws turtles on the walls, the musician who sells huqins and flutes, the playwright who plays wooden puppets, the genius poet who sings lotus ballads, the literary failures who narrate or confess in their complaints, as well as the sculptors who knead gray dough figures or make clay figurines, the national art doctors who sell magic tricks, and the great directors who turn peep shows. Although they have never openly claimed to be art masters, it is not too much to call them that, is it?</p>
<p>I saw that on the candy maker's stall, a clump of grass was inserted with many artworks for people to exhibit without charging admission. Those were all goods he wanted to clear out, not for sale and not priced high. However, the grass clump seemed to be divided into two distinct layers: the lower layer consisted of monkeys, cats, rats, chickens, dogs, fish, shrimp, spoons, and still life objects such as trumpets and water pipes; the upper layer consisted of human figures, from Guan Gong holding a broadsword to generals wearing command swords, as if symbolizing heroes who dared to fight in ancient and modern times. Could it be that the slogan of "national defense" has also influenced this art master? I wonder if they have ever had debates over the slogans of "national defense" and "nation"? However, what I paid attention to was not here, but just staring blankly at those sugar-made heroes wearing armor and carrying weapons. Although they are sugar-made heroes, they may not be able to defend against insults and fight wars, but they are also awe-inspiring and inviolable, as if suppressing a group of pitiful animals in their lower layer.</p>
<p>"Dad, Mom is waiting for you to go back for dinner."</p>
<p>I heard my little brother calling me, and then I left the candy stall. But from this sugar-made hero, I thought of "straw toffee" - a story in history. It turns out that the art of kneading sugar figures has "existed since ancient times."</p>
<p>During the Sui Dynasty, there was an upright official named Liang Yanguang, who, after losing his official position, lived in seclusion at home. One day, the emperor summoned him to ask questions and ordered him to be the prefect of Zhao Prefecture. He said, "I won't go to Zhao Prefecture. If I go, I'll go to Xiang Prefecture." The emperor said, "Haven't you been to Xiang Prefecture before?" He said, "Last time I was the prefect of Xiang Prefecture, I didn't want to disturb the people, so I didn't want to do too much, thinking that it was better to be still than to move. Unexpectedly, the people there laughed at me for being confused and bullied me for being weak, comparing me to a sugar-made official, thinking that I was good-looking but useless, and giving me the nickname 'straw toffee.' Therefore, I lost my official position. I thought I would never come out again in my life, but unexpectedly, the emperor's grace allowed me to be the prefect of Zhao Prefecture again. So, I still want to return to Xiang Prefecture to do something and wash away my previous shame." The emperor then allowed him. This time, when he went to Xiang Prefecture, he actually became a very capable official. The Book of Sui includes this story, I wonder if it is reliable?</p>
<p>"Straw toffee" and "sugar-made heroes" also look like people, arousing wonderful thoughts that people are also like them. The candy maker is worthy of being an art master.</p>

<h3 id="e209">Pure Culture of Gonorrhea The Gonococci Seen on the Slant Culture Medium of Test Tubes <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>

<p>...Gonococci in physiological saline solution peel off from the entire base surface and float...Completely dead and gone when treated with the most agile scientific method</p>
<p>Although we doctors regard clinical diagnosis and treatment as our duty, the research of books and the exploration of chemical laboratories are all urgently needed. Therefore, the chemistry laboratory is to the doctor as the hospital bed is, what the doctor urgently needs.</p>
<p>Today, in the chemistry laboratory, a dazzling "miracle" suddenly caught our eyes, praised by gonorrhea experts around the world! This matter is not only about the effective methods already available for the simple treatment of gonorrhea, but also about the valuable contributions to academics.</p>
<p>This latest contribution is to take gonococci from the body or turbid urine of gonorrhea patients and make a "pure culture" using a test tube with an inclined culture medium. This procedure has become a spectacle. At this time, after coating the entire culture medium and culturing it, it is put into a 20-meter saline test tube and temporarily placed, and the bacterial culture is seen floating in the saline solution, and the gonococci on the entire culture medium surface are peeled off and floated, showing extreme activity. If a lipid-like juice is put into the test tube, and another fresh culture medium is placed in this test tube, the gonococci on the culture medium must be completely dead and completely eliminated within two or three days. This is really an unprecedented and strange story, and the treatment of gonorrhea has found an important clue in the chaotic and unprincipled crossroads!</p>
<p>The lipid-like juice is a kind of protein in animals and plants. Its killing of gonococci is not a violent crusade with the power of potent poison, but a gentle and effective step-by-step sterilization effect, which is the characteristic of protein. Based on this principle, this protein is mixed with a yellow pigment that clears urine and reduces inflammation to make an oral preparation, which has become today's popular "Kerlinong", a special drug for gonorrhea that is popular in various famous hospitals and doctors' clinical practice! It is effective for male gonorrhea, testicular swelling and hardening, seminal vesiculitis, nocturnal emission with blood, and various types of gonorrhea such as acute urethral pain! For women whose leucorrhea is transmitted by their husband's gonorrhea, because of cervical mucosal erosion and vaginitis, it is especially necessary to take "Kerlinong" to clear the gonococci in the body and private parts, so it is easy to cure. Moreover, on the one hand, "Carter Shendi's vaginal tablets" should be used externally to wash away leucorrhea, and quickly and completely recover.</p>
<p>Because of these characteristics, "Kerlinong's" treatment of gonorrhea has been generally praised!</p>

<p>...How to rekindle the flame of your life? ...Enjoy a meaningful and happy life again?</p>
<p>'Drag down the entire life of masturbation!'</p>
<p>The basis of human development lies in the health of the gonads - the puberty glands. And the essence secreted is semen. Unfortunately, it is injured by masturbation during puberty; masturbation once is like cutting an axe on the lifeline; as a result, the entire life is dragged away by this masturbation. We often encounter young people who are cowardly and irritable, prone to anger, easy to get tired, have weak attention, headaches, and pale faces. Needless to say, he has already been poisoned by the demon of masturbation. And what the patient himself feels most painful is the smallness of the sexual organs and the attacks of nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea. These are all symptoms of psychosexual neurasthenia, and also the prelude to erectile dysfunction. If the disease develops to this stage, then his appearance will be even more decadent, his eyes will be dull, covered with dark circles, his limbs will be cold, and his steps will be staggering. This is a vivid photograph brewed by masturbation.</p>
<p>How should we rekindle the dying flame of life and enjoy the meaningful two-sex happiness of life? According to Dr. Gainsborough of England, we should immediately stop masturbation; at the same time, we should take a large amount of hormone preparations; according to my experience after graduating from the Imperial Medical University of Japan and returning to China, taking the drug "Butecon" is the most effective, because "Butecon" is made of hormones from brave animals; it can cure various symptoms caused by masturbation: nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, underdevelopment, long-term infertility, and all neurasthenia such as headaches, insomnia, palpitations, and forgetfulness, can be taken "Butecon" to eliminate them. Because the hormone increases after taking it, in addition to promoting vigorous metabolism and sexual organ development, it can also enrich muscles and change the decadent appearance into a delicate, fair, and shiny face. As indicated in most examples, those who take "Butecon" and obtain results are more than 93% to 94%. Those with nocturnal emission can also take "Niles nocturnal emission tablets" to consolidate the sperm gate, which is a more comprehensive treatment method.</p>

<p>Premature aging...Insomnia and forgetfulness</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Pingjian, 34 years old, gold industry. (Cause of disease) - Extremely weak congenital endowment, and due to the harm of early marriage, hormone function is lost, resulting in incomplete development. (Symptoms) - Short stature, sexual organs as thin as index fingers. Back curvature, mental depression, words and harmonies are weak, husband's job is deficient, ejaculation immediately after unloading. Difficulty sleeping at night.

(Diagnosis and treatment) - After using scientific methods to examine, it was diagnosed that not only the reproductive part was weak, but also the whole body was lacking hormones, so electrical therapy was used. And mainly use "Butecon" to supplement hormones, about four weeks, the vitality is greatly boosted, the righteous energy is exuberant, and the spirit is happy.</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea...Weak body</p>
<p>Mr. Wen Yunzhen, 18 years old, academic circles. (Cause of disease) - Due to youth and ignorance, seduced by bad friends, committed masturbation, and became a bad habit. (Symptoms) - Frequent nocturnal emission, many dreams, heart palpitations, mental fatigue and physical weakness, inability to work, difficulty remembering when studying, resulting in a great decline in academic performance. And there are five nocturnal emissions a week or once a day. After bowel movements, there is even semen flowing out. He was introduced by a friend and came to me for treatment. (Diagnosis and treatment) - I ordered him to take a cold water bath, and ordered him to go to the Western Pharmacy Department of Wing On Company to buy and take "Niles nocturnal emission tablets" to cure nocturnal emission, and take "Butecon" to remedy the weakened nerves. He was completely cured in less than a month.</p>
<h3 id="e212">A Respectful Contribution to Neurasthenic Women <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Wu Zhonglin, Graduate of Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>Neurasthenia is the cause of emotional breakdown. A lesson for those who want to have a sweet two-sex life</p>
<p>Women with a quiet and gentle personality are the best, and most women have this personality. However, if a woman is hit hard by early marriage or masturbation, and too many births, the gonads are greatly impacted, resulting in deficiency of both qi and blood, and the nerves are also stimulated and gradually age. Often presenting the excitement of sex. Melancholy and irritable (commonly known as liver fire rising), often an unnecessary trivial matter is also regarded as a major matter, and doubts gradually arise. Such women must have irregular menstruation, are anemic, and have headaches, backaches, cold backs, weak feet, tinnitus, and blurred vision. Loss of appetite, cold personality, or unusually violent, these are all injuries to the gonads, and the ovaries lose their complete mechanism. In addition, there is leucorrhea running, and the lower part is eroded.</p>
<p>Since graduating from Nantong Medical University and opening a practice, I have treated those who suffer from this disease with "Bunuyong" to replenish blood and regulate menstruation, strengthen the brain and strengthen the body, so that the fragile nerves can return to health. Restore a quiet and gentle personality, so that the two sexes will not break up and divorce due to sexual incompatibility, and those who are infertile can become pregnant again, and those who are physically weak can recover. It is really the most reasonable treatment for women's diseases, and its remaining effects are to maintain beauty and beauty. However, those who suffer from leucorrhea should still take "Bunuyong", and at the same time use "Carter Shendi's vaginal tablets" as suppositories.</p>

<p>— Dr. Chen Minbo, Returned from Japan</p>
<p>The most effective method of quitting smoking</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Beiping, 4th: The Ping Municipal Authorities have decided to execute a large number of addicts on January 1st next year. Therefore, thousands of thin-skinned coffins have been custom-made in the south of the city. The woodworking factory that undertakes the production is working hard day and night because it is only more than 50 days away from the execution of the smoking criminals. So on.</p>
<p>The end of the road for smokers has arrived - this has become a reality. People who smoke quit and smoke again, if they don't have determination, then they are really giving up on themselves. However, the pain of quitting smoking is also the reason that promotes smokers to smoke again!</p>
<p>To avoid pain, it is only foolproof to increase the hormones in the whole body. According to my experiment: taking the hormone drug "Butecon" has the greatest effect, and there is no pain at all, and quitting addiction is especially fast and reliable.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Terrible Gonorrheal Seminal Vesiculitis <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Deng Yuanhe</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Jin Dehun has suffered from gonorrhea for three years; his lower abdomen is swollen, and he occasionally has hernia pain, and he has discomfort in the perineum and anus; he has frequent urination. Suspecting that he has seminal vesiculitis, he examined his semen (secretions) under a microscope. The semen was grayish-yellow and grayish-red, mixed with pus and blood, and most of the sperm were also dead (as shown in the first picture), so he has been unable to have children for many years. It was confirmed that it was seminal vesiculitis, so he was given "Kerlinong" oral medication to resist gonorrhea, kill bacteria, reduce inflammation and relieve pain. After taking it for more than a month, he reported complete recovery. The semen secreted by him was still examined under a microscope. It was already grayish-white and transparent, with small starch-like lumps like sago (as shown in the second picture). (According to the picture, the tadpole-shaped ones are our sperm.) The normal semen was restored, which is proof that "Kerlinong" cures seminal vesiculitis. If this disease is not cured, it will be difficult to have children. "Kerlinong" is not only effective for seminal vesiculitis, but also has special effects on all acute and chronic gonorrhea sequelae and complications, so it can be popular around the world as the savior of gonorrhea.</p>

<p>— Dr. Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>Leucorrhea is generally ignored by women because of its hidden disease. Therefore, delayed treatment will kill the vaginal bacilli due to the erosion of dirty liquid, causing external bacteria to take the opportunity to enter, from the vagina to the uterus and straight into the ovaries, thus inducing various unpredictable symptoms. The most obvious bad result is to cause menstrual difficulties, uterine bleeding, and physical weakness, thus losing the ability to conceive. In clinical statistics, leucorrhea accounts for the majority of the causes of many infertility cases. Because leucorrhea can most kill sperm and destroy the health of ovarian function.</p>
<p>According to our experience, the causes are: unclean sexual intercourse, rough sex that breaks the mucosa. Some are due to physical weakness. Therefore, the method of treatment is to use "Carter Shendi's vaginal tablets" as suppositories for antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic purposes. Those caused by gonorrhea can also take "Kerlinong" to eliminate internal gonorrhea. If it is caused by physical weakness and irregular menstruation, you can also take "Bunuyong" to strengthen the body and regulate menstruation. In this way, leucorrhea can be completely eradicated, and the ability to conceive can be restored. This treatment can be used by every patient at home without any drawbacks.</p>

<p>(Clinic): Corner of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road (Consultation time): 10:00 am to 6:00 pm.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea that destroys reproduction</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is essentially caused by unclean sexual behavior. The lesions are also in the genital area. So it is most likely to cause infertility. However, because patients have no common sense about gonorrhea, they often let it go, or although they seek medical advice and take medicine, they suffer from a lack of discrimination and can only blindly explore the treatment. As a result, gonorrhea is not cured in most cases, but the deepening and prolongation of the virus are increased. They also cannot maintain long-term abstinence and other necessary health care, so the tissues of the reproductive system are constantly destroyed by gonococci, and the evil consequences of infertility are formed in these places. Thinking about it is terrifying. The most likely gonorrhea to destroy reproductive function is prostatitis, orchitis, vasitis, seminal vesiculitis, etc. Because these sexual organs hold the greatest responsibility for reproduction. However, unfortunately, gonorrhea patients often develop these symptoms as sequelae and complications. However, before the virus is deep and the tissues are not completely destroyed, proper treatment can be effective, and the healthy sexual and reproductive function can be repeated.</p>
<p>Based on my many years of experience, I feel that the treatment of this kind of gonorrhea must have anti-gonococcal oral medication. And on the one hand, it is more appropriate to supplement it with electrotherapy and anti-gonococcal serum. There is Mr. Yu Tinglie, who lives on Shandong Road. After being infected with gonorrhea, he did not know how to treat it properly, resulting in complications of orchitis and prostatitis. Testicular swelling and pain, difficult and obstructed urination, perineal and anal pain. After suffering from the disease, he was not careful in sexual intercourse, causing his wife to be infected. Became a virulent leucorrhea. He had never had children after marriage. Although he did not give up medicine all year round, his disease worsened. Later, I read my "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases". I asked for my treatment. After examination, I learned that Yu's prostate was about to leak, and his testicles also had a tendency to harden. This is clear evidence that the sexual organs are about to be destroyed, so he was instructed to go to the China and West Pharmacy to buy and take "Kerlinong" to increase anti-gonococcal substances to reduce inflammation, relieve pain, antiseptic and diuretic. At the same time, electrotherapy and anti-gonococcal serum were also used. It took five weeks to recover. "Butecon" was also used to treat the injured gonads. His wife's gonorrhea was also cured in a short period of time by me instructing her to use "Kerlinong" as an oral preparation and "Carter Shendi's vaginal tablets" as suppositories. He had a son last year, which proves that his reproductive power has been restored.</p>

<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan</p>
<p>...There are also those who regard masturbation as entertainment...Joke...There are especially many who regard nocturnal emission as a normal thing...Strange talk</p>
<p>Whether you are an old or young reader, I believe you must all have or have committed a secret. To be honest: people in adolescence will all be addicted to masturbation, but the number of times is just more or less. Dr. Shigeru Nagahama of Japan said: 90% of men commit masturbation during adolescence. Undoubtedly, the symptoms that come with masturbation are seminal emission and kidney deficiency.</p>
<p>However, many people who have no medical knowledge regard masturbation and seminal emission as a kind of entertainment, which is really forgetting one's ancestors and not knowing anything about human affairs!</p>
<p>As for the treatment of seminal emission, it should be treated both internally and externally. And spiritual recuperation is especially important. Things like bathing in hot springs, irrigating the private parts with cold water, irradiating with sunlight, sufficient indoor air, and slightly thin and soft clothes and quilts are all very important.</p>
<p>In addition, seminal emission patients constantly deplete semen, resulting in a lack of hormones, and symptoms such as sexual weakness and spermatorrhea appear one after another. According to Dr. 's research, seminal emission should be mainly treated with "Niles seminal emission tablets". This medicine can astringent the vas deferens and calm the sexual nerves, so the desire will naturally decrease, masturbation can be eliminated, and seminal emission can be cured. "Niles seminal emission tablets" have a particularly strong effect in treating seminal emission, which cannot be compared with other preparations. All seminal emission, and weakness caused by excessive sexual activity should be taken this medicine, which can be completely cured in a short period of time. If seminal emission has been going on for too long, the body is weak, the brain is weak, insomnia, kidney atrophy, etc., then "Butecon" should be taken internally at the same time!</p>

<p>The following medicines have all been designated by doctors who have graduated from domestic and foreign medical universities. Be sure to recognize the names of each medicine when buying tofu brain! Do not blindly believe in what others say and buy miscellaneous and inferior medicines, so as to avoid causing danger after taking them.</p>
<p>Burning sensation in the stomach</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Shaolin asked: This summer, I ate too much water, which caused my appetite to become dull. Later, I felt a burning sensation in my chest and pain in my stomach. I often feel nauseous and afraid of rice. May I ask what medicine is most effective?</p>
<p>Answer: This is chronic gastritis, you should take "Qiangweijing" to improve your appetite, increase digestion, and transform the function of the gastric mucosa, then all kinds of stomach problems can be completely cured.</p>
<p>Cough and vomiting</p>
<p>Mr. Dai Yifu from Ningbo wrote: I accidentally caught a cold. It became a long cough, with a lot of white phlegm, sometimes foamy. Severe coughs cause insomnia at night, loss of appetite, frequent vomiting, belching and acid reflux, constipation, and a lot of farts. After buying and taking "Bufeinaer" to eliminate phlegm and cough, and taking "Qiangweijing" to treat stomach problems, he was quickly completely cured.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Japanese Preparation for Negotiations <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>According to recent telegraph dispatches, how to break through the deadlock in Sino-Japanese negotiations is attracting attention from all parties. However, it is currently believed that the parties are still in the meeting and consultation stage. As generally observed, the Japanese side is now gathering a large number of key members to discuss the tactics for conducting the negotiations. We are not diplomats by nature, so we naturally do not understand what is meant by diplomatic tactics, let alone the methods of diplomatic tactics. However, what we do know is that since Ambassador Kawagoe arrived in Beijing to negotiate the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations with our country's authorities, we have only seen one negotiation that failed to reach a consensus, and then Kuwashima came to China with new instructions from the Japanese side. Then, we saw a second negotiation that still failed to reach a consensus, so Suma returned to his country, also bringing so-called new instructions. But what are these two sets of new instructions? What is the situation of their negotiations? To what extent have they negotiated, and how? We are still lost in a fog, completely baffled.</p>
<p>We only know that the Japanese side has two original diplomatic policies: one is "dual diplomacy" and the other is "diplomatic unification." The so-called "dual diplomacy" and "diplomatic unification" are nothing more than a combination of soft and hard tactics, a simultaneous application of firmness and flexibility. In plain language, it is simply a fist and a candy, a combination of kindness and power. Looking at the current diplomatic situation of the Japanese side, it is truly strange. On the one hand, they send Kawagoe to Beijing to conduct "consultative" negotiations with our country's authorities, while on the other hand, alarming news is coming from the north every day. One report says that rioters took advantage of Japanese military exercises to attempt to cause trouble, so Tianjin is under special martial law. Another report says that the Japanese side conducted a large-scale exercise for a week in the Ping-Lu area, with a large number of Japanese soldiers marching through the city of Ping. Another report says that the Japanese side arbitrarily dispatched police and set up posts in the Ping-Jin area. Another report says that a certain party is actively invading westward, and Suiyuan is in imminent danger. Is this Sino-Japanese negotiation ultimately intended to proceed in a peaceful negotiation manner? Or is it intended to proceed in a reckless manner without peace? Assuming that it is intended to proceed in a peaceful negotiation manner, then while the two sides are negotiating and have not yet reached a breaking point, there should not be any arbitrary reckless actions in the Ping-Jin area. Assuming that it is intended to proceed in a reckless manner without peace, then the two sides do not need to engage in any more consultative negotiations. Any diplomat or non-diplomat can understand this basic common sense.</p>
<p>Therefore, our diplomacy, relying solely on consultative negotiations, is still not enough. We should also use dual diplomatic tactics like the Japanese. Because they use dual diplomatic tactics, we should also use dual diplomatic tactics to be correct. Otherwise, diplomatic negotiations will continue to drag on day after day, while the situation in North China will become more and more tense day after day. In the end, we will still have to say that it is an accomplished fact, and any rejection or denial on our part will be a belated effort. Is this situation a good approach to diplomatic tactics? Furthermore, a certain Japanese news agency stated the other day that the general public is quite resentful of the delay in Sino-Japanese negotiations. It is not known whether this statement is ironic. However, looking at the current situation, delay can also be said to be a type of diplomatic tactic. Therefore, the authorities must pay serious attention to this point and not neglect it.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Piracy and Prohibition <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xuelian</p>
<p>According to news reports, a dispatch from Beiping stated: "The Hebei-Chahar authorities believe that 'Guo Moruo's Collected Works contain references to the divorce of the ancient sage Mencius and the issue of Confucius eating, both of which are disrespectful. The Political Committee has ordered all its subordinate agencies to investigate and ban the book from being sold in the market. In the future, all books that insult Confucius and Mencius will be banned from sale.'" Two days later, the Shen Bao also published a news item about "unscrupulous booksellers reprinting Lu Xun's posthumous works." These two news reports happened to coincide, which is undoubtedly worthy of our attention. Mr. Lu Xun and Mr. Guo Moruo are both literary giants who are greatly admired by the public, and now one person's works are actually "banned" and the other person's works are "stolen" (pirated). As those of us who care about cultural undertakings, we cannot help but feel a sense of indignation.</p>
<p>We have not seen Mr. Guo Moruo's Collected Works in the market, and I suspect that it is also close to being a pirated edition. Mr. Guo has been living in exile overseas in recent years, and I don't know how many of his works have been "stolen" and "plundered." This can sometimes be heard in Guo's articles and speeches. If it is really a pirated edition, then the "ban" by the Hebei-Chahar authorities is not without its benefits in terms of the author's interests. At least it can strike a blow against "unscrupulous booksellers"! The pity is that the "ban" by the Hebei-Chahar authorities is not for the sake of upholding culture, but because it contains "disrespectful" references to "Confucius and Mencius," and thus a general order was issued to ban sales. Naturally, in the current era of rising retrogressive fervor, considering "disrespect" to Confucius and Mencius as a crime is exactly what one would expect. However, the current situation in North China is so tense, and the authorities do not attend to more serious national affairs, but instead insist on arguing about "Mencius's divorce" and "Confucius's eating" problems, which seems a bit inappropriate. Moreover, Guo's articles are not based on fabrication, but have ancient books as their basis. Judging from this ban on sales, not only does it make one feel that there is no freedom of speech at present, but it also seems that the Hebei-Chahar authorities are somewhat "meddlesome"!</p>
<p>As far as we know, Guo's articles are two historical essays. Many people have been writing historical essays recently, and Mr. Lu Xun is one of them. If Guo's Collected Works are "banned," then I think Lu's "Old Tales Retold" will undoubtedly suffer the same fate. Coincidentally, Lu Xun's Collected Works had already been pirated by "unscrupulous booksellers" before they were banned. "Disrespecting ancient sages" is not just Guo's doing, Lu's is also much the same. If the authorities "love the ancients far more than the present," then Lu Xun's death can be said to have been well deserved—however, we cannot help but feel grief and pain.</p>

<p>They stared with stagnant eyes, greedily eyeing the fully loaded customers brought from the station, as if not moved by their chicken-like shouts. They jealously and attentively watched these vehicles, one long string after another, pulling west, pulling towards the newly reclaimed land, Xidi, Huangsha, and gone.</p>
<p>This section of the ten-mile-long embankment, with the Haizhu Iron Bridge forming a very distinct boundary line, the lively night market west of the bridge is giving the aging Dongdi a very vicious satire. The night market on this side is also two worlds. On the north side are large buildings. In addition to the two towering foreign buildings of the Sincere Company and the Sun Sun Company, all kinds of lively taverns, movie theaters, Cantonese opera theaters, and various styles are all available. The electric lights and neon lights are intensely hurting people's eyes. People? Whether gentlemen in well-tailored suits, ladies on the list of suppression (Note 2), or people of middle class and above, are all crowded into a long line, like fish on a skewer, never ceasing. At this time, it is already the active time of the night.</p>
<p>On the sea side, that is another night world.</p>
<p>The embankment that has been planned for quite some time has been completed by seven or eight tenths. Many foreign buildings have also been built, but it seems that some open space must be left to develop this night world, so that this place called the newly reclaimed land can accommodate the gathering of the nine sects and three streams.</p>
<p>Here, the light of kerosene lamps and Meifu lamps reflects a mysterious world. Here, there are many temporary stalls: there are "philosophers" who have been driven out of the City God Temple, scholars, and book stalls specializing in "little books" and erotic pictures. There are fish porridge stalls that have moved a broken boat to be a living sign. There are herbal tea stalls that knock on tortoise shells and shout loudly. There are brave warriors who sell martial arts in the arena, and there are also magicians who perform magic tricks. There are treasures selling "thunder-struck medicine." There are also storytellers who are good at attracting people… In this way, people are connected in a series, shuttling back and forth.</p>
<p>On the edge of the embankment, outside is the Pearl River of "Pearl River Night Moon."</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>The flower boats moored by the shore are chained together as if they were doing exercises. Some boat heads have one or two boat prostitutes standing in their underwear: some are covered with curtains, and the mysterious lights and sensational laughter fluctuate, causing the boats to move. Three or five people with their eyes squinted into a line are tiptoeing there, their hearts pounding. In the dark places, groups of women, with high-pitched voices, call out as if they are嬌滴滴：</p>
<p>"Call a boat, hey! Take a river tour! Call a prostitute for the night!…"</p>
<p>(Note 1) A prostitute who has not been doing business for long. (Note 2) There was once a prevailing trend of suppressing strange costumes here, but later it was taken but not suppressed.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Fishing Tax <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Fu</p>
<p>——Old History Newly Compiled—— The sun in June hung high in the sky, its rays shining like raging fire, scorching the fields, the river… The whole earth was simply like an iron pot on fire.</p>
<p>Heaven had sent down a little rain ten days ago, but until now, not a single drop had fallen again. The sky was clear and bright, with not a single cloud in sight.</p>
<p>The rice in the fields had all withered from the scorching, and the water in the river channel was about to dry up. The small ponds had long faced the sky, with many dried dead fish and shrimp stuck to the edges, emitting bursts of fishy stench under the sunlight.…………</p>
<p>The fishing boats at Sanjiang Estuary were now stranded on the shallow shore one by one. The fishermen had no fish to catch and had stopped working.</p>
<p>"This murderous year! If it doesn't rain again and the fierce drought presses down on the world, good heavens! Then we poor people will be in big trouble!…"</p>
<p>The fishermen pointed to the sky and gestured on the ground, clamoring amidst tears and wails. Even the sixty-year-old man, Xiao En, kept looking at the clear blue sky, roaring and complaining.</p>
<p>It had been half a full month since there had been any rain.</p>
<p>But in these past two weeks, the Ding family had not relaxed their fishing tax on the fishermen because of the drought. They had sent the old servant Wu Min along with three or four strong men to the river to urge them to pay.</p>
<p>"…You bunch of dogs! Who dares not pay the fishing tax? Does anyone dare to boldly resist the Ding family's rules?… Who is leading the way! Hey, damn fellows!…"</p>
<p>The old servant Wu, relying on the power of the Ding family, wore an iron-blue face everywhere, raised his sparse whiskers, his eyes as big as wine glasses, grumbling with anger and curses as he came to Xiao En's boat.</p>
<p>Xiao En was sitting silently on the boat. At this moment, he stood up and pointed to the dry river channel, saying to him:</p>
<p>"Sir, please take a look! This kind of river channel… Where can we fishermen find a living!… The small fish are all dead, and the big ones have long swam into the big river. Fishing tax, we are not resisting the Ding family's rules, but really… really we have no way to think!…"</p>
<p>"No way to think? Are you Xiao the old head setting it up?" Old servant Wu turned his head to look at Xiao En, his eyes bathing in blood. "Sir! The facts are in front of us, it's not just me, Xiao, who is advocating this… This time, I trouble you to report back to your family's master, and wait for us to pay the tax next year. If the year is better next year, we will add interest, that would be good!…" Xiao En was very energetic, with a face full of smiles as he greeted him, rolling a lot of words from his dry lips under his two white beards, begging Wu old servant bitterly.</p>
<p>"Bah! Bold fellows!… Don't dawdle, first take you old dog to the Ding family to await disposal…"</p>
<p>Saying that: Wu old servant darted forward and grabbed Xiao En, and then the few men behind him also crowded up together.</p>
<p>But Xiao En was really angry. He calmed down and waved his two powerful fists to resist.</p>
<p>The shouting was as noisy as a collapsing wall. However, without him taking action, the strong men fell to the ground one by one like scallions and garlic, and Wu old servant was trampled under his feet.</p>
<p>Xiao daughter Guan Ying was in the back of the cabin. Hearing the sound on the shore, she hurriedly climbed out of the cabin, went ashore to stop her father's fists and feet, and pulled Wu old servant up from under her feet with one hand. But the few men who had been knocked down were now dazed, panting heavily…</p>
<p>"It's turned upside down! Xiao old dog has turned upside down!… Okay, go back and tell the master, tomorrow come and arrest you for disposition in court…"</p>
<p>Wu old servant held his own head, saying while beckoning to the group of defeated crickets-like men, all scurrying into the cracked fields.</p>
<p>Xiao En wiped the dust on his clothes, looking at the backs of their group, emitting a burst of indifferent ridicule…</p>
<p>The next day, at noon, the sun was still hanging high in the sky, just like yesterday. The fishermen along the dry river channel at Sanjiang Estuary all heard the news and gathered.</p>
<p>They all seemed to have forgotten that it was hot weather, exposing their bare bodies to the scorching sun, listening to Xiao En standing on the bow of the boat and saying loudly:</p>
<p>"Uh! We don't want to pay fishing tax anymore! Whoever pays is a traitor to us all!…" He said energetically, while raising his clenched fist, pretending to be full of remaining anger.</p>
<p>"Uncle Suo's words are right!"</p>
<p>"…That's right! We all have to act accordingly!"</p>
<p>The fishermen also clenched their fists, raising their dark arms that had been exposed to the sun like tree bark, expressing great sympathy and support…</p>
<p>Guan Ying leaned beside her father, wanting to speak several times, but she was a little shy, and still timidly lowered her head and fiddled with her clothes.</p>
<p>This time - she really couldn't bear the anger in her heart, and finally rushed to say:</p>
<p>"…Things have come to this point, we must make a decision!… You think, this is a public river channel, why should we fishermen use our sweat and blood to pay respects to the Ding family. We were stupid before!… Taking advantage of everyone being united, let's abolish this harsh tax… " After she finished speaking, a layer of bright red blush could not help but appear on her cheeks…</p>
<p>At this time, everyone's hearts had firmly embraced a great will.</p>

I regret that I should not have embraced the pipa and married another. However, do not ask about the defeated willow and withered flowers. It is only because the blessings from a previous life were not fully cultivated. This time, we meet again in the old place. How could I be willing to erase the past affection with one stroke. I think of you, there are many beautiful women in the world. They are all gently playing the zither and drum. Not like me, a bitter plum by the roadside for people to pluck. I am left to face the wind and rain. Only the county magistrate said, forgive me. Accompanying you to Hangzhou. However, the general's power is boundless. How can I leave without saying goodbye. Even if I can hide for a while. I am afraid that it will be difficult to escape to the ends of the earth. Therefore, I found it difficult to answer for a while. I did not realize that my face was blushing with red. I took out a check to repay you. Doubling the amount for you. Who knew that he tore them into pieces like butterflies. Flying up to the clouds and not leaving. Therefore, I went home in a洋卓, with worries in my heart.</p>

<p>The Western Palace is quiet at night with the fragrance of a hundred flowers. Wanting to roll up the bead curtain, the spring hate is long. The favorite concubine sits alone on the agarwood couch. Burning red candles waiting for the king. Gao Lishi. He said to the concubine. Tonight, His Majesty will visit Zhaoyang. Tai Zhen heard and added sorrow. Lazily goes to remove her palace makeup. Falling asleep in her clothes on the鴛衾. Seeing a round of bright moon shining on the palace wall. Lonely cold pillow and sad sleep. A burst of heartache, two lines of tears. Advise people not to accompany the king. Accompanying the king is like accompanying a tiger. Think of how beautiful the empress is. Why did you leave me by the side? It is better. Marry a romantic man. Enjoying happiness morning and night. The crape myrtle flower faces the crape myrtle man.</p>

<p>Yuan Chang (1120) Midnight 0:45 to 1:30 Rich and Poor New Opening Chapter (Meimei Collection Founding Issue) We are all born of ten months of pregnancy. The eldest is extremely fair. Who knows that the social situation changes. Dividing into rich and poor, weighing and lightening. The rich have unlimited wealth that is difficult to calculate. Gold, silver, and jewelry fill the boxes. High halls and big houses are countless. Calling妓 to cook food and drink. Buying good fields to collect rent. Ignoring the bankruptcy of the countryside, wanting to use knives and soldiers. The noble are powerful and oppress people extremely. The public reason is completely disregarded. Never thinking that the ice mountain is difficult to last for long. The family property will be sacrificed in the future. The most miserable common people's situation is extremely poor. Appealing is useless and silent. Trying hard to maintain and exhaust their heart. It is pitiful that they have land but cannot cultivate it. Some fail and suddenly have suicidal thoughts. Hanging themselves and throwing themselves into the water. I think that Confucius of Nishan is unparalleled. He said that equality has no poverty, and its meaning is very clear. It is a pity that no one follows this. Causing the division of classes, humiliation, and glory. In the future, after equality and freedom. Treating everyone equally like brothers. Then we can see the sea and the universe disappear.</p>

<p>Premieres Today at the Grand Cathay</p>
<p>The long-awaited colorful literary blockbuster "Ramona" premieres today at the Grand Cathay. The film tells the story of a young woman, Ramona, of mixed race. Although a white man is in love with her, his mother opposes the marriage, making it impossible. Ramona soon marries an Indian with a sense of responsibility and goes with him to the Indian settlement, where they farm and live. The following year, they have a daughter and are very happy. Unfortunately, their land is suddenly confiscated by the American government. They have no power to resist, so they have to go to the mountains to find another way to make a living. Later, due to wind and rain, the child falls ill and they take shelter in the home of a white woman. Ramona's husband rides to town to hire a doctor, but instead of finding a doctor, he is killed for riding a white man's horse. Ramona becomes a homeless woman. The white man who loved her before hears the news and comes to find her. When they meet, she looks back on the past and cannot help but burst into tears, falling into his arms. With Loretta Young's graceful and charming demeanor, she is of course very suitable for the role of Ramona. The other supporting actors also give strong performances. The film's color is also exquisite, bringing the beautiful scenery and bright sunshine of California to the screen, captivating the audience.</p>
