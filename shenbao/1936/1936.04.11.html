<p>遠東方面亦如銅山東崩洛鐘西應蒙邊之警訊頻傳遠東之風雲益亟最近蘇蒙成立恊定以反抗第三者之侵略同時日德軍事同盟之聲浪甚囂塵上日關東軍機關報滿洲每日新聞且言之不諱此東西兩大軍國主義國家之結合尤不容吾人忽視者也</p>
<p>日德軍事密約之說喧傳已久倫敦人士言之鑿鑿謂以共同對俄爲主要目標二月末旬倫敦金融界且傳出日德兩國現正在荷蘭京城進行談判磋商蒙古境內兩國經濟合作問題共目的係就蒙古境內建造鐵道事業劃分兩國勢力範圍德國中央銀行及克虜伯蒂遜兩大工廠均與聞共事此外又有可注意者卽過去不久德國經濟調查團團長克樸在東京與日方進行商務關係之談判其所負之實際使命如何局外人尙難預測密勒氏評論報則又載有德國將爲中日間之調解人藉使中日關係好轉之消息準是以觀日德兩國訂結軍事同盟殆有極大之可能性惟正式宣佈或尙有待耳</p>
<p>日德軍事同盟之效果如何依吾人觀測在德國方而則可因日本之遙相應援加强其對羅卡諾公約簽字國之反對態度而使凡爾賽體系集體安全制度趨於崩潰同時在日本方面則可因此項同盟之作用擴大共遠東反俄之力量並促進英國之反省使英國爲保持其在遠東勢力不得不與日本接近是則日德同盟固不僅足以助長兩國之聲勢且對世界整個局勢亦有莫大之影響也</p>
<p>最近日本在束亞大陸之行動國社黨份子在東歐之活躍希特勒表示無意收回日代管德舊殖民地之宣言均足顯示兩國步調之一致日德同盟之計晝可謂已達瓜熟蒂圓之程度矣此項同盟所可引起之國際的動亂斷不能復容吾人有片刻之苟安瞻望前途我民族生存之正路惟有以最大之努力謀國力之充實與外交機能之健全而已</p>
<h3>非常時期財政問題</h3>
<p>國內經濟學者各抒所見　馬寅初仍主開辦所得稅</p>
<p>（南京）非常時期財政問題、自經濟專家馬寅初發表應以開辦所得稅爲國庫主要收入、必要時再作有限制之通貨膨脹、及發少數公債以彌補之主張後、國內經濟學者均甚注意、僉以馬氏鑒於德國戰時紙幣政策之慘痛敎訓、不主張我國亦採行紙幣政策、確爲復員時期保證國家經濟基礎之要圖、否則國內資金悉數消滅、幾十百年不易恢復也、惟所得稅我國尙未舉辦、卽使政府立卽開征、稅收能否如我人所期望、則大多表示懷疑、以記者所知、有主張以整理財政、以充實非常時期財政收入者、亦有主張徵發民財以紓國難者、更有主張以開辦土地增値稅、加征娛樂捐奢侈稅、印花稅、郵資及勸募捐欵以裕國庫者、記者以此事乃當前國人急欲解决之問題、用舉以上所知、再請益於馬氏、籍作學理探討、據其表示、對以上各種辦法均可贊成、惟土地增値稅、收入有限、德國初辦時卽如此、且屬於地方收入、英國之土地增値稅與印花稅收入在戰事期內、反比戰前减少、徵發民財、祇可於國民愛國熱忱極高時爲之、其他娛樂捐及戰爭贏利稅等、雖爲數有限、然集腋成裘、不無小補、至整理財政則在平時早應爲之、幷非非常時期之緊急辦法、此外如再有利於國家之合理合法收入、亦無不歡迎各方發紓偉見、以收衆志成城之效、馬民仍堅執應以所得稅爲非常時期主要收入、幷盼政府立卽開辦、使人民養成納所得稅之善良習慣、爲培植國家良稅基礎、萬一有限制之通貨膨脹與發少數公債、尙不足以彌補非常時期財政緊急需要、不妨利用外資、或將現有外債延期還本、未始非另一出路、（十日中央社電）</p>

<p>（日內瓦）據本社外交訪員所知、十三國委員會本日會議之後、昨日緊張局勢業有緩和之勢、此於下列兩端可以見之、　十三國委員會應英國艾登外相之請、分向意阿兩國發出申請、勸其勿再使用違背人道之作戰方式、此屬英國方面頗感滿意、　艾登外相曾在十三國委員會中聲稱、不論侵略行為發生於何處、英國必當不稍躊躇、而要求將國聯會盟約各項規定、全部實施、一如其對於意阿爭端所為者、此在法國代表團方面亦甚歡迎云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>十三國秘密會議　主席報告……　與意阿代表接洽情形</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯會行政院十三國委員會頃於今晨十一時半舉行秘密會議、歷兩小時始畢、主席瑪達里亞伽當就渠與阿國代表華特意國代表阿洛錫會商結果提出報告云、　阿國現仍準備與意國開始議和、但以渠與國聯會秘書長愛文諾參加談判、　意國首相墨索里尼昨曾邀請瑪達里亞伽前往羅馬當面接洽、或俟至復活節之後、再行派遣代表前來日內瓦、現仍保持此項見解、瑪達里亞伽幷謂、現當於下星期二日與意國代表再度會晤、而於下星期四日召集十三國委員會賡續開會、英國外相艾登當即起立發言云、意阿兩國議和談話、若果開始進行、則十三國委員會仍當賡續開會、不稍間斷、俾克贊助瑪達里亞伽與愛文諾、幷注視談話發展情形、瑪達里亞伽對於艾登此項意見表示贊同、幷謂十三國委員會茍不予以支持、則無法主持意阿談判、法國外長佛蘭亭乃表示異議云、十三國委員會已於三月三日通過決議案、要求意阿兩當事國直接進行談判、此際自無須賡續開會、但可由主席瑪達里亞伽隨時召集開會云、（是日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）國聯會行政院十三國委員會主席瑪達里亞伽、本日曾與意國代表阿洛錫會晤、詢以意國是否準備停止戰事、關於此層、半官式人士頃聲明阿洛錫所奉使命、僅為注視羅卡諾二次會議進行情形、對於瑪達里亞伽所提問題、自無權代表政府提出答復也、至就意阿兩國和議談判而諭、意國從未表示反對、且曾承諾一俟耶穌復活節後、即當派遣代表前往日內瓦討論此事、幷曾邀請瑪達里亞伽來意、俾與首相墨索里尼直接交換意見、無如兩項建議均被拒絕、故此際十三國委員會之工作、其目的無非在攪亂談判形勢、幷阻撓意軍之勝利而已、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）法國佛蘭亭外長、頃與意國代表阿洛錫舉行談話、當由阿洛錫說明意國確已準備開始和議談判、又謂意相墨索里尼曾邀十三國委員會主席瑪達里亞伽前往羅馬當面接洽、幷曾於答復瑪達里亞伽函中、聲言一俟耶穌復活節後、即派代表來日內瓦、討論議和問題、以上兩項建議、雖均未如願、而十三國委員會即已開會、惟意國現仍維持原議云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>籲請作戰勿背人道　意運菲毒瓦斯達二百噸</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）十三國委員會會議考慮立即開始意阿　和談判之方法者、昨日草定電文、　請意阿兩國生命拂用瓦斯或達姆達姆槍彈作戰、或以其他行為違反人類戰爭法律後、即延會至今晨十一時、英外相艾登曾提議當向意阿兩國莊嚴　請聲明此後不再施用瓦斯、此事非高級指揮或空軍權力所能及、蓋唯政府得許施用瓦斯、吾人由耶穌彝士運河意國貨船之艙單查悉、運往阿比西尼亞陣綫之瓦斯、在二百噸以上、今最要之事、厥為使意人明白决不能以在菲洲之故、而　可施用此物、此種見解絕對無理、英政府殊不為然云、艾登宣述畢、委員會乃决議草擬電文致意阿兩國政府、（是日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）十三國委員會傾向意國與阿比西尼亞發出申請書、其原文業由國聯會秘書廳發表、略謂「阿意兩國政府向國聯會秘書長愛文諾所提各項文件、即關於雙方作戰方式違反國際現行恊定者、均由本委員會加以審閱、本委員會茲將代表　情、申請兩交戰國務必採取一切措置、俾使違反國際恊定及國際公法原則之情事毋再發生、深望兩國政府提出保證、以釋懸念」云云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（日內瓦）比國內閣總理齊蘭業已啟程來此、預計明晨可以抵達、羅卡諾二次會議當於明日午後舉行、屆時意國代表阿洛錫僅以觀察員資格列席會議、一般人相信意相墨索里尼始終以為對意制裁辦法一日不取銷、則該國對於羅卡諾恊定草案、即一日不予批准也、本社外交訪員頃探悉法國外長佛蘭亭將在羅卡諾二次會議席上、說明德國若果違反凡爾賽條約第四十二條、而在萊茵河區域建造防禦工事、則法國政府對於一切可採之步驟、不論為集體者或為片面者、當保留自由行動之權、此在英國外相艾登則江說明對德談判尙未終了、故英國對於談判失敗之各種後果、此際尙未能加以考慮、英法兩國見解參差、大抵如此、比國齊蘭總理或將斡旋兩者之間、俾得折衷調和云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>希特勒將進一步　要求收回舊殖民地　準備開始積極外交行動　德專使向英曾有所表示</h3>
<p>（柏林）今日據可靠消息、德國已開始外交行動、以期恢復原有殖民地、希特勒元首專使里　特洛浦近在倫敦與英國外相艾登談話時、聞曾提出此項要求、此間官方對此雖不願發表意見、但希特勒則已預定進行步驟矣、（九日國民電）</p>
<h3>萊茵德如設防　法决自由行動　對英作口頭警告</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）今日據負責方面消息、法國外長佛蘭亭已口頭警告英外相艾登、謂德如在萊茵設防、則法决採取有效行動對付之、法德僵局因之益趨嚴重、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）法國外交部長佛蘭亭昨曾以機密照會一件、面致英國外相艾登、該國大使戈爾平頃以同樣照會送達外次汪西泰爵士、據一般人所知、其內容乃謂對德成立妥恊之企圖、頃已歸於失敗、則關係各國依照羅卡諾恊定所當採取各項强制性質之措置、自當立即付諸實施、此在關係各國决定照辦之前、雖可暫緩實行、但關係各國仍當立即接收此議、並開始進行談判、反之、德國若果在萊茵河區域建造防禦工事、則暫緩實行之議、亦即為之失效、此外法國對於法德兩國所提出之和平計劃、除德國計劃關於西歐安全一部份而外、並主張提付國聯會行政院加以討論、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法國和平方案　德匈輿論之一斑</h3>
<p>（柏林）半官式政治外交通信報、頃評論法國備忘錄云、「法國和平計畫所提各項主張、尤其是集體安全·互助軍縮·經濟合作各項主張、若能在順利情形之下、予以實施、其他各國原可加以贊同、所不可知者、其範圍係以歐洲大陸為限、抑當包括地中海沿岸各國在內也、至以蘇聯而論、其國體雖屬單純統一制、其國土雖無歐亞之分、但以吾人所見、則歐洲疆界、當以蘇聯西部邊境為終點」云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（維也納）泛歐洲聯合會主席加萊基伯爵、（匈牙利人）頃在該會機關報「泛歐洲通信報」發表一文、對於法國所提之歐洲建設計畫、有所論列、略謂法國計畫、並無樹立霸權之念存於其間、關於殖民地一項問題、尤能以良好之瞻望、給予全歐洲、（按法國計畫、主張殖民地富源之分配、宜加以改正、俾歐洲各國均可獲得必要之原料）、此項計畫、若能實現、則菲洲一隅、原為羣雄角逐之場者、一變而成為國際合作之因素、此其關係重大、安可勝計、惟是法國計畫、對於少數民族問題、略而不談、亦一缺憾、按紙法國所提主張、現行疆界、須由關係各國互相同意、始可加以變更、而在二十五年之內、不得要求加以變更、此在匈國視之、未免過於遼遠、蓋由此際以至二十五年各少數民族、誠有被人童話之虞也」云云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英國會　休會度復活節　至本月二十一日再開　對外政策曾一度激辯</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英下院對於意阿戰爭有激昂辯論後、今日因耶穌復活節休會、至四月二十一日政府提預算案時再行集議、法國對於制裁等事之態度、及意國作戰之方法、頗為下院所抨　、外交次官克蘭本對於東菲意軍首用毒瓦斯之說、亦不否認之、並謂英政府以為此種嚴重責言如果屬事實、則將發生極重要問題、因與有關係者為全體人類及整個文化前途、不僅阿國已也、對於意阿兩國而發之其他責言、亦必加以調查云、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據政界人士推測、內閣閣員將在今後數星期中、分裂為兩派、互相對立一派年事較輕、均擁財相張伯倫為領袖、而其對外政策較為積極者、一派則為老成持重之輩、對於外交政策所採態度較為溫和、此在國會人士亦謂、內閣所處地位因受外交局勢之影響、現已趨入緊急關頭、此項局勢最重要者、自為羅卡諾案與意阿爭端兩項問題、就羅卡諾一案而論、此際英國以為對德談判尙未終了、故艾登外相若果逾越參謀部談話之範圍、而在政治上採取約束、質言之、外相若果承認德國一旦違反凡爾賽和約第四十二條、（指在萊茵河區域建造防禦工事而言）即可對德實施制裁、則必難獲得內閣全體同僚之贊助、或將如去年霍爾前外相之掛冠而去、亦未可知、但若對德妥恊努力卒告失敗、則英國政府將不得不採取較切實之態度、此層自當別論也、就意阿爭端而論、此際意軍　欲取獲最後勝利、恐非加緊制裁如禁運煤油辦法之類所得而阻止、果爾、英國是否承認加緊制裁徒勞無益而逕予放棄、抑或要求實施軍事制裁、此則問題癥結所在也、惟英國方面深知軍事制裁一旦實施、必與意國發生衝突、屆時意國自與德國聯合、二次歐戰必不崇朝而爆發、因此政界要人以為英國政府對於干涉大陸事件之政策或將放棄、而暫時採取孤立態度云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>藝術漫談</p>
<h3>赤欄橋外柳千條（上）</h3>
<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>日麗風和的一個下午，獨自在西湖邊上彷徨。暫時忘記了時間，忘記了地點，甚至忘了自身，而放眼觀看目前的春色，但見綠柳千條，映着紅橋一帶，好一片動人的光景！古人詩云：「赤欄橋外柳千條，」昔日我常嘆賞牠為描寫春景的佳句，今日看見了牠的實景，嘆賞的愈加熱烈了。但是，這也並非因為見了詩的實景之故，只因我忘記了時間，忘記了地點，甚至忘記了自身，所見的就是詩人的所見；換言之，實景就是詩，所以我的嘆賞能愈加熱烈起來。不然，凶惡的時代消息瀰漫在世界的各處，國難的紀念碑立在西湖的彼岸，也許還有人類的罪惡充塞在赤欄橋畔的汽車裏，柳陰深處的樓臺中，世間有甚麼值得嘆賞呢？從前的雅人歡喜管領湖山，常自稱為「西湖長」，「西湖主」。做了長，做了主，那裏還看得見美景？恐怕他們還不如我一個西湖上的彷徨者，能夠忘懷一切，看見湖上的畫意詩情呢？</p>
<p>但是，忘懷一切，到底是拖着肉體的人所難以持久的事。「赤欄干外柳千條」之美，只能在一瞬間使我陶醉，其次的瞬間就把我的思想拉到藝術問題上去。紅配着綠，何以能使人感到美滿？細細咀嚼這個小問題，彷徨中的心也算有了一個着落。</p>
<p>據美學者說，色彩都有象徵力，能作用於人心。人的實際生活上，處處盛用着色彩的象徵力。現在讓我先把紅綠兩色的用例分別想一想看：據說紅象徵性愛，故關於性的曰「桃色」。紅象徵婚姻，故俗稱婚喪事曰「紅白事」。紅象徵女人，故舊稱女人曰「紅顏」，「紅妝」。女人們自己也會很巧妙地應用紅色：有的把臉孔塗紅，有的把嘴唇塗紅，有的把指爪塗紅，更有的用大紅作衣服的裏子，行動中時時閃出這種刺目的色彩來，彷彿在對人說：「我表面上雖鎮靜，內面是懷抱着火焰般的熱情的啊！」愛與結婚，總是歡　的，繁榮的。因此紅又可象徵尊榮。故俗稱富貴曰「紅」。中國人有一種特殊的脾氣：受人銀錢報謝，不歡喜明明而歡喜隱隱，不歡喜直接而歡喜間接。在這些時候，就用得着紅色的帮助，只要把銀錢用紅紙一包，即使明明地送去，直接地送去，對方看見這色彩自會欣然樂受。這可說是紅色的象徵力的一種妙用！然而紅還有相反的象徵力：在古代，殺頭犯穿紅衣服，紅是罪惡的象徵。在現代，車展上阻止火車前進用紅旗，馬路上阻止車馬前進用紅燈，紅是危險的象徵，義旗大都用紅，紅是革命的。蘇聯用紅旗，人就稱蘇聯曰「赤俄」，而謹防她來「赤化」。同是赤，為甚麼紅紙包的銀錢受人歡迎，而赤化遭人大忌呢？這裏似乎有點矛盾。但從根本上想，亦可相通：大概人類對於紅色的象徵力的認識，始終火和血。火是熱烈的，血是危險的。熱烈往往近於危險，危險往往由於熱烈。凡是熱情，生動，發達，繁榮，力强，激烈，危險，等性狀，都可由火和血所有的色彩而聯想。總之，紅是生動的象徵。</p>

<h3>津滬埠際足球賽　上海四比八慘敗</h3>
<p>上半時滬隊二比一佔先　津隊連中六球反敗為勝</p>
<p>今日滬隊戰津軍聯</p>
<p>（天津十日電）津滬埠際足球賽、十日下午四時準時在英球塲舉行、門票售二元一元五角三種、觀衆六千餘、擁擠異常、五時半賽畢、四比八滬敗、定十一日下午四時、仍在英球場舉行、滬隊與津軍聯友誼賽、十日天陰欲雨、球塲濕軟、前半時二對一、滬佔勝、後半時初時以四比二領導、嗣爲津隊翻成平局、以後則節節失利、反以四比八失敗、滬隊踢中者許文奎二隻、波賽利與福恩各一隻、津隊姜璐三隻、斯羅凱迪夫三隻、約翰森與瓊司各一隻、</p>
<p>許文奎先開紀錄　埠際足球賽登場時、滬隊氣勢殊盛、初二分鐘許文奎得戴麟經接濟、首開紀錄、二十分鐘後、鮑賽利得發來角球機會、頂入一隻、以後相持至三十五分鐘、津隊始脫厄運、由姜璐邊關橫掃中的、</p>
<p>天津隊連中六隻　下半時許文奎復於十碼處撥中一隻、未幾福恩於亂軍中射中、此際雙方肉搏甚烈、忽津隊得罰十二碼機會、斯羅凱迪夫踢中、旋姜璐頂入一隻踢中一隻、以四對五翻敗爲勝、以後滬隊悉在津方控制下、還攻機會甚少、中後衛接濟不力、斯羅凱迪夫約翰森瓊司先後射中三隻、津隊遂攫得本屆錦標、</p>
<p>阿戴談失敗原因　戴麟經談失敗原因、係場地濕潮踢來不慣、奔馳亦不獲迅速所致</p>
<h3>國體籃球隊　昨晨載譽返滬</h3>
<p>唐寳堃談征菲經過</p>
<p>中央國術館與國立體專合組之南洋旅行團、於一月十二日出國南征、至馬來亞及菲列濱等地、表演國術及比賽籃球、極受當地人士及僑胞熱烈之歡迎、尤以籃球隊屢克强隊、威震南洋、該團全體團員、於上月由張之江氏率領、啟程返國、過港稍作勾留、七日搭大來公司林肯總統號輪回滬、於八時半在新關頭登岸、前往歡迎有本市市國術館精武體育會、中華體育會暨團員親友等數十人、中央國術館並由龐玉森李滋樊李瑞堂來滬照料一切、聞全體團員在滬稍留數日、即行返京、</p>
<p>國術　據張之江氏在輪埠語國光社記者云、本人此次出國、旨在考察體育及宜揚國術、先赴美洲繼至歐洲、歷時八閱月、途經十餘國、各國體育現正猛晋不已、人民均知體育爲强國健身之本、發展殊爲平均、死亡率得以减低、實爲我國所不及、國術在南洋極爲僑胞所注意、以爲國術爲我國粹、爲他種運動所不及、故於該國表演後、推崇備至、紛紛延師敎授、學校方面並添設國術科、從此可知僑胞感應非常敏捷、對于體育興趣之濃厚矣、繼謂該團籃球隊員未及參加世運預選以致被擯、現擬與選拔當局從長計議云、</p>
<p>籃球　另據該團籃球隊隊長唐寳堃君對國光社記者談、該隊隊員抵南洋、身體與精神兩方面極爲良佳、屢次表演異常滿意、尤以至菲列濱最有價値、經騐與技術進步良多、在菲並得僑胞林夫助加入戰團、實力駿增、此君任守衛之職、並能充中鋒、球藝高强、長射凖確、國內恐無出其右、本隊能有如此戰績得此君之力非淺、至全部戰績、除見敗于聖托馬斯及提高兩隊外、均獲全勝、按該兩隊員、爲菲馬第一流名手、內中多人曾出席遠東運動會及被選參加本屆世運之選手、實力之强可想而知、然本隊尙能與之抗爭、僅負三四分、而本隊勝其餘各隊均在二三十分之多、可知勝來並非僥倖云云、（另詳本埠新聞欄）</p>
<h3>世運足球代表隊　定十五日產生　二十二日出發來滬</h3>

<h3>國體籃球隊威震菲島</h3>
<p>八戰六勝擊敗菲島世運預選隊　僑胞聞李唐世運落選甚為扼腕</p>
<p>（本報駐菲記者顏文初寄）</p>
<p>（馬尼拉特訊）中央國術館長張之江將軍、漫遊歐美、考察體育、將到南洋時、電國專學校籃球隊與國術館員、組織南遊團、預定日期到英屬新加坡相會、在新加坡籃球隊、連戰數陣皆勝、（該地土著體育不發達、並無勇健之籃球隊、祇與華僑比賽、）二星期前、與和平使者王寵惠博士、乘德輪到岷里刺、總領事領事暨各社團代表到碼頭歡迎、王博士發表談話、謂際此國難當頭、舉國應團結一致、此行純以私情促胡入京、並否認欲長外部消息、是晚即趁原輪回港、張則領導球隊與國術團、在岷勾留、由華僑籃球聯合會任招待、並與岷埠各大學接洽比賽期間、計速戰八陣、六勝兩負、茲將其成績列左、</p>
<p>觀以上戰績、雖經小挫、究不掩其摧敵鉅功、但有數點、特須提出、爲佈吿於我國內體育界者、</p>
<p>菲報稱揚　　非島籃球、歷屆遠運會、皆保持錦標、數年來我國籃球隊南征、皆勞師無功、此行主客異勢、且以孤軍南來、苦戰兼旬、而得此偉大成績、宜乎菲報十分稱揚、謂中國籃球有長足進步、而本年度全菲籃球冠軍仙米拉大學隊、SamBela　College且恐損及威名、而臨時掛起免戰牌、（本來第六場議定對仙米拉隊、該隊見仙道馬之戰勝、半由球證不公、恐損及冠軍威名、故臨時翻議）、</p>
<p>紀律甚佳　　凡屬有名運動員、恒皆放蕩形骸、以運遠運會選手、且視舞場爲球場、午夜以後、正在欲仙欲死、因欠相當休息、故隔日一臨球場、精神恍惚、前年某網球選手、（非遠運會時）本有冠軍希望、决賽時竟有出人意外之敗北、即因此弊、此回因領導者爲張之江將軍、純以軍法部署、球員及國術團員、不吸烟、不飲酒、不入跳舞場、十時即睡、五時早起訓練、全無囂張氣習、同寓靑年會之旅客、亦皆嘖嘖稱道、</p>
<p>林君客串　　此回球員來者祇六人、唐寳堃·李震中、固爲當年出席遠東健將、表演時技術花樣百出、博得中外觀者不少掌聲、其餘亦皆手脚剛健、投籃甚準、惟苦後備乏人接應、孤軍奮鬭、勞苦異常、幸中西校友籃球隊長華僑惟一籃球健將林天助、每場加入助戰、林熟識此間體育界情形、何隊何人健者、何人精何球藝、皆知之有素、故攻守皆宜、有時竟轉敗爲勝、平心論之、林勞苦功高、不在唐李下也、</p>
<p>唐李可人　　觀於此回戰勝菲島預赴世運選手、則唐李球藝、實覺可人、乃聞我國所發表預赴世運選手、唐李反因不參加而落選、僑界甚爲扼腕、聞此决主持比賽之岷里刺華僑籃聯合會、函王正廷博士、請其斟酌增加唐李二選手、俾展雄才、</p>
<p>張氏意見　　柔術爲我國數千年傳來國技、徒以門戶見深、各守秘傳、致不能普及一般、據國術館張之江館長、屢在歡迎會中發見、大槪謂、（甲）世界各國死亡率調査、最每千人口中十五、惟中國則至三十、若以四人口計算、比別國每年多死亡六百萬人、設喪葬費爲五十金、合計須三萬萬金、損失如許人口、如許經濟、由平時不知銀練身體、俾日臻康健故也、提倡國術、即欲彌補此種缺陷、（乙）最新式球類、及各項運動、須有相當場所、欲建設一體育館、多則數萬、少亦數千、現際民窮財盡、城市尙且不易籌備、何况鄉村、若國術則隨地可以練習、並無須　充分之經濟、（丙）練習新式運動、發展好身手、不過在少年黃金時代、一過中年、則無法馳騁運場中矣、若國術則老而愈精、當南京表演比賽時、有七十餘歲老翁、登台獻技、壓倒羣雄、（丁）新式運動、祇能鍜鍊體格、若國術旣精、一可當百、是不特可衛生、且可術身、（戊）新式運動、須有團體的、如網球至少亦須二人、國術則因個人之便、隨時隨地、可以練習、（已）日本之武十道、即竊取我國柔術之一部、一二八之役、當兩軍短兵肉搏、大吃大刀隊之虧、故現在以重余羅致我國拳術家、東渡敎授、彼以國力爲提倡、設我國不加以整理發展、再過三二十年、須向日人求拳術眞傳也、</p>
<p>國術表演　　每場籃球比賽後、殿以國術表演、身靈手妙、刀光劍影、提起華僑不少尙武精神、僑界中領袖若華僑敎育會會畏楊啟泰華僑中學校長蘇行前中西學校校長彼等素精是道、皆加入表演、</p>
<p>招待外賓　　總領事與中華商會、特訂期在東方俱樂部、請美菲軍政界參觀、菲副總統荷斯民邀同軍政界要人、皆屆時蒞場、觀於莫明其妙中、亦連拍掌叫好不絕、聞僑界對於國術甚感興奮、經籌備設國術分館云、</p>
<h3>第四屆　中英擊彈</h3>
<p>雙方積極凖備中　吳市長捐贈銀盃</p>
<p>第四屆中英國際擊彈賽、業在雙方積極準備之中、吳市長特捐助大銀盃一只、以示提倡、以前三屆、勝利均屬中華、故英國方面、擬召集健將、决意恢復榮譽、老將貝納爾、亦將親自出馬、中華隊人選、已在嚴密挑選、據各方傳說、大致主將一席、仍屬李公穎沈林策如能來滬、勢必出戰、其他好手如張英達·胡昌源·丁明毅·朱其良·鮑奇雲等、多在參戰之列、比賽日期、三數日後、即可决定、</p>

<p>學校調查</p>
<h3>上海英國學校概况（二）</h3>
<p>— 胡祖蔭</p>
<p>該校校舍建築甚爲莊嚴華美全部校舍資產値價五十三萬餘元·校舍有四層，有自動電梯上下，頗爲便利，普通敎室有九間，專科敎室有物理，化學實騐室，音樂室，圖畫室，圖書室，體育館，大禮堂，操場等。另有校長辦公室，敎員室，學生休息室，學生膳堂，厠所，飲水處，均屬可用。各敎室採光與通氣均好；衣帽寄存櫃多設置在敎室內。各敎室均裝水汀，以備冬日取暖。且每敎室學生人數很少，至多只有二十人；是以室中空氣常屬新鮮充足。</p>
<p>各級各科敎室設備亦稱完備，校中全部設備資產値價八萬五千餘元。敎室桌椅均用單人式，式樣新穎。物理化學實騐室，置備全副儀器及實騐材料，並有小影戲機及幻燈，放映各種科學影片及幻燈片。物理化學實騐室之間另有講堂一所，專爲上課講解之用。圖畫室另置爲圖畫用之專門桌椅。體育館設備可在我國中學中首屈一指，容在體育設施一節中詳細介紹。大禮堂雖不寬大，但甚壯麗；表演台佈置精美，兩旁玻璃窗鑲以五色玻璃，頗有英國古風。學生飯廳佈置精雅，內部桌椅及用具等均屬淸潔衛生。學生厠所分年幼學生及學學生兩處，內部全用磁磚裝置；且有自動滴臭藥水器及肥皂缸等設備。使人置身其間，嗅不出若何臭氣。</p>
<p>但是該校校舍有一點美中不足，就是地點不適宜。該校校址處在公共租界中區，而英僑居民都在公共租界西區，因此許多入學兒童多感不便。雖然該校備有公共汽車爲學生租用，但是對於年幼兒童仍然覺感困難。該校新校舍落成後本應可多收入學兒童；但因地點不適宜，學生人數仍不能激增。五年來，全校學生人數常在一百五十人左右。該校現計劃遷移西區，另圖發展；惟因種種關係，一時恐不易辦到</p>

<h3>怎樣敎養成一個良好的孩子</h3>
<p>— 陸顧文淑</p>
<p>我們誰都知道孟子是主張人性本警，荀子是主張人性本惡，不過若是依孟子的主張，那麽世界上應該都是聖人和賢人，依苟子的主張，那麽世界上的人都要成爲盜賊惡徒。而事實上却是好人也有壤人也有。這是什麽綠故呢？因爲當一個孩子脫離母胎後，遭受環境的不同，天性也就隨之而更變。環境好就好，環境壊就壊，很少有出規的。而孩子們踏到世界上遇着的第一個環境，也可說是一生最重要的環境，就是家庭。所以家庭對於孩子將來終身的成就或是失敗，是擊有莫大的關係的。我們做母親的是家庭中惟一的中堅份子，對於孩子的將來當然負有極大責任，我們須耍在他們第一個環境裏造就他們健全的身心，優越的人格，使他們將來一個個都成爲完美的公民，忠實的社會服務人。至於要講到用什麽方式來達到這目的呢？以作者的觀察大別之，可分下列幾點。</p>
<p>一·以身作則法：兒童們因爲生理關係極富倣傚性，並且因爲判斷力太幼稚的緣故，所以他們總以爲我們大人的一舉一動都是對的，合理的，因此很喜歡傚法我們。爲了這個綠故，我們應當以身作則，做好的榜樣給孩子們瞧，使他們一天到晚所看見的都是些高尙的行北；所聽見的都是些溫言良語；孩子的人格就和他的能力智慧同時並進了。反之假使我們做父母親的一天到晚打牌，抽烟，喝酒，做種種壊榜樣給他們看；這簡直是在他們潔白神聖的小心靈上，漆上一層壊的印象，危險程度是可想而知的。</p>
<p>二·鼓勵法：假使孩子們有某一點缺點，我們要想校正他們，引他們走上一條好的路徑，而他們一時或不能立刻遵行，那麽最好的辦法就是用言語或是其他來鼓勵他們，引誘他們走上這條好的途徑。這方法比什麽强迫法或是恐嚇法等都爲靈騐，因爲强迫和恐嚇法，只能對於懦弱的孩子，而且有效時期是很短促的。</p>
<p>三·懲戒法：孩子若是犯了一種過失，懲戒是不可少的。不過懲戒的方法，是要囈情形而定。若是所犯的過失是無關緊要，或是無疑犯的；那麽只須略加呵責就行了。但是假使是一件很重大或是屢犯有意的過失，那麽我們應當用嚴正的態度，重重地加以責罰，（不宜公開）使孩子們牢記着作惡是要受處罰的心理，以後再不敢再犯。同時我們最好再要施用鼓勵法，這樣我可以保證萬無一失的了。</p>
<p>敎養成良好的兒童是我們母親的天職之一，並且誰家的母親不望自己的孩子學好。所以要希望有良好孩子的母親們不妨一試。</p>
<h3>日本報紙上的婦女讀物</h3>
<p>— 一髮</p>
<p>日本女子敎育普及，婦女們在家事之餘，便以報紙及雜誌爲消遣。而日本各報都有家庭欄或婦女欄等副刋，便是爲婦女們特設的專門讀物。內容相去不遠，並無特殊的新式刋物。</p>
<p>在每個月開始的前幾天，各報婦女欄裏，都有該月份，家中的行事曆。詳述紀念日，節令，風俗習慣等。凡是新做女家主的婦女們，不難按圖索驥的。日本女子烹調洗濯，大都要自己動手，菜肴種類又少，婦女們便燒不出新奇的菜蔬，來供奉他的丈夫。這是普通日本女子認爲苦悶的事情。所以各報上，每天都有應時的烹調法，有時夾幾决中國菜如紅燒肉丸子，淸燉鯉魚之類。好在伊們在女學校裏都學過中國式的烹調，並無困難的。凡是女學校畢業出來的婦女們，至少會燒一碗蛋炒飯，我國女子或者反而耍不會做呢。</p>
<p>以一般而論，日本女子的化妝，要比我國注重。在街道上只見細目紅唇的女子，允其是臉上頸部的白粉，堆砌得粉墻一般、。就是三四十歲的半老徐娘和侍者女傭，亦莫不濃妝着。各副刋當然投其所好，時常發表各種化妝方法，對塗脂抹粉的硏究，常佔據了極大的篇幅。日本女子的化妝，大都以巴黎爲表率。駐在法國的通訊員，便要担任這種責任，把巴黎的化妝術，介紹到日本來。日本女子雖能節儉勤苦，獨對於化妝上金錢時間的耗費，要比我國更甚。不過伊們所用的化妝材料，如花粉胭脂香水等都是國貨，並不以用外國貨爲榮的。</p>
<p>女子和兒童的衣服，也是婦女最注意的。兒童的衣服，趨向於西式，製法簡單，均能自已製作。婦女們的衣服，除有時介紹西洋流行的服裝照片之外，便是介紹新出的衣料和用品，不啻大公司的義務廣吿。日本女子的地位，或我國從前舊式女子相近，故只注意於家事和個人的裝飾敎養保育之外，便不需要旁的東西。所以各報上對於婦女問題的討論　　，可　是絕無僅有的。</p>
<p>某報婦女欄內有讀者信箱，以應答各種質問。凡是對女子被丈夫遺棄，或是丈夫不顧膽養，以及女子欲脫離家庭，拋了子女，自己營生等事情，編者總是勸着人家忍耐，以丈夫的家庭子女爲重，勿只注意於個人的幸福。在字裏行間，便可推測到婦女讀物編者的對日本女子的認識了。最近某報逐日登載東京少女，在路人或電車裏，被男學生老紳士等當衆調笑的醜態，確是有意義的。共他如美滿家庭的介紹，職業勞働女子的褒獎，也很切實而使贖者歡迎的。</p>
<h3>蘇州的女轎夫</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>凡是遊過蘇州各山，如天平　岩等等的，大致都對於在他處所不易經見的女轎夫，留着一個深刻的印象。更其是對於素以柔懦著名的蘇州娘兒們，居然在肩頭上，荷上了重負，而爬出越嶺，如履平地，當無不咋舌騖奇。</p>
<p>的確，蘇州鄉下的女轎夫，是値得一爲的。每一個女轎夫，都有栗色的膚色，都市中人的所謂朱古力色，或是咖啡色，或是日晒色。腿和臂，是挺壯碩的。腰肢雖還保持着女性所固具的曲綫條，但是襯托着寬闊的肩膀肯臀部，充分的表現着健康的徵象。這是完全符合着都市中人所說的健康美的條件的。但「建康美」，却不是此輩女轎夫們所能理解的。伊們的惟一目的，便是用勞力，換取「老爺」，「太太」，「先生」，「小姐」，荷包裏的金錢以補生活之不足。</p>
<p>我們不要瞧着此輩女轎夫，常是喀嘻哈哈的，而以爲伊們的生活，是很可樂觀的。在實際上，伊們的「嘻喀哈哈」，原因還是爲了「花殘個錢，出來尋尋樂事」的遊客。要不是伊們善於那麽的「嘻嘻哈哈」，說不定的，伊們還不能得到現在怎麽微薄的報酬量，而不够於補助伊們的貧乏的家庭生活呢</p>
<p>「女轎夫」，那不過是遊人們所給與的名稱。在詩人的筆底，或許是可被寫成「抬山轎的姑娘」的。但這是無關實際的。因爲此輩女轎夫，是只把抬轎，視作副業的，不過在春秋二季中，伺候伺候遊人而已。（自然，在夏季冬季中，若有遊客，伊們也抬，不過遊客是很少在嚴寒酷暑中旅行而已）。伊們的正當職業，是耕田，是像別處所在男子們的那麽下田工作。原因是在那些所在，丈夫們是儘可一天天，一年年的挨度着「懶虫」的生活，把一切生活的重擔，都擱在妻子們的肩頭上。</p>
<p>在這些蘇州的名山左近的小村落中，特別發達的，是茶館，酒館，以及烟館等等。年靑的漢子們，儘有整天的盤桓在內的。高興時，還可暢快地賭一陣子。這麽着消耗掉的金錢，却都不是用自己的血汗去換來的。至少，有百分之九十，是向出賣着勞力的妻子們，所壓榨得來的。自然，家中的開鬥七件事，不用說得，是完全由妻子們維持着的。</p>
<p>由形式上瞧來，這種出賣旁力，而維持丈夫的吃喝的妻子，不管是丈夫們的奴隸。但在實際上，丈夫們由妻子們供應着吃喝，那分明妻子們，是處於主人的地位。但是相互着的主子奴才，却大家能相安無事，而且能頗有歷史的維持着這麽個制度，這眞不能不說是蘇州風土誌中的一個奇跡。至於這一種社會制度的如何會得形一成，那麽，筆者雖是蘇州人，却也不知其底蘊。</p>
<p>但是，當我每决見到這種女轎夫時，我總覺得，這在婦女問題中，是佔着相當地位的。</p>
<h3>請小姐們莫蹈覆轍</h3>
<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>盧小姐是位鄉下姑娘，什麽摩登式，什麽時代化，是絕對不知道的。但是伊能種田，紡紗，織布，烹飪等，前一月，不知什麽綠故，忽然伊的丈夫要和伊離婚了，因此，這位小姐由丈夫及律師，做好圈套，使無知識的弱女子去鑽，上當自然是意中事了，我爲了伊實在可憐！所以懇本刋主筆先生，乞借一角餘地，向諸位吶喊。</p>
<p>事實是這樣的：某月某日，伊的丈夫領着伊到上海去玩玩，於是伊就到伊的丈夫和律師等所的的　　旅社，（因爲伊不識字，所以旅社呌什麽名字，都不曉得。）到了以後，就由律師拿出解的書，向這位目不識丁的盧小姐，唸了解的的條文，可是伊因爲不識字，那裏記得許多解的書上的細則條文呢？自然都忘掉了，接着由丈夫律師等的逼迫，伊在解的書上捺了指印，唉！伊怎會知道捺了手印，就鑄成解除婚的的大錯呢？後來丈夫良心還好，買了一雙花皮鞋，買了些衣料，封三十元鈔票，包了一個衣包，就送了伊回去，（指盧小姐的娘家）說：「你以後不要再到我家來了。」於是伊只得姍姍地回到自己家裏去。經伊的父母一再訊問，才知每年夫家有五十元的貼補，共計有一千元，分二十年補淸，可是這樣鷄零狗碎，又無子女，呌伊拿這五十元可養活，自己嗎？現在生活程度這麽高，怎樣維持呢？過二十年以後，呌他靠誰呢？父母難道能够養到她老死嗎？等到伊拿出這張解約書來看，才知上面的條文，其餘恕不贅述了。伊的父母，對於女兒也沒有辦法，徒呼負負而已。</p>
<p>諸位親愛的姊妹們！可有指印的常識嗎？你們要曉得，捺指印是很重要的呀！因為幾萬個人的指印，有幾萬個不同，倘使捺了，你就休想不承認，法律上就生效力了。我希望識字的姊妹們！能够把今天我所講的盧小姐的事實，去講給不識字的婦女聽，使伊們不再蹈盧小姐的覆轍，這樣才不辜負我做這篇盧小姐吶喊的目的和價値了。</p>
<h3>女校生活素描</h3>
<p>— 綺鳳</p>
<p>在宿舍的洗面室裏：</p>
<p>一羣小姐們在忙着化妝，打扮·香粉，唇膏，胭脂，面友，……放滿了一張長長的洗面桌。</p>
<p>『嘻嘻！玲玲！鏡子借我照一照，你瞧：我把面友搽得太多了吧』？</p>
<p>『哈哈，活像個大屁股，幹嗎給老馬瞧』，百靈烏玲的話。</p>
<p>『小鬼！爛舌頭的！哼！』大塊頭雪的駡聲。</p>
<p>『麗，陳的你今天到聯華大戲院去瞧電影嗎？』倩的俏問。</p>
<p>『嘿！誰同他去！』麗的答語。</p>
<p>『啊喲！落花有意，流水無情；噫吁悲哉！』慧替陳悲呼起來啦！</p>
<p>『喂！大家靜一點，我的唇膏那個拿去了？』大塊頭雪呌着。</p>
<p>『啊！你瞧：水潑在我的襪子上啦！』</p>
<p>『耍死的，你瞧。』芬被美碰着伊的眉毛跟着被碰的手畫在太陽穴上了。</p>
<p>『哈哈，你們瞧：芬的眉毛生在太陽穴上了！』百靈爲玲拍着手大聲說。</p>
<p>接着大家一陣子笑。</p>
<p>當化妝梳洗將好的時候。</p>
<p>課鐘噹噹地響了。於是一羣小姐們趕快收拾，收拾好之後；伊們在自己的桌上拿着課本挾着一同向敎室去上兪先生的黨義課。</p>
<h3>報娘恩</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>誰言寸草心，報得三春暉！」慈母的恩，其大罔極，眞呌人難以親答。雖然孔老夫子曾說過「生事之以禮，死葬之以禮，祭之以禮」；還有「養口腹，養志」等等，我總覺得畢竟不能報母恩於萬一。偏是有一等人很聰明，竟想出了一種「報娘恩」的辦法來。不過這種方法是吾使他的老母開心？是吾親答他老母生育的恩澤？現在我不妨寫出來給大衆檢討一下。</p>
<p>前幾天我到江灣去遊玩，走到半路上，凑巧逢着鄉人在賽會。金　聲聲，硬牌對對，煞是威風。接着馬執事打扮得像戲台上的武生；陰皂隸兩眼直瞪，有些鬼氣，倒也令人好笑。再接着有少年十幾個，半披着單衫，半身是赤膊着，在這寒冷的氣候裏，眞有些難能可貴。再看他赤着的手臂上，用細的鈎針，密密陣陣的鈎在皮膚裏；這不算數，下邊有的掛着十幾斤重的香爐，有的懸着金鑼，邊走邊敲。這薄薄的臂皮，給重的東西懸着，血隱隱好像是撕下來一般。他們的額角上，汗球像黃荳般掛下，可是還是裝出泰然自若的悠閒神情來，看了眞呌人好笑。我問問看熱鬧的旁人，這一種是吾是尙武精神的表示？他們搖搖頭，不的而同的說道；「這是報娘恩呀！人們在神佛之前這樣一來，母親養育之恩便報了！」</p>
<p>我回來仔細地思索一下，這樣地「報娘恩」，竟推翻了曾老夫子的「身體髪膚，受之父母，不敢毀傷，」的學說：而且實際上他老娘看見了自己兒這般的做作，是吾是哈哈大笑呢？還是暗地裏在心痛？</p>

<p>健康之路</p>
<h3>健康的美容法</h3>
<p>— 顏施曼珠</p>
<p>時代的潮流已趨向健康美了，健康美是眞美，不搽粉不塗脂，從銀錬身體着手。本來裝飾美，倒反掩飾了眞美，又容易發生粉刺，靑瘢……</p>
<p>我從前是不喜運動的，一天到晚的工作，無非做些刺繡，烹飪，抱小孩子，身體一天瘦似一天，面上生了纍纍的細胞，用指一捏，有米粒狀物，從面跑內鑽出，毛孔也漸漸擴大，膚色黝黑，容貌漸趨惡劣，後來在綠綺姊那裏得到一個效方，行了沒有多時，斑點就消滅了，兩頰豐滿，膚理細嫩，顏色白中泛紅，沒有半點脂粉汚跡，有天然的眞美。今天介紹給姊妹們，望勿看了手續簡便，疑心它沒用！這一個法子完全根據生理作用，功能疏通血流，恢復新陳代謝力，改良肌肉，促進美容，兼能保持身體健康。初行此法的，在一月內，須有恒心，不能間斷，不然，功能盡棄很可惜的！</p>
<p>每晨漱洗畢，照下面方法，挨决施行，再去辦別種事：</p>
<p>雙手並向前舉起，成水平錢，足趾貼地，足跟提起，的半分鐘。</p>
<p>挺身直立，胸部凸出，兩手分左右，成十字形，然後緊握雙拳，同時牙關咬緊，鼻吸停止，的行五秒鐘，行時雙拳努力移向後方，使全身筋肉顫動，如伸賴腰一樣。</p>
<p>用手在頸項周圍摩擦三遍。</p>
<p>用二指，在喉管左右，揑十下，（　時耳內微聞啯咽聲爲合格）。</p>
<p>用左右手指，在左右耳根摩擦，漸移向兩頰，鼻，額，唇的上下，反復行之，約一分鐘</p>
<p>口張大，舌伸出，行三决。</p>
<p>頭旋左，（至極度爲止）再旋右，（同）左右共行三次。</p>
<p>變手挿腰，下身直文，上身側向左方，漸移向前，右，後，行一决。</p>
<p>晨餐。</p>
<p>最好同時服有力的補血藥，須兼淸血之功的。這法在春初或秋冬行之，頂易見效，行後數日，面部或有現形類面飽之微粒，係摩擦太重，再行數日，自能退去。</p>

<h3>黃興夫人　對現代婦女的觀感</h3>
<p>— 萍</p>
<p>敎育事業，是基本工作；　各盡其能，為社會效勞！</p>
<p>黃克强夫人，是女界中能</p>
<p>苦幹，有毅力的一位健將，我和伊會談之後，覺得人家對伊這樣一句褒語，確是說得很恰當的。此番我遊覽首都之餘，曾去訪問過，那是一天早晨九點的時候，趨車至「開國紀念第一貧兒敎養院」，司閣老人點首出迎，記者說明來意，他欣然導入會客室，坐片刻？老人傳報院長請進！於是穿過了幾條走廊，看到許多孤苦的孩子們，有的工作，有的跳躍，個個精神飽滿，見客來都很着體貌，受過敎養的苦兒，畢竟比失學的孩子悻運得多了。半壁寫着兩行大字：「無不做工的學生」，「無不讀書的藝徒」，據說這是黃夫人的題句，伊敎養貧兒的宗旨，可見一斑。</p>
<p>記者在會客室裏見到一幀黃夫人在美屬檀香山華僑歡迎會席上演說的照片，引起聽衆激昂慷慨的精神，想見當年夫人革命精神的雄壯；這時夫人緩步入室，笑容可掬，略作寒喧，便開始如下的談話：</p>
<p>「夫人辦理貧兒敎養院多年，想來與趣濃厚，請報吿一些經過情形。」</p>
<p>伊對於數養院院務，似乎很多感慨，因爲過程中遭着許多挫折，到如今還不能把院務穩定下來，社會各界未能盡量輔助，三百六十餘苦兒，尙在風雨飄搖中，這使　感到最大的缺憾！譬如說敎養院創立以來，已有十七年歷史，想籌一筆基金，而十分困難，經常費爲數有限，僅足維持員生的生活費，致使各方保送的苦兒，無法收容；敎育當局只准辦小學，不准設立初中，滿擬提高學生程度，造就人才，爲學制所限，莘莘學子，不能發展天才；夫人有幾句感慨的話；「……我不是資本家，不是事業家：也不是敎靑家；區區敎飬事業，全仗社會贊助，否則心餘力薄，一切都成夢想不過我生存一天，盡我一天的義務，無論遇何困難，决不推諉」</p>
<h3>黄克强夫人</h3>
<p>黃夫人對院務說得很詳盡，但我的來意，是訪問伊對婦女問題的意見，所以掉轉話機，發出另一問題：「夫人主張中國婦女目前應做何種工作？」</p>
<p>伊沉思一會，便說：「最好應做切實的基本工作－－－敎育事業，敎育允其需要的，是特種敎育，如孤苦無依，貧弱無能，以及盲啞的殘廢敎育，向來爲人們所忽視，我婦女同志，應竭力提倡，爲苦兒謀幾許福利。至於在家做賢妻良母，這是份內事，毫無疑義的」</p>
<p>「婦女服務社會，也有許多困難，夫人對此有何高見？」</p>
<p>「婦女因生理上的關係，當然不能與男子相提並論，一般婦女治理家政，已覺責任重大，　論兼顧外務。但有一部份能力優厚的婦女，應各衋其能，各就所長，視其個性所好，盡力爲社會服務，我相信獲得的效果，必什倍於家庭。不過婦女服務的年齡，不及男人，一個女人到五十歲以後，精神便退化了，所以社會事業，男人的責任比較重，成績也比較優，都是自然的現象；在此種塲合，男人不該輕視婦女，要取補叻合作的熊度。」</p>
<p>黃夫人年近花甲，而面色紅潤，看來似甚强健，我便問起夫人的日常生活和娛樂方法</p>
<p>夫人不承認自己有健康的身體，而且是極衰頹的氣質，伊說：「早年本是很頑强的，自克强先生故後，遭極度的刺激；民四日本逼我承認二十一條，痛苦加深；九一八東北突變，神經更受打擊，因而失眠，血　在二百度以上，自己知道虛虧已極。不　繁劇之任。我生活極簡單，不出外酬應，不到娛樂場所，我的娛樂，是看花種竹，日與苦兒談笑而已。」至此爲夫人攝取王影，鞠躬而退，但聞琅現書聲，苦兒勤讀不輟，頓時撥動我救苦濟貧的心靈！</p>

<h3>根治胃痛法</h3>
<p>— 王士英</p>
<p>胃痛病源。由來不一。用藥偏缺。卽難根治。其由於胃酸過多者。則以解酸爲尙。其由於胃炎腫脹者。則以去炎爲先　。其由於胃壁剝蝕者。則以護膜爲要。其由於胃筋拘鸞者。則以鎮抽爲急。他如幽門之漲塞。神經之刺戟。皆足以致痛。則化積寗神。要亦不可偏廢。如投用胃劑。面面顧到。病根固不難悉除。然以久病積弱之胃。如不加以培補壯健。則復原難期。仍非根治之道也。故吾人治久遠疑難頑痼胃痛胃症。積有心得。用述於後。以備借鑑。</p>
<p>患者張醒齋。定海人。年四十一歲。罹胃痛多年。遷延失治。去冬由其至友諸濬川君介紹來診。經余囑向中法藥房購服胃痛名藥「胃痛靈」治其胃痛。去其病根。並服「健胃素」培補其胃臓。痛患旣除。頓復壯健。與諸濬川君獲得同樣美滿之效果云。</p>
<h3>挽救衰弱戒烟斷癮</h3>

<p>然戒烟非難事也。如投用挽救衰弱之劑。則精神煥發。身體壯健。更餌服除毒斷癮之劑。則烟毒旣除。見烟自厭。調理安全。大功吿成。</p>
<p>向居於浦東爛泥渡之汝寳基君。染有烟癮。垂十二年。迭决求戒。均以身衰體弱。病痛百出。廢然中止。去秋由共同居陸君介紹來戒。余診得汝君不僅罹有神經衰弱各症。且骨節痠痛。遺精頻仍。卽囑向中西藥房購「服强斯登氏骨痛片」治其骨痛。服「希米脫氏固精片」治其遺精。至於除毒斷癮。挽衰起弱。則主用名藥「生殖素」。連服月許。病患悉除。頓轉壯健。安全戒烟。精神愉快。欣欣稱謝而去云。</p>

<p>患者鄭煜庭君。去冬來診。訴有四肢麻木不仁之苦。每逢令節及天氣陰霾。則骨節筋絡。痠楚難堪。曾服□□□。未有全效。經余囑向永安公司西藥部購服「强斯登氏骨痛片」。因本品兼顧瘋濕及餘毒。故服後骨節筋絡。兩感舒暢。四肢亦轉成靈活。據云數載沉疴。今始痊瘉。不啻重登袵席云。</p>

<p>七日各報有二則很可注意的電訊；第一則，「僞哈爾濱市公署，頃製『慰問袋』五萬個，向民衆强制徵募金錢，慰勞與義軍作戰中之日僞軍，民衆對此雖極反對，但在日僞重重壓迫下，亦祇敢怒而不敢言。……一俟全部結束，卽將由張景惠。于芷山等以决漢奸，挑選美貌之妻女數十名，及向民間强選之美女百餘人，分送各地慰勞日僞軍云」；另一則是，「僞第一軍區轄下之各部隊，因疊受義勇軍攻擊，死傷甚鉅，現爲充實陣容，以備應付義勇軍反對蘇蒙作戰計，除第一批募得之三百七十六名業已分發完竣，刻尙在積極招募中，惟因東北青年多有覺悟，寗願加入義軍喋血疆塲，不爲傀儡當走狗，故招募成續極有限云」</p>
<p>把上面二則電訊對照着來讀，我們可以發現在這强敵壓境，國難日深中二種不同人物的人格。一種，那是漢奸們，他們生平一無所長，所長的就祇有搜括民脂民膏，向主子搖頭擺尾的乞憐。九一八之前，張景惠。于芷山之流在民衆的心目間是怎樣的入物？我們如果不健忘，當還不至於就忘却他們的貪汚及其他種種的劣績；一等强敵壓境，這些沒有脊骨的奴才，一看新主子來勢洶洶，自然立刻去巴結新主子了。而主子們呢，人生路不熟，自然亟須要爪牙來對付鎭壓隨時隨地可成爲義勇軍的「匪民，現在旣迎上門來，那還何消說得。</p>
<p>這些沒有脊骨的奴才們旣換了個主子，爲了博得新主子的歡心，自然是得賣力一番的，而所能賣的力，除搜括民脂民膏是他們的拿手好戲之外，便一無所能，製『慰問袋』，『强選民女』，那祇是若干分之一的份內事耳。奴才和拍馬，根本是拆不開的。</p>
<p>和「漢奸」們絕端不同的是「覺悟」了的靑年，他們雖在「重重壓迫」中，但是他們决不叩頭求饒，或是减低愛國的熱忱，反之，他們在血的經騐中，是更淸楚的認明了敵人及其爪牙們的鬼蜮伎倆的。僞軍的招募，其「成續極有限」者，原也是份當然耳的。</p>
<p>敵人的加緊侵略，無恥漢奸的投降及「賣方」獻媚，都是不足懼的；所足懼者，是熱血靑年的熱忱是吾會隨了時日及壓迫的加緊而消沉下去？是吾會因爲「覺悟」的不澈底而畏縮不前！</p>
<p>中華民族的存亡是將由愛國靑年們的「覺悟」程度來决定的。</p>
<h3>碼頭</h3>
<p>— 白玲</p>
<p>靑島速寫之一</p>
<p>六月的黃昏。西沉的陽光，軟軟的熱戀着浩渺的海。恬靜的海風，微微的吹着水面嚮着有如少女的銀鈴似的笑聲。一抺灣曲的山巒，穩靜的躺在海底中間。葱鬱的山林，有着嘹亮的啾啁的歸鳥的歌唱。海鷗飄忽的飄忽的一羣一羣的翱翔於海面上。慢慢的，慢慢的遠飛了。</p>
<p>隔着山的後邊，有一股墨黑的雲烟，裊裊的翻騰着。漸漸的，漸漸的，灣的山巒却沉沒在烟的朦朧中了。</p>
<p>海好像是不平靜了。一隻巨大的軍艦吼着洪嘹的汽笛聲，直由山跟前滑過來，朝着膠海關碼頭衝去了。</p>
<p>於是，碼頭上奔忙着一堆吁喘的人影子。有專在歡迎海上的流浪者的南國的女兒的笑聲，有苦力的吭唷吭唷的呌聲，有小販的喊聲，以及懷里抱着孩子而跪在道旁的乞婦的哀吿聲，這些，這些却打破了黃昏的岑寂。</p>
<p>從剛剛進港的那隻艦卸下來一伴一件很重的東西，這時都堆在岸上。在那堆東西旁邊站着一個歪着鼻子的高個子水兵，他正在揚手向着一羣苦力打招呼。沒有幾分鐘的工夫，入影子已經圍掩了那堆東西和那個水兵。他們都在爭執着耍搬，有的兩個人搬着一件，有的竟互相的駡起來，這樣，那個水兵實在沒精力來照顧這麽多的一隻一隻的手。於是他喔嚕的駡起來，並且舉起拳頭，踢着脚。一個苦力負傷了。他兩手抱着一條流血的腿，痛苦的仆在地上。在人們的呼喊聲中，一個十來歲的女孩子，手里提着一筐子媒核，奔馳的，向這個負傷的男子跑來了。這個男子就是她的爸爸。女孩子兩手撫摸着爸爸的流血的傷口，她的手染滿了一團血，呵，好像她的心也染滿了一團血！她哭着，她仰起臉來瞧了瞧站在她旁的那個一動也不動而發呆的水兵，她傷心的又低下頭，沈着臉抽咽的：「爸爸，你眞是，怎麽不小心呀……」一邊哭，一邊穿在她身上的一件襤褸的竹靑色的小汗褂脫下來，牢牢的給她爸爸把傷口纏好。她的爸爸睜了睜眼，一把抓着她的一隻乾癟而又髒的小手，嘴唇顫顫的沒有說話。他哭了。</p>
<p>這時，站在旁邊的一個警察走近來，他把圍聚着一堆人驅逐開。他又舉起手來向那個水兵行了個軍禮，笑了笑。那水兵嚕囌嚕囌的跟警察說了好些話，然而那警察只能茫然的聽着，點着頭。半響，那水兵從腰里掏出一張五元的鈔票來，遞給警察，意思是讓他給那個小女孩。警察把錢接到手，他就連忙的靠近那個小女孩，這麽問：『你呌什麽名？』</p>
<p>『小珍。』</p>
<p>『你家住在那兒？』</p>
<p>『很遠哩，住在西大森。』</p>
<p>『家里有什麽人？』</p>
<p>『有媽媽，還有一個小弟弟。媽媽早就病了，有三個月。爸爸當苦力，我拾媒核。爸爸給他踢傷了，再不能做活了。媽媽又有病，我們吃什麽呢？』哭着，哭着，她用手擦弄着眼皮。</p>
<p>警察呆了半天，他便喃喃的說∶『把你爸爸送回家去吧，他給你五塊錢，你回家去給你媽媽。』</p>
<p>一部人力車拉着一個負傷的幽靈，在燈光發亮的街市上奔走着。小珍跟在車屁股後，抹着淚，手里熱烘烘的揑緊了一張五元的鈔票，呵，她底幼稚的心靈粉碎了！</p>
<h3>示衆</h3>
<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>當最後一次的長途公共汽車開走了之後，鎭上似乎顯得更加淸淡了。小店子都排上木柵，只有長享酒店還敞開着店門。二個沒有喝完酒的人在那裏談着話，櫃台上那支煤油燈的光亮，衝出了店門，橫洒在石板路上。</p>
<p>風夾着小雨打街心走過，道旁的槐樹在風過時，搖下了許多水珠，打落在街心的水潦里，便濺起了一陣微微的水花，許多水泡映着燈光，像荷葉上的水珠一樣。</p>
<p>遠處傳來了一陣低低的吠聲，在雨里顯得格外遲重。</p>
<p>店裏，癩痢頭放下了酒杯，咳嗽一聲，用姆指在鼻頭揩了揩，然後將兩個肩膀緊夾着，向王聲這樣說：</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>「還不是眞的，我親眼見過的今早上城的時候。」</p>
<p>於是他們兩人又沉默起來。就在這時候，掌櫃的把算盤一掦，挺起身子，問癩痢頭說：</p>
<p>「頭，金　的事，你聽過？」</p>
<p>「人家說的沒錯兒！我親眼見過的。他們把他砍下來，放在石灰堆頂，紫色的血滲在上頭……」他似乎不忍再說下去，可是接着：「看的入眞多，有四個老總站在旁邊看管哩，唉！」</p>
<p>「像金香的人，哎，狗還會咬他嗎？」掌櫃的說。</p>
<p>癩痢頭沉右叵憶裏∶他覺得那個喜歡扮鬼臉的瘦個子，似乎出現在他眼前。他記得在出事的前三天，他還的他一起到城裏去買卜內門的肥料，可是九天前，他竟然不見了，直到前天才曉得他犯了案給捉住了，今天城裏已把他的頭砍下來，擺在街心上示衆，這一切在他眞覺得變化得太快了，太神秘了。他有點捫人着鬼腦，一面用手搔着的後腦袋（那裏的頭髮像剛挿上的秧，稀稀落落地沒有幾根）一面向王聲這樣說∶</p>
<p>「聲兄，借給我百把錢用，可行？呌我收他的尸別說我辨不起，衙門裏的老爺也决不答應，我只想　斤把銀紙，送他幾個錢化。你想怎樣，……」癩痢頭說。</p>
<p>步聲沉沉地從遠而近了。一個披着梭簑的人走了進來，他抖了抖簑衣上的水珠，弄得燈火不住地閃搖着。</p>
<p>「掌櫃，來半斤酒。」</p>
<p>那個人臉色十分灰暗，披着那件梭簑，遠遠看去，就像一隻刺蝟。他一骨碌地坐下去，不住地搖着頭。</p>
<p>「嘖，嘖，嘖，金聲的聲情，寃枉呵，寃枉呵！」</p>
<p>他接了酒盃，把酒倒下來。驟然又楞住了。他站起身來，兩手按着棹面，支起身子他使勁地在桌了扳了一掌，把酒中翻倒了，酒從架角流了下來，滴在王聲的布鞋上。</p>
<p>「金香，這樣的一個人呵！」王聲低低地說着。</p>
<p>癩痢頭茫然地望着街上，雨還是不斷的下着。是一個婦人的聲音在道上嚷着說∶「三的爸，你死了嗎？這樣大雨大，難道要死在外邊不成，金香帶你去啦！」</p>
<p>癩痢頭打了一個寒噤。他低低地求着王聲說：</p>
<p>「聲兄，我耍稱把銀錢化給金香，你借我二百文？」</p>
<p>「到什麽地方化給他呢？」</p>
<p>「我想到南校塲去，他們說是在那兒斃他的。」他說。「還有比他待再好的人？我同他非親非戚，可是……」癩痢頭哽住了，二顆斗大的淚眼從眼角滴下來。</p>
<p>金香，哎，寃枉了他了，這個老實人。」掌櫃感慨地說。「頭，明兒要是上城里化紙錠，我寄你五百，記住！」</p>
<p>風帶着濕氣吹進店裏來，燈火不住搖曳着。遠遠得來了一陣陣吠聲，低沉得像得鬼哭。</p>
<h3>賣麵包的人</h3>
<p>— 里昂</p>
<p>不知道他的姓名，亦不知他的出身，每天兩决，早上與傍晚，他總是帶着灰蒼的臉，灰蒼的嘴唇，喘息着，在我們校門口，把重重的祖子滑下肩，坐在沿街邊的那塊界石上，身子靠着牆，讓壅在咽喉間的氣慢慢平服，然後，他招呼着每個熟識了的主顧。他是賣麵包的人。</p>
<p>亦有好些高貴的同學不愛吃他的麵包，嫌他的麵包沒有奶油，沒有粗粒的葡萄乾，沒有上等果子醬，嬌嫩的腸胃不慣容納這種枯槁的食糧。亦有人問過他：『嘿，賣麵包的，你眞蠢，你不會販點精緻的麵包來賣嗎？老是這種堅硬粗糙的東西……』其實他何嘗蠢，他的</p>
<p>回答是：『眞是先生們說的話了，做生意的誰不望貨備得多，合主顧脾胃，好多賺幾錢』，……說到這裏，他老是要喘那一陣子氣的。</p>
<p>……接着他嘆息起來：『唉唉……沒有這麽多本錢，可怎辨呢？』</p>
<p>我每决向他交易，總見他從抑鬱勉强扮着笑容；「先生，今天的麵包不小吧，氷糖屑亦多，嚇哈……』有幾决，我亦在無話可說中同他答一句：『可惜總有些酸澀味呢。』他聽了，很戚到不安的樣子『眞的酸嗎？可是我不知道呵，我從來沒嘗過自己的麵包呵，連屑子都賣給人家炸猪排的，先生，我凖得同批發店家交涉……』他又喘息起來，於是，我深悔不該促動他的不安。他是爲我食糧服務的人，他每天代人家送麵包而自己連屑沒份兒嘗，這該是享受者的不安吧，可是，許多主顧都不給一些同情。』</p>
<p>有一天退課下來，忽忽趕到校門口，沒見賣麵的人和他的担子，街沿上，界石邊，有着幾滴血漬，和一些麵包屑，據門房說，是被巡査抓進局子去的，因爲他沒有攤基執照，起初他不肯走，就被挶上幾下，鼻子裏放着血，邊按住鼻孔被扭走的……聽着，自己的鼻孔亦感到辛酸。</p>
<p>那天早上我沒有吃東西。午飯時見魚塊上還留有紫色的血絲，我又記起賣麵包人來了，沿街，界石上的血漬似乎又顯現在眼前，我幾乎沒有勇氣吃那盆魚。呵呵，盆裏的魚塊，被捲混在生活洪流中的人……我怎樣去判別呢？一直到念口徘徊，懐弄着被生活殘踏着的麵包販。</p>
<p>接連三四天，都沒見到他影踪，有點猜他被鍋傷了，有點猜或許他已經因傷而死了。高貴的同學說：『他不來又値得什麽，他的麵包老是那種粗糙無味的。』可是，他今天一早又發現在校門口了，不過，他有着更灰蒼的臉的嘴唇，依然坐在那塊石上，依然喘息着？招呼着每個主顧：『先生，今天的麵包不小吧，氷糖屑亦多，嚇哈……』他依然笑着招呼我，對我說；『下月起，我要把這副麵包擔子給我兒子，有病的身子是受不起風浪了。』</p>
<p>我想不出話敷衍時，嚼一口麵包，依然是酸澀味的……</p>
<h3>深圳的夜</h3>
<p>— 葉萊</p>
<p>——旅途雜記</p>
<p>傍晚的時分，靜寂的九龍披上了一層輕紗似的晚霞，從海面飄過來的海風，那麽溫柔地襲着旅人底心胸，天空展開着一幕漸漸兒黑的晚霞，南方人正是需耍尋求刺激的時候了。</p>
<p>「到深圳去，那兒會給你許多新鮮的感覺的。」</p>
<p>又是一個新的朋友，莉莉君像小孩子似的拍着我的臂膀，我的心很愉快，我樂意去找尋新的影子，在那迷人的場所里去探求處在帝國主義的勢力範圍內的各　暗角，也許，我是希望着决殖民地的人們慘痛，整個地展開在我的眼前</p>
<p>跟着莉莉跑到那巨大的火車站上，已看到對海的香港的水面，反映着虹霓的燈光，輕輕兒的蕩漾着，那兒已完全地迷在燈光裏，展開着的烟幕，越顯得糢糊了。</p>
<p>火車站裏來來去去的人顯得那麽熱鬧的，一忽兒，長列的火車就把我們帶走了離開了那嘩嘩啦啦的市集似的地方，開始向着烟霧裏飛奔着，在車廂裏，所看到的大都是公子，少爺的派頭的人物，男的，女的，夢想的微笑的臉兒，從淡黃的燈光底下反映了出來，從車廂裏眺望出去，那遠的山峯，已迷在晚霞裏，奔走着，平野上的雜草，平野上的業舍和小樓房，使人感到這兒　染上了西默的鄉村的風味了。</p>
<p>轟隆，轟隆地響着，這習慣了的火車調子，像怒吼的獅子似地前進着，撩擊着旅人底心懐，倥偬的，就好像吿訴我快要到那迷人的塲所裏去，可以淸楚地看到人問的妖魔似的。</p>
<p>火車穿過了三個山洞，那時可以噢到窒息而惡臭的氣息，黑暗，就好像火車把我們帶到地獄一樣，那眞是多麽可怕的地方啊！不過，穿過了這些山洞，那是華南最華麗的賭塲，跑狗塲，深圳已在平野上披着美麗的衣裳出現了。</p>
<p>火車停下來，魚貫似的人就向着那九曲的橋梁上進去，停在站上的人很多，大都是華麗的人物，姑娘，整個地罩上了貴族的社會的色彩，我走進這樣的地方，無形中有了拘執起來了。然而，那一灣一曲的木橋上，可以望進深圳內面去，都是一虫煌耀的燈光，好像神話裏的仙國，裏面傳出來的歌語，響亮地飄揚着。（未完）</p>
<h3>落山虎</h3>
<p>— 林淡秋</p>
<p>每年快到淸明的時侯，母親照例要給我一封信，而且總提起「落山虎」的祖墳。</p>
<p>「……淸明又快到了，接信後應卽日動身回家，拜拜「落山虎」的太公墳，過了淸明就好出上海去的。……」</p>
<p>於是照例我又要想起關於「落山虎」的故事。</p>
<p>「落山虎」就是一座活像一隻落山虎的山，是全村頂出名的墳地，為了牠，一向主張多一事不如少一事的和善的父親，居然跟別人打了好幾年官司，倒了大半家產。然而父親當時一點也不後悔，因為這墳地終於判給了他，而且平平安安做下了墳。據風水先生說，這墳一定要大發：而且就從我這一代發起。於是全村男女老小都相信我大起來一定是個大闊老。</p>
<p>那一年我只有六歲。第二年就進本村初級小學讀書成績特別好，這正如一鍋滾油潑在人們對我的希望的火上。大家都贊歎那個風水先生料事如神。</p>
<p>父親是前淸秀才，又是淸末官辦洋學堂的畢業生，他自以爲很懂世務的。當家鄉一般秀才糜生一致主張我多讀經書，打穩撥亂反正的學問的基礎時，父親力持異議，要我早讀英文。他說當今最闊綽的莫如海關郵政的洋官，要做洋官，非精通英文不可。於是在第三年的春天，我就被送到城裹耶蘇堂小學裏讀英文去了。</p>
<p>由小學而中學，由中學而大學，我總算沒有辜負父親的希望，特別注重英文，至少二分之一的時間都花在牠上邊，但爲的却並不是如父親的希望，想做洋官，而是自己的興趣特別看中英文。假期回家，父親問我這東西英文呌什麽，那東西英文呌什麽，而我毫不思索地順口答了出來的時候，他總是笑裂了嘴巴，彷彿在說：「果然不錯。風水確有風水的。」</p>
<p>讀書期內，不知怎的，家裏經濟一年一年拮据起來。我每决瞧見父親籌措學費時愁眉苦臉的慘相，我總想請求他允許我中途輟學，讓我自謀職業，但結果總沒有說出口，大槪恐怕父親眞的答應了我吧？</p>
<p>可是有一决，我終於忍不住了。</p>
<p>動身的前夜，學費還欠十元，父親請人從這家跑到那家，大槪一切有錢借的人家都跑遍了，結果那人還是空手回報父親，說沒有田地押，他們不肯借。</p>
<p>「什麽？我十塊錢的信用都沒有了嗎？」父親眼圈一紅，快耍哭了。</p>
<p>「爸我不要請書了，我要找事做。我也快要哭了。</p>
<p>父親眉毛一揚，憤憤地說：</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>「要你　什麽？賣田就賣田。米倒在酒缸裏不會落空的呀！……」</p>
<p>到如今事實證明父親的米不是倒在酒缸裏，而是倒在汚水潭裏，非葷不會變成芳香的酒，別人還要因此暗暗駡他「暴殄天物」呢。</p>
<p>因此父親好幾年沒有給我信了。母親到底不如父親懂得世務，她對我的希望，不，對「落山虎」的希望，似乎還沒完全斷絕。證據呢，就是她每年快到淸明時候，總要給我一封信。</p>
<p>然而我也不必斬斷可憐的老母最後的一絲希望，我照例寫給她一封充滿希望的回信。</p>
<p>「……本當遵命卽日返里掃墓，奈因正在謀一肥缺，頗有成功希望，一時萬難離滬……」</p>

<h3>四月劇訉</h3>
<p>中國旅行團卽將來滬　兩齣反帝劇無形停止　戲硏所籌備星期劇座</p>
<p>喧傳已久將行來滬之中國旅行劇國，前因大沽口氷封，滯津未動。茲據先事來滬之該國團長唐槐秋氏宜稱，日昨已接該團天津來電，云决於十二日全體團員三十餘人均乘太古公司「湖南輪」啟程，預計的十六或十七日可以抵滬。該國此决南來，因所携劇用佈景道具等各項零件繁夥，如由津浦路南來，則運費浩大，故不得不取海道，乃使滬上人士，得先睹爲快。現唐氏已轉租定歐陽予倩舊居，專待全國人員抵滬，稍事休息後，即在某大戲院公演。聞其打泡戲爲三大名劇：即「茶花女」「雷雨」「梅蘿香」云。</p>
<p>宣傳將於本月份假上海戲院公演之兩齣反帝名劇「最初歐羅巴之旗」及「怒吼吧中國」，現已無形停止，蓋爲戲院方面之關係，五月份中之演出似屬不妥，現已改於六月份中演出。業餘劇人方面則有另行排演他戲之議，而上海戲劇電影硏究所則極力從事於星期硏究劇座之籌備，擬每週舉行話劇演出二塲，以便促進戲劇之普及運動，現聞該劇座將暫設於本市之某高等戲院，一俟觀衆普遍再行設法，自建正式劇塲，聞該星期硏究劇座將於二週內出現，第一次演出節目，也係滬上並未演過之名劇云。</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance is Studying Methods to Suppress Smuggling in North China</h3>
<p>Rōnin Smuggling with No Regard; Customs and Railway Bureau Await Instructions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) To curb smuggling in North China, the Ministry of Finance is studying the issue, as the temporary measures taken by the Tianjin Customs and the Beining Railway have not been effective. After Lin Shize, Superintendent of Tianjin Customs, and Xi Dingmo, Superintendent of Qinhuangdao Customs, reported the situation in Beijing, Minister Kong exchanged views with Vice Minister Yang Fu of the Railway Department a few days ago. There has been a considerable decision in principle on how to take effective measures. Zheng Lai, Director of the Customs Administration, went to Shanghai on the 10th to exchange views with Sir Frederick Maze, Inspector General of Customs, and listen to Maze's opinions. Zheng is scheduled to return to Beijing on the evening of the 11th. After Zheng returns, Vice Minister Zou Lin of the Ministry of Finance will invite relevant agencies such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Railways, and the Ministry of Industry to discuss the measures so that a decision can be made.

<p>(Tianjin) Empty houses on various streets in a certain Tianjin concession, such as Dahe, Xiaosong, Fukushima, and Horai, have been rented by rōnin to store smuggled goods. Because the rooms are small and there are many goods, some are placed on the sidewalks. Recently, the rōnin have hired civilian boats to transport the goods out, transporting them upstream along the South Canal, Ziya River, and Daqing River to various townships and cities in Hebei, Henan, and Shandong for sale. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The new method of suppressing smuggling in North China is ineffective. The Customs and the Railway Bureau are waiting for Lin Shize to return before following his instructions. Half of the customs personnel at the Tianjin East General Station have been withdrawn, causing smugglers to act with even less regard. This matter involves diplomatic points and will be handled by the Diplomacy Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council in negotiations with a certain party. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 10th, more than 3,000 tons of smuggled artificial silk, sugar, and piece goods arrived in Tianjin from the Liushouying of Nandasi, and were unloaded at the station's freight yard. Rōnin, armed, guarded the goods, forbidding people to approach. In the evening, the goods were transported by large trucks into a certain concession. On the 10th, Tianjin Customs seized two cases of rōnin smuggled goods in the French Concession. The rōnin escaped, and the goods were confiscated and transported to the Customs office.

<h3>The Beiping Municipal Government Issues a Circular Respecting Religion; The Case of the Two Destroyed Newspapers Has Been Resolved</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The dispute between the Shijie Gongmin and the Shijie Wanbao newspapers and the Hui people was resolved on the 10th. Shijie Wanbao has published an apology notice. The municipal government also issued a circular on the 10th, respecting religion. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The misunderstanding between the two newspapers in Beiping and the Hui people has been peacefully resolved through mediation by the municipal authorities and the Xinkai district. Shijie Wanbao published a notice on the 10th, stating that the article published by the newspaper about beautiful women from Hami was published in haste and without careful consideration, leading to this unfortunate incident. In addition to punishing the responsible personnel, the newspaper sincerely apologizes to the Hui people. (Central News Agency telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The municipal government issued an order to the Public Security Bureau on the 10th, instructing all newspaper offices to the effect that the government has always respected and supported all ethnic groups and religions in the country, sparing no effort in their protection.

<h3>Record of the Legislative Yuan Meeting</h3>
<p>The Statute on the Punishment of Actions Endangering the National Currency is Temporarily Postponed; Discussion Will Resume After the New Currency Policy is Ratified</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 55th meeting on the morning of the 10th, attended by 61 members including Zhong Tianxin. Sun Ke, Chairman of the Legislative Yuan, and Liang Hancao, Secretary-General, presided over the meeting. The review report on the provisional statute on the punishment of actions endangering the national currency, revised by the Finance and Criminal Law Committees, was submitted for discussion, but was not passed. The committee members generally believed that the new currency policy had not yet gone through the legislative process, and the subsidiary laws should also be temporarily postponed. After requesting the Executive Yuan to send the new currency policy to the Legislative Yuan for ratification, it will be discussed together. (Central News Agency telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan deliberated and revised the provisional statute on the punishment of actions endangering the national currency on the 10th. First, Ma Yinchu reported on the review process and stated that there were two reasons why the revised bill did not include a provision on concealing silver: first, if it were stipulated that even a small amount of silver concealed by civilians should be punished, it would be tantamount to opening the door for the police to create trouble for the people; second, using force to compel people to surrender silver would only make people conceal it further. It is only necessary to stabilize the credit of the legal tender, and the people will naturally be happy to exchange silver for legal tender. Jian Youwen then requested an explanation as to whether collecting silver antiques would be a crime. Ma replied that it would certainly not be a crime if there was no intention to use them as currency. The second reading then began, and the entire bill was passed in the second reading. Chairman Sun asked the reviewers to explain what the term "national currency" in the title of the bill referred to—silver coins or legal tender. Ma said that it should refer to legal tender. However, the provisions of the bill do not refer to endangering legal tender and seem to refer to silver coins. Moreover, Song Ziwen has already issued a statement abandoning the silver standard. What does the term "national currency" refer to? It seems that the Ministry of Finance should be asked to explain. Wu Jingxiong suggested changing the term "national currency" to "currency system." Chen Changheng said that the bill is a subsidiary law of the new currency policy, and since the new currency policy has not yet gone through the legislative process, the subsidiary laws can be postponed. The Executive Yuan should be requested to send the plan for implementing the new currency policy to the Legislative Yuan for ratification. Then, all legislation related to the new currency policy will have a basis. As a result, Chen's proposal was adopted. (Central News Agency telegram on the 10th)</p>

<h3>Song Zheyuan Cables a Request to Continue Issuing Yellow River Lottery Tickets; The Ministry of Finance Considers It Inappropriate to Approve</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Last month, Song Zheyuan telegraphed the Executive Yuan, requesting the continuation of the Yellow River lottery. The Ministry of Finance believed that the reason for issuing the Yellow River flood lottery in Hebei Province was that the three counties of Changyuan, Dongming, and Puyang had suffered extremely severe disasters and urgently needed relief. It was also submitted to the former Beiping Political Council for approval, limited to twelve issues. Later, it was found that the disaster relief situation was about to end, and the lottery was also issued to the ninth issue and then stopped. Moreover, the issuance of the lottery was to handle urgent relief. It is now proposed to continue issuing it, which is not appropriate, so as to avoid requests for precedents from various places. Song Zheyuan's original telegram stated that the problems left behind by the Yellow River in Hebei had not been eliminated. There are responsible authorities handling the methods of both treating the symptoms and addressing the root causes of the Yellow River flood, so it seems that there is no need to continue issuing the lottery. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the Executive Yuan, which was forwarded to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council for consideration. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<h3>Despite Strict Crackdown by the Authorities, Han Traitors in Southern Fujian Still Attempt to Act</h3>

Nagata will return to Tianjin soon. He has met with the Hebei-Chahar authorities, but has not discussed diplomatic issues in depth. Military Officer Imai's flight to Jin is also for inspection purposes and will return to Beiping in two or three days. (Central News Agency telegram on the 10th)</p>

<h3>Fellow Townsmen from the Northeast Request an Increase in the Number of Representatives to the National Assembly; The 23 Representatives from Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, and Harbin Are Treated Unequally</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Qi Shiying, Wang Shuchang, Su Bingwen, and others, fellow townsmen from the Northeast residing in Beijing, stated that the number of representatives to the National Assembly from the five provinces and cities of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, and Harbin, as reported in the newspapers, is only 23, which they believe is disproportionate. They have jointly telegraphed the central government and the Legislative Yuan requesting an increase in the number of representatives. The original telegram is as follows: "To the esteemed Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang in Nanjing and the esteemed Legislative Yuan: Since the September 18th Incident suddenly occurred, 30 million compatriots have been reduced to alien rule. Everyone is thinking of survival and overcoming. When will the shame of Kuaiji be avenged? We will not serve as Emperor Qin. How can we regret donating our lives to the East China Sea? We respectfully read Article 4 of the draft constitution of the Republic of China, which stipulates that the territory of our country includes the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe. Not only has the loss of the Northeast not been recognized diplomatically, but there are also no differences in treatment stipulated in law. Your far-sighted plans are deeply admired. However, recently, we read in the newspapers that the number of representatives from each province to the National Assembly is 45 for the most populous provinces and 10 for the least populous provinces. The five provinces and cities of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, and Harbin together have only 23 representatives, which is less than half the number of the most populous provinces. This is quite disproportionate. Upon investigation, the National Assembly had a total of 520 representatives, with 15 from Liaoning, 5 each from Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe, and 1 from Harbin, for a total of 31. Also, there were 596 members of the House of Representatives, with 36 elected from the three northeastern provinces. This time, the number of representatives to the National Assembly is fixed at 1,200, which is about 2.5 times the number of the National Assembly and the members of the House of Representatives. However, the number of representatives to the National Assembly from the five provinces and cities has decreased by about 10, creating a feeling of difference between the past and the present. The intention of the legislative authorities may be to reduce the number of representatives due to the difficulty of holding elections in the occupied Northeast. However, this is a matter of election methods, not a matter of allocating the number of representatives. Moreover, many Mongolians, Tibetans, and overseas Chinese cannot factually vote in their place. The representatives of Mongolians, Tibetans, and overseas Chinese are each 40. The population of the Northeast is over 34 million, and the total number of representatives is less than that of Mongolians, Tibetans, and overseas Chinese, which also involves unequal treatment. It is the intention of Shiying and others that the five provinces and cities of the Northeast are an integral part of China's territory. Since the central government has not recognized the existing puppet organization, the number of representatives should be handled in accordance with the same standards as other provinces, and there should be no differences. If we are placed behind Mongolians, Tibetans, and overseas Chinese, what will be the disappointment of the 34 million compatriots who have fallen into alien rule? Furthermore, the Northeast has been occupied for five years. Alas, our compatriots are groaning under the violence of powerful forces, and they dare not harbor any resentment. The sincerity of the people in thinking of the Han can be verified by Heaven and Earth. Our government's humiliation and burden are also understood by our compatriots. If the problem of the number of representatives causes them to feel regret or doubt that the government has a narrow-minded attitude, it seems to be a regrettable loss for unity and sincerity. For this reason, we jointly appeal, hoping that you will heed public opinion and increase the number of representatives from the Northeast so that it is proportional to the number of representatives from other provinces and cities, in order to show the government's impartiality and the unity of the country. We humbly await your command." Qi Shiying, Wang Shuchang, Su Bingwen, Zou Zuohua, Ke Xinge, Wang Xianzhang, Zhou Tianfang, Li Xi'en, Peng Jiqun, Zang Qifang, Bian Zongmeng, Xu Zhen, Zhang Xiangtao, Huang Jianqiu, Shao Hanyuan, Ding Weihan, Lou Xuexi, Xu Hongyu, Han Qinglun, Hu Tigan, Fu Guiyun, Liu Shouguang, Xu Wenguo, Chen Shutang, Gao Xiang, Ye Xiangqin, Dong Wenqi, Gu Gengye, Yang Zhihuan, Wang Zhiyun, Zhao Jinglong, Zhang Xinfu, Hong Sheng, Lin Guanying, Yang Wei, Li Zhi, Sun Yiwu, Wang Yangzeng, Gao Xibing, all kowtow.

<h3>The Japanese-German Alliance in the Midst of Tense International Relations</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Since the Rhineland issue arose, the evolution of the European situation has become increasingly complex. The peace proposals of the four countries of Britain, France, Belgium, and Italy have been rejected by Germany, and the military confrontation has intensified. In short, the Franco-Soviet-Belgian Little Entente has formed one group, while Germany, Poland, and Finland have formed another group, and Italy, Austria, and Hungary have formed a third group. Among them, the confrontation between the Franco-Soviet and German-Polish groups, as observed from the current situation, has reached an extremely acute degree. Although yesterday's London telegram denied the statement that France was preparing to send troops to the Saar region, it also shows the seriousness of the situation.</p>
<p>In the Far East, the situation is like a bronze mountain collapsing in the east and a bell ringing in the west, with frequent warnings from the Mongolian border. The situation in the Far East is becoming increasingly urgent. Recently, the Soviet Union and Mongolia established an agreement to resist aggression by a third party, and at the same time, the clamor for a Japanese-German military alliance is growing louder. The Manchuria Daily News, the organ of the Japanese Kwantung Army, even stated it explicitly. The combination of these two major militarist countries in the East and West cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Rumors of a secret Japanese-German military pact have been circulating for a long time. London sources have stated unequivocally that the main goal is to jointly oppose Russia. At the end of February, London financial circles even reported that Japan and Germany were currently conducting negotiations in The Hague, the capital of the Netherlands, to discuss the issue of economic cooperation between the two countries in Mongolia. The common goal is to divide the spheres of influence of the two countries in the construction of railways in Mongolia. The German Central Bank and the two major factories, Krupp and Thyssen, are involved in the matter. In addition, it is also noteworthy that not long ago, the head of the German economic survey team, Ke Pu, conducted negotiations with the Japanese side in Tokyo on business relations. Outsiders are still unable to predict the actual mission he was tasked with. The Millard's Review also reported that Germany will be the mediator between China and Japan, in order to improve Sino-Japanese relations. Based on this, it can be inferred that the possibility of Japan and Germany concluding a military alliance is extremely high, but the formal announcement may still be pending.</p>
<p>As for the effects of a Japanese-German military alliance, in our view, on the German side, it can strengthen its opposition to the signatories of the Locarno Pact through Japan's remote support, and cause the Versailles system and the collective security system to collapse. At the same time, on the Japanese side, this alliance can expand its anti-Russian forces in the Far East and promote Britain's reflection, so that Britain, in order to maintain its power in the Far East, will have no choice but to approach Japan. Therefore, the Japanese-German alliance is not only sufficient to boost the momentum of the two countries, but also has a great impact on the entire world situation.</p>
<p>Recently, Japan's actions on the Eurasian continent, the activities of the National Socialist Party members in Eastern Europe, and Hitler's declaration that he has no intention of taking back the former German colonies under Japanese trusteeship all show the consistency of the two countries' pace. The plan for a Japanese-German alliance can be said to have reached the point of fruition. The international turmoil that this alliance may cause cannot allow us to be complacent for even a moment. Looking to the future, the right path for our nation's survival is to strive to the utmost to strengthen our national power and improve our diplomatic capabilities.</p>
<h3>Financial Problems During Extraordinary Times</h3>
<p>Domestic economists offer various opinions; Ma Yinchu still advocates initiating income tax.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The issue of financial problems during extraordinary times has drawn significant attention from domestic economists since economic expert Ma Yinchu proposed that income tax should be the main source of revenue for the national treasury, supplemented when necessary by limited inflation and the issuance of a small number of public bonds. They generally agree that Mr. Ma's caution, learned from the painful lessons of Germany's wartime paper money policy, against adopting a similar policy in our country is a crucial plan to ensure the economic foundation of the nation during the restoration period. Otherwise, domestic capital would be completely wiped out, making recovery difficult even in several decades or centuries. However, income tax has not yet been implemented in our country, and even if the government were to begin collecting it immediately, there is widespread doubt whether tax revenue would meet expectations. According to what this reporter knows, some advocate reorganizing finances to enhance fiscal revenue during the extraordinary period, while others suggest requisitioning private wealth to relieve the national crisis. Still others propose initiating a land appreciation tax, increasing entertainment and luxury taxes, stamp duties, postal rates, and soliciting donations to enrich the national treasury. The reporter believes that this matter is an urgent problem that the people of the country want to solve, and thus presents the above information for further discussion with Mr. Ma, hoping to explore the matter from a theoretical perspective. According to his expression, he supports all of the above methods. However, the land appreciation tax has limited revenue, as was the case when Germany first implemented it, and it belongs to local revenue. In Britain, land appreciation tax and stamp duty revenue actually decreased during the war compared to before. Requisitioning private wealth is only feasible when the people have an extremely high patriotic enthusiasm. Other taxes, such as entertainment tax and war profits tax, although limited in amount, can still provide a small contribution. As for reorganizing finances, it should have been done in peacetime, and it is not an emergency measure for extraordinary times. In addition, he welcomes any other reasonable and legal revenue-generating ideas that benefit the country, so as to gather the wisdom of the masses. Mr. Ma still insists that income tax should be the main source of revenue during extraordinary times and hopes that the government will implement it immediately, so that people can develop the good habit of paying income tax, thus cultivating a good tax base for the country. If limited inflation and issuing a small number of public bonds are still insufficient to meet the urgent financial needs of the extraordinary period, it may be possible to utilize foreign capital or postpone the repayment of existing foreign debt, which may be another solution.

<h3>National Government Commends Du Yi</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) An order from the National Government on the 10th states: Du Yi, a supervising member of the Control Yuan, possessed pure integrity and profound insight. In his early years, he loyally devoted himself to the revolution in the provinces of Shaanxi and Shanxi, tirelessly promoting the cause. Subsequently, during the campaigns against Yuan Shikai and the Northern Expedition, he repeatedly offered strategic advice, never avoiding difficulties and dangers. Recently, in his role as a censor, he demonstrated remarkable integrity and diligence. It was hoped that he would further contribute his wisdom and be relied upon for a long time. However, upon hearing that he took his own life out of concern for current events, the government is deeply saddened and expresses its condolences. Therefore, a commendation is hereby issued to demonstrate the government's sincere remembrance of his loyalty. This order. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Responds to the Ministry of Industry, Providing Loans to Aid the Fishing Industry</h3>
<p>The Farmers Bank has been instructed to handle the matter as appropriate.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance responded to the Ministry of Industry, stating that with the fishing season approaching, aid is urgently needed. The Ministry has already instructed the China Farmers Bank to consider providing loans, and the fishing industry can directly negotiate with the bank to handle the matter. It is also observed that the decline of China's fishing industry is not solely due to a lack of capital. Without effective improvement measures, relying solely on bank loans may not lead to increased production and may instead increase the burden of debt interest, further impoverishing the industry. As for requesting the government to allocate funds or appropriate public bonds for relief, the government, being an administrative organ, cannot directly provide loans, and public bonds have designated uses and cannot be arbitrarily diverted. Furthermore, requesting government assistance every fishing season is not the correct approach. After careful consideration, the Ministry believes that to aid the fishing industry, a comprehensive plan should be formulated first to achieve a fundamental solution, thereby achieving the purpose of relief.

<h3>The Yellow River Upstream Ice Pressure Collapses Dikes, Yongding River Water Level Rises</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Suiyuan states that the Yellow River upstream has experienced ice pressure causing the collapse of two and a half li of dikes, and the Guanka area has been flooded for over thirty li. The floodwaters have reached the Wangfu area of the Dalat Banner, and telephone poles and lines have been toppled. Ice blocks obstruct the waterway, cutting off river transportation. County Magistrate Wang of Baotou has dispatched personnel and hired boats to rescue the victims. Due to strong northerly winds, the water level of the Yongding River rose again on the 9th. In Anci County, over thirty villages including Da Huizhuang, Huliandian, and Wu Daokou are experiencing flooding with two to three chi of water in the flatlands. The river channel appears to be shifting south, causing extreme panic among the villagers. (Special dispatch from the 10th)</p>

<h3>Eden Clearly States England Will Impose Sanctions on Any Aggressor Nation</h3>
<p>(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Eden stated again today that if any country invades the territory of another country with military force, Britain advocates imposing financial, economic, and military sanctions on the aggressor nation. Members of the Committee of Thirteen believe that this statement by Eden is the first official indication that Britain will continue its previous policy regarding future acts of aggression. It is generally believed that this statement by Britain is intended to correct a misconception that Britain's support for the League of Nations in the Italo-Ethiopian dispute is solely motivated by selfish interests. After Eden's speech, French Foreign Minister Flandin immediately requested that Britain take concrete action when Germany fortified the Rhineland. However, Mr. Flandin denied that France intended to occupy the Saarland when fortifying the Rhineland, and said that France would very much like the League of Nations to discuss the Franco-German European Reconstruction Plan. If peace can be guaranteed, France would very much like to allow Germany and the signatories of the Locarno Treaty to discuss a new treaty to replace the old one. (Guomin News Agency dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to what this agency's diplomatic correspondent knows, after today's meeting of the Committee of Thirteen, the tense situation of yesterday has eased somewhat. This can be seen in the following two aspects: The Committee of Thirteen, at the request of British Foreign Secretary Eden, issued requests to both Italy and Ethiopia, urging them not to use combat methods that violate humanitarian principles. This is quite satisfactory from the British side. Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the Committee of Thirteen that no matter where an act of aggression occurs, Britain will not hesitate to demand the full implementation of all provisions of the League of Nations Covenant, as it has done for the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. This is also welcomed by the French delegation. (Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<h3>German Envoy Returns Home to Report on Diplomatic Trip to London</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German envoy Ribbentrop recently flew from London to Cologne by plane and then traveled by car to Mulheim, where the Führer Hitler is currently staying as a guest in the home of the major industrialist Kilthau. Ribbentrop will meet with the Führer there to report on the diplomatic situation. (Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<h3>Death of German Ambassador to England, Hesch</h3>
<p>(London) The German Ambassador to England, Hesch, suddenly passed away after getting up this morning, at the age of fifty-five. Hesch previously served as an attaché at the German legation in China in 1907, then as chargé d'affaires in China in 1919, and was transferred to the German embassy in Spain in the same year. He was then appointed as the German ambassador to France in 1924, and then as the German ambassador to England in 1932. (Havas dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Has Not Yet Decided on Method of Italo-Ethiopian Peace Negotiations The Committee of Thirteen Announces Recess, Entrusts Chairman to Continue Contact</h3>
<p>(Geneva) As a result of today's meeting of the Council of the League of Nations' Committee of Thirteen, no decision has yet been made on how to proceed with the peace negotiations between Italy and Ethiopia. The opinions among the representatives of various countries have not yet converged. Some representatives advocate that the two parties involved should conduct direct negotiations under the guidance of the League of Nations, while other representatives advocate that representatives of the League of Nations, namely Madariaga and Avenol, should actively participate in the negotiations. (Havas dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations' Committee of Thirteen adjourned its meeting at 1:30 p.m. today, entrusting the chairman, Madariaga, to meet separately with the representatives of Italy and Ethiopia on Tuesday, together with League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, so as to report the results of the talks at the meeting next Thursday. At the same time, a questionnaire will be submitted to the two belligerent countries, asking them to make concrete accusations against each other's combat methods. In addition, the chairman of the League of Nations General Assembly's Committee of Eighteen, the Portuguese representative Vasco Goncalves, also intends to convene the committee to report on the development of peace negotiations between Italy and Ethiopia, but the date of the meeting has not yet been determined. The proposal to intensify sanctions against Italy has also not been considered. (Havas dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations' Committee of Thirteen is scheduled to continue its meeting at 11:00 a.m. this morning. Whether the Italo-Ethiopian war can be ended as a result, and whether sanctions against Italy will be intensified, will all depend on this meeting. Its key is naturally extremely important. At that time, Chairman Madariaga will make a report on the results of his talks with the Italian representative Aloisi last night, so that the committee can make a judgment. The so-called judgment is nothing more than the following two items: Regarding the two levels of stopping the war and starting peace talks, the Italian representative Aloisi has not been able to provide satisfactory guarantees. Italy is prepared to start peace talks immediately and has agreed to a ceasefire. If the Committee of Thirteen reaches the first conclusion, then the United Kingdom will definitely demand intensified sanctions and implement the oil embargo. At that time, even if the committee wants to evade responsibility, it will be difficult to open its mouth. But if the second conclusion is reached, then French Foreign Minister Flandin will demand the immediate suspension of the current sanctions measures, and British Foreign Secretary Eden will also find it difficult to refuse. In addition, after today's meeting, the Committee of Thirteen may extend the meeting to around the 21st of this month, but some people expect that the United Kingdom may demand that the meeting continue without interruption.

<h3>Secret Meeting of the Committee of Thirteen Chairman Reports on Contact with Italian and Ethiopian Representatives</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations' Committee of Thirteen held a secret meeting this morning at 11:30 a.m., which lasted for two hours. Chairman Madariaga made a report on the results of his consultations with Ethiopian representative Wolde and Italian representative Aloisi, stating that Ethiopia is still prepared to begin peace talks with Italy, but on the condition that he and League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol participate in the negotiations. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini invited Madariaga to Rome yesterday for face-to-face consultations, or to send representatives to Geneva again after Easter, and still maintains this view. Madariaga also said that he is now scheduled to meet with the Italian representative again on Tuesday and convene the Committee of Thirteen to continue the meeting next Thursday. British Foreign Secretary Eden immediately stood up and said that if the Italo-Ethiopian peace talks were to begin, the Committee of Thirteen should continue to meet without interruption, so as to assist Madariaga and Avenol and pay attention to the development of the talks. Madariaga expressed his agreement with Eden's opinion, saying that without the support of the Committee of Thirteen, he would not be able to preside over the Italo-Ethiopian negotiations. French Foreign Minister Flandin expressed his objection, saying that the Committee of Thirteen had already passed a resolution on March 3, requesting the two parties directly to conduct negotiations, and there was no need to continue the meeting at this time, but Chairman Madariaga could convene a meeting at any time. (Havas dispatch of the day)</p>
<p>(Rome) Chairman Madariaga of the Council of the League of Nations' Committee of Thirteen met with Italian representative Aloisi today to inquire whether Italy was prepared to cease hostilities. Regarding this matter, semi-official sources stated that Aloisi's mission was only to observe the progress of the second Locarno Conference, and he had no right to represent the government in responding to the questions raised by Madariaga. As for the peace negotiations between Italy and Ethiopia, Italy has never expressed opposition and has promised to send representatives to Geneva after Easter to discuss the matter, and has invited Madariaga to Italy to exchange views directly with Prime Minister Mussolini. Since both proposals were rejected, the purpose of the Committee of Thirteen's work at this time is simply to disrupt the negotiation situation and obstruct the victory of the Italian army. (Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Flandin held talks with Italian representative Aloisi, during which Aloisi explained that Italy was indeed prepared to begin peace negotiations, and that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had invited Committee of Thirteen Chairman Madariaga to Rome for face-to-face consultations, and had stated in his reply to Madariaga that representatives would be sent to Geneva after Easter to discuss the peace issue. Although both proposals were not accepted, the Committee of Thirteen has already met, but Italy still maintains its original position. (Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<h3>Urging No Inhumanity in Combat Italy Transports Two Hundred Tons of Phosgene Gas</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Thirteen, considering methods for immediately beginning Italo-Ethiopian peace negotiations, drafted a telegram yesterday requesting that both Italy and Ethiopia refrain from using gas or dumdum bullets, or from any other behavior that violates the laws of human warfare, and then adjourned the meeting until 11:00 a.m. this morning. British Foreign Secretary Eden proposed that a solemn request should be made to both Italy and Ethiopia to declare that they would no longer use gas. This matter is beyond the power of senior commanders or the air force, because only the government can permit the use of gas. We have learned from the manifests of Italian freighters passing through the Suez Canal that over two hundred tons of gas have been transported to the Ethiopian front. The most important thing now is to make it clear to the Italians that they cannot use this substance simply because it is in Africa. This view is absolutely unreasonable, and the British government does not agree with it. After Eden finished his statement, the committee decided to draft a telegram to the governments of Italy and Ethiopia. (Reuters dispatch of the day)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Thirteen inclined to issue a request to Italy and Ethiopia, the original text of which has been published by the League of Nations Secretariat, stating in brief: "The documents submitted to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol by the governments of Italy and Ethiopia, regarding both sides' combat methods violating current international agreements, have been reviewed by this committee. This committee hereby represents sentiments, requesting that the two belligerent countries must take all measures to ensure that incidents violating international agreements and principles of international law do not occur again, and deeply hopes that the two governments will provide assurances to dispel concerns." (Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations' Committee of Thirteen held a secret meeting at 4:00 p.m. this afternoon, which lasted until 6:00 p.m. A report was presented by the Legal Experts Subcommittee, stating in brief that the issue of the Italian army's use of toxic gas in Ethiopia was not within the scope of the Committee of Thirteen's authority, and the committee could not use it as a basis for deciding to intensify sanctions against Italy. British Foreign Secretary Eden did not disagree with this legal point of view, but said that the use of toxic gas should ultimately be avoided, and that the power to make the final decision on this issue rests with the governments concerned, because the manufacture and export of toxic gas must be approved by the government. The British government recently received a report that 200 tons of toxic gas were transported through the Suez Canal to the front lines in Africa. The Committee of Thirteen immediately decided to issue a request to both Italy and Ethiopia (both signatories to the 1925 Geneva International Convention) to immediately stop using toxic gas. The committee then decided to investigate the allegations made by the two countries against each other regarding barbaric acts, and the procedures for the investigation would be determined by the Legal Experts Subcommittee tonight. Thereupon, Chairman Madariaga presented the results of his meeting with Ethiopian representative Wolde, stating that Wolde had agreed to conduct direct negotiations with Italy, but on the condition that the Chairman and League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol participate in the negotiations. The Committee of Thirteen then adjourned, and it was decided to continue the meeting at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow, and then adjourn until the 21st of this month. After the committee adjourned, Madariaga visited Italian representative Aloisi, informing him of the committee's deliberations and inquiring whether Italy was prepared to cease hostilities and participate in peace negotiations. If Italy could accept this, then Madariaga would oversee the progress of the negotiations during the adjournment. (Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<h3>Second Locarno Conference Held in Geneva Yesterday Afternoon Italy Accepts Draft Agreement, Using Removal of Sanctions as Leverage</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The second conference of the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty (i.e., the four countries of England, France, Belgium, and Italy) is scheduled to be held at 3:00 p.m. in the League of Nations Secretariat. (Havas dispatch of the day)</p>
<p>(Paris) Belgian Prime Minister Janson arrived at Le Bourget Airport near Paris at 7:30 p.m. tonight by plane from Brussels and then took a train to Geneva to attend the second Locarno Conference. (Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Belgian Prime Minister Janson has already departed and is expected to arrive here tomorrow morning. The second Locarno Conference is scheduled to be held tomorrow afternoon. At that time, Italian representative Aloisi will only attend the meeting as an observer. It is generally believed that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has always believed that unless the sanctions against Italy are removed, his country will not approve the draft Locarno Agreement. This agency's diplomatic correspondent has learned that French Foreign Minister Flandin will state at the second Locarno Conference that if Germany violates Article 42 of the Treaty of Versailles and builds defensive fortifications in the Rhineland area, the French government will reserve the right to take any possible steps, whether collective or unilateral. British Foreign Secretary Eden will explain that negotiations with Germany have not yet ended, so Britain is unable to consider the various consequences of a failed negotiation at this time. The views of England and France differ greatly, roughly like this. Belgian Prime Minister Janson may mediate between the two to achieve a compromise. (Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Will Further Demand the Return of Former Colonies Preparing to Begin Active Diplomatic Action German Envoy Made Some Representations to England</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to reliable sources today, Germany has begun diplomatic action in order to restore its original colonies. The Führer Hitler's special envoy Ribbentrop recently raised this demand when speaking with British Foreign Secretary Eden in London. While officials here are unwilling to comment on this, Hitler has already planned the steps to be taken. (Guomin News dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<h3>If Rhineland is Fortified France Decides to Act Freely Issues Verbal Warning to England</h3>
<p>(Geneva) According to responsible sources today, French Foreign Minister Flandin has verbally warned British Foreign Secretary Eden that if Germany fortifies the Rhineland, France will decide to take effective action to deal with it, causing the Franco-German stalemate to become increasingly serious. (Guomin News dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(London) French Foreign Minister Flandin yesterday personally delivered a confidential note to British Foreign Secretary Eden. The French ambassador, Corbin, recently delivered a similar note to Under-Secretary Vansittart. According to what is generally known, its content states that the attempt to reach a compromise with Germany has recently failed, and the mandatory measures that the countries concerned should take in accordance with the Locarno Agreement should be implemented immediately. Although implementation can be postponed before the countries concerned decide to do so, the countries concerned should immediately receive this proposal and begin negotiations. Conversely, if Germany builds defensive fortifications in the Rhineland area, the proposal to postpone implementation will also become invalid. In addition, France proposes that the League of Nations Council should discuss the peace plan proposed by France and Germany, except for the part of the German plan concerning West European security. (Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of German and Hungarian Public Opinion on the French Peace Plan</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The semi-official political foreign affairs newsletter recently commented on the French memorandum, saying, "The various proposals put forward in the French peace plan, especially the proposals for collective security, mutual assistance, arms reduction, and economic cooperation, could be agreed to by other countries if they could be implemented smoothly. What is unknown is whether its scope is limited to the European continent or includes the Mediterranean coastal countries. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, although its national system is a simple unified system, and its territory has no distinction between Europe and Asia, in our view, the European border should end at the western border of the Soviet Union." (Havas dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Count Coudenhove-Kalergi (Hungarian), chairman of the Pan-European Union, recently published an article in the union's organ, the "Pan-European Communications," commenting on the European construction plan proposed by France, stating in brief that the French plan does not have any intention of establishing hegemony. Regarding the colonial issue, it can give all of Europe a good prospect. (According to the French plan, the distribution of colonial resources should be corrected so that European countries can obtain the necessary raw materials.) If this plan can be realized, then a corner of Africa, which was originally a field of competition among various forces, will be transformed into a factor of international cooperation. Its relationship is of great importance and cannot be overstated. However, the French plan does not mention the issue of ethnic minorities, which is also a shortcoming. According to the claims made by the paper France, the existing borders must be mutually agreed upon by the countries concerned before they can be changed, and they cannot be required to be changed within twenty-five years. From the perspective of Hungary, this is too distant, because from this moment to twenty-five years from now, ethnic minorities will have been subjected to abuse," etc. (Havas dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<h3>British Parliament Adjourns for Easter, Resumes on the 21st of This Month; Foreign Policy Sparks Heated Debate</h3>
<p>(London) After a heated debate in the British House of Commons regarding the Italo-Abyssinian War, Parliament adjourned today for Easter. They will reconvene on April 21st when the government presents its budget proposal. France's attitude towards sanctions and Italy's methods of warfare were strongly criticized by the House. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cranborne did not deny reports of Italian forces being the first to use poison gas in East Africa. He stated that the British government believes that if these serious allegations are true, they will raise extremely important issues, affecting not only Abyssinia but all of humanity and the future of civilization. He added that other allegations against both Italy and Abyssinia would also be investigated. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Political analysts predict that in the coming weeks, the Cabinet will split into two opposing factions. One faction, younger and led by Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, favors a more assertive foreign policy. The other, composed of older and more cautious members, advocates a more moderate approach to foreign policy. Members of Parliament say that the Cabinet's position is becoming critical due to the influence of the diplomatic situation. The most important issues are the Locarno Pact and the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Regarding the Locarno Pact, Britain believes that negotiations with Germany are not yet concluded. Therefore, if Foreign Secretary Eden exceeds the scope of staff talks and adopts political constraints—specifically, if the Foreign Secretary acknowledges that sanctions can be imposed on Germany if it violates Article 42 of the Treaty of Versailles (referring to the construction of fortifications in the Rhineland)—he will likely not receive the full support of his Cabinet colleagues. It is possible that he will follow in the footsteps of former Foreign Secretary Hoare and resign. However, if efforts to compromise with Germany ultimately fail, the British government will have to adopt a more resolute attitude, which is a separate matter. Regarding the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, it is feared that Italy's desire for a final victory cannot be prevented by intensifying sanctions, such as an oil embargo. If so, will Britain acknowledge that intensified sanctions are futile and abandon them, or will it demand the implementation of military sanctions? This is the crux of the matter. However, Britain is well aware that the implementation of military sanctions will inevitably lead to conflict with Italy. At that time, Italy will join forces with Germany, and a second European war will break out before long. Therefore, key political figures believe that the British government may abandon its policy of intervention in continental affairs and temporarily adopt a policy of isolation. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>Italian Army and Air Force Launch Four-Pronged Attack on Taixi, Completely Controlling Key Routes to the Abyssinian Capital; The War Reaches a Critical Juncture; Fierce Battles Erupt Simultaneously in the South</h3>
<p>(Rome) According to news from the East African front today, the Italian army in the north is mobilizing an air force unit, five infantry divisions, and one corps to advance on Taixi along four camel routes, with the ultimate goal of capturing the Abyssinian capital. The Italo-Abyssinian War has reached a critical juncture. The Italian front stretches from Lake Ashangi to Lake Tana, forming a fan-shaped line approximately 135 miles long. All key routes to the Abyssinian capital are under control. Another three divisions are moving from the rear to the front, and there are 100,000 workers repairing roads. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>Asmara Correspondent Balte reports: The Italian army in the north has already surpassed Gondar city and is camping on the plains between Gondar city and Lake Tana. An airfield has been built in Gondar city, where small aircraft can take off and land. Italian troops belonging to the Assebo-Bogalas and Gaiya-Galas tribes are now pursuing the Abyssinian army and defeated General Gaedashu's forces at Skogara, killing 2,000 enemy soldiers, capturing 700 mules and horses, and 500 rifles. It is reported that Gaedashu was seriously injured. General Gaedashu is related to Governor Seyoum of Tigray Province and once served as Minister to France. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>(Rome) Military sources recently declared that General Graziani, commander of the Italian forces in the south, will soon launch an offensive with the aim of advancing on Harar and the Abyssinian capital. At that time, General Graziani may be able to raise the Italian flag in the Abyssinian capital. In short, there will be astonishing news to announce on April 21st, the anniversary of the founding of Rome. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<h3>Using Aircraft to Supply Military Needs</h3>
<p>Asmara According to reliable non-official sources here today, General Badoglio, commander-in-chief of the East African forces, is accustomed to using a pincer formation, with the strategic goal of encirclement. The Eritrean Corps, advancing along the "Imperial Highway" towards Taixi, has occupied the town of Kobo, 25 miles from Guaranan, without resistance. They are now advancing on Waldia, 25 miles south of Kobo. In addition, the First Corps is advancing rapidly along the trade route to Magdala. Its vanguard is currently supplied by aircraft, demonstrating the rapid progress it is making, as it can only sustain its supply lines with air support. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Difficult Mountain Roads Make Italian Troop Movements Arduous</h3>
<p>(Rome) The column led by Starace (Secretary-General of the Fascist Party) previously captured the city of Gondar in northern Abyssinia. Detailed battle reports have recently been received, revealing the arduous journey of the column. The terrain north of Gondar is rugged and difficult to traverse. The Italian army's supply train consists of over 500 trucks. Crossing the Angareb River alone took 12 hours. In addition, Abyssinian soldiers were ambushing from the mountain peaks along the road, firing from high ground. The Italian army had to advance while also defending itself, making the situation difficult to imagine. It is now known that Abyssinian soldiers, due to the bright lights of the Italian trucks at night, which illuminated a range of up to 15 kilometers, were awestruck by the strong light and the sound of machine guns in the darkness, mistaking it for magic and daring not to resist. As a result, their morale has been undermined. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>Red Cross Refuses to Submit Report on Italian-Abyssinian Warfare Methods</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council's Committee of Thirteen yesterday requested the International Committee of the Red Cross to provide a copy of the report submitted by the organization's representatives stationed in Abyssinia on the current warfare methods of the two belligerent nations, Italy and Abyssinia, for the Committee's reference. The International Committee of the Red Cross immediately refused and released a public response this morning. Although the Red Cross agreed to the requests of the Italian and Abyssinian governments to send personnel to Abyssinia to investigate the warfare methods of both sides, the organization must strictly maintain neutrality in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute and exercise absolute caution. Therefore, it is inappropriate to provide a copy of the investigation results to the League of Nations Council's Committee of Thirteen. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>Hindenburg Airship Suffers Mid-Air Engine Damage, Diverts Course Through France to Return to Germany</h3>
<p>Port of Bordeaux, France The newly built German airship Hindenburg, which had previously made its maiden transatlantic voyage from Friedrichshafen, Germany, to the Brazilian capital, is now flying back from that location. According to reliable sources, the airship encountered a severe storm near the Strait of Gibraltar, struggling to move forward and damaging its engines. Around 5:00 PM, it urgently telegraphed the French government, requesting permission to fly over French territory in order to shorten its journey. The government has granted permission, and it is expected that the airship will follow the same route taken by the Zeppelin in previous years, entering France via this port or Marseille, then following the Rhône River Valley, crossing the Jura Mountains (on the border between France and Switzerland), passing through Basel, Switzerland, and returning to Friedrichshafen. However, the weather in southern France is currently poor, and it will encounter strong winds regardless of the route it takes. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The newly built airship Hindenburg, which had recently flown back to Friedrichshafen, Germany, from the Brazilian capital, has now reported that the airship suddenly experienced engine trouble over the Atlantic Ocean, forcing it to shorten its route and return to its home country for repairs. This news has recently been confirmed. The airship's original route was to bypass the northern coast of France, cross the Dutch border, and then return to Germany. Now, the route has been changed, and it will likely travel directly across the Atlantic to the Mediterranean Sea. However, it is still unknown whether it will pass through France or bypass France and take a route through Italy. As for the cause of the engine damage, both the Aviation Department and the Zeppelin Company have not yet provided details. However, it is widely rumored in aviation circles that the pump or piston of one of the airship's diesel engines has broken, indicating that the damage is extremely severe. It is also said that the pump was made of a newly invented aluminum alloy, which was originally very strong. Since this pump has been damaged, it is feared that the other engines may also not be guaranteed to be intact. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<h3>Executive Yuan Approves Zhejiang Provincial Public Debt Consolidation Plan</h3>
<p>Debt amount of 60 million yuan repaid in four categories with principal and interest; collateral includes central government subsidies, salt tax surcharges, etc.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan convened a meeting of relevant agencies, including the Ministry of Finance, at 4:00 PM on the 10th to review the case of the Zhejiang Provincial Government's issuance of 60 million yuan of Zhejiang Provincial Public Debt Consolidation bonds for the 25th year. Zhejiang Finance Director Cheng Yuanfan attended to provide explanations. As a result, the plan was approved in principle. The contents are as follows: The debt amount is 60 million yuan, divided into four categories: (Category 1) is fixed at 4.5 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 9%, and will be repaid with principal and interest over 14 years. (Category 2) is fixed at 17 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 7%, and will be repaid with principal and interest over 16 years. (Category 3) is fixed at 10.5 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%, and will be repaid over 18 years. (Category 4) is fixed at 28 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%, and will be repaid over 10 years. The usage and distribution are as follows: 55 million yuan is required to consolidate Zhejiang's debts. The remaining 5 million yuan will be used to partially make up for the budget deficits in the 23rd and 24th years, to manage Zhejiang's local construction projects, and to offset the consumption of unissued debt tickets of old debts used for redemption, as well as the losses from discounting the old debt tickets. According to the above distribution, approximately 30,000 yuan of the ticket value will be used for Zhejiang Provincial Government's local administrative expenses. A separate method will be established for the new ticket exchange for the ticket holders, and the exchange will be based on the number of each type. The collateral consists of four types: 1. Central government subsidies for salt tax surcharges. 2. Zhejiang Provincial land tax surcharge for construction special levies. 3. Zhejiang Provincial land tax surcharge for construction additional levies. 4. Zhejiang Provincial ordinary business tax. During the review, representatives from the Ministry of Finance paid close attention. Regarding the first two types of collateral, it was recognized that after the central government decided to abolish excessive taxes at the Second National Financial Conference, the Ministry of Finance had requested Zhejiang Province to abolish the land tax surcharge. At that time, due to the collateral relationship, the implementation was delayed. If there are any future changes, it will inevitably affect the fund. Therefore, after the clause on the collateral fund, an additional item was added, namely, if the above collateral fund is subject to any changes in the future, then the Zhejiang Provincial contract tax, stamp duty tax, and land tax revenue will be used as the second collateral and allocated to the public debt fund. In addition, Zhejiang Chairman Huang Shaoxiong sent a telegram to the Yuan, explaining that the consolidation of principal and interest of the debt had been agreed upon in advance with the debt holders, and Finance Director Cheng Yuanfan had already contacted banking circles in Shanghai and Hangzhou, who had all agreed to support. He also reported the situation to Minister Kong, so the passage was extremely smooth. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan convened a meeting of representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Gao Bingfang, Dong Puming, and Zhejiang Finance Director Cheng Yuanfan, at 3:00 PM on the 10th to review the case of Zhejiang Province's issuance of 60 million yuan of public debt consolidation bonds for the 25th year. The review has been completed and will be presented to the Yuan's meeting for discussion. (Central News Agency Telegram, 10th)</p>

<h3>US Treasury Secretary Talks About the Truth of Sino-American Talks</h3>
<p>Says There Will Be No Surprising Developments, But Will Continue for Ten Days</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, when meeting with newspaper reporters today, replied to various questions, saying that the talks with Chinese representatives Chen and Guo will not lead to surprising developments. The talks will continue for a week or ten days. Whether or not there will be tangible results cannot be predicted at this time. Morgenthau also replied to questions about the unusual activity in the Mountlee silver market, saying that he was unaware of it and that the Treasury Department was not paying attention to silver market speculation. However, Morgenthau declined to say whether this meant that the U.S. Treasury Department was withdrawing from various silver markets. It is now believed here that the issue of the Treasury Secretary's talks with Chinese bankers concerns the extent to which the United States can assist China in handling its national currency. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Since China began managing its currency last winter, its trade with the United States in December and January tended to be in surplus. However, in February, its trade with the United States turned to deficit again. According to reliable sources, China's imports of American goods in February decreased by 21 percent compared to January, while its exports to the United States decreased by 34 percent compared to January. In the future, China's trade with the United States may change even more, so the Chinese side may continue to sell silver to expand its credit. Therefore, there is considerable interest in knowing the future silver price. According to Treasury Department officials, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau held talks with Chen Guangfu, the leader of the Chinese banking delegation, on Thursday, and further talks may be held on Friday.

<h3>Xiamen: Communist Organization Cracked Down On; Fake Central City Committee and Fake Seamen’s Headquarters. Nine Communists Arrested, Including Taiwanese.</h3>
<p>Xiamen correspondence: The Detective Office of the Xiamen Municipal Public Security Bureau successively arrested nine accomplices on April 1st and 4th, cracked down on two important organizations: the Communist Party’s fake Central City Committee stationed in Xiamen and the Fake Seamen’s Headquarters’ Xiamen Committee, and arrested key figures. On the 8th, the Detective Office released the details of the operation because the entire case had been solved. Upon investigation, on the evening of the 1st, Liu Handong, Director of the Detective Office, led detectives and Li Caiwang, a Japanese consulate policeman, to arrest Sun Guiping, a Taiwanese, at the Shangtian Ancient Temple. Sun is currently the fake Central City Committee stationed in Xiamen of the Shanghai Chinese Communist Party Headquarters (referred to as the CCP). The organization was located at Sun’s residence. Multiple secret and reactionary documents were seized. According to Sun’s confession, Zhou Yingjin, also Taiwanese, and his wife, Lian Guohua, Taiwanese, and Cai Aihua were arrested on Datong Road. Zhou was a member of the Communist Anti-Imperialist League, Lian was the head of the Anti-Imperialist Women’s Department, and Cai, from Xiamen, was a member of the Fake Women’s Department. On the night of the 4th, Zhang Shengde was arrested at Xiang’an Temple. Zhang was the instructor of the Chinese Communist Party’s Fake Seamen’s Headquarters (referred to as the Seamen’s Headquarters) stationed in Xiamen and the leader of the Xiamen Seamen’s Headquarters Committee. A mimeograph machine, work reports, secret documents, and more than fifty kinds of fake central government orders were seized at his organization. At the same time, Gao Yuewu, a member of the Anti-Imperialist League and a member of the Seamen’s Headquarters, was arrested. Based on Gao’s confession, Li Qing and Li Sheng, from Anjing, were arrested on Datie Street. Li Qing was the head of the organization department of the Fake Seamen’s Headquarters Xiamen Committee, and Li Sheng was the head of the organization department of the Fake Dock Workers’ Union. Liao Shan, from Siming, who was a member of the Fake Grocers’ Committee, was arrested on Xiaxi Road. In total, nine people were arrested, and two locations of the fake Central City Committee and the fake Seamen's Headquarters Committee, both directly under the fake Central Government, were destroyed. Except for Sun, Zhou, and Lian, who are Taiwanese, Zhang Shengde also admitted to being Taiwanese, but there is no documentation to prove it, and there is no registration at the Japanese consulate. The two Lis are coolie workers, Gao is a painter, and Liao is a small vendor. Sun, Zhou, and Lian have been extradited by the Japanese consulate. According to Liu Handong, Director of the Detective Office, “Since the CCP sent personnel to Xiamen for activities, the Communist Party has been arrested multiple times since Yan Zhuangzhen was arrested in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934). Multiple Communist land organizations have also been cracked down on. The Communist Party's strength in Xiamen can be said to have been disintegrated. However, the Seamen's Headquarters is more tightly organized, so it has not been cracked down on in the past. In recent years, the Communist Party has continued to operate at sea. On the 1st of this month, Zhou, Lian, and Cai were arrested. On the night of the 4th, after receiving a report, Zhang Desheng and five others were arrested, wiping out the previously undetected Communist maritime organization. Therefore, the Communist disaster in this city can be said to have come to an end.” (April 9th)</p>
<h3>Quanzhou: Notorious Bandit Peng Yue Executed by Firing Squad; Colluded with Traitors to Disrupt Security; Sentenced According to the Law for Endangering the Republic of China.</h3>
<p>Xiamen correspondence: Peng Yue, a notorious bandit from Quanzhou, 35 years old, from Peng Village, Shanding, Jinjiang, was originally under Chen Guohui. After Chen was incorporated, Peng served as the company commander of Peng Tang's regiment under Chen. When the 19th Route Army eliminated Chen's troops, Peng Tang suffered heavy losses. Peng Yue, having hidden many guns, seized the opportunity to be promoted to battalion commander. After the Central Army suppressed the Fujian Incident, Peng Tang was reorganized into the 9th Security Regiment, and Peng Yue continued to serve as battalion commander. Because his power grew daily, he became even more evil. When Song Xilian, Mayor of Xiamen, was stationed in Quanzhou in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), Peng Tang accused Peng Yue of delaying military opportunities, killing and looting innocent people, protecting opium and gambling, and being corrupt and extortionate. He was arrested and sent to the Provincial Security Office. The case was unresolved. In March of this year, Peng Yue, in the province, had a Taiwanese intercede with the Security Office, using Peng's illness as an excuse, and requested bail for medical treatment. After Peng was released from prison, he secretly returned to Quanzhou with more improper plans. After the provincial government telegraphed the Quanzhou Third District Pacification Headquarters, he was arrested in Quanzhou City on March 11. After a joint trial by the Third District Pacification Headquarters, he was sentenced to death for endangering the Republic of China and executed by firing squad in Quanzhou on April 7. The announcement of his crimes stated: “This criminal, when previously serving as the battalion commander of the 9th Security Regiment, delayed military opportunities, protected opium and gambling, and engaged in extortion, looting, and murder, which was verified by the Fujian Provincial Government and detained for investigation. Later, he was granted bail for medical treatment due to illness. Unexpectedly, the criminal took the opportunity to flee back to Quanzhou, colluding with traitors to disrupt security. After the Ministry approved the telegram from Yu Bao, commander of the Fujian Provincial Government, he was investigated and arrested. The investigation confirmed that his crimes were unforgivable and should be sentenced to death in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 3 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Those Who Endanger the Republic of China. In addition to verifying the identity of the criminal and tying him to the execution ground, this announcement is made known.” (April 9th)</p>
<h3>Scattered Bandits on the Fujian-Zhejiang Border Will Be Cleared Immediately—No Large Bandit Groups in Eastern Fujian—</h3>
<p>Fuzhou correspondence: Zhang Fakui, the Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in the Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi Border Area, recently reached an agreement with the military authorities of Fujian and Zhejiang on a military plan to suppress bandits. The Zhejiang border area will be designated as the First Bandit Suppression Zone, and the Fujian border area will be designated as the Second Bandit Suppression Zone. Each zone will have two bandit suppression military columns. Zhang himself will concurrently serve as the commander of both bandit suppression zones. The deputy commander and the commander and deputy commander of the columns will be concurrently held by local military and political leaders. It was previously announced that Dai Minquan, the commander of the division stationed in Pucheng, was appointed as the deputy commander of the Second Bandit Suppression Zone on the Fujian-Zhejiang border and concurrently as the commander of the Third Column. Chen Yifeng, the administrative commissioner stationed in Pucheng, was appointed as the deputy commander. Tan Qingyun, the brigade commander, was appointed as the commander of the Fourth Column, and Chen Zhengmin, the magistrate of Chong'an County, was appointed as the deputy commander. They are required to complete preparations before the 15th of this month and begin suppressing bandits on the 16th, with a deadline of two months to completely eliminate the remaining bandits on the Fujian-Zhejiang border. As for the more than 1,000 remaining bandits who recently fled from Zhejiang into the border area of Pucheng and Chong'an on the Fujian border, they were jointly attacked by Dai Minquan's division in Pucheng and Zhou Zhi's brigade in Chong'an. They then fled from Pucheng County's Likeng and Yuanping to Dangxi and Jiaxi in Longquan County, Zhejiang. Currently, Dai's division is at Potou in Pucheng, and the Zhejiang army is at Huangpi in Longquan, mutually blocking them.</p>
<p>In Eastern Fujian, the bandit groups of Ye Fei and Fan Tiemin, totaling more than 600 people, were severely suppressed by local troops. They then fled from Fuding and Shouting to Taishun and Pingyang on the Zhejiang border. There are currently no large bandit groups in the counties of Eastern Fujian. As for the two regiments of Yang [missing character] and Yi Qiji, who were pursuing the bandits, their vanguard has crossed the border into Xianfeng, Zhejiang. The Zhejiang provincial government has also transferred two regiments of security forces and part of the Central Army to block them at key points. The Zhang [missing character] brigade stationed in Eastern Fujian has also deployed heavy troops in Shouting and Fuding to prevent the remaining bandits from returning. They have also sent letters to the magistrates of Eastern Fujian, urging them to actively handle the important task of public self-defense, so that the scattered bandits have no place to hide. At the same time, they are promoting education and developing production. (April 8th)</p>

<h3>Relief in Anhui Province: Severe Disaster in the Huai River Basin—Advancement of Funds by the Huai River Commission for Work Relief—</h3>
<p>Wuhu correspondence: The disaster situation in the Huai River basin in Anhui Province is becoming increasingly serious, with Shou County and Huoqiu County being the most affected, followed by Yingshang, Fengtai, and Dingyuan, and then Fuyang, Linquan, and Guoyang. The drought-stricken area stretches for more than 300 square li, affecting approximately 7 million people. According to reports from Hefei and Huoqiu Counties alone, nearly 100 people have died of starvation, which is a serious problem in the current spring famine. Liu Yiyan, Standing Committee Member of the Anhui Provincial Disaster Relief Committee and Director of the Construction Department, has been earnestly implementing the relief plan. The first step is to provide emergency relief, while also finding ways to provide work relief to seek a fundamental solution. After repeated discussions with the Central Relief Committee and the Huai River Commission, a way out was found. In 1932, the China Foreign Famine Relief Committee withheld a batch of relief funds for Anhui Province, which was decided to be used to subsidize the Huai River project, amounting to 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. It has not been allocated to this day. The Huai River Commission then negotiated on its behalf and asked Xu Shiying to contact them nearby. Many letters and telegrams were sent, but unfortunately, the committee had already placed the funds in Shanghai real estate, and it was difficult to convert it into cash quickly. As a result, they agreed to first allocate real estate worth 250,000 yuan to the Huai River Commission to exchange for cash, but the Huai River Commission could not accept it and is still negotiating. However, because work relief in northern Anhui is urgent, it was discussed to have the Huai River Commission temporarily advance 50,000 yuan. This is not enough to dredge the main stream of the Huai River, and it is difficult to even dredge the Huai River. In order to allow the people of the severely affected counties to receive the benefits of work relief, it will be used for the Huai River embankment, selecting the most difficult (because the entire project is over 10 million cubic meters) and important projects for the most subsidies. In addition, there is a special relief measure for Shou and Huoqiu Counties. The Shaopotang water conservancy area in Shou County is being actively developed, and its water diversion project, which was originally opened by the provincial government for a 19-kilometer channel, has been found to benefit many fields this year. The Huai River Commission has allocated 40,000 yuan to continue the work. It is estimated that after the water conservancy area is developed, it will benefit 600,000 mu of farmland, and half of the increased land value will go to the people, and half will go to the government to develop water conservancy in northern Anhui. At the end of last month, a public works agency was established to prepare for construction. At the same time, the county government is rushing to report the land prices as a basis for future valuation. In addition, 80,000 yuan will be allocated from the provincial treasury for the Chenxihu water conservancy area in western Huoqiu, and the Construction Department has sent engineers to complete the survey and will start construction soon. In addition, for the administrative area 4673, the water disaster work relief bonds were requested from the central government and cashed at local banks, with more than 67,000 yuan in cash distributed to the severely affected counties to carry out river works. Furthermore, those who requested loans of stored grain in northern Anhui counties were also accommodated. Counties such as Fuyang, Linquan, Guoyang, and Liu'an were guaranteed by the county magistrates to release all the stored grain, to be collected after the autumn harvest with an additional fee. This can save the disaster-stricken farmers from the exploitation of heavy interest loans and get through this terrible spring famine. (April 9th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Rice Merchants Request Ban on Imported Rice</h3>
<p>The local Rice Merchants Association recently protested to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance regarding a news report that Ningbo merchants were collaborating with Shanghai rice dealers to request the issuance of free rice transport permits to purchase imported rice. The protest stated: "Having read in the newspaper about Ningbo merchants in collaboration with Shanghai rice merchants requesting the Executive Yuan to issue free permits for the purchase of imported rice, we are deeply indignant at this act of harming the nation and its merchants. Upon investigation, the autumn harvest last year in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces was considered good. Even if a few counties lacked rice, adjusting surpluses to cover deficits would have been sufficient. However, individuals with ulterior motives misrepresented the harvest and used the pretext of stabilizing prices to create an opportunity to dump foreign rice. The wealthy merchants of Shanghai and Ningbo, who wield significant economic power, can easily manipulate the market. The dissemination of this news has already had an impact. If this becomes a reality, the harm will be incalculable. In recent years, rural areas have gone bankrupt, and commerce has declined. While there are multiple causes, low rice prices are a major factor. This spring, rice prices have only slightly improved compared to the past. Yet, these individuals, fearing that farmers and merchants might have a glimmer of hope, are willing to promote imported rice, seizing our rice and grain outlets and driving rice prices down beyond repair. If they did not forget that they were Chinese citizens, they would not have done this. This matter concerns the livelihood of the people. The association feels a sense of crisis and urgently requests your ministry to take decisive action to prohibit the transportation of imported rice to alleviate the people's suffering."</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Murdered Male Corpse Discovered Near Guanyin Mountain</h3>
<p>On the 9th, a murdered male corpse was discovered near the small bridge area of Guanyin Mountain (i.e., Tianping Mountain) in Suzhou County. The deceased appeared to be around 40 years old, wearing black clothing and blue cloth trousers. One foot was bare, while the other wore a straw sandal. His hands and feet were bound with hemp rope, and a large rock was tied to his waist with lead wire. There were bloodstains all over his body, suggesting he had been murdered and his body dumped in the river. Local villagers reported the incident to the local police precinct, and the bailiff reported it to the local court. Yesterday (the 10th) morning, Prosecutor Zhang Minsheng, along with court police, traveled to the scene by boat for inspection. The examination confirmed that the deceased was murdered before death and the body was disposed of. The bailiff was ordered to prepare a coffin for burial and a request was sent to the Public Security Bureau to rigorously investigate and apprehend the perpetrator.</p>
<h3>Implementing Door-to-Door Collection of Grain Tax</h3>
<p>Wu County's grain tax revenue is the highest in Jiangsu Province, with annual provincial and county taxes amounting to approximately 1.68 million. The Department of Finance previously determined that from the 19th to the 23rd years of the Republic (1930-1934), grain tax arrears amounted to 550,000, and ordered the county to strictly pursue the collection. Remarkably, 250,000 was recovered, but there were still outstanding arrears. The Department of Finance recently ordered the county government to strictly pursue collection again. As for the grain tax for the 24th year of the Republic (1935), approximately 560,000 remained uncollected, as grain households generally cited disaster losses as a reason for delay. The county magistrate believes that grain tax is the government's sole source of revenue and cannot be delayed with excuses. He specifically ordered the tax collection officials in each township to strictly pursue door-to-door collection starting on the 21st of this month. Those who resist will be taken into custody to ensure the national tax is paid.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Lake Bandits Rob Farmhouse at Night</h3>
<p>Gaodun Port, Xin'an Township, in the third district of Wuxi County, is located near Lake Tai and sparsely populated. Recently, a farmer named Qiu Youlang, who rents land, built a thatched house in the area. With no neighbors, it is a solitary village. On the night of the 9th, at around 2:00 AM, eight lake bandits, speaking in a Jiangbei accent, suddenly broke down the door armed with wooden clubs and flashlights. They dragged Youlang, his wife, and children from their beds, bound them with ropes and nets, and stuffed their mouths with cotton to prevent them from calling for help. The bandits then engaged in large-scale looting, taking away seven dan (石) of white rice, one yuan in legal tender, over a thousand copper coins, as well as clothing and jewelry, resulting in losses of over one hundred yuan. Before leaving, the lake bandits left behind two wooden clubs and iron chisels. The victim, Qiu Youlang, did not report the incident to the county for fear of causing resentment.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Opposes Mortgage Insurance</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local Rice Merchants Association held its spring membership meeting. Over 130 members from the eight sections and all executive committee members attended. The meeting, chaired by Zhao Zixin, discussed the issue of banks implementing mortgage insurance for rice, grains, and miscellaneous grains. The association had previously written to the Chamber of Commerce, requesting them to inform the industry, considering the difficulties merchants face and to promote the market prosperity, that the principle of ensuring the safety of goods be upheld and the insurance be waived. The association proposed that the milling, storage, and oil industries should repeatedly hold meetings to jointly establish a storage fund and insurance reserve, but no firm commitment had been obtained from the industry. Wuxi is a mobile market, completely different in nature from other ports. Rice, grains, and miscellaneous grains have never been insured. Even the banks established in Wuxi, which have been operating for two or three decades, have never had insurance as a precedent for accepting mortgages, nor have they suffered losses due to insurance claims. At a time when farmers and merchants are struggling, instead of providing relief, how can we add to their burden, stagnate the market, and cause merchants to hesitate? Therefore, the principle of insurance is absolutely opposed. However, to ensure the safety of goods, the only option is to establish a storage fund for insurance to strengthen credit and maintain the market. If the industry persists in its views and enforces it, we will have to urge merchants to clear all existing goods and temporarily stop storing new goods, no longer using them for mortgages, to show our determination and seek survival. Any member of our industry who does not comply with this proposal and intentionally undermines it will be boycotted from trading with the entire industry. The atmosphere was tense, and the chairman put it to a vote, which passed unanimously.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Commissioner Zang Inspects Changzhou</h3>
<p>Zang Qifang, the Administrative Inspector of the Wuxi District of Jiangsu Province, recently inspected the counties of Suzhou, Wuxi, Kunshan, and Taicang. On the evening of the 9th, he arrived in Changzhou by train from Wuxi at 8:30 PM. County Magistrate Hou Houzong and Public Security Bureau Chief Xu Shiguang led their teams to the station to welcome him. According to Zang Qifang, the politics of Jiangsu Province are gradually getting on the right track. Such things as the baojia system, opium prohibition, and the New Life Movement and other tasks are very heavy. If they can be done in a solid way, the county administration will definitely become perfect. On the 10th, he planned to visit various agencies and inspect the training situation at the militia training center. If there were cars to directly reach the towns and villages, he also intended to inspect them, but he would have to go to the provincial capital that day.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Jiangsu Province Donation and Tax Supervision Conference</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Province Donation and Tax Supervision Committee held its 15th committee meeting at 2:00 PM on the 10th. Members Gu Ziyang, Yu Xiaochuan, Jiang Hengyuan, Leng Bingqiu, and Han Guojun (replacing Leng) attended. Leng Bingqiu chaired the meeting. The following resolutions were made:</p>
<p>- A letter to the Department of Finance requesting a review of previous reports, noting that items such as scrutinizing budgets, abolishing excessive and miscellaneous taxes, and compensating funds, as well as correcting tax items in accordance with laws and regulations, have not been fully implemented on a case-by-case basis. The committee will not send members to participate in budget review meetings in various counties starting next week. However, the department is requested to pay attention to the original plan of abolishing excessive and miscellaneous taxes, allocating supplementary tax funds, and correcting tax items when reviewing budgets in the future.</p>
<p>- A letter to the Department of Finance requesting the forwarding of the plan to reduce the surtax on land tax for review.</p>
<p>- Approved a letter from the Department of Finance regarding the abolition of the farmers and merchants protection donation item in Chongming County, totaling 13,000 yuan. Since difficulties have been repeatedly stated, the resolution was to send a letter to the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce to verify and handle whether the full amount could be allocated from the stamp tax revenue.</p>
<p>- Regarding Fan Chengen, the township head of Tonghong Township in the second district of Haimen, who was collecting passenger fares from ships in Haimen ports and listing points of malpractice and harassment, requesting to send personnel to secretly investigate and cancel the abusive donations, the resolution was to send a letter to the Nantong District Supervisory Commissioner's Office to send personnel to investigate and handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Junfa Steamer Collides with Fushun Boat</h3>
<p>The Sanwan area (i.e., Pagoda Bay) between Guazhou and Yangzhou is a buffer zone for the Jiangchao tide entering the canal from Guakou. Passing ships often collide and encounter dangers in this area. Yesterday (the 8th), it was reported that the Fuyun-Zhentai Line Qian Steamer, towing the Fushun boat, collided in the bay with the China Merchants' Shaobo Line Junfa Steamer, towing the Deli boat. The Fushun boat's bow was damaged by the Junfa Steamer. The two sides immediately began to argue. After mediation, the Junfa Steamer towed the Fushun to Zhenjiang for resolution, while the Qian Steamer towed the Deli boat to Taixian.</p>
<h3>Pinghu: Bandits Rob During Daylight</h3>
<p>The Zhang family in Fengjia Lane, West Gate, had a modest wealth. They were suddenly targeted by robbers. On the afternoon of the 9th, at around 5:00 PM, two robbers, each armed with a handgun, broke into the house and tied up their tenant, an old woman, and her young maid. They then proceeded to loot the house. Another robber, also armed, stood guard at the door. Neighbors who heard the commotion reported it to the county authorities by telegram. Within moments, both land and water police were dispatched in full force. The area around West Gate was congested, and all four city gates were closed. However, the search continued until late into the night without any trace of the robbers. It was reported that the robbers spoke with a Jiangbei accent, and according to the Zhang family's tenants, the robbers were all wearing neat Western suits.</p>

<h3>A Thousand Willows Outside Scarlet Railing Bridge (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>On a sunny and breezy afternoon, I wandered alone by West Lake. I temporarily forgot the time, forgot the location, and even forgot myself. I looked at the current spring scenery, and saw thousands of green willows reflecting the red bridge area, a truly moving scene! An ancient poem says, "A thousand willows outside Scarlet Railing Bridge." In the past, I often admired it as a good line describing the spring scenery. Today, seeing the actual scene, my admiration has become even more intense. However, this is not just because I saw the real scene of the poem. It is only because I forgot the time, forgot the location, and even forgot myself, that I saw what the poet saw. In other words, the real scene is the poem, so my admiration can become more intense. Otherwise, ominous news of the times permeates everywhere in the world, the monument of national disaster stands on the other side of West Lake, and perhaps human sins fill the cars beside Scarlet Railing Bridge and the buildings in the depths of the willow shade. What is there in the world worth admiring? The refined people of the past liked to manage the lakes and mountains, and often called themselves "West Lake Chief" or "West Lake Master". Having become chief or master, how could they still see the beautiful scenery? I am afraid that they are not as good as a wanderer on West Lake like me, who can forget everything and see the artistic and poetic feeling of the lake!</p>
<p>However, forgetting everything is ultimately difficult for those who carry a physical body. The beauty of "A Thousand Willows Outside Scarlet Railing Bridge" can only make me intoxicated for a moment. In the next moment, it pulls my thoughts to the issue of art. Why does red paired with green make people feel fulfilled? Carefully chewing on this small problem, the wandering heart can be considered to have found a place to settle down.</p>
<p>According to beauty scholars, colors all have symbolic power and can act on people's hearts. In people's actual lives, the symbolic power of color is used everywhere. Now let me first think about the uses of red and green separately: It is said that red symbolizes sexuality, so things related to sex are called "peach-colored". Red symbolizes marriage, so folk customs call weddings and funerals "red and white events". Red symbolizes women, so women were formerly called "red faces" or "red makeup". Women themselves also cleverly use red: some paint their faces red, some paint their lips red, some paint their fingernails red, and even some use bright red as the lining of their clothes, flashing out this dazzling color from time to time during movement, as if telling people: "Although I am calm on the surface, I am holding a flame-like passion inside!" Love and marriage are always joyous and prosperous. Therefore, red can also symbolize dignity. Therefore, folk customs call wealth "red". Chinese people have a special temperament: when accepting money in return for favors, they do not like to be obvious but like to be subtle, they do not like to be direct but like to be indirect. At these times, the help of red can be used. Just wrap the money in red paper, and even if it is delivered obviously and directly, the other party will be happy to accept it when they see the color. This can be said to be a wonderful use of the symbolic power of red! However, red also has the opposite symbolic power: in ancient times, criminals being executed wore red clothes, and red was a symbol of sin. In modern times, red flags are used at auto shows to stop trains from advancing, and red lights are used on the roads to stop vehicles from advancing. Red is a symbol of danger. Righteous flags are mostly red, and red is revolutionary. The Soviet Union uses red flags, so people call the Soviet Union "Red Russia" and guard against her coming to "redden" them. Why is it that money wrapped in red paper is welcomed, while reddening is greatly disliked? There seems to be a contradiction here. But thinking about it from the root, it can also be connected: probably the recognition of the symbolic power of red by mankind has always been fire and blood. Fire is passionate, and blood is dangerous. Passion is often close to danger, and danger is often due to passion. All traits such as passion, vividness, development, prosperity, strength, intensity, and danger can be associated with the colors of fire and blood. In short, red is a symbol of vividness.</p>

After the full amount is collected, the Shanghai Fish Market Co., Ltd. will be organized according to the Company Law. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the inaugural meeting was held on the second floor of the Zhonghui Building. Shareholders attending included: Du Yuesheng, Fang Jiaobo, Kui Yanfang, Huang Zhenshi, Zhu Bin, Xu Yangxian, Fang Guoliang, Liu Tonghua, Xu Zhigao, Wu Xintai, Zhang Zhenfang, Yu Yutang, Chen Zisheng, Jin Zhonghuai, Zhou Weiyue, Shen Shanrong, Ying Yonglin, and Liu Tongde from the iced seafood industry; Xu Heming, Qu Songqing, Sun Guchen, Li Chunfang, Sun Jihou, Qu Jiugao, Cai Heru, Shui Jiamei, Chen Shaolian, Sun Xingpu, Lin Kunhai, Qiu Caizhang, Pan Binghui, Li Mingde, Xu Shanxing, and Shi Meichun from the freshwater seafood industry; and Shen Tianxin, Lin Kanghou, and Wu Xingya representing Wu Huanru, among other business shareholders. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce sent Xu Tinghu, Yan Shenyu, Yu Xingzhan, and Qian Xinzhi, among others, to attend. Minister of Industry and Commerce Wu Dingchang also personally attended the meeting and delivered a speech.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After the meeting was called to order, Mr. Du Yuesheng was publicly elected as the interim chairman. After the formalities were completed, he first made a report, stating: "The Shanghai Fish Market is organizing a joint-stock company and inviting fish merchants to cooperate. Recently, Minister Wu Dingchang of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce came to Shanghai to negotiate and decided to jointly operate the company with a capital of 1.2 million yuan. The government's share is 600,000 yuan, which has been allocated by the ministry. The business share is 300,000 yuan, of which 50,000 yuan has been subscribed by the iced seafood industry, 50,000 yuan by the freshwater industry, and 200,000 yuan by business shareholders not in the fish industry, all of which have been fully paid. The remaining 300,000 yuan will be temporarily paid by the ministry, pending subscription at any time. At that time, a misunderstanding occurred on the side of the iced seafood industry, which expressed unwillingness to join. After Mr. Kui Yanfang's earnest explanation, they agreed to participate. Thanks to the support and cooperation of all parties, success was finally achieved. Today, we are holding the inaugural meeting, and I sincerely hope that everyone will express their opinions to seek the practical guidance of the enterprise. The future is very optimistic."</p>
<p>Amendment of the Articles of Association: Next, the Articles of Association were read out. Article 15 of Chapter 3 originally stated that the number of directors was eleven. Now, after consultation with the ministry, it has been increased to fifteen. The number of government-owned directors was originally six, and the number of business-owned directors was originally five, each increasing by two. The amended provisions will be submitted to the Executive Yuan by the ministry for record. When the Articles of Association were read out, the shareholders believed that there was a need for amendments. After discussion, it was decided that, according to the provisions of Article 48 of Chapter 9 of the Articles of Association, each shareholder should study them in detail and provide them to the board of directors in writing for resolution in accordance with the law, and submit them to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for approval and implementation. The following opinions on amendments were put forward on the spot:</p>
<p>- The right to be elected should be amended in accordance with the Company Law to those who have subscribed to at least three-thousandths of the shares.</p>
<p>- The general manager should be appointed by the board of directors.</p>
<p>Election of Directors and Supervisors: Then, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 15 and 17 of the Articles of Association, the directors and supervisors were elected. First, the chairman read out the official directors designated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce as Xu Tinghu, Wu Xingya, Yu Kaizhan, Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Fayao, Zhang Shenzhi, and Wang Xiaolai, among others, eight people. The supervisors were Qian Xinzhi, Yan Shenyu, and Yu Zuoting, among others, three people. Then, the business directors and supervisors were elected. The chairman submitted a list, which was approved by the meeting. The directors were Du Yuesheng, Fang Jiaobo, Yang Zhixiong, Zhu Jinqing, Tang Chengzong, Qu Heming, and Liu Weijun, among others, seven people. The supervisors were Jin Tingsun and Zhan Kejun, among others, two people. The chairman, standing directors, and resident supervisors will be elected at the first meeting of the directors and supervisors. The general manager and deputy general manager may be nominated by the board of directors. It is rumored that Kui Yanfang may be appointed as the general manager, but it must be approved by all parties and submitted to the board of directors for decision.</p>
<p>Soon to Take Over: The operating regulations of the market were promulgated when Minister Chen was in office. Now that the organization has changed, they will be drafted in more detail. Shareholders in the iced seafood industry are more concerned because it is closely related to their interests, and they have discussed and put forward several opinions for discussion. It was decided that when the regulations are discussed in the future, shareholders of the iced seafood, freshwater seafood, and other industries should each send representatives to attend. The representatives will be separately nominated by the two associations and the business shareholders. Regarding the takeover of the fish market, several directors and supervisors will be elected to handle it after the board of directors is established. The opening date of the market must be determined by the board of directors after the operating regulations are promulgated. At that time, Minister of Industry and Commerce Wu Dingchang will personally come to Shanghai to preside over the ceremony.</p>
<p>Minister's Speech: Then, Minister Wu delivered a speech, saying: "The Shanghai Fish Market was built after two or three years of operation by former Minister Chen. Recently, thanks to the assistance of the fish industry and gentry and merchants, enough shares were raised to hold the inaugural meeting today. As the head of the competent authority, I am very honored to meet with you, and I am especially grateful for your assistance in making the ministry's plan a reality. To make the country strong, we must seek the development of industry and commerce, and the fishing industry is a major national undertaking. In addition to operating the fish market, we must seek the stability of fishermen and the improvement of technology in the production aspect. I am not a fishing expert, but in my personal opinion, to seek the development of production, we must first ensure that sales are determined. If we want to expand sales widely in terms of time and space, we must study and apply large-scale markets and preservation methods. However, our country is used to adhering to the old methods, and it will be inconvenient to change them all at once. But we must look far ahead and adapt to the times to seek future development. I hope that we will cooperate together for the country and the nation to resist the intrusion of foreign forces in international fishing competition. This is the greatest purpose of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in establishing the fish market. As for the organizational method, whether it is state-owned and business-operated, or jointly operated, it is not a problem. Since the government has its purpose, it will not compete with the people for profit. Now that the government and businesses are cooperating, I hope to dispel selfish opinions and cooperate sincerely. The development of the enterprise lies in this. Finally, I congratulate the company on its success."</p>
<p>Fish Merchant's Speech: Next, fish merchant Xu Yangshan expressed his opinions, saying: "The Ministry of Industry and Commerce pays great attention to the fishing industry in order to seek the development of production. I hope that the pirates will be thoroughly eliminated to ensure the safety of fishermen, and I hope that observation towers and radio stations will be established in important fishing ports to report fish conditions at any time, and that banks will be established in coastal cities to provide fishermen with economic assistance. I also hope that the ministry will build large fishing vessels to compete with other countries." Qian Xinzhi expressed his opinions, saying: "The fish market will open soon. This is a newly created enterprise. There will be inconveniences when it is first started, but the future prospects are great. I hope we will cooperate and work hard. In one or twenty years, all parts of the country may imitate and create them. You are the pioneers of reform in the revolutionary history of our country's fishing industry. I wish the enterprise success." Finally, Chairman Du Yuesheng delivered a reply, saying: "Today the company is established, and I thank Minister Wu for his instructions. The ministry is determined to reform the fishing industry, and I have heard that 200,000 yuan has been allocated to help fishing villages. As for eliminating pirates, building observation towers, and building large fishing vessels, I am sure that they will be realized step by step. The fish market will follow the minister's instructions and work hard to cooperate. I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of all the shareholders." The meeting was adjourned at about 5:00 PM after refreshments were served.</p>
<h3>Mining and Financial Adjustment Committee Approves 5 Million Loan</h3>
<p>After Submitting to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for Review, Mining Companies Will Be Notified to Sign Contracts, Continued Acceptance of Applications and Dispatch of Personnel to Provide Guidance for Improvement</p>
<p>The New News Agency reports that since the Ministry of Industry and Commerce established a national currency loan of 10 million yuan from Shanghai banking groups last year, it has established a Mining and Financial Adjustment Committee to preside over the investigation. Mining companies have filled out forms and applied to the ministry for loans. The ministry submitted the applications to the Mining and Financial Adjustment Committee for review. Wang Zhengfu, the chief of the technical department of the committee, dispatched technical experts to conduct on-site inspections of the mines. As of last month, a portion of the investigations have been completed and reported to the committee. The committee convened a committee meeting based on the experts' investigation reports, and after detailed review, approved a total of 5 million yuan. It has been submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for review. In the shortest period of time, mining companies will be notified to directly sign contracts with the banking groups in accordance with the contracts set by the ministry, with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce as guarantor. The applications of other mines are still under investigation. For all the mines that have been approved for loans, the committee will dispatch experts to be stationed in the mines to provide guidance for improvement and development of business methods in order to achieve effective relief.</p>
<h3>Silk Mill Industry of This City Holds General Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussing Matters Such as Purchasing Fresh Cocoons from Zhejiang Province, Deciding the Amount of Cocoons to be Purchased in Shanghai as 45,000 Piculs</p>
<p>The silk mill industry of this city held its second temporary representative meeting at the association hall on North Shansi Road at 4 p.m. yesterday to discuss the newly promulgated regulations of Zhejiang Province regarding the control of silkworm cocoons, as well as matters related to cocoon purchasing. It was decided that a request for an extension of the registration period in Zhejiang Province has already been sent, and further discussions will be held after approval is received. Furthermore, the amount of cocoons to be purchased in Shanghai was decided to be 45,000 piculs. Details of each matter are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives Present: Yesterday, representatives from various silk mills in this city, including Jiang Laixian, Shen Huachen, Yu Gufang, Gu Zhengang, Zhang Peishen (Xiangcheng), Mo Yongqing (Zhicheng), Huang Jiwen, Zhang Qiling (Jiyu), Xu Peixiong (Fuchang), Cao Zhongqing (Xinglun), Mo Wuqing (Qingyuan), Jin Yusong (Houfu), Qiu Zhongcheng (Tongyu), Zhu Jing'an (Yihe), Yao Zilan (Binfu), Tang Yeqin (Shengtai), Cai Fengyan (China), Zhang Yunsheng, Zhang Chucai, Wu Shengsan (Hengcang), Chen Fangzhou (Shoulun), Fan Shunzhi (Yufeng), Jing Kaiquan (Dongxiang), Zhou Jinbao (Yuanji), Zhu Fanghang, and more than 30 others, were present. The meeting was chaired by Shen Huachen, with Hang Zhuoying as the recorder.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After performing the formalities, Chairman Shen Huachen first reported the main purpose of convening the temporary representative meeting, stating briefly that the silk mill industry has suffered considerable losses due to the continuous downturn in foreign trade over the years. The government has issued public bonds to provide relief. In recent years, foreign sales have gradually become active, and the silk industry seems to be reviving. However, the regulations stipulated by the Zhejiang Provincial Silkworm Cocoon Control Committee for this year have many obstacles and impose strict restrictions on cocoon merchants from other provinces going to purchase fresh cocoons. They must first fill out an application and submit it for registration. Only after approval can they pay the deposit and be allowed to purchase. Moreover, the registration deadline is the 15th of this month. The members believe that the time is tight, and it may be difficult to complete the procedures as scheduled. Therefore, the association has telegraphed a request for an extension a few days ago, but a reply has not yet been received, and it is still uncertain whether it will be approved. However, the quantity of fresh cocoons to be purchased and other matters must be discussed and decided upon immediately to facilitate progress.</p>
<p>Resolutions of Various Cases: After the chairman's report, the following cases were discussed: Regarding the proposal to agree on the quantity of fresh cocoons to be purchased by each factory in this city, it was resolved that the quantity of cocoons to be purchased has been agreed upon by 27 factories in this city, and several others are still considering. The currently agreed purchase quantity for this city is 45,000 piculs. Regarding the proposal on how to handle the limited registration date set by Zhejiang Province, it was resolved that in addition to the association having already submitted a request for an extension, all members should expedite the completion of the procedures. Those who entrust the association to register on their behalf should submit their applications to the association before the 14th. Jiang Laixian proposed a request to postpone the payment of the deposit after the registration is approved. It was resolved to postpone the discussion and decide on it at the joint meeting of silk mills in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. The meeting adjourned at about 6 p.m. after the discussions were completed.</p>
<h3>Special Commissioner of the Military Affairs Commission for Tobacco Administration, Ma Liang, to Arrive in Shanghai Tonight</h3>
<p>General Inspection of Smokers in This City to Begin on the 13th, Municipal Public Security Bureau to Send Police to Urge Second-Phase License Renewal</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, in order to assess the performance of local authorities in various provinces and cities in handling tobacco control work and to carry out tasks such as smoker inspections, the Military Affairs Commission has specially dispatched four commissioners from the General Supervision Department of Tobacco Control to inspect various places. Ma Liang, the Special Commissioner for Tobacco Administration Inspection in Jiangsu Province and Shanghai City, has been ordered to depart and first go to Zhenjiang to consult with the Jiangsu Provincial Government authorities on the methods for smoker inspections. This matter has been completed, and he is scheduled to leave Zhenjiang tonight and come to Shanghai to inspect the tobacco control situation in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Smoker Inspections to Begin on the 13th</h3>
<p>The implementation plan for the general inspection of smokers in this city, planned by the Fourth Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, is scheduled to begin on the 13th of this month. During the inspection period, any unregistered smokers in the Chinese or foreign concession areas who wish to quit smoking can register at the district bureaus or offices in each district of the city, or apply by mail (stating the detailed address). The Municipal Public Security Bureau will send them to a smoking cessation hospital for free. If they do not apply voluntarily and are found out by inspection, they will be punished according to law. The sea of suffering is vast, but the other shore can be reached. It is hoped that all smokers will pay attention.</p>
<h3>Sending Police to Urge License Renewal</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau has announced that the second phase of license renewal for registered smokers will begin on April 1st and end on May 31st. In recent days, the number of smokers renewing their licenses in each district has been enthusiastic, but there are still many who are following suit and waiting to see. In order to ensure that the license renewal procedures for smokers are completed on schedule, the bureau has notified each district bureau and office to send police to urge them starting today. According to news from the registration section of the Fourth Section of the bureau, when supplementing the registration of smokers who have been judged or not yet judged, licenses can be issued at any time, without issuing receipts, to reduce procedural hassles and prevent smokers from being replaced or impersonated.</p>

Employees of all agencies under this ministry should actively participate in the insurance to facilitate progress.

<h3>China Farmers Bank Transports Legal Tender Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>Should be Approved to be Exempted from Fees</p>
<p>The Two-Roads Administration received a business circular from the Ministry of Railways stating, "The Ministry of Finance has previously been informed that the China Farmers Bank was established to revitalize rural areas. The Legislative Yuan has discussed and the National Government has promulgated regulations, granting it the power to issue currency. The banknotes of this bank have now been approved to be used in the same way as legal tender, and it has been designated to focus on remote provinces such as Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan. In the future, transportation affairs will inevitably increase, and the mission it bears is the same as that of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. The bank's request to refer to the established case of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications to transport legal tender silver dollars free of charge is hereby requested to be checked and approved." The Ministry of Finance believes that the term "legal tender" originally refers to the banknotes of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. Whether the farmers' banknotes are included has been inquired to the Ministry of Finance for verification. The Ministry of Finance has replied that the term "legal tender" naturally includes the banknotes of the China Farmers Bank. Accordingly, it should be approved. In the future, the China Farmers Bank's transportation of banknotes of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, as well as silver dollars of this bank, should be approved to be exempted from fees to assist them. Now that the farmers' banknotes are included in the legal tender, if the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications transport this type of banknote, it should be handled in the same way as legal tender. Other banks and legal tender exchange institutions should also charge 50% of the cost of transporting farmers' banknotes in accordance with the established case of transporting legal tender to ensure uniformity. In addition to the reply, the bureau has instructed the Vehicle Affairs Office to comply and report."</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhijiang Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhang Talks About Europe and America Promoting Sports, We Are Far Behind, National Arts and Basketball Performances Return with Great Acclaim</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Zhang Zhijiang, the director of the Central National Arts Museum, went abroad last August to study sports and telegraphed the museum and the National Institute of Physical Education to form the Nanyang Expedition Team to promote national arts in various parts of Nanyang in order to raise funds. After a total of eight months, he arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 8:30 a.m. on the Lincoln President, a ship of the Dollar Steamship Lines. A reporter from the Central News Agency recorded the details below:</p>
<p>National Arts Groups Went to Welcome</p>
<p>Zhang and his party of 19 members of the Nanyang Expedition Team arrived at the New Customs Wharf at 8:30 a.m. yesterday. Zhang Ruitang, Li Chengbin, and Li Zimao from the Central National Arts Museum, Pang Yusen from the National Institute of Physical Education, Zhao Tiezhang from the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all staff members of the Shanghai National Arts Museum, the Jingwu Athletic Association, and the Chinese Athletic Association went to the wharf to welcome them. After a brief exchange of greetings, they went to their private residences to rest, while the team members stayed at the YMCA on Sichuan Road.</p>
<p>Inspected Europe and America, Traveled to More Than Ten Countries</p>
<p>Zhang told reporters in the cabin that he went abroad with Peng Shuren and Luo Guanghai last August to study sports for reference. He first went to the United States, then to Europe, including England, France, Germany, Italy, Austria, the Czech Republic, and other countries, and traveled to more than a dozen countries. For five months, he felt that European and American countries were very developed in sports, and their spirit of penetrating the people and developing universally was far behind our country. Even the smallest countries in Europe are more advanced than us. Therefore, if we want to talk about the strength of the nation, we must seek the universal development of sports.</p>
<p>Overseas Performances Return with Acclaim</p>
<p>Zhang continued, "In addition to the inspection, I also promoted our country's unique national arts. At the request of various parties, I occasionally gave performances. I have learned very little, but I can always arouse the admiration and praise of foreigners. Therefore, after returning to China this time, I will set out to inspect various parts of the country and promote the Tao. The first step is publicity. At present, the national arts museums established in various places have not achieved significant results. Therefore, in addition to planning for national inspection and publicity, I will also reorganize the national arts museums."</p>
<p>Staying in Shanghai Briefly, Inspecting the Whole Country</p>
<p>"After my inspection, I telegraphed the National Institute of Physical Education to perform national arts and basketball in the Nanyang Islands to promote publicity and raise funds for the construction of the national arts museum. For more than three months, I passed through Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Jinbao, Ipoh, Taiping, Penang, Manila, Hong Kong, and other places, which aroused the respect and attention of overseas Chinese and foreigners, and gave them a deep impression. National arts are a unique sport in our country and can strengthen the nation. Our eastern neighbors are diligent in learning and never tire of it. Our country should strive to preserve and promote it. I will stay in Shanghai for about two or three days, then go to Beijing, and then go to inspect the whole country on a regular basis."</p>
<p>Basketball Team Plans to Fight Pirates</p>
<p>Li Zhenzhong, the captain of the basketball team, told reporters that the team had traveled to the British Nanyang Islands and the Philippines to perform 34 basketball games. Except for the Philippines, the rest were technically backward. In the Philippines, they fought against the local strong teams and won eight out of six games, which was a good result and attracted the attention of the local people. This trip won eight or nine silver shield awards and more than 10 commemorative flags. They plan to have a friendly match with the pirates in Shanghai, but it will have to wait until after the negotiation. It is said that the National Arts Team also performed more than 40 games, and the results were particularly good. The warm welcome and praise they received were beyond the reach of pen and paper. Some foreigners were afraid to bully overseas Chinese because of this.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Zhijiang returned to China (Central) (Taken by International Press)</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs to Request the Abolition of Qimen Black Tea Control</h3>
<p>Should Request to Revoke the Proposal to Control Transportation and Sales Based on the Qian and Dong Telegrams</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the National Economic Commission, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, and the Anhui Provincial Government yesterday to request the revocation of the order to control Qimen Black Tea. According to the Yangzhuang Tea Industry Guild, Hong Mengpan, Chen Yizhou, and other tea merchants came to the meeting and stated in a panic, "Our association previously worried that the proposal of the Anhui Construction Department to transport and sell Qimen Black Tea was close to control and requested your association to telegraph Beijing and Anhui to revoke this proposal. We received replies stating that it was not control of Qimen Black Tea, and the Anhui Dong telegram stated that there was no decision to control Qimen Black Tea, which would not hinder the tea houses from lending money and there was no need to worry. Based on this, our association boldly proceeded to lend more than one million yuan to Qimen. Now that the Qingming Festival has passed and it is the right time to pick tea, the Anhui Provincial Government suddenly announced the establishment of a transportation and sales committee on the 3rd. According to its regulations, all Qimen Black Tea in boxes will be handed over to the committee for transportation and sales. Only after the tea is sold will the remaining money be returned to the original lender. If they wish to recover the loan in advance, they will have to wait for a review and transfer their loan and interest, and pay a commission of 2%, etc. This unexpected thunderbolt shocked us. Tea houses lend money for legitimate business and only receive 2% commission. The committee wants to take away the boxed tea that has already been advanced, and also wants to take away the tea that has been sold and the money to be collected. Those who want to get back the loan in advance have to wait for a review. The tea houses' blood capital business is almost completely deprived, which is completely contrary to the Dong telegram and puts the tea houses to death. We have repeatedly appealed, but to no avail. Your association is the leader of the merchants, please telegraph the Executive Yuan, the National Economic Commission, and the Ministry of Industry separately to transfer the telegram to the Anhui Provincial Government to immediately revoke the proposal to control the transportation and sales of Qimen Black Tea to ensure the peace of the tea industry, and telegraph the Anhui Provincial Government to observe the facts of the commercial situation and immediately revoke the order to show great faith, uphold the national lifeline, and relieve the merchants' difficulties." The tea houses are a legitimate business and should be protected by national laws. Now, in the name of control, they are engaging in provincial operations, which will bring the tea houses' 70-80 years of business to an end. On the one hand, they show appeasement. The Qian telegram from the Economic Commission stated that the purpose of the meeting was to improve Chinese tea, not to control Qimen Black Tea, and that the status of the tea houses had long been taken into account. The Anhui Province telegram replied that it would not hinder the tea houses from lending money and there was no need to worry. However, the Red Tea Transportation and Sales Association was established at this time, which is no different from trapping people in a pit, leaving the tea merchants with no place to survive. Since the tea houses are a legitimate business, they should have the right to maintain their survival in accordance with the law. It is requested to revoke the proposal to control the transportation and sales of Qimen Black Tea based on the Qian and Dong telegrams in order to show great faith and protect the tea merchants' business. Urgent words, waiting for your telegram, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>Public Burial of Mr. Lim Nee Soon</h3>
<p>His Family Has Expressed Consent, Organizers Telegraph Various Parties to Solicit</p>
<p>Mr. Lim Nee Soon, who has contributed to the party and the country, recently died of illness in Shanghai. In addition to handling the funeral, his family immediately began preparing to transport Mr. Lim's coffin to Nanyang for burial and had scheduled to depart on the 14th of this month. It is now known that old comrades of the revolutionary party, Huang Zonghan, Feng Ziyou, Zhang Yongfu, etc., believe that Mr. Lim was an old comrade who contributed to the party and the country and should not have his remains buried far away in a foreign land, which would be a shame to the party and the country. They have launched a campaign to solicit the consent of important party and state figures from all parties and request a public burial by the National Government.

<h3>Indian Man Drunk and Roaming at Night, Knocking on Back Doors</h3>
<p>Police Intervention Resulted in Assault, Leading to a Forty-Shilling Fine</p>
<p>An Indian man, Amu Sen, relies on lending money for interest due to his small fortune. One night, Amu Sen drank excessively at home, becoming extremely drunk. He took advantage of his drunken state and wandered with a cane between North Sichuan Road and Route des Soeurs. Suddenly, he had a strange idea and walked into the nearby alleys, knocking wildly on the back doors of various houses. For a time, every household was disturbed, and some busybodies added fuel to the fire, causing a great uproar among the residents. This was noticed by Chinese Constable No. 3355 on duty in the area, who considered Amu Sen to be violating the police regulations and quickly intervened. Unexpectedly, Amu Sen not only refused to comply but even assaulted the constable. Fortunately, a Japanese Inspector from the Hongkou Police Station was patrolling the area and stopped him, taking him back to the police station. In the morning, he was sent to the British Consulate for interrogation. After questioning by the British prosecutor, Amu Sen was immediately declared guilty of violating police regulations and fined forty shillings, or thirty days in jail if he could not pay the fine, as a warning.</p>
<h3>Large Bomb Found in Auction House Office</h3>

At first, no one paid attention to it, but when it was discovered to be an unexploded shell, the company immediately called the General Police Station, which sent Western police officers to take the shell away and dispose of it in the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3>Murder Case Solved in the Southern District of Zhaozhou Road</h3>
<p>Wang Laosan Has an Affair with Tang Yitian's Wife, Tang's Nephew Discovers the Affair and is Brutally Murdered</p>
<p>On the 7th of this month, an unidentified male corpse was found in a deserted area at the southern end of Zhaozhou Road in the southern district. The details were reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the case has been solved. Tang Yitian, a Shandong native from Cuqi, Meiceng Road, South City (26 years old), his wife Wu Lindi, 23 years old, from Ningbo, had an affair with Tang Yitian's father-in-law, Wang Chenghe (also known as Wang Laosan, 44 years old, Shandong native). This was discovered by Tang Yitian's nephew, Tang Zhenyou (26 years old), who scolded Wang and tried to catch them in the act. Therefore, Wang Chenghe and Wu Lindi conspired to</p>
<p>Murder Tang Zhenyou.</p>
<p>On the night of the 7th, Wang Chenghe, together with Lao Su, Ge Er, and a person surnamed Jiao, planned to strangle Tang Zhenyou in Lao Su's house and dump the body in the deserted area of Zhou Road. Now, Tang Yitian's brother, Tang Yili (31 years old), has accused Wang Chenghe of murdering his nephew Tang Zhenyou at the Huining Road Police Station. Patrol Chief Chen Yaoshan of the Xiaoning Road Police Station arrested Wang Chenghe's wife, Wang Wangshi, and sent her to the Ximen Branch for interrogation. According to Wang Wangshi's confession, her husband Wang Chenghe and Tang Yitian's wife Wu Lindi fled to 334 Pingjili Road in the French Concession</p>
<p>to stay.</p>
<p>Acting Director Huang issued an order to the Detective Squad Leader Li Xiaobao and Deputy Squad Leader Qian Tianxiong, leading Foremen Yu Ruhai, Detective Yao Renjie, Lu Qingkang, Chen Enrong, etc., to join forces with Chinese and Western detectives from the French Police Station to arrest Wang Chenghe and Wu Lindi, male and female, at the Hexing Inn on Pingjili Road. They were taken to the Ximen Branch for interrogation. The adulterous mastermind, Wang Chenghe, confessed that he was 44 years old and a native of Shandong. He wanted Tang Yitian's wife to be his concubine, but Tang Yitian's nephew Tang Zhenyou found out about it and scolded him severely, so he</p>
<p>harbored resentment in his heart.</p>
<p>That night, he, Lao Su, Ge Er, and a person surnamed Jiao, planned to strangle Tang Zhenyou in Lao Su's house. Lao Su, Ge Er, and the person surnamed Jiao lured Tang Zhenyou to Lao Su's house to drink and talk. At 3 p.m. (on the 7th), Lao Su, Ge Er, and the person surnamed Jiao strangled Tang Zhenyou to death and abandoned the body in the deserted area of Zhou Road, about half a li from Lao Su's house. Afterward, he took his wife Wang Wangshi and Tang Yitian's wife Wu Lindi to the Heyu Inn on Pingjili Road in the French Concession to hide. Later, he sent his wife Wang to the house to get clothes, and she was grabbed by the deceased's uncle Tang Yili, etc., and</p>
<p>dragged to the bureau to report</p>
<p>his whereabouts, so he was arrested, etc. The adulteress Wu Lindi, 23 years old, from Funing, confessed that after her former husband Wang A'gen died, he left behind a seven-year-old girl. Because she had no way to support herself, on the 5th of this month, Lao Su Wang Laosan introduced her to Tang Yitian as his wife for 80 yuan. They got married at Wang San's house and stayed there for two nights. On the afternoon of the 6th, Wang Laosan and Tang Yitian quarreled, and Tang Yitian left. On the morning of the 7th, she heard that nearby</p>
<p>an unidentified male corpse was found.</p>
<p>She did not know that Tang Yitian's nephew Tang Zhenyou said he would fight Wang Laosan, so Wang Laosan dragged her to stay at the small inn on Pingjili Road in the French Concession. That night, she had physical relations with Wang Laosan. Last night, Wang Laosan's wife Wang Wangshi went home to get clothes and was arrested, etc. Acting Director Huang questioned them briefly. The case involved seduction and murder of the husband's nephew, and the situation was serious, so he sent all the defendants and witnesses to the General Bureau.</p>
<h3>Shameless Behavior of Waiter at the Royal Hotel</h3>
<p>Injured a Western Woman's Lower Body with His Hand, Arrested After Discovery</p>
<p>The Royal Hotel, located at 209 Route des Soeurs, is owned by Italians. The hotel occupies a vast area and is located in a quiet area. The internal facilities are quite noble and clean, so Western expatriates who enjoy peace and quiet are happy to stay there. A British couple named Holmes had two daughters and a son. The eldest daughter was six years old, the youngest daughter was four years old, and the son was eight years old. Holmes worked in the capital, so his wife and children did not accompany him and temporarily stayed in rooms 28 and 29 of the Royal Hotel. One afternoon at 6 p.m., Mrs. Holmes had to go to church to pray according to religious custom on Qingming Festival night. After dinner at around 6:15 p.m., she walked to the church alone without her children. Before leaving, she was afraid that her children would be greedy and sleep late at home, so she specifically instructed the Ningo waiter on duty at the hotel, Li Ruiqing (34 years old, residing at 34 Zhengxingli, Dongyouheng Road), to take good care of them and put them to bed early. Li immediately agreed. At around 8 p.m. that night, Mrs. Holmes returned to her residence and saw that her three children were indeed sound asleep. The waiter Li Ruiqing had already gone off duty and gone home to bed. Unexpectedly, at dawn the next day, Mrs. Holmes suddenly heard her eldest daughter sobbing, followed by cries of pain. She was shocked and quickly put on her clothes and got up to investigate. Her eldest daughter tearfully stated that after her mother left the previous night, the waiter Li Ruiqing tried to put her and her sister to sleep. Li picked her up and put her on the bed. Unexpectedly, Li's animalistic nature was aroused, and he inserted his fingers into the girl's lower body for about a minute, causing her pain. Mrs. Holmes was furious when she heard this and, seeing that her eldest daughter had difficulty walking, was even more resentful. She immediately summoned the hotel owner and told him what had happened. At this time, Li Ruiqing was about to take over his shift and did not know that his crime had been exposed. The hotel owner did not show any emotion but secretly reported it to the police station. The police immediately dispatched detectives to arrest Li and take him to the police station. They also sent the girl to the hospital for examination, which confirmed that the girl's lower body had indeed been injured and was red and swollen. She was hospitalized for treatment. Li Ruiqing will be sent to the court for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Tragic Death from Eating Pufferfish</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaobianzi Unfortunately Dies</p>
<p>Wang Xiaobianzi, from Siyang, and his wife Wu, from Ningbo, lived in a dilapidated, unnumbered house behind 49 Yangjiazhai, Pudong. At 10 a.m. yesterday, Wang bought eleven small pufferfish and brought them home to cook. They made six bowls in total. At noon, the couple sat down to eat. Two hours later, their faces turned pale, and they had stomach cramps. Neighbors found out and knew they had been poisoned by the fish. They quickly administered herbal remedies. Wu's poison gradually subsided, and she was saved. However, Wang's poison was too strong, and he died at 4 p.m. The Pudongkang Public Security Bureau was notified and ordered the Ba長 Lu Shunlong to report to the local court for an autopsy this morning.

<h3>Shanghai Amusement Association Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Amusement Association held its inaugural meeting at the Gong Stage at 10 a.m. yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives Present</p>
<p>The inaugural meeting of the association was held at the Gong Stage at 10 a.m. yesterday. Present were Director of the Education Bureau Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Public Security Bureau Cai Jinjun (represented by Nong Qiangfu), Chairman of the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession Wang Xiaolai (represented by Li Ziyang), Wang Longzhang from the City Party Headquarters, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Bing, Zhou Bangjun from the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, Huang Jingwan from Popular Education, and over 700 members from the Comic Monologue Research Association, the Shenqu Opera Research Association, the Su Opera Research Association, the Drama Research Association, the Runyu Society Pinghua and Tanci Research Association, the Yongyu Shenjiang Storytelling Research Association, the Siming Wenci Research Association, and the Huaiyang Dialect Improvement Research Association.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Gong Tuoding, Li Junqing, Liu Ziyun, Shu Xiangjun, Li Bokang, and others were selected as the presidium. After the rituals, Chairman Ding Shoutang reported that the purpose of the association was to improve its own operations and promote social education. Representatives from eight groups began preparing for this last October and received approval from the Party and government. It is only today that it is formally established. He was honored by the presence of guests from all walks of life and hopes that they will continue to assist and guide them in the future so that the association can develop.</p>
<p>Speeches by Party and Government Officials</p>
<p>Next, Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech, stating that the national crisis is becoming increasingly serious, a phenomenon unprecedented in thousands of years. Although China has been conquered twice, once by the Yuan and once by the Qing, the reason was the failure to popularize education and the disparity in knowledge among the people, leading to a lack of unity and oppression by foreign forces. Today, all countries in the world are engaged in popularizing education in order to create strong nations. Therefore, if Chinese citizens want to save the country and seek survival, they must give illiterate masses the opportunity to become literate and educated. The entertainment industry is a teacher close to the masses, and its responsibility is extremely important. He hopes that everyone can understand their own responsibilities, improve social education, and instill popular knowledge in the masses. Next, Wang Longzhang delivered a speech, encouraging them to strengthen their organization in order to accomplish the great mission of their own. Zhang Binghui and Jiang Jianbai then delivered speeches. (The length of the speeches is not recorded.)</p>
<p>Adoption of Association Rules</p>
<p>Next, the association rules were adopted, as well as the proposals to: Submit a request to the Education Bureau that all members of the entertainment industry who have organized research associations but have not joined the association's membership groups should not be allowed to operate in Shanghai and should not be registered; Limit the recruitment of apprentices by all member groups; Assist the government in organizing various central propaganda activities; Establish a children's school; Submit a request to higher authorities to provide specific drama materials; Raise funds to hold amusement festivals separately; Raise donations to purchase aircraft to celebrate Chairman Chiang's birthday; Organize a drama improvement committee.</p>

<h3>Rampant Robberies in the Concessions</h3>
<p>Three Robberies Occurred in One Day Yesterday</p>
<p>Xinzha Road In Xinzha Road, Lane 568, No. 287, four robbers suddenly appeared at about 8 a.m. yesterday. Only one robber had a pistol. Everyone in the house had just gotten up and was washing, so they were all held captive and unable to move. The robber with the gun supervised them, while the three unarmed robbers went to each room and searched thoroughly, turning over boxes and chests without leaving anything out. However, there were no rare valuables in any of the rooms, so the robbers were disappointed and unwilling to leave. They searched again and again, and finally, even better clothes were taken. In total, the robbers stayed in the house for more than two hours, watching the looting until everything was gone before leaving. Afterward, the victim checked his losses, which amounted to more than 300 yuan, and reported it to the Xinzha Police Station, requesting an investigation.</p>
<p>Avenue Road At about 9 a.m. yesterday, four robbers asked for directions at a house with the surname "Mou" at 20 Lane 434, Avenue Road, and lured their way in through the back door. They first threatened the servants with guns and held them captive. Then, they stormed into the hall and rooms, shouting at the owner to stay put in a corner and not move. Two unarmed robbers took the box keys and searched everywhere for about half an hour before leaving. By the time they were chased, they were gone without a trace. The incident was reported to the Xinzha Police Station for investigation. The total loss was estimated at several hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Shandong Road At about 11 a.m. yesterday, a shop assistant from a money exchange shop in Lane 117, Shandong Road, was holding 106 yuan in cash collected from outside and was returning to the shop to hand it over. Just as he entered the lane, several thugs suddenly came up behind him, grabbed him, threatened him with a gun, and snatched the cash he was carrying before running out of the lane. By the time the shop assistant chased after them and shouted for help, they had already escaped. He returned to report to the shop manager, who reported the incident to the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Two Daylight Robberies in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Tongrenchang Fish Shop Robbed of 16,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Xiaodongmen The Tongrenchang Fresh Fish Shop, located at No. 13 Xiaodongmen Street in the French Concession, has been in business for over 50 years and is considered a major player among the fish shops in the 16th Bend area. It has recently built a new three-story building for its business, which is thriving every day, attracting the attention of robbers. At 9:30 a.m. yesterday, four robbers wearing blue cloth shirts and trousers, speaking in local and northern accents, each carrying a pistol, broke into the accounting room on the second floor of the shop. They threatened everyone to remain silent. The staff in the accounting room were settling accounts when they saw this and were immediately stunned. After looting, the robbers calmly went downstairs and fled westward. The manager of the shop, Sun Guocheng from Pudong, reported the robbery to the Xiaodongmen Police Station, which was nearby. Chinese and Western detectives rushed to hunt them down, but the robbers had already disappeared. Upon investigation, a total of 16,800 yuan in French currency was robbed. The shop usually deposits the collected accounts at the China Industrial Bank next door every morning, but yesterday was a tomb-sweeping holiday, the bank was closed, and the money was temporarily kept in the shop, which unfortunately resulted in the robbery.</p>
<p>Ladu Road After receiving the report of the major robbery at the Tongrenchang Fish Shop on Xiaodongmen Street at 9:30 a.m. yesterday, the French General Police Station received another robbery report at 10:30 a.m., stating that four robbers had come to a house with the surname "Mou" at No. 8 Ladu Road and were robbing it. The Western inspector received the news and immediately ordered Chinese and Western detectives on duty to rush to the scene in a police car. However, the robbers had already fled upon hearing the news. Upon investigation, a total of over 20 yuan in large and small silver coins were robbed. The French General Superintendent considered the robbers to be extremely lawless for daring to commit two robberies in broad daylight and ordered all detectives to conduct a thorough investigation to recover the stolen goods.</p>
<h3>Xu Qizhong Bankruptcy Case Second Meeting of Creditors Yesterday</h3>
<p>Bankruptcy Proceedings Temporarily Suspended Due to Separate Lawsuit Filed by Creditors</p>
<p>The Di Yi Special District Court conducted the Xu Qizhong bankruptcy case and convened a second meeting of creditors at 2 p.m. yesterday on the third floor of the China Industrial Bank on Nanjing Road. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Creditors Present</p>
<p>The creditors present yesterday included representatives from Zou Juxing Clothing Store (Zou Kezhong), Saint Anna Dance Hall, Paramount Hotel, Gaohe Women's Shoe Room (Huang Zidong), Yi Yuan Furniture Company (Wang Haifan), Xintong Car Company (Yu Songxiang), Sincere Department Store (Ying Daowei), Li Yun Automobile Company (Zhao Congyan), Wang Shunchang Western Clothing Store (Zhang Xingchang), and twelve others, with a total claim of 14,443.62 yuan (the reported claim was 31,866 yuan). The bankrupt Xu Qizhong, along with his agent lawyer Yu Zhongluo, also attended the meeting.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>The meeting was chaired by Judge Dai Rongduo from the Special District Court and Bankruptcy Administrator Wang Sifang, with Court Clerk Ying Yeping as the secretary. First, Judge Dai reported that because five creditors, including Sincere Company, had filed lawsuits directly with the court, the bankruptcy proceedings would be hindered before the court made a final ruling. At the same time, the amount of claims present at the meeting was also less than three-quarters. Therefore, it was not appropriate to make a decision on the new conciliation plan proposed by the bankrupt, and only an informal discussion could be held. Creditors were welcome to provide as much input as possible for reference. Then, accountant Wang reported on the bankruptcy situation since the first meeting of creditors, the assets turned over by the bankrupt, and the auction of the furniture, clothing, and shoes.</p>
<p>Meeting Situation</p>
<p>After the report, creditor representatives Yue Junwei and Zhao Congyan spoke successively, which can be divided into two points: Since five creditors, including Sincere Company, have filed criminal lawsuits based on Article 154 of the Bankruptcy Law for fraudulent bankruptcy and Article 156, Paragraph 1 for waste, according to Article 131 of the same law, no conciliation plan should be proposed, and the bankruptcy proceedings should be suspended; The bankrupt's family members listed in the new conciliation plan should hand over the 10,000 yuan of Mego Realty Company stock for safekeeping by the court until the litigation is resolved. Finally, the chairman ruled that the case would be proceeded with after the criminal litigation part was completed, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Separate Lawsuit</p>
<p>The reporter also inquired with Bankruptcy Administrator Wang Sifang about the dispute between creditor Ying Huizhen (the owner of Wendi Brothel), who claimed 10,000 yuan, and the bankrupt Xu Qizhong, who only acknowledged 1,000 yuan. The Special District Court held an execution hearing on the 7th of this month and summoned both parties for questioning. As a result, the creditor filed a separate lawsuit with the court.</p>

<h3>Reaction to the Municipal Council's Report on Missing Ballots</h3>
<h3>Statement by Teller Poulsen</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that the report of the Municipal Council's committee investigating the missing ballots in the recent election of councilors was not universally accepted, and the teller was particularly dissatisfied.

He cannot accept the statement in the report that a group of highly paid officials in the room could expect the tellers to accept responsibility for not fully complying with the procedures set forth. The work of the tellers is voluntary, and he feels that he cannot tolerate undeserved blame. Therefore, he intends to firmly raise this point to the Municipal Council.</p>

<h3>Tianjin-Shanghai Inter-City Football Match: Shanghai Suffers a Crushing Defeat of Four to Eight</h3>
<p>Shanghai Team Leads Two to One in the First Half</p>
<p>Tianjin Team Scores Six Consecutive Goals to Turn Defeat into Victory</p>
<p>Today, the Shanghai Team Will Fight in a Joint Match with the Tianjin Military Team</p>
<p>(Tianjin, 10th) The Tianjin-Shanghai inter-city football match was held at the British Stadium at 4:00 PM sharp on the 10th. Tickets were sold for two yuan, one yuan and five jiao, and three kinds. More than 6,000 spectators were crowded. The game ended at 5:30, with Shanghai losing four to eight. It is scheduled to be held at the British Stadium at 4:00 PM on the 11th. The Shanghai team and the Tianjin Military team will have a friendly match. The weather was cloudy and rainy on the 10th, and the stadium was wet and soft. In the first half, Shanghai won two to one. In the first half of the second half, it led four to two. Then the Tianjin team turned it into a tie, and then it continued to be unfavorable and failed four to eight. Xu Wenkui scored two goals for the Shanghai team, and Bosailli and Fun scored one goal each. Jiang Lu scored three goals for the Tianjin team, Siro Ketiv scored three goals, and Johnson and Jones scored one goal each.</p>
<p>Xu Wenkui Opens the Record First</p>
<p>When the inter-city football match started, the Shanghai team was very strong. In the first two minutes, Xu Wenkui was assisted by Dai Linjing and opened the record first. After twenty minutes, Bowserly took the opportunity to send a corner kick and scored one goal. After that, the stalemate lasted until thirty-five minutes, when the Tianjin team escaped its fate and was swept into the middle by Jiang Lu Bian Guan.</p>
<p>Tianjin Team Scored Six Goals in a Row</p>
<p>In the second half, Xu Wenkui recovered a goal at ten yards. Before long, Fun shot in the midst of chaos. At this time, the two sides fought fiercely. Suddenly, the Tianjin team had a penalty of twelve yards, and Siro Ketiv kicked in. Jiang Lu topped one kick and another kick, turning defeat into victory with four to five. Since then, the Shanghai team has been under the control of the Tianjin team, and there have been few opportunities to counterattack. The central defender's assistance was weak, and Siro Ketiv, Johnson, and Jones successively shot three goals. The Tianjin team won this year's championship.</p>
<p>Ade Discusses the Reasons for Failure</p>
<p>Dai Linjing talked about the reasons for the failure, because the venue was wet and humid, and they were not used to kicking, and the running speed was not fast.</p>
<h3>National Sports Basketball Team Returns to Shanghai Yesterday with Honor</h3>
<p>Tang Baokun Talks About the Experience of Conquering the Philippines</p>
<p>The Nanyang Touring Troupe, jointly formed by the Central Guoshu Institute and the National Sports College, went abroad on January 12 to conquer Nanyang, to Malaysia and the Philippines, to perform martial arts and compete in basketball, which was warmly welcomed by local people and overseas Chinese. In particular, the basketball team repeatedly defeated strong teams and shocked Nanyang. The entire group, led by Mr. Zhang Zhijiang, set off from last month to return to China. After staying in Hong Kong for a short period of time, they took the Dalilai Company's Lincoln President Liner back to Shanghai on the 7th and landed at the New Customs Head at 8:30. More than dozens of people, including the Shanghai Municipal Guoshu Hall, the Jingwu Sports Association, the China Sports Association and relatives and friends of the group members, went to welcome them. The Central Guoshu Institute also sent Pang Yusen, Li Zifan and Li Ruitang to Shanghai to take care of everything. It is reported that all the members of the group will stay in Shanghai for a few days before returning to Beijing.</p>
<p>Martial Arts</p>
<p>According to what Mr. Zhang Zhijiang told the Guoguangshe reporter at the Wharf, the purpose of my going abroad this time is to investigate sports and promote martial arts. I went to America first and then to Europe, which lasted for eight months and passed through more than ten countries. Sports in various countries is now progressing vigorously. People all know that sports is the foundation for strengthening the country and strengthening the body. The development is very balanced, and the mortality rate can be reduced, which is something that our country cannot do. Martial arts is extremely popular among overseas Chinese in Nanyang. It is believed that martial arts is the essence of our country and is beyond the reach of other sports. Therefore, after the performance in that country, they were highly praised and invited teachers to teach them one after another. Schools have also added martial arts courses. From this, it can be seen that the reaction of overseas Chinese is very agile and their interest in sports is very strong. He went on to say that the team's basketball players failed to participate in the World Games preliminaries and were therefore excluded. It is now planned to discuss the matter with the election authorities in the long term.</p>
<p>Basketball</p>
<p>According to Tang Baokun, the captain of the basketball team, the players of the team were in excellent physical and mental condition when they arrived in Nanyang, and they were very satisfied with their repeated performances. The most valuable thing was to the Philippines. There was a lot of progress in experience and technology. In the Philippines, he also got Lin Fuzhu from overseas Chinese to join the battle group, and his strength increased rapidly. This gentleman is in charge of the guard and can also fill the center position. His ball skills are excellent and his long shots are accurate. I am afraid that no one in the country can surpass him. The team can have such a record and get this gentleman's strength is not shallow. As for the entire record, except for the two teams that lost to Santo Tomas and Raising, they won all the games. According to the two team members, they are the first-class masters of the Philippines and Malaysia. Many of them have attended the Far Eastern Games and were selected to participate in this year's World Games. The strength can be imagined. However, the team was still able to compete with it and lost only three or four points, while the team won the remaining teams by two or thirty points. It can be seen that the victory was not accidental. (See the local news column for details)</p>
<h3>World Games Football Team to be Produced on the 15th and Depart for Shanghai on the 22nd</h3>

<h3>National Basketball Team's Triumph in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Victorious in Six out of Eight Matches, Defeating the Philippine World Games Preliminary Team; Overseas Chinese Regret Li and Tang's Failure to be Selected for the World Games</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent Yan Wenchubei in the Philippines)</p>
<p>(Manila Special Dispatch) General Zhang Zhijiang, Director of the Central Martial Arts Academy, after touring Europe and the United States to study physical education, sent a telegram to the basketball team of the National School of Specialized Studies and members of the Martial Arts Academy, organizing a Southern Tour Group to meet in British Singapore on a pre-determined date. In Singapore, the basketball team won several consecutive matches (local sports are underdeveloped, and there are no strong basketball teams, only matches with overseas Chinese). Two weeks ago, they arrived in Manila on a German ship with Dr. Wang Chonghui, Peace Envoy. The Consul General, Consul, and representatives of various organizations welcomed them at the pier. Dr. Wang gave a speech, saying that at this time of national crisis, the whole country should unite as one. This trip was purely to urge Hu to go to Beijing out of personal friendship, and he denied any intention to head the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. That evening, he took the same ship back to Hong Kong. Zhang then led the basketball team and the Martial Arts Troupe to stay in Manila, where they were hosted by the Chinese Basketball Federation. They arranged matches with various universities in Manila, totaling eight quick matches, with six wins and two losses. Their results are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Looking at the above results, although there were minor setbacks, they do not detract from their great achievement in defeating the enemy. However, there are several points that must be mentioned to inform the domestic sports community:</p>
<p>Philippine Newspapers Praise: Philippine basketball has maintained its championship title in all previous Far Eastern Games. In recent years, Chinese basketball teams have launched southern expeditions without success. This time, the situation was different for the host and guest, and they came south alone, fighting hard for more than ten days, and achieved such great results. It is fitting that the Philippine newspapers praised them highly, saying that Chinese basketball has made great progress. The SamBela College, the Philippine basketball champion of this year, feared damage to its reputation and temporarily hung up the "no contest" sign. (Originally, the sixth match was scheduled against the SamBela team. Seeing the victory in the match against the Xian Dao Ma team, half of which was due to unfair referees, the team feared damage to its champion reputation and temporarily changed the agreement.)</p>
<p>Excellent Discipline: All famous athletes tend to be unrestrained. Some athletes in the Far Eastern Games even regard dance halls as basketball courts. After midnight, they are in a state of ecstasy. Due to lack of adequate rest, they appear dazed when they go to the basketball court every other day. A certain tennis player (not during the Far Eastern Games) had hopes of winning the championship the year before last, but unexpectedly lost in the final due to this drawback. This time, because the leader was General Zhang Zhijiang, who deployed with military discipline, the players and members of the Martial Arts Troupe did not smoke, drink, or enter dance halls. They slept at ten o'clock and got up at five o'clock for training, without any arrogant habits. The travelers in the YMCA where they stayed also praised them.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin's Guest Appearance: Only six players came this time. Tang Baokun and Li Zhenzhong were veterans who attended the Far Eastern Games. Their technical performances were varied and won applause from many Chinese and foreign spectators. The others were also strong and accurate in shooting. However, they suffered from a lack of reserves to support them. The lone army fought hard and was extremely tired. Fortunately, Lin Tianzhu, captain of the Chinese and Western Alumni Basketball Team and the only basketball star among the overseas Chinese, joined in the battle every game. Lin was familiar with the sports situation here. He knew who in each team was strong and who was good at which skills, so he was suitable for both offense and defense. Sometimes, he even turned defeat into victory. In all fairness, Lin's hard work and achievements are no less than those of Tang and Li.</p>
<p>Tang and Li are Admirable: Seeing their victory over the Philippine team selected to participate in the World Games this time, the skills of Tang and Li are truly admirable. However, it is heard that Tang and Li were not selected for the World Games team announced by our country because they did not participate. The overseas Chinese community regrets this very much. It is heard that the Manila Chinese Basketball Federation, which is in charge of hosting the competition, has sent a letter to Dr. Wang Zhengting, asking him to consider adding the two players Tang and Li so that they can display their talents.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang's Opinion: Wushu (Martial Arts) is a national skill passed down in our country for thousands of years. It is only because of deep-rooted sectarianism that everyone keeps their secrets, which prevents it from becoming widespread. According to Zhang Zhijiang, Director of the Martial Arts Academy, who has repeatedly spoken at welcome meetings, (A) According to the mortality rate survey in various countries around the world, the rate is fifteen per thousand people. However, in China, it is thirty. If we calculate with a population of four hundred million, six million more people die each year than in other countries. If the funeral expenses are fifty gold, the total will be three hundred million gold. Such a loss of population and such an economic loss are due to not knowing how to exercise and maintain good health in peacetime. Promoting Wushu is intended to remedy this shortcoming. (B) The latest ball games and various sports require considerable venues. To build a gymnasium, it costs tens of thousands at most and thousands at least. Currently, the people are poor and the country is exhausted. It is not easy to raise funds even in cities, let alone in rural areas. However, Wushu can be practiced anywhere and does not require sufficient economic resources. (C) Practicing new-style sports and developing good skills is only possible in the golden age of youth. Once past middle age, there is no way to run on the field. However, Wushu becomes more refined with age. During the Nanjing performance competition, an old man over seventy years old took the stage to show his skills and overwhelmed the crowd. (D) New-style sports can only temper the physique. However, if Wushu is mastered, one person can be equivalent to a hundred. It is not only healthy but also self-defense. (E) New-style sports require a group. For example, tennis requires at least two people. However, Wushu is convenient for individuals and can be practiced anytime, anywhere. (F) Japan's Bushido (Way of the Warrior) is taken from a part of our country's Wushu. During the January 28th Incident, the large-sword team suffered a great loss when the two armies engaged in close combat. Therefore, they are now heavily recruiting Wushu masters from our country to go to teach in Japan. They are promoting it with national strength. If our country does not organize and develop it, in another thirty years, we will have to seek the true inheritance of Wushu from the Japanese.</p>
<p>Martial Arts Performance: After each basketball game, there is a martial arts performance, with agile movements, flashing swords, raising the martial spirit of many overseas Chinese. Leaders in the overseas Chinese community, such as Yang Qitai, President of the Overseas Chinese Education Association, Su Xingqian, Principal of the Chinese and Western School, and others who are proficient in this skill, have all joined the performance.</p>
<p>Entertaining Foreign Guests: The Consul General and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce specially arranged a date at the Oriental Club to invite military and political figures from the United States and the Philippines to visit. Philippine Vice President Hoesmin invited important military and political figures to attend. While they were confused, they kept applauding and shouting "Bravo!" It is heard that the overseas Chinese community is very excited about Wushu and is preparing to set up a branch of the Martial Arts Academy.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Sino-British Pistol Shooting Competition</h3>
<p>Both Sides are Actively Preparing; Mayor Wu Donates a Silver Cup</p>
<p>The fourth Sino-British International Pistol Shooting Competition is underway with active preparation on both sides. Mayor Wu has specially donated a large silver cup to show his support. In the previous three competitions, the victories all belonged to China. Therefore, the British side intends to gather its best athletes and is determined to restore its honor. Veteran Bernal will also personally participate. The selection of the Chinese team is being conducted strictly. According to rumors, the main players are still Li Gongying and Shen Lince. If they can come to Shanghai, they will definitely participate. Other good players such as Zhang Yingda, Hu Changyuan, Ding Mingyi, Zhu Qiliang, and Bao Qiyun are also likely to participate. The date of the competition will be decided in a few days.</p>
<h3>Davis Cup American Zone Preliminary Round: Australia Wins by Default; Cuba Withdraws</h3>
<p>(National Telegram from New York, 7th) Today, the American Davis Cup Committee announced that the Cuban Davis Cup team has withdrawn from the competition against Australia. In this way, Australia will compete with the winner of the United States-Mexico match. The United States-Mexico match will be held continuously for three days in Houston, starting on Friday. The winner of the American Zone will go to England for the inter-zone final.</p>
<h3>Donghua and Yu You Compete Separately Today</h3>
<p>Yu You Faces the Jewish Team; Donghua Faces the Shell Team</p>
<p>Today, Yu You B forfeited to the Youth Team. Tomorrow, the Portuguese Team will forfeit to the Donghua West Union Football Club. Today, there are a total of four matches. In the Group A match, the Yu You Club will play against the Jewish team. It is expected that Yu You will win. In another match, the Donghua Club will play against the Shell team. Although Donghua's main players, Dai Linjing, Gu Shangxiang, and Guan Xun'an, are attending the Tianjin-Shanghai inter-port competition, it will not be difficult for them to defeat the mediocre Shell team. In the Group B match, the Youth Team will play against Yu You B. The two teams have the same score in Group B. Originally, the meeting of these two strong teams could be watched. However, Yu You B forfeited due to some reason, and the Youth Team won without effort. As for tomorrow's schedule, the Donghua Club will play against the Portuguese Team in Group A. The Portuguese Team forfeited. The Yu You Club will play against the Western Chamber of Commerce. There may be a fierce battle. The schedule for today and tomorrow is recorded below:</p>

<h3>Inspection Group from Hangzhou Art College Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The 1936 graduation class inspection group of the National Hangzhou Art College, which departed from Hangzhou on the 10th of last month, traveled to more than a dozen important cities and towns in North China, including Shanxi, Beiping, Yungang, Luoyang, Longmen, and Kaifeng. They conducted a more detailed inspection of the ancient art objects left in each place, and the materials obtained by the members of the group were also quite numerous. The original planned work was completed yesterday and the day before yesterday, and they came to Shanghai from Kaifeng via Beijing last night and stayed at the North Station Hotel.

<p>School Survey</p>
<h3>General Overview of the British School in Shanghai (II)</h3>
<p>— Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>The school's buildings are quite magnificent and grand. The total value of the school's assets is over 530,000 yuan. The school building has four floors with an automatic elevator for easy access. There are nine regular classrooms, and specialized classrooms for physics, chemistry laboratories, music, drawing, a library, a gymnasium, an auditorium, and a playground. There are also the principal's office, faculty room, student lounge, student dining hall, restrooms, and drinking fountains, all of which are readily available. The classrooms have good lighting and ventilation. Cloakrooms are mostly located inside the classrooms. Each classroom is equipped with radiators for heating in the winter. Furthermore, the number of students in each classroom is very small, with a maximum of only twenty, so the air in the rooms is always fresh and plentiful.</p>
<p>The facilities in each classroom for each grade and subject are also quite complete, with the total value of all equipment in the school exceeding 85,000 yuan. The desks and chairs in the classrooms are all individual, and of novel design. The physics and chemistry laboratories are equipped with a full set of instruments and experimental materials, as well as a small film projector and a magic lantern for showing various scientific films and slides. Between the physics and chemistry laboratories, there is a lecture hall dedicated to lectures. The drawing room is equipped with specialized desks and chairs for drawing. The gymnasium's facilities can be considered among the best in Chinese middle schools, and will be described in detail in the section on sports facilities. Although the auditorium is not large, it is very grand. The stage is beautifully decorated, and the stained glass windows on both sides add a touch of old English style. The student dining hall is elegantly decorated, and the interior tables, chairs, and utensils are clean and hygienic. The student restrooms are separated into areas for younger and older students, and the interior is completely tiled. They are also equipped with automatic deodorizer dispensers and soap dishes. When one is inside, there is no smell of odor.</p>
<p>However, there is one shortcoming to the school's buildings, which is the unsuitable location. The school is located in the central district of the International Settlement, while most British residents are in the western district of the International Settlement, so many children who enroll find it inconvenient. Although the school provides buses for students to use, it is still difficult for younger children. After the completion of the school's new buildings, it should have been able to enroll more children, but due to the unsuitable location, the number of students has not increased significantly. For the past five years, the total number of students in the school has remained around 150. The school is currently planning to move to the western district to further develop, but due to various reasons, it may not be easy to do so for the time being.</p>

<h3>How to Raise a Good Child</h3>
<p>— Lu Gu Wenshu</p>
<p>We all know that Mencius advocated that human nature is inherently good, and Xunzi advocated that human nature is inherently evil. However, if we followed Mencius's argument, then the world should be full of sages and virtuous people. If we followed Xunzi's argument, then the people of the world would all become thieves and villains. But in fact, there are good people and bad people. What is the reason for this? Because when a child leaves the womb, their nature changes with the different environments they encounter. A good environment makes them good, and a bad environment makes them bad. There are very few exceptions. And the first environment that children encounter when they come into the world, which can also be said to be the most important environment in their lives, is the family. Therefore, the family has a great relationship with the future success or failure of a child's entire life. We mothers are the only backbone members of the family, and we naturally bear great responsibility for our children's future. We must create a healthy body and mind and superior personality in their first environment, so that they will all become perfect citizens and loyal social servants. As for what methods to use to achieve this goal, according to the author's observation, it can be divided into the following points.</p>
<p>1.  Leading by Example: Children are very good at imitation due to physiological reasons, and because their judgment is too immature, they always think that everything we adults do is right and reasonable, so they like to imitate us very much. For this reason, we should lead by example, setting good examples for children to see, so that what they see all day long is noble behavior, and what they hear are gentle and kind words. The child's personality will advance at the same time as his ability and wisdom. Conversely, if we parents spend all day playing cards, smoking, drinking, and setting all kinds of bad examples for them to see, it is simply painting a layer of bad impressions on their pure and sacred little minds. The degree of danger is imaginable.</p>
<p>2.  Encouragement Method: If children have a certain shortcoming and we want to correct them and lead them onto a good path, but they cannot immediately comply, then the best way is to use words or other means to encourage them and lure them onto this good path. This method is more effective than any forced or threatening methods, because forced and threatening methods only work on timid children, and the effective period is very short.</p>
<p>3.  Discipline Method: If a child commits a mistake, discipline is essential. However, the method of discipline should be determined according to the situation. If the mistake is trivial or unintentional, then only a slight reprimand is necessary. But if it is a serious or repeated intentional mistake, then we should use a serious attitude and severely punish them (not in public) so that children remember that doing evil will be punished, and they will never dare to do it again. At the same time, it is best to use the encouragement method again. This way, I can guarantee that there will be no mistakes.</p>
<p>Raising good children is one of our mother's natural duties, and which mother does not want her children to learn well? So, mothers who want to have good children may want to try it.</p>
<h3>Women's Reading Material in Japanese Newspapers</h3>
<p>— Yifa</p>
<p>Women's education in Japan is widespread, and women use newspapers and magazines for leisure after household chores. Each Japanese newspaper has a family column or a women's column, which is a special reading material specially set up for women. The content is not far from each other, and there are no special new-style publications.</p>
<p>In the first few days of the beginning of each month, the women's columns of various newspapers have a calendar of events in the home for that month. It details memorial days, festivals, customs, and habits. It is not difficult for women who are new housewives to follow the calendar. Japanese women mostly do their own cooking and laundry, and there are few types of dishes. Therefore, women cannot cook novel dishes to offer to their husbands. This is what ordinary Japanese women consider to be a depressing thing. Therefore, the newspapers have timely cooking methods every day, sometimes with a few Chinese dishes such as braised pork meatballs and stewed carp. Fortunately, they have all learned Chinese-style cooking in girls' schools, and there is no difficulty. Women who graduate from girls' schools can at least cook a bowl of fried rice with eggs, but Chinese women may not be able to do it.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Japanese women pay more attention to makeup than Chinese women. On the streets, you can only see women with thin eyes and red lips, and the white powder on their faces and necks is piled up like a plaster wall. Even middle-aged women in their thirties and forties and waitresses are heavily made up. The supplements naturally cater to their preferences, and often publish various makeup methods. The research on applying rouge and powder often occupies a large space. Japanese women's makeup mostly takes Paris as an example. Correspondents stationed in France have to assume this responsibility and introduce Parisian makeup techniques to Japan. Although Japanese women can be thrifty and hardworking, they spend more money and time on makeup than Chinese women. However, the makeup materials they use, such as floral powder, rouge, and perfume, are all domestic products, and they do not take pride in using foreign goods.</p>
<p>Women's and children's clothing is also what women pay most attention to. Children's clothing tends to be Western-style, simple to make, and can be made by themselves. In addition to introducing photos of Western popular clothing from time to time, women's clothing introduces new fabrics and supplies, which is nothing more than an obligatory advertisement for large companies. The status of Japanese women is similar to that of old-fashioned women in China in the past. Therefore, in addition to paying attention to household chores and personal decoration, education, and childcare, they do not need anything else. Therefore, discussions on women's issues in the newspapers are rare.</p>
<p>Some newspapers have a reader's mailbox in the women's column to answer various questions. For things like women being abandoned by their husbands, or husbands not caring about the upbringing of their children, and women wanting to leave their families, abandoning their children, and making a living on their own, the editors always persuade them to be patient, to take their husband's family and children as the most important, and not to only pay attention to personal happiness. In the words, it can be inferred that the editors of women's reading materials understand Japanese women. Recently, a newspaper has been publishing daily the ugly acts of Tokyo girls being teased in public by male students and old gentlemen on the road or in trams, which is indeed meaningful. Other things such as the introduction of happy families and the praise of working women are also very practical and welcomed by readers.</p>
<h3>The Female Sedan Carriers of Suzhou</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>Anyone who has traveled to various mountains in Suzhou, such as Tianping Mountain and Lingyan Mountain, will generally have a deep impression of the female sedan carriers that are not easily seen elsewhere. Especially for Suzhou women, who are known for their gentleness and weakness, they actually carry heavy burdens on their shoulders and climb over the mountains as if walking on flat ground, and they must all be amazed.</p>
<p>Indeed, the female sedan carriers in the countryside of Suzhou are worth writing about. Every female sedan carrier has a chestnut-colored skin tone, what city people call chocolate, coffee, or sun-tanned. Their legs and arms are very strong. Although their waists still maintain the curves inherent to women, they are lined with broad shoulders and buttocks, fully expressing signs of health. This is fully in line with the conditions of healthy beauty that urban people talk about. However, "healthy beauty" is not something that these female sedan carriers can understand. Their only purpose is to use labor to exchange the money in the pockets of "masters," "madams," "gentlemen," and "misses" to supplement their livelihood.</p>
<p>We should not look at these female sedan carriers, who are always laughing and giggling, and think that their lives are very optimistic. In fact, their "hee-hee-ha-ha" is because of the tourists who "spend a little money and come out to find some fun." If it were not for their skill in "hee-hee-ha-ha" so much, they might not be able to get the meager amount of pay they now have, which is not enough to supplement their poor family life.</p>
<p>"Female sedan carrier" is just a name given by tourists. In the poet's pen, they may be written as "girls carrying mountain sedan chairs." But this is irrelevant to reality. Because these female sedan carriers only regard carrying sedan chairs as a side job, only serving tourists in the spring and autumn seasons. (Of course, if there are tourists in the summer and winter, they will also carry them, but there are very few tourists who travel in the severe cold and heat.) Their proper profession is farming, working in the fields like men in other places. The reason is that in those places, husbands can spend their days and years living a "lazy bug" life, putting all the burdens of life on their wives' shoulders.</p>
<p>In these small villages near the famous mountains of Suzhou, the most developed are teahouses, taverns, and opium dens. Young men spend the whole day in them. When they are happy, they can also gamble happily for a while. The money spent in this way is not earned by their own hard work. At least 90% of it is squeezed from the wives who sell their labor. Naturally, the seven things to open the door in the family, needless to say, are completely maintained by the wives.</p>
<p>From a formal point of view, these wives who sell their labor to support their husbands' food and drink are, no matter what, their husbands' slaves. But in fact, the husbands are supplied with food and drink by the wives, which clearly means that the wives are in the position of masters. But the mutually masters and servants can live in peace, and can maintain this system with quite a history. This must be said to be a miracle in the gazetteer of Suzhou customs. As for how this social system came into being, the author, although a Suzhou native, does not know the details.</p>
<p>But, whenever I see these female sedan carriers, I always feel that this occupies a considerable position in women's issues.</p>
<h3>Please Misses, Do Not Repeat My Mistakes</h3>
<p>— Junpeng</p>
<p>Miss Lu is a country girl, and she absolutely knows nothing about what is modern or what is era. But she can farm, spin, weave, and cook, etc. One month ago, I don't know why, her husband suddenly wanted to divorce her. Therefore, this lady, by her husband and lawyer, set up a trap for an uneducated and weak woman to jump into, and being fooled was a matter of course. I feel really sorry for her! So I beg the editor of this magazine to lend me a corner to shout out to everyone.</p>
<p>The facts are like this: On a certain day of a certain month, her husband took her to Shanghai to play. So she went to the inn designated by her husband and lawyer, etc. (Because she is illiterate, she doesn't know what the inn is called.) After arriving, the lawyer took out a book of divorce and read the articles of the divorce to Miss Lu, who was illiterate. But because she was illiterate, how could she remember the many detailed articles in the divorce book? Naturally, she forgot them all. Then, under the coercion of her husband and lawyer, etc., she put her fingerprint on the divorce book. Alas! How could she know that putting her fingerprint would cause such a big mistake of dissolving the marriage? Later, her husband's conscience was still good. He bought a pair of fancy leather shoes, bought some clothing materials, sealed thirty yuan in banknotes, and packed a bag of clothes and sent her back to her natal home, saying, "You don't have to come to my house again in the future." So she had to slowly return to her own home. After repeated inquiries from her parents, she learned that her husband's family would provide her with a subsidy of fifty yuan per year, totaling one thousand yuan, to be paid off in twenty years. But such small amounts, and with no children, how could she use these fifty yuan to support herself? Now the cost of living is so high, how can she maintain herself? Who will she rely on after twenty years? Can her parents support her until she dies? When she took out this divorce agreement to look at, she realized the articles on it, but the rest I will not go into detail. Her parents had no way to help their daughter, and could only sigh in vain.</p>
<p>Dear sisters! Do you have common sense about fingerprints? You must know that putting your fingerprint is very important! Because the fingerprints of tens of thousands of people are tens of thousands of different. If you put your fingerprint, you will not be able to deny it, and it will be legally effective. I hope that literate sisters can tell the facts of Miss Lu that I talked about today to illiterate women, so that they will not repeat Miss Lu's mistakes. This way, I will not fail the purpose and value of making this cry for Miss Lu.</p>
<h3>A Sketch of Girls' School Life</h3>
<p>— Qifeng</p>
<p>In the dormitory's washroom:</p>
<p>A group of misses are busy putting on makeup and dressing up. Fragrant powder, lipstick, rouge, face powder,... fill a long wash table.</p>
<p>"Hehe! Lingling! Lend me the mirror to take a look. Look, have I put on too much face powder?"</p>
<p>"Haha, you look like a big butt, why are you showing it to Old Ma?" Bailing Wu Ling's words.</p>
<p>"Little devil! Rotten tongue! Hmph!" The big-sized Xue's scolding.</p>
<p>"Li, Chen's, are you going to the Lianhua Grand Theater to watch a movie today?" Qian's pretty question.</p>
<p>"Hey! Who's going with him!" Li's answer.</p>
<p>"Oh my! Falling flowers are intentional, but flowing water is merciless; alas, alas!" Hui cries sadly for Chen!</p>
<p>"Hey! Everyone be quiet, who took my lipstick?" The big-sized Xue shouts.</p>
<p>"Oh! Look, water splashed on my socks!"</p>
<p>"Damn, look." Fen's eyebrow was touched by Mei's hand and was drawn on her temple by the touched hand.</p>
<p>"Haha, look, Fen's eyebrow is growing on her temple!" Bailing and Ling clap their hands and say loudly.</p>
<p>Then everyone laughed for a while.</p>
<p>When the makeup and dressing are almost done.</p>
<p>The class bell rings loudly. So a group of misses quickly pack up. After packing up, they take their textbooks and go to the classroom together to attend Mr. Yu's party ideology class.</p>
<h3>Repaying Mother's Kindness</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>"Who says that a mere inch of grass can repay the warmth of spring?" A mother's kindness is boundless, and it is truly difficult to repay. Although Confucius once said, "Serve them with propriety while they are alive, bury them with propriety when they die, and sacrifice to them with propriety"; and also "nourish their mouths and bellies, and nourish their minds," I still feel that it is impossible to repay even a fraction of my mother's kindness. But there are some people who are very clever and have come up with a way to "repay mother's kindness." But is this method to make his old mother happy? Is this to personally repay the kindness of his old mother's birth? Now I might as well write it out for the public to review.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I went to Jiangwan to play, and happened to encounter the villagers holding a festival on the way. The sound of gongs and drums was loud, and the hard plaques were in pairs, which was very imposing. Then the deacon Ma dressed up like a martial arts actor on the stage; the yamen runners glared their eyes straight, and were a bit ghostly, which was also funny. Then there were a dozen teenagers, half wearing a single shirt and half naked, which was really commendable in this cold weather. Looking at their bare arms, they used fine crochet needles to densely crochet inside the skin; this doesn't count, and some of them hung incense burners weighing more than a dozen pounds below, and some hung golden gongs, knocking as they walked. The thin arm skin was hung by heavy things, and the blood seemed to be torn off. Sweatballs hung down on their foreheads like soybeans, but they still pretended to be calm and leisurely. It was really funny to see. I asked the bystanders watching the excitement, is this a sign of martial spirit? They shook their heads and said in unison; "This is repaying mother's kindness! When people do this in front of gods and Buddhas, the kindness of their mother's upbringing is repaid!"</p>
<p>I came back and thought about it carefully. This kind of "repaying mother's kindness" actually overturned Confucius's theory that "the body, hair, and skin are received from one's parents, and one dares not to damage them": and in fact, when his old mother sees her own son doing this, is she laughing loudly? Or is she secretly hurting in her heart?</p>

<p>The Road to Health</p>
<h3>Healthy Beauty Methods</h3>
<p>— Yan Shi Manzhu</p>
<p>The trend of the times has turned to healthy beauty. Healthy beauty is true beauty. Without powder and rouge, start with physical exercise. Originally, decorative beauty, on the contrary, conceals true beauty, and is prone to acne, blue marks...</p>
<p>I used to dislike exercise. All I did all day was embroidery, cooking, and holding babies. My body became thinner and thinner, and my face grew clusters of cells. When I pinched them with my fingers, rice-grain-like objects came out of my face, and my pores gradually enlarged. My complexion was dark, and my appearance gradually deteriorated. Later, I got an effective prescription from Sister Lü Qi, and after practicing it for not long, the spots disappeared, my cheeks were full, my skin was delicate, and my color was red in white, without any traces of grease and powder, with natural true beauty. Today, I will introduce it to my sisters. I hope you don't think it's useless because the procedure is simple! This method is entirely based on physiological functions, which can dredge blood flow, restore metabolism, improve muscles, promote beauty, and maintain physical health. Those who practice this method for the first time must be persistent within a month and cannot be interrupted, otherwise, the functions will be completely abandoned, which is a pity!</p>
<p>Every morning after washing, follow the methods below and practice them one by one before doing other things:</p>
<p>Raise both hands forward in parallel, keep your toes on the ground, and lift your heels for half a minute.</p>
<p>Stand up straight, stick out your chest, spread both hands left and right into a cross shape, then clench your fists tightly, clench your teeth at the same time, inhale with your nose and stop, and do it for five seconds. When doing it, try to move your fists to the back, so that the muscles of your whole body tremble, like stretching your waist.</p>
<p>Rub your hands around your neck three times.</p>
<p>Use two fingers to pinch the left and right sides of your throat ten times (it is qualified if you can hear a slight swallowing sound in your ears).</p>
<p>Use your left and right fingers to rub your left and right ear roots, gradually move them to your cheeks, nose, forehead, and the top and bottom of your lips, and repeat it for about a minute.</p>
<p>Open your mouth wide and stick out your tongue, do it three times.</p>
<p>Rotate your head to the left (to the extreme) and then to the right (same). Do it three times in total on the left and right.</p>
<p>Change your hands and insert them into your waist, keep your lower body straight, and lean your upper body to the left, gradually move forward, right, and backward. Do it once.</p>
<p>Morning meal.</p>
<p>It is best to take a powerful blood tonic at the same time, which must also have the effect of clearing the blood. This method is most effective when practiced in early spring or autumn and winter. A few days after practicing it, there may be small particles like breadcrumbs on the face, which is caused by excessive rubbing. After practicing it for a few more days, it will disappear naturally.</p>
<p>Special Feature of This Newspaper</p>
<h3>Madam Huang Xing: Thoughts on Modern Women</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Education is a fundamental task; everyone should use their abilities to serve society!</p>
<p>Madam Huang Keqiang is a capable woman,</p>
<p>a hardworking and persevering stalwart in women's circles. After my conversation with her, I felt that this compliment was indeed very appropriate. During my tour of the capital, I visited her one morning at nine o'clock. I drove to the "First National Memorial Poor Children's Education Center." The old gatekeeper nodded and greeted me. After the reporter explained the purpose of my visit, he happily led me into the reception room. After a short wait, the old man announced that the director would see me. I then walked through several corridors and saw many orphaned children. Some were working, some were jumping, all were full of energy, and they were all well-mannered when they saw guests. The unfortunate children who had received education were indeed much more fortunate than those who had dropped out of school. On the wall were two lines of large characters: "No student does not work," "No apprentice does not read." It is said that these were inscribed by Madam Huang, and her aim in educating poor children is evident from this.</p>
<p>In the reception room, the reporter saw a photo of Madam Huang giving a speech at a welcoming party for overseas Chinese in Honolulu, a territory of the United States. It aroused the passionate spirit of the audience. One can imagine the grandeur of Madam Huang's revolutionary spirit in those years. At this moment, Madam Huang slowly entered the room, with a kind smile. After a brief exchange of greetings, she began the following conversation:</p>
<p>"Madam, you have been running the Poor Children's Education Center for many years. You must have a strong interest in it. Please tell me about the process."</p>
<p>She seemed to have many feelings about the affairs of the Education Center, because she had encountered many setbacks in the process. Even now, she has not been able to stabilize the affairs of the Education Center. All sectors of society have not been able to provide sufficient assistance. More than 360 unfortunate children are still in a precarious situation. This is her greatest regret! For example, the Education Center has been established for seventeen years, and it has been very difficult to raise a fund. The current expenses are limited, just enough to maintain the living expenses of the staff and students, which makes it impossible to accommodate the unfortunate children sent by all parties. The education authorities only allow the establishment of primary schools, not junior high schools. She had intended to raise the level of students and train talents, but this is limited by the school system. The students cannot develop their talents. Madam Huang had a few emotional words: "...I am not a capitalist, not an entrepreneur, nor an educator; this humble education undertaking relies entirely on social support. Otherwise, my heart is willing but my strength is weak, and everything will become a dream. However, as long as I live, I will fulfill my obligations for one day. No matter what difficulties I encounter, I will never shirk my responsibility."</p>
<h3>Madam Huang Keqiang</h3>
<p>Madam Huang spoke in great detail about the affairs of the Education Center, but my intention was to ask her opinions on women's issues, so I changed the subject and asked another question: "Madam, what kind of work do you think Chinese women should be doing at present?"</p>
<p>She pondered for a moment and then said: "The best thing to do is practical basic work - education. What education needs is special education, such as education for orphans, the poor, the weak, the disabled, the blind, and the mute, which has always been neglected by people. Our women comrades should make every effort to promote it and seek some benefits for the unfortunate children. As for being a good wife and mother at home, this is an inherent duty, without any doubt."</p>
<p>"Women also face many difficulties in serving society. What are your insights on this, Madam?"</p>
<p>"Because of physiological reasons, women certainly cannot be compared with men. Most women find the responsibility of managing the household already heavy, let alone taking care of external affairs. However, some women with superior abilities should each use their abilities and strengths, and do their best to serve society according to their individual preferences. I believe that the results obtained will be many times better than in the family. However, the age at which women serve is less than that of men. After a woman reaches the age of fifty, her spirit declines, so men have a greater responsibility for social undertakings, and their achievements are also superior. These are all natural phenomena. In such occasions, men should not despise women, but should take a cooperative attitude of mutual support."</p>
<p>Madam Huang is nearly sixty years old, but her complexion is rosy and she seems very strong. I asked about Madam's daily life and entertainment methods.</p>
<p>Madam does not admit that she has a healthy body, and that she is of an extremely weak disposition. She said, "I used to be very strong, but after the death of Mr. Keqiang, I suffered extreme stimulation; in the fourth year of the Republic of China, Japan forced me to recognize the Twenty-One Demands, which deepened the pain; the September 18th Incident in the Northeast further affected my nerves, resulting in insomnia and blood pressure above 200 degrees. I know that I am extremely weak, and cannot bear heavy burdens. My life is extremely simple. I do not go out for social events, nor do I go to entertainment venues. My entertainment is watching flowers and planting bamboo, and chatting and laughing with the unfortunate children every day." At this point, I took a photo of Madam and bowed and retreated. I heard the sound of reading aloud, and the unfortunate children were diligently studying without stopping, which suddenly stirred my heart to relieve suffering and help the poor!</p>

<h3>Finance: Interest Rates on Interbank Loans Remain Unchanged During the Bank Closure Period</h3>
<p>The Spread on Guangjiao Coin Further Shrinks by 3%</p>
<p>Yesterday was Easter (i.e., the foreign Qingming Festival). All Chinese and foreign banks and foreign firms were closed. There are a total of 11, 12, 13, and 14 days. All banks will reopen on the 14th. However, during this bank closure period, the financial market was calm, which goes without saying. The interbank lending rates for both Chinese and foreign banks in the market remained at 8% in the morning and afternoon. The trading volume of interbank loans was more than 2.7 million in the morning, more than 300,000 in new transactions, and more than 300,000 in the afternoon. The trading volume in the small general meeting was more than 500,000, and the long-term maturity settlement was more than 500,000. However, the amount requested for transfer reached more than 400,000, so the settlement was less than 100,000. Money shops received more than 44 million in foreign public notes, and the collection of foreign head loans and banks was completely stopped. In the auxiliary coin market, the unofficial market price of Guangdong small foreign coins weakened by another 3%, to 11.95 jiao. Only 15,000 jiao were traded in the morning, and there were no transactions in the afternoon. Copper coins remained unchanged at 302,000. The transaction price was 2,400 yuan in legal tender, equivalent to 7,200 strings of copper coins.</p>
<h3>Suspected Shipments of More Than 200,000 Tea Cocoons Yesterday</h3>
<p>The two uses of tea cocoons were not very popular in previous years. This year, due to the unwillingness of silver and money businesses to lend, the situation is very bleak. Few people on the market are talking about it, and the news is quite quiet. According to inquiries from people in the two industries yesterday morning, the funds for tea were less than in previous years because the output from the producing areas was lower than in previous years, and tea merchants went to collect less than last year. Large companies shipped 70,000 to 80,000 to Qinyang yesterday, and 10,000 to 20,000 in auxiliary coins. As for the two businesses, there were more than a dozen apartments shipping to Jiaxing and Anhui yesterday, but because the weather was cold, the development of silkworms was relatively slow, and it was still far from the cocoon season.</p>
<h3>Food: Rice Prices in Hexia Rise by Several Cents</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were only more than 20 sources from various gangs, with nearly 5,000 dan of goods. People's confidence is still high, and sales in this street have moved slightly. Sellers immediately raised prices, so the price of thick early japonica rice continued to increase by several cents to nearly one jiao. However, it was heard that the sale of thin rice in bags was suspended due to the Lunar New Year closure, and only one load was sold. Therefore, the market color was flat. Du Yang's pointed red rice was sold, and Yin Aiyuan's rice remained unchanged.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 24-25 companies from Hexia Road continued to sell japonica rice in bags, and the market price increased by several cents to one jiao. However, the trend of sales on the return trip weakened slightly at the close. Early rice followed up by one jiao. Thin rice changed for the better, and the price rose sharply by several cents. Yang Du and Bu Ke Xian's retail sales were still acceptable, and the market situation was tight. The retail sales of Bian Yuan and Yin Yuan were normal, and the price was also stable. The prices of other goods were fixed.</p>

Soybeans rose by more than one jiao, with 15 cars of Changchun beans, 3 cars of Tongliao beans, 7 cars of Sipingjie beans, 5 cars of large beans from the fork road, and more than 200 bags of Zhumadian beans traded.</p>
<h3>Sudden Large Purchases of American Wheat</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Flour and Wheat Exchange was closed due to the foreign Qingming Festival, so there were no market quotations. There was sporadic light rain in the dry areas of American wheat, which disappointed the factory market. There must be solid bullish factors to attract large purchases.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: The Price of Local Fine White Sugar in the Lower Grades Drops</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable, but transactions were still few.

Domestic sugar such as Diao Qing was 9.5 yuan, and Zhi Zhong was 12.7 jiao. There were transactions for both, but the number was less than 200 bags.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the bid-opening date for the Sugar Industry Cooperative, with a total quota of 5,257 bags. Due to the bank holiday, trading was slow. Only 100 bags of Wuyang coarse white sugar produced by the Shunde factory were traded at 21.85 yuan.

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was calm and unremarkable, and the price remained largely unchanged. The spot price fell by one pound, and the futures price fell by one or two pounds. The spot price of British cotton rose by three points, and the futures price fell by one point. Indian cotton was initially weak due to spot merchants selling and bulls closing out their positions, but later rose due to European exporters cross-buying. The price of Pingguo rose by two rupees, the price of Aomula rose by half a rupee, and the price of Bailuoxi rose by 0.25 rupees. The original telegram is on the left (telegram dated the 9th).</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (the 9th) the New York stock market rose and fell unevenly. Railroad stocks suddenly rose sharply, and the entire market was supported by them. The rising trend of the Erie Railroad was very sharp, because the road's profits were showing signs of increasing. Steel stocks initially fell due to bulls taking profits, and the market was quite depressed, but later rebounded under the leadership of Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Company. Many stocks showed signs of weakness because bulls took profits due to the lack of a market the following day. Stocks on the small exchange market were slightly lower and lacked vitality. The bond market was mixed and slightly lower. The total daily turnover was 1.65 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Ordinary Hailin Serge is Sold at a Discount</h3>
<p>Although Hailin serge has a wide daily sales volume, it is inferior to that of the past, because most customers are tired of it, so the sales of medium and thick serge have become popular again. Fortunately, the arrival of Hailin serge this spring is also rare, so it can maintain its original state. However, the ordinary goods of more than four yuan have to be discounted accordingly because the Yihe goods woven in Shanghai are only sold for 3.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Tea Industry in Hunan and Hubei Suddenly Booms</h3>

<h3>Miscellaneous News: Rising Prices of Raw Peanuts Continue to Intensify</h3>

According to yesterday's market situation, the price has fallen by 1-2 yuan. The listed price was once 52-53 yuan per picul. The market may have to loosen prices in the future, but there is not much in stock, so there is no fear of a large drop.</p>
<h3>Research on Anhui Tea (3)</h3>
<p>— Shi Jifa</p>
<p>Production</p>
<p>The tea produced in Anhui Province accounts for nearly two-thirds of the total output in the country. There are no accurate statistics on its production. For those sold overseas, there are still export statistics from the customs. For those sold domestically, it is even more difficult to obtain precise statistics. According to the third resolution of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, the annual output of Anhui is 201,099 dan, of which green tea accounts for the majority, with 153,448 dan. Black tea is produced in Qimen, with 38,594 dan, and tea buds are 318 dan.</p>
<p>According to a survey in the fourth year of the Republic of China, the area of tea gardens in Anhui was 750.19 mu, and the harvest volume was 47,928,788 jin.

<h3>Method for Radically Curing Stomach Pain</h3>
<p>— Wang Shiying</p>
<p>The sources of stomach pain are diverse. Incomplete use of medicine makes it difficult to cure radically. For those caused by excessive stomach acid, the priority is to neutralize the acid. For those caused by stomach inflammation and swelling, the priority is to remove the inflammation. For those caused by stomach wall erosion, the priority is to protect the membrane. For those caused by stomach muscle cramps, the priority is to relieve the spasms. Other causes, such as pyloric obstruction and nerve irritation, can also cause pain. Dissolving stagnation and calming the nerves are also essential. If stomach medicine is used comprehensively, the root of the disease can be easily eliminated. However, for stomachs that have been weakened by long-term illness, recovery is difficult to achieve without nourishing and strengthening them. Therefore, radical cure is not possible. Therefore, I have accumulated experience in treating long-term, difficult, and stubborn stomach pain and stomach disorders, which I will describe below for reference.</p>
<p>The patient, Zhang Xingzhai, is from Dinghai and is 41 years old. He has suffered from stomach pain for many years and has been delayed in treatment. Last winter, he was introduced to me by his close friend, Mr. Zhu Junchuan. I instructed him to purchase the famous stomach medicine "Weitong Ling" from the Sino-French Pharmacy to treat his stomach pain and eliminate the root of the disease. He also took "Jianwei Su" to nourish his stomach. The pain was eliminated, and he recovered his strength. He and Mr. Zhu Junchuan achieved the same satisfactory results.</p>
<h3>Saving the Weak by Quitting Smoking and Breaking Addiction</h3>
<p>— Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>Opium initially seems to have the effect of invigorating the spirit and relieving pain. However, long-term use will lead to numbness and mental depression. By the time one becomes addicted, hundreds of symptoms of weakness will appear. From then on, one is branded in the black book, and it is difficult to quit. Rescue is impossible.</p>
<p>However, quitting smoking is not difficult. If a medicine to save the weak is used, the spirit will be refreshed and the body will be strengthened. Furthermore, if a medicine to eliminate toxins and break addiction is taken, the toxins will be eliminated and the sight of smoke will be disliked. With safe conditioning, great success will be achieved.</p>
<p>Mr. Ru Baoji, who lives in Lannidu, Pudong, was addicted to opium for twelve years. He repeatedly tried to quit, but stopped because he was weak and suffered from various illnesses. Last autumn, he was introduced to me by his neighbor, Mr. Lu, to quit. I diagnosed that Mr. Ru not only suffered from various symptoms of neurasthenia, but also had joint pain and frequent nocturnal emissions. I immediately instructed him to purchase "Strong-Standen's Bone Pain Tablets" from the Sino-Western Pharmacy to treat his bone pain, and "Hemet's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to treat his nocturnal emissions. As for eliminating toxins, breaking addiction, and saving the weak, I mainly used the famous medicine "Reproductive Element." After taking it for a month, the illnesses were eliminated and he became strong and safely quit smoking. He was delighted and thanked me.</p>
<h3>Women's Savior: Self-Treatment for Hidden Diseases</h3>
<p>(Letter from Madam Pan Huaichun) Every time I menstruate, I feel cold in my uterus and pain. Sometimes it comes early, sometimes it comes late, and sometimes it is as heavy as metrorrhagia, or as light as spotting. I am thin and weak, and I am tired and lack energy. In addition, I have persistent leukorrhea, which is difficult to tell. My body and mind are suffering and indescribable. Last autumn, I accidentally read this publication and saw that a certain lady also suffered from the same illness. She cured herself with the internal and external use of "Reproductive Element for Women" and "Leukorrhea Eliminator." I immediately went to the nearby Wuzhou Pharmacy to purchase them, and secretly treated myself according to the instructions. The leukorrhea was cleared first, and my menstruation was adjusted. The chronic illness was cured, and I regained my health. Moreover, my breasts developed and I regained the beauty of my honeymoon. These two medicines are truly the saviors of our women!</p>
<h3>Three Yin Malaria Wine</h3>
<p>— Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Can be purchased from pharmacies. If entrusted to this publication to handle, the cost is one yuan per dose.</p>
<p>Tinct Quinine 3 liang Tinct Gention Co 1 liang Tinct Quassia 1 liang (Dosage) Half a wine glass per dose, three times a day.</p>
<h3>Treatment for Joint Pain</h3>
<p>— Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Joint pain is caused by wind-dampness accumulating inside, or by uncleared toxins from previous illnesses. The treatment should take into account the removal of wind-dampness and the search for residual toxins. Otherwise, it is not easy to cure radically. Once prolonged, it will lead to muscle cramps, numbness of the limbs, and even hemiplegia, forming paralysis.</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng Yuting came to see me last winter, complaining of numbness in his limbs. Whenever it was a festival or the weather was gloomy, his joints and muscles were sore and unbearable. He had taken □□□, but it was not fully effective. I instructed him to purchase "Strong-Standen's Bone Pain Tablets" from the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company. Because this product takes into account wind-dampness and residual toxins, his joints and muscles felt comfortable after taking it, and his limbs became flexible. He said that he had suffered from this chronic illness for several years, and now he has finally recovered, as if he had ascended to heaven again.</p>
<h3>Saved from Nocturnal Emission and Premature Ejaculation</h3>
<p>(Letter from Mr. M.K. Dzen) When I was fourteen years old, I was seduced by bad friends and mistakenly committed masturbation. I realized that my body was gradually weakening, so I woke up and quit. However, I had already contracted nocturnal emission. (Omitted) At the age of nineteen, I got married at my parents' orders. I suffered from premature ejaculation even more. My vitality was lost, and I failed my wife's expectations. My body and mind were in pain, and I was even weaker. Last autumn, I sent a letter to the Q&amp;A column of this publication and was introduced to Dr. Zhan Nianceng, a venereal disease expert, for treatment. I received painless electrotherapy. I was instructed to purchase "Hemet's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" from the Taihe Pharmacy to treat my nocturnal emission, and "Reproductive Element" to treat my premature ejaculation. The effects were significant after taking them. The nocturnal emission was treated first and foremost. Now my body is strong, my muscles are developed, my blood is strong, and my spirit is refreshed. I remember his merits and should not conceal them. I have recorded the beginning and end of the matter to express my gratitude and to make an introduction.</p>

<h3>Case Records of Venereal Disease Treatment</h3>

<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road</p>
<p>(1) Premature Ejaculation and Kidney Impotence Cured</p>
<p>Youthful venereal disease, restoring vitality.</p>
<p>Patient Chen Zhengluan, 23 years old, from Zhejiang, in school. (Chief complaint)——Premature ejaculation. Semen discharge at the sight of women. Kidney impotence. Loss of vitality. (Medical history)——Mr. Chen was poisoned by erotic books in his youth and mistakenly committed masturbation. He relied on his strength and did not cherish it, resulting in the destruction of his vitality. He suffered from premature ejaculation and kidney impotence after marriage last year, making it difficult to fulfill his marital duties. His life was boring. He began to seek treatment at my clinic last autumn. (Treatment)——In addition to performing the latest scientific surgery, painless electrotherapy, I believe that the root of Mr. Chen's illness lies in the atrophy of the reproductive glands. Other medicines could not be effective. I instructed him to purchase "Reproductive Element" from the Sino-Western Pharmacy. Electricity and medicine were used together, and his vitality was restored. The chronic venereal disease was completely eliminated. His body developed, and he was like a different person.</p>
<p>(2) Dysmenorrhea, Leukorrhea, Quitting Smoking, and Breaking Addiction</p>
<p>Women's hidden diseases, an example of quitting smoking.</p>
<p>Patient Madam Zhuang Ruiping, 37 years old, local. (Chief complaint)——Abdominal pain during menstruation, cervicitis, leukorrhea, pain from quitting smoking, loss of health, and infertility. (Medical history)——Madam Zhuang comes from a wealthy family. She contracted an opium addiction while accompanying her grandmother to smoke before she got married. It was difficult to quit. After marriage, due to physical weakness, she suffered from the above-mentioned symptoms. She has been married for sixteen years and has had no children. Recently, due to the government's strict ban on smoking, she suffered indescribable pain and asked her relative to introduce her to see a doctor. (Treatment)——I instructed her to purchase "Reproductive Element for Women" for internal use and "Leukorrhea Eliminator" for external use from the Huamei Pharmacy. She felt that her body was strong and her uterus was healthy. Her menstruation was regulated and her leukorrhea was cleared. Because "Reproductive Element for Women" has the effect of eliminating toxins and breaking addiction, she safely quit smoking. In early winter, Mr. Zhuang came to my clinic on business and learned that she was pregnant with a son.</p>

<p>Patient: Zhang Shengshou, 28 years old, Shaoxing, in business. (Chief Complaint) -- Excessive stomach acid, regurgitation, vomiting, nocturnal emission, insomnia, brain deficiency, weak body. (Medical History) -- Mr. Zhang was ignorant of health preservation when he was young. Not only was his diet irregular, but he also mistakenly indulged in bad habits, leading to nocturnal emission, stomach pain, and other symptoms. He suffered from insomnia, forgetfulness, weak stomach, and a feeble body, causing him great distress. It was not until early winter that he was introduced to my clinic by his colleague, Mr. Feng. (Treatment) -- In addition to prescribing "Stomach Pain Relieving Elixir" to treat his stomach pain and "Stomach Strengthening Tablets" to nourish his long-term weak stomach, I also instructed him to purchase and take "Hymethol's Essence Consolidating Pills" from the China-England Dispensary to treat his nocturnal emission, and "Shengzhisu" to nourish his deficiency. By addressing both the symptoms and the root cause, and combining treatment with nourishment, we achieved the most satisfactory results.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>"Comfort Bags" and Other Matters</h3>
<p>— Qian Nan</p>
<p>Two news dispatches in the newspapers of the 7th are quite noteworthy: The first dispatch says, "The puppet Harbin Municipal Government recently produced 50,000 'comfort bags' and forcibly extracted money from the public to comfort the Japanese and puppet troops fighting against the volunteer army. Although the public is extremely opposed to this, they only dare to be angry but dare not speak out under the heavy oppression of the Japanese and puppet regimes. ... Once everything is completed, Zhang Jinghui, Yu Zhishan, and others will select dozens of beautiful wives and daughters as resolute traitors and forcibly select more than a hundred beauties from the people to be sent to various places to comfort the Japanese and puppet troops," and the second dispatch says, "The various units under the puppet First Military District have suffered heavy casualties due to repeated attacks by the volunteer army. In order to strengthen their ranks to cope with the volunteer army's anti-Soviet and anti-Mongolian operations, in addition to the first batch of 376 recruits who have already been distributed, they are still actively recruiting. However, because many young people in the Northeast are aware that they would rather join the volunteer army and shed blood on the battlefield than be puppets and run errands for the enemy, the recruitment results are extremely limited."</p>
<p>Reading the above two dispatches together, we can discover the personalities of two different types of people amidst the intensifying national crisis with a formidable enemy at our borders. One type is the traitors, who have no other skills except for exploiting the people and fawning on their masters. Before September 18th, what kind of people were Zhang Jinghui, Yu Zhishan, and their ilk in the eyes of the public? If we are not forgetful, we should not have forgotten their corruption and other inferior deeds. As soon as a formidable enemy approaches the border, these spineless lackeys immediately flatter the new masters when they see the new masters' aggressive advance. As for the masters, they are unfamiliar with the territory and naturally need henchmen to deal with and suppress the "bandits," who could become volunteer soldiers at any time. Now that they have come knocking on their door, there is nothing more to be said.</p>
<p>Since these spineless lackeys have changed masters, they naturally have to work hard to win the new masters' favor, and all they can do is exploit the people, which is their specialty, making "comfort bags" and "forcibly selecting women" are only a fraction of their duties. Flattery and being a lackey are inseparable.</p>
<p>In stark contrast to the "traitors" are the "awakened" youth. Although they are under "heavy oppression," they will never kowtow and beg for mercy, nor will they reduce their patriotic enthusiasm. On the contrary, through bloody experience, they have more clearly recognized the enemy and their henchmen's sinister tricks. It is only natural that the recruitment of puppet troops has "extremely limited success."</p>
<p>The enemy's intensified aggression, the shameless traitors' surrender, and the "selling party's" obsequiousness are not to be feared. What is to be feared is whether the enthusiasm of the patriotic youth will wane with the passage of time and the intensification of oppression, and whether we will shrink back because of incomplete "awakening"!</p>
<p>The survival of the Chinese nation will be determined by the degree of "awakening" of patriotic youth.</p>
<h3>Pier</h3>
<p>— Bai Ling</p>
<p>One of Qingdao Sketches</p>
<p>The June dusk. The setting sun softly loves the vast sea. The tranquil sea breeze gently blows on the water, carrying laughter like a maiden's silver bell. A curved mountain range lies quietly in the middle of the seabed. The verdant forests are filled with the loud chirping songs of returning birds. Gulls, in flocks, flutter erratically over the sea. Slowly, slowly, they fly far away.</p>
<p>Beyond the back of the mountain, a plume of inky black smoke rises, curling upward. Gradually, gradually, the curved mountain range is submerged in the haze of smoke.</p>
<p>The sea seems to be restless. A huge warship roars with a loud whistle, gliding straight past the foot of the mountain and rushing towards the Jiaohai Customs pier.</p>
<p>Therefore, a pile of panting human shadows busies itself on the pier. There is the laughter of daughters from the South, who specialize in welcoming seaborne wanderers, the groaning cries of coolies, the shouts of hawkers, and the pitiful pleas of beggar women kneeling by the roadside with children in their arms. These, these break the stillness of dusk.</p>
<p>A heavy object after another is unloaded from the ship that has just entered the port, now piled up on the shore. Standing next to the pile is a tall sailor with a crooked nose, gesturing to a group of coolies. Within a few minutes, human shadows have surrounded the pile of objects and the sailor. They are all arguing about wanting to carry, some carrying one piece with two people, some even cursing each other. Thus, the sailor really doesn't have the energy to take care of so many individual hands. So, he shouts angrily, raising his fists and kicking his feet. A coolie is injured. He clutches a bleeding leg with both hands, collapsing painfully on the ground. In the cries of the people, a ten-year-old girl, carrying a basket of coal kernels in her hand, runs quickly towards the injured man. This man is her father. The girl touches her father's bleeding wound with both hands, her hands stained with a mass of blood, oh, as if her heart is also stained with a mass of blood! Crying, she looks up at the sailor standing motionlessly and blankly next to her, and she lowers her head sadly, sobbing with a sad face: "Dad, you really are, why are you so careless..." While crying, she takes off the tattered bamboo-green little undershirt she is wearing and firmly wraps it around her father's wound. Her father opens his eyes, grabs her withered and dirty little hand, his lips trembling, unable to speak. He cries.</p>
<p>At this time, a policeman standing nearby comes over, he drives away the crowd gathering around. He also raises his hand and salutes the sailor, smiling. The sailor mumbles a lot to the policeman, but the policeman can only listen blankly, nodding. After a long while, the sailor takes out a five-yuan bill from his waist and hands it to the policeman, meaning that he should give it to the little girl. The policeman takes the money and immediately approaches the little girl, asking: "What's your name?"</p>
<p>"Xiaozhen."</p>
<p>"Where do you live?"</p>
<p>"It's very far, in Xidasen."</p>
<p>"Who is in your family?"</p>
<p>"There's my mom, and a little brother. Mom has been sick for three months. Dad works as a coolie, I pick up coal kernels. Dad was kicked and injured, he can't work anymore. Mom is also sick, what are we going to eat?" Crying, crying, she rubs her eyes with her hands.</p>
<p>The policeman is stunned for a long time, then he murmurs: "Send your dad home, he's giving you five yuan, you go home and give it to your mom."</p>
<p>A rickshaw pulls an injured ghost, running along the brightly lit streets. Xiaozhen follows behind the rickshaw, wiping her tears, clutching a five-yuan bill tightly in her hot hands, oh, her naive heart is shattered!</p>
<h3>Public Display</h3>
<p>— Meng Hua</p>
<p>After the last long-distance bus left, the town seemed even more desolate. The small shops were all boarded up, only the Changxiang Hotel was still open. Two people who hadn't finished drinking were talking there, the light of the kerosene lamp on the counter shining out of the shop door, spilling horizontally on the stone slab road.</p>
<p>The wind carried a light rain across the center of the street, and when the wind passed, the locust trees by the side of the road shook off many drops of water, falling into the puddles in the center of the street, splashing up a burst of tiny water flowers, many bubbles reflecting the light, like water droplets on lotus leaves.</p>
<p>In the distance came a low bark, which seemed particularly heavy in the rain.</p>
<p>In the shop, Leprosy Head put down his wine glass, coughed, wiped his nose with his thumb, then squeezed his shoulders tightly and said to Wang Sheng:</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>"It's not really true, I saw it with my own eyes when I went to the city this morning."</p>
<p>Then they both fell silent again. At this moment, the shopkeeper flipped his abacus and stood up, asking Leprosy Head:</p>
<p>"Head, have you heard about Jin Xiang's matter?"</p>
<p>"What people are saying is correct! I saw it with my own eyes. They chopped off his head and put it on top of a pile of lime, the purple blood seeping onto it..." He seemed unable to continue speaking, but then said: "There were really many people watching, there were four old generals standing by watching, alas!"</p>
<p>"A person like Jin Xiang, hey, would dogs even bite him?" said the shopkeeper.</p>
<p>Leprosy Head sank into memory: He felt that the skinny guy who liked to make faces seemed to appear before his eyes. He remembered that three days before the incident, he had gone to the city with him to buy Bu Nei Men fertilizer, but nine days ago, he suddenly disappeared. It wasn't until the day before yesterday that he learned that he had committed a crime and been caught. Today, the city had chopped off his head and put it on public display in the center of the street. All of this really felt too fast and too mysterious to him. He scratched the back of his head with a haunted look (the hair there was like newly planted rice seedlings, sparse and scattered without many strands) and said to Wang Sheng:</p>
<p>"Brother Sheng, can you lend me a hundred cash to use? Asking me to collect his body, not to mention I can't afford it, the masters in the government will definitely not agree. I just want to burn a few pounds of paper money, to give him some money to spend. What do you think,..." said Leprosy Head.</p>
<p>Footsteps came slowly from far away. A man wearing a straw raincoat walked in, he shook the raindrops off his raincoat, causing the lamplight to flicker constantly.</p>
<p>"Shopkeeper, half a pound of wine."</p>
<p>The man's face was very gray, and wearing that straw raincoat, he looked like a hedgehog from afar. He sat down abruptly, shaking his head constantly.</p>
<p>"Tsk, tsk, tsk, Jin Xiang's situation, injustice, injustice!"</p>
<p>He took the wine cup and poured out the wine. Suddenly, he froze again. He stood up, pressing both hands on the table, propping himself up. He slammed his palm hard on the table, overturning the wine. The wine flowed down from the edge of the table, dripping on Wang Sheng's cloth shoes.</p>
<p>"Jin Xiang, such a person!" Wang Sheng said softly.</p>
<p>Leprosy Head stared blankly at the street, the rain still falling incessantly. A woman's voice was shouting on the road: "San's Dad, are you dead? It's raining so hard, do you want to die outside? Jin Xiang took you away!"</p>
<p>Leprosy Head shuddered. He pleaded softly to Wang Sheng:</p>
<p>"Brother Sheng, I want to burn some silver cash for Jin Xiang, can you lend me two hundred cash?"</p>
<p>"Where are you going to burn it for him?"</p>
<p>"I want to go to the South School Ground, they said he was killed there," he said. "Is there anyone who has been better to him? I'm not related to him, but..." Leprosy Head choked, two huge teardrops dripping from the corners of his eyes.</p>
<p>"Jin Xiang, alas, he was wronged, this honest man," the shopkeeper said with emotion. "Head, if you go to the city to burn paper ingots tomorrow, I'll entrust you with five hundred, remember!"</p>
<p>The wind blew into the shop with moisture, and the lamplight flickered constantly. From afar came bursts of barking, as low as ghosts weeping.</p>
<h3>The Bread Seller</h3>
<p>— Li Ang</p>
<p>I don't know his name, nor do I know his background. Every two days, morning and evening, he always brings his gray face, gray lips, panting, to our school gate, sliding his heavy load off his shoulder, sitting on the boundary stone along the street, leaning his body against the wall, letting the air stuck in his throat slowly calm down, and then, he greets every familiar customer. He is the bread seller.</p>
<p>There are also some noble classmates who don't like to eat his bread, complaining that his bread has no cream, no coarse-grained raisins, no superior fruit jam, and their delicate stomachs are not used to accommodating this withered food. Some people have also asked him: "Hey, bread seller, you're really stupid, can't you peddle some exquisite bread? It's always this hard and rough stuff..." In fact, he is not stupid at all, his</p>
<p>answer is: "It's really what the gentlemen said, who in business doesn't hope to have a wide variety of goods that suit the customers' tastes, so they can earn more money," ... Speaking of this, he always has to catch that breath.</p>
<p>... Then he sighed: "Alas, alas ... I don't have that much capital, what can I do?"</p>
<p>Every time I do business with him, I always see him forcing a smile with depression; "Sir, today's bread is not small, right? There are also many rock sugar crumbs, haha..." Several times, I also answered him in a wordless way: "It's a pity it always has some sour and astringent taste." He looked very uneasy when he heard it. "Is it really sour? But I don't know, I've never tasted my own bread, not even the crumbs are sold to people for fried pork chops, sir, I have to negotiate with the wholesale shop owner..." He gasped again, so I deeply regretted that I shouldn't have stirred up his unease. He is the person who serves my food, he delivers bread for people every day, but he doesn't even get to taste the crumbs himself, this should be the uneasiness of the enjoyers, but many customers don't give any sympathy.</p>
<p>One day, after leaving class, I rushed to the school gate, but I didn't see the bread seller and his load. On the street, by the boundary stone, there were a few drops of bloodstains and some bread crumbs. According to the gatekeeper, he was arrested by the patrolman because he didn't have a stall license. At first, he refused to leave, so he was grabbed a few times, blood pouring from his nose, holding his nostrils he was taken away... Listening, my own nostrils also felt sore.</p>
<p>That morning, I didn't eat anything. At lunchtime, seeing that the fish pieces still had purple blood streaks, I remembered the bread seller again, the bloodstains on the street and the boundary stone seemed to reappear before my eyes, I almost didn't have the courage to eat that bowl of fish. Hehe, the fish pieces in the bowl, the people who are swept into the torrent of life... How can I tell? All the way to reading the lyrics, caressing the bread vendor who was trampled by life.</p>
<p>For three or four days in a row, I didn't see him. I guessed he was injured by the pot, and I guessed he might have died from his injuries. The noble classmates said: "It doesn't matter if he doesn't come, his bread is always that rough and tasteless." But, he was found at the school gate again early this morning, but he has a grayer face and lips, still sitting on that stone, still panting? Greeting every customer: "Sir, today's bread is not small, right? There are also many rock sugar crumbs, haha..." He still greets me with a smile, saying to me; "From next month, I'm going to give this bread load to my son, my sick body can't withstand the wind and waves."</p>
<p>When I can't think of words to perfunctorily, I chew a mouthful of bread, it still has a sour and astringent taste ...</p>
<h3>Shenzhen by Night</h3>
<p>— Ye Lai</p>
<p>——Travel Notes</p>
<p>At dusk, the tranquil Kowloon is draped in a layer of gauze-like sunset clouds. The sea breeze drifting from the sea is so gentle, assailing the heart of the traveler. The sky unfolds a gradually darkening sunset, and southerners are exactly the types who seek stimulation.</p>
<p>"Go to Shenzhen, it will give you many new feelings."</p>
<p>Another new friend, Miss Lili patted my arm like a child, my heart was very happy, I was willing to look for new shadows, to explore the dark corners within the spheres of influence of imperialism in that charming place, perhaps I was hoping that the misery of the colonized people would unfold completely before my eyes.</p>
<p>Following Lili to that huge railway station, I could already see the Hong Kong waters across the sea, reflecting the neon lights, gently rippling. It was completely lost in the lights, and the unfolding smoke made it even more blurred.</p>
<p>The people coming and going in the railway station seemed so lively. In a moment, the long line of trains took us away from that noisy marketplace-like place and began to rush into the smoke. In the carriage, most of those seen were the airs of young masters and young ladies. Men and women, dreaming smiling faces, reflected from under the dim yellow light. Looking out from the carriage, the distant mountain peaks were lost in the sunset, running along. The weeds on the plains, the homesteads and small buildings on the plains, made people feel that this place was infected with the rustic flavor of the West.</p>
<p>Rumbling, rumbling, this accustomed train tune, advancing like a roaring lion, stirring the traveler's heart, hastily, as if telling me that I would soon arrive at that charming place, where I could clearly see the demons of humanity.</p>
<p>The train passed through three mountain tunnels, at which time I could feel the suffocating and foul-smelling breath. The darkness was as if the train had taken us to hell. What a terrible place it was! However, after passing through these tunnels, which are the most magnificent casinos and dog racing tracks in South China, Shenzhen appeared on the plain, wearing beautiful clothes.</p>
<p>The train stopped, and people marched like fish into the winding bridges. There were many people stopped at the station, mostly luxurious figures, girls, completely covered with the color of aristocratic society. When I stepped into such a place, I involuntarily became constrained. However, on that winding wooden bridge, one could look into the inside of Shenzhen, which was full of dazzling lights, like a fairy country in mythology, the singing emanating from it, resounding and floating. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Fallen Mountain Tiger</h3>
<p>— Lin Danqiu</p>
<p>Every year, when Qingming Festival is approaching, my mother would always send me a letter, and she would always mention the ancestral grave of "Fallen Mountain Tiger."</p>
<p>"...Qingming is approaching again. After receiving the letter, you should set off for home immediately to pay respects at the tomb of your great-grandfather at 'Fallen Mountain Tiger'. After Qingming, you can go back to Shanghai..."</p>
<p>Thus, as usual, I would be reminded of the story about "Fallen Mountain Tiger."</p>
<p>"Fallen Mountain Tiger" is a mountain that looks exactly like a tiger descending the mountain. It is the most famous burial ground in the whole village. Because of it, my kind-hearted father, who always advocated "better safe than sorry," actually fought a lawsuit with others for several years, losing most of his family fortune. However, my father didn't regret it at all at the time, because the burial ground was finally judged in his favor, and the tomb was built peacefully. According to the Feng Shui master, this tomb was bound to bring great fortune, and it would start from my generation. So, all the men, women, old, and young in the village believed that I would grow up to be a very wealthy man.</p>
<p>I was only six years old that year. The following year, I entered the village's primary school and achieved particularly good grades, which was like pouring a pot of boiling oil on the fire of people's hopes for me. Everyone praised the Feng Shui master for his uncanny predictions.</p>
<p>My father was a former Qing dynasty Xiucai (passed the county level imperial exam), and also a graduate of a Western-style school run by the Qing government at the end of the dynasty. He considered himself very knowledgeable in worldly affairs. When the local Xiucai and scholars unanimously advocated that I should study more Confucian classics to lay a solid foundation for learning to restore the old order, my father strongly disagreed and wanted me to learn English early. He said that the richest people nowadays are the foreign officials in the Customs and Postal Service, and to become a foreign official, one must be proficient in English. So, in the spring of the third year, I was sent to the Jesus Church Elementary School in the city to study English.</p>
<p>From elementary school to middle school, from middle school to university, I didn't let my father down. I paid special attention to English, spending at least half of my time on it, but not for the purpose of becoming a foreign official as my father hoped, but because of my own special interest in English. During the holidays, when I returned home, my father would ask me what this thing was called in English, what that thing was called in English, and when I answered without hesitation, he would always grin, as if saying, "Indeed. Feng Shui really has its effects."</p>
<p>During my schooling, for some reason, the family's finances became tighter year by year. Every time I saw my father's worried and distressed look when raising tuition fees, I always wanted to ask him to allow me to drop out of school and find a job myself, but I never said it in the end, probably because I was afraid that my father would really agree?</p>
<p>But there was one time when I finally couldn't bear it anymore.</p>
<p>On the eve of my departure, ten yuan was still owed for tuition. My father asked someone to run from one house to another, probably visiting all the wealthy families who might lend money, but the person returned empty-handed, telling my father that they wouldn't lend without land as collateral.</p>
<p>"What? Don't I even have ten yuan worth of credit?" My father's eyes turned red, and he was about to cry.</p>
<p>"Dad, I don't want to study anymore. I want to find a job." I was also about to cry.</p>
<p>My father raised his eyebrows and said angrily:</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>"What do you want? If we have to sell land, we'll sell land. Rice poured into a wine vat won't be wasted!..."</p>
<p>Now, the fact has proven that my father's rice was not poured into a wine vat, but into a sewage pool. Without meat, it wouldn't turn into fragrant wine, and others would secretly scold him for "wasting the gifts of nature."</p>
<p>Therefore, my father hadn't sent me a letter for several years. My mother was not as knowledgeable in worldly affairs as my father. Her hope for me, no, her hope for "Fallen Mountain Tiger," seemed not to have been completely extinguished. The proof is that every year when Qingming Festival is approaching, she always sends me a letter.</p>
<p>However, I didn't have to cut off my poor old mother's last glimmer of hope, so I routinely wrote her a reply full of hope.</p>
<p>"...I should have followed your instructions and returned home immediately to sweep the tomb, but because I am currently seeking a lucrative position, and there is a good chance of success, it is impossible for me to leave Shanghai for the time being..."</p>

<h3>April Drama News</h3>
<p>China Touring Group Coming to Shanghai Soon Two Anti-Imperialist Dramas Stopped Informally Drama Research Institute Prepares for Weekly Drama Seating</p>
<p>The China Touring Drama Group, which has been rumored for a long time to come to Shanghai, was previously stranded in Tianjin due to the ice封 of Dagu Port. According to Mr. Tang Huaiqiu, the head of the group who came to Shanghai in advance, he received a telegram from the group in Tianjin yesterday, saying that all 30 members would depart on the Taikoo Company's "Hunan Wheel" on the 12th, and are expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 16th or 17th. The reason why the group decided to come south is because the scenery props and other parts for the drama are numerous. If they were to come south via the Jinpu Railway, the freight would be enormous. Therefore, they had to take the sea route, allowing the people of Shanghai to see them first. Mr. Tang has now rented Ouyang Yuqian's former residence to wait for the national personnel to arrive in Shanghai. After a short rest, they will perform in a large theater. It is said that their popular plays are three major dramas: "Camellia", "Thunderstorm", and "Meiluo Xiang".</p>
<p>The two anti-imperialist famous dramas "The First Flag of Europe" and "Roar, China", which were advertised to be performed at the Shanghai Theater this month, have now been stopped informally. This is due to the theater's situation. Performing in May seems inappropriate, so it has been changed to June. The amateur drama people are considering rehearsing other plays, while the Shanghai Drama and Film Research Institute is working hard to prepare for a weekly research drama seating, planning to hold two drama performances every week to promote the popularization of drama. It is said that the drama seating will be temporarily set up in a certain high-end theater in the city. Once the audience is widespread, they will find a way to build a formal theater. It is said that the weekly research drama seating will appear in two weeks, and the first performance will also be a famous drama that has not been performed in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Xinhua Company's Big Expansion</h3>
<p>Large Numbers of People Sign Contracts</p>
<p>Recently, the film industry has been filled with an atmosphere of big expansion of the Xinhua Film Company. It is said that Boss Zhang Shankun has to sign many contracts on his desk every day. In addition to Shi Dongshan and Yang Xiaozhong, Ma Xuwibang has also signed a contract with Xinhua. Actors such as Jin Shan and Gu Eryi have already signed, and Xu Manli and Gu Menghu have formally joined. In terms of technical talent, Zhang Yunqiao, the "Everything Man" and lighting master from the former Datong Company, has also been hired. This Shi Dongshan went to Suzhou to inspect the location of "Night of Joy" and went with Zhang Yunqiao.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many more contracts, although they have been signed, but have not yet reached the stage of publication. In fact, Xinhua Company has indeed expanded to an astonishing extent. In a time when film companies are all shouting about recession, and you are cutting salaries and I am laying off employees, this phenomenon is very valuable.</p>
<p>Before "Peach Blossom Spring Dream", directed by Yang Xiaozhong and starring Han Lan'gen, Liu Jiqun, Tong Yuejuan, and Xu Manli, is completed, "Night of Joy", directed by Shi Dongshan, will be shot next. At the same time, the script of the play to be directed by Ma Xuwibang has also been sent to Beijing for review.</p>
