<h3>對上海市醫院之屬望</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>本市衛生局奉令主辦之上海市醫院。籌備以來。殊稱積極。頃聞建築部分。已告完成。內部配置。正在着手進行。預計本年雙十節可以開慕。市衛生局管轄下之醫藥機關。原有上海醫院與傳染病院。增此新興組織。適成鼎足之勢。從此提携並進。開務濟物。其足以被惠病黎。寗直小補而已。在諸般市政設施中。斯舉允稱最適合市民實際之需求。吾人又烏得不攄滿腔之熱誠。以祝此宏猷之展布。</p>
<p>以上海地位之衝要。人姻之稠密。藥物療具仰給之利便。良醫專家診所之充斥。一切衛生情形。自較內地為優。顧在貧寒之家。亦殊覺造治之匪易。一遇病魔糾纏。常至逡巡莫投。蓋私家醫生。大都診費昂貴。而公立性質之醫院。人事方面又多未能適如人願。故一方有逸豫從容之醫生。一方有呼籲無門之病黎。社會固無事不顯示其矛盾性。而在上海。此現象為特著。</p>
<p>公共醫院之設置。原在謀普遍之救濟。顧以號稱三百萬人口之大都市。而略具規模之醫院。寥寥殆止十家。其不能盡廣施博愛之責任。固意中事。嘗見有大批攅眉蹙額之疾尩。徘徊呻吟於醫院之門左。問其所以趦起莫前之故。或則以就診逾時被擯。或則以掛號滿額落伍。甚至以診察科別之出入舛午。而空勞跋涉者。蓋在醫院有章則之規定。而常人對之每多不甚了了。身懷疾疢。已極痛楚。而又逢此意外頓挫。寗不更堪憫惜。且也此輩貧病之人。就令已預掛號之列。得入診察之室。而醫生能否肯為悉心之治療而不掉以輕心。護士能否肯予委婉之指導而不出以惡聲。猶屬疑問。凡此皆為一般公共醫院普通之現象。而亟有待於切實之改進。</p>
<p>竊謂公立醫院之主要條件。經濟方面固宜有適應之供給。器物方面固宜有充實之準備。而人事管理方面。尤應有稱情合理之配置．內外科當以通日應診為原則。醫生則不妨許其更番輪值。醫生服務當令以病理為對象。而萬勿以病人之身份相衡量。此外醫生之如何考勤。護土之如何訓練。胥為不可或少之步驟。甚願新硎初發之上海市醫院。能為一般公共醫院樹立一良好之矩範也。</p>

<p>農村生活叢談</p>
<h3>四川北碚西山坪開荒成功記</h3>
<p>— 潘學海</p>
<p>這裏巴縣北碚的溫泉，是到過四川的人差不多都去住過，洗過澡來的；在隔嘉陵江對岸的一條山嶺，呌做西山坪，順着山嶺再進去三十里，便是中國西部科舉院的西山坪第二農塲，道個農塲所以值得談談：因從前，簡直是「處女荒地」，也許是自古以來沒有人去開墾過；至少在目前是尋不出會經開墾過的痕迹來的。而今却變成一片汪洋的沃土，算是　本成功了。目不單是農塲本身有辦法，便是農塲周圍無法生活的農民所得的帮助也不少，竟從此不至啼饑號寒了。據民二十一年統計：中國可耕地面，只有百分之二十七，而已耕的只佔百分之七，其餘荒廢的，竟佔百分之二十。這是一個多末使人驚心的數字。所以這個開荒成功的西山坪實施的辦法，是值得介紹來做一個參考的：</p>
<p>起初認為沒辦法的</p>
<p>這個農塲本來面目，從速方看來，簡直是「童山濯港」。身入範圍，則所見遍山都是矮樹小竹，及蕨蒺草而已。用鋤頭挖去這些原始植物，則遍地都被竹根和樹根所盤結，無方尺以上空土。在起初力主開這大塊荒土的人，是盧爾勤先生，（盧作孚先生的老弟）先在這很少人居的荒廢高原上，花了二千多大銀元，新修了一座中國式的平房，有房間二十餘個，還附搭有些草房，房子雖修好了；但有許多人認為是沒辦法的。僅有最少數人以遍山有十分之八九是土壤，僅其餘之一二是岩石，「勞力神聚」，只須把道些原始植物挖去，將生土碎細，把農作物種子放下去，那一定是有生機有辦法的啊。</p>
<p>試種西瓜　證明成功</p>
<p>旣有許多人不贊成，當然沒人投資；所以先只由峽防局的官長和士兵，在有空人時，便上山去用兵工開墾。經過長時間後，竟開有七十畝出來，在前年已試種過西瓜一次，至去年便大種，先是，西瓜這個農產品，只在夔門，創閣外才生產，而四川是未有此物的：當事人以西山坪係高原，地土乾燥，宜種西瓜，所以在省外帶有許多西瓜種來，瓜名三白瓜者，則有平湖種，山東種，陵園種等。馬鈴瓜，則有新豐種，嘉興種，平湖種等。還有山東紅，南京紅，三花瓜，三異瓜，德州瓜，馬雷瓜，金蜜瓜等。其來源地計共有豫魯冀江浙等省市，且在德州請有一個專門種西瓜的工人來。因此，在去年所種西瓜，都有收獲，共賺有二千餘大銀元，至是，才證明該農塲開荒的初步成功。</p>
<p>包墾和肥　料的辦法</p>
<p>計去年只開墾有七十畝，至今年則共開墾有兩百餘畝來種西瓜。將來收穫後如都能出售，不感供過於求，則可保證賺七千元左右。至其開墾辦法，因在兵墾無人分派時，則改僱附近農民包墾，在矮樹和小竹較少的地方，則講定三個大銀元一畝。較多的地方，則為四個大銀元一畝。至挖出的樹根則用來燒木炭，粗枝做柴燒，較大樹幹則用來做木料，（很少）其餘細枝細草細竹等都燒灰來做啊灰肥」。簡直沒有廢物，上面算是「粗開」，以後還須細細整理，才可種農作物。至肥料問題，在農塲適中地點，新修有一大圓糞池，其後面為方水池，前面則為灰房，至肥料來源，今已養有大羊羣，請有一專門養羊的工人，還養有猪和牛，因此，肥料便不在山下買，免搬運，多化錢，且是一筆生產。</p>
<p>水利解決　不怕天旱</p>
<p>至該農塲最重要問題則為水利。因原係一個「坪」，較一般平原為高，倘遇著水災，則所有雨水，都從高就下，流入平原的河川去了。倘遇着天旱，則所有山上農作物，都無處躱避，都會乾死的。正為該農塲是這棧不怕水災而怕天旱的，所以水利有無辦法問題，便是該農塲的生死問題。於是該農塲乃順　天然水槽，在地形成凹塘處，為築一長堤，便成一堰塘。像這樣的堰塘，目前已築成三個了。再另闢有許多小溝渠到各地去。卽該農塲水利的淸渠網從此已挖築成功了。再，該農塲係坐西向東，後面還有更高的山；而所有水源便是從更高的山來的，故在後面還我得有一處更大的凹塘，有兩條水源來匯聚，而周圍都是山岩，只須將兩小缺口用泥石封固後，便是一長方形的大湖便成為一個總水庫。這總水庫倘修成，則不僅全農塲，便是全山農民，從此都不怕天旱，可得灌溉之利了。</p>
<p>使農民生活都進步</p>
<p>在去年夏天，因整個西山坪都遭了早災，僅該農塲早挖有堰塘，所以附近農民都沒有收穫時而獨該農塲仍有收穫。因此，農民便帮該農塲挑西瓜下山去和開荒，（見上述）收人便能糊口。復次，該農塲還請附近農民帮喂意大利鷄，起頭拿鷄去時，雖有一定價值，但並不要一個現錢，而意大利鷄每年所能下鷄蛋共有二百餘個，待下後，便逐决把鷄蛋都交到農塲去替代鷄之價格。價值定得並不贵，蛋價也和一般市價是一樣的。待還淸楚後，意大利鷄便為農民所有，以後所　鷄蛋，仍照市價賣給農塲，便成為農民一筆新的經常收人了。再，農民帮喂意大利鷄時，公鷄母鷄都可以：惟如飼養本地土鷄，則只許喂母鷄，不許喂公鷄，以預防鷄種的變壞。至該農塲買回這許多鷄蛋後，再行孵化，照上述辦法逐漸推廣。此外，請農民帮喂波支猪，隆昌猪，北方綿羊等，辦法都大同小異，要在發展附近農家副業，使其生活漸有改進。</p>
<p>（總結）再，該農塲還順便勵導農民注意淸潔衛生，每星期要洗澡一次，（熱天洗澡便在晨塲前面堰塘，因該堰塘注意水之淸潔，同時又為一游泳池。）要到他們的家裏去檢查淸潔一次，並逐漸打破鄉間迷信，及儉省喪葬制和結婚費等。農民因在生活上都受了些實在的利益，所以對該農塲這些要求，都欣然地接受了。在這最後要談及的：為經營該農塲，究化了若干本錢？嚴格說：只化了修房子的二千多大銀元。因全山開墾後，雖共有三千多畝地，而每年租金却只有十元。讀者也許不相信，但事實確是這樣，根本上原因，由過去許多人都看成為無用的荒地去了。不圖一經實行兵墾便證明了成功，所以盧作孚先生，為該農塲大門的左右石灰粉牆面，題有斗大的十四個字，為：「舉鋤將大地開拓，提兵向自然進攻」云。</p>

<h3>北海</h3>
<p>— 北平特信</p>
<p>—北平景勝之一—　概觀</p>
<p>北海·南海·中海·中由公園·太廟·古物陳列所·以及歷史博物院·等處所、相隣甚近、在昔原為帝王之家苑·祖廟·及宮殿、與附近之皇城內故宮、同為禁地、平民百姓、無緣窺其形勝、民國以降、此等處所、乃前後先故宮而開放、於是其佈置之瑰奇、建築之宏麗、與夫風景之幽絕、率皆暴露於人們眼簾之下、而引起無限之驚羨、民國十三年、溥儀出宮後、故宮亦卽於次年（十四年）開放、自茲以後、此區域以內、乃可暢遊無阻、無論佈置·建築·以及風景、皆為北平首屈一指之處所、且地點適居北平之中央、交通便利、故每日吸引之遊人、均以萬計、異國來賓、他鄉遊客、凡一遊其地者、莫不嘖嘖稱羨、留連而不忍遽去、北海為著名之三海其　就是三個湖上翹楚、地居故宮之北、與中海以金鮝玉　橋為界、前門迎南、在團城之東側、後門迎北、與十刹海隔路相望、進前門、不數十步、卽為北海、海中有瓊華島、過橋一座、卽至島上、上島以後、通常遊逛者、大率有三路可走、山島之東側、繞行數百步、過橋而至海之外沿、或不過橋而至漪瀾堂、此一路也由島之西測、繞行至漪瀾堂、此又一路也、直趨北、穿堆雲坊、上白塔山、經永安寺等處、由山之北麓、穿石洞而下、至漪瀾堂、此第三路也、至漪瀾堂後、大率僱划子遊海、或搭大船過海、至北岸之五龍亭、然又有由瓊華島東側過橋沿海之東北岸、繞行一里許、以達五龍亭者、遊北海者、因各人所抱之志趣不同、故所取之途徑亦異、然總而言之、其所抱之志趣、决不出三類、（一）逛山並遠眺北平全市、（二）遊海並賞荷、（三）品茗納凉並淸談消夏、</p>
<p>登山遠眺</p>
<p>園中惟一之山、厥為瓊華島上之白塔山、此山無城外西山之高大、亦不及近在咫尺煤山之雄偉、但結構玲瓏、形勢獨勝、其樹木蔭翳、與夫矗立水中之二點、在北平各山內、尤為不可多得、</p>
<p>穿堆雲坊、上白塔山後、在山之南麓、首至永安寺、寺中有廣寒殿、法輪殿、法輪殿後、有亭二、再後、為正覺殿及普安殿、共有殿四亭額、雖皆網絡塵封、色彩斑駁、但由其雕梁　棟上觀、仍可臆想其當日之規模、與夫繁盛之狀况也、殿悉依山坡之形勢而築、殿與殿之間、各有石級數十層、遊人於遊殿之際、亦卽同時逐步登山、逮遊完出寺、蓋已於不知不覺間登山之絕頂矣、登山誠苦事、而於遊逛中行之、並不感其倦怠、用意亦誠大妙、殿內、除金佛及羅漢等像外、無足多觀、遊人至此、所以徘徊不忍去者、不過因撫摩遺跡與發懷古之幽情耳、二殿與三殿之間、不知何處、設有無綫電收音機一具、而音又不淸晰、終日咿咿啞啞、殊覺刺耳、與山中寂　之空氣、頗不調和、正覺殿與普安殿、平時人不能入其中、故登山者、通常由石洞旁之石級登臨而上、</p>
<p>白塔山、因頂有白塔一座而得名、此塔原為喇嘛教式之建築、與普通之所謂「浮圖」七級者、大不相同、最下層作方形、稍上為扁圓形、如舊式之食盒、再上為橢圓形、如倒覆之罄、再上為特長聳立之圓錐、錐頂又有如帽如傘藍者二層、最上始為葫蘆形之頂、此塔的高十餘丈、全身作乳白色、前何應欽在平主持軍分會時、會捐欵修葺、故煥然一新、日光映之、在翠綠叢中、殊屬嘵有畫意、此塔無由登臨、塔前有善因殿、殿左右各有白礬石階梯數十級、拾級而上、卽至善因殿、殿門封鎖、人不能入、惟殿外四週墻壁、均係翠緣及嫩黃之琉璃磚砌成、每塊磚上、均浮雕尺許高之小佛一座、總計四壁、不下數百座、惟小佛之鼻、大率為人挖去、無一完整、不知何故、有謂係山於訛傳鼻內嵌有金寶者、又有謂係遊人偶然挖去者、亦不知執是、殿內供鎮海佛一座、（又名千手千眼佛）像為銅身坐像、高的丈餘、貌頗猙獰可怖、頭凡三層、其下層者且三出、雙手有十餘隻、脚有五六排、全付武裝、手執各式各樣之武器、脚踏奇形怪狀之烏·獸·及人類、而腰帶頸飾、則累累者、皆人頭也、</p>
<p>善因殿居山之絕頂、立其前、可縱覽北平全市風景、遠之、則山影雲光、黃瓦紅牆、近之、則荷　瀰望、遊船如蜓、而樹葉如海、一遍蒼　、允足為故都生色、令人塵念頓消、遊人紛紛取攝影機以收此畫意詩情之景、孰知隨風傳來之「達達達達……」聲、卽為某國兵士以機關槍實彈打靶之聲乎、</p>
<p>山頂後側、有琳光殿、此處設有茶座、可以一面品茗、一面坐賞山北面之風景、殿旁之閱古樓石壁中、嵌有御定三希堂法帖、由此、卽為下山之路、惟與上山時光景、又復不同、蓋上山為穿殿而過、此則為鑽石洞、或繞遊廊而下也、石洞、遊廊、均極險陡、驀視之、實覺兢兢不敢動步、但結構巧妙、到處有欄杆及扶手可依、惟高跟鞋及硬底皮鞋之屬、亦可通行無碍、累得面紅心跳、汗流浹背者則有之、而失足滑跌之事、則未之常見、</p>
<p>山之西側、及東側、無大足觀、有之、亦不過樹木森森、怪石崢嶸而已、故通常遊山者不常至、大率由山之北麓而下、以至漪灘堂、漪瀾堂面臨海水、迥廊曲抱山之東北麓、廊長凡數十丈、紅漆廊柱與白石欄杆、相映如書、有茶座、有飯座、遊船及過海赴五龍亭者均以此為起點、</p>
<p>水上風光</p>
<p>三海之水、源出城外之玉泉山、在元朝、名為太掖池、北海者、其北段也、水由後門之水閘流進、潺潺作聲、污穢之泥沙雜物、悉被摒阻閘外、故水甚淸冽、深處有丈餘深、普通者、則在三數尺左右、其中遍植荷花、荷葉密不見水、淸風徐來、幽香中人欲醉、遊魚時時跳躍其中、潑刺之聲、使幽雅之氛圍、並添詩意、船分大船小艇二種、大船除搭客之渡船外、亦可包僱、惟係由船伕代撑、僱此等大船者、大率為家庭全體出遊、或友朋甚衆、且欲於其中飲酒喫飯也、此種大船、作畫舫式、佈置頗雅潔、的有十餘隻、小艇則作兩頭尖之橄欖形、長的丈餘、三人乘之、最為合適、過此則嫌擁擠、庭身漆作膠白色、槳均漆成綠色、如能划獎得法、亦可其去如飛、此種小艇、第一點鑛須租費八角、第二點鍊可以减至五角、一般遊人、仍不免嫌其昂貴、然為水光山色所誘、亦往往欲罷不能、此種小艇、約有數十隻、</p>
<p>海水以東·北·西·三面較寬、水面立有椿柱、絆以鐵絲、劃出遊船之航道、遊艇可以由漪瀾堂起、環繞環華島而行、普通環繞此島一週、的需半小時至一小時、但一般情形、均祗往來划行於東北面之漪瀾堂與五龍亭問之水面、或島西側之水面、然亦有為好奇心所動、繞島而行者、則須經橋孔數道、其中凉氣浸浸、孔壁上夕陽斜照下至水光　　、自又是一番風味、</p>
<p>水面上、笑語喧呼、行歌互答、以言人種、則身驅胖大、遠視亦覺龐然、時時取望遠鏡、或照相機置諸眼際者、歐美之白種人也、滿船相對肅然、男子一律短髭一撮、女子一律背若駝峯者、某友邦之人士也、至於吾國人士、驟視之、外觀似無大區別、但試一細聽其語言、則「死（北平「喜」字音）快（北平「跨」字音）哉、）吳下嬌娃之軟駡也、「唷怎麼回事兒、你這是、」響亮之北乎責問語也、其有聲勢洶洶、述聲喝問、「幹啥呀、幹啥呀、」則東三省人士也「要（北平「姚」字音）得（北平「的」字音）要得」則四川人也、總之、各省方言、無不應有盡有、偶爾亦有印度人朝鮮人及安南人之屬、來此遊船、亦毫無瑟縮、此點足見故都之廣大與無所不容、</p>
<p>白日遊船、以夕陽西下、斜映水面如金綫萬道時為最佳、然晚上、在彩色燈光裏、淡白月光中、及燦爛星光下、一葉容與、數聲欵乃、亦別有風味、較諸白日為更富詩意、五龍亭在海之北外沿、均突出水中、中亭尤為突出、餘四亭左右各各對稱、五亭之間、有灣曲之堤相聯、中亭曰「龍澤」、其餘為「從祥」·「滋香」·「湧瑞」：「浮翠」·前臨碧水、後枕假山、美葉繁茂於週遭、樹蔭搖曳於尾角、淸風陣陣、遊魚時時浮出水面、爭食投下之瓜子壳、人坐此中、眞有與萬物同化之概、而溽暑之氣，乃完全消失、堪稱納凉之佳地、</p>
<p>五亭中、均設有茶座·飯座·冷熱飲食、一應俱全、價目比外面稍昂、惟口味亦好、五　共有座數百、炎熱時、常常客滿、後來者、則在亭外之堤上設座、此中有商人哲士之高談闊論、有詩人學者之獨自品茗、其他許多社會上煊嚇一時之人物、亦間或來此一現身影、但一切秩序井然、雖有全家在此用飯、或排席斟酒、大宴賓客、亦不覺其煩雜、若夫靑年男女、借此作談心之處、則史屬司空見慣、其伺者亦大率彬彬有禮、予人以愉快之印象、</p>
<p>停留時間方面、有稍坐卽去者、有終日逗留者、惟晚十一點以後、卽搖鈴歇肆、不能再作逗留、</p>
<p>其最有意味者、厥為夏日雨後之晚問、試携椅隔水對漪瀾堂一坐、則燈彩閃灼於水中、如彩柱數百、蛙聲喧囂於座右、猶若春　、魚躍潑刺之聲、時時出自荷內、蝙蝠翩翩翱翔於光明與黑晴之間、再加之一卷詩篇在握、則此景此情、絕非筆墨語言所能形容其於萬一、彷彿已非人間、但一念及此為危城之故都、則又覺　然若失、言之殊　　　之至·</p>

<h3>國貿標準化　與國民心理建設　許曉初</h3>
<p>七月二十八日，在上海電報局播昔台，國貨播音演講詞如下。諸位聽衆，今天所講的題目似乎太廣泛點，在簡短的二十分鐘內，當然難以詳盡。但據個人觀感所及，以為無論對國貨生產界，或國貨的消費者，雙方從提倡國貨的論點說起，認為本題確有提出以供國人討論之價值。所以特地概括的合各位來研究一下。</p>
<p>近年來國內工商業，因為多方面的提倡和推進，確較以前進步得多。但是從國貨廠商本身來打聽，不僅是普通的輕工業頗多暗中呌苦連天的，就是具有相當歷史和基礎的大工廠，也不少搖搖欲墜，幾將瀕於不可牧拾者。不景氣的愁雲瀰漫全球，我國自亦不能例外。產業界之衰落，此固為原因之一，但國貨不足以與外貨傾銷相抗衡，確為最大的一個原銀電。說起此層自然也複雜，不過國貨之欠標準化，實為一般的通病。我們所需要的貨物，沒有國製。品那目然只好讓外國貨獨佔市塲。却是旣已有了國貨，仍舊不能遏制外貨的猖獗，細究其故，多數是因為同業競爭，以致粗製濫造，貶價求售所促成的。在廠商本身戴了一副近視鏡，捨本逐末，自相殘殺，終於同歸於盡，固然罪有應得。但在愛用國貨者方面，因為每每失望結果，亦便為之灰心，國貨之失收大率原因在此。以上專指國內而言，若更從國際貿易上著眼，那允糟了，不是粗陋不值一顧，就是起頭還好，以後划一次貨一個樣子，前後不一致優劣失常態，使友者蹙額，而授敵以隙，國貨的信用旣失，以後縱有較好的貨物，向外發展，亦必蒙受重大影響。因為以一例百，是人類通常的心理，所以與其拿粗陋的製品，向國外推銷，使全部國貨受輕視，成為國貨界的罪人，那還是不去的好。說到這裏，有人主張趕快設法統制工業，增加同業公會的力量，以便糾正此種不良的現象，固然是份內的事。但是無論採取何種方式，總須注重貨物標準化，使人人愛用，樂於提倡，那纔是最緊要的辦法。譬如熱水瓶，外國貨每只賣三元五元的都有，仍奮有人勝用。反觀國貨每只賤賣到五角，倒落得一個「絕無好貨」的批評。熱水瓶廠的多數不能維持，也就是種因於此。俗語說得好：一份價錢一份貨，外國貨售價較高，反而博得社會的信任，因此委實是國貨而竟冒充外國貨的也就發現了。所以我們國貨廠商應知精益求精，不應該僅知粗製濫造，貶價競售，要知道老牌子的美譽，就是賣得起價錢的原因，營業的發展，不一定在一味的跌價，這是當今我們國貨生產界所應該覺悟的一點。</p>
<p>此外與「標準化」有連帶關係的，還有應當注意於時代之推進，和社會之所好，以為製造出品之對象。據聞東鄰某布廠，在向南洋羣島推進之前，特派職員多人，前去實地調查，該處人民之習尚與嗜好，每到一地，立於通衝要道口，一連三天，觀察往來人民服裝之花樣和色彩種類等項，作為記錄製成統計，以見各該地人民一般之所好，回去作為織造布疋之標準，因此運往推銷到處歡迎。（未完）</p>

<h3>兒童訓練的繼續努力</h3>
<p>— 朱春</p>
<p>今天是上海市舉行兒童年閉幕典禮的一天。在這盛大的典禮之下。我們應當檢討政府的提高兒童地位，注意兒童幸福，究竟是為了什麽？這是很明顯的，因為兒童是復興民族的基本隊伍，所以我們對於兒童身體的鍜鍊，智禁的培育，德性的修養，都是意兒童幸福的重大問題。進一步言：就是一偭民族的全體組成份子，要是都是身體病弱，智慧落後，德性墮落，那末自趨於滅亡，為必然的結果。</p>
<p>中華民族有四五千年的歷史，是世界上最優秀的一個民族，到了現在，受到帝國的壓迫與凌辱，快要到埋沒我們民挨光榮史頁的一天了。這是什麽緣故呢？這就是因為異族入主中國，在科舉政策的毒燄下，在異族崎視的壓迫下，埋葬了兒童幸福的結果。我們要打破民族的危機，燒燬頭上的枷鎖，澈底改造社會，最先要的，當然就是訓練兒童；</p>
<p>訓練兒童的主要問題：要使他們認淸個人，國家，民族的當前環境；進而要使他們負起打破惡劣環境的責任！但是訓練兒童，决不是短時間的，决不是「兒童年」一週年期內可以完畢他們的任務的。所謂「十年樹木，百年樹人」，我們知道過去一週的兒童年，不過是促起社會人七對於兒童幸福的注意，與訓練兒童開始。</p>
<p>今而後，我們對於兒童的幸福事業，必須更續努力。推廣到全社會去。從少數兒童，開始到多數兒童，從受教育的兒童，展開到貧苦而失學的兒童，使全民族所包括的兒童，都有一個健全的身體，敏捷的頭腦，高超的德性，來打好我們民族復興的基礎，湔雪我們中華民族史上的恥辱！</p>
<p>目前世界文明各國，對於兒童的幸福事業，沒有不是儘量推進的。尤其是蘇俄，德國，日本等國家，他們對於兒童的訓練，都是在奮力推進，所以它們的吼聲，漸漸地將要震動全世界了。我們震前懾後，要防衛民族的生存，就應當不放棄兒童的訓練！</p>
<p>兒童年過去了，將來兒童事業委員會的永久組織，我們希望它更要發展它的責任！</p>
<h3>現代社會對於兒童之　教養應如何注意</h3>
<p>— 張輝</p>
<p>光陰荏苒，兒童年閉幕矣，在此一年中，兒童幸福實施之效果如何？自有公論；但現代社會對於兒童問題，應如何注意，吾不得不再為社會人士言之！</p>
<p>檢閱過去社會，對餘兒童，大多加以摧殘，村老或父母操生殺之　，如印度數處父母，可以任意殺戮子女，日本以女孩祭獸神，中國亦有以兒童祭橋之風俗，自十九世紀，福祿培爾出，對於兒童遂稍注意，雖革除體罰，注意感化，然失之太放任，且染有迷信色彩，及二十世紀蒙台梭利出，乃以兒童為中心，以自由為教養本旨，然太重理論，及後心理學猛晋，兒童學之研究，不乏其人，對於兒童問題，遂由全歐風行美陸，由個人提倡，而變為國家之贊助，由飭吹而變為事實之設施，我國近年來對於兒童問題之探討，亦一日千里，兒童年之規定，無非喚起國人有更切實之注意。</p>
<p>然兒童問題，何以引起現代社會如此玆重？蓋現代社會為一動的現象，其文化由於人類之創造，而今之成人，卽過去之兒童，而現代之兒童，卽未來之成人，亦卽未來社會之柱石也。故一民族之盛衰，一國家之興隆，一事業之成敗，固應觀乎現代人之努力與吾？負責與吾？但欲社會蒸蒸日上，日進不已，對於現代成人，固不可不注意，而對於兒童，允不可不注意焉！失敗者須賴是輩恢復，成功者亦須賴是輩光揚！昔俾士麥以普法之戰，歸功於教養兒童之方，滑足信也！故現代社會對於兒童，應本百年樹人之大計，循循善誘，然後菁裴蔚起，可收事半功倍之效！匪特此也，兒童時彈性最大，兒童自有兒童之本性，若以成人意見教養兒童，是不啻摧殘兒童，無論在家庭之父母，在學校之教師，英隨兒童之興趣，而敎以目前社會所需要之一切　識與技能。</p>
<p>兒童對社會關係既如此密切，而兒童之敎養，又如是複雜，現代社會對於兒童之教養，安可忽視耶？今兒童年閉幕矣；吾願社會人士，對於兒童之教養問題，應三致意焉！</p>
<h3>現代父母對於兒童應負之責任</h3>
<p>— 張輝秉</p>
<p>兒童為未來社會之主人，欲鞏固未來社會之基礎，不可不注意兒童問題，同時不可不注意父母問題；蓋有現代之兒童，不可無現代之父母，有現代之父母，而後始有現代之兒童也。</p>
<p>兒童為社會之基礎，則為父母者盡教養之道，使子女成一良好之國民，足為現代父母矣，日，未也，因古代民生簡陋，知識淺薄，為父母者，盡教養之道甚易，時至今日，知識之部門日繁，舉鬥之技術日專，非父母可以並蓄兼覽，且身為事業所忙，亦無優遊之時間，可以教養，則為父母者，將子女交與社會，可盡現代父母之責任矣，日，猶未也，然則，現代父母對於兒童應負之責任果何如？管見所及，試言於次：</p>
<p>甲、對於兒童方面：</p>
<p>（一）負責施與預備式教育兒童在勢不得不與父母脫離，但又非完全脫離父母，故在父母親近兒童之時，應隨時隨地施以預備教育，為將來正式教育之基礎焉。</p>
<p>（二）負責施與補習式驕傲　兒童旣受正式學校教育，為父母者，仍應隨時隨地施以補習教育，輔助學校教育之因難與不足。</p>
<p>乙、對於自身方面：</p>
<p>（一）應明瞭兒童心理兒童時代個性最强，彈性最大，好問，喜遊戲，為父母者應本兒童之心理，循循善誘，以納於正軌，切不可以成人之態度，而任意處置也。</p>
<p>（二）應明瞭社會狀况為父母者，不但應明白兒童心理，同時對於現代社會所需要，目前生存所迫切之諸問題，亦應有相當之了解，如此，則使兒童造成有用之成人，有益於人類之成人，能適應現代社會之主人矣！現代父母，能具備上列各項，不特現代兒童之幸，亦卽民族之光也，吾願現代父母，注意及之！</p>

<p>（八月二日）第一雙打周冠軍與劉階、第二雙打李國墦與胡旭光、</p>
<h3>美麗杯雙打複賽　昨日李明被淘汰　卡遜史規亞以三對一獲決賽權　何劉對柯考未解決定今日續賽</h3>
<p>康悌公開網球美麗盃雙打賽、經多日之淘汰、昨已開始複賽、結果卡遜史規亞以三對一勝李國璠胡旭光、得决賽權、何家鎏劉堦對柯拉沙柯斯坦組、各勝兩盤、因天已入暮、經雙方同意、改於今日下午五時續賽、賽畢勝者卽與卡遜史規亞組决奪錦標、按康悌本屆公開賽單打中、我國人晉達複賽週者、僅羅民　一人、决賽時盡為外人之天下、雙打入複賽週者、亦僅何劉與李胡兩組、李胡組不幸昨日已被淘汰、祇何劉組之他錢希冀耳、今日果能獲收佳果、但同時卽須决賽、錦標前途暗淡已極、昨日複賽戰情誌下、</p>
<p>卡史組　獲決賽權</p>
<p>卡遜史規亞之勝李國墦與胡旭光、原為意中事、昨賽李胡組得開球權先獲一局後、卡史組卽連勝四局、旋李胡組又扳回兩局、第一盤卽以三比六失去、第二盤更屬不景氣、至五比另後、方扳轉一局、轉瞬又以一比六連失、第三盤李胡聲勢煊赫、一舉連下三局、雖於三比另後、被卡史組速得兩局、但不久李胡又連勝三局、以六此二扳回一盤、第四盤中卡遜奮發、上網攔殺、四比另後、胡旭光以開球獲一局、以後兩局李胡巳無鬥志、一比六再失第四盤、總結果三對一、卡遜史規亞組獲决賽權、昨胡旭光則頗能發揮其實力比數如下</p>
<p>另一場　今日續賽</p>
<p>另塲如何家鎏劉堦對柯拉沙考斯坦、雙方球藝、彼此匹敵、昨賽第一盤何劉上塲頗見生疏、一氣連失四局、旋成五比一、何家鎏再以猛壓得局、但不久以二比六失去第一槃、决盤開始何劉組先導一局、迨三比三後、何劉以佳妙之抽擊、連得三局、以六比三扳回、第三盤柯拉沙組先得一局、何家鎏組以二比一超出、前途頗現光明、詛偶一疏忽、又連失三局、旋追至三比四、至四比五時、頗有平等希望、在極度緊張之空氣下、竟被柯考組以六比四勝去、第四盤為勝負關頭、何劉更屬小心翼翼、以一比另先導後，柯考又以二比一起出、旋劉堦挽救不少險球、何家鎏亦上前攔殺、連勝三局、第七局在兩次平等後、被考斯坦以兩記高壓勝去、最後又經何劉之努力、以六比三扳回、至此各勝兩盤、天已垂暮、視綫不淸、雙方同意展至明日舉行决勝盤、</p>
<p>（未完今日下午五時續賽）</p>
<p>今日秩序</p>

<h3>市府同人網球賽</h3>
<p>市體育塲主辦之市府同人網球賽、除雙打業於前日結束外、昨原有單打兩塲、旋吳毓華棄權於王華彬、故僅有黃華對馬有成一塲交鋒、現下王華彬已得十一分、黃華亦得九分、兩人均未失過一盤、故錦標常為兩人所必爭、又今日比賽停止、昨賽結果如下、</p>

<p>申報文藝週刊都市一角的黃昏  林石　　雖說都市的熱天委　使人氣悶，可是到底還有一個可愛的黃昏。而這黃昏在熱鬧地段的空塲裏更能顯出它的可愛。　　從東首望去，可以看到聳立在一座高屋頂上的大時鐘。西方的太陽已經落下了馬路盡處的某富宅花園的樹梢頭，只暫留下它微笑的光芒反射在大自鳴鐘的玻璃上閃爍着，幻出燦爛的顏色。馬路兩旁的樹木，翠葱葱也迎接着紅潤的斜陽，不要多少時候，它們便在晚風中吐出淸凉的氣味。空塲上的靑草，也似乎活潑了許多，當它們給熾熱的太陽曝晒得過於疲乏，而現在便讓柔和的風搖動着腰肢，閒散的休息着。　　樓頭少女，披着輕薄的羅紗，敞開窗戶乘受着凉風冰凉她的肌膚。柔軟的頭髮薰沐着香水的芬芳。也許是午睡方醒，也許是蘭湯浴罷。微紅的臉映着落日的餘暉。半掩着窗簾靜對着這空塲遙望。　　除了臨窗的少女而外，在這空塲上還有許多閒散的人們。穿着白府綢，白紡綢或是黑香雲紗的短衣。捲起袖口，　在地下。吸着他們的香烟，吹着他們的口哨，逗着他們的得眉歌唱。失去了自由的畫眉，和少數的白頭翁或八哥一樣，好像牠們已經習慣了牠們禁閉的生活而忘却了牠們飛翔的本能。牠們滿不在乎的呌着，逗樂着他們的主人，從主人手裏啄取一條虫或者是一粒粟，牠們滿足了。　　每一個人都能找出一個適當的理由，當他們要做着每一件自己所要做的事情的時候。所以養烏的人們，懶得連消磨光陰的方法都沒有，不得不提着鳥籠在人世間溜達溜達，也未嘗不是他們生活的理山。　　外國兵營在兵士們敬禮聲中卸下他們的國旗。這空塲上的人們，對於這很習慣的望了一眼，在他們心中沒有任何感想。可是一隻解開了轡頭的外國狗，追逐着另一隻小狗在草地上奔馳，却引起人們很大的興趣。而給外國主人派出來陪著狗一同散步的小伙子，跟在狗的背後　喝着，奔跑着，掛着滿臉的汗，於是這空塲上閒散的人們都笑開了，連窗戶前的少女也笑開了。　　狗和人在追逐着，烏在歌唱着，人們在歡笑着，和夕陽的嘻笑一同歡樂。　　在沿馬路的一面，有三兩個賣虫的人。他們多是遙遠的自山東流浪到這個都市裏來，為着職業，為着妻兒父母的飢餓。但是失業恐慌的陰影，跟着每一個不幸者從鄉村走到都市，他們仍然是失業，仍然是飢餓。然而他們並不能就此感覺着人生的絕望，至少他們的妻兒子女也迫着他們不能作絕望的想念，所以他們還得用盡一切方法生活下去。　　有多少人在巷口的垃圾桶裏尋找着能值半文錢的爛鐵破布，有多少人在馬路上拾着香烟屁股，有多少人……道種種都成為人們的生活方式；而這自北方流徙到南方的一羣，他們也找着了一種生活方式，那便是尋找淸各式各樣的草心中的幼虫，甘心情願的作為烏的供奉者。　　為了這也是一種生活的法門，他們每天絕早的淸晨，便向離這都市很逮的鄉間走去。從淸晨到下午，他們不斷的尋找有虫的茅草。由於自己的經騐，他們從枯萎的葉子上可知道那茅草梗的中心有他們所需要的虫在潛伏着。用了小刀將梗割斷，剝去包着梗的葉子，再將有虫的一斷截得整整齊齊，然後五十根一綑的紮起來。就是這樣。他們得在茅草叢中擠進擠出。茅草的每一根長葉都是一柄長刀，這千萬柄的長刀使以草為食料的牛羊也不敢去傷害它，可是這貧賤得比牛羊還不如的人們却不能不去和它拚命，於是他們赤裸的脚上，手臂上，乃至於沒有衣服遮蓋的臉上以及其他每一塊肉，都給這千萬柄長刀割成千萬綫傷痕了。從今天到明天，從初夏到秋殘，他們繼續着沒有停止。那宋舊的傷痕沒有脫痴，新的傷痕又添加上去。在這斜陽的天氣，這，眞正的烏們的供奉者，袒露着他們鮮血淋漓的創傷，蓆坐在空塲中，苦笑在這多少竹籠中畫眉和白頭翁的歌聲裏。　　「幾個銅板一把？」烏的主人少不了要和他們講生意了。而回答的是山東延州的土腔，咬着上海白：　　「老闆！不討虛頭，規規矩矩，他百錢一把。」　　「瞎話三千，人家才賣八個銅板一把，儂為哈要賣十個？」　　「他們那個是什麽東西？　這個是什麽貨色？他們那個虫是什麽虫？空的，有虫也是死了的，　這個根根有，有死了的不要錢。他們的一把不到四十根，　這個五十根足。賣您老闆十個銅板一把，要合一個子兒五根，多便宜。……」　　買主也蹲下來仔細的辦看貨色，拿着一根兩頭看看說　　「儂看，空格，有虫也跑脱哉。」　　「跑掉啦！那有的事。」於是當面剝開來：「瞧！這不是虫？多大！多粗！你老闆到那兒也找不着。」臉上是勝利的笑了。　　「九個銅板一把，賣　？　　「那不行，九十五個錢我也不賣。」　　買主跑開了，拿着剝出來一條虫，立刻又蹲到另一個賣主面前去。這使他發急了，馬上為了同行的競爭跌價了。　　「喂，一百九十錢兩把要麽？」　　「弗要，九十鈿一把，多一個也弗要。」　　「好好好，拿聲把去罷。沒有辦法，只好便宜　。」愁苦的臉，埂着額上的靑筋。又說：「只買一把麼？老闆，帮帮忙多買一把罷！」　　「要價多做啥？」揀了一把頂滿意的，丟下九個銅板就　到自己的烏籠面前去了。就算是十個銅板一把罷，一天能賣到吊把錢也算是頂多了。一家人就靠着這吊把錢生活，而這就是唯一的生活法門了。　　烏在吃飽了幼虫之後，自然也呌喚得特別起勁。可是黃昏的時光到底不可久留，慢慢的便在空塲上蓋上了薄暮的灰暗。閒散的人們，將烏籠蒙起黑布來，讓牠們開始夜的安宿。狗依然套上了蠻頭，被牽着走回外國主人家裏去，牛腓或火腿在等候牠受用。賣虫的人們懶懶的收拾起賣不掉的虫，帶着新的傷痕和飢餓走回家去，可惜這許多爬虫不能當做飯吃。樓頭少女也不知在什麽時候隱去了，從窗户裏給晚風飄來濃艷的無綫電的歌聲。　　一切都將安靜了。只有一連十幾輛的軍用機器脚踏車，滿載着武裝的「友邦」士兵，雄糾糾的大概練習巷戰回來，現在是駛回營去。這些，對於租界上的閒散的人們，也並不驚奇，因為近數年來，他們早已習慣了。日暮  TK歌德的自由思想  齊復　　「太初有行“Im　Anfang　War　dre　Tat”這是浮士德開篇的名句，也就是唯物論實踐論的極好的註脚，徵見這個偉大的詩人的前進的思想。第一次讀浮士德的時候，便給這句饒有哲學意味的一針見血的話所吸引。在歌德自傳中，我們也可發現一些與這種實踐論互相發明的地方。比方他論到當時的兩個詩人Klopstook和Gleim的自高聲價時，他便說：「從道兩人所予的精神的影響看來，無疑地可稱他們為偉大的人物，但是站在廣大的世界之前，他們不過貧弱。日永而夜又迢迢，我們不能老是做詩，或誘導別人作詩，……因此他們在其特殊狹小的關係範圍內太自高其聲價，把自己日常的努力和作事視為重要，這種重要性只有他們自己之間才容認吧……」（第二部第十卷）由這句話我們可以看見歌德怎樣重視實際的生活，外界的人生，對於終日只知吟詩而脫離現實社會關係的文人痛下針砭。　　從歌德的時代和社會環境看來，歌德的思想的前進是不足怪的。他本生於德國有名的自由市佛蘭克福城，他的靑年時代正是法國盧騷狄德羅等的自由思想盛行的時代，而德國－特別普魯士的資本主義也在開始興起，封建制度已破綻百出了。誠然，他的山商人而晉於貴族的家世，使他對於逝去的封建的光榮不無多少捲戀，但以大體而論，他是新與的，革命的市民階級的思想上的先驅。就是歌德自傳也現出這種社會意識的一鱗一爪。例如佛郎克福城在十七世紀初年會起過一次民衆反抗腐敗的市政府的暴動，平服之後，這些叛徒的首領梟首示衆，他們的頭　到歌德靑年時代還懸在梅茵河橋上。好奇的歌德研究這樁故事的結果，便認識了他們的暴動的革命的性質，而對他們大表同情。他說：「我不禁替這些不幸的人們可惜，我們應當把他們看做是犧牲者，藉着他們才得到後來市府制度的改善」（後來商人和手工業都得參加市政府）（見自傳第一部第四卷）　　不過，歌德由思想的最僥趣味的地方，就是牠洽與那今日宰制德國的希特勒主義成一對照Koutra　t我們都知）道焚書是希特勒上台後思想肅反的第一着，但是這實是中古時代的把戲，而且這種思想鉗制方法到底是遏不住新的思潮的澎湃的。歌德少時也目擊過焚書的喜劇，在自傳（第一部第四卷）中有這樣的話：「我們總會目擊過種種死刑的執行，更值得說的，就是有一種書籍被焚燬時我也在塲。被焚的是一種法國滑稽小說，可是牠所攻擊的不是國家，而宗教和種種禮教。看見刑罰施於一種無生命的東西，的確是一樁可怕的事情。一大綑書籍在火中爆裂着，然後用火鉗把牠們撥弄，俾能與火燄多接觸一點。不消一會工夫，燒過的書在空中片片飛舞，羣衆們爭着把牠們攫到手上來。連我們也非抓到一冊書不肯罷休，有不少人馬上就會設法找到這些禁書。眞的，假如作者要使人周知，他自己的宣傳恐不能够比這個更好一點吧」。這樣說來，希特勒以及一切思想獨裁者的徒勞無功，早已給歌德揶揄够了。　　對於猶太人的態度更可顯出歌德之不固於成見。他除了對猶太的先民阿伯拉罕等費了不少筆墨致其景仰之外，對於當代的猶太人也有好感，他說：「他們也是人類，勤勞而和氣，就使他們堅守他們的習俗的頑固，我們也不可加以鄙視。「說到反猶太人運動時，他更有這樣的話：「近代人對於猶太人的觀念比前好一點，不過在（梅茵河）橋塔之下圓拱牆上有一大幅嘲笑和梅辱他們的盡是異常仇視他們的，現在仍隱的可見，未免使他們不堪了。因為這幅畫並不是出於私人的無賴，而是山公共機關製成」（見同卷。這個非難現在又可以施諸國社黨的德國了。　　這個偉大的詩人－到今日仍為納粹們視為國寶的詩人－死去已有一百零四年了，他的祖國的獨裁者還把他所指摘嘲笑的中世的把戲再拿來當作是得意之作，是歌德太前進，還是希特勒開倒車呢？歌德有知，當也為之憤慨吧！江上哀音  斐兒　　夜，在都市是輝煌的燈火，是搔人心魂的弦歌。在江上，也有明亮的火光，也有歌喉配着樂曲。陸上有溢香的酒味，噴着像濃霧般的烟圈，饗亮的牌子聲發自桌上，并且有的是不景氣下廉價的女人；在水上，一切都沒有變更，只差了一家「俱樂部」却搬在水上。　　蕩吧！搖吧！風吹來，亞熱帶的氣候變遷了；唱吧！玩吧！誰知道什麼是明天？　　可憐的是出賣肉體的「人肉」呢！　　『到明天，　　我的歌喉破了，　　我的血肉爛了，　　屍骨暴露在荒郊（？）！』（船家女曲）　　江上的女人是不會自己唱出這種曲調來的，但是誰知道：她的靈魂會不會唱出這種歌來呢？　　於是江潮幽咽，風吹過了人間的哀調。　　然而：　　『唱吧！唱吧！』　歌聲夾着肉香，究竟誰應知道什麽是明天？懶散的讚美  捷克Karel　Capek作　　今天我需要懶散一下；也許因為懶散是這樣特殊的可愛，或者因為木匠正在下面天井中工作，或者因為太陽正在輝耀着，或者因為其他無數的原因。我需要懶散一下。　　我不需要出去散一會步，因為散步不是懶散；也不需要讀或睡，因為這兩者也都不是懶散；也不需要娛樂我自己一下，更不需要安臥一下，因為懶散旣不是娛樂又不是安臥。懶散，純粹的，完全的懶散，旣不是消閒，也不是煩憂，牠是一件帶些消極性的事；牠是一種與那些專心的，娛樂的，煩憂的，感興趣的，愁悶的，喜悅的，給深刻印象的，急切希求的，難受的，媚惑的，吸引的，或者討厭一個人的事件成了絕緣的狀態。牠是一種空虛，一種否定，一種無目的狀態。牠是一件純粹而罕有的事。　　第一，懶散不是消磨時間。舉例來說，如果我要消磨時間，我會拿篩子去汲水。但當我正在懶散，那就是剛巧是我所不做的事；我不做不必要的事，因為我根本就不做一件事。　　第二，懶散不是壞事之母；旣是完全冷漠無情的，它就不會做任何事之母。它的感情作用不會影響別人，因為如果那些感情作用達到這種目的，牠就不是懶散；它就要做成一件事，它就要有一個目的。　　第三，懶散不是怠惰。去怠惰是根避免做一件一個人應該做而同時希望能够做得省力的事。而去懶散是完全不做一件事，不做一件事，更不希望有一件事。　　去懶也不就是去安臥。如果你是在安臥的，你是做一件有益的事；你是在為其他工作而準備。懶散是與任何過去或未來工作設有聯擊的；牠沒有結果，也沒有前瞻。　　懶散也不是休息的享樂。到太陽中去晒一下，閃一閃你充滿幸福的眼睛，或者嗚嗚地作貓呌，這一切都是一種達到某種目的的動作，因為這至少帶些享樂性，而享樂的本身就有些像個目的。懶散是絕對無目的的；牠旣不尋找休息，也不尋找快樂，而是絕對的空虛。　　休息是一條緩流的小溪，這小溪沉默地翻着水泡和波動着；安臥是一個黑暗和靜止的水塘，在這水上面，浮着那些壞的或帶有烈性的動力的垃圾與泡沫；怠惰是一條小河，上面浮蓋着綠色的水草，泥濘和蝌蚪；但是懶散是靜態的——牠沒有旋律，也無音響　牠也不向前移動。牠不賦與水草，泥濘或蚊蚋以生命。牠的水是死的與透明的。無論牠經歷多久，牠並不變為溫暖的。牠是一成不變的。牠旣無方向，又無內容，更無色味。　　我今天需要懶散一下；不，我需要不想一件事。　　我需要！我需什麽呢，實際上？沒有一件東西；因為那實際上就是懶散。做成像一塊石頭，但不要有重量。做成像一泓水，但不要有返光。做成像一簇雲，但不要有移動。做成像一隻野獸，但不要有飢餓。做成像一個人，但不要有思想。去注視一張向紙上面空洞而光滑的。不要去寫什麽而一直注視下去，等到（出於它的自動）它載滿了黑的書法，字，句，行列，由上至下；一面，第二面與第三面。於是是於是自沒有讀牠的必安；有着濃厚的眞實的深湛的懶散的存在，自不必去再讀一過了，不過把我的眼轉視那爬過窗面第一次春的逃逝，而不去看牠。於是－但懶散那有什麽一定的程序呢？每一個地方，你能找到一件不要做，不要看，不要注視的事。　　當你已經和懶散告別，你醒轉來，你似乎從另一世界回轉來一樣。每一件東西是有一些別扭，有一些隔開，有一點兒不合適，和有點兒勉强；你感覺這樣……這樣的奇怪……結果…哎，你得在你懶散後休息一下。當在休息，你得呵欠一下，再憊懶這末一點兒，再躺下去休息這末一會兒；也只有經過這些，你才能恢復你的一切機能，去做些十分不必要的事。（絡緯譯）東渡途中  齊復　　雖然從沒有打算做順民的念頭，或混一個「日本通」的野心，但是，在中日國交正在「調整」，「二二六」事變還有點新鮮熱辣的當兒，能够跑到日本來「觀光」下，對於我倒是一椿不可多得的事。聽說「二·二六」事變以後，日本當局對於外國人特別提防，為免着上岸時的麻煩，為着徹頭徹尾嘗嘗東洋的風味，便特揀由香港直至南美西岸的××丸坐去。乘客除了幾十個坐三等艙往秘魯的舊客以外，便沒有幾個人，頭二等更像是擺擺樣子。到了快開船點名的時候，三等客中有二十多個想先在橫濱上陸然後再設法往秘魯的，給船頭官」看出破綻趕上岸去了。他們忽忙搬行李時焦急懸慮的神態，隱告我們以華僑的來路。卽使在切在船裏的秘魯客中，也有好些是過了中年的人，從他們的早白的頭髮，帶點呆戆的目光和表情，以及黯淡的談話，我們更深深感到這條「水」已沒有甚麼前途。比起日本在南美－特別是秘魯巴西－的移民和貿易的發展來，更不消說了。　　渦了四天的風平浪靜的單調生活，便到了門司－日本的大煤港和軍事的要地，下關（卽馬關條約的馬關）要塞的對岸了。將到的時候、，船客們已接到一個禁止攝影測繪的書面警告，在國際間諜戰正酣的當兒，這自是戰爭的感覺特別敏的日人應有的一着。船才泊定，便有六七個門司的水警上船來盤查乘客了。他們都是神氣十足的：口口聲聲稱先生，懂得中國話的奸猾的老頭子，說得上英文，傲慢的靑年譯員，同是像煞有介事般一審問」着，一個身邊不名一錢的廣東小商人，和旣沒有辦護照（赴日本本來不須護照），也沒帶甚麼證明書的我，便特別成了他們審問的目的物，除了要報告極詳細的履歷，出示所有的錢之外，還要開行李給他們一一檢查，幸而我沒有帶甚麽書，使他們省去一點檢視之勞。但是，結果，那位小商人和我都受了在門司「上陸禁止」的處分。還不知為甚麼，把我的零錢也封起來，交給船事務長暫時保管。「×君我勸你還是從橫濱回去好，否則岸便會有許多麻煩！」這是那位英文譯員臨走時對我的忠告兼恐嚇。　　日本的第一關雖給我以一個欠「友誼的」不快的印象，但過了門司後，日本內海瀨戶海－所謂「日本地中海」－的風物，倒多少洗去我的悲憤的心情：柔軟的綠色海水，時時出沒的雪帆，滿着靑翠，時或有樓閣玲瓏點綴着，蒼松映水槎枒地欹着的相屬的島嶼，給一層輕綃似的薄霧籠眾着，日光曈曈地欲破霧而出，眞使人有海上神山的縹緲之感。　　船泊神戶時，水警的面目雖沒有那樣的猙獰，並且「恩准」我上陸游覽。登岸的時候，恰是黃昏初過，從碼頭踱過了一兩條頗冷靜的馬路，便到了有輝煌的燈火的市中心而所謂「夜市街」的元町也給人一望就看出來了。元町是一條密密排列着小商店，不許通車輛的小馬路。五光十色，燦然雜陳的裝飾品店，洋貨店，和糕餅店，恍惚蘇州觀前街的光景，而從小胡同流出來的酒吧的冶蕩的音樂，在胡同口裏張頭望着的艷裝的「女給」（女招待），以及時雜着外國人和海客的行人，又給牠以一種濃厚的商港氣味，使人有點想起夏天的烟台來。行人中的靑年女人是不少的　她們曳着的雖是各不相同的畫一般的“Kimono”而同是漆着一樣濃厚，埋沒了眞面目的脂粉。一進到元町裏，最映目的，最使人歎賞的，却是那在兩旁密密列着的電燈柱。每根柱子的上端懸着四盞明亮帶白圓罩的電燈，並且向着街心前彎着，因此兩旁相對着的電燈便造成差不多一個圓拱。在牠底下隨意踱着的疲乏的海客，旣融在一片溫柔的光輝中，同時眼前又迎來望之無盡的這種整齊的美，便不由得不把脚步兒放慢了。神戶也像別的華僑薈萃的海外都市那樣，有一條所謂「唐人街」，就在元町的背後，那兒有幾家中華料理－特別是廣東料理－以及中國人開的肉舖子，藥舖，雖不是特別的齷齪，但是，濡濕而不平整的街道，幽暗的燈光，比起旁邊的元町來，有點像是地下的世界。　　第二天，船還不開便冉上岸信步踱到有名的「凑川神社」去，那是一座奉祀十四世紀日本的有名的忠臣（有點像中國的關岳吧）大楠公約廟，殿宇是有幾座的，差不多全是用木頭構成，像日本一切舊式建築物那樣雖不够雄偉宏麗，但饒有簡朴的美：像烏翼般高張的屋角，一片柔和的土黃的木色，門口懸着的略帶藻飾的盒形木燈，又顯出一種壯嚴幽深的氣象。映帶四周的翠綠的老樹，更使整個廟園添點古色古香。神像香燭之類雖不可見，可是，在殿前的拜台上放着一個木槽似的東西，供人佈施錢銀。過兩天便是大楠公約祭期，所以游人頗多，而站在拜臺上俯首合掌的善男信女也接踵不斷，那種虔誠慕敬的神態，倒不减于三跪九叩的老先生們。　　船從神戶再開行後在四日市（一個小城市）和到達港的橫濱，往日本的船都仍逐一給水警訊問，雖終於沒有一個人受「上陸禁止」的處分，但進了國境還逢埠就細加檢查眞是別國所沒有的（不過在國內山西正太路沿綫旅行便有這種情形，）日本偏要還樣不憚煩，恐怕是要對新來的旅客誇示誇示牠的警察網的威力也。在快到橫濱的時候除了要填關於携帶的行李的內容的表外，還要在特備的一張衣上，填報所携帶的書籍的種類，冊數，著作者姓名以至書的內容摘要。日本當局對于「思想犯」一的預防，從這個創舉也露出一點端倪了。浴　  TK斷句  楚陽　　當生命陷入了黑泥坑，　　毒蛇盤據着我底心，　　愛情在苦痛的回憶中又復活了。　　愛情又復活的時候，　　苦痛更像一條緊縛着我的繩，　　生命就是這樣不息地掙扎呀！</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言兒童年閉幕  無次　　轟轟烈烈的兒童年，今天是閉幕了！在這閉幕的時候，照例是必須要有點話說的。——也就因為開幕的時候，有一番冠冕堂皇的話的原故。　　不過要說的話又似乎太多，從那裏說起呢？我想最好的辦法，是拿眼睛去廻顧這一年中有些什麽成就吧？說到成就，除了「開會」，「宣言」以及什麽「工作大綱」之類以外，其他方面，也着實有些點綴，最為人注意的是今年三月間杭州翁家山小學學生組織的「西湖兒童旅行團」到上海來參觀；四月四日兒童節的慶祝大典，本市吳市長在市府接見各校兒童代表時，每人贈送書包一隻；市區內的電車公共汽車都給兒童以優待；而最有意義的是這一年中有一個兒童電影教育推行委員會的組織，在本市十家電影院中，每星期放映兒童電影一次；卽對窮苦兒童，也有流浪兒童工學團的設立，而且四四那天，他們也到大塲去舉行過盛大的集會，至於各商店的廉價發賣童裝，或贈送玩具，更是不可勝計。總之，各方而對於這未來的中國主人翁都會予以優待的。　　雖則各方面都曾予兒童以優待，但令人不痛快的事也還有。如果我們不是健忘的話，我們就該記得四月三日的晚報上有一則流浪兒因購衣不遂而將小棺材拋到店門的惡作劇新聞。從這一段新聞看來，我們知道那些看「教育電影」享受商店「優待」的兒童，假定要說是代表全體兒童的話，在這世界上，不！在這都會的一角，也還有窮得買不起衣穿的流浪兒，他們只能够向富家子討取一兩個銅元，或是在橋上替人拉車，得到極低微的賞賜，或是拾着一個蒲包，在太陽地裏奔跑，氣喘吁吁地喊「賣冰哦」，不過他們都「名不見報章」，所以住在高樓大厦裏的人，是不會知道的，卽使在路上遇見，也要隔上一道「林肯」，或者「斯蒂倍克」的玻窗，也就無關痛癢了。　　不過據某些人的看法，這些兒童，究竟還是少數，多數兒童不是都有適當的娛樂和教育麼？話是不錯的，他們都有學校讀書和看兒童電影的機會。但所謂兒童電影，却也够幽默，記得有幾家電影院輪流放映「荒江女俠」「怕難為情」這一類的戲，他們大概是希望這些兒童都能够入山求道，或者學學羅克的胡調女人。　　可憐中國的兒童，不是被某些人一腳踢出去，便是拿外面包着糖衣的毒藥給他們吃，在兒童年中，不見有人實際地去救救兒童，兒童年一過去，他們的命運，不是就更堪憂慮麽？　　不希望有空喊口號的儀式，只希望有埋頭苦幹的像流浪兒童工學團的多多產生，拯救兒童的責任是落在每一個有良心的靑年人身上，那些凑熱腦的，別有用心的，趁這兒童年開幕的時候做做好事，多休息一會兒吧！游泳  程修揚　　游泳這一門運動被注意起來還是近數年的事，成績之落後自然和出足風頭的足球比起來實在不可同日而語，卽是哄動全國的美人魚，相差世界紀錄還是很遠的。　　但是旣經被人注意起來，上海人就認為一種時髦的玩意兒了。據統計，上海的游泳池就有七八處之多，海濱浴塲不在內。每一個星期六和星期日的下午，游泳池常有人滿之患，大家坐右淺水的地方用脚背划着水，或者和對坐的人打水戰，有的穿上露背的新式游泳衣，拍儿張照，立的，坐的，各種姿勢都有；但是雪白的子臂，瘦削的大腿，總裝不像一個游泳家（不知有這末一個名稱否？）的樣子，於是有入稱之日「照片明星」，也是相當漂亮的。　　說起來是去年了，我也學過一次時髦，由許多朋友引導着到一個海濱浴塲去。海濱浴塲自然比較游泳池好，一望無際的火天一色，微風吹着，浪頭像魚鱗似的潑過來，假若有一尾美人魚乘風破浪而來，眞是天下之奇觀。游泳在我們鄉下呌做游水，游水我是頗有一點經騐的，現在要我穿上游泳衣，帶了那種橡皮的吹氣袋下水去，覺得太麻煩了。</p>

<p>那天來游泳的人很多，近海灘的地方都是一堆一堆的人，有的用手划着水，有的用脚划着水，水花飛起來也是很高的。帶着女朋友的，更高興彩烈，他們故意潛伏在水底，伸起手來拉住躺在橡皮袋上的小姐們的脚踝，橡皮袋一翻身，人就頭向下，腳向天沉到水里去了。拉脚的人果然高興，因為送了她下水，總得還要救她起來，在水底里自然有許多地方是比在水面上隨便一點的。那位小姐呢，大概驚嚇吃得不小，坐起身來後，一邊用手指梳着零亂的頭髮，一邊就伸起脚來去打那個人的頭顱，雙方面都佔到一點便宜，大家再想個花樣兒玩玩。舊小說上所謂「鴛鴦戲水」，大概就是那樣的景况了。上星期只有位朋友告訴我，他早上八點鐘到海濱浴塲，到午夜十二點鐘回來，我想沒有女朋友十六個鐘點要完全浸在水里，普通人總沒有這樣好水量的；但是他堅决聲明回去的是寫激間里一位同事，或許他們寫字間里沒有女職員也說不定。　　一拉又拉得太遠了。再說我入水之後，憑着在鄉下時候游水的經騐泳到救生船之外。我回頭向海灘望去，那些人頭像一個個西瓜似的搬來搬去，我正想再游出去的時候，救生船上的人用傳聲筒警告我了，沒有辦法，祇在四週兜了個圈子回來。和我同來的朋友已經在各處搜尋我了，我想他們或許懷疑我被海吞噬了也說不定，因為我游回來的時候，他們都露着驚訝之色。　　這樣，我沒有第二次再敢去游水，沒有女朋友當然是一個問題，不能像在鄉下時候那樣有興趣確是眞的。不是嗎？坐輪船，坐汽車，費了許多時間趕到海濱，祇是在海灘邊洗個浴，眞是太不值得了。　　在鄉下，祇要你高興，跑出屋子來就是河，你穿着衣服也好，光着身體也好，一個翻身就滾在河心里了。而且河里一天到晚有人在那里游水的，說得投機的時候，大家的了一個地方作目標，比賽了，常常十九個人一串，一條浪花貫連着向前游去。鄉下的女孩子也有那股蠻勁的，水像她們的家一樣，男孩子會幹什麽把戲，她們還會比我們玩得高興，然而沒有人敢拉拉她們的脚，或者想隨便一點。大家都是高興地玩，游水就是游水，沒有其他副作用的。　　今年沒有到過游泳池，游泳池的熱鬧情形恐怕更甚於往年吧？而且在報上讀得一條在游泳池泅斃的新聞，鄉下人聽了眞要笑痛肚子的。在前夜裏  吳廣鎮　　天惠大醫院裏，多了一位姑娘。她是有着微黑色團團的面孔，健康的體格，更富有鄉土氣息的姑娘。她呌倩子，專司病室的看護。　　倩子是有和氣的神氣，愛說話，沒開口，就先笑。在二十四小時裏，她就靈敏地認熟了院內的一切伴夥。帶近視鏡的，是調劑師茜茹，個兒的細商診療室的注射助手是玫林，和她自己同職務，而且還住在一齋，琳文·嫻琴·艾麗……一些倩子早日羨慕着的！白衣天使們。倩子為了初來，為了早日就羨慕她們，對她們很要好。可是，她郤看不慣那：人工造成的橙色臉頰，腥紅的嘴唇，以及那聖潔的天使衣裏襯的華麗而更有妖艷色　的衣服。　　在這　的環境中，倩子的鄉士氣味，是很別緻的；很招人愛，同伴就多愛向她逗着玩。　　『倩了，我來給你燙髮吧！』　　『倩子我給你抹點胭脂，瞧，你的嘴唇象患貧血症的！』　　這種話使得倩子臉紅，自然地說了：『俺不！』　　『俺不！』　　『俺不　』　　大家學着，作着鬼臉，笑。笑，日子，就是這樣跟着笑聲走了。　　過着看護病人的子，倩子不再那樣愛笑了。鄉土氣儘管是鄉土氣，郤失掉了那憨掬可愛，而臉上是張着了懷疑，憂鬱的網。她的心是受了創傷。夜裏，直到這繁華的都市陷入了死般的寂靜，倩子還沒得入夢呢！她呆望周圍在酣睡的同伴，牆上掛着一件件的白衣，苦惱地在想。　　她，一個不懂世故的孩子，算起來只有十七歲，踏到社會層裏來，看到的一切，跟她那純潔的腦海中所想到的多麽不同啊！　　白天，那個淋病症患者，本無須住院而甘願住院的油滑人，和來探望他的人的對話，是針般刺傷了倩子的心。倩子是看護着他的。那幅圖畫現在淸晰地現在她的記憶裏：　　「老張，你又不要緊，住醫院要幹啥？醫院多拘束的荒！」　　患者聽了，大聲地笑了，說：「拘束？去你的吧！阿木林，住院有住院的好處！早晨你瞧吧，捧洗臉水的，端點心的，嘿，滿是些小白蝴蝶兒！」　　「喝！為這呵！倒怪新鮮，住院為的看看護。這可能幹啥呢！」　　「能幹啥！嘿，有錢買的鬼上樹！一樣的幹……」（未完）播音特別節目　　稚鳴社　　交通（一三〇〇）下午五時三刻至六時半　　愛的花　（冰卿）　　太平洋　（沈玲）　　航空救國　（陳萍）　　銀漢雙星　（沈瑛）　　空中音樂　（冰卿）　　恭賀新禧　（沈玲）　　兄弟行　（柴瑟）　　安眠　（沈瑛）彈詞　　錢景章錢醉仙毛家書　　中西（一〇四〇）上午十時至十時三刻　　開篇「關壽峯酒樓索隱」　　風塵厄困老英雄。正是。白髮蒼頭的關壽峯。只見那，兵士護從摩托至。不圖是，女兒赫赫返家中。那秀姑是，笑盈盈雙手提包進。就把那，曲折情由細訴衷。壽峯是，耳　暗中心樂意。正不愧，黃杉俠客美髯公。秀姑是，雄糾糾。好威風。竟比從前大不同。他只為，同院鄰家來告別。說道我，終身有託繫絲紅。今日是，出門惘惘離京去。故而是，不待言辭別太忽。那一般，鄰院一見都驚異。並羨他，身入雲霄步九重。待見那，目送姑娘車已遠。壽峯是。從容含笑喜融融。我正是，心中捨不得姑娘去。只因為，路遠雲山萬里峯。正不知，欲待何時重覿面。故而要，驛亭目斷送飛鴻。雖然是，與君家早夕盤桓久。我只好，勞燕東西作別儂。就將那，銀欵布包分付託。此行盡在不言中。再說那，樊家公子與老年翁。到今朝酒樓相的同為伴。無非是，暫別君顏話舊踪。好得我，浪跡天涯誰與侶。只與那，女兒奔走慣西東。今日是，勸君更盡一杯酒。只為那，一病成痴的女美容。你終要，舊事休提她憶在胸。　　何芸芳何琴芳雙珠球　　麟記（一二二〇）下午二時一刻至三時　　開篇「賈賣玉夜探瀟湘館」　　隆冬寒露結成冰。月色迷濛欲斷魂。一陣陣的朔風透入骨。烏洞洞的大觀園裏冷淸淸。寶玉是一路在花街走。夜闌人靜不聞聲。他是一盞燈。一個人。黑影幢幢向前行。孤單單獨自到瀟湘館。去看看林妹妹病體可减輕。輕敲銅環滴搭響。可有人快些來開門。紫鵑聽，問一聲，可是寶二爺欲向裏邊行。一手忙將門開放。請仔細了深宵的寒冷不留情。多謝你姊姊心關切。我是沒齒難忘感大恩。多只為放心不下你們林姑娘。故而是夜靜更深到來臨。行來已到病榻邊。見他是氣喘噓噓兩淚淋。一個兒呌林妹妹。一個兒把表兄稱。杏眼微睜看不淸。表兄呀，你家二嫂嫂待我太刻薄。他言語荒蕩把是非生。老祖宗雖然心愛我。可憐我，不能前去請安甯。我與你，前世的孽債今世了。請不必，再看我這薄命人。妹妹呀，你的一切煩惱多丟開。不可自己太看輕。我勸你，一日三餐多飲食。衣衫宜添保體溫。我勸你，夜來早睡莫太遲。湯藥補劑要多飲。我勸你，姊妹的言語聽不得。他們是，似假似戲又似眞。我勸你，養身養心自保重。再不可，想起揚州的舊門庭。聞言語。淚淋淋。冤家為奴最傷心。表兄呀，請早回轉怡紅院。</p>

<h3>He Yingqin Hosts Banquet for Guangdong Air Force Personnel. Air Force Personnel Visited Mausoleum Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin held a banquet at 7 p.m. on the 30th at the Lizi Society to welcome the Guangdong Air Force personnel who came north. During the banquet, Minister He gave a speech of welcome, which is recorded verbatim below. Fellow comrades, I am very happy to be able to meet you here today. What I consider fortunate is not because we have been separated by thousands of miles, and can now gather together and shake hands, but because during this Guangdong-Guangxi Incident, you were all able to overcome difficulties, escape the dark and chaotic environment, resolutely come to the Central Government, support national unification, obey government orders, and set an example for the world. This pure spirit, noble character, and upright and bright actions are not only a model for our Air Force personnel, but also a model for our national military personnel. This is what I personally consider very fortunate. In recent years, most of our country's military personnel have made great progress in their thinking, academic skills, and technology, but there are also a very small number of people who still think that the army is a personal tool, the more soldiers they have, the bigger their ambitions. When personal desires overcome reason, they disregard everything, act rashly, use the country as a gamble, treat the lives of the people like goose feathers, and sacrifice the rights and happiness of the majority in exchange for personal glory and wealth. If this kind of thinking and action is not fundamentally broken, then even if the majority of people work hard and struggle, the result will be equal to zero. This time, the comrades of the Air Force were the first to break the concept of region and people, recognize the environment the country is in, and know that the Air Force is a part of the national army, and should do their best to cultivate and protect it, and reserve it for the country's future command. They cannot listen to the instructions of any individual to do things that harm the country and the people. Their clear understanding, agile actions, and great spirit are enough to make the few unscrupulous military personnel in the country tremble with fear, unable to continue their wrong actions, and dare not continue their wrong actions. Today, the air forces of various countries in the world are developing rapidly, and there is a tendency to advance a thousand miles in a day. Our country's air force is still in its infancy. Compared with the major powers, we are far behind. However, with the spirit of loyalty to the country, comrades, under the unified organization, training, and command of the Central Government, we will strive to improve and innovate day by day. In three to five years, we will be able to catch up, track the major powers, and enrich national defense. This is what I hope to share with you after today's banquet. Comrades have come from afar, and it is also the hot summer weather. The long journey has been laborious. I would like to raise a glass of wine to fulfill the friendship of the host, and wish you all the best in your efforts for the country and your physical and mental health.

<h3>Chiang Summons Huang Musong and Others, Instructing on Steps for Guangdong's Administration, Absolutely Prohibiting Opium and Gambling. Huang and Others Will Go to Xun to Return to Nanjing to Handle Turnover</h3>
<p>(Jiujiang) From Guling by telephone: Chairman Chiang summoned Guangdong Provincial Chairman Huang Musong, Secretary-General Cen Xuelu, Director of Construction Liu Weizhi, and Guangzhou Mayor Zeng Yangfu in the afternoon of the 30th to give instructions on the Guangdong government. It is heard that Chairman Chiang deeply hates the opium and gambling in Guangdong and personally instructed Huang Musong to find ways to prohibit them after taking office. Huang decided to go to Xun on the morning of the 31st to return to Nanjing because the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission is urgently awaiting handover. Cen Xuelu and Secretary Zhu Shouyu and others will accompany him. In addition, Liu Weizhi is scheduled to go to Nanjing on the morning of the 31st to handle the handover. It is heard that after Huang, Liu, and others have finished their affairs in Nanjing, they can go to Guangdong together in mid-September to take office.

<p>(Nanjing) Huang Musong is still staying in Guling and needs to meet with President Chiang to ask for instructions on Guangdong's administrative policies.

The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission is currently rushing to handle the handover matters. According to Zhao Pilian to reporters, there is no definite news on when the newly appointed Chairman Lin Yunjai will come to Nanjing. According to reports, Lin will go north after the Guangdong Provincial Government is handed over. I sincerely hope that Chairman Lin can come to Nanjing as soon as possible to preside over everything so that the Commission's affairs can be followed. In addition, the newly appointed Guangdong Provincial Committee member and Director of Construction Liu Weizhi will also return to Nanjing within days from Lushan to handle the handover and then go to Guangdong to take office.

The province's annual flood prevention fee for the Yellow River is 118,000 yuan, and the province has allocated 80,000 yuan. The Yongding River is 60,000 yuan, and the central government has allocated it. The four rivers of the North and South Canal, Ziya, and Daqing have a total flood prevention fee of 150,000 yuan and have never had special funds. They only rely on donations from river workers, but they are still insufficient. He is currently requesting President Song to approve and allocate funds. All construction, whether beneficial or harmful, must be done. However, river management is absolute. If it is not managed, disasters are unavoidable. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Judicial Yuan Interprets Two Ambiguities</h3>

If a foreigner who enjoys consular jurisdiction applies to a Chinese court for a provisional attachment of the property of the debtor, and a Chinese person who has a mortgage right on the property files a lawsuit with the same court to confirm the mortgage right, it is different from a lawsuit against the execution objection. It is sufficient to take only the debtor as the defendant to provide relief, without taking the foreigner as the defendant. (30th Central News Agency Electric Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Expectations for the Shanghai Municipal Hospital</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Hospital, which the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau was ordered to organize, has been actively preparing since its planning stages. It is said that the construction of the building is nearing completion, and the interior arrangement is currently underway. It is expected to open around Double Ten Day this year. The Shanghai Hospital and the Infectious Disease Hospital, which are already under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Health Bureau, will be joined by this newly established organization, forming a tripartite force. From now on, they will advance hand in hand, benefiting the people and relieving their suffering, which will be more than just a small contribution. Among all the municipal facilities, this initiative is undoubtedly the most suitable for the actual needs of the citizens. How can we not express our full enthusiasm to celebrate the implementation of this grand plan?</p>
<p>Given Shanghai's important strategic position, dense population, convenient access to medicines and therapeutic tools, and the abundance of reputable doctors and expert clinics, the overall health situation is naturally better than in the interior. However, even in poor families, seeking medical treatment is still difficult. When afflicted by illness, they often hesitate to seek help. Private doctors usually charge high consultation fees, while public hospitals often lack the kind of attentive service one would hope for. Thus, there are leisurely and comfortable doctors on one side, and sick people crying out for help with no way to access it on the other. Society inevitably displays its contradictions, and this phenomenon is especially pronounced in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The purpose of establishing public hospitals is to provide universal relief. However, in a metropolis of three million people, there are only about ten hospitals of a reasonable scale. It is inevitable that they cannot fully fulfill the responsibility of broad and universal love. I have often seen large groups of sick and miserable people, with furrowed brows and sorrowful faces, wandering and moaning at the gates of the hospital. When asked why they were hesitating and not proceeding forward, some were turned away because they were late for their appointments, others were rejected because the registration was full, and some even had to travel in vain due to mismatches in the examination department. Hospitals have their rules, but ordinary people often do not fully understand them. Being afflicted with illness is already extremely painful, and to encounter such unexpected setbacks is even more pitiable. Moreover, even if these poor and sick people have managed to register and enter the examination room, it is still questionable whether the doctor will be willing to provide careful treatment without being careless, or whether the nurse will be willing to provide gentle guidance without being harsh. All of these are common phenomena in general public hospitals, and they urgently need practical improvement.</p>
<p>I believe that the main conditions for public hospitals are: adequate financial support, sufficient equipment and supplies, and, most importantly, a satisfactory and reasonable personnel management system. Internal medicine and surgery should be available for consultations every day. Doctors may take turns working shifts. Doctors should focus on the pathology of the disease and never judge patients based on their identity. In addition, how to evaluate the attendance of doctors and how to train nurses are all indispensable steps. I sincerely hope that the newly established Shanghai Municipal Hospital can set a good example for general public hospitals.</p>

<h3>Britain, America and Japan Prepare to Race to Build Battleships; Britain Builds Two Ships and America Does Not Want to Be Left Behind; Japan's Economy Can Barely Maintain Military Preparations</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Naval Ministry's Bureau of Supplies is currently rushing to prepare the budget for the next fiscal year, and will submit it to the Ministry of Finance along with the Navy's new national defense plan before August 10th. The Navy's first and second supplementary plans were drawn up within the limits stipulated by the treaties, but this time the Navy's plan is completely free, realizing the construction of battleships and other types of ships, and its purpose is to counter the British and American navies five years later, and to control the sea power of the Western Pacific, in order to ensure national defense. Therefore, although the authorities are implementing economic military preparations, they inevitably need huge funds. (Domei News, 30th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Acting Secretary of the Navy, Admiral Stanley, told a newspaper interviewer today that the US government will definitely build two battleships next year. The actual decision to start construction will depend on whether the United Kingdom and other countries have indeed started building new ships. It is reported that Mr. Stanley's remarks were published at the same time as British Navy Secretary Hall announced in the House of Commons that the British government would build two battleships next time. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) At today's meeting of the House of Commons, some members asked the government questions on various issues, which were answered by various cabinet members. The questions and answers are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Conservative MP Captain MacDonald Peter asked the government: "It is rumored that the Japanese government plans to build several battleships with a gun caliber of 18 inches (the current caliber limit is 16 inches). Has the government received any reports?" Navy Minister Sir Hall replied: "I have seen this news in the newspapers, but apart from that, I have not received any information to confirm it, which shows that the rumors are not entirely credible." Conservative MP Sir Davidson asked the government about Germany's construction of fortifications on Heligoland Island in the North Sea. Foreign Secretary Eden replied: "Germany's establishment of defense on the island is purely a unilateral action. If this issue is carefully studied, the British government should raise a reservation to Germany. However, various countries are currently conducting negotiations to seek a comprehensive solution to the European situation. It does not seem appropriate to raise this issue at this time." Air Undersecretary Sassoon made a statement on the recent aviation agreement between Italy and Germany, saying that this agreement stipulates the opening of regular air routes between the two countries, and Italy will provide Germany with the use of airports on the Italian Aegean islands.

<h3>Anglo-Russian Rapprochement; Loan of Ten Million Pounds Agreed; Naval Treaty Also Agreed</h3>
<p>(London) The news about the establishment of a commercial loan agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union (a total loan of 10 million pounds) to develop British trade with Russia was first published by this agency. British officials have recently confirmed it. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) Britain and the Soviet Union yesterday concluded a draft agreement on commercial loans. The government has recently submitted this draft to the House of Commons for discussion. Trade Minister Runciman will also attend the House of Commons today to explain it. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) An agreement on British credit extension to Soviet Russia was concluded today. It stipulates that Soviet Russia will order goods worth 10 million pounds from Britain within 15 months. The British Export Credits Guarantee Department will devise methods so that the British and Russian sides can quickly pay the goods to the exporters. This news was announced by Commercial Minister Rensiman in the House of Commons today. It is said that the Soviet government will issue convertible bonds with a 5.5% interest rate for a period of five years. Rensiman also said that under this agreement, the goods ordered by Soviet Russia do not include military supplies. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) The British government has recently decided to lend a commercial loan to the Soviet Union so that it can use it to purchase goods from Britain. The loan amount is set at 10 million pounds, with a term of ten years and an annual interest rate of 5.5%. This matter is now scheduled to be officially announced tomorrow. The Soviet government will immediately draft a plan so that it can order goods from British factories in the next twelve months. According to British business people, in view of the sharp reduction in German trade with Russia compared to the past, since January of this year, they have advocated granting the Soviet Union the convenience of purchasing goods, so as to take advantage of the opportunity to promote British export trade. Britain and Russia then began negotiations at that time, and finally succeeded recently. Political figures believe that the conclusion of the loan is a sign of political rapprochement between Britain and Russia. Regarding this loan, people in the stock exchange said that the domestic trade situation has been sluggish and depressed recently, and it is urgent to promote export commerce to make up for it, so the establishment of the loan is indeed justified. People in the banking industry advocate that part of the loan should be used to clear the old debts owed to Britain during the Tsarist Russian era. Soviet personnel here said that the People's Commissar for Foreign Trade of that country, Rosenholz, recently issued a declaration on the new foreign trade policy, stating that foreign loans that do not meet the following conditions should be rejected: (A) the creditor is a private company, (B) the annual interest rate is above 6%, and (C) the term is less than five years. The terms of this loan are in line with this policy. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) Since the naval talks between Britain and Russia began in May of this year, a draft agreement has recently been concluded and will be signed soon. The British government has recently notified the signatory countries of the Washington Naval Treaty (namely the United States, France, Italy, and Japan) and Germany and Poland separately of the content of the draft. The main points are: (1) a method for mutually notifying the order of shipbuilding between the two countries, and (2) various qualitative restriction methods, with the most important being that the tonnage of battleships should not exceed 35,000 tons. After the Anglo-Russian naval agreement is concluded, not only can the naval talks between Britain and Germany be accelerated (Germany is waiting for the Anglo-Russian agreement to be concluded before proceeding with talks with Britain), but also the talks between Britain and Poland can be started more easily. After this, it will be easier for Italy to sign and join the London Naval Treaty signed by Britain, France, and the United States. (Havas, 30th)</p>

<h3>British King's Mediterranean Cruise: Departure within Ten Days, Returning in Three to Four Weeks</h3>
<p>(London) King Edward VIII has decided to embark on the yacht "Dubrovnik," provided by Lady Yule, on August 8th, for a cruise in the eastern Mediterranean, near the Yugoslav coast, as a summer retreat. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) King Edward VIII has announced the cancellation of his vacation plans to the Riviera and will instead embark on a sea cruise. He has accepted Lady Yule's offer to use her motor yacht "Nahlin" for the trip. The departure is scheduled within ten days, and the return will be in three to four weeks. It is said that this cruise will take place along the Dalmatian coast and various parts of the eastern Mediterranean. He will first travel overland to Dalmatia, possibly with a segment by airplane. From there, he will board the "Nahlin" yacht. The yacht is scheduled to set sail from Southampton within the next day or two, heading to Dalmatia to await the King's arrival. The reason for using the "Nahlin" yacht is that the royal yachts "Victoria" and "Albert" are too large to navigate the small bays along the Dalmatian coast. He will make several landings along the way, with British destroyers providing escort as is customary. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Malta: Admiral Sir Dudley Pound, Commander-in-Chief of the British Mediterranean Fleet, departed this morning aboard the cruiser "Galatea" for Spain.

<h3>French Border Fortifications: Socialist Party Survey Satisfied, Proposes Reducing Military Service</h3>
<p>(Paris) The term of national conscription has been one year. In March of last year, the Senate and Chamber of Deputies passed a law extending it to two years. The Socialist Party has objected to this system. Recently, they dispatched representatives to the eastern border to investigate the progress of the defensive fortifications. The results were satisfactory. The party's deputies are now planning to propose a reduction in the term of military service. During the afternoon session of the Chamber of Deputies' Army Committee today, Socialist Deputy Lassalle stated that the eastern border fortifications are nearing completion. The party caucus is currently drafting a proposal to shorten the term of military service once these fortifications are completed. He stated that strengthening national defense involves either increasing the number of troops or improving armaments, and both are not necessarily required simultaneously. He favored the latter. Currently, simply redeploying troops stationed throughout the country to the vicinity of the border would be sufficient to defend the territory with a one-year conscription system. Deputy Choffe seconded the proposal. However, Communist Deputy Gouneau dissented. Former Secretary-General of the State Council, Reynaud, stated that reducing the term of military service at this time would not be acceptable to Minister of War Daladier. (Havas, 29th)</p>

<h3>Spanish Civil War: International Relations Deepen, Britain, France, Germany and Italy Take Different Stances, Tangier Issue Causes Disputes</h3>
<p>Madrid: The tension and terror between the left-wing government of Spain and the Fascists and right-wing elements have not subsided. According to recent news, it is still impossible to determine who will ultimately prevail. Although the government still holds several provinces, the rebels also control several provinces. The fate of Madrid, Barcelona, and several other major cities remains uncertain. Government troops and rebel forces are currently stalemated on the Guadarrama mountain front, about thirty miles north of Madrid. Although the past two days have been relatively quiet, the rebels began shelling government forces today in retaliation for yesterday's aerial attacks by government forces. The rebels are now receiving supplies of arms, but the rebel forces in that area are still inferior to government forces in terms of numbers and strength. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Tetouan, Morocco: Rebel leader General Franco told a Reuters correspondent at his headquarters here yesterday that his goal is to eliminate the Communists.

(Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Tangier: The International Administration Committee here has decided that the countries involved should send naval officers to organize a committee to guard the port and international zone. The International Committee believes that the presence of Spanish government warships in Tangier has provoked protests from the rebels and will incite war in the Tangier region, inevitably threatening good relations between Britain, Germany, Italy, and Spain. The four countries had previously jointly organized the government in Tangier. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>The international neutral port of Tangier in North Africa is only a short distance from Spanish Morocco. Several Spanish warships are currently stationed in the port, intending to launch attacks on rebels in Morocco from there. The International Committee of the neutral zone and the British and French governments have made representations to the Spanish government, requesting that it not use the port as a base for suppressing the Moroccan rebels. As of now, these warships remain in port and show no sign of being moved elsewhere. According to this agency's diplomatic correspondent, the British, French, and Italian governments are currently exchanging views on this matter. Italy, because it has interests in the port of Tangier and has expressed sympathy for the Spanish rebels, is extremely concerned about the negotiations currently being conducted by the three governments.

<p>(Rome) Regarding the Spanish civil war, official circles in Italy have stated that they will remain neutral. However, political figures largely openly sympathize with the Spanish rebels. Diplomatic circles say that the Spanish civil war proves that European countries are increasingly divided into two major camps: Fascist and anti-Fascist, and that the compromise efforts currently underway may be hampered by this, causing considerable unease.

<h3>Northern Front Battles: Government Forces Have Upper Hand</h3>
<p>Hendaye, France: According to news from Spain, government forces have the upper hand today. San Sebastián has been completely recaptured, a major setback for the rebels. With the loss of this city, the rebels no longer have any hope of controlling Guipúzcoa province. The rebels have retreated to the village of Oyarzun. All roads north of the village, which had been in rebel hands for the past two days, have now been completely abandoned. They will wait for reinforcements from Pamplona before attempting a counterattack. On the government side, after recapturing San Sebastián, they are currently consolidating their positions. The government forces in that area can now rest easy. In addition, after the surrender of the rebels in Lodosa a few days ago, a large number of weapons and ammunition stored there are now in the possession of the government forces. The government forces, strengthened by this influx of supplies, are gaining momentum. Currently, government forces are reorganizing the provincial government in San Sebastián, establishing civil affairs, finance, and military departments, and actively handling local post-war reconstruction. In addition, it is rumored that the city of Tolosa in southern Guipúzcoa province has also been recovered. (Havas, 30th)</p>

<p>Rebel Front in the North: Forty thousand rebels and an even larger number of government troops fought to the death today near the Pola de Gordón valley, which is Madrid's defensive line. Five government aircraft attempted to destroy a bridge to cut off rebel communications, killing one rebel and wounding thirty, but two of the aircraft were also shot down by the rebels. A rebel aircraft was also forced to land. Although bullets rained down, the occupants of the aircraft were unharmed. Rebel staff officers announced today that the Revolutionary Army is far better equipped than the government forces. Generals Franco and Mola will soon launch a full-scale attack on Madrid to decide the victory, but the government forces are more mobile due to having more vehicles. (National News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>Hendaye, France: There was no decisive battle between Spanish government troops and rebel forces as of last night.

<h3>A Record of the Successful Reclamation of Xishanping in Beibei, Sichuan</h3>
<p>— Pan Xuehai</p>
<p>The hot springs of Beibei in Ba County are visited and bathed in by almost everyone who has been to Sichuan. Across the Jialing River is a mountain range called Xishanping. Thirty *li* further into the mountains along this range lies the Xishanping No. 2 Farm of the Western China Civil Service Academy. This farm is worth discussing because it was once completely "virgin wasteland," perhaps never before cultivated. At least, no traces of previous cultivation can be found. Now, it has become a fertile expanse, considered a success. Not only does the farm itself have effective methods, but the surrounding farmers, who previously struggled to survive, have also received considerable assistance, ending their cries of hunger and cold. According to statistics from 1932, only 27% of China's land is arable, and only 7% is cultivated, leaving 20% as wasteland. This is an alarming figure. Therefore, the methods implemented at Xishanping, where land reclamation has been successful, are worth presenting as a reference:</p>
<p>Initially Considered Impossible</p>
<p>The original appearance of this farm, from a distance, was simply a "bald hill." Upon entering, one saw only short trees, small bamboo, ferns, and tribulus plants. Digging away these primitive plants with hoes revealed that the entire land was interwoven with bamboo and tree roots, with no open soil larger than a square foot. Mr. Lu Erqin (younger brother of Mr. Lu Zuofu) was the one who initially advocated for reclaiming this vast wasteland. He spent over two thousand silver dollars on this sparsely inhabited, barren plateau, building a new Chinese-style bungalow with more than twenty rooms, along with some attached thatched houses. Although the house was built, many people thought it was impossible to cultivate the land. Only a small number believed that since eight or nine tenths of the mountain was soil, with only one or two tenths being rock, by "concentrating labor," one could simply remove the primitive plants, break up the soil, and sow seeds, which would surely lead to growth and success.</p>
<p>Trial Planting of Watermelons Proves Success</p>
<p>Since many people did not approve, no one invested. Therefore, initially, only officials and soldiers of the Gorges Defense Bureau used their spare time to go up the mountain and cultivate the land using military labor. After a long period, seventy *mu* were cleared. Watermelons were first tried in the year before last, and large-scale planting began last year. Previously, watermelons were only produced in Kuimen and outside Chongqing, and Sichuan did not have this fruit. The person in charge believed that Xishanping, being a plateau with dry soil, was suitable for growing watermelons. Therefore, many watermelon seeds were brought from outside the province. For "Sanbai" watermelons, there were Pinghu, Shandong, and Lingyuan varieties. For "Maling" watermelons, there were Xinfeng, Jiaxing, and Pinghu varieties. There were also Shandong Red, Nanjing Red, Sanhua, Sanyi, Dezhou, Malei, and Jinmi watermelons. The sources included provinces and cities such as Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. Furthermore, a specialist watermelon grower was hired from Dezhou. As a result, the watermelons planted last year were harvested, earning over two thousand silver dollars, which proved the initial success of the farm's land reclamation.</p>
<p>Contracting and Fertilizing Methods</p>
<p>Last year, only seventy *mu* were reclaimed. This year, over two hundred *mu* were reclaimed for planting watermelons. If all the harvests can be sold without oversupply, a profit of around seven thousand yuan can be guaranteed. The reclamation method involved hiring nearby farmers on contract since military reclamation lacked sufficient manpower. In areas with fewer short trees and small bamboo, the agreed price was three silver dollars per *mu*. In denser areas, it was four silver dollars per *mu*. The dug-up tree roots were used to make charcoal, thicker branches for firewood, and larger trunks for timber (rare). The remaining thin branches, grass, and bamboo were burned into ash for fertilizer. There was virtually no waste. The above was considered "rough clearing," after which careful tilling was needed before planting crops. Regarding fertilizer, a large round manure pit was newly built in a suitable location on the farm, with a square water pool behind it and an ash house in front. The fertilizer sources now include large flocks of sheep, tended by a specialist shepherd, as well as pigs and cattle. Therefore, fertilizer no longer needs to be bought and transported from the foot of the mountain, saving money and generating production.</p>
<p>Water Conservancy Solves Drought Problems</p>
<p>The most important issue for the farm is water conservancy. Being a "ping" (plateau), it is higher than the average plain. In case of floods, all rainwater would flow downhill into the rivers of the plain. In case of drought, all crops on the mountain would have nowhere to hide and would wither. The farm fears drought more than floods, so the question of whether water conservancy is feasible is a matter of life and death for the farm. Therefore, the farm followed the natural watercourses and built a long dam in the depressions of the terrain, forming a pond. Three such ponds have already been built. Many small ditches have also been dug to various locations. The clear channel network of the farm's water conservancy has thus been successfully excavated. Furthermore, the farm faces east and is backed by higher mountains. All the water sources come from the higher mountains. Therefore, behind the farm, there is a larger depression with two water sources converging. The surrounding area is all rock. By sealing the two small gaps with mud and stone, a large rectangular lake would become a general reservoir. If this general reservoir is completed, not only the entire farm but also all the farmers on the mountain would no longer fear drought and could benefit from irrigation.</p>
<p>Improving Farmers' Lives</p>
<p>Last summer, the entire Xishanping suffered from drought, but because the farm had dug ponds early, it still had a harvest while nearby farmers had none. Therefore, the farmers helped the farm carry watermelons down the mountain and clear land (as mentioned above), earning a living. Furthermore, the farm also hired nearby farmers to help raise Italian chickens. When the chickens were first given out, they had a fixed value, but no cash was required upfront. Italian chickens can lay over two hundred eggs each year. After laying the eggs, they are gradually handed over to the farm to pay for the chickens at a reasonable price, the egg price is the same as the general market price. Once the chickens are paid off, the Italian chickens become the property of the farmers, and the eggs they lay afterward are sold to the farm at the market price, becoming a new and regular income for the farmers. Furthermore, farmers can raise either male or female Italian chickens. However, if raising native chickens, only hens are allowed, not roosters, to prevent the breed from deteriorating. The farm buys back these eggs and incubates them, gradually expanding the program as described above. In addition, farmers are hired to raise Berkshire pigs, Longchang pigs, and northern sheep, with similar methods, aiming to develop sideline occupations for nearby farm households and gradually improve their lives.</p>
<p>(Conclusion) Furthermore, the farm also encourages farmers to pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene, taking a bath once a week (in hot weather, bathing takes place in the pond in front of the morning market, as the pond's water is kept clean and serves as a swimming pool). The farm also inspects their homes for cleanliness once a week and gradually breaks down rural superstitions, as well as promotes thrift in funeral and wedding expenses. Because farmers have received real benefits in their lives, they readily accept these requests from the farm. Finally, how much capital was spent on operating this farm? Strictly speaking, only the two thousand silver dollars spent on building the house. Although there are over three thousand *mu* of land reclaimed on the entire mountain, the annual rent is only ten yuan. Readers may not believe it, but it is indeed the case. The fundamental reason is that in the past, many people considered it useless wasteland. Unexpectedly, military reclamation proved successful, so Mr. Lu Zuofu had fourteen large characters written on the lime-plastered walls on either side of the farm's main gate: "Raise the hoe to open up the earth, lead the troops to attack nature."</p>

<h3>The Situation in Guangxi Province Deteriorates Again; Military Movements in Nanning and Longzhou; Strict Inspection of Incoming Passengers in Wuzhou</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the change in the Guangdong situation, Li Zongren immediately left Guangdong and returned to Guangxi. The Guangxi military's office in Guangdong has also been closed. Li and Bai Chongxi originally intended to assume the positions of chief and deputy director of the Guangxi Pacification Headquarters, respectively, in accordance with the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, in the hope of temporarily preserving the vitality of Guangxi Province. However, after the recent orders from the Central Government appointing Li as a standing member of the Military Affairs Commission and Bai as chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government were announced, Li and Bai suddenly changed their attitude, and the situation in Guangxi Province has once again become tense. Yesterday, Li Pinxian and Zhang Renmin, representatives of Guangxi, came to Guangzhou to discuss peaceful solutions with Yu Hanmou and Chen Cheng, but unexpectedly, they hurriedly returned to Guangxi on the 26th. The glimmer of hope for peace in Guangxi has thus been extinguished. It is now known that Nanning, Liuzhou, Guilin, Pingle, and Longzhou are constructing defensive fortifications day and night. The mobilization of the entire province's militia is unusually busy, and the collection of military rice is also being actively carried out. Furthermore, prices are soaring, and finance is tight. Rumors are rampant in Nanning and Wuzhou, and business has come to a standstill. Imports and exports have almost disappeared. Merchants leaving Wuzhou to seek temporary refuge in Guangdong are becoming increasingly crowded. Guangxi currency has plummeted, with every hundred yuan worth only fifty yuan in Guangdong currency. In order to prevent spies from entering the country, spreading rumors, and causing trouble, the headquarters of the Fourth Army Group has telegraphed orders to the militia in each district to strictly guard against them. After receiving the order, local authorities have strictly implemented it. Yesterday, a man named Tang was arrested in Wuzhou and immediately executed by shooting. The authorities have also tightened martial law in Wuzhou, as it is the gateway to Guangxi Province. In addition to strictly inspecting travelers, they are also banning ferries and rafts from accommodating overnight guests. The Wuzhou Public Security Bureau has issued a notice to inform everyone, stating: "According to a report from the Water Police Sub-bureau, after investigation, the ferries operating on the Fu and Da Rivers within the sub-bureau's jurisdiction are frequent, and the brothels and entertainment establishments in the special zone are densely populated. These ferries and brothel rafts have been accommodating merchants without reporting to the bureau, making inspection difficult. Other boaters and households are originally required to report to the bureau when accommodating overnight guests, but over time, this has become lax, and there are instances of concealment and failure to report. In these extraordinary times, it is difficult to guarantee that there are no petty thieves and criminals taking advantage of the situation to lie in wait, hoping to avoid military and police scrutiny in order to disrupt local order. The harm is not insignificant. In order to prevent problems before they arise, it is proposed to issue a notice to all ferries, brothels, and other boaters and households that if they accommodate overnight guests in the future, regardless of the length of stay, the responsible person or householder must truthfully list the guest's name, age, original address, place of origin, and length of stay and report it to the sub-bureau or the local police station for verification at any time to eliminate loopholes and prevent hidden dangers," etc. (July 29)</p>
<h3>Xiamen's Usurious Loans: The Exploitation Methods of Taiwanese People are Horrifying; The Government Has Now Established a Loan Office to Provide Relief</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: A large number of Taiwanese people residing in Xiamen are engaged in usury. Relying on their special background, they are not subject to the laws of our government, and with the increasing decline of industry and commerce, their business has flourished. Many are like drinking poison to quench their thirst. Their usury operations are divided into two types: (1) pawnshops, (2) "day interest" (i.e., exorbitant interest). The former involves pawned items, while the latter involves lending money. Most of those engaged in these activities are Taiwanese. There are more than forty shops in the city, all displaying the signboard "So-and-so Foreign Firm." Chinese law stipulates a maximum interest rate of two percent per month. In Xiamen's pawnshops, the monthly interest is twenty percent, with two *jiao* of interest charged per yuan per month. The pawn period is two months, making the interest rate ten times higher than legally permitted. The value of pawned items is generally only one-tenth of their original price. With high interest and short terms, those who pawn items are mostly common people or the very poor who cannot afford to redeem them. At the same time, there are many second-hand clothing stores and used goods stores, most of which are also run by Taiwanese. They either operate pawnshops concurrently or take over the pawned items after the pawn period expires. The pawnshops and used goods stores, with their background, dare to accept items from any source, thus becoming the sole outlet for stolen goods. The wind of theft and robbery in Xiamen is thus intensified. Those who have nothing to pawn borrow at "day interest." The lenders are mostly local bullies or gang leaders, and their exploitation is even more horrific. For example, if someone borrows ten yuan, they deduct 1.5 yuan in interest first, so only 8.5 yuan is actually paid out. Starting the day after the loan, they have to repay 0.25 yuan every day, and in fourty days the debt is cleared. The most cruel situation is that if a yuan is not paid in four days, the borrower is fined ten times the amount (ten yuan) and it's added to the principal. There are cases where even after tens of yuan are paid back, the borrower is still not clear, and those where they paid 100 to 200 but weren't able to pay off a principal amount of 10 to 20. The borrowers are mostly poor people who borrow to use as capital for petty vendors. Due to the pressure of family life, they are often unable to repay on time and become long-term slaves to the "day interest" lenders. The creditors all have evil forces and backgrounds. The debtors cannot escape and cannot default. In Xiamen, there are frequent cases of privately abducting people, imprisoning them, and beating them, which are the "day interest" lenders exercising their authority to demand payment. This usury, which exploits the poor, is extremely harmful to society and, along with pawnshops, can be called the twin poisons of Xiamen. Because of the special relationships, it is not easy to remove them. Recently, the provincial government ordered all counties to establish "Civilian Loan Offices." The Xiamen Municipal Government has drafted measures and submitted them to the provincial government for approval. The Finance Bureau has convened the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce and various banks to discuss the matter, and it can be established soon. This is to provide relief to the common people who are being exploited by "day interest." The main points of the measures are: (1) The office will borrow 5,000 yuan from banks and handle it at the lowest interest rate. (2) Those who contract to operate branches must be citizens of the Republic of China and provide two reliable guarantors with capital exceeding 500 yuan from local shops for loans of 100 to 500 yuan. The amount will be extrapolated for larger amounts, and the maximum loan amount for branches is limited to 1,000 yuan. (3) The maximum loan amount per household is 20 yuan, with monthly interest calculated at two percent (i.e., 0.2 yuan of interest per month for a 10 yuan loan). (4) The branch is responsible for the loaned funds. If a borrower flees, the Finance Bureau can be requested to transfer the case to the Public Security Bureau for arrest and pursuit. In addition, it is planned to establish public pawnshops to help the poor who are being exploited by private pawnshops, and preparations are underway. (July 30)</p>
<h3>Japanese Fleet Changes Date of Arrival in Xiamen; Scheduled to Arrive on the 5th and Depart on the Same Day; The Strength of the Combined Fleet</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The Japanese Combined Fleet was originally scheduled to conduct large-scale maneuvers in the Fujian Sea and the Taiwan Strait starting on August 1. It is now known that the Xiamen Municipal Government has received instructions from the provincial government, stating: "According to Mr. Sukeyuki Sukegawa, a colonel in the Japanese Navy, the Japanese Navy Combined Fleet, consisting of more than seventy warships of various sizes and 28,000 officers and soldiers, including 1,600 officers, led by Admiral Takahashi Sankichi, will conduct large-scale exercises from August 1 to 5. The north-south range extends from the important ports of Keelung and Magong to over 3,000 nautical miles south, and the east-west range extends from near Xiamen to over 2,000 nautical miles east. The southern side is the attacking force, represented by blue, and the northern side is the defending force, represented by red in the Japanese case. In order to prevent misunderstandings, this is being notified." However, the fleet was unable to arrive in Taiwan as scheduled due to weather conditions on its return voyage from exercises in the South Seas. Therefore, its arrival in Xiamen has also been changed. According to a telegram from Sukegawa on the 28th, notifying the Japanese Consul in Xiamen, Yoshitaro Yamada, the fleet is now scheduled to arrive in Xiamen on the morning of August 5 and depart the same evening. The original date has been changed, and Sukegawa is scheduled to arrive in Xiamen on the 30th. Sukegawa also announced the strength of the Combined Fleet in the provincial capital, consisting of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Fleets, the 3rd, 7th, and 8th Squadrons, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Air Squadrons, the 1st and 2nd Submarine Squadrons, and the 1st and 2nd Torpedo Squadrons. The major ship names are as follows: 1st Fleet: Nagato, Fusō, Haruna, Kirishima, Jintsū, Nagara, Sendai, Abukuma, Hatsuharu, Nenohi, Hatsuyuki, Wakaba, Minazuki, Mizuho, Fumizuki, Nagatsuki, Rokutsuki, Kisaragi, Yayoi, Uzuki, Jingei, Hōshō, Ryūjō, Asakaze, Harukaze, Matsukaze, Hatakaze, etc. 2nd Fleet: Myōkō, Nachi, Haguro, Kinugasa, Aoba, Furutaka, Ikazuchi, Inazuma, Hibiki, Amagiri, Asagiri, Shinonome, Isonami, Uranami, Shikishima, Ayanami, Kinu, Kaga, Oite, Hayate, etc. 3rd Fleet: Kuma, Yūbari, Wakatake, Saotome, Kuretake, Fuyō, Karukaya, Asagao, etc. Attached Units: Mamiya, Naruto, Tsurumi. The main officers participating in the exercises are Admiral Takahashi Sankichi, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet and Commander of the 1st Fleet; Vice Admiral Katō Takayoshi, Commander of the 2nd Fleet; Vice Admiral Hara Keitaro; Rear Admiral Saren Saburo, etc. The Japanese side also invited Provincial Chairman Chen Yi to visit Xiamen when the fleet arrives. According to Xiamen Mayor Li Shilin, who returned to Xiamen from the province on the 28th, the chairman was unable to attend due to busy official duties, so he specifically instructed him to represent him in hosting the fleet when it arrives in Xiamen, to fulfill the obligations of the host. Furthermore, the unprecedented exercises of the Japanese fleet in the Fujian Sea were scheduled a month ago. Coincidentally, there were upheavals in the Southwest and tension in North China, creating internal and external unrest. As a result, people were quite uneasy. Sukegawa repeatedly explained that they were normal exercises and had no political implications. He also stated that the Japanese Navy traditionally conducts exercises in North China every two years and in South China every five years. However, he also said that this large-scale Combined Fleet exercise had not been held for twenty years, and the strength of the Japanese fleet today far exceeds that of twenty years ago. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that this exercise in the South Seas and the Fujian Sea of South China is unprecedented. (July 30)</p>
<h3>Major Riot by Workers on the Suzhou-Wuxi Road; Destroying Police Stations and Looting Firearms; Eighty-Four Workers Detained</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: The Suzhou-Wuxi Road project was ordered last year by the Jiangsu Construction Department to be jointly built by the Suzhou and Wuxi County Construction Bureaus, with the dividing line being from the third district of Wuxi to Wangting. The earthwork for this project was completed at the end of last year. This year, the Construction Department formally established the Suzhou-Wuxi Road Engineering Office outside the West Gate of Wuxi, appointing Wu Tingzuo as the director, responsible for paving the entire road surface, and establishing branch engineering offices along the road. Ye Lanqing was appointed as the deputy engineer and also served as the section chief of the first section in Zhoushinzhen, responsible for everything. Recently, a small foreman named Yang Kejian hired ten ox carts and ten cart workers from Danyang to facilitate the loading of paving stones. They originally lived in the home of Zhang Ahei in Peng Lane near Zhoushinzhen, and had been there for eighteen days. On the 29th, they moved to Liu Lane and forcibly tried to rent a house from the Hua Zhang family. The Hua Zhang family refused, resulting in a conflict. Hua Zhang was injured in the left shoulder by workers using a rake, bleeding profusely and in critical condition. His son, Hua Rongquan, learned of the incident and reported it to the town chief, Shao Ziliang, and the Bao chief, Xu Xiyan, who negotiated with the branch engineering office of the town, but were also beaten. They went to the eighth branch office to report and request detention. Zheng Qiqiang, the chief of the branch office, received the report and sent Police Chief Gu and his officers to detain five workers who caused the incident, taking them back to the office for interrogation. Unexpectedly, more than three hundred road construction workers, with great momentum, swarmed to the eighth branch office and rioted. They first snatched the box guns from the gatekeepers, Xu Jiren and Xu Bei. The twenty-five police officers of the office were outnumbered and retreated. The workers broke into the armory and looted twenty rifles, two box cannons, two pistols, and ammunition. They released the five detained workers and destroyed everything they could find and beat anyone they encountered. The chief of the branch office, Zheng Qiqiang, was also injured. The company headquarters of the first battalion of the 212th regiment of the 106th brigade of the 36th division, stationed in Yang Lane in Zhoushinzhen, heard the news and sent soldiers to suppress the riot and fired hundreds of rounds into the sky. The workers gradually dispersed. The shops in the town closed their doors and went on strike. Chen, the chief of the county public security bureau, received the news and immediately dispatched all the police officers from the inspection department and the cavalry team to the countryside to suppress the riot. The county government received the news and also sent sixty soldiers from the fourth squadron of the security team, along with ammunition, to the countryside to maintain order. That night, all the soldiers and police imposed martial law in the area, while searching for the workers who caused the incident. As a result, they arrested foreman Chen Hanchen, workers Wang Daocai, Li Fengxiang, Zhu Huacheng, and eighty-four others, mostly from Shandong, and confiscated more than thirty weapons such as iron rakes and hoes. At about 1:00 p.m. on the 30th, they were escorted to the city and placed under the custody of the detention center, waiting for trial. Zheng Qiqiang, the chief of the eighth branch office, reported the situation to the head office for review, and invited Dr. Ma Jichen to treat his injuries at the office. Most of the firearms lost from the office have been recovered, except for one rifle, one Bai Langlin pistol, and one box cannon. The search is still ongoing. The damage inside the office is also under investigation, and the exact amount has not yet been determined. After the patrol chief Sun Nitang of the eighth branch office persuaded them, the shops in Zhoushinzhen reopened at 7:00 a.m. on the 30th. Only a small number of workers on the Suzhou-Wuxi Road are working. Most of the workers are on strike. The arrested workers were interrogated one by one by Director Tu of the first department of the public security bureau for a long time. At 3:00 p.m., they were escorted to the local court along with documents prepared by Director Chen. At 4:30 p.m., three prosecutors, Shen, Ren, and Lu, separately interrogated them in court and will review the case.</p>
<h3>Graduation of the Songjiang Teachers' Training Institute</h3>
<p>The Teachers' Training Institute, organized by the administrative commissioner of the Songjiang district, included students from nine counties in the district, as well as from thirty counties such as Nantong and Tongshan, for a total of 444 students. Classes began on May 1 and have now completed their training. The graduation ceremony was held at 9:00 a.m. on the 30th. Of those who had been expelled for violating regulations or had left due to illness, 397 students actually attended, forming three squads. The officials who came to inspect were Niu Changyao, a member of the provincial party headquarters; Xiang Zhizhuang, director of the security office; Wu Jianzhen, representative of the education department; Zhang Jingshi, a technician; a Yu representative from the military affairs commission; Li Leng, the county magistrate of this county; and county magistrates and party representatives from various counties. The graduating students gathered at the small drill ground. The local civil servants' training class, the fire brigade training class, and the canal dredging training class, all in uniform, arrived at the field in formation and jointly underwent inspection. Commissioner Wang presided over the ceremony, performing the rituals. Then, the students from the Teachers' Training Institute and others formed a team to be inspected by Director Xiang, and performed various drills. Geng Jixian, a staff officer of the district headquarters, served as the chief commander of the inspection. Then, speeches were given by Xiang, Niu, Wu, Yu, and others. Afterward, the fire brigade demonstrated water shooting. The ceremony concluded and was adjourned. This time, all graduating students were given certificates by Commissioner Wang, and the first-place winner was awarded a command knife, a waist bag, and a water bag. The second and third-place winners also received prizes. On the 31st, they were all ordered to return to their respective counties to serve.</p>
<h3>Side Issues in the Case of Nie Dezhao in Suzhou</h3>
<p>Nie Dezhao, an adjutant of the 7th Security Battalion stationed in Suzhou, was accused of selling military equipment and embezzling food rations for prisoners. The civil affairs department instructed him to be suspended from his duties, and after the second district commissioner's office sent personnel to Suzhou to investigate, Xu Xianmin, the squad leader suspected of being involved, was handed over to the special task force for custody, pending review. However, Xu Xianmin suddenly escaped the other day. As a result, Deng, the concurrent battalion commander, imprisoned the squad members who were guarding Xu Xianmin and released Xu Qimin on bail, who was suspected of facilitating the escape, giving him ten days to bring Xu Guangmin to justice. Liu Xuqimin has gone to Shanghai to search for him. Battalion Commander Deng believes that there may have been an organization behind Xu Xianmin's escape, because Xu was an important figure in the bombing case, so he is secretly investigating. Commissioner Zang reported the previous situation and ordered Battalion Commander Deng to strictly arrest Xu and investigate him to the fullest extent. If necessary, the case may be transferred to Wuxi for interrogation. After Nie Dezhao was suspended, he was ordered to post bail and await investigation.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yao Shuhui Flees</h3>
<p>After the death of Zhang Hebo, the fourth son of the late wealthy gentleman Zhang Yuejie of Yingchunfang, his wife Zhang Yao Shuhui and his concubine Li Yuanru had been in litigation for several years over the inheritance of property for Zhang Yixin, the posthumous son. As a result, Zhang Yao Shuhui lost the lawsuit. Therefore, Li Yuanru had already obtained permission from the Wudi court to auction off the old mansion with a garden in Yingchunfang. The details of this matter had been reported in this newspaper. A man named Li Dingsheng sued Zhang Yao Shuhui in the Shanghai Special Court for defamation, but because it was impossible to summon her, an arrest warrant had been issued. The Wuxian Local Court scheduled a hearing on the 31st to discuss the auction of the house. Zhang Yao Shuhui suddenly fled in fear of punishment, and her whereabouts are unknown. Her family is said to be very anxious.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Investigating Police Administration Throughout the County</h3>
<p>Yu, the director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, in order to reform the police administration of Jiangsu and prepare for the implementation of the police officer system, specially dispatched Qin Xiangchen, an instructor from the police academy, leading ten graduating students to Xixi on the 27th, to investigate the actual situation of public security. The investigation items are: (1) Investigation on the division of police officers; (2) Investigation on the establishment of police stations and sub-stations; (3) Investigation on the location of setting up police outposts and碉堡in the four suburban areas; (4) Investigation on the routine police preparedness; (5) Investigation on firearms, police quota and funding. The students have been investigating in the hot weather recently, and the police officers of various sub-bureaus in the urban area are generally in good spirits and their internal affairs are quite tidy. However, there are occasional few police officers who seem to be negligent in etiquette. It is reported that the students are scheduled to go to various sub-bureaus and stations in rural areas today (32nd) for investigation, and will then go to Yixing for investigation upon completion.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Verdict on Sabotage of River Works Case</h3>
<p>In Shazhou City, the seventh district, the excavation of the Second Main Canal was opposed by some people, led by Tan Jiujin and Ding Shishu, who gathered hundreds of people to destroy the river works and the township head's residence. When the county sent security teams to the countryside to suppress them, they also resisted by beating gongs. The matter was resolved two weeks later. The main criminals were all on the run. Subsequently, Tan, Ding and other nine principal offenders were arrested in Wuxi and Jiangyin and sent to the special commissioner's office for review, and then returned to the county for judicial trial. The verdict was made on the morning of the 30th, Chen Bajin, Tan Jiujin, Ding Shishu, Huang Guansheng, Xu Da, Zhu Shuiguan, Qiu Genlin, Lu Hongyi and other nine people were sentenced to three years and nine months in prison each for sabotage of river works and escape. However, Tan Jiujin and Chen Bajin stated in court that they were opposed to the river works because it was the will of the people, arguing that since the government had already levied water conservancy fees, it should not levy labor for dredging the river again. Based on this key point, they declared their dissatisfaction in court and filed an appeal.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Cotton Seedlings in Reclamation Area Suffer from Insect Pests</h3>
<p>The cotton crop in the coastal reclamation area of Jiangbei this year is not growing well due to insufficient rainfall. Recently, leaf-rolling insects have suddenly appeared, and the situation is very rampant. The Cotton Improvement Institute is trying to eradicate them. The insect pest losses in the reclamation area under the jurisdiction of Tongtai last year amounted to more than 10 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Opposition to Dividing the Si District to Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Ge Tan, the special commissioner of the Fourth District of Jiangsu Province, reported to the Provincial Government that the residents of Jinping and other townships in the Fifth District of Chongming County had successively submitted petitions, stating that the Shengsi Islands belonged to Jiangsu for a long time and strongly opposed the proposal to divide them to Zhejiang, requesting a strong defense. Therefore, the original petition was copied and submitted, requesting approval.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Fierce Battle Between Soldiers and Bandits in Xiangshan</h3>
<p>Jie'ao in Jiajie Township, Xiangshan, borders Ninghai. It is a mountainous area with many bandits. In order to facilitate the suppression of bandits, the Provincial Security Team sent the First Squadron to Ninghai, so that it could provide nearby support in case of bandit alarms. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 27th, more than ten bandits were found gathering in Jie'ao to挖花. This was spotted by local farmers, who immediately reported to the First Squadron. The squadron leader immediately joined forces with the militia team and rushed to Jie'ao overnight, surrounding the bandits on all sides. The bandits also resisted with guns, and a fierce gun battle broke out. The fighting continued until dawn on the 28th, when the bandits were unable to hold on and fled to the mountains behind. In this battle, a total of four bandits were killed, and three wooden-shell guns were seized. The squadron leader was wounded in the shoulder and was sent to Huangshun Hospital by the soldiers for treatment.</p>

<h3>Jiaxing: Head of Public Security Section Resigns</h3>
<p>The Jiaxing County Government handles drug enforcement cases, which are all judged by Li Yuan, the head of the Public Security Section. Now, when hearing a certain tobacco case, someone falsely used his name to extort money. Recently, the facts of the case have been exposed and are being investigated. In order to show his innocence, Director Li resigned yesterday and requested a thorough investigation of the case to clarify the matter.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan: Bumper Harvest of Early Rice</h3>
<p>Daqiao, Daicun, Taohu and other districts in the southern part of Xiaoshan have been planting early rice. Every year after the new rice is harvested, it is sold locally and in Keqiao, with a value of more than ten thousand taels of gold. Now the early rice in the district has been harvested, and the yield per mu of civilian land has reached about 300 catties. It is said that fields with larger areas have yielded 400 catties. The actual harvest is unprecedented in the past five years.</p>
<h3>Beihai</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Beiping</p>
<p>— A Panoramic View of Beiping's Scenery —</p>
<p>Beihai, Nanhai, Zhonghai, Zhongshan Park, the Temple of Emperors, the Museum of Antiquities, and the Historical Museum are all very close to each other. In the past, they were originally the gardens, ancestral temples, and palaces of emperors, and like the Forbidden City in the nearby imperial city, they were forbidden areas. Common people had no chance to see their beauty. After the Republic of China, these places were opened to the public before and after the Forbidden City. Therefore, their magnificent layout, magnificent architecture, and secluded scenery were all exposed to the eyes of the people, arousing endless amazement. In 1924, after Puyi left the palace, the Forbidden City was opened the following year (1925). Since then, this area can be freely visited without obstruction. Whether it is the layout, architecture, or scenery, it is the best place in Beiping. Moreover, the location is in the center of Beiping, and transportation is convenient, so it attracts tens of thousands of tourists every day. Foreign guests and tourists from other places, all who visit this place, praise it and linger, reluctant to leave. Beihai is the most famous of the Three Seas, which are three outstanding lakes. It is located north of the Forbidden City, and is bounded by the Jinyu Bridge with Zhonghai. The front gate faces south, on the east side of Tuan Cheng, and the back gate faces north, across the road from Shichahai. Entering the front gate, after a few dozen steps, you reach Beihai. In the sea is Qionghua Island. Crossing a bridge, you reach the island. After reaching the island, visitors usually have three routes to take. The east side of the mountain island, walking hundreds of steps, crossing a bridge to the outer edge of the sea, or not crossing the bridge to Yilan Hall, this is one route. From the west side of the island, walking to Yilan Hall, this is another route. Going straight north, through the Duiyun Archway, up Baitashan, passing Yong'an Temple and other places, from the north foot of the mountain, through a stone cave and down to Yilan Hall, this is the third route. After reaching Yilan Hall, most people hire boats to tour the sea, or take a large boat across the sea to the Five Dragon Pavilions on the north bank. However, there are also those who go from the east side of Qionghua Island, crossing the bridge along the northeast bank of the sea, walking about half a mile to reach the Five Dragon Pavilions. Visitors to Beihai take different routes depending on their different interests. But in general, their interests fall into three categories: (1) Climbing the mountain and overlooking the entire city of Beiping; (2) Touring the sea and admiring the lotus flowers; (3) Sipping tea, enjoying the cool, and chatting leisurely to pass the summer.</p>
<p>Climbing the Mountain for a Distant View</p>
<p>The only mountain in the garden is Baitashan on Qionghua Island. This mountain is not as high as the Western Mountains outside the city, nor as majestic as Jingshan, which is close at hand. But its structure is exquisite and its shape is unique. Its shady trees and the two spots standing in the water are particularly rare among the mountains in Beiping.</p>
<p>After passing through Duiyun Archway and climbing Baitashan, the first place you reach on the south side of the mountain is Yong'an Temple. In the temple are the Guanghan Hall and the Falun Hall. Behind the Falun Hall are two pavilions. Further back are the Zhengjue Hall and the Puan Hall. There are a total of four halls and two pavilions. Although they are all covered in dust and the colors are mottled, one can still imagine their scale and prosperity in the past from their carved beams and painted rafters. The halls are all built according to the terrain of the mountain slope. There are dozens of stone steps between each hall. While touring the halls, visitors are also gradually climbing the mountain. By the time they finish touring and leave the temple, they have unknowingly reached the summit of the mountain. Climbing the mountain is indeed a difficult task, but doing it while sightseeing does not make one feel tired. The intention is indeed very clever. Inside the halls, there is nothing much to see except for the golden Buddha and Arhat statues. The reason why visitors linger here is simply to touch the relics and express their nostalgia. Between the second and third halls, I don't know where, there is a radio receiver, but the sound is not clear. It makes a strange noise all day long, which is very harsh and does not harmonize with the quiet air in the mountains. The Zhengjue Hall and the Puan Hall are usually inaccessible to people. Therefore, climbers usually climb up the stone steps next to the stone cave.</p>
<p>Baitashan is named after the white pagoda on its top. This pagoda is originally a Lamaist architectural style, which is very different from the so-called "stupa" with seven levels. The bottom layer is square, slightly above it is flat and round, like an old-fashioned food box, further up is oval, like an inverted Qing, further up is a very long and towering cone, and on the top of the cone are two layers like hats and umbrellas, and the top is a gourd shape. This pagoda is more than ten feet high, and the whole body is milky white. When He Yingqin was in charge of the military branch in Ping, he donated money for repairs, so it is brand new. The sunlight reflects it, and it is very artistic in the green bushes. This pagoda cannot be climbed. In front of the pagoda is the Shanyin Hall. There are dozens of white alum stone steps on the left and right sides of the hall. Climbing up the steps, you reach the Shanyin Hall. The door of the hall is locked and people cannot enter. However, the walls around the outside of the hall are all made of emerald green and tender yellow glazed bricks. On each brick, there is a small Buddha carved in relief, about a foot high. In total, there are no less than hundreds of statues on the four walls. However, the noses of the small Buddhas are mostly dug away, and none of them are intact. I don't know why. Some say that it is a rumor that there are gold treasures embedded in the nose, and others say that it was accidentally dug away by tourists. I don't know which one is true. The hall enshrines the镇海佛(also known as the Thousand-Hand Thousand-Eye Buddha). The statue is a bronze seated statue, more than ten feet high, with a rather hideous appearance. There are three layers of heads, and the lower layer has three heads. There are more than a dozen hands and five or six rows of feet, fully armed, holding all kinds of weapons, stepping on strange birds, beasts, and humans, and the waist belts and neck ornaments are all human heads.</p>
<p>The Shanyin Hall is located on the top of the mountain. Standing in front of it, you can have a panoramic view of the city of Beiping. In the distance, there are the shadows of mountains and clouds, yellow tiles and red walls. In the near distance, there are lotus leaves everywhere,游船 like dragonflies, and leaves like the sea, a green everywhere, which is enough to add color to the ancient capital and make people forget the dust. Tourists take out cameras to capture this artistic and poetic scene. Who knows that the "Da Da Da Da..." sound that comes with the wind is the sound of soldiers from a certain country firing live ammunition with machine guns.</p>
<p>Behind the top of the mountain, there is the Linguang Hall. There is a tea seat here, where you can enjoy tea and enjoy the scenery on the north side of the mountain. In the stone wall of the Yuegu Building next to the hall, there are embedded imperial calligraphy posts from the Sanxi Hall. From here, it is the way down the mountain. However, the scenery is different from when climbing the mountain, because climbing the mountain is through the halls, while this is through the diamond cave, or around the veranda. The stone caves and verandas are all extremely steep. Looking at them suddenly, one feels scared and dare not move. But the structure is ingenious, and there are railings and handrails everywhere to rely on. However, high heels and hard-soled leather shoes can also pass without hindrance. There are those who are tired and red-faced and sweating, but accidents of slipping and falling are rarely seen.</p>
<p>The west and east sides of the mountain are not much to see. If there are any, they are just dense trees and strange rocks. Therefore, those who usually climb the mountain do not often go there. Most of them go down from the north foot of the mountain to Yilan Hall. Yilan Hall faces the sea, and the winding corridor hugs the northeast foot of the mountain. The corridor is dozens of feet long. The red lacquer corridor pillars and white stone railings are reflected like a book. There are tea seats and dining seats. 遊船 and those crossing the sea to the Five Dragon Pavilions all take this as a starting point.</p>
<p>Water Scenery</p>
<p>The water of the Three Seas originates from Yuquan Mountain outside the city. In the Yuan Dynasty, it was called Taiye Pond. Beihai is its northern section. The water flows in through the water gate at the back door, making a gurgling sound. The dirty mud and debris are all blocked outside the gate, so the water is very clear. It is more than ten feet deep in some places, and usually about three to four feet deep. Lotus flowers are planted everywhere in it. The lotus leaves are so dense that you cannot see the water. The breeze is gentle, and the faint fragrance makes people drunk. Fish jump in it from time to time, and the sound of splashing adds a poetic touch to the elegant atmosphere. Boats are divided into large boats and small boats. Large boats can be chartered in addition to passenger ferries, but they are rowed by boatmen. Those who hire these large boats are mostly families traveling together, or many friends, and want to drink and eat in them. These large boats are made in the style of painting boats, and the layout is quite elegant and clean. There are more than a dozen of them. Small boats are shaped like olives with two pointed ends, more than ten feet long, and are most suitable for three people to ride. It is too crowded to have more than that. The boats are painted white, and the oars are painted green. If you can row the oars properly, you can also go fast. The first point of mining for this kind of small boat requires a rental fee of eight corners, and the second point of refining can be reduced to five corners. Ordinary tourists still inevitably find it expensive, but they are often unable to stop because of the water, light, mountains and colors. There are about dozens of this kind of small boat.</p>
<p>The sea water is wider on the east, north, and west sides. There are erected piles in the water, tied with iron wires, to mark the waterway for游船. 遊艇 can start from Yilan Hall and circle around Huanhua Island. It usually takes half an hour to an hour to circle the island once. But in general, they only row back and forth on the water surface between Yilan Hall and the Five Dragon Pavilions on the northeast side, or on the water surface on the west side of the island. However, there are also those who are moved by curiosity and travel around the island, which must pass through several bridge holes, where the cool air is immersive, and the evening sunlight slanting on the walls of the holes is a different flavor.</p>
<p>On the water, there is laughter and shouting, and singing answers each other. In terms of race, those who are fat and large, and who often bring telescopes or cameras to their eyes, are Europeans and Americans. Those who are solemn and silent in the boat, with men with a short beard and women with a hunchback, are people from a certain friendly country. As for our compatriots, at first glance, there is no big difference in appearance, but if you listen carefully to their language, then "die (the sound of the Beiping "xi" character) fast (the sound of the Beiping "kua" character) Zai,") is the soft scolding of a Wu Xia Jiao Wa, "Oh, what's the matter, what is this," is the loud Beiping question, "What are you doing, what are you doing?" Those who are imposing and yelling are people from the three northeastern provinces, "To (the Beiping "Yao" character sound) get (the Beiping "of" character sound)" are Sichuanese. In short, there are all kinds of dialects from all provinces. Occasionally, there are also Indians, Koreans, and Annamese who come here to 遊船, and they are not at all timid. This point is enough to show the greatness and tolerance of the old capital.</p>
<p>遊船 during the day is best when the sun sets and the slanting light reflects the water surface like thousands of golden threads. However, at night, in the colorful lights, in the pale moonlight, and under the brilliant starlight, it is a different flavor to be comfortable on a boat with a few songs. Compared to the daytime, it is more poetic. The Five Dragon Pavilions are located on the outer edge of the north of the sea, all protruding into the water. The middle pavilion is particularly prominent. The remaining four pavilions are symmetrical on the left and right. There is a curved embankment connecting the five pavilions. The middle pavilion is called "Longze", and the others are "Congxiang", "Zixiang", "Yongrui" and "Fucui". Facing the blue water, behind the pillow仮山, beautiful leaves are abundant in the surroundings, and the shadows of the trees sway at the corners of the tail. The breeze is blowing, and游鱼 often float to the surface of the water, vying for the瓜子shells thrown down. People sitting here really have the concept of assimilation with all things, and the heat of the humid summer is completely dissipated. It can be called a good place to cool off.</p>
<p>In the five pavilions, there are tea seats, dining seats, cold and hot food, everything is available. The price is slightly higher than outside, but the taste is also good. The five have hundreds of seats. When it is hot, it is often full. Those who come later set up seats on the embankment outside the pavilion. Here, there are businessmen and philosophers talking high and wide, and there are poets and scholars tasting tea alone. Other people who are famous in society also occasionally come here to show their faces. But everything is in order, even if the whole family eats here, or arranges seats to pour wine and entertain guests, it does not feel complicated. As for young men and women, borrowing this as a place to talk is commonplace. Their waiters are also mostly polite, giving people a pleasant impression.</p>
<p>In terms of stay time, some leave after sitting for a while, and some stay all day. However, after 11 o'clock in the evening, the bell rings and the market is closed, and you can no longer stay.</p>
<p>The most meaningful thing is the evening after a summer rain. Try sitting with a chair across the water from Yilan Hall, then the lights flicker in the water, like hundreds of colorful pillars, the sound of frogs is noisy on the right, like the spring, the sound of fish leaping and splashing often comes from inside the lotus, and bats flutter between the light and the darkness. In addition, with a volume of poetry in hand, this scene and this feeling are by no means what pen and ink can describe even ten thousandth of it. It seems that it is no longer the human world, but when you think of this as the old capital of a dangerous city, you feel that you are lost. 言之殊感之至。</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Compiles Budget for the 25th Year, Expenditures Set at 10 Million Yuan, Previous Year's Deficit Cannot be Made Up</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since Xu Fu took over as the Director of Finance, the city's finances have been vigorously reorganized and have gradually stabilized. As the 25th year has begun, the new budget for this year is being actively compiled by the Finance Bureau in conjunction with various bureaus and offices. According to reporters, during the tenure of Cai Zengji as Director, the city's finances were unusually short, so the various expenses of the city government's various agencies could not be paid on time. After Cai left office, Xu Fu took over and tried his best to find funds for all the missing funds and paid them in full. Now they are paid on time, but compared with the income and expenditure of the previous year, there is a shortage of more than 5 million yuan, and there is no way to make up for it. The budget for the 25th year has been set at 10 million yuan and is currently being compiled. However, according to the main business of each bureau, they all hope to have expansion, and the current financial situation is still difficult to fully realize. Therefore, after the budget of each bureau is sent, the Finance Bureau will consider the actual situation and weigh the priorities, and try to allocate as much as possible within the number stipulated by the Municipal Government. In short, the bureau will make efforts to eliminate various malpractices in tax collection so as to collect the full amount, and strive to be thrifty in expenditure, hoping that there will be no shortage in the 25th year.</p>
<h3>City General Labor Union: A Loyal Admonishment to Li and Bai</h3>
<p>The City General Labor Union telegraphed to Guangxi Province yesterday, saying: "To Mr. Li Delin and Mr. Bai Jiansheng in Nanning, Having been awarded, we believe that your claim that troops are being moved is causing national indignation. According to party discipline and national law, you must be punished. However, the Central Government, in memory of your past revolutionary history, has been magnanimous and appointed one to be in charge of military affairs and one to be in charge of provincial administration, hoping that you will serve the country and comfort the people. Unexpectedly, since the announcement of the new order, the news of taking office has been silent, and the movements of disobedience have been frequent. At this time, the country is in difficulty, and worries are presented one after another. The cultivation of national strength cannot allow another civil war to be seen today. The union, for the sake of national security and ethnic survival, makes a last loyal admonition with a sincere heart. I hope that you will not rely on external forces to harbor ambitions of rebellion, and lose the glorious history of the past for the party and the country, repent, withdraw troops into Guangxi, go north to take office, and work together for national affairs. If you continue to be stubborn and go your own way, imitating the old tricks of warlord remnants to destroy the vitality of the people, then the 800,000 workers of Shanghai will not forgive you. The telegram is urgent. With utmost respect, The Shanghai General Labor Union, respectfully."</p>
<h3>Xu Fu Newly Appointed as Lieutenant General Councilor of the Military Affairs Commission</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Xu Fu, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau and concurrently Director of the Land Bureau, is dedicated to his position and has a long history. He held an important position at the beginning of the establishment of the Whampoa Military Academy and contributed much to the construction of the party army. During the Northern Expedition, he served as the Administrative Commissioner of the Eastern Jiang River in Guangdong Province and was transferred to the Director of the Military Supply Department and concurrently Director of the Audit Department of the General Headquarters of the National Revolutionary Army. He made great achievements in raising funds. After Nanjing was established as the capital, he served as the director of the General Headquarters's management, military law and other departments. He followed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the Northern Expedition and made great achievements. In 1928, the National Government, because of the chaos in Fujian Province's finances, appointed him as a member of the Provincial Government and Director of Finance of the province to rectify tax revenue and abolish harsh taxes. The people still praise him today. In 1929, when Zhang Xuejun was in charge of the Shanghai Municipality, he tried to persuade him to serve as the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, issue municipal bonds, and open a municipal bank, laying the foundation for the city's economic construction. After the Fujian Incident, the finances of Fujian Province were destroyed and in great chaos. The Central Government appointed him as a member of the Provincial Committee and Director of Finance for two years, and all affairs were restored. This year, the former Director of Finance of the Shanghai Municipality, Cai Zengji, had other duties. At a time when finances were exhausted, Mayor Wu earnestly requested the Central Government to transfer him back to the Finance Bureau. After several months of reorganization, he was fortunate to overcome the difficulties, and tax revenue is also improving day by day. Now, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, because of his contributions to military finance, specially appointed him as a Lieutenant General Councilor of the Military Affairs Commission and officially appointed him on the 23rd of this month with Appointment Order No. 2213, in order to provide advice. It is said that he is also happy to serve because he believes that everyone is responsible for the country's difficulties.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the National Economic Council: List of Committee Members to be Announced Soon</h3>
<p>Since Mayor Wu entrusted Xu Fu, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, Wu Xingya, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhou Yongneng, a member of the Municipal Government, to prepare the Shanghai Branch of the National Economic Council, the various procedures have been largely completed. It is now known that the preparatory office has recently submitted the list of committee members to the Municipal Government. After the articles of association of the branch are issued to the government, they can be officially announced. It is decided that most of the committee members will be leaders in the business and financial circles of the city, so that all national economic construction can be fully developed under the cooperation of officials and people.</p>

<h3>Early Rice Harvests in Various Regions, Shanghai Grain Market is Definitely Secure, 400,000 Bags of Rice in Stock, Prices Decline, Rice Merchants' Orders for Foreign Rice Have Disappeared</h3>
<p>A New Voice News Agency Reporter Visited Mr. Gu Xinyi Yesterday Morning. According to Him, the Rice Producing Areas in Our Country are Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Other Provinces, Among Which Hunan and Anhui Provinces Produce the Most Rice. In Addition to Supplying the Province, They are also Transported and Sold to Other Provinces. However, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Other Provinces can Only Supply the Needs of Their Own Provinces. The Number Transported Out of the Province is Very Small. Zhejiang Province's Rice Production is Insufficient to Supply the Needs of the Province. Farmers Plant Rice in Three Seasons: Early, Middle, and Late. This Year's Early Rice Harvest in Anhui and Hunan is a Full Ten Percent. Harvesting has Already Begun, and in Half a Month, it can be Transported to Shanghai for Sale. As for the Early Rice in Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hubei, and Other Provinces, Although it is not as Good as that in Hunan and Anhui, it can also be Expected to be a Bumper Harvest. However, the Bulk of Rice Production in Various Provinces is Late Rice. The Number of Early and Middle Rice is Limited, so the Only Hope is that this Year's Late Rice will also be a Bumper Harvest. Currently, the Total Rice Stock in Shanghai is 400,000 Bags, Which is Enough to Supply for More than a Month. Moreover, Rice from Various Regions is Still Being Transported to Shanghai Continuously. The Bumper Harvest of Early Rice in Anhui and Hunan, so This Year There is Definitely no Shortage of Food in Our Country. Shanghai Rice Prices have Fallen Due to the Bumper Harvest of Early Rice in Hunan and Anhui. The Price of Top-Grade Rice is Eleven Yuan Per Dan [unit of measurement], which is about Fifty Cents Lower than Last Week. It is Expected that When Early Rice is Transported to Shanghai, Rice Prices May Fall Again. As for Rice Merchants' Orders for Foreign Rice and Broken Foreign Rice, they have Now Disappeared, Because the Ordered Prices are Too Unfavorable.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Approves Opinions on Industrial Control: Control Must be for Increasing Production, Not for Restricting Production</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Previously Drafted a Plan on the Issue of Industrial Control and Submitted it to the Ministry of Industry for Formulation and Promulgation. Yesterday, a Response from the Ministry of Industry was Received, Stating, "Submitted, Noted. In Order to Take into Account the Future Promotion in Various Regions and to Ensure that There are no Obstacles, the Ministry Copied and Sent the Original Draft to Solicit Opinions from Provincial and Municipal Governments. Most Argued that to Save Industry, Control Must be for Increasing Production and Absolutely Cannot be for Restricting Production. It is Inappropriate to Take the Situation and Requests of One Corner as the Basis for Legislation. The Ministry is Currently Planning Comprehensively and Starting to Draft Various Relevant Laws and Regulations. The Draft Previously Submitted by the Association is Approved for Retention as Reference. Please Be Informed of this Approval."</p>
<h3>Sichuan Sojourners in Shanghai Oppose Japan Setting up a Consulate in Chengdu</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Regarding the Matter of Japan Setting up a Consulate in Chengdu, Sichuan, Yesterday's Newspaper Reported that Sichuan Sojourners in Shanghai Expressed Opposition. The Reporter Especially Went to the Sichuan Sojourners' Association in Shanghai and the Shu Merchants' Public Welfare Association to Inquire About the Details. According to the Person in Charge of the Sichuan Sojourners' Association in Shanghai, After Seeing the News about Japan Establishing a Consulate in Chengdu, the Association Immediately Submitted a Request to the National Government's Executive Yuan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Sichuan Provincial Government to Prevent it from Happening. However, it was not Publicized, so the Outside World was Unaware. If Necessary, the Association will Convene All Sectors of Sichuan Sojourners in Shanghai to Discuss Effective Measures. The Person in Charge also Stated that the Association had Recently Telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Chongqing Customs Supervisory Department of the Sichuan Provincial Government to Effectively Detain Smuggled Goods and Punish Traitorous Merchants in Order to Prevent Sichuan Merchants from Trafficking in Smuggled Goods.</p>
<p>The Original Telegram from the Sichuan Compatriot Association Opposing the Establishment of a Consulate is as Follows: (Omitted Titles) Respectfully Reported: I Have Learned that Recently, Newspapers Reported that Japan will Soon Establish a Consulate General in Chengdu and has Appointed Iwai to Serve as the Consul General in Chengdu. After This News Spread, it has Aroused Great Attention from All Sectors of the Country. Our Government also Believes that Chengdu is Not a Commercial Port and Cannot Set up a Consulate. Moreover, It has Not Received a Formal Notification from the Japanese Government, so it has Remained Silent for the Time Being. However, the Greater Shanghai Evening Post Reported on the 24th of This Month that the Spokesperson of the Information Office of the Japanese Embassy, Izumizu, Told the Newspaper Reporter that Mr. Iwai had Indeed Left Kobe to Come to China to Assume the Position of Consul General in Chengdu. However, Until Now, No Notification has Been Received from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Regarding This Matter. He Should Follow the Order of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and go to Chengdu to Take Office. Currently, Iwai is Scheduled to Depart on the Luyang Maru on August 2nd. The Members of this Association, After Reading the Above Information, are Extremely Disturbed. I Have Learned that Various Countries Set up Consulates in China, Limited to Commercial Ports. However, Chengdu is Not a Commercial Port and, According to the Treaty, Cannot Set up a Consulate. Moreover, Setting up a Consulate is the First Step in Extraterritorial Jurisdiction. Granting the Establishment of Extraterritorial Jurisdiction is No Different from Storing up Calamity for the People. Moreover, Since the September 18th Incident, Japan's Aggression Against China has Become More and More Intense. From the Northeast to the South China and Central China, Increasing Troops and Smuggling have Followed One after Another. Although Our Sichuan is Far Away in the Western Frontier, it is also Coveted by the Aggressors. I am Afraid that After the Establishment of the Consulate, There will be More and More Disputes Among the People, and the Shackles will Become Heavier. This Matter Concerns the Sovereignty of the Nation and the State and the Interests of Our Sichuan Compatriots. It is Extremely Appropriate to Shout Loudly to Awaken Compatriots and Vow to Oppose This Illegal Establishment of a Consulate. In Addition to Actively Contacting Various Sichuan Groups in Shanghai and Holding Meetings to Oppose the Establishment of a Consulate, This Telegram is Sent to Your Attention and Hope You will Approve it. Sichuan Sojourners' Association in Shanghai. (New Voice News Agency)</p>

<h3>Suzhou-Zhejiang Railway Bondholder Group Letter, Please Yu Qiaqing Argue with Reason, Quickly State the Plight of Merchants and the Public to the Authorities, Should Request to be Paid Interest and Repaid in Full According to the Capital</h3>
<p>Yan Zhonglin, Yang Qicheng, Wang Weide, Chen Shenxing, Yang Shizhen and others, representatives of Suzhou-Zhejiang Railway bondholder group, sent a letter to Yu Qiaqing yesterday, which said: "Respectfully, after the Suzhou-Zhejiang Railway (now the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway) commercial company shares and the shareholders' meeting of Zhejiang Railway Company decided to issue company bonds and nationalize them, the shares were issued by the former Ministry of Communications of the Railway Securities Public Bonds, which were continued by the Ministry, as stipulated on the face of the bond, all of which were due for repayment early on. It has been a long time since the end of the period (i.e., the twelfth period) of Zhejiang Railway Company, which has not been paid since the seventh year of the Republic of China, and the company bonds have not been repaid. The principal and interest have been delayed for 18 to 19 years. As a result of the non-repayment of principal and interest, the bondholders had no choice but to transfer the aforementioned certificates to others as collateral for turnover. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, the Suzhou-Zhejiang Railway Bondholder Group filed an administrative lawsuit with the former Pingzheng Yuan, and the decision was made to change the former Ministry of Communications' decision not to repay. All the overdue debts of the Suzhou-Zhejiang Railway were presented to the former President for order to be announced in accordance with the principal and interest, but they have not been repaid. Unexpectedly, on July 6th of this year, the local newspapers of this city reported that the Ministry of Railways and the liquidation office of Zhejiang Railway Company's shares and debts announced that 800,000 yuan would be allocated from the loan for the completion of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway to reduce and amortize the aforementioned shares and debts that had not been paid at the end of the period, that is, to return half of the principal and waive the interest on the debts that had been delayed at the end of the period. After reading this, the bondholders were terrified. The term of this bond has been delayed for as long as 18 to 19 years. According to the statutory interest rate and the loan losses incurred due to repeated mortgages, the amount has already been exhausted. The Suzhou-Zhejiang Railway, which has huge annual surpluses, has been profitable for the government and bonuses for the road staff, but the bondholders who have been owed for a long time can only be repaid half of the principal according to the original amount. In terms of the principle of equality between the economic relations and rights of the state and individuals, it is not appropriate. The bondholders and the Suzhou-Zhejiang Railway Bondholder Group have respectively requested the Zhejiang General Assembly to telegraph the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Railways to provide prompt remedies, and have declared in Shenxin two newspapers that it is impossible to recognize this matter. I found that in the third year of the Republic of China, when the Suzhou-Zhejiang Railway was proposed to be nationalized, you and Mr. Jiang Rulin were publicly recommended by the shareholders of the railway company as the signing representatives to go to the capital to sign a contract with the former Ministry of Communications. You have a major relationship with the history of this contract. Today, the competent railway authorities disregard the credit of the road administration and return half of the capital of the debts that have been delayed at the end of the term. As far as the sound of the wind reaches, the impact on the entire national credit is not trivial. You are an elder with lofty virtues and a leader of the Chinese community. When the Suzhou-Zhejiang Railway was nationalized, you were also actually responsible. I dare to state the beginning and end of the matter. Please state the impropriety of reducing the repayment of the principal to President Chiang and the Minister with a fair attitude, and ask them to pay the interest in full and clear the debts in accordance with the capital, so as to save the use of the road debts on the one hand and relieve the suffering of the bondholders for many years on the other hand. In urgent words, I respectfully hope that you will handle it.</p>

<h3>The All-Zhejiang Public Association Cables Regarding the Daishan Tragedy, Presenting Aftermath Opinions</h3>
<p>**Appeal for the Rehabilitation of Innocent Salt Workers Wrongfully Implicated, Calling for Improvement of Previous Inconveniences; Dispatches Sent Yesterday to the Salt Affairs Administration and the Zhejiang Provincial Government**</p>
<p>Regarding the fishermen and salt workers of Daishan, Dinghai, Zhejiang, who, in opposition to the consolidation policy, engaged in an unprecedented tragedy on the thirteenth of this month, involving the killing of officials, destruction of the bureau, and numerous deaths and injuries, the All-Zhejiang Public Association of this port, considering the matter related to their hometown, yesterday separately submitted reports to the Salt Affairs Administration and the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting the rehabilitation of the innocent implicated salt workers and presenting several suggestions for future improvements. The original submissions are transcribed below:</p>
<p>To the Zhejiang Provincial Government</p>
<p>To the esteemed Zhejiang Provincial Government: The All-Zhejiang Public Association believes that the unprecedented Daishan tragedy arose from the greed and arrogance of the Daishan tax officials and their panicky reactions to events. The salt workers' collective petition for a temporary suspension of the consolidation policy was not unreasonable. However, due to the large number of people and conflicting opinions, a minor altercation occurred with the surveyors. The tax police immediately deemed it a rebellion and dispatched a large armed force, opening fire on the crowd. One salt worker was killed and another injured. Foreign fishermen, long dissatisfied with the bureau police, seized the opportunity to retaliate, leading to the horrific tragedy of our officials being killed, the bureau destroyed, and numerous deaths and injuries. The number of deaths includes officials and tax police. Among the civilians, salt workers, fearing disaster, fled, and fishing boats have sailed far away, making it impossible to obtain accurate information. In short, the number of deaths is not small, constituting a truly appalling tragedy. The tax police initiated this incident, while the fishermen were the perpetrators of the violence. The salt workers were merely implicated victims, innocently caught in the crossfire. The dead are gone, and the living have fled, their families half-ruined, unable to resume their livelihoods, hiding in mountain caves, a pathetic sight. Currently, the aftermath of this case is being handled by the Salt Transportation Administration and the Commissioner's Office. The All-Zhejiang Public Association believes that to restore order to the region, it is necessary to first appease the grievances of the salt workers. We propose first investigating the affected salt workers, providing appropriate compensation, persuading the affected salt workers to return to their hometowns and resume their livelihoods, urging manufacturers to simultaneously prepare funds for collection, and compensating the purchase of land for salt production at its value, without arbitrary occupation. Furthermore, the tax police captain who provoked the incident should be severely punished to warn the police that, in the future, their duties should be limited to anti-smuggling, and they should not arbitrarily interfere in other matters. If this is done, the accumulated grievances of the region can be alleviated, and the prosperous fishing industry can be gradually restored. The All-Zhejiang Public Association, with ties to its hometown, cannot remain silent. Regarding fishing and salt taxation, we have prepared improvement measures and will separately cable the Ministry of Finance's Salt Affairs Administration for review. We respectfully submit our views, hoping that your esteemed government will consider them and instruct the Salt Transportation Commissioner's Office and the Ningbo Administrative Office to implement them. We are immensely grateful. Respectfully submitted by the All-Zhejiang Public Association of Shanghai. (The submissions to the Ningbo Administrative Commissioner's Office and the Salt Transportation Commissioner's Office, with similar content, are omitted for brevity.)</p>
<p>To the Salt Affairs Administration</p>
<p>To the esteemed Salt Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance: Regarding the unprecedented tragedy in the Daishan salt fields of Zhejiang, the fishermen initiated the shooting and caused the trouble.</p>
<p>Currently, the case is being investigated for the capture and punishment of the criminals, and the current Acting Bureau Chief of the fields and the Ningbo Commissioner's Office are handling the aftermath. Local order is gradually being restored. The All-Zhejiang Public Association believes that while the fishermen who caused the incident should be severely punished according to the law, their usual hardships should also be given some consideration. Otherwise, with accumulated grievances unaddressed, we fear the recurrence of such unrest. The fishermen feel that the tax police usually abuse their power, are overly critical, and impose harsh penalties, and that the bureau only focuses on tax collection and refuses to consider the needs of the people. Grievances have accumulated deeply, and the eruption was as inevitable as a flood. The fishermen consider the following five points inconvenient, which are described in detail below: Salt that changes color. Salt that has changed color, even if it is slightly faded by rain or water, is immediately subject to fines and confiscation. The confiscated salt can then be freely sold by the salt police. Receiving orders and paying taxes. Under the old rules, fishing salt orders only needed to be obtained once a year. Later, it was changed to once per season. Now, an order must be obtained every time they go to sea. Even if the previous order has not expired and there is still salt remaining, it is considered private salt and subject to confiscation, with taxes charged at five or six times the original rate (four yuan per order). Fixed hours for selling fishing salt, with no flexibility allowed. Fishing depends on the tides. Traditionally, fishermen with tax permits could buy salt and set sail at any time of day. Now, however, fixed hours are set, from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM. No flexibility is allowed before or after these hours. Fishermen with permits but no salt can only gaze at the sea and sigh, suffering significant losses. The above three items not only increase the burden but also create difficulties due to the ease with which errors can occur. We request that these issues be improved to alleviate the suffering of the fishermen. As for salted fish, once it changes color, whether it is light or dark, it is difficult to find buyers. If rice husks are mixed in, the tax police consider it easily mistaken for regular salt after sifting. If rice bran is used, the fish will be steamed and easily rot. Previously, the National Federation of Commerce submitted a request to the Shandong salt authorities to find a way to improve the situation. They agreed to handle it leniently, and Zhejiang should follow that precedent. The life of fishermen at sea is even more difficult than on land. They struggle for survival amidst raging waves. Considering the above, compassion should be shown. At a time when the coastal regions are in turmoil, the fishermen who live on the waves are inherently tough. If they are driven to desperation, imitating the old ways of Wang Zhi and Chen Dong, special consideration must be given. As the All-Zhejiang Public Association has close ties to the region, we respectfully present our views directly, hoping that your esteemed administration will adopt them. We are immensely grateful. Respectfully submitted by the All-Zhejiang Public Association of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Zhejiang Silk Industry Association Held a Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Silk Industry Association Federation, located at Lianzhuli, Avenue Edward VII, held its second joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Attendees included directors Yong Shiru, Yu Shishu, Chen Qinshi, Zhou Yangsong, Zhang Youyi, Jiang Laixian, Chu Huiseng, Chen Xian, silk mill representatives Wang Bingquan, Wang Quan, Zhao Kongyu, Yu Yangsheng, Zhu Jingan, Yao Yingke, and others. Chu Huiseng presided over the meeting. The agenda included a letter from the Wu and Shuanglin Silk Industry Association stating that due to a poor harvest of summer silk in the twenty-fifth year, the silk firms in the town were unable to fully process their silk. The Control Committee considered it a deliberate attempt to be opportunistic and ordered the New Great, Jiu Lun, and Guangcheng firms to forfeit their deposits. The Association requested the province to waive the penalties and return the deposits. The resolution was to send a telegram to the provincial government, considering the actual famine situation in the district this summer, requesting the Control Committee to waive the penalties and return the deposits to alleviate the burden on the merchants. Regarding the case of the spring native silk market this year, where the silk price suddenly fell, and the price could not be adjusted in time, the Control Committee fined the firms. The Association previously submitted a petition to the Ministry for relief and exemption from the penalty, but the matter has not been resolved after a long time. The resolution was to submit a petition to the provincial government instructing the Control Committee to exempt the firms from penalties and return the deposits based on the overseas standard silk prices at the time of purchase and the re-testing and reeling discounts of the firms. Regarding the deduction of samples from the spring raw silk market this year, where the Control Committee repeatedly sampled and tested the silk, resulting in significant losses of samples, the Control Committee should return the silk samples to avoid further losses. The resolution was to submit a petition to the Control Committee for the return of the samples. Regarding the silk industry business tax this year, the Ministry of Finance instructed the Zhejiang Finance Department to refer to past cases and continue to levy a tax of 0.2%. The Zhejiang Finance Department cited the same tax rate in Jiangsu as a pretext and reported back to the Ministry of Finance, insisting on the spring tax rate and not levying according to the 0.5% rate. The resolution was to submit a petition to the Ministry of Finance, citing the situation in Jiangsu counties, earnestly requesting the Ministry to instruct the Zhejiang Finance Department to continue to levy the tax at the rate of 0.2% according to the Ministry's order. Regarding the case of the Control Committee overcharging the silk reeling firms for improvement fees this year, the previous petition for a refund has not yet been approved. The resolution was to submit another petition to the provincial government to instruct the Control Committee to investigate the case and refund the fees. Regarding scheduling a joint meeting with the Jiangsu Provincial Silk Industry Association, the resolution was to hold the joint meeting at 4:00 PM on August 9th at the Shanghai Silk Industry Association on North Shansi Road, and to appoint Chu Huiseng, Chen Qinshi, Xu Xingbin, Zhou Yangsong, and Jiang Laixian as the Association's representatives to the meeting. The meeting adjourned after the agenda was completed.</p>
<h3>The Taikoo Dockyard's "Peace" Run Aground</h3>
<p>**Aground on a Sandbar Outside Wusong; Waiting for High Tide to Attempt Escape**</p>
<p>The "Peace" steamer, which sails the Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Daishan routes, belongs to the Taikoo Dockyard Company in this city. The steamer set sail with passengers and cargo the night before last, and yesterday morning, when approaching the sea off Mount Daqu, it proceeded along the channel on the inside of the circle. Unexpectedly, it strayed from the channel and ran aground on a shallow sandbar near the shore. It was low tide, and the steamer immediately became stuck. The shipowner used a water gauge to measure the depth and found that the water at the bow of the ship was only three feet deep, while the "Peace" itself required at least six feet of water to float. As a result, it lost its ability to move and could not free itself from the sandbar. Yesterday afternoon, the shipowner telegraphed Shanghai, saying that they were waiting for the high tide at night and would take the opportunity to sail off the sandbar if the tide rose high enough. If the tide was not sufficient and it could not free itself, they would telegraph the company again to send a ship to rescue it. The company is currently awaiting news.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Farmers' Association Petitions the Municipal Party Headquarters Not to Force Farmers to Purchase National Flags</h3>
<p>According to Dagongbao, the Municipal Farmers' Association of this city yesterday submitted a petition to the Municipal Party Headquarters, stating: "Recently, various district farmers' associations have reported that police stations in the districts have been dispatching police officers to the countryside to force farmers to purchase national flags, citing their economic difficulties and politely declining. However, the police officers, claiming to be under orders, acted aggressively and threatened to send them to the station for detention and punishment if they did not purchase the flags. The farmers, feeling compelled, have been requesting assistance. In response, we believe that promoting the national flag is an obligation of all citizens, but the high price, bordering on profiteering, hinders promotion. Moreover, poor households are exempt from the requirement to purchase the flag, as stated in the notice issued by the Shanghai Municipal National Flag Uniform Promotion Committee on June 28th, published in Shenbao and Xinwenbao. All poor households are rightfully exempt from purchasing the flag. However, the police stations are now dispatching police officers to restrict purchases, which is akin to coercion. The farmers are bankrupt, which is well known. Forcing them to purchase flags would be tantamount to destroying the agricultural foundation and undermining the farmers' patriotism. We dare not condone this. Given the high price and the current time of year when food is scarce, their livelihoods are already strained. (Omission) Therefore, we respectfully request you to forward this petition to the higher authorities and send a letter to the Public Security Bureau, requesting them to instruct all district stations to stop forcing farmers to purchase flags to alleviate their hardships." In response, the high price of the national flag has already been criticized by all sectors, and the central government has discussed reducing it. However, regarding the forced sales, the Promotion Committee has already warned all promoters not to force purchases. Therefore, the Public Security Bureau's dispatch of police officers to coerce purchases runs counter to the true meaning of promotion. Based on the above, we are submitting this document. We respectfully request your approval to forward it, which would be a public service. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Executive Committee.</p>
<h3>Japanese Businesses Plan to Expand Steel Industry in China, Focusing on Shanghai Factories</h3>
<p>**Avoiding Tariffs and Competing with Britain and the United States**</p>
<p>Mr. Nakayama, the owner of Nakayama Steel Works in Osaka, a major Japanese heavy industry company, visited Shanghai in early June of this year. He then traveled to Tianjin, Dalian, Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin, and Qiqihar in North China to inspect the branches. On the 10th of this month, he returned to Shanghai to plan the expansion of the Shanghai Nakayama Steel Works. Currently, the Shanghai Nakayama Factory produces 450,000 sheets of corrugated iron per month. At the same time, the Asia Factory, operated by the Japanese firm Kyufu Yoko, produces 70,000 sheets per month. In the past, the products of the Nakayama Factory were of poor quality. However, through experience, it was found that the water in the Wusong River contained too much alkali and was not suitable for manufacturing galvanized steel. Therefore, well water was used instead, and the quality of the products has now improved. The raw materials come from the Yawata Iron Works in Osaka and Kyushu. The raw materials of the Kyufu Factory come from the Showa Steel Works in Manchukuo. Kyufu and the Chinese factories sometimes engage in price competition. After Mr. Nakayama's visit to Shanghai, he formed a sales association with hardware merchants in Shanghai, attracting Chinese merchants and implementing a production and sales cooperation plan to defeat the Asia Factory and resolutely exclude British and American products in order to monopolize the market. In addition, the Central Machine Factory, organized by the Ministry of Industry of our country, will soon be able to produce machinery. Therefore, early dumping is being carried out to prevent the factory from promoting the dumping of its products. The expansion plan of the Nakayama Factory will include the expansion of the aluminum wire drawing factory, which is expected to produce 600 pieces per day. In the future, it will gradually expand to the point where it can supply the needs of the Yangtze River basin and various parts of South and Central China. As for tinplate (tinplate) for can making, it is expected to be manufactured and produced in Shanghai factories by June of next year. As for barbed wire (garden lead wire), the Japanese government stipulates that it is a military supply for war and must be permitted by the Ministry of the Army before it can be manufactured. Negotiations are still underway, and it will soon be on the market. The Shanghai Nakayama Factory has been open for a year now, and the speed of its development is astonishing and cannot be ignored. It will affect the position of the European and American markets in the Far East and sharply reduce customs import duties. In the future, glass products with higher import duties will also be manufactured locally by importing raw materials in the same way. The impact on our country's sharp reduction in customs duties and industrial invasion is a significant loss.</p>
<h3>Over 400 Chinese Laborers Expelled from Russia Returned to China Yesterday, Arriving in Shanghai</h3>
<p>**Some Had Participated in the European War; All Were in Dire Straits, Describing Their Plight; Authorities Are Arranging for Their Repatriation**</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, 402 Chinese laborers who had been living in Russia returned to China yesterday morning, arriving in Shanghai aboard the Russian postal ship "Northern." The Municipal Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau and the Public Security Bureau sent personnel to offer condolences and will arrange for their repatriation. These overseas Chinese, who had been living in Russia for a long time, were unkempt and shabbily dressed, appearing</p>
<p>in dire straits</p>
<p>as they described their plight. While in Russia, they engaged in extremely arduous lower-class work or small businesses. Some had participated in the European War of 1914. Amidst the current economic recession, Chinese laborers find it difficult to make a living overseas and have been forced to return home. According to the laborers, they suffered various forms of oppression and lived a hard life overseas. Now, unable to make a living, they have been</p>
<p>tragically expelled</p>
<p>and are returning home. Some had lived overseas for as long as forty or fifty years. Due to the hard work and low wages, they had no savings. The more than 400 people who arrived in Shanghai today had been scattered throughout Russia and traveled from Moscow via the Siberian Railway, boarding the ship in Vladivostok to return home. Upon departure, they were subjected to strict inspections, and any savings they had were confiscated. The laborers are from Hebei and Shandong provinces and speak the northern dialect. Currently, the Relief Section of the Second Division of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau are</p>
<p>temporarily housing</p>
<p>the laborers at the Jiangxi Guild Hall and conducting registration. According to those in charge, they will raise funds and arrange for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to repatriate them to their hometowns within days to avoid further displacement. The wealthiest of these laborers had only one or two hundred rubles each, and efforts will be made to exchange them for local currency.</p>

<p>China's trade with Italy primarily consists of lime, sesame seeds, and garlic. Imports from Italy mainly consist of rayon, olive oil, and other items. When sanctions were imposed on Italy, Sino-Italian trade completely stopped. After the sanctions were officially lifted on July 15th, trade between the two countries has gradually resumed. According to sources from export merchants, the Italian postal ship "Victoria" recently exported a large shipment of sesame seeds to Italy, totaling over 100 tons. This is the first batch of goods shipped to Italy after the lifting of the sanctions.</p>
<h3>Misunderstanding Regarding Revenue Stamps on Return Receipts; Chamber of Commerce Cables for Correction</h3>
<p>**No Need for Individual Stamp Duty by Recipients**</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting the correction of a misunderstanding in Guangdong province regarding the stamp duty on return receipts for goods delivered or money sent. Addressed to the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: We have recently seen the Guangzhou Seaport Chamber of Commerce Monthly, Volume 4, Number 5, published on June 15th of this year, which contains a letter from the Guangdong-Guangxi-Hunan Unified Tax Bureau to the Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce stating that the bureau had replied to the Guangzhou Bean Industry Association and the Railway Transportation Industry Association regarding the stamp duty on accounting documents for goods, stating that if the established stores had affixed sufficient stamp duty to the delivery or money receipt books according to regulations, there was no need for individual recipients to affix stamps. The letter inquired whether there was such an explicit statement. The bureau replied that it had not replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce explaining such events and had corrected this in various newspapers on September 4th, stating that for all books used to collect money or goods, in addition to the book cover being affixed with a two-cent stamp duty by the bookkeeper annually, each transaction within the book should be affixed with stamp duty by the recipient according to the tax rate for money and goods receipts listed in Item 2 of the tax rate table. It was requested that this be conveyed to the various industry associations and merchants to avoid misunderstandings. The Chamber of Commerce stated that this matter was reported to your ministry by the Jiangsu Acting Chamber of Commerce on September 3rd of last year, requesting instructions. On December 11th of the same year, the ministry issued approval number 8058, stating, "We have noted the Jiangsu Acting Chamber of Commerce's telegram of September. According to the law, stamp duty should be affixed to money or goods receipts by the issuer of the receipt. However, for convenience, if stores provide delivery or money receipt books for recipients to retain for verification or signing, and the established stores have affixed stamp duty to these delivery or money receipt books according to the regulations for books, there is no need for individual recipients to affix stamp duty again." This has already been complied with and recorded. However, the Guangzhou newspapers did not publish the full text and mistakenly attributed it to the Unified Tax Bureau's interpretation, causing the bureau to deny it and advocating for a position that deviates from the ministry's approval. This matter concerns the tax system and should have a uniform interpretation. Therefore, we are submitting the above-mentioned precedent and respectfully request your esteemed ministry to review and approve it and issue a telegram to the Guangdong provincial tax bureau to handle matters according to the above-mentioned approval to avoid discrepancies. This would be a public service. Respectfully submitted by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<h3>Huang Weiyuan of the Mei Li Company Returns from an Inspection Trip to the United States</h3>
<p>**American Grape Cultivation Practices**</p>
<p>According to Xinshengbao, Mr. Huang Weiyuan, the owner of Mei Li Dried Grape Company, the manager of the Kid Brand and Star Brand dried grapes, which are popular throughout the country, found that this product was beneficial for children during their confectionery years. However, as they were all imported by ship, there were shortcomings. Therefore, he departed for the United States last month to investigate the American grape cultivation practices. If possible, Mr. Huang has now returned to the country the day before yesterday. A reporter interviewed him, and Mr. Huang shared his experiences. Mr. Huang said, "I first went to Honolulu to inspect the pineapples there. Then I went to San Francisco, where the A. Dias Dried Grape Company is located, which is the company I have always traded with. Before this trip, I received a welcome telegram from the company. Upon arrival, I was greeted by company representatives, and Mr. Zhao Jiujie, a Cantonese speaker, was invited to be the interpreter. As the purpose of this trip was grapes, I took a flight to Fresno to visit the planting fields of two planting companies on both sides of the coast. The scale of this company is impressive. The area for planting grapes alone covers over 20,000 acres. I sat in a car and toured the grape fields. Everywhere I looked, there were green shades lining the roads. At that time, the grapes were just beginning to set. Clusters of grapes were everywhere. Workers were busy pruning. It is said that each tree is only allowed to bear about twenty clusters; otherwise, the development of the grapes will be hindered, and the grapes will not be large. The company authorities told me that grape cultivation is generally suitable for all types of soil, as long as it is cultivated using scientific methods, it can be successful. Although I don't know much about Chinese soil, it can probably be transplanted. They have already agreed to send me various grape seedlings in November for trial planting. Grapes are roughly divided into two types, green and red, and two categories, seeded and seedless, with seedless being better. The company produces about 160,000 tons of grapes annually, with 109,000 tons sold in the United States, 25,000 tons in Europe, and only 3,500 tons in the Far East. I also visited the oranges of the St. Canas Company, which are sold in China. Its scale is even larger than that on the West Coast. In addition, I visited the production of milk in San Francisco, etc."</p>
<h3>Fifth District Twenty Branch Party Congress: Appeal for Exemption from Land Excess Fees and for the Party to Consider the People's Property Rights, Requesting Government Officials to Treat People Kindly</h3>
<p>The Municipal Land Bureau, regarding the excess of privately-owned land, previously allowed temporary use, but now limits the payment of fees and promotion of classification. If a deficit is encountered, it will be a loss to the citizens without compensation, causing widespread public resentment. Currently, this is being clarified in the Pudong area. In order to protect the property rights of the citizens of this city, a special party congress was held to discuss this matter and petition the higher authorities to transfer it to the municipal government, requesting that in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code and the directives of the National Government, all excess land belonging to the people should be promoted to a higher classification free of charge. The petition stated: "We petition for the exemption of privately-owned land from promotion to a higher classification due to excess land, in order to alleviate the burden on the people and comply with the law. Since the land survey in this city, there have been frequent occurrences of excess land among privately-owned properties. According to the regulations of the Municipal Land Bureau, excess land must be promoted to a higher classification and fees must be paid. However, the majority of landowners are farmers, and at this time of rural bankruptcy, how can they have the surplus to pay for promotion and fees? Even in the industrial and commercial sectors, it is already difficult to make a living due to the economic downturn, so how can they take care of the land? The Municipal Land Bureau, without observing the people's sentiments, has strictly set the regulations for promoting excess land to a higher classification, forcing promotion and payment of fees within a time limit, and even requiring the payment of interest for overdue payments. Even if citizens voluntarily request the removal of excess land, it is not allowed. The handling of the promotion of excess land can be said to be strict. However, there are no remedial measures for deficit land. If excess land must be promoted and fees paid, then the land price should be returned for deficit land in order to be fair. In that case, even citizens whose land is promoted to a higher classification and fees paid will have no objection. But now, excess land must be promoted and fees paid, while no land price is returned for deficit land. The Municipal Land Bureau only knows the way to generate revenue, disregarding the losses of the citizens. Furthermore, if one person's land has an excess in parcel A and a deficit in parcel B, and the owner's name is the same, even though it is one person's land, the excess in parcel A must still be paid for promotion to a higher classification, causing citizens to suffer undeserved losses. It is no wonder that the citizens are resentful of the regulations set by the Municipal Land Bureau. Moreover, there are more difficulties in exchanging business licenses, such as discrepancies in strings and different numbers. It should be known that the land has not been cleared for hundreds of years, and errors are inevitable. Citizens only know that they have land, a certificate, and a string, and pay grain on time. How can they examine whether the numbers of the old grain string are accurate and consistent? Moreover, the transfer of land in the past was all handled by local bullies, who inevitably colluded and committed fraud, flying grain quotas east and west, twisting and complicating matters, making them impossible to investigate. The officials of the bureau often speak bureaucratic language, forcing citizens to investigate themselves and then exchange the licenses. Colleagues are also unwilling to inform them of the errors in detail, causing citizens to run back and forth, unable to resolve the matter, resulting in the promotion to a higher classification. This is even more unbearable for the citizens. Furthermore, Article 19 of the Outline for Handling Land Declarations issued by the Executive Yuan of the National Government under Instruction No. 3527 states, 'For all fields with land but no grain, or fields with more land than grain, no investigation will be made into the past, and all will be allowed to be promoted to a higher classification free of charge, without collecting supplementary grain or handling fees. Grain without land will be removed.' Article 28 states, 'For land without a deed, if it has been peacefully occupied for a long period of time and has been proven by the neighbors to comply with the provisions of the Civil Code, it will be handled in accordance with the provisions.' Furthermore, Article 769 of the Civil Code states that a person who has peacefully and continuously occupied unregistered real estate of another person for twenty years with the intention of ownership, and whose occupation began in good faith and without negligence, may request to be the owner. It can be seen that according to the law and the order, promotion to a higher classification can be free of charge, and no fees can be collected. However, the government's department violates the law, sets its own regulations, oppresses the citizens, and satisfies its desire to generate revenue, using the name of land survey to carry out the exploitation of the citizens. This branch is responsible for the burden of the citizens and for the land survey. Therefore, we propose the 120th Party Congress for discussion. The party has resolved to petition the higher authorities to transfer to the municipal government that all excess land should be allowed to be promoted to a higher classification free of charge in accordance with the National Government's instruction, and that no fees should be collected. Even land without a deed that complies with the provisions of the Civil Code should also be given a free promotion to a higher classification and issued a new certificate. The officials of the bureau should be instructed to treat the citizens with kindness in the future, and not to consider themselves as bureaucrats." This has been recorded and should be submitted to your association for review and forwarded to the municipal government to alleviate the burden on the people and comply with the law, which is truly beneficial to the party.</p>

<h3>Indian Convicted of Murder Sentenced to Hanging</h3>
<p>Umar Din, an Indian employee of the China Industrial Bank on Beijing Road, was found guilty of killing fellow Indian Fareed Buksh by hitting him with a heavy iron pipe on May 29th. He was arrested the next morning. After a preliminary hearing, he was handed over to the British High Court in China, where Judge Jones held several trials. The hearing was reopened a few days ago. Although the defendant's lawyer, Mr. Diamond, tried his best to defend him, claiming that the defendant was mentally disturbed when he committed the crime, and Dr. Lovenburg, a psychological expert, proved that the defendant had a simple mind and could not distinguish right from wrong, the prosecutor, Royal Attorney Mr. Pulaette-Wood, insisted that the defendant was not incapable of distinguishing right from wrong and had no confirmed history of mental illness. After the debate, the jury retired to consider for an hour, and then announced that the defendant was indeed guilty of murder. Judge Jones said that the jury's judgment was fair, and that those who shed the blood of others must have their blood shed in return, which is the justice of the law and cannot be refuted. Therefore, the defendant was sentenced to hanging. The defendant had hardly said a word since his arrest and remained calm as usual after hearing the verdict.</p>

<h3>Young Woman Married Unhappily, Became a Nun, Now Seeks Divorce</h3>
<p>Ye San'yuan, a young woman from Ningbo, 20 years old, married Fang Shunfa, a fellow villager from 41 Tiande Lane, Wuhua Road, Zhabei, in March of the 22nd year of the Republic. Unexpectedly, the marriage soon became unhappy, and the couple often quarreled, with no peace at home. Women are often narrow-minded and intolerant, and in the winter of the 23rd year, Ye San'yuan angrily went to Shouxing Nunnery at Bazihang Bridge in Ningbo and shaved her head to become a nun. Later, after mediation by relatives and friends, the status quo was temporarily maintained, and the couple no longer abused each other or ran away. Unexpectedly, after a few months, the couple had another conflict, and Ye San'yuan returned to her grandmother's house in Ningbo and did not return. When she came to Shanghai a few days ago, Fang Shunfa dragged his wife to the Yulin Road police station, accusing her of running away. The police station refused to handle the matter because it was a matter between husband and wife. Therefore, Ye San'yuan hired a lawyer and filed a petition requesting the local court to grant her a divorce and give her 1,000 yuan in alimony. Yesterday, Judge He Jingxian held a hearing. The defendant hired lawyer Wang Shou'an, who argued that his wife had run away and was not content with her home, and that becoming a nun was a pretense, so he did not want a divorce. The judge instructed that the case should be adjourned for further questioning of witnesses.</p>
<h3>The Funeral of Ms. Ding Shujing: More Than Ninety Telegrams of Condolence from Home and Abroad</h3>
<p>The funeral service for Ms. Ding Shujing, General Secretary of the National Association of the Young Women's Christian Association of China, was held at 4:00 PM yesterday at the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road. More than 200 people from the National Association of Young Men's Christian Associations and Young Women's Christian Associations, the Chinese Child Welfare Association, the Women's Temperance Union, the Shanghai Young Men's Christian Association and Young Women's Christian Association, the Foreign Young Men's Christian Association, and individuals such as Li Zhaohuan, Lu Ganchen, Liang Xiaochu, Wu Liande, Luo Yunyan, Mrs. Huang Xiufeng, Mrs. Niu Huisheng, and Ms. Hu Zhou Shu were present. A summary of the events is as follows:</p>
<p>The hall was decorated. In the center of the front of the hall was Ms. Ding's coffin, above which hung her portrait and a cross. On both sides were wreaths sent by Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Mrs. Kong Xiangxi, and others. On the left and right were relatives and colleagues from the Young Women's Christian Association. The hall was filled with mourners, and eulogies hung high on the four walls, creating a solemn atmosphere.</p>
<p>Brief Biography</p>
<p>After the mourning music stopped, Mrs. Huang Xiufeng, the chairwoman, gave the opening remarks. Mrs. Zheng Jingcheng was then appointed to recount Ms. Ding's life, stating that Ms. Ding was a native of Linqing County, Shandong Province, born on January 26th of the 25th year of the Guangxu reign. Her parents were Christians, and Ms. Ding was influenced by religion from a young age. When she grew up, she entered the Peking Union Women's College, where she was highly regarded by the famous educator Dr. Aimee Mead. Ms. Ding's life's interests were deeply influenced by Dr. Mac. She graduated one year before the founding of the Republic of China and taught at Bridgman Academy. She also founded the Peking Young Women's Christian Association and served as its general secretary for nine years. In the twelfth year, she came to Shanghai to prepare for the establishment of the National Association of Young Women's Christian Associations. She went to the United States to study that year and returned to China in the fifteenth year to serve as the general secretary of the National Association. In the nineteenth year, she was elected vice president of the World Young Women's Christian Association and attended many conferences in Europe and the United States, greatly raising the status of Chinese women internationally. Since Ms. Ding took office as the general secretary of the National Association, the Young Women's Christian Association movement in various places has developed day by day, which is due to Ms. Ding's planning and leadership. Ms. Ding loved to participate in all social undertakings and was hired as a director and executive committee member of more than a dozen groups. Her prestige was rare among our women. Just as she was at the peak of her career, there were many expectations. Unexpectedly, she passed away suddenly, and we cannot help but deeply regret and mourn her.</p>

Her vision and hard work were unique among our women. At this time of national crisis, Ms. Ding's death is a great loss to our country and nation. Recalling her great spirit, we cannot help but deeply feel that God has given us such a good model. We can only inherit Ms. Ding's legacy and continue to work hard. Then, the chairman read out telegrams of condolence from various places, including the World Young Women's Christian Association in New York, London, Japan, and other foreign Young Women's Christian Associations, and the Nanjing, Peking, Guangzhou, and other domestic Young Women's Christian Associations, the Yanjing University Alumni Association, and Chinese and foreign relatives and friends, totaling more than ninety telegrams.

The coffin slowly entered the tomb. Thus, the leader of this generation of young women will sleep forever under the green shade and fragrant grass.</p>
<h3>Yang Zhongfen Case Continued Hearing Yesterday: Accused of Seduction and Abandonment</h3>
<p>Wang Xingsheng Testifies to Past Medical Treatment; Two Key Witnesses Still Absent, Further Summons Required</p>
<p>Yang Zhongfen, a Fujianese secretary of the board of directors of the Zhongnan Bank, was recently sued in the First Special Court by Liu Huizhen, a 22-year-old Suzhou woman residing at 58 Xinxiude Lane, Baike Road, who hired lawyers Huang Xiubo and Feng Buqing, accusing him of seduction and abandonment of their biological son, Ali. She also filed a private suit, requesting payment of 20,000 yuan for living and educational expenses. This case has been repeatedly investigated by the court. Because the defendant Yang Zhongfen denied that Ali was his son, the court decided to send the plaintiff, defendant, and Ali to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for blood type identification and further verification of the circumstances, as reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the Special Court sent all the documents to the Zhenru Forensic Institute on the 7th of this month, requesting identification of whether Liu Huizhen's son, Ali, was born to Yang Zhongfen. The institute summoned all parties for detailed study and prepared an identification report, which was submitted to the court. According to the conclusion of the identification report, based on the blood type test results, Yang Zhongfen's blood type is O, and Liu Huizhen's blood type is also O. It is possible to have O-type children like Ali, but current science cannot determine that he is definitely his son. Therefore, on the afternoon of that day, this case was continued to be heard by Judge Zhong Qing in the Second Criminal Court. Key witnesses in the case, such as Dr. Zhou Huiying of the Kemei Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital and Mr. Wang, the landlord of No. 3 Hongxing Lane, Aiwengyi Road, failed to appear despite being summoned. Only Dr. Wang Xingsheng, whose address is 8 Baikefulu Lane, Xizang Road, complied with the summons to testify in the case. According to Dr. Wang's testimony, "I did not know the defendant Yang Zhongfen before. I met him through a friend, Da Jin Fengsheng. Since February of this year, Liu Huizhen came to see me with her son. The first time, Liu and Yang Zhongfen came together. At that time, Yang introduced Liu as his wife, so I wrote 'Mrs. Yang Zhongfen' and 'Yang Zhongfen's son' in the registration book. There were a total of four outpatient visits and four house calls. The consultation fees have not been paid yet." He then submitted the registration record as evidence. When questioned, Yang Zhongfen claimed, "Ali is definitely not my son. All the things Dr. Wang said are pure fabrications. I did have sexual intercourse with Liu Huizhen, but there was no birth." Liu Huizhen then brought her son Ali to the court and stated that the child was born on August 18th of the lunar calendar last year in Shengdali, Shengmuyuan Road, in the French Concession. Unexpectedly, the defendant had the evil intention of abandoning them at the end of last year, regardless of their livelihood. Since this year, he has disappeared without a trace, abandoning them. That is why I filed this lawsuit for my son and myself. "Judge Zhong said that the key witnesses in this case had not arrived today, so the trial could not be concluded, which was indeed hateful and there was a need for arrest warrants. Therefore, he instructed that the case be heard again on the afternoon of June 5th, and the witnesses should be summoned to appear in court.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Bus Company: Shelters Available at Some Bus Stops, Difficult to Provide at Every Stop</h3>
<p>Citizen Huang Yuzhai previously submitted a petition to the municipal government, requesting that the Shanghai Huashang Bus Company be ordered to build shelters from the wind and rain at bus stops, as reported in this newspaper. It is now heard that the company has reported to the Public Works Bureau that it is temporarily difficult to comply with the request. The company's report is excerpted as follows: "We received Instruction No. 3480 from your bureau, stating that the case of Huang Yuzhai's petition for the establishment of wind and rain shelters at bus stops has been ordered to be reviewed and reported. In response, the company has long had wind and rain shelters for the needs of passengers. For example, in the city center area, a bus shelter was built at a cost of several hundred yuan. At the Baoshan Road intersection, in addition to a wind and rain pavilion, a municipal house was rented there to provide passengers with a place to sit and wait for the bus. The Zhenru and Jiangwan lines also have bus shelters. It seems that Mr. Huang's request has not paid much attention to the company's bus routes. If every stop needs to be equipped with a wind and rain pavilion, the company's current four or five main lines are only eleven kilometers long, with more than twenty large and small stops, all of which are located adjacent to houses. If wind and rain pavilions are built everywhere, they will inevitably occupy the sidewalk, which is not allowed in reality. From this point of view, not only does this city not currently have this kind of equipment for foreign-owned electric vehicles running in the wilderness, but also the various countries in North America have not seen it. In addition, Mr. Huang's petition states that the time distance between the company's vehicles is as long as forty minutes, which is an exaggeration. According to the company's four or five vehicle regulations, a bus is scheduled to depart every nine minutes. If the two lines are combined, a bus departs every six minutes. Please forgive us if there are times when we are unable to do so due to human limitations or obstructions, such as interruptions in the railway gate. Therefore, it is temporarily difficult to comply with the point that the new urban area should be equipped with wind and rain stations everywhere. We hereby submit a report stating the reasons, requesting your review and reporting."</p>
<h3>Fountain Pen Lawsuit Over Engagement Keepsake: Judge Advises Reconciliation, Transforming Dispute into Gift</h3>
<p>Wang Weici, the wife of lawyer Yang Yuncong (who joined the Shanghai Bar Association in January of the 22nd year and practiced law in Shanghai, with his office located in the Traffic Bank Building on the Bund), a Wujin native residing at No. 12 Sanrang Lane, Caishi Road, French Concession, was a student at the Law and Politics University eight years ago, where she and Yang developed a friendship and then fell in love. Yang spent eight yuan to buy a fountain pen as a</p>
<p>engagement keepsake</p>
<p>for Wang. In January of this year, Wang's fountain pen was suddenly lost and could not be found. On April 3rd, Wang went to the home of her close friend Chen Zhou Shuzhen (the wife of Chen Qianli, the director of the Document Section of the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau, residing at No. 16 Yufu Lane, Baier Road, Nanyang Bridge) to play. On a whim, they jointly purchased an aviation lottery ticket, which Chen Zhou Shuzhen kept. Both parties intended to draft a document stating that if they won the lottery, they would divide the winnings equally, and they copied down the numbers on the lottery ticket. When Chen Zhou Shuzhen took out her fountain pen, Wang Weici realized that this pen was the item she had lost, an important engagement keepsake. She questioned Zhou about the origin of the pen, but Zhou's answer</p>
<p>raised doubts</p>
<p>and she refused to return it. Yang Wang Weici then filed a complaint with the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, requesting that Chen Zhou Shuzhen be ordered to return the lost fountain pen. Chen Zhou Shuzhen also hired a lawyer to defend herself. The initial trial ruled that the plaintiff's claim was dismissed. Yang Wang Weici refused to accept the decision and filed an appeal with the Third High Court. Yesterday at noon, Chief Judge Xia Quand, along with judges Tong Jishi and Liao Yan, presided over the hearing in the Fifth Court. The parties and their lawyers were present. The appellant Yang Wang Weici stated her reasons for appealing, saying that she did not accept the original judgment.</p>
<p>Reasons for Appeal</p>
<p>The appellee Chen Zhou Shuzhen stated that the fountain pen was given to her by her friend Mei Yingqian. The testimony of Mei Yingqian, who was summoned to the court, was the same as that of the appellee. At this point, Yang Yuncong, the appellant's husband, stated that he would withdraw from his position as the lawyer for the appellant and testify as a witness to prove that the fountain pen was indeed the appellant's. The appellant is the lawyer's wife, and the pen was personally purchased and given to the appellant by him eight years ago. Now that there is a dispute, it is for the sake of justice. The court, seeing that the</p>
<p>matter was minor, advised both parties to reconcile. He then asked Mei Yingqian, "Whether the fountain pen is yours or not, can you sacrifice it and give it to Yang Wang Weici to resolve the matter peacefully, so that you can remain friends?" Mei replied that a pen was a small matter, but she could not give it away for no reason. The court then said, "How about you give it to Chen Zhou Shuzhen, and she can then give it to Yang Wang Weici?" Mei immediately agreed. The court then asked both parties if they agreed, but Chen Zhou Shuzhen was still unwilling to agree. After repeated persuasion by the court, both parties finally agreed and</p>
<p>reached a settlement. A record was made, and the litigation costs were borne by each party. The parties, their lawyers, and the person concerned, Mei Yingqian, signed the record. The court then returned the fountain pen in evidence to the appellant to receive. After receiving the fountain pen, Yang Wang Weici and her husband, lawyer Yang Yuncong, left the courtroom smiling.

<p>Zengtaixiang Cigarette and Paper Shop at No. 570 Xinzha Road is accustomed to sending a shop assistant to the China Farmers Bank at No. 268 Beijing Road around 1:00 PM every day to exchange large amounts of five-yuan and ten-yuan banknotes for one-yuan banknotes. This had become a habit. Song Yulin, a Yangzhou native residing at No. 558, next door to the paper shop, learned of this and had malicious intentions. He invited four or five people, including Li Zhiyuan from Wuxi, to wait in front of the Farmers Bank. When the cigarette and paper shop assistant left the bank, they followed him to a secluded place to rob him. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, Jia Lusheng, an employee of the shop, went to the Farmers Bank to exchange 1,000 yuan for one-yuan banknotes. When he was near Zhifu Road near the Yunnan Road intersection, Li Zhiyuan and others stepped forward and hit Jia in the face several times, causing his nose to bleed. They knocked Jia to the ground and tried to rob the 1,000 yuan banknotes. However, Jia held on to the banknotes firmly and shouted loudly. Hua Constable No. 2489 heard the alarm and rushed to the scene to help chase after the robbers. Li Zhiyuan was arrested on the spot, and the others escaped. He was taken to the Laozha Police Station. After interrogation, it was learned that Song Yulin was the mastermind. Hua Detective Feng Xiushan and Detective Chen Ruisheng then arrested Song. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted them for robbery and stated the facts. After questioning by Judge Qian Hongye, he ordered that the hearing be adjourned to a later date.</p>

<h3>Hongwan King Qian Zupei Poisoning Case Concluded Hearing: Sentencing Scheduled for August 5th</h3>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled for August 5th</p>
<p>Qian Zupei, a Henan native known as the Hongwan King and also as Qian Guodong, nicknamed Xiaoshandong, was arrested by the French police in October of the 21st year of the Republic after private vendors Shi Yinbao and Wang Gensheng confessed and was handed over to the Second Special Court. During the investigation, he paid 8,000 yuan in cash bail and was released to await trial. Unexpectedly, Qian fled in fear of punishment three days after being released on bail. The court sentenced Shi and Wang to prison separately, confiscated Qian's 8,000 yuan bail, and issued an arrest warrant ordering his arrest. After half a year, Qian, believing that the situation had calmed down, sneaked back to Shanghai and hid in the Public Concession. The French police discovered his presence and, together with the Laozha police, arrested Qian at the Central Teahouse at No. 90 Guangxi Road and extradited him to the Second Special Court for investigation. The details have been reported in this newspaper many times. This case was continued to be heard by Judge Zhang Chaozuo of the Second Special Court in the First Criminal Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Yao Zhaodi stated the facts of the case and filed a public prosecution according to law, requesting severe punishment. Qian Zupei denied selling Hongwan, claiming that he received a letter from home after being released on bail, stating that his mother was critically ill, so he returned to his hometown and was not fleeing in fear of punishment. He also claimed that he did not know Shi Yinbao, Lu Changfa, and others. When asked why he was willing to sacrifice 8,000 yuan after being released on bail, he replied that he had seen in the newspaper that the 8,000 yuan had already been confiscated and could not be recovered, so he did not surrender. The court, seeing that the facts of the case were clear, ordered the debate to be opened. After the police lawyer and the defendant's defense lawyer, Xu Heling, debated with each other, the court declared the debate closed and scheduled the sentencing for August 5th. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Zhang Pi and a Dancer: Adultery Case May Be Resolved Amicably</h3>
<p>Zhang Xipi, a student at Great China University from Hangzhou, became involved with Qian Wenying, a female student from Songjiang, while still in school. They officially became engaged in Songjiang on July 30th of last year and held their wedding ceremony the following day, after which they cohabited at No. 150 Pingmin Village, Qimei Road, Shanghai. Recently, Qian Wenying discovered that her husband, Zhang Xipi, was having an affair with Jiang Ailing (also known as Li Xingxian), a dancer at the Yangtze Dance Hall, and had been engaging in adultery in Room 166 of the Sutai Hotel on Fuzhou Road. She reported this to the police, who dispatched detectives to apprehend Zhang Xipi and Li Xingxian and bring them to the First Special District Court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Coal Foreman Stoned to Death; Assailant Fled; Motive Unknown</h3>
<p>Wen Sanzi, a 40-year-old from Jiangbei, residing in Pudong, Shanghai, worked as a coal-carrying foreman at the Zhanghuabang Railway Wharf in Wusong. The day before yesterday, Wen Sanzi, having learned of a coal-carrying ship arriving in Wusong, specially arranged for his companions to work in Wusong. Due to the hot weather, they slept on the wharf that night. At around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, before dawn, Wen Sanzi was struck in the head with a large rock while asleep. Wen Sanzi awoke in extreme pain, but the assailant had already fled without a trace. Suffering severe injuries, his companions carried him to the hygiene hospital, but his condition was already critical, and the hospital refused to admit him. After being carried back to the wharf, he died. The local bailiff reported this to the local court, and Prosecutor Xiao and coroner arrived for inspection. The body has been claimed by relatives and placed in a coffin.</p>
<p>The two defendants were each released on bail of 500 yuan pending trial. Li Xingxian has already been released on bail, but Zhang remains in custody due to lack of bail. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce again interrogated the case and asked Qian Wenying if she had brought the marriage certificate from the previous hearing. Qian replied that she had not returned to her hometown to retrieve it because there was hope for an amicable resolution. Her attorney, Fan Gang, requested a postponement so that both parties could attempt an amicable resolution out of court to avoid a complete breakdown. The court ordered Li Xingxian to remain on her original bail, and Zhang Xipi's bail was reduced by 100 yuan. Before providing a bail bond, he was allowed to have his defense attorney, Chen Mao Xuan, vouch for his release.</p>
<h3>Two More Rickshaws Stolen; Rickshaw Theft King Zhou Bugen Arrested</h3>
<p>Zhou Bugen, the notorious "Rickshaw Theft King" of Zhabei, has habitually made a living by stealing rickshaws for ransom. Since the formation of the Rickshaw Merchants' "No Ransom" Association in the Chinese area, Zhou Bugen has changed his tactics, sending his followers to various parking areas in the concessions to steal rickshaws. He demands 15 yuan per rickshaw from the merchants for their return. This has been quite successful for several months. On the afternoon of the 28th of this month at 6:00 PM, a concession rickshaw numbered 3137 was stolen while the driver, Shen Yulou, was momentarily careless at the New Garbage Bridge. Zhang and Yan contacted the driver, saying that the rickshaw was with Zhou Bugen and required 15 yuan to redeem. The driver pawned belongings and borrowed money, raising 12 yuan but still lacking 3 yuan. He requested the rickshaw owner to make up the difference in order to redeem the rickshaw. Upon learning of this, the rickshaw owner, Cha Shiguan, reported the incident to the Xinzha Detective Squad, requesting an investigation and arrest to protect the rickshaw industry. At approximately 7:00 PM last night, the Detective Squad, led by Foreman Li Shouchun and detectives Xiao Huaiyu, along with informants Zhang and Yan, rushed to the Zhongxing Bathhouse on Zhongxing Road and arrested Zhou Bugen. After questioning him, they transferred the suspect and witnesses to the Xinzha Sub-bureau for further investigation.</p>
<p>Rickshaw puller Xu Wenlou, 20 years old, from Taizhou, came to Shanghai last autumn with his father and brother, seeking a livelihood, and resided with a fellow villager surnamed Tang at No. 3, Lane 94, Pig-Making Alley, Xiaonanmen. The father swept garbage, while the two brothers pulled rickshaws to make a meager living. Yesterday afternoon, at approximately 2:00 PM, while Xu Wenlou was waiting for passengers near the Guan Bridge in the 16th Section with his city-registered rickshaw No. 4077, he agreed on a fare of 300 cash with a passenger to pull them to the Xie Bridge. When he returned to fetch the rickshaw to pick up the passenger, it was gone. He immediately reported this to the nearby police post No. 4524, but to no avail. The father and sons lamented together. Even if the original rickshaw is found, it is unlikely that all the rubber attachments will be complete. According to the "No Ransom" Association's rules, they would have to compensate at least 3 yuan. In this time of economic depression, even raising 3 yuan is difficult, so they are very anxious all day.</p>

<h3>Selling Hunting Rifles to Defraud; Many Deceived, Especially People from Other Regions; Zhang Wenwei and Others Sentenced to Fines</h3>
<p>Zhang Wenwei, Wang Tongsheng (also known as Wang Xu), Wang Xihua, and others previously opened the Central Company in the rear room of the Jianhua Bookstore at No. 40 Jiaotong Road, specializing in selling hunting rifles, radios, etc., and exaggerating their effectiveness in advertisements and leaflets. However, they did not sell in stores, only through mail orders. Many people from other regions made purchases. The hunting rifles sold by the company were actually modified air rifles, with an original cost of only 3 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen, but a selling price of 9 yuan 5 jiao. The original cost of the radios was only about 2 yuan, but the selling price was 4 yuan 6 jiao. Recently, it was reported by the post office to the Hongkou police station that remittance of purchase money from other regions had been fraudulently collected by people forging stamps. After an investigation by Chinese Detective Huang Fusen and others, it was determined that the company was suspected of fraud. As they prepared to proceed according to the law, the Central Company had already heard the news and relocated. Subsequently, Huang Detectives managed to apprehend Zhang, Wang, and Wang and confiscated 105 radios and 11 hunting rifles. They were handed over to the First Special District Court, and each was granted bail of 2,000 yuan. Zhou Zhongfan, a Major General of the Army from Deping County, Shandong Province, wrote to the Shanghai Municipal Government, accusing the company of fraudulent behavior, stating that many people in the county had ordered hunting rifles from the company and remitted thousands of yuan. He requested an investigation and handling. The Municipal Government then sent the case to the Public Security Bureau, ordering officials to investigate and confirm the facts, and then requested the police to prosecute. Therefore, the police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, filed a lawsuit in accordance with the criminal law for fraud. Yesterday morning, Judge Chuan Lin opened the 5th Criminal Court for trial. During the debate, the police lawyer stated that similar incidents were numerous, so he hoped that the facts of this case would be publicized to prevent people from other regions from being deceived again. The defendants also hired attorneys such as Fan Gang to defend them. After hearing the case, Judge Chuan declared the verdict: Zhang Wenwei, Wang Tongsheng, and Wang Xihua were jointly convicted of obtaining illegal profits by fraud, and each was fined 200 yuan. The 105 radios and 11 hunting rifles were confiscated.</p>

<h3>Merchant Corps Chinese Team Continues to Win Japan Cup</h3>
<p>The Chinese team of the Shanghai International Merchant Corps recently won the All-Corps Efficiency Shield for this year, as reported in the newspapers. It has now been learned that the team was awarded the most difficult-to-win Japan Silver Cup of the Corps, according to Headquarters Order No. 30. The news is exciting. It is said that the cup is a trophy specially presented by Japanese merchant groups in Shanghai to the team with the best overall performance throughout the year. The competition is extremely complex and includes military discipline and decorum. Therefore, winning the cup is not only a victory for the entire corps, but also earns the honor of wearing a special white feather badge on the military cap. The Chinese team won the cup once in the second year of the competition. In the past two years, they have won twice in a row. This decision to continue to maintain this victory is the fourth time in a row.

<h3>Deep-Seated Grudges Between Two Neighbors; Beijing Street Brawl Turns Bloody; Both Chen Along and Li Sandou Severely Injured; Interrogation to Resume After Both Recover</h3>
<p>Chen Su, a woman residing at No. 86 Xihua Road with her son A Long, has had a long-standing feud with Wang Yongqing, a resident of No. 107 (across the street), Pudong, who sells bean sprouts. A month ago, Wang parked a small bean sprout cart in front of Mrs. Chen's back door, and Mrs. Chen accidentally knocked it over, leading to a quarrel. At 3:15 PM the day before yesterday, Mrs. Chen discarded crab shells at Wang's doorstep, which was witnessed by his assistant, Li Sandou, from Qingpu, and Wang, who believed that Mrs. Chen had done this intentionally, leading to another argument. Neither side would back down. Mrs. Chen was struck on the head and injured. Her son, A Long, returned home and, upon learning of this, became enraged. Both sides gathered many friends and, armed with axes and sharp knives, engaged in a brawl. As a result, A Long suffered axe wounds to his head, legs, and feet, while Li Sandou suffered a knife wound to the abdomen. Both collapsed to the ground, crying in pain and bleeding profusely. Huishan Police Detective Cui Chengke arrived at the scene after hearing the commotion and made arrests. The accomplices fled in a panic. Chen Along and Li Sandou were taken to the police station. The police chief arranged for the two injured to be taken to Tongren and Police hospitals for treatment. It is said that Li's injuries are quite serious and may be life-threatening. Yesterday morning, the case was presented to the 3rd Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Attorney Zhang Shizhu of the Public Works Department described the incident and requested a postponement, pending the recovery of the injuries, before resuming the interrogation. Judge Xiao Xiefen approved the request.</p>
<h3>Physician Wang Daoren Accused of Medicating Person to Death; Huang Heiwan Pills Cause Tremors After Consumption; Whole Body Turns Purple, Blood Flows from Mouth and Nose — Zheng Dianqiu Dies a Tragic Death</h3>
<p>Wang Daoren, a physician at the Jianhua Electrotherapy Hospital at No. 13 Nianwu New Village, Fuxu Road, was recently accused by Zheng Kewen, the owner of the New Era Dance Research Society at the intersection of Aidao Road and Danshui Road, and his mother, Zheng Pan, both from Hubei, in a lawsuit filed by their attorney at the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, for posing as a doctor and medicating a person to death, and attaching a civil suit. The case stems from the fact that Zheng Pan's son, Dianqiu, 21 years old, suddenly suffered from diarrhea on the 6th of this month. The defendant, Wang Daoren, frequented Zheng Kewen's New Era Dance Research Society and claimed to be a hospital doctor. Upon learning that Dianqiu was ill, he volunteered his services, claiming that he could cure him with one medicine. On the 9th, he gave Dianqiu two kinds of pills, Huang Heiwan, instructing him to swallow them in the morning and evening. On the morning of the 10th, after swallowing fifteen pills, he felt unwell and could not get out of bed, his hands and feet twitching. That night, he swallowed the pills again, but unexpectedly, his whole body trembled, his breathing became weak, and he could not speak. He was rushed to the Chinese Hospital, where Dr. Yang diagnosed him as being beyond help. Even with a heart stimulant shot, it was ineffective. He was urgently sent to the Public Works Department Hospital, but died before treatment. The corpse appeared purple, and blood flowed from the mouth and nose, obviously signs of poisoning. The police were notified to inspect the body at the First Special District Court. Because an autopsy was required, the Zheng family could not bear it, so the body is still at the mortuary. In addition to requesting a re-examination, they are requesting that the defendant be charged with murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law, and attaching a civil suit, etc. Yesterday afternoon, at around 1:00 PM, Judge Tan Xinzhen presided over the 8th Criminal Court for interrogation. The defendant hired Attorney Sun Shi'an to appear in court for defense. After a brief interrogation of the plaintiff and defendant, the court ordered a postponement for further interrogation, with the defendant posting a 500 yuan bail bond.</p>

Lu was taken to the hospital for treatment, and the Public Security Bureau was notified to arrest the perpetrators. Fortunately, Lu's injuries were not deep, and his life is not in danger. The Central Trust Bureau is Reorganizing the Sino-French Savings Society</p>
<h3>Fixed-Term Savings Terminated</h3>
<p>Since taking over the Sino-French Savings Society, the Central Trust Bureau has done its utmost to protect the interests of depositors. Depositors who request to exchange their old Sino-French Savings Society certificates for new Central Savings Society certificates not only suffer no loss but also enjoy better lottery rights than those of the Sino-French certificates. Therefore, many old depositors of the Sino-French Savings Society have exchanged their certificates and continued to save with the Bureau. It has been learned that the Bureau has been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to expedite the completion of this reorganization procedure. Therefore, August 31 of this year has been set as the deadline, and a notice has been published in major ports in late June to notify depositors that applications will no longer be accepted after the deadline.</p>
<h3>Zheng Shouchun Accused of Seducing Actress; Plaintiff and Daughter Fail to Appear; Zheng Shouchun Describes the Course of Their Relationship</h3>
<p>Zheng Shouchun, from Hebei, recently filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court accusing Tang Haiqing, a fellow villager residing at No. 88 Cai Gong Residence, Pudong, of seducing his daughter, Zheng Xiaoxiu (an actress performing Hebei opera, then 17 years old), into fornication in 1934. He requested that Tang be punished accordingly and ordered to pay compensation totaling 34,520 yuan in national currency. Yesterday morning, the case was heard by Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zheng Shouchun and Zheng Xiaoxiu were said to have gone to Hankou and did not appear in court. The defendant, Tang Haiqing, appeared in court with his defense attorney, Song Yuntao. Tang stated that Zheng Xiaoxiu was originally an actress who then engaged in prostitution. In the autumn of 1934, she was introduced by a friend and summoned to the Huishan Hotel. Later, a relationship developed at the Gongping Hotel. At that time, Zheng Xiaoxiu claimed to be 22 years old, with no parents, living alone in Shanghai, and struggling to make a living. He asked for his help. In September, he rented a room for Xiaoxiu above Zhou Faji's fruit shop on Penglu Road. They lived together for a short time and then moved to No. 8 Yidun Lane, Guangxin Road, Yangshupu. He gave her 40 yuan per month for living expenses. Later, Zheng asked to move back to his home. After discussing with his wife and obtaining her consent, they moved to his house. However, she was not accustomed to rural life. In February of this year, she suddenly claimed that her father had died and she needed to return home immediately. She asked him for 80 yuan. He questioned her, saying that she had said she had no father, so why was her father suddenly dead? She claimed that she had lied to him at the beginning. He gave her 70 yuan in foreign currency. However, in less than two days, Zheng suddenly sent someone to tell him to go to Yishun Lane, saying that she had already sent the money to her village and would not be returning. Last month, due to differences, they signed a separation agreement at Attorney Song Yuntao's office, and he gave her 350 yuan in foreign currency. Now she is suddenly filing a lawsuit, perhaps because she suspects that he has money. Judge Qian stated that the plaintiff had not arrived today and needed to be summoned again, and postponed the hearing for one week.</p>
<h3>Two Major Fires in Zhabei, Tanzhiwan, Haichang Road on the Night Before Last and This Morning; 31 Rooms and Sheds Burned; Losses of 70,000 to 80,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>(Tanzhiwan) Behind the former police station in Tanzhiwan, Zhabei, along the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, is No. 514, a row of tiled bungalows owned by the Japanese merchant Wuben and others, where the Jiangnan Leather Factory has been operating for more than ten years and has been very successful. For some unknown reason, a fire suddenly broke out at the factory at 11:20 PM the night before last. The Tanzhiwan police station immediately contacted the fire department and dispatched hoses to the scene, while also reporting to the Xinzha Sub-bureau. Bureau Chief Liao Jiong Ran personally led patrol officers and police to rush to the scene to maintain order. However, the fire was fierce, and it was not extinguished until zero o'clock yesterday morning. After the investigation, it was learned that the factory had not been operating at night recently due to the hot weather, and there were only one or two assistants guarding the factory, so the cause of the fire is unknown. Yesterday morning, Chief Liao sent household registration patrol officer Li Changgeng to re-survey the scene and found that a total of 12 bungalows had been destroyed. According to factory personnel, the loss is estimated at 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Fortunately, they had fire insurance of 63,000 yuan with Dachang and other insurance companies. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation.</p>
<p>Haichang Road, Intersection of Haichang Road and Gonghe New Road, No. 277 Lane, i.e. Wanyuan Lane) There were more than 20 thatched sheds. At about 1:30 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the thatched sheds. The fire department was alerted and dispatched vehicles to the scene to extinguish the fire. By the time it was extinguished, a total of 19 thatched sheds had been destroyed. The Xinzha Sub-bureau dispatched police to investigate and arrested Guo Qian, a 64-year-old woman from Gaoyou, suspected of starting the fire. Her husband, Guo Hongyuan, 62 years old, originally had a cobbler stall in front of the Buddhist Laymen's Forest on Xinmin Road, but now collects waste paper due to old age. It was also learned that the thatched sheds were surrounded by tiled bungalows, and none were affected, which was fortunate.</p>

<h3>National Trade Standardization and National Psychological Construction - Xu Xiaochu</h3>
<p>July 28th, broadcasted from the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau's broadcasting station, the following is the speech on promoting domestic products. Listeners, the topic I'm addressing today seems a bit too broad. In a brief twenty minutes, it's naturally difficult to cover everything in detail. However, based on my personal observations, I believe that whether it's for domestic product manufacturers or consumers, from the perspective of promoting domestic goods, this topic is indeed worth raising for discussion among our countrymen. Therefore, I have specifically generalized it for everyone to study.</p>
<p>In recent years, domestic industry and commerce have indeed made much progress compared to the past, thanks to various promotions and advancements. However, inquiring from the domestic product manufacturers themselves, not only are ordinary light industries secretly crying out in pain, but even large factories with considerable history and foundation are teetering on the brink of collapse, almost beyond redemption. The gloomy clouds of economic recession pervade the globe, and our country is naturally no exception. The decline of the industrial sector is certainly one of the reasons, but the inability of domestic products to compete with the dumping of foreign goods is indeed the biggest reason. Speaking of this, it is naturally complicated, but the lack of standardization of domestic products is a common problem. The goods we need are not made domestically. Naturally, the market is monopolized by foreign goods. However, even when we already have domestic products, we still cannot curb the rampant spread of foreign goods. Upon closer examination, the majority of cases are due to competition among businesses, leading to shoddy workmanship and inferior products, and price reductions to seek sales. The manufacturers themselves wear a pair of short-sighted glasses, abandoning the fundamentals and pursuing the superficial, engaging in mutual destruction, and ultimately perishing together, which is certainly deserved. However, on the part of those who love to use domestic products, they often become discouraged as a result of repeated disappointments. The failure of domestic products is largely due to this reason. The above refers specifically to the domestic situation. If we look at it from the perspective of international trade, it would be even worse. Either the products are crude and not worth a look, or they start out fine but then each batch is different, inconsistent in quality, causing friends to frown and giving enemies opportunities. Once the credibility of domestic products is lost, even if there are better goods in the future, developing abroad will inevitably suffer a major impact. Because one example leads to a hundred, which is the usual psychology of humans. Therefore, rather than promoting crude products abroad, causing all domestic products to be looked down upon and becoming a sinner in the domestic product industry, it's better not to do it. Speaking of this, some people advocate quickly finding ways to control the industry, increase the power of trade associations, in order to correct this bad phenomenon, which is certainly within their duties. However, no matter what method is adopted, we must pay attention to the standardization of goods, so that everyone loves to use them and is happy to promote them, that is the most important method. For example, foreign thermos bottles sell for three or five yuan each, and people still prefer to use them. On the other hand, domestic products are sold cheaply for fifty cents each, but they get the criticism of "absolutely no good products." The majority of thermos bottle factories cannot maintain themselves, which is also due to this reason. As the saying goes: you get what you pay for. Foreign goods are sold at higher prices, but they gain the trust of society. Therefore, there have been cases where genuine domestic products are disguised as foreign products. Therefore, our domestic product manufacturers should know to strive for perfection, and should not only know to produce shoddy goods and inferior products, and compete on price. They should know that the reputation of old brands is the reason why they can sell at high prices. Business development does not necessarily lie in constant price cuts. This is something that our domestic product manufacturing industry should be aware of today.</p>
<p>In addition, related to "standardization," we should also pay attention to the advancement of the times and the preferences of society, to use as the object of manufacturing products. It is heard that a certain cloth factory in the neighboring country, before promoting to the South Seas Islands, specially sent many employees to conduct on-site investigations, to understand the customs and preferences of the people there. In each place, they stood at the intersection of major roads for three consecutive days, observing the patterns and colors of the clothing of the people passing by, recording them and making statistics, in order to see the general preferences of the people in each place, and used this as the standard for weaving cloth. Therefore, when transported for sale, they were welcomed everywhere. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Continued Efforts in Children's Training - Zhu Chun</h3>
<p>Today is the day of the closing ceremony of Children's Year in Shanghai. Under this grand ceremony, we should examine why the government is raising the status of children and paying attention to children's happiness. This is very clear, because children are the basic team for the revival of the nation, so our forging of children's bodies, cultivating their intelligence, and cultivating their morality are all major issues of children's happiness. Further, it is the entire composition of a nation. If all the members are physically weak, intellectually backward, and morally degraded, then self-destruction is an inevitable result.</p>
<p>The Chinese nation has a history of four to five thousand years and is one of the most outstanding nations in the world. Now, it has been subjected to the oppression and humiliation of imperialism, and the day is near when the glorious history of our nation will be buried. What is the reason for this? This is the result of burying children's happiness under the poisonous flames of the imperial examination policy and the oppression of ethnic discrimination by alien races who took over China. To break the national crisis, burn the shackles on our heads, and thoroughly transform society, the first thing we need is, of course, to train children;</p>
<p>The main issue in training children: to make them clearly recognize the current environment of individuals, countries, and the nation; and further to make them take the responsibility of breaking the bad environment! But training children is by no means a short-term task, and it is by no means possible to complete their tasks within the one-year period of "Children's Year". As the saying goes, "It takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to nurture people." We know that the Children's Year of the past week was only to promote the attention of people in society to children's happiness and the beginning of training children.</p>
<p>From now on, we must continue to work hard for the cause of children's happiness. Expand it to the whole society. From a small number of children, start to a large number of children, from educated children, spread to poor and out-of-school children, so that all children included in the entire nation have a healthy body, a quick mind, and a superior morality, to lay a solid foundation for our national revival and wash away the shame in the history of our Chinese nation!</p>
<p>At present, all civilized countries in the world are doing their best to promote the cause of children's happiness. Especially in countries such as the Soviet Union, Germany, and Japan, they are all striving to promote the training of children, so their roars are gradually going to shake the world. We should be cautious before the fact and afraid of the consequences, to defend the survival of the nation, we should not abandon the training of children!</p>
<p>Children's Year has passed. We hope that the permanent organization of the Children's Affairs Committee will further develop its responsibilities!</p>
<h3>How Should Modern Society Pay Attention to the Education of Children? - Zhang Hui</h3>
<p>Time flies, Children's Year is over. During this year, what is the effect of the implementation of children's happiness? There is public opinion on its own; but how should modern society pay attention to children's issues? I must speak to the people of society again!</p>
<p>Looking back at past society, children were mostly subjected to destruction. Village elders or parents held the power of life and death. For example, in some parts of India, parents could kill their children at will. Japan used girls to sacrifice to beast gods. China also had customs of sacrificing children to bridges. Since the appearance of Froebel in the nineteenth century, people began to pay attention to children, although corporal punishment was abolished and attention was paid to influencing through moral persuasion, but it was too lenient and had superstitious elements. And when Montessori appeared in the twentieth century, she took children as the center and freedom as the purpose of education, but it was too focused on theory. Later, psychology surged, and there was no shortage of people studying children's learning. Therefore, the research on children's issues spread from all over Europe to America, from personal advocacy to national sponsorship, and from exhortation to practical facilities. In recent years, our country's exploration of children's issues has also advanced rapidly. The establishment of Children's Year is nothing more than to awaken the people of the country to have more practical attention.</p>
<p>However, why has the issue of children attracted such attention in modern society? Because modern society is a dynamic phenomenon. Its culture is due to the creation of mankind, and today's adults are the children of the past, and today's children are the adults of the future, that is, the pillars of future society. Therefore, the rise and fall of a nation, the prosperity of a country, and the success or failure of a cause should certainly be viewed in terms of the efforts and responsibilities of modern people. However, if we want society to improve day by day and progress continuously, we must pay attention to modern adults, but we must also pay attention to children! Those who fail must rely on this generation to recover, and those who succeed must also rely on this generation to promote them! In the past, Bismarck attributed the Franco-Prussian War to the way children were educated, which is trustworthy! Therefore, modern society should educate children based on the grand plan of nurturing people for a hundred years, and guide them patiently, so that elites can emerge and we can achieve twice the result with half the effort! Not only that, children have the greatest flexibility, and children have their own nature. If children are educated with adult opinions, it is tantamount to destroying children. Whether they are parents in the family or teachers in the school, they should follow the interests of children and teach them all the knowledge and skills that are needed by today's society.</p>
<p>Since the relationship between children and society is so close, and the education of children is so complex, how can modern society ignore the education of children? Now that Children's Year is over; I hope that people in society should pay attention to the issue of children's education!</p>
<h3>The Responsibilities that Modern Parents Should Bear for Their Children - Zhang Huibing</h3>
<p>Children are the masters of future society. If we want to consolidate the foundation of future society, we must pay attention to the issue of children, and at the same time we must pay attention to the issue of parents; because there are modern children, and modern parents are indispensable. Only with modern parents can there be modern children.</p>
<p>Children are the foundation of society. Then, parents should fulfill the duty of educating their children, so that their children become good citizens. Parents who do this can be considered modern parents. However, it is not yet complete. Because in ancient times, people's livelihood was simple and knowledge was shallow, it was easy for parents to fulfill the duty of education. Today, the branches of knowledge are becoming more complex, and the techniques of lifting buckets are becoming more specialized. It is impossible for parents to be well-versed in all of them, and they are also busy with their careers, and they do not have the leisurely time to educate their children. Then, parents can hand over their children to society to fulfill the responsibilities of modern parents. However, it is still not complete. Then, what responsibilities should modern parents bear for their children? As far as I can see, I will try to say the following:</p>
<p>A. Regarding the children:</p>
<p>(1) Be responsible for providing preparatory education. Children inevitably have to separate from their parents, but they cannot completely separate from their parents. Therefore, when parents are close to their children, they should provide preparatory education at any time and any place, to lay the foundation for future formal education.</p>
<p>(2) Be responsible for providing supplementary education. After children receive formal school education, parents should still provide supplementary education at any time and any place, to assist with the difficulties and shortcomings of school education.</p>
<p>B. Regarding oneself:</p>
<p>(1) Should understand children's psychology. Children's personalities are the strongest and the most flexible in childhood. They are inquisitive and like to play. Parents should follow the psychology of children and guide them patiently to put them on the right track. They must not treat them arbitrarily with the attitude of adults.</p>
<p>(2) Should understand the social situation. Parents should not only understand the psychology of children, but also have a considerable understanding of the problems needed by modern society and the urgent problems of current survival. In this way, children can be made into useful adults, adults who are beneficial to mankind, and masters who can adapt to modern society! Modern parents who can possess the above items are not only the happiness of modern children, but also the glory of the nation. I hope that modern parents will pay attention to them!</p>

<p>Reflections on the Closing of Children's Year, Shao Mingjiu</p>
<p>To talk about the course of Children's Year, it is absolutely impossible to express in a few words. The personal feelings I have gained cannot be completely described hastily. Now that Children's Year has reached its conclusion, I feel compelled to say a few words. Although Children's Year is coming to an end, children's affairs are not ending with it. It is just the form of Children's Year that is temporarily coming to a conclusion. I think this Children's Year, in the beginning, was so well-planned and organized. From the central government down to the administrative organs of each province and city, all bore significant responsibility and held great hope in carrying out this unprecedented Children's Year ceremony. In terms of formality, it can be said that everything was available, such as the establishment of a Children's Year Implementation Committee. The organization of this committee, in addition to the administrative authorities being ex-officio members, also involved inviting experts to take on the work. Looking at the situation in this way, the organization was considered strict, and the planned work was probably not small. However, in the end, the organization remained an organization, and the plan remained a plan. I dare say that its achievements were the most unpleasant. This Children's Year was fully implemented for a year. We need to think about how, throughout this year, not to mention the people who undertook the work and used countless brainpower, the central and local governments probably spent no small amount of funds. Summed up nationwide, this figure is naturally in the tens of thousands or more. In my opinion, the publicity work for children, although the time has passed, has not stopped paying attention to the facts. I think we should still brace ourselves, continue to work practically. Speaking of this, I can't help but mention my personal experience in promoting children's affairs.</p>
<p>On August 1, 1934, I started the China Children's Products Company in Shanghai, the national cultural center. Although no results have been seen yet, I feel in my conscience that the things I should do are already known to people at home and abroad. Therefore, I am still continuing to move forward and will never express passivity. In 1932, when I was in the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, serving as a school administrative inspector, I had more opportunities to come into contact with primary schools. The school supplies I saw in each school were all crude, and most of them did not conform to the principles of education, economics, and hygiene. How could I even talk about my own creations? Even if there were any, they were truly rare. How could such a situation not make me anxious? At the same time, around the January 28th Incident, in order to write my book "Local Education Administration," I had to investigate practical materials from various provinces and cities, especially focusing on the content of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and paying attention to the best primary schools in these two provinces. After two or three years, I discovered the most serious problem in primary schools, which was the extreme lack of children's supplies. This was also a problem that should be paid attention to most by children across the country. Therefore, we all talk about working for the welfare of children, so how can we not put this most important thing into practice? I have also investigated the work of social undertakings, and I am afraid that nothing is more important than this. Finally, I was still stimulated by my conscience. Why do Chinese children not have Chinese-made supplies? So, I made a great determination and felt that I had to take on this responsibility temporarily. This is the origin of my advocacy for the China Children's Products Company.</p>
<p>(Note) (1) Currently, the children's supplies found in China are either aristocratic or Westernized. Most of what is seen on the market is commercialized rather than educational. The damage this has on children's physical and mental health is truly profound. (2) The organizational law of the China Children's Products Company that I am advocating will be compiled into a separate publication. Therefore, what is mentioned in this article is only the motivation.</p>
<p>School News</p>
<p>Zhizhong Girls' Middle School: 186 Nanyang Road, Xiaoshadu Road Intersection. Zhizhong Girls' Middle School has been established for three years. Since moving into the new school building, the flowers and trees have been luxuriant, and the gardens are excellent. As a result, the number of students has increased daily. Yesterday was the school's enrollment examination date. A total of 48 junior high school students, including Qiu Xinhe, and 51 senior high school students, including Han Xinfang, were admitted. It is heard that the school's second enrollment period is scheduled for August 25th.</p>

<h3>Urban Sunset Corner - Lin Shi</h3>
<p>Although the hot weather in the city is indeed suffocating, there is still a lovely dusk after all. And this dusk is even more delightful in the open spaces of bustling areas.</p>
<p>Looking from the east end, one can see a large clock towering on the roof of a tall building. The western sun has already set behind the treetops of a wealthy residence’s garden at the end of the road, only temporarily leaving its smiling glow reflected on the glass of the grand clock, shimmering with brilliant colors. The trees on both sides of the road, lush and green, also welcome the rosy sunset, and before long, they will exhale a refreshing scent in the evening breeze. The green grass in the open space also seems much more lively, as if they were too tired from being exposed to the scorching sun, and now let the gentle wind sway their waists, leisurely resting.</p>
<p>A young girl on the rooftop, draped in light gauze, opens the window and enjoys the cool breeze that chills her skin. Her soft hair is perfumed with the fragrance of perfume. Perhaps she has just woken up from an afternoon nap, or perhaps she has just finished a perfumed bath. Her slightly red face is reflected in the afterglow of the setting sun. She half-closes the curtains and quietly gazes at the open space from afar.</p>
<p>Besides the girl by the window, there are many other leisurely people in this open space. They wear short shirts of white fine cloth, white spun silk, or black Xiangyun silk. They roll up their sleeves, [unclear words] on the ground. They smoke their cigarettes, whistle their tunes, and tease their dapper songbirds. Like the few white-headed birds or mynas, the freedom-lost thrushes seem to have become accustomed to their confined lives and forgotten their flying instincts. They carelessly chirp, amusing their masters, pecking a worm or a grain of millet from their hands; they are satisfied.</p>
<p>Everyone can find an appropriate reason when they are about to do each thing they want to do. Therefore, the bird keepers, too lazy to even find a way to pass the time, have no choice but to stroll around the world with their birdcages; it is not as if there is no reason for their lives.</p>
<p>The foreign barracks lower their national flag amidst the soldiers’ salutes. The people in this open space give it a habitual glance, without any feelings in their hearts. But a foreign dog with its reins untied chases another small dog, running across the grass, which arouses great interest. And the young man sent out by the foreign owner to accompany the dog for a walk follows behind the dog, shouting and running, with a face full of sweat. Then, the leisurely people in the open space all break into laughter, and even the girl in front of the window laughs.</p>
<p>Dogs and people are chasing each other, birds are singing, people are laughing, and they are all enjoying themselves with the setting sun.</p>
<p>Along the side of the road, there are two or three worm sellers. Most of them have wandered from Shandong, far away, to this city, for their livelihood, for the hunger of their wives, children, and parents. But the shadow of unemployment and panic follows every unfortunate person from the countryside to the city; they are still unemployed, still hungry. However, they cannot feel despair about life because of this; at least, their wives and children force them not to think of despair, so they still have to use every possible way to live.</p>
<p>How many people are searching for scrap iron and broken cloth worth half a penny in the garbage cans at the street corners, how many people are picking up cigarette butts on the road, how many people... all these kinds of things become people's way of life; and this group that migrated from the north to the south has also found a way of life, which is to search for young worms in all kinds of weeds, willingly serving as offerings to the birds.</p>
<p>Because this is also a way to make a living, they go to the countryside far away from this city early every morning. From morning to afternoon, they constantly search for worm-infested reeds. Due to their own experience, they can tell from the withered leaves that the worm they need is lurking in the center of the reed stalk. They use a knife to cut off the stalk, peel off the leaves that wrap around the stalk, and then cut the worm-infested section neatly, and then tie them into bundles of fifty. That's how it is. They have to squeeze in and out of the reed bushes. Every long leaf of the reed is a long knife. These thousands of long knives make even the cattle and sheep that feed on grass dare not harm it, but these poor people, who are not as good as cattle and sheep, have to fight it desperately. As a result, their bare feet, arms, and even their faces and every other piece of flesh not covered by clothes are cut into thousands of line-like wounds by these thousands of long knives. From today to tomorrow, from early summer to late autumn, they continue without stopping. The old scars have not yet shed their scabs, and new scars are added. In this setting sun weather, these truly devoted to the birds expose their blood-soaked wounds, sit on the ground in the open space, and smile bitterly in the songs of the thrushes and white-headed birds in many bamboo cages.</p>
<p>"How many coppers for a bunch?" The bird owners inevitably bargain with them. The answer is a Shandong Yanzhou accent, mixed with Shanghai dialect:</p>
<p>"Boss! No haggling, honestly, ten hundred cash for a bunch."</p>
<p>"Nonsense, people are only selling eight coppers for a bunch, why do you want to sell ten?"</p>
<p>"What are theirs? What is this quality? What kind of worms are theirs? Empty, even if there are worms, they are dead. This one has worms in every one, and you don't pay if they are dead. Their bunch has less than forty stalks, this one has a full fifty stalks. Selling it to you, boss, for ten coppers a bunch, that's two cash for every five stalks, very cheap..."</p>
<p>The buyer also squats down to carefully examine the goods, holds one stalk and looks at both ends, saying:</p>
<p>"Look, empty, even if there are worms, they've run away."</p>
<p>"Run away! That's impossible." So he peels it open on the spot: "Look! Isn't this a worm? How big! How thick! You, boss, can't find it anywhere else." A smile of victory on his face.</p>
<p>"Nine coppers for a bunch, sell?"</p>
<p>"That won't do, I won't sell it for ninety-five cash."</p>
<p>The buyer runs away, holding the peeled-out worm, and immediately squats down in front of another seller. This makes him anxious, and he immediately lowers the price due to competition from his peers.</p>
<p>"Hey, one hundred and ninety cash for two bunches, want them?"</p>
<p>"No want, ninety cash a bunch, not one more cash."</p>
<p>"Alright, alright, take it away. No way, I have to sell cheap." A worried face, with veins popping out on his forehead. He also says: "Only buying one bunch? Boss, please help me out and buy another bunch!"</p>
<p>"What for so much?" He picks a bunch that he is very satisfied with, drops nine coppers, and goes to his birdcage. Even if it is ten coppers a bunch, being able to sell for a string of cash a day is considered the best. A family relies on this string of cash to live, and this is the only way to make a living.</p>
<p>After the birds have eaten their fill of young worms, they naturally chirp even more vigorously. But the time of dusk cannot be lingered on forever. Slowly, a dim twilight covers the open space. The leisurely people cover their birdcages with black cloth, letting them begin their night's rest. The dogs are still put back on their reins and led back to their foreign owners' homes, where beef tallow or ham awaits them. The worm sellers lazily pack up the unsold worms and go home with new wounds and hunger. Unfortunately, these many worms cannot be eaten as food. The girl on the rooftop also disappears at some point. From the window, the strong and gaudy song of the wireless radio drifts in with the evening breeze.</p>
<p>Everything will be quiet. Only a dozen military motorcycles in a row, fully loaded with armed "friendly" soldiers, swaggering back from probably practicing street fighting, are now driving back to camp. These things do not surprise the leisurely people in the concession because in recent years, they have long been accustomed to it.</p>

<h3>Goethe's Free Thought - Qi Fu</h3>
<p>"In the beginning was the deed (Im Anfang war die Tat)." This is the famous opening line of Faust, which is also an excellent annotation of materialism and pragmatism, showing the progressive thinking of this great poet. The first time I read Faust, I was attracted to this philosophical and insightful phrase. In Goethe's autobiography, we can also find some places that mutually illuminate this pragmatism. For example, when he talked about the self-aggrandizement of the two poets Klopstock and Gleim at the time, he said: "Judging from the spiritual influence they have given, they can undoubtedly be called great figures, but standing before the vast world, they are just weak. Days are long and nights are even longer, we cannot always write poetry or induce others to write poetry... Therefore, they overvalue themselves too much in their special and narrow relationship range, and regard their daily efforts and work as important, this importance is only recognized among themselves..." (Volume 10, Part 2) From this sentence, we can see how much Goethe valued practical life and external life, and sharply criticized the literati who only knew how to write poetry all day long and were detached from real social relations.</p>
<p>Judging from Goethe's era and social environment, Goethe's progressive thinking is not surprising. He was born in the famous free city of Frankfurt, Germany. His youth was the era when the free thoughts of Rousseau and Diderot in France were prevalent, and capitalism in Germany, especially Prussia, was also beginning to rise, and the feudal system was full of flaws. Indeed, his family background, who rose from merchants to nobles, made him somewhat attached to the glory of the past feudalism, but on the whole, he was a pioneer in the ideology of the new and revolutionary bourgeois class. Even Goethe's autobiography reveals a glimpse of this social consciousness. For example, Frankfurt had a revolt of the masses against the corrupt municipal government in the early 17th century. After the suppression, the leaders of these rebels were beheaded and displayed to the public, and their heads were still hanging on the Main River Bridge during Goethe's youth. As a result of Goethe's curious study of this story, he recognized the revolutionary nature of their rebellion and expressed great sympathy for them. He said: "I can't help but feel sorry for these unfortunate people, we should regard them as victims, only through them can the later improvement of the municipal government system be obtained" (later merchants and handicraftsmen had to participate in the municipal government) (see Volume 4, Part 1 of the Autobiography).</p>
<p>However, the most interesting part of Goethe's thought is that it forms a contrast with the Hitlerism that dominates Germany today (Koutra t we all know) that burning books was the first move of ideological rectification after Hitler came to power, but this is actually a trick from the Middle Ages, and this kind of thought control method cannot stop the surging of new ideas after all. Goethe also witnessed the comedy of burning books in his youth. In his autobiography (Volume 4, Part 1), there are these words: "We will always witness the execution of various death sentences, and what is more worth mentioning is that I was also present when a kind of book was burned. The burned book was a French humorous novel, but what it attacked was not the country, but religion and various etiquette rules. Seeing the punishment applied to an inanimate thing is indeed a terrible thing. A large bundle of books was bursting in the fire, and then they were fiddled with fire tongs so that they could have more contact with the flames. Before long, the burned books were flying in pieces in the air, and the masses were vying to grab them in their hands. Even we had to grab a book before we would give up, and many people would immediately try to find these banned books. Really, if the author wants to make people know, his own propaganda may not be better than this." In this way, Hitler and all ideological dictators' futility had already been ridiculed enough by Goethe.</p>
<p>Goethe's attitude towards Jews can even more show that he was not固於成見. In addition to spending a lot of ink on expressing his admiration for the Jewish ancestors Abraham, etc., he also had a good impression of contemporary Jews. He said: "They are also human beings, hardworking and kind, even if they stubbornly adhere to their customs, we should not despise them. When it comes to the anti-Jewish movement, he has even more of these words: "Modern people's views on Jews are a little better than before, but under the arched wall of the (Main River) Bridge Tower, there is a large picture mocking and humiliating them, which is full of extraordinary hostility to them, and it is still faintly visible now, which is inevitably unbearable for them. Because this painting is not from a private rogue, but from a public institution" (see the same volume). This reproach can now be applied to the Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>This great poet - a poet who is still regarded as a national treasure by the Nazis today - has been dead for one hundred and four years. The dictator of his motherland is still taking the medieval tricks that he criticized and ridiculed as得意之作. Is Goethe too progressive, or is Hitler driving backwards? If Goethe knew, he would be indignant for it!</p>
<h3>Sad Sounds on the River - Fei Er</h3>
<p>Night in the city means splendid lights and soul-stirring music. On the river, there are also bright lights and singing voices accompanied by music. On land, there is the overflowing aroma of wine, smoke rings like thick fog exhaled, the loud sound of mahjong coming from the tables, and above all, cheap women under the recession. On the water, nothing has changed, except that a "club" has moved onto the water.</p>
<p>Swing! Rock! The wind blows, and the subtropical climate changes. Sing! Play! Who knows what tomorrow holds?</p>
<p>Pitiful are the "human flesh" who sell their bodies!</p>
<p>"Tomorrow, my voice will be hoarse, my flesh will rot, and my bones will be exposed in the wilderness(!)" (Boat Girl's Song)</p>
<p>The women on the river would not sing such tunes themselves, but who knows: might their souls be singing such songs?</p>
<p>And so the river tide sobs, and the wind blows across the laments of the world.</p>
<p>Yet: "Sing! Sing!" The singing voice mingles with the smell of meat. Who should know what tomorrow holds?</p>
<h3>Lazy Praise - Written by Czech Karel Capek</h3>
<p>Today I need to be lazy; perhaps because laziness is so particularly lovely, or because the carpenter is working in the courtyard below, or because the sun is shining, or because of countless other reasons. I need to be lazy.</p>
<p>I don't need to go for a walk, because walking is not laziness; nor do I need to read or sleep, because neither of these is laziness; nor do I need to entertain myself, and even less do I need to rest, because laziness is neither entertainment nor rest. Laziness, pure, complete laziness, is neither leisure nor worry; it is something with some negativity; it is a state of being isolated from those focused, entertaining, worrying, interested, melancholy, joyful, impressive, eagerly desiring, uncomfortable, bewitching, attracting, or annoying events. It is a kind of emptiness, a kind of negation, a kind of purposeless state. It is a pure and rare thing.</p>
<p>First, laziness is not killing time. For example, if I wanted to kill time, I would take a sieve to draw water. But when I am being lazy, that is exactly what I don't do; I don't do unnecessary things, because I don't do anything at all.</p>
<p>Second, laziness is not the mother of evil; being completely indifferent, it will not be the mother of anything. Its emotional effects will not affect others, because if those emotional effects achieve this purpose, it is not laziness; it will do something, it will have a purpose.</p>
<p>Third, laziness is not indolence. To be indolent is to avoid doing something one should do while hoping to do it with less effort. And to be lazy is to not do anything at all, not to do anything, and even less to hope for something to do.</p>
<p>To be lazy is also not to rest. If you are resting, you are doing something beneficial; you are preparing for other work. Laziness has no connection with any past or future work; it has no result, and no foresight.</p>
<p>Laziness is also not the enjoyment of rest. To bask in the sun, to flash your happy eyes, or to meow like a cat—all of these are actions to achieve a certain purpose, because at least they have some enjoyment, and enjoyment itself is somewhat like a purpose. Laziness is absolutely purposeless; it seeks neither rest nor happiness, but is absolute emptiness.</p>
<p>Rest is a slow-flowing stream, this stream silently turning bubbles and rippling; rest is a dark and still pond, on this water, floating those bad or powerfully energetic garbage and foam; indolence is a small river, covered with green water plants, mud, and tadpoles; but laziness is static - it has no melody, no sound, and it does not move forward. It does not endow water plants, mud, or mosquitoes with life. Its water is dead and transparent. No matter how long it lasts, it does not become warm. It is unchanging. It has no direction, no content, and no color or taste.</p>
<p>Today I need to be lazy; no, I need to not think about anything.</p>
<p>I need! What do I need, in reality? Nothing; because that in reality is laziness. To be like a stone, but without weight. To be like a pool of water, but without reflection. To be like a cloud, but without movement. To be like a beast, but without hunger. To be like a person, but without thought. To stare at a blank piece of paper that is empty and smooth. Not to write anything but to keep staring, until (out of its own accord) it is filled with black calligraphy, words, sentences, rows, from top to bottom; one side, the second side, and the third side. Then, there is no need to read it; with the existence of a strong, true, deep laziness, there is no need to read it again, but to turn my eyes to the first spring escape that climbs over the window and not to look at it. Then - but what fixed procedure does laziness have? Everywhere, you can find something not to do, not to see, not to stare at.</p>
<p>When you have said goodbye to laziness, and you wake up, you seem to have returned from another world. Everything is a little awkward, a little separated, a little inappropriate, and a little forced; you feel like… so strange… as a result… ah, you have to rest after your laziness. While resting, you have to yawn, and be even lazier just a little bit, and then lie down and rest just a little while; only after these things, you can restore all your functions, to do some completely unnecessary things. (Translated by Luo Wei)</p>
<h3>On the Way to the East - Qi Fu</h3>
<p>Although I never intended to be a collaborator or harbored the ambition of becoming a "Japan expert," it was a rare opportunity for me to be able to run to Japan for "sightseeing" at a time when Sino-Japanese relations were being "adjusted" and the "February 26th Incident" was still fresh and hot. I heard that after the "February 26th Incident," the Japanese authorities were particularly wary of foreigners. In order to avoid trouble when landing and to thoroughly experience the flavor of the East, I specially chose to take the ×× Maru, which goes from Hong Kong directly to the west coast of South America. Apart from a few dozen old passengers in third class heading to Peru, there were not many passengers. The first and second classes were more like a formality. When it was almost time to set sail, more than twenty third-class passengers who wanted to land in Yokohama first and then try to go to Peru were caught by the "ship's officer" and sent ashore. Their anxious and worried expressions while hurriedly moving their luggage revealed the origin of the overseas Chinese to us. Even among the Peruvian passengers who were all on the ship, there were many middle-aged people. From their early gray hair, somewhat dull eyes and expressions, and dim conversations, we deeply felt that this "route" had no future. Compared with the development of Japanese immigration and trade in South America - especially in Peru and Brazil - there is no need to say more.</p>
<p>After four days of calm and monotonous life, we arrived at Moji—Japan's major coal port and military stronghold, opposite the fortress of Shimonoseki (i.e., the Shimonoseki of the Treaty of Shimonoseki). When we were about to arrive, the passengers had received a written warning prohibiting photography and surveying. At a time when the international espionage war was in full swing, this was naturally a move that the Japanese, who were particularly sensitive to the feeling of war, should have taken. As soon as the ship docked, six or seven Moji water police officers boarded the ship to interrogate the passengers. They were all full of spirit: repeatedly saying "Mr.," a cunning old man who knew Chinese, a haughty young interpreter who could speak English, all interrogating us as if it were a big deal. A small merchant from Guangdong who did not have a penny on him and I, who had neither applied for a passport (a passport was not originally required to go to Japan) nor brought any certificate, became the objects of their special interrogation. In addition to reporting a very detailed resume and showing all the money, we also had to open our luggage for them to inspect one by one. Fortunately, I did not bring any books, which saved them a little inspection effort. However, as a result, the small merchant and I were both given the punishment of "prohibition of landing" in Moji. I still don't know why. My change was also sealed up and handed over to the ship's purser for temporary safekeeping. "Mr. ×, I advise you to go back from Yokohama, otherwise there will be a lot of trouble ashore!" This was the English interpreter's advice and intimidation to me before he left.</p>
<p>Although the first customs of Japan gave me an unpleasant impression that lacked "friendship," after passing Moji, the scenery of the Seto Inland Sea of Japan—the so-called "Japanese Mediterranean"—somewhat washed away my sadness and anger: the soft green seawater, the constantly appearing white sails, the verdant and sometimes ornamented with pavilions, the islands belonging to each other with jagged pines reflecting the water, shrouded in a thin mist like light silk, the sunlight piercing the mist, truly giving people a feeling of etherealness like a divine mountain at sea.</p>
<p>When the ship docked in Kobe, the faces of the water police were not so ferocious, and they "graciously allowed" me to go ashore for sightseeing. When disembarking, it was just past dusk. After strolling through one or two rather quiet streets from the pier, I arrived at the city center with brilliant lights, and the Motomachi, the so-called "night market street," could be seen at a glance. Motomachi is a small road with small shops densely arranged and no vehicles allowed. Decoration shops, foreign goods shops, and pastry shops with colorful and dazzling arrays are like the scenery of Guanqian Street in Suzhou. And the dissolute music of the bars flowing out of the small alleys, the gorgeously dressed "hostesses" (female waiters) looking out at the alley entrances, and the pedestrians, sometimes mixed with foreigners and sailors, gave it a strong atmosphere of a commercial port, which made people think of Yantai in summer. There are many young women among the pedestrians. Although they are wearing "kimonos" with different paintings, they are all painted with the same thick, buried real face powder. Entering Motomachi, the most eye-catching and admirable thing is the lamppost densely lined up on both sides. At the top of each pole, there are four bright electric lights with white lampshades, and they are bent towards the center of the street. Therefore, the electric lights facing each other on both sides create almost an arch. The tired sailors who casually stroll under it are not only melted in a gentle glow, but also welcomed by this orderly beauty that seems to have no end in sight, and cannot help but slow down. Like other overseas cities where overseas Chinese gather, Kobe has a so-called "Chinatown," just behind Motomachi. There are several Chinese restaurants there - especially Cantonese restaurants - as well as meat shops and pharmacies run by Chinese. Although it is not particularly dirty, the wet and uneven streets and the dim lights make it seem like an underground world compared to the Motomachi next door.</p>
<p>The next day, before the ship left, I strolled to the famous "Minatogawa Shrine," which is a temple dedicated to Masashige Kusunoki, a famous loyal minister of Japan in the 14th century (somewhat like Guan Yu and Yue Fei in China). There are several halls, almost all made of wood. Like all old-fashioned buildings in Japan, although they are not grand enough, they are full of simple beauty: the high-flapping eaves like crow wings, a piece of soft ocher wood color, and the slightly decorated box-shaped wooden lanterns hanging at the entrance, also show a solemn and deep atmosphere. The surrounding green old trees add a bit of antique flavor to the entire temple garden. Although statues of gods and incense candles are not visible, there is a wooden trough-like thing placed on the worship platform in front of the hall for people to donate money. Two days later will be the festival of Kusunoki Masashige, so there are many tourists, and the pious men and women standing on the worship platform with their heads bowed and hands clasped are also constantly following. That kind of pious and admiring attitude is no less than that of the old gentlemen who kneel three times and kowtow nine times.</p>
<p>After the ship sailed from Kobe again, it was still interrogated one by one by the water police in Yokkaichi (a small city) and Yokohama, the port of arrival. Although in the end, no one was given the punishment of "prohibition of landing," it is really unheard of to conduct a detailed inspection every time a port is reached even after entering the country (however, this kind of situation exists when traveling along the Shanxi-Taiyuan Road in China). Japan insisted on not being afraid of the trouble, probably to show off the power of its police network to the new passengers. When it was almost time to arrive in Yokohama, in addition to filling out a form about the contents of the luggage carried, it was also necessary to fill out a special sheet, reporting the types, number of volumes, author's name, and even a summary of the contents of the books carried. The Japanese authorities' prevention of "ideological criminals" also revealed a clue from this initiative.</p>

<h3>Next World Games Location: Announcement Possible Today or Tomorrow; Britain Withdraws from Competition; Philippines and Liechtenstein Join</h3>
<p>National Maritime Press, Berlin, July 29th: At the International Olympic Committee's meeting held before the World Games, today's session took place at the University of Berlin, chaired by Count Latour. Hayes, representing German leader Hitler, welcomed foreign guests and athletes, and the Mayor of Berlin welcomed representatives and dignitaries from various countries.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Berlin, July 29th: Regarding the location for the 1940 Olympic Games, the competition currently involves Britain, Japan, and Finland. The International Olympic Committee will decide the victor. The committee held a formal meeting this afternoon with great solemnity. The chairman was Baron de Baillet Latour from Belgium. Attendees from Germany included Hitler's representative, Minister Hess, Interior Minister Dr. Frick, Olympic Committee Chairman Lewald, sports leader Tschammer und Osten, and Berlin City Council Senior Member Rieber. Also present were ambassadors and ministers from countries participating in the Games, presidents of national sports associations, and team leaders from various countries, creating a lively atmosphere. The meeting hall was adorned with the Olympic flag and the swastika flag. First, Hitler's representative, Hess, delivered the opening remarks, stating that guests from various countries had traveled far to participate in this peaceful international competition. He extended a sincere welcome on behalf of the German leader and people, expressing the hope that participating nations would take pride in the courage and spirit of their own athletes while also recognizing and appreciating the spirit of athletes from other countries, without jealousy. He also emphasized the importance of respecting the unique national characteristics of each country, aligning with the spirit of Baron Pierre de Coubertin (French), the founder of the modern Olympic Games, for whom he could be proud of his achievements. Next, Berlin City Council Senior Member Rieber rose to deliver a welcoming address on behalf of the city of Berlin. Following the address, Chairman Baillet Latour spoke, vigorously defending the Olympic Games' rules regarding amateur status for athletes to prevent commercialization. He then elaborated on the power of the Olympic spirit, stating that with the issue of the next Games' location on the committee's agenda, the athletes from the three competing countries – Britain, Japan, and Finland – gathered together, sharing each other's company day and night, demonstrating the power of the Olympic spirit. He emphasized the profound benefits of the Olympic Games for young people, explaining why so many nations vie to host the next Games. He acknowledged that each of the three candidates possesses unique strengths, making the selection extremely difficult. Finally, the chairman praised Pierre de Coubertin for his contributions to peace through the establishment of the Games, suggesting he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize. German Olympic Committee Chairman Lewald then compared the three cities vying for the next Games' location: Tokyo, London, and Helsinki (the capital of Finland). He noted that two were capitals of major powers, while Helsinki was the capital of a smaller nation. However, he emphasized that the general public in Helsinki had a great enthusiasm for sports, and the city had produced many outstanding athletes. He concluded that the chosen city would be announced at the end of the Games on August 16th, and the flag of the winning nation would be raised atop the flagpole at the current Games venue. The International Committee then adjourned and was scheduled to reconvene tomorrow.</p>
<p>Allied News, Tokyo, July 30th: Following London's withdrawal as a candidate city for the Olympics, Mr. Iwahara, Director of the Physical Education Division of the Ministry of Education, happily told reporters that while London's votes would not necessarily all go to Tokyo, it was undoubtedly beneficial to Japan. He expressed his belief that Tokyo would be able to secure the bid for the next Games and expressed gratitude for Britain's goodwill.</p>
<p>Allied News, Berlin, July 30th: With Britain's withdrawal as a candidate and Canada's clear expression of support for Japan, the situation is increasingly favorable for Japan. However, due to the progress of the discussions, a decision on the host city is unlikely before the 30th and will likely be delayed until the 31st.</p>
<p>(Havas News Agency, Berlin, July 30th): Regarding the location for the next Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee reconvened this morning. The British representative formally announced the withdrawal of London's bid but argued that the 1940 Games should be held in London. The Japanese representative then spoke, requesting that Tokyo be chosen to host the 1940 Games. It is currently unknown whether a decision will be reached today.</p>
<p>(Havas News Agency, Berlin, July 30th): At its meeting this morning, the International Olympic Committee decided to accept the Philippines and Liechtenstein as members of the Olympic Games. Furthermore, American committee member Mr. Zemke was barred from attending the meeting due to his writings criticizing German leader Hitler. He was replaced by the chairman of the American Olympic Committee, Mr. Brundage.</p>

<h3>Minor Incident During World Games Torch Arrival in Vienna; Nazi Party Members Seize Opportunity for Demonstration; Government Authorities Determined to Strictly Suppress It; Torch Arrived in Czechoslovakia Yesterday</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Vienna, July 29th: The Olympic torch, which departed from Athens on July 20th, having passed through Bulgaria and Hungary, arrived here tonight. Sports leader Prince Starhemberg (former Deputy Prime Minister) and other dignitaries attended the celebration. However, Nazi Party members seized the opportunity to stage a demonstration, leading to incidents. Upon seeing Prince Starhemberg and representatives from Jewish organizations, they shouted "Heil Hitler" in contempt. Police rushed to suppress the demonstration, but they were scattered by the large number of party members. Reinforcements were called in, and the demonstrators were dispersed, with over a hundred arrested. Order was gradually restored, but the situation remained tense into the evening, so police maintained a partial state of alert to prevent any further incidents. Following the disturbance, the cabinet immediately convened an emergency meeting, and the chief of the Vienna police, Mr. Skubl, and several senior officers were summoned to attend. The cabinet then telephoned State Chancellor Schuschnigg (who is currently vacationing in Salzburg) to report on the incident. According to informed sources, the government has decided to adopt strict measures to suppress the activities of the Nazi Party, even if these measures might affect the recently established German-Austrian agreement.</p>
<p>(National Maritime Press, Vienna, July 30th): The World Games torch crossed the border between Austria and Czechoslovakia at 9:45 this morning and is now heading towards the Czech capital. There will be another grand celebration upon the torch's arrival in the Czech capital.</p>
<p>(National Maritime Press, Vienna, July 30th): World skiing champion Karl Schäfer suffered a slight injury while carrying the World Games torch to Vienna. While lighting the torch, he was caught in a gust of wind, burning his face.</p>
<p>(Havas News Agency, Vienna, July 20th): When the Olympic torch arrived here last night, many Nazi Party members infiltrated the celebration and staged a demonstration, attempting to cause trouble. Military police arrested over 300 people, half of whom have since been released. According to investigations, many of those arrested were German Nazi Party members who had planned the demonstration beforehand. They had received a large sum of money from an unknown source to purchase tickets to the event. Authorities are currently investigating who orchestrated the demonstration.</p>
<h3>New Timing Devices Used at This World Games</h3>
<p>(Right) The starting pistol and timing devices used at this World Games, invented by Mr. Filitz, can record to one-hundredth of a second. Simultaneously, its movement during the firing of the starting pistol uses electric current to be captured on camera, opening a new record for time recording in track and field events.</p>
<p>(Right) The automatic printing machine invented by Mr. Filitz can record time clearly and in detail on a long strip of white paper. This invention will also be used at this World Games. From now on, the time records, which are most prone to problems, can be resolved by this invention.</p>
<h3>Rotary Cup Tournament Opens Tomorrow; Chinese Team Selected with He Jialiu and Six Others; Zhang Dingzhao Originally Selected but Declared Withdrawal Due to Foot Pain</h3>
<p>The 7th International Rotary Cup Tennis Championship is scheduled to begin tomorrow, August 1st, at the Canidrome Tennis Club. Participants include teams from China, Britain, the United States, France, Japan, Germany, and Portugal. The selection of representatives for the Chinese team, which has been underway for several days by Mr. Hu Xiansheng, Chairman of the Tennis Committee of the Sports Association, during the Canidrome Open, was finalized yesterday. The list is as follows: (1) He Jialiu, (2) Luo Min, (3) Zhou Guanjun, (4) Li Guofan, (5) Liu Jie, (6) Tang Doujia, and (7) Hu Xuguang. Mr. Zhang Dingzhao, who was to represent Shanghai in the National Games, was originally selected but, unfortunately, declared his withdrawal due to severe foot pain and is currently receiving medical treatment. Three matches are scheduled for tomorrow's opening day: China vs. Germany, the United States vs. Portugal, and Japan vs. France. The lineup for the Chinese team was determined yesterday by Chairman Hu. However, since first singles player He Jialiu will also be playing an exhibition match against a Japanese player at the French Chamber of Commerce on the same day, he will not be able to participate in the first week's match against Germany. Fortunately, the German team's strength is mediocre, so this should not affect the Chinese team's progress. The lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>(August 1st) First Singles: Luo Min, Second Singles: Zhou Guanjun, Third Singles: Tang Baojia.</p>
<p>(August 2nd) First Doubles: Zhou Guanjun and Liu Jie, Second Doubles: Li Guofan and Hu Xuguang.</p>
<h3>Molière Cup Doubles Semifinals; Li Ming Eliminated Yesterday; Carson and Squires Win Right to Final with 3-1 Victory; He/Liu vs. Kerr/Cox Incomplete, Decision Continues Today</h3>
<p>The Canidrome Open Tennis Molière Cup Doubles Tournament, after several days of elimination rounds, began the semifinals yesterday. As a result, Carson and Squires defeated Li Guofan and Hu Xuguang 3-1, winning the right to the final. The match between He Jialiu/Liu Jie and Kerr/Cox saw each team winning two sets. As dusk fell, both sides agreed to continue the match at 5 PM today. After the match, the winners will immediately face Carson and Squires in the championship match. In the Canidrome Open singles competition, only Luo Min from China has advanced to the semifinal week. All finalists are foreigners. In the doubles competition, only He/Liu and Li/Hu advanced to the semifinal week. Unfortunately, Li/Hu were eliminated yesterday, leaving He/Liu as the only hope. It is hoped that they will achieve good results today. However, they must also play the final immediately, making the prospects for winning the championship extremely bleak. The results of yesterday's semifinals are recorded below:</p>
<p>Carson/Squires win the right to the final</p>
<p>Carson and Squires' victory over Li Guofan and Hu Xuguang was expected. In yesterday's match, Li and Hu won the opening game with a service ace. Carson and Squires then won four consecutive games. Li and Hu then won back two games, losing the first set 3-6. The second set was even worse, with only one game won at 5-0 down, before losing it 1-6. In the third set, Li and Hu's momentum was strong, winning three consecutive games. Although Carson and Squires quickly won two games at 3-0 down, Li and Hu soon won three more games, pulling back a set 6-2. In the fourth set, Carson exerted himself, volleying at the net. Hu Xuguang then won a game with a service ace, down 4-0. In the following two games, Li and Hu showed no fighting spirit, losing the fourth set 1-6. The overall result was 3-1, with Carson and Squires winning the right to the final. Hu Xuguang was able to exert his true strength in yesterday's match. The scores are as follows:</p>
<p>Another Match: Continues Today</p>
<p>In the other match, He Jialiu and Liu Jie faced Kerr and Cox. The skills of the two sides were evenly matched. In the first set of yesterday's match, He and Liu appeared rusty, losing four consecutive games at the beginning. The score became 5-1. He Jialiu then regained a game with a powerful smash, but they soon lost the first set 2-6. At the start of the second set, He and Liu took the lead with one game. The score became 3-3. He and Liu then won three consecutive games with excellent passing shots, pulling back a set 6-3. In the third set, Kerr and Cox won the first game. He and Liu took the lead with 2-1, and the future looked bright. However, due to a momentary lapse, they lost three consecutive games. They then chased to 3-4. At 4-5, there was a good chance of equality. Under extremely tense conditions, Kerr and Cox won 6-4. The fourth set was critical to the outcome. He and Liu were very careful, taking the lead 1-0. Kerr and Cox then came back with 2-1. Liu Jie then saved many dangerous balls. He Jialiu also volleyed at the net, winning three consecutive games. In the seventh game, after two deuces, Cox won with two powerful overheads. Finally, He and Liu's efforts pulled it back to 6-3. At this point, each team had won two sets. Dusk had fallen and visibility was poor. Both sides agreed to postpone the deciding set until tomorrow.</p>
<p>(To be continued at 5 PM this afternoon)</p>
<p>Today's Schedule:</p>
<p>Carson/Squires vs. Winners of the above two teams (Final), Wang Miaosong vs. Wang Miaoxing (Exhibition Match), 2 PM.</p>
<h3>City Government Staff Tennis Tournament</h3>
<p>The City Government Staff Tennis Tournament, organized by the City Sports Field, concluded the doubles competition the day before yesterday. Yesterday, there were originally two singles matches. However, Wu Yuhua forfeited to Wang Huabin, so only the match between Huang Hua and Ma Youcheng took place. Currently, Wang Huabin has eleven points, and Huang Hua has nine points. Neither has lost a set, so the championship is likely to be contested between the two. Today's competition is suspended. Yesterday's results are as follows:</p>
