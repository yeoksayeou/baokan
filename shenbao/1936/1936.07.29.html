<p>時評</p>
<h3>西班牙亂事的國際意義</h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>西班牙右派各法西斯勢力。自從保皇黨領袖索台洛於十二日被人謀殺以後。卽在北非西屬摩洛哥地方首先揚起反叛的旗幟。後來又在全國各地發動。圖謀推倒左傾的人民政府。一時聲勢頗大。京城瑪德里且曾一度遭受威脅。現在各地的武裝衝突。雖然仍在繼續發展。不過因為人民政府所行政策之深得民心。大部民衆都已全體出動。帮助政府去討伐叛衆。因此政府軍的地位現已佔相當的優勢。右派法西斯的暴力政變之將失敗。想來祗不過是時間上遲早的問題。</p>
<p>我們且放開這次西班牙亂事的最後結果不說。而來一論此次事伴在國際方面的意義與影響。西班牙事件之所以在國際方面發生重大的影響。的有二種原因。第一。西班牙亂事的結果。於全世界之民主與法西斯二大勢力的消長。有重大的關係。第二。由於西班牙在西地中海所佔的重要地位。其內政的演變。於帝國主義者在地中海上的勢力。有很大的影響。西班牙自後二月中旬大選後。政樅已全操在左派的手中。西班牙人民陣綫的勝利。不但給國內的右翼法西斯勢力以重大的打擊。並且對於全世界法西斯勢力的抬頭。也給予很大的打擊。而於各國左傾勢力的活動。則於無形中給以極大的鼓勵。所以在這次的亂事中。全世界的左傾勢力無一不對西班牙人民政府的堅决奮鬥。寄予極大的同情。並各請求其政府援助瑪德里當局。俾得早日戡定叛衆。法國左翼各黨之要求政府輸出軍火。英國工黨之請求政府干涉西國亂事以及比國社會黨之電賀西國人民政府的奮鬬精神。都是明顯的例子。至全世界的法西斯勢力。則都對於西班牙的叛衆。予以精神上與物質上的援助。據英國曼撤斯脫導報的記載。「西班牙亂黨。尤其是摩洛哥屬地亂黨所用軍械。多來自意國。」法國人民報也說西班牙叛軍總司令弗朗哥將軍曾向意國購得飛機二十四架。這消息雖經意國政府否認。但空穴來風。總不能使人完全釋然。意國之所以出此。是因為西班牙的右派法西斯制度成立後。它就可以從中漁利。得在地中海上樹立覇權。德國政府對於西班牙亂事。也極為注意。因為這與國社黨勢力在西歐的發展有重大的關係。據曼撤斯脫導報所載。德國原在西班牙設有國社黨分部多處。最近又有多數德人前往西國。假借考察外交與敎育之名。而行政治與軍事間牒之實。德國在地中海上西屬巴列牙爾羣島與摩洛哥地方。且已有很大的勢力。要是叛黨此次事變能够成功。那末他就可在這些地方得到立足地。而其在西歐的勢力也將因此大增了。</p>
<p>至於英國保守黨政府。對於西班牙的叛衆。一方面是很同情的。因為如果人民政府獲得勝利後。則在其影響下的葡萄牙民衆就不免要受衝動。起而推倒現政府。但在另一方面。英國却又不願見人民政府完全失敗。因為法西斯勢力勝利後。意國在地中海上的力量必形增加。這於英國的直布羅陀海軍根據地與其在地中海上的覇權。實為最重大的威脅。至於法國人民政府。當然是很同情西班牙人民政府的。不過因為國內右派的反對。它還不敢去干涉西國的內政。以免引起更嚴重的國際糾紛。法內閣之下令禁止軍火輸入西國。就是個顯例。</p>
<p>總之。不論西班牙亂事的前途如何。其最後結局之於國際上所起的影響。必然是非常重大的。我們如果站在反帝與擁護民主勢力之民衆的立塲上。那末對於西班牙人民政府的艱因奮鬥。是應寄與極大的同情的。</p>

<h3>日本旅行記　（九）</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　胡仲持　胡一臧</p>
<p>（八）大阪城</p>
<p>午後在旅館里承任領事過訪。他邀了我們去遊大阪城。</p>
<p>大阪城是日本歷史上無比的民族英雄豐臣秀吉所造的。他侵略過朝鮮戰勝過明軍。日本民族向大陸發展的雄心也許可以說是出於他的戰功的啟示的吧。自從一五八五年，他徵發了成萬的民伕築起這個空前堅固的石城來以後，他的聲威不但懾服了全體的島民，甚至還使當時中國的朝廷也有些震驚。明朝的神宗皇帝怕他再來侵犯國境，想用懷柔政策來對付他，於是派遺了正使楊方亨副使沈惟毅渡海到日本去。這兩個使臣便在大阪城里向豐臣獻了金印，遞了國書。國書上最重要的一句話就是：「特封爾為國王」。殊不知豐臣根本瞧不起我們這一個泱决大國，他聽到受封的話竟大怒起來，對着中國使臣，把明朝皇帝辱駡了一番。等到方沈兩使狼狽回來，明朝皇帝明知道丟了面子，也無可如何。這一個歷史故事是日本人最所誇耀的，連小學敎科書上也特別强調地記述着。然而在我們中國人看來，這可不是中國對日外交失敗史的第一章麼？</p>
<p>除了這麼一種歷史的意義以外，大阪城還有一種更重要的，地理的—也仍然可以說歷史的—意義。我們須知今日那麼繁盛的大阪在十六世紀原是一片荒烟蔓草。豐臣秀吉造好了這座城，大阪方才奠定了都市的基礎。此後這都市逐漸地發展起來，終於變成了日本資本主義的重心。</p>
<p>今日的大阪到處都有富麗堂皇的建築物表現着機械文明的威勢了，但是三百五十年前完全用人力築造的大阪城却還不能不使我們驚歎一番。這座城完全用大石頭堆成。城門旁邊嵌着的幾塊尤其大得驚人。當時豐臣秀吉手下的人們怎樣把那麼多的笨重的大石頭，純粹用着體力，從山上遠遠的搬過來，堆積得那麼整齊，那麼彌縫，委實是機械時代的我們所想不懂的。</p>
<p>（註）大阪城著名的巨石有四塊，（一）蛸石，高八公尺，闊十一公尺餘，在內城門東首。（二）振袖石，高四公尺半，闊十三公尺餘，在內城門西首，（三）龍石，在外城門東首，（四）虎石，在外城門西首，龍虎兩石各高四公尺半，闊六公尺半。</p>
<p>大阪城的大部分連同城外的廣塲已經劃作公園了。五年以前，大阪市民捐集了一百五十萬圓的經費，把這個公園創立起來，作為昭和登極的紀念事業。因此，不但城內外到處有着賞心悅目的綠蔭和草地，而且城內還巍然聳峙着一個新建的桃山時代式樣的天守閣，使遊城的人們更加增添了興味。</p>
<p>這個供市民遊覽的古城，在歷史上做過幾决的戰塲，在今日似乎也還是殺氣瀰漫的軍事地點。我們一進城，就看見左右兩所西式的房屋，招牌上寫着陸軍兵器支廠和兵器庫。再進去又看見第四師團司令部。這所黃褐色的高大的四層洋樓，彷彿脾睨着斜對面的那一所純日本風的尊貴的紀州御殿。殿前開日本式的庭園，略有假山和林泉的點綴。我們沿着園路直進，再上石階數十步，便到天守閣了。</p>
<p>天守閣是一座巍峨的高樓，白的牆，黑的瓦，簷只五重樓有八層，樓頂金光燦爛的閃耀着一對魚頭似的裝飾物，名呌金　。這一種數百年前的建築式樣聽說是借一幅古屏風上關於大阪城戰事的繪景做藍本的。可是也只有外表如此。一進裏面，就覺得道是全用鋼骨混凝土建造的非常堅固的現代建築物了。我們在樓下買了觀覽券，乘了電梯上去。到頂樓憑着闌干向四邊的風景眺望了一會。於是走下來參觀各層的陳列品。那些陳列品都是大阪歷史上的遺物，有先史時代的鬼板和古陶器，有建都時代的種種器物，有鄉土先賢的許多遺像，有歷代名人各種書畫，又有最初從荷蘭輸入的天文鏡之類。豐臣秀吉所遺留的東西在那里保存得很多，最引起注意的是他的旗標古兜古劍以及他的筆法優秀的墨蹟。這些三四百年前的古物該使一般的觀覽者追懷到那位征略過大陸的英雄的勳業吧。然而我們却沒有這樣的懷想。我們看了建都時代的衣冠文物，只感覺到日本從中國文化上所承受的恩惠多麼浩大罷了。</p>

<p>（倫敦）自英王愛德華八世取消在法國里維拉地方休假之計劃後、英首相鮑爾溫、昨亦宣布放棄星期四赴愛克斯勒彭消磨假日之計劃、仍將留在國內辦公、英王與首相同時變更之巧合、加以英外相艾登昨在下院辯論外部經費預算時、曾鄭重聲言國際現狀之複雜、致國會方面對於時局頗多揣測，此間一般人皆以為鮑氏改變計畫、係與艾登措辭嚴重之演說有關、尤以其尙未將政府之成見發揮無餘一語更為人所注意、又以為在此後數月之內、任何方面决無冒險之事發生云、關於英王之决定不往里維拉、官方並無解釋、（二十八日路透電）</p>

<h3>英國下議院　討論外交政策　外交部預算案通過</h3>
<p>（倫敦）下院昨日辯論外交部預算、外相艾登說明國際現局之錯綜情形、謂自德國重佔萊茵後、英政府卽力圖開始安定歐洲大局之談判、英政府具此精神、曾於三月間向德政府提出條問、此項條問、旣非苛刻、亦非穿鑿、惟表示一種便利進步之誠摯企圖耳、英政府如能早接具體覆文、則可省却許多光陰、近在倫敦舉行之羅卡諾三國會議、亦以同樣精神出之、渠今敢謂、倫敦會議所獲結果、可以表明三國所抱完全建設性之目的、至所以能獲此結果者、多賴法比兩國當局有遠大之政治才具、並能豪爽合作有以致之、會議終結時所發表之公報、證明吾人現以前途是重、而非專顧已往、英政府願贊同成立羅卡諾新諒解、以促進歐洲一般之解决、法比兩國均深有同感、渠望致德意兩國之請書、必可獲滿意之答覆、五國會議召集之前、有甚多預備工作、須由外交途徑吿成之、庶會議能獲有益之結果、目前雖仍有許多障礙、尙待銷除、但已達於有關係諸國間具有眞正合作精神之地步矣、</p>
<p>外相决述蒙特婁會議所成立之海峽新公的、謂該會議最重要之敎訓、厥為遵照尋常手續與國際關係原則、以談判與同意而修正條約、能成立一種解决、較諸以片面行動否認條約義務之手段、更受有關係各方面之贊同、該會議確已使英政府與土耳其政府獲有更密切更和諧之諒解外相决述及國聯改革事、切實聲明政府之目的、乃在擴大與鞏固國際合作之基礎、但詳細辦法、今猶未便發表、蓋恐妨害九月間舉行之國聯會議也、</p>
<p>至是乃涉及代管地移轉問題、謂此舉牽涉受託之列强、英政府尙未與他國磋商此事、惟就英政府觀之、該問題必將引起道德上政治上與法律上之重大困難、而須設法以覓得一種解决、外相末謂、目前有許多國際問題尙未解决、政府希望任何方面、勿使各國再發生嚴重爭點云、自由黨提出减少外部預算之修正文、由下院以二九〇對一四三票否决、外部預算旋付表决、以三一三對一三八票通過、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>外相决述及片面宣言、以擴張對意實施經濟制裁時期中、所予地中海某某數國之保證、及制裁終止後之不穩時期、謂渠所引以為樂者、今有特殊理由可聲明、此種不安穩地位已吿終止、本月中旬左右、意政府已自動向南斯拉夫。希臘。土耳其三國政府發表宣言、其內容曾由意國駐英代辦通告英政府、此公文明白表示意政府已向此三國政府作極顯明之保蹬、卽意政府從未計繼、且現亦未計議、對三國取任何侵略行動以報復其實施對意制裁、意國駐該三國代表、並切實聲明、意政府視制裁之一事確已完全結束、深信今後各國將入於相互合作之新時代、故渠本人殊樂於承認並宣布者、英政府以為今已無需賡續片面之保證矣、</p>
<p>外相决對英埃談判新的所獲之進步、表示滿意、繼乃略述西班牙大局、謂該國自突然發生大規模內亂後、今仍在劇烈戰鬥中、前途如何、未可逆料、外相於是乃詳述保護該國危險區域內英僑計畫、謂已電達西班牙外長、西班牙政府亦已覆電接受、此渠所引以為慰者、</p>
<p>述及但澤市問題、外相對於國聯會駐該市高級委員萊斯特備致揄揚、旋卽轉其詞鋒、陳述殖民地問題、謂「與此項問題有關者、不僅英國而已、凡他國受國聯會委託、而有委任統治地者、亦均有關係、就我國政府而論、委任統治地轉讓問題、定將在道德上政治上與法理上發生嚴重困難、政府雖曾竭力覓求解决辦法、迄未成功、此余所可坦直聲言者也、今茲其他國際問題之尙待解决者、不止一端、所幸最近數日來、此等問題、已較有解决希望、際此時機、苟有問題、凡足以引起國際嚴重爭執者、深望任何方面、均不予提出也、至於原料分配、務求平均一項問題、如由國聯會召集會議、加以討論、則我國政府、自願加入討論焉、」艾登嗣又論及歐洲大局、謂「我國對於歐洲若干部份、負有若干義務、自屬實情、但此非謂我國對於歐洲其他部份所發生之事件、卽漠然視之、毫不關切也、試問歐洲一旦發生衝突、其能使此戰禍、限於一隅、而不延及全歐乎、抑吾人所遭遇之問題中、尙有一方面、務須啟及、卽歐洲各國、今未有願為他國而作戰者是也、」</p>
<p>艾登最後言及軍備問題、並批評反對派所採態度、謂「吾人提交下議院請求核准之擴充軍備計畫、在事實上、决不用於與國聯會盟的及巴黎非戰公約相抵觸之途、而僅以供本國自衛、或援助被侵略國之用而已、就余觀察、軍備限制之時機、或可早日蒞臨、有非一般人意料所及者、良以各國經濟負擔鉅額軍費、已戚不勝、决難久持故也、」</p>
<p>艾登結論、就今日世界各民治國所負重大責任、約略加以闡述、詞畢，反對派自由黨領袖辛克萊繼起發言、對於外相所稱、表示滿意、保守黨議員前外相奧斯丁張伯倫亦起立致詞、對於德國政策、抨擊頗力、謂「德國現有收回戰前殖民地之意、須知該國政府、在其國內、對於本國人民、猶拒不予以公民權利、夷視歧遇、曾奴隸之不若、今若以另一民族、置於此種政府管轄之下、結果所屆、余殊不願分負其咎、德國去年所行政策、及其繼續不斷所提出之要求、皆足使人訾議、我國在某種情勢之下、恐將不得不加入戰爭、此種情勢、吾人不妨加以說明、卽（一）吾人自衛範圍、包括不列顚帝國全部之防務在內、（二）荷蘭與比利時兩國之獨立、此與法國之獨立與安全、有唇齒相依之勢是也、」自由黨領袖前首相路易喬治、起而為德國辯護、並抨擊法國政策、謂法國大置軍備、增造要塞、彼德國所以整軍經武不遺餘力者、職是故也云、</p>
<p>最後艾登起立發言、為本日辯論作一結束、謂政府並未禁止英屬直布羅陀港、勿以煤油供給西班牙艦隊、議員有詢及政府對於國聯會盟的修改問題、究採何種態度者、艾登答稱、「吾人對於國聯會結構、不欲提議大事改革任何行動、凡國聯會會員國、根據全體國家所簽定之盟的、一致贊同所應採行者、吾人無不準備參加云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>南京通信、京市財政、自馬市長接事以來、加意整頓、稅收日見起色、茲將各項整理情形、分述如下、</p>
<p>營業稅</p>
<p>關於營業稅、京市財政局訂定改善征收辦法如下、（一）防止漏稅及短報稅額、派員分區挨戶調查、其未報稅者、隨時飭令照章塡報、復由社會局工務局及衛生事務所協助該局、凡商戶至各該機關申請開業登記時、卽由各該機關通知該局派員前往調查、辦理以來、效果頗佳、漏稅商戶日見减少、稅收日有增益（二）飭令各商每年照章換證、派員隨時曉諭各商戶依期報換稅瞪、以符定章、（三）撤銷恊收公會、京市營業稅、以前委託各業公會協收彙解、施行以來、多有未能遵章辦理、現為淸除積弊起見、採取逐漸撤銷辦法、計在開辦時原有恊收公會六十餘起、現已撤銷三十餘起、僅存二十餘起、其已撤銷各業、由該局直接征收、經力加整頓、稅收均有起色、其尚未撤銷恊收者、現仍賡續辦理撤銷、以期全部收回、而資劃一、（四）營造業改按短期營業征稅、原按長年課稅之營造業、悉數改按短期營業征稅、隨時依照工務局通知各商所包工程造價數征稅、實行以來、頗著成效、</p>
<p>菸酒牌照稅</p>
<p>菸酒牌照稅、自二十三年度改歸京市府接辦後、乃於二十四年夏季派員切實調查、分別照章糾正、本年春季飭令各菸酒稅戶嗣後應按季據實塡報營業狀况、以資考覈、而杜取巧、經此次整理後、違章營業者、日見减少、稅收頓呈起色</p>
<p>牙稅</p>
<p>現在辦理牙稅、除嚴查各戶營業狀况、一一照章加以糾正、幷規定新申請之牙行、均須取具保結外、其舊有牙行、仍須一律補保、以後每年換照時、並應換保一次、以昭愼重、實行以來、收效亦鉅、按京市各項稅捐、經積極整理後、較前均有增加、綜計二十四年度（二十四年七月至二十五年六月）捐稅收入、計二百五十一萬六千六百三十二元六角、比較二十三年度之二百二十萬零八千零零四元一角一分、增加三十萬零八千六百二十八元五角六分、此外二十四年度市產收入、計二十六萬一千九百零六元一角二分、比較二十三年度之二十二萬五千四百五十九元六角八分、增加三萬六千四百四十六元四角四分、現京市財政局仍繼績整理、同時實施（一）嚴厲考核征收、（二）設法養成民衆納稅習慣、（三）厲行舉發隱漏稅捐給獎辦法、務使人民之所出、涓滴歸公、政府合法之稅收、日有增益、至將來計劃、京市財政局已大致擬定如左、</p>
<p>一·改良征收房捐辦法、京市關於房捐征收區域、除下關浦口兩處派有征收員六員征收各該管區域房捐外、城內劃分五十五區、每區均派征收員一員、携帶庫據、直接收捐、但每有疲玩捐戶、藉詞延宕、抗不淸繳、以致積欠甚鉅、茲該局為改良收捐辦法起見、擬將京市應收房捐、委託銀行代收、以養成人民自行納稅之習慣、其辦法先擇定曾經設立支行最多之銀行、與訂合同、載明條欵、一面將每期應征房捐數額、由該局逕行通知各捐戶、限期向就近銀行照數繳納、如逾期不繳、則由局分別追加滯納罰金、以儆抗延、</p>
<p>二·復查房捐、京市房捐、自二十三年復查以後、迄今已隔兩年之久、其間因開闢馬路、建築變遷、以及產權遞嫂等種種關係、雖隨時均經派員詳細調查、然以區域遼闊、難免無隱匿情事、該局誠恐曠日持久、房捐行將受其影響、本年度擬遴派幹員、分別淸查、藉杜隱漏、而增捐收、</p>
<p>三·改善稽征方法、京市財政局核定房捐、多係根據征收人員之報告、究竟有無疏忽遺漏之處、無從考核、茲該局擬按月由稽征人員、將警局戶籍冊、與該局捐戶變遷情形、加以核對、如有不符、卽行澈查、俾免遲延遺漏、</p>
<p>四·整理營業稅、經該局擬具整理計劃如下、（一）擬派員隨時檢查各商戶賬冊、加蓋圖記、以防假賬、京市商戶、每年應納營業稅、係以其所備賬册紀載之資本額、或全年營業收入額、為核定之根據、惟狡黠商人、常預製僞賬、以圖取巧、為預防計、該局擬隨時派員檢查各戶賬冊、加盖印章、以資識別、而杜僞造、（二）擬勵行商戶變動調查登記、商戶之改組加記遷移閉歇、或新開頂替者、變動甚多、該局鑒於苟無明確之登記、嬗變日久、稽核無從、故為改善起見、擬卽製調查登記冊一種、分發各區調查員、遇有變動時、隨時登記呈報、以憑核辦，（三）擬商請警廳凡商戶閉歇、隨時通知、以便追欠、該局以閉歇商戶、多未照章呈報、其欠稅未淸者、往往無法追繳、茲擬製訂通知書一種、商請輕縣轉飭各局、凡商戶呈報閉歇時、卽由各該局照塡通知、以憑追欠、而免投失、（四）舉辦牙行代報營業稅、京市現僅征收設店營業者之營業稅、對於市內及外方投行商人之臨時營業、因調查不易、尚未課征此項營業稅、如糧食樹木雞鴨猪隻等、為數頗夥、該局擬責令各牙行負責代報賣方營業稅、以裕稅收、（五）開征應征朱征之各業營業稅、京市娛樂塲業，地產公司業。及其他應征營業稅、尚未課征之各業、將次第籌劃開征、</p>
<p>五·淸查菸酒牌照稅、該局為澈底整理該項稅收起見、擬於最短期間、實行總調查一次、以期周密、而裕稅收、</p>
<p>六·整理牙稅、該局對於牙稅整理計劃、擬於最短期間、令飭各牙行於換照時、隨繳行主相片二張、分別粘貼牙行及保結上、以杜朋充頂替之弊、</p>

<h3>實部科長吳聞天談　租界工檢繼續交涉　工部局執照制度碍难执行　政治外交立塲應顧及人道　盼領團重加考慮勿執成見</h3>
<p>中央社云、本市工廠檢查、迭經市府與公共租界當軸交涉、已擬具協定草案、卽將解决、詎領事團忽提出異議、遂又停頓、實業部勞工司科長吳聞天、因事來滬、便與各方交換意見、記者特往訪晤、叩詢一切、當經發表談話如决、</p>
<p>協定草案　領團反對</p>
<p>上海公共租界工廠檢查問題、經過五年之交涉、始于本年六月、由工部局與上海市政府共同擬定、公共租界工檢協定草案、而審查其中之內容、足可推知中國政府之委曲求全、為大多數工人之幸福計、不惜與工部局之意見妥協、而工部局亦深體中國政府之苦心、予以諒解、故此恊定之成立、殊非易易、吾人正擬拭目以俟工檢實施於租界、而數千萬工入之生活、從而改善也、不圖據報載該項恊定、方經工部局董事會通過、而領事團方面、竟認為該項協定、能致廢止領判權國條約特權之一部、要求修改、據領事團之意見、以為該項恊定之辦法、只能執行於租界內中國工廠、及無領判權國之工廠、至於享有領判權國之工廠、則為洋涇浜章程所賦予之權利、處理檢查事宜、應由工部局對於此等工廠、採用發給執照辦法、於執照上訂以保護工人及檢查廠內各事、</p>
<p>領團意見　實不共允</p>
<p>故若照領事團之意見而見諸事實、則是在一個工廠檢查機關之下、對於同一國之工人、在同一區域內、而竟同時執行兩種不同之法律、（一）中國工廠法、（適用於中國工廠及無　領判權國之工廠、）與（二）工部局執照、（適用於有領判權國之工廠、）此種辦法、是否公允、殊不値一辯、良以執照規定、决不能包括中國工廠法之全部內容、同時執照制度之弊端叢生、早已為人所共見者、曾憶一九三二年、工部局乘納稅人年會之便、接開特別會議、修正洋涇浜章程附則第三十四條、卽以執照辦法而獲取工廠檢查權、當時中國人民反對、中國政府亦表示不承認、卽工部局自己亦知發給執照有種種困難、而未能執行、前事不遠、今豈忘之、而領事團現在仍舊事重提、以昔日尚不能施行之辦法、而以施諸今日、孰敢必其有效、</p>
<p>工檢在謀　工人福利</p>
<p>領事團之、意見，自政治外交之立塲、吾人固不便有所論列、惟檢查工廠、是為工人謀福利、乃整個社會的經濟的及入道主義的事件、非政治外交所得而掩飾者、該意見之實現、足致工廠檢查、在上海租界受到極大之阻碍、而租界內數十萬工人之生活、仍無澈底改善之可能、就社會經濟之觀點、及人道主義之立塲殊不能不引為絕大憾事、假使各國領事諸公、能一一親歷租界內設備不善之外國工廠、一覩工人之苦况、未必不有動於心、而改變其墨守政治外交之態度也、而况本歷史之觀念、政治乃隨社會經濟潮流而變遷、今日盛倡現代文明之法治、又安能使吾人不顧及人道耶、再則此等有領事裁判權之國家、其國內均有工廠檢查之悠久歷史、於其國內工人之保護、亦可謂無微不至、推己及人、當於新辦工檢之中國、就其良好經騐、予以援助、何能藉口政治外交、而加以阻撓、尚謂親善合作、其誰能信、</p>
<p>輿論贊助　實施工檢</p>

<h3>上海之蛋業（續）　（上海工商業槪况這卅三）</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（六）營業情形</p>
<p>上海蛋類營業，冰蛋由廠家直接出口，蛋製品則經出口行之手，在昔售與外商，有担保其貨四個月不致腐壞之例，致一般刁詐外商，吹毛求疵，任意退貨，且以外滙行市之不安定，外商視、先令之漲跌，以作收貨退貨之伸縮，蛋商因此而破產者實繁有徒，嗣經公議取消保貨惡例，銷貨方面免除損失，去年政府改革幣制，蛋商以外匯安定，益有保障、</p>
<p>營業前途，綜合本所調查所得，尚抱樂觀，其一政府對於蛋業頗加扶掖，如减低稅率，指導改進，官商殊能合作，共二我國任何蛋產品，均屬優良，外商無瑕疵可尋，其三該業領袖鄭源興君等，曾幾度赴歐美考察蛋業產銷情形，均稱熟悉，知己知彼，易於制人，其四同業已覺悟競爭之非計，相互誠意合作，卽外商蛋廠，亦另立名義，加入上海蛋業同業公會，至於各國抵制華蛋，我政府當局已會同蛋業鈕子，紛謀對策，有此數因，該業命運不致蹈絲茶之覆轍也。</p>
<p>（七）蛋之市價</p>
<p>蛋價全視供求為轉移，其次節令亦有關係，大抵冬季漲而夏季跌，冰蛋因直接出口，上海並無行市，茲將去年來上海蛋價比較如左，藉窺趨勢之一斑：鮮蛋逐月扯價表（單位百市斤，元）</p>
<p>（八）上海蛋業的分析</p>
<p>上海蛋業的可分為蛋廠，土法蛋廠，出口行，蛋行四類，中以蛋行歷史最久，承餘堂公所卽該業舊時集團，其後與蛋廠聯絡成立上海蛋業公會，會址在百老匯路山壽里一一二七號，加入會員達三十餘家。土法蛋廠亦有蛋廠公會之組織，會址在天津路一四五弄一九號，聞兩會為團結起見，將謀合併。茲詳述各類內容如下：</p>
<p>蛋廠現有冰蛋廠六家，洋商五，華商一，各廠資本雄厚，間有兼營各種動物產品，班達資格最老，專營蛋類，英商怡和，培林，除上海設廠外，靑島亦有分廠，華商茂昌公司，為今日我國唯一之冰蛋廠，總公司在上海黃浦路二二九號，分公司在靑島商河路四號，內部組織分進貨部，廠務部，出口部，運輸部。並設冷藏堆棧部，在英倫設有分公司，各國均有代理人，因資力充足，人才傑出，信用頗佳，得有今日之地位。</p>

<h3>暑天的中裝</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>暑天穿的衣服，自以「舒適」「簡易」「輕爽」為最佳條件，我們國產的衣料和裁製的式樣，恰巧合乎這種標準，母怪旅滬的西人，亦在改穿中裝，在馬路上大搖大擺的踱共西式方步了（見前日本埠新聞）的確！國產的衣料，像紡綢香雲紗夏布等，輕薄堅靱，沾汗不黏，而且中裝的式樣，寬大凉爽，舒適異常；穿脫也十分便利，而且價格便宜，十元左右的一件大褂，十元左右的一套衫褲，已是頭等貨色了，便是洗濯也十分簡易，家庭中伶俐的僕人，也能洗得淸潔，燙得整貼。反觀穿西裝的便沒有這樣的舒適經濟了。西裝的衣料，總是白嗶嘰白帆布等，厚厚的穿在身上，一些也得不着凉爽。而且褲子的腰身，又是和身體同其尺寸，加上揷袋等，竟和中裝一條夾褲差不多，你說穿上了熱不熱呢？上身薄薄的襯衫，雖說是寬大舒適，不過你在塲面應酬，正式酬酢，又是不能光穿襯衫的，加上了領帶或領結，再穿上一件厚厚的上裝，眞是熱得要命。而且一套起碼的西裝，須要二十元左右；還加上洗濯不是人人會的，拿到洗染店去，也要好幾角錢，你想費了這許多錢，得到一個不舒服，眞何苦來咧！所以在暑天我勸穿中裝的，不要見人眼紅，學穿西裝；便是穿西裝的也不妨改穿國產中裝，比較一下，到底誰來得舒適便利呢？</p>
<p>不過中裝也有一些不便，那大褂實在太長，上車下車，走路做事，太不便利，從前馬子貞將軍曾提倡把大褂的長度截至膝蓋為度，這眞是便利美觀。</p>
<h3>貢獻話　國貨界自己先起來服用國貨</h3>
<p>— 仰菲</p>
<p>吾常說提倡國貨，與其靠人，不如靠自己，與其勸國貨界以外的人，不如靠國貨界以內的人。尤其是從我服務國貨界的人，一致躬行實踐的做起。比較為有效，而容易推行。</p>
<p>第一種辦法　由國貨界組織一個大集團，凡是服務國貨界的人，個個必須購用本國貨個個都須購用這個集團工廠生產的國貨。凡是購用集團工廠所生產的國貨，個個都有享受優待廉價或折扣的權利。</p>
<p>第二種辦法　凡是服務國貨界的同志，個個都須官誓服用國貨，蚤家老少男女，一律服用國貨，如查出購用非國貨的，廠店領袖應有最嚴重之處罰，或竟辭退或竟解僱。</p>
<p>第三種辦法　服務國貨界的人，所有人情往來，慶吊禮金，一律用國貨禮券，凡持國貨禮券至國貨公司或工廠購物的，應予以特別之優待。</p>
<p>第四種辦法　凡國貨工廠間彼此應相互紹介出品，使各廠同人都有購用本國貨之習慣，同時各廠間訂立契的，各定優待條件，俾彼此各得便宜之貨物。</p>
<p>第五種辦法　各工廠公司組織合作社，凡社員之衣食住行，都以服用國貨為原則。以後視購用國貨額之多少，以定獎金之厚薄。</p>
<p>此國貨界自身之工作，亦為提倡國貨之基本工作，實則亦為服用國貨之起碼工作。如此點能實行，國貨前途，尚有光明希望。否則空口說話，無裨實際，提倡兩字，還是等於廢話。</p>
<h3>提倡國貨與復興農村</h3>
<p>— 唐增庚</p>
<p>我國號稱以農立國，農民要占着全人口的大多數，自從農村破產的厄運遭到以後，農村是呈現了死色，這一方面果然是為了天災人禍的橫逆之來，被使農村成了一個不可收拾的局面，另一方面呢？我們不能不說是帝國主義者經濟侵略的巨爪伸到了農村，而使農村蒙上了無限止的灰色，因此，農村是長期消沉，農民也就受到了永久的痛苦，以農立國的這句話，也許要起着根本的搖動吧？</p>
<p>這裏我們暫且放開農村破產的第一個原因，不說—天災人禍—因為這不是本文範圍內所要叙述的，現在，讓我們來談談帝國主義者經濟侵略而使農村破產的第二個原因。</p>
<p>無可諱言的，帝國主義者的經濟侵略，使全中國的每一個份子，都遭到了厄運，以中國的原料製造成物品，再來販賈與中國，這樣的一過手之間，侵略者的錢囊為滿，而中國的金錢却是源源外流國家的財富，怎不要引起極度的恐慌呢？農村的經濟怎不要感覺到無限的窘迫呢？所以，我們要復興農村，不得不以提倡國貨來入手。</p>
<p>要國貨深入農村，要農村獲得復興，更要使農村中帝國主義者經濟侵略的絕跡，我以為應要注意下列數點：</p>
<p>一，提倡國貨製造業使農村經濟可以復蘇：要使國貨的深入農村，我們應該努力的來提倡國貨製造業的到農村去，使每一個閒散的農民，可以獲得生活的憑藉，而農村的經濟也可以漸臻佳境，這是需要政府當局的加倍督倡，多設立國貨製造工廠，使農村可以恢復他的生氣</p>
<p>二，創辦國貨服務社，使農民樂用國貨：我們承認，外貨的信仰心，現在已深深的影在農民的腦海裏，他們以服用洋貨為無上的光榮，這我們可說是農村破產的一個大問題，所以，現在我們要復興農村，希望社會人士，合力來創辦國貨服務社，儘量將國貨深入農村儘量的介紹國貨給農民們，而且還得加以努力的勸說，使農民們樂用國貨，除剷掉信仰洋貨的心理</p>
<p>三，設立國貨講習所，使農民獲得國貨的智識：</p>
<p>這一項，我們是需要從事於農村敎育的先生們，請他們來盡一些力，聯合了幾個學校，設立一個國貨講習所，呌農民來聽講灌輸給他們極淺近的國貨智識，不必求高深，只要求通俗，使他們可以明瞭農村破產的主因，使他們知道服用國貨的智識，這樣的諄諄勸說，農民的對於國貨智識，自會漸漸的提高而厭棄洋貨了。</p>
<p>雖然，農村破產的救濟，並不能僅僅以上述三點可以達到目的的，可是至少可以在復興農村的總動員下，得到一些助力，在這裏，深深地盼望，政府當局，社會人士，以及負有救濟農村責任的先生們，太太們，來努力的挽回農村破產的厄運，努力的加緊着我們農村的復興</p>
<h3>紀無綫電船發明人譚玉田君</h3>
<p>— 寸</p>
<p>南京譚玉田君是一位英俊的靑年，今年只三十歲左右，原籍廣東，旅居東北多年，研究電器機械垂七八載之久，著有無綫電原理，修理法，設計法，綫路圖，以及二重探波設計法各書，他是目擊東北失陷時喪心慘目的景狀，所以發奮研究，以備他日為國家出力。</p>
<p>他試騐無綫電船的動機，是開始於三年前，到去年八九月間，才開始製造，造成一架長三，五英尺，排水一立方公尺，載重六十二磅的小型無綫電船，船上除馬達外，裝有收報機，控制器等，在試騐時，岸上裝一波長七十四公尺的發報機，按捺機件，卽可使電船發生感應，左右進退自如，將來擴大後，還可裝發炮，放烟幕，打探照燈等機件，完成一艘完善的電艦。</p>
<p>譚君因經濟關係，所以現在口以四百元的代價造成這架小電艇，前幾天在首都玄武湖試騐的時候，譚君站在岸上，旋動發報機，那電艇漸漸離岸，要它東就東，要它倒退就倒退，他的初步研究，總算很滿意地完成了</p>
<p>現在譚君是預備進行他第二步大計劃了，他希望和交通部等機關合作，並希望政府予以物質上精神上的助力，完成他的志願，此外他又在研究一種一公尺至五公尺的超短波電機，可以隨身携帶，和數英里外通話，半年後可告成功云。</p>

<h3>世運選手團隨征記　（第四信上）　中央社特派員馮有眞寄</h3>
<p>團旗永遠照耀在太陽裏的不列顚帝國、當我們走出國門後、眞感覺得他的偉大、自離上海、沿途經過香港·新加坡·都是他的殖民地、現在到了錫蘭島的首邑哥倫坡、不久又要到印度的孟買、以後還要經過埃及、無不是他的領土、歐亞間海程中的地帶、幾於完全被他囊括了、以區區三島為根據地的英國、能這樣偉大的發展、這使我國老大國民的國民、對之惟有慚愧得無地自容的、</p>
<p>錫蘭島位於印度的南端、是英國直轄的領地、哥倫坡是錫籣島的首邑、當印度洋航路的中心、也是印度洋岸第一要港、英國設總督治理錫蘭島、總督就駐在哥倫坡、郵船在七月四日的正午、航抵哥倫坡、哥倫坡面臨印度洋、為防波濤衝擊、並避風浪起見、錫蘭政府特在洋中建築兩條石堤、包圍成一個小灣、石堤的工程、十分雄偉宏大、石堤的外面、洶湧的波濤冲擊着、激起了一丈多高的水花、同噴水泉一樣的一陣一陣的降落下來、我們雖然已厭惡了航海生活、可是對這樣景色、祗覺得是壯麗可愛石堤的裏面、，一泓碧水、平靜無瀾、停了許多巨輪軍艦、</p>
<p>郵船在正午靠停灣內、因檢查護照、到下午二時、才始下船、由停船處到岸上、相距有數百公尺、郵船公司預備一艘小輪、迎接登岸、有許多人沒有趕上這艘渡輪、另乘營業渡輪、須納費一個盧比、（錫蘭幣名的合國幣一元三角）都大呼倒霉不止、</p>
<p>哥倫坡沒有好多華僑、碼頭上冷淸淸的、沒有人來歡迎、所以上岸後、都自由行動、郵船預定到下午八時啟椗、很有充裕的時間、可以遊覽全市許多經營汽車業的主人、來兜生意、講定遊覽全市、的三小時、每車六人、取費一磅、於是大家都分批結隊的乘車出發、也有許多省錢的朋友、就在附近踱踱馬路、逛逛店請、</p>
<p>記者同中央日報的儲安平君·考察團吳德懋·邵汝幹·江良規·侯洛荀等四君、同乘一車、先到電報局發了一僩電報、發電後、汽車夫開到車姑去加汽油、車停的時候、許多皮膚黑得發光的土人拿了幾朶花來給你、我們給了一毛錢還是嚕囌不已、這種變相的乞丐、到處皆是、如果在街上走的話、更將被他們糾纏不淸了、</p>
<p>汽車過市轉了三個鐘頭、走馬看花都說不上、現在祗就哥倫坡表面上的情形說一點、給沒有到過的人、以一個簡單的輪廓吧、</p>
<p>哥倫坡的馬路、也很平坦寬闊、大概在所有帝國主義的殖民地中、這一點點物質文明、總是可以享受的、許多高大的洋棧、矗立着把他形成一個摩登的都市、但是土人的住宅、則矮小齷齪、絕不調和相稱、最可愛的是許多高大的樹木、葱鬱成蔭、到處都好像花園似的、</p>
<p>街上的交通工具、除少數的汽車與人力車外、還是以牛車為主、牛車的構造很笨重、兩個鐵的巨輪中、夾着一塊木板、上面用蔗蓆搭成一個半圓形的蓬蓋、矮小一點的屋、還沒有牠那樣高、視車的大小輕重、用一隻或兩隻牛去拖、滿街上蹣跚的走着、絡繹不絕、不但把街道顯現得很擁擠、並且牛糞遍地皆是、臭不可當、尤其是小的街道、令人作嘔、</p>
<p>哥倫坡的烏鴉、大概可算是最胆大的為類了、街道上空塲上到處都是、牠們對於人固然毫無畏懼、就是汽車急馳而過的時候、也不過同那班老資格的馬路巡閱使一樣、走兩步讓一讓、並不展翅高飛、大家看見這樣情形、都笑着說、哥倫坡可稱為烏鴉世界、</p>
<p>哥倫坡並沒有什麽特別可使人欣賞留戀的地方、我們做了三小時的馬路巡閱使、祗停留了兩個地方、第一個是維多利亞公園、全園範圍很大、林木葱翠、花草茂盛？景色十分幽靜、園旁的市政廳、為全市最偉大的建築之一、園內白人與土人遊樂的地方、界限分得很嚴、附近一帶向是白人的住宅、汽車夫向我們解釋的時候、顯出很羨慕的神惰、第二個停留的地方是釋迦牟尼廟、到廟裏去的人、都要脫掉鞋子、我們也在入口處照着辦、由一個廟祝（其實是引導的人員）陪着進去、廟成八角形、範圍並不大、四圍是走廊、中間是佛堂、佛堂中塑了一尊大佛、和數尊小佛、壁上畫了許多關於佛敎故事的圖畫、有的作近代的裝飾、大家都笑着說、菩薩也摩登化起來了、佛堂的西面、還有幾間廂房、有一間塑了一尊大理石的觀音像、很精巧、走廊中還有一尊二丈多長的臥佛、可稱偉大、這個廟與中國廟宇不同的地方、就是裏面並無香燭、並且一塵不染、淸潔異常、絕不像中國廳字那像臘蹋的樣子、我們在佛堂的時候、這位引導的人、給予各人一朶鮮花、說這是可以帶給幸運的、大家當然都一笑置之、出廟的時候、向我們要錢、有許多人給他一塊錢也有給幾角錢的、穿鞋子的時候、又有許多土人爭着替你穿、當然也離不了錢、在土人的眼光中大的再也沒有比錢更重要的東西了、</p>
<p>印度與錫蘭的「加力」鷄、是很馳名的、大家吃膩了船上的大山米、都去嘗嘗異味、一盤飯寡面放了一塊鷄、取價一盧比、但是並無「加力」、另外要一盤「加力」鷄、又是半個盧比、味道並不見得怎樣奇特、眞是上當不小、</p>
<p>錫蘭以產珍珠寳石茶黑鉛聞名於世、汽車夫把我們開到一家珠寳店去、舖面雖不很大、但是裏面陳列了許多珍珠寳石、眞是琳瑯滿目、美不勝收、店員招待十分慇懃、拿這樣拿那樣給你看、並且說價錢如何如何公道、到歐洲至少要賺幾倍利息、但是我們誰都不想做珠寳商、結果祗買了幾張風景畫片、應酬了事、</p>
<p>椶色人種的錫蘭土人、皮膚黑漆發光、因為喜歡吃檳榔的緣故、嘴唇染得鮮紅、眞像血盆、貧苦的土人、上身都不穿衣服、下身圍着一條布以代褲子、男女都科頭跣足、但是學生則鞋襪整齊、顯現這個民族多少也是前進的、土人搬運貨物、除最笨重的用牛車外、其餘都是用頭頂着走、我們在街上常常可以看見很多男男女女、頭上頂着一袋很高大的東西、輕巧地走着、一些也不現吃力的樣子、　（未完）</p>

<h3>華商仍有了結　滙市欲緊又挫</h3>
<p>滙市昨以華商仍塞、過程欲緊而遭阻挫、查晨初以海外電告、倫敦大條近遠俱縮一二五、脚地謂收市後在掛牌〇六二五之上有成交、最後照掛牌有買戶、而賣方則在〇六二五等訊、紐的銀市勿動、蒙得里遠期銀價升五毫至二釐半、倫教生金縮半便士、英對美勿動、美對英縮三一二五、英對法勿動、美對法降二五、中央銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、海關金單位勿動、匯市晨開近期賣價英匯一先令二便士四三七五、美匯三十元一八七五、與前收相較、計英美俱平、開後日行扒結束匯、匯豐銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、形勢頗定、入後華商仍有了結、白銀平衡稅揭曉縮半分、然因銀行維持、大勢尚平入後銀行互有掉期勢更徘徊、後市銀行扒英塞美、華商仍有了結、趨勢迄難振作、中途銀行略有對做而盤旋、迫收盤近期賣價、英匯一先令二便士四三七五弱、美匯三十元一八七五、較之前收計英匯緊六十四分之一、美金則平、遠期亦然、華商略塞先令及美金二十萬元、今將一天成交錄後、</p>

<h3>證劵　一氣呼成　甲種債竟達七十元　回風頓起…結果仍漲起九角</h3>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所九月份期貨開始上塲、市况繼續趨漲、惟過高之後、稍稍引起回風、致有兎起鶻洛之象、甲種竟達七十元、一起呼成、似覺過猛、致有多方獲利結出者頗多、大漲小回、趨勢未免頽萎、惟漲跌不勻、顯有多方專事對於甲種一味抬價、以亂人目、前途漲風雖有、想當有限、果能站定一時、亦多方之福也、昨日經過、開盤漲風繼續頗勁、愈後愈猛、八月份甲種狂漲一元二角半、九月份開始登塲、卽見一律開出、且遠期較近期為高、可見塲上多頭心思頗濃、甲種因抬至過高、致演倒掛、破綻稍露、回風卽起、次盤四十八及五十一號以及四號三十三五十四號等、先後相繼賣出、回風頓起、戊種穩定而不漲、趨勢已改變途徑、人氣頓餒、乙種跌六角為最多、而甲種祇小三角、故跌風尚不致　起也、昨日市價結果、除九月份新做不計外、八月份仍係一致上漲三五角至九角不等、成交總共計八百六十九萬五千元、今日為七月份期貨交劃、停市一天、將共漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紗花　散多出籠　紗市絕少進展</h3>
<p>紗市續挫、且跌風殊熾、蓋以交割後多頭無意加碼、同時有一部份多方紛紛出籠、於是空方益覺活躍、市照跌勢益强、但現紗交易、南部漸形發展、惟市塲人心仍難振作也、</p>
<p>標紗續跌元外</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、市塲籌碼鬆懈、買者殊形缺乏、人心不振、兼之流言孔繁皆屬不利多方、市盤跌勢愈見嚴厲、各月均跌一元至一元二·三角、二三盤們屬不靈、迨至收盤、遠月跌風尤劇、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌一元八角、查賣出者錦昌一千零五十包、明德七百五十包、振大九百五十包、合興一千二百包、賡豐一千零五十包、森康五百包、長餘六百五十包、愼記七百五十包、泰昌八百五十包、長豐一千四百五十包、潤康一千六百五十包、協成一千二百包、永昌一千四百包、信誠一千五百包、買進澄記一千九百包、德大七百包、通記七百五十包、聚興八百包、裕大一千八百包、大豐七百五十包、達記一千五百五十包、永裕八百五十包、豐泰七百五十包、頤大一千九百包、大昌成六百包、茲將半日間最高低及收盤價列左、</p>

<p>現紗銷路尚好、查全日各帮買去統計八百四十五包、售價跌一·二元、各帮買額如下、</p>
<h3>在自然的力量支配下　新棉拋賣更湧</h3>
<p>棉市陳花在跌、局勢異常衰弱、良以市上空氣惡劣、在自然的力量支配下、陳花殊覺不利、故市價愈難支持、新花因邇來氣候順調、發育健全、拋賣者更形活動、惟印棉掉期步步上漲云、</p>
<p>陳花小去元半</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、美棉雖跌二至七磅音、印棉仍漲二羅比七五至一二羅比、大阪三品花跌六·七角、遠跌二·三角、市塲人氣甚虛、因謠言興繁、同時天氣良好、新棉生產美滿、於是空頭聲勢浩大、八月陳花氣勢愈見衰敗、結果陳花比上日收盤價猛跌一元半、新花大跌四·五·六角、查賣出恒益二千五百担、振大一千六百担、合興四千八百担、豐泰一千八百担、愼記二千四百担、仁豐一千二百担、大昌成二千四百担、潤康二千四百担、協成一千五百担、永昌二千担、長和六千一百担、買進德大一千五百担、大孚一千一百担、澄記六千四百担、通記二千三百担、聚興一千二百担、達記一千九百祖、森康一千五百担、同豐五千四百担、益昶一千五百担、長豐一千六百担、恒昌一千五百担、瑞源一千一百担、茲將半日間最高低及收盤價列左、</p>
<p>現棉廠辦停頓</p>
<p>現棉消費、依然停頓、廠方多抱觀望、來源姚花二百八十包云、</p>
<h3>太倉附近棉田增加</h3>
<p>本年度太倉及附近四處棉田、大見增加、蓋以棉價昻騰、鄉農樂於種植、江陰縣增加二成、其他各縣增一成、田畝共計一百五十六萬畝、各方生產狀况異常茂盛、此後天氣如無暴風雨摧殘、當有近年稀有之收成也、</p>
<h3>美棉回跌印棉上漲　三品紗花略小</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、利物浦消息良好、經紀商及外商買進、上週奧克拉霍馬缺雨、各月漲十八至二十二磅音、其後多頭了結、本地帮紐奧崙及棉農一致套賣、奧克拉霍馬預測有雨、雖魯意西亞那海濱及白哈馬附近有風潮、中部有雨、仍不能挽回頽勢、業外買戶有限、同業大都觀望、以待新棉情形、現貨堅定、紡織品漸呆、收盤平疲、計現貨跌七磅音、期貨跌一至七磅音、英棉現貨漲九點、期貨漲四至十點、印棉現貨商、日商及操業者大批買進、遇多頭了結、計平果爾漲二·七五羅比、奧姆辣漲三羅比、白羅溪漲二·二五至三羅比、原電錄左、（二十七日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、二十八日開盤預測、七八月期白羅溪為二百三十三羅比、跌一·七五羅比、四五月期白羅溪為二百二十二羅比、跌一·二五羅比十二正月期輿姆辣為二百零一羅比、跌一·七五羅比、</p>
<p>二十七孟買電、上週自蘭貢方面輸出之棉花數量、共五三五噸、內至漢堡者二五噸、至安體活者一〇噸、至神戶者四八二噸、至梅爾蓬者一八噸、</p>

<p>孟買上週棉業市况不安定</p>
<p>孟買上週棉市、因多頭方面獲得幾等於出口津貼之利益後、重行賣出、致大受影響、結果國外消費者、尤以日本為最、購得廉宜之棉、期貨塲中、極不安定、任何謠傳、足使賣戶傾售、據報有大宗現棉、運往日本、惟因天氣良好、市况仍呆、益雨已得、仍極需要、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>
<p>美棉（單位千包）</p>

<h3>糧食　北埠水脚將加　麵粉獨漲八月期</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份已呈平靜、因本月份已經結價、當無問題、至八月份以下、因洋麥報價、芝加哥回漲三五角、坎拿大好四角零、業內外人心、不免轉定、且以市塲所傳、八月一日起、將加水脚、故津帮連日均有趕裝、市面轉定、當為此故、九月份以下、因新米各處豐收、人心當然顧及、業外多頭、回脫不少、市氣大致平疲、觀察後步、以實際情形推考、後步恐須逐趨下游云、</p>
<h3>現貨商頻頻套入　期麥逐漸回軟</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份初因洋麥報漲三四五角不等、業內外心思、略呈平穩、後以</p>
<p>廠方對於現麥去胃、依然平淡、有現貨之客戶、頻頻套入、因此市氣逐步挫軋、至於遠期書面、每一月份之加値、終在一角左右、未免太巨、故相形之下、人心未免漸漸改觀、日來遠期跌度較猛、原非無故、現麥市况、形式雖仍賓主、骨子已帶鬆落、因廠家祇吃特高貨、中關貨以下、一致不進、昨日各廠所進之特高貨、自四元五角半、决至四角半、計應酬交易三千餘包、惟傳日商方面、則辦去中關貨八九千包、價較申廠所辦略大云、</p>
<p>七月份期麥交割、聞已有廿餘車交進、總數的計六十餘車云、</p>
<h3>客秈川帮振濟去路突廣</h3>
<p>客秈連日到頭不絕、中次有底尤夥、行囤客販莫不急求脫手、中决各檔更願貶價售去、因中次大多發熱、不克再儲、且新米各地已有上市、滬上不日有到、各地來樣均比往年為佳、故人心與市面繼續下趨、昨市本有步跌之象、但突有四川帮在市採辦、市面為之一振、又以川帮為振濟該省災區起見、需胃甚宏、標說須在申辦裝二十萬石、在長江各埠辦十萬石、且屬揀辦中次各檔、以作平糶與散振之需、昨日辦成四千包左右、均屬中關以下各米、全日成交江西米五千七百四十二包、湘米一千一百二十五包、行號自配亦有二千包左右、去路除四川外、本街與浙帮亦有應酬云、</p>
<p>（河南）昨日各帮來源共到十六七號、（貨共三千餘石）、本街銷塲淸淡、包胃僅靑島帮辦六百餘包、故市况續疲、厚早粳及薄稻行情僅眞眞新鮮貨勉强站住、其中市者再跌近角、杜洋尖眼低幾分、陰變元平平、（滬北）昨日河下各路來泊十二三號、市上各貨去胃依然淸淡、白粳價又疲數分、白元平定、薄稻價短近尺、羊埠客秈等、疲中帶定、而去路仍淡薄、其餘各貨價亦疲勢、</p>
<h3>新黃豆外强中乾</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆市况、因榨油廠停辦、人心頓呈不稱、幸本街內地小磨去路不懈、大局尚能維持、但價位緊提幾日、不免引湧來源、所以後情趨勢、暫時未能捉摸、昨計成交城門豆一千二百餘包、都昌豆一百二十包、鄱陽夾靑一百包、餘均未做開、陳豆廠家辦去海州豆千餘包、價開五元零七分、杜豆沙黃、由本街交易三四百包、行情平平、</p>
<h3>疋頭　細布細斜現貨仍缺</h3>
<p>昨布市因紗花疲落之影響、同業心思略見回軟、惟市盤仍非常堅定、細布細斜現貨、艱難如故、粗布因內地帮走銷不暢、客路需胃零星、市勢稍形鬆動、十六磅雙魚粗布、天津帮略有辦去五六十件、價每疋降五分、惟九磅內衣粗布、出品奇缺、現貨價較市盤須加起每疋五分、怡和廠各擋輕磅粗布粗斜、走勢不佳、客帮装货、仍以從前定貨居多、江西帮裝各廠嗶嘰·縐呢·及怡和粗布·漂布·漂斜等貨一百餘件、安徽帮裝大批元色斜紋·嗶嘰·直貢·及白貨細布·細斜·條素府綢等貨、一百餘件、長沙四川帮裝貨最湧、催裝印花絨·直貢·藍布·元斜甚急、本色絨布漂白絨亦已有裝去、蘇綸廠本色絨布、十一磅神　七元四角半、十一磅神虎七元二角半、亦有開出、本年本廠絨布、開盤較去歲加起、每疋一元左右、</p>
<h3>絲茶　美莊絲經在談判中</h3>
<p>昨日紐約絲市、因補空軋高、白廠B字現貨市價、較上週六漲六分、期貨漲五分、此外日絲八三及七五勻度、上海絲曁廣東絲絲、均上漲二分、橫瀆絲價、現期貨品亦隨漲十二元至十七元、里昂絲市、依然呆穩無變、絲交猶寂、申埠昨日白廠絲市、雖無如何進展、然市氣稍蘇、聞有若干美莊絲交、尚在接談中、一俟正式成交、再行報告、</p>
<h3>紅綠茶交易淸淡</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊紅綠茶交易、均趨淸淡、祁門浮樂等路紅茶、僅銷出百餘箱、惟英倫市塲華茶去路尚佳、英茶商尚擬繼續大量搜辦、至綠茶市面、亦無何等起色、普通莊之珍眉綠茶、行家多觀望、市上已囤積一萬五千箱、抽芯珍眉與平水珠茶、市况亦均呆淡、僅針眉一項、去路依然活潑云、</p>
<p>又據茶業公會報吿云、昨日珍眉交易仍然淸淡、各行均持觀望、惟協和稍有進辦、計蝦目價七十至九十元、小針眉價三十三至五十五元、及屯抽價百十三至百十六元、均各有一二百箱辦入、及福時對七十三至七十六元之普通屯珍亦購進百餘箱、觀各茶售價、均較前略低、平水大帮、聞錦隆怡和略有談盤、又錦隆辦高莊頭米七百餘件、價六十三四元、協和亦成交三百件、價五十七至六十元、觀市另色珠茶價堅、而大帮反疲云、</p>
<h3>糖市　枝洋白汕存吿乏</h3>
<p>昨糖市因據汕頭航空訊、粗砂白要售二十四元、故趨勢轉佳、公會劃盤、二四粗砂白現貨呌原價、轉口貨升一角、陳貨六元八角、新貨六元九角、東白轉口貨（J）嘜六元七角、TK嘜六元五角半、ET嘜六元五角、均有成交、餘無上落、潮糖因粗白高漲、枝洋等土白均就地應銷、無貨可辦、靑糖僅存千數百包、赤砂存三千餘包、產價均挺、無鬆可望、因此申市更緊、號貨提靑十二元半、黃崗靑十二元、續開四百餘包、綿赤十五元一二角至十四元八角、開百餘包、廣帮開惠州赤百餘包、十四元、比升二角、惠州洋七十餘包、十五元六角、建帮開韶安白二百餘包、十八元八角至五角、比升三角、興化帮開明京赤十四元二角、京赤十三元至十二元半、成交二百餘包、枝洋因汕存無貨、號盤野呌十八元未成、</p>
<h3>南北貨　川榨菜開盤升元許　——津紅棗係去年產品——</h3>
<p>四川榨菜、近以粤局已定、走銷漸趨活潑、如上牌樂磧菜叙裕通鴻利源兩牌、前開過二十三元七八角、現市二十五元、已乏貨可開、涪陵菜前開十九元至十八元半者現以二十元至十九元開過六七百場、查客貨申存的有萬場之　、市勢有續緊之象、昨行盤高牌樂磧菜呌二十二三元、涪陵菜十七八元、（昨報所載津訊新黑棗因前年尚有陳貨、故去年貨稱為新貨、並非本屆新出、附此更正、以免誤會、）</p>
<h3>五金　英鋼板供不敷銷</h3>
<p>英鋼板自海外定價趨漲後、本埠同業購定極少、故目下進口不多、惟近來客帮生意及廠家突旺、因此市貨不够分銷、而繁銷品如半分·七釐半等、幾有斷檔之虞、標準開價因人心良好、故均扳守、以待善價、昨日開出四百八十餘擔、由北蘇州路一帶五金行拋出其價半分每擔售七元二角半、七釐半六元八角、一分六元七角、分半以上開六元五角、較之前盤價則已好起一角出零、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （周亮超）</p>
<p>斗室中一燈如豆，它光亮的程度自很微弱的，但已具有給予人以效用的功能。我們只消把自己的本能，發揮到有益於社會的事業方面，不能說效果怎樣偉大，我相信心靈上慰藉的快感，是可以獲得多量的收穫的。朋友：不要藐視自己能力的渺小，燈光的散佈，便是我們每一個人生命中活力的象徵。</p>
<p>一錠小小的墨，我們休得小覷它沒有偉大的用度，如果細細地對它透視一下，在文化的進展上和藝術的流傳上說，已够稱一個「不辱使命」的有力者。在這一點上，我們可以得到一個很好的教訓：就是不要認為被人利用便是個弱者，有價值而有够人利用才能的人，是值得我們頌贊和效法的。</p>
<p>這幾天的知了，大肆權威，噪聲震耳，攪亂人們的甯靜，很够煩厭。在實際上一些也找不到它的效益，何苦發此噪聲，給人詛咒呢？朋友對我說：蟬噪聲在炎炎夏日的施虐中，是現象的一種，不足介意，況且它的壽命多麼短促，夏盡秋來，便銷聲匿跡了。</p>
<h3>數</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>數，不過是表示着質，量，或其他各種東西的多少而已。例如一場官司，二記巴掌，三個臭皮匠，之類，本來是沒有甚麼好說的。不過數旣是表示質或量的多少的，那麼，為表示質或量的多少起見，自然不說則已，要說，便該說準確的數字。例如說，「那個女人，還只二十二三歲，」「那時候，是在六七月裏，」「昨天的雨，是四五點鐘下起的，」「那是一篇三四千字的文章。」這一類的連續着用二個數字在一起的話，委實的覺得有些兒費解。</p>
<p>從前，我在故鄉時，聽人家說起路程的遠近，幾乎是有一定得規律的。最普通的，是「三里，」「六里，」「九里，」「十二里，」「十八里，」「二十四里，」「三十六里，」「四十八里」，「六十里」等幾個距離。雖然在實際上，路程的長短，至不一致，但說起來，總是說一個最近似的里數。從未有人說過「從某地，到某地，是二十七里，」或「二十八里。」因此，我們時常可以聽人說，「從甲地到乙地的三十六里，比了乙地到丙地的三十六里，遠得多。」同是一個「三十六里，」却還可分出遠近來，真是秒不可言的說法。</p>
<p>近幾年來，數字的用途，一天廣似一天了，在原有的形容詞的用途之外，竟逐漸地轉變成了代名詞，或是名詞了。例如王公館的門牌，是十三號，於是「十三號，」便成了王公館的代名詞。女茶房楊愛弟的芳名，是不怎麼有人知道了，「七號」，却誰都知道是那位眼兒和眉兒，都會得說話的女招待。巡捕，信差，電車上的賣票的，等等，似乎都是埋名隱姓的。某號，便是某人的真姓大名，真是好要子。再如機關裏的甚麼科，甚麼課，如今也都把數字替代着了，說起來，總是第一科，第二科，真是簡單之至。而工廠裏邊，更有「南無溫」，「南無拖」的榮銜，（讀着「那麼溫，」「那麼拖，」意謂第一號，卽工頭與副工頭之謂也，）代表着他們的真名真姓。不過在上海，有若干數字却不作數字用的。如「勿三勿四，」「七勿搭八，」「勿管三七念一，」「攪七念三，」「嘴五舌六，」「板板六十四，」「六亂三千，」「亂話三千，」「二八五」等等，雖然天下第一流的數學家，也無由說出這些數字的道理來。但是，這些數字，在上海人嘴裏，却沒一家不熟極而流。奇數也。</p>
<h3>北火車站的畫面</h3>
<p>— 張慕良</p>
<p>北火車站似乎守着紀律似的終年在開映着一個煩囂而雜亂的畫面。這畫面對於我們的印象中，那是絕不會洗滌了的。</p>
<p>「噹！噹！……」一陣子巨大的鐘聲敲了之後，那二十世紀的怪物，已伏在軌道上吼的聲嘶力竭的開到了。長的，矮的，瘦的，肥的…各種不同姿態的人羣，一個個都從黑黝黝的車廂的肚子中攢出來在騷動着了。大小的貨物也是同樣的在騷動着了。鼎沸的人聲，緊張的情緒，一切都充溢着倥偬的動態。人羣的細胞，也似乎一個個戰慓在這煩囂而什亂的畫面中的。</p>
<p>本來，大門口祗有一個守門的路警站着的，這時情形顯然就不同了，武裝的警士由一個而增加至十來個了。</p>
<p>人，一個個，一串串，蠕蠕地在收票處擠出來了。警士也乘着這個時候在檢查人們笨重的行李。</p>
<p>「先生！南京飯店好哦？」「先生！東亞旅館很清爽的。幾個旅館的接客者，都爭先恐後的在兜着生意。</p>
<p>站在鐵柵外的黃包車夫，看了這個情形，好像莫大的希望已來臨了似的，於是就運用了他們的飛毛腿，奔到車站口搶着每個人的交易，可是，黃包車夫們交易的命運，終于給警士的木棍阻住了。</p>
<p>「噹！噹！……」巨大的鐘聲，又敲了一陣之後車站上的無線電也就嘹亮而清晰地在報告；「京滬一點二十分特別快要開了！」因之，靜了刹那的車站上，又恢復了紛亂的狀態。</p>
<p>北火車站似乎守着紀律似的終年在開映着一個煩囂而什亂的畫面。這畫面對于我們的印象中，那是絕不會洗滌了的。</p>
<h3>飲水思源</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>換巢鸞鳳</p>
<h3>張恨水著</h3>
<p>第四回　視聽都非浮沉疑復柬　死生可託慷慨寄哀吟</p>
<p>可是離學堂不遠，轉過一條小巷的時候，那位自己所不願見的姑娘，却是頂頭碰着。他今天初換了白色的上衣，繫着條長　　書湖縐裙子。在衣鈕扣上斜掛着一個茉莉球。手上倒提了一柄　稠小衆，却沒有撐用。看他的情形，那是十分自然。自己有心事的人，就聯續着會生出那麼一個感想，他竟是不曾生氣嗎？正這樣想着呢，他好像有了什麽新得的感想，突然的站住了腳將兩眼向人注視着。在國器自己，很不知道怎樣自處，才算適當，兩隻眼皮，只管向下垂去，不敢對人正視着，這時人家站住了，而且還向這邊看了來，自己是決對不能不理，情不自禁的，向人家微笑着。在這時，看到他是正着臉色，將以前所從未有的態度，也表示出來了，對了國器，竟是深深的點了一個頭。不過他在點頭之後，並沒再有別的表示，立刻昂起頭來，就這樣選直的走了。國器出得學堂門來，下了一個不理會他的決心，人是清醒得多了。現在又遇到了他，血且得着他這意外的待遇，那就不能不高興起來了。一高興起來，又不覺是重入了迷魂陣。於是把出家門的那種態度，依然又恢復着，把香包夾在脇下，將呢帽沿子連下來一點，乘了頭一步的向家裏走了去。直走進了大門口，這才二次醒悟着，不能再沉沉的胡思亂想了。站着定了一定神，還像對着鏡子一樣的，故意裝着一回笑容，然後散着胸脯子，走到堂屋裏去。其實經過那一度叮囑之後，章老太料着國器也不會再把打筆仗的事，放在心上的了。這時，他自在他臥室裏休息。國器見堂屋裏沒人，也不願再驚動母親，自悄悄的走回堂房裏去。自己也不解什麽緣故，覺着是特別的疲乏，倒在籐椅子上，連翻身也感覺到不願意了。這樣一躺約莫有兩一小時，也不會起身，這就到了吃晚飯的時候了。劉媽來請吃頓飯，本待不去，可是自己不上桌，又怕母親會因這個疑心自己生病，只好站起來，盤碟自己的衣服。而且還怕臉上帶有病容，又把濕手巾擦了兩把臉，方才走到堂屋裏來。一看桌上所擺的，是一碗豆腐湯，一碗煮小白菜，一碗豇豆炒肉絲，還有兩條小鯽魚。（五四）</p>
<p>人物小誌</p>
<h3>高爾基的一生（下）</h3>
<p>— 林儷琴</p>
<p>一八九八年三十歲，高氏最初的單行本小說集「瑪加爾·丘特拉」出版。同年五月，第二次被捕，被囚在外高加索的中央部某一堡壘中，罪名是組織犯罪的結合，在工人的團體中作社會民主的宜傳，對現行制度及政府政策之不滿意而圓推翻皇室的專制政權。但不久，卽無罪開釋。</p>
<p>一九〇〇年第三次被捕，被遣戍到亞兩薩摩斯地方，罪狀是津貼亂黨。後得托兩斯泰的援助，又經過七個醫生的檢騐，證明他的肺部不健全才得釋放。</p>
<p>一九〇二年高氏被選為皇家科學院名譽會員，但這種推蔗頗引起少數貴族階級的嫉視和反對，卽以高氏曾被控在工人中作革命宜傳，犯刑律一〇三五條而取消其資格。</p>
<p>一九〇三年三十五歲，「高爾基小說集」六卷出版。在這一年，高氏收買了一個出版機關，出版日報，發表許多鼓吹革命的社論，又刊行了許多價廉的大衆文學讀本。</p>
<p>一九〇五年，俄皇屠殺示威羣衆，高了因起草「企圖顛覆俄羅斯現存制度宣言」，又被拘捕，結果放逐出國。</p>
<p>一九〇六年春，高氏離俄赴美，因募集援助俄羅斯革命運動基金，在美開會演說，被迫轉赴意大利加菩利島小住。翌年赴英參加社會民主黨的倫敦大會。</p>
<p>一九〇八年高氏在意大利和菩利島組織社會民主黨支部，對黨供給了他的大部份版稅。在這時期，高氏開始和列寗通信。</p>
<p>一九一四年羅曼諸夫皇朝三百年紀念，高氏得遇大赦機會，重返俄羅斯。</p>
<p>一九一七年俄羅斯十月革命完成後，高氏傾注了最善的努力，活躍參加蘇維埃文化建設。</p>
<p>一九二一年，高氏肺結核舊疾復發，再赴意大利蘇倫多養病。翌年移居德國。</p>
<p>一九二八年三月十九日，為高氏六十誕辰，同年，也是高氏從事文學生活的三十五週紀念，這天，全蘇聯為他舉行盛行的祝典。這一月，高氏回國，被選為蘇聯中央執行委員。</p>
<p>一九三一年夏，高氏重以正式黨員的資格加入布爾塞維克黨。</p>
<p>一九三二年四月，蘇聯第一個五年計劃完成之年，第二個五年計劃開始的前夜，全蘇聯作家同盟委員會成立，高氏以普羅文學的保姆之資望，被推舉為名譽主席。</p>
<p>一九三六年高氏六十七歲，染流行性感冒，於六月十八日，病歿於莫斯科近郊某一鄉村中。</p>
<p>總覽高氏一生，其幼年生活之貧苦。及中年與環境奮鬥的精神，實足令人肅然起敬；而尤以終身未受一日有系統的教育，僅以自修成功而稱雄於世界文壇，千古能有幾人！</p>
<p>這裏，要講敘高氏的文學傾向了，關於這一方面的探討，那不消多說。一言以蔽之：高氏是一位頂前進的B字號作家。</p>
<p>但，高氏的早期作品，却傾向於浪漫的寫實主義，又因自身根本從下層而來，所以在他的小說裏的人物，差不多都是襤褸的一羣。而其核心的意向所表現的原質，便是因崇拜超人的心理而極意刻劃出那種有着堅強意志和熱烈感情的流氓型；從專一拿破壞法律和社會秩序的行動為滿足這方面以創造一種超善惡的哲學。這一類的作品如「折爾卡休」及「瑪爾伐」等等。直到一八九八年以後，他才轉變了這種作風。</p>
<p>高氏的著作，在這裏，大略可分為五個時期：</p>
<p>第一期是從一八九二到一八九八年，是他創作短篇小說的時期，也就是傾向於浪漫和寫實主義之初期時代。</p>
<p>第二期是從一八九九到一九〇六年，是他寫社會問題的長篇小說和戲曲的時期，這時期內的重要作品：有長篇小說「福瑪·戈爾地葉夫」，「三人」，及戲曲「小資產階級」，「夜店」等等。在這年代內，高氏因創辦日報，同時又寫了許多鼓吹革命的社論。</p>
<p>第三期是從一九〇七到一九〇九年，是他開始描寫階級鬥爭的小說時期，這時期內的主要作品：有戲曲「敵人們」，長篇小說「母親」等等。</p>
<p>第四期是從一九一〇到一九一二年，是他勇敢地致力於革命的怒潮中德文學時期，在這時期之內，他無情地批判了小資產階級之沒落；明顯地擁護着無產階級之孳生。主要的作品：有中篇小說「奧克洛夫城」長篇「莫脫威·郭塞米耶金」等等。</p>
<p>第五期就是一九一二年以後真到他的最後一呼吸為止，在這長時期內，除了完成他的鉅大的史詩，「四十年代」以外，可說是他寫自敘傳和回想錄的時期，關於自敘傳的作品：有「我的童年」及「我的大學」諸作。關於回憶一方面的文字：「安特列夫回想記」與「科洛漣珂回想記」——科洛漣珂是俄羅斯早期前進作家。高氏躍登文壇，很得力於他的協助——諸篇。此外還有戲曲「葉果爾·布里曹夫」等等。</p>
<p>講到高氏在文學上的成功的起原，這要歸功於他的根本否認形而上學，理論的主張：他認定「當大炮轟出了響的時候，詩神便沉默了」這句話是極其謬誤的。於是毅然拿他的謳歌着勇敢的瘋狂的詩歌：「鷹隼之歌」和「海燕之歌」，向文藝的園地裏投了二枚炸彈，要求着暴風雨更有力地襲來。這在俄羅斯十月革命之後是可證實了，而高氏在文學上的成功，當然自有他的很有價值的立論和觀點。</p>
<p>我們崇拜誠服的偉大的高爾基已離開這世界了。這是世界文壇的最大的不幸，也是永遠不可補償的損失！這句話我在開首就已說過。但是，死亡是人生不可避免的終局，「永生」這句話在人生哲學上和「上帝」一般地渺茫；我們祗有推想到「死者已經死了」這一觀點上，收藏起傷悼高氏得心緒，期望着新生的高爾基到這個世界來！</p>

<p>上海夜景</p>
<h3>人肉市塲</h3>
<p>— 李鏞</p>
<p>夜是多麽的神秘喲！尤其是上海的夜，充滿着誘人的色彩，仕女們給它陶醉得目迷五色。夜確屬是神秘的東西，所以一切神秘的勾當，也都在夜裏一一展開。但看煙，賭，娼這三件玩意兒，却都要趁這夜襄來活動一下。尤其是娼妓，差不多認定這是它整個的活動時問，所人被人們一致公認這交易人肉市塲的旅館，也就通宵達旦，景氣非常了。</p>
<p>有鐵一般的事實擺在我們的面前，假若我們要細細地領略這人肉市塲的夜景滋味，不妨在華燈初上的辰光，到各旅館去巡禮一下，就可以看到打扮得花枝招展的各色妓女，在每個堂口裏活動着。堂口裏的茶房，就是市塲交易的經紀人了。在經紀人的努力之下，至少每爿旅館裏有幾個在被交易成功。所以娼妓在上海的夜景裏，特別佔着主要的地位。雖然市政機關認為娼妓是最危險的東西，病相毒的機關，積極地在取締。可是娼妓具有不可思議的魔力，被它吸引的靑年依然似醉似在的去嘗試。所以淋病的傳染也就格外容易了。浪費了金錢，嘗遍了痛苦，那你的病，依然有增無减。試想，一個失足的靑年，旣被誤於娼妓，又被劣藥所中傷，在這兩重來攻之下，那所受的痛苦，不難想像而知了。施嶽泉就是其中受害的一個，他患的淋病是很厲害。差不多服過七八種的淋病藥，絲毫沒有効力，直至最近至永安公司購服了以黃色素和伐克淬凋合製成的「安敵淋」之後，才告逃出了虎口，讀者們你們要仔細喲！上海的夜景就是陷阱，同時市上的僞藥就是你們的枷鎖！</p>
<h3>臨診述例</h3>
<p>— 香港醫科大學醫學學士吳大超實錄</p>
<p>（一）急性淋病</p>
<p>患者為一商店之夥友，姓林，浙之雙林人，現年三十歲。（主訴）—微妓伴宿，患淋病將近兩週，尚在急性期內。痛苦萬狀，排尿時滴滴而下，極感覺强烈之刺痛，且灼熱異常。（病歷）——林君在上月某夜，在馬路散步乘凉，為妓所誘，致染淋病，卽來余處診治。（治療）——余常對症發藥，乃以黃色素與伐克辛製成之內服藥『安敵淋』服之蓋「安敵淋」對急性淋病之治療見効尤速，故林君之淋病祇服完三瓶即告痊愈，可謂幸運者矣。</p>
<p>（二）衰弱戒煙</p>
<p>患者為一女性，年五十六歲，其夫曾在民國十年間經營絲廠，其時出口絲價非常高貴，故積資甚富，因衰弱而誤吸烟以取振作，致深染煙癮，並有胃痛之病，戒除殊難。（主訴）——胃痛陣作，欲昏欲厥，煙癮難戒，失眠不安。（病歷）——中年時已罹胃痛，乃吸煙取緩，以致成癮，痛患依然，今春臺由曾在余處安全戒煙之徐君介紹來治（治療）——余囑向永安公司西藥部購服『胃痛靈』治共胃病，然後以培補戒煙聖劑『生殖素』除共煙癮，為速求其斷癮起見，再注射「育維賜保命」。如此三方兼顧，不到兩月，衰弱盡去，胃痛與煙癮，竟告安全除去云。</p>
<h3>健胃的根本方策</h3>
<p>— 王士英醫師</p>
<p>假若人們感到消化力衰弱，身體的各部也會同樣的感到不適，甚至於發生病態。所以吾人對於消化器的衛生，切不可太漠視不關。人好比是一部機器，食物就是機器的燃料，胃臟就是容納煤精的爐鍋。爐鍋一旦出了毛病，自然影響到機器的發動。那末胃臟有了病症，身體的康健也同樣發生問題了。因此之故，如有發生胃呆胃弱，食慾不振的情事，第一步趕快購服臟器製劑的「健胃素」，就可以增進消化力，帮助你血液的循環，自此之後，你不但身體强壯，同時面色也紅潤了，精力也充足了，這就是健胃的根本方策。若患有胃痛者，則當兼服「胃痛靈」，根除痛因，其效甚騐。眞有藥到病除之功也。</p>
<h3>痛苦的回憶</h3>
<p>— 病夫</p>
<p>「窮人勿生病，好比交大幸。」這兩句流行的俗語，已經將窮人生病的痛苦，很隱的地顯露了。</p>
<p>我因為窮，而又是色星高照，所以每次性慾衝動之後，祇好去借重兩手來抑制它，結果染了很劇烈的遺精病”並且這種自凟的惡癖，是帶些神秘性，甚至於無法擺脫。因此罹上很沉重的神經衰弱症，沒有精神去從事事業。不料我又窮，而屢次告貸去購得來的遺精藥，偏偏和我窮小子開玩笑，效騐全無，並且將我的病天天加重，試想窮人生病，已經是痛苦萬狀，怎經得去再加上劣藥的重利盤剝？所受的痛苦，也就加深了一重！我遍嘗劣藥的欺騙之後，金錢和精神損失得不貨，直得今年三月初旬，承朋友的介紹，方才至太和藥房購服了「希米脫氏固精片」纔將遺精治好，同時又服了滋補聖藥「生殖素」一切神經衰弱病，逐漸治好，現在已掙脫了病魔的糾纏，這種痛苦的經歷，是値得回憶啊！</p>

<h3>骨痛尿酸之療治</h3>
<p>— 賈治中聲師</p>
<p>骨節痠痛一症。病源雖有瘋濕內蘊與餘毒未淨之別。然患者腎臟虧弱，濾尿功能發生障碍，因而使血份不潔，尿酸過多則一，該項尿酸形成如碎玻璃屑之結晶，入骨則骨痛。入筋則筋痙。入肌則肌痠。入肢則肢麻。小則手足麻木不仁，如被桎梏，重則全身瘓癱不遂，形同殘廢。</p>
<p>故骨痛症以內服『强斯登氏骨痛片』為最效，良以本品兼顧病源，奏効確實，尤以最適合華人體質故也。余迭用以治癒方君之四肢麻木，邱君之骨痛筋痙，及佘劍民先生之遠年瘓癱，為期均未逾二月，相繼脫離病魔之侵蝕，如『强斯登氏骨痛片』者，其功効確能使病者信任及醫師推崇也，</p>
<p>半身不遂</p>
<p>余於數年前即患骨節酸痛之症，雖曾服藥調理，苦無相當有效之藥品，因此病仍纏綿，上年冬反增劇，甚至左邊肢骨不能行動，交節氣時發作尤烈，懇請指示治療之法（陳硯農）</p>

<p>（一）未老先衰治愈者的經過</p>
<p>（二）婦女病健宮調經之敎訓</p>
<p>（三）戒除煙癮成功者之實錄</p>
<p>（一）未老先衰者。謂年未達衰老之耳。而容貌身體已呈衰老狀態之謂也。</p>
<p>本症患者。或因秉賦薄弱。或緣手淫斵傷。或基操勞過度。或由病後失調。共生殖腺內分泌頓感缺乏。全身失其調節營養之功。致血枯神衰。精薄肌瘦。以致腰痠背駝。面色蒼瘁。年事見高。非投出生殖腺素製劑不可。</p>
<p>患者孫君。年三十二歲。因營養不佳。調攝欠宜。致身體衰頽。精神萎靡。形成早衰早老狀態。不惟體顫肢冷。腰痠背痛。且怕勞畏煩。失眠健忘。望之年似不惑。今春來余處求治。經余囑向中法藥房購服「生殖素」。其生殖腺頓復繁榮。身壯體健。血旺神足。回復二十六七歲時代之靑春狀態。欣欣稱謝而去云。</p>
<p>（二）婦女病症。以月經不調及帶下為最普遍。次之則乳萎腹痛及小產者為最多。其病源咸由生殖腺病弱而起。故對症治法。自以培補其生殖腺為最上。</p>
<p>患者白正明夫人。來訴有經痛不調。或先或後。或多或少。經來宮冷作痛。遷延失治。更苦赤白帶下。纏綿多年。乳萎體弱。經余囑向中英藥房購服「女用生殖素」以健宮調經。並外用「療帶靈」。以去炎療帶。前後為期未逾一月。即告痊愈。回復其少婦應有之靑春美。且胸部發育。逈非來初診時萎頹所可比云。</p>
<p>（三）煙癮之成。由胃痛吸烟取緩者。數逾過半。如不先根治其胃痛。則痛患牽格。戒煙難竣全功。</p>
<p>經余所戒除煙癮者多矣。其有因胃痛而吸煙成癮者。余每先根治其胃痛。於是戒煙時安全愉快。煙癮即迅速斷除。</p>
<p>去冬有許夢梅君來求戒煙。據訴罹胃痛不下十年。經余囑向永安公司購服「胃痛靈」治共病根。而以「健胃素」健共病胃。胃痛既告根治。即投用「生殖素」除共煙毒。斷共煙癮。為期未屆匝月。即告安全戒煙云。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>西班牙亂事</h3>
<p>— 翔</p>
<p>西班牙女子，以艷名著世界，那知道他們民衆，是在水深火熱之中，革命浪潮，近數年來，十分的猛烈。西班牙原為一個王國，一九三一年革命，王帝給推倒了，成立共和國，但他們地主勢力，十分雄厚，故代表着地主們利益的王位雖被推翻，地主勢力，仍然存在，這幾年來，和革命勢力，立在兩個尖銳鬥爭的營壘，此次變亂，仍然是舊勢力的作祟。據二十四日國民社巴黎電訊云：西班牙廢王阿方朔今日向巴黎晚報記者聲稱，彼不欲遽行回國，並謂左翼政府如仍戀職，則此次革命（！）决不終止，深願西班牙早日脫離恐怖與殘殺（？）惟有左翼政府失敗，始能結束內戰，並使西班牙獲得和平（！）此次革命純係一種民族運動（！）亦卽保皇黨與右翼共和黨合力推翻左翼政府之積極行動云。廢皇這一席談把這次西國變亂事件內容，說得再淸楚也沒有了。</p>
<p>此外，又據同日哈瓦斯社瑪德里電，政府頃發出無綫電廣播消息，謂叛軍所用金錢，係金融家瑪歇所接濟，按瑪歇係西班牙著名銀行家，復辟派領袖散茹爾佳將軍，前於一九三二年起事時，渠曾秘密接濟經費，致被判處監禁，旋設法逃出，避居國外。從各方面，我們可以看出：地主，銀行家，地主代表廢皇，以及帝國主義者，事實上怎樣結成了一條他們的聯合戰棧，各盡其力，對西班牙近世紀所掀起的革命大浪，加以嚴重的壓迫。這例子在過去，在現在的歷史上，實在表現得太多而太淋漓盡致了，今日由我們看來，眞覺特別親切而有味！我們身受的種種創傷，在西國革命與反革命激烈鬬爭情形之下，實是値得撫摩一下，領受些新的敎訓的。</p>
<p>在南歐洲的一角，本世紀以來，正燃起了煇煌的由舊社會走向新社會的烽火；在遠束大陸，中國也正表演着為帝國主義者所踐踏而發生不安的狀態，不要忽視我們今日的地位與力量，在世界急劇轉變歷史之中，我們正祖負着最重大的責任與任務。</p>
<h3>一個善良的女人</h3>
<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>是黃昏時候，天下着小雨。我獨個兒搾着傘，茫然地走着。剛轉過一條小衖堂，那一座熟悉的房子便呈現在我的眼前了。</p>
<p>看見了這屋子，不知怎的，我的心就猛然地緊了起來。輕輕地邁着步子，好像害怕驚動了什麽人一般，我的心利害地跳着。我小心地觀察前後每一個行人，他們都瑟縮地走着，這才使我稍為放心，於是我用震顫着的手掌拍門。</p>
<p>我害怕出來的是一個陌生的人，那時侯我將怎樣回答？而且假如她已有客人呢？這一列疑問在我的腦海里翻滾着。然而我不想走開。我重新敲着門。</p>
<p>有人在里面應聲了！我的天，最好是她自己，然而隔了一重門就像隔一重山那樣地遙遠，我聽不淸里面那聲音是不是她。我幾乎想　脚溜開，就在這時候門呀然地開了。是她，不錯的，正是她。於是我連正視她一面都不敢，像一個剛患過重病的人一樣，無力地提起右脚跨過了門限。</p>
<p>「我剛想出去呢！」我的心神漸漸鎭定了。我抬起頭望着，她正在等着我的回話，那雙眼睛像着了火一般。把我渾身都燒熟起來。</p>
<p>「你想不到我會來吧！」我說聲音戰抖着。</p>
<p>她點了點頭，又給我倒了一杯茶。於是我們面對面坐着。</p>
<p>看見了她，我又沉在回憶的海洋里了。我記得也是一個雨夜，那時候夜已深了，我獨自走着，沿着那條神秘之街跑回家里。突然，一個像幽靈一樣的人走過來，用底聲問我說：</p>
<p>「到我家里白相白相吧！」</p>
<p>我驚異地望着她，在微弱的燈光下，我看見兩串眼淚，在蒼白的面頰上閃耀着。我呆住了。就在這時候，她走近來，拉着我的手。</p>
<p>「可憐我吧，我：我…」她好像永遠不能再說下去一般。於是我連回話也沒有，伴着她走着，走進現在坐着的這間屋子來。</p>
<p>我看見一個肉體被人染汚了，可是却有着善良的靈魂的女人。這女人就是她，她給我帶來了一件神秘的東西，她像一個謎，一個永不會打開來的結。於是我今晚又懷着一種胃險的心情再上這兒來了。</p>
<p>她是那樣不高興說話呵！卽使是—句，也好像要經過長時間的思索似的。坐在我前面的是獅身女首的司勞克司，我這樣覺得。</p>
<p>「你的病好了一點麽？一我記起她上次告訴我的，就這樣問她。</p>
<p>她搖了搖頭，我看見她微微地喘着，手兒按着那喘動着的前胸，然而嗽不出來。「每個晚上都要到一二點鐘才睡覺，又不好睡…唉，還有好的希望麽，」有如一個抱着死去了的孩子的母親嘴里唱着的催眠歌，那顫聲哀哀地響着。</p>
<p>我跑過去，用手搭往她的肩膀。我戚到一個難堪的誘惑，然卽這是純眞的。可是她猛然地把我的手摔了下來，轉過頭來說：</p>
<p>「你為什麼又來呢？早知道你是這樣的人，我後悔那天晚上錯待了你……這地方不是你來的呵，弟弟…。」</p>
<p>似乎只有痛哭才能够發洩心中的苦痛一般，一連串眼淚撲簌地流下來。燈光下，充滿着筷水的眼眶，像黃昏斜照下的湖水那樣凄淸地閃爍着。</p>
<p>我緊緊地摟往她，全然昏去了。</p>
<p>「假如我有一個親人，…只要一個，那麼，我就…」她嗚咽着說。「但我每天遇到的盡是些野獸，是猪，是狗，他們那麼虐待我……」她抬起頭來，用禱告一樣的神情問着我：「人說世上沒有走不過的山，這是眞的麽？我什麽時候才能過這重山呢；我現在還沒有苦够麼？我實在疲倦了，然而我還是要拖磨下去，要到我死了才算走完了嗎？你說！你說！她用力地搖着我的肩膀，「你怎麽不說呢？你！</p>
<p>我看見她心里正燒着熊熊的希望的火熖。然而一切的生活却不住地用水來澆滅它，生活在她還不是厭惡同疲倦的麽？</p>
<p>夜漸漸深了，四而正得意地揚起了牌聲，吵聲和淫蕩的笑聲，我渾身像針刺一樣難過，我們全在沙漠上，感到了難以言說的寂寞。</p>
<p>我們只有坐着，坐着，怯懦地而又虔誠地等待着黎明。</p>
<h3>駱駝相</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>為了想使開支節儉，自己移居在大雜院里。起初，是不大慣的，漸次，也習慣成自然了。</p>
<p>下午，太陽被西面的山牆塘住了，弄堂里有點蔭凉，「多好的時機呵！」信念在各人的心上—跳，什麽後樓嫂嫂，前樓阿姨，諸色人等，一股腦兒趕出了牢籠，服裝，也相當的雄壯。坐，立，談，笑，都任性的聽之自然，不受什麽拘束。</p>
<p>口子上，走進來兩個女人，年紀的摸着都在四十開外了，脚。纏過的，走起來有點歪斜，黑色的大皮包，看上去也有相當的重量—</p>
<p>要看相，樣樣相，她把眼睛往諸色入等的身上一掃，—還有駱駝相。</p>
<p>許多的眼睛，釘在她的臉上，身上，和脚上，隔壁的大姐凑趣的來上一句</p>
<p>—相一次，幾鈿？</p>
<p>—細談大洋一角，普通相一百五十鈿。</p>
<p>—一百五十鈿不算多，就相上一回，再作道理。（未完）</p>
<h3>荷</h3>
<p>— 廖楚咻</p>
<p>荷的印度譯音我已經忘記了，從前是一度知道過的，這花在印度大概很多，幷且也很為重視。釋迦牟尼就坐着蓮台，禪門中人幷且以蓮台層數的多少來分階級的高下，其外有名的經典「妙法述花經」就是說明人類本來是生於巧泥中的，但他可以開起淸凈的花來。</p>
<p>至於我的歡喜蓮，上一篇文章中已經說到：第一就是因為他的瓣可以　了</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>麵粉油炸了吃，後來稍為讀一點雜書，知道把茶葉用薄綢包了，放在乍開的荷花中過夜，第二天拿起來冲喝，別有淸香，偶然一試，果然很好，但常常喝也不過如此。</p>
<p>在中國舊詩詞中寫到荷的實在太多，而西洋文學中却大都寫睡蓮，睡蓮較之荷稍少，白色的居多，現在靠通商的福，在中國也可以看到了。</p>
<p>荷最好自然種在池裏，種在缸裏的已經不大容易肥大，而國人竟有種在小盆裏的，葉如手掌，花如酒杯，名曰盆蓮。據說這種盆蓮，還是普通的蓮子種成的，不過用了一個特別方法罷了。</p>
<p>印度有一種巨薄，差不多有中國的蓮花四五倍大，幾個月的小孩子可以坐在開着的花中問，這大概不是一種傳說罷！</p>
<p>南朝「子夜」「吳歌」等在中國文學上是一道異彩，這些小詩咏蓮是非常好的，但是那些熱情的男女們幷不是對於蓮花的特別愛好，而是因為蓮字和愛憐的「憐」同音，取他的雙關的意思。子夜吳歌都是民歌，這情形在後來的民歌中同樣的可以看到，有名的「藕花落盡見蓮心，」現在讀了尚不能不十分感動，至於「劈開蓮子苦心多，」是更加悽艷了！</p>
<p>夏天了，現在正是荷花盛開的時候，我不知道在上海什麽地方有很多的荷花開着不？「留得殘荷聽雨聲」，大槪我只有在秋雨連綿時再去什麽地方聽殘荷上的雨聲了。</p>
<p>更正　昨刋「上海養蛙塲參觀記」一文，內容頗多悮植，如每蛙能產卵萬粒，此萬粒卵中至少能孵化新蛙八九千隻，被遺漏一「千」字，毫厘之差，失之千里矣。經作者來函指正，合亟更正，並致歉意。</p>

<h3>「王先生奇俠傳」零訊</h3>
<p>「王先生」湯傑說：「王先生奇俠傳」的確比以前的幾部「王先生」來得有意思，同時笑料也很多，而且每一個笑料都不是胡鬧！</p>
<p>「小陳」曹雪松前兩天在百代公司聽冼星海指導收蔽「王先生奇俠傳」掙曲「散夫曲」唱片，大為感動，他說：聽了冼先生的曲兒，就好像自己就在碼頭上，親眼聽見那般做牛做馬的碼頭工人在那哼哟，哼哟：地撤運黛物一樣，我感動了，我大大的感動了，我從來沒有聽見過這般偉大的曲兒！</p>
<p>導演左明不但對於主演的人負責地指導他們做戲，就是連臨時演員不好，不會做戲，一定要影響到整個的影片的。</p>
<p>「小阿媛」李琳在「王先生奇俠傳」中的戲，比較的少一些，但是她很努力，所以成績並不壞！</p>

<h3>海外車賽新訉</h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>最近各地舉行之汽車比賽。其較著者如意大利之大獎賽。及美國南北戰士紀念日之車賽等。均為汽車界所注意之事。爰為彙誌如次。</p>

<h3>為買衆製造汽車</h3>
<p>— 頌</p>
<p>今後汽車不致有急進改革　美車五月份銷數均見增進</p>
<p>關於今後汽車式樣的問題。美國汽車製造家毫無疑義地一致傾向於流綫化型。不過流綫化究竟要到如何稈度。一時却也沒有人說得上來。講到引擎的地位一層。那末大家都以為移後的趨勢已成為不可埋沒的事實。所以今後的汽車。在外觀上將格外的流錢化。引擎則將移置於後部。這種傾向差不多是汽車界入所一致默認的。不過這話可得說回來。如果我們細細地在美國汽車出產中心地的底屈羅考察一下。就可以曉得今後最近二三年中汽車的革新。决不為過份的尖銳化。及過份的急進的。其理由是急進的變化。在車公司方面所負的責任過大。誰都不願意冒這種危險哩。</p>
<p>美國寳塔克汽車公司總理克林勒氏。最近便表示着上面的一段意思。他又接着說。各車公司對今後新車的計劃。所有式樣引擎等等。都要依照着大衆的習尚而轉移。所以將來的汽車都是些駕駛和乘車人所「要」的。不是僅僅乎車公司方面所要的。因之一九三七年式的汽車。在大汽車廠方面。决不會有異常的急進改革。克氏又做一個譬喩說。如果寳塔克造一輛後引擎的一九三七年式新汽車。自然大家便湧到經售人的陳列室中去參觀。可是結果沒有許多人要買它。因為許多人要等待着別人使用後的結果如何。纔肯放膽購買呢。</p>
<p>又據克林勒氏的意思。汽車公司方面要曉得他們每年汽車的改革是否過於急進。關於這點。他們最着重於大衆的意向如何。他們所擔心的。就恐怕改革的過於新奇。離開大衆過遠呢。關於汽車市塲的「浸透」問題。引起了克氏的熱切。他道那些問汽車市塲是否浸透而飽脹的。其愚和間手挽車的是否塞足般一樣。因為沒有人知道究經那一個答案是正確的。樂士安極立斯現有的汽車數量。已經超過八〇〇，〇〇〇輛。平均每三人有汽車兩輛。照這個比率講起來。美國目下應有汽車八三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇輛。以代最寬大的估計二六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇輛。可是雙有誰敢說决不能達到八三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇輛的呢。克林勒氏接着又說。當然。在那個數目沒有到達之前。道路工程學和道路建築。一定要經過完全的變更。他的意思是。現在所需要的。不是以少數金錢獲得多量道路。而是以較大的支出得到更好的道路。</p>
<p>近來美國各地的汽車銷售數量日見增進。足見大衆購買力的更新為不虛。五月份的客車銷數比了四月份祗一些些。五月份中雪佛蘭經售商售出客車和貨車共計一二九，八一六輛。完成了三個月來最佳紀錄。從今年一月份到五月份。雪佛蘭的銷數為五三五，六三四輛。寳塔克五月份銷出汽車二一，二七八輛。成為超衆　期的紀錄。哇爾特斯麻別爾的銷數。五月份為二四，〇五七輛。</p>
<p>別克之今年五月份銷數為自一九二八年以來之最佳者。計共一七，六八九輛。赫特森之五月份銷與四月份若根據其經售商之報告。共售出六〇，七六四輛。其時期為自一月至五月出。透拉平車之銷數亦包括在內。司蒂倍克五月份之銷數為八，七〇五輛。與一九二九年五月份銷出客車及貨車一〇，七七三輛。為數已不相上下。在已往之五個月中。其總銷數為四〇，〇〇八輛。一九二九年同時期之銷數為五〇，五三三輛。派卡五月份之銷數超出以前紀錄。計逾七，二〇〇輛。今年之總銷數已超過二七，〇〇〇輛。在夏季裏車銷的程度將漸為低减。這是每年如此的。農區的營業在夏季却通常的要轉好。目下各車廠每星期的產量的為一〇〇，〇〇〇輛。今後將漸形减低。現在流行型的汽車。到八月一日就要裝記完成，不過有些公司要工作到八月中旬纔停止。</p>
<p>汽車上裝置無綫電的風氣。一天盛似一天。據最近估計。美國汽車上裝置收音機的。其數已逾三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇輛。新車裝置無綫電的。其比率更見增進。單以雪佛蘭一家而講。新車裝有收音機的。其成數已自百分之十五增進到百分之二二·五。雪佛蘭公司當局以為車中裝有無綫電的。實為駕駛人在乘車中所得的一種愉快。因之他們决計設一服務部。由總理一人專司共事。其下更設九區的服務經理。帮助各地銷售商推行無綫電的服務便利。</p>
<h3>寳塔克銷數激增</h3>
<p>頃據確息。美國方面之寳塔克汽車零售輛數。實以五月份為最多。蓋佔該公司有史以來任何五月份中之第三位。至以一九二九年至今言之。則任何月份。從未有如許銷數者。本年五月份之寳塔克汽車。零售總數為二一二七八輛。若去年四月份。則為一九四八一輛。五月份一六二〇九輛。均不逮遠甚。本年五月份之最後十天內。寳塔克共銷八二九四輛。此與一年前之一整月銷數相較。蓋達百分之五十以五。按寳塔克汽車。自問世至今。僅一九二八及一九二九兩年之五月份銷數。較今年五月為多耳。截至六月一日為止。一九三六年式之寳塔克耳之已交付者。計共一〇四九九七輛之多。若一年以前之一九三五年式。則為六六九八五輛云。</p>

<h3>Li Bai: There is Talk of Forming a Military Government</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Military personnel from a certain country have recently gathered over a thousand people in Yongwu. Li Bai is determined to resist to the end, and there is talk of forming a military government on August 1st. (Shen Shi News Agency telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Guangxi purchased 3,500 bags of military rice in Hong Kong, which were transported to Wuzhou and Sanshui customs in Guangdong via the Daming and other ships without being detained. (Central News Agency telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The National Salvation Comrades Association of various counties and cities in Guangdong sent a telegram to the Central Government on the 27th, requesting the central government to suppress Li Bai and save the people of Guangxi. The original telegram is as follows (salutations omitted): "Ever since the Guangxi warlords Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi started a war and undermined unification, our central government has been magnanimous, not dwelling on the past, and issued a clear order appointing Li as a Standing Committee member of the Military Affairs Commission and transferring Bai as Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government. Li and Bai should have reformed themselves and obeyed orders. However, according to reports, Li and Bai have expressed their rejection and have recently received assistance from a certain country to organize a puppet government to carry out resistance. This is a sign of extreme depravity, plunging the entire Guangxi into a state of utter ruin, making them not only criminals of Guangxi Province but also public enemies of the whole country. At this moment when the Guangdong situation has been settled and unification is not far away, we must not allow military bandits to harm the country and the people, leading to the emergence of a second Eastern Hebei. Alas, if Qingfu is not eliminated, the troubles in Lu will not end; if weeds are not removed, the harm will be endless. We earnestly request our central government to issue a clear order to suppress the rebels, pacify the rebellion, and save the people of Guangxi, so that the national law can be upheld and unification can be expected. This telegram expresses our urgent waiting for orders," etc. (Shen Shi News Agency telegram, 28th)</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) The officials of the new provincial government, mostly appointed by the central government, have now begun their work, so the administrative and financial organs of Guangdong Province are now fully active again. The new provincial government is now actively dealing with financial problems. The new Director of Finance, Ziliang, is busy checking the number of banknotes issued by Guangdong Province and the exact amount of silver held by the government. There seems to be no doubt that Guangzhou will adopt the national currency system, but before the system can be changed, there are still many things that need to be arranged. Chairman Lin Yun'gai is now making every effort to ban opium and gambling. From August onwards, the gambling houses will be closed throughout the province, and the ban on opium will be carried out gradually.

<h3>Ye Xiasheng Arrives in Hong Kong and Issues a Written Statement</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The newly appointed President of the Guangdong High Court, Ye Xiasheng, arrived in Hong Kong at 6:30 am on the 28th aboard the French ship General Joffre. Those who welcomed him at the port included Xie Yingbo and Zheng Guoping from the Guangdong legal community, and over fifty others. He was hosted at a luncheon at the Sihao Hotel. Ye is scheduled to take office in the province on the 29th. His written statement is as follows: "Now that the chaos in Guangdong Province has been resolved and unification is initially in sight, I have been appointed President of the Guangdong High Court, and I am responsible for seeking judicial unification, alleviating the suffering of the people, and, in addition to carefully handling the matters entrusted to me by the court and ministries, I personally believe that for the future of the judiciary, within the scope of my duties, I intend to transform the judicial organs from conservative to progressive, from passive to active, and from destructive to constructive, hoping to conform to the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and meet the needs of the people. For example, all the rigid and unscientific habits and malpractices of the court will be eliminated. Prisons should not only punish crime but also transform personality and change the environment. The duties of the court are not limited to adjudication but should also strive for various facilities. Therefore, what I plan to tell my comrades in China is to focus on forensic medicine, to emphasize education in prisons, and to emphasize construction in administration. As for the employment of personnel, in addition to being loyal to the party for thirty years, I have no factional or bureaucratic views. Anyone whose character and conduct can lead me to the above-mentioned path will be invited to cooperate with me and will be presented to the Ministry of Justice for appointment. As for how long I will be in office and whether the government will use me, I do not care about it at all. Even if I am only a magistrate for five days, I will not plan for five days. In short, I am used to being a beggar and lazy to be an official. I would be even happier to be able to unload my responsibilities early and return to my original state."

<h3>Economic Construction Movement Association and New Life Movement Association Promote Thrift Movement</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The General Association of the National Economic Construction Movement Committee has previously decided that developing agriculture, industry, and sideline industries, and promoting thrift movements, are the two major goals for the current period. Because the development of agriculture, industry, and sideline industries will start with investigation, the investigation department of the general association held a meeting at the Ministry of Industry a few days ago, attended by Wu Jingchao, director of the department, and An Han, secretary, and others, to discuss the matters to be investigated and the regulations of the department. As for the thrift movement, because it is the same as the central work of the New Life Movement Promotion Association for the autumn of this year, the two associations have decided to cooperate, and a joint meeting of the two associations was held on the morning of the 28th in the New Life Movement Association. The representatives of the New Life Movement Association included Ge Binhang and Yu Qi, and the representatives of the Economic Construction Movement Association included Hu Boyuan and Yan Shenyu. It was decided to organize a joint office for the thrift movement of the two associations, with each association sending a representative to jointly preside over the office. Hu Boyuan represented the Economic Construction Movement Association, and Ge Binhang represented the New Life Movement Association. It is reported that preparations will begin in the New Life Movement Association on August 1st, and the movement will be launched in early September. It is also stipulated that the working items of the thrift movement are the three major principles of cherishing time, saving resources, and loving things, such as promoting national goods, savings, cooperation, and insurance, and the Economic Construction Movement Association will formulate detailed implementation methods. The New Life Movement Association will formulate detailed implementation methods for cherishing time, saving resources, and social activities. It is also planned to follow the summer hygiene movement methods to promote the central work. The promotion areas are planned to focus on the capital, Hangzhou, and Guangzhou, and then extend to provinces, cities, counties, towns, and transportation lines throughout the country.

<h3>The International Significance of the Spanish Unrest</h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>The right-wing Fascist forces in Spain have been raising the banner of rebellion since the assassination of the Royalist leader Sotelo on the 12th in Spanish Morocco, North Africa. Later, they launched rebellions across the country, attempting to overthrow the left-leaning People's Government. For a time, their momentum was quite strong, and the capital, Madrid, was once threatened. Although armed conflicts are still developing in various places, the People's Government's policies have deeply won the hearts of the people, and most of the people have mobilized to help the government suppress the rebels. Therefore, the position of the government forces is now quite dominant. The failure of the right-wing Fascist coup is likely to be only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Let us set aside the final outcome of the Spanish unrest and discuss the international significance and impact of this event. The Spanish event has had a major international impact for two reasons. First, the outcome of the Spanish unrest has a major impact on the rise and fall of the two major forces of democracy and Fascism worldwide. Second, due to Spain's important position in the western Mediterranean, its internal political changes have a great impact on the power of the imperialists in the Mediterranean. Since the general election in mid-February, the political power in Spain has been entirely in the hands of the left wing. The victory of the Spanish People's Front not only dealt a major blow to the domestic right-wing Fascist forces, but also to the rise of Fascist forces worldwide. It also invisibly provided great encouragement to the activities of left-leaning forces in various countries. Therefore, in this unrest, all left-leaning forces around the world have expressed great sympathy for the Spanish People's Government's determined struggle and have requested their governments to assist the Madrid authorities so that the rebels can be quelled as soon as possible. The demands of various left-wing parties in France for the government to export military supplies, the British Labour Party's request for the government to intervene in the Spanish unrest, and the Belgian Socialist Party's telegram congratulating the Spanish People's Government's fighting spirit are all clear examples. As for the Fascist forces around the world, they have all provided spiritual and material assistance to the Spanish rebels. According to the British Manchester Guardian, "The weapons used by the Spanish rebels, especially the rebels in the Moroccan territories, mostly come from Italy." The French People's Daily also said that the commander-in-chief of the Spanish rebels, General Franco, purchased 24 aircraft from Italy. Although this news has been denied by the Italian government, it cannot be completely dismissed. Italy did this because it could profit from the establishment of a right-wing Fascist system in Spain and establish hegemony in the Mediterranean. The German government is also paying close attention to the Spanish unrest, because it has a significant relationship with the development of the National Socialist Party's power in Western Europe. According to the Manchester Guardian, Germany originally had many branches of the National Socialist Party in Spain. Recently, many Germans have gone to Spain under the pretext of inspecting foreign affairs and education, but in reality, they are engaging in political and military espionage. Germany already has a great influence in the Balearic Islands and Morocco in the western Mediterranean. If the rebels can succeed in this incident, then it can gain a foothold in these places, and its power in Western Europe will also greatly increase as a result.</p>
<p>As for the British Conservative government, it is very sympathetic to the Spanish rebels on the one hand, because if the People's Government wins, the people of Portugal under its influence will inevitably be tempted to rise up and overthrow the current government. But on the other hand, Britain does not want to see the People's Government completely fail, because if the Fascist forces win, Italy's power in the Mediterranean will inevitably increase, which is the most serious threat to Britain's Gibraltar naval base and its hegemony in the Mediterranean. As for the French People's Government, it is of course very sympathetic to the Spanish People's Government, but because of the opposition of the right wing in the country, it does not dare to interfere in Spain's internal affairs to avoid causing more serious international disputes. The French cabinet's order to ban the import of military supplies into Spain is a clear example.</p>
<p>In short, no matter what the future of the Spanish unrest is, the final outcome will inevitably have a very significant international impact. If we stand on the position of the people who are anti-imperialist and support democratic forces, then we should give great sympathy to the difficult struggle of the Spanish People's Government.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Customs Tightens Crackdown, Smuggling by Ronin Gradually Decreases</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Smuggling outlets are nearing their end. Ronin have suffered heavy losses due to large quantities of goods stored in a certain concession in Tianjin. The Ronin have approached Tianjin Customs to pay two-fifths of the customs duties to obtain tax receipts and be allowed to transship the goods to the south. The Customs authorities have refused, citing that there is no such precedent. Tianjin Customs has been cracking down severely in recent days, and smuggling has gradually decreased. The verification and issuance of transshipment tax receipts at the station are busier. Due to smuggling, the tax revenue of the Tianjin and Qin Huangdao Customs in North China in the first half of the year was only over 12 million, more than 9 million less than the same period last year.

<h3>Tensions Between Britain and Japan over China Issue Intensify; Britain Opposes Japan's Expansion of Spheres of Influence in China; Japan Requests Start of Negotiations for Mutual Understanding</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Tensions between Britain and Japan have intensified recently due to the China issue. The Japanese government is extremely concerned about eliminating this animosity. Yesterday, the Japanese government received an important report from Yoshida Shigeru, the ambassador to Britain. It is reported that the report stated that the British government, on the one hand, is maintaining its vested interests in China with an unyielding attitude and intends to use its influence to bring eastern Hebei and Peiping under the legitimate jurisdiction of the central government. On the other hand, it opposes Japan's policy of expanding its spheres of influence in China and demands that Japan reconsider various specific issues in Manchuria and North China. After considering this report, the Japanese government believes that it is imperative to start negotiations with Britain on the China issue and trade issues in various British territories. Then, based on mutual political understanding, an agreement can be reached. It is also reported that the Japanese government intends to explain to the British government that: 1. Japan has no ambition to invade Chinese territory. 2. Japan naturally respects Britain's vested interests without any doubt. As for Japan's so-called special position as a force for stability in the Far East, it still requests the understanding of the British government. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Dispute Arises Among Japanese Businesses over the Sale of the Tianjin Huaxin Cotton Mill</h3>

The Huaxin Cotton Mills in Qingdao and Weihui have both placed advertisements in Tianjin stating that they are not related to the Tianjin Huaxin Cotton Mill and have no intention of selling shares. This proves that only the Tianjin mill is for sale. Both the Kanegafuchi Spinning Company and the Toyo Cotton Spinning Company have offered 1.2 million, leading to disputes. The matter has been submitted to the Japanese Consulate General for instructions. Some shareholders of the mill intend to carry out a buyout, but are hesitant due to various concerns.

<h3>British Interests in North China Are Significant; Embassy in Peiping Will Not Be Abandoned, but the Office in Nanjing Will Be Expanded; Senior Embassy Officials Will Reside There for Extended Periods Each Year</h3>
<p>(London) During a meeting of the House of Commons today, Conservative Party member Lamb inquired of the government about the issue of moving the British Embassy in China to Nanjing. Foreign Secretary Eden provided a written response, stating: "In Nanjing, housing has already been secured that is sufficient for the ambassador and one secretary to reside in. The ambassador often spends extended periods of time in Nanjing each year. If the ambassador is not in China, the embassy counselor will be stationed in Nanjing as a substitute. However, I do not currently know when the embassy staff will be able to fully relocate to Nanjing, as this depends on the progress of the embassy's construction project. But as of now, a site has not yet been found. As it stands, Britain maintains significant interests in North China, and it is appropriate to maintain the embassy in Peiping and not abandon it."

<h3>Major Reshuffle of the Japanese Army; A Manifestation of Terauchi's Military Rectification Policy; Lieutenant General Sugiyama Appointed Inspector General of Education</h3>

Therefore, it has attracted attention both inside and outside the department. Minister of the Army Terauchi carefully drafted the reshuffle plan, submitted it to the Imperial Palace on the 24th, and received approval.

<h3>Travelogue of Japan (IX)</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Hu Zhongchi, Hu Yizang</p>
<p>(8) Osaka Castle</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I received a visit from Consul Ren at the hotel. He invited us to visit Osaka Castle.</p>
<p>Osaka Castle was built by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, an unparalleled national hero in Japanese history. He invaded Korea and defeated the Ming army. The ambition of the Japanese nation to expand to the continent may be said to have been inspired by his military achievements. Since 1585, when he conscripted tens of thousands of civilians to build this unprecedentedly strong stone castle, his prestige not only intimidated all the islanders, but even shocked the Chinese court at that time. The Shenzong Emperor of the Ming Dynasty, fearing that he would invade the border again, wanted to deal with him with a policy of appeasement. Therefore, he sent Zhengshi Yang Fangheng and Deputy Envoy Shen Weiyi to cross the sea to Japan. These two envoys presented a golden seal and delivered a letter of credence to Toyotomi Hideyoshi in Osaka Castle. The most important sentence in the letter of credence was: "Specially bestow upon you the title of King." Little did they know that Toyotomi Hideyoshi completely looked down on our great power. He was furious when he heard about the conferment and rebuked the Ming Dynasty emperor in front of the Chinese envoys. When the two envoys, Fang and Shen, returned in dismay, the Ming Dynasty emperor knew that he had lost face, but there was nothing he could do. This historical story is most boasted about by the Japanese, and it is specially emphasized in elementary school textbooks. However, from the perspective of us Chinese, isn't this the first chapter in the history of China's failed diplomacy with Japan?</p>
<p>In addition to such a historical significance, Osaka Castle also has a more important, geographical—and still can be said historical—significance. We must know that the Osaka of today, which is so prosperous, was originally a barren land in the 16th century. After Toyotomi Hideyoshi built this castle, Osaka laid the foundation for the city. Since then, this city has gradually developed and finally became the center of Japanese capitalism.</p>
<p>Today's Osaka is full of magnificent buildings that demonstrate the power of mechanical civilization, but the Osaka Castle, which was built entirely by human labor 350 years ago, cannot but make us marvel. This castle is entirely made of large stones. The several pieces embedded next to the city gate are particularly surprisingly large. At that time, we in the mechanical age really cannot understand how the people under Toyotomi Hideyoshi purely used physical strength to move so many heavy stones from the mountains from afar and pile them up so neatly and seamlessly.</p>
<p>(Note) There are four famous giant stones in Osaka Castle: (1) Tako Stone, 8 meters high and more than 11 meters wide, located on the east side of the inner city gate. (2) Furisode Stone, 4.5 meters high and more than 13 meters wide, located on the west side of the inner city gate. (3) Dragon Stone, located on the east side of the outer city gate. (4) Tiger Stone, located on the west side of the outer city gate. The Dragon and Tiger Stones are each 4.5 meters high and 6.5 meters wide.</p>
<p>Most of Osaka Castle, including the square outside the castle, has been designated as a park. Five years ago, the citizens of Osaka donated 1.5 million yen to establish this park as a memorial project for the enthronement of Emperor Showa. Therefore, not only are there pleasing green shade and lawns everywhere inside and outside the castle, but also a newly built Tenshukaku (castle tower) in the Momoyama style stands majestically inside the castle, adding more interest to the people who visit the castle.</p>
<p>This ancient castle, which is open to the public for sightseeing, has been the battlefield for several battles in history, but today it still seems to be a military location permeated with killing intent. As soon as we entered the castle, we saw two Western-style buildings on the left and right, with signs reading "Army Arsenal Branch Factory" and "Arsenal." Further in, we saw the headquarters of the Fourth Division. This tall, four-story, yellowish-brown Western-style building seemed to be looking down on the opposite, purely Japanese-style, noble Kishu Goten (Kishu residence). A Japanese-style garden is opened in front of the palace, with some rockeries and forest springs embellishing it. We walked straight along the garden path and up dozens of stone steps to reach the Tenshukaku.</p>
<p>The Tenshukaku is a majestic high-rise building with white walls, black tiles, and eaves of five stories and eight floors. A pair of fish-head-like ornaments, glittering with gold, are dazzling on the top of the building, called "Kin Shachi." It is said that this architectural style from hundreds of years ago was borrowed from a painting on an ancient screen depicting the battle of Osaka Castle. However, this is only the appearance. Once inside, one feels that it is a very strong modern building built entirely of steel and reinforced concrete. We bought tickets downstairs and went up by elevator. At the top floor, we leaned on the railing and looked out at the scenery on all sides for a while. Then we went down to visit the exhibits on each floor. These exhibits are all relics from Osaka's history, including clay figurines and ancient pottery from prehistoric times, various artifacts from the founding era, many portraits of local sages, various calligraphy and paintings by famous people of the past, and astronomical telescopes imported from the Netherlands in the early days. Many of Toyotomi Hideyoshi's relics are well preserved there. What attracted the most attention were his banner, ancient helmet, ancient sword, and his excellent calligraphy. These ancient objects from three or four hundred years ago should make the general visitors recall the achievements of the hero who conquered the continent. However, we did not have such memories. When we looked at the clothes, hats and cultural relics of the founding era, we only felt how great was the grace that Japan had received from Chinese culture.</p>

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Announces the Abolition of the Mediterranean Mutual Assistance Agreement Italian Government Guarantees No Retaliation Five-Nation Conference Resolves the Overall Situation</h3>
<p>(London) The House of Commons met this afternoon to examine the Foreign Office budget and discuss the government's foreign policy. The meeting place was full, and the galleries were also crowded. Foreign Secretary Eden rose to speak and announced that the mutual assistance arrangements established by the Mediterranean coastal countries in December last year had no reason to continue under the current situation, especially because of Italy's attitude. The Foreign Secretary began speaking at 4:05 pm and finished after one hour and twenty minutes. First, he briefly described the main international problems and expressed optimism about the current situation. He said that if the future five-nation conference were to be held, it would be very beneficial to the future of resolving European problems. He also said that the British government does not want to raise the issue of the transfer of League of Nations mandated territories for the time being, but is willing to study the issue of re-allocating raw materials. As for the problems in certain parts of Europe that Britain is more concerned about, it is indeed true, but it does not ignore the events that occur in other parts of Europe, because once war breaks out, it will inevitably involve the whole of Europe and cannot be limited by region. After Eden finished speaking, Sir Sinclair, the leader of the opposition Liberal Party, expressed satisfaction with what Eden said. Former Foreign Secretary Sir Chamberlain attacked German foreign policy, and finally Foreign Secretary Eden concluded the debate. The opposition Liberal Party proposed an amendment to reduce the external expenditure. The House rejected the amendment with 290 votes against 143 votes, and passed the original external bill with 313 votes against 138 votes. (Havas telegram on the 27th)</p>
<h3>British King and Prime Minister Cancel Summer Vacation</h3>
<p>(London) Since King Edward VIII canceled his plan to vacation in the French Riviera, British Prime Minister Baldwin also announced yesterday that he would abandon his plan to spend his holiday in Aix-les-Bains on Thursday and will remain in the country to work. The coincidence of the simultaneous changes of the British King and Prime Minister, coupled with the fact that British Foreign Secretary Eden solemnly stated in the House of Commons yesterday when debating the Foreign Office budget that the international situation is complicated, has caused much speculation in the Parliament about the current situation. It is generally believed here that Baldwin's change of plan is related to Eden's serious speech, especially his statement that he has not yet fully developed the government's preconceived notions is attracting more attention. It is also believed that no adventures will occur in any aspect in the next few months. Regarding the King's decision not to go to the Riviera, there is no official explanation. (Reuter telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(London) After the Parliament adjourns at the end of this week, it will reconvene on October 29th. At that time, an adjournment will be announced again. The next parliamentary session is scheduled to begin on November 3rd. During the parliamentary recess, all cabinet members will remain in England. Prime Minister Baldwin must convene a cabinet meeting in August to consider international issues. He has canceled his trip to Aix-les-Bains. After receiving the reply from the German and Italian governments accepting the invitation to participate in the Locarno Five-Power Conference, he must make careful preparations through diplomatic channels. Furthermore, when the League of Nations General Assembly meets in September, it will discuss the future of the League of Nations, which the government also attaches great importance to. (Reuter telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(London) When Foreign Secretary Eden delivered his foreign policy declaration in the House of Commons this afternoon, he announced the list of British delegates to the League of Nations General Assembly, which will be held in September this year: Lord Halifax, the Lord Privy Seal, Malcolm MacDonald, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, and Eden, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, as the principal delegates, and Morrison, a finance official, Shakespeare, a health official, Lord Cranborne, a foreign affairs official, and Malkin, a foreign affairs advisor, as assistant delegates.

<h3>Britain Expands Army Secretary of War Announces Conscription Plan</h3>

These infantry soldiers will serve for six years in the infantry and may serve for another four years at will. Nationals between the ages of seventeen and twenty-five who are unmarried are eligible to be conscripted. All recruits will receive 26 weeks of training in the first year, and then 14 days of training each year. All clothing will be provided free of charge by the government. During the training period, they will be paid according to the official infantry pay scale, and will also receive an annual gratuity of six pounds. (Reuter telegram on the 28th)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Discusses Foreign Policy Foreign Office Budget Passed</h3>
<p>(London) The House of Commons debated the Foreign Office budget yesterday. Foreign Secretary Eden explained the complexity of the international situation, saying that since Germany reoccupied the Rhineland, the British government has tried to start negotiations to stabilize the overall situation in Europe. With this spirit, the British government submitted a list of questions to the German government in March. These questions were neither harsh nor far-fetched, but expressed a sincere attempt to facilitate progress. If the British government had received a concrete reply earlier, it would have saved a lot of time. The Locarno three-nation conference held in London recently was also based on the same spirit. He dared to say that the results achieved at the London conference could show that the three countries had a completely constructive purpose. The reason for this result was largely due to the far-sighted political talent of the French and Belgian authorities and their generous cooperation. The communiqué issued at the end of the conference proved that we are now focusing on the future, not just on the past. The British government is willing to support the establishment of a new Locarno understanding to promote a general solution in Europe. France and Belgium share this feeling. He hopes that the letters to the German and Italian governments will receive a satisfactory reply. Before the five-nation conference is convened, a lot of preparatory work must be completed through diplomatic channels so that the conference can achieve beneficial results. Although there are still many obstacles to be removed, we have reached a point where there is a genuine spirit of cooperation among the countries concerned.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary then described the new Straits Convention established at the Montreal Conference, saying that the most important lesson of the conference was that revising treaties by negotiation and agreement in accordance with ordinary procedures and principles of international relations can establish a solution that is more favored by all parties concerned than unilaterally denying treaty obligations. The conference has indeed enabled the British government and the Turkish government to achieve a closer and more harmonious understanding. The Foreign Secretary then described the League of Nations reform, earnestly stating that the government's purpose is to expand and consolidate the foundation of international cooperation, but the detailed measures are still not convenient to be announced now, for fear of hindering the League of Nations conference to be held in September.</p>
<p>At this point, the issue of the transfer of mandated territories was raised, saying that this move involves the entrusted powers, and the British government has not yet consulted with other countries on this matter. However, from the British government's point of view, this issue will raise significant moral, political and legal difficulties, and a solution must be found. The Foreign Secretary concluded by saying that there are still many international problems that have not been resolved. The government hopes that no party will raise serious disputes among countries again. As for the issue of the average distribution of raw materials, if the League of Nations convenes a conference to discuss it, our government is willing to join the discussion. Eden then discussed the overall situation in Europe, saying, "It is true that our country has certain obligations to certain parts of Europe, but this does not mean that our country is indifferent to the events that occur in other parts of Europe and does not care at all. If a conflict occurs in Europe, can it limit the war to one corner without extending to the whole of Europe? Or is there another aspect of the problems we are encountering that must be mentioned, that is, none of the European countries are willing to fight for other countries today."</p>
<p>Eden finally mentioned the issue of armaments and criticized the attitude adopted by the opposition, saying, "The arms expansion plan that we have submitted to the House of Commons for approval will in fact not be used in any way that conflicts with the League of Nations Covenant and the Paris Pact, but only for the purpose of defending our country or assisting countries that have been invaded. From my observation, the time for arms limitation may come sooner than generally expected, because the economic burden of huge military spending on various countries is already unbearable and cannot be sustained for long."</p>
<p>Eden concluded by briefly elaborating on the major responsibilities of the world's democratic countries today. After he finished speaking, Sinclair, the leader of the opposition Liberal Party, took the floor and expressed satisfaction with what the Foreign Secretary said. Former Foreign Secretary Austin Chamberlain, a Conservative Party member, also rose to speak and strongly criticized German policy, saying, "Germany now intends to recover its pre-war colonies. It must be known that the German government, within its own country, still refuses to grant its own people civil rights, discriminating against and encountering them, even worse than slaves. If another nation is placed under the jurisdiction of this kind of government, I am unwilling to share the blame for the consequences. The policies pursued by Germany last year and its continued demands are all subject to criticism. Our country, under certain circumstances, may have to join the war. We may as well explain these circumstances, namely (1) the scope of our self-defense includes the defense of the entire British Empire, (2) the independence of the Netherlands and Belgium is closely related to the independence and security of France." Lloyd George, the former Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party, rose to defend Germany and criticized French policy, saying that France has greatly increased its armaments and built fortresses, which is why Germany has spared no effort to strengthen its military.</p>
<p>Finally, Eden rose to speak, bringing an end to today's debate, saying that the government has not prohibited the British port of Gibraltar from supplying oil to the Spanish fleet. When asked by a member of Parliament what attitude the government takes towards the amendment of the League of Nations Covenant, Eden replied, "We do not want to propose major reforms to the structure of the League of Nations. We are prepared to participate in anything that the member states of the League of Nations unanimously agree to adopt in accordance with the covenant signed by all countries." (Havas telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary described the unilateral declaration, expanding on the guarantees given to certain Mediterranean countries during the period of economic sanctions against Italy and the unstable period after the termination of sanctions, saying that he was pleased that there was now a special reason to declare that this unstable situation had come to an end. Around mid-month, the Italian government had spontaneously issued declarations to the governments of Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey, the contents of which were notified to the British government by the Italian Chargé d'affaires in Britain. This official document clearly stated that the Italian government had made extremely clear guarantees to the governments of these three countries, that the Italian government had never planned and is not currently planning to take any aggressive actions against the three countries to retaliate against their implementation of sanctions against Italy. The Italian representatives to these three countries also earnestly stated that the Italian government believes that the matter of sanctions has indeed completely ended and is convinced that all countries will enter a new era of mutual cooperation in the future, so he himself is very happy to acknowledge and announce that the British government believes that there is no need to continue the unilateral guarantees.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary expressed satisfaction with the new progress made in the British-Egyptian negotiations. He then briefly described the overall situation in Spain, saying that the country is still in fierce fighting after a sudden large-scale civil strife. How the future will be is unpredictable. The Foreign Secretary then elaborated on the plan to protect British nationals in dangerous areas of the country, saying that he had telegraphed the Spanish Foreign Minister and the Spanish government had replied accepting the plan, which he was comforted by.</p>
<p>Referring to the problem of Danzig, the Foreign Secretary highly praised Lester, the High Commissioner of the League of Nations stationed in the city. He then turned his words and stated the colonial problem, saying, "What is related to this problem is not only Britain, but also all other countries that have mandated territories entrusted by the League of Nations are also involved. As far as our government is concerned, the transfer of mandated territories will definitely raise serious difficulties in morality, politics and law, and the government has tried its best to find a solution, but it has not succeeded so far, which I can honestly say. There is more than one international problem that has yet to be resolved today. Fortunately, in recent days, these problems have been more hopeful of being resolved. At this time, if there is any problem that is enough to cause a serious international dispute, I hope that no party will raise it. As for the issue of equal distribution of raw materials, if the League of Nations convenes a conference to discuss it, our government is willing to join the discussion." Eden then discussed the overall situation in Europe, saying, "It is true that our country has certain obligations to certain parts of Europe, but this does not mean that our country is indifferent to the events that occur in other parts of Europe and does not care at all. If a conflict occurs in Europe, can it limit the war to one corner without extending to the whole of Europe? Or is there another aspect of the problems we are encountering that must be mentioned, that is, none of the European countries are willing to fight for other countries today."</p>
<p>Eden finally mentioned the issue of armaments and criticized the attitude adopted by the opposition, saying, "The arms expansion plan that we have submitted to the House of Commons for approval will in fact not be used in any way that conflicts with the League of Nations Covenant and the Paris Pact, but only for the purpose of defending our country or assisting countries that have been invaded.

<h3>Moroccan Rebel Army Crosses the Sea Again: Major Battle in Southern Spain, Government Forces Suffer Defeat, Situation Perilous, Nationals and Foreigners in the Capital Prepare to Evacuate</h3>
<p>Gibraltar: Moroccan rebel forces, advancing on Malaga in mainland Spain, defeated government troops this morning in the area of San Roque, killing 300 government soldiers. Many were wounded. Government troops retreated into the mountains at the time, but returned in the afternoon to counterattack, spraying the rebel army with machine guns. Fierce hand-to-hand combat ensued, with no clear victor by nightfall. The British destroyer HMS Basilisk arrived here yesterday. The ship was fired upon while rescuing 28 British and 12 other foreign nationals in Almería. Afterwards, government officers boarded the ship to apologize. Refugees all described the situation in Almería as appalling, with murder and arson rampant. A report from the Moroccan rebel side stated that officers and soldiers aboard the government warship Jaime I had requested to surrender to the rebels after being shelled by them the day before, seeking food, but their request was rejected by rebel leader General Franco.

<p>Gibraltar: It has been learned here that government forces have retreated to Malaga today, but the rebel advance in the south is not consolidated. (28th, Kuo Min News Agency)</p>
<p>Madrid: The government claims its forces have been victorious at Segovia and Toledo, 40 miles from the capital. However, fighting has broken out at Estepona, 25 miles north of Gibraltar, as well as near San Sebastián and Irún. The government forces' victory in the Segovia highlands will surely contain the rebel threat to Madrid. Government forces anticipate a major rebel offensive against San Sebastián. The battle for Estepona between government and rebel forces has been particularly fierce. Government forces set fire to pine forests in the area to impede the rebel advance. The rebels suffered 200 casualties but ultimately drove back the government troops. Fighting is still ongoing and appears likely to continue for some time. Whoever has stronger reserves will likely prevail. Observers who flew over both front lines claim rebel reinforcements are continuously arriving, while the government forces appear to be receiving less support. (28th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The fighting in Spain is currently taking place near Utiel, a key point on the main road to the northern Spanish resort of San Sebastián. The rebels aim to retake the area. Government forces have dug trenches in Utiel to resist the rebel advance. San Sebastián is also riddled with trenches and obstacles. Many women are joining their male family members on the front lines. According to official reports received in London, the situation in Barcelona has improved, but if rebel forces occupy Zaragoza, Barcelona may revert to a serious state. (28th, Reuters)</p>
<p>San Sebastián: Government forces attacked rebel barracks in Loyola today, capturing 400 soldiers, and then advanced on Navarre. (28th, Kuo Min News Agency)</p>
<p>Madrid: The diplomatic corps here, concerned about the precarious situation of their nationals due to the unrest in Spain, held a meeting at the Chilean Embassy. They resolved to establish a standing committee to assess the situation of foreign nationals and determine appropriate responses. The Spanish government has arranged a special "International Train" scheduled to depart from here on the 30th of this month, dedicated to transporting foreign nationals, especially British and American citizens, out of the country, and guarantees the safety of the train en route. However, three American citizens disregarded the dangers yesterday and traveled to Alicante; the government cannot be held responsible if something should happen to them. (28th, Havas)</p>
<p>Madrid: Despite repeated government claims of military victories, the U.S. Embassy here today received instructions from Washington to evacuate the 160+ American citizens from Spain if suitable transportation is available. The U.S. government is not responsible for their safety. Simultaneously, the Spanish government announced the recapture of Toledo and the Alcázar. The estimated number of casualties nationwide in this rebellion has now exceeded 19,000, with 3,000 deaths in Barcelona alone and 1,000 in the capital. The government has also issued an order declaring the warship Sevilla a pirate vessel, prohibiting it from flying the national flag and authorizing its seizure anywhere. The diplomatic corps met today and appointed a seven-member committee to arrange the departure of foreign nationals. The committee is chaired by the Chilean Ambassador, with two representatives from European, South American, and Far Eastern missions. The committee has requested the Spanish government to provide a special train and necessary protection measures. (27th, Kuo Min News Agency)</p>
<h3>Spanish Government Hastily Deploys Warships to Intercept, Government Forces Burn Pine Forests to Impede Rebel Advance</h3>
<p>Madrid: The Spanish government is currently preparing a major offensive against the main force of a rebel column entrenched in the highlands near Segovia, 40 miles from Madrid. Simultaneously, the Spanish fleet is steaming at full speed from Tangier to Estepona, 30 miles north of Gibraltar, to prevent another rebel column led by General Franco from advancing. General Franco is currently leading a large number of seaplanes and troops from Ceuta to Algeciras, attempting to dislodge government forces from Malaga. Each plane can carry 10-20 people. Pro-government forces in the Estepona area set fire to forests to prevent the Moroccan rebel army from advancing. Although rebels have been pushed back by government forces from Madrid, they have won minor victories in many cities. Hundreds of pro-government riflemen and armed workers were annihilated this afternoon by elite rebel forces at La Línea, just a few miles from Gibraltar. The rebels also suffered 60 deaths. This group had recently surrendered to the rebels but suddenly set out from Tarifa towards La Línea today, apparently aiming to attack the Moroccan troops there. The rebels hastily sent reinforcements from Algeciras by plane, and engaged the group in battle just a few miles from La Línea. After a long and bitter fight, the riflemen were completely wiped out. Heavy fighting broke out in Estepona early this morning, with reports of 600 soldiers killed and 1,200 wounded. Furthermore, an advance guard of 800 rebel soldiers encountered a militia and 100 armed workers at Guadacorte, killing most of them. In the battle of Estepona, an estimated 400 government soldiers were killed. Twenty communists imprisoned in the La Línea barracks were killed last night, and another twenty this morning. The British government and its embassy have been advised by the Spanish government to relocate from San Sebastián. British embassy officials have moved to the small town of Zarauz near San Sebastián. The U.S., Italian, Argentinian embassies, and Norwegian and Czechoslovakian legations have moved to Irún, while the French embassy has moved to Fuenterrabía. (27th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Northern Rebel Army Fails to Attack the Capital, Due to Inadequate Reinforcements, Retreat Appears Possible</h3>
<p>Rebel Headquarters near Segovia: According to the Associated Press correspondent embedded with the army, if reinforcements do not arrive quickly, the Northern Rebel Army Commander General Mola's repeated plans to attack Madrid may completely fail. The siege of the capital has been lifted. A general retreat appears necessary to consolidate rebel positions. Moreover, since Sunday's shelling, the majority of rebel forces in many areas have collapsed. It is also reported that the government has consolidated its positions in the Guadarrama Mountains and secured new positions south of Madrid. Food supplies have also been secured, and there is no longer a fear of starvation in the capital. However, despite the setbacks, the rebel army still believes it can capture the capital within a week. (27th, Kuo Min News Agency)</p>
<p>Southern Rebel Army Headquarters near Burgos: According to a special dispatch from an Associated Press correspondent, 100,000 rebel soldiers have arrived south of Burgos. After being inspected by rebel General Cabanellas, they immediately boarded vehicles to attack the Guadarrama mountain passes. This army is fully equipped and largely composed of residents from Navarre. Cabanellas declared that "Our army now holds the advantage. Aside from artillery, the Madrid garrison has no regular troops to support the militia. However, the artillery and ammunition are limited. Once General Franco's Moroccan forces arrive, the northern and southern armies will launch a simultaneous general assault on Madrid, at which time the outcome can be determined."

<h3>Airplanes Carrying Gold Bars to Purchase Arms</h3>
<p>(Paris) A Spanish three-engine airplane, piloted by Guatelli, landed at Le Bourget Airport outside Paris at 11:00 AM today. The plane was carrying 1,260 kilograms of gold bars, equivalent to slightly less than 45,000 ounces. It is reported that a Spanish airplane carrying £140,000 worth of gold arrived in France the day before, supposedly used by the Spanish government to purchase arms. (28th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Officials Resign from Foreign Posts</h3>
<p>(London) Counsellor Conte of the Spanish Embassy in the United Kingdom has resigned and is scheduled to travel to Brussels this afternoon.

<p>(Rome) The naval and military attaché of the Spanish Embassy in Italy announced today his support for the revolutionary army and recognition of the provisional government established by General Mola in Burgos. (27th, Kuo Min News Agency)</p>
<h3>Security Restored in Barcelona</h3>
<p>Madrid: After days of fighting, Barcelona has begun to return to stability. A total of 370 people have died violently in the unrest, including many priests and nuns. 270 of them died on Sunday of last week, 19 on Monday, and 81 in the following days. Around 1,000 people were injured. Instances of looting were relatively rare, and no banks were threatened. The city's political power and transportation are currently controlled by various labor unions, primarily the anarcho-syndicalist CNT (National Confederation of Labour). While the Catalan Autonomous Government can still direct the CNT, the question of how the two can cooperate remains. The CNT currently possesses a large number of arms. The Autonomous Government of Catalonia is backed by the Catalan Autonomist masses. It is generally believed that an agreement will be reached between the two sides to unite and cooperate. (28th, Havas)</p>
<p>Barcelona: It was learned today that three columns of government troops dispatched by the Catalan Autonomous Government have reached the vicinity of Cervera and occupied the cities of Cabestany and Bellpuig, routing four rebel columns along the way and inflicting heavy damage. Simultaneously, the fourth column of government troops flanked Cervera from Aragon and occupied the city of Salinella. Government forces now control two railway lines, greatly facilitating transportation. Barcelona is currently very quiet and has almost returned to normal. Militia Commander General Cabanellas has warned his troops not to seek revenge or engage in other transgressions. (27th, Kuo Min News Agency)</p>
<p>(Paris) International observers are still hesitant to draw definitive conclusions about the outcome of the Spanish unrest. Currently, both government and rebel forces are establishing positions and engaging in minor skirmishes as a prelude to a final showdown. Our correspondent in Lisbon reports that conditions along the Spanish-Portuguese border have returned to normal, and trains are running as usual. A dispatch from Washington D.C. states that the U.S. Ambassador to Spain, Bowers, has arrived in Port-Vendres, France, after leaving Spain. He has telegraphed the State Department to say he will board the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Cayuga today and inspect the conditions of U.S. consulates along the northern coast of Spain as far as Vigo. A dispatch from London states that the National Executive Committee of the British Labour Party has issued a declaration stating that the Spanish working class is sacrificing their lives to defend democratic institutions, and the British labor movement should help them. In the name of the Labour Party National Congress, a donation of £1,000 has been made. A dispatch from Berlin states that the German Ambassador to Spain, Stohrer, has telegraphed the Berlin Foreign Office, stating that since Madrid is still peaceful, he has requested the Italian Consul General in Barcelona to protect all German nationals there until a German warship arrives.

<h3>Fiscal Reorganization in Beiping, Increased Revenue from Various Taxes</h3>
<p>Nanjing Correspondence: Since Mayor Ma took office, Beiping's finances have been carefully reorganized, and tax revenues have steadily improved. The details of the various reorganization efforts are described below:</p>
<p>Business Tax</p>
<p>Regarding the business tax, the Beiping Municipal Finance Bureau has established the following methods for improving collection: (1) Prevent tax evasion and underreporting of taxable amounts by dispatching personnel to conduct door-to-door surveys in various districts. Those who have not reported taxes are instructed to report them in accordance with regulations. The Bureau is assisted by the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Bureau of Public Works, and the Health Department. Whenever merchants apply to these agencies for business registration, the agencies notify the Bureau to send personnel to investigate. This has been quite effective, reducing the number of tax-evading merchants and increasing tax revenue. (2) Instruct all merchants to renew their licenses annually in accordance with regulations. Personnel are dispatched to inform merchants to renew their tax registrations on time in accordance with regulations. (3) Abolish the cooperative collection associations. Previously, the Beiping business tax was entrusted to the cooperative collection associations of various industries for collection and remittance. However, many of them failed to comply with regulations. To eliminate long-standing malpractices, a gradual abolition method is adopted. Of the more than 60 cooperative collection associations originally established, more than 30 have been abolished, leaving only about 20. The Bureau directly collects taxes from the abolished industries. After vigorous reorganization, tax revenues have improved. The abolition of the remaining cooperative collection associations is continuing in order to achieve uniformity. (4) Construction businesses are taxed on a short-term basis. All construction businesses that were originally taxed on a long-term basis are now taxed on a short-term basis. Taxes are levied at any time based on the construction cost of the projects contracted by the businesses, as notified by the Bureau of Public Works. This has proven to be quite effective.</p>
<p>Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax</p>
<p>Since the transfer of the tobacco and alcohol license tax to the Beiping Municipal Government in 1934, personnel were dispatched in the summer of 1935 to conduct a thorough investigation and make corrections in accordance with regulations. In the spring of this year, all tobacco and alcohol taxpayers were instructed to truthfully report their business conditions quarterly thereafter for verification purposes and to prevent opportunistic behavior. After this reorganization, there has been a decrease in those operating in violation of regulations, and tax revenue has shown an improvement.</p>
<p>Brokerage Tax</p>
<p>Currently, in the handling of the brokerage tax, in addition to strictly investigating the business conditions of various households and correcting them in accordance with regulations, and stipulating that newly applying brokerage firms must obtain a guarantee, existing brokerage firms must also provide a guarantee. Thereafter, the guarantee must be renewed once each year when renewing the license to ensure prudence. This has also been very effective. According to statistics, tax revenues in Beiping have increased as a result of the active reorganization. The total tax revenue for 1935 (July 1935 to June 1936) was 2,516,632.60 yuan, an increase of 308,628.56 yuan compared to the 2,208,004.11 yuan in 1934. In addition, the municipal property revenue for 1935 was 261,906.12 yuan, an increase of 36,446.44 yuan compared to the 225,459.68 yuan in 1934. The Beiping Municipal Finance Bureau is continuing the reorganization while implementing (1) strict assessment and collection, (2) efforts to cultivate the public's habit of paying taxes, and (3) the strict implementation of rewards for reporting hidden and evaded taxes, to ensure that all public funds come from the people and that the government's legal tax revenue increases daily. Regarding future plans, the Beiping Municipal Finance Bureau has roughly formulated the following:</p>
<p>1. Improve the method of collecting house tax. Regarding the house tax collection area in Beiping, in addition to the six tax collectors assigned to collect house tax in the Xiaguan and Pukou areas, the city is divided into 55 districts, each with one tax collector who directly collects taxes with official receipts. However, there are often tax-dodging households who use various excuses to delay payment, resulting in a large accumulation of arrears. In order to improve the method of collecting house tax, the Bureau plans to entrust banks with the collection of house tax in Beiping to cultivate the people's habit of paying taxes themselves. The method is to first select the bank with the most established branches, sign a contract with it, and specify the terms. The Bureau will directly notify each taxpayer of the amount of house tax due each period, limiting them to pay the amount in full to the nearest bank within a specified period. If payment is not made within the specified period, the Bureau will impose a late payment penalty separately to deter delays.</p>
<p>2. Re-investigate house tax. Since the house tax was re-investigated in 1934, two years have passed. During this period, due to the opening of roads, construction changes, and property rights transfers, although personnel have been dispatched to conduct detailed investigations from time to time, it is inevitable that there will be hidden situations due to the vast area. The Bureau is afraid that the house tax will be affected if the delay is prolonged, so it plans to select capable personnel to conduct a thorough investigation this year to eliminate concealment and increase tax revenue.</p>
<p>3. Improve the method of audit. The Beiping Municipal Finance Bureau's assessment of house tax is mostly based on the reports of the collection personnel. There is no way to assess whether there are any omissions or omissions. The Bureau plans to have the audit personnel compare the police household registration book with the changes in the Bureau's taxpayer households on a monthly basis. If there are any discrepancies, they will be thoroughly investigated to avoid delays and omissions.</p>
<p>4. Reorganize business tax. The Bureau has formulated the following reorganization plan: (1) Plan to send personnel to inspect the account books of various merchants at any time and affix a seal to prevent false accounts. The annual business tax payable by merchants in Beiping is based on the capital amount recorded in their account books or the amount of annual business income. However, cunning merchants often prefabricate false accounts in order to take advantage of the situation. To prevent this, the Bureau plans to send personnel to inspect the account books of various households at any time and affix a seal for identification and to prevent forgery. (2) Plan to implement investigation and registration of changes in merchants. There are many changes in the reorganization, addition, removal, closure, or new replacement of merchants. The Bureau, in view of the fact that without clear registration, audit will be impossible if the changes are prolonged, plans to make an investigation and registration form for distribution to investigators in various districts. Whenever there is a change, they will register and report it at any time for verification. (3) Plan to request the police department to notify the Bureau whenever a merchant closes down in order to recover the arrears. The Bureau believes that many merchants who close down do not report in accordance with regulations, and it is often impossible to recover their outstanding taxes. The Bureau plans to make a notification form and ask the police department to instruct the various bureaus to fill out the notification when merchants report their closure, so as to recover the arrears and avoid loss. (4) Hold brokerage firms responsible for reporting business tax. Currently, Beiping only collects business tax from merchants operating stores. Due to the difficulty of investigation, temporary business of merchants in the city and outside, such as grain, trees, chickens, ducks, and pigs, has not yet been taxed. The Bureau plans to order each brokerage firm to be responsible for reporting the seller's business tax in order to increase tax revenue. (5) Open the collection of business tax for various industries that should be subject to tax. The Bureau will plan to open the collection of business tax for the entertainment industry, real estate companies, and other industries that should be subject to business tax in Beiping in the future.</p>
<p>5. Investigate the tobacco and alcohol license tax. In order to thoroughly reorganize the tax revenue, the Bureau plans to implement a general investigation in the shortest possible time in order to be thorough and increase tax revenue.</p>
<p>6. Reorganize the brokerage tax. Regarding the brokerage tax reorganization plan, the Bureau plans to order the various brokerage firms to submit two photos of the firm owner when renewing the license in the shortest possible time and affix them to the brokerage firm and the guarantee separately in order to prevent the abuse of acting as a substitute.</p>

<h3>Taicang: Armed Fight Occurs in Pailou Market</h3>
<p>Mu A-xiao and Zhu Jin-nu, boatmen of the third district, fifth township, third neighborhood of Pailou Market in the county, are half-brothers with the same mother. They are of poor character and have always been restless. Recently, while at home during the slack season, they stole a goose belonging to Qian Da-a-xiao from a neighboring village creek and cooked and ate it with their family. The Qian brothers are exceptionally fierce and did not dare to argue, becoming distant over time. Unexpectedly, the Lu brothers became enraged out of embarrassment and deliberately sought trouble. Suddenly, on the afternoon of the 26th, they gathered over seventy ruffians from Qianjing, Yiqiao, and other places and swarmed into Qian village, dragging Da-a-xiao out and brutally beating him. The villagers, feeling deeply indignant, started an armed fight. Many on both sides were injured. Qian Zhimmei and other residents of Qian village, fearing a major disaster, urgently telegraphed the responsible Fuqiao Township Public Security Bureau. Upon receiving the report, the bureau immediately dispatched Inspector Zhou to lead the entire squad of police to rush to the scene and suppress the situation. The main culprits, Lu A-xiao and Zhu Jin-nu, were captured on the spot. However, they were snatched away by the crowd during transportation. Qian Da-a-xiao was severely injured and on the verge of death. Villagers transported him into the city and sent him to Kunshan for medical treatment. The other injured individuals sought medical attention on their own. Fortunately, the Public Security Bureau maintained order effectively, preventing the conflict from spreading.</p>
<h3>Jinshan: Yang to Hold Memorial Service</h3>
<p>Yang Youjun, also known as Yang Zhong'an, the second son of Mr. Yang Daohong of Zhangyan, Jinshan, was a top student in the Accounting Department of the Shanghai Business College. He was proficient in English and Japanese, excelled in accounting, and was particularly skilled in music. Teachers and friends all highly regarded him. He wrote extensively, with his works appearing in newspapers and magazines. He had a published collection of children's letters, and two works, "China's Land Tax" and "Jiangsu and Zhejiang's Salt Tax," totaling hundreds of thousands of words, are indispensable reading for those studying the tax system. Unexpectedly, Yang Youjun suddenly contracted typhoid fever on June 8th and died in his Shanghai residence on July 2nd. Those who heard the news lamented his passing. The teachers and students of Shanghai Business College will soon hold a memorial service. A memorial service will also be held at the Yang residence in his hometown on August 5th.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Transfer of Prosecutors from the District Court</h3>
<p>Zhang Minsheng, a prosecutor at the Wuxian District Court, has recently been ordered by the Ministry of Judicial Administration to transfer to Shanghai Special District Court as a judge. His vacancy will be filled by Zhou Zhenzhi. After receiving the order, Zhang has been handling the closing affairs and is scheduled to go to Shanghai to assume his new post at the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Drilling Two Artesian Wells</h3>
<p>Suzhou's water supply has yet to be effectively managed. The Construction Bureau is now planning to first drill two large artesian wells, one in the city center and one outside Changmen, each 300 feet deep, with a planned water outlet diameter of 10 inches. After the two wells are drilled, they can provide drinking water for 100,000 people daily.</p>
<h3>Thugs Fight, Injuring Several</h3>
<p>On the 27th and 28th, continuous gang fights occurred here, resulting in six knife injuries, two of whom are in critical condition. The cause of this matter was very minor. It started when Wang Ronglin and Yang Gensheng, lacquerers from Yinguo Lane, teased women in the park. Yang was arrested and sentenced to six days in jail by the court. Yang's friend, Li Pinren, who worked with Wang Wenfan, a lacquerer at the entrance of Shangshu Lane in Hulong Street, collected eight small silver coins from his companions and asked Wang to deliver them to Yang in jail for his use. However, Wang embezzled the money. On the afternoon of the 27th, Li and others confronted Wang at the Chunyuan Teahouse in Xuanmiao Temple and slapped him. That night, Wang gathered a group of people, each carrying knives, axes, and iron rulers, to Hulong Street to retaliate against Li. In the darkness, they slashed Li in the waist with an axe, creating a wound about six inches long, breaking two ribs and deeply penetrating the lung. Li fell to the ground injured, and the assailants fled. Wang was arrested by the police. The injured person was sent to Guangmin Hospital and is in critical condition. On the morning of the 28th at 11 a.m., a carter named Lü Jinbiao and others mediated between the two parties at a teahouse near the Dayang Bridge outside Xumen. Unexpectedly, a disagreement arose, and they drew daggers and fought again. The police arrived and arrested fourteen people, taking them to the Third Precinct. The injured included Lü Jinbiao (a carter residing behind the Sanshan Guild Hall outside Xumen) with knife wounds on his chest and back, Wang Jincheng (a carter residing outside Xumen) with a knife wound on his right hand, Li Guangshun (a tofu shop worker) with a knife wound on his head, and Fan Jinan (a mud plasterer residing at No. 5 Daxian Lane, Yangyu Lane, inside the city) with knife wounds on his head and face. Lü Jinbiao lost too much blood and was severely injured, and was sent to Guangmin Hospital for treatment. The remaining ten are being interrogated and dealt with at the Public Security Precinct.</p>
<h3>Nanhui: General Overview of Road Administration and Vehicle Tax</h3>
<p>The enthusiasm of local figures in this district for road construction can be said to be the best in Pudong and superior to other places. In recent years, the completed stone roads include Zhanghu Road (18 li long), Beilong Road (4 li long), Beiyu Road (6 li long), Zhangheng Road (15 li long), District Central Road (12 li long, road base completed), Weiyang Road (8 li long), Dehua Road (5 li long), Panliu Road (3 li long), and Panlü Road (3 li long), totaling over 70 li, with a total expenditure of over 40,000 yuan. Of this 40,000 yuan, aside from a loan of over 5,000 yuan and over 3,000 yuan from collected vehicle tax, all were donated by local figures. The government has never provided special funding. However, the constructed stone roads require covering with mud once a year, patching with stone chips every three years, and complete renovation every ten years. Temporary damage also needs to be repaired immediately, otherwise, they will become rugged and uneven, causing inconvenience to travelers. If they are not repaired for ten years, all the effort will be wasted. Therefore, vehicle tax is collected to fund the district's road maintenance expenses. At that time, carters in the Tangqiao area, misunderstanding the situation, even started a movement to refuse the tax. After repeated consultations with the car owners and carter representatives, especially regarding the demand for timely repairs to the stone roads, the situation was finally resolved after ten days. On July 3rd of this year, an order was received from the county government that the tax should be uniformly collected by the local donation collection office of the county, and personnel were sent to the district on the 8th to take over. However, the order did not mention how the road maintenance and this vehicle tax would be managed. After explaining the actual situation and the entire process of collecting the vehicle tax, a petition was submitted to the county government to forward it to the two departments of finance and construction of Jiangsu Province, requesting a clear order designating that the district's vehicle tax be used exclusively for road construction and maintenance in this district, and that the collected vehicle tax be kept in a special account, to be allocated based on actual road maintenance expenses. However, the county government and provincial departments have never approved this request. It is feared that the result of this petition will be another empty promise. Therefore, a general report on the road administration and vehicle tax situation in this district is presented, seeking fair public opinion to urge the government to realize the situation. If the provincial departments still refuse to approve it, then in the future, those enthusiastic about local public welfare will become apathetic, and the people's faith in the government may be lost from this point on. It is hoped that the government can consider the local situation and not ignore the people's earnest expectations, and not bear to see the stone roads of over 70 li deteriorate and collapse due to lack of maintenance.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Six Notorious Robbers Arrested</h3>
<p>Zhang Rongxing, the leader of the Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team, received a confidential report the other day stating that Chen Yong'an, a notorious robber with a history of crimes, was hiding on a net boat in the Yangchang River near Outang Bridge. He requested that a team be dispatched to arrest him immediately. After receiving the report, Team Leader Zhang immediately led the police to the countryside to arrest him and successfully apprehended Chen Yong'an. He also arrested Li Mingfu, Ding A-er, and Chen Chunhua, who were involved in receiving stolen goods, as well as boat mates Chen Zifang and Wu Dianchen, totaling five individuals. They were all brought to the bureau, where Clerk Zhang interrogated them strictly. Chen Yong'an and others confessed that in December of the 23rd year, they formed a group of four and robbed a night boat in Yangpo Weiyu. On December 5th of the 24th year, they robbed Jiang Wanfu's fishing boat. In the spring of this year, they committed four thefts. Clerk Zhang verified their confessions and ordered them to be detained to await transfer to the court for trial.</p>
<h3>Six Killed in a Major Fire</h3>
<p>Deng Zengquan, a resident of Deng Gengshang near Zha Jia Bridge in the seventh district of the county, was over fifty years old and made a living farming. His house, a three-bay structure, was in an isolated village. There were seven family members, both male and female, and they were fairly well-off. One night, the other day, around midnight, Deng's house unexpectedly caught fire, and a terrible disaster occurred. Before long, the flames burst through the roof, and the fire was so bright that it illuminated the sky and was impossible to approach. Upon seeing this, the nearby residents immediately rang gongs to alert others. The Zha Jia Bridge Fire Brigade rushed to the scene with water dragons to put out the fire. However, due to the intensity of the fire, their efforts were ineffective. It took two hours to extinguish the fire. All three rooms of the house were reduced to ashes. During the fire, six members of the Deng family were unable to escape and perished in the flames. Only his son, Yonggen, who was out watching a local opera performance, escaped the tragedy. The charred bodies have now been dug out from the rubble, and their bodies are dismembered, a truly tragic sight.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Implementation of Shop Tax Collection</h3>
<p>The Wuyi County Government received an order to collect housing tax. After convening a meeting, it was decided to postpone the collection of residential housing tax. The Public Security Bureau was instructed to investigate and organize the shop tax. The Public Security Bureau then submitted the tax amount to the county for approval. After further review and confirmation, it was submitted to the province for approval and scheduled to be implemented at the end of this month. It is reported that after this reorganization, the actual monthly collection from the 78 townships in the county is 2,909 yuan and 6 jiao 9 fen. The Public Security Bureau has prepared a budget, deciding to use the increased 800 yuan per month to increase police salaries by 4,800 yuan, adding one yuan per month to each policeman's salary, purchasing firearms for 3,000 yuan, and distributing them to various branches to strengthen their forces. The remainder will be used for pilot police projects, and this has been submitted to the County Administration Council for decision and implementation.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Public Official Imprisoned for Framing</h3>
<p>Yan Xuecheng, a resident of Liu Zhou Township in the fourth district, and Wu Bao-xin, the owner of Hengsheng Tang Store in the county and city, were successively framed and extorted for 1,100 yuan by Dong Huibai, Long Baohua, and Cui Guanghua, inspectors from the Nantong District Tobacco Prohibition Supervisory Office, in collusion with Wang Jianliu, the director of the Haimen Liaison Office. The county government has investigated and apprehended Dong Huibai and Wang Jianliu the other day. The others are still at large. Yesterday (the 25th), County Magistrate Chen personally interrogated them. Dong and others confessed without denying it and were immediately put in shackles and imprisoned.</p>
<h3>Haizhou: Township Head Gathers Crowd to Snatch Criminal</h3>
<p>The Second District Office of this county recently received an order to conscript labor to dredge the Sijia Tang River. Since the start of construction, Chen Dun, Lan Ni Hong, and other townships have held biased views and refused to conscript labor, hindering the progress of the river project. The District Chief Li Shoutong petitioned the county government to dispatch Du Kuangbin, the Public Security Section Chief, to lead a security team to the construction site to supervise and urge completion by a deadline. Since Section Chief Du resided at the construction site, over 3,000 laborers from various townships have arrived and worked diligently. Recently, the projects allocated to Lianbei, Datong, Chen Dun, and Wenming townships seem likely to be completed as scheduled. However, the number of laborers from Lan Ni Hong Township is small, and the projects allocated to them have not yet reached five-tenths completion. The other day, the downstream section of the project allocated to the township was secretly dug open, causing river water to flood in and hindering the project. Section Chief Du and Zheng Huichang, the work office staff stationed at the site, ordered the laborers to quickly block the opening and pump out the water, and ordered Wu Bingyuan, the chief of Lan Ni Hong Township, to quickly double the number of laborers to arrive and complete the project as scheduled. However, Wu ignored the order. As the deadline approached, Section Chief Du, together with staff member Zheng and a squad of soldiers, went to Lan Ni Hong Street yesterday to arrest Township Chief Wu Bingyuan and escort him to the construction site. After leaving the street for about half a mile, dozens of strong men suddenly appeared in the market, each holding firearms, and chased after them, firing shots like rain. Du and others fled to Dazui Gang to hide. Unexpectedly, Qi Fengxiang and other village heads gathered 60 to 70 strong men, firing guns to intercept them and forcibly snatched Township Chief Wu Bingyuan away. Over ninety bullets for the保安隊 soldiers' Browning pistol were also seized. Du immediately reported the situation to the county government. Upon receiving the report, County Magistrate He dispatched First District Chief He to proceed to handle the matter overnight.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Handling Land Registration</h3>
<p>The declaration of urban land prices in Tongyi County has been completed, and the Land Administration Bureau is continuing to handle land registration, establishing registration offices in various districts.

After this registration, the county will proceed to clean up field taxes to solve the county's financial problems.</p>
<h3>Expansion of the District Court</h3>
<p>The Nantong District Court has seen a sharp increase in civil and criminal cases.

Prosecutor Liu Shiqing has been transferred to Shanghai, and Lu Qi has been transferred to replace him.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Lake Bandits Search and Rob Grain Transport Boats</h3>
<p>Gu Hengxing, Sha Zaichi, Han Otter Cat, and Gu Wancheng, four boatmen from Jianhe Tou in Xibeigang Township, northwest of the county, rely solely on transporting and selling grain for a living. On the 24th, after selling wheat in Youjiang, they were returning home and anchored their boats at the Hukou of Xiajia Bridge. Around 1:00 a.m., a bandit boat suddenly appeared, with thirteen or fourteen bandits who spoke with a northern accent. They boarded the four boats and thoroughly searched and robbed them. Fortunately, the money from the wheat sales had already been deposited at home. Only the clothes and small change in the boats, totaling over 100 yuan, were robbed.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Teacher-Student Adultery and Abduction Case Sent to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Wang Guisheng, a 27-year-old man from Pudong, Shanghai, was staying at the Dingtai Inn on Zuo Wei Street in Yangzhou, accompanied by a 14-year-old girl, Li Peilan. They ate and slept in the same room, appearing to be a couple. The next day, Li Jinbao from Shanghai came to Yangzhou, reported the two to the police, and took them to the Jiangdu District Court for questioning and detention. This morning (the 27th), Zhang Chunsen and Xu Tingju, bailiffs from the Shanghai Special District Court, came to Yangzhou to submit a document to the court and retrieve the prisoners. The court immediately opened a hearing and handed over Wang Guisheng and Li Peilan to the police for return to Shanghai to face charges. It is reported that Wang Guisheng and his father, Wang Xiji, were teaching in Pudong, Shanghai. Li Peilan was a student of Wang's and became romantically involved with him. Wang took over 30 yuan, and Peilan took over 40 yuan, and they eloped together, hiding in Fanshui. Because the money ran out, they sent a letter to the girl's aunt for help. The case was discovered the day before their arrest. It is said that after the elopement, the Wang and Li families had already filed lawsuits in Shanghai. After receiving the letter, her uncle, Li Jinbao, came to Yangzhou and reported the case to the police, who arrested them and detained them at the court, pending their return to Shanghai.</p>

He has already prepared plans in sections, drawn up diagrams, and submitted them to the department. The river embankment in the areas of Gong Wuwei, Gong Liuwei, and Doutian Temple on Fogan Zhou is in a critical condition and in imminent danger. Yesterday (the 25th), the county specially instructed the responsible personnel to supervise the various village heads and community leaders in the area to strengthen the defense and report at any time to emphasize the importance of the river defense.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Rice Crops Infested with Rice Borers</h3>
<p>The rice crops in the four townships of Jiaxing are currently infested with rice borers due to excessive heat, causing the rice leaves to wither and die. The earliest rice has already reached the harvest stage, and the mid-season rice is in the ear-forming stage. The insect infestation has caused the leaves to yellow and wither. The farmers have reported the disaster to the township offices and farmers' associations and requested relief. The county farmers' association has learned of this and has sent letters to the various township farmers' associations, requesting a detailed investigation and report on the disaster situation of the rice crops to be submitted to the county government for dispatching personnel to assess the disaster and reduce the land tax. The county government has also drafted methods for eliminating the rice borers, ordering the various townships to implement them earnestly to eliminate the rice borer infestation.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Aftermath of the Dinghai Fishermen and Salt Workers Riot</h3>

<h3>Interview with Wu Wentian, Section Chief of the Ministry of Industry: Continued Negotiations on Factory Inspection in the Concessions; Difficulties in Implementing the Municipal Council's Licensing System; The Principles of Politics and Diplomacy Should Consider Humanity; Hoping the Diplomatic Corps Will Reconsider and Not Persist in Their Preconceptions</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The factory inspection issue in this city has been negotiated repeatedly by the municipal government and the authorities of the Public Concession, and a draft agreement is about to be resolved. Unexpectedly, the Diplomatic Corps suddenly raised objections, and the issue has stalled again. Wu Wentian, Section Chief of the Labor Department of the Ministry of Industry, came to Shanghai on business and exchanged views with various parties. A reporter paid a special visit to him to inquire about everything, and he gave the following statement:</p>
<p>Draft Agreement Opposed by the Diplomatic Corps</p>
<p>The problem of factory inspection in the Shanghai Public Concession, after five years of negotiations, began in June of this year. The Municipal Council and the Shanghai Municipal Government jointly drafted a draft agreement on factory inspection in the Public Concession. Examining its contents, it can be seen that the Chinese government has made many concessions and, for the sake of the happiness of the majority of workers, has not hesitated to compromise with the Municipal Council. The Municipal Council also deeply understands the Chinese government's painstaking efforts and shows understanding. Therefore, the conclusion of this agreement is not easy. We were about to wait and see the implementation of factory inspection in the Concession, so that the lives of tens of millions of workers could be improved. Unexpectedly, according to reports, just as the agreement was passed by the Municipal Council's board of directors, the Diplomatic Corps considered that the agreement could lead to the abolition of some of the treaty privileges of countries with extraterritorial jurisdiction and demanded modifications. According to the Diplomatic Corps' opinion, the measures in the agreement could only be implemented in Chinese factories within the Concession and in factories of countries without extraterritorial jurisdiction. As for factories of countries with extraterritorial jurisdiction, they have the rights granted by the Yangjingbang Regulations, and the Municipal Council should handle inspection matters for these factories by issuing licenses, with provisions on the licenses to protect workers and inspect various matters within the factories.</p>
<p>The Diplomatic Corps' Opinion is Truly Unacceptable</p>
<p>Therefore, if the Diplomatic Corps' opinion is put into practice, it would mean that under one factory inspection agency, for the same country's workers in the same area, two different laws would be enforced simultaneously: (1) the Chinese Factory Law (applicable to Chinese factories and factories of countries without extraterritorial jurisdiction) and (2) the Municipal Council's License (applicable to factories of countries with extraterritorial jurisdiction). Whether this approach is fair is beyond debate. After all, the provisions of the license can never include all the contents of the Chinese Factory Law. At the same time, the abuses of the licensing system are well known. I recall that in 1932, the Municipal Council took advantage of the annual meeting of taxpayers to convene a special meeting to amend Article 34 of the appendix to the Yangjingbang Regulations, using the licensing method to obtain factory inspection rights. At that time, the Chinese people opposed it, and the Chinese government also expressed its non-recognition. Even the Municipal Council itself knew that there were various difficulties in issuing licenses and was unable to implement it. The past is not far away, how can we forget it? Now the Diplomatic Corps is bringing up the old matter again, using methods that could not be implemented in the past to implement them today. Who dares to guarantee that it will be effective?</p>
<p>Factory Inspection Seeks Workers' Welfare</p>
<p>From the political and diplomatic standpoint of the Diplomatic Corps' opinion, we are not in a position to comment. However, factory inspection is for the welfare of workers and is a social, economic, and humanitarian event that cannot be concealed by politics and diplomacy. The realization of that opinion would greatly hinder factory inspection in the Shanghai Concession, and the lives of hundreds of thousands of workers in the Concession would still have no possibility of thorough improvement. From a socio-economic point of view and a humanitarian standpoint, this cannot but be considered a great regret. If the consuls of various countries could personally visit the poorly equipped foreign factories in the Concession and see the suffering of the workers, they might be moved and change their attitude of adhering to politics and diplomacy. Moreover, according to historical concepts, politics changes with the tide of social economy. Today, when modern civilization and the rule of law are widely advocated, how can we allow people to disregard humanity? Furthermore, these countries with extraterritorial jurisdiction have a long history of factory inspection in their own countries, and their protection of workers in their own countries can be said to be meticulous. Extending this consideration to others, they should provide assistance to China, which is newly establishing factory inspection, based on their good experience. How can they use political and diplomatic pretexts to obstruct it and still claim friendship and cooperation? Who can believe that?</p>
<p>Public Opinion Supports the Implementation of Factory Inspection</p>
<p>In recent days, Chinese and foreign newspapers have commented on the Diplomatic Corps' opinion to overturn the agreement, with varying opinions and viewpoints. However, they unanimously believe that the implementation of factory inspection in the factories of the Concession is an urgent matter, and they agree that extraterritoriality is only a technical issue and should not be overemphasized. These recognized and correct views are the consensus of Chinese and foreign public opinion. The members of the Diplomatic Corps should pay attention to it! In short, the solution to the factory inspection problem in the Concession must be based on the happiness of hundreds of thousands of workers. Our government will continue negotiations, and there is still room for remedy in preserving the technical aspects of extraterritoriality. Therefore, we hope that the countries of the Diplomatic Corps can reconsider and not persist in their preconceptions, so that factory inspection in the Concession can be realized as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Anhui Agricultural Warehouse Loan Contract Signed by Syndicate and Sent to Anhui by Staff</h3>
<p>The China Agricultural Loan Syndicate is handling the mortgage loan for agricultural warehouses in Anhui Province, with a planned amount of one million yuan for this year. After the syndicate and the Anhui Agricultural Food Management Office agreed on the contract, the interest rate was set at 8.5% with a term of ten months, designating 24 counties including Fengyang as loan areas. The contract has been approved by the Anhui Provincial Government, and the official seal of the Agricultural Warehouse Management Office was sent to Shanghai. Zou Bingwen, Wu Kenyuan, and Li Zhongchu, the standing committee members of the syndicate, signed it. Later, Li Zhongchu left Shanghai on official business, so it was temporarily put on hold. Now that Li has returned to Shanghai this morning, he has added his signature, and Lu Bochang has been dispatched to Anhui to deliver it to the Management Office for signing. At the same time, he will inspect the warehouses in each county undertaking the project. Lu left Shanghai last night.</p>

<h3>Head of the Thailand Inspection Delegation, Ling Bing, Goes to Nanjing to Report on the Visit and Promote Relations; Cables Thai Regent to Thank Him for the Hospitality</h3>
<p>After the Chinese inspection delegation to Thailand returned to Shanghai, Liu Yi, Ling Xiong Dansun and Ye Xiangfa, the secretaries of the delegation, took the train back to Nanjing at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. Ling Bing, the head of the delegation, took the overnight express train back to Nanjing at 11:00 p.m. last night to report on the mission. Ling Bing and Lin Kanghou, the head and deputy head of the delegation, respectively, sent telegrams to the Thai Prime Minister, Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Economy, Agriculture, Education, and other officials, as well as overseas Chinese, to thank the Thai government and people for their hospitality.</p>
<h3>Tang Shaoyi Falls Ill, Moves into Hospital for Treatment, Scheduled to Go to Lushan at the Beginning of Next Month</h3>
<p>The New Sound Society reports that since Mr. Tang Shaoyi, a Central Committee member, returned to Shanghai from Nanjing, he initially stayed at the Broadway Mansions Hotel on the Bund. It is now learned that Mr. Tang has moved into the Shanghai Sanatorium on Rubicon Road a few days ago for treatment due to feeling unwell. Yesterday, Tang's son, Liu, told a reporter from the New Sound Society that his father had recently felt slightly unwell, so he moved into the sanatorium and declined to see relatives and friends in order to rest and recuperate. The trip to Lushan is expected to take place at the beginning of next month. The rumors circulating outside that Mr. Tang has left Shanghai for other destinations are therefore untrue.</p>
<h3>Two Notices from the Jianghai Customs</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs issued two notices, No. 1532 and No. 1513, regarding the continued exemption of dredging tax on tax-exempt export goods and re-export goods from Shanghai for another year, and the requirement for domestic goods similar to imported goods requiring sales permits to obtain domestic goods sales permits when transported to various parts of the country.</p>
<p>Notice 1: Regarding the exemption of dredging tax on tax-exempt export goods and re-export goods, this Customs issued Notice No. 1458 on July 31, 1935. Now, in compliance with the order of the Ministry of Finance, all dredging taxes on tax-exempt export goods and re-export goods from Shanghai will continue to be exempted for another year from August 1 of this year. All merchants are hereby notified. Tang Haian, Supervisor, Baron von Rahden, Customs Commissioner.</p>
<p>Notice 2: Imported goods requiring sales permits were listed in Notice No. 1521 issued by this Customs on June 23 of this year. Now, in compliance with the order of the Ministry of Finance, all genuine domestic goods transported to various parts of the country that are similar to the imported goods listed in the aforementioned table and easily confused should obtain domestic goods sales permits. All merchants are hereby notified. Tang Haian, Supervisor, Baron von Rahden, Customs Commissioner.</p>
<h3>Mechanical Industry Association Petitions the Ministry of Finance to Abolish Exorbitant Taxes and Miscellaneous Levies in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Mechanical National Goods Factories United Association submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "Regarding the long-standing imposition of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies in Guangdong Province, we earnestly request that a clear order be issued to abolish them in order to revitalize industry. Upon investigation, national mechanical goods manufactured in Shanghai and transported to Guangdong Province are all subject to heavy taxes. For example, an electric fan worth 25 yuan is valued at 50 yuan, taxed at 10%, equivalent to 20%. Moreover, various pretexts are created to heavily tax all manufactured goods. This spring, a special tax bureau for imported agricultural products and miscellaneous items was established. Although the name of the bureau clearly includes the words 'imported,' goods transported from other provinces to Guangdong must be heavily taxed by this 'imported' tax bureau before being released. Taking national rubber-soled shoes as an example, a dozen pairs are taxed at 60 cents. The taxation of other national goods can be easily imagined. Levying taxes in the name of taxing imported goods while actually heavily taxing national goods and exploiting the people is beyond compare. Previously, this association repeatedly submitted petitions to your Ministry requesting exemption, but the heavy taxes in Guangdong remain the same. The pain of industry has long been recognized. Now that your Ministry has sent a special commissioner to Guangdong Province to reorganize the finances, all the exorbitant and miscellaneous levies that have caused deep harm over the years should be promptly abolished in order to revitalize industry like a sweet rain. Therefore, we specially submit this document and earnestly request your approval to issue a clear order to abolish them. We eagerly await your decision."</p>
<h3>Yan Gantang Left Yesterday for Guangdong to Take Office</h3>
<p>Yan Gantang, the newly appointed Director of the Guangdong Telegraph Bureau, left Shanghai by the Changxing Company's Russian Empress ship at 8:00 a.m. yesterday for Hong Kong, then on to Guangdong to take office. His relatives and friends all went to the dock to see him off. Hu Mingxian, a technician specially assigned by the Ministry of Communications, also went to Guangdong on the same ship.</p>
<h3>National Sugar Production and Sales Association Cables Feng Rui to Fly to Shanghai to Preside Over the August 1st Establishment</h3>
<p>The National Sugar Production and Sales Association of China has been prepared and is scheduled to be officially established on August 1st. The temporary office is located in the Shanghai Sugar Industry Cooperative Company on Minguo Road. The future location of the association has been decided to be in the Shanghai Sugar Industry Guild on Fuyou Road, and renovations have begun. Yesterday, the association specially cabled Feng Rui (i.e., the chairman of the association), Director of the Guangdong Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, urging him to fly to Shanghai as soon as possible to preside over the establishment of the association on August 1st. No reply telegram had been received by evening. Furthermore, the document submitted by the association to the National Government for record was finalized yesterday and is awaiting dispatch.</p>
<h3>Lu Zuofu, Director of the Sichuan Construction Department, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday to Discuss Sichuan Factory Projects with the Financial Community</h3>

He was then summoned back to Nanjing. Now, to discuss the Sichuan sugar factory project with the financial community in Shanghai, he arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. He will stay for a week or ten days and then take a ship back to Sichuan.</p>
<h3>Xu Fu Allocates Funds to Maintain the Shanghai Reconstruction Public Bonds; the First Quarter Principal and Interest for This Year Have Been Paid Off</h3>
<p>The municipal government previously issued reconstruction public bonds to rebuild the war zone, originally designating the revenue from the Jianghai Customs pier as collateral for the principal and interest of the bonds. However, due to the recent decline in pier business, the revenue from the pier has been affected, resulting in a shortfall of tens of thousands of yuan in the principal and interest due for the first quarter of this year. However, the municipal authorities have always attached great importance to the credit of public bonds. Since Xu Fu became the Director of Finance, he has strengthened the reorganization of the city's finances, further consolidating the city's financial foundation. The tens of thousands of yuan that were insufficient for the principal and interest due for the first quarter of these reconstruction public bonds have been approved by the municipal government to be allocated from other tax revenues in full to maintain the credit of the bonds.

<h3>National Goods Transported to Various Places Must Apply to Customs for Sales Permits to Prevent Imported Goods from Impersonating Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>The China Times News Agency reports that the Inspector General of the Jianghai Customs replied yesterday to a letter from the Shanghai National Goods Factories United Association, stating: "Regarding your association's letter No. 1255 dated July 18, 1936, which cited a letter from the Huatong Electric Appliance Machine Factory stating that the factory's products transported to various places via the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways must be inspected by the Inspection Office, delaying the date, and requesting a letter of certification stating that the factory's products are indeed domestic goods to allow them to be released, etc., approved. According to the Provisional Regulations for the Inspection and Sales of Imported Goods, goods to be inspected that are sold domestically must apply for sales permits to be transported. The Inspection Offices established by the Customs at various stations must also inspect the goods to be inspected, even if they are domestic goods manufactured domestically, to prevent imported goods from impersonating domestic goods and being smuggled. Now, the government has stipulated that domestic goods manufactured domestically that are to be inspected must be reported to the Customs for the issuance of domestic goods sales permits when transported through the Customs to facilitate inspection and transportation. The Huatong Electric Appliance Machine Factory's products transported to various places via the two railways should comply with the regulations and apply to the Customs for domestic goods sales permits to facilitate inspection and release. The aforementioned information is hereby replied to, and we hope you will inform the Huatong Electric Appliance Machine Factory accordingly."</p>

<h3>Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Petitions for Amendment of Income Tax Regulations to Change the Tax Threshold to 50 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions submitted documents to the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "Regarding the Shanghai Sixth District Public Bus Industry Trade Union's petition requesting that the government be asked to change the income tax threshold to 50 yuan to alleviate the suffering of the people, it is reported in the newspapers that the Legislative Yuan has passed the Income Tax Regulations, which will be implemented soon. Taxes are the source of national finances and the obligation of citizens. If they benefit the country and do not harm the people's livelihood, they are happy to pay them. However, Item 1 of Category 2 of the regulations states that for those with an average monthly income of 30 to 60 yuan, the tax is 5 cents for every 10 yuan, which has a great impact on the livelihood of lower-level employees. We respectfully offer the following suggestions: Considering the high cost of living today, employees with a monthly income of 30 to 40 yuan bear the heavy burden of supporting a family of several people. They cannot refuse to support their parents, and they cannot abandon their children's education. They are already struggling to make ends meet by tightening their belts, and the decline of all industries brings the fear of unemployment. How can they bear any unexpected burdens? The foundation of the nation is to nurture the people. Taxing the poor does not contribute much to the national finances, but it causes great suffering to the people. We feel uneasy and cannot remain silent. We respectfully request that your esteemed association forward this petition to the government, earnestly requesting that you consider the difficulties of the people and grant an amendment to change the tax threshold to 50 yuan. We are extremely anxious to hear your decision." According to this, the hardship of lower-level employees is undeniable today. The points raised by the association are all based on facts. In addition to submitting separate reports, we are specially submitting this document to your esteemed Yuan (Ministry) requesting that you approve a request to the Legislative Yuan to amend the income tax threshold to 50 yuan to alleviate the difficulties of the people.</p>

<h3>Government Specially Approves Agricultural and Commercial Bank to Issue Agricultural Bonds; Methods to be Decided After Establishment; Total Amount Not to Exceed Fixed Capital</h3>
<p>The New Sound Society reports that the Ministry of Industry is jointly organizing the Agricultural and Commercial Bank with various banks. The fixed capital and the loanable funds are both 30 million yuan. After the government allocates funds and the various banks approve them, the working capital will be handled by the various banks organizing an agricultural syndicate. The eleven official shareholders and directors have all been determined. The commercial shareholders and directors will be nominated at a meeting of the various banks this week and decided on the 8th. A reporter from the New Sound Society learned from banking circles yesterday that the bureau has been specially approved by the government to issue agricultural bonds. Furthermore, Article 10 of the regulations approved by the Executive Yuan states that "If necessary, the Agricultural and Commercial Bank may submit a request to the Ministry of Industry to forward to the government for approval to issue agricultural bonds, but the amount shall be limited to the total amount of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank's fixed capital. The issuance methods shall be decided by the Board of Directors after the establishment of the bureau." Furthermore, advanced countries such as France, Germany, Britain, the United States, and Japan have all issued agricultural bonds successively, which is an important way to raise agricultural funds. Because the amount of funds required for agriculture is too large and the term is too long, ordinary commercial banks cannot assume them. All banks in our country hope to realize this as soon as possible to adjust agricultural finance.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Finance Department Cables Reply to the All-Zhejiang Association</h3>
<p>The All-Zhejiang Association in this city recently submitted a petition to the Zhejiang Provincial Government requesting a delay in the collection of the second installment of old taxes. The Finance Department has now replied by telegram: "To the Shanghai All-Zhejiang Association, your telegram has been noted with respect. Upon investigation, the Zhejiang Province's collection of arrears of taxes is limited to the period from December 1, 1935, to the day before the opening of the upper period of land tax in 1938, totaling more than two years. During this period, it is divided into five phases. We originally planned to use the method of phased repayment to allow the tax-owing households ample time to plan in advance. The first phase of collection in each county has been concluded. Now, starting from July 1, we are proceeding with the second phase of collection. In terms of taking into account the people's ability to pay, the department will instruct the counties to pay attention to this at any time. However, as it concerns the rectification of inherent tax revenues and the correction of the people's bad habits of owing grain, it is the established policy of this province and cannot be changed. We know that your association cares about local finances, and we hope you will give your full support so that Zhejiang Province's land tax can return to the normal practice of annual payment as soon as possible. We respectfully send this telegram in reply for your information. Cheng Yuanfan, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Finance Department, with seal."</p>
<h3>Members of the Expedition to Examine Historical Sites in Shouxian Returned to Shanghai Yesterday; Said that Scientific Excavation is Necessary</h3>
<p>Since a large number of bronzes were unearthed at the Lisanguidui in Zhujiaji, Shouxian, Anhui Province, on July 5, 1933, they have attracted the attention of scholars in China. However, because they were accidentally unearthed, the objects were soon scattered. Only more than 700 objects are currently preserved by the Anhui Provincial Library, which scholars regret. Last year, the Anhui Provincial Library, Anhui University, Shanghai Municipal Museum, Shanghai Municipal Library, Peking Library, Chinese Architecture Society, Archaeological Society, Oriental Culture Society, Jinling University, and the Chinese Cultural Research Institute jointly organized the Shouxian Historical Site Investigation Team, with Ye Gongchuo as the leader and Zheng Shixu as the secretary. At the beginning of this month, the team specially sent Shang Chengzuo, Hu Zhaochun, Zheng Shixu, and surveyor Li Changwen and chemical technician Cao Chunwei to conduct on-site survey work, which was completed yesterday and they returned to Shanghai. It is said that the Guidui has now been sealed off by the local government after excavation, and stagnant water and silt fill the ground. If scientific excavation is not carried out, it may be destroyed. Therefore, officials and gentry in Anqing and Shouxian are eager for the team to come to the county to cooperate. They provided the team with a lot of convenience for this survey, and the results of the work were very satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Cai Wuji Returns to Shanghai; No Definite Date for Going South; Not Confirmed that He Will Be Transferred to Head the Guangdong Bureau</h3>
<p>Cai Wuji, Director of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, went to Nanjing a few days ago to consult with Vice Minister Zhou Yichun regarding the restoration of the Guangzhou Commodity Inspection Bureau. The matter has been completed, and he returned to Shanghai from Nanjing on the overnight express train yesterday morning. When a reporter from the Central News Agency asked Cai about the date of his trip south, Cai instructed Director Chen to meet with the reporter due to his busy schedule. It was said that there is no definite date for Cai's trip south and that a decision will be made within about a week. The Guangzhou Commodity Inspection Bureau was established a long time ago. After Chen Jitang took control of the Guangdong bureau, the bureau's income and expenditure were not subject to central control, and it ceased operations in April of last year. Now that the central government has reformed Guangdong's administration, the Ministry of Industry has sent Cai to the south to restore the bureau. As for the rumors that Cai will be transferred to head the Guangdong bureau, they are not confirmed.</p>
<h3>Letter Advises Factories Not to Purchase Smuggled Industrial Raw Materials; Cai Shengbai's Letter to the Mechanical Industry Association</h3>
<p>Due to the smuggling in North China, smuggled goods have also flooded into this city. Cai Shengbai, a leader in the industrial and commercial circles, suggested to the Mechanical National Goods Factories United Association that industry and commerce should refuse to purchase smuggled industrial raw materials. The original text reads: "The smuggling in North China affects the entire country. Not only is the country's tax revenue lost, but our national industry will be destroyed. If the Chinese people continue to seek short-term profits, the harm will inevitably extend to future generations. Now, Japanese industrial raw materials are being smuggled in large quantities. Shanghai is the industrial center of the country and should advise its members to unanimously refuse to purchase smuggled goods to assist the government in strictly preventing smuggling." The association will inform all its members not to seek small profits at the expense of conscience.</p>
<h3>Commodity Exhibition Hall Receives Overseas Chinese Businessman Han Chuanhui</h3>

After viewing the superior products that could be promoted to Southeast Asia, they went to the factories to conduct on-site investigations. Mr. Han believes that the exhibits in the hall are comprehensively collected and provide great assistance to those who care about national goods. The hall then specially dispatched Fei Huiren, a staff member of the Commodity Section, to accompany Mr. Han to visit various factories.</p>

Receipts have been issued and thanked for. The enthusiasm and support of all circles are admirable.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Formulates Compound Fertilizers; Agricultural Sales Office Invests in Production; Sales to Begin at the Beginning of Next Month</h3>
<p>Our country's farmland has been using chemical fertilizers for many years. The raw materials are all imported from countries such as Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, the United States, and Canada. The Jiangsu Provincial Government is concerned that the sale of mixed fertilizers may involve adulteration or insufficient content, which may harm crops or soil. Therefore, there are strict management measures. For example, the composition of the fertilizers is determined by the Construction Plant, which studies the nature of various crops and stipulates the minimum effective composition of various chemical fertilizer raw materials. Merchants must follow the formula. The provincial government has also established a reporting office in Shanghai. Merchants must report for approval and have the composition inspected to ensure compliance with the regulations before a license is issued, allowing them to sell and transport inland. The provincial government also dispatches many inspectors to various places to conduct random checks and guide farmers on how to apply and use the fertilizers. According to the investigation, the peak season for reporting the transport of chemical fertilizers is in July, August, and September. The sales area is mostly in Jiangnan. Now, most rice crops have switched to chemical fertilizers. From March of this year to recently, 8,000 bags of mixed fertilizers and 30,000 bags of ammonium sulfate have been reported for transport. This is because soybean cakes have risen in price this year, while chemical fertilizers have a fixed price, so farmers are happy to use them. Recently, Zhejiang Province has begun to formulate mixed fertilizers on its own, with the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank investing and acting as an agent. In Jiangsu Province, the Agricultural Product Sales Office will handle it. It purchased raw materials such as nitrogen phosphate and potassium chloride in Shanghai on the 27th to prepare 4,000 bags of mixed fertilizer, each weighing 100 kilograms (equivalent to 2 Shanghai dans), priced at 11 yuan and 75 cents, for sale starting at the beginning of next month.</p>
<h3>Hongxing Hosiery Factory Workers Resumed Work Yesterday Morning, Municipal Party Department Supervised Entry, Disputes to be Mediated Again</h3>
<p>All the workers of the Hongxing Hosiery Factory on Caishi Road in the French Concession of this city, accepted the persuasion of party and government organs and resumed work yesterday morning. The labor-capital dispute will be mediated separately. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Party Department's Persuasion Since Hongxing Hosiery Factory's strike was caused by registration and dismissal of workers, and both sides had firm attitudes, the dispute lasted for a month. Both labor and capital suffered considerable losses in spirit and material. The Municipal Party Department, in order to maintain the factory's operation and the livelihood of the workers, was extremely concerned about this labor unrest. Therefore, on the 27th, it once again summoned representatives of the workers to give sincere advice. The heads of each representative group and the responsible personnel of the trade union conveyed the intentions of the Party Department to all the workers, who unanimously expressed their acceptance of the party and government's advice to resume work.</p>
<p>Resumption of Work Yesterday Morning After the Municipal Party Department received the final reply from the workers, it immediately notified the factory to prepare for work. Therefore, the factory ordered the workers to sort out the sock knitting machines and raw materials overnight. All male and female workers gathered at the factory gate at six o'clock yesterday morning. Representatives from the Municipal Party Department, together with the directors of the Second District Knitting Trade Union, supervised the workers entering the factory to work, and the order was excellent.</p>
<p>Dispute Regarding the labor-capital dispute, (1) the case of dismissing eleven workers, and (2) the request to improve treatment, the party and government organs have agreed on a mediation method, and will schedule another meeting to summon both labor and capital for mediation.</p>
<h3>Poor Households May be Exempt from Purchasing National Flags, Disposal Method for Old Flags Submitted to Central Government for Approval</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation previously heard of forced purchases during the promotion of party and national flags, and also that the existing party and national flags did not meet the standard specifications. They inquired with the Shanghai Party and National Flag Uniform Promotion Committee on how to dispose of them. The Federation has now received a reply stating that, "Regarding the issue of flag purchases for poor households, the Association repeatedly cautioned all promoters at the beginning of their work to avoid coercion, and resolved at the second committee meeting that poor households may be exempt from purchasing flags, as published in the Shen Xin and other newspapers on June 28th. This was to inform all sectors of society to avoid excessive demands. Now, in response to your letter, we are deeply regretful if some promoters have not fully understood the Association's intentions. We have already forwarded a letter to the Party and National Flag Manufacturing and Sales Bureau, urging all promoters to pay close attention. As for the disposal method for old party and national flags, we have not forced anyone to repurchase flags during this promotion, except for those with very poor shapes and colors. We have already forwarded a request to the Party and National Flag Manufacturing and Sales Bureau to submit a method for central government approval." Therefore, this letter is a corresponding reply for your information and notification.</p>
<h3>Report on Guizhou Drought Relief from Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Committee</h3>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Committee at 97 Renji Road recently received a telegram from the Guizhou Branch reporting the drought and requesting relief. It is transcribed as follows: "[Omission of opening remarks] I, your subordinate, find that Guizhou Province has many mountains and little arable land, and the annual grain production is barely sufficient for self-sufficiency in normal times. Once a famine occurs, relief is difficult. Unexpectedly, since the beginning of summer this year, there has been a prolonged drought with no rain, and the scorching sun has burned the land, causing dry fields to be entirely unplanted. Most of the planted paddy fields are also facing the depletion of water sources, and the rice seedlings are withering day by day. As of now, a famine situation has already formed. Even if rain comes immediately, it will only save less than half of the crops. Moreover, the scorching sun continues day after day with no sign of rain. The people are panicking, and rice prices have suddenly increased many times over. The existing grain reserves among the people, even if distributed to the maximum extent, are estimated to last for only three months at most. If there is no harvest in the future, the tragic state of famine will be unbearable. This committee is in charge of disaster relief and should devise methods for prevention and rescue. However, in the face of a vast catastrophe, a large disaster area, and a severe disaster situation, no moment can be delayed. This committee's ability is limited, and its heart is more than its strength. We are compelled to appeal to all philanthropists at home and abroad to show great kindness and compassion, to provide spiritual guidance and material assistance. We are extremely grateful. In addition to submitting a separate report on the disaster situation, we are sending this telegram in advance." It is also heard that the committee has recently received reports from various districts in Anhui and Henan provinces that there has been no rain since the beginning of summer, and that epidemics are prevalent, with many cases of cholera in urban and rural areas. The infection is severe, and if methods are not devised for prevention and rescue, it will inevitably expand and spread. They are urgently hoping for large donations of summer medicine and epidemic prevention medicines, and earnestly hope that all sectors of society will provide as much assistance as possible, so that they can be transported to the disaster area to save lives and provide timely assistance, which would be the greatest virtue.</p>
<h3>Xuzhou Disaster Relief Hospital Run by China International Famine Relief Commission to Close at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission at 505 Henan Road, due to the prevalence of diseases among disaster victims in northern Jiangsu, specifically allocated funds to entrust the Christian Hospital and Kunwei Hospital of the Xuzhou Christian Presbyterian Church to operate a male and female disaster relief hospital respectively, providing diagnosis and medication to maintain the health of the suffering people. Male disaster victims suffering from illness were treated by the Christian Hospital, while women were treated by Kunwei Hospital. All medical expenses, including outpatient, house calls, and hospitalization, were borne by the Famine Relief Commission. From December of last year to the present, a total of 3,596 men and 2,918 women have been treated, and the total medical expenses have amounted to more than 8,000 yuan. The most common diseases are kala-azar, followed by anemia and nephritis. According to Doctor Gu Laiya, the causes of the diseases are nothing more than starvation and dampness. Now that the flood has receded and the number of patients is gradually decreasing, the Famine Relief Commission plans to close the disaster relief hospital this month.</p>
<h3>Japanese Resident Xuansheng Case, Municipal Public Security Bureau Announces Increased Reward for Apprehending the Culprit, Additional Reward of One Thousand Yuan for Arresting the Main Culprit, All Team Members Continue to Investigate Day and Night</h3>
<p>Since the murder case of Japanese resident Xuansheng Kuangzuo occurred, the Municipal Public Security Bureau ordered its subordinates to step up the arrest of the murderer. However, there has been no new development so far. The bureau issued another announcement yesterday to increase the reward by one thousand yuan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Increased Reward</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau recently issued Announcement Zhengzi No. 15, stating, "Regarding the case of Japanese resident Xuansheng Kuangzuo being attacked and killed at 35 Alley, Qimei Road, Disiwei Road, at about 8:00 p.m. on the 10th of this month, in accordance with Instruction No. 19311 of the Municipal Government, a reward was established in two categories: (1) A reward of 2,000 yuan in national currency will be given to the leading police detective who arrests the main culprit and obtains a clear confession; (2) A reward of 1,000 yuan in national currency will be given to anyone who provides information leading to the arrest of the main culprit and obtains a clear confession." An announcement has already been issued. Now that the murderer has not yet been apprehended, a special reward of one thousand yuan is added to facilitate the arrest of the main culprit and bring him to justice. In addition to reporting and issuing separate orders, this announcement is issued for general knowledge." This announcement is dated July 24th, 25th year of the Republic of China, by Bureau Chief Cai Jinjun.</p>
<p>Day and Night Investigation</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from Dagong News interviewed the Criminal Investigation Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau regarding the latest developments in this case. According to the person in charge, "Since this unfortunate incident occurred, our team has been ordered to conduct an investigation, and in order to seek full cooperation, we convened a meeting of the heads of each team to apprehend the murderer in this case as soon as possible. However, despite various efforts in the past ten days, there has been no new development. Therefore, the chief of the general team submitted the results of the continuous investigation to the director for review and requested punishment for himself. Our team is still making the greatest efforts to continue the investigation day and night to bring this case to light."</p>
<h3>Municipal National Goods Association Asks Four Companies to Be Cautious of Smuggled Goods and Promote National Goods</h3>
<p>The Municipal National Goods Year Movement Committee of this city sent a letter to Dashin, Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, and other major companies, stating, "Our country is suffering from the impact of foreign goods dumping, and all industries are struggling, and the people's livelihood is deteriorating. Since last year, rogues and traitors have been relying on special powers to evade taxes and smuggle goods, which has spread throughout the country, enough to destroy all industries and endanger the foundation of the country. If we do not pay attention to prevention, the time when the national economy collapses will be the day when the whole country perishes. We will not need foreign soldiers to attack us, and we will have no way to save or preserve ourselves. Your company is large in scale and has a thriving business. Since you handle global goods, you should prevent smuggled goods from mixing in. We are sending a special letter to ask your company to be careful in inspecting goods when importing them in order to eliminate smuggled goods. In terms of national goods, please also make every effort to promote them in order to block leaks and maintain the national economy. We are exceedingly hopeful."</p>

Chairman Gu Xinyi first reported that shareholder Santai proposed to increase shares in order to consolidate the foundation and comply with the company law. Therefore, a meeting was specially convened to jointly study and discuss. As a result, (1) a resolution was passed to increase capital by 250,000 yuan to consolidate the foundation and maintain credibility. It was resolved that the capital be increased by 250,000 yuan, divided into 5,000 shares, each share being 50 yuan, to be fully paid at one time. Old shareholders are given priority, with each three old shares entitled to subscribe for one new share. If there are odd numbers, they will be calculated by dividing by four and taking six. Payment must be made in full within 20 days. If payment is not made by the deadline, the board of directors will raise funds separately. (2) A resolution was passed to increase the number of directors and supervisors, and a discussion will be held after the new shares are fully subscribed.

At the same time, due to the hot weather, the board of directors resolved that trading will be suspended in the afternoon from yesterday until August 7th. On August 8th, full-day trading will resume."</p>
<h3>French Concession Tobacco Exchange Industry Opposes Sanitation Fee</h3>
<p>The Fourth Branch of the Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Taxpayers' Association, the Fourth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation in the French Concession, regarding the French Municipal Council's levying of a categorized business sanitation fee on the tobacco exchange industry. The letter sent to the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association yesterday stated, "According to a joint letter from tobacco exchange shops such as Shengho Tai, Yanji, Peng Yongyuan, Dexinglong, Yikang, Ruichang, Chen Shengtai, Fuxingxiang, Hengtaixin, Jiufeng, Huitai, Hengsen, Hengyuan, Ruihe, Yongtai, Qiankangtai on Lafayette Road and Caishi Road, our shops have been operating in the French Concession for many years and have only paid patrol donations and tobacco exchange donations, and have never paid other taxes. Recently, the Categorized Business Office of the French Municipal Council suddenly sent Chinese and foreign personnel to inspect, claiming that because we also sell kerosene and candles, we must pay for a categorized business sanitation license, first paying an investigation fee of ten yuan, and we hear that we must also pay taxes on kerosene, etc., which is quite shocking. Our shops' concurrent sale of candles and kerosene is a necessary business for our industry, so the French authorities have never levied taxes in the past. At a time when the market is sluggish and the business of our industry is precarious, the French Municipal Council should try to reduce taxes so that merchants and residents can reduce their burdens in order to restore the prosperity. However, they disregard this and arbitrarily increase taxes, which is deeply incomprehensible to the Chinese taxpayers in the concession. Therefore, we jointly request that your association maintain commerce, allow us to propose negotiations, cancel the categorized business sanitation fee, in order to maintain our business and avoid public resentment," etc. In view of this, since the matter concerns the interests of Chinese taxpayers, it is reasonable to transfer the situation to your association for review and handling.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company, Chamber of Commerce Accepts Settlement, Scheduled Meeting of Creditors</h3>

<h3>Midnight Joyride with Prostitute, Car Overturns into Ditch, Zhang Zhixiang's Extreme Joy Turns to Sorrow, Hongyu Laoqi Injured in Head and Face</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhixiang, a 32-year-old from Wuxi, is currently working at the Gold Exchange. At 1:40 a.m. yesterday, Zhang and the prostitute Hongyu Laoqi from Fuzhili were riding in Zhang's car for a joyride in the countryside near Piyas Road in western Shanghai. However, the road there had no streetlights at night. The driver, Qian A'gen, saw a villager carrying vegetables on his shoulder to Shanghai for sale in the moonlight, so he swerved to the right to avoid him. As a result, the car overturned into a ditch on the side of the road due to the excessive speed. Zhang and Hongyu Laoqi were both cut on the head and face by glass. The driver, Qian A'gen, suffered a scraped right leg, but was fortunately not seriously injured. Later, they hired villagers to lift the car out of the ditch. It was estimated that only minor parts such as the front fender and glass were broken. As dawn was breaking, Zhang and others returned to Shanghai in the original car.</p>

<h3>Important Evidence in the Japanese Sailor Case: Pan Qiaoying Summoned for Testimony; Pu Provides Account of Seeing the Sailor and a Person in Western Clothing Walking; Identifies Faces of Ye Haisheng, etc., in Court, Saying She Does Not Recognize Them; In the Evening, Judge Xiao Goes to Avenue Doumer to Reenact the Scene</h3>
<p>In the case of the Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo, who was shot and killed, after the First Special District Court declared the debate closed, the Shanghai Municipal Council, as the prosecutor, presented additional witnesses. Consequently, the presiding judge revoked the declaration of closure and resumed the process of examining evidence. Summonses were issued to witnesses, and a hearing was scheduled for the 31st of this month. The female witness, Pu Qiaoying, was located in Gaoyou, north of the Yangtze River, with the assistance of local authorities requested by the police department, who sent detectives there. She was brought to Shanghai the day before yesterday and taken to the First Special Court yesterday morning. The three defendants, Ye Haisheng, Yang Wendao, and Zhou Sherong, were escorted to the court. Judge Xiao XieFen presided over the hearing in the Third Tribunal. Prosecutor Zhang Zongru was also present to perform his duties. Mr. Ru Baoyi appeared as the lawyer for the police department. However, the defense lawyers for the defendants were not notified in time, except for Mr. Tang Huaiqun, who was at the court for another case and attended the Third Tribunal upon hearing about the witness examination. The others were absent. First, Mr. Ru stated the process of summoning Pu for testimony and declared that Pu had been interrogated by the police department after the incident, and her statement had already been submitted. Judge Xiao then examined the statement and questioned Pu Qiaoying, who testified that she was from Gaoyou. One afternoon around 7 or 8 PM, she was leading a child to play in Mindefang near the Japanese headquarters on the north side of North Sichuan Road, near Jiangwan Road. While passing Avenue Doumer, she saw a Japanese soldier proceeding north on the west side of Avenue Doumer, and another person in what appeared to be black Western clothing proceeding north on the east side. The soldier was ahead, and the person in Western clothing was behind. She was walking in the middle of the road, and the two were about two or three zhang apart. The court then ordered Pu to identify whether any of the three defendants, Ye, Yang, and Zhou, were the people she saw at the time. She said she did not recognize them. As she walked near a public stove, she suddenly heard a gunshot. She did not look back but entered the stove and took another route to return to her employer's house in Yonganli, telling her employer about the gunshot she heard on the way. However, she did not say who fired the shot, and she did not remember clearly, even though her employer asked. She then resumed her laundry work and was dismissed and returned to her hometown seven or eight days later. The court then asked if she could still recognize the places she had passed. She said she still remembered. The court then questioned the three defendants, asking if they had any objections to the witness's testimony. Ye and the others shook their heads. Judge Xiao then ordered Pu to leave, and the three defendants were returned to custody to await a rescheduled hearing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the court announced the rescheduling of the hearing yesterday, the court will not be in session on the 31st. However, the court believes it is necessary to have Pan Qiaoying (previously mistakenly written as Pu Qiaoying) reenact what she saw at the scene of the incident to clarify the facts. However, as the woman has recently married and must return to her hometown today, the court decided to go to Avenue Doumer again at 9 PM last night for a third on-site inspection, ordering Pan to reenact the scene in person. The matter was kept strictly confidential beforehand, so very few people knew about it. After this reporter learned of this news, I drove there at 9 PM. At 9:20 PM, Judge Xiao XieFen of the First Special Court, along with police lawyer Ru Baoyi and clerk Ding Zhongnan, arrived at the entrance of Avenue Doumer and Yonganli by car. Soon after, police detective Kelaote and Chinese detective Fan Defu arrived with Pan Qiaoying. Judge Xiao then ordered Pan to walk to Yili Store at No. 248, eleven storefronts from the end of North Sichuan Road to the north of Huanglu Road, next to the entrance of Defang (previously mistakenly written as Mindefang; the Tiantong'an train station is a few zhang north of this fang). After arriving at the entrance of the fang, she was ordered to reenact how she returned to No. 59 Yonganli that day, passing Avenue Doumer and witnessing the incident. Pan then crossed over from Mindefang to the opposite side of the road and walked along the roadside to the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Jiangwan Road. The judge then asked if she had seen any patrol officers when she walked to this point. She replied that she could not remember. She then turned into Avenue Doumer and walked south to No. 91. Pan said that she saw a Japanese soldier and a person in Western clothing coming towards her at this location. When she saw these two people, the Japanese soldier was standing at the entrance of No. 91 on the west side of Avenue Doumer, and the person in Western clothing was on the east side (opposite No. 90). Based on the calculation of crossing the road, the person in Western clothing was about two or three zhang away from the Japanese soldier. After seeing these two people, she continued south for about seventeen ordinary steps to the entrance of No. 191 (on the east side of Avenue Doumer, marked by the Chinese boundary). At that time, she heard the gunshot. She turned her head slightly (because Pan was carrying a three-year-old child on her back, she did not turn around). She saw the Japanese soldier had fallen to the ground. The judge then ordered clerk Ding to walk from the entrance of No. 91 to the place where the Japanese soldier fell to calculate the number of ordinary steps. After clerk Ding walked, he counted a total of nineteen ordinary steps. The judge then asked Pan if the streetlights were the same as today. She replied that they were not much different. He also asked if she saw a cobbler standing at the entrance of the Gaogang Laundry Shop. She replied that she did not remember clearly. He asked if she had seen a rickshaw parked. She replied that a rickshaw was parked at the entrance of Douleranli. The judge then ordered her to continue the reenactment. Pan then walked south from No. 191 into the Shunxingyuan public stove at No. 187 (also a Chinese boundary marker). From the back door of the public stove, she turned into Lane 3 of Yonganli and returned to No. 95, the home of her employer (because the entrance of the lane of Yonganli is at the end of North Sichuan Road and there is no lane entrance. If you want to go from Yonganli to Avenue Doumer, you must pass through the back door of each shop). The judge then ordered Pan to return to the scene of the incident. He ordered someone to wear a black suit found by the police in Hong Kong owned by Ye Haisheng. He asked Pan to look at it to see if the color of the suit was similar to the color of the clothing worn by the person in Western clothing she saw that day. She replied that the colors were similar and were also long pants and short jackets. He asked if the collar of the person in Western clothing was turned up that day. She replied that she did not remember clearly. At this point, a long time had passed, and all the points that needed to be investigated had been completed. Therefore, the investigation was declared complete. Xiao and Ding then drove back to the court. Because this investigation was decided on the spur of the moment, the defense lawyers for the defendants were not notified. The three defendants, Yang, Ye, and Zhou, were not brought along. Pan had been brought to this place by the police for a reenactment eight months ago. According to her, it was a little before 9 o'clock when she went from Mindefang to Avenue Doumer, because she knew it was 9 o'clock when she returned to her employer's house, so she was able to determine the time. The date of the trial of this case will be rescheduled, it is said.</p>
<h3>Tongyi Trust Company: Resumption of Trial for Accusations Against Supervisors, etc.; Two More Creditors Join the Lawsuit; Company Failure Due to Excessive Bad Debts</h3>
<p>After Tongyi Trust Company closed down, the First Special District Court approved the declaration of bankruptcy. However, general depositors who deposited public bonds with the company and had them mortgaged without authorization are still filing criminal self-accusations of embezzlement and breach of trust against all directors, supervisors, general managers, and deputy managers. This criminal case was resumed yesterday afternoon by Judge Zhong Qing. In addition to Lu Tangji and others, Qin Yinshan and Jin Jiyun have now been added as plaintiffs. Compared with the previous four cases, the number of defendants accused has increased by one, Chen Gongqia.</p>
<p>Only Guo Yunshang, Jin Weiqin, Zhou Longzhan, and Liu Zikang, who were in custody, appeared in court to face the trial. In addition, Huang Suchu, Xu Jilu, Zhou Shouliang, Jiang Yizhi, Chuan Zhuyin, and Deng Dongming were represented by their lawyers Wang Xiaowen, Xu Shihao, Wang Youling, and Yan Yinwu. However, Liu Fangyuan, Xiong Muqu, Liu Rnsan, Wu Jingwen, and Sun Xinzong could not be summoned because their addresses were unknown. After the court session began, Judge Zhong first announced that the request to release Liu Zikang on bail had been rejected. He then ordered Liu to explain in detail the reasons for the company's failure, without any concealment. However, according to Liu, he was only one of the company's employees and did not know all the details. He only knew that the company's capital was 1.36 million yuan. As for the public bonds he kept in his custody, they had been mortgaged since March this year, all on the orders of General Manager Huang Suchu and Deputy Manager Sun Xinzong. The public bonds he processed for mortgage amounted to about one million yuan, and the mortgages were given to various banks such as Central, China, Communications, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. Mortgages from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank were</p>
<p>company real estate. Liu Fangyuan, as a standing director, went to the company every day to work. Xiong Muqu was originally the manager of the Beiping branch, then transferred to the head office and also served as a standing director for a short period of time. He returned to Peiping last summer and resigned. Other directors and supervisors who did not hold actual positions did not often go to the company. He could not know any other situation. However, the mortgage of depositors' public bonds was originally a temporary "application" nature. As far as he knew, some banks also had</p>
<p>this kind of move. Zhou Longzhan, who originally served as the chief accountant, was promoted to manager last year. I did not know about the mortgage of the public bonds of depositors. I only knew that over the years, the company had two bad debts. One was that more than 300,000 was owed by the Ministry of Finance of the Beijing government. Although this amount has been recognized by the current Ministry of Finance, there is still no way to return it. The other was the debt owed by Changzhou Tongcheng Company, totaling</p>
<p>about 1 million. The total amount of deposits received by the company, including savings and banks, was more than 4.4 million. The newly joined plaintiff, Qin Yinshan, stated that the various public bonds deposited by him and Jin Jiyun in the company had been found to have a face value of 7,400 yuan, with 580 yuan remaining in the company. Lawyers Li Junwei, Zhang Yifan, Shi Ying, and others for the plaintiffs raised several points, requesting the court to question Liu Tong and Jin Weiqin. Judge Zhong then ordered Liu Zikang to be returned to custody and the others to withdraw to await a scheduled hearing.</p>
<h3>Municipal Hygiene and Chemical Testing Institute: Entire Construction Project Completed; Funded by Mr. Hu Wenhu</h3>
<p>According to Guomin News Agency, the entire construction project of the newly built Municipal Hygiene and Chemical Testing Institute in the city center has now been fully completed. The equipment in the old institute on Guangdong Street will soon be completely moved to the new site for operation. The new site was funded by overseas Chinese businessman Hu Wenhu with 110,000 yuan. However, as a result of the construction, it is said that the budget has been exceeded. The municipal government has allocated equipment expenses of 20,000 yuan and instrument procurement expenses of 30,000 yuan. The institute covers a total area of ​​fifteen acres and has a total of five floors. The internal layout is based on the latest equipment in the world and is very scientific. The internal equipment allocation of the new institute is as follows: first floor: office, bacterial culture material manufacturing room; second floor: pathogen diagnosis and inspection room, syphilis blood test room, smallpox vaccine test room, vaccine manufacturing room, cold storage; third floor: food and beverage chemical test room, drug chemical test room, pathological parasite inspection room, medical chemistry inspection room, lecture hall, exhibition room; fourth floor: drug storage room, gas chamber; basement: boiler room. In addition, there are four small houses built next to the main house. The first is the washing room and duty room, the second is the animal breeding and experimental room, the animal dissection room, the third is the cowpox vaccine manufacturing room, the cattle feeding room, and the fourth is the quarantine cattle room.</p>
<h3>Relief Society: Donation of Disaster Relief Medicine</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Guanyin Relief Society at the north entrance of Beile Road and Avenue Joffre in Shanghai has been enthusiastic in supporting public welfare and charitable causes. The society has now received a letter from the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Disaster Relief in Various Provinces, stating that last year, the victims of the floods in various provinces were indiscriminate in what they ate and drank, resulting in the rampant spread of epidemics since summer, and they were unable to seek medical treatment, and they died miserably. Recently, the number of people writing to the association to ask for medicine has increased day by day. It is known that Guanyin Relief Pills, supervised and manufactured by your society, are very effective in preventing and treating epidemics. A special letter is written to ask for a large amount of help so that it can be forwarded and achieve the same effect as saving all. The society first donated 2,000 boxes of Guanyin Relief Pills. Fearing that it would be a drop in the bucket and insufficient for distribution, it then solicited donations from philanthropists from all walks of life in order to raise a large amount of funds and seek universal relief. At present, 3,000 boxes of Guanyin Relief Pills and 2,800 bottles of Guanyin Relief Water have been raised and sent to the Disaster Relief Association for distribution. It is said that two more batches of disaster relief medicines will be sent in the next few days. In addition, the Buddhist hospital initiated by the society has established the first clinic in the society in order to provide relief for the sick and suffering. All monks are exempt from consultation fees and medicine costs, and ordinary people are charged a low registration fee for consultation and medicine. Therefore, the number of people going to seek treatment every day is quite crowded.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Industry: Affected by Registration; Many Cars Idle Due to Few Drivers</h3>
<p>Since the public concessions and French concession in this city have successively conducted rickshaw puller registration, rickshaw merchants have been greatly affected by the business because there are many cars and few drivers. For example, the public concession limits the registration of 40,000 rickshaw pullers, but there are not as many rickshaw pullers actually pulling cars due to illness, death, or returning to their original hometowns north of the Yangtze River for various reasons. In addition, the French concession has suspended registration since the 10th of last month for more than a month. There are not a few people who have come to Shanghai from the countryside to prepare for registration and make a living by pulling carts, but they have returned to the countryside because they could not wait. Therefore, in the past, in hot weather like today, only 30-40% of the cars in each rickshaw line were idle. Now, the average number of cars on the street in the morning and evening shifts is less than half. Therefore, in the north and south cities and special districts, wherever there are more rickshaw lines, cars are connected and parked on the side of the road, which is full of them. However, the expenses of rent, donations, and labor are not reduced at all. Therefore, the price of cars has plummeted. Public concession cars (that is, cars with three-sided notices) are only more than 200 yuan per car, while those in the north and south cities are about 100 yuan. If this continues, the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of poor people will be extremely worrying. The authorities should quickly provide relief to avoid the rickshaw merchants and pullers from falling into a desperate situation.</p>
<h3>No Discovery at the End of July: This Year's Cholera May Be Avoided; Seaport Quarantine Office Announces that the Rumor that Cholera Was Discovered in Ningbo Was a Misinformation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Seaport Quarantine Office of this city released the following information on the status of infectious diseases in the port of Shanghai last week: Three Chinese people contracted smallpox, and two died. Three Chinese people contracted epidemic meningitis. Twenty-nine Chinese people and eight foreigners contracted typhoid fever. Twenty-three Chinese people died. Nineteen Chinese people and three foreigners contracted bacterial dysentery and amoebic dysentery. Six Chinese people and one foreigner contracted diphtheria. One Chinese person died. Five Chinese people and three foreigners contracted scarlet fever. A total of sixty-five Chinese people and fifteen foreigners contracted infectious diseases, and twenty-six Chinese people died. According to Secretary Zhou Zhongqian, although it is the end of July, no true cholera has been discovered in Shanghai. All ports in the country are also very peaceful. As for the report that cholera was discovered in Ningbo, the Yinxian government has investigated and reported that it was misinformation. Therefore, this terrible cholera epidemic may be avoided this year.</p>
<h3>Car Driving into the Huangpu River Case: Family of the Deceased Sues the Shanghai Municipal Council; Requests Compensation for Losses of 180,000 Yuan; The Shanghai Municipal Council Says It Cannot Be Held Responsible</h3>
<p>On the morning of May 16, a car was driving along Yangshupu Road, and when it reached the end, it still did not realize it, causing it to drive into the Huangpu River. Seven people in the car died. The families of the deceased then filed a lawsuit against the Shanghai Municipal Council in the consular court, claiming that the facilities on the road were not properly equipped, causing this disaster, and demanding compensation for losses of 180,000 yuan. The lawyer of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Bolang, has filed a defense with the consular court, stating that the Shanghai Municipal Council cannot be held responsible for compensation in this case. The fault lies with the driver of the car for driving carelessly. The driver and the passengers knew that this road could lead to the new fish market. At that time, they were going there and should have turned into Dinghai Road and crossed the Dinghai Road Bridge, and should not have driven straight. The passengers knew that the driver had taken the wrong road, but they did not warn him, so they cannot be excused. Furthermore, this car belongs to the owner of a certain fish shop. On that day, the people took it to the fish market without the owner's permission, so it should be requested to cancel this case and order the plaintiff to pay the litigation costs. The date of the trial of this case has not yet been determined. It is said that it will be heard in September.</p>

<h3>Passenger on the "Gongping" Steamer Jumps into the River</h3>
<p>On the 24th of this month, a lone passenger purchased a 6 yuan official cabin ticket from the China Recruitment Agency in Nanjing and boarded the China Merchants Bureau's "Gongping" steamer to Shanghai. At midnight, the waiter saw him sitting alone on the deck, enjoying the cool air. After a while, he suddenly disappeared. A check of his room revealed a set of Shandong silk Zhongshan clothing, a pair of yellow leather shoes, 4.5 yuan in banknotes, a briefcase, a copy of the Huiwen Gongji, and a national government emblem with the number 1590. It was known that he must have jumped into the river and died. After the ship arrived in Shanghai, it telegraphed Nanjing to inquire, but there was no news. The customs waterway police station reported and ordered detective Huang Songsheng to board the ship for investigation. He was instructed to preserve the belongings in the purchase office for investigation and recognition.</p>
<h3>French Concession Police Cracked Down Again: Red Pill Operation; Main Culprit Min Hongsheng Arrested; A Large Amount of Drugs, etc., Seized</h3>
<p>Detectives Liu Kunbao, He Zongyu, Chen Tinghuai, and Gao Meihui of the French Concession Police learned that someone was selling red pills and morphine on the top floor of No. 11 Dongxinli, Maidiean Road. They rushed to the address around 10 PM the night before last and arrested Qian Qinglang, a 36-year-old Chongming native who was selling the drugs. They seized 500 red pills, seven small packets of morphine, one red pill, and one pipe. They were taken to the police station. Based on Qian's confession, they continued to No. 171 Xizilaihuo Street and arrested Tang Ziming, a 37-year-old native of Liuhe, seizing a small amount of opium and morphine. They then went to No. 77 (Hengmaoli Entrance), opposite the Xiaocai Market on Rue Mercier, and arrested the morphine boss, Min Hongsheng (42-year-old native of Tongzhou), his assistants Lu Sanzi and Lu Hegui, and customers Li Agui, Li Deming, Hu Xuchu, Chen Jinfu, and Xiao Wenbing. Eight people were arrested. They found thirteen small packets of morphine, forty-five red pills, and a pipe in the hidden part of the latrine and took them back to the police station. Yesterday, the ten people arrested in the three cases were handed over to the Second Special Court. Presiding Judge Wang Gangxu presided over the preliminary hearing in the First Criminal Court.

<h3>Fire in Nanlinli: Two People Injured in Falls</h3>
<p>At around 11 AM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in the home of Yu Chen, a 33-year-old woman from Shaoxing, at No. 148 Nanlinli, next to Tianbaoli, Haining Road, Zhabei. The fire brigades from various sections rushed to the scene and put out the fire in more than an hour. It was estimated that in addition to the rear part of the house at No. 148 being destroyed, the houses at Nos. 147 and 149 on the left and right were also affected. Nos. 150, 151, and 152 were slightly damaged by water. When the fire was raging, a woman named Zhu Zhang, a 22-year-old native of Shandong, was trapped inside the house at No. 148 because the stairs had been burned down. She jumped out of the back window and injured her face. At the same time, a firefighter named Ding Xiquan, a 34-year-old native of Wuxi, from the second section of the fire brigade, was injured in the head and face when the floor collapsed because he did not know that the floor had been burned down. The injured man and woman were sent to Renji Hospital in Maijiaquan, the concession, for treatment by ambulance. It was said that the injuries were minor and not life-threatening. Afterwards, Xuan Shanyu, the patrol officer of the Tianbaoli Police Station in charge, sent police officers to bring Yu Chen, the fire starter, to the station. According to her, she was a tenant of the third landlord and rented the back of the reception room. Her seven-year-old daughter, Qiaosheng, carelessly played with matches and set fire to the mosquito net. She could not put it out in time, causing this disaster. After verifying the confession, Officer Xuan immediately escorted Yu Chen to the Menggulu Police Station for transfer to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Son of Lawyer Yang Guoshu, Yang Mengyu, Accused of Attempted Fraud; Yao Mingdian Wanted to Seek a Job with the Railway Household Affairs Department and Entrusted Yang to Find a Way to Issue a Check for 500 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yao Mingdian, a local resident living on Zhaojia Road in the South City, wanted to seek a job with the Railway Ministry in Nanjing but had no opportunity. In December last year, he asked Yue Ren Yang Mengyu (Jia Ju, the son of lawyer Yang Guoshu) to find a way. On December 20, he paid Yang a check for 500 yuan. However, after a few days, because there was no news, Yao notified the bank to stop payment, so the check could not be cashed. Yang Mengyu then filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai Local Court against Yao for issuing a check without sufficient funds. After the trial, Yao was found not guilty. However, the Prosecutor's Office of the Local Court believed that Yang Mengyu's behavior was suspected of attempted fraud. Therefore, the Prosecutor's Office formally filed a public prosecution with the court. Because Yang Mengyu was repeatedly summoned but failed to appear in court, an arrest warrant was issued. At 11:10 AM the day before yesterday, a bailiff No. 15 was specially sent to the First Special Court to issue another arrest warrant and go to No. 110, Lane 315, Tongfu Road, together with the Chinese detective from the Chengdu Road Police Station to arrest Yang Mengyu. He was taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to Criminal Court No. 8 of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case, saying that the defendant confessed in the police station that the victim in this case, Yao Mingdian, had asked someone to find a business opportunity and that he had introduced him. Therefore, all the checks had been handed over to Party A. Later, because the check could not be cashed, Party A negotiated with him, and he paid 500 yuan. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit against Yao in the local court for abuse of the check. During the court hearing, because he was not in Shanghai, the case was lost. After the bailiff surrendered, he requested to be transferred. Yang Mengyu hired lawyer Huang Yiyan to appear in court as his defense and requested that lawyer Mu be responsible for taking him to the local court to surrender. Judge Tan Xinzhen verified the confession and ordered Yang Mengyu to allow lawyer Huang Yiyan to be responsible for taking him to the Shanghai Local Court immediately to surrender and await interrogation and detention.</p>

<h3>The China Merchants Bureau Vigorous Bid Invitation: To Realize the Government's Reorganization Plan; Many Have Been Requesting to Read the Articles of Association These Days; It is Expected that There Will Be an Enthusiastic Response from Bidders When the Deadline Arrives</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the state-run China Merchants Bureau recently received instructions from the Ministry of Communications to publicly invite bids for various wharf handling services. An announcement has been made, and it is said that many people have been requesting to read the articles of association in recent days. It is expected that there will be a very enthusiastic response from bidders when the deadline arrives. According to sources at the Bureau, this bidding invitation for handling services is part of the government's plan to reorganize the Bureau's affairs and must be implemented in accordance with the Ministry's instructions. However, after the implementation, the experienced workers on the docks will still be the existing workers, but a small number of contractors may need to be changed. As for the employees related to wharf affairs, they should understand the policies set by the government and fulfill their duties to maintain transportation. Furthermore, in February of this year, President Chiang of the Executive Yuan issued a proclamation on rectifying Bureau affairs, which stated, "Some may be misled by malicious elements from the outside world, sowing discord, instigating unrest, and affecting the progress of the Bureau's business. This President will regard this as a violation of discipline and damage to transportation and will severely punish them according to the law, without any leniency. In addition, employees of various branch bureaus, warehouses, and docks who engage in such behavior shall also be punished equally." Currently, it is a critical period, and transportation issues are of great importance. Those who are used or seduced by others will be severely punished to uphold the law, it is said.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Volunteer Corps Annual Shield Competition: The Chinese Team Still Holds the Top Position; Seventh Time Achieving the Honor Record</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Volunteer Corps, in order to encourage competition among the teams and to assess attendance, has a prestigious silver shield for the overall team performance competition. It is calculated annually and announced at the summer break to determine the ranking of each team and who will win the shield. It is now known that the results of the Corps' last team performance have been announced. After comprehensively reviewing the various operational and shooting scores from the past year, the Chinese team still ranks first in the Corps. Therefore, the shield should continue to be held by them. According to records, the Chinese team had previously won the shield three times under the leadership of Hu Yunqiu and Wang Yanjing. Since Chen Shixia became the team leader in 1932, they have won it for four consecutive years. Therefore, this victory is the seventh time the team has won, breaking the Corps' record. Chen's consecutive victories are a remarkable achievement. This fully demonstrates the progressive spirit of the Chinese team and the diligence of their efforts.</p>
<h3>Staff Housing at Tongwen College: A Fierce Epidemic Breaks Out; The Municipal Council Diagnoses it as Malignant Meningitis</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily News, the staff housing at Tongwen College is now surrounded by a terrible epidemic, creating an unusually terrifying situation. On the 28th at noon, the three-year-old daughter of Professor Lin, Meina Zi, and the two-year-old daughter of Professor Fukuda both died of dysentery. Professor Kageyama's daughter also contracted the disease shortly after being sent out of the school gate with Professor Fukuda's daughter's coffin. Professor Lin's six-year-old daughter also has little hope of survival. In addition, Professor Fukuda's wife, Professor Kumano's two daughters, Professor Kageyama's two daughters, and the daughter of Mr. Tsukuda all suffer from the same disease. The staff housing is almost completely destroyed. It is said that the Municipal Council diagnosed the disease as "malignant meningitis dysentery." Currently, all the residences in the college are filled with fear and trembling. Every day, they only consume tea and dried plums, and avoid other foods and drinks. At the same time, in order to avoid the epidemic, they are urgently packing up and returning to Japan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Huang Lijuan Sues Kong Zuan: The Defendant Did Not Appear in Court Yesterday, and the Hearing Was Postponed; Huang Arrived in Court Holding Her Daughter with Tears in Her Eyes</h3>
<p>Kong Zuan, a Cantonese owner of the Renhe Weaving Factory on Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession, met Huang Lijuan, a woman from Changsha and a friend of his girlfriend, in Guangdong at the end of 1933 through the introduction of his girlfriend. In the early spring of the following year, they both came to Shanghai together and first lived in the YMCA dormitory. In March, they had sexual relations at the China Hotel and later rented a house in Sichuan Lane on North Sichuan Road and lived together. In July of last year, Huang gave birth to a daughter. Later, they moved to Gao Fu Lane on Avenue Foch. Huang repeatedly urged Kong to hold a wedding, but it did not happen. She also found out that Kong already had a wife and concubine. Furthermore, Kong's affection gradually faded, and he eventually abandoned her. Huang then filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special Second District Court, accusing Kong Zuan of seduction, abandonment, and disrupting the family, requesting a trial in accordance with the law. After Judge Zhang Chaozuo summoned the plaintiff for several hearings, the details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, both parties were summoned to the Second Criminal Court for a hearing, but the defendant, Kong Zuan, did not appear. A lawyer appeared in court, stating that the defendant was unable to appear due to illness. The plaintiff, Huang Lijuan, arrived in court holding her daughter with tears in her eyes, requesting that the defendant be arrested and brought to justice. The court, due to the defendant's absence, announced that the hearing would be postponed to August 3rd. If the defendant still does not appear at the next hearing, an arrest warrant will be issued.</p>
<h3>Trial Screening of "Red Begonia": A Dispute Arises Over Attending; Bumper Opera Performers Ren Lingzhi and Others Lead a Crowd to Cause Trouble Because They Were Not Allowed to Attend</h3>
<p>The domestic film "Red Begonia," produced by the United Company and co-produced by the Star Film Company, is directed by Zhang Shichuan and stars the bumper opera actress Bai Yushuang. The film also features Star actors Wang Xianzai, Gong Jianong, Shu Xiuwen, Wang Jiting, Huang Naishuang, and others. The filming of the movie recently concluded, and a trial screening was held at the Central Grand Theater on Six Ma Road after midnight. According to the rules, this type of trial screening is confidential, as editing and modifications are still required after the trial. All companies hold these screenings after a new film is completed. However, only members of the company are allowed to attend these trial screenings. After its recent reforms, the Star Company has implemented scientific management in all its facilities. Therefore, for this secret screening of "Red Begonia," admission tickets were distributed in advance, and those without tickets were not allowed to enter. Unexpectedly, at the beginning of the screening, bumper opera performers Yu Lingzhi, An Guanying, and Huo Zhuzi heard about it and went to request to attend. The Central Grand Theater's staff refused them because they did not have tickets. After a long argument, Yu Lingzhi and others left in anger. Not long after, they gathered more than two hundred hooligans, who swarmed in, shouting, applauding, and causing extensive damage. The trial screening of "Red Begonia" was halted halfway through. The Central Grand Theater then telegraphed the police station, who dispatched officers to disperse the crowd.</p>

<h3>Jin Tongyin Grieves Over the Loss of His Son</h3>
<p>Jin Xiansun, the eldest son of Jin Qiansun, a respected elder from Jiaxing, was only in his early twenties. He was excellent in character and academics, having studied at Fudan University, Datong University, and the School of Political Science and Law, always excelling among his peers and earning the praise of his teachers. However, his body was weak, and he studied diligently, which led to him contracting lumbar tuberculosis. He received multiple treatments from his uncle, Dr. Jin Wenqi, and other renowned Chinese and Western doctors, but it would recover and then relapse, never being completely cured. In the past month, his condition suddenly worsened, affecting his lungs, stomach, and other organs, and he passed away at 7 PM on July 26th, at the young age of 21. Yesterday, the coffin was placed at the China Funeral Home on Hart Road. It is said that it will be temporarily stored for a few months before being transported back to his hometown for burial. The Jin family has many friends, but due to the loss of a young family member, few announcements were made. However, friends and relatives who came to express their condolences yesterday morning were endless, all lamenting his loss, it is said.</p>
<h3>Minhang Ferry Manager Zhan Weizeng is Indicted for Negligence Resulting in Death; Investigation Clarifies the Facts</h3>
<p>Yang Bingsheng, the sixteen-year-old son of Yang Dianchen, a policeman at the First Branch Bureau of the County Public Security Bureau stationed in Minhang Town, was an apprentice at the Feilong Motor Shop on Jiuguo Road in the town. On the evening of the 11th of this month at around 9 PM, he went to the railing of the Minhang Ferry Terminal of the Highway Administration Office of the Construction Department to cool off due to the hot weather. He soon fell asleep. Unexpectedly, he was kicked by Zhan Weizeng, the ferry manager, and injured, causing him to fall into the river and drown. After the deceased's father, Yang Dianchen, reported the incident to the local court, Prosecutor Xiao Jinying arrived at the scene to examine the body. Zhan was summoned for questioning and released on bail pending further investigation. Zhan Weizeng also accused Yang Dianchen of assault. It is now known that Prosecutor Xiao has indicted Zhan Weizeng for negligence resulting in death. The facts of the crime are as follows: Yang Bingsheng, the son of Yang Dianchen, was sleeping on the shore of the Minhang Ferry Terminal on the night of the 11th of this month because of the heat. Zhan Weizeng, the ferry manager, kicked Yang Bingsheng under his right eyelid because he should not have been sleeping on the dock. When Yang Bingsheng woke up in fright, he could not discern the direction and was also blinded by Zhan Weizeng's flashlight, causing him to lose his footing and fall into the river and drown. Afterwards, Yang Dianchen negotiated with Zhan Weizeng and was assaulted by him. (Evidence and relevant legal provisions) Yang Bingsheng died of drowning after being injured while alive, which has been verified. The injury was inflicted by the defendant. Li Afu and Zheng Buyun, who were sleeping with Yang Bingsheng at the time, witnessed the incident. Li Afu was also awakened by the defendant's kick at the same time, and his testimony is highly credible. Yang Bingsheng drowned because he was kicked awake from a deep sleep, causing him to lose his senses and lose his footing. This has also been confirmed by Li Afu and others. Therefore, Yang Bingsheng's death was caused by the defendant's negligence, which is beyond doubt. The defendant's assault on Yang Bingsheng and Yang Dianchen, and negligence resulting in Yang Bingsheng's death, constitute offenses under Article 277, Paragraph 1 and Article 276, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and should be prosecuted according to the law. A public trial will be held soon. As for Zhan Weizeng's accusation against Yang Dianchen for assault, the prosecution was dropped. The reason given was that the defendant's son, Yang Bingsheng, was negligently killed by Zhan Weizeng. The defendant negotiated with Zhan Weizeng, and they fought. The defendant inflicted a minor injury on Zhan Weizeng's left elbow. However, considering the defendant's motive for committing the crime was that his son was kicked and drowned by Zhan Weizeng, his situation is extremely pitiful and should be dismissed in accordance with Article 232 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: In yesterday's news column of your esteemed newspaper, there was an article about the establishment of the Chinese Taoist Association. In it, the name of the elected alternate executive committee member was Wang Yili, (the "li" character should be changed to "ting"). Also, the name of the alternate supervisory committee member, Liu Yongxiang, was also transcribed incorrectly. The candidate with the most votes for alternate supervisor was Chen Leshan, so Mr. Chen should be the one elected. We request that you correct these errors to ensure accuracy. Chinese Taoist Association, July 28.</p>
<p>To the Editor: We have recently received a letter from our member, Zhenhua Yarn Factory, stating that they were shocked to read in the newspaper that the entire internal machinery, spindles, etc. of our factory had been purchased by a foreign company and were being reorganized and dismantled. Our factory has temporarily suspended operations due to the high cost of raw materials and unfavorable calculations, and there has been absolutely no sale. We hope that you will forward this letter to various newspapers for correction in order to reflect the truth. We would be grateful for your assistance. To the Editorial Department of the Shen Bao, Secretariat of the Chinese Yarn Factory Federation, July 28.</p>
<h3>The Egg Industry of Shanghai (Continued) (An Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce, Part 33)</h3>
<p>— Compiled by China Credit Information</p>
<p>(6) Business Conditions</p>
<p>In the Shanghai egg business, frozen eggs are directly exported by the factories, while egg products are handled by export firms. In the past, when selling to foreign merchants, there was a guarantee that the goods would not spoil for four months. This led to some cunning foreign merchants being overly critical, arbitrarily returning goods. Moreover, with the instability of foreign exchange rates, foreign merchants would adjust their acceptance and return of goods based on the rise and fall of the pound sterling. Many egg merchants went bankrupt as a result. Later, after public discussion, the bad practice of guaranteeing goods was abolished, eliminating losses in sales. Last year, the government reformed the currency system, and egg merchants had more security due to the stability of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Regarding the future of the business, based on our institute's investigation, we are optimistic. First, the government is supporting the egg industry, such as reducing tax rates and guiding improvements. Officials and merchants can cooperate well. Second, any egg products from our country are of excellent quality, and foreign merchants cannot find any flaws. Third, industry leaders such as Mr. Zheng Yuanxing have visited Europe and America several times to investigate the production and sales of eggs, and are familiar with the situation. Knowing the enemy and oneself makes it easier to control the situation. Fourth, the industry has realized that competition is not a good strategy, and are cooperating sincerely with each other. Even foreign egg factories have established new names and joined the Shanghai Egg Industry Association. As for the embargo on Chinese eggs by various countries, our government authorities have, together with egg merchants, been actively seeking countermeasures. With these factors, the fate of the egg industry will not follow the path of silk and tea.</p>
<p>(7) Market Price of Eggs</p>
<p>Egg prices depend entirely on supply and demand. Secondly, the seasons also have an impact. Generally, prices rise in winter and fall in summer. Frozen eggs are directly exported, so there is no market price in Shanghai. The following is a comparison of Shanghai egg prices in the past year, to get a glimpse of the trend: Monthly Price Chart of Fresh Eggs (Unit: 100 Jin, Yuan)</p>
<p>(8) Analysis of the Shanghai Egg Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai egg industry can be divided into four categories: egg factories, traditional egg factories, export firms, and egg shops. Among them, egg shops have the longest history. The Chengyutang Public Office was the old-time group of this industry. Later, it joined with egg factories to form the Shanghai Egg Industry Association. The association is located at 1127 Shanshou Lane, Broadway Road, with more than 30 members. Traditional egg factories also have an Egg Factory Association, located at 19, Lane 145, Tianjin Road. It is said that the two associations are planning to merge for the sake of unity. The following is a detailed description of each category:</p>
<p>There are currently six frozen egg factories, five foreign-owned and one Chinese-owned. Each factory has strong capital, and some also operate various animal products. Banta has the oldest qualifications and specializes in egg products. Jardine Matheson and Bering, British merchants, have factories in Shanghai and branches in Qingdao. Maocheng Company, a Chinese merchant, is the only frozen egg factory in China today. The head office is located at 229 Huangpu Road, Shanghai, and the branch is located at 4 Shanghe Road, Qingdao. The internal organization is divided into the purchasing department, factory affairs department, export department, and transportation department. It also has a cold storage department and a branch in London, with agents in various countries. Due to sufficient resources, outstanding talent, and excellent credit, it has achieved its current position.</p>

<h3>Summer Chinese Clothing</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>The best conditions for clothes worn in summer are "comfort," "simplicity," and "lightness." Our domestic fabrics and tailoring styles happen to meet these standards. No wonder Westerners living in Shanghai are also changing to Chinese clothing and swaggering along the road with Western steps (see the previous Japanese newspaper). Indeed! Domestic fabrics, such as spun silk, Xiangyun yarn, and summer cloth, are light, thin, and durable, and do not stick to sweat. Moreover, Chinese clothing styles are loose, cool, and extremely comfortable. They are also very convenient to put on and take off, and the price is cheap. A gown for about ten yuan and a set of shirt and trousers for about ten yuan are already top-quality goods. Even washing is very simple. A clever servant in the home can wash them clean and iron them neatly. On the other hand, wearing a suit is not so comfortable and economical. The fabric of suits is always white drill or white canvas, which is thick and worn on the body, providing no coolness at all. Moreover, the waist of the trousers is the same size as the body, plus the pockets, it is almost like a pair of lined trousers in Chinese clothing. Do you think it is hot to wear? The thin shirt on the upper body, although said to be loose and comfortable, but you cannot just wear a shirt in formal occasions. Adding a tie or bow tie, and then wearing a thick coat, it is really terribly hot. Moreover, a basic suit costs about twenty yuan; plus, not everyone can wash it, taking it to a laundry shop also costs several dimes. Think about spending so much money to get uncomfortable, what's the point! So, in the summer, I advise those who wear Chinese clothing not to be envious and learn to wear suits; even those who wear suits may as well switch to domestic Chinese clothing, and compare which is more comfortable and convenient.</p>
<p>However, Chinese clothing also has some inconveniences. The gown is really too long, making it inconvenient to get on and off vehicles, walk, and work. General Ma Zizhen once advocated shortening the length of the gown to the knees, which is truly convenient and beautiful.</p>
<h3>Contributing Words: The Domestic Goods Industry Should Take the Lead in Using Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>— Yang Fei</p>
<p>I often say that to promote domestic goods, it is better to rely on ourselves than on others, and it is better to persuade people within the domestic goods industry than those outside it. In particular, those of us who serve the domestic goods industry should take the lead in practicing what we preach. This is more effective and easier to promote.</p>
<p>First method: The domestic goods industry should organize a large group. Everyone who serves the domestic goods industry must purchase and use domestic goods, and must purchase and use domestic goods produced by the factories of this group. Anyone who purchases and uses domestic goods produced by the group's factories is entitled to preferential prices or discounts.</p>
<p>Second method: All comrades who serve the domestic goods industry must swear to use domestic goods. The whole family, old and young, male and female, must use domestic goods. If it is found that non-domestic goods are purchased, the factory or store leader should impose the most severe punishment, or even dismiss or fire the employee.</p>
<p>Third method: All interpersonal interactions, congratulatory gifts, and condolences of people who serve the domestic goods industry should use domestic goods gift certificates. Anyone who holds domestic goods gift certificates to purchase goods at domestic goods companies or factories should be given special treatment.</p>
<p>Fourth method: Domestic goods factories should introduce their products to each other, so that colleagues in each factory have the habit of purchasing and using domestic goods. At the same time, factories should sign contracts with each other, setting preferential terms, so that each can obtain goods at favorable prices.</p>
<p>Fifth method: Each factory or company should organize a cooperative, and the clothing, food, housing, and transportation of all members should be based on the principle of using domestic goods. Later, bonuses will be determined based on the amount of domestic goods purchased.</p>
<p>This work of the domestic goods industry itself is also the basic work of promoting domestic goods, and in fact, it is the minimum work of using domestic goods. If this point can be implemented, there is still bright hope for the future of domestic goods. Otherwise, empty talk will not help in practice, and the word "promotion" is still equivalent to nonsense.</p>
<h3>Promoting Domestic Goods and Revitalizing Rural Areas</h3>
<p>— Tang Zenggeng</p>
<p>Our country is known as an agricultural country, and farmers account for the vast majority of the population. Since the misfortune of rural bankruptcy, the countryside has been in a state of death. On the one hand, this is indeed due to the adversity of natural and man-made disasters, which has made the countryside an irreparable situation. On the other hand, we cannot but say that the giant claws of imperialist economic aggression have stretched into the countryside, causing it to be covered in endless gray. Therefore, the countryside has been in a long-term decline, and farmers have suffered permanent pain. The saying that we are an agricultural country may be fundamentally shaken?</p>
<p>Here, let us temporarily set aside the first reason for rural bankruptcy—natural and man-made disasters—because this is not within the scope of this article. Now, let us talk about the second reason for rural bankruptcy caused by imperialist economic aggression.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the economic aggression of imperialists has brought misfortune to every member of China. They use Chinese raw materials to manufacture goods, and then sell them back to China. In this process, the invaders' pockets are filled, while China's money flows out. How can the country's wealth not cause extreme panic? How can the rural economy not feel infinite distress? Therefore, if we want to revitalize the countryside, we must start with promoting domestic goods.</p>
<p>To make domestic goods penetrate into rural areas, to enable rural areas to be revitalized, and to eliminate the traces of imperialist economic aggression in rural areas, I think we should pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>1. Promoting the domestic goods manufacturing industry can revitalize the rural economy: To make domestic goods penetrate into rural areas, we should strive to promote the domestic goods manufacturing industry to go to rural areas, so that every idle farmer can obtain a means of livelihood, and the rural economy can gradually improve. This requires the government authorities to increase their supervision and encouragement, and establish more domestic goods manufacturing factories, so that rural areas can restore their vitality.</p>
<p>2. Establishing domestic goods service agencies to make farmers happy to use domestic goods: We admit that the belief in foreign goods has now deeply influenced the minds of farmers. They consider using foreign goods to be the supreme glory. This can be said to be a major problem of rural bankruptcy. Therefore, now that we want to revitalize the countryside, we hope that people from all walks of life will work together to establish domestic goods service agencies, and try their best to introduce domestic goods to rural areas and to farmers, and also have to make efforts to persuade them to be happy to use domestic goods, and to eradicate the psychology of believing in foreign goods.</p>
<p>3. Establishing domestic goods training institutes to enable farmers to acquire knowledge of domestic goods:</p>
<p>For this item, we need teachers engaged in rural education to do some work. Please ask them to join several schools and establish a domestic goods training institute, and invite farmers to listen to lectures to impart to them very simple knowledge of domestic goods. We do not seek profundity, but only popularity, so that they can understand the main cause of rural bankruptcy, and so that they know the knowledge of using domestic goods. With such earnest persuasion, farmers' knowledge of domestic goods will gradually increase and they will reject foreign goods.</p>
<p>Although the relief of rural bankruptcy cannot be achieved solely by the above three points, it can at least provide some assistance under the general mobilization to revitalize the countryside. Here, I deeply hope that government authorities, people from all walks of life, and the teachers and ladies who are responsible for relieving the countryside, will work hard to reverse the misfortune of rural bankruptcy and step up our rural revitalization.</p>
<h3>A Record of Mr. Tan Yutian, Inventor of Radio-Controlled Boats</h3>
<p>— Cun</p>
<p>Tan Yutian of Nanjing is a handsome young man, only about 30 years old this year. Originally from Guangdong, he has lived in the Northeast for many years, studying electrical machinery for seven or eight years. He is the author of various books on radio principles, repair methods, design methods, circuit diagrams, and double heterodyne design methods. He witnessed the heartbreaking scenes of the Northeast's fall, so he worked hard to study, in order to contribute to the country in the future.</p>
<p>His motivation for experimenting with radio-controlled boats began three years ago. He only started manufacturing in August or September of last year, creating a small radio-controlled boat that is three and five-tenths feet long, displaces one cubic meter, and has a payload of 62 pounds. In addition to the motor, the boat is equipped with a receiver, controller, etc. During the test, a transmitter with a wavelength of 74 meters was installed on the shore. By pressing the components, the electric boat can be induced to move freely left, right, forward, and backward. In the future, after expansion, it can also be equipped with guns, smoke screens, searchlights, and other components to complete a perfect electric warship.</p>
<p>Due to economic reasons, Mr. Tan spent 400 yuan to build this small electric boat. When he tested it at Xuanwu Lake in the capital a few days ago, Mr. Tan stood on the shore and turned the transmitter. The electric boat gradually left the shore. If he wanted it to go east, it would go east. If he wanted it to go backwards, it would go backwards. His preliminary research has been completed with satisfaction.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Tan is preparing to carry out his second major plan. He hopes to cooperate with the Ministry of Transportation and other agencies, and hopes that the government will provide material and spiritual assistance to fulfill his wishes. In addition, he is also researching an ultra-shortwave motor of one meter to five meters, which can be carried around and communicate with a few miles away. It is said that it will be successful in half a year.</p>

<h3>World Games Basketball Tournament: China Will Play Japan on the 7th; Friendly Matches Against Peru and the United States in the Next Two Days</h3>
<p>(Special Correspondent of the Central News Agency, Berlin, 28th) The Chinese basketball team to the World Games is scheduled to play two friendly matches against Peru on the 29th and the United States on the 31st. The official match against Japan will be held on August 7th.</p>
<h3>The Colorful Scenes of the World Games: Owens Practices the 100 Meters in 10.4 Seconds; Keifer of the United States Can Beat Japanese Swimmers in the 100 Meter Freestyle</h3>
<p>National Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 27th, Although the German capital has been raining heavily for several days and the tracks are muddy, the training of the World Games athletes and the various lives in the World Games are still undiminished. The American athletes have been here for several days and have become accustomed to the climate here, and their skills are becoming more and more sharp. The black man Owens practiced the 100 meters on the muddy track and still achieved 10.4 seconds, and the 300 meters achievement was 30.5 seconds.</p>
<p>Today is the friendly match and practice in the World Games. Australian 800-meter competitor Back house accepted the 2,000-meter challenge from Argentine representative Anderion. As a result, the Australian athlete won in 2 minutes and 31 seconds. Australian high jump expert Metcdfe and Canadian celebrity Goe Haly once negotiated, saying that they would tie when they jumped over 1.85 meters, and would not go any further.</p>
<p>The head coach of the American swimming team talked about Keifer, a member of the team, saying, "This man can be said to be invincible." If Japanese swimmers can get a score of 1.07 in the 100 meters, Keifer will definitely be able to have a record of 1.05, or even shorter than this time. Since the American swimming team arrived here, the Japanese swimming athletes have disappeared without a trace. It is rumored that the Japanese athletes are secretly practicing in a lake in the suburbs, so that outsiders cannot see their superb skills.</p>
<p>In addition to daytime training, each athlete, with the permission of the coach, also visits various scenic spots. However, most of the athletes in the World Games Village do not leave their homes. They will recognize this village as their second home. In this new village, from the theater to the concert, all athletes are satisfied. As for the delicious food in the kitchen, it goes without saying.</p>
<p>But as of today, only half of the athletes have arrived, so the World Games Village is still relatively quiet.</p>

<h3>Record of the World Games Team's Accompanying Journey (Letter No. 4) Central News Agency Special Correspondent Feng Youzhen</h3>
<p>The flag of the British Empire, where the sun always shines, is truly felt to be great when we step out of our country's borders. Since leaving Shanghai, we have passed through Hong Kong and Singapore, all of which are its colonies. Now, we have arrived in Colombo, the capital of Ceylon Island, and soon we will go to Bombay in India. These places are all British territories. The maritime route between Europe and Asia is almost entirely encompassed by it. Britain, based on a mere three islands, has achieved such great development. This makes the people of our ancient nation feel only shame and nowhere to hide.</p>
<p>Ceylon Island is located at the southern tip of India and is a territory directly under British administration. Colombo is the capital of Ceylon Island and the center of the Indian Ocean sea route, as well as the first important port on the Indian Ocean coast. The British have established a governor to govern Ceylon Island, and the governor resides in Colombo. The mail ship arrived in Colombo at noon on July 4th. Colombo faces the Indian Ocean. To prevent waves from impacting and to avoid wind and waves, the Ceylon government has built two stone dikes in the ocean, surrounding a small bay. The construction of the stone dikes is very majestic and grand. Outside the stone dikes, turbulent waves crash, creating water splashes more than ten feet high, falling like a fountain in bursts. Although we are already tired of sea travel, we only find such scenery magnificent and lovely. Inside the stone dikes, the water is clear and calm, with many giant ships and warships anchored.</p>
<p>The mail ship docked in the bay at noon. Due to passport checks, it was not until 2 PM that we began to disembark. The distance from the docking point to the shore is several hundred meters. The mail ship company prepared a small ferry to pick up passengers. Many people missed this ferry and had to take a commercial ferry, which cost one rupee (the Ceylon currency, equivalent to one yuan and three jiao in the national currency). They all exclaimed that they were very unlucky.</p>
<p>There are not many overseas Chinese in Colombo. The pier was deserted, and no one came to welcome us, so after going ashore, everyone acted freely. The mail ship was scheduled to set sail at 8 PM, giving us plenty of time to tour the city. Many owners of automobile businesses came to solicit business, offering three-hour tours of the city for one pound per car (six people per car). So everyone split up and set off in groups. There were also many thrifty friends who simply strolled around the nearby streets and browsed the shops.</p>
<p>The reporter, along with Chu Anping from the Central Daily News, and Wu Demao, Shao Rugan, Jiang Lianggui, and Hou Luoxun from the inspection team, rode in one car. We first went to the telegraph office to send a telegram. After sending the telegram, the chauffeur drove to the gas station to refuel. When the car stopped, many dark-skinned locals came to give us a few flowers. We gave them ten cents, but they still complained. This kind of disguised beggar is everywhere. If you walk on the street, you will be entangled by them endlessly.</p>
<p>The car drove around the city for three hours. We could not even call it a fleeting glimpse. Now, I will just say a little about the surface situation of Colombo to give those who have not been there a simple outline.</p>
<p>The roads in Colombo are also flat and wide. Perhaps in all imperialist colonies, this little bit of material civilization can always be enjoyed. Many tall foreign firms stand tall, forming a modern city. However, the houses of the locals are small and dirty, not harmonious or commensurate at all. The most lovely thing is the many tall trees, lush and shady, everywhere like a garden.</p>
<p>The means of transportation on the street, besides a few cars and rickshaws, are still mainly bullock carts. The structure of the bullock carts is very heavy, with a wooden board sandwiched between two iron giant wheels. A semi-circular awning made of sugarcane mat is built on top, even taller than a small house. Depending on the size and weight of the cart, one or two oxen are used to pull it. They walk slowly and continuously on the street, not only making the streets very crowded, but also leaving cow dung everywhere, which is extremely smelly. Especially in the small streets, it is nauseating.</p>
<p>The crows in Colombo can probably be considered the boldest of their kind. They are everywhere in the streets and open spaces. They are certainly not afraid of people. Even when cars rush by, they simply take a few steps and give way, just like those veteran road inspectors, and do not spread their wings and fly high. Everyone, seeing this situation, said with a smile that Colombo can be called the world of crows.</p>
<p>Colombo does not have anything particularly admirable or memorable. We acted as road inspectors for three hours and only stopped at two places. The first was Victoria Park. The entire park is very large, with lush trees and flourishing flowers and plants. The scenery is very quiet. The city hall next to the park is one of the most magnificent buildings in the city. The boundaries between the white people and the locals' recreational areas in the park are very strict. The area nearby is mostly the residence of white people. When the chauffeur explained this to us, he showed a very envious expression. The second place we stopped was the Shakyamuni Temple. People who go to the temple must take off their shoes. We also followed suit at the entrance. A temple attendant (actually a guide) accompanied us inside. The temple is octagonal in shape and not very large. There is a corridor all around, and the middle is the Buddha hall. In the Buddha hall, there is a statue of a large Buddha and several small Buddhas. The walls are painted with many pictures about Buddhist stories, some with modern decorations. Everyone laughed and said that the Bodhisattva has also become modernized. To the west of the Buddha hall, there are also several side rooms. One room has a marble statue of Guanyin, which is very exquisite. In the corridor, there is also a reclining Buddha more than two feet long, which can be called magnificent. The difference between this temple and Chinese temples is that there are no incense candles inside, and it is exceptionally clean, not at all like the messy appearance of Chinese halls. When we were in the Buddha hall, the guide gave each person a fresh flower, saying that it could bring good luck. Everyone, of course, smiled it off. When leaving the temple, he asked us for money. Many people gave him one yuan, and some gave a few jiao. When putting on shoes, many locals competed to help you put them on, and of course, they could not do without money. In the eyes of the locals, there is nothing more important than money.</p>
<p>The "Curry" chicken in India and Ceylon is very famous. Everyone was tired of eating the big mountain rice on the ship and went to try something different. A plate of rice with a piece of chicken costs one rupee, but there is no "Curry." Another plate of "Curry" chicken is another half a rupee. The taste is not particularly unique. It was really a small deception.</p>
<p>Ceylon is famous for producing pearls, gems, tea, and graphite. The chauffeur drove us to a jewelry store. Although the storefront was not very large, it displayed many pearls and gems, which were truly dazzling and beautiful. The shop assistants were very attentive, taking this and that to show you, and saying how fair the prices were, and that you could earn several times the interest in Europe. However, none of us wanted to be jewelers, so we only bought a few landscape postcards to get it over with.</p>
<p>The brown-skinned Ceylonese locals have dark, shiny skin. Because they like to eat betel nuts, their lips are dyed bright red, like basins of blood. Poor locals do not wear clothes on their upper bodies, and their lower bodies are wrapped in a piece of cloth instead of pants. Both men and women are bareheaded and barefoot. However, students are neatly dressed in shoes and socks, showing that this nation is also making progress to some extent. Locals carry goods, except for the heaviest ones using bullock carts, and the rest are carried on their heads. We often see many men and women on the street, carrying a very tall bag on their heads, walking lightly, without showing any signs of effort. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Stipulates Salaries for Primary School Principals and Teachers</h3>
<p>(Zhenjiang News) The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education issued an instruction to the education bureaus of various counties yesterday, stating, "Upon investigating the salary standards for primary school principals in various counties, they are generally determined based on the amount of local education funds. As a result, the amounts are uneven and the differences are too great. In poor counties, the monthly income of primary school teachers is often insufficient to provide for their own basic needs, which is highly inappropriate. At the same time, although the principle of paying salaries based on qualifications is the same, the distinctions in qualifications are also uneven. This Department has long been determined to adjust this situation, but because the sources of education funds in various counties cannot be increased with the current resources, and the differences are very large, a comprehensive plan must be carefully decided to avoid excessive favoritism or bias, which would further increase difficulties. Now, we have received an instruction from the Ministry of Education, ordering us to immediately plan methods to increase the salaries of primary school teachers. At the same time, the 24th year has ended, and the 25th year's education budget for each county is being finalized. Therefore, the adjustment measures should be promptly drafted and promulgated. Therefore, based on the current situation of each county, we have formulated 17 articles of the Temporary Measures for Salary Standards of County-Level Primary School Principals and Teachers in Jiangsu Province. In addition to issuing separate orders, we are also issuing them for the information of the county. Please promptly revise or draft your county's own measures in accordance with the provisions of Article 16 of the said measures and submit them for approval and implementation. Urgently."</p>
<p>Standards for Salaries of County-Level Primary School Principals and Teachers in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>I. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education has formulated these measures in order to implement the Ministry's order to increase the salaries of primary school teachers, adjust the salary standards of primary school principals and teachers in various counties, and improve educational efficiency. II. The qualifications of primary school principals and teachers are divided into the following five grades: Grade A: Graduates of normal universities, university education colleges, education departments, higher normal schools, and vocational normal schools. Grade B: Graduates of old-system normal undergraduate programs, high school normal programs, and special normal programs. Grade C: Graduates of provincial rural normal schools and those who have passed non-examination qualifications. Grade D: Graduates of provincial and county-level teacher training classes and those who have passed examination qualifications. Grade E: Those who meet the qualifications of substitute teachers under primary school regulations. III. Monthly salaries of primary school teachers must be determined according to the qualification grades in the preceding paragraph, with a difference of two to four yuan between each grade. However, the starting salary grade for each grade of teacher must comply with the following provisions: Grade A qualification: Starting salary of at least 20 yuan. Grade B qualification: Starting salary of at least 18 yuan. Grade C qualification: Starting salary of at least 16 yuan. Grade D qualification: Starting salary of at least 14 yuan. Grade E qualification: Starting salary of at least 12 yuan. IV. Full-time teachers of primary schools who concurrently serve as principals of two grades or less should be promoted one grade at the start of their salary, and those serving as principals of three or more grades should be promoted one and a half grades. V. Full-time teachers of senior primary schools should be promoted one grade at the start of their salary. Those who concurrently serve as principals of two-grade complete primary schools should be promoted two grades, and those serving as principals of four or more grades should be promoted three grades. VI. Elementary primary schools should be based on a first-grade teacher. If the number of students exceeds 35, they can be promoted one grade for every 10 additional students. If there are more than five, they can also be promoted by half a grade. If there are three or more grades, and the average number of students per grade reaches 50, one additional subject teacher may be added. However, full-time teachers will not be promoted, and subject teachers should be paid at the lowest grade. VII. Senior primary schools should be based on two grades, two full-time teachers, and one subject teacher. If the number of students in each grade reaches 40, full-time teachers may be promoted one grade, and subject teachers may be promoted half a grade. For every five additional students above 40, they should be promoted once according to the proportion. This calculation applies to schools with three or only one grade of senior primary school. VIII. If the number of students in each grade of senior primary school is less than 30, the full-time teacher's salary will be reduced by one grade. If the number of students is less than 25, the school will be closed or merged. If the number of students in each grade of elementary primary school is less than 35, the full-time teacher's salary will be reduced by one grade. If the number of students is less than 30, the school will be closed or merged. IX. Teachers who are promoted due to an increase in students may be demoted at any time according to the reduced number of students. X. The number of students stipulated in the above articles may be appropriately increased or decreased by each county after approval from the provincial government, based on local conditions. XI. Principals and teachers who work diligently and achieve excellent results and are commended or praised by provincial and county superintendents may be promoted one or two grades. Those who continue to strive for excellence may be promoted again. However, those who make progress backwards may also be demoted at any time. XII. Those in each county who have already been given a labor bonus may be promoted by several grades, maintaining their original treatment, but they should still be subject to promotion and demotion at any time in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article. XIII. Schools should submit the resumes and supporting documents of the teachers they intend to hire to the education bureau or the third section of the county government for approval of the starting salary grade within one month before the start of each semester. If the qualifications are not met, the section may order the school to hire another teacher or directly appoint one. XIV. Each section should conduct a teacher registration once every two months before the start of each semester. When teachers with qualifications in the A, B, C, and D categories who have already registered cannot all be hired, teachers with E qualifications may not be hired. XV. The number of students at each level should be calculated on the average number of students seen by school inspectors. However, children under the age of six and students who have completed their study years should be excluded. XVI. For expenses standards in all grades of schools where the standards are calculated based on school level or that do not have defined treatment grades, and where the conditions set for pay standards do not meet the standards set in these regulations, a plan for standards should be set separately and submitted for approval and implementation. If the original grade expense budget for each grade exceeds the minimum standards set in these measures, the starting pay grade should be appropriately raised, but should not exceed the original budget scope. For school grades that are unable to support the original treatment, a temporary plan should be prepared to provide the lowest grade pay as defined in these measures with General Reserves, Common Righteousness Education Funds, or other sources of funding from other funds to fulfill the conditions as set in these measures. XVII. These measures shall be resolved by the Provincial Government Committee, promulgated, and implemented.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Education Institution Personnel Going Abroad for Research Examinations in Mid-August</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang News: In order to encourage the staff of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Institution to study diligently, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education will, starting from the 20th year, annually examine current personnel of the provincial education institutions in the province who have graduated from colleges and universities and have served continuously for more than five years with achievements and who are natives of Jiangsu to go abroad for research. This year, it has been decided to select one person each (one in natural science and one in social science). Anyone who wishes to take this examination can ask the person in charge of their original institution to register with the Department of Education before August 15, and the physical examination will be held on August 16, and the examination will be held from August 17 to 19 (at Nanjing Central University). The examination subjects for general subjects are Party Principles, Chinese Language, Local History and Geography, and the Language of the Country of Study. The specialized examination subjects are: (1) Calculus, (2) University Physics, (3) Inorganic Chemistry, (4) Organic Chemistry, (5) Analytical Chemistry (for those who take the natural science examination), (1) Modern World History, (2) World Political Geography, (3) Educational Psychology, (4) Educational Administration (for those who take the social science examination). Candidates can choose three of the above two categories of specialized subjects for the examination. The calculation of examination results is that Party Principles, Chinese Language, and Local History and Geography in the general subjects account for 25% of the total score, the language of the country of study accounts for 25%, and specialized subjects account for 50%. After being admitted, they will be sent abroad for research, with a period of two years. The number of monthly allowances is regulated at (English) 30 pounds, (German) 350 marks, (French) 1,600 francs, and (American) 100 gold dollars. The cost of going abroad is 80 pounds for English, German, and French, and 400 gold dollars for American. However, because the price of gold has risen, there is no surplus for tuition, so starting from this year, it has been decided to stop issuing family allowances.</p>

<h3>Finance: Fundamental Shakeup on Multiple Fronts - Gold Market Plunges - Result: Another $1.20 Loss</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market was even more sluggish, with the fundamental shakeup on multiple fronts becoming increasingly evident. Sellers dominated the market throughout the day, causing prices to fall to the 30 yuan mark, only one yuan away from the closing price. Initially, overseas silver markets showed a slight contraction in the UK and were flat in the US, with reports suggesting that there were buyers at the quoted price after the market closed. Sellers quoted prices above 0.062. Forward silver prices in Monterey rose by 5 hao, varying up to 2.5 li. The price of raw gold in London fell by half a penny, and exchange rates slightly decreased.

However, there were still many who were selling. The HSBC quoted prices were flat for both British and American currencies. At this time, spot dealers made slight advances but remained hesitant. After entering the market, the Silver Equalization Tax was revealed to be slightly less by half a point, and sellers took the opportunity to act, causing a further decline. However, large speculators bought in on the cheap, slightly pulling up the price. Ultimately, due to the fundamental shakeup on multiple fronts and oversupply, the price fell further to the 30 yuan mark at noon. Swap prices were quoted by buyers at 3 yuan to 3.1 yuan, while spot to September futures was quoted by buyers at 2.5 yuan. The market conditions for the first half of the day are recorded below.</p>

<p>The closing price, as quoted by the Central Bank's standard gold price, was reduced to 1129 yuan, about 1 yuan higher than the closing price, slightly less than the previous closing price. This month's registered price is 1123 yuan, August's is 1127 yuan, and September's is 1130 yuan. The morning water replenishment price is 1123 yuan. The red gold price is calculated by adding 8 yuan, resulting in 1139.2 yuan. The spot market conditions are weak, with Tianjin goods calculated by adding 11.7 yuan, and raw red advances calculated by adding 10 yuan, with a selling price of 12.5 yuan, but there are no buyers. The current standard gold price swap for September futures is 2.5 yuan between Jinfu and Yu Mao Yong, etc. The August to September swap is 3.1 yuan for 21 contracts between Da Decheng and Tongfeng Heng, and 3.05 yuan for 133 contracts between Fuda and Yi Cheng, and 3 yuan for 28 contracts between Fuyu and Yi Cheng.</p>
<p>There was not much trading in the market. In summary, Qia Fengyong, Shengyuan Yong, and Da Decheng Qingfayong were buyers, while Tong Tai Chang, Tongfeng Heng Chunyuanyong, Fuyu Qianchang Xiang, and Dingkang were sellers. Yi Cheng was both a buyer and a seller.</p>
<p>The market conditions for the first half of the day were generally weak. The opening price was 1131.2 yuan, and the closing price was 1130.1 yuan. The highest price was 1131.3 yuan, and the lowest was 1130 yuan, with a fluctuation of 1.3 yuan. The result was a decrease of 1.2 yuan compared to the previous close.

<h3>Chinese Merchants Still Liquidating; Exchange Rates Weak Despite Attempts to Tighten</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange market was still crowded with Chinese merchants, and attempts to tighten the market were thwarted. Initially, overseas telegrams reported that London's large contracts were down by 125 points, both near and far. It was reported that transactions took place above the quoted price of 0.0625 after the market closed, and there were buyers at the quoted price, while sellers quoted prices at 0.0625 and higher. The New York silver market was unchanged, forward silver prices in Monterey rose by 5 hao, varying up to 2.5 li, the price of raw gold in London fell by half a penny, the British currency against the US currency was unchanged, the US currency against the British currency decreased by 3.125, and the British currency against the French currency was unchanged, the US currency against the French currency decreased by 25. The Central Bank's quoted prices were flat for both British and American currencies, and the Customs Gold Unit remained unchanged. The exchange market opened with a recent selling price of 1 shilling and 2 pence 4375 for British currency and 30.1875 yuan for American currency. Compared with the previous close, both the British and American currencies were flat. After opening, the Bank of Japan settled exchange rates. HSBC's quoted prices were flat for both British and American currencies, and the situation was quite stable. After entering the market, Chinese merchants continued to liquidate. The Silver Equalization Tax was revealed to be less by half a point. However, because the banks maintained, the overall trend was still flat. After entering the market, banks exchanged futures, making the situation even more hesitant. Later in the market, banks bought British currency and sold American currency, and Chinese merchants continued to liquidate, making it difficult for the trend to improve. Midway through the market, banks slightly counteracted each other, causing the market to hover. Near the close, the recent selling price was slightly weaker at 1 shilling and 2 pence 4375 for British currency and 30.1875 yuan for American currency. Compared to the previous close, the British currency tightened by 64/1, and the American currency was flat. The forward prices were also the same. Chinese merchants slightly bought 200,000 yuan of shillings and US dollars. The day's transactions are recorded below.</p>
<p>The opening price for the recent selling price of British currency was 1 shilling and 2 pence 4375. Huabi sold to Mitsui September 375, Huabi sold to Youli, Mitsui sold to Shanghai, Macgalie sold to Xinfeng spot 4375, Da Ying bought Shanghai Mitsui August 40625, and sold to Yanghang September 375. Later in the market, Shanghai bought August 375 and 4375 in exchange, Zhengjin sold to Citibank spot 4375, Huabi bought August 375 and 4375 in exchange, Chaoxian October 3125 and 375 in exchange (hedging British currency exchange rate 1 shilling and 1 pence 96875 strong), Citibank bought August 375 and 4375 in exchange, closing selling price spot 1 shilling and 2 pence 4375 weak, August 375 strong, September 375 weak, October 3125 strong, November 3125 weak, bid price adjusted accordingly.</p>

<h3>Securities: A Sudden Surge - Class A Bonds Reach 70 Yuan - A Reversal Begins...Result Still Up 0.9 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange began trading September futures. The market continued to trend upward. However, after rising too high, it triggered a slight reversal, resulting in a fleeting and volatile situation. Class A bonds reached 70 yuan, a sudden surge that seemed too rapid. This led many long positions to take profits and close out positions, causing a slight pullback after the large rise. The trend inevitably weakened. However, the uneven distribution of gains and losses showed that many were specializing in pushing up the price of Class A bonds in an attempt to deceive others. Although there is still an upward trend in the future, it is likely to be limited. If it can stabilize for a while, it would be fortunate for the long positions. Yesterday, the opening saw continued and strong upward momentum, which intensified even further later on. August Class A bonds surged by 1.25 yuan. September bonds, which were newly listed, immediately opened across the board and were even higher than the recent bonds, indicating that the long positions were very bullish. The excessive increase in Class A bonds led to an inverted yield curve, revealing a slight weakness, and a reversal began immediately. In the secondary market, numbers 48 and 51, as well as numbers 4, 33, 54, and others, were sold off one after another, causing a reversal to begin. Class E bonds were stable and did not rise, and the trend has changed its path, leading to a loss of confidence. Class B bonds fell by a maximum of 0.6 yuan, while Class A bonds only fell by a small 0.3 yuan, so the downward trend is not significant. As a result of yesterday's market prices, excluding the new September contracts, August contracts still saw a consistent increase of 0.35 to 0.9 yuan. The total transaction volume was 8,695,000 yuan. Today is the settlement day for the July futures, and the market is closed for one day. The comparative results of the overall gains and losses are listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Many Scatter, Leaving the Market - Little Progress in the Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to decline, and the downward trend is particularly strong. This is because long positions have no intention of adding to their positions after settlement, and at the same time, a portion of the long positions are leaving the market, which makes the short positions feel more active, and the market is showing an increasingly strong downward trend. However, spot yarn transactions are gradually developing in the south, but market sentiment is still difficult to boost.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Continues to Drop More Than a Yuan</p>
<p>In the previous market for standard yarn, the market chips were loose, buyers were scarce, and sentiment was low. In addition, many rumors were circulating that were unfavorable to long positions. The market decline became increasingly severe, with each month falling by 1 yuan to 1.2 or 1.3 yuan. The second and third markets were sluggish. By closing, the decline in the distant months was even more severe. As a result, each month fell by 1.8 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. Jin Chang sold 1050 bales, Mingde 750 bales, Zhengda 950 bales, Hexing 1200 bales, Gengfeng 1050 bales, Senkang 500 bales, Changyu 650 bales, Shenji 750 bales, Taichang 850 bales, Changfeng 1450 bales, Runkang 1650 bales, Xiacheng 1200 bales, Yongchang 1400 bales, and Xincheng 1500 bales. Chengji bought 1900 bales, Deda 700 bales, Tongji 750 bales, Juxing 800 bales, Yuda 1800 bales, Dafeng 750 bales, Daji 1550 bales, Yongyu 850 bales, Fengtai 750 bales, Yida 1900 bales, and Dachangcheng 600 bales. The high, low, and closing prices for the first half of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Weak Spot Yarn Sales and Price Drops</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. A total of 845 bales were bought by various merchants throughout the day, and the price dropped by 1.2 yuan. The purchase amounts of each merchant are as follows:</p>
<h3>Under the Control of Natural Forces - More New Cotton is Being Dumped</h3>
<p>The cotton market is experiencing a decline in old cotton, and the situation is extremely weak. This is due to the unfavorable market conditions, which are being controlled by natural forces. Therefore, the market price is becoming increasingly difficult to support. New cotton is being dumped more actively due to the favorable weather conditions and healthy growth. However, Indian cotton futures are gradually rising.</p>
<p>Old Cotton Drops by a Small 1.5 Yuan</p>
<p>In the previous market for standard cotton, US cotton fell by 2 to 7 points, while Indian cotton rose by 2 rupees 75 to 12 rupees. Osaka’s three-grade cotton fell by 6.7 jiao for near-term and 2.3 jiao for far-term. Market sentiment was very weak. Due to abundant rumors and favorable weather conditions, new cotton production is promising. Therefore, short sellers became very aggressive. The momentum of August old cotton became increasingly weak. As a result, old cotton fell by 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day’s closing price, while new cotton fell sharply by 4, 5, and 6 jiao. Hengyi sold 2500 dan, Zhengda 1600 dan, Hexing 4800 dan, Fengtai 1800 dan, Shenji 2400 dan, Renfeng 1200 dan, Dachangcheng 2400 dan, Runkang 2400 dan, Xiacheng 1500 dan, Yongchang 2000 dan, and Changhe 6100 dan. Deda bought 1500 dan, Dafu 1100 dan, Chengji 6400 dan, Tongji 2300 dan, Juxing 1200 dan, Daji 1900 dan, Senkang 1500 dan, Tongfeng 5400 dan, Yichang 1500 dan, Changfeng 1600 dan, Hengchang 1500 dan, and Ruiyuan 1100 dan. The high, low, and closing prices for the first half of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Cotton Mills Suspend Operations for Spot Cotton</p>
<p>The consumption of spot cotton remains suspended, and most factories are taking a wait-and-see attitude. The source of supply is Yao cotton, with 280 bales.</p>
<h3>Increased Cotton Fields Near Taicang</h3>
<p>This year, the cotton fields in Taicang and its surrounding areas have seen a large increase. This is because cotton prices have risen, and rural farmers are happy to plant cotton. Jiangyin County has increased by 20%, and other counties have increased by 10%. The total area of cotton fields is 1.56 million mu. The production status in all areas is exceptionally lush. If there are no typhoons or rainstorms to destroy the crops in the future, there should be a rare harvest in recent years.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Falls, Indian Cotton Rises - Slight Declines in Three-Grade Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with good news from Liverpool. Brokers and foreign merchants bought, and Oklahoma experienced a lack of rain last week. All months rose by 18 to 22 points. Later, long positions closed out, and local New Orleans merchants and cotton farmers unanimously sold short. Oklahoma is forecast to have rain. Although there are storms near the Louisiana coast and the Bahamas, and there is rain in the central region, this could not reverse the downward trend. There were limited outside buyers, and most industry players took a wait-and-see approach to see how the new cotton would fare. Spot cotton was firm, and textiles became increasingly sluggish. The closing was flat and weak. Spot cotton fell by 7 points, and futures fell by 1 to 7 points. British cotton spot rose by 9 points, and futures rose by 4 to 10 points. Indian cotton spot merchants, Japanese merchants, and operators bought in large quantities. With long positions closing out, Pingguo rose by 2.75 rupees, Aomula rose by 3 rupees, and Bairo Creek rose by 2.25 to 3 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated 27th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay on the 28th, the opening forecast was: July-August Bairo Creek at 233 rupees, down 1.75 rupees; April-May Bairo Creek at 222 rupees, down 1.25 rupees; December-January Yimla at 201 rupees, down 1.75 rupees.</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay on the 27th, the quantity of cotton exported from Rangoon last week totaled 535 tons, of which 25 tons went to Hamburg, 10 tons went to Antwerp, 482 tons went to Kobe, and 18 tons went to Melbourne.</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Osaka on the 28th, three-grade yarn futures fell by 0.1 to 0.4 yuan, with the near-term at 211.8 yuan and the far-term at 206.9 yuan. Cotton futures fell by 0.25 to 0.6 yuan, with the near-term at 69.6 yuan and the far-term at 65.9 yuan.</p>
<p>Bombay's Cotton Market Unstable Last Week</p>
<p>Bombay's cotton market was greatly affected last week due to long positions selling again after obtaining benefits that were almost equivalent to export subsidies. As a result, foreign consumers, especially Japan, were able to purchase cheaper cotton. The futures market was extremely unstable. Any rumor was enough to cause sellers to dump their holdings. It was reported that a large quantity of spot cotton was shipped to Japan. However, due to good weather conditions, the market remained sluggish. More rain has been received and is still needed. The statistics for last week are attached below (unit: thousands of bales).</p>
<p>US Cotton (unit: thousands of bales)</p>
<p>Egyptian Cotton (unit: thousands of Qingtai)</p>
<h3>Food: Northern Port Water Fees to Increase - Flour Alone Rises for August</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was calm in the morning after the opening because this month has already been settled, so there should be no problems. For August and subsequent months, due to the quoted prices of foreign wheat, Chicago rebounded by 3, 4, or 5 jiao, and Canada was good by 4 jiao. Industry sentiment could not help but stabilize, and due to market rumors that water fees will increase from August 1st, Tianjin merchants have been rushing to load goods in recent days. The market has stabilized, which is likely due to this reason. For September and subsequent months, sentiment is naturally concerned about the abundant harvest of new rice in various places, and many long positions have retreated. The market atmosphere is generally flat and weak. After observing the subsequent movements, it is feared that the subsequent market will gradually decline.</p>
<h3>Spot Merchants Frequently Hedge - Wheat Futures Gradually Soften</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw a slight stabilization of sentiment in the morning due to foreign wheat prices rising by 3, 4, or 5 jiao. However, the factory demand for ground wheat remained lukewarm, and customers with spot wheat frequently hedged, causing the market atmosphere to gradually weaken. As for the far-term contracts, the increase in value for each month was ultimately around 0.1 yuan, which was too large. Therefore, by comparison, sentiment gradually changed. The recent sharp drop in the far-term was not without reason. Although the spot wheat market remained nominally strong, it was actually loosening. This is because factories only accept very high-quality wheat, and anything below medium-quality is not purchased. The very high-quality wheat purchased by the factories yesterday ranged from 4.55 yuan to 4.5 yuan, with total transactions of over 3000 bags. However, it is reported that Japanese merchants purchased 8000 to 9000 bags of medium-quality wheat, with prices slightly higher than those purchased by Shanghai factories.</p>
<p>Delivery for July wheat futures is underway, and it is reported that over 20 railcars have already been delivered, with the total estimated at over 60 railcars.</p>
<h3>Hakka Xian and Sichuan Merchants Expand Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>There has been a continuous stream of Hakka Xian rice arriving in recent days, with many inferior grades. Merchants and retailers are eager to sell off their stocks. The middle-level firms are even willing to lower prices, as most of the inferior grades are generating heat and cannot be stored any longer. Furthermore, new rice has already been released in various places, and it is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon. The samples from various places are better than in previous years. Therefore, sentiment and market conditions continue to decline. Yesterday, the market initially showed signs of decline. However, Sichuan merchants suddenly made purchases in the market, which boosted the market. Furthermore, the Sichuan merchants are aiming to provide relief to the disaster-stricken areas of the province, and their demand is very high. They reportedly need to purchase and ship 200,000 shi in Shanghai and 100,000 shi in various ports along the Yangtze River. They are specifically selecting medium-grade rice for price stabilization and disaster relief. Yesterday, approximately 4000 bags were purchased, all of which were medium-to-inferior grade rice. The total volume of Jiangxi rice traded for the day was 5742 bags, and the total volume of Hunan rice traded was 1125 bags. Trading firms also distributed approximately 2000 bags themselves. In addition to Sichuan, there was also trade with local merchants and merchants from Zhejiang.</p>
<p>(Henan) Yesterday, a total of 16 or 17 shipments arrived from various sources (totaling over 3000 shi). The local market was sluggish. Only Qingdao merchants purchased over 600 bags. Therefore, market conditions continued to be weak. Prices for thick-grain early japonica rice and thin-grain rice only barely held steady for truly fresh goods. Medium-quality rice dropped nearly a jiao, and Du Yang jianyan dropped slightly. The price of Metasyn flat. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, 12 or 13 shipments arrived from various roads along the river. The market's demand for various goods remained sluggish. The price of white japonica rice continued to decline by several fen. The price of white Metasyn was stable, and the price of thin-grain rice was weak. Yangbu Hakka Xian, etc., were mostly steady, but sales remained weak. The prices of other goods were also weak.</p>
<h3>New Yellow Soybeans Strong Externally, Weak Internally</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market was subdued due to the closure of oil extraction plants, and sentiment was poor. Fortunately, local small mills were still purchasing beans, which helped to maintain the overall market. However, prices had been rising for several days, inevitably attracting a surge in supply. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the future trend of the market. Yesterday, approximately 1200 bags of Chengmentou beans were traded, 120 bags of Douchang beans were traded, and 100 bags of Poyang jiqing beans were traded. No other transactions were made. Factories purchased over 1000 bags of Haizhou old beans at a price of 5.07 yuan. Local traders traded 300 to 400 bags of yellow soybeans with sandy texture from Du at flat prices.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Shortage of Fine Cloth and Fine Twill Remains</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market saw a slight softening of sentiment among industry players due to the decline in yarn and cotton prices. However, market conditions remained very firm. The shortage of spot fine cloth and fine twill remained as difficult as ever. Sales of coarse cloth were sluggish, with demand from inland merchants being limited and sporadic. Market conditions were slightly looser. Tianjin merchants purchased approximately 50 to 60 pieces of 16-pound Double Fish coarse cloth, with prices dropping by 5 fen per piece. However, there was an extreme shortage of 9-pound innerwear coarse cloth, with spot prices requiring an additional 5 fen per piece compared to market prices. Sales of Yihuo Factory's light-weight coarse cloth and coarse twill were poor. Customers are still mainly loading goods based on previous orders. Merchants from Jiangxi are loading over 100 pieces of various factories' broadcloth, crepe, and Yihuo's coarse cloth, bleached cloth, and bleached twill. Merchants from Anhui are loading over 100 pieces of a large batch of raw-color twill, broadcloth, Zhigong, and white goods such as fine cloth, fine twill, and striped plain silk. Merchants from Changsha and Sichuan are loading goods the most actively, and they are urgently requesting the loading of printed velvet, Zhigong, blue cloth, and raw-color twill. Raw velvet and bleached velvet have also already been loaded. Su Lun Factory's raw-color velvet, 11-pound Shen, is priced at 7.45 yuan, and 11-pound Shenhu is priced at 7.25 yuan. This year, the factory's velvet cloth has opened higher than last year by approximately 1 yuan per piece.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: US Merchant Silk Trade Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the New York silk market was boosted by short covering, and the spot price of White Factory B-grade silk was 6 fen higher than last Saturday. Futures were up 5 fen. In addition, Japanese silk 83 and 75 evenness, Shanghai silk and Guangdong silk all rose by 2 fen. The price of Yokodai silk and futures also rose by 12 to 17 yuan. The Lyon silk market remained stable and unchanged, and silk transactions were still quiet. In Shanghai yesterday, the white factory silk market did not see much progress, but market sentiment slightly recovered. It is reported that some US merchant silk trades are still under negotiation. Further reports will be provided once the deals are formally concluded.</p>
<h3>Red and Green Tea Transactions Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, transactions for both red and green tea from foreign firms were sluggish. Only slightly over a hundred boxes of Keemun and Fule Road red tea were sold. However, the sales of Chinese tea in the British market are still good, and British tea merchants still plan to continue purchasing large quantities. As for the green tea market, there was no improvement. Dealers are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the rare green tea from ordinary firms. There are already 15,000 boxes stockpiled in the market. Both high-grade fine eyebrow green tea and Pingshui pearl tea are experiencing sluggish market conditions. Only the needle eyebrow category continues to be actively traded.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Tea Industry Association, fine eyebrow transactions remained sluggish yesterday, and all firms were taking a wait-and-see attitude. However, Xiehe purchased a small amount. The price of shrimp-eye tea was 70 to 90 yuan, the price of small needle eyebrow tea was 33 to 55 yuan, and the price of Tun extract was 113 to 116 yuan, with each category having 100 to 200 boxes purchased. Looking at the selling prices of various teas, they are slightly lower than before. It is reported that Jinlong and Yihe briefly discussed the issue with a large firm in Pingshui. Jinlong purchased over 700 pieces of top-grade toumi tea at a price of 63 to 64 yuan, and Xiehe also transacted 300 pieces at a price of 57 to 60 yuan. Looking at the market, the price of dyed pearl tea is firm, while the large firms are weak.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Zhī Yáng White and Shàntóu Reserves Reported Depleted</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw an upward trend as it was reported via air from Shàntóu that coarse granulated white sugar was selling for twenty-four yuan. The association set the price at twenty-four yuan for spot coarse granulated white sugar, while transit goods rose by ten cents. Old stock sold for six yuan and eighty cents, and new stock for six yuan and ninety cents. Transit goods of East White (J mark) sold for six yuan and seventy cents, TK mark for six yuan and fifty-five cents, and ET mark for six yuan and fifty cents, all with transactions. There were no other fluctuations. Due to the high prices of coarse white sugar from Cháo Prefecture, local white sugars like Zhī Yáng were sold locally and unavailable for procurement. Only a few thousand bags of green sugar remained, and over three thousand bags of red sugar, with firm production prices and no expectation of easing. As a result, the market in Shànghǎi became tighter. Numbered goods of green sugar were quoted at twelve yuan and fifty cents, and Huánggāng green sugar at twelve yuan, with a further four hundred bags opened. Mian red sugar was priced at fifteen yuan, twelve cents to fourteen yuan, eight cents, with over a hundred bags opened. Dealers from Guǎngdōng opened over a hundred bags of Huìzhōu red sugar at fourteen yuan, an increase of twenty cents. Huìzhōu foreign sugar was opened with seventy bags for fifteen yuan, six cents. Dealers from Jiàn Prefecture opened over two hundred bags of Sháo'ān white sugar at eighteen yuan, eight to five cents, an increase of thirty cents. Dealers from Xīnghuà opened Míngjīng red sugar at fourteen yuan, two cents, and Jīng red sugar at thirteen to twelve yuan, five cents, with over two hundred bags sold. Because Zhī Yáng had no stock, the number board wild call price was eighteen yuan, but no transaction was made.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Sìchuān Pickled Mustard Greens Open Up a Yuan Higher ——Tiānjīn Red Dates Are Last Year's Product——</h3>
<p>Sìchuān pickled mustard greens have seen increasingly active sales recently, with the resolution of the Guǎngdōng situation. Brands like Shàngpái Lèqì pickled mustard greens, Xù Yù Tōng and Hóng Lì Yuán, previously opened at twenty-three yuan, seven to eight cents, now are priced at twenty-five yuan, with limited stock available. Fúlíng pickled mustard greens, previously opened at nineteen yuan to eighteen yuan, five cents, have now been traded at twenty yuan to nineteen yuan for six to seven hundred batches. An inspection of the merchant goods stored in Shànghǎi reveals approximately ten thousand batches, and the market shows signs of continued tightening. Yesterday's trading board quoted high-grade Lèqì pickled mustard greens at twenty-two to twenty-three yuan and Fúlíng pickled mustard greens at seventeen to eighteen yuan. (The Tiānjīn news about new black dates reported yesterday stated that due to remaining old stock from the previous year, last year's dates were referred to as "new dates" and were not newly produced this year. This correction is provided to avoid misunderstandings.)</p>
<h3>Hardware: British Steel Plate Supply Cannot Meet Demand</h3>
<p>Since the overseas price of British steel plates began to rise, very few have been ordered by local businesses in this port. Therefore, current imports are not high. However, recently, the business of merchant groups and manufacturers has suddenly increased, and there is insufficient stock in the market to meet distribution needs. Fast-selling items, such as half-fen and seven-li plates, are in danger of running out of stock. Standard asking prices are being maintained due to positive market sentiment, awaiting favorable prices. Yesterday, over four hundred and eighty dan were sold, released by hardware stores along North Sūzhōu Road. The price was seven yuan, two and a half cents per dan for half-fen, six yuan and eighty cents for seven-li, six yuan and seventy cents for one-fen, and six yuan and five cents for plates over one and a half fen, which is approximately ten cents higher than previous board prices.</p>

<h3>Odds and Ends</h3>
<p>— (Zhou Liangchao)</p>
<p>A single lamp, small as a bean, in a humble room; its light is certainly faint, but it already possesses the function of providing utility to people. We only need to develop our abilities in ways that benefit society. We cannot say how great the effect will be, but I believe a comforting feeling in the heart can be reaped in abundance. Friends: do not despise the smallness of your own abilities. The spreading of lamplight is a symbol of vitality in each of our lives.</p>
<p>A small stick of ink; we should not underestimate that it has no great use. If we examine it closely, in terms of the progress of culture and the transmission of art, it is enough to be called a powerful force that "does not disgrace its mission." In this regard, we can learn a good lesson: that is, do not think that being utilized by others means being weak. People who are valuable and capable enough to be utilized by others are worthy of our praise and emulation.</p>
<p>The cicadas these days are exercising their authority to the full, their noisy chirping deafening, disturbing people's tranquility, and quite annoying. In reality, no benefit can be found in them. Why bother making such noise, inviting curses? A friend said to me: The cicadas' chirping is just a phenomenon during the scorching heat of summer and is not worth taking to heart. Moreover, their lifespan is so short. When summer ends and autumn comes, they will disappear without a trace.</p>
<h3>Numbers</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Numbers are merely used to indicate the quantity or amount of qualities, quantities, or other various things. For example, a lawsuit, two slaps, three cobblers, and the like; there is originally nothing much to say about them. However, since numbers indicate the quantity or amount of qualities or quantities, then for the sake of indicating the quantity or amount of qualities or quantities, it is natural that if one doesn't speak, then so be it, but if one does speak, one should speak accurate numbers. For example, to say, "That woman is only twenty-two or twenty-three years old," "That time was in June or July," "Yesterday's rain started at four or five o'clock," "That was an article of three or four thousand words." This type of consecutive use of two numbers together is truly somewhat perplexing.</p>
<p>In the past, when I was in my hometown, when people spoke of the distance of a journey, there was almost a fixed pattern. The most common were the distances of "three li," "six li," "nine li," "twelve li," "eighteen li," "twenty-four li," "thirty-six li," "forty-eight li," and "sixty li." Although in reality, the length of the journey was often inconsistent, when speaking of it, people would always say the closest round number of li. No one ever said, "From such-and-such place to such-and-such place is twenty-seven li" or "twenty-eight li." Therefore, we could often hear people say, "The thirty-six li from Place A to Place B is much farther than the thirty-six li from Place B to Place C." Even the same "thirty-six li" could be distinguished as near or far; it was truly an indescribably subtle way of speaking.</p>
<p>In recent years, the uses of numbers have become wider and wider every day. In addition to their original use as adjectives, they have gradually transformed into pronouns or nouns. For example, the house number of the Wang residence is number thirteen, so "number thirteen" has become a pronoun for the Wang residence. The given name of the female tea server Yang Aidi is not well-known, but "number seven" is known by everyone to be that waitress with the expressive eyes and eyebrows. Patrolmen, mail carriers, ticket sellers on streetcars, and so on all seem to be hiding their names. Such-and-such number is someone's real name, which is really interesting. Furthermore, the various sections and divisions in government offices are now also replaced with numbers. When speaking of them, it's always Section One, Section Two; it's extremely simple. And in factories, there are even the glorious titles of "Namo Wen" and "Namo Tuo" (pronounced "Na Me Wen" and "Na Me Tuo," meaning number one, that is, the foreman, and number two, the assistant foreman), representing their real names. However, in Shanghai, there are some numbers that are not used as numbers. Such as "not three not four," "seven don't match eight," "don't care three seven twenty-one," "stir seven think three," "mouth five tongue six," "board board sixty-four," "six chaos three thousand," "nonsense three thousand," "two eight five," and so on. Even the world's top mathematicians would have no way to explain the logic of these numbers. But these numbers are so familiar to everyone in Shanghai that they flow out of their mouths naturally. Strange numbers indeed.</p>
<h3>A Scene at the North Railway Station</h3>
<p>— Zhang Muliang</p>
<p>The North Railway Station seems to be perpetually showing a noisy and chaotic scene, as if adhering to a schedule. This scene will absolutely never be erased from our impressions.</p>
<p>"Dang! Dang!..." After a series of loud bell strikes, that monster of the twentieth century, having crouched on the tracks and roared until hoarse, has arrived. Tall, short, thin, fat…people of all different shapes and sizes emerge from the dark train compartments, stirring about. Goods large and small are likewise stirring about. The clamor of voices, the tense emotions, everything is filled with hurried activity. The very cells of the crowd seem to be trembling in this noisy and chaotic scene.</p>
<p>Originally, there was only a traffic police officer standing at the entrance, but now the situation is clearly different. The armed police have increased from one to ten or so.</p>
<p>People, one by one, in strings, wriggle their way out at the ticket collection point. The police take advantage of this time to check people's bulky luggage.</p>
<p>"Sir! Nanjing Hotel is good, oh?" "Sir! The East Asia Hotel is very clean." The hotel greeters are all rushing to drum up business.</p>
<p>The rickshaw pullers standing outside the iron fence, seeing this situation, feel as if the greatest hope has arrived. So they use their swift legs, rushing to the station entrance to snatch up everyone's business. However, the rickshaw pullers' fate of doing business is ultimately blocked by the police officers' batons.</p>
<p>"Dang! Dang!..." After another series of loud bell strikes, the radio in the station reports loudly and clearly, "The Beijing-Shanghai 1:20 express train is about to depart!" As a result, the station, which had been quiet for a moment, returns to its chaotic state.</p>
<p>The North Railway Station seems to be perpetually showing a noisy and chaotic scene, as if adhering to a schedule. This scene will absolutely never be erased from our impressions.</p>
<h3>When Drinking Water, Remember the Source</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Changing Phoenix</p>
<h3>Authored by Zhang Henshui</h3>
<p>Chapter 4: Sight and Hearing Are Not Fleeting, Doubt Turns to Letter; Life and Death Can Be Entrusted, Generously Sending a Lament</p>
<p>It was not far from the school; turning into a small alley, he bumped right into the girl he did not wish to see. Today she had changed into a white top, tied with a long green lake crepe skirt. A jasmine ball hung diagonally on her coat button. In her hand she carried a small umbrella, but did not open it. Judging by her appearance, she seemed quite natural. A person with worries of his own connects events, thinking that she hadn't been angry? Just as he was thinking this, she seemed to have a new thought. She suddenly stopped and stared at him. Guoqi himself did not know how to behave properly, and his eyelids kept drooping down, not daring to look at her directly. At this time, she stopped and looked over, so he absolutely could not ignore her. He couldn't help but smile at her. At this moment, he saw that she was showing an unprecedented attitude, and she gave Guoqi a deep nod. However, after nodding, she had no other expression, immediately raised her head, and walked straight away. Guoqi, when leaving the school gate, made up his mind to ignore her, and his mind was much clearer. Now, having encountered her again, and having received this unexpected treatment, he could not help but be happy. Once happy, he unknowingly re-entered the maze. So, he resumed his pre-departure attitude, tucked the sachet under his arm, lowered the brim of his felt hat a little, and took the first step towards home. He walked straight into the front door, then woke up a second time, realizing he could not continue to be lost in wild thoughts. Standing still for a moment, as if in front of a mirror, he deliberately put on a smile, then walked into the hall with his chest puffed out. In fact, after that one admonition, Madam Zhang guessed that Guoqi would no longer take the matter of writing battles to heart. At this time, he was resting in his bedroom. Guoqi saw that there was no one in the hall, and did not want to disturb his mother again, so he quietly walked back to his own room. He didn't understand why, but he felt particularly tired. He fell onto the rattan chair and didn't even want to turn over. He lay like this for about an hour or two and did not get up until it was time for dinner. Liu Ma came to invite him to dinner. He wanted to refuse, but he was afraid that his mother would suspect he was ill, so he had to stand up and tidy his clothes. And he was afraid that his face would show signs of illness, so he wiped his face twice with a wet towel before going to the hall. He saw that what was on the table was a bowl of tofu soup, a bowl of boiled bok choy, a bowl of stir-fried string beans with shredded pork, and two small crucian carp. (54)</p>
<p>Biographical Sketches</p>
<h3>The Life of Gorky (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Lin Liqin</p>
<p>In 1898, at the age of thirty, Gorky's first single-volume collection of short stories, "Makar Chudra," was published. In May of the same year, he was arrested for the second time and imprisoned in a fortress in the central part of the Outer Caucasus, charged with organizing criminal associations, conducting social democratic propaganda in workers' groups, and expressing dissatisfaction with the current system and government policies with the aim of overthrowing the imperial autocratic regime. However, he was soon acquitted without charges.</p>
<p>In 1900, he was arrested for the third time and exiled to the Alyaksamovsky district, accused of subsidizing insurgents. Later, with the assistance of Tolstoy and after an examination by seven doctors, it was proven that his lungs were unhealthy, and he was released.</p>
<p>In 1902, Gorky was elected as an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Sciences, but this recommendation aroused jealousy and opposition from a small number of aristocratic circles, who used the fact that Gorky had been accused of conducting revolutionary propaganda among workers and violating Article 1035 of the criminal law to revoke his qualification.</p>
<p>In 1903, at the age of thirty-five, "Gorky's Collected Works" in six volumes was published. In this year, Gorky bought a publishing house, published daily newspapers, and published many editorials advocating revolution, as well as many inexpensive popular literature readers.</p>
<p>In 1905, after the Russian Tsar massacred demonstrating crowds, Gorky was arrested again for drafting a "Declaration Attempting to Subvert the Existing Russian System," and as a result, he was exiled abroad.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1906, Gorky left Russia for the United States, where he gave speeches and held meetings to raise funds for the Russian revolutionary movement. He was forced to move to the island of Capri in Italy for a short stay. The following year, he went to England to attend the London Congress of the Social Democratic Party.</p>
<p>In 1908, Gorky organized a branch of the Social Democratic Party on the island of Capri in Italy and provided the party with most of his royalties. During this period, Gorky began corresponding with Lenin.</p>
<p>In 1914, during the tercentenary commemoration of the Romanov dynasty, Gorky had the opportunity to be pardoned and returned to Russia.</p>
<p>After the completion of the Russian October Revolution in 1917, Gorky devoted his best efforts and actively participated in the Soviet cultural construction.</p>
<p>In 1921, Gorky's old pulmonary tuberculosis illness relapsed, and he went to Sorrento, Italy, again to recuperate. The following year, he moved to Germany.</p>
<p>On March 19, 1928, Gorky's sixtieth birthday was celebrated. In the same year, it was also the thirty-fifth anniversary of Gorky's engagement in literary life. On this day, the entire Soviet Union held grand celebrations for him. In this month, Gorky returned to his country and was elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1931, Gorky rejoined the Bolshevik Party with the status of a formal party member.</p>
<p>In April 1932, in the year that the first Five-Year Plan of the Soviet Union was completed, on the eve of the start of the second Five-Year Plan, the All-Union Committee of Writers' Associations was established, and Gorky, with his reputation as a caregiver of proletarian literature, was elected as its honorary chairman.</p>
<p>In 1936, Gorky, at the age of sixty-seven, contracted the flu and died of illness on June 18 in a village near Moscow.</p>
<p>Looking at Gorky's life as a whole, the poverty of his early life and the spirit of his struggle with the environment in his middle age are truly admirable. And especially, he never received a day of systematic education and became a giant in the world of literature through self-study, how many people in history can compare!</p>
<p>Here, we want to talk about Gorky's literary tendencies. Regarding the exploration of this aspect, there is no need to say more. In a word, Gorky is a very progressive B-grade writer.</p>
<p>However, Gorky's early works tended towards romantic realism. Because he himself came from the lower classes, the characters in his novels were almost all rags and tatters. The original quality expressed by his core intention was to create a philosophy of transcending good and evil by deliberately portraying the rogue type with a strong will and passionate feelings due to the psychology of worshiping supermen and by satisfying the actions of destroying laws and social order. Such works include "Chelkash" and "Malva," etc. It was not until after 1898 that he changed this style.</p>
<p>Gorky's works can be roughly divided into five periods here:</p>
<p>The first period was from 1892 to 1898. This was the period when he created short stories, that is, the initial era of his tendency towards romance and realism.</p>
<p>The second period was from 1899 to 1906. This was the period when he wrote novels and plays about social issues. Important works during this period include the novel "Foma Gordeyev," "Three Men," and the plays "The Petty Bourgeoisie," "The Lower Depths," etc. During this period, Gorky founded a daily newspaper and wrote many editorials advocating revolution.</p>
<p>The third period was from 1907 to 1909. This was the period when he began to write novels depicting class struggles. The main works during this period include the play "Enemies" and the novel "Mother," etc.</p>
<p>The fourth period was from 1910 to 1912. This was the literary period when he bravely devoted himself to the revolutionary tide. During this period, he ruthlessly criticized the decline of the petty bourgeoisie and clearly supported the growth of the proletariat. The main works include the novella "Okurov City" and the novel "Matvei Kozhemyakin," etc.</p>
<p>The fifth period was from 1912 to the end of his last breath. During this long period, in addition to completing his great epic, "The Forties," it can be said that this was the period when he wrote autobiographies and memoirs. Works on autobiographies include "My Childhood" and "My Universities." Texts on memoirs include "Reminiscences of Andreyev" and "Reminiscences of Korolenko"—Korolenko was an early progressive writer in Russia. Gorky's rise to the literary world was greatly assisted by him—and other works. In addition, there is the play "Yegor Bulychov," etc.</p>
<p>Speaking of the origin of Gorky's literary success, this is due to his fundamental denial of metaphysics and theoretical propositions: he believes that the statement "When the cannon fires, the muse is silent" is extremely erroneous. Therefore, he resolutely threw two bombs into the garden of literature with his poems praising brave madness: "The Song of the Falcon" and "The Song of the Stormy Petrel," demanding that the storm come more forcefully. This was proven after the Russian October Revolution, and Gorky's literary success of course has his valuable arguments and viewpoints.</p>
<p>The great Gorky, whom we admire and serve, has left this world. This is the greatest misfortune of the world literary scene and an irreparable loss! I said this at the beginning. However, death is the inevitable end of life, and the phrase "eternal life" is as vague in the philosophy of life as "God." We can only push to the point of "the dead are already dead," put away our sadness for Gorky, and look forward to the new Gorky coming to this world!</p>

<p>Night Scene of Shanghai</p>
<h3>Human Flesh Market</h3>
<p>— Li Yong</p>
<p>How mysterious the night is! Especially the night in Shanghai, which is full of tempting colors, and the ladies are so intoxicated by it that they are dazzled. The night is indeed a mysterious thing, so all the mysterious deeds are also unfolded one by one at night. But look at the three things of smoking, gambling, and prostitution, all of which have to take advantage of this night to move around. Especially prostitutes, who almost regard this as their entire active time, so the hotels that are unanimously recognized by people as trading human flesh markets are very prosperous all night long.</p>
<p>With ironclad facts in front of us, if we want to carefully appreciate the night scene of this human flesh market, we might as well go to the various hotels to take a tour when the lights are first lit, and we can see all kinds of prostitutes dressed up in flamboyant dresses moving around in each hall. The tea servers in the halls are the brokers for the market transactions. Under the efforts of the brokers, at least a few in each hotel are successfully traded. Therefore, prostitutes occupy a particularly important position in the Shanghai night scene. Although the municipal authorities believe that prostitutes are the most dangerous things, the disease-related agencies are actively cracking down on them. However, prostitutes have an incredible magic power, and the youth who are attracted by them still try it as if they are drunk. Therefore, the transmission of gonorrhea is especially easy. Wasting money and experiencing pain, your illness is still increasing rather than decreasing. Just imagine, a fallen youth, being misled by prostitutes and injured by inferior drugs, under these two heavy attacks, the suffering they suffer is not difficult to imagine. Shi Yuequan is one of the victims, and he suffers from very severe gonorrhea. He has taken almost seven or eight kinds of gonorrhea medicine, but none of them have worked at all. It was not until recently that he went to Wing On Company to buy "Anti-Gonorrhea," which is made of a combination of yellow pigment and Vak Tsui, that he escaped from the tiger's mouth. Readers, you must be careful! The Shanghai night scene is a trap, and the counterfeit drugs on the market are your shackles!</p>
<h3>Clinical Case Examples</h3>
<p>— Recorded by Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine, University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>(1) Acute Gonorrhea</p>
<p>The patient is a shop assistant named Lin, from Shuanglin, Zhejiang, currently thirty years old. (Chief complaint) - Having sex with a prostitute, suffering from gonorrhea for nearly two weeks, still in the acute phase. Suffering greatly, dripping when urinating, feeling extremely strong stabbing pain, and abnormally burning. (Medical history) - Mr. Lin, on a certain night last month, was strolling and cooling off on the road, was seduced by a prostitute, and contracted gonorrhea, and came to me for treatment immediately. (Treatment) - I often prescribe medicine according to the symptoms, so I took the internal medicine "Anti-Gonorrhea" made of yellow pigment and Vak Tsui. It is said that "Anti-Gonorrhea" is especially effective for the treatment of acute gonorrhea, so Mr. Lin's gonorrhea was cured after taking only three bottles, which can be said to be a fortunate person.</p>
<p>(2) Weakness and Smoking Cessation</p>
<p>The patient is a female, 56 years old. Her husband operated a silk factory in the 10th year of the Republic of China (1921). At that time, the export price of silk was very high, so he accumulated a lot of wealth. Due to weakness, she mistakenly smoked cigarettes to invigorate herself, which caused her to become deeply addicted to smoking, and she also suffers from stomach pain, which is difficult to quit. (Chief complaint) - Stomach pain attacks, wanting to faint, smoking addiction is difficult to quit, insomnia and restlessness. (Medical history) - She had suffered from stomach pain in middle age, so she smoked to relieve it, which led to addiction. The pain is still there. This spring, she was introduced by Mr. Xu, who had successfully quit smoking safely at my place, to be treated (Treatment) - I instructed her to go to the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company to buy and take "Stomach Pain Relief" to treat her stomach disease, and then use the reproductive smoking cessation holy medicine "Reproduction Element" to remove her smoking addiction. In order to quickly seek to break her addiction, she was injected with "Yu Wei Ci Life-Saving." With such a three-pronged approach, in less than two months, the weakness was gone, and the stomach pain and smoking addiction were safely removed.</p>
<h3>Fundamental Strategies for Strengthening the Stomach</h3>
<p>— Physician Wang Shiying</p>
<p>If people feel that their digestive power is weakening, various parts of the body will also feel uncomfortable, and even develop morbidity. Therefore, we must not be too indifferent to the hygiene of the digestive system. Man is like a machine, food is the fuel of the machine, and the stomach is the furnace that holds the coal essence. Once the furnace has a problem, it will naturally affect the starting of the machine. Then, when the stomach has diseases, the health of the body will also have problems. Therefore, if there is a situation of gastric sluggishness and weakness and loss of appetite, the first step is to quickly buy and take the organ preparation "Stomach Strengthening Element," which can enhance digestive power and help your blood circulation. From then on, you will not only be physically strong, but also have a ruddy complexion and sufficient energy. This is the fundamental strategy for strengthening the stomach. If you suffer from stomach pain, you should also take "Stomach Pain Relief" to eradicate the cause of the pain, and its effect is very effective. It is truly a medicine that cures the disease.</p>
<h3>Painful Memories</h3>
<p>— Sick Man</p>
<p>"Poor people shouldn't get sick, it's like Jiaotong University is lucky." These two popular sayings have very implicitly revealed the suffering of poor people getting sick.</p>
<p>Because I am poor, and my lust is high, every time after sexual impulses, I have to rely on both hands to restrain it, and as a result, I contracted very severe spermatorrhea." Moreover, this bad habit of self-pollution is somewhat mysterious, and even impossible to get rid of. Therefore, I suffered from very heavy neurasthenia and had no energy to engage in business. Unexpectedly, I am poor again, and the spermatorrhea medicine that I repeatedly borrowed money to buy just made fun of me, a poor boy, with no effect at all, and made my illness worse every day. Just imagine, poor people are already suffering terribly when they get sick, how can they bear the heavy exploitation of inferior medicines? The suffering they suffer is even deepened! After I have tasted the deception of inferior drugs, the loss of money and energy is unbearable. It was not until early March of this year that, with the introduction of a friend, I went to Taihe Pharmacy to buy and take "Shimi Tuo's Sperm-Consolidating Pills" to cure the spermatorrhea, and at the same time took the tonic holy medicine "Reproduction Element" to gradually cure all neurasthenia diseases. Now I have broken free from the entanglement of the disease demon. This painful experience is worth remembering!</p>

<h3>Treatment for Gout and Bone Pain</h3>
<p>— Jia Zhizhong, Voice Teacher</p>
<p>Bone and joint pain, while having different sources such as latent wind-dampness or residual toxins, often affect patients with weakened kidneys. This impairs their urine filtration, leading to unclean blood and excessive uric acid. This uric acid forms crystals like shards of glass that cause bone pain when they enter bones, muscle spasms when they enter tendons, muscle soreness when they enter muscles, and numbness when they enter limbs. This can range from minor numbness and insensitivity in the hands and feet, as if shackled, to severe cases of paralysis affecting the entire body, leaving the patient crippled.</p>
<p>Therefore, oral administration of "Strong Deng's Bone Pain Tablets" is most effective for bone pain. This product addresses the root cause of the illness and is proven effective, especially well-suited for the constitutions of Chinese people. I have used it repeatedly to successfully treat Mr. Fang's numbness in the limbs, Mr. Qiu's bone pain and muscle spasms, and Mr. She Jianmin's long-term paralysis. All recovered within two months, escaping the torment of illness. "Strong Deng's Bone Pain Tablets" truly earn the trust of patients and the endorsement of doctors due to their efficacy.</p>
<p>Hemiplegia</p>
<p>For several years, I have suffered from bone and joint pain. Although I have taken medicine for treatment, I have not found any adequately effective drugs. Consequently, the illness has persisted. Last winter, it worsened, even to the point that the bones and joints on the left side of my body are unable to move. It worsens especially during seasonal changes. I earnestly request instructions for treatment. (Chen Yannong)</p>
<p>(Answer) You can purchase and take "Strong Deng's Bone Pain Tablets" from the Sino-British Dispensary, which may cure you.</p>
<p>What to do about Leukorrhea</p>
<p>Sir: I suffer greatly from leukorrhea. Washing my clothes daily is already overwhelming. Moreover, it has a strong, pungent odor. I have heard that leukorrhea is a disease and detrimental to health. Therefore, I especially describe the symptoms of my illness and respectfully request that you quickly provide a treatment method. (Sincerely asked by Sanyuan)</p>
<p>(Answer) Please use "Leukorrhea Cure" externally, which can cure the leukorrhea at its root. It is available at Huamei Pharmacy.</p>

<p>(1) Excessive Sexual Desire and Mental Exhaustion</p>
<p>Patient Shen Shibai, 32 years old, from Xiadian Town, Zhenjiang, in the business profession. (Chief complaint) - Excessive sexual desire, declining energy. (Medical History) - Mr. Shen's family owns thousands of acres of fertile land and is wealthy. As the only son to carry on the family line, he was inevitably spoiled and married early. After a year without conceiving, he took a concubine, resulting in excessive indulgence in carnal desires, leading to emaciation and weakness, with no share in good health. He suffers from premature ejaculation, impotence, lower back pain, tremors, cold limbs, heart palpitations, night sweats, and a sallow complexion. Last autumn, he came to Shanghai specifically for medical treatment and consulted me. Upon examination, I found that Mr. Shen's illness was caused by a deficiency of endocrine secretions from the reproductive glands. In addition to the latest type of electrotherapy, I instructed him to purchase "Spermin," made from extracts of reproductive glands, from the Western medicine department of Wing On Company to restore the lost function of his reproductive glands. After three months, all signs of decline disappeared, and he became strong and healthy. This summer, Mr. Shen came to Shanghai to get more medicine. According to him, his wife is already five months pregnant.</p>
<p>(2) A Glimpse of Medication for Curing Nocturnal Emission</p>
<p>Patient Yu Yongming, currently 24 years old, from Changzhou, Jiangsu, works at a department store. (Chief Complaint) - Frequent nocturnal emissions, exhaustion of essence. (Medical History) - Mr. Yu engaged in masturbation during his early development, relying on his robust health without any remorse. Over time, due to essence depletion and physical weakness, he became mentally lethargic and began to regret it. However, he already suffered from nocturnal emissions and insomnia, with various ailments occurring together. Repeatedly taking tonics had little effect, and the frequency of nocturnal emissions increased, causing his physical strength to decline further. (Treatment) - I treated him with a method that addresses both the root cause and the symptoms. First, I used "Hemitol's Essence-Consolidating Tablets" to treat his nocturnal emissions. Once the essence gate was secured, the nocturnal emissions subsided. Then, I used "Spermin," a preparation of reproductive gland extract, to restore his vitality. As a result, the illness disappeared without a trace. After taking it for about a month, his muscles became fuller, his weight increased, his mind became clear, and he was able to sleep soundly at night.</p>

<p>(1) The Story of a Cured Patient of Premature Aging</p>
<p>(2) Lessons on Women's Diseases: Strengthening the Uterus and Regulating Menstruation</p>
<p>(3) Record of a Successful Smoke Addiction Quit</p>
<p>(1) Premature aging refers to being in a state of aging in appearance and body before reaching old age.</p>
<p>Patients with this condition may suffer from weak endowments, harm from masturbation, excessive labor, or imbalances after illness. The endocrine secretion of the reproductive glands suddenly feels deficient, and the body loses its regulating and nourishing functions, leading to blood depletion, mental decline, essence thinning, and muscle wasting, resulting in lower back pain, hunchback, sallow complexion, and advanced years. Therefore, administering reproductive gland extract preparations is essential.</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Sun, 32 years old, suffered from physical decline and mental lethargy due to poor nutrition and inadequate care, resulting in premature aging. Not only did he experience tremors, cold limbs, and lower back pain, but he also feared labor and annoyance, suffering from insomnia and forgetfulness. He appeared to be in his forties. This spring, he came to me for treatment. I instructed him to purchase and take "Spermin" from the Sino-French Pharmacy. His reproductive glands were revived, his body became strong and healthy, his blood was abundant, his spirit was sufficient, and he regained the youthful state of his 26 or 27-year-old days. He left gratefully.</p>
<p>(2) Among women's diseases, irregular menstruation and leukorrhea are the most common, followed by breast atrophy, abdominal pain, and miscarriage. The origin of these diseases lies in the weakness of the reproductive glands. Therefore, the best way to treat the symptoms is to nourish the reproductive glands.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bai Zhengming came to me complaining of menstrual pain, irregular periods (sometimes early, sometimes late, sometimes heavy, sometimes light), and uterine cold during menstruation. Prolonged neglect led to persistent red and white leukorrhea, breast atrophy, and physical weakness. I instructed her to purchase and take "Female Spermin" from the Sino-British Pharmacy to strengthen the uterus and regulate menstruation, and to use "Leukorrhea Cure" externally to reduce inflammation and treat leukorrhea. Within a month, she was cured and regained the youth and beauty of a young woman, with breast development far exceeding the withered state she was in when she first came for consultation.</p>
<p>(3) More than half of the cases of smoke addiction are due to smoking to relieve stomach pain. If the stomach pain is not treated at its root, the pain will persist, making it difficult to quit smoking completely.</p>
<p>I have helped many people quit smoking. For those who became addicted to smoking due to stomach pain, I always treat their stomach pain first. This makes quitting smoking safe and pleasant, and the smoke addiction is quickly eliminated.</p>
<p>Last winter, Mr. Xu Mengmei came to me seeking help to quit smoking. He said that he had been suffering from stomach pain for over ten years. I instructed him to purchase and take "Stomach Pain Cure" from Wing On Company to treat the root of his illness, and "Stomach Strengthening Element" to strengthen his ailing stomach. Once the stomach pain was cured, I used "Spermin" to remove his smoking toxins and break his smoke addiction. Within a month, he safely quit smoking.</p>

<h3>The Spanish Unrest</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Spanish women are world-renowned for their beauty, but few know that their people are in dire straits. The revolutionary tide has been very strong in recent years. Spain was originally a kingdom. In the 1931 revolution, the emperor was overthrown and a republic was established. However, their landlord forces were very powerful. Therefore, although the throne representing the interests of the landlords was overthrown, the landlord forces still existed. In recent years, they have stood in two sharp opposing camps with the revolutionary forces. This unrest is still the work of the old forces. According to a dispatch from the National News Agency in Paris on the 24th, the deposed King Alfonso of Spain told reporters from the Paris Evening News today that he did not want to return to the country immediately, and said that if the leftist government continued to cling to power, this revolution (!) would never end. He deeply wished that Spain would get rid of terror and slaughter (?) Only the failure of the leftist government could end the civil war and bring peace to Spain (!) This revolution is purely a national movement (!) that is, the joint active action of royalists and right-wing republicans to overthrow the leftist government. The deposed emperor's remarks could not have made the content of the Spanish unrest clearer.</p>
<p>In addition, according to a dispatch from Havas News Agency in Madrid on the same day, the government recently issued a radio broadcast stating that the money used by the rebels was provided by the financier March, who is a well-known Spanish banker. When the restorationist leader General Sanjurjo launched an uprising in 1932, he secretly provided funds, which led to him being sentenced to imprisonment. He then found a way to escape and lived abroad. From all aspects, we can see how landlords, bankers, the deposed emperor representing the landlords, and imperialists have, in fact, formed a united front, each doing their best to severely suppress the revolutionary wave that Spain has seen in recent centuries. This example has been demonstrated too much and too thoroughly in the past and present history. Looking at it today, we feel particularly close and insightful! The various wounds we have suffered, in the context of the fierce struggle between revolution and counter-revolution in Spain, are truly worth stroking and receiving some new lessons.</p>
<p>In a corner of Southern Europe, the beacon of moving from the old society to the new society has been burning brightly since the beginning of this century. In the Far East continent, China is also staging a state of unease caused by being trampled on by imperialists. Do not neglect our current position and strength. In the rapidly changing history of the world, we are shouldering the most important responsibilities and missions.</p>
<h3>A Kind Woman</h3>
<p>— Menghua</p>
<p>It was dusk, and it was raining lightly. I was walking alone with an umbrella, feeling lost. After turning a small alley, a familiar house appeared before my eyes.</p>
<p>Seeing this house, for some reason, my heart suddenly tightened. I took gentle steps, as if afraid of disturbing someone, and my heart beat rapidly. I carefully observed every passerby in front and behind, and they were all shrinking as they walked, which made me feel a little relieved. So I knocked on the door with my trembling palm.</p>
<p>I was afraid that a stranger would come out. What would I say then? And what if she already had guests? These questions swirled in my mind. But I didn't want to leave. I knocked on the door again.</p>
<p>Someone answered from inside! My God, it better be her. But the door felt as distant as a mountain, and I couldn't hear clearly if the voice inside was her. I almost wanted to slip away, but just then the door creaked open. It was her, no doubt, it was her. So I didn't dare to even look her in the face and, like someone who had just recovered from a serious illness, weakly lifted my right foot and crossed the threshold.</p>
<p>"I was just about to go out!" My mind gradually calmed down. I raised my head and looked at her. She was waiting for my reply, and her eyes were like fire, burning me all over.</p>
<p>"You didn't expect me to come, did you?" I said, my voice trembling.</p>
<p>She nodded and poured me a cup of tea. So we sat face to face.</p>
<p>Seeing her, I was once again immersed in the ocean of memories. I remembered it was also a rainy night, and it was already late. I was walking alone, running home along that mysterious street. Suddenly, a ghost-like figure came over and asked me in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Come to my house and have some fun!"</p>
<p>I looked at her in surprise. In the dim light, I saw two strings of tears glistening on her pale cheeks. I was stunned. Just then, she came closer and took my hand.</p>
<p>"Have pity on me, I: I..." She seemed unable to say anything more. So I didn't even reply and walked with her into this house where I was now sitting.</p>
<p>I saw a woman whose body had been defiled but who had a kind soul. This woman was her. She had brought me something mysterious. She was like a riddle, a knot that would never be untied. So tonight, I had come back here again with a sense of danger.</p>
<p>She was so reluctant to speak! Even a sentence seemed to require a long period of thought. Sitting in front of me was the Sphinx, I felt.</p>
<p>"Is your illness a little better?" I remembered what she had told me last time and asked her like that.</p>
<p>She shook her head. I saw her panting slightly, her hands pressing against her heaving chest, but she couldn't cough. "I don't fall asleep until one or two o'clock every night, and I can't sleep well... Alas, is there any hope for it to get better?" Like a lullaby sung by a mother holding her dead child, the trembling voice sounded mournfully.</p>
<p>I ran over and put my hand on her shoulder. I felt an awkward temptation, but it was pure. But she suddenly shook my hand off, turned her head, and said:</p>
<p>"Why did you come again? If I had known you were this kind of person, I would have regretted treating you wrongly that night... This is not a place for you to come, brother..."</p>
<p>It seemed that only crying could express the pain in her heart, and a series of tears streamed down. Under the lamplight, the tear-filled eyes flickered like the lake water under the slanting rays of the setting sun, so desolate.</p>
<p>I hugged her tightly and completely fainted.</p>
<p>"If I had a relative... just one, then I would..." she sobbed. "But all the people I meet every day are beasts, pigs, and dogs. They treat me so cruelly..." She raised her head and asked me with a prayerful expression: "People say there is no mountain that cannot be crossed in this world. Is that true? When will I be able to cross this mountain? Haven't I suffered enough yet? I'm really tired, but I still have to drag myself down, and will it only be over when I die? Tell me! Tell me!" She shook my shoulders hard. "Why don't you say anything? You!"</p>
<p>I saw the flames of hope burning fiercely in her heart. But all of life was constantly pouring water on it. Wasn't life already weariness and loathing to her?</p>
<p>The night was getting deeper, and the four walls were triumphantly raising the sound of mahjong, the noise, and the lewd laughter. My whole body was as uncomfortable as if it was being pricked by needles. We were all in the desert, feeling an indescribable loneliness.</p>
<p>We could only sit, sit, timidly and piously waiting for dawn.</p>
<h3>Physiognomy of a Camel</h3>
<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>In order to save expenses, I moved into a large compound. At first, I wasn't used to it, but gradually, I got used to it.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the sun was blocked by the western gable, and the alley was a bit shady. "What a great opportunity!" The belief jumped into everyone's heart. The elder sister-in-law from the back building, the aunt from the front building, and all sorts of people rushed out of their cages. The clothes were also quite grand. Sitting, standing, talking, laughing, all were indulged in naturally, without any restraint.</p>
<p>Two women walked in at the entrance. Judging by appearance, they were both over forty years old. Their feet were bound, and they walked a bit crookedly. The black leather bags looked quite heavy.</p>
<p>"We do physiognomy, all kinds of physiognomy." She swept her eyes over everyone, "even camel physiognomy."</p>
<p>Many eyes were fixed on her face, body, and feet. The older sister from next door added jokingly:</p>
<p>"How much for one physiognomy reading?"</p>
<p>"One dollar for a detailed reading, 150 copper coins for a regular reading."</p>
<p>"150 copper coins isn't much. Just read it once, and we'll talk later." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Lotus</h3>
<p>— Liao Chuxiu</p>
<p>I have already forgotten the Indian transliteration of the word "lotus." I used to know it. This flower is probably very common in India and is also highly valued. Shakyamuni sat on a lotus throne, and people in Zen Buddhism even used the number of layers on the lotus throne to distinguish the levels of hierarchy. In addition, the famous classic "The Lotus Sutra" explains that human beings are originally born in the mud, but they can bloom clean flowers.</p>
<p>As for my love for the lotus, I have already mentioned it in the previous article: the first reason is because its petals can be</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>fried in flour and eaten. Later, after reading a little more miscellaneous books, I learned that tea leaves can be wrapped in thin silk, placed in newly opened lotus flowers overnight, and then taken out to brew and drink the next day, which has a special fragrance. I tried it occasionally, and it was indeed very good, but drinking it often is just so-so.</p>
<p>There are too many writings about lotus in old Chinese poems and lyrics, but Western literature mostly writes about water lilies. Water lilies are slightly less common than lotuses, and white ones are more common. Now, thanks to trade, they can also be seen in China.</p>
<p>It is best to plant lotuses naturally in a pond. Those planted in tanks are not very easy to grow big, and some Chinese people even plant them in small pots, with leaves the size of a palm and flowers the size of a wine glass, called pot lotuses. It is said that this kind of pot lotus is still grown from ordinary lotus seeds, but using a special method.</p>
<p>There is a kind of giant lotus in India that is almost four or five times larger than the Chinese lotus. Small children a few months old can sit in the open flower. This is probably not just a legend!</p>
<p>The Southern Dynasties' "Midnight Songs" and "Wu Songs" are a unique highlight in Chinese literature. These short poems about lotus are very good, but those passionate men and women do not have a special love for lotus flowers, but because the word "lian" (蓮) in "lotus" has the same sound as the "lian" (憐) in "ailian" (愛憐), meaning "cherish," taking its double meaning. "Midnight Songs" and "Wu Songs" are all folk songs. This situation can also be seen in later folk songs. The famous line "When lotus flowers wither, lotus seeds are seen" still cannot but move people deeply when read today. As for "Splitting open the lotus seed reveals much bitterness," it is even more poignant!</p>
<p>It's summer now, and it's the season when lotus flowers are in full bloom. I don't know where there are many lotus flowers blooming in Shanghai. "Leaving behind the withered lotus to listen to the sound of rain," I probably can only go somewhere to listen to the sound of rain on the withered lotus when the autumn rain is continuous.</p>
<p>Correction: There were quite a few errors in the article "A Visit to the Shanghai Frog Farm" published yesterday. For example, each frog can produce 10,000 eggs, and at least 8,000 to 9,000 of these 10,000 eggs can hatch into new frogs. The word "thousand" was omitted. A small difference makes a great error. After the author sent a letter pointing out the errors, we are correcting them immediately and apologize for the errors.</p>

<p>Opening: "Dream of the Red Chamber Tune" (Part 1)</p>
<p>In the first month, plum blossoms bloom, a sprig cut short. Offering new year blessings with pepper flowers, wishing for a prosperous spring. Who can rival the Rong mansion in opening its banquets? Silver candles cast a cold light on the painted screens. Lantern Festival night. Enjoying flower lanterns. The whole world celebrates peace and prosperity. Cleverly, Mandarin Duck designs a domino game. Arousing poets to speak of it to this day. Intoxicated by the east wind, the second month is long. Fragrant blossoms abound in Yingchun's chamber. Beautiful women in the deep courtyard idly play the grass-fighting game. Daubing new rouge on the Shanghai crabapple. Green ornaments adorn their heads. Hands full of wild berries. The spring scenery of the spiritual terrace is unparalleled. A myriad of colors worthy of being painted. The poet hesitates, struggling to compose a review. In the third month of Wuling, the small peach turns red. But where can TanChun be found fishing duckweed? The warm sun melts, the fragrant grass is green. Artemisia supports me as I cross the bridge to the east. Swallows dart. Butterflies accompany bees. Jade branches intertwine, their shadows exquisite. The fragrance of flowers warms the painting. The willow breeze is not cold on the face. In the fourth month, the flowers wither, melancholy as she leans on the railing. When will Xichun return? Fallen petals cover the ground, no one sweeping. The three paths are covered in white felt with drifting catkins. The wind whispers softly. The sun shines brightly. A long painting, like a year, a partridge sky. Sitting alone, embracing the zither, singing a tune. Stealing half a day of leisure from a busy life. In the fifth month, pomegranate blossoms scatter their remaining glow. Xifeng arrives, adorned in colorful clouds. Her innate beauty is unmatched. The sour plums leave a lingering taste on the teeth. Her talent surpasses the crowd. Her beauty is worthy of praise. One branch of spring occupies ten parts of glory. The jade bracelet rings, lamenting the plain wrist. The plantain leaf is split and written on the gauze window. In the sixth month, listless, too lazy to paint her eyebrows. A silk fan brushes her face, carried in her hand. Dense shade, green trees, the sound of cicadas buzzing. The mountain colors are hazy, and the rain is also strange. Newly bathed. The evening breeze is gentle. Where the pearl curtains are rolled up, the setting sun descends. By the swamp, Xiangling has planted flowers all around. A pool of clearness can intoxicate the poetic spleen.</p>

<p>Opening: A Dream of Red Mansions - Classical Allusions (Part 2)</p>
<p>In the seventh month, the golden phoenix ascends the small tower. Lightly touching her brow, Daiyu's face is filled with sorrow. Gazing at her hometown, where is it? White clouds and red leaves, endlessly. Xiaoxiang Pavilion. Tears secretly stolen. Grieving, resentments accumulate, the ox of resentment. Crying cuckoos break the third watch moon. Going south, coming north, rest and rest again. In the eighth month, the fragrance of osmanthus drifts through the sky. Xiangyun emerges from East Mountain, wearing the moon. The sound of a mallet urging thought across the fence. The Milky Way is silent, turning jade sounds. The heavens are pure. Her eyebrows are cold. Hundred-foot tall building, a person leans on the couch. Watching the paulownia leaves gradually falling in the courtyard. The first hearing is disgusting, already without cicadas. On the ninth day, chrysanthemums bloom fresh beside the fence. Light makeup congeals, jade-like and divine. Not competing with the begonia for a smiling face. Content with a bamboo cage and thatched hut. Lonely and aloof, few understanding souls. Sitting in a precarious position, idly studying the Golden Script. Even more, Siqi is her companion. Unaffected by a speck of dust. In the tenth month of early winter, red flowers are picked. Shi Qin's elegance is unmatched in the world. Her appearance, like clouds and jade, enhances each other. Together with plum blossoms, they make up ten parts of spring. Poetry accompanies her. Brocade is her heart. The person is on the first floor of the precious platform. Amber cups pour out rose-colored clouds. South Mountain is clearly visible through the door. In the eleventh month, the sky is cold, the wind enters the pine. Xiuyan shrouds the snow-covered wind. A beautiful woman heats deer jerky in a warm pavilion. The bamboo stove boils, the fire is newly red. Contending to chant lines. Displaying skillful words. Tipping cups, enjoying pleasurable events, a delightful heart. Sunny skies and ten thousand miles, warm light shines. Following after, there will be plum blossoms, different from before. In the twelfth month, snow presses a branch of flowers. Baochai cleverly arranges it by her hair. Plum blossoms compete with the beautiful woman for elegance and simplicity. Ponder over the faint and light makeup. Silk gauze is still. Jade, yet great. A person's delicate state is truly worthy of praise. Even more, colorful clouds reflect the shadows. Deep, the water is shallow, and the reeds separate the sand. In the Pass, the moon is dull, intoxicated by the flower shadows. The treasure jade is hidden within, it is spring throughout the year. How many extravagant sons of noble families. Only the creeping plant leans towards the sun. Thousand-day red. Evergreen. In the gauze window, bamboo is tied to deceive. The jade box has not yet been opened, the Wu hook sword. Must obtain the goodness of Peach Blossom Spring to return.</p>

<p>Yuan Chang (1120) Midnight 11:45 PM to 1:30 AM</p>
<p>Opening: "He Lina" (Mimi, magazine issue number)</p>
<p>Spring Brightness has always been the most prosperous. It's a pity that that generation's extravagance and depravity knew no bounds. Now, singing houses and palaces are but relics. Heroic sons and daughters are swept away by the waves of time. Let's talk about a glamorous government official's daughter, fluttering in the wind. She is a modern and fresh social butterfly. Her manners are incomparably luxurious. A bright pearl in her palm, without discrimination. Let me tell you more about Miss Guan, with her modern thoughts. She is indeed better than those extravagant young masters who spend a fortune at every turn. Therefore, she is called the "lone hip" in the dance floor. She loves only her charming and beautiful posture, speaking and laughing in the wind. She pities only her slender waist, held in the silver lamplight as she dances. Mrs. Tao is originally a good friend from her maiden days. One night, she wholeheartedly recommended her cousin from Hangzhou. How laughable. That cousin. Asks a word. Speaks a few. Sometimes nods, sometimes hides. His cheeks are flushed red, like a crimson cloud. How regrettable that she places so much hope in her heart. Often calls the Tao family. Restaurants and cinemas. Music and more. They often go on leisurely trips, riding that motorcycle. One is a blooming hyacinth. The other is a married woman with a beautiful scenery. Don't say that his heart is as clear as water, without any stains. It's hard to know his prior warning. Leaking flowers. How laughable, that romantic Miss He. She suffered setbacks in love and went to the ends of the earth. Fan's family in the injured passenger shop was worried sick. Fortunately, she encountered the ancient lover of Master Guan. Later, the bright moon was in the sky, the wind and clouds were calm. The West Mountain villa has a unique pair of camphor trees. The long story of love between children is written off with one stroke.</p>

<h3>News Snippets from "Mr. Wang's Knight Errant Biography"</h3>
<p>Tang Jie, the actor who plays "Mr. Wang," said, "Mr. Wang's Knight Errant Biography" is indeed more interesting than the previous "Mr. Wang" films, and there are many more jokes, and every joke is not nonsensical!</p>
<p>Cao Xuesong, "Little Chen," listened to Xian Xinghai directing the collection of the "Mr. Wang's Knight Errant Biography" theme song "Song of a Casual Laborer" record at the Pathé Company the other day and was greatly moved. He said: Listening to Mr. Xian's music, it's as if I'm right there on the pier, personally hearing those dockworkers who work like oxen and horses humming and heaving as they transport goods. I was moved, I was greatly moved, I have never heard such great music!</p>
<p>Director Zuo Ming not only responsibly guides the leading actors in their acting, but even if the extras are not good and don't know how to act, it will definitely affect the entire film.</p>
<p>Li Lin, "Little A Yuan," has fewer scenes in "Mr. Wang's Knight Errant Biography," but she works very hard, so the results are not bad!</p>

<h3>Another Opera Troupe, Xi Cailian, to Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Performing at the Great New World Amusement Park soon</p>
<p>Since the Great New World Amusement Park has been contracted by Mr. Zhang Ting and others, whether it is Peking opera, new dramas, or local comedy, they have hired first-class talents, such as Zhi Wangshao Lai, Liu Chunshan, Little Female Du, and Zhang Dagong. The cinema has been equipped with Western electrical machinery, and the selection of films is strict. Only those that have not been shown in the amusement park or second-run cinemas are chosen, and they follow the needs of tourists and audiences. This is especially commendable. Mr. Xu Xiongkuan is in charge of general affairs in the park, and all arrangements and designs are being improved in sequence. In terms of performances, a staff member was sent north to hire Xi Cailian, a clapper opera actress with exceptional talent and skills, to perform at the park. The entire troupe has already been notified by telegram to depart from Peiping, and they will soon arrive in Shanghai to perform on stage. At that time, there will be a grand occasion.</p>

<h3>New Information on Overseas Car Races</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Recent automobile races held in various places. The more important ones, such as the Italian Grand Prix and the American Memorial Day Race, are matters of concern to the automotive industry. Therefore, I have compiled a summary as follows.</p>
<p>Car Race Held in Italy</p>
<p>The winner of the Nice Automobile Grand Prix held in Italy this time was Tazio Nuvolari. (The race distance was 200 miles. Nuvolari's average speed was 104.241 kilometers (equivalent to 65.15 miles per hour). The three British drivers who participated in the race, Louis Martin and Hugh Hamilton, withdrew due to obstacles encountered during the race. Hugh Hamilton's luck was the worst. He was driving an Alfa Romeo car. He was only ten laps away from the finish line, and the time difference between him and the first place, Nuvolari, was only three minutes. It is a pity that the engine failed and he was forced to withdraw. The audience, seeing that Hugh Hamilton's situation was unavoidable, cheered to show their support. This was enough to make the brave man feel a little relieved. Martin drove a Bugatti car and reached the 32nd lap. The clutch suddenly broke, so he had to leave the field. Louis stopped driving in the 40th lap due to a failure of the igniter. He was driving a Maserati car. As a result, out of the eighteen starters in the race, only six finished the race. The famous Italian driver Varzi won the prize with an Auto Union car of 1,500 cubic centimeters. His average speed in 20 laps was 139.402 kilometers per hour. His time was three hours, forty-three minutes, forty-five and two-fifths seconds. Rosemeyer was the runner-up. He also drove an Auto Union car, with a speed of 137.317 kilometers per hour in three hours and forty-seven and seven-tenths seconds. Brivio was third. He drove an Alfa Romeo car, with a time of three hours, fifty-one minutes, fifty-one and four-fifths seconds. The average speed was 133.523 kilometers per hour. The most exciting part of the car race was when Varzi's strong opponent, Nuvolari, withdrew after running 13 laps due to engine failure.</p>
<p>Briton Wins Car Race Championship</p>
<p>British car racing expert Richard Seaman recently won the championship in the 1,500 cubic centimeter car class in the Coppa Acerbo car race held in Pescara. Seaman was driving an ERA car. In the first four laps, he led his 26 rivals. The audience cheered him for his superb driving skills and his majestic posture. The distance of four laps was 64 miles. The speed per hour was 127.128 kilometers (equivalent to 80 miles per hour). His time was forty minutes and forty-two and two-fifths seconds. Seaman's fastest run was in the second lap, which he completed in twelve minutes and two seconds. The average speed was 128.569 kilometers per hour. The other two British car drivers were both defeated by Seaman. Bouts drove an MG and finished seventh. His average speed was 120.654 kilometers per hour. The time was fifty-six minutes, seven and one-fifth seconds. Evans also drove an MG car and withdrew after the first lap due to engine failure. Seaman's first rival, de Farnary, drove a Maserati car and also stopped driving after the first lap. Below Seaman was Italian car racer Bonzo, driving a Maserati car. His time was forty-nine minutes, fifty-two and one-fifth seconds. The average speed was 124.162 kilometers. Third was Stiffey, who drove a Bugatti car. His time was fifty-one minutes, nineteen and one-fifth seconds. The average speed was 120.654 kilometers.</p>
<h3>Manufacturing Cars for the Masses</h3>
<p>— Song</p>
<p>There will be no radical reforms in cars in the future. Car sales in the United States increased in May.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of future car styles, American car manufacturers unanimously tend towards streamlining. However, no one can say for sure to what extent streamlining should go. When it comes to the position of the engine, everyone believes that the trend of moving it to the rear has become an undeniable fact. Therefore, future cars will be particularly streamlined in appearance, and the engine will be moved to the rear. This trend is almost unanimously recognized by the automotive industry. However, I must say this again. If we carefully investigate the production center of American cars, Detroit, we can know that the innovations in cars in the next two or three years will not be overly sharp or overly radical. The reason is that radical changes place too much responsibility on the car companies. No one wants to take this risk.</p>
<p>Mr. Chrysler, General Manager of the American Pontiac Motor Company, recently expressed the above meaning. He went on to say that all car companies' plans for future new cars, all styles, engines, etc., must be shifted according to the habits of the masses. Therefore, future cars will be what drivers and passengers "want," not just what car companies want. Therefore, there will be no unusually radical reforms in the 1937 model cars in the major car factories. Mr. Chrysler also made an analogy, saying that if Pontiac built a 1937 model new car with a rear engine, everyone would naturally flock to the dealer's showroom to visit. However, as a result, not many people would want to buy it because many people would wait to see the results after others use it before daring to buy it.</p>
<p>Also, according to Mr. Chrysler, car companies want to know whether their annual car reforms are too radical. On this point, they focus most on the public's intentions. What they worry about is that the reforms are too novel and too far away from the public. The "penetration" problem of the car market aroused Mr. Chrysler's enthusiasm. He said that those who ask whether the car market is saturated are as foolish as those who ask whether the wheelbarrow is full because no one knows which answer is correct. The number of cars in Los Angeles has already exceeded 800,000, with an average of two cars for every three people. According to this ratio, the United States should currently have 83,000,000 cars, instead of the most generous estimate of 26,000,000. But who dares to say that it can never reach 83,000,000? Mr. Chrysler went on to say that, of course, before that number is reached, road engineering and road construction must undergo complete changes. What is needed now is not to obtain a large amount of roads with a small amount of money, but to obtain better roads with larger expenditures.</p>
<p>Recently, the number of car sales in various parts of the United States has been increasing, which shows that the renewal of the public's purchasing power is not false. Passenger car sales in May were only slightly higher than in April. In May, Chevrolet dealers sold a total of 129,816 passenger cars and trucks, completing the best record in three months. From January to May of this year, Chevrolet's sales were 535,634. Pontiac sold 21,278 cars in May, becoming a record that exceeded the crowd's expectations. Walter Chrysler's sales were 24,057 in May.</p>
<p>Buick's sales in May of this year were the best since 1928, totaling 17,689. Hudson's sales in May were similar to April's. According to its dealers' reports, a total of 60,764 were sold. The period was from January to May. Terraplane car sales are also included. Studebaker's sales in May were 8,705, which is almost the same as the 10,773 passenger cars and trucks sold in May 1929. In the past five months, its total sales were 40,008. Sales in the same period in 1929 were 50,533. Packard's sales in May exceeded the previous record, totaling over 7,200. Total sales this year have exceeded 27,000. The level of car sales will gradually decrease in the summer. This is the case every year. Business in rural areas usually improves in the summer. Currently, the weekly production of each car factory is 100,000 cars. This will gradually decrease in the future. Cars with current popular styles will be assembled by August 1st, but some companies will work until mid-August before stopping.</p>
<p>The trend of installing radios in cars is becoming more and more popular. According to recent estimates, the number of cars in the United States equipped with radios has exceeded 3,000,000. The proportion of new cars equipped with radios is increasing even more. Taking Chevrolet as an example, the percentage of new cars equipped with radios has increased from 15% to 22.5%. Chevrolet's management believes that having a radio in the car is a kind of enjoyment for drivers while riding, so they decided to set up a service department, with the general manager personally in charge of the matter. Under him, there are nine regional service managers to help dealers in various places promote the convenience of radio services.</p>
<h3>Pontiac Sales Soar</h3>
<p>According to reliable information, the number of retail sales of Pontiac cars in the United States was the highest in May. It ranks third among any May in the company's history. As for since 1929, there has never been a month with so many sales. The total number of retail sales of Pontiac cars in May of this year was 21,278. In April of last year, it was 19,481, and in May it was 16,209, both of which were far less. In the last ten days of May this year, Pontiac sold a total of 8,294. Compared with the sales for the entire month a year ago, this is an increase of 50%. According to Pontiac cars, since its debut, the sales in May of only 1928 and 1929 were more than in May of this year. As of June 1, a total of 104,997 Pontiac cars of the 1936 model have been delivered. As for the 1935 model a year ago, it was 66,985.</p>
<h3>A Week's Record of Car Accidents</h3>
<p>— San Yuan</p>
<p>There were a total of eight car accidents this week. One man died from serious injuries, three men were seriously injured, one man and one woman were slightly injured, and there was one case of mutual collision and property damage.</p>
