<h3>美國與加拿大合倂問題</h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>當歐洲的黑衫首相宣佈呑併阿比西尼亞與遠東的侵略者積極伸展其勢力於華北的時候美洲的新興帝國主義者也因看得眼紅而想併吞加拿大的一塊肥肉了我們試看美國的衆議員西羅維赫公然在十九日的國會中建議組織合併加拿大委員會調查美國與加拿大合併的可能性並研究加拿大能吾以州的資格加入美國聯邦就可知道美國是怎樣的垂涎着這塊口角邊的肥肉了</p>
<p>加拿大是大英帝國統治下的自治殖民地它雖遠處美洲北部但爲大不列顚世界帝國之不可分割的一部現在美國竟敢公然向這老大的帝國主義挑戰這在一般人的心目中不是覺得很可驚奇的嗎可是在熟悉國際情形者看來美國是早已向加拿大進攻了不過美國向外侵略的手段非常巧妙高明絕不像意日帝國主義者那樣的硬幹以致世人都不曾予以很大的注意罷了</p>
<p>美國是用什麽方法去侵略加拿大而向英國挑戰呢簡單地說美國是用它巨大的金元勢力去征服加拿大的整個市塲這種企圖且已獲得很大的成功這是可以拿事實來証明的在十餘年前英國在加拿大的經濟勢力是能控制一切的而近年以來情形就完全不同金元的勢力已經大量侵入而壓倒金鎊的勢力了先就投資方面說近年在加拿大的外國投資的有六萬萬餘鎊其中美國的投資要佔百分之六六而英國的則僅佔百分之三四次就加拿大的對外貿易說美國對加拿大的輸出也一年增加一年例如在去年一月與今年一月間加拿大的輸出總額計增加百分之二一·九其對美國的輸出僅增百分之一四·八而在同時期中加拿大的輸入總額祇增加百分之九但自美國的輸入額則增加百分之一三·五之多到了去年十一月美加二國更締結商務協定加拿大减低七百六十七種美貨的關稅美國也减低一百種重要的加拿大出品的關稅因此二國的經濟關係更形密切今年一月間加拿大自美國輸入農產品書籍雜誌電器與機械之數額比去年同時期中增加極大同時美國也自加拿大輸入大量木材酒類獸類與魚總之加拿大的經濟已經同美國結成極密切的關係而金鎊的勢力也已經被金元的勢力所壓倒了</p>
<p>美國不但在金融勢力方面已大量侵入加拿大壓倒英國的原有力量而且在政治方面也同加拿大發生極密切的關係允其是去年十月加拿大自由黨在選舉中獲得極大勝利而攫取政權以後美加商務協定就是自由黨領袖內閣總理金氏（Mackenzie　King）親到白宮締成的誠如美國評論之評論編者所說『金氏雖不反對英國但彼深知加拿大處在北美獨立自存其未來命運與美國密切連繫二國應保持極大的合作興親善」由上所述可知美國對加拿大的侵略政策已經得到怎樣程度的成功而西羅維赫議員之公然建議合併加拿大也無所用其驚奇了</p>
<p>但是英國對於美國的企圖能够緘口不言嗎這當然是絕對不會的因爲加拿大是大英帝國之生命綫的一環啊哇太華協定的締結實就是對於美國企圖的答覆現在因爲美國之進一步的垂涎加拿大英國亦必將採取更堅强的反攻姿勢果爾則全世界最大的二個帝國主義者的劇烈鬥爭又將重燃了</p>

<h3>經濟叢談</h3>
<p>— 唐慶增主編</p>
<h3>非常時期之財政問題（一）</h3>
<p>— 馬寅初</p>
<p>國際風雲緊急萬分、戰爭隨時可以爆發，中國難免不陷入漩渦，財政上應如何籌措，殊有先事講習之必要，以免臨渴掘井，庶能措置裕如，有條不紊，而無張惶失措之弊，茲分七點述之：</p>
<p>安定人心之必要</p>
<p>萬一中國對外發生戰爭，沿江沿海各縣市首當其衝，那時之財政非平時之財政，那時之經濟亦非平時之經濟，一切制度　形緊張，此時最關緊要者厥在安定人心，因人心能得安定，則恐慌不起，恐慌不起則社會不亂，此種安定心理必須在平時養成，臨時應付，奏效甚難，養之之道爲何，戰爭未起之前應早作經濟動員之凖備，戰時過後，一切事業破壞不堪，又須從速謀其恢復，其困難較動員時為尤甚，故動員之時更應兼顧復員之困難，庶能前後呼應，事半功倍矣。</p>
<p>中國財政制度不利於戰爭</p>
<p>中國財政制度實不利於戰爭，因租稅之全部幾皆由間接稅組成，間接稅之負担相對的以貧民爲最重，如關稅鹽稅統稅等爲中央收入之大宗，無一而非間接稅，布疋米麥等皆爲關稅之所及，貧民之所消耗不少於富人，奢侈品雖亦征稅，究屬有限，鹽稅亦然，貧民對鹽之消耗所占食物支出中之比例遠較富人爲大，統稅所及之火柴水泥捲烟麵粉棉紗等無不如此，故間接稅之負担以貧民爲最重，此種間接稅一經戰爭發生後，不但不能藉此增加稅率，蓋人民之負担不堪再重也，而固有之收入且將銳减，如關稅那時海口必被敵人多方封鎖，進出口買易不將爲之大减乎，貿易旣大减，稅收何能望其不减，鹽產以沿海一帶爲大宗，那時已成戰爭要地，能吾有充分之鹽可吃，尙成問題，豈尙有大宗之鹽稅收入乎，統稅亦然，如此稅制，如何可以應付戰爭乎，反之，倘以直接爲稅制之中心則情形適相反，所得稅遺產稅等皆爲優良之直接稅，其負担依富有之程度而纍加，若遇戰爭，雖加重至所得百分之六七十，不見其苛，國民財產一時亦不至隱匿或减少，故增稅之收入能如政府所預期，此謂和稅之伸縮性，凡具有此種伸縮性之租稅制度者頗足以應付戰爭，中國實一無所有，若積極改革現行稅制，使與文明國之稅制並駕齊驅，恐非短時間可以辦到，因舉辦所得稅必須先使人認識所得稅之意義，養成習慣，推行始易，如吾人有所得稅屬黨部收入，初行之時頗覺不快，今則習慣已成自然，淡然忘之矣，若一般人民根本不知所得稅爲何物，驟然施行，阻力必大，此不易者一，至遺產稅應先辦財產登記，又豈一二年內所能竣事，月有租界足爲隱匿財產之淵藪，若騾辦遺產稅，更有促進財產逋逃之危險，若發行公債，在歐美各國就戰費之數量言，無不以公債成分爲最大，以其籌措比較租稅爲迅速，而流弊不若濫發紙幣之甚也，中國之發行公債則不然，公債利益旣厚，購買公債者皆爲有財產之人，將來償還本息之基金不外賴租稅之收入，而間接稅之稅制其負担以平民爲最重，是則戰時如發行公債，何異加重貧民之犧牲，而予富人以發財之機會乎，故中國戰時發行公債量不公平，今日中國政府之財政，可稱公債之財政，唯知借新債還舊債，苟延殘喘，中國之交易所可稱公債之交易所，蓋不見有公司股票債票之交易，但見公債之充斥，公債流弊之深旣已如此，豈尙堪再發乎。</p>
<p>軍需品之眞實性</p>
<p>然則中國即不能打仗乎，是又不然，所謂租稅，形式上爲政府對人民所征人之錢幣，而政府實質所需者非錢其物，乃因錢可以招致之物耳，飛機槍砲以及其他軍用物品無錢不行，此錢之需要所以日亟，使不用錢亦可以招致同樣之物，則錢之有無不成問題，如各國戰時之征收制度，凡人民所生產或所固有之物品如可供政府戰時之需用者，政府皆可依法征收之，如是雖政府無錢，苟民間有充分之軍需物品，政府未嘗不可作戰，故法國雖當大革命之後，國庫空虛，元氣未復，法相拿破崙猶能支持規模宏大之戰爭，巴爾幹小國無一非財政困難者，亦演長期之混戰，波爾戰爭中，貧弱之波爾民族Boer猶能熱烈抵抗英國，且達三年之久，皆足爲吾人模範，德國大戰前準備一萬六千萬馬克現金，以爲足用，誰知戰爭一起，每日竟須耗去六千萬馬克，此區區儲積僅供三日之用，故預算上縱有幾萬萬之準備金，於戰時之需要言，誠屬渺小，而終能支持戰爭至四年之久，究何所依託乎，簡言之，不外賴其國民之人力與物力而已，荀人力與物力能有充分之準備，政府財政雖甚支絀，不足爲慮。</p>

<h3>化學科演講之三　中國化學發展史（上）</h3>
<p>— 國立編譯館專任編譯陳可忠</p>
<p>化學雖是近代科學之一，但是許多化學方法的應用，如釀造，冶金，製革，染色，和陶瓷製造等，人類在四五千年以前就已經知道了。世界上除了埃及以外，化學歷史最長久的要算中國，但是近代化學是從歐洲來的，我們要講中國化學發展的歷史，最好先把歐洲方面化畢演進的情形略爲叙述，因爲一方面我們可以將中西化學的歷史作一個比較，一方面由比絞的結果，大家可以明白我們應當如何努力，才能够負起繼往開來的責任。歐洲化學演進的歷史，大致可以分爲三個時期：</p>
<p>第一爲煉金術的時期——大紙從西歷第三世紀起，中間經過了很長久的時間，並沒有甚麼發展，一直到了第四世紀以後，才開始興盛起來。這樣繼續下去到了一五〇〇年左右，方才吿一段落。煉金術主要的目的，是把賤金屬變爲貴金屬。這時期的金丹家，理想雖然荒謬，但是其中有一部分的人，很肯下苦工作種種的探求，這種勇敢的精神很値得後人欽佩的。</p>
<p>第二爲醫藥化學的時期——大約從十六世紀初葉起，到了十七世紀以後，才興盛起來的。這時期時間很短，不過二百年左右。醫藥化學的主要目的，是在採取天然物質，用以養生治病，這個時期的理論，雖然仍舊沒有甚麼可取，但是在實騐方面，比較的近於實際，所以化學的發明，也漸漸的多起來了。</p>
<p>第三爲近代化學的時期——從十八世紀末葉，一直到現在，可以說是近代化學的時期。這時期的化學家，不作無謂的夢想，一切學術理論都是根據事實同實騐；所以近代化學的准步特別快，發明也特別多。要是和煉金醫藥兩個時期比較起來，時間雖是一與十之比，但是進步的程度和實際的貢獻，眞有天淵之別。</p>
<p>上面所說的是歐洲方而化學歷史的演進情形，至於中國化學進化的過程，大致同歐洲很相像，不過時代的分野，沒有歐洲那樣明瞭，並且煉金和醫藥兩個時期，在很長的時間內，很有同時並進的趨勢。但是爲了研究方便起見，我們也可以把他分做三個時期來看。從周末到唐代可以說是煉金術的時斯，從宋到明淸可以說是醫藥化學的時期，從淸末到現在可以說是近代化學的時期。我們要追述歐洲方面的化學歷史，只能講到煉金術的起源爲止，但在中國，煉金術以前，還有很長久很光榮的先史，値得我們注意的。醫如在周初的考工記裹面，關於用合金方法來製造各種器具的記載，不僅很多而且很詳細。我們要再追述上去，還有殷代的銅器，再上去還有神農的百草，這些都是研究化學很好的材料。就是傘煉金術來說，關於這一類有名的著作，在前有魏伯陽的參同契，在後有葛洪的抱朴子。葛洪這個名字，大概到過杭州遊過葛嶺的人，沒有不知道的。他雖然比較魏伯陽後了二百多年，但他所著的抱朴子，拿時代來講，已校歐洲煉金術最繁盛的時候，早了一百多年。要講到他的內容，也不是當時歐洲煉金術所能比得上的。我們過去化學的光榮歷史，當然不止這一點，大家都知道造紙同火藥都是我國發明的，這兩種發明，都是非常重要。此外還有我們的陶瓷，在明淸兩代特別出色，當時許多歐洲的國家，很費心思想仿製，但是始終沒有達到目的。從這些事實看起來，我們有兩點是很可引以自豪的。第一我們近代以前的化學，是由我國獨立產生的；第二我們　期的化舉，不特歷史比人家久，成績也比人家好。但是現在呢，我們的化學與歐美各國相形之下，眞是落伍得太遠了。現在我把我國近代化學所以不發達的原因，和將來的希望，向大家講一講：</p>
<p>我國近代的化學，是由歐美輸入的，歐美化學輸入我國的年代與輸人日本的年代差不多，大槪在同治元年，那時候淸朝在北京設立同文館，開始翻譯化學書籍，過了幾年，江南製造局成立，附設翻譯館，出版了大批的化舉書籍。現在我把這些書籍的名稱列下，諸位可以想見當時江南製造局對於西洋化舉的介紹，實在是很努力的：</p>
<p>關於化學的　化學源流四卷，化學工藝十二卷，化學材料中西名目表，化學鑑原六卷，化學分原八卷，化學補編六卷，化學考質八卷，化學求數十五卷。</p>

<h3>京市府　建築下水道</h3>
<p>預定計劃期以三年全部完成　七月一日起實施第一期工程</p>
<p>南京通信、南京市政府建築下水道、特設下水道工程處、進行一切、經費由荷蘭庚欵會撥一部份補助、分城南城北兩段埋裝水管、預定計劃、期以三年完成、現測量部分已　竣　决定七月一日起　實施第一期工程、茲誌進行情况於次、</p>
<p>南京向為舊式城市、溝政不修、由來已久、自定都以還、人口日增、房屋建築、隨時猛進、原有水塘、漸次塡塞　雨水汚水、益苦無處宣洩、穢臭湫濕　所在皆是、妨害市容及衛生、莫此為甚、下水道之設置、不容或緩、二十二年、以荷蘭庚欵、移辦京市水利、始於工務局內設下水道工程處、以專司之、乃先將城南部份測量完竣、計全長為十五萬五千公尺、二十四年秋　將城南區下水道工程計劃全部完成、至城北及　關、亦於二年九月測量完竣、計城北區全長為二萬一千九百六十三公尺、下關區全長為一萬六千五百九十六公尺、正在繼續進行、其計劃因南京地勢北高而南低、人口北稀而南密、宣洩之要、南先於北、而秦淮河橫貫城南、以歷朝勝蹟、流為藏納之所、盪條澄淸、可資利用、</p>
<p>雨水汚水、有分流合流二制、京市府對於此點、曾經審愼研究、以用分流制、則雨水入河、仍多挾汚、居民又示能明辨、隨意將汚水傾注於雨水管、雖名為分　而實不能盡分、用合流制、則平時汚水量少、可由截水管折出、迨雨久管盈、水質稀釋、始溢入河、雖名為合、而實則淸濁判然、且分流制須分設雨水汚水兩種水管、其工程費及保養費、皆超過合流制甚鉅、故决定城南區採用合流制、另用截水管分析之、使雨水洩入秦淮、而汚水由截水管至水西門漢西門間以抽水機抽入鐵管、引至三汶河、以達於江、至城北區則擬採用分流制、現仍從事研究、至汚水之處理、係採用江水稀釋法、汚水量與江水最小流量為一與二萬一千七百之比、如是汚水將盡被稀釋養化、絕無弊害可言、而用地需費、又較可節省、</p>
<p>惟下水道工程浩大、關於城南區合流管部份、約需四百十三萬三千三百十八元、關於截水管部份、約需八十二萬四千七百三十七元、關於入江水管及抽水設備等部份、約需七十萬五千元、合計全部工程約需五百六十六萬三千零五十五元、而其中截水管及入江水管提綱挈領之基本工程、僅居一百五十二萬九千七百三十七元、</p>
<p>以上所述費額、係就城南區工程估計、城北及下關區、尚不在內、已若是其鉅、勢難一時盡舉、京市府特權其輕重緩急、規定施工程序、其最要者、為自乾河沿徑竺橋東水關至漢西門間沿秦淮河兩岸截水管、以及自漢西門水西門間至三汶河口之入江水管、曁抽水設備等工程、蓋以此乃宣洩幹道為全市下水道提綱挈領之基本工程、茍將此部份提前完成、則此後各道路　之下水管、儘可隨時附麗、量力分期推進、不致牽動全部計劃、而澄淸秦淮水之根本辦法、亦必有賴於斯　、故擬假三年之功、以完成基本工程、至新築馬路下之下水管、則亦隨時連帶埋設、計於最近一年中、京市工務局增闢新路添築之下水管、有中山·珠江·莫愁·等路、內二十三公分徑者二·二二公里、三十公分徑者一·二六公里、四十五公分徑者三·四九公里、六十公分徑者一·九八公里、七十五公分徑者〇·四七公里、九十公分徑者〇·四五公里、共計增築一一·八七公里、幾及二十三年以前原有長度二六·五〇公里之二分之一、至新築尚未完成之昇州·建康·路西段等道路、其下水管亦正在埋築、長度之延展、更方興未艾也</p>

<h3>四徑練班　末次測騐詳記　淸華環境優良各選手認為滿意</h3>
<p>（產母特訊）我國參加世界運動會田徑訓練班在北平淸華大學訓練、每次測騐、均有進步、今日（　十二日）末次測騐、陳寶球之鐵球打破遠哀紀錄、尤為鉅大之收獲、今日下午四時開始測騐、觀衆達一千餘人、因遠在效外、城內之好運動者、下午捨棄春運會、特赴清華觀光、各項競賽、均有精彩、而鐵球一項最惹人注意、符保盧之撑高跳因桿子忽裝斷、未能繼續測騐、又不能造更新之紀錄、亦為美中之不足、茲分誌測騐結果及打破紀錄者談片如次、</p>
<p>各項測騐之結果</p>
<h3>打破紀錄者談片</h3>
<p>田徑訓練班在北平淸華大學連日訓　、成績頗有進步、第一次第二次與第三次測騐、雖有賈連仁吳必顯等打破全國紀錄、但每次僅一人有驚人成績、第四次測騐、符保盧之撑高跳、打破遠哀運動會日選手四田所保持之四公尺最高紀錄、符之成績達四公尺零一五之高度、黃英傑之高欄、郭潔之鐵餅、林紹洲之百十公尺高欄三項、又打破全國紀錄、第五次測騐最為精彩、鐵球一項尤有特殊之收獲、陳寶球一鳴驚人、其鐵球成績達十二公尺九七五之遙、打破遠哀日本阿部功所保持之十二公尺九零紀錄、其餘如八百公尺·標槍·高欄·跳高	·鐵餅五項、亦均打破全國紀錄、四百公尺平全國紀錄、記者因今日（二十二日）為最未次之測騐、又赴淸華大學除參觀測騐外、並訪問打破紀錄者、茲分誌各優秀之冠軍談話如次、</p>
<p>陳寶球談</p>
<p>鐵球打破遠哀紀錄者陳寶球語者、本人今日幸得結果、不敢云成績優秀、遠哀紀錄雖能打破、但參加世運會則殊難有希望、鐵球世界高紀錄為美國國托旦斯、成績十七公尺四十、本人今日僅打破日本阿部功在遠哀所保持之十二公尺九零五、以本人今日所創之十二公尺九七五比較、辦僅略有增進、如與美國托日斯相比、則猶小巫之見大巫、（按）陳氏第一次測騐、鐵球成績十二公尺七四五、打破金國紀錄二十公尺六九零、陳係廣哀人、二十五歲、現服務於平漢鐵路漢口總局總務處、</p>
<p>符保膚談</p>
<p>撑高跳打破遠哀紀錄者符何盧語記者、本人雖打破遠哀紀錄、但參加世運會、恐不能達到相當希望、本人在第九屆遠哀運動會成績僅三公尺六四、在第十屆遠哀、成績三公尺八十餘、最近始達四公尺〇一五、打破遠中運動會日本選手西田所保持之四公尺紀錄、本人自入田徑訓練班以來、深覺淸華環境較上海　越、故訓練後、獲得相當效果、惟平津無好桿子、本人所用之桿子今日已撑斷、故無進展、日本桿子較佳、因日人對於撑高跳頗注意、故桿子之性質及製法、均有硏究、撑高跳世界紀錄以美國密勒之四公尺十二為最高度、本人之成績尙不如遠甚云、（按）符氏係吉林濱江人、二十三歲、現服務於航空公司（未完）</p>

<p>標紗前市開盤、本月份雖以交割期限迫近、買方努力收進、然倉庫中存紗充足、且廠方亦有三星·大飛艇·雙鹿·金城等紗解進、由此人氣怠懈、前三個月一齊跌一元二角、遠跌五·六角、二三盤半定、結果各是比上日收盤價近跌一元五·六·五角、遠跌七·八·九角·午後開盤、市象平穏、上落數角之間、但大戶方面稍有購進、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲一·二·三角·查賣出裕大一千七百十包、德大一千包、賡豐三千四百五十包、元一九包、大昌成一千包、長豐二千五百包、永大一千四百包、同和一千零五十包、信誠一千七百包、買進錦昌六百包、大豐五百包、大孚八百包、澄記八百五十包、通記一千九百十包、明德　千六百包、聚興七百包、明華六百五十包、仁豐六百五十包、生游一千六百五十包、潤康一千三百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>遠期花市價稍昂</h3>
<p>棉市稍昂、本日期交貨籌碼雖有五·六萬担其中有二萬担細絨棉售價較標棉為高、業已抽回不交、遠期美安洋行獲利扒補、所以氣勢略帶堅挺云、</p>
<p>標花先跌後漲</p>
<p>票花前午開盤、美棉漲跌一至四磅音、印棉漲〇、五至〇·一羅比、大嚴三品花跌三·四角、市塲人心平庸、近跌一角半、拍至遠期轉趨堅昂、迨至二三盤、以紗市乏力、形勢暗澹、結果各月比上日收盤　跌五分至一角半、午後開盤、塲中交易淸澹、美安漢行在六·七月期扒補甚湧、三收盤情形仍佳、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲五分至一角半、查賣出撮大一千四百担、裕大一千担、德大一千二百担、吉豐二千八百擔、大豐一千一百擔、合興一千五百擔、森康一千七百擔、大昌成四千五百擔、大昶一千八百擔、源興昌一千六百担、益昶一千七百擔、潤康一千二百擔、賣進恒益一千三百擔、梅記三千九百擔、明華一千五百擔、愼昌二千八百擔、同和一千擔、信誠四千三百擔、益康一千八百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤列下、</p>

<h3>美棉獨漲七月期</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、各月漲跌二磅音、場中人心集中於囤棉處之售賣五月期、惟售額均為人吸收、餘月市况呆滯、散戶多頭了結、棉農套賣及外商賣出、為同業買進所抵銷、七月期因有投機買進、獨漲三磅音、業外買賣、依然寥寥、收盤平穏、計現貨跌三磅音、期貨漲三磅音至跌四磅音、英棉現貨漲二點、期貨漲一二點、印棉初因投機買進而堅、後因棉農套賣及歐洲出口商地售地回、計平果爾漲〇·二五至跌〇·五羅比、白羅溪跌〇·二五至〇·七五羅比、原電錄左、（二十二日電）</p>

<p>據最近某棉業機關報吿各地新棉狀况、大致云華北之彰德·天津·山東·河南·陜西等地受天雨之惠、江蘇·浙江·似不致有何特別增加、至多為一成五分左右、湖北·安徽·湖南各省、因冬季寒冷、蟲害减少、且棉價昂騰、農民一齊從事栽種棉花、然以位於長江流域、最近水漲、有侵淹棉地之虞、陜西省以罌栽種减少、及獎勵種棉之結果、棉田日增云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　本廠市集中漢口　南北兩方銷路銳减</h3>
<p>昨日棉市况平疲、實銷亦祇零星、華南北本年走銷銳减、故中外各廠均加深其注意力於華中之漢口、去年大成廠在漢設立支店、移貨推銷、成效顯著、最近有大批印花及整理布疋、印花色丁、克羅綢、府綢、漂布、條子漂布、藍布等貨運去、日商上海紗廠華商永安·大生·慶豐·蘇綸·與常邑各小規模染織廠、均增立經謂處、最近亦有大批布·細科·府綢·條漂·漂布·等貨運往傾銷、故漢埠去貨突踴、近二週內達千餘件之多、致本年漢埠競銷情勢、益形尖銳云、</p>

<h3>糧食　粉廠拋貨依然旺盛　市價因之終羅再振</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈初跌繼穏、最後復又反跌甚猛、當開價時、以洋麥報價、微好八分至二角左右不等、而氣候依然良好、故開價雖較前日小去一二分二盤以後、因浮空競補、出戶較稀、故又回上一二分、迨至下午開盤、各月份市面、又復傾瀉、因廠旺盛、大部分人心、覽於現銷之不佳、陳麥市價、亦復步跌、故客戶多頭、亦續回出、七月份以下、均見最低紀錄、六月份因傳下週起、照標凖加一角半、可以抽現故在環境惡劣之中、稍稍轉定、惟業中人之推測、以為六月份仍高於遠期、此後各現銷未能轉機、恐須逐步軋平云、</p>
<h3>麥市須視天氣為依歸</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份大致呈盤旋之象、以洋麥報價、上落無幾、業內外人心、因連日暴洛、恐有同檔、雙方之見解不同、交易雖暢、價則出入甚少、迨至下午開盤、各月份市氣、與上午仿、照目下情形、如天時仍好、麥市當看步疲也、現麥市面、日來廠胃平淡、市價則步步大鬆、惟正式交易甚少、特高貨已跌進四角關內、據業中人推測、陳麥有跌四元二角之勢云、昨聞山瑤灣麥三千包、價四元三角三分至三角三分由標新廠辦法、</p>
<p>美國小麥市面、受天燥報吿與五月期之影響、起仆無定、加麥出口淸淡、不久新麥月份將遇套賣壓力、</p>
<h3>甬帮暢辦中次客秈　價格得以站定</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、以天熱行囤、求售尤亟、浙油前日尙開十元零八九角、昨日開出已似發熱之機油、抵為九元六角半、其他中次亦多降價出售、但高貨仍不肯低脫也、且甬帮暢辦中關米、故中次各米、得站定、甬帮辦去機晚次米二千包、本街辦胃亦稍活絡、全口開江西米四千八百包、浙次油三百四十七包、</p>
<h3>薄稻北洋帮走銷見减</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各　來源共到二十餘號、（貨共五千餘石）、本街銷場尙屬平常、包胃因輪運缺乏、北洋帮祇辦薄稻四五百包、及厚粳、百餘包、故雖厚早粳及薄稻行情、結果無甚榮辱、而形勢已見帶軟、杜洋尖及陰變元亦疲象、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源念二四號、市上各貨去路依然淡弱、白粳高　未開、中次者價小三四分、薄稻零胃尙可、價形定勢、陰變元價帶疲勢、羊秞平定、埠杜客秈價疲數分、其餘各貨價仍看疲、</p>

<h3>油市　實銷不暢　蔴油繼續下跌</h3>
<p>蔴油市况、雖較最高價時已回跌三元之譜、然因價位仍高、實銷尙不易推動、値此生豆油市亦逐步修削之際、是以人心更弱、懷遠貨本週初雖已跌工二十六元三角、然貨主售心仍急、進戶亦乘勢殺價、致跌勢加厲、懷過油昨復開至二十四元五角、市竟猛挫一元八角之鉅、成交六百餘聽、由本街零星辦去、</p>
<h3>豆油又為大連操縱</h3>
<p>豆油市况本少活動、但昨市突被　大連市躍漲致本市亦起反動、昨晨市行情先漲一角、午盤再升一角、前後漲起二角、續成交各豆油四百五十件、照以上之成交數、其銷場尙屬不振、</p>
<h3>海味　暇尾移儲冷藏庫　好在存底均不豐足金山尾不滿一百桶</h3>
<p>蝦尾因天氣漸熱、極易變色發臭、故各路客帮、大中型有戒心、暫均减少添辦、非待秋冷氣爽、决不案於多進也、現下生意値落令之際、所以行號家、存貨較多者、刻已預備、存冷氣庫棧、待遇署夏、再行出賣、惟各貨存底、均不豐足、金鈎尾新貨、前到九箱、早已售通、後來續到、陳貨街底、僅有三四十箱、金山尾、統街亦不滿一百桶、（昨別報所刋存貨有五百餘桶、乃是謊報）、其餘別檔、更為稀少、昨市行盤、兜售高陳金鈎尾、一百零八元、普通貨一百零五元、金山尾中只一百二十五六元、小只一百十五元、田扁尾一百零二元、田蝦尾九十元、本港尾八十五元、香山尾節凈八十元、龍芽尾原貨四十五元、元東毛一百十元、朝扁尾一百元、江北小開尾六十元、尾頭子三十二元、其餘斷貨乏市查各檔中盤、比較上週、莫不下跌、觀之客銷呆鈍、此後尙防再鬆之勢云</p>

<h3>五金　美會司鐵市象漸見鞏固</h3>
<p>二百磅美會司鐵、前因日本方面有大批現貨裝來、標凖開盤騾見軟弱、故市場中開價由三十六元跌至三十四元、竟達二元之多、近數日來、市况已漸鞏固、蓋東貨已無續到、而紐約來價復報漲不已、（每箱七金元二角）且本市流通貨、亦屬不多、因此人心大定、價亦漸見回好、刻市老鋼廠貨開三十四元、新鋼廠貨沽三十三元五角、野雜貨亦可開至三十元、客帮交易雖仍未動辦、然本街製罐廠印　香烟廠等頗有點綴、查昨日開達四五百箱、聞均係北蘇州路一帶五金號聞出、查後批新貨進口不多、而成本又大、市價將益呈穏固云、</p>

<h3>讀書和有恒</h3>
<p>— 謝澐</p>
<p>「若要功夫深，鐵杵磨成針。」這是中國兩句俗諺。就是吿人做事，如果有恒心，不論怎樣困難的事，都可以做成功。小朋友，你們讀書都能夠有恒心嗎？</p>
<p>當我們未把書本翻開以前，我們應當明瞭書是什麼？書是供給智識的一種工具，讀書是改進生活豐富生活的一種手段，等到選擇定了有趣味的書籍，然後把全副的精神，貫注到一種書上，必完全明瞭後，才可以再讀第二種書，這樣子繼續不斷，經過了比較，體騐，觀察種種的過程後，我們的智識定會大大地增加，但是成功的基礎，就在「有恒」。</p>
<p>在中國古代，有許多關於「有恒」的格言，像「讀書如雛雞伏卵，不可須臾離開。」「讀書如逆水行舟，不進則退。」都可以給我們一些興奮和黽勉！「一日積一錢，三年積一千。」這兩句節儉的諺語，可以改成，「一日讀一篇，三年讀一千。」兩句「有恒」的格言，小朋友，你想讀到了一千多篇的書籍後，你們的智識，也就有相當的修養了！小朋友我敬祝你們的成功！</p>
<h3>幾個聰明的孩子</h3>
<p>— 平丹</p>
<p>王元澤四五歲時，有人把一麞一鹿同籠來獻。那人問元澤道「那一頭是麞？那一頭是鹿」？元澤本還不識何麞何鹿，便答道：「在麞邊的是鹿，在鹿邊的是麞」。</p>
<p>徐孺子在月下遊戲，有入指了月亮對他說：「倘使月中沒有黑影，不更明亮嗎」？孺子道：「不，這好比眼中的瞳子，沒有瞳子，便沒光明」。那時徐孺子還只九歲</p>
<p>王戎七歲時，與羣兒遊於郊外，見道旁一株李樹，結實甚多，羣兒競向採取。戎獨不動，並道：「這一定是苦李，因爲它在道旁而又多子」，試之果然。</p>
<p>晋明帝數歲，元帝把他抱在膝上問道：「長安遠，還是日遠」？答道：「日遠，不聞人從日邊來，只聞人從長安來」。到明日，元帝宴集羣臣，又把這話問他，明帝答道：「日近，長安遠」元帝很駭異的問他　爲甚說日近？答道：「舉目見日，不見長安」。</p>
<p>岳柱年八歲時，見何澄畫的截髮留賓中的陶母戴着金釧，便道：「陶母旣有金釧，儘可易酒欵賓，何必剪髮」？</p>
<p>王詔之少時家貧，好讀書，三日絕糧，還是執卷不輟。家人呵責他道：「如此窮困，還不去耕田」。詔之道：「正是，我天天在耕着呀」！</p>
<p>陳元方七歲時，他父親的好一個朋友在一天上一同出去的：後來因友屆時不至就先去了。不料去後，友人來了，問元方道：「尊君在家嗎「？答道：「待君不至，已去」。友怒詈道，「不是人，與人期行，竟先自去」。元方道：「君屆約時不來，是無信；對子罵父，是無禮」。友大慚，下車欲謝過；元方不願而入。</p>
<p>謝仁祖年八歲時，一天，他參加在他父親的許多上客中，儼然上流模樣。有人贊賞他道：「座中的一位少年顏回」。仁祖道：「不，座上沒有仲尼，那裏來的顏回」？</p>
<h3>漂白</h3>
<p>在星期日的那天天氣很好。敏兒到門外去玩，看見那邊廣塲上有許多白白的東西，他仔細的一看，原來是有很多的毛巾在陽光中晒着。他便跑過去，在那兒還有一隻很大的水缸，缸裏是放滿了淸水，在缸邊立着一個工人，不住的把毛巾放在缸裏洗，幷且都很臭的。那工人把這些毛巾都洗得很白，再也沒有一些臭味，敏兒看見了很爲奇怪，便問那缸邊的工人：</p>
<p>『老師父，這些毛巾爲什麼很臭的？』</p>
<p>『這些毛巾剛在漂白水裹漂白，所以是很臭的』。『什麼呌做漂白水？』漂白水是把漂白粉溶在水裏，它能把毛巾漂白，這漂白粉是怎樣做的？漂白水是把熟石灰放在貯灰室這貯灰室是鉛板或石片築成，它的四周是不透氣的。那室中的四壁有幾層木板，木板上是放的熟石灰，一層木板上大槪有一寸左右的石灰。室的另一面是一根鉛管，和另一室是相連的。另一室的裹面是製造氯。製造好的氯，從鉛管裏通到貯灰室，熟石灰便吸收氯，這樣的有一晝　夜，石灰便膨脹，成了漂白粉了。』『它怎能漂白的？』『那我不知道了。』那工人便笑笑的搖着頭跑開了。</p>
<p>敏兒很快的走到家裏，去問他的哥哥聰兒：『哥哥，漂白粉怎能漂白的？』</p>
<p>『有色的布，浸在漂白水裹，顏色，就漸漸的消褪了。但這種漂白作氯的本身能漂白，是由氯用，幷不是氯和水分解後便放出新生的氧。漂白粉要漂白，必須放些稀硫酸，就分解而生氧，就發生漂白作用，至於怎樣漂白？漂白的手續，是先把有顏色的布浸在漂白粉的溶液中，再把布浸在稀硫酸中，然後在淸水中漂洗，那塊布便很潔白的了。』聰兒這樣的說着。</p>

<p>科學小問題</p>
<h3>陰天有沒有太陽？</h3>
<p>— 子系</p>
<p>在沒有說陰天有沒有太陽之前，首先該把我們眼睛的構造大略地說一說：我們的眼球前面是一種水晶體，眼球後面是網膜，太陽的光錢，在通過了水晶體之後，也就在網膜上現出太陽的像來，網膜上有了像，網膜後面的視神經，就去報吿頭腦，於是我們就看見太陽了。要是，太陽和我們眼睛的中間，有了什麼阻隔，太陽光便不能透入我們的眼球，我們的網膜上自然不會現出太陽的像來，我們當然也不能見得太陽了。在陰天，空中彌漫着很多很厚的雨雲，太陽光就被它們（雨雲）阻止下射，自然不能透入我們的眼球，更不能在我們的網膜上現出像來，所以我們在陰天就看不見太陽了，其實在雨雲的上面，還是照射着燦爛的陽光，只要這些雨雲散去，太陽光自然仍會照耀大地而透入我們的眼球，由此可知陰天並非沒有太陽，不過我們在陰天看不見太陽吧了。小朋友！再也別懷疑吧：更莫再去迷信什麼神話了。</p>
<h3>燕和小孩</h3>
<p>— 戶人</p>
<p>天從　　暖了，燕子也從北方飛來了，它在人家簷下，做了窠，生下小鳥，等到天氣漸冷，才飛回去。</p>
<p>明兒家中屋簷下，也有燕子在那裹做了窠，天天總見它們飛來飛去。明兒很奇怪，常常想去看看，可是沒有得到父母的允許，是不能的。一天，乘着父母出去的時候，明兒偷倫地拿了一張梯，爬到上面去看，原來有三頭小燕在窠裹，老燕也不知何處去了，三頭小燕看見明兒十分驚嚇，都望窠裹退縮，明兒想道：「我倘使把它們捉到家中，養在籠裏，多麼有趣啊！」他伸伸手去捉，可是，小燕們看見了，用力地把嘴去喙明兒的手，明兒忙道：「小燕們！不要怕，我决不把你們弄傷。」小燕道：「不，我們的爸爸媽媽都不在家，我們不敢出外，因爲他們要尋我們的。」明兒道：「它尋有什麼道理呢？」燕道：「不但尋，而且尋不着，還要爲我們痛哭呢！」明兒道：「不要緊，讓他們哭好了。」小燕們道：「不能不能，我問你，倘使你的爸爸媽媽不在家時，有人來騙你去，那你想你的爸爸媽媽，要怎？樣「二定要哭」！「好！那麼我們跑掉了，我們的爸爸媽媽也要哭的呀」！「唔……」「他們父母的愛他，和我的爸爸媽媽愛我是一樣的！」明兒心中牢牢的記住了這句語。</p>
<h3>電影和卡通片的攝製法</h3>
<p>— 張亦菴</p>
<p>一部普通的電影是許多連續的　影接連地映出來的。所攝的東西或事實，有眞的，也有假的。假的事物來時，會叫你看見像眞的一樣，因爲看得出是假的那個部份沒有給攝進去，這是因爲攝影鏡頭的位置，遠近，角度等等的關係。比如一座很大的城牆，也許就只有幾尺大小，因爲用很近的拍攝，你就覺得它大了。電影裹的主角似乎冒着生命的危險，但是實際在拍攝時，他是很安全的。遠遠看見幾十層樓窗裹跳下一個人，但是那個人是假的。攝影的和導演的用了種種技巧，會叫我們看見戲裏所有的事物都同眞的一樣，會叫我們驚心動魄，揑着一把汗</p>
<p>當我們坐着看米老鼠和其他的奇奇怪怪的卡通片的時候，當然是會哈哈大笑。那時我們也許會想到：「這些角色實際上都是不存在的。怎樣拍攝出來而且會做出種種動作呢？　要解釋這件事情是簡單得很的。卡通電影是把許多單幅的圖畫連續拍攝起來的，每張都是人工畫成的。每一張畫却把動作的形狀略爲變動點，映出來的時候你便看見畫中的人物在動了。</p>
<p>你如果知道一部四百尺長的影片需要六千張以上的攝影時，你或者會担心到一倘畫家繪製一部卡通片需要好幾個月的工夫才得完工。不錯，如果每一張都要畫起來的話，所費的時候的確很長。但是他們有他們的聰明的方法。比如說，畫面上有一個站着的警察，在揮動他的臂膀，只有他的臂膀在動着。那末只消畫一個沒有臂膀的警察，另外在一些透明的東西上畫許多連續動作的臂膀，然後把這些動作位置不同的臂膀順着次序疊在警察的畫稿上一張張的拍攝起來。雖然用了這個省事的方法來繪製，可是一部卡通片仍然要很大的工夫。如果畫中動作的不止一條臂膀，全個身體都有動作，或者有第二偶角色加入時，那就只好一張一張的軍新畫起來了。</p>
<p>再有一事我們要知道的，一部卡通片的繪畫者不是一個人的工作，往往有一百幾十個人分任工作的；不過總有一兩個人把它預先計畫，再有一兩個主要的畫家把所需要的動作表情先打粗槁，然後由許多畫家去分担繪製。</p>

<p>我們已經談過了光，談過了水，談過了銀和金，銅和鐵；我們知道這些東西，都是遵守着一定的規律的；就和一架機器，遵守着一定的規雜在轉動着一樣。那末，活的東西是不是也遵守着一定的規雜呢？也許你要說了，一切有生命的東西，都是不遵守一定規律的。牠們是在科學定律之外的？眞的麼？假如你再想一想，你就會知道生物也是遵守着一定規律的。不說別的，單說革木吧，那一棵草木不是從種籽裏生畏出來的？鄕下人撒下稻種，才有秧長出來；撒下荳種，才有豆長出來。那些種花的人，也要撒下花籽，才有美麗的花長出來。沒有東西不是從種籽裹長出夾的。</p>
<p>就是動物，一條虫，一條小細　，也都是有種籽的。在夏天，腐收的肉上會生蛆。那些小虫子，會忽然在肉上蠕蠕的爬動起來。一個無知識的人，也許以爲肉上會自動的生出蛆米。那些蛆是從無中生有生出來的麼？不，决不是。蒼蠅大家都是知道的。蒼蠅在毛坑裏下蛋，才會生出蛆來。肉上會生蛆，一定要有一種肉蠅在肉上下蛋，蛋蛆化了之後，才有蛆出來。在夏天，蠅的蛋是孵化得很快的。這些如長大了，經過幾次變化，就會變成一隻蒼蠅飛出來。</p>
<p>還有些昆虫，能把牠的蛋產到別的活昆虫身上去。有一種野蜂叫做姬蜂，你們在夏秋的時候，很容易看到牠。牠會把牠的蛋，產到毛虫身上去。當牠看定一隻肥大的毛虫時，立刻飛上去騎在毛虫的身上，毛虫驚惶得扭動身子。可是，姬蜂已經很快的舉起牠尾巴上的刺，刺下去；不，那不是刺，而是牠的產卵管。牠很快的把牠的蛋，產在毛虫肚子上，飛開了。毛虫雖然不覺得什麼。牠仍然吃着葉子，活着。可是，不久姬蜂的蛋孵化了，生出許多像蛆似的蠐螬來。這些蠐螬就吃毛虫的肉和血，一直把牠吃得衹剩了一個空殼。這時候，蠐螬也已長大。不久，你就可以看到，那個空殼上蒙起一個絲袋，像繭似的。這個繭是蠐螬紡絲織成的。又過不久，繭破了，從裏面爬出姬蜂。在不知道的人，以爲毛虫會變成繭，會無中生有，生　姬蜂來呢！</p>
<p>姬蜂騎在一隻毛虫身上，高高的舉起牠的產卵管，把蛋產在毛虫身上。</p>
<p>我們還可以找出，許許多多有趣的例子來。就是使人生病的那些細菌吧，牠們也是有種籽的。當牠們一得了機會，侵入我們血管的時候，就像人們得了一塊大殖民地，很快的繁殖起來。可是，我們人　病倒了。唯一的方法，祗有保持淸潔不讓牠們鑽進來；其次是練好身體，使細菌不能在體內活動。</p>
<p>我們的話談得够長了，我們知道了一切有生命的東西，也是遵守着科學定律的。如果你們細心考察，就可以知道得更多。</p>

<h3>可憐的一個女孩</h3>
<p>— 萬竹小學三年級女生曹梅瑛</p>
<p>我們學校門外南邊的墻脚下，站着一個年約八九歲的小女孩子，伊的面孔黑黑，身上也骯髒得很，並且瘦得也怪難看，常常向着路過的人要錢。「有一天我放學回家，也走過伊跟前，伊向着我且哭且說：「小姐！謝謝你，給我一個銅板，可憐我今朝一天沒有吃過飯」那時我聽了伊的話，見伊哭得更可憐，手向袋裏一模，只有買書用賸的五個銅元，一個吃剩的芝蔴餅，一起給了伊。伊接了銅元，將蔴餅就吃，不多幾口，就吃完了，連說：「小姐！謝謝你」！我好奇心動，就問伊：「你這樣一個小女孩子，爲甚麼不到學校裹去讀書，却出來向路人要錢呢」？他回答我說：「小姐！我是眞可憐的。在三歲的辰光，吾家住在閘北，爸爸是開一爿小烟紙店，生意倒還好，後來打了仗，爸爸給敵人打死了。不到三個月，吾媽媽生病也死掉了。我一個親人也沒有，不得已才做這樣要飯的生活啦」。我聽聽伊話很苦，也就不要聽了。回家時一面走一面想，世界上最可憐的人，再沒有比沒有父母的人更可憐了。我自己是有爸爸，有媽媽，給我讀書，今天聽了這個女孩子的話，那我讀書應該要用功，並勸世界上有爸爸有媽媽的小朋友，大家要用功上進。</p>
<h3>義狗傳（二十）</h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>柏德希每到一家熟識的門口，仍是照常的停留下，抬頭瞧着人家默默地做出一種懇求的神情，人家却忍心的把門關了，讓那柏德希失望地拖着空車走去。他們別的都不爲甚麼，只為要博得柯甘士的歡心。</p>
<p>天氣非常的寒冷，地上的積雪足足有六尺深，冰結得很堅固，就是有許多人和牛在上面走過，也不會踏破。每逢這寒冬的時節，村中往往是很快樂的，任是最窮苦的人家也製備了糕餅和乳酒調和的欵料，糖製的聖像和鍍金的耶穌基督，大家說笑和跳舞，馬上的鈴聲到處叮叮噹噹的響着；每家的屋子裹，總有裝滿肉湯的鍋子在爐上沸着。那些圍着漂亮的圍巾和穿着簇新的外衣的少女們都笑着在雪地上往來，伊們是去做彌撒禮的。可是在那小屋子裹，却很黑暗，很寒冷。</p>
<p>原來在耶穌聖誕節前一禮拜的一個晚上，死神踏進了這小屋子的門，把老達士帶了去了，只拋下了小南洛和柏德希，很可憐的度着日子。老達士生牛飽受了窮困的苦痛，本來毫無生趣，又爲的害了一身癱病，不能動彈，早已好像是死了一半了。但是如今眞的一死，却使小南洛和柏德希倆受了一個很大的打擊，他們倆悲傷得甚麼似的。他老人家在睡夢中忽然悄悄的死了過去，直到天明之後，他門兩方始知道，頓時覺得一重悲哀和寂寞的空氣包圍了他們。老達士雖是一個癱瘓沒用的老人，再也不能舉起一隻手來保衛他們，然而他們倆是一向很愛他的，他們每天回來時，總見他老人家帶着笑歡迎着。他們嚎啕痛哭，不肯停止。在一個大雪粉飛的冬日，便跟着一具薄薄的棺木到那小禮拜堂旁邊一座無名的義塚上去，送葬的只有他們倆，而他們倆在這世界上也沒有甚麼親人了。</p>

<p>經濟往來</p>
<h3>美國鐵道經濟近况</h3>
<p>— 孫益知</p>
<p>在羅斯福的所謂新政之下，近兩年夾美國經濟在許多地方的確表現出了好轉的現象。但這好轉，正如許多經濟研究者所指示出的一樣，是人爲的，而且是畸形的不調和的。這種情形，我們在最近美國的飛機製造工業·造船業·汽車工業以及其他有關軍事的工業之過分發展上可以見到；同時，在鐵道界及某些主要產業中，就是這樣的景氣也表現得很微弱，或甚至連這樣的景氣都談不到。現在，我們就具體地來考察一下最近美國鐵道界的情形吧。</p>
<p>據美國鐵道經濟局的調查，夫年美國第一流鐵道公司的營業總收入是三十四億四千萬美元，這不僅比較一九三一年以來的增加了許多，就是比較前年的總收入也增加了百分之五·一五。單就這個情形看來，人們當然可以毫不思索地說這也是美國景氣好轉的一種表現。然而，我們首先還要注意，就在去年度，美國鐵道的營業費也同時增加了，比較前年計增加了百分之五·四五，總數達二十五億七千五百萬美元，所以，結局在純收入上，去年比較前年並未增加好多。事實上，去年美國的投資利率（Return　on　property　investment）是百分之一·九〇，這與前年的百分之一·八〇比較起來，就並未顯示出好大的增加。</p>
<p>如果我們總觀最近十餘年來美國鐵道收入和其投資利率的情形，那便更可說美國的鐵道營業不僅未曾眞的好轉，而且可說是還在不景氣中。請看下表吧。</p>
<p>美國第一流鐵道公司收入表</p>
<p>總收入（百萬美元）　投資利率％</p>
<p>一九二三年　六·三六〇　四·三三</p>
<p>二四年　五·九八八　四·二一</p>
<p>二五年　六·一八七　四·七四</p>
<p>二六年　六·四六五　四·九八</p>
<p>二七年　六·二一〇　四·三〇</p>
<p>二八年　六·一九〇　四·六五</p>
<p>二九年　六·中六〇　四·八四</p>
<p>三〇年　五·三四三　三·三〇</p>
<p>三一年　四·二三六　二·〇〇</p>
<p>三二年　三·一六二　一·二五</p>
<p>三三年　三·〇九二　一·八三</p>
<p>三四年　三·二七一　一·八〇</p>
<p>三五年　三·四四〇　一·九〇</p>
<p>由這個統計數字看來，我們當可明白知道，近兩年來美國鐵道的收入不僅遠不及一九二九年的恐慌以前的數目，而且就在羅斯福的所謂新政策施行以後，這收入也未見得比以前有好大的增加。</p>
<p>再就鐵道運輸貨物的情形來說，我們在一方面也可見到近年來美國鐵道運貨量確有顯著的增加。例如到去年十二月二十八日止，五十二週間運輸貨物的貨車數目是三千一百五十一萬八千車，比較前年同期計增加了百分之二·一八；比較一九三二年同期更是增加了百分之二·八五。但在另一方面，由於同業的競爭，鐵道運費却减少了，因此，雖然運輸貨物量有增加，但鐵道營業收入却並未成正比例地增加，要想回復恐慌前的收入水準仍是很難的。</p>
<p>同時，美國的企業家和圍繞在羅斯福周圍的經濟學者雖在高唱繁榮之歌，做復興的夢，但美國的多數國民却仍在日益貧窮化中。因此，近年來美國各鐵道的旅客並不擁擠。雖然各鐵道公司爲了吸收旅客，在努力改良火車的設施，减低車費，但結果除增加競爭費用外，並未得到多大的收穫。據統計，美國第一流鐵道公司的旅客車費收入對於貨物運費收入的比例，一九二〇年是佔百分之二九·八，但在一九二九年時却减爲百分之一八·一，一九三四年時更减低爲百分之一三·二了，及至現在仍沒有什麼起色。這個事實已經充分表明了美國的多數人民是在日益窮化中，同時也就表明了在現狀下美國鐵道的營業實沒有恢復舊觀和發達的希望。</p>
<p>最後，値得玩味的，是在最近美國鐵路的運貨中農村生產品有着顯著的减少。這在去年度有如下的統計—</p>
<p>貨物種類　貨車數　與前年比較（％）</p>
<p>（單位千輛）</p>
<p>穀物類　一·五七七　（一）四·二</p>
<p>家畜類　七一五　（一）三三·五</p>
<p>石炭　六·一四七　（十）〇·二</p>
<p>烰炭　三四六　（十）三·九</p>
<p>林產物　一·三八三　（十）二〇·四</p>
<p>鑛物　九九三　（十）二五·二</p>
<p>雜貨　八·一二二　（十）一·四</p>
<p>其他　一二·二三五　（十）六·六</p>
<p>總計　三一·五一八　（十）二·二</p>
<p>在這個統計中，很明顯地表現着美國農產物，特別是家畜類的由農村輸出量是在减少。這不消說是顯示了美國的農業恐慌在羅斯福的所謂新政之下還在日益深化。同時，因爲農業的不振，因爲農產物由鐵道運輸的特別减少，鐵道的營業當然也要受到極大的影響。這情形，在最近美國西部農業地帶的鐵道營業非常不振的事實中，表現得尤其顯明。</p>
<p>由於上述這些困難，美國許多鐵道公司的經營便不得不日益陷於苦境。目前美國鐵道最嚴重的問題便是有許多小的鐵道公司瀕於破產了。就在所謂營業景氣恢復的一九三五年，美國小鐵道公司破產的事還在繼續產生；總計起</p>
<h3>介紹「康健世界」第七期</h3>
<p>— 如</p>
<p>眞是「糟糕意沒斯」！距本刋發稿時間只有五分鐘，而我這篇介紹文字還未着一字，編輯先生已經催了我好幾次，交白卷總覺得不好意思，於是只有臨時抱佛脚，胡亂寫幾句了。</p>
<p>五分鐘！滿腦袋都充塞着「五分鐘」：—「五分鐘體操，「五分鐘熱度」，「五分鐘小說」，「五分鐘」……</p>
<p>好！一分鐘很快的過去了！</p>
<p>時間越走越快，文章越做越難，爺爺！我應該寫些什麼呢？可是我却想到了一件事，就是：能於早晨實行從事「五分鐘體操」的人是有的，但若能天天如此，永遠不間斷的却很少，他們都不過只有「五分鐘熱度」而已。</p>
<p>乖乖龍帝東！又是一分鐘過去了！</p>
<p>不管他！文章總得做下去！總算上帝救了我，使我又想到了一件事，就是：實行從事「五分鐘體操」的人不一定就能寫作「五分鐘小說」，自來有大勇的人不一定就是有大智的人人。</p>
<p>現在，且讓我來貢獻給讀者一點意見：如果你要想能實行從事「五分鐘體操」，而同時又能保持「五分鐘」以上的「熱度」，又能寫「五分鐘小說」，那最好還是去定閱「康健世界」，因爲該刋的內容不但注重個人身體上的康健，而且也注重個人精神上的鍛鍊，文學上的修養和思想上的健全，這是該刋與一般保健刋物的不同之點。還有……還有……</p>
<p>可是，時間老是和我作對，正當我寫得很起勁，文思源源而來的時候，又是一分鐘過去了！現在，只剩兩分鐘了，我也不高興再寫下去，就把報上關於該刋的一段小新聞抄錄下來，作個結束罷：</p>
<p>精神飽滿之康健世界月刋，第七期已於十六日出版，內容豐富，文字的有二十餘篇，其最傑出者，如康健齋夫之回到原始的健康生活·朱寒松君之健康與人生·張劍靑君之飮食衛生漫談·家鳳君之女性結婚後生理上之變化·吳信法君之改良「來沙而」之製法等，康健畫報欄，有健美女性的動態多幀，至原有各欄精采文字，仍保持不失，每冊零售連郵六分，預定全年十二冊國內連郵衹國幣五角，國外一元，該刋生活書店各大報攤及各處各大圖書雜誌公司均有出售，聞以前六期尙有餘書可補，欲補者可另附幣四角，直向上海同孚路二一四弄一四號康健世界社總發行所，卽行寄奉。</p>

<p>來，在去年度通過管理人由法院管理的鐵道公司就有八十九家，它們的營業路線達七萬二千哩，這的確是美國鐵道史上最新最高的記錄！</p>
<p>這樣的小鐵道公司之繼續破產，在一方面自然是充分說明了美國鐵道營業仍未脫離不景氣的災難，同時在另一方面，更表現出了美國鐵道方面的大小資本家競爭之厲害，所謂小鐵道公司之破產，在這一點上可說是大資本併吞小資本的現象，也可說是美國壟斷資本之更進一步的發展。</p>
<p>對於壟斷事業，從前在表面上各國政府還在禁止，可是，隨着資本的集中，隨着世界危機的發展，許多國家便不得不公然扶助壟斷事業的發展了。美國羅斯福的所謂新政，除明白廢除反托拉司法規外，更在公共事業的美名下用政府的財力帮助壟斷事業的發展。對於鐵道壟斷者當然也是盡力帮助了的。例如在一九三叫年，美國政府爲了鐵道改造，曾在公共事業的美名下支給了鐵道壟斷者二〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元，並給以信用貸欵的優時條件，將借欵的百分之四延長十五年到三十年，而第一年完全不收利息。這樣，美國鐵道界自然在一方面表現出了一點起色，但在另一方面却也促成了許多小鐵道公司更快的破產，使鐵道壟斷的情勢更向着極端方向發展。</p>
<p>都知道「金元王國」是當今世界最富的國家，但在事實上，美國的財富現在全操縱在六十四人的手中。在這中間，掌握鐵道費本，壟斷鐵道事業者當然更是少數人。目前羅斯福的新政便是在努力帮助道少數人的發展。所以，如果美國鐵道界表現出了好况，那在一方面只不過是少數壟斷者的好况，而許多小鐵道公司是在日益破產的，許多美國人民也是在日益窮化的。這種情形發展的結果，由於一般購買力的日益减少，就是那些所謂第一流的鐵道營業亦將要更行不振；因而，即使有政府的幫助，鐵道壟斷者恐亦難免陷入無法　持的苦境。事實上，目前美國整個鐵道界的情形，如上所說，也確是不可樂觀的。</p>

<h3>巴黎的五月</h3>
<p>— 元慶</p>
<p>巴黎，向有「花都」之稱。這裹有世界最大的歌劇塲，有各式各樣的舞廳，有美麗的自然風景，有足以誇耀全歐的許多名勝古跋；只要你有錢，在這裹的確可以享盡人間一切快樂的。</p>
<p>在初夏的五月時侯，自然界的一切早已甦生了。巴黎市內的小公園，街旁的樹木，郊外的森林和草地，都是一片新豔的綠色。如果五月的莫斯科是赤色的世界，那五月的巴黎便可說是綠色的公園了</p>
<p>凡爾賽宮，是人所共知的巴黎許多名勝之一。這座宮殿的建築，風景，都是不易多見的；在五月的時候，因爲一切樹木花草都正在甦生繁茂，常然更加美麗。同時，有名的凡爾賽噴水，在過去，從五月到十月，每禮拜一都可觀賞，但現在只有初夏的五月可以一見：這樣一來，當然更加强了五月巴黎的風景。</p>
<p>凡爾賽庭園爲當年著名庭園師魯，洛特爾所建造。它的特點是所有莊嚴的宮殿，自然的地勢，一木一石，都是左右均齊調和的；可說是路易十四時代的代表的庭園藝術。</p>
<p>此外，五月五日太陽落沒在凱旋門正中一事，也頗有興趣。據此間流行的解說，則是五月五日恰好是拿破崙逝世的日子，這天太陽從凱旋門正中落沒下去，便是拿破崙逝世的表示。這當然是英雄崇拜的迷信說法。不過，大概是因爲地球運轉的關係吧，在每年的五月，雖不一定是五日，但總有一天太陽的確要落沒在凱旋門的正中。這樣，人工的建築與自然的美景便融合了；這種融合的美景是只有在五月的巴黎才能見到的。</p>

<p>工商業實踐</p>
<h3>商店的調查工作</h3>
<p>— 河淸</p>
<p>無論做什麼事情的人，當然隨時都會注意與他的事情有關係的問題，這是不待說的。至於一般經營工商業的生意人，那更是時刻都在留心金融界的情形，貨價的高低，買客的動態以及工商業界的一切事情，這似乎更用不着別人來担心。不過，一般商店和商品製造家，對於他們有關係的事之調查和關心，往往是隨意的，無政府狀態的。譬如，有些能幹的生意人確是常常都在跑交易所，看工商業新聞乃至廣吿，打聽一切工商業的消息，因而對於和他的生意有關的一切事情他都是非常明白的；但因爲他的行動是個人的沒有計劃的行動，並不是他所經營的事業的有組織的科學的行動，所以結果收益較少。我們知道，目前是科學的時代，也是工商業競爭最尖銳的時代，進出在商塲中的人都必要以最科學的方法來經營他的事業，才有勝利的可能；在這中間，就是很小的事情都當以精密的計劃去進行；一般的調查事業，關係到營業競爭的方針的决定和實施，更是應該特別留意，不當草率從事的。</p>
<p>歐美和日本的大的百貨商店，在他們的科學的合理的組織中，就設立的有調查科，專門調查各種工商業的情形，藉以不斷决定新的營業方針。同時，就是只有五六個店員的中小商店，也特別訓練店員們的調查知識，並經常有計劃地輪流派出店員去做調查工作，以增加營業的效能。</p>
<p>一般說來，商店的調查工作，主要地必須注意這幾點：</p>
<p>第一、經常調查一般市民的非常事件。如結婚，做壽，生產孩子，建造房屋，疾病死亡，團體集會等等；因爲這些事情與許多商店的營業都有很密切的關係：如果一家商店探知了某市民有上述那樣的非常事件發生，而這事件又是與他的營業有深切關係的，那他就可以很快决定用各種方法去做這筆生意了。反之，假使這商店平時未注意調查工作，那這生意就很少可能自己跑上門來。</p>
<p>第二、調查各同業的商店組織和資本數量以及經營手法，以便倣效別人的長處，去除自己的短處，並在根本上决定自己的兢爭方針。</p>
<p>第三、調查全市所有的自己所經營的貨物的數量和質量及其流動情形，調查外埠的與自己有關的商業及本市的關於自己貨物的消費能力，以决定根本的營業計劃。</p>
<p>第四、經常留心國內外的一切政治經濟的動態。</p>
<p>這樣，在每一個調查工作有了實際材料後，商店店主便當很民主地召集全店職員店員（或少數重要店員）會商，共同决定對付方針。如是地一天一天進行下去，那商店必可在不斷革新，不斷獲得新的買主下日益發展起來的。</p>
<p>目前中國有些商店也頗注意調查工作，如特設的推銷員，跑街等等，便可說是負有一部分調查任務的。但一般說來，還是說不上科學化。我們應該倣效他人，很精密地分劃出調查的事情，有計劃地訓練並派出調查人員，必要時還可製定調查表格來塡寫所得的各項實際材料，這樣科學地進行調查工作，對於營業的發展是有很大關係的。</p>
<p>生活指導</p>
<h3>怎樣當書店店員？</h3>
<p>— 繼常</p>
<p>在從前，所謂「書賈」，他們是以畢生的經騐，日與書籍爲伍。所以他們的智識每每較某些讀書人爲駁雜，爲廣汎。他們知道古籍的版本，或爲宋版，或爲明版；他們知道那些書是「珍本」，是「孤本」，是「秘本」。因之古籍的價値，古書的內容，以及其校訂之善吾，其篇章之完缺，都淸消楚楚地知道。還有，他們頗通「目錄」之學，知道某些書應屬於某部類，一方面是以便於供給購求者之選擇索取，另一方面也可應購求者之邀請，而代爲蒐集尋覓。所以「書賈」一事雖是粗淺的一種職業，但如眞地要做得好，却也並不是一件容易的事。</p>
<p>現在，西學東漸，科學代興。不但從前的古籍如經史子集之類，你做書店生意的人要相當知共梗概；而且新出的雜誌報章你史要充分熟習。所以要爲書店服務，眞地說來，其困難或更甚於從前吧。所以要從事於書業之經營的人，不管你作書店的總經理也好，管「出版」也好，做「營業部」「發行部」也好，甚至做店員也好，對於一般必須知道的知識，你也非明白一個大槪不可的。</p>
<p>至於做經理的，做主任的，我們這裹用不着說他。因爲他們起碼是具有一般知識，有相當的經騐，能明瞭書業市場一般的需要，以定其提供的方針，能視時勢之轉移而定其出書之性質，或專以營利爲目的，或間以「文化任務」爲己任，總之他們大概都有「目的意識性」，用不着我們吿訴他們一些甚麼的。我們的對象是一般書店的店員。自然，因書店之大小，而店員也有許多種類，如「跑街」，如「坐櫃」，有由「小工」而升作店員的，也有由店員而升作「先生」的，總之我們是以做技術工作的人員爲對象。</p>
<p>爲了容易說明而且要說得有條理起見，我們不妨假定一種書店爲說明的對象。我們所取的標本，幷不是「商務」「中華」那樣大的，組織完備，分工精細的書店，而是那些中小書店。因爲，如果我們要做大書局的「從業員」，我們的程度是要經過考試的，對於該項職業的應有知識在被取錄後，有一時期的訓練敎育和指導的。但是中小書店的店員就要全靠自已的學習了。而且大書店　事務，因爲分鬥別類，工作甚爲單純，容易純熟；但中小書店，則有一人而身兼數職的，有　人而由初步工作漸次昇到高級工作的，所以其變化甚大，工作內容很複雜，我們在這兒不能不一一加以指示。</p>
<p>如上所述的畫店，看來似乎只要識字而粗知書理的人，普通就可以做店員了。但是，不管該書店所營的業務是怎樣的單純，如只是辦發行，而不設門市部，或只是一家獨賣，而不代人批發或代售；但是；一個書店，如耍圖營業的發展，那你决不是閉關自守所能成功的，你必須要去穿揷尋覓許許多多的關係，去盡一些目前不一定馬上可以獲得報酬的義務。如代讀者尋找書目，如答復讀者關於出版界的消息，不獲酬報而受讀者之託，代他訂購書報。因爲由這些工作，你可以給某些同你有「來往」的主顧以好的印象，他可以作你永久的顧客。並且他可以　你多「拉關係」，「介紹生意」。一個書店，最怕的是沒有讀者過問，因爲書店與書店的關係尙是找「售路」的間接道路，而書店和讀者間的關係才是「售路」的直接方法。這是「千鈞一髮」不可放過的機會。書店决不能孤立的。還有，你須得多方找「代售處」。因爲你總店的目標太小，你所及的範圍太近，即使你有分店，但在窮鄕僻壞，你總需要有個小的代售處，何况在某些大都市斷不是你一家分店所能控制或顧及的，所以需要借人家的關係和信用來做你的生意，正等於你代購別家的書而是根據你的關係和信用一樣。所以書店業務之最重要的是在謀書店和讀者間之密切的速繫，而且要盡量謀其發展增進，其次是在書店和書店間，即同業間之切實的連絡和互助。</p>
<p>因爲業務之擴張，而書店從業員之知識便要相應地豐富。先就本店說，如有一個讀者，單是看了你書店的目錄或報上所登的廣吿，他對於你所出的某書的內容尙嫌知道得不充分，還須更進一步地明瞭，他寫信來問訊，你當然要盡可能地答復他。但是你本人對某些書尙未有大概的了解，即是說是某人著，是那部門的書，有些甚麼篇章，如這些你都不知道，你又何從答復人家呢？單就你本書店所出的書，如統要大體知其內容，這也已不是容易的事了，何况要向人优購？固然我們不能說要充分具備選書購書的學識，但是大概的目錄學上的常識你是要知道的，而且各同業所進的目錄册子與夫各報上所刊載的新書預的和廣吿等，你都得隨時留意和收集，這樣你才能饜讀者或外埠代售處之望。到了自己出了新書時，你以前的經常讀者或本店雜誌的「訂戶」，你都要在平時把他們的通倌處登記下來，把新書目或單頁廣吿寄去。出了一種新書，有些公共機關，允其是各大學的圖書館，你應馬上贈送一册。這是頂有效力的廣吿。總之，你要抓着一切的機會，來做你的職務。</p>
<p>從「批書」的賬簿上，你可以看出某些性質的書一般地好銷，某些書在某些地方好銷。根據這點，不特可以規定自己「添書」的數量，而且將此種情形報吿到編輯部，還可以修改規定出版的方針。好銷的書無妨多添一些進去，不好銷的書當少添一些，而改添旁的。要看某些市場之容納量如何，要看某些市場所管轄下的讀者程度如何，來定新出的書之批發的數量。不然，不是供不應求，便是「久停不售」，都是一種損失。</p>
<p>還有，現在郵購之法大行，某些鄙遠地方，沒有分店和代售處的地方，你如隨時把目錄向郵局登記，而同郵局又訂有合同，那你的書是能深入各處的。還有郵局也能代你兌欵的，自然牠要取手續費，不過很少。運書也是一件頂麻煩的事情。如果「裝包」不善或所託非人，書籍的損失是很大的。此外還要注意速率。如果有時間性的書報，寄運費時，而途程又遠，損失也不小。火概大部分書籍是從郵局寄運，有些則找運輸公司。總之要看水路和旱路，要看安全和「運　」如何而定。</p>
<p>以上是一般的知識，至於要適應特殊情形，也還有許多曲折而狡猾的把戲，道雖不可以之對人，但確也要懂得一點，才免得「上當」。在市場不景氣的現在，所謂「回佣」「折扣」鬧得一塌糊塗。在先是各代售處的批發同你　折扣，六五折呵，七五折呵批出去。但是「現批」是很少的，有保證金的代售處也很少。在鄙遠而生意又不多的外埠，不但不能按期「結賬」，而且時有「倒閉」「停業」「拖欠」等把戲，可是你不能派人去查問。在打折扣之後，每到年終又同你打一個「九五」或「八五」回佣。抑或實際上　已「售　」，却給你報吿說「存貨」尙多，你又那能知道？這等等意外之事，商場上的狡計，你是要「穩愼」，要度量情形，方能相當避免的，切不可輕信，浮躁。但是又不可因此就過於拘泥，還　要在愼重中拘着冒險的精神。自然這是以「損失不大」而父能覓取新的市場爲目標的。</p>
<p>總之，要作一個精幹的書店從業員，除了要懂得上述知識外，是要專心鍛鍊才能稱職成功的，這决不是一件容易的事情。</p>

<h3>大明湖</h3>
<p>— 家鄉</p>
<p>在北方的自然環境中，濟南這個地方是非常特異的。牠的附近不僅具有很多秀麗的山，而且到處都是明媚的水。在濟南北面，相距五六里，有著名的黃河，從西往東橫過。靠近城根的有小淸河，成爲濟南與其東北各縣的水路交通要道。而在風景方面最引人入勝的，要算是大明湖了。</p>
<p>大明湖位置在濟南城的北部，佔有全城面積的一半。雖近年來有不少欣慕風雅的人們逐年把這湖塡塞，建立房屋，致其面積不免逐漸縮小，但這不但沒有影響到大明湖的美麗，而且反因紅樓繡閣的點綴，益增其嫵媚了。</p>
<p>湖內的大部分是用小堤劃成無數的方形湖田。</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>湖田內完全種植着荷花。周圍的小堤上則叢生着蘆葦，間或也有幾株楊柳桃花之類的，聳立搖曳於其間。此外便是遊船所行的水道，縱橫錯綜，引人入勝。要是在夏季荷葦都已長成的時侯，這些水道就變成神秘的小港。坐在小船上駛入其中，只見荷紅葦綠和飄浮在水面的萍草，而忘却城市的煩囂。</p>
<p>在湖的中間和其四周，有很多的建築和並不怎樣古老的勝跡。湖的中央是著名的歷下亭。在其四岸又有張公祠，匯泉寺，李公祠，圖書館，鐵公祠和北極閣等。在這些名勝的地方，都有茶館，小吃等的設備，作爲遊人遊覽之餘，駐足休息之用。</p>
<p>歷下亭孤立在湖的中央，四面完全被水圍繞着，沒有陸路可通。所以，通常都稱牠作「孤立亭」，這地方的面積雖然不大，但建築也相當的複雜。除了中央的歷下亭外，周圍也有樓閣遊廊等的建築。亭子的中央有淸代乾隆皇帝寫的御碑，前後的高樓上都可以品茗。如果是在夏季，不僅可以在此覽盡全湖和濟南）周圍的風景？而且也是納凉的勝地。歷下亭無論在風景方面或歷史方面都是最好最古的，這從牠門首所懸的名句「海右此亭古，濟南名士多」中便可以見到了。</p>
<p>在湖的東岸是匯泉寺和張公祠。匯泉寺是一個普通廟宇，在以前因香火較盛，建築的規模也較大，所以遊人甚多，但近來已大非昔比了。張公祠在匯泉寺之東，兩面臨水，由陸路也可以到達。在大朋湖的各建築中這是最壯麗的一個。張公祠是淸代張曜的生祠。他曾在山東做過巡撫。後來因監修黃河的工程失敗，黃河汎瀾，鬧出很大的水災，不得已投黃河而死了。地方上的人士爲了紀念他，給他建築這個生祠。祠的規模很大，內面有樓閣，院中有荷塘，假山，亭榭等。臨湖的兩面都可以納凉垂釣，應爲有閑人遊息的勝地。</p>
<p>北極閣在張公祠之北。建立在城墻的上面。裹面也是普通的廟宇，不過住持的是道士。這閣因爲是建立在城墻上的數層高樓，所以是個最高的地方。站在這上面，南向可以望見整個的大明湖和距濟南十里的千佛山；東西對峙的鵲華二山也歷歷在目。北面則可俯瞰長如黃帶的黃河和城外的湖田。</p>
<p>據濟南人的傳說，北極閣在濟南的風水上有極重要的作用。因爲濟南多水，一般人便都把這個城市認爲是一隻寳貴的船。而北極閣就是鎮壓着這隻船，使牠不至在大水汎瀾的時候隨水漂流而去的。這雖然是無稽的「齊東野人」之語，但在閉塞的舊時代中，耗費這樣鉅大的工程，當然有其迷信的意義的。</p>
<p>鐵公祠在大明湖的西北岸，如果從陸地去就必須繞很遙遠的道路。因爲牠位於城的極西北角。這個祠宇也是比較古遠的。牠是爲紀念明朝初年堅守濟南城的鐵鉉而立的。當明成祖在燕京羽翼豐滿的時候，他便起兵南下奪取他姪子的天下。走到濟南就過到鐵鉉這個勁敵。圍城數月，始終沒有結果，後來不得已便引黃河的水灌城，纔把濟南攻下，鐵鉉就與城俱殉了。這個祠宇的規模也很大，又因不久以前重修過，所以比大明湖周圍的任何建築都是煥然一新的。祠的四周圍繞着新式的鐵欄杆，院中滿佈着各種花圃，又有數株年代久遠的老柳隨風搖曳着，別具一種風韻。殿中有鐵鉉的塑像，兩廊下有很多古代的碑碣，使很多遊人都到此駐足憑弔。這地方因爲去湖的中心較遠，所以牠的風景是以幽靜見勝的。</p>
<p>鐵公祠的對面便是李公祠。這祠是爲淸末的李鴻章而立的。祠的建黨比較張公祠略爲小些，其內部的佈置也沒有什麼特殊的地方。</p>
<p>大明湖的西岸是山東省立圖書館，這圖書館的規模雖不怎樣大，但內部所包括的各種部門却很複雜。</p>
<p>進門不遠便是一間很大的閱覽室。裹面的書籍，中文的比較多，雜誌也是如此。在這閱覽室的旁邊，陳列着很多的古物。這些古物大半是在山東出士的。其中主要的是周秦之間的銅器，陶器，玉器等。再往裹面走，經過一個小橋，一段遊廊，便進到另一個院落。在這院落中，南邊是一座高樓，北邊是三間大廳。南邊的高樓，無諭上下都陳列着各種標本。其中生即標本，各種動物標本都有。北邊的大廳也是一個標本陳列室，不過，大部份是關於農產物和礦物的罷了。此外還有一部份動物如猴子，灰鶴之類的在院中各處點綴着。</p>
<p>院中的佈置也頗具匠心。有曲折的小河，突兀的假山，荷塘，亭榭等，在現在最惹遊人注意的，恐怕要算那兩個密茂美艷的芍藥圃和牡丹圃了。</p>
<p>因爲這個圖書館是兼有博物館，動物園，古物陳列所和公園等的性質，所以吸引得遊人特別多。每日遊人往來總是擁擠不堪的。其中一部份固然是爲的來讀書，但多數是來遊覽觀光的。</p>
<p>大明湖的風景，因季節的不同而變異其姿態，遊人的多寡也是因季節而異的。在春夏兩季是遊人最盛的時候，秋冬就比較的少了。春季的大明湖如新裝的少女，所以最引動人們的遊興。夏季的大明湖是最宜於享受的時候，駕一葉小舟，任其漂流蕩漾於湖的各方，看荷花，吃蓮蓬，嚼花下藕，納凉等，眞把一切塵世的煩惱遺忘無餘了。</p>
<p>湖中的遊船分大小兩種。小船沒有船艙，可坐三四人。中問置有茶棹，可以圍坐品茗。大船是所謂「畫舫」，船身很大，上有玻璃艙，裹面有許多裝飾。這種船因爲價錢太昻，大半爲家族，團體或闊人們所用，一般遊人是很少問津的。至於由個人划行的遊艇，除了私人所有的外，還沒有出租的。</p>
<p>大明湖中每年有一次盛大的集會。這就是舊歷七月十五日的盂蘭會。這日在湖周圍的祠宇寺院中大都舉行祭祀和超度等典禮。湖中各處則大放其荷燈及熖火等。因此，濟南市的男女老幼便萬人空巷地集中到湖的周圍來了。</p>
<p>哲學講座</p>
<h3>叉麻雀</h3>
<p>— 助國</p>
<p>叉麻雀一事，普通是認爲一種無聊的消遣，費時誤事。但是這種遊戲如與那「跑狗」「跑馬」「輪盤賭」等比較起來，那又此較地多帶一些遊戲的性質，不大含有賭博的興味。如果我們不以金錢之輸贏而以玩法之巧妙來决定勝負，那叉麻雀反而是一種藝術，同下圍棋和象棋的性質差不多。</p>
<p>看起來叉麻雀是很簡單而全憑幸運的一種事情，但實際上其中是有許多巧妙的道理的。孔子說：「雖小道亦有可觀」，在叉麻雀的事件中也能考見人的智靈和技巧。如從哲學的見地去看，那更有研究的價値了。</p>
<p>凡事之發生都有原因。因緣和合，一定產生出某種結果來。决無無因之果，亦無無果之因。這種法則在哲學上就呌做因果必然律。但是在另一方面，又有許多偶然發生的事情，看來似乎是沒有因果規律可尋。在科學的研究中是本着因果法則的，如沒有因果法則，則科學之研究便成爲不可能。然而在遊戲和賭博的場合中，一般人就大半說是偶然，是碰幸運了。這兩種看法究竟誰對誰不對呢？我們可以從叉麻雀一事來加以研究。</p>
<p>如果只從某一方之「合牌」不「合牌」，「合牌」多或「合牌」少來說，那也許可認爲這是偶然；當甲方已經「落聽」，而　所待之牌又非常容易出現時，人家却偏不打出，乙方的牌非常的壞，而又不易爲人打出時，甲方偏偏合不成，而乙方反得合了，這看來是純屬偶然。但是，這只是就甲方一方的立場來說，或只就乙方一方的立塲來說，表面上係屬偶然，而不是把甲方和乙方以及其餘兩方通同拿來考察的緣故。如果我們知道四方的牌，又考察已經打過的牌，那末在甲方認爲容易合而反不合，在乙方認爲不容易合而反得合的原因便充分明白了。由此可以證明，在叉麻雀一事件中，還是有一種因果必然律支配着，决不是單憑幸運偶然而發生的。甲方之所謂偶然，是因爲他不知道乙方和其他兩方的情形的緣故。所以說，偶然是未知道其原因或未充分知道其原因而發生的事件。所以說偶然是屬於必然之下的。</p>
<p>但是我們就能說偶然純成於主觀，而在客觀上並不存在嗎？這也不然。我們又可從叉麻雀來看。甲方有他自己的安排，計劃，他的牌之搆成，其來法，其去法，都有一定的規律，循着這規律，便可達到合牌的希望。如果自己不會打，不看外面的情形，不依自己的牌的路錢，卽是說不照自己的牌的發展法則，那是勝少敗多的。但是這樣的事情也有，不怕你縱計劃得如何的精妙，估量得如何的縝密，但是始終你不能合牌，這又是甚麼原因呢？分明人家手上有一張「空牌」，但他始終不放，而偏放另外的牌，這父是甚麼原因呢？不怕你需要的「張子」再多，但偏偏砌在近尾的磴子上，使你摸不着。這不是偶然嗎？可見偶然的事實也客觀存在，並不是完全由於主觀之未認識。</p>
<p>但是偶然性和必然性小是相矛盾而同時存在嗎？是的，偶然相必然同時存在，這是一個矛盾，但矛盾是統一於現實之中的。從叉麻雀一事也可說明。在整個運動過程中，如在打牌的全體行程中，某人之成功不成功，某人之勝或負，都受着整個的因果法則的支配的，但在各個人自己一方的運動體系中，雖也有因果法則支配，但這是要受共同的整個的因果法則的支配的，而且每一方的自動法則又要受其餘幾方的運動法則的影響的，卽是說相互發生交互作用。當着部分的法則與總的法則衝突，當着各部分的法則相互衝突時，就生出了偶然事件。所以說偶然事件也是客觀存在的</p>
<p>正因爲客觀存在有必然性和偶然性兩個東西，所以叉麻雀的人就有各種的勝負形態表式出來。有些牌藝嫻熟精通的人反而敗於牌藝粗疏的人。這是因爲他自身只能依着自己一方牌的運動法則和大槪把握全塲的運動法則，而不能完完全全知道整個的安排，而且自己沒有機會取得某些牌，因這等等偶然的不及料的原因，他是失敗了。而又有些人牌藝雖然不精，但是他恰巧同整個的運動法則相適應，又偶然取得某些張子，所以能成功。但是，這我們决不是說叉麻雀就是全憑偶然了。如果你依正當的路綫進行大有合牌的可能，而你却打錯了牌，或不注意全局的情形，那你多半是會失誤的。如果你機遇不好，但能緊緊地把握着自己和全局的法則，你總不至於完全幫助了敵人。卽是說從運動的因果法則中去行動，人爲的力量是有作用的。</p>
<p>從上而看來，叉麻雀也有，一套很深的哲學道理，我們不可等閒視之。</p>

<h3>斬路易十六的刀</h3>
<p>— 凡</p>
<p>最近，巴黎的拍賣塲拍賣了一件珍貴的東西，那便是曾斬過去法皇路易十六的頭的斷頭臺刀。據說在起初拍賣時就有人出二千法郞，後來漸次增高，結果是以一萬二千五百法郞出賣了；承買的人，是專門蒐集法國大革命時代的紀念物的。</p>
<p>自這件事的消息傳出後，有些會作非非想的法蘭西人說：如果你要想你的後人發財，就當留心致死當今位高名大的人物的東西；無論是手槍炸彈或者鐵鎚，你都要好好地把它收藏起來，作爲傳家之寳，一代一代地傳下去，到了某一個時候自然會値大錢的。</p>

<h3>大餅攤（完）</h3>
<p>— 沈愛蓉女士</p>
<p>『喲！小狗子上學堂去念書啦，大喜呀！小狗子媽，你做太太的日子快來了。可別忘了我們窮鄰舍啊！』</p>
<p>『這們大的孩子了，不呌他想法賺幾個錢，却要學少爺的派頭上學去念書。嘿！烏鴉要學鳳凰樣，節直是不配。』</p>
<p>『俗語得得好：「龍養龍，鳳養鳳，老鼠的兒子會打洞。」我想，做大餅的養出來的兒子，也不會發達到那兒去的。』</p>
<p>對於這些含譏帶諷的話，傳進了小狗子媽的耳朶裏，她當然覺得很氣憤，可是她好勝要强的個性使她的意志更堅决了，不但不呌她兒子退學，並且更督促得嚴厲了。</p>
<p>誰都知道現在的小狗子媽是個窮光蛋，可是在一年前，她也是一個老闆娘娘呀！雖然是一個大餅店的老闆娘娘。她的爸——根生，是開大餅店的，單生了她這個寳貝女兒，所以捨不得嫁她出去，就把一個夥計招贅在家，就是現在的小狗子爸，人是頂忠厚勤儉的。小夫妻二口子到很合得來，同心合力的帮着根生勤勤儉儉的做大餅，倒也很可以過得去。後來根生過世了，就把他唯一的遺產——大餅店——傳給了他們，還傳給他們一筆債——喪事所用去的。小狗子媽自她爸死後，生活陷於極度的困苦中：市面是這樣的壞，雖然是三個銅元的大餅油條，也捨不得買來吃，而物價却這樣貴，每天做不到一元錢，除去本錢外，掙餘的只够做每天的伙食費。每月二十元的房租，夥計的三元薪水，還有那一筆三十元的債，可怎麼辦呢？開源乏術，只有節流，緊縮，緊縮。先把夥計辭退了，小狗子媽代替了夥計的職位，每天遲一些生爐子，晚上早一些熄爐子，可以省些煤；大餅縮小些，油條變短些，少加些糖或鹽，成本可以减少一些，但這種偸工减料的自殺政策，不但不能使經濟寬裕些，反而速顧客都趕跑了，生意是愈益淸淡了，生活是更艱苦了，債主的脚步幾乎踏平了大餅店的門檻。最後終於維持不了，只得把店盤給人家，償淸了債務，出三塊錢一月房金，搬到貧民窟裹去住，用五塊錢捐了一張照會，在法租界擺了一個大餅攤，仗了小狗子媽的能幹，小狗子爸的勤儉，開銷又省，又沒有債務，生意却比從前好，因爲他們又添了糖蔴球，脆蔴花，香脆餅幾樣新出品，並且做得又大又可口，顧客吃了都稱讚一聲好。</p>
<p>小狗子媽曾做過老闆娘娘，在這貧民窟的一羣婦女中，可以算是首屆一指了。也就爲了這一點，小狗子媽和旁的婦女——貧民窟中的婦女不同，她對於穿得齊齊整整的奶奶太太，一絲兒都瞧不入眼，更不能使她對於奶奶太太們有一絲敬畏或羨慕之心。有時她看見買水菓的阿發老婆，對漂亮的女顧客「老闆娘」「老闆娘」呌得震天響的時候，她老是要笑她十足的奴隸氣。等顧客去後，裝出不屑一視的樣子，冷笑着對阿發老婆道：「老闆娘？老闆娘買幾錢一斤，値得你這樣奉承？我小狗子媽不也是老闆娘出身的？看她們這種拗頸擺屁股的騷勁兒，神氣活現的有什麼屁用？到倒霉的時候，恐怕連要飯都沒有路啦！」</p>
<p>她不但對於高貴有錢的太太奶奶們沒有好戚，就是對於太太奶奶御用的娘姨大姐，也是痛心疾首的，她就不喜歡瞧那狗仗人勢的醜樣兒。所以當娘姨大姐到她那裹買油條的時候，她故意慢絲條理的切麵條，用麵棒重重的按着二條相疊的麵條，輕輕的放在油鍋中煎，有時娘姨大姐等得不耐煩了催促一聲，她更煎得慢了，儘用着長竹筷，把油鍋中的油條撥來撥去，並且在肚子裹暗暗的駡道：「出了三個銅子，就要神氣，不煎給你怎樣，狗一般的東西，回去給你主婦駡一頓，也呌我快樂。」</p>
<p>除了討厭多嘴的鄰居，和狗仗人勢的娘姨大姐外，小狗子媽對誰都是客客氣氣的，她不憎恨誰，也不妒忌誰，更不羨慕誰，她只運用着她特別强壯的身體，埋首幹着，不怨天，也不尤人，不喊辛苦，也不偸懶，因爲她有一個美滿的幻想，在驅使她努力工作，就是那兩個小寳貝——小狗子和小臘子，將來能、出人頭地，跳出了貧民窟，踏進了長衫階級，至於長衫階級的生活有沒有她理想中那樣的美滿，那却不是小狗子媽所能知道的了。（完）</p>

<h3>The Issue of the United States and Canada Merging</h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>While the black-shirted Prime Minister of Europe announced the annexation of Abyssinia and the aggressors in the Far East are actively extending their power in North China, the emerging imperialists in America are also envious and want to annex the fat meat of Canada. We see that US Congressman Sirovich openly suggested in the Congress on the 19th to organize a committee to merge Canada, investigate the possibility of merging the United States and Canada, and study whether Canada can join the United States as a state. This shows how much the United States is coveting this piece of fat meat on the corner of its mouth.</p>
<p>Canada is an autonomous colony under the rule of the British Empire. Although it is located in northern America, it is an inseparable part of the British world empire. Now the United States dares to openly challenge this old imperialism. Isn't this very surprising to the general public? However, to those familiar with the international situation, the United States has already attacked Canada. However, the United States' methods of foreign aggression are very clever and sophisticated, unlike the brute force of Italian and Japanese imperialists, so the world has not paid much attention to it.</p>
<p>What methods does the United States use to invade Canada and challenge Britain? Simply put, the United States uses its huge financial power to conquer the entire Canadian market. This attempt has been very successful, which can be proven by the facts. More than ten years ago, the economic power of Britain in Canada could control everything. However, in recent years, the situation has completely changed. The power of the dollar has greatly invaded and overwhelmed the power of the pound. First of all, in terms of investment, in recent years, foreign investment in Canada has been more than 600 million pounds, of which US investment accounts for 66% and British investment only accounts for 34%. Secondly, in terms of Canada's foreign trade, US exports to Canada are increasing year by year. For example, between January of last year and January of this year, Canada's total exports increased by 21.9%, while its exports to the United States only increased by 14.8%. At the same time, Canada's total imports only increased by 9%, but its imports from the United States increased by 13.5%. In November of last year, the United States and Canada concluded a business agreement to reduce tariffs on 767 US goods, and the United States also reduced tariffs on 100 important Canadian products. Therefore, the economic relationship between the two countries has become closer. In January of this year, Canada's imports of agricultural products, books, magazines, electrical appliances, and machinery from the United States increased greatly compared with the same period last year. At the same time, the United States also imported a large amount of timber, alcohol, animals, and fish from Canada. In short, Canada's economy has formed a very close relationship with the United States, and the power of the pound has been overwhelmed by the power of the dollar.</p>
<p>The United States has not only greatly invaded Canada and overwhelmed the original power of Britain in terms of financial power, but also has a very close relationship with Canada in terms of politics. In particular, after the Liberal Party of Canada won a great victory in the election last October and seized power, the US-Canada business agreement was concluded by the Liberal Party leader, Prime Minister King, himself at the White House. As the editor of the American Review of Reviews said, "Although King is not opposed to Britain, he knows that Canada is located in North America and exists independently. Its future destiny is closely linked to the United States. The two countries should maintain great cooperation and friendship." From the above, it can be seen to what extent the US aggression policy against Canada has been successful, and Congressman Sirovich's open proposal to merge Canada is not surprising.</p>
<p>But can Britain remain silent about the United States' intentions? Of course not, because Canada is a vital lifeline of the British Empire. The conclusion of the Ottawa Agreement was a response to the US attempt. Now, because the United States is further coveting Canada, Britain will inevitably take a stronger counter-offensive stance. If so, the fierce struggle between the two largest imperialists in the world will be rekindled.</p>
<h3>Japanese Minister of the Army, Terauchi, Explains the Scope of Military Intervention in Politics: Active-Duty Soldiers Unrelated to Military Affairs Must Not Express Opinions on Politics</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The boundaries of Japanese military involvement in political issues have always lacked clarity. During the committee review of the anti-sedition document control bill in the House of Representatives on the 22nd, Kuraura Toshimaro of the National League explained that military interference in politics was a phenomenon after the Manchurian Incident. He argued that if soldiers wanted to discuss political matters outside of their duties, they should resign from their current positions before interfering in politics. Kuraura also pointed out that the cause of seditious documents lies in military interference in politics and demanded an answer from Minister of the Army Terauchi regarding the application of Article 103 of the Army Criminal Code. Minseito's Itsumatsu Sadakichi also questioned the Army Criminal Code. Minister of the Army Terauchi and Director-General of the Legislation Bureau Oyama responded that active-duty soldiers of the Army Ministry are responsible for assisting the Minister of the Army and managing military affairs. Submitting opinions, suggestions, or discussions on politics is a natural duty. However, active-duty soldiers unrelated to military affairs are not allowed to submit opinions, suggestions, or discuss political issues. Active-duty soldiers who engage in such behavior outside of their duties should be punished according to Article 103 of the Army Criminal Code and Article 104 of the Navy Criminal Code.

<p>(Tokyo) The Secrets Protection Bill was examined in the House of Representatives committee this morning.

Seiyukai's Sunada Shigemasa advocated for a closed-door meeting, and Inukai and Kawasaki expressed their agreement. The atmosphere in the committee was extremely tense for a time.

<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives held a plenary session at 1:00 PM on the 23rd to deliberate the resolution on House of Representatives reform. Tawara Sun-ichi took the stage and stated that the Japanese parliamentary system was established in accordance with the Imperial Constitution and would not be changed in the future. However, there are various inconveniences in the current House of Representatives Law, so appropriate changes should be made. The key points of the changes are as follows:</p>
<p>The current opening of the session in December should be changed to November.</p>
<p>The current fiscal year, from April to March of the following year, should be changed to from July to June of the following year.</p>
<p>Establishing a standing committee system would allow the parliamentary function, which is suspended during the recess, to continue to operate.</p>
<p>In order to raise the prestige of the parliament, the status of the Speaker and Vice-Speaker should be raised, and all members should be treated preferentially. When making decisions, the entire body should stand up to vote, except for Koyama Ryo, who did not stand up. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The powerful weapon of Japan's trade protectionism, the Trade Defense Law, was decided by the parliament to be extended for another year and was announced in the official gazette on the 23rd. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Japanese Tateyama Air Group Trains in Hokkaido: Twenty-Two Elite Aircraft Conduct Four Days of Mobile Flight Training</h3>
<p>Tateyama: The Tateyama Naval Air Group will lead a total of twenty-two elite seaplanes and land-based aircraft, starting on the 25th, for four days, using Sapporo and Otaru in Hokkaido as the center, to conduct mobile flight training. The participating aircraft include four carrier-based fighters and twelve carrier-based attack aircraft, divided into four teams, for a total of twenty-two aircraft. At the same time, they will take off from Tateyama and soar over the skies of Hokkaido for active training, scheduled to fly back on the 28th, it is said. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Waku aircraft of the Tateyama Naval Air Group, which was engaged in flying between Changchun and Tateyama, was piloted by Petty Officer Waku at 9:00 AM yesterday, carrying seven passengers. It took off from Changchun Airfield, crossed over Mount Paektu, and was returning to Tateyama over the Sea of Japan. Suddenly, at 11:00 AM yesterday, it crashed in Tiantang in Mingyue Lake between Dunhua and Yanji on the Jingtulu road due to a malfunction. The passengers either parachuted down. However, since the area is a zone of activity for righteous armies, it is questionable whether they can safely land and preserve their lives, even if they can land safely. Therefore, the garrison and flight team are now fully searching for them. (Dentsu News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the main force of the First Division Headquarters was ordered to go to Manchuria, its attached units are departing one after another.

<h3>Australia-Japan Trade War: Australian Government's New Trade Policy, Japan Sees as the First Shot in the Trade War</h3>
<p>Melbourne: The Australian government announced a new trade policy yesterday, the main points of which are a large increase in tariffs and a licensing system for many foreign goods. According to news from Japan, this is said to be the first shot in the trade war between the two countries. The Australian government is deeply uneasy about this. Responsible parties claim that Japan will not be greatly harmed by this new policy and will actually benefit because Japan is a good customer for Australian goods and can receive very preferential treatment. The Australian Department of Commerce will issue licenses for the import of Japanese rayon. This license is only intended to block the import of American rayon. The Australian Department of Commerce will approve license applications from good customers. Japan is one of them. The Australian government does not want to crack down on or increase tariffs on Japanese rayon and other textiles. In terms of the new policy, the United States currently has 2,214,000 pounds of trade with Australia, which will lose about 3 million pounds. Except for goods necessary for the country and those that help Australian workers, the rest will be subject to the licensing system. However, small cars and typewriters will be banned, it is said. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Australia has raised tariffs on Japanese cotton fabrics and rayon fabrics. The Japanese government is studying concrete measures to implement the Trade Defense Law in response, focusing on the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. However, the system of allowing the import of wool and wheat produced in Australia has always been adopted and is considered suitable for the current situation. If the actual use of boycotts has any impact, a careful investigation will be conducted on this situation. It is planned to consult with the Ministry of Finance around the 28th to discuss concrete measures, and then convene a meeting of the Tariff Investigation Council to deliberate. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>US Increases Tariffs on Japanese Goods: Unrelated to the Philippine Market</h3>
<p>(Washington) Officials announced today that the increase in US import duties on cotton fabrics does not affect the US-Philippine agreement. The gentleman's agreement to divide the Philippine market has not yet been negotiated, so the current agreement will continue to be valid. According to the US Tariff Commission, Japanese cotton fabric exports to the Philippines totaled 87,481,000 yards last year, 75,748,000 yards the previous year, and 34,910,000 yards in 1933.

<h3>Hindenburg Airship Drops Flowers: Finder Attempts to Place at Priest's Brother's Grave</h3>
<p>(London) The German airship Hindenburg, currently flying from the US back to Germany, dropped a small package while flying over Calffrey Town in Wiltshire, England, today. Inside was a bouquet of carnations, along with a note signed by Schulz, the first priest traveling on the airship. The note stated that the finder should place the flowers on his brother's grave. According to the note, Schulz's brother was captured during the European War and later died of illness, and was buried near Lies. The finder should find his grave and place the flowers on it. It is decided that after the Hindenburg returns to the country, it will have completed two round-trip flights between Germany and the United States. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Dum Dum Bullet Case: New Dispute Arises Between Britain and Italy; Italy Still Accuses Britain of Supplying Albanian Army</h3>

<h3>British Cabinet to be Reorganized at the End of the Month; Resignation of Colonial Secretary Approved</h3>
<p>(London) The talk of a cabinet reshuffle has recently been confirmed and will take place during the Pentecost (May 31st) parliamentary recess. Observers believe that Prime Minister Baldwin finds it difficult to maintain the current form of the national cabinet. After the cabinet reshuffle, the Conservative Party's color may become more pronounced. However, if Lord De La Warr, Under-Secretary of State for Education (affiliated with the National Labour Party), succeeds Thomas in the vacant position of Colonial Secretary, then the situation will be different. Other candidates for the vacant position of Colonial Secretary include Minister of Public Works Ormsby-Gore, former Colonial Secretary Amery, and Conservative MP Lord Windlesham. Among them, Windlesham is closely associated with Conservative extremists such as Churchill, which displeases Baldwin, making his chances of succession the slightest. Finally, it has been suggested that the current Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, MacDonald, be transferred to Colonial Secretary, and former Foreign Secretary Hoare be appointed to replace him as Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (originally intended to succeed Lord Monsell as First Lord of the Admiralty). However, in any case, the list of new cabinet members will not be announced before Pentecost. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) Colonial Secretary Thomas has been approved for resigning due to the budget leak, and First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell will also retire. Therefore, it is expected that the cabinet will be completely reorganized. There is talk that former Foreign Secretary Hoare will re-enter the cabinet and become First Lord of the Admiralty, but it is rumored that Hoare will become Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, replacing Malcolm MacDonald, while MacDonald will be transferred to Colonial Secretary. It is also rumored that Minister of Public Works Gore hopes to become First Lord of the Admiralty, but some also say that the position of Colonial Secretary will belong to Gore. Before Thomas published his report at the inquiry into the budget leak, he wrote to the Prime Minister to resign. Prime Minister Baldwin replied in a very sincere letter, accepting his resignation, praising his achievements, and stating, "If I were in your position, I would also have to resign." Thomas was affiliated with the Labour Party and had served in the cabinet for many years. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) The government has today accepted the resignation of Colonial Secretary Thomas, which was submitted to Prime Minister Baldwin on the 20th of this month, stating, "Before the report of the special court is published, I must resign. I have made this decision because my reputation and my private affairs have been implicated, and it is no longer appropriate for me to be a government official. Not only can I not contribute to the cabinet, but I am also a burden to it. I have no intention of hindering a fair and complete investigation, as this matter concerns public affairs. I sincerely hope that you and my former colleagues will lead the way and guide the people out of the current difficulties." Prime Minister Baldwin replied, "I am very sorry to receive your resignation. The people will never forget your five years of effort for the national government." (National News dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) The News Chronicle recently commented on the resignation of Colonial Secretary Thomas, stating, "There are currently four members of the National Labour Party in the cabinet, Thomas being one of them (the other three being Lord President of the Council MacDonald, Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Malcolm MacDonald, and Minister of Labour Ernest Brown). His position in the party is second only to Lord President of the Council MacDonald. Now that he has retired, it will not be easy to find a successor. The Baldwin cabinet has already been shaken, and now that Thomas has resigned, the cabinet's position is even more vulnerable." (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) The morning newspapers' criticism of the resignation of Colonial Secretary Thomas is very cautious, as the investigation into the budget leak is still underway. However, all newspapers detailed Thomas's life story. The Times stated that anyone paying attention to the progress of the investigation had long expected Thomas to resign, but this does not mean that the outcome of the investigation will necessarily be unfavorable to Thomas. Thomas's voluntary resignation in compliance with constitutional customs and honor means that the foundation of political power is now broader than before, and the standards of conduct for cabinet members are also stricter than before. When a politician's name and private affairs are the subject of public discussion, they cannot cling to their position. Business in insurance and trade is inherently innocent for private individuals, but it is naturally considered a breach of discipline for cabinet members. The Daily News stated that Thomas's resignation was very appropriate. It is not a good example for a cabinet member's private affairs to be criticized. However, Thomas is a representative of the national unity Labour Party, and it will be difficult to find a replacement. The Daily Mail stated that Thomas's departure was a major blow to the government. Since Snowden left the cabinet, Thomas was the only member who had previously been a leader of the socialist party and could win the approval of the Labour Party. Now that Thomas has left, the so-called national unity Labour Party no longer exists. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) The resigned Colonial Secretary Thomas is an outstanding figure in modern British politics. He came from humble origins. At the age of nine, he was a delivery boy in a pharmacy in his hometown of Newport, Wales. At the age of ten, he was a railway worker, specializing in cleaning locomotives. Later, due to hard work, he was promoted to driver. In 1910, he was elected chairman of the Railway Workers' Union. In the same year, he was elected to the House of Commons in Derby. He soon became a leader in the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party. Before and during the European War, his influence grew, and he became an important political figure. In 1924, he joined MacDonald's first Labour cabinet, succeeding the Duke of Devonshire as Colonial Secretary. In 1929, when MacDonald formed his second cabinet, Thomas again served as Minister of Labour, devoting himself to the issue of unemployment relief. The following year, he was transferred to Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. During his tenure, he negotiated with the authorities of the Irish Free State to discuss issues such as swearing allegiance to the British monarch and paying land annuities. His task was extremely difficult. When the MacDonald cabinet experienced a cabinet crisis, namely the split within the Labour Party, when MacDonald came out to form a national cabinet, Thomas decided to follow his long-time political friend and sever ties with the opposition Labour Party. Therefore, members of the opposition Labour Party expressed extreme dissatisfaction with him and launched fierce attacks on him. He had no choice but to resign from his position as political secretary of the Railway Workers' Union. In the national cabinet, since 1931, he first served as Colonial Secretary, and in November 1934, he was transferred to Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. In 1935, after the general election last winter, he was re-appointed as Colonial Secretary until now. He is now 63 years old and has been in politics for 26 years since being elected to the House of Commons in 1910. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>French Radical Party Supports New Socialist Cabinet; Future Prime Minister Advocates Franco-American Cooperation</h3>
<p>(Paris) At a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Radical Socialist Party last night, party leader Daladier proposed a motion advocating "giving the left-wing Popular Front cabinet complete and loyal assistance." After brief discussions by the committee members, it was passed by a vote of all but one. It was 10:40 PM. The left-wing Popular Front is composed of the Orthodox Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Radical Socialist Party, and the Republican Socialist Union. Since the election results were announced, Orthodox Socialist Party leader Léon Blum, in his capacity as future Prime Minister, invited the Communist Party and the General Confederation of Labour to join the cooperation. The Communist Party refused, arguing that political enemies might take the opportunity to attack and harm the cabinet. The General Confederation of Labour agreed to cooperate in the national economic committee and various technical agencies but also refused to join the cabinet. Thus, the future cabinet will be composed of the Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party, with the support of other parties on the left. In the new Chamber of Deputies, with a total of 618 seats, the Socialist Party holds 146 seats, the Radical Socialist Party holds 116 seats, the Communist Party holds 82 seats, and the Republican Socialist Union holds 26 seats, totaling no less than 370 seats. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Orthodox Socialist Party leader and future Prime Minister Léon Blum recently delivered a radio address to the American people, explaining that the peoples of the United States and France must act in complete unity on current major issues. He said, "The recent election results in the French Chamber of Deputies show that the left-wing Popular Front has achieved a great victory. This move has three meanings: 1. Republican political democracy, civil liberties, and personal freedoms have been victorious, and all forms of autocratic politics, oligarchy, and fascism have been defeated. 2. We are determined to find appropriate methods along new paths to salvage the state of economic depression and alleviate the suffering of the people. This determination must be unwavering. 3. As far as France is concerned, we must establish a relationship of solidarity and unity among the countries of the world based on the rule of international law and principles of fairness, and promote general disarmament in order to safeguard peace in Europe and throughout the world. In short, the task of the future French cabinet is none other than to implement the aspirations of the French people." (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Soviet Aviator Completes Arctic Ocean Flight; Further Exploration of the North Pole Planned</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet hero Vodopyanov has completed a round-trip flight from Moscow to Franz Josef Land, spending a total of 75 hours in the air, covering approximately 9,000 kilometers. Schmidt, director of the Northern Sea Route Administration, made the following statement to newspaper reporters: "Vodopyanov's flight completes the glorious era of Soviet aviation controlling the Arctic Ocean. Soviet aviators have been flying north since 1924-25. Since then, we dare say that there is no place in the entire Soviet Union where Soviet aircraft cannot soar. Vodopyanov and Kokkinaki were the first to cross the Barents Sea and reach Franz Josef Land, and they flew during a period of rampant ice and snow. We can now prepare to study the central Arctic region and reach the North Pole, because Arctic Ocean traffic is becoming increasingly frequent, and accurate knowledge of ice movement, cyclone origins, and other phenomena is needed."

<h3>Economic Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Edited by Tang Qingzeng</p>
<h3>Financial Problems in Extraordinary Times (1)</h3>
<p>— Ma Yinchu</p>
<p>International winds and clouds are extremely urgent, and war could break out at any moment. China will inevitably be drawn into the vortex. How should we raise funds financially? It is particularly necessary to have prior discussions and preparations to avoid digging a well only when thirsty, so that we can manage with ease and in an orderly manner, without the disadvantage of being flustered. I will discuss this in seven points:</p>
<p>The Necessity of Stabilizing People's Hearts</p>
<p>In the event of a war between China and foreign countries, the counties and cities along the Yangtze River and the coast will bear the brunt. The finances at that time will not be the same as peacetime finances, and the economy at that time will not be the same as peacetime economy. All systems will be extremely strained. At this time, the most important thing is to stabilize people's hearts. If people's hearts can be stabilized, panic will not arise. If panic does not arise, society will not be chaotic. This kind of stable mentality must be cultivated in peacetime. It is very difficult to deal with it on a temporary basis. What is the way to cultivate it? Before the war begins, preparations should be made for economic mobilization as early as possible. After the war, all undertakings will be destroyed beyond repair, and we must quickly seek their restoration. The difficulty is even greater than during mobilization. Therefore, during mobilization, we should also take into account the difficulties of restoration, so that we can respond to each other from beginning to end and achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>China's Financial System is Not Conducive to War</p>
<p>China's financial system is indeed not conducive to war, because almost all taxes are composed of indirect taxes. The burden of indirect taxes is relatively heaviest on the poor. For example, customs duties, salt taxes, and consolidated taxes are the main sources of central revenue, and none of them are indirect taxes. Cloth, rice, wheat, etc. are all subject to customs duties. The poor consume no less than the rich. Although luxury goods are also taxed, they are ultimately limited. The same is true for salt tax. The proportion of the poor's consumption of salt in their food expenditure is much larger than that of the rich. This is also the case for matches, cement, cigarettes, flour, cotton yarn, etc. that are subject to the consolidated tax. Therefore, the burden of indirect taxes is heaviest on the poor. Once a war breaks out, not only can the tax rate not be increased on this basis, because the people's burden cannot be increased any further, but also the inherent income will be sharply reduced. For example, customs duties, at that time, the ports will inevitably be blockaded by the enemy in various ways. Won't import and export trade be greatly reduced? Since trade is greatly reduced, how can we expect tax revenue not to be reduced? Salt production is mainly concentrated in the coastal areas, which will become important war zones at that time. Whether we have enough salt to eat is still a question. How can there still be a large amount of salt tax revenue? The same is true for consolidated taxes. How can such a tax system cope with war? On the contrary, if direct taxation is the center of the tax system, the situation is exactly the opposite. Income tax and inheritance tax are both excellent direct taxes. Their burden increases cumulatively according to the degree of wealth. If a war breaks out, even if the burden is increased to 60% or 70% of income, it will not be considered harsh. National property will not be concealed or reduced for a while. Therefore, the increase in tax revenue can meet the government's expectations. This is called the flexibility of tax revenue. Any tax system with this kind of flexibility is quite sufficient to cope with war. China really has nothing. If we actively reform the current tax system to make it on par with the tax systems of civilized countries, it may not be possible to do it in a short period of time, because to implement income tax, we must first make people aware of the meaning of income tax and develop habits so that it is easy to promote. For example, when we had an income tax that was part of the party's income, we felt quite unhappy at the beginning, but now that the habit has become natural, we have forgotten about it indifferently. If the general public does not know what income tax is at all, the resistance will be great if it is suddenly implemented. This is one difficulty. As for inheritance tax, property registration should be done first. How can it be completed in one or two years? The existence of concessions provides a haven for concealing property. If we implement inheritance tax, there is even a risk of promoting property evasion. If we issue public bonds, in European and American countries, in terms of the amount of war expenses, the proportion of public bonds is always the largest, because it is faster to raise funds than taxes, and the disadvantages are not as great as the indiscriminate issuance of paper money. However, China's issuance of public bonds is not the same. Since the interest on public bonds is high, those who buy public bonds are all people with property. The fund for repaying the principal and interest in the future relies on tax revenue, and the burden of the indirect tax system is heaviest on the common people. Is this not the same as increasing the sacrifice of the poor and giving the rich an opportunity to make a fortune during the war if we issue public bonds? Therefore, China's wartime issuance of public bonds is unfair. Today, the Chinese government's finances can be called the finances of public bonds. It only knows how to borrow new debts to repay old debts and prolong its life. China's stock exchange can be called the stock exchange of public bonds, because there is no trading of company stocks and bonds, but only the proliferation of public bonds. The depth of the drawbacks of public bonds is already so great. How can it be issued again?</p>
<p>The Authenticity of Military Supplies</p>
<p>Then, does this mean that China cannot fight a war? That is not the case. What is called tax is, in form, the money that the government collects from the people, but what the government actually needs is not money, but things that can be obtained with money. Airplanes, guns, and other military supplies cannot be obtained without money. That is why the need for money is so urgent. If the same things can be obtained without money, then the existence of money is not a problem. For example, the conscription system in various countries during wartime allows the government to legally requisition any goods produced or owned by the people that can be used by the government during wartime. In this way, even if the government has no money, if the people have sufficient military supplies, the government can still fight. Therefore, even after the French Revolution, when the national treasury was empty and its vitality had not recovered, the French Prime Minister Napoleon was still able to support a large-scale war. None of the Balkan countries is free from financial difficulties, and they also engaged in long-term wars. During the Boer War, the poor and weak Boer people were able to fiercely resist Britain for as long as three years. All of these are models for us to follow. Before the Great War, Germany prepared 160 million marks in cash, believing that it would be sufficient. Who knew that once the war started, it would cost 60 million marks every day. This meager reserve was only enough for three days. Therefore, even if the budget has hundreds of millions of reserve funds, it is truly insignificant in terms of wartime needs, but it was able to support the war for as long as four years. What did it rely on? In short, it relied on the human and material resources of its people. If there can be sufficient preparation of human and material resources, even if the government's finances are very strained, it is not a cause for concern.</p>

<h3>A Large Group of Austrian Social Democrats Attempted to Rob Arms, Repelled by Police. One National Socialist Killed, One Wounded, Eight Arrested. Some Say the Goal Was to Assassinate Starhemberg</h3>
<p>(Vienna) The mansion of Prince Starhemberg, former Deputy Chancellor of the city of Lasenburg in Upper Austria, was suddenly attacked this morning at one o'clock by twelve members of the National Socialist Party. The police had heard about it beforehand and had been prepared in the mansion. When the rioters attacked, a fight broke out immediately, killing one rioter on the spot and seriously injuring another. Eight were arrested, and their leader and another party member escaped. The police suffered no casualties. According to the arrested criminals, they believed that Prince Starhemberg's mansion contained a batch of arms, so they came to rob it. After the incident, the entire province of Upper Austria, especially the Linz area, was greatly shaken. (Havas telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) According to a public statement issued today by Mr. Fortella, Director of Public Security of Upper Austria, a conflict occurred between members of the National Socialist Party and the police in the square of Starhemberg's mansion in Waxenburg, Upper Austria. One National Socialist was killed and one was wounded. This incident has caused various rumors, saying that someone attempted to assassinate Mr. Starhemberg but failed, and then a conflict occurred. Mr. Starhemberg is the leader of the Heimwehr (Austrian Fascist Party) and was dismissed from the post of Deputy Chancellor. He is naturally dissatisfied with the National Socialist Party. It is reported that Mr. Starhemberg was not in the mansion at the time. The public statement also stated that a large group of National Socialists broke into the mansion last night, their purpose was clearly to rob the Heimwehr's arms, as they all believed that these arms were stored in the mansion. The police intervened, and the National Socialists immediately opened fire. The police also returned fire and arrested eight National Socialists. The police in Upper Austria are now ordered to be on alert to prevent the activities of the National Socialist Party or the Heimwehr's resistance demonstrations. (Reuters telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Vienna) The mansion of Deputy Chancellor Prince Starhemberg was suddenly attacked by members of the National Socialist Party. It is now known that the headquarters of the Patriotic Defense League had been receiving phone calls from outside since the day before yesterday, asking where the Prince was. The intention was to know in advance that if the Prince was in the mansion when they made their move this morning, his guards would inevitably come out to resist. Otherwise, the personnel in the mansion would be weak and not worth paying attention to. In short, the actions of the National Socialists were a public rebellion and should be dealt with by a special court. (Havas telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Vienna) After Chancellor Schuschnigg ordered the reorganization of various paramilitary groups into civilian groups, Ulman, the head of the Heimwehr branch in the western Vorarlberg province, recently published a notice in various newspapers, stating that the Heimwehr should occupy a special position in the civilian groups, and the local Patriotic Defense League should retain its original armaments until the Heimwehr's established political program is fully realized when the civilian groups are completed. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Political figures recently commented on the case of the National Socialists attacking Prince Starhemberg's mansion, saying that it was planned by the central party headquarters and was not a local event. The party's intention was to use the excuse of local unrest to oppose the disarmament of the Heimwehr, focusing on causing disturbances in Upper Austria to prove that the police were unable to stop the assassination of Prince Starhemberg. (Havas telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Diplomatic circles here stated today that Austria's current political strife is a major crisis for the future of peace in Europe. If the Heimwehr is forced to disband, the Heimwehr soldiers will become a major base for German propaganda. If they believe that it is impossible to nationalize Austria internally, they will turn to Berlin for instructions. Diplomats recently recalled from Vienna claim that the revolution of the Austrian National Socialist Party will inevitably lead to Italian intervention, as Prime Minister Mussolini is determined not to have a large German federation superior to Italy, and even when Mr. Mussolini used troops in Africa, he did not forget to deploy several divisions of troops on Italy's northern border, as if to say that if the National Socialist Party brews a revolution in Austria to make it a possession of the leader Hitler, Italy will take action. It is also said here that Czechoslovakia believes that Austria's restoration movement is sufficient to hinder its own security, so if Austria takes the path of restoration, Czechoslovakia will take military action to stop it. Therefore, today's Austria is a powder keg in Europe. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Italy Reinforces Border Defenses, Austrian Border Reservists Ordered Back to Camp</h3>
<p>(Rome) After the mansion of former Austrian Deputy Chancellor Prince Starhemberg was attacked by members of the National Socialist Party, the reservists stationed in various Italian border areas near Austria were recently ordered to return to camp. (Havas telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is rumored that the Italian border troops near Austria have recently taken special measures to strengthen defenses, which is quite inaccurate. In fact, after a portion of the troops stationed in those areas were transferred to Abyssinia for combat, the government has sent an equal number of troops to fill the defense, and the number of personnel has not decreased as a result. However, the soldiers belonging to this filling force, who arrived in the defense area in November of last year, have requested long leave for reasons such as returning to their hometown to farm, etc., and the military commanders in charge have all approved them. Now, these soldiers have been ordered to return to camp. Other than this, the government has not taken any other actions. (Havas telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>Albania's Capital</p>
<p>According to news from Greece, most parts of Albania are constructing defense works under the supervision of Italian military officers. Officials here have firmly denied this and said that the rumor that a large number of military supplies are being shipped to domestic ports every day is also untrue. (Havas telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3>An Albanian Bishop Briefly Ordered to Leave the Country, Now Order Rescinded</h3>
<p>(Paris) Assistant Bishop Yaluosha of the Albanian province of Qielasi (French), was previously ordered to leave the country by the local Italian army. After French Ambassador to Italy Chamberlin made representations to the Italian government, the authorities of that country have now decided to rescind the order and not expel him. Yaluosha is elderly and has lived in the Albanian city of Halaal for more than forty years. He often earnestly rescues and cares for local lepers and is greatly loved by the local people. (Havas telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Father Garoso, who was stationed in Halaal for twenty years, was ordered by the Italian military authorities on May 19 to be expelled from Abyssinia. The Italian government has now issued an order to suspend the implementation of this order. It is investigated that 40 years ago, the Albanian Emperor Minilik issued an order to expel the priest, and later cancelled this order. This time, the Italian military authorities accused the priest of engaging in anti-Italian activities and specially excluded him. France was indignant because of this. To avoid hurting French feelings, the Italian government issued an order to suspend the implementation of the military authorities' order. (Reuters telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>U.S.-Philippine Economic Relations Should Be Improved</h3>
<p>(Washington) Ho Ruoman, a famous Philippine mining magnate and spokesman for American commerce in Manila, declared today that the independence of the Philippines is now a foregone conclusion. He will henceforth strive to improve the economic status of the Philippines. After Qi Xie, the US Chief Officer stationed in the Philippines, tried his best to overturn the Adams Act, Ho said that the United States should morally and legally compensate the Philippines for the 23,800,000 yuan lost due to the devaluation of the American currency in the Philippines. Furthermore, the US has extracted 30,000,000 yuan in sales tax from Philippine coconut oil in six years. I will also examine this issue so that it can be returned to the Philippines as soon as possible. Finally, Ho left here today to go to Cleveland to prepare to chair the Philippine delegation at the Republican National Convention. National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Prevents and Eliminates Kala-azar, Trains Primary Medical Service Personnel in Rural Areas</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang The kala-azar epidemic in northern Jiangsu is spreading in Lianshui, Siyang, Suqian, Huai'an, Huaiyin, Bao'ying, Fu'ning, Shuyang, Sui'ning, Tongshan, Haizhou, Guanyun, Pi County, Pei County, Xiaoshan, Feng County, Dangshan, and other counties, and the situation is very rampant. It is a major problem in northern Jiangsu. In order to prevent and eliminate the disease, the provincial government has specially trained primary medical service personnel in rural areas by the Provincial Medical and Political College. Now, the first group of 58 people has graduated and formed the Huaiyin District Kala-azar Prevention and Treatment Team, consisting of one general team and ten sub-teams. Each sub-team has five prevention and treatment stations, and each station is staffed by one service person to carry out prevention and treatment work. The general team is located in Lian, and a sub-team is set up at the appropriate location. Three sub-teams are set up in Su and Si respectively, and one sub-team is set up in Huai'an and Bao'ying respectively. It is stipulated that the general team will have 50 outpatient visits per day, and each prevention and treatment station under the sub-team will have 30 outpatient visits. All expenses have been included in the budget for the 25th year and will be implemented immediately. From then on, the eradication of kala-azar in northern Jiangsu can be expected. (Central News Agency telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Large Power Plant to be Established in Huaiyin</h3>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The Jiangsu Construction Department will establish a large power plant in the Huaiyin area in Huaiyin. The plant site has been determined to be the old copper coin bureau, and technician Zhu Yaonian and others have been sent to Pu to prepare for it. Power will be released on July 1 after the machinery is installed. Sub-plants will be set up in six counties including Huaian and Lianshui. (Central News Agency telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Order</h3>
<p>National Government Order of the 23rd, appointing Gao Shuangcheng as the commander of the 86th Division. This order,</p>
<h3>Rural Miscellaneous Writings in Hubei, Special Correspondent Cheng Jun of This Newspaper</h3>
<p>Waiting for a car in Suixian, I stayed for five days. Although Fu Wei was not yet pacified, the villages within ten li were still accessible due to the garrison of the 82nd Division. I took advantage of this opportunity to enter the rural villages and fields several times and talked about sericulture with the elderly farmers from morning to night. I feel that the aforementioned rural situation still has some points that have not been fully described, so I will supplement them below. The farmland in the county is measured in stone dou, with every two dou being one mu. The amount of grain paid by tenant farmers is divided into three types: six dou, five dou, and four dou. Top-grade land is one dou, (i.e. half a mu) and completes six dou, middle-grade land completes five dou, and low-grade land completes four dou. If the year is poor, the grain will be reduced proportionately. For example, if the harvest is 60%, top-grade land should complete six dou of grain, but only completes three dou six sheng, middle-grade land should complete five dou, but only completes three dou, and low-grade land is also calculated according to the percentage. All are paid in rice, and can also be offset by seed cotton, sesame, wheat, and beans. It is also stipulated that seed cotton is offset at 33 jin, sesame at 3 dou 3 sheng, and wheat and beans at 6 dou per shi of grain. There is no dispute. The grain payment period is after the autumn harvest, but if the landlords lack food, they can borrow wheat from the tenant farmers during the spring harvest, which is similar to advance payment. The land is completely converted into money, and very few pay rent in cotton and wheat. Regardless of the land, there is a "topping," which is a prepayment of 20 strings per dou of land, and the price is the same. Although this silver will still be returned to the tenant farmers in the future, if they borrow money to cultivate the land, calculated at the lowest interest rate of two percent, they will invisibly lose four strings each year. The tenant farmers provide the plowing cattle, seeds, implements, and fertilizer themselves. But if we calculate the amount of harvesting and planting, then each field is one shi, and in a good year, we can harvest 20 shi of grain. Assuming that each shi is worth 3.5 yuan, we can get 70 yuan. We can harvest 5 shi of wheat, and each shi is worth 5 yuan, so we can get 25 yuan. The grain payment is only 20 yuan, and consumption is 20 yuan, so we can get an income of 45 yuan. The rights and obligations are roughly equal. The farmers do not complain about this, but feel that there are too many miscellaneous exploitations, which they cannot afford. For example, the pao-chia expenses are stipulated by the government to be at most 5 yuan per pao, but in reality, it often exceeds this amount. Those with standing volunteer teams must also make separate payments.</p>
<p>The relationship between tenant farmers and landlords, in addition to paying grain and rent and the aforementioned "selling of rent," there is also the so-called "collapsing of grain," that is, when the landlord needs money, he borrows it from the tenant farmers. Depending on the amount of money, the amount of "collapsed grain" is agreed upon. In the future, the amount "collapsed" will not need to be completed, and the grain tax will still be borne by the landlord. This method is neither a pawn nor a sale, and is inversely proportional to "selling rent," but selling rent is disadvantageous to tenant farmers, and this is the landlord's business.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 12th, I took a bus north from Sui. At noon, I passed Zaoyang. Because of the urgent time, I could only make a two-hour visit. The rural situation I heard can be described in general. There is little farmland and much land in the county, which is measured in mu instead of stone dou. Five square feet is one bu, and 240 square bu is one mu. Top-grade land can produce 2 shi of rice, 1 dou 2 sheng of wheat, and the next-best can produce 2 shi to 2 shi 5 dou of rice, and 8-9 dou of wheat. Top-grade land produces 120-130 jin of cotton per mu, 8-9 dou of wheat, and the next-best produces 50-60 jin of cotton, 5-6 dou of wheat, and 1 shi of sorghum. There is more farmland in the southeast countryside. The land is worth 20 to 30 yuan per mu, and the land price is 35 yuan per mu. The tenant-landlord relationship is completely based on the field-sharing system. For example, if the field produces 1 shi of rice, the landlord and tenant each get 5 dou, and if the land produces 100 jin of cotton, the landlord and tenant each get 50 jin. There are as many as three procedures for this. One is "division face to face." After the rice and wheat are harvested, they are piled on the threshing floor. The landlords and tenants all come to the floor. If it is 1 shi, they each divide 5 dou. The second is "looking at the grain." When the rice and wheat are ripening, the tenant farmers invite the landlords to come and survey in person, determine how much rice and wheat can be produced, and then agree on the rent and grain. In general, for paddy fields, 1 dou, if there is no disaster, you must pay 8 dou of grain, 2 dou of wheat, and dry land is discounted at 2 to 4 yuan. The third is "welcoming the grain." The previous year, the money was first converted and the next year's rent was paid in advance. The former is divided into two times in spring and autumn, and the latter is only once in the autumn harvest. Tenant farmers have the obligation to help the landlords with work and send firewood, and the landlords have the responsibility to handle plowing cattle, seeds, and fertilizers for the tenant farmers. Farmland has a "topping" but land does not. Previously, because there was little farmland and many people, tenant farmers competed to cultivate, and were willing to increase the "topping" to the landlords. As a result, the income from blood and sweat was not enough to repay the interest on the "topping." When the snipe and clam fight, the fisherman benefits. Now, after the disasters and banditry, a large number of young men have died, and the situation has changed to one with more farmland and fewer people. Those with farmland can no longer live as a rare commodity, so the "topping" is gradually reduced, and even the obligations such as helping with work are invisibly reduced. However, there are still not a few farmlands that are left uncultivated. The lives of farmers are extremely difficult. Rice is regarded as a treasure, and wheat is also left for sale outside the village, and they dare not taste it easily. Most of them eat sorghum as粑 or with gravy, which tastes very astringent and cannot be swallowed. They wear tattered clothes, and their residences are thatched huts, which are inferior to the farmers in Suixian. Cotton is a major export commodity, and the depleted rural economy relies on it for adjustment.</p>

<h3>Lecture Three on Chemistry: History of Chemistry Development in China (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Chen Kezhong, Full-time Translator, National Institute for Compilation and Translation</p>
<p>Although chemistry is one of the modern sciences, the application of many chemical methods, such as brewing, metallurgy, leather making, dyeing, and ceramics manufacturing, were already known to humans four or five thousand years ago. In the world, besides Egypt, China has one of the longest histories of chemistry. However, modern chemistry came from Europe. To discuss the history of chemistry development in China, it is best to first briefly describe the evolution in Europe. On one hand, we can make a comparison between the histories of Chinese and Western chemistry. On the other hand, through comparison, everyone can understand how we should work hard to shoulder the responsibility of carrying on the past and opening up the future. The history of chemical evolution in Europe can be roughly divided into three periods:</p>
<p>The first is the period of alchemy—starting from the third century AD, with no significant development for a long time, only beginning to flourish after the fourth century. This continued until around 1500 AD, when it came to an end. The main purpose of alchemy was to turn base metals into precious metals. Although the ideals of the alchemists of this period were absurd, some of them were willing to work hard to explore various things. This courageous spirit is worthy of admiration by later generations.</p>
<p>The second is the period of medicinal chemistry—starting around the beginning of the sixteenth century and flourishing after the seventeenth century. This period was short, only about two hundred years. The main purpose of medicinal chemistry was to extract natural substances for health preservation and disease treatment. Although the theories of this period were still not very valuable, the experiments were relatively close to reality, so chemical inventions gradually increased.</p>
<p>The third is the period of modern chemistry—from the end of the eighteenth century to the present, which can be said to be the period of modern chemistry. Chemists in this period do not engage in meaningless dreams; all academic theories are based on facts and experiments. Therefore, the progress of modern chemistry is particularly rapid, and there are particularly many inventions. Compared with the two periods of alchemy and medicinal chemistry, although the time ratio is one to ten, the degree of progress and practical contribution are vastly different.</p>
<p>The above is the evolution of the history of chemistry in Europe. As for the process of chemical evolution in China, it is roughly similar to that in Europe, but the division of eras is not as clear as in Europe. Moreover, the two periods of alchemy and medicinal chemistry had a tendency to progress simultaneously for a long time. However, for the sake of convenience in research, we can also divide it into three periods. From the late Zhou dynasty to the Tang dynasty can be said to be the period of alchemy. From the Song to the Ming and Qing dynasties can be said to be the period of medicinal chemistry. From the late Qing dynasty to the present can be said to be the period of modern chemistry. To trace the history of chemistry in Europe, we can only talk about the origin of alchemy. But in China, before alchemy, there was a long and glorious prehistory that is worthy of our attention. For example, in the "Kao Gong Ji" (The Book of Diverse Crafts) of the early Zhou dynasty, the records about the use of alloying methods to manufacture various utensils are not only numerous but also very detailed. If we trace further back, there are the bronzes of the Yin dynasty, and further back, there are Shennong's herbs. These are all good materials for studying chemistry. Even in terms of alchemy, there are famous works in this category. Before there was Wei Boyang's "Cantong qi" (The Kinship of the Three), and after there was Ge Hong's "Baopuzi" (Master Who Embraces Simplicity). The name Ge Hong is probably known to everyone who has been to Hangzhou and visited Geling. Although he was more than two hundred years later than Wei Boyang, his "Baopuzi", in terms of the era, was more than a hundred years earlier than the most prosperous period of alchemy in Europe. As for its content, it cannot be compared with the alchemy in Europe at that time. Of course, our past glorious history of chemistry is not limited to this. Everyone knows that papermaking and gunpowder were invented in our country. These two inventions are very important. In addition, there is our ceramics, which was particularly outstanding in the Ming and Qing dynasties. At that time, many European countries tried hard to imitate it, but they never achieved their goals. From these facts, we have two points to be proud of. First, our chemistry before modern times was independently produced by our country; second, our early chemistry not only has a longer history than others, but also has better achievements than others. But now, compared with European and American countries, our chemistry is really too far behind. Now, I will talk to you about the reasons why modern chemistry in our country is not developed, and the hopes for the future:</p>
<p>Modern chemistry in our country was imported from Europe and America. The era when European and American chemistry was imported into our country was similar to the era when it was imported into Japan, roughly in the first year of Tongzhi. At that time, the Qing government established the Tongwen Guan (College of Foreign Languages) in Beijing and began to translate chemistry books. A few years later, the Jiangnan Manufacturing Bureau was established and an translation office was attached to it, which published a large number of chemistry books. Now I will list the names of these books, and you can imagine how hard the Jiangnan Manufacturing Bureau worked to introduce Western chemistry at that time:</p>
<p>About Chemistry: "The Origins of Chemistry" in four volumes, "Chemical Technology" in twelve volumes, "Table of Chinese and Western Names of Chemical Materials," "Chemical Mirror" in six volumes, "Chemical Principles" in eight volumes, "Chemical Supplement" in six volumes, "Chemical Examination" in eight volumes, "Chemical Calculation" in fifteen volumes.</p>
<p>About Military Engineering: "Methods of Making Gunpowder" in three volumes, "Essentials of Explosives" in six volumes, "New Book on Nitroglycerin Explosives" in ten volumes.</p>
<p>About Agricultural Science: "Questions and Answers on Agricultural Chemistry" in two volumes, "Simple Methods of Agricultural Chemistry" in three volumes, "Complete Book of Agriculture" in thirty-two volumes (one-third involves chemistry), "Agricultural Theory" in three volumes (the first volume is mostly about chemistry).</p>
<p>About Mining: "Metallurgical Records" in three volumes, "Where Treasures Arise" in twelve volumes (discussing metals), "Methods of Prospecting for Gold and Stones" in four volumes (Chapters 10 to 17 discuss chemical metals), "Examination of Mineral Properties" in ten volumes.</p>

<h3>Tian Dai's Diplomatic Policy Towards North China After Taking Office: Cancellation of the Puppet East Hebei Government Is Extremely Difficult; Formal Diplomatic Negotiations Will Begin Next Month</h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Since Song Zheyuan's return to Peiping, although Xiao Zhenying has continued to hold talks with Yongjian, the staff officer of the Japanese Garrison Army in Tianjin, and Lin, the staff officer, and Chen Zhongfu has also contacted Lin, because it is the period for the handover of new and old officials of Tada and Tashiro, Yongjian and others have said that most of them are just empty promises, and when they are asked about the reality, they evade the question. Therefore, up to now, it has almost come to a standstill. On the day Tian Dai took office as commander, he talked to Japanese reporters, saying, "It is rumored that the Japanese side is changing its policy towards North China due to the change of commanders of the Japanese Garrison Army in North China. This is absolutely impossible. The Japanese side is determined to move forward based on its consistent policy. Canceling the East Hebei government is impossible because the Hebei-Chahar regime is not yet stable and has not yet fully realized autonomy. Before these two things are done, it is too early to talk about cancellation, regardless of whether it is a merger or a revocation." From these few words, we can clearly understand what diplomatic policy the Japanese side will hold in the future. The Hebei-Chahar authorities have devoted all their efforts to diplomatic issues in the past two weeks, hoping for a quick decision. However, there are many complications and unpredictable situations. Tada, Matsumuro, and Yongjian agreed to cancel the East Hebei puppet government. Suddenly, the military officers in Peiping and Tianjin and the staff of the headquarters of the Japanese Garrison Army united in opposition. Just as the military officers' and staff's prejudices were about to be dispelled, objections came from the Kwantung Army, which led to the diplomacy being like a mirage, visible but not immediately attainable. Matsumuro Takayoshi left for Changchun on the sixteenth and told the Hebei-Chahar authorities before leaving that he was exchanging opinions with the Kwantung Army to seek a unified position and would talk again after Commander Tashiro took office. Now that Tashiro has taken office, Matsumuro returned to Tianjin from Changchun on the nineteenth, but has not yet formally contacted the Hebei-Chahar authorities. On the twentieth and twenty-first, Tashiro twice summoned the officers and staff of his troops at the Japanese military headquarters in Haiguang Temple and Zhang Tuan's residence to give instructions after taking office, conveying the military's fixed intentions on the major period of the North China situation and the diplomatic policy to be held with Hebei-Chahar. Matsumuro, Yongjian, Ishii, etc., reported on the current situation of the North China Anti-Communist Military and the diplomatic situation. However, this is a general discussion of affairs. Important negotiation steps must wait for the decision of the military officers' meeting next week. The meeting is scheduled to be held on the 27th or 28th, with Tashiro himself as the center. After the decision is made, formal negotiations will begin next month. At that time, if Song does not come to Tianjin, Xiao will go to Peiping to contact Matsumuro nearby. The target of future negotiations is whether to take the meaning of the North China military officers and garrison army represented by Tashiro as the meaning, or respect the opinions of the Japanese Kwantung Army, combine the two sides, and create a plan to ask us for exchange conditions for a "relative solution." At the moment, the Japanese side's intentions have not yet been revealed. Matsumuro returned Tada to Japan on the twenty-second, attended a meeting of the Garrison Army on the twenty-third, and returned to Peiping on the twenty-fourth. Before the formal negotiations, he will meet informally with Xiao Zhenying and Chen Zhongfu. Tashiro will go to Peiping at the end of the month to review the army and meet with Song Zheyuan, and will also make some statements. Whether the Hebei-Chahar authorities agree to start diplomatic negotiations within the scope formulated by the Japanese side also remains to be seen. Recently, due to the strengthening of the Japanese army in North China and the change of commanders of the Japanese Garrison Army, diplomacy has not yet been developed, and the situation is quite tense for a while. There are also many rumors between Tianjin and Peiping, but according to important people responsible for diplomacy, "The negotiations on the Hebei-Chahar issue have come to an end. Although there are still many obstacles ahead and it is difficult to resolve quickly, future negotiations will continue to be based on the previous contact procedures and will never erase everything and overturn the previous agreement and start anew. Perhaps there will be disagreements between the opinions of both sides, and the situation will tend to deteriorate, but it will also be superficial. The Japanese side will not suddenly change its face and take any action." The East Hebei puppet organization was originally on its last breath and about to disappear, but now, due to Tashiro's arrival, its life has been extended. Yin Rugeng personally accompanied Chi Zongmo, the secretary-general of the puppet government, Wang Xiacai, the puppet senator, Yin Tixin, the chief of the puppet Tangshan office, and Zhao Lei, the chief of the puppet Fourth Security Corps, to Tianjin on the twentieth to secretly welcome Tashiro and say goodbye to Tada, and took the opportunity to move among the new staff of the North China Garrison Army. Therefore, the future of Hebei-Chahar diplomacy is mostly ominous and less auspicious. The situation of canceling the puppet organization is the opposite of what it was two weeks ago. Even if the authorities make the greatest efforts, the result may only be to prevent the Hebei-Chahar situation from becoming more serious. (Twenty-second)</p>
<h3>Han and Kong Telegraphically Present Steps to Reorganize the Yellow River</h3>
<p>The first step requires 250,000 yuan; the second step requires 1.2 million yuan; the third step is expected to be held in the next few years</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Provincial Chairman Han Fuju and Kong Xiangrong, Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, carefully inspected the tail end and estuary of the Yellow River this time. After returning to Jinan, they immediately drafted a telegram, detailing the inspection process and reorganization plan, and telegraphed President Jiang of the Executive Yuan, requesting approval for implementation. The telegram is as follows: "To President Jiang of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing: Xiangrong came to Jinan on orders to discuss the case of Lu Province requesting dredging of the Yellow River estuary. I received your cold telegram regarding the petition of Chairman Han of Lu Province to build dikes, dredge rivers and build railways to facilitate defense and transportation, which was handed over to Rong for verification. I immediately combined the case and Rong decided to personally inspect the lower reaches of the Yellow River with Fuju in Jinan for verification. Therefore, I boarded a car from Jinan and inspected along the dike to Lijin, and then changed to a civilian ship to inspect along the river, directly to the estuary, and went out of Taiping Bay. After investigation, the tail end of the river is not smooth and there are many silt deposits along the river. The most important places are Luanjingzi, about eighty miles away from Taiping Bay, where the bend is too severe and the flow is slow and obstructed, and Shuguang Weizi below Luanjingzi, where the situation is the same. It is proposed to take the method of cutting bends and straightening at these two places, which can make the diversion return to the river, increase the scouring power of the river channel, so as to avoid siltation and smooth the river flow, and the use of funds is not much and the effect is great. It is estimated that the project is in a remote area. Fuju will organize military workers to carry out excavation on one side, and Xiangrong will send surveying and mapping personnel to plan and implement on the other side. It is proposed to ask the Central Committee to approve the funds and hand them over to the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to jointly handle the project with the Provincial Government, so as to complete it as soon as possible and benefit the river defense. This is the first step to dredge the river and reorganize the estuary, and should be held immediately. In addition, it is proposed to purchase two dredgers and all equipment in the downstream river channel and near the estuary for permanent dredging, which will cost about 1.2 million yuan. It will not only eliminate siltation and smooth the river flow, but also facilitate transportation and benefit merchants. This is proposed as the second step, and planning and preparation will be carried out at this time to wait for the autumn or next spring. After the first step of cutting bends and straightening the river flow is smooth, stone dikes will be built on both sides of the river channel with a considerable width, judging the situation and attacking sand with water, and will be handled annually in stages, gradually expanding directly to the estuary, in order to complete this fundamental reorganization of the Yellow River estuary and strive for the safety of the outlet. This is proposed as the third step, and will be planned and implemented at any time, and is expected to be completed within the next few years. In addition to the construction of dikes, the Yellow River River Affairs Bureau of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission has been ordered to formulate a plan and has sent personnel to conduct on-site surveys along the river in the three provinces of Ji, Lu and Yu to verify and handle. The construction of railways to facilitate defense and transportation has been assigned to experienced personnel of the Association in railway construction engineering to formulate a plan with the Provincial Government. All measures to dredge the river and reorganize the estuary are formulated as above in accordance with the telegram. Is it appropriate? Lihe Lei Chen Jianhe, training instructions are followed, and the first method mentioned above is an imminent move. Fu Qi quickly granted approval for implementation, I can't help but wait for the command urgently, Chairman of Shandong Provincial Government Han Fuju and Chairman of Yellow River Conservancy Commission Kong Xiangrong together knock on the horse."</p>
<h3>Grain Shortage in Rural Jiangxi Province; 70-80% of Farmers Lack Food Grain</h3>
<p>Nanchang dispatch: Jiangxi is a rich rice-producing area. No matter how barren it is, it is enough to feed itself. Even if there is a grain shortage, it is only a serious disaster area and a temporary accidental phenomenon, and there is no such widespread and serious situation as it is now. According to the province's eighty-three counties, bandit-affected areas such as Xiushui, Tonggu, Dexing, Yiyang, Lianhua, Wan'an, Ruijin, etc., have seen a sharp decline in production due to excessive population deaths and barren fields without anyone to cultivate them, and the elderly and weak have no way to obtain food. Seriously flooded areas such as Yongxiu, Pengze, Jiujiang, Poyang, etc., had their dikes collapse almost entirely last year, and this year they have suffered another catastrophe. Most of the spring plowing seeds have no source, let alone food grain. As for the most prosperous counties of Linchuan, Jinxian, Fengcheng, etc., the former mostly had enough food for each household, but now they are forced by natural and man-made disasters and the intrusion of foreign economies and the sucking of excessive taxes. The economic structure is completely broken, and no more than 20-30% of farmers have spring grain. The upper ones mortgage and borrow to make a living, and the lower ones eat grass roots and tree bark to survive. Nankang, Linchuan and other places have mostly banned the export of rice grain, while other places have calls for the circulation of rice grain, resulting in conflicting policies. The reason for this is entirely due to economic exhaustion, loss of balance and circulation. Last autumn harvest, the average price of early rice in each place with convenient transportation was between 2.22 and 2.30 yuan per dan, and the price in places with slightly difficult transportation was between 1.70 and 1.80 yuan per dan. In Ningdu and other places, some even had prices below one yuan. Farmers had to sell at reduced prices to repay loans, pay various taxes of the Baojia, and exchange for necessities, and few households had any savings. By this year, grain prices have risen sharply, and rice grain has long fallen into the hands of wealthy households and big merchants (even those who sell rice grain are rich farmers). Farmers at this time must buy rice on credit, but have no way to borrow, and can only endure hunger. At this time of serious spring famine, such as Le'an, Suichuan, Yichun, and other counties, the price of rice is between three and four yuan per dan, which is in stark contrast to the more than ten yuan per dan of rice in the two disaster-stricken areas of northeastern Jiangxi. Time and space have also become deformed, so the people are looking forward to the government having methods of adjustment and relief. (May 18)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Provincial Government Increases Land Tax in Nanchang</h3>
<p>Citizens Protest to the Central Government; Ministry of Interior Approves Revocation of the Case</p>
<p>Nanchang dispatch: In order to rectify the Nanchang City's drainage system and discharge urban sewage, the Jiangxi Provincial Government has a plan to collect land price tax as sewage fees. The method is to re-register all land in the city, whether it has been registered before or not, estimate the land price, with the average price being 7,000 to 8,000 yuan per mu for the high ones (120 yuan per square city), and 20 to 40 yuan for the low ones. After issuing the new registration certificate, tax is collected at 20/1000 of the land price, with the high ones paying more than 140 yuan per mu per year, and the low ones also paying more than 10 yuan. The citizens of the city believe that the land price tax in Shanghai and Hangzhou has not exceeded 10/1000. How can the citizens of inland commercial ports bear this? Moreover, in the past two years, the economy has shrunk and the market has been depressed to the extreme. Empty houses and closed shops are everywhere. Therefore, there should be a need to postpone the collection. They have successively petitioned the central government and the Ministry of Interior and Finance to reduce the tax rate and postpone the collection. The Ministry of Interior and Finance asked the Jiangxi Provincial Government to reduce the tax rate and revise the provisional regulations on the collection of land price tax, and consult with the Ministry for review. However, the Provincial Government believed that the matter was imperative and issued a notice No. 1880 on February 7, imposing the tax at 20/1000 and urging citizens to pay as soon as possible. Citizens Lan Dingzhong and others appealed to the central government again, and the Ministry of Interior, based on Article 2 of the Revised Provincial Government Organization Law, which stipulates that "Regarding restrictions on people's freedom and increases in people's burdens, they shall not be implemented without the approval of the National Government," revoked the original notice and tax rate issued by the Jiangxi Provincial Government and sent the decision to citizens Lan Dingzhong and others yesterday, stating that "The petitioner Lan Dingzhong and others, the respondent Jiangxi Provincial Government, etc., filed a petition in accordance with the law for dissatisfaction with the notice of the Jiangxi Provincial Government regarding the tax rate stipulated for the collection of land price tax in Nanchang City. The decision of this Ministry is as follows: The main text is: The notice issued by the Jiangxi Provincial Government regarding the collection of land price tax in Nanchang City is hereby revoked."

<h3>Nanking City Government Building Sewers</h3>
<p>The Planned Project Is Scheduled to Be Completed in Three Years; The First Phase of the Project Will Be Implemented Starting July 1</p>
<p>Nanking Dispatch: The Nanking City Government built the sewers and specially set up a sewer engineering office to carry out everything. The funds are allocated by the Dutch Gengkuan Association to provide a partial subsidy. Water pipes are buried in the south and north sections of the city. The planned project is scheduled to be completed in three years. The measurement part has been completed and it has been decided that the first phase of the project will be implemented starting July 1. The progress is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Nanking has always been an old-fashioned city, and the ditch administration has been neglected for a long time. Since the capital was established, the population has increased day by day, and the construction of houses has progressed rapidly at any time. The original ponds have gradually been filled, and rainwater and sewage have become more and more difficult to discharge. Filth and dampness are everywhere, which is extremely detrimental to the city appearance and hygiene. The establishment of sewers is urgent. In the twenty-second year, Dutch Gengkuan was used to relocate the Nanking city water conservancy, and a sewer engineering office was first established within the Bureau of Public Works to specialize in it. First, the southern part of the city was measured, with a total length of 155,000 meters. In the fall of the twenty-fourth year, the entire sewer project plan in the southern area was completed. As for the northern part of the city and Xiaguan, the measurement was also completed in September of the second year, with a total length of 21,963 meters in the northern area and 16,596 meters in the Xiaguan area, and is still in progress. The plan is that the terrain in Nanking is high in the north and low in the south, and the population is sparse in the north and dense in the south. The key to discharge is the south before the north, and the Qinhuai River runs through the south of the city. It has become a place to hide dirt and water, and washing and clarifying can be used.</p>
<p>Rainwater and sewage have two systems: separate flow and combined flow. The Nanking City Government has carefully studied this point. If the separate flow system is used, the rainwater entering the river will still carry a lot of dirt, and residents will also not be able to distinguish clearly, and will arbitrarily pour sewage into the rainwater pipe. Although it is called separation, it cannot be completely separated. If the combined flow system is used, the amount of sewage is small at ordinary times and can be diverted by the intercepting pipe. When the rain is long and the pipe is full, the water quality is diluted before overflowing into the river. Although it is called combination, the clear and turbid are clearly distinguished. Moreover, the separate flow system requires the separate installation of two kinds of water pipes for rainwater and sewage, and the engineering cost and maintenance cost are much higher than the combined flow system. Therefore, it was decided that the southern area of the city would adopt the combined flow system and another intercepting pipe would be used to analyze it, so that rainwater would be discharged into the Qinhuai River, and sewage would be pumped into iron pipes by pumping stations between the Xishimen and Hanximen gates and led to the Sanwen River to reach the river. As for the northern area of the city, it is planned to adopt the separate flow system, and research is still underway. As for the treatment of sewage, the river water dilution method is adopted. The ratio of the amount of sewage to the minimum flow of river water is 1 to 21,700. In this way, the sewage will be completely diluted and purified, and there will be no harm, and the land use cost can also be saved.</p>
<p>However, the sewer project is huge. The combined pipe part of the southern area of the city requires about 4,133,318 yuan, the intercepting pipe part requires about 824,737 yuan, and the water pipe into the river and pumping equipment, etc., require about 705,000 yuan. The total cost of the entire project is about 5,663,055 yuan, and the basic projects of intercepting pipes and water pipes into the river, which are the key points, only account for 1,529,737 yuan.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned expenses are estimated for the southern area of the city. The northern area and Xiaguan are not included. It is so huge that it is difficult to do everything at once. The Nanking City Government has given special rights to its importance and urgency and stipulated the construction procedures. The most important ones are the intercepting pipes along both banks of the Qinhuai River between Qianheyan Jingzhubridge East Water Gate and Hanximen, as well as the water pipes into the river and pumping equipment from the Hanximen and Xishimen gates to the Sanwen River mouth. This is because this is the main drainage channel and the basic project of the sewer in the city. If this part is completed in advance, the sewer pipes under the roads after this can be attached at any time, and the project can be promoted in stages according to the capacity, without affecting the entire plan. The fundamental method of clarifying the water of the Qinhuai River must also rely on this. Therefore, it is planned to complete the basic project in three years. As for the sewer pipes under the newly built roads, they will also be buried at any time. It is estimated that in the recent year, the newly opened roads and added sewer pipes by the Nanking City Bureau of Public Works include Zhongshan, Zhujiang, and Mochou Roads, etc., with 2.22 kilometers of 23 cm diameter pipes, 1.26 kilometers of 30 cm diameter pipes, 3.49 kilometers of 45 cm diameter pipes, 1.98 kilometers of 60 cm diameter pipes, 0.47 kilometers of 75 cm diameter pipes, and 0.45 kilometers of 90 cm diameter pipes, for a total of 11.87 kilometers added. This is almost half of the original length of 26.50 kilometers before the twenty-third year. As for the Xingsheng and Jiankang Roads West Section and other roads that have not yet been completed, their sewer pipes are also being buried, and the extension of the length is just beginning.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: A Murder Case Driven by Jealousy and Adultery</h3>
<p>In Qianjing Bridge North, outside the West Gate of Songjiang, lived Liu Hengtai, a migrant worker who made a living by manual labor. His family consisted of his wife, Ms. Bao, and a son named Xizi, who was 24 years old this year. Xizi had been having an affair for years with Ms. Zhang (26 years old), the wife of his fellow villager (from Dongtai), Zhou Wentang. However, Ms. Zhang was promiscuous and had relationships with many men, including one with Zong Zaihua. The husband, Zhou Wentang, was weak and henpecked, which made Ms. Zhang even more unrestrained. This gradually led to the seeds of disaster being sown. On the night of the 13th of this month, Zhou Wentang, incited by Zong Zaihua, went to Liu's house. Liu Xizi had gone out to work eight days prior, and had not returned. Liu Xizi's parents grew suspicious when rumors spread that dismembered limbs and a half-split head had been found in Miaopumian. They went to identify the body, but the face was too blurry to recognize. Consequently, they went to the Qianjing Bridge teahouse and questioned Zhou Wentang. At first, he prevaricated, but then Zhou's uncle, Zhou Guangqi, and Zhou Bao, along with seven others, intervened and arranged for both parties to each contribute ten yuan for travel expenses. Zhou made a written agreement to find Xizi within six months, after which the matter would be turned over to the authorities. This matter was discovered by the police officers of the third public security precinct, who, recognizing that this concerned a suspected homicide, took Zhou into custody. On the afternoon of the 22nd, someone reported that an old woman near Huayange in Cangqi Tu had heard three cries for help on the night of the 13th, which was likely related to the case. The police officer immediately dispatched police to investigate. Near an ice factory behind Huayange, they found a dog sniffing the ground, clawing at the dirt, and barking wildly. Sensing something amiss, they used tools to dig down about a foot and discovered a body buried in the ground. The head was smashed and the body was somewhat decomposed. The police retrieved the body and handed it over to the town police for safekeeping. Meanwhile, they ordered Liu Hengtai and his wife to identify it. They confirmed that it was the body of their son, Liu Xizi, and that a tattoo on his hand matched. At 8:00 PM that evening, Director He of the Public Security Bureau personally went to the Third Precinct to interrogate Zhou Wentang. Zhou Wentang confessed without hesitation and implicated several accomplices. The adulterous woman, Zhang, admitted to having had an affair with Liu Xizi for half a year. Zong Zaihua claimed that he was only friends with her and had no physical relationship. He also stated that Zong had fled to a certain place in Shanghai. On the 23rd, the court dispatched Prosecutor Lu to conduct an autopsy. The autopsy revealed that the face and head of the body had been cleaved open, and that he had been hacked to death before his death. A coroner's report was completed. Zhou Guangqi, Zhou Baozhi, Xue Baochang, and Liu Cairu were apprehended. Zong Zaihua was captured in Shanghai, as were the murder weapon, a shovel, and other items. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, they were transferred to the prosecutor's office for investigation and legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>Taicang: Automobile Accident Injures Pedestrians on Shanghai-Nanjing Highway</h3>
<p>In Wuliangdian, Xinfeng Town, First District of the county, villagers had been staging opera performances for days to fulfill vows. The 22nd was the third day. Statues of deities from nearby temples were carried to watch the performances, causing the Shanghai-Nanjing Highway to be crowded with villagers. Automobiles passing by did not know to give way. Around noon, at approximately 12:00 PM, the 54th Shanghai-Nanjing bus was traveling along the road, about two kilometers from the Xinfeng Station, when a naughty child suddenly darted across the road. An old woman saw this and pulled the child back. The driver, Tian Zhiwan, swerved too sharply, and the front wheel went into a field. A number of onlookers were injured. Among them was an elderly woman named Zhang, 75 years old, who died from her injuries before she could receive treatment. Two other children, a boy and a girl, were seriously injured and were taken to Shanghai for medical treatment. Fortunately, the passengers were unharmed.</p>
<h3>Armed Robbery</h3>
<p>More than ten bandits, each wielding guns and other weapons, broke into the home of Sun Shunqing, a resident of Taiping Alley outside the Little North Gate of the city on the night of the 22nd. They confined the family to one room, threatened them into silence, and ransacked the house for about an hour. They made off with clothing and ornaments worth approximately two hundred yuan before fleeing. The victim has reported the crime to the county for investigation and apprehension of the perpetrators.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Deadline to Recover Embezzled Funds from Former Education Bureau Chief</h3>
<p>The former Education Bureau Chief of this county, Lu Jingmo, who is now the Director of Academic Affairs at a middle school in Anhui, was found to have embezzled a large sum of money, amounting to several thousand yuan, when he left his position as Bureau Chief. His accountant was placed under surveillance, and he was only allowed to leave Changshu after returning a portion of the money. Now, after further review of his accounts by the education and finance departments, a shortfall of 912 yuan, 6 jiao, and 1 fen remains. The education department has issued an order to the county, instructing them to recover the embezzled funds from Lu within half a month, so that the remaining education funds can be deposited in the treasury.</p>
<h3>New Isolation Ward for Sick Inmates at the Prison</h3>
<p>The number of inmates in the county prison and detention center has recently become very large. Due to the large number of inmates, sanitation has inevitably been insufficient. Since the 20th of last month, nearly fifty inmates have died of illness, most commonly from opium addiction and dysentery, with an average of two deaths per day. Because the prison is experiencing financial difficulties, there is no resident doctor. Doctors from the county hospital only visit once a day for diagnosis. The number of sick inmates continues to increase, and it has been impossible to isolate them. Therefore, the county government has surveyed the housing at the Caishen Temple of the New City God Temple for use as an isolation ward for sick inmates, in order to prevent the spread of infection. More than thirty sick inmates were moved there on the 22nd. Regarding medical treatment, the county government has consulted with private hospitals to seek their assistance, but there is no solution for the cost of medication.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Escaped Prisoner Surrenders to Authorities</h3>
<p>Shi Cansheng, a prisoner detained at the Wuyi County Prison and Detention Center for rape and arson, managed to escape over the wall on the afternoon of the 18th of this month. The local court was investigating and pursuing him. However, after escaping, the prisoner had no money. He hid in the fields and, upon hearing that his father had also been implicated and imprisoned, began to weep in despair. He even considered suicide. He then begged the Baojia chief to accompany him to the city. On the 22nd, he surrendered himself to the prosecutor's office of the local court. After interrogation, he was ordered to be transferred to the First Detention Center for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: 1936 Provincial Budget Estimate</h3>
<p>The provincial budget estimate for 1936, previously approved by the provincial government, totals 17.01 million yuan. The budget has been reissued to the Department of Finance for detailed compilation. It is now known that detailed figures for various items such as civil administration, education, construction, and finance have been compiled. After strict reduction, the revenue and expenditure are largely balanced. The budget has now been submitted to the provincial government for review. The local budgets of the counties for 1936 have mostly been examined, with only a few counties, such as Ganyu and Guanyun, yet to be reviewed. This process is expected to be completed within the week.</p>
<h3>Establishment of Land Tax Consolidation Commissioners in Various Counties</h3>
<p>In order to consolidate the finances of various counties, the Department of Finance convened the chiefs of the First Section and accounting directors of each county to the province for training. The Department of Finance also mandated the establishment of Land Tax Consolidation Commissioners in each county in 1936, assigned to work in the Second Section. Their salaries will be equivalent to a First Class Section Member. As this year is coming to an end, the Department of Finance has issued a special order to each county to quickly select individuals with rich experience and knowledge in land tax for submission to the Department for review and appointment.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Department Order for Free Tax Supplementation and Land Registration</h3>
<p>Ma Chang, the county chief of Jiangdu, reported that there were still many land purchase contracts in his county that had not been registered. He specifically requested instructions from the Department of Finance. The department has now issued an order to waive the reporting fees and uniformly allow tax supplementation and land registration. On the 21st, a special order was issued to the Tax Deed Office to comply.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Confiscation of Illicit Opium in Xiasha Eryao Town</h3>
<p>The Nantong Narcotics Investigation Department recently received a tip that Huang Zhaowen, the owner of the Huang Tongxing Trading Company in Xiasha Eryao Town of this county, was secretly selling illicit opium, and requested an investigation. After receiving the information, the investigation department telegraphed Wang Jianlu, the director of the county investigation sub-office, to conduct a search. Yesterday (the 20th) afternoon, Director Wang took investigators by special car, accompanied by multiple security team members stationed in the town, and searched the shop. As a result, several bags of illicit opium were seized. Huang Zhaowen escaped and has not been apprehended. His father was taken to the county along with the illicit opium. Today (the 21st), they were escorted to the Nantong Narcotics Investigation Department for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Daytime Robbery in the City</h3>
<p>At around 11:00 AM on the 22nd, bandits suddenly broke into the home of Zhou Zhan, located at No. 16, Fugui Alley in the city, and ransacked the house for about ten minutes before fleeing with their loot. Police officers pursued them, but were unable to apprehend them. In recent days, bandit activity in the four surrounding townships has intensified. Arson and large-scale robberies have occurred repeatedly. A woman named Ji Shi, over sixty years old, from Huai Dong Township, was also killed by bandits.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Young Woman Commits Suicide Due to Quarrel</h3>
<p>Ms. Wu, the wife of Qian Dekang, a resident of Yu Matou outside the North Gate of this city, was about thirty years old. Her relationship with her husband had been strained and they often argued. On the morning of the 20th, they quarreled again over a trivial matter. Ms. Wu, overcome by despair, went to a nearby opium den in the afternoon, bought ten pieces of opium, and swallowed them in an act of suicide. Upon returning home, her family noticed a sudden change in her complexion and realized that she had taken poison. They desperately tried to save her, but it was too late. She died at around 6:00 PM, a tragic end indeed.</p>

Recently, financial customs enforcement inspectors discovered that the transporter was suspected of selling salt in high-tax areas. Evidence was collected and reported to the Shanghai General Office. It is now known that the Yuyao Public Office has received an order from the General Office to dispatch personnel to seal the two salt depots of the transporter yesterday.</p>

<h3>Sun Tonggang Returned to Shanghai Yesterday; Aviation Associations and Others Sent Representatives to Welcome Him; Expressed Great Admiration for President Chiang</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the young aviator Sun Tonggang went to Italy last year to further his studies in aviation. He returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM aboard the Italian liner Victoria. The China Aviation Association and the Shanghai Local Association, led by Du Yuesheng, sent representatives to welcome him. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency interviewed him aboard the ship. The following is a record of his discussions on his study experience and the aviation situation in Italy:</p>
<p>Delayed Arrival Due to Fog</p>
<p>The Victoria, on which Mr. Sun was travelling, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 6:00 AM yesterday morning. However, due to heavy fog encountered the previous evening near Daji Mountain, visibility was so poor that it was difficult to discern direction within a meter. The ship was in danger of running aground, so it anchored and waited until the next morning (yesterday morning) to sail to Shanghai. Consequently, it did not arrive until 2:00 PM, eight hours behind schedule, and docked at the China Merchants North Wharf.</p>
<p>Sun Talks About His Experiences in Italy</p>
<p>According to Mr. Sun, he went abroad in mid-April last year. His intended duration of stay was a year and two months, but he returned earlier due to domestic affairs, shortening his study by two months. This did not affect his coursework. During his year in Italy, he not only studied bombing, reconnaissance, high-speed and other aviation subjects at the Atlantic Aviation Team, but also visited various aviation schools and aircraft manufacturing plants. Therefore, from the time he arrived in Italy until he returned home on April 26th, he did not leave the country even once.</p>
<p>[Photo of Sun Tonggang's Return (International News Agency)]</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Italy's Aviation Strength</p>
<p>Italy's aviation strength, when I first arrived last year, I felt it was simply stronger than our country's aviation. It was not until the outbreak of the East African War that its full strength was revealed. During the six months before and after the outbreak of the war, to say nothing of other aviation preparations, the number of huge bombers capable of carrying 4,000 pounds of bombs, propelled by three engines, reached 700. Therefore, its comprehensive and substantial aviation organization, including materials, engineering, driving talent, wireless operators, and various indirect and direct aviation elements, is impressive.</p>
<p>The Current State of Sino-Italian Relations</p>
<p>The relationship between China and Italy has always been extremely cordial. However, due to the economic sanctions, the relationship seems weaker on the surface. But although Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has never met our President Chiang, their spiritual connection is very harmonious because Mussolini has always admired President Chiang, and President Chiang also appreciates Mussolini's determination and ideology. Mr. Sun plans to go to Nanjing today to report to President Chiang.</p>
<h3>The Minyuan Ship Launched Yesterday</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate the transportation of construction materials for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the Minsheng Company commissioned the Jiangnan Shipyard to build the Minyuan and Minben vessels in February of this year. The Minben vessel was launched on the 19th of this month, and the Minyuan vessel was also launched on the 23rd. The two vessels are identical in size, design, and equipment, making them the largest ships operating on the Sichuan River. The hull is 230 feet long, 36 feet wide, 12 feet 6 inches deep, with a draft of 9 and a half feet, and a deadweight of 600 tons. The speed is 14 and a half miles per hour. All machinery and equipment are newly manufactured. The hull is constructed entirely of double-layered steel plates, making it exceptionally strong. The construction took more than four months. After the internal renovation and arrangement are completed, it will be ready for sailing in early August. The construction cost is estimated to be more than 800,000 yuan. The ship has five first-class cabins, fifteen official cabins, and ten regular cabins, each accommodating fifteen passengers. The cargo hold is even larger, with ample capacity, making it ideal for transporting heavy goods and large quantities of materials. The two vessels will join the direct Shanghai-Chongqing route, specializing in the transportation of construction materials for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. With these two vessels operating on the Sichuan River, not only will the material transportation problem for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway be solved, but Sichuan Province will also be able to handle other railway construction projects in the future. Those attending the ceremony yesterday included Du Yuesheng, Hu Yunjun, Huang Renzhi, and other guests from all walks of life, totaling more than one hundred people. Ms. Hu Qiying, the daughter of Hu Yunjun, performed the launching ceremony. The shipyard director Ma delivered a speech on the shipbuilding process. Then, Huang Renzhi and Du Yuesheng gave speeches. Finally, the company manager Zhang Shulin reported on the purpose of building the ship. The ceremony concluded at 3:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Secures Loan for Remaining Cocoons; Contract Signed in Hangzhou; China and Bank of Communications to Provide a Five Million Yuan Loan</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Zhejiang Silk Control Committee, using 3 million yuan in Zhejiang Consolidation Bonds and all the revenue from its cocoons as collateral, borrowed 5 million yuan from the China and Bank of Communications. The China Bank provided 3 million yuan, and the Bank of Communications provided 2 million yuan. After discussions between Wu Shenbo, the standing member of the committee, and the two banks, the contract was signed in Hangzhou. The interest rate is set at 9%, and the term is eight months. The committee will draw funds from the Hangzhou branches of the China and Bank of Communications as needed, depending on its cocoon purchase needs. After the contract was signed, the Hangzhou branches of the China and Bank of Communications reported this to their Shanghai head offices. At the same time, the secretary of the Silk Control Committee also telegraphed Wu Shenbo in Shanghai to report.</p>
<p>Committee Formed:</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency interviewed Mr. Wu Shenbo, a standing member of the Zhejiang Provincial Silk Control Committee, yesterday morning. According to him, after successfully securing a 5 million yuan loan for cocoon purchases, the Silk Control Committee has formed a 1936 Spring Cocoon Purchasing Committee to manage the purchase of the remaining cocoons. Although the registration of Zhejiang silk factories and cocoon merchants for the purchase of remaining cocoons has been enthusiastic, there are still about 100 cocoon houses in the province that no one has leased. At the same time, there are about 35,000 piculs of dry cocoons remaining. The Silk Control Committee aims to benefit farmers by opening the unleased cocoon houses to purchase cocoons.</p>
<p>Standardized Cocoon Prices:</p>
<p>The Zhejiang spring cocoons were initially affected by the cold weather. Due to the recent favorable weather, the spring cocoons have been bountiful. It is estimated that the total yield of improved silkworm cocoons in the province will be approximately 320,000 piculs, and the total yield of native silkworm cocoons will be approximately 180,000 piculs. The Silk Control Committee has set the standard price for Zhejiang spring cocoons: 30 yuan (national currency) per picul for improved varieties, and 21 yuan (national currency) per picul for native varieties. Silk factories, cocoon merchants, and the Silk Control Committee throughout Zhejiang will purchase cocoons according to the above standards.</p>
<h3>Strict Prohibition of Commercial Vessels Anchoring Near the Longhua Airport Seaplane Landing Area; Ministry of Communications Orders Shanghai Navigation Bureau Yesterday; Due to Danger of Obstructing Aircraft Takeoff and Landing</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Navigation Bureau received Instruction No. 1843 from the Ministry of Communications yesterday, stating: For compliance, the Euro-Asia Airlines Company has reported: The eastern boundary of the Longhua Airport is close to the Huangpu River. Vessels often anchor there at will, which obstructs aircraft takeoff and landing and creates danger. Years ago, the airport caused an accident due to ships anchoring along the river. This is a lesson from the past. If strict measures are not taken, it will not be safe. Although the Shanghai Municipal Government has repeatedly approved orders to the Public Works Bureau and the Longhua Airport Management Office to jointly prohibit anchoring, the effect is minimal. This is possibly because the jurisdiction only extends to ordinary passenger ships and sampans, and there may be no way to stop larger commercial vessels. However, the masts and funnels of these commercial vessels are particularly high, and anchoring near the airport poses a greater danger and ultimately obstructs flights. It is proposed that the Ministry instruct the Shanghai Navigation Bureau to order all shipping companies to designate the section of the Huangpu River from the southern end of the company's new shed factory to the northern end of the Shanghai Cement Factory as a restricted area where commercial vessels are strictly prohibited from anchoring or lingering, in order to ensure safety. Whether this is feasible or not is submitted for review. In this regard, it is certain that the proximity of commercial vessels to the airport is quite dangerous. Therefore, all shipping companies must be ordered to ensure that all commercial vessels do not anchor or linger in the Huangpu River area from the southern end of the Euro-Asia Company's new shed factory to the northern end of the Shanghai Cement Factory in order to ensure safety. In addition to the instructions, this order is hereby issued for compliance and strict enforcement. This order.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Industry Replies to the Chamber of Commerce, etc.; The Government is Closely Monitoring Smuggling; Railways and Ships are Strictly Seizing Smuggled Goods; Various Industries Propose Anti-Smuggling Opinions</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, the Bankers' Association, and the Money Dealers' Association, among other four groups, telegraphed the government requesting strict anti-smuggling measures, a telegram reply was received yesterday from the Ministry of Industry. All industries and railways and ships in Shanghai have been strictly preventing smuggling. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram Reply from the Ministry</p>
<p>In order to strictly combat smuggling, in addition to the Executive Yuan promulgating the "Regulations on Punishing Tax Evasion," the Ministry of Finance has also formulated "Provisional Regulations on Investigating the Transportation and Sales of Imported Goods" to strictly prevent smuggling. Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and others received a reply telegram from the Ministry of Industry: "To the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, the Bankers' Association, and the Money Dealers' Association: Regarding the matter of smuggling, the government has long been closely monitoring it. In addition to promulgating the 'Regulations on Punishing Tax Evasion,' the Ministry of Finance has also separately formulated strict regulations for suppression. Reply specially, Ministry of Industry."</p>
<p>Ships and Railways</p>
<p>After the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration received the order from the Ministry of Railways to promulgate the "Regulations on Punishing Tax Evasion," it immediately instructed all stations along the line and all offices to strictly suppress smuggling, and also sent a letter to the customs office to dispatch customs officers to key stations to inspect smuggled goods. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Shanghai Shipping Trade Association have both received telegrams from the Ministry of Transportation, instructing their affiliates and all shipping companies to strictly investigate and prevent smuggling.</p>
<p>Prevention by Various Industries</p>

For example, the Cotton Cloth Trade Association has already submitted its opinions.</p>

<h3>The Red Pill Framing Case is Swiftly Solved; Plotting for Half a Year...Harboring Grievances...Framing and Accusation; Solved in Three Hours...The Whole Case...Comes to Light</h3>
<p>The Investigation Team of the Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>Ye Fushi, a resident of No. 108 Shangwen Road, Xiaoximen, this port (also known as Hu Xiaozhou, raised by the Ye family since childhood, hence the name Ye Fubao), is in his sixties and comes from Baoshan County. His family is wealthy and he has three sons. Hu has been running a northern goods and fish business for decades, opening three shops in this port: Tongyu, Maoxing, and Qianji, which are doing fairly well. This year, Wang Zhongyin, a fellow villager with the courtesy name Qiyuan, 24 years old, and Wang's father, Tao Sun, 50 years old, worked as accountants in the northern goods shop opened by Ye Fubao, embezzling over ten thousand yuan, which Ye paid off. Later, they continued to embezzle funds, and Ye was forced to dismiss them, still owing more than two thousand yuan. Last year, both Wang and his son lost their jobs and harbored deep resentment towards Ye Fubao. In the first month of this year, Wang Zhongyin went to the Changjiang Hotel in Zhengjia Muqiao and met Zhang Hanchen (nicknamed A'hu, working as a room service attendant in Yuebao Changjiang each inn), a fellow villager from Baoshan. Talking about dealing with Hu Xiaozhou (i.e., Ye Fubao), A'hu suggested buying pills to frame the Ye family, and colluded with Yang Wenbing and Chen Bin to carry out the plan. Wang Zhongyin paid fifty-six yuan to A'hu, who bought eight packets of red pills from Yang Dakuaitou and sent them to Yang Wenbing in Jiangwan to find a way to smuggle them into Ye Fubao's home in Baoshan (i.e., Hu Xiaozhou). On one hand, Wang Zhongyin invited Yang Wenbing to the Changjiang Hotel to report to Chen Guangyan of the Public Security Bureau, but because Yang Wenbing had no way to smuggle the red pills into Ye's home in Baoshan, he had to cancel the previous guarantee to the Public Security Bureau, and the matter was dropped. Later, Zhang A'hu still refused to give up and continued to find ways to proceed, consulting with his friend Zhu Faxiang, who currently lives in Nanyang Bridge and works in a certain minister's residence. Song immediately accepted, saying he had a sure way, and asked Yang Wenbing to come to Song's house to sign a guarantee and report the matter, and secretly transport the red pills to Baoshan. On one hand, Song Faxiang signed a guarantee and secretly reported to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, claiming that there was a huge red pill trafficking organization in Baoshan, which trafficked in quantities of two or three hundred thousand each time. This was the secret report that the Garrison Headquarters received from Song Faxiang on the first of this month. Commander Yang immediately approved the document and instructed the investigation team to handle it carefully. After receiving the order, the investigation team sent officers to contact Song Faxiang to carry out the investigation. After several discussions, they did not get to the point. Because Yang Wenbing could not smuggle the red pills into Ye's home in Baoshan, he kept perfunctorily delaying. The investigation team, believing that the secret report was a major case, strictly questioned the original reporter Song Faxiang and the informants Chen Bin and Yang Wenbing one after another, and sent officers to Baoshan for strict investigation. The results obtained were inconsistent with the original report, so they were not processed. At that time, Song Faxiang and Chen Bin threatened Wang Zhongyin to compensate them for the loss of five hundred yuan because the case could not be established. Wang Shenyin was disheartened by this, and there was no huge amount of reward. Zhang A'hu and Yang Wenbing, who had initially suggested and been responsible for handling the matter to Wang Zhongyin, had no choice but to try again. Wang Zhongyin decided to pay two yuan and two cents to A'hu and Yang Wenbing to go to No. 108 Shangwen Road, Xiaoxitou, for medical treatment. It turned out that Ye's residence at No. 108 also had a downstairs wing room rented to a Wang surname doctor, who shared an entrance and exit and connected to the inner hall of Hu's residence. A'hu and Yang Wenbing went to Hu's residence for medical treatment for the first time and did not have the opportunity, so they did not smuggle the pills in. On the morning of the 20th of this month, Yang Wenbing accompanied A'hu to see a doctor again. Yang Wenbing saw that there was no one and took the opportunity to throw three packets of red pills he had brought into the plaque in Hu's living room. Then he consulted with Song Faxiang, Chen Bin, Wang Zhongyin, and others, and agreed on a time to search. At twelve o'clock in the morning on the 21st of this month, the investigation team received a phone call from Song Faxiang, saying that the goods had been transported in and requesting them to send officers quickly. Captain Wang immediately selected several officers and went to Nanyang Bridge first. The original reporter Song Faxiang and informants Chen Bin and Yang Wenbing led them to Ye Fubao's residence at No. 108 Shangwen Road, Xiaoximen. The team members, seeing that the location was inconsistent with the original report from the previous day, found it difficult to search. The original reporter explained that it was indeed from Baoshan. The team members then notified the local patrol police to lead them into Ye's residence to search. Initially, the person in charge of the case, after a thorough investigation of the situation in the residence, said that the red pill trafficking organization was hard to believe. They searched all suspicious locations and found nothing. Then they found that on the wall of the hall, there were new handprints made within the past two days. Looking up, there was a plaque, and they suspected that there must be something hidden there. Yang Wenbing also pointed out that there was something on the plaque. Chen Bin climbed up and indeed found three packets of red pills. They immediately took the homeowner Ye Fubao, Ye's daughter-in-law Ye Bao Shi, Ye's maid Zhuang Huibao, Wang A'san, and the original reporter Song Faxiang, informants Yang Wenbing and Chen Bin to the team headquarters. After individual interrogations, Ye Fubao was indeed an honest businessman and was already sixty-four years old, and was guaranteed by Tongyu, MaoYu, and Qianji, three northern goods shops, that he would never risk sacrificing himself to traffic in drugs. When questioned about the original reporter Song Faxiang, he pushed everything to the informants Yang Wenbing and Chen Bin, who were responsible for the report. Yang Wenbing and Chen Bin were immediately interrogated strictly. Initially, their words were hesitant, but eventually, they confessed the truth about the framing. The team immediately arrested the masterminds Wang Zhongyin and Zhang Hanchen (A'hu). One by one, they were interrogated separately, and they confessed to the truth of the matter of harboring grievances against Ye Fubao, designing to frame him, and harming him. Ye Fubao, Ye Bao Shi, etc., were released after signing a guarantee. All the suspects Wang Zhongyin, Zhang Hanchen, Song Faxiang, Yang Wenbing, and Chen Bin were handed over to the headquarters for trial. It took only three hours from the seizure of the stolen goods to the full disclosure of the case. It is said that Ye Fubao suddenly suffered an unexpected disaster and an unwarranted calamity. Fortunately, the investigation team had discerning eyes and extraordinary speed, and brought the whole case to light in three hours, eliminating the villains and protecting the good, which is truly a blessing for the community. They will present a plaque to praise their merits, etc.</p>

<h3>Yu Qiaqing Sends a Letter; Fish Shops Should Resume Business First; Persuading for a Solution, Continuing the Shutdown Causes More Losses</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association is mediating the dispute between the fish market and the thirteen fish shops that have not joined the fish market. After convening an emergency executive supervisory committee to discuss the matter, it is now persuading both parties and there should be a reasonable solution.

<h3>Lawyers May Not Practice in County Governments That Also Handle Judicial Matters; Jiangsu High Court Orders Local Bar Associations</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu High Court recently issued Instruction No. 9987 to local bar associations: "The practice of law by lawyers should be done in ordinary courts; this is stipulated in Article 1 of the Lawyers' Regulations. They may not practice in county governments that also handle judicial matters. This has also been interpreted and filed by the Supreme Court in Interpretation No. 123 of the seventeenth year. However, it has recently been discovered that some lawyers have established offices or branch offices in county government areas that also handle judicial matters, employing clerks to solicit lawsuits, or even serving as legal advisors to local merchants and residents, advertising widely and engaging in publicity. This behavior is in conflict with the aforementioned regulations and is highly inappropriate. In addition to separately ordering the counties that also handle judicial matters to investigate and prohibit this, we hereby order your association to be notified and to forward this to all members for compliance and strict attention."</p>

<h3>Maritime Organizations Strive for the Right to Elect National Representatives</h3>
<p>The Chinese Seamen's Union, the Seamen's Special Party Branch, the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Unions, and the Special Party Branches of the two railways, held the first joint meeting at the Seamen's Union the other day at the request of representatives from various affiliated trade union organizations. Several important cases were discussed and resolved, as reported in various newspapers. It is now known that the Chinese Seamen's Union received a telegram from its Zhenjiang branch yesterday, stating: "Yang Goujian, Special Commissioner of the Chinese Seamen's Union, has examined the election law for the National Assembly and found that there are no clear provisions for the election of representatives from special trade unions. Does this mean that our Seamen's Union has no right to elect representatives? However, the Seamen's Union is a formal organization directly under the central government with central approval for its establishment, so there should be no reason to deprive it of the right to vote. If it is argued that seamen are affiliated with various provinces, there are various practical impossibilities. It is thought that the three major special trade unions of seamen, railways, and post and telecommunications were omitted. We request that you telegraph the central government and request amendments, so that all members of our seamen's union are not deprived of their civil rights. The Preparatory Committee of the Zhenjiang Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Union." In addition, the Jiujiang branch sent a telegram with the same meaning. In addition, representatives from more than 20 organizations, including the Jianghai Steamboat Middle Cabin Office Seamen, the Qiahe Jianghai Stevedoring Club, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Stevedoring Office, the New Taikoo Jianghai Stevedore Club, the Yan Ying General Office, the Yihe Rear Cabin Employees Tongyi Society, and the Shanglun Lianyi Association in this city, brought joint petitions from their respective organizations to the office of the Special Commissioner of the Chinese Seamen's Union yesterday, requesting a circular telegram to all parties to strive for the right to elect national representatives for special trade unions, and requesting another telegram to the central government to amend the election law for national representatives and to give preferential additions to the number of national representatives for various special trade unions, stating that our seamen workers have a glorious history in the Party and the country, and our Seamen's Union is a central and direct entire organization. Whether in terms of the number of people and scope of business, or its special nature, according to the principles of the National Assembly Election Law previously set by the central government, and the proportional distribution with other trade unions, at least more than ten national representatives should be prescribed for seamen. The Legislative Yuan is now drafting this election law, but it does not follow the central principles, and the trade union is divided into provincial and municipal regions, so that our seamen and special trade unions do not know how to participate in the election, and there is no stipulation of even one word for our seamen railway and post and telecommunications. This matter is related to the major national legislative plan and the political power of workers. If it is not intentional deprivation, it is negligent omission. Our millions of transportation workers will not give way and will not be willing to give up participating in the political power of the National Assembly representatives. Please send personnel to lead the representatives to the capital to petition and vow to fight to the death, etc. Wang Jiyi, the secretary of the association, met with them and told them that he was currently complying with the requests of the seamen workers and planned to unite the Seamen's Party Branch, the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Party Branches, and the unions of the two railways and other institutions, to convene representatives from the seamen's branches and railway party branches and unions in various places, and to gather in the capital on a scheduled date to make large-scale petitions, which would hopefully achieve considerable results. The seamen representatives then left one after another.</p>
<h3>Maritime Community Strives for Piloting Rights</h3>
<p>The Kuaiyou Telegram from the Shanghai District Party Branch of the Seamen's Special Party Branch stated: To all Seamen's District Party Branches, Seamen's Branches, Seamen's Organizations, and Newspaper Offices: It has recently been approved by the China Yangtze River Leading Navigation General Association's telegram, requesting assistance from all sectors of the country due to the Shanghai Pilotage Management Committee's poor management, and requesting that it be transferred to the Ministry of Communications for separate management to prevent foreign personnel from manipulating the customs. At the same time, it stipulates that those who have passed the training at the Naval Pilotage Training Institute and obtained certificates, and who have served for more than five years without any mistakes and have proof, shall be allowed to practice without examination, in order to protect legally acquired qualifications, etc. It is found that the pilotage business is related to national defense and transportation, and all countries in the world control it themselves. Not only the management affairs, but foreigners have no way to get involved, and the pilotage positions are strictly prohibited from foreigners. The various sections of the General Association's appeal are enough to be thought-provoking. As for the transfer to the Ministry of Communications for management, it is especially pertinent and important. In addition to telegraphing the Chinese Seamen's Special Party Branch and forwarding it to the Central People's Training Department, and consulting and forwarding it to the competent departments, we hereby send this special telegram, hoping for unanimous support, so as to achieve the goal and consolidate our country's pilotage barrier. The Chinese Kuomintang Chinese Seamen's Special Party Branch, Shanghai District Party Branch.</p>

<h3>The Reason Why a Young Girl Took Poison: She Accused Zhang Ding’an of Abandoning Her</h3>
<p>At around 3:00 PM the other day, someone sent a young girl who had taken poison to the Pushen Hospital on Xinmin Road, Zhabei, for examination. Doctor Zhou Hongzhang examined her and found that the girl had taken raw opium. He immediately performed surgery and used vomiting methods to expel the opium she had swallowed. After she regained consciousness, she was asked and said that her name was Gu Xiulin, she was 18 years old, and she was from Bin Ying. She lived with her uncle at 26 Debaoli, Jinling Road. Her uncle's name was Yuan Xianglin. The reason for the poisoning was that in the spring of last year, she went to Dr. Zhang Ding'an's clinic at 271 Meiyuan Road, Gonghe Road, to treat her menstrual problems. Zhang seduced her, and they often went back and forth. Later, he didn't want me anymore. I have no face to see anyone and can't go back to my hometown. So I stole my uncle's cigarette photo, bought half a yuan of raw opium, and swallowed it. I swallowed it at around 11:00 AM today (that is, yesterday), and so on. Later, someone reported it to the Xinzha Sub-bureau. Director Liao sent police to summon Zhang Ding'an for questioning. After Commissioner Huang found out the details, he ordered Gu Xiulin, her uncle Gu Xianglin, and Doctor Zhang Ding'an, along with an empty box of Yiwanyi company's opium paste, to be sent to the Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3>An Apprentice Died After Being Crushed by an Iron Box at the Guangyi Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Nanshi</h3>
<p>The Guangyi Dyeing and Weaving Factory at 1 Huining Road, Jin'anfang, Nanshi, was opened by shareholders Wu Youfa and Shaoxing. The accountant was Yu Jinlin. The factory had not yet started work. An apprentice at the factory, Wu Youquan, 18 years old (Wu Youfa's younger brother), was helping to move the machinery at around 7:00 PM the night before when an iron box suddenly fell and crushed his chest, causing serious injuries. He was sent to Shanghai Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective. He died at 9:00 PM. After reporting the incident to the bureau, it ordered the local bailiff to arrive for inspection at 11:00 AM yesterday. Wu's mother, Feng, and Youfa then sent the body to the Shaoxing Guild Hall for burial.</p>
<h3>Two Apprentices Run Away from Abuse, Zhang Guochao Dies from Poisoning, Zhu Zude Stays at the Bureau Awaiting Collection</h3>
<p>At around 5:00 PM the other day, a boy, wearing a gray short jacket, white cloth pants, and sneakers, about ten years old, went to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Station in Meilongzhen, West Shanghai, to buy a ticket to Hangzhou. The stationmaster, Bo Tai'an, saw that his appearance was suspicious and asked his name. He claimed to be Zhang Guochao, 15 years old, from Ningbo. He was apprenticed to Zhang Huasheng Clothing Shop at 614 Gonghexin Road, Zhabei. Because he was abused by the plaintiff, Zhang Kunlin, he received 12.7 yuan of account money and went to find another life. The stationmaster saw that he was young and ignorant and feared that he would be seduced by bad people, so he ordered the railway police to detain him and planned to send him to the Nanzhan Police Station for relief the next day. Unexpectedly, at around 7:00 AM yesterday, the child's face was pale and unconscious. He knew that he had taken poison. He immediately reported it to the police station in the town and sent the child to the Shangzhong Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Middle School for treatment. Because he had taken too much poison, he died before reaching the hospital. Afterwards, 10 yuan in legal tender, a bill for making clothes, and half a small bottle of anti-medicine were found on his body. He immediately sent someone to investigate at Gonghexin Road, Zhabei, but there was no Zhang Huasheng shop number. Yesterday morning, Li Fen, a prosecutor appointed by the local court, arrived at the scene with an inspector to examine the body. The examination found that the boy, Zhang Guochao, had indeed died from taking poison during his lifetime. He ordered photos to be taken and the body was handed over to the local bailiff to prepare a coffin for burial, waiting for relatives to claim it. Also, Zhu Zude, a 15-year-old man from Changzhou, was an apprentice at the Da Zhonghua Printing Company on Kaifeng Road, Zhabei. Because he could not stand the abuse of his master, he escaped alone the other day and planned to return to his home in Changzhou. Because he did not know the way and had no travel expenses, he was crying at the Xinzhuang Railway Station in West Shanghai. Later, the police on duty arrived and took him back to the station. After questioning by the patrol officer, the company was notified yesterday to collect him to avoid wandering.</p>
<h3>Chen Yuqing Died in the Flower of Her Youth After Taking Poison Because She Was Reproached for Being in Love</h3>
<p>Chen Yuqing, the 17-year-old daughter of Chen Hu, the owner of the Chen Shanji Laundry Shop (33 years old, husband deceased) at 67 Qianjiatang Lane, behind the Weida Hotel on Yaerpe Road, Xiafei Road, French Concession, suddenly fell in love with Ni Aquan (24 years old), a pants ironer from Ningbo in the shop, this year. Recently, a neighbor living with them informed her mother. At 1:00 PM on the 22nd, Chen Hu scolded her daughter Yuqing, and a quarrel broke out. Afterwards, the daughter had the idea of ​​being tired of the world. So when she went to bed at night, she secretly swallowed poison and committed suicide. She groaned when the poison took effect that night. The girl's mother was shocked when she heard it and went into her daughter's room to check. Yuqing's face was pale, and she couldn't open her mouth to speak. She then reported it to the French Concession Patrol Room and sent Yuche to Guangci Hospital. Because she had been poisoned too deeply, the treatment was ineffective, and she died at 7:00 AM yesterday. The hospital notified the Patrol Room and sent detectives to send the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for autopsy. At noon that day, the Second Special Court was requested to send Prosecutor Wang Ren and a forensic secretary to the office to examine the body. It was found that the deceased had indeed died from taking poison. The official questioned the corpse, Chen Hu, and ordered the corpse's mother to collect the coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Boatman Liu Zhengheng Arrested for Adultery and Abduction of Zhang Jiufen</h3>
<p>Zhang Wenlong, a 37-year-old man from Gaoyou, works as a porter at the Xinchangtai riverside in Nanshi. His daughter, Jiufen, is currently 20 years old. She was promised to marry a Xu family from the same township since she was a child, but she has not yet passed through the door. She is somewhat attractive and good at dressing up, which is why Liu Zhengheng (34 years old), a boatman from Taizhou on the Yangjiadu oil boat, coveted her. He went to her place from time to time, pretending to be courteous, and was seduced into adultery. Then, on the afternoon of the 16th of this month, he took advantage of his father's unpreparedness and abducted her and hid her. Zhang immediately searched everywhere, but found nothing. Then, Zhang Zideng buckled and spotted Liu Zhengheng hiding among them on a cargo ship parked at the No. 9 Wharf in Nanmen at 7:00 AM yesterday, so he reported it to the police and took Liu to the Municipal Water Patrol Corps. After Director Wei found out the details, he sent it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning on the grounds that the case involved adultery and fraud.</p>

<h3>High Tide in Huangpu Yesterday Morning, Water Overflowed on Low-Lying Roads, Quantity Eleven Feet High and More, Believed to be Caused by the Rising Yangtze River</h3>
<p>At 1:55 AM yesterday morning, a sudden high tide occurred in the Huangpu River, with the water level reaching more than eleven feet high, exceeding the prediction of the Lupu General Administration. The reason was believed to be the rising Yangtze River. At that time, the tide was very rapid, with a speed of between 1.4 nautical miles per hour. The high tide began to recede at 4:40 AM yesterday morning and did not return to normal until after 9:00 AM. When the tide was full, water overflowed from the sewers on the side of Wing On Company on Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, as well as at the intersection of Gansu Road and Arabai Side Road, and in front of the China Business Company on Sichuan Road, because the terrain was particularly low. Water accumulated on both sides of the road.</p>
<h3>Quietness of Jing'an Temple Incense Pilgrimage is Over, Vendors Begin Setting Up Stalls, Stretching for Several Miles, Forming a Giant Market, Police Horse Patrols Deployed</h3>
<p>The annual incense pilgrimage to Jing'an Temple in this city began yesterday afternoon. Stalls lined the area around the temple for several miles, forming a giant market. Police horse patrols were also deployed, conducting armed patrols, creating a solemn atmosphere. Observations are described as follows:</p>
<p>Stalls Lined Up</p>
<p>The period during which vendors are allowed to set up stalls for this year's incense pilgrimage has been stipulated by the Public Works Department to be from 6:00 PM yesterday to 6:00 PM on the 29th. The location remains as determined last year, starting east from Jing'an Temple Road and Hart Road, and a portion of Hart Road, west from Yuyuan Road to Difeng Road, south from Haig Road and Jing'an Temple Road, and north to Jessfield Road and Edinburgh Road. Along both sides of the sidewalks in the above-mentioned area, various vendors had already set up stalls densely packed together before 3:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Exquisite Merchandise</p>
<p>Each stall occupies an area of approximately six English feet, covered with canvas awnings or bamboo fences to shield from wind and rain, and each equipped with an electric light. According to the temple's registration and fee collection records, there are a total of 1,500 vendors. The most common merchandise on display is handicrafts, especially bamboo ware, wooden ware, and rattan ware, which are exquisitely made and exceptionally durable and beautiful. Therefore, when the displays began yesterday afternoon, many foreigners were selecting and purchasing from stall to stall, and the number of domestic customers was even greater.</p>
<p>Horse Patrols</p>
<p>The Jing'an Temple Road Police Station, in order to maintain traffic, deployed several Indian police officers riding white horses for armed patrols from 2:00 PM yesterday, prohibiting loitering. The gate of Jing'an Temple has also been decorated with a cypress tree banner, adorned with four golden characters celebrating the Buddha's birthday. The main hall is even more brilliantly lit with candles, and filled with incense smoke. Furthermore, it is learned that the 28th of this month is the actual day of Buddha's birthday, when there will be an even greater abundance of elegant attire and hair ornaments, reaching its peak.</p>
<h3>Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Sales Meeting, Samples Displayed for Trading Yesterday, 11,500 Chests of Black Tea Shipped to Shanghai, Classified into 105 Types, Sent to Various Foreign Firms for Selection, Foreign Tea Firms' Meeting the Night Before Did Not Yield Results</h3>
<p>The Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea General Sales Office has received 11,500 chests of new tea produced in Qimen, Fuliang, Zhide, Ningzhou, and other places, which have been shipped to Shanghai and are stored in the warehouses of the Shanghai Bank. The association specially took out samples the day before yesterday, and the quality assessment committee conducted a detailed assessment of the grades of the goods, classifying them into 105 types. These samples were sent to various foreign firms in Shanghai engaged in black tea sales, such as Jardine Matheson, Gibb Livingston, and Paul Unna, as well as Chinese companies engaged in black tea exports, such as Huacha, Dingzhong, and Jianyuan, for trial viewing. Formal purchases will have to wait until next week, and prices will also be determined by the global supply and demand situation. It is reported that the production volume of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces this year is approximately 80,000 chests, which will continue to be shipped to Shanghai to facilitate sales. As for the quality assessment, it will be done quickly as soon as the goods arrive.</p>
<p>Changes in Sales Director</p>
<p>The association's sales director was originally appointed Zheng Jianyuan, manager of the Yuanfeng Tea House in this city. However, Zheng once requested to resign because the tea houses had a common decision and it was difficult to be unique. Now, the association has decided that the position of sales director will be concurrently held by General Manager Cheng Zhenji, and Zheng Jianyuan and Wang Yusan have been added as deputy directors, responsible for various sales matters such as product display and negotiation. According to General Manager Cheng Zhenji of the association, when speaking to a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency yesterday, the government's unified control and sales of black tea is actually to save the status of Chinese tea in the international market and to seek the recovery of the entire tea industry. Therefore, the association welcomes those with experience in the tea business to join and assist.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting of Tea Firms</p>
<p>The foreign tea firms' association, in order to cooperate effectively with the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Sales Office to facilitate sales since the first batch of new black tea goods has arrived in Shanghai, convened an emergency meeting at the association at 7:00 PM the night before to discuss cooperation and external measures. More than ten representatives from fourteen companies, including Zhongxinchang, Yuyuan, and Gongshengyong, such as Chen Yizhou and Hong Mengpan, attended. Chairman Hong Mengpan reported that the new Qimen black tea goods had arrived in Shanghai and would soon be displayed for sale, but there were many obstacles in the sales methods set by the sales office, which should be discussed together in order to achieve effective cooperation between the two parties, so that the promotion of domestic exports would not be affected in any way, and the sales office and the tea firms would also share the benefits. After the chairman's report, discussions began. The tea firm representatives unanimously believed that the sales methods set by the sales office were actually unable to cope with foreign affairs, which was deeply regrettable. Although the tea firms were willing to show sincerity and seek effective cooperation, they were afraid that it would still be difficult to achieve practical results if the sales office did not indicate that it would modify the sales methods. The meeting adjourned after 9:00 PM without reaching a conclusion, and it was decided to hold another meeting at a later date.</p>
<h3>Dispute in Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fishing Areas, Fishermen from Jinshan, Jiangsu Province, Block Fish Products Going to Zhejiang, Pinghu Fishery Association Sends Telegrams to Various Parties in Shanghai Appealing</h3>
<p>Residents of Baisha Bay in Pinghu, Zhejiang Province, rely on fishing for a living. The source of their fish products mostly comes from the upstream areas of the Tanxu Island and Yewangpan areas near Jinshanwei in Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province. Recently, fishermen from Jinshanwei have built bamboo windows and nets across the Yewangpan area, blocking the passage of fish. As a result, the fish were all caught by the Jiangsu people, and the Pinghu fishermen sighed in vain. Therefore, they specially telegraphed the Pinghu Association of Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai and various national bodies to appeal. The original telegram stated: "We, the residents of Baisha Bay in Pinghu, Zhejiang Province, have been fishing for generations. Jinshanwei in Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, is about several dozen miles away from our hometown. Fishermen from both places used to fish in the sea by boat, with the provincial boundary as the limit. Unexpectedly, in the spring of last year, fishermen from Jinshanwei built nets on Tanxu Island and Yewangpan in our province's territorial waters, and recently they have intensified their efforts, widening the area of the windows and nets they have built to more than 140 miles. After investigation, the Tanxu Island and Yewangpan area west of Baishan all belong to Zhejiang Province's territorial waters. Fishermen from Songjiang cross the provincial boundary to build nets and fish, which not only cuts off the source of fish, but also obstructs traffic, which is not allowed by law. Moreover, Article 4, Paragraph 1, Item 1 and Article 6 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Fishery Law clearly stipulate that for fishery operations that lay fishing gear on a certain water surface, it is necessary to submit an application to the主管官署 (competent authorities) for approval and registration before entering the fishery. The Jiangsu fishermen have neither applied for registration nor crossed the boundary to build nets, which have not been demolished for a long time. The livelihoods of our people have been severely damaged, and thousands of fishermen will inevitably become hungry beggars. We have always admired your association for upholding justice. It is difficult to sit idly by and watch the fishermen from the neighboring province rely on their power to cross the boundary and build windows and nets without authorization, which harms the fishery of our province. Therefore, we specially telegraph your association to quickly forward this to the competent authorities, order the Songjiang Fishery Association to dismantle the windows and nets, and prohibit them from building them again in the future, so as to maintain livelihoods and facilitate traffic. We look forward to your prompt action. We remain, Zhejiang Pinghu County Fishery Association Preparatory Director Pan Qineng kowtows."</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangda Steamer, One Third-Class Passenger Missing, Speaks with a Hubei Accent, About 30 Years Old, The Company's Lost and Found Office Seeks Claim of Abandoned Items</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangda steamer, which departed from Shanghai to Hankou on the 6th of this month, had a passenger who spoke with a Hubei accent, was about 30 years old, and was traveling in berth number 148 in the third-class cabin to Hankou. On the afternoon of the 9th, after the ship left Jiujiang, during ticket inspection, it was discovered that the passenger was not on board. The service staff Yang Dongshan immediately identified the entire ship and searched, but there was no trace. Whether he went ashore or accidentally fell into the water could not be proven. The captain immediately reported to the captain and the leader of the military police platoon and the New Transport Association inspector, etc., and inspected the passenger's berth. There were ten items of clothing and one yuan in legal tender left behind. After the ship arrived in Hankou, the abandoned items were deposited with the Hankou branch of the China Merchants Bureau, and notices were posted at the entrances of the Shanghai and Hankou bureaus, limiting the passenger or his family to claim them at the Hankou branch within ten days from the date of the notice.</p>
<h3>Li Xiaobao's Incitement to Rob a Gun Case, Two Major Criminals Arrested, Shi Dachengzi and Yang Defu Both Acknowledge Correspondence with Li Xiaobao</h3>
<p>Li Xiaobao, the leader of the detective team of the Ximen Branch of the Public Security Bureau, was involved in a case in March of this year in which he incited his party members to rob the police officers of the Public Security Bureau of their pistols on Gonghe Xin Road and Baoxing Road in Zhabei. Leader Li abandoned his post and fled. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau has arrested the suspect Xu Xueqin and detained him for investigation. It is now learned that Liang Yu, the leader of the detective team of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, has found that Yang Defu and Shi Dachengzi (also known as Shi Wenyu), who were accomplices of Li Xiaobao, fled to Wuxi by car after the incident, transferred to Changzhou, and recently, Yang Defu, using the alias Chen Jinsheng, sent a letter from Changzhou to Li Xiaobao to secretly exchange information. Therefore, detectives were secretly dispatched to follow him to Changzhou and arrest Shi Dachengzi. According to Shi, Yang Defu had secretly returned to Shanghai the night before and was hiding at No. 583 Maqi Road in the Public Concession. The detectives then brought Shi Dachengzi back to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. Liang Yu, the team leader, and team member Han Ruisheng reported to the Gordon Road Patrol Station at about 11:00 PM the night before, and together with Chinese Detective Chief Zhu Mengwei, secretly went to No. 583 Maqi Road, arrested Yang Defu, and took him to the patrol station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the patrol station, stated the previous situation, saying that at 11:00 PM last night, the personnel of the Public Security Bureau brought the two criminals, Shi Dachengzi and Xin Kun, to the patrol station to request assistance in arresting Yang Defu. The patrol station then dispatched detectives to go to No. 583 Maqi Road with the personnel and arrested Yang. At that time, Yang denied everything, but Shi Dachengzi confessed that Yang was indeed present when the police officer's pistol was robbed and had a confession. It was found that the defendant fled to Changzhou after the case and corresponded with Li Xiaobao, the leader of the detective team of the Ximen Branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, to exchange information, because Li instructed his party members to rob the police officer's firearms, preparing to falsely accuse good residents of being thieves in the future, so that he could gain credit for it. Subsequently, Liang Yu, the leader of the detective team of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, filed a case, requesting permission to transfer the suspect in order to investigate and retrieve the stolen firearms based on the confession. However, due to time constraints, the official letter was not prepared today and will be submitted later. In addition, the arrested criminal Shi Dachengzi confessed that he was from Funing, 41 years old, and proved that when the pistol was robbed, Yang Defu, Xu Xueqin, and I were all together, etc. When Yang Defu was questioned, he confessed to the robbery and that he asked someone in Changzhou to write a letter to Li Xiaobao. Judge Huang Risheng verified the confession and ordered that Yang Defu be handed over to the personnel of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to be brought back for investigation.</p>

<h3>Telephone Company Clarifies Misunderstandings with Users</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company issued a statement yesterday to eliminate misunderstandings among some users: "Recently, newspapers have carried news that various associations or groups have notified their members to stop paying telephone bills in the hope of further reducing the current new telephone rate. However, according to the investigation of telephone experts last year, including famous Chinese experts, they all believe that the current method of calculating by call is sufficient to reduce the burden on those who use the telephone less. The investigation report was also approved by the Public Works Departments of the Public Concession and the French Concession. In fact, the report had indeed taken into account the recession in Shanghai in recent years and reduced the price to the lowest possible level. Even the Shanghai Telephone Company cannot obtain the benefits it should have obtained under the contract. Although various groups may have asked their members not to pay telephone bills, as far as the Shanghai Telephone Company knows, the groups themselves and their principals all pay on time. Therefore, users who do not pay their telephone bills are only sacrificing their own credit and being fooled. The new rate currently implemented in Shanghai is already much lower than those of other cities with automatic telephone equipment. Therefore, the number of users is increasing day by day. In the three or four months after the new rate was implemented, thousands of people have automatically requested to have telephones installed. This is clear proof that the new rate is sympathetic to the general public in Shanghai. Furthermore, the accuracy of the number of uses is another concern for users. According to the record sheets used by the Shanghai Telephone Company, they are absolutely the same as those used by the largest cities in the world. The satisfaction of its services and the accuracy of the records have been proven. The call record of this electric meter is only recorded on the meter of the caller after the telephone is connected and there is a reply. It is not recorded on the meter of the receiver. If the telephone number you want to call is being used or there is no reply, it is not recorded. In addition, there are free call methods. For example, calling the Shanghai Telephone Company's various departments (94090), the telephone number inquiry office, (09) the repair department, (01) the emergency telephone, (00) is not charged. If you want to talk to someone outside the concession, such as Nanshi or Zhabei in the Chinese area (02), long-distance calls (03), in addition to paying as originally scheduled, will not be recorded on the meter."</p>
<h3>Commodity Inspection Bureau Broadcasts U.S. and Japanese Silk Prices, Broadcasting Report Starting Tomorrow Afternoon</h3>
<p>China's silk exports have been greatly affected by the global recession. Last autumn, the American recovery movement took effect, and silk sales suddenly became active, accounting for the second-highest export position, which can be said to be a good phenomenon. Now that the new season has begun, it will inevitably be in full bloom. In view of this, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, in order to ensure that both buyers and sellers truly understand foreign silk prices and market trends, has requested the Broadcasting Station of the Ministry of Communications (frequency 1300 degrees) to broadcast the silk prices in New York in the United States and Yokohama in Japan in both ordinary language and Mandarin Chinese at 11:55 AM every day starting on the 25th of this month. All silk manufacturers and industry members in this city and other cities should listen on time, so that there will be fair prices that can be used as a standard to avoid the situation of hoarding and suppressing prices. This is truly a great benefit to the silk industry. Those who operate it should pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau Completes Dredging of Zhaojia Canal</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau was ordered to dredge Zhaojia Canal at the end of January of this year. At the beginning of February, it organized an office. Director Shen appointed Xu Guanyi, the head of the Second Section, as the principal, and Pan Hongding and Zhang Qiwen, municipal committee members of Gaoxing and Luxing districts, as deputy directors. Wang Chongshan, director of the Donggou police station, was also hired as a deputy director to jointly promote the work. All the enclosed areas to be requisitioned were the three围 (encircles) of Gaoxing District, the 24th 围, the 28th 围, the 21st 围, the 22nd 围, the 52nd 围, and the 11th 围, the 18th 围, and the 17th 围 of Luxing District. Since the start of construction, the directors of each 围 have been working hard in requisitioning labor, and the conscripted laborers have also been enthusiastic, so the progress has been quite smooth. The entire project was completed and opened on the 6th of this month. The office will be closed at the end of this month. In order to solemnly protect the rights and interests of the conscripted laborers, the bureau has also issued the following notice regarding the households that cannot provide labor and pay a substitute labor fee: "Regarding the requisition of labor to dredge Zhaojia Canal, it has been stipulated that each mu of land in the 3rd围, 11th围, 18th围, and 24th围 should provide 2.4 cubic meters of earthwork, and each mu of land in the 21st围, 22nd围, 28th围, and 51st围 should provide 1.8 cubic meters of earthwork. However, the 17th围 has been reduced to 0.8 cubic meters of earthwork per mu due to the usual practice of not serving labor. If the households in each map that should be conscripted choose to pay a substitute labor fee, they should pay 15 cents of legal currency per cubic meter (ie, 3.6 cents per mu for each围 of the 3rd, 11th, 18th, and 24th围, 2.7 cents per mu for each围 of the 21st, 22nd, 28th, and 52nd围, and 1.2 cents per mu for the 17th围), and should obtain a formal receipt as proof in accordance with Announcement No. 270 previously issued by this bureau. All households should carefully calculate the substitute labor fee they have paid in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations. If the substitute labor fee paid exceeds the above-mentioned regulations or a formal receipt has not been obtained, it is obviously being fooled and should be allowed to file a complaint with this bureau at any time to eliminate long-standing malpractices and prevent excessive collection, so as to conform to the original purpose of managing farmland water conservancy. This is hereby announced." It is also heard that the bureau will inform the Land Bureau of the fields that should be exchanged due to the straightening of the river channel and will provide convenience to the owners. As for the laborers who contributed to this river project, the bureau is currently submitting a report to the municipal government to request that they be awarded separately in order to encourage them.</p>
<h3>Principal Offender in Assassination Case, Liu Xing San Sentenced to Life Imprisonment, Due to Extortion Failure and Concealment of Another Man's Wife Case</h3>
<p>Wang Baoshan, a Funing native living on Tianbao Road in northern Shanghai who worked for a cleaning company, was shot and killed by an enemy due to a dispute over business on the afternoon of February 28, 1930. Subsequently, the principal offender Dai Wenzao and Dai's three apprentices, Wang Fuguang and Shi Fulin, were arrested and sentenced to death, life imprisonment, and 12 years of imprisonment, respectively. Dai was executed last year, and Wang and Shi also died one after another. There was still a principal offender on the run, Liu Liuguanzi, also known as Liu Xing San, who was hiding in the home of his apprentice Wu Xiaokai. He then extorted Wu unsuccessfully and concealed Wu's wife, so Wu reported him to the patrol station. Because of the crime in the inland area, he was transferred to the Nanshi Local Court for investigation and prosecution. After repeated hearings, the facts were found to be true, and a sentence was pronounced yesterday, sentencing Liu Liuguanzi, also known as Liu Xing San, to life imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Who Exactly Strangled Tang Zhenyou? Accused of Forcibly Taking Another Man's Wife as Concubine, Defendant Denies Murder</h3>
<p>Tang Yitian, from Shandong (36 years old), lived by selling vegetables. His home was near the Scissors Bridge on Meiqiao Road in the Nanshi area. He was usually frugal and had saved a little money. In the spring of this year, he married a woman from his hometown, Wu Lindi, as his wife. However, Wang Chenghe (also known as Wang Laosan), who lived with Tang and was Tang Yitian's mentor, saw that Tang's wife, Wu, was young and beautiful and had designs on her. On the sixth day of last month, he gathered a group of people, drove Tang Yitian away, and forcibly took Wu Lindi as a concubine. Tang Zhenyou, Tang's nephew, learned of this and, dissatisfied, argued with Wang Chenghe. Wang Chenghe harbored a deep grudge and plotted murder. That night, he invited Bian Tingshun, Han Shaolun, and others to sneak to the front of Tang Zhenyou's house and lie in ambush, planning to harm him. Unexpectedly, Tang went outside late at night to urinate. Wang and the others rushed upon him, strangled him to death with a rope, and then abandoned the body in a nearby ditch. The next morning, Tang Yitian discovered that his nephew, Tang Zhenyou, had been murdered. He and the deceased's father, Tang Yili, reported the information to the Ximen Branch Bureau, which ordered the police to detain Wang Chenghe, Bian Tingshun, Han Shaolun, and Tang's wife, Tang Wu Lindi, and send them to the local court for investigation and prosecution. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhao Yongzhou opened the court. Tang Yitian and Tang Yili appeared in court to recount the previous events and request justice. When questioned, Wang Chenghe stated that he was 40 years old and worked as a lane watchman. On the sixth day of last month, Tang Yitian owed him rent, so he asked him to pay. Because he had no money to pay, he went to a friend in Zhabei to borrow money. He did not forcibly take his wife. As for Tang Zhenyou's death, he was wrongly accused of being the perpetrator. Bian Qianxun stated that he was 45 years old, from Xuzhou, and a small vendor. On the sixth day of last month, Tang owed Wang money, and an argument broke out. He and others were there to mediate and reconcile. He really did not know who murdered Tang Zhenyou. Han Shaolun stated that he was 30 years old, from Suqian, and made a living as a small vendor. The rest of his testimony was roughly consistent with Bian Tingshun's. At this point, the court decided that further investigation was needed and adjourned the hearing.

<h3>Xia Fubao Sues Zheng Mengxia, Et Al. for Debt. The Salary of a Musician and a Loan. Compensation for a Raincoat Bitten by a Dog</h3>
<p>Zheng Mengxia, a female actress who used to perform at the Tianchan Stage, and her husband, Chen Gaoting, resided at No. A405, Huanlong Road, French Concession. While Zheng was performing at the Tianchan, she hired Xia Fubin from Suzhou as her musician at a monthly salary of 60 yuan. Recently, Zheng has left the Tianchan and joined Yi Hua Company as a movie star and also dances at the New Light. Xia Fubao, the now-retired musician, has filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the Second Special District Court against Chen Gaoting and Zheng Mengxia, seeking recovery of unpaid wages, loans, and damages. The complaint states that Zheng Mengxia performed at the Tianchan Stage in January of this year and hired the plaintiff as her musician at a monthly salary of 60 yuan. At the end of February, a dispute arose over the payment of wages, and the plaintiff was dismissed. He received 50 yuan of the two months' wages he was owed, leaving a balance of 30 yuan. There was also a bounced check for 30 yuan that was promised to be paid immediately, but repeated demands were ignored. Later, it was agreed to be paid on the afternoon of April 29th. The plaintiff went to collect the money as scheduled, but the defendants allowed their dog to bite the plaintiff's raincoat, causing it to be torn. The raincoat was originally worth 17 yuan and 50 cents. The matter was reported to the Lujiawan Police Station, which summoned the defendant Chen Gaoting, ordering him to compensate the price, but he refused to comply. In addition, Zheng Mengxia borrowed 1 yuan and 20 cents from the plaintiff while at the Tianchan, which has not been returned. Therefore, the plaintiff requests that the defendant Zheng Mengxia be ordered to repay the unpaid salary of 70 yuan, the loan of 1 yuan and 20 cents, and Chen Gaoting be ordered to compensate the damages of 17 yuan and 50 cents, as well as bear the litigation costs. The court, upon receiving the complaint, scheduled a mediation hearing. Yesterday, Judge Wu Xiaoshu summoned both parties to the Civil Seventh Court for mediation. At the appointed time, the two defendants, having been legally summoned, failed to appear. Only the plaintiff, Xia Fubin, appeared in court. The judge stated that since both defendants had failed to appear, mediation could not proceed and was declared unsuccessful. He instructed the plaintiff to file a formal lawsuit. The plaintiff stated that he had already paid the litigation costs and requested that the hearing be allowed to proceed. The court ordered that a hearing be scheduled at a later date.</p>

<h3>Chen Lijang Talks About Actively Promoting Social Education</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Education transferred Zhang Jiong, the Director of the Social Education Department, to be a Senior Secretary, and appointed Chen Lijang as the Director of the Social Education Department, Chen arrived at the Ministry a few days ago to take up his post. A reporter, in a friendly relationship, asked him for his views on social education. According to him, European countries such as Germany and France promote social education because they have preliminary basic work for eliminating illiteracy, and it is relatively easy to continue teaching. On the one hand, China is seeking to eliminate illiteracy, and on the other hand, it is seeking to continue to promote it, which is more difficult. The general psychology of people always regards general school compulsory education as important and social education as light. It is because human survival relies on food that can fill the stomach, but they do not know that the invisible air cannot be separated from it. It is no wonder that they regard school education as food and social education as air. For the sake of China's national conditions and current situation, the promotion of social education should not imitate Europe and the United States, but should be as aggressive as the Soviet Union and Turkey. Basic work (eliminating illiteracy) and continued improvement must be carried out simultaneously before it can be effective. Chen said that the first step after taking office is to actively plan to make all provinces and cities across the country promote people's schools as much as possible, search for and eliminate illiteracy, and train citizens. Because there are only 60,000,000 out-of-school children in the country's compulsory education, while the number of illiterate adults in the country is more than 24,000,000, which is four times the number of out-of-school children in compulsory education, so we must strive to promote it. The second step is to plan the entire social education, such as libraries, gymnasiums, and other social-related undertakings, so that China's social education will have considerable results within a few years, he said.</p>

<h3>Detailed Record of the Final Test of the Four-Sport Training Class Qinghua's Excellent Environment Satisfies All Athletes</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Motherland) China's track and field training class participating in the World Games is training at Tsinghua University in Peiping. Each test shows progress. Today (the 12th) was the final test. Chen Baoqiu's shot put broke the Far Eastern Games record, which was a huge gain. The test began at 4:00 PM today, with more than 1,000 spectators. Because it was far in the suburbs, sports enthusiasts in the city abandoned the spring sports meeting and made a special trip to Tsinghua to watch. Each competition was exciting, and the shot put was the most eye-catching. Fu Baolu's pole vault failed to continue the test and could not create a new record because the pole suddenly broke, which was also a shortcoming. The test results and interviews with record-breakers are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Results of Each Test</p>
<h3>Interviews with Record Breakers</h3>
<p>The track and field training class has been training at Tsinghua University in Peiping for several days, and the results have improved significantly. In the first, second, and third tests, although Jia Lianren, Wu Bixian, and others broke national records, only one person had amazing results each time. In the fourth test, Fu Baolu's pole vault broke the four-meter highest record held by Japanese athlete Taso at the Far Eastern Games. Fu's result reached a height of four meters and one five millimeters. Huang Yingjie's high hurdles, Guo Jie's discus, and Lin Shaozhou's 110-meter high hurdles also broke national records. The fifth test was the most exciting, and the shot put had particularly special gains. Chen Baoqiu became an instant sensation. His shot put result reached as far as 12 meters and 975 millimeters, breaking the 12-meter and 90-millimeter record held by Japanese Abe Ko at the Far Eastern Games. In addition, the 800-meter, javelin, high hurdles, high jump, and discus also broke national records, and the 400-meter tied the national record. Because today (the 22nd) was the last test, the reporter went to Tsinghua University again to participate in the test and interview the record-breakers. The interviews with each excellent champion are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chen Baoqiu Speaks</p>
<p>Chen Baoqiu, the shot put record breaker at the Far Eastern Games, said to the reporter: I am fortunate to have achieved results today, but I dare not say that the results are excellent. Although the Far Eastern Games record can be broken, it is difficult to have hope of participating in the World Games. The world record for shot put is 17 meters and 40 millimeters by American Tootans. Today, I only broke the 12-meter and 905-millimeter record held by Japanese Abe Ko at the Far Eastern Games. Compared to my 12-meter and 975-millimeter record today, there is only a slight improvement. Compared with American Tots, it is like a small wizard seeing a great wizard. (Note) Chen's first test was 12 meters and 745 millimeters for shot put, breaking Jin Guo's record of 20 meters and 690 millimeters. Chen is a native of Guangxi, 25 years old, and currently works in the General Affairs Department of the Hankou General Bureau of the Pinghan Railway.</p>
<p>Fu Baolu Speaks</p>
<p>Fu Baolu, the pole vault record breaker at the Far Eastern Games, said to the reporter: Although I broke the Far Eastern Games record, I am afraid I will not be able to achieve considerable hope in participating in the World Games. My score in the 9th Far Eastern Games was only 3 meters and 64 centimeters, and in the 10th Far Eastern Games, it was more than 3 meters and 80 centimeters. Recently, I reached 4 meters and 15 millimeters, breaking the 4-meter record held by Japanese athlete Nishida at the Far Eastern Games. Since entering the track and field training class, I have felt that the environment in Tsinghua is better than in Shanghai, so I have achieved considerable results after training. However, there are no good poles in Pingjin. The pole I used today has broken, so there is no progress. Japanese poles are better because the Japanese pay more attention to pole vault, so the nature and manufacturing method of the poles have been studied. The world record for pole vault is 4 meters and 12 centimeters by American Miller, which is far better than my score. (Note) Fu is a native of Binjiang, Jilin, 23 years old, and currently works for an airline. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Finance Large Accounts Slightly Selling Off Spot Gold Recedes by Eight Cents - Very Little Trading This Morning</h3>
<p>The gold market fell yesterday because buyers were cautious. In fact, large accounts did not want to operate, and the market situation was difficult to reverse. There was little trading in the morning, and the prospects were even more sluggish. If life did not change, there was little chance of change. At the beginning of the morning, overseas silver market reported British silver falling and American silver flat, and forward silver prices were unchanged, falling by up to 3%. Exchange rates were slightly longer. London raw gold was unchanged. The Central Bank's listed price was announced, with both British and American silver flat.

The HSBC Bank's listed price was announced, with both British and American silver flat, and the silver equalization tax was reduced by 0.25. At this time, the demand for supply was even rarer, and the market hovered around 38 yuan for a long time. Later, due to a lack of maintenance, large accounts slightly sold off, resulting in a tired closing in the afternoon. The spread premium fell to 3 yuan and 3 cents yesterday.

The morning water replenishment was 1133 yuan. The spot market situation was even more stable due to the lower Si Tie price. Tianjin goods were plus 10 yuan, and Haichi goods were plus 9 yuan, but there were no transactions. The swap period yesterday turned tired from Huixiang's Tiejin. It is estimated that Duofang Chunyuan Yong paid Huixiang 56 articles, 3 yuan and 3 cents. Yuan Yi paid Qingfa Yong 7 articles, at the same price.</p>

<h3>Banks and Merchants Have Different Pulls and Stuffs Exchange Rates Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>The exchange rate was flat yesterday because Chinese merchants and banks had different pulls and stuffs, and the Hong Kong market was also stable. The morning process was slightly trance-like. At the beginning of the morning, the overseas silver market reported that the London Datiao recent term shrank by 0.0625, the forward term shrank by 0.125, and the Foot Place said that there were a few transactions after the closing at the listed price, but the last buyer at the listed price, and the seller was waiting above 0.0625. The New York silver market was unchanged. The Montreal forward silver price was unchanged, falling by up to 3%. London raw gold was Xun. The British exchange rate against the US dollar grew by 625, and against the French franc rose by 7 pounds sound. The US exchange rate against the British pound rose by 5625, and against the French franc shrank by 1875. The Central Bank's listing was announced, with both British and American silver flat. The Customs Gold Unit was Xun. The exchange rate opened in the morning with a recent selling price of 1 shilling, 2 pence, 375, and the US exchange rate at 29 yuan and 75, compared to the previous closing, with both British and American silver flat. After the opening, banks had mutual exchanges. Although Hesheng Foreign Bank and the Central Bank stuffed shillings first, the silver leveling tax was revealed to have shrunk by 0.25 because the banks exchanged with each other. After this, there was still no impact, and it was delayed until the afternoon closing. The recent selling price was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 375, and the US exchange rate was 29 yuan and 75, compared to the previous closing, with both British and American silver flat. The forward term was also the same. The British and American exchange rates were pulled by Citibank and stuffed by the American exchange rate, making 4 yuan, 9 cents, and 7 and a half points in May. Chinese merchants had little entry and exit. The Central Bank forcefully stuffed the current shilling, while the Japanese Bank pulled. The transactions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The British exchange rate opened in the morning with a recent selling price of 1 shilling, 2 pence, 375. HSBC sold to Youli 25 and 3125 pairs in September, and Hua pulled the same price in May. Hesheng sold 375 in May to Youli Mitsui, and the Central sold 375 to Citibank. Meijiali sold to Zhengjin. The Central sold to Youli. Datong sold to Zhengjin. The Central sold 375 in spot to Zhengjin.

<h3>Securities Public Bonds Have a Chronic Short Squeeze</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Commercial Securities Exchange, because there were only two days left in the futures trading this month, most people in the market were pessimistic due to the eventful environment. Therefore, floating shorts gradually became crowded, evolving into a chronic short squeeze. It was relatively lively for Changshi Kongtou to swap periods. The market price formed a uniform near-high and low speed. The market price of the five unified public bonds was consistently inverted. However, this situation is very easy to lead to Duotou swapping periods, because Gongyouhe can also seek profit. Temporarily, due to the squeezing relationship of chips, or when breaking away from the environmental situation, they compete for temporary lengths. Yesterday, after the opening, it was unanimously increased by two or three cents. The A-type short squeeze in this month was 4 cents high. The second market short squeeze did not see a rest. It rose by 1 or 2 cents. There were no large quantities of entry and exit on the table. The scattered transactions were relatively lively. The opening in the afternoon was still a trend of near-rising and far-falling. The A-type in this month once reached 68 yuan and 9 cents. All gangs of Kongtou were willing to swap periods and were unwilling to cut them. They could see the support of the people. The closing had become chaotic. Duokong swapped periods with each other, so highs and lows also rose and fell with each other. The number was also very small. As a result, except for 96, one of them rose by 1 to 2 cents to half a yuan, and the total number of transactions was 80.25 million yuan. The results of its rise and fall are compared in the table on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan).</p>
<p>Also, on the 22nd, the London China Bond market reported that the Beijing-Shanghai Railway bonds rose by another pound to 75 pounds and 50. The British issued good after-sale detections also rose by one pound to 89 pounds and 50. The rest were unchanged. However, the Longhai bonds returned a small pound and 50, it is said.</p>
<h3>Yarn Cotton Most of the Arbitrage Yarn Was Delivered The Near-Term Yarn Shape is Weak Buyers are Working Hard to Absorb The People's Hearts Still Feel Slack</h3>
<p>The yarn market has recently become softer. Although buyers are prepared to receive goods, most of the general arbitrage goods have been delivered before. At the same time, the factory still has 1,200 bales of new yarn to deliver and release. Therefore, the pressure is heavy, and people's hearts have been frustrated again, but the Duotou side is still safe and unmoved. Only Monday is left as the last peaceful and prosperous business day of Li Yue.</p>
<p>Falling More Than One Yuan in Three Months</p>
<p>Before the opening of the standard yarn market, the buying side worked hard to receive it this month because the delivery deadline was approaching, but there was enough yarn in the warehouse, and the factory also had Samsung, Big Zeppelin, Shuanglu, Jincheng and other yarn delivered. As a result, the popularity was lazy, and the first three months fell by one yuan and two cents together, and the distance fell by five or six cents. The second and third plates were half-set, and the results were all close to five or six cents and five cents lower than the closing price on the previous day, and the distance fell by seven, eight, and nine cents. After the opening in the afternoon, the market situation was calm, with ups and downs between several cents, but large accounts slightly purchased, and as a result, each month rose by 1, 2, and 3 cents compared to the closing price in the morning. It was found that 1,710 bales were sold by Yuda, 1,000 bales by Deda, 3,450 bales by Gengfeng, 9 bales by Yuan Yi, 1,000 bales by Dachangcheng, 2,500 bales by Changfeng, 1,400 bales by Yongda, 1,050 bales by Tonghe, and 1,700 bales by Xincheng. 600 bales were purchased by Jinchang, 500 bales by Dafeng, 800 bales by Dafu, 850 bales by Chengji, 1,910 bales by Tongji, 1,600 bales by Mingde, 700 bales by Juxing, 650 bales by Minghua, 650 bales by Renfeng, 1,650 bales by Shengyou, and 1,300 bales by Runkang. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales are Clearer Than on the 10th</p>
<p>It was found that the statistics of all gangs throughout the day were 405 bales, and the selling price was similar to that of the previous day. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Nanjing 3 Shantou 50 Guangdong 15 Yunnan 150 Mainland 215 Same Industry 30 Changsha 13</p>
<h3>Forward Flower Market Prices Slightly Higher</h3>
<p>The cotton market is slightly higher. Although the spot delivery volume for today is 56,000 piculs, of which 20,000 piculs are fine-staple cotton sold at a higher price than standard cotton. These have already been withdrawn and not delivered. The forward American-Oriental Bank is making profits by covering short positions, so the market sentiment is slightly firm.</p>
<p>Standard Flower First Falls, Then Rises</p>
<p>The spot flower market opened before noon. American cotton rose and fell by one to four points, Indian cotton rose by 0.05 to 0.1 rupees, and Da Yan's three-grade flower fell by 3.4 cents. Market sentiment was mediocre, with a slight drop of 1.5 cents initially. When trading shifted to the forward market, it tended to be firm and higher. By the second and third rounds, due to the weakness of the yarn market, the situation was bleak. As a result, each month's closing price was down by 0.05 to 0.15 cents compared to the previous day's close. The market opened in the afternoon, and trading was quiet. American-Oriental Bank and Jardine Matheson were actively covering short positions in June and July contracts. The closing situation in the third session was still good. As a result, each month's price rose by 0.05 to 0.15 cents compared to the morning's closing price. It is reported that 1,400 piculs were sold by Yu Da, 1,000 piculs by De Da, 1,200 piculs by Ji Feng, 2,800 piculs by Da Feng, 1,100 piculs by He Xing, 1,500 piculs by Sen Kang, 1,700 piculs by Da Chang Cheng, 4,500 piculs by Da Chang, 1,800 piculs by Yuan Xing Chang, 1,600 piculs by Yi Chang, 1,700 piculs by Run Kang, 1,200 piculs. 1,300 piculs were bought by Heng Yi, 3,900 piculs by Mei Ji, 1,500 piculs by Ming Hua, 2,800 piculs by Shen Chang, 1,000 piculs by Tong He, 4,300 piculs by Xin Cheng, 1,800 piculs by Yi Kang. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Demand from Cotton Mills is Still Good</p>
<p>Current cotton consumption is normal, and demand from mills is still considerable. The source of Yao flower is 280 bales.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Only Rises in July Contracts</h3>
<p>Yesterday, when the American cotton market opened, prices for each month rose and fell by two points. Market sentiment was focused on the sale of May contracts by cotton hoarding firms, but the amount sold was absorbed. Market conditions for other months were sluggish. Retail investors closed out long positions, and cotton farmers' hedging sales and foreign merchants' sales were offset by purchases from the same industry. The July contract rose by three points due to speculative buying. Off-market trading was still sparse. The closing was stable. Spot prices fell by three points, while futures prices rose by three points to fall by four points. British cotton spot prices rose by two points, and futures prices rose by one to two points. Indian cotton was initially firm due to speculative buying, but later fell due to cotton farmers' hedging sales and European exporters' local sales and returns. As a result, Pingguoer rose by 0.25 to fall by 0.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 0.25 to 0.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegram of the 22nd)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the July-August Bailuoxi flower on the 23rd was 199 rupees, down 0.25 rupees from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Three Grades of Yarn and Cotton Decline Together</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from Osaka on the 23rd, three-grade futures yarn fell by 1.5 to 2.1 yuan. The near-month contract was 192.5 yuan, and the far-month contract was 191.1 yuan. Futures cotton fell by 0.15 to 0.4 yuan. The near-month contract was 62.45 yuan, and the far-month contract was 58.55 yuan.</p>
<p>Stockpiles of Wooden Frame Flowers Are Particularly Abundant - Survey on May 22nd -</p>
<h3>Recent News on New Cotton Conditions in Various Regions</h3>
<p>According to a recent report from a certain cotton industry organization, the conditions of new cotton in various regions are roughly as follows: Henan, Shaanxi, and other places in North China have benefited from rainfall. Jiangsu and Zhejiang do not seem to have any special increase, at most about 15%. Due to the cold winter, pest damage has been reduced in Hubei, Anhui, and Hunan provinces, and cotton prices are high, so farmers are all engaged in planting cotton. However, because they are located in the Yangtze River basin, recent water rises may inundate cotton fields. In Shaanxi Province, the area of opium poppy cultivation has decreased, and as a result of encouraging cotton planting, the cotton field area is increasing daily.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Market Concentrated in Hankou, Sales Sharply Decline in Both North and South</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton market was flat and weak, and actual sales were only sporadic. Sales in North and South China have sharply declined this year, so both Chinese and foreign factories have deepened their attention to Hankou in Central China. Last year, Da Cheng Factory established a branch in Hankou to transfer goods for promotion, and the results were significant. Recently, a large number of printed and finished piece goods, printed satin, calico, poplin, bleached cloth, striped bleached cloth, blue cloth, and other goods were shipped there. Japanese Shanghai Yarn Factory, Chinese Yongan, Dasheng, Qingfeng, Sulun, and Changyi's small-scale dyeing and weaving factories have all increased the establishment of marketing offices. Recently, a large number of cloth, fine cloth, poplin, striped bleached cloth, bleached cloth, and other goods have also been shipped there for dumping, so the outflow of goods from Hankou has suddenly surged, reaching more than a thousand pieces in the past two weeks, making the competition in Hankou this year even more acute.</p>
<p>Correction: We have received a letter from Yufeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, stating that in the "Piece Goods" column of your newspaper on May 9th, the price of "Baxi Plain Poplin" was listed as 2.525 cents. The "Baxi" trademark belongs to a small factory product, and there was no sale at that price on that day. It is suspected to be an error in reporting, and they request a correction, etc. This newspaper stated in the news "Cotton Cloth Still Restricted by Yarn and Cotton" on that day that there were two types of striped silk market prices and two types of plain poplin market prices. One of the plain poplins was "Jiashi Plain Poplin" at 2.9 cents, and the other was "Baxi Yarn Plain Poplin" at 2.525 cents. However, since the letter claims that there was no such price on that day, it should be corrected.</p>
<h3>Transactions in Valetino Serge Are Brisk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Valetino Serge was sold in large quantities at the association, and many woolen cloth shops sent out goods. The Western-style clothing industry is booming, and the sales of pure white are particularly broad. Most sellers insist on adding other colors before releasing goods, and buyers who want to buy pure white must add 2 cents per yard. The colors of straw yellow and straw green are still being sought after by the Nanjing gang, and the selling price is more than one yuan per yard higher than last year. Yesterday, the wholesale price of ordinary brand Valetino Serge was 4.5 yuan, and the sample yard sold by broken goods shops was 5.23 yuan. The output of dark blue is slower, so it can be cheaper by 3 or 4 cents per yard.</p>
<h3>Grains, Flour Mills Continue to Dump Goods Vigorously, Market Prices Finally Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening in the morning, prices for each month initially fell, then stabilized, and finally fell sharply again. When prices opened, the quoted price of foreign wheat was slightly better by 8 cents to 2 cents or so. Since the weather was still good, although the opening price was slightly lower than the previous day by 1 or 2 cents, after the second round, prices rebounded by 1 or 2 cents because of speculative covering and fewer offers from sellers. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market for each month collapsed again. Due to the mills' vigorous dumping, most people, looking at the poor spot sales, also stepped down, so the long positions of customers also continued to be sold. The lowest records were seen for all months up to July. Because it was rumored that starting next week, 1.5 cents would be added to the standard price and cash withdrawals could be made, the June contract turned slightly stable amidst the adverse environment. However, industry insiders speculate that the June contract is still higher than the forward contract. If spot sales fail to turn around, it is feared that prices will gradually converge.</p>
<h3>The Wheat Market Must Depend on the Weather</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after the opening in the morning, prices for each month generally showed a hovering trend. The quoted price of foreign wheat fluctuated little. Insiders and outsiders had different views due to consecutive days of rapid declines, fearing the same trend. Although trading was brisk, there was little difference in prices. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market atmosphere for each month was similar to that in the morning. According to the current situation, if the weather remains good, the wheat market should be seen as weak. In the spot wheat market, the mills' appetite has been flat in recent days, and market prices have been greatly loosened step by step. However, there are very few formal transactions. High-quality goods have fallen into the 4-yuan range. Industry insiders speculate that Chen wheat has the potential to fall to 4.2 yuan. Yesterday, it was heard that 3,000 bags of Shan Yao Bay wheat were priced at 4.33 yuan to 4.33 yuan, handled by the Biao Xin Factory.</p>
<p>The American wheat market was affected by dry weather reports and the May contract, and prices fluctuated. Canadian wheat exports are weak, and new wheat months will soon encounter hedging pressure.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Gang Actively Purchases Medium and Lower Grade Kexian, Prices Can Be Stabilized</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Kexian market was affected by the hot weather, and sellers were particularly eager to sell. Zhejiang oil opened at 10.089 yuan the day before, but yesterday it opened with oil that seemed to be heating up, equivalent to 9.65 yuan. Other medium and lower grades were also sold at lower prices, but high-quality goods were still unwilling to sell at low prices. Moreover, the Ningbo gang actively purchased Zhongguan rice, so the prices of medium and lower grade rice were stabilized. The Ningbo gang purchased 2,000 bags of late-season machine rice. The appetite in this street was also slightly active. Jiangxi rice was offered for 4,800 bags, and Zhejiang second-grade oil for 347 bags.</p>
<h3>Sales of Thin Rice Decline Among North China Gangs</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 20 sources arrived (a total of more than 5,000 dan). The sales market in this street was still normal. Due to the lack of transportation, the North China gangs only purchased 400 to 500 bags of thin rice and more than 100 bags of thick japonica rice. Therefore, although the market for thick early japonica rice and thin rice did not rise or fall much, the situation has already shown weakness. Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan also showed fatigue.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 24 sources arrived from various routes in Hexia. Sales of various goods in the market were still weak. High-quality white japonica rice has not yet opened. The price of medium and lower grades was slightly lower by 3 or 4 cents. The retail appetite for thin rice was still good, and the price was stable. The price of Yin Bianyuan showed a tired trend. Yangyou was stable, and the price of Bodu Kexian was tired by several cents. The prices of other goods still looked tired.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Actual Sales Are Brisk, Stocks Are Scarce, and Silk Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Bridge Brand No. 110 is in limited supply, and it is difficult to transport private goods again, so hoarding firms are vying to absorb them, and prices are soaring again. Today's price is 355 to 360 yuan. Those offered by customs are 370 yuan, with about 40 boxes sold. European dull silk has been shipped in large quantities to Hong Kong and Dalian, so existing stocks are also in short supply. The market is looking good, and actual sales are also very active. The current price of 25 boxes of Jinyi Brand light silk, ordered by the local company No. 75, imported from Japan yesterday, is 530 yuan. Private smuggling to North China is more difficult, and prices in various cities have also risen by 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Qimen New Black Tea Is on the Market</h3>
<p>Qimen new black tea was officially released yesterday by the promotion team of the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea General Sales Office, totaling more than 7,300 boxes, of which there are many high-quality goods from Qimen's Southwest Road. Various foreign firms inspected them and were extremely busy. However, because there were too many customers, it was not easy to taste. The new market must wait until next week before it can open. 3,000 boxes of Ningzhou black tea from Jiangxi Province have also been transported here and samples can be released tomorrow. On the 22nd, China Tea opened Pingshui pearl tea at 56 yuan and 58 yuan. Yesterday, Zhao Gao continued to handle dozens of pieces at a price of 60 yuan. After the Tongfu opened the Zhenjie from that route, Baocheng China Tea and other firms also started to follow, with prices ranging from 32 yuan to 37 yuan.</p>
<h3>Green Tea Sales Are Very Active This Week, Zhuji Mao Tea Inferior Goods Are Sluggish</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Tea Merchants Association, the sales of green tea were very active this week. The Sian-Huzhou Zhenmei and Chouxin, which have a clear water and strong taste, were sold as soon as they were sampled. It is estimated that Xiehe and other firms sold a total of more than 1,600 boxes at prices ranging from 64 yuan to 78 yuan. As for the inferior goods made from Suian Zhuji Mao tea, few people asked about them. After Yihua made Suian Zhenmei at 85 yuan, Xiehe Fushi Baocheng and other firms continued to start handling them, with an estimated transaction of more than 600 boxes. The Tunxi Zaoshui Zhenmei and Chouxin arrived on the 21st, and 345 boxes were sold in one trade. Because the shipping schedule for the goods that arrived later had passed, there were no continued sales.</p>
<h3>Oil Market, Actual Sales Are Not Smooth, Sesame Oil Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Although the sesame oil market has fallen by 3 yuan from the highest price, it is still difficult to promote actual sales due to the high price level. At this time when the raw soybean oil market is also gradually being reduced, people's hearts are even weaker. Although the price of Huaiyuan goods fell to 26.3 yuan at the beginning of this week, the sellers were still eager to sell, and buyers took advantage of the situation to cut prices, resulting in a more severe decline. Yesterday, Huai Guo oil opened again to 24.5 yuan, and the market unexpectedly plunged by 1.8 yuan, with more than 600 cans traded, sold by scattered sales in this street.</p>
<h3>Soybean Oil Is Again Manipulated by Dalian</h3>
<p>The soybean oil market has been less active, but yesterday the market was suddenly manipulated by the surge in Dalian, causing the market to rebound. Yesterday morning, the market price first rose by 1 dime, and then rose another 1 dime in the afternoon, rising by 2 dimes in total. Soybean oil was continuously traded for 450 pieces. According to the above trading volume, the sales market is still sluggish.</p>
<h3>Seafood, Shrimp Tails Are Moved to Cold Storage, Fortunately Stocks Are Not Abundant, Jinshan Tails Are Less Than 100 Barrels</h3>
<p>Due to the gradually hot weather, shrimp tails are very easy to change color and smell, so customers from various routes, large and medium-sized, are wary and have temporarily reduced their purchases. They will never make many purchases until the autumn is cool. Now that the business is in the off-season, those with more inventory are preparing to store them in cold storage and sell them again in the summer. However, the stocks of each item are not abundant. 9 boxes of new Jin Gou tails arrived earlier and have already been sold out. Later, the continued arrival, old goods on the street floor, there are only thirty or forty boxes, Jinshan tails, the whole street is less than 100 barrels (yesterday's other newspaper published a stock of more than 500 barrels, which is a false report), the rest of the other grades are even rarer. Yesterday, the market was offering high Chen Jin Gou tails at 108 yuan, ordinary goods at 105 yuan, Jinshan tails at 125 or 6 yuan in the middle, small ones at 115 yuan, Tian Bian tails at 102 yuan, Tian Shrimp tails at 90 yuan, Hong Kong tails at 85 yuan, Xiangshan tails section cleaned at 80 yuan, Long Ya tails original goods at 45 yuan, Yuan Dong Mao at 110 yuan, Chao Bian tails at 100 yuan, Jiangbei Xiao Kai tails at 60 yuan, tail heads at 32 yuan, and other out-of-stock items. Among the various grades, the median price is lower than last week. Observing the sluggish customer sales, there is still a risk of further loosening in the future.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market, Very Few Domestic Sugar Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat and tired. The association's pricing, the current price of 24 coarse sand white spot, called 22 yuan, transshipped goods 6.7 yuan, slightly traded, compared to a small 10 cents. Dong Chibai are both called the original price, but the 8th Dongbai transshipped goods, in order to make up for the shortage, were 5 cents higher, 6.5 yuan, there were transactions. The local factory cotton white, Zhenji No. 1 is 20.4 yuan, Dihua Golden Heart No. 1 is 20.6 yuan, and the rest are returned according to. The local sugar number market only had the Bang open out, Zhichi hundreds of bags 11.5 yuan, and the rest lacked transactions (The fifty bags of Guangdong No. 4 cotton white sold the day before yesterday was erroneously written as one thousand yuan and 9th Dongbai YRO, spot goods are 21.15 yuan, which should be 21 yuan, attach this correction).</p>
<h3>North and South Goods, Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber Opened 1,600 Jars</h3>
<p>The former pair of 3,000 jars of Sichuan pickled mustard tuber, Gao Leqi pickled vegetables once called 27 yuan, did not succeed, but I didn't know that the recent market was even more tight, and yesterday and the previous day, Qian Da Chang and Shun Chang's two firms, a total of 1,600 jars were opened. The top Juyu Tongle Qi pickled vegetables opened at 28.5 yuan, followed by 27.8 yuan to 20.5 yuan, ordinary 26.8 yuan to 26.5 yuan, Fuling vegetables called 25, did not trade, rising about one yuan from before. The market of high-priced goods called 27 yuan, followed by 21.2 yuan, if the sales are smooth in the later market, it can be expected to be firm.</p>
<h3>Medium-Grade Chao Number Market Fell One Yuan</h3>
<p>Chao-According to the Shantou letter, the production price is very firm due to the lack of goods at the bottom, but the Shen market has turned quiet due to slow sales, and the trend is flat and tired. Recently, only the Ningbo Gang has been slightly active, and the rest are sporadic. The high-end market of the number market called 36.7 yuan, which is not much up or down from before, the middle market 31 yuan, the second market 11.12 yuan, slightly down one yuan from before.</p>
<h3>Hardware, The Situation of the American Society of Civil Engineers Iron Market is Gradually Consolidating</h3>
<p>200-pound American Society of Civil Engineers iron, due to the arrival of a large number of spot goods from Japan, the standard opening market was seen as weak, so the market price fell from 36 yuan to 34 yuan, reaching as much as 2 yuan. In recent days, the market situation has gradually consolidated, because no more East goods have arrived, and the price from New York has been reported to be rising (7.2 gold yuan per box), and there are not many circulating goods in the city, so people's hearts are greatly settled, and prices are gradually recovering. Currently, the price of old steel factory goods in the city is 34 yuan, new steel factory goods are sold for 33.5 yuan, and miscellaneous goods can also be sold for 30 yuan. Although the transactions of customer gangs have not yet moved, the can factories and cigarette factories on this street have quite a few decorations, and it is estimated that 400 to 500 boxes were opened yesterday, and it is heard that they were all sold by hardware numbers in the North Suzhou Road area. It has been found that there are not many new goods imported in the later batches, and the cost is also large, and the market price will be more stable.</p>

<p>Children's Special Issue</p>
<h3>Reading and Perseverance</h3>
<p>— Xie Yun</p>
<p>"If you want deep skill, an iron rod can be ground into a needle." These are two common Chinese sayings. They tell people that if they have perseverance, they can succeed in any difficult task. Children, can you all be persistent in your studies?</p>
<p>Before we open a book, we should understand what a book is. A book is a tool that provides knowledge, and reading is a means to improve and enrich life. After choosing interesting books, we should devote all our energy to one book, and only after we fully understand it can we read a second book. In this way, after continuous comparison, experience, and observation, our knowledge will definitely increase greatly, but the foundation of success lies in "perseverance."</p>
<p>In ancient China, there were many maxims about "perseverance," such as "Reading is like a chick hatching an egg, you can't leave it for a moment," and "Reading is like sailing against the current, if you don't advance, you will retreat," which can give us some excitement and encouragement! "Save a penny a day, and you will save a thousand in three years." These two thrifty proverbs can be changed to "Read an article a day, and you will read a thousand in three years." These two "perseverance" maxims, children, imagine after you have read more than a thousand articles, your knowledge will also have considerable cultivation! Children, I wish you success!</p>
<h3>A Few Smart Children</h3>
<p>— Ping Dan</p>
<p>When Wang Yuanze was four or five years old, someone offered a sika deer and a deer in the same cage. That person asked Yuanze, "Which one is the sika deer? Which one is the deer?" Yuanze did not yet know what a sika deer or deer was, so he replied: "The one next to the sika deer is the deer, and the one next to the deer is the sika deer."</p>
<p>Xu Ruzi was playing in the moonlight, and someone pointed at the moon and said to him, "If there were no dark shadows in the moon, wouldn't it be brighter?" Ruzi said, "No, this is like the pupils in the eyes. Without pupils, there is no light." At that time, Xu Ruzi was only nine years old.</p>
<p>When Wang Rong was seven years old, he was playing with a group of children in the suburbs. They saw a plum tree by the roadside with many fruits. The children competed to pick them. Rong alone did not move and said, "This must be a bitter plum, because it is by the roadside and has many fruits." It was indeed bitter when they tried it.</p>
<p>Emperor Ming of Jin was a few years old, and Emperor Yuan held him on his lap and asked, "Is Chang'an far, or is the sun far?" He replied: "The sun is far. I have never heard of anyone coming from the sun, only people coming from Chang'an." The next day, Emperor Yuan held a banquet for his ministers and asked him the same question again. Emperor Ming replied: "The sun is near, Chang'an is far." Emperor Yuan was very surprised and asked him, "Why do you say the sun is near?" He replied: "You can see the sun when you look up, but you can't see Chang'an."</p>
<p>When Yue Zhu was eight years old, he saw that Tao Mu, who was cutting her hair to entertain guests in He Cheng's painting, was wearing gold bracelets, so he said: "Since Tao Mu has gold bracelets, she can easily exchange them for wine to entertain guests. Why cut her hair?"</p>
<p>When Wang Zhao was young, his family was poor, but he loved to read. He was without food for three days, but he still held a book without stopping. His family rebuked him and said, "You are so poor, why don't you go farming?" Zhao said: "That's right, I am farming every day!"</p>
<p>When Chen Yuanfang was seven years old, a good friend of his father went out together one day. Later, because the friend did not arrive on time, he went first. Unexpectedly, after he left, the friend came and asked Yuanfang, "Is your father at home?" He replied: "He left because you didn't arrive." The friend angrily scolded, "You are not human. You made an appointment to go, but you left first." Yuanfang said: "You didn't arrive at the agreed time, which is untrustworthy; scolding a father to his son is disrespectful." The friend was ashamed, got out of the car and wanted to apologize. Yuanfang refused and went inside.</p>
<p>When Xie Renzu was eight years old, one day, he participated in his father's many upper-class guests, looking like a prominent person. Someone praised him and said: "He is like Yan Hui, a young man in the audience." Renzu said: "No, there is no Zhongni in the audience, so where does Yan Hui come from?"</p>
<h3>Bleaching</h3>
<p>The weather was very good on Sunday. Min'er went out to play and saw many white things in the square over there. He took a closer look and found that there were many towels drying in the sun. He ran over, and there was also a big water tank there, filled with clear water. A worker stood by the tank, constantly putting the towels in the tank to wash, and they all smelled very bad. The worker washed these towels very white, and there was no more odor. Min'er was very curious when he saw this, so he asked the worker by the tank:</p>
<p>"Master, why do these towels smell so bad?"</p>
<p>"These towels have just been bleached in bleaching water, so they smell very bad." "What is called bleaching water?" Bleaching water is made by dissolving bleaching powder in water. It can bleach towels. How is this bleaching powder made? Bleaching water is made by placing slaked lime in a ash storage room. This ash storage room is made of lead plates or stone pieces, and its surroundings are airtight. There are several layers of wooden boards on the four walls of the room. The wooden boards are covered with slaked lime, about an inch or so of lime on a layer of wooden board. On the other side of the room is a lead pipe, which is connected to another room. The inside of the other room is manufacturing chlorine. The manufactured chlorine is passed from the lead pipe to the ash storage room, and the slaked lime absorbs chlorine. After one day and one night, the lime expands and becomes bleaching powder." "How can it bleach?" "I don't know." The worker smiled, shook his head, and ran away.</p>
<p>Min'er quickly went home and asked his brother, Cong'er: "Brother, how can bleaching powder bleach?"</p>
<p>"Colored cloth, soaked in bleaching water, gradually fades the color. However, this bleaching is done by the chlorine itself being able to bleach, which is done by chlorine, and not by chlorine and water decomposing and releasing nascent oxygen. To bleach with bleaching powder, you must add some dilute sulfuric acid, which decomposes and produces oxygen, which causes the bleaching effect. As for how to bleach? The bleaching procedure is to first soak the colored cloth in a solution of bleaching powder, then soak the cloth in dilute sulfuric acid, and then rinse it in clear water, and the cloth will be very white." Cong'er said this.</p>

<p>Scientific Little Question</p>
<h3>Is there a sun on cloudy days?</h3>
<p>— Zixi</p>
<p>Before saying whether there is a sun on cloudy days, we should first briefly talk about the structure of our eyes: the front of our eyeballs is a crystalline lens, and the back of our eyeballs is the retina. After the sun's light passes through the crystalline lens, the image of the sun also appears on the retina. When there is an image on the retina, the optic nerve behind the retina reports to the brain, and then we see the sun. If there is any obstruction between the sun and our eyes, the sun's light cannot penetrate into our eyeballs, and naturally no image of the sun will appear on our retina, and of course we cannot see the sun. On cloudy days, the air is filled with many very thick rain clouds, and the sunlight is blocked from shooting down by them (rain clouds), and naturally it cannot penetrate into our eyeballs, let alone appear on our retina, so we cannot see the sun on cloudy days. In fact, above the rain clouds, brilliant sunshine is still shining. As long as these rain clouds disperse, the sunlight will naturally still shine on the earth and penetrate into our eyeballs. From this, we can know that there is a sun on cloudy days, but we just can't see the sun on cloudy days. Children! Don't doubt it anymore: and don't go back to believing in any myths.</p>
<h3>Yan and Children</h3>
<p>— Hu Ren</p>
<p>The weather is getting warmer, and the swallows have also flown from the north. They build nests under people's eaves and lay eggs. They only fly back when the weather turns cold again.</p>
<p>Ming-er's house also has swallows building a nest under the eaves. Every day, he sees them flying back and forth. Ming-er is very curious and often wants to take a look, but he is not allowed to without his parents' permission. One day, taking advantage of his parents' absence, Ming-er secretly took a ladder and climbed up to take a look. There were three baby swallows in the nest, and the adult swallow was nowhere to be seen. The three baby swallows were very frightened when they saw Ming-er and all retreated into the nest. Ming-er thought, "If I catch them and keep them in a cage at home, how interesting would that be!" He reached out to grab them, but the baby swallows, seeing this, used their beaks to peck Ming-er's hand. Ming-er quickly said, "Little swallows! Don't be afraid, I will definitely not hurt you." The swallows said, "No, our mom and dad aren't home, we don't dare to go out, because they are looking for us." Ming-er said, "What's the point of them looking?" The swallow said, "Not only are they looking, but if they can't find us, they'll cry for us!" Ming-er said, "It doesn't matter, let them cry." The swallows said, "No, no, I'll ask you, if your mom and dad aren't home, and someone came to trick you into leaving, what would you think of your mom and dad?" "I would definitely cry!" "Okay! Then if we run away, our mom and dad will cry too!" "Hmm..." "Their parents love them, just like my mom and dad love me!" Ming-er firmly remembered this sentence in his heart.</p>
<h3>The Filming of Movies and Cartoons</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yi'an</p>
<p>An ordinary movie is made up of many consecutive images projected one after another. The things or facts filmed are both real and fake. When fake things appear, they can make you see them as if they were real, because the parts that would reveal the falsehood are not filmed. This is due to the position, distance, angle, and other factors of the camera lens. For example, a very large city wall might only appear to be a few feet in size, because it is filmed from a very close distance, making you think it's larger. The protagonist in a movie seems to be risking their life, but in reality, they are very safe during filming. From far away, you see someone jumping out of a window on the tenth floor, but that person is fake. The cameraman and director use various techniques to make us see all the things in the play as if they were real, making us feel thrilled and on the edge of our seats.</p>
<p>When we sit and watch Mickey Mouse and other bizarre cartoons, we naturally laugh heartily. At that time, we might think, "These characters don't actually exist. How are they filmed and made to perform all sorts of actions?" Explaining this is very simple. Cartoon movies are made by filming many individual drawings in succession, each one drawn by hand. Each drawing changes the shape of the action slightly, so when it is projected, you see the characters in the drawing moving.</p>
<p>If you know that a four-hundred-foot-long film requires more than six thousand shots, you might worry that it would take a painter several months to complete a cartoon. That's right, if every picture had to be drawn from scratch, it would indeed take a very long time. But they have their clever methods. For example, if the scene shows a policeman standing and waving his arm, only his arm is moving. Then, all that's needed is to draw a policeman without an arm, and then draw many arms in sequential motion on some transparent material. Then, these arms in different positions are stacked in order on the policeman's drawing and filmed one by one. Even with this labor-saving method of drawing, a cartoon still requires a great deal of effort. If the movements in the picture involve more than one arm, the entire body is in motion, or a second character is added, then each frame has to be redrawn completely.</p>
<p>Another thing we need to know is that the drawing of a cartoon is not the work of one person. Often, one hundred or so people are assigned to different tasks. However, there are always one or two people who plan it in advance, and one or two main artists who first sketch out the required movements and expressions, and then many artists share the task of drawing.</p>

<h3>Ten Minutes of Science Teaching</h3>
<p>— Bai Tao</p>
<p>The Science of Life</p>
<p>We have already talked about light, talked about water, talked about silver and gold, copper and iron; we know that these things all follow certain rules; just like a machine, turning according to certain rules. Then, do living things also follow certain rules? Perhaps you will say that all living things do not follow certain rules. Are they outside the laws of science? Is that really the case? If you think about it again, you will know that living things also follow certain rules. Let's not talk about anything else, let's just talk about plants. Isn't every plant sprouted from a seed? Farmers sow rice seeds, and then seedlings grow; sow soybean seeds, and then beans grow. Those who grow flowers also have to sow flower seeds before beautiful flowers can grow. Nothing does not grow from seeds.</p>
<p>Even animals, a worm, a tiny bug, all have seeds. In the summer, maggots will grow on decaying meat. Those small bugs will suddenly crawl around on the meat. An ignorant person might think that maggots will automatically grow on meat. Are those maggots created from nothing? No, definitely not. Everyone knows flies. Flies lay eggs in latrines, and only then will maggots grow. Maggots will grow on meat only if a flesh fly lays eggs on the meat. Only after the eggs hatch into maggots will maggots appear. In the summer, fly eggs hatch very quickly. These maggots grow up, go through several transformations, and then become a fly and fly away.</p>
<p>There are also some insects that can lay their eggs on other living insects. There is a type of wild wasp called an ichneumon wasp, which you can easily see in the summer and autumn. It will lay its eggs on caterpillars. When it spots a fat caterpillar, it immediately flies up and rides on the caterpillar's body. The caterpillar twists and turns in panic. However, the ichneumon wasp has quickly raised the stinger on its tail and stabs down; no, that is not a stinger, but its ovipositor. It quickly lays its eggs on the caterpillar's belly and flies away. The caterpillar does not feel anything. It continues to eat leaves and live. However, soon the ichneumon wasp's eggs hatch, producing many grub-like larvae. These larvae eat the caterpillar's flesh and blood, until only an empty shell remains. At this time, the larvae have also grown up. Soon, you will see that the empty shell is covered with a silk bag, like a cocoon. This cocoon is spun by the larvae. After a while, the cocoon breaks, and an ichneumon wasp crawls out. People who don't know think that caterpillars will turn into cocoons and create ichneumon wasps from nothing!</p>
<p>An ichneumon wasp rides on a caterpillar, raising its ovipositor high and laying its eggs on the caterpillar's body.</p>
<p>We can also find many, many interesting examples. Even those bacteria that make people sick have seeds. When they get a chance to invade our blood vessels, it's like people have acquired a large colony, quickly multiplying. But we humans fall ill. The only way is to stay clean and not let them in; the second is to exercise and strengthen the body so that bacteria cannot become active in the body.</p>
<p>We have talked long enough, we know that all living things also follow the laws of science. If you examine them carefully, you can know even more.</p>
<p>Children's Creations</p>
<h3>A Pitiful Girl</h3>
<p>— Cao Meiying, Third Grade, Wan Zhu Elementary School</p>
<p>Outside our school, at the foot of the south wall, stands a little girl about eight or nine years old. Her face is dark, her body is very dirty, and she is terribly thin. She often begs for money from passers-by. "One day, I was walking home from school and passed by her. She cried and said to me, 'Miss! Thank you, give me a copper coin, pity me, I haven't eaten all day today.'" At that time, I listened to her words and saw her crying even more pitifully. I reached into my pocket and found only five copper coins left over from buying books, and a sesame cake that I had not finished eating. I gave them all to her. She took the copper coins and ate the sesame cake. After only a few bites, she finished it and said, "Miss! Thank you!" I was curious and asked her, "Why don't you, a little girl like you, go to school to study, but come out to beg from passers-by?" She replied, "Miss! I am truly pitiful. When I was three years old, my family lived in Zhabei. My father ran a small cigarette and paper shop, and business was still good. Later, there was a war, and my father was killed by the enemy. In less than three months, my mother became ill and died. I don't have any relatives, so I have no choice but to live this life of begging." I heard her words and felt very sad, so I didn't want to listen anymore. On the way home, I walked and thought, there is no one in the world more pitiful than someone without parents. I have a father and a mother who send me to school. Today, after hearing this girl's words, I should study hard and encourage all the children in the world who have fathers and mothers to study hard and strive for progress.</p>
<h3>The Tale of the Righteous Dog (20)</h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>Whenever Poddershi came to the door of an acquaintance, he would still stop as usual, look up at the person and silently make a pleading expression, but the person would heartlessly close the door, letting Poddershi drag the empty cart away in disappointment. They did this for no other reason than to win the favor of Kogan Shi.</p>
<p>The weather was extremely cold, and the snow on the ground was six feet deep. The ice was very solid, so even if many people and cattle walked on it, it would not break through. During this cold winter season, the village was often very happy. Even the poorest families prepared cakes and milk wine, sugar-made icons, and gilded Jesus Christ. Everyone laughed and danced, and the sound of bells on horses jingled everywhere. In every house, there was always a pot full of broth boiling on the stove. Those girls wearing beautiful scarves and brand-new coats smiled and walked back and forth in the snow, going to attend mass. But in that small house, it was very dark and very cold.</p>
<p>It turned out that one night a week before Christmas, death stepped into the door of this small house and took old Dass away, leaving only little Nanluo and Poddershi to live through the days pitifully. Old Dass had suffered from poverty all his life, and had been lifeless, suffering from paralysis, unable to move, and already seemed half-dead. But now that he was truly dead, it was a big blow to little Nanluo and Poddershi, and they were very sad. He suddenly died quietly in his sleep, and they only realized it the next morning, suddenly feeling an atmosphere of sorrow and loneliness surrounding them. Although old Dass was a paralyzed and useless old man, unable to even lift a hand to protect them, they had always loved him very much. Every day when they came back, they always saw him welcoming them with a smile. They wailed and cried, unwilling to stop. On a snowy winter day, they followed a thin coffin to an unnamed graveyard next to a small chapel. Only the two of them were at the funeral, and they had no other relatives in this world.</p>

<p>Economic Exchange</p>
<h3>Recent Conditions of American Railway Economics</h3>
<p>— Sun Yizhi</p>
<p>Under Roosevelt's so-called New Deal, the American economy has indeed shown improvements in many areas in the past two years. But this improvement, as many economic researchers have pointed out, is artificial and abnormally uncoordinated. This situation can be seen in the excessive development of the American aircraft manufacturing industry, shipbuilding industry, automobile industry, and other military-related industries; at the same time, in the railway industry and some major industries, even such prosperity is very weak, or even such prosperity cannot be talked about. Now, let's take a concrete look at the recent situation of the American railway industry.</p>
<p>According to a survey by the American Railway Economics Bureau, the total operating revenue of the leading American railway companies last year was 3.44 billion US dollars, which is not only a significant increase compared to 1931, but also a 5.15% increase compared to the previous year's total revenue. Judging from this situation alone, people can of course say without thinking that this is also a manifestation of the improvement in the American economy. However, we must first note that in the past year, American railway operating expenses also increased at the same time, increasing by 5.45% compared to the previous year, totaling 2.575 billion US dollars. Therefore, in the end, the net income last year did not increase much compared to the previous year. In fact, the investment rate of return on property investment in the United States last year was 1.90%, which did not show a great increase compared to 1.80% in the previous year.</p>
<p>If we look at the overall situation of American railway revenue and its investment rate of return in the past ten years or so, then it can be said that American railway operations have not only not truly improved, but can be said to still be in a recession. Please see the following table.</p>
<p>Income Table of Leading American Railway Companies</p>
<p>Total Revenue (Millions of US Dollars) Investment Rate of Return %</p>
<p>1923 6,360 4.33</p>
<p>1924 5,988 4.21</p>
<p>1925 6,187 4.74</p>
<p>1926 6,465 4.98</p>
<p>1927 6,210 4.30</p>
<p>1928 6,190 4.65</p>
<p>1929 6, 中60 4.84</p>
<p>1930 5,343 3.30</p>
<p>1931 4,236 2.00</p>
<p>1932 3,162 1.25</p>
<p>1933 3,092 1.83</p>
<p>1934 3,271 1.80</p>
<p>1935 3,440 1.90</p>
<p>From this statistical figure, we can clearly know that the income of American railways in the past two years is not only far less than the number before the panic of 1929, but even after the implementation of Roosevelt's so-called New Deal, this income has not seen a significant increase compared to before.</p>
<p>Regarding the situation of railway transportation of goods, we can also see on the one hand that the volume of goods transported by American railways has indeed increased significantly in recent years. For example, as of December 28th last year, the number of freight cars transporting goods in 52 weeks was 31,518,000, an increase of 2.18% compared to the same period last year; and an increase of 2.85% compared to the same period in 1932. But on the other hand, due to competition from the same industry, railway freight rates have decreased. Therefore, although the volume of goods transported has increased, railway operating revenue has not increased proportionally, and it is still difficult to restore the income level before the panic.</p>
<p>At the same time, although American entrepreneurs and economists surrounding Roosevelt are singing the song of prosperity and dreaming of recovery, the majority of the American people are still becoming increasingly impoverished. Therefore, in recent years, the passenger traffic of American railways has not been crowded. Although the railway companies are working hard to improve train facilities and reduce fares in order to attract passengers, the result is that in addition to increasing competition costs, they have not gained much. According to statistics, the proportion of passenger fare revenue to freight revenue for leading American railway companies was 29.8% in 1920, but decreased to 18.1% in 1929, and further decreased to 13.2% in 1934, and there has been no improvement to this day. This fact has fully demonstrated that the majority of the American people are becoming increasingly impoverished, and at the same time, it also shows that under the current situation, American railway operations have no hope of restoring their old appearance and developing.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth pondering that in the recent freight of American railways, the production of rural products has decreased significantly. The statistics for this in the past year are as follows:</p>
<p>Type of Goods Number of Freight Cars Comparison with Previous Year (%)</p>
<p>(Unit: Thousand Cars)</p>
<p>Grains 1,577 (Down) 4.2</p>
<p>Livestock 715 (Down) 33.5</p>
<p>Coal 6,147 (Up) 0.2</p>
<p>Coke 346 (Up) 3.9</p>
<p>Forest Products 1,383 (Up) 20.4</p>
<p>Minerals 993 (Up) 25.2</p>
<p>General Merchandise 8,122 (Up) 1.4</p>
<p>Other 12,235 (Up) 6.6</p>
<p>Total 31,518 (Up) 2.2</p>
<p>In these statistics, it is clearly shown that the output of American agricultural products, especially livestock, from rural areas is decreasing. This undoubtedly shows that the American agricultural panic is deepening under Roosevelt's so-called New Deal. At the same time, because of the depression in agriculture and the special reduction in the transportation of agricultural products by railways, railway operations will of course be greatly affected. This situation is particularly evident in the fact that the railway operations in the agricultural areas of the western United States have been very sluggish recently.</p>
<p>Due to the above-mentioned difficulties, the operations of many American railway companies have had to fall into increasingly difficult circumstances. The most serious problem facing American railways today is that many small railway companies are on the verge of bankruptcy. Even in 1935, the so-called year of business recovery, the bankruptcy of small American railway companies continued to occur;</p>
<h3>Introduction to "Healthy World" Issue 7</h3>
<p>— Like</p>
<p>Truly a "Terrible Imps"! It's only five minutes before the publication deadline for this magazine, and I haven't written a single word for this introduction. The editor has urged me several times already. I'd feel bad handing in a blank page, so I'll just cobble together a few sentences in a last-minute scramble.</p>
<p>Five minutes! My brain is filled with "five minutes": — "Five-minute exercise," "five-minute fame," "five-minute novels," "five minutes"...</p>
<p>Okay! One minute has passed quickly!</p>
<p>Time is flying faster and faster, and writing becomes more and more difficult. Grandpa! What should I write? But I thought of one thing, which is: there are people who can do "five-minute exercises" in the morning, but very few can do it every day without interruption. They only have "five-minute fame."</p>
<p>Goodness gracious! Another minute has passed!</p>
<p>Never mind! I have to keep writing! Luckily, God saved me and made me think of another thing, which is: people who do "five-minute exercises" may not necessarily be able to write "five-minute novels." Brave people have never automatically been wise people.</p>
<p>Now, let me offer readers a little advice: if you want to be able to do "five-minute exercises" and at the same time maintain "fame" for more than "five minutes," and also write "five-minute novels," then it's best to subscribe to "Healthy World," because the content of this publication not only focuses on personal physical health but also emphasizes personal mental development, literary cultivation, and soundness of thought. This is the difference between this publication and general health publications. And... and...</p>
<p>But time is always against me. Just as I was writing enthusiastically, with a stream of ideas coming to me, another minute has passed! Now, there are only two minutes left. I don't feel like writing anymore, so I'll just copy a small news item about the publication from the newspaper as a conclusion:</p>
<p>The seventh issue of the monthly magazine "Healthy World," full of vitality, was published on the 16th. The content is rich, with more than twenty articles, the most outstanding of which are: Mr. Kangjian Zhaifu's "Returning to Primitive Healthy Living," Mr. Zhu Hansong's "Health and Life," Mr. Zhang Jianqing's "A Casual Discussion of Dietary Hygiene," Mr. Jia Feng's "Physiological Changes in Women After Marriage," Mr. Wu Xinfa's "Improvement of 'Lysol' Production Method," etc. The "Healthy Pictorial" section features many dynamic photos of beautiful and healthy women. The original excellent sections are still maintained. Each issue retails for six cents, including postage. The annual subscription for twelve issues, including postage, is only 50 cents in national currency in China and one dollar abroad. The publication is sold at lifestyle bookstores, major newspaper stands, and major book and magazine companies everywhere. It is said that there are still copies of the previous six issues available for purchase. Those who wish to obtain them can attach 40 cents and send it directly to the general distributor of "Healthy World" at No. 14, Lane 214, Tongfu Road, Shanghai, and they will be sent immediately.</p>

<p>Last year alone, eighty-nine railway companies were placed under court-appointed management, with operating routes reaching 72,000 miles. This is indeed the latest and highest record in American railway history!</p>
<p>The continued bankruptcy of these small railway companies, on the one hand, clearly demonstrates that the American railway business has not yet escaped the disaster of economic recession. At the same time, on the other hand, it also shows the fierce competition between large and small capitalists in the American railway industry. The bankruptcy of small railway companies can be seen as a phenomenon of large capital swallowing small capital, and also as a further development of American monopoly capital.</p>
<p>In the past, governments of various countries nominally prohibited monopolies, but as capital became more concentrated and the global crisis developed, many countries had to openly support the development of monopolies. Roosevelt's "New Deal" in the United States, in addition to explicitly abolishing anti-trust laws, also used government funds to help the development of monopolies under the guise of public works. Of course, it also made every effort to help railway monopolists. For example, in 193_4_, the American government, for the purpose of railway reconstruction, allocated $200,000,000 to railway monopolists under the guise of public works, and provided preferential credit loan terms, extending the loan term from fifteen to thirty years at four percent interest, with no interest charged in the first year. In this way, the American railway industry naturally showed some improvement on the one hand, but on the other hand, it also contributed to the faster bankruptcy of many small railway companies, pushing the situation of railway monopoly towards an extreme direction.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the "Gold Dollar Empire" is the richest country in the world today, but in fact, the wealth of the United States is now controlled by sixty-four people. Among them, those who control railway capital and monopolize the railway business are of course even fewer. Roosevelt's New Deal is currently working hard to help the development of these few people. Therefore, if the American railway industry shows a good situation, it is only the good situation of a few monopolists on the one hand, while many small railway companies are going bankrupt and many American people are becoming increasingly impoverished. As a result of this development, due to the increasing reduction of general purchasing power, even those so-called first-class railway businesses will become more and more depressed; therefore, even with government assistance, railway monopolists may not be able to avoid the difficult situation of being unable to maintain themselves. In fact, as mentioned above, the current situation of the entire American railway industry is indeed not optimistic.</p>

<h3>Paris in May</h3>
<p>— Yuanqing</p>
<p>Paris has always been known as the "City of Flowers." It has the world's largest opera house, all kinds of dance halls, beautiful natural scenery, and many famous historical sites that can be boasted about throughout Europe; as long as you have money, you can indeed enjoy all the pleasures of life here.</p>
<p>In early summer, in May, everything in nature has long been revived. The small parks in Paris, the trees along the streets, and the forests and grasslands in the suburbs are all a fresh green. If Moscow in May is a red world, then Paris in May can be said to be a green park.</p>
<p>The Palace of Versailles is one of the many famous historical sites in Paris that everyone knows. The architecture and scenery of this palace are rarely seen; in May, because all the trees and flowers are reviving and flourishing, it is naturally even more beautiful. At the same time, the famous Versailles fountains used to be viewable every Monday from May to October, but now they can only be seen in early summer in May: this naturally further enhances the scenery of Paris in May.</p>
<p>The Versailles Garden was built by the famous gardener of the time, Ru, Lotel. Its characteristic is that all the solemn palaces, natural terrain, and every tree and stone are balanced and harmonious; it can be said to be a representative of the garden art of the Louis XIV era.</p>
<p>In addition, the fact that the sun sets directly in the middle of the Arc de Triomphe on May 5th is also quite interesting. According to the popular explanation here, May 5th happens to be the day Napoleon died, and the sun setting directly from the center of the Arc de Triomphe on this day is a representation of Napoleon's death. This is of course a superstitious hero-worship explanation. However, probably due to the Earth's rotation, every year in May, although it is not necessarily the 5th, there will always be one day when the sun does set directly in the middle of the Arc de Triomphe. In this way, artificial buildings and natural scenery are integrated; this integrated beautiful scenery can only be seen in Paris in May.</p>

<p>Industrial and Commercial Practice</p>
<h3>Shop Investigation Work</h3>
<p>— Heqing</p>
<p>Everyone, of course, pays attention to issues related to their work at all times; this goes without saying. As for business people in general, they are even more constantly paying attention to the situation in the financial world, the price of goods, the dynamics of buyers, and everything in the industrial and commercial world; it seems that there is even less need for others to worry about this. However, the investigation and concern of general stores and product manufacturers regarding matters related to them is often arbitrary and anarchic. For example, some capable business people do often go to the stock exchange, read industrial and commercial news and even advertisements, and inquire about all industrial and commercial news, so they are very clear about everything related to their business; but because his actions are individual and unplanned, and not organized and scientific actions of his business, the resulting benefits are less. We know that the current era is a scientific era, and also an era of the most intense industrial and commercial competition. People entering and exiting the business world must operate their business in the most scientific way in order to have a chance of victory; in this, even very small things should be carried out with precise planning; general investigation work, which is related to the determination and implementation of the direction of business competition, should be given special attention and should not be done rashly.</p>
<p>Large department stores in Europe, America, and Japan have established an investigation department in their scientific and rational organization, specializing in investigating various industrial and commercial situations in order to constantly determine new business directions. At the same time, even small and medium-sized stores with only five or six employees specially train their employees in investigation knowledge and regularly and systematically send employees to do investigation work in rotation to increase business efficiency.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the investigation work of shops must mainly pay attention to these points:</p>
<p>First, constantly investigate extraordinary events of general citizens, such as weddings, birthdays, childbirth, building houses, illness, death, group gatherings, etc.; because these things are very closely related to the business of many shops: if a shop discovers that a certain citizen has the above-mentioned extraordinary event, and this event is deeply related to its business, then it can quickly decide to use various methods to do this business. Conversely, if the store does not pay attention to investigation work at ordinary times, then this business is unlikely to come to the door by itself.</p>
<p>Second, investigate the shop organizations, capital quantities, and operating methods of various similar businesses, in order to emulate the strengths of others, remove their own shortcomings, and fundamentally determine their own competition direction.</p>
<p>Third, investigate the quantity and quality of all the goods that they operate in the city and their flow situation, investigate the commercial affairs related to them in other places and the consumption capacity of their own goods in this city, in order to determine a fundamental business plan.</p>
<p>Fourth, always pay attention to the domestic and foreign political and economic trends.</p>
<p>In this way, after having actual materials for each investigation work, the shop owner should very democratically convene all shop staff and clerks (or a small number of important clerks) to discuss and jointly decide on countermeasures. Proceeding in this way day by day, the store will surely develop day by day in continuous innovation and continuous acquisition of new customers.</p>
<p>Currently, some stores in China are also paying attention to investigation work, such as specially set up promoters and street runners, who can be said to be bearing part of the investigation task. But generally speaking, it is still not scientific. We should emulate others, meticulously divide out the things to be investigated, systematically train and send out investigators, and if necessary, also create investigation forms to fill in the various actual materials obtained. Carrying out investigation work scientifically in this way is of great importance to the development of business.</p>

<h3>How to Be a Bookstore Clerk?</h3>
<p>— Jichang</p>
<p>In the past, the so-called "book merchants" used their lifelong experience to associate with books every day. Therefore, their knowledge was often more complex and broader than that of some scholars. They knew the editions of ancient books, whether they were Song editions or Ming editions; they knew which books were "rare books," "unique books," or "secret books." Therefore, they knew the value of ancient books, the contents of ancient books, and the goodness of their collations and the completeness or lack of their chapters, all clearly. Also, they were quite versed in the study of "catalogs," knowing that certain books should belong to certain categories, on the one hand, to facilitate the selection and retrieval of purchasers, and on the other hand, to collect and search on behalf of purchasers at the invitation of purchasers. Therefore, although the matter of "book merchants" is a superficial occupation, if you really want to do it well, it is not an easy task.</p>
<p>Now, Western learning is spreading to the East, and science is rising. Not only do you, as a bookstore business person, need to know the general outline of ancient books such as the classics, history, philosophy, and collections; but you also need to be fully familiar with the newly published magazines and newspapers. So, to serve in a bookstore, truly speaking, the difficulty may be even greater than before. Therefore, those who want to engage in the operation of the book industry, whether you are the general manager of a bookstore, in charge of "publishing," doing "business department" or "distribution department" work, or even a clerk, you must understand a general idea of the general knowledge that you must know.</p>
<p>As for the managers and directors, we don't need to talk about them here. Because they at least have general knowledge, considerable experience, and can understand the general needs of the book market in order to determine the direction of their supply, and can determine the nature of their books according to the shift in the times, either solely for the purpose of profit, or occasionally taking "cultural tasks" as their responsibility. In short, they probably all have "purposeful consciousness," and we don't need to tell them anything. Our target is the general bookstore clerk. Naturally, depending on the size of the bookstore, there are many kinds of clerks, such as "street runners" and "counter sitters," some who have risen from "apprentices" to clerks, and some who have risen from clerks to "teachers." In short, we are targeting personnel who do technical work.</p>
<p>For the sake of easy explanation and to speak in an organized manner, we may as well assume a kind of bookstore as the object of explanation. The specimen we take is not a large bookstore like "Commercial Press" or "Chunghwa," which is well-organized and has a detailed division of labor, but rather those small and medium-sized bookstores. Because, if we want to be an "employee" of a large bookstore, our level must pass an exam, and after being admitted, there will be a period of training, education, and guidance on the knowledge that should be possessed for that profession. But the clerks of small and medium-sized bookstores have to rely entirely on their own learning. Moreover, the affairs of large bookstores, because of the division of labor, are very simple and easy to master; but in small and medium-sized bookstores, one person may hold several positions, and some may gradually rise from preliminary work to advanced work, so the changes are very large and the content of the work is very complex, and we cannot but indicate them one by one here.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, it seems that ordinary people who are literate and know a little about books can be bookstore clerks. However, no matter how simple the business operated by the bookstore is, such as only handling distribution without setting up a retail department, or only selling exclusively without wholesaling or selling on consignment; however; a bookstore, if it wants to develop its business, you will never succeed if you close yourself off. You must go through many relationships and fulfill some obligations that may not be rewarded immediately. Such as finding book lists for readers, answering readers' questions about publishing news, and accepting readers' entrustments without compensation to order books and newspapers for them. Because through these works, you can give a good impression to some customers who have "dealings" with you, and they can be your permanent customers. And they can "pull relationships" and "introduce business" for you. What a bookstore fears most is that no readers ask about it, because the relationship between bookstores and bookstores is still an indirect way of finding "sales routes," while the relationship between bookstores and readers is a direct way of "sales routes." This is an opportunity that cannot be missed. A bookstore cannot be isolated. Also, you must find "consignment outlets" in many ways. Because the target of your head office is too small, and the scope you can reach is too close, even if you have branches, you always need a small consignment outlet in remote areas, not to mention that you cannot control or take care of some big cities with just one branch, so you need to borrow other people's relationships and credibility to do your business, just as you purchase other people's books on consignment based on your relationship and credibility. Therefore, the most important thing in the bookstore business is to seek close and fast connections between bookstores and readers, and to try to promote its development and improvement as much as possible. The second is to have a practical connection and mutual assistance between bookstores and bookstores, that is, between fellow businesses.</p>
<p>Because of the expansion of business, the knowledge of bookstore employees must be correspondingly enriched. First, take the store itself as an example. If a reader, simply after looking at your bookstore's catalog or the advertisement published in the newspaper, feels that he does not know enough about the content of a certain book you publish and needs to understand it further, he writes to inquire, you should of course answer him as much as possible. But if you yourself do not have a general understanding of certain books, that is to say, who wrote it, what department it is a book from, what chapters it has, if you don't know these, how can you answer others? Just about the books published by your own bookstore, it is not an easy thing to know their contents in general, let alone to recommend them to others? Of course, we cannot say that you must fully possess the knowledge of selecting and purchasing books, but you must know the common sense of general bibliography, and you must always pay attention to and collect the catalog booklets entered by various peers and the new book previews and advertisements published in various newspapers, so that you can satisfy the expectations of readers or consignment outlets in other places. When you publish a new book yourself, you should usually record the addresses of your regular readers or the "subscribers" to your store's magazine, and send them the new book catalog or a single-page advertisement. When a new book is published, you should immediately donate a copy to some public institutions, especially the libraries of various universities. This is a very effective advertisement. In short, you must seize every opportunity to do your job.</p>
<p>From the "bookkeeping" ledger, you can see which types of books generally sell well, and which books sell well in certain places. Based on this, you can not only specify the quantity of your own "adding books," but also report this situation to the editorial department, and can also modify and specify the publishing policy. There is no harm in adding more of the books that sell well, and adding less of the books that do not sell well, and adding other books instead. To see how much capacity certain markets have, to see what the level of readers under the jurisdiction of certain markets is, in order to determine the quantity of wholesale of newly published books. Otherwise, either the supply will fall short of demand, or the books will be "stuck in stock for a long time," which is a loss.</p>
<p>Also, now the method of mail order is very popular. If you register the catalog with the post office at any time in some remote places without branches and consignment outlets, and you have a contract with the post office, then your books can penetrate into all places. The post office can also collect money on your behalf, and naturally it will charge a handling fee, but very little. Transporting books is also a very troublesome thing. If the "packing" is not good or the person entrusted is not reliable, the loss of books is very large. In addition, attention should be paid to speed. If there are time-sensitive books and newspapers, and the transportation is time-consuming and the journey is long, the loss is also not small. Generally, most books are shipped by post office, and some are shipped by transportation company. In short, it depends on the waterway and dry road, and it depends on the safety and "transportation" to determine.</p>
<p>The above is general knowledge. As for adapting to special circumstances, there are still many twists and turns and cunning tricks. Although it is not possible to treat people with it, you do need to understand a little bit in order to avoid being "fooled." In the current sluggish market, the so-called "commissions" and "discounts" are making a mess. First, the wholesale of various consignment outlets gives you discounts, wholesaling at 65% or 75% off. But "cash wholesale" is very rare, and consignment outlets with security deposits are also very rare. In remote areas where business is not much, not only can the "settlement" not be done on time, but there are also tricks such as "bankruptcy," "business suspension," and "arrears," but you cannot send someone to inquire. After the discount, at the end of each year, you also get a "95%" or "85%" commission. Or, in fact, it has already been "sold out," but you are told that there is still a lot of "inventory," how can you know? These unexpected events and cunning tricks in the business world require you to be "cautious" and to measure the situation in order to avoid them considerably. You must not be credulous and impetuous. But you must not be too rigid because of this, and you must still have the spirit of adventure in prudence. Naturally, this is with the goal of "small losses" and seeking new markets.</p>
<p>In short, to be a capable bookstore employee, in addition to understanding the above knowledge, you need to concentrate on training to be competent and successful. This is by no means an easy thing.</p>
<p>Brief News</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Chinese Women's Production Cooperative</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the retail department of the Chinese Women's Production Cooperative (including the food, calligraphy and painting, and handicraft departments) at No. 205 Yuanmingyuan Road in this city, the business has been quite developed. In two weeks, it has added four or five cooperative members, such as Mrs. Mao Kelun. The previous organization was investigated by personnel dispatched by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. Except for a few points in the articles of association that have been corrected, everything else is considered satisfactory. At the same time, the media has also unanimously praised it. Publications such as Shen Bao's Amateur Weekly, News Daily's New Garden, Shih Shih Hsin Pao's Supplement, and Women's Monthly have successively published long articles with detailed introductions. However, it was recently discovered that the "Guangdong Daily" published that the cooperative's "customers are wealthy young men and women, and the ladies are busy," "this is my intention as a drunkard," and that the book department has "History of Sex" sections, which has aroused the attention of people from all walks of life, who have been inquiring about the cooperative in recent days. According to the cooperative's members, the sections published in the newspaper are completely inconsistent with the facts, and such "benevolent views of wisdom" are not worth caring about. The books sold by the cooperative are purely published by major bookstores. In addition to literary works and various treatises on women's issues and family issues, there are also many books on women's education. As for magazines, there are "Women's Life," "Eternal Life Weekly," "Women's Monthly," "Heaven and Earth," "Chinese Comics," "Shanghai Comics," "Ten Days Magazine" and other publications, but there is no book called "History of Sex." The customers are also not limited to wealthy young men and women. It is also heard that the sales of the calligraphy and painting department of the cooperative are best for magazines. In the past two weeks, more than 2,000 copies of various magazines have been sold. Any bookstore or magazine publisher who wants to entrust the cooperative to sell or subscribe to magazines on behalf of customers can contact the cooperative.</p>

<h3>Daming Lake</h3>
<p>— Hometown</p>
<p>In the natural environment of the North, Jinan is a very unique place. Its vicinity not only has many beautiful mountains, but also bright and beautiful waters everywhere. To the north of Jinan, about five or six li away, is the famous Yellow River, crossing from west to east. Near the city walls is the Xiaoqing River, which serves as the main waterway for transportation between Jinan and its northeastern counties. But the most captivating aspect of the scenery is Daming Lake.</p>
<p>Daming Lake is located in the northern part of Jinan City, occupying half of the city's area. Although in recent years, many admirers of elegance have gradually filled in parts of the lake to build houses, causing its area to inevitably shrink, this has not only not affected the beauty of Daming Lake, but has instead enhanced its charm with the embellishment of red pavilions and embroidered chambers.</p>
<p>The majority of the lake is divided into countless square lake fields by small dikes.</p>
<p>Continued on page 5</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>The lake fields are entirely planted with lotus flowers. The surrounding small dikes are overgrown with reeds, and occasionally a few willows and peach trees stand tall and sway in between. In addition, there are the waterways for tourist boats, crisscrossing and fascinating. In the summer, when the lotus and reeds have grown fully, these waterways become mysterious little harbors. Sitting on a small boat and sailing into them, one can only see the red lotus, green reeds, and duckweed floating on the water, forgetting the hustle and bustle of the city.</p>
<p>In the middle of the lake and around its perimeter, there are many buildings and not-so-ancient scenic spots. In the center of the lake is the famous Lixia Pavilion. On its four shores are Zhang Gong Ancestral Hall, Huiquan Temple, Li Gong Ancestral Hall, the Library, Tie Gong Ancestral Hall, and Beiji Pavilion, among others. At these famous scenic spots, there are teahouses, snack stalls, and other facilities for tourists to rest and relax after their visits.</p>
<p>Lixia Pavilion stands alone in the center of the lake, completely surrounded by water, with no land access. Therefore, it is often called the "Isolated Pavilion." Although the area is not large, the architecture is quite complex. In addition to the central Lixia Pavilion, there are also buildings such as pavilions and corridors around it. In the center of the pavilion is an imperial stele written by Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty, and one can enjoy tea in the high buildings in front and behind. In the summer, one can not only enjoy the scenery of the entire lake and the surroundings of Jinan, but it is also a great place to cool off. Lixia Pavilion is the best and most ancient in terms of both scenery and history, as can be seen from the famous couplet hanging at its entrance: "This pavilion east of the sea is ancient, Jinan has many famous scholars."</p>
<p>On the east bank of the lake are Huiquan Temple and Zhang Gong Ancestral Hall. Huiquan Temple is an ordinary temple. In the past, it had a large scale of construction because it was a popular place of worship, so there were many visitors, but it is not what it once was. Zhang Gong Ancestral Hall is east of Huiquan Temple, bordered by water on two sides, and can also be reached by land. Among the various buildings in Daming Lake, this is the most magnificent. Zhang Gong Ancestral Hall is the ancestral hall of Zhang Yao of the Qing Dynasty. He served as the governor of Shandong. Later, he failed to supervise the Yellow River project, and the Yellow River overflowed, causing a major flood. He had no choice but to throw himself into the Yellow River and died. Local people built this ancestral hall in his honor. The ancestral hall is very large, with pavilions inside, and lotus ponds, rockeries, pavilions, and terraces in the courtyard. One can cool off and fish on the two sides facing the lake, making it a great place for leisure.</p>
<p>Beiji Pavilion is north of Zhang Gong Ancestral Hall. It is built on top of the city wall. The interior is also an ordinary temple, but it is managed by Taoist priests. Because this pavilion is a multi-story building built on the city wall, it is the highest point. Standing on top of it, one can see the entire Daming Lake and Thousand Buddha Mountain, ten li away from Jinan, to the south; the Que and Hua Mountains facing each other to the east and west are also clearly visible. To the north, one can overlook the Yellow River, which looks like a long yellow belt, and the lake fields outside the city.</p>
<p>According to Jinan residents' legends, Beiji Pavilion plays a very important role in Jinan's feng shui. Because Jinan has a lot of water, people generally regard the city as a precious boat. The Beiji Pavilion suppresses this boat, preventing it from drifting away with the flood when the water overflows. Although this is an absurd saying of the "rustic people of Qi," in the closed old era, spending such huge projects certainly had its superstitious significance.</p>
<p>Tie Gong Ancestral Hall is on the northwest bank of Daming Lake. If going by land, one must take a very long detour because it is located in the far northwest corner of the city. This ancestral hall is also relatively ancient. It was built to commemorate Tie Xuan, who firmly defended Jinan City in the early Ming Dynasty. When Emperor Chengzu of Ming Dynasty had full wings in Yanjing, he raised an army to march south to seize the throne of his nephew. When he arrived in Jinan, he encountered the formidable enemy, Tie Xuan. After besieging the city for several months, it still yielded no results, so he had no choice but to divert the Yellow River to flood the city before finally capturing Jinan. Tie Xuan died with the city. The scale of this ancestral hall is also very large, and because it was renovated not long ago, it is more brand new than any building around Daming Lake. The ancestral hall is surrounded by new-style iron railings, and the courtyard is full of various flower gardens, with several ancient willow trees swaying in the wind, giving it a unique charm. There is a statue of Tie Xuan in the main hall, and there are many ancient steles in the two corridors, causing many tourists to stop and pay their respects. Because this place is far from the center of the lake, its scenery is distinguished by its tranquility.</p>
<p>Opposite Tie Gong Ancestral Hall is Li Gong Ancestral Hall. This ancestral hall was built for Li Hongzhang of the late Qing Dynasty. The construction of the ancestral hall is slightly smaller than that of Zhang Gong Ancestral Hall, and there is nothing special about its internal layout.</p>
<p>On the west bank of Daming Lake is the Shandong Provincial Library. Although the scale of this library is not very large, the various departments it includes are very complex.</p>
<p>Not far from the entrance is a large reading room. There are more Chinese books and magazines inside. Next to the reading room, there are many antiques on display. Most of these antiques were unearthed in Shandong. Among them, the main ones are bronzes, pottery, and jades from the Zhou and Qin Dynasties. Further inside, after passing a small bridge and a section of the corridor, one enters another courtyard. In this courtyard, the south side is a high-rise building, and the north side is three large halls. The high-rise building on the south side displays various specimens, both living specimens and various animal specimens. The hall on the north side is also a specimen exhibition hall, but most of them are about agricultural products and minerals. In addition, there are some animals such as monkeys and gray cranes scattered throughout the courtyard.</p>
<p>The layout of the courtyard is also quite ingenious. There are winding rivers, prominent rockeries, lotus ponds, pavilions, and terraces. Currently, what attracts tourists the most are probably the two dense, beautiful peony and peony gardens.</p>
<p>Because this library combines the characteristics of a museum, a zoo, an antique exhibition hall, and a park, it attracts a particularly large number of tourists. Every day, tourists come and go in a crowded fashion. While some of them are here to read, most of them are here for sightseeing.</p>
<p>The scenery of Daming Lake varies with the seasons, and the number of tourists also varies with the seasons. Spring and summer are the peak seasons for tourists, while autumn and winter are relatively less crowded. Daming Lake in the spring is like a newly dressed maiden, so it is most likely to stimulate people's desire to visit. Daming Lake in the summer is the most suitable time to enjoy oneself. Driving a small boat, letting it drift and sway in all directions of the lake, watching the lotus flowers, eating lotus seeds, chewing lotus root under the flowers, and cooling off, one truly forgets all the troubles of the world.</p>
<p>There are two types of tourist boats in the lake, large and small. Small boats have no cabins and can seat three or four people. There is a tea table in the middle, where people can sit around and enjoy tea. Large boats are so-called "painted boats." The hull is very large, with glass cabins on top and many decorations inside. Because these boats are too expensive, they are mostly used by families, groups, or wealthy people. Ordinary tourists rarely inquire about them. As for yachts rowed by individuals, there are no rentals, except for those privately owned.</p>
<p>There is a grand gathering in Daming Lake every year. This is the Ullambana Festival on the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month. On this day, most of the ancestral halls and temples around the lake hold ceremonies such as sacrifices and salvation. Lotus lanterns and fireworks are set off everywhere in the lake. Therefore, the men, women, old, and young people of Jinan City gather around the lake in droves.</p>

<h3>Playing Mahjong</h3>
<p>— Helping the Nation</p>
<p>Playing mahjong is generally considered a boring pastime, wasting time and delaying work. But this game, compared with "dog racing," "horse racing," and "roulette," has more of a game nature and does not contain much gambling interest. If we determine the outcome not by winning or losing money, but by the skill of the game, then playing mahjong is instead an art, similar in nature to playing Go and chess.</p>
<p>At first glance, playing mahjong seems to be a simple matter that relies entirely on luck, but in fact, there are many clever principles involved. Confucius said: "Even small paths have something worth seeing." In the matter of playing mahjong, one can also examine people's intelligence and skills. From a philosophical point of view, it has even more value for research.</p>
<p>Everything that happens has a reason. When causes and conditions come together, they inevitably produce a certain result. There is no effect without a cause, and no cause without an effect. This principle is called the law of causality in philosophy. But on the other hand, there are many accidental events that seem to have no causal laws to follow. Scientific research is based on the law of causality; if there were no law of causality, scientific research would become impossible. However, in the context of games and gambling, people generally say it's accidental, it's luck. So, which of these two views is right and which is wrong? We can study this from the matter of playing mahjong.</p>
<p>If we only talk about whether a certain side "completes the hand" or not, or "completes the hand" more or less, then it may be considered accidental; when Party A is already "waiting for the hand," and the tile they are waiting for is very likely to appear, but people just won't discard it, Party B's hand is very bad, and it is not easy for others to discard, but Party A just can't complete the hand, and Party B completes it instead. This seems purely accidental. However, this is only from the perspective of Party A, or only from the perspective of Party B. On the surface, it seems to be accidental, but it is not because Party A, Party B, and the other two parties are all taken into consideration together. If we know the hands of all four parties and examine the tiles that have already been discarded, then the reasons why Party A thinks it's easy to complete the hand but doesn't, and Party B thinks it's not easy to complete the hand but does, become fully clear. This proves that in the event of playing mahjong, there is still a law of causality governing it, and it is by no means purely based on luck and accident. What Party A calls accidental is because they do not know the situation of Party B and the other two parties. Therefore, it is said that accident is an event that occurs without knowing its cause or without fully knowing its cause. So, it is said that accident falls under the category of necessity.</p>
<p>But can we say that accident is purely subjective and does not exist objectively? That is also not the case. We can look at playing mahjong again. Party A has their own arrangements, plans, the composition of their hand, how it comes about, and how it goes, all have certain rules. Following these rules can achieve the hope of completing the hand. If one does not know how to play, does not look at the external situation, and does not follow the path of one's own hand, that is, does not follow the law of development of one's own hand, then one will win less and lose more. But there are also such things: no matter how ingeniously you plan and how meticulously you estimate, you still cannot complete the hand. What is the reason for this? Clearly, someone has a "useless tile" in their hand, but they just won't discard it, and instead discard another tile. What is the reason for this? No matter how many "tiles" you need, they just happen to be stacked on the bricks near the end, so you can't get them. Isn't this accidental? It can be seen that accidental facts also exist objectively, and are not entirely due to a lack of subjective knowledge.</p>
<p>But are accidentality and necessity contradictory and coexisting at the same time? Yes, accidentality and necessity coexist at the same time. This is a contradiction, but contradictions are unified in reality. This can also be illustrated from the matter of playing mahjong. In the entire movement process, such as in the entire journey of playing mahjong, whether someone succeeds or fails, whether someone wins or loses, is governed by the entire law of causality. However, in the movement system of each individual, although there is also a law of causality governing it, this is governed by the common overall law of causality, and the law of automatic movement of each party is also affected by the movement laws of the other parties, that is, they interact with each other. When the partial laws conflict with the overall laws, when the laws of each part conflict with each other, accidental events arise. Therefore, it is said that accidental events also exist objectively.</p>
<p>Precisely because there are both necessity and accident existing objectively, the people playing mahjong have various forms of winning and losing. Some people who are skilled in the game can lose to people who are unskilled. This is because they themselves can only follow the law of movement of their own hand and roughly grasp the law of movement of the whole game, but cannot fully know the whole arrangement, and they have no chance to obtain certain tiles. Because of these unforeseen reasons, they fail. And some people, although their skills are not refined, happen to be in line with the overall law of movement, and accidentally obtain certain tiles, so they can succeed. However, we are definitely not saying that playing mahjong is entirely based on chance. If you proceed along the right path and have a high possibility of completing the hand, but you discard the wrong tile, or do not pay attention to the situation of the whole game, then you will most likely make mistakes. If you have bad luck, but can firmly grasp the laws of yourself and the whole game, you will not completely help the enemy. That is, acting from the law of causality of movement, the power of human action has an effect.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that playing mahjong also has a set of very profound philosophical principles, and we should not take it lightly.</p>

<h3>The Knife That Beheaded Louis XVI</h3>
<p>— Fan</p>
<p>Recently, a valuable item was auctioned at a Paris auction house, namely the guillotine knife that once beheaded the former French Emperor Louis XVI. It is said that at the beginning of the auction, someone offered two thousand francs, and then it gradually increased, and the result was sold for twelve thousand five hundred francs; the buyer is specialized in collecting memorabilia from the French Revolution era.</p>
<p>After the news of this incident spread, some French people who often fantasize said: If you want your descendants to become rich, you should pay attention to the things of people in high positions who die today; whether it is a pistol, bomb, or hammer, you must keep them well and pass them down as family heirlooms, generation after generation, and at some point, they will naturally be worth a lot of money.</p>

<h3>Pancake Stall (End)</h3>
<p>— Ms. Shen Airong</p>
<p>"Oh! Little Gouzi is going to school to study, congratulations! Little Gouzi's mom, your days of being a madam are coming soon. Don't forget us poor neighbors!"</p>
<p>"Such a big child, instead of thinking about earning some money, he wants to learn the airs of a young master and go to school to study. Hey! A crow wants to learn to be a phoenix, it's just not a match."</p>
<p>"As the saying goes: 'Dragons beget dragons, phoenixes beget phoenixes, and the son of a rat will dig holes.' I think, the son of a pancake maker won't develop to any extent."</p>
<p>When these sarcastic words reached Little Gouzi's mom's ears, she was naturally very angry, but her competitive and strong personality made her will even stronger. Not only did she not let her son drop out of school, but she also urged him even more strictly.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Little Gouzi's mom is a pauper now, but a year ago, she was also a madam! Although it was a pancake shop madam. Her dad—Gengsheng, ran a pancake shop, and only had this precious daughter, so he couldn't bear to marry her off, so he recruited a shop assistant to live in the house, who is now Little Gouzi's dad, a very honest and thrifty person. The young couple got along very well, and helped Gengsheng make pancakes diligently and thriftily, and they could get by. Later, Gengsheng passed away and left his only inheritance—the pancake shop—to them, and also left them a debt—the expenses for the funeral. After her dad died, Little Gouzi's mom's life fell into extreme hardship: the market was so bad that even a three-copper-coin pancake and fried dough stick was too expensive to eat, and prices were so high that they couldn't make even one yuan a day. After deducting the cost, the remaining money was only enough for daily food expenses. How could they pay the monthly rent of twenty yuan, the shop assistant's salary of three yuan, and the debt of thirty yuan? There was no way to increase income, so they could only cut expenses, tighten, tighten. First, they fired the shop assistant, and Little Gouzi's mom took over the shop assistant's position, starting the stove later and turning off the stove earlier, which could save some coal; the pancakes were made smaller, the fried dough sticks were made shorter, and less sugar or salt was added, which could reduce costs. But this self-destructive policy of cutting corners not only did not make the economy more prosperous, but instead drove away customers. Business became more and more sluggish, life became more difficult, and the debt collector's footsteps almost flattened the threshold of the pancake shop. Finally, they couldn't maintain it, and they had to transfer the shop to someone else, pay off the debts, and move to the slums with a monthly rent of three yuan. They spent five yuan to donate a permit and set up a pancake stall in the French Concession. Thanks to Little Gouzi's mom's competence and Little Gouzi's dad's thriftiness, the expenses were saved, and there were no debts, and the business was better than before, because they added new products such as sugar sesame balls, crispy sesame flowers, and crispy biscuits, and they were made large and delicious, and customers praised them when they ate them.</p>
<p>Little Gouzi's mom had been a madam, and among the group of women in the slums, she could be regarded as the best. Because of this, Little Gouzi's mom was different from the other women in the slums. She couldn't stand the sight of neatly dressed madams at all, and she couldn't have a trace of awe or admiration for the madams. Sometimes, when she saw the wife of the fruit seller Afa, calling out "Madam," "Madam" loudly to the beautiful female customers, she always laughed at her for being a complete slave. After the customers left, she put on a disdainful look and sneered at Afa's wife: "Madam? How much does madam buy per catty? Is it worth your flattery? Wasn't Little Gouzi's mom also born a madam? What's the use of their twisting their necks and wiggling their butts and putting on airs? When bad luck comes, I'm afraid they won't even have a way to beg for food!"</p>
<p>Not only did she not have good feelings for noble and wealthy madams, but she also hated the maids and elder sisters employed by the madams, and she didn't like to see their ugly faces of bullying others. So, when the maids and elder sisters came to her place to buy fried dough sticks, she deliberately cut the noodles slowly, pressed the two overlapping noodles heavily with a rolling pin, and gently placed them in the oil pan to fry. Sometimes, when the maids and elder sisters waited impatiently and urged her, she fried them even slower, using long bamboo chopsticks to move the fried dough sticks back and forth in the oil pan, and secretly cursed in her stomach: "You want to be arrogant with three copper coins, if I don't fry them for you, what can you do? You dog-like thing, go back and be scolded by your mistress, that will also make me happy."</p>
<p>Apart from disliking talkative neighbors and the arrogant maids and elder sisters, Little Gouzi's mom was polite to everyone else. She didn't hate anyone, didn't envy anyone, and didn't admire anyone. She only used her particularly strong body, buried herself in work, didn't complain about the heavens, didn't blame others, didn't cry out for hardship, and didn't slack off, because she had a beautiful fantasy that was driving her to work hard, that her two little treasures—Little Gouzi and Little Lazi—would be able to stand out in the future, jump out of the slums, and step into the ranks of the gentry. As for whether the life of the gentry was as beautiful as she imagined, that was not something Little Gouzi's mom could know. (End)</p>
