<p>遠東軍總部宣稱、「關東軍總部之上列兩項通告、全係捏造、目的在蒙蔽民衆、掩飾滿洲兵變眞相、並代日滿軍之向蘇聯邊境挑釁辯護、遠束軍總部已完全證實、一月二十九日伯力塔斯社關於滿軍越入蘇聯境內報吿、及一月三十日關於日滿軍、襲擊蘇聯邊境報吿之完全正確、」遠束軍總部特別證實、滿洲軍之越入蘇聯境內、立被繳械，並被遣入蘇境伏洛希洛夫城、使共不能與日滿軍衝突、全市界（包括關束軍總部）均知蘇聯軍官以忠誠態度、遵守蘇聯政府之指導、堅决推行和平政策、密切注視其國際義務、而蘇聯軍隊之侵入他國則爲全不可能、</p>

<p>英國又成了世界的中心了。她從　濟恐慌中的回復是突過任何巨大的資本主義國家的。但是國內却仍有着二百萬的失業者和大量停滯着的工業。大不列顚繁榮的頂點，終於是過去了。她正想賴她已往的光榮和遺產生存着。這根本的貧乏鼓動了其他列强對那全世界一向認爲不可侵犯的不列顚的地位施行進攻；但是經濟回復的自信，和因「逗弄着獅子尾巴」的入太多而引起的感情却又使英國企圖重振她的威力。</p>
<p>繁榮時的不列顚曾帮助意大利在紅海一帶建立殖民地。今日的不列顚却反對意國侵入這同一的地帶了。這一點，在意阿事伴上正反映着一個劃時代的轉變。</p>
<p>英國爲甚麽這樣的老實？當一九三一年九月日本佔奪滿洲的時候，倫敦竟給國聯絆住了不動。艾登最近在下院辯解說，這是由於「二大鄰國（美國和蘇聯）不是國聯會員國」的綠故，然而不對，因爲美國在倫敦和日內瓦曾竭力要求制裁侵略者，而蘇俄在這一點上也頗樂於合作的。英國縱容日本在中國的侵略——不去阻止它——因爲有幾處不列顚地方對日本抱同情，因爲日本的前進政策是反蘇聯的，又因爲唐寗街想不到滿洲之後還有華北，甚至還有上海，一個侵略的强國一旦達到某種運動量，就必然地踏上了戰爭之路，以後的事實使英國認識了這一點，她這纔决定趁事情還沒擴大之前去阻止意國了。讓世界知過獅子已變成了小貓是危險的啊！去年十月　十三日，正當意阿戰爭之時，包爾溫首相曾經說：「民主制度的弱點之一，就是非到了最後的關頭，它可决不敢去面對眞實的。」這正是一九三五年不列顚民主政治一個絕妙的註釋。意大利已把英國逼到最後關頭了。如果英國還是一個權威的帝國，她必須有以證明。吾則，她的衰落便將成爲確定的事實了。</p>
<p>鮑爾溫先生的民主政治所不敢面對的眞實就是意國向不列顚帝國的挑戰。法西斯主義已把意大利變做了一支巨大的軍事力量。墨索里尼特別注意於空中的軍備。奧加斯大和離馬爾太九十五哩的西西里飛機庫裏的轟炸機，可以很容易的使島上的炮臺失效而把英國關出東地中海。還有，意國在利比亞的戎兵就增加了，意人正對埃及表示着一種可疑的注意，而埃及地位本已給風湧的國民黨（Waid）反英運動弄得很糟，倫敦這纔開始正視墨索里尼在東非集中三十萬大軍的嚴重威脅了。不列顚帝國的中心就是尼羅河，英國對於這個區域內發生的任何事情，是非常敏戚的。一八九八年英國和法國就是爲了蘇丹的法沙達事伴幾乎開了戰。一個意大利控制下的阿比西尼亞，可以割開開普敦到開羅的連繫可以截斷到印度的交通錢。斯墨資將軍曾大聲疾呼說：不列顚的有色臣民有反叛的可能，這個警吿更使唐寗街添了不少內心的煩悶。不列顚帝國是一個有色的帝國，三千七百萬的英屬非洲人正目光犀利地注視着阿比西尼亞呢。如果墨索里尼毀滅了這個非洲最後的獨立國。英國便要受任意縱容的責備。如果「萬王之王」（阿比西尼亞王）打敗了或逐出了意軍，白人的威信就歸於掃地，兩者都不是辦法，因此最好的辦法是買通墨索里尼。</p>
<p>總之，不列顚政府是猶豫不能决了。意國征阿的最後計畫，還是在一九三四年秋天擬定的。當一九三五年的初頭，美國駐地中海各海港的領事曾報吿有大軍開赴以里特里亞這些不列顚自然是多少知道的。墨索里尼公開的說他曾於一九三五年一月二十九日把他征阿的意思吿訴英內閣，他與賴伐爾對征阿妥協的協定是一月初旬締結的，消息靈通的唐寗街當然不能不顧這事實。顯然的，不列顚確曾有所表示過，因爲我知道去年三月十七日意政府用了書面向英政府擔保，說阿比西尼亞問題决不致用武力去解决。然而墨索里尼畢竟採取武力解决的辦法了。</p>
<p>一九三五年歐洲歷史上的重要日子是三月十六日，在這天，希特勒撕破了凡爾賽和的而宣佈重整軍備。全歐震驚了。四月十一日，法國英國和意國大家集議於斯特萊柴的小鎭。墨索里尼親自出席，還有賴伐爾。麥唐納和西門。意大利趁機在斯特萊柴吿訴英國阿比西尼亞問題的專家，說黑衣首相又决定要用兵於阿比西尼亞了。他完全看到了英國正注意於德國的新威脅。他的手段是聰明的，果然專家把這消息報吿了西門，西門和麥唐納却誰也沒有對意國代表提起這題目。在前决國會解散前的衆院辯論中，路易喬治曾反問艾登這一點。艾登解釋說：一三大强國還只的定集體的維持國聯範疇內的和平，三强之一却又到別處大陸去自由行動破壊國聯了，這簡直是難以想像的。」多麽幼稚啊！墨索里尼明明把西門和麥唐納的沉默當作默許而前進了。不列顚可給德國嚇昏了麽？還是他們以爲意大利會給德國從奧地利侵入的威脅嚇住不動呢？也許都是。然而他們却不能認識那把意大利推向戰爭的暗中力量。</p>
<p>一九三五年六月十八日，英國和德國締結海軍協定，一時又驚動了世界。這樣修補好了她對德國的藩籬，同時更探知德國的戰爭準備尙未成熟，故如一旦意國發動了另一戰爭時，不列顚便能集中力量注意阿比西尼亞。這樣她便穩固多了。</p>
<p>但去年六月廿四日艾登在羅馬與墨索里尼會商英德海軍協定後所發表的公報，結果只是表示英國同意於意大利的侵略。爲消釋威脅的印象，艾登提議犧牲阿國而以若干土地的經濟的讓與給意大利，同時又將紅海的齊拉港和一條經過英屬索謀里蘭的狹長走廊給阿國，藉以加深阿國對不列顚的倚賴。墨索里尼却乾脆地拒絕了。他不要禮物，當然更不要些微的東西。「我不是沙漠的收藏家！」就是他的憤語。現在不列顚政府纔明白墨索里尼所存心的事業了。意大利也許輕視了不列顚的力量，而認爲她永遠在躊躇之中，因爲躊躇原是戰後不列顚外交的特徵。這可是羅馬嚴重的錯誤了。</p>

<p>我們爲什麼學算學？和怎樣學算學？（下）　大夏大學敎授　任孟閑　（二十五年一月九日十一日對全國中等校學生講）</p>
<p>第三等是平時不燒香，臨時抱佛脚的學生；但因他知道臨時工作，救濟得早，成績也還不錯，第二等是敎師敎到何處，他就學到何處，並不特別加緊，祇是按着常規，循序漸進的學生；此等學生，實巳不可多得！而第一等的學生，則在事前，就自動努力起來，不待敎師的督促，不爲考試的分數而用功，而成績自瑧上乘；這種學生，允其是鳳毛麟角，絕無僅有的了！這種注重事前的方法，就是我今天要介紹給諸君的三個學習程序中最重要的一步，是那三個學習程序呢？</p>
<p>第一，課前預習　普通人對於用功二字的解釋，都是指課後的努力而言，而以課前的准備囑諸敎師，很少人主張學生在課前也要准備的。我把這准備工作，叫做預習，預習是學習過程中最重要的一個階段。譬如看影片，若事前沒有看過說明書，就是片子演得怎樣有精采，也覺素然寡味，看影片且要預習，何况學算學？我們如在課前，把所有研究的定理或方法，先行理會一下，遇有疑點，做個說號，以備上課的時候去問敎師，則不待煩言，便可明瞭。諸君要知道學習任何學科，要有心得，須先有問題，而問題須自己發現，纔覺親切有味，纔可搔着癢處。吾則敎師敎得高明，固不能領會，敎得不周到，亦無所用其懷疑，輕輕放過，這便是學習的第一步沒有成功，最爲可惜。</p>
<p>第二，課時注意　旣有了第一步課前預習，上課時更聚精會神，聽受敎師的發問和講解，以及其他同學的討論，如果我的疑點，未經有人說明，即可隨時提出，以求解答。於是關於所學事項，在上課時便可完全了解，否則學習的第二步，便沒有成功，雖會預習，也屬徒然。我們要知道第一步預習如已拋荒，尙可賴第二步補救，假使第一步既經放棄，第二步又未充分注意，那就一誤再誤，不可挽回了！　我常見許多學生上課不帶紙筆，閒着兩手，呆坐了五十分鐘，究竟他們心裏想的什麼？無從曉得，也有一面聽講，一面手裹做別的工作，也有互相談話，甚至垂頭假寐，種種奇形怪狀，不一而足。諸君要知道算學這門功課，祇要在開學後一兩星期上課數小時內，隨便忽略過去，以後的困難便多了。因爲這種學科，一步一步的進修，絕非難事。但若跨了一步，便覺節節爲難，以後縱能勉强補齊，那種忙淸追思趕着補習的情形，是非常痛苦的！我願這些靑年，立時覺悟，利用他們寶貴的上課時間！</p>
<p>第三，課後練習　算學是不僅重理解，更須有充分練習的學科。因爲練習的效用有四：一，可以澈底了解所習的理論，二，可以密切應用已知的方法，三，可以熟記有用的公式，四，可以自山解答所遇的問題，算學上學理的深奧，方式的紛繁，問題的變化多方，不可名狀，等等公認的困難，惟有勤加練習，多做習題，可以解决，可以救濟。但是一般學生，無不感覺算學的習題太多，練習的時間不足。其實他們在短少的自修時間內，不僅要做演習的功課，還要先下一番理解的工夫。他們旣未預習於事前，叉於上課時未能集中注意，待到課後，方纔開始用功，敎師所講何事，茫無印象，乃不得不努力自修，於是天資聰慧的學生，純出於自學自演，時間自愈不敷；拙笨一點的，便無從着手了！這就是一誤再誤乃至於三誤，結果算學的成績不良，不是算學誤人，實在是學者自誤啊！</p>
<p>有人說：我於課前預備了，課時注意了，課後也練習了，但考時仍覺忙得不堪成績依然不好，這是什麼原因呢？如果有這種悄形，一方面可以說是敎師考試嚴格，學校辦理認眞；一互面又可以說學習的方法，尙有研究的餘地。</p>
<p>更正　昨日敎育播昔專刊本文第三排第二十五行「上面說過……」起，至第四排第三十五行「……最大目的的最好方法」止，爲本文結論，應接在此處，而拚版時誤接在「總之學算學可矯正社會上種種不良習慣……」以前，特此更正。</p>

<p>窗上玻璃大概受了冷氣緊逼的原故，爆開一條裂痕來，因為我的床就在這面玻璃窗旁邊，夜裏沒有醒轉，天明起來，忽然覺着嗅覺呼吸的工作，頓呈困難之象，啊！是在患傷風了！我想：我夜裏並沒有受凍，怎麽會傷風呢？後來我朝窗外望陽光是吾上了屋角，陡然，我臉頰上刺進一陣寒慄，感覺着不快：哦，到此刻我才覺着外面寒氣，是從玻璃裂痕裏透進來的；同時，也明瞭我之所以會傷風了！</p>
<p>用紙條把裂痕糊好，沒兩天，我仍恢復原狀；但我想起這一條小小裂痕，是多麽可怕啊！假如我們行為上呈現了裂痕，不就得成為社會上的病蟲了嗎？我們須做人類中的康健者！但一方須得行為愼重上不能現有裂痕的！朋友：你們不要看小了這一條微末的裂痕呀，一個漏巵，酒是不會留存一滴的！我們不去彌補那行為上的裂痕，那麽人格方面，就會逐漸的喪失了啊！</p>

<p>射擊，是訓練民衆工作的耍件，鄉人們在冬季農暇的時候，三五成羣的集合在一起，把一個葫蘆，用繩子掛在大樹上，然後輸流着向那個葫蘆射擊，每人射過五發或十發之後，把葫蘆放下來，看一看有多少子彈命中，以騐各人的射擊本領如何？還有一種射擊，是用一片圓的木爿，另外一個人，把木爿向地上滾去，旁邊的人就射擊。這是練習打獵時射擊正在跑着的野獸。</p>
<p>練習射擊的方法很多，手槍射擊，一定要腕力特別好的人，方能掌握住槍的震動力，對於所要射擊的目標，才不致於脫空。不過這是一種很難的射擊；雖然槍上有「準星」。但不能像步槍那樣容易瞄準，所以全憑個人的射擊天才的。吾則，就是給你許多時間和子彈，照樣的還是槍槍打不上。</p>

<p>— 一葉</p>
<p>世界馳名的離婚市，——美國的里諾市，有一位任了二十四年法官的茅朗氏，近發表一則關於婚姻的危險時期的意見。他說，在初結婚的十五年中，是最危險的時期。在這危險的十五年之後，十分之九，都是能白頭偕老，很少有再相見於法庭而離婚的。這位法官，在這二十四年中，曾斷决三萬件左右的離婚案，所以他的話，當然是相當可靠的。</p>
<p>根據着他的經騐，他奉勸一般的靑年夫婦，在初結婚的十五年中，須對於一切瑣屑之事，極力容忍與留意。他說，在他斷决的離婚案中，大部幾都是為了一些極小的衝突。舉幾個例：一個丈夫，把粉撲在他妻子的衣服上，以為戲謔，以致衝突而離婚；一個丈夫，因把湯潑着他的妻子而衝突；一個丈夫，因他的妻子，不滿意於他買的東西而發生惡感。他說，容忍，是同居的最耍條件，而在初結婚的十五年中，是最難容忍的時期。</p>

<h3 id="c161">石井鄕的國勝瓶 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 謝憫生</p>
<p>凡讀過　史的人們，都知道淸初有個民族英雄鄭成功的姓氏，後來他雖失敗，但他那「踞金　　　抗天下全師　的威名，還是千秋不會泯滅的，道裏我所談的「國勝瓶」，就是他的事蹟了。</p>
<p>記得前年和家人回我的老家，途徑厦門，順便去訪個石井鄕的朋友，（石井即鄭成功的故鄕）在他書案上，看見陳列着一個很古雅的花瓶，瓶口挿了幾朵梅花，我問那朋友，據說是「國勝瓶」，（國勝是鄭成功的諱名）上旁有兩個耳鈞，可以繫繩懸掛在客廳供點綴，但這非容易買得夾的，說是民族英雄遺下來，很可寳貴的紀念品。因為當時鄭成功據守金厦二島，集衆練兵，準備推倒滿人，復興漢族，那時候軍械和戰時用具，還不甚發達，只有烏龍砲赤蛇槍，都是鄭成功親自監製的，並不需用舶來品一銅一鐵。在緊急行軍的當兒，因缺乏盛火藥的用具，就督促軍士們，掘土製成一萬個，以炭火焙燃，就變為陶器了，乃分發給軍中應用，誰知道這决却遭淸兵所暗算，結果失敗，戰船數十艘，被困在南安石井的海外，沈沒死亡的也不少。而陸軍陣勢又被抄圍，有多數英烈戰士，不願死在敵人的刀下，紛紛投入石井江殉難了。那盛火藥的用具，（即國勝瓶）都遺落在這江底，後來附近的漁人，在潮退時，發現了不少的陶瓶子，拾歸以詢遺老，說是這一段戰史，因此就名之為「國勝瓶」。初時村中人還不甚注意，因南洋羣島和都市裹的騷人達官們，都以重余購買挿養鮮花，目為寳物，而漁人也拚命搜拾，居為奇貨，每一瓶竟有售價至四十餘元，因此「國勝瓶」，就成為貴族的古玩了。現在江底雖經漁人幾番打撈，也匕難得，據一般古玩家說：近來有人偽造取財，但眞贗却很容易辨得出，眞的可養花至八個月不須換水，贗品的數日不換水，即生蛆發臭了，我不是收藏者，無從證明，或許有些近於神話罷。</p>

<h3 id="c162">城隍廟雜談 <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>以一個聚集商品為市塲，而把神權崇拜做誘惑力的滬南城隍廟，早經被認為上海市的名勝之部。而它的精神，實在可以極度表現出中國人的懶散的特質，故異國旅行者必需來此觀光，認為反映民挨意識唯一準確的　庫。芥川龍之介在他的中國遊訊中，曾譏諷這一座大廟，和日本的「綠日」相似。而國人們却全看做與蘇州的玄妙觀，南京的夫子廟，同具有頹敗骯髒，喧囂黯淡的缺點。其實，芥川龍之介的諷刺，只是十四年前的觀察，到如今巳不適合；只要看一看各家商店與攤基的陳設，整齊地排列於闊大的水門汀街的兩面，一到黃昏，雪亮的電火，照耀着巍峨嚴肅的市樓，就是在廟堂之內，也找不到帶有烟煤的匾額，而吸收着飽滿的太陽光了。何况玄妙觀與夫子廟的建築，又不能步武現代型而利用鋼骨水泥？　惟有一種不可諱言的事實，那便是在紅花崗石所琢成的九曲橋下，那潭綠得發黑的水，老是不想調換，而却養活了由菩薩心腸的善男信女所放生的烏龜鱗甲，在夏天噴出不可耐的異一味。這不但予遊賞者的心目中，增加一重厭惡一的觀感，就以公衆衛生而論，也不得不督促市衛生當局的注意！</p>
<p>其次，在九曲橋的轉折之處，往往坐着男女乞丐，一個籃，一根棒，而復展覽他們不知用什麽化裝成的胖腿子或鮮血淋漓的手臂；將此以喚起有聞階級的憐恤。雖然瞧了也能使人苦痛，但出賣殘廢的伎倆，究竟不能算是新生活，何况丟一句官話說時，在「中外觀瞻所縏「的名勝區中，呈露這個「歪曲的健康，」怕不能當做國際體面的吧？</p>
<p>提起　曲橋，不得不使我更想到橋上的明月雖則不能像杜牧之唱出「玉人何處敎吹簫」的名句，而橋下的水又是比不得二十四個環龍裏的淸澄涵虛；但你要是在深夜人靜時，一個兒踽踽凉凉地跑到湖心亭的石壇上一坐，聽輕風梳動柳絲，倒映於月色照着深籃的濁波上，便有無數浮盪的　影，隨着黑波微笑。而且湖底的游魚，偶然聽見人聲，也會撥動尾巴，神奇地跳躍，在月明中，急遽地一瞥，像柄銀色的　刀。對面就是一座綠漆的「小世界」，已不像剛才的：繁絃急管，人影幢幢；而却啞默地靜止着，恰像一個跳舞的姑娘感到疲倦而酣睡着的樣子。它是卸　了艶裝，水鑽似的電炬完全熄滅，熱的情緒凍成冰塊，紅的火焰變了死灰。這夜，何等淸冷！何等殘酷！况又有月。在這的環　　，是　不了獨坐空山俛仰宇宙的感覺的！我想：李太白在采石磯頭為何騎鯨，蔣叔南在雁宕石門潭中為何投是，是有着更深的意境！變着月的誘惑！……而我？說來也還平凡粗俗！可愧！</p>
<p>偶然讀淸朝一代通儒毛祥麟氏（上海人）的墨餘錄」，其中有一段記述說：「一日，偕遊豫園。見石梁跨水上，因擬乘月夜遊，謂其潭淸鏡澄，境必勝於畫也。是晚，適値月明如盡，漏三下，全將寢矣；忽聞叩門聲，啟視則齊子也。曰：見此月色，寢不能寐，能赴日間之的乎？余曰：可，遂與踏月北行，漫步至園，樣度平橋九曲，登溪西一山。四望月皓如銀，下明凈。山巓有小亭，於此少憇。繼至石梁，見有數丐偃臥欄邊。余曰：此非先得我心者乎？相與大笑。……</p>
<p>看了上面的短文，來認識現在的豫園不也還是老樣？所不同者，從前的九曲橋是木質的，而現在改成花崗石了；從前可以任人走進大假山，故而有着「登溪西一山」的句子　現在萃秀堂雖將開放，尙未實現。至於從前有乞丐偃臥園中，現在也還如此，而且連白畫也現形。從前的水：「潭淸鏡澄」，「上下明凈」，現在却暗碧腐臭，不謀更換。時代一天一天向科學的路上邁進，而公衆設施，只老是停頓在靜止的狀態中，　不叫人徬徨憂慮呢？此而不能，還想打倒迷信？毀減神秘？於是我對於芥川龍之介的警句：「在廟裏，那面走着穿漂亮洋服綴着紫水晶的領結定針的中國時髦人，這面走着戴了銀項圈的三寸小脚的舊式婦人。金瓶梅中的陳敬濟，品花寳鑑中的奚十一——在道許多人裏面，這類的豪傑似乎也有着。而什麼杜甫，什麽王陽明，什麽諸葛亮；却似乎一個找不出。即使想極力辯護他在說謊，但形式上固然還可以勉強說得過；而精神上又將如何去遮掩這一類懶散特質的表徵？</p>

<p>第二天早晨裴先生進課室的時候，他看去甚為欣然，孩子們正在驚奇不知道他遇到了什麼快樂的事，後來簡直以為他或者發了瘋，因為他直到唐恩的去處，揑住他的兩手，緊緊地握，像是在贊美他，一口氣說道：</p>
<p>『我一切都知道了，我求你原恕。那種做品，正是你的行徑，我為此很愛你，雖然說謊—便是為了朋友—也總是不合的』。</p>
<p>『什麽事呢』？乃德喊道，因為唐恩一字也不說，祇仰起了他的頭，好像他背上的重負已卸脫了。</p>
<p>『唐恩並不拿韜摩的錢』；裴先生說這句話時，竟是高聲喊着，他眞忙樂。</p>
<p>『是誰拿的呢』！童子們齊聲問着。</p>
<p>裴先生指點着一個空位，每個眼睛都跟着那手指的方向，一會兒沒一人說話，因為他們都驚訝不置。</p>
<p>『解客今天大淸早巳回家去了，不過他留下了這一件，這是我今天起來時見到縛在我的門球上的』，接下裝先生就讀着，全室肅靜聽着：</p>
<p>『拿了韜摩的大洋。我從門縫裏見他把洋鈿放到那裏去。我以前怕說，雖然我也想說的。我於乃德到也隨他，可是唐恩是個好漢，我心裏難過，不能再忍下去了。那錢我沒有用；這還在我房裏地毯底下，在　洗台的後面。我心中十分難過。我回去了，我想是不會再回來的，所以我的東西給了唐恩罷。解客』。</p>

<h3 id="c177">談醫藥刊物的價值問題 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 殷占五</p>
<p>我國敎育不能普及，一般人民對於新的知識很難得認識的機會，卽以新的醫藥一事而論：醫藥之輸入我國，可算也有幾十年的歷史，在歐美人家是日新月異地向前猛進，一般人民對於新的醫藥已有了相當的程度，這新的學識也有了相當明瞭。而我國呢？新醫藥輸入的時間是儘管的長，而對於新醫之進步又是如此的短。新醫藥界之不能努力推進，一般民衆們也莫知所事：前不進，後則退，像這樣的局勢，中國人民焉能明瞭新醫藥，而認淸醫藥的重要呢？</p>
<p>誠然，現在的中國，好似成年入學，已知道是不得不努力，不能不用功的時候；儘管現在的國家，是年衰多秋，老弱危亡；而到了一種不可藥救的地步！但一般醫藥界，所謂一般負有先知先覺的醫藥先進者，他們是開始努力，已負担起他們本分應盡的責任。所以我們近來時常發見每個報紙都有醫藥的刋物，並　有很多的醫藥刋物，有出特刋的，有出周刋的；並且看他們的宗旨，也大都是：「普及翳藥常識，發揚新醫藥學術；……」這一類的話為宗旨。的確，這不能不算是醫藥界的努力，也不能不算是我國一般醫藥先進者的大開宏恩；藉診餘之時，利用這大衆的讀物，來互相的討論學術，而發揚新醫藥；同時更來敎育民衆，灌輸民衆的一些新醫藥知識，而普及醫藥；挽救中國目前的衰亡！努力於我國醫藥前途的光明！這實在是値得我們要代表全國同胞，向編輯醫藥刊物的先生們，下一個九十度的鞠躬禮；謝謝他們的好意；同時這也是象徵着我國醫藥前途之有救；而必有與歐美並駕之可能？</p>
<p>然而理想往往不能合乎事實；我們的敬禮雖然是怎樣的鄭重，我們的願望雖然是怎樣的渴切，可是擺佈在我們面前的事實，適値其反；對於現在所刋行的醫藥刊物，恐怕不看到罷，一看不免要使人望紙興嘆！大失所望！（此乃指多數不良的醫藥刋物而言，內容豐富而有眞正價値醫藥刊物，不在此例），所以刊物雖然這樣地多，編輯刊物的先生雖然是怎樣的忙，我們在報紙上所看到的醫藥刋物，其內容豐富，而俱有眞正醫藥刋物的價値問題的，實在是很少，其中允令人痛心的一點：就是有很多勢利的醫院或醫生，藉發行醫藥刊物的名義，佔住報紙的寳貴篇幅，來出上種種的醫藥刋物；表面上他們是大唱着：「普及醫藥常識，發揚新醫藥學術」；這一類美名的高調，而實際上實在是大做廣吿，大吹　螺；呌一般民衆們知道發行這刋物的，是一個××科的醫學專門；或是×國××醫藥學校的醫學博士；並且往往在每篇稿的末尾，還註上：「編者按，這位醫師乃××科專門，診所設於××地址」，或「此藥乃××藥廠出品，該藥廠設於××地址」，等字樣；嗚呼！醫藥刊物之內容如是？醫藥刋物之價値如是？像這樣的刋物，我們怎値得來感激他們？願望他們呢？這難道也合得上所謂「以普及醫藥常識，發揚新醫藥學術的宗旨」；為宗旨嗎？也能談到醫藥刊物的價値問題嗎？所以儘管一般人民的新知識缺乏，一個個都是那種十八世紀的舊腦經，舊思想，不能明瞭新醫藥的一切，但像這樣負有敎育民衆，而欺騙民衆的一般醫藥刋物，也値得要使一般民衆生氣；難怪民衆要說一句：「唉！這都是些騙人的東西」！所以我們雖然有時還可以發見一些內容豐富，以眞正普及醫藥常識，發揚新醫藥學術為宗旨的有價値的醫藥刊物存在；但處於這壞的環境中，惡的潮流下，也不免要受一點影響，易於捲入漩渦的受民衆們一眼看待，而有說上一句：「唉！這都是些騙人的東西」！的可能吧？所以我們如果要為醫藥前途着想，為民衆全體着想，對於醫藥刊物之價値問題，實有一談之必要；富有價値的醫藥刋物我們要擁護他，使他不致於墮落，更努力底向前；無價値而含有欺騙性質的醫藥刊物，我們應當想法取締，有價値的醫藥刋物的內容，一方面固然要專重於學術，而多討論些關於研究醫藥推進與實施等方面的問題；但同時也要注意民衆的敎育問題，對於所載之語句，務必須求大衆化；使一般民衆樂得的接受，努力的認識。關於刊物的編輯，當然我們也希望都是些醫藥專家們主編；我們希望諸位專家們，以所有的學問的專長，儘量地供獻到國家方面，使這雖將於危亡的中國，也增一點個專長，免致外人的刺諷到底吧！願你們所知道的學識，完全地搬將出來，一一的灌輸或普施到民衆方面；為他們摧殘的生命，做一個保障吧！做一個博愛之士吧！</p>
<h3 id="c178">俸給生活與肺病問題 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 郭柏霖</p>
<p>俸給生活者之中，允其是比較薄薪的人，如有罹患肺結核，則大多數是造成着非常悽慘的結果。其原因乃是與罹患感冒等的塲合不同，非短期治療所能痊愈。至少也需要數個月，有時甚至非經過數年間的療病生活則不可，故就是經濟方面不生問題，但公司或洋行方面的休暇問題總要發生困難的。</p>
<p>再尙有一個困難的事情，卽是結核的初期少有自覺苦痛，故普通都是照舊從事工作。而在這種勉强繼續作務之間，曾幾何時輕度的結核已進行至中等程度了。並且這時候已有了輕度的發熱及咳嗽，但是大部分的人，仍是為着生活關係無從作正當的治療。其結果是終於陷入重症的境地了。到了這時節不僅治療困難，有時甚至變成沒法恢復的地步。所以，至少在中等程度的時候卽須迅速施行切實的療法。實際上就是這個時候也有過遲之憾，故最緊要的莫過於輕症的時節。假使這時候不作完全的治療，結果是會在其一生中留下非常悽慘之結果的。</p>
<p>從現代醫學的治病方針來說，被診斷為結核的時候始開始治療已是過遲的療法，故此前患者自身非巳有所感覺不可，同時醫生亦非發見此病症不可，卽是說，非作早期診斷，且又非施早期治療不可的。因為在初期，不　可能不必休息工作而受治療，且又比較容易恢復健康的身體。此卽是一般的治療方針，但是這裏困難的問題，是此種潛伏期，或所謂發病傾向時期，多數的時候因沒有顯著的自覺苦痛，故容易不自覺地忽略過去。</p>
<p>至於此時期的微候，第一是容易厭倦工作，卽始終感到疲勞，同時體重漸减，人覺得一天羸瘦着一天，血色亦不良，有貧血的傾向。</p>
<p>但是此種的形態，並不一切限於結核的初期，其他疾病初期亦有此種象徵，並且有時候亦會出現於一時的過勞之後，故最緊要的問題是其鑑別的注意。</p>
<p>如平日對着自己的健康有着注意的人，這時候該是能感覺到自己的健康發生障礙才對，再比較簡單的診斷法，卽是每天度檢數决的體溫。這樣，將每天所連續檢得的成續註於溫度表，譬如稍為過勞之日，或過度使用腦筋之後，是表現着三十七度二三分的微熱等。故溫度表綫若有不規則之動搖的時候，應速去受醫生的健康診斷，而確定其微熱的原因。</p>
<p>此時節，若是專門醫師，便卽攝影X光照相，或從血液中去檢查種種的性狀，再從噯昧的症狀之中去發見結核發動的初期，但是此若僅普通的單純的健康診斷，則往往有不能明瞭其眞相，故可疑的時侯，是時要受健康診斷，允其是仰求可靠的專門醫生的健康診斷。</p>
<p>有這種狀態的人——卽是有結核的發病傾向的人，再加上職業上的過勞或運動的過度，乃至飲酒，更夜，或其他不攝生等，結果終於發生眞正的發病狀態者，是世間常有的經過。</p>
<p>過勞之外，最多數的是罹患感冒而發病的塲合。俗謂感冒並非指一定的固定疾病而言，大凡發熟的疾患都加指為威冒。而此感冒之後汗熱不退，繼續咳嗽或咯痰等的時候，其以為發病狀態者亦不少數。</p>
<p>威冒之外，因胃腸之障害而發熱的時節，其延久的結果，亦往往有變成結核的實例。故這種塲合，亦必要相當注意，而施行完全的治療。</p>
<p>至其痊愈若過於長久的時候，則須以結核的疑問，受專問醫師的健康診斷為最要緊。</p>
<p>但是世人的大多數，總過注重於避免結核之感染的所謂豫防的項目上面。卽是注重於怎樣纔不會受結核的空氣感染的項目上了，然而他們却不知道成人的大多數，是早已受着感染的。</p>
<p>但雖然已有了感染，可是結核决不一定發病，又雖擁有相當的潛伏結核，但却一向非常活動而無何等碍礙的人，也是極其多數。所以，結核豫防問題的主眼，是在於使無害形態之潛伏結核不表面化的方針了。卽，威染豫防是對外的豫防，但發病豫防却是自己的豫防。</p>
<p>至於結核的發病，大抵係在體力過度衰弱的時候。故鮮有筋肉運動之機會的俸給生活者，禮拜天的休假日等决不可作過度的運動，他如暴飲暴食，深夜等的不攝生的娛樂，亦應極力避免。</p>
<p>不過，適當的運動，是大有益處的。雖是短時間亦該每天實行。特別是起床時或就眠時的冷水摩擦，或輕度的散步及輕度的體操等，是大有獎勵的必要哩。</p>

<h3 id="c179">類癎Catalepsy <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>－醫學故事之十七—</p>
<p>有人統計，在每二十四小時內，世界上有一人被活埋。這是怎樣一回事呢？</p>
<p>據說，光是在美國境內，平均每一星期中有一人患「類癎」。類癎是靜睡狀態，是生命的停止——人體生理的全部重要法則都暫時停頓，這情景使醫生宣吿患者已死，使患者的家屬預備給他埋葬，但其實他並沒有死，過幾天或十餘天他會醒過來的。</p>
<p>類癎是屬於催眠狀態的領域的，因為它純粹是客觀意識的睡眠，是重要機能的停頓，是全部重要器官的休憇。對於完全健康的人，可以用催眠術的暗示使他入於類癎狀態。或者，在長久的疾病或神經疲倦之後，也會引起類癎的。不論原因如何，現象却是相同的——溫和的睡眠。</p>
<p>在某種疾病，允其是神經失序，暫時的類癎狀態往往表示疾病的頂峯，同時也表示疾病的段落。在這期間，造化以極大的努力使耗疲的神經得到它們應需的休憇。患者享受着絕對的休憇，免除一切的痛苦。重要的生理法則一齊停頓，因此他得享受休養的睡眠—這睡眠是這麼酣熟，至於使旁觀者疑心它就是它的孿生兄弟「死」。這昏睡狀態的久暫與深淺，是和患者的疾病的程度與休息及回復健康的需要成正比的。</p>
<p>在診治此項患者的時候，最大的錯誤是用外力回復他的意識。假如此舉成功，那就不但造成給予神經的有害的震動，而且干涉造化給予病人自然療治的努力。在另一方面，要是此舉不成功，那就不啻戕害患者並未完盡的生命，因為根據醫生的報吿，家屬一定認患者已死而把他活活埋葬了。</p>
<p>實例的證據是有的。若干年前，印定那坡里斯（Indianapolis）地方附近，有一少婦，在重病之後突然昏厥了。六個醫生在施行通常的試騐之後都說她已死。偏偏她有一個小兄弟，天天緊伴着她，說她並沒有死。到了第十四天，突然的，這少婦張開嘴巴來了，而她的小兄弟好像看見她的舌頭伸動着</p>
<p>「阿姊，你要什麼？」小兄弟呌着問。</p>
<p>「水」，從屍體的口中發出低微的回答。</p>
<p>水給注入她的口中，她居然活過來了。她繼續活了許多年。</p>
<p>據從類癎醒過來的人說，在類　期中，他雖不能動彈，意識却是完全淸醒的，經過的事情他都理會。但有一部分人則完全惘然，甚至有人預備給他埋葬他也毫不感動。</p>
<p>總之，類癎不是疾病，却是疾病的終止，是造化的療治法則。對待患類癎者，應完全避免慌張與驚動，多用積極的暗示，靜候造化的療治法則的完成。</p>
<h3 id="c180">告提議廢除醫師信條者 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>醫師信條，為余所創擬，而經上海醫師公會二十年度春季大會所通過者也。頒布以來，於茲四載，雖不敢謂全滬會員悉能恪守，然而各地醫團相起仿效，公然反對，尙尠其人。近乃有提議廢除者，誠怪事也。若曰：陳義腐化，違反潮流耶？則新文化之建設，方且以舊道德為中心，新生活之施行，亦以禮義廉恥為大本，政府之三令五申，固已昭昭在人耳目，蚓信余之所列，雖側重於醫德之提高，而實無碍於醫界之進步，雖植基於中國之倫理，而實借鏡於歐美醫界之情形。吾國今日之醫界，尙在步束西諸醫學先進國家後塵之時，人能行而我不能行，非自　目棄而何？非違反潮流而何？若曰：紙上空談，無補事實耶？則信條云者本與法律殊科，以法律之尊嚴，尙不能禁大奸巨　之作惡，蚓夫一團體共守之契的耶？然信條頒布以後，前此醫界混亂之現象，墮落之情形，究已日趨减少，除非會員之江湖醫生外，會員醫師中之公然登誇大廣吿於報紙，行欺詐手段於病人者，究少其人，則信條之施行，又不得謂之絕無小補也。原夫信條之製訂，其用有三；一在防止同道間非道義之競爭，一在减少醫病間無謂之紛擾，一在增加社員對於醫界信仰之心理，今之提議廢除者共意若曰：信條之的束太甚，營業之發展有妨，不知醫旣為業，當有力謀發展之可能，特發展之途徑有正當與吾之分耳！提高吾之道德，增進吾之技能；成效旣著，聲譽自彰；人格旣高，信仰自衆；雖欲其不發展不可得也。此與信條乎何妨？若不取正當之手段，而一味以誇大巧取為能事，則雖可欺人於一時，豈能逃識者之鄙視？雖可避同道之制裁，又豈能得社會之信仰？迨至令譽旣摧毀無餘，營業亦一落千丈，甚者因一人之故，而使全體醫師之名譽减低，則雖無信條，又安在其能發展也。余草此文，非徒吿提議者，亦將使吿同道知所取舍云爾！</p>

<p>鱗屑性眼臉緣炎患者的眼臉緣。大都充血腫脤。牠的上面。發生稍呈黃色的痂皮。這種痂皮常常乾燥。而成鱗屑狀。所以本症特稱為鱗屑性眼瞼緣炎。或者稍帶濕潤。本症所生的痂皮。如若一旦除去後。牠的皮膚，並不形成潰瘍。這是與潰瘍性眼瞼緣炎區別的地方。</p>
<p>潰瘍性眼臉緣炎本症又名化膿性眼臉緣炎。多由鱗屑性眼瞼綠炎經久不治。增劇而成化膿。此時患者的眼瞼緣。充血腫脹。睫毛的周圍。發生痂皮。若將痂皮除去。則見毛根處形成潰瘍。且易出血。或者並無痂皮。而於毛根處發現黃色的膿點。本症常可引起睫毛亂生症及睫毛禿。</p>
<p>眥部眼瞼緣炎於外眥部（就是外眼角）的眼瞼緣皮膚。發赤糜爛。中央呈灰白色。往往同時合併結膜炎，眼瞼濕疹，及口角，口唇，或鼻孔等處的糜爛</p>
<p>眼瞼綠炎雖可治愈。但易再發。切宜注意。牠的治療。就是設法去其痂皮。治共潰瘍。或塗軟膏。或點藥液。至若腺病體質的小兒。則更宜內服砒鐵劑及魚肝油。奏效當可更速。</p>

<p>— 周夢白</p>
<p>（十三）紅花除虫菊Chrysanthemum　roseum　Web　et　Mhar</p>
<p>（植物）為波斯Persia原產，各地均可培養，多年草也。全株類似除虫菊，惟莖葉無毛，葉之裂片更深。開紅色舌狀周化。</p>
<p>（成分）與除蟲菊同。惟Pyrethrin含量稍少。</p>
<p>（用途）本種較除虫菊强健，病虫之害較少，唯收花量少，殺虫力及製品色澤低劣，鮮有作殺虫粉原料而栽培者。僅有花圃種植以作觀賞用。上海各花店均有出售。</p>
<p>（十四）艾Artemisia　vhlgaris　L．var．Indica，Maxim．Beifuss（德）Mugwort（英）</p>
<p>（植物）自生於山野，多年草也。莖高的一公尺。葉有柄，互生，一—二回羽狀中裂，裂片作長橢圓形，鈍頭，反面密布白毛。頂生穗狀花序，夏秋之候，開淡褐色之小頭狀花。果實瘦小，缺冠毛。</p>
<p>（生藥）艾葉Folium　Artemisiae　Vulgaris採集艾之葉片乾燥而成。葉為一—二回羽狀中裂，裂片作長橢圓形，鈍頭，反面密布白毛。本品味苦，有特異之芳香性。</p>
<p>市間之艾葉，係採集其莖葉製成，非良品也。</p>
<p>（成分）葉中含有的0.02％之精油，其主要成分為Cineol（50％）。</p>
<p>（藥理）艾葉有解熱之效，試以家兎服艾葉之蒸溜液，在適當分量之內，則呈顯明之體溫下降現象。倘給以超過其解熱之必要量或致死量，則不能供醫術上作解熱藥之用。</p>
<p>（藥用）舊方：艾藥治腹痛，吐瀉等有效。又子宮出血，刀創等，作煎劑用，有止血之效。更有製成熟艾，作點炙用者。</p>
<p>熟艾，以艾葉於陽下曝乾，搗為粉末，去其渣滓，而以殘留之白色毛茸製成。以艾茸製成艾炷，醬者用以炙病。又以之作印泥及置於墨盒中作貯藏墨汁之用。俗以陰曆五月五日所採之葉為最佳。</p>
<p>民問：將艾葉乾燥，可代烟葉用，並有止喘之效。又常作解熱藥之用。新鮮艾葉，揉出液汁，塗於布上，蟲蛇刺傷，敷之有效。</p>
<p>（十五）艾片Blumea　balsamifera，DC．</p>
<p>（植物）為自生之多年草。全株密生褐色之粗毛，葉有柄，革質，披針形，鋸齒緣，兩面有毛。頂生圓錐花序，開黃色之頭狀花。果實作微小之圓柱形。</p>
<p>（生藥）艾片（又名艾納香）Camphora　Blumeae以本植物用水蒸氣蒸溜所得之精油中取得。本品為白色或淡黃色之脆弱結晶塊，破面帶玻璃光澤。不純凈者含有帶汚之黃白色植物破片。本品殆由純粹之左旋龍腦而成，有特有之佳香。</p>
<p>（產地）廣東產量最多。</p>
<p>（成分）莖葉中含有。0.2—1.88％之精由，共主要成分為左旋龍腦L．Borneol。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c183">牙齒常識問答（十八） <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>第三節　齒槽膿漏症</p>
<p>（第九八間）蛀蝕腐爛的牙齒，除了妨礙咀嚼外，還有什麽害處？</p>
<p>（答）腐蛀的牙齒，不光是無用，而且還有很大的害處。牠的蛀洞裏，滿藏着汚垢微生菌和已經腐敗的食物。就是時常洗刷，也難除去。無論爾所食的物，如　淸潔衛生，但是一入口腔，經過咀嚼，與這些微菌汚物等混和，還能保持本來的淸潔嗎？很多的胃腸炎都是因為常食這種混有毒質微菌的食物所致。</p>
<p>（第九九問）什麽呌做口腔傳染灶？</p>
<p>（答）傳染病灶的意義，大概可以說是一種局部的病患（局部的瘡傷等），牠的毒素，能够傳佈到身體的各部，惹起他部的疾病，譬方像肺裏邊發生結核瘡傷，牠的毒素，就會散佈到全身，惹起各種病症，這就可算是肺部的傳染病灶。若是口腔裏發生這種病灶，就呌做口腔傳染病灶。</p>
<p>（第一百問）口腔傳染病灶，那種最為可慮？</p>
<p>（答）要算牙患中的齒糟膿瘡（卽傳染性牙根膜炎），允共是慢性齒槽膿瘡，和齒槽膿漏症兩種。前面已經說過，這兩種病症日常所釀造的膿汁，或者可以說是膿菌所產生的毒素，會被血液吸收，或嚥下去在胃腸吸收，由血管運輸到身體的各部，發生種種炎症。若是上攻，能够犯眼犯腦，發生眼球炎腦膜炎等。若是入心或入肺，就會發生心臟或肺腑的炎症。若是犯消化器官，則發為喉炎，胃腸炎，胃腸潰瘍等症。凡遇身體虛弱的時候，或某部器官抵抗力薄弱的塲所，都是這毒素肆虐的機會。但尋常以關節炎及胃腸病為最多。</p>
<p>（第一零一問）口腔傳染病灶所引起的疾病，治療上有什麼困難？</p>
<p>（答）最大的困難，就是不知病源的所在。因為病雖發於他處，病源却在口腔。而且這種口腔裏的病，因為多是慢性沒有劇烈的症候，患者多不注意牠，有的人竟不知牠的存在。而一般粗心的或是沒有經騐的醫生們，只管頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，絕不顧到口腔裏的病源。所以往往有經年累月，百藥罔効，弄得虛弱不堪，一旦遇着名醫，找出病源，把口腔疾病治愈，其他炎症，自然消退，恢復健康的。</p>

<p>昨日粉市、各月一致呈猛跳之象洋　報價逐步雖微小四八分左右不等、惟市場人心、以公債改革實行、一般人未免又多推想而國內存底、如無洋麦接濟、據業中沽計在新麦以前恐有不足之慮、是以買蓬勃、近期步步直上、六七月份新粉、因廠出不豊、亦同趨好勢、迨于下午開盤、以外行帮仍有吸收、內地實銷、亦因新年略動、致本月份更見硬化、六七月份究屬新粉、漲度較弱、結果計近期漲六分左右、遠期漲二分左右云、</p>

<h3 id="c204">從人力車計程錶說起 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 忻炘</p>
<p>不久之前，我們在報端會觀到過一則一位工友發明年月日時辰鐘的新聞過，那隻鐘能夠循着齒輪的轉動，指出年月日和時辰來。</p>
<p>現在我們又看到了一則一位工友發明人力車計程定價錶的新聞了，據說「該錶如裝置於人力車上後，卽能循輸轂之旋轉，計指里程及車資代價，毫髮不爽」。而更巧的，是發明此錶的應雲麒君，也是「係一工匠，不甚讀書」。因之「有此發明」？更覺得「彌足難能」。</p>
<p>年月日時辰鐘和人力車計程定價錶的發明，在科學發達如現時代，固然並不是怎樣了不起的事情，但是這發明是出之於科學落後的現中國，並且該發明者又都是「不甚讀書」的「工匠」，則我們除「彌足難能」的驚嘆外，實在更不能不致欽佩之忱。</p>
<p>和上兩則新聞相反的，我們可以舉「家均富有」，且為「大學生」的謝起鳳，盧星炫，蔣明俠三人為盜；及前淸相國李鴻章之曾孫，十五歲童子李道紃，每年揮霍二三萬元之鉅來做倒子。從上面極顯明的對照中，我們可以看出：小有產者在這資本主義社會沒落期中，是怎樣的沉湎於現社會的享樂；封建社會遺留下來的官僚家庭的孩子，叉是怎樣嬌生慣養，祗知揮霍；而担負了時代的巨任的「不甚讀書」的工人階級們，却是在困苦艱難的環境中依舊對社會有所建樹</p>
<p>在去年，社會主義的蘇聯曾經有過一决非常熱烈的斯達哈諾夫運動，（按：斯達哈諾夫運動的由來，是因為一九三五年八月十二日，在頓涅决煤區依來閔諾礦礦工斯達哈諾夫用一氣鎚，在一班時間內，鑿煤一〇二噸，佔全礦每班產量十分之一，打破全世界產煤量的紀錄）。從這次運動以後蘇聯全國各工業區，每天皆有各種新紀錄發現，到處皆在努力提高技術的水準，增加勞動的生產率」。</p>
<p>回顧我們中國，人力車計程錶和斯達哈諾夫的氣鎚的功能，固然相差很遠，然而他所遭遇到的待遇，则是可說是更遠的，一個有轟轟烈烈熱閙非凡的作為「工業革命」的運動大會，而一個則是：「呈悉茲塡發該呈請人所製人力車計程定價錶專利證書一紙，仰卽領收具報，至前繳銀八十元，除扣應繳專利證書給予費四十元，及印花費二元外，餘銀三十八元，及審查决定書附發，此批」。我不相信同是一樣發明，其所遭遇到的冷淡和熱烈，竟有這樣的分別，允共是我們天天喊建設，天天喊科學落後的中國，竟有這樣的冷淡對付發明者的情理，而這發明者還是一個「不甚讀書」的「工匠」。</p>
<p>我們中國雖然也很不少如蘇俄聯邦似的「靑苗」，但是「陽光」可實在有未免太淡薄之感，因之，「其蓬勃之氣」，也就不能如人家那樣的「實在找不着恰當的名字來形容」，而日見其枯委。</p>

<p>— 葉萊</p>
<p>不高的身材，一副精靈的眼珠子，一張平正的臉孔，黃家興皺着眉頭的啣着烟斗，一拐一拐的從家裏到他的公司管領下的「番攤館」裏去。賭徒們正好像沒有了知覺似的沉着腦袋的國着那長方形的檯子。裏面的淡黃的燈光疲乏地罩籠着疲乏而同時又是緊張的人們的臉孔，從一些人們的嘴巴裏噴出來的灰白色的烟圈子一個一個的，由濃厚而漸漸地散開得那麽淡薄的，充滿了看不見室外的太陽的世界裏，越顯得是一張迷糊，那一股一股的充滿了汗的奐味的窒息，使他的煩惱的心裏感到一種更難過的氣味了。</p>
<p>透了一口氣的，路上了盆子似的樓台上，眼珠子又是慣例地望了一望裏面的人們，和他合股創辦番攤公司的黃阿均正沉着腦袋的瞪着下面，好像沒有看到黃家興已來到似的！</p>
<p>「眞……」還沒有說出來就嘆了一口氣的，在後邊的黃家興却煩惱地踱來踱去，輕微的太息的聲音使黃阿均不能不地轉過頭來望了一望：</p>
<p>「喂！老興，怎麽辦？這一决投機的事業又失敗了，市面的債券跌得眞利害，聽說又有什麽戰事發生了，雖然，我們在南方，就好像在溫暖的太平世界裏一樣，受不到什麽鬼子的，砲火的侵攻，可是，你和我一樣曉得的，這是整個動盪，我們的金融界也跟着起了浪花啦」。</p>
<p>阿均停了下來，拼命地抽了一口姻，皺着眉頭的望若他說：</p>
<p>「我的姪子吿訴我，他說這也是經濟恐慌的最厲害的一年，你想着，一家銀行倒閉，又是一家，我們學生的錢都差不多給廣東銀行喫光啦，還有，我們放出去的債，從沒有法兒收得到五成，你想，華僑的匯欵短少得這樣利厲，我們的十家攤鋪也變成五家了，還有，你看，現在有誰一子下賭到三五百塊錢的「你看下來的人最多不過十塊八塊眞是年頭倒運，倒到我們的頭上來了，老興，我們該怎麼辦，這許多不淸的賬目」？</p>
<p>說着，阿均沉默了下來黃家興好像被一盆冷冰的水撥在頭上一樣，他的心裏充滿了莫火的交鳴鬥爭，咒詛，私議，他的眉目皺着的想：</p>
<p>「眞倒霉，這决又損失了五千」，他想了一想，又埋怨到黃阿均的身上：「都是他弄到這個田地，不是他，我總不會跌到這個泥沼裏，可不是嗎？他收了錢，一個人私自的去虧空，在外面拖了無數的債項，差不多公司已不成為公司了，好吧，就這樣完結了吧，再撈下去有什麼用？」</p>
<p>他想着，覺得在自己的身上的存欽還有三萬多，淸算起來，他總可以說阿均自己已挪用了兩三萬，他决不會再輕易地把錢放出來攤分的。所以，他很不滿意地說着：</p>
<p>「老均，我們這樣下去，實在不可能了，我們非要趕着的把這公司關了門不可了。你想，我們現在沒有進賬而只是出賬，你也不會怪我，過去，你把進賬的錢都自己虧光，我們的公司已弄得不像樣子，就是繼續的樣下去也沒有什麽用處，賭客少了，而且，華僑的匯欽也，少到簡直沒有的歸來的華僑總是窮困的，失業的，不像十年八年以前，華僑的錢多得隨便地在賭塲里扔掉，現在，一個銅錢都變成他們的生命似的重視着，到這里來的賭徙都是空空的袋子了，眞要命，所以……」</p>
<p>他搖着頭，那濃密的長睫毛閉得只有一條蓬的機警地望着黃阿均在，他那正破着的眉頭上探察着。阿均也搖了一下頭：（未完）</p>

<p>— （葉西園）</p>
<p>千葉釀造事業的歷史也有三百多年了；當德川幕府時代中頃，此地的醬油釀造業已經很為蓬勃；聲譽及於日本全國了。如果我們展開日本的地圖來看，我們就可以看到千葉如何是一個最適宜於醬油釀造的地方。千葉位於東京灣的東北，三面臨海，束面是在在的太平洋；江户川及利根川流注共間。氣候在春夏之際比較濕潮，是最適宜於造醬的。江户川及利根川的水，當然更增加了千葉醬油的盛名，如我國紹興的黃酒一樣。在德川時代，在此地從事於醬油釀造的何北有幾十家。也許因為取水的關係，千葉的醬油釀造業又集中在兩個所在；　在千葉上方的，野田　在千葉東北境利根川出口處的銚子。在上方的野田候谷間潺潺的流水都注入那在東京灣出口的江户川的。在幕府時代，這些千葉的醬油釀造者襲用了他們相傳的技藝，很恬靜的繼承着他們的傳統事業，一直到了十九世紀的中葉。</p>
<p>明治維新的結果，不但使日本改變了它政治的生命，最重要的怕還是維新以後日本產業的發展。工廠制度，生產機械化以及以現代企業的姿態而實行着的大量生產，實予日本以强有力的經濟活動，足為她維新後的政治軍事的基礎。這是這種新經濟生命的活躍，才是最近日本政治軍事活動的原動力。隨着一般產業的現代化，在日本有着悠久歷史的醬油釀造業也以現代企業大量生產的姿態出現了，一變它原有的「亞細亞的」形態。在千葉的多數醬油釀造業須聯合起來成為幾個現代的釀造公司以集中其力量。在野田的八家醬油釀造業者首先於大正六年合併成立了野田醬油株式會社，又於大正十四年合併了流山萬上味淋會社及朝鮮仁川日本醬油會社一躍而為日本規校最宏首屈一指的野田醬油株式會社。在姚子方面也產生了　　　醬　株式會社，足與野田相頡頏，共後又有銚子醬油株式會社的成立，合野田，及　　　而成為日本醬釀造業的三雄。</p>

<p>月下女郎</p>
<p>月高高，雲稀稀，風蕭蕭，柳細細，小石橋畔，綠茵滿地，穿過竹林，走過小溪，有一個女郞；孤單單獨處桐蔭里，若有所思，若有所憶，喃喃自語，對着皓月空嘆息。虫不叫，犬不吠，花不開，烏不啼，更使她愁悵在心扉；掩面流淚，莫非是爸不歡喜？莫非是娘不愛你？誰和你胡鬧？誰和你淘氣？別嘆息，別流淚，再不要怏怏不樂，別誤了你的青春時　，努力！努力！</p>
<p>月明明，山低低，草靑靑，虫唧唧，一葉扁舟，橫渡河里，搖過石舫，穿過橋基，有一個女郞；孤單單獨處小舟里，若有所思，若有所憶，深深思想，對着明月訴衷情。夜深長，夢無頭，歌未罷，月已西，史使她焦急在心意；放聲悲啼，莫非是受誰的氣？莫非是失了情侶？誰和你取笑？誰和你頑皮？別嘆息，別悲泣，再不</p>

<p>赴京考試到蒲東。烏鴉幾陣夕陽紅。倉卒欲尋投宿處。恨無樵子問途窮。小琴童，肩挑書筐匆匆走。忽聽得，林間隱隱一聲鐘。張相公，解愁懷步入普救寺。禮拜和尚小法聰。佛殿虔誠來頂禮。焚香默佑運來通。京試三塲皆中式。願朱衣暗點狀元公。那時節，大雄寳殿重金珠。莊嚴佛像盡威風。拜罷一番游佛殿。固然是花木禪房曲徑通。驀然間，環佩釘璫來內院。俏佳人，淡掃娥眉春色融。娉婷素如神仙態。窄窄金蓮步轉空。好丯姿宛是許飛瓊。聞道是，蒲東相國千金女。心有靈犀一點通。臨去秋波那一轉。魂靈兒早已上天空。張相公心生一個牢籠計。借僧房僻靜把書攻。幸虧方丈偏知趣。天然撮合美嬌容。一生艷福樂無窮。</p>

<p>大上海最近開映的「呼風喚雨」之前有兩張短片，一是「海底水族生活」，一是「都夜曲」。前者實地攝製海底動物的生活，十分生動。不久以前看到過一張昆蟲生活的短片；關於附映這種短片，一方面果然是正片不足一百二十分鐘的補足，另一方面比較從前專門附映胡鬧滑稽短片有意義得多。但是我們的國產片，不但一定要凑足兩小時候，有　　還不必要的拼命拉長，否則好像要對不起觀衆所付的代價似的，要附映這種比較有意義的短片自然更談不到。</p>
<p>至於卡通片亦然，希望卡通唯一製作者萬氏昆仲努力！</p>

After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, he gave a brief report entitled "Loyalty and Filial Piety as the Foundation of the Nation". The meeting adjourned at 10:30 AM. (3rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing - In his report at the National Government memorial week meeting on the morning of the 3rd, Chairman Lin first cited the sixth lecture of Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s Three Principles of the People, in which the Premier stated, "We must first restore our inherent old morality, and then can we plan to restore our inherent national status." and "China's inherent morals are first loyalty and filial piety, then benevolence and love, then trustworthiness and righteousness, and then peace." He explained the meaning of "loyalty" and "filial piety" in great detail. He said, "Loyalty", in terms of one's own work, is being loyal to one's work, loyal to one's duty, loyal to one's calling, or loyal to one's principles. In terms of the other party's status, it is also being loyal to people, loyal to leaders, loyal to organizations, or loyal to society and the nation. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that those who know first are responsible for invention, those who know later are responsible for advocacy, and those who do not know are responsible for implementation. This principle of division of labor and cooperation, each fulfilling one's own duty, requires a word of loyalty to maintain its belief and exert its heart and mind. Speaking of "filial piety," the Premier said that China is particularly good at filial piety. Even the most civilized countries in the world do not talk about it as completely as China does. China talks about filial piety, starting from cultivating oneself and governing affairs, to establishing oneself in society and protecting the country and defending the people. A person's entire life is included in filial piety. It is profound and extensive, unprecedented. The ancients said, "It is rare for one who is filial and fraternal to be fond of offending superiors and causing rebellion." Therefore, filial piety is also the foundation of loyalty. In the family, they are good children, and in society, they are good citizens. Therefore, ancient monarchs often governed the world with filial piety. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that within the Republic of China, if the people can bring the two words of loyalty and filial piety to the extreme, the country can naturally become strong. He also said that filial piety is the initial basis for being a person, and loyalty is the great cause of governing the country. Loyalty and filial piety are inherent morals in China and are also inherent in human nature. If we want to restore our national status and unite to form a national group, we must first restore the old morals of loyalty and filial piety. He further stated that with loyalty and filial piety, there is genuine emotion and true nature of "humanity." Now, the Communist Party values ​​material things and despises human nature. This fallacy that does not conform to national character is enough to disrupt the country and destroy morality. In conclusion, he said that if we want to restore old morals, we must develop human nature, promote loyalty and filial piety, and recognize that loyalty and filial piety are the foundation of the nation, the Three Principles of the People can be realized, and the revolution can be successful.

<h3 id="e3">Wei and Chen Express Joint Opinions on Public Bonds <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing - Although the bondholders' association has declared and stated its general outline of the situation regarding Finance Minister Kong's discussions with the Shanghai financial community on the issuance of unified reconstruction bonds, the detailed methods are still awaiting government approval. The Executive Yuan's routine meeting on the 4th may raise this matter for discussion. According to the joint opinions expressed by financial experts Heng Tingsheng and Chen Changheng on this matter, the issuance of unified public bonds to collect and exchange more than 30 different types of bonds and certificates with different names and terms is considered a very appropriate method. However, in the future, we should take this opportunity for reorganization and focus on improving the following matters: After banks underwrite public bonds, they should vigorously promote them to the public to absorb private funds; futures trading in public bonds should be absolutely prohibited to stabilize the bond market and prevent speculation; interest rates on public bonds should be appropriately restricted to avoid government losses.

The main points of these regulations are as follows: 1. The temporary permission for the existence of handmade cigarettes is purely for the sake of the livelihood of the poor, but there are many ways to make a living in society, and it cannot be considered that handmade cigarettes are their only way to survive. Handmade cigarette households in various places are accustomed to evading taxes, which is not a legitimate business, and should stop and re-register in order to thoroughly clean up. 2. The registered cigarette households in various places will be limited to four phases, and the unified tax authorities will use a lottery method to cancel their registration, with four months as one phase, starting from January 1 this year to the end of April next year, and drawing lots in phases. Each cigarette household has this appropriate time to change careers at ease. 3. The method of official paper sales is implemented. Within the time limit, cigarette households that have not been drawn to cancel their registration are allowed to purchase and receive official paper to continue making cigarettes, but the price of official paper is increased, and the tax silver to be collected is included in the paper price. After purchasing official paper, cigarette households will issue special sales permits according to the number of cigarettes to be produced for identification. In addition, no more tax forms will be collected. Those who do not purchase official paper to make cigarettes or do not affix special sales permits will be regarded as tax evasion and will be fined. If there are private production of cigarettes without registration or after cancellation of registration, they will be punished in accordance with the inspection and punishment chapters of machine-made cigarettes. 4. The separate tax collection methods for handmade cigarettes in various provinces and regions previously stipulated by the Ministry of Finance are all abolished. (3rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing - The Capital District Court continued its inquiry on the morning of the 3rd into the case of Du Jiasheng, former prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Court, and Yang Cenggu, chief clerk, who were accused of malfeasance and soliciting bribes. The plaintiff, Huang Yintang, was absent due to illness. Du Jiasheng still denied accepting a bribe of 6,000 yuan at the Liangxi Hotel. Yang Cenggu testified that he had never been to the Liangxi Hotel and denied soliciting bribes. The prosecutor argued that there were several points that could prove the facts of the case: 1. Huang Yintang's account of the payment of money and the location layout were completely consistent after an investigation in Shanghai; 2. The appraisal report copied by Yang Cenggu was consistent with his handwriting; 3. The case file of Zhu Alan handled by Du Jiasheng was reviewed by courts across the country, and his handling procedures were not in compliance. The use of detention as a means shows that what the defendant did was true and should be handled according to law. After the defendant's lawyer began to debate, the court ruled that the debate in this case was concluded and that sentencing would be on the 8th. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e33">Children's Reading Material Exhibition <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>From the 30th of last month to the 5th of this month, the "National Children's Year Implementation Committee" is holding a "Children's Reading Material Exhibition" in Nanjing. After the exhibition period, the collected materials will be exhibited on tour in various important local committees across the country. The committee announces its three objectives: To provide the people of the country with a general overview to correct their perceptions of children's reading materials; to provide experts with research to aid in improving and selecting children's reading materials; and to provide the literary world with references, hoping that both new and old writers will dedicate themselves to the compilation and writing of children's reading materials. Since the opening of the Children's Year at the beginning of August last year, half a year has passed, but the implementation methods planned at that time seem to lack concrete achievements. The methods of this conference are practical and the objectives are concise. If it can awaken the people of the country to a correct understanding and improve the content and form of children's reading materials, then just this one action will be sufficient to prove that the Children's Year is not a mere formality.</p>
<p>In August of last year, we published a commentary entitled "Children's Year and Children's Reading Materials," the main idea of which was that children's reading materials are the spiritual food of children, but the existing children's reading materials have failed to fully satisfy people's expectations. The conclusion was a wish for publishers and writers to "quickly eliminate the inferior and temporarily retain the better ones" and then start from scratch to create excellent works. This is certainly not something that can be done hastily. When more excellent works gradually appear, even the relatively better ones of today should be eliminated, so that children can have spiritual food of pure quality. We still hold this view and hope that those attending the exhibition will adopt it and turn it into public opinion. Publishers and writers should receive broad expectations. Those who procrastinate should no longer procrastinate, and those who hesitate should become motivated. Since there is demand, there will naturally be supply. The garden of children's reading materials will likely have a rich harvest.</p>
<p>The exhibition has collected 2,450 children's reading materials, totaling 12,498 volumes. Judging from the quantity, it cannot be said to be small. For this large quantity of children's reading materials, the committee has hired experts to form a judging committee to conduct research and evaluation one by one. According to recent telegrams, the experts have determined the evaluation criteria at the results of their meetings. What we hope for from the judging committee is, first, to recognize the position of modern Chinese children. Everyone involved in education knows that children are not miniature adults. Therefore, although the education and perceptions of adults may not be entirely unsuitable for children, they cannot simply be transferred. They must start from the position of children to be considered pure children's reading materials. Furthermore, modern China is currently suffering from unprecedented difficulties, and the Chinese masses bear the heavy responsibility of striving for national liberation. This heavy responsibility will certainly not stop with one generation but will be passed down from father to son. Therefore, the reading materials for modern Chinese children must also take this point into serious consideration to be considered reading materials suitable for the times. Second, they should have clear vision and a fair attitude. The work of criticism is very difficult, because in the literary world, it is often believed that critics either scold or praise. In fact, this view is quite wrong. Pure criticism uses standards to measure works, with no room for gratitude or resentment, so how can there be talk of scolding or praising? The current evaluation of children's reading materials is similar to literary criticism. The experts all possess knowledge and should not favor their own preferences or cling to established ideas. If they wholeheartedly focus on children and are concerned about the nation and the country, they will naturally be able to issue appropriate judgments based on their wisdom. All excellent reading materials must be solemnly recognized and disseminated to children nationwide, while inferior and unacceptable reading materials must be specifically pointed out so that children nationwide will not be harmed by them again. The business of publishers is a small matter, but the appropriate spiritual food for children is a very large matter.</p>
<p>There is another matter. Currently, some advocate for revising existing textbooks to accommodate the special circumstances of a particular region. After studying the textbooks, the judging committee should solemnly declare whether this move is acceptable or detrimental to the spirit of education in our country. In our opinion, revision is necessary, but for the parts that they believe should be revised, we not only advocate that they should absolutely not be revised, but also that their proportion should be increased and their content enriched.</p>

<p>Moscow: Today, we received a report from the headquarters of the Soviet Russian Far East Army that another conflict has occurred between Russian and "Manchu" troops. Two companies of "Manchu" soldiers approached the border on November 1st and then sent reconnaissance teams into Russian territory. They were repelled by border guards opening fire. Later, one "Manchu" soldier was found dead from a bullet. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Harbin: According to observers with good sources here, although it is rumored that regular Soviet Russian soldiers participated in the conflict between Japanese troops and "Manchukuo" rebels, the situation is not likely to deteriorate unless the Soviet Russian side takes retaliatory action. Currently, those in charge on the Japanese side are closely monitoring the development of the situation and also hope to resolve this dispute locally. (National Telegram on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Changchun: According to semi-official sources, the Kwantung Army and the "Manchukuo" authorities have decided to make the border conflict a local issue and prevent the situation against Russia from becoming more serious. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Harbin: Since the continuous armed conflicts between the Mongolian puppet regime and Japan and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has been further preparing for the defense of the Far East. Currently, Soviet military engineers are building fortifications day and night to complete the solid defense line on the Russian-Manchu border, starting from near Vladivostok and reaching Jagaer, a defense line of 1,000 miles, densely packed with anti-aircraft guns and other heavy artillery, trenches, and tunnels. Four miles away from the first line of defense, there is a second line of defense, densely packed with tank units. The defense project in Bulagos, which has the nickname of Verdun in the Far East, to Aiginsk is guaranteed to be solid. The Soviet Union is also planning to complete the railway plan in the Far East, such as the 630 miles from Fornyudinsk to Kulun, the 1,250 miles from Baratinsky to Uriesutai, and other shorter lines, which are gradually being completed, enough to counter the highways and railways built by the Japanese army in Manchuria and Rehe. Although the Soviet Union has given up the Chinese Eastern Railway, it does not hinder the connection in the Far East, and the military defense is extremely thorough.

<p>Tokyo: The Economic Research Committee announced data on digesting government bonds, the main points of which are: the recent state of government bond digestion is sluggish. The reason for this is the reduction in surplus investment and the need for funds in the industrial sector. Another reason is that when people invest in securities, many purchase foreign securities with higher interest rates. What should be paid attention to is the outflow of funds abroad, which is allowed to be investment in Manchuria. Since Showa 7 (1932), Japan has invested 800 million yuan in Manchuria within four years, and exports to Manchuria have exceeded the total amount by 570 million yuan, which can be offset by the amount of capital investment. However, the amount of investment in Manchuria will increase in the future. If the number of surplus exports cannot be offset, then investment in Manchuria will put pressure on the national financial market of Japan. Therefore, the smooth digestion of government bonds is a problem that should be given importance. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e37">Soviet Russian Far East Army Headquarters Accuses Japanese Army of Spreading Rumors, To Conceal the Truth of the Puppet State's Mutiny <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Moscow: The Far East Red Army Headquarters made the following report to the TASS reporter on February 2nd: "Today we received a report that the headquarters of the Japanese Kwantung Army issued a notice stating that the 65th Manchurian Infantry Regiment crossed into the Soviet border, which was provoked by the Soviet Union, and decided to describe the conflict within the Soviet Union on January 30th (this conflict was the result of the Japanese-Manchu army invading the Soviet Union) as a mutiny by the Manchurian army within Manchurian territory and the suppression by the Japanese-Manchu army. In this conflict, many rebels were killed or injured, and one Soviet soldier was among them."</p>
<p>The Far East Army Headquarters declared, "The above two notices from the Kwantung Army Headquarters are completely fabricated, and their purpose is to deceive the public, conceal the truth of the Manchurian mutiny, and defend the provocations of the Japanese-Manchu army against the Soviet border. The Far East Army Headquarters has fully verified that the TASS report in Botili on January 29 regarding the Manchurian army crossing into Soviet territory and the report on January 30 regarding the Japanese-Manchu army attacking the Soviet border are completely correct." The Far East Army Headquarters specifically confirmed that the Manchurian army was disarmed as soon as it crossed into Soviet territory and was sent to Voroshilov City in Soviet territory to prevent them from clashing with the Japanese-Manchu army. The entire world (including the Kwantung Army Headquarters) knows that Soviet officers faithfully abide by the guidance of the Soviet government, resolutely promote the policy of peace, closely observe their international obligations, and it is completely impossible for the Soviet army to invade other countries.</p>
<p>"As for the claim that Soviet officers placed the cross-border army on the border, it is also obviously unfounded. Moreover, according to their notice, the Manchurian mutiny was provoked by the Soviet Union, so it can only be ridiculed by those who are familiar with the attitude of the Chinese people and the Manchurian local army towards Japan. The value of such notices and their complete inconsistency with the facts can be seen in the following facts, that is, Japanese officers initially claimed that the report of the Manchurian army fleeing into Soviet territory was fabricated to achieve their propaganda purposes," he said.</p>
<p>In addition, TASS reported on January 30 that January 30 was the day when the Japanese-Manchu army invaded the Soviet Union and was repelled by the Soviet border guards. Later, the Kwantung Army Headquarters reported that after the incident, at the point of the conflict 1.5 kilometers from the border within Soviet territory, two Japanese rifles, 120 rounds of ammunition, one Japanese hand grenade, many shell casings, one set of Japanese military uniforms, one Japanese steel helmet, and machine gun accessories were found. These exhibits are all sealed and preserved by the Far East Army Headquarters. In this conflict, the Japanese-Manchu army killed three Soviet border soldiers and injured seven, and one Red Army soldier went missing, which is obviously what the Kwantung Army Headquarters called "killing a Soviet soldier," and was obviously captured by the Japanese-Manchu army who invaded Soviet territory on January 30. The Far East Army Headquarters also said that at noon on February 1, the Japanese-Manchu army again attempted to invade the Soviet border at the same place. Two teams of Japanese-Manchu troops approached the border and stationed, and then sent a small team to invade Soviet territory, which was driven back by Soviet border guards, leaving a dead body in Soviet territory. It is obvious that one of the goals of the provocations of the Japanese puppet army is to force the return of the Manchurian mutineers, and the other purpose is to capture a living or dead Red Army soldier at any cost as evidence. The Soviet people and the Far East Army Headquarters are familiar with these provocative purposes of the Japanese-Manchu authorities and the Kwantung Army Headquarters. Since 1931 to 1932, their rumors about the Far East Army have been well known. For example, in 1932, the Army Minister Nam Jiro (now the commander of the Kwantung Army) falsely claimed that the Red Army supplied General Ma Zhanshan's anti-Japanese army with weapons, but everyone knows that the weapons of General Ma and other anti-Japanese generals were supplied by Japanese merchants in Dalian. Since then, the Kwantung Army's defamatory notices have been famous all over the world. These defamatory notices are not only seen in various border conflicts caused by the provocative acts of the Japanese-Manchu army, but have also been extended to a wide range of issues concerning the Soviet Union and its military leaders. The Far East Army Headquarters is willing to fully assist any fair committee to come to the scene to investigate the truth to determine the actual situation of the recent conflicts that occurred on the Manchurian border, and the incidents on January 29, 30, and February 1 this year.

<p>Tokyo: Japanese officials and Japanese entrepreneurs in Manchuria are now fiercely infighting, attacking each other. It is obvious that they are divided into two opposing factions: the Dalian faction and the Changchun faction. The Dalian faction belongs to the South Manchuria Railway, and the Changchun faction belongs to the Japanese officials in the puppet Manchuria who hold a rebellious attitude towards the South Manchuria Railway. The financial and economic policies of the puppet Manchuria are restrained by the South Manchuria Railway everywhere. For example, the development of the Manchurian mainland and the development of rural areas are linked to the South Manchuria Railway's freight policy. The two factions also cannot cooperate in industrial revitalization and coal policy. The actual power of Manchurian enterprises is still held by the large South Manchuria Railway Group. The puppet Manchurian state policy is controlled by it. The South Manchuria Railway under the control of Japanese financial groups advocates profit-making, while the forces controlled by the two military departments pay attention to national defense enterprises. Even the Japanese domestic financial and economic circles are hesitant to invest. The South Manchuria Railway itself is also in a difficult situation. For a time, the theory of reorganization was very popular, and it is expected that the organization will change. (Hualian Electric Report on the 3rd)</p>

<h3 id="e41">US Authorities Announce Economic War Mitigation Policy, Peaceful Distribution Replaces Physical Plunder <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull, at a time when the Italo-Ethiopian War and the Far East situation are urgent, has drafted a peaceful trade plan that would allow countries with scarce raw materials to abandon military conquest to obtain raw materials. Hull firmly believes that this method can not only enable some countries to prevent the invasion of land and maintain their so-called status quo, but also enable poor countries to meet their needs without taking risks. The reasons for modern wars are nothing more than overpopulation, lack of raw materials, and poor economic conditions. Hull and his advisors firmly believe that these problems can be resolved peacefully. Therefore, the so-called hungry countries mentioned in today's newspapers, such as Japan, Italy, and Germany, do not have to adopt military policies, and the solution lies in how to eliminate hunger, unemployment, and market problems. At the same time, the solution to these problems relies on international joint action. According to the observations of general diplomats, once the economy improves, Hull's proposed method will definitely be realized. Furthermore, if this is realized, it will not be difficult to prevent various crises in the future. According to the seven commercial agreements that Hull signed with various countries last year and the dozen or so commercial agreements currently underway, they can be said to be the initial signs of this plan. These commercial agreements have boldly cut tariffs on hundreds of commodities by as much as 50%, so that goods can flow smoothly and people can make the most of their talents. However, according to Hull and his advisors, these commercial agreements are still a preliminary step in their plan. The entirety of their plan is to open up world trade, raw materials, and markets. Recently, Hull has slightly expressed his views in the New of Fortune magazine, saying, "From 1800 to 1900, the population of Europe increased from 180 million to 460 million, and the people's lives did not suffer as a result, but became richer. This was not created by war, but by the result of the development of all industries and commerce." Therefore, Hull believes that modern countries should have a joint action to promote this function. All countries must work together to promote the flow of international trade, rebuild stable monetary relations, and at the same time establish an organization and several principles to ensure that all countries can obtain important raw materials at fair prices. Only by blocking the world's economic activities can all panic and anxiety arise. Once this psychology is produced, war is seen as a safer way out. However, in fact, war is difficult to achieve this goal. Although the winners seem to profit for a short time, hatred is buried, and the international situation is difficult to be stable for a long time. Hull's economic advisor, Fiss, also advocates that not only should raw materials be made available to those who lack them, but also those who lack industry should obtain machines to develop production. In this way, any nation can produce what it needs within its borders and purchase what it cannot supply itself. (National Telegraph on the 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e42">Naval Conference, Battleship Tonnage Issue, France and Italy Oppose the Anglo-American Big Battleship Doctrine <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>London: A representative of the Naval Conference recently made a statement to our agency's reporter, saying that the battleship tonnage issue is likely to become a reef at the Naval Conference when the technical subgroup committee meets this afternoon to discuss the basis of qualitative restrictions. The reason is that both the United Kingdom and the United States advocate maintaining the 35,000 tons stipulated in the Washington Naval Treaty, while France and Italy hold an opposing attitude, which has been very firm in recent days, and there is no hope of reaching an agreement. The agenda of the technical subgroup committee meeting this afternoon is: 1. The definition of the German "pocket battleship"; 2. How many aircraft can a battleship carry before it becomes an aircraft carrier; 3. Should the tonnage limit of battleships be based on gross tonnage or net tonnage; 4. The definition of the age of warships. (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Paris: Regarding the tonnage issue of naval battleships, the United Kingdom had previously advocated setting it at 25,000 tons. By the time the recent naval conference began to discuss the issue of qualitative restrictions, the United Kingdom changed its position, acquiescing to the United States' intention, and advocating maintaining the amount of 35,000 tons stipulated in the Washington Naval Treaty. (France and Italy advocate reducing it to 27,000 tons.) The Paris Evening News recently wrote an article commenting on this matter, raising the question, "Will France be forced to withdraw from the Naval Conference?" According to what the newspaper knows, French naval personnel are very pessimistic about the outcome of the conference, saying, "The purpose of France's participation in the Naval Conference was to reduce naval armaments. How could the situation of the conference arouse a new trend of naval competition? This kind of competition is costly and causes mental pain, which France does not want to be involved in. Therefore, France's eventual withdrawal should not be surprising." In general, the 27,000-ton battleship proposal proposed by France and Italy cannot be accepted by the United Kingdom and the United States, and France regards the 35,000-ton limit as "impractical and very ridiculous," and will naturally not accept it. Moreover, the construction cost of a 35,000-ton battleship and a 27,000-ton battleship differs by 300,000,000 francs, which is quite considerable in France, where the budget is not very wealthy.

<p>— By Louis Fisher</p>
<p>——One of the Observations on the European Situation Under the Shadow of Murderous Intentions——</p>
<p>England has once again become the center of the world. Her recovery from the economic panic has surpassed that of any other major capitalist nation. However, she still faces two million unemployed and a large number of stagnant industries. The peak of Great Britain's prosperity has finally passed. She is trying to survive on her past glory and heritage. This fundamental poverty has spurred other powers to launch an offensive against Britain's position, which the world has always considered inviolable. However, the confidence of economic recovery and the emotion caused by too many people "teasing the lion's tail" have led England to try to revitalize her power.</p>
<p>In times of prosperity, Britain helped Italy establish colonies in the Red Sea area. Today, Britain opposes Italy's invasion of the same area. This point reflects an epoch-making change in the Italian-Ethiopian affair.</p>
<p>Why is England being so honest? When Japan seized Manchuria in September 1931, London was tied up by the League of Nations and unable to move. Eden recently argued in the House of Commons that this was because "the two major neighboring countries (the United States and the Soviet Union) were not members of the League of Nations." However, this is not true, because the United States in London and Geneva has been strenuously demanding sanctions against the aggressor, and Soviet Russia has been quite willing to cooperate on this point. Britain condoned Japan's aggression in China—without stopping it—because some British quarters sympathized with Japan, because Japan's forward policy was anti-Soviet, and because Downing Street did not expect that after Manchuria there would be North China, or even Shanghai. Once an aggressive power reaches a certain momentum, it will inevitably embark on the road to war. Subsequent facts have made Britain realize this, and she has now decided to stop Italy before things escalate. It is dangerous for the world to know that the lion has turned into a kitten! On October 13th last year, during the Italian-Ethiopian war, Prime Minister Baldwin said, "One of the weaknesses of democracy is that it dares not face the truth until the last moment." This is a wonderful commentary on British democracy in 1935. Italy has pushed Britain to the last moment. If Britain is still an authoritative empire, she must prove it. Otherwise, her decline will become a certainty.</p>
<p>The truth that Mr. Baldwin's democracy dares not face is Italy's challenge to the British Empire. Fascism has turned Italy into a huge military power. Mussolini pays special attention to aerial armaments. Bombers in Augusta and the Sicilian airfields, 95 miles from Malta, could easily disable the island's batteries and shut Britain out of the Eastern Mediterranean. Moreover, the Italian troops in Libya have increased, and the Italians are showing a suspicious interest in Egypt, whose position has already been worsened by the surging nationalist (Wafd) anti-British movement. London is now beginning to face the serious threat of Mussolini concentrating 300,000 troops in East Africa. The center of the British Empire is the Nile River, and Britain is very sensitive to anything that happens in this region. In 1898, Britain and France almost went to war over the Fashoda incident in Sudan. An Italian-controlled Abyssinia could cut off the connection from Cape Town to Cairo and interrupt traffic to India. General Smuts's outcry that Britain's colored subjects might rebel added to Downing Street's inner worries. The British Empire is a colored empire, and 37 million British Africans are watching Abyssinia with keen eyes. If Mussolini destroys this last independent African nation, Britain will be blamed for arbitrary indulgence. If the "King of Kings" (the King of Abyssinia) defeats or expels the Italian army, the prestige of the white man will be swept away. Neither is a good solution, so the best way is to buy off Mussolini.</p>
<p>In short, the British government is hesitant and unable to make a decision. The final plan for Italy's conquest of Abyssinia was drawn up in the autumn of 1934. At the beginning of 1935, American consuls stationed in Mediterranean ports reported the dispatch of large armies to Eritrea. Britain naturally knew something about this. Mussolini openly said that on January 29, 1935, he told the British cabinet of his intention to conquer Abyssinia. His agreement with Laval on a compromise for the conquest of Abyssinia was concluded in early January. Well-informed Downing Street could not ignore this fact. Apparently, Britain did make some representations, because I know that on March 17th last year, the Italian government gave a written guarantee to the British government that the Abyssinian issue would never be resolved by force. However, Mussolini ultimately resorted to force.</p>
<p>An important day in European history in 1935 was March 16, when Hitler tore up the Treaty of Versailles and announced rearmament. All of Europe was shocked. On April 11, France, Britain, and Italy gathered in the small town of Stresa. Mussolini attended in person, as did Laval, MacDonald, and Simon. Italy took the opportunity in Stresa to tell British experts on the Abyssinian issue that the Blackshirt Prime Minister had decided to use force in Abyssinia. He fully saw that Britain was paying attention to Germany's new threat. His method was clever. Sure enough, the experts reported the news to Simon, but neither Simon nor MacDonald mentioned the topic to the Italian representatives. In the pre-dissolution parliamentary debates in the previous parliament, Louis George questioned Eden on this point. Eden explained that "the three major powers only agreed to collectively maintain peace within the framework of the League of Nations, but one of the three powers went to another continent to act freely and destroy the League of Nations. This is simply unimaginable." How naive! Mussolini clearly took Simon and MacDonald's silence as tacit approval and moved forward. Was Britain frightened by Germany? Or did they think that Italy would be frightened by the threat of Germany invading from Austria? Perhaps both. However, they failed to recognize the hidden forces that were pushing Italy into war.</p>
<p>On June 18, 1935, Britain and Germany concluded a naval agreement, which once again shocked the world. This repaired her fences with Germany and at the same time found out that Germany's war preparations were not yet mature. Therefore, if Italy launched another war, Britain could concentrate on Abyssinia. This made her much more stable.</p>
<p>However, the communique issued by Eden in Rome on June 24th last year after meeting with Mussolini to discuss the Anglo-German naval agreement only showed that Britain agreed to Italy's aggression. To dispel the impression of threat, Eden proposed sacrificing Abyssinia and giving Italy some land and economic concessions, while also giving Abyssinia the port of Zeila on the Red Sea and a narrow corridor through British Somaliland, in order to deepen Abyssinia's dependence on Britain. Mussolini flatly refused. He didn't want gifts, let alone trifles. "I am not a collector of deserts!" were his angry words. Now the British government understands Mussolini's intentions. Italy may have underestimated Britain's power and believed that she would always hesitate, because hesitation was a characteristic of post-war British diplomacy. This was a serious mistake on Rome's part.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Shanto Japanese Consulate Police Inspector Kakuta's Sudden Death: Kakuta Originally Suffered from Third-Stage Tuberculosis. Japanese Side Strongly Claims He Was Murdered by Chinese and Lodges a Serious Protest with Our Side. <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Japanese Consulate in Shantou has an attached police station, with many Japanese police officers and inspectors stationed there. They are often transferred between Taiwan, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Shantou, rotating to guide the Japanese and Taiwanese residents in these areas. Their responsibilities are quite significant, and their relationship with South China is also very close. However, the interior of the Japanese Consulate is very large. Office personnel who bring their families and lodge outside rent large private houses as official residences. Numbers 1 to 6, Mingde Lane, Lianhe Lane, Qilu Seashore, are all Japanese official residences, very close to the Waima Road Municipal Government area. Whenever an incident occurs, the military and police provide particularly strict protection. There is a Japanese policeman named Kakuta Susumu, from Chiba Prefecture, 36 years old, living at Number 1, Mingde Lane, serving as a police inspector, receiving a monthly salary of 120 Japanese yen. He has been working in Shantou for over three years. Every day, he goes to the Japanese Consulate at 9:00 am to work, returns home for lunch at noon, and returns to work at 1:00 pm. This is his daily routine. Kakuta usually suffers from tuberculosis, which has reached the third stage. He is mentally and physically weakened, almost at death's door. On the 21st at noon, after Kakuta returned home for lunch, he returned to the consulate to work. He had only walked forty steps out of Mingde Lane when he suddenly collapsed and died on the road. A police officer named Shi Guopan, who was standing there, saw Kakuta suddenly fall to the ground and thought he had accidentally slipped and fallen. He rushed forward to help him up, but saw that he was pale, his hands and feet twitching, and unable to speak. He thought he had suffered a stroke and needed to be treated by a doctor. He called out to nearby police officers to watch over him while Shi rushed to Mingde Lane to report to the Japanese residents there. Several Japanese came out to help Kakuta up and took him to the Bo'ai Hospital run by the Japanese nearby. Shi followed to the hospital, but was refused entry to the upper floors, so we do not know how the hospital treated him. The police officer immediately reported the whole incident to the Fifth District, which was forwarded to the Public Security Bureau for record. At around 3:00 pm, the Japanese Consul in Shantou, Harada Tadaichi, accompanied by the Japanese police chief, suddenly visited Mayor Li Yuanhe at the Municipal Government, claiming that Japanese Consulate police officer Kakuta Susumu had been ambushed by thugs on his way back to the consulate this afternoon and died of two gunshot wounds. Such incidents are the work of organized anti-Japanese extremists and can be seen as evidence of the confiscation of Japanese rice goods. He demanded that the Municipal Government strictly arrest the murderers and reserve the right to demand compensation and punish those responsible for the serious protest. Mayor Li, seeing that the matter had suddenly become serious, telegraphed the Public Security Bureau to inquire about the details and ordered the bureau to immediately send detectives to investigate the scene of the incident. As for the Japanese Consul's demands, he replied that he would respond after the case was thoroughly investigated. After the incident occurred, the Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched Detective Captain Zhuang Le and Fifth Branch Director Han Ruixiang, along with the police officer Shi Guopan who was on duty at the time, to Mingde Lane Number 1 and the scene of the incident to investigate. The Municipal Government also separately hired British doctor Jiang Shenghuoer of the Fuyin Hospital and his assistant Zheng Changshi, along with Huang Jizhi, the director of the Municipal Hospital, to go to the Bo'ai Hospital to examine the actual condition of the deceased at the time of his death. This matter was first agreed upon with the Japanese Consul Harada. The British doctors then went to the Bo'ai Hospital. However, according to the Japanese doctor's report, Kakuta had already died upon entering the hospital. Upon opening his inner garment, it was learned that the deceased had been shot, with two bullets entering his internal organs. The bullets entered between the ribs and did not exit. They had been dissected and removed. After the Japanese doctor finished speaking, he took out two small bullets and placed them on the table as evidence. However, before anyone could read them, he put the bullets away again and refused to test what kind of bullets they were. After listening to the report, the British doctor slightly examined the surface of the body and found two holes on the left arm of the corpse that looked like bullet wounds, shaped diagonally. There was also a similar small hole on the left arm, and a small hole on the back of the right side, and a healed wound on the right side (that is, the place where the bullet was taken out). Each wound had only a small amount of solidified blood. After examining the surface, the British doctor advocated dissection and chemical examination to check the exact location of the injury. The Japanese side firmly refused, and the attitude of the Japanese police chief was very poor. The British doctor said that since the Japanese side refused dissection, he could not sign a certificate proving that he died of gunshot wounds. They discussed in the hospital for a long time and then changed to using X-rays to examine the corpse. It was seen that the deceased's lungs were rotten, proving that he had suffered from third-stage tuberculosis before his death. There were still one or two other doubts, and they debated each other with academic theories. The British doctor only filled in what had been verified and did not note the cause of death. This was the actual situation on that day. The deceased believed in Buddhism, so he was placed in a pagoda-style coffin and moved to his residence at Number 1, Mingde Lane. At 3:00 pm on the 23rd, he was carried to the open space near the Qilu Airport for cremation. A spiritual memorial service was held in the Japanese Consulate. Japanese residents sent wreaths. Japanese sailors and Japanese elementary school students all lined up to pay tribute and hold the ropes. The Japanese naval band sent him to the cremation ground. The Public Security Bureau dispatched 24 armed police officers and another detective team to protect him along the way.</p>
<p>After this case occurred on the 21st at noon, Zhao Fang strongly claimed that he was ambushed by Chinese anti-Japanese people. Rumors arose in the market, and the situation was serious. The Qilu area was under martial law by our military and police, searching pedestrians. However, there were many doubts in this case, because when Kakuta suddenly fell, he was seen by the police officer, and there was no gunfire. Nearby residents also did not see anything unusual. On the 22nd, the Japanese Consulate repeatedly used the telephone to question the Municipal Government about how to handle this case. In addition to reporting to Guangzhou, the Municipal Government replied that the matter was still under investigation. Also, Japanese 13th Destroyer Squadron Commander Nishigang Shigetai, a lieutenant colonel, led the Hayanae and Gotake ships to Shantou on the 20th and visited Mayor Li Yuanhe. On the 22nd, Li returned the visit to the Japanese Consulate as usual. Nishigang smiled and asked Li, "Kakuta's unfortunate ambush is very sad. It is regrettable that a public official of our country has such a tragic incident in Shantou. It is because your government's protection is not complete," and so on. Since Nishigang made such a statement, the attitude of the Japanese side can be imagined. At noon on the 22nd, the Japanese warship Yubari sailed into the port. The Japanese Consul sent Secretary Mai Wen to the Municipal Government, stating that the Yubari ship came to Shantou specifically to protect Japanese residents in the Kakuta case. At around 3:00 pm, the Japanese warship sent signalmen carrying flags, torches, and luggage to the Japanese Consulate, signaling each other on the observation platform. The Yubari warship's cannons were aimed at the Shantou Municipal Government Public Security Bureau. On the evening of the 23rd, they fired over a hundred shots at the sea off Jiaoshi, at which time it was New Year's Eve, and people's hearts were very uneasy. However, they had left Shantou by the 27th. Japanese South China Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Ogawa and 5th Submarine Flotilla Commander Rear Admiral Hosokawa arrived in Shantou one after another some time ago. It is said that they all came to negotiate this case. Recently, Major General Ogisu, Chief of Staff of the Taiwan Army touring Guangdong and Guangxi, and Lieutenant Colonel Hattori, a staff officer, arrived in Shantou on the 27th morning from Hong Kong on the Japanese ship Guangdong Maru and went straight to the Japanese Consulate to discuss measures to deal with the Kakuta case with the naval officers. Li Hanhun, a member of the Eastern District Appeasement Office, went to the province for many days. Because of this incident, the case was serious. On the 27th, he returned to Shantou on the Haizhen ship with Customs Supervisor Zhang Jinghui to preside over the handling of this case. Currently, Chaoshan is under martial law. The demands put forward by the Japanese side are kept strictly secret by the authorities, so the content is unknown. (28th)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Liu Guitang's Bandit Gang Raids the Border Between Hebei and Henan with a Background of Trying to Take a Base in the Border Area Between Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. They Commit Rape, Murder, Looting, and Arson Wherever They Pass, Inciting the Secret Societies of Daming and Shunde to Echo Them. <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Liu Guitang's bandit gang, since they fled from Sihainei, Yanqing County, Chahar, have been provided with a large amount of military supplies by a certain party, so they have acted like wolves and boars, passing through the counties of Laishui, Lingshou, Yi County, Tang County, Wan County, Xing Tang, Fuping, Quyang, and Ren County in western Hebei, and heading south. Before the Spring Festival, they captured Xing Tang, Ren County, Quyang, and Laishui, looting them fully. After that, they broke through the encirclement and defense lines of the military police teams and planned to flee into Shandong along the Jinpu Line. After being intercepted by the Shandong army, they fled back to the hinterland of Hebei Province. The counties of Zanhuang, Yuanshi, Neiqiu, Nanle, and Jingxing, and Huolu were all ravaged by Liu's bandits. At that time, it was the end of the lunar year everywhere, and every family was celebrating the New Year, unprepared. Wherever the bandits passed, they raped, murdered, looted, and set fire to houses. Often, the fire would not go out for several days after the bandits left. At first, the villagers fled to avoid the bandits. When they returned after the chaos, they had no house to live in and no clothes to wear. The misery of the robbery was even worse than when the bandit gang raided south in the 23rd year. Since Liu's bandits fled south, initially, the 38th and 37th divisions of the 29th Army each dispatched a regiment, and the 53rd Army also dispatched a regiment, to pursue and attack them in different ways. However, the command was inconsistent, and the dispatch of troops could not be quickly responded to the situation, causing the bandit gang to flee through more than 20 counties, as if entering no man's land. By the time the disaster was severe, the bandit forces had expanded several times, and it was no longer easy to put them out. At this time, the various armies were ordered to strictly suppress them, but the problem had been allowed to fester, and it was not easy to solve. Recently, Liu Guitang himself personally led the bandit gangs of Da Wulong, Zhang Haijiao, Wang Yanru, and Jin Huanwen, etc., numbering six to seven thousand, and divided them into a three-army, five-brigade organization, still using the pseudo-East Asia Autonomous Allied Army name, and fled separately to Daming and Xingtai in southern Hebei. The advance bandit forces have even invaded near Wu'an and Handan. Judging from the situation, they will enter Henan from Neihuang. If they fail, they will pass through Dongming and Puyang, and head west to flee into Pucheng and Chaocheng in Shandong Province. Currently, the 725th regiment of Feng Zhian's troops of the 37th Division of the 29th Army, led by Deputy Division Commander Chen Chunrong, and a regiment of Sun Deying's 119th Division of the 53rd Army, a regiment of Feng Zhanhai's troops of the 63rd Army, a regiment of Huang Guanghua's troops of the 138th Division of the 32nd Army, and the militia and police teams of Daming, Natay, Nanle, and Qingfeng counties in southern Hebei are operating a large encirclement, gradually pressing the bandit gang, intending to force them into a corner and wipe them out in one fell swoop. Wang Qifeng's Fourth Cavalry Division stationed in Xingtai and Handan also recently issued an order to move out and conduct guerrilla warfare near Handan.</p>
<p>It is said that there are people from a certain country within this bandit gang, so their actions and goals are planned, and they plan to take a base at the junction of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan as a source of offensive and defensive strategies. Neihuang in northern Henan, and Daming and Nanle counties in southern Hebei, suffered from famine and saltpeter problems last year, causing people to live in misery. There are many pseudo-organizations such as the Red Spear Society, Yellow Sand Society, and Jinsheng Tao in various counties and towns. The conditions for rebellion are ready. Once incited, riots are easy to occur. Liu's bandits also plan to use the famine victims in various places to expand the bandit forces and carry out a large-scale disaster plan. Recently, foreign news has widely reported that communist parties have been discovered in Daming, Shunde, and other counties, echoing Liu Guitang's bandit gang, and taking Shunde as a base. The North China Japanese Garrison Army immediately sent personnel to visit the Hebei-Chahar authorities to inquire about the truth and whether there were any solutions. It has recently been investigated that the so-called communist party is actually a misrepresentation of the Red Spear Society and Yellow Sand Society, and their strength is not as great as reported. Guanxian, Chaocheng, Fanxian, and Pucheng in western Shandong, and Daming, Nanle, Qingfeng, Puyang, and Neihuang in northern Henan in southern Hebei have formed a joint defense to prevent Liu's bandits from joining forces with the secret societies, and will support each other in the event of a bandit alarm, hoping to put out the bandit forces at the beginning of their germination. The Hebei-Chahar authorities also plan to reinstate Sun Dianying as the commander of the bandit suppression in southern Hebei, contacting the recruitment and appeasement of Liu's bandit gang. If they can be reorganized into the army, they will be led by Sun. Otherwise, they will allocate formal troops, unify command, and thoroughly suppress them. Sun has already gone to Ping one day ago to transfer to Baoding for negotiations. (1st)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Liu Shinan, a Notorious Bandit in Southern Hebei, is Arrested. Last Year, He Was Instigated by a Certain Foreign National to Disrupt the Region. Recently, He Gathered His Remaining Followers to Communicate with Liu Guitang. He Was Escorted to Jinan Along with Two Flags of the Puppet Manchurian State. <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Shunde Correspondence: Liu Shinan, a notorious bandit who has long plagued the borders of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces and communicated with the bandit Liu Guitang, has been rampaging in Qingfeng, Nanle, Daming, Puyang, Dongming, Shunde in southern Hebei, and Puyang, Fanxian, Shou Zhang, Yanggu, Guantao, and Shenxian counties in Shandong for eight or nine years. He has a great appeal, and small scattered groups admire his name and rely on his influence. In the area of Shou Zhang and Yanggu, the head of the bandits is Yu Qishui. Liu Dongfeng also listens to his command, repeatedly resisting government troops, attacking cities and looting villages, turning everything into ruins wherever he goes. Last year, during the Red Spear Society uprising in southern Hebei, Liu was its main force. Recently, he colluded with the puppet Manchurian state and Liu Guitang, and was instigated by a certain foreign national behind the scenes to carry out disturbances. Fortunately, on the night of the 14th of last month, he was captured by Wang Jiayou, the magistrate of Shenxian County, in Xiguan, this city (Shunde). On the 31st, he was escorted to Jinan. Not only were the people delighted, but the local area was also rid of a source of trouble. He is currently under strict interrogation. Details obtained through inquiries are described below.</p>
<p>The bandit Liu is from Shenxian County in Shandong Province. He once served as the chief investigator in this county, so many local people know him. Last summer, the Red Spear Society uprising in southern Hebei gathered thousands of people, shocking far and wide. Because the area is very close to Shandong Province, Li Shuchun, the Director of Civil Affairs of Shandong Province, personally inspected and directed the officials and people of various counties in western Shandong, strictly guarding against its impact. At that time, Li Shuchun, because Liu Shinan was from Shenxian County in Shandong, instructed County Magistrate Wang Jiayou to pay attention at all times. Recently, Liu was plotting to stir up trouble in Shunde, so Wang Jiayou paid even more attention. Later, he captured Liu's sister and learned his address. He then used a squad leader from a certain district in Shenxian County as an informant and came to Shunde in disguise to arrest him. Because the squad leader knew Liu, he wore a military uniform and dark glasses to avoid being recognized. After arriving in Shunde, he also met Liu's son and confirmed that Liu was indeed in Shunde. He then, together with the Shunde militia and the 4th Cavalry Division of the garrison, captured Liu in Xiguan, Shunde, and seized two flags of the puppet Manchurian state. Liu's wife, Mrs. Li, and Liu's eldest son, Liu Ziming (who was studying at Yuying Middle School), and his younger son, Liu Ziyu, a follower of the bandit Tian Yunze, were also captured together. Because Liu's latent influence in the Daming area is very large, fearing accidents, he telegraphed Chairman Han to report. He then received a reply telegram, approving the transfer via the Pinghan Railway to the Longhai Railway and then to Xuzhou, and then escorted to Jinan via the Jinpu Railway. After Wang Jiayou captured the bandit Liu, he interrogated him carefully. According to Liu, he is 42 years old this year, a native of Liyuan Village, Shenxian County. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, he served as the chief investigator of this county, and later became a bandit. In the 14th year of the Republic of China, he served as the commander of the mixed regiment of Wang Guanjun's bandit army. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, after Zhang Zongchang lost power, he retreated to Daming to become a bandit (he had previously been arrested and imprisoned once, but escaped by bribing the prison guards). Last summer, he was the leader of the riot in Jintan Town, Hebei Province, and was appointed by a certain party as the leader of the puppet North China People's Autonomous Defense Corps detachment. Recently, he gathered his old subordinates in Shunde. He himself mistakenly embarked on the wrong path and is willing to accept his punishment, but his two sons are innocent and should be released, etc. Liu is tall, has a dark face, thick eyebrows, and large eyes. He wears a long leather robe, with a vest on the outside, and a black leather Turkish hat. One can tell at a glance that he is a member of the Green Forest.</p>
<p>Looking back to last summer, when the bandits occupied the Jinlongwang Temple in Jintan near Daming, the momentum was great, and the armies of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces converged, surrounding them for many days before the bandits were resolved. At that time, Liu Shinan was actually the leader and was heavily relied upon by a certain party as the leader of the puppet North China People's Autonomous Defense Corps, with a position above Zhao Dehuai. A certain foreign national secretly took the initiative to provide assistance. A person named Ergong, a military advisor, once went there three times by plane with the translator Ma Yixuan. Each time they arrived, the bandits in Jintan Town raised the Rising Sun Flag as a signal, and the plane landed. They received a total of 800 yuan in assistance, and it was stated that guns and ammunition would be fully supplied, as long as the bandits could continue the riot. Although the bandits did not succeed, their remaining followers still lurked in the southern Hebei area. Last winter, when the North China Incident occurred, Liu was again appointed as the commander of the 1st Army of the 1st Route of the puppet North China People's Autonomous Defense Army, responsible for disrupting Qingfeng, Nanle, Daming, Dongming, and Puyang in southern Hebei. He once went to Tianjin to meet with a certain retired military officer living in Matsushima Street, introduced by Zhao Qian. Wu Dongting also introduced him to Liu Guitang. Recently, he gathered more than 300 people, attempting to riot, but was fortunately arrested, which can be celebrated as the removal of a hidden danger. (One Day)</p>

<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, returned to his ancestral home in Shiqiao, south of Leling County, Shandong Province, on the 31st of last month with a team of guards by car to sweep the tombs. He arrived there that night. According to news obtained here, Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, upon hearing the news of Song's arrival in Shandong, also went to Leling by car early on the 1st to meet with Song. The two men have a deep private friendship and have been separated for a long time. Han took advantage of Song's tomb-sweeping to have a good meeting. The two men did not enter the city when they arrived in Leling, but met at Song's village residence. Han left Leling on the 2nd to return to Jinan, while Song is scheduled to leave Leling on the 3rd or 4th to return to Tianjin and then go directly back to Beiping. (February 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e76">The Zhuzhou-Shaoguan Section of the Yuehan Railway Will Be Completed, The Yuehan Railway May Be Open to Traffic in June This Year, Building the Southwest Railway Bridge to Connect with the Guangsanshui Railway <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The construction of the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section of the Yuehan Railway has been accelerated in recent years. In addition to the small sections from Shaoguan to Lechang and from Lechang to Dashimen, which have already been opened to traffic, the roadbed extending from the Guangdong border to Qimen on the Guangdong-Hunan border has also been built. The Hunan section, from Hengzhou to Zhuzhou, is also said to be nearing completion. However, the bridges are still under construction due to the massive engineering involved. It is reported that there are three large iron bridges from Hengzhou to Zhuzhou, two of which are nearing completion, and one of which has not yet started construction. In the future, when the entire railway track is completed, if it is necessary to open to traffic in advance, a temporary light bridge can be built to replace the unfinished bridge to facilitate the passage of vehicles. At present, the roadbed from Zhuzhou to the junction of Hunan and Guangdong, connecting with Qimen, has been completed by 70% to 80%. It is expected to be fully completed by the end of April this year. Ling Hongxun, the director of the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan Railway Section Project Bureau, came to Guangdong last month to discuss with the Guangzhou-Shaoguan Railway Bureau the date of opening the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan and Guangzhou-Shaoguan lines and the method of operation. If the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section is opened to traffic, the northern and southern ends of the Yuehan Railway can be connected. If there are no obstacles, the date of direct traffic on the Yuehan Railway is expected to be in May or June of this year. Furthermore, the Yuehan Railway is the main north-south line, and the Guangsanshui Railway is its branch line, which is very important to the transportation between the two Guangdong provinces. However, they have not been able to connect. In order to connect the Yuehan Railway and the Guangsanshui Railway, the Guangzhou-Shaoguan Railway Bureau and the Guangzhou Municipal Works Bureau have previously built a southwest iron bridge in Niugusha, outside the western suburbs of Guangzhou, to connect the Guangzhou-Shaoguan and Guangsanshui Railways. The bridge project is being undertaken by the American Markdon Company. Since construction began, several bridge piers have been completed, but the bridge steel has not yet been transported. The authorities believe that with the opening of the northern and southern sections of the Yuehan Railway, the construction of the southwest iron bridge is also urgent. They have sent a telegram to the Markdon construction company, urging them to ship the bridge steel from the United States. It is reported that the company, after receiving the telegram, will ship the bridge materials to Guangdong in batches, rushing to complete them around the time of the opening of the northern and southern sections of the Yuehan Railway, so that in the future, southbound passenger and freight cars on the Yuehan Railway can go directly from Hankou to Sanshui and transfer to Guangxi.

<h3 id="e77">Qingdao, The Third Pier is Completed, The Construction Cost is Estimated at 3.9 Million Yuan, Eight 6,000-Ton Ships Can be Reliably Moored at the Same Time <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The city's third pier officially started construction in July 1932, and by the end of January this year, it has been fully completed, taking four years. The construction cost totaled 4 million yuan, making it the first major building since China took over Qingdao. It has been scheduled to hold a completion ceremony on February 10. Mayor Shen Honglie specially convened relevant personnel from various agencies in the City Hall yesterday to hold a preparatory meeting for the completion ceremony. It was decided that the Municipal Government would be responsible for entertaining the guests, the Public Security Bureau would be responsible for transportation, cleaning, and fire protection, and the Port Affairs Bureau would be responsible for the arrangement of the venue. The Municipal Government also allocated 5,000 yuan for all expenses during the ceremony. In order to show his solemnity, Shen not only invited various agencies and groups in the city to attend the ceremony, but also telegraphed the various ministries and commissions of the Central Government to send representatives to Qingdao to participate and deliver speeches. It is reported that Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, will personally attend the grand ceremony in Qingdao.</p>
<p>Qingdao controls the throat of North China and serves as the gateway to Shandong. On land, the Jiaoji Railway extends westward, deep into the hinterland. By water, it reaches Liaoji in the north, Shanghai and Guangdong in the south, and even Europe, America, Japan, and other ports. Transportation is convenient in all directions, making it a first-class port in East Asia. However, the port originally had only four piers, with a total of 21 berths and 7 warehouses, for berthing ships and loading and unloading goods. However, since the 18th and 19th years of the Republic of China, the number of ships has increased and the volume of goods has grown daily. As a result, the allocation of berths has become exhausted, and the loading and unloading of goods has become crowded. The shortage of piers has become obvious. In addition, coal accounts for nearly one-quarter of the total exports. At a time when Shandong coal is becoming increasingly developed, building a wider pier is a matter of urgency. The Municipal Government, in view of this, has set aside a portion of the pier revenue amidst extremely tight finances, accumulating it over the years as a fund for building the pier. After detailed evaluation by the Port Affairs Bureau, it was decided to adopt the concrete block method, because the project is solid and provides lasting benefits, and cement and gravel can be used nearby, which is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. After the Port Affairs Bureau completed the design of the pier, it submitted the proposed drawings and construction details to the Municipal Government for the Purchasing Committee to invite contractors in accordance with the bidding regulations. As a result, the Dalian Fuchang Company won the bid with the lowest price of 3.9 million yuan. A contract was signed immediately, and construction officially started on July 1, 1932, with an estimated completion time of four years. However, because the project progressed extremely smoothly, it was completed ahead of schedule by the end of January this year.</p>
<p>The pier is located between the second and fourth piers. Both the north and south sides have 160 meters of sea surface, allowing ships to moor and depart without hindrance. The northwest corner is in line with the northwest corner of the first and second piers, making it easy for ships to enter and exit. The stone embankment between the pier and the second pier is 190 meters long, and the road between it and the fourth pier is 600 meters long, making transportation very convenient. The south bank of the pier is 445 meters long, the north bank is 593 meters long, and the width is 100 meters. It can reliably moor eight 6,000-ton ships at the same time. The height of the shore wall is 0.6 meters above the Qingdao sea level zero point, the water depth at ordinary low tide is 9.5 meters, and the water depth at ordinary high tide is 13.1 meters. Therefore, ships of tens of thousands of tons can also berth directly. In the future, merchant ships will find it more convenient to travel, and the prosperity of Qingdao City can be predicted.

<p>The third branch of the Xinzhuang Winter Defense Office, together with the sixth police station patrol officer Lu Jianfen, received a report that Peng Jiu, one of the criminals involved in the Zhang Hungen robbery case in Zhangjiatang, was from Pengjiatang No. 17 Tu, and had recently sneaked back to his hometown. At 4:00 pm on the 31st, he was arrested at the Bu Family Teahouse, brought to the office for preliminary interrogation, and confessed without denial. He also confessed that the case was initiated by Cui Dequan and done in partnership with Qu Laosi. A team was dispatched to arrest them and met Qu Laosi on the way, who was immediately apprehended. When they arrived at Cui Dequan's house, it was already dark, and he escaped from the wall. They were arrested a second time, but he escaped by climbing onto the roof. A flashlight and iron ruler were found on the roof. It was not until dawn on the 1st that Cui Dequan was captured. All confessed directly. Winter Defense Director Shi Gongming and Patrol Officer Lu Jianfen have prepared a document and submitted it to the county government for interrogation.</p>

<p>The Suzhou County Chamber of Commerce and the Lawyers Association believe that the recent fee schedule set by the Suzhou County Telephone Bureau classifies business associations as Category B users, which suddenly increases the burden on various groups. They telegraphed the Ministry of Communications to request the Suzhou County Telephone Bureau to reduce the fees to alleviate the burden. Yesterday, they received instructions from the Ministry of Communications stating that the "General Rules for Urban Telephone Business Operations" promulgated and implemented by the Ministry in July 1935 already have provisions for user categories. The Suzhou County Telephone Bureau's classification of law firms, accounting firms, architectural firms, and business users as Category B users for charging fees is in accordance with the provisions of the General Rules and is not inappropriate. However, the residences of lawyers, accountants, etc. are private residences, not offices for performing duties, and should be charged as Category A users. However, if it is found that offices for performing duties are falsely reported as residences, they shall be punished in accordance with the provisions of Article 84 of the General Rules. This matter concerns general cases, and the request should not be discussed, etc. After receiving the order, the County Chamber of Commerce immediately notified the Lawyers Association to continue to fight vigorously.</p>

<p>The Suzhou Broadcasting Station at No. 600 Lindun Road, founded by Wu Keming, was the most well-equipped radio station in Suzhou. On the morning of the 3rd, at 4:00 am, the radio station suddenly reported a short circuit. Because it was difficult to rescue in the middle of the night, it soon broke through the roof. After various fire brigades drove to the scene and worked hard to extinguish the fire, it was finally extinguished. The radio station and office buildings were completely burned down, and the fire spread to four or five neighboring businesses, including Zhou Wanxing's Mingwa store, all of which were reduced to ashes. A total of more than 20 rooms were burned, and in addition to the radio station's loss of more than 10,000 gold, the loss to those affected was also huge.</p>

<p>At about 12:00 pm on the 2nd, more than ten bandits carrying guns and weapons arrived in Zhengyi Gao Village, under the jurisdiction of the county, and swarmed into the house of Zhou Changhua, the chief of the second Jia of the fifth Bao of the village, to rob. The Jia chief took the opportunity to escape and sounded the gong to warn the village. Fortunately, before the winter defense, the joint village defense had been organized and completed, so each village heard the alarm and responded with the sound of gongs. Soon, more than 200 farmers gathered, blocked the main points, and successively captured eight bandits. When the patrol officer from the branch station arrived, the bandits, together with their guns and ammunition, were taken to the station and temporarily sent to the county bureau for interrogation. Four of the bandits had their heads broken by the farmers.</p>

<p>Since receiving the provincial order to handle the self-renewal registration of opium addicts and the general reporting of opium criminals, the Qingpu County Government convened a county-wide anti-opium conference in late November of last year and scheduled a publicity week. Then, taking advantage of the opportunity to train Jia chiefs, the self-renewal registration and general reporting methods and the responsibilities of Bao and Jia chiefs were incorporated into the training handouts. County Magistrate Qian Jianiang personally went to each training center to explain, and after the registration started last month, County Magistrate Qian arranged a schedule to personally go to each district to convene township and village Bao and Jia chiefs to give instructions and supervise the progress. The number of people registering was extremely enthusiastic. In the middle of last month, Provincial Committee Member Chao Mei came to Qingpu, and County Magistrate Qian again worked with the committee members to go to the countryside for several days, and the work became more intensive. By the end of January, more than 1,300 people had registered for self-renewal. Now that the provincial order has extended the self-renewal period by half a month, the County Government, in order to thoroughly eliminate opium, specially convened a discussion on February 1st with personnel handling the prohibition administration to determine effective measures for compulsory registration, so as to ensure that no opium addict in the county is missed. It is learned that the number of registered opium addicts in the county's first resolution accounts for 2% of the county's population. With this resolution for self-renewal registration, there is hope for thoroughly eliminating opium.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in the past, considered the scholarship and writings of Mr. Tang Jingchuan of Wuyi County to be a model for the world, and his suppression of the Japanese pirates was a hero of the nation. He was honored as a local worthy, and a biography and ancestral hall were established. In addition, the thatched cottage where Mr. Tang studied in Chendu was dilapidated. The county was ordered to raise funds for repairs. His descendant, Ziquan, has been undertaking the repairs since Tang and has been doing so for several months. The ten rooms of the thatched cottage in Chendu are built with steel and concrete by a Wuxi construction company. It has now been completed, and it is spacious, exquisite, and newly decorated. There are still projects such as paving roads and building artificial hills. It is expected that all will be completed during the Qingming Festival. This year's tree planting ceremony will be held there.</p>
<p>Why Do We Study Mathematics? And How Do We Study Mathematics? (Part 2) Professor Ren Mengxian of Daxia University (Lectures to students of secondary schools across the country on January 9th and 11th, 1936)</p>
<p>The third type is the student who doesn't burn incense on ordinary days but hugs Buddha's feet temporarily. But because he knows to work temporarily and gets relief early, his grades are still pretty good. The second type is the student who learns wherever the teacher teaches and doesn't particularly intensify his efforts, but just follows the routine and progresses step by step. This type of student is actually hard to come by! And the first type of student is the one who automatically makes efforts beforehand, doesn't wait for the teacher's prompting, doesn't work hard for the sake of exam scores, and his grades naturally improve. This type of student is truly rare and unique! This method of paying attention to things beforehand is the most important step in the three learning processes that I want to introduce to you today. What are those three learning processes?</p>
<p>First, Preview Before Class. The common interpretation of the words "work hard" refers to efforts after class, while entrusting the preparation beforehand to the teacher. Few people advocate that students should also prepare before class. I call this preparation work "preview." Preview is the most important stage in the learning process. For example, when watching a movie, if you haven't read the instructions beforehand, even if the movie is very exciting, you will find it bland and tasteless. Even watching a movie requires previewing, let alone learning mathematics? If we review all the theorems or methods to be studied before class, mark any doubts, and ask the teacher during class, we can understand without much explanation. You must know that to have insights in learning any subject, you must first have questions, and the questions must be discovered by yourself in order to feel intimate and interesting, and to scratch the itch. Otherwise, if the teacher teaches brilliantly, you can't understand it, and if the teacher doesn't teach thoroughly, you can't express your doubts and let it go lightly. This means that the first step of learning has not been successful, which is most regrettable.</p>
<p>Second, Pay Attention During Class. After having the first step of previewing before class, it is even more important to concentrate and listen to the teacher's questions and explanations, as well as the discussions of other classmates. If my doubts have not been explained by anyone, I can raise them at any time to seek answers. Then, regarding the matters learned, I can fully understand them during class. Otherwise, the second step of learning has not been successful, and even if you preview, it will be in vain. We must know that if the first step of previewing has been abandoned, it can still be remedied by the second step. If the first step has been abandoned and the second step has not been paid enough attention, then it is a mistake upon mistake, which cannot be recovered! I often see many students who don't bring paper and pens to class, but sit there blankly with their hands idle for fifty minutes. What are they thinking about? I don't know. There are also some who listen to the lecture while doing other things with their hands, and some who talk to each other, or even hang their heads and pretend to sleep. There are all kinds of strange shapes and forms. You must know that for mathematics, just casually neglecting it within a few hours of class in the first week or two of school will lead to more difficulties later. Because this type of subject progresses step by step, it is not difficult at all. But if you skip one step, you will find it increasingly difficult, and even if you can barely make up for it later, the situation of being busy, catching up, and cramming is very painful! I hope these young people will realize this immediately and make use of their valuable class time!</p>
<p>Third, Practice After Class. Mathematics is a subject that not only emphasizes understanding, but also requires sufficient practice. Because the effects of practice are fourfold: 1. It can thoroughly understand the theory learned. 2. It can closely apply the known methods. 3. It can memorize useful formulas. 4. It can solve the problems encountered on its own. The profundity of mathematical theory, the complexity of methods, and the countless changes in problems are all recognized difficulties that can only be solved and remedied by diligent practice and doing more exercises. However, students generally feel that there are too many mathematics exercises and not enough time to practice. In fact, in their short study time, they not only have to do the exercise assignments, but also have to first put in the effort to understand. Since they didn't preview beforehand and failed to concentrate during class, they only start working hard after class. They have no impression of what the teacher said, so they have to work hard on their own. As a result, smart students rely purely on self-study and self-practice, and the time is naturally more insufficient. Those who are less talented have no way to start! This is a mistake upon mistake, even three mistakes. As a result, their mathematics grades are poor. It is not mathematics that is misleading people, but the scholars themselves who are misleading themselves!</p>
<p>Some people say: I have prepared before class, paid attention during class, and practiced after class, but I still feel very busy during the exam and my grades are still not good. What is the reason for this? If this is the case, on the one hand, it can be said that the teachers are strict in their exams and the school is running diligently; on the other hand, it can also be said that there is still room for research on learning methods.</p>
<p>Correction: In yesterday's Education Broadcast Special Issue, from the 25th line of the third paragraph "As mentioned above..." to the 35th line of the fourth paragraph "...the best method for the greatest purpose," this is the conclusion of the article and should be placed here. However, due to an error in layout, it was placed before "In short, studying mathematics can correct various bad habits in society..." We hereby correct this.</p>

<h3 id="e85">The Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange - Public Announcement of Temporary Market Closure Yesterday Morning - Board Meeting Held to Report on the Issuance of New Bonds - Disaster Relief and Other Public Bond Lottery Decisions to Proceed as Scheduled - Two New Public Bonds to Pay 9 Million Yuan in Monthly Interest <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports: After various sectors expressed their support for the Ministry of Finance's issuance of the Unified and Reconstruction Public Bonds, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was ordered to publicly announce a temporary market closure. A board meeting was held to report on the progress. The lottery for the 20th Year Disaster Relief and the 6% and 7% Public Bonds, scheduled for February 10th for principal repayment, will proceed as planned. The Director of the Public Debt Department, Jiang Lufu, arrived in Shanghai to oversee the issuance. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Securities Trading - Temporary Market Closure Implemented</p>
<p>The Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange issued Public Announcement No. 2249 yesterday, stating: "Pursuant to the order of the Ministry of Finance, the recent trading situation of the Exchange, the types and amounts of transactions by various brokers, and whether there is any speculation or manipulation are currently being thoroughly investigated by officials dispatched by the Ministry. Before the investigation is fully completed, the Exchange should temporarily suspend trading. Please comply accordingly and inform all brokers to comply as well." Therefore, starting today, the Exchange will comply with the order and implement a temporary market closure. Special announcement, February 3rd, 25th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Disaster Relief and Other Bonds - Lottery to Proceed as Scheduled</p>
<p>The first tranche of the 20th Year Disaster Relief Public Bonds, the sixteenth repayment of principal, the seventh repayment of principal for the 7% Consolidated Public Bonds, and the seventh repayment of principal for the 6% Consolidated Public Bonds, were originally scheduled to be drawn on February 10th at 10:00 AM in Shanghai. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the National Treasury Department yesterday morning that the announcement of the lottery for principal repayment of the aforementioned public bonds preceded the issuance of the Unified Public Bonds. Furthermore, the principal repayments are for December of the 24th year and January and February of the 25th year, so the lottery will proceed as planned. The amount of principal to be repaid will also be handled according to the previous regulations. However, all subsequent items will be handled according to the Unified Public Bonds.</p>
<p>Board Meeting Reports on Progress</p>
<p>The Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange held a board meeting in the board room at 5:00 PM yesterday. Fifteen directors attended, including Zhang Weiru, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Wu Yunzhai, and Chen Duoru. Chairman Zhang Weiru presided over the meeting, reporting on the Ministry of Finance's issuance of 146 million yuan in Unified Public Bonds and 34 million yuan in Reconstruction Public Bonds, as well as the order to temporarily suspend trading. The meeting adjourned around 6:00 PM. According to a Xinsheng News Agency reporter, the reopening date of the Exchange will depend on the order of the Ministry of Finance. In the future, trading will be in a single type of Unified Public Bonds, but divided into categories A, B, C, D, and E.</p>
<p>New Public Bonds - Principal Repayment and Interest Payment</p>
<p>The total issuance of Unified Public Bonds is 146 million yuan, and the total issuance of Reconstruction Public Bonds is 34 million yuan. The total amount of these two public bonds is 180 million yuan. Calculated at an annual interest rate of 6%, the annual interest payment is 10.8 million yuan, which means a monthly interest payment of 9 million yuan. Previously, principal and interest payments for public bonds were made quarterly, and for treasury bills, they were made monthly. Now, the Unified Public Bonds stipulate that principal and interest payments will be made semi-annually. The National Debt Fund Management Committee will handle matters related to principal and interest payments.</p>
<p>The Three "Jin" Types Remain as Originally Planned</p>
<p>In addition to the regulations for the various types of Unified Public Bonds (A, B, C, D, and E) issued by the Ministry of Finance:</p>
<p>*   The Post-Reorganization Short-Term Bonds, issued in July of the 17th year, with a total of 40 million yuan and an interest rate of 8%, will be fully repaid by the end of March of the 25th year. Because the remaining amount is not much.</p>
<p>*   The 17th Year Long-Term Financial Bonds, issued in November of the 17th year, with a total of 45 million yuan and an interest rate of 2.5%, will be fully repaid by September of the 42nd year. Because the originally set interest rate was quite low and the term was long.</p>
<p>*   The Haihe Public Bonds, issued in April of the 18th year, with a total of 4 million yuan and a monthly interest rate of 8%, will be fully repaid by April 20th of the 28th year. The fund is secured by an additional 8% levy on the 5% tax collected by the Tianjin Customs. Because the fund is specifically designated as an additional tax.</p>
<p>The above three types will be handled according to the original plan.</p>
<p>Provincial and Municipal Bonds Also Remain as Before</p>
<p>In addition, construction public bonds from various provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, and Hunan; Shanghai municipal public bonds; reconstruction public bonds; the first and second tranche construction public bonds of the Ministry of Railways; telecommunications public bonds of the Ministry of Communications; Yuping Railway public bonds; long and short-term public bonds for electrical enterprises of the Construction Committee; continued issuance of electrical enterprise public bonds; the 21st Year Silk Industry Public Bonds, etc., will all still be handled according to the original plan and are not included in the unification.</p>
<p>Six Types of Securities with No Secured Funds</p>
<p>Issued by the former Beijing government, with overdue principal and interest and no secured funds, and not included in the Unified Public Bonds:</p>
<p>*   The 8th Year Consolidated Public Bonds; these two public bonds are the second tranche consolidated bonds of the first year public bonds and the eighth year public bonds. The amount of the second tranche consolidated bonds of the first year public bonds is 25.6 million yuan, and the amount of the second tranche consolidated bonds of the eighth year public bonds is 8.8 million yuan.</p>
<p>*   The 9th Year Disaster Relief Public Bonds, with a fixed amount of 4 million yuan, actually issued 2,168,475 yuan.</p>
<p>*   The 96 Public Bonds, with a fixed amount of 96 million yuan.</p>
<p>*   The 14 Treasury Bills, with an amount of 14 million yuan.</p>
<p>*   The Ministry of Communications Exchange Bills, with a fixed amount of 8 million yuan.</p>
<p>*   The Mid-Autumn Festival Treasury Bills, with a fixed amount of 3 million yuan.</p>

<p>The Director of the Public Debt Department, Jiang Lufu, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday and immediately met with the three section chiefs, Zong, Dong, etc., to handle the issuance of the Unified and Reconstruction Public Bonds. They have been very busy these past few days, collecting the old public bonds and treasury bills and issuing the new Unified Public Bonds in their place. It is expected to be completed within three months. At the same time, he will also oversee the lottery for the Disaster Relief and other three public bonds on February 10th. Furthermore, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi went to Beijing last night to attend the routine meeting of the Executive Yuan and report on the progress of issuing the Unified and Reconstruction Public Bonds.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports: Xu Chongzhi, Vice President of the Control Yuan, went south this time to welcome Chairman Hu Zhantang of the Central Standing Committee. He had already left Hong Kong on the Jackson President of the Dollar Steamship Company with Xu Lingjun and his daughter a few days ago and returned north. He arrived in Shanghai at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning. The ship berthed at riverbanks 16 and 17 in Puzhong. Those who went to welcome him included Wang Zhinan, representing Yang Hu, Director of the Municipal Security Department, Kang Zhaoshi, Secretary of the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office, and many of Xu's relatives and children. Xu then transferred to the Jinghui ferry at around 9:00 AM, disembarked at the New Customs Wharf, and went directly to his private residence on Seymour Road to rest. He is scheduled to rest in Shanghai for a while before going to Beijing. According to Xu, Mr. Hu Zhantang has decided to come north in the coming days, and Mr. Xiao Focheng will also travel with him. However, the departure date has not yet been determined. Xu also published a written statement on the ship, saying, "This time I decided to return to Guangdong in a private capacity. In addition to paying respects to the Huanghuagang and the graves of various martyrs, and sweeping the tombs of my ancestors, and inquiring about the comrades and relatives who stayed in Guangdong, I will also meet with Mr. Hu Zhantang. After arriving in Hong Kong from Shanghai, I went to Guangzhou for a few days. I saw that there was considerable progress in the construction of various places, and the local area was quite peaceful. The construction of Sun Yat-sen University can be said to be magnificent, which is gratifying. I then went to Hong Kong and met with Mr. Hu Zhantang. I saw that he was in good spirits, but his body was thin, as always. Now Mr. Zhantang has gone to Guangzhou. I heard that he is slightly unwell and may need to rest for a while. I think he will be able to come to Beijing and Shanghai soon to meet with his comrades. I have finished my private affairs and will return to Shanghai first."</p>

<p>The new Brazilian Ambassador to China, Lai Gu, passed through Japan and took the Dollar Steamship Company's McKinley President ship. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but it was reported that it would be delayed by one day.

<h3 id="e91">Outside Dagu Port - The Ruikang Ship Trapped in Ice - Difficult to Advance or Retreat, Coal and Food Running Out - The Yushun Ship Also Finds It Difficult to Return to Shanghai <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Ruikang ship of the Shoukang Shipping Company in this port, with a deadweight of 2,316 tons, a length of 300 feet, a width of 42 feet 7 inches, a depth of 19 feet 1 inch, and a draft of 18 feet 7 inches, was built in the United Kingdom in 1897. It decided to sail from Osaka, Japan, back to China, directly to Tanggu, Tianjin, to prepare to load coal and deliver it to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, it was trapped by the ice layer outside Tianjin, causing danger.</p>
<p>Surrounded by Ice</p>
<p>On the 2nd of this month, the ship sailed to Tianjin. The ice outside Dagu Port was more than 100 li (Chinese miles) thick and had not melted for over a week, blocking the waterway. The ship sailed to 30 nautical miles (100 Chinese miles) outside Dagu Port, and the ship was trapped in the ice and unable to move forward or backward. The shipowner urgently telegraphed the company and asked the Tianjin Shipping Company to send a large tugboat to tow it in an attempt to enter Tanggu. However, in reality, the tugboat was unable to sail out of Dagu Port, causing Ruikang to be unable to advance or retreat.</p>
<p>Running Out of Coal and Food</p>
<p>Since the tugboat was unable to sail into Tanggu, the Shoukang Company telegraphed the Ruikang ship again, ordering it to quickly sail back to Dalian. However, the ship was running low on coal, and the crew's food was also running out, making it difficult to sail to Dalian. Even the Tianjin Shipping Company telegraphed back that it could not provide a tow. The company then telegraphed the shipowner, ordering him to sail to Yantai nearby to receive food and other supplies.</p>
<p>Communication Cut Off</p>
<p>By the time the company's third telegram was sent, the ship did not reply. Perhaps the electrical equipment had been damaged and communication was impossible, but the company was very anxious. It was impossible to rescue or supply the ship trapped in the ice. As for whether there were any accidents, it is still difficult to predict at this time. Last night, the company reported the matter to the China Ship Insurance Joint Association and is trying to find a way to rescue the ship.</p>
<p>Yushun Difficult to Return</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Yushun ship has been trapped in ice in Tianjin for over a week. The hull was slightly damaged. After the ship was repaired in Tanggu, a telegram was sent to Shanghai yesterday stating that there were many ice layers in the sea outside Tianjin, making navigation difficult. The Taikoo New Shun Tian and Jardine Matheson's Hesheng ships had ice-breaking equipment and had ventured out yesterday. Seeing this 100-li ice field, the owner of the Yushun ship, Li Yunqu, telegraphed that he still could not risk sailing back to Shanghai because the ship was not as new and sturdy as the British ships, and ice-breaking is extremely dangerous, involving the lives and property of the entire ship. Therefore, it is still trapped in Tanggu.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market in this city saw prices soar in cotton, yarn, and flour due to the Ministry of Finance's issuance of the Unified Public Bonds and the Reconstruction Public Bonds and the closure of the securities market. As a result, general merchants changed their course and engaged in other speculations. Cotton futures for this month rose 3 jiao, March rose 5 jiao, April rose 7 jiao, May rose 7 jiao, June rose 6.5 jiao, and July rose 6.5 jiao. Cotton yarn futures for this month rose 1.6 yuan, March rose 2 yuan, April rose 2.3 yuan, May rose 2 yuan, June rose 1.6 yuan, and July rose 1.9 yuan. Flour for both near and far terms rose 3 to 5 fen. Rice also rose 1.5 to 2 jiao, and wheat also rose about 1 jiao. (Note: Because domestic wheat has been used up, and the wheat market is dominated by foreign wheat, the impact is relatively small.)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Public Announcement from the First Special District City Federation - Supporting the Two New Public Bonds <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of this city issued a special announcement to the citizens in support of the government's issuance of new public bonds. The original text reads: "To all citizens, the central government has decided to issue the Unified and Reconstruction Public Bonds to recall the previously issued public bonds and treasury bills, which is to build the foundation of independent finance. According to finance, there are three methods for consolidating public debt: 1. Issuing new public bonds with lower interest rates or longer terms to recall existing public bonds. 2. Having the government recall at market price. 3. Reducing public bond interest rates. The government's financial difficulties are the difficulties of the people. The government's difficult financial situation will certainly be detrimental to the people. Now the government is following the first method, which is to extend the period to consolidate and unify the original public bonds and to realize Premier Chiang's declaration of making the government a powerful and responsible government. Therefore, this move by the government not only consolidates bonds but also makes finance completely independent, no longer subject to any constraints, and further puts the government in a position of strength and responsibility, allowing economic construction to make significant progress. This is why this federation believes that this is the central government's greatest success in construction after the currency policy and railway plan. All citizens can not but support it. Special announcement."</p>
<h3 id="e94">Second Special District Citizens' Association - Telegraphed Premier Chiang Yesterday - Requesting that the Public Bond Price Be Fixed at 98 - Interest Should Not Exceed 8 Li at Most <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Guomin News Agency reports: Yesterday, the Citizens' Federation of the Second Special District of the French Concession of this city telegraphed Premier Chiang of the Executive Yuan regarding the Ministry of Finance's issuance of new public bonds, requesting that the face value of public bonds be fixed at a price of 98 and that the total interest not exceed 8 li, so that bond credibility can be permanently consolidated. The original telegram reads, "To Premier Chiang of the Executive Yuan of the National Government in Nanjing: Minister Kong has recently decided to issue 146 million yuan of Unified Public Bonds from February 1st of this year to exchange old bonds in order to address the revenue shortfall and financial difficulties and to implement the entire economic recovery policy, and to issue 34 million yuan of Reconstruction Public Bonds to improve the financial organization. This measure is considered essential. However, it is still uncertain whether future social idle funds will return to productive industries and assist the government in its construction plan. Currently, the public bond interest rate appears to be 6%, but in fact, the market price of recent disarmament public bonds and short-term financial public bonds is only 70 yuan in legal tender per 100 yuan bond, which can be purchased, and the interest is still calculated based on the 100 yuan face value. Therefore, including the principal due from the lottery, it can reach more than 1 fen. Because public bonds offer higher benefits, people are very enthusiastic about investing, but they regard other industrial and commercial enterprises as dangerous, causing them to shrink back and creating various panic phenomena in society. Mr. Sun Zhesheng has already mentioned this situation to the Central News Agency reporter on the 2nd of this month and advocated that the 98 price should be used as the legal price of public bonds in the future, so that interest can be limited. The association believes that it is very reasonable to prevent idle funds from concentrating on investing in public bonds, stabilize the securities market and bond prices, the Ministry of Finance should use the bid limit price method to limit the interest on public bonds, regardless of the length of the term, the maximum should not exceed 8 li. If the securities price plus interest exceeds the limited interest rate, the central, Zhong, Jiao, and other national banks should be ordered to maintain it, so that speculation can be strictly prohibited without shaking the market, so that bond credibility can be maintained, and the escape of cash can be curbed. Wild surges and sharp falls not only do not help to save the financial market but also fundamentally hinder the economic recovery policy. Your Excellency manages all affairs and knows the people's suffering. You should forward the decree to the Ministry to limit the face value of public bonds to 98 as the legal price before the exchange of new and old public bonds, and the total interest should not exceed 8 li at most, so that bond credibility can be permanently consolidated, and the economic recovery policy can be completely successful, benefiting the country and the people. Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation, Jiang Yin."</p>

After receiving the order, the banking and money industries associations decided to reduce interest rates, dividing them into two categories: deposits and loans. The prerequisite is to reduce deposit interest rates first, and then loan interest rates can be reduced. Now, Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Banking Association, has returned to Shanghai. According to the Xinsheng News Agency reporter's investigation, the two industry associations have scheduled a joint meeting for tomorrow (Wednesday) to discuss and decide to form a committee to study it.</p>

The money houses that have borrowed money, except for the 7 million yuan borrowed from the Money Industry Reserve and various commercial banks, have repaid it before the general closing. With the permission of the three banks, the 18 million yuan borrowed from the Zhong, Zhong, and Jiao banks is allowed to be repaid after the general closing.

<p>Zhenbei Has Not Yet Emerged from the Shallows: The Zhenbei steamship of the Sanbei Company was transporting goods from Shanghai to Yichang when it ran aground due to low water in the Jiangkou area. This matter was reported in this newspaper. At that time, the company telegraphed the Yichang branch to rescue it and sent the Fuyang ship to tow it. However, due to the heavy ship and shallow water, the ship was stuck and could not be pulled out. Now, a barge has been sent to unload the goods to lighten the ship before attempting another rescue.</p>
<p>Sanxing's Rudder Damaged by Water: The Sanxing steamship of the Sanxing Shipping Company, with a deadweight of 2,470 tons, a length of 286 feet, a width of 39 feet, and a draft of 19 feet, had a Tianjin resident drive the ship when it left Tianjin. The ship was driven to the Jiangshang south of Dazhan. The great cold in Tianjin had not subsided, and there was much ice. The ship's rudder was twisted and broken by the pressure of the ice. A telegram has been sent to Shanghai, and the ship is now docked at Dazhan for repairs.</p>

<p>The First Special District Citizens' United Association believes that the Shanghai Telephone Company of the Special District will implement new, fixed price rates starting March 1st. Their main goal is to charge per call, but given the current economic decline and the fall of many industries, this implementation would be an unbearable burden on citizens. Therefore, a resolution was passed at the standing committee meeting to solicit opinions from all citizens in the city in preparation for a response. They also sent a letter to the Telephone Issue Committee, requesting a joint meeting of all city organizations to discuss solutions. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Distributing Letters to Solicit Citizen Opinions</p>
<p>1.  The First Special District Citizens' United Association, regarding the Special District's telephone change to a per-call billing method, citizens have repeatedly expressed their opposition and have written to the Public Works Department to stop it, but without success. The standing committee meeting resolved that, as the Shanghai Telephone Company has announced it will implement the new rate schedule starting March 1st, in order to unify citizens' opinions and prepare for a response, a notice was specially printed yesterday and distributed to sub-district branches, requesting citizens to fill it out and submit it to the association for consideration. The content of the opinion form includes: Name, Occupation, Address, Business Name, Business Address, Amount of Property Tax Paid, Whether or not a Telephone is Installed, Whether a Business or Residential Telephone is Installed, Telephone Number, Average Number of Daily Calls, Ability to Remove the Telephone, Accuracy of the Calculation of the Usual Number of Calls to the City, Opinions on the New Rate Schedule, Ability to Express Agreement When Necessary.</p>
<p>Sending a Letter to the Telephone Committee for Serious Negotiations</p>
<p>The association also sent a letter to the Special District Telephone Issue Committee regarding the telephone rate increase, requesting serious negotiations with the Public Works Department and the Board of Directors, and promptly convening a joint meeting of representatives from all city organizations to discuss solutions. The original letter stated: "Dear Sirs, regarding the Shanghai Telephone Company's rate increase, our association has written to the Public Works Department to find a way to stop it, but without success. Subsequently, all city organizations formed your esteemed committee to seek collective wisdom and strength to respond to it in a unified way. Previously, we read in the newspaper that your esteemed committee sent representatives to negotiate with the Public Works Department and proposed three solutions, but the bureau ignored the public opinion of taxpayers and rejected the requests, resulting in no results. Our association has resolved at the joint meeting of supervisors and directors that, in addition to distributing letters to various district branches to solicit citizens' opinions, we are also writing to your esteemed committee to request that you promptly convene a meeting of representatives from all city organizations to discuss solutions. This matter is of great importance. We await your reply for guidance. Sincerely, to the Special District Telephone Issue Committee."</p>
<h3 id="e103">Shanghai Telephone Company Claims Per-Call Billing Has Two Major Benefits <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to news from the Shanghai Telephone Company, the Shanghai telephone network was completely converted to automatic dialing in March 1932, and its efficiency is comparable to the most modern cities in the world. Calculating calls by the number of times has two major benefits: 1. For fees, it is determined by the amount of use by the user, which is the fairest method. This fee principle is the same as the fee methods of other public utilities in Shanghai. That is, each user is based on the amount of consumption as a unit. The number of calls by local users is recorded by an electric machine, which is very accurate. Each user's line is connected to a counter. The recording of this meter must wait until the caller's line is connected to the receiver's line and an answer is received before the call record is recorded on the caller's meter. Also, there is no charge for incoming calls. If the dialed number is in use or there is no answer, the call will not be recorded. There is no charge for dialing company departments (94090) or the telephone code inquiry office (09) repair office (01) and emergency calls (00). 6. The implementation of this per-call calculation can place telephone rates on a solid foundation and further expand the Shanghai telephone network, increasing its value for serving citywide users. This new rate can indeed gradually expand the effect of this extremely great invention in the world and benefit the entire society. Anyone who knows the convenience of automatic telephones rarely still wants to adopt the old-fashioned manual switchboard method. The per-call billing method is also the same. According to the experience of major cities in the world, all those who have abolished the old method of telephone billing per household all know that once Shanghai switches to the new per-call rate, it will definitely be recognized as the most novel, fairest, and most progressive way to charge.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Legislative Yuan to urge the implementation of the Commercial Registration Law, stating: "To the esteemed Legislative Yuan in Nanjing: Since October of the 23rd year, legislators of your esteemed Yuan have adopted the opinions of merchants nationwide, and after drafting the Commercial Registration Law and stipulating the method of shared liability for partnerships, although it has undergone a preliminary review once, due to differing opinions among the Yuan's committee members, the matter has been delayed without resolution. Our association sent telegrams twice on March 2nd and April 16th of the 24th year, requesting your esteemed Yuan to submit the law to the Yuan for discussion and implementation as soon as possible. The secretariat of your esteemed Yuan replied twice, stating that the president of the Yuan had approved the matter for reference by the Civil Law and Commercial Law committees, but now more than a year has passed, and there is still no news of a resolution for implementation. At a time when the city's commerce is extremely declining and debt disputes are constantly arising, those who are willing fear being implicated in joint and several liability, and their assets are insufficient to repay, so they dare not step forward to assume their responsible portion, only making the accounts even more difficult to collect, further increasing the city's devastation, and making it even less likely that new partnership businesses will be initiated. Our association has repeatedly received the aforementioned appeals from various industries throughout the year, with requests for this matter almost filling an inch, and it is not appropriate to continue to bother you, but the case has been shelved for too long, and we cannot remain silent in the end. Therefore, we sincerely and earnestly request your esteemed Yuan to review and approve our request and resolve to implement the law as soon as possible for the public convenience. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully kowtows."</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports that since the Finance Bureau improved the property tax collection system, each tax collection office has strived for simple and convenient procedures for receipts for those who pay property tax themselves. Taxpayers can fill out an immediate payment order payable to the Finance Bureau at any bank in the city, write "Payable to the Shanghai Municipal Bank" with two diagonal lines in between, and mail it directly to the tax collection office. After each tax collection office receives the check and verifies it, it will send the tax receipt to the household within three days. The method is very reliable and convenient for citizens. The bureau issued a notice yesterday, setting February 3rd as the start date for collecting spring property tax. Those whose tax amount is over ten yuan should bring their notice and pay at the tax collection office in charge within fifteen days from the start date. Those who still have not submitted and paid the tax after ten days will be collected door-to-door by the tax collection office and charged according to the regulations. The vehicle tax office set up by the bureau at the Wusong City Ferry Terminal will collect property taxes for the city of Wusong, and the Jiangwan Land Tax Collection Office of the bureau will collect property taxes for the Jiangwan district to facilitate collection.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Joint Announcement by Frozen and Cotton Cloth Associations; Change in Business Strategy; Weaving and Dyeing Industry Announces Price Increase <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>New Life News Agency reports that due to the sluggish market, the frozen fish and cotton cloth industries have announced changes in their business strategies. The machine dyeing and weaving industry has also announced a price increase. Details are summarized below:</p>
<p>Frozen Fish: The Frozen Fish Industry Association announced: "Dear Sirs, the market has been bad for years, causing members to suffer quite a bit. If we don't rectify the situation, we will collapse completely. With this in mind, this association has to seek relief. The outside world does not understand the truth and believes that this industry is oppressing fishermen and extracting unexpected profits, so we specially convened a meeting to discuss remedies and rectification methods, which were unanimously decided as follows. We hope that our members will conscientiously follow these procedures. If there is chaos, we will submit a report to the superiors to establish offices and hope that all relevant parties will pay attention: 1. Large Boat Commission: Those with business capital are calculated at 99% and 92%; those without business capital are calculated at 99% and 93%. 2. Abolish Bad Customs: All expenses originally returned to boat households, such as pole pushing, rudder pulling, flower inserting, cloth folding, wheel transportation, guest towels, wine discounts, and meal discounts, are all abolished, but each boat will be supplied with 20 lanterns each time by the fish store selling them. 3. Vendor Account Settlement: Vendors must buy and receive goods daily, and settle accounts every five or ten days. If accounts are not settled by the due date, a report can be made to this association, and this association will notify member stores to stop selling on credit and pay in cash only (checks not accepted). 4. Guest Helper and Water Carrier Account Settlement: Water carriers for goods coming and going to this street, guest helpers, and dried goods must settle accounts at the end of the month, large and small, and payment is limited to legal tender, universal Zhuang bills (checks not accepted)."</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: The Cotton Cloth Association announced: "It is found that Article 12 of the industry regulations stipulates that 'The payment for goods dismantled by the same industry in this port is due on the 8th of each month for the first installment and the 23rd of each month for the second installment. The first installment is due by the middle of the next month, and the second installment is due by the end of the month. All payments must be cleared by the due date.' Article 13 stipulates that 'Payment for goods dismantled by the same industry in this port must be paid in full in cash or 10-day Zhuang bills. Checks and promissory notes must not be accepted.' All members of the dismantling industry should abide by these regulations. In order to prevent sabotage, this association convened a meeting of the dismantling group yesterday and decided that in addition to having this association re-register the above two industry regulations in the Shen Bao and Xin Bao and announce them for the attention of customers, it will also issue another notice to all dismantling industry members to strictly abide by them. If there is any private sabotage, punishment will be imposed according to the regulations. This is a special announcement, and it is hoped that all customers will take note and comply."</p>
<p>Machine Dyeing: The Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association announced a price increase: "Dear Sirs, the dyeing factory group in this industry has recently experienced soaring prices for caustic soda, chemicals, coal, and various raw materials. If we do not moderately increase prices for all products, we will not be able to maintain our capital. After a meeting of the industry association, it was decided that starting February 1st, the method of increasing dyeing prices will be as follows: 1. Original color: Increase the original price by 15% per piece. 2. Colors: Increase the original price by 20% per piece. 3. Indanthrene and other non-fading dyes: Increase the original price by 30% per piece. In addition to notifying all industry members to comply uniformly, we also hope that all customers will appreciate the original situation."</p>

<p>The Central Savings Society, established by the Central Trust Bureau, has been actively preparing and will soon open. It is now learned that in order to protect the interests of depositors, the society has specially organized a supervisory committee to supervise the safe use of the society's investments.

Because the above people are well-known figures in the domestic financial world and people with rich experience in handling savings, they are responsible for supervising the funds and savings of the Central Savings Society to ensure that the safest investments are adopted and are not affected by any political and economic changes. In the future, the supervisory committee, together with the supervisors of the Central Trust Bureau and representatives of depositors, will also draw lots on site at the monthly lottery to ensure fairness. Therefore, the interests of the society's depositors can be effectively guaranteed.</p>

(This time to handle factory registration) After investigation, the authorities believe that improving industry is very important and is related to national economy and people's livelihood. If compliance is delayed, the impact will be not small, so it is stipulated that for factories that are not registered, if they apply for patents, tax exemptions, tax reductions, or dispute mediation, etc., they will not be responsible. This is a special announcement, and it is hoped that all members will abide by government laws and register immediately. Please do not delay."</p>

<p>The work of the Municipal Public Security Bureau to check public places in the city began gradually last month. The checking work in Nanshi ended a few days ago (31st). In order to continue checking, the bureau dispatched multiple checkers to Zhabei District from the previous day (1st) to check daily in the jurisdiction of the North Railway Station Branch of the Public Security Bureau, the North Sichuan Road Police Station, the Yongxing Road Police Station, and the Linping Road Police Station. The work was very tense every day and will end at the end of the month. Also, the Stamp Inspection Office of the bureau stopped working due to the end of the old lunar year and the period for summing up accounts in various industries. Now that the old lunar year is over, it will start continuing inspections from the 10th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Public Security Bureau Announces That Hospitals and Doctors Should Submit Survey Forms for Smoking Cessation Work <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports that the Municipal Public Security Bureau announced: "Since the city has strictly enforced the ban on smoking, smokers throughout the city have gradually become aware of the strictness of the law and have woken up to the fact that many are willing to voluntarily quit smoking. In addition to the smokers who have applied to be sent to the Municipal Hunan and Hubei Smoking Cessation Hospitals for free treatment, of which there are detailed statistics, the number of people who pay fees to quit smoking at various public and private hospitals and Chinese and Western doctors is still unknown to this bureau and needs to be investigated and added to the statistics. The Shanghai City Public and Private Medical Hygiene Bureau previously formulated a form and forwarded it, setting a deadline for submission. This is to further inform all public and private hospitals and Chinese and Western doctors that if they have not received the form, they must quickly come to this bureau or send a letter to the Fourth Section of this bureau to request the form, fill it out separately, and report it. Based on the report, this bureau will review and handle the smoking cessation results. Those who have excellent smoking cessation results will be sent a letter to the Health Bureau recommending them as formal places for smokers to pay fees to quit smoking, or a report will be submitted to the Municipal Government for approval to give a certificate of commendation to encourage them. Please do not delay. This is a special announcement."</p>
<h3 id="e116">French Police Rescue Vegetable Market Stallholders <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Recently, lawsuits have occurred frequently in the Second Special District Local Court due to vegetable market stall permits. Therefore, the French Concession Patrol Police dispatched Western staff members a few days ago to strictly investigate the permits of each vegetable market, inquiring in detail about the names, addresses, etc., of the permit holders. If the information was found to be inconsistent with the information provided at the time of registration, the permit would be temporarily detained for correction. However, there will be no punishment for permits with discrepancies in origin at this time. It is found that the act of transferring and renting out permits violates Article 3 of the vegetable market regulations. Once this case is registered, the French authorities will file a lawsuit against those who have engaged in fraudulent conduct or who are unwilling to change the permits according to the regulations. The French Concession authorities' actions are entirely for the benefit of legitimate merchants, as these merchants are now being forced by rogues to pay rent monthly to satisfy selfish desires. Currently, about 50 stallholders at the Ningxing vegetable market have submitted their permits to the French Police Station, requesting corrections. After this legitimate procedure, the stallholders will be able to eliminate their monthly losses of several yuan that they are being forced to pay. Therefore, in the future, any stallholders who suffer losses due to being introduced by intermediaries can report the process to the police station, and there will be considerable protection.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Gu Zhuxuan Case to Resume Hearing Today; Will Not Be Consolidated with Wang Xinggao Case <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>After Tang Jiapeng, the Ningbo manager of the former Great World Amusement Park, was assassinated in front of the Great World on June 18, 1933, Wang Xinggao of Funing, the instigator of the murder, and Gu Zhuxuan of Yancheng, the owner of the Tianchan Stage, were informed by Zhao Guangfu of Yangzhou, the criminal who was sentenced to life imprisonment, one after another to the French Police Department. Chinese and Western detectives arrested Wang Xinggao and brought him to the Special Second Court for prosecution. After questioning, he was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for life. Wang appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. On September 10 of the previous year, the French Police Department sent detectives to arrest Gu Zhuxuan and sent him to the Special Second Court. The Police Department filed a public prosecution against him for the crime of instigating murder. At the end of the trial, Gu was sentenced to 15 years in prison and 10 years of deprivation of civil rights. Gu also appealed the judgment to the Third Branch of the High Court. After accepting the two cases, the Third Branch of the High Court repeatedly opened a collegiate court to investigate Wang's case. Because the case was complicated and the investigation took time, it has not yet concluded. For Gu's case, a collegiate investigation court was opened once and resolved. Because the case was important, Judge Wang Yue, who was in charge of the case, opened two more investigation courts and summoned lawyer Zhu Dianqing and Zheng Chen Shulin, the wife of Zheng Rongsheng, who was assassinated and killed two months before Tang Jiapeng in the same year, to investigate the details. This has been reported in the previous newspapers. It is learned that the Second Branch of the High Court has scheduled a collegiate court to continue the hearing of Wang and Gu's appeal cases today. Wang's case will be heard in the Third Court at 10:00 AM, and Gu's case will be heard in the First Court at 2:00 PM. Therefore, the rumors that the High Court will consolidate the two cases for hearing due to their connection are not true.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 20th of last month, a fire broke out in the machinery room of the East District Branch of the Shanghai Electric Power Company at the intersection of Qiwupu Road and Yangshupu Road in Yangshupu. The police and fire brigade rushed to the rescue after hearing the news. However, the electric current and flames intensified together, causing the fire to become more intense and violent. Many firefighters, detectives, and workers were burned on the spot. At that time, Mao Deng, the deputy chief of the fire brigade, bravely took the lead and was seriously injured. He later died in the hospital due to his injuries. Yesterday was the day of Mao's funeral. Important officials from the Public Works Department, police and fire brigade personnel, and representatives from local Chinese fire brigades attended the funeral. There were also many elegiac couplets, expressing sympathy. The road out of Jing'an Temple Road was blocked by spectators. Mao left behind a widow, brothers, and sisters. Yesterday, Mr. Zhong Si, Director-General of the Public Works Department, sent a letter to Mrs. Mao Deng, expressing his condolences for Mao's death. He highly praised Mao's fearlessness in the face of danger and his diligence in his duties.</p>

Both will be sent back to the United States to be imprisoned at the McNeil Island Correctional Institution near Seattle, Washington, or other correctional institutions. It is heard that the lawyers representing both men will file an appeal within the next few days. Mr. Fan Keling, Bai Lang's lawyer, said that he believes Lei Wen can win the appeal to the Court of Appeals in San Francisco in the future, but Bai Lang is not very confident. At the same time, Lei Wen and Bai Lang will remain in custody in Ward Road Prison. Before the final verdict yesterday morning, although Lei Wen was in court, he was unable to enter the dock to testify due to illness. A written testimony was read in court by his lawyer, stating that he never knew or deliberately violated the law. After reading, Chief Judge Hillmike announced the verdict and asked Bai Lang if he had anything to say. Bai Lang stood up and replied that he had nothing to say. Thereupon the court was adjourned, and Lei Wen and Bai Lang were returned to Ward Road Prison. It is heard that both will be treated the same as other American criminals. Although the prison cells have bathtubs, they only have cold water showers.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Jin Establishes Pleasure Quarters in Both Hangzhou and Shanghai, Divorce Mediation Fails <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Former Land Bureau Director of this city, Jin Liren, from Anhui province, remarried Lu Canjuan, a woman from Suzhou, as his second wife thirty years ago, after the death of his first wife. At the time, Lu was a famous prostitute in Shanghai, known as Zhu Xueqing, on par with the "Four Great Diamonds" like Lin Daiyu. Since their marriage, they have lived together for over thirty years in a self-built five-story Western-style building at 302 Baker Road. Now that Lu is fifty-one years old and her beauty has faded, Jin has become involved with a Cantonese woman named Mai Peizhen, building a lavish Western-style house by the West Lake in Hangzhou as a place to hide her. Recently, Jin has become infatuated with a certain dance hostess, cohabiting with her in a self-built residence in the city center, neglecting his wife Lu Canjuan, and failing to provide her with any living expenses for over five months. Lu believes that Jin Liren's behavior makes it impossible for them to stay together, so she has hired lawyer Ling Qihong to handle her divorce from Jin. To make Jin aware of the situation, she first filed a petition for mediation with the First Special District Court's mediation office, seeking a divorce from Jin and the payment of 60,000 yuan in alimony, as well as a substantial dowry, as Lu had considerable savings when she married Jin, and therefore had a very rich dowry. The court accepted the petition, and on the morning of yesterday, Judge Chen Shuoying convened the tenth civil court to summon the parties for mediation. The respondent, Jin Liren, hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Wu Bintai, who raised the issue of jurisdiction, stating that Jin currently resides at 37 Minzhuang Road in the city center, and the petitioner's request should be made to the District Court. Furthermore, the respondent claimed that he was unable to pay the 60,000 yuan in alimony requested by the petitioner. Judge Chen, finding that mediation could not be achieved, declared the mediation unsuccessful and ordered that a formal lawsuit be filed.</p>

<p>On the 1st of this month at 1 AM, a middle-aged man calling himself Zhao Junming, a local, accompanied a young woman claiming to be Mrs. Zhu, arrived at the Anshang Inn at 37 Baliqiao Street in the French Concession, renting room 54 for the night. Zhao murdered Mrs. Zhu, stabbing her in vital points until she died. He then escaped. The crime was discovered by the tea server Chen Jinyu, who reported it to the French police, who transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuantang branch autopsy facility to await examination. The police also took the letters left behind by the murderer and the deceased's belongings, clothing, and gold ring back to the police station, ordering an investigation and arrest of the perpetrator, as reported in the newspapers on both occasions. However, until yesterday, no one had come forward to identify the deceased. Yesterday, the French police, according to the Zhu name registered in the inn's record book, reported to the Second Special District Court Prosecutor's Office, which appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren, along with forensic doctor Jiang, clerk Zhao Yifen, and others, to the facility at 11 AM to examine the body, and take a seat on the judicial panel. First, a detective reported on the investigation since the incident, and presented the deceased's belongings, clothing, gold ring, and the murderer's letters, and the murder weapon to the case. The owner of the Anshang Inn, Zhang Baofa, who had been summoned as a witness, did not appear, only the tea server Chen Jinyu appeared. According to Chen, when he discovered the crime, the deceased's head was covered with an undershirt, and he detailed the discovery of the deceased's murder and the arrival of the two at the inn. Then, the detectives opened a package of the deceased's clothes, presenting each item for inspection. Prosecutor Wang Ren then ordered an examination, determining that Mrs. Zhu had died from stab wounds inflicted by a bladed weapon. The body was to be coffined and buried by Tongren Fuyuantang, and the police department was ordered to strictly investigate the perpetrator, arrest him, and bring him to justice. The murder weapon and letters were to be confiscated. The detectives were instructed to take the deceased's belongings back to the police station, to carefully assess the weight, purity, and value of the gold ring, and to create a detailed list of the clothing, before sending them to the court treasury for safekeeping pending claim. After the examination, the body was placed in a coffin by the Tongren Fuyuantang branch and transported to the cemetery for burial, pending identification of relatives. The French police, in addition to ordering all detectives on duty to strictly investigate the fugitive perpetrator, also consulted the Public Concession Police and the Shanghai Municipal Police Department to assist in the investigation, to prevent the perpetrator from escaping justice, and to ensure his arrest and full punishment under the law.</p>

<p>At approximately 10 AM the day before yesterday, Luo Siwei, a patrol officer from the Zhabei Xinzha sub-bureau Wuzhen Road police station, along with other officers, was inspecting pedestrians at the intersection of Wuzhen Road and Xinjiang Road when they encountered a man who appeared flustered. Officer Luo immediately searched him and found parts of a handgun wrapped in white paper. When questioned about the origin of the parts, he refused to disclose the truth. Later, it was discovered that he was having them repaired at a certain coppersmith shop, stating that the repair cost was 2.4 yuan. The shop owner, knowing that the items were contraband, stated that they required written permission before he could make the repairs. Unfortunately for the suspect, the police station discovered his plan. After being taken to the station, the suspect confessed his name was Zhu Ada, 36 years old, from Wuxi, living in a shack in Caojiadu, and that he had a total of three handguns. One was at his stepmother's house in Wuxi, another was at his friend Qian Yunsheng's place in Caojiadu, and the gun being repaired was at his accomplice Chen Baokang's house. He also confessed to having committed five robbery cases: One in Dachang in February last year, one at the Sun Temple in March, one at a nunnery in Beixinjing in April, one outside the south gate of Wuxi in July, and one at a cigarette paper shop on Tokyo Road in this city. His accomplices were Wang A'er, Qian Yunsheng, Kang Xiaolinsheng, and others, all living in the Caojiadu area. After obtaining the confession, Officer Luo immediately reported to Liao Jiongran, the director of the Xinzha sub-bureau, who dispatched detectives Zhu Jinrong, Sun Youzhi, and Zhang Shuwen. Officer Luo, along with officers Hu Yao, Hu Maokui, Wu Dengxin, Hu Kuizhao, and others, over ten in total, met with officers Gu Zhengping, Wu Tianxi, and Wang Shuqing from the Caojiadu sub-bureau.</p>
<p>Late that night, they arrested Wang A'er, 30 years old, from Changzhou, living at 4 Hexing Lane on Roberts Road; Xing Quanrong, 28 years old, local; Ye Gensheng, 35 years old, from Pudong; and Wang Yinsheng, 31 years old, from Changshu.

A total of twelve people were arrested. Some were only suspected of being involved, but Wang A'er had confessed to committing over eight robberies. The thieves were taken to the station by Officer Luo yesterday morning at around 10 AM, along with the confiscated handgun and bullets, and sent to the Xinzha sub-bureau for interrogation. It was also learned that the thieves had confessed that they planned to rob the Sui Feng Rice Shop north of the Wuzhen Road Bridge on February 11th, after the handgun was repaired. They had been surveying the area while they took the gun to be repaired the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Wu Tieqing Accused of Adultery Case Not Accepted, Due to Improper Prosecution Procedures, Agent May Not Independently Sue.</p>
<p>Wu Yaoting, a gold business tycoon and compradore at the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank from Suzhou, possessed substantial wealth. Recently, as Wu was getting old, all his businesses were taken over by his eldest son, Wu Ruiqing. Wu's youngest son, Tieqing, was born from a concubine who had left Wu. He had always been unusually pampered. Recently, Tieqing was sued in the First Special District Court by Zhou Hong, a woman from Shaoxing (resident of 28 Rongyang Lane, Meadow House Road), who hired lawyers such as Cai Xiaobai, accusing him of adultery with her daughter, Zhou Beilei (also known as Peilan, 16 years old, a student at a Shanghai western-style primary school). The First Special District Court had previously summoned Wu Tieqing once, but the hearing was rescheduled because Wu Tieqing did not appear. All of this information has been published in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui convened the eighth criminal court to continue the hearing, and both parties appeared in court. Judge Liu questioned Zhou Hong whether she was suing on behalf of Zhou Beilei or independently. She replied that she was suing independently. Judge Liu then questioned Zhou Beilei, who stated that she had met Wu Tieqing four years ago and was seduced and raped in room 816 of the Yangtze Hotel on September 30th of last year. Her lawyers presented two letters from Wu as evidence. When questioned, Wu Tieqing stated that he lived at 270 Hulong Street, Suzhou, that he knew Miss Zhou, but had no relationship with her, and that the room at the Yangtze Hotel was opened by his friend Zhou Dingliang. He admitted that the letters presented by the plaintiff were written by him. Judge Liu reviewed the testimonies and stated that there were still procedural issues with the case. According to the Judicial Yuan's interpretation on the 10th of last month, legal representatives may not independently file private prosecutions. Therefore, the plaintiff should request the police to file a public prosecution or seek damages in a civil lawsuit for redress. The plaintiff's lawyers requested that Wu Tieqing be released on bail because he did not have a fixed residence. The defendant's lawyer, Kong Zhaozhang, objected. Judge Liu then ruled that the case was not accepted, and the defendant did not need to post bail.</p>

<p>Chen Junsheng, a Fujianese man residing at 136 Papillon Road, French Concession, is 28 years old and works as a band leader at the Adowa Dance Hall on Avenue Edward VII. On the 16th of last month, he reported to the French Police that around 7 PM, several strangers broke into his house while he was out and forcibly took away a sewing machine worth 60 yuan, requesting an investigation. The police chief approved the request and ordered Detective Wu Yuren to investigate. Wu arrested Chen Linjiang, the main culprit, a 33-year-old local, residing at 75 Route Doumer, who owned a dairy shop. Chen Linjiang confessed to having an accomplice, Lu A'si, 25 years old, local, residing at 101 McTaggart Road, who was also arrested. The original stolen item was recovered from a pawnshop on Route Amiral de Horsey and sent to the Second Special District Court, where they were released on bail pending further investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Pusheng of the Second District Court continued the hearing in the eighth criminal court. The defendants appeared in court on time. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi explained the case, accusing the defendants of theft under Article 320 of the Criminal Code. The plaintiff, Chen Junsheng, stated that he worked as a band leader at the Adowa Dance Hall, and the owner of the dance hall was unable to pay the merchants' salaries, so he voluntarily handed over the dance hall to the merchants for five days, with the income used to offset the salaries owed. However, the subsequent income was not enough to cover the amount owed, and the dance hall also owed the dance hostesses a considerable amount of salary. The dance hostesses believed that the income received by the merchants and the money owed to them were related, so they demanded payment from the merchants, who ignored them. As a result, several people, including the defendants, went to his house and forcibly took away the sewing machine to pawn it. He only found out after his wife called him and reported it to the police, requesting an investigation. When questioned, the defendant Chen Linjiang stated that he was invited by the dance hostess Wu Lina to ask Lu A'si, Song Hehai, and others to go to the plaintiff to demand the dance fees owed. The plaintiff voluntarily brought out the sewing machine to pawn it, obtaining eight yuan, which was given to Wu Lina. He did not steal it. Lu A'si's testimony was the same as Chen Linjiang's. The witness, dance hostess Wu Lina, also testified that she had indeed asked Chen Linjiang and other patrons to go and demand the money owed, and that the plaintiff voluntarily handed over the sewing machine to Chen and others to pawn for eight yuan, which was given to the dance hostess. The police lawyer argued that when the defendants went to take the sewing machine, the plaintiff was present and aware of the situation, and the defendants did not commit a criminal offense. It was already clarified in court that the defendants were unrelated to this case, so why would they go to such lengths? They only wanted to please the dance hostesses, to be the hero of the hour, and disregard the consequences. They should be judged according to the law. The defendants were also defended by their lawyers. The court then declared the conclusion of the case, finding both defendants not guilty. During the appeal period, they were still ordered to provide their original bail for notification.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Alumni of Peking University in Shanghai Celebrate Cai Zimin's Birthday <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai alumni of Peking University, including Zhai Junqian, Xu Yannian, Guo Zhishi, Dong Xiaoyi, He Dekui, Li Dachao, Lin Gengbai, Lei Guoxiong, Xu Yiheng, Lin Xinru, Lin Yannan, and more than fifty others, celebrated the 70th birthday of former Peking University president and current president of the Academia Sinica, Cai Yuanpei, at the Cangzhou Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road the day before yesterday (the 1st) at 6:30 PM. Former Peking University professor and current president of Jinan University, He Bingsong, and president of the National Conservatory of Music, Xiao Youmei, were also invited. Li Dachao chaired the event, and Zhai Junqian gave a birthday speech. Mr. Cai recounted his experiences at Peking University and encouraged the students. President He, President Xu, Lin Kangbai, Lei Guoxiong, and other students delivered speeches and presented a birthday screen. The preface to the screen is as follows: Preface to the 70th Birthday Celebration of Mr. Cai Zimin and Madam Zhou. On the 17th day of the 12th lunar month of the 24th year of the Republic of China, our nation is worried about its eastern neighbor. Mr. Cai Zimin is now 70 years old. Throughout history, both in China and abroad, when a nation and its people are in times of hardship and suffering, there must be something to maintain their vitality and prevent them from falling. This is not only the responsibility of the educated elite, but also of the common people who encourage each other. If the elders of the nation act as role models, this last remaining trace of energy will fill the universe, and other races will not be able to encroach upon it. Bismarck's revival of Germany at the age of 70 is a clear example of this. Since the founding of the Republic of China, foreign threats have been increasing, and the educated elite have become extravagant and the people have become lazy and negligent. This is how we have invited foreign invaders. Mr. Zimin passed the imperial examinations early in his life. When the Qing Dynasty was collapsing, Mr. Cai was able to abandon the prestigious position of Hanlin, which was valued by ordinary people, and travel to Europe to seek new knowledge and advocate for revolution, leading the way for the country. He was one of the few among his peers to do so. After the founding of the Republic of China, at the invitation of President Sun Zhongshan, he became the first Minister of Education, removing the old and establishing the new in an orderly manner. Even those in opposing parties praised his wisdom and greatness. Even treacherous figures like Yuan Shikai and Xu Shichang treated him with respect. It is clear that Mr. Cai's virtue and reputation were enough to discipline the stubborn and encourage the cowardly, and he was not only valued by the nation for his accomplishments and knowledge. After being reappointed as president of National Peking University, he devoted himself to reform for more than ten years. Those with shallow understanding were fearful, but in recent times, the improvement of customs and the growth of culture in China, as well as the ultimate success of the revolution, were largely due to Mr. Cai's efforts, which were no less than those of Sun Zhongshan. Sun devoted himself to the world with great benevolence, wisdom, and courage. Mr. Cai was calm and quiet, subtly influencing the educated elite and the common people without their awareness. Without Sun, Mr. Cai's aspirations could not have been realized, and without Mr. Cai, Sun's greatness could not have been manifested. When the Nationalist Government established its capital in Nanjing, it appointed Mr. Cai as the president of the University Council, and later as the Minister of Education. Mr. Cai then served as the president of the Supervisory Yuan. In 1931, when the government was reorganized, Mr. Cai retired as the president of the Academia Sinica, a position he holds to this day. His eldest son, Wu Jizi, and his daughter, William, both from his first marriage, are pure and beautiful in their scholarship and conduct, and have both earned praise. Wu Jizi is currently the director of the Bureau of Commodity Inspection of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and is also known for his sound management of affairs. After marrying Madam Zhou, she gave birth to several children, all of whom are intelligent and outstanding. Madam Zhou comes from a school and has a thorough knowledge of both traditional and modern learning. Within the family, she is gentle and harmonious. Those who celebrate birthdays often do so with extravagance and ostentation, highlighting their achievements and picking up on minor details to honor the elders. Those who are familiar with them often repeat the same clichés. We do not dare to pollute ourselves with this. We can only highlight his great, far-reaching, and immortal achievements. Celebrating Mr. Cai's birthday is also celebrating our party and our nation. The neighbor's invasion has not yet ended, and the divine land is about to be occupied. I believe that to dispel the fear of the thousands of years of decline of the Eastern sick man, we must place our hopes on Mr. Cai, who is the key to the vitality of the nation and the people. We, his students, have entrusted ourselves to his care and have received his teachings. The relationship between Mr. Cai and us is like that between a father and his sons. Therefore, we do not want to celebrate Mr. Cai's birthday with common customs and clichés, but rather quote the words of the sages, "The nation has a gentleman, and only the benevolent live long." We hope that Mr. Cai will make even greater contributions to the troubled and unstable nation and people, so that the vitality of the nation and the people may be sustained and strengthened by Mr. Cai's longevity. Then, who else but Mr. Cai could be the Bismarck of the Republic of China? Although the times and circumstances are different, they all share the same goal of promoting the welfare of the nation and the people. We, his humble students, are willing to hold the reins for him. Students Zhai Junqian, Han Juemin, Wang Xiaotong, Wu Shulin, Jiang Zhensan, Cui Zhuxi, Cui Xiaocen, Xu Yannian, Liang Yuandong, Huang Shijie, Zhang Tiemin, Lei Guoxiong, Li Bojia, Huang Qingzhong, Xu Yiheng, Li Dachao, Han Yuansheng, Dai Yuheng, Ma Zanming, Zeng Jie, He Da'an, Song Kongxian, Xia Anxiu, Xu Jichao, Guo Zhishi, Hu Xueyuan, Duan Yuxue, Chen Jilie, Xi Jiming, Luo Shaozhai, Chen Qiting, Zhu Yiwu, Chu Baohua, Li Zezhang, Zhou Shouliang, Lin Gangbo, Wang Xiaowen, Zhaoqi, Tao Boxun, Yu Youren, Lü Bingshui, Yu Wenwei, Li Xiaofeng, Lin Tingxu, Chen Guoliang, He Dekui, Gong Baoquan, Dong Yi, Lin Xijie, Chu Baoheng, Chu Baoshi, Chu Baole, He Shizhen, He Shimei, Situ De, Yang Liang, Li Qiufan, Ding Yiren, Yang Zhuangfei, Wu Zongshou, Tan Boying, Gu Junyi, Ouyang Banghua, Fu Rulin, Liu Guozeng, Xu Jinglu, Zhang Zeyao, Ma Zhongwu, Qi Xiangrong, Yang Zhaonu, Mei Shuzeng, Xu Shihao, Zhang Guangtian, Liu Tiya, Lin Yannan, Sun Bao, Lin Zhaofen, Lin Gengbai, Chen Hongfan, Chen Derong, Gong Jinfu, Dong Zhongxing, Chen Zhong, Su Xichang, Hu Xueyuan, Sen Zhesheng, Cheng Kexian, offer our congratulations. Auspicious day in the first month of the 25th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Dyeing Industry Association Decides to Adopt the Metric System at General Meeting <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry Association of this city, in order to abolish the use of "ma" and "fen" for silk fabrics and implement the new system of weights and measures, convened a general meeting yesterday to discuss the matter of pricing dyed silk fabrics in meters instead of the current practice of using "chi." The meeting was held after the Fine Refining Industry Association sent a letter requesting cooperation. Chairman Pan Jiaming reported and then presented the matter for discussion. The resolution was passed that "starting from the next year, all dyed artificial silk and mixed silk fabrics shall be priced in meters instead of "ma" and "fen." Pure silk fabrics such as silk crepe shall still be priced according to the old practices, with a reasonable price increase." After the adoption of the metric system, all existing dyeing prices will be abolished, and new prices will be set. The meeting appointed Tan Borong, Sheng Xingqing, Pan Jiaming, Wang Jisheng, and fifteen others as members of the price revision committee, to immediately begin revising the prices. The pricing standards will focus on adapting to current trends and the socio-economic environment, in order to implement a fair pricing policy. The meeting also discussed the practice of using "running street" (paojie) salesmen by various businesses. It was agreed that strict screening should be implemented, as "running street" salesmen are often self-serving, seeking to dye fabrics indiscriminately, disregarding the factory's raw material costs, overstepping their authority and setting prices too low, hoping to profit from the commission, causing the factory to lose money and even go bankrupt. This practice has been deemed detrimental, and it was decided to ban it in order to maintain business operations.</p>
<p>The Gaoming Native Place Association of Shanghai held a spring banquet last night at the Guanzhen Restaurant on Wuchang Road.

After drinking, Cui Canghai, a 73-year-old, former Councilor Luo Xiaofeng, and Mai Xiaocang, a teacher at Guangong Middle School, gave speeches, mostly encouraging mutual assistance among fellow villagers. They discussed purchasing a burial ground and implementing compulsory education as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Liu Shaoqing, a native of Anhui residing at No. 13 Huabao Lane, Route Lagrene, in the French Concession, is 42 years old. He previously worked as a detective in the Chinese territory and is now an investigator at the Sulfur Bureau. His daughter, Xiu Ying, is 20 years old.

This led to an argument, and the daughter, in a moment of despair, secretly bought raw opium and swallowed it at home. At 10 PM, her mother discovered her and sent her to Baolong Hospital. However, due to severe poisoning, she died at 1:30 AM. The hospital notified the police, who dispatched detectives to investigate. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Morgue for autopsy.

<h3 id="e136">Mi Jingshen's Lawsuit Against Huang Xianyao Still Awaits Summoned Witnesses <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Mi Jingshen, a lawyer from Hangzhou who previously practiced law in this city, has recently retained Wang Shizong and other lawyers to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court against Huang Xianyao, the adopted son of the late Huang Chu Jiu, for defamation. The case stems from a dispute over a 100,000 yuan promissory note between Huang and his father-in-law, Zhou Songqing, amidst a criminal case initiated by the creditors of the Gongfa Company against both father-in-law and son-in-law for destruction of evidence. Zhou filed a lawsuit with the French Concession Police against Huang Xianyao for forgery, leading to a public prosecution. Huang testified in the public prosecution court that the promissory note was forged by Mi Jingshen, Wu Jiajin, and others. Mi believed Huang's testimony, as reported in the newspapers, was defamatory and filed a lawsuit seeking investigation. Judge Qiu Huan Ying held several hearings to summon witnesses. However, due to the possibility of a settlement, the court adjourned the hearing and instructed both parties to settle the matter. If a settlement was reached, the lawsuit would be withdrawn. If no settlement was reached, a new hearing date would be set. These details have been previously reported. Yesterday, Judge Yang Ding of the Second Special Court continued the hearing in the criminal division. The plaintiff, Mi Jingshen, was absent, having previously submitted a statement to the court requesting a temporary suspension of the trial to allow for handwriting analysis of the 100,000 yuan promissory note to determine whether it was indeed forged. The defendant, Huang Xianyao, testified in court: "After my family declared bankruptcy, others still thought we had some money. So I came up with a plan to first apply to the Shanghai Local Court for mediation with my father-in-law, Zhou Songqing, regarding 100,000 taels of inheritance. My brother-in-law, Chen Xingwu, also came out to mediate at that time. The 100,000 yuan promissory note was handed over by Wu Jiajin and taken by Mi Jingshen to Wu Zhiping (Zhou Songqing's legal counsel) to compare the handwriting. Knowing it was fake, I didn't formally sue. However, the promissory note was placed in a safe deposit box by Shan Tang Chunshou, and the creditors of the Gongfa Company were called to report the destruction of evidence. The handwriting had already been analyzed. I was used and sentenced to imprisonment, which should be suspended. However, I feel very sorry for Mi Jingshen, so I asked friends to mediate a settlement, intending to withdraw the lawsuit." Huang's defense lawyer requested the court to summon Chen Xingwu, the most important witness in the case, who had repeatedly failed to appear despite being subpoenaed. He requested that Chen be arrested and brought to court for questioning to clarify the entire situation. The court reviewed the testimony and announced that the hearing would be adjourned for further summoning of witnesses.</p>

<p>Zhan Daosan, the owner of Zhan Dayou Ink Shop on Fangbang Road in this city and a native of Anhui, died in 1929, leaving behind an estate of over 2 million yuan. Zhan Daosan had no sons, only a daughter, Zhan, who married Cha Qilin, also from Anhui, and had three children. However, Zhan also passed away in 1932. Zhan Daosan's younger brothers, Zhan Yunsan and Zhan Songsan, became involved in a dispute over their brother's estate, leading to years of litigation that has yet to be resolved. Recently, Cha Qilin filed a lawsuit in the District Court Prosecutor's Office against his uncles-in-law Zhan Yunsan and Zhan Songsan, as well as Zhan Jixian and Yu Ruizhi, for forging a will and inheritance document. Prosecutor Tang identified Zhan Yunsan and others as having forged the documents and initiated a public prosecution. Presiding Judge Cai held several hearings without resolution and ordered Zhan Yunsan, Zhan Songsan, and Yu Ruizhi to pay 10,000 yuan and provide written guarantees from five reputable businesses as collateral, pending further instructions. It has been learned that Zhan Yunsan was bailed out by a lawyer at the end of the lunar year, before providing the guarantee. Yesterday, this case was again heard by Presiding Judge Cai. At 10 AM, lawyers Peng Yuanxun and Zhu Fengchi accompanied Zhan Yunsan to court to submit the guarantee. Presiding Judge Cai noted that the defendant Zhan Jixian had not yet appeared and adjourned the hearing for further summons and verification. Zhan Yunsan, Zhan Songsan, and Yu Ruizhi were finally bailed out by a pawnshop and others in the afternoon, regaining their freedom.</p>

<p>Sun Yanhuan, a 14-year-old woman from Ningbo, was sold by her father and a certain Mr. Jia for 100 yuan to Zhang A’wu, a woman from Zhenjiang, as a prostitute on Double Ten Festival last year at Room 23 of the Zhaoshang Hotel, No. 13, Lane 566, Zhejiang Road. Sun's father only received 40 yuan at the time, with the remaining 60 yuan being embezzled by Mr. Jia. A few days ago, Sun's father happened to meet Mr. Jia in Nanshi and demanded the 60 yuan, leading to an argument. The police arrived and took them both into custody. The police ordered detectives to cooperate with Detective Zhang Yuanjing of the Old Gate Constabulary and arrested Zhang A'wu at No. 7, Lane 614, Fuzhou Road, rescuing Sun Yanhuan and bringing them back to the constabulary. Yesterday, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Constabulary lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted them for violating public morals under Article 231 of the Criminal Law. After investigation by Judge Yang Qianchang, the hearing was adjourned for further questioning.</p>

The chairman reported that the Chinese and Western-style vegetarian restaurants in this city are enthusiastically patriotic and have voluntarily proposed collecting funds for national aviation, which the association approved. The Municipal Government has approved the collection method, which is to collect one percent of business income, and it has officially started today. The collection of funds for national aviation from the hot water industry has also been approved by the Municipal Government. Due to the scattered nature of this industry, a survey is difficult, and the association has requested the Public Security Bureau and various sub-bureaus to conduct the investigation, which should be completed within two weeks. The date for the start of the collection will be set then. The association has also convened meetings with the heads of various entertainment venues to discuss promoting national aviation and collecting funds for national aviation, and they are planning to implement it. The association's headquarters and exhibition hall will be completed by the end of March and will be moved into in early April. An aviation library will be established, and all kinds of books, magazines, and publications related to aviation and air defense should be collected as much as possible. To facilitate communication and work, all staff members of the China Flying Society related to the work of the association will be convened for a meeting every week to clarify the situation and facilitate progress. In order to expand the promotion of national aviation and solicit members, the association has decided to develop both domestically and internationally. In addition to the branches that have been established in various provinces, counties will be used as units to carry out powerful publicity and solicit members of the association and the China Flying Society. The association also needs to further promote it overseas. The winding up of various solicitation teams has been decided to be carried out in stages. All field secretaries are expected to work hard to assist in increasing progress. The success of the collection of funds for national aviation from various industries is excellent. Following reports from various field secretaries on the progress of contact and inspection, the discussion of multiple fundraising proposals was held, and the meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing in response to the article published in your newspaper on January 28th regarding the case of Dehe Xing et al. suing the Wuhua branch of the First Special District Court for fraud. The article stated that because Shoumin was a consultant for the bank, some depositors filed a criminal lawsuit against him in the Second Special District Court. It also mentioned that after the preliminary trial, Tang and others were fined. This is not in accordance with the facts. After investigation, my client, Mr. Tang Shoumin, was indeed hired by the bank as a consultant, but he resigned shortly after and never attended any of the bank's consultant meetings. As for the preliminary trial in the Second Special District Court, Mr. Tang Shoumin's position as a consultant was based on a contract, which is different from the responsibility of a director of a joint-stock company. Therefore, the court ruled him not guilty. There is a record of this, and this letter is specially issued to clarify the truth and avoid misunderstandings. I hope you will correct the record.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>— (Drunk Woodcutter)</p>
<p>The glass on the window probably cracked due to the pressure of the cold air. Because my bed is right next to this window, I didn't wake up during the night. When I woke up in the morning, I suddenly felt that my sense of smell and breathing were difficult. Ah! I have a cold! I thought: I didn't get cold at night, so how could I have caught a cold? Later, I looked out the window, and the sun was on the corner of the roof. Suddenly, a chill pierced my cheek, and I felt uncomfortable: Oh, now I feel the cold air outside is coming in through the crack in the glass; at the same time, I understand why I caught a cold!</p>
<p>After patching the crack with paper, I returned to normal in two days; but I thought of how terrible this small crack is! If we show cracks in our behavior, wouldn't we become social pests? We must be healthy people! But on the one hand, we must be careful in our behavior and not allow any cracks to appear! Friends: Don't underestimate this tiny crack. A leaky cup will not retain a drop of wine! If we do not mend the cracks in our behavior, then our personality will gradually be lost!</p>
<h3 id="e157">Shooting Sports in the Countryside <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Linchang</p>
<p>Shooting is an essential part of training the people. When farmers are free in the winter, they gather in groups of three or five, hang a gourd on a big tree with a rope, and then take turns shooting at the gourd. After each person shoots five or ten times, they take the gourd down to see how many bullets hit it, to test each person's shooting skills. There is also a type of shooting where a round piece of wood is rolled on the ground by another person, and the people next to them shoot at it. This is practice for shooting running wild animals while hunting.</p>
<p>There are many methods of practicing shooting. Pistol shooting requires particularly good wrist strength to control the vibration of the gun, so that the target to be shot will not be missed. However, this is a very difficult type of shooting; although the gun has a "sight", it is not as easy to aim as a rifle, so it all depends on the individual's shooting talent. Otherwise, even if you give him a lot of time and bullets, he still won't hit anything.</p>

<p>— Yiye</p>
<p>The world-famous divorce city, Reno, USA, has a judge named Maolang, who has been in office for twenty-four years, recently published an opinion on the dangerous period of marriage. He said that the first fifteen years of marriage are the most dangerous period. After these dangerous fifteen years, nine out of ten couples will grow old together, and very few will meet in court again for a divorce. This judge has decided about 30,000 divorce cases in these twenty-four years, so his words are certainly quite reliable.</p>
<p>Based on his experience, he advises young couples to be extremely tolerant and attentive to all trivial matters in the first fifteen years of marriage. He said that in the divorce cases he decided, most were due to some extremely small conflicts. For example, a husband put powder on his wife's clothes as a joke, which led to a conflict and divorce; a husband spilled soup on his wife, which led to a conflict; a husband's wife was dissatisfied with the things he bought, which led to resentment. He said that tolerance is the most important condition for cohabitation, and the first fifteen years of marriage are the most difficult period to tolerate.</p>

<p>— Erdong</p>
<p>One evening, after the Jin Suqin and Jin Suwen sisters of the Golden Grand Theater finished performing "Hongni Pass", the stage was changed to Li Wanchun's famous play "Marquis of Hanshou", which immediately transformed the audience's deeply impressed graceful scenery and gentle posture into a solemn and brilliant impression of righteousness. The depth of drama is so touching that it is not surprising that it has this ability. After the Jin sisters took off their makeup, they were invited by many female friends to visit Li Wanchun's red-faced good drama in the front row. For a time, the colorful flowers under the stage and the antique style on the stage reflected each other, which really made the audience overwhelmed. The most amazing thing was that when the play was performed to the scene of training his brother, Wanchun said in vain, "Although I am in Cao Ying, my heart has never stopped thinking about my brothers in Taoyuan." One word, one tear, full of sound and appearance, tragic and desolate, full of sorrow, all the audience in the courtyard praised, and could not help but burst into tears! At this time, Jin Suwen, a girl under the stage, already had tears in her beautiful eyes, burst out of her eyes, bowed her head and wept uncontrollably, Suqin quickly took out a silk handkerchief to wipe her tears, and her peers Yan Yan Yingying comforted her in unison, and the little sister was already like a pear blossom after the rain. For a time, the stage and the stage reflected each other again. I don't know if Chu Suwen's heart is soft, or Wanchun's skills are high, which is really a rare phenomenon in the play. After watching the play, I still yearn for it, and I write it down to tell those who have a habit of Zhou Lang.</p>

<p>Chapter 23: Eloquent Discussion in the Room Leads to a Lawsuit; Sharing Wine with Old Friends Makes One Forget Grievances for Profit</p>
<p>Jin Ziqiang's face turned red when he heard this, and he said with a forced smile, "Brother Jia, what do you mean by this? Are you joking, or do you really want to take my land?" Jia Duocai raised his hand and scratched his hair, then smiled, "Your words make it difficult for me to answer, because it can be said to be a joke, or it can be said that I really want this land. I'm thinking, if Mr. Jin doesn't buy it, I'll take it over." Wang Shicheng couldn't help but be stunned when he heard this kind of talk, and immediately looked at Jia Duocai, thinking that he must have something to say in business and would continue to talk. But Jia Duocai said this, stood up, cupped his hands to Jin Ziqiang, and said with a smile, "I'm just kidding you. There is a saying that a gentleman does not take what others love. I'm leaving, you two talk about business." After saying this, he nodded repeatedly and walked away. Jin Ziqiang took the extinguished cigar, put it back in his mouth and took a few puffs, then struck a match and slowly smoked, seeing Wang Shicheng sitting there with his head slightly tilted and not saying a word, he walked up to him and said in a low voice, "We have already talked about the business to this extent. If we break up the deal, it will be obvious that we are not good friends. How about this, I will go to your mansion tomorrow afternoon to talk. You should also know that I am a person who says one is one and two is two, and I am not joking with people." Wang Shicheng didn't say anything more, grabbed a woolen hat placed on the bed, cupped his hands and walked away. He understood a little in his heart that the price of this land had probably risen a little, and both of them were rushing to buy it. With such an opportunity, he should not let it go easily and should ask others for advice. He was thinking with his head down, but he kept walking forward. In the dark corner of the room, someone asked softly, "Mr. Wang, are you going back to your mansion?" He was startled and stopped to look. Jia Duocai was full of smiles and walked out from the screen door at the corner. The afterglow of the gasoline lamp hanging on the beam of the hall could be seen that Jia Duocai was holding a piece of paper in his hand. He whispered with a smile, "The land price you want is a little higher, but the price Mr. Jin is offering is also a little lower. If you think I am still worthy of being a friend, you might as well talk to me about this business." (398)</p>

<h3 id="e162">Guosheng Bottles in Shijing Township <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Minsheng</p>
<p>All those who have read history know the surname of Zheng Chenggong, a national hero in the early Qing Dynasty. Although he failed later, his prestigious name of "occupying Jinmen and Xiamen and resisting the world with a full army" will never be obliterated for thousands of years. The "Guosheng Bottle" I am talking about is his story.</p>
<p>I remember that two years ago, when I returned to my hometown with my family, I passed by Xiamen and went to visit a friend in Shijing Township (Shijing is the hometown of Zheng Chenggong). I saw a very elegant vase displayed on his desk. The mouth of the vase was inserted with a few plum blossoms. I asked my friend and he said it was a "Guosheng Bottle" (Guosheng is Zheng Chenggong's given name). There are two ears on the side that can be tied with a rope and hung in the living room for decoration, but it is not easy to buy. It is said that it was left by a national hero and is a very valuable souvenir. Because at that time, Zheng Chenggong occupied Jinmen and Xiamen islands, gathered people to train troops, and prepared to overthrow the Manchus and revive the Han people. At that time, military equipment and wartime supplies were not very developed. There were only black dragon cannons and red snake guns, all of which were personally supervised by Zheng Chenggong, and there was no need for imported copper or iron. During emergency marches, due to the lack of utensils for holding gunpowder, he urged the soldiers to dig soil and make 10,000 of them, which were baked with charcoal fire and turned into pottery. Then, they were distributed to the army for use. Who knew that this decision was secretly attacked by the Qing army, resulting in failure. Dozens of warships were trapped in the overseas area of Shijing, Nan'an, and many drowned. The land army formation was also surrounded, and many heroic warriors were unwilling to die under the enemy's knives and threw themselves into the Shijing River. The utensils for holding gunpowder (ie, Guosheng bottles) were left at the bottom of the river. Later, nearby fishermen found a lot of pottery bottles when the tide receded and picked them up to ask the elders. They said that this was a piece of war history, so it was named "Guosheng Bottle". At first, the villagers did not pay much attention to it. Because poets and officials in the Nanyang Islands and cities bought them at high prices to insert and grow fresh flowers, regarding them as treasures, the fishermen desperately searched for them and regarded them as rare goods. Each bottle was sold for more than forty yuan, so the "Guosheng Bottle" became an antique of the nobles. Although the bottom of the river has been salvaged several times by fishermen, it is still difficult to obtain. According to general antique players: Recently, some people have faked them to make money, but the real and fake are easily distinguishable. The real ones can be used to grow flowers for up to eight months without changing the water, while the counterfeit ones will breed maggots and stink if the water is not changed for a few days. I am not a collector and cannot prove it, perhaps it is somewhat close to mythology.</p>
<p>Rambling Talk</p>
<h3 id="e163">Random Talks About the City God Temple <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Huoxueming</p>
<p>The City God Temple in the South of Shanghai, which gathers commodities to form a market and uses the worship of divine power as an allure, has long been regarded as a scenic spot in Shanghai. Its spirit can truly express the lazy characteristics of the Chinese people to the extreme, so foreign travelers must come here to visit, thinking that it is the only accurate vault reflecting the consciousness of the people. Ryunosuke Akutagawa mocked this temple in his "Travel Notes in China", comparing it to the "Green Day" in Japan. However, the Chinese people regard it as having the same shortcomings as the Xuanmiao Temple in Suzhou and the Confucius Temple in Nanjing, such as being decadent, dirty, noisy, and dim. In fact, Ryunosuke Akutagawa's satire was just an observation from fourteen years ago, and it is no longer suitable today. Just look at the arrangements of the shops and stalls, neatly arranged on both sides of the wide cement street. At dusk, the bright electric lights illuminate the towering and solemn municipal building. Even inside the temple, you can't find plaques with coal smoke, but absorb the full sunlight. Moreover, the architecture of Xuanmiao Temple and Confucius Temple cannot imitate the modern style and use steel and cement? However, there is one undeniable fact, that is, under the nine-turn bridge made of red granite, the pool of green and black water is always reluctant to be changed, but it raises the tortoise shells released by kind-hearted men and women with the heart of Bodhisattva, which emit an unbearable strange taste in the summer. This not only adds a sense of disgust to the minds of the visitors, but also urges the municipal health authorities to pay attention in terms of public health!</p>
<p>Secondly, at the turning point of the nine-turn bridge, there are often men and women beggars sitting with a basket and a stick, and exhibiting their fat legs or bloody arms, which are made up with something; to arouse the pity of the well-off class. Although looking at it can also make people suffer, the trick of selling disabilities cannot be regarded as a new life after all. What's more, when saying a Mandarin sentence, it is said that in the scenic spot where "Chinese and foreign tourists gather", exposing this "distorted health" may not be regarded as international decency, right?</p>
<p>Speaking of the nine-turn bridge, I can't help but think more about the moon on the bridge. Although Du Mu's famous line "Where is the jade person teaching Xiao" cannot be sung, and the water under the bridge is not as clear and empty as the twenty-four ringed dragons; but if you run to the stone altar of the Huxin Pavilion alone and coolly in the dead of night, and listen to the gentle breeze combing the willow branches, reflected in the dark blue turbid waves illuminated by the moonlight, there will be countless floating shadows, smiling with the dark waves. Moreover, the fish in the lake, occasionally hearing human voices, will also move their tails and jump magically, in the moonlight, a quick glimpse, like a silver knife. Opposite is a green lacquer "small world", no longer like just now: bustling with stringed instruments and pipes, with shadows of people; but silently still, just like a dancing girl who feels tired and is sleeping soundly. It has unloaded its gorgeous makeup, the diamond-like electric torches are completely extinguished, the hot emotions are frozen into ice, and the red flames have turned into dead ashes. How clear and cold this night is! How cruel! What's more, there is the moon. In this environment, it is impossible not to have the feeling of sitting alone in an empty mountain and looking up at the universe! I think: Why did Li Taibai ride a whale on the top of Caishiji, and why did Jiang Shunan throw himself into the Yandang Shimen Pool, there is a deeper meaning! Changing the temptation of the moon! … And me? Speaking of it, it is still ordinary and vulgar! How ashamed!</p>
<p>Occasionally read "Mo Yulu" by Mao Xianglin (a Shanghai native), a generation of Qing Dynasty Confucian scholars, in which there is a passage saying: "One day, I went to Yu Garden with a tour group. Seeing a stone beam spanning the water, I decided to take a moonlit night tour, saying that its pool is clear and the mirror is clear, and the scenery must be better than painting. That evening, it was just as bright as possible, and the leak was three times lower, and I was about to go to sleep; suddenly I heard a knock on the door, and when I opened it, it was Ziqi. He said: Seeing this moonlight, I can't sleep, can I go to the daytime event? I said: Yes, so I walked north with the moon, strolled to the garden, and wandered through the flat bridge nine turns, and climbed a mountain west of the stream. Looking around, the moon was as bright as silver, and the bottom was clear. There is a small pavilion on the top of the mountain, where we took a break. Then we went to the stone beam and saw several beggars lying on the side of the fence. I said: Isn't this the one who got my heart first? We laughed together. …"</p>
<p>After reading the above short article, isn't the current Yu Garden still the same? The only difference is that the nine-turn bridge in the past was made of wood, but now it has been changed to granite; in the past, people could walk into the big rockery at will, so there is a sentence "climbing a mountain west of the stream", although Cuixiu Hall will be open now, it has not yet been realized. As for the beggars lying in the garden in the past, it is still the same now, and they even show up in the daytime. The water in the past was: "The pool is clear and the mirror is clear", "The top and bottom are clear", but now it is dark green, corrupt, and stinky, and it is not intended to be changed. The times are moving towards the road of science day by day, but public facilities are always stagnating in a static state. Isn't it worrying? If this is not possible, do you still want to overthrow superstition? Destroy the mystery? So I agree with Ryunosuke Akutagawa's warning: "In the temple, on that side walks a Chinese fashionable person wearing a beautiful western-style clothes with a purple crystal needle-point brooch, and on this side walks an old-fashioned woman with silver anklets and three-inch small feet. Chen Jingji in Jin Ping Mei and Xi Shiyi in Pin Hua Bao Jian - among the many people, these kinds of heroes seem to be there. But what about Du Fu, what about Wang Yangming, what about Zhuge Liang; they don't seem to be found at all. Even if you want to desperately defend that he is lying, the form can still be barely justified; but how to cover up this kind of lazy characteristic in the spirit?</p>

<p>Feixing Defeats Huawei Group B Huawei Forfeits</p>
<p>Liangxi Defeats Guanghua: In the Shanghai Basketball Association's Group B game last night, the Liangxi vs. Guanghua match was the closest. At the beginning of the battle, Guanghua, aware of their opponent's playing style of speed, used a gentle approach to counter it. Indeed, Liangxi had no way to deal with it and was once pressured by Guanghua with a score of 1 to 8. By halftime, they had managed to even the score to 14 each. After the restart, the scores of the two teams rose and fell, closely following each other, and the situation was extremely tense. When time ran out, Liangxi won by one point with a score of 29 to 28. If there are no unexpected changes, Liangxi has high hopes for the Group B championship.

<p>Guanghua First Half 14 Second Half 14</p>
<p>Mai Ling Defeats Zhongshan: The Mai Ling vs. Zhongshan Group B game was actually very different. The outcome was already expected. Moreover, only five Zhongshan players showed up. Dong Shuzhao had to play a fourth game and there was no one to substitute. They had to fight with only four players, making them even more unmatched. As a result, Mai Ling won by a large margin with a score of 99 to 13.</p>

The players of the team have now been selected, in addition to Feng Jingxiang, Tan Jiangbai, Li Tiansheng, Ye Beihua, Liu Qingcai, and Yang Shuiyi of South China and Chen Minggui of South China Hua, the iron gate Huang Jiliang will also join the team. With such strong strength, the future results are expected to be considerable. However, the departure of talented players from South China will inevitably disappoint people. The list of selected players of the team is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Huang Jiliang</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng</p>
<p>Tan Jiangbai</p>

Zhongqing has many famous players and it should not be difficult to overcome Jicuige in one fell swoop. The strength of the other groups is balanced, and the competition is expected to be fierce. The schedule for today is recorded below:</p>

There are one national kindergarten and one elementary school each, jointly run by the National Southeast University and the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, so the school is both national and municipal. Its various figures are listed under both the national and municipal columns. However, in the total, duplicate numbers are excluded to conform to reality. 3. The one other type of public elementary school is the Zunpu General Bureau Workers' Children's Elementary School. Because there is no suitable name in other categories, it is temporarily called "other type of public." 4. The numbers for expenses and assets are all in national currency silver dollars. 5. The symbol "——" in the table indicates that there are no numbers in reality. Survey period: August to October of the 24th year.

<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott</p>
<p>When Mr. Bhaer entered the classroom the next morning, he looked very happy. The children were wondering what happy thing he had encountered. Later, they simply thought he was crazy, because he went straight to Don, grabbed his hands, shook them tightly, as if praising him, and said in one breath:</p>
<p>"I know everything, I beg you to forgive me. That kind of behavior is just like you, and I love you for it, although lying—even for a friend—is never right."</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" Ned shouted, because Don didn't say a word, just raised his head, as if the burden on his back had been lifted.</p>
<p>"Don didn't take Tommy's money"; Mr. Bhaer said this, even shouting loudly, he was really happy.</p>
<p>"Who took it?" the boys asked in unison.</p>
<p>Mr. Bhaer pointed to an empty seat. Every eye followed the direction of that finger, and for a moment no one spoke, because they were all surprised.</p>
<p>"Jack went home early this morning, but he left this, which I found tied to my doorknob when I got up this morning," then Mr. Bhaer read, and the whole room listened in silence:</p>
<p>"I took Tommy's dollar. I saw him put the dollar there through the crack in the door. I was afraid to say it before, although I wanted to say it. I hate Ned for following him, but Don is a good man, and I couldn't bear it any longer. I didn't use the money; it's still under the carpet in my room, behind the洗台. I am very sad. I'm going back, and I don't think I'll ever be back, so give my things to Don. Jack."</p>

<p>More Literary Content than Scientific Content in Publications</p>
<p>Crude Printing, But Prices Not Affordable for Common People</p>
<p>The National Children's Publications Exhibition, organized by the National Children's Year Implementation Committee, opened in Beijing on the 30th of last month. Hu Shuyi, a member of the committee and a judge, returned to Shanghai yesterday. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency visited him to inquire about the situation and impressions of the publication exhibition. According to Hu, he went to Beijing to attend the standing meeting of the National Children's Year Implementation Committee and to participate in the judging of the National Children's Publications Exhibition. The judging criteria are divided into content and form. The judging method divides the products into ten categories and invites experts to serve. Hu served in the series group of various publications. After visiting, he deeply felt that this exhibition was a national initiative and it was not easy to achieve this success. The news media strongly supported it and published special issues, which proved that society attaches great importance to children. The content of these publications is mostly literary in nature, with less scientific and common sense content. There are more texts and fewer pictures, so it is more suitable for senior children and less suitable for junior children. However, in terms of text, the vernacular has become common, which is a very good phenomenon. Due to economic reasons, the printing is mostly crude, but the prices are still too high and cannot be affordable for common people. Moreover, children's publications are of uneven quality and have a profound relationship with children. It is hoped that the Ministry of Education will set up a permanent organ for children's publications, such as organizing a publication research association, hiring experts from various places, holding regular meetings to review national children's publications, and making suggestions to the Ministry of Education. In addition to rotating exhibitions, it is hoped that this exhibition can be permanently displayed and become a children's library. Regarding the content of publications, it is hoped that more attention will be paid to science in the future. The price should not be too high. It is best to have the central government control and run it itself, so that it can be of high quality and low price, so as to achieve universality. The children's publications currently compiled are indeed child-oriented and much more advanced than in the past. The comic strips displayed at the meeting were the most viewed by children, which shows the great effectiveness of this type of publication. Attention should be paid to improvement in the future.</p>

Many new and old students have registered. The school is scheduled to hold semester exams after the start of school.

Those who are recommended by the School Board, Hu She and other organizations can enjoy this right.

<h3 id="e178">On the Value of Medical and Pharmaceutical Publications <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Zhanwu</p>
<p>Education in our country is not universal, and the general public has very little opportunity to learn new knowledge. Take the new medical and pharmaceutical field as an example: the introduction of medicine and pharmaceuticals to our country can be considered to have a history of several decades. In Europe and America, it is advancing rapidly with each passing day. The general public has a considerable understanding of new medicines and pharmaceuticals, and a fairly clear understanding of this new knowledge. But what about our country? The time for the introduction of new medicine and pharmaceuticals is quite long, but the progress of new medicine is so short. The new medical and pharmaceutical community is unable to work hard to promote it, and the general public does not know what to do. If it does not advance, it will retreat. In such a situation, how can the Chinese people understand new medicine and pharmaceuticals and recognize the importance of medicine and pharmaceuticals?</p>
<p>Indeed, China today is like an adult entering school, knowing that they must work hard and use their efforts. Despite the fact that the country is now declining and facing many autumns, old and weak and on the verge of death! But the general medical and pharmaceutical community, the so-called medical and pharmaceutical pioneers who have foresight, are beginning to work hard and have assumed the responsibilities that they should fulfill. Therefore, we have recently often found that every newspaper has medical and pharmaceutical publications, and there are many medical and pharmaceutical publications, some publishing special issues and some publishing weekly issues. And looking at their aims, most of them are: "To popularize common knowledge of medicine and pharmaceuticals, to promote new medical and pharmaceutical scholarship...". Indeed, this cannot be regarded as the efforts of the medical and pharmaceutical community, nor can it be regarded as a great blessing opened by the medical and pharmaceutical pioneers of our country. Taking advantage of the time after seeing patients, they use these public readings to discuss scholarship with each other and promote new medicine and pharmaceuticals. At the same time, they also educate the public, instill some new medical and pharmaceutical knowledge into the public, and popularize medicine and pharmaceuticals, saving China from its current decline! Working hard for the bright future of medicine and pharmaceuticals in our country! This is really worthy of us representing the compatriots of the whole country, giving a ninety-degree bow to the gentlemen who edit medical and pharmaceutical publications. Thanking them for their good intentions. At the same time, this also symbolizes that there is hope for the salvation of medicine and pharmaceuticals in our country, and that it will be possible to be on par with Europe and America?</p>
<p>However, ideals often cannot match reality. Although our salutes are very solemn, and our wishes are very ardent, the reality presented before us is just the opposite. Regarding the medical and pharmaceutical publications that are currently published, I am afraid that if we do not see them, if we see them, we cannot help but make people sigh at the paper! Greatly disappointed! (This refers to most of the bad medical and pharmaceutical publications. The content is rich and has a real value of medical and pharmaceutical publications, not in this example). Therefore, although there are so many publications and the gentlemen who edit the publications are very busy, the medical and pharmaceutical publications that we see in the newspapers that have rich content and have the value of real medical and pharmaceutical publications are actually very few. One of the most heartbreaking points is that there are many snobbish hospitals or doctors who take advantage of the name of issuing medical and pharmaceutical publications, occupying the valuable space of newspapers to publish various medical and pharmaceutical publications. On the surface, they are singing loudly: "Popularizing common knowledge of medicine and pharmaceuticals, promoting new medical and pharmaceutical scholarship." This kind of high-sounding tune, but in reality, they are doing a lot of advertising, blowing their own horns. Making the general public know that the issuer of this publication is a medical specialist in a certain department; or a medical doctor from a certain country's medical school; and often at the end of each manuscript, they also note: "Editor's note: This doctor is a specialist in a certain department, and the clinic is located at a certain address," or "This medicine is produced by a certain pharmaceutical factory, and the pharmaceutical factory is located at a certain address," etc.! Alas! Is this the content of medical and pharmaceutical publications? Is this the value of medical and pharmaceutical publications? How can we deserve to be grateful to them for such publications? Can this also be in line with the so-called "to popularize common knowledge of medicine and pharmaceuticals, to promote the purpose of new medical and pharmaceutical scholarship"; as the purpose? Can we also talk about the value of medical and pharmaceutical publications? Therefore, although the general public lacks new knowledge, one by one they are the old brains and old thoughts of the eighteenth century, and cannot understand everything about new medicine and pharmaceuticals, but such medical and pharmaceutical publications that are responsible for educating the public and deceiving the public also deserve to make the general public angry. No wonder the public wants to say a word: "Alas! These are all deceptive things"! Therefore, although we can sometimes still find some valuable medical and pharmaceutical publications that are rich in content and aim to truly popularize common knowledge of medicine and pharmaceuticals and promote new medical and pharmaceutical scholarship, but in this bad environment and evil trend, they cannot help but be affected a little, and they are easily caught in the whirlpool and viewed by the public with one eye, and there is a possibility of saying a word: "Alas! These are all deceptive things"! Therefore, if we want to think about the future of medicine and pharmaceuticals and for the sake of the entire public, it is really necessary to talk about the value of medical and pharmaceutical publications. We must support valuable medical and pharmaceutical publications so that they do not fall and work harder to move forward. We should think of ways to ban medical and pharmaceutical publications that are worthless and contain deceptive nature. The content of valuable medical and pharmaceutical publications, on the one hand, must focus on scholarship and discuss more issues related to research on the promotion and implementation of medicine and pharmaceuticals. But at the same time, we must also pay attention to the education of the public. For the sentences contained in the publications, we must strive to be popular, so that the general public can happily accept them and work hard to recognize them. Regarding the editing of the publications, of course, we also hope that they are all edited by medical and pharmaceutical experts. We hope that all the experts will contribute their expertise to the country as much as possible, so that this China, which is about to perish, will also increase a little expertise, so as to avoid the foreign people's ridicule to the end! We hope that all the knowledge you know will be completely moved out and instilled or universally applied to the public. For their devastated lives, let's make a guarantee! Be a philanthropist!</p>
<h3 id="e179">Salary Living and Tuberculosis Problems <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Bolin</p>
<p>Among those who live on salaries, especially those with relatively low incomes, if they contract tuberculosis, it mostly leads to very tragic outcomes. The reason for this is different from catching a cold; it cannot be cured with short-term treatment. At least several months, and sometimes even years of treatment are required. Therefore, even if economic issues are not a problem, difficulties regarding leave from the company or foreign firm will always arise.</p>
<p>Moreover, another difficult issue is that tuberculosis rarely causes noticeable pain in its early stages. Thus, people usually continue working as before. However, while勉强 continuing to work, the mild tuberculosis gradually progresses to a moderate stage. At this point, there is a slight fever and cough, but most people cannot afford proper treatment due to their financial situation. As a result, they eventually fall into a severe condition. At this stage, treatment becomes not only difficult, but sometimes even impossible to recover from. Therefore, it is essential to implement thorough treatment quickly, at least when it reaches a moderate stage. In fact, even this may be too late, so the most crucial time is during the mild stage. If complete treatment is not pursued at this point, it will leave a very tragic result throughout their life.</p>
<p>From the perspective of modern medical treatment approaches, starting treatment only after being diagnosed with tuberculosis is already a delayed approach. Therefore, the patient must notice something beforehand, and the doctor must also discover the condition. That is to say, early diagnosis and early treatment are essential. Because in the initial stage, it is possible to receive treatment without having to stop working, and it is also easier to restore a healthy body. This is the general treatment principle, but the difficult issue here is that this latent period, or so-called period of susceptibility, often does not cause significant pain, so it is easily overlooked.</p>
<p>As for the subtle signs during this period, the first is becoming easily tired of work, i.e., constantly feeling fatigued, while body weight gradually decreases, and the person feels thinner day by day. Their complexion is also poor, showing a tendency towards anemia.</p>
<p>However, this type of symptom is not limited to the early stages of tuberculosis; other diseases may also show similar signs in their early stages. Furthermore, they may sometimes appear after a temporary period of overwork. Therefore, the most crucial issue is to pay attention to differentiating them.</p>
<p>If someone usually pays attention to their health, they should be able to sense that their health is deteriorating at this time. A relatively simple diagnostic method is to check one's temperature several times each day. By recording the results continuously on a thermometer, for example, a slight fever of 37.2 or 37.3 degrees Celsius may be observed on days of slight overwork or excessive mental exertion. Therefore, if the thermometer readings show irregular fluctuations, one should quickly consult a doctor for a health examination to determine the cause of the slight fever.</p>
<p>At this time, if it is a specialist, they will immediately take an X-ray or examine various properties of the blood to discover the early stages of tuberculosis development amidst ambiguous symptoms. However, if it is only a regular, simple health examination, the truth may often not be apparent. Therefore, when there is suspicion, one should undergo a health examination, especially seeking a reliable specialist's health examination.</p>
<p>People in this state—that is, those who have a tendency to develop tuberculosis—when combined with occupational overwork, excessive exercise, drinking, staying up late, or other unhealthy habits, often end up developing a genuine onset of the disease. This is a common occurrence in the world.</p>
<p>Besides overwork, the most common situation is developing the disease after catching a cold. Commonly, colds do not refer to a fixed disease; any feverish illness is referred to as a cold. If the fever and sweating do not subside after this cold, and coughing or phlegm continues, many people believe it is the onset of the disease.</p>
<p>Besides colds, when fever occurs due to gastrointestinal disorders, its prolonged results often turn into cases of tuberculosis. Therefore, such situations also require considerable attention and thorough treatment.</p>
<p>If the recovery takes too long, the possibility of tuberculosis must be considered, and a health examination by a specialist is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>However, most people always overemphasize the so-called preventive measures to avoid tuberculosis infection. That is, they focus on how to avoid being infected by tuberculosis in the air. However, they do not know that most adults have already been infected.</p>
<p>However, even with an infection, tuberculosis does not necessarily develop, and there are also many people who have a considerable amount of latent tuberculosis but are always very active and without any hindrance. Therefore, the main focus of tuberculosis prevention is to prevent the latent tuberculosis in a harmless form from becoming apparent. That is, infection prevention is external prevention, but disease prevention is self-prevention.</p>
<p>As for the onset of tuberculosis, it mostly occurs when physical strength is excessively weakened. Therefore, salaried workers who have few opportunities for muscular exercise should never engage in excessive exercise on holidays, and unhealthy entertainment such as binge eating and drinking, and staying up late, should also be avoided as much as possible.</p>
<p>However, appropriate exercise is very beneficial. Even if it is for a short time, it should be practiced daily. In particular, cold water friction when getting up or going to bed, or light walks and light exercises, are necessary and should be encouraged.</p>

<h3 id="e180">类癎Catalepsy <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>— Medical Stories, No. 17 —</p>
<p>Someone has calculated that one person in the world is buried alive every twenty-four hours. How can this be?</p>
<p>It is said that in the United States alone, an average of one person per week suffers from "catalepsy." Catalepsy is a state of static sleep, the cessation of life—all the vital functions of the human body temporarily halt. This situation leads doctors to declare the patient dead and the patient's family to prepare for burial, but in reality, the patient is not dead. After a few days or more than ten days, the patient will awaken.</p>
<p>Catalepsy belongs to the realm of hypnotism because it is purely a sleep of objective consciousness, a cessation of vital functions, a rest for all vital organs. A perfectly healthy person can be placed in a cataleptic state by hypnotic suggestion. Alternatively, catalepsy can be triggered after a long illness or nervous exhaustion. Whatever the cause, the phenomenon is the same—a gentle sleep.</p>
<p>In certain diseases, especially nervous disorders, a temporary cataleptic state often indicates the peak of the illness, as well as the end of a phase. During this period, nature, with great effort, allows the exhausted nerves to receive the rest they need. The patient enjoys absolute rest, free from all pain. All important physiological functions cease, so the patient can enjoy a restful sleep—a sleep so sound that it makes onlookers suspect it is its twin brother, "death." The duration and depth of this coma are proportional to the severity of the patient's illness and the need for rest and recovery.</p>
<p>The biggest mistake in diagnosing and treating this condition is using external force to restore the patient's consciousness. If this attempt succeeds, it not only creates harmful shocks to the nerves but also interferes with nature's effort to provide the patient with a natural cure. On the other hand, if this attempt fails, it is tantamount to harming the patient's unfinished life because, according to the doctor's report, the family will certainly believe the patient is dead and bury them alive.</p>
<p>There is evidence from real cases. Several years ago, near Indianapolis, a young woman suddenly fainted after a serious illness. Six doctors, after performing the usual tests, all declared her dead. However, she had a little brother who stayed by her side every day, saying she was not dead. On the fourteenth day, suddenly, the young woman opened her mouth, and her little brother seemed to see her tongue moving.</p>
<p>"Sister, what do you want?" the little brother asked.</p>
<p>"Water," a faint reply came from the "corpse's" mouth.</p>
<p>Water was poured into her mouth, and she miraculously came back to life. She continued to live for many years.</p>
<p>According to people who have awakened from catalepsy, during the cataleptic period, although they cannot move, their consciousness is perfectly clear, and they understand what is happening. However, some people are completely oblivious; some are even indifferent to the preparations for their burial.</p>
<p>In short, catalepsy is not a disease but rather the end of a disease, a natural healing mechanism. When dealing with a person suffering from catalepsy, one should completely avoid panic and alarm, use positive suggestions, and quietly await the completion of nature's healing process.</p>
<h3 id="e181">An Admonishment to Those Proposing the Abolition of the Physician's Creed <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>The Physician's Creed was originally drafted by me and passed by the Shanghai Medical Association's Spring Conference of the 20th year. It has been four years since its promulgation. Although I dare not say that all members in Shanghai can strictly abide by it, medical groups in various places have risen to imitate it, and there are few who openly oppose it. Recently, there have been proposals to abolish it, which is truly a strange thing. If it is said that its meaning is corrupt and violates the trend of the times, the construction of a new culture is in fact centered on old morals, and the implementation of a new life is based on the great principles of propriety, justice, integrity, and honor. The government's repeated orders have already been clearly visible to everyone. I believe that what I have listed, although emphasizing the improvement of medical ethics, does not hinder the progress of the medical community, and although based on Chinese ethics, it borrows from the situation of the medical community in Europe and America. The medical community in our country today is still following in the footsteps of advanced Western medical countries. If others can do it and we cannot, what is it but abandoning ourselves? What is it but violating the trend of the times? If it is said that it is empty talk on paper and does not help the facts, the creed is essentially different from the law. Even with the solemnity of the law, it cannot prevent great villains from doing evil. What about a creed commonly observed by a group? However, since the promulgation of the creed, the phenomena of chaos and decline in the medical community have gradually decreased. Except for the quack doctors among the members, there are few member doctors who openly publish exaggerated advertisements in newspapers or engage in fraudulent practices against patients. Therefore, the implementation of the creed cannot be said to be of no small help. The formulation of the creed has three purposes: one is to prevent unethical competition among colleagues, one is to reduce unnecessary disputes between doctors and patients, and one is to increase the members' confidence in the medical community. The meaning of those who propose to abolish it seems to be that the creed is too restrictive and hinders the development of business. However, if medicine is a profession, there must be a possibility of seeking development, but the path to development is divided into proper and improper. Improving our morality and increasing our skills will bring obvious results and enhance our reputation. A high personality will lead to a greater belief. Even if we do not seek development, it is impossible to avoid it. How does this hinder the creed? If we do not take proper means and only rely on exaggeration and cunning to succeed, we may deceive people for a time, but how can we escape the contempt of those who know the truth? Although we can avoid the sanctions of colleagues, how can we gain the trust of society? When our reputation is completely destroyed, our business will also plummet. In severe cases, due to one person's fault, the reputation of all doctors will be reduced. Even without a creed, how can we develop? I have drafted this article not only to admonish those who propose the abolition but also to inform my colleagues of what to choose and discard.</p>

<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(78) Blepharitis</p>
<p>Blepharitis commonly occurs in children with a scrofulous constitution. It can sometimes be complicated by trachoma and conjunctivitis. Poor living conditions, uncleanliness of the eyes, and frequent eye diseases can all contribute to the occurrence of this disease. The most commonly encountered clinically are three types of blepharitis: squamous blepharitis, ulcerative blepharitis, and angular blepharitis. A brief description of each is as follows:</p>
<p>In patients with squamous blepharitis, the eyelid margins are mostly congested and swollen. Slightly yellowish crusts form on them. These crusts are often dry and become scaly. Therefore, this condition is specifically called squamous blepharitis. Or they may be slightly moist. The crusts produced by this condition do not form ulcers on the skin after being removed. This is what distinguishes it from ulcerative blepharitis.</p>
<p>Ulcerative Blepharitis This condition is also known as purulent blepharitis. It is mostly caused by chronic untreated squamous blepharitis, which worsens and becomes purulent. At this time, the eyelid margins of the patient are congested and swollen. Crusts form around the eyelashes. If the crusts are removed, ulcers can be seen at the hair roots, and they bleed easily. Or there may be no crusts, and yellow pus spots are found at the hair roots. This condition can often cause trichiasis and madarosis.</p>
<p>Angular Blepharitis The skin of the eyelid margin at the outer canthus (i.e., the outer corner of the eye) is red and eroded. The center is grayish-white. It is often combined with conjunctivitis, eyelid eczema, and erosion at the corners of the mouth, lips, or nostrils.</p>
<p>Although blepharitis can be cured, it is easy to recur. Careful attention should be paid. Treatment involves removing the crusts, treating the ulcers, or applying ointments or eye drops. For children with a scrofulous constitution, internal administration of arsenic-iron preparations and cod liver oil is more appropriate. The effect will be faster.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Domestic Medicinal Plants (Continued) <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>(13) Red Pyrethrum Chrysanthemum roseum Web et Mhar</p>
<p>(Plant) Native to Persia, it can be cultivated everywhere. It is a perennial herb. The whole plant is similar to pyrethrum, but the stems and leaves are hairless, and the leaf lobes are deeper. It blooms with red ligulate florets.</p>
<p>(Components) Same as pyrethrum. However, the pyrethrin content is slightly lower.</p>
<p>(Uses) This species is stronger than pyrethrum and is less susceptible to pests and diseases. However, the flower yield is low, and the insecticidal power and product color are inferior. Few people cultivate it as a raw material for insecticide powder. It is only planted in flower gardens for ornamental purposes. It is sold in flower shops in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(14) Mugwort Artemisia vhlgaris L. var. Indica, Maxim. Beifuss (German) Mugwort (English)</p>
<p>(Plant) It grows wild in mountains and fields and is a perennial herb. The stem is one meter high. The leaves have petioles and are alternate, one to two times pinnately divided, with the lobes oblong, blunt-headed, and densely covered with white hairs on the back. Terminal spicate inflorescences bloom with small light brown head-shaped flowers in summer and autumn. The fruit is small and thin and lacks pappus.</p>
<p>(Crude Drug) Mugwort Leaf Folium Artemisiae Vulgaris The leaves of mugwort are collected and dried. The leaves are one to two times pinnately divided, with the lobes oblong, blunt-headed, and densely covered with white hairs on the back. This product tastes bitter and has a unique aroma.</p>
<p>The mugwort leaves on the market are made by collecting the stems and leaves, which is not a good product.</p>
<p>(Components) The leaves contain 0.02% essential oil, the main component of which is Cineol (50%).</p>
<p>(Pharmacology) Mugwort leaves have an antipyretic effect. If rabbits are given the distillate of mugwort leaves, within an appropriate amount, there is a clear decrease in body temperature. If given an amount exceeding the necessary amount for antipyresis or a lethal dose, it cannot be used as an antipyretic drug in medicine.</p>
<p>(Medicinal Uses) Old Formula: Mugwort is effective for abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. It also has a hemostatic effect on uterine bleeding and knife wounds when used as a decoction. It is also made into moxa for moxibustion.</p>
<p>Moxa is made by drying mugwort leaves in the sun, pounding them into powder, removing the dregs, and making it from the remaining white villi. Moxa cones made of moxa wool are used to cauterize diseases. It is also used to make inkpads and placed in ink boxes to store ink. It is commonly believed that leaves picked on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month are the best.</p>
<p>Folk Remedies: Dried mugwort leaves can be used as a substitute for tobacco and have an anti-asthmatic effect. It is also often used as an antipyretic drug. Fresh mugwort leaves are squeezed for juice, applied to cloth, and used for insect and snake bites.</p>
<p>(15) Ngai Camphor Blumea balsamifera, DC.</p>
<p>(Plant) It is a self-growing perennial herb. The whole plant is densely covered with brownish coarse hairs, the leaves have petioles, are leathery, lanceolate, serrated, and hairy on both sides. Terminal conical inflorescences bloom with yellow head-shaped flowers. The fruit is small and cylindrical.</p>
<p>(Crude Drug) Ngai Camphor (also known as Ngai Na Xiang) Camphora Blumeae Obtained from the essential oil obtained by steam distillation of this plant. This product is a white or light yellow fragile crystalline mass with a glassy luster on the broken surface. Impure ones contain yellowish-white plant fragments with dirt. This product is almost entirely composed of pure levorotatory borneol and has a unique fragrance.</p>
<p>(Origin) Guangdong has the highest output.</p>
<p>(Components) The stems and leaves contain 0.2-1.88% essential oil, the main component of which is levorotatory borneol L. Borneol. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Section 3 Pyorrhea Alveolaris</p>
<p>(Question 98) Besides hindering chewing, what other harms do decayed teeth cause?</p>
<p>(Answer) Decayed teeth are not only useless but also cause great harm. Their cavities are full of dirt, bacteria, and decayed food. Even with frequent brushing, it is difficult to remove them. No matter how clean and hygienic the food you eat is, can it still maintain its original cleanliness after entering the mouth, undergoing chewing, and mixing with these bacteria and dirt? Many cases of gastroenteritis are caused by frequently eating food mixed with these toxic bacteria.</p>
<p>(Question 99) What is called an oral infectious focus?</p>
<p>(Answer) The meaning of an infectious focus can be generally said to be a localized disease (localized sores, etc.) whose toxins can spread to various parts of the body, causing diseases in other parts. For example, if a tuberculous sore occurs in the lungs, its toxins will spread throughout the body, causing various diseases. This can be regarded as an infectious focus in the lungs. If this type of infectious focus occurs in the oral cavity, it is called an oral infectious focus.</p>
<p>(Question 100) Which oral infectious foci are the most concerning?</p>
<p>(Answer) Pyorrhea alveolaris (i.e., infectious periapical periodontitis) among dental diseases, especially chronic pyorrhea alveolaris and periodontitis, are the most concerning. As mentioned earlier, the pus produced daily by these two conditions, or rather, the toxins produced by the bacteria, are absorbed by the blood or swallowed and absorbed in the stomach and intestines, transported by blood vessels to various parts of the body, causing various inflammations. If it attacks upwards, it can affect the eyes and brain, causing ophthalmitis and meningitis. If it enters the heart or lungs, it will cause inflammation of the heart or lungs. If it affects the digestive organs, it will develop into pharyngitis, gastroenteritis, gastric ulcer, and other symptoms. Whenever the body is weak or a certain organ has weak resistance, it is an opportunity for this toxin to wreak havoc. However, arthritis and gastrointestinal diseases are the most common.</p>
<p>(Question 101) What are the difficulties in treating diseases caused by oral infectious foci?</p>
<p>(Answer) The biggest difficulty is not knowing where the source of the disease is. Because although the disease occurs elsewhere, the source is in the oral cavity. Moreover, this type of disease in the oral cavity is often chronic and does not have severe symptoms, so patients often do not pay attention to it, and some people do not even know it exists. And generally careless or inexperienced doctors only treat the headache when the head hurts and the foot when the foot hurts, and never consider the source of the disease in the oral cavity. Therefore, it often happens that after years of ineffective treatment, the patient becomes extremely weak. Once a famous doctor is encountered, the source of the disease is found, and the oral disease is cured. Other inflammations will naturally subside, and health will be restored.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Finance An Uneasy Market - Gold Prices Rise and Fall <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The Land Stock Exchange Experienced a Large Surge, Ultimately Rising Four Dollars and Sixty Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday's market initially rose then fell due to reports about public bonds. Some people were optimistic, while others believed that the panic over legal tender could be eliminated. Taking advantage of ample supply in the morning, overseas silver markets saw no movement in London (England) stopping, or New York (America) being flat. The forward price of silver in Montreux remained unchanged. Exchange rates rose slightly. London gold rose three pence. The Central Bank's official exchange rate announcement showed England and America were both flat. The customs gold unit rose four li. The standard gold price was listed at $1,146.60. Reports of old public bonds being exchanged for unified public bonds, and the increased issuance of reconstruction public bonds, stirred up optimistic sentiment and buying interest. Pre-market trading outside the exchange opened and immediately rose to forty-six or forty-seven dollars. Da De Cheng, Hui Xiang, Chun Yuan, and Yong all advanced to nine dollars. Ri Chang was still selling, retreating to around eight dollars. However, major players such as Hui Xiang, Ju Da, Chun Yuan, Yong Han, Heng Wen, and Kang all bought, pushing the price past fifty dollars, rising to fifty-two dollars. After the opening, buying interest remained strong, and major players continued to enter, approaching the sixty-dollar mark. Major sellers took advantage of the high prices, gradually trending downwards. Banks such as Zhong Jiao (Bank of Communications) seized the opportunity to sell at high prices, and the number of sellers gradually increased. However, there was a lot of fluctuation along the way. The Heng Feng exchange rate remained unchanged, without much impact. Afterwards, major players gradually sold off, causing the price to fall back below fifty dollars. However, buying interest had not disappeared, and the price was easily pulled back up after falling. The silver equalization tax announcement showed no movement, and there was some fluctuation in the rebound. Although the fifty-dollar mark was ultimately supported, it soon fell again. Banks sold off slightly, briefly turning weak. Fortunately, after falling, there was some support. The trend at noon was generally flat. The after-market was flat and weak. Banks took advantage of the low prices to buy, while buyers took advantage of the low prices to be active, gradually pulling the price up. However, the volume of transactions was limited, and the situation was particularly stagnant. Sellers supplied at high prices. Initial reports of the Indian silver small bars were a decrease of three anna, a second rebound of one anna, and finally a slight decline, closing flat and weak. The number of chips increased to over 13,000, with the bullish side exceeding the bearish side by 26. The daily market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>This morning's price was reported as $1,152, an increase of $8.40 compared to last Saturday. Da De Cheng, Fu Xing, Yong Hui Xiang, and Tian Fa all advanced, rising to nine dollars.

<p>The Hua Shang Securities Exchange still has over 60 million yuan in outstanding accounts. How to close them out has become a very serious problem. Because the terms and quantities of the Fifth Class Unified Public Bonds are different in length and amount, various original bonds are classified separately, which is clearly inconsistent. According to this ratio, the original market price must be too high. If we talk about the settlement price, the long and short sides will inevitably have great disputes. Yesterday, the board of directors decided to ask lawyers to study it. There is no definite solution to the way forward. Before there is any clue, it may not be easy to open the market. The Exchange's announcement is as follows:</p>
<p>"The Ministry of Finance has ordered that the recent business conditions of the Exchange and the types and amounts of transactions of the various brokers, as well as whether there is speculation and manipulation, have been thoroughly investigated by officials sent by the Ministry. Before the completion of the investigation, the Exchange should temporarily suspend trading. You should immediately comply with the order and inform the brokers to comply with it. Therefore, from today onwards, this Exchange will temporarily suspend trading in compliance with the order. This announcement is hereby given."</p>

<p>Bombay Cotton Industry Weekly News</p>
<p>The cotton market was weak last week. The United States could not effectively manage the cotton fields, and white-rotten cotton was moving more frequently, while buyers had no intention of buying, so people's hearts were shaken. However, after the market price fell, it attracted the short covering of Japanese companies and the purchase of Indian cotton to arbitrage Liverpool cotton. Although white-rotten cotton lacked attention, other types of cotton still had considerable demand due to the widening price difference. The local manufacturers' demand was not attracted by the low prices. The attached statistics for last week are as follows (in thousands of bales):</p>

<p>The sesame market of foreign firms suddenly became unstable, and the decline was quite strong. Therefore, this kind of transaction is mainly transferred by foreign firms. Yesterday, the foreign firms who handled it uniformly stated that there was no intention to buy overseas. After that, there was no need to ask for the business abroad. It will probably take a month before they have an appetite. Therefore, the firms with goods are selling to the exchange. Therefore, the market merchants are greatly reduced. It is estimated that the February contract fell by 6 jiao and 1 fen compared to the previous contract, and the March contract fell by a huge 9 jiao and 9 fen. There were only small foreign firms inquiring about the spot price. The Saturday market had opened at 100, and the price was 11 yuan and 4 jiao and a half, a drop of 1 jiao from the previous market. The market fell another 1 jiao and a half yesterday, and there were only 100 tons of transactions. Therefore, the future trend may continue to decline. For spot sesame seeds, the Dongyang gang purchased three or four hundred bags. Since the opening of the soybean market at five yuan, the manufacturers' willingness to buy has relatively shrunk, and the soybean cake sales market has become stagnant. The market atmosphere has turned flat, so the overall situation has inevitably softened. Yesterday, 1,890 bags of soybeans were transacted from Shantou, Xiamen, and other places.</p>

<p>- A Surge of More Than Six Fen -</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market showed a sharp jump in all months. The foreign quotations gradually increased slightly by about 48 fen, but the market sentiment, with the implementation of public debt reform, people can't help but have more speculation, and domestic inventories, if there is no foreign wheat supply, it is estimated by the industry that there may be a shortage before the new wheat comes out, so the buying is vigorous, and the near term rises steadily. The new flour of June and July, due to the low output of the factory, also tends to be good. By the time the afternoon market opened, foreign gangs were still absorbing it, and domestic sales were also slightly moving due to the New Year, making this month even harder. June and July are new flour after all, and the increase is weaker. As a result, the near term rose by about six fen, and the far term rose by about two fen, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday's forward wheat market opened in the morning, and near-term trading was very clear. June and July were still stable, and trading was also slightly lively. By the time the afternoon market opened, this month's prices were firm due to the low inventory, rising five or six fen. There were very few transactions in March, and the prices also rose by six fen. Transactions in June and July were quite smooth, and the prices fluctuated. Looking at the wheat market situation, because there is little old stock left, and the new wheat is still far away from entering the market, the subsequent steps must be stable. The spot wheat market, trading is not smooth, but the prices are still rising. The high-quality goods have already shouted up to five yuan and two jiao and a half, and Fufeng Shenda has sold more than a thousand bags, it is said.</p>

It is estimated that the highest grade is 65 yuan, the Tianji is 53 yuan, and the Tianhong is 45 yuan. All of them have increased by three yuan, and the original prices have not been increased for Zheng Er Pao Yuan, etc.</p>

<p>The silk market in this port has been falling frequently since the beginning of the year, and the price difference between the overseas silk price and the price in this port is too far apart. (The overseas white factory B-word 20-22 share only offers 720 yuan, and the price held by the manufacturers in Shanghai is nearly a hundred yuan apart.) There has been no transaction so far. Yesterday, only Xinda Yang purchased five pieces of Qian Shuangniao brand seven-mile feet at a price of 480 yuan, which was just a touch-up.</p>

<p>Double-linked tinplate, whether it is British, American, French, or German goods, has recently been scarce in the market, and the way out is that cigarette factories and can factories are vying for delivery, so the market price is in short supply, and prices are rising one after another. For example, 100 pounds of American goods are estimated at 52 yuan, British and French goods are opened at 38 yuan, Italian goods at 39 yuan, and German goods at 38 yuan and 5 jiao. 90 pounds of American goods are opened at 40 yuan, and British and French goods are opened at 35 yuan. The price of German and Italian goods is between 36 yuan and 5 jiao and 37 yuan. However, the set price is high, and people's hearts are hard, so the industry market is still preventing further price increases. It was found that the total number of boxes opened in yesterday's market was more than 600. It was heard that the most sales were by hardware stores along North Suzhou Road.</p>

<p>Since San Nai came out new last year, most of the goods have been tide-soft, so the ordinary goods will open at 17 yuan. Recently, the arrival of goods is still rare. Although the identity of the ordinary Zhuang is soft, it is still quite popular. Yesterday, the opening price has been opened at 18 yuan and 3 jiao, which is a rise of one yuan and 3 jiao. There are not many recipients of the secondary goods at 17 yuan. According to the Fangxi information, there are more than 3 bags of goods that can be loaded into the bag, and the import cost is about 4 weeks, which is relatively increased.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Starting with Taximeters on Rickshaws <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Xin</p>
<p>Not long ago, we saw in the newspapers a news item about a worker who invented a clock that indicates the year, month, day, and hour. This clock could indicate the year, month, day, and hour by following the rotation of gears.</p>
<p>Now we have seen another news item about a worker who invented a taximeter for rickshaws. It is said that "after the meter is installed on a rickshaw, it can calculate and indicate the mileage and fare accurately by following the rotation of the axle." Even more coincidentally, the inventor of this meter, Mr. Ying Yunqi, is also "a craftsman who is not very well-read." Because of this "invention," it is even more "worthy of admiration."</p>
<p>The invention of clocks that indicate the year, month, day, and hour and rickshaw taximeters are certainly not remarkable in this era of advanced science. However, the fact that these inventions come from China, which is scientifically backward, and that the inventors are all "craftsmen who are not very well-read," makes us feel even more compelled to express our admiration in addition to our amazement.</p>
<p>In contrast to the above two news items, we can cite the case of Xie Qifeng, Lu Xingxuan, and Jiang Mingxia, who are "all wealthy" and "university students," becoming thieves; and the case of Li Daoxun, the 15-year-old great-grandson of the former Qing Dynasty Grand Secretary Li Hongzhang, squandering as much as 20,000 to 30,000 yuan per year. From the extremely obvious contrast above, we can see how the petty bourgeoisie are indulging in the pleasures of present society in this declining period of capitalist society; how the children of bureaucratic families left over from feudal society are pampered and only know how to squander; and how the working class, who bear the great responsibility of the times, are still making contributions to society in difficult circumstances, despite being "not very well-read."</p>
<p>Last year, there was a very enthusiastic Stakhanovite movement in socialist Soviet Union. (Note: The Stakhanovite movement originated because on August 12, 1935, in the Donets Coal Region, a miner named Stakhanov used a pneumatic drill to mine 102 tons of coal in one shift, accounting for one-tenth of the mine's output per shift, breaking the world's coal production record). After this movement, new records were discovered every day in various industrial areas throughout the Soviet Union, and efforts were being made everywhere to improve technical standards and increase labor productivity.</p>
<p>Looking back at China, the function of the rickshaw taximeter and Stakhanov's pneumatic drill are certainly very different, but the treatment they receive can be said to be even more different. One is a grand and bustling movement that is regarded as an "industrial revolution," while the other is: "We hereby acknowledge receipt of the patent certificate for the rickshaw taximeter designed by the applicant. Please receive and report accordingly. As for the previously submitted 80 yuan, after deducting 40 yuan for the patent certificate fee and 2 yuan for the stamp duty, the remaining 38 yuan and the review decision will be sent together with this approval." I cannot believe that the indifference and enthusiasm encountered by the same inventions are so different. Is it possible that China, which is constantly shouting about construction and scientific backwardness, is so indifferent to inventors, especially when the inventor is a "craftsman who is not very well-read"?</p>
<p>Although there are also quite a few "seedlings" like the Soviet Russian Federation in China, the "sunlight" feels too weak. Therefore, "its vigorous spirit" cannot be "described with a proper name" like theirs, and it is becoming increasingly withered.</p>

<p>— Ye Lai</p>
<p>Not a tall figure, with a pair of clever eyes, a plain face, Huang Jiaxing frowned, with a pipe in his mouth, limping from his home to the "fan-tan parlor" under his company's management. The gamblers were staring at the rectangular table, their heads down, as if they were unconscious. The dim yellow light inside wearily enveloped the tired and tense faces of the people. The grayish-white smoke rings spewing out from some people's mouths, one by one, gradually dissipating from thick to so thin, filled the world where the outdoor sun could not be seen, making it even more hazy. The suffocating smell filled with sweat made his troubled heart feel an even worse odor.</p>
<p>Taking a breath, he went up to the balcony that resembled a basin. His eyes, as usual, glanced at the people inside. Huang Ajun, who co-founded the fan-tan company with him, was staring at the table below, his head down, as if he hadn't seen Huang Jiaxing arrive!</p>
<p>"Really..." Before he could say it, he sighed. Huang Jiaxing paced back and forth anxiously, and the slight sound of his sighs made Huang Ajun have to turn his head and glance over:</p>
<p>"Hey! Old Xing, what should we do? This speculative business has failed again. The bonds on the market have fallen so sharply. I heard that there will be some war. Although we are in the South, it's like we are in a warm and peaceful world, and we won't be attacked by any devils or artillery fire. But you and I know that this is a total upheaval, and our financial circles are also being stirred up!"</p>
<p>Ajun paused, desperately took a puff of smoke, and frowned as he looked at him:</p>
<p>"My nephew told me that this is also the most severe year of the economic panic. You think, one bank collapses, then another. The money of our students has almost been eaten up by the Guangdong Bank. Also, we can't even recover 50% of the debts we've lent out. You think, the remittances from overseas Chinese are so short. Our ten fan-tan parlors have become five. And you see, now no one bets three or five hundred yuan at a time. Most people only bet ten or eight yuan. It's really bad luck coming down on our heads. Old Xing, what should we do with these many unclear accounts?"</p>
<p>As he spoke, Ajun fell silent. Huang Jiaxing felt as if a basin of ice-cold water had been splashed on his head. His heart was filled with the clashing and fighting of anger, curses, and private thoughts. He frowned and thought:</p>
<p>"Really unlucky, this time I lost another five thousand." He thought for a moment and then blamed Huang Ajun: "It's all his fault that it's come to this. If it weren't for him, I wouldn't have fallen into this mire. Isn't that right? He took the money and embezzled it privately, dragging on countless debts outside. The company is almost no longer a company. Fine, let's just end it like this. What's the point of continuing?"</p>
<p>He thought, feeling that he still had more than 30,000 yuan in savings. After liquidation, he could always say that Ajun had embezzled two or three million himself. He would never easily release the money to share it again. Therefore, he said very dissatisfiedly:</p>
<p>"Old Jun, we can't go on like this. We have to hurry up and close this company. You think, we are only spending money and not making any money now. You can't blame me. In the past, you spent all the money that came in. Our company is in a terrible state. There's no point in continuing like this. There are fewer gamblers, and the remittances from overseas Chinese are so few that there are almost none. The returned overseas Chinese are always poor and unemployed, unlike ten or eight years ago when the overseas Chinese had so much money that they threw it away in the gambling dens. Now, every copper coin is like their life to them. The gamblers who come here are all empty-pocketed. It's really terrible, so..."</p>
<p>He shook his head, and his dense, long eyelashes closed, leaving only a line through which he vigilantly watched Huang Ajun, probing the furrow on his brow. Ajun also shook his head: (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e207">A Visit to Chiba Soy Sauce Industry in Japan (III) <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— (Ye Xiyuan)</p>
<p>The history of soy sauce brewing in Chiba is also over three hundred years old. During the mid-Tokugawa shogunate, the soy sauce brewing industry here was already very prosperous, and its reputation extended throughout Japan. If we unfold the map of Japan, we can see how Chiba is the most suitable place for soy sauce brewing. Chiba is located northeast of Tokyo Bay, surrounded by the sea on three sides, with the Pacific Ocean truly to the east. The Edo River and Tone River flow together here. The climate is relatively humid in spring and summer, which is most suitable for making soy sauce. The water of the Edo River and Tone River naturally adds to the reputation of Chiba soy sauce, just like Shaoxing yellow wine in our country. During the Tokugawa period, there were dozens of families engaged in soy sauce brewing here. Perhaps because of the water supply, the soy sauce brewing industry in Chiba is concentrated in two locations: Noda, above Chiba, and Choshi, at the exit of the Tone River in the northeast border of Chiba. In Noda, the gurgling streams flowed into the Edo River at the exit of Tokyo Bay. In the shogunate era, these soy sauce brewers in Chiba used their inherited skills and quietly continued their traditional business until the mid-19th century.</p>
<p>The Meiji Restoration not only changed Japan's political life, but the most important thing was the development of Japanese industry after the Restoration. The factory system, mechanized production, and mass production implemented with modern corporate postures gave Japan a strong economic activity, which was the foundation of its political and military affairs after the Restoration. It is this vitality of the new economic life that is the driving force behind Japan's recent political and military activities. Along with the modernization of general industries, the soy sauce brewing industry, which has a long history in Japan, has also emerged in the form of modern enterprises for mass production, changing its original "Asian" form. Most of the soy sauce brewing industries in Chiba must unite to form several modern brewing companies to concentrate their strength. The eight soy sauce brewers in Noda first merged in the sixth year of Taisho to establish Noda Soy Sauce Co., Ltd., and then merged with Nagareyama Manjo Mirin Co. and Joseon Incheon Japanese Soy Sauce Co. in the fourteenth year of Taisho, becoming the largest Noda Soy Sauce Co., Ltd. in Japan. In the Yaozi area,　　　Soy Sauce Co., Ltd. was also produced, which was comparable to Noda. Later, Choshi Soy Sauce Co., Ltd. was established, and together with Noda and became the three heroes of the Japanese soy sauce brewing industry.</p>

<p>Moonlight Girl</p>
<p>The moon is high, the clouds are sparse, the wind is whistling, the willows are slender, by the small stone bridge, the green grass is full, passing through the bamboo forest, walking through the stream, there is a girl; alone in the tung tree shade, lost in thought, recalling something, murmuring to herself, sighing at the bright moon. The insects do not chirp, the dogs do not bark, the flowers do not bloom, the crows do not crow, making her even more melancholy; covering her face and shedding tears, could it be that her father is not happy? Could it be that her mother doesn't love you? Who is fooling around with you? Who is being naughty with you? Don't sigh, don't shed tears, don't be unhappy anymore, don't miss your youth, work hard! Work hard!</p>
<p>The moon is bright, the mountains are low, the grass is green, the insects are chirping, a small boat, crossing the river, rocking past the stone archway, passing through the bridge base, there is a girl; alone in the small boat, lost in thought, recalling something, thinking deeply, telling her heart to the bright moon. The night is long, the dreams are endless, the song is not over, the moon has set in the west, making her anxious; crying loudly, could it be that she is being bullied by someone? Could it be that she has lost her lover? Who is making fun of you? Who is playing with you? Don't sigh, don't cry, don't</p>

<p>The Experimental Drama Troupe has recently been actively rehearsing the play "Mellol Xiang", preparing to perform at the New Light or Central Theater at the end of this month and the beginning of March. The director is the company's Mr. Lu Shi, and the leading role of Mellol Xiang is played by the newcomer Ma Yuan. The performers include Zuo Ming, Mei Xi, Liu Yawei, Liu Liying, Zhao Manna, etc.</p>
<p>After "Peach Blossoms After the Robbery", Jincheng will release "Wild Geese in the Cold River" for Lianhua. (Note: This film is the last film released by Lianhua in Jincheng.)</p>
<p>"Chocolate Girl" is truly a farce that "you will laugh from the opening to the closing," as advertised. (Note: The review of "Chocolate Girl" was sent late by the author and will be published tomorrow.)</p>
<p>Before the recent opening of "Calling Wind and Summoning Rain" by Greater Shanghai, there are two short films, one is "Underwater Aquatic Life" and the other is "City Nocturne". The former is a live-action film of the life of underwater animals, which is very vivid. Not long ago, I saw a short film about insect life; in terms of attaching these short films, on the one hand, it is indeed to make up for the fact that the main film is less than 120 minutes, and on the other hand, it is much more meaningful than the previous specialized attachment of slapstick short films. However, our domestic films not only have to be at least two hours long, but some even unnecessarily try to lengthen them, otherwise it seems that they will be sorry for the price paid by the audience. It is naturally impossible to attach this kind of more meaningful short film.</p>
<p>The same is true for cartoons. I hope the only cartoon makers, the Wan brothers, will work hard!</p>

The book is novel in its subject matter, the compilation is from shallow to deep, and the content is divided into pencil, pen, brush, etc. Various painting topics are very suitable for children's psychology. The printing is exquisite and the price is low. Now it is the start of the school year, and children are specially given special discounts for sale. The distributor is the China Art Company on Penglai Road, West Gate.</p>
