<p>日內瓦　調查對意禁油能吾成功之經濟專家、今日估計意國之現存油量、的五十萬至七十萬噸、僅敷六個月之應用、且卽使意國能在國外購油、共運油船隻亦完全不能應付全部之需要、故專家以為此等事實、已足見油禁之能吾成功、全以美國為轉移、因美國控制全世界煤油產額之半數、且有世界運油船隻四分之一云、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>紐約　煤油煤氣日報今日載稱、二月一日前一星期、美國開採之煤油、較更前一星期稍少、此决每日平均開採額為二。八一五·五五〇桶、更前一星期則為二。八二〇·五〇〇桶、至一月十八日前一星期則每日平均開採二·八三三·六〇〇桶云、（五日國民電）</p>

<h3>英美進行談判　復興國際貿易</h3>
<p>英下院辯重分世界富源　召集國際會議案遭否決</p>

<p>倫敦　前工黨領袖益斯堡提出一議案，謂渠確信戰事之無益，渠主張英政府應立卽努力，以國聯名義、召集國際會議、以處理目前世界各處所以紛紛備戰之經濟難題云、此案昨在下院經劇烈辯論後、被二二八票對一三七票所吾决、但下院以二〇七票對一二五票、通過保守黨伊文士所動議之修正文、贊成藍斯堡提案之首段、而表示政府必切實設法增進國際繁榮與親善之信任、前首相勞合喬治發言、請政府接受藍斯堡提案、陳述世界各處因備戰而起之緊張日甚情勢、並謂、非至國聯代管權之分配重行考慮後、和平决不可得云、</p>
<h3>籃斯堡動議　勞會喬治聲　卒通過保守黨修正案</h3>
<p>藍斯堡於動議時謂、經濟援　問題、如獲取原料與市塲及移民之必要等、皆為目前世界備戰之原因、渠不信專恃武力之任何制度、戰禍一開、而欲保持對敵方之公道乃不可能之事、蓋交戰國已喪失是非心矣、武力造成之解决、遲早必重行考慮而修正之、吾人應考察世界經濟狀况、渠非主張將英帝國分割與人、但欲得世界團結之全新觀念、在此觀念之下、世界原料可以為世界各國服務的國際權威支配之、如各國政府能合作、則此種人道提議、更易實施云、</p>
<p>伊文士旋提出修正文、勞合喬治繼起發言、為藍斯堡聲援、謂各處現積極備戰各國、皆以各國旣皆廣置軍備、吾人亦當踵行為之、此問題之經濟方面、確宜注意、渠曾代表英帝國締結凡爾賽和的、故渠覺責任所在、有不得不言者、在國聯代管權未重行考慮時、渠不信世人能獲和平也、吾人應照會他國、吿以英國重行考慮代管權之準備、根據洛迦諾公的與巴黎和平公的而起之希望、近年已喪失無遺、世界軍備近已大增、而緊張惶恐與危險之局勢、亦愈見增甚、歐洲俄德兩大國互以包圍為慮、德國所懼者為俄法、而俄國所懼者為德日、此種惶恐心理、豈不能及早消除之而不貽後悔乎、經濟考慮誠極關重耍矣、日本在遠東之行為、意國在束菲之戰事、皆其蹬也、渠不主張割讓與帝國一片土、但在全盤考慮殖民問題時、國聯代管權宜重加考量耳、德國之要求、不應因德國若干領袖之愚昧言論而漠視之、渠請政府考慮、此時已吾為可召集各國、詢以何者為其所欲有之時機云、</p>
<p>自由黨貝納士稱、藍斯堡覓取和平之方法、在放棄一切云、藍氏聞之、大為反對、於是貝納士請藍說明渠所不願放棄之物、藍氏答稱、未有可以人命為犧牲之物、除殺人外、儘有他種奮鬥方法云、保守黨愛梅立發言謂、此種會議、必歸失敗、試問召集一種會議、而請各國準備放棄其領土、或變更其經濟政策、庸有濟乎云、外部次官克藍本代政府發言、以答覆藍斯堡之提案、謂政府非不贊成藍氏之言、但意見苟有不同之處、則其所不同者、不在實質、而在信仰之程度而已、無論何人、對於世界備戰之情形、莫不焦慮、如英國果重行考慮其自己軍備之現狀、則其所以為之者、非欲向人開戰也、但欲固其維持秩序之實力、以抵抗擾亂秩序之力量耳、假使局勢改變、而有一般縮减軍備之機會、則政府定願雙手握之、前外相霍爾曾在日內瓦、對於原料問題有所聲明、今政府仍信此種問題之國際討論、定有極大價值、但孰能謂討論此種極複雜問題之時機、今已成熟乎、吾人必須避免重蹈一九三三年國際貨幣與經濟大會慘敗之覆轍、政府不欲有所內避、關於此問題之初步研究、業已開始、但在現有環境下、未能决定續開談判之日期也云、</p>
<p>辯論後、藍斯堡提案被吾决、而保守黨修正案、則被通過、（六日路透電）</p>

<p>倫敦　日本海軍中佐石松近著一書、署為「日本當與英國戰、」頃在此間出版、其中有云、「日本苟非中止向外發展政策、英國卽當放棄其所有權一部份、或放棄其所希冀之所有權、至於修正英日兩國現行商的、雖足以解决經濟困難於一時、但亦不過展延危機來臨之日期、而兩國之衝突終亦無法加以避免、緣日本人口激增富源貧乏、乃致經濟生活陷於艱窘、最終之解决方法、厥惟出於武力一途、日本之所以終有對英作戰之一日者、職是故也、此在英國屬地廣大、富源充牣、縱使放棄若干部份、亦足以自給、反之、日本領土富源兩感不足、故其所爭、實為國家存亡關鍵、為英國策萬全之計、唯有抑制其驕矜之氣、甘自退讓、庶足以自保」云云、作者又推測日本有應付英美兩國聯合陣綫之可能、謂「自歐戰以還、英國竟絕不猶豫而與美國親近、甚至不惜卑躬屈節、以取悅於美國、夫英美兩國逐鹿於世界、各不相下、固屬事實、但如有第三者崛起於國際舞臺、則彼等卽將拋棄嫌怨重修舊好、以為應付之計」云云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>巴黎　法國社會黨執行委員會今日在此間開會、議决提議國會、批淮法俄互援恊定、幷對於此决議亦有不少持異議者、彼等指出此協定對法之危險、故耍求社會黨應得政府保證、確無秘密或公開軍事條文、在戰時使法國協助俄國、方可同意、（六日國民電）</p>

<h3>經濟業談　中國之會計師事業（下）　唐慶增主編</h3>
<p>— 徐永祚</p>
<p>我國會計師事業成立小史會計師不特在我國為一種新興事業，即在歐美各國，歷史亦尙未久；查英國之有職業查帳員，雖已數百年，但會計師事業之發達，則至今不過六七十年。美國之有會計師，至今亦不過四十餘年。若夫我國，則起源旣未達二十年，發達更不出十年耳。查在民國初年，會審公堂由國際公共管理時代，民刑訴訟中關係於余錢債權及公估價格者，嘗引用外國之會計師制度，以為鑑定，雖當時受理委托案件者，都為外人，（著名者如英籍之雪邁羅會計師，及美籍之大美查帳局），然會計師制度，則已於斯時印入國人之腦筋矣。其後民國七年九月，由前北京政府頒布會計師暫行章程，國人中始有呈請為會計師者，其第一人，即為當時正任中國銀行總司賬之謝霖氏，繼謝氏而起者，為服務鐵道部之三四人，其後余亦於民國十年取得讀書，則的計不過十餘人而已，且當時曾經取得證書之十餘人中，正式執行業務者，實猶絕無僅有。</p>
<p>憶余在民國十年初為會計師時，各方前來委托者，終年不過一二件，惟因余當時尙係兼業性質，故實亦未嘗致力於斯。迨民國十二年，信交風潮發生，經商感覺棘手，乃專門致力於會計師事業？翌年（即民國十三年），並發起組織上海會計師公會，期以團體力量，謀會計師事　之發揚光大，不久，平津等處亦相繼成立公會，所屬會員逐漸增多，至是我國會計師事業，始建立基礎，會民國十六年，國民政府成立，國內文物制度，工商實業，氣象一新，會計師事業，遂得乘機發展，然因工商業之進展　　，致猶未足四英美諸國相比凝。</p>
<p>中國會計師事業之現狀我國會計師人數，截至二十四年四月止，共計一一六二人，大的至今尙不超過一千五百人。此數之微，非特與英美相較，瞠乎共後，即與日本之七〇〇〇人較，亦覺望塵莫及，况復其中之大多數均為學校敎師，公司職員，或　府官吏，其能加入公會而正式執行　務者，猶不及全體叫分之一，亦可見我國會計師事業未能長足進步之一班矣。</p>
<p>至就吾國會計師之業務狀况而論，則不外會計師條例第一條中所規定者。按會計師之業務，如前所述，固應以查賬為第一義，而以其他淸算，證明，鑑定等為其决，原可不必以國家法律為之規定，惟在吾國，於最初起草會計師法規時，因鑑於會計師制度係　創舉，為執行業務者便於遵循起見，曾以法律為列舉之規定，故其後會計師法規，雖曾經數次修改，而仍有專列之條文，以規　其事務之範圍，現行會計師條例第一條中，即有如下之規定：</p>
<p>會計師受公務機關之命令，或常事人之委托，辦理關於會計之組織，管理，稽核，調查，整理，淸算，證明，”鑑定各項事務。</p>
<p>會計師得充任檢查員淸算人，破產管財人，遺囑執行人，及其他信托人。</p>
<p>會計師得代辦納稅及登記事務，並得代撰關於會計及商事各種文件。</p>
<p>此三項關係會計師業務之規定，在歷次修訂時，均未有多大之更改。惟其中有為吾人所應注意者，即其第三項之文書事務，蓋此項業務，原應屬於律師執行，今由會計師為之，未免略有越俎代庖之嫌，且考諸外國，會計師業務中，亦鮮有援用者。然吾國會計師條例中之所以列有此項業務，亦有其原因。查此項業務，係於民國十六年國民政府財政部頒布會計師註册章程時所加入，因在當時，余於執行會計師業務之餘，常為各委托公司行號解答關於公司註冊及設立登記等項問題，間或為之代辦文書，深覺在吾國現狀之下，以會計師而兼理此項業務，實有相當便利之處，乃於參加起草會計師註册章程時舉以列入條文，迨以法律明文規定，即成為吾國會計師應有之業務矣。</p>
<p>會計師事務所之內部組織事務所之內部組織，依其業務要項，可大致分為下列數部會計部辦理查賬及設計事務。</p>
<p>文書部　辦理代辦文書及對外往來文件事務。</p>
<p>信託部　辦理破產及淸理事務。</p>
<p>總務部　總理一切庶務事務。</p>
<p>除此之外，如在余之事務所，復有出版部辦理編輯及發行會計雜誌及會計業書事務，訓練部辦理會計補習及會計函授學校事務，服務部辦理推行改良中式簿記及其他答覆會計上之諮詢事務。</p>
<p>在外國會計師事務所，都係合夥組織，其由個人組織者甚少，因都係合夥組織，故範圍非常宏大，如美國之大美查賬局，在世界各國各大商埠，均設有分所，其內部職員共達一三〇〇餘人。惟在吾國因都係個人組織，故未能如英美之宏大，然如立信會計師事務所及余之事務所，均有職員三十餘人，其决如正則會計事務所，亦有職員十餘人。其餘則三四人七八人不等。</p>
<p>會計師之報酬會計師為一種職業，故其得受報酬，自屬應當。决定報酬之標準，可分論時與論案二種。論時者以經辦時間之長短，定其報酬，論案者以經辦案件之難易，定其報酬。外國論時者多，吾國則都係論案。外國之論時者，以美國所定標準為最高，主任會計師每日五十金元，助理會計師每日二十五金元。英國决之，主任會計師每日五鎊五先令，助　會計師每日二鎊二先令；如須論案，則照預定時間計算。吾國報酬之數，都係臨時議定，實際上視會計師之學識經騐及社會上之地位如何，而頗有參差，惟照上海會計師公會所定之標準規定，則計時者會計師以每日五十元計，事務員以每日十元計。論案者則除破產淸理外，可視案情而臨時酌定，惟實際上普通查帳案件，鮮有不滿一百元者。</p>
<p>結語吾國會計師事業，較之外國，自尙頗幼稚，夫以旣有十餘年之歷史，而猶幼稚如此，誠不禁令人興嘆。推其原因，一般社會對會計師業務，尙未有深切之認識了解，實有以致之。英國有格言曰：「好經理全賴好會計師」。於此可見彼邦人士對會計師業務認識之透澈，但反視我國，即為社會上之優秀份子，亦往往蔑視會計師，以為充其量亦不過一賬房先生而已。加以吾國商家習慣，賬目向不公開，甚者，以為聘請會計師，徒然洩其經營上之秘密，因此利用會計師之機會，自然减少；吾國領有會計師證書者之所以大都不即開始執行業務者，或亦有感於業務開展之困難而後然乎！同時從吾國會計師本身着想，在質的方面，旣無英美之精，在量的方面，亦不若歐美之多，國家法律，復不能如英美之從而扶助，宜乎會計師事業之推行，不能如英美之盛矣。所望國人在外能盡力宣揚，使社會人士，咸能了解會計師之業務性質及效用，同時在內則由會計師自己振作，無論在學識經騐上及職業道德上作積極之改進，庶幾會計師事業前途，得有發楊光大之希望。</p>

<h3>白茆建閘與　蘇常各縣水利　周振華</h3>
<p>常熟通信、全國經濟委員會、為疏通蘇省各縣水利、預防水旱災患、特撥欵三十萬元、囑由揚水利委員會、計劃在常熟白茆口築一巨大閘座、業于上月三十日舉行奠基典禮、此項工程、為蘇省所少有者、且關係于蘇·常·崑·太·澄·錫等縣水利、當局異常重視、因于前日行奠基禮時、由財政部長孔祥熙、水利委員會長傳汝霖、親蒞東張市二次主持一切、足證該閘座關係之重大、現定八個月完成、此後蘇常等縣、遇旱可起閘引入江水、遭水則可向外宣洩、永無水旱災患也、茲針白茆閘座與各方之水利、及以往之考證關係、紀錄如次、</p>
<p>白茆河道之位置　白茆河在江蘇常熟縣之東南、經白茆鎭、過支塘東北流至白茆口入大江、其遠源實起于太湖之沙墩口、中貫漕湖·嘉菱湖而達常熟縣境、計自河墩口迄白茆口、長凡一百六十一里、近納尚湖（常熟西湖）昆城湖、而遠接于陽城、巴城諸湖、支港聯貫、實為太湖宜洩之巨流、</p>
<p>白茆太湖關係　昔王摮吳郡治水記曰、「東南諸水、咸匯太湖、由三江入海、而三江允失故道、東江不可復尋、獨婁江尚在、吳淞江雖在而多涸、其別出一支、從常熟白茆港入海、最大且駛」、又曰「太湖吞納眾流、猶人之有腹白茆吳淞、則尾闆也、陽城昆城葦亭諸湖、猶脈絡也、尾闆不洩、腹且脹為病、四支百脈、無不病者」、觀此則白茆與太湖之關係、可謂重要矣、</p>
<p>白茆與各縣水利　白茆河雖不甚長、而支流連絡、周圍數百里、與江陰·無錫·吳縣·崑山·太倉之水利、均有莫大關係、故慕天顏請浚白茆港疏曰、「常熟之白茆港、係蘇常諸水東北出江第一要河、自明季失修、湮滅成陸、旱則潮汛不能、澇則宣洩無路、若此港通、不惟常熟水旱無慮、卽崑山·長洲·太倉·無錫·江陰·無不沾其利」、又劉鼎議浚白茆河文有云、「太湖之流由長洲無錫東注者、藉白茆以歸于海、白茆一塞、不惟常熟為壑、卽常州無錫等地、水無所洩、亦泛濫而瀕于危矣、</p>
<p>白茆河道之現狀　民國二年以前、白茆河之現狀、自支塘鎭以上、河面甚寬、水量恒及六七尺不等、自支塘下駛、經東勝橋後、水量較淺、自此以下、至茆菜灣均深及五尺六寸、淺至四尺餘、再下至朱家巷·蔣家灣·深約三尺八寸、水面四五丈不等、蓋河面較窄、而水亦較淺矣、自典當橋以下、四折至秦家灣、河面寬窄、一丈內外不等、均水平流緩、河心深只二尺、自是下至白茆閘、（前設之新閘）寬約丈五六、深處僅及三尺五寸、新閘去海口不足十里、</p>
<p>白茆河初次大浚　元至正年間、白茆為蘆草所塞、涓流不通、張士誠起兵十萬、以支塘為行府、駐節于山涇口、命呂珍督浚、塹其地為港、長亘九十里、廣三十六丈、此白茆之第一大灘、明世疏浚者、在永樂二年、則有尚書　原吉、宏治七年、則有侍郎徐貫、嘉靖元年、則有巡撫李充嗣、隆慶三年、則有巡撫海瑞等、雖成績彰足紀、然不能逾于三十六丈之寬也、</p>
<p>白茆建閘之重要　潮水之害、非言可喻、故必需蓄清拒渾、查漢　舊規、浦口皆置閘以捍潮、昔范文正論水利、亦舊以置閘與修圍浚河並重繼續起者、多宗是說、或主並修閘壩、以廣其利、舊志有雲、「白茆河道、向本紆回曲折、則泥沙不能一直奔赴、海口築閘、隨時宣洩、則水勢不能冲高湧進、所以資蓄洩防旱澇、關係甚重」、此言建閘之重要也、</p>
<p>白茆建閘之興替　明隆慶二年、知縣張博建白茆港石閘、此為建閘之始、清康熙四十八年、總督部穆布等奏准修白茆康熙四十八年、總督邵穆布等奏准修白茆舊庫、迨道光二年、復建老閘新閘、以時啟閉、此為閘之增建、同治七年、巡撫丁日昌、剏議得浚白茆、移建石閘于蘇常新閘之東、此為閘之移建、惟所建各閘、多不久圮毀、當時閘口闊八丈八尺、閘洞一丈六尺、可知昔時建閘之規模、　不若近時之偉大、然亦巨工也、</p>
<p>白茆建閘之動機　民國二十年及二十三年、太湖流域先後潦旱成災、末由挽救、雖係天時不順、實皆人謀不臧之所致、故欲清弭旱潦、自非浚河設閘修堤及建築水庫不可、惟各項工程、勢難同時并舉、因先建通江各閘、以備旱潦、通江各閘、以蘊藻浜、瀏河口·七浦口·白茆口·黃田港·孟河口·鎭江運河口等七處、最為重要、除黃田港以上（卽江陰以上）各閘均由蘇省府建築、其餘均由揚子水利委員會計劃進行、茲經規定、以白茆閘關係數縣水利、故最早建設也、</p>
<p>白茆閘址之勘定　白茆河原有老閘新閘（南新北新）惟閘外積甚速、不久於塞、致閘之效用全失、旋卽廢棄矣、民國三年、南新閘尚留有木椿及沙灰凝固之閘基外、餘并閘基亦去之矣、故此次建閘、須先測其地勢、審其情形、蓋潮汎之侵襲、與內水之宣洩、均宜詳加勘察、始得决定閘址、現經勘測在南新閘附近之灣曲部分、距白茆口約七里許、該處寬約十五丈、適令河身之平均寬席、較為相宜、另闢新引河長約一百四十餘丈、閘卽建其上、則潮汎之冲刷可免、至閘外防淤之、卽所築閘門、較河牀斷面略小、俾東水勢而利洗刷、至基地有佔用民田約八十餘畝、統由該地給價收買矣、</p>
<p>白茆建閘之利益　閘門之高度、以禦揚于江之最高潮位為準、閘檻之高度為吳淞海平零點以下一·五八公尺、閘門為五孔、每孔寬七·四公尺、閘身長四四公尺、閘上架以橋面、以備將來接通汽車公路、閘之全部以鋼骨混凝土造成、閘門為懸吊式、用均重平衡其重量、並裝起重手搖機、以司閘之啟閉、如是則簡便省力、潮來則閉、潮退卽啟、以利宣洩、而通航行、如冬春內水低落之宣洩有節、旱澇有備、納泥于故道、拒潮汎于閘外、有冲刷之力、無崩圯之患、而蘇省江南各縣均蒙其利也、」</p>

<h3>公共租界　去年商團概況</h3>
<p>英美靑年日漸蕭索　後備計劃難以實行　俄隊實力可稱勁旅</p>
<p>茲據公共租界工部局商團一九三五年度報吿、該團目前最堪注意之問題、即為新兵補充問題、蓋租界商團人數、大概在一千九百五十名至二千一百名之間、前此每年陸續退伍老兵、與陸續招入之新兵、大致尙可相抵、故額數尙能維持、至是年春季、該團有於每個單位中、設立後備隊之計劃、凡各大商行所不可缺少之人員、在動員之時、即歸入後備隊、此等後備隊之兵士、因其為商行重要職員、故於事變發生之時、非至最後緊急關頭、或須暫時代替其他非重要職員之時、不輕加以調動、惟此等重要職員、歸入後備隊之後、其原有空缺、勢須招考新兵補充、去年工部局總董曾以此事致函於本埠各英美商行、請加以贊助、嗣後其地各國商行、亦大半接得此項函件、各商行之答復、均極圓滿、惟招考新兵、人數寥寥、未能將設立後備隊之計劃、施諸實行、所幸者、自此次請求發出之後、團部已能擬就重要職員之名單、此項名單、隨時加以整理、他日動員時、即可用為調動人員之根據也、</p>
<p>再則年齡問題、亦至感困難、即以特別巡捕及團中英美團員而論、亦可覘得本埠適當年齡之靑年、可以加人商團服務者、為數極有限也、且各商行外籍職員、均已裁减、而裁去者、又多屬年幼之份子、靑年西人來滬者、復日見銷索、如目前商團　人數能長此維持、則職務亦不致廢馳惟現在英美二隊兵士、已不能謂為悉屬靑年、故預計倘年幼新兵、不能源源而來、則終有一日、團中老兵、行將老大、喪失其前此對於商團之興趣、致相奉吿退、行伍　見空虛、此等現象、約在一九三九年即可發生、而補救之方、端在市面之恢復舊觀、及國外靑年之接踵而來、現商團主持當局、故不願於動員之時、悉調團員以赴前綫、而於招老新兵之時、復不能放棄其嚴愼之態度云、</p>
<p>商團之中、惟俄國除伍、非但未曾招募之困難、並常有待補之浮人、官長得從而遴選、且前來報考者、大抵體格堅强、知識程度、較前亦已進步、倘遇必要之時、再招一營、亦非難事也、據俄隊長官之報告、現商團中之俄隊、即為公共租界警隊之第一重後備隊、其組織有營本部一管轄兵士三連、此外復有義勇隊兵士一連、共組合「丙種營」一營、此種俄國商團、實為本埠有實力之防禦武器、隨時可以急劇調遣、除去形勢擴大之內亂或外界侵略之外、倘調動俄國步隊、即可無需於商團之全體動員、而本埠之商業、亦即不致間斷、即在目前平安之時、該隊之職務亦甚繁、如各國要人蒞滬離滬之時、概由商團俄隊充榮譽衛隊、其他如華德路西牢、靶子塲及愛而考克路兵營等、亦悉由商團俄隊守衛云、</p>
<p>關於訓練方面、是年曾在虹口公園及僻靜街道、舉行野戰數决、平時演習注重暴動之控制、是年打靶年賽、紀律極佳、成續亦在中等以上、茲因警務處處長之合作指導、在嚴重內亂發生之時、商團即可為警力之臂助、是年並已擬就動員時、糧食運輸之計劃、並有「上海商團戰略」一書製成、書中所載、悉屬正式軍隊之訓練知識、而參以本埠當地之情形、實為極有價値之著作云、</p>

<h3>上海之捲菸業（三）</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概況之十二）</p>
<p>三　上海捲烟業業之衰落</p>
<p>在本文第一節中，曾言及自民國十七年以後，民族捲烟業因增稅外貨傾銷各種關係，已日趨衰落。去年上半年復因財部禁止捲烟贈獎辦法，華商烟廠遂更難與外商競爭，以致各廠（指全國言）產量因銷路萎縮而下降，據財政部稅務署報告，去年一月東區蘇浙皖三省各捲烟廠（大部份在上海）出倉箱數，為六八、六一九·四箱，六月滅為五一、九八四·四箱，其中華商捲烟廠之减少率更較外商為甚，詳細可閱下表：</p>

<p>由前表觀之，吾人可知外商勢力之頑强，同時且知外商除在華自行製造外，更將大批捲烟自海外輸入，擴大傾銷之勢力與範圍。據海關統計，最近三年捲烟之輸入有如下表（單位元）：</p>
<p>民族捲烟業日趨衰落，統稅之增重，每為一大原因。按理言之，就稅增重，中外烟廠所受之影嚮，原屬一致，然在事實上則頗有歧異。蓋外商之出品，大多較為高級，價値亦較大，華商捲烟十九相反，但以往之稅率，對於値價較昂者，其所課之統稅，以相對關係言之，則反較定價低者為小，故華商所受統稅繁重之影響，往往較外商為重。今為求明瞭起見，選外商之仙女，前門，茄立克三種捲烟，與華商之金斧，美麗，七星三種捲烟，作一比較，以明其所負統稅之輕重與盈餘之多寡：</p>
<p>註：本表見二四年九月五日大公報</p>
<p>此表顯示兩種事實，一為外商捲烟課稅較輕（以上級之茄立克為最），二為外商捲烟盈餘較多？此中關係，國人須三思之。（完）</p>

<p>孩子們聽了這不朽的故事，印象極深，因為他們剛才被一對小朋友的義氣所深深激動了。說謊是不合的，然而因為酬答一個知己，不恤冒著不韙，沉著地為別人蒙恥忍辱，——這種大勇，這種高義，竟使唐恩做了他們所崇拜的英雄了。誠實和信義，現在得了一種新的意義，美名之足寳過於財產；一經失去，雖萬貫金錢，也是贖不回來的；而相互間之信托，能使人生安平愉樂，實非其他所能比擬。</p>
<p>韜摩於是愉快地恢復他原有「公司」的名號，乃德益矢忠於唐恩，童子門對於他門兩人，均思有以自　其過去的猜疑與鄙視。蜀夫人看到她的一羣孩子，歡喜不勝，裴先生稱述他一｜對小義友不朽的嘉行，永無倦色。</p>
<p>（註）Damon　and　Pyrhias王則為Dionysus（原文只列二人之名，譯文將故事補充）我國荆軻和樊於期的故事，亦略與相似。（本章完）</p>

<h3>證券　紐約股票恐有反動</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告、昨（五日）紐約股市、漲落互見、克雷斯勒汽車公司定於週四開董事會、據眾推測、屆時發表之股息、恐將較預料者為低、收盤時浮多脫手、該股致起猛跌、農具與郵售股堅挺竟日、一度曾創一九三一年以來之新高峯、後亦隨同回跌、投機家預料市面將有反動、故當克雷斯勒汽車疲落時、即起脫售、再美元匯價回升、市面乃失去一部份通膨脹之刺激、小交易所股票亦漲落互見、油股進出甚繁、在債市方股、茲將道瓊斯紐約指數列左、</p>
<p>紗花　紗價狂跌</p>
<p>五月期紗進兩百元關　現紗行情跌一元以外</p>
<p>紗市續挫、且跌風益熾、實緣海外紗花趨勢不佳、人心恐怖、一般浮多鑒於環境不良、威脅了結者甚眾、市盤乃愈難支持、前途若何、須視外棉為轉移耳、</p>
<p>跌落一元八至兩元六　標紗前市開盤續向疲境推進、且跌風銳利、因海外紗布不振、大阪三品紗市步步下墮、人心愈見驚惶、塲中賣氣濃烈、市價愈難穩定、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌一元八·九角至二元一角、午後開盤、空方獲利稍有抵補、略見反動、但二盤以後、聞消息不好、賣氣仍熾、轉趨下落、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌一·三·四·五角、查實出同孚一千六百五十包、振大一千包、合興八百五十包、長豐三千六百五十包、潤康一千八百五十包、大昶八百五十包、長餘五百包、仁豐七百包、進進達記二各六百五十包、錦昌五百五十包、愼記四百包、義成六百五十包、泰昌一千九百包、信誠二千九百包、大豐五百包、賡豐八大五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>
<p>現紗成交六百八十三包　現紗銷路平平、查全日各帮成交統計六百八十三包、行情跌一元以外、各帮買額如下、</p>
<p>中印棉價接近</p>
<p>棉市續瀉、局勢異常衰弱、因美棉步跌、消息利於賣方、而印棉跌風益濃、比價愈見接近、所以人氣大虛、市價一落千丈矣、</p>
<p>甬帮加碼通成了結　標花前市開盤、各月呈暴落之象、因美棉續跌十二至十七磅首、印棉亦跌零二五至二羅比半、大阪三品紗跌六·七角、於是市塲人心震盪、賣風熾盛、市價愈形不支、盤盤下瀉、寗波帮繼續加碼、通成公司多頭了結、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌五角半至六·七·八角、午後開盤獲利空頭稍有抵補而回昇、但拍至二盤以後、聞印棉暗盤仍向下漲、市况復入疲境、結果本月比上午收盤價漲一角半、遠月勿動、查賣出大孚三千四百擔、大豐四千擔、明德一千四百擔、合興四千四百擔、森康二千六百擔、同豐三千二百擔、大昶一千三百擔、源興昌三千三百擔、益昶一千七百擔、泰昌一千三百擔、買進通記一千九百擔、賡豐一千九百擔、昶記一千七百擔、恒德一千六百擔、愼記三千六百擔、元一二千四百擔、泰昌一千六百擔、潤康七千一百擔、生源一千五百擔、長和一千二百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>
<p>現棉格頗難接近　現棉消費轉趨沉寂、廠需停頓、因期棉連朝狂落、以致兩方討價還價、殊難接近、未能成交、來源亦無、</p>
<h3>美棉大眾傾向賣出</h3>
<p>——跌十二至十五磅音——</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、利物浦消息不佳、外商賣出、多頭了結、各月跌九至十一磅音、多頭由近期移至遠期、同業買進近月、賣出十月、政府脫售陳棉計劃、及農田法案、為場中市况不定之要素、最後大眾賣出、形勢又疲、計現貨跌十五磅音、期貨跌十二至十八磅音、英棉現貨跌十點、期貨跌四五點、印棉期貨商賣出、多頭了結、歐洲出口商買進、其後套頭跨買、投機家買進、計平果爾跌〇·二五羅比、奧姆辣跌二·二五羅比、白羅溪跌二·五至三羅比、原電錄左、（五日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、六日白羅溪花之開盤預測、為一百九十二羅比、較上日收盤跌〇·七五羅比、</p>
<p>三品紗花均跌</p>
<p>六日大阪電、三品期紗跌一元八角　二元八角、近月為一八八元六角、遠月為一八八元在角、期棉跌五角五分至九角五分、近月為六〇元、遠月為五七元八角五分、</p>
<h3>糧食　期粉後市客銷發動</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤、各月份市面、呈初穩繼平之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、回好八分至一二角不等、故開價時、近遠市面、微好一分左右、入後因多頭回出、市面又見軟弱、不過各盤交易、因業內外之觀望、所以清淡、上午祇做十六萬包左右、迨至下午開盤、初尚平定、旋因近期粉北路客銷動辦、致買氣又步挺貴、六月份係新陳交接、亦見帶挺、七月份交易見稀、上落多云、</p>
<h3>麥價一漲其勢頓强</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份市面、出入無幾、交易亦未見暢、迨至下午開盤、初少交易、後因粉市回振、人心亦見引起、近遠各期、計漲五六分不等、後步觀察、陳麥因存底不豐、低落不易、六七月份、一半須看天時、半則於洋麥仍有關係耳、現麥開價、又見挺硬、高次各檔、又提高五分、開山東羊河漯河麥五元三角、常州麥五元二角七分、瑤灣麥五元二角九分、計二千五百包、由福新阜豐兩廠辦去云、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥、市况遲鈍平淡、農民方面與在運輸中加麥可見供給、計共二四四、五〇六、〇〇〇斛、</p>
<p>二十四年上海絲茶出口狀况</p>
<h3>食米銷塲平淡</h3>
<p>薄稻跌去角外</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、共到二十餘號、（貨共四千餘石）、零躉銷塲均懈、包胃僅青島龍口等帮辦去七八百包、故薄稻市况小去角外、蘇同粳仍以貨稀見定、南港則續貶五分、杜尖無上落、陰變元悉無市、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源三十四五艘、市上各貨銷路、白粳平淡、旱薄稻零銷略有交易、價趨定勢、羊埠尖零拆稍取、市價無甚上落、白元店胃續有去化、市况挺立、客尖去路呆滯、價稍轉軟、其餘各貨、市價與前相仿、</p>
<h3>客秈到源尚屬不絕</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、形勢轉軟、到頭只有九江與溫台州裝到四五千包、其他零星到頭與途貨亦連續不絕、而去化則南北均在觀望中、囤戶亦呆、祇有本街單帮活動、市面隨見轉居軟弱、統市祇有售開江西早晚米一千五百包、台州柳米百餘包、洋米擯守已久、昨開米彔高次共計二百五十包、均為本街辦去、行情與前市相近、但形勢則見軟云、</p>
<h3>連豆報小豆價略跌</h3>
<p>近日黃豆交易、祇有乍豆杜豆沙黃、廣汕本街雖尚有問津、但銷路亦减、市况平平而已、昨市做開各豆一千餘包、車豆價高胃呆、更以大連市况續挫、致人心不振、價見下跌、比較前市、計修角許、昨開蚌埠豆一車、正陽關豆一車、均由廠家採去、洋莊芝蔴、前日曾由達孚洋行辦去二百噸、價開十一元、大勢依然疲軟云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　紐約生絲實銷增加</h3>
<p>上月份紐約生絲存底報告、上海絲輸美較前月减退八百二十包、而美國上月實銷數目則較前月增加三千四百三十六包、茲將詳情列表如下、</p>
<h3>秀眉綠茶內銷活動</h3>
<p>近日綠茶市况、洋莊銷路頗形沉寂、珍眉珠茶等項、均無交易、英法行家日前發出電報、仍無回音、市情難望進展、惟低莊秀眉綠茶、內銷略見活動、天津福建等客帮頗多電採辦、連日由益隆源豐潤等茶棧、售出四百餘擔、扯價十一元三角、此項碎貨、存底日見稀少、一般茶商、因來源缺乏、人心較前堅硬、行情頗看漲之勢云、</p>
<h3>糖市　國產青糖又升二角</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、以關金略升、結價為二·二七〇、趨勢尚穩、公會劃盤二四粗砂白現貨二十二元七角、轉口貨六元六角、其餘東赤東白以及本廠綿白等、均無變動、惟荷粗白、洋行方面拋價微鬆、計天祥拋售即裝粗白三百噸、價為三元二角九分荷幣、又信益拋售即裝二百噸、較小一分、為三元八角、次之七角半至六角、比升二角、成交二百餘包、又建帮開出新刁青五百餘包、價九元七角、亦升二角、（昨報高枝洋之洋字係赤字之誤、合行更正、）</p>
<h3>南北貨　什路桂圓到貨仍稀</h3>
<p>什路桂圓、自紅盤漲價後、來源仍不見旺、實因存底確係稀薄所致、查昨瓊州輪入口、統僅到五十七件、其中小箱佔三十件、中箱十件、大箱十七件、總計不及五十擔、故趨勢依然堅定云、</p>
<h3>五金　芝蔴釘銷路暢旺</h3>
<p>芝蔴釘自本埠公勤廠出貨以來、舶來品來源因之减少、客帮家遇有需要、莫不採購該廠出品、故新春以來、銷路頗為繁盛、查前昨兩日、市場開出、共有二百百箱之多、行情三分三百包、每箱二十六元、四分二十一元、五分二十元、六分十九元、買胃以福建漢口兩帮為最暢、四川及西安等帮亦有辦去、惟天津北平以時局關係去路銳减、未免損色云、</p>
<h3>美會司鐵定價突漲</h3>
<p>昨日紐約來電、美國二百磅會司鐵、定價漲起美金七角、每箱售美金七元一角（上財富定出價每箱資金六元四角）故本埠市面、頗呈堅硬、異銀錢界放欵緊縮空氣、甚為濃厚、對於前途去路、未免大受影響云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　元芳呌貨元羽綢獨漲</h3>
<p>昨週四逢元芳洋行第二千九百七十五次呌莊、陳列排貨六十六箱、紅盤市况泰西緞較上期各見遜色、元絨上落甚微、直貢呢亦降低、惟元羽綢時交春令、容路見動、除花燭圖小七角、其餘皆升數角云、</p>
<h3>二十四年上海絲茶出口狀况</h3>
<p>去年上海生絲出口，據上海商品檢騐局蠶絲組報告，運往歐洲者二一，三六四包，比二十三年之一〇、二三四包。增加一一、一三〇包。美洲者二四、五三八包。比二十三年之五、二五五包。增加一九、二八三包。亞洲及非洲各口岸者九、一〇五包，二十三年之八，二一九包，增加八八六包。總計五五、〇〇七包，比二十三年之二三、七〇八包，增加三一、二九九包。</p>

<h3>血</h3>
<p>— 白</p>
<p>男的站在床前，撇開兩隻手，向女的哀求着。眼睛放出乞憐的光，幾乎哭下來了：「如果你還不相信，那我眞要自殺了！」</p>
<p>女的數着嘴，輕鄙地一笑：「哼！」一翻身，向着床裹睡了。手在床裏一面玻璃鏡上胡亂畫着，問道：一用手槍呢，用安眠藥水？還是用我們的廚刀？」她拚命地忍着笑，因為她現在該是生氣的樣子。</p>
<p>男的受了一擊，看見鏡裹那冷冷的面孔，不由兩手抱頭，揪住自己的頭髮，做出痛不欲生的樣子。可是女的眼睛閉上了。</p>
<p>男的猛然想起了廚刀，—就是女的所說的那廚刀。一掉頭，從房門縫裏望到當做廚房用的亭子間裏，在一張桌上放着一把明晃晃的廚刀，正射出一股冷冰冰的寒光。不由全身一冷，轉回頭來。</p>
<p>「　！……」他還沒有忘記在舞臺上慣用的那種表示多情和悲哀的顫音，輕輕地叫着。——可是她，沒有回響。呼吸的聲音更高了，做出睡着了的樣子。</p>
<p>男的聲音更慘了：「阿　！……阿蘭！……！」</p>
<p>她猛地一翻身，扳着臉：「我也沒有自殺，叫什麽！」</p>
<p>他窘得像一隻兎子，放低了聲音：一蘭，你果眞還不相信我嗎？」</p>
<p>「不相信！不相信！死也不相信！</p>
<p>大家都不響。</p>
<p>她氣虎虎地：「做老婆的只要每天有三頓飯吃，權利已經享盡了，還管人家什麽情人不情人？」</p>
<p>男的在床前屈着膝。「你眞相信我愛？她嗎？」</p>
<p>她擂着床邊。發急地叫：「我不管你這些屁事！別對我講！」</p>
<p>他放出更溫和的聲音：「阿蘭，你放心罷，無論如何，我是不會愛上她的！……」他等了一等，又說：「你不要多疑，在社會上交際，哪能避免與人接觸呢？……你只要相信我，……相信我就是了！……他自己都相信了自己的話，兩眼向天，雙手交握，彷彿是在向別人發誓，而胸中充滿了委屈似的。</p>
<p>她剛開口：「你？……」</p>
<p>他更柔聲地說下去：「比如說你自己罷，你的表哥……」他的心底一陣酸。「他和你那來親密，但我能懷疑你嗎？」</p>
<p>她心底一動，臉上頓時有點熱，急忙裏說不出話來。便劈頭駡了他一聲：「放屁！轉身又向床裏了。</p>
<p>他依然那末好脾氣地向她解釋：「阿蘭，你的毛病就是在太好懷疑！但是你錯了：你不該先懷疑別人；因為你該首先看我是否有什麽。……蘭，你該相信我啊！……」他像綿羊似的底叫。</p>
<p>「　！」太太冷笑一聲：「要我相價你，比要我相信自己死了還難！」她把床邊一拍：「我告訴你：我要睡覺，不許再同我說話！」把被頭一裹，倒向裏邊去了。</p>
<p>男的呆在床前了。</p>
<p>他想，想證明自已忠實的方法。</p>
<p>廚房裏的廚刀放出冰冷的寒光，靜靜地瞅着他。不由想起自己的話，便覺毛骨悚然。心一橫，衝到廚房裏，一把抓住了那把廚刀。</p>
<p>只可惜這廚刀的式樣太笨拙：柄子那末短，刀頭沒有尖子，方方的只像個剷子罷了！這使他懷念起在舞臺上演沙樂美中叙利亞少年用以自殺的那把匕首了：有着精美裝飾的柄子，尖錐形的刀鋒，向胸口握着，那是一種多英勇的氣槪啊！不覺鬆了手，廚刀便「拍」的一聲掉下地。他頽喪地走出亭子間。灰心地歎了一口長氣。</p>
<p>可是他不能就此安然於心。還到處找尋可以應用的東西。好，一把剪刀在梳洗臺下發着光。他一把就搶在手裏。—同時可又回頭看看床上的她，她還臉向裏睡着。——轉過身來，拔着那剪子看了半　。他在想：「哦，道是為了她修指甲特在先施公司買來的哩！」這是美國貨，式樣很漂亮，外面鍍了鎳，明晃晃地發着光。給它倒握在手裏，剪頭向裏，居然很像那匕首哩！</p>
<p>他試着向喉嚨刺去。但床上那位還向裏睡着，沒有聲息。</p>
<p>他呆了半嚮，覺得這剪子雖然漂亮，却不鋒利。這東西至多使人痛苦地流些血罷了，却不能滿足他的　求。他又歎氣了。</p>
<p>可是他依然不能够就此安心。——於楚在身體各部分尋找，末了，便找到大　裹側一塊有肉的地方。——他所以特別找道塊地方，並不是以不關要　為理由的；而是覺得：一來這地方很順手：二來這種事並不是故意向人炫耀的，不給人看見才表示出於眞心。——於是，他動手了；很小心地在左腿上剪了一下，可是肌肉有點彈性，滑掉了。他恨道剪子太不鋒利，便馬上叉使勁揑起肉，剪了一下。嘿，馬上起了一個三角形的傷痕！</p>
<p>他忍痛看着傷口，可是却不見流出血來，他失望了。剪子「拍」的　下地。</p>
<p>但是半分鐘後，一絲鮮紅的血從傷口流出來了。雖然那末細細的一絲，他仿佛看見了一股血的洪流，驚　地看着，也不拭去，讓它淌得史多更長一點。</p>
<p>於是：「啊呀！血……」他叫了：</p>
<p>他看見她把身子更向裹一轉，又睡了。並且在那面鏡子裏還現出一個披着嘴表示輕鄙的笑臉。——在他心頭上便澆了一盆冷水似的，呆了。</p>
<p>靜靜地過了一會兒工夫，男的便喪氣地倒在一隻椅子上。這一夜，他氣得沒有睡着。</p>
<p>床上的那一位呢，也沒睡，她在想：用什麽方法來報復他一下。</p>
<h3>塞外風雲</h3>
<p>— 櫻子</p>
<p>風像閣開了覊絆的野獸在沙漠的原野和塞外的城市發着在，冷酷的不僅打在人們臉上，身上，也打在人們心上，隨着天氣的冷勁，人們都像蟄伏着的軟體動物都不再動一動了。剩下來的大街上是些呼喚着爺爺奶奶的流浪人們。坐在家裏就安全了嗎？也許是！安全的是免得出去了凍壞了身子，手脚，或竟然不知覺中躺下去了。橫梗在大家心頭的却是那一個像天大的不安全的「？字疑問，知道「人家」幾時來呢？抬起頭望望天，天是靑靑的廣大的一片，像一個無涯的深海，早晨起來，還聽得見成羣的烏鴉咯咯聲和野孩子放起鴿子帶着「筒子」的嗡嗡聲，在淸新空氣中，十分響亮。</p>
<p>本地的報紙像被帶上了一套同一面具的玩偶人兒，那上面是刻板的政令，最多的是那些蒙古要人們的談話，塞外的風雲在這上面好像是麗日晴天，偶爾，也報吿着一些平穩的消息，就這樣，透露出來的還是「人家」已在佈置了，說不定什麽時候霹靂就會在十冬臘月的冷天中響起來，震過那些陷在身心的冷窖中的人們。</p>
<p>秘密中，人們一見面就會問！「　　！怎樣了呢？來不來？唉！唉！總還有一個「大年」過吧！」暗地裏，隨着「人家」的勢力，　　們活躍起來，做着千篇一律的勾當，太陽旂在城市的一隅高高飄揚，象微着這般人的得意。</p>
<p>該怎樣了呢！</p>
<p>一架拖着紅球尾巴的飛機照例的在靑靑天空上盤繞，飛得那麼低，會使你看見機中坐得是些什麼人，人們不知這些飛機是從那裏飛來，也不知飛向那裏去，只是咕嚕着！「該不會下蛋吧」？</p>
<p>隨着　　勢力的增長，人們在心的深處又投上了一個黑影，搬出了幾百年前的記憶：「呵！子兵是殘忍的哪」！那　汗殘殺的陰影，像一條鞭子，害怕的抽在人們心上。</p>
<p>「胡兒南下牧馬」咬文嚼字的人們心中也在想着：「那一天快要來到了呵」！</p>
<p>外路人的家眷都在慢慢往回搬了，塞外的人們可該向那裏搬呢？等着吧！過了一天算一天，塞外人是道地的「今朝：」主義者。</p>
<p>塞外的風雲是漸漸變了顏色呢！火靑山飛滿了雪花，一切都在靜待着那霹靂一聲！</p>
<h3>無題</h3>
<p>— 齊復</p>
<p>「我們今天出去演講哩，」姪兒興奮地告訴我，當他夜裏很晚回來的時候。</p>
<p>「臉紅了吧？」我帶笑地問。「有人聽嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的，這是我破題兒第一遭，不單臉紅，而且聲音也有點抖，但是，講上幾回就好了。聽的人倒有好幾百，有些人還特地央我們講呢。」</p>
<p>當姪兒帶着靑年人的熱誠和驕傲向我報吿的時候，近來多在回憶中生活着的我，深深的感到自己老了。</p>
<p>當五四運動——捲來的時候，我挾着同一樣的靑年的熱誠和驕傲，追逐著浪花前去。「三八」的血的喊聲傳來，我也興奮地跟着同學們作處女的宣傳演講了。在五卅時代的隊伍中間，開始領悟到羣衆的偉大，開始得着「萬衆一心」之感。在「六二三」身濺的血跡更像受戒者的烙痕一樣，習在我的生命裹。以後也曾在萬千的旗幟下歛着氣息，在雷動的喊聲中聳着毛管，然而那已經不是在中國了。</p>
<p>這一切現在已成了歷史的陳跡，靑春背著我逝去，偉大的波濤的澎湃聲也漸漸的遠了，遠了。</p>
<p>平穩地聲無奧地，「九一八」和「一二八」度過幾個不平穩的年頭，連「五四」時代三八時代的殭屍也終於復活了，並且以新的更猙獰的面孔復活了。然而在牠們的面前也一樣的流着血，而且血還是首先塗濺着那有悲壯的歷史的墳墓似的古城，流的還是那熱誠而驕傲的靑年的血，——縱然已是第二代的靑年了。</p>
<p>雖說秀才造反，三年不成，然干政的學子以善於誹謗之故，從古就是執政者的背上的芒刺，不拔便不痛快。東漢末年禁錮的太學生，明末誅鋤的東林復社，都注定了同一的命運。是的，老一代的人們的口中，罷課游行一類的行為就不是頑童的惡作劇，也是不安本分的盲動。——縱然他們中也有些，曾親自幹過這樣可惡的事，但是，此一時彼一時呵！——不過在他們的心中決這决不是單純的惡意的兒戲，而是可以激動歷史的水磨的渦流。在一七八九年的法國，摧破巴士的獄的巴黎羣衆和逼着路易十六由凡爾賽回到巴黎的飢餓的婦女隊伍，在當時貴族的眼中，甚至一些歷史家的筆底，不是也一樣兒戲似的搗亂嗎？在殖民地裹，這樣的大伙兒逃學，不是有差不多同樣嚴重的影響嗎？</p>
<p>當然，偉大的運動不是靠這樣來完成，但是，偉大的運動往往是以由這樣來開始。</p>
<p>老了的只是個人，整個人類社會的歷史卻不斷的以靑春的活力更新和前進。</p>
<h3>我還有一隻眼睛</h3>
<p>— 張春橋</p>
<p>起來吧，你憤怒着的妖隸</p>
<p>燃燒吧，你被壓軋的煤層</p>
<p>怒吼吧，我親愛的弟兄，</p>
<p>請你暫時在這里坐一霎，</p>
<p>不要說這地方實在黯暗得可怕，</p>
<p>汚黑的泥土會沾毀你的衣裝</p>
<p>還有瞇眼的塵沙。</p>
<p>是的，這是座大廟，</p>
<p>活在這里簡直是到墳墓了，</p>
<p>貓頭鷹叫着一串凄凉，</p>
<p>凄凉的歌聲伴着神像，</p>
<p>枯老的古柏啞然無聲，</p>
<p>大風的翅膀搧不回他的生命。</p>
<p>可是，你得知道有時辰光，</p>
<p>這地方騷亂得像海邊，</p>
<p>那是廟會或什麽紀念，</p>
<p>人們在這里舉行盛宴，</p>
<p>我淸楚地知道這地方，</p>
<p>像知道我還只有一隻眼。</p>
<p>（你如果不相信，</p>
<p>劃支火柴看一看—</p>
<p>一隻吐著亮光，</p>
<p>那隻却失去了火熖。）</p>
<p>說來離今已經很逮，</p>
<p>一個嚴寒的冬天，</p>
<p>我們的　駐在上海，</p>
<p>一條大路隔成兩儸世界，</p>
<p>一邊，憤怒的我們，</p>
<p>武裝的敵人站在對面。</p>
<p>槍筒對準敵人，</p>
<p>心頭像火苗歡躍，</p>
<p>只要一聲吶喊，</p>
<p>炸彈熔化了冰團。</p>
<p>冬天的街頭分外寂冷，</p>
<p>幢幢的房舍閃着鬼影，</p>
<p>黑茫茫的天邊響起槍聲，</p>
<p>虬江路，寳山路，成了火把</p>
<p>一霎時滿天燃燒得通紅，</p>
<p>起來吧，你憤怒者的奴隸，</p>
<p>燃燒吧，你被壓軋的煤層，</p>
<p>我們像一羣瘋在的野獸，</p>
<p>血花燙醒了敵人的夢！</p>
<p>不能忘記的是那些兄弟們，</p>
<p>愛的鐵鍊，握得手疼，</p>
<p>他們是工人，農人，學生，</p>
<p>我們就是大兵！</p>
<p>托起槍，耳邊廂響着：</p>
<p>「衝呀！保衛我們的弟兄！</p>
<p>但是我傷了，瞎了一隻眼睛</p>
<p>我們被關在醫院里，</p>
<p>每顆心繫在戰場。</p>
<p>「不准問，不准看報，</p>
<p>不准想那些事情。」</p>
<p>敵人的飛機軋軋地響了，</p>
<p>我們又被抬到後方。</p>
<p>後來，聽說：「停戰了！」</p>
<p>眞他奶奶個　！</p>
<p>這明明是瞎話，</p>
<p>我們那里會失敗，</p>
<p>我們有着無數的弟兄！</p>
<p>從那，我瞎了，瞎了一隻眼睛，</p>
<p>出來醫院，</p>
<p>就住在這古老的廟中。</p>
<p>從朝到夜，從夜到朝，</p>
<p>我盼望有一天，</p>
<p>敵人被驅逐出境，</p>
<p>每天我踟躅在舊日的戰場，</p>
<p>一片殘破的房屋，臥着，</p>
<p>像一隻笨拙的老熊。</p>
<p>斜斜的石柱，塊塊的白骨，</p>
<p>一切還像昨天的事情。</p>
<p>我的哥哥埋在這里了，</p>
<p>王得勝埋在這里了，</p>
<p>這里還埋了張金鐘。</p>
<p>一天天這家動土了，</p>
<p>那家又動工。</p>
<p>於今已恢復惜日狀况，</p>
<p>于今，却沒有憤怒的槍聲！</p>
<p>起來吧，你憤怒的奴隸！</p>
<p>燃燒吧，你被壓軋的煤層！</p>
<p>怒吼吧，我親愛的弟兄！</p>
<p>我雖只剩一隻眼睛，</p>
<p>這世界却看得分明，</p>
<p>只有燒起火把，</p>
<p>鐵的鎖鍊不會斷鬆！</p>
<p>瞪着這隻眼，</p>
<p>我高唱着一個天明！</p>
<h3>奇怪的木匠</h3>
<p>— 歐陽山</p>
<p>用不着證明的，有許多人糟踏了生活：用他們底苟且，私心，和懶惰。而有許多人却是被生活所糟踏了的。生活是人類創造出來的，——憑了道點，所以牠美妙。可是果然如此麼？當牠被欺騙的大網裹纏起來而一直向罪惡的洞底下墜，牠便會緊挾着多少人物一同落下……道難道不是醜惡，謬悖，可恥的錯誤麼？……</p>
<p>奇怪的沈佳是一個年輕，性情和善，技術巧妙的木匠。——是的，誰都知道的，在官福巷有過一個這樣的木匠。顴骨和牙齒都向外突出，臉長而小，短的黑頭髮一把大的毛刷子似地豎在頭上，眼睛不大明朗，罩着很粗的紅絲絡。壯健，爽快，沒有結婚，入迷地愛者任何人家的小孩子。</p>
<p>他說：</p>
<p>「會做椅子，棹子——這算不得一個木匠！刻花瓶座子，刨槍托，是頂不知羞的玩意兄！」</p>
<p>他底老板王福來回答他道：</p>
<p>「沒有道個道理。聽我底指揮的人個個都是木匠！什麽，——『我不高興做這個，這個我做不來，」分明都是錯的。我底話對了。」</p>
<p>王福來是一個著名的會賭白鴿票土著有錢佬，非常懂得刻扣伙計底利益。</p>
<p>沈佳是最不專心，最不起勁的僱工之一。他在王禍來面前叫他吃驚地打着長長的呵欠，好像長年長月都沒有睡過好覺。在刨木凳上睡着了，簡直要他底老板舉起布鞋子踢醒他。「你不打算在我這里做下去了？」</p>
<p>「你難道不能够給我一點獎勵麽？」他回答。好像王福來做了一件十分對不起他的事，而他已經慨然寬恕了他，為了表不好意才老實地說下去：「我知道你遲早會歇了我底生意。可是眞地這樣做了，你知道你會把我餓死的　」</p>
<p>王福來每天給他加了兩分錢的工錢。他是服從了一句俗語：「好東西不便宜，便宜東西不好」的。沈佳底顴骨更加向外突出，而且鮮紅，閃着油光，表示自己的高興了。</p>
<p>但是不上兩個月他重復懶散萎頽下去。</p>
<p>他底頭沉思地傾側起來，上下唇扭歪地裂開着——誰都相信因為牠們曾經努力要包住那些牙齒，結果成了這樣的。</p>
<p>「你看呀，我簡直不像這樣的人。——不是無頓得對不起東家了麽？」</p>
<p>他咆哮着，把他底精神現象向叔父沈澤之訴說。沈澤之是一個毫無出息的鴉片烟精，臉靑灰，兩肩常常怕冷似地縮起來，嘴唇很大而向外捲。</p>
<p>「好，讓我來看看你是一個怎樣的人。」</p>
<p>他一聲不響地在房間裏徘徊着，拿起衣服，茶杯，精細地翻來覆去地看，放在鼻子前面嗅，於是過了十幾分鐘，他慢吞吞地向侄兒沈佳要求道：</p>
<p>「現在，給我一點錢吧。」只在接受了同屋住的或隣居的招請和定貨的時候，他是高興而熱心的，完全恢復了靑春的活力。</p>
<p>他在店裏拿了木料，灰油，漆，額料和其他各種傢生回家，不讓王福來曉得。他這樣做是痛苦的。為着除此之外無從獲得的某種愉快，他這樣做了，而他也能够估計那些材料在老板底打算之下食値得多少錢。</p>
<p>他替別人做了許多碗櫃，方椅，鷄籠，矮凳，盆架，而完全沒有獲得酬報。還經常地應了他們底叫喚去修補什麽東西，像衣櫃，八仙桌，板帳，神樓之類。有一次甚至完全重新油過了一付棕色的門扇。</p>
<p>他們有時請他喝兩百錢雙蒸。</p>
<p>「眞是，——怎麽過得意呢？」</p>
<p>「我沒有為你做過。我是為了我自己的。」</p>
<p>他這樣回答所有的人。</p>
<p>他底巧妙的構想和眞實的能力表現於他所試做出來的玩具，和一些很像玩具却不能指定做什麽用的東西。這二十多　的年輕木匠用鋸子，刨刀，挖刀，鏇刀，鐵錘這些粗笨的傢伙。做成有些的確很有趣的物。</p>
<p>小小的房間裏黑晴到即使在白天也要點燈，陳列滿了他底工作底成績。其中有幾樣他自己出於眞心地喜歡的：一個大的木盤裏面擺着各種木頭做的小生物，人，牛，狗，馬；隨他底意思，可以變換各個的位置，一樣在別一樣後面追趕，或牽着，咬着，或扭打着。從一塊木頭彫刻出來的兩個人，一男一女，他們底腦袋和四肢都是活動的，因此可以互相親密地摟抱，也可以互相兇狠地毆鬥。一隻長頸高髻的雪白的鵝，皮層可以揭開，裹面有塗了顏色的內臟，——這是從雙門底大街一家書店櫉窗裹陳列的某種橫剖的動物標本得了暗示而摹擬成的。在牆壁上有一幅舞獅圖，只完成了一部份，是用墨筆先畫出來，再用塗了彩色的木條，本片，和鐵片，碎玻璃　成的。——店裹放工回來，他就在房間裏一聲不響地工作着，玩弄着。</p>
<p>他把即使最心愛的東西當做禮物送給一些小孩子，和他很熟的或毫不相干的，甚至只是過路的。</p>
<p>粗糙，生硬，但是豐富的才能，這木匠給自己找出了這樣的消費牠的方法。</p>
<p>抽大烟的叔父沈澤之來了，和他爭吵了兩個鐘頭。他要求沈佳給他幾樣玩具拿去換錢，被沈佳嚴厲地拒絕了。</p>
<p>沈澤之把老板王福來帶到姪兒底房間裏，那是不多幾天以後的事。王福來在那里號叫着恰像一隻受傷的公猪，哭出眼淚來，並且打毀了那里所有的物件，——本來屬於他的或並不屬於他的。……</p>
<p>那倒霉的木匠沈佳在被革退的兩個月之後，跑到廣西一家小錫礦公司做小工去了。</p>
<h3>關於新詩創作諸問題</h3>
<p>— 雷石楡</p>
<p>最近在一些報紙上，關於新詩的諸問題，似乎頗熱鬧爭論過，但到現在為止，還沒有人對新詩的創作諸問題，具體地，正確地作過有系統的詩論，許多詩作者或詩人因零星的見解而不知誰是誰非依然懷疑着創作的目標和創作活動。其實詩也和小說一樣（當然形式上，技術的表現上是不同的）不能以一種機械的形式當作一個毫不變化的模型去呌人倣製；牠也不過是反映時代的意識，社會的現實的一種文學工具，時代和社會不是一個卵子，因此詩的要素也不能分析為蛋黃（　）蛋白（　）蛋殼等各若干　　。就單以形式來說，古代的歌謠型，封建的韻律型，資本主義的自由律型，以及新興的無定律型，可以看出詩的發展的過程上如何地變化着，正如歷史的變化一樣。</p>
<p>現實無疑是在變化着，但牠不是單純地，規則的地赤赤裸地可以拿進實騐室裏像解剖一個兎子或分析一杯水的成分那麽簡單的，因為單看表面的現象而不能把握或深深的理解含有多樣性和複雜關係的現實的本質，就很容易歪曲了現實。（當然也有人故意歪曲現實，因為暴露現實的本質等於暴露他本身一階層的醜惡和倒霉的命運一樣）因此，作為一個進步的詩人，企圖把握或推動歷史的必然走向的路綫和表現從現實反映自己的並不「純情」的情緒，世界觀的正確認識，和意識形態的鍜鍊是非常必要的。但為了藝術的形象化地表現活生生的現實，或加强威動大衆的情緒時，形式和技巧的運用是不能忽視的。</p>
<p>正因為現實社會不是一個不孵化的卵子（就是這樣的一個卵子也有變化的，不過並無發展），絕，律，古等的韻律型已隨我們的辮子詩人進了墳墓，紳士資產階級的「胡適之體」也只好存在於少數人的西裝口袋裏（但穿西裝的人未必通都高興把「胡適之體」放在口袋裏），因為我們現在需要更具體的，更眞實的，更悲壯的，更飛躍的表現。在目前，我們用怎樣有效的方法來表現，和怎樣才最有效果地獲取表現的方法，這是値得而且迫切的討論的課題。</p>
<p>輾轉於最悲慘的生活和最殘忍的壓迫下，而文化敎養又最低下而至全無的中國的大衆，以及無恥地拉着帝國主義的拐杖鞭撻，宰割和奴隸大衆的一切掛牌或不掛牌的漢奸……正是我們要表現的對象。同時因為我們是站在大衆層裹，作為大衆的歌手，是不能忽視同時又不能不研究適應大衆的視覺和聽覺而瞎拉的。</p>
<p>不過，一二年來新詩的發展太使人悲觀了，不但沒有一冊可算作代表的詩雜誌，就是較進步的而且經常出版的也沒有一個，就是各報紙上和各文藝雜誌上發表的一些詩作品，也實在使人失望的居多。這並不是沒有進步的詩人寫詩，我相信，這一定蹂躪了不少有用的作品。同時一方面因為沒有鼓舞和給發表的機會，影響不少詩作者悲觀和怠惰，一些略有聲譽的詩人，不轉向便個別地活動，不為詩壇的發展去發掘新詩人，脫離了大衆的活動也產生不出好詩，於是新詩的發展前途和出路就愈益慘澹下去了。</p>
<p>不過，我也不吾認政治和經濟的摧殘與窘迫。其實正因為這樣，我們要更技術地更艱苦地加强奮鬬。</p>

<h3>德國的第二顆炸彈</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>德國自毀棄凡爾賽和約，實行重整軍備以後，已如出押之虎，睥睨一切，使歐洲各國，僉具戒心。但德國的重整軍備，只是向世界投擲的第一顆炸彈。現在德國的第二顆炸彈，又將爆發。希特勒已在準備進行索還舊殖民地，及恢復萊茵河區域武裝。希氏擬在四月間，舉行公民投票，以兩項問題，付公民表决。問題為：（一）德國人民是否需要殖民地？（二）萊茵河區域恢復武裝之舉，是否與德國的尊嚴相適應？此種公民表决，大足以說明德國今後的動向。</p>
<p>德國近年來對於先前的舊殖民地，每念念不能忘。希氏在各國的演說中，時作露骨的表示，謂德國不願永遠放棄舊殖民地。最近他在慕爾里，對國社黨大學的學生講演，說歐洲國家有殖民海外之權，德國現已十分强固，無需國聯援助，且無需條約或盟約，殖民地係以强權取得者。德國爭取殖民地的决心，於此可見。對於此一要求，日當局頃曾宣稱，日代管地，實無歸還德國的理由。不知希氏今後將採何種的方式，索回舊殖民地。是否要用强權爭取，以達其目的呢？</p>
<p>至恢復萊茵河區域武裝，近據法國方面所傳，德國已在該處秘密敷設「空中的興登堡陣綫，」準備第二次侵入法國。並謂該處所有最新式的機塲，均有防禦炸彈的地底停機室，每室可容飛機百架。該綫自北海直達瑞士邊境。尚有第二綫，亦為類似的飛機塲，其地點適可供給第一綫在策略上後退之用。對於在萊茵河非武裝區域，重新設防一事，德國不但不否認，且曾盡力宣傳。現在此問題已引起法國的重視，此次參加英國故皇奉安典禮的法外長佛蘭亭，已與英外相艾登，討論應付德國的辦法。英國雖認德國此舉，尚無迫切的危險，但於法國預事戒備的政策，則已準備援助。此外，比國與法輔事相依，亦表示同情法國的政策。並决定在慕斯河沿岸，由毗近德國的利愛治城起，至法國的邊疆止，設置防務工事。意國方面，法前總理賴伐爾，在辭職之前，亦一度與之接洽。意當局卽聲明，德國如果違反和約條項，意國的兵力，足以應付事變。似此，歐洲局勢，目下又呈緊張的狀態，前途頗難樂觀。</p>
<p>希特勒志在建設第三德國，自執政以還瞬屆三載。雖德國本身，日臻强盛。但世界和平，則已感受莫大的威脅。</p>
<h3>關於年畫</h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>民間過舊曆新年，除聚集家人父子暢叙天倫，儘情遊樂之外，大概都還有個更重要的意義，就是大家在遊樂之餘，還要求個吉利的兆頭，以求一年的幸福，和牲畜的平安；只看家戶戶大門居室上頭貼的紅紙春聯，卽甚明白。此外，畫攤上賣的各色年畫，也可從畫上的顏色用意上看出這意義的痕跡。知堂老人是很善談年畫的，他曾經用帶着嘲諷的情感說幾屬這類意義的年畫都是載道的「厭勝畫」，為士大夫的陳腐思想的表現。知堂老人的話，自然有其自己的感慨而發的，未必就眞心來挖苦思想，生活都很簡拙的鄉下人。鄉下人一年苦作到頭，一天兩頓有粥可啜已是不正容易，叨着千百年代因襲下來的風習，纔得在新年裏閑散幾天。他們所期望的當然是更望以後，日子能够舒順點過去為此而已。</p>
<p>還有個孫福熙先生也寫過于年畫的文章，也談得很有趣。他原係畫家，以畫家的情感來談年畫，自然又有他自己獨特的見解。不過，姑無論這些年畫其為風雅藝術畫，或載道的「厭勝畫」，可確是民間過新年的新鮮的點綴品。至在玩樂之餘還不能忘懷祈福，用心可是極其慘淡的。生的要求原為人類本能所賦，載道的年畫也是民間的生存要求的一種呼呌表示，思想縱使陳腐，其當初的動機倒無可非議。</p>
<p>說到故鄉的年畫，倒不普遍。這個原因或許是故鄉人短少一種創造自己的通俗藝術的才能之故，比如唱戲一道，故鄉人就沒有足供自己可唱可演的戲文。舊曆新年的縣城上南門一帶，雖然是賣畫的市塲，但這些畫可與普通所說的年畫完全兩樣；都是從上海販回來的美人畫山墨畫之類。鄉下人買不起鏡屏大畫，只好求其價廉好看的，買得一二幅掛在房間壁上，也算一種新鮮的壁飾。倒像頗能欣賞風雅藝術。不過在求吉利方面，新年仍然要貼春聯，而且貼的又大又講究，兩隻大門板上也貼鍾馗像，說這張鐘馗畫像就是故鄉人的眞正年畫也無不可，因除此以外，實沒有他種可說的。至以老鼠嫁女，也只有口頭上的描說，究竟如何情景，可沒有要去畫出來給人家看。</p>
<p>兒時對于畫攤上的美人畫，雖然覺得花花綠綠，很是好看，也只能偶爾站到面前看看，買是買不起的。有時大人們買來的又給早早掛到壁上。值得提一提的還是二十三送灶時挾在奏詞裏的那張小紙片的木刻板畫，刻的是騎着白馬的灶君老爺，後面有一個招財童子跟着走。紙張已極粗劣，刻板也每每模糊不眞。然而那時已覺得珍貴極了，常常背人把它揭下藏着玩，雖然祖母已說過沒有這隻小白馬，灶君老爺會上不得天，也管不了許多。</p>
<p>關于年畫，別的還是勿說，而想起故鄉的小孩子們之少有玩具可玩，可不能不說是兒童的情趣智慧的培養啟發上的一種殺害了。</p>
<h3>庇寒所里</h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>天還祇有朦朦亮，外面走廊里就有一種聲音在呌喊了；那是管理員在呌守護們起身。</p>
<p>篷子里還是漆黑的，雖然從蘆蓆隙里漏進來幾縷灰白色的曙光，但終於沒有把篷子里的黑暗趕走。</p>
<p>那一間溢的篷子里，橫七直八地躺着四五百個貧民，全像一羣猪仔似的在舖着的稻草上擠着，一種難聞的氣息跟着一陣鼾散在篷子里面醖釀。</p>
<p>我在一個黑暗的角落里睜開眼來望望，只有睡在我不遠的那個光頭兒，一夜到天亮總聽見他在咳嗽吐痰，那些年輕的人，常常從夢中驚醒過來對他咕嚕着：</p>
<p>「這樣老的年紀還要活着現什麼世呢？」</p>
<p>聽聽外面的聲音比剛才嘈雜了，知道這班當守護的傢伙已經「上班」。我也因為實在無法再睡了，便撑着一個僵硬的肢體，從一塊破了十多個窟窿絮中爬了起來；看看躺在我脚邊的那個傢伙，却還睡得像一條死猪，我用力蹴了他幾脚也不見他醒來。</p>
<p>昨夜的冷勁眞可利害，我一整夜身上不曾溫暖過，况且躺在我脚邊的那個傢伙又會搗蛋，一忽兒翻身，一忽兒小溲的，眞討厭，今晚我再不要和他合被絮了—可是，那些守護們的籐條子也眞捱受不下。</p>
<p>我只要一提起那些守護們，就生了氣；他們臂彎里纏着一塊紅布，手里拿着一根籐條子，就像北方的大刀隊似的擺起丘八大爺的架子來。其實他們猴兒做官，還不是和我們一樣的出身。貧民，大家全是貧民，何必這樣勢利！左右他們只不過有了幾斤氣力，輕了幾歲年紀，要是我老子再小十年年紀的話，餓死也不會到這種地獄似的地方來活受罪。</p>
<p>照我的性子起來，眞要把這些小王八扭來揍一頓，敎訓他們一回，才能够出我一口臭氣，但是不成，他們人多，并且管理員們也會把我攆出去的。</p>
<p>想着，自家的小溲可在作梗了，於是摸着黑壁站起來，在一個一個躺着的人身上跨出去，有時踮着了他們的身體也只好讓他們罵幾句：</p>
<p>「要死的，你瞎了眼烏珠唦」！自己可不去理睬他們。</p>
<p>篷子里漸漸地放些亮光了，廊簷下的脚步聲已開始忙碌了起來，躺在稻草面上的同伴也一个一个地坐起了身子。</p>
<p>「洗臉去」！那個獄卒似的守護，伸進一個股袋來喊了一聲，於是大家全蹌蹌踉踉地蜂擁到了一個院子里去。</p>
<p>院子中間的蘆蓆棚底下，擺着三木桶熱水，許多人全爭先地去洗臉。年輕力壯的擠在面前，老弱的人和孩子們却被軋落在背後，等到他們都洗過了才輪得到我們這些老年人。因此，每次當我去洗的時候，水已變成了泥漿，揩布也發黑了；又冷又髒，我眞不願說。然而不洗又不行，管理先生會罵我不懂衛生的。</p>
<p>洗過了臉，接着就是早餐的時候了；大家都聚集在廊下等候着，一個個灰青的面孔上，都有一種饑餓的色彩在閃動！</p>
<p>照例，第一個篷子里的早餐是先吃—每次是這樣—這時一陣一陣的粥香跟着西北風吹過來，使得我們這一羣全站在那兒咕嚕咕嚕的嚥着唾沫子；喉嚨頭彷彿有什么小虫在爬動似的，覺得十分難過，只有早點送過粥來，好來塡滿這肚子里的空虛。</p>
<p>當每餐六大木桶粥送到我們面前後，不消幾分鐘工夫就會搶得精光的，這雖然是鹽蘿葡和細米粥，可是在我們吃起來眞是比了什么白米飯大酒席還要難得。</p>
<p>吃過了早餐，仍舊到籩子里去躺着或坐着望午餐。</p>
<h3>開河</h3>
<p>— 張嚴</p>
<p>冬天，潮水低落的時候，這條官道的要塞—出城廂的吊橋下往往排擠着來往的船隻。半槁子子來的河水，可以清晰地看清楚的河底的淤泥和石塊；而沿兩岸的河灘脚，被常年傾倒着的垃圾堆積起來，河心顯得更狹小了。每天午牌時分，從四分鄉到縣城來，或是從縣城開往四鄉的船隻，都要經過這扼要的中心，吊橋下；但是淺狹的河心把牠們關塞起來，後面來的船隻假使不肯退讓，大家船頭對船頭堅持着，許多時候船隻不能移動一步，吵鬧的聲音郤拉住了吊橋上來往的行人。</p>
<p>這種情形傳到紳董的耳朵里，他們就非正式地在一個席面上討論到這件事了。本來，這條官道規定五年開一次河，由值年的主持着（自然也是紳董之一）形式地召集開會，大家通過之後，就是攤捐簿沿門挨戶捐錢，那些領銜的紳董們在首頁都是幾十元一個地排列着，使得較大的商店，和中上之之愛不好意思寫出過少的數目；於是每一個值年的紳董都可以在這官道上撈到一筆逛私娼的特別費。</p>
<p>但是現在還輪不到五年開次河的規定時間，非正式談判的結果，大家表面上用「便利交通，維持商業」的大題目發揮了像煞有介事的大議論，而那位縣長的舅爺，大家稱呼他仲翁的，也就是此次召集「席面」的主人，更帶笑帶正經地說起現在市面不景氣，五年一次要求各商家捐錢已屬困難的事，上次開河迄今祇有兩年有零，雖然他們知道河道的交通和他們的營業有密切的關係，但在年底關頭，要各商家分担這筆意外的開河捐，恐怕是不易容的事吧？最後他說到正題，他想到縣里去設法一筆公費，各位紳董也多捐一點，「這是做好事啊」！那位伸翁鷺鷺似的笑了起來。</p>
<p>這提案在「席面」上博得許多掌聲及諂媚的詞語，仲翁很滿意自已的對於這件事鼾適當。因為由他到縣里去設法公費，這額外的一次開河自然可以由他來主持，一筆「穔塘」又是穩穩到手，但是那些紳董們并不比仲翁愚笨，誰都想用全力來爭這次開河的主持人，然而要到縣里去設法公費，一個都沒有這路子，所以一方面贊成仲翁的提案，由他安心去設法公費，從仲翁家里出來他們合組又開了一個會議，他們的抵禦方法是先下手接洽投私服的工頭，做了一個圈套讓仲翁自己鑽進來，然後他們聯合具名</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>動工開河。</p>
<p>仗着舅爺的面子，公費是順利地弄到手了，仲翁自然又備了一席酒招待那些紳董把。席面上仲翁運用着外交的手腕籠絡他們，表面上大家是擁護仲翁做此次開河的主持人了。於是第二天城廂上張貼了投標的告示。</p>
<p>年底將近，官河是出進的要道，仲翁就主張先行壩河，三天之後，投標結束了馬上可以動工的。但是第二個三天過去了還是沒有投標的，縣里馬上接到各商家聯合具呈公函，這自然是不利於仲翁的，雖然仲翁到縣長家里奔走了數次，還是由各紳董來街辦這次開河的事宜了。</p>
<p>當第一天開河動工的時候，各位紳董都一早到城廂上來觀望，他們的笑容在陽光下是那樣的飽滿，雖然還有人暗下想法子把份頭减少，使自家可以多撈一點外快。</p>

<p>小魯：他們怎麼說呢？</p>
<p>大哥：他們說，大水鬧得很快，一個夜裏就湮没了七八個邨莊，他們本來住在上縣的邊境的，現在家裏全被大水湮了，所以昨天連夜的逃到我們這兒來了。</p>
<p>阿巧：（驚訝）哎呀：我們這兒是本縣的邊境呀，不是非常的危險嗎？</p>
<p>大哥：不危險的話，我幹麼發愁呀？小魯：那麼我們怎麼辦呢？趕快的逃走吧！</p>
<p>大哥：逃走？逃到那兒去呀！逃是饿死！不逃是湮死！反正是個死！</p>
<p>阿巧：不是有賑災的來放糧嗎？何況我們還有半桶米呢！</p>
<p>大哥：不錯有是有的，知道他們幾時來放呢？不用說捐到的錢，就是十足的放出來，好幾縣的人夠多少，一定會挨＃你也有份兒嗎？至於這僅僅的半桶米，萬一可以維持我們一家子幾口的話，可是旁的人將要饿死得時候，你就不帮助了嗎？這樣一來，危險不是馬上就會來的嗎？</p>
<p>小魯：那麼那些放振的人爲什麽這樣呢的？</p>
<p>大哥：他們爲了面子的關係，不得不裝模裝樣的來走一趟維持面子，至於他們的良心，是不是讓什麽狗給吃了去，那我也不知道了。</p>
<p>阿巧：那爲什麽呢？難道說他們自己不也是肉做的人心嗎？</p>
<p>大哥：（微笑）因為他們自己需要更好地日子過呀，你餓死不餓死管他們什麽事呀！</p>
<p>老五：（著急）他媽的，就懂得吃飽了來收租，堤壞了修都不修，大水若是眞的来了，他們不也是一樣是湮死或者逃難嗎？</p>
<p>大哥：他們老早就得到消息了堤子不修，他們自己還不知道危險嗎？告訴你們，湮死地人裏他們是不會有份兒的！</p>
<p>小魯：那麼，您說怎麼辦呢？我們是不是先逃走哩？</p>
<p>大哥：沒告訴你嗎？逃也是死，不逃也是死嗎？</p>

<p>碌碌風塵枉徒勞。人生快樂最為高。須知快樂人間寶。切不可，樂極生悲喊苦惱。有一個，誤入歧途的聰明輩。連連呵欠話嘵嘵。到說道，萬般皆下品。惟有吃烟膏。快樂如何把雅片烟燒。我是，有槍階級人人曉。癮君子三字姓名標。來了個，氣味相投的知己友。烟霞待客品清高。一榻横陈情蜜蜜。三筒下肚楽淘淘。無窮快樂無窮趣。所以是，四海馳名叫福壽膏。有了他時，胸中積#齊消散。振作精神興倍豪。有了他時，一夜不眠何妨事。談天說地達通宵。而且能醫肝胃氣。十年老病一齊消。惜乎常吸能成癮。半月功夫已套牢。我是，一日無他難過活。少抽一頓就一團糟。四肢無力淚雙拋。卜晝卜夜常寢饋。高枕無憂吹橫蕭。水果蜜餞常端正。雲南拖西邊還要冷籠燒。手段精通黃鬆高。到說道，留得家財無所用。一到無常萬事拋。到如今，薄薄田園消耗盡。只落得，身輕康泰樂逍遙。懶惰成性成廢物。只好興，畢三叫化軋大淘。那時懊悔已遲了。</p>

<p>元宵何物最移情。唯聽喧天鋼鼓聲。陽歷元宵音寂寂。元宵陰歷鬧殷勤。但只見，紅男綠女相追逐。驚侶低呼妹與兄。只見那，一片春光晴暖處。和風　拂送啼鶯。轉盼間，柳岸綠楊人意爽。繁華都市耀春城。又只見，通衢潮湧飛裙屐。燈彩光華五色生。但聽那，絃管笙歌珠萬斛。銀花綻蕊月三更。玉漏停催塵馬去。霓裳按曲謳昇平。君不見，今故爭傳城不夜。上元佳是今辰。富麗堂皇競鬥寶。只可惜，虛糜金錢枉精神。只是那，翠袖飛揚香馥郁。迷人欲醉笑盈盈。星球初入人間照。火樹幔天觸目驚。此際是，詩人尋韻興偏饒。雅士推敲費短評。只是那，離亂荒邨伴野徑。一無情緒對寒警。雖然，九十春光始此日。可奈，國家多事起雄爭。余欲無言情引去。竊學南陽隴畝耕。一竿消遣釣澄泓。</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Reviews Issuance of Two New Government Bonds</h3>
<p>Passed First Review and Submitted to the Yuan for Discussion</p>
<p>Nanjing. The Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a meeting at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th to review the proposal to issue the Unified and Reconstruction Government Bonds. Ma Yinchu and more than ten other people attended. Xu Kan and Dong Puming from the Ministry of Finance were present to explain. As a result, it has been passed as is and submitted to the Yuan for discussion on the 7th. According to Ma, the Unified Government Bonds are to be used to redeem old bonds in order to safeguard credit and the interests of bondholders, so the interest rate is still set at 6% per week. The interest rate on the Reconstruction Government Bonds will be reduced to 5% to avoid future losses to the government. It is expected that interest rates on industrial and commercial loans will also be reduced accordingly, which will greatly benefit the relief of industry and commerce. However, the market price of the Reconstruction Government Bonds is expected to be slightly lower. (6th Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Nanjing. According to sources familiar with financial circles, China's annual customs revenue is approximately 300 million yuan, of which 100 million yuan has been designated as collateral for foreign debt, and the majority of the remainder has been designated as a fund for principal and interest payments on domestic debt. It is estimated that the Inspectorate General of Customs must allocate 15 million yuan per month to the National Debt Fund Management Committee, etc. However, customs revenue is currently deficient, and the government must supplement an average of 4 million yuan per month to cover the principal and interest payments on domestic debt. Although the shortfall in customs revenue is a temporary fact, balancing revenue and expenditure is ultimately a permanent goal. Therefore, the government has decided to issue the Unified and Reconstruction Government Bonds to avoid the need for monthly subsidies, which would affect the national treasury. In the first two years, it is estimated that 11 million yuan per month will be allocated from customs revenue as a fund for principal and interest payments on the aforementioned two government bonds. After two years, customs revenue will gradually increase in the future, which should be sufficient to pay this fund for a long time, without any shortfall. National debt credit will be further consolidated for a long time, and bondholders will also be able to enjoy fixed benefits for a long time. (6th Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Nanjing. Banking circles news. The government's decision to issue the Unified and Reconstruction Government Bonds, of which the Unified Government Bonds are to be used to redeem old bonds, and the Reconstruction Government Bonds are newly issued, is unprecedented in the history of domestic debt in terms of the amount of the debt. However, in the future bond market, there will be no drastic changes because the government has made careful considerations. The mission of the Bond Market Stabilization Fund Committee is to specifically manage the sale and purchase of government bonds. If the bond market is too high, the committee will sell bonds to suppress it. If the bond market is too low, the committee will purchase bonds to raise it. Furthermore, the current amount of banknotes issued in China has reached more than 800 million yuan. According to the method promised by Finance Minister Kong to the financial community in Shanghai a few days ago, 40% of the banknote issuance, the reserve portion, the bonds paid would be valued at 70%, which could accommodate 500 million yuan of government bonds. In the Issuance Reserve Management Committee, the total amount of the two government bonds issued is 180 million yuan, but only 130 million yuan are actually circulating in the market. The price of these 130 million yuan of government bonds circulating in the market will not differ greatly from the 70% price set by Finance Minister Kong. (6th Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Kong Sternly Instructs Subordinates to be Self-Disciplined Regarding Government Employees Purchasing Bonds</h3>
<p>Nanjing. The bond market experienced drastic changes a few days ago. It was rumored that some government employees were speculating in the market and that officials from the Ministry of Finance were involved. Finance Minister Kong paid close attention to this matter. Although personnel were dispatched to investigate, nothing was found. In order to strictly restrain his subordinates, he convened important members of the ministry on the 6th and gave instructions, stating that citizens have an obligation to purchase bonds issued by their government, just like the obligation to serve in the military and pay taxes. This is the case in all Eastern and Western countries. Government employees are citizens, so purchasing and earning interest on bonds issued by the government is a normal investment and their natural obligation. They can buy them, and they can sell them if they need cash. Because of his position, the minister is watched by the market, so since taking office as Minister of Finance, he has never made sweeping statements. However, because the ministry is the competent authority, the actions of colleagues are most easily exploited by speculators to create rumors, so they should be especially self-disciplined to avoid giving cause for criticism. A few days ago, rumors spread in the Shanghai bond market, causing bond prices to fall. In general, speculators suffered losses and attributed it to speculation and manipulation, vaguely implicating the ministry. This concerns the reputation of government employees and colleagues of the ministry, and whether it is true or false, it should be thoroughly investigated to clarify the truth. Appropriate personnel have been dispatched to cooperate with the supervisors of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and banking audit experts have also been transferred to conduct a strict investigation and report the facts. If it is confirmed that colleagues of the ministry are engaged in speculation and manipulation, they should be severely punished, because speculation and manipulation can disrupt the market, and it is not enough to stabilize the market and rectify official ethics without strict punishment. Although it has now been reported that there are no government employees or ministry personnel engaged in speculation or manipulation, in order to gain a thorough understanding, investigations should continue to be conducted in detail to bring the truth to light, so that it can be made clear in the future. Recently, some government employees have been unduly alarmed because they legitimately purchased bonds, which is unnecessary. However, colleagues in the ministry, because of their positions, should be even more cautious and self-disciplined in the future, even if it has been determined that there is no such fact, which is what I hope for.

<h3>Members of the Suiyuan-Mongolian Political Council Arrive in Suiyuan to Prepare for Establishment</h3>
<p>Tianjin. Guihua Telegraph. After the Central Government issued an order to form the Suiyuan-Mongolian Political Council, all the members and Wangs were very pleased. March 12 is the day of the grand sacrificial ceremony for the enshrinement of the spirit of Genghis Khan. The council plans to hold its founding meeting on that day. A Wang, Pan Wang, and all the Wangs and general managers have arrived in Guihua to discuss the preparations for the council with Suiyuan Chairman Fu Zuoyi. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing. It has recently been reported that someone is spreading rumors in the Peiping-Tianjin area in the name of representatives of the 29 Banners of Qinghai Mongols. As this is a sensitive time for the Mongolian border, and the matter is of great importance, reporters inquired with relevant parties. It has been learned that Lin Qinwangjile, the leader of the Right Wing League of Qinghai, and Sonam Dabu, the deputy leader of the Left Wing League, recently sent letters and telegrams to the capital, solemnly declaring that the Qinghai Mongols support the Central Government and obey the leader, as always. They also stated that in the future, any matters related to the Central Government concerning the two leagues and their 29 banners should be handled by Guan Baojia, the representative of the Left Wing League stationed in Beijing, and He Yongxin, the representative of the Right Wing League stationed in Beijing. Any person who spreads rumors in the name of a representative will not be recognized, which shows that those who are recently active in the Peiping-Tianjin area in the name of representatives of the 29 Banners of Qinghai Mongols are clearly impostors.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Stipulates Land and Rural Lending Measures</h3>
<p>Ordered the China Farmers Bank to Handle According to Regulations</p>
<p>Nanjing. In order to revitalize the rural economy and complete the legal currency policy, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated six measures for operating land mortgage loans and rural loans, and has ordered the China Farmers Bank to handle them accordingly. The main points of these measures are listed below:</p>
<p>* The China Farmers Bank should use at least 50 million yuan to operate land mortgage loans and rural loans.</p>
<p>* The aforementioned land mortgage loans and rural loans should be handled as much as possible in the areas where the bank's branches or offices are located. Where the bank has not yet established branches or offices in important agricultural areas or areas where rural finance urgently needs relief, it should be promoted.</p>
<p>* The China Farmers Bank's operation of land mortgage loans should be based on investing in rural land. Special projects for improving soil and managing farmland should be given low-interest financing.</p>
<p>* The China Farmers Bank's operation of rural loans should pay special attention to the relief of owner-farmers, organize sound cooperatives as soon as possible for investment, and provide low-interest financing.</p>
<p>* In order to handle rural loans, the China Farmers Bank should establish agricultural warehouses in convenient transportation locations to facilitate the transportation and sale of agricultural products. It should also promote the circulation of agricultural bills to finance farmers.</p>
<p>* The China Farmers Bank should submit a detailed report to the ministry at the end of each month on the types and amounts of land mortgage loans and rural loans it has handled, as well as the places where they have been invested. (6th Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>The Relationship Between Finance and Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>--- End</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the legal tender system just three months ago, foreign exchange controls have been successfully implemented, and the centralized issuance of banknotes has also been implemented. The implementation period for the new subsidiary currency is also not far off. The currency system reform has achieved such results in such a short period of time, which is truly gratifying. However, looking around the market, the old credit system has been completely destroyed, and all transactions require cash. Even the money shops, which are known as the headquarters for credit lending, have had to change their policies. Overdrafts are especially cautious, and ledger transactions must rely on reliable guarantees. Because the old lending methods cannot be liquidated, and new transactions are still stagnant, if this were not done, it would be impossible to reduce the risk of lending. However, the industry and commerce that receive loans are facing a general economic downturn. The manufactured goods are difficult to sell, and the lent money is difficult to recover. The profits earned over the past year are not enough to cover the interest on the loans. Their difficulties and hardships are even greater than those of the financial industry. The financial industry can use money not lent to industry and commerce for speculation in the market and arbitrage trading, but this is not the case for industry and commerce. In the situation of financial industry tightening lending, there is probably no other way than to offer higher interest rates to obtain turnover.</p>
<p>Recently, the government, in view of this, first issued unified government bonds to recover the securities that the financial industry regarded as investment objects for business purposes. On the one hand, this was done to balance the national treasury revenue and expenditure, and on the other hand, it was also enough to curb the financial industry's speculation. Speculation and arbitrage are not limited to securities. No one can speculate in cotton, flour, or wheat, but the comprehensive interest is not as generous and stable as securities. Therefore, in the past, securities could also be said to be the only speculative commodity of the financial industry. Since then, the financial industry has lost a way to speculate. If the funds are not lent to industry and commerce, they will also be used for real estate transactions. The reduction of deposit interest rates is an inevitable fact, and interest arrears will also be reduced accordingly. Industry and commerce will be able to alleviate their burdens somewhat.</p>
<p>However, there is still something I cannot help but say. The success of any reform requires the joint efforts of all levels. Although this is a cliché, it cannot be ignored. There are people who are jealous of the currency system reform. Suppose we do reduce interest rates, but people offer higher interest rates to attract deposits. Can funds avoid a second flight? This point should be guarded against in advance. This is the first point. Now, the trust savings deposits of various banks are mostly guaranteed by bonds, so the adjustment of bond prices will also affect the interests of depositors. This is the second point. How to settle the existing trading volume on the securities exchange, although it is a matter for one exchange, is also of great concern. This is the third point. I think the authorities can take the above three points into consideration early.</p>

<h3>Foreign Ministers of Japan, Army and Navy Confer on Diplomatic Policy Toward Russia</h3>
<p>Russia's Handling of Disputes as Local Issues; Further Negotiations to Establish Boundary Commission</p>
<p>Tokyo - Officials from the Foreign Ministry, Army, and Navy held another joint conference this afternoon to discuss the recent border clashes between Russia and Manchuria. Diplomatic observers believe the Japanese government intends to treat these incidents as local issues to prevent further escalation. However, it will urge the Soviet Union to respond to Japan's proposal to establish a joint boundary commission. The Japanese government will also remind Russia that the unclear borderlines are the root cause of frequent conflicts. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Regarding the incidents occurring in the border area between Soviet Russia and Manchuria, key officials gathered at the Foreign Ministry at 12:30 PM on the 6th to discuss policies towards the Soviet Union. Participants included Togo, Director of the Eurasian Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, Okamura, Chief of the Second Department of the General Staff of the Army, and Toyota, Director of the Naval Affairs Bureau of the Navy, as well as Takasu, Chief of the Third Department of the Naval General Staff. Other department heads from the three ministries also attended. The main items discussed were as follows:</p>
<p>The Jinchan Gou Incident of January 29th, i.e., the mutiny of the "Manchukuo" army.</p>
<p>The reply to the protest by Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Stomoniakov on January 30th.</p>
<p>Future diplomatic policies towards the Soviet Union, including the establishment of a border dispute resolution committee, etc.</p>
<p>After deliberating on the above issues, the Foreign Ministry officials believed that the actual situation of the conflicts in Manchuria was still under investigation and no confirmed reports had been received. Therefore, they brought various intelligence reports to the meeting to discuss fundamental countermeasures. It was decided that further deliberations would be necessary before issuing a formal reply to the Soviet government's protest. It is evident that the recent actions of the Soviet Union concerning the autonomous anti-communist measures in North China and the advances in Inner and Outer Mongolia, etc., may have been provocative, leading to a sudden and proactive attitude towards Japan and Manchuria. Therefore, Japan's diplomacy with the Soviet Union must be prepared with considerable resolve and handled with a friendly attitude. As for the resolution of these conflicts, the proposed policy is to treat them as local incidents. Since the occurrence of such frequent incidents is due to the unclear borderlines, the establishment of a boundary commission should be prioritized. The proposal to renegotiate, based on Foreign Minister Hirota's existing policy toward the Soviet Union, will be pursued. If the Soviet Union accepts this, the Soviet proposal to establish a dispute resolution committee can also be considered in order to fundamentally adjust the relations between Japan, Manchuria, and the Soviet Union and reach a peaceful conclusion. (Domei News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>Dalian - The Kwantung Army Headquarters issued a statement today, saying that it cannot agree with the Soviet Union's assertion that the existing borderlines between Manchuria and Russia should be recognized to avoid further conflicts. Recent conflicts have occurred because Russian authorities mistakenly believed that Japanese and Manchurian allied forces had invaded Russian territory. The Kwantung Army authorities believe that defining the border is a fundamental condition for peace, and the demarcation of the border must be based on history (in which case the borderlines will be pushed into current Russian territory). The Kwantung Army is eager to maintain amicable relations with Russia, and if the borders between Russia and Manchuria can be demarcated according to treaties, the current disputes can be peacefully resolved.

<h3>Army Staff Officer Ikeda Reports to Minister of the Army; Reports on Situation in North China; Okamura and Doihara to be Promoted to Lieutenant General</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Minister of the Army Kawashima received Lieutenant Colonel Ikeda, a staff officer of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin who had returned to Japan, at his official residence at 11:00 AM on the 6th. He listened to a one-hour report on the progress of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, the merger of the Hebei-East Chahar Autonomous Anti-Communist Council regime, negotiations on the anti-communist agreement, the expansion and strengthening of the Tianjin garrison, and the intentions of the garrison. From 2:00 PM, he also received Colonel Sakai, former Chief of Staff of the Tianjin garrison, to hear his explanations about the actual situation in North China for over an hour. (Domei, 6th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Staff Officer Ikeda visited Minister of the Army Kawashima this morning to explain concrete measures for increasing troops in the China Garrison. Therefore, the issue of expanding the China Garrison will be realized due to Staff Officer Ikeda's visit to Tokyo. (Dentsu, 6th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The General Staff Headquarters held a meeting at 1:00 PM today in the Second Department, led by Okamura, Chief of the Second Department, Kita, Chief of the China Section, and Major General Isotani, military attaché of the Japanese Embassy in China who is currently in Tokyo, to exchange views on policies towards China. The conclusions will be presented at the meeting between the East Asia Bureau of the Foreign Ministry and the Second Department of the General Staff Headquarters to be held on the 7th. (Dentsu, 6th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Army will conduct regular personnel changes next month and has begun concrete investigations. Promotions will be considered within the following scope:</p>
<p>Those to be promoted to Lieutenant General include Major General Okamura Yasuji, Chief of the Second Department of the General Staff Headquarters, and Major General Doihara Kenji, attached to the Kwantung Army Headquarters. Those to be promoted to Major General include Colonel Kita Makoto, Chief of the China Section of the General Staff Headquarters. Others are omitted. Except for Major General Doihara, who will be the highest advisor to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council after his promotion, the others will remain in their current positions. The promotion of the oldest Major Generals of the division commander class was completed during the regular personnel changes in December last year. Therefore, this change will inevitably involve the retirement of two or three senior military councilors. It remains to be seen whether Minister of the Army Kawashima can truly implement this.

<h3>Outside Dagu Port, Ice Mountains Block the Waterway</h3>
<p>Ships Trapped, Supplies Cut Off; Peddlers Carry Food on Ice to Sell</p>
<p>Tianjin - Outside Dagu Port, the ice is solid and, agitated by the tide, rises high like mountains, stretching endlessly. Regular ships between Dalian and Tianjin, as well as Yingkou and Miyapu, are surrounded by icebergs. On the afternoon of the 5th, they risked sailing into Tanggu, sustaining multiple damages to their hulls. Navigation to and from the port remains blocked. The ice mountains between Tanggu and Dagu are piled up to over ten feet high, making it impossible to break through. Because of the accumulation of icebergs outside Dagu Port, the waterway is blocked, and imported goods have not arrived for nearly two weeks. The price of imported goods needed in Tianjin has skyrocketed. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Tianjin - The Port Director of Tianjin Customs issued a notice on the 6th, stating that the ice in Bohai Bay has recently become very thick, and all ships traveling to and from should avoid danger, as the port will not be responsible. As of the evening of the 6th, a total of seventeen large ships were trapped in the ice outside Dagu Port, all visible outside Heigu. The number of ships that are out of sight due to the distance and weather is unknown. Chinese and foreign shipping companies in Tianjin held a meeting at the Dalian Steamship Company on the 6th to discuss rescue methods, but no solution was found. Peddlers outside Dagu Port risked traveling on the ice to sell food to the frozen ships. A pound of wheat bread was priced at six or seven yuan. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Tianjin - The ships trapped in the ice in Zhili Bay have had their supplies cut off, making assistance difficult. Shipping merchants are very concerned. Many passengers are on board the trapped ships. A plan to use Chinese ice sleds to transport food ultimately failed because the ice surface was uneven and had breaks, and the goods being carried were also heavy. The Huogu Tugboat Company had no choice but to hire many laborers to carry coal on the ice to reach the trapped ships, but each person could only carry forty pounds of coal. Shipping representatives held a meeting here yesterday and repeatedly appealed to Dalian to send a powerful icebreaker for assistance, but this is likely to be ineffective because Dalian's icebreakers are currently busy at their own port and Huludao. However, it is reported that a certain icebreaking vessel has now arrived at Shaludian (transliteration), where three Chinese and Japanese merchant ships are in a dangerous situation. The Shengjing steamer, which left Shanghai yesterday, may load coal in Qingdao to supply the Taikoo ships, which are currently trapped at Dagu. The Wuzhou steamer is short of food, while the Hubei and Nanzhuan steamers, although not lacking in food, are running out of coal. The Wuzhou steamer sent a radio message today stating that despite repeated attempts, they have been unsuccessful, and starting the engine is just wasting coal. They only light the fire for four hours each day, waiting for the weather to improve. A Jardine Matheson ship reached ten miles from Dagu but turned back to Yantai. The Tianjin Navigation Company's Xikang steamer is currently leaking and lacks food and coal. The weather has not improved today, and the ice blocks remain very thick. It snowed non-stop in Tianjin last night. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Tianjin - Since the sudden cold snap in late January, the sea surface within sixty miles outside Tanggu has frozen to a thickness of over ten feet, resulting in the greatest freeze in two hundred years. As a result, Tianjin has been completely blocked by solid ice. The Osaka Shosen Kaisha's Changan Maru, which set sail on the morning of the 1st, was the last merchant ship to leave Tianjin. Currently, all inbound and outbound ships are blocked, resulting in chaos. There are currently twelve merchant ships and two ferries anchored outside the port, but all are trapped by solid ice and cannot move. All shipping companies are helpless, and icebreakers are also experiencing difficulties. Therefore, those involved in shipping, such as shipping companies, transportation businesses, and dockworkers, can only wait helplessly for the thaw. The Osaka Shosen Kaisha's Changjiang Maru, which was originally scheduled to enter the port on the night of the 3rd, has now decided to divert to Qinhuangdao to allow passengers to disembark. Due to the freezing of Tanggu, the import and export of important commodities in Tianjin have been suspended, disrupting commercial activity. There is also a shortage of food, threatening the people. This is the greatest freeze Tianjin has ever experienced since its opening. (Dentsu, 6th)</p>
<h3>Various Locations: Snowstorms Disrupt Traffic</h3>
<p>Beiping - Due to heavy snow last night, the long-distance telephone lines between Beiping and Tianjin were broken and out of service from 7:00 AM this morning.

<h3>Revision of the Ministry of Finance's Organization Law: Preliminary Review Completed by the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>Nanjing - Regarding the revision of the organization laws of the Customs, Salt Tax, and Internal Revenue Administrations under the Ministry of Finance, and the establishment of an auditing department, the Finance and Legal System Committees of the Legislative Yuan appointed Wei Tingsheng and Shi Weihuan, among others, to conduct a preliminary review. The review has now been completed. On the morning of the 6th, they invited Jiang Guanghui and Yang Bingquan, representatives of the Ministry of Finance, to the Yuan for joint research. As a result, several principles for revising the Ministry of Finance's organization law were drafted and submitted to the Finance and Legal System Committees, which will forward them to Sun Ke for approval. (Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>Nanjing - The Financial Committee of the Legislative Yuan, convened by Wei Ting Sheng on the 6th for preliminary review of the Ministry of Finance's Organization Law, with Ministry of Finance Advisor Cai Guanghui in attendance to provide explanations. The review concluded with a decision in principle: the Accounting Department will be reorganized into an Accounting Office, headed by a chief accountant. A separate Auditing Department will be established. The organization of the Customs and Tax Administrations will remain unchanged. Due to the upcoming implementation of the new salt law, the Salt Administration is planned to be reorganized into the Salt Affairs Department. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>League of Nations Studies Oil Embargo: Subcommittee Completes Report</h3>
<p>Success of Oil Embargo Against Italy Hinges on U.S. Attitude</p>
<p>Geneva - The League of Nations subcommittee studying oil substitutes completed its draft report today, which will be discussed by the full committee studying the oil embargo against Italy tomorrow. The report details all substitutes and the extent to which Italy can obtain them. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Geneva - The committee of experts from eighteen nations, discussing the embargo on kerosene, discussed the issue of importing kerosene from the United States, Russia, and Romania into Italy this afternoon. Detailed information was collected for study. The expert committee has almost completed its study on the question of what substitutes Italy could use once the embargo is implemented. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Geneva - Economic experts investigating the potential success of an oil embargo against Italy today estimated Italy's existing oil reserves at 500,000 to 700,000 tons, sufficient for only six months of use. Even if Italy could purchase oil abroad, the number of oil tankers available could not meet the total demand. Therefore, experts believe that the success of the oil embargo depends entirely on the United States, as the United States controls half of the world's kerosene production and has a quarter of the world's oil tankers. (National News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>New York - The Oil and Gas Journal reported today that the amount of kerosene extracted in the United States in the week before February 1 was slightly less than in the previous week. The average daily extraction rate was 2,815,550 barrels, compared to 2,820,500 barrels in the previous week. The average daily extraction rate in the week before January 18 was 2,833,600 barrels.

<h3>Italy Decides on Policy to Address the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Military Operations in Ethiopia Continue</p>
<p>Rome - Prime Minister Mussolini silently awaits the League of Nations' decision to implement an oil embargo against Italy today. After the Fascist Grand Council held a secret meeting, Mussolini's response plan has been fully determined. However, the exact details of this policy remain unclear until the League of Nations announces it. The Grand Council has decided to continue military operations in Ethiopia regardless of diplomatic developments in Geneva or elsewhere. It has also ordered that all foreign trade be directly controlled by the government in the future. The Ministry of War has issued a statement announcing that General Graziani's troops in Somalia have advanced again on the southern front, achieving two consecutive victories and currently moving north along the Ethi-Somali border. (National News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Rome - Prime Minister Mussolini convened a military conference with the commanders of various army corps at noon in the Palazzo Venezia, which lasted for a long time. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>US-UK Talks on Reviving International Trade</h3>
<p>British House Debates Redistributing World Resources; Motion to Convene International Conference Defeated</p>
<p>Washington - British and American diplomats are currently discussing methods to promote the revival of international trade. Secretary of State Hull told reporters today that British Ambassador to the United States Sir Ronald Lindsay has held multiple meetings with the State Department. Although the two countries do not yet have specific proposals, he hopes that tangible progress can be made. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>London - Former Labour Party leader Lansbury proposed a motion stating that he firmly believes in the futility of war and that the British government should immediately work to convene an international conference under the auspices of the League of Nations to address the economic problems that are causing countries around the world to prepare for war. This motion was debated intensely in the House of Commons yesterday and was defeated by a vote of 228 to 137. However, the House of Commons passed an amendment proposed by Conservative MP Evans by a vote of 207 to 125, endorsing the first paragraph of Lansbury's motion and expressing confidence that the government would make sincere efforts to increase international prosperity and goodwill. Former Prime Minister Lloyd George spoke, urging the government to accept Lansbury's motion, stating the increasingly tense situation due to countries' preparations for war and saying that peace cannot be achieved until the distribution of League of Nations mandates is reconsidered.</p>
<h3>Lansbury Motion, Lloyd George Support, Conservative Amendment Passed</h3>
<p>Lansbury, in his motion, stated that economic issues such as access to raw materials and markets and the need for immigration are the reasons for the current global arms race. He does not believe that any system relying solely on force can maintain fairness to the enemy once war breaks out, as the belligerent nations have lost their sense of right and wrong. Solutions achieved through force will inevitably be reconsidered and revised sooner or later. We should examine the world's economic situation. He does not advocate dividing the British Empire among others but seeks a completely new concept of world unity, under which global resources can be managed by an international authority serving all countries. If governments can cooperate, this humane proposal would be easier to implement.</p>
<p>Evans then proposed an amendment, and Lloyd George followed up, supporting Lansbury, saying that countries are now actively preparing for war, reasoning that because other countries are extensively arming themselves, we should follow suit. The economic aspects of this issue deserve attention. He represented the British Empire in concluding the Treaty of Versailles, and therefore he feels obliged to speak. He does not believe that peace can be achieved until League of Nations mandates are reconsidered. We should inform other countries of Britain's readiness to reconsider the mandates. The hopes arising from the Locarno Treaties and the Paris Peace Pact have been completely lost in recent years. Global armaments have greatly increased, and the tense, fearful, and dangerous situation is becoming increasingly apparent. The two great powers of Europe, Russia and Germany, fear encirclement. Germany fears Russia and France, while Russia fears Germany and Japan. Can't this fear be eliminated early to avoid regrets? Economic considerations are extremely important. Japan's actions in the Far East and Italy's war in Ethiopia are examples. He does not advocate ceding a piece of the Empire, but the League of Nations mandates should be reconsidered in a comprehensive review of colonial issues. Germany's demands should not be disregarded because of the foolish words of some German leaders. He asks the government to consider whether now is the right time to convene a meeting of nations to ask what they want.</p>
<p>Liberal Party member Burnett stated that Lansbury's method of seeking peace is to give up everything. Lansbury strongly objected to this, so Burnett asked Lansbury to explain what he was unwilling to give up. Lansbury replied that there is nothing worth sacrificing human life for, and there are many other ways to struggle besides killing. Conservative Party member Emery stated that such a meeting would inevitably fail. How can convening a meeting and asking countries to be prepared to give up their territory or change their economic policies be helpful? Undersecretary of State Cranborne spoke on behalf of the government in response to Lansbury's proposal, saying that the government does not disagree with Lansbury's words, but the difference of opinion lies in the degree of faith only. Everyone is anxious about the state of global armaments. If Britain does reconsider the current state of its own military preparations, it will do so not to start a war but to strengthen its ability to maintain order and resist forces that disrupt order. If the situation changes and there is an opportunity for general disarmament, the government will seize it with both hands. Former Foreign Secretary Hoare made a statement on the raw materials issue in Geneva, and the government still believes that international discussion of this issue has great value. But who can say that the time is ripe for discussing such complex issues? We must avoid repeating the disastrous failure of the 1933 International Monetary and Economic Conference. The government does not want to avoid anything. Preliminary research on this issue has already begun, but in the current environment, it has not been possible to decide on the date for continuing negotiations.</p>
<p>After the debate, Lansbury's motion was defeated, and the Conservative amendment was passed. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Japan Eager to Participate in Redistribution of World Resources, In Line with Hirota's Ideas</h3>
<p>On the 5th, the British House of Commons proposed convening a world conference on resource redistribution, believing that it is necessary to maintain world peace and implement fair distribution of resources and territory. This proposal was advocated by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. Foreign Minister Hirota has also strongly advocated for the free acquisition of resources and markets in his diplomatic speeches in the Diet. Therefore, Japan will take the lead in participating when the United Kingdom considers holding an international conference on resource allocation, and will openly express its participation policy. (Dentsu, 6th)</p>
<p>London - Lieutenant Commander Ishimatsu of the Japanese Navy has recently published a book here entitled "Japan Should Fight Britain," which states, "Unless Japan ceases its outward expansion policy, Britain should abandon a portion of its ownership or its hoped-for ownership. Even if the current trade treaties between Britain and Japan are revised, it may be enough to solve economic difficulties temporarily, but it will only postpone the date of the crisis and the conflict between the two countries will ultimately be unavoidable. This is because Japan's population is rapidly increasing while its resources are scarce, leading to economic hardship. The ultimate solution lies only in the use of force. The reason why Japan will eventually fight Britain is precisely this. Britain's vast territory and abundant resources mean that even if it gives up some parts, it will be self-sufficient. Conversely, Japan's territory and resources are both insufficient, so what it is fighting for is a matter of national survival. For Britain to plan for the best, it must restrain its pride and willingly concede, which is enough to protect itself." The author also speculates that Japan may be able to cope with a united front of the United Kingdom and the United States, saying, "Since the European War, Britain has been unhesitatingly close to the United States, even to the point of humbling itself to please the United States. The fact that Britain and the United States are competing for the world is certainly true, but if a third party rises on the international stage, they will abandon their grievances and repair old friendships to cope with the situation."

<h3>British Military Aircraft Squadron to Make a Periodic Goodwill Flight to Japan</h3>
<p>Departing from Singapore on the 10th; Expected to Arrive in Kasumigaura on the 25th</p>
<p>Tokyo: The British Royal Air Force from Singapore, intending to conduct a goodwill flight to Japan, is scheduled to depart from Singapore on the 10th of this month, passing through Manila, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Kagoshima. It is expected to arrive in Kasumigaura on the 25th. This marks the first time that a large British military aircraft squadron will fly to Japan, making it a landmark event in aviation history that has attracted significant attention. The aviation personnel will include 21 individuals in addition to the commander-in-chief, Mr. Sidney Smith. The flight route from Shanghai to Kagoshima and Kasumigaura has been discussed and agreed upon with the Japanese Navy. The confirmed arrangements are as follows:</p>
<p>On the 23rd of this month, the squadron will depart from Shanghai and follow a direct route between Shanghai and Kagoshima, landing in Kagoshima Bay. Departing from the south of Oshima, Kagoshima, it will fly towards a point ten nautical miles south of the Nojima Lighthouse. It will then head north along the outer side of the Boso Peninsula, entering the mainland from Kujukuri Beach, and land in Kasumigaura on the same day. On March 1st, it will depart from Kasumigaura and return along the same route, arriving back in Singapore on March 10th. This is the current tentative plan. (DOMEI News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia and Romania to Conclude Military Accord; Russian Deputy Defense Minister Returns Home from England</h3>
<p>London: According to information obtained by this newspaper's correspondent from sources within the Little Entente countries, a military accord between the Soviet Union and Romania is expected to be signed soon. The details of the accord remain strictly confidential. However, it is recalled that following the establishment of the Franco-Soviet and Czechoslovak-Soviet mutual assistance pacts last year, the Soviet Union and Romania held talks to discuss issues such as: If Czechoslovakia were to be invaded by Germany, the Soviet Union, in accordance with the Czechoslovak-Soviet mutual assistance pact, would be obliged to send troops to assist, and Romania would be required to permit the passage of Soviet land and air forces to aid Czechoslovakia. It is believed that the military accord now being concluded is a continuation of these discussions. (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>London: According to information obtained by the diplomatic correspondent of the "Morning Post" in London, a treaty between Russia and Romania will soon be announced. This treaty is the result of talks between the diplomatic authorities of Russia and Romania in Paris, stipulating mutual assistance within the framework of the League of Nations, with its main points similar to the Franco-Russian treaty. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Paris: The French Parliament has not yet ratified the Franco-Russian mutual assistance pact. The Chamber of Deputies is about to introduce it for discussion. The Standing Committee of the Orthodox Socialist Party held a meeting to discuss the attitude the party should adopt towards this matter. Several deputies from the party suggested approving the pact with certain reservations. In other words, they demanded that the government provide firm promises not to attach secret military clauses to the pact, which would oblige France to provide automatic assistance to Soviet Russia. However, the Standing Committee decided as a result of the discussion that all deputies of the party should approve the pact without reservation. (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Paris: The Executive Committee of the French Socialist Party met here today and resolved to propose to Parliament to approve the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Accord. However, there were many dissenting voices regarding this resolution, pointing out the dangers of this agreement to France. They therefore demanded that the Socialist Party obtain guarantees from the government that there would be no secret or public military clauses that would obligate France to assist Russia in wartime before they could agree. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>London: Soviet Deputy Commissar of Defense General Tukhachevsky accompanied the Foreign Commissar Litvinov to England to attend the funeral of the late King. After Litvinov crossed the sea to France, General Tukhachevsky remained in this country, visiting various arms factories, military schools, and all institutions related to naval and military affairs almost without interruption. It is now scheduled that he will leave here and return to the country this Sunday. It is generally believed that General Tukhachevsky's visit was to prepare for the ordering of military supplies from British manufacturers. However, this order has not yet been finalized.

<h3>British Air Route to Extend to Hong Kong Next Month</h3>
<p>London: The regular airline service of Imperial Airways is scheduled to extend to Singapore and Hong Kong in March. According to the results of test flights, the climate along this route is very suitable. Negotiations are currently underway regarding passage through Vietnam. However, the Chinese government still prohibits foreign aircraft from transiting, which is a difficulty. It is reported that the American airline can only fly to Macau and is not allowed to go further inland. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia to Borrow Funds from England; Totaling £40 Million; Negotiations in Progress</h3>
<p>London: Rumors of Soviet Russia intending to borrow funds from England have been circulating for some time. According to information obtained by this newspaper from sources related to the two countries, negotiations regarding this matter are currently in progress. The Cabinet has repeatedly studied the issue and has sent personnel to Moscow to work with the Soviet authorities to finalize the details of the loan and the collateral that the Soviet Union can provide. The value of the collateral currently proposed by the Soviet Union is only 75% of the total loan amount. Some British cabinet members are advocating for full collateral. The total loan amount is reportedly £40 million, with an annual interest rate of 6.5% to 7%. The British government would also issue an equal amount of public bonds domestically with an annual interest rate of 2.5% to 3% to finance this loan. The difference in interest rates (approximately 4%), along with approximately £15 million of funds deposited in British banks during the Tsarist era that have not been used since the revolution, would be used to settle Tsarist-era debts owed to Britain. It is reported that the Cabinet is highly supportive of lending funds to the Soviet Union to enable it to rapidly rearm and improve its railway materials. (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>
<h3>Estonian Airspace Violated by Soviet Russian Aircraft; Estonia Lodges Protest</h3>
<p>The capital of Estonia: Three Soviet Russian military aircraft flew over the national border yesterday and circled over the city of Narva for half an hour. A border guard immediately opened fire, and the aircraft flew towards the Soviet Russian border. After receiving the report, the authorities here instructed the ambassador to Russia to lodge a protest with the Soviet Russian government. (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>England to Issue White Paper Announcing National Defense Plan; Naval Section Most Important</h3>
<p>London: The Cabinet discussed the issue of national defense expenditure this morning and decided to issue a white paper explaining the rearmament plan. This white paper will be published at the end of this month. While the official content of the plan remains strictly confidential, it is generally known that the plan for the Air Force proposed in 1934 (stipulating that the number of Air Force aircraft should be doubled within five years) will not undergo any substantial modifications at this time. However, construction work will be accelerated. For example, each aircraft factory must produce a complete set of all components in addition to each aircraft, so that a second aircraft of the same type can be built in a short period of time simply by installing the fuselage. Regarding the Army, the number of reservists and supplementary reservists will gradually be increased. The work of mechanizing and motorizing the active army is already underway, and funds will be raised to continue this work. The most important part of the plan is the Navy. It is not yet known whether the Navy will build battleships this year, but there is no doubt that the construction of one or two aircraft carriers is currently under consideration. In addition, the Navy believes that cruisers are essential for imperial defense and will expedite their construction to increase the number from the current 50 to 70, and will also build a number of torpedo boats. (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>London: It is reported that the British government's national defense plan has been drafted and will be considered at the next cabinet meeting. It seems likely that the proposal to raise funds to reorganize the army, navy, and air force will be shelved due to opposition from the Ministry of Finance. The general idea is that during the implementation of the national defense plan, short-term bonds will be used in the form of treasury bills to raise the necessary funds. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>London: The British government has decided to issue £200 million in national defense bonds to expand the army, navy, and air force. At the same time, a new organization for the command of the national forces will be established and its policies defined. The details will be announced soon. It is reported that the general outline of the new national defense program is as follows: Issue £200 million in national defense bonds to expand the army, navy, and air force. To gain air superiority, the air force will be greatly expanded. New cruisers will be built to strengthen Britain's defense lines. A new national defense control agency will be established, incorporating representatives from the army, navy, and air force. The head of the new agency will be a civilian official.

<h3>Romanian King Reaffirms Pro-French Policy; Will Not Change in the Future</h3>
<p>Paris: Romanian King Carol recently made a statement to the press, saying: "Romania's foreign policy has not changed and will not change in the future. I and Foreign Minister Titulescu are working together with one heart and mind, basing our actions on international treaties and the League of Nations Covenant, and seeking to build and maintain a peaceful system through collective security. Romania is ready to participate in any organization concerning Central Europe, whether economic or for security guarantees." (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Paris: Romanian King Carol today gave his first interview to a reporter from the Associated Press, saying that the accession of King Edward VIII to the throne of England has made the movement for peace in Europe brighter. The Romanian King highly praised the British King, saying that the British King has traveled all over the world and has gained broad experience and insight, possessing keen observation and strong character, and has contact with people of all levels, and is able to cope with various environments, and is bound to govern the Empire with ease. I firmly believe that the British King's experience will benefit all countries and peoples of the world. The Romanian King further stated that the Balkan Peninsula was once a powder keg of Europe, but now the relations between the countries are harmonious and the feelings are increasing. I am making this statement to prove that Romania and France have reaffirmed their friendly relations. The friendship between France and Romania is a powerful factor in promoting peace and general security in Europe. Bulgarian King Boris, Yugoslav Regent Prince Paul, and I took advantage of the opportunity to attend the funeral of the late King George V of England to conduct long-standing private talks, which convinced me that the improvement of relations between the Balkan countries is satisfactory.

<h3>Austrian Vice-Chancellor Announces; Still Holding Restoration Stance</h3>
<p>Paris: Austrian Vice-Chancellor Prince Starhemberg recently made a statement to the Paris correspondent of the Austrian "Official News Agency," saying: "I have made repeated talks with French diplomatic authorities in the French capital, making the will of our country undoubtedly exposed. As for Austria's all domestic issues, such as the restoration issues of the old Habsburg Royal Family, our country should retain freedom of action and decision-making, without any interference. The Austrian authorities fully understand their responsibilities, and do not want to do anything that would endanger European security. I have repeatedly reiterated to French politicians that Austria cannot agree to abandon the restoration stance, but our country does not want to take any definite steps without prior consultation with other countries. Regarding the issue of Austria conducting negotiations with the Little Entente countries, I have clearly stated that such exchanges of views, if they are to be truly beneficial, must have Italy's participation. Italy is a powerful guarantor of Austria's territorial integrity." (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>
<h3>Naval Conference Experts; Researching Definition of Warships; England Inquires Italian Representatives Attitudes</h3>
<p>London: The expert subcommittee appointed by the General Committee of the Naval Conference continued to discuss the definitions of various warships today. The work is based on the principles decided on the first of this week, that the distinction between battleships and cruisers should be based on the armament installed on each ship, as stipulated in the Washington Naval Treaty. The definition of aircraft carriers should also be based on the Washington Naval Treaty, that is, any warship, regardless of the number of aircraft it carries, should not be considered an aircraft carrier if it does not have the characteristics of an aircraft carrier, such as a deck for aircraft to take off and land. At this time, there are two issues that have not yet been resolved, one is the displacement of battleships, and the other is whether small warships, such as shallow-water coastal defense ships, should be subject to quantitative restrictions. (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>London: Mr. Craigie, an expert on naval issues from the Foreign Office, inquired about the attitude of the Italian delegation on the issue of battleship tonnage. The Italian representatives visited the Foreign Office this afternoon to explain Italy's position to the British representatives. Italy's position is the same as that of France, agreeing to limit the tonnage of battleships to 27,000 tons or 28,000 tons. According to information obtained by this newspaper's correspondent, the British side has now realized that Italy's attitude is not as rigid as France's and is more likely to compromise. Therefore, the current difficulty lies in how to reconcile the views of the United States and France. Regarding this, some people advocate the following compromise: that the United States and European countries are not in a confrontational state, so the tonnage of American battleships may be higher than that of European naval powers. The British side believes that this statement is ridiculous and there is no possibility of it being implemented, because Britain absolutely cannot accept this method, and Japan also obviously cannot agree. Others advocate setting the tonnage of battleships at around 30,000 tons, but this is also not acceptable to the United States. (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>
<h3>George Bernard Shaw; Ridicules America for Abandoning Constitution</h3>
<p>Miami: The famous playwright George Bernard Shaw said today, when criticizing the Supreme Court for overturning government legislation, that America has abandoned the Constitution because Roosevelt really wants to do something for the country, but the imperfect Constitution prevents a talented and dedicated president from demonstrating his talents. Every time the president does something, the Supreme Court pulls his leg. Is such a constitution still worth respecting? (Guomin News Agency, 5th)</p>

<h3>United States Planning; South Pacific Aviation</h3>
<p>"China Clipper" First Flight to Far East; Revenue Exceeds Expenditure Threefold</p>
<p>Washington: Postmaster General Brown stated to the House Appropriations Committee today that if the Pacific Air Mail, which has already been launched, is completely successful, then a postal route between Hawaii and Australia will be planned. However, he does not expect that the line can be successful this year. Brown said that the current results of the Pacific flight are very good, and it is likely that passenger service will begin this spring. At that time, someone asked about the revenue and expenditure results of the "China Clipper's" first flight to the Far East. Brown replied that the flight carried 1,800 pounds of mail, mostly philatelic in nature, totaling 113,000 pieces, and the postage received was $85,000. Therefore, the revenue has exceeded the expenditure threefold. (Guomin News Agency, 5th)</p>
<h3>Seventh; Pan-Pacific Conference</h3>
<p>Held in California, USA in Mid-August; Far East Economy as Main Agenda</p>
<p>Tokyo: The countries with interests in the Pacific, including China, Japan, England, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and the Soviet Union, have held six Pan-Pacific Conferences. They were postponed for the past two years, but in view of the various economic problems that have repeatedly occurred in the Pacific coastal countries, it was decided to convene the Seventh Pan-Pacific Conference. The convener is the United States, and a specific plan is currently being made. It has been decided that the meeting will be held in California starting on August 15th of this year, with a duration of two weeks. Notices have been sent to the relevant countries, and Japan has been urged to participate. The organization in Japan that deals with this issue was originally the Pacific Affairs Research Association, but it was merged into the Japan International Association last December. The President of the Association, Kikujiro Ishii (Viscount), has submitted the matter of participation to the Preparatory Committee, and activities have begun regarding the selection of representatives. It is reported that the theme of the conference is "The Objectives and Results of Economic Policies of Pacific Countries," including the Soviet Union's economic policy, the United States' recovery policy, and other major issues of various countries. The Far East issue will be the main focus, with Japan's economic trends as the focus of discussion. Japan plans to send twenty people to attend this conference. (DOMEI News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>US Inflation Theory</h3>
<p>Current Trend Seems Unlikely to Materialize; But Credit Expansion is Still Possible</p>
<p>New York: The theory of inflation has gradually subsided in financial circles here, but it is believed that credit expansion is still possible. The recent inflation theory has indeed prompted some people to compete to purchase securities to avoid suffering losses. The government's austerity plan has now stabilized the yuan price. What is still worth paying attention to today is that foreign securities merchants, who are more sensitive to inflation than Americans, are no longer continuing to purchase. Today, the sales and purchases from London are roughly balanced. (Guomin News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>New York: New York financial circles and well-informed observers unanimously express doubts about the imminent realization of inflation, believing that the current trend will be a moderate management of inflation to seek a return to sound prosperity. From an economic and monetary point of view, current facts seem to favor the path of managed inflation. Banks here are currently negotiating to continue shipping $8,480,000 in gold exports, but this should not be regarded as a harbinger of inflation. Gold exports have reached $14,523,000 in the past two days, enough to prevent the sharp depreciation of the US dollar. What is worth paying attention to now is that the trend of US government bonds is firm, which is a major anti-inflation symbol. (Guomin News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington: It was learned today that President Roosevelt's action to cancel the government's $10 billion loan commitment yesterday was intended to increase the strength of government bonds and to eliminate rumors of inflation. At the same time, the leaders of the government in the House of Representatives have publicly stated that if they want to find a way to pass a new tax to pay for the veteran's pensions during the current session of Congress, then the actions of the inflationists may become impossible to control. (Guomin News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington: The government has today begun investigating the country's financial and political needs, preparing to submit a new tax plan to Congress to pay for the recently passed veterans' pensions and agricultural relief funds. House government leaders Dalton and Vincent visited the White House today, requesting a temporary postponement, while inflationist leader Patman will hold a meeting with congressmen who support inflation to plan the inflation movement. (Guomin News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Babson, a famous statistician in Wellesley, Massachusetts, believes that inflation in the United States is inevitable. Babson issued a warning today, saying that the nation's securities market will have a significant reaction to this future trend. The payment of military benefits is only one symptom, and we "should prepare to deal with continued depredation." According to Babson's prediction, the payment of benefits will raise the prices of automobile and parts stocks. (Guomin News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington: Inflationist congressmen warned congressional leaders that they planned to begin a movement last week to pay veterans' pensions in paper money. The American labor community, hearing this, has now risen to support President Roosevelt. Green, president of the General Federation of Labor, issued a declaration stating that inflation has serious effects on the economic and social welfare of the people. If prices rise as a result, the limited purchasing power of the people will be completely destroyed. Therefore, a sound public policy should first raise wages and then raise prices. (Guomin News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington: Inflationist congressmen in the House of Representatives have today begun to revive the Patman inflationary pension bill. The bill was previously shelved due to the Harrison pension bill. Now that the Harrison bill has been passed, the Patman faction has decided to ask the Rules Committee to find a way to have the bill voted on in the House of Representatives. If the committee refuses, they plan to sign a petition to force the House of Representatives to vote on the bill. (Guomin News Agency, 5th)</p>
<h3>Repeal of Cotton Production Control Law; House of Representatives Also Passes</h3>
<p>Washington: The House of Representatives today passed proposals to repeal the Bankhead Cotton Act, the Colth Smith Tobacco Act, and the 1935 Sweet Potato Act. This move was made at the request of President Roosevelt. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington: The House Agriculture Committee has passed the repeal of the Bankhead Cotton Production Control Law, the Colth Smith Tobacco Control Law, and the Sweet Potato Control Law, but with an amendment to exempt all past evaluations of cotton production that have not been taxed. The bill has now been returned to the Senate to seek agreement on the amendments. (Guomin News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington: The Senate Agriculture Committee today redrafted the government's agricultural bill, preparing to submit it to the Senate for discussion tomorrow. Senator Smith declared that the bill is still based on the soil conservation plan, and stipulates cooperation between the states and the federal government, with the Secretary of Agriculture as the liaison officer.

<h3>British Member of the Upper House Questions; Shanghai British Police Abuse of Force; Withdrawn After Government's Reply</h3>
<p>London: Lord Marley, leader of the opposition party in the Upper House, inquired in the Upper House today about the incident in December last year in which the British police in the Shanghai International Settlement abused force against unarmed protesting students. However, after the government's reply, the formal motion in the Upper House regarding this matter was withdrawn. When inquiring about this matter, Marley stated that the peaceful actions of the protesting students in Shanghai were violently suppressed. External Decision Officer Stanhope replied that the scenes of student demonstrations in Shanghai published in the Shanghai newspapers he had seen were substantially different from what Lord Marley said. Judging from the Shanghai newspapers, the students obstructed traffic and attempted to enter the settlement. As for the allegation that the police under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Council used inappropriate force, he will investigate it. However, he believes that the most undesirable thing for the Council's police is to inappropriately beat Chinese people and cause Chinese-foreign resentment. This kind of action is clearly in conflict with the interests of the Municipal Council's board of directors and the people of Shanghai. Therefore, he cannot help but doubt the accuracy of the information obtained by Lord Marley. But he undertakes that Foreign Secretary Eden will conduct an investigation in Shanghai.

<h3>Polish Corridor; German Train Passage Issue</h3>
<p>Berlin: The Polish government yesterday decided to restrict German train transportation starting on the 7th of this month in order to partially remedy the shortage of domestic railway income, due to the fact that German railway trains passing through the corridor have outstanding debts that have not been paid, causing disputes with Germany that have not been resolved so far. Political figures here have severely criticized this, believing that if this restriction method is implemented, it will greatly inconvenience merchants traveling between Germany and East Prussia. Although the German authorities can expedite the opening of maritime and aviation services as a remedial measure, general public opinion here is still urging the government to seek the basis for a final solution to the issue of German trains passing through the Polish Corridor, based on the spirit of the German-Polish Friendship Treaty signed on February 25, 1934.

<h3>Nagata Assassination Case: Japanese Military Court Continues Trial; Aizawa Answers Motives for the Crime</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The fifth public trial of the Nagata incident by the military court continued this morning at 10:00 AM inside the headquarters of the First Division. The trial proceeded to the core of the incident. Prosecutor Shimada questioned Lieutenant Colonel Aizawa regarding his thoughts on the Showa Restoration and his motives for the crime. Lieutenant Colonel Aizawa replied that the Showa Restoration lay in removing the private ownership of power and wealth by the people. However, Minister Nagata was obstructing the Showa Restoration. He believed that "cutting him down with one stroke" could create the impetus for the Showa Restoration. He further stated that the replacement of Minister Masaki, who wanted to thoroughly clarify the national essence, was evidence of Nagata's machinations. (6th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The fifth public trial by the military court of Lieutenant Colonel Saburo Aizawa, who is being tried for the Nagata incident, opened this morning at 10:00 AM. Presiding Judge Sato asked the prosecutor if there were any further questions. Prosecutor Shimada then began his questioning, asking about the specific methods of the Showa Restoration. Lieutenant Colonel Aizawa answered that it would naturally arise from the principles of human evolution, and that education, culture, and everything else must be reformed according to this principle. Prosecutor Shimada asked, then what measures should be taken against those who oppose the achievement of the Showa Restoration? Lieutenant Colonel Aizawa replied that a soldier would naturally have a determined attitude. Prosecutor Shimada asked if the defendant believed that Director Nagata was an obstacle to the Showa Restoration, wouldn't it have been possible to advise the director? Did the defendant also know that a soldier who kills his superior would be charged with the crime of killing a superior officer? Lieutenant Colonel Aizawa replied that he had no choice but to take this action for the sake of the nation. Prosecutor Shimada asked if the defendant thought that the Showa Restoration could succeed immediately by killing the director. Aizawa answered that while he did not think it could succeed immediately, he thought it could serve as the impetus for the Restoration. Shimada asked, knowing that it was a crime, the defendant still committed this heinous act, thinking that the Showa Restoration could excuse him from the crime? Aizawa's face turned red and he became visibly angry, answering, "What happens to this body is not something I care about." There was a recess at 11:34 AM, and the trial resumed at 1:00 PM. Special Defense Counsel Lieutenant Colonel Mitsui, with the permission of the presiding judge, made a supplementary interrogation. Afterward, Defense Counsel Mitsui argued for public access, saying that there had been a question of public versus private trial previously, but it was made public. The Empire did not have the slightest tremor because of this. The court adjourned at 1:13 PM. (6th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3>Nazi Party Leader Murdered; Germany Protests to Switzerland; Swiss Government Promises to Punish Culprit</h3>
<p>Berlin: Regarding the assassination of Nazi Party leader Gustloff, the German envoy to Switzerland was ordered to lodge a protest with the Swiss government. According to a recent public announcement, the German envoy expressed to the Swiss government that the German government hoped the Swiss authorities would take the necessary measures regarding this case, and stated that Swiss leftists had been launching major attacks on Gustloff in newspapers for months, indicating that the case had been premeditated for a long time. The President of the Swiss Federal Council, Mudar, assured the German envoy that the Swiss authorities would take the necessary measures to punish the murderer. (5th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>Berlin: Swiss Nazi Party leader Gustloff was assassinated yesterday in Davos, Switzerland, by Yugoslavian youth Frank Furt. It is believed here that because the murderer is of Jewish origin, it is a sign of Jewish animosity towards Nazism, and there is great outrage. The authorities have now ordered that all demonstrations of a Jewish cultural nature are prohibited without explicit permission. A public announcement interprets this order, saying that the government fears incidents may occur after Gustloff's assassination, so it is taking these emergency measures as a precaution. Jewish figures here are also shocked by Gustloff's assassination, saying that this is the beginning of Jewish opposition to Nazism, and they fear that it will cause the German authorities to intensify anti-Jewish measures.

<h3>Economic Matters: The Accounting Profession in China (Part 2) - Edited by Tang Qingzeng</h3>
<p>— Xu Yongzuo</p>
<p>A Brief History of the Establishment of the Accounting Profession in China: The accounting profession is not only a new and emerging profession in China, but its history is also not long in Europe and the United States. Although there have been professional auditors in England for hundreds of years, the development of the accounting profession has only been about sixty or seventy years. The presence of accountants in the United States is only over forty years old. As for China, its origins are less than twenty years old, and its development is even less than ten years. During the early years of the Republic of China, the Mixed Court of Shanghai, during the era of international public administration, referenced the foreign accounting system for appraisals in civil and criminal lawsuits related to monetary debts and appraised prices. Although at the time, those who accepted entrusted cases were all foreigners (notable examples include the English accountant Snow Myloh and the American audit firm, the American Audit Bureau), the accounting system was already imprinted in the minds of the Chinese people at that time. Later, in September of the seventh year of the Republic of China (1918), the Provisional Regulations for Accountants were promulgated by the former Beijing government, and Chinese nationals began to apply to become accountants. The first person was Xie Lin, who was then the chief accountant of the Bank of China. Following Xie, there were three or four people who served in the Ministry of Railways. Later, I also obtained my certificate in the tenth year of the Republic of China (1921). There were no more than ten people in total, and among the ten or so people who had obtained certificates at that time, there were virtually none who formally practiced the profession.</p>
<p>I recall that when I first became an accountant in the tenth year of the Republic of China, I only received one or two commissions throughout the year. However, because I was only working part-time at the time, I did not devote myself to it. It was not until the twelfth year of the Republic of China (1923), when the stock market crash occurred and business became difficult, that I devoted myself entirely to the accounting profession. The following year (i.e., the thirteenth year of the Republic of China (1924)), I also initiated the organization of the Shanghai Accountants Association, with the aim of using the strength of the group to promote the development of the accounting profession. Soon after, associations were also established in Tianjin and other places, and the number of members gradually increased. It was then that the accounting profession in China began to establish a foundation. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China (1927), the National Government was established, and the cultural institutions, systems, industry, and commerce of the country took on a new look. The accounting profession was able to take advantage of this opportunity to develop, but due to the progress of industry and commerce, it was still insufficient compared to the advanced countries of England and the United States.</p>
<p>The Current State of the Accounting Profession in China: As of April of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China (1935), there were a total of 1,162 accountants in China, and the number is still no more than 1,500. This number is so small that, not only is it far behind England and the United States, but it is also dwarfed by Japan's 7,000. Moreover, the majority of them are schoolteachers, company employees, or government officials, and those who can join the association and formally practice the profession are less than one-tenth of the total. This shows that the accounting profession in China has not been able to make great strides.</p>
<p>As for the state of the accounting profession in our country, it is nothing more than what is stipulated in Article 1 of the Accountants Ordinance. As mentioned earlier, the business of accountants should primarily be auditing, and other matters such as liquidation, certification, and appraisal should be secondary. There was originally no need to stipulate this by national law. However, in our country, when drafting the accounting regulations for the first time, it was deemed that the accounting system was a new creation. For the convenience of those who practiced the profession, regulations were listed in the law. Therefore, although the accounting regulations have been amended several times, there are still special articles to regulate the scope of their work. Article 1 of the current Accountants Ordinance contains the following provisions:</p>
<p>"Accountants may, upon the order of public institutions or the commission of ordinary persons, handle matters related to the organization, management, auditing, investigation, organization, liquidation, certification, and appraisal of accounting."</p>
<p>"Accountants may serve as inspectors, liquidators, bankruptcy trustees, executors of wills, and other trustees."</p>
<p>"Accountants may act as agents for tax payment and registration matters, and may draft various documents related to accounting and commerce."</p>
<p>These three provisions relating to the business of accountants have not been greatly changed in the successive revisions. However, what we should pay attention to is the third item, which is the drafting of documents. This type of business originally belonged to lawyers, and it is somewhat presumptuous for accountants to do it. Moreover, in foreign countries, there are few cases where accountants are used for this. However, there is a reason why this business is listed in the Chinese Accountants Ordinance. This business was added in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China (1927) when the Ministry of Finance of the National Government promulgated the Accountants Registration Regulations. At that time, in addition to my accounting work, I often answered questions about company registration and establishment registration for the companies that entrusted me. Occasionally, I would also draft documents for them. I felt that under the current situation in our country, it was quite convenient for accountants to also handle this type of business. Therefore, when I participated in drafting the Accountants Registration Regulations, I proposed that it be included in the articles. When it was explicitly stipulated by law, it became the business that accountants in our country should have.</p>
<p>Internal Organization of Accounting Firms: According to the main items of business, the internal organization of a firm can be roughly divided into the following departments:</p>
<p>Accounting Department: Handles auditing and design work.</p>
<p>Document Department: Handles the drafting of documents and correspondence.</p>
<p>Trust Department: Handles bankruptcy and liquidation matters.</p>
<p>General Affairs Department: Manages all general affairs.</p>
<p>In addition to these, in my firm, there is also a Publishing Department that handles the editing and publishing of accounting magazines and accounting books, a Training Department that handles accounting tutoring and correspondence schools, and a Service Department that promotes the improvement of Chinese bookkeeping and answers other accounting inquiries.</p>
<p>In foreign countries, accounting firms are all partnerships, and there are very few that are organized by individuals. Because they are all partnerships, the scope is very large. For example, the American Audit Bureau has branches in all major commercial ports around the world, and its internal staff numbers over 1,300. However, because they are all organized by individuals in our country, they cannot be as large as those in England and the United States. However, firms such as Lixin Accounting Firm and my firm both have over 30 employees. The Zhengze Accounting Firm also has over 10 employees. The rest have three or four or seven or eight employees.</p>
<p>Accountant's Remuneration: An accountant is a profession, so it is natural that they should receive remuneration. The standard for determining remuneration can be divided into two types: by time and by case. By time, the remuneration is determined by the length of time spent on the case. By case, the remuneration is determined by the difficulty of the case. In foreign countries, it is more common to charge by time, while in our country, it is all by case. In foreign countries, the standards set in the United States are the highest, with a senior accountant receiving 50 gold dollars per day and an assistant accountant receiving 25 gold dollars per day. In England, a senior accountant receives 5 pounds and 5 shillings per day, and an assistant accountant receives 2 pounds and 2 shillings per day. If it is necessary to charge by case, then it is calculated according to the estimated time. The amount of remuneration in our country is all negotiated on an ad hoc basis, and in practice, it varies greatly depending on the accountant's knowledge, experience, and social status. However, according to the standards set by the Shanghai Accountants Association, accountants are paid 50 yuan per day and clerks are paid 10 yuan per day. For cases, except for bankruptcy liquidation, the fees can be determined on an ad hoc basis depending on the circumstances of the case. However, in practice, ordinary auditing cases are rarely less than 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Compared to foreign countries, the accounting profession in our country is still quite immature. Given that it has a history of over ten years and is still so immature, one cannot help but sigh. The reason for this is that the general public has yet to have a deep understanding of the accounting profession. There is an English proverb that says, "A good manager depends entirely on a good accountant." This shows the thoroughness with which people in that country understand the accounting profession. However, when we look at our country, even the outstanding members of society often despise accountants, thinking that at most they are just bookkeepers. In addition, Chinese merchants are accustomed to not making their accounts public. Some even believe that hiring an accountant would only reveal their business secrets. Therefore, the opportunities to use accountants are naturally reduced. Is it perhaps because those who hold accounting certificates in our country do not start practicing immediately because they feel the difficulty of developing their business! At the same time, from the perspective of accountants in our country, they are not as skilled as those in England and the United States in terms of quality, and they are not as numerous as those in Europe and the United States in terms of quantity. State laws cannot help them as they do in England and the United States. It is fitting that the promotion of the accounting profession cannot be as prosperous as it is in England and the United States. It is hoped that our compatriots will do their best to promote it abroad, so that the public can understand the nature and effectiveness of the accounting profession. At the same time, accountants themselves should improve, making positive improvements in knowledge, experience, and professional ethics. It is hoped that the future of the accounting profession will have the hope of being developed and expanded.</p>

<h3>The Truth About the Changping Riot</h3>
<p>The Pseudo-Hebei-East Army and Security Team Compete for Defense – Both Sides Have Opened Fire Twice and Have Yet to Stop</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The unrest in Changping County, which began on the 26th of last month, has now lasted a full ten days. The conflict between the pseudo-army and the Security Team led by Feng Shoupeng has not ceased. It is still unknown whether the unrest will escalate. The cause of the unrest is that Feng Shoupeng's unit, the Third Brigade of the Fifth General Detachment of the War Zone Security Team, was stationed outside Chen Guan in the city. Except for a small squad of guards, all the troops were stationed at Longshan, six miles south of the city (six miles from the city). Feng's unit was originally reorganized from bandits in Yutian. When they were stationed in Yutian in the past, they caused trouble for the local area. Since arriving in Changping, they have been able to abide by discipline. The soldiers encourage each other, and they are on relatively good terms with the people. After Yin Rugeng established the pseudo-government in eastern Hebei, because Feng was far in the northwest corner, he did not accept the pseudo-order. Although County Magistrate Jing Weifan secretly colluded with the pseudo-government, he did not dare to openly resist because of Feng's presence. The Hebei Provincial Government ordered Yin to send someone to communicate with Feng. Feng refused to budge because he resented Yin Rugeng's assistance to Zhao Lei last year in forcing the unit to give up its defense area in Tangshan. As of January 23, Yin believed that it was difficult to resolve the situation without resorting to extremes, so he ordered Ning Yushi, the entire division of Liu Runyuan's army, a newly formed pseudo-Hebei army and government civilian self-governance army under the county, to march on foot through Fengrun, Jixian, Yutian, and head to Changping. Initially, they were stationed outside the city, ordering Feng Shoupeng's unit to go to Tongxian and give up the defense area. Feng refused and secretly issued warnings. On the 28th, the pseudo-army secretly contacted Jing Weifan and suddenly opened the city gate at dawn, welcoming the pseudo-army into the city. As a result, the pseudo-army directly entered the city and occupied public and private institutions and residences. It was the Lunar New Year, and the food prepared by merchants and residents for the festival was seized by the pseudo-army. Robberies occurred every night in the city. Feng Shoupeng, angered by the occupation of his defense area, was informed by merchants and residents, and on the 29th, he notified the pseudo-army to immediately withdraw from the city. The pseudo-army refused and instead surrounded the Security Team Headquarters outside Dongguan that afternoon, attempting to disarm the guards. The guards fought back, and a fierce conflict broke out. Feng's main force at Longshan also attacked the city that night, capturing and executing the son of pseudo-County Magistrate Jing Weifan. The two sides fought all night, with the sound of gunfire as dense as popping beans. Merchants and residents closed their doors and were not allowed to enter or exit. By noon on the 30th, the fighting had not stopped. Gentry and merchants in the city, fearing being caught in the crossfire, pleaded with both sides separately, intending to mediate. Feng Shoupeng's brigade headquarters immediately withdrew to Longshan, and the pseudo-army temporarily garrisoned the city. Feng agreed. On the morning of February 1, the gentry and merchants' mediation failed. Ning Yushi, the brigade commander of the pseudo-army, took a tough stance, saying that he was ordered to come, and Changping was now under his defense area, and Feng's unit must obey orders and go to Tongxian. At the same time, a certain group of ronin in the pseudo-army, serving as instructors and supervisors, supported Ning Yushi's claim. Feng Shoupeng, seeing no hope of getting his defense area back, attacked the city again on the night of the 1st. As of the 3rd, the fighting had not stopped. However, the pseudo-army numbered about 2,000 or more, while Feng Shoupeng's unit had only a little over a hundred. The advantage Feng's unit had was that it was equipped with mortars, mountain guns, and other heavy weapons, while the pseudo-army had only machine guns and rifles. Therefore, although the numbers were different, the strength was equal. Villagers and strongmen in the nearby villages had a slightly better impression of Feng's unit and secretly provided assistance. Feng is currently in a significant advantage. However, the pseudo-government has recently reported to the military headquarters, ordering them to obey the order and withdraw from the defense area in Tongxian, otherwise, the Hebei-East Air Force will be sent to bomb them (4th).</p>
<h3>Xie Jieshi: The Bombing Case in Taichung – The Details Were Not Released Until Two Months Later</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Xie Jieshi, the pseudo-Manchukuo ambassador to Japan, is originally from Taiwan. When Xie returned to Taiwan last year, the Taiwan Governor-General's Office welcomed him with great fanfare. On the morning of November 28th at 8:00 AM, Xie was traveling on the Taiwan Railway flower car from Alishan, passing through Chiayi Station. When the car stopped at the station, a bomb suddenly exploded in the waiting room of the station, the sound reverberating far and wide, and the order of the station was thrown into chaos. The crowd fled in panic, but fortunately, no one was injured. Afterward, the Taiwan authorities considered the matter serious and ordered the Tainan Police Station to investigate strictly. At the same time, they prohibited newspapers from publishing the incident. From then on, Xie Jieshi's movements were also prohibited from being reported in newspapers. The ban was not lifted until January 31st of this year, and the details of the case were released as follows. On December 28th, near the Akasaka Temple in Liujia, Zengwen County, about 50 to 60 lands away from the foot of the mountain, three places were found with the same explosive gunpowder. There were about 500 men and women gathered on the ground making medicine, claiming it was the "divine efficacy" of Akasaka Temple Mountain. The police bureau used this as a clue to investigate the bombing case at Chiayi Station. After two months, it was determined that the bomb maker was Wang Chuneng, a resident of No. 355 Shanhua Village, Xinhua County, Tainan Prefecture, 27 years old, who worked as a driver at the Xilun Motor Company in Xiluo Street, Jiayi County. As a result of the detention and interrogation, it was recognized that Wang was a machinery research and invention enthusiast, and he was prosecuted on January 24th for violating the Regulations on the Control of Guns, Cannons, and Explosives. Wang's motive for the crime was that when Wang drove a car, it always aroused his inventive thoughts. He wanted to find a way to attract car customers. He cooperated with two or three friends and spent hundreds of dollars in capital. One day, Wang suddenly remembered that the Mailiao Temple had the so-called "Ling Shan Immortal Elixir," and many people went to seek it, and the motor company and joss paper store made ten times the profit. He immediately purchased electrical machinery materials and gunpowder from Chiayi and wrote spells, roughly saying, "On the fifth day of the old calendar, at the hour of Mao, Ling rice will spray out from Mailiao Temple Mountain, buy it for the common people, the rest is military advisor Liu Bowen," and posted them everywhere. He then loaded the gunpowder into bamboo tubes purchased from a firecracker shop, eight inches long and one inch in diameter, and made them on November 27th. He planned to chant spells and draw symbols in the market and then detonate them to induce superstition. On the 28th, when he carried the explosives to Chiayi Station, Xie Jieshi happened to arrive at the station, and there were many supporters. He then placed the explosives in the third waiting room, lit the fuse, and fled. The explosion occurred at noon, and the sound was like a bomb. The above is the account released by the authorities after two months, seemingly unrelated to the bomb and Xie. However, the Taiwan authorities initially promoted and publicized Xie's return, but after the bombing case, there was not a single word about Xie's whereabouts, which is enough to arouse suspicion (February 5).</p>
<h3>Jing Yuexiu Killed by Accidental Gunshot Wound</h3>
<p>Patrolling Back Home, the Personally Carried Handgun Fell to the Ground – The Bullet Exploded and Hit the Vital Area of the Chest – Gao Shuangcheng Temporarily Acts as Division Commander</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Jing Yue, the commander of the 86th Division stationed in northern Shaanxi, died on the 31st of last month due to a handgun falling to the ground and misfiring, causing injury. People from all sides were deeply saddened by the news. Northern Shaanxi and Shanxi are closely connected, and Jing had very close personal relationships with military and political figures in Shanxi, such as Yan and Xu. Therefore, a public funeral office was specially set up in Taiyuan to handle all matters. Jing himself often came to Taiyuan to visit and stay. Recently, the military affairs of suppressing bandits in northern Shaanxi have made the relationship between Jing and Shanxi even closer. Therefore, Jing's death is of particular concern to Taiyuan. The news obtained from the Taiyuan side is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Details of the Incident: Jing attached great importance to the city defense in Yulin and personally led his entourage on a walking inspection every day, which he had done for nearly 20 years. At about 2:00 PM on the 31st of last month, Jing returned from patrolling and went straight back to his private residence. After entering the room, he quickly took off his coat. Unexpectedly, a fully loaded Browning handgun was in the inner pocket, and it suddenly fell to the ground. Jing bent down to pick it up. Unfortunately, when the handgun fell to the ground, the muzzle was pointed upwards. Just as Jing bent over, there was a loud bang, and Jing fell to the ground in response. The attendants entered the room to check, and Jing was lying in a pool of blood, groaning. The guards rushed forward to help him up and called for military medical personnel to carry him to the bed and perform emergency treatment. Unfortunately, the injury was in a vital area, and the treatment was ineffective. He died at about 3:00 AM on the 1st.</p>
<p>Oral Will: After being injured, Jing knew that there was no hope of survival. He summoned his Chief of Staff, Ma Jinhou, and other important personnel of the division to his bedside to instruct them on matters after his death. He earnestly instructed them to inform his troops that the country was in turmoil and bandits were spreading, and they must work hard to suppress the bandits, eliminate the hidden dangers in the northwest, and serve the country faithfully to fulfill their military duties. As for the position of division commander, because Brigade Commander Gao Shuangcheng is experienced and prudent, refined in his conduct, and trusted by all officers and soldiers of the division and loved by the local people, they should immediately telegraph Mizhi County to summon him to return to Yulin day and night to act as division commander and take charge of everything.</p>
<p>Jing's Brief Biography: Jing, courtesy name Songsheng, is from Pu, Shaanxi, and is now 57 years old. He was a military officer in the Qing Dynasty. During the Xinhai Revolution, he joined the Shaanxi Revolutionary Army led by Zhang Feng. In 1914, Zhang's unit was reorganized, and Jing was promoted to the commander of the 4th Regiment of the 2nd Mixed Brigade of the Shaanxi Army. In 1917, he was appointed by the Beiyang Government as the garrison commander of northern Shaanxi. In 1922, he was reorganized into the 3rd Division of the National Third Army and the commander-in-chief of the Shaanxi National Army. In 1923, he was appointed by Wu Peifu, the commander-in-chief of the Allied Forces, as the commander-in-chief of the Northwest Route Allied Forces. In 1927, he was appointed by Feng Yuxiang, the commander-in-chief of the National Revolutionary Army, as the deputy commander of the Second Group Army. In 1928, he was ordered to be reorganized into the Provisional 18th Division and appointed by the General Headquarters of the National Revolutionary Army as the commander of the 12th Army of the Punitive Army. In November 1931, he was ordered to be reorganized into the commander of the 86th Division of the Army, and he has retained this designation to this day. Jing had a younger brother, Wumu, who was a revolutionary giant in the past but unfortunately died young. Jing left behind a wife and concubine each, five sons and one daughter. The eldest son is now 22 years old and recently graduated from Luoyang Military Academy and returned to Yulin. The rest are still young. The daughter is married.</p>
<p>Aftermath: Regarding Jing's funeral and other aftermath issues of the division, personnel from various departments of the division, in addition to handling matters in accordance with the will, now Brigade Commander Gao Shuangcheng, stationed in Mizhi, and Deputy Division Commander Li Fanhou, stationed in Suide, have returned to Yulin after hearing the news to preside over the aftermath. After Yan Xishan, the Pacification Director of Taiyuan, and Xu Yongchang, the chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government, received the bad news of Jing's death, in addition to sending telegrams to his family to express their condolences, they also sent a joint telegram to the central government, stating that Yulin is located in a dangerous area and is currently in the midst of bandit suppression, and the military affairs at the front cannot be left unattended. They requested the appointment of Gao Shuangcheng as the commander of the 86th Division to take charge of the responsibility. Gao is 46 years old and is a fellow countryman of Jing, also from Pucheng. The strength of Jing's unit is all controlled by Gao, and he is brave and good at fighting. He has been with Jing for many years and is highly respected by the personnel of the division (February 2).</p>
<h3>Yu Xuezhong's Governance Measures in Gansu</h3>
<p>Prohibiting Counties from Arbitrarily Levying Funds from Local Areas – Formulating an Outline of Administrative Plans</p>
<p>Lanzhou Correspondence: Since taking office, Yu Xuezhong, the chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, has been very active in various administrative measures. A brief record is as follows: (1) Chairman Yu, in view of the fact that the counties of this province have suffered repeated disasters and wars, and the people's livelihood is declining, believes that strictly prohibiting exploitation is necessary to relieve the people's plight. However, in the past, many county magistrates failed to obtain approval and levied funds from local areas at will. Although the local undertakings they were in charge of were actually needed, the procedures were lacking, causing resentment among the people. Recently, a strict order has been issued to prohibit counties from arbitrarily levying funds. Those who violate the order will be severely punished according to law, and the levied funds will be recovered in full, with no leniency. (2) Chairman Yu believes that the financial revenue and expenditure of Gansu Province differ greatly, and if relief is not sought urgently, the deficit will only increase and become unmanageable. Therefore, he is determined to reorganize it and implement the budget approved by the administrative headquarters in order to limit it somewhat. It is heard that from January 25th, all organs will have all expenses exceeding the budget suspended, so that the finances of this province will gradually return to normal. (3) In order to promote the county administration of various counties this year, Chairman Yu ordered the Department of Civil Affairs to formulate an outline of administrative plans, which are comprehensive in education, health, and defense. The outline is roughly as follows: (1) Reorganize the granaries in various counties; (2) Reorganize the scattered lands in various counties; (3) Enforce the opium ban; (4) Carry out social relief; (5) Train Baoding and strong men; (6) Reform the county government organization; (7) Implement training for county administration personnel; (8) Increase administrative expenses; (9) Protect county administrative personnel; (10) Organize land reporting; (11) Improve public education; (12) Establish health hospitals; (4) Chairman Yu believes that during the current period of bandit suppression in the Northwest, the people need a sound organization to defend themselves and achieve the effect of clearing the bandits. He is determined to train Baoding and strongmen. Baoding training centers have been established in 28 counties, including Lanzhou, to implement training in stages. The Baoding chiefs will all be trained, and it is heard that a certain section chief has been sent to Guizhou Province to conduct field investigations in order to learn from the successful experiences in Baoding management in Guizhou and improve the system.</p>
<h3>Building the Bai Mao Sluice Gate and Water Conservancy in Various Counties in Southern Jiangsu: Zhou Zhenhua</h3>
<p>Changshu Correspondence: The National Economic Commission has allocated 300,000 yuan to dredge the water conservancy of various counties in Jiangsu Province and prevent floods and droughts. It has entrusted the Yangzhou Water Conservancy Committee to plan the construction of a huge sluice gate at Baimao Estuary in Changshu. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on the 30th of last month. This project is rare in Jiangsu Province and is related to the water conservancy of Su, Chang, Kun, Tai, Cheng, Xi and other counties. The authorities attach great importance to it. At the groundbreaking ceremony the other day, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi and Director of the Water Conservancy Commission Chuan Rulin personally presided over everything twice in Dongzhang City, which is enough to prove the importance of the sluice gate. It is now scheduled to be completed in eight months. After that, Su, Chang and other counties can open the sluice to introduce river water in times of drought and discharge water to the outside in times of flood, and there will never be floods or droughts. The position of Baimao Sluice Gate, its relationship with the water conservancy of various parties, and the previous textual research relationships are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Location of the Baimao River: The Baimao River is located in the southeast of Changshu County, Jiangsu, passing through Baimao Town, flowing northeast through Zhitang and entering the Yangtze River at Baimao Estuary. Its distant source actually starts from the Sandun Estuary of Taihu Lake, runs through Caohu Lake and Jialing Lake and reaches Changshu County. It is 161 miles long from Hedun Estuary to Baimao Estuary. It is close to Shang Lake (West Lake of Changshu) and Kuncheng Lake, and far connected to Yangcheng Lake and Bacheng Lake. With the connection of branches and ports, it is actually a huge flow for Taihu Lake to discharge floodwater.</p>
<p>The Relationship between Baimao and Taihu Lake: In the past, Wang Yi's "Records of Water Management in Wujun" stated, "The water from the southeast gathers in Taihu Lake and enters the sea through the Sanjiang River. But Sanjiang River has lost its old course, and Dongjiang River cannot be found again. Only Loujiang River still exists, and the Wusong River is present but mostly dry. Another branch flows out of it and enters the sea from Baimao Port in Changshu, which is the largest and fastest." It also says: "Taihu Lake swallows many streams, just like a person's abdomen. Baimao and Wusong are like the tail plate. Yangcheng Lake, Kuncheng Lake, and Weiting Lake are like meridians. If the tail plate is not discharged, the abdomen will swell and cause disease, and all four limbs and hundreds of meridians will be diseased." From this, the relationship between Baimao and Taihu Lake can be said to be important.</p>
<p>The Relationship between Baimao and the Water Conservancy of Various Counties: Although the Baimao River is not very long, its tributaries are connected and surround hundreds of miles. It has a great relationship with the water conservancy of Jiangyin, Wuxi, Wuxian, Kunshan, and Taicang. Therefore, Mu Tianyan requested to dredge the Baimao Port, saying, "Baimao Port in Changshu is the first important river in Southern Jiangsu that flows northeast into the river. It has been neglected and buried to become land since the late Ming Dynasty. In times of drought, tides cannot come, and in times of flood, there is no way to discharge floodwater. If this port is connected, not only will Changshu be free from floods and droughts, but Kunshan, Changzhou, Taicang, Wuxi, and Jiangyin will also benefit." Liu Dingyi's "Discussion on Dredging the Baimao River" also states, "The flow of Taihu Lake from Changzhou and Wuxi eastward flows into the sea through Baimao. Once Baimao is blocked, not only will Changshu become a ravine, but the waters in Changzhou, Wuxi and other places will have nowhere to discharge and will overflow and be on the verge of danger."</p>
<p>The Current Situation of the Baimao River: Before 1913, the Baimao River was very wide above Zhitang Town, and the water volume was always six or seven feet. After driving under Zhitang, the water volume was shallower. From here down to Maochai Bay, it was five feet six inches deep and four feet shallow. From Zhu Jiaxiang and Jiang Jiawan, it was about three feet eight inches deep, and the water surface was four or five feet. The river surface was narrower and the water was shallower. From the pawnshop bridge down, it was four folds to Qin Jiawan. The width of the river surface varied by one foot inside and outside, with a flat and slow flow. The center of the river was only two feet deep. From here down to the Baimao Gate (the former new gate), it was about one foot five or six wide and only three feet five inches deep in deep places. The new gate was less than ten miles from the estuary.</p>
<p>The First Major Dredging of the Baimao River: During the Zhizheng period of the Yuan Dynasty, Baimao was blocked by reeds and the stream was impassable. Zhang Shicheng raised an army of 100,000, with Zhitang as the administrative government, stationed in Shanjing Estuary, and ordered Lu Zhen to supervise the dredging, trenching its land into a port, 90 miles long and 36 feet wide. This was the first major beach in Baimao. The dredgers in the Ming Dynasty were Shangshu Yuan Ji in the second year of Yongle, Shilang Xu Guan in the seventh year of Hongzhi, Xunfu Li Chongsi in the first year of Jiajing, and Xunfu Hai Rui in the third year of Longqing. Although the results were remarkable, it could not exceed the width of 36 feet.</p>
<p>The Importance of Building a Sluice Gate in Baimao: The harm of tides cannot be overstated, so it is necessary to store clear water and reject turbid water. According to old rules, gates should be set up at the docks to defend against tides. In the past, Fan Wenzheng also discussed water conservancy, and he placed equal emphasis on building gates, repairing enclosures, and dredging rivers. Many people who continued to build relied on this theory, or advocated building gates and dams together to expand their benefits. The old records say, "The Baimao River has always been tortuous and winding, so the mud and sand cannot rush straight. Building a gate at the estuary and discharging water at any time, the water cannot surge high and advance, so it is very important to store floodwater and prevent droughts." This is the importance of building a sluice gate.</p>
<p>The Rise and Fall of Sluice Gate Construction in Baimao: In the second year of Longqing in the Ming Dynasty, County Magistrate Zhang Bo built a stone gate at Baimao Port. This was the beginning of the construction of the sluice gate. In the 48th year of Kangxi in the Qing Dynasty, Governor-General Bumbu and others奏准 修建白茆康熙四十八年。 Governor-General Shao Bumbu and others奏准 修建白茆old warehouse, and in the second year of Daoguang, the old and new gates were rebuilt and opened and closed in time. This was the increase in the construction of the gate. In the seventh year of Tongzhi, Xunfu Ding Richang founded the Baimao Dredging and moved the stone gate to the east of the new gate of Su and Chang. This was the relocation of the gate. However, the gates built were mostly collapsed and destroyed soon. At that time, the mouth of the gate was eight feet eight inches wide and the gate hole was one foot six inches. It can be seen that the scale of the gate built in the past was not as great as that of the recent times, but it was also a great project.</p>
<p>The Motivation for Building a Sluice Gate in Baimao: In 1931 and 1934, the Taihu Lake Basin suffered from floods and droughts, which could not be salvaged. Although it was due to bad weather, it was actually caused by poor human planning. Therefore, to quell droughts and floods, we must dredge rivers, set up sluice gates, repair embankments, and build reservoirs. However, it is difficult to carry out various projects at the same time, so we must first build the gates through the river to prepare for droughts and floods. The gates through the river are the most important in Yunzao Port, Liuhe Estuary, Qipu Estuary, Baimao Estuary, Huangtiangang, Menghe Estuary, and Zhenjiang Canal Estuary. All gates above Huangtiangang (Jiangyin and above) were built by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the rest were planned and carried out by the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission. It is now stipulated that the Baimao Gate is related to the water conservancy of several counties, so it is the earliest construction.</p>
<p>The Survey of the Bai Mao Sluice Gate Site: The Bai Mao River originally had an old gate and a new gate (South New and North New). However, the accumulation outside the gate was very fast and it was soon blocked, causing the effect of the gate to be completely lost. It was then abandoned. In 1914, the wood piles and the gate base solidified with sand and ash were still left at the South New Gate, but the rest of the gate base was also removed. Therefore, the site of this gate must first be measured to determine its landform and examine its circumstances. The encroachment of the tide and the discharge of internal water should be carefully surveyed before the gate site can be determined. It has now been surveyed at the curved part near the South New Gate, about seven miles from the Bai Mao Estuary. The width there is about fifteen feet, which is suitable for the average width of the river body. A new diversion river about 140 feet long will be built, and the gate will be built on it, so that the scouring of the tide can be avoided. The gate will be built outside the silt prevention, that is, the gate built will be slightly smaller than the river bed section, so that the east water can wash away the silt. The base occupies about 80 mu of farmland, which will be bought at a price in the area.</p>
<p>The Benefits of Building the Bai Mao Sluice Gate: The height of the gate is based on the highest tide level in the Yangtze River, and the height of the gate sill is 1.58 meters below the Wusong sea level zero point. The gate has five holes, each hole is 7.4 meters wide, the gate length is 44 meters, a bridge surface is erected on the gate, to connect the automobile highway in the future, the entire gate is made of steel and concrete, the gate is suspended, and the weight is balanced by the average weight, and a hoisting hand crank is installed to control the opening and closing of the gate, if so, it is simple and labor-saving, it is closed when the tide comes, and opened when the tide goes, to facilitate the discharge and navigation, such as the discharge of low water in winter and spring is controlled, droughts and floods are prepared, sediment is stored in the old way, and the tide is rejected outside the gate, with the power of scouring, there is no risk of collapse, and the counties in Southern Jiangsu will benefit.</p>

<h3>Yesterday, Two Groups Welcomed the German Inspection Delegation; Kopp Delivered a Speech on German Economic Problems</h3>
<p>Hitler's Leadership of the Revival Policy Has Been Effective; the Similarity Between the Two Nations Should Lead to Mutual Assistance</p>
<p>According to the New Sound Society, Mr. Kopp, head of the German Far East Economic Inspection Delegation, and Mr. Rosenblum, a member of the delegation, have been inspecting Shanghai for days since arriving in Shanghai from Beijing on the 31st of last month. They are scheduled to go to Beijing again next Monday and then to Tianjin and other places. The International Problem Research Association of this city and the China International Trade Association held a tea party at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 5:30 p.m. yesterday to welcome the delegation. Mr. Kopp, the head of the delegation, gave a speech on "Germany's Current Economic Problems." The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>On the host side, the attendees included Guo Bingwen, Li Fusun, Xu Xinliu, Liu Zhanen, Li Zhaohuan, Xu Peihuang, Tang Baoshu, Bei Songsun, Qian Xinzhi, Chen Guangfu, Lin Kanghou, Zou Bingwen, Kuang Yaokun, and other directors and members of the International Problem Research Association and the International Trade Association. On the guest side, in addition to the head of the delegation, Mr. Kopp, and the member, Mr. Rosenblum, there were also the German Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Kleebe, Consul Mr. Bai Rende, Vice-Consul Mr. Lido, Chairman of the German Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Paulsen, Vice-Chairman Mr. Wei Bo, Chairman of the German Overseas Chinese Federation, Mr. Wiedemann, etc., with more than 120 guests and hosts in total. Guo Bingwen presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>Welcome Speech After taking their seats, Mr. Li Fusun gave a welcome speech in English on behalf of the association, saying: "It is a great pleasure for me, as the chairman of the China Trade Association, to welcome Dr. Kopp and Dr. Rosenblum at this reception hosted by the International Problem Research Association and the China International Trade Association. Dr. Kopp is the head of the German Economic Inspection Delegation, a senior official of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and has been granted the title of Minister by the government. Dr. Rosenblum is a member of the German Economic Inspection Delegation and a senior staff member of the German Reichsbank. We sincerely welcome the two gentlemen to Shanghai and express our best wishes for the delegation's successful results in our country. Standing on our own position, we should provide assistance in various ways to achieve mutually beneficial results. I remember with pleasure my visit to Germany eighteen months ago, when I had the opportunity to meet Dr. Schacht, the Minister of Economic Affairs and President of the German Bank, and other government officials and banking and business circles to discuss trade relations. We came up with various possible ways to increase trade and close friendship between our two countries. I would now like to mention the main points of Dr. Schacht's conversation with me, such as that the principle of equality and mutual benefit must be followed between the two countries, and not only Germany must increase its exports to China, but China must also be able to export to Germany. Only in this way can China offset the increased purchases of German goods. I am very pleased that since my visit to Germany eighteen months ago, trade between China and Germany has made significant progress. Not only have China's exports to Germany increased, but Germany's exports to China have also increased, especially railway materials. This satisfactory trend must be promoted as much as possible. Therefore, the arrival of the German Economic Inspection Delegation in China is very important. It is appropriate for the delegation to come to China at a time when the relationship of trade understanding between China and Germany is growing, which should be welcomed by us. Although our arrival in the province (referring to the delegation) still allows us to see our economic downturn, this is a common phenomenon all over the world. If we eliminate this phenomenon more slowly, we should also remember that it has entered our country later than other countries. I don't want to waste your time. I think you are all like me, looking forward to hearing Dr. Kopp's valuable opinions. Finally, I must repeat my words. We not only welcome the delegation, but also hope that it will achieve success and results in our country," etc. After Mr. Li finished his speech, Mr. Kopp took the floor to speak.</p>
<p>Mr. Kopp's Speech Dr. Kopp first expressed his gratitude for the banquet and praised Shanghai's important position in international trade and finance as the gateway for Chinese and foreign trade. Then he said that the purpose of the delegation was to promote the friendship between the German business community and the commercial centers of the Far East, and to serve the governments and business communities of various countries that are interested in German trade with sincerity, such as explaining the organization of German foreign trade agencies, the products needed by the German market, and the manufactured goods exported by Germany. He said that the world crisis is most serious in the shrinking of international trade, which is mostly caused by tariff barriers and exchange controls, but the biggest reason is the result of the war, the sharp reduction in purchasing power, and the debts arising from this reason. After these huge debts are gradually paid off, trade can gradually recover. In addition to the above-mentioned natural law, there are also ways for individuals, governments, and various commercial groups to help. The commercial inspection delegations in various parts of the world are the organizations for this work, which are used to promote international trade exchange provisions to supply each other's needs. Then he talked about the problems caused by Germany's heavy foreign debt burden as a result of the war, which are extremely acute. The sacrifices made by the Germans as a result of this are far greater than those of other countries. The Treaty of Versailles had repeatedly placed Germany in an irreparable position, which was due to the Dawes and Young plans, the cessation of lending to German accounts. The organization of the national economy was almost completely ruined in 1933. At that time, the political, economic, and social situation in Germany was extremely complex. The government led by Hitler then came forward and established a policy of reconstruction and revival, which has now achieved considerable results. In addition to reaffirming national defense and establishing political independence, Germany has also implemented various projects and facilities, land reclamation, road construction, and other plans. As a result, the number of unemployed people in Germany has been reduced from 6.5 million in 1933 to 2 million today. The above-mentioned work is extremely difficult and almost risky in a nearly bankrupt Germany, and its success cannot but be attributed to the political banker Dr. Schacht. He was appointed by Hitler as the Governor of the Federal Bank and the Minister of Economic Affairs, with the sole authority to do so. Various countries have criticized the methods he used, and the most serious of them have said that his actions completely disregard the interests of Germany's creditors. However, this provision for maintaining Germany's monetary system and finance, as well as debt, is the only way to avoid losses to Germany's creditors. Under this method, Germans with foreign debt have the power to pay it off. Debtors not only pay interest, but also repay the principal, but they cannot transfer the amount repaid to foreign creditors, because Germany lacks foreign exchange. This shortage was entirely created by foreign creditors who forced the recovery of the loans in 1930, that is, various countries forced the recovery beyond Germany's economic capacity. On the German side, they only advised them to invest in Germany, such as the so-called 12 million gold mark repayment plan, which is enough to show the shortage of foreign exchange. Although Germany has been sacrificing amounts to repay foreign debts and exceeding the number of international trade since 1930, under this method and the monetary situation of various countries, Germany's foreign debt has been reduced by more than half since 1930, and it is still continuing to pay off. In the near future, Germany's foreign economic and trade position can be restored. In addition to organizing domestic chips, Schacht completely reorganized Germany's foreign trade with new methods, aiming to offset imports and exports to avoid new debts. Although the government often participates in the system, Germany tries its best to adjust the commercial relations and needs of various countries with Germany, taking care of each other to maintain Germany's purchasing power and recover in the fastest time. Under this new law, especially on the import side, there have been many changes, that is, food and industrial raw materials have been restricted, and they have turned to buying raw materials from countries that produce German products. Germany's overseas colonies cannot supply the needed raw materials, so it has tried its best to promote trade with countries that produce raw materials and need industrial products. Trade between China and Germany has more hope for expansion because of these situations, that is, under the world economic downturn, this situation has also been developing in recent years, and Germany's imports of Chinese products have gradually increased, while exports have gradually decreased, which is the opposite of the above-mentioned new method. Under the successful development of natural resources by the National Government, Germany will purchase sufficient raw materials and minerals in China in the future. In this way, the economic relationship between the two countries is very fortunate, and I wish this will become thicker and thicker, and with the similarities between the two nations, such as the losses they have suffered in the past, in the future, we should obtain mutual assistance from the commercial relations between the two countries to achieve the revival of the two countries and the happiness of the two nations.</p>

<p>Chinese and Foreign Banks Cooperate to Stabilize Foreign Exchange; the US Dollar is Indeed Extended to 30.25 Yuan</p>
<p>According to the New Sound Society, after the three banks of China, China, and Communications restricted the buying and selling of foreign exchange, although foreign bank prices plummeted, foreign banks restricted the buying and selling, and the three banks tried their best to stabilize, which was effective. Now, after consultation with the three banks, it has been decided to list the US dollar exchange rate at 29.75 US dollars and extend it to 30.25 US dollars. At the same time, it has been agreed with the British HSBC Bank that, in order to cooperate and stabilize foreign exchange, the US dollar exchange rate will be listed at 29.50 US dollars and extended to 30 US dollars.

<h3>Starting Today, the North China Air Route is Completely Cut Off</h3>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Ships in Shanghai Have Stopped Going; Shipping Companies Are Busy Rescuing Ships</p>
<p>The spring in North China is unusually cold, and the ice is frozen to the outside of Dagukou, making it difficult for Chinese and foreign merchant ships traveling to and from Shanghai. Those who encounter danger and damage are even more numerous. From today onwards, ships from Shanghai to Beiyang have been completely cut off, which has a huge impact on transportation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Supplying Coal and Grain The British Taikoo Company's merchant ships, which are surrounded by solid ice outside Dagukou and cannot advance or retreat, include Xin Shuntian, Huizhou, Nanning, and Hubei. Because the ice field on the sea is hundreds of miles wide, they have been surrounded for many days and cannot break through, resulting in the depletion of food and coal. Yesterday, Taikoo Company received a report and specially sent the Haikou ship to Dalian to load a large amount of food and coal to the sea outside Dagukou, intending to break the ice and advance to provide relief. Now Haikou has departed from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Busy Rescuing Since the ice at Dagukou was cut off, the Ruikang ship of Shou Kang Wheel, a Chinese merchant ship, has been trapped at sea for many days. The company agreed with the China Ship Insurance Federation yesterday and has asked the British Zizhi Foreign Firm in this city to send a rescue ship to rescue it. There are many other merchant ships that have been trapped, and they have also contacted the foreign firm one after another these days, asking them to send ships separately to rescue them. The Zizhi rescue ship and the icebreaker ship are really overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Suspension of Navigation to Beiyang After the Tianjin air route was blocked earlier, there were still two places, Yantai and Weihaiwei, where ships could pass. Now even Yantai and Weihaiwei are frozen. The three major ports in North China can be said to be completely closed, which is the first time in 30 years. When the Tianjin air route was blocked two weeks ago, foreign exports could still be opened, but now it is impossible to go there. Except for Taikoo's Yuezhou wheel, which still goes to Qingdao to wait for news, from today onwards, Chinese and foreign merchant ships in Shanghai will temporarily not open the blocked air route to North China.</p>
<h3>The French Concession Taxpayers' Association Protests Against the Telephone Price Increase</h3>
<p>Listing in Detail the Points That Are Unreasonable; Sending a Letter to the Board of Directors for Serious Consideration</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company in the concession is increasing prices in disguised form, and the implementation period is approaching. The Board of Directors of the French Concession Public Works Bureau will hold a meeting on the 15th to make a final discussion. For this reason, the Taxpayers' Association of Chinese in the French Concession sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau to oppose the new charging system and listed the company's errors that do not meet the public's wishes. The original text is: "Dear Sirs, the Shanghai Telephone Company's rate change issue will be finally studied by the Board of Directors of your Public Works Bureau on the 15th of this month. At that time, it will be able to adopt public opinions widely, follow public opinion, and make a final veto to the citizens' criticism. Our association only lists the points of the telephone company's rate change that are unreasonable and submits them to the bureau for consideration. It is known that the telephone is a public utility, and its purpose is to facilitate the public. Therefore, the remuneration obtained from its business can only be limited to the minimum interest that conforms to the invested capital. It is absolutely not allowed to compare it with other businesses that generate profits, which is very obvious. Now the telephone company is applying for a rate change on the pretext that the company's profits have not reached the budgeted number, which is fundamentally wrong. This is the first point that is unreasonable. It is known that since the new company took over in the 17th year of the Republic of China, its profits have been in the hundreds of thousands of yuan every year, which is because it has invested in assets, resulting in interest not being paid. However, the company's own assets and equipment are complete. From then on, even if the price is not increased, its profit will be more than enough. How can it make demands recklessly? This is a greedy and insatiable behavior. This is the second point that is unreasonable. The balance of the telephone company's current rate is not worth mentioning. However, in view of the current world economic situation and the extreme panic, Shanghai citizens are burdened with the telephone bills paid at the current rate due to the decline of commerce and the survival. It has indeed reached the highest limit, and it is only because the telephone restrictions are generous that it can barely obtain the effect of the telephone under extreme burden. If the world economy cannot recover one day, and the Shanghai economy is always shrouded in the fog of economic panic and cannot restore the prosperity of a few years ago, then the suitability of the current telephone rate should become a problem. At this time, it is a big mistake to suddenly change the rate and extract a large amount of money, which will inevitably lead to a situation where it cannot afford to pay the fee and is dismantled. This is the third point that is unreasonable. Now, let's discuss the new chapter of the telephone company's proposed rate change, which limits residential telephones to 100 calls per month and commercial telephones to 150 calls. Beyond this, 3 cents will be charged for each call. On the surface, the rate charged per call seems to decrease, but because the number of calls is limited, it is more stringent than before, so the increase between the two is more than doubled. Moreover, according to the experience, there are more than five to ten calls per household per day for residential telephones, and all of them are like this. The number of calls per household per day for commercial telephones is always around 30 to 50 calls if the average is calculated for the financial industry and busy commercial firms. Now, one is limited to three calls and a few, and the other is limited to four calls and a few. This kind of restriction is probably not applicable to the simplest telephone users in the world. Once implemented, any user in the city will uniformly increase the burden by three to five or six times, and no one will be spared. It is already obvious that the telephone company intends to use its business opportunities to extract money. Furthermore, the ratio between the number of calls for residential telephones and commercial telephones in the new chapter is 3.3 and 4.9. The difference in the complexity of the use of telephones in commerce and household affairs is very different from the above ratio. The telephone company's new chapter creates a ratio of 3.3 and 4.9 based on unreasonable and irrational guesses, which proves that it has not taken into account the interests of the citizens at all, and the rate change is completely monopolistic and selfish, and implements fishing with exhaustible resources. It also uses the authority of the Public Works Bureau to catch turtles in a jar. If it is said that for those who make fewer calls, it is the only remuneration, isn't it just laughing at yourself? Based on all these kinds of things, it has exposed its loss of the qualifications to run a public utility. Our association is a humble representative of the citizens, and its duty is to summarize the reasons why the citizens oppose the telephone company's rate change as above and appeal to your bureau to seriously consider it when studying this issue, so as to generate a decision that is credible and meets the public's expectations, and a strong and powerful resistance can be realized. The citizens are very fortunate. Sincerely, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the French Concession Public Works Bureau."</p>
<h3>Board of Directors and Manager's Office of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Expedite Closing Preparations for Handover</h3>
<p>Cai Zengji and Tan Boying Arrived at the Bureau on the 10th to Assume Their New Posts; Secretaries and Department Heads All Requested Resignations</p>
<p>After the resignations of Ye Zuotang, Lv Xuepu, General Manager Liu Hongsheng, and all other directors and supervisors of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company were approved, Cai Zengji was appointed as General Manager, and Tan Boying as Deputy General Manager. They were scheduled to take over on the morning of the 10th. The Board of Directors, Supervisory Board, and the various departments of the General Manager's Office were ordered to expedite the closing and handover. Department heads submitted requests for resignation. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Various Departments Expedite Closing - General Manager Liu Hongsheng Notified the Secretariat on the 5th</p>
<p>Chief Secretary Xu Zhiyi was notified on the 5th by General Manager Liu Hongsheng to expedite the closing and prepare for the handover. The Secretariat immediately instructed Chen Weiqing, Director of the General Affairs Department; Zhang Dingzhi, Director of the Accounting Department; He Molin, Director of the Business Department; Zhao Yuntai, Director of the Ship Department; and others to begin closing procedures immediately. Therefore, the various departments of the bureau were busy yesterday expediting the closing. The Supervisory Board, managed by Secretary Wu Rengtai, and the Board of Directors, managed by Secretary Wu Xianzhong, were responsible for the closing, which was scheduled to be completed by the 9th. However, during the transition period, business operations continued as usual.</p>
<p>Cai and Tan to Take Over on the 10th - Cai Zengji and Tan Boying, after being appointed as the incoming General Manager and Deputy General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. They also consulted with the former General Manager, Liu Hongsheng. They are scheduled to arrive at the bureau at 9:00 AM on the 10th (Monday) to take over. The Board of Directors, Supervisory Board, and the General Manager's Office are currently expediting the closing and will proceed with the handover immediately after receiving the order from the Ministry. With the exception of He Molin, Director of the Business Department, and Yao Bolong, Deputy Director of the General Affairs Department, who have other positions to take, the other department heads plan to jointly submit their resignations to the former General Manager Liu.</p>
<p>Amendment of Organizational Charter - The organizational charter of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, as revised and promulgated on June 1, 1935, stipulated the establishment of a Board of Directors, composed of nine to thirteen supervisors, and a Board of Directors, composed of eleven to seventeen directors. The General Manager's Office was to be headed by one General Manager. Now, the Board of Directors and Supervisors has decided to abolish it and add one Deputy General Manager. The original charter has been revised by the Ministry of Communications and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and will be promulgated by order of the National Government.</p>
<p>Cai Resigns from Two Bureau Chief Positions - Cai believes that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is the most important shipping agency in the country. After taking office, he will find it difficult to concurrently hold the positions of Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau and the Land Bureau. He has now decided to submit his resignation to Mayor Wu. The Municipal Government is currently considering candidates to succeed him.</p>
<h3>Du Yuesheng and Others Hosted a Banquet for Xu Shiying Yesterday - Xu Scheduled to Leave for His Post Early Next Month</h3>
<p>Xu Shiying, the newly appointed second ambassador to Japan, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago. He has been busy attending tea parties hosted by Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi, shareholder meetings of the Kwong Hua Oil Company, and having his ambassadorial attire tailored. Du Yuesheng, Yu Zhiqing, Zhang Xiaolin, Yu Zuoting, Yang Hu, Chu Minyi, Wang Xiaoxiang, Qian Xinzhi, and others, on the occasion of Xu's imminent departure, hosted a tea party for him at the International Hotel on the fourteenth floor at 5:00 PM. Mayor Wu, Liu Hongsheng, Yuan Fudeng, Lin Kanghou, Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi, Major General Sato, Major Oki, Consul Sugihara, Assessor Wakasugi, Secretary Di Yuan, Horiuchi, and Arino were invited to attend. The guests and hosts parted in high spirits at 7:00 PM. It is understood that Xu is scheduled to go to Nanjing on the 10th to see Foreign Minister Zhang and receive his credentials and complete the formalities for his departure. If time permits, he also plans to inspect the construction projects in Huangshan before returning to Nanjing in a week. The formal date of his departure to take office will be early next month.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Returned Visit to Departing Japanese Ambassador Yesterday</h3>
<p>To reciprocate the farewell visit made by Japanese Ambassador to China, Ariyoshi Akira, the day before, Mayor of Shanghai Wu Tiecheng, accompanied by Commissioner Wang Changchun, personally returned the visit at the Ambassador's residence on Rue Pichon at 10:30 yesterday morning. He also conveyed his regards and saw him off. They talked for about fifteen minutes before he took his leave.</p>

<h3>Post Office Mail Boat Hongxin Number Formally Received Yesterday - To Be Used Exclusively for Picking Up and Delivering Overseas Mail</h3>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency, the Shanghai Postal Administration ordered the mail boat Hongxin Number from the Jiangnan Shipyard at Gaochang Temple. After completion, it was formally received yesterday morning without any ceremony. The ship is now docked at the Bund, off the New Customs Wharf. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Ordering Process</h3>
<p>The sole purpose for the Shanghai Post Office's ordering of the mail boat was to transport overseas mail for loading and unloading from foreign ships. As foreign ships often docked outside the Wusong estuary, or along the Pudong and Yangshupu sections of the river, small boats were needed for loading and unloading. Postal Commissioner Zha Peilin, to facilitate the convenience of pickup and delivery, specially requested the General Administration to submit a request to the Ministry of Communications the year before last, entrusting the Jiangnan Shipyard to build the vessel. Now it has been completed.</p>
<h3>Received Yesterday</h3>
<p>The boat is one hundred feet long, eighteen feet wide, nine feet deep, and has a draft of seven feet. Its speed is one nautical mile every five minutes, with four hundred horsepower. Its speed is unmatched by any small boat in the Huangpu River. The boat had already undergone sea trials. The receiving procedure yesterday was very simple. Only inspectors from the Post Office's Engineering Supervisory Office were dispatched at 9:00 AM to inspect and accept it. It was then immediately sailed to the Bund, off the New Customs Wharf, where it is docked. It is scheduled to begin picking up and delivering overseas mail today without any ceremony.</p>
<h3>Local - Cause of the Weather Turning Cold - Cold Weather Not Due to Lower Temperature - Actually Due to the Stimulation of the Skin by Humidity and Strong Winds</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun, the weather in Shanghai has suddenly turned cold recently. The reason for this is believed to be the influence of the snowfall in Tokyo and Osaka. According to the meteorological observatory, Shanghai is far from the snowstorm zone and has no relationship to it. The recent cold weather is due to the high pressure from the south of Hankou gradually moving eastward. This high pressure is flowing towards Okinawa in the south of the East China Sea, and on the other hand, it is combining with the high pressure from Korea and Manchuria. The climate is gradually becoming gloomy, so various parts of China seem to have signs of snowfall. As for Shanghai turning cold, it is not caused by the temperature dropping, but by the relationship between humidity and strong winds stimulating the skin. However, it will gradually become warmer in a few days.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign Figures - Planning a Grand Exposition</h3>
<p>According to news from the local business community, Chinese and foreign figures in Shanghai are currently actively preparing for an unprecedented exposition. The venue has been decided to be on Yangshupu Road. All the construction is already underway. Preliminary construction can be completed within April. After internal arrangements are added, it is scheduled to open in early July. The exposition will include excellent works of industry, commerce, and culture. It is expected that many visitors will attend, so it is proposed to charge an admission fee of two dimes. All construction matters are currently being managed by a Westerner, Mr. Qian Bao Wei Er.</p>
<h3>Xinzha Detective Team - Solved a Bizarre Oil Theft Case - A Years-Long Mystery Solved in One Day - Iron Pipe Connected to the Underground of a Thatched Shed</h3>
<p>The Changji Oil Mill in Tanziwan, Panjiawan Road, Zhabei, has been operating for many years. In recent years, the oil produced by the mill has often suffered losses. At first, it was suspected that some workers in the factory were stealing. Therefore, the workers were replaced many times, but no one was ever seen stealing oil. Although the Tanziwan Police Station and the Xinzha Public Security Bureau Detective Team were notified, they were unable to solve the case. There are many thatched sheds behind the factory, mostly inhabited by workers who had stopped working at the factory or were still working there. The Xinzha Detective Team, in order to solve this bizarre case, ordered Squad Leaders Bao Ziying and Shi Zuhan to lead detectives Liu Changpei, Li Guiqing, Mao Gongzhao, Shi Zhanggui, Cai Jilin, Sun Youzhi, Zhu Jinrong, and Zhang Shuwen to disguise themselves and scout around the oil mill every day. They also made friends with the residents in the thatched sheds to avoid suspicion. It wasn't until about 2:00 PM yesterday that Detective Mao Gongzhao discovered the mechanism and reported back to the Xinzha Branch Bureau. Director Liao dispatched more than ten policemen including Zhu Tao to go together. As expected, an oil tank was found under the soil in the third thatched shed behind the oil mill. The tank could hold several dan of oil and was covered with a wooden lid. There was a hole on the side of the tank, and an iron pipe went straight into the ground, passing under the factory wall and reaching the bottom of the large oil tank from which oil was being extracted. Therefore, Fan Ronggui (also known as Fan San), 47 years old, from Zaoning; Xu Guohua, 40 years old, from Taizhou; Lu Ziming, 30 years old, from Jiading; Ma Jinchang, 26 years old, from Shandong; Wang Xiao Erzi, 18 years old, from Funing; Yu Zhixiang, 26 years old, from Baoying; Yang Shengfu, 36 years old, from Gaoyou; Yin Baocai, 66 years old, from Baoying; Yan Enfan, 39 years old, from Funing; Yin Xiaokouzi, 19 years old, from Baoying; Peng Wenxiu, 45 years old, from Rugao; Xu Zhuanggua, 31 years old, from Funing; Ma Zhangshi, a woman, 32 years old, from Yancheng; and Zhang Chenshi, a woman, 34 years old, from Huaian, a total of fourteen men and women living in the thatched shed, were taken to the team. According to Fan Ronggui and Xu Guohua, the theft mechanism was set up by Wu Asan and Ma A'er, who worked at the factory. Now, both of them have fled and their whereabouts are unknown. They asked us to help, and so on. Currently, the case is under investigation. It is understood that the factory, considering the importance of the case, has called a photo studio to take pictures of the oil theft mechanism for use in litigation.</p>

<h3>Three Youths Going Abroad - Passport Problem - Passport Genuine but Photo Impression Mismatch</h3>
<p>Zhu Chongyuan, Zhang Chongting, and Chen Bangyan, three young men from Wenzhou, Zhejiang, recently planned to go overseas to Austria to work and make a living. They obtained passports issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government to depart from Shanghai. Because they had to pass through France, they entrusted a fellow townsman to take them to the French Consulate General on the afternoon of the day before yesterday to request visa endorsements. After inspection by the French Consulate, it was found that although the passports were genuine, the name and photo impression on the passport were inconsistent. It was suspected that the passport holders were impersonating others, so the French Concession police were notified and detectives were dispatched to take Zhu, Zhang, and Chen to investigate. According to Zhu and others, the passports were handled by the owner of a hostel in Nanshi. Yesterday, Zhu and others were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court, where they were interrogated by Judge Chen Pusheng. A lawyer from the Police Department stated that the defendants were suspected of forging official documents and requested a postponement of the investigation before filing a complaint. After reviewing the case, the court briefly interrogated the defendants and ordered a rescheduling of the hearing for ten days.</p>
<h3>Massive Salmon Embezzlement Case - Account Books Difficult to Clear - No Debate Yesterday After Interrogation - Defendants Released on Original Bail</h3>
<p>The local salted fish merchants Ye Zhenchang, Weng Zhaofang, Zheng Yunsheng, Zhang Benhua, and Ye Zhenqin were reported to the Procuratorate of the District Court last autumn by Zhu Xusheng, Zhao Lianfang, Chang Junfa, and others, stating that Ye and others had embezzled up to six thousand seven hundred dan of salmon shipped from Soviet Russia through fraudulent means, worth more than seventy thousand dollars. Zhu Xusheng and others believed that theft was a minor matter, but obstructing national tax revenue was a major matter. They were deeply afraid that once the incident was exposed, they would be jointly suspected, so they came forward and confessed. After Prosecutor Xiao investigated and confirmed the facts, he ordered Ye and others to be released on bail and filed a public prosecution under Article 339, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code. Judge Wu Deying has held several hearings. The informers demonstrated the embezzlement in court, realistically depicting the situation. Judge Wu also ordered Ye Zhenchang to submit the account books to the court for verification. This has been reported in previous newspapers. At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, Judge Wu came to the Third Criminal Court again for a continued hearing. First, Ye Zhenchang stated that there were a total of eighty-one thousand boxes of salmon, and only more than eight thousand boxes had no certificates. The official said, "This court has verified the account books for several days and found them to be inconsistent. How do you respond to the accusations of fraud by the informers Zhu Xusheng and others?" Ye replied, "I did not commit any fraud." Next, Weng Zhaofang stated that he worked at the Jieshun Salted Fish Shop on Waixian Gua Street. When asked, "Are you the manager?" he replied, "No, I am a salesman." Then, witness Xu Runsheng came to court to testify. He was 41 years old, from Ningbo, and the manager of the Xieyuan Fruit Shop on Dongmen Road. He did not know Zhu Xusheng and others, and only had a relative relationship with Zheng Yunsheng. The official said, "You are a witness and should tell the truth. If you tell a lie, you will be held criminally liable." Xu replied, "Of course I will tell the truth." The official asked, "Does the Fish Shop Association have a book in your possession?" He replied, "No, we are a fruit shop and have nothing to do with the salted fish shop." Finally, Chang Junfa stated that Ye Zhenqin and others ordered him to instruct the workers to commit fraud, and the wage was one dollar per person. If the court does not believe it, it can investigate the police station of Yangjiadu Third District First Precinct. There is a case to be examined. At that time, because the Westerners of the Meadon Yoko discovered that the workers were not loosening the ropes, they beat the workers and filed a counter-complaint to the police station. As a result, Ye Zhenqin was fined 15 dollars by the police station and paid more than 30 dollars for the Westerners' straw hats, and so on. The interrogating official said that the account books submitted by the defendants were not easy to clear up for a while, so he announced that the debate would not be held today and would continue to be heard later. All defendants were released on original bail.</p>
<h3>Farmer Sues Local Leader - Accuses Him of Occupying His Wife and Falsely Accusing Him of Theft - Court Summonsed Defendant Yesterday, But He Did Not Arrive</h3>
<p>Zhou Miaogen, a farmer from Caohijing, Southwest Village, recently filed a lawsuit with the Procuratorate of the District Court, accusing Zhou Weisheng, who lives in Qujiaqiao and serves as a local leader, of enticing and raping his wife and falsely accusing him of theft. His statement said that the defendant, Zhou Weisheng, seeing that the plaintiff was ignorant and could be deceived, used all kinds of tricks to entice the plaintiff's wife, Zhang Yuefang, into adultery. He was not satisfied and abducted and fled with the plaintiff's wife in October of last year. Later, it was discovered that the defendant was hiding the plaintiff's wife at home as a concubine, acting like husband and wife. The matter was reported to the police station in charge and the police took the plaintiff's wife back. Unexpectedly, the defendant had sinister intentions and falsely accused the plaintiff of theft to the Caohijing Police Station in December of the old lunar calendar. Fortunately, the entire town was in an uproar and expressed their indignation. The police station presented everything and the plaintiff was spared from disaster, otherwise he would have been a wronged ghost long ago. Just as he was preparing to file a lawsuit to redress his grievances, the defendant learned about it and asked Village Elder Zhang Mingxiang to meet the plaintiff at the Village Elder's house on the fifth day of the first lunar month to settle the matter by paying the plaintiff 205 yuan. The plaintiff refused. The defendant is a local leader and has a reputation as a wolf and tiger in the village. He usually acts recklessly in the village and does all kinds of evil. Now that the defendant has both committed adultery with and occupied the plaintiff's wife and falsely accused the plaintiff of theft, it is a matter of using his power and defying the law. Therefore, he filed a special lawsuit, pleading for the arrest of the defendant Zhou Weisheng and the plaintiff's wife, Zhang Yuefang, for strict investigation, etc. After the court received the complaint, Prosecutor Zhao Chuanjia summoned them for interrogation yesterday. Because the defendant Zhou Weisheng and Zhang Yuefang did not arrive, Zhou Miaogen was ordered to leave and await instructions.</p>
<h3>Convicted of Cohabiting with a Prostitute - Zhuang Jimeng Appeals - Interrogation Concluded Yesterday, Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>Zhuang Jimeng, the owner of the Zhuangyuan Datsao workshop in Hongkou, had previously become acquainted with the famous prostitute Lao Jiu (also known as Feng Minghua) and cohabited with her at No. 27 Duofu Lane, Foch Road. This was discovered by Zhuang's wife, Zhang Yuexing, who reported it to the police, who arrested Zhuang and Feng together. They were sent to the Special No. 1 Court for trial and sentenced Zhuang and Feng to three months' imprisonment each, each suspended for three years. Zhuang and Feng refused to accept the judgment and hired lawyers such as Yu Xiangqin to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court, requesting the revocation of the original judgment and the declaration of innocence. Their reason was that Zhuang and Feng's cohabitation was based on a determination to grow old together and met the requirements of Article 9 of the Implementing Rules of the Criminal Code, and the penalties of Article 239 of the Criminal Code did not apply. Moreover, the law does not apply retroactively. Article 1 of the Criminal Code stipulates that the punishment of an act is limited to the explicit provisions of the law at the time of the act. The appellants' actions were before the implementation of the Criminal Code and should be listed as unpunishable, etc. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu Hua of the Second Branch of the High Court, accompanied by Judges Zhao and Zhou and Prosecutor Lin, took their seats in the First Criminal Court for interrogation. Gan Jingxian, a lawyer from the police station, also appeared in court. After Judge Yu investigated, he ordered a debate and then announced the conclusion, scheduling the pronouncement of judgment for a later date.</p>
<h3>Abusing a Maid's Daughter - Liu Zhengshi's Violent Nature - Mother and Daughter Both Released on Bail</h3>
<p>Liu Zhengshi, a Cantonese woman, 43 years old, residing at No. 68 Fengyu Lane, Rue Saussier, French Concession, lives with her elderly mother, Mrs. Mei (63 years old). Mrs. Mei used to employ a maid, a certain Mrs. (surname unknown). The maid had worked as a domestic worker in other locations and sent her five-year-old daughter (name unknown) to her former employer, Mrs. Mei, for fostering, paying a small amount for food. Unexpectedly, Liu Zhengshi was naturally violent and often abused and whipped the child, causing the girl to suddenly fall ill. Zhengshi sent the girl to Guangci Hospital for treatment a few days ago. After the doctor examined the girl, she found many scars on her body. After learning that she had been beaten by the daughter of the employer, the hospital reported it to the French police. The police dispatched detectives to investigate and confirmed the facts. Liu Zhengshi and her mother, Mrs. Mei, were arrested together and sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court the day before yesterday. Judge Sun Pengxian presided over the interrogation. Yuan Jiahuang, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated the facts of the case and said that the victimized girl was currently being treated at Guangci Hospital and would need two weeks to recover and be discharged. He requested a postponement of the trial. After reviewing the case, the court briefly interrogated the defendants and ordered a rescheduling of the hearing for the upper half of the 19th. The two defendants were each ordered to provide a store bond of 300 yuan pending trial. Subsequently, their defense lawyer requested that they be temporarily released on bond and then provide a bail bond. The court approved it and the defendants were taken out by their lawyer.</p>
<h3>Two Western Police Detectives Accused of Murder - Interrogation of Witnesses for Five Hours - Chauffeur Steadfastly Maintains He Witnessed the Incident</h3>
<p>The trial of Western police detectives Peter and trainee detective Geute of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, accused of intentionally killing Hua, Ma Debiao, continued at the British Court in China the other afternoon. The chauffeur, Du, who drove the two defendants to Xinjihama Road to inspect Ma Debiao, claimed to have witnessed the two defendants throwing Ma into the Hongkou River. He was questioned by the defendants' lawyer and the prosecutor for five hours, which made Du feel very uncomfortable. He had to leave the court for a few minutes to rest. The translator also found it very difficult and had to be replaced. The court adjourned at 6:15 PM. Although the lawyer subjected Du to various interrogations, he remained steadfast and firmly stated that he had witnessed the two defendants throwing Ma into the river, without being intimidated in the slightest. The court resumed yesterday morning. Du was questioned again for two hours. Finally, the foreman of the jury, Mr. Spicer, asked him a few questions. He asked what clothes the beggar was wearing. He replied that he had not paid attention and could not say. He asked what the beggar was wearing on his feet. He replied that he had not paid attention to it either. He asked if he could distinguish the sound of a person falling into the water from the sound of other heavy objects falling into the water. He replied that when a person falls into the water, there is naturally a sound. He asked if he had heard any other sounds besides the sound of the beggar falling into the water. He replied that he had only heard the sound of water. After Du finished giving his testimony, Shen, a vegetable vendor, was called. Shen said that he discovered a person trapped in the river. Before he rescued him, he saw two foreigners in strict uniforms driving car number 8502 past his house. Shen was later questioned by Royal Counsel Plaeswood for a long time. A total of 27 witnesses must be called in this case. Shen was the ninth witness to be questioned.</p>
<h3>Health Bureau Warns Citizens - Prevent Spring Epidemics</h3>
<p>As winter passes and spring comes, the temperature changes greatly. Many infectious diseases often spread at this time. According to the Municipal Health Bureau's announcement this morning, these infectious diseases are mostly epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, smallpox, measles, and the like. They spread very quickly and are very dangerous, especially for children. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency has learned the general details of the transmission routes, symptoms, and prevention methods of each disease, and hereby records them as follows, so that everyone will know how to prevent them.</p>
<p>Epidemic Cerebrospinal Meningitis - This disease is caused by meningococcal bacteria. The transmission route is mostly from the tonsils of the nose or throat. Trauma to the skull or mental excitement and overwork can also lead to transmission. The incubation period is several days to three or four days. The symptoms often appear suddenly, first with severe chills, followed by fever, often reaching about 40 degrees. The headache is very severe and often accompanied by vomiting. Sensation is overly sensitive. As the disease progresses, symptoms of opisthotonos appear. Those suffering from this disease are mostly in danger of death and should be sent to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible. Do not delay.</p>
<p>Smallpox - The pathogen of this disease has not yet been fully determined. The virus is often present in the contents of the pustules, so even if the pus has dried into a scab, the infectious power remains undiminished. Even in the incubation period and early stages, it can be transmitted to others. The transmission route is mostly through the respiratory system and mucous membranes, invading the human body. The incubation period is about 10 to 14 days. The symptoms begin with chills and shivering, and the body temperature rises suddenly, sometimes reaching more than 40 degrees. On the third to sixth day after the onset, smallpox appears on various parts of the body. At this time, the temperature drops, and it rises again when the pustules suppurate. Those suffering from this disease will leave scars and become ugly in mild cases, and will die in severe cases. The only way to prevent this disease is to vaccinate against it. If someone in a family has this disease, isolate them immediately. All other people should be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Measles - The cause of this disease is also not yet clear, but it is known that humans are almost all susceptible. The virus is often contained in the blood, tears, nose, throat, and secretions of the trachea. The transmission medium is mostly warm air and contact with patients or objects contaminated with the virus. The incubation period is about 10 days. Within the first three or four days, rhinitis and conjunctivitis appear, so there is often a runny nose and tearing. Later, a high fever develops, reaching about 40 degrees. White spots the size of hatpins appear on the oral mucosa. These are called Koplik's spots. After the fourth day, measles appear. The location of occurrence is mostly fixed, starting from the cheeks, spreading to the face, and then down, eventually reaching the whole body. This disease often causes death due to complications. Those suffering from this disease should be treated in the hospital and isolated.</p>
<h3>Gangster Internal Strife: The Truth Behind Mutual Killing</h3>
<h3>Accusations of Uneven Distribution of Stolen Goods Lead to Resentment and Gang Killing; Criminals Chen Bishu and Five Others Attempt to Evade Responsibility</h3>
<p>Last month, on the night of the 9th, in the gangster den at No. 63 Tong'an Lane, Maitland Road, western Shanghai, internal strife broke out among the bandits, resulting in mutual killing. The bandit Lü Zhenming was killed on the spot by gunfire, while Yang Bangjie was wounded. Subsequently, the Gordon Road police successively arrested 18 male and female bandits. After investigation, two of them were found to be innocent and released. The remaining sixteen, including Lü Zhenming's wife, Lü Chen, Yang Bangjie, Yang's wife Yang Jin, Chen Dekuan, Qian Liu, Chen Liu, Hu Zuting, Chen Dehong, Qi Zhang, Liu Huaizhen, Qian Jinshan, Chen Bishu, Qi Buyou, Zhou Buyun, Miao Diankui, and Tang Wang, were detained for further investigation. This was previously reported. Investigation by the handling detectives has now revealed that these individuals committed a robbery</p>
<p>in the French Concession,</p>
<p>stealing more than six thousand yuan. Recently, on December 12th of last year, they kidnapped a fourteen-year-old boy, Weng Jinchun, on Liaoyang Road in the Public Concession. The boy's family later paid a ransom of 50,000 yuan for his release. The current internal strife was caused by the uneven distribution of the stolen goods. In addition to charges of kidnapping for ransom, the police have also charged Chen Bishu, Qian Jinshan, Qi Buyou, Zhou Buyun, Miao Diankui, and Tang Wang with the crimes of killing Lü Zhenming and injuring Yang Bangjie. Yesterday afternoon, all the criminals were escorted to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Liu Yugui presided over the court session and ordered the six male and female defendants accused of murder, including Chen Bishu, to be brought forward for interrogation. Zhang Tianyin, the prosecuting attorney for the police, then presented the defendants'</p>
<p>murder process</p>
<p>and the facts, stating that the motive for the killing of Lü and Yang was twofold: first, Lü and Yang had not received any of the 6,000 yuan stolen in the French Concession. They repeatedly demanded it from Qian Jinshan and the fugitive Chen Daweizi. Qian and Chen greatly resented this. Second, Lü and Yang threatened to report the kidnapping on Liaoyang Road if they did not receive a share. Qian and Chen heard of this and decided to strike first. On the evening of January 9th, they carried out the killings. On January 8th, Chen Bishu and Qian Jinshan went to the Shuanglongyuan teahouse opened by Miao Diankui in Zhabei to discuss the matter with Chen Daweizi and others. It was decided that Miao would borrow two pistols from Zhou Buyun's boathouse on the Binjiang Road, and that all family members living near Lü and Yang would be moved to Route Cardinal Foch to avoid</p>
<p>entangling family members</p>
<p>and making escape difficult after the killings. On the afternoon of the 9th, after 7 p.m., the killers gradually gathered at the entrance of Tong'an Lane. First, Chen Daweizi burst into Yang's home to check. Yang and Lü were both present. Chen immediately withdrew and ordered Chen Bishu and the fugitive Wang Ganlin to enter and monitor Yang and Lü. Qian Jinshan, Chen Daweizi, and a person named Dai then rushed in. Qian and Chen each held a pistol and fired continuously. Lü was shot and killed on the spot. Although Yang was injured, he tried to resist, but Chen Bishu restrained him, allowing the others to escape. The pistols borrowed from Zhou were temporarily hidden at Tang Wang's residence on Gordon Road that day. Later, Qi Buyou returned them to Zhou, who</p>
<p>placed them in the river.</p>
<p>It was only when Zhou was detained that they were recovered, etc. Subsequently, firearms experts from the Public Works Department confirmed that Lü's death and Yang's injury were indeed caused by these two guns. The court then interrogated the six defendants, including Chen Bishu, one by one in isolation. However, Chen persistently denied everything, claiming ignorance of all points regarding the prior planning and the temporary killings. The court then ordered that Lü Chen, the wife of the deceased Lü Zhenming, be brought forward for cross-examination. She testified that the killings were indeed caused by uneven distribution of stolen goods and that Chen Bishu was indeed present at the scene of the shooting. The other defendants also gave evasive answers. As it was late, the court ordered that the defendants be returned to custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Accused of Conspiring in a Robbery</h3>
<h3>Also Accused of Obstructing Freedom and Immoral Conduct; Accomplices Also Arrested and Detained for Further Questioning</h3>
<p>Shen Sanjiang, a 32-year-old rickshaw puller from Haimen, Jiangbei, residing at No. 21, Lane 676, Route Tenant de la Tour, has a mistress, Yang Huiying, a 23-year-old woman from Pudong, residing at No. 72, Route Lafayette, French Concession. On January 20th, at 11 p.m., Yang Huiying was suddenly robbed of a gold bracelet worth 50 yuan from Qingtianbao Jewelry store that she was wearing on her wrist in Lane 64, Route Lafayette. Yang immediately reported the robbery to the French police and requested an investigation. On the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, at 1 p.m., Shen, in collusion with Lu Ahu (35 years old) from Pudong, rushed to his mistress's home and accused Tang Asi (female, 24 years old), Chen Meifang (female, 29 years old), and Jin Xiaomei (female, 32 years old), all from Pudong and cohabiting with Yang, of conspiring to rob his mistress Yang Huiying of her gold bracelet. He threatened Tang, Chen, and Jin, demanding that they jointly compensate the bracelet's value of 50 yuan, or else he would not let them off. Lu Ahu, who had come along, tried to mediate and pretended to persuade them, guaranteeing that the three women would pay the money at 4 p.m. on the 5th before leaving. At the appointed time, Shen again invited Lu to the teahouse at No. 171, Rue des Mares and sent someone to call Tang, Chen, and Jin to bring the money. Because Tang and the others ignored him, Shen reported to the French police, requesting their detention. The head of the police station sent detective Yao Xuerong to bring Tang, Chen, and Jin in for questioning. The three women not only denied conspiring in the robbery, but Jin Xiaomei counter-reported that Shen Sanjiang had come to her at 1 p.m. on the 3rd and taken her to a room in the New World Hotel, where he confined and raped her twice. She also stated that regarding the robbery of Yang Huiying's gold bracelet, he accused her of ordering someone to rob it, demanding that she reveal who did it. She was only released to go home at 5 p.m. the next day and requested a strict investigation. Tang and Chen reported that Shen Sanjiang and Lu Ahu had falsely accused them of conspiring in the robbery and threatened and extorted them, requesting a thorough investigation of the false accusation. Based on this, the head of the police station questioned Shen, who was left speechless. The head of the police station, believing that Shen had committed acts of false accusation of conspiracy to rob, obstruction of freedom, and indecency, sent detective Yao to arrest Lu Ahu as well, placing them all in custody. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Criminal Division 1 of the Second Special Court. Court President Wang Gangxu interrogated them. Fee Si Zhen, the attorney for the police station, presented the case, requesting a postponement of the investigation before filing charges. Subsequently, the complainants Tang Asi, Chen Meifang, and Jin Xiaomei testified to the defendants' extortion and illegal confinement and rape. The court questioned the two defendants. Shen denied the illegal confinement and rape, while Lu gave evasive answers. The court ordered that the defendants be returned to custody for further questioning on the 13th.</p>
<h3>Woman Has Miscarriage After Taking Medicine; Doctor Accused; Trial Concludes;</h3>
<h3>"Residence During Menses" Meant to Imply Pregnancy; Examination of Prescription Shows No Discrepancies</h3>
<p>Ms. Zhu, the wife of Xu Yizeng, manager of the Hongyun Photo Studio at the entrance of Punting Lane, Nanjing Road, had been four months pregnant and experiencing spotting. Therefore, on November 19th and 21st of last year, she twice went to consult Yu Zuotang, a female physician from Ningbo, at No. 72 Guanbao Lane, Xiangfen Lane. Yu diagnosed her condition as "residence during menses," leading to increased bleeding after taking the medication. On the 23rd, she announced a miscarriage. Xu then hired attorneys Shen Zongyong and Wang Shouan to accuse Yu of abortion and negligent injury at the First Special Court. These circumstances have already been tried twice and reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang opened the Criminal Division 2 court for continued questioning. He announced the assessment of the National Medical Branch, stating that, according to the assessment report, the defendant's prescription was not inappropriate. He then questioned Xu Yizeng about the circumstances, implying pregnancy and not irregular menstruation. Judge Jiang then stated that there were other terms to clarify pregnancy, why be specific with the phrase "residence during menses?" Furthermore, your prescription has several ingredients, and contains ingredients to release the exterior, Yu replied that the plaintiff's wife was also suffering from headaches, and thus the exterior release agents were added. The court believed that the facts were clear, and ordered the beginning of the debate. The plaintiff's lawyer and the defendant's lawyer, Xie Guofang, debated, and the court announced the conclusion, and scheduled sentencing for next Thursday.</p>

<h3>Shanghai County Sends Personnel</h3>
<h3>To Handle Re-measurement and Registration in Chenxing and Other Areas</h3>
<p>Xing Zhigang, the fifth district head of Shanghai County, to start re-measurement and registration of land in his district and to establish a temporary registration office, received a public letter from the county land bureau yesterday as follows, "An investigation of the request for re-measurement and establishment of boundaries by Ni Shuxiang and 279 other households in the three townships of Chenxing, Tangkou, and Tiqiao has been completed by personnel sent by this bureau for on-site re-measurement. All re-measurement results have now been sorted out, totaling 160 cases of neighbor number corrections and 246 cases of new land numbers. As the number of re-measurement requests in your district is large and it is inconvenient for property owners to come to the bureau to register due to the long distance, this bureau, to alleviate the hardship of the people, will set up a temporary registration office in your district office. On the 20th of this month, personnel will be sent to handle re-measurement registration matters. The Chenxing and other three township re-measurement result notification letters and lists, as well as the scheduled registration date table, are hereby sent to your district head for review. Please instruct the township chiefs to inform each village chief and local guarantor to distribute them to each property owner and order them to go to the designated location within the specified time limit to apply for registration in accordance with the law. Do not delay," etc.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department</h3>
<h3>Pan Mingxun, Comprador of the PWD, Celebrates 50th Anniversary of Service</h3>
<h3>Board of Directors Holds Celebration</h3>
<p>Mr. Pan Mingxun, comprador of the Public Works Department, is originally from Nanhai, Guangdong. His family has lived in Shanghai for more than a century. Mr. Pan joined the Public Works Department at a young age and is known among his peers for his loyalty, diligence, competence, and integrity. His moral character and enthusiasm are especially admired by his colleagues. Mr. Pan has served in the Public Works Department for 50 years as of January 10 of this year. It is rare, if not unprecedented, to dedicate half a century to serving in one organization, demonstrating unwavering loyalty and perseverance. Therefore, the entire Board of Directors of the Public Works Department held a solemn celebration during a regular meeting a few days ago to express their admiration and mark this unprecedented achievement. The directors present that day included Chairman Arnold, Directors Landmark, Craney, Franklin, Hsi Yuk-shu, Hsu Hsin-liu, Chiang I-ping, Keiller, Little, Board, Occupation, Yamamoto, and Chinese directors Guo Shun and Yu Qiaqing, who were temporarily absent due to business. Key officials from the Bureau who attended the celebration included Director-General Fessenden, Secretary-General Johnson, and Head of the Finance Department Ford. The Chairman spoke, saying that at the Board of Directors meeting on January 8, he had reminded the directors that Mr. Pan, the bureau's comprador, would be celebrating his 50th anniversary of service on the 10th of that month. Mr. Pan's service has been consistently loyal and commendable. The Board of Directors, to express its admiration and set an example, should present him with a suitable gift to commemorate the occasion. The Board of Directors unanimously approved the motion. Therefore, today, I, as the representative of the entire Board of Directors, present Mr. Pan Mingxun with a clock engraved with the record of the event as a permanent memento. The directors then congratulated Mr. Pan, who humbly thanked them one by one. Afterwards, Arnold briefly recounted the beginning and end of Mr. Pan's service in the Bureau, saying that today's celebration is not only a commemoration of Mr. Pan's 50th year of public service but also a celebration of the Pan family's relationship with the Bureau for more than 75 years. A report of Public Works Department in 1886 contained a memorial of the death of Mr. Pan Yuming, which stated, "Mr. Yuming served in the Bureau for more than 25 years. He was diligent in his work and highly regarded by his colleagues." Because of Mr. Yuming's meritorious service, after his death, his son, Mr. Juxuan, succeeded him as the comprador of the Public Works Department. Mr. Juxuan retired in 1930, when he was 71 years old, having served in the Bureau for 48 years. Therefore, at a meeting of the Board of Directors on June 11 of that year, the Chairman, on behalf of the entire Board of Directors, presented Mr. Juxuan with a gold plate engraved with the record of the event as a memento. In his speech, he praised Mr. Juxuan's selfless spirit and his significant contributions to the harmony between Chinese and foreign residents in Shanghai. After Mr. Juxuan's retirement, his younger brother, Mr. Mingxun, succeeded him as the comprador, who is the subject of today's 50th anniversary celebration. Mr. Mingxun is 68 years old this year. Although his hair is white, he is energetic and healthier than a young man. He comes to the Bureau to work every day, regardless of the weather. It is truly a sign of longevity. It is expected that he will continue to serve in the future and that the relationship between the Pan family and the Bureau will continue indefinitely. There are also Pan family members working in the General Accounting Office of the Public Works Department, including Pan Shiju, the son of Mr. Juxuan, and Pan Shiqi and Shishen, the sons of Mr. Mingxun. It is also heard that Mr. Pan Jingshan, the clan elder of Mr. Mingxun, was also the comprador of the Public Works Department more than 75 years ago. Therefore, although there are no detailed records of this, it is not an exaggeration to say that since the establishment of the Public Works Department on the banks of the Huangpu River, the position of comprador has been held by the Pan family, generation after generation. In this changing world, the titles of the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department have been changed countless times over the past century, and the personnel changes in the offices of the Secretary-General and the Finance Department have also been countless times, but the relationship between the Pan family and the Bureau has been maintained continuously. This is truly a good story of Spring and Autumn.</p>

<h3>Ningbo Native Association</h3>
<h3>Writes to Four Companies, Urging Them to Cancel Fare Increase on Shanghai-Ningbo Route</h3>
<h3>Increasing Shipping Costs is a Suicidal Policy; Reducing Shipping Costs to Revive Commerce</h3>
<p>According to Shenshi News Agency, the Taikoo, Sanbei, Ningshao, China Merchants, and other shipping companies that operate on the Shanghai-Ningbo route with ships such as the Xinjiangtian, citing the recent increase in the price of coal, metals, and other materials and the increased expenditure, uniformly increased fares by 20% on the 1st of this month to maintain the status quo. After the public announcement in the newspapers, Ningbo businesses, citing the depression and sluggish business, asked how they could bear the increased burden and requested the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce to ask the Shanghai Ningbo Native Association to negotiate with the Taikoo and other companies to cancel the 20% fare increase to maintain cargo transport. The association, upon learning of the situation, sent letters to the Shanghai Taikoo Company, the Ningshao Company, the Sanbei Company, and the China Merchants Bureau yesterday. The original letter stated, "Regarding the letter from the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce stating, 'Regarding the letter from the Yinxian Silk and Cloth Industry Association stating, recently, members of our association have come to the association to state that, according to reports, the Xinjiangtian and other four ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route have increased cargo transport fares by 20% from February 1st. We are shocked to read this. Ningbo is a transshipment port. Affected by the sluggish market in recent years, business has declined to the extreme. In addition, last year's financial turmoil shook the ponds, and credit was extremely tight. The state of real buying has become even more stagnant. Businesses have declared bankruptcy one after another due to sluggish business and poor circulation, which is an undeniable fact. Now, although they are still struggling to maintain the status quo, they may not be able to maintain it for long. The four shipping companies should understand the business situation and reduce shipping costs to seek the revival of the Ningbo market, but they have not done so. Instead, they have proposed to increase shipping costs. Members cannot approve of it. Please ask your association to ask the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce to ask the companies to cancel the fare increase immediately to maintain business, etc.' Based on this, the decline in commerce and the depletion of finance, it is already difficult for each industry to maintain the status quo, and it seems inappropriate to increase shipping costs suddenly. According to the aforementioned situation, we hereby request your association to quickly forward a letter to the Ningbo China Merchants Bureau, Ningshao, Sanbei, Taikoo, and other four shipping companies to cancel the fare increase immediately to maintain business and hope to see a reply, etc. Because of the decline in Ningbo in recent years and the depletion of finance, it is already difficult to maintain the status quo. If shipping costs are increased, cargo transport will inevitably stagnate, resulting in a lose-lose situation. We hope that the government will understand the business situation and cancel the fare increase immediately to maintain business and benefit cargo transport, etc., and send letters to the Ningbo China Merchants Bureau and other four shipping companies for review and reply. While the matter was being handled, the Qin County Customs Broker Association also sent a letter with the same content, stating that the matter of increasing cargo costs is directly related to the industries in this port and requested that letters be sent to each trade association for notification. It was also submitted to the fifth meeting of the Executive Committee on February 1 for detailed discussion. It was unanimously agreed that, according to the report, the four shipping companies' announcement stated that the reason for the increase in cargo costs was the increase in the price of coal, metals, and other materials and the increased expenditure of the ships. However, in recent years, the price of coal has been decreasing day by day. Recently, the best coal has been reduced by 60% compared to before January 28. As for metal materials, they were originally necessary for repairs, but each company only repairs ships once a year, and even if there are ups and downs, it is irrelevant to the overall situation. To point to increased expenditure is not in accordance with the facts." In addition, Ningbo is a transshipment port. Since the opening of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, merchants from Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou have mostly purchased goods directly from Shanghai. Ningbo cargo transport has already been hit. With the opening of the Hangzhou-Jiangxi Railway, the sales areas of Jinhua, Quzhou, and Yanping were also seized. Ningbo's commerce is declining like a river going downhill, and there is no way to save it. The shipping companies, at this time of declining cargo transport, did not think of ways to attract it. Instead, they wanted to increase shipping costs to compensate for it, which is the same as scaring away fish in the deep or scaring away birds in the industry. If each industry has no profit to be made, it will not be willing to transport it. If each shipping company goes back and forth between Shanghai and Ningbo, cargo transport is its lifeblood. If cargo transport disappears, it may not be able to maintain the status quo and all will die together. It is painful to say. Commentators point to the decision of the four shipping companies to increase shipping costs as a suicidal policy. It is certainly not an excessive statement. However, the proposal to increase shipping costs was decided by the Shanghai four shipping companies' headquarters, and the Ningbo branch companies cannot solve it. It is proposed that the Shanghai Native Association negotiate nearby and find a way to cancel it to maintain business. It was decided that a statement of reasons should be sent to the Shanghai Native Association to negotiate with the four shipping companies nearby as soon as possible to cancel the proposal to increase shipping costs to maintain business and send letters to the Ningbo four shipping companies for review, etc., and unanimously passed and recorded. In addition to sending letters, we hereby record the case and send it to your association for review. We hope that you will negotiate with the four shipping companies' headquarters nearby as soon as possible to cancel the proposal to increase shipping costs to benefit cargo transport and maintain the status quo. We sincerely hope to see a reply. Therefore, we specially copy the original letter and send it to you. We hope that you will take note of the cancellation of the fare increase to maintain cargo transport and ensure the status quo. We are deeply grateful and hope to see a reply.</p>

<h3>Sets Work Outline and Implements it in Stages</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal National Products Year Movement Committee has submitted a request to the municipal party and government agencies, requesting that all staff members uniformly use domestic products to promote them, and has formulated a work outline for implementation in stages. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Civil Servants Asked to Use Domestic Products The Shanghai Municipal National Products Year Committee submitted a request to the municipal party and government agencies yesterday, "For submitting a request to instruct civil servants to uniformly use domestic products to promote them. This year is the officially designated Municipal National Products Year. If we want to stimulate all citizens to uniformly use domestic products, it will not be effective without the promotion of civil servants first. In order to arouse all sectors to work hard to promote domestic products, the second meeting of the council of directors resolved that all staff members of this association, starting from today, should use domestic products for all daily necessities and clothing. In addition, we are submitting a request to the party and government agencies to instruct all civil servants to purchase domestic products to promote them. We hereby submit this request for review and approval, and we hope that it will be adopted and implemented."</p>

<h3>General Situation of the Public Concession Volunteer Corps Last Year</h3>
<p>British and American youths are gradually declining; reserve plans are difficult to implement; the Russian unit's strength is noteworthy.</p>
<p>According to the 1935 report of the Shanghai Municipal Council Volunteer Corps, the most noteworthy issue currently facing the corps is the problem of replenishing new recruits. The number of Volunteer Corps members in the concession is approximately between 1,950 and 2,100. Previously, the number of veterans retiring annually and new recruits joining generally offset each other, so the total number could be maintained. In the spring of this year, the corps planned to establish reserve units in each unit. Personnel indispensable to major commercial firms would be assigned to the reserve units during mobilization. Because these reserve unit soldiers are important employees of commercial firms, they would not be lightly mobilized except in the final emergency or when temporarily replacing other non-essential employees. However, after these important employees are assigned to the reserve units, their original vacancies must be filled by recruiting new soldiers. Last year, the Chairman of the Municipal Council sent a letter to various British and American commercial firms in the port, requesting their support. Subsequently, commercial firms from other countries in the area also received these letters. The responses from the commercial firms were very satisfactory, but the number of new recruits was small, making it impossible to implement the plan to establish reserve units. Fortunately, since the issuance of this request, the corps has been able to prepare a list of important employees. This list is constantly being updated and can be used as a basis for reassigning personnel during mobilization.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the age problem is also extremely difficult. Even considering the special police and the British and American members of the corps, it is evident that the number of youths of suitable age in the port who can join the Volunteer Corps is very limited. Moreover, the number of foreign employees in various commercial firms has been reduced, and those laid off are mostly younger. The number of young Westerners coming to Shanghai is also declining. If the current number of corps members can be maintained, the duties will not be abandoned. However, the soldiers in the British and American units cannot be said to be all young. Therefore, it is predicted that if young recruits cannot come in a steady stream, the old soldiers in the corps will eventually become old, lose their previous interest in the Volunteer Corps, and apply for retirement. The ranks will become empty. This phenomenon is expected to occur around 1939. The solution lies in the restoration of the market and the continuous arrival of foreign youths. Therefore, the current authorities in charge of the Volunteer Corps are unwilling to mobilize all corps members to the front lines during mobilization and are unable to abandon their cautious attitude when recruiting older new soldiers.</p>
<p>Among the Volunteer Corps, only the Russian unit has no difficulty in recruiting, and there are often surplus people waiting to be filled. Officers can select from them, and those who come to apply are generally strong and their level of knowledge has improved compared to before. If necessary, recruiting another battalion would not be difficult. According to the report of the Russian unit officers, the Russian unit in the corps is the first line of reserves for the Public Concession Police Force. Its organization includes a battalion headquarters managing three companies of soldiers, plus a company of volunteer soldiers, forming a "Class C Battalion." This type of Russian Volunteer Corps is a powerful defensive weapon in the port and can be rapidly deployed at any time. Except for large-scale internal disturbances or external invasions, mobilizing the Russian infantry unit can eliminate the need for full mobilization of the Volunteer Corps, and the port's commerce will not be interrupted. Even in times of peace, the unit's duties are very numerous. For example, when important figures from various countries arrive in or depart from Shanghai, the Volunteer Corps' Russian unit provides the honor guard. Other places such as the Ward Road Gaol, the Rifle Range, and the Edinburgh Road Barracks are also guarded by the Volunteer Corps' Russian unit.</p>
<p>Regarding training, several field exercises were held this year in Hongkou Park and quiet streets. Routine exercises focused on riot control. The annual shooting competition was very disciplined and the results were above average. Due to the cooperative guidance of the Commissioner of Police, the Volunteer Corps can assist the police force in the event of serious internal disturbances. This year, a plan for food transportation during mobilization has been drafted, and a book titled "Shanghai Volunteer Corps Strategy" has been produced. The book contains training knowledge from formal armies and is adapted to the local conditions of the port, making it a very valuable work.</p>
<h3>Totaling 800 Yuan for the Whole Year</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce again submits to the Ministry of Finance, requesting to maintain the fineness of silver used by silverware shops.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted another request to the Ministry of Finance, requesting to maintain the existing fineness of silver used by the silverware industry. The submission stated (abridged): Upon investigation, the public association stated that switching to chemical silver or synthetic silver poses two major difficulties: worker skills and customary practices. Both are real situations. Leaving aside the issue of customary practices, the technical skills of the workers are a fundamental obstacle. These workers are accustomed to manual methods, and their manufacturing sites lack boiler equipment. Following the instructions of the Ministry would render the existing workers and equipment useless, requiring the addition of new machines and the recruitment and training of new workers. Regardless of the capital scale of the silverware shops, most would be unable to update their equipment and would inevitably be eliminated. The entire workforce, which has adhered to traditional methods for decades, would face the tragic fate of unemployment, fundamentally undermining the industry's request to preserve livelihoods. Therefore, after repeated deliberations, the association must appeal to the Ministry for some flexibility. Furthermore, there is no profit to be made from the private smuggling of silver ornaments, as detailed in the forwarded document to the Ministry on November 25 of last year. Once the nation faces an emergency, the people can offer their hidden ornaments for military use, as demonstrated by the example of Italy, which would not conflict with the national policy of preserving silver. Therefore, the association again submits a detailed written request, hoping that the Ministry will review and approve the public association's request, as it is in the public interest.</p>
<h3>Instructions from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Method for Affixing Stamps to Housing Tickets</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce recently replied to the Southeast Construction Company, instructing on the method for affixing stamps to housing tickets. The letter stated: We received your letter of the 5th of this month, inquiring about the method of affixing stamps to housing tickets. According to the Ministry of Finance's instructions on December 31 of last year, lease documents specifically refer to leases established by tenants when renting houses. If the monthly rent is less than 10 yuan, it is exempt from stamping. If it is 10 yuan or more, a 2-cent stamp should be affixed. Housing tickets used by landlords to collect rent should be stamped as silver receipt. The rental agreement does not apply. Therefore, according to the above ministerial instructions, housing tickets should be stamped as silver receipts: 1 cent for a monthly rent of 3 yuan or more, 2 cents for 10 yuan or more, and 3 cents for 100 yuan or more.</p>
<p>The Grains, Oil Cakes Industry Again Calls for Abolition of Provincial Surtaxes on Flour</p>
<p>The case of the grains and oil cakes industry's struggle against Guangdong Province's surtax on flour has lasted for half a year since August of last year. After the Fifth National Congress and other bodies advised oil factories in various regions to resume operations first, Guangdong Province has not yet complied with the order to abolish the surtax. Yesterday, another telegram was sent calling for its abolition. The original telegram is recorded below: To Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, Director Qu of the Finance Department of Guangdong: We are writing regarding the request to Guangdong Province to abolish the surtax on domestic flour for the construction of Sun Yat-sen University. It has been half a year since the telegram. The sound is so desperate. Since the Fifth National Congress approved orders for oil factories in various regions to resume work, it has been over two months. The goods are backed up, the monetary basis is blocked, the pain felt is really indescribable. A letter was recently received from the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which indicated the Guangdong Provincial Government had already submitted to the Southwest Political Affairs Committee for review. The surtax on domestic flour was originally collected for the construction of Sun Yat-sen University. Now the construction fund for Sun Yat-sen University has already been resolved by the First Plenary Session and will be allocated separately by the government. Therefore, the abolition of this surtax is not obstructed by any facts. Manufacturers and transporters from various regions are looking forward to the early issuance of the abolition order, which is almost like looking at the rainbow in a severe drought. Use non-speech to call, the length of the telegram, to approve the compassionate business, to turn Guangdong Province Finance Department, according to the situation, to discuss the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, and quickly issue an order to abolish it. Shanghai Municipal Grains and Oil Cakes Industry Association Gu Xinyi, Oil Factory Industry Association Zhu Jingan. Another letter from the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to the Grains and Oil Cakes Industry Association: Dear Sirs, on the 11th of this month, we received your letter, requesting us to forward a telegram to Zou Xiaochang, the Financial Commissioner of the Guangdong Provincial Government of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, urging him to stop collecting the flour surtax. We already sent the telegram and submitted the letter. On the 28th of this month, we received an official telegram from Qu Hao, the Financial Commissioner of Guangdong Province: Regarding the collection of surtax on flour fertilizer for the construction of Sun Yat-sen University, this office is carrying it out under orders. Without an explicit order to abolish it, this office must comply. The Provincial Government already submitted to the National Government's Southwest Political Affairs Committee on January 11, 25th year, No. 49. The Financial Department was instructed to review and submit for approval. This has already been done. Please wait patiently for the review and approval.</p>

<h3>The Cigarette Industry in Shanghai (3)</h3>
<p>— Compiled by China Credit Information</p>
<p>(No. 12 of the General Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce)</p>
<p>3. The Decline of the Cigarette Industry in Shanghai</p>
<p>In the first section of this article, it was mentioned that since the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), the national cigarette industry has been declining due to increased taxes, dumping of foreign goods, and other factors. In the first half of last year, the Ministry of Finance's ban on cigarette prize promotions made it even more difficult for Chinese cigarette factories to compete with foreign businesses. As a result, the output of various factories (referring to the country as a whole) decreased due to the shrinking sales. According to a report from the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, in January of last year, the number of cases cleared from the warehouses of cigarette factories in the three eastern provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui (most of which are in Shanghai) was 68,619.4 cases. In June, this decreased to 51,984.4 cases. The rate of decrease for Chinese cigarette factories was even greater than that of foreign businesses. Detailed information can be found in the table below:</p>
<p>Table of Changes in the Percentage of Output of Chinese and Foreign Cigarette Factories in the Eastern Region (Year 24 [1935])</p>
<p>From the table above, we can see the tenacious power of foreign businesses. At the same time, we also know that in addition to manufacturing in China, foreign businesses also import large quantities of cigarettes from overseas, expanding the scope and intensity of their dumping. According to customs statistics, cigarette imports in the past three years are shown in the following table (unit: yuan):</p>
<p>The increasing burden of unified taxes is a major reason for the national cigarette industry's decline. In theory, the impact of increased taxes should be the same for both Chinese and foreign cigarette factories. However, in reality, there are significant differences. The products of foreign businesses are mostly higher-end and more valuable, while Chinese cigarettes are mostly the opposite. However, in the past, the tax rates for more expensive products were relatively lower than those for lower-priced products, so Chinese businesses were often more heavily affected by the increased unified taxes than foreign businesses. To clarify this point, we will compare three foreign cigarette brands—Fairy, Front Gate, and Clic—with three Chinese cigarette brands—Golden Ax, Beauty, and Seven Stars—to illustrate the weight of unified taxes and the amount of profits:</p>
<p>Note: This table is from the Ta Kung Pao, September 5, Year 24 (1935)</p>
<p>This table reveals two facts: first, foreign cigarettes are taxed less heavily (with the upper-class Clic being the lightest); and second, foreign cigarettes have higher profits. The Chinese people must think carefully about these relationships. (End)</p>

New player Chen Zhongyu made his debut and proved to be extraordinary.  Newly selected World Games representatives Feng Nianhua and veteran Lu Zhongen, as forwards, launched subtle attacks, forming a perfect combination and earning cheers from all around as the score rapidly increased.

After that, Tung Wah's Feng, Chen, Sun, and Lu, probed and attacked from all sides, each showing their skills.  In a short time, they surged further ahead.  Mayling then launched a fierce attack, but Tung Wah was rich in experience and used looping passes to slow down their attacks, maintaining the lead until the end of the game.

<h3>Children's Educational Novel *Little Boy* (One)(Six)(Nine)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zheng Xiao-cang</p>
<p>"Bisey was sentenced to death. He petitioned the king to allow him to return home to visit his parents, promising to return to receive his punishment by a certain date. His close friend, Tan Meng, volunteered to be held hostage in his place. The king then imprisoned Tan Meng and allowed Bisey to go home. As the appointed date approached, Bisey had not yet returned, and Tan Meng was bound and taken to the execution ground to take his place. Just as the execution was about to begin, Bisey arrived in the wind and rain. The king, though tyrannical, was moved by their righteousness and released them both." (Note)</p>
<p>The children were deeply impressed by this immortal story, because they had just been deeply moved by the righteousness of a pair of young friends. Lying is not appropriate, but in order to repay a confidant, risking disgrace and calmly enduring humiliation for others—this great courage, this noble righteousness, made Dunn a hero they admired. Honesty and integrity have now gained a new meaning. A good name is more precious than wealth. Once lost, no amount of money can redeem it; and mutual trust can make life peaceful and happy, which nothing else can compare to.</p>
<p>Tao Mo happily resumed his original "company" name. Nai De was even more loyal to Dunn. The children all thought of ways to make up for their past suspicions and contempt for the two of them. Mrs. Shu was overjoyed to see her group of children. Mr. Pei praised the immortal deeds of his pair of young righteous friends without tiring.</p>
<p>(Note) Damon and Pyrhias. The king was Dionysus (the original text only lists the names of the two people, the translation supplements the story). The story of Jing Ke and Fan Yuqi in our country is also somewhat similar. (End of chapter)</p>

<h3>Financial Market: Silver Prices Decline, Stimulating Buying Sentiment, Standard Gold Rises 2.2 Yuan</h3>
<p>Fluctuations of Only 2.4 Yuan in One Day. Transaction Volume Also Only Slightly Over 6,000 Taels</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday saw a slight increase in buying sentiment due to the decline in silver prices. However, the market was sluggish throughout the day, fluctuating only 2.4 yuan, and the transaction volume was only slightly over 6,000 taels. The situation was particularly desolate, and the trend was also flat. In the early morning, the overseas silver market saw declines in London and stability in the United States. Large forward contracts were already being traded, with prices at 19 3125 pence. Forward silver prices in Montevideo fell by 3.5 to 6.5 centavos. Exchange rates fell slightly. The price of raw gold in London rose by 4 pence. The central bank's official exchange rate was announced, with both the British pound and the US dollar remaining stable. The customs gold unit rose by 4 cents. The standard gold price was listed as 1145.2 yuan. The market sentiment was stable, and the opening price was high. After the opening, there was a considerable flow of supply taking advantage of the high prices, and prices gradually declined. The banks' appetite was inconsistent, and the demand for supply was mediocre after the decline, with prices fluctuating only slightly. The HSBC's official exchange rate was announced, with both the British pound and the US dollar remaining stable. Thereafter, there was a slight rebound, but because the white silver equilibrium tax was announced to be down by 1.75 cents, prices still declined slightly. Afterwards, the interbank market was dull, and trading in the market was even scarcer, with prices fluctuating around 47 yuan. There was no change at noon. The afternoon market was even more sluggish, with prices only slightly above 47 yuan. Exchange rates were quiet, with even fewer fluctuations. It was not until the first report of the Indian silver market declining by 4 annas, the second report remaining unchanged, and then increasing by 1 anna that prices began to fluctuate slightly. However, the final trend was still stagnant. Those who were unwinding their positions at the time were posting 4 yuan for spot. The day's market conditions are recorded as follows:</p>

After entering the market, the white silver equilibrium tax was announced to be down by 1.75 cents. The banks' appetite was inconsistent, but because there were not many transactions, the trend was particularly mediocre. The fact that banks were doing business with each other showed that US dollars were quite popular. The afternoon market was even more peaceful, with even fewer transactions. Banks were slightly doing business with each other for shillings, and slightly filling in forward US dollars. The first report from the Indian silver market reported a decline of 4 annas, the second report also reported unchanged, and a rise of 1 anna. There was not much impact here.

<h3>Securities: New York Stocks May Have a Reaction</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (the 5th), New York stocks saw mixed gains and losses. Chrysler Motor Company is scheduled to hold a board meeting on Thursday. It is widely speculated that the dividend announced at that time may be lower than expected. At the close, many long positions were sold off, causing the stock to plummet. Agricultural implements and mail-order stocks were strong throughout the day, once hitting a new high since 1931. However, they also fell back with the market. Speculators expect the market to have a reaction, so when Chrysler Motors fell, they began to sell off. Furthermore, the appreciation of the US dollar caused the market to lose some of its inflationary stimulus. Stocks on the small exchange also saw mixed gains and losses. Oil stocks were frequently traded. In the bond market, the Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Prices Plunge</p>
<p>May Yarn Approaching the 200 Yuan Mark. Current Yarn Prices Down More Than One Yuan.</p>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, and the decline intensified. This was due to the poor trend of overseas yarn and cotton, which caused panic in the market. Generally, many long positions were being liquidated due to the poor environment, which threatened the market's ability to support itself. The future depends on the overseas cotton market.</p>
<p>Down 1.8 to 2.6 Yuan. At the beginning of the morning market, standard yarn continued to decline, and the decline was sharp. Because overseas yarn and cloth were weak, the Osaka Sampin Yarn Market was falling step by step, and the market became more and more alarmed. Selling pressure in the market was strong, and prices were difficult to stabilize. As a result, the prices for each month fell 1.8 to 2.1 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. At the opening of the afternoon market, short positions were slightly covered to take profits, and there was a slight rebound. However, after the second market, the news was bad, and the selling pressure was still strong, turning downward again. As a result, the prices for each month fell 1.3, 4, and 5 jiao compared to the morning closing price. In fact, Tongfu sold 1,650 bales, Zhenda 1,000 bales, Hexing 850 bales, Changfeng 3,650 bales, Runkang 1,850 bales, Dachang 850 bales, Changyu 500 bales, Renfeng 700 bales, Jinjin Daji 2 650 bales, Jinchang 550 bales, Shenji 400 bales, Yicheng 650 bales, Taichang 1,900 bales, Xincheng 2,900 bales, Dafeng 500 bales, and Gengfeng 8 850 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>683 Bales of Current Yarn Traded. The sales of current yarn were mediocre. According to the statistics of the transaction volume of each group throughout the day, 683 bales were traded, and prices fell by more than 1 yuan. The purchase amount of each group is as follows:</p>
<p>Prices of Chinese and Indian Cotton Approaching.</p>
<p>The cotton market continued to decline, and the situation was extremely weak. Because American cotton fell, the news was beneficial to sellers, and the decline in Indian cotton intensified, and the price ratio became closer and closer, so the market was very weak, and prices plummeted.</p>
<p>Ningbo Group Adding Codes and Tongcheng Closing Positions. At the beginning of the morning market, standard cotton prices showed a sign of sharp falls in each month, because American cotton continued to fall by 12 to 17 points, Indian cotton also fell by 0.25 to 2 rupees and a half, and Osaka Sampin yarn fell by 6.7 jiao, so the market was turbulent, and the selling pressure was strong. Prices were becoming more and more unsustainable, and were declining every minute. The Ningbo Group continued to add codes, and Tongcheng Company closed many long positions. As a result, the prices for each month fell 0.5 to 6.7.8 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. At the opening of the afternoon market, short positions were slightly covered to take profits and rebounded, but after the second round, it was heard that the secret market of Indian cotton was still rising downwards, and the market situation re-entered a weak state. As a result, the price for this month rose by 0.1 jiao compared to the morning market, and the prices for distant months were unchanged. In fact, Dafu sold 3,400 dan, Dafeng 4,000 dan, Mingde 1,400 dan, Hexing 4,400 dan, Senkang 2,600 dan, Tongfeng 3,200 dan, Dachang 1,300 dan, Yuanxingchang 3,300 dan, Yichang 1,700 dan, Taichang 1,300 dan. Tongji bought 1,900 dan, Gengfeng 1,900 dan, Changji 1,700 dan, Hengde 1,600 dan, Shenji 3,600 dan, Yuanyi 2,400 dan, Taichang 1,600 dan, Runkang 7,100 dan, Shengyuan 1,500 dan, and Changhe 1,200 dan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Difficult to Approximate Current Cotton Prices. Consumption of current cotton has turned sluggish, and factory demand has stopped. Because futures cotton has been falling wildly for days, it has been difficult for both parties to bargain, and no transactions have been made. There are also no sources.</p>
<h3>The American Cotton Crowd Tends to Sell</h3>
<p>--Down 12 to 15 Points--</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened. The news from Liverpool was bad, foreign merchants sold, and many long positions were liquidated. Each month fell by 9 to 11 points. Long positions were moved from the near term to the distant term. Dealers bought near-term contracts and sold October contracts. The government's plan to sell old cotton and the farm bill were uncertain factors in the market. Finally, the crowd sold, and the situation became weak again. The spot price fell by 15 points, and the futures price fell by 12 to 18 points. English cotton's spot price fell by 10 points, and the futures price fell by 45 points. Indian cotton futures merchants sold, and many long positions were liquidated. European exporters bought, and then hedged by cross-buying. Speculators bought. The Pingguoer fell by 0.25 rupees, the Aomula fell by 2.25 rupees, and the Bailuoxi fell by 2.5 to 3 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegram on the 5th)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for the Bailuoxi cotton on the 6th was 192 rupees, down 0.75 rupees from the previous day's closing price.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton Both Fell</p>
<p>A telegram from Osaka on the 6th: Sampin futures yarn fell by 1.8 yuan and 2.8 yuan. The near-term price was 188.6 yuan, and the distant-term price was 188 yuan. Futures cotton fell by 0.55 to 0.95 yuan. The near-term price was 60 yuan, and the distant-term price was 57.85 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains: Futures Flour Sales Activate in the Future</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the flour market, the market situation in each month at the opening in the morning showed a sign of initial stability followed by flatness. Because the price of foreign wheat, in both Chicago and Canada, recovered by 8 points to 1.2 jiao, the opening price, the near and distant markets were slightly better by about 1 fen. After entering the market, the market was weak again due to the long positions returning. However, because of the internal and external observations of each market, the transactions were light. Only about 160,000 packages were transacted in the morning. At the opening in the afternoon, it was initially stable. Soon, due to recent flour's North Road sales moving, buying became more expensive again. The June delivery was a transition between the new and old, and it also saw a slight rise. Transactions in July were rare, and there were many ups and downs.</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market: in the morning opening, prices for all months fluctuated little and trading was not brisk. However, in the afternoon opening, there was initially little trading, but later, due to a recovery in the flour market, sentiment was stimulated. Near and distant futures rose by varying amounts of five to six points. Subsequent observations suggest that old wheat is unlikely to fall due to limited inventory. Prices for June and July depend half on weather conditions and half on foreign wheat. Spot wheat prices are also seen to be firm, with higher-grade offerings increasing by another five points. Shandong Yanghe and Luohe wheat was quoted at five yuan and three jiao, Changzhou wheat at five yuan, two jiao and seven fen, and Yaowan wheat at five yuan, two jiao and nine fen, totaling 2,500 bags, reportedly purchased by Fuxin and Fufeng mills.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat market conditions were sluggish and flat. Farmers and wheat in transit can be supplied, totaling 244,506,000 bushels.</p>
<p>Shanghai Silk and Tea Export Situation in the Twenty-Fourth Year</p>
<h3>Rice Market Dull</h3>
<p>Thin Rice Falls Further</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, supplies from various sources totaled over twenty firms (goods totaling over 4,000 piculs). Both retail and wholesale markets were sluggish. Only Qingdao and Longkou suppliers purchased seven to eight hundred bags, causing the thin rice market to fall further. Su Tong japonica rice remained firm due to scarcity. Nangang rice continued to depreciate by five fen. Dujian rice remained unchanged, and Yinyuan rice had no market.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, thirty-four or five boats arrived from various routes downstream. Sales of various types of rice in the market were: white japonica rice was dull, and retail sales of dry thin rice saw some transactions, with prices trending towards stability. Yangbu pointed rice saw some retail sales, with market prices showing little change. White yuan rice continued to be sold in stores, and the market was firm. Customer pointed rice sales were sluggish, and prices softened slightly. Prices for other types of rice remained similar to previous days.</p>
<h3>Continued Arrival of Customer Indica Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday's customer indica rice market: the situation turned soft. Only Jiujiang and Wenzhou/Taizhou delivered four to five thousand bags. Other sporadic arrivals and goods en route continued, but both north and south were in a wait-and-see mode. Stockholders were also inactive. Only local brokers were active, and the market became weak. Total market sales included 1,500 bags of early and late Jiangxi rice and over one hundred bags of Taizhou Liu rice. Foreign rice has been shunned for a long time. Yesterday, a total of 250 bags of high-grade rice were offered and were purchased by local brokers. Market prices were similar to the previous market, but the situation was soft.</p>
<h3>Soybean Prices Fall Slightly After Continuous Reports</h3>
<p>Recently, the trading of yellow soybeans has only involved Zha soybeans, Du soybeans, and Sha yellow soybeans. Although Guangshan and local brokers still inquired, sales have declined, and the market is flat. Yesterday, over one thousand bags of various soybeans were traded. Prices for car soybeans were high and sales were sluggish. The continued decline in the Dalian market led to a lack of confidence, and prices fell. Compared to the previous market, prices fell by about a jiao. Yesterday, one car of Bengbu soybeans and one car of Zhengyangguan soybeans were purchased by factories. Regarding foreign sesame, 200 tons were purchased by Daofu Foreign Company the day before yesterday at a price of eleven yuan. The overall trend remains weak.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Increased Actual Sales of Raw Silk in New York</h3>
<p>According to the New York Raw Silk Inventory Report for the previous month, Shanghai silk exports to the United States decreased by 820 bales compared to the previous month, while the actual sales volume in the United States last month increased by 3,436 bales compared to the previous month. The details are listed below:</p>
<h3>Active Domestic Sales of Xiumei Green Tea</h3>
<p>Recently, the green tea market has been quite quiet for foreign firms. There have been no transactions for Zhenmei pearl tea and other items. Telegrams sent by British and French firms a few days ago have not received a response. The market situation is unlikely to improve. However, low-grade Xiumei green tea has seen some domestic sales. Many customer brokers from Tianjin and Fujian are frequently requesting purchases by telegram. In recent days, tea merchants such as Yilongyuan and Fengrun have sold over 400 dan at a price of eleven yuan and three jiao. The inventory of these broken leaves is becoming increasingly scarce. Due to the lack of supply, tea merchants are more confident than before, and the market is expected to rise.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Domestically Produced Qing Sugar Rises Another Two Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw a slight increase in Customs Gold, with closing prices at 2.270. The trend remains stable. The guild set the price for spot No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar at 22 yuan and seven jiao, and re-exported goods at six yuan and six jiao. Other Dongchi, Dongbai, and local cotton white sugar remained unchanged. However, foreign coarse white sugar saw a slight easing of prices from foreign firms. Xiangtai sold 300 tons of coarse white sugar for immediate delivery at a price of 3.29 Dutch currency. Xinyi sold 200 tons for immediate delivery, slightly lower at 3.08 Dutch currency. The price for the next grade was 7.75 to 7.6 jiao, up by two jiao, with over 200 bags traded. Jianbang offered over 500 bags of new Qing sugar at a price of 9.7 jiao, also up by two jiao. (Yesterday's report mistakenly used "ocean" instead of "red" for "high branch ocean". The guild has corrected this.)</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Scarcity of Assorted Longan Continues</h3>
<p>The supply of assorted longan has not increased since the price increase in the red market, mainly due to the truly limited inventory. Yesterday, the Qiongzhou wheel imported only 57 pieces, including 30 small boxes, 10 medium boxes, and 17 large boxes, totaling less than 50 dan. Therefore, the trend remains firm.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Brisk Sales of Sesame Nails</h3>
<p>Since the Gongqin factory in this port started producing sesame nails, the supply of imported goods has decreased. When customer brokers have needs, they all purchase products from this factory. Therefore, sales have been quite prosperous since the New Year. In the past two days, over 200 boxes were offered on the market, with prices at 300 packages for three fen, 26 yuan per box for four fen, 21 yuan, 20 yuan for five fen and 19 yuan for six fen. The most active buyers were brokers from Fujian and Hankou. Brokers from Sichuan and Xi'an also purchased some. However, sales to Tianjin and Beiping have sharply declined due to the current situation, which is somewhat disappointing.</p>
<h3>Sudden Increase in US Co Steel Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a telegram from New York reported that the price of US 200-pound Co Steel rose by 7 jiao (previously quoted by Wealth Company at 6.4 dollars per box). Therefore, the market in this port is quite firm. The atmosphere of tightening loans in the foreign silver market is very strong, which will inevitably have a significant impact on future sales.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Yuanfang's Called Goods See Unique Rise in Yu Yuchou Silk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Thursday, Yuanfang Foreign Company held its 2,975th auction, displaying 66 boxes of goods. The red market situation showed that Western satin was inferior to the previous period. Yuan velvet saw minimal changes, and Zhigong woolen cloth also decreased. However, Yu Yuchou silk sales were active as the spring season approaches. Except for the Huazhu picture, which was slightly lower, the rest rose by several jiao.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Silk and Tea Export Situation in the Twenty-Fourth Year</h3>
<p>Last year's Shanghai raw silk exports, according to the report of the Silk Group of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, were 21,364 bales to Europe, an increase of 11,130 bales compared to 10,234 bales in the twenty-third year. Exports to the Americas were 24,538 bales, an increase of 19,283 bales compared to 5,255 bales in the twenty-third year. Exports to ports in Asia and Africa were 9,105 bales, an increase of 886 bales compared to 8,219 bales in the twenty-third year. Total exports were 55,007 bales, an increase of 31,299 bales compared to 23,708 bales in the twenty-third year.</p>
<p>Last year's Shanghai Chinese tea exports, according to the report of the Tea Inspection Department of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, were 13,215.19 metric tons of green tea, 69,318.71 dan of black tea, 68,342.92 dan of brick tea, and 14,446.09 dan of other tea, totaling 290,322.91 dan, a decrease of over 80,000 dan compared to the total in the twenty-third year. Among them, black tea saw the largest decrease, totaling over 44,000 dan, followed by brick tea, totaling over 30,000 dan. However, green tea saw a slight increase. The following table compares the figures for December of last year and the entire year with the twenty-third year:</p>
<p>Note: * indicates that brick tea or brick tea may be included. Brick tea exports in December of the twenty-fourth year were 12,453.23 dan, the entire year of the twenty-fourth year was 68,342.92 dan, and the entire year of the twenty-third year was 98,716.65 dan.</p>

<h3>Blood</h3>
<p>— Bai</p>
<p>The man stood in front of the bed, spreading his hands, pleading with the woman. His eyes shone with begging light, almost crying: "If you still don't believe me, then I really want to commit suicide!"</p>
<p>The woman pursed her lips, smiling contemptuously: "Humph!" She turned over and went to sleep facing the bed. Her hand was scribbling randomly on a glass mirror inside the bed, asking: "Use a pistol, sleeping pills, or our kitchen knife?" She desperately suppressed her laughter because she should be angry now.</p>
<p>The man was struck, seeing the cold face in the mirror, he couldn't help but hold his head in his hands, grabbing his hair, making a gesture of unbearable pain. But the woman's eyes closed.</p>
<p>The man suddenly thought of the kitchen knife—the kitchen knife the woman mentioned. He turned his head and looked through the crack in the door to the alcove used as a kitchen. On a table lay a shiny kitchen knife, emitting a cold, icy light. He couldn't help but feel a chill all over his body and turned back.</p>
<p>"!..." He had not forgotten the tremulous tone he used to use on stage to express affection and sorrow, and called out softly. —But she, did not respond. The sound of breathing grew louder, making it seem like she was asleep.</p>
<p>The man's voice was even more miserable: "Ah!… Ah-Lan!…!"</p>
<p>She suddenly turned over, pulling a face: "I didn't commit suicide either, what are you yelling about!"</p>
<p>He was as embarrassed as a rabbit, lowering his voice: "Lan, do you really not believe me?"</p>
<p>"Don't believe it! Don't believe it! I won't believe it even if I die!"</p>
<p>Everyone was silent.</p>
<p>She said angrily: "A wife only needs to have three meals a day, and she has enjoyed all her rights, why should she care about someone else's lover or not?"</p>
<p>The man knelt in front of the bed. "Do you really believe I love her?"</p>
<p>She pounded the edge of the bed. "I don't care about your bullshit! Don't talk to me!"</p>
<p>He spoke in a softer voice: "Lan, don't worry, no matter what, I won't fall in love with her!…" He waited a moment, and then said: "Don't be suspicious, how can you avoid contact with people in social interactions?… Just believe me,… just believe me!…" He himself believed his own words, his eyes turned to the sky, his hands clasped together, as if he was swearing to others, and his chest was filled with grievances.</p>
<p>She just opened her mouth: "You?…"</p>
<p>He continued in a gentler voice: "For example, yourself, your cousin…" His heart felt a pang of bitterness. "He's so close to you, but can I doubt you?"</p>
<p>Her heart stirred, and her face suddenly felt a little hot, she couldn't speak for a moment. She cursed him: "Bullshit!" Then she turned to face the bed again.</p>
<p>He still explained to her with such a good temper: "Lan, your problem is that you are too suspicious! But you are wrong: you shouldn't suspect others first; because you should first see if I have something to do with it… Lan, you should believe me!…" He called out like a sheep.</p>
<p>"! "The wife sneered: "Asking me to trust you is harder than asking me to believe I'm dead!" She slapped the side of the bed: "I'm telling you: I want to sleep, don't talk to me anymore!" She wrapped the quilt around herself and fell towards the inside.</p>
<p>The man stood blankly in front of the bed.</p>
<p>He thought, looking for a way to prove his loyalty.</p>
<p>The kitchen knife in the kitchen emitted a cold, icy light, quietly staring at him. He couldn't help but think of his own words, and he felt his hair stand on end. He hardened his heart, rushed into the kitchen, and grabbed the kitchen knife.</p>
<p>It's a pity that this kitchen knife is too clumsy in style: the handle is so short, the blade has no point, and it is square, just like a shovel! This made him miss the dagger that the Syrian boy used to commit suicide in the Salome on stage: it had a beautifully decorated handle and a cone-shaped blade. Holding it against the chest, it was a kind of heroic spirit! He couldn't help but loosen his hand, and the kitchen knife fell to the ground with a "slap". He walked out of the alcove in despair. He sighed long and dejectedly.</p>
<p>But he could not just settle down in his heart. He was still looking everywhere for things that could be used. Good, a pair of scissors was shining under the dressing table. He grabbed it. —At the same time, he looked back at her on the bed, she was still sleeping with her face turned inward. —Turning around, he pulled out the scissors and looked at them for a while. He was thinking: "Oh, I remember she bought this from the Sincere Company to trim her nails!" This is an American product, the style is very beautiful, it is nickel-plated on the outside, shining brightly. Holding it upside down in his hand, with the scissor head facing inward, it actually looked like a dagger!</p>
<p>He tried to stab himself in the throat. But the one on the bed was still sleeping with her face turned inward, without any sound.</p>
<p>He stood there for a while, feeling that although the scissors were beautiful, they were not sharp. At most, this thing would make people bleed painfully, but it could not satisfy his demands. He sighed again.</p>
<p>But he still couldn't feel at ease. —So he searched his body for something to use, and finally found a fleshy part on the side of his thigh. —The reason why he specially looked for this place was not because it was not important; but because he felt that: first, this place was very easy to reach; second, this kind of thing was not deliberately showing off to people, not letting people see it showed that it came from the heart. —So, he started; he carefully cut his left leg, but the muscle was a little elastic and slipped. He hated that the scissors were not sharp enough, so he immediately pinched the flesh hard and cut it. Hey, immediately a triangular scar appeared!</p>
<p>He watched the wound in pain, but no blood flowed out, he was disappointed. The scissors fell to the ground with a "snap".</p>
<p>But half a minute later, a trace of bright red blood flowed out of the wound. Although it was such a thin strand, he seemed to see a torrent of blood, staring in shock, without even wiping it off, letting it flow longer and longer.</p>
<p>So: "Ah! Blood…" he shouted:</p>
<p>He saw her turn her body further inside, and fall asleep again. And in that mirror, a smiling face of contempt appeared. —It was like a basin of cold water was poured on his heart, he was stunned.</p>
<p>After a while of silence, the man slumped into a chair in despair. That night, he was so angry that he couldn't fall asleep.</p>
<p>The one on the bed didn't sleep either, she was thinking: what method to use to retaliate against him.</p>
<h3>Frontier Clouds</h3>
<p>— Yingzi</p>
<p>The wind, like a wild beast freed from its cage, was howling in the desert plains and frontier cities, striking coldly not only people's faces and bodies but also their hearts. As the weather turned cold and harsh, people, like hibernating soft-bodied animals, stopped moving. The only ones left on the streets were wandering people calling out for grandfathers and grandmothers. Was it safe to stay at home? Perhaps! Safe in the sense that you could avoid going out and freezing your body, hands, and feet, or even lying down without realizing it. But what loomed large in everyone's mind was that question mark of insecurity: "When will 'they' come?" Looking up at the sky, the sky was a vast expanse of blue, like a boundless deep sea. Early in the morning, you could still hear the cawing of crows in flocks and the humming of pigeons released by wild children with "bamboo tubes" attached to them, which was very loud in the fresh air.</p>
<p>The local newspapers, like toy dolls wearing the same mask, printed rigid government orders, mostly the talks of Mongolian dignitaries. The frontier clouds seemed to be sunny days on these pages. Occasionally, there were also reports of stable news. But even so, it was revealed that "they" were already deploying, and perhaps a thunderbolt would strike in the cold weather of winter, shaking the people trapped in the cold cellar of body and mind.</p>
<p>Secretly, people would ask each other when they met: "! What's happening? Are they coming? Alas! Alas! Surely there's still the Lunar New Year to get through!" In secret, with the power of "they", [some people] became active, doing the same old things. The Rising Sun flag flew high in a corner of the city, symbolizing the success of these people.</p>
<p>What should we do?</p>
<p>An airplane dragging a red ball tail flew over the blue sky as usual, so low that you could see who was sitting in the plane. People didn't know where these planes came from or where they were going, they just muttered: "Won't they drop eggs?"</p>
<p>With the increasing power of [some people], people cast another dark shadow deep in their hearts, recalling memories from hundreds of years ago: "Ah! Soldiers are cruel!" The shadow of Genghis Khan's massacres, like a whip, struck fear into people's hearts.</p>
<p>"The barbarian hordes move south to graze their horses." The literate people thought in their hearts: "That day is coming soon!"</p>
<p>The families of people from outside were slowly moving back home. Where should the people of the frontier move? Let's wait! Living one day at a time, the people of the frontier are true "live for today" people.</p>
<p>The frontier clouds are gradually changing color! The Fiery Mountain is covered with snowflakes, and everything is quietly waiting for that clap of thunder!</p>
<h3>Untitled</h3>
<p>— Qi Fu</p>
<p>"We're going out to give a speech today," my nephew told me excitedly when he came back very late at night.</p>
<p>"Did you blush?" I asked with a smile. "Did anyone listen?"</p>
<p>"Yes, this is my first time giving a speech. I not only blushed, but my voice also trembled a little. But it will be fine after giving a few speeches. There were several hundred people listening, and some people even asked us to give the speech."</p>
<p>When my nephew reported to me with the enthusiasm and pride of youth, I, who have been living in memories lately, deeply felt that I was old.</p>
<p>When the May Fourth Movement swept in, I, with the same youthful enthusiasm and pride, chased after the waves. When the blood-curdling cries of "March 8th" came, I also excitedly followed my classmates to give maiden propaganda speeches. In the ranks of the May 30th Movement, I began to understand the greatness of the masses and began to gain a sense of "unity of purpose." The bloodstains splashed on my body on "June 23rd" were even more like the brand of an initiate, imprinted on my life. Later, I also held my breath under thousands of flags and stood on end among the thunderous shouts, but that was no longer in China.</p>
<p>All of this has now become a trace of history. Youth has left me behind, and the sound of the great waves has gradually faded away, far away.</p>
<p>In a steady and unobtrusive manner, the "September 18th" Incident and the "January 28th" Incident passed through a few unstable years. Even the corpses of the "May Fourth" and "March 8th" eras have finally been resurrected, and have been resurrected with a new and more terrifying face. However, in front of them, blood is still flowing, and blood is still first smeared on the ancient city that is like a tomb with a tragic history, and the blood is still the blood of the enthusiastic and proud youth—even though it is the second generation of youth.</p>
<p>Although scholars' rebellion takes three years to fail, the students who interfere in politics, because they are good at slander, have been thorns in the back of the rulers since ancient times. They will not be happy until they are pulled out. The imprisoned college students at the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty and the Donglin Fushe who were killed in the late Ming Dynasty were all destined for the same fate. Yes, in the mouths of the older generation, behaviors such as boycotting classes and parades are not mischievous pranks of children, but also reckless actions that are not content with their own duties. —Even though some of them personally did such heinous things, but, this is one time and that is another! —However, in their hearts, they never believe that this is a simple malicious prank, but a vortex that can stir the water mill of history. In France in 1789, the Parisian masses who destroyed the Bastille prison and the hungry women who forced Louis XVI to return to Paris from Versailles, were not they also seen as childish troublemakers in the eyes of the nobles at the time, and even in the writings of some historians? In the colony, wouldn't such mass truancy have almost the same serious impact?</p>
<p>Of course, great movements are not accomplished by this, but great movements often begin with this.</p>
<p>Only the individual is old, but the history of the entire human society is constantly renewed and advanced with the vitality of youth.</p>
<h3>I Still Have One Eye</h3>
<p>— Zhang Chunqiao</p>
<p>Arise, you enslaved ones filled with anger!</p>
<p>Burn, you compressed layers of coal!</p>
<p>Roar, my beloved brothers!</p>
<p>Please sit here for a moment,</p>
<p>Don't say this place is too terribly dim,</p>
<p>The dirty soil will stain your clothes,</p>
<p>And the squinting dust.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a large temple,</p>
<p>Living here is like being in a tomb,</p>
<p>The owl cries a string of sorrow,</p>
<p>The sorrowful song accompanies the statue,</p>
<p>The withered old cypress is silent,</p>
<p>The wings of the big wind cannot fan back its life.</p>
<p>But, you have to know there are times,</p>
<p>This place is as turbulent as the seaside,</p>
<p>That's a temple fair or some memorial,</p>
<p>People hold feasts here,</p>
<p>I clearly know this place,</p>
<p>Like knowing I only have one eye left.</p>
<p>(If you don't believe me,</p>
<p>Strike a match and take a look—</p>
<p>One spitting out bright light,</p>
<p>The other has lost its flame.)</p>
<p>Speaking of which, it's been a long time,</p>
<p>A bitterly cold winter,</p>
<p>Our army was stationed in Shanghai,</p>
<p>A wide road separating two worlds,</p>
<p>On one side, the angry us,</p>
<p>Armed enemies standing opposite.</p>
<p>Gun barrels aimed at the enemy,</p>
<p>Hearts leaping like flames,</p>
<p>As long as a shout,</p>
<p>Bombs melted the ice.</p>
<p>The winter streets were especially desolate,</p>
<p>Towering houses flashing ghostly shadows,</p>
<p>Gunshots rang out on the dark horizon,</p>
<p>Qiujiang Road, Baoshan Road, became torches,</p>
<p>In an instant, the sky was burning red,</p>
<p>Arise, you enslaved ones filled with anger!</p>
<p>Burn, you compressed layers of coal!</p>
<p>We are like a herd of crazy beasts,</p>
<p>Blood splashes wake up the enemy's dreams!</p>
<p>What cannot be forgotten are those brothers,</p>
<p>Chain of love, grasped until hands hurt,</p>
<p>They are workers, farmers, students,</p>
<p>We are soldiers!</p>
<p>Holding up guns, the sound rings in our ears:</p>
<p>"Charge! Defend our brothers!"</p>
<p>But I was injured, lost an eye,</p>
<p>We were confined to the hospital,</p>
<p>Every heart tied to the battlefield.</p>
<p>"Don't ask, don't read the newspaper,</p>
<p>Don't think about those things."</p>
<p>The enemy's plane rattled,</p>
<p>We were carried to the rear again.</p>
<p>Later, I heard, "Ceasefire!"</p>
<p>What the heck!</p>
<p>This is clearly a lie,</p>
<p>How could we fail,</p>
<p>We have countless brothers!</p>
<p>From then on, I was blind, blind in one eye,</p>
<p>Left the hospital,</p>
<p>Lived in this ancient temple.</p>
<p>From morning to night, from night to morning,</p>
<p>I hope one day,</p>
<p>The enemy will be driven out of the country,</p>
<p>Every day I wander on the old battlefield,</p>
<p>A stretch of ruined houses, lying,</p>
<p>Like a clumsy old bear.</p>
<p>Sloping stone pillars, pieces of white bones,</p>
<p>Everything is still like yesterday.</p>
<p>My brother is buried here,</p>
<p>Wang Desheng is buried here,</p>
<p>Zhang Jinzhong is also buried here.</p>
<p>One day, this family started to dig,</p>
<p>That family started construction again.</p>
<p>Today, it has restored its past state,</p>
<p>Today, there are no angry gunshots!</p>
<p>Arise, you enslaved ones filled with anger!</p>
<p>Burn, you compressed layers of coal!</p>
<p>Roar, my beloved brothers!</p>
<p>Although I only have one eye left,</p>
<p>I can see the world clearly,</p>
<p>Only by lighting torches,</p>
<p>The iron chain will not loosen!</p>
<p>Staring with this eye,</p>
<p>I sing loudly for a bright day!</p>
<h3>The Strange Carpenter</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Shan</p>
<p>It doesn't need proof that many people waste their lives through their compromises, selfishness, and laziness. But many others are wasted by life. Life is created by humanity -- based on reason, so it is wonderful. But is it really so? When it is entangled in a deceptive web and falls straight into the pit of sin, it will drag down countless people along with it... Isn't reason ugly, paradoxical, and a shameful mistake? ...</p>
<p>The strange Shen Jia was a young, gentle, and skillful carpenter. -- Yes, everyone knew that there was such a carpenter in Guanfu Lane. His cheekbones and teeth protruded outward, his face was long and small, his short black hair stood up on his head like a large brush, his eyes were not very bright, covered with coarse red blood vessels. He was strong, cheerful, unmarried, and passionately loved other people's children.</p>
<p>He said:</p>
<p>"Making chairs and tables -- that doesn't count as being a carpenter! Carving vase stands and planing gunstocks are the most shameless things to do!"</p>
<p>His boss, Wang Fulai, replied:</p>
<p>"That's not how it works. Everyone who follows my orders is a carpenter! What -- 'I don't like to do this, I can't do that,' are clearly wrong. My words are right."</p>
<p>Wang Fulai was a famous, wealthy local who gambled on pigeon lotteries and was very good at exploiting his employees.</p>
<p>Shen Jia was one of the most inattentive and unmotivated employees. He yawned long and surprisingly in front of Wang Fulai, as if he hadn't had a good night's sleep in years. He fell asleep on the planing bench, almost forcing his boss to kick him awake with his cloth shoe. "Aren't you planning to keep working here?"</p>
<p>"Can't you give me a little raise?" he replied, as if Wang Fulai had done something very wrong to him and he had already generously forgiven him, only to honestly continue out of embarrassment: "I know you'll eventually fire me. But if you really do that, you know you'll starve me to death."</p>
<p>Wang Fulai gave him an extra two cents in wages every day. He was obeying a saying: "Good things aren't cheap, cheap things aren't good." Shen Jia's cheekbones protruded even further and were bright red, shining with oil, indicating his happiness.</p>
<p>But in less than two months, he relapsed into laziness and depression.</p>
<p>His head drooped thoughtfully, his upper and lower lips twisted and cracked -- everyone believed it was because they had tried so hard to contain those teeth, and that was the result.</p>
<p>"You see, I'm just not like this kind of person. -- Isn't it inexcusable to be unfair to the boss?"</p>
<p>He roared, telling his spiritual phenomena to his uncle, Shen Zezhi. Shen Zezhi was a hopeless opium addict, with a pale gray face, his shoulders always shrugging as if cold, and his lips large and everted.</p>
<p>"Okay, let me see what kind of person you are."</p>
<p>He wandered silently around the room, picked up clothes, teacups, looked at them meticulously, smelled them, and then after a dozen minutes, he slowly asked his nephew, Shen Jia:</p>
<p>"Now, give me some money." Only when he received invitations and orders from roommates or neighbors was he happy and enthusiastic, completely regaining the vitality of youth.</p>
<p>He took wood, ash oil, paint, trim, and other kinds of furniture supplies from the store home without letting Wang Fulai know. It was painful for him to do this. He did it for a certain pleasure that he couldn't get otherwise, and he could also estimate how much those materials were worth under the boss's plan.</p>
<p>He made many cabinets, square chairs, chicken coops, low stools, and washstands for others without receiving any payment. He also often responded to their calls to repair things like wardrobes, Eight Immortals tables, planks, and ancestral shrines. Once he even completely repainted a pair of brown door panels.</p>
<p>Sometimes they treated him to two hundred cash worth of double-distilled liquor.</p>
<p>"Really -- how can you live like this?"</p>
<p>"I didn't do it for you. I did it for myself."</p>
<p>He replied to everyone this way.</p>
<p>His ingenious ideas and true ability were expressed in the toys he tried to make, and some things that looked like toys but couldn't be designated for any use. This young carpenter in his twenties used saws, planes, chisels, lathes, and hammers -- these clumsy tools -- to make some things that were indeed very interesting.</p>
<p>The small room was so dark that even in the daytime, it needed to be lit. It was filled with the results of his work. Among them were several things he truly liked: a large wooden plate with various small creatures made of wood -- people, cows, dogs, horses; according to his wishes, he could change the positions of each, one chasing after another, or leading, biting, or wrestling. Two people carved from a piece of wood, a man and a woman, their heads and limbs were movable, so they could hug each other intimately, or fight each other fiercely. A snow-white goose with a long neck and high bun, the skin layer could be opened, inside there were colored viscera -- this was imitated from some kind of cross-sectional animal specimen displayed in the window of a bookstore on Shuangmen Bottom Street. On the wall was a lion dance picture, only partially completed, drawn first with ink, and then made of colored wooden strips, pieces, and iron pieces, broken glass. -- After finishing work at the store, he would work and play silently in the room.</p>
<p>He gave even his most beloved things as gifts to some children, those who were familiar with him or unrelated, even just passers-by.</p>
<p>Rough, crude, but abundant talent, this carpenter found this way to consume it.</p>
<p>His opium-smoking uncle, Shen Zezhi, came and argued with him for two hours. He asked Shen Jia to give him some toys to exchange for money, but Shen Jia sternly refused.</p>
<p>Shen Zezhi brought the boss, Wang Fulai, to his nephew's room. That was a few days later. Wang Fulai howled there like a wounded wild boar, cried tears, and destroyed all the objects there -- whether they belonged to him or not. ...</p>
<p>Two months after being fired, the unlucky carpenter Shen Jia went to work as a laborer in a small tin mining company in Guangxi.</p>
<h3>On Issues of New Poetry Creation</h3>
<p>— Lei Shiyu</p>
<p>Recently, the various issues concerning new poetry seem to have been hotly debated in some newspapers, but up to now, no one has made a systematic poetic theory that is concrete and correct on the issues of new poetry creation. Many poetry writers or poets, because of scattered opinions, do not know who is right and who is wrong, and are still doubting the goal of creation and creative activities. In fact, poetry is like novels (of course, different in form and technical expression) and cannot be used as a mechanical form as an unchanging model to call people to imitate. It is nothing more than a literary tool that reflects the consciousness of the era and the reality of society. The era and society are not an egg, so the elements of poetry cannot be analyzed into egg yolk ( ), egg white ( ), eggshell, etc. in certain quantities. Just taking form as an example, the ancient ballad type, the feudal rhythmic type, the capitalist free verse type, and the emerging non-rhythmic type can show how the process of poetry development is changing, just like the changes in history.</p>
<p>Reality is undoubtedly changing, but it is not simply, regularly, and nakedly taken into the laboratory like dissecting a rabbit or analyzing a cup of water's composition. Because just looking at the superficial phenomena and not grasping or deeply understanding the essence of reality containing diversity and complex relationships, it is easy to distort reality. (Of course, there are also people who deliberately distort reality, because exposing the essence of reality is equal to exposing the ugliness and unfortunate fate of his own class.) Therefore, as a progressive poet, attempting to grasp or promote the inevitable trend of history and expressing one's own not "pure" emotions reflected from reality, the correct understanding of the world view, and the tempering of ideology are very necessary. But in order to vividly represent living reality in an artistic image, or to strengthen the emotional impact on the masses, the use of form and technique cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Precisely because the real society is not an unhatched egg (even such an egg changes, but there is no development), the rhythmic types such as jue, lv, and ancient have entered the grave with our queue poets, and the "Hu Shi style" of the gentry bourgeoisie can only exist in the pockets of a few people in suits (but people who wear suits may not all be happy to put the "Hu Shi style" in their pockets), because we now need more concrete, more real, more tragic, and more leaping expressions. At present, how to express it effectively and how to best obtain the method of expression is a topic worthy and urgent discussion.</p>
<p>The masses of China, who are caught in the most miserable life and the most cruel oppression, and whose cultural education is the lowest or non-existent, and all the badge-wearing or non-badge-wearing traitors who shamelessly hold the crutches of imperialism to whip, slaughter, and enslave the masses... are precisely the objects we want to express. At the same time, because we are standing in the layer of the masses, as singers of the masses, we cannot ignore and must study and adapt to the vision and hearing of the masses and pull it blindly.</p>
<p>However, the development of new poetry in the past year or two has been too pessimistic. Not only is there not a single poetry magazine that can be regarded as representative, but there is not even a more progressive one that is regularly published. Even some of the poetry works published in newspapers and literary magazines are mostly disappointing. This does not mean that there are no progressive poets writing poetry. I believe that many useful works have been trampled on. At the same time, because there is no encouragement and opportunity to publish, it affects the pessimism and laziness of many poetry writers. Some poets with a little reputation do not turn to individual activities, do not excavate new poets for the development of the poetry world, and cannot produce good poems if they are separated from the activities of the masses. Therefore, the future and way out of the development of new poetry are becoming increasingly bleak.</p>
<p>However, I do not deny the devastation and embarrassment of politics and economics. In fact, precisely because of this, we must strengthen the struggle more technically and more arduously.</p>

<h3>Germany's Second Bomb</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Since Germany abandoned the Treaty of Versailles and implemented rearmament, it has been like a tiger released from its cage, looking down on everything, causing all European countries to be on guard. But Germany's rearmament was just the first bomb thrown to the world. Now Germany's second bomb is about to explode. Hitler is preparing to demand the return of old colonies and restore armed forces in the Rhineland region. Hitler plans to hold a referendum in April, submitting two questions to the citizens for approval. The questions are: (1) Do the German people need colonies? (2) Is the restoration of armed forces in the Rhineland region consistent with Germany's dignity? This kind of referendum is enough to illustrate Germany's future direction.</p>
<p>In recent years, Germany has never forgotten its previous old colonies. Hitler has made blatant expressions in his speeches in various countries, saying that Germany is unwilling to give up its old colonies forever. Recently, he lectured to students at the National Socialist Party University in Müllre, saying that European countries have the right to colonize overseas, and Germany is now very strong, does not need League of Nations aid, and does not need treaties or alliances. Colonies are obtained by strong power. Germany's determination to strive for colonies can be seen from this. Regarding this request, the Japanese authorities recently declared that there is no reason to return the territories administered by Japan to Germany. I wonder what method Hitler will adopt in the future to demand the return of old colonies. Is it necessary to use strong power to achieve its goal?</p>
<p>As for restoring armed forces in the Rhineland region, according to recent reports from France, Germany has secretly laid out an "air Hindenburg Line" in the area, preparing for a second invasion of France. It is also said that all the most modern airports in the area have underground aircraft shelters that defend against bombs, each room can accommodate a hundred aircraft. The line stretches from the North Sea to the Swiss border. There is also a second line, which is also a similar aircraft field, the location of which is suitable for providing strategic retreat for the first line. Regarding the re-establishment of defenses in the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, Germany not only does not deny it, but has also tried its best to promote it. Now this issue has attracted the attention of France. French Foreign Minister Flandin, who participated in the funeral of the late British monarch, has discussed with British Foreign Secretary Eden how to deal with Germany. Although Britain believes that Germany's move does not pose an immediate danger, it is prepared to assist France in its policy of preparing for emergencies. In addition, Belgium and France are closely dependent on each other, and also expressed sympathy for France's policy. It was also decided to set up defense works along the Muse River, from Liege, which is adjacent to Germany, to the border of France. On the Italian side, former French Prime Minister Laval also contacted him once before resigning. The Italian authorities immediately declared that if Germany violates the terms of the peace treaty, Italy's military strength is sufficient to deal with the incident. As such, the European situation is now in a tense state, and the future is difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<p>Hitler is determined to build the Third Germany, and it has been three years since he came to power. Although Germany itself is becoming increasingly strong, world peace has been greatly threatened.</p>
<h3>On New Year Pictures</h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>During the Lunar New Year, in addition to gathering family members and enjoying family life, people generally have a more important meaning, which is that everyone, in addition to having fun, also wants an auspicious sign to seek happiness and the safety of livestock for the year. It is very clear just to look at the red paper couplets pasted on the gates and rooms of every household. In addition, the various New Year pictures sold in the painting stalls can also be seen from the colors and intentions of the paintings. Mr. Zhitang is very good at talking about New Year pictures. He once used a sarcastic feeling to say that most of these New Year pictures with this kind of meaning are "apotropaic paintings" that carry morality and are a manifestation of the outdated ideas of the literati. Mr. Zhitang's words naturally came from his own feelings, and he did not necessarily sincerely ridicule the simple-minded rural people whose thoughts and lives were very simple. The villagers work hard all year round, and it is not easy to have porridge to drink for two meals a day. They rely on the customs inherited from thousands of years to be able to relax for a few days in the New Year. What they expect is of course to hope that the days will pass more smoothly in the future, that's all.</p>
<p>There is also a Mr. Sun Fuxi who has also written articles on New Year pictures, which are also very interesting. He was originally a painter, and he naturally has his own unique insights when talking about New Year pictures with the feelings of a painter. However, regardless of whether these New Year pictures are elegant art paintings or "apotropaic paintings" that carry morality, they are indeed fresh decorations for the folk Lunar New Year. As for not forgetting to pray for blessings in addition to having fun, the intentions are extremely difficult. The demand for life is originally endowed by human instinct, and the New Year pictures that carry morality are also a kind of call for and expression of the folk's demand for survival. Even if the thoughts are outdated, the original motivation is undeniable.</p>
<p>Speaking of New Year pictures in my hometown, they are not common. Perhaps the reason for this is that the people in my hometown lack a talent for creating their own popular art. For example, in the way of singing operas, the people in my hometown do not have enough scripts for themselves to sing and perform. During the Lunar New Year, the area around the South Gate of the county town is a painting market, but these paintings are completely different from the New Year pictures commonly referred to. They are all beauty paintings and landscape ink paintings that are贩回来from Shanghai. The villagers cannot afford large mirror screen paintings, so they have to seek cheap and good-looking ones, buy one or two and hang them on the walls of their rooms, which is also a kind of fresh wall decoration. It seems that they can appreciate elegant art quite well. However, in terms of seeking auspiciousness, people still have to paste spring couplets during the New Year, and they are pasted in a big and elaborate way. Zhong Kui images are also pasted on the two large door panels, saying that this Zhong Kui portrait is the real New Year picture of the people in my hometown, because there is really no other kind to say besides this. As for the mouse marrying a daughter, there is only a verbal description, and no one is going to paint it for people to see what the scene is like.</p>
<p>When I was a child, although I found the beauty paintings in the painting stalls to be colorful and very beautiful, I could only occasionally stand in front of them and take a look, and I couldn't afford to buy them. Sometimes the ones bought by the adults were hung on the wall early. What is worth mentioning is the woodcut print of the Kitchen God riding a white horse that was挟in the memorial tablet when送灶on the twenty-third day of the twelfth lunar month. There was a wealth-bringing boy following behind. The paper was extremely rough, and the engraving was often blurred and untrue. However, at that time, I already felt it was extremely precious, and I often secretly揭it down and hid it to play with it, although my grandmother had said that without this little white horse, the Kitchen God could not go to heaven, and I could not manage so much.</p>
<p>Regarding New Year pictures, I will not say anything else, but I cannot help but say that the lack of toys for the children in my hometown is a kind of harm to the cultivation and enlightenment of children's interest and wisdom.</p>
<h3>Shelter From the Cold</h3>
<p>— Xin Ye</p>
<p>The sky was still only dimly lit, and there was a sound of shouting in the corridor outside; it was the warden calling the guards to get up.</p>
<p>It was still pitch black in the shed, although a few wisps of gray-white dawn light leaked in through the gaps in the reed mat, but it did not drive away the darkness in the shed after all.</p>
<p>In that crowded shed, four or five hundred poor people lay horizontally and vertically, all crowded on the spread straw like a group of piglets, and an unpleasant smell followed a burst of snoring and酝酿in the shed.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes in a dark corner and looked around, only to see that the bald head not far from me had been coughing and spitting phlegm all night until dawn. Those young people often woke up from their dreams and muttered to him:</p>
<p>"Why does such an old man still want to live in this world?"</p>
<p>Listening to the sounds outside, they were more noisy than just now. I knew that this group of guards had already gone "to work." Because I really couldn't sleep anymore, I supported a stiff body and crawled out of a quilt with more than a dozen holes. I looked at the guy lying at my feet, but he was still sleeping like a dead pig. I kicked him a few times vigorously, but he didn't wake up.</p>
<p>Last night's cold劲was really terrible. My body had not been warm all night, and the guy lying at my feet was also naughty, turning over for a while and urinating a little, which was really annoying. I will never share the quilt with him again tonight—but the rattan sticks of those guards are really unbearable.</p>
<p>As soon as I mentioned those guards, I got angry; they had a piece of red cloth wrapped around their arms and a rattan stick in their hands, posing like hillbillies from the Northern Grand Sword Team. In fact, they are just monkeys in official positions, and they don't come from the same background as us. Poor people, we are all poor people, why be so snobbish! Anyway, they just have a few pounds of strength and are a few years younger. If my father was ten years younger, he would rather starve to death than come to this hellish place to suffer.</p>
<p>According to my temper, I really want to twist these little turtles and beat them up to teach them a lesson so that I can let out a breath of stink, but it won't work. There are many of them, and the wardens will kick me out.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, I needed to urinate, so I touched the dark wall and stood up, straddling over one person lying down. Sometimes I stepped on their bodies and had to let them curse a few words:</p>
<p>"You're going to die, are you blind?" I can't ignore them.</p>
<p>The shed gradually brightened up, and the footsteps under the eaves began to get busy. One by one, the companions lying on the straw also sat up.</p>
<p>"Go wash your face!" The jailer-like guard shouted, sticking his head in the door, so everyone staggered and swarmed into a courtyard.</p>
<p>Under the reed shed in the middle of the courtyard, there were three wooden buckets of hot water. Many people rushed to wash their faces. The young and strong squeezed in front, while the old, weak, and children were轧落behind. By the time they had all washed, it was our turn, the elderly. Therefore, every time I went to wash, the water had turned into mud, and the cloth was black. It was cold and dirty, and I really didn't want to say it. However, I couldn't help but wash it, or the managing gentlemen would scold me for not understanding hygiene.</p>
<p>After washing our faces, it was time for breakfast; everyone gathered under the porch waiting, and on each gray-green face, there was a kind of hunger shining!</p>
<p>As usual, breakfast in the first shed was eaten first—it was always like this—at this time, a gust of congee fragrance followed the northwest wind, making us all gulp and swallow saliva as we stood there; it felt as if there were small insects crawling in our throats, which made us feel very uncomfortable. I only hoped that the congee would be sent over soon so that we could fill the emptiness in our stomachs.</p>
<p>After each of the six large wooden buckets of congee was sent to us, it would be抢得精光in a few minutes. Although it was just salted radish and thin rice porridge, it was even more rare than white rice and a big wine banquet when we ate it.</p>
<p>After eating breakfast, we still went to the籩子里to lie down or sit and wait for lunch.</p>
<h3>River Dredging</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yan</p>
<p>In winter, when the tides are low, the key point of this official road—under the drawbridge outside the city—is often crowded with boats coming and going. The semi-dried up river water allows for a clear view of the silt and stones at the bottom of the river; while the riverbanks along both sides, accumulated with years of dumped garbage, make the river channel appear even narrower. Every day around noon, boats from Sifen Township to the county seat, or from the county seat to the surrounding villages, must pass through this crucial center, under the drawbridge; but the shallow and narrow river channel blocks them. If the boats coming from behind refuse to give way, everyone insists on going head-to-head, and often the boats cannot move an inch. The noisy arguments then attract the attention of pedestrians on the drawbridge.</p>
<p>This situation reached the ears of the gentry elders, and they informally discussed this matter at a dinner table. Originally, this official road was scheduled to have the river dredged every five years, presided over by the elder of the year (naturally also one of the gentry elders), who would formally convene a meeting. After everyone agreed, donation books would be distributed door-to-door to collect money. The leading gentry elders would have tens of dollars listed next to their names on the first page, making it embarrassing for larger shops and middle-to-upper-class people to write down amounts that were too small. Thus, each elder in charge could earn a special fee on this official road to spend on prostitutes.</p>
<p>However, it was not yet the scheduled time for the five-year dredging. As a result of the informal negotiation, everyone ostensibly expounded on grand arguments under the major themes of "facilitating transportation and maintaining commerce." The county magistrate's uncle, whom everyone called Master Zhong, and who was also the host of this "dinner table" gathering, said with a smile and seriousness that the market was currently sluggish, and it was already difficult to ask businesses to donate money once every five years. Only two years had passed since the last dredging. Although they knew the river's traffic had a close relationship with their business, it might not be easy to ask businesses to share this unexpected dredging donation at the end of the year? Finally, he got to the point, suggesting he try to obtain a sum of public funds from the county, and that the gentry elders also donate a little more. "This is doing a good deed!" Master Zhong smiled like a heron.</p>
<p>This proposal won much applause and flattering words at the "dinner table." Master Zhong was very pleased with his handling of this matter. Because if he went to the county to obtain public funds, he could naturally preside over this extra dredging, and a sum of "Tang Pool" money would surely be in his hands. But the gentry elders were no more foolish than Master Zhong. Everyone wanted to compete with all their might to be the host of this dredging. However, none of them had the connections to obtain public funds from the county. Therefore, on one hand, they agreed with Master Zhong's proposal, letting him focus on obtaining public funds. After leaving Master Zhong's house, they formed a group and held another meeting. Their defensive method was to contact the foremen of private construction teams first, setting a trap for Master Zhong to fall into, and then they would jointly sign their names</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>to start dredging the river.</p>
<p>Relying on his nephew's (county magistrate) influence, the public funds were successfully obtained. Master Zhong naturally prepared another banquet to entertain the gentry elders. At the banquet, Master Zhong used diplomatic tactics to win them over. On the surface, everyone supported Master Zhong as the host of this dredging. The next day, a tender notice was posted in the city.</p>
<p>As the end of the year approached, the official river was a crucial thoroughfare. Master Zhong advocated for damming the river first. The tender could be concluded and construction could start immediately after three days. However, after the second three-day period passed, there were still no bids. The county immediately received a joint official letter from various businesses, which was naturally unfavorable to Master Zhong. Although Master Zhong ran to the county magistrate's house several times, the gentry elders still came to handle the dredging matters themselves.</p>
<p>When the river dredging started on the first day, the gentry elders all came to the city early in the morning to watch. Their smiles were so full under the sunlight, although some still secretly thought of ways to reduce their contributions, so that they could earn a little extra money for themselves.</p>

<h3>A Visit to Chiba Shoyu Business in Japan (6)</h3>
<p>— (Ye Xiyuan)</p>
<p>Yamasa Shoyu Company is located in Choshi Town, in the northeast of Chiba Prefecture. It is famous in Japan for brewing Yamasa soy sauce. Its capital is ten million yen, its total land area is 65,000 tsubo, its total building area is 35,000 tsubo, its annual output is 250,000 koku, it has 150 office employees, and 1,700 workers. It has three brewing factories, all in Choshi Town, Chiba Prefecture. Except for the first factory, which is an old-style factory building, the second and third factories are newly built and can compete with Noda's 17th factory. Its market covers not only Japan, Korea, and Manchuria, but also Europe and America.</p>
<p>Choshi Shoyu Co., Ltd. is located in Choshi Town, Chiba Prefecture. It is considered a relatively latecomer in the Japanese soy sauce brewing industry. It has a capital of five million yen and an annual soy sauce production of more than 150,000 koku. It has five brewing factories. Its fifth factory is the newest building. When we visited, it was not yet completed and required more than one million yen in construction costs. Although the scale is smaller than Noda and Yamasa, its organizational soundness, management innovation, and business efforts are probably above Noda and Yamasa. Its managing director, Mr. Hamaguchi Rinzo, is young, handsome, and ambitious, and he is greatly admired by us.</p>

<p>Temptation (Written by Liu Yawei) (3)</p>
<p>Little Lu: What did they say?</p>
<p>Eldest Brother: They said that the flood came very quickly, submerging seven or eight villages in one night. They originally lived on the border of Shang County. Now their homes have all been flooded, so they fled here overnight yesterday.</p>
<p>A Qiao: (Surprised) Oh dear! We are on the border of this county, aren't we very dangerous?</p>
<p>Eldest Brother: If it weren't dangerous, why would I be worried? Little Lu: So what do we do? Let's run away quickly!</p>
<p>Eldest Brother: Run away? Where to? Running is starving to death! Not running is drowning to death! Either way it's death!</p>
<p>A Qiao: Isn't there disaster relief coming to distribute grain? Besides, we still have half a bucket of rice!</p>
<p>Eldest Brother: That's right, but when will they come to distribute it? Not to mention the money donated, even if it's all distributed, how much is enough for several counties of people? You'll definitely be squeezed! Will you have a share? As for this mere half bucket of rice, if it can support our family, would you not help others when they are starving to death? In that case, isn't danger coming immediately?</p>
<p>Little Lu: Then why are those relief people like that?</p>
<p>Eldest Brother: For the sake of face, they have to pretend to make a trip to maintain face. As for their conscience, whether it has been eaten by dogs, I don't know.</p>
<p>A Qiao: Then why is that? Don't they also have human hearts made of flesh?</p>
<p>Eldest Brother: (Smiling) Because they themselves need to live better lives! What does it matter to them whether you starve to death!</p>
<p>Old Fifth: (Anxiously) Damn it, they only know how to eat their fill and collect rent. They don't even repair the embankments when they break. If the flood really comes, won't they also drown or flee?</p>
<p>Eldest Brother: They got the news long ago that the embankments wouldn't be repaired. Don't they know the danger themselves? Let me tell you, they won't be among those who drown!</p>
<p>Little Lu: So, what do you say we should do? Should we run away first?</p>
<p>Eldest Brother: Didn't I tell you? Running is death, not running is also death!</p>
<p>A Qiao: What can we do? Only death awaits. (About to cry)</p>

<p>Opening "Lantern Festival"</p>
<p>What is the most moving thing about the Lantern Festival? Only to hear the deafening sound of drums. The Gregorian calendar's Lantern Festival is silent. The lunar calendar's Lantern Festival is bustling. But only see, red men and green women chasing each other. Startled couples whispering sister and brother. Only see that, a piece of spring sunshine is warm. Gentle breeze blowing with warbling orioles. In a blink of an eye, the willow banks and green willows make people feel refreshed. Prosperous city shining in spring. And only see, the thoroughfare surging with flying skirts and clogs. Lantern colors shining in five colors. But only hear that, strings and songs are like pearls. Silver flowers bursting like buds, the moon is three watches old. Jade leaks stop urging, dust horses go. Neon clothes press songs, praising peace. You don't see, now the old story spreads that the city never sleeps. Shangyuan is beautiful today. Rich and magnificent, competing for treasures. It is a pity that it wastes money and spirit. Just those, emerald sleeves fluttering, fragrant and rich. Intoxicating and smiling. Stars first enter the human world to shine. Fire trees cover the sky, shocking. At this moment, poets seek rhyme with extra interest. Scholars ponder short comments. Just those, desolate villages accompany wild paths. No mood to face the cold police. Although, ninety days of spring begin on this day. But alas, the country is troubled by fierce struggles. I want to be silent and lead my feelings away. Secretly learn from Nanyang to cultivate in the fields. With a fishing rod to pass the time, fishing in the clear water.</p>

<p>Opening "Palace Complaint"</p>
<p>West Palace night is quiet, straight fragrance. Want to roll the bead curtain, spring hate is long. Noble concubine alone sitting on a sandalwood couch. High burning red candles waiting for the king. Gao Lishi. Enlighten the maiden. Saying that tonight the emperor fell in Zhaoyang. Jade Ring heard and added sadness. Softly resigned to unload palace makeup. Sleeping upside down on the dragon bed. Short sigh, long sigh, tears in two lines. See that, a round of bright moon shining on the palace wall. Thinking of Consort Mei, what a beautiful appearance. Why did you leave me halfway? Quilt is cold. Pillow is cold. Expect to think of a dream. You are also a heartless man. Advise the world, never accompany the emperor. Accompanying the emperor is like accompanying a tiger and a wolf. It is better to marry a romantic son. Enjoying happiness morning and night.

<h3>"Broken Dreams of Spring" Opens in Paris</h3>
<p>The film "Broken Dreams of Spring," which won the top prize at the 3rd film festival held in Italy last year, is MGM's supreme structure. The film is based on Tolstoy's famous Russian work, and is a great achievement of Greta Garbo and Frederic March's first joint performance, as well as the six major stars such as Basil Rathbone, the child star of "David Copperfield," breaking New York's box office record in six years. From today on, it will be shown at the Paris Theater on Avenue Joffre. Those who want to appreciate Garbo's work, please do not miss it.</p>
<h3>Yuan Meiyun Shaves Her Head to Be a Man</h3>
<p>A surprising piece of news is that Yuan Meiyun held a head-shaving ceremony last night. However, this was not a head-shaving ceremony at the time of the baby's full moon, nor was it a head-shaving ceremony for becoming a nun, but a head-shaving ceremony in which a woman turned into a man in the movie "Incarnation Girl" directed by Fang Peilin and produced by Yihua Company. In the "click" of the camera sound and the "clack-clack" of the barber Mou Li's scissors, it was as if her heart was being cut, and it was obvious that her two watery eyes were filled with glittering teardrops. She stared blankly at the long black hair scattered on the ground, but her expression was not sad. Instead, she seemed to have infinite pleasure in her heart.</p>
<p>Yes, why did Yuan Meiyun have to cut off her hair? What kind of role does she play in "Incarnation Girl"? This mysterious and subtle mystery can only be answered by everyone themselves from "Incarnation Girl".</p>

<h3>The Experimental Theater Group Revives and Prepares for its Second Performance</h3>
<p>The Experimental Theater Group, which was born from the Experimental Performance Institute, since participating in the flood relief fundraising concert and holding its first performance of "The Miser," has been brewing the air for a second performance. The group was temporarily suspended because the central figures flew away midway. Recently, Lu Shi, Liu Yawei, Pan Gongliang, Lu Yi, etc., were responsible for preparing to realize the hope of the second performance, and with the help of Huang Jingwan, Xia Chun, and other strengths, the work was progressing smoothly. It is heard that the scripts have been selected as "Meiluo Xiang" and "The Last Prayer," and the participating authors also include Zuo Ming, Mei Xi, Zhao Manna, Liu Liying and new recruit Ma Yuandeng.</p>
<h3>Yue Feng's New Work "Little Tiger"</h3>
<p>Yue Feng's new work after "Wedding Night". The script is being actively written, and it will be completed soon. The title is set as "Little Tiger". It is a moral and human drama full of detective flavor. It is said that the whole play will focus on relaxation and tension, and the play needs one hundred little fat actors around the age of sixteen or seventeen.</p>
<h3>A Major Innovation in the Yisheng Film Monthly</h3>
<p>The Yisheng Film Monthly has been published for six issues. It has always been known for its beautiful shape and quality materials. It has a very high position in film publications. Last year, Chen Jiazhen, the editor of the magazine, suddenly suffered from hemoptysis and was plagued for a long time, which caused the publication of Yisheng to be delayed. Now, Mr. Chen's physical strength has recovered, and he is determined to reorganize and improve the content with the greatest effort. He has also decided on the future editorial policy, restoring the music special group, adding a reader's mailbox, and introducing new knowledge and new families. The material should be rich, the form should be beautiful, the compilation should be eye-catching, and the style should be unique, so as to add a different color to the Chinese publishing industry. Also, because the original address is not enough, it has now been moved to No. 457 Hankou Road. All subscriptions or letters should be sent to the new address.</p>
