<p>— 守拙</p>
<p>平地泉是綏東的重心</p>
<p>記者於八月間一國防前綫之綏遠」通訊中，曾經的略說過綏遠地勢的重要，以及最近的危機，幷且預料不久的將來敵人必定有更大的進攻，所以綏遠表面上雖暫時比較的安謐，實際裏則危險萬狀，不料時隔兩月，預言竟成實事，匪軍在張北商都方面的準備，幕後人在平綏路上的來來往往，看來大有一觸卽發之勢，眼見我們的綏東免不了再受一次猛烈的襲擊，而且这次襲擊此以前更要凶惡，这次襲擊的意義比以前更要嚴重，這是我們全國國民所應當注意的。</p>
<p>侵擾綏東祗不過是一個大計劃中的一步，他的最大意義是要把察哈爾·綏遠·寗夏·甘肅•以至新疆，聯成一綫，然後《方面可以對俄作戰，一方面可以控制華北，和中國全部的西北，我們從歷史上看，這綏遠內蒙一帶和整個中國有很重大的意義，譬如秦始皇就以內蒙作威懾匈奴的根基，漢武帝亦用以控制邊塞，唐時更用以降服突厥回紇，以底定西北，滿淸則更進一步以滿蒙為基礎，入主中原，可見這一帶地勢對於國家興亡的重要，所以綏遠的存亡，不僅是國土的得失，實是全國民族復興機會的得失關頭，我們將如何用全國的力量去保守呢。</p>
<p>綏束五縣，就是興和•豐鎭·凉城•陶林和集寗•（卽平地泉），其中最前綫是陶林和興和，平地泉和豐鎭是第二綫，凉城係在最後，因為平地泉和豐鎭是在平綏鐵路上，所以比較其他三縣更重要，而平地泉又因為軍事交通經濟三方面的關係，更可說是綏束的重心。</p>
<p>（一）就軍事上說，綏東一帶地勢大都平坦，無險可守，惟有陶林到平地泉一段是高原，（平地泉高一千四百公尺為平綏路最高的地方，居高臨下，易守難攻，我們仍若能够防住這一段，那末進可以戰，退亦可憑險堅守，否則陶林有失，歸綏危急，平地泉有失，後方接濟斷絕，所以我們要守綏遠，必要守緩東，要守綏束，必要防住這平地泉一段。</p>
<p>（二）就交通上說，平地泉是綏遠山西二省交通上的要隘，平地泉到大同是晋綏唯一的軍事交通錢，此路一斷，綏遠就可立卽陷於孤立地位，與外界斷絕一切聯絡和接濟，這是敵人必取的策略，而綏遠的能吾保持，就要看我們能吾維持這一方的交通。</p>
<p>（三）就經濟上說，平地泉是綏遠全省糧食集中地點，全城糧店可四十家其他商業亦因之極為發達，中國銀行交通銀行均有分行，放欵共計有四五十萬元之多，橋東橋西兩處市集，十分熱鬧，可說是綏遠全省最富庶的地方，也是綏東後方接濟之唯一的重心，此地如若有失，後方接濟立卽斷絕，此地倘為敵方佔領，反可接濟敵人，增加其侵略力量，平地泉在綏東後方接濟上，可說是一個最要的重心。</p>
<p>平地泉在軍事交通經濟上的重要，已如上述，敵人對於平地泉也是非常注意，自從熱河失陷，察北被佔以後，敵人處心積慮，要想打通熱察綏三省，連為一氣，築成鐵道，最近從赤峯到多倫的輕便鐵道，巳可通車，從多倫到張北一段，早已開工，從張北到商都一段，亦正在計劃，將來卽擬從商都接到平地泉，以與平綏鐵路銜接，那末將來無論軍事方面經濟方面，都可控制三省，進而控制西北，敵人西進的策略，亦以平地泉為着眼點，更可見得平地泉的重要。</p>
<p>據現勢推測，綏東的戰事遲早總是難免，綏東戰事的勝敗，影響於綏察晋及內外蒙古，更影響於整個的西北，更影響於整個民族復興，現在綏東方面的軍事負責當局，如綏省主席傳作義，一百二十八旅旅長曾延毅，（原任綏束剿匪司令）綏東四旗達密凌蘇龍總管，大同騎兵司令趙承綬，都是抱著守士决心的人，但是在實力上要抵抗一個有大準備的侵略，似乎還嫌不足，我們希望察綏晋三省聯合起來，把三省的全力維護綏東，再希望中央把政府的力量來接濟三省的一切需要，更希望全國國民，要用全體所有的力量做前綫的後盾。</p>

<h3 id="c60">物價飛漲之觀察 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>近半月來，紗花市塲。變化又烈。去年同時。曾為幣制改革之風聲。狂漲而停板。今年此日。又以棉紗連漲八元餘而停拍。說者謂今年之漲與去年不同。去年此時。幣制改革尙未見諸事實。故其漲為虛。今年之漲。正為幣制改革成功之明證。故為實。一虛一實。其間相差不可以道里計。但本年物價本尙安定。惟因投機集中於紗花粉麥市塲。波浪掀騰。較為熱烈。本月以來。遂以現貨缺乏客銷發動。接二連三上昇不已。線價允為堅昂。一漲十餘元。本色布疋幾致銷售一空。昨晨標紗開盤一躍十元。是誠市塲中罕有之舉動也。</p>
<p>然物價之飛速上升。亦非全由於現貨之缺乏。推原其故。的有數端。一則自幣制改革之後。物價理應有上騰之反映。不然則改革幣制為無意義。當幣制改革之初。商品雖亦有漲價。而以外幣計算之貨物。尙不乏有存貨可售。所漲尙微。經此一年來之久。積貨已罄。現所銷者已多半為成本較高之貨品。售價因之上漲。洋貨旣貴。土貨自亦為所刺激。二則日美對於我國農產品。需求尙殷尤其為日本。駐軍於東北平津各地。積草囤糧。為求軍需之充牣。買麥儲棉。以應工業之需求。遂致棉麥之價。堅昂不衰。三則油豆自經大述日商之操縱。較之去年所漲幾倍。因之今年豆價無一不貴。一方面米穀旣告豐登。洋米亦少進口。粤閩所決之糧。集中於皖湘採辦。米價得以維持而不敝。四則今年各地平均收成。雖無可靠之估計作依據。大致當屬良好。而價格又高。農民收入精裕。對於商品。需求自殷。而在工商業。鑒於歷年市面萎靡。銷路不振。减工停機。不欲多所存積。及一旦需要驟來。無以應之。價乃飛漲。五則一般富有者之心理改變。買黃金囤貨物。求壟斷而登之。以左右望。而罔市利。六則投機家見有機之可乘。大肆活躍。翻多拋空。期遂其大慾。於是而有今日之市面。</p>
<p>物價上漲。農夫稱慶。工商沾利。似我國經濟有復興之望矣。但當注意者。幣値與物價之消長。當恰如其量。增過於减則失其效用。此其一。中國為洋貨傾銷之尾閭。物價過高。易於引誘洋貨之大量輸人。此其二紡織工業。卽就國內而言。亦漸成喧賓奪主之勢。若不察利害。狂漲猛抬。徒為他人造機會。允為不値。此其三。最可慮者漲度過速。盈朒甚鉅設有一方不支。影響可以立見。况所謂現貨缺乏。若非全由於實銷發動。而有居奇待賈之色彩。則反動之來。勢更猛烈。市面震動。危險孰甚。此其四。邇來蔬菜魚肉。無一不貴。若竟為米珠薪桂。使一般薪工階級。引起生活上之要求。則又糾紛多事矣。此其五由上以觀。近日物價之上漲。尙含不少可憂之因素。决非吾人所可過分樂蜆者也。</p>

<h3 id="c118">紗館轉暢價格狂漲　上海存紗行將千罄　各廠暨交易所倉庫祇二萬包　現紗高過標準紗價實為罕見　紗廠開日夜工趕紡棉價亦堅 <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>我國各地紗銷轉暢後、價格狂漲、上海各廠暨交易所倉庫存紗、行將吿罄、總共不過二萬包、各廠開日夜工趕紡、棉花雖値豐收、因紗漲亦堅、新聲社記者昨向紗業界探得詳情、分誌如下、</p>
<p>紗銷突暢</p>
<p>紗銷轉暢原因、（一）我國各地農產品豐收、人民購紗力量增高、且係普遍現象、各帮皆鉅量購進、以致紗銷不斷、（二）過去天津漢口兩處紗廠停工者甚多且久、同時上海各廠均一致减工、以致生產减少、供給數量、隨之而减、（三）江蘇內地織布業轉佳、各布廠均告獲利、所以多購原料（四）華北紗銷已久不動、今突大好、</p>
<p>紗價飛漲</p>
<p>昨日十月期標準紗價最高為二百三十八元、近一週間、漲起二十元之鉅、向來紗價、近期低而遠期高、相差的十元、現在則相反、近期較遠期高的十五元、此為市價實際堅固之現象、並非投機之漲風、目前標準紗漲勢依然甚烈、但尙未超過民國十八年之高峯、彼時為一百八十三兩、而目前缺貨現象、較彼時為甚、</p>
<p>存紗減少</p>
<p>上海存紗、過去恒在十萬包以上、今年夏季减至五萬包左右、秋季後再减、至目前截止、總的二萬包、（包括交易所倉庫存紗）至於交易所倉庫存紗、今年最多為七月二十四日、計三萬六千八百九十包、逐漸减少、至七月三十日為三萬六千三百三十五包、八月三十日為三萬三千三百四十五包、九月三十日為二萬二千零二十包、十月十九日為七千四百十包、</p>
<p>各廠趕紡</p>
<p>上海各紗廠存紗均將吿罄、各戶囤紗量增加、並因現紗缺乏、漲價甚猛、已超過標準紗十餘元之鉅、為過去罕有現象、過去一二月間、現紗銷好、市價漸漲、而交易所因時局關係、拋空者多、最近時局轉緩和、拋空者减少、因此紗亦狂漲、華商各紗廠、均已開日夜班紡紗、因照目前價格、紡成之紗、均能獲利、至於停工之廠、如申新第二第五兩廠、已得中國上海兩銀行之恊助、整理機件、準備開工、</p>
<p>花價亦堅</p>
<p>今年我國各地棉花、雖値豐收、其棉花價格、因紗漲亦堅、不過最近一期間、總以紗漲大而花漲小、過去花貴紗賤之現象、漸在轉變之中、但距過去紗花差價常數仍遠、</p>

<h3 id="c170">家庭訪問與主婦責任 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>訪問家庭主婦，是國貨運動之最緊要工作，現在上海市國貨運動聯合會已經實行了三星期，訪問的人家，已有五百三十家。諸女士這種不厭不倦的精神，與循循善誘的態度，是很值得敬佩的。可是訪問時候，受盡奚落，遭盡揶揄，有時或見屏於門丁，有時或見辱於傭僕，甚至備受太太奶奶的冷待。可是她們一些不灰心，不消極，依然進行她們應做的工作。</p>
<p>門丁傭僕，乃至老嫗婢女，沒有受過敎育，不知什麽國家的可愛不可愛，國貨和非國貨，他們只知狐假虎威，在廚房裏在僕役室中，作威作福，不要說別的，卽使亡了國，他們依然是做人家的奴隸，他們的心目中，還知什麽國貨，他們的腦海中，還有什麽國貨。吾們不必去怪他們，還要哀憐他們，可惜他們，太沒有知識，太缺乏人氣，所以不必責望他們，怨恨他們。</p>
<p>可是做了主婦的太太或少奶奶，似乎太忘了自己的身分，你們明明是中國人，　應甩中國的貨，為什麽歡喜用外貨？為什麼做事沒有恒心？為什麽把國貨不放在眼裏，而儘量的貪圖眼前快樂，用那非國貨的物品。等到女訪問員到家，還要擺出架子來，做出標勁來，不是說沒有工夫見客，便是說不願與人談話，這種情形，似乎太無血氣，太無熱情。吾人老實告訴你們罷：</p>
<p>這訪問員工作，一半固然是為了國貨工廠，一半也是為了這般主婦們。使你們有所諮詢，徵求你們對於國貨的意見，探求你們服用上的戚想，卽就五百三十家主婦發表的意見，該會已請國貨工廠切實改進，以求滿足許多主婦的期望。記得有幾個主婦承認國貨很好，、不過價格不便宜。有幾個主婦買東西都到國貨公司去，可是尚覺店員服務太不注意禮貌。這般女訪問員，都已為主婦們一一告訴會中，商量改進。所以你們不說則已，你們說出來的意見，一般國貨廠商，都願采納的。這種很好發表意見的機會，眞是求之不得，為什麽走上門來，反訑訑然拒人於千里之外？這樣看來，上海地方，何嘗是文明，何嘗是開化，何嘗知有愛國，何嘗有熱心士女。主婦如此，小孩可知，傭僕可知。吾今正告主婦們：從今以後，有女訪問員到門，要誠誠懇懇的接待，眞眞摯摯的商量，心中所不滿於國貨的，固然要發表出來，向來所欽佩國貨的，也要說出來，使生產者與消費者之溝通，呼成一氣，國貨事業，才有希望。</p>
<h3 id="c171">安樂毛羢紡織廠一瞥 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 振聲</p>
<p>衣着為人類日常生活中重要的部門，卽以毛絨綫一項而言：以前像「蜜蜂牌」幾乎把住了中國毛絨市塲，竟有一百二十餘年的歷史，占進口毛絨百份之九十，每年的漏巵又何止數千萬？「涓涓不塞，勢成江河」，眞是一筆極大的損失！近年國內實業家，鑒於非提倡國貨，實不足以言救國，先後創辦範圍較大的毛絨廠，如上海的章華，安樂，天津的海京等三四家，經他們努力改良，和同胞熱烈提倡，已能挽回一部鉅大的利權。卽以安樂毛絨紡織廠而言：以前所出的「美人牌」「金錢牌」，久已風行全國，今年更新出一種「英雄牌」特等絨綫，所含的纖維特長，經久耐穿，可以穿污了再結，結好了再穿，雖五六次之多，也毫無損傷，較之舶來品價廉物美，有過之而無不及，這「英雄牌」的出現，直接是為了抵制「蜜蜂牌」的傾銷，使得牠將來絕跡於國貨市塲。</p>
<p>在一個天高氣爽雲淡風輕的下午，作者承鄧仲和先生之邀，曾前往巡禮一次，廠址在白利南路三十四號，建築相當的富麗，由王廠畏親自引導，報告該廠的歷史，及產銷情形，，依次「拉毛，整理，分股，打紋，包紥，裝箱，」「上漿，紡織，」「漂洗，染色，洪毛，」等紡，織，染三大工程的全部據王君說：當一二八滬戰以後，上海市面極度不景氣安樂經一年的籌備居然不顧一切的開幕了，大家拘着犧牲精神，埋頭苦幹，掙扎奮鬥了五個年頭，差幸還沒有受到「不景氣」的波及，奠定始基，資金由一百萬元，增加到一百一十萬元，現在營業，還在一日千里的進展着。全廠有紡織機二三十架，布機數百張，全體工作人員的近千人，原料的收集，國內是向江浙兩省，及山東，天津，關內外，一帶羊毛出產地採取，國外是派員向西比利亞，澳洲購來，今年新出的「英雄牌」銷路很好成績驚人，以前的甲種「美女牌」，乙種「金錢牌」，四六股毛絨綫，則已供不應求，行銷遍全國各行省，卽邊遠省份，及南洋羣島，亦有大批購買，但他們並不自滿，現正計劃添建廠房，增購機器，擴充範圍，直到外貨絕跡，國貨抬頭為止，這種復興國產致力實業的精神，該是多麽的令人欽佩！</p>
<h3 id="c172">展期聲中的　市商會國貨展覽會 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 勝</p>
<p>（特寫）聽說市商會主辦的國貨展覽會，已經展期了，就趕快去作了一回巡禮。這幾天秋高氣爽，展覽會塲，好不熱鬧，還有友邦的士女，也隨着我們，踴進踴出，像秋潮又像秋雲似的。首先發生一點感想，就是貿易雖有國界，主要點却在貨品的精良與價格的稱意，何况這邊集着國內第一流的工廠，羅列着國內第一流的產品呢。</p>
<p>我們覺得驚異，又覺得欣喜，像亞浦耳電器廠的燈泡，安眠思床墊廠的沙發和軟墊，不斷地圍着一簇一簇的外國主顧，很樂用似的購買，</p>
<p>玩具的製迭可以左右兒童思想，誰都知道，可是我們國貨中的康元廠玩具。眞是玲瓏精巧之至，像「升綫猴「廻輪汽車」，誰都看得中的。</p>
<p>我國的新藥事業，近年頗有後來居上趨勢，這次參加展覽會的新亞藥廠及中法中西兩藥房，都得到一般的注意，聞在塲業務，均稱滿意，而外國藥廠的駐滬代表，也頻來致詞，尤其對於新亞出品，表示不可言狀的欽佩。</p>
<p>在會塲中，碰着了一位名藝術家，他在審察看各廠的陳設精神與配色美化，他又力贊益豐搪瓷廠，華成烟公司，華生電器廠，泰康餅乾廠，虎標永安堂的陳設，說是很常於美化和美感。</p>
<p>會塲的前部，集着著名的九大工廠，就是中國化學工業社，美亞織綢廠，中華琺瑯廠，華福製帽廠，五和織造廠，鴻新染織廠，亞光電木廠，中華第一針織廠，一心牙刷廠，這九家工廠，在上海或者擴大底言在中國，播種着今日國貨繁榮的種子，當「九一八」北事變的次年，他們聯台起來，大膽地在外貨尾閭下的南京路上，舉行着一次最有組織有精神的九廠國貨商塲，現在雄據着南京路上的中國國貨公司，也是從道九廠中胚胎出來的哩。</p>
<p>最後我們覺得發起這次展覽會的市商會商品陳列館，確定上海國貨活動的大本營，他們具着十五年奮鬥的精神，抱着不斷努力的决心，昨天參加展覽的各大工廠，特聯合製成四方匾額，並舉行一個贈匾典禮，慰勞展覽會會長王曉箱與副會長許曉初兩先生，我們知道匾額雖是舊社會組織中的一種紀念品，但是將來懸掛在陳列所內，到是在歷史上却含着重大的意義咧。</p>

<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>魯迅先生之死，是中國文壇巨星的殞落，是文化界喪失了一位戰士：我們站在同文的立塲，不能不致萬分的悲悼！雖然我個人和魯迅先生，僅不過一面之緣，論起私交，眞够不上說話。但，無論他的撰著，繙譯，纂輯，校訂，或是主編的書籍，十幾年來，也總算讀了不少；他那種學者的風度，思想的高超；與努力文化運動的功續；在在使人歎服，值得歌頌的。當他晚年的時候，依然具有一貫的精神，從事於著作，不像一般人過了中年，便意志消沉，文思衰退，所以他能抓得無數讀者的信仰，散佈文學革命的種子，在近幾年尤其國難以後，由他的著作發生的力量，很有勁氣，更能博得靑年大衆的同情，確是他的特長。在中國當代文豪中，可算第一人！</p>
<p>常言道：「文人無行」，因此社會上對於一般所謂文人，簡直看得藐乎其小，魯迅先生獨能人醉我醒，人濁我淸，秉着堅貞不移的心志，評私人，論國事，都有他中心的主張，是者是，非者非，這種大公無私不折不撓的精神，也值得做我們文人的典範。現在，中國的聰明人太多，惟獨講是非，論公道，有骨幹的人眞少，我在哀悼魯迅先生之餘，所最感悲懷的。</p>
<h3 id="c176">敬悼魯迅先生 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 沸</p>
<p>魯迅先生的創作事業，不僅在中國，而是在世界，巳早有定評，我們不必再加贊美。但魯迅先生的偉大，應該不僅是在他的祟高無比的作品，芷確的反映了我們的時代，將成為永遠不朽的著作，而是在他一生中以他一往直前永不後退，　「對於生的堅强，對於死的掙扎」（他在「生死塲」序文中語）永遠剛毅不屈，和一切舊勢力惡勢力作頑强的鬭爭，永遠站在時代的最前綫，為我們新的社會，新的人類而作猛烈戰鬭的偉大鬭士的精神。這樣一個偉大的時代戰士，從他的「狂人日記」「阿Q正傳」的發表，直到最近的參加於救亡陣綫，他的戰鬭歷史，從未有一刻暗淡過。鮮明而光亮的戰跡，貫串於他的全生涯中，成為我們前進文化陣綫唯一的領導者。今日對於這樣一個偉大戰士的突然死去，給予我們廣大靑年，社會羣衆，實是一個難以補償太大的損失！從今以後，我們再不能看到，聽到這位文化前進陣綫領導者的可寳貴的敎訓的了！</p>
<p>從辛亥革到最近的救亡命運動為止，給予我們文化上靑年思想上最大影響的，辛亥革命前是梁啟超先生，五四一時代是胡適先生，從五四經過五卅到最近為魯迅先生，無疑是直接間接支配着整個文化前進陣綫，廣大靑年羣衆思想的唯一的巨人！多少時代的戰士們，在半途退却了，而唯有魯迅先生，永遠未嘗一刻後退過，為新的社會新的人類而領導着更多後來的靑年作猛烈的戰鬭！他應該是我們這一時代無比的最大的巨人，這在歷史上是一定被確定着無疑的</p>
<p>再以萬分悲傷的心哀悼着我們文化戰綫唯一領導者的魯迅先生以後，讓我們就接受了他遺留下來可寳貴的遺產，步着他的後塵，為新的社會新的人類而作更勇敢的戰鬭罷！</p>

<p>在現在，舊有的一切，似乎都告了落位，只有「才子」，却還顛撲不破的受着人們的崇拜，敬愛，頌揚。試看：留着一頭長髮，囚首垢面，不修邊幅的那些詩人們，作家們，藝人們，不是到處在受着人們的歡迎嗎？那末，我們這位號稱「東門才子「的郭先生，也做了一世的才子，着實足以驕傲人的了。</p>
<p>郭先生是前淸的一位「秀才」，但他得到才子的雅稱，並不是為進了秀才之故，是為他常在街頭高聲地讀着他自己的得意傑作，又常在人家雪白的牆壁上揮毫題句，這自非才子不辦的，何况又全具備了才子的一切條件，這才子的頭銜，自然再推却不得了。及至在他父親逝世援的一番表示，更堅定了人們對於他的才子的認識。原來在他父親病死之援，他憤怒極了，在將成殮之時，他怒目戟指，差不多指到他父屍的鼻尖上說道：你對死的時期，怎麽不先考慮考慮？我現在僅是考得一名秀才，你就死了，有甚風光？你何不等我一回，讓我中了狀元，至少也得一個探花，進士，那時你才歸天，那不但你的喪葬要豐美得多，便是我做孝子的，也可大大的闊一下，出一下風頭了。他這樣的數說着，大槪他父親也自知理屈，千元的一聲不饗。而這一來，他的才子佳名，益發喧傳遐邇了；因為他是世居東門的，故又稱他做「東門才子。」</p>
<p>此外，他在趕考時花盡了川資，到茶館去開講聊齋等，也都是才子的本色。雖則他左右不過一個秀才，但據他說是為科舉廢除之故，吾則，一個舉人是穩得到手的。</p>
<p>二十年來，他一直墮落着，但他生活是不會發生問題的，因為他能到那公衆地方去給入講山海經，講狐鬼之類，他又暗地裏給高小的學生們做搶手，於是除了才子之外，又給人送了他一個有脚書廚」的副號。</p>
<p>我們的郭先生，他就這樣的過着一世的才子生活。</p>

<p>你生平對於「吃一的學問，未曾廣博，往往不免顯出「外行」氣派，如進四川館而不慣吃辣，進天津館而不喜大葱，進廣東館而嫌菜燒生了，飯燒硬了，甚至進敎門館而要活殺鰥鰻，笑話就鬧的更大。但是「跌一個筋斗學一個乖」，生活在大都市要，對於「吃」的「乖」，不能不學。</p>

<p>— 郭蘭馨</p>
<p>天堂，是建設在罪惡上面的，萬惡淵截的大都會，許多人都認為是天堂，在幻想進天堂之前，已經陷入罪惡的深淵中去了。</p>
<p>上海，是建設在罪惡上面的天堂，桃紅色的生活是陷入罪惡深淵中的一條墮落之路。</p>
<p>在桃紅色的生活中，有當前的歡笑，有過後的惆悵，有甜酸苦辣的滋味，是由金錢，靑春，享樂，墮落的混合體，結果有的懸崖勒為，回頭是岸，有的披上頽廢的外衣，陷進萬刦不復的罪惡深淵，做了天堂底下犧牲的角色。</p>
<p>上海，儘有許多女性，為了生存的鞭策，為了實歡享樂的誘惑，塗脂抹粉，奇裝豔服，工嫵媚，擅啼笑，出賣伊們的靑春肉體，靈魂來博取伊們的需要。有一般男子們用金錢作代價，收買女性的一切來供自己的恣肆狂歡這是兩性桃色生活形成的賣買局面，極像是一個兩性的市塲。</p>
<p>男女雙方成交時好像很滿意，過後發現了缺點，未免發生爭執，這種桃色事件不時在社會新聞中廣播，也好像無綫電中的節目，不時改換演出，</p>
<p>大飯店，大酒樓，戲院，舞塲，公園，或者簡直在街頭，是男女兩性扮演桃色活劇的塲所，在上海這種塲所設備很周到的，可以將陶醉的男女安排得很舒適，但記好切莫踏進法院之大門，因為經過道個大門桃色活劇已到最後一幕，並且不幸成為悲劇而終止。</p>
<p>情愛，是會變臉的，姦淫就是情愛的變臉，前者為人所歡迎，後者為人所醜惡，其實這是一個本體，我愛你的甜言蜜語，背後是一副我控告你的兇惡相貌，黃金可以市愛，有了贍養費可以去姦淫人家，因為人家看見了你的贍養費就會誘惑迷醉你去姦淫，好像魚兒上了鈎，其實到底誰是魚兒誰是鈎？可不能分別。</p>
<p>娼門沒洛，舞榭林立，繼之而起的是嚮導社，那些年靑的女郎，供男子們應徵嚮導，在酒家，在旅館，嚮導些什麽呢？還不是扮演兩性桃色的把戲，前天有人呼籲嚮導社嚮導去了他的愛人，也是一個血紅色的新聞。</p>
<p>强鄰逼境，時局嚴重，上海的桃色生活不斷地在演出，我想大上海在將毀滅之前日，這種生活也會存在的，天堂？地獄？上海？是桃色生活，還是血淚所凝寫的罪惡史</p>

<p>— 頻羅</p>
<p>上海一切的蟲類都少，簡直絕無而僅有，然而臭蟲却獨多，不在內地的蚊子之下，朘吸脂膏傳播毒菌的惡德，不愧二時瑜亮」，最堪痛恨的，它是「殺人如草不聞聲」的大陰謀家，專門在黑暗中鬼鬼崇崇的肆行活動，暗箭傷人，等到受害人痛極而醒，開燈捕捉，它早悄悄地逃得無影無踪了，——不像蚊子來時，還有一陣類似飛機的薨薨之聲，預先警告我們，可以趕緊預防，二則，我們可以利用蚊帳或紗橱做鋼甲鐵絲網，抵禦紋子的進攻，對於臭蟲，却毫無辦法，祇好束手待斃！雖則，現在科舉萬能，藥物完備，有「飛立脫」「蠅殺倒」，臭蟲藥粉，及其他……各種極猛烈的新式武器，恰始終不能制臭蟲的死命，仍舊驕恣橫行，略無忌憚！因為它們的生殖力旣强且速，又藏匿得特別隱秘，决非戔戔藥物所能够普遍的消滅，就是毒殺盤踞　床褥間的一小部分，它們依然可以從鄰室的壁縫裏鑽了過來，或者很巧妙的繞道從屋頂上跳墮下來，設法膏其饞吻滿其慾壑而後去，於是人力與樂力俱窮！我今年採用歷來相傳的唯一秘方「勤捉」，寢不安席，格殺勿論，三四個月以來，每日捕殺的臭蟲，平均總在四五十隻以上，綜計已被我勦除五六萬隻左右，但我至今仍被它們咬得瘡痍滿目，體無完膚，沒有一夜能够安安穩穩的睡覺！記得，有一次，我到某報館訪友，小坐五分鐘，臨走的時候，從壁上掛衣釘上取下長衫，祗見襟袖問蠕蠕地平添了一二十隻野心的臭蟲，上海臭蟲之多，委實駭人聽聞，這又是內地所萬萬及不上的！好在臭蟲向來被稱有「富貴蟲」，恰又充滿了金銀之氣酒肉之氣，也許臭蟲之所以獨多，正由於靈氣所鍾，不失為人傑地靈呢？如果多的是王猛據座解衣而捫的白蝨，那就忒嫌寒酸氣太重，不免成為這繁華之地的污點，使上海人大大的坍台了！</p>
<p>本人喚臭蟲為「南京蟲」，以前俗語也常常說，「南京有三多，臭蟲多，驢子多，候補道多，」可見得南京的臭蟲，也是久已中外馳名，有目共賞的！不過自從改為新都之後，氣象煥然一新，今昔大不相同，驢子和候補道，都已銷聲匿跡，早成歷史上的陳蹟，祇不知臭蟲之盛衰情形如何，是否也啊小小滄桑之感？我沒有在南京住過，不知道南京的臭蟲，到底比上海怎樣，楚「魯衛之政兄弟也」呢，還是「如小巫之見大巫」呢，自不敢臆測妄斷，有所軒輊，但我以為南京的臭蟲，充其量總不會再多過於上海，上海的臭蟲，最低限度，也决不會少於南京，這倒要請幾位久住京滬的統計專家，出其經騐和心得，忠實的審核比較一下千纔好！祇是，臭蟲不喚做「上海蟲」而偏喚做「南京蟲」，這究竟是上海之幸呢，抑或是臭蟲之不幸呢？</p>
<p>從去年起，上海又多了一種蟲，僅僅比臭蟲稍微少一些，就是那弄糞轉丸的蜣螂，（？）遍地都是，驅之不去，也是上海居民的一種大患。「這從何來，遽集於此？」大衆都百思不得其突然生殖蕃盛的原因，但有人對證古本，以為書上早有「海上有逐臭之夫」一語，怪不得「物以率聚　，彼此「臭味相投」啊！其然，豈其然乎？</p>

<p>第七回　手足情高匿函憐弱妹　詩書氣重窺影笑寒儒</p>
<p>梧軒看看他的樣子，依然是很苦惱。自己也呆着想了一想，這時，只見夢蘭前額的劉海髮，掩住了兩條長眉。他的眼睛如何，也不能看到。百點了兩點頭道：走罷，我送你回去罷。夢蘭也沒說什麽，悄然的隨　　哥後面，走回家去。梧軒到了家門口，低聲道：我不進去了，你一切如常罷。夢蘭雖受了這樣的叮囑，但是在心裏頭總算栓了一個疙疸。到了中午，越是感着不安，便破例自動的到李友梅家去，要找他談話。不想到了李家，他們的女僕，答覆得很可動心，說是到親戚章家去了。夢蘭想了一想，未便等候，掃興而回。這李家女僕所說，却是眞話，友梅也有點疑惑，為什麽談到章唳天，夢蘭就有些不自在的樣子。他雖沒什麻口風。到章唳天家去留心一看，就可以看出形跡來了。他有了這番意思，就偕了家中一點平常的交際，獨自到章家來。在這天中午天氣巳是很有望夏天的風　了。友梅撐了一柄布傘，在路上走來，彷彿覺到地面上有一股熱氣，倒捲上撲襲人家的身體。走到了章家，他們家天井裏那兩棵老樹，倒是做了半院子淸陰，雖然在樹葉　裏，巡透露一些陽光！散在靑苔點點的磚地上，做了白的花紋，然而先有一陣凉風向人身上撲着，敎人自然的把煩悶的心胸，先淸楚凉爽一下，友梅收下了布傘，站在天井裏，先呌了一聲伯母。章老太覺得這樣長的夏天日子，不可白費了。手捧了一件舊衣服，在窗戶底下，有凉風的所在，緩緩的縫聯着。回頭看到是友梅，呌了一聲李小姐，便迎到院子裏來。笑道：堂屋裏坐呢？還是房裏坐呢？女學生是不怕人的，堂屋裏風凉一點，就在堂屋裏坐罷。友梅到了堂屋裏，眼睛早是在四週一射。這就看到國器的房門外垂了一幅　漆的竹簾子。簾子外看簾子裏，是不大淸楚的，但微微的聞到一股沉檀香味，由簾子裏了出來，而且看不到這裏外之間，有一絲絲烟。因道：伯母家裏，什麽地方都收拾得乾乾净净的，都回以坐（八七）</p>

<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、初堅繼平、後則又復高漲之象、初因業外多頭、鑒於花紗近期大跳、故開價時、人心亦見激昂、近遠期均漲五六七分不等、旋則業中人因洋麥連小兩日、手中浮頭、一致脫手、人心遂見逐步小去、較之初價、回落三分、迨至下午開盤近期交易、已見淸寂、價亦起伏不多、因粉市之重振、因起二三分、至二三月份、因外行重行暢吸、遂高漲五六分、照目下情形、已無情理可言、所謂純屬投機化也、現麥存到兩稀、貨主繼續喊價、昨開高車麥五元丸角半、又較昂近角、但各廠嫌其價昂貨决、進胃轉懈、全日祗申大成數百包云、</p>
<p>昨客秈頭雖旺、然以南帮去路更暢、人心隨之進展、粵帮注意糙秈、而糙秈日來到存較少市面更見緊俏、咋市激漲一角至角半不一、機米則為汕頭暢辦、本街與北洋亦續有問津、故市面亦復向上價亦步升五六分至角許、元米與碎米米粞則祗大三五分云、全日開出贛米六千九百包、湘米三千六百卅七包、台秈一千二百廿包、京糙一百七十六包云、</p>
<h3 id="c194">種米缺貨獨俏 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源共二十餘號、貨共四千餘石、何如本銷亦滯、僅包胃尚覺活動、計靑島北平天津大連等帮辦新薄稻四百餘包、薄破七八百包、及厚新粳二三百包、故結果厚新粳行價又眨九分、而　種以乏貨見秀五分、百哥無甚上洛、松洋尖去路忽香、價提五分至一角、厚薄破粳因已落令、致雖啊客帮暢辦、而價卒難提升、呈無榮無辱之態、新陰千元尚見帶緊、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下來源三十六七號、市上各米消胃、新粳羊杜埠尖拾巧略有交易、破粳滯呆、餘貨平淡、市形新粳價疲幾分至近角、破粳跌去一角左右、羊杜尖變千元客尖定局、埠尖價修　四分、客棟乏貨無市、陳薄稻未做開、</p>

<p>咋日黃豆市况、本以釗少而緊、但被大連市電報續跌後、本市人心因之軟化、市塲中頓時少一榨油廠主力交易、其他銷路亦見减低、統市祗開九江遲豆漢口乍豆一千四百包、及枕豆沙黃中興准秋豆等七百餘包、行情外表雖不亦、然骨裏已弛鬆不少、在散市時開榨油廠辦去臨淮關一車、價為五元三角四分云、</p>

<p>木耳前昨座日疊據漢口電訊、如興安及河口耳、前後竟飛漲近十三元、查前市為八十四元六角、昨電已升至九十七元、而市勢仍緊、申市因之大振、行盤一致呌高、如銷旺尚有續緊之望、</p>

<h3 id="c197">淋病在德國之　徹底辦法 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>必須注意的幾種不合理之治療　…淋病預後問題研究所在二個月曾召開五次會議　…對於偽樂的擇別病家應具充分之常識免彷徨岐途</p>
<p>淋病的治療，是一個最難解決的問題，因為它起初的傳染，是因淋菌侵襲尿道粘膜，但是在數天至二週後，淋菌卽由粘膜深進入血液內，分布週身，這時倘再服以局部的治療藥物，其效力簡直就等於零。然而以前的療法，都是一概採用局部尿道的透膜殺菌。你想，卽使局部淋菌除去，全身淋毒的流竄光爆發，它的危險不家什麼法子阻止嗎？這是不合理的治療之一。幸而這種療法已完全宣告失敢了。這已經是讀者所知道的事實。</p>
<p>但為了歐洲是盛行花柳病的地域，由於環境的需要，於是就有一派守舊者主角折衷辦法，倡行透膜殺菌合抗毒療法，這種非驢非馬的治療，早為一般識者所齒冷，病家蒙其害者年以萬計。查該療法之根據，不過是仿照畢德博士之治淋理論。這真是『畫虎不成，反類狗也』。畢德博士是柏林花柳病院淋病科主任醫師，就臨床實驗及化學研究室歷年心苦的研究所得，發明了一種用蛋白體合黃色素製成的『克淋儂』，專供淋病男女急慢性濁帶之用，效力獨著，毫無副作用。服後能昂盛全身的特殊抗淋素，使發生最偉大的喰滅淋菌機能。故能在短時期內治愈後，卽可根治，終身不發，惟婦女白帶應兼以『卡而雪地』外用。據柏林晚報記者Hunter氏雲：柏林淋病預後問題研究所所長Montrea氏於一九三四年曾極力推行『克淋儂』。而本年春二個月中，開討論會五次，謀取締該胃仿誤人劣藥，聞今已由官方取締，而全歐遂以『克淋儂』為圭臬矣。</p>
<h3 id="c198">愛的維擊術 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 南通醫科大學畢業武鐘麟醫師</p>
<p>怎樣保持你的青春？　先要治好你的病患！</p>
<p>「人老色哀」，這句話在女子是很可怕的，因為女子比男子容易老，所以兩性的的愛情，往往中途決裂的。但這是什麼原因呢？大概早衰的女性，十九都有月經乖亂，卵巢機能不健全，乳房和臀部，也都不能達到健全的境界。又因此而來神經衰弱，貧血失眠煩悶，沈　，益使病態加重，玉容消瘦，憔悴動人，毛發黃落早白，肌肉因松馳而有皺紋覆額。就是眼也失去動人的光采了。這，完全是老境狀態，請問還能維持愛情麼？</p>
<p>這種病，不但早衰，還有不孕的危險，那末家庭的中更發生不寧的空氣了。我從多數人的實驗，凡女子有了上述任何一症，都可服「補女容」一藥，因為這藥是調整卵巢，增加新血液，促進新陳代謝機能之旺盛，並有充實肌肉的功效。所以月經不調者因調而受孕。而神經亦獲強壯，並可喚回消逝的青春，服後肌膚細膩如凝脂，面貌豐腴有如蘋果色之美麗，不但有去病之功，更有駐春之效。所以「補女容」實是愛的維系之要素。但是女子如兼患白帶的，可兼用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，以滌除白帶。更為內外兼顧的療法。</p>

<p>— 姚菊巖醫師</p>
<p>不速治卽成廢人</p>
<p>患者鄒思孟君，年二十八歲，患淋病後，因不戒於酒及勞動，變成關節炎，在足，膝，腕，肘，肓胛等關節，悉作疼痛，隨後腫賬發熱，若偶爾勞作，則膝關節之痛楚，不能忍耐。其關節之滲出液體，有化成膿汁之趨，余乃用針抽出驗之，果有無量數之淋菌與膿血球相附而生（如第一圖）急行抗淋血清及電療法後，一方更進「克淋儂」以消炎鎮痛，退腫防腐，而撲滅淋菌，經三星期之治療關節腫痛，果已十去七八，續服「克淋儂」二星期，腫痛全愈，臂腕肘膝伸轉自如。再用針抽血驗之，毫無淋菌蹤跡，（如第二圖）鄒君此病如不速治，一旦成為關節強直，不能運動，即等廢人矣。但此病如不服「克淋儂」亦難全愈。因此藥有使全體發生抗淋素，使廣泛之淋菌，亦能包圖而喰殺之，毫無漏綱。若服局部之透膜殺菌藥必致敗事矣。是安可不慎其用藥哉！凡曾患淋病表面已愈或未愈之患者如感到關節酸痛者均可服「克淋儂」預防而治愈。免趨惡化也。</p>

<h3 id="c202">賭生命的自凟 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 俄國勞動醫科大學畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>自瀆時忘記了自己生命　自瀆之後卻又十分懊悔</p>
<p>青年時賭生命的勾當，再沒有象手淫這種惡癖可怕了。在那一時興奮之時，忘記了自己可貴的生命，事後卻又追悔不迭。這樣不僅性神經要衰弱，就是整個神經系統都不能健全了。因為自瀆（手淫）大概多起於正在發育的青年，把好好的青春腺斷喪，中途停止了他的發育，一切性組織都失去常態。所以有生殖器短小，幾乎與兒童無異，跟著又有遺精，早洩，勃起力不足，精液稀薄，久婚失孕，而頭痛失眠，心悸健忘，貧血，身體瘦弱，遇事生厭，憂　悲觀等症，亦紛然而起了。</p>
<p>我們要說挽救他，不可忘記了改造性系組織的方法。據法國名教授康多爾西Condorcet博士說：要改造性系組織，除了服「補體康」一藥，是沒有其他的藥物可服的。因為「補體康」是用青春期的動物的內分泌提煉而成。服後能促進性腺分泌機能之旺盛，把生殖系的組織整個的徹底改造。所以不僅下部發育健全，勃起力強壯，就是一切性神經衰弱如遺精早洩，以及頭痛眼花失眠健忘等症，都可同時治療愈了。不過如有遺精病時，可以同時服「耐力斯遺精片」則奏效更速了。這是千萬人試驗證明的事實。按康多爾西博士，是我在俄國勞動大學醫科時的教授，我的愛用「補體康」及「耐而斯遺精片」，也是博士指點我的。歸國以來以「補體康」治癒青年由手淫而來的性病，其成績之優異，實是任何藥品所不及的。因其藥性王道，效力持久，這幾點也是可證明了。</p>

<p>如何挽救已成壞症之淋病</p>
<p>淋病失治，最易轉成壞症。其原因由於淋菌富有強頑抗毒力，且又善竄，一如土匪，到處破壞組織，在初患淋病時，症狀雖十分凶險。但苟如醫治得法，決不致變成壞症。然據經驗告訴吾人，因患者意志薄弱，誤服劣藥，致引毒入內，或者因醫家手術不精。亦能使病狀轉變難治，是淋病壞症，蓋不出上述兩端也。</p>
<p>凡為淋毒性關節炎，睾丸炎，敗血症，心臟內膜炎，尿道狹窄，攝護腺漏等，皆可視為淋病壞症，輕則抱病終身，毒染妻子，重則生命因而夭折，至可懼也。有住泥城橋漆開泰君，年廿五歲。染淋病多年，既誤服劣藥於先，又誤行粗劣手術於後，病勢反而增劇，惶恐萬狀，嗣幸在大東書局購到余之「性病全書」，知余善治淋病，乃墾余治療，診斷之余，已成攝護腺漏，且已傳染其夫人。乃行局部手術與電療外，囑往中西大藥房購服「克淋濃」，使體內發生抗淋素以喰菌，作根本之治療，經過五星期之不斷治療，攝護腺炎已全部治愈，排尿快利，惟腺體以受淋菌破壞，乃更囑內服「補體康」至二星期而痊，經用X光檢查，腺體平復健全如故。其夫人白帶，除囑服「克淋儂」外，外用「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥，以滌除白帶，亦四星期而愈。蓋非依此治法，決難挽救此項壞症也。</p>

<p>肺病和普通的疾患，完全兩樣。一般疾病都是帶有急性的，而肺病則皆不知不覺中得來。它的發生很慢，要待結核菌在肺中侵蝕成為病灶，且其人抵抗力瀕於衰歇時，才會有顯明的症狀表達出來。凡是用思想靜坐不動的人，很容易生病，因為他不運動，故抵抗力薄弱。但運動或勞力劇烈了，肺部也受影響，也要予給結核菌絕好的機會。</p>
<p>在秋寒時候，人們是最易於傷風的，傷風的　嗽咯痰，便是氣管有手病之證。這是肺癆的先聲。當然，傷風咳嗽，是有著補肺特效藥「補肺拿爾」的根本挽救的，但服得越早越好</p>
<p>其次青年們因耽於手淫，耗喪精液，此致身虧體憊，抵抗力毫無，這也是患肺病的原因，除了服「耐而斯遺精片」治療遺精外，自以進服「補肺拿爾」治癆為主。據務國最著名專家的研究，「補肺拿爾」的治療肺癆，簡直好象金雞納霜之治療一樣，凡吐血　痰，盜汗潮熱，胸痛食減，服後在最短期間，卽可全部治愈。</p>

<p>白帶，婦女多視為隱病，故多諱莫如深，以致遷延日久，腐糜愈深。成潰爛者有之，子宮出血者有之。凡此病患，於房事小便均有妨害。小腹腫痛，月經不調，生殖無望。故宜速療。但既畏羞而不敢至醫家求治。則莫如用德國『卡而雪地陰道片』為坐藥，以防腐止泌殺菌，連用三四星期後，即可全治，陰部乾潔如處女，病灶亦完全治愈，惟因淋不淋毒傳染而來者可兼服『克淋儂』，以殺內部淋菌。又因帶病而來月經不調，身體虛弱者可服『補女容』，則帶淨而經調，卽可恢復受孕力。洵白帶病患者，在家秘密自療之良法也。</p>

<p>二十六年已將到來，吸煙的人若再嗜痂煙癮，將不能避免國府的戒律，而受到死刑了</p>
<p>但說起來也真傷心，那引起煙民並不是不願把煙毒戒除，實在是戒煙時因沒有可靠的製劑，故而痛苦重重，於是大都半途中止，重複吸食，不說別的，單說那些賣野人頭的戒煙藥，功效只能作用於性腺，並不能旺盛全身因煙毒而消滅之荷爾蒙，服那些性腺製劑，豈非驢頭不對馬嘴？有煙癖的人，你盡管去問任何醫生（滑頭藥商不在此列），煙客是不是缺少荷爾蒙？</p>
<p>余用德國大生理學家梅倫氏，所發明之荷爾蒙製劑『補體康』內服，即或將煙毒戒絕，而毫無痛苦。經過數千餘例之實驗，皆在短時內戒絕煙毒，而且因荷爾蒙增加，戒後且能迅增體重云。</p>

<p>那是春天，我的臉常常發赤而帶熱感，頭是重重的，太陽筋很痛。不能思想，看書就眼花。每睡到半夜，便要作桃紅色的夢，所以連帶的就發生遺精。並且後來隔一兩天卽要遺一次。簡直不能看見異性，否則便心跳神蕩，陰具勃起，同時精液便流出來。</p>
<p>醫生說我不能結婚，因為性神經是這樣的衰弱，而且毫不發育，性器小如食指。曾誤購某遺精藥，詎料服後遺精如前，且胃口倒閉，小腹不舒。適巧我的舅父從倫敦習醫歸來，他說歐洲著名性病專家耐而斯氏發明的遺精片，在德國及英美現在極其風行，我初猶半信半疑，但試服了『耐而斯遺精片』不到三瓶，遺精便已停止，精神頓增，胃口照常。舅父又說我該服『補體康』荷爾蒙製劑，以增加發育，因為只有荷爾蒙才能有此功效，是我舅父武守信醫師說的。當我服『補體康』約四星期，頓形發育，身體也高了半英寸，面部肌肉細嫩，腦力也強健起來。</p>

<h3 id="c209">悼魯迅先生 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 李因非</p>
<p>「人固然應該生存，但為的是進化；也不妨受苦，但為的是解除將來的一切苦；更應該戰鬥，但為的是改革。……倘使對於黑暗的主力，不置一辭，不發一矢，而但向「弱者」嘮叨不已，則縱使他如何義形于色，我也不能不說　我真也忍不住了……他　實乃是殺人的幫兇而已。」（魯迅：論秦理齊夫人事）</p>
<p>從五四運動到現在，魯迅先生是無時無刻不在和「黑暗的主力」戰鬥着的，五四時代的健將們，到現在不是退隱，便是站到敵人的營壘裏去了，而魯迅先生却並沒有給時代反淘汰，為了人　的「進化」，為了「解除將來的一切苦」，他站在時代的前線，勇敢而又堅强地向「黑暗的主力」「戰鬥」着，雖然是「受苦」，但他去視為不妨。</p>
<p>國為他始終是一個站在時代前鋒的戰士，所以年齡上的老對他不僅無害並且有益，當別位「老將」禁不住時代的急流所衝而跌倒，或者所而想拉住時代使他們能夠站住的時候，魯迅先生却在激流中學得了更豐富的經驗，這些經驗，是別個年青的戰士所缺少，或者甚至可說是沒有的。</p>
<p>因之，這位飽經世故的老戰士，就更值得我們好愛和擁戴。然而却又誰料到這位時代的前衛，會敵不住他生理上的衰弱，而離開他多難的邦國呢！</p>
<p>魯迅先生近兩年來很多病，但卽使在病中，他好像也沒有替自己的身體打算過，反之，他更加努力了，他在一篇呌做「死」的雜感上說：</p>
<p>「從去年起，每歲病後休養，在躺藤椅上，每不免想到體力恢復後應該動手的事情：做什麼文章，翻譯或印行什麼書籍。想定之後，就結束道：就是這　罷。—但要趕快做。這「要趕快做」的想頭，是為先前所沒有的，就因為在不知不覺中，記得了自己的年齡。却從來沒有直接的想到「死」。」</p>
<p>在這樣的努力下，　兩年來，就有「死魂靈」，「花邊文學」……等等書籍以及散見各刊物的許多雜文出現，而也國為這樣，他的身體更衰弱了，終於敵不住病魔的進攻，而一瞑不視。要是他能稍稍為自己的身體打算，在病體沒有完全恢復之前好好靜養一下，我想，當還不至於現在就死呢？然而，為了「解除將來的一切苦，」他在體力還沒恢復之前，便想着許多要做的事情，並且「要趕快做」了，說起來，這是自促天年，但是，這究竟是為誰呢？</p>
<p>他在遺囑上說：「不要做任何關於紀念的事情。」又說「忘記我管自己生活。—倘不？那就真是胡塗蟲。」這樣一位戰士死了，　我們輕易的忘記他，這實在是一件很不容易的事情，而「不要做任何關於紀念的事情」呢，在形式上，我們也許能夠做到，而在心底裏，我們却因為不容易忘記而時常「紀念」了起來，在「管自己生活」的時候，在讀到他的遺作的時候，我們也沒辦法不「紀念」到他，國為現在中國最大的問題，人人所共的問題，是民族生存的問題，所有的一切生活（包含吃飯睡覺）都與這問題相關；例如吃飯可以和戀愛不相干，但目前中國人的吃飯和戀愛却都和××優略者多少有些關係，這是看一看滿洲和華北的情形就可以明白的。」（見魯迅先生的病中答客問論現在我們的文學運動，）這樣，即使「不要做任何關於紀念的情事」似乎也就不大可能了。</p>
<p>自然，魯迅先生的所以要這麼說，他的意思是很明白的：因為不願人做胡塗蟲，所以呌他們「管自己生活，」不要去紀念他。介是在這裏，我們却可以看出，要「管自己生活，」那却只有依着魯迅先生的路走去（雖然有走法不同）。而在迢迢的長途中，一定要高法去忘記曾同路過的夥伴，那不　不可能，並且也大可不必的。</p>

<h3 id="c210">萬國殯儀館　瞻仰魯迅先生遺體 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 汶</p>
<p>一個不幸的消息，穿進了多少時代青年們的心坎，報紙報告給我們道：「中國文壇巨星」「魯迅先生死了」！捧著報紙，看印在上面的魯迅先生的遺容，我們一向只看到他作品，而從未見過面的青年們，都難以抑止的會從心的深處自然流出了涔涔的熱淚。作為我們文件戰線中對於每一個時代青年，廣大社會群眾，是多麼一個值得萬分痛心的不幸的消息啊！</p>
<p>十九日的晚報上記著魯迅先生遺體於明日移到膠州路萬國殯儀館，任人瞻仰。對於這樣中國民族戰陣中的的巨星＼我們平日是不能見得到他的，直到死後，他才能以最後的遺容可以自由的和敬仰他的青年，社會群體們相見。懷著十二萬虔敬的心，我於二十日的早晨，特地很早的起來，遠遠的趕到萬國殯儀館去崇敬的瞻仰一下我們這位老戰士，文壇世星的遺容。</p>
<p>到膠州路時間是早上八點半。時候尚早罷，萬國殯儀館門口，靜悄悄的，人還來得不多。進門，兩旁立有很多招待者，簽過名，我肅敬的踏上了禮堂的紀念階級。進去，人也是很少的，禮堂已佈置了花草松柏，十幾個大的花圈，堆在魯迅先生的遺像之旁。方方的臉孔，濃濃的鬍　，這就是我們常在刊物上所見到的魯迅先生的遺像了。在遺像兩旁，供著兩瓶鮮花經，拖下一條紙條，上面寫著：「魯迅老師千古，」「十二個青年敬獻」。此外，是他生前唯一摯友日人內山完造，以及日本武官喜多少將，沈燕冰等的巨大花圈。內山完造在這晨，內山書店的職員，半數都被請到這裏做招待了。內山對魯迅有特別的交情，這偉大的友誼，使我們對　會同時發生很大的敬重之感。</p>
<p>樓梯上一路鋪著輕軟的地毯，我無聲的輕輕的嚴肅的走了上樓。魯迅先生遺體就停在靠西一個房間內。床斜放著，栗色的綢被安靜的覆蓋著他的遺體，他安靜地臥著，臉子瘦得非凡，他病已久了，濃濃的鬍　，不整齊的聳在他的上唇，兩頰下端也繞著短短的鬍　，兩目靜閉，雖然瘦，但他生前的豐彩，我們還可以從照片中認識得到。這就是我們這時代，影響著從五四以來十幾年間中國整個文化前進陣線的唯一的巨人了！我誠敬的對他遺體鞠了一個躬。床的四週，放著很多鮮花與花圈。我立著，迷惘的，一陣的悲哀，咬著我的心，我幾乎要掉下眼淚來。我們將以怎樣的一顆心，來哀悼這位文化巨人，青年唯一導師的魯迅先生呢</p>
<p>有幾人在拍照。我惶然的又慢慢退出了他的房間。我再回去看看他。這是我第一次見到這偉大的文化領導者，同時，這也就是最後一次的見到他了。我無論如何，不能把我悲傷的心壓得平啊！</p>
<p>退出禮堂，又在階前立了片刻。這時來　者漸多了。有某校女學生一二百人，班著隊來。當我離開萬國殯儀館的時候，我逆料著一定有更多的青年群眾，都會遠遠地，抱了萬分虔敬的心，來這裏憑吊這位文壇唯一巨人的遺體的。</p>
<p>從魯迅先生的死，我又想到了不久逝世的世界最高作家高爾基。當高爾基死去的時候，排著幾裏長隊到紅場瞻仰他遺體的蘇聯民眾，總數在幾十萬以上。然而我們的時代唯一戰士魯迅先生的死去，只是幾個作家們。他不能在死後使更多的民眾都有機會來瞻仰他，對他致哀。雖然，他的死，會打動每一個中國前進青年的心，和高爾基的死沒有兩樣。</p>

<p>母親進城到姊家去了，父親也有事出了門，只勝了我一個人靜靜的在屋子裏讀書。</p>
<p>「長貴的在家？」</p>
<p>忽然簾子開處，一個罩著破葦笠的頭探進來，向我招呼。</p>
<p>「哦—」我茫然的抬起頭。</p>
<p>「一份租粒。」</p>
<p>「噢。」</p>
<p>於是我拋開書，找出本小帳本來，暫時執行了地主的職務。</p>
<p>那小帳本上有著熟習的父親寫的字，翻出了那人所說的名字，看著那名字下面的字，我說：</p>
<p>「一鬥七升五合？」</p>
<p>「是那麼個事，不過已經吃得不多了！」</p>
<p>他吞吐的說著，我沒有理會的就跨了出去。</p>
<p>他跟我到糧食屋裏去，擺好升鬥，一邊解著那糧食口袋繩，一邊又吞吐的說起來：</p>
<p>「長貴的，今年麥子不好，已經吃得不多了。」</p>
<p>這人身材矮小，說話時仰著臉，那臉子好像告訴人他怎樣蠢笨，守本分。</p>
<p>我習慣的說道：</p>
<p>「那怎麼行呢。」</p>
<p>他更嚅　了：</p>
<p>「恐怕越吃了越少，今日就一起掃了掃送來了，早晨飯沒敢再吃，是煮了點粘粥喝的！」</p>
<p>我雖是外表矜持，心裏卻有點感動；我知道我自己是在怎樣的罪惡中活下來的，結果是果然尚欠許多。我這行為卻正也感動了他，他的眼裏露出兩道情感的光，好像感激他這小主人竟這麼慈善！</p>
<p>這時另外一個人也負著一袋糧食進來了，這個年青壯健高身材，一隻又有鋒棱的鼻子，仿佛一個不馴服的記號。</p>
<p>他大聲的跟我爭執著說是不今年收獲的不好，無論如何不能付清。</p>
<p>按著小帳本上的數目字，一鬥一鬥的量過後，兩個人又跟著我到父親的屋子裏去，看著我把帳記存後，又照例的叮寧著：</p>
<p>「長貴的，寫上帳了？」</p>
<p>我點點頭，靜靜的坐著，他們都拿出煙袋來吸煙，吸過煙後，那年輕的把煙袋插在大煙合包裹，向著他的同伴說道：</p>
<p>「走吧！」</p>
<p>「你先走，我還待一會兒。」</p>
<p>那年輕人橫了他一眼，就抬起糧口袋來，自己走了。</p>
<p>留下的那個的這行為，使我感到了興趣，我靜靜的看著他，他也終於拙笨的向我看了，並且有個不自然的微笑掛在嘴角上說道：</p>
<p>「長貴的，有沒有冷煎餅，（一種用小米作成的食物）賞我兩個吃，今早只喝了點稀粥，不充饑，又走了廿裏路，餓得怪難受！」</p>
<p>這猛來的襲擊，有點出我意料之外，我相信我的表情也不自然了，我趕緊回過頭去，向著窗外院子裏一個洗衣服的女僕說道：</p>
<p>「還有煎餅嗎？拿幾個給這上租料的。」</p>
<p>這女僕是受過訓練的，她知道在主人面前怎麼給省點東西，她不需思索的就編了出來：</p>
<p>「了不得！煎餅哪裏有啦！今早連喂狗的都不夠。」</p>
<p>我幾乎是連墾求加命令的說了幾句，那在早晨只喝過稀粥的人才得到了幾個冷冷的煎餅。</p>
<p>看著他那滿足的目光跟那襤褸的背影，我深深的有所感觸，我知道我是在那怎樣的罪惡中長成的呵！</p>

<p>巾幗天資鳳姐娘。雌凰生性女兒強。威權獨掌榮寧府。還有知心悄梅香。異景繁華能消受。恨無端夫婿太輕狂。送宮花驚醒陽　夢。笑聲聲忽送楚襄王。卻厭春風群芳俗。最愛的十月笑容四月薔。一局相思全不悟。癡心可笑賈天祥。寧府夜來得兒耗。　才善理可卿喪。送靈格柩弄權鐵檻寺。叔嫂同軍也無妨。老尼巧弄如簧舌。說什麼為愛示提把陰隙傷。是月良辰逢設宴。金樽同進紫霞觴。聽外邊喞喞人私語。怪家雞竟作野霞觴。私事風聞家僮訊。姑悉溫柔別有鄉。大觀園陷入苦尤娘。紅樓有景無非攀。　意癡情　不忘。　金　去終渺茫茫。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Developing the North China Economy: Japanese Side Has Specific Plans, Including Five Items Like Road Building and Port Opening; Both Sides Will Consult on a Draft Agreement, and Counterproposals Will Be Submitted in Early November <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the economic development of North China, the Japanese side has decided that China will provide land and labor, while Japan will be responsible for technical guidance. Various joint ventures will be organized according to Chinese company law. The Japanese side has formulated a plan: the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Road will be 300 kilometers long, running through the hinterland of Hebei Province, serving as a key line for rural development. The construction cost will be 15 million, and the method of sharing the cost between China and Japan will be drafted by the Hebei-Chahar Transportation Committee, with construction to begin no later than next spring and completed in a year and a half. Second, related to the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Road, North China needs a port for import and export to facilitate the export of products. It has been decided that Tanggu will be the main port and Dagu the secondary port, with the Japanese Navy investing 30 million to build them. Third, to prevent the Tanggu port from being silted up upstream, it has been decided to fundamentally improve the Hai River water conservancy, opening canals to release silt and irrigate farmland. The specific plan will be designed by Japanese water conservancy expert Dr. Sakamoto, requiring tens of millions of funds. Fourth, to develop the countryside, production and sales cooperatives will be established, with thorough guidance to improve cotton seed varieties and encourage wool production. Loans will be provided to farmers with products as collateral, and sales will be guaranteed. The Japanese side has decided to invest 5 million yuan. Fifth, the Longyan iron ore mine will set up a steel plant in Pingsi Tangshan, requiring 30 million yuan, shared by China and Japan. The above five matters are the first proposals made by the Japanese side for developing the North China economy, and are also defined as the foundation of Sino-Japanese cooperation, which will eliminate the difficulties in proceeding with Wan Tong. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the economic development of North China, China and Japan will each submit counterproposals. At the beginning of next month, the two sides will consult in Beiping to finalize a draft agreement. Tashiro has drafted: 1. the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Road construction plan; 2. the Tanggu port construction plan; 3. the Longyan iron ore development plan, which will be taken back to the country by Ikeda, the director of the Economic Advisory Department of the military, for instructions. When Ikeda passed through Dalian, he met with Matsuoka, the president of the South Manchuria Railway, to exchange opinions. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the Sino-Japanese Company's attempt to attract Japanese financial groups such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo to invest, because each financial group is unwilling to be bound by military policies and prefers to proceed independently, the company's fundraising of 100 million yuan has failed. It has now been reduced to 40 million yuan, combined with the original capital of 40 million yuan, making a total of 80 million yuan. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The five major electrical companies in Tokyo are also afraid of risks in investing in the Tianjin Electric Power Company, and have reduced their investment to 2 million yuan. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese control of the North China spinning industry has been defined as a key item of economic national policy. The Toyo Spinning Main Company is building the Yufeng Spinning Mill in the Japanese Concession in Tianjin, and various consortia will continue to invest 2 million yuan for large-scale development. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese Fukushima Textile Company is building the Shuangxi Spinning Mill in Zhengjiazhuang, a suburb of Tianjin. The plan is for this winter, construction to start next spring, and operations to begin in November. (20th Dispatch)</p>

Yufeng is under construction, and Shuangxi and Shanghai are planned. When the new factories are completed next autumn, the lifeline of the North China yarn industry will likely be entirely in the hands of the Japanese. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A reporter from the Central News Agency specially went to the Ministry of Communications on the 20th to inquire about Sino-Japanese shipping in North China. According to the spokesperson of the ministry, although the ministry sent personnel to Peiping in July last year to discuss the matter with the former Beiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee and the Japanese side, it was shelved due to differences of opinion. It has not been mentioned again since then. Regarding the reports in the newspapers, the ministry has not received a report from the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee, nor has there been any consultation, so it does not know the details.

Kirkpatric also said that his uncle is the famous electrician Cook, who has lived in London for many years. Before the Chinese Revolution, Mr. Sun Yat-sen often went to his home, and Kirkpatric's wife was still a young girl and used to play chess with Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Kirkpatric is scheduled to leave for China at the beginning of December. His office may be set up in Shanghai or Nanjing. Reuters also interviewed Guo Taiqi, the Chinese ambassador to the UK, who expressed his deep pleasure at Kirkpatric's appointment, saying that it was beneficial. In 1935, the British government gave great assistance to China's currency plan and ordered the British banks in China to hand over all silver reserves to the Chinese government. Kirkpatric's new appointment, although not related to politics, will have a spiritual impact no less than economic benefits. The ambassador also said that this will make the Chinese people understand that the UK is actively concerned about China's welfare and will encourage them to work harder for national rejuvenation. The ambassador met his wife and baby son in Marseille and returned to London last night. Everyone is in great spirits. The ambassador was a little unwell in the early summer and went to Germany for treatment after taking a vacation. He is now in good health. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) This morning, the Times reported that after the Export Credit Loans Department announced the new Sino-British Export Credit Loans plan yesterday, the rumors of loans to China were put to rest. The department's decision is timely, as British manufacturers and British businessmen in China have rarely or never received this special kind of assistance. Even in places full of doubts and accusations, such as the Far East, the department's decision is now difficult to be fantasized or misunderstood. This decision is not out of political or competitive motivations. It also does not necessarily exclude the collaborative financial assistance of China itself. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph said that we have significant losses and must first make up for them before we can restore our old position among the countries trading in China.

<p>(London) Newspapers commented on the Ministry of Commerce's Export Credit Loans Bureau's appointment of Kirkpatric as its representative in China, believing it to be important. The Financial News stated, "The socio-economic situation is changing rapidly. How can the Far East remain an exception for a long time? China's economic and political situation, which was considered hopeless a few months ago, has now become the most promising market for Western goods. The world is now deeply concerned with China's development of industry and improvement of economic construction. China has made real economic progress in the past year. The key is the new monetary policy implemented by the Chinese government in November last year, which has been very successful. Even in terms of industrialization, its basic conditions have already been completed." The Financial Times stated, "China's position toward Japan is special. It is obvious that there is a lot of room for development for British commerce with China." (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The UK Ministry of Commerce's Export Credit Guarantee Bureau announced today that it has appointed Conservative MP Kirkpatric as the bureau's representative in China. Financial circles speculated that Kirkpatric's appointment as the bureau's representative in China would greatly facilitate British exports, especially heavy industry products. The mission of the representative in China, as officially announced, is to serve as a correspondent for the Export Credit Guarantee Bureau, responsible for assessing the risks of various credit loans. All loan proposals submitted to the Export Credit Guarantee Bureau will be subject to detailed investigation and research by the representative in China. When necessary, the representative in China can also participate in loan negotiations. Financial circles also believe that Kirkpatric is only responsible for examining various financial and economic proposals regarding the export of British goods, so that British exporters can be protected on a trade basis. In addition, the government does not intend to subsidize trade with China, nor does it intend to lend to China. Kirkpatric will also work closely with British Commercial Counselor Pilar in Shanghai after he goes to China. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding President Chiang's 50th birthday, two dates have recently emerged, one is October 29 and the other is October 31, which are two days apart. Which one should be used as the standard has attracted the attention of the country. The reporter specially visited Chu Minyi, who is well-versed in the calendar. According to him, President Chiang was born on September 15 of the Guangxu Dinghai year, which is October 31 of each year in the Gregorian calendar. This should be the unchanging birthday. The 29th is calculated according to the lunar calendar, because September 15 of this year's lunar calendar happens to be October 29, so this day can be regarded as President Chiang's lunar calendar birthday. Therefore, it is not impossible to regard both as President Chiang's birthday. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>— Shou Zhuo</p>
<p>Pingdi Spring is the Center of Eastern Suiyuan</p>
<p>In a correspondence from "Suiyuan, A National Defense Frontline" in August, the reporter briefly mentioned the importance of Suiyuan's terrain and the recent crisis, and predicted that the enemy would definitely launch a larger offensive in the near future. Therefore, although Suiyuan appears to be relatively peaceful on the surface, it is actually full of dangers. Unexpectedly, two months later, the prediction came true. The bandits' preparations in the Zhangbei-Shangdu area and the comings and goings of behind-the-scenes figures along the Ping-Sui Railway suggest that a conflict is imminent. It is foreseeable that our Eastern Suiyuan will inevitably suffer another fierce attack, and this attack will be more ferocious and more significant than before. This is something that all citizens of the country should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Disturbing Eastern Suiyuan is only one step in a larger plan. Its greatest significance is to connect Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Gansu, and even Xinjiang into a line. Then, on the one hand, they can fight against Russia, and on the other hand, they can control North China and the entire northwest of China. From a historical perspective, the Suiyuan-Inner Mongolia area has great significance for the entire China. For example, Emperor Qin Shihuang used Inner Mongolia as the foundation for deterring the Xiongnu, Emperor Wu of Han also used it to control the frontier, and the Tang Dynasty used it to subdue the Turks and Uyghurs in order to stabilize the northwest. The Manchu Qing Dynasty went a step further, using Manchuria and Mongolia as the basis for entering and ruling the Central Plains. It can be seen that the terrain of this area is important for the rise and fall of the nation. Therefore, the survival of Suiyuan is not only a matter of gaining or losing territory, but also a critical juncture for the loss or gain of the opportunity for national revival. How will we use the power of the whole country to preserve it?</p>
<p>The five counties in Eastern Suiyuan are Xinghe, Fengzhen, Liangcheng, Taolin, and Jining (i.e., Pingdi Spring). The front lines are Taolin and Xinghe, Pingdi Spring and Fengzhen are the second line, and Liangcheng is at the rear. Because Pingdi Spring and Fengzhen are on the Ping-Sui Railway, they are more important than the other three counties. Pingdi Spring, due to its military, transportation, and economic relationships, can be said to be the center of Eastern Suiyuan.</p>
<p>(1) From a military perspective, the terrain in Eastern Suiyuan is mostly flat and indefensible. Only the section from Taolin to Pingdi Spring is a plateau. (Pingdi Spring is 1,400 meters high, the highest point on the Ping-Sui Railway, commanding a strategic position that is easy to defend and difficult to attack. If we can defend this section, then we can fight forward or retreat and defend based on the terrain. Otherwise, if Taolin is lost, Guihua is in danger. If Pingdi Spring is lost, the rear supply will be cut off. Therefore, to defend Suiyuan, we must defend Eastern Suiyuan; to defend Eastern Suiyuan, we must defend the section of Pingdi Spring.</p>
<p>(2) From a transportation perspective, Pingdi Spring is a key point on the transportation route between Suiyuan and Shanxi provinces. Pingdi Spring to Datong is the only military transportation route between Shanxi and Suiyuan. If this route is cut off, Suiyuan will immediately fall into isolation and all communication and supply with the outside world will be cut off. This is a strategy that the enemy must take, and whether Suiyuan can be maintained depends on whether we can maintain this transportation route.</p>
<p>(3) From an economic perspective, Pingdi Spring is the center for grain collection in the entire province of Suiyuan. There are as many as forty grain stores in the city, and other businesses are also very developed because of this. The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications both have branches there, with a total of forty to fifty thousand yuan in loans. The market on both the east and west sides of the bridge is very lively, and it can be said to be the wealthiest place in the entire province of Suiyuan, and also the only center for rear supply in Eastern Suiyuan. If this place is lost, the rear supply will be cut off immediately. If this place is occupied by the enemy, it can instead supply the enemy and increase their aggressive power. Pingdi Spring can be said to be the most important center in the rear supply of Eastern Suiyuan.</p>
<p>The importance of Pingdi Spring in military, transportation, and economic terms has been described above. The enemy is also paying very close attention to Pingdi Spring. Since the loss of Rehe and the occupation of northern Chahar, the enemy has been plotting to open up the three provinces of Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan, connect them into one, and build a railway. Recently, the light railway from Chifeng to Dolun has been opened to traffic. The section from Dolun to Zhangbei has already started construction, and the section from Zhangbei to Shangdu is also being planned. In the future, it is planned to connect from Shangdu to Pingdi Spring to connect with the Ping-Sui Railway. Then, in the future, whether in military or economic terms, they can control the three provinces, and then control the northwest. The enemy's strategy of advancing westward also focuses on Pingdi Spring, which further shows the importance of Pingdi Spring.</p>
<p>Based on the current situation, the war in Eastern Suiyuan is inevitable sooner or later. The victory or defeat of the war in Eastern Suiyuan will affect Suiyuan, Chahar, Shanxi, and Inner and Outer Mongolia, and will also affect the entire Northwest, and even the entire national revival. The military leaders currently responsible for Eastern Suiyuan, such as Fu Zuoyi, Chairman of Suiyuan Province, Zeng Yan-yi, Commander of the 128th Brigade (formerly Commander of Bandit Suppression in Eastern Suiyuan), Damilingsulong, the General Administrator of the Four Banners of Eastern Suiyuan, and Zhao Chengzhou, Commander of the Cavalry in Datong, are all determined to defend. However, in terms of strength, resisting a well-prepared invasion seems to be insufficient. We hope that the three provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shanxi will unite and use all the power of the three provinces to protect Eastern Suiyuan. We also hope that the central government will use the power of the government to provide all the needs of the three provinces. We also hope that the people of the whole country will use all their strength to support the front line.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Observations on Soaring Prices <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>In the past half-month, the cotton yarn market has undergone drastic changes again. At the same time last year, there was a rumor of currency reform, causing prices to rise wildly and then stop. This year, prices are rising again due to cotton yarn rising by more than eight yuan and then being suspended. Some say that this year's rise is different from last year's. At this time last year, currency reform had not yet materialized, so the rise was illusory. This year's rise is proof of the success of currency reform, so it is real. The difference between illusory and real cannot be measured. However, commodity prices were relatively stable this year, but speculation was concentrated in the cotton yarn, flour, and wheat markets, causing turbulent waves. Since this month, the rise has been driven by a shortage of spot goods and outbound sales, rising one after another. Yarn prices are indeed strong and expensive, rising by more than ten yuan at once. Unbleached fabrics are almost sold out. Yesterday morning, the opening price of standard yarn jumped by ten yuan, which is indeed a rare occurrence in the market.</p>
<p>However, the rapid rise in prices is not entirely due to a shortage of spot goods. Tracing back to its cause, there are several reasons. First, commodity prices should have an upward reflection after currency reform. Otherwise, reforming the currency system would be meaningless. At the beginning of the currency reform, commodity prices did rise, but there was no shortage of goods for sale calculated in foreign currency. The increase was still small. After this year, accumulated goods have been exhausted. Currently, what is being sold is mostly goods with higher costs, so the selling price has risen accordingly. Since foreign goods are expensive, domestic goods are also stimulated. Second, Japan and the United States have a strong demand for our agricultural products, especially Japan. Troops stationed in Northeast and Tianjin regions are stockpiling grass and grain to meet military needs. They are buying wheat and storing cotton to meet industrial needs, resulting in firm and high prices for cotton and wheat. Third, since soybeans have been manipulated by Japanese merchants, they have risen several times compared to last year. As a result, this year's soybean prices are all expensive. On the one hand, rice has had a bumper harvest, and less foreign rice is being imported. The grain decided by Guangdong and Fujian is concentrated in Anhui and Hunan, allowing rice prices to be maintained without collapsing. Fourth, although there is no reliable estimate of the average harvest in various places this year, it is generally good, and prices are also high. Farmers have ample income and have a strong demand for goods. However, industry and commerce, in view of the sluggish market and poor sales in recent years, have reduced production and stopped machines, unwilling to accumulate too much inventory. When demand suddenly comes, they cannot meet it, so prices soar. Fifth, the mentality of the wealthy has changed. They buy gold and hoard goods, seeking monopoly in order to manipulate the market and disregard profit. Sixth, speculators see an opportunity to take advantage and are actively shorting the market in order to fulfill their great desires. Hence, there is today's market situation.</p>
<p>Rising prices make farmers rejoice and benefit industry and commerce, seemingly indicating a revival of our country's economy. However, what should be noted is that the balance between currency value and commodity prices should be just right. An increase that is too great will lose its effectiveness. This is the first point. China is the final destination for dumping foreign goods. High prices easily attract a large influx of foreign goods. This is the second point. The textile industry, even domestically, is gradually becoming a case of the guest dominating the host. If the advantages and disadvantages are not examined, and prices are wildly raised, it would only create opportunities for others, which would not be worth it. This is the third point. The most worrisome thing is that the degree of increase is too fast and the surplus and deficit are too great. If one side cannot sustain it, the impact can be seen immediately. Moreover, the so-called shortage of spot goods is not entirely driven by actual sales, but has a hoarding and waiting-for-higher-prices element. Then the reaction will be even more violent. Market tremors are very dangerous. This is the fourth point. Recently, vegetables, fish, and meat are all expensive. If they become as expensive as rice and firewood, it will cause workers to demand higher wages, which will lead to more disputes. This is the fifth point. From the above, the recent rise in commodity prices still contains many worrisome factors and is by no means something we can be overly optimistic about.</p>

<p>(New York) The most expensive presidential election in American history, this year's, is estimated to cost between $20 and $25 million U.S. dollars between the two parties, with the Republican Party spending more. Both the Republican and Democratic parties have exerted themselves to gain the Black vote. Republican presidential candidate Landon has promised to completely ban the lynching of Black people and has specified the benefits of unemployment relief and agricultural subsidies in his proposed new measures. President Roosevelt is also working hard in the election race and is currently touring the New England states by car with his family. Landon's attempt to break the Democratic Party's power in California has failed and he is scheduled to give a speech to more than 100,000 people in Los Angeles today. (Reuter, 20th)</p>
<p>Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA The Republican election candidate, Kansas Governor Landon, departed from here yesterday for Los Angeles and delivered a campaign speech before his departure. He strongly criticized President Roosevelt's business treaties with fourteen countries, especially France and Canada, saying, "The principle of reciprocity is inherently sound, but President Roosevelt's New Deal abuses this principle and fails to consider the natural environment of the market. The American domestic market is gradually being occupied by foreign agricultural products. The commercial treaties signed by Roosevelt with various countries will inevitably lead us to adopt a narrower economic nationalism and other doctrines that endanger the peace of the United States and the world." (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Albuquerque Republican presidential candidate Landon said in a speech from the back platform of his special train today that this election is a reckoning of two political ideas, one in which the welfare of the people is controlled by politicians, and one in which Americans can still govern themselves. The people should protect the provinces from domestic attacks and should ask President Roosevelt to explain whether the New Deal has abandoned democratic policies and embraces the narrowest economic nationalism. The New Deal has gradually realized past mistakes, and the current government should bear the majority of the responsibility for promoting the world economic war. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt worked as usual today and will depart for the New England states tomorrow for his third major campaign speech, giving an important speech in Providence, followed by visits to Boston and other places, and finally staying briefly at his home in Hyde Park, New York. It is said that the President's speeches in Boston and other places will be very exciting. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau today denied former President Hoover's recent claim that the Treasury Department had deliberately manipulated the books to deceive the people, saying that if this slander was not corrected, its impact would be enough to damage the credit of the federal government, and that Hoover's remarks were unbridled.

<h3 id="e64">Japan Intends to Participate in World Economic Conference; Convened After U.S. Presidential Election; Japan Demands Guarantee of Exchange Rates <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that although Japan intends to participate in the future World Economic Conference, it may preemptively demand a guarantee for the Japanese yen exchange rate. The Japanese Foreign Ministry expects that the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States will invite Japan to participate in this conference. Recently, it dispatched a commercial commissioner to Osaka to notify Japanese business leaders of this matter, and also jointly studied this issue with the Ministry of Finance and various bankers. Japan believes that as a result of the collapse of the European Gold Bloc, a World Economic Conference will be convened after the U.S. presidential election. Its main purpose will be to stabilize international currencies and eliminate trade restrictions, but it must be based on the monetary agreements of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. If Japan participates in this conference, it may, in addition to the above two objectives, strive to achieve a freer distribution of world resources. The Japanese side believes that this matter is a major factor in moving towards world peace. At present, the general Japanese people are quite concerned that the United Kingdom and the United States may propose to fix the Japanese yen exchange rate at one shilling and five or six pence in British gold, instead of the current one shilling and two pence and one point. If this is the case, Japanese trade will be severely affected. Therefore, it is expected that Japan may demand an understanding on this matter before participating in the World Economic Conference. (Reuter, 20th)</p>
<p>Osaka Finance Officer of the Ministry of Finance, Yuta Tomita, gave a speech at the Osaka Economic Association on the 20th, focusing on the currency issue of the devaluation of the French franc. Regarding the position of the Japanese yen, based on the current state of international currencies, he stated: "The world's currencies have generally depreciated by 40%, but the Japanese yen has now depreciated by about 70%. Compared with the world's level, it seems that the Japanese yen has depreciated by an extra 30%. This, along with trade issues, is a topic of discussion in the world. However, in the history of the Japanese gold standard, it was about 30% higher and has been maintained until now. This decision to reduce it to an appropriate value. Countries around the world say that the Japanese yen is cheaper, but when a currency agreement becomes an issue in the future, this point may be criticized. As for placing the Japanese yen in its current position, it is necessary to solve Japan's population problem, so we must explain to the world that it is not that Japan has arbitrarily reduced it."

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Emperor's brother, Prince Chichibu, will represent the Emperor at the coronation of the British King. Prince Chichibu will be transferred from the 31st Infantry Regiment in Hirosaki to the General Staff Headquarters soon to prepare for his trip to England. The Imperial Household Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, and the Japanese Embassy in the United Kingdom are carrying out various preparations. It is reported that Prince Chichibu is scheduled to leave Japan with his wife on the Terukuni Maru next March. It is also possible that he will pass through the United States on his return to Japan.

<h3 id="e66">Japanese Chemical Industry <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>San Francisco The Pacific Institute released an investigation report today stating that if a war breaks out in the Far East, Japan will become the world's fourth largest chemical industry country. Although the Japanese chemical industry is currently working in peacetime, it, like commercial aviation and many other industries, can be transformed into military industry overnight. Even in peacetime production, most of the chemical industry's products are absorbed by the Japanese army and navy. At present, the Japanese chemical industry is only inferior to Germany, the United States, and Russia, and is on par with the United Kingdom, surpassing France and Italy. However, the Japanese chemical industry does not have centralized management like the American DuPont Chemical Company, which is the only weakness, which prevents it from achieving full development. The scale of the Japanese chemical industry is very large, but it is mostly a side business of large factories. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Hitler appointed Aviation Minister General Goring today to be fully in charge of the economic construction Four-Year Plan. It is generally believed that this is a victory for the conservatives. The government and the National Socialist Party will actively cooperate from now on to make the German economy self-sufficient. (National Socialist Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Führer Hitler ordered today to grant Aviation Minister and Prussian Premier General Goring the highest authority to promote the new Four-Year Plan, so that Germany's required raw materials will no longer depend on foreign supply. It is believed that this new appointment does not contain any opposition to Economic Minister Dr. Schacht, because the doctor needs to fulfill his responsibility as a financial expert, which is still the same as before. (Reuter, 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Aviation Minister Goring has been appointed by Führer Hitler as the "Four-Year Plan Dictator". The order issued by Führer Hitler stated, "I announced the Four-Year Plan at the Nuremberg Congress. Now, to implement it, we must unite all the strength of the German people and concentrate all the authority of the party and the country before we can succeed. Therefore, I specially appoint Goring as the dictator and give him full authority to implement the Four-Year Plan." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Aviation Minister and Prussian Premier General Goring has become the "Four-Year Plan Dictator" and has become the Prime Minister. The Four-Year Plan, since it was officially announced by Führer Hitler at the National Socialist Party Congress last month, difficulties have been discovered in its implementation. It is necessary to select a senior official to take overall responsibility for its success. As far as economic policy is concerned, some believe that a self-sufficiency policy is not enough to revitalize commerce and therefore express their opposition. Others believe that after the successive devaluations of various currencies, the German mark still maintains its original value, which is very unfavorable. In addition, the Four-Year Plan contains a provision that all raw materials lacking in the country should be replaced by domestic products to avoid reliance on foreign countries. However, these substitutes are generally higher in price and lower in quality than natural raw materials, and must be ordered in batches every year, which is very inconvenient. Therefore, for this plan to proceed smoothly, it is necessary for someone who is highly respected to take on this arduous task. The most suitable candidate is General Goring, because the general was authorized by Führer Hitler on April 27 this year with the power to handle raw materials and foreign currencies, and is an old fighter of the National Socialist Party, with a high reputation, which is enough to maintain Economic Minister Dr. Schacht and persuade the people to accept the Four-Year Plan.

<p>(London) Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Churchill, the leader of the extreme faction of the Conservative Party, delivered a speech in Goldingham, Essex, tonight, reiterating his long-held view that Britain should establish a good understanding with Germany. Churchill said, "It is very easy for Britain to establish an understanding with Germany, and it may not be difficult in France. Apart from restoring pre-war colonies, Germany's only requirement is to allow it to act freely in Eastern and Southern Europe. Today, people talk about peace and collective security, which is very pleasant, but how can it help in reality? I hope that even if there are mistakes, there is no doubt that I am one of those who fear a world war. Therefore, European countries should unite and set up a strong military force, then the world war can be avoided, and international law can be maintained." (Havas, 19th)</p>

<p>Talavera Spanish rebels continue to advance, and Madrid is under extreme pressure. The southern front line, where General Franco's right-wing troops are located, has threatened the important railway line from the capital to Albacete and Valencia. The north of Madrid, which was originally the concentration point of the main rebel forces, has now become even more powerful with the addition of Moroccan troops and elite regular troops, and has advanced to Valmojado, 25 miles west of Madrid. Judging from the situation in various aspects, the government forces will soon retreat from the excessively flawed outer defense line to the trench-dug positions inside. The rebels may encounter strong resistance at this point. Prime Minister Caballero and War Minister Valles are now trying to place the independent militias under central control and to establish a spiritual connection between the military commanders and their soldiers. However, the rebels are not in a hurry to attack, believing that cutting off all supply sources to Madrid is enough to control its fate. At present, the Spanish government wants to imitate the events of the French Revolution, attempting to use the power of oral speeches to inspire the Madrid people to fight. In a government communiqué issued today, it contained the famous military order issued by French General Joffre on the eve of the Battle of the Marne, and asked the people of Madrid to work hard to resist in future major wars, just like the citizens of Paris defended the capital in 1914. Since last week, Madrid has been conducting a large-scale investigation of women who sympathize with right-wing parties. As a result, more than 1,000 people have been imprisoned in two buildings. Their husbands and children are mostly standing near the buildings, although they can hear their mothers or wives crying for help, they are unable to rescue them. The situation is so tragic that it is heart-wrenching. (Reuter, 20th) Barcelona Spanish President Azaña arrived here today from Madrid with Justice Minister Dr. Funis and Cabinet Minister Giralt, indicating that the government's downfall is imminent. Prime Minister Caballero, who recently took office as Commander-in-Chief of the government forces, remained in Madrid to direct the defense work. (Reuter, 19th) Barcelona Spanish President Azaña arrived here today, accompanied by four cabinet members, escorted by twenty-five cars. The reason for the President's visit here is unknown, but it is understood that this act is to arouse the people in the Iberian region to support the government, and will go to other places from here. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar Spanish rebel general Llanos announced today from Seville that Barcelona has been officially declared the capital of the Iberian Republic. If this news is reliable, then Navy Minister Prieto's proposal to abandon Madrid has won, and Prime Minister Caballero's opposition has failed. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>Talavera Barcelona has begun to mobilize men from the ages of eighteen to forty to prepare for the war. The daily rations of the people have now been implemented there. Women can be seen lined up every day, searching for food. The news that President Azaña had arrived in Barcelona from Madrid has not yet been announced. (Reuter, 19th)</p>
<p>Madrid The government forces today are holding the last defense line, preparing for a large-scale rebel attack. The soldiers have received double the amount of bullets, lined up in a semicircular array, and set up defenses in the dangerous places in the capital. At present, the center of the war is in Navalcarnero, fifteen miles southwest of Madrid, and Torrejón and Talavera, fifteen miles south. The government authorities have today completed the people's evacuation safety plan and ordered the soldiers to rather die in battle than be killed after the enemy's victory. Today, a team of government bombers and pursuit planes, assisted by heavy artillery, began to counterattack the rebels approaching the capital. Government censorship of news is extremely strict, and half of the content is often deleted before it is telegraphed. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>Talavera The national army on the southwest side of the capital, led by General Varela, will capture the city of Navalcarnero in a matter of days, and launch a final offensive against the city of Madrid. It is now consolidating its positions and using many trucks to transport food from the rear in order to attack. In addition, the radio station belonging to the national army in the city of Logroño recently sent out a message stating that the Madrid government had issued a notice to the soldiers on the front line, saying, "Although the soldiers cannot advance, they should not abandon their positions. Rather than retreat a step, it is better to die in the hands of the enemy." This is the same wording as the order issued by the late French General Joffre in the Battle of the Marne at the beginning of the European War. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Madrid Unconfirmed news was received here tonight that the traffic between Madrid and Alicante has been cut off by the rebels. It is said that the rebels bombed from the air and completely destroyed the Alcazar station, 100 miles south of Madrid. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>Hengtai The Spanish Civil War has reached its fourth month today. It is estimated that as a result of the fierce fighting between the two sides, 175,000 people have died. The upcoming Battle of Madrid will result in even greater sacrifices. Of the above number, less than one-third died directly from artillery fire. The rest were mostly enemy party members shot by both sides, or died in the so-called purge movement. A certain officer under the rebel general Mara told an Associated Press reporter that when the revolutionary army occupies the capital, at least 30,000 anarchists and communists will be shot. Therefore, no matter which side wins, bloodshed will continue for months. After the leader of the "National Government", General Franco, conquers the capital, the first step will probably be to resolve some frustrated elements of the right wing, who, although they still support the revolutionary army, may eventually be excluded. If the government army wins, observers generally believe that Spain will become a communist country, but this move will also cause internal conflicts among the various left-wing parties. The reason why the rebels have been advancing steadily is partly because the anarchists do not unite with other radicals and carry out killings everywhere. Malaga, Bilbao, San Sebastián, and Irún have all been places where anarchists have committed evil deeds. When they see the rebels advancing, they inflict abuse on other left-wing elements as a "protest". (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Italian Foreign Minister Arrives in Berlin; Adjusting Policies of the Two Countries; No Treaty Negotiations <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Zengcheng, Germany Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano arrived here at noon today. The Italian Ambassador to Germany, Adolico, came here to greet him and accompanied him to Berlin. It is estimated that the journey will arrive there at 7:48 pm. At that time, German Foreign Minister Neurath and other important figures will be at the station to welcome him. After Ciano arrives in the German capital, he does not intend to stay at the Italian Embassy. He will set up a room at the "Unter den Linden" residence. He is scheduled to begin talks with Foreign Minister Neurath on Wednesday morning. It is expected that it will take two days to complete. On Wednesday evening, Foreign Minister Neurath will host a banquet. On Thursday, the Italian Embassy will hold a welcome party. Ciano will go to Berchtesgaden on Friday to visit Führer Hitler and issue a communiqué afterwards to explain the results of this trip, and then return to Rome on Saturday. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to political circles here, the purpose of Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Berlin is to adjust the policies of the two countries and does not want to negotiate any treaties or agreements, but will clarify the attitudes of the two governments on the Locarno Pact, the future of the League of Nations, the Spanish Civil War, and the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty. (Reuter, 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The political circles here regard Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Berlin as extremely important. Ciano is accompanied by four Italian foreign experts. It is now learned from well-informed sources that Ciano and German Foreign Minister Neurath may discuss the overall European political situation, focusing on the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty, Belgium's new neutral policy, and the scourge of Bolshevism. It is said that issues related to colonial affairs and the Mediterranean are also on the agenda. (Reuter, 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to predictions from political figures, after Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Germany, Germany and Italy may decide to recognize the military government of the Spanish rebels. Germany will also recognize Italy's conquest of Abyssinia. Ciano's talks with German leaders will probably focus on the Spanish affair and the scourge of the Bolshevik Party. Germany seems to intend to enact laws for Italy to participate in the "Anti-Communist Crusade." As for the Austrian issue, the German-Austrian Agreement, the attitudes of Germany and Italy towards the League of Nations, and Germany's demand for the restoration of colonies will probably also be discussed. After Ciano arrives in Berlin, he will also be formally received by the German government to facilitate negotiations. However, according to diplomatic practice, when a foreign foreign minister comes to visit, a formal reception should invite the ambassadors of various countries stationed in the capital to accompany him. However, when hosting the Italian foreign minister, it is planned to break this tradition. The ambassadors of various countries stationed in Germany will not be invited. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<p>Brussels The Belgian government seems to have decided to do everything possible to stop the activities of the fascist Rex Party. Socialist Foreign Minister Spaak recently gave a speech advocating that the parties of the coalition government unite to fight the fascist party. Yesterday, the National Executive Committee of the Liberal Party held a meeting to express its support for Spaak's proposal. This evening, a newspaper published an article that was obviously authorized by the government, stating, "Those who take risks and seek luck have now revealed their true colors and are formally provoking. The result will be that the Belgian people will lose their freedom and all social classes will be plunged into poverty. Therefore, for several months, the moral and political atmosphere has been poisoned. Although the government has used various means to stop it, these rabble-rousers have never retreated and must do their best to deceive, insult, and slander. If the honest people of Belgium are all bewitched by heresy, then our country will be completely corrupt and there will no longer be a piece of dry soil. The people of the whole country should know that this is the trick used by those who want to establish a dictatorship. Now, the only way to follow the instructions of the government and warn each other not to enter the path of destruction is to save us." In addition, Rex Party leader Degrelle continues to attack Transportation Minister Jaspar in his organ newspaper "True National Newspaper", and said that Prime Minister Zeeland and the Transportation Minister colluded in corruption. The cabinet is scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss this issue. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<p>(Singapore) The expansion plan of Singapore Port is progressing rapidly. The required funds amount to £1.2 million. After the completion of the new port, its length will be approximately three miles. Singapore will have the most complete dock equipment in the East. Two docks will be completed in the spring of next year, but the entire project will have to wait until 1938 to be completed. At present, a number of huge cranes are engaged in loading and unloading cement stones weighing 20 tons for the foundation of each dock. When this cement stone sinks to the bottom of the water, divers enter the water and use telephones to direct the crane's actions. There are many sharks in the seawater there. One diver's clothes were bitten by a shark, so now when entering the water, they all carry sharp knives to defend against sharks. (Reuter, 20th)</p>

<p>(Rome) The government's response to Britain's recent memorandum regarding the Locarno Conference was delivered to the British Embassy here this morning for forwarding to London. British Ambassador Drummond conferred with Foreign Minister Ciano this afternoon. The contents of the response are not yet known, but it is generally believed that it will not be made public. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Locarno Five-Power Conference, since the British government sent notes to France, Italy, Germany, and Belgium on the 19th of last month, Germany's response has already arrived. The Cabinet meeting this Wednesday will discuss it. Furthermore, since King Leopold of Belgium issued a declaration, the situation regarding the Locarno Conference has undergone a change, and it seems the Cabinet will also study this. According to responsible sources, the British government is still awaiting the responses of Italy and Belgium to the British note, so it will not take a position for the time being. It is reported that the Belgian Ambassador to Britain, Mr. Marchant, has indicated that Belgium allows the agreement drawn up by the Franco-Belgian General Staff to be respected as valid for the time being. However, Belgium has apparently not yet made a decision regarding future relations with Western European countries. As for Germany's recent proposal to conclude a Four-Power Agreement between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, and to jointly guarantee Belgium's neutral status, some people in British political circles have expressed considerable support, but others believe that the new agreement proposed by Germany is useless. Britain can only guarantee its own security by rearming. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The British government is currently awaiting the arrival of the Belgian response, at which time it will express its views. It also believes that the true meaning of the neutrality declaration recently issued by King Leopold III of Belgium can be found in this response. (Havas, 20th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The chairman of the Radical Socialist Party caucus in the Chamber of Deputies, Mr. Campinchi, will serve as the general political situation reporter at the party's congress. Mr. Campinchi recently issued a statement saying that the majority of the Radical Socialist Party is willing to see Prime Minister Léon Blum's policies succeed. Any action that would hinder the cooperation between the party's leaders and the current cabinet should be avoided by the party. Regarding the issue of cooperation between the Radical Socialist Party and the Communist Party, he said, "If our party splits with the Communist Party at this time, it would be to promote the breakdown of the Popular Front and cause the current government to collapse. I believe that our party congress will not want to bear this heavy responsibility. As far as the Socialist Party is concerned, there is no possibility of forming a left-wing government without its participation and the Socialist Party will never accept any policies without the support of the Communist Party. From this perspective, it is very clear that our party should not split with the Communist Party." Mr. Campinchi concluded by saying, "The platform of the Popular Front is, in fact, the platform of the Radical Socialist Party. The Communist Party has now accepted this platform. Even if our party were to put itself in their place, we could not do better. As for if the Communist Party is now engaged in revolutionary action, then the Radical Socialist Party will naturally join the anti-Communist front and fight against it, but in that case, the responsibility for the split will no longer be borne by the Radical Socialist Party."

<p>Capital of Yugoslavia: Both houses of parliament formally reconvened today. The Senate elected Maglajanić, a member of the "Working Group" (government faction), as speaker by a vote of 49 to 38. The House of Representatives elected Cirić, a member of the Radical Union (led by Prime Minister Stojadinović), as speaker by a vote of 196 to 68. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia: Construction of the new parliament building began years ago and has only recently been completed. Both houses of parliament held an inauguration ceremony today and are scheduled to formally reconvene tomorrow. Since the current Prime Minister Stojadinović came to power in Yugoslavia, former Prime Minister Jeftić has been in opposition. Several members of his party were criminally punished for their involvement in the assassination of the Prime Minister (March 10th of this year), which weakened the party's original strength. The party has since split into two factions: one with more than ten members, led by Maričević, and the other including Jeftić himself and several of his political allies. They have now joined the Yugoslav National Party (also an opposition party), but the majority of key members of the National Party caucus in the Senate have withdrawn due to their opposition to Jeftić's joining. It seems the strength of the opposition has declined, and several members of the House of Representatives have formed the "Working Group" during the parliamentary recess to support the current government. It is foreseeable that the government's position will become increasingly stronger. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<p>Exchange of Opinions on Economic Cooperation in North China, Tashiro Expresses Eagerness for Cooperation to Materialize, Li's Observations on Economic Development, Believes Can Indeed Shift Sino-Japanese Political Situation Tianjin Correspondence, Li Sze-hao arrived in Tianjin from Peiping on the afternoon of the 18th around 6:00 PM. On the afternoon of the 19th at 3:00 PM, accompanied by Chen Chueh-sheng, he visited Japanese Commander Tashiro at the Japanese Army Headquarters in Hai Kuang Temple in the Japanese Concession. The discussion lasted two hours. At the time, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army, Hashimoto, Senior Staff Officer Iida, Staff Officers Kazu, Senda, Adachi, and attached officers Nagamine, Suzuki, etc. were all present. Tashiro introduced them to Li and they exchanged opinions on economic cooperation in North China. Tashiro expressed that the Japanese side is urgently seeking the realization of economic development in North China and hopes that the Chahar-Hopei side can have someone like Mr. Li to be responsible so that progress can be made quickly. In addition to expressing his personal opinions, Li also explained the process by which he accepted the position of Chairman of the Chahar-Hopei Economic Committee. He took his leave at 5:00 PM. Afterwards, he contacted Japanese Consul General Horiuchi by telephone and requested an impromptu meeting. Horiuchi agreed, and he then went to the Japanese Consulate General. According to Horiuchi, the Japanese side has placed its utmost faith in economic cooperation in North China and hopes that it will be realized quickly. He also hopes to promote political stability in North China so that Japanese financial groups can invest without worries. Li took his leave around 6:00 PM. That evening at 7:00 PM, Chen Chueh-sheng hosted a banquet for Mr. Li at the North Ning Residence on Hai Ho Road in the Special Area, inviting Qi Xie-yuan, Wang Yitang, Lu Tsung-yu, etc. to accompany them. Li is scheduled to meet with Tianjin bankers and industrialists on the 20th, return to Peiping on the 21st to report to Song, and go to Nanking around the 25th for consultations, as well as meet with financiers in Shanghai and return north within ten days. It is heard that the Japanese side hopes to emphasize railways, mines, and aviation in the economic development of North China. Although they also hope to realize ports, electricity, Lu salt, and cotton production, they do not have enough capital to invest a large amount at once. Furthermore, financial groups such as Mitsui, Okura, Mitsubishi, etc. are mostly unwilling to be controlled by the army and invest large sums in projects designated by the military. They also feel that the current Japanese military strategy towards China carries the risk of rash action, and that capital investment has no guarantee. Therefore, in order to entice financial groups to join the economic cooperation policy, the Japanese military has reversed its pro-war stance. Senior officers of the Japanese garrison in North China especially want to promote the economic development plan in order to prevent the young officers of the army and navy, who advocate for war in China, from having a pretext. Therefore, the Japanese military in North China has not yet taken active steps to divide and disintegrate the Nanjing diplomacy. The Hsing Chung Company seems to have the same economic policy as the Japanese military on the surface, but in essence, it is still mostly based on the Japanese military's proposals. It probably wants to use the company's detached position to mobilize funds domestically and facilitate the operation of various industries in the development of North China.</p>
<p>At 7:00 PM on the 19th, Li Sze-hao met with Tianjin reporters at the Hotel des Colonies. Before he returned to his residence, he asked Qian Shouyi to entertain them first. Qian then explained Li's itinerary on his behalf. After 7:00 PM, Li returned from the Japanese Consulate General and told the reporters that although the economic development of North China is a local matter, it can indeed shift Sino-Japanese political situation. If this matter can proceed smoothly, it can at least reduce some of the diplomatic burden. The results of my meetings with Tashiro and Horiuchi today were generally very good. It is a pity that Staff Officer Ikeda, the chief of the Third Section in charge of economic affairs in the Japanese military, returned to his country due to an event, and I was unable to talk with him. The key economic development outlines emphasized by the Japanese side, such as cotton production, Lu salt, the construction of the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway, the mining of the Lungyen iron ore, and the organization of aviation, etc., are most eagerly awaited in the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway, aviation, and Lungyen mine. The construction of the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway is determined, but how to start construction has not yet been determined. Today, I and Tashiro and Horiuchi exchanged views on general matters. They did not make any specific expressions. I told them that since we are talking about Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, the first thing to do is to decide how to raise funds. Only with capital can we talk about cooperation. For example, the construction of the Cangzhou-Shijiazhuang Railway requires 20 million yuan, half from China and half from Japan. I asked where the Chahar-Hopei Political Affairs Commission would raise the funds, and it is necessary to allow them to think of a way. There are so many aspects of the economy in North China waiting to be developed. If there is no scope and they are all carried out at the same time, the Chahar-Hopei Political Affairs Commission will feel insufficient in financial resources and manpower. If the Japanese side is willing to show the scale, Song Chairman also has the determination to cooperate, and it can be carried out step by step. Tashiro and Horiuchi quite agreed with this. Therefore, I have decided to wait for Shannan to return and, based on the wishes of all parties, be responsible to Song Chairman to do it, etc. (19th)</p>

<p>Peiping Correspondence, according to reports from relevant parties, the organization of the puppet army in the northern part of Chahar is very large, but the content is extremely empty. The actual strength is no more than eight or nine thousand people, and most of them are a motley crowd. The names are also quite complicated. The pseudo-Mongolian First Army is concurrently commanded by Li Shou-hsin as army commander. The army is divided into four divisions, all of which are cavalry, totaling over five thousand people. The pseudo-Mongolian Second Army is concurrently commanded by Te Wang as army commander, with only two cavalry divisions, each division with three regiments, totaling over two thousand people. Recently, Bao Yue-qing expanded by more than a thousand people in the Duolun area. The pseudo-Anti-Communist Autonomous Army is commanded by Wang Ying, with the army headquarters located in Shangdu City. There are a total of two cavalry brigades, with the first brigade commander being Shi Yu-shan, leading more than a thousand people, and the second brigade commander being Zhao Kuige, leading only three hundred people. The rest are infantry under Li Ying, with no number, and are currently recruiting refugees in the Guyuan area. Those currently confronting the Sui army in the Pingdiquan area on the Chahar-Sui border are the two brigades under Wang Ying. The rest are still preparing to move and are quite busy. Wang Ying's troops have recently been concentrated in Shangdu. Their direction has been determined. They plan to divide their forces into two routes, one from Shangdu to Xinghe, to capture Datong and Fengzhen, and the other from Shangdu to Taolin, to capture Zhuozi Mountain. Heavy weapons have been supplemented within the puppet army, and there are four armored vehicles and several aircraft, all parked in Zhangbei awaiting orders. The situation in the eastern part of Sui is becoming increasingly tense. The Sui authorities have made strict precautions. However, even though the situation is like this, there should be no major changes in the very short term.</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondence, recently, the wind of smuggling has become very strong again. Because Shandong is adjacent to Hopei Province, and Tianjin is only 700 li away from Jinan, the number of smuggled goods transported by automobiles to Jinan, Zhoucun and other places is no less than sixty to seventy vehicles every day. Most of them are white sugar, cigarette paper, rayon, etc. On the morning of the 18th, the Tianjin Anti-Smuggling Office stationed in Jinan, which is authorized to prohibit road transportation smuggling by the Ministry of Finance, seized two automobiles of smuggled rayon, cigarette paper, and white sugar, and transported the smuggled goods to the goods factory of Jinpu Station, loaded into cars, and transported to Beijing. Unexpectedly, at 7:00 PM, a group of 70-80 smuggling ronin suddenly gathered at the station to cause trouble. With great momentum, they first surrounded the cargo room. Because the office staff there had escaped in advance, only the duty policeman Jin Ju-wen was on the scene and was beaten. Patrol Captain Yang Yu-zhi rushed to persuade them to stop, but he was also beaten and humiliated. They caused trouble back and forth in the station, and the order was in great disorder. All the anti-smuggling office personnel escaped. Staff Liu Mao-zhi was unable to escape and was caught by the ronin, dragged to the south platform of the cargo factory, and beaten with fists and feet, followed by sticks. Liu was unable to move at the time, lying on the platform, crying and wailing in a very miserable voice. At this time, the station employees also stayed far away, and no one dared to come forward to persuade them to stop. Many onlookers were also beaten and humiliated. The ronin then dragged Liu Mao-zhi to the anti-smuggling office, forced him to call the China Travel Service, and forced the person in charge of customs to come to the station and hand over the goods. Director Lin Le-ming also avoided coming to the station. Liu held the telephone, weeping and shouting, saying that if he did not come again, his life would not be guaranteed, etc. The ronin who transported the goods then tightly closed Liu in the room. At this time, the Public Security Bureau heard the news, fearing that it would cause trouble, and immediately sent Inspector Li De-qin along with the consultant of the bureau, Kageshita (Japanese), to the station to mediate. They discussed with the person in charge of the Japanese Police Station. As a result, the anti-smuggling office handed over the goods, and then the Japanese side released Liu Mao-zhi. The Public Security Bureau then invited the staff of the anti-smuggling office, Zhang Jia-kun and Gao Zhong-qi, to the station to discuss the matter face to face. When the Chinese and Japanese sides were about to prepare for negotiations in the first-class waiting room, the smuggling ronin broke into the living room and brutally beat Zhang Jia-kun and Gao Zhong-qi. Railway police and public security bureau personnel were unable to dissuade them. Gao and Zhang were both bleeding from their heads. At this point, the ronin became more and more proud, and shouted and strode out of the living room, still surrounding and refusing to leave. Negotiations lasted until late at night, and as a result, the goods were left in Tai'an, transported back to Jinan on the 19th, and handed over to the Japanese consulate for disposal. The dispute was resolved. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Ronin Sneak into Chao-Shan to Spy, Strange Warships Patrol Nanao Island, Swatow City is Full of Han Traitor Organizations, Japanese Women and Children in Swatow Return to Taiwan One After Another <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Swatow Correspondence, since the discovery of the discarded bombs in Kwong Tze 洋行 on the night of September 17, China and Japan have repeatedly studied the discarded bombs, and found many suspicious points. The responsibility issue has not yet been determined. However, the Japanese Consul stationed in Swatow has made a request to the municipal government, according to the resolution of the Japanese residents' conference, to arrest and punish the culprits, protect Japanese residents, and completely eliminate the anti-Japanese movement. Originally, there was a Japanese warship Akikaze berthed in Swatow Port. Since then, another Uzuki has arrived. Recently, Akikaze left Swatow and was replaced by Fuyou. There are always two Japanese warships on alert in the waters of Swatow. However, according to fishermen in Nanao who came to Swatow, recently there have often been ronin going to Nanao to survey the surrounding fortresses and photograph the terrain. Three or five people form a group. They do not notify our police authorities in advance to protect them. After entering the country, they gallop around without any scruples. In the past five days, there have been faster ships and submarines without national flags patrolling around Nanao Island. The submarine is No. 11, and its whereabouts are unusually secretive. Ronin have also been repeatedly discovered in the inland areas of Chaoan, Chaoyang, Chenghai, and Raoping counties, specializing in taking pictures of river banks, harbors, docks, markets, and other important defense points. Some also pretend to be medicine sellers, selling medicines and children's toys at low prices, and go to various villages, looking around, sometimes staying in food stores and opium dens. The purpose they hold is self-evident. It is heard that since September, no fewer than two to three hundred people have been newly dispatched to work deep inland, and their urgency can be imagined.</p>
<p>Since the discovery of the discarded bomb case at Kwong Tze 洋行 in Swatow City, the Public Security Bureau has tightened martial law, and armed military police are stationed at posts, with one soldier every five steps and one sentry every ten steps. Unemployed vagrants, hooligans, and so-called suspects in the city have been arrested by the dozens. According to a certain intelligence report, secret organizations of Han traitors are scattered throughout the city's key points. In certain warehouses in Kwong Wah 埠, Wu Bridge side, etc., which are farther from the city, ronin often gather late at night, and ronin use small boats to transport heavy wooden boxes into the warehouses. Therefore, people's hearts are frightened and the atmosphere is serious. On the 12th and 13th, dozens of Japanese women and children took advantage of the Japanese ships Hong Kong Maru and Fengshan Maru bound for Taiwan to go to Taiwan. Japanese primary schools have virtually suspended classes. Therefore, rumors in Swatow City are becoming more and more prevalent. Fortunately, the military police are strictly guarded, so the market is as peaceful as usual. (16th)</p>

<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: The case of the boundary dispute over the Shengsi Islands between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces was forwarded by the Executive Yuan to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Interior, and the Ministry of Industry, as well as the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, for review. Each party held its own opinion, so the case was submitted to President Chiang for a ruling. It was decided that the Shengsi Islands would remain under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province. The instructions from the Executive Yuan have already arrived in the province and have been forwarded by the provincial government to the Nantong commissioner for notification. The text of the Executive Yuan's instructions to the Jiangsu Provincial Government is as follows: "Regarding the Shengsi Islands boundary issue, the case was previously submitted to your provincial government, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry for joint review. According to the reported review results, the Jiangsu Province representative proposed a boundary at 30 degrees 32 minutes north latitude (i.e., keeping the Shengsi Islands under Jiangsu's administration). The Zhejiang Province representative advocated a boundary at 30 degrees 52 minutes north latitude (i.e., assigning the Shengsi Islands to Zhejiang's administration). The representatives from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry advocated maintaining the status quo (i.e., keeping the Shengsi Islands under Jiangsu's administration). The representative from the Ministry of Interior advocated implementing the two resolutions previously decided upon at the Ministry's meetings: (1) All of Dahuanglong Island and Xiaohuanglong Island should be placed under the jurisdiction of Zhejiang Province. Tanhu Mountain and Baishan should be placed under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province. The boundary lines of all coastal islands of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces should uniformly follow the original boundary lines on the military maps prepared by the Army Survey Bureau. (2) Based on this resolution, the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Industry should jointly consult with the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments, and after consultation and reply, the matter should be submitted to the Executive Yuan for record in accordance with departmental regulations.) Each party held its own reasoning, and a resolution was submitted for the President's approval. Therefore, the status quo should be maintained, with the Islands remaining under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province. In addition to instructing the Zhejiang Provincial Government to comply, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry are also hereby notified."</p>

<p>Yao Fuqing, who operates a woodworking shop near the Xiguan Bridge in the city, had a feud with Xu A'da, a member of the Axe Gang. On the 19th, around 8 PM, Xu A'da, along with his followers Tang Guochang, Yang Longhai, and others, encountered Yao Fuqing. Xu immediately attacked Yao and his partner Yu Dabao with an axe. Yao, also prepared, took out a butcher knife and quickly slashed Xu A'da twice in the back. At that time, both Yu Dabao and Xu A'da were injured and fell to the ground. The rest of the gang immediately dispersed, and Yao also fled without a trace. The police arrived and sent the injured to Guangmin Hospital for treatment. However, Xu A'da's injuries were the most severe and life-threatening. The responsible police district took Yao Fuqing's wife, Wang, to the district and sent her to the branch bureau for questioning. They are also searching for Yao Fuqing to bring him to justice.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Changshu: Bust of Opium Trafficking Organization <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>According to a report, the County Public Security Bureau busted an illegal opium trafficking organization outside the Southeast Gate on the 19th. The mastermind was Fang Desheng, the former patrol officer of the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau. The organization was tightly structured and difficult for outsiders to detect. A minor internal conflict led to a secret report. After the Public Security Bureau's Inspectorate received the report, they first arrested Qian Yongchun at a cigarette paper shop outside the South Gate and seized twelve packages of opium. Based on Qian's confession, they then searched the home of the mastermind, Fang Desheng, and found some illegal opium, as well as three letters in his pillow that were strongly related to the illegal opium trade. Both the people and the evidence were taken to the county. Fang claimed that he only smoked the opium himself and did not sell it privately. The investigation is ongoing. Fang is from Hebei, 48 years old, and has served as a patrol officer and branch bureau chief in various branches of the public security sector. Recently, when the new Director Chen was transferred to Changshu, Fang was excluded. Because he had been in Changshu for over ten years and did not want to leave, he took this risky action.</p>

<p>The Liuhe Salt Field, established by Central Committee member Zhang Jingjiang, is quite large in scale. The salt used by salt merchants north and south of the Yangtze River is purchased from this field. Recently, feeling that the original field was insufficient, it was decided to select a site of more than 50 mu on the edge of the Goose-and-Duck Lake in Tangkou Town, the eighth district of this county, to build a new salt field. The funds were a loan of one million yuan in salt tax from the Ministry of Finance. Construction began a month ago and is now complete. The salt stored in the field is enough to supply the people of Jiangsu Province for three years. In recent days, a large number of laborers have been hired in Wuxi to transport salt to Liuhe in preparation for relocation. Zhang has also enclosed more than 100 mu of farmland in Jintan to build a Zhejiang salt warehouse. A small portion of the buildings has now been completed, and the rest will be built next spring. It is said that its scale is more than double that of the Tangkou Salt Field.</p>

<p>— Our Reporter Xiao'an</p>
<p>Guangzhou's Municipal Administration (Continued)</p>
<p>Regarding the matters of the Finance Bureau: (1) Abolishing the contractor system: In Guangzhou City, various taxes and levies have mostly adopted a contractor system. After contractors bid, they pay the treasury on schedule, and the city treasury has a fixed income, without the worry of sudden increases or decreases. However, merchants must have profits to be willing to engage in it; otherwise, no one will bid. Even if the reserve price is sharply reduced and the date is repeatedly changed, they will still wait and see. The Finance Bureau now intends to change all taxes and levies to delegated management, making them easier to organize and hoping to increase tax revenue. (2) Reducing the burden on citizens: Many taxes and levies in Guangzhou are attached with a surcharge. For example, the rickshaw tax rate is high, and overdue land taxes have penalty interest. In order to reduce the burden on citizens, the Finance Bureau is reducing and exempting these taxes separately. (3) Raising funds to repay accumulated debts: The Guangzhou City education fund has accumulated more than 500,000 yuan in debt due to insufficient treasury funds. The Finance Bureau is now planning to raise funds and repay the debts in succession. Other debts are also being resolved and cleaned up. (4) Completing the Inner Harbor Plan: The construction of Guangzhou City's inner harbor has not yet been completed. The Finance Bureau plans to continue construction to facilitate transportation and increase revenue. (5) Opening up new residential areas: Guangzhou City has a vast area and dense buildings, which is known for its prosperity. However, there are few residences suitable for hygiene. The Finance Bureau is now planning to open up several residential areas to tidy up the city appearance and improve people's health.</p>
<p>Regarding the matters of the Public Works Bureau: (1) Opening up important trunk roads in the suburbs of the city; (2) Resuming the construction of roads in the city that have been suspended; (3) Constructing Haizhu Embankment Road and various cross-roads; (4) Planning and constructing City Center Road; (5) Opening up inner streets and improving street surfaces; (6) Repairing existing road surfaces; (7) Continuing the construction of the Southwest Railway Bridge; (8) Continuing the construction of the Xinbinhua Bridge; (9) Continuing the construction of various bridges in Donghao; (10) Continuing the construction of the downstream project of Donghao; (11) Reconstructing inner street canals; (12) Cleaning up various moats and inner street canals; (13) Cleaning up road canals; (14) Continuing the construction of the municipal government joint office; (15) Continuing the construction of the municipal hospital; (16) Constructing a storage room for the municipal government joint office; (17) Continuing the construction of the Henan embankment; (18) Rectifying the business of the automobile company; (19) Strictly examining automobile driving talents; (20) Improving and adding parking lots throughout the city; (21) Planning for trolleybuses; (22) Improving the lives of rickshaw drivers; (23) Rectifying the city-run cross-sea electric boats; (24) Rectifying the electrical equipment in public places; (25) Rectifying traffic lights and watchtowers.</p>
<p>Regarding the matters of the Electricity Department: (1) Rectifying various projects; (2) Rectifying business matters; (3) Rectifying accounting matters.</p>
<p>Regarding the matters of the Telephone Association: (1) Rectifying the Foshan branch and the provincial-Foshan long-distance telephone line; (2) Repairing the machine factory and materials; (3) Adding the number of internal telephone numbers in the general and branch offices.</p>
<p>Regarding the matters of the Waterworks Department: (1) Improving household registration; (2) Increasing water volume and clarifying water quality; (3) Organizing an investigation team; (4) Relocating the chemical laboratory; (5) Constructing a material warehouse; (6) Clearing up old debts; (7) Strictly investigating water theft; (8) Reconstructing street pipes.</p>
<p>Regarding the matters of the Sewerage Engineering Department: Every year in Guangzhou City, there are floods whenever there is heavy rain. Therefore, the Sewerage Engineering Department was established to rectify this. The projects that have been determined by the department are: (1) Rectifying the upstream of Donghao; (2) Rectifying the Six Meridian canals; (3) Rectifying the Yudaihao and Xihongyong; (4) Building a tidal gate in West City.</p>
<p>The above items are the central work newly determined by the municipal government, and efforts are being made to actively implement them. In addition, there are also the Municipal Bank, the Municipal Library, and the Municipal Museum. The municipal government is also making new plans for them. As for the newly established agencies of the municipal government, there are the New Life Movement Promotion Association and the Municipal Anti-Smoking Committee. All efforts are being made. After taking office as mayor, Zeng Yangfu made a speech, roughly saying, "Guangzhou is not only the most important area in Guangdong Province, but also the hub of China's politics and economy and the birthplace of the revolution. Therefore, Guangzhou's municipal administration is extremely important. I believe that the various measures taken by the municipal administration in the past have not met the standards. Compared with Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Hankou, and other cities, they are all behind. After taking office, I am determined to make major rectifications, cut redundant personnel who waste public funds, eliminate various long-standing malpractices, and eradicate corruption, so that official governance can be clarified. On the one hand, increase funding for affairs and construction, follow the instructions of the central and provincial governments, do my best, and rely on public opinion to realize the plan to build a new Guangzhou." From this statement, it can be seen that Zeng has a clear understanding of Guangzhou and his determination to work hard on Guangzhou's municipal administration. Because of this understanding and determination, he has selected people he trusts to serve as directors of the various bureaus and committees under the municipal government, such as Liu Shixin, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau; Mai Jianzeng, Director of the Finance Bureau; Zeng Qian, Director of the Land Bureau; Ouyang Cong, Director of the Health Bureau; Lin Yimin, Director of the Public Works Bureau; as well as Zeng Qian, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government; Chen Shaoxian and Li Fang, Secretaries; Liang Bingxian, Huang Shiguang, Qiu Heqing, and Li Zaojian, Councilors. Also, the Public Utilities Bureau was merged into the Public Works Bureau, the Education Bureau was merged into the Social Affairs Bureau, and the new power plant was merged into the Electricity Management Office. Previously, the municipal government had a total of seven bureaus and two power plants; now there are five bureaus and one office. The scope of the agency seems to have shrunk, but the affairs have not been slackened. In addition, the personnel of various bureaus and offices have been reduced by a considerable amount. It is said that nearly 100 employees have been replaced in the Waterworks Management Office alone. The staff of other bureaus and committees have also been changed. This is all to put Zeng's words of major rectification and elimination of malpractices into practice.</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Bank of China and the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank have been entrusted by Shenxin Textile Company to operate its No. 2 and No. 5 factories, and a management committee will be established to preside over it. It will be announced after Rong Zongjing and others return to Shanghai from Wuxi, and textile production will begin. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Establish Management Committee to Preside Over Textile Production</p>
<p>Shenxin Factory No. 2 is located at No. 2 Yichang Road, with 56,744 yarn spindles and 7,140 thread spindles. Factory No. 5 is located at No. 1316 Huade Road, with 54,208 yarn spindles and 12,720 thread spindles. It has not been restored since it stopped work last year. Now, with the assistance of the Bank of China and the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank in the Shenxin Factories No. 1, 2, 5 and 8 Syndicate, it has been decided that the Bank of China and the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank will lend money to factories No. 2 and No. 5 again to start textile production. Shenxin Textile Company and the two banks signed a contract entrusting the management, and a management committee was established to preside over it. The members of the management committee are stipulated to be Pan Jiufen and Zhu Suwu from the Bank of China, and Zai Shouli, Li Yunhou and Tong Luqing from the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, and Rong Houren and Rong Hongyao from Shenxin Textile Company, a total of seven people.</p>
<p>The Amount of Loan Will Be Decided at Any Time</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency interviewed a bank member of the management committee last night. According to the talk, the management committee decided to announce its establishment after Rong Zongjing, the general manager of the company, and committee members Rong Hongyao and Rong Houren, returned to Shanghai from Wuxi. As for the factory directors of factories No. 2 and No. 5 and the date of commencement of work, a decision will be made after the management committee is established. The amount of the new loans from the Bank of China and the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank will be determined according to needs. However, the management committee and the Shenxin Factories No. 1, 2, 5 and 8 Syndicate are not the same agency. The syndicate is the old creditor of the past, and the management committee is the new creditor of the Bank of China and the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank. However, the Bank of China and the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank are also the largest investors in the syndicate.</p>

<p>After the yarn sales in various parts of our country turned smoothly, prices soared. The yarn inventories of various factories and exchange warehouses in Shanghai are about to be exhausted, totaling no more than 20,000 bales.

A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned the details from the yarn industry yesterday, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Turn Smoothly Suddenly</p>
<p>The reasons for the smooth yarn sales are: (1) The bumper harvest of agricultural products in various parts of our country has increased the people's purchasing power of yarn, and this is a universal phenomenon. All gangs have purchased a large amount, resulting in continuous yarn sales. (2) In the past, many yarn factories in Tianjin and Hankou stopped work for a long time, and at the same time, the factories in Shanghai unanimously reduced work, resulting in a reduction in production and a corresponding reduction in the quantity of supply. (3) The weaving industry in the inland of Jiangsu has turned better, and the cloth factories have all reported profits, so they purchased more raw materials. (4) Yarn sales in North China have been stagnant for a long time, but now they are suddenly very good.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Soar</p>
<p>Yesterday, the highest standard yarn price for the October period was 238 yuan, a huge increase of 20 yuan in nearly a week. In the past, yarn prices were low in the near term and high in the distant term, with a difference of 10 yuan. Now, on the contrary, the near term is 15 yuan higher than the distant term. This is a phenomenon of actual firmness in the market price, not a speculative rise. The current rising trend of standard yarn is still very strong, but it has not exceeded the high point in the 18th year of the Republic of China. At that time, it was 183 taels, and the current shortage of goods is more serious than at that time.</p>
<p>Yarn Inventory Decreases</p>
<p>Shanghai's yarn inventory has always been above 100,000 bales in the past. It decreased to about 50,000 bales this summer, and then decreased again in the autumn. As of now, the total is 20,000 bales (including the yarn inventory in the exchange warehouse). As for the yarn inventory in the exchange warehouse, the most was on July 24 this year, totaling 36,890 bales. It gradually decreased to 36,335 bales on July 30, 33,345 bales on August 30, 22,020 bales on September 30, and 7,410 bales on October 19.</p>
<p>Factories Rush Spinning</p>
<p>The yarn inventory of various yarn factories in Shanghai is about to be exhausted, and the amount of yarn hoarding by various households has increased. In addition, due to the lack of spot yarn, the price has risen sharply, exceeding the standard yarn by more than 10 yuan, which is a rare phenomenon in the past. In the past, in January and February, the spot yarn sales were good, and the market price gradually increased. However, due to the situation, there were many short sellers on the exchange. Recently, the situation has eased, and the number of short sellers has decreased, so the yarn has also risen sharply. The Chinese yarn factories have all opened day and night shifts to spin yarn, because at the current price, the spun yarn can be profitable. As for the factories that have stopped work, such as Shenxin Factories No. 2 and No. 5, they have obtained the assistance of the Bank of China and the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank to sort out the machinery and prepare to start work.</p>
<p>Flower Prices Are Also Firm</p>
<p>Although cotton in various parts of our country is worth a bumper harvest this year, its cotton price is also firm due to the increase in yarn. However, recently, the increase in yarn is generally greater than the increase in flowers. The phenomenon of expensive flowers and cheap yarn in the past is gradually changing, but it is still far from the constant difference between yarn and flowers in the past.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Eighty Manufacturers Gift Plaques to Wang Xiaolai, etc., Yesterday <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Eighty domestic goods manufacturers in this city, in view of the decision by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to hold a domestic goods exhibition, and with Chairman Wang Xiaolai and Vice Chairman Xu Xiaochu presiding over the proceedings, with considerable achievements, jointly produced and presented four plaques as a memento.</p>
<p>Grand Occasion of the Presentation</p>
<p>The presentation ceremony was held at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Each of the eighty manufacturers sent two representatives, who departed from the National Products Exhibition Commercial Center at 126 Jing'an Temple Road. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce specially sent four representatives to greet them. A police band led the way, followed by four ancient-style decorated floats, each carrying a plaque adorned with colored ribbons. The representatives then walked along Jing'an Temple Road, turning into Henan Road, crossing Tianhou Palace Bridge, and heading directly to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Onlookers lined the streets, creating an unprecedented spectacle.</p>
<p>Tea Reception</p>
<p>The four large plaques, inscribed with "Reliance on Industry and Commerce," "Pioneer of Industry," "Blessings of Domestic Goods," and "Skillful Promotion," each bearing the names of twenty manufacturers, arrived at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 3:30 p.m. The main gate of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was adorned with national flags. The ceremony hall was set up on the third floor. After the representatives arrived, a tea reception was held, attended by Chairman Wang Xiaolai, Vice Chairman Xu Xiaochu, Secretary-General Zhu Boyuan, members of the Chamber, and representatives from the manufacturers, totaling two hundred people.</p>
<p>Presentation Speech</p>
<p>After the customary ceremonies, Zhou Bangjun of the China-Western Drugstore, representing the manufacturers, delivered a presentation speech, stating that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in commemoration of the fifteenth anniversary of the National Products Exhibition Hall, held the Domestic Goods Exhibition, and its spirit of advocating domestic goods was truly admirable. Chairman Wang Xiaolai and Vice Chairman Xu Xiaochu led the planning, and since the opening, the results have been excellent. In order to express their admiration and appreciation, they jointly presented four plaques for permanent remembrance. The significance of the Domestic Goods Exhibition is extremely important and very necessary, as it can provide the people with a considerable understanding of what is domestic goods and what is foreign goods, and the number of domestic goods that have been produced, providing reference for buyers. Japan's industry and commerce are particularly developed, and even today, there are still slogans promoting domestic goods in the streets and alleys. He hoped that under the leadership of Mr. Wang and Mr. Xu, people would continue to work hard to develop domestic goods.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's Reply</p>
<p>Chairman Wang Xiaolai replied, stating that the ceremony of the manufacturers presenting plaques today was grand and orderly, making him and others feel sincerely honored and apprehensive. He pledged to be even more vigilant and strive for progress. The nation has a deep understanding of the cause of domestic goods. Thanks to the vigorous promotion by all sectors, domestic goods have reached this point today, and he hoped that efforts would continue to be made to survive. The most effective way to promote domestic goods is through exhibitions, allowing people to clearly compare prices and recognize goods. Before foreign goods entered the country, our daily lives, such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation, were not difficult at all. Today, we should switch to using domestic goods. Currently, our country only has light industry, and in the future, we should also pay attention to heavy industry. Gentlemen, being in the domestic goods industry, your success or failure is a matter of great responsibility. The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of everyone. Striving for progress, domestic goods will naturally develop. Now, receiving inscriptions and plaques, he is willing to serve the country with everyone in this spirit.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu's Reply</p>
<p>Finally, Vice Chairman Xu Xiaochu said in his speech that he was grateful for the trust and love, and would certainly work hard in the future. In terms of improvement, we should also promote domestic goods. Whether internally or externally, we should adhere to the principle of competition and comparison, seeking progress in order to improve the standards of domestic goods, and to enable more contact between the production and consumption sectors. After the speech, a group photo was taken, and the plaques were mounted in the Chamber's exhibition hall for permanent remembrance. He then led the representatives on a tour for a week, and the event concluded.</p>

<h3 id="e123">British Export Credits Guarantee Department: Mr. Kirkpatrick <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>According to the "North-China Daily News," the British Export Credits Guarantee Department has appointed a representative to China, Mr. Kirkpatrick. Mr. Kirkpatrick will resign his seat as a Member of Parliament to come to Shanghai, and will work closely with Mr. Peel, the Commercial Counselor of the British Embassy in China, to handle all matters. Mr. Kirkpatrick will not submit any proposals himself, nor will he seek orders. He will only inquire about the financial and economic aspects of suggestions regarding the export of British goods to China. The guarantee of loans will be based purely on commercial principles. Therefore, the facilities granted as a result are neither existing nor intended to be a subsidy to British commerce. The British Embassy in China has sent a communique released yesterday in London to the "North-China Daily News," which is transcribed as follows: The Export Credits Guarantee Department officially announces that it has appointed Member of Parliament Mr. Kirkpatrick as its representative in China. Mr. Kirkpatrick will now vacate his parliamentary seat and temporarily work at the Department's London office before going to his office in China as soon as possible. Mr. Kirkpatrick will work closely with Mr. Peel, the Commercial Counselor of the British Embassy in China, to handle all matters. Judging from the number of guarantee constructions for the export of British goods to China recently received by the Department, it is clear that British manufacturers do not want to ignore opportunities in China. However, due to the rapid changes in the situation, coupled with the time and cost required for communication, the Department estimates that there are many obstacles to the risk of loans. The Department's appointment of Mr. Kirkpatrick to China is to have a representative on the spot to examine and consider the guarantee constructions proposed by British merchants, and to make any detailed investigations that may be necessary, and to engage in negotiations if necessary. Mr. Kirkpatrick will not submit any proposals himself, nor will he seek orders. He will only inquire about the financial and economic aspects of suggestions regarding the export of British goods to China that seem to be suitable for consideration under the British export credit plan. The export of British goods to China is often within the scope of the export credit plan. The decision to appoint him now only provides a mechanism to facilitate its implementation. The operation of this plan is purely based on commercial principles and not as a subsidy to British commerce, which has long been known. The Department is only concerned with British exporters, and there is no talk of negotiating loans or credit loans with the Chinese government.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Poor Autumn Cocoon Harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang: Shanghai Factories Fear Shortage of Raw Materials; Hope That the Zhejiang Unified Committee Will Offer Spring Cocoons at a Reasonable Price; Overseas Silk Market Suddenly Rises Yesterday and Trading Becomes Active <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Due to the poor autumn cocoon harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang this year, coupled with the large-scale purchases by the Wuxi Yongtai Silk Factory, Shanghai silk factories are experiencing a shortage of raw materials and are hoping that the Zhejiang Unified Committee will transfer the stored spring cocoons to the factories at a reasonable price. The overseas silk market suddenly rose yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yongtai Silk Factory Purchases in Large Quantities</p>
<p>The autumn cocoon harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year has been poor due to the yellowing of mulberry leaves and weather conditions. The cocoons collected by silk factories and leftover cocoon merchants are difficult to profit from due to poor reeling and breakage. However, the Wuxi Yongtai Silk Factory, opened by silk tycoon Xue Shou Xuan, purchased in large quantities and offered high cocoon prices. At the same time, it purchased dried cocoons from small factories and leftover cocoon merchants. Small factories and leftover cocoon merchants believed that they would not be able to profit at the current prices of silk factories, so they were willing to sell the dried cocoons.</p>
<p>Shanghai Factories Fear Shortage of Raw Materials</p>
<p>Because of the poor autumn cocoon harvest this year and the large-scale purchases by the Wuxi Yongtai Silk Factory, Shanghai silk factories are experiencing a shortage of raw materials. Currently, forty-eight factories, including Xinglun and Xiangcheng, are operating with 11,000 machines. It is expected that after another month, they will all stop working due to lack of raw materials. Those with sufficient raw materials can only maintain operations until the end of the lunar year. Now, in order to maintain the livelihood of tens of thousands of workers, we hope that the Zhejiang Silk Unified Committee will transfer the four to five thousand dan of spring cocoons collected this year, which are stored in various warehouses, at a reasonable price to alleviate the cocoon shortage for various manufacturers. Since the beginning of autumn, the prices of overseas Chinese silk trade have gradually declined. Silk factories are unwilling to sell the reeled silk because it is difficult to profit from it. They are waiting and seeing, which has led to a sharp decrease in exports of Chinese silk. Domestic silk factories are also experiencing reduced sales due to the tense situation. However, yesterday, the prices of overseas Chinese silk suddenly rose, from US$1.62 to US$1.66, an increase of about 20 yuan per dan, which led to a smoother silk trading. Whether it can be sustained is difficult to predict.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Japanese Troops Inside the Japan Brewery in Zhabei Come and Go Without a Fixed Pattern; Patrol Teams Still Seen Coming and Going on Jiangwan Road <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese troops stationed inside the Japan Brewery at the end of Huayuan Street in Zhabei withdrew once on the 19th, and then returned to station in the afternoon of the same day. According to the investigation, the reason for their withdrawal and return was that among the more than 100 Japanese soldiers stationed there, one Japanese soldier suddenly died of an infectious disease in the morning. Therefore, the Japanese troops stationed there were ordered to withdraw completely, disinfect all parts of the factory inside and out, and even transport all military supplies out for disinfection. After completion, more than 40 troops were sent to guard the factory. At dawn yesterday, more than 130 Japanese troops, divided into several military vehicles and loaded with military supplies, drove to station. Soon, another 70 Japanese troops drove away from the factory. After 3:00 p.m., another 60 to 70 Japanese troops left the factory, and did not return until evening. Therefore, the number of Japanese troops stationed in the Japan Brewery has been reduced to 30 to 40 people, coming and going without a fixed pattern and unpredictable. As for the Jiangwan Road area in the city, Japanese patrol teams were still seen coming and going yesterday morning. The situation on North Sichuan Road is also the same as before.</p>

<p>According to a translation of an article in the French-language Shanghai Daily by the Overseas Press Agency, Colonel Hissoé, Chief Engineer of Civil Aviation of the French Ministry of Aviation, recently arrived in Shanghai with Buski, aviation advisor to the Governor-General of French Indochina, and Major General Feder, air attaché of the French Embassy. They will soon take a flight to Guangzhou. It is reported that Colonel Hissoé originally departed from Paris, traveled by plane to Hanoi in Annam, and then took a train with Buski to Yunnan, China. Subsequently, the two took a Eurasia Aviation Corporation plane to Chengdu, and from there flew to Peiping. After arriving in the old capital, Hissoé stayed at the embassy for some time, then traveled south by plane with Buski and Major Feder to Nanking. Now, they have arrived in Shanghai. It is said that after Hissoé arrived in Peiping, he contacted the Chinese authorities, during which he came to Shanghai once and stayed for a week before flying back to Nanking. After his second visit to Peiping, it was reported that he had held discussions with the Chinese Minister of Communications. During these discussions, Colonel Huang, Director of the Ministry of Communications, and Lieutenant Colonel Wang, aviation instructor, were also in Peiping and participated in the secret talks. This time in Shanghai, Colonel Hissoé also paid a visit to Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng★ General. Colonel Hissoé is a major expert in French aviation and has personally visited various countries to investigate their air force capabilities. His current visit to China shows great appreciation for the Chinese aviation industry. According to Hissoé's recent remarks, he believes that China has a real need to develop its aviation industry, because China has a vast territory, it must use airplanes to develop its transportation network. Hissoé said, "I am very interested in this trip to China, and I am very grateful for the cordial reception from Chinese officials. I am optimistic about the talks with Yu Feipeng, Wu Tiecheng★, Secretary Geng★, Colonel Huang, and Lieutenant Colonel Wang." The French authorities in China have also been very attentive to Hissoé, so he expressed his goodwill. It is heard that Colonel Hissoé once told others that he was very impressed with the construction of Shanghai's city center and admired General Wu Tiecheng's governance even more★. It is now heard that after Hissoé goes to Guangzhou, he will fly back inland and then return to Paris, France, to participate in the French Aviation Exhibition on November 20th.

Upon learning that Minister Kong was in Shanghai, he took the original plane to Shanghai and stayed at the China Hotel. Yesterday, he went to the Central Bank to meet Minister Kong★. Because Kong was unwell, he was hospitalized for treatment, so they did not meet. He is scheduled to visit again today to report and discuss funding issues before★★★going to Beijing on the same day and then to Lanzhou. Yesterday afternoon at six o'clock, Jiang Kanghu and Huang Jingwan held a banquet for Ma at the Youth Association, as Ma, Jiang, and Huang are close friends. The Xishi News Agency reporter visited Ma at his residence yesterday. According to him, he came east from Lanzhou this time to report on the progress of escorting the Master back to Tibet and to meet Minister Kong to discuss funding. Currently, Special Envoy Zhao (Shouyu) is in Lanzhou★. The Panchen Lama set off from Laji Temple in Qinghai on the 2nd of this month to Yushu (belonging to Qinghai, on the border of Xikang) and is currently on the way. The Master is now in the Golok area. Because the people along the way warmly welcomed him and urged him to lecture on Buddhism, the journey is very slow and it will take another forty days to reach Tibet★. There are a total of one hundred people escorting the Panchen Lama. Except for the Master who rides in a sedan chair, the others ride donkeys and horses. Because of the gifts contributed by the people along the way, there is a lot of luggage. It is now planned to hire airplanes from Eurasia Aviation Corporation, which requires 10,000 yuan in funding and is being negotiated with the authorities. As for the situation in Tibet, according to recent reports, the local area is quite peaceful. The authorities have also decided on the administrative arrangements for Tibet. He is scheduled to go to Beijing tomorrow and will stay for three or four days before going to Lanzhou to join Special Envoy Zhao in Xining to escort the Master into Tibet.</p>

<p>The scope of the eyeglass industry in this city is relatively small compared to other industries, so the eyeglass industry association has always raised funds from its members on a temporary basis for all social entertainment expenses. This time, the association's committee members Li Zifeng, Jia Shushi, Wu Zhusun, and Secretary Yu Shifo have been traveling in different directions for days to solicit donations for the purchase of aircraft for the birthday celebration. As a result, the amount exceeded the assigned quota by more than forty yuan. It is heard that it has been paid to the city's Aircraft Purchase Birthday Celebration Committee. If all industries in the city can be as enthusiastic as the eyeglass industry, there will be no way to defend against insults and save the country from extinction.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Trial of Minghua Bank Case Suspended Pending Zhang Gangbo's Transfer to Shanghai for Trial and Sealing <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Lawyer Li Man, the bankruptcy administrator of Minghua Bank, sued the bank's president Zhang Gangbo, assistant president Yu Dequn, and assistant manager Zhen Man for breach of trust. The First Special District Court has repeatedly summoned them and ordered Miao Wen to pay a deposit of 2,200 yuan and Yu to pay a deposit of 500 yuan to await Zhang Gangbo's arrival for questioning. This has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that Zhang Gangbo has been sentenced to five years in prison by the Qingdao District Court. Zhang did not accept the sentence and is currently appealing. The Qingdao District Court believes that it is inconvenient to transfer Zhang to Shanghai at this stage before the local judgment has been finalized and has replied to the First Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, the presiding judge held a court session again and summoned the two defendants Yu and Miao for questioning. Because Yu and Miao pushed each other regarding the bankruptcy administrator's accusations against the bank, the presiding judge believed that it would be difficult to thoroughly understand the case without Zhang Gangbo appearing in court for questioning. However, Zhang could not be transferred to Shanghai at this time, so he ruled that the trial would be temporarily suspended.</p>

<h3 id="e141">No Rain in Autumn Makes Farming Difficult Farmers Hope for Rain Soil Dryness Affects Crop Growth Pests Thrive, Growth Still Insufficient <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer this year, the climate has been mild and the wind and rain have been favorable, so crops such as cotton, rice, soybeans, etc. have grown vigorously and have had good harvests. Farmers are generally happy. However, since the beginning of autumn, the weather has been dry for nearly forty days without rain. At this time of autumn plowing, the lack of rain has caused the soil to dry out, making plowing difficult. Autumn crops such as wheat, rapeseed, and broad beans need to be sown urgently, so farmers are very eager for rain. Moreover, the vegetables planted in the fields are also affected by the dry soil, making it difficult for them to grow. The pests on the vegetable leaves are multiplying day by day. Farmers in neighboring villages, although irrigating and catching insects, are still unable to grow enough vegetables, so the price of vegetables on the market is also more expensive than in previous years.</p>

<p>Ge Guanfu, a member of the Shanghai Newspaper Workers' Union, worked in the news typesetting department of this newspaper and was a loyal worker. Unfortunately, he was brutally murdered by his wife on the afternoon of the 13th of this month. The tragic news has shocked the public, and newspaper colleagues are particularly indignant. In addition to separately requesting a strict investigation of the murderer to avenge Ge, the workers of this newspaper, because Ge was a close colleague, had always been diligent and conscientious, and was amiable and approachable, were indeed a model worker. Now that he has suddenly died tragically, they are even more saddened. It is now planned to hold a memorial meeting on a fixed date to comfort the deceased. Everything is being actively prepared.</p>
<h3 id="e143">China Merchants Bureau's Freight and Passenger Transport Increases Sharply Creating a New Record in Recent Years <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Due to various factors such as the limitations of the state-owned China Merchants Bureau, its business has been declining day by day. All those concerned about state-owned shipping are worried about it. Since the reorganization in the spring of this year, the authorities have been determined to rectify the situation, and there has been a gradual trend of prosperity. The bureau's freight and passenger transport from February to June of this year has increased, averaging about 26% compared to the same months of last year. This has been disclosed in the newspapers. It is now learned that the bureau's freight and passenger transport revenue for July increased by more than 11% compared to the same month last year. The freight and passenger transport in August increased even more sharply, with the total revenue for the month being 755,451.22 yuan, compared to 509,868.6 yuan in the same month last year, an increase of 245,582.96 yuan, an increase rate of 48%. The reason for the rapid progress of its business and the creation of a new record in recent years is, of course, the hard work of the personnel in charge of the business at the general and branch offices after careful rectification, as well as the support of the Chinese people for the government's reorganization plan, resulting in their willingness to support and assist. If the bureau continues to work tirelessly and actively expand its routes, it will surely add a different color to China's shipping industry in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Ningbo Fellow Association Investigates Zhang Mingde <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association sent a letter to the Police Department of the Public Concession yesterday, stating: "Regarding the case reported by our association member Lin Haizhou, Haizhou operates the Wufeng Wax Paper Factory at No. 4 Chengyin Lane, Fangxie Road, with a distribution office at No. 6 Jinchun Lane, No. 215 Meibaige Road. At 9:00 PM on the 17th of this month, two strangers suddenly came and claimed to be detectives from the Chengdu Road Police Station. They said that someone was pursuing your debt and asked you to go to the police station for questioning. Haizhou was shocked to hear this and was forced to leave. Two more people were waiting at the entrance of the lane. They boarded a car parked at the entrance and drove to the Chengdu Road Police Station. The car stopped in an open space. A long-faced man in a suit claimed that 500 yuan was needed to settle the matter. His words were extremely threatening. Haizhou, an ordinary person, did not know the inside story and repeatedly pleaded to reduce it to 300 yuan. He returned to No. 6 Jinchun Lane in the same car and paid 150 yuan in cash and a check for 150 yuan dated the 18th. The next morning at 1:00 AM, Haizhou, accompanied by lawyer Ye Xiabiao, reported the incident to the Xinzha Police Station for investigation. At 2:00 PM on the same afternoon, a Wu surnamed person brought the check to Haizhou for cashing. He was asked to wait a moment, and then he went to the Xinzha Police Station to invite a Western detective and detectives to come. They apprehended Wu, who confessed that he was working for Zhang Mingde, the detective chief of the Chengdu Road Police Station. Although the Xinzha Police Station has detained Zhang Mingde and his accomplice Yao Zijia, and Haizhou has identified them without error, Mingde and others have also confessed directly, but no public prosecution has been heard to this day, which is very strange. Therefore, we hereby write to your association to uphold the traditional purpose of protecting fellow villagers and grant assistance. We hereby request the Police Department of the Public Concession to thoroughly investigate and order the Xinzha Police Station to initiate a public prosecution as soon as possible, without delay, in order to uphold the law and prevent corruption."</p>

<p>The issue of the British Taikoo Company's New Beijing Ship reducing the number of workers in the middle cabin department was decided by drawing lots the day before yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Drawing Lots the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>After the Taikoo Company's New Beijing Ship was grounded, the Tongzhou Ship was renamed and put into service. The two ships had a total of 176 workers in the middle cabin department. The company authorities claimed that the ship was too small to accommodate them, so they proposed a reduction. After negotiations by the Seamen's Union, they agreed to retain 80 workers. At 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, a drawing of lots for retention was held at the Middle Cabin Office on Wangyima Lane. Secretary Wang Ji of the General Union, Section Chief Tu Yalun, Branch Director Peng Bowei, and Cheng Yongming, as well as all the workers, were present.</p>
<p>50 Retained</p>
<p>Of the 176 people, 59 did not participate in the drawing (one had already left, 18 had addictions and illnesses, 10 did not trust the union, 15 workers were from the Tongzhou Ship, and 15 were New Beijing group leaders and cadres). 117 people participated in the drawing. Of the 117 blank papers, 50 had the word "retain" written on them, and the rest had the word "dismiss". Each person drew a paper in turn. Those who drew a paper with the word "retain" would continue to serve, and those who drew a paper with the word "dismiss" would be dismissed. A total of 50 people were retained, and 96 were dismissed.</p>
<p>Severance Pay Given</p>
<p>The dismissed workers were given three months of severance pay by the business manager, totaling 48 yuan. After negotiations by the union, they were given an additional 52 yuan. The retained workers were given 20 yuan each for living expenses. The workers also contributed 60 yuan each, totaling 165.384 yuan per dismissed worker. 120 yuan was paid in advance at the time, and the remaining balance was to be collected on the 21st. By 4:00 PM, all the procedures had been completed. The retained workers continued to serve, and the rest left the ship.</p>
<p>Please Appoint a Mediator</p>
<p>For the sake of their unemployed colleagues, the workers' representatives decided on the following five measures: 1. Priority employment for dismissed workers, 2. Replacements can be made by dismissed workers, 3. The income of the retained workers will be evenly distributed among the dismissed workers, etc. However, these measures were not approved, so yesterday the workers specially sent Tu Zhenbiao and Jiang Fuji to the Ningbo Fellow Association to request Chu Qiaqing and the All Zhejiang Association to act as mediators and reduce the pain of unemployment.</p>

<p>At No. 4 Dexin Road, Zhabei, at about 4:00 AM yesterday, a case of a husband discovering adultery, killing his wife, and stabbing the lover occurred. The deceased, Cui Qiaozhen, was 20 years old and had married Bao Jingliang and had a daughter. Because Bao had an affair and did not provide support, she became involved with a Yangzhou man named Cao Wenhao. Bao discovered this, and out of anger and jealousy, he hid a sharp blade and sneaked into the house. He attacked while the couple was asleep. Cui Qiaozhen died on the spot, and the lover surnamed Tang was seriously injured. The murderer, Bao Jingliang, has been detained at the police station and will be sent to the court for questioning.</p>

The details of the interrogation have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday was the date for the verdict in this case. Those who were concerned about this case and came to court were still extremely agitated, and the Public Concession lawyer Zhang Shizhu and Chen Xiaobao's defense lawyer Yu Enliang were both present. At 9:00 AM, the judge and prosecutor Zhang Zongbei took their seats in court and announced the verdict. The main text of the verdict was that Zhang Wenhua was sentenced to death for joint murder and deprived of public rights for life, and Chen Xiaobao was sentenced to life imprisonment for joint murder and deprived of public rights for life.

<p>According to the Public Works Department Health Department, this summer, 55 Russian Boy Scouts from this city camped in a nearby area, surrounded by rice paddies and ponds. The water contained a large number of schistosomiasis-causing worms. Upon returning, 50 of the 55 children were infected with schistosomiasis. The Public Works Department Health Department considers the matter serious and has adopted a cooperative approach with the French Concession health authorities to prevent the spread of the disease. Since the families of the Russian children are mostly poor, and the thiophene agent for treating schistosomiasis is very expensive, they are unable to afford it. Therefore, they have requested the authorities to find ways to provide relief.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Theft and Copying of Lamp Manufacturing Methods - Continued Hearing of a Chinese Lawsuit - Defendants Admit to Copying - Further Investigation of the Case Pending <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Jianlin from Nanhui and Liu Ziyi from Shandong developed the Hua Yi battery safety lamp. Recently, they discovered that Gao Yushan, the manager of the Guangming Electric Lamp Factory in Dunren Lane, Avenue Dubail, French Concession, and Wu Zhirong, the supervisor, had stolen and copied the original formula that Zhu and others had registered and publicly announced with the Ministry of Industry. They illegally imitated the lamp in an attempt to profit from it. They hired lawyer Zou Shengzu to file a lawsuit with the Second Special District Court. A hearing was held once, but because the second defendant, Wu Zhirong, and the witness, Dai Fuyuan, did not appear, the hearing was rescheduled. All details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, at the prosecutor's request, the people involved were brought to the court. Judge Zhang Minsheng continued the trial in the Second Criminal Court. First, Gao Yushan was questioned about whether the Guangming Electric Lamp Factory was a cooperative venture with others or solely operated by him. Gao replied that it was a sole proprietorship. The finished products, originally stored at No. 1 Faxing Lane, Liyuan Road, had been shipped to Hubei and Henan. The judge asked if there were any documents proving business transactions, and Gao replied no. Next, Wu Zhirong testified, aged 45, stating that he did indeed copy the Hua Yi formula, and that he copied it from the Industry Gazette to show Gao Yushan. Then, the witness Dai Fuyuan testified, aged 41, from Taixing, engaged in the cloth business. He did not know Gao Yushan or Wu Zhirong. He knew them through Chen Wenfeng, his former employer. Wu Zhirong told him that there was a person named Bai Yushan who had a better lamp manufacturing method than Hua Yi. He provided a formula, made an agreement, and asked Dai to experiment with it. Dai, not knowing chemistry, did not dare show it to a third party because he was bound by an oath of damnation. Later, Wu asked him to go to lawyer Pin Xiehua to invite Gao Yushan to negotiate. Wu gave the formula to Gao, and Guangming gradually succeeded because of it. Also, because Dai was the Taixing sales agent for Hua Yi, Wu instructed him to instigate a third party, Wang, to sign another contract, fabricate facts, and file lawsuits against Hua Yi with the municipal government, the Ministry of Industry, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and the Municipal Party Headquarters to undermine Hua Yi. The draft was written by Wu Zhirong himself (evidence can be verified). Dai only submitted the document to the Social Affairs Bureau because Wu was an employee of the Social Affairs Bureau and he did not dare send it to other agencies. The judge asked if he had gone to the Guangming factory in July, and Dai replied no. The lease for the Guangming factory's building will not begin until November. After verifying the testimonies, the court concluded that further investigation was needed and adjourned the hearing to the 27th.</p>

<h3 id="e156">An Kang Foreign Firm Loses Large Quantity of Clocks and Watches - Investigation Reveals Theft by Clock Repairman - Stolen Goods Found in Pawnshop <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Yin Chunbao, 32, from Zhenjiang, opened the Ouya Clock and Watch Shop on North Sichuan Road. At the same time, he also worked as a clock and watch repairman at An Kang Foreign Firm (specializing in clocks and watches) in the Sassoon Building on Nanjing Road. All damaged clocks and watches, as well as new clocks and watches shipped from abroad, had to be handed over to Yin for repair and inspection. Recently, Pu Chunshang, the Chinese comprador of the foreign firm, discovered that many clocks and watches had been stolen. After investigation, Yin was suspected. He reported to the Chief Inspector's Office of the General Inspectorate. Chinese Detective Feng Zhiming dispatched Lin Deguang, disguised as a customer, to contact Yin, proposing to buy a high-quality wall clock. At the time, Yin did not know the plan and gave him a gold watch worth 400 yuan to inspect. They agreed on a price of 260 yuan and scheduled the transaction for 1:00 PM the day before yesterday. At the appointed time, Lin went with marked banknotes. After the exchange, Detective Feng stepped forward and arrested Yin, bringing him back to the police station. Under questioning, Yin confessed that he had successively embezzled many clocks and watches from the foreign firm. A portion of them was pawned for 300 yuan to Chen Yingsheng, an employee of the Zhenda Pawnshop at No. 465 Avenue Edward VII (Yin's father-in-law). The detectives went to recover five gold pocket watches, two clocks, and two wristwatches, totaling 2,415 yuan. Yesterday morning, they were jointly sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Ru Bao clarified the situation and prosecuted Yin for embezzlement under Article 336, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Because further investigation was needed to determine if Yin had embezzled other goods, he requested a postponement of the hearing. Questioning Yin, he confessed that the clocks and watches recovered were taken from An Kang. After Judge Feng Shide verified the confession, he ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and postponed the hearing for one week.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Book Industry Guild Holds Meeting, Passes Industry Regulations <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>This city is a gathering place for the publishing industry, but it has always upheld the spirit of mutual respect, maintaining the division of labor and cooperation for the national cultural and educational cause, without encroachment or disruption. However, in the past decade, more and more people have entered this field, and the future of the book industry has become increasingly prosperous. People have long thought about having formal regulations that are easy to follow. At the members' meeting in 1934, members such as Sao Ye Shan Fang proposed formulating industry regulations. However, the scope of the book industry is quite broad, and the nature of books varies between new and old, and the printing methods vary between letterpress and lithography. Furthermore, the same new books are divided into textbooks and miscellaneous books. The methods are not entirely the same, and the costs are also different. Uniformity is ultimately seen as forced adaptation. Three years have passed, and after repeated discussions, no results have been achieved. On July 19th of this year, at the members' meeting, the old matter was brought up again. It was decided to organize a drafting committee to draft industry regulations. Nineteen companies were selected as committee members, including Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, World Book Company, Datong Book Company, Tianming Book Company, Zhengzhong Book Company, Guangyi Book Company, Jinzhang Book Company, Huiwen Book Company, Beixin Book Company, New China Book Company, Shanggu Book Company, Wenrui Book Company, Tianma Book Company, Life Book Company, Yadong Book Company, Author Book Company, Guangming Book Company, and Shanghai Magazine. Each company sent one representative to attend, including Zhang Shuliang, Wang Zhuoqing, Lu Gaoyi, Luo Wuyai, Ding Xiaoxian, Lu Pinqin, Wei Bingrong, Yu Yiqing, Xu Baolu, Li Zhiyun, Lu Youbai, Ding Yunheng, Zhou Airu, Guo, Yan Changyan, Wang Mengzou, Huang Buxiang, Wang Zicheng, Zhang Jing, and others. Zhang Shuliang was elected as chairman, Ding Xiaoxian as secretary, and Commercial Press, Author Book Company, Huiwen Book Company, Life Book Company, and Shanghai Magazine were designated as drafting committee members. After two meetings, a draft was completed. After five meetings of the entire drafting committee, it was passed on August 18th, consisting of 53 draft articles. It was submitted to the executive committee, which borrowed the Shanghai Municipal Higher Society Hall at 1:00 PM on the 18th of this month to convene a general meeting of all members. Representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters, He Yuanming, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Yuan Hongjun, attended, along with 35 member representatives. As the quorum was not reached, Lu Feibohong, Zhang Shuliang, Wei Bingrong, Lu Gaoyi, and Zhou Airu served as the presidium. After the superiors' representatives gave instructions according to protocol, Zhang Shuliang, chairman of the drafting committee, reported on the drafting process. Then, the draft industry regulations, as well as the amendments to the draft proposed by the executive committee and member representative Zhang Xichen, were discussed in detail. The meeting was lively and lasted for more than five hours, finally concluding at 8:00 PM. A total of 55 industry regulations were established, and everyone applauded to celebrate the success. After submitting the regulations to the competent authorities for approval, they will be officially announced and implemented on a scheduled date. Furthermore, given the recent rampant piracy and disguised piracy, the executive committee proposed levying a three-month monthly donation as a temporary special donation to hire a lawyer and staff to handle piracy investigations, which was also unanimously approved.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Xu Zhengui Reports to the Defense Corps, Uses Paper Money Scheme to Capture Extortionists, Jiang Songshi and Huang Abao Also from Shaoxing, Orders Jiang to Write Handwriting Similar to the Threatening Letter <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Xu Zhengui, a Shaoxing native who runs the Ronghua Dyeing and Weaving Factory, resides at No. 1 Tongxing Lane, behind Lujia浜, Nanshi. Recently, he suddenly received two threatening letters from bandits. The wording was very intense, demanding $1,000 in silver dollars. The money was to be wrapped in newspaper at 6:00 AM on the 20th, and placed at the corner of the third street lamp wall next to the Jiuxin Enamel Factory on Zhizao局 Road, with the character "You" written on the wall as a sign. Someone would come to retrieve it. If reported to the police, they would harm his son, and so on. After receiving the letter, Xu immediately had his son, Deshun, notify the Defense Corps, explaining the situation. The third team of the Corps sent four members, along with platoon leader Chong Muqing, to accompany Xu Deshun to the designated location at the appointed time to wait in ambush. Meanwhile, Xu Deshun prepared $1,000 in paper money as instructed. Before long, two men arrived, peering around. Just as they were about to take the money, the Defense Corps members rushed forward and apprehended them. They were sent, along with the $1,000 in paper money, to the Ximen Sub-Bureau. One identified himself as Jiang Songshi, 23 years old, and the other as Huang Abao, 22 years old, both from Shaoxing. The rest of their statements were vague. Jiang was then ordered to write numbers to compare the handwriting, which was indeed similar to the handwriting in the threatening letter. As the matter involved extortion, it was deemed a serious case. Orders were given to prepare a document to be submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Home Visits and the Responsibilities of Housewives <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Visiting housewives is the most important task of the national goods movement. The Shanghai National Goods Movement Joint Association has been doing this for three weeks now, and the volunteers have visited 530 households. The ladies' tireless spirit and patient and persuasive attitude are truly admirable. However, during the visits, they have endured ridicule and sarcasm. Sometimes, they are barred by the doorman, and sometimes, they are insulted by the servants. They may even be met with cold indifference from the mistresses. Yet, they do not lose heart or become passive. They continue to do the work they should be doing.</p>
<p>Doormen, servants, and even old maids and maids have not received education. They do not know what is lovable or unlovable about a country. They only understand the power of the powerful, and act arrogantly in the kitchen and servants' quarters. Let alone other things, even if the country is lost, they will still be someone's slaves. They do not know what national goods are, and they do not have national goods in their minds. We should not blame them. Instead, we should pity them. It is a pity that they lack knowledge and humanity. Therefore, we should not expect or resent them.</p>
<p>However, the mistresses or young mistresses seem to have forgotten their own status. You are clearly Chinese, and you should use Chinese goods. Why do you like to use foreign goods? Why are you not persistent in your actions? Why do you disregard national goods and indulge in momentary pleasure, using non-national goods? When the female volunteers arrive at your home, you put on airs and act arrogant. You either say you do not have time to see guests, or you say you do not want to talk to people. This kind of behavior seems too cold-blooded and lacking in enthusiasm. Let us tell you honestly:</p>
<p>The work of these volunteers is partly for the benefit of the national goods factories, and partly for the benefit of these housewives. It allows you to seek advice, solicit your opinions on national goods, and explore your feelings about using them. Based on the opinions expressed by the 530 housewives, the association has asked the national goods factories to make earnest improvements in order to meet the expectations of many housewives. I remember that several housewives admitted that national goods are good, but the prices are not cheap. Some housewives buy things at national goods companies, but they feel that the store clerks do not pay enough attention to politeness. The female volunteers have told the association all of this so that they can discuss improvements. Therefore, if you do not speak, that is one thing. But if you speak, all the national goods manufacturers are willing to adopt your opinions. This is a great opportunity to express your opinions, which is hard to come by. Why do you reject people from a thousand miles away when they come to your door? In this light, how can Shanghai be considered civilized, enlightened, or patriotic? How can there be enthusiastic men and women? If the housewives are like this, then one can imagine what the children and servants are like. I am now telling the housewives: from now on, when female volunteers come to your door, you must receive them sincerely and discuss matters earnestly. You must express your dissatisfaction with national goods, and you must also say what you admire about national goods. This will help to create communication and unity between producers and consumers, and the national goods industry will have hope.</p>
<h3 id="e174">A Glimpse of the Anle Woolen Textile Factory <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen Sheng</p>
<p>Clothing is an important part of people's daily lives. Take wool yarn, for example. In the past, brands like "Bee Brand" almost monopolized the Chinese wool yarn market, with a history of over 120 years, accounting for 90% of imported wool yarn. How could the annual loss be less than tens of millions? "Small leaks sink great ships." This is a truly enormous loss! In recent years, domestic industrialists, seeing that promoting national goods is essential to saving the country, have established larger-scale wool yarn factories, such as Zhanghua and Anle in Shanghai, and Haijing in Tianjin, among three or four others. Through their efforts to improve quality and the enthusiastic promotion by compatriots, they have been able to recover a significant portion of these rights and interests. Take the Anle Woolen Textile Factory as an example. Its "Beauty Brand" and "Money Brand" have long been popular throughout the country. This year, they have launched a new "Hero Brand" special grade yarn. The fiber content is exceptionally long, making it durable. It can be worn until it is dirty and then retied. Even after five or six reties, there is no damage. It is cheaper and better than imported goods, if not surpassing them. The appearance of this "Hero Brand" is directly intended to counter the dumping of "Bee Brand," so that it will eventually disappear from the national goods market.</p>
<p>One clear and crisp afternoon, the author was invited by Mr. Deng Zhonghe to visit the factory. The factory is located at No. 34 Route Brenier, and the building is quite magnificent. Director Wang personally guided the tour, explaining the factory's history and sales situation. The entire process of spinning, weaving, and dyeing, including "carding, sorting, splitting, twisting, packaging, boxing," "sizing, spinning, weaving," and "bleaching, dyeing, drying," was explained step by step. According to Director Wang, after the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the market was extremely depressed. Anle, after a year of preparation, opened despite everything. Everyone, holding a spirit of sacrifice, buried themselves in hard work and struggled for five years. Fortunately, they have not been affected by the "depression," and have laid a foundation. The capital has increased from one million yuan to one million one hundred thousand yuan. Currently, business is still progressing rapidly. The entire factory has 20-30 spinning machines and hundreds of weaving machines. There are nearly a thousand employees. For raw materials, domestic sources are Jiang浙, Shandong, Tianjin, Guanneiwai wool producing areas. Foreign sources are Siberia, Australia. The new "Hero Brand" sales are very good. The previous "Beauty Brand" of grade A, the "Money Brand" of grade B, and the four and six-strand wool yarn are already in short supply, sold throughout the provinces. Even remote provinces and Southeast Asian islands are buying in large quantities. But they are not complacent. They are currently planning to add new factory buildings, purchase more machinery, and expand their scope, until foreign goods disappear and national goods are on the rise. This spirit of revitalizing national products and dedicating themselves to industry is truly admirable!</p>
<h3 id="e175">The City Chamber of Commerce National Goods Exhibition in the Midst of Extended Exhibition Period <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng</p>
<p>(Feature) I heard that the National Goods Exhibition hosted by the City Chamber of Commerce had been extended, so I quickly went for a visit. These days, the autumn weather is clear and crisp, and the exhibition venue is very lively. There are also foreign ladies and gentlemen who are flowing in and out with us, like the autumn tide and autumn clouds. The first impression is that although trade has national boundaries, the main points are the quality of the goods and the suitability of the prices. Moreover, this place gathers the first-class factories in the country and displays the first-class products in the country.</p>
<p>We were surprised and delighted to see that the light bulbs from the Ya Pu Er Electric Factory and the sofas and cushions from the An Mian Si Mattress Factory were constantly surrounded by clusters of foreign customers, who seemed happy to buy them.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the manufacturing of toys can influence children's thinking. The toys from Kang Yuan Factory are truly exquisite, like the "Rising Monkey" and "Rotating Car," which everyone likes.</p>
<p>In recent years, China's new drug industry has shown a tendency to catch up. The Xin Ya Pharmaceutical Factory and the Sino-French and Sino-Western pharmacies, which participated in the exhibition, have all received general attention. It is said that business at the venue has been satisfactory. Representatives of foreign pharmaceutical factories in Shanghai have also frequently come to offer their compliments, especially expressing unspeakable admiration for Xin Ya's products.</p>
<p>At the venue, I ran into a famous artist who was examining the display spirit and color matching of various factories. He praised the displays of Yi Feng Enamel Factory, Hua Cheng Tobacco Company, Hua Sheng Electric Factory, Tai Kang Biscuit Factory, and Tiger Brand Yong'an Hall, saying that they were very good at beautification and aesthetics.</p>
<p>The front of the venue gathers the nine famous factories, which are China Chemical Industry Society, Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory, China Enamel Factory, Hua Fu Hat Factory, Wu He Weaving Factory, Hong Xin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Ya Guang Bakelite Factory, China First Knitting Factory, and Yi Xin Toothbrush Factory. These nine factories, in Shanghai or, more broadly, in China, are planting the seeds of today's national goods prosperity. In the year after the "September 18th Incident," they boldly held an organized National Goods Store on Nanjing Road, below the tail of foreign goods. The China National Goods Company, which now occupies a prominent position on Nanjing Road, was also born from these nine factories.</p>
<p>Finally, we feel that the City Chamber of Commerce Commodity Display Hall, which initiated this exhibition, is the definite base camp for Shanghai's national goods activities. They have the spirit of fifteen years of struggle and the determination to work continuously. Yesterday, the major factories participating in the exhibition jointly made a rectangular plaque and held a plaque presentation ceremony to thank Mr. Wang Xiaoxiang, the president of the exhibition, and Mr. Xu Xiaochu, the vice president. We know that plaques are a kind of souvenir in the old society, but in the future, hanging them in the display hall will have great historical significance.</p>

<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>National Spirit! Some countries choose plum blossoms or chrysanthemums as their national flower, taking their meaning from their ability to endure frost, stand firm on ice, and be solitary and fragrant! Now, with the launch of the female volunteers of national goods, I can call them "The Flower of National Goods"! Their aspirations and actions are pure and undefiled by foreign goods, like plum and chrysanthemum flowers standing out in the wind and snow! Unyielding! National goods have their own value! And word of mouth is everything! The flower of national goods has supreme glory. Do not misunderstand that the female volunteers, representing the national flower, are flowers in a vase! Vases can only be admired! This has long been criticized. Now, the female volunteers and ladies can do solid work with their feet on the ground! Practical work! This is truly representing the flower of national goods! And they are confident of achieving complete and great results! The writer hopes that Ms. Xu and others, in their lively visits, and interactions with family men and women, will bring some dignity to their exquisite and smiling posture, so that people will respect them, and indirectly believe in national goods. Then, wouldn't the mission and responsibility of the flower of national goods be great and heavy?</p>

<h3 id="e178">Mourning Mr. Lu Xun <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>The death of Mr. Lu Xun is the fall of a giant star in the Chinese literary world, and the loss of a warrior in the cultural world. We stand on the same literary position and cannot help but express our deepest grief! Although I personally only met Mr. Lu Xun once, I can hardly claim to have any personal relationship with him. However, I have read quite a few of his writings, translations, compilations, editions, and books that he edited over the past decade. His scholarly demeanor, the transcendence of his thoughts, and his contributions to the cultural movement are all admirable and worthy of praise. Even in his later years, he maintained a consistent spirit and engaged in writing, unlike most people who become disheartened and their thoughts decline after middle age. Therefore, he was able to capture the belief of countless readers and spread the seeds of literary revolution. In recent years, especially after the national crisis, the power generated by his writings has been very strong and has won the sympathy of the general public. This is indeed his special talent. He can be considered the first person among contemporary Chinese literary giants!</p>
<p>It is often said that "literati have no integrity," so society generally looks down on so-called literati. Mr. Lu Xun was unique in his ability to be sober while others were drunk, and clear while others were muddy. He had a firm and unwavering heart and had his own central views when commenting on private matters or discussing national affairs. He was right when it was right, and wrong when it was wrong. This selfless and uncompromising spirit is also worthy of being a model for us literati. Now, there are too many clever people in China, but there are too few people who speak the truth, discuss justice, and have backbone. What I feel most sad about while mourning Mr. Lu Xun is this.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Respectfully Mourning Mr. Lu Xun <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun's creative career is not only in China, but also in the world, and it has long been well-established. We do not need to add more praise. But Mr. Lu Xun's greatness should not only be in his incomparably sublime works, which accurately reflect our era and will become eternally immortal works, but also in his lifelong spirit of going straight ahead, never retreating, "being strong towards life, struggling towards death" (in the preface to "Life and Death Field"), always being firm and unyielding, and waging a tenacious struggle against all old forces and evil forces. He has always stood on the front line of the era, fighting fiercely for our new society and new humanity. Such a great warrior of the era, from the publication of his "Diary of a Madman" and "The True Story of Ah Q" to his recent participation in the national salvation front, his battle history has never been dim. The clear and bright battles run through his entire life and become the only leader of our advancing cultural front. Today, the sudden death of such a great warrior is an irreparable loss to our vast youth and social masses! From now on, we will no longer be able to see or hear the valuable teachings of this leader of the cultural advance front!</p>
<p>From the Xinhai Revolution to the recent national salvation movement, the greatest influence on our culture and youth's thinking was Mr. Liang Qichao before the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Hu Shi in the May Fourth era, and Mr. Lu Xun from the May Fourth through the May Thirtieth to the recent period. Undoubtedly, he has directly and indirectly dominated the entire cultural advance front and is the only giant who has influenced the thinking of the vast youth masses! Many warriors of the era have retreated halfway, but only Mr. Lu Xun has never retreated for a moment, leading more youth who came later to fight fiercely for a new society and new humanity! He should be the unparalleled greatest giant of our era, and this is certain to be determined in history without doubt.</p>
<p>After mourning Mr. Lu Xun, the sole leader of our cultural front, with a heart full of sorrow, let us accept the valuable legacy he left behind, follow in his footsteps, and fight more bravely for a new society and new humanity!</p>
<h3 id="e180">"Talent of the East Gate" <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Wo Fo</p>
<p>In the present, everything old seems to have fallen, but only the "talent" is still unshakable and receives people's worship, love, and praise. Just look at those poets, writers, and artists who have long hair, are unkempt, and do not pay attention to their appearance. Are they not welcomed everywhere? Then, our Mr. Guo, who is known as the "Talent of the East Gate," has also been a talent for a lifetime and is truly worthy of pride.</p>
<p>Mr. Guo was a "Xiucai" in the late Qing Dynasty, but he got the elegant title of talent not because he passed the Xiucai exam, but because he often read his own proud masterpieces aloud in the streets and often wrote poems on people's white walls. This is something that only a talent can do. Moreover, he fully possessed all the conditions of a talent, so the title of talent could not be rejected. His expression of grief at his father's death further strengthened people's recognition of him as a talent. It turned out that after his father died of illness, he was extremely angry. When he was about to put him in the coffin, he glared angrily, almost pointing to the tip of his father's nose and said: "Why didn't you consider the time of your death first? I have only passed the Xiucai exam now, and you are dead. What glory is there in that? Why didn't you wait for me, let me pass the Zhuangyuan exam, at least get a Tanhua or Jinshi. Then you would return to heaven. Not only would your funeral be much more lavish, but I, as a filial son, could also be generous and show off a bit." He said this, and his father probably knew he was wrong and didn't make a sound. And this made his good name as a talent even more widely known; because he lived in Dongmen (East Gate), he was also called "Talent of the East Gate."</p>
<p>In addition, he spent all his travel expenses when he went to take the exam and went to the teahouse to give lectures on Liaozhai. These were all the true colors of a talent. Although he was only a Xiucai, he said that it was because the imperial examination was abolished, otherwise, he would have definitely gotten a Juren.</p>
<p>For the past twenty years, he has been constantly declining, but his life will not be a problem, because he can go to public places to tell people about the Classic of Mountains and Seas and ghosts. He also secretly does ghostwriting for high school students, so in addition to being a talent, people gave him the nickname "Walking Bookshelf."</p>
<p>Our Mr. Guo has lived his life as a talent like this.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Russian Cuisine <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>If in your life, you have not extensively broadened your knowledge of "the art of eating," you will often inevitably reveal an "outsider" air. For example, entering a Sichuan restaurant but not being accustomed to spicy food, entering a Tianjin restaurant but not liking green onions, entering a Cantonese restaurant but disliking the vegetables being undercooked or the rice being too hard, or even entering a Muslim restaurant and demanding to slaughter live eels, the jokes will only become bigger. But "learn a lesson from every fall," living in a metropolis requires learning the "rules" of "eating."</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you have eaten the cuisines of England, France, America... and other countries, or even eaten Indian curry chicken, but have never eaten "Russian cuisine," you cannot be considered to have eaten all the great cuisines in the world, and even less can you be called an "international gourmand." Therefore, mingling in the "foreign concessions," you cannot but eat Russian cuisine.</p>
<p>Even if you are not a poet, but have some poetic sentiment, you always like to stroll along Avenue Joffre, right? If you get hungry from walking and want to eat, you have to find a restaurant. There are no Chinese imperial restaurants or the like, and cafes are too aristocratic, then a Russian restaurant is the best place to go. Perhaps you will hesitate because you don't understand Russian. You can rest assured on this point. Except for the owner and the owner's wife who are truly Russian, the rest of the staff are Chinese compatriots, originally from Yangzhou, amiable and lovely.</p>
<p>Stumbling into the glass door, there is Western music broadcasted on the radio, nude oil paintings on the walls, and vases on the tables with withered flowers. The owner's wife may give you a charming smile, but you can pretend not to see it. Eating a fifty-cent meal, you can ascend the stairs to a refined seat. Asking the waiter for black bread will show that you are an "insider" because you can't find it elsewhere. Although it is harder than white bread, it is richer in vitamins and beneficial to the body. An assorted salad and a half steak. "Outsiders" may order spring chicken, but in reality, they are only gnawing on an old bone. Among them, the most flavorful is undoubtedly "Russian soup," which is plentiful, with cabbage and a large piece of beef, extremely substantial, and usually comes with pudding, fruit, and coffee. Wipe your mouth and stumble out humming the tune of "Tales of the Pavilion."</p>
<p>If a yellow leaf happens to brush your nose, then it will be even more "poetic"!</p>
<p>Correction: In yesterday's "Random Notes on Autumn Interest," the first character was mistakenly printed as "屐" instead of "徒", and the "電" in "電木" was mistakenly printed as "繽". We urgently correct these errors.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Shanghai's Scandalous Life <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Lanxin</p>
<p>Paradise is built on sin. The most wicked and abysmal metropolis is considered paradise by many. Before fantasizing about entering paradise, they have already fallen into the abyss of sin.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a paradise built on sin. A scarlet life is a path of depravity into the abyss of sin.</p>
<p>In a scarlet life, there is present laughter, subsequent melancholy, and the taste of sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and spiciness. It is a mixture of money, youth, enjoyment, and depravity. As a result, some pull back from the precipice and turn back to the shore, while others don the cloak of decadence, fall into the abyss of no return, and become sacrificial roles beneath paradise.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, many women, driven by the whip of survival and tempted by the desire for enjoyment, apply rouge and powder, wear bizarre and flamboyant clothes, are skilled at coquetry, and excel at weeping and laughing, selling their youth, bodies, and souls to obtain what they need. Some men use money as a price to buy everything from women to indulge their licentiousness and revelry. This is a buying and selling situation formed by the scandalous lives of both sexes, very much like a marketplace for both sexes.</p>
<p>Both men and women seem very satisfied when the deal is made, but after discovering the shortcomings, disputes inevitably arise. These scandalous events are broadcast in social news from time to time, just like programs on the radio, constantly changing performances.</p>
<p>Grand hotels, grand restaurants, theaters, dance halls, parks, or simply on the streets are places where both sexes perform scandalous dramas. In Shanghai, these places are well-equipped and can arrange the intoxicated men and women very comfortably, but remember not to step into the gates of the court because after passing through that gate, the scandalous drama has reached its final act and unfortunately ends as a tragedy.</p>
<p>Love can change its face. Adultery is love's changed face. The former is welcomed, and the latter is despised. In fact, they are one entity. Behind the sweet words of "I love you" is the fierce appearance of "I accuse you." Gold can buy love, and with alimony, one can commit adultery because people see your alimony and will be tempted and intoxicated to let you commit adultery, like a fish on a hook. But in the end, who is the fish and who is the hook? It is impossible to distinguish.</p>
<p>Brothels have declined, and dance pavilions stand in great numbers. What follows is the rise of escort agencies. Those young women provide escort services for men. In restaurants and hotels, what do they escort? Isn't it just acting out scandalous tricks of both sexes? The day before yesterday, someone called for the escort agency to guide his lover away, which was also a bloody news story.</p>
<p>With strong neighbors pressing the border and the situation being serious, scandalous life in Shanghai continues to be staged. I think that even on the day before the destruction of Great Shanghai, this kind of life will still exist. Paradise? Hell? Shanghai? Is it a scandalous life or a history of sin condensed from blood and tears?</p>
<h3 id="e183">Nanjing Bugs in Shanghai <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Pinluo</p>
<p>Shanghai has few insects of all kinds, almost none, but bedbugs are especially numerous, not inferior to mosquitoes in the inland. They suck fat and spread germs, a wicked virtue worthy of the saying "two luminaries of the same era," most hateful. They are great conspirators who "kill like grass without a sound," secretly and furtively engaging in activities in the dark, injuring people with hidden arrows. When the victim wakes up in extreme pain and turns on the light to catch them, they have quietly escaped without a trace—unlike mosquitoes, which make a buzzing sound similar to an airplane when they come, warning us in advance so we can quickly take precautions. Secondly, we can use mosquito nets or gauze cabinets as steel armor to resist mosquito attacks. But we have no way to deal with bedbugs, and we can only await death! Although science is now all-powerful and medicines are complete, there are "Flytox," "Fly Killer," bedbug powder, and other... various extremely powerful new weapons, but they have never been able to subdue bedbugs. They still run rampant, arrogant and reckless! Because their reproductive power is strong and fast, and they hide especially secretly, it is impossible for a small amount of medicine to universally eliminate them. Even if you poison a small part entrenched in the bedding, they can still crawl over from the cracks in the wall of the neighboring room, or cleverly detour and jump down from the roof, trying to gorge their greedy mouths and satisfy their desires before leaving. Thus, human power and pleasure are exhausted! This year, I adopted the only secret recipe passed down from generation to generation, "catch diligently," unable to sleep peacefully, and killing without mercy. For three or four months, the average number of bedbugs killed every day has been more than forty or fifty. In total, I have eliminated about fifty or sixty thousand, but I am still bitten all over, my body is covered in wounds, and I can't sleep peacefully for a single night! I remember once I went to a certain newspaper office to visit a friend, sat for five minutes, and when I was about to leave, I took my long gown from the coat hook on the wall, only to see that a dozen or twenty ambitious bedbugs had been added to the collar and sleeves. The number of bedbugs in Shanghai is truly shocking, which is something that the inland cannot match! Fortunately, bedbugs have always been called "rich bugs," and they are full of the spirit of gold, silver, wine, and meat. Perhaps the reason why bedbugs are so numerous is precisely because they are endowed with spiritual energy, and it is not a loss to be a place of outstanding people. If there were more white lice that Wang Meng scratched while sitting and unbuttoning his clothes, it would be too shabby and would inevitably become a stain on this prosperous land, greatly embarrassing the people of Shanghai!</p>
<p>I call bedbugs "Nanjing bugs." In the past, the saying often went, "Nanjing has three many: many bedbugs, many donkeys, and many expectant officials." It can be seen that Nanjing's bedbugs have long been famous both at home and abroad and appreciated by all! However, since it was changed to the new capital, the atmosphere has been completely renewed, and the past is very different from the present. Donkeys and expectant officials have both disappeared and long become historical relics. I only don't know how the rise and fall of bedbugs is, whether they also have a little sense of vicissitudes? I have not lived in Nanjing, and I don't know how the bedbugs in Nanjing compare to those in Shanghai. Are they "brothers in the policies of Lu and Wei" or "like a small wizard seeing a great wizard"? I dare not speculate or make a rash judgment as to which is superior, but I believe that the bedbugs in Nanjing, at most, will not be more numerous than in Shanghai, and the bedbugs in Shanghai, at a minimum, will certainly not be less numerous than in Nanjing. I would like to ask a few statistical experts who have lived in both Beijing and Shanghai for a long time to use their experience and insights to honestly review and compare them! It's just that bedbugs are not called "Shanghai bugs" but are called "Nanjing bugs." Is this the good fortune of Shanghai, or the misfortune of bedbugs?</p>
<p>Since last year, Shanghai has added another kind of insect, only slightly less numerous than bedbugs, which is the dung beetle that rolls dung into balls everywhere, driving them away to no avail, and also a major problem for Shanghai residents. "Where did they come from and gather here?" Everyone is racking their brains to figure out the reason for their sudden procreation, but someone checked the ancient books and thought that the saying "there are those who pursue the stench on the sea" had long existed, so no wonder "things gather by type, and they share the same stink"! Is that so?</p>

<p>Wu Xuan looked at him, still very distressed. He himself was stunned and thought for a while. At this time, he saw that Menglan's bangs covered her long eyebrows. He couldn't see what her eyes were like. He nodded a few times and said: Let's go, I'll send you back. Menglan didn't say anything, and quietly followed her brother home. When Wu Xuan arrived at the door, he whispered: I won't go in, you be as usual. Although Menglan received such an exhortation, she still had a knot in her heart. At noon, she felt even more uneasy, so she broke the rule and took the initiative to go to Li Youmei's house to talk to him. Unexpectedly, when she arrived at Li's house, their maid gave a very tempting reply, saying that he had gone to a relative's house, the Zhang family. Menglan thought for a while, did not want to wait, and returned disappointed. What Li's maid said was true. Youmei was also a little doubtful why Menglan seemed a little uncomfortable when she talked about Zhang Litian. Although he didn't say anything, he could see the clues if he went to Zhang Litian's house to take a closer look. With this in mind, he brought a little ordinary socializing from his family and came to Zhang's house alone. On this day, the weather at noon was very promising for summer. Youmei held a cloth umbrella and walked on the road, as if feeling a heat wave rising from the ground and attacking people's bodies. When she arrived at the Zhang family, the two old trees in their courtyard made half a courtyard of cool shade. Although some sunlight was revealed in the leaves and scattered on the moss-dotted brick ground, making white patterns, there was a cool breeze blowing on people, naturally clearing and cooling people's troubled minds. Youmei put away the cloth umbrella and stood in the courtyard, first calling out "Aunt." Mrs. Zhang felt that such long summer days should not be wasted. She held a piece of old clothes and slowly sewed it under the window, where there was a cool breeze. Turning her head and seeing that it was Youmei, she called out "Miss Li" and welcomed her into the courtyard. She smiled and said: Sit in the hall? Or sit in the room? Female students are not afraid of people. The hall is cooler, so sit in the hall. When Youmei arrived in the hall, her eyes were already shooting around. She saw a lacquered bamboo curtain hanging outside the door of Guoqi's room. It was not very clear to see from outside the curtain, but she faintly smelled a scent of sandalwood coming from inside the curtain, and she could not see a trace of smoke between the inside and outside. Because she said: Aunt's house is clean everywhere. Answer with seat (87)</p>

<h3 id="e185">Yarn Flower Speculation Brings Unexpected Surprises, Yarn Market Wildly Rises and Plunges, Monthly Peak Reaches 38 Yuan, Shorts Heavily Add to Positions in Distant Months, Near-Term Rises 8 Yuan, Distant-Term Falls Approximately 5 Yuan, Spot Sales Stagnant Due to High Prices <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the yarn and cloth market and the yarn flower market have been turbulent. General speculators are extremely hot and restless. With sudden rises and falls, the trend is chaotic. Both large longs and shorts have considerable opposing force. Trading is prosperous. Therefore, it rises on one session and falls on the second, and the momentum is fierce, making it difficult to resist. Initially, the upward trend of the October contract reached the limit on the previous day. Checking the actual chips, there were still 12,000 bales remaining. The shorts rushed to cover, jumping 10 yuan to 238 yuan. Because its upward momentum was too激, it was not far from the spot yarn price. Also, because the spot yarn asking price was too high, the customers were sluggish. Thus, the popularity gradually calmed down. The November contract had a gentle upward force, rising only 3.1 yuan. The remaining distant contracts fell sharply by 3.5 yuan. It was said that the Qingdao yarn market fell by more than 10 yuan, and it was also said that foreign firms were selling. In fact, the price has reached a high level. The momentum is certain. The longs took the opportunity to take profits and挫. In the afternoon, it still changed uncertainly. According to market observations, most of the floating shorts have closed out. The market price has soared by more than 30 yuan. Although the longs continue to猛抬, there may be temporary reactions. How the future will be depends on the actual needs for transference.</p>
<p>Floating Longs and Scattered Shorts Have Been Concluded</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard yarn market, the current month rose sharply by 10 yuan to 238 yuan due to the previous day's limit up, and the shorts were extremely panicked. The November contract rose more slowly, rising by 3.1 yuan. The distant month suddenly became tired, falling by 3.5 yuan. Although the spot yarn price is high, sales are sluggish because the price is too high. Thus, the shorts heavily sold in the distant month, and the floating longs concluded their positions. The market then turned sharply downward. In the second session, the near-month also declined. As a result, the current month rose by 4.5 yuan from the previous day's closing price, and the distant month fell by 1.9 yuan to 5.2 yuan. In the afternoon, the market opened again at 4 o'clock. The current month continued to fall by 1.6 yuan, but the distant month was slightly stronger. Unexpectedly, 1,600 bales of the 38th contract in the current month were purchased, and the price jumped 7.1 yuan, reaching 38 yuan again. The remaining months also rose by 1.7 yuan to 3.1 yuan, but the last two months were unchanged. It is said that the shorts continued to sell in the distant months. In the third session, the current month suddenly fell by 2.2 yuan, and the distant month also fell by 1.2, 3, and 5 jiao. The closing prices of each month rebounded slightly. As a result, the current month rose another 2.5 yuan from the morning closing price, the November contract rose another 2 yuan, and the distant contract rose or fell by 2 or 3 jiao. The market closed at 7:30. The actual sales were 3,200 bales for He Xing, 6,300 bales for Geng Feng, 3,200 bales for Sen Kang, 1,100 bales for Chang Yu, 3,050 bales for Ren Feng, 1,100 bales for Tai Chang, 3,650 bales for Run Kang, 1,750 bales for Fu Kang, 3,100 bales for Rui Da, 3,700 bales for Shen Ji, 2,000 bales for Da Chang, 1,500 bales for Yong Chang, and 2,150 bales for Tong He. The purchases were 4,500 bales for Yu Da, 2,150 bales for Heng Yi, 1,450 bales for De Da, 2,000 bales for Mei Ji, 2,650 bales for Tong Ji, 4,200 bales for Ming De, 1,750 bales for Yi Cheng, and 3,650 bales for Chang Feng. , 2,450 bales for Xin Cheng. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Prices Are Also Extremely Chaotic</p>
<p>The spot yarn sales have turned clear. The spot yarn market prices are chaotic and irregular. The total transaction volume for the day was 1,045 bales. The selling prices often differ by 4 or 5 yuan, which is not surprising. This shows that people's minds are divided. As a result, the average price fell by 3 or 4 yuan compared to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each gang are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland: 830 Shantou: 10 Fellow traders: 65</p>
<p>Changsha: 40 Xuzhou: 80</p>
<h3 id="e186">Increased High-Priced Arbitrage Sales, Raw Cotton Follows Yarn Market Reaction <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is calm due to the stability of overseas cotton industries, coupled with the frequent fluctuations in yarn prices. People's minds are weaker. Most people still intend to sell at high prices, believing that the year is a bumper harvest. However, the demand for spot cotton is still strong, but it is not as firm as the yarn market.</p>
<p>Distant Cotton Purchases Decrease by 1 Yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard flower market, the cotton market was even more depressed due to the stability of the US and Indian cotton markets and the decline in distant yarn prices. The selling momentum was strong, and the market fell sharply by 5 or 6 jiao. The first session was flat. Until the third closing session, the market price decline rose. The result of the standard flower market was that each month fell by 7 or 8 jiao to 9 jiao and 1 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. At the opening in the afternoon, the trend was slightly stronger. The market tightened as the longs came to buy again, rising by 2, 3, and 4 jiao. Unexpectedly, cotton merchants came to arbitrage sell and returned slightly. By the second closing session, the shorts were slightly stronger in covering their positions. As a result, each month rebounded by 5 fen to 2 jiao compared to the morning closing price. The sales were 16,600 dan for Yu Da, 5,700 dan for Jin Chang, 20,300 dan for Geng Feng, 6,700 dan for Shen Chang, 6,100 dan for Yu Chang, 2,400 dan for Sen Kang, 6,000 dan for Feng Tai, 6,400 dan for Shen Ji, 6,000 dan for Ren Feng, 7,500 dan for Run Kang, 6,200 dan for Heng Chang, 9,400 dan for Fu Kang, 2,900 dan for Yong Da, 2,800 dan for Xin Chang, 8,800 dan for Chang He, 6,500 dan for Ming De, 3,700 dan for Zhen Da, 4,100 dan for Yi Cheng, and 4,000 dan for Da Chang Cheng. The purchases were 7,900 dan for Tai Chang, 4,000 dan for Xin Cheng, 15,300 dan for Chang He, 3,400 dan for Ji Feng, 2,900 dan for Tong Ji, 3,400 dan for Heng Yi, 3,800 dan for Ju Xing, 12,500 dan for Da Feng, 4,600 dan for Yuan Da, 15,100 dan for He Xing, 5,200 dan for Wang Tai Xing, 6,100 dan for Chang Feng, 7,700 dan for Xie Cheng, 4,300 dan for Sheng Yuan, 4,600 dan for Jing Hua, 6,000 dan for Tong He, and 4,900 dan for Yi Kang. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices of the day are listed left.</p>

<p>Yesterday, at the opening of US cotton, each month rose or fell by 4 pounds. Trading was active. Cotton farmers sold, and the industry and foreign firms bought. Then, due to continued arbitrage selling in the South, the market price slightly returned. New cotton movements increased, showing the accuracy of the government's estimated quantities. The spot cotton foot is firm and expensive, and domestic demand is good. The cloth market is also active. The weather forecast is good in the East, clear in the Central tonight, cloudy on Tuesday, clear tonight in the West and East of Texas, and cloudy in the rest. There may be rain in the West of Peiheng Tuer and Oklahoma. The closing was calm. Spot goods fell by 7 pounds, and futures rose by 1 pound to fall by 7 pounds. British spot goods fell by 2 points, and futures were unchanged. Indian cotton was initially tired due to long position closing, and then rose due to exporter purchases and cotton field quantities not being as much as expected. Finally, it was tired again due to futures traders selling. Pinggeer fell by half a rupee, Aomula fell by 1 rupee, and Bairuoxi fell by 0.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated 19th).</p>
<p>According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast on the 20th was: Bairuoxi at 223 rupees, down half a rupee, Aomula at 200 rupees, down 0.25 rupees, and Pinggeer at 159.5 rupees, down half a rupee.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Sanpin Yarn Rises, Cotton Tires <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>According to the Osaka telegram on the 20th, Sanpin futures yarn rose by 1.5 yuan to 2.5 yuan. The near month was 218.7 yuan, and the distant month was 208.5 yuan. Futures cotton fell by 1 jiao to rise by 5 fen. The near month was 67.7 yuan, and the distant month was 66.75 yuan.</p>

<p>According to the Bombay telegram on the 19th, the amount of cotton exported from the Rangoon side last week totaled 108 tons, of which 45 tons went to Hamburg and 63 tons went to Kobe.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Piece Goods Printed Velvet Sees New High, Up One Jiao Per Yard Compared to Early July Opening <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sharp rise in the cloth market was even better. Raw material yarn and thread were unavailable, and fine yarn was even scarcer. Even at high prices, they could not be found. Moreover, the price of thread has recently soared, causing the market to absorb some of the spot cotton cloth. Selling has increased step by step, and no consideration is given. Recently, the Hankou gang has been absorbing the most. Printed velvet has risen faster and faster. Yesterday, it has reached the peak of 2 jiao and 6 fen (per yard), compared to the initial opening price of 1 jiao and 6 fen (per yard) in July of this year, a difference of 1 jiao (per yard). Based on the original box of 1,410 yards, it has risen by 141 yuan per piece, which is truly an unprecedented record. The current factory price has increased to 1 jiao and 7 or 8 fen (per yard). White goods and colored goods also rose across the board yesterday, (per piece) 4 or 5 jiao or so, with varying absorptions in each market. The market is too激, prevent its reaction, and the purchase price differs too greatly in the same sales area. Therefore, the purchase of goods is also very hesitant, and futures are even more unacceptable. White factory heavy coarse cloth, Shenxin, Yu and other factories have released 6 or 7 hundred bales, and Japanese factories have released more than a thousand pieces of fine cloth, market cloth fine twill 84 cloth, and printed Zhigong serge. The futures asking price is slightly flat, and the spot goods are the most smart.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Plaid Woolen Fabrics Sold As Soon As They Arrive <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Plaid woolen fabrics are currently popular. Men's and women's colored suits and general goods are selling. The sales of large plaid are even faster. Medium plaid market sales are also wide. Although the price continues to rise, the demand from buyers is still endless, causing the East and Four goods to arrive and collaborate. The products of Xinguo goods are competing for each other. The trend is smart, which is difficult for any goods to compare with today. In short, now there is a fresh plaid woolen fabric sample found. Except for the square eye, which has been closed, most of the street runners want to snatch it.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Zhabei Goods, Fungus, Hankou Market, Rapid Price Increases <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday's Hankou telegraph, the price of fungus from Xing'an and Hekou has skyrocketed by nearly thirteen yuan. The previous market price was 84.60 yuan, but yesterday's telegraph showed it had risen to 97 yuan, and the market momentum remains tight. Shanghai's market has therefore been greatly boosted, with brokers uniformly calling for higher prices. If sales remain strong, there is hope for continued tightening.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Securities - Bond Market Rises, Both Long and Short Sides Are Swapping, Market Price Rises Five Cents to Six Jiao <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, the market started well but then faltered. There was no clear performance in the market, and it remained volatile and uncertain. Both long and short sides of the market had their own opinions and perspectives. Therefore, the market price rose and then fell, without any firm signs. Most transactions in the market were swaps, and very few new buy-sell orders were executed. The future prospects remain uncertain and volatile. Yesterday's trading saw active buying of numbers 32 and 45, as well as by various individual investors. Only number 5 saw more selling, with high prices rising sharply, by between 1 jiao and 5 fen to 6 jiao and 5 fen. The final trading became weak, and transactions were also thin, mostly down by 5 fen to 1 jiao. The afternoon opening saw more swap transactions, with number 52 seeing significant selling. Except for the A and B types of current month contracts, which rose slightly by 5 fen, the rest continued to fall by 5 fen, 1 jiao, or 3 jiao. The closing price was still volatile and uncertain, with long and short positions swapping, taking different positions, and the market price fluctuating up and down. The final result was an increase of 5 fen, 1 jiao to 6 jiao, with a total transaction volume of 8.3 million yuan. The results of the price changes are compared and listed on the left. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<h3 id="e196">Grain - Flour Price Sets New Record <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw prices rise across all months, setting a new record. Before the abolition of the tael and the adoption of the yuan, the highest price was 2 taels, 6 qian, and 8 fen. Today, the forward price has reached 3 yuan and 8 jiao, equivalent to 2 taels, 7 qian, and 3 or 4 fen. Therefore, the current situation is extraordinary. It is said that the harvest this year is abundant, but this phenomenon is inevitable. It is unknown how those advocating for exports will manage the aftermath. At the beginning, the market felt calm because foreign wheat quotations had decreased slightly by about 4 jiao. However, large players outside the industry, due to various reasons, made every effort to push prices up, resulting in brisk trading, with 700,000 to 800,000 bags traded in half a day. The market also rose by 2 to 4 jiao and 4 fen. When the afternoon session opened, short positions in the current month, due to its proximity to delivery, were aggressively covered by both industry insiders and outsiders, leading to a surge in the market. Although market sentiment was also high for forward months, factories continued to sell to hedge, and stability was seen amid the firm trend. The repeated increases at present may lead to significant reversals in the future when prices approach those of foreign wheat.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Futures Wheat Entirely Speculative <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market opened strong in the morning, then stabilized, and then rose again. Initially, due to the anticipation of a large jump in recent cotton yarn prices by outside players, market sentiment was also high when prices opened, with both near and far terms rising by 5, 6, or 7 fen. Then, industry insiders, due to foreign wheat declining for two consecutive days, sold off their floating positions, causing market sentiment to gradually decline, falling back by 3 fen compared to the opening price. When the afternoon session opened, trading in the near term was quiet, and prices did not fluctuate much. Due to the resurgence of the flour market, prices rose by 2 or 3 fen. In February and March, due to active buying by outsiders, prices rose by 5 or 6 fen. In the current situation, there is no longer any reason or logic, and it is purely speculative. The supply of current wheat is very scarce, and sellers continue to raise prices. Yesterday, high-quality wagon wheat opened at 5 yuan and 5 jiao and a half, which was more expensive by nearly 1 jiao, but factories disliked the high price and unreliable quality, so their interest waned. Only Shen Dacheng traded a few hundred bags for the whole day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, although the early indica rice market was strong, southern routes were smoother, and market sentiment progressed accordingly. Cantonese merchants focused on coarse indica rice, and the market for coarse indica rice became tighter as daily arrivals were fewer. Yesterday, the market rose sharply by 1 jiao to 1 jiao and a half. Milled rice was traded smoothly in Shantou, and there were also inquiries from the North, so the market also moved upward, with prices rising gradually by 5 or 6 fen to about 1 jiao. Yuan rice, broken rice, and rice bran only rose by 3 to 5 fen. Yesterday, 6900 bags of Jiangxi rice, 3637 bags of Hunan rice, 1220 bags of Taiwanese indica rice, and 176 bags of Beijing coarse rice were sold.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Seed Rice Unique in Short Supply <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, there were over twenty sources from various regions, with a total of over 4000 shi of goods. However, local sales were also sluggish, and only bagged rice was relatively active. About 400 bags of new thin paddy rice from Qingdao, Beiping, Tianjin, and Dalian, 700-800 bags of thin broken rice, and 200-300 bags of thick new japonica rice were traded. As a result, the price of thick new japonica rice fell by 9 fen, while seed rice, due to lack of supply, rose by 5 fen. There was not much demand for Baige rice, and the route for Songyang pointed rice suddenly became popular, with prices rising by 5 fen to 1 jiao. Thick and thin broken japonica rice, because of the issued orders, although actively traded by guest merchants, were unable to raise prices and remained neutral. New Yin Qian rice was still tight.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, there were thirty-six or thirty-seven sources from the river region. Various types of rice in the market were sold, and new japonica, Yang Du, and Du Jian picked up some sales. Broken japonica rice was sluggish, and the remaining goods were mediocre. Market conditions saw the price of new japonica rice weaken by several fen to nearly 1 jiao, and the price of broken japonica rice fell by about 1 jiao. Yang Du Jian became the regular product of Qianyuan guest merchants, and the price of Du Jian repaired by 4 fen. Guest Dong rice was in short supply and there was no market. Old thin paddy rice had not yet opened for sale.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Yellow Beans Controlled by Dalian <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yellow bean market was supposed to be tight due to lack of supplies, but after telegrams from Dalian reported continued declines, market sentiment in this city softened. Suddenly, one less major oil pressing factory was trading in the market, and other sales routes also decreased. The entire market only sold 1400 bags of late Jiujiang beans and Hangkou beans and 700 more bags of Pillow beans, yellow sand, and autumn beans. The market situation outwardly looked like it wasn't bad, but in its bones it had relaxed considerably. At the end of trading, a factory bought a wagon of Lin Huaiguan beans, for the price of 5 yuan, 3 jiao, and 4 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e200">The Radical Cure for Gonorrhea in Germany <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Several unreasonable treatments that must be taken seriously… The Gonorrhea Prognosis Institute has convened five meetings in two months… For the distinction of pseudo-cures, patients should have sufficient common sense to avoid wandering down divergent paths.</p>
<p>The treatment of gonorrhea is one of the most difficult problems to solve because its initial infection is due to gonococci invading the urethral mucosa. However, after a few days to two weeks, the gonococci enter the bloodstream from the mucosa and spread throughout the body. At this time, if local therapeutic drugs are taken again, their effectiveness is simply equal to zero. However, previous treatments all adopted local urethral permeation sterilization. Think about it, even if local gonococci are removed, how can the dangers of systemic gonorrhea be prevented? This is one of the unreasonable treatments. Fortunately, this treatment has been completely declared a failure. This is already a fact known to readers.</p>
<p>However, because Europe is a region where venereal diseases are prevalent, due to environmental needs, there is a group of conservatives who advocate a compromise approach, advocating permeation sterilization combined with antitoxin therapy. This treatment, which is neither fish nor fowl, has long been despised by informed people, and tens of thousands of patients have been harmed by it every year. The basis of this therapy is only to imitate Dr. Biedl's theory of gonorrhea treatment. This is truly "drawing a tiger but ending up with a dog". Dr. Biedl is the director physician of the Gonorrhea Department of the Berlin Venereal Disease Hospital. Based on years of painstaking research in clinical experiments and chemical laboratories, he invented "Krellinon," made of protein bodies and yellow pigment, which is specially used for acute and chronic turbid discharge of men and women with gonorrhea. It has unique efficacy and no side effects. After taking it, it can enhance the special anti-gonorrhea factor in the body, making the greatest function of eating and eliminating gonococci occur. Therefore, after being cured in a short period of time, it can be completely cured and never relapsed. However, women's leucorrhea should be used with "Carl Schädlich" externally. According to Hunter, a reporter from the Berliner Abendpost: Montrea, director of the Berlin Gonorrhea Prognosis Institute, strongly promoted "Krellinon" in 1934. And in the spring of this year, he held discussion meetings five times in two months to seek to ban inferior drugs that imitate and mislead people. It is heard that the official has now banned it, and the whole of Europe has regarded "Krellinon" as the norm.</p>
<h3 id="e201">The Maintenance Technique of Love <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Zhonglin, Doctor of Medicine, graduate of Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>How to maintain your youth? First, cure your illnesses!</p>
<p>"When people get old, their beauty fades." This sentence is very scary for women, because women are easier to age than men. Therefore, the love between the two sexes often breaks down halfway. But what is the reason for this? Probably premature women, nineteen have menstrual disorders, unsound ovarian function, and breasts and hips that cannot reach a healthy state. And because of this, neurasthenia, anemia, insomnia, irritability, depression, and increasing the morbidity, the jade face is emaciated, haggard and moving, the hair is yellow and falls out early, and the muscles have wrinkles covering the forehead due to relaxation. Even the eyes have lost their moving radiance. This is completely an old state. May I ask, can love still be maintained?</p>
<p>This disease is not only premature but also has the danger of infertility, so the family will have a more uneasy atmosphere. From the experiments of many people, any woman with any of the above symptoms can take the drug "Bu Nü Rong" because this drug adjusts the ovaries, increases new blood, promotes the vigorous function of metabolism, and has the effect of enriching muscles. Therefore, those with irregular menstruation can become pregnant due to regulation. And the nerves are also strengthened, and the lost youth can be recalled. After taking it, the skin is as delicate as solidified fat, and the face is plump and beautiful like an apple color. It not only has the effect of curing diseases but also has the effect of prolonging youth. Therefore, "Bu Nü Rong" is actually the key to maintaining love. However, if women also suffer from leucorrhea, they can also use "Carl Schädlich's vaginal tablets" as suppositories to remove leucorrhea. It is a more comprehensive treatment inside and out.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Gonorrheal Arthritis <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Yao Juyan</p>
<p>If not treated promptly, it will lead to disability</p>
<p>Patient Zou Simeng, 28 years old, suffered from arthritis after suffering from gonorrhea because he did not abstain from alcohol and labor. In the foot, knee, wrist, elbow, and scapula joints, all had pain, followed by swelling, swelling, and fever. If he occasionally worked, the pain in the knee joint was unbearable. The exudate from his joints had a tendency to turn into pus. I used a needle to extract it and examined it. It was found that there were countless gonococci and pus blood cells attached and growing together (as shown in the first picture). After urgent anti-gonorrhea serum and electrotherapy, one prescription was "Krellinon" to reduce inflammation, relieve pain, reduce swelling and prevent corruption, and destroy gonococci. After three weeks of treatment, the joint swelling and pain had gone seven or eight. After continuing to take "Krellinon" for two weeks, the swelling and pain were completely healed, and the arms, wrists, elbows, and knees could be extended and rotated freely. Re-testing the blood with a needle revealed no traces of gonococci (as shown in the second picture). If Zou Jun's disease is not treated promptly, once it becomes joint stiffness and cannot move, it is the same as being disabled. However, this disease is difficult to completely cure if "Krellinon" is not taken. Because this drug has the effect of making the whole body produce anti-gonorrhea factor, so that extensive gonococci can also be encapsulated and eaten, with no omission. If you take local permeation sterilization drugs, you will definitely fail. How can you not be careful in using drugs! All patients who have suffered from gonorrhea, whether superficially cured or not, can take "Krellinon" to prevent and cure if they feel joint pain. Avoid trending to deterioration.</p>

<p>— Yang Daonan, Doctor of Medicine, graduate of the Russian Labor Medical University</p>
<p>Forgetting one's own life when masturbating, but regretting it very much afterwards</p>
<p>When young, there is no gambling on life that is as terrible as the bad habit of masturbation. In that moment of excitement, one forgets one's precious life, but afterwards, one regrets it repeatedly. This will not only weaken the sexual nerves but also make the entire nervous system unsound. Because masturbation (self-indulgence) probably starts mostly in the developing youth, cutting off a good youth gland, stopping its development halfway, and all sexual tissues lose their normal state. Therefore, there are short reproductive organs, almost no different from children, followed by spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, insufficient erectile strength, thin semen, prolonged infertility, and headaches, insomnia, palpitations, forgetfulness, anemia, emaciation, aversion to things, melancholy, pessimism, and other symptoms.</p>
<p>We want to say to save him, we must not forget the method of transforming sexual system tissues. According to Professor Condorcet of France: To transform sexual system tissues, there is no other drug to take except "Boti Kang". Because "Boti Kang" is refined from the endocrine of animals in puberty. After taking it, it can promote the vigorous secretion function of the sex glands and thoroughly transform the entire organization of the reproductive system. Therefore, not only is the lower part developed and healthy, and the erectile strength is strong, but all sexual neurasthenia such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and headaches, blurred vision, insomnia, forgetfulness, etc., can be cured at the same time. However, if you have spermatorrhea, you can take "Nairis Spermatorrhea Tablets" at the same time, which will take effect faster. This is a fact proven by thousands of people. According to Dr. Condorcet, I was a professor at the Russian Labor University School of Medicine, and my favorite "Boti Kang" and "Nairis Spermatorrhea Tablets" were also instructed by the doctor. Since returning to China, "Boti Kang" has cured sexual diseases caused by masturbation in young people, and its excellent results are unmatched by any other drug. Because its medicinal properties are orthodox and its efficacy is lasting, these points can also be proven.</p>

<p>How to Save Gonorrhea that has Turned into a Bad Disease</p>
<p>Gonorrhea that is not treated is most likely to turn into a bad disease. The reason is that gonococci are rich in strong and tenacious anti-toxicity, and they are also good at scurrying, like bandits, destroying tissues everywhere. Although the symptoms are very dangerous when first suffering from gonorrhea. But if treated properly, it will never turn into a bad disease. However, experience tells us that because patients have weak will and mistakenly take inferior drugs, leading to the introduction of poison, or because doctors' surgery is not good. It can also make the condition change and become difficult to treat. Gonorrhea is not a bad disease, covering the above two ends.</p>
<p>All gonorrheal arthritis, orchitis, septicemia, endocarditis, urethral stricture, prostate leakage, etc. can be regarded as bad gonorrhea. If it is mild, you will suffer from the disease for life, and the poison will infect your wife and children. If it is severe, your life will be cut short, which is very scary. There is Qi Kaitai, who lives in Nicheng Bridge, who is 25 years old. He has been suffering from gonorrhea for many years. He mistakenly took inferior drugs first, and then mistakenly performed crude surgery, which worsened his condition. He was in a panic. Fortunately, he bought my "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" at the Dadong Bookstore. Knowing that I am good at treating gonorrhea, I asked me to treat it. After diagnosing it, I had become prostate leakage and had infected his wife. In addition to local surgery and electrotherapy, I instructed him to buy "Krellinon" at the Sino-Western Pharmacy and take it to make his body produce anti-gonorrhea factor to eat bacteria and treat it fundamentally. After five weeks of continuous treatment, the prostatitis has been completely cured, and urination is quick and easy. Only the glands have been destroyed by gonococci, so I instructed him to take "Boti Kang" internally for two weeks to heal, and after examination by X-ray, the glands recovered and were healthy as before. His wife's leucorrhea, in addition to instructing her to take "Krellinon", externally used "Carl Schädlich vaginal tablets" as suppositories to remove leucorrhea, which also healed in four weeks. It is difficult to save this bad disease unless this treatment method is followed.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Mental and Physical Labor Are Both Causes of Lung Disease <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Original author: Kaczorowski M.D., Translated by Deng Yuanhe, former professor of Nanyang Medical University and director of the Hu Nan People's Hospital</p>
<p>… Writers, coolies, athletes, and artisans are most likely to suffer from lung disease … Young people who are addicted to masturbation and suffer from spermatorrhea can be invaded by tuberculosis bacteria … Catching a cold in the cool autumn season will inevitably lead to prolonged illness and consumption</p>
<p>Lung disease is completely different from ordinary diseases. General diseases are acute, while lung diseases are acquired unconsciously. It occurs slowly, and the symptoms will not be obvious until the tuberculosis bacteria erode the lungs and become lesions, and the person's resistance is on the verge of exhaustion. People who use their minds and sit still are very likely to get sick because they do not exercise, so their resistance is weak. However, excessive exercise or labor will also affect the lungs and give tuberculosis bacteria an excellent opportunity.</p>
<p>In the cold autumn, people are most susceptible to colds, and the cough and sputum of colds are evidence that the trachea is sick. This is the precursor to consumption. Of course, there is a fundamental remedy for colds and coughs, which is the special lung tonic "Bu Fei Nair", but the sooner you take it, the better.</p>
<p>Secondly, young people indulge in masturbation and waste semen, which leads to physical weakness and no resistance. This is also the cause of lung disease. In addition to taking "Nairis Spermatorrhea Tablets" to treat spermatorrhea, it is best to take "Bu Fei Nair" to treat consumption. According to the research of Wu Guo's most famous experts, "Bu Fei Nair" is as effective in treating consumption as quinine is in treating malaria. All symptoms such as hemoptysis, sputum, night sweats, tidal fever, chest pain, and reduced appetite can be completely cured in the shortest possible time after taking it.</p>

<h3 id="e208">A Discussion on Self-Treatment for Leukorrhea <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>Leukorrhea is often regarded by women as a private illness, hence the reluctance to speak of it openly, leading to prolonged conditions and deeper decay. Some develop ulcers, others experience uterine bleeding. All these ailments interfere with sexual activity and urination. Abdominal swelling and pain, irregular menstruation, and inability to conceive are common. Therefore, prompt treatment is advisable. However, due to shyness, many hesitate to seek medical help. In such cases, using German "Card Snowflake Vaginal Tablets" as pessaries is recommended for antiseptic, anti-discharge, and bactericidal effects. Continuous use for three to four weeks can lead to complete cure, leaving the vaginal area clean and fresh like a virgin's, with the lesions completely healed. For cases caused by gonorrhea or other venereal infections, "Kelinong" can be taken simultaneously to kill internal gonococci. For menstrual irregularities and bodily weakness resulting from the disease, "Bu Nü Rong" can be taken to clear the leukorrhea and regulate menstruation, restoring fertility. This is truly an excellent method for women suffering from leukorrhea to secretly treat themselves at home.</p>
<h3 id="e209">The End of Smokers <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan</p>
<p>How to Avoid the Death Penalty in the Twenty-Sixth Year: Tobacco Poison Does Not Harm the Gonads But Affects the Entire Body</p>
<p>The twenty-sixth year is approaching. Smokers who continue their addiction will not be able to avoid the National Government's ban and will face the death penalty.</p>
<p>But it is truly heartbreaking to say that the reason smokers do not want to quit is that they lack reliable medications, leading to severe withdrawal symptoms. As a result, most quit halfway and relapse. Take the so-called "Wild Man Head" quit-smoking drugs, for example; their effects are limited to the gonads and cannot invigorate the hormones throughout the body that are destroyed by tobacco poison. Taking these gonad preparations is like putting a donkey's head on a horse's body. Ask any doctor (excluding slick pharmacists) – aren't smokers deficient in hormones?</p>
<p>I use "Bu Ti Kang," a hormone preparation invented by the great German physiologist Meren, for oral administration. It allows smokers to quit without any pain. After thousands of cases of experimentation, all smokers have been able to quit tobacco poison in a short time, and because of the increased hormones, they can quickly gain weight after quitting.</p>
<h3 id="e210">A Plea from a Young Man Suffering from Spermatorrhea <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Changgeng</p>
<p>… Pleads for Those Suffering from Sexual Neurasthenia Nationwide … Advises Young Fellow Sufferers to Choose Medication Carefully</p>
<p>To the Editor of Kang Jian Zhi Lu:</p>
<p>Now that I have been saved, I want to confess my past sins in detail as a way to cleanse my inner defilement. When I was seventeen, I was led astray by my neighbor, Mr. C, and became addicted to masturbation. At that time, I only cared about satisfying momentary pleasure and practiced it recklessly for over a year. As a result, I became thinner day by day.</p>
<p>It was spring, and my face often turned red and felt hot, my head was heavy, and my temples ached. I couldn't think, and my eyes blurred when I read. Every night, I would have erotic dreams, which led to spermatorrhea. Later, it occurred every one or two days. I couldn't even look at the opposite sex; otherwise, my heart would race, my mind would wander, my penis would erect, and semen would flow out.</p>
<p>The doctor said I couldn't get married because my sexual nerves were so weak and underdeveloped, and my genitals were as small as a finger. I mistakenly bought a certain spermatorrhea medicine, but to my surprise, it didn't stop the spermatorrhea, and it made my appetite worse and my lower abdomen uncomfortable. Fortunately, my uncle returned from studying medicine in London. He said that the spermatorrhea pills invented by the famous European venereal disease expert Nelles were very popular in Germany, England, and America. At first, I was skeptical, but after trying "Nelles Spermatorrhea Pills" for less than three bottles, the spermatorrhea stopped, my energy increased, and my appetite returned to normal. My uncle also said that I should take the hormone preparation "Bu Ti Kang" to promote development, because only hormones could have this effect, according to my uncle, Dr. Wu Shouxin. After taking "Bu Ti Kang" for about four weeks, I experienced significant development, my body grew half an inch taller, my facial muscles became smoother, and my brainpower also improved.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Causes of Bloating and Reduced Appetite <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Song Zhongyu, Graduate of the Army Medical University</p>
<p>… Early Symptoms of Stomach Problems … Treatment for Constipation and Abdominal Bloating</p>
<p>If there is a loss of appetite for no reason, or chest tightness and stomach stagnation due to excessive thinking or stomach problems, it indicates that the stomach function is already impaired, which is the initial stage of stomach disease. The pain of stomach disease is extremely diverse, such as belching and acid reflux, hiccups and bloating in the second stage, or even constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and intestinal rumbling. Excessive gas and discomfort are also common. In the final stage, there is frequent vomiting, stomach pain, and fainting, all of which are extremely dangerous. Based on my clinical experience, I have confirmed that the German medicine "Qiang Wei Jing" is the most effective. It has miraculous effects in treating stomach stagnation. According to the most famous stomach disease expert in Europe, Maxine, this medicine is an effective remedy for gastrointestinal disorders and can also be used as a tonic due to its rich nutrients.</p>
<p>Reader's Forum</p>
<p>The following medicines have all been prescribed by physicians who graduated from famous medical universities at home and abroad. When purchasing, be sure to identify the names of each medicine clearly. Do not be misled by others to purchase miscellaneous inferior products, which may harm your condition!</p>
<p>White Turbidity and Testicular Swelling</p>
<p>Editor: I have suffered from white turbidity for many years, sometimes better and sometimes worse, with white mucus appearing intermittently. This spring, my testicles swelled up, making it difficult to walk. I have consulted doctors and taken medicine, but to no avail. Please advise on a treatment method. (Lu Ruoming)</p>
<p>Answer: You can take "Kelinong," which is effective in treating gonorrhea-related conditions such as orchitis, prostatitis, and cystitis. It is important to take it promptly to recover. Or consult Dr. Yao Juyan for the latest X-ray and anti-gonococcal serum therapy.</p>
<p>Kidney Deficiency and Short Penis</p>
<p>I have suffered from erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation for nearly two years, and my relationship with my wife is like that of strangers. Semen dribbles during the day, and I experience spermatorrhea every other night, and I have not been able to conceive. My genitals are small, like a child's. I have taken various medicines on the market, but they have only made my lower body weaker, and I experience bloating and pain when urinating. Now, my friend Mr. Li Xianqian has introduced me to "Bu Ti Kang," saying that it has special effects and is non-stimulating. I have taken one bottle, and my erections are already stronger and my energy is good. Can it also promote development and be taken as a tonic regularly? (Fan Wenda)</p>
<p>Answer: "Bu Ti Kang" is a hormone preparation that can promote overall development and has a mild nature. It will promote development after taking it and can be used as a winter tonic. However, for spermatorrhea, it is advisable to also take the effective remedy "Nelles Spermatorrhea Pills," which can completely eliminate sperm leakage.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Mourning Mr. Lu Xun <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yinfei</p>
<p>"People should indeed live, but for the sake of evolution; it is okay to suffer, but for the sake of eliminating all future suffering; and even more so, one should fight, but for the sake of reform. … If one does not utter a word, nor fire a single arrow at the main force of darkness, and only babbles incessantly at the 'weak,' then even if he appears righteous, I cannot help but say… I really cannot bear it anymore… he is indeed an accomplice to murder." (Lu Xun: On the Affairs of Mrs. Qin Liqi)</p>
<p>From the May Fourth Movement to the present, Mr. Lu Xun has been fighting the "main force of darkness" at all times. The champions of the May Fourth era have either retired or joined the enemy's camp, while Mr. Lu Xun has not been eliminated by the times. For the sake of human "evolution," and for the sake of "eliminating all future suffering," he stands at the forefront of the times, bravely and steadfastly "fighting" the "main force of darkness," and although he is "suffering," he considers it acceptable.</p>
<p>Because he is always a warrior standing at the forefront of the times, old age is not only harmless to him but also beneficial. When other "old generals" cannot withstand the rapid current of the times and fall, or try to hold on to the times so that they can stand firm, Mr. Lu Xun learns richer experiences in the rapids. These experiences are lacking or even non-existent to other young warriors.</p>
<p>Therefore, this seasoned old warrior is even more worthy of our love and support. But who would have expected that this vanguard of the times would not be able to withstand his physiological weakness and leave his troubled country!</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun has been ill a lot in the past two years, but even in his illness, he seems to have never thought about his own body. On the contrary, he worked even harder. In a miscellany called "Death," he said:</p>
<p>"Since last year, every year after recovering from illness, while lying on a rattan chair, I cannot help but think about what I should do after my strength recovers: what articles to write, what books to translate or publish. After deciding, I conclude: That's it. — But I must hurry. This thought of 'must hurry' is something I didn't have before, because unconsciously, I remembered my age. But I have never directly thought about 'death.'"</p>
<p>Under such efforts, in the past two years, books such as "Dead Souls," "Lace Literature," and many essays scattered in various publications have appeared. And because of this, his body became weaker and weaker, and finally could not withstand the attack of illness and closed his eyes forever. If he could have thought a little more about his own body and rested well before his sick body had fully recovered, I think he wouldn't have died now, would he? However, in order to "eliminate all future suffering," he thought about many things to do before his strength had recovered, and "must hurry" to do them. In a way, this is self-hastening one's death, but who is it for after all?</p>
<p>In his will, he said: "Do not do anything about commemoration." And he said, "Forget me and take care of your own life. — If not? Then it's really foolish." Such a warrior has died, and it is really not easy for us to forget him lightly. And "do not do anything about commemoration," in form, we may be able to do it, but in our hearts, we often "commemorate" because it is not easy to forget. When "taking care of our own lives," when reading his posthumous works, we cannot help but "commemorate" him, because the biggest problem in China today, the problem shared by everyone, is the problem of national survival, and all aspects of life (including eating and sleeping) are related to this problem; for example, eating may not be related to love, but currently, the eating and love of Chinese people are somewhat related to the advantages and disadvantages of ××. This can be understood by looking at the situation in Manchuria and North China." (See Mr. Lu Xun's response to questions from visitors during his illness, "On Our Current Literary Movement.") Thus, even "do not do anything about commemoration" seems unlikely.</p>
<p>Naturally, Mr. Lu Xun's reason for saying this is very clear: because he does not want people to be foolish, he tells them to "take care of their own lives" and not to commemorate him. But here, we can see that to "take care of our own lives," one can only follow Mr. Lu Xun's path (although there are different ways to go). And on the long journey, it is impossible and unnecessary to forget the partners who have traveled the same road.</p>

<h3 id="e213">Universal Funeral Home: Paying Respects to Mr. Lu Xun's Remains <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>An unfortunate piece of news pierced the hearts of many young people of the era. The newspaper reported to us: "The giant of the Chinese literary world," "Mr. Lu Xun is dead"! Holding the newspaper and looking at the portrait of Mr. Lu Xun printed on it, we young people, who had only seen his works and never met him, could hardly suppress the tears that flowed naturally from the depths of our hearts. For every young person of the era and the vast masses of society, this is such an unfortunate piece of news that is worthy of immense grief!</p>
<p>The evening paper of the 19th reported that Mr. Lu Xun's remains would be moved to the Universal Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road tomorrow for people to pay their respects. For such a giant in the Chinese national battle formation, we could not usually see him. Only after his death could he, with his final appearance, freely meet with the young people and social groups who admired him. With twelve million devout hearts, I got up very early on the morning of the 20th and rushed to the Universal Funeral Home to reverently pay respects to the remains of our old warrior and world star of the literary world.</p>
<p>I arrived at Jiaozhou Road at 8:30 in the morning. Because it was still early, the entrance of the Universal Funeral Home was quiet, and not many people had arrived yet. Upon entering, there were many greeters on both sides. After signing my name, I reverently stepped onto the memorial steps of the hall. Inside, there were very few people. The hall was decorated with flowers, grass, and pine trees. A dozen large wreaths were piled next to Mr. Lu Xun's portrait. A square face and a thick beard—this was the portrait of Mr. Lu Xun that we often saw in publications. On both sides of the portrait, there were two vases of fresh flowers with paper strips hanging down, on which were written: "Eternal rest to Teacher Lu Xun" and "Respectfully offered by twelve young people." In addition, there were huge wreaths from Mr. Lu Xun's only close friend during his lifetime, the Japanese businessman Kanzo Uchiyama, as well as Major General Yoshi of the Japanese military, Shen Yanbing, and others. This morning, half of the staff of Uchiyama Bookstore had been invited here to be greeters. Uchiyama had a special friendship with Lu Xun. This great friendship filled us with a great sense of respect.</p>
<p>The stairs were carpeted with soft carpets. I walked upstairs silently, gently, and solemnly. Mr. Lu Xun's remains were placed in a room on the west side. The bed was placed diagonally, and a chestnut-colored silk quilt quietly covered his remains. He lay quietly, his face extraordinarily thin. He had been ill for a long time. His thick beard was arranged untidily on his upper lip, and short beards also surrounded the lower ends of his cheeks. His eyes were closed quietly. Although thin, we could still recognize his vibrant style from the photos. This was the only giant of our era who influenced the entire cultural advancement front of China for more than a decade since the May Fourth Movement! I respectfully bowed to his remains. Many fresh flowers and wreaths were placed around the bed. I stood there, bewildered, and a wave of sorrow bit at my heart. I almost burst into tears. With what kind of heart should we mourn Mr. Lu Xun, this cultural giant and the only teacher of young people?</p>
<p>Several people were taking pictures. I was flustered and slowly retreated from his room. I went back to see him again. This was the first time I had seen this great cultural leader, and it was also the last time I would see him. No matter what, I could not suppress my sad heart!</p>
<p>After leaving the hall, I stood on the steps for a moment. By this time, more and more people were arriving. There were one or two hundred female students from a certain school, coming in a class. When I left the Universal Funeral Home, I predicted that more young people would come from afar, holding a devout heart, to pay their respects to the remains of this only giant of the literary world.</p>
<p>From Mr. Lu Xun's death, I thought of Maxim Gorky, the world's greatest writer who had passed away not long ago. When Gorky died, the Soviet people who lined up for miles to pay respects to his remains in Red Square numbered in the hundreds of thousands. However, the death of our era's only warrior, Mr. Lu Xun, only involved a few writers. He could not, after his death, allow more people to have the opportunity to pay their respects to him and express their condolences. However, his death would touch the hearts of every progressive young person in China, just like the death of Gorky.</p>

<p>— Guo Ka</p>
<p>My mother went to the city to my sister's house, and my father also went out on business, leaving only me alone quietly reading in the house.</p>
<p>"Is Changgui home?"</p>
<p>Suddenly, the curtain opened, and a head covered with a broken reed hat peeked in and greeted me.</p>
<p>"Oh—" I raised my head blankly.</p>
<p>"A portion of rent grain."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>So I put aside my book and found a small account book to temporarily perform the duties of a landlord.</p>
<p>The small account book had familiar words written by my father. I found the name mentioned by the person, looked at the words below the name, and said:</p>
<p>"One dou seven sheng five he?"</p>
<p>"That's about right, but I've already eaten quite a bit!"</p>
<p>He said hesitantly. I ignored him and stepped out.</p>
<p>He followed me to the grain storage room, placed the measuring tools, and untied the rope of the grain bag, while stammering again:</p>
<p>"Changgui, the wheat harvest is bad this year, and I've already eaten quite a bit."</p>
<p>This man was short and spoke with his face tilted up. His face seemed to tell people how foolish and obedient he was.</p>
<p>I habitually said:</p>
<p>"That won't do."</p>
<p>He mumbled even more:</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I'll eat even less and less. I swept it all together and brought it here today. I didn't dare eat any more rice for breakfast, just cooked some sticky porridge to drink!"</p>
<p>Although I was outwardly reserved, I was a little moved in my heart. I knew in what kind of sin I was living. As a result, much was still owed. This act of mine also moved him, and his eyes showed two beams of emotion, as if grateful that his little master was so kind!</p>
<p>At this moment, another person also came in carrying a bag of grain. This one was young, strong, and tall, with a sharp nose, as if a sign of untamedness.</p>
<p>He argued loudly with me, saying that the harvest was bad this year and he couldn't possibly pay in full.</p>
<p>According to the numbers in the small account book, after measuring each dou, the two people followed me to my father's room, watching me record the account, and reminding me as usual:</p>
<p>"Changgui, is it recorded in the account?"</p>
<p>I nodded, sitting quietly. They both took out their pipes to smoke. After smoking, the younger one put his pipe in the tobacco pouch and said to his companion:</p>
<p>"Let's go!"</p>
<p>"You go first, I'll stay for a while."</p>
<p>The younger one glanced at him and lifted the grain bag, leaving on his own.</p>
<p>The behavior of the one who remained intrigued me. I watched him quietly. He finally looked at me clumsily and said with an unnatural smile on the corner of his mouth:</p>
<p>"Changgui, do you have any cold pancakes (a type of food made with millet)? Give me a couple to eat. I only drank some thin porridge this morning, which wasn't filling enough, and I walked twenty li, so I'm terribly hungry!"</p>
<p>This sudden attack caught me a little off guard. I believe my expression was also unnatural. I quickly turned my head and said to a maidservant washing clothes in the yard:</p>
<p>"Are there any pancakes left? Give a few to this rent payer."</p>
<p>This maidservant was trained, she knew how to save things in front of the master. She made it up without thinking:</p>
<p>"That's terrible! Where are the pancakes? There weren't even enough to feed the dogs this morning."</p>
<p>I almost pleaded and commanded a few sentences before the person who had only drunk thin porridge in the morning received a few cold pancakes.</p>
<p>Looking at his satisfied gaze and tattered figure, I was deeply touched. I knew in what kind of sin I was raised!</p>

<p>Zhongxi (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening Chapter "Shen Fengxi"</p>
<p>Withered spring breeze and rain-soaked hair,</p>
<p>Who recognizes the former Han E adrift?</p>
<p>Selling art on Tianqiao to barely make a living,</p>
<p>Alas, her final years are filled with hardship.</p>
<p>The strings and drums sadly tell of her life,</p>
<p>A song of sorrow in autumn breaks the heart.</p>
<p>By chance, she meets the young Master Fan, a connoisseur,</p>
<p>Their love is deep and cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Who knows that good things are always envied,</p>
<p>Endless sadness and evil storms arise.</p>
<p>Don't blame the poor, rogue third uncle,</p>
<p>Just blame the two words of vanity that bewitched him.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, gold can buy smiles,</p>
<p>But a beauty's heart is most difficult to grasp.</p>
<p>Laughable, she sings a song of separation,</p>
<p>Tears fill her eyes with ten bushels of sorrow.</p>
<p>Who knows that a person waits deep in the doorway like the sea,</p>
<p>The general's power is indeed towering.</p>
<p>But see, jewelry and jade are dazzling, her heart is first drunk,</p>
<p>And she abandons her past affections into the blue sands.</p>
<p>How can she care for the oath and contract made in fragrant silk?</p>
<p>Alas, a foolish heart has no cure,</p>
<p>Alas, her fate is twisted, turning her into a moth in the orchids.</p>
<p>She is left with a desolate fan broken in the autumn wind,</p>
<p>Calling out in grief on her sickbed, what can be done?</p>
<p>Suddenly crying, suddenly laughing,</p>
<p>New sorrows and old dreams blur together.</p>
<p>Unforgettable is the handsome young man from the filthy world of Qiantang,</p>
<p>Unforgettable is the white-haired mother with tears like shuttles.</p>
<p>Ragged willows are not to be seen, how can she,</p>
<p>Fill the Tianqiao's White Cloud Nunnery like a river?</p>
<p>Vast karmic sea of boundless hatred,</p>
<p>Thousands of ancient beauties have thin lives.</p>
<p>The lingering sound is entrusted to the Nanke dream.</p>

<p>He has three points of the world in his mind.</p>
<p>Since the first battle at Bowang,</p>
<p>He wanted to break Cao's army with fire.</p>
<p>First, issue the order, Zhao Zilong,</p>
<p>Three drums beat to stir up heroes.</p>
<p>There is also Zhang Yide,</p>
<p>Saying that he is trapped in Longzhong.</p>
<p>Hating that his elder brother believed Xu Wu Zhi,</p>
<p>He hired a farmer from Wolonggang three times.</p>
<p>Zhang Fei was frightened, relying on your fast horse and sharp spear,</p>
<p>You could not capture Cao Thief successfully.</p>
<p>Xiahou Dun forced Anlin Road,</p>
<p>Wounding his one eye is difficult to repay.</p>
<p>The teacher had already decided in his mind,</p>
<p>Xiahou Dun's life was not over.</p>
<p>From then on, Zhang Fei admired him,</p>
<p>See how he will repay his good deeds.</p>
<p>What face does he have to plead guilty with a thorn on his back?</p>

<p>And has a confidante, Qiao Meixiang.</p>
<p>Strange scenes of prosperity can be enjoyed,</p>
<p>Hating that her husband is too frivolous.</p>
<p>Sending palace flowers awakens the Yangguan dream,</p>
<p>Laughter suddenly sends Chu Xiang Wang.</p>
<p>But hating the vulgarity of the spring breeze and the flowers,</p>

<p>The old nun skillfully plays her eloquent tongue,</p>
<p>Saying that it is because of love that the Ti Ba Yin Xi is hurt.</p>
<p>This month is a good day for a banquet,</p>
<p>The golden goblet is filled with Zixia wine.</p>
<p>Listening to the whispers of people outside,</p>

Arouse dreams of reunion. The alarm clock announces the time mechanically. No need for you to shout blindly. The two plump chickens are not thin. Their bodies are full of strong meat and fat. The old lady is thirty-three weeks old. Tomorrow, guests will come to celebrate her birthday. Hoping you grow fatter and fatter. The guests will have to slaughter you. Scatter two or three ladles of crushed sugar. Satisfy them as much as possible. The hen listened and cried bitterly. Cried bitterly. Raising chickens to lay eggs for delicacies. Originally it was repaying kindness with evil. Only knowing that the fatter the better. Who knows that life is hard to escape. Beheaded, bled, and plucked. Skin and meat are fried. Sister-in-law raises chickens for birthday celebrations. The two chickens were afraid of death and slipped away. You should invite me to be your advisor. Don't talk nonsense.

<h3 id="e220">Jin Cheng Screens "Little Lingzi" Today <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>The style of national films mostly tends towards seriousness and composure, with few light and cheerful works. If there are any, "Little Lingzi" is the first. This film creates a unique style in Chinese cinema, breaking away from old tunes. It consistently adopts a lighthearted style, which has never been seen before. The director skills of Cheng Bugao, the screenwriting experience of Ouyang Yuqian, coupled with the deified expressions of Tan Ying and Zhao Dan, result in satisfactory achievements. The play depicts the story of a country girl who admires vanity, eventually being played by others. Pain is revealed in the lightness, and a bitter smile is contained in the humor. It is indeed a thought-provoking work. In addition to Tan Ying and Zhao Dan, the film also features Wang Xianqi, Pang Jianong, and Mei Xi as male actors, and Lu Luming, Shu Xiuwen, Ying Yin, and Green Leaf Peony as female actors. They complement each other well. It is produced by Star Film Company, and movie fans should be the first to see it.</p>

<h3 id="e222">"Blood Flower" to Be Released in Shanghai Soon <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Originally titled "Three Girl Friends"</p>
<p>Regarding works composed using three characters, besides the Soviet film "Three Friends" which will be released soon, Dumas and Kipling have also written similar works in the past. This "Three Girl Friends" is also written using such a structure, but its protagonist is changed to female.</p>
<p>This film was well-received when it premiered in the United States, and was praised as the most emotional and stimulating of all Soviet films. It is the most emotional because the film is different from general Soviet films, as it depicts private life; it is the most stimulating because it uses the feelings of two people to express the emotions of the masses, and it never leaves the background of the masses.</p>
<p>It tells the story of three poor girls who made a living by singing when they were young. The process of their growing up coincided with major events such as the European War, the Revolution, and the Civil War. They participated in the Civil War, and one of the three inseparable girlfriends finally died tragically - using a tragedy to match the heroic ending, this film is even more powerful. It is now translated as "Blood Flower" and will be released soon at the Shanghai Grand Theater.</p>
