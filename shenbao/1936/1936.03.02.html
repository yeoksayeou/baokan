<p>— 星</p>
<p>美國史家費氏S．Fay．曾謂第一决世界大戰之發生厥因凡五卽經濟的帝國主義武力主義民族主義報紙之鼓吹戰爭及秘密之集團外交是五者之中允以集團外交爲大戰之基本原因吾人觀歐洲之現狀凡一九一四年以前存在之戰爭原因無一不具備又無一不變本而加厲而更使人觸目驚心者戰前之三國同盟與三國恊商爭霸歐洲互相傾軋之情形竟於今日重行出現據近日歐洲方面消息法蘇恊定及英法等制裁派國家之合作已引起意德波蘭奧匈五國集團之活動使此種集團見於事實則一九一四年之禍患爲期不遠歷史之重演非人力所可支配也</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰之前中歐集團爲德奧意三國今日醞釀中之五國集團則奧匈二國爲舊奧帝國之一部波蘭之一部份領土得自德國故五國集團在區域上言與大戰前之三國集團幾無區別三國集團其目標在於俄法其領導權在於柏林今之五國集團其情形亦復相同戰前之三國協商始於俄法之二國同盟繼以英法之友好協商更繼而爲英俄之親善今英法二國因地中海問題已有互助之恊定法蘇協定日內卽可批准生效而英俄二國亦有妥恊之可能求之史跡如出一轍所不同者戰前之三國集團乃戰勝國之結合奧匈帝國爲統治他族之國家德國爲亞爾薩斯勞蘭之征服者今之五國集團德奧匈皆爲戰敗之國家其恢復失地之要求曾不减於戰前之法國而意大利爲不滿足之國家波蘭雖爲凡爾賽條的之寵兒然其領土之慾未窮於捷克及立陶宛等處均有覬覦之意故五國集團之富於侵略性方之戰前之三國集團且遠有過之</p>
<p>此歐洲二大壁壘之形成必使國際聯盟之合作精神和平理想黯然無色固不待言者而五强集團共目的在打破現狀推翻國際聯盟庇護中之歐洲現勢允昭然若揭意大利德意志之要求海外殖民地之重分配及歐洲國境之重劃定也奧大利匈牙利之要求舊日疆域之收回及經濟障碍之掃除也波蘭不滿於現狀其膨脹力將侵入波羅的海諸國與捷克之疆域以內果五國之談判成功則歐洲二大集團相猜相忌相仇相恨因恐懼與敵視必使軍備競爭積極化戰爭之空氣日趨濃厚一旦對立之均勢稍有動搖或武力準備達相當程度必使一九一四之慘劇重演於萊茵多瑙二河之間也</p>

<p>— 邵士平</p>
<p>四川的土地關係與捐稅（續）</p>
<p>然而惡劣的情形還多呢。在萬縣等處田地出租，訂有片面的契的，農民一做佃戶，就有種種契的束縛，並且被索鉅額押金，每租十石，需押金百元以上。如同時幾家爭佃一地，那末押金可以無限增加。倘使租穀稍有拖欠，地主可以立刻解的，另招承佃，而佃戶就得吃官司，坐牢，敲打虐殺也並不希奇。而瀘江·江安等處租榖時常任意提高，二年之內，已增三分之一。佃農生活自然只有日趨苦海。</p>
<p>田賦與稅捐</p>
<p>四川田賦的高度和捐稅的繁重是世界有名的，因爲四十多萬軍隊的給養，和政費的開支，當然只有取之於民。現在我們舉個統計來看看吧。</p>
<p>四川每畝農田負担（見汗血四卷四號）二十二年調査彰明　八·二〇〇　二〇五〇廣漢　三·七五〇　八九三渠縣　四·〇〇〇　一〇〇〇成都　二·五六〇　六四〇綿陽　二·〇三〇　五〇八彭縣　一·七五〇　四三八內江　一·五八五　三七五雅安　一·二七四　三一九灌縣　一·〇八五　二七一</p>
<p>每畝田賦負担最輕的（灌縣）也要一元多，最重的（彰明）竟達八元以上。普通也在一元五角至四元左右，以四川每畝田地的生產率比較，的確重得可以了。卽如江南水田區域，每畝田賦很少超出二元以上，然而已經够高了；何况竟達八元以上呢！並且田賦還有增加趨勢，農民負祖逐年加大，這又是不可掩飾的事實。</p>
<p>四川歷年田賦之變遷與佔地價的％</p>
<p>（中央農業實騐所調査）</p>
<p>上表吿訴我們，田賦增加得如何的快呀！從民元至民二十二年，在這二十二之間，不論水田旱田，都增加一倍左右，而近年來還在繼續向上。</p>
<p>然而我們不說明田賦的預征，還不得了解農民的苦痛。預征田賦是四川軍政當局的拿手戲。在民國二十一年初，成都　預征二十八年，崇寗預征三十八年，　縣四十一年，廣安十二年，蓬安二十四年，其他各地或多或少，都有同樣情形。在目前許多地方已征至八，九十年，其决六，七十年，並且各縣每年多至十餘征，少亦四，五征，農民以全部生產物抵納田賦，往往還有不足之虞</p>
<p>然而這樣的田賦對於大地主又怎樣呢？我們知道他們是受不到多大影響的。第一大地主跟政治根本分拆不開，他是各地政治上的重要角色。第二，卽使退一步講，也因爲軍政當局靠着槍桿子要想征收田賦，不經他們的手也毫無辦法，因此也正是他們漁利的好機會。第川，大地主往往不住鄉村。或在外縣，更因防區關係，沒奈何他。當局就實行「跟地尋糧」的辦法，誰種田誰就得納稅。頂倒霉的還是佃農。自然，不和政治結緣的小地主和沒有辦法股離本地的中農，貧農，也只有儘它敲剝。近年來，孱弱無力的地主的沒落，和參加政治活動的新地主的興起，其原因也就在這裏</p>
<p>前年，蔣委員長入川之後，對於川政改進，不遺餘力。於是由劉湘通電全川，田賦自本年（廿四年）三月一日起，規定每年一征，但在剿匪軍事未結束，軍隊整理未就緒以前，得比照賦額附征臨時軍費三倍。這無異說一年要征四年的田賦，但不能作爲預征。這自然比之一年十餘征要好得多了。</p>
<p>但是實行新政之後，各地的情形又怎樣呢？我們不妨拿事實來說：</p>
<p>據大公報去年四月十四日的記載「四川各軍在靑黃不接之際，仍舊乘機盡剝削之能事。新津縣馬上勒征糧稅。卬崍也開征新糧，並附加學欵每兩七角五分，限五月底掃淸。岳池勒征九十萬元，限四月底繳淸，然而糧票竟倒塡月日，以致縣民逃到重慶控吿楊森。又據同報三月十三日記載，廿八軍藉名軍餉急迫，飭令灌縣政府於三月八日（卽新政公布後八日）開征糧稅兩年。川北的情形更是可憐。我們且讀川北民衆張爛等上蔣委員長的呈文：（見去年三月二十六日大公報）一二十軍長楊森，曾於二十三年二月在南充籌殺一萬二千石名供軍食，實行轉賣，致使中人之家，儲蓄悉罄。近日該軍旅長楊漢城，復派南充出榖二千石，限期繳納，不知作何用途。該軍長刻又令飭南充從三月一日起（卽新政改革之日——作者，）征糧一决，每兩需納五十七元餘。查南充正糧的九千五百餘兩，舊例每糧一兩，一年祗應征七元零九仙三星，合計不過六萬七千餘元。今次征糧五十七元，則是一决征八年之糧，合計在五十三萬元以上，復限一月繳淸，令人震駭……」川北情形，大致同此。川南也是一樣，試舉古藺爲例。古藺原本是一個地瘠民貧的僻壤，受盡軍閥貪官的壓迫，民衆早已衣食不全。這决「共匪」竄入之後，跟着大軍人縣，征發糧秣，刦掠財物，弄得「十室十空」。不料「共匪」方退，縣府馬上佈吿征收田賦四年，鴉片烟稅（烟苗罰金）八萬元。民衆再也不能負担了。於是特電省府。要求「令飭制止」，否則，「卽請派兵到藺，將我闔縣三十萬民衆，一齊屠殺，反較痛快。」再不能忍受鷄零狗碎一塊一塊的剜割了。總而言之，正如川西南旅省（成都）同鄉會向蔣委員長申訴所說，「自從實行統一稅之後，各戍軍防區駐兵，仍不明大義，趁此過度時期，勾結團首，加緊壓榨吾民，强取一切苛雜，吾民痛苦，較前益劇。」這是一點不錯的。但「過度時期」會延長到什麽時候呢？</p>
<p>並且田賦的催征又非常嚴厲，征收委員之多更如過江之鯽，需索騷擾，不勝其苦。譬如資中縣的糧稅，現已征至民國六十年，歷年積欠的糧尾也有二萬多元，縣政府召集各鄉團總商量的結果，决交糧隊加息征收，由團總督促繳解分三期繳淸，每期二十天，每糧票一張要加「口食」二角，收糧一元，第一期加息一角，第二期加一角半，第三期加到二角，倘使在這六十天內不繳淸，就要「法辦」。這種情形不惟資中，不但催繳糧尾爲然，各縣糧稅征收也完全同樣。</p>
<p>其他各種雜稅，又是五花八門，名目繁多，例如門戶團練之購槍費啦！團槍費啦！團槍彈費啦！修堰費啦！懶捐（不種雅片）啦！各色各種，各縣名目不同，統計全省的在二千多種以上，打破各省之紀錄，怪不得要有「吾川苦苛雜者久矣，官吏則敲剝吸髓。慾壑難塡，人民則忍痛負祖，汗乾血盡。曩昔本稱天府，而今竟成鬼窟」的呼聲了。（完）</p>

<p>總分局四所記機七千三百號</p>
<p>南京通訊、自動電話在南京、開始於十九年七月、適當建都之後、機關林立、商業鼎盛、以致用戶驟增、那時總局方面、裝置三千號、鼓樓分局一千號、下關分局一千號、二共是五千號、至民二十三年、便吿額滿、决年、呈准交通部、就城南舊江寗縣署設立南分局、增加一千八百號、北分局（鼓樓）同時擴充五百號、共為七千三百號、原定去冬卽可通話、中間因自動公司交貨延誤、直至上月間、南北分局之新機方吿裝竣、開始通話、據該局負責人云、對於新裝用戶、暫時已可應付了、此外該局又在束山鎮（江寗縣政府新址）設立分局、裝置五十門磁石式小交換總機、業已開始動工、不久亦可完成、</p>
<p>長途電話方面、凡屬部辦之京滬·京蕪·滬杭·蚌埠·及江北一帶、早已接通外、他如江蘇省辦之江寗·句容·溧水·溧陽·鎮江·丹陽·武進·余壇·宜興·等九縣長途電話、以及浙江省辦之長途電話、均可接通、又部辦之平·津·湘·鄂·魯·贛·等省長途電話、不久也可通話了、至於江蘇全省除上述九縣外、其他各縣、大部份已架設長途電話、因係省建設廳所主辦、與部辦者、顯有抵觸、在同一系統之下、形成一種對立的形勢、無論就事業本身或就組織系統而言、都是極不經濟、而且極不合理、似有調整之必要、</p>
<p>者都電話機械室、設在該局三樓、一共分六部份、卽第一第二綫鍵、第一至第三選擇器、和終接器、第一綫鍵以五十號為一組、在此五十號中間、同時只能接通十號、第二錢鍵以六十號為一組、同時可以接通十號、當我們撥動號盤時、時常會聽得嗡嗡的蟬鳴聲、（忙聲）便知已經有人在佔綫了、第一選擇器、縱橫各為十格、依照我們撥動的號數跳動、譬如我們撥動四字、這時便縱跳至第四格、然後再橫跳至空錢、接通第二和第三選擇器、如果橫跳在第八格、這時便表示前面七條綫、已經被佔用了、在每一個選擇器、只管理一個號碼、最後到終接器、專管最後兩個號碼、通常我們呌通一决電話、從第一綫鍵起、至終接器北、必須經過這六部份、靠了機器的動作、不須人力、能夠自動接通、眞是一伴非常巧妙的事情呢、</p>
<p>電話號碼的第一個數字、乃是代表區域的、二字頭屬於市中心區、為總局所在地、城北鼓樓一帶為三字、下關為四字、南分局成立後、城南中華門一帶、一律改用五字了、</p>
<p>常我們使用電話的時候、常常因了錢路被佔、而發生障碍、幾乎成了普遍的現象、這是很不應該的、擄該局負責人云、依照規定、在同一時間內、不能接通的電話、至多只能佔百分之二十、但是該局却已超過百分之七十了、換句話說在一百架電話中問、至多只能接通三十號、這樣、對於電話本身所負的使命、不能不說是一大缺陷了、</p>
<p>查該局創始於遜淸光緒二十六年、為兩江總督所辦、當時係磁石式、僅十六號、均為重要機關佔用、至光緒三十年、改歸督練公所辦理、始開放商戶、但用戶亦祇六十餘家、宣統三年、改屬財政公所、用戶也不過一百家左右、民國二年、改由德商西門子洋行接辦、民三、交通部接收辦理、仍用磁石式、民九、交部决定改用共電式、購置美國西方電器公司第一號A式交換機、同時設立下關浦口兩分局、城局裝設容量二千號、下關裝設容量八百號之共電式交換機、浦口又裝設一百號之磁石式交換機、安放過江水錢、至民十一年完成、這時用戶已增至六百餘家、民十四、開辦浦鎮分局、决年、又接通滬寗長途電話、至民十九年上半年、城內已裝滿二千號、下關五百號、浦口七十餘號、浦鎮三十餘號、至是年七月、便換裝世界通行之自動電話、民二十三年、浦鎮分局取消、决年、又取銷浦口分局、均併入下關分局、以上便是該局過去大略的情形、當三十六年前、該局草創的時期、僅有電話十六架、經過不斷的改進、到現在已增至七千三百號、依照最近的趨勢、還是供不應求、不久仍須擴充、前途未可限量、該局收支方面、每月可收月租費四萬三千餘元、押機費五千餘元、兩共四萬八千餘元、經常支出、計員工薪的一萬三千餘元、維持費用暨辦公消耗等費的一萬元、兩共二萬三千餘元、改自動機後、該項價欵計美金七十三萬餘元、新建南局之自動機價欵美金十四萬二千餘元、統計擴充綫路、更換新機、購置地基、建築局舍等的二百六十餘萬元、自交部採用統收統支辦法以後、該局收入、每月均掃數繳部、經常支出及撥還機價等費、也由交部撥付、</p>

<h3 id="c140">八千球迷喜出望外　東華再獲史高托杯　葡萄牙竟以一些三慘敗　柯拉沙昨因傷未會出席 <a href="#c140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>東華昨日在出人意料之外、以佳美之表演、擊敗强勁之葡萄牙、奪得史高托杯、繼續保持一年、結果三與一之比、逸園八千觀衆、喜出望外、歡呼如在、東華整勢、盛極一時、葡軍中鋒柯拉少、因傷未會出席、使匍軍減色不少、上半時東華連中二球、先佔優熱、劇戰情形如下、</p>
<p>十分鐘鐘內　雙喜臨門</p>
<p>兩時方過、亞爾培路已人如潮湧、逸園東西兩看臺人爲之滿、綜計的八千餘人、情况白熱、交頭接耳者、莫不討論兩隊實力之究竟如何、迨兩軍登場、葡隊長柯拉沙果因足傷未出席、使關懷之觀衆爲之一舒、惟依東華昨日之銳氣、即柯氏登場、亦穩可探囊取物、請於戰情中證之、交綏後、葡軍先取、一剎那即被截回、東華數次進展亦被阻、相持五六分鐘、東華大軍從中路發展、孫錦順單騎直入、閃過敵衛、一脚橫掃、低斜且急、葡門馬克士瞠目不知所措、東華以一對〇佔先、中綫開球、葡右翼小考斯坦沿邊直襲李寗迎之以腹、迫成角球、此時險狀環生、東華倘非及早預防想已遭殃、球入右路、東華五鋒、如風捲葉、一掃而至至、周光中、一脚送中、戴麟經夾攻、孫錦順略一撥動、球又袁入網窩、二對零距開賽僅十一分鐘也、</p>
<p>皮攻彼守互呈驚險　　東華銳氣正盛、幾度盤旋、葡門屢呈險象、幼良一脚左候在門側、惜從路下漏過、麟經拉弓猛射、被馬克斯撲地救出、連失兩决佳機、使觀衆爲之扼腕之至、葡軍多决反攻、亦未得逞、惟東華鬥下、亦數呈險象、小考斯坦直至底綫、一脚勾中、尚勷追之不及、幸李寗頭頂出險、球轉至中綫、又成混戰局面、李義臣福至心靈、斜裏送出、一度盤旋後、小考斯坦雄心未死、又圖進展、終被義臣截住、秋亭攻門未得機、小考斯坦死灰復燃、一脚高球、恰到好處、幸陸大哥接僩正着、未會闖禍、葡軍又從中路進兵、鍾恩見勢不佳、奔出營救、踢出未遠、此時腹地空虛、敵騎又雜踏、幸尚勸從後竄出、送成角球、小考斯坦主踢、方擬逞勇、而上半場之時間已至、東華以二對〇佔極對優先、</p>
<p>繼續保持史高托杯之東華隊</p>
<p>數度良機　惜未得手</p>
<p>會得手、顧尚勁在三十碼處一脚高射，惜差此一許、此時戰情沉悶已極、東華屢得良機、均成畫餅、孫錦順進達門下、被阻、撥送後方、運佑趕上一脚、竟被馬克斯揮拳拍出、一轉瞬間錦順叉單騎闖入、至底綫勿中、戴麟經一脚踢去、叉中門彈回、不僅此也、幸東華銳氣正盛、葡軍雖猛烈圍攻、終被李寗送成角球、李義臣客串後衛亦奇一佳、屹如泰出、中左兩路、休越雷池一步、</p>
<p>一喜一憂成三對一</p>
<p>葡軍角球未逞、尙動送至前線、小三子捷如閃電、惜斟掠野越、此時東華又呈險擾、義臣得球後送、鍾恩不及趕上、葡軍已鋒擁而至、李寗一脚踢去、又出險境、東華三度攻門均未成功、最可惜者、當幼良遞與金海時、錦順趕上一脚、低而且急、惜被馬克斯撲地救出、略一盤旋、東華幸運又至、當秋亭擲人界球、葡衛阻之、秋亭奔上送中、金海攻門被接、球出未遠、錦順底綫勾轉、金海趕上、幼良趁勢一脚、斜入網裏、三對〇使觀衆爲之在喜、中錢開球、葡軍咬牙切齒、一擁猛襲、長脚鹿一個不留神、不知不覺、竟被大羅柴遼射入網內、三對一東華仍然佔先、</p>
<p>奠定乾坤　葡軍屈服</p>
<p>東華旣一城、詎終塲亦僅九分鐘、東華兩度反攻未成、葡軍左路又活躍、義臣出犯手球、地位極險、幸大考斯坦開成野球、幼良一馬當先、左傳錦順、一度混戰、一戴麟經衆人叢中一脚、馬克斯趕忙撲去、已擦柱內、但裁判員未曾顧及、不作紀綠、比賽仍繼續進行、錦順攻門又被接、秋亭方在底綫活躍、而終場之笛聲已鳴、東華遂以三對一淘汰葡軍、除蟬聯兩屆史考托盃外、並湔雪前在聯賽中以五對三敗於葡軍之恥辱、賽後由西聯會長葛林曉氏致詞、並授盃與東華隊長馮運佑接受、再行保持史盃一年、兩軍陣容如下、</p>

<p>西聯足球會甲組聯賽、優游對蘭開夏、昨日下午三時在延平路申圜球塲舉行、優游自出師以來、逢戰必捷、已造成　戰四勝局面、蘭開夏則係瓜代英尼斯者、實力雖稱强勁、然觀其與西商之戰、以三對五吿敗、故球藝未如理想中之堅强、故優游操勝、殊有相當把握、上半時優游全軍合力進攻、在岌岌可危之局勢下、僅於終了時間兩分內、由鍾育祥攻入一球、下半時蘭開夏反攻甚烈、優游鍾育祥又受傷出塲、以十人應戰、幸球運亨規、蘭開夏幾度射門、均化險爲夷、優游否極泰來、反以二對一再度佔優、總結果三對一蘭開夏告挫，</p>

<p>— 予夐</p>
<p>最近財政都實行掉換公債政策。這種策，為去年幣制改革的　義之一，非憑公而來，在意義上無可非議。這决換債的主要點，在將各種公債完全統一。月於統十全部公債之外，又增發復與公債三萬四千萬兀。故公債數額，由十萬六千萬元突進而爲十八萬萬元。今後公債市塲中的特點，即公債完全相同，惟賞遺期限稍有差別而已。公債旣歸統一，担保與及利息相等，則投機操縱，多空爭雄，已較前此爲困難，故可望投機風氣不如前此之盛。惟因公債完全統一之故，市價的漲落，殆將完全一致。故今後的公債市價的起落，將見波浪壯闊。蓋在過去，公債償淸期限長短不等，利息略有參差，担保各不相同，故市價此起彼落，縱有風浪，不至全部致。現在公債旣經統　，市價漲落，完全相同，一漲一跌，有非尋常力量所能制止。現在公債數額，已達十八萬萬，事實上爲社會最大的投資。公債市價如不能保持安定，則余融市塲，將長在風雨飄搖之中。是以如何穩定公債市價，爲當前最值得考慮的問題。</p>
<p>復興公債二萬千萬兀的一部分，據財部所定，就在撥充平衡儘市基金，是維持債市的重要，早在當局的計畫之中。吾人以爲當局或將組平衡債市委員會，以司其事，至如何穩定債市，其辦法必出於常公債跌價時，購入公債，使公債市塲流通數量减少，歸於穗定。當公債市價飛漲，投機過盛時，售出公債，使市價不至過高。這種機械的動作，事實上就是各國所謂的公開市塲活勳。倘能逐漸養成這種機能，如不但公債市價可以較爲安定，即市塲籌　資余的榮枯，亦可藉是調劑。惟是在我國目前，却不無可以研究的地方。</p>
<p>假使由銀行購入公債，其另一方面即爲發行增加，這是必然。惟我國公債市價的變動，所受時局變化的影響，較經濟變化的影響爲大。可以說，公債發生在漲狂跌，必在國內外政治局面發生劇列　變動的時候。設公債　起大跌</p>
<p>如由銀行出而全力穩定債市，以現在債額旣達十八萬萬之鉅，非大量購人，不足維持，而反面爲銀行發鈔於短時間內突然膨脹，不但足以加重人心的恐慌，且使債市的安　更感困難，並恐外滙率也將發生危機。蓋時局變動，公債落價的時候，也即是資金最要擇路而逃的時候。在這倘關頭，郤好銀行增加發行，承受公債，則一般人暫將直接了當以公債售與銀行，取得紙幣，一轉身又購成外滙，如是則外滙也將發生　動的危機。至少銀行的外滙準備損失一部分，適以削弱。穩定外滙的力量。結果是即使救得公債，敎不得滙率。這種淸形，特別在團際局面隨時有惡化可能，更應特別顧到這一點。倘沒有切實補救的辦法，即敎濟公債，結果在銀行無異是一種冒險。並且，在危機發生的關頭，假如沒有保障的辦法，在銀行爲自保安全計，亦不敢積極作穩事債市的活動，活動愈積極，則游移的資金愈多，購買外滙者愈衆，外滙準備，俞見减少，這種趨向，實較之公債跌價允爲危險。所以在緊要關頭，只好一出全力穩定外滙爲要着。</p>
<p>如何補救這種弱點？這使是問題的中心。吾人以為惟一的辦法，只有積極進備亽必要時堵塞資金逃走的道路。杜絕資金逃走的道路，當然要涉及外匯問題。</p>
<p>自幣制改革后，中交等三行員無珢制供給外滙的責任。即不問其人購買外匯的動機何在，中交等三行員均負有供給的義務，即是外滙的購買，是完全自由的，不受限制。這樣中交三行員無限制供給外匯的責任，社會對於外滙，却有無限制購買的自由，以中交二行力量有一限的外滙，供給全國中外人十無限制的外滙需一要，這局面的不易維持，是很顯然的。所以吾人認爲目前應積極的准備統制外滙，至少外滙的購買應加以嚴格的限制。吾人可以確定的說，保持穩定，因為這樣才可以無願忌的在公債市場中作積極的活動。</p>

<p>— 蔣裕聲</p>
<p>一九三四年六月美國通過購銀法，白銀成爲世界經濟的政治的鬥爭武器，世界銀市踏入新的階段，銀價與銀貨流動量發生重大變化，中國貨幣跟着遭過了空前的厄運，被迫改革幣制。則一九二五年十二月，美國變更購銀程序，銀價劇跌，銀市轉入第二階段，中國的銀貨流動與貨幣制度隨卽也發生新的國際關係。現在世界銀潮已吿一段落，中國的貨幣將處於何種地位呢？這是必須從實際的銀市研究來答復的。</p>
<p>（一）銀價變遷</p>
<p>一九三四年六月以後，倫敦銀價完全受美國的控制，閃爲美國的積極驟銀，加以倫敦投機商的操縱，銀價扶搖直上，從六月的每盎斯合二十便士，漲到一九三五年四月的三十六便士，美國此時已成爲唯一的買主，鑒於倫敦操縱過甚，突然在規時期內退出銀市，致銀償迅速下跌，一時使投機商無法立足，直至八月二十六日，美國才重新把銀價維持在二十九便士，從八月到十二月七日，倫敦銀價很少變動，但與中國當時的對外匯率合算平價，依舊高出百分之六十七至百分之二十七，所以中國白銀外流，一直沒有停止，而國際的投機商，依舊有活躍的機會。</p>
<p>除了上述倫敦的銀價以外，紐的和孟買每天也有銀價公布，在一九三五年十二月以前，兩處銀價和倫敦保持平行的比例。紐約銀價在開始購銀以前，每盎斯合四角五分，相常于倫敦的二十便士，最高價是四月的八角一分，相當于倫敦的三十六便士，八月以後穩定在六角五分，相當于倫教的二十九便士，去年十二月九日以後，紐的放爲實際的買賣市場，才和倫敦脫離銀價的連鎖。</p>
<p>此次前後十八個月的銀潮當中，銀價起伏的差額是十五年來的最高紀錄，銀價提高的租度雖遠不及一九一〇年的八十九便士，但其由銀價波動所引起的世界影響，及其運用銀本位國爲投機的工具這一點，是十五年前不能夢想得到的境地。</p>
<p>（二）銀貨流動</p>
<p>一九三四年六月以後，白銀的最大買主－幾乎是唯一的買主是美國，白銀的主要供給在東方，而白銀的成交與集中則一直在倫敦，所以我們要研究這時期內的世界銀貨流動，祗須看倫敦的統計，便可一窺全豹。</p>
<p>這時期裏銀貨流動量的龐大是空前的，一九三四年以前，最多是一九二年倫敦的輸出入總額爲一九〇百萬盎斯，而一九三四年美國購銀法實施才半年，總額　增加到二八二百萬盎斯，一九三五年更增加到六八五百萬盎斯。一下面一個統計表可以指示一九三五年銀貨流動的方面：</p>
<p>一九三五年倫敦現銀流動表</p>
<p>（單位一〇〇盎斯）</p>
<p>轉錄Ｍesrs　Mocatta　　　Goldsmid　　AnnuaCircntar.　表中輸出入總額與前述六八五百萬盎斯略有短少</p>
<p>這裏值得注意的，美國是一九三五年最大的白銀買主，日本和香港是最大的供給國，查日本每年的銀產量僅僅七百萬盎斯，而他的出口量超過產量十倍以上，香港是一個轉口的商埠，更談不到銀產。他們的巨量白銀是從那裏來的呢？所以我們要研究中國在恐慌時期中現銀外流的眞相，必須以倫敦的現銀流動統針作參考。</p>
<p>中國在這種環境裏，存銀迅速减少，根據上海方面的統計，一九三四年六月底上海存銀爲五八二萬元，到幣制改革前减爲三三四百萬元，終至成為吾國改革幣制的一個主要原一因。</p>
<p>（三）中國改革幣制與世界銀市</p>
<p>中國受世界銀潮的激　，金融枯竭，工商一　襄落，政府遂於十一月四日宜布新貨幣制度，集中現銀，統一發行，停止兌現，規定中。中。交三行無限制買賣外匯以穩定匯率，這消息當天就影響到倫敦銀市，投機商預料此後中國集中現銀，世界銀市將缺少白銀供給，銀價由十九·三便士漲到十九·五便士，但這種預料不久便明白了，中國供給白銀是繼續進行的，穩定外匯是必須以白銀爲交換的，銀價在第二天又回復原狀。據英國經濟週報所載，此後中國會利用高銀價在倫敦售出白銀，從前擾亂中國金融的銀價，至此對中國的外匯準備　有帮助，直到美國變更購銀程序，中國才把白銀改運紐的，在此須附帶聲明者，即中國在倫敦售銀一事，並不見於倫敦統計，這是需要　外加以研究的。</p>
<p>惟中國之後，十一月九日香港改革幣制，頒令禁銀出口，管理滙兌，但此專早在倫教銀市意料之中，故並無若何影響。</p>
<p>（四）美國變更購銀程序</p>
<p>美國最初以響亮的口號發動銀政策，第一，耍提高東方國家的購買力；第二，要恢復世界半數以上人民的銀本位貨幣制度：第三，比較車爲深刻而並不公然揚言的，要把牠當作貨幣戰爭的武器，建立美國久已企圖的複本位制度，這些目的，到一九三五年十二月，一一悲劇地收　了。十八事月的銀潮使中國，墨西哥，香港，被迫改革幣制，使意大利，西班牙，奧大利，秘魯等國减少銀貨流通。除了美國和阿比西尼亞以外，世界半數以上人民的銀本位貨幣制度不復存在了。</p>
<p>銀政策一方面有效地擊破弱國的貨幣制，相反地授予美國貨幣戰爭的敵人以利用的機會，英鎊勢力擴大了範圍，日本獲得意外的利益，並且因此發動了華北事件。美國徒然以四四二百萬美元的高價屯積了七七五百萬盎斯的白銀，距離原定金三銀一的金銀比量，並十六與一的金銀比便，依舊十分遙遠，美國至此不得不顧應到國內外嚴重的情勢，改　購銀程序。十二月九日起逐漸减少倫敦購銀數量，轉向用銀國及產銀國直接購進，銀價因此一瀉千里。倫敦由十二月七日的　十九便士降到月底的二十二便士：紐的由十二月九日的六角五分降到月底的四角九分；孟買由十二月九日的六十五難比降到月底的五十三羅比。世界銀市一時陷於混亂狀態，允以倫敦為最。</p>
<p>美國此舉，起初有人料係改變貨幣政策的前兆，世界貨幣將重新陷入更大的紛亂，其實祇是美國由攻勢取守勢的一種轉變，其目的在挽救過去的失敗，而予投機商以猛烈的打擊。在中國經這此銀價劇跌以後，可以减少白銀一命運，司時轉變白銀移動的方向。</p>
<p>（五）世界銀市的現勢</p>
<p>美國變更購銀程序以後，銀市轉入第二階叚，紐的銀市有超越倫敦之勢，中國，墨四哥，印度等國的白銀大都直接運往紐約，從去年十二月九日到今年二月十四日止，美國進口白銀値七千萬美兀以上，其中購自倫敦者值七百萬英鎊，的合美金三千萬兀以上，（一時無法正確折價）來自中國者值。千　百五十萬美元，同時倫教銀市則因美國减少少購銀，銀貨流動頓形减少，列表如下：</p>
<p>美國變更購銀稈序前後的倫敦現銀流動表單位千鎊</p>
<p>根據英國經濟週報編製</p>
<p>把上表詳經檢閱，這次舉動前後的現銀流動狀態便可瞭如指掌了。這裏可注意的第一點，是變動後倫教現銀的輸入不减，　輸出减少，其—因為輸往美國銀量的邀退；第二點是日本輸往倫敦的銀量也逐漸减少，最後兩週更甚，香港與英國有特殊關係，故反見增加，總之倫敦銀市的勢力已漸漸削弱了，不過倫敦爲世界重要銀市的資格是不食失掉的。</p>
<p>再從銀貨的流動轉到銀價的檢討，在銀市變動以後，紐約和倫敦的銀價脫離了連鎖關係，紐約不等倫敦的電報，直　掛牌，孟買則大致購跟着倫敦的銀價，茲將二處最近銀價（係據路透電）列表如下：</p>
<p>一九三五年十二月七日（銀市變動前常價）</p>
<p>倫敦　紐約　孟買</p>
<p>便士　角　羅比</p>
<p>一九·一八七五　六·三七五　六四·八七至〇</p>
<p>十二月二十七日（銀市變動後一月內之最低價）</p>
<p>倫　敦　紐　的　孟　買</p>
<p>二〇·八七五〇　四·九七　〇　　二·五〇〇〇</p>
<p>一九三六年一月三日（一月份最高價）</p>
<p>倫　敦　紐　的　孟　買</p>
<p>三·五〇〇　四·九九五　五四　〇〇〇〇</p>
<p>一月十七日（一月份最低價）</p>
<p>倫　敦　紐　的　孟　買</p>
<p>一九·〇〇〇〇　四·五七　〇　四七·四五〇〇</p>
<p>一月十四日（二月份最高價）</p>
<p>倫　敦　紐　的　孟　買</p>
<p>二〇·〇〇〇〇　四·四七五〇　五〇·　　〇〇</p>
<p>一月六日（二月份最低價）</p>
<p>倫　教　紐　的　孟　買</p>
<p>一九·四三七五　四·四七五〇　四八·六八七五</p>
<p>二月二十三日（最近銀價）</p>
<p>倫　敦　紐　的　孟　買</p>
<p>一九八七五〇　……　五〇·一八七五</p>
<p>這裏可以看出去年十二月七日至二十七日是銀價的劇跌時期，二十七日以後到最近的二個月中間，銀價已漸趨平穩，允其在上月份內（二月）絲的銀價已穩定在四四·七九，倫敦與孟買的銀價起伏也極小，這幾天來倫敦銀市因印商買進甚多，市價無再跌之勢。</p>
<p>銀價前途與中國貨幣</p>
<p>目前銀價已有暫時的穩定，但這能維持多少時間呢？這是一個難答的問題，美財團表示分析出來，作爲一種理解上的測度。據現在國外的銀市專家判斷，此後銀價將不致過份下跌，二十便士以下的降落是蜚常遲緩的，因爲白銀當作政治上工具的鬥爭時期已經過去，牠將重新以商品的資格出現，旣是商品必須和其他有關聯的商品保持一種比價，從歷史的統計研究，銀價應當維持在二十便士左右，此說證之二個月來倫敦銀市情形頗有見地，儘管美國在倫敦的購銀量　漸减少，而銀價自十二月二十日到最近始終保持在二一·七五與十九便士之間，足見白銀的商品性已經立定，世界銀市已相當澄淸。但有二個條件是必須加以注意的，第一，美國的銀政策倘使突然改變，而拋出巨量白銀，則此說不能成立，第二，銀價商品性的穩定也不是永久的，白銀在商品的性質上，選趕不上鎳，白銀用作裝飾品，會發生化學作用，而且銀的產量不像其他礦物，在供過於求時可以停止開採，銀是一種副副產品，無從加以限制，所以白銀的最後價格，並不能拿歷史的比價來測度。</p>
<p>不過據目前的情勢，銀價不再過跌的判斷是可信的，那麼對於中國的貨幣會發生何種影響呢？表面看來，銀價的穩定將使海外銀價依舊高出國內銀價百分之十以上，則此後中國的白銀外流問題將不能完全消除了。政府的統制政策勢難收盡全國銀貨，也難應一國外某種勢力的侵蝕，銀價穩定，豈非將有害於中國的貨幣制度麼？這是不然的，我們當認濟中國貨幣問題目前的關鍵不是白銀問題而是外滙問題與管理問題，偷運在此後已不足破壞新貨幣制度，而中，中，交三行無限制買賣外滙的堅持才是重耍的關鍵，所以國人對於政府最近的售銀事件大可用平靜的眼光來觀察，銀價的穩定，正使中國貨幣有漸决鞏固的機會。</p>
<h3 id="c162">去年銀價變動之回顧 <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— 謝菊曾</p>
<p>去年（民國二十四年）銀市　勛之烈，為民九以來所代號見，最訓峰每達三六辦土二五，蓋世界白銀本位之消滅，曁白銀市塲之失序，莫不受此政策之賜也。</p>
<p>至於去年一年中。每月銀市變動之經過。一可於左表覘之。</p>
<p>當年度開始之際，倫敦銀市現貨爲二四。六二五，遠期爲二四·七五。在一月份中，市價上落殊微。其時美國對於任何過剩白銀之吸收，甫吿滿足，未施壓力。而印度投機家購人　，中國售出。月杪雖因某大物產公司之經濟困難，致東方感受貨幣威脅，顧極少影響於銀布。加以時屆我關春節休假，而美園最高法院對於金條交之判決，尚未確定，故在一月最初二星期中，市况至爲寗靜。特自十四日起，因投機家忽有需要，故市價由隔日之一四·四三七五，逐步上升至二十八日乃爲二五·六八七五。在此一時期中，中國平準基金方面，曾有巨量收買；崦印度政府亦於月杪宣佈白銀進口稅由五安尼減至二安尼。三月份市價變化較煩，半緣英鎊美金比價之移動所致。其問主要之變動係在二十二日至二十六日。蓋因投機家一聞美上院已通過湯姆斯對工作救濟案之修正案　，認為政府必將　大　銀程序，爭事購入，故市價遂漲上一。六八七五，　此案立被下院推翻，結果銀價又下落〇·四三三五。時則美國政府收買，中國售出，印度及倫敦當地之投機家，出納不一，市况未有變化。在四月第一星期中，美國購銀之訊沈寂，市價仍在二八。五之下。至九日因美父復收購，更引起中印之新買入，於是十日市價遂上升至一八·九三七五。是日美政府並將國內銀價由美金〇。六四五元提高至〇。七一一一元，因此在十日至十二日之三日中，市價漲起二·三七九而爲二一。三一二五。在此水準之下，多顯獲利了結中國各銀行之賣出者，數頗不實，於是市價復回至三〇·七五。復活節後，各方惑於銀集團之種種宣言，東方業此者大事不限價購入，於是市價山十八日之三〇·九三七五，漲至二十六日之三六·二五，是爲本年度之最高記錄。蓋當二十四日美政府將國內銀價由〇·七一一一元提高至零。七七五七元，的等於倫教之三五辦士，而是日英京正式市價，則爲三二·八一二五。復以美國方面盛傳國內銀價，將逐漸提高至一。二九元，屆時世界銀價。與之相差當不甚遠。因此激動買氣，至四月二十六日下午，買方茶有願出價至三七辦士者。</p>
<p>方甚時也，墨西哥對此情勢，殊覺惶慮，急向華盛頓方面陳說，以爲萬一畢國所有通貨，悉被吸收出境，爲害之烈不可勝言；良以美國繼續施行提高銀價政策，將使尚用　本位之國家所有白銀，被逐出境，如美國購銀程序一日完成，有以致之也。嗣後美國宣布禁止銀幣進口，施於隔日復加以詮釋，市價下跌。七五、而爲三二。九三七五。旋悉購銀法案與此無涉，月杪市價乃又回至三三。五六二五。此時美政府對銀市不甚活動，故交易僅限於投機。至六月四日，跌落一辦一士，美財部始加人買方。至十九日，又降半辦士，印度大事售出，交易極旺。此項印銀之出售，以及中國與倫敦當地投機家之供給，繼續不斷，迄於月杪爲止。但美國之收買力，並不堅强，故市價逐漸降爲三十辦士。</p>
<p>先是當四五月之交，市價上下於三六·二五及三二·三七五間時，所經營之多頭，均於六月秒及七月初旬滿期。投資者加以不愿再了結掉期二個月。故在七月五日上午，印度大事售星期六）爭事了結，市價幾至無法收拾。經紀市價僅微跌〇·三一二五，而爲三〇·六八七五，美政府曾照此價購入一千萬盎斯。嗣後數日中，曾一度回上外，直至八月十日止，迄無變化。一其守交易淸淡，間有投機家從事了結，而惟一一之買主，則爲美政府。</p>
<p>八月十二日，市况又變，至十五日乃由三〇·一八七五降至二九辦七。時則美財部將價格抑低〇·〇六二五，殆以美余滙率軟糾之故。因此引起中印兩處之巨量拋賣，成交數量之巨，超過本年已往記錄。據華盛頓方面聲稱，美政府僅於十四日一日中，在倫敦購入白銀二千五百五十萬盎司。至十五日現貨市價加〇。〇六二五，尚爲民國二十三年八月十日以後第一次所見。嗣是直至十二月七日止，美政府迄未將美金購價變動。而倫敦市價之起伏，亦僅依熒兀匯率之上落爲止。其時美政府繼續吸收各地供給之現貨白銀，而出售者以香港方面爲一主。至八月二十三日，市價現貨突張至二九。一四三七五，期貨二九·三七五，特此僅因中印一時需要遠期之放，而現貨市價不過車帶務動一耳。迨需要消滅，賣風復烟矣。十月初　，意一阿戰事旣作，英匯軟弱，投機家　有一度需要一，現貨市買於五日復升至二九。六二五，期貨則爲二九。七五，但至十七日，改爲二九。三一一五。直至十一月二十二日止，美國買價，始終未有更動。旋以美國需要漸减，而香港等處，拋棄不斷，此價在十一月二日，會减低〇·四三七五。</p>
<p>同時我國財政金融，迭　美國購銀程序之影響，日形不安。上海匯率十月一日爲一先令六辦士六八七五，至十一月二日跌至一先令二辦士八七五。香港匯率，亦呈同樣變動。至十一月四日，中央政府宣布停止銀本位，採用通貨管理，收白銀爲國有，固定幣值爲一先令二辦十半。以中中交二行紙幣爲法幣，代替銀圓行使。港政府亦繼之禁銀出口，但此舉除遏阻中國售銀外，於整個銀市無甚影響。至十二月五日，香港政府放棄銀本位，一切辦法，與我國十一月中施行者相同。此後二日間，銀市對之似覺漠然。但至九日，因美國突然補手，倫　經紀人直至下午，始克與美當局商定，將市價抑低〇·四三七五。越日巨量白銀，紛紛求售。而購者寂然，市價無從决定。此等情况，一實爲氏國三年七月歐戰以來所未帶有者也。嗣後銀市遂未有違期交易。以言市價，則由七日之二九。一八七五，跌至二十四日之二〇。八七五。所幸十二月份交易，仍能安然交割淸楚，尚屬差强人意者也。</p>
<p>至於美國在倫敦購銀情形，亦有一述之必要。自八月中旬至十二月之初，美當局按日有購銀委託書寄往英京，附有顯明之諒解條件，即倫敦市價，不得規定在美國銀價之下是也。當時英倫方面，力守此的不渝。迨至十二月第一星期，美國改向他處購銀，而向倫敦所購者，其數量達遜他處。此項政策之突然變更，遂使銀市一時陷於混亂。迨美財長毛根韜發表談話，設明美國所以改變方針之故，於是局勢稍呈淸朗。第一此　志在擯斥一般投機家，良以此輩每以美國之購買爲交易之準繼也。但促成美國改變方針者，母寗調爲係中國放棄銀本位所致。</p>
<p>按美國在去年一年中，在英京所購白銀，約近三九〇兆盎司。與民二十三之八六兆相較，增加不可調不巨。在民二十三歲杪，美國存金約八，二三八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元。對於白銀每盎司係按一·二九元計算。據佔計所得，美國欲獲二成半之白銀準備，以與七成半之黃金准傭對峙起見，至少應購入白銀，一五九六兆盎司。但在民國二十四年中。美國仍大事吸收黃金，則其比例當然隨之增加，查去年中美國所存金銀數字。有如下列。（單位百萬）</p>
<p>觀乎此，可知美國去年購入白銀。雖達四七〇兆　司之巨。而其所用以抵銷差額者，為數僅一八〇兆盎司，而又適當售戶紛繫之一年中，尚未能饜彼慾壑；然最近（廿五年二月廿二日）華盛頓電訊，白銀派領袖表示，於本屆議會中，已放棄再作任何提高白銀地位之希望；蓋一則通貨膨脹派急欲膨脹通貨，二則美財部已缺乏提高銀價之興趣，三則銅鋁鋅等金屬之價格，一日不能提高，則美國銀礦之開採，自難有利可圖，即有任何法案，亦屬徒然，故一般觀察，亦以爲白銀已不再成爲一種重要間題矣。</p>
<p>至去年一年中，印度政府出售白銀，的爲二〇兆盎司；俄國的一六兆盎司，葡萄牙似已停止購銀，大陸諸園亦無多大買賣，而白銀之由日本出口者，竟占八五·五兆盎司。其中七盎司的產自日本銀礦，此外之大部分，殆由中國方面私運而去也。</p>

<p>有人吿訴我說，「一萬米競走的，在舉步時的幾百米內，關係極巨，因爲在初舉步時，便列前茅，大有先聲奪人之勢。到了九千米走過之後，錦標已經在望了，這時候，大家都脚裏明白，不可放鬆。在中途，雖然也未必不緊張，但總差一些。因此，看萬米競走，只須看一個起迄已够。」</p>
<p>有人吿訴我說，「離別一事，最足使人感奮的，是離的開始與完結。在車站輪埠上，可嚀話別事，總有些不盡依依，更其是少男少女的離別，儘有泣不成聲的。但到離別告終，重行聚首時，其情緒之緊張，自然也是難於繪述的。在這二個距離之間，雖不免於有二地相思之苦，但事後回憶，一切甜酸苦辣的味兒，似乎都在離合的二個時期而已。」　有人吿訴我說，「新婚的滋味眞好」。也有人吿訴我說，「白頭偕老的滋味眞好。」但是中年的夫婦，十對之中，至少有六七對，是面和心不和，三日一吵而四日一鬧。</p>

<p>— 胡楚玉</p>
<p>窖蟲</p>
<p>梅的窖蟲很多，如油蟲最易在嫩葉上繁殖，葉爲油蟲所窖，就要縮卷，次見，可用殺虫劑灌注，但盆梅最可恐者，爲梅薰蛾的幼虫，這虫專食梅芽，春季梅芽萌後，幾盡爲所食。虫身長四五分，脊爲暗揭色，腹部紅色，與梅樹的皮色相類，有短毛，黃色條斑，潛伏在梅的枝幹間，或樹皮中間，到了春暖時期，非常活動，往往爲這虫所害，致梅枯死。這虫成熟的蛹，是在四月下句至五月初，至六月初，變爲蛾，就飛到梅葉產卵，有葉時食葉，葉落後嚙樹皮，出芽時專食芽，所以當秋季梅葉生後，在葉面要仔細撿查，一旦發見害虫，即用殺虫劑殲滅，不使繁殖。其他還有一種芯虫，這虫當初夏新梢伸長時，專食嫩芽，形極微細，爲綠色細長的甲蟲。又有一種梅蝨，伏在葉上，形如麋芥，梅葉上給這虫樓止後，葉的正面，變爲白色的淡斑點，普通的殺虫劑，不會死滅，須用硫黃合劑驅除，這虫專吸葉中的養分，爲害很大，愛梅家應當特別留心的。</p>
<p>梅苗的繁殖法</p>
<p>梅的繁殖，分法爲實生，接木，揷種三種等，盆栽的梅，如爲實，可生活十八年至二十年。接木要有專門的技術，挿種作苗培養，經過數年後，再可移植盆中培養。挿種的方法。在春分前後爲最適宜，但依各地而不同，大概以花已落，葉芽逐漸膨大時揷種，容易活的。揷種的穗，應用前年的新梢，而且要選探充分受過日光，枝勢伸長而屈曲的，切成五六寸長，切口用銳利小刀，一刀切斷，不使切口切碎，若用剪鋏剪碎，必要腐敗不會發芽的。又所切的梅種，如過於短，旣不易生活，發生的根亦必惡劣。揷種的苗床，用赤土多的土地，以沒有水溜爲宜，土深的三四寸。若在庭園的角做苗床，可先把土掘深一二尺，反覆掘掏，總使土壤柔軟，上面用赤土與砂混合，使水容易滲透，保持適當的濕度。插種後，到了秋夭，就會仲長一二尺，至第二年春，可合己意的都分剪切，再行栽種，不過這年應充分施肥。普通過了三年，可望開花，揷種如得其法，實比接木爲好，因爲接木的接口，往往膨脹，極不美觀，揷木與實生相同，可免道種缺點的。</p>

<p>— 楊晋豪</p>
<p>爲社會主義的現實主　的蘇聯的繪畫，是展　着新的内容和新的技術。</p>
<p>在靑年會中蘇聯版畫在華第二次的展覽室裏，碰見了悲鴻。</p>
<p>『他們的表現確是眞實。固然我們也需要想像，然而却要根據眞實…』。他向我這樣地談着。</p>
<p>然而，他們的眞實，却叉因爲社會生活之與各資本主義國家的殊異，而在題材和技術上顯出了不同。</p>
<p>蘇聯的人民，因爲他們的戰鬬力量，巳經逐漸由對人而聽向於到自然，因爲那成爲特殊階級的藝術家，轉化而爲人民大衆的共同生活者，因爲各個人脫離了一切傳統觀點的束縛，而得自由發展他們的技能，於是，昔離了目前各國的藝壇，而榮長了與衆不同的奇葩。</p>
<p>木刻之在蘇聯的所以著有成效，是因爲在那充滿了生活力的社會之中，是需要像這一種單純而有力的作品，來諷刺，振奮，而刺戟一般忠厚的大衆：好像含有戰關性的「雜文」一樣，它們是前進的藝術小品。</p>
<p>此地，除掉木刻之外，倒是一些水彩，鉛筆，摩諾和墨色，引起了我更大的注意。</p>
<p>在技術上，各種繪畫工具的粽合運動，是打破了單一工具在表現時的困難。這個背棄傳統表現方法的技巧，顯然是獲得了高度的成功。他們不但用毛筆，而且，同時也用鉛筆，也用鋼筆，甚而至於也用刻刀，只要繪出方便，是可以採用各種手技，而不必爲某一種範圍所約東的。這是創造　需品的眞實的勝利。像那　諾繪法巴爾托所作的受傷之鳥，一隻與惡運掙扎着的鳥的兩翼和它的各部份的羽毛，那精　的筆觸，决不是單純的油畫或水彩所能畫出的。再如列　特所作的造橋的機器化，則在同時利用了鋼筆和水彩。所作的尼泊　江岸之起重機則除了水彩之外，還利用了鉛筆畫綫。這種畫法，是適應着了印刷術進步了的今日。</p>
<p>在精神上，我們在那兒看不見享樂或憂　的題材，他們所畫的，都是一些活潑，沉殺和戰　的神態。例如安托諾夫所作的足球，是表現着蘇聯的少年的活潑壯健的生活。喀伸娜所作的文化休息公園，是表現着蘇聯民衆的娛樂，同時灌輸着健康的文化知識。允其是許多機械工程的描寫，如多爾米且托夫所作的尼泊爾江水閘之建造及鍋爐之裝置，包洛夫所作的造船廠運木船之下水準備等等，是顯示着蘇聯社會主義建設運動的積極奮勉，並且，一般民衆對於這種工作的明切認議和深感與趣，使那作爲先覺者的藝術家們，溶合於這種生活之中，眞忱有力地廣泛地寫實着，成爲鼓勵與推動的力量的這一種抓住了偉大史蹟的繪畫，是給大衆以加緊努力的興奮。</p>
<p>但是，像這一種畫品，在遍佈着經濟恐慌的空氣，流行着　悶痛苦的病症，並且忽視着芳動者的生產工程，而藝術作家又沒有這一種實感的其他各國，是不會，也不能產生這一種偉大生動的創作的。只有在五年計劃已經成功，而又繼續進行中的蘇聯，只有在消除了階級身份，而全體人民打成了整片創造力量的蘇聯，道才俱有這一種勝利的條件。</p>
<p>還有許多人像，風景，揷圖，和歷史聱等，雄健，壯麗，輕鬆，嚴肅，但各充滿一片活力，是都很名貴的。</p>

<p>我們人類爲甚麼要分兒童時代，靑年時代，壯平時代，老年時代呢？而在這幾個時期中，雖同是一個我，但面貌，形態，爲甚麼又都改變了呢？推究其原因，這完全是因細胞的「新陳代謝」改變了我們的外形的緣故。就生理上計算人身新陳代謝的作用，不過七年，全身必另換一個，特其變遷和緩而微細，我們不自覺罷了。</p>

<p>蓄鳥之以籠，猶藏嬌之以金屋也。籠之大小高低，須視鳥之織碩文武而配置，，有不容混淆者。製籠之名家一爲崑山杜某，稱爲杜家籠。杜某生於前淸同治間，所製雅而不俗，爲作家所難能，然一經紅羊刧火，市間無復有存。光緒初常熟梅鳳林之黃頭籠，亦負有盛譽。此籠宜於蓄　脚鳥，人爭購之。福山王某仿製之王籠，徒得其形似，不之逮也。又周載臣父子，製絞絲冰梅刻花秀眼籠，惟以雕琢琢細見炫，實無可取。此中佳品，當推直甫籠爲第一。直甫，姚姓，吳郡人。愛秀眼成癖，乃自製金絲竹籠，而籠絲眼之步弓，節節不同，人不能仿，惜所製祇數事，重金不易覓購也。聞鍚山蔣某，有直甫籠一，伴以凌居士鈎，古窰缸，子母綠之什件，古茂殊常，蔣某以懷實視之，人亦見而噴嘖生羨也。近今市上充斥者，爲金三畏之金絲籠，則自　以下矣。</p>

<p>春來了，這一羣快樂的鴨子，却最先投到伊的懷抱中。</p>

<p>— 家爲</p>
<p>報載閘北橫浜路某里，有空屋一所，已經被法院的封條封閉了，不料，一天晚上，那屋的墻壁上，忽被竊兒掘了一個大窟，進去偷搬了許多東西。後經北站偵緝分隊陸續拘獲與是案有關的大批竊犯；最大者年只十五歲，一人；共餘三人年只十三歲，都是未成年的孩子。餘收贓犯一人，也只十八歲。現已經送總局發落云。</p>
<p>關於偷竊盜刦一顏的不法事件，在今日這個千瘡百孔的社會組織之中，原正是日必數起而方興未艾着呢！可不見嗎？上海前有大學生作偷兒而坐了牢，抗州有大學生作强盜而被處了死刑……等等，已經成了平常的事。</p>
<p>不過，在這些不顧不義取」的不法之徒中，爲着生活所驅使，經濟所壓迫，去挺而走險的，恐怕要佔去大半的份兒吧？當然，其他像在今日這個老古的封建殘餘　羼着糜腐的資本主義文明殘渣而成的社會環境之下，所產生的「不務正業，游手好閒」之徒，也是所必經的下策！</p>
<p>然而，這些都是爲成年而少壯的靑年與中年人吧了。我們却少有聞見上面所引的那些十三四歲的兒童，會那樣有計畫地結團作偷竊的勾當的（當然，在小販攤王竊取一個大餅，或一只桔子的小孩，是常有所見的；不過却終不會有這幾個孩子那樣的老成」吧？）</p>
<p>在這里，當然有人又將歸之於今日敎育的破產了。不錯。不過我們却也不能儘忽略了敎育與社會的關係，以至於牠破產的基本原因。</p>
<p>不是嗎？救救孩子們……」的呼聲，已經呌的有多久了？然而這事件却給了我們個什麼的啟示呢？</p>
<p>高唱了好久的「義務敎育」，以至實施了半年有餘的「强迫敎育」，他們的成果，恐怕也只有這些吧？</p>
<p>果然，每星期更有許多電影院在放映着「兒童敎育電影」吧？然而所放映的片子，有幾多是稍能帶有「敎育」意義的吧？而且，對於這類以偷竊爲生的街頭浪子，究有了多大的關係呢？</p>
<p>好了，總之一切的一切，再偉大不過的，也終脫不了這個社食的牢籠吧！？</p>
<p>所以，我們要呌」救救孩子們！」那該從那裏着手呢？大家努力着吧！</p>

<p>— 沈塢</p>
<p>黃昏，我們眞的要出了。竹老頭自言自語的咕囉了一會，說什麼大淸早就給孩子們追老鴉，日子有什麼不利；又哆嗦什麼不積德，不應隨便殘害生物：殺生十……這老頭子照例哆嗦了一會，就默默地去收拾自己的行裝，去給觀音菩薩的神位燒香，念念咒語去了。</p>
<p>這回的隊伍眞够威風，十來條長槍，加上老閻和老莫的兩支短傢伙，浩浩蕩蕩的就朝山徑里去。老閣騎上胡大頭的棗馬，挺直了腰，押着我們的隊伍，更顯得威風十足，村里的孩子們都以奇異的眼睛在呆望着我們，直到村落的影子漸漸遠離我們而去。</p>
<p>過了兩個險峻的山峯，岩石離奇古怪地在山徑里滿佈着，亂草長得很高，有時還遮着前而的去路，山路崎嶇，走起來非常吃力。一到山抝里，老閻的威風已經滅煞了一大半，他不再押在隊伍的後面，漸漸地夾在人叢的中間。我們大家都靜默着，只顧望着山徑走。</p>
<p>天色漸漸沉黑了，太陽落到地平綫下去，滿天的紅霞反映在山叢里，映出很美麗的山色。但是這一瞬間的黃昏的山色，很快的就給黑暗呑噬了。我們在黑暗的山野間走路，更覺得困難多了。不知是誰把手電筒找開了，一道白光明朗地透射出來，然而卻一下子就給老閻罵倒了。於是大家只好依舊摸索着走，一顚一顚的踏上崎嶇的山路，前面是無邊的黑暗。</p>
<p>山徑一時高一時低，走前鋒的有時把不穩步子常常摔倒了好幾次。這回轉了一個灣山，山徑又低窪下去，周圍的亂草很高，岩石也生得很突兀。前鋒的幾個人突然都捧倒了，而且都一下子爬不起來，好象還有誰一徑滾下去。老宋把手電筒亮了，照了照，好象有幾根繩子橫在山路上，老閻却在後面大聲吆喝着，說不要亮手電筒，喝聲還沒停止，幾口冷然的步槍聲就響了，老宋敏感地息了手電筒，老閻慌忙得不知所措；馬嘶着，竹老頭也慌張了起來。……</p>
<p>槍聲越來越多，漸漸緊密了。我們十來桿長槍終於也登了峯，只有幾條擔子和一匹馬留在山徑里。然而我們却找不到敵人的目標，只胡亂地還了幾口火，抵抗着敵方的威燄。</p>
<p>在槍聲的緊密中，有人慘然地呌着，這聲音離我們很近，我們不禁吃了一驚，心里有點異樣地跳動的漸漸地在火光里，我們發現了敵人包圍的陣勢了，大家躲在草叢和岩石之間還火，槍聲愈來愈密。人的呼號也越發凄愴了。可是一下子我們却聽到敵方的槍聲漸漸遠了開去，終於冷冷地回答幾槍，就靜止了</p>
<p>老宋立卽從岩石的遮蔽中，走下山徑來，用手電筒朝呼號里照耀，馬已經失踪了。竹老頭子慢然地倒在地上，大腿上流着一灘血。老閻在山抝亂草間縮做一團。……</p>
<p>我們把竹老頭扶了起來，有人在山野間找了些山藥來給他敷着傷口。他喘着氣在呢喃地呼呌：「不積積德？……一早就逐烏鴉！……不吉利的呢！……我老是說：小孩子不聽話……</p>
<p>我們沒說話，只是沉默着。山野間依舊是無邊的黑暗和冷寞，夜正長呢。</p>

<p>— 華木</p>
<p>偶爾在友人家裏留給一晚，睡室正面向一條馬路，談倦歸睡之後，雷燈關熄了，馬路兩旁商店門數上綴嵌的霓虹燈光，合成一道五顏六色的光影，流入房子裏來，又反照在一塊彩畫屏鏡上面。看到這種幽豔炫麗的光影，心像觸着輕微的電流似地，幽幽浮起一種言說不出的炫惑來；輕佻一點說，那是有類於迥腸蕩氣的情形罷？我本來有厭床的歪習氣，今晚不能好好的睡是料想得到的。可是，我并不因此生惱，常常就覺得失眠也未常不是一椿苦痛的快意事：半床暖褥，長夜寂然，儘由得人天上間，東南西北的去作出各種各樣奇瑰矞皇的幻夢來，或者就咀嚼那拋在生命過程中的悲歡哀樂的陳跡。總比身一貼蓆就泥然睡去有意趣得多。這都是日間人事匆忙之中不容易享受得到的閒情。</p>
<p>時候已臨近午夜了。炫於樓外光影的迷惑，外裝雖然卸下，也沒有上床去睡，倚在一扇玻璃窗邊，探首下瞰，油光的柏油地，汽車偈水一般流過去，燈光照在漆亮的車甲上，幌耀起一團光炫來，息瞬之間又滑過去了，隱隱拋下一陣震盪，帶着軋士林的氣味，浮散在空氣中，就這船流過去，流過來，交織成一種繁鬧而喧囂的聲態。原來前頭不遠那座高　夜空放着炫彩的大樓，就是某大舞　，這個時候正是紳士貴女驅車前復查宴樂的時會。半年來都是住在效外的時候多，對於都市夜的情調已漸覺陌生起來，住在郊外時也是在一個俯臨村路的小樓上，那裏的午夜只有一片凄清的冷靜。偶爾有個過路的行人，在細砂路上　着單調的步履，或者有一聲不甚自然的嗆咳，惹得數聲悠悠的犬吠，都會使人覺到這完全是那兒的山村僻壤，并不曾想到距隔數里之遙那邊，就是軟紅擾攘的十里洋塲，此外，是風雨無間的賣餛飩的梆子，舒徐緩慢的敲着，在門前走過去，也是帶着很濃厚的中世風的調子，是一種富於催眠性的閑適的幽趣，無一點色情味的刺激糅雜在那　韻　。對於那樣的一種境界，已無所云愛好，也無由生起倦厭，正哪今夜觸到的都市夜的色情的炫惑，雖不免有點陌生，到底也是親切融合的感覺居多。縱說會失眼，那只能歸咎於素昔養成的厭床習氣的。這不是强詞蠻辯。</p>
<p>因此我覺得上海之可愛，而使人迷戀，就怕全是流織於夜分的那種明顯强烈的色情味的刺激。假若沒有夜分的繁華絢豔的燈影，調節着喧囂的市聲和姿容，一到夜裏就變了黑暗世界，無聲無動，日裏縱是車水馬龍，喧圖竟日，也會失了繁華的意味，住在上海，若使只看到日間的塵囂，沒領略到夜分的光和色，聲和趣，那只能說是算看到了，懂得了，上海之半面。有人常常發出一種浮誇的議論，把上海詛咒得成了住不得人的魔窟。這實在不免意氣用事，矯枉過正了。自然，說上海就是人世天堂，貧富樂土也是不必的。它固然使人隨落，使人損生，也供應了不少人們的生活的糧食：撇開好壞不說，功過總算相抵。就以今夜的情形說罷，我固然在小樓中心怡目悅的欣賞着樓外的車聲，炫艶的景色，說不定鄰家樓內就有人在苦惱這午夜的囂聲光色呢。</p>
<p>我果眞會受擾於這都市夜的美麗而失眠麼？不會的，那只能歸過於厭床的習氣，假使這座街樓變做自己的，那不久就可改正過來，這裏是更能給我以豊富活潑的情感呢。我羨慕友人的幸福，也羨慕有這麼一座街樓的人門。我為上海祝福了。</p>

<p>在這時候，秋華却出現在他的身前。這出現，眞是意外的。在卓民，最初見到秋華，已經有一兩年了。那時候，她的一位叔父同她到振民當時在主持着的一個刋物的辦事室裏去，當然，他那時不過當她也不過是一個女學生而已。然而在一些談吐裏，使他知道，她的能不同流合汚，靑出於藍；在一些中國的畫家中，獨欽佩丁君，而丁君是卓民所欽佩的。就是這第一印象，已够深深銘刻了。然而，振民總處處使他提醒自己已經是一個結了婚的人；雖然有深刻的最初的印象，經不起歲月的蹉跎，到後來，終究也淡了下去。</p>
<p>是在夏天，隔了一年的夏天，他又在另一塲合遇到了秋華。她的談吐是更聰俐了，舉動也更活潑動人了。從她的明媚的眼睛裏，還可以看出裏面還蘊藏着一種不可言喻，其實也並沒有什麼不可以言喻的風情。然而，在振民，他處處總自覺到他是已有妻室的人，什麼思念，一上來，便得迅速地退落下去。更何况，雖則他並不是這樣一個落伍的人，封建道德，又常常盤繞在他的心頭。就是在這一塲合之後，什麼都使他不能不放棄了。</p>
<p>是在初秋，她的叔父從×地來到上海，此外又還有幾個同伴。到了上海，少不了喝喝酒。其中有一個三十五六的年齡上已經成熟，而心裹上却極幼稚的獨身大學敎授，對於秋華，正極傾其愛慕之忱。這，在卓民是早已知悉了的，在他並希望他們能早登樂土。可是這位大學敎授畢竟是太幼稚了，他什麼也不曉得。因爲她的關係，有一天請了許多人一起喫飯，卓民在，秋華也在。她是更嫵媚了，可是在衆客嬉笑的當中，她老是沈默着。飯後，他們又到她的家中，其時，她的父母，都上靑島避暑去了，只滕了她。這一羣去，况且又在酒後，不免胡鬧了一陣，有的唱唱歌，有的莫明其妙的哄笑，而卓民却默不作聲的呆坐着，秋華也無精神的呆坐着。在衆賓疲乏了連口也不能開的時候，秋華才拿出她的那只夏威夷的六弦琴，彈奏着那凄切的夏威夷的別離曲，那動人肺腑的Aabe　ol啊！對於卓民，這別離曲，尤其使他起一種無名的悲感。這音調，猛使他浮起八年前的舊事。八年前越太平洋而至美國，船泊檀香山時的情節，以及八年來的遭過，一幕一幕地湧了上來。逝去年華，舊遊如夢，八年來所贏得的又是什麼？孤獨的悲哀，寂寞的凄切，却一年一牟隨着年齒的加高增加着。如今當秋華彈奏着這動人的夏威夷的淸絃，怎不使卓民暗暗地感到悲凉。他於是情不自禁起來的，彷彿可以藉了酒醉的名義，引高了嗓子，唱起一調一調的西洋歌曲……and　I　Know　that　someday　I'll　discoerber,thegirl　ofmy　vagabound　dream。他看了秋華看了她的蘊蓄着情意的微笑，卓民才茲發見所爲「會心」的意義。</p>

<p>開篇「三國志長板坡」</p>
<p>千古英雄說子龍。單槍匹馬去衝鋒。他是，欲尋幼主把曹營闖。雪色征袍血濺江。但見他，虎目怒睜槍亂剌。但見他，揮來實劍氣如虹。縱騎一躍入重圍去。獸鬥終朝勇氣冲。嚇得阿瞞心膽碎。探聽他，叫何名姓派曹洪。愛才不忍來加害。令全軍，活捉生擒算大功。誰知獸想難償願。冷箭從旁不敢攻。僥是一身都是膽。敵兵是，千軍萬馬困重重。尋來古井頹牆側。一是那，主母當前禮鞠躬。幾次跪求扶上馬。糜夫人昌，乘機跳入井欄中，子龍是，忙將阿斗來藏起。再束鸞　貯貼胸。忽地奔來雙敵將。子龍是，拔槍上馬戰尋雄。霎時間，槍挑劍劈把羣雄斃。只得向，長板坡頭去覓主公。一騎疾馳塵障目。但聽得，鼓聲敲得響　。忽見那，張飛立馬橫予視。攔住將軍不放鬆。問他何處駐遊蹤。</p>

<p>Xu Shiying arrived in Tianjin at 7:00 AM on the Ping-Hu through train. Qin Dechun and Xiao Zhenying took a special train early in the morning to meet him at Cangzhou, conveying Zheyuan's regards. Upon arrival at the station, Wang Yitang, Lu Zongyu, and key figures from various municipal organs welcomed him. His entourage, accompanied by Cheng Xigeng, continued to Beiping on the original train. Xu, accompanied by Qin and Xiao, disembarked and went to the municipal government for refreshments. At 8:00 AM, they took a special train to Beiping together. Xu said that he had not been north for ten years since leaving the old capital. This visit was to conclude disaster relief work and settle private affairs, and he would return south on the 2nd. On the 4th, he would visit Foreign Minister Zhang and various ministers to discuss final matters before going abroad. On the 5th, he would go to Shanghai and, if there were no changes, would take the Asama Maru on the 7th to take up his post. He hoped that Sino-Japanese diplomacy could be adjusted as a whole, but how to proceed was yet to be determined. His meeting with Arita in Shanghai was of a social nature and did not involve other matters. He had no particular feelings about the Japanese political changes. He took the opportunity to visit Song in Beiping for a talk, but there was no important mission. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Xu Shiying arrived from the capital last night. Song sent Xiao and Qin to Tianjin last night to meet him. He arrived in Tianjin at 7:00 AM this morning, and Xu disembarked and went to the municipal government for breakfast. Wang Yitang met and talked with him at the municipal government. He then re-boarded the train and arrived in Beiping around 10:00 AM. Song and over a hundred others went to welcome him. After Xu disembarked, Song accompanied him to Song's private residence for lunch. During the meal, they discussed foreign policy issues in detail. Qin Dechun scheduled a banquet at the municipal government tonight to welcome Xu. Xu scheduled to go to Tianjin with Xiao Zhenying tomorrow morning. Xiao will host a banquet for Xu at the Tianjin municipal government tomorrow noon, and Xu will return to the capital tomorrow night. He will set sail for Japan on the 7th. Xu said, "I left Beiping eleven years ago. Since I will be going abroad soon, I am making a special trip to inspect the situation in North China and to informally solicit opinions on diplomacy from Song and local authorities for my reference after taking office." He will board the Asama Maru in Shanghai on the 7th to take up his post in Japan. "I have not yet received instructions on our country's foreign policy, so I have nothing to report. However, our foreign ministry hopes to convene an adjustment meeting in Nanjing for a comprehensive adjustment of relations between the two countries. Ambassador Arita and I have met twice, but both were private social gatherings." (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Zhu Zheyuan sent Xiao Zhenying and Qin Dechun on a special train to go south and meet Xu Shiying on the evening of the 29th. They arrived at Tangguantun at 4:00 AM on the 1st. The Ping-Hu through train on which Xu Shiying was traveling also arrived at the station shortly after. Xiao and Qin disembarked to meet Xu and invited him to board the special train. However, Xu had not yet gotten up in the train, so they spoke briefly and disembarked, each returning to their original train to head north. After arriving in Tianjin at 8:15 AM, Xu transferred to the special train and arrived in Beiping with Xiao and Qin at 10:30 AM. Song Zheyuan and key military and political figures all went to the station to welcome him. After Xu disembarked, he rode in the same car with Song to Song's residence in Wuyiku for sincere talks on everything. Xiao Zhenying, Qin Dechun, Chen Zhongfu, Cheng Xigeng, Chen Juesheng, and others were all present. They talked until 12:00 PM, and Song hosted a banquet to welcome Xu, inviting Wang Yitang and other members of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council to accompany them. The gathering dispersed happily at 1:30 PM. Xu then went to the Beijing Hotel to rest and met with reporters at 2:00 PM. According to the interview, "I left Beiping eleven years ago. Since I will be going abroad soon, I am making a special trip to inspect the general situation in North China and to meet with Chairman Song and local authorities to informally solicit opinions on diplomacy for my reference after taking office. I will also take the opportunity to inspect the closing and handover of the Beiping office of the Disaster Relief Committee, visit old friends, and settle private affairs. I am scheduled to go to Tianjin at 10:00 AM on the 2nd. After attending Mayor Xiao's banquet in Tianjin at 11:00 AM at noon, I will visit friends in Tianjin and then return to the capital on the Ping-Hu through train that night. After staying in the capital for a short time, I will go to Shanghai and take the Asama Maru to Japan on the 7th to assume my new post. As for our country's diplomatic policy towards Japan, I have not yet received detailed instructions, so I have nothing to report. Ambassador Arita and I have met twice in Shanghai, but both were private social gatherings and did not involve diplomatic issues," Xu said after meeting with reporters. Xu then went out to visit friends. His secretary, Hu Mai, accompanied Xu. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Xu Shiying and Song Zheyuan talked about national affairs very happily at noon on the 1st. When Song asked Xu for his opinions on foreign affairs, Xu frankly told him that to discuss diplomacy, it is necessary to first improve domestic affairs. The people of North China are suffering, so please provide relief to the people first. A country becomes strong after becoming rich, and weak after becoming poor. To make a country rich, one must first enrich the people's livelihood, which is something that cannot be ignored. Song expressed great appreciation for Xu's words.

<p>Beiping: Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, Chen Zhongfu, Chen Juesheng, and others hosted a banquet for Xu Shiying at the municipal government at 8:00 PM on the 1st, inviting key military and political figures and all members of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council to accompany them.

<h3 id="e9">The Five-Power Group in the Making <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>The American historian, S. Fay, once said that the occurrence of the First World War was due to five reasons: economic imperialism, militarism, nationalism, the promotion of war by newspapers, and secret group diplomacy. Among these five, group diplomacy can be considered the basic cause of the war. Observing the current situation in Europe, all the causes of war that existed before 1914 are present, and none has been reduced, but rather intensified, making people even more alarmed. The situation of the pre-war Triple Alliance and Triple Entente contending for hegemony in Europe and mutually undermining each other is actually re-emerging today. According to recent news from Europe, the Franco-Soviet accord and the cooperation of countries enforcing sanctions, such as Britain and France, have triggered the activities of the five-power group of Italy, Germany, Poland, Austria, and Hungary. If this kind of group becomes a reality, then the disaster of 1914 is not far off. The recurrence of history is beyond human control.</p>
<p>Before the First World War, the Central European group was the three countries of Germany, Austria, and Italy. Today's five-power group in the making includes Austria and Hungary, which are part of the old Austrian Empire, and a portion of Poland's territory was obtained from Germany. Therefore, the five-power group, geographically speaking, is almost no different from the pre-war three-power group. The three-power group aimed at Russia and France, and its leadership was in Berlin. The situation of today's five-power group is also the same. The pre-war Triple Entente began with the alliance of Russia and France, followed by the friendly consultation of Britain and France, and then the amity of Britain and Russia. The historical traces are exactly the same. The difference is that the pre-war three-power group was a combination of victorious countries. The Austro-Hungarian Empire was a country that ruled other ethnic groups, and Germany was the conqueror of Alsace-Lorraine. Today's five-power group, Germany, Austria, and Hungary, are all defeated countries. Their demands for restoring lost territories are no less than those of pre-war France, and Italy is a dissatisfied country. Poland, although the darling of the Treaty of Versailles, still has unlimited territorial desires, coveting territories in the Czech Republic and Lithuania. Therefore, the aggressiveness of the five-power group far exceeds that of the pre-war three-power group.</p>
<p>The formation of these two major camps in Europe will inevitably dim the spirit of cooperation and the ideals of peace of the League of Nations, which goes without saying. The common goal of the five-power group is to break the status quo and overthrow the European situation protected by the League of Nations, which is very clear: the demands of Italy and Germany for the redistribution of overseas colonies and the redrawing of European borders; the demands of Austria and Hungary for the recovery of old territories and the removal of economic obstacles; Poland is dissatisfied with the status quo, and its expansionist power will invade the Baltic countries and the territory of the Czech Republic. If the negotiations of the five powers are successful, then the two major groups in Europe will be suspicious, resentful, and hateful of each other. Fear and hostility will inevitably lead to the intensification of the arms race and the increasing density of the atmosphere of war. Once the balance of power is slightly shaken or military preparations reach a considerable level, the tragedy of 1914 will be repeated between the Rhine and Danube rivers.</p>

<p>Tianjin, 1st: Although there is still a northwest wind outside Dagukou, the situation remains dangerous. The ice has not melted. The Tianxing icebreaker sailed out in the morning to rescue ships in distress and search for the Haiming lighthouse ship, but it turned back due to the ice being too thick at the fort. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Although there has been a northwest wind at Dagukou port for days, the tide is not high, and there is no hope of the solid ice being blown out of the port. It is feared that the situation will be difficult to improve in the near future. Of the ships that were blown away by the wind, two have sailed to Dalian, and the whereabouts of the remaining ships are still unknown. The Tianxing icebreaker departed on the morning of the 1st to search for the lighthouse ship, but it turned back after traveling thirty miles due to the thickening of the ice layer outside the port. At present, the ships trapped are also worried about food and water shortages. The shipping industry has appealed to the Maritime Administration and Customs for relief. According to the shipping industry, since Dagukou was sealed off in December, the losses of various merchants have exceeded ten million yuan, and the prices of imported goods in Tianjin have also soared recently. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The Chang'an and other four ships sent signals on the 1st, saying that they had drifted to a location four nautical miles outside the lighthouse ship and were not in danger. However, the whereabouts of the Haiyi and Taikoo cargo ships are still unknown. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: With the Dagukou port icebound and cargo ships unable to enter, the prices of goods in Tianjin are rising, especially the prices of rice, flour, and fresh vegetables. All outward shipments are being rerouted to Qingdao for unloading, and then transported to Tianjin via the Jiaoji-Jinpu Railway, resulting in doubled freight costs and unstable commodity prices. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The ports inside and outside Qinhuangdao are covered with ice. The freezing started on the night of the 19th and is over six feet thick. The ice flow outside the sea, 300 Chinese miles away, is very slow, and passenger and cargo ships are all blocked and unable to enter. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The Japanese ship Changan Maru sailed from Dalian to Tianjin on the morning of the 1st and arrived near the old site of the lighthouse ship at Dagukou. It was surrounded by ice and sent an urgent telegram for help. The Tianjin shipping industry decided to send the Tianxing ship to assist early on the 2nd, and the Customs also entrusted it to investigate the Haiming lighthouse ship. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The Customs lighthouse ship "Haiming" and other ships drifted overseas with ice floes on Saturday and Sunday. Several icebreakers tried to find them but were unsuccessful. Today, one icebreaker departed from Tanggu, intending to pass through the ice floes in Dagukou Bay to find the missing ships, but ultimately failed to achieve its purpose. According to a report from the pilots, the ice in Dagukou Bay and other places is extremely thick, and ships cannot travel. The Chinese ship Yongheng (transliteration) is aground on the beach at Dagukou, where the water is five feet deep, but the ship draws thirteen feet. Two Chinese ships are among those trapped, and there is a shortage of food and water. Shipping industry personnel have no way to provide assistance, and the situation is very worrying. Today, a person in the local shipping industry said that he believes that ships carried overseas by ice floes will encounter swimming rafts twelve miles offshore, which will prevent the flow of ice floes. (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Four more ships were blown out of Dagukou on the morning of the 1st, but the ship names have not yet been determined. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>— Shao Shiping</p>
<p>Land Relations and Taxes in Sichuan (Continued)</p>
<p>However, there are many more dire situations. In Wanxian and other places, land leases are subject to one-sided contracts. Once farmers become tenants, they are bound by various contractual restrictions and are required to pay huge deposits. For every ten piculs of rent, a deposit of over one hundred yuan is required. If several families compete for the same piece of land, the deposit can increase infinitely. If the rent is slightly in arrears, the landlord can immediately terminate the lease and recruit another tenant. The tenant has to face lawsuits, imprisonment, beatings, and even torture and murder are not uncommon. In Lujiang, Jiang'an, and other places, rents are often arbitrarily increased, increasing by one-third within two years. The lives of tenant farmers naturally become increasingly miserable.</p>
<p>Land Tax and Levies</p>
<p>The high land tax and heavy levies in Sichuan are world-famous. Because the sustenance of more than 400,000 troops and the expenses of the government can only be taken from the people. Now let's look at a statistic.</p>
<p>Tax burden per mu of farmland in Sichuan (see Sweat and Blood, Volume 4, Issue 4)</p>
<p>Year 22 Survey: Zhangming 8.200 2.050, Guanghan 3.750 893, Qu County 4.000 1.000, Chengdu 2.560 640, Mianyang 2.030 508, Peng County 1.750 438, Neijiang 1.585 375, Ya'an 1.274 319, Guan County 1.085 271</p>
<p>The lightest land tax burden per mu (Guan County) is more than one yuan, and the heaviest (Zhangming) is more than eight yuan. The average is about one yuan and five jiao to four yuan. Compared to the productivity per mu of land in Sichuan, it is indeed very heavy. Even in the paddy field areas of Jiangnan, the land tax per mu rarely exceeds two yuan, but it is already high enough; how much more is it when it reaches more than eight yuan! Moreover, the land tax is increasing, and the burden on farmers is increasing year by year, which is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Changes in Land Tax and Percentage of Land Value in Sichuan Over the Years</p>
<p>(Survey by the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute)</p>
<p>The above table tells us how fast the land tax is increasing! From the beginning of the Republic of China to the 22nd year of the Republic of China, in these 22 years, both paddy fields and dry land have increased by about one time, and in recent years they are still continuing to rise.</p>
<p>However, we cannot understand the suffering of farmers without explaining the pre-collection of land tax. Pre-collection of land tax is the specialty of the military and political authorities in Sichuan. In the beginning of the 21st year of the Republic of China, Chengdu pre-collected until the 28th year, Chongning until the 38th year, Xindu County until the 41st year, Guang'an for 12 years, Peng'an for 24 years, and other places had similar situations to varying degrees. Currently, many places have collected up to 80 or 90 years, or 60 or 70 years, and each county collects more than ten times a year, and at least four or five times. Farmers use all their produce to pay the land tax, and there is often a risk of insufficiency.</p>
<p>However, how does such a land tax affect the big landlords? We know that they are not greatly affected. First, the big landlords cannot be separated from politics, they are important figures in local politics. Second, even if we take a step back, because the military and political authorities rely on guns to collect land tax, they cannot do so without going through their hands, so it is a good opportunity for them to profit. Third, big landlords often do not live in the countryside, or are in other counties. Moreover, due to defense zone relations, there is nothing to be done about them. The authorities implement the method of "following the land to find grain," whoever cultivates the land must pay taxes. The most unlucky ones are the tenant farmers. Naturally, small landlords who are not involved in politics and middle and poor farmers who have no way to leave the area can only be exploited. In recent years, the decline of weak and powerless landlords and the rise of new landlords who participate in political activities are also due to this.</p>
<p>The year before last, after Chairman Chiang entered Sichuan, he spared no effort to improve Sichuan's administration. Therefore, Liu Xiang telegraphed the entire province, stipulating that the land tax should be collected once a year from March 1st of this year (24th year), but before the bandit suppression military affairs are over and the army is not yet reorganized, temporary military expenses three times the amount of tax may be attached. This is tantamount to saying that the land tax for four years must be collected in one year, but it cannot be used as a pre-collection. This is naturally much better than collecting more than ten times a year.</p>
<p>But what is the situation in various places after the implementation of the new policies? We may as well take facts to illustrate:</p>
<p>According to the Dagongbao on April 14th of last year, "The Sichuan armies are still taking advantage of the opportunity to exploit as much as possible during the period of food shortage. Xinjin County immediately levied grain tax. Qionglai also started collecting new grain, and added a learning fee of 7.5 jiao per tael, limited to be cleared by the end of May. Yuechi levied 900,000 yuan, limited to be paid by the end of April, but the grain tickets were even filled in with past dates, causing the county residents to escape to Chongqing to accuse Yang Sen. According to the same newspaper on March 13th, the 28th Army, under the guise of urgent military expenses, ordered the Guan County government to start collecting grain tax for two years on March 8th (that is, eight days after the promulgation of the new policy). The situation in northern Sichuan is even more pitiful. Let us read the petition of the people of northern Sichuan, Zhang Lan, etc., to Chairman Chiang: (see Dagongbao on March 26th of last year) Yang Sen, the 20th Army Commander, killed 12,000 shi of grain in Nanchong in February of the 23rd year under the name of supplying military food, and actually resold it, causing the savings of middle-class families to be exhausted. Recently, Yang Hancheng, the Brigade Commander of the army, again dispatched 2,000 shi of grain from Nanchong, limiting the time for payment, not knowing what it was for. The army commander has now ordered Nanchong to collect grain from March 1st (that is, the day of the new policy reform -- the author), at a rate of more than 57 yuan per tael. It is found that the annual tax of Nanchong is more than 9,500 taels, and according to the old practice, each tael should only collect 7 yuan, 9 jiao, 1 cent and 3 li a year, totaling no more than 67,000 yuan. This time, the tax is 57 yuan per tael, which is equivalent to collecting eight years of grain, totaling more than 530,000 yuan, and is limited to be cleared in one month, which is shocking..." The situation in northern Sichuan is roughly the same. Southern Sichuan is also the same, let's take Gulin as an example. Gulin was originally a remote place with barren land and poor people, and suffered from the oppression of warlords and corrupt officials. The people had long been unable to make ends meet. After the "Communists" infiltrated, the large army entered the county, requisitioning grain and looting property, resulting in "ten houses out of ten empty". Unexpectedly, as soon as the "Communists" retreated, the county government immediately announced the collection of four years of land tax and 80,000 yuan of opium tax (opium seedling fine). The people could no longer bear it. Therefore, a special telegram was sent to the provincial government, requesting that "an order be issued to stop it", otherwise, "please send troops to Gulin to slaughter all 300,000 people in the county together, which would be more enjoyable". They could no longer endure the piecemeal gouging. In short, as the Chengdu Provincial Association in southwestern Sichuan complained to Chairman Chiang, "Since the implementation of the unified tax, the garrison troops in various defense zones still do not understand the great righteousness. Taking advantage of this transitional period, they collude with the heads of the regiment to intensify the squeeze on our people, forcibly taking all kinds of exorbitant taxes. The suffering of our people is even greater than before." This is absolutely true. But when will the "transitional period" be extended to?</p>
<p>Moreover, the collection of land tax is very strict, and there are as many tax collection commissioners as there are carp crossing the river. The demands and harassment are unbearable. For example, the grain tax in Zizhong County has now been collected until the 60th year of the Republic of China, and the accumulated grain arrears over the years are also more than 20,000 yuan. The county government convened the heads of various rural regiments to discuss the results, and decided to hand over the grain team to collect the arrears with interest, supervised by the heads of the regiment, and pay it off in three installments, each installment lasting 20 days. Each grain ticket must add a "food fee" of 2 jiao, and one yuan for collecting grain. The first installment adds 1 jiao of interest, the second installment adds 1.5 jiao, and the third installment adds 2 jiao. If it is not paid off within these 60 days, it will be "dealt with according to the law". This situation is not only in Zizhong, and not only when collecting grain arrears, but also the same in the collection of grain tax in various counties.</p>
<p>Other miscellaneous taxes are also varied and numerous, such as the gun purchase fee for households and militia! The militia gun fee! The militia ammunition fee! The weir repair fee! The laziness tax (not planting opium)! All kinds of names are different in each county, and the statistics of the whole province are more than 2,000 kinds, breaking the record of all provinces. No wonder there is a cry of "Our Sichuan has suffered from exorbitant taxes for a long time. Officials squeeze and suck the marrow. The desires are difficult to fill. The people endure the pain and burden of ancestors. The sweat is dry and the blood is exhausted. In the past, it was called the Land of Abundance, but now it has become a ghost cave." (The End)</p>

<p>Regarding the selection of the leader of the successor cabinet in Tokyo, the attitude of key figures is extremely cautious. Recently, it is expected that Prince Saionji, the elder statesman, will make a significant reply. It is heard that the following points are special to the successor cabinet:</p>
<p>The full intentions of the military must be respected; High-minded and sincere talents must be recruited from all parties to create a cooperative cabinet of national unity; At the same time as the establishment of the talent cabinet, diplomacy, internal affairs, finance, economy, etc. will be renewed with the people; There must be the strength to implement confident policies to refresh people's minds and demonstrate the transformation of the times and its leap forward; In order to put an end to this crisis and thoroughly implement the purpose of purifying the army, the appointment of the Minister of the Army must be the focus; When requesting to join the cabinet, there is no need to avoid whether there is party affiliation, and political parties are not the first priority. The method of talent-basedism should be adopted as much as possible to show the clarity of the political arena.</p>
<p>After putting an end to this unprecedented and ominous incident, a clear successor cabinet will be organized and specific actions will begin. Once Prince Saionji comes to Kyoto to reply to the questions, the movements of various political parties, the interactions of senior officials, and various attitudes will be on the right track. The various situations in the political arena will reach the peak of tension. This is the general observation. (A dispatch from the Allied News Agency on the 1st)</p>
<p>The Tokyo government is paying attention to various situations in order to formulate comprehensive policies for dealing with the current situation. At 10:00 AM today, an extraordinary cabinet meeting was held in the palace to discuss various measures for the aftermath. For the sake of stabilizing the public, the government decided to continue following the policy stated by Prime Minister Okada and make a public announcement after the cabinet meeting. (A dispatch from the Allied News Agency on the 1st)</p>
<p>After holding the final cabinet meeting in the Ministry of the Imperial Household today, Prime Minister Okada and all the cabinet members visited the Emperor to confess their guilt and dismantled the cabinet's branch office in the Ministry of the Imperial Household. At 4:55 PM, Prime Minister Okada, without bodyguards, took a car alone to visit the residences of various princes and made a special confession, and then returned to a temporary private residence in the city. Other cabinet members also left the Imperial Palace, so the government agencies have returned to normal. (A dispatch from the Electric Communication Agency on the 1st)</p>
<p>Since the incident on the 26th, the government cabinet members who moved to the meeting room of the Ministry of the Imperial Household have withdrawn today. Prime Minister Okada and others will hold cabinet meetings at the Prime Minister's official residence in Nagatacho at 10:00 AM every day to deal with the current situation. (A dispatch from the Electric Communication Agency on the 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e35">Selection of Successor Cabinet Members, Still Quite a Few Twists and Turns <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The rebel troops in Tokyo were completely subdued at 2:00 PM on the 29th, and the situation has come to an end. In view of the current situation, it is considered necessary to decide on the successor cabinet as soon as possible. Senior officials such as Prince Saionji are carefully considering it. However, after the fact that Prime Minister Okada, who was reported to have been killed during the suppression of the rebellion, is now actually alive was announced, a major impact occurred on the development of the political situation. However, Prime Minister Okada has submitted his resignation on the 28th, so the total resignation of the Okada Cabinet has been decided and will not give the situation a new change. Therefore, the political situation is still urgent, and the selection of the successor cabinet and the successor to the Minister of the Imperial Household is extremely urgent. At this time when the situation is complex and serious, it is still questionable whether the issue of the successor prime minister can be resolved quickly. In terms of objective circumstances, it is not easy to find a suitable person for the position of successor prime minister, and there seem to be quite a few twists and turns. As for the selection of the successor to the Minister of the Imperial Household, whether it will be decided before the formation of the cabinet is also related to the issue of the successor prime minister, so no decision has been made yet. The future is quite worthy of attention. (A dispatch from the Allied News Agency on the 1st)</p>
<p>Okitsu: Regarding the issue of the successor cabinet, senior officials are studying it. It is heard that Prince Saionji will come to Kyoto on the 2nd to reply to the questions. (A dispatch from the Allied News Agency on the 1st)</p>
<p>With the Tokyo incident resolved and the overall situation trending towards calm, the selection of the successor cabinet and the successor to the Minister of the Imperial Household is being carefully studied by elder statesmen and senior officials. It is believed that the duties of the Minister of the Imperial Household are important in assisting the Emperor in peacetime, and a decision should be made quickly. Currently, Prince Saionji and Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa are discussing whether to invite a member of the imperial family to succeed to this position. This opinion seems to be quite powerful. As for the successor cabinet, Prince Saionji will reply to the questions and plans to listen to the opinions of senior officials, carefully consider the changes in the situation, and elect someone with popular support to organize a cooperative cabinet of national unity. The following figures are about to be nominated:</p>
<p>Baron Tatsuo Yamamoto, Count Keigo Kiyoura, Kurahei Yuasa, Baron Kiichiro Hiranuma, Duke Fumimaro Konoe, General Misao Kawai.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned people, there are some rumors that General Eisuke Yamamoto and Baron Reijiro Wakatsuki also have news of forming a cabinet. (A dispatch from the Allied News Agency on the 1st)</p>

The riots were suppressed with the power of the Imperial Army. This is thanks to relying on the Emperor's power that we have today. However, the general public has been able to remain calm, and the economic community has not lost its normal state. This is a great fortune in the misfortune of the country. Now that the incident has subsided, both the government and the public should refrain from rashness, respect restraint, and fulfill their duties as citizens with integrity and moderation.

<p>Washington - Ambassador Saito of Japan delivered a broadcast speech last night, stating that the Tokyo incident would absolutely not disrupt the peace of the Pacific. He also denounced warmongers as a scourge of the nation, saying that if the Japanese government were indeed controlled by such individuals, it would be a great disaster for Japan. However, he asserted that the majority of military personnel do not harbor bellicose intentions, thus soldiers are beneficial to the country, but warmongers are detrimental. Japan's domestic and foreign policies will not change due to recent events. However, politicians bearing governmental responsibility will be even more dedicated to serving the country and will strive for extra caution to clarify the political situation. He concluded that although the incident was unfortunate, the rebels acted out of sincere patriotism, and it is regrettable that they were misled. Their motives seem to stem from fear that the government is controlled by financial cliques, leading to corruption, a mistaken notion not unique to Japanese youth, but also present in many other countries.

<p>Paris - According to General Niesessel, a well-known French military expert, of the 2,800 aircraft, 70 squadrons are fighter planes and 80 squadrons are reconnaissance planes, totaling 1,400. General Niesessel stated that of these 2,800 aircraft, 600 are stationed in the Far East, leaving only 2,200 to cope with the situation in Europe. In the event of war, only fighter planes could be used in an emergency. The Soviet Union has approximately 500 fighter planes stationed in the Far East, and those in Europe can only fly within 6,000 miles, making them ineffective for targets in Poland, which is 5,000 miles away. General Niesessel also stated that the long-promoted Soviet paratrooper operations are nothing more than exaggeration. According to foreign experts who have witnessed their performances, they are completely useless behind enemy lines.

<p>Moscow/Kulun News - On February 25th, the Foreign Minister of "Manchukuo" sent a memorandum to the Mongolian Premier and Foreign Minister Genden, raising the issue of the border between the two countries. In this memorandum, the "Manchukuo Government" accused Mongolian troops of continuously attacking "Manchukuo" territory south of Lake Bel, plundering the peaceful people and cattle in that area. At the same time, the "Manchukuo Government" protested the incident of February 12th, regarding which the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic had already announced the details in a protest to the "Manchukuo Government" on February 13th.</p>
<p>To rationalize this delayed protest, the "Manchukuo Government" claimed that the February 12th incident was the result of the Mongolian authorities illegally occupying Ulan Khuduk, a place allegedly belonging to "Manchukuo." The "Manchukuo Government" demanded that Mongolian troops immediately withdraw from this "forcibly occupied" territory and that similar incidents not occur again, otherwise, it would reserve the right to take free action.</p>
<p>At the same time, the "Manchukuo Government" continued to mention the necessity of establishing diplomatic relations and seeking peaceful resolutions to border disputes, claiming that the Mongolian proposal to organize a border committee was impractical. The "Manchukuo Government" declared that if Mongolia could propose a more effective and appropriate method, it would be willing to sincerely, impartially, and cooperatively discuss such a proposal. The Foreign Minister of "Manchukuo" requested to be informed of the views of the Mongolian People's Republic in the near future.</p>
<p>Outer Mongolia Responds - In response to this memorandum, the Mongolian Foreign Minister sent the following memorandum today: "I believe it is necessary to reiterate that the entire course of the conflict that occurred in Bulantsen, within the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic on February 12th, has been described in detail and accurately in my protest of February 13th, which unfortunately did not receive a response. I deeply regret that you have failed to meet our legitimate demands made in that protest, and instead, in your protest, you declare us to be illegal and demand that we withdraw from the "Manchukuo" territory allegedly occupied by our troops. The Government of the Mongolian Republic reiterates that our troops have never invaded the "Manchukuo" border, nor have they occupied its territory or plundered its peaceful people and cattle, and that all these incidents in fact occurred within the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic, as a result of your country's troops invading our border and attacking our border guards. The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic is deeply willing to maintain peaceful relations with all its neighbors and is prepared to make every effort to maintain peace and tranquility on its borders. The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic believes that such conflicts cannot be resolved due to the opposing interpretations of the events by both sides. In order to ascertain the truth, the Mongolian government proposes to immediately organize a mixed Manchu-Mongolian committee to investigate and report on the entire circumstances and causes of the February 12th incident, as well as other incidents that have occurred, providing reasons for mutual accusations. This committee will also be instructed to propose various methods to prevent similar conflicts from occurring in the future. If your country agrees, the Government of the Mongolian Republic is willing to immediately appoint representatives to participate in the mixed committee. The Government of the Mongolian Republic hopes that the "Manchukuo" government will fulfill the promise made in the February 25th memorandum, that is, to consider this proposal in a cooperative spirit and without bias, and to provide a satisfactory response promptly."

<p>Rome - The strongest two Ethiopian armies on the northern front are in danger of being destroyed as a result of the Italian Third Army and the Eritrean Second Regiment's encirclement of the Tembien salient. According to Italian sources, the army led by Ethiopian Generals Kassa and Seyoum is now trapped in a pincer movement by Italian columns, facing either surrender or annihilation. The Ethiopian army realized yesterday that it was in a precarious situation and attempted to break through the Zemian Mountains, but the road was blocked by the Italian Third Army. According to a battle report from General Badoglio, commander of the Italian East African forces, the predicament of the two Ethiopian armies is worsening. The second major battle, which began at dawn on February 28th in the Tembien area, has reached its concluding phase. At the same time, the 9,000-foot-high Amba Aradam, considered the gateway to Ethiopia, has apparently been occupied by Italian troops without bloodshed. The entire nation of Italy rejoices. Mussolini has ordered flags to be flown everywhere on Sunday to celebrate. It is felt that this decisive victory will determine the outcome of the Ethiopian war, with Italy certain to prevail. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Rome - Today marks the 40th anniversary of the defeat of Italian troops at the Battle of Adwa in Ethiopia. Coincidentally, after the soldiers on the front lines occupied the strategically important Emba Aradam mountain in northern Ethiopia, 150,000 people gathered in front of the Palazzo Venezia for a memorial ceremony, which was very enthusiastic. Mussolini, dressed in military uniform, delivered a speech, stating, "The front-line soldiers' occupation of Emba Aradam is both a redemption of shame and a demonstration of glory. How do you feel, everyone? I know very well. This victory must be attributed to the unyielding spirit of the Fascist revolution. When the front-line soldiers establish extraordinary achievements and move forward bravely, why should I add more words?" The crowd cheered thunderously. King Emmanuel III and Prime Minister Mussolini also participated in a memorial ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier beforehand, and the crowd cheered for the King and Prime Minister. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Italian Troops Advance Swiftly</p>
<p>Rome - According to semi-official sources from Asmara today, the Ethiopian northern army in this decisive battle has been completely defeated and almost annihilated by Saturday evening. Informed sources here are widely reporting that General Kassa has been killed in action, and General Seyoum has surrendered after being surrounded in the Tembien area. The Italian "February 1st" Division has crossed the Tagaze River southwest of Adwa, annihilated the enemy forces attempting to resist there, and is advancing bravely, expected to reach the border of Gondar province in the near future. This morning, General Badoglio telegraphed that "the second decisive battle in the Tembien area has reached its final stage. The positions of the troops under Generals Kassa and Seyoum have been surrounded by our forces and are in imminent danger." Government communiqués indicate that the Italian northern army is now advancing in two directions, hoping to complete the campaign before the rainy season begins. A unit of Eritrean native troops has also been deployed to the Danakil Desert in order to attack Lake Asale from the west, while simultaneously pressing from the north. If successful, Italian forces will be able to control the entire northern region of Ethiopia without encroaching on the Lake Tana area, which would affect British interests in the source of the Nile. (Guomin News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>Fierce Battle in the Tembien Area; General Kassa's Forces in Complete Disarray</p>
<p>Rome - General Badoglio, High Commissioner of Italian East Africa and Commander of the Expeditionary Force, recently released Communiqué No. 142, stating, "The Italian Northern Army recently engaged the forces under Ethiopian General Kassa in the Tembien area. The Ethiopian army suffered heavy losses and is now in complete disarray." It is rumored that General Kassa committed suicide after this defeat. It is also reported that the victorious Italian troops were from the Third Army, which attacked the Ethiopian army at Enda Nolli on the night of February 27th and 28th and defeated them after a fierce battle. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Tigray Front - The Italian Third Army in the north achieved the following victory in the Tembien area yesterday. The Third Army attacked the positions held by Ethiopian General Kassa from the south. First, specialized infantry (mostly mountain troops and Blackshirts) climbed Mount Emba Ulok on the night of February 26th and 27th, killing its defenders. Although the Ethiopian army tried to retake the summit, it was unsuccessful. Its main force retreated to the rear, while leaving some troops stationed in the Abiy Addi area for cover. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Tigray Front - This newspaper's reporter Bartol reports that after the fierce battle between the Italian and Ethiopian armies in the Tembien area yesterday, the number of casualties on both sides was not small. The Ethiopian army suffered 3,000 deaths, while the Italian army suffered 489 deaths. The Italian left wing continues to press towards the Ethiopian army. The Ethiopian army is no longer putting up strong resistance. The Italian army is advancing towards Lake Ashangi. With the Ethiopian northern army now in disarray, the only reinforcements are the Ethiopian Emperor's guards, but it is generally believed that even if the Emperor personally leads the guards to the front lines, it may be too late. The Italian northern army has practically achieved a final military victory. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Cutting Off Ethiopian Army Communications</p>
<p>Rome - General Badoglio, High Commissioner of Italian East Africa and Commander of the Expeditionary Force, recently issued a war communiqué stating that the Italian Northern Army is now re-engaged with the forces under Ethiopian Generals Kassa and Seyoum in the Tembien area. The Ethiopian army has been surrounded and is in a dangerous situation. According to information received here from the front lines, the Italian Northern Army's front lines extend from Dongollo Kesahai in the east to the Tekeze River in the west, and the situation is very secure. The desert area of Dongollo Kesahai is barren and difficult to traverse even for native Ethiopians, while the banks of the Tekeze River are steep and rugged, making it a natural barrier that is difficult to attack. At this point, the Italian army is gradually advancing south, and the Ethiopian army in the Tembien and Shidho areas is being contained, preventing it from communicating with other troops on the Tigray front.

<h3 id="e53">US President Approves; Neutrality Act Extension; Prohibits Loans to Belligerents; New Concrete Step to Maintain Neutrality <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Washington - The US President today approved the bill passed by both houses of Congress last week to extend the Neutrality Act to May 1, 1937. This plan aims to ensure US neutrality in the event of a war in Europe, prohibits lending to belligerents, and enables the President to declare a ban on the shipment of arms and ammunition to belligerents and to prohibit US travelers from traveling on belligerent ships in the event of war. No warships belonging to belligerents are allowed to enter US ports. According to a statement issued by President Roosevelt, the new Neutrality Act's prohibition of lending to belligerents is a new and concrete step towards maintaining US neutrality. Under the original law, the shipment of arms to both Italy and Ethiopia was prohibited. He also stated that he has now issued a new proclamation to meet the needs of the new law and that the neutrality policy initially announced by him and Secretary of State Hull will remain effective. President Roosevelt concluded by asking that trade with belligerents be limited to no more than peacetime levels. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt has signed the new Neutrality Act, extending the existing Neutrality Act's term of validity by 14 months, that is, until May 1, 1937. The various clauses contained in the existing Neutrality Act, whether temporary or permanent in nature, are preserved and supplemented with new clauses, which are explained separately below:</p>
<p>Temporary Clauses: The export of arms is prohibited to belligerents or neutral countries acting on behalf of belligerents. This clause remains in effect.</p>
<p>Permanent Clauses: Stipulate that (A) merchants manufacturing and selling arms must apply for registration; (B) foreign submarines may not use US seaports as a base; (C) the President may, at his discretion, prohibit US citizens from boarding armed merchant ships of belligerents. These clauses remain in effect.</p>
<p>New Clauses: (A) Prohibits long-term and short-term loans to belligerents, but the President may approve short-term loans of a commercial nature to belligerents, as is customary; (B) The arms embargo does not apply to Latin American countries if they are attacked by countries outside of the Americas. However, the arms embargo will still apply if Latin American countries form an alliance with countries outside of the Americas during a war in the Western Hemisphere. (Havas, 29th)</p>

<p>London - Former Prime Minister Lloyd George, leader of the opposition Liberal Party, recently gave a speech on the issue of British national defense, stating, "The Liberal Party will study the government's white paper on rearmament (scheduled to be released next Wednesday)." He also stated, "The government's proposed approach, advocating that Britain's air force be on par with the air force of the most powerful country, is not sufficient to guarantee our country's security. The only hope for avoiding air warfare is to make it clear to all future aggressors that if our country is attacked, not only will our country rise up in self-defense, but also the power of the entire League of Nations will come to our aid. This force is unbreakable and cannot be defended against by any country in the world. Therefore, for Britain's sake, it should not isolate itself, but must cooperate with the League of Nations. This is why our party fully accepts the policy adopted by the League of Nations without reservation." (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>London - According to information from this newspaper's reporter, naval circles in Britain are now extremely concerned about the eastern coast being close to the continent, making it vulnerable to enemy attacks in the event of a conflict. Conservative MP Sir Sothern mentioned this on the 13th of this month in the House of Commons, stating, "If the enemy launches aerial bombardments, the southeastern ports will bear the brunt, and they should be strictly defended." In light of this, naval circles have planned to build multiple anti-aircraft stations along the eastern coast, equipped with aircraft detection devices, so that the location of enemy aircraft formations can be detected upon hearing their approach. On the other hand, the western coast is not only farther from the continent, but even if enemy aircraft were to cross the border, the rumbling of their engines would be heard before they reached their destination, making it less vulnerable to enemy attacks. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>London - The government plans to add a Minister without Portfolio who will be specifically responsible for coordinating national defense affairs. This newspaper's reporter has learned that one of the main tasks of this minister will be to reconcile the views of the Navy and the Air Force. The Navy believes that although air attacks are to be feared, they will not endanger the Navy. Therefore, it advocates that the rearmament plan should focus on the Navy. The Air Force, on the other hand, believes that in future wars, the Air Force will be able to decisively defeat battleships, and therefore demands that air force armaments be expanded with all resources. With these two opposing views, there is a need for reconciliation. (Havas, 29th)</p>

<p>London - Regarding the issue of Britain and Germany concluding a separate naval agreement outside of the Naval Conference, German Chancellor Hitler has authorized the German Ambassador to the UK, Herr von Hoesch, to begin negotiations with the British government in order to establish a bilateral qualitative restriction agreement to supplement the agreement concluded last June. It is expected that Ambassador von Hoesch will notify the British government of these instructions tomorrow. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>London - German Chancellor Hitler has agreed to begin negotiations in London to conclude a bilateral naval qualitative restriction treaty between Britain and Germany to supplement the existing naval quantitative restriction treaty between the two countries. The German Embassy in London has received these instructions in response to the proposal made by British Foreign Secretary Eden to the German Ambassador to the UK, Dr. Hoesch, that if the London Naval Conference can conclude a naval treaty, Britain and Germany should sign a bilateral treaty identical to that treaty. This procedure was initially proposed by France to dispel French objections to signing a comprehensive treaty including Germany, thereby avoiding the appearance of undermining the Treaty of Versailles. The only difference between this procedure and a comprehensive treaty including Germany is that, under the bilateral treaty, Germany will only notify Britain of its shipbuilding program, and Germany will only receive Britain's shipbuilding program, and not those of all the signatory countries.

<p>Paris - Three French young explorers have formed an expedition team and will soon depart from here to explore the upper reaches of the Amazon River in South America. The team leader, Florene, is an experienced explorer who previously ventured deep into the Amazon River basin and is familiar with the customs and conditions there. He recently gave a speech here, explaining the purpose of this trip and detailing the history of Amazon exploration, from beginning to end, without omission. He stated that the team's planned route is to disembark at a port on the Pacific Ocean, then travel by small boat through the wilderness, down the Mapo River, and then up the Amazon River to the great waterfall near the Santiago River. Above that point is the territory of the uncivilized Jivaro people. The exploration will begin there. The purpose of our exploration is to investigate the geography and geology of the area, and to study the indigenous peoples and their customs. As far as I know, the vast forests of central South America have never been developed. The inhabitants are all savage tribes, and the Jivaro are the fiercest and most difficult to approach. Their hatred of civilization is also the greatest. In the early 17th century, when the Spanish invaded their territory from Peru, they established five cities for Spanish residents, but all were destroyed by the Jivaro, and over five thousand Spanish residents were killed. Afterwards, this area returned to its original state. These people live in the forests, dwell in tribes, and always carry weapons with them. They do not associate with white or red people. They destroy any small paths in the forest that could lead to their homes. Fighting is commonplace. Grudges often accumulate between clans, leading to tribal warfare. The victors not only cut off the heads of the defeated for pleasure, but they also carefully preserve these heads, making them into dried wax. The method is to first dig out all the bones and flesh from the skull, and then fill it with hot stones. The outer muscles contract when heated, so a large skull shrinks to the size of an apple after this process. However, the face of the deceased, including the beard and eyebrows, is fully visible and does not change. This type of dried wax is called a "Tsantsas." Any adult man who does not have a Tsantsas cannot marry for life. This custom is truly cruel. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>London - The London Chinese Art Exhibition at Burlington House is about to close (March 3rd). As a result, the number of visitors has increased in recent days. Yesterday, there were 12,700 visitors, exceeding the record for daily attendance at the Royal Academy of Arts. After thirteen weeks, the exhibition has received a total of 307,000 visitors. It is expected that the total number of 340,000 visitors to the French Exhibition will easily be surpassed. After the exhibition closes, packing and storage will begin immediately, working day and night, as the treasures must be returned to their original owners around the world within just three weeks. It is expected that they will not be transported back to China by British cruisers. However, they will certainly be escorted by warships. Some American enthusiasts wanted to transport the treasures to New York for exhibition, but this was not successful because the U.S. government could not provide the necessary naval transport ships.

<p>19. Cotton Industry of Jinghui Canal in Shaanxi</p>
<p>The Shaanxi Provincial Construction Department has been working on the testing, domestication, and breeding of seedless cotton for a long time, and the results are satisfactory. The department has promoted the establishment of Yanghua Production and Sales Cooperatives in the Jinghui Canal area of the province. The scope of the cooperative extends from Yongle Town in Jingyang in the west to Gaofeng Village in Gaoling County in the east, bounded by the Zhongbai Canal in the north and the border between Yongle Town and Houzitou in the south. The area is ten li long from east to west and five li from north to south. Ten villages within this area have joined the cooperative, half belonging to Jingyang and half to Gaoling. The cotton planted is pure seedless cotton, with long fibers and a clean color. The planting is regulated with row spacing of two and a half feet and plant spacing of one foot. Adjustments can be made based on soil fertility. The total cotton field area is over 4,452 mu, yielding over 110,000 jin of ginned cotton. Each time the cotton is harvested, the cooperative divides the cotton into grades, inspects for dryness and warmth, weighs it, and examines it for purity. Then, it is weighed and registered, and a cotton receipt is issued to decide whether to transport the cotton directly for sale outside the area, in order to avoid exploitation by cotton merchants and to receive government tax exemptions and transportation subsidies. The cotton is transported by a transportation company from the origin to Jiaokou, then loaded onto ships at Jiaokou and transported to Tongguan. The average freight cost for each dan (two bales) of cotton is four yuan and fifty cents. From Tongguan, it is loaded onto trains and transported to Shanghai. The freight cost for each dan (100 jin) is two yuan and seventy cents. After the cotton is transported to Shanghai, the average price is over forty yuan per dan (100 jin). However, superior cotton is often classified as inferior and cannot be sold outside the area, and must be sold to nearby cotton shops at a low price. This is the business situation of the Yongle District Guaranteed Liability Cotton Production and Sales Cooperative in the Jinghui Canal.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Overseas Chinese After the Establishment of Consulate in Vietnam <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Hanoi Correspondence - Consul Xu and Consul Zhong Strive for Equal Treatment, All Overseas Chinese Express Their Support</p>
<p>There are 500,000 of our compatriots living in Vietnam, over 400,000 in Saigon and the six provinces of Cambodia, and over 40,000 in Tonkin, all engaged in industry and commerce (especially workers). Due to our country's weakness, diplomacy has been virtually non-existent. Therefore, overseas Chinese are governed by the French as equals with the Vietnamese, and the legal treatment they receive is sometimes not even as good as that of the Vietnamese. Those who have lived in or passed through Vietnam for a long time are well aware of this. After lengthy discussions between the Chinese diplomatic authorities, the Sino-Vietnamese Treaty was renewed last year, and our country began to send Consuls to Saigon and Hanoi in accordance with the Treaty. From then on, overseas Chinese in Vietnam were able to see the dignity of Chinese officials. This is why overseas Chinese in Vietnam were overjoyed. When Consul-General Xu Nianceng and Consul Zhong Zhenjun arrived in Hanoi via Haiphong, tens of thousands of overseas Chinese lined the streets to welcome them. When the consulate was opened, overseas Chinese from thousands of miles away rushed to participate, recalling the past and weeping bitterly. Because overseas Chinese are far from their homeland and have suffered greatly from unequal treatment, they are filled with a deep longing for their homeland, and their joy turns to sorrow.</p>
<p>Most of the overseas Chinese in Vietnam are Cantonese, with the Fujianese accounting for 20%. Recently, due to the economic downturn, the number of overseas Chinese has gradually decreased. Even in Haiphong, the population has decreased from 15,000 to over 9,000. As for overseas Chinese education, except for the children of merchants with considerable assets, there are few opportunities for education, and education is subject to much interference from the French, making it impossible to develop. Therefore, the knowledge of the overseas Chinese community is extremely low, which is a source of worry for knowledgeable overseas Chinese, but there is nothing they can do. This is why the overseas Chinese in Vietnam have a particularly strong concern for their homeland and participate in aiding the revolution particularly actively. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution in South China relied on Haiphong as a base, as it had the economic support of the overseas Chinese in Vietnam.</p>
<p>The French have always implemented a "Bang" system to govern overseas Chinese. The "Bangs" are divided by province, or even by prefecture or language. The French allow each "Bang" to elect a "Bang" leader to represent the overseas Chinese. However, this "representation" only represents the French in collecting taxes from the overseas Chinese to facilitate their control. The French policy is designed to divide the overseas Chinese. Therefore, ignorant overseas Chinese never think about uniting, and factions are often divided and disagree. Among the "Bang" leaders, there are some enthusiastic people with a deep sense of justice who care about the dignity of the country, but there are also many greedy and ignorant people who are willing to be used by foreigners to exploit their compatriots. This unfortunate situation has lasted for decades without change. Since the establishment of the consulate, they have unanimously expressed their support under the idea of the nation, and handed over the command of the overseas Chinese to the consulate. This must be regarded as a fortunate event for the overseas Chinese. However, the French authorities in Vietnam believe that this is detrimental to their ruling power and refuse to abolish it. Consul Xu and Consul Zhong have argued on the basis of reason, and this matter is still in progress. The reporter met with Consul Zhong yesterday and asked about this matter. Consul Zhong said that he is continuing negotiations and will never fail to live up to the expectations of the government and the overseas Chinese, and is willing to make any sacrifices. The reporter shook hands with him respectfully to express his gratitude.</p>
<p>The consulate was established on December 18th last year. The work of the consulate is quite busy. The French have a very harsh "Overpass Permit Tax" for overseas Chinese. This permit, which overseas Chinese call "Humanity Paper" (used for traveling within Vietnam), must be renewed every fifteen days, and each renewal costs one Vietnamese dollar. As a result of negotiations, the French authorities have ordered its cancellation. According to Consul Zhong, negotiations are underway regarding the legal status of overseas Chinese, with the aim of obtaining the same treatment as British, American, and Japanese overseas residents. This move has gained the sincere sympathy of the overseas Chinese. In short, the overseas Chinese, who have suffered greatly, have had their eyes and ears refreshed since the opening of the consulate. (February 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Secret Organization Discovered in Anhai, Quanzhou <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Two Key Criminals Captured by Garrison Troops, Zhang Xiongnan Also Said to Have Been Used for Information</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: In recent months, there have been many rumors in Xiamen and southern Fujian. According to a public announcement in Quanzhou on the 28th, in recent months, Japanese ronin have infiltrated the counties of Jinjiang, Nan'an, Hui'an, and Yongchun, evading taxes to smuggle goods, selling military supplies, colluding with unscrupulous merchants and traitors, either organizing smuggling agencies or secretly forming parties, and engaging in all kinds of illegal activities. On the night of the 23rd, troops stationed in Quanzhou cracked down on a large-scale smuggling agency in Shishi. On the night of the 26th, the garrison troops of the 52nd Regiment of the 9th Division in Anhai also cracked down on an organization called the "Youth Righteous Knights General Alliance" in Jinglin Township and captured two key criminals. Earlier, Zhu Xietuan, Battalion Commander of the 52nd Regiment of the 9th Division stationed in Anhai, received a report stating that suspicious foreigners were active in the market towns and villages under the jurisdiction of the Second District. He immediately sent his adjutant, Li Yuanchen, with thirty soldiers and two policemen from the Second District as guides, and rushed there on the evening of the 26th. When they approached Jinglin Township, they saw flickering lights and loud voices, as if they were aware of something. After a while, the troops were surrounded by the crowd in the dark. Li ordered platoon leader Duan Zigui to lead several soldiers to break through bravely and chase the bandits into a house. They fought fiercely with the bandits for several minutes. Duan was shot in the right chest and could not hold on. Then the troops rushed to surround the house, fought hand-to-hand and entered the house, capturing two people. One was Xu Xi, over 20 years old, who was seriously injured with a gunshot wound in his left leg, and the other was Su Lun, also over 20 years old. Both were dressed in black. A symbol with the number 0023 was found on Xu, with the words "Leader of the Youth Righteous Knights General Alliance." A pistol, 61 bullets, 3 hand grenades, and 7 ledgers of selling firearms and bullets were also found in the house. It was already 3:00 AM on the morning of the 27th. They were taken to Quanzhou for interrogation. Xu could not speak because of two bullets in his left leg. They arrived in Quanzhou on the evening of the 27th. After Su Lun was interrogated by the 52nd Regiment headquarters, he confessed that Xu Xi was selling firearms. He was then transferred to the Third District Pacification Headquarters. Xu died in a rickshaw on the way to Dongjie. Su was imprisoned and will continue to be interrogated.</p>
<p>Rumors have been rife in recent days in Nan'an Wharf and Yongchun that Chen Weijin has secretly returned to the wharf and has entered Dehua to conspire with the remnants of Zhang Xiongnan's troops (Zhang's troops recently defected during the re-enrollment). It is also said that Chen had discussed matters with Zhang in a certain place before returning (Chen fled last year and both lived in the capital of a certain country, Zhang recently returned to Hong Kong). Zhang Chengfu's troops of over 300 men under Zhang are now in the Annan Yongde border area, wantonly killing and looting for supplies. The 26th Brigade of the 9th Division is suppressing them under the personal command of Brigade Commander Xie Fu. According to a public announcement by the Quanzhou Pacification Department on the 28th, the bandits have suffered over 100 deaths. It is also reported that the bandits are showing signs of fleeing to the Xianyou border. The 9th Division has ordered the 49th Regiment in Xianyou to intercept them. Also, the bandit troops of Zhang Kewu have recently fled to Yunxi. It has been verified that Zhang Kewu's troops are also under Zhang Xiongnan. (March 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e85">New Regulations for Overseas Chinese Entering Nanyang <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>New Special and Harsh Regulations Intended to Restrict Overseas Chinese Entry</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Most of the overseas Chinese in the British, Dutch, French, and American territories of the Nanyang Islands are from southern Fujian. Every year, overseas Chinese from various territories of Nanyang returning to Fujian and those leaving Fujian for overseas use Xiamen as a port of departure and arrival. Therefore, there are over 80 ships sailing between Xiamen and various ports in Nanyang, the largest being 10,000 tons and the smallest 4,000 tons. On average, 7,000 people leave each month, and the number of arrivals is sometimes equal, but mostly exceeds the number of departures. Among them, the most go to the Dutch territories, followed by the British territories. However, the British, Dutch, American, and French territories have extremely strict restrictions on the entry of overseas Chinese. The Dutch and American territories are particularly strict. Recently, the Dutch territories have issued new regulations. Any overseas Chinese traveling with family members to Dairi, Batavia, Surabaya, Semarang, Julang, Kota, Sumatra, Bandung, and Wending in the Dutch territories must carry a marriage certificate and a certificate from the local Baojia chief, stamped by the county government, before they are allowed to go ashore. They must also pay 150 Dutch guilders per person to the local government as a guarantee deposit. If the investigation proves true, it can be returned within six months; otherwise, it will be confiscated and they will be deported. If the husband is in the Dutch territories and the wife is going there, or if they are taking their children with them, they must also pay 150 Dutch guilders per person and submit a marriage certificate. It has been verified that many overseas residents have been repatriated or deported due to incomplete procedures because they were not aware of the above new regulations. Also, the American Philippines has recently banned the entry of new overseas Chinese. Only old overseas Chinese who have a residence permit (commonly known as "Big Character") in the Philippines and are returning from their home country are allowed to return. If the old overseas Chinese own a store as the owner, their wives, mothers, and children may be granted entry permits. If they are workers, their families are not allowed. New immigrants must have a guarantee deposit of 1,000 US dollars, and a residence permit fee of 10 US dollars. Old overseas Chinese must pay an import tax of 8 US dollars and a residence permit fee of 10 US dollars. Also, the Dutch landing fee of 150 Dutch guilders (equivalent to 339 national currency) can be refunded if they leave the country within six months; otherwise, it will not be returned. The British Malaya import tax is 5 Singapore dollars (equivalent to 9.6 national currency), which can be refunded if they reside within one week. French Vietnam requires a head tax of 35 Annamese dollars (equivalent to 77 national currency), which cannot be refunded. Siam has an import license fee of 100 baht, a residence fee of 15 baht, and there are also unnamed national customs fees. It can be refunded if they leave the country within one year. As for the outbound ship ticket prices, taking third class as an example, it is 80 yuan to British Singapore, 90 yuan to Rangoon, 40 yuan to the American Philippines, and 66 yuan to Dutch Surabaya, and 81 yuan to Sabang. Also, the national passport fee issued by the Public Security Bureau is 4.6 yuan, and the signing fee at the Xiamen Consulate of the British, Dutch, and French territories is 12 yuan, and 4 yuan to Japan. Based on the above expenses, a single overseas Chinese cannot depart without substantial capital. The governments of the various Nanyang territories, in addition to using complicated legal procedures to make overseas Chinese fearful, also impose such heavy financial burdens, restricting them economically. The purpose is to restrict the entry of overseas Chinese. In fact, overseas Chinese will continue to go abroad as long as the Nanyang economy improves slightly, shoulder to shoulder, because the Fujian economy is declining and there is no employment to be found, so they have no choice but to go abroad to find new opportunities.

<h3 id="e86">Rampant Bandits on the Fujian-Guangdong Border —Guangdong Army Deploys Troops to Vigorously Suppress— <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Since the Chaozhou-Meizhou garrison made efforts last year to clear the countryside, implement Baojia (community policing), and suppress remaining bandits, the remnants in Raoping Phoenix Mountain, Chaoyang Nanshan, Fengshun Baxiang Mountain, Jieyang Beishan, Chao'an Sangpu Mountain, Chenghai Qinglan Cave, and other places have been completely unable to gain a foothold. Consequently, they have fled into the major mountains on the Fujian-Guangdong border, such as Pinghe Xianghu Mountain, Zhao'an Shangxiazhai, Lianhua Mountain, Yongding Yuantou Mountain, and other locations, which have become their final lairs. In places like Zhao'an Si Du, no fewer than twenty or thirty Baojia chiefs, grain collectors, and public officials in charge of donations have been oppressed and killed by bandits. No fewer than two or three hundred innocent people have been kidnapped and ransomed. Fifty or sixty have been robbed and killed. It is reported that the bandits operate in groups of thirty to fifty, openly setting fire to villages and towns during the day. As a result, villages like Taiping, Qicai, and Chezai Xu have been looted and burned, with more than ten villages being completely destroyed. The main force of the bandits is entrenched in several places, including Beizhe and Pingshui. The bandit leader, surnamed Zhou, is from Qiongshan County, Guangdong Province. He previously occupied the Sanping small mountain town area on the border of Nan靖, Hexi, and Zhangpu counties. Around July of last year, Zhou, acting on a false order, sneaked into Chizhu坪 in Zhao'an County, gathering the remnants of Yu Dingen, Yu Qitou, and Yu Hongmao from Raoping Phoenix Mountain. He proclaimed himself the "Political Commissar of the Red Army of Pseudo-Zhao (Zhao'an), Yun (Yunxiao), and He (Pinghe)," and reorganized the bandit gangs into the "Pseudo-Zhao'an Battalion," "Pinghe Battalion," and "Yunxiao Battalion." Because the terrain of Chizhu坪 was not as dangerous as that of Pingshui, in October, he moved the pseudo-general headquarters to Pingshui, specializing in harassing the Guangdong border. Later, the Guangdong Army's Zeng Youren Brigade stationed in Raoping County advanced to suppress Shangxiazhai. The bandit leader Yu Dingen was shot and killed. Zhou then appointed Chen Tingxiong as the pseudo-Yunxiao battalion commander, reorganizing the three hundred-odd bandits into a basic bandit army and forcing the villagers in the Beizhe and Pingshui areas to join the bandit party. Those who refused were robbed and killed. The bandit gangs of Yu Qitou and Yu Hongmao (who died on the Fen Shuiguan Ridge) are mostly composed of villagers from Raoping and Huanggang counties. They are now looting and kidnapping in Baxian, forty or fifty li away from Huanggang County. The Yu Qitou bandits are particularly fierce, having fought against the suppressing army several times. According to investigation, the strength of these gangs is as follows: Chen Tingxiong's command has 240 rifles, 4 submachine guns, 1 automatic rifle, and 26 Mauser pistols. Yu Qitou's command has 180 rifles and 24 Mauser pistols. However, both bandit gangs are severely short of ammunition. The Huang Renhuan Division stationed in Meixian is now additionally deploying the Chen Shuyiao Regiment to Dapu, to work with the Zeng Dayu, Chen Shaowu, and Ye Weihao regiments to strictly defend the Rao-Pu border. East Zone Commissioner Li Hanhun will inspect the Chaozhou-Meizhou-Fujian-Jiangxi border after Chief of Staff Li Yukun returns to Shantou from the province, to ensure vigorous suppression. (24th)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Overview of the Capital Telephone Bureau <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Total of Four Branches and 7,300 Numbers Installed</p>
<p>Nanjing Communication: Automatic telephones in Nanjing began in July of the 19th year of the Republic. Appropriately after the establishment of the capital, government agencies were set up everywhere, and commerce flourished, leading to a sharp increase in users. At that time, the main bureau installed 3,000 numbers, the Gulou branch 1,000 numbers, and the Xiaguan branch 1,000 numbers, for a total of 5,000 numbers. By the 23rd year of the Republic, the capacity was full. It was decided that year, with the approval of the Ministry of Communications, to establish the South Branch in the old Jiangning County government office in the south of the city, adding 1,800 numbers. The North Branch (Gulou) was also expanded by 500 numbers at the same time, for a total of 7,300 numbers. It was originally scheduled to be operational last winter, but due to delays in delivery by the automatic telephone company, the new equipment for the North and South branches was only installed and put into operation last month. According to the person in charge of the bureau, the new equipment can temporarily cope with new users. In addition, the bureau has also established a branch in Shushan Town (the new site of the Jiangning County government), installing a 50-line magneto-type small exchange switchboard, which has already started construction and will soon be completed.</p>
<p>In terms of long-distance telephones, the Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Wuhu, Shanghai-Hangzhou, Bengbu, and Jiangbei lines operated by the ministry have long been connected. In addition, long-distance telephone lines operated by Jiangsu Province in Jiangning, Jurong, Lishui, Liyang, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Wujin, Yutan, Yixing, and other nine counties, as well as long-distance telephone lines operated by Zhejiang Province, can all be connected. Furthermore, long-distance telephone lines to Ping, Tianjin, Hunan, Hubei, Shandong, Jiangxi, and other provinces operated by the ministry will also be connected soon. As for the rest of Jiangsu Province, with the exception of the nine counties mentioned above, most other counties have already installed long-distance telephone lines. Because these are managed by the Provincial Department of Construction, they conflict with those managed by the ministry, forming a kind of opposition within the same system. Whether from the perspective of the business itself or the organizational system, it is extremely uneconomical and unreasonable, and it seems necessary to adjust it.</p>
<p>The telephone machinery room is located on the third floor of the bureau and is divided into six parts: the first and second line switches, the first to third selectors, and the terminator. The first line switch has 50 numbers as a group. Among these 50 numbers, only 10 can be connected at the same time. The second line switch has 60 numbers as a group, and 10 can be connected at the same time. When we dial the dial, we often hear a buzzing sound (busy signal), which indicates that someone is already on the line. The first selector has ten grids in both vertical and horizontal directions, and jumps according to the number we dial. For example, if we dial the number 4, it will jump vertically to the fourth grid, and then horizontally to the empty switch, connecting the second and third selectors. If the horizontal jump is in the eighth grid, it means that the first seven lines have already been occupied. Each selector only manages one number. Finally, the terminator specializes in managing the last two numbers. Usually, when we call a telephone, we must go through these six parts, from the first line switch to the terminator, relying on the operation of the machine, without manual labor, being able to automatically connect. It is truly an extremely ingenious thing.</p>
<p>The first digit of the telephone number represents the area. The "2" prefix belongs to the city center, where the main bureau is located. The Gulou area in the north of the city is "3," Xiaguan is "4," and after the establishment of the South Branch, the Zhonghua Gate area in the south of the city has been changed to "5" across the board.</p>
<p>When we use the telephone, we often encounter obstacles because the circuit is occupied, which has become a common phenomenon. This is very inappropriate. According to the person in charge of the bureau, according to regulations, the maximum percentage of calls that cannot be connected at the same time should be 20%, but the bureau has exceeded 70%. In other words, out of 100 telephones, at most 30 can be connected. In this way, it has to be said that there is a major flaw in the mission of the telephone itself.</p>
<p>The bureau was originally founded in the 26th year of the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty by the Viceroy of Liangjiang. At that time, it was a magneto type, with only 16 numbers, all occupied by important government agencies. In the 30th year of Guangxu, it was transferred to the Office of Military Training and began to open to merchants, but there were only 60-odd users. In the 3rd year of Xuantong, it was transferred to the Finance Public Office, and there were still only about 100 users. In the 2nd year of the Republic, it was taken over by the German Siemens company. In the 3rd year of the Republic, the Ministry of Communications took over the management and still used the magneto type. In the 9th year of the Republic, the Ministry of Communications decided to switch to the common battery type, purchasing the Western Electric Company's No. 1A exchange switchboard. At the same time, two branches were established in Xiaguan and Pukou. The city bureau installed a common battery type exchange with a capacity of 2,000 numbers, and Xiaguan installed a common battery type exchange with a capacity of 800 numbers. Pukou also installed a magneto type exchange with 100 numbers, laying underwater cables across the river. This was completed in the 11th year of the Republic. At this time, the number of users had increased to over 600. In the 14th year of the Republic, the Puzhen branch was opened. In the 15th year of the Republic, the Shanghai-Nanjing long-distance telephone was connected. By the first half of the 19th year of the Republic, the city had installed 2,000 numbers, Xiaguan 500 numbers, Pukou 70-odd numbers, and Puzhen 30-odd numbers. In July of that year, the world's prevailing automatic telephones were installed. In the 23rd year of the Republic, the Puzhen branch was abolished. In the 24th year of the Republic, the Pukou branch was also abolished, both merged into the Xiaguan branch. The above is a general overview of the bureau's past situation. In the early days of the bureau's establishment 36 years ago, there were only 16 telephones. After continuous improvements, it has now increased to 7,300 numbers. According to recent trends, it is still in short supply, and it will still need to be expanded soon. The future is limitless. In terms of the bureau's income and expenditure, it can collect more than 43,000 yuan in monthly rental fees and more than 5,000 yuan in machine deposit fees, for a total of more than 48,000 yuan. Recurring expenses include more than 13,000 yuan for employee salaries and 10,000 yuan for maintenance and office expenses, for a total of more than 23,000 yuan. After the automatic machine was converted, the price was more than 730,000 US dollars. The price of the new automatic machine for the South Branch was more than 142,000 US dollars. It is estimated that expanding the lines, replacing the new machines, purchasing the land, and building the bureau building cost more than 2.6 million yuan. Since the Ministry of Communications adopted the method of unified collection and payment, the bureau's income has been turned over to the ministry every month, and recurring expenses and machine price repayments are also allocated by the Ministry of Communications.</p>

<p>Spring Silkworm Seed Increase Doubles</p>
<p>Since the sales of foreign cloth were active and silk prices rose last year, the price of dried orchid also rose accordingly. Farmers in the four townships, seeing the revival of the silk industry, have been ordering silkworm seeds one after another. It is known that this year's spring silkworm seeds in the county's silkworm model area have been set at 240,000 sheets, more than one-third more than last year's spring seeds (last year's spring seeds were 180,000 sheets). According to the model area statistics, the number of spring seeds required this year is actually 360,000 sheets, double last year's number. It is expected that the number of cocoons produced will also increase by one times compared to last year, so silk factories need not worry about raw materials. In addition, the model area has decided to increase the number of spring silkworm guidance stations this year. It is assumed that there are 90 to 95 stations, and more than 80 branch guidance stations have been established in each central area. The number of branch guidance stations in the whole county will be completely determined next week.</p>
<p>County Government Handles Slave Registration</p>
<p>The county government previously received a provincial order strictly prohibiting the keeping of slaves and maids, and immediately set the period from March 10 to July 14 of this year as the investigation period. During the investigation period, those who keep slaves should apply for registration to the district public office or public security bureau. Maids may also apply for registration themselves. Those who fail to comply within the time limit will be dealt with according to law. The county government has already issued a notice to inform everyone.</p>

<p>Artesian Well Construction to Begin</p>
<p>When the citizen Qian Menggang buried his father last year, he eliminated all unnecessary extravagance and donated the saved funds for local public welfare. It is planned to dig an artesian well in a suitable location in the urban area to benefit the citizens. It is now known that he has hired nine local people, including Cao Fangzhou, as construction committee members. After several meetings, the artesian well base has been located on the vacant land in front of the Yimiao Zhaobi on West Avenue in the city. The budget is 10,000 yuan, and the contract has been signed with the Shanghai Tianquan Well Drilling Company a few days ago. They are expected to come to Cheng for investigation in the next few days.</p>

<p>Resolution of the Official Wasteland Planting Mulberry Problem</p>
<p>The Provincial Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Institute previously requested the province to allocate official wasteland near Dapaotai in Aoyu Street Township and Laohushan in Fenghuang Town to plant mulberry trees, which caused problems. The Department of Construction specially sent commissioner Zhang Lunquan, the Department of Finance sent commissioner Liu Shifu, and the Jiangdu County Government also sent member Meng Zicai. On the afternoon of the 28th, they convened a meeting at the original silkworm manufacturing institute to discuss and decide on the method with the relevant district township Bao chiefs from the first and fourth districts, as well as the institute's director, Gu Yiting, and others. The decisions were as follows: For the official wasteland near Dapaotai in Aoyu Street Township in the fourth district and Laohushan in Fenghuang Town in the first district, most of them are Yizhong (charitable burial grounds). If mulberry trees are planted in all of them, it will affect the graves. It seems that we should find ways to maintain and determine the principle of protection. Resolution:　Do not plant in places where graves are densely distributed and mulberry trees cannot be planted.　When planting mulberry trees, the Provincial Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Institute should cooperate with the township head of Fenghuang Town in the first district and the township head of Aoyu Township in the fourth district.　In all official wasteland areas, if there are those who have already reported to the Jiangdu County Government and have a formal management license for the land, they should all be given way.　In the official wasteland area, if the two townships where the public cemetery system will be implemented in the future have no other land available for the construction of a public cemetery, after the two districts request the county government to forward the request to the provincial department for approval, the original silkworm seed manufacturing institute will withdraw a portion for the construction of a public cemetery.</p>

<p>Restoring the Tenancy Arbitration Association</p>
<p>This county had a Tenancy Arbitration Association to resolve tenancy rental disputes. It was then abolished by a provincial order. All disputes were handled by the court. However, since the court's handling, both sides have rarely been convinced, and some cases have been unresolved for years. The cost of trials and summons is also expensive. Therefore, the 18th County Representatives' Conference specifically proposed this case to the province to request the restoration of the Tenancy Arbitration Association.

We all know that the two countries are geographically contiguous for over 20,000 li. This single natural geographical condition is sufficient to prove the close relationship between the two major countries in terms of politics and economics. Moreover, China and the Soviet Union are countries that uphold world peace and justice and are contributing their full efforts to economic construction and the improvement of cultural life. If China and the Soviet Union can work together in communicating Eastern and Western cultures, we can make tremendous progress on the path to increasing the happiness of humanity in the world. This major historical mission is falling on the shoulders of the cultural circles of the Republic of China and the Soviet Union. The members of this association will surely harvest the results of this great historical mission with their own heroic achievements."</p>
<p>Soviet Consul's Speech</p>
<p>Soviet Consul Bin尔维尼 then delivered a speech, "Gentlemen, Ambassador Bao is busy in Beijing and cannot come here to attend your association's grand ceremony. Therefore, I am here to offer my congratulations. The cultural circles of China and the Soviet Union, in order to express the importance of national friendship, civilization, and culture, recently established the General Association of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association in Beijing, enthusiastically demonstrating its mission. Today's establishment of the Shanghai Branch is a sign of its efforts towards a great goal, which will gather the research of many people in order to communicate the cultures of the two countries.

<h3 id="e97">Silk Improvement Association: Purchasing Silkworm Eggs and Mulberry Seedlings for Distribution to Silkworm Farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces; Weak Overseas Silk Market and Few Factories Operating in Shanghai <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports: The National Economic Council's Silk Improvement Association, in view of the nationwide silk factories closing down one after another last year due to a lack of raw materials, and in order to seek remedies, has already, together with the Construction Departments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, purchased a large quantity of silkworm eggs from abroad and also acquired 500,000 mulberry seedlings, which are being distributed to silkworm farmers in various places for cultivation. The number of silk factories operating in Shanghai is still very small. Details are noted below:</p>
<p>Expanding Mulberry Fields: The Silk Improvement Association, recognizing the active export of domestically produced raw silk last year, but because silk factories lacked raw materials, resulting in insufficient reeling and subsequent forced shutdowns, and in order to seek remedies, this year specially dispatched personnel to Italy and Japan to purchase over one million sheets of silkworm eggs, which were handed over to the Construction Departments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces for distribution to silkworm farmers in various places. Furthermore, due to the sharp increase in silkworm eggs, the existing mulberry gardens will inevitably be insufficient for allocation, so over 500,000 mulberry seedlings were purchased from the Nanjing and Zhejiang Sericulture Model Farms (at a cost of 1.3 cents per seedling) and distributed to the Construction Departments of the two provinces, for transfer to the silkworm farmer guidance centers, for silkworm farmers to purchase and plant. As for mulberry fields, over 2,000 acres have been opened up in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions, so it is anticipated that when the spring silkworms emerge this year, there will be no further shortage of raw materials.</p>
<p>Sluggish Silk Market: In the overseas silk market, Shanghai white filature silk could be sold for over 900 yuan per picul in November of last year, but by the end of December, it had begun to decline, falling to around 800 yuan. Unexpectedly, since the beginning of the year, it has become even more sluggish. Currently, the market price in Europe and America for Shanghai white filature silk is only around 720 yuan per picul. Since the factories in this city closed for the year-end accounting, they have remained closed due to a lack of raw materials and the weak silk prices, so very few have resumed operation. Currently, it is estimated that only the following have resumed operation: Jiyu (積餘) in the Xin Zha district, 240 spinning machines on Gonghe Road; Yihe (怡和) on Chengdu Road, 248 machines; Baotai (寶泰) in the South Shanghai area, 200 machines; and the Fulun (福綸) double-cocoon silk factory in the Hongkou area. All other factories have no news of resuming operation. It is generally expected that a decision will be made after the spring silkworms emerge in June.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Request to Reduce Coal Tax Rates: Ministry of Finance Approves Deferral for Discussion, Considering That There is Currently No Need for This; Will Reconsider When Tax Reduction Becomes Necessary in the Future <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The National Mining Association, citing the increasingly declining business of the industry and the inability to maintain operations, submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance last month, requesting that the mineral tax rate for coal be gradually reduced to alleviate the difficulties of businesses and benefit the mining industry. The association received a reply from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, document number 8556, which stated: The presentation dated January 88, 25th year, regarding the continued request to gradually reduce the mineral tax rate for coal, and requesting prompt approval and implementation, has been received. The Ministry has been collecting coal mineral taxes at a rate of 5%, which has not exceeded the scope stipulated by the Mining Law. Judging from the current situation of various coal mines paying taxes, the highest tax is no more than 45 cents per ton, and the lowest is only 12 cents. Compared with the simultaneous collection of mining taxes and mineral taxes by the former Beijing Ministry of Finance, the burden has actually been greatly reduced. The Ministry has repeatedly improved the mineral tax, such as allowing refunds under the mineral tax for all mines that have been charged transit taxes by the customs since the 22nd year. In July of the 23rd year, the Ministry also allowed the refund of the originally collected mineral tax based on the export tax receipts for coal sold overseas. Recently, the Ministry has also directly exempted the customs transit tax on goods that have already paid the mineral tax, in order to alleviate the difficulties of cumbersome tax payment and refund procedures and the pain of capital stagnation. All these measures are intended to alleviate the difficulties of businesses and support the real economy. Now that the burden on mining businesses has gradually been reduced, and the import taxes on foreign coal have been repeatedly increased, there is already sufficient protection for the domestic coal mining industry. The association's request to gradually reduce the mineral tax rate for coal is deemed by the Ministry to be unnecessary in the current situation. If the situation changes in the future and a tax reduction becomes necessary, it will be reviewed and processed accordingly. Please be informed.</p>

<p>The sightseeing flight of the Chinese Aviation Association Flying Club began at 10:00 am yesterday morning at the Longhua Airport. Wang Xiaolai, Director and Vice President of the Flying Club, and others went to preside over the event. A total of 20 flying club members participated in the flight, divided into two aircraft, driven by pilots Chen Buzhou and Yang Guozhu respectively. The flight concluded at 1:00 pm. Details are noted below:</p>
<p>Members Practice Aerial Maneuvers</p>
<p>The Chinese Flying Club ordered a Fleet training aircraft, which, after arriving, was used for sightseeing flights before the flying classes started, so that members could get used to aerial maneuvers and increase their interest in flying. During the registration period, there were more than 200 people, so it was decided to fly one session each on Wednesday and Saturday mornings. After arranging the order according to the registration numbers, each member was notified by letter one day in advance to participate. Yesterday was the first session, and special invitations were sent to all sectors of society to observe. In the future, those from all sectors who wish to participate in the ride can quickly register with the club so that the order can be arranged.</p>
<p>Most of the Aviation Association Directors Attended</p>
<p>The club's flying field was designated by the municipal government at Longhua Airport. Yesterday, in order to entertain all sectors of society, the new house of the Longhua Airport Management Office was specially used as a rest room, and tea and snacks were prepared. All sectors of society, all members, and Zhu Dong, the general affairs director of the club, Yang Guozhu, the research section director, Chen Buzhou, the aviation group director, and all the staff, including Peng, Zhou Dejun, Su Gongwang, Chen Shuo, Zhang Yuliang, and Bao Lengxue, gathered at the club's office at Luban Lane, Lubanfang, at 8:00 am, and were transported to Longhua Airport by the club's own cars. They arrived at around 9:00 am and had tea and snacks at the management office of the airport, with Zhu Dong and Zhou Dejun serving as hosts. Wu Tiecheng, director of the Aviation Association, representative Li Dachao, Wang Xiaolai, vice president of the club, Yao Xijiu, secretary general of the Aviation Association, and many reporters from various newspapers also arrived before 10:00 am and went to the rest room for a short rest.</p>
<p>Sightseeing in the Air, Circling Several Times</p>
<p>Two training aircraft, the "Fleet" and the "Save the Nation," were parked in the field. At exactly 10:00 am, all participants gathered in the field and first took a group photo in front of the aircraft, then started the engine to prepare for sightseeing in the air. Those participating in the flight concentrated at the designated location for roll call. Because No. 3 had not arrived, there were only 19 people. Zhu Dong served as the flight commander. First, the pilots Yang and Chen explained everything to the members, and then each put on the flight suit prepared by the club in preparation for the flight. The "Fleet" aircraft first took off at 10:30 am. Because there were many people and the time was short, it only circled around Longhua a few times and landed at 10:40 am. The second person then boarded the aircraft for a continuous flight.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Xiaolai Also Volunteered</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Xiaolai has always been enthusiastic in promoting the aviation industry, so he also volunteered and first took the "Save the Nation" aircraft for a circle to promote the cause. After getting off the aircraft, he frequently greeted the audience with a smile and looked very excited. He then left sadly and returned. Afterwards, the members boarded the aircraft and flew in succession according to the registration order. The weather was fine yesterday morning, but the intention of plastic sealing was chilling. Each member flying in the air felt very cold.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Situation in Tokyo from Sino-Japanese Wireless Telephone <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Director Tian Talks with Shanghai Branch Dentsu News Agency (1st) from this city's report, since the morning of the 26th when the attack on various government offices occurred in Japan's capital, communication between this city and Japan was cut off for a time, resulting in various rumors and the suffering of not knowing the truth of the incident. Now the incident has been completely resolved as of yesterday, and communication facilities have also been restored. Therefore, Ueda Sakuzo, Managing Director of Dentsu News Agency, used the Sino-Japanese money-free telephone this morning to report the situation in Tokyo to the Shanghai branch. The questions and answers between Director Ueda and the Shanghai branch are as follows: (Ueda) After the incident, there have been various unstable rumors, I fear that you feel uneasy, but the security in Tokyo is better than usual, the order is very good, so there is no unease. However, for a time, because telegrams and telephones were not available, news etc. could not pass through as usual, and it is a pity that the responsibilities of the news agency could not be fully utilized. Yesterday from 5:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., traffic between Tokyo and the outside was completely cut off, so this company took contact with the Yokohama branch and sent news from Yokohama to various parts of the country and overseas. (Branch) What are the deaths and injuries of this decision incident? (Ueda) Only important people such as Takahashi, Saito, Watanabe, etc., and only 5 police officers died in the line of duty, but all of them were guarding the Prime Minister's official residence and other government offices. Not a single civilian or police officer in the city was killed or injured. (Branch) Were there any deaths or injuries when suppressing the rebellious soldiers? (Ueda) Of course, not a single shot was fired, and everything was completely stabilized, so there were no deaths or injuries. Rather than saying it was due to force, mother Ning's advice was effective. (Branch) How do you observe the organization of the successor cabinet? (Ueda) Who organizes the successor cabinet, there is nothing to say in the current state, and the successor to the deceased Saito Naifu is the first question, and Admiral Kawai Osamu, etc., from the Privy Council, are calling for a higher voice, but the general atmosphere is that those who come are not suitable to be biased towards one party and one faction, and rely solely on the power of one side, so it should be a unified and powerful cabinet for the country, that is, an ideal cabinet that can boast both internally and externally. The appearance of such a cabinet is what the general public hopes for, and the military will not disagree. As for the political parties, the Minsei Party goes without saying, and the Seiyukai has also taken a supportive attitude, so if they wish to enter the cabinet, they can recommend party members.</p>

<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reports: Former Mayor of Nanjing Wei Daoming recently entered Beijing from Shanghai to continue seeking instructions from President Chiang. Now that the matter is over, he took the Beijing-Shanghai night express train and returned to Shanghai at 7:00 am yesterday morning. After getting off the train in Zhenru, he took the waiting car and returned to his private residence in Fan Garden, Haige Road, for a rest. He met with reporters and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Going to Hong Kong to Welcome Wang</p>
<p>Wei said first, "My trip to Beijing was to visit old friends in Beijing and to meet with President Chiang for a private conversation. There were no other special tasks. As Mr. Wang Liangchou (Chonghui) is about to return home and arrive in Hong Kong, I intend to rush to meet him in advance. I am returning to Shanghai to prepare my luggage. However, I am suffering from a severe cold and feel slightly unwell, so I plan to rest for a few days before heading south again. It is still difficult to decide when I will leave Shanghai. It is expected that I can leave by the 7th of this month at the latest. As for Mr. Li Xiangen, Director of the Guangshao South Section Railway Bureau, who came north on the same ship with me, he took the ship south on the 29th and returned to Xunyuan, his hometown, for a short stay before returning to Han to report."</p>
<p>Wang Will Arrive in Hong Kong on the 10th</p>
<p>Wei continued to talk about Mr. Wang Liangchou, who left Europe on the 16th of last month on the North German Company's Sanghorst. He returned to China. I received a telegram from Wang on the way, saying that he would arrive in Hong Kong on the 10th of this month. Although Mr. Wang's purchased ticket was for a direct trip to Shanghai, he urgently wanted to meet with Mr. Hu Zhantang (Hanmin) and others to talk about the past, so after arriving in Hong Kong, he did not intend to take the original ship north. After meeting with Mr. Hu and the comrades in the Southwest, he will set off north again, pass through Shanghai and enter Beijing, visit the central authorities and talk about everything."</p>
<p>Hu Decides to Come North</p>
<p>The reporter asked Wei about the rumors about Hu Hanmin's coming north, which have been circulating in recent days, causing much speculation and confusion. According to Wei, Mr. Hu is still staying in Guangdong Province. The reason why he has not come north is purely due to the climate and there are no other special reasons. As soon as the weather here is warmer, Mr. Hu will be able to prepare to depart and come north. As for the rumors that Mr. Hu must wait to meet Mr. Wang Liangchou before coming north together, it is unfounded. The opinions of Beijing and Guangdong are very harmonious, and there is no need for so-called mediation.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Jewelry Industry Petition Delegation: Waiting for Approval from the Ministry of Finance; Will Continue to Strive If There Is No Result; Representatives Departed from Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reports: After returning to Shanghai from Beijing, the National Jewelry Industry Petition Delegation, consisting of Fu Shengmao from Shanghai, Zou Jizhi from Hankou, Yu Cangsen from Nanjing, Cai Jilun from Jiangsu Province, and Gu Sumin from Zhejiang Province, gathered at the meeting and requested assistance from the National Federation of Commercial Associations and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. The relevant agencies sent personnel to meet with them and promised to do everything possible to assist, submit a request to the authorities, and demand the amendment of the silver usage regulations. At 2:00 pm, the representatives went to the Sanbei Steamship Company and the Chung Hwa Bank to visit Yu Qiaqing and Du Yuesheng, respectively, to make the same request. Yu and Du received the representatives and promised to provide assistance. The representatives were satisfied and returned to the meeting to report and deliberate on the future direction of the struggle. They said that the petition had come to an end and that they could only wait for the approval of the Ministry of Finance. If there was no satisfactory result, they would continue to strive to maintain their livelihoods. It was also heard that the representatives had been in Shanghai for many days, and that each had business to attend to and it was inconvenient to be away for long. Therefore, they left one after another yesterday. Zou Jizhi, the representative from Hankou, took the 12:00 noon express train to Beijing and returned to his hometown in Xunyang for a short stay before returning to Han to report.

<h3 id="e109">Metered Telephone Charges in the Concession: After the Implementation of the New Regulations <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports: The new regulations for metered telephone charges in the Special District of this city came into effect as scheduled yesterday. The telephone company is currently considering the issue of installing meter counters. The Special District Telephone Issue Committee, in order to resolutely resist, specially announced to users throughout the city yesterday to implement the claim and replied to the city's federated branch that it would not disband and would continue to proceed. Details are explored as follows:</p>
<p>The New Telephone Regulations Come into Effect as Scheduled</p>
<p>The period for the Shanghai Telephone Company's new metered charging regulations in the Special District has ended yesterday. The telephone company's procedures for implementing the new regulations were prepared long ago. In addition to repeatedly notifying users, from 1:00 am yesterday, the company's Jiangxi Road Central Station in the Public Concession area, and the seven branch stations in the West District's Medhurst Road, the East District's Hongqiao Road and Ward Road, the Central District's Fujian Road, the North District's North Jiangxi Road, and the South District's Ba Liqiao Road and Bi Xun Road in the French Concession area, installed a total meter of 48,617 active user machines in the administered districts and activated them at the same time. Except for business users who communicate with the company, the new regulations apply to both business and residential phones.</p>
<p>Company Authorities Consider Installing Meters</p>
<p>Although the Municipal Council and the Shanghai Telephone Company authorities have stated that they cannot change the new regulations in the face of opposition from all parties, according to reporters' inquiries with the company, the Municipal Council Board of Directors has indicated that it may accept the suggestions from all parties to install automatic meter counters next to the phone of each user. They recently transferred a discussion to the highest authority of the telephone company to solicit opinions on technical aspects of this issue. The company has a large number of users and would be very burdened to separately install such sub-meters, but in order not to run counter to the users' wishes, they will consider it so that it can be formally submitted to the Municipal Council for review in the future.</p>
<p>Telephone Committee Notifies Users</p>
<p>The Special District Telephone Issue Committee, composed of various groups in this city, specially issued an emergency announcement to all users in the Special District yesterday in order to implement its claim and resolutely resist the ineffectiveness of negotiations against metered billing: We are informing you that the Shanghai Telephone Company's new regulations have been implemented since the 1st, and all our users have been burdened with additional charges since that day. Although this committee has repeatedly negotiated with the Municipal Council and the Shanghai Telephone Company, it is useless as they take advantage of the expansion of external forces and hold power, ignoring public opinion. Furthermore, the Chinese Ratepayers Association had repeatedly stated and requested the Chinese directors to come forward to negotiate, requesting to increase the basic count, although it failed to meet the wishes of the citizens, it was somewhat comforting to us. However, the recent claim has suddenly changed, and they have indicated that they may accept the company's new charging regulations. Yesterday's newspaper reported that the association solemnly stated that "there has never been any intention to recognize or accept it" and advocated "not using" it as a manifestation of the facts. This committee has repeatedly decided to propose discussions at the meeting, and there is a question about whether the users throughout the city have this firm solidarity power. Therefore, we are now sending letters to various sectors of society. If you can allow the phone to be removed, it would be a thorough view. If you must use the phone in practice, please record it at any time during use and fill in the date and type separately to make a statistics. At the end of this month, submit the form for calculating the settlement to the meeting as a basis. This committee will uphold the spirit of the past and do its utmost to seek the final victory for all users. As for all the proceedings, we still hope that all sectors of society will not hesitate to give advice. We are sincerely looking forward to it. We salute you with our best wishes.</p>
<p>Responding to the City Federation Expresses Striving</p>
<p>The Telephone Issue Committee sent a letter to the citizens' branches of each district in this city yesterday: We are responding to your letter. We have learned everything. Regarding the preparation of this committee to dissolve, according to the organizational law, it must be decided by a joint meeting of various groups. Before dissolution, we will naturally adhere to our consistent aim and continue to fight. We are grateful for all the suggestions from your association, which will be submitted to the scheduled meeting on the 10th of this month for discussion in order to obtain a thorough solution.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Peddler Suddenly Dies While Being Pursued by Western Police; Western Police Admit to Hitting Him Twice; Cause of Death Unknown, Requires Autopsy <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>As reported in previous newspapers, at around 8:00 AM on the 28th of last month, a peddler of unknown name, aged over thirty, was selling stationery in front of the Chengzong Middle School on Tangshan Road when a Western police officer No. 132 from the Huishan Police Station arrived in a police car, intending to arrest the peddler. The peddler, fearing arrest, fled to the kitchen of the Yuda Store behind the Yangzheng Middle Lane (No. 413 Tangshan Road). The Western police officer also chased after him. Shortly after, the peddler suddenly collapsed in the house, unconscious. He was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died. The body was taken to the morgue on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Song Genshan, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, accompanied by two medical examiners, Wei and Zhang, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. He then took the case. The Western police chief, Philip, reported that at 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the deceased and several peddlers were gambling in front of a school on Tangshan Road, so the police station sent Western police officer No. 132 to arrest them. The deceased, seeing the police arrive, was extremely frightened and fled to the back door of No. 413. Due to the sudden stimulation of running forty-four feet, he collapsed. He requested that the body be autopsied. Wang Zian, 21 years old, from Nanjing, who works at the Yuda Store at No. 413 Tangshan Road, testified that when the Western police officer chased after the deceased, he fled to the back door of his store. He was behind the counter, so he did not see the Western police officer hit him. A maid living on the upper floor witnessed everything. Shen Wu, 32 years old, from Huzhou, who works as a maid on the upper floor of the store, testified that yesterday morning, she was near the handrail and saw a peddler running to the back of her house with a basket. The Western police officer chased after him and asked whose basket he was carrying. He begged and said it was his. The Western police officer hit his face twice with his hand. When the police officer was about to leave, the deceased suddenly collapsed. Seeing this, she shouted, and the police officer came back and pressed a wet towel on his face several times, but he did not wake up. The police officer then sent him to the hospital in his car. Western police officer No. 132, named Bass, a British national, 28 years old, admitted to lightly patting the deceased's jaw twice. Mr. Song then ruled that the cause of death of the deceased, whose name is unknown, was unclear and should be autopsied by the court's medical examiner for further verification. Since the family of the deceased has not arrived, the body will be handed over to the Pushan Villa for burial after the autopsy.</p>
<h3 id="e122">State-Run China Merchants Bureau Implements Reform Measures; Layoffs of Redundant Staff Have Been Implemented; Elimination of Long-Standing Malpractices Awaits Progress <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shenshi News Agency, after the internal reorganization of the state-run China Merchants Bureau and the abolition of the Supervisory Committee, Cai Zengji, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, Tan Boying, General Manager of the Xingye Trust Company, and Lao Mian, sent by the Ministry of Communications, were appointed as General Manager and Deputy Managers to vigorously rectify all the Bureau's operations. The reform steps of the Bureau are as follows:</p>
<p>Laying off Redundant Staff to Save Expenses</p>
<p>The past situation of the state-run China Merchants Bureau was due to excessive staff and huge expenses. Therefore, although revenue had slightly increased, it was still insufficient to cover the wasteful expenditures. Therefore, laying off redundant staff was an urgent task. After taking office, Mr. Cai and others followed the newly promulgated organizational regulations of the Ministry of Communications to conduct recruitment examinations in order to strictly lay off staff to meet actual needs. Although all the Bureau's staff initially opposed it, they eventually complied with the order to take the examination. Now the oral and written examinations have been completed, and the staff to be laid off or retained have been submitted to the Ministry for approval and announcement.</p>
<p>The Comprador System Will Be Abolished</p>
<p>In addition, the Bureau's comprador system has been the biggest obstacle to the development of its business. For example, the practice of contracting passenger tickets and soliciting as many passengers as possible often resulted in temporary structures being erected outside the designated berths, causing overcrowding. This not only posed a danger to travelers but also harmed the Bureau's revenue and passengers' interests. The malpractice was extremely serious and should be thoroughly abolished. All business will be directly managed by the Bureau. It is currently being planned.</p>
<p>Abolish Contracting and Strictly Prohibit Theft and Leakage</p>
<p>In addition, the cargo warehouse contracting system is also the easiest to steal and leak. Because the cargo warehouse business of the Bureau has always been contracted by the warehouse manager, the Bureau cannot directly manage it. There are often cases of falsely demanding money from merchants. And for the labor force, the warehouse manager contracts it to the foreman, and the foreman then hires the porters, resulting in layers of exploitation, so that the laborers cannot get a reasonable wage and become increasingly poor. Theft and leakage occur as a result. Therefore, this contracting system is also being planned for cancellation.</p>
<p>Eliminate Malpractices of Stewards and Sailors</p>
<p>The stewards and sailors on all ships of the Bureau have always been hired by compradors. They only need to have cash deposits as a guarantee to be qualified, resulting in uneven quality and limited knowledge. There are often cases of insulting passengers, stealing passenger goods, privately selling berths, demanding exorbitant wine fees, smuggling drugs, trafficking in people, and engaging in corruption and fraud. This has a great impact on the company's business and national discipline. At the time of vigorously implementing the New Life Movement, this malpractice should also be immediately corrected. The Bureau will strictly examine the stewards and sailors on all ships in the future and thoroughly reform them.</p>
<h3 id="e123">The City's Severe Cold Has Not Abated; Wind Direction Has Changed, Warming Up in the Next Few Days; Prices of Vegetables and Other Items Have Doubled <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The severe cold in the city since yesterday morning has not abated. The northwest wind continued to blow yesterday, causing the water pipes to freeze completely. The ditches along the roads in shaded areas were frozen until noon. Most of the inland rivers were also frozen, causing a sharp decrease in the number of vegetable boats coming to Shanghai from Suzhou River. The market prices of vegetables in various small vegetable markets suddenly increased more than twice. Chinese cabbage costs more than 500 copper coins per catty. The temperature is still around 24 degrees. According to astronomical sources, the high pressure has now left the country. The wind may turn to the southeast in the afternoon, and it may warm up in the next few days.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Sang Quansan Sentenced to Imprisonment for False Accusation of Public Officials; The Plaintiff's Incidental Civil Lawsuit Rejected <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Sang Quansan, a Ningbo native who lives at No. 5, Lane 217, Tongfu Road, West Shanghai, and runs a military uniform business, borrowed eight pieces of jewelry from his fellow villager Xu Zhiliang in June of last year to raise money in an emergency. He did not return them for a long time. Xu then asked Wang Xiaoliang, a comprador from the Hongsheng Foreign Firm, to negotiate with Sang and lend him money to retrieve the jewelry. However, Sang suddenly had the idea of swallowing the jewelry, claiming that the jewelry originally belonged to him and was worth more than 20,000 gold. He said that Wang bought the jewelry from him and agreed on a price, but Wang only gave him more than 4,300 yuan when he took the jewelry, intending to default on the remaining payment. Wang and Xu said that Sang coveted the jewelry and fabricated nonsense. At that time, the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, considering the friendship between villagers, convened Sang, Wang, Xu, and others to mediate. Sang claimed that the jewelry was originally mortgaged to him by Xu, but he could not produce evidence of the mortgage. Xu then stated that he had indeed asked Sang to mortgage the jewelry to a certain bank on his behalf, but he had redeemed it on time. He was grateful to Sang for his economic assistance, so he generously lent him the jewelry. He did not expect Sang to repay kindness with ingratitude and try to embezzle it. The mediators, having understood the situation, did not side with Sang, and the mediation failed. Sang still did not give up and filed a criminal self-lawsuit against Wang Xiaoliang and Xu Zhiliang in the First Special District Court, accusing Wang and Xu of conspiring to defraud him of the jewelry and requesting that they be punished for fraud. He also filed an incidental civil lawsuit, requesting that the two defendants be ordered to repay the owed amount of 16,667 yuan or return the original jewelry. After being accused, Wang and Xu also hired lawyers to state the course of the dispute, claiming that Sang was actually trying to embezzle the jewelry, fabricating a lawsuit, and requesting that it be rejected. They also requested that he be severely punished according to the law for the crime of false accusation, to warn against cunning and treacherous behavior. Judge Ye Shengchao of the First Special Court repeatedly held hearings and investigated the evidence in detail for more than a month. Recently, it was finally concluded. The verdict was announced in court the day before yesterday afternoon. The main points were that Sang Quansan intended to cause others to be subject to criminal punishment, falsely accused the competent public officials, and was sentenced to two months of imprisonment. Wang Xiaoliang and Xu Zhiliang were both innocent. The plaintiff's incidental civil lawsuit was rejected.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Electrical Manufacturing Industry Discusses the Copper Shortage Problem; Hosts Banquet Yesterday for Mr. Wang Jiliang, a Mining Engineer Who Studied in the United States; Lectures on the Overview of the Daye and Yangxin Copper Mines <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electrical Manufacturing Industry Association believes that the need for copper in electrical manufacturing plants is extremely large, but there is no clear record of copper production in our country in the world mineral production records. Since the price increase last year, the price of copper has gradually soared. Old copper scraps have been exhausted, and Shanghai copper skin factories are almost at a standstill. However, the demand is increasing, forming a copper shortage. The Association, thinking from the root cause, paid attention to the study of copper mines. Yesterday, Mr. Hu Xiyuan, Chairman of the Association, and Lin Chaote, Director-General, hosted a banquet at the Shipping Club for Mr. Wang Jiliang, a mining engineer who studied in the United States, and invited him to lecture on the overview of the Daye and Yangxin copper mines in Hubei Province. According to Mr. Wang, the mining area is 30 li wide, and the transportation is very convenient. If large-scale mining is carried out, 50 tons of copper can be produced every day. A part of our country's copper needs can be self-sufficient. According to the survey conducted by the Association, Shanghai alone needs more than 4,000 dan of copper skin per month for flashlight factories, and 500,000 pounds of copper sheets and copper wires per year for electric fans and motors. In addition, the amount needed for national defense and light and heavy industries is more than ten or a hundred times this amount.</p>

<p>Zhenjiang Power Plant Machinery Damaged, Huasheng Factory Sends Technicians to Repair</p>
<p>Zhenjiang is the capital of Jiangsu Province, with a dense population of households. The electricity business is developing rapidly. On the 17th of last month, the core of the large generator of the Dazhao Electric Company in that area suddenly broke down. Unable to find a solution locally, they urgently telegraphed the Huasheng Electric Manufacturing Factory in Shanghai, requesting that personnel be sent quickly to repair it. After receiving the telegram, the factory sent a number of technicians and workers from the engineering department, who rushed to Zhenjiang overnight. They worked day and night, and after ten days, the entire project was completed on the 27th, restoring the bright night-time lighting to its original state. The daytime power generation was as before. The citizens there greatly praised the technicians and workers of the Huasheng Factory.</p>
<p>Sister and Brother in Litigation</p>
<p>Wu, the wife of Yang Weilan, had some savings. Her husband had passed away many years ago. Yang Wu's biological mother, Wu Chen, suddenly fell ill last year on the first month of the lunar year and passed away on the 23rd of the twelfth month. Her son, Chang Liushun, never came to visit. After Yang Wu notified Liushun, he ignored it. As a result, Yang Wu held the funeral, spending more than a thousand yuan on medical and funeral expenses. She repeatedly sought reimbursement from Liushun without success. Yang Wu then retained lawyer Shen Zongyong to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court, seeking to recover the funds. The court approved the request. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Yuhai presided over the hearing in the Fourth Tribunal. First, the plaintiff recounted the events. The defendant argued that Wu Chen was not his biological mother, but that his biological mother was surnamed Li. However, after repeated questioning by Judge Zhang, he admitted that Wu Chen was indeed his biological mother and had passed away in November of last year, but claimed that he had not been notified by his sister and therefore did not know about it. Judge Zhang, finding that Wu Liushun lacked human ethics and reason, advised him to go outside and negotiate a settlement to end the lawsuit. Unexpectedly, Wu Liushun was very stubborn. Judge Zhang then ordered everyone to withdraw and await instructions. After the court adjourned, Wu Liushun guarded the door of the decision chamber, claiming that he wanted to get his sister and be satisfied. Judge Zhang, fearing a fight, ordered Wu Shunliu to be separated from Yang Wu and sent away.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Yesterday Onwards: Prohibition of Live Plucking of Pig Bristles; Joint Announcement by the Three Bureaus of Public Safety, Social Affairs, and Public Health; Pig Merchants Send Representatives to Board Ships and Cut Bristles, Maintaining Good Order <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Huadong News Agency reports that the issue of prohibiting the live plucking of pig bristles has been a long-standing dispute. Previously, the Social Affairs Bureau, together with the Public Health and Public Safety Bureaus, convened relevant pig industry groups to discuss prohibition measures. These measures were implemented starting yesterday, and a public notice was posted yesterday morning as follows: "Live plucking of pig bristles is a cruel act and detrimental to meat hygiene, as has been repeatedly announced. However, it has been found that some individuals still privately engage in live plucking, deliberately violating the law. In addition to investigating and punishing such acts at any time, to eradicate this bad habit and eliminate the cruel act of live plucking for profit, this Bureau, in consultation with the other Bureaus, has decided that from March 1, 1936, all pigs transported to Shanghai must have their bristles cut off before being allowed to enter. Any live plucking of pig bristles will be considered animal cruelty and will be subject to a fine of five cents to five yuan, as stipulated in Article 7 of the Shanghai Slaughter Inspection Regulations. This decision has been reported to the Municipal Government for record, and all county governments in the areas where the pigs originate have been requested to instruct pig merchants to comply. All pig industry groups in Shanghai have also been instructed to comply. This joint announcement is hereby issued to urge everyone to abide by it and refrain from attempting to violate it, lest they be punished." Signed: Cai Jinjun, Director of the Public Safety Bureau; Wu Xingya, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau; Li Tingan, Director of the Public Health Bureau. In compliance with the order, various pig industry groups implemented the measures starting yesterday. The Pig Merchants Association specially dispatched 20 people to the pig ships at Wusongkou to assist in cutting off the uncut bristles. Personnel from the Public Health Bureau's office were also dispatched to supervise all arriving ships. All pig industry workers expressed their compliance with the above measures, so the order was well maintained. All the pig bristles were given to the boatmen of the ships, which was supported by all parties.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Rice Shop Owner Jiang Rongfu: Concubine Chen Demands Treatment as "Two Heads of the Family" with a Monthly Allowance of Sixty Yuan; Payments Suddenly Stopped, Leading to Lawsuit <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Rongfu, a native of Jiading, is 59 years old and owns the Changhe Rice Shop on Niuzhuang Road. His concubine, Madam Chen, a Ningbo native (also 99 years old), residing at No. 2 Changqing Lane, Guoqing Road, has engaged lawyer Xu Wufang to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the First Special District Court, seeking alimony. The main points of her lawsuit are as follows: Madam Chen married the defendant at the age of 21 and held a wedding ceremony at the Qu family's Lao Yongxing Garden. However, after the marriage, she discovered that the defendant already had a wife. Since it was a fait accompli, there was nothing she could do. Therefore, the defendant treated her as "two heads of the family." Madam Chen bore two sons and two daughters. The son, named Chen Xia, is now 28 years old. One daughter is deceased, and the third daughter, named Mao Yuan, is now 19 years old. In 1922, because the defendant failed to fulfill his alimony obligations, Cang Zhisheng, the manager of the Xiechangde Rice Shop, mediated and stipulated that Madam Chen would receive a monthly living allowance of 60 yuan and five dou of rice. However, when the deceased daughter died, the defendant ignored all funeral expenses, which Madam Chen had to borrow from others. Recently, the defendant suddenly reduced the agreed monthly living allowance to 40 yuan. Since November of last year, he has not paid even the 40 yuan. Madam Chen sent her daughter Mao Yuan to demand payment, but to no avail. Therefore, she has no choice but to file a lawsuit, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay a monthly living allowance of 120 yuan, as well as 2,400 yuan in loans, and to bear the litigation costs. The case was heard in the 12th Civil Division of the First Special District Court by Judge Cao Jun the other day, and the hearing was adjourned to a later date.</p>

At midnight, while walking near Jalou Road, they met a prostitute named Wang Xiaomei, also known as Liu Wang, 36 years old. After some negotiation, they agreed on a price of one yuan in national currency for the night. They went together to Room 3 of the Quan'an Inn, No. 28 Lan Wei Ai Road, run by a Ningbo woman named Qian Ge. However, just as they entered the room, a hooligan named Li Wansheng from Anhui, 35 years old, burst in and demanded 1.4 yuan for the night. Wang Xiaolang told Li that they had already agreed on a price on the street and that Li should not interfere. This led to an argument, and Li Wansheng started hitting Wang and kicking him in the lower body. As a result, Wang's scrotum was injured, and he fell to the ground. Seeing the damage he had caused, Li fled the scene. The innkeeper reported the incident to the police, who sent detectives to take the injured man to the hospital for treatment.

<h3 id="e139">Improvement of Qimen Black Tea: Three Organizations Actively Working; All Equipment and Arrangements Completed; Quality of New Tea Expected to Improve This Year <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Shenshi News Agency reports that Anhui Province is famous for its tea production. Western Anhui is known for its green tea, while the black tea from Qimen and other places in southern Anhui is even more renowned internationally. The total annual export volume reaches 7-8 million dan, worth tens of millions of yuan, which is crucial to the rural economy. In the past, sales to the Soviet Union, Germany, and the United States often could not meet demand. However, in recent years, due to tea merchants adhering to old methods and failing to improve the tea-making and packaging, they have failed to meet the needs of foreign countries. In addition, competition from tea sales from Japan, India, and Java has impacted the international market, resulting in the loss of international market share year after year, and the tea industry has declined. In view of this, the Ministry of Industry, in cooperation with the National Sales Commission and the Anhui Provincial Government, has first established a Tea Improvement Center in Qimen, Anhui, to study and improve Qimen black tea using technical methods. The center is divided into technical and general affairs departments. The technical department is further divided into tea testing, cooperative promotion, packaging improvement, grading testing, and mechanical testing, to improve packaging methods and increase production quality. The machinery has been purchased from overseas. A large-scale tea farm and factory building have been built on Phoenix Mountain in the area, and local tea farmers have been recruited and given basic training. According to news from the tea industry in Shanghai, the equipment at the Qimen Improvement Center, which has been under preparation since last year, has now been arranged. The buildings and machinery are expected to be installed this month. It is expected that the new Qimen black tea will have a distinctive quality when it enters the market this year. On the one hand, it is also planned to cooperate with syndicates to promote cooperative societies, provide long-term loans for the tea industry, and assist tea farmers' economy, in order to increase production.</p>

<p>The Dongjiadu Ferry in Nanshi was taken over by the Xingye Society yesterday (the 1st) and officially opened for business. On the first day of the ferry's operation, more than 300 former ferrymen gathered at both docks, one at Dongjiadu in Puxi and the other on the opposite bank in Pudong. They held printed materials (submissions) containing ten reasons from a certain Shanghai celebrity to the Municipal Government and distributed them to passersby, creating a turbulent atmosphere. Seeing this situation, the dock manager, fearing that an incident would occur, immediately closed the iron gate. After learning about the situation, the Water Police promptly dispatched several water police detectives to suppress the situation on both sides of the river. The Municipal Public Security Bureau also dispatched 70 officers from the Fourth Detachment to persuade the ferrymen to disperse. It was not until after 2 PM that the ferrymen were persuaded to disperse, and normal ferry operations resumed. Fortunately, no incident occurred.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Eight Thousand Football Fans Overjoyed: Donghua Wins the Scoto Cup Again; Portugal Suffers a Crushing Defeat of 3-1; Collacot Did Not Attend Yesterday Due to Injury <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Donghua surprisingly defeated the strong Portugal team with an excellent performance yesterday to win the Scoto Cup and keep it for another year. The result, a 3-1 victory, overjoyed the eight thousand spectators at Yiyuan, who cheered wildly. Donghua's momentum was at its peak. Portuguese center Collacot did not attend due to injury, which weakened the Portuguese team considerably. The details of the fierce battle are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e142">Two Goals Within Ten Minutes <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Just after 2 PM, Yierbei Road was already packed with people. The east and west stands of Yiyuan were filled to capacity, totaling over eight thousand people. The atmosphere was intense, and everyone was discussing the strength of the two teams. When the two teams appeared, the Portuguese captain Collacot was indeed absent due to a foot injury, which relieved the concerned spectators. However, given Donghua's momentum yesterday, even if Collacot had been present, they would still have been able to secure victory. As can be seen from the details of the battle, after the kickoff, the Portuguese team took the lead, but it was immediately intercepted. Donghua's several advances were also blocked. After five or six minutes of stalemate, Donghua's army advanced from the center. Sun Jinshun broke through alone, dodging the defender and making a sweeping cross-kick, low, diagonal, and fast. Portuguese goalkeeper Max stared blankly, not knowing what to do. Donghua took the lead with a score of 1-0. At the center kickoff, Portuguese right winger Xiao Kaositan attacked along the side, but Li Ning met him with his abdomen, forcing a corner kick. At this time, the situation was dangerous. If Donghua had not taken precautions early, they would have been in trouble. The ball went to the right, and Donghua's five forwards swept in like a whirlwind. Zhou Guangzhong sent a cross-kick. Dai Linjing attacked together, and Sun Jinshun deflected the ball slightly, sending it into the net again. The score was 2-0, only eleven minutes after the start of the match.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Both Offense and Defense Presented Thrilling Moments; Donghua's Momentum Was at its Peak; Portuguese Goal Presented Many Dangerous Scenes <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Donghua's momentum was at its peak, and after several maneuvers, the Portuguese goal presented many dangerous scenes. You Liang kicked a left shot at the side of the goal, but unfortunately, it leaked under the post. Lin Jing pulled back and shot fiercely, but it was saved by Marx. Losing two excellent chances caused the spectators to wring their hands in frustration. The Portuguese army launched many counterattacks, but to no avail. However, Donghua's fight also presented several dangerous scenes. Xiao Kaositan went all the way to the baseline and crossed the ball, but Shang Yi was unable to catch it. Fortunately, Li Ning headed the ball out of danger, and the ball returned to the center, becoming a chaotic battle again. Li Yichen was inspired and sent the ball out diagonally. After a maneuver, Xiao Kaositan's ambition did not die, and he tried to advance again, but he was intercepted by Yichen. Qiu Ting's shot did not find a chance, and Xiao Kaositan revived, kicking a high ball in a good position. Fortunately, Lu Dage caught it correctly and avoided a disaster. The Portuguese army then advanced from the center. Seeing the situation was not good, Zhong En ran out to rescue and kicked the ball out not far. At this time, the rear was empty, and enemy riders trampled on it again. Fortunately, Shang Quan came out from behind and forced a corner kick. Xiao Kaositan was the kicker and was about to show his courage when the time for the first half ended. Donghua took the lead with a score of 2-0.</p>

<p>You Liang had a good chance at 30 yards out with a high shot, but it was just a little short. At this time, the battle situation was extremely dull. Donghua had many good opportunities, but they all turned out to be empty promises. Sun Jinshun advanced to the goal but was blocked and passed to the back. Yun You caught up with a kick, but it was punched out by Max. In a split second, Jinshun broke in again alone and passed the ball to the bottom line. Dai Linjing kicked the ball and it bounced back from the goal. Not only that, but fortunately, Donghua's momentum was at its peak, and although the Portuguese army launched a fierce siege, it was ultimately turned into a corner kick by Li Ning. Li Yichen's guest appearance as a defender was also excellent, as solid as Mount Tai. Neither the middle nor the left could cross the boundary.</p>
<h3 id="e145">One Joy and One Worry Make it 3-1; Portuguese Corner Kick Did Not Succeed <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Portuguese corner kick did not succeed. Shangdong sent the ball to the front line. Xiao Sanzi was as fast as lightning, but unfortunately he was offside. At this time, Donghua was in danger again. After Yichen got the ball, he sent it out, but Zhong En could not catch up. The Portuguese army had already surged forward. Li Ning kicked the ball out, again out of danger. Donghua made three attacks but failed. The most regrettable was when You Liang passed the ball to Jin Hai, and Jinshun caught up with a kick, low and fast, but it was saved by Max. After a slight maneuver, Donghua's luck arrived again. When Qiu Ting threw in the boundary ball, the Portuguese defender blocked it. Qiu Ting ran up and sent the ball in, Jin Hai's shot was caught, the ball went out not far, Jinshun turned at the bottom line, Jin Hai caught up, and You Liang took the opportunity to kick the ball into the net diagonally. The score of 3-0 caused the spectators to rejoice. At the center kickoff, the Portuguese army gnashed their teeth and launched a fierce attack. A long-legged deer was caught off guard and unknowingly allowed Da Luo Chailiao to shoot the ball into the net. With a score of 3-1, Donghua was still in the lead.</p>

<p>Donghua Conceded one goal, but as the match entered the final nine minutes, Donghua's two counterattacks were unsuccessful. The Portuguese left road was again active, and Yichen committed a handball foul, and the position was extremely dangerous. Fortunately, Da Kaositan hit the baseball in the field. Youliang was the first to start a left-handed ball, which Jinshun attacked at one time, and Dai Linjing's crowd made one shot from among the crowd, but Max was in a hurry to attack it, and it had already rubbed against the post, but the referee failed to take care of it, and no record was made. The game continued to be played, with Jingshun's attack and the door being connected, and Qiuting was active on the bottom line, and the sound of the whistle at the end of the game has already been sounded. Donghua was defeated by the Portuguese army 3-1, In addition to winning the Scotia Cup for the two consecutive times, he also washed away the shame of losing to the Portuguese army 5-3 in the league. After the game, Mr. Green Xiao, the president of the Western Union, gave a speech and awarded the trophy to Donghua captain Feng You to accept, and then kept the Scotia Cup for one year.

<p>The Western Union Football Association Group A League, Yuyou vs. Lancashire, was held at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Yanping Road Shenyuan Stadium. Since its launch, Yuyou has won every game and has created a situation of four wins in four games. Lancashire is a substitute for Ennis and is considered strong, but judging from its battle with West Merchants, it lost 5-3, so its skills are not as strong as expected. Therefore, Yuyou has a considerable chance of winning. In the first half, the entire Yuyou team joined forces to attack. Under the precarious situation, Zhong Yuxiang scored a goal within only two minutes of the ending time. In the second half, Lancashire counterattacked fiercely. Yuyou Zhong Yuxiang was also injured and left the field. With ten people fighting, fortunately, the ball was in good luck, and Lancashire's several shots were averted. Yuyou turned bad luck into good luck, and again took a 2-1 lead. In general, Lancashire suffered a 3-1 defeat.</p>

<p>Before 3:00, Yuyou took the lead in the field, practicing his feet. Lancashire followed. When the referee Li Nuosi's Hujia sound rang, the two teams immediately deployed their troops to fight hand-to-hand. The ball was moved under Dun Du's feet, and Hei Tan intercepted the treasure in the middle, and Yao passed the ball into the field and rushed to the bottom line, where Pai Lai stopped him and forced a corner kick, but fortunately the guard was strong and did not lose an inch of land. Yun Fenglin's central defender line and troops transferred the army, and Pai Lai lost his way before the horse, and Cheng even failed to catch him, so that a good opportunity was lost, and Liang Shutang returned to the battlefield and entered the camp, Si Qianxian, Qiaosheng greeted him with his head, but was hit by Bei Qimei and was rescued. At this time, the thief's momentum was rampant, and they attacked the door twice, and thanks to Xiao Zhang's agility and skillful hands, they turned the danger into safety.</p>
<p>The Yuyou team took a one-ball lead</p>
<p>Zhong Yongshen launched an uprising from the border and went straight to the tiger's lair, passing three norths at the bottom line and immediately passing to the middle road, where the small black carbon pillow was waiting, heading into the net, but it was offside, and Yuyou Asia was not discouraged, and made persistent efforts. The Lancashire ball gate Bei Qimei, high blocks and low blocks, gave a brilliant performance, saving a lot of dangerous balls, Xiao Heitan rose in the central army, and Xi Qiaosheng crossed Chencang secretly, getting the ball and delivering it to the enemy's hinterland, Zhong Yuxiang was near the water tower, turned over and pulled the ball, before the ball touched the ground, he lifted his leg and shot hard, directly hitting the core, and the record was opened. This ball was scored, only two minutes away from the ending time. When time was reported, Yuyou took a one-ball lead.</p>
<p>Zhong Yuxiang Injured and Left the Field</p>
<p>After the Lemon, the war broke out again, and Lancashire was determined to break the cauldron and sink the boat, and its momentum was impressive. Pai Lan sat in the center, holding a branch and walking quickly, and hit the door, Xiao Zhang was not flustered, and calmly waved it out, and Dun Du led his troops into the territory, and went straight to the Yuyou formation. At the 15-yard point, Jiang Zhang and the two internal guards rushed out at this time, but fortunately, Dun Du's feet were slightly biased and hit the goal post, and Zhong Yuxiang overexerted himself and collided with the enemy army to fight for the ball, and his right finger joint was injured and left the field, and Yuyou played with ten people, but it did not affect its strength. Xiao Heitan raised the pole and rose to the occasion, crossing the border and building the road, and Cheng's former policy responded, and jointly attacked, and when he reached a considerable area, Xiao Xu lay on the ground and swept the ball, and Xiao Heitan was quick with his eyes and feet and returned,</p>
<p>Lancashire's Miserable Defeat With A Score of 3-1</p>
<p>At this point in the war, Lancashire's movements gradually became crude, and Zhong Yongshen was in danger of colliding with enemy general Dun Du, but fortunately the changes were understood and no disaster was caused. Enemy center Dun Du led his troops to invade the territory, and with the support of his two generals Xilikesi and Huo Huade, he invaded along the road with the force of a storm, and immediately fell into our army's defense line, Xiao Zhang lost his wits for a moment and was kicked in by Dun Du calmly, and the enemy army was happy and arrogant, and Yuyou was in danger. Fortunately, the entire army tried their best to prevent it and was able to turn the danger into safety. Yuyou was extremely peaceful and came out of the valley, and Zhong Yongshen ignored the gains and losses and went deep into the tiger's den alone, and it was actually achieved. The broadsword was released, and the enemy's gate was immediately trapped, laying the foundation for victory. After a while, the sound of the golden gong was sounded, and Yuyou returned in triumph with a score of 3-1,</p>

<p>In the Chinese Football Association's "Zhong" Division League, after the Qingguang team's old veterans withdrew, the battle for supremacy was narrowed to four strong teams (Missing, Guanghua, Fudan, and Zhenru). The Railway team, composed of elites from Jiaotong University, Lingnan University, and the Railway team itself, is no less strong than Guanghua. They previously drew with Zhenru and Guanghua, eager to determine who is best.</p>
<p>Fudan Takes the Lead</p>
<p>The match started at 3:00 PM, with Liu Chunshu as the referee. Fudan took the lead. After a tense standoff for several minutes, Fudan took advantage of the wind and rushed in, creating a dust storm. In the chaos, center Hu Zongyi scored a goal, opening the scoring. Stimulated by this, the Railway team was furious. Captain Liu Ximeng raised his arm and shouted, passing the ball to left-winger Lin Gendu. Lin Gendu swiftly and crisply kicked the ball, shooting against the wind. The ball flew like an arrow, and Zhou Dayun was unable to save it, resulting in a tie. Afterwards, the competition between the two sides intensified, with many exciting moments. As the first half was about to end, Railway's left fullback Shen Bingcong, due to his vision being obscured by the sun, accidentally hooked the ball into his own net, scoring an own goal. Fudan thus led 2-1 at the end of the first half.</p>
<p>Railway Declares Victory</p>
<p>After changing sides, the Railway team had the advantage of the wind, creating a one-sided situation. Fudan's defense was completely devastated. Although Guan Laoye tried his best to defend, he still missed a man. After making it 3-2, Fudan was demoralized, and Zhu Zhenhe and Liu Ximeng subsequently scored two goals each. The lineups of both teams are as follows:</p>

<p>Among them, the match between Shunji and Hongling in the Daode group was more important. In terms of group points, only this team had more. Shunji had all wins and one draw, Hongling had one draw and one abandonment, and the rest were also wins. If Hongling had won yesterday's match, their results would have been equal to Shunji's, and a final would have been required to determine the championship. Shunji's victory meant they won the championship directly without a final. Yesterday, Shunji overwhelmed Hongling with three goals, winning the championship without any problems. During the second half of the match, a certain player from Shunji was penalized and sent off the field by the referee for inappropriate behavior, while a certain player from Hongling expressed dissatisfaction with the referee and displayed disrespectful behavior, also resulting in a penalty dismissal by the referee. Afterwards, the Hongling team, due to their loss in the match, created additional complications and strongly blamed the referee, which damaged the team's spirit.</p>

<p>(Guangzhou Correspondent) Guangdong Province has been making every effort to promote compulsory education in recent years. According to statistics, the number of schools, students, and funding has increased sharply compared to the past. Just looking at the funding, the amount directly disbursed by the provincial education department has increased by more than 250,000 yuan, including 130,000 yuan from the central government and more than 100,000 yuan from the provincial government. The amount raised by the counties themselves is 510,000 yuan, totaling more than 750,000 yuan.</p>
<p>It is found that the distribution of this huge amount of funds is directly disbursed by the education department to subsidize impoverished counties in establishing 450 ordinary and short-term primary schools, totaling more than 140,000 yuan. Another 112,000 yuan is allocated to Guangzhou City to run compulsory education programs, and 24 first-class counties in the province each run 15 schools, totaling 216,000 yuan. 30 second-class counties each run 10 schools, totaling 207,000 yuan, and 20 third-class counties each run 3 schools, totaling 68,000 yuan.</p>
<p>It is heard that Huang Linshu, the director of the education department, will submit a report to the provincial government before the end of this semester to allocate another 500,000 yuan. Regarding how to allocate the additional funds, it is said that it will be properly determined after the provincial government makes a decision (February 25th).</p>

<h3 id="e166">Stabilizing the Bond Market and Controlling Foreign Exchange <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Xiong</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Finance has been implementing a policy of swapping public bonds. This policy is one of the meanings of last year's monetary reform and cannot be criticized in terms of meaning, as it is not based on public power. The main point of this bond swap is to completely unify all types of public bonds. In addition to unifying all public bonds in October, the Ministry also issued 340 million yuan of Reconstruction Public Bonds. Therefore, the amount of public bonds has increased sharply from 160 million yuan to 180 million yuan. The characteristic of the public bond market in the future is that public bonds are completely identical, with only slight differences in repayment periods. Since public bonds are unified and the guarantees and interest rates are equal, speculation and manipulation will be more difficult than before, so speculative practices are expected to be less prevalent than before. However, due to the complete unification of public bonds, the market prices will likely rise and fall in unison. Therefore, future fluctuations in public bond market prices will be spectacular. In the past, public bonds had different repayment periods, slightly different interest rates, and different guarantees, so market prices rose and fell at different times. Even if there were storms, they would not cause a complete disaster. Now that public bonds have been unified, market prices rise and fall completely in unison, and an unusual force is needed to stop them from rising or falling. The current amount of public bonds has reached 180 million, which is actually the largest investment in society. If the public bond market price cannot be kept stable, the financial market will be in turmoil for a long time. Therefore, how to stabilize the public bond market price is the most worthwhile issue to consider.</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Finance, part of the 200 million yuan of Reconstruction Public Bonds will be allocated to the market stabilization fund. The importance of maintaining the bond market is already in the plans of the authorities. We believe that the authorities may form a bond market stabilization committee to manage this. As for how to stabilize the bond market, the method must come from the common practice of purchasing public bonds when public bond prices fall, reducing the amount of public bonds circulating in the market, and stabilizing the market. When the public bond market price soars and speculation is excessive, public bonds are sold to prevent the market price from rising too high. This mechanical operation is actually what is called open market activity in various countries. If this function can be gradually developed, not only can the public bond market price be more stable, but also the prosperity of market financing can be adjusted. However, in our country at present, there are still some aspects that can be studied.</p>
<p>If a bank purchases public bonds, the other aspect is that the issuance of banknotes will increase, which is inevitable. However, the fluctuation of public bond market prices in our country is more affected by changes in the situation than by changes in the economy. It can be said that public bonds will rise and fall wildly when drastic changes occur in the domestic and foreign political situation. If public bonds rise and fall greatly,</p>
<p>If banks come out and make every effort to stabilize the bond market, with the current amount of debt already reaching 180 million, a large purchase is needed to maintain it. On the other hand, the issuance of banknotes by banks will suddenly expand in a short period of time, which will not only increase public panic, but also make bond market stability more difficult, and the foreign exchange rate may also face a crisis. When the situation changes and public bonds fall in price, it is also the time when funds most want to choose a way to escape. At this juncture, if banks increase the issuance of banknotes to accept public bonds, the general public will simply sell the public bonds to banks to obtain banknotes, and then turn around and purchase foreign exchange, so the foreign exchange will also face a crisis of fluctuation. At least part of the bank's foreign exchange reserves will be lost, which will weaken the bank's ability to stabilize foreign exchange. The result is that even if the public bonds are saved, the exchange rate will not be saved. This situation, especially when the international situation may deteriorate at any time, should be given special attention. If there is no effective remedy, then saving public bonds will be nothing more than a risk for the bank. Moreover, at the critical moment when a crisis occurs, if there is no guarantee method, the bank will not dare to actively stabilize the bond market for the sake of self-protection. The more active the activity, the more mobile funds there will be, and the more people who buy foreign exchange will be. The foreign exchange reserves will decrease more and more. This trend is actually more dangerous than the fall in public bond prices. Therefore, at a critical moment, it is best to make every effort to stabilize foreign exchange.</p>
<p>How to remedy this weakness? This is the center of the problem. The only way, we believe, is to actively prepare to block the road for funds to escape when necessary. Blocking the road for funds to escape will naturally involve the issue of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Since the monetary reform, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and other banks have been responsible for supplying foreign exchange without restriction. That is, regardless of the motive for a person to purchase foreign exchange, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and other banks are obligated to supply it. That is, the purchase of foreign exchange is completely free and unrestricted. In this way, the Bank of China and other banks have the responsibility to supply foreign exchange without restriction, while the society has the freedom to purchase foreign exchange without restriction. With the limited foreign exchange power of the Bank of China and other banks, supplying the unlimited foreign exchange needs of the entire country, Chinese and foreign, this situation is obviously not easy to maintain. Therefore, we believe that we should actively prepare to control foreign exchange at present, and at least the purchase of foreign exchange should be strictly restricted. We can say with certainty that maintaining stability, because only in this way can we be fearless in actively engaging in the public bond market.</p>
<h3 id="e167">World Silver Market and Chinese Currency <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Yusheng</p>
<p>In June 1934, the United States passed the Silver Purchase Act, turning silver into a political weapon in the global economy. The world silver market entered a new phase, with significant changes in silver prices and the volume of silver flow. The Chinese currency suffered unprecedented misfortune, forcing currency reform. Then, in December 1935, the United States changed its silver purchasing procedures, leading to a sharp drop in silver prices, and the silver market entered its second phase. China's silver flow and monetary system also underwent new international relationships. Now that the global silver tide has come to an end, what position will China's currency be in? This must be answered through practical research on the silver market.</p>
<p>(1) Changes in Silver Prices</p>
<p>After June 1934, the London silver price was completely controlled by the United States. Due to aggressive silver purchases by the United States, coupled with manipulation by London speculators, silver prices soared, from 20 pence per ounce in June to 36 pence per ounce in April 1935. At this time, the United States had become the sole buyer. Realizing that London's manipulation was excessive, it suddenly withdrew from the silver market during the settlement period, causing silver prices to fall rapidly, making it impossible for speculators to gain a foothold for a time. It was not until August 26 that the United States restored the silver price to 29 pence. From August to December 7, the London silver price changed very little, but when calculated against the exchange rate with China at that time, it was still 67% to 27% higher. Therefore, the outflow of Chinese silver did not stop, and international speculators still had active opportunities.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned London silver price, New York and Mumbai also announced silver prices daily. Before December 1935, the silver prices in the two locations maintained a parallel ratio with London. Before the start of silver purchases, the New York silver price was 45 cents per ounce, equivalent to 20 pence in London. The highest price was 81 cents in April, equivalent to 36 pence in London. After August, it stabilized at 65 cents, equivalent to 29 pence in London. After December 9 last year, New York became an actual trading market, breaking away from the chain of silver prices with London.</p>
<p>During this 18-month silver tide, the difference between the highest and lowest silver prices was the highest record in 15 years. Although the rate of silver price increase was far less than the 89 pence in 1910, the global impact caused by silver price fluctuations, and the use of silver standard countries as speculative tools, was a situation that could not have been imagined 15 years ago.</p>
<p>(2) Silver Flow</p>
<p>After June 1934, the largest buyer of silver - almost the only buyer - was the United States. The main supply of silver was in the East, and the transaction and concentration of silver had always been in London. Therefore, to study the world silver flow during this period, we only need to look at London's statistics to get a glimpse of the whole picture.</p>
<p>The scale of silver flow during this period was unprecedented. Before 1934, the highest was in 1932, when London's total import and export volume was 190 million ounces. However, only half a year after the implementation of the US Silver Purchase Act in 1934, the total amount increased to 282 million ounces, and in 1935 it increased to 685 million ounces. The following statistical table can indicate the direction of silver flow in 1935:</p>
<p>1935 London Silver Flow Table</p>
<p>(Unit: 100 Ounces)</p>
<p>Transcribed from Messrs Mocatta &amp; Goldsmid Annual Circular. The total import and export volume in the table is slightly less than the aforementioned 685 million ounces.</p>
<p>It is worth noting here that the United States was the largest silver buyer in 1935, and Japan and Hong Kong were the largest suppliers. It is found that Japan's annual silver production is only 7 million ounces, while its export volume exceeds its production by more than ten times. Hong Kong is a transit port, and there is no silver production to speak of. Where did their huge amounts of silver come from? Therefore, to study the truth about China's silver outflow during the panic period, we must refer to London's silver flow statistics.</p>
<p>In this environment, China's silver reserves decreased rapidly. According to statistics from Shanghai, the Shanghai silver reserves at the end of June 1934 were 58.2 million yuan, which was reduced to 33.4 million yuan before the currency reform, eventually becoming a major reason for our country's currency reform.</p>
<p>(3) China's Currency Reform and the World Silver Market</p>
<p>China was stimulated by the world silver tide, its finances were depleted, and industry and commerce declined. The government then announced a new monetary system on November 4, centralizing silver reserves, unifying issuance, suspending cash redemption, and stipulating that the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Bank would buy and sell foreign exchange without restriction to stabilize exchange rates. This news immediately affected the London silver market that day. Speculators expected that China would centralize silver reserves and that the world silver market would lack silver supply. The silver price rose from 19.3 pence to 19.5 pence. However, this expectation was soon clarified. China's silver supply continued, and stabilizing foreign exchange required exchanging silver. The silver price returned to its original state the next day. According to the British Economic Weekly, China later used high silver prices to sell silver in London. The silver price that previously disrupted China's finances now helped China's foreign exchange reserves. It was not until the United States changed its silver purchasing procedures that China changed its silver transport to New York. It must be stated incidentally that China's silver sales in London are not found in London's statistics. This requires further research.</p>
<p>Following China, Hong Kong reformed its currency system on November 9, issuing orders to ban silver exports and manage foreign exchange, but this was already expected in the London silver market, so it had no significant impact.</p>
<p>(4) The United States Changes Silver Purchasing Procedures</p>
<p>The United States initially launched its silver policy with resounding slogans: first, to increase the purchasing power of Eastern countries; second, to restore the silver standard monetary system for more than half of the world's population; and third, more profoundly and not openly proclaimed, to use it as a weapon of monetary warfare and establish the bimetallic system that the United States had long sought. By December 1935, these goals had tragically failed one by one. The 18-month silver tide forced China, Mexico, and Hong Kong to reform their currency systems, and reduced silver circulation in Italy, Spain, Australia, Peru, and other countries. Except for the United States and Abyssinia, the silver standard monetary system for more than half of the world's population no longer existed.</p>
<p>The silver policy effectively broke the monetary systems of weak countries, and conversely gave the enemies of the United States' monetary warfare opportunities to exploit. The influence of the pound sterling expanded, Japan gained unexpected benefits, and launched the North China Incident. The United States merely hoarded 775 million ounces of silver at a high price of 442 million US dollars, which was still very far from the originally planned gold-silver ratio of 3:1, let alone the gold-silver ratio of 16:1. At this point, the United States had to consider the serious situation at home and abroad, and changed its silver purchasing procedures. Starting from December 9, it gradually reduced the amount of silver purchased in London and switched to purchasing directly from silver-using countries and silver-producing countries. The silver price plummeted as a result. The London price fell from 29 pence on December 7 to 22 pence at the end of the month; the New York price fell from 65 cents on December 9 to 49 cents at the end of the month; the Mumbai price fell from 65 rupees on December 9 to 53 rupees at the end of the month. The world silver market was temporarily plunged into chaos, with London being the worst hit.</p>
<p>Initially, some people speculated that this move by the United States was a precursor to a change in monetary policy, and that the world's currencies would be plunged into even greater turmoil. In reality, it was only a shift from offense to defense by the United States, aimed at salvaging past failures and delivering a fierce blow to speculators. After this sharp drop in silver prices, China can reduce its silver outflows and at the same time change the direction of silver movement.</p>
<p>(5) The Current Situation of the World Silver Market</p>
<p>After the United States changed its silver purchasing procedures, the silver market entered its second stage. The New York silver market has surpassed London's. Silver from China, Mexico, and India is mostly shipped directly to New York. From December 9 of last year to February 14 of this year, the value of silver imported into the United States was more than 70 million US dollars, of which the value of silver purchased from London was more than 7 million pounds, equivalent to more than 30 million US dollars (it is impossible to accurately convert the price for a while), and the value of silver from China was 14.5 million US dollars. At the same time, the flow of silver in the London silver market decreased due to the reduction in silver purchases by the United States, as shown in the following table:</p>
<p>London Silver Flow Table Before and After the United States Changed Its Silver Purchasing Procedures Unit: Thousand Pounds</p>
<p>Compiled according to the British Economic Weekly</p>
<p>After carefully reviewing the above table, the state of silver flow before and after this action can be clearly understood. The first point to note here is that the input of silver in London after the change did not decrease, but the output decreased. One reason is that the silver volume transported to the United States declined; the second point is that the silver volume transported from Japan to London also gradually decreased, which was even more serious in the last two weeks. Hong Kong has a special relationship with the United Kingdom, so it increased instead. In short, the influence of the London silver market has gradually weakened, but London's qualification as an important world silver market will not be lost.</p>
<p>Turning from the flow of silver to the review of silver prices, after the change in the silver market, the silver prices in New York and London broke away from the chain relationship. New York directly posted prices without waiting for telegrams from London, while Mumbai roughly followed the silver prices in London. The most recent silver prices in the two places (according to Reuters) are listed below:</p>
<p>December 7, 1935 (Normal price before the silver market changed)</p>

<p>Pence Cents Rupees</p>

<p>It can be seen here that the period from December 7 to December 27 last year was a period of sharp decline in silver prices. In the two months from December 27 to the most recent, silver prices have gradually stabilized. In the last month (February), New York's silver price has stabilized at 44.79, and the fluctuations in silver prices in London and Mumbai are also very small. In the past few days, the London silver market has been buying a lot by Indian merchants, and there is no sign of further decline in the market price.</p>
<p>Silver Price Prospects and Chinese Currency</p>
<p>The current silver price has temporarily stabilized, but how long can this be maintained? This is a difficult question to answer. According to an analysis by US financial groups, as a kind of understanding measurement, the silver market experts abroad judge that silver prices will not fall excessively in the future, and that the decline below 20 pence will be very slow, because the period of struggle for silver as a political tool has passed, and it will reappear as a commodity. As a commodity, it must maintain a price ratio with other related commodities. From historical statistical research, the silver price should be maintained at around 20 pence. This statement has been insightful in the London silver market situation for the past two months. Although the amount of silver purchased by the United States in London has gradually decreased, the silver price has remained between 21.75 and 19 pence from December 20 to the most recent, which shows that the commodity nature of silver has been established and the world silver market has become quite clear. However, two conditions must be paid attention to. First, if the US silver policy suddenly changes and a huge amount of silver is released, then this statement will not hold. Second, the stability of silver's commodity nature is not permanent. In terms of commodity nature, silver is not as good as nickel. Silver used as decoration will undergo chemical reactions, and silver production is not like other minerals, which can stop mining when supply exceeds demand. Silver is a byproduct and cannot be restricted. Therefore, the final price of silver cannot be measured by historical price ratios.</p>
<p>However, according to the current situation, the judgment that silver prices will no longer fall excessively is credible. Then, what impact will this have on China's currency? On the surface, the stability of silver prices will make overseas silver prices still more than 10% higher than domestic silver prices, then the problem of China's silver outflow will not be completely eliminated in the future. The government's control policies will hardly collect all the silver in the country, nor will it be able to cope with the erosion of certain foreign forces. Will the stability of silver prices harm China's monetary system? This is not the case. We should recognize that the current key to China's monetary problem is not the silver problem, but the foreign exchange problem and the management problem. Smuggling is no longer enough to destroy the new monetary system, and the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Bank's insistence on buying and selling foreign exchange without restriction is the key. Therefore, the Chinese people can observe the government's recent silver sales with a calm eye. The stability of silver prices is giving China's currency a chance to gradually consolidate.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Review of Last Year's Silver Price Fluctuations <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Juzeng</p>
<p>Last year's (1935) silver market fluctuations were the most significant since the ninth year of the Republic (1920). The highest peak reached 36 and a quarter pence, owing to the elimination of the world's silver standard and the disorganization of the silver market.</p>
<p>As for the monthly silver market fluctuations throughout last year, they can be seen in the table below.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, the spot price of silver in London was 24.625, and the forward price was 24.75. During January, the market price fluctuated slightly. At that time, the United States had just satisfied its absorption of any surplus silver and did not exert pressure. While Indian speculators were buying, China was selling. Although the economic difficulties of a major property company threatened currencies in the late month, it had little impact on silver prices. In addition, the American Supreme Court's judgment on gold bar transactions had not yet been determined, so the market was very quiet during the first two weeks of January. However, starting from the 14th, due to a sudden need from speculators, the market price gradually rose from the previous day's 24.4375 to 25.6875 on the 28th. During this period, China's equalization fund had made large purchases; the Indian government also announced at the end of the month that the silver import tax was reduced from five annas to two annas. Market price changes in March were more complex, partly due to the movement of the pound-dollar exchange rate. The main changes occurred between the 22nd and 26th. Because speculators heard that the US Senate had passed Thomas's amendment to the work relief bill, believing that the government would greatly expand the silver purchasing program, they scrambled to buy, so the market price rose by 1.6875. The case was immediately overturned by the House of Representatives, and as a result, the silver price fell by 0.4335. At that time, the US government was buying, China was selling, and speculators in India and London were varying in their buying and selling, so the market situation did not change. In the first week of April, the news of US silver purchases was quiet, and the market price remained below 28.5. On the 9th, the US government resumed purchases, which triggered new buying in China and India. As a result, the market price rose to 28.9375 on the 10th. On the same day, the US government also increased the domestic silver price from US$0.645 to US$0.7111, so the market price rose by 2.379 from the 10th to the 12th to 31.3125. Below this level, many appeared to be profiting, and the sellers of various Chinese banks were quite substantial, so the market price returned to 30.75. After Easter, various parties were confused by the various declarations of the silver group, and those engaged in this business in the East bought unlimitedly at a high price, so the market price rose from 30.9375 on the 18th to 36.25 on the 26th, which was the highest record of the year. On the 24th, the US government increased the domestic silver price from US$0.7111 to zero, US$0.7757, which was equal to 35 pence in London, while the official market price in the British capital was 32.8125. Moreover, there were rumors in the United States that the domestic silver price would gradually increase to US$1.29, and the difference between the world silver price and it would not be very far at that time. This stimulated buying, and buyers were even willing to offer up to 37 pence on the afternoon of April 26.</p>
<p>At that time, Mexico was very worried about this situation and urgently appealed to Washington, believing that if all the currency of the country was absorbed out of the country, the harm would be immeasurable; because the United States continued to implement the policy of raising silver prices, it would drive all the silver in the countries still using the silver standard out of the country, as the US silver purchasing program would be completed one day, leading to this. Subsequently, the United States announced a ban on the import of silver coins, and added an interpretation the next day, the market price fell by .75 to 32.9375. It was then learned that the silver purchasing bill was not related to this, and the market price returned to 33.5625 at the end of the month. At this time, the US government was not very active in the silver market, so transactions were limited to speculation. On June 4, it fell by one pence, and the US Treasury Department began to join the buyers. On the 19th, it fell by another half a pence, and India sold a lot, and transactions were very active. This sale of Indian silver, as well as the supply from Chinese and London speculators, continued until the end of the month. However, the purchasing power of the United States was not strong, so the market price gradually fell to 30 pence.</p>
<p>Earlier, when the market price fluctuated between 36.25 and 32.375 at the turn of April and May, the long positions that were operating were all due in late June and early July. Investors were unwilling to settle the swap for two months. Therefore, on the morning of July 5 (Saturday), India sold a lot and scrambled to settle, and the market price was almost out of control. The broker's market price only fell slightly by 0.3125 to 30.6875, and the US government purchased 10 million ounces at this price. In the following days, it once returned to outside, until August 10, there was no change. The transactions were quiet, and there were occasional speculators engaged in settlement, and the only buyer was the US government.</p>
<p>On August 12, the market situation changed again, and by the 15th it had fallen from 30.1875 to 29 pence. At that time, the US Treasury Department lowered the price by 0.0625, probably because of the soft entanglement of the US rest exchange rate. This caused a huge amount of selling in China and India, and the volume of transactions exceeded the previous records of the year. According to Washington, the US government purchased 25.5 million ounces of silver in London on the 14th alone. The spot market price on the 15th added .0625, which was the first time since August 10, 1934. Since then, until December 7, the US government has not changed the US dollar purchase price. The fluctuations in the London market price were only limited to the rise and fall of the erratic exchange rate. At that time, the US government continued to absorb spot silver supplied from various places, and Hong Kong was the main seller. On August 23, the spot market price suddenly rose to 29.14375, and the futures price was 29.375, but this was only because of the temporary need for forward placements in China and India, and the spot market price was only slightly affected. When the need disappeared, the selling trend returned. In early October, with the outbreak of the Italo-Ethiopian War, the British exchange rate weakened, and speculators once needed it. The spot market price rose to 29.625 on the 5th, and the futures price was 29.75, but it changed to 29.3115 on the 17th. Until November 22, the US purchase price remained unchanged. Then, as the US demand gradually decreased, and Hong Kong and other places continued to abandon, this price was reduced by 0.4375 on November 2.</p>
<p>At the same time, China's financial finance was increasingly disturbed by the impact of the US silver purchasing program. The Shanghai exchange rate was one shilling, six and sixty-eighths pence on October 1, and fell to one shilling, two and seven-eighths pence on November 2. The Hong Kong exchange rate also showed the same change. On November 4, the central government announced the abandonment of the silver standard, the adoption of currency management, the nationalization of silver, and the fixing of the currency value at one shilling, two and a half pence. The banknotes of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Bank were used as legal tender to replace silver dollars. The Hong Kong government also followed suit by banning silver exports, but this move had little impact on the entire silver market except for curbing Chinese silver sales. On December 5, the Hong Kong government abandoned the silver standard, and all measures were the same as those implemented by China in mid-November. For the next two days, the silver market seemed indifferent to it. But on the 9th, due to the sudden change of hands in the United States, London brokers did not reach an agreement with the US authorities until the afternoon to suppress the market price by 0.4375. The next day, a huge amount of silver was sold, but the buyers were silent, and the market price could not be determined. This situation was something that had not been seen since the outbreak of the European War in July of the 3rd year of the Republic (1914). Since then, the silver market has not had any overdue transactions. As for the market price, it fell from 29.1875 on the 7th to 20.875 on the 24th. Fortunately, the December transactions were still able to be settled safely, which was still satisfactory.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to describe the situation of US silver purchases in London. From mid-August to the beginning of December, the US authorities sent daily silver purchase entrustment forms to the British capital, with a clear understanding that the London market price must not be stipulated below the US silver price. At that time, the British side firmly adhered to this. Until the first week of December, the United States changed to buying silver elsewhere, and the quantity purchased from London was less than that purchased elsewhere. This sudden change of policy plunged the silver market into chaos for a while. When US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau issued a statement, explaining the reason why the United States changed its policy, the situation became a little clearer. The first thing was to reject the general speculators, because these people used the purchases of the United States as the basis for transactions. But the most important thing that prompted the United States to change its policy was that China abandoned the silver standard.</p>
<p>According to statistics, the United States purchased nearly 390 trillion ounces of silver in the British capital last year, an increase that cannot be underestimated compared with the 86 trillion in 1934. At the end of 1934, the United States had gold reserves of approximately 8,238,000,000 yuan. Silver was calculated at 1.29 yuan per ounce. According to estimates, the United States should purchase at least 1,596 trillion ounces of silver in order to obtain 25% of the silver reserves to stand against 75% of the gold reserves. However, in 1935, the United States still absorbed a lot of gold, so the ratio naturally increased accordingly. The numbers of gold and silver reserves in the United States last year are as follows (unit: million):</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that although the United States purchased a huge amount of 470 trillion ounces of silver last year, the amount it used to offset the difference was only 180 trillion ounces, and it happened to be in a year when many selling households were tied up, and it was still unable to satisfy its desires; however, recently (February 22, 1936) Washington telegrams stated that the leader of the silver faction has given up any hope of further raising the status of silver in this session of Congress; because on the one hand, the inflation faction is eager to inflate the currency, on the other hand, the US Treasury Department lacks interest in raising silver prices, and on the third hand, the prices of metals such as copper, aluminum, and zinc cannot be raised for one day, then the mining of US silver mines is naturally difficult to be profitable, and even if there is any bill, it will be in vain, so general observations also believe that silver is no longer an important issue.</p>
<p>As for last year, the Indian government sold 20 trillion ounces of silver; Russia sold 16 trillion ounces; Portugal seems to have stopped buying silver, and there was not much buying and selling in other countries in mainland China, but the silver exported by Japan accounted for as much as 85.5 trillion ounces. Seven ounces of this were produced from Japanese silver mines, and most of the rest was smuggled from China.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) The sources from various regions yesterday were relatively abundant, with over thirty dealers arriving (totaling over 7,000 piculs). However, the sales in this area were sluggish. Dealers from Qingdao and other regions only took about three to four hundred packages of thick japonica rice and over a thousand packages of thin indica rice. Therefore, the market situation turned weak. As a result, the price of thick early japonica rice fell slightly by five cents, and the price of thin indica rice depreciated by ten cents. The price of She Yang sharp rice has not yet been determined, and there was not much fluctuation in the price of Yinbian glutinous rice.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were twenty-seven or twenty-eight sources from various routes downstream of the river. The white japonica rice shops on the market were weak, and there was a lack of transactions in the countryside. The market price of high-grade rice barely held up but eventually weakened by a few cents. The retail sales of thin indica rice were normal, and the price trend was slightly weak. The sales of white glutinous rice were also sluggish, and the price also weakened by a few cents. The market conditions for Yangjian and Dubujian rice were weak, and the price of customer-specified rice was stable. The prices of other goods were slightly soft.</p>

<p>Someone told me, "The taste of a cigarette is best when it's just lit, and when it's about to burn your lips. When it's just lit, the smoke is mellow, and there seems to be a bit of sweetness on the tongue. When it's about to burn your lips, you feel like there's still some taste left over. The most boring part is the middle section, tasteless to eat, a pity to discard."</p>
<p>Someone told me that to write a great article, the beginning must have a few earth-shattering sentences to grab the reader's attention. So, if the beginning of a writing does not have an astonishing opening, it should be discarded and rewritten. At the end of the full text, one also needs to concentrate on using an odd pen to complete it in one breath, so that the reader pats the table and calls it excellent. The middle section is always sloppy, so reading the article the most tasteless part is the middle section.</p>
<p>Someone told me, "In a 10,000-meter race, the first few hundred meters are extremely important, because being at the front at the beginning has the momentum of gaining the upper hand. After 9,000 meters, the trophy is already in sight, and at this time, everyone knows in their feet that they cannot relax. In the middle, although it may not be tense, it is still a bit different. Therefore, to watch a 10,000-meter race, it is enough to watch only the beginning and the end."</p>
<p>Someone told me, "The most inspiring thing about separation is the beginning and the end. At the station, there are always some reluctant farewells, especially the separation of young men and women, with some even weeping. But when the separation ends and they reunite, the tension of their emotions is naturally difficult to describe. In between these two distances, there will inevitably be the pain of being in two places, but in retrospect, all the sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy flavors seem to be only in the two periods of separation and reunion." Someone told me, "The taste of being newly married is really good." Someone also told me, "The taste of growing old together is really good." But among middle-aged couples, at least six or seven out of ten are at odds with each other, arguing every three days and making a scene every four days.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Cultivation Method of Potted Plum Blossoms (Part 2) <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Chuyu</p>
<p>Eradicating Pests</p>
<p>Plum blossoms have many pests. For example, scale insects easily breed on tender leaves. Leaves infested by scale insects will curl up. When you see them, you can pour insecticide on them. But the most frightening thing for potted plum blossoms is the larvae of plum moths. These insects specialize in eating plum buds. After the plum buds sprout in the spring, they are almost completely eaten. The insect's body is four to five fen long. Its back is dark brown, its abdomen is red, and it is similar in color to the bark of the plum tree. It has short hairs and yellow stripes. It lurks between the branches and trunks of the plum tree, or in the middle of the bark. When the weather warms up in the spring, it becomes very active. It is often harmed by these insects, causing the plum blossom to wither and die. The mature pupae of these insects are from late April to early May. By early June, they turn into moths and fly to the plum leaves to lay eggs. When there are leaves, they eat the leaves. After the leaves fall, they gnaw on the bark. When the buds sprout, they specialize in eating the buds. Therefore, when the plum leaves grow in the autumn, you must carefully check the leaf surface. Once pests are discovered, use insecticide to eliminate them to prevent them from breeding. There is also a kind of core insect. This insect specializes in eating tender buds when the new shoots elongate in early summer. It is extremely small and is a green, slender beetle. There is also a kind of plum lice, which lies on the leaves. It looks like millet. After the plum leaves are infested by this insect, the front of the leaves turns into white light spots. Ordinary insecticides will not kill them. Sulfur mixture must be used to drive them away. These insects specialize in sucking the nutrients in the leaves, which is very harmful. Plum lovers should pay special attention to this.</p>
<p>Plum Sapling Propagation Method</p>
<p>Plum blossoms are propagated in three ways: seedling cultivation, grafting, and cutting. Potted plum blossoms, if seedling cultivated, can live for eighteen to twenty years. Grafting requires specialized skills. Cutting and seedling cultivation takes several years before they can be transplanted into pots for cultivation. The cutting method is best done around the spring equinox, but it varies depending on the region. Generally, cutting when the flowers have fallen and the leaf buds are gradually expanding is easier to survive. The cuttings should be from last year's new shoots, and they should be selected from those that have been fully exposed to sunlight, with branches that are long and curved. Cut them into five or six inches long, and cut the cut with a sharp knife in one stroke, so that the cut is not crushed. If you use scissors to crush it, it will rot and will not germinate. Also, if the plum cutting is too short, it will not easily survive, and the roots that grow will be poor. The seedling bed for cuttings should be made of soil with a lot of red earth, and it should not have water accumulation. The soil should be three or four inches deep. If you make a seedling bed in the corner of the garden, you can first dig the soil one or two feet deep, repeatedly digging it up, so that the soil is soft. Mix red earth and sand on top to make the water easily penetrate and maintain appropriate humidity. After cutting, it will grow one or two feet tall by autumn. By the spring of the second year, you can prune it to your liking and replant it, but you should fertilize it fully this year. Generally, it is expected to bloom after three years. If the cutting method is correct, it is better than grafting, because the grafting interface often expands, which is very unsightly. Cutting is the same as seedling cultivation, which can avoid this shortcoming.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Four: Greed Over Beauty, The Vulgar Man Reluctantly Gives Up; Ambition High, The Strong Man Walks Away</p>
<p>Hai laughed and said, "Mr. Cheng, you may have misunderstood my meaning. If I had the ability, I wouldn't talk about marriage issues. I would just take out a sum of money and save his family of three." Zhiqian said, "Precisely because the money issue has passed, now it is just a matter of love." Beihai was sitting close to the table, turned his face to look at the newspaper on the table, and took it up, holding it with both hands to read. Zhiqian, seeing that he did not respond, peeked at him and saw that the newspaper he was holding was still shaking a little. He was laughing too hard from the bottom of his heart. So he laughed and said, "I tell you, you can take advantage of this qualification as an intermediary for selling land to earn a sum of marriage money from it." Beihai did not reply to this sentence, and exclaimed, "The newspaper published such a large section about Old Jia's matter, fortunately it did not publish his name." Zhiqian said, "Exclaim what? It's another great bargain for you. Leaving a line of retreat like this, you want Old Jia to ease up in all aspects. You are one side of this matter, and he has to perfunctorily deal with you. As long as he is willing to perfunctorily deal with you, you can proceed." Beihai didn't say anything, pressed the newspaper on his lap, raised his head and looked out the window, just smiling in a daze. At this moment, he saw Sister-in-law Hu rushing towards him with her small steps, stumbling and falling as she passed by the window. After a while, she began to complain in Zhang Jiefu's room. She said, "We didn't ask those madams to interfere. The girl has only been married for a few days, and they want to send her back. Isn't that a big joke? With those hundred or so dollars, how many days can I support his family of three? Please ask Old Master Zhang to tell Old Master Jia to take the child back." Then he heard Zhang Jiefu say, "What does it have to do with Old Master Jia that Madam Lan wants to rescue this girl?" Sister-in-law Hu also said, "This Madam Lan also says she is a noble person, but she doesn't know the slightest bit about the three obediences and four virtues. How can a girl return to her mother's house after only being married for a few days? Although my Hu family is poor, we are not that ignorant. If she wants to go back, she can go to another house to rest. My house cannot keep her." Cheng Zhiqian then whispered to Beihai with a smile, "Look, here comes another difficult problem. His aunt won't let him go back, and Little Western Paradise can't keep him." Hokkaido said, "Isn't he doing well in Madam Lan's house now?" (409)</p>

<h3 id="e178">Impressions of the Soviet Print Exhibition <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Jinhao</p>
<p>The painting of the Soviet Union for the socialist reality is exhibiting new content and new technology.</p>
<p>In the Second Soviet Print Exhibition in China held by the Youth Association, I met Beihong.</p>
<p>"Their performances are indeed real. Of course, we also need imagination, but it must be based on reality..." he said to me like this.</p>
<p>However, their reality shows differences in subject matter and technology because of the difference between social life and capitalist countries.</p>
<p>The people of the Soviet Union, because of their fighting power, have gradually turned from hearing to nature, because artists who have become a special class have been transformed into common life-longers of the people, because individuals have broken away from all traditional viewpoints. With the restraint, the skills are freely developed. Therefore, they are separated from the current art world of various countries, and the wonderful flowers that are different from the crowd grow.</p>
<p>The reason why woodcuts have achieved results in the Soviet Union is because in that society full of vitality, there is a need for such simple and powerful works to satirize, inspire, and stimulate the general public. Like "Essays" with a sense of battle, they are advanced artistic sketches.</p>
<p>Here, in addition to woodcuts, some watercolors, pencils, monotype, and ink colors aroused my greater attention.</p>
<p>Technically, the overall movement of various painting tools has broken through the difficulties of single tools in expression. This technique of abandoning traditional expression methods has obviously achieved a high degree of success. They not only use brushes, but also use pencils, pens, and even engraving knives at the same time. As long as it is convenient to paint, various techniques can be adopted without being restricted by a certain range. This is the true victory of creative needs. Like the wounded bird made by Bato using the monotype painting method, the wings of a bird struggling with misfortune and the feathers of each part, the precise brush strokes cannot be drawn by simple oil painting or watercolor. Furthermore, the mechanization of bridge construction made by Lei Te also uses steel pens and watercolors at the same time. The crane on the shore of the Nepalese River made uses pencil lines in addition to watercolor. This painting method adapts to today's improved printing technology.</p>
<p>In spirit, we cannot see the themes of enjoyment or worry there. What they draw are some lively, heavy, and fighting expressions. For example, the football made by Antonov expresses the lively and healthy life of Soviet teenagers. The Cultural Rest Park made by Kashinga expresses the entertainment of the Soviet people, and at the same time instills healthy cultural knowledge. In particular, many descriptions of mechanical engineering, such as the construction of the Nepalese river water gate and the installation of boilers made by Dolmichetoff, and the preparation for the launch of wooden boats in the shipyard made by Pavloff, etc., show the Soviet Union's socialistic construction movement. The active and diligent, and the general public’s clear understanding of this kind of work and deep interest make the artists who are pioneers integrated into this kind of life, truly sincerely and powerfully write realistically on a wide range, and become encouraging and promoting This kind of painting that grasps great historical traces gives the public the excitement to step up their efforts.</p>
<p>However, this kind of painting cannot and cannot be produced in other countries where the air is full of economic panic, the disease of depression and pain is prevalent, the labor of the labor is ignored, and the artistic writers do not have this kind of real feeling. Only in the Soviet Union, where the Five-Year Plan has been successfully completed and is continuing, and only in the Soviet Union, where class status has been eliminated and all the people have become a whole creative force, does Tao have this victorious condition.</p>
<p>There are also many portraits, landscapes, illustrations, and historical sounds, etc., which are vigorous, magnificent, relaxed, and solemn, but each is full of vitality, and they are all very precious.</p>

<p>— (Du Yaguang)</p>
<p>Why do we humans have childhood, youth, adulthood, and old age? And in these periods, although it is the same me, why do the appearance and form change? The reason for this is entirely because the "metabolism" of cells changes our appearance. According to physiological calculations, the metabolism of the human body is only seven years, and the whole body must be replaced, but the changes are gradual and subtle, so we are not aware of it.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Identification of Birdcages <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Keeping birds in cages is like keeping beauties in golden houses. The size and height of the cage must be configured according to the bird's weaving skills. There are things that cannot be confused. One famous cage maker is Mr. Du of Kunshan, known as Du's cage. Mr. Du was born during the Tongzhi period of the former Qing Dynasty. The cages he made were elegant and not vulgar, which was difficult for writers to achieve. However, after the Red Goat Fire, there are no more left in the market. In the early years of Guangxu, Mei Fenglin's yellow-headed cage in Changshu was also very famous. This cage is suitable for keeping spotted-necked birds, and people scramble to buy it. The Wang cage imitated by Mr. Wang of Fushan only gets its appearance, but it is not as good as it. Zhou Zaichen and his son made twisted silk, ice plum carved flower white-eye cages, which only flaunted their fine carvings and were not worth mentioning. The best of these products should be the Zhifu cage. Zhifu, surnamed Yao, is a native of Wujun. He has a great love for white-eye birds, so he made his own gold wire bamboo cages. The step bow of the cage wire eyes is different in each section, which people cannot imitate. It is a pity that only a few cages were made, and it is difficult to buy them with a lot of money. I heard that Mr. Jiang of Xishan has a Zhifu cage, accompanied by Ling Jushi's hook, ancient kiln jar, and green mother-son pieces. It is ancient and extraordinary. Mr. Jiang regards it as a treasure, and people also see it and sigh with envy. Nowadays, the market is flooded with Jin Sanwei's gold wire cages, which are inferior to the previous ones.</p>

<p>— Xie Yun</p>
<p>It was early spring, and the mild sun shone on my body, warming me and making me sleepy. Wearing a cotton robe, I felt a little hot.</p>
<p>The pool of water in front of the building was so lovely with its blue hue. A group of brown ducks floated and sank in the water, swimming back and forth, often submerging their beaks into the water, wagging their tails, and splashing water up and down to wash their bodies. They quacked and chased each other, playing happily. The ripples on the water surface expanded in circles, shaking the reflections of the tree branches in the water, like countless golden snakes wriggling, their shapes extremely happy. The willow branches on the shore were still shaking in the wind, and the shadows of the branches were reflected in the pool, as if they were ashamed and complained about the late arrival of the spring breeze.</p>
<p>Spring has come, and this group of happy ducks was the first to throw themselves into its embrace.</p>

<p>— Linghu Zhao</p>
<p>When Mr. X, a teacher at a certain school in Wuxing, was marking students' papers, he discovered that a certain "article formula" was commonly used throughout the grade. That is: "Man is born into the world, oh people; from this perspective, is it not so!"</p>
<p>Mr. X could not help but burst into thunder, warning the students: "From now on, if anyone violates this formula in the paper, they must redo it. Those who violate it again will be punished ten times with Xia Chu, and a major demerit will be recorded." The whole school was in an uproar, and Mr. X had no choice but to leave his seat and go elsewhere.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Zhu Chengnian's Thief <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Jiawei</p>
<p>According to reports, in a certain lane in Henan Road, Zhabei, there is an empty house that has been sealed by the court. Unexpectedly, one night, a big hole was dug in the wall of the house by a thief, and many things were stolen and moved out. After the North Station Detective Team successively arrested a large number of thieves related to the case, the oldest was only fifteen years old, one person; the remaining three were only thirteen years old, all underage children. One of the receivers of stolen goods was also only eighteen years old. They have now been sent to the General Bureau for disposal.</p>
<p>Illegal incidents involving theft and robbery are, in today's riddled social organization, occurring every day and are on the rise! Isn't it obvious? In the past, there were college students in Shanghai who became thieves and went to jail, and college students in Hangzhou who became robbers and were executed...etc., have become commonplace.</p>
<p>However, among these unscrupulous people who "take without regard for righteousness," I am afraid that most of them are driven by life and oppressed by the economy to take risks, right? Of course, others, like the "idlers who do not engage in proper business" produced in today's social environment, which is a mixture of ancient feudal remnants and corrupt capitalist civilization residue, is also the inevitable next best thing!</p>
<p>However, these are all young and middle-aged people who have reached adulthood. We rarely hear about those thirteen or fourteen-year-old children who plan to commit theft in groups like the ones mentioned above (of course, it is common to see children stealing a pancake or an orange from a vendor's stall; but they will never be as "mature" as these children, right?)</p>
<p>Here, of course, some people will again attribute it to the bankruptcy of today's education. That's right. However, we cannot completely ignore the relationship between education and society, as well as the fundamental reasons for its bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Isn't that right? How long have the cries of "Save the children!" been going on? But what enlightenment has this incident given us?</p>
<p>The "compulsory education" that has been sung for a long time, and even the "compulsory education" that has been implemented for more than half a year, their achievements are probably only these, right?</p>
<p>Sure enough, every week, more cinemas are showing "children's education films," right? However, how many of the films shown have even a little bit of "educational" meaning? Moreover, what is the relationship between these films and street urchins who make a living by stealing?</p>
<p>Well, in short, everything, no matter how great, is ultimately inseparable from this cage of society, right?!</p>
<p>So, if we want to cry "Save the children!", where should we start? Let's all work hard!</p>

<p>— Shen Wu</p>
<p>Dusk. We really are about to leave. Old Man Zhu muttered to himself for a while, saying that chasing crows early in the morning brings bad luck to children; he also trembled about not accumulating good deeds and that one shouldn't harm living creatures casually: killing living beings... This old man, as usual, trembled for a while, then silently packed his belongings, went to burn incense for the Goddess of Mercy, and chanted spells.</p>
<p>This time, the procession was truly impressive. A dozen or so spears, plus Old Yan's and Old Mo's two short guns, marched mightily towards the mountain path. Old Ge rode Hu Datou's jujube horse, straightened his back, and escorted our team, looking even more imposing. The children in the village stared at us with curious eyes until the shadow of the village gradually receded from us.</p>
<p>After passing two steep mountain peaks, bizarre rocks were scattered all over the mountain path, and the weeds grew so tall that they sometimes blocked the way ahead. The mountain path was rugged, making it very difficult to walk. Once we reached the mountain bend, Old Yan's imposing manner had diminished by more than half. He no longer escorted the rear of the team, but gradually squeezed into the middle of the crowd. We were all silent, focusing only on walking along the mountain path.</p>
<p>The sky gradually darkened. The sun sank below the horizon, and the red glow of the sky was reflected in the mountains, creating beautiful mountain scenery. However, this fleeting dusk mountain scenery was quickly swallowed by darkness. Walking in the dark mountains made us feel even more difficulty. Someone turned on a flashlight, and a beam of white light shone brightly, but Old Yan immediately scolded them down. So everyone had to continue groping, stumbling along the rugged mountain path, with boundless darkness ahead.</p>
<p>The mountain path sometimes rose and sometimes fell. Those walking in the vanguard often stumbled several times. This time, after turning a bend in the mountain, the path became low-lying again, the surrounding weeds were very tall, and the rocks were very jagged. The people in the vanguard suddenly fell down, and couldn't get up for a while, as if someone had rolled down. Old Song turned on the flashlight and shone it around, and it seemed that several ropes were stretched across the mountain road. Old Yan was shouting loudly from behind, telling them not to turn on the flashlight. Before the shout stopped, several cold rifle shots rang out. Old Song sensitively turned off the flashlight, Old Yan panicked and didn't know what to do; the horse neighed, and Old Man Zhu also became flustered...</p>
<p>The gunshots became more and more numerous and gradually intensified. Our dozen or so spears finally reached the peak, leaving only a few carrying poles and a horse on the mountain path. However, we couldn't find the enemy's target, so we just fired back a few shots randomly, resisting the enemy's flames.</p>
<p>In the midst of the intense gunfire, someone cried out miserably. The sound was very close to us, and we couldn't help but be startled. Our hearts began to beat strangely. Gradually, in the firelight, we discovered that the enemy had formed an encirclement. Everyone hid between the grass and the rocks, firing back. The gunfire became more and more intense, and the cries of the people became even more tragic. But suddenly we heard the enemy's gunfire gradually fade away, and finally, after coldly answering a few shots, it stopped.</p>
<p>Old Song immediately walked down the mountain path from the shelter of the rocks and shone the flashlight in the direction of the cries. The horse had disappeared. Old Man Zhu lay slowly on the ground, a pool of blood flowing from his thigh. Old Yan was huddled in a ball among the weeds in the mountain bend...</p>
<p>We helped Old Man Zhu up, and someone found some wild yams in the mountains to apply to his wound. He gasped and murmured, "Not accumulating good deeds?... Chasing crows early in the morning!... It's unlucky!... I always said: the children don't listen..."</p>
<p>We didn't say anything, just remained silent. The mountains were still filled with boundless darkness and coldness. The night was still long.</p>

<p>There has been a major riot in Japan, with many important figures being victimized. Tan Laosan said that internal changes were bound to occur in Japan, which was long expected by us. However, he did not expect the situation to be so serious. Now, let's wait and see what the results and impacts will be. I will put on my old glasses to observe.</p>
<p>During the student unrest in Beiping and Tianjin, a total of 107 students were arrested in Beiping. Tan Laosan said, "It's a pity that one person is missing. If one more person were added, it would exactly form the number of the 36 Heavenly Spirits and the 72 Earthly Fiends. How unjust!"</p>

<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>Occasionally, I stay overnight at a friend's house. The bedroom faces a road. After we're tired of talking and go to sleep, the lights are turned off, and the neon lights on the storefronts on both sides of the road combine to create a colorful light and shadow that flows into the room and is reflected on a painted screen mirror. Seeing this faint and dazzling light and shadow, my heart feels as if it's touched by a slight electric current, and a kind of unspeakable bewilderment floats up; to put it lightly, it's a kind of melancholy feeling, right? I have a habit of disliking beds, so I expected I wouldn't be able to sleep well tonight. However, I don't get annoyed by this. I often feel that insomnia isn't necessarily a painful but delightful thing: half a bed of warm mattress, a long and silent night, allowing people to travel between heaven and earth, east, south, west, and north, creating all kinds of strange and magnificent dreams, or chewing on the traces of joy and sorrow in the process of life. It's much more interesting than falling asleep as soon as one touches the mat. These are all leisure activities that are not easy to enjoy in the midst of the busy daily life.</p>
<p>It's almost midnight. Dazzled by the light and shadow outside the building, although I've taken off my outer clothes, I haven't gone to bed yet. Leaning against a glass window, I crane my neck to look down. On the oily asphalt ground, cars flow past like mercury. The lights shine on the shiny car armor, reflecting a dazzling light. In an instant, it slides past, faintly leaving a shock, with the smell of gasoline floating in the air. This stream flows past, flows back, and weaves into a kind of bustling and noisy sound. It turns out that not far ahead, the tall building that shines in the night sky is a certain dance hall, and this time is when gentlemen and ladies are driving to the banquet. For the past half year, I've mostly lived in the suburbs. I've gradually become unfamiliar with the atmosphere of the city at night. When I lived in the suburbs, I was also in a small building overlooking a village road. Midnight there was only a desolate calmness. Occasionally, a passing pedestrian walks on the fine sand road with a monotonous pace, or there is an unnatural cough, which causes several long dog barks, making people feel that this is completely a remote mountain village, and it never occurs to them that just a few miles away, there is a bustling and luxurious area. In addition, there is the sound of the hawker selling wontons in the wind and rain, slowly and leisurely striking, walking past the door, also with a very strong medieval tone, a kind of peaceful and leisurely fun full of hypnotic qualities, with no trace of erotic stimulation mixed in. I have no love or aversion for such a realm. However, I'm feeling a bit unfamiliar to the erotic bewilderment of the city at night, but after all, I have a sense of intimacy and fusion. Even if I have insomnia, I can only blame it on my habit of disliking beds. This is not a sophism.</p>
<p>Therefore, I feel that the loveliness of Shanghai, which makes people fascinated, is all due to the obvious and strong erotic stimulation woven in the night. If there were no bright and gorgeous lights in the night, adjusting the noisy city sounds and appearances, and the world turned dark and silent at night, even if the daytime was bustling with traffic and noise all day long, it would lose its meaning of prosperity. Living in Shanghai, if you only see the hustle and bustle of the day and do not appreciate the light, color, sound, and interest of the night, then you can only say that you have seen and understood half of Shanghai. Some people often express an exaggerated argument, cursing Shanghai as an uninhabitable demon cave. This is really inevitable, emotional, and overcorrecting. Of course, it is not necessary to say that Shanghai is a paradise on earth, a land of happiness for the rich and poor. It certainly makes people fall, makes people lose their lives, and also provides food for many people's lives: leaving aside good and bad, the merits and demerits are offset. Just take tonight's situation as an example. While I am enjoying the sounds of the cars and the dazzling scenery outside the building in the small building, someone in the neighboring building may be suffering from the noise and lights of this midnight.</p>
<p>Will I really be disturbed by the beauty of this city night and have insomnia? No, that can only be attributed to my habit of disliking beds. If this street building becomes my own, then I can correct it soon. This place can give me a richer and more lively emotion. I envy my friend's happiness, and I also envy the people who have such a street building. I bless Shanghai.</p>

<p>— Qiu Yuan</p>
<p>At this moment, Qiu Hua appeared before him. This appearance was truly unexpected. It had been a year or two since Zhuo Min first met Qiu Hua. At that time, her uncle accompanied her to the office of a publication that Zhen Min was in charge of. Of course, at that time, he only regarded her as a female student. However, in some conversations, he learned that she was capable of not going with the flow and surpassing her peers; among Chinese painters, she admired Ding Jun alone, and Ding Jun was admired by Zhuo Min. This first impression was enough to be deeply engraved. However, Zhen Min always reminded himself that he was already a married man; although there was a deep first impression, it couldn't withstand the passage of time, and in the end, it faded away.</p>
<p>It was in the summer, a year later in the summer, that he met Qiu Hua again on another occasion. Her conversation was more clever, and her actions were more lively and moving. From her bright eyes, one could also see that there was an unspeakable, but actually not unspeakable, charm hidden inside. However, Zhen Min always felt that he was a married man, and any thoughts had to be quickly dispelled. Moreover, although he was not such an outdated person, feudal morality often lingered in his mind. It was after this occasion that he had to give up everything.</p>
<p>It was in early autumn that her uncle came to Shanghai from X place, and there were several other companions. When they arrived in Shanghai, they had to drink. Among them was a single university professor who was already mature in his mid-thirties, but extremely naive at heart, who was extremely enamored of Qiu Hua. Zhuo Min had known this for a long time, and he hoped that they could soon reach paradise. However, this university professor was too naive after all, he didn't know anything. Because of her, he invited many people to eat together one day. Zhuo Min was there, and Qiu Hua was also there. She was more charming, but in the midst of the laughter of the guests, she was always silent. After the meal, they went to her house, at which time her parents had gone to Qingdao to escape the summer heat, leaving her alone. This group went, and also after drinking, they couldn't help but fool around for a while, some singing songs, some laughing inexplicably, while Zhuo Min sat silently and Qiu Hua also sat listlessly. When the guests were tired and couldn't even open their mouths, Qiu Hua took out her Hawaiian ukulele and played the poignant Hawaiian farewell song, the moving Aabe ol! For Zhuo Min, this farewell song especially made him feel a nameless sadness. This melody suddenly made him think of things that happened eight years ago. The scene of crossing the Pacific to the United States eight years ago, when the ship docked in Honolulu, and what he had experienced in the past eight years, came to mind one by one. Time has passed, and old travels are like dreams. What has he gained in the past eight years? The loneliness of sorrow and the desolation of loneliness have increased year by year with the increase of age. Now, when Qiu Hua plays this moving Hawaiian clear string, how can Zhuo Min not feel sad in secret. So he couldn't help but get up, as if he could use the excuse of being drunk, raise his voice, and sing Western songs one by one...and I Know that someday I'll discover the girl of my vagabond dream. He looked at Qiu Hua, looked at her smile filled with affection, and Zhuo Min realized the meaning of "understanding" for the first time.</p>

<p>Opening "Sister-in-law Teasing"</p>
<p>The girl moves into the boudoir. Bowing deeply to the beauty. Sister-in-law, last night my brother returned home. Did you share the pillow together? What happened last night, so much noise? What were you laughing about? Sister-in-law, as the saying goes, a new marriage is not as good as a long separation. Reunion after a long separation is like honey. Why are you so tired today? Why don't you tell me the details? Girl, stop teasing. Don't make a sound. What was the noise last night? It was a cat catching a mouse, a big fight. I wanted to call you. But your brother begged me not to make a sound. I was angry, annoyed, and amused. So there was a雜亂sound in my room. Sister-in-law, I think when my brother is not home. Why is it so quiet and silent? Can he make the mouse make trouble? Isn't it absurd to say that? Sister listen. Calling girl. This matter is not suitable to say the details. If you want to know the details. Wait for your brother to come back and tell you next door. Don't let your brother know. And don't talk about it behind his back. Sister-in-law, tonight my brother is not home. Come, come, let me represent my brother to成双. Sister-in-law retreated in a hurry. That girl is teasing the beauty in every way. How funny is the young woman in the boudoir. Teasing each other is really absurd. Limit my bald pen, hard to describe half a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>The Art Training Seat has specially invited musician Zan from Honolulu to broadcast Qinzhang and Mandolin, accompanied by students from the American Society, this Wednesday (4th) from 5:30 PM to 6:30 PM at the Aviation Radio Station, frequency 1180. The musician is an old Japanese friend of Mr. Shou Zhi and was specially introduced. Listeners please pay attention.</p>
<p>Because of the large number of members, the original site of the Bug Sound Society is no longer sufficient. The new site will be expanded. Ms. Jianying, a female member of the society, has specially made a tall bookshelf to donate to the society's library.</p>
<p>Many male and female actors from the former Shanghai Theater, out of sympathy for the Bug Sound Society's public performance plan, have joined the society one after another. (Above, Fengzi)</p>
<p>Composer Mr. Lu Ji has recently signed an agreement with the Ministry of Communications Radio Station to teach various songs every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 6:30 PM to 7:00 PM. It has now been decided that broadcasting will begin on March 2nd. The first song he will teach is the March of the Volunteers.</p>
<p>The president and vice president of Fei × Society do not understand music theory or　　. (The reporter from Xiaopao Street added to Yinzhang)</p>
<p>Former Feng　(Society　Li Xiao　. That is, Ms. Liying of the current Bug Sound Society.</p>
<p>It is said that Ms. Wang Qi has withdrawn from the Greater Shanghai Singing Society to join the Chunxiao Troupe. Miss Qianying of the Bug Sound Society starred in the society's first public performance of "The Bugle" (Meng Na)</p>

<p>Is a Singer with Both Beauty and Talent</p>
<p>There have been several more famous opera singers from the New York Metropolitan Opera who have dedicated themselves to the silver screen. The more famous ones include Grande Moore, Lawrence Tibbett, Mary Alice, and Negomata Tiema. Now there is another popular singer, Grande Swarthout CGMLCYsSwarthout, who plays the lead role in Paramount's new film "Black-Clothed Heroine" Rose of Rancho (the male lead of the film is John Bowers, which will be released soon at the Cathay Cinema), and her beautiful appearance and slender figure have fascinated many young people. Last year, when the United States elected beauty, she was surprisingly selected as the standard beauty of the United States. It is said that Paramount Company spent a lot of effort to invite her to join the film industry this time, which can't but be said to be a feast for the eyes of movie fans.</p>
<p>Lu Lixia's posthumous work "Two Brothers"</p>
<p>Jin Cheng will release it next time</p>

<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>In the "Crossroads" section of the 28th, there was an article by Mr. Didi titled "Is Mu ×× Declining?" Who is Didi? We don't know. What we do know is that the piece was written on Yaozi's manuscript paper, and on the back, there was also a catalog of "Six Arts."</p>
<p>Also, the manuscript was said to have been forwarded by a certain celebrity.</p>
<p>"Zongying Calendar" says: It is heard that the story of "Wedding Night" is quite similar to the foreign film Paramount's "The Wedding Night."</p>
<p>After the collective resignation of the publicity department staff of Star Motion Picture Company, the staff of various departments have now jointly sent a letter to the company authorities requesting them to retain the resigning staff.</p>
<p>Lianhua Pictorial, Volume 7, Issue 4, contains the words: "Everyone's beloved girls, in addition to Wang Renmei, Li Lili, Chen Yanyan, Li Zhuozhuo, and Mei Lin, there is also Diao Gongbanhua."</p>
<p>(Confucius said: Female stars are great lovers, love is certainly there, but respect is probably "He hasn't even sat on my bed," right?)</p>
<p>"China rarely has good film criticism," that's a fact, but it's even more incomprehensible when film merchants only extract the good words from those not-so-perfect film reviews and use them as "tidal waves of praise." And it is not only incomprehensible, but even astonishing to see a certain promotional publication lamenting "the scarcity of good film criticism" on the front page while extracting "tidal waves of praise" on the back.</p>
<p>(Confucius said: The former is a kind of "ideology," while the latter is absolutely a "business eye." You wouldn't understand these things.)</p>
<h3 id="e201">"National Beauty" to be Released Soon <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>However, the song and dance film "National Beauty" directed by Du Yu has already been completed and will be released soon. The film is divided into ten scenes: Visiting Uncle, Meeting a Woman, Lodging, Selling Candy, Banquet, Emotional Tide, Mistake, Cameo Appearance, Exotic Dance, Resumption of Business. Dan Erchun, who has not appeared on the screen for a long time, plays the role of Fisherman, Bai Hong plays Baozhen, and Bai Yan plays a singer, all of whom are competent. The sets include night markets, lights and shadows, the screen is extremely strange and delightful, and there is also a heavy rain scene, which is extremely grand. The novelty of the filming is unprecedented. Some say that Du Yu is the only smart person in the film industry, and it is expected that there will be a grand scene when it is released.</p>
