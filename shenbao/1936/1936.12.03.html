<h3 id="c48">評修正出版法 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>去年七月間。立法院通過了新出版法。對於出版界的限制。加重了許多。經過全國報界的請願。這個法律。由立法院再度修改。直到十一月二十七日。立法院覆議完畢。卽送國府公佈。修改後的出版法。在一方面。是比去年公佈的要開明一些。在另一方面。政府對於新聞事業。加上了許多新的限制。在言論自由與國家紀律二原則之下。要有一個盡善盡美的法律。是十分困難的。在立法當局鰓此已爲「中正和平。」在言論界或者認爲干涉太大。只有消極的限制。沒有積極的扶掖飯導。則政府欲收齊一輿論促進報業之效。怕是根不容易的。</p>
<p>這五十九條新出版法。所規定的不外兩件事。第一是新聞紙雜誌等出版。要向政府履行登記的手續。第二是出版以後對於有妨黨國利益社會秩序與良善風化者。不許記載。新出版法與去年所公佈的只有幾點不同。在有利於言論界方面的。第一·刋物的主管機關。本爲縣政府或市社會局。新法則以執法之權付於市政府及省政府。縣政府等僅負轉呈及暫時處分之責。省會的報紙。直接歸省政府管理。第二·關於個人家庭陰私。舊法禁止登載。新法把這一點併到良善風俗一項裏面去。處分也輕微些。第三·登記時應塡具的事項。比舊法也减少一些。如編輯及發行計畫。及經費來源。不必報吿。只聲明資本數目及經濟狀况便可。第四·關於更正方法。舊法要報紙登載與原文同樣大小的更正書。新法把「同」字取消了。恢復到現行出版法的相「當」字樣。最後新法規定新聞紙因受行政處分而起訴。官署方面在十天以內對於訴願要加决定。這也是舊案中沒有的。</p>
<p>新法中對於新聞界限制。添了幾項。第一·是對於廣吿的限制。登廣吿的人如果有違反黨國利益社會秩序善良風化的啟事或廣吿。也要受處分。第二·是對於通訊社的限制。凡是通訊社在必要時得由地方主管官署派員檢查其社務及發行狀况。第三·是對於新聞從業員的限制。如果是犯過出版法的或因貪污欺詐行爲而受過刑事處分的。都喪失了發行報紙或編輯報紙的資格。更如刋物出版時。除照現行辦法要送內政部與宣傳部數份外。還要送國立圖書館地方主管官署同立法院圖書館。這都是給出版界的新負擔。新加的限制。在原則上是可以同情的。因爲廣吿的內容。通訊社的內容。都有改進的必要。關於從業員的限制。也有提高新聞記者職業地位的作用。不過有害有益。還要看執法如何。方可判斷。</p>
<p>我們政府接受了報界的請求。把出版法再度修改。對於報界提出的幾點。有相當的容納。這當然是可以同情的。然而我們如果以爲這樣一個很消極的簡單法律。會發揮很大的成效。未免奢望過芸。中國新聞事業方在萌芽時期。遇到的困難是很多的。政府應該抱有扶掖獎勵的態度。解决報業的各種困難。輿論界自然會積極向上。走上軌道的。許多不滿人意的報紙。因爲經濟基礎不穩固。人才缺乏。環境困難。被迫的去登載傷風敗俗的新聞。無益社會的廣吿。目前白紙油墨這樣昂貴。廣吿來源又這樣微薄。可登載的硬性新聞。這樣缺乏。發行又這樣受着限制。民智這樣低微。社會對於新聞記者不重視。政府對於新聞記者無保障。諸如此類。政府都應該設法求其解决。使優良的報紙。有欣欣向榮之可能。但憑官樣的登記與局部的檢查。反使不來登記不受檢查的外國報紙與外國通訊社。橫行中國。出版法的結果。反有背於出版法的本意了。這一點是我們希望政府當局加以注意的。</p>

<h3 id="c99">紗暢銷後存紗吿罄　總計不及一萬包　實爲十年以來未有新紀錄　紗價漲至一二八後新高峰 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>各地紗銷起色後、存紗大减、爲十年來未有之低數、價格漲至二百五十六元新高峰惟棉花因全國未收、印棉價低、造成花賤紗貴之新現象、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>紗銷活動　存紗告罄</p>
<p>自八月以後、現紗銷路、始終良好、繼續不斷向上而久不活動之天津帮亦鉅量買進、上海存紗以致大减、九月底截止、爲三萬四千八百四十包，十月底截止、降至一萬四千二百四十包、其中日廠紗爲一千四百零三包、華廠及英廠紗爲一萬二千八百三十七包、爲近十年來未有之低數、同時華商紗布交易所倉庫存紗、十月底截止、巳减至五千四百八十五包、</p>
<p>紗價已漲　至新高峰</p>
<p>十一月一個月、現紗銷路依然甚好、各紗廠在九十兩個月、已拋出期貨不少、故其可以供給市塲上活動之紗又大减、同時日商紗廠工潮發生、前後計算、大的减少三成生產、其供給市塲、因此更見减少、以造成無紗可購之現象、上星期六、四川銷路大好、以致近數日紗價大漲、十二月份、每包巳漲至二百五十六元新高峰、爲一二八以後所未見、</p>
<p>棉布暢銷　足助紗漲</p>
<p>至於十一月底截止上海之存紗、預計已降至一萬包以內、而華商紗布交易所倉庫存紗、僅剩一千六百零五包、上項紗漲原因、完全由於出產不足應需求、並非投機交易者之操縱、至於以紗爲原料之棉織廠交易、因全國各地農村豐收、人民購買力增强、所以大好、現在已拋買明年之春貨、此足助紗價之漲風、</p>
<p>造成花賤　紗貴新象</p>
<p>棉花過去、並不甚隨紗而漲、近數日則稍漲、實因紗漲太盛、但棉花漲風、仍不及紗、其原因（一）因國內大豐收、估計有一千四百擔之供給、計算必將過剩、（二）因印度棉價低落、日前華棉價格、已與印棉價格相近、如華棉再漲、引起印棉進口、所以一般人對棉價仍看低、此種現象、與紗業實有利、總括言之、仍是過去五六年紗賤而花貴現象之反動云、</p>

<p>頓起疑竇而在此時間之中、李梁志英曾屢决具函、向公司催索賠欵、一面幷在廣州延請徐彰國律師具函、向公司交涉、謂如冉故意延擱、須以法律解决、公司方面、因李之死亡旣不能證明、照章須於七年後再付賠欵、故置之不理、而在暗中繼續調查、直至最近、始得悉李炳昌確尙在人世、以前之死亡消息、實為揑造、藉此</p>
<p>圖騙賠款遂拍電汕頭、着李梁志英到滬面談、李梁志英乃偕其同鄉人張正德（五十六歲）於上月二十六號一同來申、庽於北四川路新亞飯店二〇七號二一五號兩房間、所有一切盤宿費用、概由公司負担、一面由友邦公司派職昌周若甫在暗中偵查若輩之行動、李梁志英與張正德曾於上月二十七·二十八·兩日、至總公司談判兩决、至三十號、友邦公司所派之周若甫、忽見李梁志英赴武昌路</p>
<p>嶺南旅館　十七號房間、　經周查得—七號房間、係由林遠出面、該林某頭戴壓髮帽、狀殊可疑、恐係李炳昌之化身、乃卽報吿總巡捕房、派西探海特馳往嶺南旅館、將林遠逮捕、初尙否認、及將壓髮帽除下、露出頸額疤痕兩個、始證實林遠確為李炳昌之化身、乃又往新亞飯店、將李梁志央·張正德·二人續獲</p>
<p>分別收押</p>
<p>昨晨、解送第一特院刑二庭、捕房律師錢恂九依照刑法三三九條第一三兩項詐欺未遂罪起訴、幷陳述以上情形、謂被吿李炳昌、在捕房內承認因營業失敗、設計詐騙不諱、幷聲明當彼乘海寗輪時、係穿西裝購　等艙位、後改中裝、雜於三等艙上岸云云、經潘振揚推事向三被吿略訊一過、諭令分別押候改期本星期五再訊、</p>

<p>粵人楊文道·葉海生（綽號小廣東）、因日本水兵中山秀雄、於去冬在虹口狄思威路被人槍殺一案、經捕房查係兇手、以預謀殺人等情、向第一特區地方法院提起控訴、初審終結、判决楊葉·均處死刑、但楊·葉·皆不甘服、各由其辯護律師具狀江蘇高等法院第二分院上訴、原定上月十九日開庭審究、届期因楊文道在監息病、轉送醫院治療，不能到案、遂展期至</p>
<p>昨晨九時</p>
<p>由高二分院刑庭長郁華偕周·聶·二推事特開合議庭、飭將楊·葉·兩人提案、並傳集證人研訊、法庭內外、防範甚嚴、檢察官林我朋、亦蒞庭執行職務、上訴人之代理律師張志讓·郭啟明·等、曁捕房律師汝葆彝均出庭、郁庭長向楊·葉·二人訊問年籍後、卽命陳述上訴理由、首據楊文道詳述上訴之理由、及被揚建中誣害經過、略稱、日水兵被害案、我完全不知、旣與日水兵</p>
<p>並無仇恨</p>
<p>何必將此無關係之人打死、憂國心人人皆有、但若打死日兵、亦殊無益、緣有楊桂梅者、會來向我謂、捕房將要拘我、我以從未犯法、不聽其言、楊遂忽忽而去、嗣又有羅文德者來通知、謂楊建中已向捕房報吿、故捕房將要拘、我亦不聽、並於十六號、湖北小同鄕會覔楊建中而遇楊處階、時楊挂梅亦在該會門首、我乃批其頰、責以楊桂梅亦</p>
<p>不應妄言</p>
<p>承認受楊建中之愚、此後卽有人終日隨我、結果被兩便衣日人將我連同陳永生、一併拘入汽車、駛赴捕房、時西探長手執一書、我卽承認該書係我往年藏槍之用、但現在則久不用、倘我與該案有關、伺尙不逃、且將證物留存、翌日解法院提審、我仍承認該書係我藏槍之用、惟見人將槍置於書洞、竟不相符、故我甚異、而從此遂否認該書為我之原書、此書</p>
<p>挖洞之法</p>
<p>本係楊建中所授、本年二月、楊來我家、適我小孩正手持該書戲弄、我則以事上樓、迨我下樓、楊建中巳去、小孩手執之書、亦已不見、由此可見必係楊建中栽贓陷害、總之楊等係一種有計劃之行動、故初審會經張探到案證明、彼在鄭惠民家見有製就手槍形之白紙、並於紙上寫有PB二字、彼等除製造該書外、又偽造一信函、上蓋</p>
<p>同仁協會</p>
<p>及我之私章、我家被抄去各物、均於初審提出、獨不見提出此信、實則此信與書均有關係、應請庭上命令捕房將該信亦提出、以資研究、今我因含不白之寃、故到鈞院上訴、倘該書果係我物、則書上無我之指模、今初審僅憑此一書而判我死刑、我雖不諳法律、諒法律决不如此簡單、初審證人指我在同仁協會與韓人開會拈　等情、但該會之二房東及該會茶房均證明</p>
<p>並無此事</p>
<p>所被涉及者、祇葉海生供我因欲擴充虹口勢力、故將日人打死、假使該日人果係我打死、兇器旣可拋棄、則藏槍之書、何不拋棄、葉又供途中我將槍交彼、則我何不連書一併交給、倘手槍確係我交葉、則試問槍上有無我之手印、此更要求注意者、司法獨立、不能循任何方面之意旨、而將法律破壞、故我</p>
<p>死不足惜</p>
<p>法律為嚴、須求維持、厥後楊建中雖曾自投捕房、並到庭作證、反謂我誣彼、而楊桂梅迄今不見到案、允足見若輩之陰謀云云、而葉海生且泣且訴、謂完全係被屈打成招、是時我猶之係一乳羊、彼等則為一羣猛虎、焉得不屈服、故彼等欲我如何言、我即如何言、而證人曾元·張財源·等所為證言</p>
<p>尤屬虛焦</p>
<p>雖經證人張琛到庭證明鄭惠民等係屬一種有計劃之行動、但我在此環境之下、仍是自承不迭、否則帶回捕房、又將不堪、雖承當時審判長訊我前後供詞矛盾之原因、但我卒不敢直言、倘該日水兵係我打死、何以尙不逃避、而反於决日為母祝壽、張財源與我相識、巳三四年、彼當時供我所穿之衣、尙不符合、鄭惠民因見證據不足、又獻議捕房、謂靑島之舞塲、係楊給資與我開設</p>
<p>赴靑調查</p>
<p>必得詳細證據、捕房聽其言、豈如赴靑調查、結果僅獲得我之西裝一套而已、總之我實寃屈、審判長係屬靑天、儘可向月宮等四舞塲調查、自能明瞭我被誣事實云云、庭上即將藏槍之日用物理學一書訊楊、據供、捕房經我家搜查時、我已被拘至捕房、　故如何抄出、我實不知、而我之書、確於楊建中來訪之日遺失不見、此書之眞假、我殊不能認定、因此書與我書</p>
<p>形式略同</p>
<p>故初决被解至法院、以所立之處距公案較遠、未及詳察、卽承認此書係我者、嗣經細看、始知非我者、庭上又以葉所供涉及楊之部份各點、向揚詰問一過、又訊據葉海生供、據曾元稱、我曾將手槍兩决向其押欵、嗣又將該槍殺死日水兵、是該槍巳三决在我手中、反而槍上毫無遺留我之手模、至於</p>
<p>實地表演</p>
<p>時之動作、亦不過依樣葫蘆、且中西日探長當時均在我左右、故須事事唯命是從云云、而楊文道之律師卽提出楊在獄所作此案始末經過記述一束呈案、以供察核、而張志讓律師則請求再交法醫研究所鑑定該書切痕之久暫、及槍上書上之銹痕、是否一一相符、郁庭長認為母庸再予鑑定、乃諭本案改期至下午二時再審、</p>
<p>下午辯論終結</p>
<p>午後二時，仍由郁庭長開合議庭、繼續提訊、庭上先詢楊上午所請求捕房將偽造爾具名之信件交案、該函與本案有無關係、楊答極有關係、而其律師卽起而陳說該信之關係、謂該信係楊署名致東北義勇軍總監朱姓者、內稱同仁會可組四大隊參加、其用意卽擬證實楊確有擾亂治安之組織、而信係屬偽造者云云、捕房汝律師即稱、該信係於楊被捕後經人附寄至捕房實與</p>
<p>匿名信件</p>
<p>性質相似、由捕房核對筆跡、確非楊所書、亦即置諸不問、今旣提及、且認為與楊文道有利、自當檢案、遂將該信之照片呈庭、經楊閱後、謂確屬此信無誤、而楊之律師郭啟明又請補傳證人李耀到案、因李係當時目覩者之一人、據其供單內謂當時會見葉海生與傑克二人、而無楊文道、且時間亦不符合也、而汝律師即稱、關於李耀、捕房認為</p>
<p>無關重要</p>
<p>故原審並未列為證人、雖將其供單提出、但該供單亦未命李簽字、故實無傳訊之必要云云、經郁庭長裁定對郭律師之聲請、予以駁回、旋又請求庭上將藏槍之書發閱、該書上除下面印有PB兩宇外、其上面是否亦有PB兩字、當蒙發閱之下、上面亦印有此兩字、郁庭長以調查已畢、論令開始辯論、遂由捕房汝律師</p>
<p>先起辯論</p>
<p>略謂、（一）論手槍與子彈、從事實與學理兩方面、均足證明確係兇器、上訴人對於槍彈之懷疑攻擊、胥屬故意無理之吹求、（二）槍上銹紋、與書上銹紋、有四十一點相同、而書係楊家搜得、初楊尙以為槍未查得、故承認係其所有、非屬原書、而謂係楊建中栽害、（三）至葉海生稱其供認係出於刑求、但在最初屢决審理時、從未提及、至將終結時、方稱受刑</p>
<p>殊難採取</p>
<p>（四）上訴人等主張此案係會元·張財源·鄭惠民·等圖得賞金而故意栽陷、但原審之判决、並非採取彼等之供詞、而採取直接之證據、故其主張、毫無理由、（五）至手槍上之無指模一點、實極普通、因該槍上有高低不平之紋條、且因上油之故、實難留指紋、此點巳於原審時、由專家證明、（六）子彈上不留血跡、實因子彈速力及力道極足、且彈屬鋼質、光滑異常、其</p>
<p>不留血痕</p>
<p>殊屬可能等等、當汝律師辯論至此、被告辯護人突星一字條至庭、謂今日有一名洪文蔚者、在庭旁聽、因憤楊文道之被寃、故願到庭作證、並願以生命擔保、應請庭傳訊云云、郁庭長乃宜吿中止辯論、傳洪到庭、卽據洪供稱、粵之中山人、年四十一歲、住東虬江路德康里二十八號、現失業巳年餘、今因到庭旁聽、知楊受寃、故為不平之鳴、自願</p>

<p>後託我去减讓為一千五百元、並無此項欵項、所有李孫氏作證、說有六千元存單交我、並云我脅迫交欽等語、均是虛偽、李孫氏根本沒有此人、王張氏亦未住過我家、官問你現在巳與王漢卿和解了嗎、答、這是報紙謠言、官云、然則不和解、何以王漢卿現在傳不到、並託顧繼榮律師具一撒銷之狀詞、其內容簡直完全自承誣吿、對於他很不利、將來要負刑事責任的、他又豈肯吿你在前、自承誣吿在後、答、他</p>
<p>畏罪逃亡</p>
<p>故而自白、問、民國二十二年、王亦吿過你一次、後來亦是撤銷的、答、這是因息事寗人、故交他五千元、是由顧鼇·查人偉·蔡定·沈增寬·代理王漢卿的、問、據你說公費僅拿四千元、豈肯交還五千元、答、恐纏訟、這是買太平碰到無賴的常事人、實在無法、卽鈞院杜家聲檢察官亦在第一審判罪四年、第二審宣告無罪的、問、你當律師的、還是法律不懂、他敢敲詐你、而你於去年又為何又付他五百元、答、</p>
<p>來信恐嚇</p>
<p>我去我顧　律師、說做做慈善、送他五百元、呌他出一個甘詰、訊至此、辯護律師稱、查王漢鄕提起自訴後、巳經撤回、卽不能再行吿訴、故檢察官之起訴、應請審判長注意、刑訴法二百三十一條規定不受理之判决、檢察官仍可起訴、苟有法律上之見解、仰具狀說明聽候裁定、至此、卽問證人范剛律師稱、王漢卿等盜案、曾由彼與范耆生·黃啟英·等辯護、訂明公費三千元、後由葉茀康來减讓為一千五百元、捕房內實有</p>
<p>存摺一扣</p>
<p>計三千元、是葉茀康代領的、至此、問女律師蔡定供、年二十八歲、常州人、與葉茀康沒有關係、民國二十二年五月、與顧　·查人偉·沈增寬·代理王漢卿自訴葉茀康詐欺一萬八千元、後以五千元和解、至去年五百元、我不知道、至此、顧　律師稱、是二十一年十一月加入律師公會的、關於五千元和解、與蔡定所供略同、惟稱去年王又請朱鴻烈律師寫信葉茀康、當時又由我相勸、當塲由葉交王五百元、朱律師拿四十元、我一錢不要、朱去後、又交王八百元、共一千三百元、總計為六千三百元等語、又傳查人偉律師作證後、又傳顧繼榮律師稱、撤銷狀是伊寫、王漢卿已回去、至此、官諭改期再訊、</p>
<p>挺身作證、官卽命具結後、繼續陳述、謂我旣為洪順會員、亦屬同仁·同義·兩會會員、在十一月五日、我在同義會、未見楊等有拈鬮之事、至十一月九日下午一時、我至同仁會、旋楊亦到會、至夜十一時半、我離去同仁會時、楊尙在會內、在原審我致函審判長、自願作證、但卒禾奉傳喚、如有虛偽陳說、願受極刑云云、郁庭長遂命退去、諭知</p>
<p>繼續辯論、汝律師乃又略加辯論、末後則以本案詳細情形、悉已叙於答辯書內、請就察核、至於今日到庭作證之人、旣屬同仁·同義·兩會會員對其主席犯案、自屬忿忿不平、故其所言、恐凡屬該兩會會員、都欲作如是言之、俱不足信、應謂駁回上訴、維持原判、繼由楊文道之兩辯護律師先後為楊辯白、略謂、當棄海生未由靑島拘解到申時、巳於楊建中·楊桂梅·等向楊文道謂、捕房將欲拘之、楊文道自以</p>
<p>從未犯罪</p>
<p>故付諸一笑、若輩當時之所以放此空氣者、意在將楊文道一嚇而逃、俾彼等可着手報吿捕房、搜索楊家、如厥後將楊拏獲、楊若吾認、則卽以旣未犯案、何故先逃責之、而賞金亦可坐得、初不料楊竟不逃、致若輩勢成騎虎、祗得將錯就錯、一意孤行、楊文道因自以為未嘗犯案、而其家本有一挖洞藏槍之書、是以在捕房及</p>
<p>初次提審時、均承認該書係其所有、迨見取槍置於書洞、格格不入、始覺不宜、因而細察、方知其醫、名同形似、而質則全非者、此際乃否認係其原書、至於葉海生則係從靑島捕解到滬、楊文這巳被拘押之後、始供由楊主謀、而葉每决被解往出事地點表演、允非出於目動、奠不依樣葫蘆、作一幕傀儡戲而巳、以此而被判罪焉能甘服、是以上訴、應請</p>
<p>宣告無罪云云、次由法院為葉海生選任之張志議等律師辯護、謂本案純由鄭惠民·曾元·張財源·等圖得日方及捕房所懸之巨額賞金而起、本案情形如環、連繫而成、一貫之事實、須逐環堅固、始能構成整個之案、倘其中任何一部份之環而被攻破、則此一貫之事實、立卽崩潰、今則就證據方面、如木亭下發見之手槍、已屬不近情理、子彈發見之地點、與死者倒地之所在、子彈上毫無血漬、藏槍書籍子可疑、該書</p>
<p>洞中鐵銹</p>
<p>書洞四週之切痕等等、均足一攻而破、自難據以論罪、况葉之自白、復係出於刑求、每决提審、捕房輙先提一葉之供單、俾一則照單而訊、一卽照單而供、猶唯恐罪名之成立、故自五月六日以後、葉更一一自承、所奇者彼一面承認、一面却哭泣、不特供詞係出於刑求、實地表演、亦非出於葉之自動、表演時、以兩日捕左右挾之而行、辯護律師雖見而不以為然、但因無</p>
<p>抗議機會</p>
<p>殊非不作表示耳、且縱使其自白、並非由於威迫、亦須與事實相符、方能置信、然查葉之自白、與所調查之事實不符者甚多、自不足以採取、然而初審結果、則反是云云、該律師最後更推論中山秀雄之死、因謂就其是日行動而觀、似有殉於桃色氛圍之可能、最後、由林撿察官論吿數語、庭上於辯論終結後、乃諭定期本月九日下午宣判、楊·葉·兩人、由探捕帶回收押、退庭時、已六句餘鐘矣、</p>

<p>本屆西靑籃球、昨晚第一次宣吿客滿蓋為李震中之被邀由京來滬、助辛隊會勦信通海賊隊也、西靑球房上下幾無立錐之地、但比賽結果、辛隊終不能挫滅海賊之鋒芒、而以二十九比四十一、仍讓海賊保持聯賽中之常勝威名、上半時為十五比十、亦為信通領前、另一組麥令甲大勝靑光、比數為六十五比三十</p>
<p>毫無合作</p>
<p>辛隊之敗、一言以蔽之、全隊毫無聯絡藝術也、李震中徐兆熊之參加、使全隊愈不能合作、而李震中為監視長脚蘭茵之投籃、改任守衛、固為良策、但未見顯著之效、而史規亞皮塞爾投籃之準確、卡遜等合作進攻之妙策、終使如一盤散沙之辛隊、不得不敗下陣來、信通聯絡之純熟緊凑、殊非偶然、辛隊以馮念華之表演最佳、李震中獨木不成事、徐兆熊一無可取、</p>
<p>相差七分</p>
<p>上塲時辛隊由馮念華李震中任左右鋒、陳祥龍居中、孫寳慶陸鍾恩任後衛、旋以後方之吃緊、至七比十一時、徐兆熊入塲任李職、調祥龍下塲、分庭抗禮、形勢殊為緊張、但辛隊終無前進希望、分數常差六七分之問、上半時終了為十五比十、</p>
<p>無法挽救</p>
<p>更戰聲起、一度堅持後、因馮念華之兩中、追成十六比十九、頗有欣欣向榮之勢、亦全局分數最接近時、但不久史規亞蘭姆金連獲六分、比數又成十六比二十五、辛隊又吿危急、二十二比二十九後、陳祥龍入塲、又調下徐兆熊、局勢依然不振、而辛隊後防偶一疏忽、皮塞爾蘭茵先後中的、而史規亞於瞬息之間、連得三球、比數一躍而成三十九比二十三、辛隊受此大創、雖經極力掙扎、巳成强弩之末、勝負就此奠定、最後結果為二十九比四十一、信通勝、</p>

<p>— 本報特訊　胡祖蔭調查</p>
<p>十二，醫務設施</p>
<p>工部局各小學學生的醫務是由工部局衛生處所設立的學校醫務處負責進行。學校醫務處成立於二十年十二月，在衛生處處長的指導之下。襄助敎育處各華童小學，處理校中學生的醫務。衛生處聘用具有專門訓練與經騐的西人學校醫務員一人，華人學校醫務員二人及華人學校看護婦五人，專門負責檢查各小學兒童的體格，以及發現，預防並醫治學童一部份的疾病。</p>
<p>根據二十四年度的學校醫務報吿，全年中總共檢查四個小學的學生體格，計有男生一千三百五十一人，女生六百十六人，共計一千九百六十七人。學校醫務員檢查一千九百六十七個學生體格的結果，發現有下列各種缺點：</p>
<p>患服砂者　一，一一三人</p>
<p>患傳染性皮膚病者　四四二人</p>
<p>患心臟缺點者　八六四人</p>
<p>患肺部　點者　三九五人</p>
<p>患扁桃腺缺點者　一，二五二人</p>
<p>患視力缺點者　八九人</p>
<p>患蛔虫病者　一八八人</p>
<p>患其他疾病者　七八人</p>
<p>學校醫務員檢查兒童體格後，分三種辦法處理：（一）兒童身體各方面均屬滿意者，由醫務處通知其家長，該生仍可照常來校上課；（一）兒童身罷方面有些缺點，但不傳染或妨碍其他學生者，由醫務處通知其家長設法醫治，但該生仍可照常來校上課；（三）兒童身體方面患有傳染病足以影響其他兒童健康者，由醫務處通知其家長，速卽為之醫治，同時該生不得到校上課。學校醫務處因經費與設備不足關係，暫且不為兒童醫治普通病症。</p>
<p>平時兒童到校，每晨均由級任敎師檢查一遍。凡患病或有患病嫌疑的兒童，卽由級任敎師送交校長室，轉送學校醫務處醫師檢查。醫務員檢查該生確係患病者，卽將該生送回，請其家長立卽為之醫治。如係患傳染病者，須將該生隔離若干日期後，方可回校上踝；並將校中有關敎室立卽消毒，以免傳染。隔離期間的長短視傳染病的性質而定。患病學生病愈後，須先到學校醫務處檢騐，經醫務員證明病愈，並發給病愈證明書後，方可憑該證明書來校上課。總計二十四年度內，各校患病學生的總人數共有一千零八十四人；其中因病退學者有五百六十二人，病愈仍然返校上課者有五百二十二人。</p>

<h3 id="c178">中華學藝社的責任和前途 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 何炳松</p>
<p>我國事事落後，學術的研究亦然。學術的研究本爲各項事業進步的基礎，所以我們非急起直追不可。但是我們一面要商量舊學使之更加遽密，一面要涵養新知使之格外深沉，工作旣繁，責任亦重。我們要謀中國學術的獨立，要謀人類文明進步的貢獻，勢非聯合全國同志共同努力不爲功。我們假使以這種意義來估量我們的中華學藝社，那我們就不能不佩服二十年前後起組織本社的那一班人眼光的正確和遠大。到如今，本社光榮的存在已達二十年了，在這二十年中本社合全體社友之力，出版了百期以上的專著和一百五十期以上的雜誌，此種成績，雖不算怎樣驚人，但確已值得我們的紀念，二十年來主持社務者，維護本社者，以及全體九百餘社友，不知化了多少的精力和心血，才能把本社造成現在這種學術上重要的地位。我們飲水思源對他們應該致敬。</p>
<p>近年以來，本社好像有一部社友感覺到本社的事業衹限於研究和出版，範圍未免太狹，很想努力從事於實際事業的貢獻，表示本社對於國家和社會服務的熱忱。這種服務精神當然是很可欽佩的。尤其當此國步艱難之會，凡我社友都應當念起直追，各盡所能來促進復興民族的運動。</p>
<p>不過愚見以爲凡是學術團體似乎不宜急求近功，似乎仍應以學術的研究爲他最主要的任務。我們有餘力時固不妨附帶辦理若干直接有利社會的事業，但决不可因此而輕視了或甚至犧牲了我們主要的任務。</p>
<p>事實上，現代文明國家的一切建設事業，可脫沒有一個不以學術研究爲其前提和根據。例如蘇聯的五年計計劃，美國的新措施都是各該國各科專家研究心得的結晶由政府加以實現。近來日本軍部改革行政機構運動中所最着重的的一點，亦就是中央研究機關的强化和擴大。這都足以證明學術研究在現代國家和社會建設上所佔地位的重要。</p>
<p>我們的中華學藝社旣有二十年的光榮歷史，又有九百人以上的各科專家做我們的社員，而且已曾陸續出版百種以上的專著和一百五十期以上的雜誌，基礎已極鞏固。我們正宜秉承創辦人的初衷，和維護本社者的本意，繼續負起學術團體應負的責任，共同向學術研究方面盡其最大的努力。</p>
<p>倘使我們原有的叢書能够繼續不斷的出版，其內容能够精益求精；我們原有的學藝雜誌，能够在量上增加期數和篇幅在質上充實門類和內容，那我們就不特可告無罪於創辦人的初衷和維護人的熱望，就是對於全體社友和國人亦可人交代得過去了。總之，愚見以爲我們要發揚光大我們的中華學藝社，我們應該繼續我們各人努力研究的精神，並繼續以研究所得貢獻本社，作爲本社獻給我們國家和民族的的禮物們根據已往全體社友對於愛護本社的熱忱　來，我們中華學藝社的前途無量，那是可以預卜的了。讓我們大家高呼三聲中華學藝社萬歲！</p>

<h3 id="c180">中華學藝社二十週年感言 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 王兆榮</p>
<p>中華學藝社成立以還，迄今已二十週年。其間人事滄桑，變幻靡定，而國難之嚴事有加，更非立社時所能想像及之者。書生報國，效果渺微，回顧前塵，慚悚無地矣。</p>
<p>在此二十年中，本社所持與世人相見者；雜誌也，彙刊也，論文集也，各補叢書也，影印古籍也，刊行之數，固不在少。但對於其他有關科學藝術之事業，或因故未能進行，或進行而猶未故未能進行，或進行而猶未顯著其成效，是則吾人深引爲憾者也。惟學術團體之締造，視之一人之成長，則大有差，而其壽命固當以百年千年計之，决非如常人之有「人壽幾何」之感也。故行年二十之本社，毋寗謂之尚有稚氣，猶待扶持，較爲適宜。然而本社創設之初，卽標其義曰：研究眞理，昌明學藝，交換智識，促進文化。吾人固秉此初志，終始勿渝，以期由文化學術而有所貢獻於國家社會也。</p>
<p>夫此種文化事業，固不可以旦暮計功，然銖積寸累，亦不可一日或輟也。吾人念締造之不易，感職責之匪輕，自應時自警惕，回省過去，茍有進也，則將更謀所以繼長增高，倘無成也，尤須競競業業以求所以赴之。譬如商賈，逐日記帳，月有月結，年有年結，以省其虧盈焉。惟不自懈忽，斯可期其邁進耳。過去二十年間，雖緣種種事變，使本社社務瀕於停頓者再三，卒以社友之辛勤，社會各方之援助，本社本至矢折。今後勇猛圖之，預料十年二十年後，本社之施設，或可有異於今日。要在吾人之毋怠母矜，持之以恒而已。（中略）</p>
<p>復次，本社二十週年之際，適值緩事緊張之時。屏藩受脅，國步多艱，彼執戈衛國者，正　戰於冰天雪地之中。吾人遠處後方，軌轍雖異，心理則同，如何始有補於國事，固懸爲標的而念茲在茲也。殊途同歸，願與國人共勉焉。</p>

<h3 id="c181">羅馬的救國英雄 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 李素</p>
<p>三個勇敢的戰士·救了快要滅亡的羅馬</p>
<p>（一）羅馬城上</p>
<p>（元老院的議官們站在城牆上望着河的對岸，瞧見敵軍在拉斯波仙拿的領導之下，向着羅馬前進。那些進攻的隊伍只有一條路可以準羅馬城，那就是一道權跨河面的狹窄）</p>
<p>羅馬人甲：我們得馬上决定策略以保羅馬的安全。</p>
<p>乙：我們的士兵又敗退了。我們主這小小軍隊，以寡敵眾，能僥倖麼？</p>
<p>丙：只要他們在敵軍到達以前，安穩地退過橋這邊來，他們就能有一個極好的機會了。</p>
<p>乙：最要緊是馬上得有所動作，不然，我們就要完啦。</p>
<p>丙：我提議我們的兵士一到就立刻過橋。等他們都過完了，就可以以把橋拆斷，使敵人不能追上來。</p>
<p>甲：這似乎容易，可是誰有那麼勇敢守在河邊抵禦敵人，一直等到橋拆斷呢？</p>
<p>乙：羅馬同胞，看看河那邊吧！敵人又把我們的軍隊戰退了。我們無論幹什麼，都得馬上就幹才行。</p>
<p>丙：荷咧等斯來了，也許他能給我們想辦法。</p>
<p>乙：荷咧雪斯，今天眞是羅馬的一個存亡關頭的日子。天沒有晚以前敵軍就可以攻進城來了，除非我們馬上使用强有力的手段。</p>
<p>荷：我已經同我的兵士討論過，我們都認爲只有一個方法可以挽救羅馬。那道橋非拆掉不可。</p>
<p>乙：這正是我們所想到的。可是這怎麼辦得到？除非我們留下一部分人在橋的那端去擋住敵人的前進。</p>
<p>荷：那道狹窄的橋，有三個人就足以抵禦一百個敵軍了。</p>
<p>甲：這倒是眞的，但是那三個人是準死的了。我們上那兒去找這麼勇敢的三個人去與敵方全軍對抗呢？</p>
<p>荷：「死」對於這世上的每一個人，或早或晚總得臨到的，而且一個人的死還有比爲羅馬而死更光榮的嗎？我願意充當三人中的一個。我相信我還能找到兩個同志的。</p>
<p>丙：說得好，荷咧雪斯！</p>
<p>荷：（對他的兵士）。我要兩個人，當這邊拆橋的時候同我去擋住敵人。那是一種苦鬥，還許是長久的。我們也許不能生還。誰願意路　？</p>
<p>（兩個軍人走上前）。</p>
<p>士：我，士標理阿斯，决意跟你。</p>
<p>荷：謝謝，士標理阿斯。你是一個英勇的人，而且是一個堅强的戰士。我確知道你能以一當千。</p>
<p>太：還有我，太杳斯，决意跟你。</p>
<p>荷：好！有兩個這樣的軍人，一個在我左邊，一個在我右邊，不經過長時間戰鬥，敵人是不能進犯到橋邊的。</p>
<p>乙：勇士們，我們在後方的人眞沒有法子表示我們的感謝。你們是犧牲性命來救羅馬的英雄。</p>
<p>荷：我們犧牲是爲了愛國和使我們的子孫得到自由。我們不是要人感謝。來吧，士標理阿斯和太杳斯。我們曾經多次在一塊同敵人苦鬥過，運最後一次還能和你倆一起，眞是太幸了。在敵軍沒有到以前，我們須先去守住自己的位置。</p>
<p>（二）橋</p>
<p>（羅馬軍隊已過橋進了城門，只有那些在拆橋的沒有進去，拆橋的工作快完成了。荷咧雪斯和他兩個卒伍勇敢地在抗戰，使敵軍不能踏上橋頭一步。）</p>
<p>荷：敵人已經退後去計劃新的進攻策略了，術杳斯。我們須得趁這機會休息休息。</p>
<p>太：荷咧雪斯，剛才他們一瞧見我們的時候，你見他們笑沒有？他們現在可不在笑了！</p>
<p>士：小心，他們又來了！</p>
<p>太：那麼，來吧！讓我們湊近你們。他們不敢前來攖我們的劍鋒。</p>
<p>士：不敢，他們當然不敢。你瞧瞧我們面前的那些死屍。我眞累得厲害。若是他們再以大隊進攻，我不敢保我還能支持下去。你受傷了嗎，太杳斯？爲什麼你使左手拿劍？</p>
<p>太：我的右手傷了，但是不要緊。別作聲，士標理阿斯！你能聽見他們遠在橋那端呌喚我們嗎？他們說什麼？</p>
<p>荷：回去，太沓斯！回去，土標理阿斯，趁着橋還沒有倒下去！現在就走，朋友們，趁敵人還沒有回過來進攻。我會跟上你們的。</p>
<p>太：來呀，士標理阿斯，理在是時候了！</p>
<p>（他們倆剛在橋倒下去以前跑過去了。荷咧雪斯因爲留在後邊所以能把敵人擋住，當他的朋友退走的時候。他一步一步退到那已經倒在河中的橋邊。）</p>
<p>（三）羅馬城邊的河岸上</p>
<p>太：站住，士標理阿斯——我們扔下了荷咧雪斯一個人。唉，他幹嗎不馬上跟着我們？</p>
<p>士：我們現在對他是無能爲力了。他是需要我們幫忙的，太沓斯；你瞧敵人已把他迫回來了！</p>
<p>太：士標理阿斯，那最後一劍把他的臉刺傷得很厲害。我怕他已經瞎掉一隻眼睛了。</p>
<p>士：眞是一名多麼出色的戰士！他的劍斷了，但是他還繼續戰鬥。</p>
<p>太：我明白他在幹什麼了。他是一直抵抗等到有機會跳進河裏去。</p>
<p>士：他跳進河裏去了！幹得好，荷咧雪斯，與其落在敵人手中，他寗可自殺了。太沓斯，他受傷太重，到不了我們這邊河岸上來了。</p>
<p>太：你錯了，士標理阿斯，你錯了！他還在戰鬥呢，爲他自己的生命對水抗戰！</p>
<p>士：他快到河岸了！努力，荷咧雪斯，到這邊來！水順勢把他衝向我們這邊的河岸來了。</p>
<p>太：你來，士標理阿士，讓我們幫幫他。他一定差不多要死啦。</p>
<p>（他們出去到了水裏，幫助荷　咧雪斯到河岸上。）</p>
<p>士：嗨，勇敢的荷咧雪斯，若是我們不以爲你緊跟在我們後邊，我們是怎麼也不會離開你的。</p>
<p>荷：朋友們，請幫幫你忙。我看不大淸楚了。我們今天是救了羅馬，而且還活着可以再爲它爭戰</p>
<p>太：請進城來，荷咧雪斯。民眾在呌喚你了。元老院的　官們在城牆上已看見了一切的經過。他們一定希望向你致謝的，因爲你已經完成了他們所認爲不可能的事，而且救了羅馬。</p>
<p>荷：我並不是一個演說家啊，太沓斯，我只是一個軍人。帶我到一個地方讓我可以休息吧。我非常累了。太沓斯和士標理阿斯，你們今天在我身邊是多麼勇敢地在爭戰啊，這使我永遠也忘不了。</p>
<h3 id="c182">史可法 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 周源</p>
<p>不能以勝敗論英雄，守土的將士，能與城同盡的，便是好漢</p>
<p>明思宗自纔的消息傳到南京，南京的大臣們都驚慌得說不出話來；一邊穿起白衣替思宗帶孝，一邊設法出兵報仇雪恨。他們以爲國不可一日無君，必須要先立個皇帝，然後再誓師北伐，方纔能够名正言順；於是緊跟着討論到「人選的問題」。</p>
<p>當時北京的親王逃難到南方的很多，居住淮安的潞王常淓和福王由崧最惹人注意，大臣張愼言姜曰廣們等說：「福王是思宗的堂兄，按理應當立他。可是他有貪財，好色，不孝，不肯讀書，苛待下人，喜歡管閒事種種短處。潞王雖然是思宗的堂叔，人倒很精明强幹，可以立他。」當時大家都無異議，怎奈擁有重兵的鳳陽總督馬士英想利用福王的短處，好在朝裏獨自專權，便派兵把福王送到儀眞，南京的大臣們也只好去迎接！</p>
<p>這許多大臣裏面，有個河南人呌做史可法。他生得矮矮的身材，黑黑的面孔，兩眼亮光閃閃，很有神氣。當羣臣們朝見福王時，福王的臉色紅得火熱，直想走開。史可法攔阻道：「不能走。應該端端正正坐着受朝拜。」隨後討論到出兵的問題，史可法說道：「王應當穿着素衣，親身到郊外點兵拔將，整軍北伐，把報　雪恥的意思。告訴天下人。」福王點點頭說：「好吧，就這般做好了！」第二天，羣臣就立福王做了皇帝。可法　任爲禮部尚書，不久改任兵部尚書，後來又作揚州督師出鎭揚州，抵禦淸兵南侵。</p>
<p>可法雖做了督師，但他在軍中，日夜與兵士共同甘苦，絕不使自己多有一點受用，兵士們沒有吃飽，自己不先喫飯，兵士衣服沒有穿暖，自己也决不會加一件衣裳的。他晚上批閱公文到夜深還不去睡覺；就是睡覺的時候，也只是和衣躺下，略微打個盹兒就完了。有一次除夕的晚上，他批閱公文，直到半夜還沒有完，已經有些疲倦了，想喝點酒，提提精神。廚子來說：「好菜全分散給兵士了，沒有東西可以下酒的。我再給你做幾樣下酒的。我再給你做幾樣下酒的菜吧？」可法說「用不着那麼麻煩，拿點鹽豆鼓來就行了。」可法平常很會喝酒，有時連飲幾斗都不醉；自從到軍營裏來以後，連酒氣也不曾聞過。可是這回，他却一連又喝了十來碗，喝呀喝的，忽然想起思宗來，不覺淚河開了閘，大哭起來。半響，倦了，就伏在案上，昏沈沈地睡去。</p>
<p>天明了，將士們都聚集在轅們外，門却閉得緊緊的。他們只得靜靜地守候，心裏却在胡亂的猜疑着。後來可法身邊的僕從將緣故說了出來；知府任民育說：「他這樣的好睡，眞是不易多得的。人們別驚醒他，趕快去告訴更夫，呌他仍舊打四更。你們也都小心點，不要弄出聲音來。」一會兒，史可法醒了，日光已經照耀得滿窗通紅，外面還在打四更，不由得可法怒氣大作，喝道：「誰敢亂我法令？快把那更夫捉去殺了！」任民育連忙過來賠罪，把主使的意思說淸楚了，他纔沒有殺掉那個更夫。他的軍令雖然這般森嚴，可是他也常常到軍營裏去，和兵士們談話，親自教給他們打仗時攻守的方法。如果兵士中有患病的，他撫摸着病人的傷處詳細詢問疾病的狀况。有時看見重病將死的人，兩眼貯滿眼淚哽咽着說不出話來。所以兵士們常說「史大人時時刻刻都惦記着我們，愛惜我們，我們怎能不出力打仗呢！」</p>
<p>順治二年（公元一六四五年）淸政府的軍隊，由豫王多鐸率領。自陝西往東走，直回河南歸德來，沿途經過的三十多縣，都望風投降了。歸德旣失，他們又侵擾安徽的泗州。史可法正打算出兵協助泗州抗敵，不料遇着明寗南侯左良玉，以殺除權奸馬士英阮大鋮等爲名，進攻南京。明政府惶恐已極，便命史可法趕救南京，他只好改向南京去。剛渡江到燕子磯，左良玉軍已失敗了。明政府要他守住泗陽，他便匆匆跑回天長，命諸將去救肝胎。正忙亂間，有探卒來報：「盱胎已經降了淸兵，泗州援將侯方嚴全軍覆沒了。」他聽見這報告，楞住了半天，馬上用一天一夜的功夫趕回揚州。他眼眶裏滿含着淚水，勸將士們要盡力爲國保守疆土，同時發宣言向各鎭　兵援救。</p>
<p>誰知各鎭全不理睬，只有總兵劉綮基帶領四千兵來，氣吁吁地從泗陽西邊的白洋河趕來。他請史可法乘淸兵沒有到齊，趕緊背城一戰，挫一挫敵勢。史可法不贊同他的意見，說道：「與其野戰，不如留點兵力保守城池，等候各地的救援。」他一面派兵守城，一面上公文給政府請救趕快調兵來救。</p>
<p>四月二十日，淸兵已經全部到了揚州城下，駐紥在斑竹園，降將李遇春帶了豫王的招書，到城下來招降。史可法聽說李遇春來了，很生氣，走到城上，對着李遇春駡道：「明政府並沒有薄待了你，你却背恩忘義，投降了滿淸；還有何面目到這兒見我？」遇春聽了，厚着臉皮勸他道：「你的赤膽忠心，中外人士沒有一個不知道的，難道你的朋友倒反不信任你！不過如今旣是奸佞當權，你幫他出力又有什麼用處，我想你不如歸順大淸。不然，縱使你犧牲了性命，明政府也不會給你一些好處！所以我勸你還是做個和事老兒，使得兩家停戰息兵，而你也可以高位厚祿，封妻蔭子，這樣豈不是名利雙收嗎？」可法聽了大怒道：「呸！你胡說些什麼　！士卒們，趕快放箭射死這個賣國求榮的東西。」城上的箭都離開了弦向李遇春飛去。李遇春看見不好，拍馬而去，因他跑得快竟讓他逃掉了。</p>
<p>過了一會，多鐸又呌一個鄉下人，拿了封信到城濠裏，去喊守濠人，說明要面見史督師。守濠人報告史可法，可法就從城上縋下一個壯卒，把那鄉下人和信，一股腦兒扔到水裏去了。</p>
<p>多鐸知道史可法愛國心誠，非常敬重他；越敬重他，也越發想他投降。便下令將士暫且不要攻城，又寫了一封婉轉的信差人送給可法。勸他投降，可法見了，也毅然的拒絕以了他。順手把那信也投在火裏化了。豫王知道可法的心，不是能用口舌所能打動的，便又下了攻城的命令。</p>
<p>第二天，監軍副使高岐鳳等出城降了滿淸，城裏兵力更見微弱。人心惶惶，朝裏文武各官也都親自上城把守。這時史可法寫了封信給他的母親和妻室，向他們告別。又從容吩咐部將史德威道：「我若是死了，請你把我的屍首葬在高皇帝陵傍，這一步，萬一做不到，那就埋葬在梅花嶺下也好！」說完，穿起盔甲，趕到舊城最險要的西門去防守。</p>
<p>城守得越堅固，攻城也更兇猛。淸兵直把揚州圍得水洩不通，不分畫夜的攻打。史可法着急了。用砲攻敵，打死了好幾千人。淸兵主帥見此情形，親自率領敢死隊來攻城。忽然城西北角炸雷般一聲巨響，倒塌下來了。淸兵趁着缺口，往裏衝去。守城的明兵也不示弱，直立不跑，拼命向上城的人發箭。城下的屍體，如山高積；敵軍踏着這一個一個的屍體升上城來。於是城上就換了滿淸的旗幟。</p>
<p>當城被圍得緊急時，史可法向莊子固道：「萬一城破了，就請你先用刀把我殺死。」莊子固也答應了。到這時候，史可法伸出　頸來，呌子固段他。子固怎能忍心下手？可法見他不肯，立時拔出刀來朝自己　頸抹去。子固　瑾忙趕將來，將他抱住，奪去了他手裏的刀。雖然沒有死，已經是紅血染衣了。</p>
<p>當時子固等數十人，連拖帶抱的把可他扶出城。剛走到小東門，淸兵瞧見許多明兵往城外走，一齊發箭；子固與許瑾等人都被射死。可法掙扎着傷，提高喉嚨喊道：「我是這城的史督帥，你們只管帶我去見你們的主帥吧！」這些淸兵聽說是史督帥有些不信，但又不敢小覷了他；就連拉帶扯的把他送到新城南門樓上去見多鐸</p>
<p>多鐸正在忙亂的時候，看見兵士們領進來一個血汚的明人，心裏十分詫異，問道：「你是誰？」史可法很安寗的答道：「我就是史可法。」多鐸　說是史可法，驚訝得好久不能做　，目不轉睛的望着他。歇了會纔說：「先生獨守孤城，非常佩服，現在城已破了，先生愛國的心力也算盡了。可以答允我的要求；替我們淸政府統一江南嗎？」可法聽說要他投降，不由得髮上指，大聲說道：「我是明朝的大臣，朝廷給我揚州，我不能代他保守；還有什麼面目偷生，如今我到這兒來，只想借你的刀子，取下我的頭來。並沒有別的意思，你不要誤會了我。」多鐸雖見他說得斬釘截鐵，仍不死心，又說道：「先生沒有看見我們的大帥洪承疇嗎？你如果肯給我們出力，也能和他一樣的受用。」史可法輕蔑的一笑道：「哼，哼，洪承疇？你們對待洪承疇，還能比得上崇禎皇帝待他嗎？他受了朝廷多大的恩惠，還把朝廷賣了；難道眞能忠心對你們嗎？我無時不在恥笑他的賣國求榮，痛恨他的沒良心；我反倒要去學他？」說得豫王沒有話可說，但還心僂他正在盛怒之下，勸他投降，自然不會成功的。於是又命部下一個最會說話的將官，名呌宜爾頓的去倍伴他，呌他慢慢的勸他投降，希望說動他的心。</p>
<p>宜爾頓伴了可法三天，也整整勸了三天，史可法仍舊是不肯投降，多鐸才知道可法愛國的忠心，堅如鐵石，是無法搖動的，又怕留着不利他的國家。於是，可法就在他們手下殉國了。</p>

<p>— 彬</p>
<p>——商務出版——</p>
<p>近幾年來，我國的出版界對讀書運動的提倡頗爲熱心，讀書雜誌，讀書指導，升學指導，以及各科指導和研究方法等書籍亦顧之風起雲湧；這當然是很好的現象。但是，如果我們把這一類書籍嚴格的考察起來，便會覺得不滿；不是編著者草率從事，便是內容的重復和不發。所以，把這一類組製濫造的書籍供給學生，讀者，和研究者去讀，其結果恐怕與出版者的原意適得其反，而且對他們有莫大的害處的隨之對讀書運動的進展，發生了極大的妨害；對於這事，出版者和編著者是不能不負責任的。我們在感到失望之餘，却仍然熟望着;出版界能出版幾本良好的，讀書指導一類的書籍，以供給讀者去閱讀。</p>
<p>在大多數讀者約期待中，商務印書館的讀書指導便一輯二輯先後出版了；這當然是很可喜的事情。該書第一輯已經出版一年，據說頗受讀者的歡迎和好評。第二輯在最近纔出版之所以，我們對於他認爲有介紹和評論之必要。讀書指導第二輯所包括的文章，共分各十五類，總計三十一篇；其中有些是爲第一輯所沒有的，可說是盡了補充的任務。</p>
<p>蔡元培先生曾在該書的序文裏，舉出了讀書指導一類書籍應有的優點，卽：「便於自修」，「便於參考」，與「便於增加常識」三點。讀書指導第二輯便包含着三種優點。其中所輯的三十一篇文章，或者含有上述的優點之一，或者兼有兩種甚至於全部。現在，讓我們舉出這篇文章，加以槪略的評論；由此可以想見全輯文章的內容，是怎樣適合讀者的需要。</p>
<p>第一，爲馬宗榮的怎樣研究圖書舘學？他在這篇短短的文章裏，發表他那注重圖書舘學的研究和經騐的意見，並且爲初學者介紹了許多良好的圖書舘學一類的書籍。這對於他們，可說是一條適宜的路徑。</p>
<p>第二，爲周予同的怎樣研究經學？他主張：研究者先應懂得經學，然後纔談得上研究；並且須有文字學的基礎，研究起來纔不發生困難。他對於經學的解釋和分類，具有特殊的見地。至於經學的讀法，他主張：先讀淺近的經學書籍，後讀成問題的，重要的。最後的結論是這；「以『史』的觀點為來治『經』，以社會科學的見地，發掘經典裏的沈埋的材料。」這比較那一些頑固的，經學者的意見，當然要新穎，適用得多了。</p>

<p>以便在龐雜的哲學內包中理出一些頭緒，條理和界限來，使在研究時有一定的理論綫索可循。這樣才能理解其理論與觀點。這種分析工作，可以說是研究哲學時所必須的一種瀝淸手續，所以說這種分析的工作，在哲學研究中是必要的。</p>
<p>五·哲學的綜合研究：</p>
<p>哲學中的諸問題，根本上就是有關聯性和統一性的，哲學的全形就是一個整個的宇宙觀和人生觀，是一個完整的精神體系，而不是片段的不相互關聯的理論和思想。因爲哲學中的各種問題都是有機的相互關聯的，所以在分析的研究之中，也要同時進行綜合的研究，理解部分與個別的問題，和理解全體與一般的問題是同樣重要的。倘若要建立一個整個的宇宙觀和人生觀，和要了解哲學的全形，哲學的綜合研究就有其必要了。至於如何進行綜合研究的問題，我們一方面要在哲學的對象之部分間入手綜合，由此進到世界之全部眞象的認識，那麼這一綜合的形式和內容，將是包括自然哲學，社會哲學，乃至思維科學之各部分與全體的關聯和總和的研究的；　方面應將哲學自身的諸問題加以綜合，才能認識哲學的全部，才能有一個完全的哲學思想體系。總之，如果不加以分析研究，而囫圇吞棗地去研究哲學，是不能理解哲學的具體內容，因而不易獲得正確的精密的宇宙觀的；但如果只作片段的研究，只注目於具體的個別的問題而忽略了哲學的全豹，一樣不能理解全部哲學體系，獲得整個的宇宙觀的。具體的詳細的研究，和體系的綜合的研究，在哲學研究中，乃是隨時必須並用的研究方法。</p>

<p>夫婦智識</p>
<p>— 德國醫學博士張君實</p>
<h3 id="c187">夫婦生活的指南針 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>……性生活爲溝通夫婦感情之橋樑使其和好無閒　……少年摧殘過甚生殖腺衰頹萎弱愛情常致破產</p>
<p>人心不同，各如其面，這句話道盡了全世界的一切人。學識，經歷，志願，癖嗜，性情，各個人間多少有點不同。結婚便把兩個男女拉在一起，過一種共同的調和的生活，其中自然不免要把差異得太厲害的地方矮正一點。在夫婦生活中，這點犧牲是必要的，可是必需有了極濃厚的愛情，方能心甘情願地去遷就對方。這種和好無間的愛情，必須有美滿的性生活方能發生。</p>
<p>原來這性生活打破了一切的隔膜，使夫婦倆各自沈醉在對方的懷抱裏，享受着至高無上的愉快。兩個人的身和心，彷彿化而爲一，各自感覺到自己不過爲對方的一體。於是不知不覺地將不同的習慣，性情，癖嗜，趣味，調和起來，使共同生活得以和諧地進行。</p>
<p>可是很不幸地，許多的男和女，他們的性機能是殘缺不全的，性生活的愉快和幸福，他們都無緣領略。共同生活失却了天然的橋樑，隔膜無從打開，一切的調和工作無法進行，兩個不同的個性，在長時期的密切接觸中，當然極易發生衝突。</p>
<p>再說，性是人類天然的大慾，如果不能滿足地享受，對於對方的萎弱，必致引起憎恨之心，夫婦乃化爲仇讎。</p>
<p>這種人間世的慘劇，多半是當事者本身的過失。性機能的成熟，在每個人的身中，本來都循着常軌進行。許多不幸的少年男女，偏在發育進行之時，犯了手淫，縱慾等惡習，於是生殖腺受摧殘而萎弱，男子遂有遺精早洩，陽萎和性器短小等症；女子則性感薄弱，月經不調。</p>
<p>發覺自己有了這種病，千萬不要急於結婚；婚後發覺的也得少安無躁，不必絕望；男子從速服「希米脫氏固精片」，以止遺精而固精關。同時再服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」早洩陽萎立愈，而且能使太短小的性器，發育長大。女子宜速服女性生殖腺素製劑「女用生殖素」，能調整月經，恢復性感。這樣一來，所有的缺憾全都可以補救了。夫婦生活的美滿快樂，自爲意料中事。</p>
<p>這種生殖腺素製劑，以其能使精力倍增，體態正　常的夫婦亦可取為冬令補品，閨房之中，定能增加許　多樂趣。</p>

<h3 id="c188">談談淋病的特效藥 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>治療淋病是種非常吃緊的工作，半步不能放鬆。如果略略含糊了點，殺菌除毒未盡，急性淋病會變爲纏綿難治的；慢性淋病，單純的淋病會引起各種危險的並發症。因此治療之時，必須一步不鬆地緊逼過去，使淋菌沒有喘息的餘地，在最短期間殺完。</p>
<p>要實現這種治療法，必須愼於擇藥。首先，我認爲內服藥的使用，較勝於注射藥。因注射必由醫師行之，病家易於間斷，便不能達到根治之目的。內服藥可自行服食，不致間斷停頓。</p>
<p>可是舊有的內服藥，配製不精，或則僅能利尿鎭痛，無殺菌之力；或則藥性雖猛，只能獲一時之安，不能根治；或則有傷腸胃，反生他患。因此種種缺點，內服藥在以前的淋病療法中，竟毫無地位。然而若卽謂內服藥卽無成爲特效藥之可能，不免太武斷了。</p>
<p>事實上證明，近來德國傑特生博士已發明一種淋病內服特效藥，定名爲『安敵淋』。具有偉大的殺菌能力，並能使體內產生抗毒素，淋菌决沒有深入體內以潛伏的機會，只能候在那兒俯首待縛。像如此以殺菌抗毒，雙方並進的特效藥，在注射劑中也沒有可以與之比擬的。並且配製精純，藥力强大而和平，有循序而進，迅速治愈之功；絕無任何副作用發生，確係治淋之聖藥。</p>

<h3 id="c189">手淫對於性神經衰弱的關係 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>……早洩陰萎性器發育受阻均爲手淫過度後所誘起的症候　……幼少時的手淫每能連帶制止了睪丸攝護腺的發達生機</p>
<p>手淫是對於靑年有百害而無一利的，想必略爲懂點醫學常識的人所盡知的事實。然則這樣的行爲，在如何的時候，始起最有害的作用呢？則從體質方面看來，道先是在神經系的人，其弊害表現出來的最爲顯著。此外，在腺病體質的人，是受相當較大的影響。這是因爲神經系統過敏與其抵抗力之過甚微弱的緣故。</p>
<p>至於，因此種惡癖所招來的重大疾病，究竟有幾種呢？，今姑就通常最易遭　到的二三症狀，記出以觀，則略如以下所述。</p>
<p>性神經衰弱症，這在很多的例證上，都幾乎是必發的症狀。例如遺精，因此而誘起了早洩，其高度者，甚或終身陷於勃起力薄弱狀態，完全將性能喪失殆盡！</p>
<p>此外，因手淫的過度，而惹起生殖器的發育不良者，愈在早年實行手淫的人，其影響也就愈大。這就是說，在尚幼小的時代而卽對彼未發達的生殖器給與以過烈的戟刺時，便惹起了發育神經系統的障碍；而因爲這個緣故，遂行中止了生殖器底發育，同時，附屬器卽睪丸攝護腺等，也有很多的連帶被制止了其發育的趨勢。</p>
<p>復次，頭腦感覺脹痛，記憶力不良，以至稍覺操勞，就容易感覺疲勞，倦怠，精神恍惚，失眠，盜汗及心悸亢進等等，此爲手淫過度後最易顯出的疾病，誠妨碍靑年健康的重大問題也。</p>
<p>爲治療本症起見，不得不首先禁止其手淫行爲，而且要决心去經營那合乎高尚規則的生活，同時必服以『希米脫氏固精片』以治遺精，因本劑功能鞏固精關，澄淸意志，實爲尅制遺精的對症良藥，至多經過三星期遺精卽止，其他對於早洩，陰萎，發育不全及種種的神經衰弱症者，要用那振作生殖腺及增加內分泌的生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』以治之。確具驚人的效騐，保證短期治愈，原因由於『生殖素』能誘使陰部神經叢的機能亢進，鼓興發育神經。</p>
<p>戒煙常識</p>
<h3 id="c190">戒煙方法的新貢獻 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 俞伯符醫師</p>
<p>我縣壺行醫之初，逢到來戒煙的病人，最感棘手。在戒除期中，常有許多病人來說：「我昨天痛苦得受不住了，只得又吃了口煙，有什麼方法免除這種痛苦呢？」對於這種情形，除了勸他耐點痛以外，當時我實在愛莫能助。眼睜睜的看見許多人因此半途而廢，心中十分的難受。</p>
<p>業務之暇，我乃熱誠地研究這個問題，并試用各種藥品。於是我在西方醫學先進各國的新發明中，吸收到了培補戒煙法。這種方法所據的學理是這樣的：吸煙成癮的原因在雅片的麻醉性，吸食旣久，體內的細胞全像吃醉了似的，麻木無力，不能照舊運行；不得不賴雅片的刺激，以促期活動，保持生命的存續。所以理想的戒煙法以直接恢復全體細胞之活力爲第一着，若能使體內各系統，自動地按着常軌進行，便無需每天用雅片來刺激，煙癮便無立足餘地。爲達到這目的起見，須設法使生命的泉源旺盛，精力的來源旣暢，細胞就會活躍起來了。供給生命的泉源者爲生殖腺，所以培補戒煙法就使患者內服生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』，增强其生殖腺，使生命的泉源日趨豐富，沒有雅片吸入，也能精神勃發，通常發癮時出現的痛苦現象消滅無踪，在五六星期後即得安然戒絕。</p>
<p>有戒者劉子欽，年四十二歲，十五六歲已染惡癖，吸食二十餘年之久，經余投以大量『生殖素』，歷時一個半月，無痛戒絕，不思復吸，且精神發越，身體頓覺壯健云。</p>

<p>（二）　早洩陰萎兩月治愈</p>
<p>患者張成文，年卅一歲，四川人。（主訴）——早年縱慾無度，致性能喪失殆盡。加之靑春時耽溺手淫，故時有遺精症，廿五歲結婚以來，幾每日受早泄，陰萎所窘，雖曾服藥挽救，總不能根治痊癒，今春三月，自來求治。（診時癥狀）——生殖腺已失却其發揮性慾的能力，遺精頻繁，腦弱，肌瘦，一切完全陷入極度衰老之境。（治療之法）——診得張君病源由於生殖腺受害過甚，致性能喪失，必須培固其生殖腺，其補充內分泌，促進其新陳代謝的機能。乃爲之服以『希米脫氏固精片』使遺精停止，精關治固。同時投以大量生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』使生殖腺轉弱爲强，內分泌充旺，治療兩月，遺精，早洩，陰萎完全治好，至今五月，未見復發。</p>

<p>— 香港大學醫科學士吳大超</p>
<p>……乳峯高聳的健美女性不易衰老</p>
<p>生殖腺的壯實與否，對於女性們有非常重大的意義。若是壯實的說話，發育必佳，臀部肥大，曲線優美，乳房豐腴高聳，精神活潑，皮膚紅潤，皺紋不易顯出，年齡雖大，也不大會呈衰老的樣子。并且這種女子月經準確，卵子活潑，很易受孕。</p>
<p>反之，萎弱的生殖腺使發育不能完美，臀部乳房，往往平坦得像男人般的，毫無美感。且身體旣弱，精神每懨懨無生氣，皮膚乾枯，一到二十六七歲，已有皺紋，呈着老態。月經紊亂，常有白帶，不易受孕。</p>
<p>衰老不美，絕嗣不姙，這種惡運，女性總要設法打破，以求駐顏種子。女性殖腺素製劑『女用生殖素』正是她們的救星。本劑係採取少壯雌性動物的生殖腺素精華製成，能使萎弱的生殖腺立變壯實，於是發育重新進行，乳房高聳起來，臀部突出，皺紋變平，明明一個乾癟枯瘦的弱女子，於最短期內，立變爲健美的現代女性。</p>
<p>我不曾說過衰弱的女子常有白帶嗎？那也不可忽略，應自行外用『療帶靈』作坐藥，立卽可以除盡；不過白帶每因染得淋病而起，如果是的，須兼服黃色素和伐克辛合製劑『安敵淋』</p>

<p>值得一看的來信</p>
<p>我屢次要提取筆來記述我骨痛的治愈始末，我想這是對於患者是多少有些俾益的。可是我疏於文墨，屢次鼓不起我的勇氣，直到現在，我的一位親戚施先生，他不幸也患了骨節酸痛症，經過我的介紹服藥，目下已告根治了。所以這一腔久欲一吐的事實，終於受到了勝利的興奮，勉强寫出了。</p>
<p>可笑，我不能舞文弄墨，所以從簡單的原則下寫吧！當初我的骨痛病象，是骨節酸楚，有時麻木拘　，計之已歷六年了，我現在不到四十歲，這樣年紀，竟患了這種病，眞是言之痛心，在此六年中我曾吃遍了關於骨痛的藥片，總時輕時重，時愈時發，直至上年冬季，我正發作劇烈的事候，我的一位親戚董致遠先生來看我了，他問我曾吃過『强斯登氏骨痛片』嗎？我搖搖頭。他說快去買來，同時他說：確具祛瘋，除濕，淸血及預防動脈硬化的功效，後來我　服了，果然疼痛立止，骨節輕鬆，腰背爽適，眞奇怪，到今未嘗一發，（信長從略）</p>

<p>— 史楫</p>
<p>綏邊告警的消息傳來之後，援綏的聲浪也就響澈雲霄，這其中可歌可泣的故事實在太多了，眞有罄竹難書之槪。例如慈谿　孀的傾家紓難，是其一例；北平的學生們冒了市府給他們的妨害秩序的大罪，依舊進行其援綏運動，又是一例；蕪湖的小學生爲了援綏募捐，而莫名其妙的遭人痛毆，更是一例；至於素來爲大人先生們所不齒的販夫走卒，情願多挨些餓，多受些凍的省上幾個銅子來聊表寸心，那更是普遍又普遍的事情。中華民族的决不至於淪亡，在這些地方不僅使我們看到了一些端倪，並且在這些地方給了我們一個保證！</p>
<p>但在舉國一致的紛起救亡中，某些大人先生們則在玩着所謂「護國救災法會」的把戲。「護國救災法會」發起的時候，是在匪僞侵綏之前，那時候冀察正是很緊急的時候，「護國」也正是當務之急；至於「息災」，今年各地雖然豐收，但是如臯一帶的惡性瘧疾却非常猖獗，而豐收之後農民們是否能就卽安居樂業，也的確是頗堪疑問的。這時候來一下旣「護國」又「息災」的法會，自然是非常合乎時令的。</p>
<p>且也，據說今年各地的豐收，其原因就因爲不久之前曾經舉行過一次丙子息災法會，所以才有現在的五穀豐登。豐收呢，是事實；所謂丙子息災法會，在不久之前也的確舉行過，因之，要把兩者連系起來看成爲因果，那自然也衹好悉聽尊便了。但因之也使我們想到了其它，要是我們並不如那些「居士」「法師」之流般的健忘，我想是也一定能想得起來的。舉個例來說吧！例如轟轟烈烈比丙子息災法會盛大過十百們，由活佛親自主持的金剛扶輪法會，那盛况到現在便還沒有被我們所忘記。然而這盛大的法會到現在已好幾年了，幾年來的中國，却還是「國難嚴重」。不僅「嚴重」，現在寫起來並且應該是國難日亟了。</p>
<p>但雖然是「國難日亟」大人先生們所發起的什麼法會却儘是花樣翻新的在層出不窮的舉行着。輪到這一次，打起的新旗幟是名之曰「護國息災法會」了，也正好這時候恰值匪僞侵綏，而且由於將士的忠勇，和後方民眾的精神上物質上的援助，打了勝仗。</p>
<p>打了勝仗，和「護國息災法會」兩件事附合起來，「護國息災法會」自然又有莫大功勞了，但正當我也這麼以爲着的時候，却在　上看到一段關於該會的速寫：</p>
<p>『……當他們走進一間供列着許多多長生祿位位牌的房子裏時，法師睜圓法眼，很出神地望着那些牌位嘰哩咕嚕地唸咒。据那社一位和尚說，這些長生祿位牌子，分二元和十元兩種價錢，花錢買這牌子的人只要能得法師的法眼在他牌子上一望，便可消災延壽了。……』</p>
<p>我這才恍然大悟，知道所謂「護國息災」，原來是這麼一回事，而在這樣的「護」「息」下，最要緊的還得要二元乃至十元錢。至於二元和十元之間又有怎樣的區別？愧非「法師」或「居士」，而那位記者先生又沒有寫出來，那又無從知道了。但二元與十元的區別雖不知道，「法師」及發起該會的名流們的好處一定有甚於此者，想來那是一定的。不然，熱心奔走豈非白費？而屢屢的興建法壇，豈豐更屬多事之至！</p>
<p>「護國」是個好題目，頻年在災禍相尋下掙扎過活着，息災」也是個好題目，而化了二元錢就能消災延壽，那更是再也便宜不過的「善舉」，法會舉行時的信徒甚眾，那是無怪其然的，想見發起的名流們及主持的法師，見到許許多多的長生祿位時的喜逐顏開，那副面容一定頗堪耐味的吧。遇得意人少說掃興話，這世故我是懂得的，這時候如果來說利他利己，小我大我，未免太不識趣；欲說無從，那麼不如就此擱筆。</p>

<p>— 路直</p>
<p>向海邊走去的時候，濃霧就將我們包圍着，濕濕的，帶着鹹味的，細雨似的霧，一陣陣捲上塘岸，不知從什麼地方來，到什麼地方去，一片白。太陽像浮在霧中的一盞白磁燈。</p>
<p>塘上行人只有我和鄭寶，都走得倦了。一路上穿過許多鹽滷坑，煮鹽棚和村莊，遇到許多橫過塘岸，拿了竹片去拾蛤貝的小姑娘和孩子，好容易走完長塘，拐了個灣，才到鄭寶的親戚家。</p>
<p>走進稀落的村莊，幾條狗圍住我們呌，拍了很久門，還只有狗呌。</p>
<p>鄭寶怕我心焦，說：「這樣早不會出去的。」實在兩個人都走倦了，想休息，遇不到人，都有些抱怨。</p>
<p>「噢，鄭寶哥，是你……去，去，殺死你，（對狗說。）我們當了誰，眞是嚇壞人。」隔壁有兩家莊稼人打扮的老年人出來，其中一個很熱情地說。</p>
<p>「徐福官他家嗎？」鄭寶急急的問。</p>
<p>「不在家！」那兩個男子對我望，充滿了懷疑的。</p>
<p>「這是我的朋友，因爲他想遊乍浦，看燒鹽，所以我和他來找福官。」</p>
<p>那兩個人沒答覆，靜靜的帶我們從後門轉進宅子去。一路趕去，追住我們的狗。</p>
<p>「福官這樣早出去了？他的媽呢？嫂嫂呢？」鄭寶問。</p>
<p>「哈……哈……（苦笑）他們才在燒鹽，煮菜沒了鹽，想乘大霧，看不出烟，燒些吃吃，平常他們都不敢的。……想不到你來，兩件大衣，我們當捉私的來了，告訴他們，都逃掉了。」</p>
<p>「逃了？」我們兩個下意識析重覆了一名。</p>

<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>坐在又是灶間又作客廳的屋裏，雖然光錢很暗，霉氣一陣陣冒起冲着鼻子，都覺得到了家裏似的安定了。我們都沒說話，看着沒塗灰的墻壁，壁上兩張滑稽粗糙的「和東洋人打杖」的畫。灶旁一隻大竹碗橱，都敗壞了，彷彿一碰就要破散了的。這一家還是上好的人家呢，我眞有些不信任鄭窴的話。</p>
<p>坐得厭了，我們轉出後門，走近竹園子，忽然看到那邊有烟和水蒸氣冒着。一隻二尺見方的洋鐵盤倒在地上，盤下是用石塊壘成的一隻方灶，還有火熱着。</p>
<p>「這就是他們燒的鹽吧！」我發覺了秘密似的說。</p>
<p>「你看這裏好燒幾斤？」鄭窴老成地問我。</p>
<p>「二三斤罷！」我說。</p>
<p>這時我聽到急遽的脚步聲，一個近三十歲紫臉膛瘦瘦的人跑了進來。</p>
<p>「呵，竇弟，什麼風吹來的？……嚇壞我了，眞呌千日不偷，一做就破案。……呵，這一位先生，請進去坐，這裏太髒了。」</p>
<p>我們坐定，他急忙去取水，燒火，煮茶給我們喝。「你們二班車來的？早班來就好了，那樣早我們不會疑心的。」</p>
<p>我覺得抱歉，不該使這老實人吃這虛驚。我也怪異他們為什麼這麼害怕。你燒這一點吃都不成？」</p>
<p>「不成，就半斤都要罰三四塊錢呢！這呌規矩。」他笑着，露出一口焦黃不平的牙齒。氣喘還沒有停息。</p>
<p>「罰不出呢？」我問，問後我駡自己太蠢了。</p>
<p>「還不是挨打，坐牢。」　嘆了氣說</p>
<p>「現在鹽不燒了麼？」鄭窴問。「他想來看燒鹽的。」</p>
<p>「後准燒呵，公倉存鹽太多了。怕燒私。」</p>
<p>茶煮好了，像黃洩，一股鹽味。我正端着茶杯時，兩個女人從後門跌似地走了進來，一雙小脚只有三寸大，一雙大脚穿了布鞋，爛泥直汚到大腿。看到鄭窴，他們都强作笑臉的說：「窴官，什麼風呵，你看你大姨和你嫂嫂，變兩個泥菩薩了。……我跌了三交。」</p>
<p>坐的椅子彷彿有刺，我怎麼亦安不下心跳，借了要到海鹽去的藉口，我拉了鄭窴離開了這善良的家。一路上我們更沒有話說了。</p>
<h3 id="c201">「漢奸」舊說新證 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 汶</p>
<p>何謂「漢奸」意義至明，無煩細說，賣國者是。然而在某種塲合，也有因為觀者不同，而以漢奸為非漢奸，以非漢奸為漢奸的。比如，到長春，到冀東，去喊救國，一定被目為「奸細」無疑，而非加殺戮或逮捕不可的。這就是明證。於是，漢奸之義，乃需有一番更精細的解釋了。</p>
<p>翻翻手邊，有一本第四期的中流雜誌，內載有鄭振鐸先生一篇「選文小記」，他在選錄晚淸文字中，發現了不知姓名作者的「漢奸辨」一文，那是登載於淸朝末年秘密革命刋物「黃帝魂」上的。這對於漢奸定義，大有精細的說明。於今黑白難分之世，這文重行公之於世，有極大意義。因不避重複，再轉錄之於下：</p>
<p>所謂眞漢奸者，助異種害同種之謂也。敎進乒之管敢，　石勒滅晋晋之張托，以父事契丹之石敬塘，率犬羊殘同類之趙　壽，為元滅宋之張宏範，扶淸滅明之吳三桂，耿繼茂，尙可喜，助滿洲殲滅太平王之會國藩，左宗棠，李鴻章等，今日之死漢奸也……至滿洲人之所謂漢奸者，乃漢族中之偉人碩士，卽為愛同類之故，甘心戎首，雖犧牲其身而不顧，如漢武帝時楚殺匈奴之霍去病，衛靑輩，宋朝之岳飛，近代之太平王洪秀全，烈士唐才常，林述唐等……敬吿漢人，愼母為害己之漢奸，當為愛己之漢奸……不必以異族人之目我為漢奸，遂長漢奸之名而為之諱也。鄭先生註云：「在那時候，滿洲官吏對於革命黨人，常給以漢奸的頭銜，故作者有此辨」。這對於誰是眞正的漢奸，何謂漢奸，已說得再淸楚沒有。辨別的標準是：誰為率犬羊以殘同類，誰為愛同類而甘心戎首犧牲其身而不顧？</p>
<p>敵人以明槍明砲來。人人得而見之，最可怕的是：用汝漢族，以殺汝漢族。這在敵人的錦囊妙計中，是名之曰：「以華制華」。綏東作亂的所謂偽軍，不同是中國之入嗎？擴而大之，敵人有形無形的雇用劊子手，眼前正不知有若干之多。自己殺得起勁，敵人旁觀而收其漁利，寃氣冲天，到頭來殺的都是自己人。鄭先生在「選文小記」中云「他們所說的話，至今還有一部分是有用……讀了他們在二三十年前所發表的憤激的鼓動民族精神的文章，眞不禁還覺得並非過時之作」。我說：「在昔已然，於今為烈」！</p>
<p>記得不久以前，蔣委員長在洛陽軍分校中演詞有云：「要復興民族，先要消滅國內漢奸」（大意）。因引舊說，以證新事。</p>
<h3 id="c202">糖 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 田舍</p>
<p>因為幾隻蛀牙的不時要疼痛，所以對那些甜的東西終於緣薄，卽使是高貴的朱古律和時髦的留蘭香，在我亦祗成為玩宣品而已。那七色橡皮印的錦盒，錦盒面透過玻璃紙的美利堅的田園書，一羣活潑天眞的孩童在農塲上追趕着火雞的姿態，板屋門前的曬衣架，遠道上的兩輸馬車，吸着烟草的中年農夫，和馬背上的陽光……。一條長虹似的，耕色或湖綠色的綢帶，斜橫過畫面，緊緊地在錦盒角打了個蝶結。朱古律的素樸色是得着我的好感的。</p>
<p>這次，在黛安餞別我的禮品中，有這麼一盒，「高貴的玩賞品。呵。悄悄地從內心興起口福的悲哀了。從甜蜜的朱古律中是含有一些焦苦味的，能誘惑我的食慾，還是這從隱的中體味到的焦香。幾年來，心和生活的煆煉，已染上了朱古律的色和味，一種赭色的樸素，一種苦澀的焦香，緊緊地使我留戀，而甜味終於與我綠薄，這又該怨自己已往的過嗜糖食，把一口牙齒糟壞。</p>
<p>回到家裏，把糖分送給孩子，而自己僅僅保留了那隻錦盒，然而，當孩子們剝開晶亮的錫紙，見到那硬硬的一塊時，便瞪着小圓眼發牛了疑惑；「這是什麼呵？沒有一些芝麻和玫瑰。」生活在鄉村的孩子對於都市的物質文明一向隔絕，在都市裏認為貴品的，到鄉村去祗博得了一點疑惑和渺視。正和穿西裝下鄉被罵猴子一樣，卽使心坎充溢着幾許憤慨和寃屈，也祗得默默地忍受。在鄉村裏，芝麻糖的地位要比朱古律好得多。</p>
<p>當午後的太陽成直線照落在寂寞的院子時，會有一種沙啞的，聽去很覺費力的呌賣聲，隨着鐵片互擊的音響，令人不備地闖進了村巷。很熟悉，卽使如我這難得回來的遊子，亦知道是那賣芝麻糖的老頭子又來了。「買芝麻糖來，爛東西換芝麻糖來玫瑰焦鹽芝麻糖吃晆！」把一些孩子從高高低低的門口裏引誘出來了。老頭子，糖擔，被圍困在宗祠的照牆前，他有着瘦削的三角臉，濕潤的眼眶凝固着沒神彩的眼球，頸項很長，暴露着兩支粗筋，當他抬頭高喊時，粗筋便變了紫色，血的紫色。</p>
<p>芝麻糖一支一支堆在盤裏，很整齊。盤擱在篾筐上，筐裏雜亂扔了點破布爛棉絮，他的生活大部份是從破爛中找覓來的。人家所遺棄的生活之殘餘，正成為他唯一的生命的源泉了。</p>
<p>小侄子們扯者我的衣角，把我拖到糖擔前，指指盤裏的芝麻糖，我早識透他們小小的心意了。老頭子陌生地對我微笑，把希望的視線頻頻向我擲繫。也不知有了多少年，沒和故鄉的糖擔做過交易，沒吃過故鄉的鬆脆的芝麻糖，沒和許多同夥在一起同糖販胡鬧，這些情形雖遠隔年代，可是從恍惚的回憶中，我又同返到自己已逝的童年似的，我的牙齒好像沒有蛀，常買糖給我的三老爹還健康的活在人間，我還辨味得出焦鹽和玫瑰，而並未忘掉二哥老把自己的名份吃完，再到我手裏來搶的憤恨。</p>
<p>可是眼前的孩子羣裏已沒有我和二哥，三老爹的靈位早供進宗祠的木龕，許多陌生的孩子的臉吿訴了我；這又是一代的生命了。我站在糖擔前，不知是快樂，還是悲哀？連自己的威覺亦陡的糢糊了。</p>
<p>「叔叔，買。叔叔，買。」小侄子們的催促，又使我醒覺。打袋裏掏出銅子買了幾支芝麻糖分派了，他們帶跳帶奔的竄進屋子去。「嘿嘿嘿……你先生眞是歡喜孩子的。」這句意料不到的話從賣糖老頭子枯澀的喉間迸出，「唔……」這用鼻音的回答我疑心不是我自己的。我目送着他把重重的糖擔挑上肩，傴僂着背脊，一步一步過去，終於消滅在巷底，他要走完那未盡的生活路。</p>
<p>回進屋子，我呆呆地望着桌上的那隻朱古律錦盒，蛀牙又在隱隱作痛……</p>

<p>今日大光明　國泰同時公映</p>
<p>二十世紀福斯公司出品的「小孤星」Dimples，係秀蘭鄧波兒最新傑作。該片寫一無父無母的孤兒，倚賴着她那不事上進的老祖父，苦度生活。這位老祖父，雖然是非常愛着他的孫女，但是他自己却賦有喜歡瞎三話四，摸東摸西的特性。秀蘭雖然苦勸他也沒有用，但是秀蘭愛她祖父的熱忱，終未稍减，後來雖有一富婦，願獻乃祖數千金，把秀蘭帶去扶養，秀蘭終因不忍離開她的祖父而終止。後來她的演戲的天才，給一個戲劇家發現了，開始舞台生活，在登台的一天，乃祖因為一度的欺騙行為，將被捉將官裏，但是結果那原吿，受了她那眞切表演的感動，竟放棄一切了。在本片中，不但秀蘭的表演巧妙，而飾老祖的弗蘭克毛根，亦有驚人的收獲。國泰兩大戲院同時開映云。</p>

At the same time, over two thousand troops of a certain National Army and more than thirty airplanes are stationed in Shangdu city. Constant skirmishes have been occurring along the Xinghe border in recent days, with heavy casualties among the bandits. From yesterday morning until noon, the fighting near Shangdu was fierce. Groups of three to five puppet aircraft constantly took off from Pingdiquan, conducting high-altitude reconnaissance. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sui Telegram: According to intelligence reports, the puppet bandit army has been extremely busy with troop movements between Duolun, Kangbao, and Shangdu in recent days, urgently preparing for war.

In recent days, various troops have been purchasing food in their respective locations. It is rumored that all bandit-puppet forces will launch a third general offensive against Sui ten days from now, and a fierce battle is not far off. Furthermore, a certain side dispatched 140 Chinese traitors, who one day disguised themselves and secretly went to Taolin and Xinghe in eastern Sui from Shangdu, plotting to sabotage a certain most solid defense project and wartime communication lines of the National Army. The National Army has heard the news and is on strict alert. Demchugdongrub is currently under the threat and lure of a certain side and is determined to reorganize his forces and act as a puppet again. He will lead his troops westward in the coming days. Office personnel in various counties of northern Chahar, hearing that the National Army will conduct suppression operations, are all afraid and fleeing. A certain side ordered puppet bandits to prevent this. Currently, up to 500 military trucks are being used, rushing around busily every day. Furthermore, two units of the Rehe army passed through Baochang and opened towards northern Sui on the 2nd. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

In recent days, over two thousand troops of the puppet army led by Li Shouxin have been secretly transported from Zhangbei to the Hetao area. Over ten thousand puppet troops from Rehe have arrived in Zhangbei in the last two days. Due to insufficient housing for civilians in the area, half of them are stationed in the Gubao area.

<p>(Nanjing) Information from related sources: Reports indicate that the bandits and puppets are under pressure from a certain side and there is talk of counterattacking Bailingmiao. According to observation, this may be a feint by a certain side. (2nd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Recently, a reporter who took the route from Suiyuan via Datong to reach here stated regarding the Chinese army's capture of Bailingmiao last week: "This battle was indeed a truly fierce battle. The Chinese side suffered approximately 300 casualties. The 'Manchukuo' Mongol army suffered more casualties, about 700, and abandoned over 400 Murata rifles. No less than 300 were captured by the Chinese army. The day after the capture of Bailingmiao, many airplanes fiercely bombed the area. The Chinese army currently guarding the temple is prepared for a major battle, anticipating that the enemy will definitely try to recover the area."

<h3 id="e6">Failure to Harass Sui, Mastermind Attempts Suicide, A Certain Chief of Staff Tries Hard to Reconcile, Ishiwara Arrives in Jiabusi Yesterday <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Reliable information: Regarding the failure to harass Sui, a certain military headquarters outside the Pass is blaming Tanaka Ryukichi, the Chief of Staff who has always advocated for a moderate approach. Because Tanaka participated in the January 28th Incident, he is known among young officers as an expert on Chinese military affairs. The Sui affairs plan was mostly under his leadership. Now, due to the defeat of the Mongol puppet army, Tanaka is ashamed to face people and wants to commit suicide by seppuku. A certain Chief of Staff outside the Pass prevented him, fearing that Tanaka's death would leave him, as his superior, with no way to face his countrymen. He is now trying hard to get a certain military headquarters inside the Pass to act in unison. However, a certain commander believes that the economic development agreement has been signed and that he has already made achievements individually, and does not want to get involved in more matters. Ishiwara, the operations section chief, conveyed the results of the order in Tianjin. The commander only agreed to take a proactive monitoring attitude and would not participate in other matters. Ishiwara arrived in Jiabusi on the 2nd to meet with Demchugdongrub for consultation. A certain Chief of Staff outside the Pass is waiting for news, and the military mobilization order is still hesitant and has not been issued. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Ba Wenjun, director of the Mongolian Political Council's Beijing office, said that Damiling Sulong, the general manager of the Eastern Sui Mongolian banner and commander of the four banners' bandit suppression, has a headquarters in Pingdiquan. He has not received a telegram recently, or has he personally gone to the Eastern Sui front. Bailingmiao is a vital passage for east-west transportation in Inner Mongolia, and the bandit puppet army's attempt to counterattack is inevitable. However, the front-line troops have made sufficient preparations, and the enemy will have difficulty succeeding. Outside Bailingmiao, there are also places such as Daqinggou, Shibaizitai, and Guitouzhuang in the middle of Shangdu Pingdiquan, which are also important. He also received a letter from the secretary-general of the Sui Provincial Government, informing him that there have been several instances of bandit puppet troops defecting every day recently, which is a good phenomenon in the front. A telegram from Taiyuan stated: First, Demchugdongrub took up arms without authorization. After the failure of the Bailingmiao battle, a certain side did send a guard to protect him back to Pangjiang, and his attitude was quite negative. Second, a certain side, having lost Bailingmiao, which had been arranged for a long time, is definitely unwilling to give up. They are now using Demchugdongrub as a banner, and sending a large number of senior advisors and senior staff officers and commanders to Pangjiang Demchugdongrub's Mansion to discuss strategies to counterattack Bailingmiao. Third, north of Bailingmiao, the snow is more than three feet deep, making it difficult for the puppet bandit troops stationed in Shangdu to invade south. They have now changed their plan, sending large units to invade Taolin and Xinghe via Daqinggou. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e25">The Chief Secretary of the Luoyang Headquarters Talks About the Future Changes in the Sui War: Our Side Aims to Preserve Territorial Integrity and Sovereignty, If the Bandits and Puppets Continue to Harass, We Will Launch a Full-Scale Attack, The Abnormality of the Encroachment on Territorial Sovereignty Hopefully Will Be Eliminated Soon <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>(Luoyang) On the 2nd, a reporter from the Ta Kung Pao interviewed the chief secretary of the local headquarters and asked how the war in eastern Sui would change in the future. According to the answer, after the bandit puppet army suffered setbacks, the front has recently been quiet. Furthermore, the local area is experiencing snowstorms and has entered a severely cold winter, so there are no special actions. Our side's operational policy is based on preserving territorial integrity and sovereignty. Therefore, from the beginning, we have adopted an offensive defense approach, always preparing for battle and launching attacks. If the bandit puppet army still occupies the area and continues to harass it, we will definitely launch a full-scale attack, regardless of any sacrifice. It is natural for the Chinese army to defend Chinese territory, and we will not allow any party to interfere with any excuse or threat. What the government hopes is that the abnormality of the encroachment on territorial sovereignty will be eliminated soon, and no other complex situations will occur. Then all issues should still be resolved reasonably through proper channels, etc. (2nd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Commander-in-Chief Jiang recently instructed Ningxia, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Sichuan, Suiyuan, Gansu, and Guizhou provinces, stating roughly: After verifying the implementation of opium prohibition, a six-year plan has long been established. However, opium prohibition begins with the prohibition of planting, which must be carried out simultaneously with the prohibition of transportation, sale, and consumption, so as to match supply and demand. The opium-producing counties in each province have been approved to reduce planting year by year, limited to the winter of the sixth year of the Gansu era (used for Ningxia, Shaanxi, and Yunnan) and the eighth year of the Gansu era (used for Suiyuan, Gansu, Guizhou, and Sichuan), and completely prohibited. Now, the fifth year of the Gansu era is approaching the end. The deadline for the province's prohibition is also approaching. Whether there are still opium seedlings planted in the counties and districts that have already been prohibited and those that should be prohibited this winter, and whether local officials at all levels have neglected the prohibition order and protected and condoned opium planting should be thoroughly enforced by the provincial government in accordance with the opium prohibition plan. Even in the counties that are slowly prohibiting it, they can only temporarily plant on the land where opium was planted last year, with the people reporting registration and obtaining permits. The number of acres and output must be strictly reduced according to the records at the end of last year. After that, it should be reduced year by year. It is not allowed to increase arbitrarily in order to seek tax revenue. Those who have not planted opium before, even in the counties and districts with slow prohibition, are not allowed to report and plant. Every planting season, the situation of opium farmers who have been prohibited from planting in the original opium-planting counties changing to planting food crops, and the number of acres registered for planting opium and the amount of output in the counties with slow prohibition, as well as comparing the amount reduced from the previous year, should be reported separately for assessment.

Matsumuro is scheduled to leave Ping within days. The vacancy will be filled by Colonel Matsui, the current commander of the Japanese army stationed in Yuguan.

The Chinese side now believes that Japan's appointment of a relatively low-ranking officer this time is because the focus of the Sino-Japanese incident has shifted to Nanjing.

<h3 id="e48">Review of the Revised Publication Law <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>In July of last year, the Legislative Yuan passed the new Publication Law, which greatly increased restrictions on the publishing industry. After petitions from the national press, the law was revised again by the Legislative Yuan. It was finally reviewed and completed by the Legislative Yuan on November 27 and sent to the National Government for promulgation. The revised Publication Law is somewhat more enlightened than the one promulgated last year. On the other hand, the government has added many new restrictions to the news business. Under the two principles of freedom of speech and national discipline, it is very difficult to have a perfect law. The legislative authorities may consider this "neutral and peaceful," while the press may consider it too much interference. If there is only negative restriction and no active support or guidance, it may not be easy for the government to achieve the effect of unifying public opinion and promoting the newspaper industry.</p>
<p>These 59 articles of the new Publication Law stipulate nothing more than two things. First, newspapers, magazines, and other publications must complete registration procedures with the government. Second, content that is detrimental to the interests of the Party and the country, social order, and good customs is not allowed to be recorded after publication. The new Publication Law differs from the one promulgated last year in only a few points. In terms of benefiting the press, the first is that the competent authority for publications was originally the county government or the municipal social bureau. The new law assigns the power of enforcement to the municipal government and the provincial government. The county government, etc., is only responsible for forwarding and temporary disposal. Newspapers in provincial capitals are directly managed by the provincial government. Second, the old law prohibited the publication of personal and family privacy. The new law merged this point into the item of good customs, and the punishment is also milder. Third, the items that should be filled in during registration have also been reduced compared to the old law. For example, there is no need to report on the editorial and publishing plan or the source of funding. It is only necessary to declare the amount of capital and the economic situation. Fourth, regarding the method of correction, the old law required newspapers to publish a correction letter of the same size as the original text. The new law has removed the word "same" and restored the word "appropriate" in the current Publication Law. Finally, the new law stipulates that if a newspaper is subject to administrative punishment and files a lawsuit, the government office must make a decision on the appeal within ten days. This was also not included in the old case.</p>
<p>The new law has added several restrictions to the news industry. The first is the restriction on advertisements. If the person publishing the advertisement has an announcement or advertisement that violates the interests of the Party and the country, social order, and good customs, they will also be punished. The second is the restriction on news agencies. When necessary, the local competent authorities may send personnel to inspect the affairs and distribution status of news agencies. The third is the restriction on news practitioners. If they have violated the Publication Law or have been criminally punished for corruption, fraud, or other acts, they will lose the qualification to publish or edit newspapers. Furthermore, when publications are published, in addition to sending copies to the Ministry of the Interior and the Propaganda Department in accordance with the current regulations, they must also be sent to the National Library, the local competent authorities, and the Legislative Yuan Library. These are all new burdens for the publishing industry. The newly added restrictions are in principle sympathetic, because the content of advertisements and the content of news agencies need to be improved. The restriction on practitioners also has the effect of improving the professional status of journalists. However, whether it is harmful or beneficial depends on how the law is enforced.</p>
<p>Our government accepted the request of the press and revised the Publication Law again. It has made considerable concessions to the points raised by the press, which is of course commendable. However, if we think that such a passive and simple law will have a great effect, it would be overly optimistic. The Chinese news business is still in its infancy, and it faces many difficulties. The government should adopt an attitude of supporting and encouraging it, and solve the various difficulties of the newspaper industry. Public opinion circles will naturally actively move upward and get on the right track. Many unsatisfactory newspapers are forced to publish scandalous news and useless advertisements because of unstable economic foundations, lack of talent, and difficult environments. At present, white paper and ink are so expensive, the source of advertisements is so meager, the hard news that can be published is so lacking, distribution is so restricted, the people's wisdom is so low, society does not value journalists, and the government does not protect journalists. The government should try to solve all these problems so that excellent newspapers have the possibility of flourishing. But relying on official registration and partial inspection will only allow foreign newspapers and foreign news agencies that do not register and are not inspected to run rampant in China. The result of the Publication Law runs counter to the original intention of the Publication Law. This is a point that we hope the government authorities will pay attention to.</p>

<p>(London) Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi recently gave a speech to the press, stating that Chinese public opinion on the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact can be summarized as follows: (1) In addition to what has been officially announced, it is feared that there are other secret clauses in this agreement. (2) The wording of the agreement is vague and may induce other countries to sign and join it. An Asian country has now joined a European group, and international disputes have added a new crisis, which is regrettable. (3) China is determined to suppress communism on its own and does not need to rely on other countries. In addition, Ambassador Guo also said that it is hoped that the anti-communist agreement concluded between Germany and Japan will not harm China's interests. (2nd Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the respect for Japan's vested interests in Abyssinia and the understanding between Japan and Italy on the establishment of consulates, the Japanese Foreign Ministry, after consultation with the Italian government, issued the following statement at 8:00 PM on the 2nd (noon Rome time):</p>
<p>The Government of the Empire of Japan hereby informs the Italian Government of its intention to close its embassy in Abyssinia and to open a consulate in Addis Ababa. The Italian Government respects the Empire's trade and other interests in Abyssinia and will give them favorable consideration. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the evening of the 2nd, stating that the Japanese government has notified the Italian government that Japan is preparing to close its embassy in Abyssinia and to establish a consulate in Addis Ababa. The Italian government has also agreed to respect Japan's commercial and other interests in Abyssinia and to give them special consideration. The above announcement intentionally avoids mentioning the agreement between Italy and "Manchuria" regarding the establishment of an Italian consulate-general in Shenyang, but it is issued simultaneously in a separate written statement, stating that this matter has nothing to do with Japan's establishment of a consulate in Abyssinia. One of the most noteworthy points in this statement is that although there are currently no political negotiations underway, it is a well-known fact that Japan and Italy are working to cultivate friendly relations between the two countries through cooperation in culture and other fields. (Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding Japan's recognition of the Italian Empire and Italy's de facto recognition of "Manchukuo," after the two sides agreed to issue separate announcements, the Italian government issued the first announcement today, stating that "Japanese Ambassador Sugimura recently met with Foreign Minister Ciano and informed him that the government wished to change the embassy in Addis Ababa into a consulate-general and requested King Victor Emmanuel III, also Emperor of Abyssinia, to issue the necessary consular credentials. Foreign Minister Ciano expressed his gratitude for this move by the Japanese Imperial Government and assured Ambassador Sugimura that the Italian authorities would pay special attention to the interests held by Japan in Abyssinia. The second announcement, which announces the establishment of an Italian consulate-general in Changchun, the capital of 'Manchukuo,' will not be issued until a week later." (Havas News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e53">Japanese Statement; Solely of an Economic Nature <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry issued a statement at 8:00 PM on the 2nd, along with the following remarks: "Considering the changing situation in Abyssinia and the timing thereof, we deem it appropriate to abolish the Imperial Embassy in Abyssinia and establish a consulate. Therefore, at the end of June this year, we instructed our ambassadors in Europe to pay attention to the situation in Abyssinia and the movements of member states of the League of Nations. As a result of negotiations with the Italian government, this has now come to fruition. The German government notified the Italian government on July 25 of this year that it would abolish its embassy in Abyssinia and establish a consulate-general, etc., and this was announced at the time. The Imperial Government's decision to establish a consulate this time, with the Italian government stating that it would give favorable consideration to the protection of commerce and other interests, is based on that statement. In order to adjust trade relations between Japan and Abyssinia, we expect to begin discussions. Apart from this, there are currently no political agreements being discussed between Japan and Italy. However, it is well known that the two countries are cultivating amicable relations through cultural exchange, etc. Furthermore, the Italian government and the government of 'Manchukuo' have been in consultation regarding the establishment of an Italian consulate in Shenyang, which is separate and unrelated to the establishment of a consulate in Abyssinia. This is added to avoid any misunderstanding." (Domei News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the conclusion of the agreement between Italy and Japan, Japan's commercial rights and interests in Abyssinia have been confirmed in principle. Therefore, Foreign Minister Arita will continue negotiations in Rome based on this general outline, and will proceed to conclude a commercial treaty based on this principle. The form of the agreement will be realized by an exchange of notes, but whether the procedure adopted will be to expand the area of application of the existing Italian-Japanese commercial treaty or to conclude a separate exchange of notes has not yet been decided. However, in preparation for the future economic development of Abyssinia, measures will be taken to ensure the promotion of Japanese commercial rights and interests. Currently, Japan's trade relations with Abyssinia are unclear due to the incompleteness of Abyssinian trade statistics, but if we combine imports through French Djibouti and through Indian merchants, rough goods such as coarse cloth are estimated at 10 million yuan. Therefore, ensuring this export volume will have an effect on trade. On the other hand, imports from Abyssinia are currently virtually nonexistent, and the region is very suitable for cotton cultivation. The Italian government is also gradually developing it according to plan. Therefore, the issue of securing cotton and other economic resources will also be included in the negotiations when concluding a commercial treaty in the future. As for the fact that Italy has newly established a consulate-general in Shenyang, and that Italy and "Manchukuo" will have a closer tendency, it is expected that this will have a positive impact on its commerce.

<h3 id="e54">Rome's Explanation; Using This to Connect East and West <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the agreement established between Italy and Japan, government officials recently declared that since Japan maintains important interests in East Africa, Italy and Japan have established an agreement of a commercial nature. Observers say that Italy had felt uneasy about the importance of Japan's interests in Abyssinia, which can be seen from Italy's protest when Abyssinia was not yet destroyed and it repeatedly granted privileges to Japan. As for what commercial interests Italy maintains in "Manchukuo," no opinion is expressed. Political observers say that although newspapers in various countries have expressed opposition since 1934 to the fact that Japanese goods are flooding European markets, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has not been moved. The agreement established between Italy and Japan this time is in line with this aim, because the Prime Minister has always advocated attaching importance to countries in the East that are progressing, and wants to use Italy as a medium to connect East and West. It is also remembered that when students from various Asian countries held a conference in Rome in 1933, the Prime Minister attended and gave a speech, saying, "Europe is no longer in a leading position among the continents. It can still save itself in the future, but it must find a reasonable way so that all countries in the world can understand each other." In addition, political figures also declared that Japanese Ambassador Sugimura contributed a great deal to the establishment of the agreement between Italy and Japan, and that he also advised his own government when Italy conquered Abyssinia, which was successful.

<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina - The Pan-American Peace Conference opened here today. Representatives from 21 countries attended. All South American countries participated. The U.S. President delivered the opening address, expressing his belief that the republics of the New World could assist the Old World in recovering from the scourge of war. It is heard that the participating delegations paid considerable attention to the suggestion of the influential American press corps that the American countries mediate the war in Spain. Although the matters to be debated will be limited to those included in the agenda, the former proposal may be discussed. The conference is expected to last until Christmas. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina - The Pan-American Peace Conference opened here today. U.S. President Roosevelt delivered the opening address as follows: "The countries of the Americas have thoroughly discussed the psychology of modern warfare. Mr. Roosevelt strongly criticized certain world forces, without explicitly naming them, and said that the civilians of the world all want to live their lives in peace. All those who are militaristic and aggressive are only their leaders and governments. Moreover, such foolish countries will inevitably use their destructive weapons to attack their neighbors, or fall into total collapse due to the country's economic exhaustion. When these two situations occur, even if the countries of the Americas are not drawn into the vortex of war, they will inevitably be affected. It should be known that when a great war occurs elsewhere, our happiness will be affected everywhere. Therefore, the republics of the Americas should assist the countries of the Old World in avoiding war. I am confident that this can be done.</p>
<p>First, we must prevent the countries of the Americas from fighting among themselves. The best way to do this is to consolidate the constitutional democratic political system. In this way, we can distinguish ourselves from the people under other political systems and strive to maintain a peaceful life. At the same time, we must cooperate closely so that when other countries driven mad by war try to invade us, they will discover that the countries of the Americas are prepared and ready to discuss and protect their security together. What concerns us most at present is any country that lacks social and political equality.</p>
<p>Mr. Roosevelt also strongly condemned the harm of trade barriers, saying that those countries that are trying their best to promote these methods are often those who advocate war as an instrument of policy. The modern countries that are superstitious about the theory of self-sufficiency often cause the intellectual standards of their people to decline, the concept of democracy to be lost, and their efforts to increase armaments to double. Due to the above-mentioned suicidal policies and the suffering they cause, most of their people, in despair, generate the negative idea that the cost of war is lower than the cost of peace."</p>
<p>Mr. Roosevelt continued, "The realization of peace cannot be achieved by empty words. It must be obtained through courageous and difficult efforts. Today, as the representatives gather here for this meeting, we should not disappoint the millions of people who are less fortunate than us. The countries that are across the sea from us are constantly cycling through old hatreds and new grievances. When there are unjust or unequal events, they are willing to resort to force rather than peaceful solutions, and believe that the only way to open up new overseas markets is to recover their land. We know that all parties are currently striving to expand armaments, and that millions of men and women must be employed to manufacture weapons. However, this phenomenon is false, and it cannot create a permanent structure. There is no so-called consumption." Mr. Roosevelt solemnly declared that the hope of the whole world still lies in democracy. If we continue to successfully promote it throughout the Americas, it will inevitably become more popular and will surpass all methods that we see as violating human freedom and progress. Mr. Roosevelt ended his speech and appealed in a religious tone, "Let us use our religious faith and spirit to make the peace of the Western Hemisphere increasingly consolidated, and may God help us so that our compatriots in other continents may also share the happiness of peace."</p>
<p>After Mr. Roosevelt finished his speech, he gave a speech at the request of the youth of Argentina, saying that when American youth welcome famous people, they often throw paper scraps, and when there is no paper to throw, they tear up telephone books and use the paper. The situation in Argentina seems to be slightly different, as they all use flowers instead of paper. The warm welcome from the people upon arriving in Argentina this time was the most honorable thing in his life. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina - When Mr. Roosevelt's speech lacked time, Justo's son Libro, the son of Argentine President Justo, shouted "Down with imperialism" in the field and was arrested by the police and expelled from the field.

<h3 id="e69">Spanish Rebels; Use Poison Gas to Fight; Intense Artillery Fire Followed by Melee; Attack on Madrid Unsuccessful <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Madrid - Our correspondent reports that the Nationalist army launched a large-scale attack on the city yesterday, which was the most fierce since the siege of the capital on the 25th of last month. The artillery used was mostly 155 mm caliber artillery, which fired a total of 1,500 shells in two hours. These shells are said to be poison gas shells, and many militiamen belonging to the government army were poisoned. They were immediately transported back to the rear for treatment. The authorities have not yet determined what kind of gas it is. Although the Nationalist army's offensive was fierce, the militiamen resisted without retreating, and finally repelled the Nationalist army and took advantage of the victory to occupy several important locations. Government officials were therefore quite satisfied. For example, (1) the hospital in the university district in the western suburbs, where the Nationalist army's brigade was stationed, has been destroyed by government artillery fire, but the remnants of the Nationalist army's foreign legion are still resisting and have not retreated. (2) The government army's counter-offensive in the towns of Pozuelo and Humera in the northwest suburbs has also made progress. (3) In the area of ​​Casate Gomba Park, the militiamen have occupied the town of Casate Gamada, and the Nationalist army is retreating towards the Garapites Mountains. In addition, the government army has sent 40 fighter planes to bomb the Nationalist army's lines and shot down several Nationalist army bombers. (Havas News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>Madrid - After the government army's counter-offensive won and repelled the rebels, the rebels suddenly bombarded fiercely with gas bombs. The government army was forced to retreat to the Pozuelo area. The rebels are now attacking the capital from the west. The two sides fought hand-to-hand overnight. The rebels claimed to have occupied the village of Boadilla. It is heard that 200 government troops were killed in this one place. Today, the government army attacked the old royal garden, Casa del Campo, with the aim of cutting off the connection between the rebel positions in Humera, Pozuelo, and the University City in the northwest. The rebels claimed to have repelled the attacking government army. The government army lost many people and three Russian-made tanks. The government army claimed that it had obtained a strong air force aid team last week. The number was not specified. It is widely believed that 90 military aircraft have arrived. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e71">On the Spanish Civil War, Britain Strictly Adheres to Neutrality: The Arms Embargo Bill Passes the House of Commons; German and Russian Intervention Actions Increase the Severity of the European Situation <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>(London) After lengthy debate in the House of Commons today, and after Sir Archibald Sinclair, leader of the Liberal Party, strenuously defended Soviet Russia, the government's motion to prohibit British ships from carrying arms or ammunition to Spain passed its second reading by a vote of 239 to 132. Before the vote, Conservative MP Mr. James, who had recently inspected Spain, gave a speech stating that both sides were receiving substantial assistance from foreign countries, and the war was no longer a Spanish civil war but had transformed into an international war fought on Spanish soil. When proposing the second reading, Board of Trade President Mr. Runciman stated that since Britain joined the non-intervention agreement, the transport of arms and ammunition to Spain had been completely prohibited. However, several British ships were still transporting munitions to Spain. The rebel side recently declared that they intended to use force to stop the maritime supply of arms to Spain. Spanish warships intercepting such British ships would constitute an act of force, searching them would be an insult, and confiscating them would be an act of violence. If they were granted belligerent rights, then we should allow them to stop and search British ships. Since they have not been granted these rights, we should still use the navy to protect British ships transporting munitions in violation of our stated policy. Once this bill becomes law, Spanish warships will no longer be able to interfere with British ships on the high seas under the pretext of intervention and will be resisted. Norway has followed Britain's example, and France is currently considering this action. Many members of parliament opposed this and raised many questions. Mr. Runciman replied that this measure does not apply to ships registered in the Dominions. He believed the navy would no longer protect ships violating the laws applicable to British merchant ships. Among the Dominions, only the Irish Free State has joined the non-intervention agreement. Whether there is any difference in not including Dominion ships is a matter of speculation. To the government's knowledge, no Dominion ships are sailing near Spain. Mr. Runciman finally urged the parliament to pass this bill in one day. Labour MP Mr. Peake moved to oppose the bill because Britain was the only country doing this, and the bill did not consider the point that British ships could transport munitions to Spain via Portugal. In British history, this bill is unprecedented. The government should consult with the governments of the various Dominions before making a decision. He heard the President of the Board of Trade say that ships that act on their own and violate British law by engaging in prohibited activities will not be protected by the British fleet. Labour is extremely concerned about the impact of this procedure. Labour also believes that this type of legislation should be determined after consultation with other governments that have joined the non-intervention agreement.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Mr. Eden then joined the debate, saying that the Admiralty had not issued an order not to protect Dominion ships, nor would it want to do so in the future. Therefore, Dominion ships would be protected by the British Navy. Currently, no Dominion shipping routes approach Spain. However, if we suspect that any Dominion ships are transporting munitions to Spain, we should notify the relevant government. We have no reason to believe that any Dominion will not cooperate with our non-intervention policy. For practical reasons, the Spanish war may at some stage grant belligerent rights to both sides. If the other signatories to the non-intervention agreement strictly adhere to the provisions of the agreement, the current situation would not have occurred, as no British ships would be sailing from foreign ports to transport munitions to Spain. We are now trying to stop British ships from transporting munitions from foreign ports, while ships from certain countries are still transporting munitions made in their own countries. We have obtained evidence that certain countries have violated the agreement. It is said that not including the point of transporting munitions to Portuguese ports within the scope of the prohibition is beneficial to the rebels. According to the International Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee, two cases accusing Portugal were not processed due to insufficient evidence. The British government has telegraphed the British representative in Lisbon to investigate everything, and his reply still states that no evidence has been obtained that the Portuguese government has violated the agreement. Those countries that have not adhered to the non-intervention agreement are not making a sincere contribution to European peace. The British representative to the committee will clarify our concerns on this issue tomorrow and will propose expanding the scope of the agreement to prohibit foreign volunteers from going to fight in Spain. Britain's adherence to neutrality allows its humanitarian work to proceed smoothly. The British Navy and consulates have rescued thousands of lives in the war zone, mostly because both sides believe that Britain is the most faithful and neutral of all European countries. Liberal Party leader Mr. Sinclair rose to defend Soviet Russia, saying that the amount of munitions that Soviet Russia transported to Spain before October 15 was limited. It was only when they saw that Italy and Germany were continuously supplying the rebels with munitions and soldiers that they began to supply the Spanish government in large quantities. Therefore, he was indignant at the fact that the Foreign Secretary's speech criticized Soviet Russia more severely than it criticized Portugal or Italy, considering it unfair. (Reuters dispatch, one day)</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding Spain's application for the League of Nations Executive Council to convene a temporary meeting, semi-official sources recently stated that the general situation is quite serious, but Italy has not given up hope for the fate of Europe as a whole. Previously, when Italy used force against Abyssinia, Prime Minister Mussolini did his best to prevent the Italo-Abyssinian War from spreading to Europe. Later, this promise was kept. Today, Italy's position is better than before, and it should continue to work to prevent the Spanish Civil War from turning into an international war, thereby avoiding a catastrophe for Europe.

<h3 id="e74">A Record of Inspecting Suiyuan (Continued): Our Troops in Eastern and Northern Suiyuan Have Very Solid Defense Lines; Captured a Great Deal of Military Supplies When Taking Bai Ling Miao <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Current Situation of Bai Ling Miao</p>
<p>After our army completely recaptured Bai Ling Miao at 9 AM on the 24th, Sui Chairman Mr. Fu Zuoyi held a banquet on the evening of the 25th for the comfort groups from Ping, Hu, Shanxi, and the Northeast. During the banquet, when Bai Ling Miao was mentioned, some representatives of the comfort groups immediately suggested that they would like to go and inspect and comfort the soldiers. Mr. Fu said that the traffic to the temple was extremely difficult, with many potholes, and he was concerned that everyone would not be able to bear the severe cold. However, if they insisted on going, the provincial government could provide transportation. Upon hearing this, the representatives decided to go at all costs and decided to depart early (26th) morning. The provincial government appointed Mr. Chen Zhiqu, an officer from the Department of Social Affairs, to accompany and take care of them. At 7 AM on the 26th, Mr. Chen led a large car provided by the provincial government to the Suiyuan Hotel. The car was an open-top type, covered with a canvas canopy and equipped with felt blankets inside. It departed from the hotel at about 9 AM, heading directly northwest. After traveling about 20 miles, passing Wugongba, it entered the Daqing Mountains. The climate suddenly turned cold, and the car had great difficulty traveling due to the high and low mountains. Although the representatives were thinly clothed, they still rallied their spirits to move forward. Because the car had a canopy to shield their view, they saw very little along the way. Although the distance from Suiyuan to the temple is said to be 360 miles, the distances in the outer areas have not been officially measured, so it is actually more than 400 miles. The group arrived in Wuchuan at 3 PM, where County Magistrate Chang Weixing, Garrison Brigade Commander Sun Lanfeng, and Chief of Staff Yuan Qingzeng came out to greet them. They were invited to lunch at the county government. After the meal, they continued north. At about 7 PM, they arrived at Erfenzijiao, where Garrison Division Commander Sun Changsheng and Deputy Division Commander Sun Weiming welcomed them. Mr. Sun said that it was late, and the weather was very cold, so it might be inconvenient to travel. He wanted to invite the representatives to get out of the car and rest, but the representatives were afraid that they would not be able to return the next day, so they decided to proceed slowly. Commander Sun, for the sake of safety along the way, used wireless telegraph to notify the garrison, using red and green lights as signals, and approved them to pass at any time. The car traveled for a short time, and it was already dark. The checkpoints along the way were very strict. From Erfenzijiao to the temple was only a 60-mile journey, but they took a wrong turn and detoured for more than 100 miles. It was not until 10:30 PM that they arrived at the temple. Regiment Commander Liu Jingxin, who was stationed at the temple, invited the representatives to stay at the former site of the Special Affairs Office. Everything in the room was as clean as before. Mr. Liu then ordered the preparation of white flour, large flatbreads, and pickles for everyone to eat together. After the meal, Mr. Liu called over several captured and surrendered bandits, and the representatives questioned them about their experiences as bandits and before and after the battle. It was midnight before they rested. Because of the cold and the lack of luggage, many people huddled or walked around the room, waiting for dawn. At about 5 AM on the 27th, the whole group went to the temple to visit. Around the temple were more than a thousand small white houses where the lamas lived. It was surrounded by mountains on all sides, and the temple was built in the western part of the square. At about 7 AM, Regiment Commander Liu prepared a dozen horses for the representatives to ride to the east and west mountain tops to visit the battlefield. The bandit corpses and dead horses abandoned in the battlefield were everywhere, and many had not yet been buried. The local Mongolian dogs were extremely fierce, so the bodies of people and horses were mostly torn and chewed, and were in a state of disrepair. The fortifications abandoned by the bandits on each mountain top were all made of stone. The group returned to the temple at 9 AM. Because the bandit planes came to bomb the temple every day at 10 AM, and there were still four planes that came to drop bombs the day before the group arrived at the temple, everyone took the original army car back at 9 AM. The wind and sand were stronger than when they came, and the yellow sand hit their faces, causing excruciating pain. It was not until about 8 PM that night that they returned to Guihua. Bai Ling Miao is located in the northwest of Sui Province and is an important military area. If it fell into the hands of the bandits, Suiyuan would be under threat at all times. The bandits also regarded the temple as a base for going west to Baotou and south to harass Suiyuan. The bandits repeatedly attacked Suiyuan's eastern Xinghe and Taolin without success, and concentrated all their efforts on the temple, regarding it as a key area for advancement. Because the authorities recognized the military importance of the temple, they had long been determined to recover it. After active planning by Chairman Fu Zuoyi, they launched a feigned attack on the afternoon of the 22nd. The bandit spies received the news and prepared all night, but seeing no action, they thought that our side had no ability to attack, so they did not care. On the 23rd, our army advanced in two routes, and another surprise force combined infantry, cavalry, and artillery to launch a simultaneous attack on the mountain tops of the temple. The mountain pass in front of the temple had the momentum of one man guarding the pass and ten thousand men unable to pass. Our army bravely pounced on the mountain tops, losing more than a dozen times. Until 5 AM (23rd), our army used two armored vehicles to guide ten heavy military vehicles to charge from the front. Each vehicle had 10 to 20 soldiers, each holding machine guns and shooting forward. At this time, our surprise force's encircling troops also occupied an advantageous position at 7 AM and charged in together. At this point, the bandits could not hold out and fled northeast. After our army charged into the temple, two drivers of the armored vehicles were dead and one was injured. Ten people in the heavy vehicles, six dead and two injured. Six or eight soldiers on each vehicle were also injured or killed. At that time, some of the bandits had not yet escaped and were captured. Our army participating in this campaign included Zhao Chengzhou's cavalry, Sun Changsheng's division, and Sun Lanfeng's less-than-a-brigade number of Fu Zuoyi's troops. After our army arrived at the temple, another infantry unit was sent to pursue. Before leaving, the bandits set fire to some gasoline and military supplies.</p>
<p>Consolidating the Temple Defense</p>
<p>In total, the military supplies accumulated by the bandits in the temple over the years were captured by our side, including three flat rooms of gasoline, tens of thousands of bags of Fengtian-made 65 bullets, 6-700 guns, and countless wireless telegram intelligence documents. Everything in the bandit barracks and offices remained as it was. Some guns and clothes were still hanging on the walls. It can be seen that they did not anticipate our army's surprise attack. When Mr. Fu issued the attack order, he stayed up all night, listening for information from the front at any time. He also received information that the bandits had 5,000 men coming from the west to provide support, so he paid more attention. It was not until he received a telegram on the morning of the 24th that Bai Ling Miao had been recaptured that he felt relieved. (1st)</p>
<h3 id="e75">A Great Fire at Dashatou, Guangzhou; More Than a Hundred Wooden Houses Reduced to Ashes; Hundreds of Refugees Huddling in the Streets <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Communication, Since entering autumn in Guangdong Province, there has been a long drought and no rain, coupled with high winds and dry objects. Citizens are not careful with fire, resulting in repeated fires, with losses of tens of thousands of yuan. This is a problem that deserves attention in society. Moreover, the locations of the fires are mostly slums. Once a disaster occurs, refugees are displaced, and the rubble fields have been unable to recover construction for a long time. The tragic situation is much worse than ordinary fires. Unexpectedly, after the two major fires in Dongguan Xinshengsha and Henan Huaxie Mountain, a fire broke out in Dashatou on the 29th of this month, burning 119 stores and hundreds of homeless poor people. Dashatou is located at the eastern end of the Guangzhou East Bund, separated from the Bund by a strip of water, no different from a small island. It was formerly the third district of Panyu County and was only划入Guangzhou's police area last year, under the jurisdiction of the former Jian Branch. The area is formed by the accumulation of sand, hence the name Dashatou. Nearby ships are like ants, surrounded by water on all sides. The scenery is beautiful. In recent years, due to various economic downturns, it feels bleak. Only a few hundred wooden houses remain along the coast, all of which are workers' residences or fishing households, with low walls and eaves arranged in a scale-like pattern. Last year, the authorities once planned to turn the area into an entertainment area and gambling place, but the matter did not succeed due to the political turmoil. Recently, a certain bank has acquired land there and plans to build a residential area to prosper the area. Dashatou is indeed a good urban area of the future.</p>
<p>The fire started at the Hefahao iron nail factory on Shab North Street. The factory had more than 20 workers. The factory's construction was made of wooden fir planks. At about 12 o'clock on the 29th, due to cooking lunch, the stove fire flew up and burned the plank wall. In a moment, it became unbearable. When the neighbors alerted the police and fire trucks gathered, it was difficult to rescue them due to the narrow streets. Later, the Jinghua fire-fighting ship on the water surface arrived to assist in the rescue. It was not until 2 PM that the fire was extinguished. When the flames were soaring, the residents fled in embarrassment. Several people were burned by the fire, and several people were injured in falls. They were sent to the convenience hospital for treatment by the rescue team. After the investigation, the burnt stores are as follows: On Shab North Street, the shops and households that were burned, from door number 1 to number 54, totaled 54. On Qiaobian Street, from number 1 to number 32, a total of 32 stores were destroyed. On Dongchuanlan, from number 1 to number 13, a total of 13 were destroyed. On Shab South Street, from number 1 to number 20, a total of 20 were destroyed. The above four streets, a total of 119 rooms were burned. In addition, nearby shipyards burned down six or seven ships of various sizes. That night, more than 530 refugees huddled in the streets, which was very pitiful. The Shan Hospital immediately sent staff to transport dry food and cotton clothes to distribute relief. (November 30)</p>

<p>Hankou Communication, Since the assassination of the late Chairman Yang Yongtai of the Hubei Provincial Government, Mr. Lu Zhu, a member and secretary-general of the Central Committee, was immediately appointed by telegram to act as chairman. Therefore, all government affairs proceeded as usual and were not interrupted. As for the selection of a successor as chairman, there was much speculation from the outside world. The Central Committee believed that Hubei was in an important position and needed to select someone carefully. After delaying for more than a month, it was decided to transfer Mr. Huang Shaohong, Chairman of Zhejiang, to take office. It is said that it has been approved at an Executive Yuan meeting one day, but the date of Mr. Huang's arrival in Hubei to take office will have to wait until the handover of the Zhejiang Provincial Government is completed before it can be determined. However, it can be arrived at Hubei by mid-month at the latest. Before Mr. Huang's arrival, the provincial government affairs will still be carried out by Acting Chairman Lu Zhu. Mr. Lu has instructed all responsible personnel to prepare for the handover. However, this is a transfer of the chairman, not a reorganization of the provincial government. The committee members and department heads may not undergo many changes. On the eve of Mr. Huang's announcement of his transfer to Hubei, the Wuhan Garrison Commander was also ordered to change. The former commander, Mr. Chen Jicheng, was promoted to the director of the Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi Border Area, responsible for maintaining stability in the border area. The organization of the common office and the location have not yet been determined. Mr. Chen has telegraphed Chairman Chiang to ask for instructions. The newly appointed commander, Mr. Guo Chan, formerly the chief of staff of the 18th Army, recently arrived in Hubei from Guangdong and is scheduled to take office on the 10th. During the transition period between the old and new commanders, three public security disturbance cases occurred in Wuhan in the past two days: (1) The giant robbery case of the Jukang pawn shop in Houhualou, Hankou. Four bandits, each armed with a handgun, completely robbed the shop at 10 PM on the 30th. By the time the police arrived, the bandits had already fled far away and could not be apprehended. (2) The assassination case in Yifeng Alley, Wuchang. The victims were the aunt and nephew of the Wang family, residents of No. 3. Both were fatally wounded and died. One suspect was arrested at the scene. (3) The kidnapping case of Guo Wenyu, the young owner of Qixin Photo Studio on Jianghan Road, Hankou. Guo was only seven years old. He was kidnapped from the shop on the 29th and a ransom of 5,000 yuan was demanded. One bandit was arrested one day, but Guo had already been killed. Wuhan's public security has been well maintained in recent years, with very few robbery and murder cases. Kidnapping and killing of hostages is even unheard of. During the winter defense period, three major cases occurred in two days, and all of them were in the bustling city, which cannot but attract attention.</p>

<p>Xiamen Communication, The bandits in Zhangzhou, especially the small groups in Haicheng, Fuxi, and Zhangpu, are the most brutal, rampaging through the townships of the three counties and often at sea in Zhangma. Haicheng is indeed a den of musk. There are groups led by Huang Guotai, Hong Datou, Guo Loukong, Zheng Beizai, Huang Adong, Chen Lianqing, Chen Quan, Huang Gansheng, Qiu Lian, Zheng Ba, Zheng Qingzhi, Gan Meihua, and Longxi, led by Jiang Tiansi, and Zhangpu, led by Zhang Baoxiang and Lan Cang, with each group having dozens or more than ten or twenty people. Huang Guotai, who has a certain background, is the leader. Among the groups, Guotai's direct bandit unit, Hong Datouzhong, Guo Loukong, and Zheng Beizai are larger and the most brutal. Zheng was killed by the former defense army's 75th Division in early October, and the remnants were led by Huang Guotai. After the 157th Division took over the defense of southwestern Fujian, it actively suppressed Guotai and other groups. On November 28, the 942nd Regiment of the 471st Brigade of the division killed the bandit leader Hong Datou in Jiaojiao, Haicheng County. The regiment learned that Hong Datou had led his troops to hide in Jiaojiao, Daqiqian, the intersection of Zhangpu and Haicheng. On the night of the 27th, he rushed from the county seat overnight and surrounded him in three routes. Hong led more than 40 bandits to resist in a panic. After fierce fighting until the morning of the 28th, Hong was shot and killed in battle. The remaining bandits fled. Yang Louchang and He Gugui were captured. Hong's body was taken to the county government for public display. Two Mauser pistols were seized. Hong's body was shown to the public. Yang and He were shot dead on the morning of the 29th. Hong Datou once killed Chen Wenpin, the fourth district chief of Zhangpu, and killed the entire family of more than a dozen people of Su Yuqi, the director of the Dongmentou Joint Security. He usually robbed, kidnapped, and killed, doing everything possible, which was hated by the people of Chengpu. In addition, Hong Datou's bandit life was extremely extravagant, with one wife and two concubines, and he also had a lot of bandit property. It is heard that the authorities plan to confiscate the bandit property for public use. Recently, the local newspapers reported that the 157th Division would incorporate Huang Guotai, Hong Datou, Huang Hedong, and other bandits. Mr. Li Yupei, director of the division's political training office, met with reporters on the 30th and formally denied the proposal. Guotai has a certain background and is extremely brutal. His harm to the people is greater than that of the major bandits in southwestern Fujian. On November 16, Huang Adong and Lan Cang attacked the office building of Wudan Village, Xia Palace Society, in the first district of Zhangpu, because they failed to collect more than 5,000 yuan, killing Chief Yang Zhi and as many as 39 villagers, men, women, and children. It was indeed a great catastrophe. (December 2)</p>

<p>Di Jianpei, a first-class soldier of the Second Company of the Sixth Battalion of the Provincial Security Forces stationed in Wuxi, was 31 years old and from Liyang. He was responsible for guarding the Second Company headquarters at Nanchansi Temple under the Nanmen Pagoda Bridge. Several days ago, Di committed a mistake and was ordered by his superior officer to kneel as punishment for two hours. Di felt extremely ashamed and humiliated, and the thought of suicide arose in his mind. Yesterday morning around 6 AM, Di took a rifle, pretending to go to the nearby toilet, but unexpectedly shot himself. With a loud bang, Di fell to the ground, dead on the spot, lying stiff in a pool of blood. The bullet entered his abdomen and exited his shoulder blade. The battalion adjutant, Hu Dun, notified the deceased's cousin, Di Tingheng, to prepare a coffin for burial. It was truly tragic.</p>

<p>The Third District Division of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Corps considers the Shengsi Islands under the jurisdiction of Chongming County to be the most important fishing area in Jiangsu Province. Every winter during the ribbonfish season, patrol ships are dispatched to maintain order and protect fishermen's businesses. However, since the Bảo vệ Đoàn (Defense Corps) rebellion, the area's vitality has been greatly damaged and its strength has not been restored. During this fishing season, comprehensive consideration is necessary to ensure safety. With the fishing season approaching, the Division is making careful plans for protection and actively implementing them. The Division has invited the County Magistrate of Chongming and the fleet commander of the District Division to discuss protection measures. Detailed arrangements have been made for fleet deployment, departure times, command and dispatch, and coordination and support.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Huoqiu Developing West Lake Wasteland <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Anhui provincial authorities have been determined to develop water conservancy projects and reclaim wasteland in recent years, sparing no effort. Significant results have been achieved in irrigation projects. The development of West Lake in Huoqiu is a prime example of this success. West Lake is located in the near suburbs of Huoqiu County and is a famous scenic spot in northern Anhui. The lake covers an area of 430 square li, totaling 7,000 qing, of which 4,000 qing are already cultivated land (including 2,000 qing of government wasteland). The newly dried land and the land still under water each account for over 1,000 qing. In order to develop the lake and turn all the land into arable land, the Anhui provincial government ordered the Huoqiu County government to build the Renjiagou drainage gate and the Xinhe floodgate, as well as culverts at Longwokou and Guanzhoukou. The government also ordered the dredging of the Lihe River, Wangjieliu River, and Xinhe River, and the raising of the lake's dikes. Construction of the culverts and floodgates will be funded by the county government, while the levees will be raised using civilian labor without compensation. It is reported that after a year, the construction of the West Lake culverts and floodgates and the dredging and raising of the dikes have been completed. The reclamation of the land within the lake is being implemented in stages, and sections 2, 3, and 4 are nearing completion. Construction of sections 1, 5, and 6 will officially begin on December 1, with over 9,000 laborers recruited. Officials from the Huoqiu County government will supervise and assist in the project. When completed next year, 1,500 qing of fertile land can be reclaimed. The government wasteland will be leased for 200 yuan per qing, which will bring in 300,000 yuan in one go. If the government operates its own agricultural farms and hires tenants, each qing will produce 1,000 yuan annually, increasing production capacity by 2 million yuan per year, which will greatly benefit agriculture. The development of East Lake in the eastern suburbs of Huoqiu is also being planned.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Letter <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor,</p>
<p>I have just read the news item in your December 1st issue regarding a communication from Fengjing about brothers fighting over their inheritance, and I am deeply shocked. The truth is that I and Rongchu are brothers with a close relationship, and there has never been any discord between us. As for the inheritance, my late father had already divided it fairly while he was still alive and established separate households for us. There has been no conflict whatsoever. Furthermore, I am content with my lot and have no bad habits. My annual income is sufficient to support myself, so how could I be so devoid of conscience as to engage in such heartless acts? The claim that I have squandered my resources and am forcefully seizing my brother's inheritance is clearly a malicious slander. In addition to requesting your newspaper to correct this immediately, I will also take legal action to protect my rights. This matter concerns my personal reputation, so I am writing to you specifically to request a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shen Liuchu of Fengjing, December 2nd</p>

<h3 id="e93">Various Organizations Hold Public Banquet for Hu Shi Last Night; Hu Delivers Public Speech After Dinner; Attendance Is High and No Space Is Left <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Last night at 6:30 PM, the Shanghai International Problems Research Association, the Banking Association, the Money Trade Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Youth Association, the Local Association, the World Chinese Students' Federation, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the International Settlement, the Pacific International Society, the Joint Association of University Faculty, the Public Welfare Promotion Association, and the Shen Bao newspaper jointly held a public banquet at the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association for Hu Shi, the Chinese representative to the Pacific Science Congress. Those in attendance included Lin Kanghou, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Huang Renzhi, Lu Bohong, Weng Zhilong, Ou Yuanhuai, Liu Yuwan, Li Dachao, Zhu Shaoping, Zhang Ganchen, Zhang Shouyong, Liu Zhanen, Dai Baoliu, Cao Yunxiang, and Ma Yinliang, among dozens of others. The atmosphere was convivial, and the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves. After dinner, Hu Shi went to the auditorium to deliver a public speech titled "Thoughts on Returning." The audience was extremely enthusiastic, and latecomers were unable to enter. Liu Zhanen first introduced Hu Shi's speech, saying that the mission to the United States was twofold: one was to attend the Sixth Pacific International Congress, and the other was to represent Peking University, Nankai University, and the Academia Sinica at the Harvard University Tercentenary. The biggest takeaway from the Harvard University Tercentenary was that each representative was given a booklet listing the academic institutions they represented, each with a number corresponding to the institution's founding date. Peking University was listed as number 419, Nankai University as number 454, and the Academia Sinica as number 499. There were only five numbers below that, and he deeply felt that our five-thousand-year-old culture was so backward. In ancient times, we had the establishment of the Taixue (Imperial Academy), and during the Eastern Han Dynasty, there were over 30,000 students at the Taixue. The early establishment and large number of students surpassed those of European schools today. Unfortunately, our ancient schools lacked continuity, and the principals and professors were all government officials and could not be separated from politics, so the academic atmosphere and cultivation of talent could not continue. The success of European universities today is due to the fact that their leaders and talents all come from universities. The European Renaissance, the Reformation, and the research of new sciences were all led by figures who came from universities. The difference between them and us lies in the presence or absence of universities. Only five were listed after us, such as Princeton University, where people like Einstein came from. Students at the California Institute of Technology have even won the Nobel Prize. This is sufficient proof that even if the founding date is late, it is not too late to catch up. As for the Pacific International Congress, it was held in Yosemite, California, which was formerly a Spanish imperial territory. Today, the Spanish Civil War is still ongoing, and the future is bleak. This is sufficient to show that empires that rely solely on military force and lack cultural and industrial foundations cannot last. Facts are the most powerful form of propaganda. Three years ago, at the Pacific Conference, countries were indifferent to the situation in the Far East. Today, countries have economic conflicts with Japan and feel threatened. The peace of the Pacific is no longer guaranteed. Now, countries are either adopting reciprocal agreements, boycotting Japanese imports, or increasing import taxes to cope. At the same time, in military and political terms, the Pacific Rim countries are expanding their military forces. This proves that the facts created by Japan outweigh countless propaganda efforts. American public opinion has undergone a major change. From 1914 to 1931, Japan dominated the Pacific. During the European war, that was of course the case. Although the Washington Conference resulted in restrictions on Japan, its hegemony was still recognized by all countries. However, after the September 18th Incident, Japan abused its hegemony and made it a harmful thing, thereby triggering: (1) the Soviet Union's attention to the East, (2) the increase in military forces in Pacific countries outside of Asia, and (3) China's awakening and the completion of unification. What the future will bring is difficult to predict, but seeking help from others is ultimately an illusion. Constantly creating facts is the real interest and can give people a deeper feeling. Tonight at 8 PM, the Shanghai International Problems Research Association, the Returned Students Association, the Pan-Pacific Society, the Joint Association of University Faculty, and the Pacific International Society will host a banquet for Hu Shi at the International Hotel. At that time, Hu Shi will deliver a speech in English on "The Evolving Pacific."</p>

<h3 id="e97">New Buildings for Shanghai Medical Affairs Undertakings Completed in Succession; Ninth Meeting Held Yesterday <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Medical Affairs Board of Directors held its ninth meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday in the new campus meeting room of the National Shanghai Medical College, located at Shenjia浜 South, Fenglinqiao. Chairman Kong Yongzhi, Minister, and Directors Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Zhengting, Zhao Jinqing, Ma Yinliang, Wen Lanting, Guo Shun, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Jiguang, Lu Chengzhang, Li Tingan, Yan Fuqing, Xu Xinliu (represented by Yan Fuqing), etc., attended. First, they visited the new buildings of the Medical College and Zhongshan Hospital, and then convened the meeting, chaired by Chairman Kong. First, General Director Yan reported that the construction of the Medical College has been completed, and students in the basic departments have been moved in for classes. In addition, a student dormitory has also been completed. The Songde Hall and Liangcai Hall buildings will both be completed by the end of this month, along with the Zhongshan Hospital building. The original site of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office, which was purchased previously, has been rebuilt into a graduate nurses' dormitory, and vocational housing is being built on the vacant land. This is a summary of the construction. Next, the financial report was made. The Board of Directors has hired accountant Chao Jimei as an auditor to review the financial income and expenditure, and the construction accounts of Zhongshan Hospital, and prepare a report. After the directors reviewed it, it was approved. In addition, accountant Chao also designed an accounting system for Zhongshan Hospital, which was resolved to be submitted to the Standing Committee. After the report, the following resolutions were passed: (1) The Shenjia浜 Road in front of Zhongshan Hospital, and the Fenglin Road on the side, should be quickly paved with asphalt roads by the Municipal Government to facilitate traffic. In addition, the main gate of the Medical College is planned to be built across Shenjia浜 Road to enhance its grandeur, and will be dismantled and moved back when the road is opened in the future. When the above two motions were passed, Mayor Wu, attending as a director, approved them on the spot. (2) The purpose of Zhongshan Hospital's construction is to serve society, so although the number of beds is large, they are all for the common people. The first-class wards are insufficient, and it is proposed to build another first-class ward building, which will cost 60,000 yuan. How should the funds be raised? It was resolved to build another first-class ward building, named 中正樓(Zhongzheng Building) to commemorate Chairman Chiang, and the expenses will be borne separately by the directors. Detailed methods will be proposed by Directors Kong Yongzhi, Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Qian Xinzhi, Liu Hongsheng, Lin Kanghou, Ye Zichong, and Yan Fuqing. After the discussion, the meeting adjourned. It was late into the evening.</p>
<h3 id="e98">After Brisk Yarn Sales, Yarn Inventory Is Exhausted; Total Is Less Than 10,000 Bales; Truly an Unprecedented Record in Ten Years; Yarn Prices Rise to a New High After 128 <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>After yarn sales picked up in various regions, yarn inventory has greatly decreased, reaching a low not seen in ten years. Prices have risen to a new high of 256 yuan. However, due to the lack of national cotton harvests and low Indian cotton prices, a new phenomenon of cheap cotton and expensive yarn has emerged. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Active Yarn Sales; Inventory Exhausted</p>
<p>Since August,现紗(spot yarn) sales have been consistently good, continuously rising. Even the Tianjin幫(group), which had been inactive for a long time, has been buying in large quantities, causing Shanghai's yarn inventory to decrease greatly. As of the end of September, it was 34,840 bales. By the end of October, it had dropped to 14,240 bales, of which 1,403 bales were from Japanese factories, and 12,837 bales were from Chinese and British factories, a low not seen in nearly ten years. At the same time, the yarn inventory in the warehouses of the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange had decreased to 5,485 bales by the end of October.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Have Risen to New Highs</p>
<p>In November,现紗(spot yarn) sales continued to be very good. Various yarn factories had already sold a lot of futures in the past two months, so the yarn that they could supply to the market greatly decreased. At the same time, a labor strike occurred in Japanese yarn factories, reducing production by 30% overall. This further reduced the supply to the market, creating a phenomenon where no yarn could be purchased. Last Saturday, sales in Sichuan were very good, causing yarn prices to rise sharply in recent days. In December, each bale had risen to a new high of 256 yuan, unseen since 128.</p>
<p>Strong Cloth Sales Help Yarn Price Increase</p>
<p>As for Shanghai's yarn inventory as of the end of November, it is estimated to have dropped to below 10,000 bales, while the yarn inventory in the warehouses of the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange is only 1,605 bales. The reason for the yarn price increase is entirely due to insufficient production to meet demand, and not due to speculation. As for the cotton weaving factories that use yarn as raw material, their sales are very good due to the good harvests in rural areas across the country and the increased purchasing power of the people. They are already buying spring goods for next year, which is further fueling the yarn price increase.</p>
<p>Creating a New Phenomenon of Cheap Cotton and Expensive Yarn</p>
<p>In the past, cotton did not rise much along with yarn. In recent days, it has risen slightly, mainly because the yarn increase is too great. However, the cotton price increase is still not as high as yarn. The reasons are: (1) Because of the large domestic harvest, it is estimated that there will be a supply of 1.4 million擔(dan), which is calculated to be surplus. (2) Because Indian cotton prices are low, the current Chinese cotton prices are close to Indian cotton prices. If Chinese cotton prices rise further, it will cause Indian cotton imports, so the general public is still bearish on cotton prices. This phenomenon is actually beneficial to the yarn industry. In summary, it is still a reversal of the past five or six years of cheap yarn and expensive cotton.</p>

<p>Dagong News Agency reported that the Jijiang Temple Police Station of the Jiading County Public Security Bureau has detained more than 120 rice boats passing through the Wusong Port from Wuxi, Changshu, Wujiang, Kunshan, and other places from 3:00 PM the day before yesterday to 5:00 PM yesterday, and eight or nine wheat boats. The boats are connected end to end in the six or seven里(li) river ports from Huangdu in the east to Beixin泾 in the south. Because the waterway is very shallow, other boats coming and going are blocked. After the news spread to the Beishi rice market in the city, Fu Qianeng, a member of the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association, Jiang Shizhi, chairman of the Beishi Grain Merchants Association, and Lu Muqin and Shi Zufug, directors of the Changshu Guild Hall, went to the Jijiang Temple area yesterday morning to investigate, and then went to Jiading to meet with County Magistrate Guo and Jin Boqin, chairman of the county chamber of commerce, to inquire about the truth of the detention of transit rice boats.

<p>Henan Province is suffering from an extraordinarily severe drought this year. The provincial government sent Chang Zhizhen, a member of the provincial committee and chairman of the provincial relief association, south to request relief. He recently went to Beijing, and then came to Shanghai yesterday afternoon. Zhang Fang, a member of the provincial committee, also came south from the province to assist in the negotiations. A banquet is scheduled to be held to report on the disaster situation to all sectors in the city. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Banquet Tonight for Leaders from All Sectors</p>
<p>Chang Zhizhen, the representative of Henan Province who came south to request relief, came to Shanghai a few days ago and hosted a banquet for the news media to report on the disaster situation in the province. After briefly contacting leaders of various charitable organizations in the city, he went to Beijing the next day to claim the 300,000 yuan in public bonds promised by the Ministry of Finance, and negotiated with the banking sector in Beijing on the matter of mortgaging cash. He came to Shanghai yesterday afternoon after finishing the matters. At the same time, Zhang Fang, a member of the Henan Provincial Government, also came to Shanghai from the province via Pinghan, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi to assist in the proceedings. After consulting with the Henan Association in Shanghai, it was decided to hold a banquet at the Central Western Restaurant on the 4th to report on the disaster situation to all party, government, and military leaders in the city, as well as leaders of various charitable organizations, and request assistance in disaster relief. After arriving in Shanghai, Zhang went to pay respects to former Executive Duan, and will return to the province with Chang after participating in the public memorial.</p>
<p>Chang Zhizhen Talks About the Recent Situation in Henan</p>
<p>The reporter interviewed Chang yesterday. According to him, Henan Province has made progress in politics and construction since 1920, such as the construction of highways, which have connected the province and neighboring provinces. However, due to financial difficulties, only Xinyang to Huangchuan, Huangchuan to Sanhejian, and Luotong highways have been paved. The rest have a solid roadbed, and the Construction Bureau operates public buses for convenient transportation. As for waterways, they have not been paying attention to them, so there are frequent floods and droughts. The provincial government is also actively working on construction. The province's main products are cotton and tobacco. The farmers have a simple life and can still make ends meet. However, the southwestern border of the province is barren and the people are poor. The province's tax revenue is less than 20 million yuan, and income and expenditure can be balanced, but in case of disasters, assistance from the central government and other regions is required. He is very grateful for the concern shown by all parties during this visit to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Fishery Syndicate Established Early; Participating Banks Paid Up Capital; Bank of China Established a Special Account for Temporary Collection; Meeting Convened on the 6th to Discuss Lending Methods <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Fishery Syndicate jointly established by the Ministry of Industry and the Bank of China has already begun investigation work after the establishment of the preparatory office. In order to expedite the loan disbursement, it is planned to officially establish it on New Year's Day next year. A third preparatory meeting is specifically scheduled to be held on the 6th to discuss and decide on the capital of 1 million, and each bank will begin to pay up. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Expedited Loans and Scheduled Establishment</p>
<p>The Fishery Syndicate Preparatory Office, since the second preparatory meeting, decided to limit the preparation period to three months, and stipulated the preparatory work: (1) Collect 1 million yuan of fishery syndicate funds; (2) Formulate the syndicate's business policy; (3) Draft the syndicate's various rules; (4) Draft the general rules for the organization of various fishery production and sales cooperatives; (5) Investigate the fishery situation and the status of existing fishery cooperatives. The preparatory office has now begun to proceed. It is learned that the Ministry of Industry, in view of the lack of capital for the seasonal fishermen, intends to increase the output of the spring fishing season next year, and therefore plans to shorten the syndicate's preparation work and officially establish it and start lending on January 1 next year.</p>
<p>Preparatory Meeting Convened to Decide</p>
<p>Qian Xinzhi, director of the preparatory office, has already hired Qu Junwei, director of the Shanghai Fishery Guidance Office, and Hua Wenyu, director of the lending department of the Xinhua Bank, as design committee members for various design matters, and hired Cao Erwei and other four people as investigators to be responsible for the investigation work. Now, in order to expedite the preparation work and decide on the early establishment date, it is planned to convene a third preparatory meeting on the 6th to discuss the fishery lending methods and various rules. Wu Dingchang, Minister of Industry, has decided to send Yu Zhenyong, Director of the Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Department, to Shanghai to attend and guide the meeting.</p>
<p>Capital of One Million Deposited in Bank of China</p>
<p>The syndicate's capital is 1 million yuan, with 200,000 yuan of fixed capital, which will be paid by the Ministry of Industry. The circulating capital is 800,000 yuan, divided into 40 shares, with each share being 20,000 yuan. The Bank of China has 120,000 yuan, the Bank of Communications has 100,000 yuan, and the Shanghai Bank, the Jin Cheng Bank, the Continental Bank, the Salt Industry Bank, the Zhongnan Bank, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Zhonghui Bank, the Xinhua Bank, and the Four Banks Savings Association each have 60,000 yuan, and the Siming Bank has 40,000 yuan, totaling 800,000 yuan. Before the syndicate is officially established, the Bank of China will open a special account to manage the funds. Each bank has prepared to pay up, and once the official establishment date is determined, the full amount can be paid.</p>
<p>Loans to Begin in the Spring Fishing Season</p>
<p>According to reporters from the Xin Xin News Agency who inquired with banks participating in the syndicate, the official start of lending by the Fishery Syndicate will be before the spring fishing season next year. At that time, the syndicate will be officially established, and various lending methods and investigation work will be ready. As for the lending for the winter fishing season this year, the Zhonghui Bank, the Xinhua Bank, and the Four Banks Savings Association have advanced 120,000 yuan to lend to Shanghai fish market wholesalers and the Yin County Fishery Cooperative, and the applications for loans have been very enthusiastic. Most of them have already been disbursed, and only a few are still under review, but they will also be disbursed soon. The future situation of the loans will be considered, and it may be deducted from the total amount of 1 million yuan for balance.</p>

The Municipal Social Bureau has handled the matter repeatedly, but it has not been resolved, resulting in the unemployment of more than 100 workers. The Ningbo and Guangdong native place associations in Shanghai, witnessing the stalemate, deeply felt that failing to resolve the issue would affect social security and the livelihoods of workers. Therefore, they initiated a meeting scheduled for the 2nd of this month at the Ningbo Native Place Association, convening responsible representatives from both sides. Representatives from the Trade Union included Wang Wenhao, Han Aqin, Zhu Wenfu, and Qin Ziquan. Representatives from Lianyi Hall included Chen Zuo Hou, Zhao Zelin, Li Shiying, and Gan Yingnan.

After persuasion, both parties accepted the principle and scheduled another meeting for 4:00 PM on the 4th of this month by the two native place associations.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Reporter from the Continental News Interviews Fessenden Regarding the Municipal Council's Cost Reduction Plan; Funds from the Sale of the Electric Department Nearly Exhausted; Tax Office and Education Office Revisions Will Have Impact <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Continental News reports: A reporter from the Continental News interviewed Fessenden, Director-General of the Municipal Council, yesterday (1st), asking whether the Municipal Council would be willing to reconsider the proposals for salary reductions for employees put forward by the Special Economy Committee. Mr. Fessenden replied that the Municipal Council is always willing to study any reasonable suggestions put forward by employees regarding this matter. However, the Municipal Council believes that the proposals put forward by the Special Committee are the only feasible way for the Council to cope with the huge annual deficit. The reporter further inquired about criticisms that the proposals of the Commodity Committee were unfair, especially with regard to lower-level employees, and what criticisms he had of this. Mr. Fessenden replied that this was just an opinion. Mr. Fessenden also stated that the proposal put forward by the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, advocating the complete elimination of subsidies for foreign employees' exchange losses, was too harsh. If this were implemented, it would be equivalent to a 16.4% salary reduction for foreign employees, which would be too large. In the past six or seven years, in order to balance the budget, the Municipal Council has had to draw on reserves, which came from the sale of the Electric Department. The funds have been drawn on year after year, and are almost exhausted. The financial difficulties of the Municipal Council in the future can be imagined from this. The general public's comments on the Municipal Council's cost reduction plan are actually due to the current economic downturn in Shanghai, which has led to this situation. While this is true, it does not fully capture the truth. The main reason why the Municipal Council wants to implement large salary cuts and other cost reduction plans is that in the past seven years, the Municipal Council's income has often been insufficient to cover its expenditures. Since 1927, after the patrolman's tax was reduced from 16% to 14%, the Municipal Council has felt that it is impossible to increase the tax rate. However, judging from the current financial situation of the Municipal Council, even if it is increased, it will still not be able to cover the deficit. The only cost reduction measures that the Municipal Council can implement are to reduce employee salaries and other compensation. The public and Municipal Council employees should consider the cost reduction plan, which includes the proposals submitted by the Special Committee, in its entirety, and should not comment on it based on individual opinions. Chinese and foreign employees of the Municipal Council are still vociferously expressing their opposition to the salary reduction plan. Yesterday afternoon, foreign employees of the Tax Office and foreign employees of the Education Office held separate meetings to listen to the explanation of the Special Committee's report. The consensus of the meeting was that the report was very vague. The employees of the Tax Office have already handed this matter over to the Employees' Union of that office for handling. There are many senior personnel in it, so if there are any revisions, the words issued by that group will be very powerful.</p>

<h3 id="e117">False Report of Death to Defraud Life Insurance Payout; Li Bingjing Has Two Scars on His Head; Removing His Hair-Pressing Cap Confirms He is the Person <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Li Bingchang, also known as Li Benchu, is currently thirty-two years old and opened the Liyuan Money Shop in Chaoyang County, Guangdong. On May 19th of the 21st year of the Republic of China, he took out a life insurance policy with the Hong Kong branch of the American Foreign Insurance Company for HK$50,000. He stated that if Li were to die in the future, the payout should be given to his wife, Li Liang Zhiying (30 years old, from Shantou) to receive. At that time, the company had a doctor verify Li Bingchang's physique, but Li had two characteristic scars on his head, one on his neck and one on his forehead. These were noted on the document. Li then paid the first</p>
<p>premium of four hundred twenty-three yuan and forty-seven cents. On February 4th of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the Hong Kong Foreign Insurance branch suddenly received a letter from Li Bingchang's wife, Li Liang Zhiyang, stating that her husband, Li Bingchang, had taken the Hai Ning Steamer from Shantou to Hong Kong on January 23rd of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, and suddenly committed suicide by jumping into the sea. His luggage and three suicide notes had been forwarded by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. to confirm this. Therefore, she requested that the company compensate for the insured life insurance fee of</p>
<p>HK$50,000, etc. After receiving the letter, the Hong Kong Foreign Insurance branch forwarded it to the Foreign Insurance head office at No. 17 Bund, Shanghai for investigation. However, according to the company's articles of association, if the premium of a life insurance policyholder is paid for one year and they commit suicide, the insurance company should be liable for compensation. Therefore, the head office sent personnel to investigate whether Li Bingchang had died. On November 16th of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the head office investigated with Hua Ge, the owner of the Hai Ning Steamer, and found that there was no passenger on the Hai Ning Steamer who committed suicide by jumping into the sea and issued a certificate. Therefore, the Foreign Insurance Company had</p>
<p>doubts about Li Bingchang's death. During this time, Li Liang Zhiying repeatedly sent letters to the company urging them to pay the compensation. She also hired lawyer Xu Zhangguo in Guangzhou to send letters to the company, saying that if it was deliberately delayed, they would resolve it legally. The company did not pursue the matter as Li's death could not be proven, and according to the rules, the compensation would have to be paid after seven years. However, they secretly continued the investigation until recently, when they learned that Li Bingchang was indeed still alive. The previous death news was fabricated, thereby</p>
<p>attempting to defraud the compensation. They telegraphed Shantou, instructing Li Liang Zhiying to come to Shanghai for a face-to-face discussion. Li Liang Zhiying, along with her fellow villager Zhang Zhengde (56 years old), came to Shanghai together on the 26th of last month, staying in rooms 207 and 215 of the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road. All accommodation expenses were borne by the company. Meanwhile, Zhou Ruofu, a staff member dispatched by the Foreign Insurance Company, secretly investigated their actions. Li Liang Zhiying and Zhang Zhengde had negotiated at the head office on the 27th and 28th of last month. On the 30th, Zhou Ruofu, dispatched by the Foreign Insurance Company, suddenly saw Li Liang Zhiying going to 17</p>
<p>Lingnan Hostel, Wuchang Road. After Zhou investigated, it was found that Lin Yuan had checked into room 17. Lin was wearing a hair-pressing cap and looked suspicious. Fearing that it was Li Bingchang in disguise, he immediately reported to the General Police Station, which dispatched detective Haite to the Lingnan Hostel to arrest Lin Yuan. At first, he denied it, but after removing the hair-pressing cap and revealing two scars on his neck and forehead, it was confirmed that Lin Yuan was indeed Li Bingchang in disguise. He then went to the New Asia Hotel and continued to arrest Li Liang Zhiyang and Zhang Zhengde.</p>
<p>They were taken into custody separately.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunji prosecuted them for attempted fraud under Articles 339, Section 1 and 3 of the Criminal Code, and stated the above circumstances, saying that the defendant Li Bingchang admitted in the police station that he had designed the fraud due to business failure, and stated that when he took the Hai Ning Steamer, he bought a first-class ticket in a Western suit, and then changed into Chinese clothing and disembarked among the third-class passengers. After Judge Pan Zhenyang briefly interrogated the three defendants, he ordered them to be detained separately and rescheduled the trial for Friday of this week.</p>

<p>Lawyer Fei Guoxi was involved in a lawsuit in court because Wu Genjue and his wife were at odds. Wu discovered that the divorce document submitted by his wife was forged by lawyer Fei, and he revealed this inside story in court. Fei, out of anger, punched Wu in the house at No. 5, Lane 300, Xinzha Grand Road, injuring him. Wu reported this to the police station in charge, and Detective Li Shizhong investigated and confirmed the facts. He then filed a complaint against Fei Guoxi in the First Special District District Court for assault. The court has issued a summons to the defendant, ordering him to appear in court this morning to be interrogated.</p>

<p>The Continental News reports that Dr. Andersson, who is believed to have discovered "Peking Man", quietly arrived in Shanghai on a Swedish ship a few days ago. The doctor is knowledgeable and amiable. After leaving China for nine years, he has now returned and will use Shanghai as his office, staying in the Far East for a year before returning to his hometown of Stockholm, Sweden. In accordance with the contract signed with the Geological Society of China, the doctor will discuss with his Chinese colleagues in Shanghai the publication of various papers on the discovery of antiquities in China. The doctor is currently the director of the Swedish Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities. Although he enjoys great fame, he is unwilling to enjoy his leisure in his hometown, so he has returned to China to continue his work to complete his many unfinished plans. According to reports, the doctor came to China in 1911 and served as a geological advisor to the Chinese government. In the years that followed, he engaged in the study of Chinese antiquities and related issues. His footsteps have taken him from the far north to Qinghai, and he is a frequent visitor to Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu. His greatest contribution to the scientific community was the discovery of "Peking Man" in Xishan, a suburb of Beijing. The doctor has also explored the North and South Poles but still never forgets these two places.</p>

<p>Mr. Wang Xiaotang, a native of Zhenhai, Zhejiang, lived in Shanghai for more than 40 years and was a capable and practical person who did not engage in hypocrisy. In the late Qing Dynasty, seeing that education in our country was in its infancy and undergoing reforms, and that the tools should change with the trend, he believed that if a worker wants to do a good job, he must first sharpen his tools, and that promoting cultural supplies was an urgent task. He contacted Mr. Lin Kanghou, the late Mr. Shi Liangcai, and raised funds to establish the Heji Educational Supplies Company, with Mr. Wang as the manager. He worked hard and diligently, and the business flourished, becoming well-known far and wide. Since its establishment 30 years ago, it has been the leader in the stationery industry. All those in the stationery industry in Shanghai have come from his company. He was 61 years old and still had a vibrant spirit. He wore simple clothing and was content. After the Autumn Festival, he suffered from liver disease and sought treatment from Chinese and Western doctors, but was unable to recover. He passed away at 6:00 AM on November 28th. The funeral will be held at 3:00 PM on December 3rd (today) at the China Funeral Home. It is expected that there will be a large number of people going to the Sege Road to pay their respects and look at his remains.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Amid the US Strike Wave; Canadian and Japanese Ships Arrive in Shanghai; Mail to be Sent via Siberia; Japan Plans to Add More Mail Ships <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that all American ships along the Pacific coast, except for the McKinley, have completely suspended service as a result of the US shipping strike. Canadian and Japanese mail ships are benefiting greatly from this. Yesterday (1st), the Japanese Empress of the Changxing Company arrived in Shanghai, carrying a total of 900 passengers. Another Japanese ship also arrived carrying more than 200 passengers. Both ships are carrying a large amount of US mail, some of which has been delayed for a long time. The Nikkai Maru has 717 passengers going to various southern ports. The remaining hundred or so passengers are mostly well-known foreigners traveling in Shanghai, several of whom had been stranded in Honolulu for a long time. It is reported that when the ship departed from Honolulu to the Orient, it carried a total of 908 passengers. According to reports, the Japan Mail Steamship Company has made it very convenient for passengers stranded in Honolulu in the past few weeks. In accordance with US government regulations, it paid a fine of US$200 per passenger, as all foreign ships carrying passengers from one US port to another must pay this amount. However, this fee is of course borne by the passengers. Since the Nikkai Maru and the Canadian Empress departed from Hawaii and went to Canadian ports, there is no such issue. The company's staff stated yesterday that all ship tickets have been booked. Even American diplomats and military personnel going to their posts in the East have had to switch to non-American ships. The newly appointed American District Attorney for this port, Mr. Shearer, is also coming to Shanghai on a Japanese ship and is expected to arrive on the 13th of this month. It is reported that if the strike continues unabated, the Japan Mail Steamship Company plans to add more mail ships between the United States and the East to increase capacity. As for mail, the post office has agreed that if necessary, it will be shipped via Siberia, but it must be clearly marked on the envelope. The McKinley President of the Changxing Company is scheduled to set sail from Shanghai this morning, taking the route to Seattle via Japan, carrying many passengers. This is the last Pacific coast passenger and mail ship, but it is expected that it will also join the strike upon arrival in Seattle. American shipping personnel in this port now have almost nothing to do, and as the strike continues with labor and management deadlocked, it seems unlikely to be resolved anytime soon.</p>

<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau originally set the deadline for opium smokers in this city to renew their third-term opium prohibition licenses at the end of November. However, it has been found that a small number of opium smokers have not yet renewed their licenses by the deadline. Fearing that some may have gone to other ports and not been able to return in time, the Opium Prohibition Association has been specially requested to extend the deadline by one month, to the end of December of this year. After this extension, those who fail to renew their licenses will be dealt with in accordance with the law. In addition to the public announcement, a notice has been issued to all relevant parties.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Yang Wendao and Ye Haisheng Appeal Case: Second Branch of the High Court Holds All-Day Trial. Yang States Judicial Independence Cannot Yield to Any Party's Intentions. Ye Says He Is Like a Lamb Subdued by a Pack of Tigers. Hong Wenwei Steps Forward to Testify, Speaking Out for Yang Wendao's Injustice. Appellants' Lawyers Subsequently List All the Suspicious Points in the Case. —Debate Adjourned Yesterday; Verdict Set for the Ninth— <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Cantonese men Yang Wendao and Ye Haisheng (nicknamed Xiao Guangdong) were accused of premeditated murder in the case of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo, who was shot and killed on Dith Avenue in Hongkou last winter. The police investigated and determined them to be the perpetrators. The First Special District Court filed charges against them. At the conclusion of the initial trial, Yang and Ye were both sentenced to death. However, Yang and Ye were not satisfied and each filed an appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court through their defense lawyers. The hearing was originally scheduled for the 19th of last month, but was postponed because Yang Wendao became ill in prison and was transferred to a hospital for treatment, unable to appear in court. Thus, it was postponed until</p>
<p>Yesterday Morning at 9 AM.</p>
<p>The Criminal Court President Yu Hua of the Second Branch of the High Court, along with Judges Zhou and Nie, specially convened a collegiate bench, ordering Yang and Ye to be brought forward and summoning witnesses for questioning. Security was tight inside and outside the courtroom. Prosecutor Lin Wopeng also attended to perform his duties. The appellants' attorneys, Zhang Zhirang, Guo Qiming, etc., and the police attorney Ru Baoyi, all appeared in court. After Judge Yu questioned Yang and Ye about their ages and origins, he immediately ordered them to state their reasons for appeal. First, Yang Wendao detailed the reasons for his appeal and the process by which he was framed by Yang Jianzhong, stating that he knew nothing about the case of the murdered Japanese sailor and, having</p>
<p>No Grudge</p>
<p>Against the Japanese sailor, why would he kill this unrelated person? Everyone has a patriotic heart, but killing a Japanese soldier would be of no benefit. Someone named Yang Guimei came to tell me that the police were going to arrest me. I did not heed her words because I had never broken the law. Yang then left in a hurry. Later, Luo Wende came to inform me that Yang Jianzhong had already reported it to the police, so the police were going to arrest me. I still did not listen and on the 16th, I looked for Yang Jianzhong at the Hubei Small Native Place Association and met Yang Chujie. At that time, Yang Guimei was also at the entrance of the association. I then slapped her cheek, blaming her for</p>
<p>Not Speaking Recklessly,</p>
<p>Acknowledging that she had been fooled by Yang Jianzhong. After that, someone followed me all day. As a result, two plainclothes Japanese men took me and Chen Yongsheng into a car and drove us to the police station. The Western inspector held a book in his hand. I immediately admitted that the book was used to hide guns in the past, but it had not been used for a long time. If I were involved in the case, why wouldn't I have fled and instead kept the evidence? The next day, I was taken to court for interrogation. I still admitted that the book was used to hide guns, but seeing that the gun placed in the book's hole did not match, I was very surprised. From then on, I denied that the book was my original book. This book's</p>
<p>Method of Cutting a Hole</p>
<p>Was taught by Yang Jianzhong. In February of this year, Yang came to my house. My child was holding the book and playing with it. I went upstairs because of something. When I came downstairs, Yang Jianzhong had left and the book my child was holding was also gone. From this, it can be seen that Yang Jianzhong must have planted the evidence to frame me. In short, Yang and his cohort were acting according to a deliberate plan. Thus, at the preliminary hearing, Investigator Zhang was brought to testify and he testified that he saw white paper shaped like a handgun at Zheng Huimin's house, and the letters "PB" were written on the paper. In addition to creating this book, they also forged a letter, stamped with the</p>
<p>"Benevolence Association"</p>
<p>Seal and my personal seal. All the items seized from my house were presented at the preliminary hearing, but this letter was not presented. In fact, this letter and the book are both related. I request the court to order the police to also present the letter for research. Now I have appealed to your court because I harbor an unjust grievance. If the book really belonged to me, then there would be no fingerprints on the book. Now, the preliminary hearing sentenced me to death based solely on this one book. Although I am not familiar with the law, I believe the law would never be so simple. The preliminary hearing witness accused me of gambling and etc. with Koreans at the Benevolence Association, but the association's second landlord and tea boy have both testified that</p>
<p>This Never Happened.</p>
<p>Regarding what was involved, only Ye Haisheng confessed that I wanted to expand the Hongkou sphere of influence, so I had the Japanese killed. If I really had the Japanese killed, I could have discarded the murder weapon, so why not discard the book used to hide the gun? Ye also confessed that I gave him the gun on the way, so why didn't I give him the book as well? If I did indeed give the gun to Ye, then please ask if there are any of my fingerprints on the gun. What needs to be emphasized even more is that judicial independence cannot follow any party's intentions and</p>
<p>Destroy the Law.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am not afraid to die, but the law must be strictly maintained. Later, Yang Jianzhong surrendered himself to the police station and testified in court, accusing me of falsely accusing him, but Yang Guimei has not been brought to court to this day, which is enough to show the conspiracy of those people, etc. Ye Haisheng wept and complained that he was completely coerced into confessing. At that time, I was like a lamb, and they were like a pack of tigers, so how could I not submit? Therefore, they wanted me to say whatever they wanted, and I said whatever they wanted. The testimonies of witnesses such as Zeng Yuan and Zhang Caiyuan were</p>
<p>Particularly False.</p>
<p>Although witness Zhang Chen came to court to testify that Zheng Huimin and others were acting according to a deliberate plan, I still repeatedly confessed in this environment, otherwise, I would be taken back to the police station and it would be unbearable. Although the presiding judge at the time questioned me about the reasons for the inconsistencies in my previous and subsequent confessions, I ultimately did not dare to speak frankly. If I had killed the Japanese sailor, why didn't I flee, but instead celebrated my mother's birthday on the day of the incident? Zhang Caiyuan has known me for three or four years, and the clothes he testified I was wearing at the time did not match. Zheng Huimin, seeing that the evidence was insufficient, suggested to the police that the Qingdao dance halls were opened by Ye Haisheng with funds provided by Yang.</p>
<p>Investigate in Qingdao</p>
<p>To be sure to obtain detailed evidence. The police listened to him. Sure enough, they went to Qingdao to investigate, and only obtained a set of my western clothes. In short, I was truly wronged. The presiding judge is as clear as the sky. He can investigate the Moon Palace and other four dance halls, and he will be able to understand the truth about my being framed, etc. The court then questioned Yang about the book "Everyday Physics," which was used to hide the gun. According to his confession, when the police searched my house, I had already been detained at the police station, so how it was found, I really do not know. My book was indeed lost on the day Yang Jianzhong came to visit. I really can't be sure if this book is genuine, because this book and my book are</p>
<p>Slightly Similar in Form.</p>
<p>Therefore, when I was first taken to court, because the place where I stood was far from the case, I did not examine it in detail, and I admitted that this book belonged to me. Later, after careful examination, I realized that it was not mine. The court then questioned Yang about various points in Ye's confession involving Yang. According to Ye Haisheng's confession, Zeng Yuan said that I pawned the handgun to him twice, and then used the gun to kill the Japanese sailor. It turns out that the gun has been in my hands three times, but there are no traces of my fingerprints on the gun. As for the</p>
<p>Live Demonstration</p>
<p>Of the movements at the time, it was just following the pattern mechanically, and Chinese, Western, and Japanese detectives were all around me at the time, so I had to obey their orders in everything, etc. Yang Wendao's lawyer then submitted a bundle of Yang's written account of the whole case while in prison, for review. Lawyer Zhang Zhirang then requested that the forensic institute be asked to re-examine how long the cut marks on the book had been made, and whether the rust marks on the gun and the book matched. Judge Yu believed that there was no need to re-examine, and then announced that the case would be postponed until 2 PM in the afternoon for further trial.</p>
<p>Debate Concludes in the Afternoon</p>
<p>At 2 PM, Judge Yu convened a collegiate bench again to continue the interrogation. The court first asked Yang whether the letter that he requested the police to submit, which had been forged with his name, was related to the case. Yang replied that it was extremely relevant, and his lawyer then stood up to explain the relationship of the letter, saying that the letter was signed by Yang and addressed to Chief Zhu of the Northeast Volunteer Army, stating that the Benevolence Association could form four brigades to participate, and that its intention was to prove that Yang did have an organization to disrupt public order, and that the letter was forged, etc. Police Lawyer Ru then stated that the letter was sent anonymously to the police station after Yang was arrested, and that it was similar to</p>
<p>Anonymous Letters</p>
<p>In nature. After the police compared the handwriting, they confirmed that it was not written by Yang, so they ignored it. Now that it has been mentioned and considered to be beneficial to Yang Wendao, it should be examined. He then presented a photo of the letter to the court. After Yang read it, he said that it was indeed the correct letter. Yang's lawyer, Guo Qiming, then requested that witness Li Yao be summoned to court, because Li was one of the eyewitnesses at the time. According to his statement, he saw Ye Haisheng and Jack, but not Yang Wendao, and the time did not match either. Ru lawyer then stated that regarding Li Yao, the police considered</p>
<p>Unimportant.</p>
<p>Therefore, he was not listed as a witness in the original trial. Although his statement was submitted, Li did not sign the statement, so there was no need to summon him, etc. Judge Yu ruled that Lawyer Guo's request was rejected. He then requested that the book used to hide the gun be issued for review. In addition to the letters "PB" printed on the bottom of the book, were there also "PB" letters printed on the top? When it was issued for review, the top also had these two letters printed on it. Judge Yu, considering that the investigation was complete, ordered the debate to begin. Police Lawyer Ru</p>
<p>Began the Debate First,</p>
<p>Stating that (1) regarding the handgun and bullets, from both factual and academic perspectives, it is sufficient to prove that they were indeed the murder weapon. The appellants' doubts and attacks on the gun and bullets are all deliberate and unreasonable exaggerations. (2) The rust marks on the gun and the rust marks on the book have 41 points in common, and the book was found in Yang's house. At first, Yang thought the gun had not been found, so he admitted that it belonged to him. He claimed that it was not the original book, and that Yang Jianzhong had planted it to frame him. (3) As for Ye Haisheng's claim that his confession was obtained through torture, he never mentioned it during the initial and repeated trials. It was only at the end that he claimed to have been tortured, which makes it</p>
<p>Difficult to Accept.</p>
<p>(4) The appellants claim that this case was intentionally framed by Hui Yuan, Zhang Caiyuan, Zheng Huimin, etc. in order to obtain the reward money, but the original trial's verdict was not based on their confessions, but on direct evidence, so their claims are groundless. (5) As for the fact that there were no fingerprints on the handgun, it is very common, because the gun has uneven textures and is oiled, making it difficult to leave fingerprints. This point was proven by experts during the original trial. (6) It is possible that no bloodstains were left on the bullet because the bullet had sufficient speed and force, and the bullet was made of steel and was extremely smooth, so it was</p>
<p>Possible to Leave No Bloodstains,</p>
<p>And so on. When Lawyer Ru debated to this point, the defendant's defense counsel suddenly sent a slip of paper to the court, stating that today there is a man named Hong Wenwei who is listening to the trial in the gallery, and because he is indignant at Yang Wendao's being wronged, he is willing to come to court to testify and is willing to guarantee with his life. He should be summoned to court. Judge Yu then announced the suspension of the debate and summoned Hong to court. Hong confessed that he was from Zhongshan, Guangdong, 41 years old, residing at 28 Dekang Lane, Dongqiujiang Road, and had been unemployed for more than a year. Now that he is listening to the trial in the gallery, he knows that Yang has been wronged, so he is speaking out for injustice, and is willing to</p>
<h3 id="e131">Lawyer Ye Fokang Accused of Embezzlement; Trial Opened Yesterday. Plaintiff Wang Hanqing Has Not Been Summoned. Judge Questions Ye Why He Was Extorted by Wang. <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Ye Fokang, the former judge of the Shanghai District Court and now practicing lawyer, was accused by Wang Hanqing, who used to be a detective in Hankou, of embezzling 18,000 yuan in the 20th year of the Republic of China due to a theft case in the Public Concession for which he hired Ye as his lawyer. The Ministry of Judicial Administration ordered the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor to release Ye Fokang on 20,000 yuan cash bail and file a public prosecution. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Lu Hongyi opened the trial. Ye hired Lawyer Yu Chengxiu to defend him. According to the defendant Ye Fokang, he is 32 years old, from Wujiang, residing at 454 Nanjing Road, and has been</p>
<p>Working as a Lawyer</p>
<p>For eight years. He used to live in Zhabei and moved to the concession after the January 28th Incident. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, Wang Hanqing, Wang Zhangshi, Wang Fuxian, Wang Cunshi, and others were detained by the First Special Court for a theft case. Wang Zhangshi wrote to me from the detention center to hire me, but we never knew each other, and no one introduced us. It was agreed that the public fee was 4,000 yuan, and Lawyer Ge Fengyuan would assist. The money was paid by Wang Zhangshi in one visit, 2,000 in cash and 2,000 in a passbook. In May of the 20th year, the verdict was announced, declaring them innocent. Wang Zhangshi came out first. After Wang Hanqing came out, he went to the police station to collect his belongings. Because he needed a witness, I accompanied Wang Zhangshi to collect them. At that time, he hired lawyers Fan Gang and others, and the public fee was</p>
<p>Thanked at 3,000 Yuan.</p>
<p>Later, he asked me to reduce it to 1,500 yuan. There was no such payment. All the testimonies of Li Sunshi, saying that I had a 6,000 yuan deposit book and that I forced him to hand over the money, etc., are false. There is no such person as Li Sunshi, and Wang Zhangshi has never lived in my house. The judge asked, "Have you reconciled with Wang Hanqing now?" I replied, "This is a rumor in the newspaper." The judge said, "Then if you have not reconciled, why can't Wang Hanqing be summoned now, and why did he entrust Lawyer Gu Jirong to submit a withdrawal statement, the content of which completely admits to false accusations? This is very unfavorable to him, and he will bear criminal responsibility in the future. How could he accuse you first and then admit to false accusations later?" I replied, "He is</p>
<p>Fleeing out of Fear of Punishment,</p>
<p>Therefore, he confessed." The judge asked, "In the 22nd year of the Republic of China, Wang also sued you once, and it was later withdrawn. I replied, "This was to settle the matter peacefully, so I gave him 5,000 yuan. It was handled by Gu Ao, Cha Renwei, Cai Ding, and Shen Zengkuan, agents of Wang Hanqing." The judge asked, "According to you, you only took 4,000 yuan in public fees, why would you return 5,000 yuan?" I replied, "I was afraid of being entangled in litigation. It was like encountering a rogue when buying peace. There was really no way. Even the prosecutor of your court, Du Jiasheng, was sentenced to four years in the first instance and declared innocent in the second instance." The judge asked, "You are a lawyer, don't you understand the law? He dares to extort you, and why did you pay him another 500 yuan last year?" I replied,</p>
<p>"He Sent a Letter Threatening Me.</p>
<p>I went to my lawyer, Gu, and said, 'Let's do some charity and send him 500 yuan and ask him to sign a compromise agreement.'" At this point, the defense lawyer said, "After Wang Hanxiang filed a private prosecution, he has already withdrawn it, so he cannot sue again. Therefore, the prosecutor's prosecution should be noted by the presiding judge. Article 231 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that the prosecutor can still prosecute if the judgment is not accepted. If there are legal opinions, please submit a statement for consideration." At this point, witness Lawyer Fan Gang was questioned, saying that Wang Hanqing and others' theft case was defended by him and Fan Qisheng, Huang Qiying, and others. The agreed public fee was 3,000 yuan, which was later reduced to 1,500 yuan by Ye Fokang. There was indeed a</p>
<p>Deposit Book in the Police Station,</p>
<p>Totaling 3,000 yuan, which was collected by Ye Fokang on his behalf. At this point, female lawyer Cai Ding, 28 years old, from Changzhou, was questioned. She had no relationship with Ye Fokang. In May of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, Gu, Cha Renwei, and Shen Zengkuan acted as agents for Wang Hanqing to sue Ye Fokang for defrauding him of 18,000 yuan. Later, it was settled for 5,000 yuan. As for last year's 500 yuan, I don't know. At this point, Lawyer Gu said that he joined the Lawyers Association in November of the 21st year. Regarding the 5,000 yuan settlement, it was similar to what Cai Ding said, but he said that last year Wang also asked Lawyer Zhu Honglie to write a letter to Ye Fokang. At that time, I also advised him, and Ye handed Wang 500 yuan on the spot. Lawyer Zhu took 40 yuan, and I didn't want a penny. After Zhu left, he gave Wang another 800 yuan, totaling 1,300 yuan, totaling 6,300 yuan, etc. After Cha Renwei was called as a witness, Gu Jirong was called as a witness, saying that he wrote the withdrawal statement and Wang Hanqing had already returned. At this point, the judge ordered the trial to be adjourned.</p>
<p>Step Forward to Testify. The judge then ordered him to sign a statement and continued to state that since I am a member of the Hongshun Society, I am also a member of the Benevolence and Justice Societies. On November 5th, I was in the Justice Society and did not see Yang and others draw lots. On November 9th, at 1 PM, I went to the Benevolence Society. Soon, Yang also arrived at the meeting. At 11:30 PM, when I left the Benevolence Society, Yang was still at the meeting. In the original trial, I sent a letter to the presiding judge, volunteering to testify, but I was never summoned. If there are any false statements, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment, etc. Judge Yu then ordered him to leave, instructing them to</p>
<p>Continue the Debate. Lawyer Ru then added a little to the debate, and finally stated that the detailed circumstances of the case have all been described in the reply brief, please review it. As for the person who came to court to testify today, since he is a member of the Benevolence and Justice Societies, he is naturally indignant at the chairman's crime, so what he said, I am afraid that all members of the two societies would want to say the same, and it is not credible and should be rejected the appeal and uphold the original verdict. Next, Yang Wendao's two defense lawyers defended Yang one after another, stating that when Qi Haisheng had not been escorted from Qingdao to Shanghai, Yang Jianzhong, Yang Guimei, etc. told Yang Wendao that the police were going to arrest him. Yang Wendao himself</p>
<p>Had Never Committed a Crime,</p>
<p>So he dismissed it with a smile. The reason why those people released this air at that time was to scare Yang Wendao into fleeing, so that they could start reporting to the police and search Yang's house. If Yang was arrested later, if Yang confessed, then they would accuse him of not having committed a crime, why did he flee first, and the reward money could also be obtained. At first, they did not expect Yang to not flee, which forced them to ride a tiger and had to make the best of the situation and go their own way. Yang Wendao thought that he had never committed a crime, and his family had a book with a hole to hide guns, so at the police station and</p>
<p>During the Initial Interrogation, He Admitted That the Book Belonged to Him. When He Saw That Taking the Gun and Putting It in the Hole in the Book Did Not Fit, He Felt That It Was Not Appropriate. Then He Examined It Carefully and Realized That the Name Was the Same But the Form Was Similar, But the Quality Was Completely Different. At This Point, He Denied That It Was His Original Book. As for Ye Haisheng, He Was Arrested and Escorted From Qingdao to Shanghai. After Yang Wendao Was Detained, He Confessed That Yang Was the Mastermind. Every Time Ye Was Escorted to the Scene of the Incident for a Performance, It Was Not Out of Motivation, Let Alone Improvised, But Just Acted Out a Puppet Show. How Can He Accept Being Convicted in This Way? Therefore, He Appealed and Should</p>
<p>Be Declared Innocent, etc. Next, Zhang Zhiyi and other lawyers, who were selected by the court to defend Ye Haisheng, stated that this case was purely initiated by Zheng Huimin, Zeng Yuan, Zhang Caiyuan, etc. in order to obtain the huge reward money offered by the Japanese side and the police. The circumstances of this case are like a ring, connected to form a consistent fact. It is necessary to strengthen each ring before it can form the entire case. If any part of the ring is broken, then this consistent fact will immediately collapse. Now, in terms of evidence, such as the handgun found under the wooden pavilion, it is unreasonable. The location where the bullet was found and the location where the deceased fell, the bullet has no blood stains, and the book for hiding the gun is suspicious. The book</p>
<p>The Rust in the Hole</p>
<p>And the Cut Marks Around the Hole, etc., are all sufficient to break it with one attack. It is difficult to convict based on these. Moreover, Ye's confession was obtained through torture. Every time he was interrogated, the police first presented Ye's confession, so that one side would interrogate according to the statement, and the other side would confess according to the statement, as if fearing that the crime would not be established. Therefore, from May 6th onwards, Ye confessed everything one by one. What is strange is that he confessed and cried at the same time. Not only was the confession obtained through torture, but the live performance was not out of Ye's own volition. During the performance, he was flanked by two police officers, and the defense lawyers saw it but did not think it was right, but because there was no</p>
<p>Opportunity to Protest,</p>
<p>It Was Certainly Not an Expression of Approval. Moreover, even if his confession was not due to coercion, it must be consistent with the facts in order to be believed. However, an investigation shows that there are many inconsistencies between Ye's confession and the facts investigated, which are insufficient to adopt. However, the result of the initial trial was the opposite, etc. Finally, the lawyer further deduced the death of Nakayama Hideo, saying that based on his actions that day, it seemed possible that he was a casualty of amorous circumstance. Finally, Inspector Lin made a few statements in his plea. After the debate was concluded, the court announced that the verdict would be announced on the afternoon of the 9th of this month. Yang and Ye were taken back into custody by the detectives. It was already after 6 o'clock when the court adjourned.</p>

<p>Guangdong Fellow Provincial Association Plans to Build New Headquarters: The Guangdong Fellow Provincial Association in Shanghai finds its current headquarters on Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession too far from the residential area of fellow provincials, causing inconvenience for the association's activities. There has long been a proposal to find a new location near Hongkou to build a new headquarters. However, due to the impact of the current situation, it was indefinitely postponed. Yesterday, the association held its 22nd executive board meeting and decided to actively proceed with the plan, appointing five directors, including Li Dachao, Li Ze, Guo Qiming, Chen Fengyuan, and Chen Qifen, to be responsible for planning and preparation. The association also noted that there are no fewer than one hundred and several dozen Guangdong and overseas Chinese organizations in Shanghai, but they mostly operate independently without coordination. Therefore, they have initiated Guangdong and overseas Chinese organization luncheon meetings, held once a month, to promote the development of public undertakings for fellow provincials.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Although Li Zhenzhong was Invited to Help, the Xin Team Still Lost to Xintong - 29 to 41 <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The first game of the current West Youth Basketball Tournament last night was declared sold out because Li Zhenzhong was invited from Beijing to Shanghai to help the Xin team defeat the Xintong Sea Robber team. There was almost no standing room in the West Youth Gymnasium. However, the result of the game was that the Xin team ultimately failed to crush the Sea Robber's edge and, with a score of 29 to 41, still allowed the Sea Robber to maintain its undefeated reputation in the league. The score at halftime was 15 to 10, with Xintong also leading. In another game, the Mai team defeated Qingguang by a large margin, with a score of 65 to 30.</p>
<p>Lack of Cooperation</p>
<p>The Xin team's defeat, in a nutshell, was due to the team's lack of coordination. The participation of Li Zhenzhong and Xu Zhaoxiong made it even more difficult for the team to cooperate. Although it was a good strategy for Li Zhenzhong to switch to defense to monitor the tall Lan Yin's shooting, it did not have a significant effect. The accurate shooting of Shi Guiya and Peisel and the ingenious tactics of Carson and others ultimately forced the Xin team, which was like a heap of loose sand, to concede defeat. Xintong's familiarity with pure teamwork was no accident. Feng Nianhua's performance was the best on the Xin team. Li Zhenzhong could not accomplish anything alone, and Xu Zhaoxiong was of no use.</p>
<p>Seven Points Behind</p>
<p>At the start of the game, the Xin team had Feng Nianhua and Li Zhenzhong as left and right forwards, Chen Xianglong in the center, and Sun Baoqing and Lu Zhongen as guards. Later, due to the pressure in the backcourt, when the score was 7 to 11, Xu Zhaoxiong entered the game to take Li's position, and Xianglong was taken off the court. The situation was very tense, but the Xin team ultimately had no hope of advancing, and the score difference remained at six or seven points. The halftime score was 15 to 10.</p>
<p>Impossible to Save</p>
<p>At the start of the second half, after some initial resistance, Feng Nianhua scored twice, bringing the score to 16 to 19, which seemed promising. It was also the closest the overall score came. However, Shi Guiya, Lamb, and Jin scored six consecutive points, bringing the score to 16 to 25. The Xin team was in danger again. After 22 to 29, Chen Xianglong entered the game and Xu Zhaoxiong was taken off again, but the situation did not improve. The Xin team's defense occasionally made mistakes, and Peisel and Lan Yin scored one after another. Shi Guiya scored three goals in an instant, and the score jumped to 39 to 23. The Xin team suffered a major blow, and although they struggled to the utmost, they were at the end of their rope. The outcome was thus determined, and the final result was 29 to 41 in favor of Xintong.</p>

(Level C) Graduates of provincial rural normal schools and those who have not passed the examination and verification. (Level D) Graduates of provincial and county teacher training classes and those who have passed the examination and verification. (Level E) Those who meet the qualifications of substitute teachers in elementary school regulations. (3) The monthly salary of elementary school teachers must be determined according to the aforementioned qualifications and grades, with a difference of 2 to 4 yuan between each grade. However, the starting salary for each grade must be in accordance with the following regulations: (Level A qualification) starting salary of at least 20 yuan; (Level B qualification) starting salary of at least 18 yuan; (Level C qualification) starting salary of at least 16 yuan; (Level D qualification) starting salary of at least 14 yuan; (Level E qualification) starting salary of at least 12 yuan. (4) Elementary school principals in junior primary schools will be promoted by one grade; those with three grades will be promoted by one and a half grades, and so on. (5) Full-time teachers in senior primary schools will be promoted to the starting salary; those who concurrently serve as principals of elementary schools with two grades will be promoted by one grade, those with four grades will be promoted by three grades, and so on. (6) Junior primary schools shall have one teacher per grade. For grades with an average of 40 children or more, one subject teacher may be added. Teachers who teach all subjects in a grade may be promoted one grade for every seven children exceeding 35 children. Teachers who teach three grades may be promoted one grade for every ten children exceeding 40 children, but the maximum number of children per grade is limited to 60. (7) Senior primary schools shall have two full-time teachers and one subject teacher per two grades. For each grade with 40 or more children, the full-time teacher may be promoted by half a grade, and for every five children over 40, they shall be promoted once in proportion. If a school has only senior grades or only one grade, it shall be calculated accordingly. (8) If the actual number of children in each grade of a senior primary school is less than 30, the full-time teacher will be demoted by one grade; if the salary is less than 25, the school will be suspended or merged. If the actual number of children in each grade of a junior primary school is less than 25, the full-time teacher will be demoted by one grade; if the salary is less than 30, the school will be suspended or merged. (9) Teachers who have been promoted due to an increase in the number of children may be demoted at any time in accordance with the reduced number of children if the number of children decreases. (10) The number of children stipulated in the above articles may be increased or decreased by the counties in accordance with local conditions, subject to approval by the Education Department. (11) Principals and teachers who work hard and have excellent performance, and have been commended or praised by provincial and county supervisors, may be promoted by one or two grades. Those who continue to strive for excellence after promotion may be promoted again, but those who are declining in performance may be demoted at any time. (12) Staff who have already been given additional labor remuneration in various counties may be promoted by several grades as appropriate to maintain their original treatment, but thereafter they may be promoted or demoted at any time in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article. (13) Each school should submit the resumes and supporting documents of the teachers it intends to hire to the Education Bureau or the first department of the county government for verification of the starting salary grade within one month before the start of each semester. If the qualifications are not met, the department may order the school to hire another teacher or directly appoint one.

Standards that have been originally established and the corresponding budget exceeded what has been set in this new method need to have the starting salary grade raised. Those budgets that do not meet this minimum requirement need to have funds allocated to fill in that difference.

<h3 id="e156">Overview of Shanghai Municipal Council Elementary Schools (5) <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Special Report by This Newspaper, Investigation by Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>12. Medical Facilities</p>
<p>Medical services for students in the Municipal Council's elementary schools are provided by the School Medical Office established by the Municipal Council's Health Department. The School Medical Office was established in December of the 20th year and operates under the guidance of the Director of the Health Department. It assists the Education Department in providing medical care for students in all Chinese elementary schools. The Health Department employs one Western school medical officer, two Chinese school medical officers, and five Chinese school nurses with specialized training and experience, who are responsible for examining the physical condition of children in various elementary schools, as well as detecting, preventing, and treating some of the students' illnesses.</p>
<p>According to the School Medical Report for the 24th year, a total of 1,967 students from four elementary schools were examined throughout the year, including 1,351 boys and 616 girls. As a result of the school medical officers' examination of the physical condition of 1,967 students, the following deficiencies were discovered:</p>
<p>Suffering from Trachoma: 1,113 students</p>
<p>Suffering from Infectious Skin Diseases: 442 students</p>
<p>Suffering from Heart Defects: 864 students</p>
<p>Suffering from Lung Defects: 395 students</p>
<p>Suffering from Tonsil Defects: 1,252 students</p>
<p>Suffering from Visual Defects: 89 students</p>
<p>Suffering from Ascariasis: 188 students</p>
<p>Suffering from Other Diseases: 78 students</p>
<p>After examining the children's physical condition, the school medical officers handle the cases in three ways: (1) For children whose physical condition is satisfactory in all aspects, the Medical Office informs their parents that the student can continue to attend school as usual; (2) For children who have some deficiencies in their physical condition, but are not contagious or do not affect other students, the Medical Office informs their parents to seek medical treatment, but the student can still attend school as usual; (3) For children who suffer from infectious diseases that are likely to affect the health of other children, the Medical Office informs their parents to seek immediate medical treatment, and the student is not allowed to attend school. Due to insufficient funds and equipment, the School Medical Office is temporarily unable to treat common illnesses in children.</p>
<p>When children arrive at school each day, the class teacher checks them over every morning. Children who are ill or suspected of being ill are sent by the class teacher to the principal's office and then to the school medical officer for examination. If the medical officer confirms that the student is ill, the student is sent back home and their parents are asked to seek immediate medical treatment. If the student suffers from an infectious disease, they must be isolated for a certain period before returning to school. The relevant classrooms in the school will be disinfected immediately to prevent the spread of infection. The length of the isolation period depends on the nature of the infectious disease. After a sick student recovers, they must first go to the School Medical Office for examination. Only after the medical officer proves that the student has recovered and issues a certificate of recovery can the student return to school with the certificate. In total, the number of sick students in all schools in the 24th year was 1,084; of these, 562 dropped out due to illness, and 522 recovered and returned to school.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Cotton Yarn Prices Fluctuate Greatly; Rising and Falling Suddenly; It Can Only Be Called Speculation; As a Result, Prices Rose Again by 1.2.3.4 Yuan Compared to the Previous Day; The Equivalent in Silver Taels Has Reached 192 Taels, Exceeding the Price of Third-Grade Yarn by More Than Ten Yuan <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is unpredictable, and the situation is as chaotic as hemp. The bulls and bears are both strong. In the early morning, general floating traders had overnight market buy orders. At the opening, the rising trend was sharp, jumping up three or four yuan. Subsequently, profit-taking led to a sharp and tragic fall. The opening in the afternoon was still flat, but after one round, it started to jump up. This month, a high of 260 yuan was discovered, plus the consolidated tax of 8.58 yuan (equivalent to more than 192 taels in the old standard), which has exceeded the high price of the past five years. As for the spot yarn transactions, they have turned sluggish due to the high price. The Shanghai futures yarn price is more than ten yuan higher than the Osaka third-grade yarn. In fact, both parties are trading, and there are too many chips. The bulls are pushing up the price and squeezing the shorts too much, so the market is showing signs of a collapse.</p>
<p>Rising and Falling, Falling and Rising</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the labeled yarn market, due to the previous day's limit up, panic among investors reached its peak. General retail investors were eager to cover their positions, and the market situation was unusually mixed. The December contract surged 4.2 yuan, the December-January contract rose 3.9 yuan to 2 yuan, and the March contract rose only 0.5 yuan. Unexpectedly, at the second round of trading, the Osaka third-grade yarn was calm, and the intermediate term fell by 78 cents. Moreover, the rising trend was too violent, causing a large number of profit-takers to exit the market. At the same time, spot yarn transactions were stagnant due to the high price. The market situation turned sharply downwards, with the December contract falling by 4 yuan and the December-January contract falling tragically by 6.3 yuan to 63 yuan. The closing market was flat, and as a result, the prices of each month were all down from 8 cents to 1.5 yuan and 2.2 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. At the afternoon opening, the near-term contracts were firm and did not move, while the far-term contracts rose by 1 yuan. At the second round, the December contract's rising trend resumed, jumping up 2.9 yuan, and the January contract jumped up by 4 yuan. At the third round, the rising trend became more intense, with the December contract rising to 60 yuan, and the January contract rising by another 4.5 yuan. The far contracts closed up 2.5 yuan. Some profit-takers sold off, causing a retracement of 1.5 yuan to 3.2 yuan. As a result, each month rose by 4.1 yuan to 5.5 yuan compared to the morning close. It was found that Gengfeng sold 6,450 bales, Dafu 1,350 bales, Deda 2,350 bales, Chengji 3,050 bales, Yuda 4,600 bales, Daji 1,350 bales, Mingde 2,100 bales, Shenchang 1,350 bales, Changyu 1,700 bales, Renfeng 2,700 bales, Yuan Yi 1,550 bales, Hengchang 1,050 bales, Tonghe 6,800 bales, Dafeng 7,400 bales, Xincheng 3,000 bales, and Jinchang 1,850 bales. Zhenda bought 3,600 bales, Jifeng 1,450 bales, Dafeng 5,300 bales, Hexing 1,050 bales, Senkang 1,050 bales, Fengtai 2,300 bales, Shenji 2,500 bales, Dachangcheng 5,150 bales, Changfeng 3,600 bales, Dachang 1,050 bales, Hengyi 3,700 bales, Wang Taixing 2,800 bales, Runkang 1,850 bales, Yicheng 1,400 bales, and Fukang 2,150 bales.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Are Still Relatively Stable</p>
<p>It was found that the total amount purchased by various guilds throughout the day was 855 bales, and the selling prices varied. The purchase amounts of each guild are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e158">Futures Cotton Moves in the Opposite Direction to Yarn; Speculative Target Concentrated on Cotton Yarn; There Is Some Short Selling of Cotton <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is falling sharply, which is inversely proportional to the yarn market. In fact, there is sufficient stock in this port, and speculators have focused their targets on cotton yarn, with some short selling on cotton. Therefore, the market is relatively loose. However, the price difference between cotton and yarn is too large, and it is difficult to loosen it completely for the time being.</p>
<p>Far-Month Contracts Fall Below the 3 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the labeled cotton market, the market was very weak, and the prices of all months fell in unison, and the falling momentum was very strong. This is because there is an overabundance of cotton in this port, and there is also spot selling during the big rise. Therefore, the cotton market is relatively weak, causing the far-month contracts to fall below the 3 yuan mark. As a result, the closing prices of all months fell by 58 cents compared to the previous day. At the afternoon opening, the market situation turned upward, driven by the tight yarn market. The second round rose by another 2 cents. By the third closing, the market turned downwards due to the dumping by large players. It was found that Hengyi sold 16,200 dan, Mingde 18,100 dan, Chengji 2,300 dan, Zhenda 5,900 dan, Daqing 3,000 dan, Gengfeng 6,300 dan, Xingchang 4,100 dan, Fengtai 4,900 dan, Wang Taixing 1,600 dan, Yuan Yi 1,200 dan, Hengchang 6,400 dan, Dachang 3,700 dan, Xincheng 8,000 dan, Yichang 5,100 dan, Xiecheng 4,200 dan, Senkang 4,000 dan, and Changhe 5,300 dan. Changfeng bought 19,700 dan, Runkang 13,200 dan, Yuan Xingchang 13,100 dan, Tonghe 3,300 dan, Shenchang 5,000 dan, Juxing 4,900 dan, Hexing 6,200 dan, Taixing 6,600 dan, Ruida 3,800 dan, Changyu 5,200 dan, and Dachangcheng 10,100 dan, Taichang 4,400 dan.

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with good news from Liverpool. Domestic and foreign counterparts bought in, and the prices of all months rose by 3 to 8 points. The amount of bullish liquidations and New Orleans sell-offs was absorbed. Counterparts bought near-month contracts, foreign merchants needed far-month contracts, and some were transferring near-month contracts to far-month contracts, and some were hedging between Liverpool and New Orleans. Spot cotton was firm, and the cloth market was more expensive. Later, the bulls liquidated, and the rising trend slowed down. At the close, public buying saw a rebound. Spot cotton rose 15 points, and futures rose 8 to 16 points. British spot cotton was unchanged, and futures rose 45 points. Indian cotton exporters bought in large quantities, and brokers sold off Pingguol and Aomura, while speculators sold off Bairuo Creek. It is calculated that Pingguol rose half a rupee, Aomura rose 0.5 to 0.75 rupees, and Bairuo Creek rose 0.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (daily telegram).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 2nd was: Bairuo Creek 119.5 rupees, up 1.25 rupees; Aomura 198.25 rupees, up 1.25 rupees; Pingguol 161.25 rupees, up 1.1255 rupees.</p>

<p>According to a telegram from Bombay on the 30th, the amount of cotton exported from Rangoon last week was 1,143 tons, of which 714 tons were to Kobe, 323 tons were to Osaka, 89 tons were to Mowei, and 18 tons were to Yokohama.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Piece Goods; Cotton Cloth Rising Trend Becoming More Intense; Heavyweight White Twill Flannel Rising by 56 Cents; Prices in Various Places Also Rising Sharply Due to the Influence of the Shanghai Market <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market situation, with the unprecedented rise in yarn prices yesterday and today, was exciting, reaching its peak, and the rising trend of piece goods became more and more intense. The selling prices changed rapidly. Compared with the market on the previous day, white cloth, fine twill, raw cloth, grey cloth, and coarse cloth jumped (per piece) by 1.2 cents. Blue cloth, shirting, printed flannel, and woolen cloth rose (per piece) by 1.2.3 cents. Spot goods in the market were in great shortage, and customers had difficulty getting goods and were in urgent need, so they offered high prices to buy them. For example, the small amount of heavyweight white twill flannel sold at a price that jumped (per piece) by 5.6 cents. Only printed drill, serge, crepe de chine, and colored drill goods were weak in sales due to seasonal reasons. Although the price of grey cloth continued to rise, the recent market has seen a fall (per piece) of 2 cents. Although the shirting selling price was slightly firm, sales were still sluggish. However, blue cloth and colored twill were in increased demand from customers, and there was a shortage of supply of grey cloth, so the market followed the fine cloth and fine twill, advancing steadily. Local sales markets of various customer guilds were excited by the rise in the Shanghai market, and the upward trend was also rapid, so the market price rose more quickly.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Grain; Flour Futures Rise and Fall Irregularly; A Big Rise Followed by a Small Retracement Is Also Natural <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices of each month showed a trend of rising first and then retracing to the previous level. At the beginning of the opening, due to the Chicago quotation, the near-term rose by 1.0 yuan and the far-term rose by 0.5 to 0.1 yuan, etc. Canadian flour rose by 45 cents, so after the opening, the current month once rose to 4.025 yuan, which was 4 cents higher than the previous day. The rising momentum of the months below January was also strong, and trading was very active. The April contract alone rose by 6 cents. Then, a large number of profitable bulls withdrew, and the factories also sold new chips, so the market gradually fell, down 34 cents from the highest point. By the afternoon opening, the prices of flowers and yarn rose but fell back, people's hearts were again empty, and the factories continued to sell, so the near-term and far-term contracts fell by 34 cents. In the last few rounds, the current month to February fell by 23 cents compared to the previous day, and MarchApril was still 1 cent better. This kind of irregular rise and fall situation seems to be speculation in heat again.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Wheat Prices Continue to Rise and Then Fall Back <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after the opening in the morning, the prices of each month showed a stable start followed by a very fierce reversal. At the beginning of the opening, due to the quotation of foreign wheat, it continued to rise by 1.0 yuan, followed by a rise of 1 cent to 45 cents. Therefore, the market was very firm, and the opening prices of each month were better by 12 cents to 34 cents. However, because the market value was too high, the buyers were unable to raise the prices at will. When it came to the opening in the afternoon, because the flour market fell back, the general profit-taking bulls also withdrew one after another, causing the selling to be smooth and the market to fall sharply by 678 cents. After that, the situation could not be measured by common sense due to the unpredictable changes in the situation. In the current wheat market, customers sold back and the price was called up by another 1.5 cents, and Fufeng opened 6,000 bags, eating up to 6.35 yuan at the highest price, followed by 1.5 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e166">The Problem That Ordinary Rice Is Facing Is Having No Outlet <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's ordinary rice market situation remained flat and soft. Although the outgoing of local rice was active, the supply was greater than the demand, and the market continued to be weak. Recently, the source has been 10,000 to tens of thousands of bags per day, while the digestion is only 34,000 to 67,000 bags. The Guangdong guild, which used to be a major outlet, has been silent for a long time, which is the main reason for the weakness of the market. Although there was some embellishment yesterday, it was ultimately too slight to cause people's hearts to go up. Moreover, when the inter-provincial transportation was implemented, and the prices of yarn, flowers, flour, wheat, oil, and beans in the Shanghai market soared, it caused the production area dealers to transport as much as possible, leading to a slump. If sales to Guangdong and North China were to be smooth again, the market price would recover quickly. Because rice is the main food for the people, most people in the industry are optimistic about it. The whole day's openings included 4,300 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,640 bags of Ningbo and Wenzhou rice, and 200 bags of Jiangbei rice, and the prices were similar to those of the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e167">The Arrival of Rice at Hexia Turned Decadent; Some Rice Boats Were Detained and Not Allowed to Pass <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>(North Shanghai) It was recently heard from the interior that the export of steamed buns was quite prosperous, so the neighboring counties blocked rice boats from crossing the border to Shanghai in the Jiwang Temple section the night before for the sake of the people's food. There are currently forty to fifty rice boats being detained. Yesterday morning, customers came to report to the Rice Industry Association, and the executive members Fu and Jiang went to request the county government to dredge and release the rice to Shanghai. It will not be clear until the day after tomorrow. Yesterday, the arrival of goods at Hexia was scarce, and the price of white rice increased by several cents to one cent. Bo Dao's sales to customers were quite good, and the price increased by seven or eight cents. The price of Yang Du Bu Ke Jian also increased by one cent. The prices of all other goods increased by nearly one cent.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of one hundred companies arrived from various guilds, with a total of 21,200 shi of goods, half of which was thick and thin japonica rice. The reception of Bo Dao rice was still relatively active, with more than 6,000 bags from Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao guilds, so the initial market was quite tight, and the market price rose by five cents. However, later, due to the relationship between identifying the quality of rice and the accuracy of samples, the buyers and sellers were again in a situation of disagreement, and there was no definite way until about 5 pm, so they dispersed without results, causing the prices of Bo Dao rice from various guilds to fail to open. The sales of thick japonica rice to urban and rural shops and customers have improved slightly, and the customer guilds have also sold 1,200 to 1,300 bags, so the market price has recovered by a few cents. The situation of Du Jian rice is similar, only Yang Jian rice has not seen ups and downs due to the high price. Yin Yuanhua is in a stable situation due to the scarcity of the source.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Finance; Although Pure Gold Has Fallen Sharply, the Gold Market Still Has Active Buyers — Resulting in a Rise of Two Cents — <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Although the pure gold market fell sharply yesterday, large players in the market still built their buying position, and the market was firm. Although it was weak in the middle due to the unloading of spot companies, the result was still stable. In the early morning, due to the rise of the silver market in the United States and the United Kingdom overseas, the big foot said that the seller demanded more than 0.0625 after the closing, and there were still few transactions. The forward silver price in Mondeli rose by 6.5 to 7 cents, and the exchange rate was flat.

<h3 id="e171">Miscellaneous Jiangxi Specialty: A Large Shipment of Nanfeng Honey Tangerines Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Nanfeng honey tangerines are small in size with thin skin, few seeds, no residue, and a taste as sweet as honey, hence the name "honey tangerine." They have a fragrant aroma that lasts for a long time, and can moisten the lungs, quench thirst, regulate qi, resolve phlegm, generate fluids, and treat coughs. The peel and the fibrous strands can both be used as medicinal ingredients, and have the effect of dispelling cold and wind. They are the best choice for fruit baskets and a giant amongst tangerines. However, due to limited production and inconvenient transportation, this renowned product, famous throughout the country, has not been able to reach major cities. As a result, they were previously tribute items, and few common people had the opportunity to taste them. The Jiangxi Provincial Rural Cooperative Business Committee has organized tangerine farmers to promote cooperative sales, hoping to facilitate the flow of goods. Moreover, the selling price is not high, which is good news for gentlemen in Shanghai who like to eat tangerines. It is reported that the four major companies on Nanjing Road and Guanshengyuan China National Products Company are acting as sales agents.</p>

<p>Recently, the metal market has been very good. Overseas telegrams frequently report increases. For example, bamboo steel bars have risen to six pounds and nine shillings, sixteen shillings better than before. New iron products (such as foreign coin sheets, angle iron, and square iron) have also risen to six pounds and five shillings, a more robust ten shillings or so higher than before. Although transactions have not been seen, people's confidence and market sentiment have expanded extraordinarily. Therefore, the market prices of steel bars and new iron products in this port have also increased by several jiao to several yuan. English steel plates are sold in this port at twelve or thirteen yuan for two and a half li, ten yuan for half a fen, nine yuan and five jiao for seven and a half li, and eight yuan and seven or eight jiao for one fen. Overseas market prices have also increased by one or two pounds. It is said that transactions in seven and a half li are particularly strong. It is reported that three to four thousand dan were opened yesterday and handled by the Qingdao gang.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Silk and Tea: Tsatlee Silk Remains Popular and Strong, Rising Ten Yuan Over Last Week <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Yokohama silk market sharply declined. Spot prices plummeted by thirty-five yuan, and futures fell sharply by thirty-nine yuan. New York also followed with a sharp drop. Standard silk for both near and distant terms fell by five and a half to six cents, equivalent to a drop of about twenty-six yuan and six jiao in the Shanghai market. Prices for all raw silk items in New York were uniformly down by a little over two cents. The Lyon silk market felt quite numb. Except for Wentung silk, which rose by one franc due to the previous day's New York rebound, all other silk products opened at the original price. The Shanghai silk market was even more depressed. A telegram from New York indicated a purchase limit of 750 yuan for White Factory B grade. Details of the transaction are currently unknown. Indochina Tsatlee silk and other types remained popular and strong, selling at 605 yuan in the afternoon, a strong rise of [ten] yuan over last week. Therefore, domestic silk merchants and hoarders are even more eager to hoard goods, but judging from the overseas silk market, it does not seem to be so optimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Chinese Silk May Have No Foothold in the U.S., Squeezed by Japanese Silk and Pushed Aside by Italian Silk <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>According to a report released by the Silk Association of America on New York's raw silk inventory, sales, and imports for November, business was quite good for raw silk in New York this month. The total amount of raw silk imported was 50,814 bales, an increase of 6,974 bales compared to last month and 9,121 bales compared to the same month last year. The total consumption was 40,401 bales, a decrease of 2,692 bales compared to last month, but an increase of 2,389 bales compared to the same month last year. The total ending inventory was 10,713 bales, an increase of 10,413 bales compared to last month, but a decrease of 1,403 bales compared to the same month last year. Looking at the evolution of the various figures, it is not difficult to infer the current trend of the silk market. Furthermore, although Shanghai silk exports to the United States increased by 480 bales in November compared to October, they decreased by about 1,400 bales compared to last year. In terms of consumption, the amount in November decreased by 183 bales compared to the previous month and 1,332 bales compared to the same month last year. The total ending inventory was 2,066 bales, an increase of 336 bales compared to last month and a decrease of 2,795 bales compared to the same month last year. Looking at these statistics, the decrease in the ending inventory is a good phenomenon, but the significant decline in imports and consumption is cause for concern. At the same time, the sudden rise of European silk exports to the United States is evident when comparing this year's figures with last year's. Regardless of imports or consumption, the increase in these figures gradually surpasses that of Shanghai silk. Therefore, the export of Chinese silk is not only squeezed by Japanese silk but also pushed aside by Italian silk. Even if the European and American silk markets can be better, it is still difficult to be very optimistic about the sale of our Chinese silk. Moreover, the Shanghai silk market often feels like there are accounts but no goods, or goods that are difficult to sell. The November New York raw silk statistics, along with figures from the previous month and the same month last year, are listed below for comparison.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was stable. The guild set the price for 24 coarse granulated white sugar spot at 21.5 yuan, and transit goods at 6.1 yuan, with slight transactions. There were not much change in the spot and transit goods of Dongbai 489. The market price of the cotton white Zhenji No. 1 from this factory was 20.4 yuan for No. 13145, and the tide gang opened 405 boxes of Beihai flake Qing sugar at a price of 10.3 yuan. Also, 32 packages of Chengxing red sugar at 14.85 yuan, a slight increase of two or three jiao. Furthermore, premium Qing sugar from Qingyuan at 11.2 yuan, with 89 pieces traded. In addition, dozens of packages of Huizhou white sugar at 19.4 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the joint venture company held its second bidding session of the week for Guangdong sugar, with a total quota of 13,001 bags. The bidding prices were the same as before. 570 bags of coarse white sugar from Shunde Factory's Five Rams brand were sold at 21.3 yuan, and another 20 bags from the City New Factory at 21.1 yuan, and 130 bags from Shantou at 10.9 yuan. The remaining bids were not successful at the original price.</p>

<p>Longkou fine vermicelli has recently become popular with winter sales. Purchases have been made from the Upper Yangtze and inland areas for days, so the market situation has suddenly turned tight. It is said that merchants once opened 100 packages at 26.5 yuan, an increase of about two yuan compared to before. At the same time, the increase in the market price was relatively poor, with (92 skin) selling at 24.78 yuan. According to news from the producing areas, each package needs to be priced at 34 yuan.

<h3 id="e177">The Responsibility and Future of the Chinese Academic Society <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— He Bingsong</p>
<p>Our country lags behind in everything, including academic research. Academic research is the foundation for the progress of all undertakings, so we must catch up quickly. However, we must not only discuss the old knowledge to make it more precise, but also cultivate new knowledge to make it more profound. The work is complex, and the responsibility is heavy. We want to seek the independence of Chinese academics and contribute to the progress of human civilization. It is imperative to unite comrades across the country and work together to succeed. If we use this meaning to evaluate our Chinese Academic Society, then we cannot help but admire the correctness and breadth of vision of the group of people who organized the society two decades ago. Now, the society has existed gloriously for twenty years. In these twenty years, the society, with the combined efforts of all members, has published more than one hundred special works and more than one hundred and fifty magazines. Although this achievement is not surprising, it is indeed worth our commemoration. Over the past twenty years, those who have presided over the society's affairs, those who have maintained the society, and all the more than nine hundred members have spent countless energy and effort to build the society into its current important academic position. We should pay tribute to them with gratitude.</p>
<p>In recent years, it seems that some members of the society feel that the society's business is limited to research and publication, and the scope is too narrow. They want to strive to contribute to practical undertakings, expressing the society's enthusiasm for serving the country and society. This spirit of service is certainly admirable. Especially at this time of national hardship, all our members should remember to catch up and do their best to promote the movement to revitalize the nation.</p>
<p>However, in my humble opinion, academic groups should not rush for quick success. It seems that academic research should still be its most important task. When we have spare energy, we may as well incidentally handle some undertakings that are directly beneficial to society, but we must never despise or even sacrifice our primary task because of this.</p>
<p>In fact, all construction undertakings in modern civilized countries cannot be separated from academic research as their prerequisite and basis. For example, the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan and the United States' New Deal are all crystallizations of the research experience of experts in various disciplines in those countries, and they are implemented by the government. Recently, the most important point in the reform of the administrative structure by the Japanese military is the strengthening and expansion of the central research institutions. All this is enough to prove the importance of academic research in the construction of modern countries and societies.</p>
<p>Our Chinese Academic Society has a glorious history of twenty years, and we have more than nine hundred experts in various disciplines as our members. Moreover, we have successively published more than one hundred special works and more than one hundred and fifty magazines, and the foundation is extremely solid. We should adhere to the original intention of the founders and the original intention of those who maintain the society, continue to shoulder the responsibilities that academic groups should bear, and jointly make our greatest efforts in academic research.</p>
<p>If our original series of books can continue to be published continuously, and their content can be improved; if our original academic journals can increase the number of issues and pages in quantity and enrich the categories and content in quality, then we can not only tell the founders and the maintainers of the society that we are not guilty, but also give a satisfactory account to all members and the people of the country. In short, in my humble opinion, if we want to promote and carry forward our Chinese Academic Society, we should continue our spirit of hard research and continue to contribute our research results to the society as a gift from the society to our country and nation. Based on the past enthusiasm of all members for caring for the society, the future of our Chinese Academic Society is boundless, and that can be predicted. Let us all shout three cheers for the Chinese Academic Society!</p>

<p>— Fu Biao</p>
<p>The Chinese Academic Society (hereinafter referred to as "this Society") was founded in the fifth year of the Republic of China by Chen Qixiu, Wang Zhaorong and other forty-seven students studying in Japan, with the aim of studying truth, promoting academics, exchanging knowledge, and promoting culture. Because the year was Bingchen, it was named Bingchen Academic Society. It was established on December 3 of that year in Tokyo, Japan. The organization is divided into an executive department and a deliberative department. Chen Qixiu was elected as the director of the executive department, and Yang Donglin was elected as the deputy director. Chen Jinkun was initially elected as the head of the deliberative department, but he resigned and was replaced by Luo Ding. In April of the sixth year of the Republic of China, the inaugural issue of the Arts and Sciences Magazine was published. In May of the seventh year of the Republic of China, students studying in Japan returned to China together to fight for the Sino-Japanese military agreement, and society member Wang Zhaorong was even elected as the leader of the National Salvation Corps. At this time, in addition to maintaining the publication of Arts and Sciences to four thick volumes, other society affairs were temporarily suspended. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, many society members returned to China. In October, the Shanghai office of the society was rented at No. 18, Shunkang Lane, Baotong Road, Shanghai. In December of the eleventh year of the Republic of China, society members held a six-week anniversary meeting in Shanghai, and it was resolved that the Shanghai office would act on behalf of the general office. Zheng Zhenwen was publicly elected as the chief secretary to temporarily act as the general secretary. In June of the twelfth year of the Republic of China, the society charter was revised, and the name was changed to the Chinese Academic Society. In January of the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, Zheng Zhenwen was elected as the first general secretary, and the general office was officially established, and the registration was approved by the Ministry of Education. In that month, Wang Zhaorong and He Songling proposed to筹办筹办 the Academic and Art Institute. After a resolution by the General Office's executive meeting, the Preparatory Committee of the Academic and Art University was organized, and a fundraising committee was organized at the same time to actively proceed. In March, the first annual meeting was held at the Hangzhou Provincial Education Association. In March of the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, the Board of Directors of the Academic and Art University was established, Zheng Zhenwen was elected as the chairman of the board, Wang Zhaorong was elected as the president of the Academic and Art University, and the university charter was passed. No. 320 Jing'an Temple Road was rented as the university campus. In September, the Academic and Art University began to enroll students. In that month, the General Office moved into the Academic and Art University. In October, it was planned to hold the second annual meeting in Wuchang, but the war broke out suddenly, and transportation was cut off. In July of the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, the Academic and Art University's funding was stretched. Also, the charter stipulated that students could not belong to any party or participate in any political activities, which was too restrictive and not suitable for the times. Initially, it was planned to move to Qingdao, but it did not succeed, so it was suspended. In August, the General Office moved to No. 83 Carter Road. In October, the Third Pan-Pacific Science Conference was held. The Society sent Wei Yan籌君 to attend and submit two papers. In November, it was decided that the third annual meeting would be held in Guangzhou in March of the following year, but due to the impact of the current situation and transportation obstruction, the meeting was never held. In September of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the General Office moved to No. 35 McLean Lane, North Sichuan Road.</p>
<p>In December of the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the General Office convened the 12th Anniversary Meeting and the Delegates Assembly from all over the country. In view of the changes in the situation and the many obstacles to progress, the Society discussed the plan to revitalize the Society. After discussion, it was decided to organize a Society Affairs Improvement Committee, and Zhou Jingshou was elected as the chairman. In January of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the General Office Construction Committee was established to find land and design plans. On April 1, the Society's charter was revised, changing the executive system to a committee system. In May, the Fourth Pan-Pacific Science Conference was held in Java.

The construction of the Society's headquarters on Aimei Road, Shanghai, also began in this month. In April, at the request of the Ministry of Industry, society members Tang Gu and Lu Zhihong were elected to attend the Industrial Standards Committee. In January of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, the Japanese army invaded Shanghai, and the Society's headquarters on McLean Lane, North Sichuan Road, fell into the war zone, and the Society's affairs almost came to a standstill. In March, the Board of Directors was established in accordance with the new charter, Fu Shishuo was elected as the chairman of the Board of Directors, and Bai Pengfei was hired as the director of the General Affairs Department, and Zhou Changshou was hired as the director of the Editorial Department.

<h3 id="e179">Reflections on the 20th Anniversary of the Chinese Academic Society <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Zhaorong</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Chinese Academic Society, it has been twenty years. During this period, people and things have changed, and the severity of the national crisis has increased, which could not have been imagined when the society was established. It is difficult for scholars to serve the country, and the effect is minimal. Looking back on the past, I am ashamed.</p>
<p>In these twenty years, what the society has presented to the world are: magazines, compilations, collections of papers, various series of books, and photoprinted ancient books. The number of publications is indeed not small. However, other undertakings related to science and art have either failed to proceed due to various reasons, or have proceeded but have not yet shown significant results. This is what we deeply regret. However, the creation of an academic group is very different from the growth of one person, and its lifespan should be calculated in hundreds or thousands of years, and it is definitely not like ordinary people who have the feeling of "how many years does a person live?" Therefore, the society, which is twenty years old, is more appropriately described as still having immaturity and still needs support. However, at the beginning of the establishment of the society, it declared its meaning as: studying truth, promoting academics, exchanging knowledge, and promoting culture. We have adhered to this original intention from beginning to end, hoping to contribute to the country and society through culture and academics.</p>
<p>This kind of cultural undertaking cannot be measured by quick success, but it cannot be stopped for a day. We remember the difficulty of creation, feel the lightness of responsibility, and should always be vigilant and introspect ourselves. If there is progress, we will seek to continue to improve. If there is no success, we must work hard to strive for it. For example, merchants keep daily accounts, monthly settlements, and annual settlements to see their profits and losses. Only by not being complacent can we expect progress. In the past twenty years, although various events have caused the society's affairs to be on the verge of suspension three times, the society has been able to overcome difficulties with the hard work of its members and the assistance of all sectors of society. In the future, if we work hard, we expect that the society's facilities may be different from today in ten or twenty years. The key is that we must not be lazy or complacent, and we must persevere. (Omission)</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 20th anniversary of the society coincides with a time of tension. The borders are threatened, and the country is facing many difficulties. Those who are fighting to defend the country are fighting in the ice and snow. Although we are far away in the rear and our paths are different, our minds are the same. How to contribute to the country is a goal that we must always keep in mind. Different paths lead to the same goal, and we are willing to encourage each other with the people of the country.</p>

<h3 id="e180">The Savior Hero of Rome <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Li Su</p>
<p>Three brave warriors saved Rome from near destruction</p>
<p>(I) On the Walls of Rome</p>
<p>(Senators stood on the city walls, watching the riverbank opposite, seeing the enemy army under the leadership of Lars Porsena advancing towards Rome. The attacking forces had only one way to approach Rome, and that was a narrow path spanning the river.)</p>
<p>Roman A: We must decide on a strategy immediately to ensure the safety of Rome.</p>
<p>B: Our soldiers are retreating again. With our small army, outnumbered, can we be so lucky?</p>
<p>C: If they can safely retreat across the bridge to this side before the enemy arrives, they will have an excellent opportunity.</p>
<p>B: The most important thing is to act immediately, otherwise, we are finished.</p>
<p>C: I propose that our soldiers cross the bridge as soon as they arrive. Once they have all crossed, we can break the bridge, preventing the enemy from catching up.</p>
<p>A: That seems easy, but who is brave enough to stay on the riverbank and resist the enemy, until the bridge is broken?</p>
<p>B: Roman compatriots, look across the river! The enemy has defeated our troops again. Whatever we do, we must do it immediately.</p>
<p>C: Perhaps Horatius will come and give us an idea.</p>
<p>B: Horatius, today is truly a critical day for the survival of Rome. The enemy could invade the city before nightfall unless we take strong measures immediately.</p>
<p>Horatius: I have discussed with my soldiers, and we all believe that there is only one way to save Rome. That bridge must be destroyed.</p>
<p>B: That's exactly what we thought. But how can this be achieved? Unless we leave some men on that side of the bridge to block the enemy's advance.</p>
<p>Horatius: That narrow bridge, three men are enough to resist a hundred enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>A: That is true, but those three men are as good as dead. Where are we going to find three such brave men to confront the entire enemy army?</p>
<p>Horatius: "Death" will come to everyone in this world, sooner or later, and is there a death more glorious than dying for Rome? I am willing to be one of the three. I believe I can find two more comrades.</p>
<p>C: Well said, Horatius!</p>
<p>Horatius: (To his soldiers). I need two men to go with me to block the enemy while this side dismantles the bridge. It will be a hard fight, perhaps a long one. We may not survive. Who is willing to go?</p>
<p>(Two soldiers step forward).</p>
<p>Soldier: I, Spurius Lartius, am determined to follow you.</p>
<p>Horatius: Thank you, Spurius Lartius. You are a brave man and a strong warrior. I know for sure that you can fight a thousand.</p>
<p>Soldier: And I, Titus Herminius, am determined to follow you.</p>
<p>Horatius: Good! With two such soldiers, one on my left and one on my right, the enemy will not be able to reach the bridge without a long fight.</p>
<p>B: Warriors, we in the rear cannot express our gratitude enough. You are heroes who sacrifice your lives to save Rome.</p>
<p>Horatius: We sacrifice for the love of our country and to give freedom to our descendants. We do not want thanks. Come, Spurius Lartius and Titus Herminius. We have fought hard together with the enemy many times, and I am so lucky to be able to be with you two for the last time. Before the enemy arrives, we must first go and hold our position.</p>
<p>(II) The Bridge</p>
<p>(The Roman army has crossed the bridge and entered the city gate, only those dismantling the bridge have not entered, and the dismantling work is almost complete. Horatius and his two soldiers bravely fought to keep the enemy from setting foot on the bridgehead.)</p>
<p>Horatius: The enemy has retreated to plan a new offensive strategy, Titus Herminius. We must take this opportunity to rest.</p>
<p>Titus: Horatius, did you see them laugh when they first saw us? They aren't laughing now!</p>
<p>Spurius: Be careful, they're coming again!</p>
<p>Titus: Then come on! Let's get close to you. They dare not come forward to meet our sword.</p>
<p>Spurius: Dare not, of course they dare not. Look at the corpses in front of us. I am really very tired. If they attack again in large numbers, I dare not guarantee that I can hold on. Are you injured, Titus Herminius? Why are you using your left hand to hold your sword?</p>
<p>Titus: My right hand is injured, but it doesn't matter. Be quiet, Spurius Lartius! Can you hear them calling us from the end of the bridge? What are they saying?</p>
<p>Horatius: Go back, Titus Herminius! Go back, Spurius Lartius, while the bridge is still standing! Go now, friends, before the enemy returns to attack. I will follow you.</p>
<p>Titus: Come on, Spurius Lartius, now is the time!</p>
<p>(The two of them ran over just before the bridge collapsed. Horatius was able to block the enemy because he stayed behind, when his friends retreated. He retreated step by step to the bridge that had fallen into the river.)</p>
<p>(III) The Riverbank on the Edge of Rome</p>
<p>Titus: Stop, Spurius Lartius - we left Horatius alone. Alas, why didn't he follow us immediately?</p>
<p>Spurius: We can't help him now. He needs our help, Titus Herminius; you see the enemy has forced him back!</p>
<p>Titus: Spurius Lartius, that last sword wounded his face very badly. I'm afraid he's lost an eye.</p>
<p>Spurius: What a brilliant warrior! His sword is broken, but he continues to fight.</p>
<p>Titus: I understand what he is doing. He is resisting until he has a chance to jump into the river.</p>
<p>Spurius: He jumped into the river! Well done, Horatius, he would rather kill himself than fall into the hands of the enemy. Titus Herminius, he is too badly injured to reach our bank.</p>
<p>Titus: You are wrong, Spurius Lartius, you are wrong! He is still fighting, fighting the water for his own life!</p>
<p>Spurius: He's almost to the shore! Work hard, Horatius, come this way! The water is carrying him to our bank.</p>
<p>Titus: Come on, Spurius Lartius, let's help him. He must be almost dead.</p>
<p>(They went out into the water and helped Horatius to the bank.)</p>
<p>Spurius: Hey, brave Horatius, if we didn't think you were following us closely behind, we would never have left you.</p>
<p>Horatius: Friends, please help me. I can't see very clearly. We saved Rome today, and we are still alive to fight for it again</p>
<p>Titus: Come into the city, Horatius. The people are calling for you. The senators have seen everything that has happened on the city walls. They must want to thank you, because you have accomplished what they thought was impossible and saved Rome.</p>
<p>Horatius: I'm not a speaker, Titus Herminius, I'm just a soldier. Take me to a place where I can rest. I am very tired. Titus Herminius and Spurius Lartius, you fought so bravely by my side today that I will never forget it.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Shi Kefa <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Yuan</p>
<p>Heroes cannot be judged by victory or defeat; soldiers who defend their territory and are willing to die with the city are heroes.</p>
<p>When the news of Emperor Sizong of Ming's suicide reached Nanjing, the ministers in Nanjing were so panicked that they couldn't speak; they put on white clothes to mourn Sizong, and tried to send troops to avenge him. They believed that a country cannot be without a ruler for a day, and an emperor must first be established before a vow to launch a northern expedition can be justified; so they immediately discussed the "issue of candidates".</p>
<p>At that time, many princes from Beijing had fled to the south. The most notable were Prince Lu Changfang, who lived in Huai'an, and Prince Fu Zhu Yousong. Ministers Zhang Shenyan, Jiang Yueguang, and others said: "Prince Fu is Emperor Sizong's cousin, so he should be established. But he has many shortcomings, such as being greedy, lustful, unfilial, unwilling to read, mistreating servants, and liking to interfere in other people's affairs. Although Prince Lu is Emperor Sizong's uncle, he is very shrewd and capable, and can be established." At the time, everyone had no objection. However, Ma Shiying, the governor of Fengyang, who had heavy troops, wanted to exploit Prince Fu's shortcomings in order to monopolize power in the court, so he sent troops to send Prince Fu to Yizhen, and the ministers in Nanjing had no choice but to welcome him!</p>
<p>Among these many ministers was a Henan native named Shi Kefa. He was short, with a dark complexion and bright, spirited eyes. When the ministers paid homage to Prince Fu, Prince Fu's face was flushed and he wanted to leave. Shi Kefa stopped him and said, "You can't leave. You should sit upright and receive the homage." Afterwards, when the issue of sending troops was discussed, Shi Kefa said: "The prince should wear plain clothes and personally go to the suburbs to inspect the troops, appoint generals, and prepare for a northern expedition, to show the world his determination to avenge the emperor." Prince Fu nodded and said, "Okay, let's do that!" The next day, the ministers established Prince Fu as emperor. Kefa was appointed Minister of Rites, and later changed to Minister of War. Later, he was appointed as the Grand Coordinator of Yangzhou and stationed in Yangzhou to resist the southern invasion of the Qing army.</p>
<p>Although Kefa became the Grand Coordinator, he shared the hardships with the soldiers in the army day and night, never allowing himself to enjoy any special treatment. If the soldiers were not full, he would not eat first; if the soldiers' clothes were not warm, he would never add a piece of clothing to his own. He read official documents late into the night and did not go to sleep; even when he slept, he just lay down in his clothes and dozed off for a while. Once, on New Year's Eve, he was reading official documents until midnight and had not finished. He was already a little tired and wanted to drink some wine to refresh himself. The cook said, "All the good food has been distributed to the soldiers, and there is nothing to go with the wine. Should I make you some more dishes to go with the wine?" Kefa said, "There's no need to bother so much, just bring some salted soybeans." Kefa usually drank a lot and would not get drunk even after drinking several liters; since coming to the military camp, he had not even smelled the aroma of wine. But this time, he drank ten or more bowls in a row, and as he drank, he suddenly thought of Emperor Sizong, and tears burst out like a flood, and he cried loudly. After a while, he was tired and fell asleep on the table.</p>
<p>When dawn broke, the generals gathered outside the gate, but the gate was tightly closed. They had to wait quietly, guessing what was happening. Later, Kefa's personal servant told them the reason; the prefect Ren Minyu said, "It's rare for him to sleep so soundly. Don't wake him up. Quickly tell the watchman to continue striking the fourth watch. You must all be careful not to make any noise." After a while, Shi Kefa woke up, and the sunlight was already shining brightly through the window. The fourth watch was still being struck outside, and Kefa was furious, shouting, "Who dares to disrupt my laws? Quickly arrest the watchman and kill him!" Ren Minyu quickly came to apologize and explained the intention of the instructions, and he did not kill the watchman. Although his military orders were so strict, he often went to the military camp to talk to the soldiers and personally taught them the methods of attack and defense in battle. If a soldier was sick, he would stroke the patient's wounds and ask in detail about the condition of the illness. Sometimes, when he saw a critically ill person about to die, his eyes would fill with tears and he would choke up and be unable to speak. Therefore, the soldiers often said, "Lord Shi is always thinking about us and cherishing us, how can we not fight hard!"</p>
<p>In the second year of Shunzhi (1645 AD), the Qing government's army, led by Prince Yu Duoduo, marched east from Shaanxi, directly back to Guide in Henan Province. More than 30 counties along the way surrendered at the mere sight of them. After the loss of Guide, they invaded Sizhou in Anhui Province. Shi Kefa was planning to send troops to assist Sizhou in resisting the enemy, but unexpectedly encountered Ningnan Marquis Zuo Liangyu of Ming, who attacked Nanjing in the name of killing the powerful officials Ma Shiying and Ruan Dacheng. The Ming government was extremely frightened and ordered Shi Kefa to rush to Nanjing to rescue it. He had no choice but to change his course to Nanjing. Just as he crossed the river to Yanziji, Zuo Liangyu's army had already been defeated. The Ming government wanted him to hold Siyang, so he hurried back to Tianchang and ordered the generals to rescue Gantai. In the midst of the chaos, a scout reported, "Xutai has already surrendered to the Qing army, and the entire army of Hou Fangyu, the general who was supposed to rescue Sizhou, has been wiped out." Upon hearing this report, he was stunned for a long time, and immediately spent a day and a night rushing back to Yangzhou. His eyes filled with tears, he advised the generals to do their best to defend the territory for the country, and at the same time issued a declaration to the various garrisons to send troops to rescue them.</p>
<p>Who knew that the garrisons would not pay attention to him at all? Only General Liu Xixian led 4,000 soldiers, panting, from Baiyanghe, west of Siyang. He asked Shi Kefa to take advantage of the fact that the Qing soldiers had not yet fully arrived and launch a battle against the city to blunt the enemy's momentum. Shi Kefa did not agree with his opinion, saying, "Rather than fighting in the field, it is better to leave some troops to defend the city and wait for reinforcements from various places." He sent troops to defend the city on the one hand, and sent official documents to the government asking for reinforcements to be dispatched quickly on the other.</p>
<p>On April 20th, the Qing army had all arrived under the city of Yangzhou, stationed at Banzhuyuan. Li Yuchun, a general who had surrendered, brought Prince Yu's letter of surrender and came to the city to persuade them to surrender. Shi Kefa was very angry when he heard that Li Yuchun had come. He walked to the top of the city and scolded Li Yuchun: "The Ming government did not treat you badly, but you have betrayed your kindness and righteousness and surrendered to the Manchus; what face do you have to see me here?" Yuchun, with a thick face, advised him: "Your loyalty and dedication are known to everyone, both at home and abroad. Don't your friends trust you? But now that treacherous officials are in power, what use is it for you to work hard for them? I think it would be better for you to surrender to the Great Qing. Otherwise, even if you sacrifice your life, the Ming government will not give you any benefits! So I advise you to be a peacemaker, so that the two families can stop fighting, and you can also have high positions and high salaries, and your wife and children can be ennobled. Wouldn't that be a win-win situation?" Kefa was furious and said, "Bah! What nonsense are you talking about! Soldiers, quickly shoot this traitor to death with arrows." The arrows on the city all left the strings and flew towards Li Yuchun. Li Yuchun saw that it was not good and galloped away, but because he ran fast, he managed to escape.</p>
<p>After a while, Duoduo called a villager and sent a letter to the moat, asking the guards to explain that he wanted to meet Grand Coordinator Shi. The guards of the moat reported to Shi Kefa, and Kefa lowered a strong soldier from the city and threw the villager and the letter into the water.</p>
<p>Duoduo knew that Shi Kefa loved his country sincerely and respected him very much; the more he respected him, the more he wanted him to surrender. So he ordered the generals to temporarily not attack the city and wrote a tactful letter to Kefa, advising him to surrender. Kefa, upon seeing it, also resolutely rejected it. He threw the letter into the fire to be burned. Prince Yu knew that Kefa's heart could not be moved by words, so he gave the order to attack the city again.</p>
<p>The next day, Gao Qifeng, the supervising vice envoy, and others left the city and surrendered to the Manchus, and the military strength in the city became even weaker. The people's hearts were uneasy, and the civil and military officials in the court all personally went to the city to guard it. At this time, Shi Kefa wrote a letter to his mother and wife, saying goodbye to them. He also calmly instructed his general Shi Dewei: "If I die, please bury my body next to Emperor Gao's Mausoleum. If that is not possible, then bury it under Plum Blossom Ridge!" After saying that, he put on his armor and rushed to the most dangerous West Gate of the old city to defend it.</p>
<p>The more firmly the city was defended, the more fierce the attack became. The Qing soldiers besieged Yangzhou so tightly that no water could escape, attacking day and night. Shi Kefa was anxious. He attacked the enemy with cannons, killing several thousand people. Seeing this situation, the commander-in-chief of the Qing army personally led a death squad to attack the city. Suddenly, a loud noise like thunder exploded in the northwest corner of the city, and it collapsed. The Qing soldiers took advantage of the gap and rushed in. The Ming soldiers defending the city did not show weakness and stood firm, desperately firing arrows at the people climbing the city. The corpses under the city piled up like a mountain; the enemy soldiers stepped on these corpses one by one and ascended the city. Thus, the flags of the Manchus were raised on the city.</p>
<p>When the city was under heavy siege, Shi Kefa said to Zhuang Zigu: "If the city is broken, please kill me with your sword first." Zhuang Zigu also agreed. At this time, Shi Kefa stretched out his neck and asked Zigu to cut it. How could Zigu bear to do it? Seeing that he was unwilling, Kefa immediately drew his sword and slashed at his own neck. Zigu was shocked and rushed forward to hug him, snatching the sword from his hand. Although he did not die, his clothes were already stained with red blood.</p>
<p>At that time, Zigu and dozens of others dragged and carried Kefa out of the city. Just as they reached the Little East Gate, the Qing soldiers saw many Ming soldiers walking out of the city and fired arrows at them; Zigu, Xu Jin, and others were all shot to death. Kefa struggled with his injuries and shouted in a loud voice, "I am Grand Coordinator Shi of this city, you can just take me to see your commander-in-chief!" These Qing soldiers were a little disbelieving when they heard that it was Grand Coordinator Shi, but they did not dare to underestimate him; they dragged and pulled him to the South Gate Tower of the new city to see Duoduo.</p>
<p>Duoduo was in the midst of chaos when he saw the soldiers lead in a bloody Ming person. He was very surprised and asked, "Who are you?" Shi Kefa answered calmly, "I am Shi Kefa." Duoduo was surprised that it was Shi Kefa and could not speak for a long time, staring at him with his eyes wide open. After a while, he said, "I admire you very much for defending the isolated city alone. Now that the city has been broken, your loyalty and effort to your country can be considered exhausted. Can you agree to my request and unify Jiangnan for our Qing government?" When Kefa heard that he wanted him to surrender, he pointed his hair at the sky and said loudly, "I am a minister of the Ming Dynasty. The imperial court gave me Yangzhou, but I failed to defend it for him; what face do I have to live in dishonor? Now that I have come here, I only want to borrow your sword to take off my head. I have no other intention, do not misunderstand me." Although Duoduo saw that he spoke with certainty, he still did not give up and said, "Have you not seen our Grand General Hong Chengchou? If you are willing to work for us, you can receive the same benefits as him." Shi Kefa smiled contemptuously and said, "Humph, Hong Chengchou? Can you treat Hong Chengchou better than Emperor Chongzhen treated him? He received so much grace from the imperial court, but he betrayed the imperial court; can he really be loyal to you? I am always ashamed of his treason and hate his lack of conscience; would I go and learn from him?" Prince Yu had nothing to say, but he thought that he was in a fit of rage and that it would naturally not be successful to persuade him to surrender. So he ordered one of his most eloquent generals, named Yierdun, to accompany him and slowly persuade him to surrender, hoping to move his heart.</p>
<p>Yierdun accompanied Kefa for three days and persuaded him for three whole days, but Shi Kefa still refused to surrender. Duoduo knew that Kefa's patriotic loyalty was as strong as iron and could not be shaken, and he was afraid that keeping him would be detrimental to his country. Therefore, Kefa died for his country at their hands.</p>

<p>In recent years, the publishing industry in our country has been very enthusiastic about promoting reading, and reading magazines, reading guides, college entrance examination guides, and books on various subject guides and research methods have sprung up like mushrooms; this is certainly a good phenomenon. However, if we examine this type of book strictly, we will feel dissatisfied; either the editors and authors are sloppy, or the content is repetitive and uninspired. Therefore, supplying students, readers, and researchers with this type of crudely made books will probably be counterproductive to the original intention of the publishers, and will also have great harm to them. At the same time, it will greatly hinder the progress of the reading movement; for this matter, publishers and editors cannot shirk responsibility. While feeling disappointed, we still hope that the publishing industry can publish some good books, such as reading guides, for readers to read.</p>
<p>In the expectations of most readers, The Commercial Press's reading guides have been published one after another; this is certainly a very gratifying thing. The first series of the book has been published for a year, and it is said to be quite popular and well-received by readers. The second series was published only recently, so we think it is necessary to introduce and comment on it. The articles included in Reading Guidance, Series 2, are divided into a total of fifteen categories, totaling thirty-one articles; some of them were not included in the first series, which can be said to have fulfilled the task of supplementing it.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai Yuanpei once pointed out in the preface of the book the advantages that a book of reading guidance should have, namely: "convenient for self-study", "convenient for reference", and "convenient for increasing common sense". Reading Guidance, Series 2, contains these three advantages. The thirty-one articles included in it either contain one of the above advantages, or have two or even all of them. Now, let us cite these articles and add a brief comment; from this, we can imagine how suitable the content of the entire series of articles is for the needs of readers.</p>
<p>First, there is Ma Zongrong's How to Study Library Science? In this short article, he expresses his opinions on the importance of studying library science and experience, and introduces many good books on library science for beginners. This can be said to be a suitable path for them.</p>
<p>Second, there is Zhou Yutong's How to Study Classics? He advocates that researchers should first understand classics before talking about research; and they must have a foundation in philology before research can be carried out without difficulty. He has a special insight into the interpretation and classification of classics. As for how to read classics, he advocates that one should first read simple classics books, and then read problematic and important ones. The final conclusion is this: "To study the classics with the viewpoint of 'history', and to excavate the buried materials in the classics with the viewpoint of social science." This is certainly more novel and applicable than the opinions of some stubborn scholars of the classics.</p>

<h3 id="e185">How to Study Philosophy (3) <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Yilin</p>
<p>Written by Wang Tefu, published by Sanjiang Bookstore</p>
<p>...in order to sort out some clues, order, and boundaries from the complex philosophical content, so that there is a certain theoretical thread to follow when studying. Only in this way can one understand its theories and viewpoints. This kind of analytical work can be said to be a necessary process of clarification when studying philosophy, so it is said that this kind of analytical work is necessary in philosophical research.</p>
<p>5. Comprehensive Research on Philosophy:</p>
<p>The problems in philosophy are fundamentally related and unified. The overall form of philosophy is a whole worldview and outlook on life, a complete spiritual system, rather than fragmented, unrelated theories and thoughts. Because the various problems in philosophy are organically interrelated, comprehensive research should also be carried out simultaneously with analytical research. Understanding parts and individual problems is just as important as understanding the whole and general problems. If we want to establish a whole worldview and outlook on life, and if we want to understand the whole form of philosophy, then comprehensive research on philosophy is necessary. As for how to conduct comprehensive research, on the one hand, we must start with the synthesis between the parts of the object of philosophy, and from this, proceed to the recognition of the whole truth of the world. Then, the form and content of this synthesis will include the relationship and sum of the various parts and the whole of natural philosophy, social philosophy, and even the science of thinking; on the other hand, we should comprehensively consider the various problems of philosophy itself in order to recognize the whole of philosophy and to have a complete system of philosophical thought. In short, if you do not conduct analytical research, but study philosophy in a superficial way, you cannot understand the specific content of philosophy, and therefore it is not easy to obtain an accurate and precise worldview; but if you only do fragmented research, only focus on specific individual problems and ignore the whole picture of philosophy, you still cannot understand the entire philosophical system and obtain the entire worldview. Concrete and detailed research, and systematic and comprehensive research, are research methods that must be used at any time in philosophical research.</p>

<p>Marital Knowledge</p>
<p>— Dr. Zhang Junshi, German Medical Doctor</p>
<h3 id="e186">A Compass for Marital Life <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>...Sexual life is a bridge to communicate the feelings of husband and wife, making them harmonious and without gap... Excessive destruction in youth causes the gonads to decline and weaken, and love often goes bankrupt.</p>
<p>People's hearts are different, each like their face, this sentence speaks for all people in the world. Knowledge, experience, aspirations, hobbies, temperament, there are some differences between each individual. Marriage pulls two men and women together to live a common and harmonious life, in which it is natural to correct the places where the differences are too severe. In marital life, this sacrifice is necessary, but it must have a very strong love in order to be willing to accommodate each other. This kind of love that is harmonious without a gap must have a happy sexual life in order to occur.</p>
<p>Originally, this sexual life broke all the barriers, making the couple intoxicated in each other's arms, enjoying the supreme pleasure. The body and mind of the two people seem to be transformed into one, each feeling that they are just one body of the other. Therefore, unconsciously, they harmonize different habits, temperaments, hobbies, and tastes, so that common life can proceed harmoniously.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, for many men and women, their sexual function is incomplete, and they have no chance to experience the pleasure and happiness of sexual life. Common life has lost its natural bridge, the barriers cannot be opened, and all the coordination work cannot be carried out. The two different personalities are of course extremely prone to conflict in the long-term close contact.</p>
<p>Furthermore, sex is a natural great desire of human beings. If they cannot enjoy it satisfactorily, they will inevitably develop hatred for the other party's weakness, and the couple will turn into enemies.</p>
<p>Most of these tragedies in the world are the fault of the parties themselves. The maturation of sexual function originally proceeds along a normal path in everyone's body. Many unfortunate young men and women, however, commit bad habits such as masturbation and indulgence during the process of development, so that the gonads are destroyed and weakened. Men then have symptoms such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, and short genitalia; women have weak sexual sensation and irregular menstruation.</p>
<p>If you find that you have this disease, never rush to get married; if you find it after marriage, you must be safe and not impatient, and do not despair; men should quickly take "Hemitol's Essence-Strengthening Pills" to stop spermatorrhea and consolidate the essence gate. At the same time, taking the gonad hormone preparation "Gonadogen" will cure premature ejaculation and impotence immediately, and can also make too short genitalia develop and grow. Women should quickly take the female gonad hormone preparation "Female Gonadogen," which can regulate menstruation and restore sexual sensation. In this way, all the shortcomings can be remedied. The happiness and joy of marital life is a matter of course.</p>
<p>This gonad hormone preparation, because it can make energy double and body shape normal, can also be taken as a winter tonic by couples, and will definitely increase a lot of fun in the boudoir.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: "Gonadogen" and "Hemitol's Essence-Strengthening Pills" are generally packed in iron boxes; those seen on the market in paper boxes and bottles are all fake medicines.)</p>
<p>Therapeutic Guidance</p>
<h3 id="e187">Talking About Effective Drugs for Gonorrhea <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Chongpei, Medical Doctor of the University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<p>Treating gonorrhea is a very critical job, and you cannot relax even half a step. If you are a little vague, and the sterilization and detoxification are not complete, acute gonorrhea will become chronic and difficult to treat; chronic gonorrhea and simple gonorrhea can cause various dangerous complications. Therefore, during treatment, you must press on tightly without any slack, so that the gonococcus has no room to breathe, and kill it completely in the shortest period of time.</p>
<p>To realize this treatment method, you must be careful in choosing medicine. First of all, I believe that the use of oral medicine is better than injectable medicine. Because injections must be performed by a doctor, patients are prone to interruption, and the purpose of radical cure cannot be achieved. Oral medicine can be taken by yourself, without interruption or stagnation.</p>
<p>However, the old oral medicines are not precisely prepared, or they can only relieve diuresis and pain, without the power to sterilize; or the medicinal properties are strong, but they can only obtain temporary peace, and cannot cure radically; or they are harmful to the stomach and intestines, and cause other diseases. Because of these shortcomings, oral medicine has no place in previous gonorrhea treatments. However, if it is said that oral medicine has no possibility of becoming an effective medicine, it is inevitably too arbitrary.</p>
<p>The facts prove that recently Dr. Jettelson of Germany has invented an effective oral medicine for gonorrhea, named "Anti-Gonococcus." It has great sterilization ability and can also make the body produce antitoxins. The gonococcus has no chance to penetrate deep into the body to lie dormant, but can only wait there to be bound. Such an effective medicine that kills bacteria and resists toxins at the same time cannot be compared with injectable agents. And it is precisely prepared, with strong and peaceful medicinal power, and has the effect of curing quickly in an orderly manner; absolutely no side effects occur, and it is indeed a holy medicine for treating gonorrhea.</p>
<p>The Enlightenment of Sex</p>
<p>— Doctor Zhan Nianceng</p>
<h3 id="e188">The Relationship Between Masturbation and Neurasthenia <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>...Premature ejaculation, impotence, and obstructed genital development are all symptoms induced by excessive masturbation... Masturbation in childhood often jointly inhibits the development and vitality of the testicles and prostate.</p>
<p>Masturbation is harmful and not beneficial to young people, which is a fact well known to people who know a little medical common sense. However, at what time does this behavior begin to have the most harmful effect? From the perspective of physical constitution, first of all, it is the most obvious in people with the nervous system. In addition, people with adenoid constitution are subject to a relatively large impact. This is because the nervous system is too sensitive and its resistance is too weak.</p>
<p>As for what major diseases are caused by this bad habit? Now let us briefly record the two or three symptoms that are most easily encountered, and then observe them, as follows.</p>
<p>Neurasthenia, this is almost a necessary symptom in many cases. For example, spermatorrhea, which induces premature ejaculation, and in severe cases, even falls into a state of weak erectile power for life, completely losing the performance!</p>
<p>In addition, the earlier people who practice masturbation, the greater the impact on the underdevelopment of the genitals caused by excessive masturbation. That is to say, when giving excessive irritation to the undeveloped genitals in the early age, it causes obstacles to the development of the nervous system; and because of this reason, it stops the development of the genitals. At the same time, the appendages, namely the testicles and prostate, etc., also have many tendencies to be jointly inhibited in their development.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the brain feels swollen and painful, memory is poor, and it is easy to feel tired and fatigued, mentally trance, insomnia, night sweats, and palpitations, etc., which are the diseases that are most easily manifested after excessive masturbation, which is a major problem that hinders the health of young people.</p>
<p>In order to treat this disease, we must first prohibit the act of masturbation, and we must be determined to operate a life that conforms to noble rules. At the same time, we must take "Hemitol's Essence-Strengthening Pills" to treat spermatorrhea, because this agent has the function of consolidating the essence gate and clarifying the will. It is indeed a symptomatic medicine for controlling spermatorrhea. After at most three weeks, the spermatorrhea will stop. As for premature ejaculation, impotence, underdevelopment, and various other neurasthenia symptoms, it is necessary to use the gonad hormone preparation "Gonadogen," which invigorates the gonads and increases endocrine, to treat them. It has truly amazing effects and guarantees a short-term cure, because "Gonadogen" can induce the function of the cavernous nerve plexus to increase and encourage development.</p>
<p>Common Sense of Quitting Smoking</p>
<h3 id="e189">New Contributions to Methods of Quitting Smoking <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yu Bofu</p>
<p>When I first started practicing medicine in my county, I felt the most difficult when I encountered patients who came to quit smoking. During the quitting period, many patients often said: "I was so miserable yesterday that I couldn't bear it, so I had to take another puff of smoke. Is there any way to avoid this pain?" For this situation, apart from persuading him to endure the pain, I really couldn't help at the time. Watching many people give up halfway because of this, I felt very uncomfortable in my heart.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I earnestly studied this problem and tried various medicines. So I absorbed the method of nourishing and strengthening to quit smoking from the new inventions of advanced Western medical countries. The theory on which this method is based is this: the reason for smoking addiction lies in the anesthetic nature of opium. After smoking for a long time, the cells in the body are all like they are drunk, numb and weak, and cannot operate as before; they have to rely on the stimulation of opium to promote their activity and maintain the continuation of life. Therefore, the ideal method of quitting smoking is to directly restore the vitality of all the cells in the body as the first step. If it can make the various systems in the body automatically proceed according to the normal path, then there is no need to stimulate them with opium every day, and the smoking addiction will have no foothold. In order to achieve this goal, we must find ways to make the source of life prosperous, and when the source of energy is smooth, the cells will become active. The gonad is the supplier of the source of life, so the method of nourishing and strengthening to quit smoking is to make the patient take the gonad hormone preparation "Gonadogen" to enhance their gonads, so that the source of life becomes richer day by day. Without opium inhalation, they can also be full of energy, and the painful phenomena that usually appear during the onset of addiction disappear without a trace. After five or six weeks, they can safely quit smoking.</p>
<p>There was a quitter named Liu Ziqin, who was forty-two years old. He had contracted a bad habit at the age of fifteen or sixteen, and had been smoking for more than twenty years. After I gave him a large amount of "Gonadogen" for a period of one and a half months, he quit smoking without pain, did not think about resuming smoking, and his spirit became more energetic, and his body suddenly felt stronger, he said.</p>
<p>Lecture on Venereal Diseases</p>

<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road. Outpatient hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Closed on Sundays.</p>
<p>(1) Frequent Nocturnal Emission, Neurasthenia</p>
<p>Patient Tao Furen, 24 years old, from Longtan, Jiangsu, has been engaged in the porcelain business in Shanghai for five years. (Chief Complaint) - He contracted the bad habit of self-abuse at the age of sixteen, and began to abstain from it after the Spring Festival, but he has suffered from spermatorrhea for eight years. At first, he was ashamed to tell others and did not receive treatment. He has been delayed until now, resulting in a state of neurasthenia. His memory has gradually decreased, his will has become increasingly depressed, he has many dreams and little sleep at night, and he is mentally depressed, tired and weak, his face is pale, his muscles are thin, and symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, and vertigo are coming one after another. This year, the disease worsened, and he was introduced by a friend to be treated four months ago. (Symptoms at Diagnosis) - Brain weakness, essence depletion, spermatorrhea at least four times a week. Even if he is stimulated during the day or works too hard, he can also discharge seminal fluid. The relaxation of his essence gate has reached its extreme. (Treatment Method) - Electrotherapy is performed daily, and he is strictly instructed to take care of himself. He took "Hemitol's Essence-Strengthening Pills" to treat spermatorrhea. After taking the pills, the spermatorrhea stopped completely in less than three weeks. In addition, for the various neurasthenia symptoms he suffered from, he was treated with the gonad hormone preparation "Gonadogen," which was prescribed to be taken three times a day, two tablets each time. After about two months, his spirit was extremely abundant, his complexion was ruddy, and his muscles were firm. Even if he worked for ten hours without stopping, he did not feel any fatigue. At the same time, his brain power was healthy, his sleep was comfortable, and his dizziness and vertigo disappeared without a trace. Especially when he got up in the morning, his spirit was exceptionally strong. The eight-year illness was cured in one day.</p>
<p>(2) Premature Ejaculation and Impotence Cured in Two Months</p>
<p>Patient Zhang Chengwen, 31 years old, from Sichuan. (Chief Complaint) - He indulged excessively in his early years, resulting in the complete loss of performance. In addition, he indulged in masturbation in his youth, so he often had spermatorrhea. Since he got married at the age of 25, he has been troubled by premature ejaculation and impotence almost every day. Although he had taken medicine to save himself, he could not be cured radically. He came for treatment this spring in March. (Symptoms at Diagnosis) - The gonads have lost their ability to exert sexual desire, frequent spermatorrhea, brain weakness, muscle wasting, everything has completely fallen into a state of extreme aging. (Treatment Method) - The doctor diagnosed that the source of Zhang's disease was due to the excessive damage to the gonads, resulting in the loss of performance. It is necessary to cultivate and consolidate his gonads, to supplement his endocrine, and to promote his metabolism. Therefore, he was given "Hemitol's Essence-Strengthening Pills" to stop spermatorrhea and consolidate the essence gate. At the same time, a large amount of the gonad hormone preparation "Gonadogen" was given to make the gonads turn from weak to strong, and the endocrine was abundant. After two months of treatment, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and impotence were completely cured. It has been five months now, and no recurrence has been seen.</p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I am 38 years old. My menstruation has never been accurate in the four years after marriage. It is either ahead or behind. Recently, my menstruation has stopped for two months. At the same time, I have a lot of leukorrhea. I am very worried. Fortunately, my husband asked me to buy and take "Female Gonadogen" to regulate my menstruation, and to use "Leukorrhea Cure" to treat the leukorrhea. After taking it, my menstruation came and the leukorrhea stopped. (Zhu Shouju)</p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Although I am very fond of decoration, the contours of my body lack natural beauty, which makes me feel very difficult, because I was born insufficient, and the so-called most important breast beauty is completely lost. The shriveledness is lamentable. Fortunately, I saw in the newspaper that "Female Gonadogen" has the function of strengthening and beautifying the breasts, so I took it for two months, and it was really effective. Now it is prominent and towering. (Feng Ying)</p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Please publish the course of my stomach pain in the newspaper, so that those with the same disease can have an effective mirror, so as to avoid endless pain. I not only had stomach pain attacks, but also had a poor appetite. I saw in the news that "Stomach Pain Cure" can stop stomach pain, and "Stomach Strengthening Pill" can help digestion. After taking it, the pain stopped and my stomach opened. It is truly worth a try. (Yu Ping)</p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>My father is weak and sick, so he usually takes tonics in the cold winter, and ginseng and bird's nest are continuous, but they are not very effective. Last winter, he changed his method and took the gonad hormone preparation "Gonadogen" to supplement it, and the effect was indeed outstanding. Because my father has always had symptoms such as fear of cold and back pain, he has not had any of them this year. At the same time, he is energetic and has the appearance of being strong when old. This is truly a holy product for nourishment. I am willing to introduce it, so that old age is worry-free. (Tang Ying)</p>
<p>Women's Beauty and Fertility</p>
<h3 id="e194">New Method for Seed of Youth <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine from the University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>...Healthy and beautiful women with prominent breasts are not easy to age</p>
<p>Whether the gonads are strong or not has a very important meaning for women. If they are strong, the development must be good, the buttocks are large, the curves are beautiful, the breasts are plump and towering, the spirit is lively, the skin is ruddy, wrinkles are not easy to appear, and although the age is old, they will not look old. And this kind of woman has accurate menstruation, lively eggs, and is easy to conceive.</p>
<p>On the contrary, weak gonads make development imperfect, and the buttocks and breasts are often as flat as a man's, without any beauty. And the body is weak, the spirit is always listless and lifeless, the skin is dry, and by the age of twenty-six or seven, there are already wrinkles, showing old age. Menstrual disorders, often leukorrhea, and it is not easy to conceive.</p>
<p>Aging is not beautiful, and the absence of offspring is not pleasant. Women must find ways to break this misfortune in order to seek the seeds of youth. The female gonad hormone preparation "Female Gonadogen" is their savior. This agent is made from the essence of the gonadal hormones of young female animals, which can make weak gonads become strong. Then the development restarts, the breasts rise up, the buttocks protrude, and the wrinkles become flat. Clearly, a dry, thin, and weak woman can be transformed into a healthy and beautiful modern woman in the shortest period of time.</p>
<p>Didn't I say that weak women often have leukorrhea? That cannot be ignored either. You should use "Leukorrhea Cure" as a suppository to remove it immediately; however, leukorrhea is often caused by contracting gonorrhea. If so, you must also take "Anti-Gonococcus," a combination preparation of flavin and Vaxin.</p>
<p>A Lesson From Weakness</p>
<h3 id="e195">Almost Destroyed My Happiness by Bone Pain <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— (Xu Guanyou)</p>
<p>A Letter Worth Reading</p>
<p>I have repeatedly wanted to pick up my pen to describe the beginning and end of my bone pain cure. I think this is somewhat beneficial to patients. But I am ignorant of literature, and I have repeatedly failed to muster my courage. Until now, a relative of mine, Mr. Shi, unfortunately also suffered from joint pain. After taking medicine through my introduction, he has now been completely cured. So this long-standing desire to express the truth has finally received victorious excitement, and I reluctantly wrote it.</p>
<p>It's ridiculous that I can't write well, so let's write from simple principles! At first, my bone pain symptoms were joint soreness, sometimes numbness and stiffness, which has been going on for six years. I am now less than forty years old. It is truly heartbreaking to have this disease at this age. In these six years, I have eaten all the bone pain pills, and they are always light and heavy, sometimes getting better and sometimes recurring. Until last winter, when I was having a severe attack, a relative of mine, Mr. Dong Zhiyuan, came to see me. He asked me if I had ever taken "Johnson's Bone Pain Pills"? I shook my head. He said, "Go and buy them quickly!" At the same time, he said: "It is indeed effective in dispelling wind, removing dampness, clearing blood, and preventing arteriosclerosis." Later, I took them, and the pain stopped immediately, my joints were relaxed, and my waist and back were comfortable. It's really strange. It has never recurred until now.

<h3 id="e196">The So-Called "Nation-Protecting Disaster-Relieving Dharma Assembly" <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Ji</p>
<p>After the alarming news of the Suiyuan border crisis arrived, calls for aid to Suiyuan resounded throughout the land. The inspiring and moving stories within this are simply too numerous to record. For example, the widowed woman of Cixi who emptied her family's coffers to alleviate the disaster is one example; the students of Beiping who, defying the municipal government's accusations of disrupting order, continued their aid Suiyuan movement, is another example; the elementary school students of Wuhu who, while raising funds for aid to Suiyuan, were inexplicably beaten severely, is yet another example; as for the common laborers and peddlers, who are usually looked down upon by the gentry, who were willing to go hungry and suffer more from the cold to save a few copper coins to express their heartfelt intentions, that is an even more widespread occurrence. The Chinese nation will never perish, and these instances not only give us a glimpse of hope but also provide us with a guarantee!</p>
<p>However, amidst the nationwide rise of calls to save the country, some gentry are playing the trick of the so-called "Nation-Protecting Disaster-Relieving Dharma Assembly." The "Nation-Protecting Disaster-Relieving Dharma Assembly" was initiated before the bandit-puppet regime invaded Suiyuan. At that time, the situation in Hebei and Chahar was very urgent, and "protecting the nation" was indeed a matter of utmost importance. As for "relieving disaster," although there was a harvest in various places this year, the malignant malaria around Gaoyou was extremely rampant, and whether the farmers could live and work in peace after the harvest was indeed quite questionable. At this time, holding a Dharma Assembly that both "protects the nation" and "relieves disaster" is naturally very timely.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is said that the good harvests in various places this year are due to the fact that a Bingzi Disaster-Relieving Dharma Assembly was held not long ago, which is why there is now an abundant harvest of crops. Abundant harvest is a fact; the so-called Bingzi Disaster-Relieving Dharma Assembly was indeed held not long ago; therefore, if the two are linked together as cause and effect, then one can only defer to that opinion. But it also makes us think of other things. If we were not as forgetful as those "lay Buddhists" and "Dharma Masters," I think we would definitely be able to remember. Let's take an example! For example, the Vajra Wheel Dharma Assembly, which was even more grand than the Bingzi Disaster-Relieving Dharma Assembly, and presided over by a Living Buddha, the magnificence of which has not yet been forgotten by us. However, this grand Dharma Assembly took place several years ago, and in these years, China is still facing a "serious national crisis." Not only "serious," but now it should be written that the national crisis is increasingly urgent.</p>
<p>But even though the "national crisis is increasingly urgent," the various Dharma Assemblies initiated by the gentry are endlessly emerging with ever-changing tricks. This time, the new banner being raised is called the "Nation-Protecting Disaster-Relieving Dharma Assembly," which happens to coincide with the bandit-puppet regime's invasion of Suiyuan, and thanks to the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers and the spiritual and material assistance of the people in the rear, a victory was won.</p>
<p>The victory and the "Nation-Protecting Disaster-Relieving Dharma Assembly" are linked together, and the "Nation-Protecting Disaster-Relieving Dharma Assembly" naturally has immense merit. But just as I was thinking this way, I saw a sketch about the assembly in a newspaper:</p>
<p>'...When they entered a room filled with many longevity tablets, the Dharma Master widened his Dharma eyes and stared intently at the tablets, chanting mantras. According to a monk from the temple, these longevity tablets are priced at two yuan and ten yuan each. People who spend money to buy these tablets can eliminate disasters and prolong their lives as long as the Dharma Master casts his Dharma eyes on their tablet...'</p>
<p>Only then did I suddenly realize that the so-called "Nation-Protecting Disaster-Relieving" is actually such a thing, and under such "protection" and "relief," the most important thing is still two yuan or even ten yuan. As for what is the difference between two yuan and ten yuan? Unfortunately, I am not a "Dharma Master" or "lay Buddhist," and the reporter did not write it out, so there is no way to know. But although the difference between two yuan and ten yuan is unknown, the benefits for the "Dharma Master" and the celebrities who initiated the assembly must be greater than this, I think that is certain. Otherwise, wouldn't the enthusiastic efforts be in vain? And wouldn't the frequent construction of Dharma altars be even more superfluous?</p>
<p>"Protecting the nation" is a good topic, and "relieving disaster" is also a good topic, as we struggle to survive under frequent disasters year after year. And to be able to eliminate disasters and prolong life by spending two yuan is an extremely cheap "good deed." It is no wonder that there are many believers when the Dharma Assembly is held. One can imagine the joyous faces of the initiating celebrities and the presiding Dharma Master when they see so many longevity tablets, that expression must be quite interesting. Don't say disappointing things when encountering successful people, I understand this worldly wisdom. At this time, if one were to talk about benefiting others and benefiting oneself, the small self and the great self, it would be too insensitive; since there is nothing to say, I might as well put down the pen here.</p>

<p>— Lu Zhi</p>
<p>As we walked towards the seaside, thick fog enveloped us. It was wet, salty, and like a fine drizzle. The fog rolled onto the embankment in gusts, coming from who knows where, and going to who knows where, a blanket of white. The sun was like a white porcelain lamp floating in the fog.</p>
<p>On the embankment, there was only Zheng Bao and I. We were both tired of walking. Along the way, we passed through many brine pits, salt-boiling sheds, and villages, encountering many little girls and children crossing the embankment, carrying bamboo strips to collect clams. After walking a long time, we turned a corner and finally arrived at Zheng Bao's relative's house.</p>
<p>As we entered the sparse village, several dogs surrounded us and barked. We knocked on the door for a long time, but only the dogs barked.</p>
<p>Zheng Bao, afraid that I would be anxious, said, "They won't be out this early." In fact, we were both tired of walking and wanted to rest. Since we couldn't find anyone, we were both a little annoyed.</p>
<p>"Oh, Zheng Bao, is that you... Get away, get away, kill you (speaking to the dogs). We thought it was someone else, you really scared us!" Two elderly men dressed as farmers came out from next door, one of whom said enthusiastically.</p>
<p>"Is this Xu Fuguan's house?" Zheng Bao asked urgently.</p>
<p>"He's not home!" The two men looked at me, filled with suspicion.</p>
<p>"This is my friend. Because he wants to visit Zhapu and see how salt is made, I came to find Fuguan with him."</p>
<p>The two men didn't reply, and quietly led us through the back door into the house. All the way, we chased away the dogs that were following us.</p>
<p>"Fuguan went out so early? Where's his mother? Where's his sister-in-law?" Zheng Bao asked.</p>
<p>"Ha... Ha... (bitterly laughed) They're boiling salt right now. They ran out of salt for cooking, and they wanted to take advantage of the heavy fog, so no one could see the smoke, to boil some for themselves. They usually don't dare to... I didn't expect you to come, wearing two coats. We thought you were salt inspectors. When they heard, they all ran away."</p>
<p>"Ran away?" We both unconsciously repeated.</p>
<p>"You sit for a while, we'll go find them."</p>

<p>Sitting in the room, which was both a kitchen and a living room, although the light was very dim, and the musty smell hit my nose in waves, I felt as settled as if I were at home. We both didn't say anything, looking at the unplastered walls, on which were two comical and rough paintings of "Fighting the Japanese." Beside the stove was a large bamboo cupboard, all dilapidated, as if it would break apart at the slightest touch. This family is still a good family, I really don't trust what Zheng Bao said.</p>
<p>Tired of sitting, we turned out the back door and walked closer to the bamboo garden. Suddenly, we saw smoke and steam rising over there. An iron pan, two feet square, was overturned on the ground. Under the pan was a square stove made of stones, and there was still a fire burning.</p>
<p>"This is the salt they're boiling!" I said, as if I had discovered a secret.</p>
<p>"How many pounds do you think they can boil here?" Zheng Bao asked me maturely.</p>
<p>"Two or three pounds!" I said.</p>
<p>At this moment, I heard hurried footsteps, and a thin man with a purplish face, nearly thirty years old, ran in.</p>
<p>"Oh, Brother Dou, what wind blew you here?... You scared me, it's really like 'you don't steal for a thousand days, but you get caught the moment you do'... Oh, this gentleman, please come in and sit, it's too dirty here."</p>
<p>We sat down, and he hurriedly fetched water, started the fire, and brewed tea for us to drink. "Did you come on the second bus? You should have come on the early bus, we wouldn't have been suspicious so early."</p>
<p>I felt sorry that I had caused this honest man such a scare. I was also curious as to why they were so afraid. "Can't you even boil this little bit to eat?"</p>
<p>"No, even half a catty will be fined three or four dollars! That's the rule." He said with a smile, revealing a mouthful of yellowed and uneven teeth. He was still panting.</p>
<p>"What if you can't pay the fine?" I asked, and then scolded myself for being too stupid.</p>
<p>"What else but getting beaten and going to jail." He sighed.</p>
<p>"Don't they boil salt now?" Zheng Bao asked. "He wanted to see how salt is boiled."</p>
<p>"Not allowed to boil it now, the public warehouse has too much salt stored. They're afraid of people boiling it privately."</p>
<p>The tea was brewed, like yellow mud, with a salty taste. Just as I was holding the teacup, two women stumbled in through the back door, one with bound feet only three inches long, and the other with large feet wearing cloth shoes, with mud splashing all the way up to their thighs. When they saw Zheng Bao, they forced a smile and said, "Bao, what wind blew you here? Look at your aunt and your sister-in-law, we've turned into two mud bodhisattvas... I fell three times."</p>
<p>The chair I was sitting on felt like it had thorns, and I couldn't settle down. I borrowed the excuse of going to Haiyan, and I pulled Zheng Bao away from this kind family. We didn't say a word on the way.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Old Theories and New Proofs of "Traitors" <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>The meaning of "traitor" is very clear, no need to elaborate, it is someone who betrays the country. However, in certain situations, there are also cases where, depending on the viewer, a traitor is seen as not a traitor, and a non-traitor is seen as a traitor. For example, going to Changchun or eastern Hebei to shout about saving the country will definitely be regarded as a "spy" without a doubt, and nothing but killing or arrest will do. This is clear proof. Thus, the meaning of "traitor" needs to be explained in more detail.</p>
<p>Flipping through my hand, I have a copy of the fourth issue of "Zhong Liu" magazine, which contains an article by Mr. Zheng Zhenduo called "Notes on Selected Texts." In his selection of late Qing dynasty texts, he discovered an article called "Distinguishing Traitors" by an unknown author, which was published in the late Qing dynasty secret revolutionary publication "Yellow Emperor's Soul." This provides a very detailed explanation of the definition of a traitor. In today's world where it is difficult to distinguish between black and white, re-publishing this article has great significance. Therefore, without avoiding repetition, I will transcribe it below:</p>
<p>The so-called true traitor is one who helps foreign races harm their own race. Guan Gan, who taught the Jin to advance; Zhang Tuo, who helped Shi Le destroy the Jin; Shi Jingtang, who served the Khitans as his father; Zhao Yanshou, who led dogs and sheep to slaughter their own kind; Zhang Hongfan, who helped the Yuan destroy the Song; Wu Sangui, Geng Jimao, and Shang Kexi, who helped the Qing destroy the Ming; Zeng Guofan, Zuo Zongtang, Li Hongzhang, and others, who helped the Manchus annihilate the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, are all today's dead traitors... As for what the Manchus called traitors, they were the great men and scholars of the Han race, who were willing to submit to foreign rulers for the sake of loving their own kind, even sacrificing themselves without hesitation, such as Huo Qubing and Wei Qing, who killed the Xiongnu during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han; Yue Fei of the Song Dynasty; Hong Xiuquan, the Taiping Heavenly King of modern times; and the martyrs Tang Caichang and Lin Shutang... We respectfully advise the Han people to be careful not to be traitors who harm themselves, but to be traitors who love themselves... Do not allow foreigners to call us traitors, and thus avoid the name of traitor and avoid it. Mr. Zheng noted: "At that time, Manchu officials often gave the title of traitor to revolutionaries, hence the author's explanation." This has made it very clear who the real traitors are, and what a traitor is. The standard for distinguishing is: Who leads dogs and sheep to slaughter their own kind, and who is willing to submit to foreign rulers and sacrifice themselves for the sake of loving their own kind?</p>
<p>The enemy comes with guns and cannons. Everyone can see it. The most terrible thing is: using your Han race to kill your Han race. In the enemy's secret plan, this is called "using Chinese to control Chinese." Aren't the so-called puppet troops who are causing chaos in eastern Suiyuan Chinese people? To expand on this, the enemy's visible and invisible hired executioners are currently numerous. They are killing with enthusiasm, and the enemy is watching from the sidelines and reaping the benefits. The grievances are soaring to the sky, and in the end, it is all their own people who are being killed. Mr. Zheng said in "Notes on Selected Texts," "Some of what they said is still useful today... Reading the articles full of anger and motivating national spirit that they published twenty or thirty years ago, I really can't help but feel that they are not outdated." I say, "It was like this in the past, and it is even more so today!"</p>
<p>I remember not long ago, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said in his speech at the Luoyang Military Branch School, "To revive the nation, we must first eliminate domestic traitors" (paraphrased). Therefore, I cite old theories to prove new events.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Candy <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Tianshe</p>
<p>Because of the constant pain from a few decayed teeth, I have finally become less fond of sweet things. Even the noble chocolates and fashionable spearmint gums have become mere toys to me. The brocade box with the seven-colored rubber stamp, the American pastoral scene seen through the cellophane on the box, a group of lively and innocent children chasing turkeys on a farm, a clothes rack in front of a clapboard house, a two-horse carriage in the distance, a middle-aged farmer smoking tobacco, and the sunshine on horseback... A rainbow-like, wheat-colored or lake-green ribbon diagonally crossed the picture, tightly tied in a bow on the corner of the brocade box. The simple color of the chocolate is pleasing to me.</p>
<p>This time, among the farewell gifts that Dai An gave me, there was such a box, "noble toy." Oh, a sorrow of the appetite quietly arises from within. There is some bitterness in the sweetness of the chocolate, is it the bitterness that can tempt my appetite, or is it the charred aroma that is tasted from the hidden? Over the years, the tempering of my heart and life has been stained with the color and taste of chocolate, a kind of ochre simplicity, a kind of bitter charred aroma, tightly making me linger, while the sweetness has finally become less appealing to me, this should be blamed on my past overeating of sugar, which ruined my teeth.</p>
<p>When I got home, I distributed the candy to the children, and only kept the brocade box for myself. However, when the children peeled open the shiny tin foil and saw the hard piece, they stared with their little round eyes in confusion; "What is this? There's no sesame and roses." Children living in the countryside have always been isolated from the material civilization of the city. What is considered a precious item in the city only earns a little doubt and contempt in the countryside. Just like wearing a suit to the countryside and being scolded as a monkey, even if my heart is filled with some indignation and grievances, I have to silently endure it. In the countryside, the status of sesame candy is much better than chocolate.</p>
<p>When the afternoon sun shines directly on the lonely courtyard, there will be a hoarse, seemingly laborious peddling sound, accompanied by the sound of iron pieces striking each other, unexpectedly breaking into the village lanes. It is very familiar, even for a traveler like me who rarely returns, I know that the old man selling sesame candy is here again. "Buy sesame candy, exchange rotten things for sesame candy, rose-salted sesame candy!" It lures some children out of the high and low doorways. The old man and his candy stall are surrounded in front of the ancestral hall's screen wall. He has a thin triangular face, moist eyes with fixed, dull pupils, a long neck, exposing two thick veins. When he raises his head and shouts, the thick veins turn purple, the purple of blood.</p>
<p>Sesame candies are stacked one by one in the tray, very neatly. The tray is placed on a bamboo basket, in which are randomly thrown some rags and rotten cotton. Most of his life is found in the wreckage. The remnants of life abandoned by others are becoming the only source of his life.</p>
<p>My little nephews pulled at the corner of my clothes, dragging me to the candy stall, pointing to the sesame candy in the tray. I had already discerned their little intentions. The old man smiled at me strangely, frequently throwing his hopeful gaze at me. I don't know how many years it has been since I traded with a candy vendor in my hometown, haven't eaten the crispy sesame candy of my hometown, haven't fooled around with many companions with the candy vendor. Although these situations are far apart in time, from the hazy memories, I seemed to return to my lost childhood. My teeth don't seem to be decayed, my third uncle, who often bought candy for me, is still healthy and alive, I can still distinguish the taste of salted caramel and roses, and I haven't forgotten the anger of my second brother always eating up his share first, and then coming to snatch mine.</p>
<p>But there is no me and my second brother in the current group of children. The spirit tablets of my third uncle have long been enshrined in the wooden niches of the ancestral hall. Many unfamiliar children's faces tell me; this is another generation's life. I stood in front of the candy stall, not knowing whether I was happy or sad? Even my own sense of self suddenly became blurred.</p>
<p>"Uncle, buy. Uncle, buy." The urging of my little nephews woke me up again. I took out copper coins from my pocket, bought a few sesame candies and distributed them. They scurried into the house, jumping and running. "Hehehe... Your husband really likes children." These unexpected words burst out from the old candy seller's dry throat. "Uh..." This nasal answer I suspected was not my own. I watched him put the heavy candy stall on his shoulder, hunching his back, walking step by step, and finally disappearing at the end of the lane, he was going to finish that unfinished road of life.</p>
<p>Returning to the house, I stared blankly at the chocolate brocade box on the table, and the decayed tooth was aching again...</p>

<p>Central and Western (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM - Opening "Flower Names"</p>
<p>Let the golden brazier burn sandalwood. A piece of jasmine to pray to the gods. I am originally, a peony with a delicate body, beautiful in the boudoir. Purple stems obstructed, lacking spirit. I haven't wanted camellia drinks for a long time. Helplessly swallowing opium instead. Cutting spring gauze curtains, long thinking of sleep. Tea rose fragrant dreams, carrying drowsiness. Lazy to apply hibiscus powder when dressing up. Heartlessly picking golden finches. Brocade mallow draped over the body, still feeling cold. Willow waist constantly tied with pomegranate skirts. Come evening, full of snow bananas, restless sleep. Cuckoo branches above, the moon is three watches. Eventually turned into, a tender begonia powerless and weary. Seeking, that seated lotus flower Guanyin. Protect my family, illness and suffering removed, adding lilies. Four seasons, lunar months, receding disasters. Spending the winter, exchanging for the new year. Reporting to the daylily, loving mother hears. Flowers are gold and silver, wishes fulfilled. The Buddha sees and smiles, achieving sincerity before the gods. Not learning from that, peach blossom lightly follows the flowing water. Wanting to cultivate the Tao, enjoying long-lasting spring. Although the ten sisters have completed their wedding candles. I am a pure orchid, unwilling to be stained with red dust. Wanting to know, the opening of the peony boasts wealth and nobility. Several times, butterfly dreams are unreal. What to say of the crape myrtle gentleman, handsome and gentle. What to say of the lotus flower, exquisite and graceful. Rely on you, magnolia and golden phoenix guests. All are people from the reed flower gathering. Pear vine entanglements are also empty names.</p>

<p>Yuan Chang (1120) 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Common Sayings Song" (Mimi Collection Launch Issue)</p>
<p>Strange and funny jokes are new. Talking nonsense to deceive you all. The world is changing with fancy tricks. Grumbling and sighing about suffering. Confused and muddled, truly freehand. Dizzy and messed up, blindly enthusiastic. Adults and big shots have bad consciences. Pretending to be foolish and deceiving people. Wine, sex, wealth, and qi are four characters. Welcomed by thiefs and dogs. High profits and ample family property. Having wealth and power, but shouldn't. Resentment soaring to the sky, poor people suffer. How can they freely make a living. Pitiable dwarves eat farts, who pities them. Fierce and evil people fight for power. The most laughable thing is that teenage girls sell their charms. Fascinated eyes laugh, not good. Tousled hair, pretending to be fashionable. Chest out, belly protruding, dressed up new. Red lips and white teeth, full of prestige. It's a pity that her feet are small, and it's difficult to walk. Oily black dripping water clear silk hair. Fine skin and white flesh, all worthy of swallowing. A harmonious fat man is short. Like the land goddess of the previous life. Card tricks are good. Pulling and dragging, talking about love. Banging tables and benches, gambling money. Shouting and hollering, noisy and full. Hands sore, feet soft, truly suffering. Shaking heads and wagging tails, what's the point. Later, transplanting flowers and grafting trees breaks. Scolding daughters-in-law while borrowing children, what's the point of making things difficult. Zhang San and Li Si randomly mess around. Wine and meat friends lack mediation. Sharp-headed tricks want to scam. Five ghosts and seven evil spirits scold the door. I advise you all to live a proper life.</p>
<p>Jiang Binchu's "Three Smiles"</p>
<p>New Sound (1380) 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Traces of Flowers and Moon"</p>
<p>Unparalleled strange book, Traces of Flowers and Moon. The karma of love is talked about. In the Autumn Heart Courtyard, people are like jade. At the Spring Mirror Tower, guests are distraught. Dreaming of double mandarin ducks, hearts are at odds. Ten years of wandering, trapped in the wind and dust. Talented people falling on hard times is common. Wasting a dignified seven-foot body. Don't laugh at the foolish Zhu being poor and desperate. The talented and extraordinary woman has autumn traces. Why meet if you don't know each other. All are fallen people at the end of the world. Cleaning up the beautiful fate, returning to the land of hatred. Using one death to repay the special grace. Caiqiu is also a courtesan girl. Poetry and prose, a hundred things are capable. The figure is charming and the person is beautiful. A pair of giant eyes recognize the scholar. From ancient times, beauty is born. Killing two birds with one stone, good things are accomplished. Wealth and poverty are not worth mentioning. Don't lightly discuss glory and distress. Tang Qu's tears and Feng Tang's old age. Awe-inspiring spirit, but in vain, the ambition is not extended. Winning a thousand years of good reputation. Honored after one's death, even as a commoner. Leisurely talking about the hatred in my heart. Regardless of whether the sky falls or the earth darkens. Holding the pipa, the flowers and moon faintly leave traces.</p>

<p>The radio play "Heroic Woman of a Lonely City" is a collaboration between Zhonghua Tong, recording by Jin Xiangjiu, photography by Chen Chen, set design by Zhang Hanchen, and starring Chen Yanyan, Zheng Junli, and Shang Kouwu.</p>
<p>The entire film "Song of a慈母曲" has been completed, and the results are excellent. However, in order to expand the promotion of this film, although it has been decided to premiere at the Jincheng Theater, the screening date has not yet been easily determined.</p>
<p>Sun Yu's new work "Spring Comes to the World" features a scene of Peach Leaf Bridge, built in the south of the main factory. The water meanders, and the bridge spans both banks. The scenery is entirely in the Suzhou style. If a few soft Wu dialect sounds are added, floating in between, it would be truly like being on the side of Wu Wang Terrace.</p>
<p>The prison scene in "General's Daughter" is grand and gloomy, worthy of being called a masterpiece. It can be compared to foreign films and is designed by the set designer Xu Ke.</p>
<p>Zheng Junli plays Zhang Zhengke, a calm and rational revolutionary in "Heroic Woman of a Lonely City." He is calm and capable, just like his character. His "engaged" but not "married" wife Chen Yanyan is a modest young woman who makes a living by selling pearl rice.</p>
<p>Li Zhuozhuo plays the general's daughter in He Mengfu's "General's Daughter." She is insightful and firmly believes in the Three Principles of the People. She does not condone her father's actions, accepts the party's orders, and puts righteousness before family, acting very movingly.</p>
<p>Han Langan, who had been wandering for many years, suddenly appeared wearing a top hat and a tuxedo, holding a "stick," strutting around. It turned out that he had been re-employed by the factory owner Liu Jiqun as a representative for escorting automobiles. On the day of Han Langan's wedding, the gift from factory owner Liu was a red silk congratulatory banner with the four characters "A Match Made in Heaven" affixed to it. (In Shen Fu's film "A Match Made in Heaven.")</p>
<h3 id="e207">Shirley Temple's New Film "Dimples" <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Premiering today at the Grand Cathay simultaneously</p>
<p>"Dimples," produced by 20th Century Fox, is Shirley Temple's latest masterpiece. The film tells the story of an orphan with no parents who relies on her unambitious grandfather to eke out a living. Although this grandfather loves his granddaughter very much, he himself is prone to random talking and meddling. Although Shirley tries to persuade him, it's no use, but Shirley's enthusiasm for her grandfather never wanes. Later, although a wealthy woman offers her grandfather thousands of dollars to take Shirley in, Shirley ultimately stops because she can't bear to leave her grandfather. Later, her talent for acting is discovered by a playwright, and she begins a stage life. On the day she goes on stage, her grandfather is about to be arrested because of a past act of deception, but as a result, the plaintiff is moved by her sincere performance and abandons everything. In this film, not only is Shirley's performance skillful, but Frank Morgan, who plays the old grandfather, also has amazing gains. Premieres simultaneously at the Grand Cathay theaters.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Two Songs from "Little Orphan Girl" <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Xinhua Company's exquisite work "Little Orphan Girl," following "Night of Joy," has been completed and will be screened at the Jincheng Theater after "Life and Death Together." This film is the first starring role for child star Chen Juanjuan, with surprisingly mature acting skills. There are two songs in the film, sung by Chen Juanjuan, which are exceptionally melodious. The lyrics are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Little Orphan Girl</p>
<p>(1) The dog barks woof woof, a peaceful home is in turmoil, in turmoil, disasters and war are as fierce as fire.</p>
<p>(2) The sparrow chirps chirp chirp, parents and siblings are separated by life and death, life and death are imminent, the orphan wanders for thousands of miles.</p>
<p>(3) The cat meows mimi, the orphan can't bear the hunger in her belly, the hunger in her belly, no one cares about three meals a day.</p>
<p>(4) The crow caws gua gua, the orphan is desolate and has no home to return to, no home to return to, spending the long night on the windy and rainy streets.</p>
<p>Sit in a Circle</p>
<p>(1) Sit in a circle, eat fruit, everyone listen to me, get up early when the day breaks, learn gymnastics, be healthy, eat your fill, work hard, although people are small, aspirations are high, don't make people laugh, haha ​​hee hee, hee hee haha, we are all great old men.</p>
<p>(2) Sit in a circle, eat fruit, everyone listen to me again, go to bed early when the day is over, cultivate energy, don't be lazy, dad farms the fields, brother does the work, although people are small, there is a lot of strength, don't miss the time, haha ​​hee hee, hee hee haha, we are all old brothers.</p>
<p>It is heard that the company has now printed exquisite sheet music. To request it, write directly to the Propaganda Department of the company at 433 Edward Road, and it will be sent immediately.</p>
