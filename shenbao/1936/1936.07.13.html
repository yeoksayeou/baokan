<h3 id="c41">公共租界工廠檢查問題 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>國家制定工廠法的目的。直接是在改良工人待遇。减少勞資糾紛。間接是在策進工業安全。發展國民經濟。這種工業行政上不可或缺的法典。很有重大的意義。可是祗有工廠法而不施行工廠檢查。以考核工廠法實施的程度和範圍。那麽工廠法的立法目的。也是不能貫澈的。所以各國都在頒佈工廠法之後。跟着頒佈工廠檢查法。來樹立工廠檢查制度。我國的工廠檢查法。是民國二十年一月十日所頒佈。於同年十月一日施行的。到現在依法施行工廠檢查的已有二十餘省市。可是全國工廠最多的上海租界區域。還不見實施。這實在是一種遺憾。</p>
<p>在工廠檢查法施行以前。我國實業部會經邀請了國際勞工局專家彭恩和安德生二人來華協助。和上海租界當局會商工廠檢查的辦法。民國二十年十一月。實業部又延請上海市政府及公共租界和法租界工部局代表。作非正式會議。繼續恊商。當時决定了二項原則。（一）上海各工業區域。祗應有一種勞工法規。（二）這種法規的實施。應由檢查人員執行。行動須一律。不得彼此參差。不久。又舉行第三次非正式會議。决定了三項原則。（一）上海公共租界和法租界當局。允任用中國政府所訓練並舉薦的工廠檢查員。以檢查各該界內所有的工廠。此項檢查員。由中央檢查所的檢查員。隨時加以督察。（二）公共租界和法租界的工廠檢查員。應把檢查的結果和困難。按期報告中國政府和公共租界及法租界當局。（三）上海公共租界和法租界內的工廠檢查員。應按月舉行會議一次。交換意見。並就所應補救的事情。協商辦法。可是公共租界的董事會郤以為這二次决議並未經正式認可。特地召集了一次納稅人特別大會。要修改洋涇浜地皮章程附欵第三十四條。取得飭令工廠領照的必要權力。然後在界內設立檢查機關。施行一種一律適用於中外工廠的工業法規。姑不論納稅人特別大會。根本沒有權力修改洋涇浜地皮章程及其附欵。就算他們眞有權力來變更租界的本質吧。那麼這種辦法。不但可使僑華外人。利用我國法權尙未完全收回的時機。適用其本國的法律。還可使居住於本國領土的外人居留地的國人也不能適用本國的法律。豈不是對於我國的立法權的重大的蔑視。因此市政府當局提出了抗議。市民團體也羣起反對。租界當局便因這種反饗將原案作罷了。此後中央雖有兩次派遣代表。向前兩屆國際勞工大會提出。請求國際勞工局恊助。轉請各國政府代表疏通。可是仍然沒有若何效果。是近上海市政府和公共租界當局又磋商了幾次。始於上月二十五日成立協定草案九條。恊定內容。包含着四個要點。（一）由我國授權工部局。在租界內設立工廠檢查處。實施工廠檢查。（二）檢查員由中國當局與工部局各派半數。（三）遇有違背法令的案件。須執行中國工廠法時。應向法院提起控訴。（四）工部局要向中國當局繕具報告。從這四個要點看來。租界工廠的檢查權。名義上仍為我國所有。而租界檢查工廠也得根據着我國工廠法實施。而在實際的權限上我方則已作了很大的讓步。不料這項協定。在最近的領事團會議。竟又發生了波折。領團方面要求着縮小恊定的適用範圍。要使有領判權各國的工廠免除檢查的手續。這實在是對於工廠檢查問題的重大的打擊。因為工廠檢查的主要意義。是在保護勞工。而上海外國工廠的工人。全是中國人。尤其有受政府保護的必要。如果工廠檢查把外國工廠除外。那麽。這種設施不但收不了多大的效果。還會使華商工廠在對外廠的競爭上。更陷於不利的地位。所以外國工廠同受檢查這一點。在我方是非力爭不可的。然而各國正堅持着以往的不平等條約。如果民族主義的外交沒有什麽新開展。這個較小的公共租界工廠檢查問題恐怕很不容易澈底解决吧。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　胡仲持　胡一臧</p>
<p>不久以前，我們費了五十多天的工夫，到日本去旅行了一次。除了遊覽名勝之外，我們訪問過不少行政上產業上和文化上的公私機關，參觀過幾個盛大的博覽會。我們又訪問通我國駐日的大使館領事館，就僑胞的生活調查了一番。我們到處承受着日本友人的誠摯的招待，在幾個大都市還蒙我國使領和留日友人關切得同一家人一般。這些身受着的熱情是我們永遠忘不掉的。</p>
<p>在這次旅行中，我們欣賞着明媚的島國風景，燦爛的大和藝術；驚歎着壯麗的都市建設，發皇的產業文明；欽佩着勤勉的國民精神，整齊的政治秩序。同時我們也同情着農工生活的苦惱，悲嘆着少數的野心家把戰爭的種子散播到愛好和平的民衆心頭。那些野心家一面鼓吹着戰爭思想，一面把全國大部分的生產力統制起來，大量製造着殺人的利器——坦克，大砲，兵艦，潛艇，搶械，子彈以至於化學兵器毒瓦斯之類，為的是要使他們的帝國獨占東亞，稱覇世界。</p>
<p>在今日國際的形勢之下，這種企圖顯然是不能實現的迷夢。可是這個迷夢不但使他們國內多數的民衆平白地犧牲着福利，還使我們民族受到了莫大的苦難。我們中國人為自己的民族着想，也為「友邦」多數的民衆着想，非大家齋心一致，用團結的力量，來喚醒那些野心家的迷夢不可。首先第一，我們應該擺脫無謂的對於「強鄰」的恐懼心理，激發起民族的自信力來。歷史的事實敎訓着我們民族：「我們不必害怕鄰國，我們也不該害怕鄰國。」我們經過了這次實際的觀察，愈加覺得上述那一個信念是不可動搖的。</p>
<p>現在我們把這次旅行中所得到的種種印象，依照我們的行程寫記下來，希望這麽蕪雜的材料多少可以帮助些國人對於日本的瞭解。</p>
<p>一·警探綱和關稅壁壘</p>
<p>早晨的太陽剛才照射到日本郵船會社的匯山碼頭上，我們携帶着簡單的行李，坐車到那里，要趁上午九點鐘開的「長崎丸」。</p>
<p>一到碼頭，「紅帽子」就把我們的幾隻皮箱搬上船，我們要跟着上去，郤給站在步梯口的一個中國巡捕攔住了。他指着旁邊木牌上的文字，對我們說，「請等到八點半光景，在碼頭上掉換了船票再上去」我們沒奈何，只好站在那里呆等着。後來碼頭上已經擠滿了人了，才有船公司的四個辦事員在兩張小桌邊坐下來，給旅客二一的掉票。我們兩人塡好了項目繁多的旅客登記表，掉好了船票，上船，離開船時刻不到十五分鐘了。我們在中國社會裏一向過的是從容的馬虎的生活，初次接觸到日本交通組織上那麽一種講求時間經濟的整齊嚴密的精神，委實覺得有些不對勁。</p>
<p>上船以後，心頭本該可以寬鬆些了吧。然而日本帝國政府密布到自國的商船上的警探網却使我們還舒暢不得。我們兩人在船上先後經過了四個便衣警探嚴密的查問。他們不但間明了我們的年齡，籍貫，住所以及這次旅行的路綫，還根究了我們何年何月在什麽學校畢業，到日本那些地點去有什麽目的。他們在大疊的紙張上把我們所回答的話全都記下來。我們要證明自己的話拿出隨帶着的各種介紹信給他們看，那知他們竟不怕麻煩，把那些極平常的償也都抄了去。我們是中國新聞記者，要到日本全國去遊歷難怪他們特別的注意。可是同船上有許多普通的日本商人也個個都給他們仔細盤問過。我們親見一個日本的製菜商人，不但受了長時間的查問，甚至他拿出來證明他的正當職業的一本製菓講習會的聽講錄也給警探從頭到尾地抄在紙上，足足抄了大半個鐘頭。這樣的澈底精神與其說是日本警探制度上一種值得贊佩的特色，不如說是日本內部潛在的不安狀態的反映。的確，我們聽得日本警探制度儘管那麽周密，國內還是有很多的共產黨秘密地活動着。東京有些公共機關里時常發現着赤色的宣傳品，警探用盡了全力，還是查究不出那宣傳品的來源來。</p>
<p>長崎丸的頭等艙有許多房間是留給查問旅客的公務員住的。這些公務員除了軍警方面以外，還有日本海關的巡查員和檢疫官。日本關稅壁壘的森嚴，我們在船上也感覺得到。船上貼有「旅客注意」的通告，說是每一旅客上岸時，携帶香烟過了一百枝，携帶雪茄烟過了五十枝就得照漏稅條例受罰辦。船還未進日本海船上的「給仕」（茶役）就拿兩張表格來，呌我們塡寫，一張是旅客自用烟草報告表，還有一張是旅客携帶物品報告表。我們帶有新買的小照相機一架，因為聽「給仕「說，到海關時難免惹麻煩，只得把照相機上的漆刮去了些，在外面的皮袋上寫了名字，弄成用舊的照相機一樣。我們又帶有橘子兩小簍，是親戚送給我們的。聽說橘子之類的水菓一只也不能帶上岸去，我們終於只得把吃剩的大半簍橘子全都丟棄在船上。</p>
<p>長崎丸駛行了一畫夜，把我們帶到了日本的國境。從甲板上望去，九州沿海星羅桃布的島嶼所構成的海景是非常美麗的。可是一看到船上貼着的長崎要塞司令部的公告，我們却起了另一種的感覺。那公告上畫着要塞地帶的略圖，警告旅客不得在這地帶以內攝影，構圖或是記錄。我們知道我們已經進到戒備森嚴的日本軍事區域了。</p>

<p>小巴黎人報駐羅馬訪員來電稱、「據聞意相墨索里尼擬乘機提出歐洲新公約計劃、此項公約非復前此之四强公約、乃將蘇俄波蘭包括在內、而成為六國公約、」本業報名記者塔布衣夫人則謂、「德國雖不致使用武力侵入奧國、但在實際上、德國勢力自必徐徐侵入、至以各大國而論、此種協定所可引起之後果、較之奧國哈布斯堡舊皇室復辟或德國使用武力實行德奧合併、允勝一籌、要之、德奧兩國頃所成立之協定、實乃一種同盟條約、歐洲各國因其為害較輕、自必加以接受、但奧國業已成為德國之一部份、亦必知之而不為所朦混也、」社會黨機關報人民報載稱、「德奧兩國協定、驟視之、原屬無可疵議、而夷考其實、則某某國對於國聯會與集體安全機構第一次總攻擊、業已見其端倪、此在意國自必樂於參加」云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>華聯社特稿　日本駐華大使川越茂來華不到一月、他對於中日問題的懷抱、曾經發表過數决談話、大意是說要調整中日關係、應先由經濟提携入手、首先是對日「滿」間特殊地帶的華北、實行日本的經濟援助、投資華北鐵道·實行農村的提携與指導·調查開發鑛山等、表面上看來、這種外交方針似乎要比較「帶用拳頭的爆彈外交」來得緩和些、但實質上確是繼着增兵以後與增兵政策相配合、進而併吞整個華北的最狠毒的計劃、因為日本對華北的經濟政策、是以傾注全力準備大戰為骨幹、這種政策的內容、是（一）攫取軍事原料富源、（二）使現有鐵道公路置於日人支配之下、準備當戰事爆發之時、可以轉變為軍用路綫、（三）建設具有軍事意義的道路、川越的外交懷抱、恰好和這內容相符合、誰說學是日本侵略中國緩和的象徵呢、現在我們試分別舉出具體的事實來、更進二步揭破所謂經濟提携的作用、第一、我們先說鐵路問題、目前在日人計劃之中進行最積極的、要算是興築滄石鐵道了、這條鐵路一旦完成之後、重大的作用有三、（一）可以使山西的媒產直接由當地運至天津或靑島、（二）可以便利開採沿綫資源、（三）可以資為由靑島運兵入山西綏遠之用、其决計劃中的、是延長平綏綫、使與由張北經多倫而達偽熱河省的赤峰、不消說這一項計劃、更擁有重大的軍事意義的、因為他可以由此獲得了運輸軍需進攻外蒙的又一捷徑、此外如北寗路及平綏路、因與日本有直接或間接的關係、所以實際上也都已經被它支配着了、再則是援助農村復興問題、其主要點係在於獎勵種植棉花、因日本是經工業國家、棉花是紡織工業的主要原料、但日本對此則非常缺乏，歷來均由印度及美洲輸入、若一旦對英對美發生衝突、此項重要的來源卽有被人截斷、使紡織產業根本陷於破產之虞、因此軍部和資本家乃以華北作為產棉尾閭的目標、同時又計劃設立自然研究所等、以改良棉產、使更適合大阪舫織工業資本家的需要、但日本援助幷獎勵華北農民種植棉花的目的、尙不止此、因為他的援助獎勵、將使中國棉產資源歸其掌握、結果「風前殘燭」般的中國紡織業、自難更要逢到更嚴重的難關了、第三、是開發鑛產問題、據調查華北之媒的蘊藏、佔全中國總埋藏量百分之八十、其中僅山西一省、便達一千二百七十萬噸之多、而且在這一千二百餘萬噸之中、有三百六十四萬噸是無烟煤、這是日本普通產業及軍事工業上所最需要的原料之一、自然是垂涎欲滴、不肯放鬆的、同時他還有一種計劃、卽企圖把英國的開澳煤鑛、也收入自己手中、他一方面用撫順會社的出品、打出開麋公司在華北的銷塲、同時又散佈許多空氣、必使開澳讓與日本、此外尙有一點、卽對於中國媒礦企業的攫取、現在臨源柳江等公司都已被他掠奪去了、說到鐵、據調查全中國的蘊藏量、共為二億三千六百八十五萬四千噸、而察哈爾的宣化一地、便佔百分之三十九、除宣化以外、在河北省內尙有三千二百四十二萬四千噸、山東省有一千三百七十萬噸、日本每年需鐵大約要在二百五十萬噸至三百萬噸之間、其中大半是仰給於外國、因此對於軍事政治支配下的華北各省鐵鑛、那有不想染指的道理呢、這些事實、還不足說明川越所倡的經濟外交的眞面目嗎、我們在上面已經說這種經濟外交、是與增兵政策相配合、進而併吞整個華北之目的、是在於經濟、而這種經濟的目的、也推銷商品掠奪原料之外、還有準備作戰的作用、增兵便是為的掩護、這種目的的推行、川越在軍部支持之下、於增兵聲中來華履新、其所謂經濟提携中所包含的嚴重性、是很顯然的、「政治是經濟的集中表現」我們相信除了別有居心者外、誰都明白所謂經濟提携、是要使華北淪於完全殖民的地位、</p>

<p>後勞方君領導、去參觀嬰兒臥室、每室設數木床、每床同臥三四小孩、十有七八都是頭大　細、哭起來有氣無聲的、床上鋪着的夏席、已多被尿汚浸成黑褐色、室裏蒸發着又臭又霉的怪味、恐怕就是那些死亡嬰孩的緩性毒瓦斯、又「營養不足、」自然更要算他鬥致命的主兇、還有因病睡在病室裏的、據說那天是星期、沒有醫師照料、僅有幾個綠頭蒼蠅、突然嗡嗡地飛起來、在方君陳述「送在病室裏的、大槪只在早晚間……」的語聲中，我便趕緊走開、</p>
<p>方君服務該所　約二十年、據稱所得嬰孩死亡率、占百分之七十、養大的祇占百分之二三十、而且速抱養去的計人、來源大多數為「父母貧窮、」與「輕女之風」所遺棄、故所收女嬰、占百分之九十以上、偶得一二男孩、卽易被人抱去、抱養女嬰者、多數是畬民、而且還酌贈捐欵、因為彼挨沒有重男輕女之風、蕭伯納前參觀某國的育嬰所、他曾大概這樣的說過、應該使他們（嬰孩）極快樂的飽餐一頓、然後於甜夢中、把他們燒死、——因為這社會、不是他們所有的、蕭氏此言、雖跡近殘忍、但以金華育嬰所死亡率證之、可知蕭氏正是替這些無數不幸的小生命、揭穿舊社會在假面具下的殘酷行為、也好讓眞慈善家從根本上早想辦法、</p>

<p>本報特寫　一位新近從北平來滬的朋友說，有一次他問剛從上海玩了回去的某女士道：</p>
<p>「您這一次從上海來，可能吿訴我上海究竟有些什麼呢？」</p>
<p>「唔，上海麽？」那位女士顯然現着失望的樣子回答說着，「我倒看不出有什麼新鮮的玩意兒，就祗覺得那里儘是房子。房子外面是馬路，馬路上儘是人！」</p>
<p>的確，就是在上海住慣了的，也有這種感想，每天一睜開眼，身子在房子裏，房子裏早也就有和自己同一戚想的許多人，從家裏或辦公室跑上馬路，那街道上又是些人，而且比屋子裏還要多，重復回到房子裏，再碰到的又是些人。上海的地狹，屋小，人衆，被這位北平女士形容刻劃得儘够了。</p>
<p>在夏天，這上海的三部相——地狹，屋小，人衆——除了極少數的享受階級者外，格外的呌人覺得悚然。於是在室內溫熱高到九十六度的某午，偕着這里開頭所引的那位北平來的朋友，冒暑到高橋海濱浴塲去。</p>
<p>我們已經在渡輪上了，黃浦江裏的水，混濁得像流動的水門汀。太陽，正午直射，屛着氣一絲不動而悶晒的太陽，蒸騰得這江水在一片片翻動着的浪花上，散出像熱油鍋裏鑽出來的一股氣味。我們先在房艙裏坐了一會，覺得背上的汗已由濕透而淋漓了，於是卸了長衣，手執輕扇，——其實我那朋友手裏拿着的一柄扇子，的摸有一尺二三寸長，是扇骨上刻有御製詩的宮扇。踱出房艙，在甲板上揀了兩張帆布椅子，面朝着船頭坐了。一位兒船上打着鐘，船身慢慢地離開碼頭，岸上的嘈雜聲音，漸漸地遠了，終至於辨別不出黃包車上所坐着的是男還是女，這渡船已經駛向江心朝北進發了。</p>
<p>一陣陣地江風，雖然有些像從廚房間裏或浴室中吹出來的，經不起接連的緊吹着，汗漬的人背和帆布的椅背，已經不發生瓜葛了。我那朋友手中的大扇子，也已經把扇頁收折攏來，拿在手裏。輕輕地敲擊着自己的大腿股和手掌心，在這樣大熱的午天，竟有像「風淸月白」之夜的閒適態度，恐怕在裝有冷氣的屋子裏，也找不出這種人罷。</p>
<p>近看四週有十來隻帆布椅，有幾個外國人坐在那裏，指着兩岸，有一搭沒一搭的在談天，風從一位西洋太太的頭上吹過，金絲髮倒掛着在黑而圓的遮陽眼鏡旁，她舉手朝鬢邊掠上一掠，昂着　子乘勢的將頭頸搖伸了一搖。我們再朝着那幾隻空着的帆布椅上打量了一下，將頭靠向後面，儘量地閒閒地歇息了一會子。</p>
<p>江中停靠者許多外洋來的裝貨輪船，鶴喙式的起重機上，吊着一梱梱的貨物，有的在卸，有的在裝。小工們在大陽底下，赤露着醬色的上體，塗上一層油亮亮的汗汁，在那裏忙着工作，我們的渡輪在船體旁掠過，祇聽得一陣陣地汽機開着起重機的轆轆聲音，忽近忽遠，忽續忽斷，已經有好幾條犬貨船在我們旁邊經過了。</p>
<p>經過西渡，東溝，慶寗寺，……渡輪在轉灣停靠，倒車，順車中忙着。忽地我那朋友指着船尾後，正在趕着前進的一艘白色巨輪，呌我看那船首龍骨旁的船名，霎時問兩船已相並而行了，那船看上去有兩萬噸左右，統體白色，靠水面是綠色，白的浪花分向左右兩舷劈開，那種四平八穩，昻然自若的雄姿，大有君臨浦江，盼　自豪的氣概。我細看那船首上，知道這船名為　Filex　Roussel是一條法國郵船，那朋友本來是久居歐洲，老於出門的，他道你不要單羨慕她現在江面上的平穩安閒，一到印度洋裏，遇到天氣惡劣的節季，就要顚簸如箕了，而况一到地中海，那悶熱的難受，遠不及我們在這隻渡輪上臨風舒適呢！</p>
<p>船到高橋，上了公共汽車，不到二十分鐘便到了海濱浴塲，我是舊地重遊。對於那里的大概情形，早已胸有成竹。我那朋友，却是初次蒞止，東張西望的當中，未免顧此失彼。據事後他吿訴我，他初以為這個海濱浴塲，一定是落着上海人的俗語呌做「噱頭勢」而已，那知道，那里竟有一個沙灘，雖比不上靑島大連的氣派，比了水門汀砌的游泳池眞要高明多多了。而且還有一個大餐堂，小花園，草廳，蒙古包，可以游泳，垂釣，燕息，……他最後的一結，便是「頑頭倒不小哩」！他無疑的在滿意當中，就把他的個性流露出來了。</p>
<p>我們先在灘邊的草廳中略坐了一會，呷了些冰水，海的氛圍籠罩了我們全身，又有一陣陣地海風接連着向身上襲擊，禁不得這樣的內應外合，一腔煩熱，早已化歸烏有。我那朋友，更去租了一套游泳衣，着實道地的淴了個海水浴。我一個子沿着灘邊跑了一會，看看北面一帶儘是藍白色綫條組成的蓬幕，再高些的岸地上，一排又是幾十間小屋子，綠紗的窗門，面前種了些雜樹，前面臨海，後面盡是田野蔬園，我私地裏自忖，在這樣赤日當空的炎暑底下，見了這種景色，已經大有凉意，要是眞能在這里住上一兩宵，在黑沉沉的夜裏臥聽那海裏的潮音，加上大量的凉風，遠遠地再送來幾聲夜航的汽笛，怕木要蓋上薄棉被麼？想到這裏，不禁心理上起了個寒噤，便又折回來，走過淋浴的噴水泉旁，看見有四個身裁相仿的靑年姑娘，正在一字兒排着等待攝入鏡箱，那呼笑的聲音，打破了我的「凉意」。我想還是去看看我的朋友罷，於是向灘邊走去，那里的風眞大的可愛，從我的袖口，褲管裏吹進去，頓時我澎漲而變為肥碩了。這時正走過出租游泳玩具的小亭子，那里掛着幾個空心的橡皮人，那種「虛有其表」的樣子，和我被風吹大着的衣服殼子，有些相仿，我正暗地裏要噗赤笑出來的當兒，我那朋友把頭浮在水面上，提高着嗓子喊道。</p>
<p>「喂，老兄，在那裏出神着做什麽？還是下水來浸浸罷！」</p>
<p>「很够了」我也高着喉嚨回答着，「這里還不錯罷」</p>
<p>我那朋友的嘴裏，剛吐出「有意思」三個字來，一個浪花捲來，他又鼓動着手脚動起來了。</p>
<p>直到六點鐘我們纔離開海濱，臨別的時候，我對那朋友道：</p>
<p>「下决貴友某女士再到上海來的話，何不請她到高橋去走上遭呢？（EL）</p>

<p>大德成勝晨光十五比零（晨光棄權）</p>
<p>晨光昨戰將稀少、不能成軍、雖曾賽第二單打及第一雙打、但按照盃賽規則第八條「至少須有四組出塲比賽、否則槪作棄權論」辦理、不能成一全局、故作棄權視之、再規定棄權二次、卽取消其比賽資格、希望晨光特別注意、</p>
<p>又據陸君云、昨報所載嶺南勝零星之比賽、零星趙子謙君謂有隊員多名參戰華成盃、要求嶺南展期不成、應作棄權論、初未正式作戰成績云云、並非確詞、又夏邨陳百年君則謂與梅廬比賽之第二雙打中、其名為吳養吾之誤、</p>

<p>— 魏友棐</p>
<p>二十五年度的總槪算，由主計處在五月中旬編成，於六月中旬送中政會通過。復由行政院根據總槪算編成總預算，於六月三十日經立法院通過，正式公布了。這一次預算數字，比主計處擬定的總槪算案，在總額上約减少二千萬元。據行政院提交立法院的咨文中說及，原定歲出入十萬萬餘元，表而上雖若收支適合，而歲入部份，由主計處酌擬增列者，計有債欵收入一萬八千萬元，國有營業純益收入一千萬元，統稅一千二百萬元，實際相差在二萬萬元以上。為謀收支平衡及鞏固法幣信用計，所以審查上根據（一）經常費照上年度核定預算數，一律不加：（二）新增機關非必要者緩設；（三）臨時費非必要者不列。三項原則把歲出加以减削，因此總額為九萬九千〇六十五萬八千四百五十元。</p>
<p>根據此次立法院公布的二十五年度預算，經臨合計，比二十四年度略有膨脹，計增加三千萬元。而各項歲出與歲入細目，則有增有减，其中增减數額較鉅者如次：（單位千元）</p>
<p>歲入項下</p>
<p>統稅　增　一八、二五四</p>
<p>債欵　增　五五、〇〇〇</p>
<p>關稅　减　二三、四二四</p>
<p>烟酒稅　减　四、七八一</p>
<p>國有收入减　三、〇六七</p>
<p>其他　减　一三、五八八</p>
<p>歲出項下</p>
<p>國務費　增　二、四一〇</p>
<p>內務費　增　四、二三二</p>
<p>敎育文化費　增　六、八三六</p>
<p>建設費　增　一六、七一九</p>
<p>國有營業資本　增　五三、三六七</p>
<p>黨務費　减　二、四五二</p>
<p>財務費　减　五、九一一</p>
<p>債務費　减　三五、七六五</p>
<p>在上面所列的增减各項中，本年預算比往年有進步。因為政務費方面大致比去年略有减少。就是黨務費，從民國二十一年以來逐年膨脹的，本年也有减削，同時關於敎育文化費，建設費，則都略有增加。在一般國民的地位上說來，則在歲出的支配上面，對於消耗性支出的减少，那是有利的。</p>
<p>可是從各項數字十細分析起來，則本年度的預算，仍不能脫離已往各年預算的窠臼。在歲入方面，佔第一位數字位，仍是關稅，再總計關於間接稅項下的鹽稅，菸酒稅，印花稅，統稅，鑛稅等六欵，其總數就達六萬五千餘萬元之多，佔總收入額的百分之六十七。其次項的重要收入，是債欵收入，佔總數之百分之十三左右。再次之方是直接稅項下交易所稅，及交易稅，所得稅，銀行稅等三欵，佔總收入百分之八。餘下的百分之仔二，方是其他收入。所以間接稅跟債務收入，在總收入上仍佔着百分之八十重要地位，直接稅只不過附庸而已。</p>
<p>在歲出方面，第一位仍是軍務費，第二位仍是債務費，而各種消耗性的支出數字合計，跟非消耗性支出的數字，其所佔的比例，相差仍非常之大。所以不論在歲入或歲出兩方面看來，本年度國家總預算，在原則的進展上是有進步的趨向的。而就實際上的收支嚴格說來，那未，所改進的地方還是很少。</p>
<p>行政院所以將總槪算的總收支數字减削二千萬元的理出，大部份是為了實際收入的减少，為力求實際上收支平衡起見，所以一方面减少收入的數字，一方面節减支出的數字，足見這一次公布預算的鄭重。對於支出方面，已經行政院方面的斟酌，當然是减無可减的了，因此，這裏且討論歲入方面的數字。</p>
<p>對於間接性為中心的財政，不但伸縮性很大，並在國民經濟上絕對有害，而且分担不公平，不合一般租稅原則，這已是朝野一致的公論了。而本年度的預算呢，却還不能脫出了間接稅中心制度。當然，財政上的改進，理論與事實上未必一致，不能够一蹴而成的。所可慮者，本年度的間接稅各項中，恐怕照預算所列，已經發生問題。關稅項下，因近年國民購買力之减下，進出口貿易的沒落，已逐漸在减削中，最近半年來華北走私問題的日益嚴重，更是在關稅收入方面有絕大的障碍。就是行政院給立法院的咨文裏，關於此點也曾慮及，不過加上一點嚴厲緝私的但書而已。本屆預算上關於關稅的數字，雖已减下二千餘萬元，但照去年海關的統計，關稅收入比往年已减下二千萬元，本年第一季的華北海關收入，大多數都减少百分之二十八以上。則卽使從速厲行緝私，恐怕所减下的數字，也一定不止二千萬的。</p>
<p>這裏先提出間接稅下佔第三位的統稅來說。照最近幾年國家的預算上觀察，統稅在收入　的地位，已逐漸在提高中。實際上每年實收的數字，也比較預算來得多。這幾年關稅收入减少，用統稅來塡補，自也不失為一法。但統稅對於全國生產事業的負担加重，固然有可議之處，而近年來通國的實業，可以稱民族工業的，幾乎都在困苦的掙扎中。所以在一方面固然可以用方法來增加統稅的收入，而在事實上的推測，恐怕因各種工業的黯淡，而使統稅减少，也是意想中事。更可慮者是私貨充斥的今日，民族工業在市塲上抵抗的力量逐漸衰薄，則統稅的收入，也一定要感到减少的。就預算本身而論，則本年度終了以後，統稅的實收數字，要像往年一般的超過預算，又是一種可商量的地方了。</p>
<p>間接稅中佔第二位的是鹽稅，鹽稅之加重，影響於平民階級，其害處比統稅更大。鹽稅每年的實收數字，就近年預算上看來，也是逐年加長的。但是加長的原由，却並不是自然的，而是人為的。許多產鹽的塲所，很可以看到加多出產的趨向，而造成食鹽屯積的現狀，其性質近於預支。同時，有一部份產鹽的區域，已經與走私漏稅問題漸漸打成一片，將來在實收方面，也是一國問題。</p>
<p>直接稅項下的交易所稅等三項，列入預算內已經不止一年了。照最近政府方面對於遺產稅所得稅草案條約之公布，則將來企圖用直接稅來替代間接稅，或許可以見之實現。但依本年預算的數字，這幾項直接稅的數字，並不比較歷年有所擴張，可見施行之期，一定還有所待的。</p>
<p>照一般的財政原則而論，是經常的收入應該列作經常支出，而臨時的收入應當列入臨時支出，所以凡是債欵的收入，是應該作為臨時收入的，此次國家總預算中，雖將債欵收入列入臨時部門，但是經常收入與支出的總數，其間已略有不平衡。假如將歷年的預算加以考查，則可以得到一種原則。就是每一年度的預算無論稅收在總收入中佔任何地位，要結將稅收的百分數與債欵收入的百分數相加，則其數是相同的。易言之，某年稅收增加，則債欵收入减少，稅收减少，則舉債加多。所以用債欵收入來塡補預算赤字，已成為恒見之事。在表面上債欵收入雖在臨時收入部門中，而實際上情形，則早已支配作經常的用途了。要是本年間接稅項下减收的話，直接稅尙未開始，若依往年的例，這一筆差額，就可以加到債欵身上。但今年自從二月間發行統一復興公債以後，這龐九的數字，為往年所未有，就市塲上承買的限度來說，重行發行新債，其可能性極少。就是國府主計處對於將來舉債的章見，也以為：「政府現用整理公債方法，以完成法幣政策，平衡國庫收支，因為應付國難時期適宜政策，惟現時承受此公債者，參為銀行，購買公債之力量，以銀行新增之存欵額為最高限度，若超過此限度而發行公債，仍不免有引起通貨膨脹之嫌。」以我國金融組織尙未完全鞏固，民間對於貨幣常識認識的缺乏，則通貨膨脹後對於民族經濟，自然是有害的了。</p>
<p>債額收入一項，若同時注意債務費的支出，其間又有可注意的一點。卽債務費的支出，差不多等於債欵收入的半數光景。所以用舉債的方法來彌補預算上的赤字，卽使發行上不生問題，而債務費的增加，卽無異為第二年度赤字增加的預備，是一種預支性質。照目前已經减削後的債務費支出，在財政上已佔了很重要位置，何况再增加上去呢？所以用債欵收入來塡補赤字，决不是辦法。</p>
<p>國府主計處對於彌補預算平衡，提出了六點意見，就是（一）中央銀行的營業盈餘收入，尙不在預算之內；（二）統一公債是蘆鹽下，約可餘票面一萬八千萬元；（三）統稅的增收；（四）直接稅的開征；（五）債務費內有內外債準備金可以提撥；（六）債務費略有盈餘。上面六點意見，有一部份我們只能作為特殊的情形，因為决不是每年可有的事。就是本年的預算可以用上述六項辦法變迎來彌補，而將來的收支平衡仍是一個問題。</p>
<p>照上商行政院核减預算一原則上，其中有一條是臨時費非必要者不列，可見歲出方面所留的伸縮範圍仍然極大。</p>
<p>總之，在讀過了本年度總預算以後，很可以明瞭欲求收支平衡，還是須加上相當努力的。而收支的難以平衡的主要原山，仍在於收支方而不能有澈底的改進。所以今後暫時辦法，除了節流以外，關於間接稅收的維持，固然一方面用嚴厲緝私的方法來杜絕走私的嬙進，而直接稅從紙上搬到實施，更覺得是急不待緩的事。這還是平時的財政，如果到了非當時期，卽預算平衛的問滬，赤字的威脅，當然比現在更大，這更是不能不先事調謬的了。（七月二日）</p>

<p>聯邦準備銀行信用未兌付額之增减因素表（單位百萬美元（＋）加（－）减）</p>
<p>一九三五年　一九三四年</p>

<p>非會員存欵與其他聯邦準備賑目　四三六　（＋）六　（－）三一</p>
<p>（註）一〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇之委託欵不在內</p>
<p>上列報吿茲逐條加以銓釋，俾可知聯邦準備信用之重重重要性焉，</p>
<p>（一）貼現票據此科目代表會員銀行向準備銀行之借欵，會員銀行之借欵，所以作補充準備餘額之用也。借欵增加之因素不一，如（甲）會員銀行存欵增加；（乙）準備銀行出售證券或承兌票據；（丙）黃金出口或指定用途；（丁）通貨增加；（戊）非會員銀行在準備銀行存欵之增加皆是也。報吿上之其他科目，亦足以為解釋會員銀行向準備銀行借欵增减原因之助焉。</p>
<p>（二）購入票據與美國政府證券　此二科目反映準備銀行對於公共市塲之　用。承兌票據或政府證券之保有額增加，則投放聯邦資金於會員銀行處分之下；反之其减少，則聯邦準備信用之數量，亦隨以低落，此二科目之變　，可以表示準備制度所採之公共市塲政策，公共市塲購買之增加，可知準備銀行安定金融市塲之旨趣焉。</p>
<p>（三）實業墊欵此科目包括按照一九三四年六月十九日條例辦理對於私人企業之放欵，就金融市塲之關係而言，此種放欵與貼現票據，並無區別。</p>
<p>（四）其他準備銀行信用此科目代表若干細目，如所謂「流動」“Float”者，發生於準備銀行制度代理商業銀行收取之支票與滙票。「流動」與「未收欵項」“Uncollected　Items”及「遲收欵項」“Deferred　Availability　Items”有別，易言之，卽準備銀行所給商業銀行之信用，而商業銀行並未收到者。此科目又包括準備銀行保有之聯邦中介信用銀行債券，聯邦地產銀行債券，市債券，及外國中央銀行欠欵在內。</p>
<p>（五）準備銀行信用總數此為上列五科目之合計，乃聯邦準備銀行信用之未兌付總數。</p>
<p>（六）庫存金貨幣此科目代表國庫保存之黃金總數，黃金之增加，或由於進口，或由於指定用途之免除，或山於新出產，均足以增加會員銀行之準備餘額，此蓋因黃金必須售於國庫或準備銀行，而其所支付之支票係存入準備銀行之會員銀行戶下也。</p>
<p>（七）國庫與國民銀行通貨此科目代表國庫發行通貨以補助金融制度而直接負其貨任，此科目之增加，為國庫發行大宗貨幣之象徵，其結果則會員銀行所存準備銀行之餘額，因而增加。</p>
<p>（八）流通貨幣此科目代表各種實際流通貨幣之總數，流通貨幣之數量减加，則會員銀行準備餘額之數量减少，因通貨係會員銀行自準備銀行獲得，其償付鈔票乃取之於其準備餘額也。反之通貨數量减少，則其結果為會員銀行餘額之增加，因會員銀行歸還不需要之通貨於準備銀行也。</p>
<p>（九）國庫現金與存入聯邦準備銀行之存欵此科目為國庫可利用之資金，與其因出售政府證券而存入商業銀行之欵有別。其所包括之黃金，有匯兌安定基金，普通基金，以及國庫保存之貨幣，與政府存入準備銀行之存欵。此科目减少，足以表示國庫移轉現金或準備銀行存欵於銀行界，其結果為會員銀行準備餘額之增加。此科目增加，則可表示現金之付入國庫，或國庫移轉存入商業銀行之存欵於準備銀行，而會員銀行之準備飲額，隨以减少。</p>
<p>（十）非會員銀行存欵與其他聯邦準備帳目此科目包括多數細目，而以非會員銀行存欵為最重要。非會員銀行保持存欵於準備銀行，係以供淸算之用，此項餘額之减少，其結果則為會員銀行準備餘額之增加，因非會員銀行所喪失之資金，移　於會員銀行也。</p>
<p>根據前項簡單說明，以分析一九三五年一月九日之星期報吿，何種因素應負會員銀行準備餘額减少一億九千三百萬美元之　，始可决定焉。</p>

<p>五國庫現金與存在聯邦準備銀行存欵之减少　七〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>增加合計　二〇六、〇〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>會員銀行準備餘額减少之因素</p>
<p>一美國國庫證券之减少　一、〇〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>二國庫與國民銀行通貨之减少　六、〇〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>三非會員銀行存欵與其他聯邦準備帳目之增加　六、〇〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>减少合計　一三、〇〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>會員銀行準備餘額之增加總數　一九三、〇〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>近數年來財政之發展，及羅斯福執政時代銀行與貨幣新法之頒布，使聯邦準備制度管理信用之權力，發生絕大變遷。在新法統制之下，舊時管理信用之工具，不復存在，準備銀行不再以貼現率及運用公共市塲為操縱銀行信用之張本，取而代之者，另有新勢力在。</p>
<p>自一九二九九年商業不景氣發生後，會員銀行開始增加準備餘額超過法定限度之上。此種作用，一部分出於銀行信用之收縮，一部分由於黃金之輸入，又有一部分山於準備銀行之採取穩健金融政策。一九三二年，準備銀行開始聯買大宗政府證券，數月間其保有額增加十一億美元，該項政策志在增加會員銀行之逾額準備，以遏止信用之收縮，而獎勵其膨脹，結果雖不能收效，但在一九三三年，又復施行此政第，是時準備銀行更增加政府證券之保存額六億美元以上，其推一效果，僅增加會員銀行準備餘額至空前之比例，一九三四年九月，逾額準備共達二十億美元之多。</p>
<p>在此種情形下，凖備銀行之貼現率，成為無足輕重。會員銀行將其準備銀行借欵减至式微之數額，故在理諭上雖其放欵與存欵擴充二百億美元，而準備銀行之信用，並不隨以擴充。準備銀行保存政府證券約二十四億三千萬美元，原可出售於公共市塲，以銷滅會員銀行之逾額準備。然此項計劃，對於政府證券市塲將有壓低市價之絕大影饗，以國庫所負扶助政府實行復興計劃責任之重大，其不採取，固不煩言而喩矣。</p>
<p>就事實上言之，今日會員銀行準備餘額之管理權，大部分移轉於國庫。此項發展，大都由於美元貶値及國內庫存金貨幣重新估價，使國庫獲得二十八億美元之利益。就中二十億美元劃作安定基金，其餘加入黃金之普通基金。然就信用而論，其區別無關重要。重要之點，為國庫消費黃金，除輸出黃金外，將使會員銀行準備餘額有同樣之增加。</p>
<p>國庫會利用一部分黃金，以應國家之流動開支。其方法為存入黃金證書於準備銀行，此種作用，增加國庫之準備銀行存欵，藉以開發支票償還債務。所發支票，存入於商業銀行，最後復返準備銀行，請求支付。準備銀行則常收入會員銀行之帳戶，因此會員銀行所增加之準備餘額，與黃金輸入相同。一九三四年九月十九日，國庫有三十億美元以上之自由黃金與與存入準備銀行之存欵，若將此欵全數支出，則逾額準備，將自現時水平之二十億美元，增至五十億美元。雖此種發展，距事實尙遠，然會員銀行凖備之地位，與其謂之操於聯邦準備銀行，無寗謂之完全操於國庫也。事實上因美元之穩定，準備銀行僅成為國庫增加會員銀行準備餘額之工具而已。</p>
<p>國會條例，規定國內外購買白銀，其總數以有庫存黃金貨幣百分之二十五為度，此為國庫能增加會員銀行準備餘額之他種原因。而以白銀係國庫所獲得，國庫乃有發行銀證書之權利，通貨數量，因以增加。通貨之增，非實際上所必需，於是復返銀行，而由銀行存入凖備銀行，使會員銀行存入準備銀行之餘額增加，自有此種作用，而國庫得以干涉準備銀行之普通行動矣。</p>
<p>國庫對於金融市塲之勢力，旣如是其大。然準備銀行非不能管理會員銀行信用之擴張也，第（一）準備銀行根據一九三三年銀行法及證券交易法，有規定抵押放欵之廣大權力，可以遏止證券放欵之擴大，免致釀成投機風潮，如一九二八年至一九二九年之故事。第（二）更為重要者，乃一九三三年五月十二日農業整理條例，授權聯邦準備部，經總統之核准，宣布因信用膨張而發生之緊急時期，在此期間，得以任意隨時增减法定活期或定期存欵之準備餘額。此項權力，為聯邦準備部關一銷滅會員銀行逾額準備之途徑，使之復得管現金融市塲。</p>
<p>然此外所應研究者，往日聯邦準備部遏止信用膨眼之行動，常遭政治與事業界之反對。其在一九二零年及一九二九年，無不如是。今則在國庫須導之下，其勢力較前大為增加。準備部遏止信用膨眼之絕大權力；其行使未有不得政府之核准與扶助者，故準備銀行管理信用之將來，成為政治上之問題矣。</p>
<p>國庫除左右聯邦準備政策及利用自由黃金與發行銀證　以影響會員銀行準備　額外，在平常狀態之下，復能以普通財　　用，左有金融市塲。在每年三，六，九，十二月之十五日，國庫從事於徵收租稅，收回有欵，銀行之資金，以支付政府債務之利息，出售國庫票據，債務證書，長期債券，及償還已到期之發行額，交易之數額雖鉅。然以國庫投資技術之發達，使金融市塲不發生任何紛擾，利率亦不受暫時之簸動也。</p>
<p>此項技衛上投資之詳情及數額，逐李不同，其被支配之因素有種種：如國庫現金餘額，下季政府財政上之需要，租稅徵收之預算額，政府證券市塲之情形，及債務到期之償還額皆是也。國庫季節財政之運用，開始於十五日，發放資金以支付公債利息，償還短期國庫證券，及特種用途，—如一九三一年三月十五日之老年將校放欵，—其支付係以準備銀行之支票，收受者卽存入商業銀行，商業銀行復存入準備銀行，其結果為會員銀行準備餘額之增加，同時國庫收入商業銀行之支票，乃用以繳納租稅及國庫新債務者，此項支票收歸，則記入會員銀行在準備銀行存欵之借方，結果與支付相反。</p>
<p>若支付與收人適相符合，則會員銀行準備餘額不變，然實施上收入常較支付落後若干日，目國庫在此期間，以乞助於準備銀行為淸償債務之不二法門。借欵方式，係採取特種一日期之債務證書，其數額有大至數億元者，每日轉期，隨收入之數額而减少。</p>
<p>此種借欵收入準備銀行國庫戶下，以供國庫之支用，其結果足以膨脹聯邦準備銀行之信用，使會員銀行存欵增加。在平常狀態下；可使市塲獲暫時人為上之安定。防止造成該項情形之方法有多種；第一·準備銀行出售所參加之特種國庫債務證書於會員銀行，（大都在紐約），而將該欵於準備餘額下支出。第二·準備銀行在公共市塲出售政府證券，或减少承兌票據之保有額，所有到期票據，不加補充，使國庫借欵之影饗，得以抵銷。然此種方法，不易實行。例如一九三四年準備銀行出售少量之保存頗，卽發生不利影饗於政府證券之市價，勢將與政府財政政策相矛盾。同時承兌票據之保有額，為數極微，到期票據之不補充，不足以影響會員銀行之準備餘額，最後（第三種方法）允許紐約準備銀行之準備暫時低至法定限度以下，故在國庫運用以前之缺乏，數日後卽有逾額準備以為之矯正焉。</p>
<p>國庫運用之大部分，雖集中於徵收租稅李節，及支付利息時期。但平時之與銀行界不斷往來，其影響信用情形，較之季節投資為尤甚。按照慣例，國庫保存大宗現金，存入國內之商業銀行，而所開支票，則向準備銀行存欵支取，至必要之時，始將商業銀行之存欵撥入率備銀行焉。</p>
<p>故國庫之通行運用，使凖備銀行與商業銀行間資金之移動，發生二種途徑，一方面國庫以支票提取準備銀行之存欵，該支票復存入會員銀行，最後仍收入準備銀行之該行存欵內；他方面國庫自商業銀行提取存欵以存入準備銀行，其結果為支出準備銀行之會員悵，是故除收付之數額相同外，會員銀行之準備餘額，皆不免受其影響，例如一九三四年九月二十六日星期之末，會員銀行準備增加八予一百萬美元，大都由於國庫現金及存入聯邦準備銀行餘額之减少六千三百萬美元也。</p>

<p>— 闌刪</p>
<p>人人都慨漢着，說「上海是一個風化不良的所在。」話是一點不錯的，然而這怕是因為喜歡看敗壞風化的新聞的人太多了的緣故，所以纔行這麼多的敗壞風化的事件發生着吧？</p>
<p>當法庭審到那些桃色的案年時，——不論是强是誘是和的姦案——為了事關風化起見，趨之若騖的熱心旁聽人，總是年人的好奇心甚熾，每天看報時，便先將本市新聞那一張搶在手裏，聚精會神的在找那些有刺激靈感的題目的記載，細細地咀嚼，越長越好，津津有味。</p>
<p>中年人亦不甘落後，對於此類有吸引力的案件的紀錄，也是很感興味的。不過看起來時，不像靑年人的浮躁，却裝得非常嚴而冷峻的樣子，呌帝人不知道他是在看一段可使人心跳血湧的新聞。</p>
<p>由是我們時常羨慕那些做法官的他們可以肅然穆然地坐在公案前，對着男女兩造，追問他們過去了的浪漫蒂克的史料，以水銀瀉地無孔不入的問話來進逼他和伊，使他們一點不敢遺漏地，經着臉供認出來：——什麼時候開始發生關係，而且是在什麼地方。——某月某日日又一次；——又一交。如流水帳一樣的淸淸楚楚。——你想，這些又甜又苦的同憶，若山伊忸怩地自述起來時，該有怎麼樣的一種態度與聲調呢？然而我們不是法官，便永沒有這機會來經歷這一切。只能在翌日的報章上尋取其中的韻味，凝想兩人當時的態度罷了。</p>
<p>我們旣不能忘情於閱看這些有傷風化的新聞，而又偏要裝成道學家的口吻，嘆一聲「上海眞是個風化不良的所在！」以自顯其淸高，無怪乎上海的風化越弄糟了，我如是下了一個斷定。</p>

<p>漕河涇雖是說離開上海大都市沒有十幾里路，可是那邊已經是落荒的了，居民大都是以種田為生的，在工耕之餘，一班婦女們便起早遲晚　的穿織手套，因此，做手套便成了伊們的附屬工作。</p>
<p>伊們的工具　很簡單，祗是一根長約六吋的鐵針，這針是用雨傘的鋼骨做成，在這一根針上，穿上紗綫，便可穿織成各種綱式　透孔花紋的手套，式樣是很美妙的，什麼龍華塔，如意，五角菱等，更有先把花樣畫在紙上，而後照樣織成，不過這一種的價格，比較上要貴一些，大概八角錢一副，其餘的五六角錢　一副便可買了。然而在田裏工作繁忙的時候，價錢也就要漲一些了。</p>
<p>至於名稱，伊們並不呌手套，而稱謂手袋，推銷的地方，便集中在黃家花園和冠生園，因為在這裏　從上海來玩的人是很多，伊們便向遊客們兜售，據說生意是頗為中觀的。</p>

<p>我的幫鄕在東海之濱，那裏有長的圩塘，闊的海。</p>
<p>記得小時候，常常瞞了父母，偸偸地約了幾個小同伴，到海邊捉螃蟹，捉螃蜞，捉土蝪……捉得多了，拿回來當一頓午餐，其味比什麼都鮮美。</p>
<p>為了生活的驅使，遠離了故鄕，遠離了海。故鄕同我隔絕了好久；我不睹故鄕的芳顏也已好久</p>
<p>最近回鄕了一次，為了找尋我童時捉跡，又徘徊在海邊了。在童時，對於海，祗覺得大，祗覺得闊；但現在對於海又　另有一個觀念了。</p>
<p>海好一個　廣大的社會。在這裏，可以掃除你的萎靡，掃除你的頹廢！他會給你興奮，促你前進！因為海風的狂號，表示了羣衆的怒吼；海水的洶湧，象徵了革命的怒潮呀！</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第三回　雨細風斜還來留跡處　夜闌人靜獨寫絕交書</p>
<p>他寫完了之後，在燈下重校一過，信中間有如下一段文字，是這樣說：</p>
<p>蘭嗜好小說文字，自幼已然，而先生之作，哀感頑艷，尤蘭所折服。此可盡情言之，無所用其掩飾者也。然先生之文，刋佈報端，為人所閱讀而折者，多矣，此私心折服者，其為閨閣中人，當亦不在少數。若為先生所知，盡以西方男女交際相比例，竊以為失之太遠。古人之詩如李杜，文如韓蘇，誰不心悅誠服。其間若有女子，卽以為是心慕李杜韓蘇者，非笑談乎？舍下為書香門第，雖有女子讀書，而外言從不入內。先生憑私意揣測深閨少女之心，遽以一函相投，不徒令人震駭失次，且不信有文名如先生者所肯為也。</p>
<p>對於這段文字，自己回環念了四五遍。兩手把信按住，呆呆的注視了許久。便是心裏想着，這話够重，絕交書，也不過如此罷了。</p>
<p>第四回　視聽都非浮沉疑復柬　死生可託慷慨寄哀吟</p>
<p>人生作事，情感的衝動，總只有很短的時間。時間越長，情感的動盪，越是平伏下去，然後可以知道自己所作的是過分了。這樣思想上的變幻，在聽明人身上，所發現的很多。夢蘭自然是個聰明的人，他接到國器的信，想到他竟會到親戚家裏去調查，而且還寫信到學堂裏去問候，這要輾轉一傳說出去，知道的人，就多了。那不但與自己名譽攸關，而且這樣的事與家庭所絕對不能容許的。不突許的結果，那很難說，就是連帶着有了性命的危險，也未可知。因之憑了這一個出發點，越想是越覺得前途可怕，不能不寫一封信，把國器的路子給塞斷。因之在他意識判斷之下，一口氣寫了好幾封信。寫完了，自己一看那信的措詞，總是大激烈了。又覺得非刪改不可。可是刪改得平和了，又不能拒絕國器的要求，這讓他整夜的靜坐在燈下，想不出一個妥當的辦法來。最後寫的這封信，原是很用心的，慢慢的寫着的。可是在寫完了之後，他把信紙舖化桌上，兩手托了頭，對着信紙上行二行的靜靜看了去。看到那幾句重要的所在，自己也會搖搖頭，禁不住提起筆來，就把那幾句圈了。圈過之後，接着向下看，又是不妥，少不得再圈去幾句。（四六）</p>

<h3 id="c213">防空防毒常識展覽會印象記（上） <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>報紙幾經披一露空防產展覽會，已於今日開幕。會址在八仙橋青年會二樓。記者驅事前往參觀，　遇參與籌備工作的老同學，承他陪往各部一觀，茲將參觀所得印象拉雜寫下，以吿滬地一般民衆。</p>
<p>門前懸有藍底白字「防空防音常識展覽會」區額。上樓梯轉　就看見五隻大小不同的飛機，用鉛絲吊起，大有凌空而上的姿態。二樓入口兩旁亦有物品陳列：左側置有大小炸彈兩枚，一枚小的係一二八滬戰的紀念品。右側有民營化學工業社各種防毒用物，內中包括防毒面具，防毒橡皮衣　靴帽等物，都是我們沒見過的東西，牆角處站立一個穿着防毒衣帽的泥人，給觀衆一個很深切的印象。各物都是該社出品。桌上幷且陳列了各國防毒面具，以供觀衆參考。裏面有一隻也是一二八滬戰時我方恐怕敵人施放毒氣而臨時由各橡皮廠趕製的，做得很簡陋，和現製的防毒面具比較起來大有天壞之別。可是這隻防毒面具還成為歷史上的紀念品，而且得來不易，所以他們覺得非常寶貴。該處有該社專門人員講解各種防毒用物的構造效用。圍聚着聽講和參觀的人很多。據記者猜想各種防毒用物知道的恐怕不多，至於看見地的，一定更少了。</p>
<p>會塲入口處有架起之飛機一隻，兩旁有驚心怵目的標語：「我們有五千年的歷史，祖宗總算對得起我們吧！」，「我們有四萬萬人，人多又怎樣？」</p>
<p>各部展覽物品大都陳列在該樓右半部。防空的圖表頗多，據說都是向防空學校，航空學校，航空署等機關搜集得來的，這些對於缺乏防空常識的我國民衆很是需要，可惜字太小些。</p>
<p>防毒部份除民營化學工業社有各種防毒用品展覽外，在塲內又備了幾隻防毒面具，以便觀衆試戴，戴用的方法有照片和說明可看，所以不需人指導，自己就能戴用。記者戴了一戴覺得很不好受，據說防毒面具平時必須常戴，幷且戴時要行深呼吸。</p>
<p>現在防毒面具和橡皮衣帽等我國已能自造，幷且能够造得很好，可惜因置者尙不踴躍，成本不能便宜，全副防毒用物要賣到三四十元，這種價錢，當然不是一般民衆力能購置的。所以該會另有民衆防毒用品的陳列，這部份告訴民衆幾種簡單和救急的防毒方法，據說對於毒氣也有相當解毒的效力。</p>

<p>康健之路</p>
<h3 id="c220">腸胃之加答兒 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>夏令因適宜於病菌之繁殖，故疾病亦最多，食物不愼，輒致發生急性之腸胃加答兒，始嘔吐頻來，噯出酸水，胸部灼熱脹悶，心腹絞痛，或下痢日二三回至二三十四，大便如薄粥狀，或似水樣液，頗易赤痢症之轉歸，殊不宜忽視，且因此之故，胃腸機能多被損傷，雖急性症狀得以治愈，每貽為慢性病，如食思不振，消化不良，大便秘結等是，故須肥以有效藥物，行根本之治法，庶可一舉數得。</p>
<p>對於治此種疾患，學理上須迅弭腸胃之炎症，清除內部之釀酵物，並當調整其組織機能，則症狀即可瘳愈，而無後患，「强胃精」之藥理作用，即要把據於此，故急性腸胃病之嘔吐洩瀉，服之立安，以其係酵　之複方劑，依其中含有之生活ABD，為治生活素B不足之脚氣症特效藥，而其兼含蛋黃素及名貴補分，又擅療久病不復原及烟客便秘或斷癮。作為榮養補給，消化輔導劑。以治慢性胃腸病之見食生畏。食後飽脹，隠隠作痛，噯氣呑酸，嘈雜嘔噁，腸鳴腹瀉，大便溏薄，及因腸蠕緩滯而來之便秘多屁症，服此藥皆可逐步掃除，藥性純良，具有無上之營養價値。</p>
<h3 id="c221">淋病之血球增加療法 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 戴德醫師</p>
<p>應用血球增加法，於淋病之治療，至今臨床治騐之報告頗多，此血球增加療法，所以為目下淋病治療界有興味之問題。近時一般患者漸認識其效果。不但應用於男子，卽女子之淋疾，亦獲同樣效果。蓋淋疾不論男女，賴注射之局所注入等，往往難治者不少。故因適敵應需要，自然更須求別樣新方針之療法。據經騐之所昭示於吾人者，凡患者體內之白血球數量增加，則其食菌力量，必然旺盛，而全身之抵抗力，遂大為亢進。</p>
<p>對於此項療法，原為非特異性治療之一，醫界尙不知以此應用於內服製劑之上，及彼得氏研究後，始取化學成分，經特殊之操作，配製為內服藥，醫家稱便溢美，病家口碑載道，實開治淋之新境地。</p>
<p>查此製劑，卽今日盛行各國間之淋病「克淋儂」聖藥是也。Heuck氏謂有七〇——九〇％之治愈率，Rieger氏亦報告女子之淋疾治愈率有九五％。至『克淋儂』之功效，則善治急慢性淋濁及全身性毒關節炎，男子之攝護腺，膀胱，睪丸等炎症，女子之尿道，陰門，子宮頸淋等，一經進服。體內卽起變化，而獲强大之抵抗力，終於徹底根治，其藥性和平，故無敗胃及任何刺激，惟購時勿因他人曚混欺人，而誤購雜牌廉價品，致服後影響生命，宜認眞注意「克淋儂」三家為要！</p>
<h3 id="c222">靑年與老年 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 陳少華</p>
<p>人為何會變老年？</p>
<p>人為何會變老年，此眞為極有趣之問題，亦為每個人之切身問題。人只知因年齡關係而有老少之別，而不知實由生理上之荷爾蒙關係，蓋吾人在未發育時代，除生殖部分部外，兩性並無分別，迨至靑春發育期，內分泌機能開始旺盛四肢百骸，俱受荷爾蒙之灌溉，遂有男女之分，及年事漸長，內分泌機能亦漸衰老，於是一切均呈衰老象徵。但許多靑年男女，在此靑百期，往往因荷爾蒙刺戰，外受不良引誘，多發手淫惡癖，因而發育遂致停頓。致在靑年時代，即折入老年之境，且有下部法育不全，遺精，早漏，勃起力不充，女子則月經困難，白帶下，乳房臂部，平坦一如男女。而兩性同有症狀，則有久婚朱孕，頭目眩暈，心悸失眠，記憶力削弱，腰痛脚弱，行動遲鈍，髮蒼面皺，一切俱有老態。</p>
<p>此症旣由內分泌機能低弱，故最近盛行內分泌療法，但功效不著，惟梅倫氏法明之男用「補體康」，女用「補女容」，其療治早期衰老，及上述各種病狀，奏效殊速，逈非一般荷爾蒙製劑所能企及。其原料係用育春期之勇健動物，以科學方法提出，睪丸及卵巢荷爾蒙所製成。服後由血液中分佈各處，能推動內分泌機能旺盛，不僅發育不全，月經病等可愈，卽未老先衰者，亦無不獲效也。因此歐西各國醫師。競為償用。譽為男女之「靑春腺」云。</p>
<h3 id="c223">白帶並非小病 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>一般女子，往往以白帶為無關緊要之小病而忽之，其實大謬不然，許多危險之症象，多由小病而起也。白帶之所以容易釀成大患，以其局濕潤，最合細菌生存繁殖之條件，如一旦被淋菌及化膿菌等侵入後，極能破壞該部組織，故往往血膿交流，局部糜爛，小腹膨脹，排尿刺痛，行路跚蹣，狀極狼狽，精神萎頓，面色蒼黃。健康之美，因而消失。</p>
<p>「卡而雪地氏陰道片」一藥，乃根治白帶病之自療所法，無論遠年白帶，或新起白帶，用之均極適當，有抗正止分泌，平復組織，喰菌消炎之效。每晚於臨睡時，以一片放入，內深部，次晨洗去卽得。惟因體虛白帶者，可兼服「補女容」，因丈夫淋毒而傳染者，可兼服「克淋儂」，以消除內部淋毒，如此治療，無不短期內獲效，且愈後永可不發，照常生育。</p>
<h3 id="c224">成績最高之淋藥 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>値得注意之一種發明！</p>
<p>淋病為近低最流行之文明病之一，凡最大都市之塲所，則淋病患者之數亦最多。關於此病之治療，從前已多用色素注射劑，後亦以期功效不確，或者因製造不精，致副作用甚大。因此亦未差强人意。故終未有治淋特效藥之發見也。</p>
<p>然近因科學進步，從前認為難治之病，亦有藥為之根治，而今之「克淋儂」發明，亦其一也。考「克淋儂」一藥之發明者　彼得氏，蓋竭畢生心血所造成者，曾歷以動物試騐，結果均極圓滿，能在體內發生一種抗淋素，又能直接在病灶上發生殺菌作用，毫不損害健全部分。尤為傑出之特點，更無一切刺　嘔吐敗胃之副作用。服後無不在短期中根治。不論急性慢性淋，及併發症，續發症等，如尿道灼熱刺痛，他頭包皮紅腫翻轉之急性淋及攝腺炎，睪丸炎，前後尿道炎，女子則淋毒性白帶等，無不迅獲奇效，成績之優，超出任何淋藥，故歐美各大臨床實騐專家，無不競相採用。近頃我國醫家，亦甚多採用云。</p>
<h3 id="c225">鄧源和醫師肺病瑣談 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>診所：寗波路四川路口。診時：下午四至六時。</p>
<p>肺病之轉地與自宅療養</p>
<p>患有肺病之人，當然以離開事業，使精神脫離家庭之煩累為宜。所以轉換土地，亦能使心身愉快，食慾增進。然若無海岸及高由等特別適宜於療養之地，則轉地大可不必。假如患者能以堅强之意志，克服任何感情，生活照常不改，則在自宅療養，亦可獲治愈之望。但必須奉行空氣安靜療法。卽室內空氣常使流通，惟須防傷風，故不宜臥於直接當風之處。一方絕對安靜，力避神經之興奮。其次進服專藥，須有持久之恒心，切忌朝秦暮楚，見異思遷，蓋肺病為一慢性疾患，服藥若不經過半月至一月以上之時間，焉能望其根治？</p>
<p>攷肺病之治愈，全在增生結締組織，以包圍肺部之結核菌，若此種防禦機能堅固，塲菌卽無法滋殖，於是日趨於死滅之途，而結締織之生成，須賴連續的服用鈣劑。</p>
<p>在鈣劑之中，以鹽化鈣及沃度之混製品，治癆為最有效。「補肺拿爾」則此中之校校者。其補力直同於魚肝油，而是在熱又無賦滯之弊。性質和平，尤宜於虛人進服，善治肺癆之咳嗽咯痰，及喀血血痰，胸悶食減，肺部刺痛，潮熱盜汗，倦怠體瘦等。以其內含擅除痰咳之膠油，故於久咳頑痰，哮喘氣急，小兒百日咳，傷風，皆有卓效，迭經醫師實騐證明。對於久困肺癆之神經衰弱，失眠心悸，婦子之月經不調，男子之遺精腎虧，服此藥之外，可同時分別進服男用「補體康」以固精强腎，女用「補女容」以調經旺血，則衰弱易獲壯健，體重與精神必日形增加也。</p>
<h3 id="c226">「克淋儂」治騐一束 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>淋濁緾綿</p>
<p>患者連平山君，苦為淋菌所困，迭經醫治，皆鮮功效，濃濁淋漓，尿液亦濁時清，肛門會陰作痛，遇酒後勞動，則肩骨關節等處，亦每發痠痛，其尊夫人亦染此病，致白帶甚多，陰道潰爛，夫婦同病，倍覺可憐，嗣由友人介紹至戴德醫師治療，戴醫師認為慢性攝護腺炎，除略事按摩外，卽囑服「克淋儂」，以消炎利尿，鎭痛除淋。服未四五星期即告全愈。其夫人白帶亦內服「克淋儂」，外用卡而雪地氏陰道片用三四星期而愈。後又經血淸檢查十數次，證明無淋毒反應，故連君夫婦偕居今數載，並未復發。</p>
<p>忽又復發</p>
<p>前患急性淋，曾服「克淋儂」二瓶而愈，惟尿中尙有淋絲少許，金君以為根治矣，仍飲酒勞動如故，詎症狀陡變，尿液涵濁，淋絲加夥，排尿亦頗覺不早，小腹疝痛，殊現焦急之狀，乃乞淋病專家姚菊嚴醫師診療，認為淋毒性膀胱炎，除行手術及電氣療法外，列仍令其購服「克淋儂」，以清淋毒而促炎症之內消，經四星期左右之治療，始克奏全效。後雖迭經飲酒勞動等劇烈刺戟，始終未有淋毒之症狀始放心認為根治云。</p>
<p>身贏淋擾</p>
<p>患者邱天雲者君，身羸多病，後又患淋，致幷發夜夢遺精，故身體益覺困頓異常，曾服某淋病成藥，心中反覺憒憒欲嘔，致中輟停服，後聞治淋特效藥「克淋儂」，官有除淋之效，乃購服示及二鋰，尿液卽告澄清，會陰亦覺舒暢，讀服一星期，即將多年之病治愈矣。惟體虛遺精之症猶在，經陳少華醫師診斷，囑服「補體康」三瓶而愈，身體壯，有逾往昔，時贊此二藥為其活命之救星云。</p>
<p>睪丸腫脹</p>
<p>患者張鳳歧君，淋病失治，繼又併發睪丸炎，右睪丸腫脹，大如小拳。撫之堅硬，蓋此一側睪丸，已失去生殖之能力矣。惟幸尙有左側睪丸雖病而未至惡化，經姚菊嚴醫師努力挽救，一方囑服「克淋儂」，以消炎殺菌，前後治療一月有餘，卒獲治愈。後與某女士結褵，幸舉一子云。</p>

<p>夢精卽所謂有夢遺精，其原因為手淫過度，或由性的苦悶而起，患者之精早荕肉呈緊張，輸精管弛緩，其病變增劇，則無夢亦遺，甚至大小便及用力時，精亦漏出。伴發眩暈頭痛，健記衰弱等症，必須從速治愈。</p>
<p>本病治法，以鎭靜神經為主，徒事局部之藥治無益也，耐氏之「育精片」一藥，則具此等偉效，蓋其主效為鎭靜，實專治遺精漏，及因遺精而起之衰弱症的特效藥也。</p>

<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>「旣然生了下來，那麼，就活下去吧，打煞着活下去吧」！我從每一個人的臉上看出這一句話。</p>
<p>早上，當濃霧還沒消散，穿紅號衣的淸道夫推着垃圾車，朝西安門跑去。那里有土丘一樣的垃圾堆，在這垃圾堆的上面有着骯髒的母猪，他貪婪地嚼着那黃霉了的菜葉，一邊搖擺着他小小的尾巴；還有垂着尾巴的狗，倉惶的飛下來，接着又飛走了的烏鴉同麻雀，蒼蠅嗡嗡地呌着咀嚼着孩子們頭上的爛瘡</p>
<p>「丁郞，丁郞——」掛在車柄上的小鈴響了。霧還沒有散，看不見人影，只聽見這在霧里顯得格外遲重的鈴聲，孩子們便飛下土堆來，等着等着。</p>
<p>垃圾一倒下去，他們便聚精會神的檢，他們眼晴盯着，手里搶着，嘴裏嘟噥着。有時也用髒手摸摸頭上，關節上的瘡疤，在那里，蒼蠅正在張着盛宴……；在霧里看去，他們像一羣幽靈，聲音又沙啞得像上了崴敉的人一樣。他們忙着什麼呢，他們為着什麼呢？</p>
<p>那些孩子們的爸爸也許就是苦力，也許就是車夫，也許是工人，也許他們根本就沒有爸爸，這些誰曉得？但是我相信他們有些的父親是洋車夫。他們在熱毒的夏日，寒冷的冬天，那時候，北風在街上怒吼着，捲起一陣陣的灰沙。但這些當父親的可要蜷縮着身子，張開了嘴巴，向每個路人乞求着：</p>
<p>「坐車呀？拉去吧」！</p>
<p>灰沙滲進他們的嘴巴，粘住了他們的喉嚨。但當另一個路上走來時，他又用着熱切的眼睛注視着他，用哀惻的調子問：「先生，拉去吧」！入夜，他們的聲音更像一個在路上引魂的老婦人。他們忙着什麽呢？他着為着什麽呢？</p>
<p>也許他們還有年靑的妻，年靑的女兒。也許他們的妻同他們的女兒在街燈開始耀眼的時候就打扮得嬌嬌滴滴地上市塲里去，用淫蕩的眼去引誘那些獨身的澳人。在街頭，我看見她們，她們總躱閃閃的地站在黑暗的地方，躱在電綫柱的陰影里，用低低的聲音吿訴你說：「先生，可憐可憐我吧」</p>
<p>她們為什麽要站在沒有燈光的地方？她們的聲音為什麽那樣哀切？她們伸出來的手為什麼要戰顫？帥們為什麽要捨棄家，拋下自己的親人，自己的兒女，在暗夜跑到這街頭來？我又想起冬天的夜晚。夜是那樣靜又那樣冷。可是在胡同的角落里却時時傳來了一陣陣的呌賣聲：</p>

<p>老祖母在這鎭上是稱做好福氣的太太的，其實因為她平時樂善好施，且鎭上受過她好處的人就隨口給她個好福氣的太太。她的一個獨生子三十歲上就死了，沒有一年媳婦兒也故世，一個做祖母的老太太，再像母親那樣地去扶養遺留下來的一個孫子和一個孫女兒，她聽見好福氣的太太總是紅了眼睛回答：「苦命！一個兒子都養不到送終！」</p>
<p>她終於一對隔「代的姊弟拖養大了兩個沒有父母的孩子都很聽從老祖母的話，等到他們送進鎭上　學里讀書的時候，那個兼養二代的老太太才又回到　媳婦兒時代那樣高興起來。每天晚上，在煤油燈光下，她戴上闊邊的老花眼鏡陪着兩個孩子溫習夜課；但是常她發現初年級的學生有那樣許多課本的時候，她又歎息起來：</p>
<p>「隔一代了，眞是隔一代了！洋學堂里有那末許多功課」？</p>
<p>於是她想起她兒子讀書時候的一冊三字經，每天　師敎二句，還是讀不上來。現在的孩子一天要讀許多書，那些書又是她所看不懂的，她覺得年代實在過得太快了，然而兩個孩子的活潑天眞，完全像他們的父親一樣，那又像年代永遠停留在她做媳婦兒的時候似的，她把所希望於兒子的現在是交託在兩個孩子身上了。</p>
<p>孩子們如她所希望的那樣長大起來，他們從小學而高級，而到城里讀中學了。到城里去讀書却不能使她滿意，她說她不反對到洋學堂去讀書？但是兩個孩子是我自小領大的，他們不能離開我，寄宿在校里，什麽舖床疊被都要自己動手，兩個孩子幹得了這些事嗎？由孩子們的舅舅出塲說服了她。</p>
<p>「現在的孩子比不得從前了，城里這些路一天好打兩個來回，現在學堂里又有禮拜，過六天能够回家來。孩子們都是很聰明的，將來中學堂畢業出來有從一個秀才那樣威風呢！」</p>
<p>秀才，那是多末誘惑的名字呵！這鎭上一共出過兩個秀才，一個就是她的兒子。她答應姊弟倆到城里去住讀，她把秀才掛在嘴上：「洋學堂畢業就是一個秀才呢，孫女兒還要做女秀才。」她常從夢中笑醒過來。</p>
<p>但是一個呌人摸不着頭腦的「風潮」把她的女秀才帶走了。這伴新聞哄動着全鎭，那些不關痛癢的人都說起風凉話來：</p>
<p>「洋學堂有什麽好處，專門鬧風潮，什麼自由戀愛，還不是軋姘頭？好好人家的小姐做這種不要臉的事眞呌鎭上丟醜！」</p>
<p>老太太哭天哭地的喊着命苦。她像發瘋一樣穿上了藍夏布掛裙，支了龍頭拐杖要跑到城里去尋那洋學堂拼命，她要他們交出她的孫女兒來。終於在五里亭上她被隣舍拖回來，她似乎沒有出得這口氣，又奔上舅舅家里，用拐杖指着舅舅的額角痛罵：</p>
<p>「你妹妹死得多末苦，牠留下這兩個孩子你徧要送到洋學堂去，你說，你說，你騙我老太婆，做秀才，現在人都丟了，你還我的孫女兒……」</p>
<p>她哭倒在地上，用拐杖打着石磚，直到她疲乏的時候，許多人勸着回家。</p>
<p>女秀才的失落，馬上應響到弟弟的升學問題。弟弟中學已畢業了，兼着二代的老祖母現在無論如何不允許入大學。進大學要到省城去，一年祗有寒暑假回家來二次，在城里已闖了事，到省城去我還管得了嗎？？我們一姓里祗有你這末一個孩子了！老祖母現在是振振有詞地拒絕了孫兒的要求。</p>
<p>那個舅舅還是用最大的努力去完成甥兒的學業問題，他挨了老祖母無數次刻毒的指駡，終於：</p>
<p>「……女孩子會跟了人家跑路，男孩子會做出什麽事來呢？這鎭上就從來沒有進過大學的孩子，這不但是你老太太的福氣，同時，也是這鎭上的光榮呢！我又要同從前比較，那簡直是中了舉人！」這樣說服了她。</p>
<p>孫兒每年寒暑假回家兩次，兼着二代的老祖母還像進小學校那樣地問長問短。看見了那末多厚厚的洋裝書，她又驚奇得什麽似的戴起闊邊老花眼鏡去看那一行行的蟹文字，「洋舉人」那個名字又在她腦海里翻騰着。「不錯的，男孩子會做出什麼事來呢？女心外向，總是養兒子的好。一個洋舉人。」雖然這樣想着時她微微感到兒子死得太早的悲哀。「我要多活幾年，這個孫兒是我自小領大的，讓我看到他中洋舉人。」她每天焚香禱吿她的觀音菩薩。</p>
<p>她還是那樣淸健，接到了孫兒寄來大學畢業了回家的信的時候，她穿上了天藍夏布掛裙，支着龍頭拐杖，一口氣跑到五里亭了。祇要一個熟識的人在對面走來時，她就像回答那個人的問話似的，「孩子大學畢業了，中了洋舉人啊！」笑着向前走去了。</p>
<p>孩子回來了，他穿着外國人的裝束，坐在籐轎里彷彿從前出巡的知縣老爺那樣威風，但是後面的籐轎里帶着一個這鎭上從來沒有見過的女人，孩子吿訴老祖母那是他新娶的孫媳婦兒。</p>
<p>一個晴天的霹靂，—男孩子會做出什麼來呢，那也不是姘頭軋來的嗎？一樣的，一樣的，乳毛乾了都想向外飛，我命苦！老祖母覺得什麽希望都落空了時，她想起了三十歲上死去的兒子，拐到靈前去放聲痛哭了……</p>
<h3 id="c230">不務正業的人 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 費向東</p>
<p>村里的人們沒有不討厭郭得勝的：這不用說是因為他不務正業的綠故。對於他，有着各種議論在茶館里，村婦的閑談里不時地可以聽到。有人把郭得勝的墮落歸罪於他的母親。這老婦人自小就太徧愛自己的兒子，因而無論什麼事情都加以袒護，不肯嚴正地敎訓他。比如有一次郭得勝在路上調戲了女人，被那女人大聲地責駡着；而他的母親聽見了却出來帮口說那是女人自己不正經；郭得勝為什麽不調戲別人而徧徧調戲她呢——她這樣向大家替兒子辯護着——這還不算是那女人不正經的蹬據嗎？但是人們沒有不知道郭得勝喜歡作這種下流的事，所以都報之以冷笑。這樣，他</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>的母親就只好趕快替兒子定了親：郭得勝現在是有婦之夫了。有人以為郭得勝自己生來就是壞傢伙；將來恐怕更壞的事也做得出來。在村里，稍為自愛一點的人都迴避着他；不和他來往。郭得勝所有的朋友不必說只是一般吃鴉片烟的，或者是賭棍之流了。</p>
<p>賭棍方啊强是一個和郭得勝很親近的人。他開始把郭得勝帶到賭博的地方去，引誘他賭博。在那里看看賭博是發財的好方法，他就完全沉浸到這里來了。他輸去了自已和母親所有的錢；非常懊喪。方阿强却對他說，「你的賭法是錯的，要本錢多，才行的哪。」聽了這樣的話，郭得勝的心里想，這也許是對的；並且輸去了的錢總得翻本，於是他回到三天沒有回去的家里去。</p>
<p>郭得勝的妻子是賢良的婦人；在家里，她盡着媳婦的責任。可是，丈夫的不務正業却很使她傷心，她盡了最大的力呌他改正一下目前荒唐的生活，都沒有用。這一天的晚上，郭得勝回來了。起初他比以前溫和得多了，向她要錢；但是當她問着作什麼時用去，回答不出來。並且，她事實上也沒有錢。慢慢地郭得勝不耐煩了，他迫着一定要；就是手飾也好。她不肯，反抗着他的强搶，結果她被推倒地板，抬起頭來，丈夫露出一副兇惡的臉，指着她呵斥着道：「賤婦你不聽我的話我就踢死你！」女人就咽咽地哭泣起來了，這使他更加地忍不住，舉起眼來對準她的背脊就是一踢，她又重新倒下去了。接着，他就不管一切地奪過她的鎖匙，開了橱門，把她出嫁時帶來的所有的首飾都拿去換成了賭資，他又去找到方阿强重新回到那地方去</p>
<p>這一次一定要翻本了了郭得勝的心里想。他在那里留到第二天的早晨，一切都出乎意料之外的，他又輸得精光了</p>
<p>方阿强眞不愧為一個老賭徒。他看見郭得勝垂頭喪氣的樣子，就走過來拍拍他的肩膀，對他說道：「怎麽啦，你好像打敗仗的兵士似地？得勝勝負兵家常事，要不灰心才好！再去弄一點錢來吧，再接再厲，有一次運氣降臨到你的身上來，可就不得了呀！」郭得勝翻轉臉來對他就是一笑，但是笑得多苦澀呵</p>
<p>漸漸地，郭得勝在村里邊也成為有名的賭徒了。那賢良的媳婦的命運已經臨到了最黑暗的田地，她開始沉默起來，一聲不饗地對着他，也不再苦口苦心地去規勸他了。家里邊，所有的東西都被郭得勝偷偷地拿出去當光了；這一點，就連溺愛他的母親也流下了眼淚。過了沒有多久，老母親負祖不起不務正業的兒子所給予她的煩憂，在一個秋雨瀟瀟的夜里，連一聲呻吟也沒有地，悄悄也扔棄了兒子和媳婦長逝了。臨終的當兒，她用一種懺悔的神情，斷斷續續地說出這樣的話來：「我錯了！……我的一生都錯了！……得勝，你再不改悔，我眞……得勝　，你好好地……好好地勸　你的不務正業的丈夫吧！」那年靑的媳婦祗搖着頭，眼淚汪汪地，看着婆婆閉上雙目，永遠地停止了她生命的跳躍。這時候，郭得勝也偶而想到要悔改一下才好，有兩天沒有再到賭塲里去。但是，他是出名的壞傢伙，誰能給他一個改正的機會呢？於是，當賭棍方阿强又出現在他的面前的時候，他又拿了僅有的一件冬天的棉袍出去了。</p>
<p>看見丈夫再也沒有回頭的日子，家里又光光的什麽都沒有了時，那年靑的媳婦感到一切都空虛，絕望，就在郭得勝沒有回來的夜間上了吊。這慘劇使郭得勝及村中人所唾棄，所辱駡；直到有一天，這不務正業的人突然失踪了，他到底上什麽地方去，連方阿强也不知道。「這樣的人，就讓他永遠在我們的村中消失了吧，」人們都這麼說。眞的，郭得勝以後一直沒有回來過；現在，他那間破屋已經倒坍下來了。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) On the 12th, the Second Plenary Session only saw meetings of the various proposal review groups, with a break in the afternoon. It is reported that the presidium of the General Assembly submitted a total of fourteen proposals to the various proposal review groups. Some related to only one group, while others were related to multiple review groups. Except for the Education Group, which did not convene due to the lack of proposals, the various review groups first convened a joint review meeting of the Party Affairs, Political Affairs, and Military Affairs groups on the morning of the 12th. Members of the three groups, including Chen Lifu, Zhou Qigang, Chen Gongbo, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Chonghui, Gan Naiguang, Jiang Zuobin, He Yingqin, Li Liejun, and others, attended, chaired by Shao Lizi, to review proposals related to the three groups. Subsequently, the Political Affairs Group first held a joint review meeting with the Military Affairs Group, then a joint review meeting with the Party Affairs Group, and then a joint meeting with the Economic Affairs Group, separately reviewing proposals related to the respective two groups, all chaired by Shao Lizi. When the Economic Affairs Group convened, Song Ziwen, Zhu Jiahua, Zeng Yangfu, Zhang Daofan, Peng Xuepei, and others attended, chaired by Song Ziwen, to review economic proposals. Finally, the Party Affairs Group convened, with Chen Lifu, Chen Gongbo, Fang Juehui, Dai Kuisheng, Fang Zhi, Shao Yuanchong, and others attending, chaired by Chen Lifu, to review party affairs proposals. Each group completed its review around 11:00 AM and has drafted review reports, which have been submitted to the General Assembly Secretariat for discussion at the Second General Assembly on the morning of the 13th. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Second Plenary Session has concluded the acceptance of proposals on the evening of the 11th. It is reported that more than ten proposals from various committees have been received and are currently being reviewed by the proposal review group, which will draft review reports for discussion at the General Assembly on the 13th. It is said that although the number of proposals is small, their quality is very important. It is expected that the Second General Assembly on the 13th will be able to pass most of the proposals. It is anticipated that the Second General Assembly on the 13th will be able to conclude discussion of most proposals, and that if necessary, another general assembly will be held on the morning of the 14th to complete its mission, so that the closing ceremony can be held on the 14th. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the current situation, the attending Central Committee members have exchanged opinions over the past few days, summarizing it as a desire to prevent the situation from escalating. Many committee members who are concerned about national affairs have, in their private capacities, telegraphed Chen Jitang, Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, urging them to consider the nation and the country. The future is still difficult to predict. (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Li Hanhun telegraphed Yu Hanmou and his comrades in Guangdong on the 10th, requesting the Central Government to authorize Commander Yu to restore order in the chaos. The original telegram is as follows: "To Commander Yu (Woji Junjian), transferred via Deputy Commander Li (Bie) of the First Army and all comrades: Your telegram of the 6th has been received. Your excellent telegram of the 9th, with its strict words and righteous principles, is deeply moving. Tracing back to the beginning of this Southwest unrest, Hanhun, Commander Yu, and the various army and division commanders bitterly advised against it, unwilling to sacrifice the entire country for one person, secretly hoping to salvage this catastrophe. Commander Yu still wishes to use a strategy of 'drawing the firewood from under the cauldron' as a 'belated remedy,' to preserve the fame of the Commander-in-Chief and to leave a lifeline for the group. Your loyalty and straightforwardness are evident to all. However, your loyalty has been rejected, and things are getting worse. Our conscience has not been extinguished, and we cannot save people from a well. Hanhun is thus sadly cut off. Commander Yu and the comrades of the First Army have also risen up. My heart is exhausted, my will is not other. For crime or for merit, I only submit to public opinion. I pray that the Central Government authorizes Commander Yu to restore order in this chaos. We will be in the vanguard, giving our lives to fulfill our initial intentions. To the comrades in Guangdong, our voices have long been united, and we understand the greater meaning. Even if, due to differing circumstances, we cannot resonate at this moment, I deeply believe that you will eventually see the truth. I await your arrival, and I am impatient. Your brother, Li Hanhun, kowtows in ashes." (Central News Agency dispatch from the 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e41">On the Issue of Factory Inspections in the International Settlement <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>The direct purpose of the state in enacting factory laws is to improve the treatment of workers and reduce labor-management disputes. The indirect purpose is to promote industrial safety and develop the national economy. This indispensable legal code in industrial administration is of great significance. However, if there is only a factory law without the implementation of factory inspections to assess the extent and scope of the factory law's implementation, then the legislative purpose of the factory law cannot be achieved. Therefore, after promulgating factory laws, all countries follow up with the promulgation of factory inspection laws to establish a factory inspection system. Our country's factory inspection law was promulgated on January 10th of the 20th year of the Republic (1931) and implemented on October 1st of the same year. Currently, over twenty provinces and cities have implemented factory inspections in accordance with the law. However, the Shanghai settlement area, which has the most factories in the country, has yet to implement it. This is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Before the implementation of factory inspection laws, the Ministry of Industry of our country invited experts from the International Labour Office, Mr. Pone and Mr. Anderson, to China to assist and discuss factory inspection methods with the Shanghai settlement authorities. In November of the 20th year of the Republic, the Ministry of Industry again invited representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Public Concession, and the French Concession Municipal Council to hold informal meetings to continue discussions. At that time, two principles were determined: (1) There should only be one set of labor regulations in each industrial area of Shanghai. (2) The implementation of these regulations should be carried out by inspection personnel, whose actions should be uniform and not vary. Soon after, a third informal meeting was held, and three principles were determined: (1) The Shanghai Public Concession and French Concession authorities agreed to employ factory inspectors trained and recommended by the Chinese government to inspect all factories within their respective boundaries. These inspectors would be supervised by inspectors from the central inspection office at any time. (2) Factory inspectors in the Public Concession and French Concession should report the results of their inspections and any difficulties encountered to the Chinese government and the Public Concession and French Concession authorities on a regular basis. (3) Factory inspectors in the Shanghai Public Concession and French Concession should hold monthly meetings to exchange opinions and discuss solutions to any issues that need to be addressed. However, the board of directors of the Public Concession believed that these two resolutions had not been formally approved and specially convened a special meeting of taxpayers to amend Article 34 of the Yangjingbang land charter attachment to obtain the necessary authority to order factories to obtain licenses before establishing an inspection agency within the concession and implementing a set of industrial regulations that would apply equally to Chinese and foreign factories. Regardless of whether the special meeting of taxpayers had the authority to amend the Yangjingbang land charter and its attachments, even if they really had the authority to change the nature of the concession, this approach would not only allow foreign nationals in China to take advantage of the fact that our country's legal rights had not been fully recovered to apply their own country's laws, but also prevent Chinese citizens residing in the foreign settlements within our own territory from applying our own country's laws. Would this not be a major disregard for our country's legislative power? Therefore, the Municipal Government authorities protested, and citizen groups rose up in opposition. The concession authorities abandoned the original plan due to this backlash. Subsequently, although the central government twice sent representatives to previous International Labor Conferences to request the International Labour Office's assistance in persuading representatives of various governments to mediate, it still had no effect. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Public Concession authorities consulted several times before finally reaching a draft agreement of nine articles on the 25th of last month. The content of the agreement included four main points: (1) Our country authorizes the Municipal Council to establish a factory inspection office in the concession to implement factory inspections. (2) The inspectors are to be appointed in equal numbers by the Chinese authorities and the Municipal Council. (3) In cases of violations of laws and regulations that require the enforcement of Chinese factory laws, lawsuits should be filed with the court. (4) The Municipal Council must submit a report to the Chinese authorities. From these four main points, it appears that the right to inspect factories in the concession nominally still belongs to our country, and that the concession is to inspect factories in accordance with our country's factory laws. However, in terms of actual authority, our side has made significant concessions. Unexpectedly, this agreement has encountered further complications at the recent meeting of the Consular Body. The Consular Body demanded a narrowing of the scope of application of the agreement, seeking to exempt factories of countries with consular jurisdiction from inspection procedures. This is a major blow to the issue of factory inspections because the main significance of factory inspections is to protect labor, and the workers in foreign factories in Shanghai are all Chinese. They especially need the protection of the government. If factory inspections exclude foreign factories, then this measure will not only have little effect but will also put Chinese-owned factories at a disadvantage in competition with foreign factories. Therefore, the equal inspection of foreign factories is something our side must fight for. However, various countries are still adhering to the unequal treaties of the past. If there is no new development in nationalist diplomacy, this smaller issue of factory inspections in the Public Concession will likely be very difficult to completely resolve.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Communications issued instructions to all telegraph bureaus to maintain long-distance telephone lines, and instructed them to pay attention to the following points: 1. Maintain the balance of the lines to avoid noise during calls. 2. Once the method of transposing the phone lines is determined, it must not be changed slightly. 3.

The Ministry of Industry thought it was a good idea and decided to first send personnel to the United States to investigate silk sales and establish a sales office in the United States.

<p>— Our Correspondents Hu Zhongchi and Hu Yizang</p>
<p>Not long ago, we spent more than fifty days traveling to Japan. In addition to sightseeing, we visited many public and private institutions in administration, industry, and culture, and visited several grand expositions. We also visited our country's embassy and consulates in Japan to investigate the lives of overseas Chinese. We received sincere hospitality from Japanese friends everywhere, and in several major cities, we were cared for by our country's ambassadors, consuls, and Japanese friends as if we were family. We will never forget this warmth.</p>
<p>During this trip, we admired the beautiful island scenery, the brilliant Yamato art, marveled at the magnificent urban construction, the flourishing industrial civilization, and admired the diligent national spirit and the orderly political order. At the same time, we also sympathized with the suffering of farmers and workers and lamented that a few ambitious people were sowing the seeds of war in the hearts of peace-loving people. Those ambitious people, on the one hand, advocated war thought, and on the other hand, controlled most of the country's productivity, and massively manufactured murderous weapons—tanks, cannons, battleships, submarines, guns, bullets, and even chemical weapons and poison gas—in order to make their empire monopolize East Asia and dominate the world.</p>
<p>Under today's international situation, this attempt is obviously an unattainable dream. However, this dream not only makes the majority of the people in their country sacrifice their welfare in vain but also causes great suffering to our nation. For the sake of our own nation, and for the sake of the majority of the people of the "friendly country," we Chinese must unite as one and use the power of solidarity to awaken those ambitious people from their dream. First of all, we should get rid of the unnecessary fear of the "powerful neighbor" and inspire national self-confidence. Historical facts teach our nation: "We do not need to be afraid of neighboring countries, nor should we be afraid of neighboring countries." After this practical observation, we feel that the above belief is unshakable.</p>
<p>Now we are writing down the various impressions we have gained during this trip according to our itinerary, hoping that these messy materials can help some Chinese people understand Japan.</p>
<p>I. Police Network and Tariff Barriers</p>
<p>The morning sun had just shone on the Huishan Wharf of the Japan Mail Steamship Company. We carried our simple luggage and took a car there to catch the "Nagasaki Maru," which was scheduled to depart at 9:00 AM.</p>
<p>As soon as we arrived at the pier, the "red caps" carried our suitcases onto the ship. We were about to follow, but a Chinese constable standing at the entrance of the steps stopped us. He pointed to the words on the wooden sign next to him and said to us, "Please wait until about 8:30 to exchange your tickets at the pier before going up." We had no choice but to stand there and wait. Later, the pier was already crowded with people before four staff members from the shipping company sat down at two small tables to exchange tickets for passengers one by one. We filled out the passenger registration form, which had many items, exchanged our tickets, boarded the ship, and there were less than fifteen minutes left before departure. In Chinese society, we have always lived a leisurely and casual life. Coming into contact with the orderly and strict spirit of Japan's transportation organization for the first time, which emphasizes time economy, we really felt a little out of place.</p>
<p>After boarding the ship, we should have been able to relax a little, right? However, the Japanese Imperial Government's network of detectives densely spread across its own merchant ships prevented us from relaxing. We were thoroughly questioned by four plainclothes detectives on the ship, one after another. They not only inquired about our age, place of origin, address, and the route of this trip but also investigated when and in what school we graduated and what purpose we had in going to those places in Japan. They recorded all of our answers on large stacks of paper. We wanted to prove our words by taking out various letters of introduction we were carrying with us, but they were not afraid of trouble and copied even the most ordinary ones. We are Chinese news reporters, and it is no wonder that they paid special attention to our travels throughout Japan. However, many ordinary Japanese merchants on the same ship were also carefully questioned. We personally saw a Japanese vegetable merchant not only subjected to a long period of questioning but even a lecture record of a confectionery training class that he took out to prove his legitimate occupation was copied from beginning to end by the detective, taking a full half hour. This thorough spirit is not so much a commendable feature of the Japanese police system as it is a reflection of the underlying anxiety within Japan. Indeed, we have heard that despite the meticulousness of the Japanese police system, there are still many Communists secretly active in the country. Red propaganda is often found in some public institutions in Tokyo, and no matter how hard the detectives try, they cannot find the source of the propaganda.</p>
<p>Many of the first-class cabins on the Nagasaki Maru are reserved for civil servants who interrogate passengers. In addition to military and police personnel, there are also inspectors and quarantine officers from the Japanese Customs. We also felt the strictness of Japan's tariff barriers on the ship. Notices with "Passenger Attention" were posted on the ship, stating that any passenger carrying more than 100 cigarettes or more than 50 cigars when landing would be penalized according to the tax evasion regulations. Before the ship even entered Japanese waters, the "kyuji" (tea boy) on the ship brought two forms and asked us to fill them out. One was a passenger's report on tobacco for personal use, and the other was a passenger's report on carried items. We had a newly purchased small camera, and because the "kyuji" said that it would inevitably cause trouble at customs, we had to scrape off some of the paint on the camera and write our names on the outside of the leather bag to make it look like an old camera. We also had two small baskets of oranges, which were given to us by relatives. We heard that not even one orange or similar fruit could be brought ashore, so we finally had to throw away most of the remaining oranges on the ship.</p>
<p>The Nagasaki Maru sailed for a day and night, bringing us to the border of Japan. The sea view composed of the scattered islands along the coast of Kyushu as seen from the deck is very beautiful. However, when we saw the announcement from the Nagasaki Fortress Headquarters posted on the ship, we had a different feeling. The announcement drew a schematic diagram of the fortress area, warning passengers not to photograph, sketch, or record within this area. We knew that we had entered the heavily guarded Japanese military zone.</p>

<p>(Vienna) The agreement established between Germany and Austria is conditional on Germany's recognition of three main principles: (1) Austrian independence, (2) Germany's non-interference in Austrian internal affairs, and (3) the activities of the National Socialist Party being an internal affair and not a subject for negotiation. Observers have declared that the mutual relations and economic development of Germany and Austria should be based on these principles. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Responsible officials have declared that the interim measures signed between Germany and Austria will not have any impact on Austria's internal affairs. The Austrian government has decided to strictly curb the activities of the National Socialist Party and will promulgate a new law today called the "National Security" Law. All means used to punish rebellious acts and the German-Austrian merger movement shall be specified in detail. As for the restoration of the old Habsburg royal family, it should be regarded as a purely internal matter and not within the scope of diplomacy. In short, the political program determined by the late Prime Minister Dollfuss will continue to be followed without change, and the principles contained in this program should also be endorsed by Germany.

<p>(Vienna) It is rumored that after the establishment of the German-Austrian agreement, the Austrian cabinet will be reorganized in order to gain German favor. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) After the establishment of the German-Austrian agreement, the discussion of reorganizing the Austrian cabinet was implemented last night. Dr. Hoste Laue has been appointed as Minister Without Portfolio, and the position of Foreign Minister, originally held concurrently by Prime Minister Schuschnigg, has also been changed to be held by Schmidt. Hoste Laue is currently 54 years old, a Catholic, and has always advocated pro-German sentiments. He holds a doctorate from the University of Monk City in Germany and once served as the director of the National Archives. Schmidt is currently 37 years old, served as an attaché at the Embassy in France, and has been working in the Presidential Palace since 1928, originally as the secretary to President Miklas, and then as the Deputy Director of the Civil Service Department until now.

<p>(Vienna) The German-Austrian friendship agreement was published in the government gazette today. According to the agreement, Austria recognizes itself as a Germanic country, and Germany also recognizes Austria's complete autonomy. The two governments will also create the necessary environment for implementing German-Austrian consultation in several different ways. However, the gazette also stated that the Rome Protocols of 1934 and 1936 will not be changed due to the new agreement. Therefore, the agreement has opened the way for an alliance between Italy, Austria, and Germany, connecting the North Sea to the Mediterranean Sea to resist the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg and German Propaganda Minister Goebbels simultaneously read the same communiqué in their respective capitals last night, broadcasting it to the entire country via radio. The communiqué stated that Austria and Germany believe that the establishment of a friendship agreement between them will ease the tense situation in Europe. The terms of the agreement are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Germany recognizes Austria's full sovereignty.</p>
<p>(2) Each country agrees not to directly or indirectly interfere in the other's internal political development, including the issue of Austrian National Socialism.</p>
<p>(3) Austria intends to maintain a special policy towards Germany in accordance with the basic principle of Austria recognizing itself as a Germanic country, so as not to disturb the Rome Protocol of 1934 and the additional documents of 1936, and the status of Austria, Italy, and Hungary as parties to this document.</p>
<p>The communiqué indicated that the agreement would be completed with various separate plans. It is also reported that both parties have satisfactorily agreed on the amnesty issue, and each country's newspapers can be sent to the other's country. As for economic adjustment measures, the main condition will be the exchange of goods. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Rome) All of Italy is very satisfied to hear the news of the establishment of the German-Austrian friendship agreement. Italy has a close relationship with the negotiations of this agreement, but initially did not expect it to be so quickly successful. Germany's recognition of Austrian independence has always been the only difficulty between Italy and Germany. Now that this difficulty has been removed, Italy and Germany can closely unite. It is expected that the most recent consequences of the agreement will be:</p>
<p>(1) At the future Locarno Conference, Italy will refuse to participate if Germany is not allowed to join.</p>
<p>(2) Italy will abandon its plan to reform the "Stresa Front."</p>
<p>The authorities deny that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has a plan to restore the Four-Power Pact of Italy, Britain, France, and Germany, because although sanctions against Italy have been lifted, Italy's wishes have not been fully satisfied and it is still unable to participate in general European cooperation. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) London political circles are very relieved to hear the news of the success of German-Austrian friendship, because the agreement will greatly change Germany's attitude towards Austria. It is expected that Germany will conduct large-scale economic activities in Austria, creating a close relationship between the two countries. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Political circles here have remained silent about the new developments between Austria and Germany yesterday, and the authorities have not made any criticisms. However, it is generally believed that Germany will pay attention to other issues in the future, such as the Danzig issue and colonial issues. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<p>(Rome) Yesterday, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg exchanged telegrams as a guarantee of friendship between the two countries. Schuschnigg announced the signing of the new German-Austrian friendship agreement, stating that the agreement aims to make a very effective new contribution to the work of peace. Mussolini replied that all those who cherish pacifism must be satisfied and celebrate the agreement, which is a significant step towards European reconstruction. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Rome) After signing the agreement with the German authorities, Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg immediately telegraphed Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, saying, "I would like to take this opportunity to express my wish that the friendship between the two sides will continue to grow, and I agree with you completely, and will closely cooperate in accordance with the Rome Protocols established between Italy, Austria, and Hungary on March 17, 1934, and March 24 of this year." The Prime Minister immediately replied by telegraph, also mentioning the Rome Protocol, and said, "The agreement you have just signed is of great importance to the reconstruction of Europe and the Danube region."

<p>(Rome) After the establishment of the German-Austrian agreement, semi-official circles here expressed satisfaction, saying that this agreement was discussed by Prime Minister Mussolini and Austrian Prime Minister in the town of Gameda more than a month ago. Official officials also added criticism, saying that the most satisfactory aspects of this agreement are two points: (1) German leader Hitler made a declaration on May 21, 1935, stating his willingness to respect Austrian independence, and this time he reiterated this statement; (2) Austria still adheres to the Rome Protocols established by Italy, Austria, and Hungary on March 17, 1934, and March 24 of this year, and Germany also supports this.

<p>Warsaw: People here have expressed their welcome for the German-Austrian agreement, believing that this is the foundation for an understanding between Italy and Germany. Responsible officials also said that Poland has had the desire to approach Italy and Germany for a year, and this trend will inevitably become stronger. What the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been working on in the past is to improve relations with Italy while not offending Italy. If Italy, Germany, and Poland cooperate in the future, Germany and Italy can take active actions in the Balkan Peninsula. However, some people in political circles have slightly different views. They believe that if Germany's power to expand outward gains the support of Italy and Austria in the south, it will inevitably turn to the east, damaging Poland. Judging from Germany's recent attitude towards the Free City of Danzig, it can be known that this statement is not false. (Havas, 12th)</p>

<p>(Vienna) People from all walks of life have different opinions on the agreement established between Germany and Austria, but they generally express satisfaction with the appointment of Hoste Laue as Minister Without Portfolio and Schmidt as Foreign Minister. It is said that Hoste Laue has always advocated cultural rapprochement with Germany, but does not agree with the merger of Germany and Austria politically. Here is an analysis of the views of various parties on the German-Austrian agreement: Although the Catholic Party is divided into those who tend towards Germany and those who tend towards the Vatican, they all have doubts about the practical effects of this agreement. Members of the Internal Guard generally support the agreement in principle, but say that it is still difficult to reach a conclusion at this time. The Patriotic Defense League advocates taking a vigilant attitude for the time being. As for the royalists, they regret that the agreement did not simultaneously make a decision on the restoration of the old Habsburg royal family, believing that the merger of Germany and Austria could be stopped after the restoration of the Habsburg royal family, which would be more powerful than the promises that German leader Hitler could provide. "Since the issue of Austrian restoration is outside the scope of the agreement, the issue of the form of government is purely within the scope of internal affairs, and the German government has probably recognized this." Therefore, the royalists will intensify the restoration movement. In addition, pro-German factions who are not members of the National Socialist Party also express satisfaction. However, members of the National Socialist Party are deeply puzzled and very frustrated as to why leader Hitler refused to provide assistance. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Italian Prime Minister Mussolini Prepares to Propose a Startling Plan: No Intention to Restore the Stresa Front; Foreign Policy Based on Pro-German Sentiment; Advocates Concluding a Six-Power Pact Including Russia and Poland <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) Since the establishment of the German-Austrian agreement, responsible officials here believe that Italy's foreign policy in the future should aim at two goals: cooperation among the major European powers and the issue of the Danube River region. Prime Minister Mussolini is currently on vacation and will propose a startling plan as soon as he returns. However, although Italy is willing to re-participate in various European issues, it has no intention of restoring the Stresa Front, because the three countries of Britain, France, and Italy established this front to prevent Germany from interfering in Austrian internal affairs. Now that the German-Austrian agreement has been established, there is no risk of interference in Austrian internal affairs, so there is no need to restore the Stresa Front. If the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty hold a meeting in Beijing in the future without Germany's participation, it would be like restoring this front, which is not what Italy wants. Responsible officials also believe that the reason why the German-Austrian agreement was established early was to enable Italy to decide its position on the Locarno Conference in a timely manner and announce it to the world. In short, Italy's current foreign policy is based on the friendship between Italy and Germany. If the Western European peace plan proves impossible to realize, this friendly relationship should be further enhanced and strengthened. At that time, the cooperation between Italy and Germany will be sufficient to deal with everything, and there is no need to ask for anything else, nor is it necessarily impossible. However, Italy should still propose a new European pact plan at this time, advocating that Italy, Germany, Britain, France, Poland, and Soviet Russia conclude a six-power pact. In the minds of Italian politicians, it is necessary for European countries to cooperate with each other according to their strengths and weaknesses, which is a necessary condition for organizing Europe. As for the issue of the Danube River region, the Little Entente countries originally provided guarantees for Austrian independence, but since Italy, Austria, and Hungary established the Rome Protocols in March 1934 and March of this year, and the German-Austrian agreement was established yesterday, this guarantee is of no use. Although the Little Entente countries can establish an agreement with Austria in the future, in fact, they must negotiate with Italy and Germany at the same time. After the establishment of the German-Austrian agreement, Germany can be considered to have joined the Rome Protocols previously established by Italy, Austria, and Hungary. According to this protocol, any signatory country often consults other signatory countries before conducting diplomatic negotiations with other countries. In addition, although the Little Entente countries can join the Rome Protocols, they should do so separately. In a nutshell, Austria is in an intermediate position between the Little Entente countries and Italy and Germany, and it is also the medium for Italy and Germany to enter Eastern and Southern Europe.

<p>(Vienna) After the establishment of the German-Austrian agreement, Prime Minister Schuschnigg, because Hungary is one of the signatory countries of the Rome Protocols of Italy, Austria, and Hungary, informed Prime Minister Gömbös of the country of the progress last night. Gömbös is currently recovering from illness in the city of Nagykanizsa near the capital of Hungary. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>The capital of Hungary: People in Hungary have always advocated the formation of a group by Italy, Germany, Hungary, and Austria. Therefore, they have praised the agreement established by Germany and Austria yesterday, and believe that after the autocratic countries unite with each other, the impact they can have on European politics will be greater than in the past, and it is expected that Poland will also join this group.

<h3 id="e77">British and French Newspaper Commentary <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>(London) All newspapers published on Sunday commented on the new German-Austrian agreement. The Sunday Times stated that this was the act of a clever politician and congratulated Hitler on the success of this move. The Sunday Dispatch urged the British government to quickly cut off all the entanglements that might drag Britain into enmity with the new group. The News of the World said that if the agreement is successful, it must be due to the secret understanding between Italy and Germany. The overall situation has changed rapidly, and the Locarno Conference may be postponed as a result. As far as Britain is concerned, Germany's recognition and respect for Austrian rights can only be met with satisfaction. The Reynolds News stated that the alliance between Austria and Germany was actually at the instigation of Mussolini, and this was another step by Mussolini in forming a common fascist front. The Sunday Referee stated that Hitler was forced by Mussolini to sign a document actually withdrawing from Austria. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the establishment of the German-Austrian agreement, people outside official circles here commented that this move may have five effects: First, the danger of war can be temporarily avoided; second, the cause of estrangement between Germany and Austria is removed; third, France's solution to the issue of Germany unilaterally abolishing the Locarno Treaty becomes more difficult; fourth, Germany's attention has probably shifted to other issues, such as the Free City of Danzig and the recovery of pre-war colonies, which can be inferred from this; fifth, this agreement is actually a "new Central European group", the impact of which is very significant. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the establishment of the German-Austrian agreement, all newspapers here commented, saying that this move has six meanings: (1) This agreement was established only after the complete agreement of German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and they will inevitably share its benefits; (2) the danger of the restoration of the old Habsburg royal family can be temporarily avoided; (3) it can be seen that Italy is unwilling to displease Germany on the eve of the opening of the Locarno Conference; (4) the two autocratic countries of Germany and Italy are uniting with each other at a time when the League of Nations is wavering, which poses a threat to the League of Nations itself; (5) the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Austria before the European War may be revived; (6) Germany's attention has now shifted to the issues of the city of Danzig and the recovery of pre-war colonies. Bertrand de Jouvenel, a famous reporter from Le Parisien, said, "The Austrian cabinet has been reorganized, and Hoste Laue, the former chairman of the Catholic University Federation, who originally belonged to the pro-German faction, has been appointed as Minister Without Portfolio, and Schmidt, who is a member of the National Socialist Party and hardly conceals it, has also been appointed as Foreign Minister."</p>
<p>A telegram from Le Petit Parisien's correspondent in Rome stated, "It is reported that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini intends to take the opportunity to propose a new European pact plan, which is no longer the previous four-power pact, but will include Soviet Russia and Poland and become a six-power pact." Madame Tabouis, a famous reporter from the same newspaper, said, "Although Germany will not use force to invade Austria, in reality, German power will inevitably gradually invade. As for the consequences that this agreement may cause for the major powers, it is better than the restoration of the old Habsburg royal family in Austria or Germany using force to implement the German-Austrian merger. In short, the agreement recently established between Germany and Austria is actually a treaty of alliance, which European countries will inevitably accept because it is less harmful, but they must know that Austria has become a part of Germany and must not be confused by it." Le Populaire, the organ of the Socialist Party, stated, "The German-Austrian agreement, at first glance, is originally impeccable, but when examined carefully, the first general attack of a certain country on the League of Nations and collective security institutions has already seen its beginning, and Italy will inevitably be happy to participate in this."

<p>(Rome) Italy today formally refused to attend the Beijing Conference to discuss the situation in the Rhineland and draft an alternative treaty to the Locarno Treaty. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Belgian Prime Minister Janson sent a letter to the Italian government, asking it to send a representative to the Locarno powers meeting to be held in Beijing. The Italian government now replied that Italy is always prepared to make a strong contribution to peace, but at present it has to pay attention to certain obligations in the Mediterranean, which are obstacles to its participation in the meeting. Furthermore, the Italian government believes that Germany should also be invited to participate in the initial stages of the Locarno Conference, because the absence of one of the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty will not only fail to clarify the current situation, but will instead increase disputes. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Prime Minister Mussolini recently received German Ambassador Hassel, and discussed the Locarno Conference with him. According to reports, the government has not yet submitted an answer to the invitation issued by Belgian Prime Minister Janson, the convener of the conference. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Since Germany and Austria have already established an agreement in advance, and Italy has refused to participate in the Locarno Conference (scheduled to be held in Beijing on the 22nd of this month) because Germany has not received an invitation, officials here have commented one after another, believing that Germany's recognition of Austria's complete sovereignty may have obtained important exchange conditions from Italy. This can be verified in the shortest possible time. However, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini does not want to sign a permanent agreement with any country, so the revival of the pre-war alliance treaty between Germany, Austria, and Italy is not credible. The current question is whether Britain and France can meet the various demands made by Italy, that is, whether the mutual assistance measures established by Britain with various countries along the Mediterranean coast last year can be abolished, whether the Locarno Conference can immediately invite Germany to participate, or whether Britain, France, and Belgium will hold a meeting to discuss a Western European defense pact and disregard Germany and Italy. All of this must be decided. Regarding this level, officials believe that the future Locarno Conference should adopt a compromise approach, that is, Britain, France, and Belgium will hold a meeting on the one hand, and negotiate with Germany and Italy on the other hand, so that when the conference reaches the second stage (that is, the negotiations on the overall European situation), Germany and Italy will come out to participate. According to this, the experts of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should thoroughly study the past events of the Locarno Treaty issue, and prepare for the meeting on the level of Italy's promise to participate. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian government has not yet submitted a reply to the invitation to the Locarno Conference, and Germany and Austria have already established an agreement. Therefore, all observers have a deep impression, and the position taken by Italy is summarized as follows: (1) Italy can only participate in the reconstruction of Europe after all sanctions have been lifted. The so-called sanctions not only refer to purely sanction measures, but also to various measures with a sanction nature, such as the mutual assistance measures established by Britain with various countries along the Mediterranean coast last year, which should also be abolished; (2) The French government has declared the mutual assistance measures previously established by Britain and France invalid, which Italy is very satisfied with; (3) Italy is currently working to reconcile the attitudes of Germany and Italy; (4) Italy wants Germany to participate in the Locarno Conference.

Therefore, the people in that area can only patiently endure and pray before the heatwave breaks through. (National News Agency, 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e80">A Comprehensive View of Japan's Economic Policies Toward China: Collaboration in Name, Aggression in Reality, Seizing Resources and Actively Preparing for War <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Special Article from the China Alliance News Agency: Japan's Ambassador to China, Kawagoe Shigeru, has been in China for less than a month. He has expressed his views on Sino-Japanese issues in several talks, mainly stating that to adjust Sino-Japanese relations, one should start with economic collaboration. First, in North China, a special zone between Japan and "Manchukuo," Japan should provide economic assistance, invest in North China railways, implement rural collaboration and guidance, and investigate and develop mines. On the surface, this diplomatic policy seems more moderate than "bomb diplomacy with fists." However, in essence, it is the most vicious plan to annex the entire North China, following the increase of troops and in coordination with the troop increase policy. This is because Japan's economic policy toward North China is based on pouring all efforts into preparing for a major war. The content of this policy is: (1) Seizing military raw material resources; (2) Placing existing railways and highways under Japanese control, preparing to transform them into military routes when war breaks out; (3) Constructing roads with military significance. Kawagoe's diplomatic ambition coincides with this content. Who says it is a symbol of Japan's mitigated aggression against China? Now, let's cite specific facts to further expose the role of so-called economic collaboration. First, let's talk about the railway issue. Currently, the most actively pursued project in the Japanese plan is the construction of the Cangshi Railway. Once this railway is completed, it will have three major functions: (1) It can transport coal from Shanxi directly to Tianjin or Qingdao; (2) It can facilitate the exploitation of resources along the line; (3) It can be used to transport troops from Qingdao to Shanxi and Suiyuan. Another planned project is the extension of the PingSui Railway, connecting it with Chifeng in the puppet Rehe Province via Zhangbei and Dolun. Needless to say, this project has even greater military significance, as it can provide another shortcut for transporting military supplies and attacking Outer Mongolia. In addition, the BeiNing Railway and the PingSui Railway are actually already under its control because of direct or indirect relations with Japan. Then, there is the issue of assisting rural reconstruction, the main point of which is to encourage the cultivation of cotton. Because Japan is an industrial country, cotton is the main raw material for the textile industry. However, Japan is very lacking in this regard and has always imported it from India and the Americas. If a conflict occurs with Britain and the the United States, this important source may be cut off, putting the textile industry at risk of fundamental bankruptcy. Therefore, the military and capitalists regard North China as the target for cotton production and also plan to establish natural research institutes to improve cotton production, making it more suitable for the needs of Osaka textile industry capitalists. However, Japan's purpose in assisting and encouraging North China farmers to grow cotton is not limited to this, because its assistance and encouragement will allow it to control China's cotton resources. As a result, China's "flickering candle"-like textile industry will inevitably face even more serious difficulties. Third, there is the issue of developing mineral resources. According to surveys, the coal reserves in North China account for 80% of China's total reserves. Shanxi Province alone has more than 12.7 million tons, and among these more than 12 million tons, 3.64 million tons are anthracite, which is one of the raw materials most needed by Japan's ordinary industries and military industries. Naturally, it is coveting and unwilling to let go. At the same time, it also has a plan to take the British-owned Kailuan Coal Mine into its own hands. On the one hand, it uses the products of the Fushun Company to hit the Kailuan Company's sales market in North China, and on the other hand, it spreads a lot of rumors, which will inevitably lead to Kailuan being ceded to Japan. In addition, there is also the seizure of Chinese coal mining enterprises. Now, companies such as Linyuan and Liujiang have been plundered by it. Speaking of iron, according to surveys, the total reserves in China are 236.854 million tons, and Xuanhua in Chahar alone accounts for 39%. In addition to Xuanhua, there are still 32.424 million tons in Hebei Province and 13.7 million tons in Shandong Province. Japan needs about 2.5 million to 3 million tons of iron every year, most of which depends on foreign countries. Therefore, how can it not want to get involved in the iron ore in the provinces of North China under military and political control? Are these facts not enough to illustrate the true face of the economic diplomacy advocated by Kawagoe? We have already said above that this economic diplomacy is coordinated with the troop increase policy, and the purpose of annexing the entire North China is in the economy, and the purpose of this economy, in addition to selling goods and plundering raw materials, also has the function of preparing for war. The troop increase is to cover up the promotion of this goal. Under the support of the military, Kawagoe came to China to take office amid the voice of increasing troops. The seriousness contained in the so-called economic collaboration is very obvious. "Politics is the concentrated expression of economics." We believe that apart from those with ulterior motives, everyone understands that the so-called economic collaboration is to make North China fall into a completely colonial status.</p>

<p>Warsaw: Following the fiery speech given by Danzig Free City Senate President, Greiser, at the League of Nations Administrative Council a few days ago, the Administrative Council immediately entrusted the Polish government to investigate the situation in the city. Colonel Beck, the Foreign Minister, traveled to the city yesterday to begin the investigation. The opposition newspapers here have commented on this, stating that the League of Nations should immediately take a strong stance to maintain the city's current administrative system. Among them, the Polish Socialist Party's organ, the Robotnik newspaper, attacked Colonel Beck in harsh terms, stating, "The powers originally held by Poland's High Commissioner in the city, Babej, have been diminishing day by day and are about to become those of an ordinary consul. If our country recognizes and amends the city's current administrative system, then our access to the sea will be controlled by Germany," etc. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Danzig City: Regarding the future of Danzig City, the National Socialist Party's organ, the Vorposten newspaper, recently stated that when City Senate President Greiser gave a speech at the League of Nations Administrative Council a few days ago, he did not request to amend the current administrative system. What he requested was to redefine the relationship between the League of Nations and Danzig City, so that the free city could develop freely, as desired by a Germanic national sovereign state. The newspaper also attacked League of Nations High Commissioner Lester for still appearing in the streets, stating, "In the current situation, Lester should stay behind closed doors and not show his face outside. Fortunately, the members of the National Socialist Party have always known how to strictly abide by discipline. Even though Lester appeared in public, he did not suffer any accidents." It is heard that all civil servants in the city have been ordered to join the National Socialist Party, but Polish people do not believe that a coup will occur. In addition, in order to control public opinion and eliminate dissidents, the free city government has ordered the newspapers belonging to the Socialist Party and the National People's Party to suspend publication for five months and has also confiscated German newspapers published outside of Germany. Currently, the only remaining opposition newspaper is the Catholic People's Daily. Fearing that it would follow in the footsteps of other newspapers, it published a notice yesterday stating that it would not discuss the city's political issues, but the city government still confiscated it this morning. It may be ordered to suspend publication within days. It is heard that the Catholic Center Party has reported this matter to the Pope in Rome, but the responsible personnel have denied it.

<p>(Rome) It was learned here today that small-scale battles have not ceased in various parts of Abyssinia, so that Governor Graziani has had to restore the wartime organization of the Italian troops. A few days ago, Graziani disbanded 100,000 Blackshirts. However, during this rainy season, when the troops are trapped in the mud, the Abyssinians took the opportunity to launch attacks in Jima, and repeated battles have also occurred along the Jingji Railway. Therefore, the dream of easy conquest has become an illusion. Although Italian planes and infantry have assisted the pro-Italian Galla people in avenging the massacre of Mota, fierce battles are still ongoing along the railway. At the same time, according to official news, Italy has sent troops to occupy Koriubi in Harar Province. The authorities have not explained this military action, but it is generally believed that it is intended to conquer the remaining troops of General Nasibu. Reports have also come from Jibouti that fierce battles are taking place near Harar, with countless deaths. The railway from the Abyssinian capital to Dire Dawa has been destroyed, and the Italian military's transportation between the Abyssinian capital and Teshai has also been cut off.

<h3 id="e85">Resolution of the French Communist Party Congress: Support the Blum Cabinet, So That the People's Front Program Can Be Implemented, Striving to Make the Country Prosper Through Its Own Efforts <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The National Congress of the French Communist Party held its final meeting today, which lasted for a long time. In an atmosphere of excitement, it passed a resolution advocating support for the current government, so that the People's Front program can be implemented. Prior to this, representatives delivered speeches one after another, explaining the development of the party, and the closing speech was given by the party's Secretary-General, Thorez. The summaries of the representatives' speeches are as follows:</p>
<p>The representative of the Renault automobile factory workers declared that since the labor unrest occurred last month, more than 2,000 employees of the factory have joined the party. The Communist Party Secretary then presented a report stating that since last winter, the party's membership has increased to 187,205, and the number of young party members is also 65,000. "The number of people joining the party is surging across the country. Currently, only five provinces are still waiting and watching, but they will soon follow suit." A resolution was given by the British Communist Party representative on behalf of the Communist Parties of Britain, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands, stating that the French Communist Party is growing in strength, which is what the Communist Parties of various countries hope for. "Because of the Communist Party's ideology, the French people have formed a People's Front composed of leftist parties, engaged in elections, and finally won a victory. The organization of this People's Front should be emulated by various countries." Finally, French Communist Party Secretary-General Thorez declared that the party's goal is to unite all workers in the country, regardless of whether they are mental or manual laborers, or whether they are in cities or in the countryside. This effort will never stop. "Not only that, we are also willing to shake hands with Catholic workers and workers belonging to the right-wing Croix-de-Feu organization. As far as the party's ideology is concerned, we admire the Soviet Russian Bolshevik ideology and Communist Party Secretary-General Stalin, but regarding the fate of the French nation, we will never appeal to London, Berlin, or Moscow, but will seek it in revolutionary Paris and the Paris that gave birth to the Commune movement (1871). We must create a free, strong, and prosperous France." (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>(New York) The government recently built a bridge on the Hudson River in this city, named the "Triborough Bridge" (because Manhattan, the Bronx, and Queens are all connected by it). It is the world's largest vertical lift bridge, which can be raised up to twenty-four meters to allow ships to pass underneath. It is actually divided into four bridges, each paved with high-level roads to connect with each other. The bridge body is twenty-three kilometers long, of which the middle section of the pontoon bridge is four kilometers long, and the bridge surface used for lifting is 420 meters long. The total cost is 64,000,000 US dollars, and part of the cost will be repaid by collecting tolls from passing cars. The bridge has recently been completed, and President Roosevelt will personally preside over the ceremony and deliver a speech, stating that with the progress of culture and the advancement of science, the needs of mankind have also changed accordingly. "Therefore, the government's task lies in guiding these changes. Furthermore, the people need a modern government to replace the old government, just as the people need a new bridge to replace the old pedestrian orange, which is the same reason."

<p>— Special Correspondent Stone Ying</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Jinhua</p>
<p>The train continued south from Xiaoshan. The mountains on both sides undulated, beautifully strange, clear, and lovely. Looking down at the tracks, the green mountains were close by, covered with large and small black stones, very much like a group of frogs jumping and bumping into the train. Near Linpu, in the low-lying areas, there were many tombs, the coffins exposed and shallowly buried on the horizon. The shape of the tombs was slightly rectangular, while those buried on the hills were conical, dense, and tall. In the same area, there were different burial methods, which I had not seen elsewhere. The detestable Feng Shui masters were causing trouble, arbitrarily occupying usable land for the bones of the dead. The drawbacks were the same everywhere. Someone has proposed changing to cremation, which is worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>Passing Zhuji, the hometown of the peerless beauty Xi Shi, a friend sitting with me, because of military transportation, had not bought yesterday's train ticket. Hearing that he was going to miss a commercial appointment, they talked about a certain country's policy of using Chinese to control Chinese, which led them to think of Yue King Goujian's success in using a beauty trap to control the enemy. They hoped that students studying in Japan would not try exotic foods, leading to bringing spies back with them, and also causing some of their compatriots' women to be affected by the outflow of rights and interests. Hearing this, I peered out the window. The towering Zhuji Pagoda stood far away, saluting the travelers, as if representing the beautiful and affectionate Xi Shi, who had not kept the fleeting guests, but only saw them off for a distance, wishing them "Good luck all the way."</p>
<p>Zhuji also has a very famous scenic spot called "Five Waterfalls." On that uniquely steep Five Waterfalls Mountain, a huge, thunder-like roar emanates from the giant waterfall, which cascades down in five folds. Some of the waterfalls are as long as twenty fathoms, with flashes of white light that dazzle the eyes. According to the Ming Dynasty writer Song Lian's records, there were many monkeys on the mountain at that time. When tourists teased them, they would throw rocks, like rain, showing great resistance.</p>
<p>The city of Yiwu is also surrounded by mountains, but it is not like Xiaoshan, with half of it climbing up the hillside. During the Southern Song Dynasty, Zong Ze, who resisted the enemy and killed the invaders, came from here. In the Luoyang area, he repeatedly defeated the Jin soldiers, repeatedly asking Emperor Gaozong to return to Bianliang (the old capital of the Northern Song Dynasty, now Kaifeng, Henan), but Emperor Gaozong did not dare to go. This old man died of anger. In the Mancin Temple in the city, there is still a shrine to him.</p>
<p>Arriving in Jinhua, which is famous for its ham, the terrain is open, and the scenery is relatively prosperous. Even the newly built train station is said to be the best of all the stations on this line. I took a special photo, but was interfered with by the railway police, so it was done in haste, and I did not get the whole picture. After getting off the train and leaving the station, I took a rickshaw into the city. The distance of the journey has a fixed price. Walking along a gravel road for a while, I arrived at the China Travel Service Hostel. Because of the beautiful architecture and facilities, many tourists visiting the Beishan scenic spots stay here.</p>
<p>The prosperous area of the city, from Lotus Well to Xishi Street, is very lively, with the night market open until eight or nine o'clock. There are electric lights and neon lights. The streets are paved with stone, and are more than one fathom wide. The eaves of several shops can almost kiss those on the opposite side. The gravel road from the station leads directly to Zhongshan Park. The park scenery is mostly old houses, with very few flowers, trees, or clean places to rest. The reading room attached to the People's Education Hall displays the Shen Bao, Southeast, and local Zhejiang East newspapers. Because the current situation is sometimes tight and sometimes loose, there are many people vying to read them. Perhaps this is the purpose of visiting the park. In addition, there is a large string of magazines strung together with thick iron wire, very much like the medicine slips in ancient temples. I did not see anyone laboriously flipping through them. It seems that it would not be a reading room without them, but if they are set out, they are afraid that these will disappear. Although the intention is excusable, it ultimately feels very unsightly. Probably everything is being tightened, but the administrator of this room cannot tighten it. Moreover, Jinhua has developed school education and a relatively high cultural level, and needs a more complete public reading room. I think the person in charge must have a plan in mind. Recently, the urban area has been collecting and training volunteer police, with a quota of 200 people. When people voluntarily joined, there were still 100 people. Every morning, they learn "skills" at Bayongtan, and in the evening, they gather in Zhongshan Park to learn "academics" for a total of three hours. The rest of the time, they are engaged in their regular occupations. The results are very good. Judging from their intentions, the purpose is not only to prevent bandits.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway in Jinhua, customs have become increasingly extravagant. Teahouses and restaurants have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, all hiring several "tea girls" as bait to attract customers. The bad habits of the general population are spreading rapidly. Now, because drug offenses are being dealt with extremely strictly, there is hope of eradication, but the number of opium addicts is still large. Almost everyone has a cigarette in their hand. The Jinhua market has gradually declined since 1934. The main reason is the unprecedented drought that year, which greatly damaged the vitality of the farmers, resulting in a lack of purchasing power. Developed transportation has led to a loss of the position of commercial throughput. Public debt and donations have further increased the burden year by year. The former county magistrate, Li, also raised 100,000 yuan in prize-winning shares for the construction of the Beishan Highway, taking 30% as a bonus and exchanging 70% for share certificates, selling them to households for several hundred yuan, or several tens of yuan each. The country is in a state of crisis and poverty, and the people have reached the point of being squeezed to the bone. Any empty and irrelevant construction, or magnificent government offices, can only serve as embellishments in a prosperous era, and can never alleviate the national crisis in the slightest. This Beishan Highway in Jinhua is only intended to facilitate tourists to visit the scenery of the Beishan Shuanglong Cave and other places, but it has not yet been opened to traffic, but the people are burdened with debt, and everyone is complaining. In addition, the competition between various businesses is also doing its best. For example, the fees charged by the electric light company are more expensive than neighboring counties, and the conditions set are very harsh. Small and medium-sized businesses requested a reduction in fees, but because large businesses are shareholders, they tacitly disapprove, and they can only endure exploitation. In recent years, large and small burdens have accumulated for a long time, and as a result, 60 or 70 companies have declared liquidation and closure. Among them, more than a dozen companies with capital of 10,000 to more than 100,000 yuan could not avoid bankruptcy. At present, only the Jingguang textile industry is doing relatively well, followed by the ham and wine industry, and the rest are mostly struggling to survive.</p>
<p>On the street, I saw a good sign for a "Relief Society Nursery," which attracted the reporter to visit with great pleasure. Mr. Fang, the accountant of the institute, took on the task of receiving me. According to him, "The annual income of the institute, including rent, grain, and donations, is about 8,000 or 9,000 yuan. The salaries of staff, doctors, and wet nurses require 200 yuan per month." In addition to salaries, there is a surplus of 6,000 or 7,000 yuan, which, if used entirely for the poor babies, would be more than sufficient and infinitely beneficial. I saw the statistical table brought by Mr. Fang. This year, a total of 498 babies were received. In addition to those who were adopted (taken to be children, with poor households receiving a monthly subsidy of one yuan for milk and food) and those who were temporarily fostered (only milk, with a monthly subsidy of one and a half yuan), there were still 199 people in the nursery. There were only 16 wet nurses, with an average of 12 or 13 babies per person. When I asked Mr. Fang, I heard from his embarrassed mouth that there were actually only 38 babies. The other 161 little lives probably said goodbye to the world early because they were afraid of being too sorry for such a charitable organization.</p>
<p>Later, under Mr. Fang's leadership, I visited the baby rooms. Each room had several wooden beds, with three or four children sleeping in each bed. Seven or eight out of ten had large heads and thin bodies, and cried weakly. The summer mats on the beds were mostly stained blackish-brown with urine. A strange, musty odor permeated the room, which was probably the slow-acting poisonous gas of those dead babies. Inadequate nutrition was naturally the main culprit. There were also some who were sick in the infirmary. It was said that it was Sunday that day, and there were no doctors to take care of them. Only a few green-headed flies suddenly buzzed and flew around. In the midst of Mr. Fang's statement that "those sent to the infirmary are probably only taken care of in the morning and evening..." I quickly walked away.</p>
<p>Mr. Fang has served in the institute for about 20 years. According to him, the mortality rate of the babies received accounts for 70%, and those who are raised only account for 20% or 30%. Moreover, most of the sources of those who are quickly adopted are "parents are poor" and abandoned due to "a preference for sons over daughters." Therefore, female babies account for more than 90% of those received. Occasionally, when one or two boys are obtained, they are easily adopted. Most of those who adopt female babies are She people, and they also donate money because they do not have a preference for sons over daughters. George Bernard Shaw once visited a nursery in a certain country, and he said something like this: They (the babies) should be made to have a very happy and full meal, and then burned to death in a sweet dream--because this society is not theirs. Although Shaw's words are close to cruelty, the mortality rate of the Jinhua nursery proves that Shaw is exposing the cruel behavior of the old society under a mask for these countless unfortunate little lives, so that true philanthropists can find a way from the root as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the anti-Japanese troops in Guangdong and Guangxi withdrew into Hunan, their military designations were changed to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army. Because of this, a few generals had some different opinions. On the 6th of this month, Li Han-hun, the Pacification Commissioner of the Eastern District, first resigned and left Shantou for Hong Kong on the 8th. Li was originally the commander of the Sixth Division. As the Pacification Commissioner of the Eastern District, after the expansion of the army, Li was promoted to Deputy Commander of the Second Army, but he had already lost the position of Commander of the Sixth Division. He only had the nominal titles of Pacification Commissioner of the Eastern District and Deputy Commander of the Army. Therefore, Li was somewhat depressed, so he resolutely left. It is now heard that Chen Jitang has ordered Li Yukun, the Chief of Staff of the Eastern District Pacification Headquarters, to preside over military affairs in Chaozhou and Shantou. Yu Han-mou, the Commander of the First Army, was usually in southern Jiangxi, and his troops were all in southern Jiangxi. On the evening of the 4th, Yu returned to the defense on the pretext of inspecting the troops, and arrived at Huoyu on the 7th. He held a military conference at the headquarters of the First Army. On the morning of the 8th, Yu took a plane to the north. He arrived in Nanchang that afternoon for a short rest, and then went to Beijing from Nanchang to report to the central government on the military and political situation in Guangdong and Guangxi, and to attend the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. After Yu arrived in Beijing, he sent two telegrams to Guangdong, one to Chen Jitang and one to the officers and soldiers of the First Army, advising them to put the overall situation first and unite to resist the enemy. Upon receiving the telegram, Chen Jitang immediately sent Li Heling, the Deputy Director of the General Political Training Department, and Yun Zhenzhong, the staff officer of the First Army stationed in the province, to Huoyu by car on the evening of the 8th to console the officers and soldiers of the First Army. Li and Yun arrived in haste on the 9th and conveyed Chen Jitang's orders to the commanders of the First, Second, and Third Divisions, and instructed them on the plan to consolidate the defense of the Jiangxi-Guangdong border during Yu Han-mou's visit to Beijing. Therefore, there were some rumors outside. The authorities sent Zhang Meixin, the Director of the Deputy Officer's Office of the Headquarters, to the Jiangxi border on the evening of the 9th to meet Li Zhenliang, the Deputy Commander of the First Army, and Mo Xide, the Commander of the First Division, and Ye Zhao, the Commander of the Second Division, and then went to Anyuan to instruct Zhang Ruigui, the Commander of the Third Division. At present, with Yu Han-mou's visit to Beijing, rumors are rife on the Jiangxi-Guangdong border. In order to consolidate the defense of northern Guangdong, the authorities have ordered the Fourth and Fifth Divisions of the Second Army to garrison Shaoguan, Nanxiong, and Shixing. The Thirteenth Division of the Fifth Army, led by Tan Sui, and the Fourteenth Division, led by Chen Zhang, were transferred from Conghua to Yingde on the morning of the 10th to reinforce the defense. However, after Yu and Li left their posts, Huang Tao, the Director of the First Guangdong Arms Factory, Li Jiezhi, the Commander of the Humen Fortress, and Zhang Jian, the Principal of the Military Medical School, also left their posts after Yu and Li on the 10th.

<h3 id="e91">Guangdong Planes Heading North <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The pilots are students of the Sixth Class of the Aviation School; more than 20 other students have left Guangdong. Guangzhou Correspondence: A few days ago, aviation school students in Guangdong province suddenly led fighter planes north. It was found that these students were all students of the Sixth Class of the Aviation School, Classes A and B, assigned to serve in Ding Jixu's Second Air Squadron and Ao Qingyuan's Fifth Air Squadron. The Second Squadron was stationed in Guangzhou, and the Fifth Squadron was stationed in Conghua. During routine training on the morning of the 2nd of this month, seven trainees from the Fifth Squadron, Huang Zhigang, Cai Zhichang, Tan Zhuoli, Luo Chengye, Ma Weidong, and Liu Zhiying, took four Yugoslavian fighter planes and followed Squadron Leader Gu Pengnian to practice aerial combat. Unexpectedly, shortly after taking off, the four planes carrying Huang and others flew straight towards the North River. After Squadron Deputy Gu Pengnian noticed this, he immediately flew back to the Conghua squadron headquarters to report. Squadron Leader Ao Qingyuan then went to the provincial capital in person to ask Air Force Commander Huang Guangrui to punish him, and requested that planes be sent to track and intercept them. While this was being investigated, Ding Jixu's Second Air Squadron also reported that three second lieutenant pilots, Huang Jugu, Cen Zeliu, and Liao Muke, had each flown a fighter plane to the north in the morning, and had not returned to the squadron. The Air Force Command believed that the Sixth Class graduate pilots who had hijacked the planes from Guangdong belonged to the Second Squadron, and that Squadron Leader Ding Jixu should be held responsible. Ding Jixu and Zhou Yuwen, the Second Squadron's chief mechanic, were immediately detained for investigation. At the same time, Huang Pulun, the Deputy Squadron Leader of the Fifth Squadron, was also detained for questioning. After a detailed interrogation, Huang Pulun has been released, and Zhou Yuwen has also been allowed to move freely within the Air Force Command. As for Ding Jixu, his responsibility is greater, and he has been transferred to the Special Room near the police affairs section on the second floor of the Gendarmerie Headquarters. In recent days, Air Force colleagues and their families have come to visit him. If a thorough investigation reveals that there is nothing else, he should be released during the day. However, since the plane hijacking incident, the Air Force Command has immediately been placed under martial law. All officers and pilots are not allowed to leave their posts without reason, and special attention is paid to outsiders entering the unit. Visits from outsiders are declined, and the Adjutant's Office has produced a new blue badge, which will be issued from the 15th of this month to prevent spies from infiltrating. The previously issued square badges will be invalid from the 22nd of this month. It is heard that in addition to the planes that have already headed north, there are currently six air squadrons in Guangdong, and two new squadrons, the Seventh and Eighth, have been expanded.

<h3 id="e92">Japanese Joint Fleet: 72 Ships to Arrive in Xiamen; 60,000 Officers and Soldiers in Total; Japanese Ships Constantly Practicing between Taiwan, Xiamen, and Shantou <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The main force of the Japanese First Fleet and Second Fleet, with 72 ships and 60,000 officers and sailors, led by Joint Fleet Commander Takahashi, arrived in Taiwan on the 27th of last month and berthed in Keelung and Kaohsiung. After the 1st of this month, they set sail and cruised in the Japanese-controlled areas of Southeast Asia, and are scheduled to sail to Xiamen on August 1, where they will anchor for five days before sailing elsewhere. During the period of anchoring in Xiamen, sailors will land in Xiamen and Gulangyu for sightseeing. Because there are 60,000 people, Japanese merchants here are preparing to take this opportunity to do business. The empty shops on Longtou Street in Gulangyu and other city streets have been temporarily rented by Japanese merchants, who will open toy stores, antique stores, and gambling arcades. At the same time, they will print postcards of Xiamen scenery for sale. The scenery collected includes 16 types such as the Xiamen Naval Base Command, the Xiamen Naval Aviation Office, the Asahi Gakuin, the Taiwan Guild, and the Japanese Consulate. Taiwanese are also actively preparing a grand welcome. According to reports, before 1924, when former Japanese Prime Minister Okada Keisuke was the commander, he once led ships such as the Nagato and Mutsu to Xiamen for cruising. This visit is the second time. However, the last time there were only more than 30 ships, but this time there are more ships. It is truly an unprecedented event, and it is taking place in the midst of high-profile "Southward Expansion" policies of the Japanese Navy. It can be said to be a major demonstration to Southeast Asia and South China, so its significance is very great.</p>
<p>The 15 destroyers of the Japanese Fifth Torpedo Squadron have been conducting combat exercises on the waters between Xiamen, Taiwan, and Shantou since the 14th of last month, and have not stopped so far. Japanese ships often enter and leave Xiamen Port at night with absolute freedom. In addition, other Japanese ships continue to conduct exercises. In this situation, it is also worth paying attention to. (July 12)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Current Financial Situation in Fujian Province; Si Lie Will Take Office as Director of the Department of Finance; Central Government Subsidies Have Been Finalized <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since Xu resigned as Director of the Fujian Provincial Department of Finance in February of this year and Chen Ticheng succeeded him, although he has rigorously reduced staff, reduced salaries, and merged agencies, revenue still cannot meet expenditures. In less than half a year, he has accumulated debts of one million yuan. Chen could not maintain the situation. Recently, the Executive Yuan transferred Chen back to his original post as Director of the Department of Construction, and promoted Si Lie, the Administrative Commissioner of the Fourth District of the province, to Director of the Department of Finance. Si Lie came to the province from Tong'an a few days ago, met Chen Yi to ask for instructions, and then returned to Tong'an to handle the handover. He will not be able to take office in the province until mid-month. It is learned that the reason for Chen Ticheng's departure this time is half because he knew it was difficult and did not want to do it, and half because the Ministry of Finance ordered the abolition of various illegal donations and taxes, but he failed to comply due to financial difficulties, which led to repeated complaints from merchants and dissatisfaction. As for the new Director of the Department of Finance, Si Lie, what confidence does he have in this extremely difficult financial situation (according to Chen Ticheng, the current revenue and expenditure in Fujian province will differ by at least 200,000 yuan per month, no matter what)? Because he has not taken office, it is not yet known. However, Provincial Chairman Chen Yi went to Beijing this time to attend the Second Plenary Session and asked the central authorities to provide relief to the financial situation in Fujian. Yesterday, he sent a telegram to Chen Jinglie, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, saying that after entering Beijing, he had visited President Jiang, Minister Kong, and Secretary-General Weng Wenhao to report on the difficult financial situation in Fujian. All the authorities have understood and ordered that a summary of the revenue and expenditure situation in Fujian for the past five years be prepared and sent to Beijing within three days so that a relief plan can be discussed and decided.</p>
<p>The central government subsidies for the province in 1936 have been determined to be 2,656,556 yuan, divided into regular subsidies and temporary subsidies. The regular subsidies include 600,000 yuan for local subsidies, 1,440,000 yuan for education subsidies, and 116,556 yuan for judicial subsidies. The temporary subsidies include 50,000 yuan for Xiamen University, 30,000 yuan for Jimei School, and 240,000 yuan for security team subsidies. In addition, there are three main types of donations and taxes that the Ministry has ordered to be abolished, but cannot be implemented due to the inconvenience of compensating for them. One is the kerosene business tax, one is the seafood business tax, and one is the housing and land tax. Therefore, the disputes with the people are extremely fierce. In addition, the deed tax was originally set at 6% for sales and 3% for mortgages, and later reduced to 4% for sales and 2% for mortgages. Now, an additional 50% is added to fund the primary schools in each county. The special business tax (divided into tea, wood, paper, bamboo shoots, oil, sugar, seafood, and vermicelli) had previously had its tax rates reduced separately to revitalize local products. Now, a special business tax consolidation office has been established to increase tax revenue. The ordinary business tax was originally handled by each merchant guild who voluntarily paid it, but it was later considered to have abuses, and it was taken back and handled by the county governments or tax bureaus, but there was still no improvement. Now, the tax rates have been revised again, and each merchant guild is allowed to handle it in order to facilitate it. (July 11)</p>

<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since Chief Justice Tong Hang-shi of the High Court took office, he has been heavily relied upon by the higher authorities to rectify the judiciary in various places. It is now heard that Tong, in order to continue the rectification and renovation, has now drafted a central work plan for 1936. The main points of the outline are as follows: (1) Cases must be concluded within a time limit and must not be delayed to avoid disputes. (2) Prisons should be rectified, and attention should be paid to education and hygiene. (3) Diligence should be examined, and rewards and punishments should be distinguished. (4) Case files should be reorganized. If the case files in various courts and counties are not in a fixed format, they should all be reorganized within a time limit. Those that can be burned should also be cleaned up, listed, and reported. (5) Before the establishment of local courts in each county, judicial offices should be established first to ensure that the trials have an independent spirit. The selection of judges should be carefully selected in accordance with the rules set by the Ministry. It is found that judicial offices will be established in all 19 first-class counties in Fujian Province on July 1.</p>

<p>Shantou Correspondence: In order to facilitate the inspection of returning overseas Chinese, the Chaozhou Customs has specially established a luggage inspection office. All luggage and items carried by passengers arriving in Shantou by boat from other ports must be entered on a luggage declaration form. If they are not entered, it will be considered an intentional evasion of customs duties, and they will be confiscated and punished. No matter what agency or organization, they cannot intercede to take them out. They must be redeemed at the auction price. A notice was issued last month to overseas Chinese organizations, shipping companies, and ship compradores. The luggage inspection office was established on the 1st of this month. All imported passenger luggage must be inspected by the office before being released. Even old and scattered items must be taxed. Up to 80 out of 100 people entering the port must pay tax on the spot. Therefore, since the opening, tax revenue has increased greatly. Each time a ship enters the port, the luggage and items waiting for taxation are piled up like a mountain, and passengers arriving in Shantou cannot avoid waiting for one or two hours.</p>

<p>The case of the murder of the wealthy businessman Xi Wei-kun and his wife in Huayangqiao two years ago caused a sensation throughout the city. It was later discovered that Xi Wei-kun's younger brother, Xi Wei-sheng, and his concubine, Song Xiao-mei, had instigated the murder, and Shen A-he, who carried out the murder, was arrested. The county court sentenced them all to death. The defendants refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court, which upheld the original judgment. They then appealed to the Supreme Court. During the appeal, Xi Wei-sheng died in Suzhou Prison. His concubine, Xi Song-shi, was remanded to the High Court for retrial by the Supreme Court. After the witness Kai-kun was summoned again, the debate was finally concluded the day before yesterday.

<p>The female workers of the Zhoushan Wufeng Silk Factory in this county went on strike because the factory suppressed and lowered wages. They repeatedly requested the factory to increase wages, but were not granted. On the afternoon of the 12th, a portion of the female workers again requested the factory to increase wages. Because there was no result, it caused a complete strike. At that time, the workers of the nearby Ruichang Silk Factory, hearing of the previous situation, responded by going on strike together. On the one hand, they negotiated with the factory to no avail, and the stalemate could not be resolved. At the same time, the female workers of the Yongsheng Silk Factory at Xiaofenqiao outside the East Gate continued to provide assistance and stopped working together. The factory, seeing that the situation was serious and fearing accidents, closed the factory doors and prohibited entry and exit. On the one hand, it telegraphed the Public Security Bureau to request them to send troops to suppress the situation. The female workers of the Yongsheng Silk Factory, who had been deeply oppressed, took the opportunity to escape and requested assistance from the Silk Industry Workers' Union. The union sent personnel to various factories to mediate until 5 p.m., but the situation had not yet been calmed down.</p>

The text reads: "The nation is in urgent need. The Nanjing Central Party Headquarters forwarded to the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee for your consideration. All members of the central authorities have gathered in the capital for the grand opening of the conference to discuss national affairs, seek sincere unity, and plan for the safety of the party and the nation. The news has spread, and all parties are rejoicing. However, the associations, learning from the past, believe that in order to achieve the goal of sincere unity, it is necessary to urgently seek the unification of finance and military orders. Since the Ministry of Finance implemented currency reform, all provinces have followed suit. However, Guangdong and Guangxi have set up their own banners, each acting independently, leading to the failure of the entire policy to be announced as completed. The country's major plans have been mistaken in one corner, not only causing difficulties for industry and commerce. Recently, the military authorities in Guangdong and Guangxi, citing the excuse of resisting Japan, suddenly changed their numbers and crossed the border to wage war, causing an uproar throughout the country. Although our central authorities have taken measures to eliminate the trouble, this phenomenon cannot be said to be a stain on the unification of the country, nor can it be said to be an obstacle to sincere unity. The associations, observing the crux of the matter, believe that the existence of abnormal local organizations is the beginning of ambitious warlords dividing and claiming hegemony. For the present plan, we can only appeal to the conference to resolutely decide to abolish organizations such as the Southwest Executive Department and urge the Central Committee members remaining in Guangdong to come to Beijing to serve and jointly plan national affairs. It is hoped that political orders will tend towards unity and unity will be realized. Saving the nation and seeking survival is at stake, and the future of the nation is deeply dependent on it. We hope that it will be adopted. The telegraph is full of urgency and awaits orders." In addition, the First Special District City Federation telegraphed to congratulate the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, saying: "The Nanjing Central Party Headquarters is requested to forward to all members of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee for your consideration. Foreign disasters are pressing, and the national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent. Since the September 18th Incident, our government has been patient and tolerant, while the enemy has been inching forward. Today, enemy cavalry are rampant in North China, and the flames of the enemy are deepening. Smuggling everywhere is sufficient to undermine the lifeline of the nation. The evolution of the national crisis has reached the most serious juncture. How can it be that senior military leaders in Guangdong and Guangxi, driven by personal desires, dare to borrow names to destroy national unity and plunge our people into water and fire at this critical moment of national destiny? Fortunately, the central authorities have taken generous measures to convene the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee to seek a resolution to national affairs through proper channels. At this time of sweltering heat, you are either entrusted with military missions or are local officials, but you have all taken the time to come to Beijing to meet and discuss frankly and carefully study to eliminate the crux of the situation and consolidate the steps for saving the nation in order to strengthen construction and save the country from danger. The future of the country is truly dependent on it. We look forward to Beijing with our heads held high. We sincerely congratulate you. The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation bows."</p>

<h3 id="e115">Cocoon Business Tax: Ministry of Finance Has Agreed to Reduce, Still Charging 2/1000 as in the 20th Year. Zhejiang Cocoon Federation Presented to the Ministry of Finance for Compliance <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Cocoon Industry Association Federation, located in Lianzhuli, Avenue Edward VII, Shanghai, presented a document to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of reporting, it was approved by the ministry that the association's presentation on the sudden increase of the cocoon industry business tax to 5/1000, which is illegal, and requested a prompt telegram to Zhejiang to correct it. The approval was received that the presentation had been noted, and the Zhejiang Finance Department was ordered to investigate and handle it." On the 11th of this month, Zhejiang News was read, and the Ministry's instructions to the Zhejiang Finance Department stated: "Silk cocoons have always been a major product of Zhejiang Province. In recent years, foreign sales have been sluggish, and the cocoon industry has declined sharply. In the 21st year, in order to rescue the silk industry, the Zhejiang Provincial Government stipulated that the business tax rate for the industry should still be charged at 2/1000 as in the 20th year. Although the silk cocoon market has slightly improved in recent years, the decline in rural areas and the recovery of vitality are also real. Moreover, the silk cocoon business is of great importance to our international trade. The association's presentation, citing the principles of reducing and exempting business tax and the provisions of Article 4 of the measures, is not without reason. The government should promote and maintain it to alleviate commercial difficulties and benefit foreign sales. In accordance with the aforementioned circumstances, in addition to the instructions, the original presentation should be copied and sent to the department, ordering the department to refer to the established cases over the years and still charge 2/1000. Please inform them accordingly." It is evident that the ministry sympathizes with commercial difficulties and deeply feels the difficulty of exporting raw silk in recent years. The inability to compete in overseas sales is due to the excessive taxes and expenses in China, which prevent costs from being reduced. Now that Zhejiang Province has been approved to refer to the established cases over the years and still charge 2/1000 for the cocoon business tax, in this time of national financial difficulty, both sides should consider and take care of each other. All our merchants should sincerely repay, strive to donate, and mutually maintain the critical situation. In addition to notifying the cocoon industry associations by the association to inform all cocoon merchants to strictly abide by the order and collect the business tax according to 2/1000, and submit it to the respective business tax bureaus for receipt. Before the order, the reason for the cocoon industry to comply with the order and pay taxes is to submit a document to the ministry for review and implementation, which is for public convenience. Sincerely, Finance Minister Kong."</p>

<p>The New News Agency reporter learned that the Guangdong military generals were dissatisfied with Chen Jitang's actions. In addition to Yu Hanmou and many air force officers sincerely supporting the central government and having already entered Beijing, a foreign consulate in Shanghai received a report from its consul-general in Guangdong that the senior military officers in Guangdong recently gathered to hold a meeting and resolved to request Chen Jitang and his elder brother, Chen Weizhou, to retire and take the blame. Evidence from the Hong Kong telegraphs that Chen's wife, Mo Xiuying, carried valuable properties to Hong Kong indicates that Chen is likely preparing for retirement.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Customs Compiled Import Goods Marking Regulations: The Purpose of These Regulations is to Enable Each Item of Goods to be Identified Solely by its Mark and Number <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The New News Agency said that Bageisen, the Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, issued a notice No. 1527, specially compiling the regulations on marking marks and numbers for imported goods from overseas. The notice states that the measures for detailed marking of marks and numbers on the packaging of imported goods from overseas have been issued by the Customs in Notice No. 1242 on September 28, 1932, and Notice No. 1257 on November 16 of the same year. Now, because merchants often have questions about this matter and send letters requesting explanations, the current measures have been compiled into regulations as follows: (1) The purpose of these regulations is to enable each customs to easily identify each item of goods solely by its mark and number. (2) (A) All imported goods must have a mark. This mark should be a clear graphic, such as △, or at least three English letters in a group, such as KCA, or a mark formed by a combination of graphics and English letters, such as △KCA. This mark should be marked on the packaging of the goods in a non-erasable manner, either by printing, stamping, or branding. If there is no packaging, one of the above methods should be selected to mark the goods for identification. (B) For goods packed in boxes, barrels, baskets, cylindrical tubes, etc., if each item does not have a unique number that does not repeat for at least two years, then a non-repeating number or date must be added to the mark. This number can be the starting number of the batch of goods, the order number, or the date of shipment without using a number, such as △8432 △ima No 281 △1636. Other goods packed in bags or packages must have a non-repeating number or date mark or add a different mark composed of at least three English letters in a non-erasable manner. (3) In addition to marking the mark according to the measures in Article 2, each batch of imported goods must also add sequential numbers to each item, such as 10111213, etc. However, for large batches of goods, except for those packed in boxes and barrels, if each item is of the same type and weight, this sequential number does not necessarily need to be added. (4) All the following imported goods do not need to be handled in accordance with the general measures in Articles (2) and (3) above. (A) Non-boxed goods can be marked according to the following measures: angle iron, iron bars, iron bar heads, iron beams, etc. should be marked with green, white, or red paint at both ends; hoop iron should be marked with paint or tied with metal labels; steel sheets and steel plates should be marked with paint according to the measures in Article 2; various tanned hides should be printed with marks according to the measures in Article 2; pipes should be tied with linen or metal labels; various rolled ropes, linen or canvas or metal labels, wood sections should be marked with marks or numbers branded or painted on each section; iron wire and iron wire sections should be tied with metal labels; for other goods, if their nature or packaging makes it impossible to mark in a non-erasable manner according to the measures in Article 2, they should be tied with linen, canvas, or metal strips stating the appropriate mark. (B) Tinplate and other items that are exclusively for the use of importers and their agents or factories and do not need to be re-exported to other trading ports do not need to be marked with numbers again if the marks are already sufficiently clear. (C) Fresh fish, fruits, or vegetables imported do not necessarily need to be marked with numbers or have different shipping numbers marked in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 (B) above. However, these unmarked fresh goods will not be eligible for re-export benefits. (5) If goods are not marked in accordance with the measures in the above articles, they should be re-marked under the supervision of the customs. Every four hours or less than four hours, a fee of 16 yuan in national currency must be paid as usual. If two or more batches of goods, whether transported by the same ship or not, are stored in the same warehouse, and it is found that their marks and numbers are the same or substantially the same, even if they are not transported from one port and are not reported by one declarant or consignee, they must also be re-marked. Therefore, for their own benefit, merchants should pay attention to whether the marks and numbers of all goods are clear. Although the provisions of Article 2 (B) have not been fully complied with by merchants, if they are not complied with after the scheduled implementation of these regulations, they should be re-marked under the supervision of the customs and pay the fees as required. (6) If all items in a batch of goods are of the same type and weight, but only a part of them are declared, the declaration form does not need to state the number of each item, but only state that the declared goods are part of which batch, for example, 10 of 100 items in a batch of goods, that is, state (Io Packages exIot I Ioo). The above six articles are scheduled to be strictly implemented from October 12 of this year. All importing merchants should be informed accordingly. This notice is hereby issued.</p>

<h3 id="e120">This Year's Rice Grain is Expected to Have a Good Harvest: The River Rice is Gradually Dropping in Price, and the New Newly Milled Rice Will be Available in a Month. Various Provinces Have Decided to Build Grain Storage Warehouses <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The East China News Agency said that from the sowing period to the present, rice field cultivation, thanks to the government's instructions and the farmers' efforts to improve, can be expected to have a good harvest. At the same time, those who study celestial phenomena and climate speculate that there will be no severe drought this year, and the new newly milled rice can be seen in another month. Therefore, the rice price has been very stable recently, unlike the crazy rise last year, which has benefited farmers a lot.</p>
<p>Bumper Harvest of Wheat and Beans, Stable Rice Prices</p>
<p>This year, wheat, barley, and broad beans have all reported bumper harvests. In previous years, due to the poor harvest of wheat and beans, every time the green and yellow seasons overlapped, the hoarding of rice merchants and the accumulation of households would be higher than during the autumn harvest. Last year, it even rose to one-third, which was extremely harmful to farmers who worked hard all year round. Because they had to pay rent and debts after the autumn harvest, they would sell what they had harvested at a low price. By the summer, they had to rely on buying at a high price. Rice merchants and hoarding households took the opportunity to release air and raise rice prices during this period. This year, due to the bumper harvest of wheat and beans, there is no opportunity to take advantage of.</p>
<p>Proper Cultivation Methods, Rice Can Have a Good Harvest</p>
<p>This year's rice, in the provinces dredging rivers, improving technology, guiding cultivation, and removing weeds and pests, with efforts, farmers are not entirely sticking to old methods. They have reformed the technology. The early rice seedlings have been transplanted for more than three months, and the late rice has also been in place for a month. The development and growth are quite smooth, and the fields are green and lovely. Locusts and borers have also been eradicated at any time. According to research, there will be no severe drought this year, so the prospects for rice harvest are very promising.</p>
<p>Low Price of Old Rice, Large Accumulation</p>
<p>Currently, all rice and grain transactions on the market are very smooth, and prices are extremely stable. The reason for this, in addition to the above, is also because the landlords and wealthy gentry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, and Hunan provinces have accumulated a lot of grain. According to estimates from the rice and grain industry, the gentry in the interior have accumulated grain for more than three years without ever selling it. Moreover, the first batch of new rice this year can be released in just one month.</p>
<p>Provincial and County Warehouses Are Being Built One After Another</p>
<p>Currently, the provinces' agricultural warehouses are roughly divided into provincial warehouses, county warehouses, and township warehouses. Each county has two or four or five warehouses to accumulate rice, agricultural tools, agricultural fertilizers, etc. After the autumn harvest this year, the five southeastern provinces will have the latest type of warehouses.</p>
<p>Unified Authority over Grain Management</p>
<p>Regarding the unification of grain management, the Ministries of Finance and Industry have been planning for many years, but there are still no concrete measures. It is learned that there are currently two more or less close proposals: (1) The Grain Transportation and Marketing Bureau continues to operate; (2) Another Grain Transportation and Marketing Committee is formed. The difficulty lies in whether this organization belongs to the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Finance, or whether the two ministries jointly form a unit. After this issue is resolved, the authority over management can be unified. However, it is heard that, in any case, it can be resolved during the autumn harvest this year.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Jiangzhe and Zhonghui Banks Discussed Merger and Operation Under the Name of Zhonghui Bank, Effective November 2nd This Year <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, Jiangzhe Bank, organized by prominent Shanghai merchants, has been thriving since its establishment in the 20th year of the Republic of China. Last year, it even built a new building on Jiangxi Road, establishing a strong reputation. Recently, recognizing that all undertakings must unite to enhance strength and expand business, a merger was proposed. Coincidentally, Zhonghui Bank has been established for many years, with highly developed business credit and comparable assets and operations. Furthermore, there have been close personnel connections, with several individuals serving as directors and supervisors of both banks. All supported the proposal, and yesterday afternoon, extraordinary shareholders' meetings were convened separately to present the merger proposal. Shareholders of both banks unanimously approved the plan, setting November 2nd of this year as the effective date of the merger. According to the law, a three-month public notice period is required. Bank mergers are common in foreign countries, but rare in China. Now, the merger of Jiangzhe Bank and Zhonghui Bank, two major banks, is a good sign for China's financial industry, pioneering bank mergers. In the future, others will likely follow suit. It is also noted that Zhonghui Bank has a paid-up capital of 2 million yuan, while Jiangzhe Bank has a paid-up capital of 1.5 million yuan. Both banks have public reserve funds of 1 million yuan. After the merger, the capital will become 3.5 million yuan, and the business will surely develop further. The name will remain Zhonghui Bank, and all assets and liabilities of Jiangzhe Bank will be assumed by Zhonghui Bank.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Xin Zha Silk Factory Continues Strike, Party and Government Determined to Resolve with Compromise <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>According to Da Gong News Agency, thirteen silk reeling factories in the Xin Zha District, including Dafeng, Chengfeng, Hongtai, Xiexing, Yichang, Tailun, Fuchang, Dongxiang, Dacheng, Meifeng, Fuchang No. 2 Factory, Jiyu, and Jiuyu, employing both male and female silk reeling workers, demanded the restoration of the original wage of 5 jiao and 1 fen per worker. However, due to the factories' financial difficulties and lack of business improvement, this demand was not accepted. Therefore, starting on July 8th, workers from each factory left their jobs and went on strike, which has lasted for five days as of yesterday. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau convened both parties on the afternoon of July 9th for mediation, but the conditions of the two parties differed greatly, and no results were achieved. The workers of each factory, due to their unfulfilled demands, decided to continue the strike to fight for the final victory.</p>
<p>Party and Government Advice</p>
<p>After the party and government organs jointly convened both parties for mediation without success, deeply concerned that the unrest would expand and affect the factory's business, or that unrest would occur among workers in other districts, they specially dispatched cadres on the afternoon before yesterday, together with the directors and supervisors of the Shanghai Sixth District Silk Reeling Industry Association, to inform the workers' representatives and small team leaders, giving them earnest advice. However, the workers still insisted on restoring the original wage and refused to accept the unconditional return to work, their attitude being very firm.</p>
<p>Further Mediation</p>
<p>The party and government standing committee are extremely concerned about the silk factory worker unrest in Xin Zha District. A compromise solution has now been agreed upon regarding the wage portion. It is scheduled to be presented at the second mediation meeting between labor and management on July 14th to seek opinions from both parties. This solution takes into account both the factory's business burden and the workers' livelihood difficulties. If either party disagrees at that time, no further mediation will be convened, and a written order will be directly issued to both parties to be implemented in accordance with it.</p>
<h3 id="e123">China Foreign Famine Relief Committee Inspects Disaster Report of Juye and Other Counties <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The China Foreign Famine Relief Committee at 505 Henan Road previously sent Yang Yiming of the Agricultural and Water Conservancy Division to Shandong to inspect the disaster situation in various counties in order to facilitate disaster relief. The following is an excerpt from his report on the disaster situation in Juye and other counties. In Juye, the disaster-stricken area accounts for 60% of the county. Yellow River water flowing from Yuncheng caused severe damage, with the most severely affected villages being located in the northern part of the county. Except for low-lying areas such as Xue Wenji, which were unable to plant autumn crops, the remaining areas are in good condition. Insect infestations previously occurred in the autumn crops, but have now been slightly reduced, but not completely eradicated, which is still concerning. According to County Magistrate Xue Heling, the county received 200,000 yuan in disaster relief funds from various sources, including 25,000 yuan from the Yellow River Commission for city wall repair. The city wall repair work is currently underway, employing over 2,000 workers. Jiaxiang is also a heavily affected area. The Phoenix Mountain and other mountains in the county have a total of 99 peaks. The winding roads made it difficult for the Yellow River water to be discharged, resulting in a submersion lasting for seven months. The county has many high mountains and agricultural crops are not as abundant as in neighboring counties. Furthermore, the area is small and the economy is usually difficult. Since the disaster, it has been even more difficult to save itself, resulting in a barren landscape with no autumn crops planted in areas such as Niuguantun in the west and Lizhuang in the south. The scene is extremely tragic. Statistics show that the disaster area in the county accounts for 94% of the total area. There was no harvest in the wheat season this year, and only half of the autumn crops were planted. Food can only support the people until the end of the year at most, and the spring famine next year is expected. According to County Magistrate Tong Jinbiao, the county is a third-class county and is often overlooked by the outside world. Disaster relief funds received from various sources are less than 40,000 yuan, and he hopes for more relief to save lives. In the Guyuting Village and Nanyang Town area of Yutai, there was no harvest of wheat and autumn crops were rarely planted. Ruined walls and broken tiles are a sad sight, and the disaster situation is more severe than in other counties, due to the low-lying terrain and convergence of rivers. County Magistrate Yang Qidong stated that the disaster area is nearly 95% of the county, and only 60,000 yuan in disaster relief funds has been received, urgently requiring strong assistance from the outside world.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Shanghai-Bound River Rice Found to Be Hot, Reason Being Mechanically Milled Rice Contains Moisture, Rice Market Transactions Stagnant and Prices Trending Downstream <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>According to Da Gong News Agency, recently, due to the hot weather, it happens to be the busy farming season in various villages. Only twenty or so boats of river rice from the northern and southern markets arrive each day. Furthermore, the autumn harvest of grains in various production areas last year were all mechanically milled, containing moisture. During this time of extreme heat, the color easily turns black and hot. Therefore, inland merchants and boat merchants have reduced shipments, and guest merchants dare not purchase and hoard too much, fearing unexpected economic losses. Therefore, the rice market has been very quiet for days, and prices continue to trend downstream. The prices of first and second grade thin rice and broken rice have fallen by one or two jiao per dan. The future of the rice market depends on the weather turning cooler in autumn before improvement can be seen.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Japanese Resident Kayo Sei Murder Case, Rickshaw Association Offers Reward for Information on Rickshaw Puller <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Translated by Wai Lun News Agency from the Continental Daily, after Mr. Kayo Sei, an employee of the Japanese Mitsubishi Corporation in this city, was shot and killed on Qimei Road in Zhabei at 8:20 p.m. on Friday, a handgun was found near the scene of the incident yesterday morning (11th), believed to be the firearm used by the murderer. The gun was found near the roadside bushes, so the police were unable to find it immediately after the incident. It is said that the gun was manufactured in Europe and is a .32 caliber. The empty cartridges have not been found, but the bullet has been found in the deceased's head. Both the gun and the bullet will be sent to the Zhenru Court Inspection Office for official identification. Although the incident occurred in the Chinese area, it is quite close to the Di Siwei Road Police Station, so the Public Concession Police Station has agreed to cooperate fully with the Public Security Bureau to investigate the case. When reporters asked various detectives and police officers about the discovery of the handgun, they all refused to discuss it. (Omission) Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Kayo Sei's body was examined at the Feilun Road Examination Office, and a bullet was found, entering from the root of the right ear and remaining in the frontal bone. It is believed that the murderer fired at a very close distance, about three or four feet away. Next to the scene of the incident on Qimei Road is a high cement wall, so some people believe that the murderer may have hidden on the wall, but this is unlikely because the bullet entered from the root of the ear and went up to the forehead. Only one thing can be hinted, that is, the murderer must have been passing by Kayo Sei at the time. The Public Concession Police Station refuses to discuss any possible motives for this case. (Omission) Everything in Hongkou and Zhabei is as peaceful as usual. A small number of Japanese patrols were still patrolling yesterday afternoon, mostly on motorcycles. Japanese marines were stationed at the intersections of the incident.</p>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, the Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association issued a notice yesterday: For the purpose of notification, it is found that around 8 or 9 p.m. on the 10th of this month, a Japanese man in his forties, accompanied by a Japanese child in his teens, was walking in the area of the intersection of Di Siwei Road and Qimei Road in Hongkou, suddenly suffered from heatstroke and collapsed on the ground. They immediately hired two yellow rickshaws with British Concession license plates to take them to Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road for treatment. It is hoped that all car owners will inform the tenants to inquire among the rickshaw pullers. If any rickshaw pullers have pulled the car, please come to the association to describe the situation at that time, and a reward of five yuan in national currency will be paid, and there will be no other problems. This is to notify you.</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Japanese Military Attaché to China, Kita Seiichi, specially convened a meeting of Japanese military attachés stationed in China due to the visit of Wata Tokuo, the second director of the General Staff Headquarters of the country, who came to China with an important mission. The military attachés arrived in Shanghai one after another after being summoned, and began the meeting from the morning before yesterday. Wata Tokuo arrived in Shanghai on the 10th with Takahashi, the head of the China Division of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters, who had previously decided to go north from Shanghai. The meeting was continued yesterday morning at 9:00 at the residence of the Japanese military attaché on Wuding Road. In addition to Kita, Wata Tokuo, and Takahashi, Utsunomiya, Sakata (stationed in Shanghai), Imai (stationed in Ping), Amemiya (stationed in Beijing), Wata (stationed in Hankou), Usuda (stationed in Guangdong), and Ishii and Hamada, representatives of the Japanese garrison in North China, and Tamura, a staff officer of the Taiwan Army, also attended. The meeting adjourned at noon, and then reconvened at 2:00 p.m. at the Donghe Foreign Firm on Jueping Road, where Wata Tokuo was staying, and adjourned at about 4:00 p.m., thus ending the meeting. Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe hosted a banquet at his Pixun residence last night at 7:00 p.m. to entertain Wata Tokuo, Kita, and all the attendees, exchanging various opinions during the banquet. As for the content of the meeting, it is reported that the military attachés from each region reported on the situation in our country in their respective regions, and discussed the attitude of the military attachés towards diplomacy with China. This is the first formal meeting convened by Kita since taking office. Some say that the opinions of the country's military attachés and diplomats stationed in China are divided, so this meeting was convened, but its spokesperson did not recognize it. Now Wata Tokuo and Takahashi are scheduled to take the results of the meeting and return to China directly from Shanghai within a few days to report everything to the General Staff Headquarters of their military department. The other military attachés from various places will also return to their posts.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Fresh Pork Vendor Association Telegraphed Appeal to the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee to Abolish the Pig Tax Checkpoints in Five Counties of Jiangsu Province <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Chen Guo, a special commissioner for the business tax on the transportation of pigs in northern Jiangsu Province, and others, in violation of laws and regulations, openly set up checkpoints along the way, extorting money from ships. Pig merchants in various counties could not bear the burden and repeatedly telegraphed the authorities for thorough investigation. Explicit orders were also issued to correct the situation. However, Chen Guo and others not only failed to reform but intensified their actions, setting up checkpoints at every turn, with as many as twenty locations. Pig merchants in various counties, unable to endure any longer, jointly telegraphed the Shanghai Fresh Pork Vendor Association, requesting them to appeal on their behalf. The following is a transcript of the association's telegram to the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee: "To all members of the Central Executive Committee, we humbly submit a joint telegram from Xu Liu, a merchant from Nantong County, Jiangsu Province, Cong Yixing, a pig merchant from Rugao County, Zhang Yiyuan, a pig merchant from Dongtai County, and twenty-six others, stating that Chen Guo, the special commissioner for the business tax on the transportation of pigs in northern Jiangsu Province, and others, stubbornly resist laws and regulations, privately set up checkpoints, and harshly extort and collect taxes. They earnestly request that the situation be reported and a thorough investigation be conducted, strictly abolishing the original checkpoints as soon as possible to uphold the law and protect the people's livelihood. It has been found that Chen Guo, in collusion with Tang, bid on and contracted with the finance department to handle the business tax on the transportation of pigs in five counties in northern Jiangsu Province. Ignoring their avarice, they set up numerous tax checkpoints, exploiting merchants' wealth. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly appealed to the provincial government, ordering them to comply with the ministry's order, handle the matter according to the established practice of payment by the trade. On May 14th of this year, the Ministry of Finance issued telegram No. 4152, stating that it had previously received telegrams requesting that the Jiangsu Provincial Government be consulted to order the department to maintain the established practice of payment by the pig trade and to explicitly eliminate the illegal and excessive taxation by contractors. The Jiangsu Provincial Government had been consulted accordingly, and the Ministry's repeated consultations had been forwarded for compliance. The Jiangsu Provincial Government's document No. 105, dated April 28th of this year, stated that the case had been previously reported to the province by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and the special commissioner for the business tax on the transportation of pigs in northern Jiangsu Province had been repeatedly instructed to handle the matter carefully in accordance with regulations and not to set up checkpoints for extortion, causing harassment. The previous reasons were approved, and it was further instructed to comply with regulations. This was duly consulted and replied. It was approved that a telegram should be sent to inform, etc., and duly delivered to the association. Upon receiving this, the merchants celebrated, hoping that the tribulation of taxes would be removed and that there would be a chance for recovery. Unexpectedly, for a month, Chen Guo and Tang refused to comply and continued to illegally collect taxes and extort as before. The provincial government's clear orders were treated as mere formalities. Their arrogance and stubborn resistance were beyond words. Historically, pig tax has been collected at various ports along the river when pigs are exported and sold. There has never been the harm of inland checkpoint taxation. In October of the 21st year of the Republic of China, the Rugao Business Tax Bureau, with a whimsical idea, privately established tax checkpoints in Dingyan, Matang, Baipu, and other places in the interior to collect pig tax. Merchants publicly elected representatives to petition in Beijing and the province. The provincial department explicitly ordered the immediate abolition of the checkpoints and changed the pig tax to the business tax on the transportation of pigs in five counties in northern Jiangsu Province, entrusting Special Commissioner Lou Fumin to manage it and imitating the original port collection in northern Jiangsu. On November 26th of that year, the special commissioner received an explicit order from the provincial department to abolish the tax checkpoints in Matang, Baipu, etc. In May of the 23rd year, after Chen Guo contracted, he dared to reinstate the Dingyan, Matang, and Baipu checkpoints that had been explicitly abolished and added tax checkpoints in Liqiao, Maqiao, and other places that had not been subject to checkpoints for hundreds of years, repeatedly blocking and harshly extorting transit taxes. Dozens of businesses have been bankrupted by their power. Among the five counties in northern Jiangsu, only Tongzhou has a special situation. All pigs coming to Tongzhou must pass through Dingyan, Matang, Baipu, Liqiao, Maqiao, and other places. The tax cannot be unified and collected according to the established practice of payment by the trade, so that the same tax has different routes. Moreover, when pig boats arrive at the checkpoints, they are deliberately delayed. The checkpoint staff may not be up early, or they may be out late. There are also times for eating, resting, entertaining, caulking the hold, counting, and issuing tickets. If the tax checkpoint is short even a small amount, the merchants are forced to travel dozens of miles to borrow money to make up the difference. Pigs are fresh goods. Once they are blocked and delayed, they are easily injured or die, which is a significant matter. In the past, when taxes were paid by the trade, the trade would advance all payments, avoiding all kinds of difficulties along the way. Since the implementation of checkpoint taxation and extortion, not only has the trade stopped, but laborers who rely on pigs to maintain their families, such as sand boat workers on the Yangtze River, barge workers on inland rivers, and cart drivers who push pigs, number over ten thousand. The impact will lead to starvation. Blocking pig boats coming to Tongzhou on the main waterways and extorting taxes has gradually cut off our livelihoods. There are no checkpoints on the rivers of Rugao, Taixing, Jiangdu, and Jingjiang. Why do they exclusively antagonize Tongzhou, abuse our pig merchants, and trample on our lifelines? The unequal treatment is intolerable in law and reason. Moreover, Chen Guo, in collusion with Tang, has colluded with corrupt officials and owes more than 30,000 yuan in contracted tax payments, using this as a means to seek renewal of the contract. The annual pig tax is over 180,000 yuan, deceiving those above and below, with insatiable desires. They even further increased the tax rate, pests that harm the people, worse than snakes and scorpions. If you do not believe it, please send personnel to investigate the number of pigs sold daily by the Shanghai Fresh Pork Trade Association from May 21st of the 22nd year to May 21st of the 24th year and verify the allocation of expenses for river protection vessels from each trade. There is no error. The merchants felt a chill upon hearing the wicked names of these people. When they contracted the pig tax in Tongzhou, they all cried out in pain and hatred. From then on, the lives of our families were entirely in the hands of these poisonous people. Like mercury falling to the ground, they infiltrated everywhere, and now everything has become a reality, clearly verifiable. Such coercion and violation of the law undermine the credibility of national policies. The merchants have suffered abuse and hardship, finding themselves in a situation of nine deaths and no life, in a place where they can no longer endure. They have no choice but to cry out and appeal for relief. In addition to enclosing a map of the port and river tax checkpoints and a copy of the former Special Commissioner Lou's original order abolishing the Dingyan, etc., tax checkpoints, we urgently request your association to investigate and relay the appeal, strictly ordering the business tax on the transportation of pigs in northern Jiangsu Province to comply with provincial orders as soon as possible, abolishing all illegal tax checkpoints in Dingyan, Matang, Baipu, Liqiao, Maqiao, etc., and dismissing and prosecuting Chen Guo and Tang, appointing virtuous officials to take over, to relieve public anger and uphold the law. This is indeed a matter of public justice. It is approved that Chen Guo, the special commissioner for the business tax on the transportation of pigs in northern Jiangsu Province, and others, illegally collect taxes and privately set up checkpoints along the way, extorting money from ships. This association has repeatedly received letters from pig merchants in various counties requesting us to appeal on their behalf. We have relayed their appeals to the Ministry of Finance and the Jiangsu Provincial Government for thorough investigation. Subsequently, we received instructions to comply with the legal tax rate and not to impose excessive taxes. However, the business tax on pigs in northern Jiangsu has not only not been corrected, but checkpoints are still set up to intercept ships and collect taxes as before. Moreover, the practice has intensified, with checkpoints set up at every turn, with as many as twenty locations (see attached map). This is truly appalling. Article 3 of the Business Tax Law states that all businesses subject to business tax should provide the following information and apply for a business tax investigation certificate: item 1 specifies the type of business, store name, and location. However, very few pig merchants have stores. The source of pigs is mostly small purchases from farmers or wholesale purchases from pig traders, which are then transported to various ports for sale. To collect taxes from those who have not set up stores contradicts the Business Tax Law, which stipulates that taxation only occurs where stores are opened. Furthermore, Article 7 of the same law states that business tax may be collected annually, semi-annually, or quarterly, depending on the circumstances considered by the provincial and municipal governments. However, short-term business taxes may be collected monthly in accordance with the provisions of Articles 3 to 6. Even if pig merchants have an obligation to pay business tax, it should be collected annually or quarterly. If it is considered short-term in nature, it can be changed from quarterly to monthly. There are no other changes to the collection method. However, the business tax collection office for pigs in northern Jiangsu Province arbitrarily sets up checkpoints along the way, intercepting ships and collecting taxes daily. This contradicts the Business Tax Law. Furthermore, the fourth of the five items in the national financial conference proposal for reorganizing business tax clearly stipulates that business tax should not be collected on goods, and the principle of collecting tax on employment should be applied. The practice of collecting business tax similar to transit fees on goods should be abolished. The original methods of merchant associations assisting in collection, contracting, and apportioning among industries should be reformed by local authorities. The fifth item in the plan for reorganizing local finances stipulates that taxes that obstruct traffic or are levied on goods or boats passing through should not be collected. This is the third contradiction. Now, the collecting commissioner not only violates business tax laws and regulations but also acts arbitrarily, setting up checkpoints to intercept ships and collecting multiple taxes on the same item, which is particularly illegal. Since the nationwide abolition of transit fees was announced, except for those with specified tax rates to compensate, no taxes may be levied on goods within the same territory. This is explicitly prohibited by Article 612 of the Code. However, within the same jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province, checkpoints are set up at every turn to intercept ships and extort multiple taxes on the same item. This illegal and chaotic government is deeply shocking. The original cause is the undesirable system of reporting, bidding, and contracting by businesses. Those who bid seek to be selected, competing with high prices. The higher the price, the more severe the exploitation of merchants. Once selected, they disregard laws and regulations and do not understand the overall situation, only knowing to maximize profits. Merchants and the people cannot bear the burden, and the pig trade is directly harmed. Farmers are indirectly affected. At a time when all industries are declining and rural areas are bankrupt, maintaining recovery is already precarious. There is no reason for the existence of this undesirable contracting system, private establishment of transit fees, and illegal harassment. Moreover, Jiangsu Province is close to the capital, and government orders cannot be implemented. Remote areas will be even less likely to comply. Now, at the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, wise elders of the party and the nation are gathered, promoting benefits and reforming currencies. All people look forward to this. In order to maintain the lives of millions of pig merchants and farmers, this association dares to submit a map of the tax checkpoints set up along the way in various counties of northern Jiangsu, the Ministry of Finance's instructions, and a copy of the instructions of the former special commissioner for the business tax on the transportation of pigs in northern Jiangsu Province, requesting discussion and instruction to the competent authorities to immediately abolish the tax checkpoints along the way, severely punish illegal officials, to relieve pig merchants from their distress and save the people's livelihood from death. The Shanghai Fresh Pork Vendor Association bows in anticipation of your urgent decision.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Inspection of Tea Production Areas in Qimen and Tunxi Completed One After Another All Inspection Personnel Returned to Shanghai Successively Inspection of Other Production Areas to be Implemented Next Year <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>In order to ensure the superior quality of tea, the Ministry of Industry, in addition to improving tea inspection standards and improving tea boxes, implemented tea production area inspection. The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau took charge of this endeavor. This year, the process started from the Qimen black tea area and the Tunxi green tea area. The Qimen black tea area production area inspection was headed by Wu Juenong, the director of the tea inspection team of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, and was completed last month. The Tunxi green tea area production area inspection was headed by Fan Hejun and started at the beginning of last month. Now the inspection is also complete, and all inspection personnel have returned to Shanghai in succession. It is also reported that the inspection of other tea production areas will be implemented starting next year.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Anhui Native Association in Shanghai Petitions: Wuyuan County Should Be Under the Jurisdiction of Anhui <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Anhui associations in Shanghai telegraphed the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, stating: "In order to continue to petition that Wuyuan be returned to the jurisdiction of Anhui, we implore your review and approval to comply with public opinion." The case of Wuyuan being placed under the jurisdiction of Jiangxi has been met with group petitions by public organizations in Wuyuan and fellow natives in other provinces and counties since the explicit order was issued. The relevant authorities were petitioned to not consider the matter, but the request was not granted. After the takeover, it was argued that the original decision was made by the Central Political Conference and could not be changed without review and relief from the highest authority. Therefore, this association and others successively petitioned the Fifth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee, the Sixth Plenary Session, and the Fifth National Congress, requesting re-examination and transfer to the National Government, requesting that Wuyuan be returned to the jurisdiction of Anhui. The above is a general outline of the case's history. Wuyuan has a long history of belonging to Anhui, and its people, language, customs, lifestyle, and environment are the same as those of the five counties of Huizhou. Whether viewed from a political, livelihood, or cultural perspective, there is no need for the change of jurisdiction. Native associations in various locations have spoken in great detail about this, filling numerous volumes, which shows the will of the people. It is believed that the government's important reason for declaring the change of jurisdiction was to facilitate the suppression of bandits, which was only a temporary measure. Now, several years have passed, and the bandits in the neighboring counties of Jiangxi have been cleared, but Wuyuan is still plagued by bandits and has not been stabilized. It would be better to still be under the jurisdiction of Anhui, together with the other five counties of Huizhou, under the guidance of the Tenth District, to cultivate self-defense and assist the garrison troops. As for other details, previous decisions and documents have been repeatedly stated. Now they are compiled into a volume and attached to the document. We implore your review and approval to return Wuyuan to the jurisdiction of Anhui to comply with public opinion. We are extremely apprehensive and await your decision. Respectfully submitted to the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, with one volume of compiled documents attached.

<p>The Da Gong She reported that Jingda, Tongyi, and other refined salt companies petitioned the Ministry of Finance to abolish the re-levied public welfare surcharge on salt in Beijing. Recently, the Ministry of Finance established a new item, re-levying an extra-legal public welfare surcharge of 6 jiao, 6 fen, and 5 li per dan on salt in Beijing. After receiving the order, the Xiaguan Manufacturing and Inspection Bureau posted notices everywhere, implementing the measure immediately. However, the refined Huai salt shops in Beijing believed that this would burden the people and the business, and based on the Provisional Constitution and various laws and regulations, the people had no obligation to pay this extra-legal and harsh re-tax. They jointly requested the Ministry of Finance to suspend the tax.</p>

<p>The Da Gong She reported that Zhang Naiqi, the deputy manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, resigned to the bank's board of directors a few days ago. Li Fusun, the chairman and general manager, personally and sincerely tried to persuade Zhang to stay. It is said that Zhang's attitude was quite firm and he did not express any intention to withdraw his resignation. According to a Da Gong She reporter, after resigning, Zhang intends to retire in Shanghai and focus on writing about international diplomacy, economics, and other topics, with no intention of going elsewhere for the time being. The position of deputy manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank that he left behind is currently being temporarily held by General Manager Li. However, the bank's operations are heavy, and the position of manager of the Shanghai branch should not be vacant for too long. A successor is currently being carefully selected and will soon be submitted to the board of directors for discussion and decision.</p>

<p>The Shen Shi She reported that according to a leading figure in the industrial sector, the development of China's chemical industry is very recent. Therefore, compared with advanced countries, it is not enough to follow their lead. The chemical industry can be roughly divided into heavy industry, light industry, and the alcohol industry. Chemical heavy industry includes the manufacturing of munitions, pigments, pharmaceuticals, enamel, celluloid, soda water, soap, monosodium glutamate, etc. The most important raw materials required are sulfuric acid and ammonia. The first company in China to manufacture these chemical raw materials was the Pacific Alkali Company in Tianjin. Later, the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy also set up a factory to manufacture sulfuric acid. With the establishment of the Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant, the domestically produced raw materials like hydrochloric acid, caustic soda, salt chemicals, and lime began to make important advancements, recovering a considerable amount of leakage. Chemical light industry factories, due to their lighter capital requirements, have been set up in China in countless numbers. The largest chemical alcohol industry is the China Alcohol Factory, a joint venture between the Ministry of Industry and the overseas Chinese Huang Jiangquan. There is also the Meilong Alcohol Factory, which is also well-equipped. However, because China needs more than 225 million kilograms of chemical alcohol annually (according to customs import statistics), the output of the two factories is still insufficient to meet demand. It is reported that the Academia Sinica has now established a specialized research department for the alcohol industry, which may be of great benefit to the general chemical industry in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Ningbo Native Association Sends Letter to Yin County Government Itemizing Methods for Relocating Graves <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai sent a letter to the Yin County Government yesterday regarding the relocation of graves, and itemized three methods. The following is a transcription: We are writing to you, the Yin County Government, in response to your previous official letter regarding the overall plan for reorganizing graves. We were entrusted with presenting the opinions of our fellow villagers so that they could be adopted as much as possible within the scope of the law when drafting the plan. This demonstrates the Yin County Magistrate's earnest desire to seek the hidden desires of the people. Our association members have repeatedly held meetings and discussions, summarizing the opinions of our fellow villagers and formulating three practical methods. We have prepared another letter and pray that they be adopted in your proposed overall plan. We are deeply grateful. Furthermore, regarding the actual implementation in various towns and townships, there are things that we must ask for special attention. The customs of our Ningbo people place great importance on ancestral graves. The heads of various towns and townships must, while implementing laws and regulations, extremely respect existing customs, so that implementation is beneficial and does not cause disputes. For example, the Yin County Coffin Burial Office has been demolishing and relocating floating coffins for more than ten years, and there has been no local objection at first, because the deadline was relatively generous and the procedures were cautious. The office urges the relocation of floating coffins in stages and phases, marking each grave to be relocated so that the grave owner can know at a glance. Those who voluntarily relocate and request an extension are always granted. This is one point. For graves that are relocated on behalf of the owners, they are numbered and listed when relocated to facilitate identification. Coffins are never opened unless they are so decayed that they cannot be moved, in order to prevent theft of burial objects. This is the second point. Recently, various towns and townships have been handling graves uniformly, setting extremely short deadlines. When people go to register, there is no one in charge. When demolishing and relocating, they rely on earthworkers to profit from their income, calculating prices per grave and focusing on profit. The beginning is not good, and the abuses are growing, causing widespread criticism. If they can be ordered to follow the methods of the burial office, there will be many remedies in practice. Therefore, we have attached one or two suggestions and pray that you will examine and implement them. This is what we hope for. Respectfully submitted to Yin County Magistrate Chen.</p>
<p>Three Suggestions The association's itemized suggestions for reorganizing graves: (1) Various towns and townships must first complete the establishment of public cemeteries and public burial grounds before urging the relocation of floating coffins in the towns and townships and prohibiting the construction of graves on cultivated land. On June 2nd of this year, the Hangzhou Southeast Daily reported on a news item about Hangzhou requesting a ban on private cemeteries, which can be used as a reference. (2) According to provincial orders, whether a long-buried grave should be relocated depends on whether it interferes with hygiene, transportation, or land use. Long-buried graves do not pose a hygiene problem. The relationship between transportation and land use should also have clear standards to be followed. For graves along railways and highways that are deemed to be demolished, the distance standards should be explicitly defined in laws and regulations and announced in advance to avoid making the grave owners feel at a loss. (3) In Yin County's single-handed method of registering graves, it is not clearly stated whether the term "grave" refers specifically to the grave itself or includes the coffin. The method of public announcement is also not clearly defined. Article 3 of the provincial supplementary methods states that even if a deadline is set, the principle is not to relocate on behalf of the owners, and an extension should still be publicly announced. However, the registration method only sets a one-year deadline, and those who do not register after the deadline will be treated as ownerless and relocated to Yishan on their behalf. All should be revised in accordance with the supplementary methods. As for the method of requiring grave owners to fill in the registration number on the corner of the grave after registration, it is also not comprehensive. It should be changed to have the township office mark each grave to be relocated in advance, following the method of the county burial office demolishing and relocating floating coffins. This would be more thorough.</p>

<p>The Shanghai West National Goods Exhibition has been exceptionally well-attended since its opening on the tenth. Because of its convenient location in a densely populated area, the public have been eager to visit. Especially from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM each evening, the exhibition has been packed. The visitors at the temporary bazaar, where people select and purchase national goods for trial use, have been particularly crowded. Therefore, national goods factories are continuing to request to participate in the exhibition. In the past three days, more than a dozen factories have applied to join the exhibition, including Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors Factory, Continental Cotton Weaving Factory, Yading Knitting Factory, Huasheng Rubber Factory, Guang Quan Silk Scarf Factory, and Hengchang Towel Factory. In order to expand publicity, the exhibition printed more than a dozen slogans yesterday and distributed them in the rural areas of western Shanghai. Within a few days, the exhibition will require each factory to select two employees, hire a band, and hold a lantern parade rally. All the lanterns, decorations, and flags have been prepared. Regarding fire prevention, the exhibition has requested the Caoxiadu Fire Brigade in western Shanghai to provide constant vigilance and has also displayed 20 chemical foam fire extinguishers from the Shanghai China Industrial Factory throughout the exhibition hall. This is to prevent fire and to serve as an exhibit. Regarding security, Tan Baoshou, the chief of the Caoxiadu Public Security Bureau, sends police officers to maintain order at the exhibition hall every day. Regarding hygiene, in addition to sending workers to spray disinfectant in the toilets, sewers, and waterways at all times, the exhibition has prepared a special car to transport people to the hospital in case of heatstroke or sudden illnesses. The exhibition also gives away Rendan from the Sino-French Pharmacy, Sha Yao Shui, and Liangdan from the Wuzhou Pharmacy, and Tiangong Ten Drops Water every day. The exhibition's temporary bazaar has rules for security staff.</p>
<p>Yellow Sea Cyclone Strikes Shanghai's Heatwave Disappears More Extreme Heat in Two to Three Days</p>
<p>Shanghai's weather has been extremely hot in recent days. However, after the end of the rainy season yesterday (the twelfth), the heat gradually dissipated. Since the morning, cool breezes have blown, slightly dispelling the summer heat. Although the sky was clear, the scorching sun did not wreak havoc. The general public speculated that a hurricane was coming. However, according to the observatory, the northeasterly winds yesterday were caused by a cyclone in the Yellow Sea, which was accompanied by low pressure passing through this area and moving northeast. Therefore, the sky was cloudy all day. No hurricane was found in the Yellow Sea or East China Sea. Based on this observation, it can be avoided that Shanghai is hit by a hurricane. Furthermore, the season is approaching the beginning of the dog days, and there will be more extreme heat in two to three days.</p>

<h3 id="e138">The Murder Case in Liuzao Town, Nanhui, Transferred to Shanghai for Trial. Ma Shouren's Stolen Boat, Shen Shuiliang Tragically Died. <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Ma Shouren, the owner of Ma Yilong's store and the richest man in Liuzao Town, Nanhui County, along with Shen Shunkui, a clerk in the town, and Zhou Xinqiao, Wang Wenbiao, and Gu Chuntao, members of the local merchant corps, and Huang Yifu, the chief of the Liuzao police (Huang was not brought to justice), were accused by Shen Lu, the wife of the Shen family in Shenjia House, north of Shenjia Stone Bridge, along with her daughter-in-law Shen Zhou, in the Jiangsu High Court. The accusation was that on December 23rd of last year, at around 3:00 PM, Ma Shouren falsely accused her son, Shen Shuiliang, of theft and caused him to be murdered while being escorted, pushed into the river to hide the traces, and that the original county trial was suspected of being biased. The Jiangsu High Court ruled that the Shanghai District Court would be the first court to accept the case. Yesterday, the Nanhui County Government had already transferred the entire case file to the Shanghai Court Procuratorate for investigation and ordered both parties to submit themselves. The facts of the incident and the reasons relied upon by both parties are recorded as follows. Ma Shouren is the wealthiest man in Liuzao Town. The incident stemmed from the theft of a small boat. On December 23rd of last year, at 3:00 PM, Shen Shuiliang, 26 years old, who had been a carpenter, was arrested by Wang Wenbiao, Zhou Xinqiao, and other members of the local merchant corps. According to the merchant corps' record, Shen Shuiliang had confessed to stealing the boat, but the family of the deceased claimed that he was tortured to confess. On the same day, late at night, Jin Shiying, a cook from the local public security bureau, and Qian Shaolin, Zhou Xinqiao, Wang Wenbiao, and Min Shusheng, members of the merchant corps, pretended to escort him to recover the stolen goods. On the way, they strangled Shen with a rope and threw his body into the river, intending to frame someone else. However, according to the defendants, while going to recover the stolen goods, when Shen Shuiliang reached the Chenjia Bridge, west of Bazao Port Bridge, Shen Shuiliang, fearing punishment, jumped into the river to escape, but because his hands were tied, he drowned and they were unable to rescue him. Later, the public security bureau reported to the general bureau, which forwarded it to the county government. Judge Jiang and the coroner went to examine the body. According to the report, the deceased had three rattan marks near the right side of his back, about an inch long and slightly slanted, slightly blue and swollen. His right arm had two rattan marks, both with broken skin and blood stains. Both wrists had rope marks near the top, and the throat also had rope marks. The coroner's report and autopsy were taken by the family of the deceased and photographed, which they used to file a lawsuit, claiming that the rattan marks on the body proved non-criminal torture, the rope marks on the wrists proved the state of being tied, and the rope marks on the throat were evidence of strangulation. They also claimed that when the body was recovered, the abdomen was not swollen, indicating that he fell into the water after death. On the other hand, the defendants did not admit to the injuries all over the body, and claimed that there was no strangulation. They said that strangulation would require breaking the windpipe. The dispute was brought to the county government, causing a sensation throughout the county. After the incident, Ma Shouren was detained for the New Year, and was later released on bail with 1,000 yuan in cash and 1,000 yuan in written guarantee. Shen Shunkui was released on bail with a 500 yuan shop guarantee, and Zhou Xinqiao and Wang Wenbiao were each released on bail with 300 yuan shop guarantees. The dispute has lasted for seven months and has not been resolved. Both sides insist on the points of dying after falling into the river and falling into the river before dying, which is the focus of the dispute. The public opinion is also not very favorable, so the case was submitted to the Jiangsu High Court to transfer jurisdiction to the Shanghai District Court. Yesterday, the deceased's mother, Lu, and the deceased's wife, Zhou, arrived at the court with a four-year-old orphan. The defendants were Ma Shouren, Shen Shunkui, Zhou Xinqiao, Wang Wenbiao, and Gu Chuntao. Chief Prosecutor Zhong Shangbin transferred the case to Li Xulin, the newly appointed prosecutor, for investigation and instructed him to be cautious. After the preliminary hearing, Ma Shouren was required to provide two additional substantial shop guarantees, and the others were also required to provide security guarantees, pending investigation.

<h3 id="e139">The City's Tiger Stoves Have Not Increased Prices, but the Water Prices Among Businesses Are Inconsistent. The Price of Tofu Is Chaotic After the Price Increase. <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The residents of this city mostly rely on hot water shops (commonly known as tiger stoves) for hot water. Due to the dense population of the city, the number of hot water shops is quite large, no less than several thousand, scattered throughout the streets and alleys. Recently, there were rumors that the industry would raise prices after the increase in tofu prices. Yesterday, according to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, after inquiring from the industry, this was not true. The reason is that the industry does not yet have a trade association organization, and the prices are mostly determined independently. In the concession area, the general price for hot water is two to three scoops per copper coin, while in the city area, it is three to four scoops per copper coin, which is very inconsistent. If prices are to be increased, it is necessary to start with unifying water prices. Since water prices are not yet uniform, price increases are out of the question. It was also learned that after the tofu industry raised prices on June 1, the prices are still chaotic. Not only is there no consistency between the special zone and the city area, but the prices in the South City and Zhabei are also different. The industry association originally had an organization to regulate market prices, but recently, due to difficulties in collecting membership fees, the members have not been attending meetings, so there is no way to rectify the situation.</p>

<p>At around 10:00 PM last night, a man suddenly arrived at the Central Hotel at 545 Guangdong Road, leading a boy of about fifteen or sixteen years old. He claimed to be named Yang Jixian, 42 years old, from Songjiang. The boy was said to be his son. He wanted to open a room, and the porter led him to the fourth floor and booked room 409 for lodging. Unexpectedly, at 10:30 PM, Yang Jixian jumped from the fourth-floor window and committed suicide. He fell to the street, his skull was shattered, and his arms and legs were broken. A western policeman from No. 71 saw it and reported it to the fire brigade, which sent an ambulance to take him to Renji Hospital for treatment. They also investigated the room. Later, his son was taken to the police station. It is said that there was also a suicide note, which was also taken away by the police. Yang Jixian died at 11:00 PM due to his serious injuries, despite medical treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e141">A Midsummer Afternoon Trip—Impressions of the Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Special Article from This Newspaper. A friend who recently came to Shanghai from Peiping said that he once asked a lady who had just returned from playing in Shanghai:</p>
<p>"Now that you've come from Shanghai, can you tell me what Shanghai is really like?"</p>
<p>"Well, Shanghai?" The lady replied with an obvious look of disappointment, "I can't see anything new. I just feel that there are houses everywhere. Outside the houses are roads, and the roads are full of people!"</p>
<p>Indeed, even those who are used to living in Shanghai have this feeling. Every day they open their eyes, their bodies are in the house, and there are already many people in the house who have the same thoughts as themselves. They run from home or the office onto the road, and the streets are full of people, even more than in the house. Repeating this back in the house, they meet people again. Shanghai's land is narrow, the houses are small, and the people are many. This Peiping lady's description is quite adequate.</p>
<p>In the summer, these three aspects of Shanghai—narrow land, small houses, and many people—make people feel particularly fearful, except for the very few privileged class. So, on a certain afternoon when the indoor temperature was as high as ninety-six degrees, I accompanied my friend from Peiping, whom I mentioned at the beginning, to Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach, braving the heat.</p>
<p>We were already on the ferry. The water in the Huangpu River was as turbid as flowing cement. The sun was shining directly at noon, a sun that was motionless and stifling, steaming the river water, and a smell like that from a hot oil pot came out of the rippling waves. We sat in the cabin for a while, and felt the sweat on our backs had gone from damp to dripping. So, we took off our long clothes, held light fans—in fact, the fan in my friend's hand was a palace fan with carvings of imperial poems on the ribs, measuring one foot two or three inches long. We walked out of the cabin, picked two canvas chairs on the deck, and sat facing the bow. A bell rang on the boat, and the ship slowly left the dock. The noisy sounds on the shore gradually faded away, until we could no longer distinguish whether the person sitting on the rickshaw was male or female. The ferry had already sailed towards the center of the river, heading north.</p>
<p>Gusts of river wind, although somewhat like they were blowing out of a kitchen or bathroom, could not resist the continuous blowing, and the sweaty backs and canvas chair backs no longer stuck together. The large fan in my friend's hand had already been folded and held in his hand. He gently tapped his thighs and palms. On such a hot afternoon, he had an attitude of leisure like a "clear wind and bright moon" night. I'm afraid you wouldn't find this kind of person even in a room with air conditioning.</p>
<p>Looking closely, there were a dozen canvas chairs around. Several foreigners were sitting there, pointing at both banks of the river, chatting casually. The wind blew over the head of a Western lady, and strands of golden hair hung down beside her black and round sunglasses. She raised her hand and brushed them to the side, and stretched her neck and shook her head. We looked again at the empty canvas chairs, leaned our heads back, and rested as leisurely as possible.</p>
<p>Many cargo ships from foreign countries were moored in the river. Cranes were lifting bundles of goods, some unloading, some loading. The laborers, stripped to the waist and covered in a shiny layer of sweat, were busy working under the sun. Our ferry passed by the side of the ships, and we heard the rumbling of the steam engines driving the cranes, sometimes near, sometimes far, sometimes continuous, sometimes intermittent. Several cargo ships had already passed by us.</p>
<p>After passing Xidu, Donggou, Qingning Temple... the ferry was busy turning, docking, reversing, and going forward. Suddenly, my friend pointed to a huge white ship rushing forward behind the stern and told me to look at the name of the ship next to the keel. In an instant, the two ships were sailing side by side. The ship looked to be about 20,000 tons, all white, with green near the waterline. The white waves split to the left and right sides of the hull. The steady, confident, and proud figure seemed to be reigning over the Huangpu River, looking around with pride. I looked closely at the bow and knew that the ship was named "Filex Roussel," a French mail ship. My friend had lived in Europe for a long time and was experienced in traveling. He said, "Don't just admire her current stability and leisure on the river. Once she reaches the Indian Ocean, if she encounters bad weather, she will be tossed around like a basket. Moreover, once she reaches the Mediterranean, the stifling heat is far worse than our comfort on this ferry!"</p>
<p>The ship arrived at Gaoqiao, we got on a public bus, and in less than twenty minutes, we arrived at the seaside bathing beach. I was revisiting an old place. I already had a good idea of the general situation there. My friend, however, was visiting for the first time, and he couldn't help but miss things while looking around. He told me afterwards that he had originally thought that this seaside bathing beach would just be a Shanghai slang term for "a showy affair," but he didn't know that there was actually a beach. Although it couldn't compare to the grandeur of Qingdao and Dalian, it was much better than a cement-paved swimming pool. There was also a large dining hall, a small garden, a thatched hall, and yurts, where you could swim, fish, and rest. His final conclusion was, "It's quite impressive!" He undoubtedly revealed his personality in his satisfaction.</p>
<p>We first sat in the thatched hall by the beach for a while, sipping some ice water. The atmosphere of the sea enveloped our whole bodies, and gusts of sea wind continued to attack us. Unable to withstand such internal and external cooperation, a heart full of煩熱, had long since vanished. My friend even rented a swimsuit and really took a proper seawater bath. I ran along the beach for a while, looking at the blue and white striped awnings in the north. Further up the shore, there were dozens of small houses in a row, with green gauze windows, and some miscellaneous trees planted in front. The front faced the sea, and the back was full of fields and vegetable gardens. I thought to myself, seeing this scene under the scorching sun was already quite cool. If I could really stay here for a night or two, lying in the dark night and listening to the sound of the tide in the sea, plus a lot of cool wind, and far away, a few whistles of night航, would I need to cover myself with a thin cotton blanket? Thinking of this, I couldn't help but feel a chill in my heart, so I turned back, walked past the sprinkler of the shower, and saw four young girls of similar stature lined up waiting to be photographed. Their laughter broke my "chill." I thought I'd better go see my friend, so I walked towards the beach, where the wind was really lovely, blowing in from my sleeves and trouser legs, and I suddenly swelled up and became plump. At this moment, I passed the small pavilion that rented out swimming toys, and there were several hollow rubber people hanging there. Their "empty appearance" was somewhat similar to my clothes shell that had been blown up by the wind. Just as I was about to burst out laughing, my friend floated his head on the surface of the water and shouted in a loud voice.</p>
<p>"Hey, old friend, what are you doing there in a daze? Why don't you come down and soak too!"</p>
<p>"That's enough," I replied in a loud voice. "It's not bad here, is it?"</p>
<p>My friend's mouth had just uttered the words "interesting," when a wave rolled in, and he started moving his hands and feet again.</p>
<p>We didn't leave the beach until six o'clock. When we parted, I said to my friend:</p>
<p>"If your friend, a certain lady, decides to come to Shanghai again, why not ask her to take a trip to Gaoqiao?" (EL)</p>

<p>Ma Mingli, a native of Yuyao, 31 years old, worked at the Bank of China and had a history of mental illness. At 7:30 AM yesterday, he suffered a severe mental breakdown in his dormitory on the fourth floor of Zhongxing Villa, 155 Gsi Fleisher Road, West Shanghai. He suddenly lost his mind, and the thought of being tired of life arose. He jumped from the fourth-floor window, immediately injuring his head, abdomen, and arms severely. He was barely breathing. After someone reported it to the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau, the police rushed to the scene and took him to a hospital in West Shanghai for treatment. However, the treatment was ineffective, and he died shortly after.

<p>Wei Chonghua, a native of Xuzhou, 28 years old, worked as a porter in Peng Guiji's truck company at the Zhonghongqiao Pier. At around 8:00 AM yesterday, Wei and eight or nine other porters boarded Peng Guiji's truck, Concession Permit No. 16672, to go to Pudong to transport goods. As the truck passed the intersection of Pingliang Road and Qiwupu Road, it was speeding when suddenly a child appeared on the side of the road, seemingly wanting to cross the road. The driver, fearing an accident, braked suddenly. Unexpectedly, the force was too great, causing the porters standing on the truck to lose their balance and fall. Wei, who was standing on the edge, was thrown off the truck onto the ground. His head hit the brick and stone on the road, causing him to bleed profusely and lose consciousness. A nearby officer saw this and quickly helped him up and sent him to the hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of his brain injury, he died in the afternoon. The body was transferred to the autopsy center.</p>

<p>Zhang Baoqi, a native of Haimen who worked as a cook at Dexing's rice shop at No. 77, Lane 546, Tiantong Road, was carrying a rice pole at around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, delivering dinner to a customer in Honganli, Haining Road. Unexpectedly, Hua Linsheng, a native of Pudong who was pouring out cold rice, rushed up from behind, forcefully opened the rice pot, emptied it, and fled. Zhang, in a hurry, chased after him, grabbed him, and punched him hard in the lower abdomen out of extreme hatred. Hua was injured and fell to the ground, calling for help.

<p>Lin Hourong, a native of Ningbo, 47 years old, who lived on the upper floor of a hemp bag shop at No. 37, Jiuxingli Entrance, Xinkai River, Huangpu Beach Road, in the French Concession, used to be a senior clerk in a company, but recently became unemployed and worked as a day laborer at the wharf. His wife, Chen, 40 years old this year, had four sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Lin Fu, was 15 years old, the second son, Lin Guan, was 10 years old, the third son, Lin Di, was 5 years old, the youngest son, Wubao, was 3 years old, the eldest daughter, Lin Jie, was 12 years old, and the second daughter, Lin Mei, was 7 years old. At 8:30 AM yesterday, the youngest, Wubao, was in the room, and the other five children were playing on the four-story sun deck that was built on. Unexpectedly, Lin Di was young and was playing beside the sun deck. Accidentally, he lost his footing and fell from the high place to the cement ground in the lane, immediately losing consciousness. The Lin couple discovered this and reported it to the Xiaodongmen French Police Station, who immediately sent Chinese constable No. 527 to escort the injured child to Guangci Hospital. However, because the child's bones could not withstand the shock and his internal injuries were too severe, he died before reaching the hospital for treatment. The body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Morgue for examination. At noon that day, the Second Special Court was notified, and Chief Prosecutor Qiao Wanxuan and the forensic clerk arrived at the morgue to examine the body. It was determined that the dead child, Lin Di, died from injuries to his internal organs before death. After questioning the parents, the official ordered the body to be handed over to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Morgue for burial because the parents of the deceased could not afford to claim the body.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Zheng Shiyue, a Woman, Sues Gu Chengda for Seduction and Abandonment; Verdict Scheduled for the 16th After Trial <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Shiyue, a woman from Ningbo, is 20 years old and somewhat attractive. On the fourth day of the fourth lunar month of the 21st year of the Republic (1932), she married Gu Chengda, also from Ningbo. Later, due to financial difficulties, she became a saleswoman for the Great American Tobacco Company, earning 70-80 yuan per month, enough to make a living. At that time, due to her work, Zheng met Chen Mingxun, a 30-year-old man from Haiyan who owned the Rixin Chang foreign goods store at 29, 240 Lane, Edward Road, in September of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934). Chen was immediately attracted to Zheng’s graceful figure and charming appearance. He tried every means to seduce her, using his power and wealth to pressure her. Zheng,</p>
<p>tempted by the financial advantages, had a relationship with Chen at the Nanjing Hotel. Subsequently, Chen, fearing complications because Zheng was already married, incited her to break off her relationship with her husband. He claimed that he was unmarried and would marry Zheng if she divorced Gu Chengda. Zheng Shiyue, deceived by his words, believed him and discussed divorce with Gu Chengda. In the end, Gu Chengda was powerless to resist and had to reluctantly give in. On December 26th of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), both parties signed an agreement at lawyer Huang Xiuzhai's office, formally ending the marriage. Zheng gave Gu Chengda 360 yuan as</p>
<p>divorce compensation. Afterwards, Chen Mingxun immediately rented a house with Zheng at [omitted] Derun Lane, Luzon Road and began cohabitating. Soon after, they moved to No. 1, Lane 1370, Edward Road. At that time, Chen gave Zheng 300 yuan per month for living expenses, but he never mentioned marriage. Although Zheng urged him repeatedly, Chen Mingxun always evaded and made excuses. This spring, Chen suddenly changed his attitude, and it came to light that he had found new love and abandoned Zheng, even cutting off her living expenses. Zheng made several attempts to negotiate, but to no avail. She had no choice but to hire lawyer Wang Liangqing and file a</p>
<p>lawsuit of seduction and abandonment against Chen in the First Special Court's Criminal Division, requesting that Chen be punished according to Article 240, Section 2 and Article 239 of the Criminal Law, and to pay her living expenses of 300 yuan per month until she was 60 years old, totaling 144,000 yuan. The court approved the request and, on the 3rd of this month, entrusted Judge Huang Daxi to conduct the initial interrogation in the Fifth Criminal Court. Because the summons for Chen Mingxun could not be delivered at that time, only Zheng was interrogated, and the case was adjourned for a further hearing. Last Saturday was the date of the second hearing, Zheng</p>
<p>was absent due to illness. The defendant, Chen Mingxun, accompanied by his lawyer, arrived at the court on time. After a brief interrogation by the judge, Chen presented his defense in court, stating that the plaintiff, Zheng Shiyue, had worked as a prostitute in No. 82, Wufu Lane. In October of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), the defendant was invited by a friend to visit and later invited friends to play mahjong twice, and they became acquainted. He had no intention of marrying the plaintiff or taking her as a family member, and he did not know whether she was married or encourage her to divorce. After obtaining the statements, the judge questioned them again, then instructed the lawyers of both parties to begin their arguments and declared the conclusion. The verdict will be announced on the afternoon of the 16th of this month.</p>

<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, smuggled white sugar has been imported in a steady stream recently, flooding the city and the interior, sold at low prices, and business is booming. The country's sugar producers have suffered from this invasion, and their inventories are piling up, putting them in a precarious situation. According to reporters' inquiries from the sugar industry, although the price of smuggled sugar is slightly cheaper than domestically produced sugar, its quality is very poor. The white sugar contains a large amount of finely ground raw gypsum. On the surface, it looks very white and weighs more, so people generally think it is cheap and good. But in reality, the sweetness is greatly reduced, and raw gypsum is very easy to settle in the stomach. Over time, it can harden into stone in the stomach. Therefore, it is hoped that people will not be greedy for smuggled sugar and risk contracting an incurable disease for a small price.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Our National Football Team's European Tour - Written and Sent by Captain Li Huitang <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Penang-Rangoon Voyage (June 20-23)</p>
<p>After drawing with the Penang team on June 19th, we set sail for Rangoon the next day in a light drizzle. The distance between the two places is approximately 800 nautical miles, requiring 65 hours of travel. This British Indian Steam Navigation Company passenger ship can be considered quite slow. This stretch of sea was the most uncomfortable among the many voyages since leaving the country. For three days, it was mostly wind and rain, with occasional thunder and lightning. The deep black sea waves, with their snow-white spray, were quite a spectacle. However, many members of our team were seasick. On the first day, most managed to hold on, forcing themselves to go to the dining room to eat, but later, unable to withstand it, six or seven out of ten spent most of their time on the small, soft berths. The next day, the number of participants in the morning exercises was less than a handful. Among them, Liang Rongzhao, Zhuo Shijin, Zheng Jiliang, and Ye Beihua were the most susceptible. To make matters worse, Xu Yahui even fell ill with chills and fever on the ship, speaking incoherently at times. Our injured players have not yet recovered, and now with the added concern of illness, I am truly worried about how we will cope with the upcoming matches.</p>
<p>Rangoon Diary (June 23-30)</p>
<p>(June 23) The weak and feeble sun, shining through the cabin window, woke us up early. Stretching out, we saw that the ship had already entered the Rangoon inland river. After three days of confinement, we were all delighted to see land again. Those who feared the waves were even more elated, as if they had been granted a pardon. Rangoon is the capital of British Burma, with flourishing commerce and can be considered one of the important cities in the South Seas region. Chinese merchants have a long history here, mostly from Fujian and Guangdong. The residents are very superstitious, hence Rangoon is known for "three things in abundance": temples, crows, and monks. The weather here is also said to be quite peculiar. It is extremely hot in March, April, and May, and the wealthy all flock to the mountains to escape the heat. Then come the rainy seasons in June, July, and August, with rain every day. No wonder we were greeted with misty rain after breakfast, shrouding the scenery of the fields on both sides of the river. At 8:30 AM, dozens of representatives from welcoming overseas Chinese organizations and the consulate had already arrived on a small boat to meet us. After checking our passports, the ship docked at the wharf. On the shore, crowds of overseas Chinese were eagerly waiting, and the band was playing loudly, braving the drizzle to greet us as we disembarked. Rangoon was a place we had never set foot in before, so everyone was particularly excited. What was most dissatisfying was the particularly strict customs inspection here, and we were not given any special treatment. We spent a good half an hour in the customs checkpoint. Afterwards, we lined up to exit the wharf and meet the overseas Chinese community. The applause was thunderous. It was the first time the Chinese team had visited, and the enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese was far greater than in other places. It is not surprising that a welcoming committee had been pre-arranged here, raising a large sum of money. The committee was responsible for all aspects of our team's food, lodging, and transportation, demonstrating their enthusiasm. After disembarking, we boarded several cars, led by a marching band, and toured the main streets of Rangoon. Whenever we passed through busy urban areas, Chinese and Westerners alike cheered to greet us, causing traffic jams and shaking the entire city. It was somewhat like the grand welcome that Lindbergh received upon returning to America after flying across the Atlantic. Along the way, we passed several Fujian and Guangdong temples, and at the suggestion of the leaders of the overseas Chinese community, the entire team entered to pay respects, praying for blessings during our stay here. Although this was somewhat superstitious, we did not want to offend the sincere intentions of the overseas Chinese, so we lined up and bowed three times. It is said that all "new arrivals" from the motherland must visit the temple upon arrival to avoid disaster. The depth of superstition is both pitiable and laughable. We circled the entire city and then returned to our team's lodging. The lodging was a new-style Western house, specially reserved for our team to stay in. Upstairs, there were dozens of beds, neatly arranged in rows, almost creating the impression of sleeping together under a large blanket. After lunch, because today was the King's birthday, the city held special horse races, and our team was invited to watch. The racetrack was about five miles from the city, with magnificent buildings, beautiful flowers and trees, and attractive pavilions. The racetracks in Hong Kong and Shanghai were not even comparable. We came with enthusiasm and all contributed money to gamble a little. Each time the horses were about to reach the finish line, everyone cheered and shouted for their chosen horse, acting like children, attracting the attention of the entire racetrack. Li Guowei was the luckiest, winning over eighty yuan on a long shot, and everyone rushed to congratulate him, urging him to treat us. In the evening, as we had been confined to the ship for three days, we declined all invitations and rested at our lodging.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Hsien Fang Cup Tennis - Youxing and Lingnan Both Win Big - Morning Light's Failure to Muster a Team is a Pity <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The fifth Hsien Fang Cup Tennis League matches were held throughout the city yesterday. Many teams have already competed, but some matches have not been completed in the past two days and have been postponed. Mr. Lu Xiwu of the Chinese Tennis Federation, the organizer of the cup, hopes that all teams will promptly make up the matches to avoid prolonged delays. The results of yesterday's matches are listed below.</p>
<p>Lingnan Defeats Meilu 13-2</p>
<p>Lingnan faced Meilu again yesterday and achieved another great victory. Although Meilu only scored two points, Hu Qichang was able to win a point against the tough opponent Zhang Dingzhao, which is truly commendable. The overall battle was tense and worth watching.</p>
<p>(1) Zhang Dingzhao (Lingnan) defeats Hu Qichang (Meilu) 6-3, 6-2, 3-6</p>
<p>(2) Zhou Guanjun (Lingnan) defeats Hu Qijun (Meilu) 6-1, 6-2, 6-1</p>
<p>(3) Zhang Dingzhao and Zhou Guanjun (Lingnan) defeat Hu Qifeng and Hu Qibi (Meilu) 6-4, 6-3, 6-0</p>
<p>(4) Ma Anquan and Xu Demin (Lingnan) defeat Hu Qichang and Hu Qiming (Meilu) 3-6, 6-4, 6-0</p>
<p>(5) Zhao Junzhao and Wang Shuqing (Lingnan) defeat Hu Yunlai and Hu Qinian (Meilu) 6-3, 6-3, 6-3</p>
<p>Railway and Xia Village Tie 6-6</p>
<p>This match can be described as evenly matched. Except for the first singles match which was postponed, the rest of the matches were won by each team in two groups. The scores were also tied at six each. The important moment to determine the winner hinges on the postponed first singles match, which we will wait and see.</p>
<p>(2) Chen Hongduo (Xia) defeats Zhou Jianwen (Railway) 1-6, 6-0, 6-0</p>
<p>(2) Zhan Wenyao and Tang Wenwei (Railway) defeat Liu Jinbiao and Lu Meiseng (Xia) 6-1, 6-1, 8-6</p>
<p>(4) Zhou Jianwen and Chen Jiwen (Railway) defeat Liu Jianhua and Wang Guozhen (Xia) 3-6, 6-2, 6-2</p>
<p>(5) Chen Hongduo and Wu Yangwu (Xia) defeat Xue Xianyang and Chen Naixin (Railway) 6-1, 6-1, 6-1</p>
<p>Yukai Defeats Zhenru 14-1</p>
<p>This match was played at Jiangwan the day before yesterday. Although the Jinan athletes from Zhenru only scored one point in the third doubles match, their spirit is commendable and shines brightly in the cup competition.</p>
<p>(1) Gu Daqi (Yukai) defeats Yang Shufen (Zhenru) 6-0, 6-3, 6-2</p>
<p>(2) Liang Guanying (Yukai) defeats Situ Men (Zhenru) 6-1, 6-4, 6-3</p>
<p>(3) He Tongzhu and Long Yi (Yukai) defeat Chen Renbo and Situ Shan (Zhenru) 6-1, 6-1, 6-1</p>
<p>(4) Feng Xikang and Liang Guanying (Yukai) defeat Yun Feng and Zhong Yunzi (Zhenru) 6-2, 6-2, 6-2</p>
<p>(5) Huang Hongdao and Cai Bingheng (Yukai) defeat Liang Shufen and Liang Shukun (Zhenru) 6-3, 6-1, 2-6</p>
<p>Youxing Defeats Zhenru 15-0</p>
<p>Youxing also has a very strong strength. Zhenru is no match for them. As a result, Youxing won completely, creating a one-sided situation.</p>
<p>(1) Liu Jie (Youxing) defeats Yun Feng (Zhenru) 6-0, 6-2, 6-1</p>
<p>(2) He Yuqing (Youxing) defeats Liang Shufen (Zhenru) 6-1, 6-3, 6-2</p>
<p>(3) Liu Jie and Liu Keng (Youxing) defeat Situ Shan and Yang Shufen (Zhenru) 6-2, 6-3, 6-4</p>
<p>(4) Cao Tingzan and He Yuqing (Youxing) defeat Yun Feng and Zhong Yunzi (Zhenru) 6-0, 6-1, 6-1</p>
<p>(5) Jian Quanwen and Lin Deguang (Youxing) defeat Liang Shukun and Chen Renbo (Zhenru) 6-3, 6-0, 6-0</p>
<p>Dadecheng Defeats Chenguang 15-0 (Chenguang Forfeits)</p>
<p>Chenguang had few players yesterday and could not form a team. Although they played the second singles and first doubles matches, according to Article 8 of the Cup Competition Rules, "At least four groups must participate in the competition, otherwise it will be considered a forfeit." The team could not complete a full match, so it was treated as a forfeit. Furthermore, if a team forfeits twice, its competition qualification will be revoked. It is hoped that Chenguang will pay special attention.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Lu, regarding the match between Lingnan and Lingxing reported yesterday, Zhao Ziqian of Lingxing said that many of their team members were participating in the Huacheng Cup and requested that Lingnan postpone the match, but the request was not granted, so it should be considered a forfeit. The statement that the match was not officially played is not accurate. In addition, Chen Bainian of Xiachun said that in the second doubles match against Meilu, his name was mistakenly reported as Wu Yangwu.</p>

<h3 id="e180">On the Conde Floating Platform En Route from Hong Kong to Singapore <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Yi Qin</p>
<p>The ship was slow. Originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong at 2:00 PM on the 28th, it was delayed until 4:45 PM, stopping at the Kowloon commercial port on the opposite shore. The Hong Kong Chinese Amateur Athletic Federation had already dispatched a special small boat to welcome all the delegation members, ferrying them to the Hong Kong port. Those who came to welcome us included Mr. Xie Yuchuan, Mr. Yan Chengkun (who had returned from Singapore to Hong Kong a few days ago), and Mr. Lu Xiafu, among others, totaling over a dozen people. After the small boat arrived at the Star Ferry pier, we boarded specially prepared public buses to attend the welcoming reception hosted by the Chinese Amateur Athletic Federation. During the reception, Chairman Xie delivered a welcoming speech, followed by speeches of thanks from Mr. Shen Siliang and Superintendent Hao Gengsheng, who expressed their gratitude. After the meeting, the delegation members went to the commercial center to purchase miscellaneous items. When returning to the ship, everyone was carrying packages and Hong Kong newspapers. Delegation member Xiao was quite concerned about national affairs. We returned to the floating platform at 7:00 PM, and set sail directly for Singapore around 8:00 PM.</p>
<p>Those who boarded the ship in Hong Kong included the nine members of the observation delegation: Xu Minhui, Liu Beida, Ye Guantao, Tan Bin, Guo Songtang, and athletes Huang Jiliang (football), Yang Xiuqiong, Chen Zhenxing (swimming), and Huang Yingjie (track and field). After leaving Hong Kong, various organizations within the delegation were gradually established. The Administrative Committee was composed of Shen Siliang, Hao Gengsheng, Yuan Dunli, John Ma, Lao Te, Gao Zi, Zhou Jiaqi, and Shi Qikang. There was also a Lecture Committee composed of Yuan Dunli, Gao Zi, and Wu Cheng. The first lecture was given by Hao Gengsheng on the morning of the 29th, titled "The Current Situation of Chinese Education." In addition to the delegation members, many passengers also attended. Other activities were also very active. The Training Committee stipulated that starting from June 30th, morning exercises would be held on the deck every day from 7:00 AM to 7:30 AM (except Sundays), and all delegation members were required to attend, led in rotation by the following individuals:</p>
<p>(June 30th) John Ma (July 1st) Huang Liming (2nd) Hao Ming (3rd) Wu Cheng (4th) Wang Huaiqi (6th) Dong Shouyi (7th) Song Junfu (8th) Ye Liang (9th) Gao Zi (10th) Hou Luoxun (11th) Shao Rugan (13th) Qian Yiqin (14th) Li Zhou (15th) Wang Shoufang (16th) Li Youzhen (17th) Wu Bangwei (18th) Park Longyuan. There was also a German conversation class, with 28 delegation members participating, divided into four groups (A, B, C, D), taught by Courtful, Wu Cheng, and Huang Yuankai. The Entertainment Committee held a Chinese chess championship from July 1st to 4th, with 18 delegation members participating. Among them, Wu Demao, Lin Shaozhou, Feng Youzhen, and Qian Yiqin were considered the most likely to win. The first entertainment gathering was scheduled to be held at 9:00 PM on the evening of July 2nd, and the program mostly consisted of national martial arts performances, Peking opera, and Cantonese opera, promising a lively atmosphere. On the evening of July 1st, all delegation members practiced singing together, and will continue to practice in preparation for use in the Olympic Games. In addition to reading, writing letters, and playing chess, many of the athletes were also practicing sports and swimming. There were two small pools on the ship, less than 20 feet long and no more than 10 feet wide, so there was quite a crowd. The ship also had movie facilities, which were viewed by different classes of passengers. Since the start of the voyage, two movies have been shown, and many delegation members watched them. Around 10:00 AM on the morning of July 2nd, we arrived in Singapore. No fewer than two hundred people came to welcome us at the pier, each holding a national flag and shouting the slogan "Victory to the Chinese Delegation!" After disembarking, we departed from Tanjong Pagar Wharf and toured the city by public bus. After the tour, we went to the grand welcoming reception jointly organized by the overseas Chinese organizations at the Great World amusement park. The delegation also held a basketball exhibition game at 4:00 PM in the afternoon, and were scheduled to return to the ship at 5:30 PM on the same day to set sail for Colombo.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Hua Cheng Cup Tennis Second Week - Carson Easily Defeats Chen Yi Yesterday <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The first Kangdi Open Tennis Hua Cheng Cup singles tournament, yesterday was the second week, with sixteen groups competing. The games started at 9:00 AM and finished around 6:00 PM, held in three sessions. The most intense matches yesterday were Zhao Junzhao vs. Dong Junpei, Li Guofan vs. Ye Baosheng, Shi Guia vs. Feng Yipei, and Shen Meizhen vs. Zhou Guanjun. However, Carson's victory over Chen Yi was particularly hard-won. In the first set, Chen won two games in a row, but Carson gradually caught up. Then Chen again surpassed Carson with a score of 3-2, but Carson won three consecutive games, taking the lead at 5-3. Chen did not lose heart and managed to tie the score. At this point, Carson's baseline shots were ineffective, so he quickly moved to the net for volleys and finally won the first set 7-5. In the second set, after Chen won the first game, Carson took five games in a row. Although Chen fought hard, he was unable to reverse the situation and lost to Carson 6-2. Carson is the most promising candidate for this year's championship, and Chen Yi was indeed no match for him. Kerasha's victory over Xu Demin was entirely due to Xu's poor serving. The competition between Shi Guia and Feng Yipei was fierce. In the final match, Shen Meizhen vs. Zhou Guanjun, Zhou led 6-2 in the first set. It was drizzling, but the two continued to play. Shen pulled back with 6-3 in the second set. The last set was crucial. Shen became excited and played barefoot, but her strength was insufficient and she lost again with 6-1. The results of yesterday's games and the schedule for next week are recorded below.</p>

<p>The National Government has also allocated 5 million yuan for the fourth item, education construction funds, within the seventh item, education and culture expenses, of the temporary expenditure section of the budget for the 25th year of the Republic of China. It is stated that this 5 million yuan is for expenses such as compulsory education, mass education, film broadcasting education, etc. It is reported that the central education authorities have recently held meetings and finalized the allocation of compulsory education funds to various provinces and cities. The Ministry of Education will soon issue telegrams to inform the provinces and cities. The allocation method for mass education, film broadcasting education, and other expenses will be decided in meetings to be held within days. It is noted that in the 24th year, the central government subsidized 2.4 million yuan for compulsory education expenses to various provinces and cities, plus tens of thousands of yuan from the Sino-British and other Gengkuan institutions, totaling 3.2 million yuan. In the current 25th year, all provinces and cities are making great efforts to promote compulsory education, and the actual need for funds is very large. On one hand, provinces, cities, and localities are raising funds themselves, and on the other hand, they are still requesting special subsidies from the central government. The central government has also taken this into consideration, so in the 25th year, 5 million yuan has been allocated for education construction expenses. In addition to paying about one million yuan for mass education, film broadcasting education, and other expenses, the compulsory education item, including Gengkuan subsidies, will total approximately 4.4 million yuan, an increase of about 1.2 million yuan compared to the 24th year.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Reading the National General Budget for the 25th Year <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Youfei</p>
<p>The general outline of the budget for the 25th year was compiled by the Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounts and Statistics in mid-May and passed by the Central Political Council in mid-June. Subsequently, the Executive Yuan, based on the general outline, compiled the general budget, which was passed by the Legislative Yuan on June 30th and officially promulgated. This time, the budget figure was reduced by approximately 20 million yuan compared to the draft general outline prepared by the Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounts and Statistics. According to the official document submitted by the Executive Yuan to the Legislative Yuan, the originally planned revenue and expenditure exceeded 1 billion yuan. While the revenue and expenditure appeared balanced on the surface, the revenue portion, as proposed by the Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounts and Statistics, included an additional 180 million yuan in debt income, 10 million yuan in net profit from state-owned businesses, and 12 million yuan in consolidated taxes, resulting in an actual difference of over 20 million yuan. In order to achieve a balanced revenue and expenditure and consolidate the credit of the legal tender, the review was based on the following three principles: (1) Regular expenses should not exceed the approved budget amount from the previous year; (2) Newly established agencies should be postponed if not necessary; (3) Temporary expenses should not be included if not necessary. These three principles were used to reduce expenditures, resulting in a total amount of 990,658,450 yuan.</p>
<p>According to the budget for the 25th year published by the Legislative Yuan this time, the total amount is slightly inflated compared to the 24th year, with an increase of 30 million yuan. The detailed items of various revenues and expenditures have both increases and decreases. The items with larger increases and decreases are as follows: (Unit: 1,000 yuan)</p>
<p>Under Revenue Items</p>
<p>Consolidated Tax Increase 18,254</p>
<p>Debt Increase 55,000</p>
<p>Customs Duties Decrease 23,424</p>
<p>Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Decrease 4,781</p>
<p>State-Owned Revenue Decrease 3,067</p>
<p>Other Decrease 13,588</p>
<p>Under Expenditure Items</p>
<p>State Affairs Expenses Increase 2,410</p>
<p>Internal Affairs Expenses Increase 4,232</p>
<p>Education and Culture Expenses Increase 6,836</p>
<p>Construction Expenses Increase 16,719</p>
<p>State-Owned Business Capital Increase 53,367</p>
<p>Party Affairs Expenses Decrease 2,452</p>
<p>Financial Affairs Expenses Decrease 5,911</p>
<p>Debt Expenses Decrease 35,765</p>
<p>Among the above-listed increases and decreases, this year's budget is an improvement over previous years. This is because government affairs expenses are generally slightly reduced compared to last year. Even party affairs expenses, which have been expanding year by year since the 21st year of the Republic, have been reduced this year. At the same time, education and culture expenses and construction expenses have all increased slightly. From the perspective of the general public, the reduction in consumptive expenditures in the allocation of expenditures is beneficial.</p>
<p>However, upon careful analysis of the various figures, this year's budget still cannot escape the established patterns of previous years' budgets. In terms of revenue, customs duties still occupy the first place in terms of figures. Furthermore, the total amount of the six indirect tax items, including salt tax, tobacco and alcohol tax, stamp tax, consolidated tax, and mining tax, reaches more than 650 million yuan, accounting for 67% of the total revenue. The next most important source of revenue is debt income, accounting for about 13% of the total. The next most important source of revenue is the three direct tax items, namely the exchange tax, transaction tax, income tax, and bank tax, accounting for 8% of the total revenue. The remaining 2% is other income. Therefore, indirect taxes and debt income still occupy an important position of 80% in the total revenue, while direct taxes are only secondary.</p>
<p>In terms of expenditure, military expenses still rank first, debt expenses still rank second, and the ratio between the total amount of various consumptive expenditures and non-consumptive expenditures is still very large. Therefore, whether viewed from the perspective of revenue or expenditure, this year's national general budget has made progress in terms of principles. However, strictly speaking in terms of actual revenue and expenditure, the improvements are still very few.</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan reduced the total revenue and expenditure figures of the general outline by 20 million yuan, mostly due to the reduction in actual revenue. In order to strive for a balanced revenue and expenditure in reality, the figures for revenue were reduced on the one hand, and the figures for expenditure were reduced on the other hand, which shows the seriousness of the published budget this time. The Executive Yuan has already considered the expenditure aspect, and further reductions are of course impossible. Therefore, let us discuss the revenue figures here.</p>
<p>A tax system centered on indirect taxes is not only highly flexible but also absolutely harmful to the national economy, and the distribution is unfair, which is not in line with general tax principles. This has already been a consensus among the government and the public. However, this year's budget still cannot break away from the indirect tax-centered system. Of course, fiscal reform may not be consistent in theory and practice and cannot be achieved overnight. What is worrisome is that there may already be problems with the various indirect tax items in this year's budget as listed in the budget. Under the customs duty item, due to the decline in national purchasing power and the decline in import and export trade in recent years, it has been gradually decreasing. The increasingly serious problem of smuggling in North China in the past six months has also created a huge obstacle to customs revenue. The Executive Yuan also considered this point in its official document to the Legislative Yuan, but only added a caveat of strictly cracking down on smuggling. Although the customs duty figure in this budget has been reduced by more than 20 million yuan, according to the customs statistics last year, customs revenue has already decreased by 20 million yuan compared to previous years. In the first quarter of this year, the customs revenue in North China mostly decreased by more than 28%. Therefore, even if smuggling is strictly cracked down on as soon as possible, I am afraid that the amount of the decrease will definitely be more than 20 million yuan.</p>
<p>Here, let's first mention the consolidated tax, which ranks third among the indirect taxes. According to the national budget in recent years, the position of the consolidated tax in revenue has been gradually increasing. In fact, the actual amount collected each year is also more than the budget. In recent years, the decrease in customs revenue has been compensated for by the consolidated tax, which is not a bad method. However, the increased burden of the consolidated tax on the national production industry is certainly debatable, and in recent years, the national industries that can be called national industries are almost all struggling in hardship. Therefore, while methods can certainly be used to increase the income of the consolidated tax, in fact, it is feared that the consolidated tax will also decrease due to the dimness of various industries. What is even more worrisome is that in today's world of rampant smuggled goods, the resistance of national industries in the market is gradually weakening, and the income of the consolidated tax will definitely feel reduced. From the perspective of the budget itself, whether the actual amount collected of the consolidated tax at the end of this year will exceed the budget as in previous years is another debatable point.</p>
<p>The second largest indirect tax is the salt tax. The increase in the salt tax affects the common people, and its harm is greater than that of the consolidated tax. The actual amount of salt tax collected each year has also been increasing year by year, according to recent budgets. However, the reason for the increase is not natural but artificial. In many salt-producing areas, there is a trend of increasing production, creating a situation of hoarding salt, which is close to prepaid. At the same time, some salt-producing areas have gradually become integrated with the problem of smuggling and tax evasion, which will also be a national problem in terms of actual collection in the future.</p>
<p>The three items under direct taxes, such as the exchange tax, have been included in the budget for more than a year. According to the recent announcement by the government of the draft treaty on inheritance tax and income tax, it may be possible to see the realization of the attempt to replace indirect taxes with direct taxes in the future. However, according to the figures in this year's budget, the figures for these direct taxes have not been expanded compared to previous years, which shows that the implementation period must still be awaited.</p>
<p>According to general fiscal principles, recurring revenue should be listed as recurring expenditure, and temporary revenue should be listed as temporary expenditure. Therefore, all debt income should be treated as temporary revenue. Although debt income is included in the temporary sector in this national general budget, there is already a slight imbalance between the total amount of recurring revenue and expenditure. If the budgets of previous years are examined, a principle can be obtained: that is, no matter what position tax revenue occupies in the total revenue of each year's budget, if the percentage of tax revenue and the percentage of debt income are added together, the number is the same. In other words, if tax revenue increases in a certain year, debt income decreases; if tax revenue decreases, borrowing increases. Therefore, using debt income to cover budget deficits has become a common occurrence. On the surface, debt income is in the temporary revenue sector, but in reality, it has long been allocated for recurring purposes. If indirect taxes are reduced this year and direct taxes have not yet started, according to past practice, this difference can be added to the debt. However, since the issuance of the National Unification and Reconstruction Bonds in February, this huge figure has been unprecedented. In terms of the limit of market purchases, the possibility of re-issuing new bonds is extremely small. Even the Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounts and Statistics of the National Government believes that regarding future borrowing: "The government is currently using the method of consolidating public debt to complete the legal tender policy and balance national treasury revenue and expenditure, which is a suitable policy for dealing with times of national crisis. However, the current subscribers to this public debt are mainly banks, and the power to purchase public debt is limited to the amount of new deposits added by banks. If public debt is issued beyond this limit, it will inevitably lead to inflation." Since our country's financial organization is not completely consolidated and the public lacks knowledge of currency, inflation will naturally be harmful to the national economy.</p>
<p>If attention is paid to the expenditure of debt expenses at the same time as the debt income item, there is another point worth noting. That is, the expenditure of debt expenses is almost equal to half of the debt income. Therefore, using the method of borrowing to make up for the budget deficit, even if there is no problem with the issuance, the increase in debt expenses is tantamount to preparing for the increase in the deficit in the second year, which is a prepaid nature. According to the current reduced debt expenses, it already occupies a very important position in finance, let alone increasing it further? Therefore, using debt income to cover the deficit is definitely not a solution.</p>
<p>The Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounts and Statistics of the National Government put forward six suggestions for making up for the budget balance, namely: (1) The operating surplus of the Central Bank is not yet included in the budget; (2) The unified public debt is from the salt of Lu, and about 180 million yuan of face value can be left; (3) The increase in the consolidated tax; (4) The levying of direct taxes; (5) There are domestic and foreign debt reserves in the debt expenses that can be transferred; (6) The debt expenses have a slight surplus. Some of the above six suggestions can only be regarded as special circumstances, because they are definitely not something that can be had every year. Even if this year's budget can be made up for by using the above six methods, the balance of revenue and expenditure in the future is still a problem.</p>
<p>According to one of the principles of the Executive Yuan's budget reduction, temporary expenses should not be included if they are not necessary, which shows that there is still a great range of flexibility left in the expenditure aspect.</p>
<p>In short, after reading this year's general budget, it is very clear that considerable efforts are still needed to achieve a balanced revenue and expenditure. The main reason why it is difficult to balance revenue and expenditure is that there can be no thorough improvement in revenue and expenditure. Therefore, in addition to throttling spending, the maintenance of indirect tax revenue requires strict anti-smuggling methods to prevent the intrusion of smuggling, while moving direct taxes from paper to implementation is even more urgent. This is still peacetime finance. If it comes to a non-ordinary period, the question of budget balance and the threat of deficits will of course be greater than it is now, which is even more necessary to prepare for in advance.

<p>The changes in the outstanding amount of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank Credit can be observed through its weekly periodic reports, which indicate the factors that increase or decrease the outstanding amount of the Federal Reserve Bank. The numbers listed in the report for the week of January 9, 1935, are reprinted as follows:</p>

<p>(Note) Does not include $10,000,000 in entrusted funds</p>
<p>The above report is now explained item by item to understand the importance of Federal Reserve credit:</p>
<p>(1) Discounted Notes: This item represents loans from member banks to the Reserve Bank, which are used to supplement reserve balances. There are various factors for the increase in loans, such as (A) an increase in member bank deposits; (B) the Reserve Bank selling securities or accepting notes; (C) gold exports or designated uses; (D) an increase in currency in circulation; and (E) an increase in non-member bank deposits in the Reserve Bank. Other items in the report are also helpful in explaining the reasons for the increase or decrease in member bank borrowing from the Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>(2) Purchased Notes and U.S. Government Securities: These two items reflect the Reserve Bank's operations in the public market. An increase in holdings of accepted notes or government securities places federal funds at the disposal of member banks; conversely, a decrease reduces the amount of Federal Reserve credit. Changes in these two items can indicate the public market policy adopted by the Reserve System. An increase in public market purchases indicates the Reserve Bank's aim to stabilize the financial market.</p>
<p>(3) Industrial Advances: This item includes loans to private enterprises made in accordance with the regulations of June 19, 1934. In terms of the relationship with the financial market, this type of lending is no different from discounted notes.</p>
<p>(4) Other Reserve Bank Credit: This item represents several detailed items, such as so-called "Float," which occurs in the Reserve Bank System as an agent for commercial banks to collect checks and drafts. "Float" is different from "Uncollected Items" and "Deferred Availability Items." In other words, it is the credit given by the Reserve Bank to commercial banks that the commercial banks have not yet received. This item also includes bonds of the Federal Intermediate Credit Bank, bonds of the Federal Land Bank, municipal bonds, and debts owed by foreign central banks held by the Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>(5) Total Reserve Bank Credit: This is the sum of the above five items and is the total outstanding amount of Federal Reserve Bank credit.</p>
<p>(6) Gold Coin and Currency in Stock: This item represents the total amount of gold held by the Treasury. An increase in gold, whether due to imports, exemption from designated uses, or new production, is sufficient to increase member bank reserve balances. This is because gold must be sold to the Treasury or the Reserve Bank, and the check paid for it is deposited into the member bank's account at the Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>(7) Treasury and National Bank Currency: This item represents the currency issued by the Treasury to supplement the financial system and directly bears its responsibility. An increase in this item is a symbol of the Treasury's issuance of large amounts of currency, which results in an increase in the balance of member banks' deposits at the Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>(8) Currency in Circulation: This item represents the total amount of various actual circulating currencies. A decrease in the amount of currency in circulation reduces the amount of member bank reserve balances because currency is obtained by member banks from the Reserve Bank, and their repayment of banknotes is taken from their reserve balances. Conversely, a decrease in the amount of currency results in an increase in member bank balances because member banks return unneeded currency to the Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>(9) Treasury Cash and Deposits in Federal Reserve Banks: This item represents the funds available to the Treasury, which is different from the funds deposited by the Treasury in commercial banks from the sale of government securities. It includes gold, exchange stabilization funds, general funds, and currency held by the Treasury, as well as government deposits in the Reserve Bank. A decrease in this item is sufficient to indicate that the Treasury has transferred cash or Reserve Bank deposits to the banking sector, resulting in an increase in member bank reserve balances. An increase in this item can indicate that cash has been paid into the Treasury, or that the Treasury has transferred deposits from commercial banks to the Reserve Bank, and the reserve balances of member banks decrease accordingly.</p>
<p>(10) Non-Member Bank Deposits and Other Federal Reserve Items: This item includes a number of detailed items, with non-member bank deposits being the most important. Non-member banks maintain deposits in the Reserve Bank for clearing purposes. A decrease in this balance results in an increase in member bank reserve balances because the funds lost by non-member banks are transferred to member banks.</p>
<p>Based on the above simple explanation, it can be determined what factors should be responsible for the $193.3 million decrease in member bank reserve balances in the weekly report of January 9, 1935.</p>
<p>Factors Increasing Member Bank Reserve Balances</p>
<p>1.  Increase in Industrial Advances 1,000,000</p>
<p>2.  Increase in Other Reserve Bank Credit 6,000,000</p>
<p>3.  Increase in Gold Coin and Currency in Stock 15,000,000</p>
<p>4.  Decrease in Currency in Circulation 114,000,000</p>
<p>5.  Decrease in Treasury Cash and Deposits in Federal Reserve Banks 70,000,000</p>
<p>Total Increase 206,000,000</p>
<p>Factors Decreasing Member Bank Reserve Balances</p>
<p>1.  Decrease in U.S. Treasury Securities 1,000,000</p>
<p>2.  Decrease in Treasury and National Bank Currency 6,000,000</p>
<p>3.  Increase in Non-Member Bank Deposits and Other Federal Reserve Items 6,000,000</p>
<p>Total Decrease 13,000,000</p>
<p>Total Increase in Member Bank Reserve Balances 193,000,000</p>
<p>In recent years, the development of finance and the promulgation of new banking and monetary laws during the Roosevelt administration have brought about tremendous changes in the power of the Federal Reserve System to manage credit. Under the control of the new laws, the old tools for managing credit no longer exist. The Reserve Bank no longer uses the discount rate and public market operations as the basis for manipulating bank credit. Instead, there are new forces at play.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the commercial depression in 1929, member banks began to increase their reserve balances above the legal limit. This effect was partly due to the contraction of bank credit, partly due to the inflow of gold, and partly due to the Reserve Bank's adoption of a sound monetary policy. In 1932, the Reserve Bank began to jointly purchase large amounts of government securities. Within a few months, its holdings increased by $1.1 billion. The aim of this policy was to increase the excess reserves of member banks in order to curb the contraction of credit and encourage its expansion. Although the result was not effective, this policy was implemented again in 1933. At this time, the Reserve Bank further increased its holdings of government securities by more than $600 million. The only effect of this was to increase the reserve balances of member banks to an unprecedented proportion. In September 1934, excess reserves reached as much as $2 billion.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the discount rate of the Reserve Bank became insignificant. Member banks reduced their borrowing from the Reserve Bank to a negligible amount, so that in theory, although their loans and deposits expanded by $20 billion, the credit of the Reserve Bank did not expand accordingly. The Reserve Bank holds approximately $2.43 billion in government securities, which could be sold in the public market to eliminate the excess reserves of member banks. However, this plan would have a huge impact on the government securities market by lowering market prices. Given the Treasury's heavy responsibility to assist the government in implementing its recovery plan, it is self-evident that it would not adopt such a plan.</p>
<p>In fact, the power to manage member bank reserve balances today has largely shifted to the Treasury. This development is mostly due to the devaluation of the U.S. dollar and the revaluation of domestic gold coin and currency, which gave the Treasury a profit of $2.8 billion. Of this, $2 billion was allocated to the stabilization fund, and the remainder was added to the general fund for gold. However, in terms of credit, the distinction is irrelevant. The important point is that the Treasury's consumption of gold, other than exporting gold, will have the same increase in member bank reserve balances.</p>
<p>The Treasury can use a portion of the gold to meet the country's liquid expenditures. The method is to deposit gold certificates in the Reserve Bank. This action increases the Treasury's deposits at the Reserve Bank, which is used to issue checks to repay debts. The checks issued are deposited in commercial banks, and finally returned to the Reserve Bank for payment. The Reserve Bank then often credits the member bank's account, so the increase in member bank reserve balances is the same as the inflow of gold. On September 19, 1934, the Treasury had more than $3 billion in free gold and deposits in the Reserve Bank. If this amount were spent in its entirety, excess reserves would increase from the current level of $2 billion to $5 billion. Although this development is far from reality, the position of member bank reserves is not so much controlled by the Federal Reserve Bank as it is completely controlled by the Treasury. In fact, because of the stability of the U.S. dollar, the Reserve Bank has only become a tool for the Treasury to increase member bank reserve balances.</p>
<p>A Congressional law stipulates that the total amount of silver purchased at home and abroad should be 25% of the gold currency in stock. This is another reason why the Treasury can increase member bank reserve balances. Since the silver is obtained by the Treasury, the Treasury has the right to issue silver certificates, and the amount of currency is increased accordingly. The increase in currency is not actually necessary, so it returns to the banks, and the banks deposit it in the Reserve Bank, increasing the balance of member banks' deposits in the Reserve Bank. With this effect, the Treasury can interfere with the ordinary actions of the Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>The Treasury's influence on the financial market is so great. However, the Reserve Bank is not unable to manage the expansion of member bank credit. First, according to the Banking Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act, the Reserve Bank has broad powers to regulate mortgage lending, which can curb the expansion of securities lending and prevent speculative frenzies, such as the story of 1928 to 1929. Second, and more importantly, the Agricultural Adjustment Act of May 12, 1933, authorized the Federal Reserve Board, with the approval of the President, to declare an emergency period due to credit expansion. During this period, it can arbitrarily increase or decrease the reserve balances for legally required demand or time deposits at any time. This power is a way for the Federal Reserve Board to eliminate the excess reserves of member banks and restore its ability to manage the current financial market.</p>
<p>However, what should also be studied is that the actions of the Federal Reserve Board in the past to curb credit expansion have often been opposed by the political and business communities. This was the case in both 1920 and 1929. Now, under the guidance of the Treasury, its power has greatly increased compared to before. The Federal Reserve Board has great power to curb credit expansion; its exercise must have the approval and assistance of the government, so the future of the Reserve Bank's management of credit has become a political issue.</p>
<p>In addition to influencing Federal Reserve policy and using free gold and issuing silver certificates to affect member bank reserve balances, the Treasury can also use ordinary financial resources to influence the financial market under normal circumstances. On the 15th of March, June, September, and December of each year, the Treasury engages in collecting taxes, recovering funds, and using bank funds to pay interest on government debt, selling Treasury bills, debt certificates, long-term bonds, and repaying matured issues. Although the amount of transactions is huge, the Treasury's advanced investment techniques ensure that the financial market does not experience any disturbances, and interest rates are not subject to temporary fluctuations.</p>
<p>The details and amounts of this technical defense investment vary from time to time, and the factors that govern it are various, such as the Treasury's cash balance, the government's financial needs for the next quarter, the budgeted amount of tax collection, the situation in the government securities market, and the amount of debt repayment due. The Treasury's seasonal financial operations begin on the 15th, releasing funds to pay interest on public debt, repay short-term Treasury bills, and for special purposes—such as the old-age military officer loans on March 15, 1931—payment is made with checks from the Reserve Bank, and the recipients deposit them in commercial banks, which in turn deposit them in the Reserve Bank. The result is an increase in member bank reserve balances. At the same time, the Treasury receives checks from commercial banks, which are used to pay taxes and the Treasury's new debts. The collection of these checks is debited to member banks' deposits at the Reserve Bank, resulting in the opposite of payment.</p>
<p>If the payments and receipts match, member bank reserve balances will not change. However, in practice, receipts often lag payments by several days, and the Treasury relies on borrowing from the Reserve Bank as the only way to settle its debts during this period. The borrowing method is to adopt debt certificates with a special date, the amount of which can be as high as hundreds of millions of dollars, which are rolled over daily and reduced according to the amount of income.</p>
<p>This borrowing is credited to the Treasury's account at the Reserve Bank for the Treasury's use, which results in the expansion of Federal Reserve Bank credit and increases member bank deposits. Under normal circumstances, this can provide temporary artificial stability to the market. There are several ways to prevent this situation from occurring: First, the Reserve Bank sells the special Treasury debt certificates it participates in to member banks (mostly in New York), and spends the funds under the reserve balance. Second, the Reserve Bank sells government securities in the public market or reduces its holdings of accepted bills, and all maturing bills are not replenished, so that the impact of the Treasury's borrowing can be offset. However, this method is not easy to implement. For example, in 1934, the Reserve Bank's sale of a small amount of savings had an adverse impact on the market price of government securities, which would contradict the government's fiscal policy. At the same time, the holdings of accepted bills are extremely small, and the non-replenishment of maturing bills is not enough to affect the reserve balances of member banks. Finally (the third method), the New York Reserve Bank is allowed to temporarily fall below the legal limit, so that the lack before the Treasury's operation is corrected by excess reserves a few days later.</p>
<p>Although most of the Treasury's operations are concentrated in the tax collection season and the interest payment period, its constant dealings with the banking sector have a greater impact on the credit situation than seasonal investment. According to convention, the Treasury keeps a large amount of cash and deposits it in domestic commercial banks, and the checks it issues are drawn on its deposits at the Reserve Bank. Only when necessary will the deposits in commercial banks be transferred to the Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Treasury's routine operations cause funds to move between the Reserve Bank and commercial banks in two ways: On the one hand, the Treasury draws checks on its deposits at the Reserve Bank, which are deposited in member banks, and finally credited to the Reserve Bank's account again; on the other hand, the Treasury withdraws deposits from commercial banks and deposits them in the Reserve Bank, which results in expenditures from the Reserve Bank's member account. Therefore, unless the amounts of receipts and payments are the same, the reserve balances of member banks will be affected. For example, at the end of the week of September 26, 1934, member bank reserves increased by $81 million, mostly due to the $63 million decrease in the Treasury's cash and deposits in the Federal Reserve Bank.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Securities: Big Players Continuously Buying, Government Bonds Steadily Rose Last Week <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Increased by $1.89 to $2.65. Afternoon Trading Temporarily Suspended for Three Weeks Starting Today.</p>
<p>Last week, from July 6th to 11th, the market situation on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange gradually rose and was quite tight. It was the first good market since the Guangdong-Guangxi Incident. It was more than $3 higher than the lowest price. Compared to the highest price, with Type A bonds, it was only more than $1 lower. The situation in Guangdong and Guangxi became increasingly chaotic due to internal strife. General short-covering and large players going long at the same time caused the market to rebound and rise sharply. However, there are still problems with the Guangdong affair, and the North China Incident is becoming more and more difficult. Although various parties are single-mindedly moving forward, future changes will still involve fierce ups and downs. Reviewing last week, on Monday, there were rumors in the market about Fujian, down by 5.7 cents, and the trend was for three consecutive small declines. The market rebounded at the close. On Tuesday, the situation was depressing, brewing for change. On the 4th, buying resumed, and the market immediately rebounded by half a dollar. On Wednesday, retail investors covered shorts, and large players also bought in, causing a strong rebound and a sharp rise of about $1. On Thursday, the appetite of large players became stronger, and retail investors covered even more enthusiastically, causing a large rise of 78 cents to $1.45. The market price in August repeatedly reached new highs. On Friday, some bulls exited, causing a slight decline of 23 cents, but the trend remained firm. On Saturday, large players continued to buy in, and there were also certain rumors in the market, causing the market price to rebound again, rising by several cents to more than $1. The high market prices in recent days, although due to changes in the situation and short-covering, were also due to a large number of speculators going long. Therefore, if the long side wavers slightly, the short side will surge, and there will be many more waves in the future. As a result of the week's market prices, all rose by $1.89 to $2.65. The total transaction volume was $52.6 million. In addition, the exchange announced that due to the hot weather, afternoon trading will be temporarily suspended for one week starting today, and will resume as usual on August 1st. The results of the increases and decreases are compared in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit is 100 yuan):</p>

<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened with prices falling by 6 points and rising by 2 points for various months. The market was active in the morning, but the news from Liverpool was not good. Liverpool and mainland dealers sold, and cotton farmers hedged, and bulls took profits, causing prices to rebound. Afterwards, industry peers, Wall Street, and the Far East bought in, and shorts covered when prices fell, resulting in a slight rebound. Currently, the focus is on the need for rain in the early-growing areas. Borrowed cotton has been sold off in the South. Textiles have been in short supply during the week. The closing price was stable. Spot prices fell by 6 points, and futures fell by 6 to 11 points. English cotton spot prices rose by 8 points, and futures fell by 12 points. Indian cotton initially fell due to large-scale bull profit-taking, but later strengthened due to buying by Japanese merchants, European exporters, and futures traders. Bengal rose by 1.25 to 3.25 rupees, Oomra rose by 1.5 to 3.5 rupees, and Broach rose by 0.75 to 2.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 11th):</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Egg Factory Syndicate procured eight to nine hundred boxes of English tinplate, with the market price opening at $18.90 per box, an increase of about forty cents compared to before. However, overseas prices have been soaring in recent days, so market quotations are already asking for $19.</p>
<p>In addition, syndicates in Changsha, Hankou, and Shantou are also telegraphing to order, as there is hope for peace in the military affairs of Guangdong and Guangxi. The situation from now on is expected to be very optimistic.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, various syndicates sourced seventeen to eighteen labels, totaling three thousand six to seven hundred piculs. Retail sales remained sluggish. The Baozi Qingdao Syndicate also only procured over five hundred packages, so the market situation was extremely weak and it seemed difficult to recover quickly. Prices for thick early japonica and thin rice both fell by a few cents to nearly ten cents. Due to the influence of customer-grade rice, Duyang top-grade rice suddenly plummeted by ten to twenty cents. Sales of Yinbian Yuan rice were both rare.</p>

<p>— (Liu Fangdi)</p>
<p>Fire tests gold; adversity tests heroes.</p>
<p>Everything that creates virtue is cruel.</p>
<p>The greatest pain is nothing more than being blamed by one's own conscience.</p>
<p>Young people should cherish their careers as much as they cherish their youth.</p>
<p>Women's faces and warriors' guns equally create a history of humanity.</p>
<p>Integrity is a moral sentiment; piety is a religious sentiment.</p>
<p>Do not accept even a small favor from a mean person, for it will become your lifelong burden.</p>
<p>History is always sacrificing human lives; the new light of history must come from hell.</p>
<p>Although love is as intoxicating as a rose, it is also as thorny as a rose.</p>
<p>Major events always happen by chance. But in a moment of chance, our fate is decided.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Page of Morality <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Lanshan</p>
<p>Everyone sighs and says, "Shanghai is a place with poor morals." This is indeed true, but perhaps this is because there are too many people who like to read news about the corruption of morals, so so many events that corrupt morals are happening, right?</p>
<p>When the court hears those scandalous cases—whether it is rape, seduction, or consensual adultery—out of concern for morality, eager onlookers always flock to the court. Young people are particularly curious. When reading the newspaper every day, they first grab the local news section and concentrate on finding records of topics that stimulate their inspiration, chewing them over carefully, the longer the better, with relish.</p>
<p>Middle-aged people are not willing to be left behind. They are also very interested in records of such attractive cases. However, when they read them, they do not show the impetuosity of young people, but pretend to be very stern and cold, so that others do not know that they are reading a piece of news that can make one's heart race and blood surge.</p>
<p>Therefore, we often envy those who are judges. They can sit solemnly in front of the court, facing the man and woman in the case, questioning them about the romantic historical materials of the past, using questions that are as penetrating and all-encompassing as mercury seeping into the ground to press him and her, so that they do not dare to leave out anything and confess truthfully:—When did the relationship start, and where was it?——On such and such a day of such and such a month, another time;—and another encounter. As clear as a running account.——Imagine, what kind of attitude and tone should they have when they describe these sweet and bitter memories shyly? However, we are not judges, so we will never have the opportunity to experience all of this. We can only find the charm in the next day's newspaper and imagine the attitude of the two people at the time.</p>
<p>Since we cannot forget to read these news stories that harm morals, and yet we insist on pretending to be moralists, sighing, "Shanghai is really a place with poor morals!" in order to show our integrity, no wonder the morals of Shanghai are getting worse and worse. I have made such a determination.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Gloves from Caohéjing <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Tingyun</p>
<p>Although Caohéjing is said to be less than ten miles away from the metropolis of Shanghai, it is already a deserted area. Most of the residents make a living by farming. In addition to working in the fields, a group of women weave gloves early and late, so making gloves has become their secondary occupation.</p>
<p>Their tools are very simple. They only need a six-inch-long iron needle. This needle is made of the steel ribs of an umbrella. They thread yarn onto this needle and can weave gloves with various styles of openwork patterns. The styles are very beautiful, such as Dragon Flower Pagoda, Ruyi, pentagonal rhombus, etc. Some even draw the patterns on paper first and then weave them according to the patterns, but this kind of price is relatively more expensive, about eighty cents a pair, and the rest can be bought for fifty or sixty cents a pair. However, when work in the fields is busy, the price will also rise a bit.</p>
<p>As for the name, they do not call them gloves, but hand bags. The sales locations are concentrated in Huangjia Garden and Guanshengyuan, because there are many people who come to play in Shanghai, and they sell them to tourists. It is said that the business is quite satisfactory.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Sea <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Guiqiu</p>
<p>My hometown is on the coast of the East China Sea, where there are long embankments and a wide sea.</p>
<p>I remember when I was little, I often hid from my parents and secretly made an appointment with a few little companions to go to the beach to catch crabs, catch mudskippers, catch earthworms... If we caught a lot, we would bring them back for lunch, and the taste was more delicious than anything else.</p>
<p>Driven by life, I left my hometown and left the sea. My hometown has been separated from me for a long time; I have not seen the beauty of my hometown for a long time.</p>
<p>Recently, I went back to my hometown once. In order to find traces of my childhood, I wandered on the beach again. When I was a child, I only felt that the sea was big and wide; but now I have another concept of the sea.</p>
<p>The sea is a vast society. Here, you can sweep away your listlessness and your decadence! It will give you excitement and push you forward! Because the roar of the sea wind represents the roar of the masses; the surging of the sea water symbolizes the revolutionary upsurge!</p>
<p>The sea is a stimulant to me. I want the sea to always be my compass; always be my guiding light!</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Light Rain and Slanting Wind Still Leave Traces; Quiet Night, Alone Writing a Letter of Severance</p>
<p>After he finished writing, he reread it under the lamp. The letter contained the following passage:</p>
<p>Lan loves novels and literature. This has been the case since childhood, and she is especially impressed by Mr.'s works, which are mournful and beautiful. This can be said frankly and without any need for disguise. However, many people read and admire Mr.'s articles published in newspapers. This private admiration must also be shared by many women in their boudoirs. If Mr. knows this and compares it entirely to Western social interactions between men and women, I think he is very wrong. Who does not admire the poems of the ancients, such as Li Bai and Du Fu, and the prose of Han Yu and Su Shi? If there are women among them, would it be a laughing matter to assume that they admire Li Bai, Du Fu, Han Yu, and Su Shi? My family is a scholarly family. Although women study, they never hear about outside affairs. Mr. relies on his own speculation about the minds of young ladies in their secluded chambers and suddenly sends a letter. This not only shocks and confuses people, but also makes them doubt that someone with Mr.'s literary reputation would do such a thing.</p>
<p>He read this passage to himself four or five times. He held the letter down with both hands and stared at it blankly for a long time. He thought to himself, "These words are heavy enough. A letter of severance is nothing more than this."</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Seeing and Hearing Are Not Always Floating, Doubts Arise and Reappear; Life and Death Can Be Entrusted, Generously Sending Elegies</p>
<p>The emotional impulse of doing things in life always lasts only a short time. The longer the time, the more the emotional turmoil subsides, and then one can realize that what one has done is excessive. Such changes in thought are often found in clear-headed people. Menglan is naturally a smart person. When she received Guoqi's letter, she thought that he would actually go to her relatives' house to investigate, and also write a letter to the school to inquire. This would spread around and more people would know. This not only concerns her own reputation, but also something that her family absolutely cannot tolerate. The consequences of disapproval are hard to say. It is even possible that her life will be in danger. Therefore, based on this starting point, the more she thought about it, the more she felt that the future was terrible. She had to write a letter to cut off Guoqi's path. Therefore, based on her conscious judgment, she wrote several letters in one breath. After she finished writing, she looked at the wording of the letters herself, and it was always too intense. She felt that she had to delete and revise them. However, if she revised them to be more moderate, she would not be able to reject Guoqi's request. This left her sitting quietly under the lamp all night, unable to think of a proper solution. The last letter she wrote was very carefully written, slowly written. But after she finished writing, she spread the letter paper on the table, held her head with both hands, and quietly looked at the two lines of the letter. When she saw the important parts, she would shake her head and could not help but pick up her pen and circle those sentences. After circling them, she continued to look down, and it was still inappropriate, so she had to circle a few more sentences. (Forty-six)</p>

<h3 id="e213">Impressions of the Air Defense and Anti-Poison Knowledge Exhibition (Part 1) <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>The newspaper has repeatedly revealed that the air defense production exhibition has opened today. The venue is on the second floor of the YMCA in Ba Xian Qiao. The reporter drove to visit and met an old classmate who was involved in the preparatory work. He kindly accompanied me to view each section. Now I will write down the impressions I gained from the visit to inform the general public in Shanghai.</p>
<p>A plaque with the words "Air Defense and Anti-Poison Knowledge Exhibition" in white characters on a blue background is hung in front of the door. Turning up the stairs, you can see five airplanes of different sizes, suspended by lead wires, appearing to soar into the sky. There are also items on display on both sides of the entrance to the second floor: On the left, there are two large and small bombs. The small one is a souvenir from the January 28th Shanghai Incident. On the right, there are various anti-poison products from the Civil Chemical Industry Society, including gas masks, anti-poison rubber clothing, boots, hats, etc., all of which we have never seen before. A clay figure wearing anti-poison clothing and a hat stands at the corner of the wall, giving the audience a very profound impression. All the items are produced by the society. Various gas masks from different countries are also displayed on the table for the audience to refer to. One of them was hastily made by various rubber factories when our side feared that the enemy would release poison gas during the January 28th Shanghai Incident. It was very simple and very different from the current gas masks. However, this gas mask has become a historical souvenir and is not easy to obtain, so they feel very precious. The society has specialized personnel to explain the structure and effectiveness of various anti-poison products. Many people gathered around to listen to the lectures and visit. According to the reporter's guess, there are probably not many people who know about various anti-poison products, and there must be even fewer who have seen them.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the venue, there is an airplane set up, with alarming slogans on both sides: "We have five thousand years of history. Our ancestors have always been worthy of us!" "We have 400 million people. What good is it to have a lot of people?"</p>
<p>Most of the exhibited items in each section are displayed in the right half of the building. There are quite a few air defense charts, which are said to have been collected from the Air Defense School, Aviation School, Aviation Administration and other institutions. These are very necessary for our people who lack air defense knowledge, but unfortunately the characters are too small.</p>
<p>In addition to the various anti-poison products exhibited by the Civil Chemical Industry Society, several gas masks are also prepared in the venue for the audience to try on. There are photos and instructions on how to wear them, so you can wear them yourself without guidance. The reporter wore one and felt very uncomfortable. It is said that gas masks must be worn frequently at ordinary times, and you must take deep breaths when wearing them.</p>
<p>Now, our country can manufacture gas masks and rubber clothing and hats, and can manufacture them very well. Unfortunately, because purchasers are not enthusiastic, the cost cannot be reduced. A full set of anti-poison products costs thirty or forty yuan. This price is of course beyond the reach of the general public. Therefore, the association also has a display of anti-poison products for the public. This part tells the public several simple and emergency anti-poison methods, which are said to have considerable detoxification effects on poison gas.</p>

<p>— Junyi</p>
<p>In this year's World Games held in Berlin, there are two surprisingly small countries that officially participated. One is called Monaco and the other is called the Virgin Islands. Monaco is a small country in the south of France, with an area of only eight square miles and a population of only 22,000. It is the most famous casino in the world, and the government relies solely on gambling taxes to maintain it. As for the Virgin Islands, it is a small island in the Atlantic Ocean only seven nautical miles from New York, with an area of seventeen square miles and a population of 28,000. However, in winter, 70,000 to 80,000 foreigners come to escape the cold. There is also a special rule here: cars are not allowed to speed.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Forgot to Say <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Yachang</p>
<p>In the late Qing Dynasty, the revolution rose, and the wind rose from the clouds. Once, a foreigner said to Zhang Jingjiang: "When you are talking about revolution, it will be more powerful if you wear a red hat." Zhang smiled and said, "Of course! It's a pity that once you wear a red hat, you forget what you said." Zhang's words were very humorous, but he also saw through things. Times change people, and Yuan Shikai is an ironclad fact!</p>
<h3 id="e217">Snobbish Eyes <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>Leaving aside the internal organs of the human body, the eyes in the head are the most important organs on the outside. Although the hands are also important, the eyes always assist when using the hands in actions. When using the eyes to see, there is no need for the hands to help them, so the eyes are the supreme treasure of the human body! Astrologers call them "double-suspended suns and moons," and even more praise the eyes of beautiful women as "autumn waves" and "autumn water." There are many good names, but although the eyes are precious, they are snobbish in nature! They only worship beauty, wealth, and power. They disdain to look at the poor and powerless. Therefore, it is popularly said that the eyes rot first when people die, or perhaps this is retribution.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Interesting Facts About Mosquitoes <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Mingran</p>
<p>When it comes to dusk, mosquitoes fly everywhere as if they were in a general mobilization, and the buzzing sound is the only prelude. There are many records of this small flying insect by people of the past, but as in the "Collection of Poems from Suiyuan," the "Proclamation Against Mosquitoes" by a child says, "They come in groups, looking like bandits all over, drumming their wings and chanting loudly, with eyes full of the ghosts of essay examinations," which is borrowing the mosquito to scold people. Another example is "A Word for One Night," which compares mosquitoes to prostitutes, filling in the gaps in "Hearing the Oriole." The lyrics say, "Their name is cheap and their body is light, they love and hate when they encounter fire. Their small mouths are as sharp as blades, and they can sting people painfully. They can also heal people. Their charming voices wave the bewitching battle at night. They are so ruthless, stealing essence and sucking blood, yet they pretend to be hypocritical." It can be said that it is full of fun. In the past, Shan Shi of Qiantang Dou Shang wrote a poem about mosquitoes, "They risk their lives for blood, you are the most foolish in the world...", which can be used as a head-on school reunion drink for those who are greedy!</p>

<p>Excluding Sichuan, Xikang, Anhui, and Hunan provinces, there are a total of more than 267,000 temples and courtyards of all sizes in China, with a total of more than 738,000 monks and nuns.</p>
<p>As of the spring of 1936, there were a total of 47,000 cars in China, of which 30,107 were private cars, 10,184 were company cars, and 7,065 were trucks.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Catarrh of the Stomach and Intestines <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Summer is a time when germs are prone to breed, so there are the most diseases. Careless eating can easily lead to acute catarrh of the stomach and intestines, starting with frequent vomiting, belching of sour water, burning and bloating in the chest, abdominal cramps, or diarrhea two or three times to twenty, thirty, or forty times a day. The stool is like thin porridge or a watery liquid, which is quite easy to turn into bacillary dysentery. It should not be ignored. Moreover, for this reason, the functions of the stomach and intestines are often damaged. Although acute symptoms can be cured, they often lead to chronic diseases, such as loss of appetite, indigestion, and constipation. Therefore, it is necessary to use effective drugs to carry out fundamental treatment, so that several benefits can be achieved in one stroke.</p>
<p>For the treatment of this kind of disease, in terms of academic theory, it is necessary to quickly eliminate the inflammation of the stomach and intestines, remove the fermented substances inside, and adjust the function of its tissues, so that the symptoms can be cured without any future troubles. The pharmacological action of "Strong Stomach Essence" is based on this.

<h3 id="e221">Lymphogranuloma Venereum Blood Cell Increasing Therapy <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Dai De</p>
<p>The application of blood cell increasing therapy in the treatment of lymphogranuloma venereum has been reported in many clinical trials to date. This blood cell increasing therapy is therefore an interesting issue in the current field of lymphogranuloma venereum treatment. Recently, the general patient has gradually recognized its effect. Not only is it applied to men, but the same effect is also obtained for women with lymphogranuloma venereum. In general, for lymphogranuloma venereum, regardless of gender, many cases are difficult to treat by relying on injections into the local area. Therefore, in order to meet the needs of the enemy, it is natural to seek another new approach to treatment. According to what experience has shown us, whenever the number of white blood cells in the patient's body increases, its ability to eat bacteria will inevitably be strong, and the body's overall resistance will be greatly enhanced.</p>
<p>This therapy was originally one of non-specific treatments. The medical community did not know to apply it to internal preparations. After Peter's research, he took chemical components, prepared them into internal medicine through special operations, and doctors praised it and patients praised it. It really opened up a new realm for the treatment of lymphogranuloma venereum.</p>
<p>It is found that this preparation is the "Kelinong" holy medicine for lymphogranuloma venereum, which is popular in various countries today. Heuck said that it has a cure rate of 70-90%, and Rieger also reported that the cure rate for women with lymphogranuloma venereum is 95%. As for the efficacy of "Kelinong", it is good at treating acute and chronic gonorrhea and systemic toxic arthritis, inflammation of the prostate, bladder, and testicles in men, and urethritis, vulvitis, and cervical lymphogranuloma venereum in women. Once taken, the body will change and gain strong resistance, and finally be completely cured. Its medicinal properties are peaceful, so there is no damage to the stomach and any stimulation. However, when purchasing, do not mistakenly purchase miscellaneous brands of cheap goods due to others' ignorance and deception, which may affect your life after taking them. Be sure to pay attention to the three companies of "Kelinong"!</p>
<h3 id="e222">Youth and Old Age <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>Why do people grow old?</p>
<p>Why people grow old is truly a very interesting question, and also a question that concerns everyone personally. People only know that there is a difference between young and old due to age, but they do not know that it is actually due to the relationship of hormones in physiology. In our pre-pubescent stage, except for the reproductive parts, there is no difference between the sexes. Until the period of adolescent development, the function of internal secretion begins to flourish. All parts of the body are irrigated by hormones, and thus there is a distinction between male and female. As one grows older, the function of internal secretion gradually declines, and thus everything presents symbols of aging. However, many young men and women, during this period of youth, are often stimulated by hormones and tempted by external inducements, developing the bad habit of masturbation, thus stunting their development. This leads them to enter the realm of old age in their youth. Furthermore, they may experience incomplete development of the lower body, nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, insufficient erectile strength, and for women, difficult menstruation, leucorrhea, and breasts and buttocks as flat as those of men. And both sexes share symptoms such as prolonged marriage without pregnancy, dizziness, palpitations, insomnia, weakened memory, lower back pain and weak legs, slow movement, gray hair and wrinkled face, all exhibiting signs of old age.</p>
<p>Since this condition is caused by weak internal secretion function, internal secretion therapy has recently become popular, but its effectiveness is not significant. However, Meilun's method of "Buti Kang" for men and "Bu Nü Rong" for women is remarkably effective in treating early aging and the various symptoms mentioned above, far beyond what ordinary hormone preparations can achieve. The raw materials are extracted from vigorous animals during their reproductive period using scientific methods, and are made from testicular and ovarian hormones. After taking it, it is distributed throughout the body through the blood, which can promote vigorous internal secretion function. Not only can incomplete development and menstrual disorders be cured, but also those who are prematurely aging will benefit. Therefore, doctors in Western countries are competing to use it, praising it as the "youth gland" for men and women.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Leucorrhea is Not a Minor Ailment <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Generally, women often neglect leucorrhea as an unimportant minor ailment, which is actually a big mistake. Many dangerous symptoms often arise from minor ailments. Leucorrhea easily leads to major problems because the area is moist, which is most conducive to the survival and reproduction of bacteria. Once invaded by gonococci and pyogenic bacteria, it can severely damage the tissues of that area, often resulting in a mixture of blood and pus, local erosion, abdominal distension, painful urination, and a staggering gait, which is extremely embarrassing, leading to mental exhaustion and a sallow complexion. The beauty of health is thus lost.</p>
<p>"Carolle Snow's Vaginal Tablets" are a self-treatment method for radically curing leucorrhea. Whether it is long-term or newly onset leucorrhea, it is very suitable for use, with the effects of resisting secretions, restoring tissues, destroying bacteria, and reducing inflammation. Every night before going to bed, insert one tablet deep inside and wash it off the next morning. However, for those with leucorrhea due to physical weakness, "Bu Nü Rong" can also be taken. For those infected by their husbands with gonorrhea, "Ke Lin Nong" can also be taken to eliminate internal gonococcal toxins. With such treatment, effectiveness can be achieved in a short period of time, and it can be prevented from recurring permanently after recovery, allowing for normal childbirth.</p>
<h3 id="e224">The Most Effective Gonorrhea Medicine <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>A Noteworthy Invention!</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is one of the most prevalent civilization diseases in recent times. In the largest cities, the number of gonorrhea patients is also the highest. Regarding the treatment of this disease, dye injections were previously used, but their effectiveness was often uncertain, or due to poor manufacturing, the side effects were very large. Therefore, it was not very satisfactory. Thus, the discovery of an effective drug for treating gonorrhea has not yet been made.</p>
<p>However, due to scientific progress in recent years, diseases that were previously considered difficult to treat can now be radically cured with medicine. The invention of "Ke Lin Nong" is one such example. The inventor of "Ke Lin Nong," Mr. Peter, devoted his life's efforts to creating it. It has been tested on animals with extremely satisfactory results. It can produce an anti-gonococcal substance in the body and directly exert a bactericidal effect on the lesions without damaging healthy parts. The most outstanding feature is that it has no irritating, vomiting, or stomach-upsetting side effects. It invariably cures radically in a short period of time after taking it. Whether it is acute or chronic gonorrhea, and complications, sequelae, etc., such as burning and stinging in the urethra, acute gonorrhea with redness and swelling of the glans and foreskin, as well as prostatitis, orchitis, anterior and posterior urethritis, and for women, gonococcal leucorrhea, all achieve remarkable effects quickly. Its superior results surpass any gonorrhea medicine, so major clinical trial experts in Europe and the United States are competing to use it. Recently, many Chinese physicians in our country have also adopted it.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Dr. Deng Yuanhe's Brief Talk on Lung Disease <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>

<p>Changing Location and Home Care for Lung Disease</p>
<p>For people suffering from lung disease, it is certainly advisable to leave their careers and free their minds from family worries. Therefore, changing locations can also make them feel happy and improve their appetite. However, if there are no particularly suitable places for recuperation, such as the coast or high altitudes, then changing locations may not be necessary. If the patient can overcome any emotions with a strong will and maintain their normal life, then home care can also achieve the hope of recovery. However, air and quiet therapy must be followed. That is, the indoor air should be kept circulating, but avoid catching a cold, so it is not advisable to lie in a place directly exposed to the wind. On the one hand, absolute quiet is required to avoid excitement of the nerves. Secondly, taking special medicine requires persistent perseverance, avoiding fickleness and seeing different things and changing your mind. After all, lung disease is a chronic disease, and how can you expect it to be cured if you do not take medicine for more than half a month to a month?</p>
<p>The healing of lung disease depends entirely on the proliferation of connective tissue to surround the tubercle bacilli in the lungs. If this defense mechanism is strong, the bacteria will have no way to breed, and thus will gradually die out. The formation of connective tissue requires continuous administration of calcium.</p>
<p>Among calcium preparations, a mixture of calcium chloride and iodine is most effective for treating tuberculosis. "Bu Fei Na Er" is the best among them. Its tonic power is directly comparable to cod liver oil, but it is hot and does not have the drawback of stagnation. Its nature is peaceful and especially suitable for weak people to take, effectively treating coughs and phlegm in pulmonary tuberculosis, as well as coughing up blood and bloody phlegm, chest tightness, reduced appetite, chest pain, night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss. Because it contains gelatin oil that is good at removing phlegm and cough, it has remarkable effects on chronic coughs, stubborn phlegm, asthma, shortness of breath, whooping cough in children, and colds, as repeatedly proven by doctors. For those who have been suffering from lung tuberculosis for a long time with neurasthenia, insomnia, palpitations, and women's menstrual disorders, and men's nocturnal emission and kidney deficiency, in addition to taking this medicine, they can also take "Bu Ti Kang" for men to strengthen the kidneys and consolidate the essence, and "Bu Nü Rong" for women to regulate menstruation and nourish blood, so that weakness can be easily restored to strength, and weight and spirit will definitely increase day by day.</p>
<h3 id="e226">A Collection of Cases Treated with "Ke Lin Nong" <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Lingering Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Lian Pingshan was troubled by gonorrhea, and after repeated medical treatments, all were ineffective. Thick discharge dripped continuously, the urine was sometimes clear and sometimes turbid, and the anus and perineum ached. After drinking alcohol or exertion, the shoulder bones, joints, etc., would also often ache. His wife also contracted this disease, resulting in a lot of leucorrhea and vaginal ulcers. The couple were both sick, making them feel doubly pitiful. Later, introduced by a friend, they went to Dr. Dai De for treatment. Dr. Dai believed it was chronic prostatitis. In addition to a little massage, he instructed them to take "Ke Lin Nong" to reduce inflammation, promote urination, relieve pain, and eliminate gonorrhea. They were completely cured after taking it for four or five weeks. His wife also took "Ke Lin Nong" internally and Carole Snow's Vaginal Tablets externally for three or four weeks and recovered. Afterwards, after a dozen blood tests, it was proven that there was no gonococcal reaction. Therefore, Mr. Lian and his wife have lived together for several years and have not relapsed.</p>
<p>Sudden Recurrence</p>
<p>Previously suffering from acute gonorrhea, he had taken two bottles of "Ke Lin Nong" and recovered, but there were still a few gonococcal threads in his urine. Mr. Jin thought he was cured and continued to drink alcohol and exert himself as before. Unexpectedly, the symptoms suddenly changed, the urine became turbid, the gonococcal threads increased, urination was quite uncomfortable, and there was lower abdominal pain. He appeared very anxious, so he sought treatment from gonorrhea expert Dr. Yao Juyan, who believed it was gonococcal cystitis. In addition to surgery and electrical therapy, he also ordered him to purchase "Ke Lin Nong" to clear gonococcal toxins and promote the internal elimination of inflammation. It was only after about four weeks of treatment that he was able to achieve full efficacy. Afterwards, although he repeatedly underwent severe stimulation such as drinking alcohol and exertion, he never had any symptoms of gonococcal toxicity, so he was relieved to believe that he was radically cured.</p>
<p>Weak Body Disturbed by Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Qiu Tianyun was weak and sickly, and later suffered from gonorrhea, resulting in nocturnal emission. Therefore, his body felt extremely tired and abnormal. He had taken a certain gonorrhea medicine, but felt dizzy and nauseous in his heart, so he stopped taking it. Later, he heard that the special gonorrhea medicine "Ke Lin Nong" had the effect of eliminating gonorrhea, so he bought it and took it. After taking two bottles, his urine became clear and his perineum felt comfortable. He cured his many years of illness after taking it for a week. However, the symptoms of physical weakness and nocturnal emission were still present. After diagnosis by Dr. Chen Shaohua, he was instructed to take three bottles of "Bu Ti Kang" and recovered. His body became stronger than before, and he often praised these two medicines as his life-saving stars.</p>
<p>Testicular Swelling</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Zhang Fengqi suffered from gonorrhea that was not treated properly, and subsequently developed orchitis. His right testicle was swollen, as large as a small fist. It felt hard to the touch. This one testicle had lost its reproductive ability. Fortunately, the left testicle was diseased but had not deteriorated to the point of worsening. Dr. Yao Juyan made efforts to save it. On the one hand, he instructed him to take "Ke Lin Nong" to reduce inflammation and kill bacteria. After more than a month of treatment, he was finally cured. Later, he married a certain lady and was fortunate enough to have a son.</p>

<h3 id="e227">Treatment of Nocturnal Emission <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Nocturnal emission is so-called seminal emission with dreams. Its cause is excessive masturbation or sexual frustration. The patient's essence is prematurely depleted, the muscles are tense, and the vas deferens is relaxed. If the pathological changes worsen, there will be emission without dreams, and even during bowel movements or exertion, essence will leak out. Accompanied by dizziness, headache, and weakened memory, it must be cured as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The treatment of this disease focuses on calming the nerves. Local drug treatment alone is useless. Nai Shi's "Yu Jing Pian" has such great effects, because its main effect is calming, and it is a special medicine for treating seminal emission and weakness caused by seminal emission.</p>

<p>— Meng Hua</p>
<p>"Since you've been born, then live on, struggle on to live"! I see these words on everyone's face.</p>
<p>In the morning, when the thick fog hasn't dissipated, the street cleaner in the red uniform pushes the garbage truck towards Xī'ān Gate. There is a mountain of garbage there. On top of this garbage pile, there are dirty sows, greedily chewing on the moldy vegetable leaves, wagging their tiny tails. There are also dogs with drooping tails, crows and sparrows that fly down in a hurry and then fly away again, flies buzzing and chewing on the festering sores on the children's heads.</p>
<p>"Ding lang, ding lang--" The little bell hanging on the cart handle rings. The fog hasn't cleared yet, so you can't see any figures, only hear the particularly heavy sound of the bell in the fog. The children fly down from the pile of dirt, waiting and waiting.</p>
<p>As soon as the garbage is dumped, they concentrate on picking through it, their eyes fixed, grabbing with their hands, muttering in their mouths. Sometimes they also touch the sores on their heads and joints with dirty hands, where flies are holding a grand feast... Seen in the fog, they look like a group of ghosts, their voices as hoarse as those who have strained their vocal cords. What are they busy with? What are they doing it for?</p>
<p>The fathers of those children might be coolies, or rickshaw pullers, or workers, or maybe they don't have fathers at all. Who knows? But I believe that some of them are the sons of rickshaw pullers. During the hot summer days and cold winters, when the north wind is howling on the streets, swirling up gusts of dust, these fathers will curl up their bodies, open their mouths, and beg every passerby:</p>
<p>"Want a ride? I'll take you"!</p>
<p>Dust seeps into their mouths, sticking to their throats. But when another passerby comes along, they gaze at him with eager eyes, asking in a plaintive tone: "Sir, I'll take you"! At night, their voices are more like those of an old woman leading souls on the road. What are they busy with? What are they doing it for?</p>
<p>Maybe they also have young wives and young daughters. Maybe their wives and daughters, when the streetlights begin to shine brightly, dress up coquettishly and go to the market, using seductive eyes to tempt those single men. On the street, I see them. They always stand evasively in dark places, hiding in the shadows of the telephone poles, telling you in low voices: "Sir, have pity on me"!</p>
<p>Why do they stand in places without lights? Why are their voices so plaintive? Why do the hands they stretch out tremble? Why do they abandon their homes, leaving their relatives, their children, and running to this street in the dark night? I also remember winter nights. The night is so quiet and so cold. But in the corners of the alleys, there are often bursts of selling cries:</p>
<p>"Radishes as sweet as pears--spicy, come and trade!" "Sugar-coated cakes--cakes, oh cakes"!</p>

<p>— Cheng Xiuyang</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the old grandmother put on a sky-blue linen dress and went to the entrance of the village, leaning on her dragon-headed cane. She was so excited, as if her granddaughter had gone missing. She forgot the beads of sweat hanging from her forehead, she forgot the corns on her toes throbbing faintly, and like a young girl, she ran to the Five Mile Pavilion in one breath and sat down to rest.</p>
<p>In this town, the old grandmother is known as a woman with good fortune. In fact, because she is usually charitable and kind, and people in the town who have benefited from her just call her a woman with good fortune. Her only son died at the age of thirty, and within a year, his wife also passed away. An old grandmother, like a mother, had to raise the grandson and granddaughter left behind. Whenever she heard someone call her a woman with good fortune, she would always answer with red eyes: "Bad fate! I couldn't even raise a son until the end of his life"!</p>
<p>She finally raised a pair of siblings across "generations." Both of the children without parents listened to the old grandmother. When they were sent to school in the town, the old grandmother who was raising two generations became happy again like in her daughter-in-law days. Every night, under the kerosene lamp, she would put on her wide-rimmed old glasses and help the two children review their evening lessons. But when she often discovered that the primary school students had so many textbooks, she would sigh again:</p>
<p>"It's a different generation, it's really a different generation! There are so many lessons in foreign schools"?</p>
<p>Then she remembered a Three Character Classic when her son was studying. The teacher taught two sentences every day, but he still couldn't memorize them. Now the children have to read so many books, and those books are something she doesn't understand. She felt that the times were passing too quickly, but the children's liveliness and innocence were exactly like their father's, as if the times were forever stuck in her daughter-in-law days. She entrusted what she had hoped for in her son to the two children.</p>
<p>The children grew up as she had hoped. They went from elementary school to high school, and then to the city to study in middle school. But going to study in the city didn't satisfy her. She said she wasn't against going to foreign schools to study? But I have been raising the two children since they were young, and they can't leave me. They have to stay at school, and they have to do everything themselves, like making the bed and folding the quilt. Can the two children handle these things? The children's uncle came out to persuade her.</p>
<p>"Today's children are not like before. It's easy to make two round trips to the city every day. And now there is a holiday in school, and they can come home every six days. The children are very smart, and when they graduate from middle school in the future, they will be as prestigious as a scholar"!</p>
<p>Scholar, what a tempting name! This town has produced a total of two scholars, one of whom was her son. She agreed to let the siblings live and study in the city. She kept the scholar in her mouth: "Graduating from foreign school is a scholar, and my granddaughter will be a female scholar." She often woke up from dreams laughing.</p>
<p>But an incomprehensible "trend" took her female scholar away. This news caused a sensation in the whole town, and those who didn't care spoke coldly:</p>
<p>"What's the good of foreign schools? They specialize in making trouble, what is free love, isn't it just having affairs? It's really embarrassing for the town for a good family's daughter to do such a shameless thing"!</p>
<p>The old lady cried and shouted that she was suffering. She put on a blue linen dress like she was going crazy, and went to the foreign school in the city with her dragon-headed cane, wanting them to hand over her granddaughter. Finally, at the Five Mile Pavilion, she was dragged back by her neighbors. She didn't seem to be able to get over this, and rushed to her uncle's house, pointing at the uncle's forehead with her cane and scolding:</p>
<p>"Your sister died so miserably, and she left these two children, but you insisted on sending them to foreign school. You said, you said, you deceived me, an old woman, to be a scholar, and now people are gone. Give me back my granddaughter..."</p>
<p>She fell to the ground, hitting the stone bricks with her cane until she was exhausted. Many people persuaded her to go home.</p>
<p>The loss of the female scholar immediately affected the younger brother's education problem. The younger brother had already graduated from middle school, but the old grandmother who was raising two generations now refused to allow him to enter university no matter what. Going to university meant going to the provincial capital, and he would only come home twice a year during the winter and summer vacations. He had already caused trouble in the city, how could I control him if he went to the provincial capital? We only have this one child in our family! The old grandmother now rejected her grandson's request with righteous indignation.</p>
<p>That uncle still made the greatest effort to complete his nephew's studies. He endured countless venomous accusations from the old grandmother, and finally:</p>
<p>"...Girls will run away with other people, what will boys do? This town has never had a child who has gone to university before. This is not only your old lady's good fortune, but also the glory of this town! I want to compare it to the past again, it's simply like passing the imperial examination"! This is how he persuaded her.</p>
<p>The grandson came home twice every winter and summer vacation, and the old grandmother who was raising two generations still asked him about everything like he was in elementary school. When she saw so many thick foreign books, she put on her wide-rimmed old glasses to look at the lines of crab-like characters, and the name "foreign scholar" churned in her mind again. "That's right, what will boys do? Girls' hearts are outward-facing, it's always good to raise sons. A foreign scholar." Although she felt a slight sadness when she thought that her son had died too early. "I want to live a few more years, this grandson is whom I've raised since he was little, let me see him become a foreign scholar." She burned incense and prayed to her Guanyin Bodhisattva every day.</p>
<p>She was still so healthy. When she received the letter from her grandson saying that he had graduated from university and was coming home, she put on her sky-blue linen dress and ran to the Five Mile Pavilion in one breath. Whenever she met someone familiar coming towards her, she would answer that person's question, "My child graduated from university, he's become a foreign scholar!" She walked forward laughing.</p>
<p>The child came back, he was wearing foreign clothes, sitting in a rattan sedan as if he were the magistrate on patrol in the past, but in the rattan sedan behind him was a woman that this town had never seen before. The child told the old grandmother that she was his newly married granddaughter-in-law.</p>
<p>A bolt from the blue—what would boys do? Wasn't that just like having an affair? The same, the same, the down is dry and they want to fly outward, my life is bitter! When the old grandmother felt that all her hopes had been dashed, she thought of her son who died at the age of thirty, and cried loudly in front of his spirit tablet...</p>
<h3 id="e230">People Who Do Not Attend to Proper Business <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Xiangdong</p>
<p>The people in the village all dislike Guo Desheng: this goes without saying because he does not attend to proper business. Regarding him, various discussions can be heard from time to time in teahouses and among gossiping village women. Some attribute Guo Desheng's downfall to his mother. This old woman has always doted on her son since he was little, and therefore always shielded him no matter what, refusing to discipline him properly. For example, once Guo Desheng harassed a woman on the road, and she loudly scolded him; but his mother, upon hearing this, came out to defend him, saying that the woman herself was indecent; why would Guo Desheng harass her and not someone else—she defended her son to everyone in this way—isn't this evidence that the woman is indecent? But everyone knew that Guo Desheng liked to do such vulgar things, so they responded with cold laughter. Thus, his</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>mother had no choice but to quickly arrange a marriage for her son: Guo Desheng is now a married man. Some people thought that Guo Desheng was born bad; in the future, he might even do worse things. In the village, people who valued themselves even slightly avoided him; they did not associate with him. Guo Desheng's friends, needless to say, were only opium smokers or gamblers.</p>
<p>Gambler Fang Aqiang was a very close friend of Guo Desheng. He began to take Guo Desheng to gambling dens, enticing him to gamble. Seeing gambling there as a good way to get rich, he completely immersed himself in it. He lost all the money he and his mother had; he was very frustrated. Fang Aqiang, however, said to him, "Your gambling method is wrong; you need more capital to succeed." Hearing these words, Guo Desheng thought in his heart that this might be true; and since he had to win back the money he had lost, he returned to his home, where he had not been for three days.</p>
<p>Guo Desheng's wife was a virtuous woman; at home, she fulfilled her responsibilities as a daughter-in-law. However, her husband's neglect of proper business made her very sad. She did her best to persuade him to change his current absurd life, but to no avail. This evening, Guo Desheng returned. At first, he was much gentler than before, asking her for money; but when she asked what he needed it for, he could not answer. Moreover, she really had no money. Gradually, Guo Desheng became impatient, and he insisted on getting it; even her jewelry would do. She refused, resisting his forceful robbery. As a result, she was pushed to the floor. Raising his head, her husband revealed a fierce face, pointing at her and scolding, "You vile woman! If you don't listen to me, I'll kick you to death!" The woman began to sob, which made him even more unbearable. Raising his foot, he kicked her back. She fell down again. Then, disregarding everything, he snatched her keys, opened the cabinet, and took all the jewelry she had brought with her when she married and exchanged it for gambling money. He then went to find Fang Aqiang and returned to that place.</p>
<p>This time, I must win back what I lost, Guo Desheng thought in his heart. He stayed there until the next morning. Unexpectedly, he lost everything again.</p>
<p>Fang Aqiang truly deserved to be called an old gambler. Seeing Guo Desheng looking dejected, he walked over, patted him on the shoulder, and said, "What's wrong? You look like a defeated soldier! Desheng, winning and losing are common occurrences for soldiers. You mustn't lose heart! Go get some more money and try again. If luck comes your way, it will be incredible!" Guo Desheng turned his face and gave him a smile, but how bitter that smile was.</p>
<p>Gradually, Guo Desheng became a well-known gambler in the village. The fate of the virtuous daughter-in-law had reached its darkest point. She began to fall silent, not responding to him and no longer trying to persuade him with earnest words. Everything in the house had been secretly pawned off by Guo Desheng; even his doting mother shed tears at this. Before long, the old mother, unable to bear the worries caused by her son's neglect of proper business, quietly passed away one night in a drizzling autumn rain, without even a groan, abandoning her son and daughter-in-law. At the moment of her death, she spoke in a repentant tone, saying intermittently, "I was wrong!... My whole life was wrong!... Desheng, if you don't repent, I really... Desheng, you must properly... properly advise your husband who neglects proper business!" The young daughter-in-law only shook her head, her eyes filled with tears, watching her mother-in-law close her eyes, forever ceasing the beating of her heart. At this time, Guo Desheng also occasionally thought about repenting, and he did not go to the gambling den for two days. However, he was a notorious bad guy, and who would give him a chance to reform? So, when the gambler Fang Aqiang appeared before him again, he took the only winter cotton robe he had left and went out again.</p>
<p>Seeing that her husband would never turn back, and that the house was completely empty, the young daughter-in-law felt that everything was empty and hopeless. On a night when Guo Desheng did not return, she hanged herself. This tragedy caused Guo Desheng to be despised and cursed by the villagers; until one day, this person who did not attend to proper business suddenly disappeared. Where he went, even Fang Aqiang did not know. "Let such a person disappear from our village forever," people said. Indeed, Guo Desheng never returned; now, his dilapidated house has collapsed.</p>

<p>Zhou Zhenyu's Tale of Righteous Demons</p>
<p>Yuan Chang (1120) 12:45 AM to 1:30 AM</p>
<p>Opening: "Kongming"</p>
<p>Mr. Zhuge, known as Kongming, had the division of the empire in his chest. Ever since the Battle of Bowang, he was almost used by Cao's army to attack with fire. First, he issued the order to Zhao Zilong, stirring heroes with three drum beats. There was also Zhang Yide, who said he had been trapped in Longzhong for a long time. He regretted that his elder brother listened to Xu Yuanzhi, hiring a farmer from Wolonggang three times. Zhang Fei was scared. Relying on your fast horse and sharp spear, you did not succeed in capturing the Cao bandits. Xiahou Dun forced his way through Anlin Road, injuring one of his eyes, making it difficult to repay the debt. The master had already decided in his chest that Xiahou Dun's lifespan had not yet ended. From then on, Zhang Fei admired him in his heart, watching how he repaid his debt. What face did he have to ask forgiveness with thorns?</p>

<p>Zhongxi (1040) 10:00 AM to 10:45 AM</p>
<p>Opening: "Zhaojun"</p>
<p>The tale of a woman who could topple cities and states has been told for thousands of years. Wang Qiang's posture was wonderfully extraordinary. Three thousand beauties had no color. Even the moon lingered and the flowers were ashamed. Unexpectedly, the Xiongnu chieftain heard of her beauty, and the emperor granted her to him for the sake of peace. Although there was sufficient food and elite troops, the civil and military officials found it difficult to resist the enemy. In the harem, how many daughters of good families were there? I alone received favor and left the Han Pass. The emperor himself called the palace mistress, sending her off to marry a foreign barbarian for life. The road ahead was long and the return journey was far. It was easy to say goodbye, but difficult to meet again. Before leaving, she bid farewell to Zhaoyang Palace, clutching her hands and shedding tears. The emperor personally bid her farewell with wine at the pavilion, and she could not drink the wine in the cup for tears. The Han family relied on me to secure the country, and the officials knelt in two rows. Riding a fine horse, with fluttering flags and banners, she crossed the carved saddle in the attire of an inner court official. From then on, there would be no day to meet again, and there was no hope of returning to life in this life. She experienced thousands and tens of thousands of mountains.</p>

<p>In view of the importance of women's education, in order to enable women to increase practical knowledge in entertainment, it is now scheduled from July 13 (Monday), every Monday afternoon from 5:15 to 5:30, Miss Hu Shen will be specially invited to host the women's program. All practical knowledge of women's daily life and general knowledge will be broadcast as much as possible, so that women in general families can acquire living knowledge above the standard, so as to achieve the practical benefits of broadcast education, and to change the decadent life of women who only know how to play mahjong and listen to low-level broadcasts. In order to facilitate the inquiry of women, the station has specially created an item of "Women's Correspondence" from now on, and welcomes women from this and other ports to directly send letters of inquiry. The rules of this item are as follows: All listeners are welcome to send letters of inquiry about various practical problems related to women and the daily housework life of women: Each letter is limited to three questions: The correspondence must be attached with sufficient return postage stamps; If the correspondence is general, it should be broadcast in the air, so that the majority of women can get appropriate guidance at the same time; If listeners raise various practical problems of women in their letters, and it is worthy of public discussion, they will be carefully studied in the air to achieve the benefit of mutual encouragement; Correspondence should be sent to the "Women's Correspondence Office", No. 137 Sassoon Building, Shanghai Traffic Department Radio Station, and do not write personal names.</p>
<p>Since the prevalence of self-broadcasting in Shanghai, opera groups have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain, and they have become increasingly numerous. However, they are isolated and have no contact with each other. It is always difficult to deal with affairs with one heart and one mind. Recently, various groups such as Datong, Furong, Shanghai, and Yifeng have organized a sound "Shanghai Dance and Drama Association" in order to facilitate the study of the progress of dance art and to discuss the development of business. It is also heard that a joint symposium of all opera groups in Shanghai will be held at the National Primary School at 9 am on the 12th of this month to jointly discuss all the steps of preparing for the organization. It is expected that there will be a new atmosphere in the dance in the future.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Xinkai, an expert in Chinese studies, was hired by Tian Xiaode Medicine, Li Da Wang, Daoxiangcun Zheng Da Wang, and Mao Shi Optical Company to give lectures on the states at the Guohua Radio Station. From July 1st, from 3:00 to 3:40 pm, please pay attention to all walks of life.</p>

<h3 id="e236">Anniversary of Two Artists' Death <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Qingjian composer Nie Er drowned in Japan, and the 18th of this month is the anniversary of his death. Over the past year. The oppression of the enemy has become more and more serious, and the roars of people who are unwilling to be slaves have also increased in direct proportion. In this upsurge of popular movement, progressive songs are very popular among the people. In every mass gathering, those abundant songs are repeatedly sung by the masses, and Mr. Nie Er's songs such as "Graduation Song" are even more welcomed by the masses.</p>
<p>In order to commemorate this great composer, the city's Songwriters Association, Chinese Poetry Society, Roaring Singing Troupe, Roaring Singing Troupe, Amateur Singing Team, New Voice Choir, Ant Society Singing Society, Public Education Hall Singing Troupe, Minzhi Middle School Singing Class, Mass Singing Society, Time Singing Troupe, Pingliang Road Singing Troupe, Hualong Road Singing Troupe, Eight Immortals Bridge Mass Singing Society, and Liangcai Singing Society have jointly launched a commemorative conference on the anniversary of his death. In addition to reporting on Nie Er's life and singing all his works, it is fair to prepare to sing the patriotic songs made by others in front of his grave. "Because various items are in progress and need to be prepared urgently," they borrowed Minzhi Middle School to hold the first preparatory meeting at 7:30 pm yesterday. We will report on the results of the meeting later.</p>
<p>The anniversary of Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu's death has already arrived. August 2nd (July 16th in the lunar calendar) is an unforgettable tragic anniversary for the colleagues of the Star Company and even the Chinese film audience. The Star colleagues will all go to the Pure Land Nunnery, the place where Mr. Zhengqiu's coffin is placed, to hold a solemn anniversary sacrifice. As for the issue of Mr. Zheng's burial, it is being discussed by Mr. Zhengqiu's family and the Chaozhou Fellow Association.</p>

<p>China's first masterpiece of child stars, "My Diary," has been published. The content describes all kinds of anecdotes during the filming of "The Lost Lamb" in Suzhou, especially about Cai Chusheng and Chen Juanjuan. There are also many copperplate prints. Each issue only sells for 1.2 cents of national currency. Postage stamps are commonly used for correspondence purchases. Qianqiu Publishing House, No. 4, Lane 153, South of Kad Road Post Office, Shanghai, publishes it.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Introducing the Famous Literary Work "The Adventures of Pinocchio in Africa" <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>The illustrated novel "The Adventures of Pinocchio in Africa" is one of the world's famous works of juvenile literature and is comparable to "The Adventures of Pinocchio". The content describes a wooden puppet's adventure into Africa to explore the wonders, experiencing various dangerous, strange and interesting encounters, from not knowing how to do it to becoming an emperor, from an emperor to a slave, and finally escaping this dark Africa. Therefore, it is tortuous, humorous, and of great educational value. The original author is Italy's Xue Lübini, and it is said that it has now been translated into Chinese by Jiang Manru (and has been revised by Mr. Wang Tianran). The translation is unusually prosperous and lively. Children and adults should read it, and there are eighteen illustrations in the book, which add a lot of interest. The entire book is more than two hundred pages thick and is finely printed in regular script. The actual price of each book is only 70 cents. The Reading World Bookstore at 314 Jinshenfu Road publishes it, and the Life Bookstore and Shanghai Magazine Company also sell it.</p>
