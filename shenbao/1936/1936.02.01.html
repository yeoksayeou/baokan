<p>內政之一段、略謂「新政府具有妥恊性質、同時對於共和政制、仍將維護不懈、其所抱計劃至為廣大、而其主要任務、則為主持下屆衆議院選舉、務使此項選舉獲得種種保障、卽政府將持以正直不偏之精神、並尊重投票與輿論之自由是也、至在</p>
<p>經濟方面、則政府務必振興一切經濟活動、俾得改善財政狀况、蓋欲保障法郎之地位、財政狀况急待政府加以整頓也」、薩勞之</p>
<p>結論日、政府所採政策、其大綱約為下列數端、卽　公民享受和平、　全國人民嚴守紀律、　使國家法律具有最高之權力、蓋惟有公共治安與街上秩序獲得尊重之後、復興事業之物質上與精神上各項條件、始能實現也、國家之威權、惟政府得掌之、保障公民安寗之軍警、亦惟政府得以調動之、政府以維護法國無上利益為職責、對於擾亂安寗者將加以禁止、其有破壞安寗者、將予懲處、此項職責决將嚴格履行、不稍隕越、凡屬共和主義者必能為政府之後盾也、」最後薩勞總理申請全國人民持以鎭靜、勿作磁何冒昧行動、「則不僅國內發生擾亂、卽外患則亦相繼而來、可不愼哉」云云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>「二十五史補編」序</h3>
<p>— 顧露剛</p>
<p>「吾華有五千年之歷史！」此國人常作之自豪語也。問以史何在，必將曰：二十四史不充棟乎？增以新兀史為二十五，不尤富乎？然史之可貴，匪特在其卷帙之繁重，叙述之詳明，裁斷之有制，叉當字字有來歷，其所根據之原料可得而勘證，示人以必信焉。自趙宋而下，修史時所根據者今雖不可盡見，而政府公文，地方志乘，私家著述，存留者並多，猶得藉是以審察其然吾。若上溯唐。五代之前，刻版未興，直接史料亡失垂盡，固亦有刧餘之金石遺文及故書雅記在，然而其物過於零星，未足以供系統之探討；霄史事者惟有據十七史為惟一之資源。所謂五千年之晞史，前四千年祇此而已，此無可奈何者也。</p>
<p>治中國史學者之不能捨棄歷代正史旣如此，而正史中之表志，於典章之沿革，人事之變遷，各盡其貫穿綜合之任務，使讀之者對於歷史現象有整個之認識，則更為此資源中之眞精實髓。原表志之體創於司馬遷，雖亦有所因，而與紀傳相輔以作全書之綱領，則其前未嘗有也。夫表之為用不僅旁行斜上，而在乎鉤玄提要；志之為用亦不惟整齊故事，而在乎原始要終。人事前後相循，不容隨朝代而割裂，故每代一史，本非其宜；然古今作史者縱自以為成一家之言，而在讀史者視之，則實為綿延相承之作。（鄭樵深譏斷代之史，因自作通志以變其體，然通志紀傳而今無讀之者，固由其材料不能出前人之外，亦以世人視各種斷代史之彙合即為通史耳。）若一史之中，表志有闕，則讀史者目之所觸，惟有林林總總之故事浮動於前，無由得其綱領，而前後相循之人事亦為之斷而不續矣！</p>
<p>正史不皆有表志。二五史中，表志齊備者，惟史記。（稱書不稱志）漢書。新唐書。宋史·遼史·金史·元史·新元史·明史等九種；其有志而無表者，則有後漢書·晉書·宋書。南齊書·魏書·隋書·舊五代史·新五代史（稱考不稱志）等九種。自餘三國志·梁書·陳書·北齊書·北周書·南史·北史等七種，則並一表一志而無之。此無表無志之七種與有志無表之九種，共不能稱為完善自不待論；即就其有表有志者觀之，作者之學識與其所取之材料俱未嘗無瑕可指。故若曰「二十五史多缺憾，」此固平心之論，非吾輩之有意輕侮古人也。</p>
<p>此種缺憾，古今學者感到者至多；為欲彌縫之，是以相率起任補正與考釋之工作。凡前史有而後史無者，則補後史，若萬斯同·錢大昭·洪飴孫之補表是也；後史有而前史無者，則補前史，若錢文子·錢儀吉之補兵志是也。（案兩錢氏補兵志固未能下接兩唐，然實用後世史籍體例。）至於會通前後，卓然自立，若梁玉繩之於古今人表，章宗源·姚振宗之於隋書經籍志，則志在冶數代於一鑪，而不僅依傍一史。此融貫諸史事實，其可貴者一也。諸史表志之中，闕漏違迕，所在而有。闕漏則當補，違迕則當正。若吳卓信之於漢地理志，溫曰鑑之於魏地形志，致力之深，凌駕前哲。此作古人之諍友，其可貴者二也。至於校正之事，為術雖微，其效則顯，得是爬梳，書乃可讀，是亦有不廢之功矣。</p>
<p>正史之缺憾，賴古今學者之努力，受其彌縫者巳不在少數，後人儘可利用已有之成績而作進一步之探求。但此已有之成績，將何從而求得之？憶十年前，頡剛好治目錄學，於各史，詫為奇觀，以為淸人考史之害網羅盡矣。稍長，好聚目錄，乃知此類書未刋者尙多。及遊學北平，往還之師友多治史者，益見珍秘之籍，而惜其不得彙合於一編。私計學海之後復有南菁，不審廣雅之作亦有嗣音者乎？顧瞻八表，實勞我心，今春過滬，於開明書店見二十五史補編之目，知舊友王伯祥先生（鍾麒）主持斯事，俾與縮本二十五史並行，以便讀史者之相互勘證，從此無患乎原書之闕漏，亦無惑乎原書之違迕；搜羅之博，遠軼廣雅，凡茲世所能致者幾於無不備焉，為之喜而不寐。夫為昔人著作謀盡其用，為後來學術廣闢其門，使材料不集中之苦痛從而解除，此眞無量之功德，所當為史林永頌者已。</p>
<p>補編所採，原共一百七十餘種；其後邀的同好，四出訪求，竟得超過二百四十種。堅毅之忱，使人欽服。此一百餘種中，舊有刻本者凡一百八十餘種，稿本僅存者得六十餘種，萬斯同。汪士鐸諸家沈霾已久之書賴斯而顯現，洵可謂為近年史學界中一絕大快舉。夫使我輩眼福可誇耀於前人者，開明書店之力也！</p>
<p>此書之出，非書肆中有此一舉為巳足也，必將有以答對今昔諸賢為學術工作之苦心，而後可以無愧。其道伊何？不揣　陋，的而陳之。昔之補表者多為職官，補志者多為地理。藝文。作者就材料之便，著此先鞭，分所應爾。然我輩生於今日，旣有新問題，斯有新需要，於民族。社會。宗敎諸端，俱當加意搜補，一也。有宋以還，治史者多禪心史，漢，表志補正之作遂以史。漢為最富。此自僩人工作言之，固為美滿之成就，而自史界全體觀之，則頗違於詳近略遠之旨。此後要常留心近古諸史，母使數十年後，書肆賡續編輯，仍有材料不平均之憾，二也。夫史料愈近愈豐，其於人事之關係亦愈近愈切，補編雖大抵以二十五史為範圍，而我輩工作實不當以此自限。淸史稿聞將解禁，其志如藝文。邦交。食貨之屬，在在皆可補訂。以今日去淸之近，直接史料保存之多，采銅於山，固不容異世之學者强而任之耳。</p>
<p>或曰：洵為采銅之說則前人之業非矣，彼輩無新材料而惟於舊史之中抽取記錄者也。此增補之書雖累百千萬言，其材料曾不能越出舊史之外，夫安貴有此重牀疊屋之舉為？答之曰：言不可以若是其幾！所貴乎學者，為其能盡物之用也。司馬遷作八書十表，其見於紀傳之材料十五六，彼果何為而為此？亦曰藉表志之嚴整以濟紀傅之散亂，以盡史書之用而已。前不云乎，表志者紀傳之綱領，夫作綱領者豈必待新材料哉，愼擇之斯可矣。今人孰不知二十五史為中國歷史事實之所薈萃，然能用之者有幾人；立一論題，查不知其材料所在，雖有其物，不能見也，是無綱領之害也。如是，則有史如無史。誠能整理舊村料，使物無遁形而人恣其用，為益之大必不在發見新材料下。何况淸人博雅之風自經被史，類能以新材料証故籍，故補百官表者有印章與封泥焉，補世系表者有碑辭與墓誌焉，何得云不越舊有史書！地不愛賣，古物日出，我輩生於今日，惟有隨時增補之，使無一物失其所。前人之業，可修正而不可非也。</p>
<p>「中國通史」之呼聲，聞之彌久，而其書至今不出，是非今日史家之咎，乃其憑籍之不厚有以致之。為是業者若不於史實有深識遠觀，於材料作廣搜博辨，則其書之成曾無以異於學校敎科。我輩倘有志於是，必將對於二十五史與此補編思所以盡量使用之術，且汰之存之，使無一字之虛濫，而於向日被屛於歷史範圍以外之材料及地下新發得之材料則以新方法比决之，新眼光判斷之，俾與舊有史書之汰存者融而為一。分途並進，鍥而不舍，數十年後必可為中國史學放一異彩，通史之出現乃有期也。值此補編發行之日，喜基礎之已奠，敢操券而待之！</p>

<h3>「楊柳風」</h3>
<p>— 周作人</p>
<p>每接讀手書，就想到楊柳風譯本的序，覺到這不能再拖延了，應該趕緊寫纔是。可是每想到後却又隨即擱下，為什麽呢？第一，我寫小序總想等到最後截止的那一天再看，而此書出版的消息查然，似乎還不妨暫且偸懶幾天。第一，——實在是寫不出，想了一回只好擱筆。但是前日承令夫人光臨面催，又得來信說書快印成了，這回覺得眞是非寫不可了。然而怎麽寫呢？</p>
<p>五年前在駱駝草上我曾寫過一篇介紹楊柳風的小文，後來收在看雲集裏。我所想說的話差不多寫在那裏了，就是現在也還沒有什麽新的意思要說。我將所藏的西巴特（Shepard）挿畫本楊柳風，兄所借給我的查麥士（Chalmers）著格來亨傅，都拿了出來翻閱一陣，可是不相干，材料雖有而我想寫的意思却沒有莊子云：「日月出矣而爝火不息，其為光也不亦微乎。」楊柳風的全部譯本已經出來了，而且譯文又是那麽流麗，只持人家直接去享受，於此而有何言說，是猶在俱胝和尙說法後去豎指頭，其不被棒喝攆出去者蓋非是今年眞好運氣不可也。</p>
<p>這裏我只想說一句話，便是關於那土撥鼠的。據傳中說此書原名蘆中風，後來才改今名。於一九〇八年出版。第七章「黎明的門前之吹簫者」彷彿是其中心部分，不過如我前回說過這寫得很美，却也就太玄一點了，於我不大有緣分。他的別一個題目是「土撥鼠與他的夥伴」，這我便很喜歡。密倫（Milne）所編劇本名曰癩施堂的癩施先生，我疑心這是因為演戲的關係所以請出這們癩是蟆來做言人翁。若在全書裏最有趣味的恐怕倒要算土撥鼠先生。密倫序中有云：</p>
<p>「有時候我們該把他想作眞的土撥鼠，有時候是穿着人的衣服，有時候是同人一樣的大，有時候用兩隻脚走路，有時候是四隻脚。他是一恫土撥鼠，他不是一個土撥鼠。他是什麽？我不知道。而且，因為不是認眞的人，我並不介意。」這話說得很好，這不但可以見他對於土撥鼠的了解，也可以見他的愛好。我們可以同樣地愛好土撥鼠，可是了解稍不容易，而不了解池就難得愛好。我們固然可以像密倫那樣當他不是一個土撥鼠，然而我們必須先知道什麼是一個土撥鼠，然後纔能够當他不是。那麼什麽是土撥鼠呢？據原文曰Mole牛津簡明字典註云。</p>
<p>「小獸穿地而居，微黑的絨毛，很小的眼睛。」中國普通稱云鼴鼠，不過與那飲河滿腹的似叉不是一樣，本草綱目卷五十一下列舉各家之說云：</p>
<p>「弘景曰，此即　鼠也，又名隱鼠，形如鼠而大，無尾，黑色，尖鼻甚强，常穿地中行，討掘即得。</p>
<p>「藏器曰，隱鼠陰穿地中而行，見日月光則死，於深山林木下土中有之。</p>
<p>「宗　曰，　脚絕短，僅能行，尾長寸許，項尤短，最易取，或安竹弓射取飼鷹。</p>
<p>「時珍曰，田鼠偃行地中，能壅土成坌，故得諸名」寺島良安編和漢三才圖會卷三十五引本綱後云：</p>
<p>「案魅狀似鼠而肥，毛帶赤褐色，頸短似野猪，其鼻硬白，長五六分，而下觜短，眼無眶，耳無珥而聰，手掘土，用鼻撥行，復還舊路，時仰食蚯蚓，柱礎為之傾，樹根為之枯焉。聞人音則逃去，早朝窺撥土處，從後掘開，從前穿追，則窮迫出外，見日光即不敢動，竟死。」這所說最為群盡，土撥鼠這小鼠的情狀大抵可以明白了，如此我們對於「土撥鼠先生」也纔能發生與趣，歡迎他出　來。但是很不幸平常我們和他缺少親近，雖然韋門道氏著的百獸圖說第二十八項云，「尋常田鼠舉世皆有，」實際上大家少看見他，無論少年以至老年提起鼴鼠，鼢鼠，隱鼠，田鼠，或是土龍的雅號，，恐怕不免都有點茫然，總之沒有英國人聽到摩耳（Mole），或日本人聽到摩悟拉（mogura）時的那種感覺罷。英國少見螻蛄稱之曰molericket（土撥鼠蟋蟀）若中國似乎應該呼土撥鼠為螻蛄老鼠纔行，准照以熟習形容生疏之例。那好些名稱實在多只在書本上活動，土龍一名或是俗稱，我却不明瞭，其中田鼠曾經尊譯初稿采用，似最可取，但叉怕與眞的田鼠相混，在原書中也本有「田鼠」出現，所以只好用土撥鼠的名稱了。這個名詞大的是西人所定，查百獸闡說中有幾種的土撥鼠，却是別的鼠類，在什麽書中把他對譯「摩耳，」我記不淸了，到得愛羅先珂的桃色的雲出版，土撥鼠纔為世所知，而這却芷是對譯「摩悟拉」的，現在的譯語也就衍襲這條系統，他的好處是一個新名詞，還有點表現力，字面上也略能說出他的特性。然而當然也有缺點，這表示中國國語的——也即是人的缺少對於「自然」之親密的接觸，對於這樣有趣的尋常小動物竟這麼冷淡，沒有給他一個好名字，可以用到國語文章裏去，不能說是一件大大的不名譽。人家給小孩講土撥鼠的故事，「小耗子」（原書作者的小兒子的　名）高高興興地聽了去安安靜靜地睡，我們和那土撥鼠却是如此生疏，在聽故事之先還要來考究其名號脚色，如此則聽故事的樂趣究有幾何可得乎，此不佞所不能不念之惘然者也。</p>
<p>兄命我寫小序，而不佞大談共土撥鼠，此正是文不對題也。旣然不能做切題的文章，則不切題亦復佳。孔子論詩云可以興觀羣怨，求曰多識於草木烏獸之名，我不知道楊柳風可以興觀羣怨吾，即有之亦非我思存，若其草木烏獸則我甚喜歡者也。有人想引導兒童到楊柳中之風裏找敎訓，或者是正路也未可知，我總不贊一辭，但不佞之意却希望他們於軍訓會考之暇去稍與癩蝦蟆水老鼠一遊耳，故不靜詞費而略談土撥鼠，若然，吾此文雖不合義法，亦尙在自已的題目範圍內也。</p>

<h3>遺傳·環境·敎育　讀『善惡家族』</h3>
<p>— 薛鴻達　Dr．H．H．Goddard著　黃素封　林潔娘譯</p>
<p>開明書店出版定價六角</p>
<p>應用遺傅心理學研究的結果，以謀人種改良的優生學，在中國還沒有引起學術界熱烈的注意。幾年前，潘光旦周建人兩先生會有過一番優生問題的討論，我們在人文生物學論叢（新月書店版）裏，就得讀到潘周兩先生的意見；可是以後就沒有看到這類非常有意義的討論，卽使有，祇是在敎科書上所能看到的幾句應有的「優生學概說」罷了。但是我覺得優生問題，確是值得我們研究，因為種族果如優生學的目的得能達到，社會上一切的黑幕，卑劣，汚糟的事，自然地會消滅，人民生活的平安，快樂，當可獲得。　而言之，民族復興哩，文化猛進哩，世界大同哩，又何嘗不會因世界上沒有低能和不良的份子，漸漸可以期望實現呢？</p>
<p>我好久沒讀到關於優生方面的書籍，最近讀到了黃紫封先生，林潔娘女士合譯的善惡家族，覺得很值得介紹給現代靑年讀一下，允其是願意負改進社會之重任的靑年。</p>
<p>這木書不是一味地講着科學理論，却是用輕鬆有趣的筆墨，記着郭達德博士一件對學術界很有貢獻的調查工作。郭氏在担任美國維英蘭城遲鈍和低能兒童敎養院附設的低能兒童實騐室主任時，收留了一個私生女孩戴笨娃，經過十四年的嚴格訓練，這位愚笨，低能，已二十多歲的女人，始終沒有方法使她能得到校普通十歲的小孩懂得多一些的智慧。郭氏為探求女孩的低能究竟是否由於祖先的遺傳起見，便着手調查她的家庭的情形，她的祖父的為人，結果得到一個出乎人人意外的報吿。這女孩的外祖父馬廷，是參加美國獨立戰爭的一個世家子弟，在行伍中，脅糊糊塗塗地和一個無名無姓的笨痴女郞通了婚，養了一個兒子叫小馬廷。後來小馬廷的子孫繁殖得很多，據郭氏調查，共四百八十人，可是這些人之中，有百分之九十以上不是白痴，酒鬼，便是犯罪的，賣淫的，壽命很短的，戴笨娃就是小馬廷的嫡裔。巧得很，和這個壞到透頂的家系做比照的，另有一個優良的家系，也是馬廷的子孫。原來馬廷於戰爭平靜退伍後，回家娶了一個健全的女子，他們後來的四百九十六個子孫中，大都是品學兼優的醫生，法官，律師，敎員，地主。馬廷和健全的女子所生育的子女們，便得個個健全，他和低能的女子所生育的子女，便是一羣猪狗不如的社會敗類，從這「美惡家族」的關係裏，我們可以得到下面所述的啟示。</p>
<p>一，遺傳的可能性，决不因環境之偶然變化而有所更動，其可更動者，僅發展的程度。（本書173頁）</p>
<p>二，改良環境和敎育，僅可增進已成之人，使其遺傳性質充分發展。而改良血種，則可以發達將來的種族。（173頁）</p>
<p>這樣看來，我們要使種族優良，一定要杜絕低能者的生殖，以免把他的劣性傳到後世的子孫，使種族，社會都得不到好處。這就是優生學者的主張。可是因為「人道主義」，「社會的風俗習慣」，及「低能者的程度測騐尙不能精密」等等關係，使「優生主義」的實行，卽如在英美等國，也行不開去，還仍須等待人類更進的努力。積極上旣難辦到阻止社會上全部低能者的生育，從消亟方面講，靑年們就應該謹愼地選擇他或她的配偶林女士說得好La：——</p>
<p>「聰明的結婚，不是男子娶妻要美麗的，女子擇夫要有錢的，我是說男子娶妻時，要注意她的性情是吾高尙純潔，能力是否一獨立雄厚，身體是否健壯結實，其次再看彼此思想上能否融洽，然後再訪問她的父母兩系的祖宗，是吾淸白健一全而無疾病。女子選擇丈夫，也要如此，不要做盲目的女子……」。</p>
<p>靑年男女在找終身伴侶時，假使能注意到這一層，那末對於自己本身，不，自已未來的子孫，有無窮好處了。此外本書112頁，有一段話，更說得非常痛快，可以作現代一部分靑年的座右銘。</p>
<p>「…身家淸白的少年朋友們，一失足便成千古恨，再回頭已是百年身。生殖器這樣東西，善用牠就能得好果，亂用牠就要得惡果。牠的功是不能補她的過。靑年的靑白朋友們，你千萬不要冒一時的衝動就去嫖呀，去勾引下等的婦女呀！女朋友們，請你們也不要只貪圖低能兒的榮華富貴，冠然以潔白之身，讓他們來作踐糟塌啊！」</p>
<h3>豐子愷先生　印象記和著譯目錄</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>士佼</p>
<p>棕黃色的臉上，嵌着謙和，誠懇，嚴肅的眼睛，留着一叢不常修飾的鬍鬚；暗色的長袍，呢帽；說起話來非常爽直，溫和：這樣的一位半老人，常常在我的回憶中出現。這就是八年前的我的老師，豐子愷先生。</p>
<p>說起他老先生，大概誰都會想到他的漫畫。那些疏疏落落的缐條所組成的畫而，往往會把你的精神吸引住，這就是他的藝術手腕。他的漫畫多半起革在一本自已創製的「速寫簿」上，那是一本構造很簡單的小冊子；本身只是一疊白報紙，外加一張軟布封面，再用一條帶子束着。他常常將它藏在衣袋裏，隨着內心浮起的感興，外界投入的印象，把它取出來應用。</p>
<p>他的漫畫作風，從幽趣如夢，詩意蔥鬱的境地中，改變到充滿着荊棘的現實相，是有着顯明的痕跡的。常第一本子愷漫畫出世時，那種題材和筆調，像春天的新柳一般嬌柔可愛，，給閱者一種比美夢更要舒適輕鬆的感覺。當時對於這個集子的批評，除大部分的讚美者外，自然也有一些人不以為然，說他是躱在他的象牙之塔裏，做他自己的美夢。到了第二木子愷畫集出版，顯然的巳稍稍帶着一些現實生活的描寫。其中許多關於兒童生活的漫畫，暗暗地表現出天眞的思想與現實的矛盾，特別的得到好評。這也許就是他後來續出兒童漫畫和兒童生活漫畫的動機。到了護生畫集和學生漫畫出版，他那柔和的詩一般的筆調，突然換上了譏諷腐敗的情形，都很深刻。這種作風的轉變，曾經引起文壇上詐多的批評和鼓勵，使他傾向實際方面轉變的態度更形堅決。從最近的一本人間相出版，我們就可以看出這個結果來。</p>
<p>在人間相中，他的畫筆已深深地挿入社會的深處。他攪出了各種人間的罪惡，刺入了矛盾的中心。大膽地揭穿人問一切不平等的行動。他的題村和表現的方法，可說是剛柔並至，直令人哭笑不得。</p>
<p>除了漫畫之外，豐先生的小品文也是很受讀者的歡迎。他常用細微的題材，引導出許多嚴重的問題；一顆沙粒中看出世界，便是他的作品的評語。文字是異常淸鬆，生動，一點沒有生澀，艱深和過於含蓄，令人難解的毛病。他喜歡用看繪畫的眼光看世上的一切；所以有時一個乞丐食變成美人；養在花瓶中的花朶會幻成哭臉。這些形相也常被奇妙地描寫着。他是一位很涵養的藝術家，所以他的文字中不但具有觀察細膩的形相，且常是寫得有聲有色。</p>
<p>截至現在。他所著譯的書已很可歡。現在把已經出版的，寫在下面：</p>

<p>一九三六年一月二十一日午后三點十二分，日本現任岡田內閣以「詔書」的無上權力，解散了日本議會。解散的理由是：政府處於現在的重大時局下，只有依賴「舉國一致」的協力，才能實現政府聲明過的政綱。但「觀察最近的政情，衆議院是不能圓滑地推行國政的。政府要實行嚴肅公正的選舉，期在明朗的政權下，實現政府的威信」，因此奏請解散議會。</p>
<p>目前正是無奇不出的競選時期。總選定於本年二月二十日。</p>
<p>解散議會原是值不得大驚小怪的。反對黨佔議會多數，而此反對黨準備對現內閣提出不信任案時，內閣如有解散議會的權力？當然就會運用牠。反對現任岡田內閣的政友會，佔現議會多數，而政友會要提出的不信任案早已準備，在這種塲合，衆議院當然免不了遭受解散。</p>
<p>政友會所提出的不信任理由很不少。總之，結論不外是說「現政府沒有擔當重大時局的能力」吧了。</p>
<p>解散經過已沒有詳述的必要。競選的內容則是應特加注意的。我們所注意的問題是：左右議會的動力是些共麼呢？競選的結果如何呢？新議會產生後，對於日本國內政治能發生多大的變動，對於國際關係能引起甚麽改革？</p>
<p>東京通信</p>
<h3>競爭白熱化的　日本『選舉肅正』</h3>
<p>——作為「非常時」中戰爭準備的過渡——</p>
<p>一九三六年一月二十一日午后三點（二）</p>
<p>第一，最值得注意的是，勿論現政府及現政府與黨以至反對黨，沒有不大聲疾呼：「時局重大。」這也就是日本軍部天天喊着的「非常時」。而且，最先喊出「非常時」的是軍部。軍部早認為政黨政治無力，排擊政黨政治，宣吿政黨政治已不能善處「非常時」。當然，能產生完全聽軍部指揮的政黨則更好。</p>
<p>日本自脫退國聯以來，最近又脫退了軍縮會議，日本在其勢力發展的現階段上，不但具有防止蘇聯赤化東亞的相當力量，而且已取着獨占東亞利益的進攻姿勢。這時期，不但要準備和蘇聯及蘇聯所領導的勢力作戰，而且在和各列强利益矛盾不能調恊時，也不得不準備充備的血彈去迫擊。</p>
<p>積極準備戰爭，就得積極增加軍費。一九三六年度的日本預算，軍事費佔總額的百分之四十六。總額將近二十三億。但，軍部還是以為太不够。若使軍費再增加，就不得不增發公債，以至增稅。高橋財政是標榜「公債漸减」，同時認為「增稅時機未至」的。不久以前，高橋考翁述日辛苦，通宵爭辯，方才使他造的十一年度預算成立。此次海陸軍「新規」所增加額雖已有二億千六百八十萬餘元，但尙未為軍部所滿足。</p>
<p>這樣大的數目的增加，在「非常時」的軍部看來還是太少了。允其，最近的軍縮决裂，顯然是會促進造艦競爭的：便是高橋也已表示軍艦整理費有增加的必耍了。</p>
<p>積極擁護及支持軍部要求的當然是一般軍需工業資產家。目前的所謂『景氣回復』，在殖民地擴大，獨佔的進展中，軍需工業的猛進實是『回復』的主因之一。在戰爭準備過程中，軍需工業能得高度發展是無疑義的。最近，「住友」對於航空機的製造便很活躍。軍部的性質是半封建的，然而軍部要是不能得到金融資產家的支持也就無從活躍。</p>
<p>日本資本中義的根本特徵之一是：「用幾分軍事的獨占去補充現代最新的金融資本之獨占；同時也有幾分代理金融資本作用的性質」。推進日本法西斯的根本原因，也就在此，日本對外强硬政策樹立的原因也不外這個。</p>
<p>由軍部高呌出的「非常時」，喚起現內閣所謂的「重大時局」「舉國一致」。而其他政黨各派也就不能不認為「時局重大」的？</p>
<p>在此重大時局下，日本看準了…國聯是一個無力的列强會議所——日德脫退了國聯，國聯無可奈何。今日的意阿戰爭，事實上是意大利和英國的衝突，然而由英國所頒導的國聯，也未能對意有怎樣的實力裁制。美國海軍固然强大，但要遠征日本，則力量未必充分。並且各列强的國內政爭正在擴大，經濟恐慌也並未脫出，再加以殖民地民族革命的紛起，（如埃及的最近的獨立運動高漲）——在此等事實下，只要日本給各列强以某種妥協，如廣田外相所說的，「要各列强承認日本為保持東亞安定之中心勢力」，這是很有希望實現的。至於蘇聯，牠正在埋首努力於第二次五年計畫，並且牠又須時時防備德國的進攻；自從中東路讓渡給日本後，顯然已表示了一步退却。最近的遠東增兵也不過是自身的東方防備而已。</p>
<p>在此「非常時」中，所謂「殖民地不足」的三個國家，意大利已進行東阿遠征，德意志已發起殖民地返還運動，日本的任務當然是不言可喩的了。</p>
<p>但是，日本現有的較大的政黨，在軍部看來，都不能擔當這「非常時」「重大時局」的任務。</p>
<p>但完全足以代表軍部，或完全聽軍部指揮的大政黨目前尙未形成。軍部允許現內閣存在，不過因為今日內閣原是官僚內閣，能受他五六分以上的支配吧了。將近成立的新議會及內閣，不相當地受制於軍部，當然不可能；但完全受制的新議會也未必能在此時產生。不過，目前的較大的政黨如政友會，民政黨，大半原是代表金融資本家的。目前正是金融資本及半封建的混合統治，所以，在這裏大半只是統治層的內部矛盾間題。在此內部矛盾發展中，只要一發現或甚至一互相意識到那下層大衆的力量高漲時，這問題也就必然會被調和，被統制起來。例如用「非常時」這種力量，卽可將他們統制起來。</p>
<p>而且，這統制將是全國强化的，軍事，政治，經濟的統制。因為「非常時」或「重大時局」就是戰爭準備的別名。</p>

<p>四十三比三十表演出出神入化</p>
<p>海賊遭逢多年所未遇之慘敗</p>
<p>今晚七時兩隊再戰於申園</p>
<p>參加亞林比克之中華籃球隊理想中之五隊員、</p>
<p>昨晚與海賊作第一次試賽、結果以四十三與三十之比大勝、使海賊遭遇數年來未有之慘敗、理想隊初决合作、表演已甚美妙、下半時起、海賊竟陷入走頭無路之紛亂狀態中、申園昨晚之觀衆、的計二千餘人、今晚七時、兩隊將再作第二决之試賽、觀衆之擁擠、在預料之中、惟協進會已决定祇發售門券一千五百張、以資維持場內秩序、每券一元、捷足者可先得、裁判員瞿鴻仁章文元、</p>
<p>中華五虎珠聯壁合</p>
<p>中華五虎昨晚之表演、確有值得稱賞之處、左右兩録王鴻斌牟作雲二人、敏速無比、出入籃內、使　賊顧此失彼、王鴻斌允勝於牟、中鋒王玉增不慌不忙、指揮裕如、更爲難得、王南珍亦珠聯璧合、李紹唐稍爲差耳、此隊若能加以長時訓練、在柑林或不至如何失望也、海賊之長人、昨晚全失效力、下半時戰將屢易、終不能挽在瀾於旣倒也、</p>
<p>玉增一托先開紀録</p>
<p>中華先以理想中之五隊員登場、王鴻斌牟作　王玉增王南珍李紹唐、三四盤旋、王玉增在籃下一托、先開紀錄、王鴻斌繼之成四比零、一時歡聲震屋、然一轉身萊恩憑共高下、在籃下還中、史規亞造成平手、卡爾生之遠射、海賊以六比四超出、</p>
<p>得意忘海賊猖獗</p>
<p>牟作雲罰卡爾生、一罰二中、得以迭成平手、在此後之五分鐘內、一隊鏖戰甚烈、中華令作、尙未十分順手、稍有慌張之態、海賊竟乘勢猛撲、史密斯連中二隻、史規亞萊恩亦互增得分、海賊遂以十三比六分佔優勢、此爲海賊最得意之時代、</p>
<p>初露鋒芒躍居先</p>
<p>中華叫息之後、重行對付、果然雲去天開、漸漸得手、開始露其鋒铓、李紹唐自後襲進、兩王各得其一、王南珍遠射中的、中華遂以十四比十三超出、一時軍威大震十七比十三白那特進替萊恩、海賊仍無補時艱、中華則愈戰愈形得手、上半時之結果、爲二十七比十八、中華估先九分、</p>
<p>生龍活虎海賊潰退</p>
<p>下半時重行接觸、萊恩再入、中華五虎、更見活躍、眞同生龍活虎、萊恩之來、絲毫不能阻止中華之前進、王玉增一中再中、比數成三十四比二十一、拉根及白那特入替史密斯別塞爾、海賊已陷入顧此失彼之狀態、四十一比二十五、馮念華人替王鴻斌、馮亦加上二分、及劉雲章、入戰局轉瞬終畢、比數爲四十三比三十、</p>
<h3>埠際足球賽　上海中華隊戰勝華北</h3>
<p>4－0上半時北軍順風而戰其勢較優下半時形勢縣殊北軍勉力抵抗</p>
<p>昨日下午三時、華北隊對代表華東之上海中華隊舉行埠際足球賽於申園、觀衆的三四千人、世運會足球還拔委員、亦蒞場觀察、以備參考、華北隊昨賽表演、似不及對高麗延禧隊時之精彩、前鋒專收中路、兩冀太少機會、不能活躍、故委璐雖佳、奈無用武之地、中衛譚福禎、及後衛張學堯李淸玉、表演頗不差、抵禦險球不少、上半時順風而戰、故其勢較優、惜良機屢失、未得奏效、下半時盡屬上海中華隊大下、華北腹地、蹂躪殆遍、只有招架之功、無還手之力、上海中華隊五鋒聯絡頗順利、陳鎮和孫錦順允賣力、曹秋亭於下半時登場、機會雖少、表演極佳、幾個强硬脚頭、値得觀衆贊許、中後衛亦能克盡厥職、故能以四比零獲勝、</p>
<h3>中華猛攻兩度失機</h3>
<p>三時正、裁判員何春輝鳴笛、華北隊開球、上海隊逆風而戰、孫鐘順截得來球、傳與顧尙勷、再傳許竟成、沿邊盤進、舉足命射、陳鎮和在鬥前頭頂未着、張學堯踢成角球、許竟成主踢、被李淸玉救出、的十五分鐘時、許竟成再踢角球、孫錦順揮起鐵腿猛射，楊春英不敢怠慢、雙手一推、球出門外、兩度危機、幸獲波過、</p>
<h3>永泉猛射越門而過</h3>
<p>譚福楨輸送糧草、孫永泉單騎深入、上海隊後防空虛、江善敬活似猛張飛、連忙趕上、踢出界外、華北隊再接再厲、孫福來率領三軍、如排山倒海、直逼上海陣地、閻承寬希圖之功、拚命一射、李寗失足、顧尙勷繼之均未擋住、孫永泉候個正着、惜用力過猛、越門而過、險極、</p>
<h3>小許高球首開紀録</h3>
<p>上海隊大難旣過、奮力反攻、二十四分鐘時、陳鎭和高球傳與許文奎、許在十數碼外反身一脚高球、姿勢極爲美觀、楊春英未及防備、球從右角射入、首開紀錄、華北隊雪恥心切、力圖報復、上海隊貪心不足、欲再得功、雙方均極賣力、此來彼往、結果均無所得、上半時完結、上海隊以一比零佔先、</p>
<h3>老孫鐵腿一舉成功</h3>
<p>檸檬後、上海隊開球、未三分鐘、曹秋亭大顯身手、帶球深入、李清玉上前陰擋、曹急遠射傳與賈幼良、賈連忙傳中、孫錦順勢如餓虎、鐵腿一舉、球應聲入網、上海隊又得一城、華北隊氣憤塡膺、誓復失地、大軍又壓上海隊陣地、孫福來閻承寬如狼似虎、孫永泉隨後接應、離門的十數碼、孫恃其脚頭準確、舉足命射、張榮才懷抱阿斗、拋出數丈以外、李鳳樓火上加油、球低而急、張樂才不敢戀戰、一脚踢出、孫永泉趕上、兩人滾做一團、</p>
<h3>老孫黑炭相繼立功</h3>
<p>陳鎭祥得球又向前方運送、曹秋亭、再施故技、孫錦順在二十四碼左右、鐵腿一揮、楊春英眼花撩亂、球鑚入網、上海隊勢燄萬丈、曹秋亭一度受傷出場、陳鎭祥越界築路、鵲巢鳩占、在左角射至中點、許文奎踢在楊春英手上、未能命中、曹秋亭負傷應戰、陳鎭和久伏思動、得錦順傳遞、在門前輕輕一撥、滾入網內、造成四比零之局、</p>
<p>北軍勢弱勉力抵抗</p>
<p>此後華北隊士氣愈襄、勉强抵抗、孫錦順許文奎陳鎭和先後進攻、均無功而返、曹秋亭乘隙偷營、球彈門柱、越位作廢、旋李淸玉犯規、許文奎在中衛綫主踢、勁而有力、幸爲楊春英接住、化險爲夷、時間己屆、鳴金收軍、雙方陣綫如下、</p>

<p>敎痛新聞</p>
<h3>淸末以來我國小敎科書概觀</h3>
<p>這似乎是一個無關宏旨的問題、但是很粗的邊錢、允長的書名用四號字排印的頁目、還有所謂一生字」闌等、五花八門、雜印在課本裏實在也太不雅觀了、自然以取消爲是、現在雖然還有幾家很保守、沒有把這些無聊的東西取消、但是有好多家出版的書、却已取消了、連敎科書的夾縫裏也注意到這不能說不是敎科害的進步的表顯、總而言之、我國的小學敎科書、大體上確實時時刻刻在改良進步之中、據從歐美考察敎育回國的某君說、「我國小學敎科書較之歐洲各國、殊無遜色」、這雖然是大體的估量、仔細地分析起來、未必盡然、可是幾十年來、我國小學敎科書、確實有驚人的進步、這是稍注意敎科書的人都知道的、</p>
<p>不過我國小學敎科書、跟歐美各國最進步的敎科書仔細地比較、還有許多「望塵莫及」的地方、例如、</p>
<p>歐美最進步的小學國語敎科書、生字復習决數很多、我國的國語敎科書生字、復習决數較少、這是山於我國的文字形體複雜取用爲難的綠故、在我國文字沒有改用「新文字」以前、實在是無從和歐美最進步的小學敎科書比較的、</p>
<p>歐美小學敎科書的敎材分量多、挿圖彩色圖也多而精美、我國小學敎科書的敎村分量少、挿圖也比較地少而草率、在歐美各國經濟情形比我國好、敎科書的定價不妨高昂（美幽一本小敎科書、有定價高到美金一元以上的）所以敎材分量也不妨增加挿圖彩色圖也不妨加多、我國經濟情形太壞、敎科書的定價不能過高（我國一本小學敎科書定價大概只法幣一角、實價抵不到一本美國敎科書定價的三四十分之一）、所以敎材分量也不能過於增加、挿圖也只得少些、彩色圖更不能增加、至于挿圖的精美與吾是於技術很有關係的、自然我們的技術比較差些、無庸諱言、</p>
<p>歐美的小學敎科書、印刷精良、裝訂堅固、我國的小學敎科書、印刷裝訂都比較草率得多、這是跟經濟以及技術都有關係的、技術還可改進、經濟很少辦法、</p>
<p>歐美的小學敎科書、各科都能平均發展、我國的小學敎科書、另有國語科用書進步得最多、其餘各科用書進步很少各國的社會習慣、各科並重、我國的社會習慣、只重視國文國語、所以各書坊也往往只把國文國語改進、做自已的門面、其餘各科用書、就不急急地改進了、</p>
<p>此外、我國的小學敎科書、現在還有一個奇怪的現象、就是差不多各科都有敎科書、不但國語算術、常識（或社會自然）有敎科書、連衛生·美術·勞作也有敎科書、因此見童讀的書、種類很多、小學敎員的敎學方法又不很好、只是死讀記憶、逼得兒童一天到晚讀書背書、忙不過來、造成了許多麻木或神經衰弱的小國民、照我的意思、小學低年級只消國語用敎科書、算術不必用敎科書、只用練習簿、常識也不必用敎科書、只用工作簿、其餘各科、重在「卽學卽做」、更用不到敎科書、中年級國語常識兩科用敎科書、其餘跟低年級一樣、只用工作簿或參考書、高年級只有國語。社會。自然。衛生用敎科書、其餘都用參考書或工作簿等、最理想的辦法、其實中高年級、都可以只有國語「科用敎科書、常識或社會自然等也都用參考書、各小學喜歡多用敎科書、大概因為看見各書店多出版各種敎科書的緣故、各書店喜歡多出各種敎科書、大槪因為營業的關係、所謂「有生意總得做」的綠故、因爲營業、多出敎科書因爲多出版敎科書、學校就多用敎科書、道實在不是一個好辦法、我希望將來各書店多編各科參考書工作簿、以供各小學採用、最後我還有兩層意思、</p>
<p>小學敎科書、固不免有粗製造濫的、但是有些人帶著顏色眼鏡或者存著破壞的心思、批評小學敎科書、說她這樣不好、那樣不對、甚至把最進步的敎科書、也批評得「體無完膚」、這也不是一個好現象、我以爲小學敎科書、批評易而編輯難與共空空地批評別人的作品、倒不如自己拿些貨色出來給別人看看、至少也要用建設的態度眞正客觀的科學方法把如何改進的意見向編輯者誠懇陳說、沒有一點「歪曲」、沒有一點別的作用、以使別人心服、</p>
<p>我國小學敎科書、還沒有十分進步、比較進步的敎育書、也不見得被小學敎科界爭先採用、所以某商人說、「小學敎科書無所謂好壞、講銷路只在乎營業手段、即使編了好的小學敎科書、小學敎員們也未必識貨、也未必會用」、這些話、固然駡得太兇、但是小學敎員不會選擇敎科書、或</p>

<h3>證券　公債取銷劃帳　一月期交割達五千餘萬</h3>
<p>昨一月三十日及三十一日為貨商證券交易所一月份期貨交割之期、因近來投機之風過熾、當局因欲澈査關係不准仍照向例各經紀人互相自行劃帳交割、故交易所交割事務、愈見繁忙、計共為五千二百四十五萬元、內統鹽稅兩種計有一千二三百萬為最多、此次交割、因適逢投機狂熱、市價大起波濤、部令査究、幷令空方不論新舊、成交一律現品提交、同時幷令中·中·交三行庫存債券、一槪封存、不准挪動、致交劃幾發生困難、後經解决以貨易貨、交割始兌辦理淸楚、至言一月份期經過情形、先則狂漲、扶搖直上、繼則劇跌、愈趨愈下、自去歲十一月二十九日開始上場起、即因多頭公司竭力拉提、市上即有政府收回之謠、十二月十四日裁兵高至八十二元五角五分、十二月二十九日正六高至七十九元二角、鹽稅漲至五十七元一角、此猶統一幣制之餘威、殷汝耕之獨立、華北自治等、均已不發生效力、後以金幫大數放空、减息謠言、忽隱忽顯、於是做空者日見增加、减息延期謠言亦愈傳愈廣、市價乃逐日下降、至一月二十八日、為一月份期貨最後一日、裁兵跌至六十八元六角半、正六跌至六十七元、鹽稅跌至四十九元二角、高低相差、裁兵為十三元九角、正六為十二元二角、鹽稅為七元九角、雖屬减息謠言之影響、究為投機家過分狂熱、致有部令現品提交之舉、自此投機者當不逐自退、市面當可平定、惟交易亦必隨之銳减、茲將一月份期貨交割及總成交數、分別列表於後、（單位百元）</p>

<h3>紐約絲價又跌　滬埠絲經尚難成交</h3>

<h3>紗花　現銷奄無生氣　紗市上漲無力</h3>
<p>紗市晨平午回、但趨勢尚屬徘徊之象、以各方存紗增厚、客幫現紗銷路仍無生色、因之多數心理傾向拋賣、惟一般樂觀者議論、紗春銷時期尚早、須待廢暦元宵燈節以後、實需當然有希望發展、所以盤旋力極大也、</p>
<p>標紗交易寥落</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、以外棉轉漲、且上日有大戶拉進、市勢較緊、但新買者未見十分踴躍、各月均漲四·五·六角、二盤以後、聞現紗生意奄無生氣、各幫絕少動靜、且市場交易寥落、結果各月比上日收盤價微跌一角、午後開盤、有一部分獲利空頭活動扒補、致檯風轉緊、市態略趨高翔、結果各月比上午收盤價漲二·三·四角、査賣出梅記三百五十包、裕大二千包、森康六百五十包、仁豐五百包、元一三百包、同和二百包、信誠五百五十包、買進大昌成四百五十包、大豐三百五十包、賡豐七百包、長豐七百五十包、潤康三百五十包、瑞大八百包、協成三百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>棉市徘徊不前</h3>
<p>棉市始跌繼平、印棉上日跌風過暴、今則復出二百羅比關外、然美棉趨勢平疲、益呈趦趄不前之狀、而標金市况平萎、賣方壓迫依然劇烈也、標花前市開盤、因印棉轉好、復出二百羅比關外、惟美棉狀態平寂、人心稍振、近月空頭活動抵補、市價趨挺、拍至遠月、又入疲途、二盤以後、檯面轉鬆、以標金疲莫能興、賣方活動壓迫而挫、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌一角半至二角半、午後開盤、聞印棉暗盤僅小二角半、達記續來扒空、瑞大購進、市價徐徐上升、結果各月比上午收盤價增漲五分至一角半、査賣出大孚一千九百担、森康二千担、恒德一千二百担、元一二千四百担、源兴昌　千四百担、長和四千三百担、潤康一千七百担、大昶一千二百担、買進大豐一千二百担、達記六千二百担、愼記一千一百担、瑞大二千六百担、長餘一千担、大昌成二千九百担、信誠一千三百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>印棉日商買進回漲</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市况呆滯、各月跌一至六磅音、同業靜候華盛頓方面會議之結果、一角二分借欵能否延長、農田法有何發展、然後再定營業方針、先因多頭了結、近月移至砍遠月而跌、後以同業買進而回、午後因股市有力、趨勢堅定、據約翰遜聲音、囤棉處未售三月期棉、目下仍存一七八、六〇〇包、收盤平波、計現貨不動、期貨漲二磅音至跌八磅音、英棉現貨漲三點、期貨漲四點、印棉初因日商買進而漲、後因上印度多頭了結及套賣而疲、計平果爾漲一·五至一·七五羅比、奧姆辣及白羅溪漲二羅比半、原電錄左、（三十日電）</p>

<p>査現紗在一二月間適値上海金融風潮澎湃、銀行錢莊相繼倒閉、銀根奇緊、各方需要固受影響、但華南一隅、對於本紗納胃日增、廣幫全年成交為七萬五千九百十八包、占總數百分之三十、較二十三年成交之六萬四千八百八十一包、則增一萬一千〇三十七包、滇幫採辦與上年相仿、惟湘蜀兩省因匪患平靖、人心安定、銷場大增、四川匯水軋平、商業活絡、紗銷起色、川幫全年成交三萬五千九百九十五包、較二十三年亦增一萬〇〇二包、長沙幫因當地對於外紗進省稅取銷、購辦暢健、全年成交為二萬二千〇十五包、比二十三年增八千七百二十五包、華比一帶、受外紗牽制、紗銷範圍日見狹隘、兼之時局糾紛不寗、津幫成交量一萬三千六百五十三包、較二十三年則激减一萬五千一百四十九包、河南幫亦减一萬〇八百九十六包、內地幫因上年江浙兩省年成荒歉、購買力愈弱、减一万九千四百八十七包、至現鈔市價、全年四十二支升降範圍在八十八元至六十三元、二十支紗五十三元半至二十八元、十六支紗三十四元七角半至二十八元、十支紗三十九元至二十六元間、又査一月份成交量一萬七千五百六十九包、二月份一萬九千〇七十一包、三月份以全年成交為最旺、大戶吳某等猛力購進、做多收貨、結果被外棉下瀉、銀根緊逼、廣東雲南四川三幫購進二萬包、天津河南內地買一萬五千、故成交四萬一千三百十二包、四月份成交二萬六千八百五十三包、五月份二萬五千〇〇四包、六月份二萬六千八百六十三包、七月份二萬九千〇六十四包、八月份二萬二千二百〇六包、九月份因通貨膨脹空氣、買者尤多、成交三萬一千二百九十四包、十月份成交二萬八千九百十九包、十一月份成交一萬五千四百五十八包、十二月份二萬〇三百三十八包、茲半三年間各幫買額列表如下、（單包）</p>
<h3>糧食　中關客秈續俏</h3>
<p>昨日客秈囤戶去胃已淡、客幫則復有應酬、市面續居挺俏、如今後客囤兩路再有旺辦、則市價或須再度上升也、良以目下來貨日祗一二千包、而去化則日有一二萬也、昨日統市開出一萬包左右、客戶則有廈門去粵米二百包、汕頭去漢　米一百七十七包、泉州去贛紅米一百二十包、天津幫初度試辦暹邏米彔九百包、客化數目雖微、然市形已見活潑、且本街鄕莊去胃更貪、全日開去江西米六千五百包、湘米六百五十五包、沙市三百四十包、溫台甬米一千五百多包、行情與前市相似、惟中次貨本客兩活、略形挺站云、</p>
<p>一月份麵粉交割一萬包</p>
<p>昨日粉市為一月份交割日、全日實際交割數量、並不豐厚、因廠方現粉甚缺、新貨當無交出、祗一部分之回籠貨尚有脫手、計錄兵船九千包、紅藍車一千包、事前曾有長江粉交割之說、但無實現、大約因手續繁瑣、不能如本埠廠家之便利云、</p>
<p>一月份雜糧交割槪况　芝蔴收解達二十九票之鉅</p>

<h3>從醫學上所看的女性的結婚適齡期</h3>
<p>— 郭柏霖</p>
<p>人類所持有的種種的生命現象之中，生殖繁殖並非人類出生時候就吿出現的東西，而是可能營巢性生活的特徵，出現於女性身體的上面，而是備了生殖能力的時節，始開始發生的生命現象。結婚旣以遺傳子孫為根本目的，那麽結婚適齡期便卽是最能自然地營巢繁殖的年齡了，可是無論是雙親或社會，都比較對此問題不加注意的樣子。</p>
<p>月經與排卵　生殖年齡，如人所盡知，係開始於月經。女性當出生的時候，便在兩方的卵巢擁有的五十萬的卵胞，此卵胞在十三四歲的時候被開始發育，子宮隨之發生變化，進行排卵，其結果是月經的來潮。因月經必定以排卵為條件，故月經卽是已能營巢生殖的證明，我國的平均初潮年齡是十四歲六個月乃至十五歲二個月，所以若達及此年齡，就可能總婚而無妨了。</p>
<p>結婚適齡期　但是在此時代因脂肪的沈着尙未完了，故無論如何皮膚之能有緊張，抱擁光輝和滑潤，而形成有均整美的姿態，身體也可吿完備無憾，都得在十七歲至十八歲之間，自此以後皮膚便逐漸吿弛緩而减光澤，皮下脂肪亦不自然地沉着起來。所以最適當的結婚年齡，是月經開始後稍為慢了一點的身體告完成的——卽雙親尙認為小孩子的十八歲至二十一歲之間。</p>
<p>晚婚與難產　齊爾海姆氏稱女性的結婚期是十八歲至二十歲，但史哲權敎授却稱十八歲至二十四歲。然則，為什麼其後的晚婚不好呢？卽是因性器的彈性，消失的緣故。子宮，膣，骨盤等，就是懷孕的時候，亦不能如年靑時那樣組織起變化，分娩後又不能充分恢復平常的狀態，故難產自然就變成多數了。根據齊爾海姆氏的發表，則子宮及膣的脫出，最多數是晚婚者，並且出生的數目也示着愈晚婚則愈减少的事實。在今日，雖然女子身體的發育與昔日並無差異，然而結婚期却逐年呈示着遲晚的傾向，這從醫學上來看，確是堪悲嘆的現象，該可能與職業婦人的問題同樣，需要深切考慮的事項吧！</p>
<h3>蘇聯的女工生活</h3>
<p>— 影天</p>
<p>在好多年以前的蘇聯，機器工廠裏絕少可以瞧見那些少女們的足跡；但是，現在可不了。孕育着埋頭苦幹的精神，身體是魁梧的，到處都能發現這一類的女工。伊們不但於經濟地位能舒齊的站住，更於工廠的政治地位，也和男子們是不相上下的。所以人們都說：「伊們和男子一般的有着勇進的毅力和比賽的精神，生產上也和男子們一樣有着同等的地位。」</p>
<p>從千艱萬難裏燃起了火把；終於給伊們實現了口號而完全「解放」了。在蘇聯政府實行保障童工及女工的政策之後，所以大小工廠更拚命地發展女工的數量，以及改善女工的生活；（從十二小時的工作時間而縮到六七小時。設備很多工廠學校，俱樂部，休養室，托兒所，圖書館，運動塲等。）在平時絕不敢無故開除女工。</p>
<p>這是伊們比較簡單的工作：大家都環繞着一張長而且狹的木桌子上，手裏拿着一把鐵鉗，將細小的銅綫裝配着一種機件。沒有一些倦態地工作着。而這種工作雖是輕便，每月的薪水却有一百盧布左右。在這不少的數目上看，別一個資本主義的國家裹的女工，伊們的服裝是奢侈得很了。可是在蘇聯却是儉樸得這樣：粗布的工人服裝，外面罩着件重笨的黑色大衣，算是禦寒了。</p>
<p>在這裏絕對沒有每月只得着幾個盧布的女工人。工業的塲所裏至少每月可得五十盧布的左右。女傭的工錢，也有十五盧布的一月代價。</p>
<p>伊們除了每天在工廠裏做六七小時的工作之外，其它大部份的時間便消磨在書本上。上學校，和圖書館；也有熱心的去參加婦女集團工作。星期六的下午，伊們得着休息的時候了；大家都一窩蜂地奔進俱樂部，隨着導師的音樂，唱着愉快的歌聲。晚上例有一决電影或遊藝會，及演講會等。俱樂部的意義是包含着「啟發工人的智慧」和「調劑女工的生活」。而外，更有每星期出版的一張壁報，在那裏時時可以發現伊們有價值的文章。</p>
<p>如果遇到了生育，伊們得享受十四和十六個星期的休養，工資照給，有的工廠甚至担任了一切的費用，休養期滿了，伊們就把嬰孩放入「托兒所」自己仍埋頭地工作去了，沒有復元的得續假若干日，仍可入「休養室」去調養。</p>
<p>終之，蘇聯的女工是前進的，而也是幸福的；不過，伊們幸福的得來，也是由於艱苦中奮鬥出來的。</p>
<h3>法國男女的法律上不平等</h3>
<p>— 張亦菴</p>
<p>自命為文明先進的法國人，對於未成年的人，瘋在人，妻，母的處置是完全以男性的意旨為依歸的，他們把這些人視作男性所有的產業。法國的法律大部分是傾重在丈夫方面的。妻不能自己處分伊的產業，不能自已處理伊的銀行帳目，對於敎養兒女也不能參加些微的决斷，在契據文件上也無權畫署。倘若伊發覺婚姻不滿意時亦不能違背丈夫的意旨而提出離婚。除了很罕見的特殊情形之外，如果丈夫即使有姦淫的行為而不是犯於自已家中時，其妻亦不能據為按吿的罪狀。</p>
<p>反之，倘若丈夫發覺他的妻子有不貞的行為，他可以向檢察官舉告，檢察官便不得不從事偵察。司法機關的偵探　於不貞妻子的偵查是無微不至的。在他們的法典裏第三三七條定明凡婦女犯有對於丈夫不貞之罪者處三個月以上二年以下的徒刑，而一個丈夫若在他『自已的家庭中』與妻子以外的女子犯姦則處叫元至八十元的罰金。丈夫如果當場捉着妻子犯姦時，可以將妻子殺死而不違法；反之，妻子若在丈夫犯姦時將其殺死則為謀殺犯。</p>
<p>法國的妻子向其丈夫提出離婚是最不智的，因為在離婚手續進行的時期，丈夫可以將其妻子的財產物業盡行變賣，使其離婚之後一無所有。</p>
<p>丈夫愛居住在那裏妻子只有順從。如果妻子提出別居的話，則丈夫可以合法地將伊毆打，可以把持着錢財衣食用物，靳而不與。如果伊不顧一切，定要離開，則檢察官會命警察將伊押送回來。丈夫可以拆閱妻子的函件或阻止伊收受。」</p>
<p>有一個妻子給一輛街車車傷了，伊的傷勢要截去一條腿，伊要按吿那汽車公司賠償傷害的損失，但是沒有伊丈夫的許可就不能進行控吿，而伊的丈夫却因為有外遇而別家地去了。後來伊的丈夫勉强許可了，勝訴了，公司照例要賠償一收錢。可是伊連一個蘇也沒有筆到，因為給他的丈夫領去而把持住了，這是合法的。</p>

<h3>廖何香凝指示婦女救國之路</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>男子要救國，女子們更要救國！</p>
<p>爭民族生存，求中國自由平等！</p>
<p>何香凝女士，大家知道她是革命先烈廖仲凱先生的夫人，數十年來，為革命奔走，為國難呼號；是婦女界的先覺者，是赤誠愛國的巾幗丈夫；凡站在救國戰綫上的人們，誰不表示欽仰。我認識她的時候，還在「一二八」淞滬抗戰之後，那時她曾開過一次國難畫展會，把旅居巴黎時所作之畫，盡數出售，得錢以供前綫救傷之用。當年主持傷兵醫院，救護隊，慰勞隊等，轟動一時。但四五年來，國難更深，夫人愛國愈切，氣體愈義，隱居辣斐德路某邨，杜門謝客，外間難得其寓址，我這决去訪問，幸得柳亞子先生代的，纔能如願以償。她住的是一所三層的洋房，陳設簡潔，室中靜寂無聲，廖夫人迎面說一聲「多年不見了！」「是的，差不多四年了。」於是我們在書房裏坐定，開始談話：</p>
<p>「廖夫人最近的生活怎樣？」</p>
<p>「我向來過中下層的生活，願永恒地維持下去，和平民一樣，可惜心臟病不時發作，一點不能勞動，所以外間交際應酬，一概謝絕，隨侍左右的，惟一女一甥而巳。我家收入無多，用途亦甚儉，繪畫是我素好，以此自遺，亦以此養生。去年曾鬻畫千餘元，衣食可以無憂，我不願受國家的俸祿，自問心地光明無疵。」</p>
<p>「夫人近來對國難的觀感如何？」</p>
<p>「那是痛心極了。我是救國有心，報國無方，依目前情勢，和平早已絕望，惟有竭全國人之心力，共赴國難，抵抗圖存。我中華堂堂天當之國，豈能長期屈服？…」她說到這裏，語氣非常激昂。</p>
<p>「夫人對婦女救國有何主張？」我便轉到婦女本身的問題上來。</p>
<p>「現實的中國，不管男女，都不能放棄救國的實任。上海新近組織的婦女救國會，我雖不擔任什麽名義，但表示非常同情。曾應該會之邀，演講多决，我歸納的幾句話：便是婦女救國的責任，比男子更為東要，一旦大戰爆發，男子效命沙場，女子一面隨軍救護，一面維持後方，倘使二萬萬男子都戰死了，還剩着二萬萬的女子；其中除老的少的以外，少壯的懷孕女子，可以生育，把這些小國民，敎養起來，至多二十年，依然可以復國的；所以有女子在，永遠不怕亡國的。」</p>
<p>「夫人對婦女參政的意見怎樣？」</p>
<p>「中山先生在日，召開第一决全國代表大會，便規定男女平等的法律，婦女參政，是當然的權利。不過現政府藐視女子，絕少任用，而女界也不起來爭取地位，所以女子現在政治上活動的，大都卑卑微職而已。」</p>
<p>「關於婦女職業方面，夫人有何高見？」</p>
<p>「現在國難期間，工商各業，全不景氣，男子尙且失業，何况女子？除非國民革命完全成功，帝國主義的經濟侵略完全停止之後，女子職業纔有出路。」</p>
<p>「夫人對於目前中國女靑年一的生活，有什麽批評？」</p>
<p>「在都市裏一般高貴女靑年，無論在衣食住行那方面，我覺得太奮侈，沒有勞動的精神，刻苦的耐性；而游樂場中的女子，可以說她「商女不知亡國恨！」至於農村及工廠裏的女子，實在太可憐，誰來解救呢？」</p>
<p>「現代婦女的動向，意見紛歧，有主張向外奮鬥的，有主張對內主持家政的；有主張內外兼顧的折衷論的；夫人主張婦女該向那一方面走？」</p>
<p>「我主張婦女應從事國民革命，爭民挨生存；求中國之自由平等；對外如此，對內亦然。」</p>
<p>廖夫人說話很誠懇，而且越說越有勁，我們談了一些婦女問題以外，其他也談得不少。我很想索她一張照片，留給讀者瞻仰，可是她從不照相的，只給我兩本畫集，選刋一幀，以誌紀念</p>

<h3>女車掌</h3>
<p>— 祝嘏</p>
<p>哈爾濱的女子職業之一</p>
<p>女子的職業，現已普遍全中國了，像東北的幾省裏的封建遺毒還到處瀰漫着，差不多的職業完全被男子所把持，倘使女子要想挿足到社會的職業中去，那眞是一件萬難的事。</p>
<p>現今哈爾濱的女子職業，要算是大汽車上的女車掌（就是售票員）了，因為起先哈爾濱的汽車，都是私人經營的，自一九三四年的三月裹拿大汽車收歸市營，後來市政當局為提倡女子職業起見，也就是為招徠乘客，特地的招考一輩女車掌，他們的條件只要年輕，最好年齡在十五歲至二十五歲，要有高小以上的程度，招考的人數是一百五十名，應考的竟達一千五百餘名，結果選取了一百名，然而伊們的程度十份之八是中學卒業的。</p>
<p>這個事件竟轟動了整個的哈爾濱，在女車掌開始工作的第一天，便有一輩男子爭先恐後的跑去看女車掌，並且顯露出驚奇的樣子，他們的眼光恨不得鑽進女車掌的面孔的膚層裏，還有許多男子專為看女車掌而來坐一段汽車的，所以那天車務管理處的收入，成了一個可驚的數目，隔了不久女車掌的職業被哈爾濱的社會人士，看為比女招待都不如，竟不客氣的去侮辱，但是，女車掌在那搖幌不定的汽車裏要工作十小時，在那時滿耳的是一些不堪入耳的汚語，往往女車掌的脚和身子常被故意的踐踏和擠撞，還有一輩乘客的眼光，永遠的射在女車掌的身上，好像女車掌的面孔，有引人注意的奇蹟，在賣票的時候，乘客不把錢輕輕的遞過去，非要塞到女車掌的手心裏，順便在手心裏搔一下，當女車掌把票給乘客，乘客一定不肯放鬆的把女車掌的手揑上一决，他們下車的時候，女車掌要去收票，伊的手又要被搔和揑了，他們嘴裏還要嚕哩嚕囌的說上一串話：「我們化了四分洋錢，可以搔揑三决手，還可看一個笑臉，眞正便宜……」照這樣的乘客要佔二份之一，在起初的幾天這侮辱女車掌事，伊們只得默默的忍受了，後來女車掌遇着這類的侮辱，便向乘客責問，有時把他們推下車廂，結果吵鬧起來，有時女車掌把乘客扭到車務總監那裹論理，反而給女車掌一個不平的裁判，乘客因為是顧主，車務總監當然不去責難，女車掌反大大的受了一頓申斥，終於記了過，有的竟被開除。</p>
<p>從此那輩乘客更加無忌憚了，然而那輩女車掌再也不敢哼一聲，因為失業的鬼臉時時刻刻的在嚇伊們，所以女車掌的侮辱，直到現在還沒有消滅。</p>
<h3>舊式的母教廢歷新年所見之一</h3>
<p>— （江敉）</p>
<h3>阿國婦女的特點</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>自從阿比西尼亞和意大利開戰以後，向不為人注意的阿國婦女，也成了報紙上的新聞資料，據基督敎科學月刊阿京特訪員函稱，阿國婦女界，很有新時代的風氣，在大衆前，很有禮貌，阿國京城雖不乏美貌男女，但男女間絕少調情誇炫的舉動，婦女志氣甚高，無論處何境况，不甘受奴隸的待遇。伊們是自由慣了的，婦女都露着臉，光着頭，赤着足，服裝樸素，不用彩色，和繡品，白色外衫，長幾及足，却露出足踝上戴的銀鐲，兩臂和頸脖，都用白色大圍巾遮著，市場上常見男女同行，伊們動苦耐勞，能和男子同甘苦，如伐木，耕種，織布，扛物等等，都和男子一起工作。伊們不輕離男子，有時男子前赴戰場，伊們也隨着同去，街道上常見騎騾的婦女，貴婦人上騾下騾，有僕人替伊拿着圍巾，阿國男女平等，但有數事，很可詫異：例如男子須自己洗衣服，這大的在古時候，婦女山山間小屋到河邊去洗衣時易被鄰近部落划去，所以由男子代勞，久而久之，成了風俗，男孑也無異議。阿京歐人所儸用的洗衣烹調和私室僕役，差不多都是男子，男子並須和女子同負照應兒女的責任，男子的一切財政事務，都須和女子商量，婦女自已僱有男女僕役，或購置奴隸，一切產業，都是男女共有，婦女並無私室，賓客到家，和丈夫共同招待，丈夫在室，見妻入室，須起立示敬，受過敎育的兒童，見父母入室，也常起立，白髮老人，很有權威。阿國的婦女，有管理田產和其他重要事業的，儀們並經營許多小商業，有開麵包店的，有開咖啡館的，婦女能向法庭起訴，能承繼遺產，能將債戶用練鎖住。阿國歷代皇后，很掌大權，現今的皇族，是起源於希巴皇后，伊是阿國歷史上最磊落的人物。當近代著名米尼里克皇執政時，皇后台圖，是他最重要的輔政人，伊曾參加對意戰事，據傳阿軍在阿杜華大勝意軍一役，是靠了伊的力量。後來米尼里克皇失勢，伊便掌理朝政，繼后登位的，是一位美少年雅蘇氏，他因信奉了回敎，並且有種種不負責的行為，為國中元老所不滿，所以在位不久，便被廢逐，選了一位名淑狄圖的女子繼位。阿國在十六世紀中，甚為擾亂，後來由葡萄牙人若干推倒回敎主義，將阿國置在羅馬統治之下，在這個時代中，領袖人物，有三位是皇后，伊們曾參加劇烈的戰爭，並且以治才管理朝政，很有美譽，所以阿國的女權是很大的</p>

<h3>嫁後的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 唐曹民女士</p>
<p>我的夫家，那什麽了丈夫以外，還有一位婆婆和一個小姑。我的丈夫，待我很好；只有道位太太的嚕囌，和我小姑的尖嘴，巳經够我受用了。每在我當着伊面的時候，伊對我一舉一動，都不入眼，總要有點批評。天天都是這樣對我說：「我年輕時也是做過媳婦的，在婆婆的面前，坐也不敢坐；絕不像你那麼腿裏沒有力似的，一走進來也不管長輩在面前，立刻把屁股擺在椅子上了。對尊長說話，也要輕聲柔氣；那能像你這相駡似的說話呢？唉！現在的時世變了！做媳婦的比做婆婆的還威風呢，有什麽規矩可講呢？只有你的丈夫，還當你是寳貝，我家祖宗早已在地下哭了！這眞是家門不幸。……」當伊說這麼一套話的時候，我只好忍氣呑聲的受着，好容易受完了，回到房中，不免橫在床上，掉幾點眼淚。那知我這僩小姑，竟不放鬆，即忙過來偷聽。聽了之後，就無中生有說我詛咒伊的媽，伊媽一聽了這話，不問眞假，就跑到我房中拍桌大駡，我也不敢回嘴，只好多哭些。更不敢吿訴我的丈夫，因為一吿訴他，他必定要說我不是，他無論如何，絕不肯說他媽和妹子的不好。像這樣足足的受了六年氣，我的婆婆死了，小姑嫁了，這時，老的巳死，小的已嫁，我方才心上放寬一點。那知我倆夫婦的愛情，又有點變動。因為我倆的愛，完全被初生的小孩子隔閡。二人的心，也遠遠的離開了。這樣一離，在我一方面，天天在家料理家務，哺養孩兒，却很安定。在他，那就不對了！他在外面竟娶了一個姨太太了！起初，他還想弄伊到家裏來住，後來幸虧教的哥哥出來說話，方才在外面另立門戶。從此，他天天不回來了，賺的錢，也拿出去瞎用了。於是我倆一見面，總是相打相駡，弄得像仇敵一般。我只好一人在家裏，靠幾個房錢，養活我母子二人。</p>
<p>去年，他的姨太太跟人跑了。他受了道刺激，方才回到家裏。頓時覺得我一言一動，與前不同，都含着誠意在裏面，深深的懊悔以前的舉動；我見他悔恨，就和他和好如初，同過着如新婚時的甜蜜生活。那知我生成的苦命，才過了幾個月的舒服日子，他又病了。他的病很是沉重，只拖了二三十天，花了很多的金錢，他竟死去了！</p>
<p>現在我們孤兒寡婦兩個人，一無恒產，（因為房子已經賣去還債，）只靠着別人帮助點過活。我叉是小學畢業生，不能自立；兒子又小，叫我靠誰呢？唉！天呀！</p>

<h3>統籌電政問題</h3>
<p>— 浩</p>
<p>月前披閱報章，見有行政院務處長蔣廷　先生之談話，主張調整各部會間及中央與地方間之職權，使無衝突重複之弊。同時對於電政一項，亦主張由語見之。夫統籌電政，爲吾全國電政同人數年來所竭誠企求而求之不得者也，今獲位高望重如蔣先生者瀋知及此，而思有以實現之，是誠電政前途之福音！用敢縷陳實况，謹供參考。</p>
<p>夫國家經營之電信，除海陸空機關爲軍用設置者外，均應由交通部統籌辦理、本爲電信條例規定。乃數年以來，先之有建設委員會建設無綫電事業之糾紛，繼之以各省省辦長途電話之敷設、以及非軍用機關之自設電臺。前者早歸併交部，幸告圓滿解决；而後二者正在接洽磋商中。吾人於此，除國家立法問題不必多言外，姑以數年來事實情狀言之，則上述兩個問題誠有及早解决之必要也。</p>
<p>查辦長途電話所設綫路，大抵與部辦長途話綫或電報綫並行，所到之處，减價競爭，雖曰便利民衆，實亦違反濟建設之原則。夫電信事業，經交通部數十年之經營，實已粗具規模，祇須地方從而協助，則理想的電信交通設備之完成，不難實現。今則省自爲政，於交部原有建設之外，多此疊牀架屋之舉，徒致備多力分，加重國庫省庫之負担，而數年來彼此競爭牽制之結果，反成相尅相制之局面，部辦電信事業，旣深受打擊，致無力完成國防電信建設之重大使命；而地方經濟，亦以維持省辦電信事業之故，深覺負担重重。故爲地方計，為國防計，亟應由中央統制全局，所有全國電信事業，統由交通部通籌辦理，而地方上則將此項電信建設經費，撥歸交部作擴充該省電信建設之用，或充作其他尙未舉辦而又切合目前需要的建設之用。如此中央地方，打成一片，分工合作，相見以誠，吾深信必能發揮偉大之力量，而大有補於國家前途也。</p>
<p>至非軍用機關自設電裏，亦爲數年來電政上之一重問題。其違背電信條例，損害立法尊嚴，固不待論。而擾亂空中秩序妨礙整個無綫電信交通，實爲通信之莫大障礙。此外對於電信經濟，亦多所打擊。故爲保持立尊嚴，維護電信交通，鞏固電信經濟計，則非軍用機關之自設電臺，亦有同時解决之必耍也。</p>
<p>上述兩事，吾全國兩萬餘電政員工數年前會呼籲請願？祈求當局解决者，徒以時機未至，素願未償，然而數年來對此有關電政命脈，國防前途之大問題之早日解决殷殷期望，未嘗須臾忘懷。今得蔣氏一言，無異空谷跫音，彌覺可喜。深信蔣氏處今日有為之時，居有為之位，對此偉大政策，必有充分權力促其實現，而慰同人喁喁之望也！</p>

<p>電報之功效，在求信息之傳達獲得最高之速度，凡寄發電報者，無不抱此種觀念，而希望其所發之電報，能於最短期間穩妥送到。電報局以供給此種服役為其職責，自亦應以最迅捷穩妥之方法傳遞，藉饜發電者之希冀。但在事實上，仍不免有所延擱者，考其原因，厥有二端：其一，為錢路之障礙與機件之損壞問題；其二，為電報之檢查問題。就前者言，錢路障礙與機件損壞，其發生，有時為不可避免與無可防禦之事實，發電者察知此種情形，多能予以諒解；就後者言，一般人往往有兩種觀念：第一，卽以電報局有以最迅捷穩妥之方法傳遞電報之義務，不容延擱；第二，卽以人民有通信秘密之權利，載在的法，不容妨害，因檢查電報而使電報有所延擱，甚或扣留，一方面旣已失迅捷穩妥之本旨，同時在另一方面，亦且妨害通信秘密之權利，以此對於電報局為檢查電報之故，多致懷疑與責難。誠然，此種懷疑與責難，不無相當理由，然而再作進一步之考察，則知檢查電報固有其合法之根據，同時因檢查而延誤或扣留，亦係不得已之事實，不能歸罪於電局，本文卽就此點，略加解釋。</p>
<p>首先吾人應深切明暸者：人民一切權利之行使，應以不妨害社會公共秩序與善良風俗為其規範，此為任何民治國家之所公認，以是人民無論言論行動，均不得逾越此合理之規範，同時政府為維持此項規範起見，亦得制定法令，以為保障，故的法上，雖規定人民有通信秘密之自由，同時亦有非依法律不得限制一項但書之規定。換言之，卽在原則上人民享有此種自由，在特殊情形，政府仍得依法予以限制也。電報為通信之一，自亦不能脫此範疇，故各國電信法令，均有明文，賦予政府及電局在特殊情形時以檢查電報之權力，我國國內電報營業通則第三十二條，亦明定電局對於電報之內容，認為妨害公共秩序或善良風俗者，得拒絕收受或停止其傳遞。第三十三條更規定電局收受密語電報，在軍事期間認為有檢查之必要時，得依法耍求發報人說明意義或交閱密本。如遇拒絕說明或說明不確實或拒絕交閱密本時得停止其傳遞。不過施行檢查，以遇有特殊情形或在軍事時期中為限，以免檢查權力之濫使。</p>
<p>現在我國若干區域，或因剿匪關係，或以特殊環境，當地軍政機關為策安全而杜亂源起見，多派員前往電局檢查電報，檢查結果，在手續上不免有所延擱，一般電報之傳遞，自不能如普通情形時之迅速。倘或檢查機關認為某電內容或有疑問，有時更加扣留，均係由於軍事上或政治上之必要，電局方面自不負責，且此種處置，在謀社會全體之安全及公衆之福利，為一般文明國家所採用，發電奢明乎此理，自亦不致懷疑與責難矣。</p>
<h3>談談編譯電報密碼的方法（續）</h3>
<p>— 消華</p>
<p>—請中國商家注意洋文密碼的優點—</p>
<p>關於編製和翻譯華文密碼的方法，記者巳在本刋上期內詳細談過，現在我來談談編製洋文密碼的方法：</p>
<p>洋文密碼，就是用羅馬字母組成的密碼，普通都是五個字母一組，在早幾年的時候，還有十個字母一組的密碼，但是實際上還是由五個一組的密碼兩組合成，因為圖節省報費起見，所以將兩組成為一個密碼。講到密碼的編製方法，與國際電報規則很有關係。記得國際電報規則最初規定洋文密碼，必須能够讀音，就是每一個密碼裏要有相當的韻母（Vowel），使得那個密碼字可以讀得出聲音來。這個條件似乎不很嚴厲，但是因為每個密碼字都是由兩組合成，所以時常有前後不能接聯讀音的，例如Sorch　Thmyl兩組合成Sorchthmyl一個密碼字，中聞有Cathm五個聲母（Consonant）相聯，當然不能讀音，照章就要照綴字語計費，就是照兩個字計算。但是發報人方面往往會說，這個字照某國文字是可以作為能讀音的，因此電局與發報人間，常會引起爭論。後來國際電報規則，特地修改為每個密碼字內，至少要有三個韻母，以免無謂的爭論。但是編製密碼的人，還是感覺因難，因為每組五個字母的密碼內，至少要一律含有兩個韻母，吾則兩組聯合起來，總難免只有兩個韻母的，就不合規定。直到最近才爽快的修改為密碼每字一律以五個字母為限，但沒有任何限制，報費則按全價十分之六計算。所以現在編製密碼，比以前容易得多，不必一定耍注意每字含有若干韻母，不過為便利電務人員閱讀拍發起見，每組密碼裹最好含有至少一個韻母，因為完全用聲母組成的密碼，電務人員必須注視着每個字母拍發，要是有一個韻母，一看就能强記着拍發，不必再三看着，下面舉一個例就可以明白；Dfwcs（無韻母）Chock（有韻母）。</p>
<p>上面說的是關於編製洋文密碼的基本條件，還有兩個很重要的條伴，一個是怎樣避免錯誤，一個是錯誤後怎樣推尋出正確的密碼字來。編製密碼第一要避免錯誤，要避免錯誤，就要使每個密碼字，與其餘的密碼字所含的字母，不同的越多越好。但是實際上，因為利用二十六個字母，編組很多的密碼字，若要每個密碼字所含的字母，彼此完全不同，當然是辦不到的，所以外國的商用密碼本，大都每個密字所含的五個字母，至少有兩個字母不同，這兩個不同的字母並須經過詳細審核，在拍發電報符號時，不致錯成另一密碼。為易於明瞭起見，舉一個例來說明：ABABK　ABACK上面兩個密碼字，只有末尾兩個字母不同，BK與CL的電報符號是相差很多，在拍發和抄收時，絕對不會BK錯成CL。要是CK與DC，那就難免魯魚之誤了！這一點在編製密碼上是十分重要的，因為某一密碼字錯成另一密碼字，就會把電文的意義變更，假定那原來密碼字是代表「貨價每箱六先令」，錯成「貨價每箱二先令。」那就要發生很嚴重的結果了。</p>
<p>上面說的某一密碼字，剛巧錯成另一密碼，要末尾的兩個字母全錯，才會發生，在事實上很是少見，因為商家所用的密碼本，大都是購置而並非自編，購置的密碼本都是由專家編訂，當然對於此點特別注意到，不致發生此類錯誤。不過每一密碼字祗錯一個字母，是比較常會發生的事，這在收到電報的人，不能譯成文字，也是一伴很煩惱的事，雖然可以立刻請求電局免費拍發業務公電去查問，但是總不免有所躭誤，所以編製密碼的第二個條件，是要便於推尋出正確的密碼，就是假定密碼字偶然錯了一個字母，可用種種方法推尋出原來正確的密碼字，要達到這目的，當然在於編製密碼時，有特別精確的設計。</p>
<p>記者曾見過一本密碼本，其特點有下列幾個：　每一密碼字均含有兩個韻母三個聲母，韻母的地位不拘，但兩個韻母均不相聯。　每一密碼字與其他密碼字至少有三個字母不同。　任何密碼字如將其倒拚，仍可成為一密碼字。以上三個特點，可使密碼字發生錯誤時，容易推尋出錯誤的所在，例如ABCAN一字錯成TBCAN，這字一看就知道少了一個韻母，這韻母的地位，非在第一個字母，卽在第二個字母，而aEIOU五個韻母的電報符號，大概都不會錯成B字，所以錯誤所在，一定是第一個字母。韻母中容易錯成T字者，祗AE兩字，先查ABCAN則有此密碼字，再查EBCAN卽無此密碼字，再把TBCAN倒拚成為NACBT，查密碼本內祗有NACBA而無NACBE，由此可以確定ABCAN是正確的密碼字。如該密碼字錯成ADCAN只須先查密碼本內有無此字，如沒有再查何字最為近似，再把他倒拚，在碼本內尋查最近似的字，由此可以推尋到正確的密碼字。</p>
<h3>模範報差</h3>
<p>上面舉的例，是只錯一個字母，要是錯兩個字母，雖然推尋時較為費事，但也非無法推尋出正確的密碼字，因為這個密碼本內的密碼字數目不多，（的有二千餘個）所以個個字都經過精密的選擇，除竭力避免錯誤外，對於推尋和糾正錯字，有許多便利，所以我國商行或私人仿此自編密碼，不僅較購置普通的密碼本容易保守秘密，並且偶然遇到錯誤時，可以立卽糾正，毫不躭誤要事，眞是一舉兩得的了！（記者按：利用洋文密碼發電，可以節省報費，並且减少錯誤的機會，讀者如欲詳細研究此問題），請投函本刋，當詳細奉告。）（完）模範報差</p>
<h3>爲禁報差需索酒貲事答客問</h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>從前電局報差，送電報到商家，商家往往必賞給酒資，或者平日不給，每逢過年過節，賞給一决，久而久之，成為定例。近年以來，電報業務，煥然一新，各處電局均登報聲明，嚴禁需索酒貲，懸為禁令，同時添派業務稽查員並稽查報差，時常到各商家查問，倘有此項事實發現，立刻將報差罰辦。卽有商家自動樂給，亦不許報差接受，並須用好言謝絕，此係各電報局禀承交通部整理報差之新猷也。</p>
<p>客曰：報差向商家索取酒貲，固然不可。倘商家自動情願賞給，何必不許接受？報差終歲勤動，商家亦何必吝此不予？</p>
<p>答曰：交通部嚴禁報差需取或接受酒貲，並非謂商家不可示惠於報差。實則因賞給酒資，影響業務甚鉅。茲將其應予嚴禁之理由答復如下：</p>
<p>報差投送電報，本係分內之事，報費旣經發報人付訖，收報人無再付送力之理。譬如信件郵貲，旣經發件人貼足，收件人當無再付送信錢之理也。</p>
<p>倘使每封電報，送到時卽賞給酒貲，久之成為習慣，報差認為此項係正當收入，商家照給，固不感謝，不給則反唇必駡，於電局名譽上大有妨碍。</p>
<p>此風一開，則賞給酒貲商家之電報，勢相爭先送到，不給者勢將不免故意延誤。卽或商家一律都賞給酒貲，事實上多少不一，厚薄旣分，流弊叢生。</p>
<p>商家為營業上之競爭，對於賞給酒貲，亦必引起競爭，甲賞五角，乙給一元，報差視賞錢之多寡，而定投送之先後，影響報務，殊非淺鮮！</p>
<p>報差為公務員工之一，有固定薪貲，究不可以茶役相比，美國電局報差，自視人格甚高，且多受中等敎育，且漸漸升任為報務機務人員。近來我國各局招考之報差，亦多受有中等敎育者。苟商家憐其勞苦，給予酒貲，直以茶役對待，是貶損報差人格也。</p>
<p>就以上各點觀之，為保持電局名譽計，為增加送報速率計，為免除商家麻改善，為提高報差人格計，是以交通部頒布報差管理規則，差報煩待遇計，嚴禁需取酒貲，具有深切意識也。</p>
<p>客曰：善。</p>
<h3>交部電司委託中國旅行代運電料</h3>
<p>— 松</p>
<p>交通部電政司為運輸電料便利起見，關於運料事宜，委託中國旅行社全權辦理，業於上年十二月簽訂合同，以資信守。凡交部所屬各電政機關所在地已設有旅社行社分或旅行社代理機關者，交部允將各該電政機關之各種電料報關運輸事宜，均委託旅行社或其代理機關辦理之。其中便科之點，可得而言之：</p>
<p>查電料為發展電信事業之源泉，苟電料缺乏或供應不宜，雖有優良機件，通暢電路，與精敏人手，均無所施其作用。蓋電局之於電料，猶軍人之於槍彈，苟槍枝缺乏或彈不足用，雖有貅貔十萬，亦難克敵政果也。又電料之儲轉處，亦如軍部之儲備司，苟運輸不靈，供求不一，雖屯儲萬庫，亦無益矣。故電料之轉運，關係效率之高低，猶之軍需之運輸，關係軍事之勝負也。</p>
<p>我國幅員遼闊，全國電局，星羅棋布，所需電料，除少數由各局核准自行購辦外，其大部份，均由上海儲轉處分發各大局，再由各大局轉運全國各小局，輾轉收發，多稽時日。且運送無規定辦法，損失自所難免！至於軍事倥偬之時，水潦已降之際，道途梗塞，匪盜堪虞，電局旣無押運人員，又無運輸經驗，是以電料多未能如期運到，而需料之局，急如星火，若望雲霓。此並非轉運之局，故意稽延，實因運料制度不健全運料機關不統一之故耳。</p>
<p>今茲委託中國旅行社承運電料，其所訂合同利益之點有三：</p>
<p>凡交部及所屬各機關交運之電料，除每伴體積3×4×5英尺者，或每件重量逾地噸者，或須由直放輪船運往重慶者外，旅行社均應於三日以內代為運出交運地點，至運往重慶者，旅行社應於接得代運電料後第一决開行之船內，代為運出一百噸。</p>
<p>旅行社為酬答交部盛意起見，除某某二家運費按照運率八折收費外，其餘各船公司運費，允在船公司所給折扣佣金內提出若干，退還交部。至鐵路運價，如用交部半價執照，仍應按半價繳付。</p>
<p>交部曁所屬各電政機關委運電料，得委託旅行社代為保險，如未保險而在途發生事故，致受損失，旅行社仍負依法交涉賠償及退回運費之責。至電料在途遺失，應由旅行社負責照價賠償。</p>
<p>以上係電局方面之便利也。至旅行社方面，亦有如下利益之可言；</p>
<p>營業之推廣：交部附屬電政機關旣滿布全國，旅行社承運電料，不啻將其營業範圍，擴展至全國電局所在地，將來電信營業發達，旅行社營業，亦將隨之發達。</p>
<p>信譽之日著：旅行社辦理旅行業務，頗得社會上之信仰，今承運全國電料，增加聲譽不少矣。</p>
<p>承運員之優待：旅行社押運員，在辦理期內之旅費膳費，由交部津貼每日二元，曁往返三等火車票價或輸船房艙稟價。</p>
<p>夫電信為國營事業，需要全國各方合作者甚殷。交部電司曾經委託中國旅行社代收電報，今又委託該社承運電料，足見推誠相與，彼此利益甚多。而電信事業，正在發展之時，求各方合作之機會甚夥，吾知目光遠大之企業家，必有聞風而起者矣。</p>
<h3>提倡國產電料之商榷</h3>
<p>— 葆眞</p>
<p>最近在報紙上曾有下列一段紀載：</p>
<p>「海關息：去年全年洋貨進口凈值九一·九二一·一三三·二二元，國貨出口凈值五七五·八零八·零六零元，入超計三四三·四零二·二六二元。金銀進口共值一零·九九六·七六八元，出口共值七零·三九四·三九七元，出超計五九·三九七·六二九元。較前年均减少。」</p>
<p>由此可知我國去年之洋貨入超，竟達三萬四千三百四十萬二千二百六十二元之多，同時現金現銀的出超，共計五千九百三十九萬七千六百二十九元，為數至堪驚人。長此以往，我國財富之竭蹶，指日可待。故一般愛國志士為挽回利權，减少漏巵起見，竭力提倡國貨，以免白銀外流，而發展國內工業，確為當今我國不可稍緩之經濟政策。吾人際此提倡國貨迅動聲中，不得不聯想到電局材料問題，因為全國電局所需一切村料，如收發電報的來報紙，去報紙，轉報紙，貼報紙，及莫氏機上所用之藍紙條，藍墨油，波紋機上所用之白紙條，韋氏機上所用之油紙條，報話工程上所需之銅錢，電纜，水綫，鍍鋅鐵錢及磁碗及電報電話各種機器，每年銷耗數量之鉅，佔全國各電局營業支出之重耍項目。交通部每年向外洋或洋行標購材料所需鉅額價欵，當然亦為整個入超之一部份。</p>
<p>交通部現已設有電信機料修造所及電信機料試騐所兩個機關，辦理修造與試騐事宜，略具規模。至於製造電料部份，雖曾計劃自設工廠，製造各電局所需材料，俾一切電料之供應，都不必仰給於外貨。嗣因限於財力，一時尙難擴充。惟我國旣已有國人自辦之造紙廠，各電局所需紙張，儘可由廠家用國產原料製造。該廠如能與交通部訂立產銷合作辦法，儘量設計製造電局所用之各種紙張，則交通部不必向外貨公司標購，而向該廠訂購，如是，必在入超之數字上，可以减少若干，於整個國家經濟不無裨益。深望國人自辦之造紙廠，能注意及此，進一步與交通部商訂合作辦法，在造紙廠方面，可以推廣營業，貨暢其流。在交通部方面則電料來源有自，供應不虞竭蹶，旣可提倡國貨，又可發展紙業，一譽數得，何樂不為。</p>
<p>其次，我國向以出產磁器馳名世界，允以江西一省為最著名。電局建築電報電話架空，所需磁碗，為數頗多。此項磁碗亦係仰給於外貨，我國旣出產磁器，贛省或他處製造磁器之廠家，能悉心研究磁碗之功用及其製造方法，我國自製磁碗，似非難事。倘對於製造磁碗或尙缺乏經濟，則不妨商請交通部指派技術人員前往指導監製。國產磁碗果能質料優良，隔電力大，切合實用，自必為交通部所採用，對於磁業前途自多利賴，此則希望國內磁器製造廠與交通部合作者也。</p>
<p>再有鬣報電話所設架空綫路，大都均用鍍鋅鐵錢。此項鍍鋅鐵綫，多係舶來品，每磅除綫價外，須加運費若干，殊非經濟之道。我國規樓較大之鐵工廠如能自造各種鍍鋅鐵綫（例如十六號鐵錢八號鐵綫等），則交通部每年修造綫路所需者均可不必採用外貨，當可塞絕一部份漏巵，而國產金鐵工業，亦可獲得出路也。</p>
<p>以上所述紙張，磁碗，鐵錢等物，均為我國各大造紙廠磁器廠鐵工廠所能製造，其原料亦均可採用國產。夫電信交通為國之喉舌，一旦國際戰事發生，外貨電料來源斷絕，如無國產電料足以供應，影響所及，殊非淺鮮。故提倡國產電料，不僅挽回利權，抑且關係軍事通信，際茲提倡國貨聲中，此項電料問題，似未可忽視也。</p>
<h3>電話用戶應該明瞭的幾件事</h3>
<p>— 靑</p>
<p>電話為公衆日常生活所需要之工具，與公衆有密切之關係，故電話局與用戶日常接洽的事項，也十分繁多。如果下列幾伴事不為公衆所明瞭，則用戶與話局間的關係，往往不能十分和諧，甚至發生許多隔膜。現在把用戶應該明暸的幾件事，寫在後面：</p>
<p>關於徵收費方面的：話局對於裝用電話各戶，除按照章程收取各項費用外，並無絲毫零星的花費，所有收費章程，均經刋入電話號簿篇首，用戶一閱便知。至於話局向用戶收取各費時，都有正式收據，據上加蓋話局關防及主管課股的圖章。但各地良莠不齊，難保沒有假造收據向用戶詐索情事。為防杜這種弊竇起見，用戶對於話局收費單據，必須辨明眞偽，才付話費。至於請裝電話，可向話局直接接洽，除一切正常費用外，無須其他費用，社會上常有一般不良份子，欺騙一部份不懂裝用電話手續的入，藉端居間介紹，向用戶收取挖費，務請公衆注意，幸勿受愚。</p>
<p>關於電話號簿方面的電話號簿係每半年或一年編刋一次，列行時或有幾家用戶未經刋入者，這般用戶，見自己戶名未曾刋入，往往向話局詰責，甚有以不付月租來抵抗者，殊不知未經刋入的原因，並非由於話局的疏忽，而係號簿付刋時，該戶尙未掛號，或雖已掛號，尙未實施裝設。再號簿編竣，交付印刷商排印，亦需相當時日，才能完事。在此相當時日之內，陸續到話局掛號的新裝戶，往往不及補入，這也是無可如何的一伴事，希望用戶方面予以諒解。俟每月發行用戶變動表，來補救此項缺憾。</p>
<p>關於裝修移拆機件方面的凡話局所派工匠，到用戶宅內裝機，修機，移機，拆機，或查修綫路均持有派工執照，或修綫憑單，請話戶隨時索閱，以免假胃。至派工執照，並請用戶於工匠工作完畢時，檢騐工作，簽名蓋章。工匠絕對不得向話戶需索酒資。希望用戶方面亦不自動給予。如有私自需索者，請卽報吿電話局或業務稽查員，以便查究罰辦。再話機損壞，有須用戶繳費賠償者，均須經由話局切實審核，於修理之前，通吿話戶，並註明物品名稱價目，由用戶到局繳納，另給正式收據。因工匠祇負修理，不收費用之責。</p>
<p>關於共他事項方面的有一般用戶因不明利弊，往往私自移機，換機，或加裝分機，或因技術不良之故，草率從事，以致引起通話不良的弊病。有時誤觸燈綫，允為危險。另有一般用戶因尙未明暸自行更名過戶免收費用的規定，往往私自更名過戶，以致用戶戶名不準確，引起通話人的不滿。須知欲維持話務於完善，話局固不能辭其責任，但用戶方面也要通力合作，希望以後各地用戶對於上述事項，都報請話局辦理，那麽整個電話組織上的維持，得以完善，這想是每個用戶願意帮忙的。</p>
<h3>交部招商承辦報話代辦處</h3>
<p>— 驊</p>
<p>交通部鑒於我國幅員遼闊，報話通信尙未普通設置，對於民衆通信未臻便利。爰經仿照部政代辦所之成例，在未設電報局處地方推行報話代辦處招商承辦報話通信事宜。</p>
<p>自代辦處制度推行以來，全國各地成立者已有百數十處。上海附近之莘莊·七賓·泗涇·靑浦·朱家閣等處，向無報話通信設備，現已先後成立代辦處，與各地通信。其他如蘇屬之同里·黎里·王江涇等處，商業均頗繁盛，現亦各設代辦處與各地聯絡通信。</p>
<p>上述各代辦處，均與交部所設之報話幹錢相依近，故接錢工程，極為簡易。而在承辦商人方面，祗須覓一殷實舖保，卽可呈請代辦。故推行甚為順利。惟內地各省報話鐵路較簡。偏僻之處往往距離錢路經過之處頗遠，所需桿綫亦頗鉅。交部為顧念當地民衆需要起見，常不惜巨資，建立桿錢。而民衆方面，有時亦願供給欵項，呈請築綫設處，如山東蓬萊附近之藥家口，係該地商會捐輸鉅欵，請求交部設綫通話，卽共一例。</p>
<p>查代辦處報話費之收入，按照規定以百分之八十報解，百分之二十留充代辦費，其他如長途電話來話專力費相等金額，電報來報專力費去報譯費，亦一併充作代辦費，然則承辦商人，不僅謀當地通信之便利，抑亦為本身營業增益也。</p>
<p>吾嘗聞日本電報創辦之初，其內地偏僻錢路，大率由常地民衆醵資架設仍歸政府經營，其所以致此之由，固係環境與事實之需要。抑亦民衆嘹然於人民與政府合作之重要，踴躍輸將。吾信在交部推行報話代辦處政策之下，內地民衆必能逐漸認識報話通信之重要，與政府作切實之合作，以完成吾國神經系統之通信網也。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>大學生受極刑</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>前些時，嘗有人大呼中國敎育破產，其因起於少數中少數的從事敎育者的「無行，然亦有些「邦人君子」認為「世風日下」，所以卽是最高智識階級者，亦不免受了點「影響」，這麽一說，便可把穢行劣蹟統扔進「世風」裏去，敎育本身不負一絲責任，我們得承認其「婉轉」的「聰敏」。</p>
<p>日前杭州當局鎗斃了三個殺人勒贖的綁票匪，而三匪中沒一個不是「貨眞價實」，的大學生，這就足使我吃驚非淺！以大學生的本身論，所受的敎育程度，所得到的社會知識，比一般人為高了，在此時，正應做社會的前驅者，國民的優秀分子。以大學生的環境論，家庭想必富裕，卽不富裕，亦不至淸貧，旣無生活負擔，又無外界雜務，身居最高學府，抽冰馬桶與公司大菜，享受非薄，此時正可「埋首窗下」，雖不必要像「蘇秦刺股」，亦須「派司」得過。乃該三大學生不之此圖，一昧熱妓女，荒蕩揮霍，爺老子的汗血不够，歹念一起，就想別人家的錢了，淫慾與金錢佔據了他們的全部理智，於是「身敗名裂」。</p>
<p>這樣說來，大學生做綁匪，似乎又與「世風」不無關係了？</p>
<p>其實所謂「世風」，究竟不像傳染病菌都樣害人。觀夫今日之下的大學生，眞能一志向學的有多少？終日混混噩噩，想騙一張「文憑」的，又有多少？而把父母血汗金錢，揮耗於一聲色之塲」，整天的「講情談愛」，自甘「下流」的，允屈指難數。敎育破產與否，可不問，世風下不下，亦可不問，所耍問者，一般大學生在學校中幹了什麽？而學校當局又要他們幹過什麽？</p>
<p>有一位高中二年級的學生說：「我眞希望立刻進大學」。或問他的目的，他說進了大學，功課反寬閒，就可舒服不少了。這是實情。白天跑到大學生宿舍裏去，躺覺抽烟的至少二人，哼京調的至少一人，開留聲機片學舞的至少三人……這是「又一鐵證」。可是，這在學校當局是視為司空見慣」的事，而無注意的價值與必要。這我們該責怪誰呢？</p>
<p>飽暖空閒而思淫樂，爺老子的錢化光了，就起竊盜心，雖然杭州鎗斃了三個做綁匪的大學生，這「烱戒」的效果，恐終於有限吧。總希望還是在敎育方面想想法子！</p>
<h3>門外的步聲</h3>
<p>— 天騏</p>
<p>不知從那一晚起，就聽到有人在門外那條碎石子舖的路上來回的踱着。那槖槖槖的有節拍似的聲音，當我躱到床上未入睡之前，總很淸楚的傳進耳邊。在冷淸的夜心裏，什麽聲音都寂靜下去了，為什麽還有人挨着寒風在那裏踱步呢？起初我很驚怪，也許是竊賊吧？不然就是那一家的脫繮馬了，這麼一想，心裏倒微微不安起來，但隨細細聽淸下去，我又立卽决定這聲音確是從一個人從容不迫的脚步下擦起來的皮鞋聲。假使說是竊賊吧，就决不會這放胆走路的。因此，我不復再加注意，就是那一個過路人偶然停在這兒等他的同伴吧。我安然睡下了。</p>
<p>可是，到了第二夜，這槖槖棄的聲音仍然在這冷淸的門外嚮起來，而且與前夜的情形沒有一些異樣，除此以外還是聽不出有其他動靜。就此一連幾夜，我於是漸漸厭憎起來了。心想，再這麽過下去，我將要無法在一定的時刻睡下，日裹的精神不是無端受了損害嗎。心裏不由不更焦煩了。有幾决，我眞想走出去，把這三更半夜還來人家門外擾人淸睡的無賴呵斥一番，再打他一記耳光吧，看他還有什麽話對我說不？但是想雖這樣想，一轉念間，我的弱點又暴露出來了，覺得這到底是造决的舉動，與自己恐無多大益處吧　。只好耐住性子，換取個消極辦法：不聽不理，睡覺要緊。我努力縮小呼吸，把頭伸入被裏。</p>
<p>這個法子自然仍歸失敗，結果是更難入寐。我憤然了，有一夜我再耐不住，不顧一切，披着件睡衣開門出去，正要揚個惡聲，對付他，抬頭一看，在靜靜的路燈光量之下我看淸了那人原來是一個黑衣黑裳的站夜岡的警察。他也似乎早聽到有人從這弄裏走出來，就站在那兒朝我這邊望過來。在兩相對視之下，剛纔的一團憤恨忽變作滿懷歉意了，我可以憑什麽理由來斥責他嗎？當時我確是這麽責備自己的鹵莽。平素常駡人只知自私自利，那知落到自己頭上還不是一樣；而且情形也尷尬極了，要不要跟他打個問訊呢？這眞難以取决的事情；就卽回身退轉來吧，這麽鬼鬼祟祟的舉止難道不使他生疑麼？我眞有點茫然了。</p>
<p>幸好，他似乎幷不懷疑到我會有什麽異動，若無其事地背轉身走了。當他的冷冷的背影漸漸隱沒在黑影之中，籬北外面忽然吹來一陣冷風，打我肩頭掃過，我纔想起身上只披了一件薄薄的睡衣，打了一個寒噤，乘機退到房子裏來，等到我重睡到床上去的時候，那槖槖棄的有節拍似的聲音又在門外走過了。</p>
<p>從那夜起，每當聽到這槖槖棄的鞋聲，心裹卽感到無限歉仄。若是寒風凍雪加深了的時候，這個守夜人也還是在這條碎石子路上挨着生活的重壓拖着　棄槖的鞋聲嗎？</p>
<p>唉，我那能不感到歉仄呢，我太安逸了。</p>
<h3>東園的主人</h3>
<p>— 辛爾</p>
<p>在東中野下車，人沒入在幽秀的園林似的。木屋前後的沙石路裏，恬靜淸適的家家門內外，都是秀凈輕鬆，這情調算是我所挺歡喜的。這島上，該住着優秀的人們吧！行一會，前面便是束園，推開竹籬門，繫在籬門的鈴聲幽靈淸澈的響了一陣。這是我的朋友的下宿處，是個貸間。進去後，主人，一個臉孔陰沉而裝出笑容的四十多歲的退伍軍人，他輕輕，而又鄭重的說，方先生還沒有起來呢？</p>
<p>使我很懷疑，講了好一會，主人，和主人的女兒，還都不敢進去呌醒老方，雖然我說由我負責，包他不怨到主人。</p>
<p>一直坐等到老方的房內響出呌喚聲，主人的女兒纔進去伏侍他，而後請我進去。</p>
<p>我們兩個的話拉到這主人的身上來，我問他，你的主人對待你好不好呢？老方只是笑，找出一本日記來？翻出幾處呌我看一看，然後說，你坐着看吧，我出去打電話呌東西來吃。於是，我看了下去。</p>
<p>『初搬進來，退伍軍人的房主，是拿眼睛來看我，而極少用話和我說，我很想立刻搬走呢』。</p>
<p>『第一决說話是關於地圖而引起的。他指着壁上所掛的地圖，高興的說了！是不是？日本這麼小，支那這麽大，英國的殖民地印度也很大呵！我覺得不願聽下去，但他的話是太有意思了，使我忍耐着？他接下去就是誇耀他是幾年前打滿洲的有功軍官，滿洲也比日本來得大，可是，——目光望一望我。我驚異他說得這樣自然和堂皇。好像這是非常合理而成為一種正義似的。』</p>
<p>『第二次說到圍　和日本將棋，他說，圍　從前雖然是支那的，但現在支那沒有了，在日本成為了不起的藝術，只要下得够上段就一生不愁沒飯吃。而且，將棋，就是日本獨有的了。他得意的要敎我，這你們支那是沒有的。可是，這日本將棋恰就和支那的象棋一樣，只是增加了幾隻子，和把子由圓改成尖的，仍舊是將士象馬砲卒兵。第一次的敎授，却就給我這學徒打敗了，我的那只馬走得特別好。主人驚異的，稱我為天才了！我不由不笑了，這就從支那的象棋來的，他却疑為我是天才！』</p>
<p>『第三决他問我，坦然的：十九路軍挺坯的，是不是？他還給我介紹一種菜名呌馬占山菜，使我更覺得奇異，奇異自己是在做夢吧？原來這兒已長了二種流傳了！最可恨的是十九路軍，最可氣的是馬占山。把一種菜切成粉碎而吃，呌馬占山菜。我們早已忘記了這些，虧他提醒起來呵！』</p>
<p>『可是，一個月後，情形全不同了。因為我每月包他的飯，却因每天必睡至午後才起，所以一頓飯沒吃，主人可白賺七八元，月初卽先交四十元給主人，一切由他包，也不曾淸算他。這麽樣之後，主人的女兒也被父親呌來服待我了呢。天才家之外，主人挺怕我發脾氣，這也便連累了朋友。朋友來時，總得坐待，主人不敢呌醒我。我就這怪脾氣，睡不足起來是無法無天的。不過，這可糟了，比在自家裏還還好發脾氣，以後將養成更不好的性子吧』。</p>
<p>『好幾個月不曾聽到主人說：支那人這個，那個了呵！這是為什麼？主人以為我是多闊的闊老呢』！</p>
<p>我看到這裏，纔俯下頭去，老方回房來了，他不住搖頭，問明白，原來是：老方請主人打電話去呌蛋火腿兩客，主人茫然打了電話，回說沒有這東西。老方自己再打，仍舊是沒有。直到老方把蛋火腿倒成火腿蛋，對方才恍然大悟：</p>
<p>『哦，哦，火腿蛋然有啦！』主人也唔了好一會。</p>
<p>我對老方望望，一時說不出話，老方愕然，東園內寂然無聲。斜着窗外幽雅的景物，另種滋味湧上心頭，感到咽喉攔住許多東西似的。</p>
<p>而主人還又在向天才家要不要下將棋呢！</p>
<h3>別墅的故事</h3>
<p>— 洪英</p>
<p>我每回從村里到Manila去購貨，總是坐老普金那輛老得只好去上博物院的載重馬車，這輛破馬車是由一匹灰白色有着氣喘病的老駑馬駕駛着的。在這團團有七方里左右的村落里，只有三輛馬車；連洛，皮克，和老普金。連洛和皮克，因為他們底馬車是簇新的，所以生意倒還不錯，每到大淸早，天還沒有全亮便會有人去敲他們底門。點着椰油燈，連洛（或皮克）便會睡態朦朧的，用袖口揩去眼睛里的眼糞，大聲的打着呵欠，套好馬，爬上御者台去，輕輕的揚着鞭，望村道上滴滴走去。而老普金的却就差了，每星期能够看見他滿面漲得通紅，嘴里悠閑的咬着烟斗，倨然的坐在御者台上，大聲吆喝着，呼呼的揚着鞭，從不曾超過三决的；於是他着了念，便每天晚上，在這條柔靜的小街上，用着胆怯的步伐團團的走着，到處向人家</p>

<h3>Pictured: The New Japanese Ambassador to China, Arida</h3>
<p>Nanjing – Ambassador Arima, who bid farewell to President Jiang, Minister Zhang, and other key figures in the National Government, told reporters today about his impressions of leaving office: "I took office as the Japanese Ambassador to China three and a half years ago, which was after the Shanghai Incident, the worst period. Later, thanks to the efforts of officials and civilians of both countries, the situation gradually improved. It can be said that after the declaration of the pro-Japanese policy by the two Jiangs last spring, it improved even further. Although there were issues such as the North China problem, there were inevitably ups and downs, but the atmosphere has gradually become clearer. Because the situation when I took office was too bad, I could not allow it to deteriorate further, so I doubled my efforts. This move seemed difficult but was actually easy. If the various problems that are occurring today had occurred then, various difficulties would have followed. Its difficulty is even greater than in the past. My successor, Ambassador Arida, has experience in China, is young and energetic, and has a good reputation, so he is naturally a suitable person. However, for these various difficulties, I must hope for your support. When I went to Minister Zhang Qun's office to bid farewell the other day, Zhang gave me farewell remarks. In my reply, I said, 'It is impossible to know whether various events will occur in the future. However, I deeply believe that in terms of geography, history, culture, and race, China and Japan should cooperate to achieve peace in the Orient, seek coexistence and co-prosperity, and contribute to world peace. This is the only way. Therefore, we must not be constrained by small matters, but must proceed from a grand and distant perspective towards the eternal goal. If we are constrained by minor details, it is easy to forget the great eternal goal. I hope you will consider this point and move towards the ultimate goal.' My words are based on the deep belief that every time a minor incident occurs, it causes restlessness and only worsens the feelings of the people of the two countries that have already improved. This is not a good plan. I am convinced that if the two countries approach the current small problems with a tolerant attitude and move towards this great goal, there is no reason to be pessimistic about the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations. Looking at recent Japanese thinking, it seems that there is a tendency to believe that everything Japan does is right and that the arguments of foreigners who oppose Japan are wrong. This matter seems to require considerable caution to a certain extent. It is true that belittling oneself will not gain the respect of others, but to arrogantly say that everything done by people other than Japanese is bad is something that may need to be re-examined. The same is true regarding Sino-Japanese relations, and we must pay attention to this point, treating each other with love and respect, and acting based on so-called justice. Since we are a major power and the leader of the Orient, this is only natural. In the three and a half years I have been in office, I have not been very satisfied, but I have been able to do so without major errors until today. For this, I should express my gratitude to all parties." (31st Denchu Dispatch)</p>

The vote on the motion of confidence in the government will only be submitted for voting at 7:30 PM tomorrow. (Havas dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>Paris: After Premier Sarraut read out the administrative policy, all parties on the left wing of the Chamber of Deputies expressed their welcome, while the parties on the right wing showed no agreement and paid little attention during the reading. Despite this attitude of the right wing, it is believed that the new government will certainly obtain the trust of a majority of 150 votes. (Reuters dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>Paris: Today, the Chamber of Deputies meeting was packed, and the atmosphere was quite tense. Premier Sarraut attended and read out the new cabinet's policy declaration, first stating domestic affairs, then discussing foreign affairs, and concluding with a conclusion. The following is a record of</p>
<p>the foreign policy section, which stated, "The government will firmly follow the foreign policy adopted by France in the past 20 years and will not change the following two laws: to abide by the obligations stipulated in international treaties to maintain peace; and to develop a collective security system in accordance with the principles of the League of Nations. Therefore, under the protection of the League of Nations and in the spirit of friendly understanding, this government will do its utmost to support anything that can facilitate a convenient and rapid resolution of the Italian-Ethiopian dispute and bring a swift end to the murderous hostilities. Our peaceful relations with all countries, whether it be Belgium, the Little Entente countries, Italy, Poland, the Soviet Union, or the United Kingdom, have the sole purpose of maintaining peace and organizing a peaceful system within the framework of the League of Nations, and we absolutely do not want to use this to seek our own interests. As for the United Kingdom, if it works in harmony with France, it is guaranteed to be the main guarantee of peace in Europe. Republican France has the sincerity to achieve broad understanding in Europe and is now prepared to contact all peace-loving countries, and hopes that Germany also has the sincerity for peace." In Premier Sarraut's declaration, regarding</p>
<p>the domestic policy section, it briefly stated, "The new government has a compromising nature, while still maintaining unremittingly the republican system. It has a very broad plan, and its main task is to preside over the next election of the Chamber of Deputies, ensuring that this election obtains all kinds of guarantees, that is, the government will hold an honest and impartial spirit and respect the freedom of voting and public opinion. As for</p>
<p>the economic aspect, the government must revitalize all economic activities in order to improve the financial situation, because in order to guarantee the position of the franc, the financial situation urgently needs to be rectified by the government." Sarraut's</p>
<p>conclusion stated that the government's policy is roughly based on the following points: citizens enjoy peace; the people of the whole country strictly observe discipline; and make the national law have the highest authority, because only after public security and street order are respected can the material and spiritual conditions for the revival of the undertaking be realized. The authority of the state can only be held by the government, and the military and police who guarantee the safety of citizens can only be mobilized by the government. The government takes the maintenance of France's supreme interests as its duty and will prohibit those who disrupt peace and punish those who undermine peace. This responsibility will be strictly fulfilled and will not be slightly exceeded. All Republicans will be able to stand behind the government." Finally, Premier Sarraut asked the people of the whole country to remain calm and not to take any rash actions, "Otherwise, not only will disturbances occur domestically, but foreign troubles will also follow one after another, which must be taken seriously."

<h3>Parliamentary Vote: New Cabinet to Gain Confidence; Right Wing Attacks Government</h3>
<p>Paris: The Chamber of Deputies continued its meeting in the afternoon today. Most of the members of the right wing and the right wing of the Socialist Party criticized the complexity of the new cabinet members. The members of the left wing mostly expressed their approval. Among them, the former Governor of Vietnam, Valena, a member of the New Socialist Party, strongly supported it. After the questioning by members of various parties was over, Premier Sarraut was scheduled to answer at 3:00 PM today, and then adjourn the meeting for half an hour. Then, the members who originally raised the question expressed their opinions on the motion of confidence. It is expected that when the vote on the motion is taken in the evening, the opinions among the members will be very divergent. Generally speaking, the attitude of the Socialist Party in today's debate is the main factor determining the fate of the government. Since some members of the party have already expressed their support for the government, the new cabinet is actually very likely to obtain the support of a majority of votes. (Havas Agency dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<p>Paris: The Radical Socialist Party parliamentary group held a meeting and unanimously decided to vote in favor of the Sarraut cabinet. (Havas Agency dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<p>Paris: Tonight, members of the right wing and the center-right wing, including Puyusha, the leader of the nationalist faction, launched a scathing attack on the government. Puyusha explained that the new Minister of Aviation, Te A (a member of the Chamber of Deputies of the Left-Wing Republican Socialist and Righteous Union), is a fervent anti-capitalist, while the Minister of Finance, Reynier, is a conservative of financial orthodoxy. The doctrines held by the two are diametrically opposed. Now they are listed as colleagues. Isn't this contradictory? He also said, "The organization of the new cabinet is influenced by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is said to support peace, but in the past five years, one-third of China's Outer Mongolian territory has been stained by it. What peace is there?" (Havas dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<h3>Herriot's Speech Defends Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Paris: Former Radical Socialist Party leader and former Minister without Portfolio, Herriot, delivered a speech in the Chamber of Deputies today, defending his attitude towards the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, saying, "The Italian-Ethiopian dispute is actually a conflict between the old concept of secret diplomatic strategy and the new diplomatic thought, or a conflict between the collective policy and the law of the jungle of wild beasts (left-wing members applauded enthusiastically). I, as Minister without Portfolio in the Laval's former cabinet, did my best to defend the traditional policy of France on the issue of implementing the League of Nations covenant to sanction Italy. The intention was actually for the sake of the Little Entente countries, because those countries may one day be in the same position as Abyssinia. I also tried to ensure that France's traditional policy was not hindered, and that the Little Entente countries would not feel discouraged. I believe that I can be proud of the country." Herriot then recounted the Geneva Protocol in 1924, when he was the Prime Minister (stipulating measures to sanction aggressor countries, which was formulated by the United Kingdom and France to prevent German aggression, but it was not established because it was not approved by the British Parliament, and the Locarno Treaty was completed the following year), making a defense, "We have repeatedly advocated international morality in Geneva and other places, and there should be international law to back it up, tirelessly, just to make the United Kingdom accept it. Now, British public opinion has approved of this proposition, so can French public opinion adopt the opposite stance? The actions of the British government are always in line with its domestic public opinion. It can be seen that the proposition of France has been victorious. Now, if we listen to those who faithfully adhere to the French proposition and are attacked by others, it is a very serious mistake." Herriot then replied to the right-wing newspapers, which had attacked his past work in drawing together France and Russia, and recently he was again attacked by the right wing when he was the Minister without Portfolio, "My actions have been decided after careful consideration. This decision to resign from the post of Minister without Portfolio can no longer be delayed. I have cooperated with the successive 'truce cabinets' for two years, enduring insults without arguing. It can be seen that my purpose is only for the sake of the future of the country, and there is no private interest in it." (Havas dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<h3>Impressions in Rome on French Cabinet's Foreign Policy Declaration; Welcoming Initiation of Mediation; War of Aggression to Continue</h3>

<p>London: Recently, Foreign Secretary Eden took advantage of the presence of diplomatic officials from various countries in England to attend the funeral of the late King George V, and held separate talks with them. All the details have been repeatedly recorded in previous telegrams. It is now learned that when Foreign Secretary Eden recently talked with Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov and French Foreign Minister Flandin, he made some statements to the two on the issue of the demilitarized zone on both sides of the German Rhineland, saying that from his point of view, there is no imminent danger of Germany violating the treaty and re-fortifying the area. Regarding this matter, it is reported that after German Foreign Minister Neurath met with Eden, Germany felt deeply that international cooperation on the Italian-Ethiopian dispute was seamless. It will take a wait-and-see policy on the issue of the demilitarized zone on both sides of the Rhine. If the League of Nations' policy towards Italy does not fail one day, then Germany will not act rashly one day. Political figures here believe that in the event that Germany violates the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles and re-fortifies on both sides of the Rhine, the United Kingdom and France will be forced to approach each other militarily in accordance with Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. This is what Germany is wary of. In addition, regarding the talks between Austrian Deputy Prime Minister Starhemberg and Prime Minister Baldwin and Foreign Secretary Eden, it is said that results have been obtained. The most important thing is that in the future, the influence of Italy in Austria will decline, and the "Western European democratic countries," that is, the United Kingdom, will rise to replace it. According to semi-official sources, if Starhemberg visits Archduke Otto, the successor of the Habsburg old royal family, in Steenokkerzeel, Belgium, or Vaduz, Liechtenstein (both places are the residences of the Austrian old royal family), when he returns to his country from England, he intends to persuade the Archduke not to be too hasty on the issue of restoration. According to the original leader of the Austrian royalist party, if he initiates this suggestion, it will have a great impact on the situation in Central Europe. (Harkis dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<h3>Hitler's Third Anniversary in Power; Berlin Celebrates Extensively; 30,000 Party Troops Parade</h3>
<p>Berlin: Yesterday was the third anniversary of the National Socialist Party's assumption of power. Extensive celebrations were held here, as if it were the New Year. In the evening, 35,000 people from the Stormtroopers, the Protection Squad, the Motorized Army, and the National Socialist Youth League paraded with torches. Leader Hitler stood on a specially made platform and looked at the railings. When he saw so many loyal believers passing in front of him, he raised his arm to salute, with a peaceful attitude. It took two hours to complete. Among the ranks, the most eye-catching were the grandson of the deposed Emperor Wilhelm II and the "Austrian guest army." The latter held a small flag with the words "German Austria pays tribute to Leader Hitler." The parade ended with the members of the National Socialist Girls League as the rear guard. At 8:30 PM, fireworks were set off, and the crowd shouted "Long live Leader Hitler," and the sound waves lasted for a long time. Then they paraded through the streets until 1:00 AM after midnight before dispersing. It was extremely grand for a time. Yesterday also marked the beginning of the fourth year of the National Socialist Party's rule. Leader Hitler took this good opportunity to send telegrams to General Hindenburg, the son of the late President, Papen, the ambassador to Austria, and Hugenberg, the former leader of the German Steel Helmet League, to extend his congratulations. (Havas dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<p>Berlin: Hitler declared today at the celebration of the third anniversary of his administration that the German nation is a peace-loving nation, but if the honor of the German nation is attacked, then Germany will rise up to resist, so that the world will know that the German nation is the strongest nation in the world. The reason why Germans want peace is to love peace together, and the reason why they adhere to their own honor is that Germans cannot live without honor. Germany's past history has been a history of fighting for its own survival, and it will still be a struggle for its own survival in the future. Only this point will be more convenient than in the past because domestic unity has been completed. (National Electric dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<h3>Litvinov Continues Talks with Eden</h3>
<p>London: Soviet People's Foreign Commissar Litvinov, after having a luncheon with Foreign Secretary Eden, meeting King Edward VIII, and visiting Prime Minister Baldwin, visited Foreign Secretary Eden again this afternoon and had dinner with Sir Westacott. (Havas dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<h3>Former Greek Regent Kondylis Passes Away; Sudden Stroke Ineffective Treatment; Great Contribution to Successful Restoration</h3>
<p>Athens: Former Regent General Kondylis, the leader of the far-right National Radical Party, suddenly suffered a stroke while talking with Moghoulis, a member of the Chamber of Deputies, this morning. The treatment was ineffective, and he passed away at 11:00 AM. King George II heard the news and immediately issued an edict of condolence. General Kondylis originally belonged to the Republican Party. In March last year, the party leader, former Prime Minister Venizelos, launched a revolutionary movement. At that time, Kondylis was the Minister of the Army and immediately broke away from the Republican Party and led troops to quell the rebellion. The cabinet was reorganized on April 6, and the leader of the People's Party, Tsaldaris, was appointed as the Prime Minister, and Kondylis served as the Deputy Prime Minister and still held the post of Army Chief. On the issue of the state system, he advocated that the restoration should be announced without a referendum. This was in stark contrast to the views of former Prime Minister Tsaldaris. He suddenly demanded that the restoration be announced immediately and supported Kondylis to form a cabinet. The Tsaldaris cabinet then submitted its resignation, and Kondylis formed a new cabinet to administer the government, awaiting King George's return from England. At the beginning of December, when the king returned to the throne, he intended to issue a general amnesty order, and all those who had been sentenced for participating in the March revolutionary movement were to be pardoned. Kondylis opposed it in vain and finally resigned. The king then ordered Dionysios, a professor at the University of Athens, to organize a transitional cabinet and decided to hold elections for the Chamber of Deputies on the 26th of this month to restore the constitutional system. Kondylis then joined forces with former Minister of Agriculture Theotokis to form a mixed party to participate in the election. As a result, they won 63 seats out of 300 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, which was only a few days ago. (Havas dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<p>Brief Biography of Kondylis: Athens: Former Greek Prime Minister Kondylis died suddenly here today from a heart attack. In 1939, when Kondylis was the Army Chief, he put down the rebellion of the Venizelos Party, established a dictatorship, and later welcomed King George II back to the country and restored the monarchy. However, due to the amnesty of political affairs, he had differing opinions with the King of Greece and was dismissed from the post of Prime Minister. Kondylis was born in 1879, from a poor background. He first studied at the Athens Sports School, and then entered the Athens Army Academy. In 1897, he participated in the Greek-Turkish War. In 1912, he participated in the Balkan Campaign. In 1917, he was promoted to the rank of Major and followed the army to Russia. In 1920, Venizelos's election failed, and Kondylis took refuge in Constantinople. He returned two years later. Because of his bravery, he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. In 1926, Kondylis overthrew Pangalos and became the Prime Minister, but he did not last long and left office due to elections. In 1932, Kondylis broke away from the Venizelos Party and joined the People's Party and decided to serve as the Army Chief. In March 1935, after putting down the Venizelos Party, he returned to Beijing from Macedonia and was very welcomed by the people of Athens. Then a general election was held, and the issue of the Greek restoration arose. Although the royalist party failed in the election, there were still many restorationists in the government. Kondylis then announced a national referendum in the name of acting Prime Minister and Minister of the Army to resolve this issue. Kondylis had no wife. In his spare time, he often read biographies of Alexander the Great and Napoleon. He also sometimes used card games to pass the time. He began to learn French in middle age, but he could not speak it fluently. (Reuters dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<h3>Egypt Participates in Sanctions; Italy Protests; Non-League of Nations Member States Should Not Do This; Retains Right to Claim Compensation for Losses</h3>
<p>Cairo: The Egyptian government has received a protest note from the Italian government, stating that since Egypt is not a member of the League of Nations, it should not participate in the sanctions case. The protest note also stated that the Egyptian government should bear full responsibility, and the Italian government reserves the right to claim compensation for the losses suffered by the Italian people as a result. (National Electric dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<p>Geneva: The Cairo "Young Egypt" Association sent a memorandum to the Secretariat of the League of Nations. The document implied that Egypt should be added to the League of Nations, and the reason why it has not yet joined is because Britain is preventing it. The powers should not allow Britain to manipulate the League of Nations. If the League of Nations believes that Egyptian culture is not as good as Abyssinia's, it might as well explain it frankly. It must be known that Egypt is a completely independent country, and none of the qualifications for joining the League of Nations are not met. The memorandum also pointed out that Egypt was invited by the League of Nations to participate in the economic sanctions case. Although Egypt has great commercial relations with Italy, it wants to express Egypt's intention to peace and world unity, so it participates in this move regardless of everything. However, Egypt is different from other countries participating in the sanctions, because Egypt has not had the opportunity to participate in discussions in the League of Nations on various issues that are closely related to Egypt. Therefore, the decision to participate in the sanctions only makes Egypt's cultural and commercial relations with Italy hurt and not benefit. (National News Agency dispatch of the 30th)</p>

<h3>Preface to "Supplementary Compilation of the Twenty-Five Histories"</h3>
<p>— Gu Jiegang</p>
<p>"Our China has a five-thousand-year history!" This is a boast often made by our countrymen. If asked where this history lies, they will surely say: Are not the Twenty-Four Histories enough to fill the shelves? Adding the New Yuan History to make twenty-five, is it not even richer? However, the value of history lies not only in the bulk of its volumes, the detail of its narratives, and the system of its judgments, but also in the fact that every word has a source, and that the raw materials on which it is based can be verified, showing people that it must be believed. Although the sources on which the history was based when it was compiled from the Zhao Song Dynasty onwards cannot all be seen today, government documents, local chronicles, and private writings still exist in large numbers, and can still be used to examine their truth. If we go back to the Tang and Five Dynasties, before the rise of printing, direct historical materials have been almost completely lost, although there are still some surviving inscriptions on metal and stone and records of ancient books, but these are too scattered to provide a systematic exploration; those who study history have only the Seventeen Histories as their only resource. The so-called five thousand years of history, the first four thousand years are only this, and this is unavoidable.</p>
<p>That scholars of Chinese history cannot abandon the dynastic histories is already the case, and among the dynastic histories, the tables and treatises, which exhaust their task of connecting and synthesizing the evolution of institutions and the changes in personnel, so that readers have a complete understanding of historical phenomena, are the true essence of this resource. The form of the tables and treatises was created by Sima Qian, although it was also based on some precedents, but it was the first time that it was used to complement the biographies to form the outline of the whole book. The function of the tables is not only to run horizontally and obliquely upwards, but also to draw out the mysteries and summarize the essentials; the function of the treatises is not only to arrange the stories neatly, but also to trace the origin and end. The succession of human affairs should not be divided by dynasties, so it is not appropriate to have a history for each dynasty; but historians of ancient and modern times, even if they think they have created a work of their own, are actually seen by readers as works that are connected and inherited. (Zheng Qiao deeply criticized the history of successive dynasties, so he made a general history to change its form, but no one reads the general history today, because its materials cannot go beyond those of its predecessors, and also because the world regards the collection of various dynastic histories as a general history.) If a history is lacking in tables and treatises, then what the reader's eyes touch is only a collection of stories floating in front of them, without any way to grasp the outline, and the succession of human affairs is also cut off!</p>
<p>Not all dynastic histories have tables and treatises. Among the Twenty-Five Histories, only the Records of the Grand Historian (called "Book" instead of "Treatise"), the History of the Han Dynasty, the New Book of Tang, the History of the Song Dynasty, the History of the Liao Dynasty, the History of the Jin Dynasty, the History of the Yuan Dynasty, the New History of the Yuan Dynasty, and the History of the Ming Dynasty have complete tables and treatises; those with treatises but no tables include the History of the Later Han Dynasty, the History of the Jin Dynasty, the History of the Song Dynasty, the History of the Southern Qi Dynasty, the History of the Wei Dynasty, the History of the Sui Dynasty, the Old History of the Five Dynasties, and the New History of the Five Dynasties (called "Examination" instead of "Treatise"). The remaining seven, including the Records of the Three Kingdoms, the History of the Liang Dynasty, the History of the Chen Dynasty, the History of the Northern Qi Dynasty, the History of the Northern Zhou Dynasty, the History of the Southern Dynasties, and the History of the Northern Dynasties, do not have either tables or treatises. These seven kinds without tables and treatises and the nine kinds with treatises but no tables cannot be called perfect, needless to say; even if we look at those with tables and treatises, the authors' knowledge and the materials they took are not without flaws. Therefore, if we say that "the Twenty-Five Histories have many shortcomings," this is indeed a fair comment, and it is not our intention to despise the ancients.</p>
<p>Many scholars, ancient and modern, have felt this kind of defect; in order to remedy it, they have risen up to take on the work of supplementing and correcting. Where the former history has something that the latter history does not, then the latter history is supplemented, such as the supplementary tables of Wan Sitong, Qian Dazhao, and Hong Yisun; where the latter history has something that the former history does not, then the former history is supplemented, such as the supplementary military treatises of Qian Wenzi and Qian Yiji. (It is true that the military treatises supplemented by the two Qians cannot be connected to the two Tangs, but they actually use the style of later historical books.) As for those who connect the past and the present and stand on their own, such as Liang Yusheng's table of ancient and modern people and Zhang Zongyuan and Yao Zhenzong's treatise on the classics of the Sui Dynasty, their aim is to smelt several generations into one furnace, and not just rely on one history. This is the first thing that is valuable about integrating the facts of various histories. Among the tables and treatises of various histories, omissions and contradictions are everywhere. Omissions should be supplemented, and contradictions should be corrected. Wu Zhuoxin's work on the Geography Treatise of the History of the Han Dynasty and Wen Yuejian's work on the Topography Treatise of the History of the Wei Dynasty are so deep that they surpass the former sages. This is the second thing that is valuable about being a friend of the ancients. As for the work of collating, although the technique is subtle, its effect is obvious. If this is done carefully, the book can be read, and this is also a work that should not be abandoned.</p>
<p>The shortcomings of the dynastic histories have been remedied by the efforts of scholars, ancient and modern, and later generations can make use of the existing achievements to make further explorations. But where can we get these existing achievements? I remember ten years ago, Jiegang was studying bibliography and marveled at the various histories, thinking that the Qing people had exhausted the nets of historical research. Later, he liked to collect bibliographies and knew that there were still many such books that had not been published. When he studied in Beiping, many of his teachers and friends studied history, and he saw more precious books and regretted that they could not be collected into one compilation. He privately thought that after Xuehai there was Nan Jing, and wondered if there would be any successors to the work of Guangya? Looking around the world, I was really worried. This spring, when I passed through Shanghai, I saw the catalog of the Supplementary Compilation of the Twenty-Five Histories at the Kaiming Bookstore, and I knew that my old friend Mr. Wang Boxiang (Zhongqi) was in charge of this project, so that it could be published alongside the abridged Twenty-Five Histories, so that readers could compare and verify them with each other, and there would be no more worries about the omissions and contradictions in the original book. The breadth of the collection far exceeds that of Guangya, and almost everything that the world can get is prepared. I am so happy that I cannot sleep. To plan for the full use of the works of the ancients, to open up the door for later scholars, and to relieve the pain of materials not being concentrated, this is truly immeasurable merit, which should be praised by the historical community forever.</p>
<p>The supplementary compilation originally collected more than 170 kinds; later, it invited like-minded friends to search everywhere, and it actually got more than 240 kinds. The sincerity of perseverance makes people admire. Among these more than 100 kinds, there are more than 180 kinds that have old printed editions, and more than 60 kinds that are only preserved in manuscripts. The books of Wan Sitong and Wang Shiduo, which have been buried for a long time, are revealed by this, which can be said to be a great joy in the historical circle in recent years. It is the Kaiming Bookstore that has made our generation's eyes proud of our predecessors!</p>
<p>The publication of this book is not enough for the bookstore to take this action, but it must have something to say to the hard work of scholars, ancient and modern, for academic work, and then it can be worthy of it. What is the way? Without considering my own shortcomings, I will explain it in detail. In the past, those who supplemented the tables were mostly officials, and those who supplemented the treatises were mostly geography, art, and literature. The authors took advantage of the convenience of materials and took the lead in this, which is what they should do. But we were born today, we have new problems, and we have new needs. We should pay more attention to and supplement the aspects of ethnicity, society, and religion, one thing. Since the Song Dynasty, historians have mostly studied Zen-minded history, and the works on supplementing and correcting the tables and treatises of the History of the Han Dynasty have become the richest. This is a satisfactory achievement in terms of the work of the scholars themselves, but from the perspective of the entire historical community, it is quite contrary to the principle of detailing the near and omitting the distant. In the future, we should always pay attention to the recent and ancient histories, so that after decades, when bookstores continue to edit, there will still be regrets that the materials are not balanced, another thing. The closer the historical materials are, the more abundant they are, and the closer their relationship with human affairs is. Although the supplementary compilation is mostly limited to the Twenty-Five Histories, our work should not be limited by this. It is said that the Draft History of the Qing Dynasty will be unbanned, and its treatises such as art and literature, diplomacy, and food and goods can be supplemented and revised everywhere. Because of the proximity of today to the Qing Dynasty, and the large number of direct historical materials preserved, it is not allowed for scholars of other generations to take on the task of mining copper from the mountains.</p>
<p>Some people may say: If it is really about mining copper, then the work of the predecessors is wrong. They did not have new materials and only extracted records from the old history. Although this supplementary book has hundreds of millions of words, its materials have never gone beyond the old history. What is the value of this superfluous move? I answer: It cannot be said to be so! What is valuable about scholars is their ability to make full use of things. Sima Qian wrote eight books and ten tables, and fifteen or sixteen of the materials he saw were in the biographies. What did he do this for? He also said that he used the strictness of the tables and treatises to remedy the disorder of the biographies and to make full use of the historical books. Did I not say before that the tables and treatises are the outline of the biographies? How can those who make the outline wait for new materials? They can be carefully selected. Today, who does not know that the Twenty-Five Histories are the place where Chinese historical facts are collected, but how many people can use them? To establish a topic, they do not know where the materials are. Although they have the things, they cannot see them, which is the harm of not having an outline. If so, then it is like having history without history. If we can really organize the old materials, so that things have no way to hide and people can use them at will, the benefits must not be less than discovering new materials. Moreover, the Qing people's style of extensive knowledge has been used to prove the old books with new materials, so those who supplement the table of officials have seals and mud seals, and those who supplement the genealogy table have inscriptions and epitaphs. How can it be said that it does not go beyond the old historical books! The earth does not hide treasures, and ancient objects come out every day. We were born today, and we can only supplement them at any time, so that nothing loses its place. The work of the predecessors can be corrected but not criticized.</p>
<p>The call for a "General History of China" has been heard for a long time, but the book has not yet come out. This is not the fault of today's historians, but because their reliance is not deep enough. Those who are engaged in this work, if they do not have a deep understanding and foresight of historical facts, and do not make extensive searches and discriminations of materials, then the completion of their book will be no different from school textbooks. If we have the ambition to do this, we must think about how to make the most of the Twenty-Five Histories and this supplementary compilation, and eliminate what is not needed, so that there is no word of waste, and for the materials that were previously excluded from the scope of history and the newly discovered materials underground, we will compare and judge them with new methods and judge them with new eyes, so that they can be integrated with the surviving parts of the old historical books. We will advance on separate paths, persevering without giving up. After decades, we will surely create a different kind of history for Chinese historiography, and the emergence of a general history will be within reach. On the day of the publication of this supplementary compilation, I am happy that the foundation has been laid, and I dare to hold the ticket and wait for it!</p>

<h3>"Willow Wind"</h3>
<p>— Zhou Zuoren</p>
<p>Every time I receive your handwriting, I think of the preface to the translation of "The Wind in the Willows," and I feel that this cannot be delayed any longer, and that I should hurry up and write it. But every time I think about it, I immediately put it down. Why? First, I always want to wait until the last day of the deadline to write a small preface, and the news of the publication of this book is unexpected, so it seems that I can still be lazy for a few days. First,——I really can't write it. I thought about it for a while and had to put down my pen. But the other day, when I received the presence of your wife to urge me in person, and I received a letter saying that the book was about to be printed, I felt that I really had to write it. But how to write it?</p>
<p>Five years ago, I wrote a small article introducing "The Wind in the Willows" on the Camel Grass, which was later included in the Watching Clouds Collection. I have written almost everything I wanted to say there, and I still don't have any new ideas to say. I took out the Shepard illustrated edition of "The Wind in the Willows" that I have, and the Chalmers' biography of Grahame that my brother lent me, and flipped through them for a while, but it was irrelevant. Although I had the materials, I didn't have the meaning I wanted to write. Zhuangzi said: "The sun and the moon have come out, but the torch does not go out. Is its light not too weak?" The complete translation of "The Wind in the Willows" has already come out, and the translation is so fluent that people can just go directly to enjoy it. What is there to say here? It is like raising a finger after the Buddha Kuti preached the Dharma. It would not be a good luck this year if he were not driven out with a stick.</p>
<p>Here I just want to say a word, which is about the mole. According to legend, the original name of this book was "The Wind in the Reeds," and it was later changed to its current name. It was published in 1908. Chapter Seven, "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn," seems to be its central part, but as I said before, it is written very beautifully, but it is also a bit too mysterious, and I don't have much affinity for it. Another title of his is "The Mole and his Companions," which I like very much. Milne's script is called Mr. Toad of Toad Hall. I suspect that this is because of the play, so he invited the toad to be the speaker. If we look at the whole book, the most interesting one is probably Mr. Mole. Milne said in his preface:</p>
<p>"Sometimes we should think of him as a real mole, sometimes as wearing human clothes, sometimes as big as a man, sometimes as walking on two legs, sometimes as walking on four legs. He is a mole, he is not a mole. What is he? I don't know. And, because he's not a real person, I don't care." This is well said. This not only shows his understanding of moles, but also his love for them. We can love moles in the same way, but understanding is a little more difficult, and it is difficult to love without understanding. We can certainly think of him as not being a mole like Milne, but we must first know what a mole is before we can think of him as not being one. So what is a mole? According to the original text, Mole, the Oxford Concise Dictionary notes:</p>
<p>"A small animal that lives in the ground, with dark, velvety fur and very small eyes." In Chinese, it is commonly called a mole, but it does not seem to be the same as the one that drinks the river to its full capacity. The Compendium of Materia Medica, Volume 51, lists the sayings of various families:</p>
<p>"Hong Jing said, this is the mole, also known as the hidden mouse, shaped like a mouse but large, tailless, black, with a very strong pointed nose, often walking in the ground, and can be obtained by digging.</p>
<p>"Cang Qi said, the hidden mouse walks in the ground in the dark, and dies when it sees the light of the sun and the moon. It is found in the soil under deep mountains and forests.</p>
<p>"Zong Xuan said, the mole's feet are extremely short, and it can only walk. Its tail is about an inch long, and its neck is especially short. It is the easiest to catch, or it can be shot with a bamboo bow to feed the hawk.</p>
<p>"Shi Zhen said, the field mouse crawls in the ground and can mound the soil into mounds, so it gets its name." Terajima Ryoan's Illustrated Sino-Japanese Encyclopedia, Volume 35, quotes the Compendium after it:</p>
<p>"According to the case, the monster looks like a fat mouse, with reddish-brown fur, a short neck like a wild boar, a hard white nose, five or six minutes long, and a short lower beak. Its eyes have no sockets, its ears have no earlobes but are clever, its hands dig the soil, it uses its nose to move, and then returns to the old road. It sometimes eats earthworms, causing the pillars to tilt and the roots of trees to wither. When it hears human voices, it runs away. In the early morning, spy on the place where it is digging, dig it open from behind, and chase it from the front. Then it will be forced to go out, and it will not dare to move when it sees the sunlight, and it will die." This says the most completely. The situation of the mole, this little mouse, can probably be understood. In this way, we can also generate interest in "Mr. Mole" and welcome him out. But unfortunately, we usually lack intimacy with him. Although Weimondo's Hundred Beasts Illustrated, item 28, says, "Ordinary field mice are found all over the world," in fact, everyone rarely sees him. Whether young or old, when you mention moles, moles, hidden mice, field mice, or the elegant name of earth dragon, I am afraid that you will inevitably be a little confused. In short, they do not have the feeling that British people have when they hear "mole," or Japanese people have when they hear "mogura." In English, a mole cricket is called a molericket (mole cricket). If Chinese people should call a mole a mole cricket, we should use the example of familiar things to describe unfamiliar things. Many of those names are really only active in books. The name earth dragon may be a common name, but I don't understand it. The name field mouse was once adopted in the first draft of the translation, which seems to be the most appropriate, but I am afraid that it will be confused with real field mice. In the original book, there is also "field mouse" appearing, so I had to use the name mole. This term was mostly determined by Westerners. I remember that there are several kinds of moles in the Illustrated Explanation of Hundred Beasts, but they are other kinds of mice. In what book did he translate it as "mole?" I can't remember clearly. When Eroshinko's Pink Clouds was published, moles became known to the world, but this was only a translation of "mogura." The current translation also inherits this system. Its advantage is that it is a new term, and it also has some expressiveness. The words on the surface can also slightly express its characteristics. But of course, there are also shortcomings. This shows that the Chinese Mandarin, that is, people, lack close contact with "nature," and are so indifferent to such an interesting ordinary small animal, that they have not given it a good name that can be used in Mandarin articles. It cannot be said that this is a great dishonor. When people tell children stories about moles, "Little Mouse" (the original author's son's nickname) listens happily and goes to sleep quietly. We and the mole are so unfamiliar that we have to study his name and role before listening to the story. In that case, how much fun is there to be had in listening to the story? This is what I cannot help but think about with disappointment.</p>
<p>My brother asked me to write a small preface, but I talked a lot about moles. This is exactly writing without sticking to the topic. Since I can't write an article that sticks to the topic, then it's good to not stick to the topic. Confucius discussed poetry and said that it can be used to express excitement, observe customs, make friends, and express resentment. I don't know if "The Wind in the Willows" can be used to express excitement, observe customs, make friends, and express resentment. Even if it can, that's not what I'm thinking about. As for its plants and birds and animals, I like them very much. Some people want to guide children to find lessons in the wind in the willows, or that may be the right way. I never agree with a word, but my intention is to hope that they will go and play with the toads and water rats during their military training and examination preparation. Therefore, I talk a little about moles without bothering to write elegant words. If so, although my article does not conform to the rules, it is still within my own topic.</p>

<h3>Heredity, Environment, Education: Reading "The Kallikak Family"</h3>
<p>— Xue Hongda, written by Dr. H.H. Goddard, translated by Huang Suifeng and Lin Jienang</p>
<p>Published by Kaiming Bookstore, priced at six cents</p>
<p>Eugenics, which applies the results of hereditary psychology research to improve the human race, has not yet aroused enthusiastic attention in academic circles in China. A few years ago, Mr. Pan Guangdan and Mr. Zhou Jianren had a discussion on eugenics. We were able to read the opinions of Mr. Pan and Mr. Zhou in the Collection of Essays on Human Biology (published by Xinyue Bookstore); but since then, we have not seen such a meaningful discussion. Even if there is, it is only a few necessary "Introduction to Eugenics" that can be seen in textbooks. But I think the eugenics problem is indeed worthy of our research, because if the race can achieve the purpose of eugenics, all the dark secrets, meanness, and filth in society will naturally disappear, and the peace and happiness of people's lives can be obtained. In other words, national rejuvenation, cultural progress, and world harmony can gradually be expected to be realized because there are no mentally deficient and bad elements in the world?</p>
<p>I haven't read books on eugenics for a long time. Recently, I read "The Kallikak Family," jointly translated by Mr. Huang Zifeng and Ms. Lin Jienang, and I think it is very worthwhile to introduce it to modern youth, especially youth who are willing to bear the heavy responsibility of improving society.</p>
<p>This book does not only talk about scientific theories, but uses a relaxed and interesting style to record Dr. Goddard's investigative work that has made great contributions to the academic world. When Dr. Goddard was the director of the laboratory for mentally deficient children attached to the Training School for Feeble-Minded Children in Vineland City, USA, he took in a illegitimate girl named Deborah Kallikak. After 14 years of rigorous training, this stupid, mentally deficient woman, who was already in her twenties, still could not be made to have more wisdom than an ordinary ten-year-old child at school. In order to explore whether the girl's mental deficiency was due to the heredity of her ancestors, Dr. Goddard began to investigate the situation of her family and the character of her grandfather, and the result was a report that was unexpected by everyone. The girl's maternal grandfather, Martin Kallikak, was a member of a prominent family who participated in the American Revolutionary War. While in the army, he had a confused marriage with an unnamed, idiotic girl and had a son named Martin Jr. Later, Martin Jr.'s descendants reproduced a lot. According to Dr. Goddard's investigation, there were a total of 480 people, but more than 90% of these people were either idiots, drunkards, criminals, prostitutes, or had short lifespans. Deborah Kallikak was a direct descendant of Martin Jr. Coincidentally, there was another excellent family line for comparison with this thoroughly bad family line, which was also a descendant of Martin Kallikak. It turned out that after Martin retired from the army in peace, he returned home and married a healthy woman. Among their 496 descendants, most of them were doctors, judges, lawyers, teachers, and landlords who were excellent in character and learning. The children born to Martin and the healthy woman were all healthy, and the children born to him and the mentally deficient woman were a group of social outcasts who were not as good as pigs and dogs. From the relationship between this "good and evil family," we can get the following inspiration.</p>
<p>1.  The possibility of heredity will never be changed by the accidental changes of the environment, and what can be changed is only the degree of development. (Page 173 of this book)</p>
<p>2.  Improving the environment and education can only improve those who have already been formed, so that their hereditary nature can be fully developed. And improving the bloodline can develop the future race. (Page 173)</p>
<p>From this point of view, if we want to make the race excellent, we must stop the reproduction of the mentally deficient, so as not to pass on their inferiority to future generations, so that neither the race nor the society will benefit. This is the proposition of eugenicists. However, because of "humanitarianism," "social customs," and "the degree of testing of the mentally deficient is not yet precise," the implementation of "eugenics" is still impossible even in countries such as Britain and the United States, and it still needs to wait for the further efforts of mankind. Since it is difficult to prevent all the mentally deficient people in society from giving birth, from a passive point of view, young people should carefully choose their spouses. Ms. Lin said well:——</p>
<p>"Smart marriage is not about men marrying beautiful women, or women choosing husbands with money. What I mean is that when men marry women, they should pay attention to whether her character is noble and pure, whether her ability is independent and strong, and whether her body is healthy and strong. Secondly, they should see whether their thoughts can be harmonious, and then visit her parents and ancestors to see whether they are clean, healthy, and free from disease. Women should also choose husbands in this way, and don't be blind..."</p>
<p>If young men and women can pay attention to this when looking for a lifelong partner, then there will be endless benefits for themselves and their future descendants. In addition, there is a paragraph on page 112 of this book that is even more straightforward and can be used as an inscription for some modern youth.</p>
<p>"...Young friends with clean families, a single slip can cause eternal regret, and it is already a hundred years to turn back. The reproductive organs can be used well to get good results, and they can be used indiscriminately to get bad results. Their merits cannot compensate for their faults. Young, clean friends, don't go whoring because of a moment's impulse, or seduce inferior women! Female friends, please don't only covet the wealth and honor of mentally deficient men, and let them trample and ruin your pure bodies!"</p>
<h3>Mr. Feng Zikai: Impressions and Bibliography</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Shi Jiao</p>
<p>A brownish-yellow face, with humble, sincere, and serious eyes, sporting an unkempt mustache; a dark-colored long robe and a felt hat; speaking in a very straightforward and gentle manner: such an elderly man often appears in my memories. This is my teacher from eight years ago, Mr. Feng Zikai.</p>
<p>Speaking of the old gentleman, everyone probably thinks of his cartoons. The paintings composed of sparse lines often attract your attention; this is his artistic skill. His cartoons mostly originated from a self-made "sketchbook," which was a very simple booklet; it was just a stack of white paper with a soft cloth cover, tied with a string. He often kept it in his pocket, taking it out and using it whenever inspiration arose from within or impressions poured in from the outside world.</p>
<p>His cartoon style has changed from a humorous, dreamlike, and poetic state to a reality full of thorns, leaving obvious traces. When the first collection of Zikai's cartoons was published, the subject matter and style were as delicate and lovely as new willows in spring, giving readers a more comfortable and relaxing feeling than a beautiful dream. At the time, criticisms of this collection, besides a majority of admirers, naturally included some who disagreed, saying that he was hiding in his ivory tower, pursuing his own beautiful dreams. By the time the second collection of Zikai's paintings was published, it clearly contained some descriptions of real life. Many of the cartoons about children's lives subtly expressed the contradiction between innocent thoughts and reality, which was particularly well-received. This may have been the motivation for his later continuous publication of children's cartoons and cartoons about children's lives. When the "Protecting Life" collection and student cartoons were published, his gentle, poetic style suddenly changed to a deep satire of corruption. This change in style once aroused much criticism and encouragement in literary circles, making his tendency to turn towards practical aspects more resolute. From the most recent publication, "Human Affairs," we can see this result.</p>
<p>In "Human Affairs," his brush has deeply penetrated the depths of society. He exposes all kinds of human evils and stabs at the heart of contradictions, boldly revealing all the inequalities of human life. His subject matter and expressive methods can be said to be both firm and gentle, making people not know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>In addition to cartoons, Mr. Feng's essays are also very popular with readers. He often uses subtle subjects to lead to many serious problems; seeing the world in a grain of sand is the commentary on his works. The writing is exceptionally light and lively, without any dryness, obscurity, or overly subtle, incomprehensible problems. He likes to look at everything in the world with the eyes of a painter; so sometimes a beggar becomes a beauty; flowers grown in a vase can turn into crying faces. These images are often wonderfully depicted. He is a very cultivated artist, so his writing not only has carefully observed images but is also often written vividly.</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>New Posture of China's Economy</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>People from neighboring countries engaged in propaganda in Europe and the United States have often said that China is an unorganized country. If we take the previous economic state of our country as an example, then we have no way to defend ourselves. Our country's economic system has always been known as backward. On the surface, it is scattered and chaotic, but in secret, it is controlled by a small number of old forces. The representatives of these forces are divided into factions and squeeze each other, all seeking only private interests and disregarding the welfare of society and the country. Not only do the majority of the people suffer from the exploitation of this small number of special classes, but even the government has to be restrained and manipulated by them. However, now the situation has greatly changed. Due to the success of the two major policies of public bonds and currency reform, the government has achieved the effect of controlling the economy. The typical economic posture of a modern country can be said to have been formed.</p>
<p>If a modern country wants to make overall plans for the national economy and the people's livelihood, it is necessary to implement a controlled economy. Whether this system is truly beneficial to the people should be based on the premise that the government is our people's government, but this is another issue. The government is fully responsible for the national economy and the people's livelihood. It is more reasonable for the social economy to be controlled by the government than to be manipulated by a small number of selfish people.</p>
<p>The implementation of a controlled economy will inevitably sacrifice a small number of old forces. Various reforms in finance accompanying the controlled economy will inevitably cause resistance from a small number of people. At the beginning of the currency reform, some people in the country were skeptical and critical, but after implementation, the legal currency was highly credible and foreign exchange was also stable. In December of last year, the national foreign trade surplus exceeded 5 million, presenting a good phenomenon only seen since 1928. The effectiveness of this financial reform has been proven in fact.</p>
<p>The recent major fluctuations in the price of the public bond market have once again aroused suspicion among some people about the financial authorities. This can also be said to be a kind of reaction in the process of promoting a controlled economy. However, after the rumors occurred, the Ministry of Finance immediately ordered the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Stock Exchange that all public bond transactions in January must be submitted in actual goods and not deferred. It also appointed members of the ministry to go to the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to jointly inspect and seal the bonds and funds stored and prepared by each bank under the item of receiving bond issuance preparations. Without the permission of the ministry, it is not allowed to transfer them privately. On the one hand, this is enough to show fairness and dispel rumors. On the other hand, it can also suppress the frenzy of public bond speculation so that private floating capital will not be wasted on the buying and selling of public bond speculation but will change direction to become capital for industry and commerce. This is truly a wise measure by the government to adapt to the situation.</p>
<h3>More Than 30 Japanese and Manchukuo Soldiers Clash with Soviet Russian Defense Forces; Both Sides Open Fire and Engage in Hand-to-Hand Combat; Japanese and Manchukuo Troops are Defeated; Soviet Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Lodges a Serious Protest with the Japanese Ambassador</h3>
<p>Moscow, via Baili: On the 30th, in the daytime, a Soviet border patrol in the Soviet territory of Grodkovo, three kilometers from the border, caught sight of four plainclothes Japanese and Manchukuo soldiers. When they tried to arrest them, they opened fire. At that time, 30 armed Japanese and Manchukuo soldiers appeared and also opened fire. At the beginning of the exchange of fire, 25 guards from the Soviet border battalion arrived to reinforce them, and finally drove the Japanese and Manchukuo troops who had invaded Soviet territory back across the border. At the same time, the Japanese and Manchukuo troops continued to send reinforcements, so their total number must have been more than a company. During the exchange of fire, there were hand-to-hand combats. As a result, the Japanese and Manchukuo troops were forced to retreat into Manchukuo territory. (TASS dispatch on the 31st)</p>

<h3>League of Nations Issues Notice Calling for International Conference to Discuss Convention on Punishing Drug Trafficking</h3>
<p>Geneva: The Secretary of the League of Nations recently issued a notice to all countries, calling for an international conference to be held in Geneva on June 8 this year to discuss how to formulate an international convention on punishing illegal trafficking in narcotics in accordance with the resolutions of the Executive Yuan on May 22, 1935, and January 20, 1936. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>Geneva: The US government recently sent a report on opium trafficking in 1934 to the Secretariat of the League of Nations, explaining that illegal drug traffickers are increasingly obtaining cooked opium, morphine, heroin, and cocaine from the Far East, and using Central American countries and the West Indies as bases to secretly transport them into the United States. Each shipment is generally less than it was three years ago. In total, in 1934, 158 illegal incidents (referring to the trafficking or use of narcotics) occurred in the United States, 50 cases were prosecuted, and 33 cases were found to be true and were sentenced separately. Twelve cases were dismissed, and fines totaled $6,651. Twenty-seven ships involved in smuggling narcotics were seized, with a total fine of $135,518. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)</p>

<h3>Naval Conference Technical Group Drafts Proposal on Ship Construction Notification; Submitted to the General Committee for Discussion Yesterday; Qualitative Restrictions: US, France, and Italy Have Different Views</h3>
<p>London: The naval conference is scheduled to meet at 3:30 pm today to discuss the draft proposal on advance notification of ship construction passed by the technical committee yesterday. According to this draft proposal, the general details of the ship construction process must be stated in the notification, and the specific details of each ship must be reported one by one when the keel is laid and construction begins. (Reuters dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>London: The General Committee of the Naval Conference, which appointed a technical sub-committee on the 17th of this month to draft an agreement on the method of exchanging information on ship construction procedures, completed the draft this afternoon and will submit it to the General Committee for discussion at 3 pm tomorrow. The main points of this draft are as follows: The ship construction procedures of each naval power shall be announced in the first four months of each year. Ship construction procedures shall be implemented only four months after notifying other countries. If, after announcing the ship construction procedures, any changes are made to the established procedures within these four months, or if any country raises opinions on the ship construction procedures of other countries, then the signatory countries may consult with each other through diplomatic channels. However, consultation is at the discretion of each country and is not mandatory. Each time a new ship is started, each country shall also be notified. The information to be notified in advance of ship construction procedures includes not only the various information stipulated in the Washington Treaty, (i.e., the number, tonnage, and gun caliber of battleships and aircraft carriers), but also the number of aircraft that can be carried on the aircraft carrier, or the area of the aircraft carrier's flight deck, or the aircraft carrier's equipment for launching aircraft, shall also be included in the notification. The General Committee of the Naval Conference is currently discussing the issue of qualitative restrictions. If the result is to classify Class B cruisers and torpedo boats as light warships, then the type of each ship shall be clearly stated when notifying ship construction procedures. If this draft agreement is passed by the General Committee, it will not be signed temporarily until an agreement is reached on the issue of qualitative restrictions. Then the two cases will be merged to draft a complete naval treaty. The current difficulty with the issue of qualitative restrictions is that the United States advocates a battleship tonnage of 35,000 tons and a gun caliber of 16 inches, while France and Italy advocate a tonnage of 27,000 tons for this type of ship and a gun caliber reduced to 12 inches.

<h3>Japanese Navy Adopts a "Combat First" Principle; Combined Fleet to Conduct Three-Dimensional Warfare Exercises Next Month</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese Imperial Combined Fleet, after deciding to withdraw from the London naval disarmament conference, is actively adopting a "people and ships first" principle of combat readiness. It is scheduled to gather more than 60 large and small warships, with the battleship Nagato as the flagship, in Saeki Bay, Oita Prefecture, on February 5. After inspections and instructions by Commander-in-Chief Takahashi, the First Fleet will depart Saeki Bay on the 10th and the Second Fleet will depart from the 6th to the 21st, heading to Sukumo. On the 25th, they will cruise in Beppu, and finally, with the Bungo Channel as the center, they will unfold a magnificent three-dimensional naval-air battle along the upper and lower Kyushu coast, focusing on emergency sea control. Around April, the two fleets will enter Sasebo Naval Port, where the sailors will rest and study. After replenishment at the end of May, they will be temporarily disbanded and will begin the second phase of training from June. (China United Press dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota Considers Trade Diplomacy with Britain to Cope with the Situation After the Breakdown of the Naval Conference</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Minister Hirota, in order to cope with diplomacy with Britain after the breakdown of the disarmament conference, summoned Ambassador Matsudaira and Trade Bureau Director Kuru to the first consultation meeting on the 30th to discuss adjusting trade issues between Japan and Britain. The fundamental policy of Japan's trade diplomacy was already explained by Foreign Minister Hirota in a parliamentary speech, namely that Japan, based on the principle of free trade in the world, demands that all countries open up markets and resources. Therefore, the policy towards Britain is to demand the abolition of tariff systems that hinder the export of Japanese goods, so that commercial goods from all countries can circulate freely, in order to ensure national survival and eliminate the causes that threaten world peace. The Foreign Minister believes that cooperation between Japan and Britain is a means to maintain world peace, and his trade policy towards Britain is highly valued by all parties.

<h3>The Far East is in Urgent Turmoil; the Philippines Enhances its Defenses; Overseas Chinese Must Also Serve in the Military; Aiming to Resist Japan</h3>
<p>China United Press, Manila: After the establishment of the Philippine Commonwealth Government, in view of the urgency of the Far East situation and the constant threat of aggression from strong enemies, the Philippine President Quezon immediately organized a National Defense Committee and consulted with General MacArthur, the former Chief of Staff of the US Army and current military advisor to the Philippine government, to discuss the plan to train a national defense force. It is planned to allocate 16 million Philippine pesos annually for military expenses. The number of regular troops will be 19,000, of which 8,000 are existing constables, directly under the jurisdiction of the central government. The total number of police officers in all parts of the Philippines is currently 8,698, and they can also be incorporated into the national defense force when necessary. It is also planned to implement a conscription system. All residents of the Philippines, regardless of nationality (excluding personnel of foreign consulates in the Philippines), who are 21 years of age or older, must undergo five and a half months of military training. Therefore, overseas Chinese in the Philippines must also serve in the Philippine military. It is estimated that ten years after independence from the United States, the Philippines will have 500,000 militiamen. The Philippines currently has 8,000 constables, which cost about 8 million pesos per year. Therefore, implementing the above-mentioned national defense plan will only require an additional allocation of 8 to 9 million pesos, which should not be too difficult. Moreover, the Philippine government's treasury currently has a reserve of more than 75 million pesos. In case the regular expenses are insufficient, it is not difficult to allocate some of the reserved funds to make up for it. Furthermore, Quezon's Philippine military defense plan is entirely based on resisting Japanese military aggression as the hypothetical enemy. Although its national defense strength may not be as strong as Japan's, it can at least defend against enemy invasion. There are also plans to establish military factories in the Philippines to manufacture military supplies. The Philippine government has now ordered that, starting from January 1 of each year after the first year of the Philippine Commonwealth Government, all residents of the Philippines who are 21 years of age must register in preparation for receiving military training.</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Defense Committee Considers Strengthening Military Preparations; Sets Minimum Numbers</h3>
<p>London: The Cabinet Defense Committee met again this afternoon. This is the seventh meeting in the past three weeks. It is generally believed that the numbers of military equipment to be increased proposed by the Defense Committee will be opposed by Congress, or may be required to be reduced. Therefore, the committee has been meeting for days in order to set the minimum numbers, so that they can be accepted when Congress requires reductions. In addition, judging from the discussion of the naval conference, the tonnage of battleships seems to be maintained at 35,000 tons. Therefore, the British Cabinet plans to build this type of warship, and it is possible that construction will begin this year. If so, the initial cost will be 50,000 pounds, which is not included in the estimated budget and must be raised in advance. It is also heard that the Cabinet will also build one or two aircraft carriers and consider increasing the strength of the air force, the scope of which is wider than last year's plan.</p>
<h3>Egyptian Political Crisis Resolved; New Cabinet Sworn In; Prime Minister Ali Maher Concurrently Serves as Foreign Minister; Anglo-Egyptian Treaty Negotiations to Begin Next Month</h3>
<p>Egyptian Capital: Court Minister Ali Maher, who was ordered to organize a new cabinet, has completed it today and was sworn in before King Fuad. The new Prime Minister told reporters that the parliamentary elections are scheduled to be held on May 2 this year. "We hope that the future of the country will create a peaceful and unified situation, so that we can start treaty negotiations with Britain and complete the mission of the people to demand independent sovereignty. We firmly believe that in order to make future negotiations with Britain successful, the essential condition lies in the concerted efforts of the whole country." (Havas dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>Cairo: The new cabinet organized by Court Minister Maher was announced last night. The Prime Minister will concurrently serve as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and National Party leader Pasha has been appointed as Minister of Finance. The new cabinet will be sworn in this afternoon and will immediately pass a bill to create a special committee dedicated to continuing negotiations with Britain. This special committee will begin work on February 15. The government is now making every effort to prepare the basis for various issues of discussion, so that future discussions with British representatives will have a basis. This committee will be chaired by National Party leader Pasha, and the committee will be composed of six National Party members and five National Front members. (National Telegraph dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>London: Regarding the Anglo-Egyptian treaty issue, according to news from the Egyptian capital, negotiations are scheduled to begin on February 15. Officials here recently stated that the date of the negotiations has not yet been determined, but it should not be far off. As for the content, the military relationship between Britain and Egypt, (i.e., the conclusion of a treaty of alliance) and the issue of British imperial transportation, (with the Suez Canal relationship being the most important) must be discussed first. In addition, there are four other outstanding issues that will be discussed after these two issues have been agreed upon. The so-called four outstanding issues are: The abolition of consular jurisdiction in Egypt; The issue of British participation in Egyptian administration and police; The issue of Egypt joining the League of Nations; The issue of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan governance, or regarding the agreement on this issue, consultations and resolutions must be made after the Egyptian parliamentary elections are completed, so that the actions of the Egyptian government can obtain the support of the entire people of that country.

<h3>South Road Ah Army Reinforcements Arrive; Major Battle Imminent; Outposts Only Twelve Miles from Italian Forces; Field Battles Ongoing in the Danbian Region</h3>
<p>Ah-Jing, Special Correspondent Aochaina Reports: The Ah Country troops in the Wogaden Province on the South Road are currently undergoing large-scale movements. The garrison stationed in Qiqiqa City has already been completely deployed to the south. It is reported that their outposts are only twenty kilometers away from the Italian forces, and a battle is imminent. The Ah army possesses many artillery pieces, and its strength should not be underestimated. As for the Italian and Ah armies in the Danbian area on the North Road, they are still continuing to engage in battle. According to official announcements, on the 20th of this month, an Italian column was attacked by Ah Country General Xialle. Thirty-five Italian soldiers were killed, and five trucks were seized by the Ah army. Furthermore, according to official sources, the Italian fortress of Gulai Beila on the North Road is still occupied by the Ah army as of the 21st of this month. It is said that the Italian and Ah armies in Tigre Province are currently very active. (31st, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: According to news from Ah Country, field battles are still ongoing in the Danbian area of the northern front. Although it is said that the army led by General Xiyongmu has suffered heavy losses in three days of fierce fighting, it is still active. It seems that Xiyongmu's current intention is to avoid direct large-scale engagements, but to launch surprise attacks in various places, making them exhausted. On the southern front, the Ah army is currently reorganizing in order to intercept Italian light infantry units and cut off their transportation when they arrive in the mountainous areas of Balo and Xidamo. It is reported that troops are currently being transferred south from Qiqiqa, and it seems that there will be a major battle within Wogaden. It is also reported that the Ah vanguard is currently only twelve miles away from the Italian battle lines. There are rumors that General Taistai, the commander-in-chief of the Ah army in that area, will soon be replaced by Internal Affairs Minister Malimu, but this has not yet been confirmed. General Taistai is the son-in-law of the Ah Emperor, has been married for thirteen years, is currently in his thirties, and is one of the wealthiest relatives in Ah Country. Last night, Ah-Jing experienced a major thunderstorm with extremely heavy rainfall, unprecedented in many years. It is reported that the main road to Taixi is now blocked due to the rain. (31st, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Ah-Jing: The Ah Country government has begun to take active steps to prevent the advance of the Italian army. Today, three cabinet members departed from Taixi by plane to the Jingji Railway area to prepare reinforcements to support the troops of Ah Emperor's son-in-law, General Dengduo. The three cabinet members are Finance Minister Sairaxi, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Maigusi, and Interior Minister Mailing. At the same time, according to a government announcement, the Ah army on the northern front has occupied the Apeilei Battery, seizing thirteen artillery pieces and twenty-five machine guns. Fierce fighting is currently still ongoing. (30th, National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fascist Party Convenes Supreme Council</h3>
<p>Rome: The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party is scheduled to meet tomorrow night (i.e., February 1st) at 10:00 PM. The previous meeting was held from December 18th to 20th of last year. The term of this meeting was originally scheduled to be held on the 18th of this month, but it was postponed until now to wait for the conclusion of the League of Nations Council meeting. According to the meeting schedule, the League of Nations Council meeting started on the 20th of this month, and the eighteen-nation committee on sanctions issues did not discuss the oil embargo issue. The general atmosphere was very relaxed. Although Italian people felt satisfied, they firmly believed that this environment was only a fleeting moment and that the sanctioning countries would soon resume their activities. Judging from the recent speech made by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, it can be seen that Italy's attitude remains unchanged and it will continue its East African policy at any cost. Italian semi-official newspapers have recently reprinted commentaries written by German newspapers on the Italian-Ah dispute, and added comments, saying that once the oil embargo method is implemented, its nature will have exceeded the economic scope and become a political measure. Italy will never take a passive attitude and will not hesitate to change its European policy if necessary. The unspoken meaning is self-evident. In addition, Italian newspapers also said that the countries participating in the sanctions have different interests and sometimes conflict with each other, which is very beneficial to Italy.

<p>Washington: Leaders of the government party and opposition party in the House of Representatives today had many speculations about the estimate of paying veterans' pensions in President Roosevelt's letter to Speaker Bains yesterday, which required 2,249,785,375 yuan.

Republican leader Smauel said that the funds required for the case should be proposed in the next Congress.

<h3>Tong Salt Inspectorate - Preventing Tax Police from Causing Disturbances</h3>
<p>The Nantong Salt Affairs Audit Office prevents tax police from causing disturbances and implements searches only during the daytime. (31st, Special Dispatch) At present, the mouth is only more than 400 meters wide. The people of Puyang, Fanshou, and Shuyang please do not block the breach. Jinan Communication, League of Nations water conservancy expert Potterie. Highway expert Gu Sang, commissioned by the Economic Commission, came to Shandong to inspect the situation of the flood entering the river from Huanghuasi after the breach of the Juye County People's Levee. He arrived at Taochengbu on the 27th, but could not pass due to the river being frozen. He stayed there that night. After a night of north wind, the ice became more solid and he had to hire twenty or thirty civilians to break the ice. After breakfast on the 28th, Potterie and others went to the river and supervised the civilians they hired to break the ice. From dawn to 12:00, the ice was opened. People and cars crossed the river one after another. Wu Nankai, director of the Engineering Team of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, welcomed them to Yangzha with two foreign engineers and traveled together. According to Wu, the diversion canal of Lisheng Tun East Dam started construction on the 28th. More than 1,000 civilians were at work and more than 20,000 people could arrive on the 28th. It is planned to dig through the diversion canal within 20 days. The team arrived at Huanghuasi at 2:00 PM, got off the car to inspect the situation of the flood entering the river. The water level has risen by 5.5 centimeters in the past four days, and it rose another 4 centimeters on the 28th. Because the terrain outside the Huanghuasi mouth is higher, not much water flows into the old river. The water at the upper section of the breach gradually receded. Houses collapsed, and the victims fled to the embankment, crying for hunger and cold, which was very tragic. At 6:00 PM, they arrived at Duzhuang and got off the car to inspect the water outside the Taonian mouth, which was more than two miles wide and had frozen over. After the inspection, Potterie. Gu Sang. Yang Baopu. Dai Qi. Wu Nankai and others stepped on the ice to cross the river to Dongzhuang. Pan Yifen. Song Wentian and others arrived a little later because the car was late and they had to take care of their luggage. The weather was getting dark and they could not cross the river, so they returned to Zhengying for accommodation. They crossed the river to Dongzhuang early on the 29th. Kong Xiangrong, acting chairman of the Yellow River Commission, had returned to Kaifeng due to official business a few days ago. Xu Hongkui, secretary-director of the commission, and engineer Wu Nankai accompanied Potterie and Gu Sang to inspect the Jiangsuba and the new dam foundation project, and stepped on the ice to cross the river to inspect the wrapping head and diversion canal of the Lisheng Tun East Dam. After the inspection, they returned to Dongzhuang for accommodation. Gu Sang and others are scheduled to go to Xi'an on the 30th, because they are commissioned by the Economic Commission to inspect the Xilan Highway. Potterie and others returned to Beijing via Kaifeng, and Song Wentian and Pan Yifen also returned to Jinan directly. As for the inspection of the damming project, the four newly built dams in Jiangsuba have been completed. The tenth dam, the stone dam, has been extended by 30 meters and heightened and thickened, which is extremely strong, with a height of 45 meters. The new dam foundation has been extended by 1,800 meters, has been completed, and has advanced to 11 sections, each occupying 245 meters. The mouth is currently only 472 meters wide and 7 meters deep in half. The water depth in Lisheng Tun is more than 6 meters. The diversion canal project has reached more than 5,000 people and is building sheds. Construction will start on the 30th. There are two roads, one more than 5 kilometers long and one more than 1 kilometer long. Excavating soil one deep three gentlemen, the average fee per gentleman is one yuan. Through a place, one tile house is dismantled, the price is 15 yuan, and a straw house is 10 yuan. The Yellow River water is lower than before. The water level at the mouth was about 54 meters on the 28th, and the flow rate was 300 cubic meters per second. The water level below the mouth was also more than 54 meters, and the flow rate was 330 cubic meters per second. 50% of the water returns to the nearby river, which is almost the same as when the Taonian breach occurred. The Taonian breach is two to three feet wide, the water is small and the flow is slow. More than half of the materials for damming have arrived at the work site, and the most sent from Fan County and Puyang County have reached the full amount. Changyuan, Putang within the territory of Hebei Province have not been delivered yet due to the distance. Juye County should share the materials, including 2 million catties of willow branches and straw, which must be delivered before February 8. 2,100 civilian workers should be required, but the county's straw has long been requisitioned and exhausted. One-quarter of the county was affected by the disaster last year, and another one-half has been affected by the disaster this time. The people's strength and financial resources have been extremely difficult, but because the damming project is important, they still try their best to support it and search for it in every possible way. Three-quarters of the straw has been sent, and one-quarter of the willow branches have been sent. The number is 110 yuan for 10,000 catties of straw, and 65% for each willow branch.</p>
<p>After the Juye County People's Levee was breached by the water, the flood has returned to the main river along the old river course. Now the people of Puyang County. Fan County. Shou Zhang. Yanggu County believe that since the Yellow River enters Shandong Province, it makes a bend to the north from Lisheng Tun and then flows to the east, which is not smooth, so the breach from Lisheng Tun has been decided for many years. It can be clearly stated that now that the Yellow River has opened the Juye County People's Levee, and has returned to the main river through the old river course, it is better to take advantage of the situation and guide it, let it change course, and then not only will the river disaster be reduced within the Jin Causeway, but the major dangerous work of Lisheng Tun can also be eliminated from now on. Therefore, I specially telegraphed Chairman Lin. President Jiang. Han Chairman, stated this opinion, please do not block the mouth of the Juye County People's Levee. It is found that this proposition naturally has some reason, but the people in the river set will definitely rise up against it, and the dam on the south bank will also be tight from now on, which is also a major issue that can be studied.

<h3>Chaoshan: Dispute over the Import of Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>Smugglers Organized with Both Open and Secret Methods</p>
<p>Simultaneously Smuggling Tungsten Ore for Export and Profit</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: On January 21st, at 2 PM, an incident occurred near Lianheli by the mouth of the sea in this city, where a Japanese police officer died suddenly. On the same day, armed military and police imposed temporary martial law along the Qilu coast, significantly affecting the city. Fortunately, no other accidents occurred. However, with the Lunar New Year approaching, the market has become even more depressed. Residents and merchants, in this situation, are returning to their hometowns for the holidays. Wharves and stations are extremely crowded with people, both men and women, carrying children and taking boats and cars. The people's unease can be imagined.</p>
<p>The Chaoshan Agricultural Special Tax Bureau's various tax revenues used to be over one million yuan per month. Considering only rice and beans, the monthly tax revenue was 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Since last June, affected by smugglers evading taxes and smuggling, monthly tax revenue has dropped to only 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. This was the situation in the past. After the implementation of the anti-smuggling network on December 1st, tax revenue began to increase again. However, this resulted in a direct conflict with the interests of smugglers. For more than a month, all Sino-Japanese negotiations and disputes have arisen from this, and none have been fundamentally and satisfactorily resolved. Accumulated cases have increased, and disputes have intensified, evolving from economic problems into national affairs involving treaties, sovereignty, and various other issues. The complex situation can hardly be described in words. It is well known that the Chaoshan smugglers are organized by Japanese adventurers with a large background. Their influence has deeply penetrated the various market towns in the Chaoshan and Meizhou hinterland, divided into open and secret operations. Open operations are conducted by 38 merchants and trading companies, directly declaring goods for import, relying on commercial status to avoid special taxes, surcharges, and additional fees imposed by the local government. Secret operations involve heavily taxed goods, directly hiring steamers and sailing ships to transport goods from other ports to the coastal areas of Chaoshan, and then transferring them to various inland areas. The Chaoshan-Meizhou Anti-Smuggling Office has over 500 anti-smuggling soldiers, who also penetrate the Chaoshan-Meizhou hinterland, along with shallow-water anti-smuggling vessels patrolling the coast and various tributaries of the inland river. The Chaoshan Anti-Smuggling Director Xiao Sheng recently returned to the province, reportedly to request the Anti-Smuggling Headquarters to send additional anti-smuggling vessels and personnel to Chaoshan for assistance. It is planned that the patrol vessels of the Chaozhou Customs will be dedicated to dealing with secret smugglers. The smugglers have substantial capital, often operating with three or four steamers and sailing ships, fully loaded with heavily taxed goods such as matches and alcohol, smuggling them from other ports. For example, when the first ship is seized and towed back to Shantou, the second and third ships take the opportunity to sail into the hinterland of Chaoyang and Chenghai, making it impossible for the investigators to attend to all of them. The Chaozhou Customs currently has two vessels, "Beidou" and "Chaomei." Recently, feeling that they are not sufficient to handle the workload, two additional vessels have been built in Hong Kong and will soon return to Shantou to assist. In December, the Chaozhou Customs seized a "Jinrong Maru," and in January, they seized a "Chuanxiang Maru" in the waters of Nan'ao. Both were fully loaded with matches, sugar, seafood, silk fabrics, and alcohol, worth a significant amount. The eight smugglers on board were all of a certain nationality. In addition to confiscating the ships and goods, the customs sent the smugglers to the Supervision Office for interrogation, and then handed them over to the relevant consulate to handle themselves. There has been no further news about these two cases. It is reported that the authorities have conducted formal diplomatic negotiations, but how they will be resolved is unknown to the outside world. However, driven by profit, smugglers continue their smuggling activities despite repeated crackdowns. Compared to the potential gains, the risks are still worthwhile, and the strictness of the investigation does not deter them from their smuggling intentions. According to a report from Long'ao Qianren in the second district of Nan'ao County, "Around midnight on January 20th, several steamers and sailing ships suddenly gathered in the Houjiang area, taking advantage of the darkness and cold weather. Each ship was loaded with smuggled goods such as oil and sugar. The smugglers first hired fishermen and coolies, and then armed them to transport the goods late at night, directly from Dashigang into Gangqian Township, and finished unloading by dawn, piling them up in secret locations. It is reported that the smuggled goods belong to a certain unscrupulous merchant named Yang. They are first transported by a certain nationality's steamer to Gongkou in Zhao'an, Fujian, and then transferred by sailing ships to Nan'ao County. The smuggling company has a large organization, with workers and warehouses everywhere to handle the transportation and concealment. When someone wants to buy from him, he can guarantee delivery to the store, and then collect the money." It is reported that certain foreign unscrupulous smugglers are not only smuggling goods in, but also smuggling heavily taxed goods out. A certain merchant in Shantou's Tongjin Street recently raised funds on a large scale to expand its business. This is because Chaoshan, Meizhou, and the Ganbian area produce tungsten ore, which can be used by various countries to manufacture military supplies. The government originally has a monopoly on tungsten ore, and civilians cannot operate it privately. In Hong Kong, each 100 catties currently costs 80 to 90 yuan, and at its highest, it is worth 130 to 140 yuan. Private miners in Chaoshan and Meizhou sell it for only 20 to 30 yuan per 100 catties. If it is smuggled out, a large profit can be made. Currently, Shantou smugglers are sending people to Chao'an inland to set up agencies to buy tungsten ore in small quantities, and then finding ways to smuggle it out. Last month, dozens of loads were seized by the Anti-Smuggling Office in a certain area of Chao'an. However, the smugglers have many accomplices and great power. In the past month, there have been few crackdowns, and there are rumors of expanding the organization. Anti-smuggling checkpoints are everywhere like a dragnet, but the smugglers also have cells in various strategic locations by land and water. This is because the people of Chaoshan and Meizhou have been impoverished for years, and unemployed people who will do anything are easily recruited and exploited by smugglers. (January 23rd)</p>
<h3>Jiangsong: Trial of a Kidnapping Case in Xiaokunshan</h3>
<p>Jinlan, the grandson of Fan Shulou, a resident of Xiaokunshan, was kidnapped on the night of October 29th last year. It was not until December that the kidnappers and the victim negotiated the ransom at the entrance of Dongta Lane, where the investigation team of the No. 1 Public Security Bureau arrested the kidnapper Mao Jinzhang. He confessed that his accomplices were Zhu Guangyuan, Sheng Qinghe, and Zhu Baokang, who were subsequently arrested.

The four defendants, Mao Jinzhang, et al., all recanted their confessions, claiming that they were obtained through torture. However, an examination of their bodies revealed no injuries, and Fan, who had been involved in the negotiations, identified Mao Jinzhang in court. The presiding judge, Zhang Yihuang, ordered further investigation and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Three Years Imprisonment for Using Counterfeit Currency</h3>
<p>Recently, a large number of counterfeit coins have been found in the market here, and the authorities are paying close attention to the investigation. On the afternoon of the 30th, a man named Zhu San carried five-jiao coins from the Central Bank to a cigarette shop in Fangqiao in the city for exchange. The shopkeeper carefully examined the coins and found the patterns to be crude, recognizing them as counterfeit. He urged Zhu to exchange them, but Zhu continued to exchange them, reaching four or five coins. The local police arrested Zhu and sent him to the police station, who transferred him to the county judiciary. Zhu claimed that he had obtained the coins from Lu Xiaoyun in Junzilong, South of the city. An investigation was conducted, but no such person was found. After repeated questioning by the judge, Zhu finally confessed to using counterfeit currency. As a result, he was sentenced to three years imprisonment and immediately signed and taken into custody.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Zhang Yipeng Sues Daguanming Daily</h3>
<p>Zhang Yipeng, the director of the Wuxian Relief Institute and a local gentry, sued the Suzhou Daguanming Daily for allegedly defaming him in a short article published the day before. Zhang Yipeng claimed that the article insinuated that he was a "charity swindler." He hired lawyer Jin Henian and filed a complaint with the Wuxian Local Court, accusing the newspaper's editor, Feng Pingying, of defamation and requesting that he be summoned to court. After receiving the complaint, the court immediately summoned the plaintiff and defendant for a hearing at 10 AM on the 31st. The plaintiff, Zhang Yipeng, accompanied by lawyer Jin, appeared in court. As the defendant was absent, the judge questioned the plaintiff and ordered that the defendant be summoned for another hearing.</p>

The roadbed and culvert projects are scheduled to be completed by the end of June.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Villager Shot Dead in Gambling Raid</h3>
<p>Jiang Qiaoru, the patrol leader of the second police substation in Benniu Town, Wujin County, led police officers to raid a gambling den near Tangzhuangjia. Villagers gathered to seize the gamblers, causing the patrol leader's holstered gun to discharge accidentally, hitting a villager named Zhou Xilong. He was rushed to Wujin Hospital for treatment. On the evening of the 29th, he was still able to speak and was mentally clear. However, on the 30th, his body temperature suddenly rose, causing severe pain. Despite the doctor's efforts, he died at around 5 PM. Upon hearing this, the Public Security Bureau immediately reported the information to the local court and requested that personnel be sent to conduct an autopsy. The police officer, Liu Rongguan, who discharged the gun, was sent to the prosecutor's office. After an interrogation by Chief Prosecutor Yang Kongxi, he was ordered to be detained. He personally went to conduct an autopsy on the 31st to verify the facts and handle the matter accordingly. The Silk Control Committee of the Zhejiang Construction Department has been decided by the Provincial Government Committee to be directly under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Government.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Large-Scale Promotion of Spring Silkworms in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>Zeng Yangfu will continue to serve as the chairman. The reorganization and establishment will be implemented from the 1st. The staff will remain unchanged. As the spring silkworm breeding season is approaching, farmers in various counties are paying their deposit for the silkworm eggs. The price is set at 2 jiao per sheet. Up to recently, more than 200,000 sheets have been paid for, requiring a total of more than 1.2 million silkworm eggs. In addition to ordering more than 600,000 sheets from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the remaining 600,000 sheets will be purchased from abroad for distribution and application. The improved area last year was 29 counties and cities. Yiwu and Pingyang counties have now been added to actively promote the plan. The guiding plan is being drafted, and the control management method may be changed. The Jiaxing County Government arrested seven suspects last year for privately collecting hard currency: Hong Weijin, Hong Fusheng, Chen Xinqiao, Wang Deye, Wang Chunyong, Chen Tongwen, and He Baoquan. After investigation by the prosecutor's office of the local court, they were all prosecuted under the second and fifth articles of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Harming National Currency. Yesterday, the criminal court judge began the trial. After questioning each of the defendants in turn, the judge announced that an investigation was necessary. Hong Weijin, Hong Fusheng, Chen Xinqiao, Wang Deye, Wang Chunyong, and Chen Tongwen were released on bail after providing written guarantees and bail money. He Baoquan was remanded in custody due to lack of bail.</p>
<h3>Taizhou: Fishermen Seek Relief from Authorities</h3>
<p>There are more than 3,000 households in Feiweshan, Dongxiang, Yuling, who make a living by fishing. The fishing season was poor last winter, and their lives are difficult. Even their daily three meals have become a problem. Therefore, the fishermen appointed Guo as their representative to seek relief from the authorities. At the end of the old lunar year, they announced to the public by beating gongs that they would not worship heaven, would not pay homage to their ancestors, would not make New Year cakes, and would suspend payments of accounts, waiting for the fishing season to improve next spring before repaying.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: We are writing to you regarding the local news column in your newspaper, which reported that the Haoxin bus crashed at the Pu station, causing serious injuries to more than ten people and killing two elderly women on the spot. This report is slightly inaccurate. On the day in question, the bus was driving uphill on Pu Mountain when a pedestrian suddenly crossed in front of the bus. The driver had no choice but to brake to avoid the pedestrian. Unexpectedly, the bus lost its momentum and rolled backwards, losing control and falling into the paddy fields below the slope. All injured passengers were treated by a doctor within half an hour and are all safe and sound. We are requesting that you publish this letter in your newspaper to provide accurate information. Sincerely, Haoxin Road Bus Company.</p>
<p>At 3:12 PM on January 21, 1936, the current Okada Cabinet in Japan dissolved the Japanese Parliament with the supreme power of a "decree." The reason for the dissolution was: The government is in a major situation, and only by relying on the "national unity" of cooperation can the government's stated program be realized. However, "observing the recent political situation, the House of Representatives cannot smoothly promote national affairs. The government must implement fair and impartial elections, hoping to realize the government's prestige under a clear political power." Therefore, it requested the dissolution of Parliament.</p>
<p>It is now a campaign season in which nothing is impossible. The general election is scheduled for February 20th of this year.</p>
<p>The dissolution of Parliament is not something to be surprised about. If the opposition party occupies a majority in Parliament and is preparing to submit a motion of no confidence against the current cabinet, if the cabinet has the power to dissolve Parliament? Of course, it will use it. The Seiyukai, the opposition party to the current Okada Cabinet, occupies a majority in the current Parliament, and the motion of no confidence that the Seiyukai wants to submit has long been prepared. In this situation, the House of Representatives will inevitably be dissolved.</p>
<p>The Seiyukai has many reasons to express its lack of confidence. In short, the conclusion is nothing more than saying "the current government does not have the ability to shoulder major situations."</p>
<p>There is no need to describe the dissolution process in detail. The content of the election is something that should be given special attention. The questions we are paying attention to are: What are the forces that control Parliament? What will be the result of the election? After the new Parliament is formed, how much change will it bring to Japanese domestic politics, and what reforms will it bring to international relations?</p>

<h3>Intensifying Competition: Japanese "Election Purification"</h3>
<p>——As a Transition to War Preparation in "Extraordinary Times"——</p>
<p>3:00 PM on January 21, 1936 (2)</p>
<p>First, the most noteworthy thing is that, whether it is the current government, the current government and the party, or the opposition party, they are all loudly proclaiming: "The situation is serious." This is what the Japanese military shouts every day: "Extraordinary times." Moreover, the military was the first to shout "extraordinary times." The military has long believed that party politics is weak, rejects party politics, and declares that party politics cannot properly deal with "extraordinary times." Of course, it would be better to have a political party that completely listens to the military's commands.</p>
<p>Since Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, and recently withdrew from the Disarmament Conference, at this stage of its power development, Japan not only has considerable power to prevent the Soviet Union from communizing East Asia, but has also taken an offensive posture to monopolize East Asian interests. During this period, it must not only prepare to fight the Soviet Union and the forces it leads, but also be prepared to use ample blood and bullets to attack when conflicts of interest with the great powers cannot be reconciled.</p>
<p>Actively preparing for war requires actively increasing military spending. In the 1936 Japanese budget, military spending accounted for 46% of the total. The total is nearly 2.3 billion. However, the military still thinks it is not enough. If military spending is increased again, it will be necessary to increase the issuance of public bonds, and even increase taxes. The Takahashi fiscal policy is to advocate "gradually reducing public bonds," and at the same time believes that "the time for increasing taxes has not yet arrived." Not long ago, Takahashi Korekiyo worked hard for days, arguing all night, before making his 1936 budget established. Although the amount increased by the Navy and Army's "new regulations" has already reached more than 216.8 million yuan, it has not yet been satisfied by the military.</p>
<p>Such a large increase is still too little in the eyes of the military in "extraordinary times." Moreover, the recent breakdown of disarmament negotiations will obviously promote naval race: even Takahashi has already stated that the cost of naval vessel reorganization must be increased.</p>
<p>Naturally, it is the general military industrial capitalists who actively support and support the military's demands. The current so-called "economic recovery" is mainly due to the rapid advance of military industries in the expansion of colonies and the progress of monopolies. There is no doubt that military industries can be highly developed in the process of war preparation. Recently, "Sumitomo" has been very active in the manufacture of aircraft. The nature of the military is semi-feudal, but the military cannot be active without the support of financial capitalists.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental characteristics of Japanese capitalism is: "Using a few military monopolies to supplement the monopoly of the most modern financial capital; at the same time, it also has the nature of acting as an agent for financial capital." The fundamental reason for promoting Japanese fascism lies here, and the reason for Japan's establishment of a tough foreign policy is nothing more than this.</p>
<p>The "extraordinary times" shouted out by the military awakened the current cabinet's so-called "major situation" and "national unity." And other political parties and factions cannot help but think "the situation is serious"?</p>
<p>In this major situation, Japan has accurately judged that ... the League of Nations is a powerless meeting of great powers — Japan and Germany withdrew from the League of Nations, and the League of Nations could do nothing. Today's Italian-Ethiopian War is actually a conflict between Italy and Britain, but the League of Nations, led by Britain, has not been able to impose any real sanctions on Italy. Although the US Navy is strong, its power may not be sufficient to expedition to Japan. Furthermore, the domestic political struggles of the great powers are expanding, the economic panic has not yet been overcome, and in addition, the colonial national revolutions are rising (such as the recent rise of Egypt's independence movement) — under these facts, as long as Japan gives the great powers some kind of compromise, such as what Foreign Minister Hirota said, "To have the great powers recognize Japan as the central force for maintaining stability in East Asia," this is very promising to achieve. As for the Soviet Union, it is burying its head in working hard on the Second Five-Year Plan, and it must also constantly guard against German attacks; since the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway to Japan, it has clearly expressed a step backward. The recent increase in troops in the Far East is only its own defense in the east.</p>
<p>In this "extraordinary time," the tasks of the so-called three countries with "insufficient colonies," Italy, which has already launched an expedition to East Africa, Germany, which has launched a colonial return movement, and Japan, are naturally self-evident.</p>
<p>However, in the eyes of the military, Japan's existing larger political parties cannot shoulder the task of this "extraordinary time" and "major situation."</p>
<p>But a major political party that is fully capable of representing the military, or completely listening to the military's commands, has not yet been formed. The military allows the current cabinet to exist, but only because today's cabinet is originally a bureaucratic cabinet, which can be dominated by it by five or six points or more. It is of course impossible for the nearly established new Parliament and cabinet to be relatively unaffected by the military; but it is not certain that a new Parliament that is completely subject to it can be produced at this time. However, most of the current larger political parties, such as the Seiyukai and the Minseito, originally represent financial capitalists. At present, it is a mixed rule of financial capital and semi-feudalism, so most of the problems here are only internal contradictions in the ruling class. In the development of these internal contradictions, as long as the power of the lower masses is discovered or even mutually aware, this problem will inevitably be coordinated and controlled. For example, the power of "extraordinary times" can be used to control them.</p>
<p>Moreover, this control will be national strengthening, military, political, and economic control. Because "extraordinary times" or "major situations" are just another name for war preparation.</p>

<h3>Banks and Money Shops: Business Tightening in the Year, Joint Consultation to Reduce Interest Rates</h3>
<p>According to the New Sound News reporter's inquiries to the money shop industry yesterday, the profits of each money shop last year were at most only over 50,000 yuan, while more than 20 of them were just breaking even, which is rare in history. The new business policy of the money shops after the market listing is the same as that of the commercial banks, which is to tighten up together in order to barely maintain the status quo. Although the revolving credit overdraft booklets have already been sent out, the overdraft amount is limited according to the credit of various factories, merchants, firms, and companies. As for the newly organized money shops, there is no news. As for the commercial banks, they tightened up after the year-end closing last year, reducing staff in the departments of cashiers, remittance, and issuance in order to save expenses. In the future, they will also be particularly cautious about lending.</p>
<h3>Acceptance of Bills of Exchange: Continued Promotion</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee enthusiastically accepted the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's suggestion to allocate funds to promote the acceptance of bills of exchange, it drafted measures and submitted them to the Ministry of Finance for review. Now it has been approved by the Ministry. Because the acceptance of bills of exchange is one of the ordinary banking businesses, and each bank has already started it, there is no need to set up another agency to handle it exclusively. The New Sound News reporter inquired from relevant industries yesterday, and the commercial acceptance of bills of exchange has long been implemented in industries such as silk and satin weaving. At the same time, the Silver and Money Shop Association has notified its members to accept acceptance as much as possible. Now, in order to popularize it, various industries are working hard to continue to promote it.</p>
<h3>Reduction of Interest Rates: Consultation to be Held Soon</h3>
<p>After the Silver and Money Shop Association and the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank were ordered by the Ministry of Finance to reduce interest rates, the Silver and Money Shop Association decided that the prerequisite for reducing interest rates was to reduce deposit interest rates, which would be gradually implemented after careful study. Now it has been decided that after Chen Guangfu, the chairman of the Banking Association, returns to Shanghai from Beijing, a joint meeting of the silver and money industries will be held again. When the joint meeting is held, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications will be notified to attend, and a committee will be formed to study the strategy for implementation. As for the Central Bank, after receiving the order, it has been handed over to Hu Meian, the deputy manager of the business bureau, for handling.</p>
<h3>Disturbances in the Securities Market</h3>
<p>According to a confidential report to the Ministry of Finance, the value of the Securities Exchange fluctuated sharply on January 28th, which was manipulated by traitors. The actions of several brokers were particularly prominent. The Ministry of Finance sent six members including Liang Ping, Zhu Xuanzhang, Fu Yan, Xu Zhichu, Wang Jisen, and Liu Xilu to investigate thoroughly. Now the reply presented is quite different from the confidential report. The Ministry of Finance specially issued another order to reply. The original order said: "It has been learned that the trading situation of the Chinese Securities Exchange on January 28th has not revealed any deliberate disturbances, which is quite inconsistent with the confidential report. Did each broker have any illegal activities on that day? Please investigate thoroughly and report truthfully, without any regard. Also, please investigate and report the type and quantity of bonds delivered in January, the buyers and sellers, and their true names one by one for verification." This is the order.</p>
<h3>Public Servants: Speculation and Manipulation</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance received the report from Wang Xiaolai and Qu Zhaorong that they continued to investigate the quantity of securities traded by each broker and the situation of Broker No. 48 Xinda selling bonds, and did not find any involvement of agency personnel in the transactions, the Ministry again ordered Wang and Qu: "It has been learned from the report that you continued to investigate the quantity of securities traded by each broker and the situation of Broker No. 48 Xinda selling bonds, and did not find any involvement of agency personnel in the transactions. Please continue to investigate thoroughly and strictly, and you must understand it completely. Other brokers with large trading volumes should also be investigated one by one, without any favoritism. If you find any public servants speculating, you should immediately report it confidentially for investigation. Brokers who are definitely found to have no public servants engaging in naked speculation and manipulation should be ordered to prepare a written guarantee that they have not accepted any commissions from public servants for naked speculation and manipulation, and that they are willing to be jointly and severally liable for false statements in order to show caution and prevent abuses. Please follow this order."</p>
<h3>Various Industries Announce Cash Transactions Due to Tight Credit Conditions: Bean and Rice Industry Agreed to Pay Cash; Sauce Garden Industry Clears Accounts at the End of Each Gregorian Calendar Month; Cotton Cloth and Pig Industries Also Stipulate Measures</h3>
<p>Due to the impact of the sluggish market, various industries in this city failed to fully collect their accounts during the last general settlement, and their economic turnover was extremely difficult. Now they are all announcing cash transactions in order to remedy the situation. The New News Agency reporter has recorded the cash transaction announcements and resolutions of various industries as follows:</p>
<h3>Bean and Rice Industry</h3>
<p>A notice from the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Guild states: We respectfully inform you that since last year, the commercial situation has been extremely depressed. The financial sector, unable to adequately support itself, has severely tightened credit for all industries, leading to a standstill. Consequently, the use of resources by our industry has also come to a standstill. Moreover, as our members act as agents for customers in buying and selling, with limited capital, we have no ability or obligation to advance funds. At the beginning of this year's business, we must seek improvement to ensure our survival. Therefore, on January 27th, we convened all members for a meeting to decide that, starting from the following day, all transactions must be paid for in cash. For those within reach of a rickshaw, and who wish to pledge goods in a warehouse, please pay 20% of the total price in cash upfront. If transportation is inconvenient and full payment cannot be made, a large portion of the price must be paid in advance before loading. As our industry's capabilities are limited, it is difficult to fulfill this commission. This notice is issued specifically for this reason.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Industry</h3>
<p>A notice from the Shanghai Cotton Cloth Industry Guild states: It has been found that Article 12 of our industry regulations states, "Payment for goods delivered by local traders shall be made on the 8th (upper period) and 23rd (lower period) of each month. The upper period ends on the 15th of the month, and the lower period ends at the end of the month, and all accounts must be settled by the due date." Article 13 states, "Local traders must pay their debts in cash or with ten-day bank drafts. Checks and promissory notes shall not be accepted under any circumstances." All traders delivering goods should abide by these rules. To prevent violations, our guild convened a meeting of the delivery group yesterday and decided that, in addition to reprinting the above two industry regulations in the Shen and Xin newspapers to inform customers to comply, all delivery traders must strictly adhere to them. Anyone found violating the rules privately will be punished according to the regulations. This special notice is issued according to the decision. We hope all customers will take note and comply.</p>
<h3>Sauce and Pickle Industry</h3>
<p>A notice from the Shanghai Sauce and Pickle Industry Association states: We respectfully inform you that our industry has traditionally settled accounts in three installments. However, due to the current tight credit situation in Shanghai, coupled with high costs, business operations are becoming increasingly difficult. Therefore, on December 26th of last year, all members jointly decided that all outstanding payments should be settled by the end of each month in the Gregorian calendar to facilitate turnover. This special notice is hereby given.</p>
<h3>Pork Industry</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fresh Pork Industry Guild also convened a meeting a few days ago to discuss and improve business practices. The following measures were established for customer accounts: 1. Submit an application form with detailed information for review. 2. Upon successful review, pay a cash guarantee based on the requested transaction amount. 3. If no cash guarantee is provided, conduct cash purchases for two full years, and then assess the business situation to determine credit. All customers have been informed in detail.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Sends Officials to Supervise Securities Settlement Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that after the Chinese Securities Exchange suspended trading for the past two days to handle the settlement of securities for January, the Ministry of Finance specially dispatched Xu Zhizhu and others to supervise the process, prohibiting brokers from settling transactions privately outside the exchange. The settlement was completed last night, totaling over five million yuan. Trading will resume as usual today. However, for both new and old transactions, all sellers must provide the corresponding goods in full. The bank clearing house, due to yesterday being the securities settlement date, increased the number of clearings to four. As a result, the total amount cleared increased sharply, totaling 18,494,962.31 yuan, with 6,035,100.45 yuan collected by money shops and 3,800,279.91 yuan by others, for a total of 19,478,752.67 yuan in cleared documents.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Citizens' Federation Notifies Subordinates to Display Flags Upon Hu Hanmin's Arrival in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Hu Hanmin, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee, will soon go to the capital to assume his post. The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation has specially notified its branches to instruct all shops and residents to display flags to welcome Hu upon his arrival in Shanghai. The notice states: We respectfully inform you that Mr. Hu Zhantang, the newly appointed Chairman of the Central Executive Committee, has returned from overseas and has arrived in Guangdong. He will soon take a ship to the north. Various organizations and groups in Shanghai have formed the Shanghai Committee for Welcoming Chairman Hu Zhantang's Appointment to the Capital.

<h3>Guangxi Provincial Government Sends Personnel to Inspect Highways in Various Provinces; Xihu Company Hosts Liang Quan and Others for a Tour</h3>
<p>Huang Xuchu, Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, has been actively promoting highway construction in the province in recent years. Currently, there are over 2,000 kilometers of highways open to traffic in the province. The section from Guilin to Changsha, Hunan, will be open to traffic in May of this year. It will soon be possible to travel directly by car from Shanghai to Guilin. Huang has recently observed that the highways in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces are highly developed, and the use of charcoal-powered vehicles has been very successful, which could serve as a reference for his province. Therefore, he specially appointed Liang Quan, General Manager of the Guixingyu Minban Automobile Road Company, and Chen Lichong, Assistant Manager, to inspect various provinces. Liang and his party arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and contacted the highway authorities in each province. At 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, they first went to the Xihu Long-Distance Bus Company, where they were accompanied by the company's manager, Zhu Kai, for a week-long tour of the factory. Zhu had to attend the Bai Mao Gate laying ceremony, so he specially invited Jiang Yuren, the company's general affairs director, Wu Zhongyi, the transportation director, Wang Zongshan, the engineering director, engineers Wang Shuntao and Zhu Zhongqian, as well as Fan Zhengbo, the general manager of the Zhongming Factory, and Tang Yunqing, the manager, to host them. At around 10:00 a.m., they drove the No. 18 charcoal-powered passenger car, manufactured by Zhongming Factory, to Changshu, which took only two hours and ten minutes, consuming 40 kilograms of charcoal, with an average speed of 35 yards. Liang and his party greatly praised the road engineering and various facilities, believing that they could provide many references for Guangxi Province. They were also satisfied with the achievements of the Zhongming charcoal-powered vehicle and will request the factory to establish a branch in Guangxi to facilitate mass production. The Xihu Road authorities, considering that Liang and his party had come from afar, specially hosted a banquet at the Shanjing Garden in Changshu and visited the scenic Yushan Mountain. At around 4:00 p.m., they returned to Suzhou in the No. 18 car. Liang and his party will travel to Hangzhou in the coming days, and then follow the Jinghang National Highway to Beijing, before proceeding to Jiangxi Province and other places for inspection.</p>

<h3>Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs Vigorously Implements Factory Registration and Stipulates Punishment Measures</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs began implementing factory registration, the process has been progressing smoothly. However, due to the vast area of ​​the city and the large number of factories, there are still some who do not comply with the order and have a wait-and-see attitude. The bureau believes that factory registration is the foundation for improving industry and is deeply related to the national economy and people's livelihood. Therefore, it has specially formulated punishment measures. Those who fail to apply for registration in accordance with the order will not be granted any requests for tax reductions, tax exemptions, patents, proof of domestic goods, or protection in the event of disputes. At the same time, all factories will be notified to earnestly carry out registration procedures. It is reported that the bureau hopes to complete the registration of all factories in the city in the next few months and submit it to the Ministry of Industry for comprehensive statistics and to seek improvement in the national industry.</p>

<h3>Yu Qiaqing Visited Chiang Kai-shek in Beijing Yesterday to Request Relief for Industry and Commerce; Four Points Presented Were Adopted</h3>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that Yu Qiaqing, a leader in Shanghai's industrial circles, visited Chiang Kai-shek in Beijing to seek relief for industry and commerce and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Yu at the Sanbei Company, where he gave a speech, saying that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has worked hard for the country and is extremely concerned about maintaining industry and commerce. Although the financial authorities have already established relief measures, they have not been put into practice. Recently, the scope of establishing a real estate bank and other measures has been too narrow, focusing only on real estate, and the entire industry has not received substantial benefits, resulting in continued depression. To prosper the market and revive the countryside, the prerequisite is to provide relief to industry and commerce. It is determined that some people are speculating and manipulating the market, causing those with capital to be unwilling to invest in industry and commerce, which has a significant impact. He is an old friend of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and for the sake of both public and private interests, he will sincerely contribute his knowledge. He went to Beijing to present his opinions: 1. It is hoped that speculation and market manipulation will be investigated. 2. Relief for industry and commerce should be practical and not just empty words as reported in the newspapers. 3. The previously suggested establishment of a special bank to assume real estate that generates profits from industry is not a real estate bank that only assumes real estate that generates rental income. 4. Using legal tender is the best policy, and production should be relieved to balance imports and exports. If we do not care about industry and commerce and do not balance imports and exports, even using legal tender would be dangerous. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek agreed to adopt all of the above points.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Year Association Urges the Use of National Goods; Second Decision Propaganda Conference to Be Held</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Year National Goods Movement Association, scheduled to hold the Second Decision Propaganda Conference at the Mass Education Center on Wenmiao Road on the 10th of this month, specially sent a letter to the Mass Education Center yesterday to request the use of the venue, and sent letters to the First and Second Special Districts Citizens' Federations of this association, requesting them to urge all citizens to purchase and use national goods. The letters are recorded as follows: To the Mass Education Center: We respectfully inform you that since the establishment of this association on New Year's Day, we have actively promoted and advocated the use of national goods to all sectors, hoping that the import of foreign goods will decrease sharply this year, and the export of national goods will increase sharply. In order to expand publicity, it is stipulated that a propaganda conference will be held every month. The first decision conference was held on New Year's Day. The second decision conference is scheduled to be held at the lecture hall of your center at 1:00 p.m. on February 10th. This letter is specially prepared to request permission to borrow the venue. This matter concerns national goods, so we hope you will agree. To the First and Second Special Districts Citizens' Federations: We respectfully inform you that since the establishment of this association, in view of the past National Goods Years, the annual trade deficit has been alarming. The reason is that the general public has become accustomed to favoring foreign goods and cannot change their psychology in a short time. This association is called the Citizens' National Goods Year. All citizens, as the name implies, must uniformly use and promote national goods in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. This letter is specially sent to your associations, requesting you to immediately urge all citizens to purchase and use national goods, so that foreign goods will naturally be cut off, and the future of industry will see a glimmer of light.</p>
<h3>Beiyang Ships to Increase Ice River Fee by 40% Starting Today; Yushen Ship in Danger of Being Trapped by Ice; Chinese Ships Suspended While Foreign Ships Continue</h3>
<p>It is determined that northern China is extremely cold, and both the inner harbor and the outer sea of Tianjin are simultaneously frozen. The ice field on the sea reaches 150 li. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yushen ship was trapped by ice and damaged. The northern goods destined for England, France, Holland, and Germany were completely interrupted. Yesterday, a telegram reported that the Yushen had escaped danger and is now being repaired in Tanggu. The overseas has become a flowing ice field, making navigation very difficult. Beiyang ships from Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Nisshin and other companies are still operating as usual, while Chinese ships remain suspended. However, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and other companies have agreed to cancel the previously set 20% ice river fee starting today and revise it separately. Starting from February 1st, the ice river shipping fee will be increased by 40% according to the set rate. A notice has been issued to the Beiyang gang and various customs brokers.</p>
<h3>Sanbei Company's "Zhenbei" Runs Aground at the Mouth of the Yangtze River; Route Changed to the Upper Yangtze Once; Runs Aground Due to Decreased Water Level; Fuyang Is Rescuing</h3>
<p>The Sanbei Company's Zhenbei ship originally sailed to Ningbo Cixi and never sailed to Shanghai. In mid-last month, due to the large number of shipments from Shanghai to Sichuan and the sharp decline in the Yangtze River water level, all large ships of various companies were suspended. The shipping fee for the Sichuan River route was better than other routes. The company specially sent the ship from Ningbo to Shanghai. Because of its shallow draft, it was temporarily dispatched to sail the upper Yangtze once to meet the needs of passengers and freight, and the company could also earn a huge amount of freight. On the 19th of last month, the ship was fully loaded and prepared to sail to Yichang, and then transfer the goods to other ships to go upstream. However, on the afternoon of January 30th, when the ship reached the mouth of the Yangtze River, dozens of miles away from Yichang, the water level dropped too much, and the shallowest place was only five feet. It suddenly ran aground. Because it was heavily loaded, the ship could not get out of the shallow water and sent a telegram for help. The company's Sichuan River ship Fuyang was traveling upstream from Hankou via Shashi. Upon hearing this news, it went to the rescue, intending to tow it first. If it could not be towed out, the cargo would be unloaded to reduce the ship's load and float the ship to safety. (Note: The Zhenbei ship has a deadweight of 173 tons, a length of 115 feet and 4 inches, a width of 9 feet and 2 inches, a depth of 7 feet and 3 inches, a draft of only 5 feet, and 150 horsepower. It was built in 1914 and is smaller than the Yaobei.)</p>
<h3>China International Famine Relief Commission Organizes Relief Work in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission at 505 Henan Road is a well-known charitable organization registered with the Ministry of Interior. Its purpose is to focus on construction and disaster relief. Since its establishment in the tenth year of the Republic of China, it has spent more than 12 million yuan on relief projects such as road construction, well digging, canal excavation, and dike repair. Recently, due to the severe disaster situation in northern Jiangsu, it allocated another 5,000 yuan for road construction needs in the Haizhou area, handing it over to Pastor Ming Lelin of the Christian Presbyterian Church to organize the relief work. It also first distributed 886 pieces of relief clothing, which were transferred free of charge by the United Steamship Company for the victims to keep warm. Bu Youmen, a pastor of the Christian Presbyterian Church in Suqian, sent a letter on behalf of the victims. It is said that the association has also allocated 40 pieces of Kriden cloth, which will be distributed by the pastor to make clothes.</p>
<h3>Linhai County Relief Association Sends Personnel to Inspect and Accept Relief Work; The Association Will Send Personnel to Inspect and Accept in the Coming Days</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Relief Association for Flood Disasters in Various Provinces allocated relief funds last autumn to Linhai County, Zhejiang Province, due to the severe drought disaster. It entrusted the Linhai County Government to organize relief work to save the disaster-stricken people. All projects have now been completed. The association recently received a letter from the Linhai County Government requesting it to send personnel to inspect and accept the work in order to ensure the proper use of relief funds. The original letter stated: This county suffered a severe drought last year. We are grateful for your association's allocation of relief funds to organize relief work, so that various transportation and water conservancy projects in the county could be completed. Poor disaster victims were able to work for relief and avoid displacement, benefiting immensely. All projects have now been completed one after another. We hereby request you to send personnel to inspect and accept the work in order to ensure the proper use of relief funds. It is reported that the association has scheduled to dispatch personnel in the coming days to inspect and accept the work.</p>
<h3>Second Phase of Railway Bonds Issued on the Same Day; Mortgage Contract to Be Signed Within Days</h3>
<p>In order to build the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the Ministry of Railways issued the second phase of railway construction bonds totaling 27 million yuan. Zeng Yangfu of the Ministry of Railways negotiated the mortgage matters with the banking community in Shanghai, which has been completed. Chen, director of the Shanghai office of the Purchasing Committee, has submitted the application to the ministry for approval and will begin issuing the bonds on the 1st. The bonds will not be circulated in the market. The mortgage contract is expected to be signed within days. It is planned to borrow 18 million yuan from the banking syndicate in Shanghai and the German Otto Wolff Steel Factory, with 10 million yuan for labor costs and 8 million yuan for material costs. The banking syndicate will allocate the funds in installments, and the German factory will supply the materials.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Instructs That Cargo Return Slips Should Be Stamped; Responsibility Lies with the Actual and Legal Evidencer</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, in response to an inquiry regarding the stamping of cargo return slips, replied to Risheng Paper Store: In response to your letter of the 30th of this month, inquiring whether the return slips used with the invoice with sufficient tax paid should be stamped, etc., it has been found that the cargo return slip is the receipt for goods in Article 16, Paragraph 2 of the Stamp Tax Law. It is stipulated that if the price of the goods is 3 yuan or more, it should be stamped. Your letter states that the invoice has been stamped with sufficient tax, and it is believed that the receipt should not be stamped again. This is a misunderstanding. The invoice is the certificate given by the seller to the customer, and the responsibility for stamping lies with the issuer of the invoice. The cargo receipt is the certificate issued by the customer to the seller, and the responsibility for stamping lies with the issuer of the receipt. Although the return slip is prepared by the seller on behalf of the customer, this is the same as a printing shop printing blank receipts on behalf of others and should not be regarded as the "evidencer" in Article 16, Paragraph 2 of the Stamp Tax Law. The person who signs or stamps the return slip is the actual and legal evidencer. Based on this, the responsibility for stamping lies with the customer, not the seller, so there is no so-called double taxation. If the stamp is omitted, the person who signed the return slip should be punished.</p>
<h3>Restaurant Industry: Aviation Donation Collection Begins Today; December Travel Industry Statistics</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Mobilization Team of the China Aviation Association has received excellent results in collecting National Salvation Aviation Funds from various industries, as reported in various newspapers. The Chinese and Western restaurant industry in this city, to support the mobilization, suggested to the team that they send cadres Zhang Yuliang and Zhang Xiamin to negotiate. They also convened a meeting of all the restaurants in the city to discuss collection methods, deciding to collect 1% of the National Salvation Aviation Fund based on business income standards. For example, a banquet fee of one yuan or more would be charged one cent; half a yuan or more but less than one yuan would also be charged one cent; and less than half a yuan would be exempt. The set amount was 100,000 yuan in national currency, and Zhang Tongsheng was hired as the captain of Collection Team 450, with Wang Wenkui, Cheng Shuzhi, Yu Wenxuan, Shi Meiqing, and thirty-three others as deputy captains to assist in the process. Originally scheduled to start on January 15, the industry requested a change, as that time coincided with the end of the lunar year, when restaurants were busy settling accounts and closing. The start date was changed to today (February 1), with the approval of the headquarters office.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Captain's Office convened a discussion meeting for the staff collecting National Salvation Aviation Funds from the private shipping industry at the office at 4:30 PM on the 29th. Attendees included Yu Xianting, Sheng Gongshi, Zhou Shixia, Shen Zuze, Zhu Shengyang, Fan Haishan, and twenty-two others. The meeting was chaired by Li Dachao, the chief executive of the office, who reported on the importance of the National Salvation Aviation Movement, hoping that all staff would recognize the national position, work hard, be humble in their attitude when collecting donations, use gentle language, and promote cooperation and unity in the private shipping industry. He also hoped that all collectors would be diligent, endure hardships, and serve sincerely. Then, cadres from each district reported on the progress of their work. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau Notice: Investigating the Performance of Smoking Cessation Hospitals; Encouraging Excellent Performers and Designating Them as Smoking Cessation Centers</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau issued a notice stating that since the strict enforcement of the smoking ban in this city, many smokers throughout the city, awed by the severity of the law, have awakened and are willing to quit smoking voluntarily. In addition to the smokers who have applied to be sent to the Municipal Huhang South and North Smoking Cessation Hospitals for free treatment, for whom detailed statistics are already available, the Bureau has no way of knowing the number of people who have paid to quit smoking at various public and private hospitals and with Chinese and Western doctors. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate and collect statistics. Previously, two types of survey forms for smoking cessation work by public and private hospitals and Chinese and Western doctors in Shanghai were prepared and sent to the Health Bureau for distribution and deadline submission. This notice is now issued to inform all public and private hospitals and Chinese and Western doctors who have not yet received the forms to quickly come to the Fourth Section of the Bureau or send a letter to request the forms, fill them out separately, and submit them. Based on the reports, the Bureau will review the smoking cessation performance and, if it is truly excellent, will immediately send a letter to the Health Bureau to designate the hospital as an official smoking cessation center for smokers, or request the Municipal Government to award certificates of commendation as encouragement. Please do not delay. This notice is hereby issued.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County smokers' new registration deadline was the end of January, and the general inspection was to be implemented starting in February.

<h3>Two Railway Bureaus to Implement Joint Transportation of Small Parcels Starting Today</h3>
<p>The Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Administrations will implement the joint transportation of small parcels starting on February 21st of this year. The ten provisional measures for the joint transportation of small parcels on the railway are extracted below:</p>
<p>Article 1: All joint transportation parcels weighing no more than 20 kilograms or with a volume of no more than 100 cubic decimeters may be transported as small joint transportation parcels on the Huping, Pingpu, and other special express trains. However, if the luggage compartments of these special express trains are crowded, luggage should be given priority.</p>
<p>Article 2: For joint transportation small parcels transported by rail within a distance of 1,100 kilometers, the freight will be calculated according to ordinary parcel rates. For distances exceeding 1,100 kilometers, the excess will be charged as 1,100 kilometers. The collected freight will be distributed proportionally based on the mileage of each route.</p>
<p>Article 3: The weight of joint transportation small parcels will be calculated in increments of one kilogram. Any fraction of a kilogram will also be counted as one kilogram. For lightweight parcels with a volume of less than 100 cubic decimeters, the freight will be calculated based on the actual weight. However, parcels with a volume exceeding 100 cubic decimeters should be handled according to ordinary parcel procedures.</p>
<p>Article 4: Joint transportation small parcels are exempt from loading and unloading fees. The ferry fee across the Yangtze River in the capital will be charged at half the rate of ordinary parcels, with a minimum charge of five cents.</p>
<p>Article 5: The parcel receipt for joint transportation small parcels may be sent by the railway free of charge to the recipient, but only if the recipient's address is within the urban area of the arrival station. If the address is outside the urban area, the parcel receipt should be sent by the sender to the recipient.</p>
<p>Article 6: Ordinary joint transportation parcel tickets should be used for joint transportation small parcels, but they must be kept in a separate register and not mixed with ordinary parcel tickets. The words "Joint Transportation Small Parcel" should be stamped in red ink horizontally on the upper left of the ticket and the register for identification. If the first copy (receipt) is sent by the railway, the detailed address of the recipient should be filled in on the ticket, and the dispatcher at the originating station should fill out a "Return Receipt for Joint Transportation Small Parcel" for the sender.</p>
<p>Article 7: The originating station should place the return receipt for the joint transportation small parcel receipt in an ordinary envelope, stamp the envelope with the "Return Receipt for Joint Transportation Small Parcel" stamp, and indicate the receipt number and number of pages. The envelope should be handed over to the passenger train conductor transporting the parcel for signature.</p>
<p>Article 8: After receiving the joint transportation small parcel receipt, the arrival station should immediately send a messenger to deliver it to the recipient according to the address, and prepare a "Receipt for Recipient" for the recipient to stamp and return for filing. The recipient should stamp the parcel receipt with the same seal when picking up the parcel at the station. However, if the recipient has a telephone and a seal registered with the station, they may be notified by telephone to bring their seal to the station. After the station verifies that it matches the registered seal, they may receive the receipt and pick up the parcel.</p>
<p>Article 9: If the railway cannot deliver the joint transportation small parcel receipt on behalf of the customer, or if the sender does not wish to have the railway deliver it, the ordinary joint transportation parcel ticket procedures should still be followed.</p>
<p>Article 10: All railway regulations apply to this procedure unless otherwise specified.</p>
<h3>Two Railway Bureaus Abolish Deductions and Savings for Loading and Unloading Workers; Saved Funds to Be Returned</h3>
<p>The Jinghu Railway North Station loading and unloading work was previously managed by the two railway bureaus themselves, according to the Provisional Measures for the Management of Loading and Unloading Workers at the Station. It was stipulated that 5% of the loading and unloading fees would be used for savings for all workers. Now, the workers have expressed that it is very difficult to maintain their livelihoods with the wages they receive, and they have requested that the savings be abolished and that the saved funds be returned. The Railway Bureau's Transportation Department has approved the abolition of deductions starting in January, and all saved funds will be returned to show compassion.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Fuxing National Goods Company to Hold Second Clearance Sale Starting Today; Ningbo Bank Depositors Eager to Invest</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fuxing National Goods Company, located opposite the Hong Miao Temple on Nanjing Road, began selling off inventory on January 9th to repay debts to the landlord and upstream suppliers. Due to low prices, business has been very prosperous. The company now announces that although most of the debts have been cleared, the debts to Ningbo Bank should also be repaid in order to clear all debts and reorganize for revival. The Fuxing National Goods Company Committee has decided to hold a second major clearance sale starting today (February 1st), selling the third batch of goods of various colors, such as silks, woolens, furs, various cotton textiles, electrical materials, and cosmetics, which have just been unsealed by the court, at a discount of 70% to 90% off the original price for cash payment, in order to repay the debts to Ningbo Bank. It is heard that depositors of the Ningbo Bank, seeing the incredible progress of the company's business, and considering that this year is the National Goods Year for citizens and the government has measures to protect national goods by reducing and exempting taxes, believe that the national goods industry has the hope of revitalization. They have requested the Ningbo Bank Reorganization Preparatory Office to allow them to convert 40% of their fixed-term three-year deposits and 10% of their cash deposits, totaling 40%, into shares of the company, so that they can all share in the profits. This would also show the depositors' enthusiasm for maintaining the national goods industry. The Reorganization Preparatory Office has agreed to accept this proposal and has sent letters to depositors with more than 1,000 yuan to proceed accordingly. Depositors have been going to the office in droves to complete the procedures for purchasing shares in recent days.</p>

<h3>Gu Zhuxuan Appeal Case: Summoning Zheng Rongsheng's Wife</h3>
<p>Inquiring into the Cause of Zheng Rongsheng's Assassination</p>
<p>Zheng's Wife Knows or Does Not Know the Details Inquired</p>
<p>The case of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World Amusement Park, being assassinated involved Gu Zhuxuan, the owner of the Tianchan Stage, who was accused of instigating the assassination. Based on the confession of the criminal Zhao Guangfu, who had been arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment, Gu was arrested by Chinese and Western detectives of the French Concession on September 10th of last year and sent to the Second Special Court. The police department filed a public prosecution against him for the crime of instigating murder under the criminal law. After the trial, Gu Zhuxuan was sentenced to fifteen years in prison and deprived of his civil rights for ten years. Gu was not satisfied with the judgment and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. In November of last year, the collegial panel of the Third Branch of the High Court once summoned witnesses for trial. Because the case was</p>
<p>Serious and Complex Requires Detailed Investigation, the Court Ordered a Reschedule. Originally scheduled to continue the trial on the 28th of last month, the trial was temporarily changed to an investigation hearing because the summoned parties were not all present. Judge Wang Yue presided over the Third Criminal Court and questioned the lawyer Zhu Dianqing, who was present. The original informant, inmate Zhao Guangfu, was brought to the court for verification. The witness Chen Ayi Fu, because of the Lunar New Year, hurried back to Suzhou and was unable to attend. His family entrusted legal counsel Jin Yu to attend the hearing on his behalf and requested a reschedule. All of this has been reported in the newspapers. It is learned that the Third Branch of the High Court is very</p>
<p>Carefully Taking Note of this Case. After the investigation hearing on the 28th of last month, following the change in Zhao Guangfu's testimony, the presiding judge convened a meeting after adjourning, which lasted for a considerable time before it adjourned. As a result, the summoned witness Chen Alin, namely Zheng Chenshi, is the wife of the late Zheng Rongsheng, the owner of Jin Yongxing Rental Shop and Wengui Zhai Candy and Vegetable Shop next to the Tianchan Stage on Fourth Avenue (who was assassinated two months earlier than Tang Jiapeng at the intersection of Yunnan Road and Shantou Road in the Public Concession). After receiving the summons last time, her representative lawyer requested a reschedule. The court granted an extension until 3:00 PM yesterday, ordering Chen</p>
<p>To Attend the Hearing. Yesterday, on the due date, Chen Alin, namely Zheng Chenshi, accompanied by legal counsel Jin Yu, arrived at the Third Branch of the High Court on time to report and await instructions. At 3:00 PM, Judge Wang Yue, accompanied by court clerk Wu Jiayu, arrived at the Fifth Court, ordering Chen Alin to the stand. First, they inquired about her name, age, and origin. Chen Alin stated that she was 43 years old, from Suzhou, and resided in Zhilanfang, Kaiyuer Road, Baxianqiao. After the inquiry, the official said to Chen, "Today, I have summoned you to ask a few questions about Gu Zhuxuan's murder case. You should tell the truth and not lie." Chen nodded in agreement. The official then ordered her to sign the deposition and asked, "Who is Zheng Rongsheng</p>
<p>To You, When Did He Die, What Did He Do For a Living?" She replied, "He was my husband. He was shot dead in Shantou Road in the third month of the lunar calendar in the 22nd year. He ran the Jin Yongxing Rental Shop during his lifetime." The official asked, "Did your husband have any enemies during his lifetime?" She replied, "He was a businessman and had no enemies." The official asked, "Do you know that your husband was shot dead?" She replied, "I don't know." The official asked, "Did your husband know Tang Jiapeng?" She replied, "Yes, they knew each other and were always on good terms." The official asked, "After Gu Zhuxuan's case occurred, did the French Concession Police receive a letter? Do you know about it?" She replied, "I don't know. I have never written a letter either." The official asked, "This letter said that</p>
<p>After Your Husband Died, Gu Zhuxuan and Xu Fubao came to your house. The first time they took away 2,000 yuan in silver, the second time they took away 3,000 yuan, and the third time they took away 600 yuan, saying that this money was for killing Tang Jiapeng. You originally wanted to report it, but Gu Zhuxuan and others threatened you not to report it. Is this true?" She replied, "That is not true." The official asked, "At the time, did Gu Zhuxuan say that killing Tang Jiapeng was to avenge your husband?" She replied, "I don't know." The official asked, "What kind of person is Xu Fubao?" She replied, "I don't know him." The official asked, "Do you know Qiu Wanrong?" She replied, "He is my</p>
<p>Husband's Friend." The official asked, "According to the letter, your husband was killed by Tang Jiapeng." She replied, "I don't know."

The official asked, "How much business did your husband do selling fruit in the theater?" She replied, "Yes, the business was very small. The capital was not large. Selling in the theater required paying rent." The official asked, "Gu Zhuxuan borrowed money from your husband and there were three receipts, one for 7,000 yuan, one for 13,800 yuan, and one for 6,200 yuan. Do you know?" She replied, "Yes, there were. This money (referring to Gu)</p>
<p>Has Not Been Returned." The official asked, "Why did Gu Zhuxuan borrow money from your husband?" She replied, "He (referring to Gu) borrowed it to contract out the theater's silver." The official asked, "Have you ever asked Gu for this money?" She replied, "I have asked for it. He said it had already been returned to my husband." The official asked, "If he had returned the money, why didn't he take back the receipts?" She replied, "He said that he and my husband were good friends, so he didn't take back the receipts." The official asked, "Gu Zhuxuan said at the police station that this money had already been returned, and a portion had been crossed out by someone. Have you ever inquired about it?" She replied, "I have inquired about it. It is said that there was no such crossed-out account." The official asked, "After your husband was killed, was the case solved?" She replied, "The case was not solved." Her lawyer also stated to the court on her behalf, "This case has not been solved to this day. We have written to the police station requesting an investigation. The receipts from Gu</p>
<p>Consisting of Three, Have Been Submitted to the Police Station. The police station has issued receipts." The official asked, "Who instigated Tang Jiapeng's death? Do you know? What relationship does it have with your husband being killed?" She replied, "I don't know. It is completely unrelated." The official asked, "Was your husband killed by Tang Jiapeng?" She replied, "No, there is no connection at all." The official asked, "Did your husband do a fruit business or was he a theater owner? Did your husband also have a relationship as an owner with the Great World?" Chen's representative lawyer replied on her behalf, "Zheng Rongsheng was a supervisor at both the Tianchan Stage and the Great World, with security deposits paid. He was not a theater owner." The official asked, "After Tang Jiapeng died, did Gu Zhuxuan come to your house?" She replied, "He never came." The official asked, "Did Gu Zhuxuan have any grievances with your husband?" She replied, "No." The official asked, "Did Gu Zhuxuan have any dealings with your husband?" She replied, "They had business dealings before." At this point, the court considered the questioning of the witness Chen Alin to be complete, and ordered Chen to sign the transcript, announcing the adjournment.</p>

<h3>Xiang Yixing Extorted After Being Frightened; Investigation Reveals Son-in-Law as Instigator</h3>
<p>Xu Ruixiang Arrested and Investigated in Conjunction. Xiang Yixing (also known as Yixin), the owner of Xingchang Iron Works at No. 151 O'Car Road and a native of Ningbo, received as many as ten threatening letters from bandits between October 13 of last year and January 6 of this year, demanding 80,000 yuan. The bandits threatened to use violent means if their demands were not met. Harassed beyond endurance, Xiang reported the matter to various police stations, requesting their assistance in apprehending the perpetrators. Subsequently, Chief Detective Lu Liankui of the General Inspectorate and Detective Qian Xianting apprehended seven suspects: Wei Youliang from Chongming, Wang Jinzhang from Pudong, Zhang Guangen, Gong A'gen, Wang Wencheng from Shandong, Liu Shanshu, and Yang Fuchen. They were detained separately at the Jiaxing Road and Hongkou police stations and handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation, as reported in this newspaper. Later investigation revealed that the instigator of the case was Xiang's son-in-law, Xu Ruixian, a native of Ningbo, who had previously worked at the Xingchang Iron Works. He was found to have negotiated with the bandits several times at the Dragon King Temple in Pudong and was thus implicated in the case. Xu lived at No. 52 Fanxing Lane, Xihua Road in the Chinese district. The Public Security Bureau dispatched detectives to arrest and detain him. The other day, Chinese and foreign detectives in charge of the case formally transferred Xu from the court to the Jiaxing Road police station with an official letter. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, explained the details of the case and requested a postponement to conduct a joint trial with Wei Youliang and others. During questioning, Xu Duanxian confessed that he was Xiang's son-in-law and had worked at the factory for many years but denied conspiring with the bandits, pleading for leniency. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be remanded in custody for a joint trial at a later date.</p>

<p>At approximately 10:30 yesterday morning, two robbers broke into a shikumen residence at No. 8, Lane 15, Haining Road. One of them, speaking Cantonese, entered the living room under the pretense of painting the house. He then drew a gun and threatened the female servants. One of the maids, realizing their ill intentions, sneaked out the back door and called for the police. The robbers, realizing that their plan had been foiled, fled out the front door before they could steal anything. They were met by police officers who had rushed to the scene and arrested one of them on the spot, seizing a brand-new automatic six-shot Browning pistol. The captured robber was immediately taken to the Huishi police station. According to the preliminary interrogation by the police chief, there were other accomplices hiding at No. 106, Lane 921, Broadway Road.

<h3>Verdict in the Case of Zhu Pingou, Clerk of the Municipal Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment. Zhu Pingou, 26 years old, a clerk in the First Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and a native of Zhejiang, defrauded a woman named Qian Gu of 1,000 yuan.

The woman filed a lawsuit, and after questioning by Prosecutor Xie Lian of the District Court, he was indicted. Judge Lu Hongyi held a hearing and concluded the debate, scheduling the sentencing for the 31st, as reported yesterday. At 2:00 PM yesterday, Judge Lu arrived at the Fifth Criminal Court to pronounce the verdict. Zhu Pingou did not appear in court and was represented by Lawyer Zhan Jifeng. The judge rose and read the main text of the judgment: Zhu Pingou was sentenced to six months of imprisonment and ordered to repay the plaintiff 830 yuan. Lawyer Zhan, after hearing the verdict, stated that a crime must have both criminal intent and a criminal act to be established. His client, Zhu Pingou, was only helping a friend and was therefore unfortunate to be caught in this situation. He was not satisfied with the verdict and requested an appeal. The judge granted the request, and the lawyer left the court.</p>

<p>Two Unrelated Individuals Released First</p>
<p>An assassination occurred at No. 63, Tong'an Lane, Matter Hess Road, on the 9th of the month. A man named Lü Zhenming was shot and killed, and a man named Yang Bangjie was injured. After investigation by Chinese and foreign detectives from the Gordon Road police station, it was determined that the case was due to internal strife among gangsters over the distribution of spoils.

Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui opened the Eighth Criminal Court for a continued hearing. Qiu Yifan, squad leader of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, along with team leaders Gao Wansheng and Shen Jinchu, brought a document requesting permission to transfer Qian Jinshan and 14 others, as they were also involved in major cases in the interior. Representatives from the Second Special District Court also arrived to request the transfer of Qian Shan, Miao Diankui, and four other men and women. First, police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that Liu Zuochen and Zhao Cheng, two of the defendants, had no evidence of criminal involvement and requested their immediate release. As for Liu Huaizhen, he requested permission to continue her detention. The remaining defendants were charged with murder and attempted murder. However, the defendants were also involved in the kidnapping of a man named Weng from Yulin Road, which is still under investigation, so he requested a postponement. Judge Liu reviewed the report and ordered the release of Liu Zuochen and Zhao Cheng. The case was rescheduled for a special hearing. He also informed the representatives of the Public Security Bureau and the Second Special District Court that the case had already been prosecuted by the police, and the request for transfer would be considered after the trial.</p>
<h3>Zhuang Jimeng, Recalling Past Litigation, Sues Zhang Zuming for False Accusation; Sent to Second Special Court for Review</h3>
<p>Zhuang Jimeng, the owner of Zhuangyuan Wine Shop, was arrested last summer in connection with a major robbery at the office of foreign accountant Xue Mailuo. Zhang Zuming, a native of Ningbo, testified that Zhuang was an accomplice and had participated in the robbery, leading to Zhuang's detention. Subsequently, the Second Special District Court conducted a preliminary hearing and found that both Zhuang and Zhang were not involved in the robbery, acquitting them. However, the friendship between the two men was shattered. Now, Zhuang, recalling the past events, deeply resents Zhang for making false accusations at the time. Therefore, he hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Zhang for false accusation in the First Special District Court. A hearing had been held previously, but it was adjourned due to Zhang's absence. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan opened the court again. Both the plaintiff and defendant arrived with their respective lawyers. According to Zhuang Jimeng, in his statement, on the night of May 6th last year, he was already asleep when the defendant suddenly arrived with Chinese and foreign detectives from the Hongkou police station and took him to the police station, transferring him to the French police station, accusing him of being involved in the robbery, which led to his detention for many days. He was later acquitted, so he is now suing Zhang for false accusation. In his defense, Zhang Zuming stated that he was first detained by the French police and, out of fear of punishment, implicated Zhuang. Judge Wu reviewed the statements and, noting that the location of the case was in the French Concession, ordered the case to be transferred to the Shanghai Second Special District Court for review.</p>

<h3>Central Savings Society to Open Soon</h3>
<p>Last spring, in order to protect the interests of depositors, the Ministry of Finance ordered award-bearing savings institutions such as the Sino-French Savings Society to be taken over and managed by the Central Trust Bureau. The bureau believed that this type of savings, which is different from ordinary savings, required a dedicated organization to operate independently in order to provide depositors with security. Therefore, it allocated an additional capital of 5 million yuan to establish the Central Savings Society and submitted it to the National Government for approval. The accounting of the society is completely independent. It is now learned that the society will open soon. All old depositors of the Sino-French Savings Society can transfer to the society without any loss. Therefore, the society held a registration of Sino-French Savings Society depositors last winter for verification purposes. In recent months, the number of Sino-French depositors applying for registration has been extremely enthusiastic. However, the registration deadline, which was originally December 15th, has been extended by the society once out of consideration for depositors in remote provinces. Registration can still be applied for now.</p>

<h3>18th Aviation Lottery First Prize Winner</h3>
<p>Li from Yichang Wins Via Mail Order from Great Luck Company</p>
<p>Everyone is Happy with the Prize and Benefit. The 18th National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery was drawn on January 10th, and the results have been published in various newspapers. The first prize, No. 130765, was won by Mr. Li of No. 191, Changkang Road, Yichang, Hubei, who purchased a full set of tickets via mail order from the Great Luck Company at No. 170, Great Road, French Concession, Shanghai. It is learned that Mr. Li is a businessman with a stable financial situation and has been diligently purchasing aviation lottery tickets. He purchases two or three decisions from the Great Luck Company every period and is also a regular customer of the Great Luck Company's mail order department. The 18th period tickets were drawn near the end of the lunar year. Mr. Li was busy with business and thought it would be too much trouble to wire money, so he planned to skip buying this time. However, his maid washed his shirt and found a full set of tickets from the 17th period with the last two digits matching in his pocket. She handed them to Mr. Li, who immediately sent the tickets to the Great Luck Company to exchange for five full sets of 18th period tickets. It turned out that he won the first prize. He was deeply grateful for the maid's loyalty and gave her a bonus of 500 yuan. Although Mr. Li's first prize win was due to the maid's momentary motivation, his consistent dedication was also a factor. The saying "where there is a will, there is a way" is certainly not wrong. Many second and third prizes were sold in Shanghai. For example, the second prize, No. 137580, was won by a few workers from a steel factory in Gaochang Temple who were gathered together by Du Er, a foreman from the Huiliyuan pawnshop in Shanghai. Other second prizes were sold by the Hangzhou branch of the Great Luck Company and the Xin Gonghe Xiang in Shanghai. The Chongqing Junji Company won two third prizes, the Suzhou China Travel Agency won one, and the Wuhu Bank of China won one. All of these were distributed by the Great Luck Company for resale. In addition, the Great Luck Company's retail department also sold two third prizes each. The sales of the 18th period lottery tickets were excellent, so there were many winners. The 19th period tickets will be drawn on February 7th (the Lantern Festival of the lunar calendar). It is a good opportunity to try your luck.</p>
<h3>Pan Xulun's Mother to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The mother of accountant Pan Xulun, director of the Shanghai Lixin Accounting Firm, passed away in her hometown last October at the age of 80. It has been decided that a memorial service will be held first at the Jingtu Nunnery at the intersection of Guleng Road and Tibet Road in Shanghai on February 2nd, followed by a memorial service and burial in Pan's hometown of Yixing on another day. At around 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the steam pipe in the boiler room of the Lide Oil Factory at No. 78, Gordon Road, burst, causing boiling water to splash everywhere. The workers fled in panic, but three workers, Chen Dalong, Wang Yangzi, and Tang Longhai, were scalded on their heads and hands because they were slow to escape. The factory staff rushed to the scene, took the three injured workers to Binlong Hospital for treatment, and then repaired the steam pipe to resume normal work.</p>
<h3>Englishman's Car Injures Farmer's Son; Jin Chengquan Permanently Disabled</h3>
<p>Xia Fulan is Responsible for Medical Expenses. Jin Chengquan, the son of Jin Fuquan, a farmer in Jinshan County, was injured on the morning of September 28th of last year when he was hit by a car driven by Xia Fulan, the deputy manager of the British-owned General Electric Company at No. 23, Ningbo Road, Shanghai, while driving car license number 3117 from Shanghai to Hangzhou. The car was speeding at the Jinshanwei Seawall when it knocked Chengquan down and injured him, causing permanent disability. Because Xia refused to take responsibility, the family sent letters to the Shanghai Bar Association, the Civic Federation, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and other public organizations, requesting assistance. An excerpt from the original letter is as follows: "The civilian was urinating on the road when he was hit by the car. His left leg bone was cut into three pieces by the wheels. He fainted and lost consciousness at the time. The car that caused the accident turned around and fled, but was fortunately intercepted by workers repairing the seawall at the scene. The Westerner could not shirk responsibility and helped the injured onto the car, together with the civilians, and sent them to the Chinese Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road for treatment. At the time, the Westerner sincerely expressed his willingness to compensate for medical and other expenses. However, after being hospitalized for four months, the injury has increased rather than decreased, and his life is in danger. The civilian has repeatedly negotiated, but all have been rejected. The civilian's family is poor, and the round-trip expenses have already cost more than 300 yuan, all of which have been borrowed. We have asked Lawyer Yu Xiangqin to send a letter to Xia Fulan, but we suddenly received a reply from Niumen Lawyers stating that they would only be responsible for medical expenses and nothing else. Now that the injured child's condition is worsening, the civilian's strength is insufficient, and the person who caused the accident disregards humanity and ignores it. We have no choice but to specifically request your association to uphold justice and provide assistance (excerpt below)."</p>

If this custom is not eradicated, it will be an obstacle to public order. (Shooting Stars) A streak of fire releases a shooting star, burning the neighbor's house without remorse. A message to family elders: recognize the danger in this. (Dice) Shouting "one" and "six," openly gambling, wives and daughters indulging in pleasure, everyday family rules, collapsing here. Big gongs and drums, full of street excitement, deafening ears, shaking minds and spirits. Looking back at the rivers and mountains, how can there be leisure? (Scholar Lanterns) Remnants of feudalism, small toys, should be noted. (Firecrackers) A loud bang, piercing eaves and penetrating walls. (Handheld Firecrackers) Mischievous children acting up, startled by a jump. This object has become a custom, a poison of the abolished lunar New Year. (Masks) Dressing up as gods and ghosts, leaping and frolicking wildly, dirty and greasy sticking to the face, also inappropriate. (Good Luck Symbols - Cai Tou) Vegetables can be eaten early, scaring today's prices, four or five hundred cash per catty, one cannot do without buying Cai Tou. (Four Fruit Tray) Not displaying a fruit plate, but competing with a four-fruit tray. The receiver feels uneasy, the giver wastes effort. Maids and young ladies, happily extracting paper-wrapped gifts. (Fruit Plate) Five sweets and three fruits, melon seeds in the heart, piecing together with great haste, rushing to prepare. Receiving respectfully, daring not to pick and choose everything. Selecting conveniently to entertain guests, wouldn't that be more refreshing? (Tea) Tea quenches thirst and clears the mind, how can it be greasy and harm the fluids? Remember the sweetness of the future, reluctantly take it as a spring tea. (God of Wealth) Golden whip and black tiger, majestic aura, arranged in five directions, power in the palace of wealth. With the country poor and the people in distress, this thing has no magical power at all. (General Divine Model) Five saints on the eaves, inviting wealth and profit. House gods and well gods, a pagoda of offerings, a full set of three sacrifices, a cup of turbid wine. Every family has rituals, how can there be so much idle chatter? (Kitchen God) Kitchen god and kitchen goddess, seated in the Palace of Blessings. A thousand bows are ineffective, year after year a cold wok and a cold pot. (Paper Sedan) "Heave-ho, heave-ho," carried up to the heavenly palace. The heavenly palace is distant and indistinct, business thrives for paper craft shops. It is also reported that the exhibition is scheduled to close at the end of this month.

<h3>Fame's Syrup - Affordable and Effective</h3>
<p>Recently, the climate has been volatile, suddenly cold and hot, resulting in coughs that are so severe that one cannot sleep.

From this, it can be seen that the method of taking it is three times a day, one hour after breakfast, one hour after lunch, and at bedtime, each time one spoonful, mixed with half a cup of hot water.

<h3>Basketball Preliminary - Perfect Combination - China's Five Tigers Defeat the Pirates by a Large Margin</h3>
<p>43 to 30 Performance Shows Supernatural Skills</p>
<p>The Pirates Suffer an Unprecedented Defeat in Many Years</p>
<p>Tonight at 7:00 PM, the Two Teams Will Play Again in Shen Garden</p>
<p>The ideal five players of the Chinese basketball team participating in the Asian Olympics,</p>
<p>played the first trial match with the Pirates last night and won by a large margin with a score of 43 to 30, causing the Pirates to suffer an unprecedented defeat in many years. The ideal team initially decided to cooperate, and the performance was already very wonderful. Starting in the second half, the Pirates fell into a chaotic state of no escape. The audience in Shen Garden last night numbered more than 2,000 people. Tonight at 7:00 PM, the two teams will play the second trial match. The crowding of the audience is expected, but the Advancement Association has decided to sell only 1,500 tickets to maintain order in the venue. Each ticket costs one yuan, and the quick-footed can get them first. Referees: Qu Hongren, Zhang Wenyuan.</p>
<p>China's Five Tigers - Perfect Combination</p>
<p>The performance of China's Five Tigers last night was indeed commendable. The two wings, Wang Hongbin and Mou Zuoyun, were extremely agile, entering and exiting the basket, causing the pirates to lose sight of one thing while attending to another. Wang Hongbin was better than Mou. Center Wang Yuzeng was unhurried and commanded calmly, which was even more rare. Wang Nanzhen was also a perfect combination, and Li Shaotang was slightly worse. If this team can be trained for a long time, it may not be so disappointing in Ganlin. The Pirates' tall men completely lost their effectiveness last night. In the second half, the generals were changed repeatedly, but they could not save the situation from collapsing.</p>
<p>Yuzeng's First Touch Opens the Record</p>
<p>China first appeared with the ideal five players: Wang Hongbin, Mou Zuoyun, Wang Yuzeng, Wang Nanzhen, and Li Shaotang. After maneuvering three or four times, Wang Yuzeng touched the ball under the basket and opened the record first. Wang Hongbin followed, making it 4-0. The cheers shook the house. But with a turn, Ryan relied on his height and tied the score under the basket. Carlson's long shot put the Pirates ahead 6-4.</p>
<p>Triumphant Pirates Run Rampant</p>
<p>Mou Zuoyun penalized Carlson, making two out of one, and was able to tie the score again. In the next five minutes, the teams fought fiercely. China's cooperation was not very smooth and there was a slight panic. The Pirates took the opportunity to pounce, Smith scored two consecutive goals, and Skewia and Ryan also increased their scores, so the Pirates took the lead with 13-6. This was the most triumphant era for the Pirates.</p>
<p>First Showing Off the Edge and Taking the Lead</p>
<p>After China called a timeout, they dealt with it again, and sure enough, the clouds cleared and the sky opened, and they gradually got the hang of it and began to show their edge. Li Shaotang attacked from behind, the two Wangs each scored one, and Wang Nanzhen's long shot was successful. China then took the lead with 14-13. The military prestige was greatly boosted. 17-13, White Nat entered to replace Ryan, but the Pirates still did not make up for the difficult situation. China became more and more successful in the war. The result of the first half was 27-18, and China took the lead by nine points.</p>
<p>Lively and Energetic - Pirates Retreat</p>
<p>The second half restarted, Ryan re-entered, and China's Five Tigers were even more active, like real dragons and tigers. Ryan's arrival could not stop China's progress at all. Wang Yuzeng scored one after another, and the score became 34-21. Lagen and White Nat replaced Smith and Bessel. The Pirates had fallen into a state of losing sight of one thing while attending to another. 41-25, Feng Nianhua replaced Wang Hongbin, Feng also added two points, and Liu Yunzhang entered the game and it ended in a blink of an eye. The score was 43-30.</p>
<h3>Inter-City Football Match: Shanghai China Team Defeats North China</h3>
<p>4-0. In the first half, the North team fought with the wind in their favor and had a better momentum. In the second half, the situation changed drastically, and the North team struggled to resist.</p>
<p>Yesterday at 3 p.m., the North China team played an inter-city football match against the Shanghai China team, representing East China, at Shen Garden. Three to four thousand spectators attended. Members of the World Games football selection committee were also present to observe for reference. The North China team's performance yesterday did not seem as brilliant as when they played against the Yonsei University team from Korea. The forwards focused on the center, with too few opportunities on both wings, making it difficult to be active. Therefore, although Wei Lu was good, he had no place to use his skills. Center-back Tan Fuzhen and defenders Zhang Xueyao and Li Qingyu performed quite well, defending against many dangerous balls. They fought with the wind in their favor in the first half, so their momentum was better, but they missed many good opportunities and failed to score. In the second half, the Shanghai China team dominated completely. The North China hinterland was almost completely ravaged. They could only parry and had no power to fight back. The Shanghai China team's five forwards coordinated very smoothly. Chen Zhenhe and Sun Jinshun worked very hard. Cao Qiuting came on in the second half, and although he had few opportunities, his performance was excellent. Several strong kicks were worthy of the audience's praise. The center and fullbacks were also able to fulfill their duties, so they were able to win 4-0.</p>
<h3>China's Fierce Attack Misses Twice</h3>
<p>At exactly 3 o'clock, referee He Chunhui blew the whistle, and the North China team kicked off. The Shanghai team fought against the wind. Sun Zhongshun intercepted the ball and passed it to Gu Shangxiang, who passed it to Xu Jingcheng. He dribbled along the side, raised his foot to shoot, but Chen Zhenhe failed to head the ball in front of the goal. Zhang Xueyao kicked it into a corner. Xu Jingcheng took the kick, but it was saved by Li Qingyu. At the fifteenth minute, Xu Jingcheng took another corner kick. Sun Jinshun swung his iron leg and shot fiercely. Yang Chunying dared not neglect and pushed the ball out of the goal with both hands. Two crises were fortunately averted.</p>
<h3>Yongquan's Fierce Shot Goes Over the Bar</h3>
<p>Tan Fuzhen delivered supplies. Sun Yongquan went deep alone. The Shanghai team's defense was empty. Jiang Shanjing acted like a fierce Zhang Fei, hurriedly catching up and kicking the ball out of bounds. The North China team continued their efforts. Sun Fulai led the army, like a landslide and tsunami, directly approaching the Shanghai position. Yan Chengkuan hoped to score, shooting desperately. Li Ning lost his footing, and Gu Shangxiang followed, but both failed to block it. Sun Yongquan waited for the right moment, but unfortunately, he used too much force, and the ball went over the bar, extremely dangerous.</p>
<h3>Little Xu's High Ball Opens the Scoring</h3>
<p>After surviving a major difficulty, the Shanghai team launched a counterattack. At the twenty-fourth minute, Chen Zhenhe passed a high ball to Xu Wenkui. Xu, from a dozen yards out, turned around and kicked a high ball. The posture was extremely beautiful. Yang Chunying was caught off guard, and the ball shot in from the right corner, opening the scoring. The North China team was eager to avenge their shame and tried to retaliate. The Shanghai team was not satisfied and wanted to score again. Both sides worked extremely hard, going back and forth, but neither side gained anything. The first half ended, with the Shanghai team leading 1-0.</p>
<h3>Old Sun's Iron Leg Succeeds in One Fell Swoop</h3>
<p>After the lemon break, the Shanghai team kicked off. In less than three minutes, Cao Qiuting showed his skills, dribbling deep. Li Qingyu came forward to block. Cao quickly shot from a distance and passed to Jia Youliang, who hurriedly crossed the ball. Sun Jinshun was as fierce as a hungry tiger. He swung his iron leg, and the ball went into the net with a bang. The Shanghai team scored another goal. The North China team was filled with anger and vowed to recover the lost ground. The army pressed on the Shanghai team's position again. Sun Fulai and Yan Chengkuan were like wolves and tigers. Sun Yongquan followed up, a dozen yards from the goal. Sun relied on his accurate kick and raised his foot to shoot. Zhang Rongcai, holding A Dou, threw himself out several feet away. Li Fenlou added fuel to the fire. The ball was low and fast. Zhang Lecai dared not linger and kicked it out with one foot. Sun Yongquan caught up, and the two rolled into a ball.</p>
<h3>Old Sun and Black Coal Succeed One After Another</h3>
<p>Chen Zhenxiang got the ball and moved it forward again. Cao Qiuting used his old trick again. Sun Jinshun, from about twenty-four yards away, swung his iron leg. Yang Chunying was dazzled, and the ball drilled into the net. The Shanghai team's momentum was overwhelming. Cao Qiuting was once injured and left the field. Chen Zhenxiang crossed the line to build a road, occupying the magpie's nest. He shot from the left corner to the center point. Xu Wenkui kicked it into Yang Chunying's hands, failing to score. Cao Qiuting fought despite his injury. Chen Zhenhe, having been lying dormant for a long time, received a pass from Jinshun and gently pushed it into the net in front of the goal, creating a 4-0 situation.</p>
<p>The North Team Was Weak and Struggled to Resist</p>
<p>After this, the North China team's morale declined further, and they barely resisted. Sun Jinshun, Xu Wenkui, and Chen Zhenhe attacked successively, but all failed. Cao Qiuting took the opportunity to steal a camp, but the ball bounced off the goalpost, and the offside was voided. Soon, Li Qingyu committed a foul. Xu Wenkui took the free kick at the center-back line, strong and powerful. Fortunately, Yang Chunying caught it, averting the danger. Time was up, and the bugle was sounded to withdraw the troops. The formations of both sides were as follows:</p>
<h3>Friendly Football: China vs. Korea</h3>

<p>The Korean Yonsei and Chinese football teams will clash at Shen Garden at 3 p.m. today, as a farewell commemorative match for the team's visit to Shanghai. Referee Shen Huichun, linesmen Tan Xi and Liu Chunshu. Yonsei's visit to Shanghai resulted in an initial defeat to the Hong Kong-Shanghai Western United team, followed by a defeat to North China. However, their skills are indeed unique and should not be judged solely by success or failure. In this final scene, they will definitely fight with all their strength. The strong Chinese team should also be extra cautious in dealing with them. The formations of the two teams are as follows: Zhang Rongcai, Xu Heng, Jiang Shanjing, Guan Xun'an, Li Ning, Zhou Guangzhong, Gu Shangxiang, Chen Zhenxiang, Liang Shutang, Ma Junyou; Liu Shizan, Cao Qiuting, Xu Jingcheng, Chen Zhenhe, Zhong Yongshen, Sun Jinshun, Li Yichen, Xu Wenkui, Jia Youliang.</p>

<h3>An Overview of Chinese Elementary School Textbooks Since the Late Qing Dynasty</h3>
<p>This may seem like an insignificant issue, but the very thick borders, the very long book titles printed in number four font, and the so-called "new word" columns, etc., printed in a mixed and disorganized manner in the textbooks are really too unsightly. Naturally, it is right to cancel them. Although there are still a few very conservative publishers who have not canceled these boring things, many publishers have already canceled them. Even the gaps in the textbooks are paying attention to this, which cannot be said to be a manifestation of the progress of educational harm. In short, China's elementary school textbooks are indeed constantly improving. According to someone who returned from studying education in Europe, "China's elementary school textbooks are not inferior to those of European countries." Although this is a general estimate, and a careful analysis may not be entirely true, China's elementary school textbooks have indeed made amazing progress in the past few decades. This is something that anyone who pays attention to textbooks knows.</p>
<p>However, when carefully comparing China's elementary school textbooks with the most advanced textbooks in Europe and the United States, there are still many areas where we "cannot hold a candle" to them. For example,</p>
<p>The most advanced elementary school Chinese textbooks in Europe and the United States have a large number of vocabulary reviews, while Chinese language textbooks in our country have fewer vocabulary reviews. This is because the shape of Chinese characters is complex and difficult to use. Before Chinese characters are replaced with "new characters," it is really impossible to compare with the most advanced elementary school textbooks in Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>European and American elementary school textbooks have more teaching materials, and the illustrations and color pictures are also more numerous and exquisite. Chinese elementary school textbooks have fewer teaching materials, and the illustrations are also relatively fewer and more perfunctory. In European and American countries, the economic situation is better than in our country, and the price of textbooks can be high (some elementary school textbooks in the United States are priced as high as one US dollar or more), so the amount of teaching materials can be increased, and the number of illustrations and color pictures can also be increased. China's economic situation is too bad, and the price of textbooks cannot be too high (the price of an elementary school textbook in our country is probably only one dime in legal tender, and the actual price is less than one-third or one-quarter of the price of an American textbook), so the amount of teaching materials cannot be increased too much, the illustrations can only be fewer, and the number of color pictures cannot be increased. As for the exquisite quality of the illustrations, it is very much related to technology. Naturally, our technology is relatively poor, which is undeniable.</p>
<p>European and American elementary school textbooks have excellent printing and sturdy binding, while Chinese elementary school textbooks have more perfunctory printing and binding. This is related to both economics and technology. Technology can still be improved, but there is little that can be done about economics.</p>
<p>European and American elementary school textbooks can develop evenly in all subjects, while Chinese elementary school textbooks have made the most progress in Chinese language textbooks. The remaining textbooks have made little progress. The social habits of various countries emphasize all subjects equally. The social habits of our country only emphasize Chinese language, so bookstores often only improve Chinese language to create a good impression. The remaining textbooks are not urgently improved.</p>
<p>In addition, there is another strange phenomenon in Chinese elementary school textbooks: almost all subjects have textbooks, not only Chinese language, arithmetic, and general knowledge (or social studies and natural sciences), but even hygiene, art, and manual arts have textbooks. Therefore, children read many kinds of books. The teaching methods of elementary school teachers are not very good, and they only read and memorize by rote, forcing children to read and memorize books all day long, making them too busy. This has created many numb or neurasthenic little citizens. In my opinion, elementary school students in the lower grades only need textbooks for Chinese language, arithmetic does not need textbooks, only workbooks, and general knowledge also does not need textbooks, only workbooks. The remaining subjects emphasize "learning and doing," so there is no need for textbooks. Middle-grade students use textbooks for Chinese language and general knowledge, and the rest is the same as the lower grades, only workbooks or reference books. High-grade students only use textbooks for Chinese language, social studies, natural sciences, and hygiene. The rest use reference books or workbooks, etc. The most ideal method is that in fact, middle and high-grade students can only have Chinese language textbooks. General knowledge, social studies, natural sciences, etc., also use reference books. Each elementary school likes to use many textbooks, probably because they see that bookstores publish many kinds of textbooks. Bookstores like to publish many kinds of textbooks, probably because of business. The so-called "business must be done." Because of business, more textbooks are published. Because more textbooks are published, schools use more textbooks. This is really not a good method. I hope that in the future, bookstores will compile more reference books and workbooks for each subject for elementary schools to use. Finally, I have two more points.</p>
<p>Elementary school textbooks inevitably have crude and shoddy products, but some people, wearing tinted glasses or harboring destructive thoughts, criticize elementary school textbooks, saying that they are not good in this way or wrong in that way, and even criticize the most advanced textbooks so that they are "covered with wounds." This is also not a good phenomenon. I think it is easier to criticize elementary school textbooks than to edit them. Instead of criticizing other people's works, it is better to take out some of your own goods for others to see. At least, you should use a constructive attitude, a truly objective and scientific method, to sincerely state your opinions on how to improve to the editors, without any "distortion" or any other purpose, so that others will be convinced.</p>
<p>China's elementary school textbooks are not yet very advanced, and even the more advanced educational books are not eagerly adopted by the elementary school education community. Therefore, a certain businessman said, "Elementary school textbooks are not good or bad, sales only depend on business methods. Even if good elementary school textbooks are compiled, elementary school teachers may not know the goods, and they may not know how to use them." These words are certainly too harsh, but elementary school teachers do not know how to choose textbooks, or</p>

Japanese banks redeemed over 900,000 in bill payments, various goods, exchange, and miscellaneous payments totaled over 1.2 million, telegraphic transfers totaled over 300,000, and special exchange totaled over 400,000.

<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Cancel Account Transfers; January Settlement Reaches Over 50 Million</h3>
<p>Yesterday, January 30th and 31st were the settlement dates for January futures contracts at the goods and securities exchange. Due to the recent excessive speculation, the authorities, in order to thoroughly investigate the relationships, did not allow brokers to transfer and settle accounts among themselves as in the past. Therefore, the settlement affairs of the exchange became more busy, totaling 52.45 million, of which the unified tax and salt tax accounted for 12.3 million, the most. This settlement, because it coincided with the speculative frenzy, caused market prices to fluctuate greatly. Orders were issued to investigate, and the shorts, both new and old, were required to submit actual goods for all transactions. At the same time, the bonds in the Central Bank, China Bank, and Jiaotong Bank's warehouses were sealed and not allowed to be moved, causing difficulties in settlement and transfer. After resolution through barter, the settlement was handled clearly. As for the situation in January, it first rose wildly, then fell sharply. Since the listing began on November 29th of last year, the market saw rumors of government repurchases due to the long companies' efforts to push up prices. On December 14th, demobilization rose as high as 82.55, and on December 29th, Zhengliu rose as high as 79.2, and the salt tax rose to 57.1. This was still the remaining power of the unified currency system. Yin Rugeng's independence and the autonomy of North China had no effect. Later, due to the large number of Jinbang short positions and rumors of interest rate cuts, the number of shorts increased daily, and rumors of interest rate cut delays also spread wider. As a result, market prices fell daily. On January 28th, the last day of January futures, demobilization fell to 68.65, Zhengliu fell to 67, and the salt tax fell to 49.2. The difference between the highs and lows was 13.9 for demobilization, 12.2 for Zhengliu, and 7.9 for the salt tax. Although it was due to the impact of interest rate cut rumors, it was ultimately due to the excessive enthusiasm of speculators, resulting in the order to submit actual goods. From then on, speculators should retreat, and the market should stabilize, but transactions will inevitably decrease sharply. The following is a list of the January futures settlement and total transaction volume (in 100s of yuan):</p>
<h3>Long Positions Liquidate; New York Stock Market Falls Back</h3>
<p>New Feng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market on the 30th was mixed and tired. Except for gold mining stocks, which rose due to the influence of the congressional inflation faction, most stocks were quite chaotic. Railway stocks once again found the highest peak since 1934, but after the long positions took profits and liquidated, the price returned slightly. California Oil and Indiana Oil tended to rise, while automobiles and appliances fell. Canned goods were weak, and agricultural tools and aviation were sluggish. Near the close, more floating positions came out. Small exchange stocks were mixed, and trading was very smooth. The bond market also saw both gains and losses. The total daily transaction volume was 3.01 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Tea Warehouses Open as Usual; Agreement to Increase Commission by 0.5%</h3>
<p>The member tea warehouses of the Shanghai Foreign Firm Tea Industry Association, which operate Lüzhuang green tea and Qining black tea, include nine companies: Zhong Xin Chang, Hong Yuan Yong, Shen Yuan Yong, Xing Long Ren, De Yong Yuan, Feng Run, Sheng Chang, Gong Sheng, and Yong Qian Ji. Those operating Pingshui Tuzhuang green tea include five companies: Zhen He, Yi Tai, Xie Long, Xie Tai, and Yi Long. Last year's business ended with not much profit or loss. Therefore, each tea warehouse opened business as usual for this year's operations. However, each warehouse, considering the increasing expenses in recent years, has agreed to increase the commission by 0.5%, to 2.5 cents per yuan. Also, due to the unusually tight silver in the Shanghai market last year, which made it difficult to manage funds, there is news that the interest rate on loans will also be moderately increased.</p>
<h3>New York Silk Prices Fall Again; Shanghai Silk Trade Still Difficult to Transact</h3>
<p>Yesterday, New York silk prices fell by another 1 cent (1.815) for spot goods, resulting in Shanghai market sentiment remaining sluggish. As for the Shang silk trade, the prices held by manufacturers are recorded below. Currently, the price for Shen silk factory grade B, 20-22 strips, is 800 yuan. The price for Fengtai grade 13-15 is 900 yuan, and the price for 16-18 is 860.03 yuan. The price for Dancing brand 13-15 is 910 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Spot Sales Lifeless; Yarn Market Lacks Momentum for Rise</h3>
<p>The yarn market was flat in the morning and returned in the afternoon, but the trend was still hovering. As each party's yarn inventory increased and the sales of spot yarn by customers remained lifeless, most parties inclined to sell. However, optimists generally argued that the peak season for yarn sales in spring was still early and there would be hope for development after the Lantern Festival, so the hovering force was extremely strong.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Trading Sparse</p>
<p>Spot yarn opened higher in the morning, with foreign cotton turning higher and large players pushing the market higher the previous day, leading to a tighter market. However, new buyers were not very enthusiastic. Each month rose by 4, 5, or 6 cents. After the second session, news of lifeless spot yarn business emerged, with little activity from the various groups. In addition, market trading was sparse. As a result, each month fell slightly by 1 cent compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon opening, some profit-taking short positions covered, causing the market to tighten and the market sentiment to tend slightly higher. As a result, each month rose by 2, 3, or 4 cents compared to the morning closing price. The following sales were checked: Meiji 350 bales, Yudai 2,000 bales, Senkang 650 bales, Renfeng 500 bales, Yuanyi 300 bales, Tonghe 200 bales, and Xincheng 550 bales. The following purchases were checked: Dachangcheng 450 bales, Dafeng 350 bales, Gengfeng 700 bales, Changfeng 750 bales, Runkang 350 bales, Ruida 800 bales, and Xicheng 350 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices during the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Only 400 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were mediocre. Throughout the day, the various groups purchased a total of 407 bales. The market was calm. The purchase amounts for each group are listed below:</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Remains Stagnant</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially fell and then stabilized. Indian cotton rebounded 200 rupees outside the customs after the excessive decline the previous day. However, the trend of American cotton was flat and tired, further exacerbating the stagnant situation. In addition, the spot gold market was weak, and selling pressure remained intense. Spot cotton opened in the morning. Due to the improvement in Indian cotton, it rebounded 200 rupees outside the customs. However, the state of American cotton was calm, and market sentiment improved slightly. Near-month short positions covered, causing the market price to rise. When shooting at far-month, it entered a tired path. After the second session, the market loosened. Because spot gold was weak and unable to rise, selling activity pressured and fell. As a result, each month fell by 1.5 to 2.5 cents compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon opening, news of Indian cotton unofficial trading only falling slightly by 0.25 cents emerged. Daji continued to bid short, and Ruida purchased, causing the market price to rise slowly. As a result, each month increased by 0.5 to 1.5 cents compared to the morning closing price. The following sales were checked: Dafu 1,900 dan, Senkang 2,000 dan, Hengde 1,200 dan, Yuanyi 2,400 dan, Yuanxing Chang 1,400 dan, Changhe 4,300 dan, Runkang 1,700 dan, and Dachang 1,200 dan. The following purchases were checked: Dafeng 1,200 dan, Daji 6,200 dan, Shenji 1,100 dan, Ruida 2,600 dan, Changyu 1,000 dan, Dachangcheng 2,900 dan, and Xincheng 1,300 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices during the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Shenxin Purchases Fine Velvet</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is still considered high. The Shenxin factory's purchasing appetite is particularly strong, with a source of 1,050 bales of Yaohua cotton.</p>
<h3>Indian Cotton Rebounds with Japanese Purchase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened, and the market conditions were stagnant. Each month fell 1 to 6 pounds. The industry was waiting for the results of the Washington meeting, whether the 1.25-cent loan could be extended and what developments there would be in the Agricultural Adjustment Act, before determining its operating policy. Initially, it fell due to long position liquidation and near-month moving to cut far-month. Later, it rebounded due to industry purchases. In the afternoon, the trend was firm due to strong stock market. According to Johnson, the cotton stabilization corporation has not sold March cotton, and currently still has 178,600 bales in storage. The closing was flat, with spot goods unchanged and futures up 2 pounds to down 8 pounds. British cotton spot goods rose 3 points, and futures rose 4 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to Japanese purchases, but later became tired due to long position liquidation and selling in India. Pingle rose 1.5 to 1.75 rupees, and Omlaha and Bairoxi rose 2.5 rupees. The original telegraph is recorded on the left (30th telegraph):</p>
<p>Also, according to a Bombay telegraph, the opening forecast for Bairoxi cotton on the 31st was $400 rupees, down 0.25 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Statistics of Spot Yarn Sales Last Year</h3>
<p>The total sales volume of spot cotton yarn in the 24th year was 300,395 bales, a decrease of 15,972 bales compared to the 319,923 bales in the 23rd year. Judging from the total volume, there was no major change in the previous year compared to last year. However, there were quite different increases and decreases in demand for each group. The contents are described separately below.</p>
<p>During January and February, Shanghai's financial turmoil was at its peak. Banks and money shops closed one after another, and silver was unusually tight. The needs of all parties were affected. However, in the corner of South China, the absorption of this yarn increased daily. The Guangdong group's total transaction volume for the year was 75,918 bales, accounting for 30% of the total, an increase of 11,037 bales compared to the 64,881 bales transacted in the 23rd year. The Yunnan group's purchases were similar to the previous year. However, due to the pacification of bandits and the stability of the people in the Hunan and Sichuan provinces, the sales field increased greatly. Sichuan's exchange rate stabilized, and commerce was active, and yarn sales improved. The Sichuan group's total transaction volume for the year was 35,995 bales, also an increase of 10,002 bales compared to the 23rd year. The Changsha group canceled the provincial tax on foreign yarn purchases in the local area, making purchases healthy, with a total transaction volume of 22,015 bales for the year, an increase of 8,725 bales compared to the 23rd year. The Hubei area was restricted by foreign yarn, and the scope of yarn sales narrowed daily. In addition, the political situation was unstable. The transaction volume of the Tianjin group was 13,653 bales, a sharp decrease of 15,149 bales compared to the 23rd year. The Henan group also decreased by 10,896 bales. Due to the famine in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces last year, the purchasing power of the inland group was weaker, decreasing by 19,487 bales. As for the spot market price, the range of increase and decrease for 42-count throughout the year was between 88 yuan and 63 yuan, 53.5 yuan to 28 yuan for 20-count yarn, 34.75 yuan to 28 yuan for 16-count yarn, and 39 yuan to 26 yuan for 10-count yarn. Also, the transaction volume in January was 17,569 bales, and in February was 19,071 bales. The peak in the entire year was in March. Major players, Wu and others, vigorously purchased and took delivery, resulting in a downturn in foreign cotton, tight money, and purchases of 20,000 bales by the Guangdong, Yunnan, and Sichuan groups. Tianjin, Henan, and inland bought 15,000, so the transaction volume was 41,312 bales. In April, the transaction volume was 26,853 bales, in May it was 25,004 bales, in June it was 26,863 bales, in July it was 29,064 bales, in August it was 22,206 bales. In September, due to the atmosphere of inflation, there were more buyers, and the transaction volume was 31,294 bales. In October, the transaction volume was 28,919 bales, in November it was 15,458 bales, and in December it was 20,338 bales. The following is a list of the purchase amount for each group over the past 3 years (in bales):</p>
<h3>Grains: Middle Customs' "Keh Hsien" Rice Continues to be Popular</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the "Keh Hsien" rice hoarding households had already lightened their inventories, while the "Keh" trading groups responded again. The market continued to maintain a strong and popular position. If both the late "Keh" hoarders and trading groups become active again, then market prices may rise again. This is because the daily arrivals are only one to two thousand bags, while the daily outflow is ten to twenty thousand bags. Yesterday, the general market opened with about ten thousand bags. Customers included: Xiamen shipping two hundred bags of rice to Guangdong, Shantou shipping one hundred and seventy-seven bags of rice to Hankou, Quanzhou shipping one hundred and twenty bags of red rice to Jiangxi, and Tianjin trading groups initially trying out nine hundred bags of Siamese rice. Although the volume of "Keh" outflow was small, the market showed signs of vitality. Moreover, the local villages were even more eager to purchase. The whole day saw the outflow of six thousand five hundred bags of Jiangxi rice, six hundred and fifty-five bags of Hunan rice, three hundred and forty bags of Shashi rice, and over one thousand five hundred bags of Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo rice. The market conditions were similar to the previous day, except that medium-grade goods from both local and "Keh" sources were slightly firmer.</p>
<p>One Month Flour Settlement of Ten Thousand Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday was the settlement day for January flour. The actual settlement volume for the whole day was not substantial. This was because the factories were very short of spot goods, and no new goods were delivered. Only a portion of recalled goods were available for sale, including nine thousand bags of "Warship" brand and one thousand bags of "Red Blue Car" brand. There was previously talk of Yangtze River flour being settled, but it did not materialize, probably because the procedures were cumbersome and not as convenient as those of local factories.</p>
<p>One Month Miscellaneous Grains Settlement Overview: Sesame Seed Collection Reached a High of Twenty-Nine Tickets</p>
<p>Yesterday, the settlement of miscellaneous grains saw limited wheat deliveries due to low inventory, with only six carloads being settled. Standard bean oil was also limited to only one thousand one hundred dan. However, the settlement of standard Rong sesame was smooth, with twenty-nine tickets collected (each ticket representing twenty-five tons), totaling seven thousand two hundred and fifty tons. Six tickets were delivered by the 6th, five tickets by the 15th, seventeen tickets by the 16th, two tickets by the 23rd, and four tickets by the 26th. One ticket was received by the 10th, eight tickets by the 24th, one ticket each by the 26th and 27th, two tickets by the 35th, two tickets by the 36th, five tickets by the 41st, and nine tickets by the 45th.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firms' Sesame Seed Fell by Nine Hundred Tons, While Soybean Market Conditions Remained Relatively Stable</h3>
<p>Foreign firms' sesame seed had been neglected for a long time because sellers were unwilling to sell at low prices. Although a market telegram of $11.80 was sent out the day before, foreign replies were still off by 30-40 cents, causing some cargo owners to see that it was not easy to force a sale and were willing to sell early. As a result, yesterday's market fell by nine hundred tons, with prices at $11.55 and $11.50, with February delivery dates. These were all handled by British firms such as Jardine Matheson. Soybean market conditions were exceptionally stable. Factory demand was not weak, exports were tight, and cargo owners were also reluctant to sell. The general market sales were handled by oil pressing factories, Nanyang groups, local groups, and Zhejiang province groups, with over twelve thousand bags of various wheel soybeans being sold.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Guangdong White Sugar Opened with Two Thousand Eight Hundred Bags</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slightly looser trend due to the weakening of Customs Gold Units. The association's market quotations for #4 coarse granulated white sugar were: spot goods at $22.70, local warehouse goods at $22.80, and re-export goods at $6.70, all down by five cents. East "MS" mark was at $15.80, and NKC mark was at $16.65, with some transactions. #8 East white spot goods were quoted at $22.25, and re-export goods at $7.15, all down by five cents. #9 spot goods and re-export goods remained unchanged. Local factory refined white sugar #1 was at $21.60, with #2, #3, #4, and #5 sold at discounted prices. The Sugar Industry Cooperative Society also had its tender exchange period yesterday, with three thousand nine hundred bags of Five Rams coarse white sugar at $22.70, with two thousand three hundred and ten bags sold, two thousand five hundred and twenty bags of #2 Five Rams refined white sugar at $21.45, with two hundred and fifty bags sold, and #4 at $21.25, with only fifty bags sold. All remained unchanged. There was a batch of miscellaneous red sand sugar, totaling over one thousand bags, but the price negotiation did not match, and it is expected to be finalized today or tomorrow, with a more relaxed price.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Longkou Vermicelli Reduced by One Dollar</h3>
<p>Longkou vermicelli previously saw an increase in arrivals, softening the market trend, and sales were not very enthusiastic. Therefore, the opening price was reduced by one dollar, with transactions at $26. North standard goods were also sold at $16. The market may weaken slightly further.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Woolen Cloth Red Plates Successively Opened, Prices Higher Than Last December</h3>
<p>Yesterday (this week), woolen cloth red plates were successively opened by members of the industry. Traveling brokers held samples and solicited red plate business. Wide and narrow camel wool, spring thin fabrics, fancy cloth, mixed-color Walter cloth, Yuan Chang plain serge, etc., were first purchased by door and shop groups, but the number was not large. The real peak sales season for spring will be around the second half of the lunar second month. Shunquanlong mixed-color Walter cloth red plate opened at $4.25, Rongtai at $4.40, 918 plain serge at $2.65, Shanghai brand single width at $1.30, and East goods thin fancy cloth at a maximum price of $3.75 and a minimum of $2.65. All prices were more expensive than last December. The red plates for newly arrived goods opened at even higher prices.</p>
<h3>Metals: "Council Iron" Arrivals and Sales Both Strong, Metal Industry Also Inclining Towards Cash Transactions</h3>
<p>The recent arrivals of 200-pound "Council Iron" are still strong. Companies such as the Tongrenju North Warehouse, Middle Warehouse, and Gonghexiang, Daguzhu warehouses have shipments arriving from time to time, but the sales are also smooth, so there is no concern about accumulation. The standard is very strong because of good market sentiment and high arrival costs. The opening price is $33 per box, which is five cents higher than the red plate. According to news from the Metal Industry Association, due to the difficulty of extending credit in the industry, most future transactions will tend towards cash transactions. It is heard that the association is receptive to this idea. Therefore, future transactions may require cash.</p>
<h3>New Galvanized Wire Opening Prices Strong on the Outside, Weak on the Inside, Only About a Hundred Bundles Transacted</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the new galvanized wire red plate, there has been no activity in the "Keh" trade, and even local sales have been low. Therefore, the market is very quiet. Industry colleagues holding goods are secretly weakening their minds. As a result, the opening price trend already shows an external strength and internal weakness. For example, #8 colored is only opened at $8, #10 at $8.15, #12 at $8.60, #14 at $8.75, #16 to #20 at $9.80, and #21 to #25 at $10.09. It is heard that only about a hundred bundles have been transacted.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News: Haikou Red Leather Red Plate Rose by Two Dollars</h3>
<p>Yesterday, it was heard that arrivals of Haikou cattle leather were very scarce. A check showed that only ten pieces each of Anji red and white leather, and seven pieces of miscellaneous brands arrived on the Qingyuan ship on the 30th. The red plate Sand Red Leather high-grade was at $60, and the next grade at $58. Red Water Blue Leather was in short supply and became popular, with a price of $12. There were many buyers, and the price was two dollars higher than last December. However, sales orders for white leather have not arrived, and the price is difficult to stabilize. Currently, high-grade White Water Blue Leather is about $45, the next grade is $40, and Water Tanned Leather is $32 to $31, with few buyers.</p>

<p>Women's Special</p>
<h3>The Medically Optimal Age for Women to Marry</h3>
<p>— Guo Bolin</p>
<p>Among the various life phenomena that humans possess, reproduction is not something that appears at birth. Rather, it is a characteristic of the ability to procreate and establish a family, appearing in women's bodies when they reach the age of reproductive capacity. Since marriage fundamentally aims at producing offspring, the optimal age for marriage is the age when it is most natural to establish a family and reproduce. However, both parents and society seem to pay relatively little attention to this issue.</p>
<p>Menstruation and Ovulation: As everyone knows, the reproductive age begins with menstruation. When a female is born, she possesses 500,000 follicles in both ovaries. These follicles begin to develop around the age of thirteen or fourteen, and the uterus undergoes changes, leading to ovulation. As a result, menstruation occurs. Because menstruation necessarily requires ovulation as a condition, menstruation is proof that one is capable of reproduction and establishing a family. The average age of menarche in China is fourteen years and six months to fifteen years and two months. Therefore, reaching this age means one can marry without issue.</p>
<p>Optimal Marriage Age: However, during this period, fat deposition has not yet been completed. Therefore, no matter how tight the skin is, possessing radiance and smoothness, forming a beautiful and well-proportioned figure, and completing the body without regrets, all of this must occur between the ages of seventeen and eighteen. After this point, the skin gradually relaxes and loses its luster, and subcutaneous fat deposits unnaturally. Therefore, the most appropriate age for marriage is a little later after the start of menstruation, when the body is completed—that is, between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one, when parents still consider them children.</p>
<p>Late Marriage and Difficult Births: Chirholm stated that the marriage age for women is eighteen to twenty years, but Professor Shi Zhequan stated eighteen to twenty-four years. Why is late marriage after that period not good? It is due to the loss of elasticity in the sexual organs. The uterus, vagina, pelvis, etc., even during pregnancy, cannot change as much as they do in youth, and they cannot fully recover to their normal state after childbirth. Therefore, difficult births naturally become more common. According to Chirholm's publications, prolapse of the uterus and vagina is most common among those who marry late, and the number of births also decreases with later marriage. Today, although the physical development of women is no different from in the past, the age of marriage has shown a trend of becoming later each year. From a medical point of view, this is indeed a regrettable phenomenon and should be deeply considered, perhaps like the issue of working women!</p>
<h3>Soviet Women Workers' Lives</h3>
<p>— Ying Tian</p>
<p>Many years ago, in the Soviet Union, it was rare to see the footprints of young girls in machine factories; but that is no longer the case. Nurturing a spirit of hard work, and possessing robust bodies, these kinds of women workers can be found everywhere. They not only stand firmly in an equal economic position, but also hold a political position in the factory that is no different from that of men. Therefore, people say, "They have the same courage and competitive spirit as men, and have the same status in production as men."</p>
<p>From countless difficulties, they lit a torch; finally realizing their slogan and being completely "liberated." After the Soviet government implemented policies to protect child laborers and women workers, all factories, large and small, desperately developed the number of women workers and improved their lives (reducing working hours from twelve hours to six or seven hours, and establishing many factory schools, clubs, rest rooms, nurseries, libraries, sports fields, etc.). Women workers are never dismissed without good reason.</p>
<p>This is their relatively simple work: everyone is gathered around a long and narrow wooden table, holding a pair of pliers in their hands, assembling small copper wires into a type of machine part. They work without any signs of fatigue. Although this work is light, the monthly salary is about one hundred rubles. Looking at this considerable sum, women workers in other capitalist countries would consider their clothing very luxurious. But in the Soviet Union, they are so frugal: rough cloth worker's clothing, covered with a heavy black coat, is considered sufficient for warmth.</p>
<p>There are absolutely no women workers here who earn only a few rubles a month. In industrial settings, they can earn at least fifty rubles a month. The wages for domestic servants are also worth fifteen rubles a month.</p>
<p>In addition to working six or seven hours a day in the factory, most of their other time is spent on books. They go to school and libraries; some also enthusiastically participate in women's group work. On Saturday afternoons, they have time to rest; everyone rushes into the club, singing pleasant songs to the music of the instructors. In the evening, there is usually a film or entertainment show, and lectures, etc. The meaning of the club includes "inspiring the wisdom of workers" and "adjusting the lives of women workers." In addition, there is a weekly wall newspaper, where their valuable articles can be found at any time.</p>
<p>If they encounter childbirth, they can enjoy fourteen or sixteen weeks of rest, with wages paid as usual. Some factories even cover all expenses. After the rest period, they put their babies in "nurseries" and continue to work diligently. Those who have not recovered can continue to take leave for several days and still go to the "rest room" to recuperate.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Soviet women workers are progressive and happy; however, their happiness is also due to their struggle through hardship.</p>
<h3>Legal Inequality Between Men and Women in France</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yian</p>
<p>The French, who pride themselves on being civilized and advanced, treat minors, the insane, wives, and mothers entirely according to the will of men, regarding them as the property of men. Most of French law favors husbands. A wife cannot dispose of her property on her own, cannot manage her bank accounts herself, cannot participate in the slightest decision regarding the education of her children, and has no right to sign documents. If she finds her marriage unsatisfactory, she cannot file for divorce against her husband's will. Except in very rare and special circumstances, if a husband commits adultery, even if not committed in his own home, his wife cannot use it as grounds for prosecution.</p>
<p>Conversely, if a husband finds that his wife has committed adultery, he can report it to the prosecutor, who must then conduct an investigation. The judicial authorities' investigation of an adulterous wife is thorough. Article 337 of their code stipulates that any woman who commits adultery against her husband shall be sentenced to imprisonment for three months to two years, while a husband who commits adultery with a woman other than his wife in his "own home" shall be fined from one hundred yuan to eighty yuan. If a husband catches his wife in the act of adultery, he can kill her without breaking the law; conversely, if a wife kills her husband in the act of adultery, she is a murderer.</p>
<p>It is unwise for a French wife to file for divorce from her husband, because during the divorce proceedings, the husband can sell off all of his wife's property and belongings, leaving her with nothing after the divorce.</p>
<p>A wife must obey wherever her husband chooses to live. If a wife proposes separation, the husband can legally beat her, withhold money, clothing, food, and drink, refusing to give them to her. If she disregards everything and insists on leaving, the prosecutor will order the police to escort her back. The husband can open his wife's letters or prevent her from receiving them.</p>
<p>One wife was injured by a streetcar, and her injury required the amputation of a leg. She wanted to sue the streetcar company for damages, but could not proceed without her husband's permission, and her husband had gone to live elsewhere because of an affair. Later, her husband reluctantly gave permission, and she won the case, and the company had to pay damages as usual. But she did not see a single sou, because her husband took it and kept it, which was legal.</p>
<p>Special Report from Our Newspaper</p>
<h3>Liao He Xiangning Indicates the Path for Women to Save the Nation</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Men must save the nation, and women must save the nation even more!</p>
<p>Fight for national survival, seek freedom and equality for China!</p>
<p>Everyone knows Ms. He Xiangning as the wife of revolutionary martyr Liao Zhongkai. For decades, she has worked for the revolution and called for national salvation. She is a pioneer in the women's world and a patriotic heroine. Everyone who stands on the front line of national salvation expresses admiration for her. I met her after the "January 28th" Shanghai War of Resistance. At that time, she held a national disaster painting exhibition, selling all the paintings she had made while living in Paris, with the money used to provide first-line medical relief. In those years, she presided over wounded soldiers' hospitals, rescue teams, comfort teams, etc., causing a sensation. But in the past four or five years, the national crisis has deepened, and the Madam's love for the country has become even more profound, and her spirit has become even more righteous. She has lived in seclusion in a village on Lafayette Road, closing her doors to guests, and it is difficult for outsiders to know her address. Fortunately, Mr. Liu Yazi was able to find her, and I was able to fulfill my wish to visit. She lives in a three-story Western-style house, simply furnished and quiet. Madam Liao greeted me with a "Long time no see!" "Yes, it's been almost four years." So we sat down in the study and began to talk:</p>
<p>"Madam Liao, how has your life been recently?"</p>
<p>"I have always lived a middle-to-lower-class life, and I want to maintain it forever, like ordinary people. Unfortunately, my heart disease flares up from time to time, and I can't do any work, so I decline all outside social interactions. The only people who accompany me are my daughter and nephew. My income is not much, and my expenses are very frugal. Painting is my usual hobby, and I use it to entertain myself and maintain my health. Last year, I sold paintings for more than a thousand yuan, and I can live without worry about food and clothing. I don't want to receive a salary from the country, and I ask myself to have a clear and spotless conscience."</p>
<p>"Madam, what are your recent thoughts on the national crisis?"</p>
<p>"That is extremely painful. I have the heart to save the country, but I have no way to repay it. According to the current situation, peace is hopeless. Only by exerting the heart and strength of the people of the whole country can we face the national crisis together and resist for survival. How can our glorious China submit for a long time?…" When she said this, her tone was very激昂.</p>
<p>"Madam, what are your suggestions for women to save the nation?" I turned to the question of women themselves.</p>
<p>"In realistic China, regardless of men or women, we cannot abandon the real task of saving the nation. Although I do not hold any position in the newly organized Women's National Salvation Association in Shanghai, I express my great sympathy. I have been invited by the association to give many lectures. I summarized a few words: that is, the responsibility of women to save the nation is even more important than that of men. Once a great war breaks out, men serve on the battlefield, and women both follow the army for medical relief and maintain the rear. If two hundred million men all die in battle, there are still two hundred million women left. Among them, apart from the old and the young, the strong pregnant women can give birth and raise these little citizens. At most twenty years, we can still restore the country. So with women, we are never afraid of national extinction."</p>
<p>"Madam, what are your opinions on women's participation in politics?"</p>
<p>"When Mr. Sun Yat-sen was in Japan, he convened the First National Congress and stipulated laws on equality between men and women. Women's participation in politics is a natural right. However, the current government despises women and rarely employs them, and women do not rise up to fight for their position. Therefore, most women who are active in politics now hold only humble positions."</p>
<p>"Regarding women's occupations, Madam, what are your insights?"</p>
<p>"During the current national crisis, all industries and businesses are in a slump. Men are already unemployed, let alone women? Unless the national revolution is completely successful and the economic aggression of imperialism is completely stopped, there will be no way out for women's occupations."</p>
<p>"Madam, what criticisms do you have of the current lives of young Chinese women?"</p>
<p>"In the cities, the general noble young women, whether in clothing, food, housing, or transportation, I think they are too extravagant, lacking the spirit of labor and the patience of hardship. And the women in the amusement parks, you can say that she "businesswoman doesn't know the hatred of national subjugation!" As for the women in the countryside and factories, they are really too pitiful. Who will save them?"</p>
<p>"Modern women's trends are divided. Some advocate striving outward, some advocate managing the family internally, and some advocate a compromise theory that takes care of both. Which direction does Madam advocate women should take?"</p>
<p>"I advocate that women should engage in the national revolution, fight for national survival, and seek freedom and equality for China. So be it outwardly and so be it inwardly."</p>
<p>Madam Liao spoke very sincerely, and the more she spoke, the more energetic she became. In addition to women's issues, we also talked about many other things. I really wanted to ask her for a photo to leave for the readers to admire, but she never takes photos. She only gave me two collections of paintings, from which I selected a picture to be published as a memento.</p>

<h3>Female Conductor</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xia</p>
<p>One of the Professions for Women in Harbin</p>
<p>Women's occupations are now widespread throughout China. In the northeastern provinces, the feudal poison is still rampant, and almost all occupations are monopolized by men. It is really difficult for women to set foot in social occupations.</p>
<p>Today, one of the occupations for women in Harbin is the female conductor (that is, the ticket seller) on large buses. Because initially, the buses in Harbin were privately operated, and in March of 1934, the large buses were taken over by the city. Later, the municipal authorities recruited a group of female conductors specifically to promote women's occupations, and also to attract passengers. Their conditions were only that they were young, preferably between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five, and had a high school education or above. The number of people recruited was one hundred and fifty, and more than one thousand five hundred people applied. As a result, one hundred people were selected, and ten out of ten of them had graduated from middle school.</p>
<p>This event caused a sensation throughout Harbin. On the first day that the female conductors started working, a group of men rushed to see the female conductors and showed a surprised look. They wished their eyes could drill into the skin of the female conductors' faces. There were also many men who came to ride the bus for a while just to see the female conductors. Therefore, the income of the vehicle management office that day became a surprising number. Before long, the occupation of female conductor was regarded by the people of Harbin as worse than that of a waitress, and they insulted them unceremoniously. However, the female conductors had to work for ten hours in the swaying buses, with their ears full of unbearable filthy words. Often the female conductors' feet and bodies were deliberately trampled and bumped, and the eyes of a group of passengers were always fixed on the female conductors' bodies, as if the faces of the female conductors had a miracle that attracted attention. When selling tickets, passengers did not gently hand over the money, but insisted on stuffing it into the palms of the female conductors' hands, and scratched their palms. When the female conductors gave the tickets to the passengers, the passengers would never let go of the female conductors' hands, but would pinch them for a long time. When they got off the bus, the female conductors had to collect the tickets, and their hands would be scratched and pinched again. They also mumbled a series of words: "We spent four cents, we can scratch and pinch our hands three times, and we can see a smiling face, it's really cheap..." Passengers like this accounted for two-fifths. In the first few days, the female conductors had to endure these insults silently. Later, when the female conductors encountered this kind of insult, they questioned the passengers, and sometimes pushed them out of the car. As a result, quarrels arose. Sometimes the female conductors twisted the passengers to the car management supervisor to reason, but instead, the female conductors were given an unfair judgment. Because the passengers were customers, the car management supervisor naturally did not blame them, and the female conductors were greatly rebuked, and some were even fired.</p>
<p>From then on, that group of passengers became even more unscrupulous. However, that group of female conductors no longer dared to say a word, because the ghost of unemployment was frightening them at all times. Therefore, the insult to the female conductors has not disappeared until now.</p>

<h3>The Characteristics of Women in Abyssinia</h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of war between Abyssinia and Italy, the previously unnoticed women of Abyssinia have become news material in newspapers. According to a letter from the "Christian Science Monthly" correspondent in Ajunte, the women of Abyssinia have a very modern spirit. They are very polite in public. Although there is no shortage of beautiful men and women in the capital of Abyssinia, there is very little flirting or showing off between men and women. Women have very high aspirations and are unwilling to be treated as slaves in any situation. They are used to being free. Women all show their faces, bare their heads, and bare their feet. Their clothes are plain and do not use colors or embroidery. The white outer garments are long and reach the feet, but reveal silver bracelets worn on the ankles. Both arms and neck are covered with large white scarves. Men and women are often seen walking together in the market. They are hardworking and able to share hardships with men, such as logging, farming, weaving, carrying things, etc., all working together with men. They do not easily leave men. Sometimes when men go to the battlefield, they follow along. Women riding mules are often seen on the streets. When noble women get on and off mules, servants hold their scarves for them. Men and women in Abyssinia are equal, but there are several things that are very surprising: for example, men must wash their own clothes. This is because in ancient times, women who went to the river to wash clothes in small houses in the mountains were easily taken away by neighboring tribes, so men took over the task. Over time, it became a custom, and men had no objections. Almost all the laundry, cooking, and private servants employed by Europeans in Ajunte are men. Men must also share the responsibility of caring for children with women. All financial matters of men must be discussed with women. Women hire their own male and female servants or purchase slaves. All property is jointly owned by men and women. Women have no private rooms. When guests come to the house, they greet them together with their husbands. When a husband is in the room, he must stand up to show respect when his wife enters. Children who have received education also often stand up when their parents enter the room. White-haired elders have great authority. Women in Abyssinia manage fields and other important businesses. They also run many small businesses, some opening bakeries and some opening coffee shops. Women can sue in court, inherit property, and chain debtors. Queens of Abyssinia have held great power throughout the dynasties. The current royal family originated from the Queen of Sheba, who is the most upright figure in Abyssinian history. During the reign of the famous modern Emperor Menelik, Empress Taitu was his most important assistant. She participated in the war against Italy. It is said that the Abyssinian army's great victory over the Italian army at the Battle of Adwa was due to her strength. Later, when Emperor Menelik lost power, she took over the administration. The successor to the throne was a handsome young man named Iyasu, who was deposed after a short reign because he believed in Islam and had various irresponsible behaviors, which were unsatisfactory to the elders of the country. They chose a woman named Zewditu to succeed him. Abyssinia was very turbulent in the 16th century. Later, the Portuguese overthrew Islamism and placed Abyssinia under Roman rule. During this era, three of the leading figures were queens. They participated in fierce wars and managed the government with their talents, earning great reputation. Therefore, the rights of women in Abyssinia are very great.</p>
<p>Men and Women Issues</p>
<h3>Sorrow After Marriage</h3>
<p>— Ms. Tang Caomin</p>
<p>In my husband's family, besides my husband, there is also a mother-in-law and a younger sister-in-law. My husband treats me very well; only the nagging of the madam and the sharp tongue of my sister-in-law are already enough for me to bear. Whenever I am in front of her, she finds fault with everything I do and always has some criticism. She says to me every day: "I was also a daughter-in-law when I was young. I didn't dare to sit in front of my mother-in-law; I'm not like you, who doesn't seem to have any strength in your legs. You just walk in and put your butt on the chair without regard for the elders in front of you. When you speak to your elders, you should be gentle; how can you talk like you're scolding someone? Alas! Times have changed! Daughters-in-law are more powerful than mothers-in-law now. What rules are there to talk about? Only your husband treats you like a treasure. Our ancestors have long been crying in the ground! This is really a misfortune for the family..." When she said this, I could only endure it silently. After finally enduring it, I would go back to my room and lie on the bed, shedding a few tears. Little did I know that my annoying sister-in-law would not let me go and would immediately come over to eavesdrop. After listening, she would fabricate stories and say that I was cursing her mother. When her mother heard this, she would run to my room and slap the table, scolding me without asking whether it was true or false. I didn't dare to talk back and could only cry more. I didn't dare to tell my husband either, because if I told him, he would definitely say it was my fault. No matter what, he would never say anything bad about his mother and sister. I suffered like this for six full years. My mother-in-law died, and my sister-in-law got married. At this time, the old one was dead and the young one was married, and I finally felt a little relieved. Little did I know that the love between my husband and me had also changed a bit. Because our love was completely separated by our newborn child. The hearts of the two of us were also far apart. With this separation, I, on the one hand, was stable, taking care of the household chores and feeding the child every day at home. He, on the other hand, was not right! He actually took a concubine outside! At first, he wanted to bring her home to live, but fortunately my elder brother came out and spoke, and she was set up in a separate household outside. From then on, he didn't come home every day, and the money he earned was spent recklessly. So when we met, we always fought and scolded each other, becoming like enemies. I could only stay at home alone, relying on a few rental incomes to support my son and me.</p>
<p>Last year, his concubine ran away with someone. He was stimulated by this and finally returned home. He immediately felt that my every word and action was different from before, containing sincerity, and deeply regretted his previous actions. Seeing his remorse, I reconciled with him as before, living a sweet life as if we were newly married. Little did I know that I was born with a bitter fate. After only a few months of comfortable days, he fell ill again. His illness was very serious, lasting only twenty or thirty days and costing a lot of money, and he died!</p>
<p>Now, we are a widow and orphan, with no permanent property (because the house has already been sold to pay off debts), relying only on others to help us make a living. I am also a primary school graduate and cannot support myself; my son is still young. Who can I rely on? Alas! Heaven!</p>

<h3>The Problem of Coordinating Telecommunications</h3>
<p>— Hao</p>
<p>Some time ago, I read in the newspaper the talk of Mr. Jiang Tingfu, Director of the Executive Yuan, advocating adjusting the powers and responsibilities between various ministries and between the central government and local governments to eliminate the malady of conflict and duplication. At the same time, he also advocated his views on telecommunications. Coordinating telecommunications is what all the telecommunications colleagues in our country have been sincerely seeking for many years but have been unable to obtain. Now, it is truly good news for the future of telecommunications that a highly respected person like Mr. Jiang is aware of this and is thinking of ways to realize it! I dare to present the actual situation in detail for reference.</p>
<p>According to the Telecommunications Regulations, all telecommunications operated by the state, except those set up by the naval, land, and air force departments for military use, should be coordinated and managed by the Ministry of Communications. However, in recent years, there have been disputes over the establishment of wireless telecommunications by the Construction Committee, followed by the laying of long-distance telephone lines by various provinces, and the self-establishment of radio stations by non-military agencies. The former has been merged into the Ministry of Communications and has been successfully resolved; the latter two are currently under negotiation and consultation. Here, apart from the issue of national legislation, which need not be discussed further, let us speak from the perspective of the actual situation over the past few years. The above two issues truly need to be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The lines set up for long-distance telephones mostly run parallel to the long-distance telephone or telegraph lines operated by the Ministry. Wherever they go, they compete by reducing prices. Although they are said to facilitate the public, they actually violate the principle of economic construction. The telecommunications business, after decades of operation by the Ministry of Communications, has already taken a rough shape. As long as the local governments assist, the completion of ideal telecommunications transportation equipment is not difficult to realize. Now, the provinces are acting on their own, engaging in redundant efforts in addition to the original construction of the Ministry of Communications, which only leads to divided efforts and increases the burden on the national and provincial treasuries. As a result of mutual competition and checks over the years, they have become a mutually restrictive situation. The telecommunications business operated by the Ministry has been deeply affected, making it unable to fulfill the major mission of completing national defense telecommunications construction; and the local economy also feels heavily burdened because of maintaining the telecommunications business operated by the provinces. Therefore, for the sake of the local governments and for the sake of national defense, the central government should urgently control the overall situation, and all national telecommunications businesses should be planned and managed by the Ministry of Communications. The local governments should allocate the telecommunications construction funds to the Ministry of Communications for expanding the telecommunications construction of the province, or use them for other constructions that have not yet been carried out but are urgently needed at present. In this way, the central government and the local governments will work together as one, cooperate with each other, and treat each other with sincerity. I firmly believe that they will be able to exert great power and greatly benefit the future of the country.</p>
<p>The self-establishment of radio stations by non-military agencies has also been a major problem in telecommunications for several years. It violates the Telecommunications Regulations and damages the dignity of legislation, which need not be discussed. Moreover, it disrupts the order of the airwaves and hinders the entire wireless telecommunications transportation, which is a great obstacle to communication. In addition, it also greatly affects the telecommunications economy. Therefore, in order to maintain legislative dignity, protect telecommunications transportation, and consolidate the telecommunications economy, the self-establishment of radio stations by non-military agencies must also be resolved at the same time.</p>
<p>The above two matters were petitioned for by more than 20,000 telecommunications employees across the country several years ago, hoping that the authorities would resolve them. However, due to the lack of opportunity, their wishes have not been fulfilled. However, they have never forgotten their earnest expectations for the early resolution of these major issues related to the lifeline of telecommunications and the future of national defense. Now, Mr. Jiang's words are like a welcome sound in an empty valley, making them feel even more delighted. It is firmly believed that Mr. Jiang, at a time when he is actively seeking to accomplish something and is in a position to do so, will have sufficient power to promote the realization of this great policy and comfort the hopes of his colleagues!</p>
<h3>Telegram Inspection and Telegram Transmission</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>The effectiveness of telegrams lies in seeking the highest speed of information transmission. All those who send telegrams hold this view and hope that the telegrams they send can be delivered safely in the shortest possible time. It is the responsibility of the telegraph office to provide this kind of service, and it should also transmit telegrams in the most rapid and reliable way to meet the expectations of the senders. However, in fact, there are still inevitable delays. The reasons for this can be attributed to two factors: one is the obstruction of the circuits and the damage to the equipment; the other is the inspection of telegrams. Regarding the former, the occurrence of circuit obstructions and equipment damage is sometimes an unavoidable and indefensible fact. Senders who are aware of this situation can often understand it. Regarding the latter, the general public often has two views: first, that the telegraph office has an obligation to transmit telegrams in the most rapid and reliable way and should not delay them; second, that the people have the right to privacy in communications, which is enshrined in law and should not be violated. Because the inspection of telegrams causes delays or even detentions, on the one hand, it has lost the original purpose of speed and reliability, and on the other hand, it also violates the right to privacy in communications. Therefore, there is often suspicion and blame towards the telegraph office for inspecting telegrams. Indeed, this kind of suspicion and blame is not without considerable reason. However, upon further investigation, it is known that telegram inspection has its legitimate basis, and at the same time, delays or detentions due to inspection are also inevitable facts that cannot be attributed to the telegraph office. This article will briefly explain this point.</p>
<p>First of all, we should deeply understand that the exercise of all rights of the people should be governed by the principle of not harming social public order and good customs. This is recognized by any democratic country. Therefore, whether it is speech or action, the people should not exceed this reasonable standard. At the same time, in order to maintain this standard, the government may also formulate laws to protect it. Therefore, although the law stipulates that the people have the freedom of privacy in communications, it also has a proviso that it shall not be restricted except in accordance with the law. In other words, in principle, the people enjoy this freedom, but in special circumstances, the government may still restrict it in accordance with the law. Telegrams are a form of communication and cannot escape this category. Therefore, the telecommunications laws of various countries have clear provisions giving the government and the telegraph office the power to inspect telegrams in special circumstances. Article 32 of the Domestic Telegram Business Regulations of our country also clearly stipulates that the telegraph office may refuse to accept or stop the transmission of telegrams whose content is deemed to be harmful to public order or good customs. Article 33 further stipulates that when the telegraph office receives coded telegrams and deems it necessary to inspect them during military periods, it may legally require the sender to explain the meaning or submit the codebook for inspection. If the sender refuses to explain the meaning or the explanation is not accurate or refuses to submit the codebook, the telegraph office may stop the transmission. However, the inspection should be limited to special circumstances or military periods to avoid abuse of the power of inspection.</p>
<p>At present, in some areas of our country, due to the relationship of suppressing bandits or due to special circumstances, the local military and political organs often send personnel to the telegraph office to inspect telegrams for the sake of ensuring security and preventing the source of chaos. As a result of the inspection, there are inevitable delays in the procedures, and the transmission of general telegrams cannot be as rapid as in ordinary circumstances. If the inspecting authority believes that the content of a telegram is questionable, it may even detain it. All of this is due to military or political necessity, and the telegraph office is not responsible for it. Moreover, this kind of treatment is adopted by general civilized countries for the sake of the safety of the entire society and the welfare of the public. Senders who understand this principle will naturally not suspect or blame.</p>
<h3>Talking About Methods of Compiling and Translating Telegraph Codes (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xiaohua</p>
<p>—Please Pay Attention to the Advantages of Foreign Language Codes by Chinese Merchants—</p>
<p>Regarding the methods of compiling and translating Chinese codes, the reporter has talked about it in detail in the previous issue of this magazine. Now I will talk about the methods of compiling foreign language codes:</p>
<p>Foreign language codes are codes composed of Roman letters, usually in groups of five letters. In the early years, there were also codes in groups of ten letters, but in fact, they were still composed of two groups of five-letter codes. In order to save telegram fees, the two groups were combined into one code. Speaking of the methods of compiling codes, it is closely related to the International Telegraph Regulations. I remember that the International Telegraph Regulations initially stipulated that foreign language codes must be able to be pronounced, that is, each code must have a considerable vowel, so that the code word can be pronounced. This condition does not seem very strict, but because each code word is composed of two groups, there are often cases where the pronunciation cannot be connected before and after. For example, the two groups Sorch and Thmyl are combined into one code word Sorchthmyl. There are Cathm five consonants connected in the middle, which of course cannot be pronounced. According to the regulations, it must be charged according to the word count, that is, it is counted as two words. However, the senders often say that this word can be used as a pronounceable word according to the language of a certain country. Therefore, disputes often arise between the telegraph office and the sender. Later, the International Telegraph Regulations specifically revised it to at least three vowels in each code word to avoid unnecessary disputes. However, those who compiled the code still felt difficult, because each five-letter code group must contain at least two vowels, otherwise the combination of the two groups will inevitably have only two vowels, which does not meet the regulations. It was not until recently that it was simply revised to limit each code word to five letters, but there are no restrictions. The telegram fee is calculated at 60% of the full price. Therefore, it is much easier to compile codes now than before. It is not necessary to pay attention to how many vowels each word contains. However, for the convenience of telegraph personnel to read and send, it is best to contain at least one vowel in each code group, because the code composed entirely of consonants, the telegraph personnel must pay attention to each letter when sending. If there is a vowel, you can memorize it and send it at a glance, and you don’t need to keep looking at it. The following example can make it clear: Dfwcs (no vowels) Chock (with vowels).</p>
<p>The above is about the basic conditions for compiling foreign language codes. There are also two very important conditions, one is how to avoid errors, and the other is how to find out the correct code word after an error occurs. The first thing to do to avoid errors in compiling codes is to make the letters contained in each code word as different as possible from the other code words. However, in fact, because the 26 letters are used to compile a lot of code words, it is of course impossible to make the letters contained in each code word completely different from each other. Therefore, in foreign commercial codebooks, at least two letters of the five letters contained in each code word are different. These two different letters must be carefully reviewed so that they will not be mistaken for another code when sending telegram symbols. For the sake of clarity, an example is given to illustrate: ABABK ABACK The above two code words differ only in the last two letters. The telegram symbols of BK and CL are very different. When sending and copying, BK will never be mistaken for CL. If it is CK and DC, then it is inevitable that there will be errors! This point is very important in compiling codes, because if one code word is mistaken for another code word, it will change the meaning of the telegram. Suppose that the original code word represents "the price is six shillings per box" and is mistaken for "the price is two shillings per box." That will cause a very serious result.</p>
<p>The above said that a certain code word happened to be mistaken for another code word, and the last two letters were completely wrong, which is very rare in fact, because the codebooks used by merchants are mostly purchased and not self-compiled. The purchased codebooks are compiled by experts, of course, special attention is paid to this point to avoid such errors. However, it is more common for each code word to be wrong by one letter, which is also a very annoying thing for the person who receives the telegram, because they cannot translate it into words. Although you can immediately request the telegraph office to send a business telegram free of charge to inquire, it is inevitable that there will be some delays. Therefore, the second condition for compiling codes is to make it easy to find out the correct code, that is, assuming that the code word is accidentally wrong by one letter, you can use various methods to find out the original correct code word. To achieve this goal, of course, it depends on the particularly precise design when compiling the code.</p>
<p>The reporter has seen a codebook with the following characteristics: Each code word contains two vowels and three consonants, the position of the vowels is not fixed, but the two vowels are not connected to each other. Each code word differs from other code words by at least three letters. Any code word can still become a code word if it is spelled backwards. The above three characteristics can make it easy to find out where the error is when the code word has an error. For example, the word ABCAN is wrong as TBCAN. At a glance, you know that there is one less vowel. The position of this vowel is either in the first letter or in the second letter, and the telegram symbols of the five vowels aEIOU will probably not be mistaken for the letter B, so the error must be in the first letter. Among the vowels, only the letters AE are easy to be mistaken for the letter T. First check ABCAN, there is this code word, then check EBCAN, there is no this code word, and then spell TBCAN backwards to become NACBT, check the codebook, there is only NACBA but no NACBE, so you can determine that ABCAN is the correct code word. If the code word is wrong as ADCAN, you only need to check whether there is this word in the codebook first. If not, check which word is the closest, and then spell it backwards, and look for the most similar word in the codebook. From this, you can find the correct code word.</p>
<h3>Model Telegram Delivery Man</h3>
<p>The above example is only one letter wrong. If there are two letters wrong, although it is more troublesome to find, it is not impossible to find the correct code word, because there are not many code words in this codebook (there are more than 2,000), so each word has been carefully selected. In addition to trying to avoid errors, there are many conveniences for finding and correcting wrong words. Therefore, it is not only easier for Chinese business firms or private individuals to compile their own codes in imitation of this, compared to purchasing ordinary codebooks, to keep secrets, but also when they accidentally encounter errors, they can immediately correct them without delaying important matters at all. It is really a win-win situation! (Reporter's note: Using foreign language codes to send telegrams can save telegram fees and reduce the chance of errors. If readers want to study this issue in detail, please send a letter to this magazine and we will provide detailed information.) (End) Model Telegram Delivery Man</p>
<h3>Answering Readers' Questions About Prohibiting Telegram Delivery Men from Demanding Tips</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>In the past, when telegram delivery men delivered telegrams to merchants, the merchants often gave tips, or if they didn't give them on weekdays, they would give a reward during the New Year and holidays. Over time, it became a rule. In recent years, the telegram business has been completely renewed. Telegram offices in various places have published announcements, strictly prohibiting the demanding of tips and suspending them as prohibitions. At the same time, business inspectors and telegram delivery men are added to check and ask merchants from time to time. If such facts are found, the telegram delivery man will be punished immediately. Even if the merchant voluntarily gives a reward, the telegram delivery man is not allowed to accept it and must politely decline. This is a new strategy for various telegraph offices to organize telegram delivery men under the direction of the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<p>Guest: It is certainly not allowed for telegram delivery men to demand or accept tips from merchants. If merchants voluntarily give rewards, why not allow them to accept them? The telegram delivery men work hard all year round, so why should merchants be stingy?</p>
<p>Answer: The Ministry of Communications strictly prohibits telegram delivery men from demanding or accepting tips, not because merchants are not allowed to show favor to telegram delivery men. In fact, giving tips has a huge impact on the business. The reasons why it should be strictly prohibited are answered as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram delivery men are responsible for delivering telegrams, and the telegram fee has already been paid by the sender, so there is no reason for the recipient to pay for the delivery again. For example, the postage for letters has already been paid by the sender, so there is no reason for the recipient to pay for the delivery again.</p>
<p>If tips are given for each telegram delivered, it will become a habit over time. Telegram delivery men will think that this is a legitimate income. Merchants will give it without gratitude, and if they don't give it, they will scold them, which will greatly damage the reputation of the telegraph office.</p>
<p>Once this trend starts, telegrams from merchants who give tips will inevitably be delivered first, and those who don't give tips will inevitably be deliberately delayed. Even if all merchants give tips, the amount will vary. Once the thickness is divided, many malpractices will arise.</p>
<p>For the sake of business competition, merchants will also compete for giving tips. A gives five cents, B gives one yuan, and telegram delivery men will determine the order of delivery according to the amount of the reward, which will have a significant impact on the telegram business!</p>
<p>Telegram delivery men are public service employees and have fixed salaries. They cannot be compared with tea servants. American telegraph office telegram delivery men have a very high view of their personality and are mostly educated at the secondary level, and they are gradually promoted to telegram service equipment personnel. In recent years, telegram delivery men recruited by various offices in our country are also mostly educated at the secondary level. If merchants pity their hard work and give them tips, they are treating them as tea servants, which is degrading the personality of telegram delivery men.</p>
<p>From the above points of view, in order to maintain the reputation of the telegraph office, to increase the speed of delivery, to eliminate the troubles of merchants, to improve the treatment of telegram delivery men, and to improve the personality of telegram delivery men, the Ministry of Communications promulgated the regulations for the management of telegram delivery men and strictly prohibited the demanding of tips, which has a profound awareness.</p>

<h3>Communications Ministry Telegraph Department Entrusts China Travel Service to Transport Electrical Materials</h3>
<p>— Pine</p>
<p>For the convenience of transporting electrical materials, the Telegraph Department of the Ministry of Communications has entrusted the China Travel Service with full responsibility for matters related to the transportation of materials. A contract was signed in December of last year to ensure adherence. The Ministry of Communications has agreed to entrust the China Travel Service or its agents with the customs declaration and transportation of various electrical materials for all telecommunications agencies under its jurisdiction that have established travel agencies or agent offices. The points of convenience in this are self-evident:</p>
<p>Electrical materials are the source for the development of the telecommunications industry. If electrical materials are lacking or the supply is inadequate, even with excellent equipment, clear circuits, and skilled personnel, they cannot be effective. Electrical materials are to a telecommunications bureau what ammunition is to a soldier. If firearms are lacking or ammunition is insufficient, even a hundred thousand brave soldiers cannot achieve victory. Furthermore, the storage and transfer of electrical materials are like the supply department of a military unit. If transportation is not smooth and supply and demand are inconsistent, even storing materials in ten thousand warehouses will be useless. Therefore, the transfer of electrical materials is related to the level of efficiency, just as the transportation of military supplies is related to the success or failure of military operations.</p>
<p>China has a vast territory, and telecommunications bureaus are scattered throughout the country. Most of the electrical materials needed are distributed to major bureaus by the Shanghai storage and transfer center, after a small amount is approved for independent purchase by various bureaus. The major bureaus then transfer the materials to smaller bureaus nationwide. This process of forwarding and receiving takes considerable time, and without fixed transportation methods, losses are unavoidable. Moreover, during times of military urgency or when floods have occurred, roads are blocked, and bandits are a concern. Telecommunications bureaus lack both escorts and transportation experience. Consequently, electrical materials often fail to arrive on time, and the bureaus in need are as anxious as if awaiting the arrival of a life-saving rain. This is not because the transferring bureaus deliberately delay, but rather due to the unsoundness of the electrical material transportation system and the lack of unified transportation agencies.</p>
<p>The entrustment of the China Travel Service to transport electrical materials has three benefits according to the contract:</p>
<p>For all electrical materials to be transported by the Ministry of Communications and its affiliated agencies, except for those with a volume of 3x4x5 English feet per piece, or those weighing more than one metric ton per piece, or those that must be transported directly to Chongqing by ship, the Travel Service shall transport them from the delivery location within three days. For those to be transported to Chongqing, the Travel Service shall transport one hundred tons on the first departing ship after receiving the electrical materials for transportation.</p>
<p>In consideration of the Ministry of Communications' goodwill, the Travel Service shall refund a certain amount to the Ministry of Communications from the commission discount given by the shipping companies, except for two shipping companies that charge 80% of the freight rate. As for railway freight, if the Ministry of Communications' half-price license is used, it shall still be paid at half price.</p>
<p>When the Ministry of Communications and its affiliated telecommunications agencies entrust the Travel Service to transport electrical materials, they may entrust the Travel Service to handle insurance. If an accident occurs en route without insurance, resulting in loss, the Travel Service shall still be responsible for negotiating compensation and returning the freight in accordance with the law. The Travel Service shall be responsible for compensation at the price of the electrical materials lost en route.</p>
<p>The above are the benefits for the telecommunications bureaus. As for the Travel Service, there are also the following benefits:</p>
<p>Business expansion: Since the affiliated telecommunications agencies of the Ministry of Communications are spread throughout the country, entrusting the Travel Service to transport electrical materials is equivalent to expanding its business scope to the location of telecommunications bureaus nationwide. In the future, as the telecommunications business develops, the Travel Service's business will also develop accordingly.</p>
<p>Increased reputation: The Travel Service's handling of travel services has gained the trust of society. Now, undertaking the transportation of electrical materials nationwide will greatly enhance its reputation.</p>
<p>Preferential treatment for escorts: During the period of duty, the Ministry of Communications will subsidize the Travel Service's escorts with a daily allowance of two yuan for travel and meal expenses, as well as round-trip third-class train tickets or ship cabin ticket prices.</p>
<p>Telecommunications is a state-run enterprise, and the cooperation of all parties in the country is essential. The Telegraph Department of the Ministry of Communications has previously entrusted the China Travel Service with collecting telegrams and now entrusts it with transporting electrical materials, demonstrating mutual trust and many mutual benefits. The telecommunications industry is currently in a stage of development, and there are many opportunities for cooperation from all parties. We believe that entrepreneurs with a broad vision will rise to the occasion.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Promoting Domestically Produced Electrical Materials</h3>
<p>— Baozhen</p>
<p>Recently, the following record appeared in the newspapers:</p>
<p>"Customs News: Last year, the net value of imported foreign goods was 919,211,133.22 yuan, the net value of exported domestic goods was 575,808,060 yuan, resulting in an import surplus of 343,402,262 yuan. The total value of imported gold and silver was 10,996,768 yuan, the total value of exported gold and silver was 70,394,397 yuan, resulting in an export surplus of 59,397,629 yuan. Both decreased compared to the previous year."</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that China's import surplus of foreign goods last year reached a staggering 343,402,262 yuan, while the export surplus of cash and silver totaled 59,397,629 yuan, an equally alarming figure. If this trend continues, the exhaustion of China's wealth is imminent. Therefore, patriotic individuals, in order to recover rights and reduce leakage, are vigorously promoting domestic goods to prevent the outflow of silver and to develop domestic industries. This is undoubtedly an economic policy that China cannot afford to delay. Amidst this rapid movement to promote domestic goods, we cannot help but think of the issue of materials for telecommunications bureaus. The huge quantities of materials required by telecommunications bureaus nationwide, such as the paper used for receiving and sending telegrams, and the blue paper strips and blue ink used on Morse machines, the white paper strips used on Baudot machines, the oiled paper strips used on Wheatstone machines, and the copper wires, cables, water lines, galvanized iron wires, insulators, and various telegraph and telephone machines required for telegraph and telephone projects, account for a significant portion of the operating expenses of telecommunications bureaus nationwide. The huge amount of money spent by the Ministry of Communications each year to purchase materials from foreign countries or foreign firms is, of course, also a part of the overall import surplus.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications currently has two agencies, the Telecommunications Machinery and Material Repair and Manufacturing Institute and the Telecommunications Machinery and Material Testing Institute, to handle repair, manufacturing, and testing matters, with a somewhat established scale. As for the manufacturing of electrical materials, although there were plans to establish factories to manufacture the materials needed by various telecommunications bureaus, so that the supply of all electrical materials would not have to rely on foreign goods, due to financial constraints, it is difficult to expand for the time being. However, since China already has domestically run paper mills, the various types of paper needed by the telecommunications bureaus can be manufactured by the mills using domestic raw materials. If the mills can establish a production and sales cooperation agreement with the Ministry of Communications, and design and manufacture various types of paper used by the telecommunications bureaus as much as possible, then the Ministry of Communications will not have to purchase from foreign companies, but rather order from the mills. In this way, the import surplus can be reduced somewhat, which will benefit the overall national economy. It is hoped that domestically run paper mills can pay attention to this and further discuss cooperation methods with the Ministry of Communications. On the paper mill side, business can be expanded and goods can flow smoothly. On the Ministry of Communications side, the source of electrical materials will be domestic, and the supply will not be in danger of depletion. This will not only promote domestic goods but also develop the paper industry, achieving multiple benefits with one action. Why not do it?</p>
<p>Secondly, China has long been famous in the world for producing porcelain, with Jiangxi province being the most famous. A considerable number of insulators are required for building overhead telegraph and telephone lines for telecommunications bureaus. These insulators are also dependent on foreign goods. Since China produces porcelain, if porcelain manufacturers in Jiangxi province or elsewhere can carefully study the function of insulators and their manufacturing methods, it seems not difficult for China to manufacture its own insulators. If there is still a lack of funds for manufacturing insulators, then it may be possible to request the Ministry of Communications to dispatch technical personnel to guide and supervise the production. If domestically produced insulators are of excellent quality, have high insulation, and are practical, they will naturally be adopted by the Ministry of Communications, which will greatly benefit the future of the porcelain industry. This is a hope for domestic porcelain manufacturers to cooperate with the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the overhead lines of telegraphs and telephones are mostly made of galvanized iron wire. These galvanized iron wires are mostly imported, and a certain amount of freight must be added to the price per pound, which is not economical. If larger iron factories in China can manufacture various types of galvanized iron wire (such as number 16 iron wire and number 8 iron wire), then the Ministry of Communications will not need to use foreign goods for the repairs and construction of lines each year, which can block a portion of the leakage, and the domestic iron and steel industry can also find a way out.</p>
<p>The paper, insulators, iron wire, and other items mentioned above can all be manufactured by China's major paper mills, porcelain factories, and iron factories, and their raw materials can also be domestically produced. Telecommunications and transportation are the throat and tongue of the country. Once international warfare occurs, the source of foreign electrical materials is cut off, and if there are no domestically produced electrical materials to supply, the impact will be significant. Therefore, promoting domestically produced electrical materials not only recovers rights but also relates to military communications. Amidst the promotion of domestic goods, this issue of electrical materials should not be ignored.</p>
<h3>Several Things Telephone Subscribers Should Understand</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Telephones are a tool needed for public daily life and have a close relationship with the public. Therefore, the matters that telephone bureaus deal with daily with subscribers are also very numerous. If the following matters are not understood by the public, the relationship between subscribers and telephone bureaus often cannot be very harmonious, and even many misunderstandings can occur. Now, the several things that subscribers should understand are written below:</p>
<p>Regarding fee collection: Telephone bureaus charge each subscriber who installs a telephone according to the regulations and do not have any miscellaneous expenses. All fee collection regulations are published at the beginning of the telephone directory, which subscribers can read to understand. When telephone bureaus collect fees from subscribers, they have formal receipts with the official seal of the telephone bureau and the stamp of the responsible department. However, the quality of people varies from place to place, and it is difficult to guarantee that there are no cases of forging receipts to extort money from subscribers. To prevent such malpractices, subscribers must distinguish the authenticity of the telephone bureau's receipts before paying the telephone bill. As for applying for telephone installation, you can directly contact the telephone bureau. There is no need for other expenses besides all normal expenses. There are often some unscrupulous elements in society who deceive some people who do not understand the procedures for installing a telephone, and take the opportunity to introduce them and charge subscribers a fee. Please pay attention to the public and do not be fooled.</p>
<p>Regarding telephone directories: Telephone directories are published every six months or a year. When they are published, there may be some subscribers whose names have not been included. These subscribers, seeing that their names have not been included, often question the telephone bureau, and some even resist by not paying the monthly rental fee. However, the reason for not being included is not due to the telephone bureau's negligence, but rather because the subscriber had not registered when the directory was sent to publication, or although they had registered, installation had not yet been implemented. Furthermore, after the directory is compiled, it takes a considerable amount of time to be completed by the printing company. New subscribers who register with the telephone bureau during this considerable amount of time are often unable to be added. This is also something that cannot be helped, and it is hoped that subscribers will understand. A monthly subscriber change list will be issued to remedy this deficiency.</p>
<p>Regarding the installation, repair, removal, and disassembly of equipment: When the craftsmen dispatched by the telephone bureau go to the subscriber's home to install, repair, move, or disassemble the equipment, or to inspect and repair the lines, they all have a work order or a repair order. Please ask the subscriber to read it at any time to avoid false pretense. As for the work order, please also have the subscriber inspect the work when the craftsman has finished the work, and sign and seal it. Craftsmen are absolutely not allowed to solicit drinking money from subscribers. It is hoped that subscribers will also not automatically give it. If there are any private solicitations, please report it to the telephone bureau or business inspector immediately for investigation and punishment. Furthermore, if the telephone is damaged and the subscriber needs to pay compensation, it must be carefully reviewed by the telephone bureau, and the subscriber must be notified before the repair, and the name and price of the item must be indicated. The subscriber must pay at the bureau and be given a formal receipt because the craftsmen are only responsible for repairs and not for collecting fees.</p>
<p>Regarding other matters: Some subscribers, due to a lack of understanding of the advantages and disadvantages, often move the telephone, change the telephone, or install an extension without permission, or engage in it hastily due to poor technology, which leads to poor communication. Sometimes accidentally touching the light wire is dangerous. In addition, some subscribers, due to a lack of understanding of the regulations that name changes and transfers are free of charge, often change names and transfers without permission, resulting in inaccurate subscriber names and dissatisfaction among callers. It must be known that in order to maintain the telephone service perfectly, the telephone bureau cannot shirk its responsibility, but subscribers must also cooperate fully. It is hoped that subscribers in various places will report the above matters to the telephone bureau for handling, so that the maintenance of the entire telephone organization can be perfected. This is something that every subscriber is willing to help with.</p>
<h3>Communications Ministry Invites Merchants to Undertake Telegraph and Telephone Agency Offices</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications, in view of the vast territory of China and the lack of widespread establishment of telegraph and telephone communications, and the inconvenience for public communication, has followed the example of the Ministry's agency offices and promoted the establishment of telegraph and telephone agency offices in places without telegraph bureaus, inviting merchants to undertake telegraph and telephone communication matters.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the agency office system, hundreds of offices have been established throughout the country. In places near Shanghai such as Xinzhuang, Qibin, Sijing, Qingpu, and Zhujiajiao, which previously had no telegraph and telephone communication facilities, agency offices have now been established one after another, communicating with various places. Other places such as Tongli, Lili, and Wangjiangjing in Jiangsu Province, which are quite prosperous commercially, have also established agency offices to connect and communicate with various places.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned agency offices are all close to the telegraph and telephone main lines established by the Ministry of Communications, so the line connection project is extremely simple. On the merchant side, they only need to find a reputable guarantor to apply for agency. Therefore, the promotion is very smooth. However, the inland provinces have fewer telegraph and telephone railways. Remote places are often far from the places where the lines pass, and a considerable number of poles and lines are required. In consideration of the needs of the local people, the Ministry of Communications often spends huge sums of money to establish poles and lines. Sometimes the people are also willing to provide funds and request the construction of lines and the establishment of offices. For example, Yaokou near Penglai in Shandong Province is an example of the local chamber of commerce donating a large sum of money to request the Ministry of Communications to set up lines for communication.</p>
<p>According to regulations, 80% of the revenue from the agency office's telegraph and telephone fees is reported and handed over, and 20% is retained as agency fees. Other items such as the long-distance telephone incoming call dedicated force fee and the equivalent amount, and the telegraph incoming call dedicated force fee and outgoing translation fee, are also included as agency fees. In this way, undertaking merchants not only seek convenience for local communication but also increase their own business profits.</p>
<p>I have heard that at the beginning of the establishment of the telegraph in Japan, the remote lines in its interior were mostly funded and built by the local people and still managed by the government. The reason for this is due to the needs of the environment and reality. It also shows that the people are clear about the importance of cooperation between the people and the government and are eager to contribute. I believe that under the Ministry of Communications' policy of promoting telegraph and telephone agency offices, the inland people will gradually recognize the importance of telegraph and telephone communication and cooperate effectively with the government to complete the communication network of our country's nervous system.</p>

<h3>Starvation Therapy</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>For indigestion, treatment with stomachics and pepsin is the best approach. However, in remote areas, or when it is inconvenient to purchase medication, there is still a decisive therapy available: starvation therapy.</p>
<p>Starvation therapy is highly effective for children suffering from indigestion. The method involves stopping the supply of food for a specific period to remove the food that remains in the intestines and causes fermentation and decay. The duration depends on the severity of the condition, ranging from a few hours to two days and nights. However, drinking tea and water is not restricted.</p>
<h3>Radical Cure for Nocturnal Emission, a Common Disease Among Young People</h3>
<p>— Yao Erchang</p>
<p>It is necessary to strengthen the reproductive glands.</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission is a common condition among young people, occurring with or without dreams. The primary treatment is to consolidate the sperm. However, consolidating the sperm alone is not sufficient for a radical cure. The cause of the disease is generally due to injury from masturbation, excessive sexual activity, and physical weakness, leading to the atrophy of the reproductive glands. Therefore, for a radical cure, in addition to spermatic consolidation agents, reproductive gland preparations should also be taken simultaneously to nourish the deficiency and restore the reproductive glands to a healthy state. This is essential knowledge for young people suffering from nocturnal emission.</p>
<p>Reproductive Essence</p>
<h3>Restoring a Nocturnal Emission Young Man to Health</h3>
<p>— (Report by Dr. Ren Guoxiang)</p>
<p>The patient, Shang Jiren, suffered from nocturnal emission and insomnia due to early masturbation. He was physically weak and declining. He sought medical treatment, but it was not a radical cure, so the condition recurred from time to time, and the frequency of nocturnal emission increased. Last fall, as his wedding date approached, he was introduced by a close friend to my clinic for treatment. In order to cure the condition, in addition to prescribing "Hymitol" spermatic consolidation tablets to strengthen his sperm barrier, I also instructed him to purchase and take reproductive essence from the Chinese and Western Pharmacy. After taking several boxes in succession, all symptoms disappeared, and he became strong and healthy, like a completely different person.</p>
<h3>Leukorrhea and Infertility</h3>
<p>— Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Combining internal and external treatment yields extremely rapid results.</p>
<p>Inflammation of the female genitalia often secretes a purulent discharge, which is called leukorrhea. This discharge is highly acidic, and sperm are destroyed upon contact. Therefore, leukorrhea is often one of the main causes of infertility in women who have been married for a long time.</p>
<p>The treatment of this condition should combine internal and external methods to achieve extremely rapid results. After recovery, a successful conception can be expected.</p>
<p>Leukorrhea Remedy</p>
<h3>Secret Self-Treatment for Female Hidden Diseases</h3>
<p>— (Report by Dr. Yu Bofu)</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng Renda was known for her health and beauty. Later, due to postpartum imbalance, she became thin and weak, and her beauty disappeared. Various ailments arose, including irregular menstruation and leukorrhea. She repeatedly sought medical treatment, but the condition would recur and was not completely cured. Until last spring, Mr. Zheng Renda accompanied her to my clinic for treatment. I instructed her to purchase and take female reproductive essence from the Huamei Pharmacy to regulate menstruation, restore decline, warm the uterus, and strengthen the body. To expedite the treatment, I also instructed her to purchase "Leukorrhea Remedy" and secretly self-treat at home according to the instructions. After several follow-up visits, the leukorrhea was cured, and her body gradually became healthy. Her breasts regained fullness, and her menstruation became regular again. Last fall, she introduced her close relative to treat a similar condition, and she happily reported that she was pregnant. Counting the months, she should be holding her precious daughter by the time this publication comes out.</p>
<p>(Note) Women should take "female" reproductive essence. Do not mistakenly take "male" reproductive essence. Be sure to specify when purchasing.</p>
<h3>Clinical Records of Sex Disease Treatment</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhan Nianzeng</p>
<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Corner of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road</p>
<p>(1) Premature Ejaculation and Kidney Atrophy Lead to the Extinction of Vitality</p>
<p>The patient, Ni Ziang, is 34 years old, from this province, and in the business world. Mr. Ni, due to his ignorance of health preservation and indulgence in alcohol and sex, suffered excessive consumption, resulting in physical weakness and kidney deficiency, with symptoms such as lower back pain, cold limbs, and tremors. He sought medical treatment repeatedly, but there was no improvement. Business socializing was still not declined, leading to further damage to the reproductive glands and suffering from premature ejaculation and kidney atrophy. Since then, his vitality was cut off, and he lost all human interest. Last fall, he was introduced by Mr. Xiang Hantang to my clinic for treatment. After I performed the latest scientific surgical radio wave therapy, and instructed him to purchase and take "Reproductive Essence" from the Wuzhou Pharmacy, his reproductive glands immediately recovered to the youthful state of his youth. Premature ejaculation and kidney atrophy were treated at the same time, and his spirit was rejuvenated, his cheeks became full, and his body became strong and healthy. All ailments disappeared. Mr. Ni even said that the effect of "Reproductive Essence" was like rescuing him from deep water and fire and returning him to the bridal chamber.</p>
<p>Nocturnal Emission and Smoking Cured in a Month</p>
<p>The patient, Yang Ranxing, is 40 years old, a local, and in the business world. During his youth, Mr. Yang was poisoned by obscene books and mistakenly developed the bad habit of self-flagellation in a dark room, which became increasingly worse. Later, he realized the harm and quit, but he had already suffered from insomnia, nocturnal emission, lower back pain, and back pain. Medical treatment was ineffective. A friend suggested trying opium, which initially seemed effective, but he became addicted. Over time, the opium poison deepened, and the ailments increased, causing even greater pain. He repeatedly tried to quit smoking, but all attempts failed due to various illnesses. Last fall, in view of the strict orders, he decided to come to my clinic for treatment. I immediately instructed him to purchase and take "Hymitol Spermatic Consolidation Tablets" and "Reproductive Essence" from the Zhongying Pharmacy. After taking several bottles in succession, the nocturnal emission was cured, and all ailments were eliminated. Because "Reproductive Essence" can remove opium toxins, the smoking addiction was also quickly eliminated. Now he is strong and healthy, and he is disgusted by smoke, he said.</p>
<p>(Note) Dr. Zhan's clinic is open from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Closed on Sundays.</p>
<h3>Case Studies of Kidney Disease in Clinical Practice</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Erchang, Doctor of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<p>A Case of Leukorrhea and Amenorrhea Treated with Medication</p>
<p>The patient, Mrs. Song Yanzuo, is 27 years old. Mrs. Song suffered from irregular menstruation since her maidenhood. It was not only early or late, but sometimes it stopped altogether, or it surged like a collapse, or it dripped like a leak. After marriage, she often felt uterine cold and abdominal pain, and leukorrhea was persistent. (Omitted) Last fall, she was introduced by Mrs. Lu Zhijian to my clinic for treatment. I instructed her to purchase "Leukorrhea Remedy" from the Chinese and Western Pharmacy and self-treat at home according to the instructions, and to purchase and take "Female Reproductive Essence" from the Western Medicine Department of the Wing On Company. The leukorrhea was cured, the uterus was warmed, and the breasts also developed healthily. Recently, Mrs. Song repeatedly introduced her girlfriend to my clinic to treat a similar ailment, and it was discovered that she was pregnant.</p>
<p>(II) Insomnia and Nocturnal Emission Cause Various Diseases</p>
<p>The patient, Shi Songyue, is 21 years old, from Huangdu, and a worker. In his early years, Mr. Shi was induced by bad friends and mistakenly committed the bad habit of masturbation, flagging every day. As a result, the consumption was quite severe, and he often suffered from headaches, dizziness, insomnia, and forgetfulness. What was most painful was that he often had nocturnal emission at night, with or without dreams. His mind was distracted, and his essence had already been emitted. The loss of essence was frequent, and the deficiency was difficult to bear. He sought medical treatment, but it was difficult to cure. Until last fall, he came to me for treatment. In addition to using radio waves, I also mainly used "Spermatic Consolidation Tablets" with the "Hymitol" mark to treat his nocturnal emission. After taking the tablets, the nocturnal emission was cured. I also instructed him to purchase "Reproductive Essence" from the Wing On Company, three times a day, two tablets each time. After taking about half a dozen, he immediately felt his mind clear and his energy full. He said that he had never been so healthy and strong in his life.</p>
<p>(Note) Dr. Yao's clinic is located on the 2nd floor of the China Trust Company, corner of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road.</p>
<h3>(Letter to the Editor) Quitting Smoking Pleasantly Thanks to Reproductive Essence</h3>
<p>— (Letter from Jiang Hongji)</p>
<p>(Omitted) After I became addicted to smoking, I tried every means to quit due to various inconveniences, but I always failed halfway due to various pains. Last year, because the government was determined to ban smoking, my peers were seeking to quit one after another. I saw that Mr. Yang Wenzhe was cheerful when he quit, unlike others who suffered pain, so I inquired about the whole story. I learned that Mr. Yang took "Reproductive Essence" during the quitting period, so he had no pain and was full of energy and strong. I also purchased and took it from the Taihe Pharmacy. After taking it for about a month, the smoking addiction was cut off, and my weight increased. I was cheerful during the quitting period, and I was disgusted by smoke after quitting. It is truly a miraculous remedy for quitting smoking.</p>
<h3>(Physician Report) Long-Standing Stomach Disease Radically Cured</h3>
<p>— (Report by Dr. Qiao Wenbin)</p>
<p>The patient, Pan Binghui, is 37 years old.</p>
<p>(Chief Complaints) Stomach pain, acid reflux, indigestion, weak stomach.</p>
<p>(Medical History) Mr. Pan engaged in strenuous exercise immediately after eating when he was a student, resulting in injury to his stomach. He often had bouts of pain, acid reflux, and nausea. Food stagnation and indigestion became habitual. The stomachics he took only provided temporary relief and could not cure the condition. As a result, he procrastinated and thought it was incurable. His stomach was weak, and his body was weak, causing various ailments. This fall, he was introduced by Mr. Zhang Guoxiong and came to me for treatment.</p>
<p>(Treatment) After I prescribed "Stomach Pain Remedy" to remove the root of the disease, he immediately felt comfortable and relaxed in his stomach, which he had never felt before. I also instructed him to purchase and take "Stomach Strengthener" from the Huamei Pharmacy to strengthen his stomach. He immediately felt his appetite increase and his digestion strong, and his body quickly recovered to strength. He did not have to take it every day after recovery. Mr. Pan said that it was incomparable to ordinary stomachics.</p>
<h3>(Reprinted Letter) Nocturnal Emission and Premature Ejaculation Leading to Premature Aging</h3>
<p>— (Letter from Wang Fuhai)</p>
<p>I am saved now. Recalling my past sickly state, it feels like another life. Examining the causes of my illness, I can divide them into three. First, congenital insufficiency from childhood. Second, the harm caused by masturbation in my youth. Third, the excess of sexual activity after marriage. This led to suffering first from nocturnal emission, then premature ejaculation, and finally, premature aging. Three months ago, through the introduction of my cousin, Kong Peifeng, I received diagnosis and treatment at Doctor Zhan Nianzeng’s clinic. He taught me the ways of preserving health, applied electrotherapy, and prescribed effective remedies. As a result, my illness was eliminated, and my body recovered. Doctor Zhan, being a skilled expert in sexual disorders, is indeed like my reborn parents. Moreover, "Reproductive Essence" and "Himitot's Semen-Preserving Pills" were instrumental in curing my chronic illness. I should regard them as treasures that saved my life. I believe there must be many others in the world who share similar experiences. I record the whole story to express my gratitude and will certainly recommend them to others.</p>
<h3>(Doctor's Report) The Particularly Painful Symptoms of Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— (Report by Doctor Jia Zhizhong)</p>
<p>Patient: Qian Guozhi, age 39, businessman.</p>
<p>(Chief Complaints) Dizziness, blurred vision, tinnitus, lower back pain, cold limbs, body tremors, night sweats, palpitations, fear of exertion, fear of movement, insomnia, and forgetfulness.</p>
<p>(Medical History) Mr. Qian was inherently weak. During his school years, he became even weaker due to excessive studying. After entering business, he became mentally and physically exhausted due to heavy workloads and constant labor. After the Shanghai Incident, his business was destroyed by the artillery fire, and his nerves suffered a major shock, resulting in the above-mentioned symptoms. He had undergone repeated injections and medication, but without success. Until last autumn, through the introduction of his brother-in-law, Mr. Xie Zonghua, he came to me for treatment.</p>
<p>(Treatment) I observed that his nerves were extremely weakened. I immediately instructed him to purchase and take Reproductive Essence from Zhengwei Pharmacy. After taking several boxes, each symptom gradually disappeared, and his body quickly recovered to health. He was completely transformed.</p>
<h3>Questions and Answers on Diseases</h3>
<p>(Letters must include detailed address and return postage)</p>
<p>Nocturnal Emission and Insomnia: Shen Qingsan asks: I suffer from insomnia every night, which is extremely distressing. I also frequently suffer from nocturnal emission. I have taken various tonics, but without complete success. Please advise on treatment.</p>
<p>(Answer) Your condition cannot be completely cured solely by relying on tonics. You should also take "Himitot's" Semen-Preserving Pills and "Standard's" Reproductive Essence to achieve a complete cure.</p>

<h3>University Students Receive Capital Punishment</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Some time ago, someone loudly proclaimed the bankruptcy of Chinese education, due to the "immoral behavior" of a minority of educators. However, some "gentlemen of the nation" believe that "the morals of society are declining," so even the highest intellectual class is inevitably "influenced" to some extent. This way, scandalous deeds can be attributed to the "morals of society," and education itself bears no responsibility. We must acknowledge their "subtle" and "clever" arguments.</p>
<p>Recently, the Hangzhou authorities executed three kidnappers who committed murder for ransom, and all three of them were genuine university students. This greatly surprised me! University students, by their very nature, have a higher level of education and social knowledge than the average person. At this time, they should be at the forefront of society and be outstanding members of the nation. Considering the environment of university students, their families are likely to be wealthy, or at least not poor. They have no financial burdens or external affairs. They reside in the highest institutions of learning, enjoying comfortable lives. At this time, they should be able to "immerse themselves in their studies," although they may not need to emulate "Su Qin's self-stabbing," they must still "pass" their courses. However, these three university students did not do this. Instead, they indulged in prostitutes, indulged in dissipation, and squandered their parents' hard-earned money. When their own money ran out, they coveted other people's money. Lust and greed occupied their entire minds, and thus they "lost their reputation and ruined their lives."</p>
<p>Does this mean that university students becoming kidnappers has something to do with the "morals of society"?</p>
<p>In fact, the so-called "morals of society" are not like infectious germs that harm people in the same way. Looking at today's university students, how many are truly dedicated to learning? How many spend their days aimlessly, just trying to get a "diploma"? And how many squander their parents' hard-earned money in places of entertainment, indulging in "love talks" and degrading themselves? Whether education is bankrupt or not is not important, whether the morals of society are declining or not is not important. What is important is what do university students do in school? And what does the school administration expect them to do?</p>
<p>A high school sophomore said, "I really hope to go to college immediately." When asked about his purpose, he said that college courses are more lenient, so he can be more comfortable. This is the truth. During the day, going to the university student dormitories, at least two people are lying down sleeping and smoking, at least one person is humming Beijing opera tunes, and at least three people are playing records and learning to dance... This is "another ironclad proof." However, the school administration considers this to be "commonplace" and has no value or necessity to pay attention to. Who should we blame for this?</p>
<p>Indulging in pleasure when full and idle, and resorting to theft when their parents' money runs out, although Hangzhou executed three university students who were kidnappers, the effect of this "warning" may ultimately be limited. It is hoped that they will still think of ways to improve education!</p>
<h3>Footsteps Outside the Door</h3>
<p>— Tianqi</p>
<p>I don't know from which night it started, I heard someone pacing back and forth on the gravel path outside the door. The rhythmic sound of footsteps always clearly reached my ears before I fell asleep in bed. In the cold and quiet night, all sounds subsided, so why was someone pacing there in the cold wind? At first, I was surprised, maybe it was a thief? Or maybe it was a runaway horse from someone's home. Thinking this, I felt a little uneasy, but as I listened carefully, I immediately decided that the sound was definitely the sound of leather shoes rubbing against the ground from someone's calm and unhurried footsteps. If it were a thief, they would never walk so boldly. Therefore, I didn't pay any more attention to it, assuming it was just a passerby waiting for their companion. I fell asleep peacefully.</p>
<p>However, on the second night, the sound of footsteps still echoed outside the cold door, and there was no difference from the previous night. Other than that, there were no other movements. This continued for several nights, and I gradually became annoyed. I thought to myself, if this continues, I won't be able to fall asleep at a certain time, and my daytime spirit will be damaged for no reason. I couldn't help but feel more anxious. Several times, I really wanted to go out and scold this rogue who was disturbing people's sleep outside their door in the middle of the night, and give him a slap in the face to see what he had to say to me. But as I thought this, my weakness was exposed again, and I felt that this was too reckless of an action, and it might not be of much benefit to me. I had to endure and resort to a passive approach: ignore it and focus on sleeping. I tried to minimize my breathing and put my head under the blanket.</p>
<p>This method naturally still failed, and as a result, it was even harder to fall asleep. I was furious. One night, I couldn't stand it anymore. Regardless of everything, I threw on a sleeping gown, opened the door, and was about to shout at him, but when I looked up, I saw clearly under the quiet street light that the person was actually a policeman on night watch in black clothes. He seemed to have heard someone coming out of the alley and was standing there looking towards me. When our eyes met, the anger suddenly turned into a sense of apology. On what grounds could I scold him? At that moment, I really blamed myself for being rash. I usually criticized people for being selfish and self-centered, but I realized that I was no different myself. Moreover, the situation was extremely awkward. Should I greet him? It was really hard to decide. Should I just turn around and go back? Wouldn't this sneaky behavior make him suspicious? I was a little lost.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he didn't seem to suspect that I would do anything strange. He nonchalantly turned and walked away. As his cold back gradually disappeared into the shadows, a gust of cold wind suddenly blew from outside the fence to the north, sweeping across my shoulders. I remembered that I was only wearing a thin sleeping gown and shivered. I took the opportunity to retreat back into the house. By the time I went back to bed, the rhythmic sound of footsteps was passing by outside the door again.</p>
<p>From that night on, whenever I heard the sound of footsteps, I felt infinitely apologetic. If the cold wind and snow deepened, would this watchman still be dragging the sound of his shoes along the gravel path, bearing the weight of life?</p>
<p>Alas, how could I not feel apologetic? I was too comfortable.</p>
<h3>The Owner of the East Garden</h3>
<p>— Xin'er</p>
<p>Getting off the train at Higashi-Nakano, people are immersed in a beautiful garden-like atmosphere. In the gravel paths in front and behind the wooden houses, the quiet and pleasant households, both inside and outside, are clean and relaxed. This mood is what I particularly like. This island must be inhabited by excellent people! After walking for a while, there is the East Garden in front. Pushing open the bamboo fence gate, the sound of the bell tied to the fence door rings clearly and ethereally. This is my friend's boarding house, a rented room. After entering, the owner, a retired soldier in his forties with a gloomy face and a forced smile, said softly and solemnly, Mr. Fang hasn't gotten up yet?</p>
<p>It made me very suspicious. After talking for a while, the owner and the owner's daughter still didn't dare to go in and wake Lao Fang, even though I said I would take responsibility and guarantee that he wouldn't blame the owner.</p>
<p>We sat and waited until the sound of calling came from Lao Fang's room. Then the owner's daughter went in to serve him before inviting me in.</p>
<p>Our conversation turned to the owner. I asked him, is your owner good to you? Lao Fang just smiled and found a diary. He flipped through a few places and told me to take a look, then said, you sit and read, I'll go out and make a phone call to order something to eat. So, I read on.</p>
<p>'When I first moved in, the retired soldier landlord looked at me with his eyes, but rarely spoke to me. I really wanted to move out immediately.'</p>
<p>'The first conversation was about the map. He pointed to the map hanging on the wall and said happily! Isn't it? Japan is so small, China is so big, and the British colony of India is also very large! I didn't want to listen, but his words were too interesting, so I endured it. He went on to boast that he was a meritorious officer who fought in Manchuria a few years ago, and Manchuria is also bigger than Japan, but — glanced at me. I was surprised that he spoke so naturally and grandly, as if this was very reasonable and a kind of justice.'</p>
<p>'The second time he talked about Go and Japanese chess. He said that Go, although originally from China, is now gone in China, but in Japan it has become a great art. As long as you are good enough to reach a high rank, you will never have to worry about food for the rest of your life. Moreover, Japanese chess is unique to Japan. He proudly wanted to teach me, saying that China doesn't have this. However, Japanese chess is exactly like Chinese chess, except that it has a few more pieces, and the pieces are changed from round to pointed. It is still generals, soldiers, elephants, horses, cannons, pawns, and soldiers. The first time he taught me, I, the student, defeated him. My horse moves particularly well. The owner was surprised and called me a genius! I couldn't help but laugh, because it came from Chinese chess, but he suspected that I was a genius!'</p>
<p>'The third time he asked me, frankly: the Nineteenth Route Army is pretty bad, isn't it? He even introduced me to a dish called Ma Zhanshan vegetables, which made me feel even more strange, wondering if I was dreaming. It turns out that two kinds of rumors have already spread here! The most hateful are the Nineteenth Route Army, and the most annoying is Ma Zhanshan. Cutting a kind of vegetable into powder and eating it is called Ma Zhanshan vegetables. We had already forgotten these things, but he reminded me! '</p>
<p>'However, after a month, the situation was completely different. Because I paid for his meals every month, but I always slept until the afternoon before getting up, so I didn't eat a meal, and the owner earned seven or eight yuan for nothing. At the beginning of the month, I first gave the owner forty yuan, and he took care of everything, without ever settling accounts with him. After that, the owner's daughter was also called by her father to serve me. Besides being a genius, the owner is very afraid of me getting angry, which also affects my friends. When friends come, they always have to wait, because the owner doesn't dare to wake me up. I have this weird temper, and if I don't get enough sleep, I'm lawless. However, this is terrible, because I can get angry even better than at home, and I will develop an even worse temper in the future.'</p>
<p>'I haven't heard the owner say: Chinese people this or that for several months! Why is that? The owner thinks I'm a very rich man'!</p>
<p>When I saw this, I lowered my head. Lao Fang came back to the room. He kept shaking his head. I asked him and found out that Lao Fang had asked the owner to make a phone call to order two servings of ham and eggs, but the owner called the phone in a daze, and he came back said there was no such thing. Lao Fang called again himself, but there was still no such thing. It was not until Lao Fang reversed the egg ham into ham egg, that the other party suddenly realized:</p>
<p>'Oh, oh, there are ham eggs!' The owner also muttered for a while.</p>
<p>I looked at Lao Fang, speechless for a moment. Lao Fang was stunned. There was silence in the East Garden. Looking at the elegant scenery outside the window, another kind of taste welled up in my heart, and I felt as if many things were blocking my throat.</p>
<p>And the owner was still asking the genius if he wanted to play Japanese chess!</p>
<h3>The Story of the Villa</h3>
<p>— Hong Ying</p>
<p>Every time I go from the village to Manila to buy goods, I always take old Pukin’s old wagon that is only good enough to be in a museum. This broken wagon is driven by a gray-white old nag with asthma. In this village of about seven square miles, there are only three wagons: Lianluo, Pike, and old Pukin. Because their wagons are brand new, Lianluo and Pike do a good business. Every early morning, before it is fully light, people will knock on their doors. Lighting coconut oil lamps, Lianluo (or Pike) would sleepily wipe the sleep from their eyes with their sleeves, yawn loudly, harness the horse, climb onto the driver's seat, gently flick the whip, and drive towards the village road. But old Pukin’s business was poor. Every week, he could be seen with his face flushed, leisurely biting his pipe, sitting arrogantly on the driver's seat, shouting loudly, and loudly flicking the whip, never exceeding three times. He always thought about that. So every night, on this gentle little street, he would walk around timidly, asking people everywhere</p>
