<p>— 宗亮東</p>
<p>綏遠是我國西北產馬最優的地帶，近幾年來，當局竭力注意馬政，於是在品種和產量上都有突飛猛晋的成績；但是所以有此成績的推動力，則不能不推每年一次的盛大的「產馬比賽會。」此會創始於民國二十一年的秋天，今年已經是第五屆了，每屆的成績都顯出逐年進步的現象。據民國八年陸軍部調查，全國產馬只僅五百萬匹，且後來逐年遞减，到民國十三年僅有一百萬匹，這可見得以前對於產馬事業太不注意，可是從民國二十一年綏省創辦產馬比賽後，遂又有逐年增進的轉向，在沒有舉行產馬比賽以前，綏遠一省進口數字，不過七千七百零一匹，到二十一·二·三年雖逐年增加，然而最高數字僅爲一萬四千零四十六匹，可是到了廿四年，竟達一萬七千一百五十七匹。從這個數量上看，可以知道近年殖產業的繁榮，而這個產馬比賽會就不得不引人注意而極力提倡了。</p>
<p>綏遠產馬比賽會和普通大都會裏的賽馬會不同，一般的賽馬都有些賭博性質，而綏遠產馬比賽則完全寓提倡科學改種方法於半娛樂性中。大會比賽的方式有兩種：其一是「跑馬」走馬」的競賽；其二是「兒馬」（牡馬）「驟馬」（牝馬）的展賽。一方面是從能力上來比賽其體質，一方面是從展覽上來增進其品種。而且在比賽的進行上都是簡要樸實，籌備都由政府當局主持，一切都很周詳公允。因此每屆賽會都是萬入空巷的去參觀，竟有從蒙古草地老遠趕到綏遠來看的。</p>
<p>今年這屆，於金風送爽的雙十節開慕了。雖塞外風雲緊急，然而還能於危急的環境下舉行這樣盛大的賽會，這眞是難得的，尤其是我，初次到西北來，更覺得興奮，好奇地飽了眼福。</p>
<p>會塲是在綏遠新舊兩城大馬路的南面，那是一塊廣大的草原，有十幾頃地，跑道一周有三華里多，大門朝北，那是一座水門汀現代建築的牌樓，上面有「綏遠賽馬塲」字樣，接着一條馬路通到跑馬塲，兩旁新植楊槐，景象很是壯觀。開幕的那天，正是塞上難得的風和日麗的氣候，幾萬觀衆絡絡續續從新舊兩城的大馬路上雲集到會塲裏去，男的女的，老的小的，每個都興冲冲的擠進去。有些「娘兒們」坐着轎車一大串的匯集著，近地的還有拿着板凳，提着飯盒，打算在那兒看整天的。還有從蒙古草地趕來的王爺太太們，身子魁梧服裝奇特的高坐在看臺上。因此平時冷淸淸的廣塲，此刻擠得水洩不通的了。當局事前籌備很周到，汽車階級有停汽車處，此外停人力車處，停轎車處，也都井然不紊，而那擠嚷呌賣的茶食販賣處，也臨時搭起帳幕來，現錢買賣，生意興隆，是他們一筆好收入。</p>
<p>在會場的東北面，有兩座大看臺，中間有座講演台，開幕的時侯，台上滿立着塞北的軍政要人。旗旌，銀盾，馬鞍等各種獎品，眞是把每個觀衆的眼光炫耀得量量的了。參加比賽的馬匹，由騎師牽着在台前聽檢，騎師穿着白字藍底的號衣，戴着由與賽性質而異的各色布帽，馬匹用紅紅綠綠的綢子掛在頸上或結在尾上。每個騎師，心裏都充滿了錦標的慾望，而那精悍超羣，色澤光輝的馬匹，也好像知道追風逐電的競爭，是它無上的光榮。</p>
<p>比賽的第一天，因爲恰正是雙十節，雖然國難嚴重，也都想苦中作樂一下似的，每個觀衆的臉上都顯着新氣象，而那各國來賓，男男女女，也增加不少觀衆的注目。傳主席從開幕到比賽，居然於軍政繁忙中坐了幾個鐘頭。</p>

<p>一九二一年，美國哈定總統和休士國務卿剛才發出了在華盛頓召開裁軍會議的請書，英國便向美國接洽，要在這大會以前舉行英美日三强會議。英政府打算派遣一隻英國戰艦，載着英首相勞合喬治英外長寇森以及加拿大澳洲和紐西蘭各地的總理，渡大西洋進巴耳港，出席三强會議。當時英國的政治家因爲國內對於英日同盟發生爭議的緣故，顯然想望太平洋的主要三强問，議定一個軍事公約，以作裁軍大會的預備。據英國的提議，召開三强會議的目的，是在商定軍事條欵，『倘有可能，則爲二强的未來太平洋政策，在較廣泛的原則上，成立共同的諒解。』一九二一年七月二十七日英國駐美大使革得斯把陳叙着上項計畫的英外交部公函遞交了美國務卿休士英大使還秉承着本國政府的訓令這麼說：『帝國政府對於美日英三國這一種預備會議，不但十分注意，而且看得非常緊要。雖然國會還未閉幕，他們爲要到美國土地上來商討這些問題，郤已預備派遣政府大員渡大西洋來出席會議。」</p>
<p>七月二十七日美國駐倫敦大使喬治哈維發了一個海電到華盛頓，，補充英外交部公函的內容。他說，英國使節要搭乘『高速率的戰艦』來美，預定留件一星期，八月十八日可到，八月二十五日回去。他又說：給英代表團住的高所或是旅館，須有可容代表連同秘書等二十到二十四人，私人僕役十五人的設備。又據寇森的計算，日本代表團需要可以招待十人到二十人的寓所。</p>
<p>這項提議，休士國務卿直截了當地加以拒絕了．他說，美國已經邀請了列國來開會商討關於軍備和遠東事伴的共同問題。英國和其他各國已經在這本旨上接受了邀請。日本對於三强的預備會議、並不顯得怎樣起勁，其他各國必然是要對此感到不快的。休士反對英國提案的態度顯然很堅决，七月二十八日，在發給哈維大使的很長的覆電上這麼說：</p>
<p>『如果在這樣的預備會，商定了條欵，或是採取了什麼操縱大會的行動，大家就會戚覺着大會的結果在事實上是可以預料的。如果因爲意見分歧的緣故，三國得不到妥協，大會就難望成功了』。</p>
<p>休士的訓電上附帶着說：要在巴耳港把招待事宜布置舒齊，『卽使並非不可能，也是困難的』。</p>
<p>休士在那年七月八日，曾經電令哈維大使探察英國人對於所提議的三强會議的見解。那天哈維大使從倫敦來電報告他同寇森的談話。據哈維說，『此間反對繼續英日同盟的感情一天天强烈起來。寇森毫不遲疑地說，任何這樣的特殊布置必然會給我們所考慮的一種諒解所消滅的……』</p>
<p>國務院所公布的哈維的電文有一部分刪掉了。那刪掉的一部分顯然是跟英日同　有關的</p>
<p>國務院又公布了那年七月十八日，英國駐華代辦魯陀克的來電，其中說到中國外交部長顏惠慶對於英國提議的意見。『他（顏氏）以爲英國發起太平洋會議，是要給英日同盟尋求一條可能的出路。顏氏爲要防止這一層，並且確保大會的成功，寗願英國在大會以前受着同盟的牽制』。</p>
<p>那預備會議沒有舉行。華盛頓會議則產生了九國公約和四國公約。遠東問題和裁軍這才獲得了暫時的解决。</p>
<p>當時美政府接到過蘇　的有力的抗議，其中說，蘇聯從報上讀到關於會議的記事；它也是　太平洋的獨立國」不得不要求加入。俄國公文於七月二十一日遞交美國駐瑞典代辦，始終得不到美國的答覆，因爲當時美國政府是不想同蘇聯携手的。</p>

<p>— 星</p>
<p>圖外交之勝利。第一要得策第二要得人。近者吾外交當局對日外交。堅持主權獨立領土完整之原則。可謂得策而人事方面。近來亦有重要之更動。國際聯盟方面。自當選爲半常任理事後。卽任命駐英大使郭泰祺。駐法大使顧維鈞爲出席國聯行政院之中國代表。更任命徐公肅爲日內瓦中國代表團之法律專員。楊蔭溥爲經濟專員。國際法庭方面。自王亮疇氏去職。國聯已推選鄭天錫氏爲推事。美國方面。施肇基大使不日歸國。而以王正廷爲繼。蘇聯方面。顏惠慶大使因病留國。以蔣廷黻爲繼。此項外交新人物。除郭顧兩使已在歐洲外。鄭天錫徐公肅楊蔭溥三氏將於本週赴日內瓦。蔣王兩使亦將於日內分赴莫斯科與華盛頓。諸氏出身不同。閱歷各異。然以其經騐學問。必能勝任愉快。爲外交造成新的陣容也。</p>
<p>中國外交最有關係之地點。除東京以外。莫如日內瓦莫斯科與華盛頓三處。國聯雖非强有力之正義組織。然主持公道。努力和平。終勝於無也。吾人深知依賴國聯爲非計。然運用國聯。使其直接間接上爲我援助。實爲目前外交之不可少工作。中國外交家之蜚聲於日內瓦壞玷者。有顧維鈞顏惠慶施肇基諸氏所謂氏。「中國三騎士」也。自施使駐美。顏使赴俄歐陸方面。外交之重任寄諸郭泰祺與顧維鈞二人。郭顧二氏在外交能力上愛國熱忱上爲國人所信賴。惟國聯事務。百緒千端。經濟財政法律行政諸問題。多技術性質。非經專家之研究。明其與中國利害之關係。則發言者有茫然之感。而偶一不愼。將使國家受莫大之損失。徐公肅楊蔭溥二氏之派遣。其使命爲補救此項困難。代表團之人物整齊。有助於折衝樽俎者定非淺鮮也。至於國際法庭。爲國聯組織之一部份。法官人選。决之於國聯大會及行政院。王寵惠氏去職。國聯推鄭天錫爲繼。使中國在世界法庭中保存一席。法官雖非外交家。然主持正義。判斷是非。亦弱國外交之助力也。</p>
<p>蘇聯美國與遠東關係最深。當此中日關係異常緊張之時。莫斯科華盛頓兩處自宜駐有能力富足眼光卓越之使節。爲國家求外交之出路。顏施二使効忠於外交事業者數十年。其功績道德舉世尊崇。惜年事已高。不勝煩劇。顏已養疴靑島。施亦久思返國。莫斯科方面之外交。决不可以一代辦相應付。而華盛頓使館。與南京外交部不能收指臂之效。更爲外交進行遲緩之主因。今中央允顏施之請。以蔣廷黻王正廷二氏爲繼。蔣以史家爲政。旣開國內政治之新生面。書生膺國家之重寄。出使蘇聯。更當爲外交開一新生面。中蘇關係性質特殊今中日之外交尙甚困難。中蘇邦交。自不宜停留於不决之狀態。至於中美邦交。素甚親善。王正廷氏爲彼邦人士所欽佩。彼之使命除增加中美之友誼外。更宜深察彼邦對日問題所取之政策。朝野之態度及趨向。因勢利導使太平洋彼岸之友邦於吾國之統一建設救亡圖存之願望。有所了解。於可能範圍中有所協助。相時而作。事在人爲吾知王使此行。其意義常不减於常年之參加華盛頓會議也。</p>
<p>憶九一八事件發生之際。吾國駐外之重要館闃爾無人。外交上之失策。莫此爲甚。五年來之敎訓。當使吾人覺悟「弱國無外交」一語爲欺人之談。惟外交陣容不齊整之國。始無外交。外交軍事同爲民族生存之　大保障。今蔣王諸人使放洋在卽。徐楊諸專員亦將登程。政府人民所望於諸氏者甚大。願各努力。以副國家之重寄也。</p>

<p>會場瑣聞</p>
<p>二千男女學生的大會操、是一個偉大的塲面、從各式各樣的服裝中間、好像交織成一幅巨大的圖案、登高遠望、眞是美麗極了、傳得貴賓席上的褚太極等、不住的拍掌、</p>
<p>中國女體師健身活動（順）</p>
<p>初中女生鉛球第一中國女中沈琪先（國際）</p>
<p>團體操表演中、澄衷中學的脫戰拳、與中國女體師的健身活動、一面造赤膊、一面是洗足、可謂無獨有偶、據說這兩項表演、是由王懷洪與杜宇飛新自奧林匹克大會中考察得來的、</p>
<p>昨日到會參觀者、不到萬人、除各校學生外、來賓到者極少、故看台四周、空隙甚多、與去年全國運動會時相較、冷熱截然不同、頗有滄桑之感、</p>
<p>各校女敎員之穿着豔裝者、昨在運動塲內外、竟發現多人、惟如驚鴻一瞥、稍縱卽逝、又女學校近來雖曾提倡禁止燙髮塗脂、但昨日女學生中仍有不少燙髮作飛機形者、</p>
<p>昨日國術塲中觀者甚少、大都未會注意、其實還是該塲最有噱頭、中華國術研究社摔角敎授率領全班人馬、表演器械、此公豪興不淺、精彩百出、</p>
<p>團體操中、民智中學之擬戰表演、大有意大利巴里拉之精神、在塲地上跌撲滾打、頗有生氣、中國今日靑年之訓練、當作如是操、不應再四他如跳舞式的美麗姿勢、學成公子哥兒樣、</p>
<p>兩江羅瑞蘭百公尺預賽、中途仆跌受傷、抬至救護室中闐無一人、司令台上大喊「有運動員受傷、救護先生快來」歷一刻鐘始見姗姗而來、曰此非急性病也、</p>
<p>此次參加體校組者、僅不見東南女體師一校、又南洋模範中　、向來頗注意運動、記得上屆小學聯運會該校不參加、本屆中學邋動會又不參加、</p>

<p>— 隅</p>
<p>當我看到魯迅先生被按置在他那永眠的棺內，我徘徊於他的靈寢的周圍，我覺得在他的棺上，我們應該放一把銳利的匕首。因爲魯迅先生不但是一個偉大的文學家，並且照我看來，他還是人類解放的戰士。德國十九世紀最偉大的詩人海里希·海湼（HeinrichHeine）曾有詩句，謂「放一把劍在我的棺上；因爲我是一個人類解放的勇敢戰士。」我對於魯迅先生，也有道樣的觀感。在他的棺上，我雖不像莎氏比亞中悲劇中那位主角「麥克俾士」那樣腦中幻想那兒有一把創存在，但我始終幻想那兒有一把鮮血淋漓的匕首存在。他的散文集，自「華蓋集」以至「僞自由書」「准風月談」以及「花邊文學」等，把社會的陰暗面，赤裸裸地呈現於我們的前面，妖，還他妖的原形；魔，還他魔的原形；鬼，還他鬼的原形；怪，還他怪的原形；正如高爾基的著作一樣，使沙皇側目，使地主貴族吃驚，而使小市民搖頭。換句話說，他的三十年的文學生活，是把那些紳士們外面用紅綠紙頭糊黏起米，包紮起來的血膿的潰創，毫不留情的用匕首一個個戳破，而在他的顯微鏡下，無法藏去了他們的肺癆，梅毒，痳瘋，臌脹。他的文學消極的作用是在消除那種陳死社會的烏烟瘴氣，而積極作用，是在敎導靑年的反抗精神。</p>
<p>我們過去有很深　傳統，我們最近有很深的外來壓迫。我們的曾祖一代是奴隸，對於宿命的哲學無條件的接受，我們的祖父一代是奴隸，對於宿命的哲學無條件的接受，我們的父親一代，還是奴隸，對於宿命的哲學，雖起了懷疑，並不毫無條件的接受，可也並不積極的反抗。我們父親一代，可以假定爲轉形期，（自然這轉形期一直到我們兒子這一代還沒有終止。）當轉形期的初期，我們的父親一代，雖曾參與那種變革，和親身看到那種變革，而社會的體系，也會從紅纓帽花翎，變爲峨冠禮服，可是那腦袋還是戴紅纓帽花翎的腦袋，而我們的文化依然是拖小辮子割「瞭子」的文化。這一時代，一直到五四運動後，纔有一新的變換，在這變換期後，魯迅先生及其他先驅者纔以新的姿態，反抗過去的傳說，而震驚中國文壇。然而五四運動的成就，只在文化思想方面，至於政治方面，並沒有隨着文化思想的突進而有所變動。可是跟着那種洶湧高潮的衝激，終於有十七年大時代的到來，然而這大時代也如法國戰後的　Grand　Siecle一樣，過去得太快。這幾年來，我們見到的是什麼，我們聽到的是什麼，我們身所遭受的是什麼，我們都能理會得。我們的行動的領域，我們思維的領域，正和我們疆土的領域一樣，日漸在狹隘起來。在這樣的狀况下，好多先驅者「功成身隱，」退出了反抗旗幟之外，而魯迅先生，却仍像因愛護人類而被鎖於高加索的巨人Prometheus一樣，依然毫不退却地在圍困中吶喊，到了死的前夕，猶在揮那鮮血淋漓的匕首。他的這樣的精神，眞使我們這樣患懶病的靑年慚愧。</p>
<p>魯迅先生是死了，然而他給靑年的影響將永存於我們中間。他雖屬於父親的一代，然而他的精神却是屬於我們這一代的。我們和他一樣不甘被打耳光，陪笑臉，也不甘拉夫不成而割去了耳朶，我們要繼續他的精神，揮他所遺留給我們那把鮮血淋漓的匕首，爲我們的祖國，爲人間的不平而奮鬥。</p>
<p>年靑一代的人們，我們不要忘記放在他的棺上的那一把鮮血淋漓的匕首。</p>
<h3 id="c162">一個够POG的男人 <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— 歐陽山</p>
<p>—哀念魯迅之一—</p>
<p>够POG——在廣東民衆底口頭上流行着這個字眼，是大膽，勇敢，毫無畏忌的意思。</p>
<p>魯迅先生死了。這猶如地球忽然停止了轉動，於是太陽變成躺在天空靜靜不動了我們再不能看見這麼巨大的一個男人工作和休息，憤怒和笑，斥駡敵人和安慰朋友，好像太陽每天一起一落，有陰有晴一樣。這不是痛哭可以盡量洩訴的事。然而我們可以看見臨頭一個屹然不動的太陽，雖然不動，但他底光明和熱力廣披着無邊的大地，速綿不絕的山嶽，無邊無涯的海洋，以至於萬萬年後。而且因爲他底撫育將使天地發出產生了牠底千千萬萬兒女以後的輝華的榮光。</p>
<p>上海紗廠的工人告訴我們，「魯迅還在」。他們是一點都不錯，而且說的時候一點也不躊躇的。魯迅當然還在。他底低沉的紹與的口音永遠不曾停止過，也將永遠不停止。</p>
<p>太陽還在。黑夜以及寄生於黑夜中的鬼魅敢出來嗎？我彷彿聽見全中國以及世界各部的民衆在大聲嚎哭，也彷彿聽見在什麼較陰暗的角落裏有竊竊私語甚至老鼠一般的笑聲。然而呌他們出來他們是死也不敢的。而卽令出來吧，也要扮成別付模樣，噢噢地哭着了。</p>
<p>太陽只有一個。在他底下一切都是渺小的。而他什麼地方都照亮，他底能力使最大的天文家底腦子窮於計算，他底莊嚴和偉大曾經使全世界最偉大的藝術家嘆服他們自己無法摹繪，他們只能多少將他一部分顯示出來呌大家用自己的想像去接近他底本相。尺寸斗斤兩當提到他的時候完全是可笑的東西，好像我們準備拿一個酒杯去計算海水。</p>
<p>把魯迅稱做巨星的人請把那樣的字眼改一改吧，因爲巨星並不曾用得愜當，人們將以爲他是黑夜裏映眼的星星之一，而不知他正是那顆最大的永遠睜開眼睛的恒星，把晝和夜給我們劃分出來的那顆恒星。</p>
<p>他底每一個字，每一句話，從他底淵博的學問，崇高的人格，堅强的戰鬥中結晶起來的，完完全全是我們自身，我們後代，以至世世代代的繼承者底毫無思疑的訓言。他到底敎懂了給予了我們多少東西，那是任何人都計算不出的。</p>
<p>我對於他的醫喩，頌讚，我自信那是做得很拙劣的。現在我底哀痛尤其使我無能爲力。我在半年之中經騐了高爾基和魯迅兩個人（速他們底病症和致死的原因都是那樣相類似的）底死亡給我的哀痛，使我這短短的生涯第一次瞭解到眞正的哀痛是什麼東西。</p>
<p>一個够POG的男人——不錯，我單用廣東民衆的語言講到他許多英雄性格中的一點吧，他眞眞正正是一個够POG的男人。</p>
<p>大的探險，飛行，小的個人决鬥，陣上對壘，都是一般人承認做男敢的行爲。我是那樣確信，假如他是一個飛行家，他能完全獨力完成環繞世界一週的不停留飛行。這如今還不曾有人做得到</p>
<p>他怎樣無情無畏地攻破了黑暗勢力底壁壘是大家都知道的事情，但他底够POG却還表現在卽令他底疾病不許他勞動的時候他還是無情無畏向黑暗的壁壘淮攻這一點上。在最近一次的病中，他還指導着中國底文學運動，而病一好起來（其實那裏是好起來呢？）他寫了許多雜文，動手翻譯死靈魂第二部</p>
<p>我們勸他休息，弄點娛樂的事情玩玩，尤其要完全停筆做長期間的療養，但對於他這些只是廢話。他對中國人民所負的如山的責任只有他自己知道得最淸楚！</p>
<p>對於敵人我們坦然以我們底偉人魯迅之死去換取必要必然的勝利！但我暗地裏想，卽令是朋友吧，但凡在病中催逼過他寫文章的都可惡！</p>

<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>十九日下午兩點鐘，我接到一個朋友的電話，問我魯迅先生逝世的情形，我當時愕然了一會，因爲那天爲了一點私事出去到一個地方，並未回家，也沒有碰到文壇上的朋友，實在毫無消息。據我所知，最近的魯迅先生是已經漸就康復了，雖然有時候還有一點熱度，他自己是並不當作一回事的，因此別人也就不當作一回事。對於這突如其來的死訊，我不相信。</p>
<p>而且我還疑心是某些人的搗鬼。是非之分，善惡之辨，那鴻溝，在魯迅先生的心中，的口裏，的筆底，是非常地淸楚的，所以他雖受愛戴，也常招咒駡，這咒駡不但沒有損及魯迅先生的偉大，而且反而使他的人格更其分明了。——一個專受愛戴，而不招咒駡的人，那才眞是一個怪人呢！</p>
<p>然而道「無損於他的偉大」，其在咒駡者，當然是不能滿意的。結果是造幾條離奇的謠言，發一些婆婆奶奶的心愿。</p>
<p>我常常想：魯迅先生是不會死的。</p>
<p>那一天直到我回到家裏，得到了另一個朋友的通知，我才知道魯迅先生眞的已經在早上五點廿五分，停止了他的最後的呼吸了。是的，他不過停止了他的呼吸。——我只能這麼說，因爲我仍舊相信：魯迅先生是不會死的！</p>
<p>我趕到萬國殯儀館，巳經過了下午六點鐘了。館前的電燈光放射出幽藍的綫條。跑上二樓，看見五六張哀蹙的面孔，在無言的沉寂裏，散怖着低低的嘆息，我們都知道這是一個缺憾，一個人類的正直者悄悄地離開道個世界了。胡風先生領我到隔壁一個房間裏，那裏躺着魯迅先生，瘦削的面孔，隆準的鼻子，濃濃的眉毛，鬍鬚，完全和活着一樣。我默默地站在他前面，我看見一幅圖畫，那上面賽着一個戰士在休息。那麼一幅莊嚴而又動人的圖畫呵！</p>
<p>是治喪委員會决定各界瞻仰遺容的第一天。</p>
<p>我一個人走在膠州路上，關念着這人類最大的損失。一個十四五歲的孩子從後面鑽上來，碰了一下我的袖角，問：</p>
<p>「請問，到萬國殯儀館向那面走？」</p>
<p>我懶於開口，只指了指前面，仍舊低着頭走自己的路，關念着這人類最大的損失。但因爲那孩子或前或後地和我並着肩，使我不得不注意起來。——那是一個臉孔黑胖，個子堅實的孩子，一頭烏髮，穿着藍布長衫，藍布鞋，兩只眼睛直楞楞地望着前面，爲着好奇，我問起他來了：</p>
<p>「上萬國殯儀　找誰去？」</p>
<p>「去看一個人。」</p>
<p>我不好意思再開口，仍舊默默地走着。將近殯儀館的時候，遠遠就望見館前聚着不少人，這孩子呌起來了：</p>
<p>「呔」那麼多的人，都是學生」</p>
<p>「你也是一個學生麼？」我冷冷地問。</p>
<p>「離開學校了，當着一個商店的學徒。」他看了我一眼，接着問：「你也到殯儀館去的麼？」</p>
<p>我點了點頭。</p>
<p>「是不是去瞻仰周先生的遺容？」</p>
<p>「是的。」我還是冷冷地，「你呢？」</p>
<p>「我也去的。」</p>
<p>一個奇怪的念頭忽然鑽進我腦裏，我站定了，向着那孩子說：</p>
<p>「你認識不認識周先生？」</p>
<p>「沒有碰過面。」</p>
<p>「那麼爲什麼要去看他呢？」</p>
<p>這孩子的眉毛竪起來了，圓圓的眼睛睜得很大很大，呌着道：「爲什麼，先生！這用得着問麼？周牛生給人類留下了很好的敎訓，爲着中國，爲着孩子，爲着正義和公道，他戰鬥了一生，現在，連最後的血肉也餵了我們了。活着的都該去瞻仰瞻仰他，這已經是最未的一次了呀！」</p>
<p>這像是一桶澆頭的冷水，然而我却覺察了這冷水裏的溫意。</p>
<p>之後，在靈前，除了中年的，老年的，異國的人們外，我看到更多的是那一批一批年青的學生，那一批一批工人子弟，那一批一批商店學徒，我的眼前突然光明起來了。我分明的感到：魯迅先生並沒有死，魯迅先生是不會死的！</p>

<p>— 草明</p>
<p>魯迅先生死了！這不幸的事情，將在民衆的腦筋裏刻下了一個永遠不能磨滅的殘酷的紀錄！</p>
<p>在看先生底每一篇文章，和他每次會面，聽他每句談話之後，都令我深深地感到了一種强靱的，粗壯的戰鬥力的鏗然的震盪。——無疑地，他一生的努力，是與黑暗勢力，和壓害壞了中國民族的一切腐敗的劣根性奮鬥，他給中國的廣大的民衆建立了不少功績，他沒有離開過民衆。這樣，魯迅先生，眞眞確確是民衆的了！</p>
<p>現在，魯迅先生死了，他給中國民衆的唯一遺產，就是「永不疲倦的奮鬥的精神。」</p>
<p>在他這一次害病的開頭，我曾經寫了一封問病的信這樣懇求他：</p>
<p>「……民衆是食婪的，他們要求你暫時休息，保養一個更健全的身體，爲的是需要你將來爲他們花更多的氣力……」</p>
<p>這時，使我發生了一點點抱怨似的情素，他是顯然忽略了我們年輕人那一類的請求的！——他完全忘記了自己了！他不讓自已休息一秒鐘——這次病情的轉劇，給我們證明了的。</p>
<p>他雖然給了我們許多精神上的食糧，但是，長遠地捺着乾癟的肚皮的饑餓的民衆，怎麼會饜足呢？</p>
<p>——我們底哀悼的程度，將爲這而加深了！</p>

<p>— 王任叔</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>二十日一早打開申報，就看到作家的廣告上，有魯迅先生最後遺著幾個字。我奇怪起來，總以著爲遺兩字是排錯的。趕快想打開本埠新聞來看，却在第一張轉角上又看到：「現代中國文壇重鎭魯迅先生逝世，請讀關於魯迅及其著作」的小廣告，這時我不敢再翻第四張，一下子呆了起來。</p>
<p>但接着，我起了一點小小的憤恨：利用別人的死，藉謀自己的利益，這相互掠奪的社會，我們還有允許它存在的理由嗎？</p>
<p>然而魯迅先生是早已懂得這一套了。兄弟那篇小說裏沛君的心理底描寫，就是很好的說明。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>雖然看到魯迅先生的次數可不少但總沒有請敎過。因爲我不敢。我是個缺點太多的人。一九二七年秋天，在上海流落。一聽到江灣立達學園要請魯迅先生演講的消息，我跟含戈趁着擠得死人的野鷄汽車到那邊去聽講。這是我第二次見到魯迅先生。（第一次在廣州中山大學演講的時候）。魯迅先生講的題目是「偉人的化石」。大意是說一個偉人在生前總多挫折，處處受人反對；但一到死後，就無不圓通廣大，受人歡迎。佛說一聲：「唵」，弟子皆有所悟，而所悟無不異。……想想道演講……魯迅先生的沉痛，是不難想像的。但我想，像魯迅先生那樣的堅貞的風度，卽使現在死了，也無法使他變成化石的。有人怪他晚年力量浪費，沒有用到中國文藝的建設上，那眞是井蛙語日，自顯其陋而已。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>左某一時期，那時指導者們，有所謂作品主義的非難。主要是對那時作品而發的。於是作家全都擱起筆來，跑到街頭去。一時，創作好像有中斷的形勢。我們作家固然不能忘却生活的實踐；但尤不能忽視作品的敎育的意義。以喊口號去驚動一二人的耳膜，何如以文字去敎育廣大的羣衆。魯迅先生是早看出這一點的。每次在大會上勸靑年勤於執筆，卽使沒有偉大的題材可寫，又何妨寫些日常平凡的東西。主要是在作者對事象的看法如何。魯迅先生今日對於有些批評家單純地强調國防文學的不滿，那是爲文藝，同時也是爲這垂死的民族而下針貶的。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>在做人上，我是個極無賴的失敗主義者。在我是痛恨自己的懦快，比痛恨別人的卑劣更甚。年來一讀魯迅先生的文章，益發看出了自己那種不可救藥的缺點。但因之，我得時時警惕：雖然是焦頭爛額，但總得撑起脊骨，不要在這光輝的明鏡下，「變形過來呵。然而，現在，魯迅先生終於死了。我失掉了可以照見自己形相的明鏡。我惶悚，我戰慄！我將無法在激湍的狂流中，撑住我自己了！……</p>
<p>承編者的好意，要我寫些紀念魯迅先生的文字。但是我哪裏配寫呢！一個失敗主義者，是沒有紀念老戰士的資格的。——我以爲。</p>
<h3 id="c169">我對魯迅先生的回憶和感想 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 白薇</p>
<p>在察冀的危急聲中，在北四川路×軍加崗的緊張局下，文壇巨星魯迅先生丟下了他戰士的使命，靜悄悄長眠了。人們再看不釗他內心飛濺的血化，作奮鬥向前的刺激，中國文壇損失了一位健將，這眞值得哀痛的。</p>
<p>昨晚報紙告訴我巨星殞落的消息，至今我悸慟的胸膛，總像儲積一囊流不出的熱淚，我不能像會寫文章的人們能寫出很好的哀悼，我只能寫點回憶，和感想。</p>
<p>當民國十五年，中國驀起革命的洪濤，我表弟從北京把吶喊寄到東京去，我讀了才驚知中國有一位文才魯迅，在我的幻想中，以爲他是矯健極俏皮的靑年。不久我回到廣州，郁達夫先生對我說：「魯迅是中國唯一的美少年。」</p>
<p>自寗漢合作，我帶着滿腔悲哀從武漢流到上海，寄食在創造社，我的情感完全是愛好創造社。那時起了語絲派和創造社的筆戰，我以偏愛創造社的精神，思想上曾站在和魯迅先生相對的營壘，我雖然並沒有若何表白。雖然北新老板和郁達夫先生，勸我把試作拿給了奔流，但我總嫌奔流灰色，我底精神還在創造社，正因爲精神和文章分擺在兩個不相容的陣容，我感到異常的痛苦，那痛苦，像一個有了愛人的女子，嫁給了一位不如意的丈夫，所以我對於奔流的編輯魯迅先生，明知他文才橫溢一世，却不想去瞻望尊容，這是我最初不去親近魯迅先生的原因。</p>
<p>一期一期的奔流送稿，我都是送到門口交給密司許，就風馳捷走了，經過半年，聽到魯迅先生對人說：「白薇怕我吃掉她。」</p>
<p>於是在初秋的熱夜，楊騷領我去見魯迅，我剛老到樓梯脚，躊躇又　跑了，不料魯迅先生溫和地在樓口上謦聲喊：「白薇請上來呀，上來！」我一溜走進他底書房，微低頭不敢正視。一把蒲扇對我的白衣　來，「熱吧？」他替我搧了兩下又去展開許多美術書畫給我看，並且和靄地給我說明那些圖畫的意思，我才看淸他是是我父輩的嚴肅可親的長者，一股敬愛的心，陡然湧上心頭</p>
<p>以後在奔流的酒席上，在集團中，在內山書店，碰見他很多，以公私事務，我上他家裏幾次，比較談得多，他總是以溫和誠懇的態度對我，說話總含着笑，有一次，他和地談得很多，且談到　愛兒海嬰的切一切，都酷肖他自己幼年時代，比方他幼時最愛萬花　的神秘美，海嬰也同樣愛玩這個，他要毀壞它來研究美的所在，海嬰也全一樣……</p>
<p>又有一次，我因醫生說：「非開刀便活不了多久，我急得去請敎學過醫的他該怎麼辦，他底回答是：——</p>
<p>「我想你還是開刀好，反正病到那樣，不開刀也是痛苦世終不會長命的，不如一刀兩斷割了它，要是你怕割了以後沒有悄感寫文章，那你就坐任紗廠去搖紗好了，今年搖紗，明年搖紗，輩子也搖紗，做個撤底的工人……」</p>
<p>只有最後一次，我去請他寫諷刺劇本，被他駡走了，從那經過一二八，種種原因不得再會談。但一變異常想念他，尤其在他害病時，再則時局緊張及論戰劇烈時，總想去聆聆高敎或勸說勸說他，這次統一戰綫開始，至論戰轟動中，我有三十次想去看他，總爲着我那怕見巨人的怪癖，阻止了多少應發的情感。所以聽到惡耗，我異常難過，特爲換了白衣，想跪哭他遺容前。可是嚴肅的靈堂人躋躋，我底淚流不出。</p>
<p>啊，收拾今天的熱淚，把這感情和靑年戰士們結成一倏鐵，繼承先生苦鬥的戰士精神，和敵人搏鬥在浩大的戰塲上去吧！</p>
<p>沒有鬥爭就不能生存，我不但愛魯迅先生的文學作品，更愛他那替文學革命的鬥爭精神，五四以來，他一面盡力做着淸道夫，掃除了文壇的訣魔魍魎，面挺消戰十的　容，不撓不屈地替文　革命史上建設了光榮的大路。尤以一九三〇年以來所表現的那種老戰士的精神，更爲一班靑年讀者　拜倒。</p>
<p>我們對於他的死固然十分悲哀，同時我們對於他的死應該當作一個深刻的刺激，把他戰士的精神放進我們更年輕氣壯的血裏，寬容大度的，親愛誠摯的，擁抱大衆的心靈在一起，向着敵人邁進，戰鬥到我們理想的世界出現就　。那末，魯迅先生就將和我們永遠生存。</p>

<p>— A．J.oMucha　M.D著　俄國勞働醫科大學畢業楊道南醫師譯</p>
<p>法蘭西妓館「洗淨所」的科學設備　巴黎美頂哥夫用人猿實驗發見奇跡</p>
<p>世界大戰的危機，已迫在眉睫，各國海陸空軍，都圍鎖在緊張的空氣中。為了要防止戰時軍士們精力的衰頹，於是在戰前國家特派檢查專任醫師，個別給軍士們施行嚴格的體格檢驗。經詳細檢查之下，發見了他們百分之九十皆有花柳病，而花柳病以淋病為獨多。對於這個普遍的病症，在治療一方面，確實感到異樣的困難。然而歐洲畢竟是科學發源之地，淋病的療法，早就超過水准線上。所以各國醫師，都規定軍士們採用最新的科學療法，那就是畢德博士所發明的蛋白體　色素合制劑「克淋儂」作為內服劑，經試用的結果，急性淋大都在四五瓶左右，完全治愈。慢性淋如攝獲腺炎，都能在短時期內，全部斷根，驗血證明痊愈。</p>
<p>據巴黎的大學教授美頂哥夫實驗，他曾用人猿施以淋病傳染，即見其兩　腫脹。以登陸種淋病藥飼之，病反增劇，惟以「克淋儂」拌合食物喂哺，通常僅四五星期即可痊治。因此法蘭西妓館都爭相採用此藥，以供給妓女及老狎客之用，大多收效至確，此外，妓館為防止淋病滋蔓，　　　　大量進服「克淋儂」。她們從前有政設府立的「洗淨所」，裏面的科學設備很多，就是在嫖客未行事前，雙方行使藥水洗滌，以免彼此傳染，但自「克淋儂」發明後，她們或他們，都在事前服「克淋儂」以振奮全身抗淋素，而防止淋病之侵襲，妓女並在陰道內納入「卡而雪地」以治淋病白帶。現在一般受丈夫淋毒傳染的婦女，白帶頻頻，她們都是同時用「克淋儂」內服和「卡而雪地」外用，其效力，真是出人意外。而兵士們也都把「克淋儂」當作唯一良侶了。</p>

<p>— 日本帝國大學醫科畢業陳敏伯醫師</p>
<p>由政府發給健康證明書；　否則卽擯拒於結婚圈外</p>
<p>德國在強國先強種之鐵的原則之下，對青年的結婚，須經政府派專門醫師作嚴格的檢查，凡是青年人在春機發動期時候，犯手淫而來的性神經衰弱，性器官矮小如兒童，卽停止發給結婚證。因此，德國的青年如犯有此咱惡癖的，無不暗暗四苦。但自梅倫氏發明了「補體康」一藥之後，這種青年已大多可獲結婚的權利了。因為「補體康」一藥，係採用雄壯的青春期的動物荷爾蒙所製成，對於色欲過度，尤其是青年手淫惡廦而來之性器官發育不全，遺精，滑精，見色遺精，及下部不能勃起，或勃起不能久持，與夫因此等性神經衰弱而起之頭痛腰酸，耳鳴眼花，記憶力，判斷力皆減弱，失眠心悸，均可服「補體康」而愈。因為「補體康」一藥，富有旺盛內分泌機能，強大生殖系的組織，把一切病態完全勝很徹底的除掉。所以性器官有正常的發展。同時又產生大量的精細胞，故一切性病都完全治愈。恢復他天賦的性的活潑機能。所以自然不會被擯於結婚圈子以外了。德國自有了「補體康」發明之後，結婚的人數，已增到三千五百六十余尤人的數目了。這偉大貢獻，完全是「補體康」的功勞呢！不過如兼有遺精患的人，可兼服「耐而斯遺精片」，以鎮攝精關，更能及早治癒。</p>

<p>— 前南洋醫科大學敎授滬南平民醫院長鄧源和醫師</p>
<p>丹麥居第一位荷蘭第二而以中國為最多　患肺病者必須顧到合於經濟條件之療法</p>
<p>（診所）寧波路四川路口　（診時）下午四時至六時</p>
<p>據肺病學家之統計，世界肺癆最少之國家，以丹麥為首，十萬人中僅有五一·五之死亡率。荷蘭則為五二·五，其他如英美德法，肺癆死亡北皆日見減少，此盡由各國公共衛生之進展；人民知識程度高，注重公德，而無隨地吐痰之惡習。故肺癆無法傳播。</p>
<p>此外由於科學之進步，一般療法，皆趨入正軌，如外科手術之施行，理學氣胸術，內科藥物收縮肺臓患部等，皆二十世紀科學異彩特放，各著名學者所認為最合理的療法是也。</p>
<p>然理學與外科手術的治療，必須有其適應症，不能行於一切患者。故此咱廣大之患者群，所仰賴於科學者，惟內科藥物療法之徒梅氏「補肺拿爾」內服，且此種製劑，乃最合於自宅療養病人之自療；更能切合一般之經濟條件。又以其效力之確實，而絕無副作用，與一般化學藥品之成分粗劣，刺激性強烈者迥異，因此「補肺拿爾」在歐西肺病學家眼中，幾視為治療上之南針。</p>
<p>患者於病勢進行時，服用「補肺拿爾」可使轉為停止性，吐血立見消失，食欲增進，咳融嗽寧息，咯痰減少，而抵抗力亦得增加，癆菌率被撲滅，此亦余得增加，癆菌率被撲滅，此亦余監床實驗所證明之事實。但對於體力過於衰者，如有遺精失眠等，可同時服以「補體康」以壯健神經，如斯則身體易臻壯健，可以迅速的接近治愈時期也。</p>
<h3 id="c190">女子氣量褊狹與月經病 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 南通醫科大學畢業武鐘麟醫師</p>
<p>許多人皆以為女子氣量褊狹，不容於人，因遭人嫉視；其實不知並非完全性理上如此，多由於病的變態而來。患者神經大多衰弱，偶逢小不如意之事，即易動怒，（俗稱肝火旺）頭暈頭痛頭重。心臓跳突不安，腰酸背痛，乳房不發育，臀部亦瘦削如男子。考其根本原因，不外卵巢機能失常，因卵巢支配人體之發育與健康者甚巨。故凡患上述種種症狀者，月經亦感困難。而受孕力亦非常薄弱，故多無子，他如早衰及白帶下，亦為此症常見之美症。</p>
<p>調整卵巢機能惟一之藥劑，厥惟「補女容」一藥。此劑為雌性活潑壯健之動物荷爾蒙所製成，能旺盛內分泌，能促進新陳代謝之機能增加卵泡之刺　素，並強壯腦神經及促生新血液。故凡患神經衰弱及月經困難，受孕力不足之女子，服「補女容」四五星期，即可導月經於調整，受姙力增強，性情溫柔嫻靜。並能使一切神經衰弱失眠症等治癒之。又因新陳代謝機能之亢進。故能充實肌肉，使皮膚細緻光滑，面色紅潤，妍態動人。故「補女容」一藥為婦女惟一之藥品，但如有白帶病者，可外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，以掃滌白帶。更為安全療法。此為余業在南通醫科大學畢業後，在多數病例中所得到之經驗也。</p>

<p>攝護腺炎之神經衰弱</p>
<p>在淋病中最易見之疾患，要以揶護腺炎一症為最。但攝護腺炎之症狀，亦極複雜。苟無學歷與經驗醫師，頗難鑑別。而攝護腺炎神經衰弱，尤感痛苦。因為此症不僅被淋毒所侵，且有遺精，早洩，或者陰莖不能勃起之苦。故其症狀之嚴重，又遠過任何淋毒性之合併症或續發症也。患者小便頻數，偶過勞動，則困難尤甚。會陰肛門有壓重之鈍痛。若行攝護腺檢查或按摩時，卽感到極大痛楚。其實，攝護腺並不十分腫大。此完全由於神經過敏故也。</p>
<p>此症因與性神經有密切關係，且攝護腺液如停止分泌，則對於生育上十九無望，據吾人平日之統計，患淋病而致失孕者，以攝腺神經性者占多數。故對於治療此病，須認定二個步驟，第一撲滅淋菌，第二恢復生殖力。始稱為徹底精到之療法。有住亞爾培路陸起美君。困淋病後失治，由慢性淋攝護腺炎，轉成神經衰弱，遺精，勃起力減弱，快感消失。余卽行電療與X線，更以「克淋儂」為內服藥。俾全體細胞發生抗淋素而包圍淋菌以喰殺之。經四星期之連續醫治，卽將淋菌肅清，厥症全愈。惟遺精等性神經衰弱，依然未除。卽更囑內服「補體康」以強壯性系組織，又兼用「耐而斯遺精片」以固精關。亦在三星期中治愈。靜養二月，卽與馮女士結婚，度其甜蜜而愉快性活，逾年而舉一子。足證已恢復生殖力。聞陸君之來余處冶療，係讀余之「性病全書」而來雲。（該書上海大東書局有售，每冊三角）。</p>

<p>— 陳少華醫師</p>
<p>婦女最常見最可厭者，厥為白帶病，此症因　道污液（即白帶）頻流，致由侵潤而糜爛，復因招惹細菌，往往見子宮出血，陰門炎，卵巢炎等而來月經不調，受姙力消失，同時健美亦大受影響。</p>
<p>「卡而雪地氏陰道片」，是婦女白帶病中之特效外用坐藥。以此片有殺菌，防腐，鎮痛，消炎，止泌之效。故白帶患者用之如湯沃雪，立見排除淨盡，乾潔異常，並其病灶，亦能平復如恒，惟因白帶而引起月經不調者，可服「補女容」，因淋病傳染者，可服「克淋儂」，以清除深部淋菌，尤為內外兼顧之治療。</p>

<p>— Kromayer　M.D.著　陸軍醫科大學畢業宋忠鈺醫師</p>
<p>精液為鼓舞肌肉與神經機能之源泉　新陳代謝亢進則全身健強精夜充足</p>
<p>卡本德博士說「在青年生活期間，延長抑制性欲的時期，便是延長身體發育的時期，如果青年而早有性的行為習慣，則身體和精神的發育，便要受阻」。原來在青年期的人，常會因性的不能抑制，而誤犯手淫，往往成為惡習，不斷的耗喪精液，因之發育受到阻礙，神經同時也就衰弱起來，而釀失眠腦弱等症。</p>
<p>據性病學家的分析，精液裏面含有一種增加全身新陳代謝的成分，呌做斯頒爾馬丁spermatin,這種成分為血液所吸收，身體上卽發生氣力的作用，以鼓舞肌肉與神經的機能。但是患　精的人，或因手淫惡癖的非法出精，血液內的斯頒爾馬丁自然減少，所以衰弱贏瘦，神經益形頹態，而有性的興奮等症，於是夜間桃色的艷夢繽紛，遺精遂不可避免。</p>
<p>為了從要根本上治療遺精，矯除手淫，耐而斯性神經學博士，於是發明特效遺精片，就是根據　攝輸精管，鎮靜性神經的原理，採取斯頒爾馬丁製為「耐而斯遣精片」，據博士和德國性病醫院醫師Demeter實驗，證明此藥治療遺精，有特殊功效。精漏，早洩，服之均奏美滿效果。且能補充體內斯頒爾馬丁，使神經機能亢進，這和其他專門固精的藥就有天壞之別了。不過因手淫後的過度衰頹，失眠健忘等，可同時服以「補體康」，則效驗更其神速，現在這療法已經普遍風行於各了。</p>

<p>— 楊道南醫師</p>
<p>胃痛乎　滿悶乎？</p>
<p>胃病為最易發生之疾患，蓋當飲食不慎，誤食腐敗，或咀嚼疏忽，皆易引發胃炎，當炎症發生之初，必有劇烈之嘔吐，若治療得當，卽可全愈。否則轉為慢性，而各種消化不良之症象，於焉發生矣。</p>
<p>但胃病之轉為慢性，多由服藥不對症所致，故在初起時如胃口不佳，卽宜服以強胃特效劑「強胃精」，以糾正胃粘膜之作用，庶保無虞。</p>
<p>查「強胃精」一藥，不特為急性胃病嘔吐食滯等之對症良藥。而慢性胃病之嘈雜口苦，見飯生厭，噯氣吞酸，或大便秘結，洩瀉，以及因腸中多瓦斯而放屁等，「強胃精」以其特殊偉異之功能，故最具卓驗，毫髮不爽。</p>
<p>且以此藥內含大量維他命甲乙丁，為治腳氣及病後體虛胃呆獨特上品，性尤王道。</p>

<h3 id="c196">草裙艷舞 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 無次</p>
<p>跳舞是時髦人的玩藝，當音樂奏起迷人的歌曲時，軟玉在抱，薌澤微聞，眞有點飄飄然的樣子。而且僕歐們又都是那麼卑謙，更顯出自己的高貴。不過高貴是要有代價的，正如享受也要代價一樣，於是當紳士們不能够維持這高貴時，舞池裏便淸淡了。</p>
<p>舞池裏淸淡，並不是因爲紳士們自己不需要刺激，而是刺激的程度的不够，好像一個有烟癮的人，日子一久，烟癮就越法加深，一兩口烟，像一點不覺得似的，於是唯一的辦法，就是增加刺激的力量。</p>
<p>草裙艷舞，就是這一種力量的表現，他的意義很顯明，紳士們除得肉體上需要享樂外，眼睛也得吃一點冰忌淋。當然，爲了口腹，是管不得有毒無毒，而且一個終日與毒爲伍的人，是不感覺到毒之可怕的。</p>
<p>這又呌做「如入鮑魚之肆。」</p>
<p>對於這一種盛會，自愧緣慳得根，不過是影片彷彿見過一二，而且讀讀報上的廣告，似乎也可以「窺見一斑」。這裏，只抄幾句在下面：「……由每一賽員分別表演，應有之「挺動，「抖動，」旋轉，「迎送」各種技巧，每一賽員身材不同，表演之姿態亦不同……各人暗地裏用勁，祇見肥臀如潮水般地起伏…」</p>
<p>這還不够消魂嗎？所以耳朶裏彷彿能够聽見風化先生在一旁哭泣。因爲風化先生的哭泣，又想起那些道貌岸然的人們，在前些時候，是曾經盡過一番維持之力的。維持的結果，是禁止草裙艷舞的再出現。</p>
<p>也許是時代不同了吧？或是維持的時日已經過期了吧？但最可靠的，大槪還是不要風化。－－風化本來就不能當飯吃的。不過說不要，其實又不盡然，中國是禮義之邦，幾曾見華夏之士會那樣的寡廉鮮恥。廉恥與風化，原是兩樣事，人們可以要廉恥，同時也可以要風化，辦法是這樣的：</p>
<p>當廉恥喪盡的時候，君子們一面縐着眉頭，用手掩着眼睛說「要不得，要不得！」但一面却又偷偸地張開眼皮，從指縫裏去看個痛快，這時候，「要不得」的聲浪還是繼續地延長下去，其實他本可以不必先喊，就「維持的，聰明一點的人，大槪可以知道他的所謂「要不得」就是一種烟幕彈，他必須要在烟慕彈的掩護下，才能够瞧個痛快。等到他停止了呼喊時，他自己早就看得厭倦了，而共他的人也就叨光賞受了一下。</p>
<p>以後大槪才是雷厲風行地「維持」的時候。</p>

<h3 id="c197">秋夜聽蟲記 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 廖楚啉</p>
<p>偶然在一張日本報紙上，看到一則勸入到一個什麼地方去「聽蟲聲」的廣告。深深地慨歎着日本人民的趣味之高。在中國，我們只有看到一些中秋之夜，一千人到什麼港賞月，結果，是坐在草地上，互相戲謔和唱唱流行的下級歌曲之類罷了。</p>
<p>賞月，而一定要中秋夜，一定要一千人，並且到了一個賞月勝地，却偏偏坐在草地上唱流行的低級歌曲，吃月餅，調笑，實在惡俗得可以了。</p>
<p>韓退之日：「以虫鳴秋」，秋眞是虫的世界，不論什麼地方，只要是秋夜，我們一定可以聽到虫聲的，卽使在上海說罷，有花園的人家，不必說，就是中下人家，只要有一方小小的天井，就可以聽到蟋蟀的哀吟了。</p>
<p>虫聲雖則隨在有，而要聽虫聲，却非選一個地方不可。下邊，是我個人的聽蟲經騐。</p>
<p>看月雖則一般人都注意八月，其實九月的月色更淸，還是三四年前的一個深秋，我因爲病，住在一個邨落裏，有一天晚上，不知爲什麼，轉側不能入夢，翻騰倦了，就支起身體，倚枕閒想。這時，已經夜半，月色照在紙窓上，牀前映着無數的小方塊。風動着一株細竹，搖曳着映在窓上，像一幅文與可的墨竹，牀下有三四匹蟋蟀，一遞一聲的呌着。</p>
<p>我靜靜地聽着，半小時，忽然覺得厭煩了起來。正思入睡，忽在一格壞了的紙窓中，飛進一匹秋蟲，月明中，看不淸是什麼，這匹蟲，飛了進來，還沒有站定，就「吱……啊……吱……啊」的呌了起來·我於是知道飛進來的，原來是一匹「紡織娘！」</p>
<p>紡織娘一呌，屋內的聲音就立刻不同了　四匹哀怨的蟋蟀聲，給紡繼娘尖銳的聲音一節奏，也錯綜了起來。我</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>閉着眼睛聽去，十分高興。但是人類是不容易滿足的，我忽然想到這時候原野裏的虫聲，是何等複雜和偉大，於是我披着業下妝來，扒開門闖入的，就是一片水也似的月光。接着一陣虫聲－像暴雨一樣的落在你身邊；嘈嘈切切，萬樂俱作，聽去，只是混然一片分不淸其中到底有幾種不祠的聲音。</p>
<p>一輸月，掛在中天，廣大的原野，浸在銀灰色的月中，露下了，草木着了露珠，格外晶瑩和鮮暢。於是我漫漫地向前，我要到附近一個凉亭中小坐。這凉亭，是在不遠的溪邊，亭外有三四株老樹，蔓着的野藤，從樹幹直爬到亭上。</p>
<p>走到亭上，首先入耳的，到不是虫聲，而是浮浮的水聲，這不是說虫聲突然停止了，也不是凉亭旁邊沒有虫聲，實在因爲虫聲早已滿耳，所以，反似不聞；而淙淙的水聲，却有一初見眼明」之槪。</p>
<p>在凉亭坐下，我就仔細的聽起虫聲來，原來這班自然之樂隊，是以大聲的絡緯娘爲主唱，而以高嗓子的紡織娘爲和，以響亮而鏗鏘的金鈴子爲鈸，而以寂寞的寒蛙爲結。這一部樂隊，似乎有一個非凡的指揮者，在指揮着。所以，有時粗嗓子的絡絲娘一齊停止，而只讓金鈴子細緻的運腔；有時候紡織高抗的獨奏，而結以萬聲俱作的交響。這時候，我已經不能讚嘆，只是不絕的點頭。</p>
<p>虫的樂隊，一曲一曲的奏着，時間漫漫地過去，直到東方微白，這樂隊漫漫的息下來，最先是金鈴子停止，後來是寒蛙，更後是紡織娘，只有絡緯娘，到紅日東昇，還不時有一二短呌。</p>
<p>自從那一次到現在，已經整整三年沒有聽到那偉大的秋蟲的合奏了。但是，這秋之音樂，我始終沒有忘掉。今天看到日本報紙的廣告，又苦苦的回憶起來了。</p>
<p>住在都市中的友人，我希望你們有機會，去聽聽虫聲。</p>

<p>— 沈家千</p>
<p>那小姑娘還生得漂亮。眞人不說假話，我們三個人都不是做不來壞事的，但是所聽到的，看到的情形，不是要排遣二個鐘頭，我們也早已跟着何二走了。「遂令天下父母心，不重生男重生女」，想來彷彿是欺人之談。</p>
<p>幾分鐘過去了，我們都沒有開口，在這種地方，本來是可以隨意說話的。而且說得浮滑一點也顯得你是「老手」，但是有一種力睹着我們的喉管，卽是最規矩的話，也想不起來。</p>
<p>那個老婆子或許在門外竊聽，她所希望的見沒有希望到，就進來裝神弄鬼了，姑娘年紀輕啦，先生們不中意啦，自己問了又自己回答，一步進一步地逼得我們非開口不可了。</p>
<p>我們就乾脆地告訴她天一亮就要動身，有吃的束西燒點出來，要許多錢隨你開價。於是老婆子又高興地穿出竄進了，湊了四碟菜，燒一鍋子粥，我們邀了那小姑娘一同吃粥。</p>
<p>沒有多少時候天亮了，我們給了小姑娘五塊錢，母女倆個謝着送到門口，有一個警察在那裏踱來踱去，對我們瞥了一眼，和那老婆子說話了，也是用一切口」的，或許又是拆一點分頭吧？（旅途雜誌之一）</p>
<h3 id="c199">漁汛 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 允海</p>
<p>是漁汛的時候了。村里還冷落得很，碼頭上還疏疏落落地撑起了三幾支長桅，比之從前，這一年的漁汛是太寂寞了。</p>
<p>老三，這垂頭喪氣的老傢伙，這天穿了件從省城四牌樓買回來的舊大衣，一步一傾斜地來到了碼頭，眼看着幾個從前，－不要說遠了，便是上水船也還是親兄弟的朋友，在那里預備又去趕這一秋汛，他心里不由得便發了一陣子悶</p>
<p>「我老三難道趕不上人家」！</p>
<p>他很憤恨地一手抱拳，很用力地槌在另一只芭蕉般的手掌中，口里呢呢喃喃地怨懟。憑經騐，他老三是一個數一數二的人物的，在水上跑了便足二十個年頭，孩子時候便在波浪里翻滾着了，什麼大風浪不經過，現在不過上了點年紀，手臂壞了一次，便給人家期屁股踢了出來，－那不是欺負人家嗎？</p>
<p>「丟乃扔」，他瞪大了那一雙紅眼睛，很忿忿然地在駡：有錢人家是烏龜，三代都是扒灰佬－我老三有點什末對不起，要時便呌着來，用舊了用殘了便要滾蛋！你那奶奶個爛臭×！」</p>
<p>他給海風括得有點眼紅了。</p>
<p>海那邊，很平靜，沒風，興不起大浪。三幾隻沙鷗在那兒哇啦哇啦地呌着，飛的姿勢很活潑，也很自由快樂。對過，山象牙齒那末地豎得整整齊齊，半山腰浮上一層輕雲，很好看。在這末的一個情景，他老三便是不很慣熟的客人。有時，他，躁暴慣了的傢伙，是很不客氣地埋怨和詛咒這要人命的謎一般的海洋，他恨他不時興風作浪。但是，現在什麼仇恨也瓦解了，卽使是出生入死的生活，也沒了他老三的份兒。</p>
<p>於是，他想該到東家那邊走一趟了。也許，在這秋汛，他老三還可以勉强掙一水－</p>
<p>「對啦，走一水得一水，空下來在家吃黃湯嗎？」</p>
<p>碰了一個船上的朋友了，那兩個孩子的父親，三十歲年紀的阿財哥，從市那邊吃得半醉地趕回來，準備碰這一水船，用命換來的一家四口的兩頓稀飯。他們倆碰頭了，在楞着眼睛呆瞧着。好一會兒，才算給一聲嘆氣帶開了頭，講下去了－</p>
<p>「阿財哥，你的運氣好！」</p>
<p>「三叔，別說了！」這個帶點惝恍地回答着。「還不是一樣！我和你不過差一根香脚錢吧，誰又可以吃喝個飽，不是有」水挨一水嗎？」頓了一頓，吐了一大口黃水，才斷斷續續地接着說：「</p>

<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>我們的命又不是放在他們手上。沒下船的，算是餓着活。放一水船，不又是靠海龍王的施恩，帶命回來吃十天八天；崛尾龍命裏注定的，那便落下水里沒了命，又誰個菩薩敢担保嘞！總之——呃</p>
<p>嚕哩嚕囌的長命說話沒說得盡，便是一個酒呃，喉里一酸，滿口黃水從嘴里便直往四下里射了。跟着，說話越顯得沒决序了，反連累得老三扶了他（未完）</p>

<p>藝華公司新出偉大笑劇「喜臨門」。决定廿四日起在新光大戲院公映，看過試片的人說：「喜臨門」笑料豐富，可以媲美卓別林的「摩登時代」，它在國產滑稽影片中，確是空前的傑構。</p>
<p>喜臨門」攝取的外景，完全是鄕村的美景，裏面還有不少大衆化的民間戲劇，使你看了感覺鄕村生活的恬靜優美，决不是都市中人所能想像得到的。</p>
<p>周璇在劇中飾一個村中美女，東來求婚，西來求婚，她父親以爲奇貨可居，實行買賣婚姻，結果嫁給表兄馬陋芬，關宏達大吃其醋，組織哭喪團，結婚那天，狹路相逢大鬧笑話，周璇從花轎中奔逃，鄕人當她是「木乃伊」出現，這一下害得她上天無路，入地無！</p>
<p>關宏達愛上周璇，不會寫情書，害了相思病，抱着父親喚「妹妹我愛你」，頗爲噱頭。他父親是體面紳士，滿口仁義道德，而暗中偷偷摸摸「眞是風流老少」，他寗可見了老婆罰跪地板，玩女人依然我行我素。</p>
<p>節孝坊畔的寡婦，春情滿懷，紅杏出牆。和假道學你來我往，醜發四揚，爲了搶親而子捉父姦，眞是荒天下之大唐！莫怪老人家說天道反了！「喜臨門」笑料眞多，馮觀衆自己去欣賞了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Arida Visits Prime Minister Hirota to Discuss New Policies Towards China; Three Ministers to Exchange Opinions Today; Final Important Decisions to Be Made After Listening to Suma's Report; Next Meeting Date Between Zhang Qun and Kawagoe Yet to Be Scheduled; Japanese Ambassador Consults with Sato and Kita Yesterday <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Foreign Minister Arida paid a morning visit to Prime Minister Hirota on the 22nd, discussing various plans regarding the new policies Japan will adopt towards China in the future for over an hour. It is reported that Foreign Minister Arida, Army Minister Terauchi, and Navy Minister Nagano will exchange extremely important opinions on the morning of the 23rd. However, the final decision will only be made after waiting for Consul General Suma to arrive in Tokyo on the 23rd and listening to his report. There are currently two opposing opinions here, causing quite a stir. One faction predicts that Foreign Minister Arida intends to fundamentally change Japan's plans so that China can accept them, in order to promote a friendly resolution. The other faction believes that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' attitude towards China is incompatible, and Japan has a tendency to become tougher. However, the former opinion seems closer to the truth than the latter. According to a Nanjing dispatch from local newspapers, the Japanese Embassy in China decided last night to request formal instructions from Tokyo to set a deadline for China to accept Japan's rejected demands. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news received here, it is sufficient to indicate that although Foreign Minister Zhang and Ambassador Kawagoe's fifth meeting involved two and a half hours of debate, they still did not find common ground on the two major issues of "specialization of North China" and "joint anti-communism." The negotiations seem to have reached a point where there is no room for further exchange of opinions between the two sides. After meeting with Foreign Minister Zhang, Ambassador Kawagoe immediately convened a meeting of key embassy staff and decided to send Consul General Suma to Tokyo to report. Tokyo's attitude towards the latest developments will apparently be decided after Consul General Suma arrives in Tokyo. It is said that Ambassador Kawagoe intends to request another meeting with President Chiang at the end of October or the beginning of November. The opinions of Tokyo newspapers this morning seem moderate, but they unanimously express deep concern about the significant difficulties in the future of the negotiations. According to general observations here, negotiations may continue in the next few days, but it may be necessary to make considerable changes to diplomatic techniques. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Following five meetings between Kawagoe and Foreign Minister Zhang to exchange opinions on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, Suma, a secretary at the embassy, ​​left for Japan on the Nagasaki Maru on the 21st.

<p>(Nanjing) Recently, the prices of yarn, cotton, flour, rice, and wheat have all been rising. The reporter made a special visit to Ma Yinchu, Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan, to inquire about the reasons. According to him, there are many reasons for the rising price of yarn and cotton, but the rampant speculation by speculators is the main reason. The rising prices of flour, rice, and wheat are mostly due to purchases by a certain party and private hoarding, and speculation is secondary. It is said that Ma was originally scheduled to go to Guangdong on the 22nd to participate in the national funeral of the late Chairman Hu, and his luggage had been prepared, but he unfortunately relapsed with the disease and was unable to go. It is also reported that the Ministries of Finance and Industry believe that rising prices are a good phenomenon for the economic recovery of our country, as farmers are celebrating and industry and commerce are benefiting. However, such price increases must be reasonable changes. If they rise and fall suddenly, it is obvious that speculators are flipping them for profit. They are currently watching market trends to decide on effective countermeasures. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)</p>

All Belgian engineers and technical experts in the Qinhuangdao Yaohua Company manufacturing plant will be replaced by four Japanese, but there will be no changes to the Chinese staff. The directors elected after the purchase of Belgian shares include Nansen, the British general manager of the Kailuan Mining Bureau, another important British employee of the bureau, and five Japanese.

Furthermore, according to Sang Jingchuan, Deputy Director of the Income Tax Office, although the income tax collected this month includes both income from government bond interest and income from salaries and remuneration of civil servants, only the Haihe government bond is included among the government bonds, because it is being redeemed and interest paid this month. The paying agent has been notified to withhold the tax on its behalf. This interest is paid semi-annually, representing six months of interest. According to the law, it is not retroactive and only one month of interest income will be taxed this month, that is, one-sixth of the total interest income. Other government bonds will not be subject to income tax because the interest payment period has not yet arrived this month. As for foreign employees working in various government agencies in our country, they are also subject to income tax on their salaries and remuneration as civil servants. Foreign employees of the Salt Revenue Audit General Office have already had their taxes withheld in accordance with the law when their salaries for this month were paid.

<h3 id="e50">SUIYUAN HORSE PRODUCTION COMPETITION SKETCH (PART 1) <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Zong Liangdong</p>
<p>Suiyuan is the best horse-producing area in northwest China. In recent years, the authorities have devoted great attention to horse administration, resulting in rapid progress in both breed and quantity. However, the driving force behind this achievement must be attributed to the grand "Horse Production Competition Meeting" held annually. This meeting was founded in the autumn of 1932 and this year marks the fifth session. The results of each session show a trend of annual progress. According to a survey by the Ministry of the Army in 1919, the national horse production was only 5 million, and it subsequently declined year by year, reaching only 1 million in 1924. This shows that previously, insufficient attention was paid to the horse production industry. However, since Suiyuan Province started the horse production competition in 1932, there has been a trend of annual increase. Before the horse production competition was held, the number of horses imported by Suiyuan Province was only 7,701. Although the number increased year by year in 1932, 1933, and 1934, the highest number was only 14,046. However, by 1935, it reached 17,157. From this quantity, we can see the prosperity of the colonial industry in recent years, and this horse production competition meeting has to be given attention and strongly promoted.</p>
<p>The Suiyuan horse production competition meeting is different from the ordinary horse racing in big cities. General horse racing has some gambling nature, while the Suiyuan horse production competition is completely designed to promote scientific breeding methods in a semi-entertaining way. There are two ways to compete in the meeting: one is "horse racing" and "trotting" competitions; the other is the exhibition of "young horses" (stallions) and "broodmares" (mares). On the one hand, the competition tests the physique from an ability perspective, and on the other hand, the exhibition is designed to improve the breed. Moreover, the competition is conducted simply and practically, and the preparations are presided over by the government authorities, and everything is very thorough and fair. Therefore, every session of the meeting attracts crowds of people to visit, and some even come from the Mongolian grasslands far away to see it.</p>
<p>This year's session opened on the auspicious Double Tenth Festival in the refreshing autumn breeze. Although the situation in the frontier is tense, it is truly rare to be able to hold such a grand meeting in a dangerous environment. Especially for me, who came to the Northwest for the first time, I feel even more excited and curiously feasted my eyes.</p>
<p>The venue is located on the south side of the main road between the new and old cities of Suiyuan. It is a vast grassland with over a dozen hectares of land. The racetrack is more than three Chinese miles in circumference. The main entrance faces north and is a modern reinforced concrete archway with the words "Suiyuan Racecourse" on it. A road leads from there to the racetrack, with newly planted poplars and locust trees on both sides, creating a very spectacular scene. On the opening day, the weather was rare and sunny, and tens of thousands of spectators gathered from the main roads of the new and old cities, men and women, old and young, each excitedly squeezing in. Some "women" arrived in a long line of cars, while those from nearby were carrying benches and lunch boxes, planning to watch there all day. There were also princes and ladies from the Mongolian grasslands, tall and dressed in peculiar costumes, sitting high in the stands. Therefore, the usually deserted square was now packed with people. The authorities had made very thorough preparations in advance. There were parking areas for cars, rickshaws, and sedans, all well organized. The vendors selling tea and snacks, shouting and clamoring, also temporarily set up tents, making cash transactions, and their business was booming, which was a good source of income for them.</p>
<p>In the northeast of the venue, there are two large grandstands, with a speaker's platform in the middle. During the opening ceremony, the platform was full of military and political figures from the frontier. Flags, silver shields, saddles, and various other prizes were truly dazzling to the eyes of every spectator. The horses participating in the competition were led by jockeys in front of the stage for inspection. The jockeys wore white-lettered, blue-bottomed racing silks and caps of various colors depending on the nature of the race. The horses wore red, green, and other colorful silks around their necks or tied to their tails. Every jockey was filled with the desire for a trophy, and the spirited, outstanding, and shiny horses also seemed to know that the competition to chase the wind and electricity was their supreme glory.</p>
<p>On the first day of the competition, because it was the Double Tenth Festival, although the national crisis was serious, everyone seemed to want to find some joy in suffering, and a new atmosphere was evident on the faces of every spectator. The male and female guests from various countries also added to the attention of the audience. Chairman Fu Zuoyi sat for several hours from the opening ceremony to the competition, despite his busy military and political affairs.</p>

<h3 id="e51">The Proposed Far Eastern Three-Power Pact <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>－Secret Documents Published by the US State Department－</p>
<p>At this time of extreme tension in the Far East situation, the US State Department seems intentionally revealing some of the inside story of past Anglo-Japanese diplomatic relations by picking out and publishing some secret records from its archived diplomatic files, which is worthy of our attention. The secret records concerning the disposition of German colonies at the Paris Peace Conference published this month by the US National News Agency have been transmitted by telegram and published in this newspaper a few days ago. From the newly received US newspapers, we have also seen another secret record published by the US State Department last month, which describes the situation in 1921 when Britain contacted the United States to conclude a secret military pact between Britain, the United States, and Japan. This is also a very valuable historical diplomatic material. The main contents are as follows:</p>
<p>In 1921, just as US President Harding and Secretary of State Hughes had issued invitations to convene a disarmament conference in Washington, Britain contacted the United States to hold a three-power meeting between Britain, the United States, and Japan before the conference. The British government intended to send a British warship carrying British Prime Minister Lloyd George, British Foreign Secretary Curzon, and the prime ministers of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand across the Atlantic Ocean to Bart Harbor to attend the three-power meeting. At that time, British politicians, because of the controversy over the Anglo-Japanese alliance at home, obviously hoped that the major three powers in the Pacific would discuss and agree on a military pact as a preparation for the disarmament conference. According to the British proposal, the purpose of convening the three-power meeting was to agree on military terms and, "if possible, to establish a common understanding on broader principles for the future Pacific policy of the two powers." On July 27, 1921, British Ambassador to the United States Geddes delivered a British Foreign Office letter stating the above plan to US Secretary of State Hughes. The British ambassador also said, following the instructions of his government: "The Imperial Government not only pays close attention to this preparatory meeting between the United States, Britain, and Japan, but also considers it very important. Although Congress has not yet closed, they are preparing to send government officials across the Atlantic to attend the meeting in the United States in order to discuss these issues."</p>
<p>On July 27, US Ambassador to London George Harvey sent a cable to Washington, supplementing the contents of the British Foreign Office letter. He said that the British delegation would travel to the US on a "high-speed warship," and was scheduled to stay for a week, arriving on August 18 and returning on August 25. He also said: "The accommodations or hotels for the British delegation must have facilities to accommodate 20 to 24 people, including representatives and secretaries, and 15 private servants." According to Curzon's calculations, the Japanese delegation would need residences that could accommodate 10 to 20 people.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Hughes directly rejected this proposal. He said that the United States had already invited countries to meet to discuss common issues related to armaments and the Far East. Britain and other countries have accepted the invitation on this basis. Japan did not seem very enthusiastic about the three-power preparatory meeting, and other countries would inevitably feel unhappy about it. Hughes' attitude in opposing the British proposal was clearly very firm, and he said the following in a long reply cable to Ambassador Harvey on July 28:</p>
<p>"If terms are agreed upon or any actions are taken to manipulate the conference at such a preparatory meeting, everyone will feel that the outcome of the conference is in fact predictable. If the three countries cannot reach a compromise due to differences of opinion, the conference will be unlikely to succeed."</p>
<p>Hughes' instructions added that it would be "difficult, if not impossible" to arrange comfortable accommodations in Bart Harbor.</p>
<p>On July 8 of that year, Hughes had telegraphed Ambassador Harvey, ordering him to explore the British views on the proposed three-power meeting. On that day, Ambassador Harvey reported his conversation with Curzon from London. According to Harvey, "The feeling here against the continuation of the Anglo-Japanese alliance is getting stronger every day. Curzon said without hesitation that any such special arrangement would inevitably be eliminated by a kind of understanding that we are considering..."</p>
<p>Part of Harvey's telegram released by the State Department has been deleted. The deleted portion was apparently related to the Anglo-Japanese alliance.</p>
<p>The State Department also released a telegram from British Chargé d'Affaires in China Rodoque on July 18 of that year, in which he mentioned the views of Chinese Foreign Minister Yan Huiqing on the British proposal. "He (Yan) believes that Britain's initiation of the Pacific Conference is to seek a possible way out for the Anglo-Japanese alliance. In order to prevent this and ensure the success of the conference, Yan would rather Britain be constrained by the alliance before the conference."</p>
<p>The preparatory meeting did not take place. The Washington Conference produced the Nine-Power Treaty and the Four-Power Treaty. The Far Eastern question and disarmament were thus temporarily resolved.</p>
<p>At that time, the US government received a strong protest from the Soviet Union, which stated that the Soviet Union had read about the conference in the newspaper; "it is also an independent country in the Pacific" and had to request to join. The Russian document was delivered to the US Chargé d'Affaires in Sweden on July 21 and was never answered by the United States, because at that time the US government did not want to join hands with the Soviet Union.</p>

Large numbers of various aircraft flew over the lines, hindering the government troops' movements. The general offensive was concentrated on Navalcarnero. The defending troops resisted fiercely but were unable to hold and surrendered. The rebel army also fiercely attacked several villages about six miles west of Escorial, the last fortress of Madrid's outer defense line. Based on current observations, Madrid's fall is imminent. After the capital falls, the war will shift to Catalonia. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Navalcarnero—The military and civilians of this city retreated today, but fierce battles are still ongoing nearby. This place is only twenty-one miles from the capital and is of great strategic importance. With the loss of this city, Madrid's defenses are increasingly in jeopardy. (National Telegraph, 21st)</p>
<p>Madrid—Our correspondent reports that the troops of Nationalist generals Asensio and Delgado entered Navalcarnero yesterday after ten hours of fierce fighting with government troops south of the capital. The city is thirty-two kilometers from Madrid and is a key southwestern gateway to the capital. The terrain is strategically important. The defensive works established by the government troops in the area were extremely solid, with a total of six defense lines, formidable weaponry, and perfect organization, but they were ultimately broken through one by one by the Nationalist army. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Valmahato—Our correspondent reports that General Varela's Nationalist troops attacked Navalcarnero this morning, but after advancing four kilometers, they encountered fierce resistance from government troops. The government artillery launched a barrage of fire and used machine gun teams for crossfire to stop the Nationalist army's advance. The two sides then engaged in artillery warfare for an hour. The Nationalist army then dispatched ten aircraft to the government troops' positions, bombing them from a height of several hundred meters above the ground, and eventually destroying the government artillery. By 10:00 AM, the Nationalist army resumed its advance and is now no more than two kilometers from Navalcarnero. (Havas, 21st)</p>

<p>Madrid—Navalcarnero, the main western barrier of the capital, fell completely into the hands of the rebel army last night. Therefore, the besieging army, from Illescas to Cigüeñuela, has been able to connect from end to end, with only a gap in Escorial. Yesterday at dawn, the colonial troops under Colonel Varela continued to advance along the Taravilla River, with Valmojado as their base and Navalcarnero as their target. Government troops and militiamen fiercely defended from trenches on the mountainside, using machine guns to stop the rebel army's advance. Navalcarnero was surrounded by six lines of trenches, the second and third of which offered particularly fierce resistance. Foreign legionnaires and Moors engaged in close combat with elite government troops. The government artillery also heavily bombarded the rebel army's rear, without interruption. Then, a squadron of ten rebel army tri-motor aircraft strafed the government troops' strongholds and artillery with bombs until they were silent, and shot down four government aircraft that resisted. Thereupon the rebel army was able to advance and occupy Navalcarnero. The militiamen are now retreating towards Madrid and have lost their will to fight. In this battle, the rebel army was victorious after ten hours of fierce fighting, mostly relying on the strength of the air force. Now that the obstacle has been removed, they can launch a final fierce attack on the capital. A major offensive will be launched from the southwest, with Illescas as the base. General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the rebel army, expects that after Madrid falls, the government troops will retreat to Catalonia, with Barcelona as the capital, to make a final struggle in the newly declared independent republic. After the fall of Navalcarnero, morale in the capital is exceptionally high. According to a radio broadcast today, Madrid's attack was expected. Now, the roaring artillery is gradually approaching. Thousands of women are marching in the city in groups, carrying red flags with slogans such as "They shall not pass," and shouting "Men and women, all go to the front lines." These people crowded into the office of Caballero, the Commander-in-Chief and Prime Minister of the government troops, demanding the mobilization of all residents to defend the capital. Young women are now flocking to the southern and western suburbs to help the militiamen defend the trenches. There are thousands of militiamen there, determined to die in battle, waiting for the attack. Responsible officials say that the government troops are currently launching a successful counterattack in the Illescas area, which has greatly boosted the morale of the militiamen. Today, all the enemies captured by the government troops in Cartagena were shot, because the rebel aircraft had attacked the town for an hour, causing heavy damage and many casualties among the residents.

<p>Barcelona—Our correspondent at the Aragon front reports that government troops launched a large-scale attack on the city of Huesca this morning, with extremely fierce artillery fire that continued until noon. Several shells landed in the city's bullring (recently converted into rebel barracks) and the gunpowder depot. The rebel army suffered considerable losses. The government troops have now advanced. As of 5:00 PM, the battle is still ongoing. (Havas, 21st)</p>

<p>(London) Madrid has taken precautions to protect the more than two hundred British nationals residing in the city during air raids. The roofs of the British Embassy and nearby buildings have been painted with the British flag. According to news received from London, there are currently nearly ten thousand prisoners and hostages in Madrid, including more than one thousand five hundred women. The situation of most of the women is extremely miserable. Their children are crying for food, and they themselves can hardly get enough to eat. With the assistance of the British Chargé d'Affaires, the Red Cross is doing its best to rescue the helpless women. Dr. Junod of the International Red Cross has also discussed with the authorities of the newly established Basque government in Bilbao and Burgos the method of exchanging women and children as hostages. Detailed information has been received here. On October 11, one hundred and fourteen women as hostages were transported by the British warships "Exmouth" and "Echo" from Bilbao to Saint-Jean-de-Luz. It is reported that British Consul Stevenson, British Vice-Consul Hughes, and Captain Borough assisted Dr. Junod's work. All the women who took refuge expressed their deep gratitude to the British Navy for their righteous act, and shouted "Long live Edward VIII." On October 17, the British warship "Echo" transported forty-one children and five nurses from San Sebastian. Before boarding the ship, they were given souvenirs by the mayor of the city at the Red Cross office. When they arrived in Bilbao, a large crowd of welcomers was waiting at the port, and the mayor and the consular corps held a meeting to welcome them. Dr. Junod, together with more than one hundred refugees, departed from Bilbao on the British warship "Escort" last Saturday for Saint-Jean-de-Luz. The local Red Cross authorities have telegraphed their gratitude for the assistance of the British warships. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>

The Acting Foreign Minister of Argentina, Castillo, has recently sent a note to the Spanish Foreign Minister, Thalvaio, urging him to pay attention to this. (Havas, 21st)</p>

<p>(London) The National Labor Association, representing the Executive Committee of the Trades Union Congress and the Executive Committee of the Labor Party, held a meeting today to discuss the general situation in Spain and the implementation of the non-intervention agreement in the Spanish Civil War. It lasted a long time. They unanimously expressed concern about the one-sided observance of the non-intervention agreement and the serious harm that the violation of the agreement has caused to the Spanish government. They then decided to apply to the International Federation of Trade Unions and the Labor and Socialist International to hold a special joint meeting in Paris as soon as possible to reconsider the facts of the violation of the agreement. This resolution indicates that although the British labor and trade union movement has not yet definitively decided to change its non-intervention policy, it may decide to change it after consulting with labor and trade union comrades abroad. It is reported that the International Labor Conference has responded to the request of the National Labor Association and is scheduled to meet in Paris at the end of this week. The British representatives plan to report the results of the meeting to the National Labor Association on October 28. Attlee, the leader of the opposition party, will express the Labor Party's views when the House of Commons meets the next day to discuss the general situation in Spain. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) The Secretary-General of the International Federation of Trade Unions, Sir Walter Citrine, also the Chairman of the British Trades Union Congress, has recently traveled to Paris to prepare for the opening of the joint meeting. (Havas, 22nd) (London) The National Executive Committee of the Labor Party has held lengthy discussions on the situation in Spain and the implementation of the non-intervention agreement. Today, Major Attlee, Chairman of the Labor Party in the House of Commons, reported to the Executive Committee on the results of his talks with Foreign Secretary Eden and the reasons why he wrote to Prime Minister Baldwin requesting the immediate convening of Parliament. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin recently sent a letter to Attlee, the leader of the opposition party in the House of Commons, stating that the Cabinet has rejected the proposal to immediately convene Parliament to discuss the increasingly serious situation of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. The Committee on Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War is currently investigating certain accusations. To convene Parliament four or five days earlier will not greatly benefit the committee and will not have much impact on limiting the war. When Parliament reconvenes on October 29, he will seek a debate on the situation in Spain. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) Major Attlee, Chairman of the Labor Party in the House of Commons, recently sent a letter to Prime Minister Baldwin, requesting him to immediately convene Parliament to discuss Britain's attitude towards the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. This request has recently been rejected by today's Cabinet meeting. Therefore, Parliament will still be convened on October 29 as originally scheduled. According to customary practice, Parliament will adjourn until November 3 after it convenes. This time, the practice may be broken, and the meeting will continue the next day. At that time, Labor Party members will definitely raise the Spanish issue for debate. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Madrid—The newspaper of Prime Minister Caballero today published an editorial calling on believers in democratic systems around the world to assist the Spanish left-wing government, saying that the world has been divided into two major extremes: dictatorial regimes and democratic regimes. The decisive battle between the two forces has already begun, and the current battlefield is Spain. Hitler and Mussolini both say that democratic regimes are fundamentally corrupt. Now is the time to prove that their statement is incorrect. At the same time, Foreign Minister Thalvaio has been appointed as the Supreme Military Commissioner, and the original General Staff has been abolished. (National Telegraph, 21st)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The government today sent a note to the Committee on Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War in London, stating that the Soviet Union's accusations that Germany violated the non-intervention agreement were completely unfounded, and firmly refuted the Soviet Union's accusations against Germany. At the same time, it also listed various incidents in which the Soviet Union arbitrarily violated the prohibition of the export of war materials to Spain, saying that this list was compiled based on the abundant materials obtained by the German government. The Soviet Union not only accused Germany, but also accused Italy and Portugal of violating the non-intervention agreement. The Committee on Non-Intervention requested Italy, Germany, and Portugal to explain the points accused by the Soviet Union, and requested the three countries to reply as soon as possible so that the committee could hold a meeting at the end of this week. Italy and Portugal have not yet replied. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) The Adjustment Committee for Non-Intervention Measures in the Spanish Civil War decided to convene a meeting on Friday of this week. As for the Portuguese government's reply, it will not be delivered until the beginning of next week. The reason for the delay is said to be that land telegraphic communication between Portugal and Britain has been disrupted by the Spanish Civil War. As for airmail between Portugal and Britain, the Portuguese authorities believe it is not safe. Therefore, the postal authorities here are now seeking to lay submarine cables to ensure that communication between Britain and Portugal is not disrupted. (Havas, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Paris) The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies held a meeting today, attended by Foreign Minister Delbos, who reported on general diplomatic issues. Regarding the Spanish issue, Delbos said, "If the development of the Spanish situation results in the Soviet Union being drawn into the vortex of war, France does not bear any mutual assistance obligations to the Soviet Union, because according to the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, mutual assistance obligations can only be implemented when the territory of any contracting party is attacked as a result of a confirmed act of aggression. As for the current position taken by the French government on the Spanish issue, it does not intend to make any changes." Former Prime Minister Flandin, a Republican of the Left, immediately asked the Foreign Minister what the definition of "aggression" was in the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact. Delbos replied, "Both contracting parties have the freedom to judge the nature of the 'aggressor,' and the so-called 'mutual assistance' does not have a mechanical nature. This was clearly explained to the Chamber of Deputies by the government before the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact was ratified. Moreover, the Adjustment Committee for Non-Intervention Measures in the Spanish Civil War has warned that if countries actually compete to interfere in the Spanish Civil War, it will cause serious disputes. Therefore, France deeply hopes that the next meeting of the Adjustment Committee can establish an agreement to ensure that measures for non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War are genuinely guaranteed." Someone then asked what action the government would take if the Spanish rebels won and the autonomous region of Catalonia requested assistance from France. Delbos replied, "France does not intend to take any unilateral action. All incidents that occur should be submitted to all countries that have not interfered in the Spanish Civil War for joint resolution." Regarding the declaration issued by King Leopold of Belgium last week, Delbos said that Belgium's international obligations will not be affected by the King's declaration, and said, "Before the King issued the declaration at the State Council, the French government received a phone call from Belgian Prime Minister Janson, formally guaranteeing that Belgium would not raise the issue of neutrality. Moreover, the word 'neutrality' was not mentioned in the King's declaration. This declaration was entirely for internal affairs, and its purpose was to ask the Belgian people to take special defensive measures to protect their own country's security, without having to rely on alliances with foreign countries. This is also a matter of course." (Havas, 21st)</p>

<h3 id="e59">Reorganization of the Diplomatic Lineup <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>To achieve diplomatic victory, the first requirement is good strategy, and the second is talented personnel. Recently, our diplomatic authorities have adhered to the principles of sovereign independence and territorial integrity in their diplomacy towards Japan, which can be considered a good strategy. In terms of personnel, there have also been important changes recently. In the League of Nations, since being elected as a semi-permanent member of the Council, Ambassador to the UK Guo Taiqi and Ambassador to France Gu Weijun have been appointed as China's representatives to the Council of the League of Nations. Xu Gongsu has been appointed as legal specialist of the Chinese delegation to Geneva, and Yang Yinpu as economic specialist. In the International Court of Justice, since the departure of Wang Liangchou, the League of Nations has elected Zheng Tianxi as a judge. In the United States, Ambassador Shi Zhaoji will return home soon and will be succeeded by Wang Zhengting. In the Soviet Union, Ambassador Yan Huiqing will remain in China due to illness and will be succeeded by Jiang Tingfu. Among these new diplomatic figures, except for Ambassadors Guo and Gu who are already in Europe, Zheng Tianxi, Xu Gongsu, and Yang Yinpu will travel to Geneva this week. Ambassadors Jiang and Wang will also travel to Moscow and Washington soon. These individuals come from different backgrounds and have different experiences. However, with their experience and knowledge, they will definitely be able to perform their duties satisfactorily and create a new diplomatic lineup.</p>
<p>The most important locations for Chinese diplomacy, apart from Tokyo, are Geneva, Moscow, and Washington. Although the League of Nations is not a powerful and just organization, it is better than nothing in upholding justice and striving for peace. We deeply know that relying on the League of Nations is not a good plan, but using the League of Nations to indirectly or directly provide assistance to us is an indispensable task for current diplomacy. Chinese diplomats who have made a name for themselves in Geneva include Gu Weijun, Yan Huiqing, and Shi Zhaoji, who are known as the "Three Knights of China." Since Ambassador Shi was stationed in the United States and Ambassador Yan went to Russia, the heavy responsibility of diplomacy in Europe has been entrusted to Guo Taiqi and Gu Weijun. Guo and Gu are trusted by the people for their diplomatic abilities and patriotic enthusiasm. However, League of Nations affairs are complex and numerous. Many economic, financial, legal, and administrative issues are of a technical nature. Without the research of experts to clarify their relationship with China's interests, the speaker will feel at a loss. Even a slight carelessness will cause great losses to the country. The mission of dispatching Xu Gongsu and Yang Yinpu is to remedy this difficulty. The complete lineup of the delegation will definitely be helpful in negotiations and will not be insignificant. As for the International Court of Justice, it is part of the League of Nations organization. The selection of judges is decided by the League of Nations General Assembly and Council. After Wang Chonghui's departure, the League of Nations elected Zheng Tianxi as his successor, allowing China to maintain a seat in the World Court. Although judges are not diplomats, upholding justice and judging right and wrong is also an aid to the diplomacy of weak countries.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union and the United States have the deepest relationship with the Far East. At this time of extraordinary tension in Sino-Japanese relations, Moscow and Washington should be stationed with capable, wealthy, and visionary envoys to seek diplomatic solutions for the country. Ambassadors Yan and Shi have been loyal to the diplomatic cause for decades, and their achievements and morality are respected worldwide. However, they are old and cannot bear the burden. Yan has been recuperating in Qingdao, and Shi has also been thinking of returning home for a long time. Diplomacy on the Moscow side cannot be handled by a chargé d'affaires. The Washington embassy and the Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs cannot achieve effective coordination, which is the main reason for the slow progress of diplomacy. Now, the central government has granted the requests of Yan and Shi and appointed Jiang Tingfu and Wang Zhengting as their successors. Jiang, as a historian, has opened a new chapter in domestic politics. A scholar is entrusted with the country's heavy responsibility and is sent to the Soviet Union, which should also open a new chapter for diplomacy. The nature of Sino-Soviet relations is special. Since Sino-Japanese diplomacy is still very difficult, Sino-Soviet relations should not remain in an undecided state. As for Sino-American relations, they have always been very friendly. Wang Zhengting is admired by the people of that country. In addition to increasing the friendship between China and the United States, his mission should also be to deeply investigate the policies, attitudes, and trends of that country towards Japan. He should guide the situation to enable the friendly country on the other side of the Pacific to understand China's desire for unification, construction, and national salvation, and to provide assistance within the possible scope. Acting in accordance with the times, things depend on human effort. I know that Ambassador Wang's trip is no less significant than the annual participation in the Washington Conference.</p>
<p>I recall that when the September 18 Incident occurred, our country's important overseas missions were deserted. There could be no greater diplomatic mistake than this. The lessons of the past five years should make us realize that the saying "weak countries have no diplomacy" is a deception. Only countries with incomplete diplomatic lineups have no diplomacy. Diplomacy and military affairs are both major guarantees for national survival. Now, Jiang, Wang, and others are about to set sail, and the specialist officials Xu and Yang are also about to depart. The government and the people have great expectations for these individuals. I hope everyone will work hard to live up to the country's heavy trust.</p>

Hitler Youth leader Schirach gave a speech at the meeting, announcing plans to establish organizations in Rome and Berlin to exchange new plans for the youths of the two countries. It is said that Germany will send youth leaders to Rome to study Italian political and cultural events, while Italian youth leaders sent to Germany will study German issues in Berlin. Foreign Minister Ciano expressed admiration for the Hitler Youth movement. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Yesterday was the first day of Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano's visit to Germany. Foreign Minister Neurath held a banquet last night to entertain him and delivered a welcoming speech, saying, "Since Count Ciano's arrival in our country, the two sides have exchanged views based on a sincere and friendly spirit."

<p>Prague, Czechoslovakia – The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies held a meeting today, at which Foreign Minister Krofta delivered a speech explaining the government's foreign policy. He stated that to ensure national security, the government not only relies on the League of Nations or its allies, but also deems it appropriate to have military strength as a backup. Since Germany's rearmament, the alliance treaties formed by France and the Little Entente countries would be greatly weakened if not supplemented. Supplementation means that "the obligations undertaken by each signatory country must be determined urgently, and mutual assistance agreements must be concluded with other countries." The Foreign Minister also stated that "Czechoslovakia cannot imitate Belgium's recent actions, because Czechoslovakia did not agree in advance with a great power to provide assistance if that country is attacked by another country. Therefore, when Czechoslovakia is attacked, it cannot expect that country to assist Czechoslovakia." As for the agreement reached between Germany and Austria on July 11 of this year, it can allow Italy and Germany to offset each other's influence in Austria. From this point of view, this agreement is not without its benefits. Finally, the Foreign Minister touched on the relationship between Czechoslovakia and Poland, saying, "The alliance treaty between Poland and France should be reaffirmed. The temporary tension between Poland and Czechoslovakia will naturally ease as a result. This is to be expected." (Havas Dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Biarritz – The 33rd Congress of the Radical Socialist Party opened this morning, with 1,400 representatives in attendance. The venue had twenty telephone booths set up in adjacent rooms for foreign journalists to send telegrams. However, today's meeting was only for the opening ceremony and the appointment of a credentials committee. The opening address by the party leader, the current Minister of State Daladier, will be delivered at the afternoon session. The formal debate will begin on Saturday of this week, when the report of the chairman of the party's parliamentary group, Campechi, on foreign policy and the party's attitude towards the Popular Front government, will be submitted for discussion. Although the party is dissatisfied with the occupation of factories by striking workers, considering it disruptive to society, it is generally believed that the party will not undermine the organization of the Popular Front. Most of the party's representatives still believe that the only political program that should be promoted by this parliament is the Popular Front program. In addition, after adjourning the meeting this morning, the party's senators will elect four people as representatives of all senators to declare to the Congress that they advocate the passage of resolutions to clarify that the Radical Socialist Party still respects individual property rights, civil liberties, and especially freedom of speech and freedom to work. Among these four, former Finance Minister Reynaud is also included. Reynaud has previously strongly criticized the financial policies advocated by the Popular Front parties. (Havas, 22nd)</p>

<p>London, 20th – Today's foreign exchange market was characterized by the continued weakness of forward French franc discounts, especially for the three-month term, ranging from 1.25 to 1.4375 francs. Almost all foreign exchange market participants believed that the instability of the franc was due to widespread fears of political changes in France in the next three months. French exchange traders now have to admit that the devaluation of the franc has not achieved the expected results because the general public still lacks confidence in the franc. In addition, the situation of the French budget is becoming increasingly difficult, so the public is afraid that the French government will eventually resort to raising capital.</p>

<p>Alameda – The United Airlines flying boat "Hawaii Clipper" departed from here at 3:11 PM today, officially commencing Pacific aviation passenger and mail service. Five years of painstaking management have finally culminated successfully. The "Hawaii Clipper" is flying to Manila this time, following the air routes that the "China Clipper," "Philippine Clipper," and "Hawaii Clipper" have tested in the past. This route was drawn up by famous aviator Charles Lindbergh and others in the New York United Airlines office in 1931. The "Hawaii Clipper" has four men and two women passengers this time. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Manila) The United Airlines' "Philippine Clipper" flying boat will depart from here at 6:00 AM tomorrow for Macau, and the next day will take the route via Hong Kong to fly back to Manila. This will be the first flight of all United Airlines' flying boats to the Asian continent.

<p>Providence – President Roosevelt gave a speech in front of the State Capitol building here today, starting his campaign in the New England industrial states, which traditionally belong to the Republican Party. 30,000 people supporting the President warmly cheered, and even the police had difficulty maintaining order. Today's speech by the President was in response to recent campaign speeches made by Republicans, denying that the government has any intention of collectivizing the people. The President said, "We cannot allow a selfish minority to collectivize the people and turn them into a breadline class, leading to economic bankruptcy. In terms of money, the economy has gradually recovered, but the word 'prosperity' has a higher meaning, that is, permanent security. We do not want prosperity like that of 1929. True prosperity should ensure that every American family has a safe home, retirement savings, and a fixed job. You have heard a lot about collectivization. In the so-called era of prosperity in those years, you also suffered a lot. This kind of situation is a kind of collectivization, which is what I oppose, because people are more important than machines. Therefore, we believe that America's material resources should serve the people." As the President left, he boarded an open car to the train station. An elderly black man jumped on the car and said to the President, "Would you also like to shake this black hand?" The President smiled and replied, "You know I would," and shook his hand, to great cheers from the crowd. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>Massachusetts – President Roosevelt passed through Fall River, Massachusetts, en route to Boston. The people here welcomed the President so enthusiastically that a serious incident almost occurred, because the number of welcomers was too crowded, and the police force was broken through. In the chaos, the arm bones of three children were broken, and many others were knocked to the ground and injured by trampling. When the President arrived in Boston, there were more than 100,000 welcomers, gathered in the square, listening to the President's speech. The authorities had no choice but to call in the militia to assist the police in protecting the President and maintaining order. Several women fainted in the crowd. Apart from this, no other incidents occurred. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Phoenix – Republican presidential candidate Landon gave a speech here today, attacking the Democratic government, accusing it of delaying to get through this election and then organizing a strict dictatorship. He also said that the current restrictions on food and other control plans are a preview of the party's policies in the next four years. At that time, women will no longer be able to wear silk stockings, but will replace them with cotton stockings, and men will also give up farming and dig trenches. Therefore, the fundamental issue of this election is whether we should continue the current political system or succumb to the dictatorship prevalent in other countries, that is, the rulers hold all the power, and the people are only allowed to enjoy incomplete freedom.

<p>(Tokyo) Mr. Sansom, the British Commercial Attaché in Japan, visited Mr. Matsushima, Director of the Bureau of Commerce of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on the afternoon of the 21st and handed over a document from Ambassador Clive to Foreign Minister Arita, announcing the abrogation of the Japan-India Commercial Treaty. The contents of the document are as follows: On October 31, the British government, in accordance with Article 6 of the Japan-India Commercial Treaty signed in London on July 12, 1934, announced the abrogation of this treaty. However, the Indian government still intends to continue the current Japan-India negotiations and hopes for a satisfactory conclusion. If such an agreement can be reached, the British government can withdraw this announcement of abrogation of the treaty. The attached letter explaining the reason for the abrogation of the treaty stated that the Indian government did not take this action out of malice towards Japanese commerce, but solely to protect Indian manufacturing in the event of a breakdown in negotiations. (Domei, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram recently received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the Consul-General in India, the Indian Ministry of Commerce announced on the 19th that the Ottawa Agreement would remain in effect until a new agreement is concluded between Britain and India. India has abrogated the Japan-India Commercial Treaty on the one hand, and announced the extension of the Ottawa Agreement on the other. This can be seen as a move by Britain to strengthen its imperial alliance, which is quite noteworthy. (Domei, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs knew early on that the British government would announce the abrogation of the Japan-India Commercial Treaty on the 21st and had studied countermeasures. Therefore, it does not regard the official announcement as a major issue. The purpose of the Japan-India talks currently underway in Delhi is to revise the supplementary protocol to the Japan-India Commercial Treaty. These talks should continue until March next year. The Japan-India Commercial Treaty does not have a set expiration date and recognizes most-favored-nation treatment for Japan. Therefore, if the Japan-India talks fail, the provision in the supplementary protocol regarding the barter system cannot be established, and India must still recognize most-favored-nation treatment for Japan. The United Kingdom, in order to prevent Japan from invoking this provision, first announced the abrogation of the treaty. However, if the Japan-India treaty can be concluded satisfactorily, the Japan-India commercial relationship will not be affected in any way. (Domei, 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e70">Reasons for Soaring Grain Prices in Jiaodong: A Certain Country Secretly Instructing Unscrupulous Merchants to Export Grain, County Magistrates Request Provincial Government to Strictly Prohibit <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Although the counties in Eastern Shandong have had a bumper harvest this year, grain prices have been soaring recently, causing great suffering to poor farmers. According to Laiyang County Magistrate Liang Bingkun and Weixian County Magistrate Li Wenli, the reason for the recent soaring grain prices is that people from a certain country are secretly instructing unscrupulous merchants to purchase grain for export. The provincial government, upon receiving the report, believes that the purchase of grain for export is of great importance to the people's livelihood and must be strictly prohibited in order to provide relief. On the 20th, it submitted a proposal to the provincial political affairs meeting for discussion. It was decided to hand it over to the three departments of civil affairs, finance, and construction to plan the prohibition measures, and the Civil Affairs Department was to convene a meeting. The proposal stated, "Laiyang County Magistrate Liang Bingkun's telegram stated: According to reports, grain prices in Jiaodong have recently risen sharply because people from a certain country are secretly instructing unscrupulous merchants to purchase grain for export. In addition to ordering subordinates to strictly prohibit the export of grain to maintain the people's livelihood, may we ask if we can issue a general order to all counties in Jiaodong to uniformly prohibit it? Weili County Magistrate Li Wenli's telegram stated: According to the report from Ma Chuanfang, Director of the Fangzi Sub-bureau of the County Public Security Bureau, the Tiancheng Oil Stack and the Railway Consumer Cooperative in this town are purchasing large quantities of wheat for export, resulting in soaring grain prices and affecting the people's economy. Can we prohibit it? Please give instructions. This county has prohibited the export of grain due to soaring grain prices. The township and town chiefs of this county have requested that a notice be issued to prohibit it and have submitted a report to request instructions for compliance. Considering the aforementioned reasons, can we prohibit the export of grain? Please send a telegram to us quickly to indicate compliance." How should we handle this? Please make a public decision.</p>
<h3 id="e71">After the Completion of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway: Hunan Rice Will Be Transported and Sold to Guangdong Province, Foreign Rice Will Be Sold at Discounted Prices <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Guangdong Province lacks food, so it relies on imports to supplement its supply. Each year, more than 30 million yuan worth of foreign rice is imported from places such as Siam and Annam. In Shantou alone, the average monthly import of foreign rice is 250,000 bags (180 catties per bag). Because the Chaozhou and Meizhou counties have many mountains and few fields, and a dense population, the local rice production is only enough to feed the people for three months. In the past, Guangdong Province established a special agricultural tax, collecting more than two yuan in special tax for every 100 catties of foreign rice imported, or about four yuan per bag. The tax revenue was quite considerable, but the people suffered. After the Guangdong situation changed, the special tax on foreign rice was abolished and replaced by customs duties collected by the Customs Office. Customs duties of 1.6 yuan were collected for every 100 kilograms, or more than two yuan per dan. However, after the collection of customs duties was changed, the smuggling of rice by foreign firms has disappeared. Although the people who eat rice feel the heavy burden, the government's tax revenue has greatly benefited. The Shantou grain market has undergone a transformation. The monopoly by a certain combination society that was tax-exempt has now been returned to the free operation of Chinese merchants from the North and South. It is found that the base of the North-South merchants is in the rice industry of Hong Kong, Siam, and Saigon. The North-South merchants have a close relationship with the rice industry. Over the years, a large amount of foreign rice has been transported to Guangzhou and Shantou for sale by special ships of the North-South merchants. The amount of leaks is self-evident. Since the opening of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, the harvests in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces have been plentiful this year. The Hunan and Guangdong authorities are implementing economic cooperation. It is reported that it has been decided to transport Hunan rice to Guangdong and Guangdong salt to Hunan. The Guangdong-Hankou Railway can be used for transportation. The Ministry of Railways, in order to revive the national economy, has decided to reduce the freight charges for transporting rice by half. Furthermore, a general transportation office will be established in Hunan through official-merchant cooperation to purchase rice and transport it to Guangzhou for sale. After the rice arrives in Guangzhou, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships will be chartered to transport it to Shantou. This matter has been largely determined, and 400,000 bags of Hunan rice have been purchased and stored between Changsha and Hengyang waiting for transportation. Therefore, in the near future, Hunan rice will be sold in large quantities in Guangdong. Chen Huanzhang, Chairman of the Shantou Chamber of Commerce, upon hearing about the official-merchant cooperation in transporting Hunan rice, went to the province last week to participate in the negotiations. He also telegraphed the Shantou Hefusheng Rice Store to bring a large sum of money to the province to negotiate the establishment of a Shantou Hunan rice distribution point. Upon hearing the news, the Shantou Grain Association believed that Chen Huanzhang's actions were tantamount to monopolizing and manipulating the food supply of Chaozhou and Meizhou. Because the import tax on foreign rice is heavy and Hunan rice will be monopolized by a small number of people, the Rice Association has repeatedly held meetings to oppose it and sent people to Hong Kong to contact the North-South merchants to cope with the plan of monopolizing the people's food by transporting Hunan rice. As a result, the North-South merchants intend to increase their capital and establish foreign rice sales offices in Guangzhou and Shantou. The rice industry in Siam, Saigon, and Yangon is also willing to be a backing. Furthermore, a large amount of foreign rice is being transported in, and the market price has fallen sharply. However, the price has risen slightly because Hunan rice has not yet arrived. Top quality rice is about eight yuan per bag, and medium quality rice is 7.7 yuan (Central Reserve Bank notes). The cost is even cheaper than the price of rice in Shanghai. There are currently 200,000 bags in stock on the market, and another 250,000 bags are arriving in port in a few days. It is found that Chaozhou and Meizhou need 3 million bags of foreign rice for supply each year, and Guangdong province as a whole needs more than 10 million bags each year. It is expected that when the first batch of Hunan rice transported by the Guangdong-Hankou Railway arrives in Guangdong, there will be a major change in the food market.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Certain Nationals Actively in Shishi Town, Quanzhou: More Than Two Hundred Nationals of a Certain Country Arrive in Shishi <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>A certain party guides the revival of the smuggling agency. Xiamen Correspondence: Shishi Town in the third district of Jinjiang County outside the South Gate of Quanzhou is the most prosperous town in Quanzhou Prefecture. Its location is close to the sea, and there are roads reaching all directions. Its water and land transportation are convenient. Its commercial freight is the hub. The commercial districts and residential houses are densely packed. 80-90% of its residents are families of overseas Chinese from the Philippines. In recent years, due to economic decline and the dumping of smuggled goods, the commercial situation is not as good as before. However, its importance remains no less than before. Moreover, the third district is located on the coast, with 18 coastal ports that are deep enough to dock giant ships. It is also an important place for national defense in southern Fujian. A certain party is paying close attention to this area and is actively immigrating people here. According to recent investigations, more than 200 nationals of a certain country have come to Shishi in recent years. Most of them are doctors, medicine sellers, buyers of old silver and broken silver, and smugglers. A group of unregistered nationals, including Chen Zifa and Zhang Youdong, came to Shishi with their own bicycles, ostensibly selling medicine, and toured the villages, towns, and seaports. The Shishi Third District Office has ordered its subordinates to pay close attention to them. Also, Wang Xianzhang, a Taiwanese, came to Shishi last year and established the Taiyuan Hospital on Chenggong Street. Recently, he invited several of his fellow villagers, all intellectuals, to Shishi to open a general store on Majiao Street, called the Mengya Department Store. He is very active in Shishi and socializes with people from all walks of life in the local area. On this year's National Day, they independently organized the Mengya New Drama Society (without the permission of the organizing committee for the National Day celebrations) and performed a new drama in Xucupu, Shishi. Because the plot insulted China and contained certain propaganda, the authorities stopped it and sent people to monitor their actions. Later, Hong Chun, the manager of the Chuntai Department Store, guaranteed that they would not engage in reactionary propaganda, otherwise they would be deported. It is found that foreign nationals and nationals of foreign countries can only reside in treaty ports such as Xiamen. Those who go to the interior must obtain travel passports and cannot reside there. But in fact, nationals of a certain country are already intermingled in southern Quanzhou.</p>
<p>According to the Quanzhou-Xiamen Daily, the coast of southern Jinjiang, separated from Taiwan by a strip of water, has always been a place for unscrupulous merchants to operate. Smuggling is rampant, leading the way in southern Fujian. Recently, because the anti-smuggling agencies on the coast, such as the tax inspection offices, have been abolished, Liu, the owner of a certain store in Jinjiang Tatou (originally reported as Liu Ankuan of Jixing Firm), Chen, the owner of a certain firm in Shenhu (Chen Yong'an of Hemaoxing Firm), and Chen, the owner of a certain firm (Chen Tian of Longsheng Firm), Huang Yansui of Xunpu (Huang's smuggling agency was cracked on September 13, and Huang is on the run), and Cai Peiqing of Shishi, who was executed last winter, have organized the Nanchang Company as a major smuggling agency. He Gongca, the manager of the company (known as the "boss"), has sneaked back to Shishi from Taipei Keelung by smuggling electric boat to carry out large-scale activities, and has also contacted Qiu of Dongpu (known as the "local emperor") and Huang, a national of a certain country (named Ziao), and uses a certain party's electric boat to transport goods from Keelung to Dongpu, setting up several warehouses in Dapu Township, five miles from Shishi, and using donkeys and horses to transfer smuggled goods into the interior at dusk and at night to cover people's eyes and ears. It is found that after Cai Peiqing was executed, the capital of the Nanchang Company was scattered. Now it has received funding from a certain party and has sent people to guide it, so its power is even stronger. The general company is located in Dongpu Township, and the office is located in Shishi City. As for He Gongca himself, his whereabouts are secretive, and he is always accompanied by several armed bodyguards when he travels. (October 21)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Xu Zhou Grain Prices Soar; People’s Food Prospects Cause for Concern; Weather Excessively Dry; Wheat Planting Missed <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Xu Zhou correspondence: Since the years of floods, Xu Zhou has been in a state where low grain prices hurt farmers. However, the cause of low grain prices is by no means due to affluent farmers dumping surplus grain. It is actually because farmers are in debt and must sell their new grain quickly to repay debts upon harvest. Thus, even with consecutive good harvests, the bankruptcy of rural areas remains unchanged. This year, the spring and autumn harvests were both abundant. Although there is no excess of grain, there is no shortage either. However, in the past two months, the weather has been excessively dry, making it difficult to plant spring wheat. Moreover, after two seasons of good harvests, grain is being transported out of the area, leading to reduced reserves. As a result, grain prices have soared, almost reaching one-third of the original price. The people of Xu Zhou mainly rely on wheat for food. The supply of flour mainly comes from the Shi Xing Flour Company in the port area, and there are many small mills in the city and countryside. As the price of Baoxing flour has increased with the price of grain, the price of flour from small mills has also risen sharply. The price, which was usually five or six cents per catty, has recently increased to over eight cents. The poor are suffering greatly. Small farmers in the countryside never store grain. As soon as the new grain is harvested, it is sold off. Now they must buy food at high prices. Although grain prices are not low, the harm to farmers remains the same, which is a deep cause for social concern.</p>
<p>The Xu Bei area suffered from the Yellow River flooding last year, with vast areas turned into watery marshes. In the past autumn and this spring, embankments were built twice, exhausting the people's strength. Just as they were seeking respite, locusts suddenly appeared on the west bank of Wei Lake, extending seven or eight li in length and thirty square li in width. They are currently laying eggs and breeding. The residents along the lake are in a state of panic and are uniting to eradicate them in the hope of eliminating the nymph stage as a scourge. Fortunately, the Yellow River is calm this year, so there should be no flooding. However, the drought is a concern. If it does not rain again, wheat planting will be missed, and a spring famine next year is likely to be expected (19th).</p>

When the victim resisted slightly, he was shot, with two bullets hitting his right leg. His relative, Liu Ake, was disheartened by what he saw and turned to flee, but was also shot and injured. Seeing that they had already caused trouble, the robbers fled with four bales of cotton. This case has been reported to Song Jiang.

<p>The rice crops in various townships of this county had a bumper harvest this autumn. Currently, it is the busy season for harvesting. However, amidst these reports of a good harvest, the Agricultural Commerce Association received a report from Li Zilian, the town head of Chefang Town in the Eighth District, stating that the rice seedlings in Shangqing and four other villages in the district were showing signs of dying due to recent continuous tides, heavy fog, and a rise in temperature. He requested an investigation. Upon receiving the report, the Association sent six land survey officers to the villages today (the 23rd) to conduct an on-site investigation to clarify the truth. After the county government reported to the Finance Department that it would collect land taxes at 94.4%, it was instructed not to do so and to collect the full amount. County Magistrate Deng, considering the difficulties of the landowners, has submitted a further report to the Finance Department stating his reasons and requesting that the previous report be approved. Meanwhile, various pawnshops are preparing to collect rent. However, the rent collection this year has changed from previous methods and is now handled by the county government. The landowners must pay a collection fee of 12 cents per picul. All rent collection personnel are temporarily hired by the county government and sent to various villages to collect rent. The village leaders still exist and are responsible for guiding the tenants. As for the land rent disposal office, it remains organized as before in order to arrest and pursue recalcitrant tenants.</p>

<p>The Wu County Public Security authorities, aware of the recent activities of reactionary elements disguised as beggars in the cities and countryside, disrupting public order, detained one person named Pan, who has been sent to the Jiangyin garrison for investigation. They also detained over a hundred beggars but released them as they were not involved. On the 21st, Wang Yutian, a police officer from the 7th station of the 2nd branch, arrested a well-mannered suspected beggar in Heng Street, Fengmen. He claimed to be Wu Hongsheng from Hang County, Zhejiang Province, and a graduate of Zhejiang Chongwen Middle School, who had worked as a teacher and a police officer. A piece of paper with Arabic coded messages was found on him, the purpose of which is unknown. He is suspected of being a traitor and was sent to the Public Security Bureau on the 22nd to await investigation.</p>

<p>The prices of cotton yarn and cloth in the city have been soaring for days. It has been learned that the price of flour is also gradually increasing due to strong sales. The sentiment in the market is very firm. The opening price on the 21st was 3.7 yuan per bag for Green Mountain Deer and Green Barracks, and 3.6 yuan for Green Mountain Deer, an increase of 25 cents compared to the price a few days ago. The reason for the increase is the high price of wheat, the scarcity of sources, and the fact that flour wheat from the north has been completely collected by a certain country, which is now absorbing as much as possible from Shanghai. In addition, speculators are taking the opportunity to buy in large quantities, creating a new record that has rarely been seen recently. The Maoxin One and Two factories and the Jiufeng Flour Factory in this city currently have a total of over 200,000 bags of flour in stock, but they are reluctant to sell because they expect prices to rise further. The rice market in the city has also surged by 20-30 cents, with clear white rice at 9.5 yuan and powdered rice at 9.1 yuan. The reason is that Shaanxi, Beijing, Shanghai, and Nantong are continuing to purchase, but the sources are extremely scarce, the market is very firm, and there is fear that prices will continue to rise.</p>

<p>Recently, the county government and the Public Security Bureau, deeply concerned that local bullies and vagrants are setting up gambling dens to defraud farmers of their property as the new grain harvest comes to market, have formulated three measures to prohibit gambling and instructed the baojia heads to report them. The measures are: (1) If gambling is taking place in public places or places accessible to the public within the baojia, it is the duty of the baojia head to give prior warning and eliminate it invisibly. If they knowingly conceal or protect it, they will be punished according to law once discovered. (2) If there are local ruffians who do not engage in proper business and specialize in gathering to gamble and skimming profits, the baojia head should report them at any time to maintain local peace. (3) If the baojia head secretly reports the above-mentioned places gathering to gamble to the nearest public security agency, and it is subsequently discovered, a portion of the fine will be awarded as a reward.

<p>Since the beginning of summer this year, the climate has been mild and the rainfall has been timely and even, so agricultural products such as cotton, rice, and soybeans have grown luxuriantly, resulting in good harvests. Farmers in general have been beaming with joy. However, since the beginning of autumn, the weather has been dry for nearly two months without rain. At this time of autumn plowing, the prolonged drought has caused the fields to crack and cultivation is difficult. Crops such as wheat, vegetables, and broad beans urgently need to be planted, so farmers are eagerly hoping for rain. If it does not rain again, it will become a drought. Some farmers are drawing water into the fields to plant wheat. This type of drought is rare in recent years. As a result, vegetables in the market are expensive, and cases of malignant malaria have been reported, causing public panic.</p>

The fire was so fierce that it spread to the homes of neighbors Zhao Hengli, Wang Bingyuan, Huang Wanyuan, Qin Yuhai, Yang Jushan, Xu Wu, Ju Rongxi, Chen Er, Pan Haifu, Ding Huannian, and others, totaling fifteen families. It took an hour to put out the fire. Approximately twenty grass huts were burned down, with losses amounting to 800-900 yuan. Yang Jushan suffered the greatest loss, with over 20 piculs of beans burned.</p>

<p>In this county, not a drop of rain has fallen in the past two months, and farmers in various villages have been unable to plant wheat. Locusts have suddenly appeared in the Dong Township, and eight or nine out of ten of the planted wheat seedlings have been eaten. Farmers are all complaining. In the fields of the Seventh District of Lake West, the soil is cracked due to the long period without rain, and wheat cannot be planted. There is a great need for rain.</p>

<p>Jiang Hongming, the township head of Jiudian Township in Jiangdu's Ninth District, based on the petition of 15 villagers including Yang Yulin, stated that they have suffered from drought and famine for four years, and the people's livelihood is in decline. This is all due to the lack of water conservancy repairs. They convened a meeting to discuss relief measures and decided to build a water trough on the Yanglin Bridge River in the township to draw water for irrigation. However, although they are prepared to buy the land occupied by the trough line, they fear arbitrary demands will prevent progress. They requested a submission of a report. The report was submitted to the county on the 20th, requesting instructions. The county government has ordered the district office to carefully plan the purchase price and report back for approval.</p>

<p>After actively accelerating the construction of the Nanping section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, earthwork has progressed rapidly and is 90% complete. The construction of the Ganjiang Bridge and over 70 bridges along the line has been particularly smooth due to the long period of sunny and dry weather. Paving work is now starting in three sections: (1) Chang to the east bank of the Ganjiang River; (2) the west bank of the Ganjiang River to Pingxiang; (3) Pingxiang to the west bank of the Ganjiang River. All work is scheduled to be completed by the end of June next year, and it will connect with the Yuehan Road for traffic from July 1st.</p>

<p>East Lake in Yindong is the irrigation water source for the farmland along the lake in Yin, Zhen, and Feng counties. The lake has a total area of 22.9 square kilometers, fed by 72 streams that converge to form the lake. The water veins are interconnected, as dense as a spider's web. The irrigated area reaches 509,000 mu. Due to years of disrepair, the dams and locks are silted up, resulting in water shortages during droughts and significant losses to agriculture. Officials and local people have repeatedly advocated dredging, but due to limited funding, it has been delayed until now. As a result of the efforts of local gentry this spring, the Zhejiang Provincial Government approved the project and allocated 100,000 yuan in public bonds. The Committee for Land Improvement of East Lake was established and is actively carrying out repairs to the locks and dams. The Third Provisional Meeting recently resolved to establish an office in the lake area to facilitate active planning and implementation. The office held an inauguration ceremony on the morning of the 20th at the Yue Temple in Xiguadun, Mozhiyan. Zhou Zhenlun, the chief of the Engineering Office of the Department of Construction, was specially dispatched to Ningbo to participate. Zhuang Songfu, the chairman of the committee, Zhao Juesheng, the commissioner of the Sixth District, Chen Baolin, the county magistrate of Yin County, and others also attended. After the establishment of the office, construction and repairs will begin selectively.</p>

<p>Due to the absence of rain in Xiaocheng for one and a half months, the city river has dried up. The water level in the area around the West Gate and South Gate is less than an inch, so boats cannot pass and traffic is cut off. The water outside the Southeast Gate is also shallower than usual. As farmland requires water for sowing wheat, beans, and cabbage, water is pumped out day and night, causing the river to dry up even more. Drinking water in the city is dirty, and epidemics are spreading. If it does not rain again, the spring flowers in the fields may not germinate, and if a fire breaks out in the city, there will be no way to extinguish it.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Recent Situation in Guangdong and Guangxi (8): The Sharp Increase in Unemployment <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>-- This newspaper reporter, Xiao An</p>
<p>Gambling and opium have always been major scourges in Guangdong. Now, gambling has been banned, and the government has established an anti-smoking committee to phase out opium. However, the problem of public unemployment seems also to be one of the major scourges in Guangdong. The number of unemployed people is staggering, even in Guangzhou alone. The reasons for unemployment are no more than two: one is that farmers leave their villages and gather in cities to seek a way out; the other is the decline of industry and commerce, with workers and shop employees being abandoned as a result. Therefore, Guangzhou has become a breeding ground for unemployment. According to a recent survey by the City Public Security Bureau on the city's household population, there are 115,966 unemployed people and 39,421 non-productive people, while there are 600,947 employed people. Statistics show that one out of seven citizens in Guangzhou is unemployed, and the unemployment problem in Guangzhou may become a serious social problem.</p>
<p>The number of unemployed intellectuals is also considerable. Intellectuals mostly rely on Party, military, government, and academic institutions for their livelihoods. In this political transition, some institutions at all levels have been abolished entirely, some have had a large number of personnel replaced, and some have reduced their scope and laid off personnel extensively. The Southwest Executive Department, the Southwest Political Affairs Conference, and the General Headquarters of the First Army Group, which were the highest Party, military, and government organs in the past, were abolished entirely. The three highest institutions, together with their subordinate institutions, employed more than 10,000 people. These more than 10,000 people have become completely unemployed. In addition, the provincial government and its departments have replaced their chiefs. Most of the old staff could not continue their positions. For example, the Department of Civil Affairs, which originally had six sections, was merged into five. The Departments of Finance and Construction, which each had six sections, were merged into four. Due to the merger of sections, large-scale layoffs were carried out as much as possible. In the Department of Finance, 80 or more support staff were laid off alone. Currently, three people's work in each section is now done by only one person. This is just one example. The municipal government abolished the entire Education Bureau, Public Works Bureau, and new power plant, resulting in nearly a thousand unemployed people. At the same time, many principals of municipal schools were replaced, and teachers at these schools were also eliminated by the new forces. Therefore, the outcry for unemployment in intellectual circles is growing higher. Since there are many unemployed people, there are even more people seeking jobs. It is said that there are at least 1,500 to 2,000 people with recommendation letters approaching various departments of the provincial government, and although the number of people approaching the municipal government and various bureaus is slightly less, there are at least 500 to 600 people in each office. In addition to employing those introduced by influential people and those they trust, the heads of various institutions generally keep those seeking jobs at arm's length. Therefore, secretaries and clerks are often assigned to meet visitors on their behalf, and some have even stipulated that they will only meet visitors for two days a week, and only for one hour each day. This clearly implies a rejection of job seekers. In addition, after the establishment of the provincial government, 1,500 people have been seeking county magistrate positions. Considering that there are a total of 91 counties in the province, an average of more than 10 people are vying for the position of county magistrate in each county. Therefore, the Department of Civil Affairs is facing great difficulties, and this is why the county magistrates of the various counties have been changed so slowly. In addition, the officers' corps organized by the four headquarters is intended to accommodate and train unemployed soldiers. When the four headquarters announced the establishment of the corps, more than 3,000 officers and adjutants who had been laid off applied. There are still a considerable number who have not applied. It is said that these unemployed soldiers are those who previously worked in the General Headquarters of the First Army Group and were laid off. In addition, Cen Xuelu, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, was ordered to recruit clerks, intending to take in 50 people, but more than 3,000 people applied. Based on these facts, the sharp increase in the number of unemployed people can be seen. In addition, there are still unemployed people who cannot be found out, such as the several thousand gambling houses throughout the province in the past, with at least tens of thousands of people working in them. After the ban on gambling, the government has not made any arrangements for them. Also, the government has strictly prohibited fortune-telling, but fortune-tellers have not been able to change their profession for a while, and the government has not provided any follow-up solutions. Thus, the number of unemployed people has increased. Because there are so many unemployed people, strong men have become bandits, and the old and weak have become beggars. In the past few years, the waterways of the Sanjiang River have been quite safe, but now there are reports of unrest among bandits. In addition, in cities and towns such as Guangzhou, Jiangmen, and Foshan, there were beggars in the past who begged for money on the streets and roads, but now the situation is even worse. This is probably the result of too many unemployed people. If there are no good ways to deal with the unemployed, I am afraid it will not be a blessing for Guangdong in the end.</p>

<h3 id="e91">The City's Fourth Annual Municipal Games Open Yesterday; More Than 10,000 People Attend; President Pan Delivers Opening Address; Drill Performance by 3,000 Students is Quite Spectacular; Various Sports Activities Begin at 9:00 AM Today <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The opening of the fourth annual municipal games took place at the municipal sports grounds in the central district at 10:00 AM yesterday. With a gentle breeze, brilliant sunshine, and a clear sky, all sports activities were able to proceed smoothly. Details of the opening and competition are recorded separately below:</p>
<h3 id="e92">Opening Ceremony: Opening Situation <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The opening ceremony of the conference was held at 10:00 a.m., presided over by President Pan Gongzhan, the Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs. Attendees included Central Committee member Chu Minyi, Lin Meiyan of the City Party Department, Huang Shaoxiong of the City Board of Education, Lu Jingshi of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Li Dachao, Zhang Tingrong, Tang Shixuan of the Municipal Government, Shen Yi, Director of the Public Works Bureau, over 100 conference staff members including Shao Ruzuo, Zhang Binghui, Jiang Jianbai Ma Chonggan Ling Xitao Wang Fudan Wang Keyong Lin Yunsheng Fang Wanbang Zhang Yuanyuan Zhang Yuansheng, as well as over 10,000 athletes in attendance. Participating groups in the drill performance were in the arena ahead of the band.</p>
<p>President Delivers Address</p>
<p>President Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Bureau, delivered the opening address, stating that today is the opening ceremony of the fourth annual municipal games. This year's municipal games are the result of the merger of the middle school joint sports meet, with the addition of open, university, sports school, and national martial arts groups. In other words, with the exception of primary schools, amateur athletes from this city are performing on the field. The meaning of the games is already well understood and does not need to be repeated. Sports are the work of changing the physique, and attention should be paid to training the body at all times and in all places. The conference is a manifestation of ordinary training achievements. Although prizes are awarded, one should not exercise for the sake of prizes, otherwise the true meaning of sports will be lost. Mayor Wu Tiecheng was unable to attend due to business, but asked to extend his regards on his behalf, wishing all groups in the city to work hard to promote physical fitness, join the ranks of the great powers, and seek equality.</p>
<p>Athletes Take Oath</p>
<p>After the President's address, Leng Peigen was designated as the athlete representative to take the oath on the stage. All athletes raised their right hands and swore the oath, which stated: "We solemnly uphold the spirit of physical education advocated by President Sun Yat-sen, maintain the qualifications of amateur athletes, participate in the competition, obey the referees, and strictly abide by all the rules of the conference."</p>
<p>Party Department Delivers Address</p>
<p>Subsequently, Lin Meiyan, the representative of the City Party Department, delivered an address, stating that he was very happy to represent the City Party Department in participating in the conference. The strength and weakness of modern countries is generally determined by two points: material and spiritual. The United States and Germany have both of these points and have achieved strength and revival. Our country is founded on the Three Principles of the People, which includes these two major points. Others call us the "sick man of East Asia" because of our backwardness in spirit and material. To wash away this shame, we must revitalize our spirit and construct our material base. The extension of working hours is the extension of life, and only then can we engage in all undertakings. Therefore, we must work hard in physical education. I hope you will strive to follow this path. After the address, the ceremony was completed, and the athletes exited. The drill performance and competition then began.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Student Drills: As Many as 3,000 People <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>After the opening ceremony, 3,000 male and female students from various schools gathered, wearing various school uniforms, with the shorter ones in front and the taller ones in the back. They were led into the arena in succession by the leaders of each school, first parading around the sports field, and then standing on the symbols of each performance according to the positions shown in the arrangement diagram. Shao Ruzuo, the commander-in-chief of the conference, then began the drill. The movements were neat and the performance was skilled, adding a lot of color to the conference.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Group Performances: With German-Style Programs <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's group exercises consisted of eighteen sections. The de-escalation fist of Chengzhong Middle School in the middle school group was purely German-style, with four or five hundred athletes all bare-chested and barefooted, in excellent spirits. Before the performance, they raised their right hands to salute in the style of the German National Socialist Party. When the team was in formation, the drums rumbled, as if facing a great enemy, which was truly unprecedented in Shanghai. The bench exercises of the private Shangzhong Middle School, with each person holding a bench in their hands, turning and dancing left and right, were skillful and powerful, which certainly impressed the audience. The physical fitness activities of the Chinese Women's Physical Education Normal School in the physical education school group were derived from the German-style natural dance. Barefoot and bare-armed, they were extremely athletic. The performance was also accompanied by drums, which was the same as the de-escalation fist of Chengzhong, which can be said to be a coincidence. The equipment exercises of the East Asia Institute of Physical Education, performing parallel bars, were unique and not accidental, which won a lot of applause. In addition, the fitness exercises of the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Normal School, the Party Emblem exercises of the Shanghai North Middle School, and the fitness dance of the Huadong Girls' Middle School were all interesting and skilled.</p>
<h3 id="e95">No Tickets Sold: The Public Can Watch: Unfinished Programs From Yesterday To Be Rescheduled Today <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>(1) The unfinished programs from yesterday will be held starting at 9:00 AM today. Referees are expected to arrive at the venue early to serve. (2) No tickets will be sold for the conference for three days, and the public is free to enter and leave to watch.

<h3 id="e96">Track and Field Championship Situation: Men's College Belongs to Chizhi; Women's Belongs to Datia; East Asia to Dominate Both Men's and Women's Groups in Physical Education School; Jiao Yulian, Qiu Guangxun, and Zhang Liang Had Good Results <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The track and field programs yesterday, open, college, and physical education school groups have completed most of them. In addition to relays and all-around events left for tomorrow, these three groups can be fully distinguished today. However, the championship situation has been mostly decided, such as the men's college belonging to Chizhi, the women's belonging to Datia, and the men's and women's groups in the physical education school being dominated by East Asia. In terms of results, Jiao Yulian's 100 meters, Qiu Guangxun's high jump, and Zhang Liang's 1500 meters were all not bad, but Dai Shuguo's 400 meters for Li Peide was unexpected. Chen Rongtang's discus throwing was not as strong as in the past.</p>

<p>News from the Venue</p>
<p>The grand assembly of two thousand male and female students was a magnificent scene. From the variety of outfits, it was as if a giant pattern had been woven. Looking down from a high vantage point, it was truly beautiful. It is said that even the distinguished guests, such as Chu Taiji, couldn't help but applaud.</p>
<p>Chinese Women's Teacher Training College Fitness Activities (Order)</p>
<p>Junior High Girls Shot Put First Place: Shen Qixian (International) of Chinese Women's High School</p>
<p>During the group exercise performance, the "Stripping for Battle Boxing" from Chengzhong High School and the "Fitness Activities" from the Chinese Women's Teacher Training College, one bare-chested and the other washing feet, were uniquely matched. It is said that these two performances were observed and brought back from the Olympic Games by Wang Huaihong and Du Yufei.</p>
<p>Yesterday, fewer than 10,000 people attended. Besides students from various schools, very few guests attended, so there were many gaps around the grandstand. Compared with the National Games last year, the atmosphere was completely different, which evoked a sense of vicissitude.</p>
<p>Several female teachers from various schools were found wearing brightly colored outfits inside and outside the stadium yesterday, but they were only fleeting glimpses. Although girls' schools have recently promoted bans on perms and makeup, there were still quite a few female students with airplane-shaped perms yesterday.</p>
<p>There were very few spectators in the martial arts venue yesterday, and most people didn't pay attention. In fact, that was the most interesting venue. The wrestling instructor of the Chinese Martial Arts Research Association led his entire team to perform weapons. This man was in high spirits and gave a wonderful performance.</p>
<p>In the group exercises, the "Mock War" performance of Minzhi Middle School had the spirit of the Italian Balilla, falling and rolling on the field, which was very energetic. The training of young people in China today should be like this, not just the beautiful poses of a dance and turning into a pampered son.</p>
<p>During the 100-meter preliminary race, Luo Ruilan of Liangjiang fell and injured herself. She was carried to the infirmary, but no one was there. The platform shouted "An athlete is injured, the medical staff come quickly!" It was not until fifteen minutes later that someone slowly arrived, saying, "This is not an acute illness."</p>
<p>Among the schools participating in the physical education school group this time, only Southeast Women's Teacher Training College was missing. Also, Nanyang Model High School has always paid attention to sports. I remember that the school did not participate in the last elementary school joint games, and this time it did not participate in the secondary school games.</p>

<p>The Donghua football team played two friendly matches in a row yesterday and today to test the players who will participate in the Shanghai League reserve team. The match against John's the day before was to test the strength of new recruits. Yesterday's match against the Central Minting Plant team was to test the established official lineup, so no one was replaced from beginning to end. As a result, right forward Tang Yingheng scored three goals in the first half, and Jia Jiliang and Shu Shigeng scored two more goals in the second half. The result was a big win with five goals to zero. After this test, Donghua will probably use this lineup as the basis for future reserve team games. However, Sun Baoqing was absent yesterday due to personal matters, and Zhang Rongcai was a substitute. In the future, the goalkeeper position will still be given to Sun Baoqing. Yesterday's Donghua lineup was as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai</p>
<p>Pan Hongzhang, Xie Guoren</p>
<p>Jin Jiabiao, Shu Shigeng, Jin Jiasheng</p>
<p>Bao Shantong, Sun Huizhang, Jia Jiliang, Tang Yingheng, Jiang Fuxiang</p>

<p>Middle School Principals Visit He Yuanfan to Request Payment: Satisfactory Result, One Month's Funding to Be Released First</p>
<p>Various education institutions in Zhejiang Province, due to owing three months of education fees, have not received a single penny since the beginning of this semester, resulting in extreme difficulties. Yesterday, the principals of Hangzhou High School Xiang Baorong, Medical College President Wang Ji, Hangzhou Normal School President Xu Xudong, High Sericulture School President Chen Shimin, and the principals of Hangzhou Women's High School, Shaoxing High School, and other education institution representatives, more than ten people in total, were received by Director of Finance Cheng Yuanfan. First, the principals explained the difficult situation and requested two points: (1) To pay off the expenses for July and August before the end of this month and then allocate the overdue funds monthly so that the schools can barely maintain their facilities and their work will not be interrupted. (2) Please ensure that education-specific funds are protected as before, and if the amount is insufficient, please find ways to make up for it. Mr. Cheng expressed that he has always paid great attention to the maintenance of education and that even if the province's finances are extremely difficult, he always tries his best to find ways. He also promised to raise and allocate August's funds first. The result was quite satisfactory.</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Dr. Chiang Ting-fu, the newly appointed ambassador to the Soviet Union, along with his wife and the newly appointed Second Secretary of the Embassy, Yuan Daofeng, and his wife, left Nanjing by the 11 PM express train the night before last and arrived at the North Railway Station in Shanghai at around 7 AM yesterday morning. They proceeded to the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road to rest in a reserved room and will depart tomorrow morning on the Soviet Russian Aid Association's Northern Star ship to take up their post in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Departing Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>The ship is docked at the Yitaixing Wharf in Pudong and is scheduled to set sail at 8 AM tomorrow morning. Ambassador Chiang is scheduled to cross the Huangpu River from the Xinguang Wharf and board the ship at 6:30 AM. Accompanying him, in addition to his wife and two sons, Huai-ren and Ju-ren, and Secretary Yuan Daofeng and his wife, are also the newly appointed First Secretary Shi Zhaoying, Second Secretary Geng Kuang, Third Secretary Gou Zengqi, Attendant Li Nenggeng and his wife, Ximen Zonghua, Principal Shi Qinan, and over ten others. Secretary Shi and the others arrived in Shanghai a few days ago.</p>
<p>Farewell Visits Today</p>
<p>Ambassador Chiang is scheduled to visit Soviet Ambassador to China Bogomolov, Mayor of Shanghai Wu Tiecheng, and others today. His wife will visit Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, and Foreign Minister Zhang's wife to bid them farewell. Ambassador Chiang has a busy schedule of social engagements for the past two days. At noon today, there are banquets hosted by the International Hotel and the Shanghai YMCA. At 5 PM, the newly appointed Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Wang Zhengting, will hold a tea party at the International Hotel. At the same time, the Tsinghua Alumni Association will hold a tea party at its clubhouse on Jing'an Temple Road. In the evening, there will be a banquet hosted by Mr. and Mrs. Liu Wang Liming, and Mr. and Mrs. Wang Zijii.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Farewell Gathering</p>
<p>Eleven organizations in Shanghai, including the International Problems Research Association, the Bank Association, the Money Trade Association, the Shanghai YMCA, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Local Autonomy Association, the World Chinese Students' Federation, the Taxpaying Chinese Association, the Shanghai Catholic Action Society, the Pacific International Studies Association, and the Shanghai Universities Joint Association, held a grand tea party at the Bank Club on Hong Kong Road at 5 PM yesterday to bid farewell to Ambassador Chiang. Over sixty representatives from these groups were present, including Li Zhaohuan, Jin Runxiang, Du Yuesheng (representing Jin Runxiang), Huang Renzhi, Xu Xinliu, Liu Hongsheng, Lin Kanghou, Guo Bingwen, Shen Yi, He Bingsong, Zou Bingwen, Cheng Haifeng, Pan Yangyao, Zhu Shaoping, Tang Liangli, Sun Mengzhou, Lu Ganchen, Liu Yunfang, Zhu Xinong, Zai Manyun, Cao Huiqun, and Zhu Gengtao. Ambassador Chiang and Secretary Geng Kuang arrived on time.</p>
<p>Ambassador Chiang's Speech</p>
<p>After taking their seats, Chairman Li Zhaohuan delivered a farewell speech. Ambassador Chiang then stood up and gave a reply, expressing his gratitude for the warm send-off from the various organizations. He then delivered a speech stating that the future of China's national fortune lies in using our own domestic resources and manpower to seek opportunities for peaceful development. With peaceful development, national difficulties can be eliminated. The efforts of diplomacy lie precisely in this. Seeking peaceful solutions boils down to two approaches: one is the new approach, which is collective security. This has two methods: (1) maintaining peace through the League of Nations, and (2) peace-loving countries uniting together. The other is the old approach, which is alliances between two or three countries, such as signing mutual defense treaties, etc. The current trend in the world dictates that our country should adopt the first approach of collective security. The old-style alliances are no longer needed. Previously, Mr. Chiang also attended a banquet hosted by the Nankai University Alumni Association at the New Asia Hotel yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Issuing a Statement</p>
<p>Ambassador Chiang met with a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency at his hotel yesterday morning and issued the following statement. He first mentioned that the Soviet government hoped that he could arrive in Moscow before the country's National Day on the 7th of next month. If he departs from Shanghai on the 24th and arrives in Vladivostok on the 29th, connecting with the train, he can arrive by the 7th of next month. Otherwise, it will be delayed by four days until the 11th. He will be carrying his credentials with him. The date of presentation will be decided after arriving in Moscow and contacting the authorities there. He then answered reporters' questions, stating that although the Sino-Japanese disputes are sometimes tense and sometimes relaxed, both sides are now seeking solutions through diplomatic means, and peace in the Far East is unlikely to be endangered as a result. At this point, the reporter raised the issue of Japan's demand for joint anti-communism in North China, which is related to the Soviet Union, and asked Ambassador Chiang for his opinion. He replied that, in his opinion, Japan's demand seems to be an old-style alliance, and in diplomacy, this type of old-style alliance is no longer suitable for the times. Ambassador Chiang finally stated that there has been no progress in the Sino-Soviet treaty negotiations.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Various Circles to Hold Presentation and Naming Ceremony Tomorrow for Planes Donated for Birthday Wishes; Aviation Committee Representative Huang Bingheng Comes to Shanghai to Participate; Trains and Buses Will Go Directly to Longhua Town <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>To commend President Chiang's virtue and loyalty to the party and the country, for over ten years, he has worked tirelessly to eliminate bandits, save the people, lay the foundation for the country, and complete unification. His great achievements are admired by the entire nation. This year marks President Chiang's fiftieth birthday. To express their respect and celebrate this occasion, the Chinese Aviation Association, through its 30th Executive Council meeting, proposed by Mayor Wu, decided to raise funds to purchase planes for birthday wishes. They immediately sent telegrams to the provincial and municipal governments, organizations, and branches across the country. Subsequently, on March 10th, Mayor Wu invited leaders from all circles to the municipal government for the first consultation to discuss the proceedings. It was resolved that Shanghai would raise 1 million yuan to purchase ten planes, which would be formed into a team named the Zhongzheng Team. The fundraising methods were divided into two types: ordinary birthday gifts and special birthday gift vouchers. The gift vouchers were divided into ten characters: Heaven, Earth, Loyalty, Justice, Peace, Happiness, Prosperity, Longevity, and Joy, ranging from 100 yuan to 10,000 yuan. Leaders from all circles, including Wang Xiaolai, Wu Tiecheng, Pan Gongzhan, Yu Zuoting, and Zhang Shouyong, were appointed as standing committee members, Yao Xijiu as secretary-general, and Li Dachao as general manager, responsible for handling the matter. The news spread throughout the country. After the start in this city, letters were sent to each solicitor to speed up fundraising. Various agencies and organizations actively donated and solicited members from all circles to join as sponsors. In addition to the committee members as ex officio sponsors, a total of 428 organizations and 436 individuals participated. Entertainment venues were also held for one day each, with the proceeds transferred to donations. Theaters, movie theaters, amusement parks, and dance halls were held successively. There were also Peking operas by Ma Lianliang and Zhang Eyun, swimming performances by Ms. Yang Xiuqiong, events at the International Sports Association, the China Jockey Club, the Central Stadium, the Canidrome, and performances by comedians Zhang Yezhi and Yi Fangshuo. The Small Ball Association and Small Football Association held competitions. The Shanghai Film Industry Plane Donation Birthday Celebration Amusement Fair was also held, and birthday cards were distributed, asking various banks to collect birthday gifts, organize wealthy donations, and local security to solicit donations from property owners in various districts. Staff were also sent to various organizations to discuss the matter, and received enthusiastic support with excellent results. The donations raised have been sent to the Chiang Public Birthday Plane Donation Memorial Committee for 330,000 yuan. The General Assembly of the Chinese Aviation Association transferred 120,000 yuan of fundraising achievements from this city, which is also a donation for the purchase of planes for birthday wishes in this city. The rest has been collected and is scheduled to be remitted today for 200,000 yuan. The remaining amount will be raised separately and will be paid off by the end of this month. It is hoped that fellow compatriots and organizations from all walks of life will donate private funds again if they have already donated, and quickly contribute if they have not yet donated, so as to complete the mission in the shortest possible time.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Grain Prices Soar; Social Affairs Bureau Requests Municipal Government to Formulate Measures for Grain Leaving the Province; Customs Clearance Only Allowed with Shipping Permit <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, grain prices have soared across the board. According to the market prices of the previous day, wheat flour was 37 yuan for the near term and 39 yuan for the far term, wheat was 6 yuan for the near term and 6.6 yuan for the far term, and rice (Jiangsu No. 1) was 11.5 yuan. The reasons are the sudden surge in sales of flour in North China and the manipulation of speculators. Since this year is a bumper year for wheat and rice, prices should not be so high. Although the government has sent cadres to monitor and grain merchants have taken the initiative to stabilize prices, the demand is greater than the supply, so it is impossible to lower prices.</p>
<p>Proposals to Stop Exports</p>
<p>The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, in view of the fact that grain is of great importance to the livelihood of ordinary people, in addition to ordering grain organizations to ban speculation and stabilize prices for wheat flour, wheat, rice, etc., has also requested the municipal government to submit it to the central government to prohibit the export of grain. Now, in addition to automatically refusing to sell to foreign merchants, grain organizations, in order to prevent foreign merchants from purchasing and exporting in the name of Chinese merchants, the Miscellaneous Grain Trade Association has drafted measures to stop the export of grain and submitted them to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for submission to the Municipal Government for approval.</p>
<p>Implementation After Municipal Government Approval</p>
<p>The measures proposed by the Miscellaneous Grain Trade Association are that when merchants purchase wheat flour, wheat, rice, etc. from grain companies, they must specify which ship and where the goods are to be shipped. The grain companies must report to the trade association, and the association will issue a shipping permit. The Social Affairs Bureau will stamp the shipping permit with an approval stamp. Customs will only allow customs clearance with the Social Affairs Bureau's approval stamp. If the shipping destination does not match the shipping permit, it may be rejected. Now it is decided to implement it after the approval of the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Rice and Grain Will Not Be Lacking</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency interviewed Mr. Gu Xinyi, a leader in the miscellaneous grain industry, yesterday morning. According to him, after the price of flour soared, the price of its raw material, wheat, also rose. Now, all flour mills are operating day and night to manufacture, and those with sufficient raw material reserves can profit. As for the rice stored in Shanghai, there are approximately 300,000 shi, which is only enough for the city's residents for one month. Fortunately, this year's rice harvest is abundant everywhere, and rice boats from various gangs arrive in Shanghai one after another, so although there is little rice stored in Shanghai, there is no need to panic about shortages.</p>

<p>After the price of yarn soared, the Ministries of Finance and Industry ordered the exchange supervisors to crack down on speculators. The cotton weaving industry held an emergency meeting and decided to increase prices by 10% based on recent selling prices. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Yarn Inventory Declines, Yarn Prices Rise</p>
<p>This year's agricultural production has been abundant in various places, and after farmers' purchasing power increased, yarn sales have become smooth, causing prices to soar to a new high of 240 yuan. The total amount of yarn stored in various yarn factories and exchange warehouses is only about 20,000 bales. Although various yarn factories are operating day and night to spin yarn, it is difficult to restore the previous market prices due to demand exceeding supply. As of yesterday, the market price of yarn (1) The closing price of the yarn market for the October contract was 235 yuan, down 2.5 yuan from the previous day. The closing price for the November contract was 229.5 yuan, down 1.8 yuan from the previous day. The closing price for the December contract was 220.02 yuan, down 2.8 yuan from the previous day. The closing price for the January contract was 216.8 yuan, down 1.1 yuan from the previous day. The closing price for the February contract was 216.3 yuan, down 2 yuan from the previous day. The March contract was 216.5 yuan, down 1.7 yuan from the previous day. (2) The flower market's October contract closed at 41.7 yuan, down 1.8 yuan from the previous day. The November contract closed at 42.65 yuan, down 1.25 yuan from the previous day. The December contract closed at 42.5 yuan, down 0.9 yuan from the previous day. The January contract closed at 42.5 yuan, down 0.75 yuan from the previous day. The February contract closed at 42.6 yuan, down 0.55 yuan from the previous day. The March contract was 42.7 yuan, down 0.5 yuan from the previous day. Although it seems to have fallen back, it is still much higher than usual.</p>
<p>Exchange Increases Margin Yesterday</p>
<p>The Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange issued Announcement No. 1955 yesterday, stating that since the market price of yarn and cotton has been fluctuating for days, starting today, for all new cotton yarn transactions in each month, in addition to the regular margin, a special margin of 8 yuan per bale will be charged to both parties (a total of 24 yuan will be charged for the current month contract, and 16 yuan will be charged for all other month contracts). For all new cotton transactions in each month, in addition to the regular margin, a special margin of 3 yuan per dan will be charged to both parties (a total of 9 yuan will be charged for the current month contract, and 6 yuan will be charged for all other month contracts). Cash payments are allowed. A new copy will be retained for inspection, and in addition to notifying the brokerage association, this is specially announced.</p>
<p>Market Announcement: Opening Auction Advanced</p>
<p>The Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange announced in the market yesterday, "It is hereby announced that the Brokerage Association has stated in a letter that there is insufficient time for market transactions. The staff committee suggested that the opening time for the morning session be advanced. The auction will start at 9:00 AM, and the opening time for the afternoon session will remain the same as before. Please implement it. After investigation by this office in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the Business Rules, it is approved to be advanced. It is hereby decided that starting from November 2nd, the opening of the auction will be advanced to 9:00 AM. In addition to the market announcement, this is specially announced."</p>
<p>Government Cracks Down on Speculative Trading</p>
<p>The Ministries of Finance and Industry have repeatedly ordered the exchange supervisors to find ways to crack down on speculative trading in flour, securities, yarn, and other transactions. Now, due to the soaring market prices of yarn and cloth in the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange, it is feared that speculators are manipulating the market, and the exchange supervisors have been ordered to supervise the situation at any time and report price changes at any time. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency visited Mr. Wen Lanting, Director of the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange, yesterday morning. According to him, the rise in yarn prices is actually due to the reduction of yarn inventory in Shanghai and demand exceeding supply. This office has not yet received orders from the Ministries of Finance and Industry and the exchange supervisor regarding the crackdown on speculation.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting of the Cotton Weaving Industry</p>
<p>Cotton weaving factories such as Zhenfeng, Zhenchang, Jinglun, Hengxing, Wuhe, Liuyi, Fuhua, Yuxing, Guohua, and Yansheng held an emergency meeting of the industry due to the current shortage of yarn and the rising price of yarn, which has reached more than 30%. In order to seek remedial measures, it was decided at the public meeting that, starting immediately, the price of goods will be increased by 10% based on recent selling prices. A count shows that thin flannel Chinese and Western style men's and women's shirts will increase by 1.2 yuan per dozen, thick flannel Chinese and Western style men's and women's shirts will increase by 1.7 yuan per dozen, fine flannel Chinese and Western style men's and women's shirts will increase by 1.65 yuan per dozen, children's shirts will increase by 0.6 yuan per dozen, thin flannel ball shirts will increase by 1.5 yuan per dozen, and thick flannel ball shirts will increase by 2 yuan to match the cost. Furthermore, it was also decided at the public meeting that all goods previously reserved by customers of various factories in the same industry should be forgiven by the customers and paid for in cash before delivery at the new price (this does not apply to cases where both parties have signed orders). All outstanding payments from previous customers must be paid off by the end of this month. Otherwise, all orders may not be delivered due to the impact of raw materials on various factories.</p>

<p>According to the Rural News Agency, Gao Xichang, patrol officer of the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau in Baoshan County, arrested a suspicious Zhu Youke (a practitioner of incantations) in Fengxian Town yesterday. He found a strange badge on his person, with the words "Gai Shang" in the middle and ears of wheat on both sides, as well as a Daoguang copper coin, a pocket-sized "Wu Qiu Yao Jian" (Handbook of Martial Prisoners' Medicine), and two papers with place names (one was a "Golden Mouse Brand" cigarette box, and the other was an ordinary note with the distances between place A and place B written on it). There were also three photos of himself and three photos of others. Upon interrogation, he stated his name was Wu Zhongzhang, 31 years old, from Qidong. He claimed the badge was found on the road, and the "Wu Qiu Yao Jian" was given to him by his friend Liu Hanchun, who worked at the Guangsheng Tang pharmacy, in 1931. The rest of his confession was evasive (while the publication date of the Wu Qiu Yao Jian was 1935). This proves that his earlier statements were inconsistent and contradictory. Patrol Officer Gao, after reviewing the confession, considered the case to be serious and immediately sent him to the First Branch. Director Liu, after further interrogation, believed that Wu Zhongzhang was indeed suspected of being a traitor, so he immediately sent him to the county government for handling.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Social Bureau Holds Second General Survey of Trade Unions <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>There are many workers in this city, and the situation of trade unions is very complex. Since the reorganization in 1931, there have been many changes. The Municipal Social Bureau conducted the first general survey of trade unions in the city in 1934. The results showed that there were 81 trade unions (including industrial and occupational) in the urban area, with a total of 62,252 members (male and female). Anyone who is slightly familiar with the situation of Shanghai laborers will know that this figure is far from the actual number. At that time, due to the aftermath of the January 28 Incident, the reorganization of trade unions was not yet complete. The figures listed above only include those that had been legally registered. More than a year has passed, and there have been many changes. Therefore, the Bureau decided to conduct a second general survey of trade unions in the city in order to understand the actual situation of trade unions in various industries in the city and to facilitate supervision and reorganization. According to Lan Simian, director of the registration section of the Third Division of the Bureau, the process of conducting the general survey of trade unions in the city is that the division will notify each trade union in advance, designate a time, and send personnel to conduct the survey. It will begin immediately and is expected to be completed within two months.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Ministry of Industry Order: Overseas Orders Must Be Delivered as Agreed; Municipal Chamber of Commerce Instructs National Goods Organizations to Pay Attention, Correct Common Problems, and Restore Foreign Trade Credit <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, national goods organizations in this city received an order from the Ministry of Industry, Commercial Affairs, No. 48804, forwarded by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. It stated that Chinese manufacturers often fail to deliver overseas orders as agreed. All national goods factories should be notified to pay attention to this in order to restore the credit of foreign trade.</p>
<p>Public Letter from the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The original letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce stated: "We hereby inform you that on the 20th of this month, we received a letter from the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, stating that we had received an order from the Ministry of Industry, Commercial Affairs, No. 48804, reporting on the progress of the National Goods Exhibition held by the Surabaya Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and requesting that manufacturers be instructed to pay attention to the quality of national goods for export, etc. We were ordered to comply. In addition to notifying the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association and the China Production and Sales Association, the two organizations that organized the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group this time, to notify the relevant manufacturers to strictly comply, we are now forwarding the order to your association for your information. We also hope that you will widely notify and call on the national goods industry to pay attention. A copy of the order from the Ministry is attached. The original text of the Surabaya Chamber of Commerce's report to the Ministry cited in the order states that Chinese manufacturers often fail to deliver overseas orders as agreed. After the orderer suffers a loss once, they dare not try again. This is indeed a common problem that should be corrected, without which it is impossible to restore the credit of foreign trade. Therefore, we are specially copying the original order and sending it to your association to forward to your member factories for close attention."</p>
<p>Original Order from the Ministry</p>
<p>According to the report submitted by the Surabaya Chinese Chamber of Commerce on September 15, regarding the report on the progress of the National Goods Exhibition and requesting that manufacturers be notified to pay attention to the quality of national goods for export in order to maintain credit, the association took advantage of the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group of the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association traveling to Nanyang and providing samples to hold a National Goods Exhibition from August 15 to 19. At the opening ceremony, local officials, such as the governor and mayor, as well as the president of the Dutch Chamber of Commerce and the general managers of major foreign firms, were invited to attend and deliver congratulatory speeches, hoping that trade between the two countries would improve day by day. The situation was very harmonious. After the opening, the number of visitors to the event every day was very enthusiastic. They were also very satisfied with the quality and price of various goods. After visiting, the Western merchants gathered to contact the representatives of various factories to negotiate orders, because their prices were not far from those of Japanese goods, and the quality was not only better than Japanese goods, but also comparable to European goods. It is a pity that our overseas Chinese merchants are restricted by the controlled import regulations. Except for a few who have import quotas, they are unable to promote sales even if they want to. Since the founding of the Republic of China, there has hardly been a day without turmoil, so the impression of most foreigners and overseas Chinese is very bad. After this exhibition, their mistaken mentality has changed, and they no longer dare to regard China as an industrially backward country. However, Chinese manufacturers have a common problem, that is, they often fail to deliver the goods ordered by overseas merchants as agreed. Most of these orderers are foreign merchants. If this is not improved, once the credit is lost, the orderer will not dare to try again after suffering a loss once. The impact on the overseas sales of national goods is not small. It is reasonable to report the progress of this National Goods Exhibition and the common problem of domestic factories delivering goods that do not match the samples to your association for inspection and verification, and to request that you immediately notify the factories to pay attention to this in order to maintain credit. This is for the public good. The report submitted by the Chamber of Commerce stated that Chinese manufacturers often deliver goods that do not match the samples for overseas orders. If this is true, it is tantamount to cutting off sales channels to foreign countries. We must find ways to improve this in order to maintain credit. In addition to the instructions, we hereby order you to inform and instruct the exporting manufacturers to comply. This order.</p>

<p>In view of the approaching birthday of President Jiang, who has worked hard and made great contributions, and the fact that all sectors will send telegrams of congratulations, which will inevitably be very crowded, the Telegraph Bureau of this city specially notified all sectors to submit telegrams in advance yesterday. The original text is as follows: "The 31st of this month is the 50th birthday of our hardworking and meritorious President Jiang. All sectors of the country, with their enthusiasm for supporting the leader, send letters and telegrams to express their sincere congratulations. In European and American countries, when there are major events that bring joy to the masses, the recipients accumulate boxes of letters and rulers of telegrams. The number of congratulatory telegrams on President Jiang's birthday will surely exceed expectations. Telegrams congratulating birthdays belong to the scope of social telegrams. The prices of domestic social telegrams are extremely low, only two cents per word, starting with twenty words per telegram, totaling forty cents. People from all walks of life can use this social telegram to congratulate President Jiang on his birthday, which can best express their respect and conform to the purpose of thrift. All sectors can send such congratulatory telegrams to the bureau for transmission from now on, so as to avoid being too crowded at the last minute and being left behind. If you are afraid that the arrival date is too early, the sender can also indicate the date on which it should be delivered. The receiving bureau will usually follow the sender's original intention for telegrams received in advance and wait until the specified date to deliver them, in order to suit the meaning of congratulating the birthday. All post offices in this city that have telegraph receiving and sending personnel will accept such congratulatory telegrams. Please pay attention."</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent letters to the guilds of sixteen industries, including the beef and mutton industry, ham industry, medicinal materials industry, silk industry, jute bag cloth industry, porcelain industry, electrical silk weaving industry, paper industry, fur industry, and tea industry, stating: "Regarding the notification from the Consul-General of our country in Hanoi, Vietnam, stating: 'Regarding the matter of notification, according to the new Sino-French-Vietnamese A table of May 16, 1930, Chinese goods such as sheep and ham, etc., are exempt from transit tax when passing through Vietnam and transported to various parts of China. However, recently, people from various provinces often do not know how to go through the tax exemption procedures, so they often pay import tax when carrying the aforementioned goods through Vietnam. The Vietnamese customs authorities also do not fully understand whether they are indeed transit goods because the new agreement has not been implemented for long. Therefore, there are often cases of mistakenly collecting import tax. After consultation with the Director of the Customs Office of Tonkin, in the future, people from various places passing through Vietnam should pack the transit tax-exempt goods specified in the new agreement separately in boxes when importing into Vietnam, regardless of the quantity. Please ask the customs of the place of import to affix a lead seal. When exporting, the customs officers will still inspect and open them. Doing so will not only reduce the trouble for those passing through Vietnam, but also avoid paying import tariffs. We hope that people from all walks of life will pay attention to this. The transit tax-exempt goods specified in the new agreement include sheep, ham, beef hide, fur goods, pig bristles, wax, musk, cattle and sheep horns, Chinese noodles, sweet potatoes, fresh fruits for the table, dried fruits for the table, coarsely made, finely made, peeled and rolled hemp, combed hemp, kenaf, marble, white stone, lead ore sand, lead ingots, lead containing antimony or not containing antimony, blocks, strips, sheets, tin blocks, ingots, sheets, pure or mixed with other metals, insecticides made from chrysanthemum plants, Chinese ink, medicines commonly used in Chinese and Vietnamese medicine, incense and incense powder, porcelain, raw silk, non-decorated machine-made paper or paperboard, and handmade paper or paperboard (excluding cigarette paper, graph paper, and articles made of paper or paperboard, printed newspapers or books), decorated paper or paperboard (excluding paper for printed newspapers or books), glazed leather, writing brushes, cinnamon, fans, pepper, cloves, husks, shelled meat, cardamom, chili peppers, tea, pure silk fabrics, pure silk scarves, pure silk crepe, pure silk nets, pure silk lace, etc.' We are now forwarding a copy of the letter for your information and hope that you will take note of it."</p>

<h3 id="e131">The Case of Japanese Sailor on Hainan Road: The Judge Will Not Conduct an On-Site Inspection Because the Police Filed a Lawsuit for Destroying Evidence. Only Need to Review Drawings and Photographs. The Case is Scheduled for Continued Hearing This Afternoon. <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>On the evening of the 23rd of last month, at around 8 pm, Japanese Petty Officer First Class Tanigawa Asamitsu and others were shot and killed near Lane 15 at the intersection of Haining Road and Wusong Road. Afterwards, the Japanese Naval Landing Force arrested Zhang Ronghe, a congee vendor from Taizhou, at the entrance of Lane 15. A Mauser pistol was found in the sand box where Zhang was standing. The police took him back and filed a public lawsuit with the First Special District Court on the charge of destroying evidence under Article 165 of the Criminal Law. Judge Zhong Qing of the First Special Court has interrogated him several times. At the court hearing on the 9th of the month, Zhang Shizhu, the lawyer for the police, requested the court to conduct an on-site inspection of the scene of the incident and to verify the bullet marks left on the wall. The court instructed to set another date for the on-site inspection. Now it is learned that Judge Zhong believes that the police's lawsuit against Zhang is only for the crime of destroying evidence, not for murder. Therefore, it is only necessary to investigate the points of destroying evidence. As for the situation at the scene of the murder, the police have not only drawn detailed drawings but also taken many photos, which can be understood by reviewing them in detail. There is no need to conduct another on-site inspection. Therefore, it was decided not to conduct the on-site inspection. It is not true that Judge Zhong was scheduled to conduct an on-site inspection of the scene of the incident yesterday afternoon. The case is scheduled for a continued hearing at 2 pm this afternoon. Judge Zhong will conduct a public hearing in the First Criminal Division of the First Special Court.</p>

<p>According to Nongcun She, the town of Minhang in southern Shanghai is a prosperous commercial center. Farmers from Punan cross the river daily from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. to sell their produce or purchase goods. In addition to the ferry operated by the Jiangsu Construction Department, local residents own wooden ferries to transport passengers. Yesterday, a ferryman named Lu Agu, who lived near the west ferry crossing, carried over 40 passengers from Punan to Minhang at about 11 a.m. Agu, who had an opium addiction, mistakenly raised the sail because he was eager to reach Minhang to satisfy his craving. When the boat reached the center of the Huangpu River, it suddenly capsized, and all the passengers fell into the river. The public security police nearby saw this and immediately sounded the alarm. Patrol boats from the Minhang-based Water Police rushed to the scene to rescue the victims. Four villagers were rescued near the power plant, and 13 were rescued in front of the orphanage. All were in critical condition and were treated by local doctors. The remaining 20-plus people drowned. By 5 p.m. yesterday, seven bodies had been recovered, two of whom were reportedly father and son, embracing each other. The sound of wailing echoed on both sides of the Huangpu River, moving all who heard it. The ferryman Lu Agu, who was a strong swimmer, swam to the north bank of the Huangpu River and surrendered himself to the First District Office of the Jiangsu Water Police for punishment. He has been taken into custody by the office.</p>
<h3 id="e141">After a Year and a Half and Five Judges, Zhou Zhiliang is Sentenced: Only Convicted of Robbery, Sentenced to Six Years; Acquitted of All Other Charges of Theft, Murder, and Kidnapping <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Zhiliang from Nantong, also known as Zhou Changshou and Zhou Ziliang, aged 36, residing at No. 8, Badaitou, Yangshu Pei, was formerly a detective's assistant. In February of the 24th year of the Republic [1935], he was arrested by the First Team of the First District of the Water Police, along with his fellow villagers Zhang Weilin and Wu Yunbao. They were handed over to the District Court, where Prosecutor Ouyang Shu investigated the facts of the crime. It was revealed that on the night of June 12th in the 17th year of the Republic [1928], Zhiliang, along with Xue Xi'en and about 30 others, carrying guns and knives, broke into the house of Zhang Zhanqing in the Beisiwu Jia area of Yudong Liujia Town in Xin Nantong County, looting property,</p>
<p>Killing the Master</p>
<p>Zhang Tianfu, Zhang Guangshun, and Zhang Yangshi were killed, and Zhang Zhanqing, Ge Zhanlin, Li Fu, and Li Lianchuan were injured. They also robbed clothes, silver, jewelry, and other items. Before fleeing, they set fire to firewood and threw the bodies into the flames, then fled. Zhang Zhanqing reported the incident to the Nantong County Government, which verified the facts. It was determined that the deceased Zhang Yangshi (i.e., Zhang Zhanqing's mother) had a knife wound on her vagina, one and a half inches in diameter, penetrating deep into the inner left and right thighs, and gunshot wounds in various places. The deceased Zhang Guangshun had gunshot wounds on his left and right legs, breaking the bones. The deceased Zhang Tianfu had</p>
<p>a gunshot wound</p>
<p>below the throat, exiting through the left shoulder of the merged face, and a gunshot wound on the right ribs, exiting through the merged face. The wounds were all charred black with bloodstains. Both heels were connected, and the soles of both feet had burn marks, the skin and flesh dry and black, indicating they were burned after death. Zhang [illegible] had a gunshot graze wound on the left back ribs, the skin broken with scabs. Li Fu had a wooden weapon wound on the right forehead, red and slightly swollen. Li Lianchuan had wooden weapon wounds on both foreheads, both purplish-red and slightly swollen. The right ribs had a fist wound,</p>
<p>red and slightly swollen.</p>
<p>The left leg had a small knife wound. Ge Zhanlin had a gunshot wound on the left leg, the skin broken with blood, the bullet exiting through the face. Autopsy reports and injury reports were filled out and attached to the case, and the fugitive thieves were wanted. Zhou Zhiliang fled to Shanghai. In an unspecified date in the eleventh month of the lunar calendar last year, he and Zhang Weilin and Wu Xiyu (i.e., Wu Yunbao) kidnapped an unknown person for ransom. Again, at [illegible] a.m. on the 30th of the twelfth month of the same year, at the end of the present Gecheng Road, they together robbed the owner of the Lide Oil Factory in Xiaoshadu, Liu Shunde, for ransom, and then secretly plotted to kidnap a Mr. Wu on Baker Road, but were</p>
<p>discovered by Lu</p>
<p>Guiqing, who secretly ordered Gao Geli and Chen Bojun to report to the First Team of the Jiangsu Water Police, who arrested Zhou Zhiliang, Zhang Weilin, Wu Yunbao, and related persons Zhang Haotao and Li Hehou. Zhang Haotao and Li He [illegible] were released without involvement. Zhou Zhiliang was suspected of jointly committing robbery and intentional homicide, and injuring more than [illegible] people, which constitutes a crime under Article 1, Section 12 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits. He also jointly kidnapped people for ransom with Zhang Weilin and Wu Yunbao, all committing crimes under Article 1, Section 1 of the aforementioned regulations. The provisions of Article 9 and Article 40 of the Criminal Code should be applied for sentencing. Zhou Zhiliang</p>
<p>had multiple crimes occurring together.</p>
<p>According to the aforementioned Article 9 and Article 69 and Article 70, Section 1 of the same law, they should be combined and punished, and a public prosecution should be initiated with a request for severe punishment with the death penalty. This case was filed on February 28th of the 24th year [1935], and Lawyer Yan Longwenhuan vigorously defended the accused. Therefore, after the first interrogation by Judge Shao Qinzhi, Judge Tan Zhuohong, who was in Suzhou facing official lawsuits, was transferred to interrogate. After Tan committed a crime, Judge Lu Hongyi was transferred to interrogate, and then Judge Zhao Yongzhou was transferred to interrogate. After passing through</p>
<p>five judges,</p>
<p>the case was not concluded, extending to a year and a half. As a result, Judge Xie Zhengmu re-examined the case yesterday. Judge Xie pronounced the verdict, sentencing Zhou Zhiliang to six years of imprisonment for the crime of robbery, and acquitting Zhang Weilin and Wu Yunbao of all other charges of banditry, murder, injury, and kidnapping.</p>

<p>Accountants Li Ding and Xu Yongzuo, and Lawyer Qian Shusheng, recently, in the name of the bankruptcy administrator of the Chinese Industrial Bank, filed a complaint against the bank's former and current managers Qin Baoyuan, Lu Mengxiang, Wu Songlu, Zhou Shaopeng, Wang Zhuoying, etc., for embezzlement, and also listed Lu Xihou, a managing director of the bank, as the plaintiff. When the First Special District Court summoned them for questioning, Lu specially appeared in court and stated that he had not agreed to the lawsuit filed by Xu et al. before the lawsuit was filed, and none of the defendants appeared in response to the summons. It was ordered to await further summons. The previous reports have repeatedly recorded these situations. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Chuan Lin continued the hearing, but the defendants still did not appear. Judge Chuan then stated that whether the bankruptcy of this case can be approved has not yet been determined. Since it is currently at a standstill, the title of bankruptcy administrator seems inappropriate for this case. If a lawsuit is to be filed, it should be done in the name of a liquidator, etc. Lu also stated in court that if he is to be listed as a plaintiff, the name should be corrected. The court then ordered a two-week postponement for further hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Tongyi Trust Company Case: Xu Jiqing and Others Appeal; Dissatisfied with the First Instance Judgment; Arguments Concluded Yesterday <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Beijing Road Tongyi Trust Company suddenly went bankrupt on June 16th of this year. After declaring bankruptcy, it was accused of privately mortgaging public bonds entrusted to it by general clients to various banks. The entrusting custodians, Yang Zhongji, Jin Yefeng, Qin Yinshin, Jin Jiyun, Chen Danding, Lu Tangji, Huang Qiweng, Wu Zhongheng, Wu [illegible] Peng, Yao Xiangtang, Li Songtao, etc., retained lawyers Le Junwei, Zhang Yifan, etc., to file criminal lawsuits with the First Special Court against the company's general manager Huang Suichu,</p>
<p>managing directors</p>
<p>Liu Fangyuan, Xiong Mulian, director and manager Sun Xinzhang, directors Hua Rensan, Wu Jingwen, Chen Gongqia, Xu Jiqing, Zhou Shouliang, Guo Yushang, assistant managers Jin Weiqin, Zhou Longzhan, Deng Dongming, and supervisors Jiang Yizhi, Chuan Zhuyin, warehouse manager Liu Zikang, etc., for embezzlement, fraud, breach of trust, and violations of Articles 232 and 233 of the Company Law, etc., and attached civil lawsuits.</p>
<p>The first instance judgment</p>
<p>sentenced Liu Qiankang, Zhou Longzhan, and Deng Dongming to one year and six months of imprisonment each. Xu Ji [illegible], Zhou Shouliang, and Guo Yushang were each fined 1,000 yuan. Jiang Yizhi and Fu Zhuyin were each fined 800 yuan. The trial for the remaining people was temporarily suspended due to unknown addresses. The attached civil lawsuits were transferred to the civil court. All details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Liu Zikang, Xu Jiqing, and the other nine people who were sentenced to imprisonment and fines were dissatisfied with the first instance judgment and retained lawyers Xu Shihao and others to</p>
<p>file an appeal</p>
<p>with the High [illegible] Branch. The plaintiffs were only Yang Zhongji, Jin Yefeng, and Qin Yinshin, who retained lawyer Le Junwei and also filed an appeal. Yesterday afternoon, Court President Yu Hua and Judges Nie and Xiao held a joint hearing. First, lawyer Le Junwei, representing the plaintiffs, stated that the sentences of the defendants in the first instance were too lenient and requested severe punishment. However, Deng Dongming's portion waived the appeal. Then, defendant appellant Deng Dongming testified that he was the deputy manager and director of the insurance department of Tongyi Company. He stated that the company</p>
<p>had a total of four departments,</p>
<p>divided into trust, savings, banking, and insurance, and there were four deputy managers. He, as the deputy manager, was solely responsible for the insurance department. The insurance department was established in the 17th year of the Republic [1928] with a capital of 30,000 yuan, deposited in Tongyi Company. However, it was independent in nature and not mixed with the banking and other departments of Tongyi Company. The affairs were separate, so he did not advise on the banking department, etc. Jin Weiqin and Zhou Longzhan testified that they were assistant managers of Tongyi, who were</p>
<p>employees by nature.</p>
<p>They usually only listened to the orders of the general and deputy managers and had no authority to handle company affairs at all. The original trial did not recognize their positions clearly, so they appealed. Liu Zikang testified that he was the director of the custodial department and also an employee, unable to bear criminal responsibility. Moreover, four people were sentenced in the original trial at the same time, but now he is the only one being detained, which is unfair. He requested permission to be released on bail. Xu Jiqing testified that he was an ordinary director of Tongyi and</p>
<p>never advised</p>
<p>on company affairs, so he could not accept the fine imposed by the original trial. The reasons for the appeals of Zhou Shouliang, Guo Yushang, and Fu Zhuyin were the same as Xu's. Jiang Yizhi was unable to attend the hearing due to illness. His defense lawyer, in [illegible] Chen, stated the reasons for the appeal. The court then ordered the start of the debate and announced the conclusion of the debate in this case, with a date set for sentencing.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Fu Yi Exchanges Scorched Banknotes: Police File Public Prosecution; Citing Article 199 <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Fu Yi, a Cantonese, recently took eighteen Transportation Bank banknotes, each worth one yuan, with the middle picture and bank name damaged and scorched, to the bank to exchange for new banknotes. The bank, due to the recent discovery in the market of counterfeit Transportation Bank banknotes made by supplementing other waste banknotes, suspected that the damaged banknotes that Fu requested to exchange were suspicious and reported it to the police. Detectives Kang Zengxiang and Sun Jishan arrested Fu and went to Fu's residence, finding over 22,000 yuan worth of banknotes from the Guangdong Provincial Bank. He was handed over to the First Special District Court, which ordered him to be detained pending investigation. As previously reported, the Shanghai Municipal Council's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, filed a complaint against Fu based on Article 199 of the Criminal Code, which states, "Intending to provide for the counterfeiting or alteration of common currency, banknotes, or bank notes, or intending to provide for the reduction of the weight of common currency, manufacturing, delivering, or receiving various machinery and raw materials," Last morning, Judge Feng Shide ordered Fu to be brought to trial. According to Lawyer Ru, the defendant only admitted to purchasing the banknotes gradually and denied other actions, so the police still need to continue the investigation to clarify the truth. Judge Feng immediately questioned Fu Yi, who stated that the damaged one-yuan Transportation Bank banknotes were purchased at half price in his hometown of Guangdong. As for the Guangdong Provincial Bank banknotes, they were purchased in Shanghai. The banknotes are currently suspended from exchange, but his purpose in purchasing them was only to hope to make a profit when they are redeemed in the future and had no other purpose. Judge Feng, considering that the case still needs investigation, ordered Fu Yi to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing for seven days.</p>

He Meisheng immediately shouted for help. The Indians took out a pistol and fired two shots at him. One bullet hit He Meisheng's left cheek and exited behind his ear. Another bullet hit his jaw but did not exit. Later, the citizen training squad of the area heard the gunshots and rushed to investigate, finding He Meisheng lying on the ground, unconscious.

<p>Zhou Fushi, from Pudong, 22 years old, residing at the Zhou family residence in Chunsiqu Qiaodong Village, Pudong, worked as a clerk in a rice shop on Fangbang Road. On June 22nd of the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], he betrothed Hu Zhuying (19 years old), the daughter of Hu Aqian from Shixianmiao Township, Quhu, through matchmaker Zhou Jingui. He gave 170 yuan in betrothal gifts and gold rings and bracelets worth 48 yuan. The wedding was scheduled for January 15th of the 25th year [1936]. Unexpectedly, on the day of the auspicious occasion, when the bridal sedan arrived, the bride had already eloped the day before, causing great disappointment for both families. Later, in March, Hu Aqian found his daughter at the Shanghai Military Camp in the South City and arrested her lover, Tang Liangen. At the same time, it was learned that his daughter was pregnant. Hu Aqian then sued in the District Court and had Tang punished. The daughter was taken back home to await remarriage. However, Zhou Fushi, because his fiancée had committed adultery with another man and was pregnant, felt that marrying such a bride would be a complete loss of face. He retained lawyer Ye Yi to sue in the District Court, requesting the termination of the marriage contract and the return of the betrothal gifts, jewelry, and miscellaneous expenses for the engagement banquet, totaling 279 yuan. Yesterday, Judge Chen Bingxin opened the court for hearing. Hu Zhuying did not appear and was represented by her father, Hu Aqian. First, Zhou Fushi explained the situation. The judge then said that if the defendant returned the betrothal gifts and jewelry and the losses were waived, the case could be settled amicably. Zhou agreed. The judge then asked Hu Aqian if his daughter was pregnant with another man's child. He replied, "Yes, she is due to give birth around the end of the ninth or beginning of the tenth month of the lunar calendar this year." The judge said, "In that case, Zhou Fushi wants you to return the betrothal gifts of 170 yuan, a pair of gold rings, a gold bracelet, and 279 yuan for the engagement banquet expenses." He replied, "The betrothal gifts and jewelry are there, but there was only one table of wine for the banquet. How can it cost so much?" The judge said, "I have already persuaded Zhou to waive the losses, but the betrothal gifts and jewelry must be returned." Hu replied, "Otherwise, I can return them, because after my daughter ran away, Zhou called me to search for her, which cost me over 300 yuan. These betrothal gifts should compensate for my losses." The judge said, "This is your daughter. Why shouldn't you look for her?" He replied, "Then he can just come and marry my daughter now." The judge, seeing that Hu Aqian could not be reasoned with, immediately declared the conclusion of the arguments and scheduled the sentencing for the 26th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Yao Guisheng Imprisoned for Drug Case; Accused of Seizing Ancestral Property; Plaintiff is His Sister-in-Law and Nephews; Case Still Under Investigation <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Yao Guisheng, from Changzhou, was previously sentenced to four years and four months imprisonment and a fine of 4,000 yuan by the Second Special Court for manufacturing the drug "red pills." He appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, but the original verdict was upheld. He is currently appealing to the Supreme Court. Yao has been detained. In January of last year, his sister-in-law Yao Tang, nephews Yao Fukang and Fumin, and their mother filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Yao Guisheng, his wife Yao Ge, and his son Yao Dehua of seizing ancestral property. After the court opened and summoned them, they suddenly requested to withdraw the lawsuit. Then, in early summer of last year, they filed another lawsuit. Judge Zhang Chaozu heard the case and, citing the rule of "one matter not being tried twice," rejected the case in court. The plaintiffs appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. After reviewing the entire case file, the court found that Yao Fulin, one of the plaintiffs, had not been listed as withdrawing the lawsuit. Therefore, the original verdict was overturned, and the case was returned to the Second Special Court for a new trial, handled by Judge Chen Dunying. Yesterday, he subpoenaed both parties and brought Yao Guisheng to court for trial in the Second Criminal Court. Plaintiff Yao Fulin and his lawyer appeared in court and stated that after his father's death, the property was managed by his uncle Guisheng, who founded Yao Guiji and engaged in business with Longxing Company. His uncle used 140,000 yuan of his father's inheritance as capital, which has now been seized. There are rents from real estate and profits from joint business operations, as evidenced by Longxing Company's accounting books. Yao Guisheng testified that there was no ancestral property. His brother Yao Binggui, the plaintiff's father, and he were brothers. He started doing business at a young age. His brother made clothing, and he worked in a pharmacy. Binggui died in 1918, leaving only five yuan. He borrowed 50 yuan from him to buy a coffin worth over 30 yuan for burial in a public cemetery. Where did the 140,000 yuan inheritance come from? The clansmen only entrusted him with the management of 16 mu of farmland in the countryside, which he returned last year. There was no seizure, nor was there any establishment of Yao Guiji Longxing Company. Yao's wife, Ge, and son, Dehua, also stated that there was no seizure. Subsequently, Shi Liang, the defendant's lawyer, stated the circumstances of the previous case. The court considered that the case still needed investigation and ordered a further hearing at a later date. Yao Guisheng was returned to the detention center, and his wife and son were ordered to return home.</p>

<h3 id="e161">In Memory of Mr. Lu Xun <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>When I saw Mr. Lu Xun being placed in his coffin for his eternal rest, as I lingered around his spirit chamber, I felt that we should place a sharp dagger on his coffin. Because Mr. Lu Xun was not only a great writer, but also, in my opinion, a warrior for human liberation. Heinrich Heine, the greatest poet of 19th-century Germany, once wrote a poem saying, "Place a sword on my coffin; for I am a brave warrior for human liberation." I have the same feeling for Mr. Lu Xun. On his coffin, although I don't have the hallucination of Macbeth, the protagonist in Shakespeare's tragedy, that there is a dagger there, I always fantasize that there is a bloody dagger there. His collections of essays, from "Hua Gai Ji" to "Pseudo-Freedom Book," "Zhun Feng Yue Tan," and "Lace Literature," nakedly present the dark side of society before us, restoring the demon to its original form, the devil to its original form, the ghost to its original form, the monster to its original form, just like Gorky's works, making the Tsar uneasy, the landlords and nobles frightened, and the petty bourgeoisie shake their heads. In other words, his thirty years of literary life has been to mercilessly pierce, one by one, those festering wounds wrapped in red and green paper on the outside of those gentlemen, and under his microscope, their pulmonary tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy, and bloating cannot be hidden. The negative role of his literature is to eliminate the miasma of that decadent society, while the positive role is to teach the rebellious spirit of young people.</p>
<p>We have very deep traditions in the past, and we have very deep foreign oppression recently. Our great-grandparents were slaves, unconditionally accepting the philosophy of fate; our grandparents were slaves, unconditionally accepting the philosophy of fate; our fathers were still slaves, and although they began to doubt the philosophy of fate, they did not accept it unconditionally, nor did they actively resist it. Our fathers can be assumed to be in a period of transition (naturally, this transition has not ended even in the generation of our sons). In the early stages of the transition, although our fathers participated in that change and personally witnessed that change, and the social system also changed from red-tasseled hats and peacock feathers to tall crowns and formal attire, the heads were still the heads wearing red-tasseled hats and peacock feathers, and our culture was still the culture of dragging queues and cutting "liaozi." This era did not have a new change until after the May Fourth Movement. After this period of change, Mr. Lu Xun and other pioneers took a new posture to resist the legends of the past and shocked the Chinese literary world. However, the achievements of the May Fourth Movement were only in the cultural and ideological aspects, while the political aspects did not change with the advancement of cultural and ideological aspects. However, following the impact of that surging tide, the era of the "Seventeen Years" finally arrived, but this great era passed too quickly, just like the Grand Siecle after the French Revolution. What have we seen in these years, what have we heard, what have we suffered? We can all understand. Our sphere of action, our sphere of thought, is gradually narrowing, just like our territorial sphere. Under such circumstances, many pioneers "succeeded in their careers and retired," withdrawing from the banner of resistance, while Mr. Lu Xun, like Prometheus, the giant chained to the Caucasus for loving mankind, still shouted in encirclement without retreating, and even on the eve of his death, he was still wielding that bloody dagger. Such a spirit of his truly shames us lazy young people.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun is dead, but his influence on young people will forever remain among us. Although he belongs to the generation of fathers, his spirit belongs to our generation. We, like him, are unwilling to be slapped in the face and wear a smile, nor are we willing to cut off our ears because we fail to woo a woman. We must continue his spirit, wield the bloody dagger he left us, and fight for our motherland, for the injustice of the world.</p>
<p>Young generation, let us not forget the bloody dagger placed on his coffin.</p>
<h3 id="e162">A POG Enough Man <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Ouyang Shan</p>
<p>—Mourning Lu Xun I—</p>
<p>POG enough - this word is popular in the mouth of the Guangdong people, meaning bold, brave, and fearless.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun is dead. This is as if the earth suddenly stopped rotating, and the sun became lying still in the sky. We can no longer see such a huge man working and resting, angry and laughing, scolding enemies and comforting friends, just as the sun rises and falls every day, with yin and yang. It's not something that can be vented with tears. However, we can see a still sun overhanging, although motionless, but his light and heat widely covering the boundless land, the fast endless mountains, the boundless sea, and even ten thousand years later. And because his nurturing will cause the heaven and the earth to produce the glory of the thousands upon thousands of children after him.</p>
<p>The workers of the Shanghai yarn factory tell us, "Lu Xun is still there." They are quite right, and do not hesitate at all when they say it. Of course Lu Xun is still there. His low Shaoxing accent has never stopped, and will never stop.</p>
<p>The sun is still there. Dare the night and the ghosts and monsters parasitic in the night come out? I seem to hear the people of all China and the world crying aloud, and I also seem to hear whispering and even rat-like laughter in some darker corners. But if you ask them to come out, they would not dare to die. And even if they come out, they have to pretend to be something else, and cry "Ooh ooh."</p>
<p>There is only one sun. Under him everything is small. And he lights everything, his ability makes the minds of the greatest astronomers run out of calculations, and his solemnity and greatness have made the world's greatest artists admire themselves unable to imitate, they can only show a small part of him so that everyone can use their own imagination to approach his true appearance. Dimensions, Doujin and Liang are ridiculous things when it comes to him, just like we are preparing to take a wine glass to calculate the sea water.</p>
<p>People who call Lu Xun a superstar, please change that word, because the word superstar has not been used properly, people will think that he is one of the eye-catching stars in the night, and do not know that he is the largest star that always opens his eyes, the star that divides day and night for us.</p>
<p>Every word, every sentence of his, crystallized from his profound knowledge, noble personality, and strong fighting spirit, is completely the undoubted instruction of ourselves, our descendants, and even generations of successors. How much he taught and gave us is something that no one can calculate.</p>
<p>I am confident that my medical metaphor and praise for him are very clumsy. Now my grief especially makes me powerless. I have experienced the sorrow of the deaths of Gorky and Lu Xun (quickly their symptoms and causes of death are so similar) in half a year, which made me understand for the first time in my short life what real sorrow is.</p>
<p>A POG enough man - that's right, let me just use the language of the Guangdong people to talk about one of his many heroic characteristics, he is really a POG enough man.</p>
<p>Great adventures, flying, small personal duels, and confrontations on the battlefield are all behaviors that are generally recognized as being brave. I am so sure that if he were an aviator, he would be able to complete an around-the-world non-stop flight entirely on his own. No one has been able to do this yet.</p>
<p>Everyone knows how ruthlessly and fearlessly he broke through the barriers of the dark forces, but his POGness is also reflected in the fact that even when his illness did not allow him to work, he was still relentlessly and fearlessly attacking the barriers of darkness. In his most recent illness, he was still guiding the Chinese literary movement, and as soon as he got better (where did it really get better?), he wrote many essays and began translating the second part of Dead Souls.</p>
<p>We advise him to rest and do something entertaining, especially to stop writing completely for a long period of recuperation, but for him these are just nonsense. Only he knows the responsibility he bears to the Chinese people as high as the mountain!</p>
<p>To the enemy, we calmly exchange the death of our great man Lu Xun for the necessary and inevitable victory! But secretly I think that even if they are friends, anyone who has urged him to write articles while he was sick is hateful!</p>

<h3 id="e164">Mr. Lu Xun Is Not Dead <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>At two o'clock in the afternoon on the 19th, I received a phone call from a friend asking about Mr. Lu Xun's death. I was stunned for a while at the time, because I went out to a place for some private business that day, and did not go home, nor did I meet any friends in the literary world, so I really had no news. As far as I knew, Mr. Lu Xun had been gradually recovering recently, and although he sometimes had a little fever, he himself did not take it as a serious matter, so others did not take it as a serious matter either. I did not believe this sudden news of death.</p>
<p>And I suspected that it was the work of certain people. The distinction between right and wrong, the distinction between good and evil, that divide, in Mr. Lu Xun's heart, in his mouth, in his pen, is very clear, so although he is loved, he is also often cursed. This curse not only did not detract from Mr. Lu Xun's greatness, but on the contrary made his personality even more distinct. - A person who is only loved and not cursed is a strange person!</p>
<p>However, "not harming his greatness" is of course not satisfactory to those who curse him. The result is to create a few bizarre rumors and make some grandmotherly wishes.</p>
<p>I often think: Mr. Lu Xun will not die.</p>
<p>That day, until I returned home and received a notice from another friend, did I know that Mr. Lu Xun had really stopped his last breath at 5:25 in the morning. Yes, he only stopped his breath. - I can only say that, because I still believe: Mr. Lu Xun will not die!</p>
<p>I rushed to the International Funeral Home, it was already past six o'clock in the afternoon. The lights in front of the hall radiated a faint blue line. Running up to the second floor, I saw five or six sad faces, in the silence of silence, scattered with low sighs. We all knew that this was a regret, a human being of integrity quietly left this world. Mr. Hu Feng led me to a room next door, where Mr. Lu Xun was lying, with a thin face, a prominent nose, thick eyebrows, and a beard, completely like he was alive. I stood silently in front of him, I saw a picture, on which was the image of a warrior resting. What a solemn and moving picture!</p>
<p>It was the first day that the Funeral Committee decided that people from all walks of life could pay their respects to his remains.</p>
<p>I walked alone on Jiaozhou Road, thinking about this greatest loss to mankind. A fourteen or fifteen-year-old child came up from behind and touched my sleeve, asking:</p>
<p>"Excuse me, which way do I go to the International Funeral Home?"</p>
<p>I was too lazy to open my mouth, just pointed to the front, and continued to walk my own way with my head down, thinking about this greatest loss to mankind. But because the child was walking shoulder to shoulder with me, either in front or behind, I had to pay attention. - That was a black-faced, fat child, a solid figure, with a head of black hair, wearing a blue cloth gown, blue cloth shoes, and two eyes staring straight ahead. Out of curiosity, I asked him:</p>
<p>"Who are you going to the International Funeral Home to see?"</p>
<p>"To see a person."</p>
<p>I was embarrassed to open my mouth again, and continued to walk silently. As I approached the funeral home, I saw many people gathered in front of the hall from afar. The child shouted:</p>
<p>"Hey, so many people, they are all students"</p>
<p>"Are you a student too?" I asked coldly.</p>
<p>"I left school and am working as an apprentice in a store." He glanced at me and then asked, "Are you going to the funeral home too?"</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"Are you going to pay your respects to Mr. Zhou's remains?"</p>
<p>"Yes." I was still cold, "How about you?"</p>
<p>"I'm going too."</p>
<p>A strange thought suddenly popped into my head, I stopped and said to the child:</p>
<p>"Do you know Mr. Zhou?"</p>
<p>"I haven't met him."</p>
<p>"Then why do you want to see him?"</p>
<p>The child's eyebrows were raised, and his round eyes were wide open, shouting, "Why, sir! Is there any need to ask? Zhou Niu Sheng left a very good lesson for mankind, for the sake of China, for the sake of children, for the sake of justice and fairness, he fought all his life, and now, even his last flesh and blood is feeding us. All the living should pay their respects to him, this is already the last time!"</p>
<p>This was like a bucket of cold water poured over my head, but I felt the warmth in this cold water.</p>
<p>After that, in front of the spirit, in addition to middle-aged people, old people, and foreigners, I saw more and more of those batches of young students, those batches of workers' children, and those batches of store apprentices. My eyes suddenly lit up. I clearly felt: Mr. Lu Xun did not die, Mr. Lu Xun will not die!</p>

<p>— Cao Ming</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun is dead! This unfortunate event will leave a cruel record in the minds of the people that can never be erased!</p>
<p>After reading each of Mr. Lu Xun's articles, meeting him each time, and listening to each of his conversations, I deeply felt a strong, robust, and sonorous shock of fighting power. -- Undoubtedly, his life's efforts were to fight against the dark forces and all the corrupt and inferior characteristics that have harmed the Chinese nation. He established many merits for the vast masses of the Chinese people, and he never left the people. In this way, Mr. Lu Xun is truly and certainly of the people!</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Lu Xun is dead. The only legacy he left to the Chinese people is "the spirit of tireless struggle."</p>
<p>At the beginning of his illness this time, I wrote a letter of inquiry, earnestly pleading with him:</p>
<p>"...The masses are gluttonous, they ask you to rest temporarily and maintain a healthier body, for they need you to spend more energy for them in the future..."</p>
<p>At this time, I had a little bit of complaining emotion, and he obviously ignored the requests of young people like us! -- He completely forgot about himself! He didn't let himself rest for a second - this aggravation of his illness proved it to us.</p>
<p>Although he has given us a lot of spiritual food, how can the hungry masses who have been pressing their dry bellies for a long time be satisfied?</p>
<p>——Our degree of mourning will be deepened by this!</p>

<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the 20th, when I opened the Shen Bao, I saw the words "Mr. Lu Xun's Last Work" on the writer's advertisement. I was surprised and thought that the words "work" and "last" were wrongly arranged. I quickly wanted to open the local news to read it, but on the corner of the first page I saw a small advertisement saying: "Mr. Lu Xun, an important figure in the modern Chinese literary world, has passed away. Please read about Lu Xun and his works." At this time, I didn't dare to turn to the fourth page and was stunned.</p>
<p>But then, I felt a little angry: using other people's deaths to seek one's own interests, is there any reason for us to allow this mutually plundering society to exist?</p>
<p>However, Mr. Lu Xun had already understood this. The psychological description of Peijun in my novel is a good illustration.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Although I have seen Mr. Lu Xun many times, I have never asked him for advice. Because I didn't dare. I am a person with too many shortcomings. In the autumn of 1927, I was wandering in Shanghai. As soon as I heard the news that Jiangwan Lida Academy was going to invite Mr. Lu Xun to give a lecture, I took the crowded jitney car to listen to the lecture with Han Ge. This was the second time I saw Mr. Lu Xun. (The first time was when he gave a lecture at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou). The topic of Mr. Lu Xun's lecture was "Fossils of Great Men." The general idea was that a great man always encounters many setbacks and is opposed by people everywhere during his lifetime; but once he dies, he becomes universally accepted and welcomed by everyone. Buddha said "Om," and all the disciples understood something, and what they understood was different. ... Thinking about the lecture... Mr. Lu Xun's pain is not difficult to imagine. But I think that with Mr. Lu Xun's steadfast demeanor, even if he is dead now, it is impossible to turn him into a fossil. Some people blame him for wasting his strength in his later years and not using it for the construction of Chinese literature and art, which is really like a frog in a well talking about the sun, only revealing its own ignorance.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>During a certain period of the Left, the leaders at that time had so-called criticism of productivism. It was mainly aimed at the works at that time. As a result, all the writers put down their pens and ran to the streets. For a time, creation seemed to be interrupted. We writers certainly cannot forget the practice of life; but we must not ignore the educational significance of works. To shock one or two people's eardrums by shouting slogans is not as good as educating the broad masses with words. Mr. Lu Xun saw this early on. At every meeting, he advised young people to work hard with their pens. Even if they had no great subject to write about, what harm was there in writing about ordinary daily things? The main thing is how the author views things. Mr. Lu Xun's dissatisfaction today with some critics who simply emphasize national defense literature is a diagnosis for literature and art, and also for this dying nation.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>In terms of being a person, I am an extremely rogue defeatist. I hate my own cowardice more than I hate other people's inferiority. Over the years, reading Mr. Lu Xun's articles has made me realize my incurable shortcomings even more. But because of this, I have to be vigilant at all times: even if I am burned and disfigured, I still have to straighten my spine and not "transform" in this bright mirror. However, now, Mr. Lu Xun is finally dead. I have lost the bright mirror that can reflect my own image. I am frightened, I am trembling! I will not be able to support myself in the turbulent torrent! ...</p>
<p>Thanks to the editor's kindness, he asked me to write some words in memory of Mr. Lu Xun. But how can I be worthy of writing it! A defeatist is not qualified to commemorate an old soldier. -- I think so.</p>
<h3 id="e169">My Memories and Thoughts on Mr. Lu Xun <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Wei</p>
<p>Amidst the urgent voices of Chahar and Hebei, and under the tense situation of × military checkpoints on North Sichuan Road, Mr. Lu Xun, a giant star in the literary world, dropped his mission as a warrior and quietly passed away. People can no longer see the blood splashing in his heart, as a stimulus for struggling forward. The Chinese literary world has lost a general, which is truly worthy of mourning.</p>
<p>The newspaper told me last night about the fall of the giant star. Even now, my palpitating chest always feels like it is storing a bag of hot tears that cannot flow out. I cannot write good eulogies like those who can write articles. I can only write some memories and thoughts.</p>
<p>In 1926 of the Republic of China, when China suddenly surged with the revolutionary wave, my cousin sent "Nahan" from Beijing to Tokyo. It was only after reading it that I was surprised to learn that there was a talented person in China named Lu Xun. In my imagination, I thought he was a vigorous and extremely witty young man. Not long after, I returned to Guangzhou, and Mr. Yu Dafu said to me: "Lu Xun is the only beautiful young man in China."</p>
<p>Since the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, I fled from Wuhan to Shanghai with a belly full of sorrow, and lived in the Creation Society. My emotions were entirely in favor of the Creation Society. At that time, there was a pen war between the Yu Si School and the Creation Society. With my preference for the spirit of the Creation Society, I ideologically stood in the opposite camp to Mr. Lu Xun. Although I did not express anything about it. Although the boss of Beixin and Mr. Yu Dafu persuaded me to give my trial work to Benliu, I always disliked Benliu for being gray. My spirit was still in the Creation Society. Because my spirit and articles were placed in two incompatible camps, I felt extremely painful. That pain was like a woman who had a lover but married an unsatisfactory husband. Therefore, for the editor of Benliu, Mr. Lu Xun, although I knew that his talent was overflowing in the world, I did not want to look at his revered face. This was the reason why I did not initially approach Mr. Lu Xun.</p>
<p>Each issue of Benliu was sent to the door and handed to Miss Xu, and then I ran away quickly. After half a year, I heard Mr. Lu Xun say to someone: "Bai Wei is afraid that I will eat her."</p>
<p>So on a hot night in early autumn, Yang Sao led me to meet Lu Xun. I had just arrived at the foot of the stairs, hesitated, and wanted to run away again. Unexpectedly, Mr. Lu Xun called out gently at the top of the stairs: "Bai Wei, please come up, come up!" I slipped into his study, lowering my head and daring not to look directly. A palm-leaf fan fanned my white clothes, "Is it hot?" He fanned me a few times and then spread out many art books and paintings for me to look at, and amiably explained the meaning of those pictures to me. I then saw clearly that he was a solemn and amiable elder of my father's generation. A heart of respect and love suddenly surged into my heart.</p>
<p>Later, I met him many times at banquets of Benliu, in groups, and in Uchiyama Bookstore. Due to public and private affairs, I went to his house several times and talked more. He always treated me with a gentle and sincere attitude, and his words always contained a smile. Once, he and I talked a lot, and talked about everything about his beloved son Haiying, who was very similar to himself in his childhood. For example, when he was a child, he loved the mysterious beauty of kaleidoscopes the most, and Haiying also loved to play with this. He wanted to destroy it to study where the beauty was, and Haiying was exactly the same...</p>
<p>Another time, because the doctor said: "If I don't have surgery, I won't live long," I rushed to ask him, who had studied medicine, what to do. His answer was: --</p>
<p>"I think it's better for you to have surgery. Anyway, you are so sick that you will be in pain and will not live long if you don't have surgery. It's better to cut it off with one knife. If you are afraid that you won't have any feelings to write articles after the surgery, then you can sit in a cotton mill and shake yarn. Shake yarn this year, shake yarn next year, and shake yarn for the rest of your life, and be a thorough worker..."</p>
<p>Only the last time, I went to ask him to write a satirical play, and he scolded me away. Since then, for various reasons after the January 28th Incident, I could no longer meet and talk. But I missed him unusually, especially when he was sick, and when the situation was tense and the debates were fierce, I always wanted to listen to his advice or persuade him. After the beginning of this united front, and during the sensational debate, I wanted to see him thirty times, but my strange habit of being afraid of seeing giants prevented me from expressing my emotions. Therefore, when I heard the bad news, I was extremely sad. I specially changed into white clothes, wanting to kneel and cry before his remains. But the solemn mourning hall was crowded with people, and my tears could not flow out.</p>
<p>Ah, collect today's hot tears, combine this emotion with the young warriors into a beam of iron, inherit the spirit of the warrior who struggled hard with Mr. Lu Xun, and fight the enemy on the vast battlefield!</p>
<p>Without struggle, we cannot survive. I not only love Mr. Lu Xun's literary works, but also love his spirit of struggle for the literary revolution. Since the May Fourth Movement, he has been trying his best to be a cleaner, sweeping away the goblins and monsters in the literary world, and standing upright as a warrior, unyielding and unbending, he has built a glorious road in the history of the literary revolution. Especially the spirit of the old warrior that he showed since 1930 has made a group of young readers admire him.</p>
<p>We are certainly very sad about his death. At the same time, we should regard his death as a profound stimulus, put his warrior spirit into our younger and more energetic blood, be tolerant, generous, loving, and sincere, embrace the hearts of the masses together, and march towards the enemy, fighting until the world of our ideals appears. Then, Mr. Lu Xun will live with us forever.</p>

<h3 id="e170">After several days of sharp rises in yarn and cotton, cotton yarn rebounded. Recent market speculation claims a short squeeze. Long-term short positions are adding to their holdings at high prices. The backwardation is getting worse and worse. <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the afternoon after falling in the morning. The trend has eased slightly, and the volatility is not as violent as yesterday. This is because the exchange has added a special margin again to curb new trading, which should reduce trading somewhat. Secondly, after continuous soaring, most of the short positions with weaker strength have been liquidated. Therefore, the market can still be calm. However, a major player is publicizing a short squeeze in the November contract, so the market is rising higher. The long-term shorts are firmly refusing to give up and are selling every time the price rises, so the distance between the near and far contracts is getting worse and worse. The key to the future rise and fall still lies in thinking about actual sales.</p>
<p>Spot yarn plummeted in the morning</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened in the morning with the current month being flat. The November contract plummeted by two yuan, falling into the 30 yuan range. The December contract fell by 3.1 yuan, and the far month also fell by 1.78 to 2.5 yuan. The market situation was very weak for a while, saying that the transaction of spot yarn has turned clear, and the fundamentals in the next month can be relaxed greatly, and the price has reached a high level, so the selling wind is very strong. In the second session, the current month fell by 2.7 yuan, the November contract fell by another one yuan, and the December contract rose by 0.4 yuan. The rest rebounded by 0.6 to 0.7 yuan. In the third session, the current month rose by 2.6 yuan, the November contract rose by one yuan, and the far month fell by 0.5 to 0.6 yuan, because foreign merchants kept selling in the far month. At the close, the current month fell by 4.5 yuan, and the rest also fell by one to 0.8 yuan. The market trend is extremely calm, because the exchange increased the margin by another 8 yuan to avoid danger. As a result, the current month fell by 4.5 yuan compared with the closing price of the previous day, and the far month fell by 2.7 to 4 yuan. The market opened at 3:00 p.m., and the current month rebounded by 2 yuan, and the rest fell by 0.5 to 0.8 yuan. In the second session, the far month rebounded by one yuan. Until the close, the near month suddenly gained momentum and the transaction of yarn improved, and the far month was still flat. As a result, the current month rose by 5 yuan compared with the closing price in the morning, and the far month rose by one to 1.7 yuan. It is found that 1,265 bags of Hengyi, 1,600 bags of Dafu, 1,000 bags of Tongji, 7,200 bags of Shenji, 1,400 bags of Hongda, 3,550 bags of Changfeng, 2,750 bags of Run Kang, 1,450 bags of Fukang, 1,100 bags of Jinchang, 1,000 bags of Xiacheng, and 1,100 bags of Xincheng were sold. 9,450 bags of Ruida, 1,150 bags of Yuda, 2,700 bags of Dachangcheng, 4,600 bags of Dahe, 1,350 bags of Yongda, 2,250 bags of Tonghe, 1,350 bags of Tongfeng, 2,000 bags of Wang Taixing, and 1,700 bags of Hexing were bought.

<h3 id="e171">Cotton prices plummeted. The short positions in the current month are preparing to deliver goods. People's hearts are relaxed and the selling wind is rising sharply. <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market situation suddenly took a turn for the worse yesterday, because the short positions in the current month have a solution, so people's hearts are greatly relaxed, and the floating longs are exiting the market, and the market suddenly fell. The far month was dragged down and fell. It is said that Japanese merchants slightly ordered Indian cotton on the previous day. In addition, foreign cotton was flat and weak, and the market situation became more and more frustrated.</p>
<p>Near-term cotton plummeted by 1.8 yuan</p>
<p>In the spot cotton market, the short positions in the current month have prepared the goods and are ready to deliver about 110,000 dans. Therefore, the market situation has changed. The selling wind is rising sharply. The market price has plummeted by 1.55 yuan, and the far-term price has fallen by 0.45 to 1.05 yuan. After the second session, the market atmosphere is still sluggish, because foreign cotton is weak. As a result, the current month fell by 2.05 yuan compared with the closing price of the previous day, and the far-term price fell by 0.7 to 1.65 yuan. The market opened in the afternoon, and the current month was still weak, and the far month turned firm. After the session, each month rose slowly. As a result, each month rose by 0.1 to 2.4 yuan compared with the closing price in the morning.

<h3 id="e172">Yarn and cotton special margin increased again. The total rent for each bag of yarn and cotton in the current month is 294 yuan. <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the yarn and cloth market has been soaring and plummeting. Most speculators are unusually enthusiastic. The amount of money coming in and out is frequent, and the auction lasts until late at night before closing. In order to avoid danger, the exchange has decided that from today onwards, for cotton yarn trading, a special margin of 8 yuan per bag will be charged again for the current month, for a total of 24 yuan including the previous amount. The rest will be increased by 8 yuan, for a total of 16 yuan including the previous amount. Cotton will be increased by 3 yuan in the current month, for a total of 9 yuan including the previous amount. The rest will be increased by 3 yuan, for a total of 6 yuan including the previous amount. The receiving party will be charged for both existing accounts. Also, from November 2, the market will open at 9:00 a.m., half an hour earlier.</p>
<h3 id="e173">American cotton buying and selling are evenly matched <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened, with each month falling by one point or rising by two points. At the beginning of the morning, arbitrageurs and colleagues were buying, and the forces were evenly matched. Then, due to the closing of long positions and the selling of far months by foreign merchants, the market trend was weak. It is rumored that the new cotton estimate of the American Cotton Cooperative is 1,200,000 bales. Buying in the middle at a limit price showed a slight improvement. However, due to arbitrage selling and selling by Japanese merchants, it still returned to a slump. The weather forecast is mostly good in the east, and the rest are cloudy or rainy. There are clouds and rain in the central and western regions. The closing was stable. It is estimated that spot goods fell by seven points, and futures fell by four to eleven points. British spot cotton rose by four points, and futures rose by one point. Indian cotton fell at first due to the closing of long positions and selling by futures traders, and then strengthened due to good textile industry and buying by exporters and colleagues. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by 0.75 rupees, and Omra and Bai Luoxi rose by half a rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegram on the 21st)</p>

<p>Yesterday was Thursday, the date of the 3011th auction of Yuanfang Foreign Firm. Five kinds of Taisi satin yuan velvet tribute, yuan feather silk and foreign blue cloth were displayed. Bleached cloth, poplin, foreign yarn and foreign red cloth were not included because they have not arrived from foreign countries. A total of 51 brands and 99 boxes were arranged. The market situation was that the transactions of the guest gangs were sensitive, and the local streets were normal. The calling price was slightly lower than the previous period, with mutual ups and downs. The prices of Taisi satin rose by 0.2 yuan per yard for each of the seven brands of four-headed beast gold, and Xiaowufen for each of the three heroes and one color sky. The rest were flat. The price of yuan velvet tribute fell by several points per yard. The prices of yuan feather silk rose more and fell less. The most rose was the 18-character brand, which rose by 1.9 yuan, the five-star brand rose by 1.75 yuan, the only Miao brand rose by one yuan, the Huazhu brand rose by 0.65 yuan, and the Ermei Zhulin brand rose by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. The brands that fell were Youji Qingsui Jingyue Jiefu, which fell by 0.4 to 0.6 yuan, and the Jiulian Deng brand fell by 0.3 yuan. The rest were mostly flat, with ups and downs of only 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Foreign blue cloth Yueyuehong brand rose by 0.15 yuan. The three Ying Shangqingtian brands had not been listed for a long time. Colleagues competed to buy them, and it is said that the price rose by nearly 2 yuan compared with the previous price.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Many cotton cloths are sold at high prices. The cost of domestic fine twill is more expensive, creating an opportunity for the dumping of Dong goods. <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market continued to fall due to the continuous fall in spot yarn and the sharp fall in yarn and thread. The spot yarn and cotton market also opened lower. People in the cloth industry were uncertain. The spot goods were thin, and the demand was still good. The factory's attitude was also very calm, but the market price was too high and too fast. As soon as it softened slightly, the hands who made profits took the opportunity to come out. Dong goods were still being shipped out one after another because the factory's futures were lower than the spot goods (per piece) by 0.4 yuan. People's hearts were empty and timid, and the selling pressure was very different, slightly lower than the previous day (per piece) by about 0.05 yuan. The white goods and fine cloth of this factory are already scarce on the market, because they cannot resist the cheap Dong goods. Each factory has increased the weaving of Juedang fine twill and blank cloth, so the output of fine twill is very large. There are more than 50 kinds of brands on the market, and more than 10 kinds of Dong goods. At present, because the sales of fine twill are booming and the market price is rising, domestic fine twill is much more expensive than Dong goods, creating an opportunity for the dumping of Dong goods. Coarse cloth is still very scarce. Yesterday, Yihua Factory uniformly raised the price of each grade of light and heavy coarse cloth by 0.1 yuan. The market for patterned goods is stable as always, but several kinds of goods that have risen too high have slightly softened back, such as Neiwai Sizijun Piji Zhigong, which have all fallen slightly by 0.0025 yuan (per yard). Because each guest gang has successively shipped in cheap goods and is eager to distribute and sell them, they are not very interested in shipping in new goods at high prices.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Sugar Market: Chaoqing Dark Market Has Loosened <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat and soft. The association's price fixing for white coarse sand and white spot was 20.7 yuan, down 2.5 cents from the previous day. Transshipment goods remained at 6.25 yuan. East White No. 489, which had decreased by 2.5 to 5 cents per day, remained unchanged yesterday. Mian Bai Zhen Ji No. 1 from our factory was 20.5 yuan, No. 2 was 20.1 yuan, No. 2 was 19.7 yuan, No. 4 was 19.2 yuan, and No. 5 was 18.9 yuan. A batch of inferior raw sugar was sold off for 12.4 yuan per 89 bags, and another 50 bags for 13.55 yuan. Chaoqing has seen a slight loosening of 20-30 cents in the dark market recently, with not much being offered, and the market is average.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Foodstuff: Multi-Headed Speculators and Factories Sell Off, Flour Suddenly Sees a Sharp Decline, January and February Also Drop by a Dime <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw mixed trends in the morning. Prices for various months initially surged, but then declined. Wheat prices in Chicago and Canada fluctuated slightly, but market sentiment was unusually excited among outside investors. Consequently, the price for the current month opened at $4.795, a rise of five or six cents from the previous day. November and December also rose by two or three cents. However, starting in January, the market suddenly saw a sharp decline as large traders sold off, and local factories also made substantial hedging sales. As a result, the price in one session fell back by four or five cents. In subsequent sessions, market sentiment became chaotic, and prices dropped by another three or four cents. By the afternoon opening, the situation was extremely chaotic. The current month saw relative calm due to floating positions being covered, but for forward months, the multi-headed speculators sold off again, and factories took advantage of the situation to push prices down. Consequently, the market fell sharply again, with prices for January and February falling by as much as a dime. The remaining months fell by eight or nine cents. This situation reveals the intense speculation, which is a major cause of market disruption.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the wheat market opened with an initial loosening and decline. The continuous high prices were entirely due to speculative manipulation. News that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry were considering measures to curb speculation caused apprehension among investors. Consequently, the opening price fell by a dime, and selling pressure was strong, with prices for all months falling sharply. In half a day, the price pullback ranged from twelve or thirteen cents to eighteen or nineteen cents. By the afternoon opening, the market initially remained flat, but then saw a slight rebound due to floating positions being covered. Trading activity was exceptionally brisk, rarely seen in recent times. Currently, the wheat market suffers from confusing standards, and customers still want to expand their positions. Only a few hundred bags of superior quality wheat were offered at $1.97.</p>

<p>Recently, foreign sesame shipments have been scarce, with prices hovering between $12.50 and $12.60. Market activity has been limited, but short covering in the market is quite strong, and market sentiment is still lively, with prices gradually increasing. Yesterday, 100 tons were transacted at $12.90. In summary, the sudden surge in standards and the urgent short covering have allowed spot prices to rise. Raw sesame shipments are being purchased by Shaoxing merchants. The market remains firm. Mung bean inventories are low, with only 5,000 to 6,000 bags in stock. Consequently, the market saw a sudden tightening as the Yantai group made strenuous efforts to buy. Transactions included 1,000 bags of Chuzhou tea beans, 950 bags of Gaoyou green beans, over 500 bags of Yaowan tea beans, and over 240 bags of Wuyi green beans.</p>

<p>Recently, overseas silk markets have seen repeated surges, and the market is currently very strong. Yesterday, the New York near-term standard silk offer price rose another three cents, and the forward months followed with a rise of two and a half cents. Market sentiment is extremely strong, and silk trading is even more active. According to Reuters, the New York Stock Exchange traded a total of 2,590 bales yesterday, and the number of telegraphic orders to Shanghai for purchasing goods is also substantial. Yokohama silk prices are firm and stable. Yesterday, the near-term spot price rose by $2 to $9. Forward shipments are said to be more popular. Lyon silk prices rose by half a franc yesterday, and Guangdong silk rose by one franc. Shanghai silk AB grades are still sold at the original price, and market sentiment remains strong. The local silk market saw even more favorable conditions yesterday. Foreign firms were actively selling silk, and market prices varied between morning and evening. Consequently, the market situation was somewhat chaotic. In the afternoon, bids for White Factory B grade 7/8 silks exceeded $720. The bid price for French Factory 13.15 denier silk rose to $740. The bid price was generally $10 to $20 higher than the market price. Given the increasingly strong overseas silk market, the upward momentum in the local silk market should continue. Yesterday, domestic and foreign silk sales totaled 587 bales, with the average market price continuing to rise by $10 to $20.</p>

<p>According to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, raw silk exports for the first half of October were lackluster due to the current sluggish overseas silk sales. Exports to Europe totaled 688 bales, to the Americas 1,002 bales, to Asia 75 bales, and to other regions 269 bales, for a total of 2,034 bales of raw silk.

<p>With the political situation gradually easing, sales of Sichuan pickled mustard have also become more active. Merchants from the north and Guangdong have purchased several thousand pieces in recent days. Merchants also offered over a thousand pieces of Fuling pickled mustard at prices ranging from $18.50 to $18, slightly higher than before. However, the Leshan pickled mustard market remains sluggish. Initial offers were as high as $23 or $24, but there have been no subsequent offers. Market prices are $21 for the original brand, $20 to $19 for assorted brands, and $16 to $15.50 for Fuling pickled mustard. It is estimated that there are a total of 20,000 pieces in stock between Shanghai merchants and customers, and less than 10,000 pieces in the producing areas. If demand increases, it would not be surprising to see a price increase of $1 to $2.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a telegram from Hankou reported that Yicheng wood ear fungus rose from $90 to $94, and Xianglian lotus seeds rose from $34.60 to $27.40. Peach kernels, previously priced at $26 or $27, were telegraphed at $29 yesterday, all increasing by $3 to $4.

<p>Kelp: According to reports from the producing areas, the new crop is scarce everywhere. The stocks of old kelp in Shanghai are dwindling because merchants from Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi have been purchasing it as "liver tonic," and inventories are gradually being depleted. Consequently, wholesalers are selling out and gradually increasing prices. Currently, prices for old kelp root are uniformly $10.05, new ghost kelp is $10.03, cat's paw kelp is $9, second-grade kelp is $8.60, third-grade kelp is $7, and old chief kelp is $9.30 or $9.40. There are no stocks available. If imports from overseas do not increase, the market may continue to rise.</p>
<p>New kelp silk from Xiangguan has not yet arrived. Stocks of old goods in the streets are nearing depletion and are currently priced at $10.80. However, new kelp from Jun'an occasionally arrives and is priced at $10.05 to $10.06. The strands are short and coarse, and the color is withered and black, so it receives little attention.</p>
<p>Dried Snails: Arrivals are more vigorous than before. Customers from Sichuan are consuming it, and sales are quite active. As soon as goods arrive, they are quickly sold, and wholesalers have little stock. Market prices for various grades are therefore lively. Wholesalers are offering middle-sized Fushan dried snails at $88, small-sized Nagasaki dried snails at $95, machine-dried snails at $120, Andong dried snails at $95, followed by $70, Jian dried snails at $98 for large size, $92 for small size, Ning dried snails at $85, bamboo dried snails at $278, and Yantai dried snails at $60, followed by $42 for lower grade goods.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the public bond market at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange showed a trend of revolving weakening, and market sentiment was also slightly lackluster. Because the political situation still lacks clear prospects, and rumors are rampant in the market, investor sentiment is gradually weakening under the atmosphere of terror and turbulence. Short sellers continued to increase their positions, and prices fell across the board. Later, as there were no changes in the environment, prices gradually rebounded at the close. Yesterday morning, retail investors gradually sold off, with numbers 32, 14, etc., seeing stronger selling pressure, while number 11 saw buying interest. Prices generally weakened by 15 to 25 cents. However, recent Type Jia and forward Type Yi saw gains of 5 cents. The closing trend gradually turned confusing, and market sentiment was mostly stagnant, with activity being chaotic and dominated by retail investors. Except for slight gains of 5 to 25 cents for Type Ding and Bing, the rest still fell by a dime. Yesterday morning, rumors caused investor sentiment to weaken, and large traders with numbers 4, 35, 43, and 55 actively sold off, causing Type Wu to suddenly plunge by 34 cents to 55 cents. However, number 5 saw buying interest. Recent Type Wu fell by half a dollar at the close due to actual selling by number 4. However, the market rebounded by 12 cents due to strong buying by numbers 16 and 10. Overall, prices fell by 5 to 6 cents across the board. Recent Type Wu plunged by as much as 85 cents. Trading volume was moderate, totaling $10,070,000. A comparison of the highs, lows, and gains/losses is listed below (unit: yuan, trading unit: $100).</p>

<p>The silver tael market initially weakened but then stabilized yesterday. Investor sentiment also eased, leading buyers to take advantage of lower prices, resulting in a recovery of 10 cents. However, the overall market situation was stagnant. Initially, overseas silver markets saw the British market rise and the American market remain flat. Monte Carlo forward silver prices rose by 0.02 to 0.022 taels. Exchange rates opened higher but then contracted, with only slight fluctuations. London gold fell by 2 pence. The Central Bank's official exchange rate remained flat for both British and American currencies. The Customs gold unit contracted by 0.02 taels, and the official price for standard silver taels was lowered to $1,155.70. Off-market pre-market trading opened and immediately retreated to within $56. While Yida sold off, Dadecheng, Chunyuan, and Yong took advantage of lower prices to maintain stability, rising to over $6. The morning opening was low. Large traders continued to buy after the opening, and spot traders also made purchases, gradually stabilizing the market. There was very little activity during the mid-day session. The HSBC official exchange rate remained flat for both British and American currencies (American dollars were quoted but not traded), and the silver balance tax rose by 1 cent, gradually recovering. Although there was a temporary decline in the afternoon, prices quickly rose again. There were still many suppliers taking advantage of high prices, making it difficult for prices to rise further. The market shifted to sideways trading at noon. The later market initially weakened but then stabilized, but the market seemed lifeless, and trading was even thinner. Interbank transactions increased by one or two annas, reversing the trend upwards. Today's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was at $1,156.10, continuing the decrease of 80 cents from the previous closing. Tongfeng, Heng, Yuanyuan, and Mao Yong purchased, rising to $6.80. Shengyuan, Yongchun, and Yuanyong sold off, falling to $6.50 in multiple sessions. Dingkang, Fuxing, Yong, etc., made slight advances. The HSBC official exchange rate remained flat for both British and American currencies, and the silver balance tax rose by 1 cent, gradually rising to $6.90. Wanfeng, Shenda, Yongda, and Dadecheng sold, falling to $6.30. Hengyu advanced, rising to $7. Wanfeng limited sales at high prices, and Tongfeng and Heng also sold off. The noon closing was at $1,156.60.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at $1,156.70. Jingfu and Chunyuanyong sold off, retreating to $6.60. Yuanyong advanced to $6.90. Dingkang sold off, falling again to $6.60. Chunyuanyong and Yuanyong then purchased, rising to $7.10. Qianchangxiang supplied contracts at high prices, and the closing fell to $1,157. After the closing, Yuanyong was still buying and remained stable.</p>
<p>The settlement price, based on the Central Bank's official silver tael price, was lowered to $1,155.70. The closing price indicated an increase of approximately $1.10. The accounting prices for this month are $1,153, for November $1,155, and for December $1,157. The morning compensation water was $1,153, and the red gold premium remained at $6, for a total of $1,162.10. Spot market conditions were peaceful. Tianjin goods were priced with a premium of $10, while the purchase price of cooked red gold was quoted with a premium of $8, but there were no counter-offers. Shengyuanyong sold over 100 taels with a premium of $12.50. Dachangxiang paid Daheng 196 taels worth of spot contracts from November to December.</p>
<p>Trading within the exchange was extremely scarce. In summary, Chunyuanyong, Heng, Xu, Tongfeng, Ding, Fuxing, Mao Yong, etc., were on the buying side. Shengyuan, Wanfeng, Dayong, Dadecheng, Qiafeng, Shuijing, Qianchangxiang, etc., were on the selling side, advancing and then retreating, with Dachenggong retreating and then advancing.</p>
<p>In summary, the day's market conditions were stable. The morning opening was at $1,156.10, and the closing was at $1,157. The highest price was $1,157.10, and the lowest price was $1,156.10, with a fluctuation of only $1. The resulting increase was 10 cents compared to the previous closing.

<p>Scientific Equipment of French Brothel "Cleaning Rooms": Miracles Discovered by Paris' Metchnikoff's Experiments with Apes</p>
<p>The crisis of a world war is imminent, and the armed forces of all countries are shrouded in an atmosphere of tension. To prevent the decline of soldiers' energy during wartime, national medical examiners are specially assigned to conduct rigorous physical examinations on soldiers before the war. After detailed examination, it was found that 90% of them have venereal diseases, with gonorrhea being the most prevalent. Treatment of this widespread condition is indeed unusually difficult. However, Europe is, after all, the birthplace of science, and gonorrhea treatments have long exceeded the standard level. Therefore, doctors in various countries require soldiers to use the latest scientific therapies, namely, Dr. Biedert's protein-pigment compound "Clinon" as an oral medication. The results of the trial use show that most cases of acute gonorrhea are completely cured in about four or five bottles. Chronic gonorrhea, such as prostatitis, can be completely eradicated in a short period, and blood tests prove recovery.</p>
<p>According to experiments by Paris University Professor Metchnikoff, he infected apes with gonorrhea, and their scrotums swelled up. Feeding them ordinary gonorrhea drugs exacerbated the disease, but feeding them food mixed with "Clinon" usually cured them in just four or five weeks. Therefore, French brothels are vying to use this drug to supply prostitutes and old patrons, and most of them have achieved accurate results. In addition, brothels are also taking large quantities of "Clinon" to prevent the spread of gonorrhea. They used to have government-established "cleaning rooms" with a lot of scientific equipment, where both parties would use medicinal water to wash each other before engaging in prostitution to avoid mutual infection. However, since the invention of "Clinon," they, or they, have been taking "Clinon" beforehand to boost the whole body's anti-gonorrhea elements to prevent the invasion of gonorrhea. Prostitutes also insert "Caerseeda" vaginally to treat gonorrhea and leucorrhea. Now, women who have been infected with gonorrhea by their husbands and suffer from frequent leucorrhea are using both "Clinon" orally and "Caerseeda" externally at the same time, and the results are truly unexpected. Soldiers are also treating "Clinon" as their only good companion.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Germany's Marriage Circle: A Difficulty for German Youth <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>-- Dr. Chen Minbo, Graduate of the Medical Department of Tokyo Imperial University</p>
<p>Health Certificates Issued by the Government; Otherwise Rejected from the Marriage Circle</p>
<p>Under Germany's iron principle of strengthening the nation by strengthening its people, young people must undergo a rigorous examination by government-appointed medical specialists before getting married. Young people who suffer from sexual neurasthenia or have underdeveloped sexual organs like children due to masturbation during the period of sexual arousal will be denied a marriage certificate. Therefore, German youths who have this bad habit are secretly suffering. However, since Meilen invented "Bodyton," most of these young people have been able to obtain the right to marry. This is because "Bodyton" is made using hormones from strong, youthful animals. It is effective for sexual excess, especially underdeveloped sexual organs, spermatorrhea, spermatorrhea with color, and the inability to erect or maintain an erection for a long time due to masturbation in youth, as well as headaches, backaches, tinnitus, blurred vision, memory loss, impaired judgment, and insomnia caused by sexual neurasthenia. Taking "Bodyton" can cure them. This is because "Bodyton" has a strong endocrine function and strengthens the tissues of the reproductive system, completely eliminating all pathological conditions. Therefore, the sexual organs have normal development. At the same time, it also produces a large number of sperm cells, so all sexual diseases are completely cured. Restore his innate sexual vitality. So naturally it won't be rejected from the marriage circle. Since the invention of "Bodyton" in Germany, the number of marriages has increased to more than 3,560 people. This great contribution is entirely due to "Bodyton"! However, if one also suffers from spermatorrhea, one can also take "Naires spermatorrhea tablets" to suppress the essence and cure the disease sooner.</p>
<h3 id="e189">The Country with the Least Tuberculosis in the World <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>-- Deng Yuanhe, Former Professor of Nanyang Medical University, President of Shanghai Hunan People's Hospital</p>
<p>Denmark Ranks First, the Netherlands Second, and China Has the Most; Those Suffering from Lung Disease Must Consider Economical Treatment Methods</p>
<p>(Clinic) Corner of Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road (Consultation Hours) 4 PM to 6 PM</p>
<p>According to statistics from pulmonologists, the country with the least tuberculosis in the world is Denmark, with a mortality rate of only 51.5 per 100,000 people. The Netherlands has 52.5. In other countries such as England, the United States, Germany, and France, tuberculosis mortality is also decreasing daily. This is entirely due to the advancement of public health in various countries, the high level of public knowledge, the emphasis on public morality, and the absence of the bad habit of spitting everywhere. Therefore, tuberculosis cannot spread.</p>
<p>In addition, due to the progress of science, general therapies are all moving in the right direction. For example, the implementation of surgical operations, physical pneumothorax, and internal medicine drugs to contract the affected area of the lungs are all special features of 20th-century science. These are also the most reasonable therapies recognized by various famous scholars.</p>
<p>However, physical and surgical treatments must have their indications and cannot be applied to all patients. Therefore, the only thing that this vast group of patients can rely on from science is oral medication such as Tu Mei's "Pulmonal Supplement." This type of preparation is most suitable for self-treatment by patients recuperating at home and is more in line with general economic conditions. Moreover, due to its effective efficacy and the absence of side effects, it is different from general chemical drugs with rough ingredients and strong irritation. Therefore, in the eyes of Western pulmonologists, "Pulmonal Supplement" is almost regarded as the compass for treatment.</p>
<p>Patients who take "Pulmonal Supplement" when the disease is progressing can stop it, eliminate hemoptysis immediately, increase appetite, relieve cough and phlegm, reduce sputum, and increase resistance, and the tuberculosis bacillus rate is suppressed. This is also a fact proven by my clinical experiments. However, for those with excessive physical weakness, such as spermatorrhea and insomnia, "Bodyton" can be taken at the same time to strengthen the nerves. In this way, the body can easily become strong and quickly approach the healing period.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Women's Narrow-Mindedness and Menstrual Problems <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>-- Dr. Wu Zhonglin, Graduate of Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>Many people think that women are narrow-minded, intolerant of others, and are therefore jealous of others. In fact, they do not know that this is not entirely due to their nature, but mostly due to disease. Most patients are neurasthenic and easily angered by small, unsatisfactory things (commonly known as liver fire). They also experience dizziness, headache, and head heaviness, heart palpitations, backaches, undeveloped breasts, and thin buttocks like men. The root cause is nothing more than ovarian dysfunction, because the ovaries have a great influence on the development and health of the human body. Therefore, women suffering from the above symptoms also experience difficult menstruation. Their ability to conceive is also very weak, so many are childless. Other symptoms such as premature aging and leucorrhea are also common symptoms of this disease.</p>
<p>The only drug to adjust ovarian function is "Woman's Beauty Supplement." This agent is made from hormones of lively and strong female animals and can promote vigorous endocrine function, increase the function of metabolism, increase follicular growth elements, strengthen brain nerves, and promote the production of new blood. Therefore, women suffering from neurasthenia, difficult menstruation, and insufficient ability to conceive can take "Woman's Beauty Supplement" for four to five weeks to regulate menstruation, enhance fertility, and become gentle and virtuous. It can also cure all kinds of neurasthenia and insomnia. Moreover, because of the promotion of metabolism, it can fill up muscles, make the skin delicate and smooth, make the complexion rosy, and make them beautiful and moving. Therefore, "Woman's Beauty Supplement" is the only medicine for women, but those with leucorrhea can use "Caerseeda vaginal tablets" externally as suppositories to clear leucorrhea. This is a safer therapy. This is the experience I have gained in many cases after graduating from Nantong Medical University.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Gonorrheal Urethral Stricture <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>The patient, Mr. Jin Liqing, is thirty-one years old. He recalls suffering from the disease for six or seven years. Due to a lack of treatment, the posterior urethritis developed into urethral stricture. Urination became exceptionally difficult; even with exertion, only dribbles would come out. The urethral opening was tiny, causing him extreme distress. He also showed signs of uremia. He then sought treatment from me. Upon examination with a urethroscope, the urethral mucosa was found to be wrinkled, hardened, and lacking elasticity, with inflammatory swelling resembling clouds (as shown in Figure 1). I first drained the accumulated urine and administered electrical therapy, while simultaneously prescribing "Klinon" to eliminate gonorrhea bacteria, promote urination, and clear turbidity. After approximately six weeks of continuous treatment and three follow-up visits, urination became noticeably easier. The inflammatory lesions on the mucosa completely disappeared, and the urethra regained its ability to expand and contract freely, returning to a normal physiological state (see Figure 2). Furthermore, a serum test showed no gonorrheal reaction. His wife's gonorrheal leukorrhea was also treated with "Cardol Sheath Pessaries" to cleanse the discharge, while also taking "Klinon" internally to eliminate gonorrhea. After four weeks, she was fully recovered. A six or seven-year-old case of gonorrhea was cured in a single instance, which he was understandably delighted about. Mr. Jin is now a senior employee at a major company. When colleagues suffer from gonorrhea, he always recommends "Klinon," which has proven effective in eradicating the disease.</p>

<p>Nervous Weakness from Prostatitis</p>
<p>Among the most commonly seen diseases in gonorrhea, prostatitis is the most prominent. However, the symptoms of prostatitis are also extremely complex. It is quite difficult to distinguish without a well-educated and experienced physician. Prostatitis-related nervous weakness is particularly painful because this condition is not only invaded by gonorrhea bacteria but also suffers from spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, or the inability to achieve an erection. Therefore, the severity of its symptoms far exceeds any other gonorrheal complications or sequelae. Patients experience frequent urination, which becomes even more difficult after exertion. The perineum and anus have a heavy, dull pain. If a prostate exam or massage is performed, it causes great pain. In reality, the prostate is not significantly enlarged. This is entirely due to nervous sensitivity.</p>
<p>Because this condition is closely related to sexual nerves, and if prostatic fluid stops being secreted, the chances of fertility are almost nonexistent. According to our daily statistics, the majority of infertility cases caused by gonorrhea are due to nervous prostatic issues. Therefore, the treatment of this disease must recognize two steps: first, eradicate the gonococcus; second, restore reproductive ability. This is called a thorough and sophisticated treatment. There is Mr. Lu Qimei of Yierbei Road, who suffered from chronic gonorrheal prostatitis that turned into nervous weakness, spermatorrhea, weakened erectile function, and loss of pleasure after a failed treatment for gonorrhea. I immediately administered electrotherapy and X-rays, and also prescribed "Klinon" as an internal medicine so that all cells could develop anti-gonorrhea elements to surround the gonococcus and devour it. After four weeks of continuous treatment, the gonococcus was completely eradicated, and the symptoms were completely healed. However, the sexual nervous weakness, such as spermatorrhea, remained. I then instructed him to take "Butikang" internally to strengthen sexual tissue and also prescribed "Nairse Anti-Spermatorrhea Pills" to strengthen the seminal orifice. This was also cured in three weeks. After two months of recuperation, he married Ms. Feng, lived a sweet and joyful sexual life, and had a son within a year, which proves that his reproductive ability had been restored. It is said that Mr. Lu came to me for treatment after reading my "Complete Book on Venereal Diseases" (available at the Shanghai Dadong Bookstore, priced at thirty cents per copy).</p>
<h3 id="e193">The Detestable Leukorrhea <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>The most common and detestable affliction for women is leukorrhea. This condition is caused by the frequent flow of vaginal fluid (i.e., leukorrhea), leading to erosion and ulceration. Furthermore, due to attracting bacteria, it often results in uterine bleeding, vulvitis, oophoritis, menstrual irregularities, and loss of fertility. At the same time, health and beauty are also greatly affected.</p>
<p>"Cardol Sheath Pessaries" are a highly effective external suppository for women with leukorrhea. These pessaries have antibacterial, antiseptic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-secretory effects. Therefore, patients with leukorrhea experience immediate and complete cleansing, resulting in exceptional cleanliness. The lesions are also able to heal as before. However, for those whose menstrual irregularities are caused by leukorrhea, "Buti Nv Rong" can be taken. For those whose infection is transmitted by gonorrhea, "Klinon" can be taken to eliminate deep gonorrhea bacteria, which is especially a comprehensive treatment that cares for both internal and external factors.</p>

<p>— Written by Kromayer, M.D. Graduated from the Army Medical University, Dr. Song Zhongyu</p>
<p>Semen is the Source of Encouraging Muscle and Nerve Function Metabolism is Enhanced When the Whole Body is Strong and the Semen is Sufficient</p>
<p>Dr. Carpenter said, "During the youth's life, prolonging the period of restraining sexual desire is prolonging the period of physical development. If the young person has early sexual habits, then the development of the body and mind will be hindered." Originally, people in their youth often commit masturbation because they cannot restrain their sexual desires, and often become bad habits, constantly consuming semen, thus hindering development and weakening the nerves at the same time, resulting in symptoms such as insomnia and brain weakness.</p>
<p>According to the analysis of venereologists, semen contains a component that increases the metabolism of the whole body, called spermatin. This component is absorbed by the blood, and the body immediately generates the effect of energy, encouraging the function of muscles and nerves. However, people suffering from spermatorrhea, or illegal ejaculation due to the bad habit of masturbation, naturally have less spermatin in the blood, so they become weak and thin, and the nerves become more and more decadent, and there are symptoms such as sexual excitement, so nocturnal erotic dreams are colorful, and spermatorrhea is unavoidable.</p>
<p>In order to fundamentally treat spermatorrhea and correct masturbation, Dr. Nairse, a sexual neurologist, invented a special spermatorrhea pill, which is based on the principle of suppressing the vas deferens and calming the sexual nerves, and spermatin is used to make "Nairse Spermaturia Tablets". According to experiments by Dr. Demeter and doctors from German venereal disease hospitals, it has been proven that this medicine has special efficacy in treating spermatorrhea. Seminal leakage and premature ejaculation can be treated with satisfactory results. It can also replenish the body's spermatin and enhance nerve function, which is very different from other medicines specializing in strengthening the essence. However, for excessive decay, insomnia, and forgetfulness after masturbation, "Butikang" can be taken at the same time, then the effect will be even more rapid. Now this therapy has become popular in various countries.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Effective Treatment of Stomach Problems <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan</p>
<p>Stomach pain? Fullness?</p>
<p>Stomach disease is the most easily occurring disease, because if you are not careful with your diet, accidentally eat spoiled food, or chew carelessly, it is easy to cause gastritis. When inflammation occurs, there must be severe vomiting. If the treatment is appropriate, it can be completely cured. Otherwise, it will turn into chronic, and various symptoms of indigestion will occur.</p>
<p>However, the transformation of stomach diseases into chronic ones is mostly caused by taking the wrong medicine. Therefore, if the appetite is not good at the beginning, it is advisable to take the strong stomach special agent "Strong Stomach Essence" to correct the action of the gastric mucosa, so as to ensure safety.</p>
<p>It is found that "Strong Stomach Essence" is not only a symptomatic medicine for acute stomach diseases such as vomiting and food stagnation. The "Strong Stomach Essence" has the most remarkable effect for chronic stomach diseases such as noisy and bitter mouth, disgust with food, belching and acid swallowing, or constipation, diarrhea, and farting due to too much gas in the intestines, with its special and great functions.</p>
<p>Moreover, this medicine contains a large amount of vitamins A, B, and D, which is a unique top-grade product for beriberi and physical weakness and loss of appetite after illness, and its nature is especially moderate.</p>
<p>Reader's Corner</p>
<p>The following medicines are all designated by doctors who graduated from domestic and foreign medical universities. When purchasing, please make sure to identify the names of each medicine and do not blindly believe in other people's words and mistakenly purchase miscellaneous inferior medicines, so as to avoid causing danger after taking them.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Bone Pain</p>
<p>I am a simple businessman. Occasionally, due to the encouragement of a colleague, I set foot in the flower bushes, resulting in gonorrhea. Because taking medicine was ineffective, for two years, my testicles were swollen and my joints were painful. Recently, introduced by my friend Mr. Lan Xiyao, I purchased and took "Klinon". After about two bottles, the gonorrhea disappeared, and urination also felt easier. I took it with peace of mind and took six bottles in a row. My joints were comfortable, and the testicular swelling completely disappeared. Such a good effect is truly worth introducing to fellow patients (Businessman Qi Min, Hankou)</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea Hair Loss</p>
<p>Editor: I used to have a masturbation problem, but after discovering its dangers, I quit. However, the sexual nerves have been damaged. I even have spermatorrhea as many as five times a week. Now, my hair is easy to fall out, and there are often one or two drops of semen flowing out after urination. My genitals are not developing, and my physique is thin and weak. What are the special treatments? (Wu Shiyi)</p>
<p>Answer: It is advisable to take "Nairse Anti-Spermatorrhea Tablets" to treat spermatorrhea, and also take "Butikang" to supplement the body and nourish the deficiency, so that you can obtain satisfactory development.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Hula Dance <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Wuzi</p>
<p>Dancing is a pastime for fashionable people. When the music plays charming songs, holding a soft jade in your arms and smelling the fragrant air, it really feels like floating. Moreover, the servants are so humble, which makes you feel even more noble. However, nobility comes at a price, just as enjoyment also comes at a price. Thus, when gentlemen can no longer maintain this nobility, the dance floor becomes quiet.</p>
<p>The quietness of the dance floor is not because the gentlemen themselves do not need stimulation, but because the degree of stimulation is not enough. It is like a person with a smoking addiction. As time goes by, the addiction gets deeper and deeper. One or two puffs of smoke do not seem to be felt at all. Therefore, the only way is to increase the power of stimulation.</p>
<p>The hula dance is a manifestation of this kind of power. Its meaning is very clear. Gentlemen must have not only physical enjoyment but also something for their eyes to feast on. Of course, for the sake of appetite, one cannot care whether it is toxic or not. Moreover, a person who lives with poison all day long does not feel the terror of poison.</p>
<p>This is also called "being in a market of salted fish."</p>
<p>I am ashamed that I lack the opportunity to witness this kind of grand gathering, but I have seen one or two in movies and read the advertisements in the newspaper, so I can seemingly "catch a glimpse." Here, I will just copy a few sentences below: "... Each contestant performs separately, with the necessary "thrusting," "shaking," "rotating," and "welcoming" techniques. Each contestant has a different body shape, so the postures of the performances are also different... Each person secretly exerts effort. All that can be seen are fat buttocks rising and falling like tides..."</p>
<p>Isn't this enough to melt your soul? So it seems that I can hear the morality teacher crying aside. Because of the morality teacher's crying, I also thought of those solemn people who had tried their best to maintain it some time ago. The result of the maintenance was to prohibit the reappearance of the hula dance.</p>
<p>Perhaps the times are different? Or has the period of maintenance expired? But the most reliable thing is probably not to be moral. -- Morality cannot be eaten. But it is not entirely true to say not to be moral. China is a land of propriety and righteousness. How often have we seen Chinese people who are so shameless. Shame and morality are two different things. People can want shame, and at the same time they can want morality. The way to do it is like this:</p>
<p>When shame is lost, gentlemen frown and cover their eyes with their hands, saying, "Unacceptable! Unacceptable!" But at the same time, they secretly open their eyelids and peek through their fingers for a good look. At this time, the sound of "unacceptable" continues to extend. In fact, they do not have to shout first. Those who are "maintained" and smarter can probably know that their so-called "unacceptable" is a kind of smokescreen. They must be able to watch a good show under the cover of a smokescreen. When they stop shouting, they themselves are already tired of watching, and everyone else has also enjoyed it.</p>
<p>After that, it will probably be the time for vigorous "maintenance."</p>

<h3 id="e197">Autumn Night Insect Listening Notes <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Liao Chulin</p>
<p>I happened to see an advertisement in a Japanese newspaper inviting people to go to a certain place to "listen to the sound of insects." I deeply lamented the high taste of the Japanese people. In China, we only see some Mid-Autumn Festival nights where a thousand people go to a certain port to appreciate the moon. As a result, they sit on the grass, tease each other, and sing popular lower-class songs.</p>
<p>Appreciating the moon, but it must be the Mid-Autumn Festival night, it must be a thousand people, and to a scenic spot for enjoying the moon, but they just sit on the grass and sing popular low-grade songs, eat moon cakes, and tease each other. It is really vulgar.</p>
<p>Han Tuizhi said: "Insects chirp in autumn," autumn is really the world of insects. No matter where, as long as it is an autumn night, we can definitely hear the sound of insects. Even in Shanghai, people with gardens, not to mention, even middle and lower class families, as long as there is a small patio, you can hear the cricket's mournful groaning.</p>
<p>Although the sound of insects is everywhere, to listen to the sound of insects, you must choose a place. The following is my personal experience of listening to insects.</p>
<p>Although most people pay attention to August for moon viewing, the moon color in September is clearer. It was still a late autumn three or four years ago. Because of illness, I lived in a village. One night, I couldn't fall asleep, so I propped myself up and leaned on the pillow to think idly. At this time, it was already midnight, and the moonlight shone on the paper window, with countless small squares reflected in front of the bed. The wind was moving a thin bamboo, swaying and reflecting on the window, like a landscape ink bamboo painting by Wen Yuke. There were three or four crickets under the bed, calling one after another.</p>
<p>I listened quietly for half an hour, and suddenly felt annoyed. Just thinking about falling asleep, suddenly a grasshopper flew in from a broken paper window. In the moonlight, I couldn't see clearly what it was. This insect flew in, and before it had settled down, it called out "Zhi... Ah... Zhi... Ah." So I knew that what flew in was originally a "weaver girl!"</p>
<p>As soon as the weaver girl called, the sound in the house immediately changed. The mournful sound of the four crickets was rhythmically intercepted by the sharp sound of the weaver girl, and they were also intertwined. I</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>closed my eyes and listened, very happy. But humans are not easily satisfied. I suddenly thought about the sound of insects in the wilderness at this time, how complex and great it must be. So I put on my clothes and rushed out of the door, and what I broke into was a piece of moonlight like water. Then a burst of insect sounds - like a rainstorm falling around you; noisy and incessant, all kinds of music playing together. Listening, it was just a mixed piece that you couldn't distinguish how many different sounds there were.</p>
<p>A round moon hung in the sky. The vast wilderness was immersed in the silver-gray moon. The dew fell, and the plants were covered with dewdrops, making them especially crystal clear and fresh. So I walked slowly forward. I wanted to sit in a nearby pavilion. This pavilion was by a stream not far away. There were three or four old trees outside the pavilion, and wild vines that climbed straight from the trunks to the pavilion.</p>
<p>Walking to the pavilion, what first entered my ears was not the sound of insects, but the floating sound of water. This is not to say that the sound of insects suddenly stopped, nor is it that there was no sound of insects next to the pavilion. In reality, because the sound of insects had long been filled with my ears, it seemed like I couldn't hear it; but the murmuring sound of water had a "sudden vision and brightness" feel.</p>
<p>Sitting down in the pavilion, I listened carefully to the sound of insects. It turned out that this natural orchestra was led by the loud katydid, with the high-pitched weaver girl harmonizing, the loud and sonorous cricket as the cymbal, and the lonely cold frog as the ending. This orchestra seemed to have an extraordinary conductor conducting it. Therefore, sometimes the rough-voiced katydids stopped together, and only let the cricket intricately transport the sound; sometimes the weaver played a high-pitched solo, and ended with a symphony of ten thousand sounds. At this time, I could no longer praise, but just nodded endlessly.</p>
<p>The insect orchestra played song after song, and time passed slowly. Until the east turned slightly white, the orchestra slowly subsided. First, the cricket stopped, then the cold frog, and later the weaver girl. Only the katydid still occasionally made one or two short calls until the red sun rose.</p>
<p>Since that time, I have not heard that great ensemble of autumn insects for a full three years. However, I have never forgotten this autumn music. Today, when I saw the advertisement in the Japanese newspaper, I bitterly recalled it again.</p>
<p>Friends who live in the city, I hope you have the opportunity to listen to the sound of insects.</p>

<p>— Shen Jiaqian</p>
<p>That little girl was still born pretty. To tell the truth, the three of us were not incapable of doing bad things, but the situation we heard and saw was not just to pass two hours, we would have followed He Er long ago. "Thus, the parents in the world do not value giving birth to sons but value giving birth to daughters," it seems like it is deceiving people.</p>
<p>A few minutes passed, and none of us opened our mouths. In this kind of place, you can say anything you want. And if you say it a little frivolously, it shows that you are an "old hand," but there is a force holding our throats, even the most decent words, we can't remember.</p>
<p>That old woman might be eavesdropping outside the door. What she wanted to see did not come true, so she came in and acted like a ghost, saying that the girl was young, the gentlemen didn't like it, answering herself after asking herself, forcing us step by step to open our mouths.</p>
<p>So we simply told her that we would set off at dawn, to burn some food, and we would pay whatever price she asked. So the old woman happily rushed in and out, putting together four dishes and burning a pot of porridge. We invited the little girl to eat porridge with us.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before it was dawn. We gave the little girl five yuan, and the mother and daughter thanked us and sent us to the door. There was a policeman pacing back and forth there, glancing at us and talking to the old woman, also using "everything in one mouthful," perhaps splitting some commissions?

<h3 id="e199">Fishing Season <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Yunhai</p>
<p>It is the fishing season. The village is still very deserted. Only a few long masts are sparsely erected on the dock. Compared to the past, this year's fishing season is too lonely.</p>
<p>Old San, this drooping old fellow, wore an old coat bought from Sipailou in the provincial capital on this day, and came to the dock with a tilting step, watching a few people who used to be, not to mention far away, even on the upriver boats, were still close brothers and were preparing to catch this autumn fishing season again, he couldn't help feeling a burst of boredom in his heart.</p>
<p>"Can't I, Old San, catch up with others!"</p>
<p>He very angrily clasped one fist in the other palm like a banana leaf with great force and muttered grievances in his mouth. Based on experience, he, Old San, was a first-rate figure. He had been running on the water for a full twenty years. He had been rolling in the waves since he was a child. He had not experienced any big storms. Now that he was just a little older and his arm had been injured once, he was kicked out by others - wasn't that bullying people?</p>
<p>"Damn it," he widened his red eyes and cursed angrily: "Rich people are turtles, three generations are all filial sons - what have I, Old San, done wrong? They call me when they need me and kick me out when I'm used up and worn out - aren't they bullying me?"</p>
<p>The sea breeze made his eyes a little red.</p>
<p>The sea on the other side was very calm, without wind, and could not raise big waves. A few seagulls were calling and calling there, and their flying posture was very lively and free and happy. On the opposite side, the mountains stood neatly like ivory teeth, and a layer of light clouds floated on the hillside, which was very beautiful. In such a scene, he, Old San, was not a very familiar guest. Sometimes, he, a guy who was used to being irritable, very rudely complained about and cursed this murderous mysterious ocean. He hated it for not stirring up wind and waves from time to time. However, now all hatred had disintegrated, and even the life of going through life and death did not have Old San's share.</p>
<p>So, he thought that he should go to the landlord's house for a trip. Maybe, in this autumn fishing season, he, Old San, could barely earn a catch—</p>
<p>"That's right, one catch is one catch, would I eat corn mush at home for nothing?"</p>
<p>He bumped into a friend on the boat, A'cai Ge, the father of two children, who had been eating half-drunk from the city and rushed back to prepare to catch this catch, exchanging his life for the two meals of thin rice porridge for his family of four. They bumped into each other and stared at each other blankly. After a long time, a sigh of relief started the conversation and continued -</p>
<p>"A'cai Ge, you're lucky!"</p>
<p>"Third Uncle, don't say that!" He replied a little distractedly. "Isn't it the same! What's the difference between me and you, only a incense feet's worth of money, who can eat and drink his fill, won't we still be doing "catch water in a basket"? After a pause, he spat out a big mouthful of yellow water, and then continued intermittently:</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>

<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>Our lives are not in their hands. Those who are not on the boat are considered to be starving to death. If a boat goes out, won't it depend on the sea dragon king's grace, bringing our lives back to eat for ten or eight days; if it is destined for the dragon's tail, then it will fall into the water and lose our lives, and what Bodhisattva dares to guarantee it! In short – uh</p>
<p>He did not finish his long-winded speech, and then he hiccuped, his throat felt sore, and a mouthful of yellow water shot straight out of his mouth to all sides. Then, his speech became more disorganized, and even burdened Old San to support him (to be continued)</p>

<p>Good generals and wise rulers scattered and met again.</p>
<p>Supporting the endangered lord,</p>
<p>Rescuing the trapped dragon.</p>
<p>Who dared to confront him at Dangyang?</p>
<p>Cleverly seizing Guiyang, he met the governor,</p>
<p>Who offered wine in a jade cup with courteous sleeves.</p>
<p>Righteousness so clear, he refused to comply.</p>
<p>Zhou Lang employed the beauty trap again,</p>
<p>Three secret plans sealed in a brocade pouch.</p>
<p>Penetrating the dragon's pool and tiger's den,</p>
<p>The Wu lord feigned the Empress Dowager's illness,</p>
<p>Lady Sun mistakenly believed and returned east across the river.</p>
<p>Seizing the lord, he accomplished great deeds on the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>The First Lord's camp stretched for seven hundred li,</p>
<p>Lu Xun's clever plan burned it all to ashes.</p>
<p>Relying on the general to escort him to Yong'an Palace,</p>
<p>The Emperor entrusted his heir with his dying breath,</p>
<p>Grateful for the recognition and kindness, forever in his heart.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister presented his memorial before setting out on the expedition,</p>
<p>The old and strong veteran acted as the vanguard.</p>
<p>Forcefully beheading the five tiger generals of the Han family,</p>
<p>His temples slightly gray, still displaying his old majesty.</p>
<p>Few generals have remained whole and complete throughout history,</p>
<p>Whose courage could envelop their body and compare with his.</p>
<p>Even now, his heroic spirit pierces the long rainbow.</p>

<p>Yuan Chang (20) 12:45 AM to 1:30 AM</p>
<p>Opening: "Endless Regret"</p>
<p>How many years does a human life last, fleeting like morning dew?</p>
<p>Yet, it invites countless regrets to the heart.</p>
<p>Rarely are things in this world as one wishes,</p>
<p>How can a beautiful flower retain its vibrant color forever?</p>
<p>Having ten thousand coins of wealth is called extravagance,</p>
<p>The years flow by quickly as if one is immortal,</p>
<p>Yet, with no one to bring joy under the knees,</p>
<p>One can only sigh at Bo Dao's endless regret.</p>
<p>The world's affairs are fickle, human relationships shallow,</p>
<p>The fallen soul's impoverished path is bitter like a lotus.</p>
<p>Kong Wu's heroism has no place to be used,</p>
<p>Talent goes unrecognized, causing endless regret.</p>
<p>In vain, one holds ambitions of a soaring Peng bird,</p>
<p>The environment dictates a change of course.</p>
<p>Relying on others for breath is not fulfilling,</p>
<p>Difficult to realize grand aspirations, causing endless regret.</p>
<p>A naturally beautiful and charming woman,</p>
<p>With a handsome lover gazing at her reflection with affection.</p>
<p>Yet, they are not allowed to become a loving couple,</p>
<p>The river of love is full of obstacles, causing endless regret.</p>
<p>Among three thousand concubines, you can choose at will,</p>
<p>Yet, among the twelve golden hairpins, only money is loved.</p>
<p>Vows of eternal love become mere words,</p>
<p>Disappointment in the arena of love, causing endless regret.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, beautiful women have been envied by heaven,</p>
<p>Alone, a flower branch on the upper floor smiles in its sleep.</p>
<p>Before youth fades, affection is severed,</p>
<p>The fragrant quilt is half cold, causing endless regret.</p>
<p>Life is full of regrets everywhere,</p>
<p>How can Jingwei ever fill the sea of regret?</p>
<p>Making people call out in vain at the helplessness of fate.</p>

<h3 id="e205">"Happy Reunion" Premieres Tomorrow <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Yi Hua Film Company's newly released great comedy "Happy Reunion" is set to premiere at the New Light Grand Theater on the 24th. Those who have seen the preview say, "'Happy Reunion' is full of laughs, comparable to Chaplin's 'Modern Times.' It is truly an unprecedented masterpiece among domestic farcical films."</p>
<p>"Happy Reunion" captures outdoor scenes that are entirely beautiful countryside scenery. It also contains a lot of popular folk dramas, allowing you to feel the tranquility and beauty of rural life, which people in the city cannot imagine.</p>
<p>Zhou Xuan plays a village beauty in the play. Suitors come from the east and suitors come from the west. Her father thinks she is a rare commodity and implements a marriage of trade. As a result, she marries her cousin Ma Loufen, and Guan Hongda becomes jealous, organizes a mourning group. On the wedding day, they meet on a narrow road and make a big joke. Zhou Xuan runs away from the bridal sedan, and the villagers think she is a "mummy" appearing, leaving her with nowhere to go!</p>
<p>Guan Hongda falls in love with Zhou Xuan but doesn't know how to write a love letter, and gets lovesick, hugging his father and calling "Sister, I love you," which is quite a gimmick. His father is a respectable gentleman, full of benevolence and morality, but secretly sneaking around. "Truly, the old and young are amorous." He would rather see his wife kneel on the floor for punishment, yet he still does what he wants with women.</p>
<p>The widow next to the Chastity Memorial Arch, filled with spring feelings, has an affair. The hypocrite goes back and forth with her, and the scandal spreads everywhere. For the sake of snatching the bride, the son catches the father in adultery, which is truly the most absurd thing in the world! No wonder the old man says the world is turned upside down! "Happy Reunion" has so many jokes, let the audience enjoy it themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Great Light, Cathay Simultaneously Present Tonight: War Epic "Serving the Country Faithfully" <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>The long-awaited war epic "Serving the Country Faithfully" (The Road to Glory) will be presented simultaneously at the Great Light and Cathay theaters tonight at 9:15 PM. This is one of the greatest productions of the year from 20th Century Fox. The story is based on the European War, recounting the trenches defended by French Army Captain La Roche, which are a defensive line approaching the Verdun battlefield. The French and German armies often clash and charge on this ground during dark and stormy nights, with repeated gains and losses. The Germans deploy highly skilled sappers to secretly dig tunnels and bury landmines, bombing various trenches in an attempt to cause the other side to panic and the entire team to be annihilated. La Roche has a way of leading troops, strictly prohibiting panic, and maintaining a calm attitude to change defenses. He is especially able to distinguish between public justice and private feelings when his father, a grenadier, injures a sergeant. Later, he loses his love and his sight, but he still eliminates the narrow-mindedness in his heart based on his loyal patriotism, ordering his rival Denny to lead troops back to the detachment. He resolutely accepts the military order, crawling with his aged father, step by step, to the designated location. A command is issued by telephone, ordering the ambushed heavy artillery to fire, and the Allied forces are able to advance under cover. In the fierce artillery fire, La Roche and his father die for their country. The cast includes Frederick March, Warner Baxter, Lionel Barrymore, and the beautiful actress June Lang. Their skilled and transcendent acting has indeed added a lot of color to this film. As for the intensity of the land war scenes, the photography and lighting, the appropriateness, the cost of the set and smoke effects, and the overall performance effect, vividly recreate and exhibit the war elephants, warhorses, and weapons of the time on the silver screen. All credit should be given to the wisdom and ingenious techniques of the great director Howard Hawks. The picture is of the main characters in the film.</p>
