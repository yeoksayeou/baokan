<h3 id="c16">土耳其要求恢復海峽軍備 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>土耳其日前以國聯行政院理事資格正式通知國聯耍求廢棄洛桑條的之一部份恢復達達尼爾海峽與博斯波魯斯海峽之軍備此非僅爲德國廢棄羅卡諾公約之反響亦自有其內在之原因也</p>
<p>達達尼爾海峽與博斯波魯斯海峽介於黑海與愛琴海之間在軍事上頗爲重要蓋由此西進可攻擊俄國黑海之門戶而俄國亦可由此南出地中海以截斷英法意與東方交通之耍塞故自十八世紀末年以來歐洲列强在近東之角逐幾無不以此爲對象之一大戰以後土耳其受色佛爾和的之束縛曾闢該地爲國際共管區域旋土耳其革命崛起吾認和的戰爭遂又爆發英以希臘爲工具進攻土耳其爲土軍擊潰迨一九二三年七月在洛桑簽訂和的土耳共除恢復色佛爾和的中之一部份失地外更取消該兩海峽之國際共管但仍規定土耳其不得在該處設置軍備當時土耳其雖忍痛接受但其企圖取消此種規定以求不平等條的最後痕跡之消滅固無時或已個　近年來土耳其受世界各國擴張軍備之刺激外長魯舒第曾於去年四月在國聯行政院會議提出達達尼爾海峽與博斯波魯斯海峽重整軍備之要求而羅馬尼亞希臘與南斯拉夫亦允予以援助但未能通過蓋非英國所願聞也迨意阿戰爭爆發地中海風雲緊張英國向地中海沿岸各國要求海軍合作土耳其亦在其列於是彼又擬舊事重提但以當時德國已有要求在萊因非武裝區域重行設防之意深恐於此際提出易爲德國廢的之藉口乃將此案暫時擱置今德國既擅自廢的土耳其遂毅然重申前請矣</p>
<p>由上以觀土耳其此種要求其直接作用固在求不平等條的最後痕跡之消滅企圖由此奠定其巴爾幹盟主之地位但其間接作用似亦在防止反蘇聯者由地中海西岸伸足以威脅蘇聯蓋蘇土邦交敦睦而蘇聯最近在農業鑛業及工業上之建設在黑海沿岸者頗多僅藉其黑海艦隊之保護恐尙未能感到安全土耳其之要求而果能實現則無異予黑海東岸以一屏藩使反蘇聯者之海軍不能長驅束進而爲蘇聯之建設加上一層保障故此項要求能否獲得列强之允諾實一深堪注意之問題也</p>

<p>南京　立法院財政委員會委員長馬寅初、在二十七日院會對發行一千五百萬元川省善後公債案之審査報吿云、中央去牟所發川省善後建設公債、雖達七千萬元之鉅、但其中因還舊債、已用四千萬元、辦理善後建設、已用二千二百萬元、用諸勦匪軍需者、實際僅八百萬元、現因勦匪軍事亟待完成、故又發川省善後公債一千五百萬元、以七折抵押、計可得現欵一千零五十萬元、據財部估計、本年年底以前之川省勦匪軍費、此欵已足敷支用、又法制委員會委員長吳經熊對縣司法處組織案審査經過、亦報告稱、縣長兼司法、確爲一種畸形制度、久爲世人詬病、自法院組織法公布施行後、原期將此種畸形制度一舉而廓淸之、但因經費人材關係、各縣多不能普設法院、以致縣司法仍由縣長兼理、在此過程中、仍在未設法院之縣、暫設司法處、確定審判獨立原則、藉培將來設法院之初基、同人明知此種過渡辦法、並非實行法院組織法之眞精神、惟較縣長兼司法、似有進步、且僅規定施行期爲三年、在三年內、仍請司法行政兩院妥籌司法經費、健全法院之組織云、（二十七日中央社電）</p>

<p>倫敦　英外相艾登今日與德總代表里本特羅浦將軍舉行重要會議、歷四十五分鐘之久、里氏請艾登解釋其昨在下院演說中英法兩國參謀長現正在會商、關於羅卡諾條的之義務一節、聞艾登答稱、談話尚未開始、惟在十日內似將開始、里氏繼請對談話進行所將依守之機構、加以更明晰之說明、如英國仍視自己爲羅卡諾公的所拘束、則英國亦有代德國保衛邊界不可侵犯之義務、不僅法比兩國之邊界而已、衆料艾登必答以英國擔保人之義務、今僅施於法比兩國、因德國已廢止羅卡諾公的故也、艾登與里氏皆以爲希特勒答覆英法比意四國備忘錄之對案、目前應勿加以討論、二人皆料法德間之罅隙能設法彌補、故决議對該問題之談判、最佳延至法國總選舉完畢後、而於五月中旬開始（二十七日路透電）</p>

<p>倫敦　艾登外相於本日午後三時四十五分、出席下議院、就政府所行外交政策、發表重要演說、歷一小時餘始畢、會塲人滿爲患、外交團席决亦無虛席、法德比波四國大使、海軍會議美國首席代表台維斯、及其他各國公使、均來旁聽、其盛况可謂罕覩、艾登外相之言曰、「羅卡諾公的所載各項義務、意義至爲切實、吾人以該的担保國之資格、自必受其的束、英國所簽之押、凡爲外務大臣者、莫不加以信守、余今忝掌外交、寗可爽的、此層固毫無疑義者也、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　英外相艾登、今日在下院辯論外交時、發表言論、請下院全體不分黨派、成立全國一致之政策、予以共同之援助、俾維持和平、强固國聯、擁護條的尊嚴、允當始終不懈、從糾紛煩苦之現在、搆成可肅淸現有之愁雲慘霧之將來、艾登所發之警句曰、吾人自知吾人之責任、且準備進行之、但吾人心目中認爲最重要者、乃吾人必須堅决謀取植於耐久基礎上之和平、如欲吾人達此目的、則吾人須有國人各方面之援助、</p>
<p>艾登發言之初、謂渠今日之言論、並非對外、但係對於英國人民而發、渠將暢談國際事件、無所隱諱、庶以明白正確之言論、將此時局及其難題、供諸英國人民之前、國人必須分別何者爲國家情感、及何者有益或有損於國家之義務、凡爾賽和的所規定萊茵永不駐兵一節、乃法國所以放棄其萊茵與德國脫離的要求之最重要因素、</p>
<p>艾登言至此、乃追述不駐兵區域以保障法國安全之歷史、及德國未遵守自由談判條的中所載手續之經過情形、謂德國指凡爾賽和約爲城下之盟、當時德人無置喙餘地、但羅卡諾公約則從未有入指爲强迫德國而締結者、德國果欲修改羅卡諾公約、則儘可從事談判、德國所稱法俄互助條的與羅卡諾公的抵觸一節、應以該的中所載之方法解决之、如以海牙法庭爲不相宜、則法德仲裁條約、明明有法律問題亦可提交永久和解委員會之規定、英國人士之認德國有充分理由者、亦痛惡德國辦理此事、不用理論而用武力之舉動、</p>
<p>艾登旋言及英國地位、並宣讀羅卡諾公約第四條條文、謂英國非爲公斷國、但爲負有切實義務之担保國、渠願向下院說明者、渠不準備為背食前言之第一外相、同時根據羅卡諾公的第七條、英政府有以解和方法謀取和解與諒解之義務、今四國之提議、志在於談判前溝通意見、此非哀的美敦書、亦非强人接受之命令、如以國際軍隊爲難點、而德政府有其他代替建議、則英政府可凖備持向他國考慮之、但有必須了解者、德國方面苟無建設性質之貢獻、則以開始談判爲唯一目的之工作、將無可進行、</p>
<p>艾登繼言、英國對於法比安全有所貢獻、已載見於四國提議中、並說明參謀部談話之辦法等事、謂今之參謀部談話、與一九一四年以前所有者、逈然不同、蓋昔之談話、未附有政治諒解、故其意義未有限制、而今之談話、則僅以政迨協定書中業已載明之旨趣爲限、現有人倡議、英國必須避免歐洲各種糾紛者、要知法比領土安全之必須維持、他國軍隊之必不許越其疆界、此乃與英國極有關係之事也、參謀部之談話、不過適用於無端侵略之案件耳、渠希望無端侵略等舉動、爲參謀部舉行談話之條件者、永不發生、但渠確信、英國地位一經明白宣布後、此種事件允不致發生云、</p>
<p>以言英國所可加入之擔任、爲最後解决之一部份者、西歐諸國間之擔保、應爲相互性質、英國予人以擔保、亦將受人之擔保、安危相共、此種新擔保、凡洛迦諾公的簽字國咸可加入、德國亦然、</p>
<p>艾登繼言及調解失敗時德法所得之保證、謂除在洛迦諾公的義務所涉及之歐洲部份外、英國所擔保者、與國聯他國適同、至於洛迦諾公的所涉及之範圍、英國並未有新的束縛、但僅有更切實履行已有的束縛之辦法耳、白皮書所載之各項建議、渠對之毫無遺憾、今日形勢嚴重、爲戰後所罕見、英國人民了解不駐兵區域與歐洲若干地方之重大關係者、殆鮮有其人、白皮書發表後、凡可引起戰爭之步驟、卽有不致舉行之氣象、試以戰爭危險與白皮書相較、渠確信世人必承認白皮書自有其價値、世人極重視新談判、但若得新談判、必德國有所貢獻而後可、德國今尚未有何種貢獻、僅希特勒擔任不增多萊茵兵額而已、此猶未足、如德國祖任在談判時不在萊茵興築防禦工程、則或可有所補益、但以渠所聞、雖此種担任、德國且不能給予、</p>
<p>艾登末謂英政府之目的有三、　消弭戰禍、　造成可舉行新談判之狀况、　促成新談判之成功、庶可强固集體安全、而便利德國之復入國聯、並在更愉快空氣中使歐洲和平所必不可少的關於經濟與軍縮之範圍更大的談判得以舉行、上述程序之踐行機會、今何如乎、是將取决於下星期中希持勒之建議、渠信希氏已了解英政府所作之努力、渠知希氏必知歐洲期望其提議之如何殷切、就英國而言、吾人可爲希氏吿者、希氏之建議、吾人定以寬大胸襟與懇切志願待之、以期善用其建議、而成就歐洲之永遠和平、尚有一事爲成功之條件者、厥爲較寗靜的空氣國際緊要談判之時機、今甫開始、渠以爲有數點焉、凡爲英外相者、不得不認識之、英國不爲法國或德國之各種政策所拘束、英國政策爲何、則國聯盟的與其爲國聯會員國之義務是、吾人知其義務而準備踐行之、艾登最後結語如下、「余欲向法國吿曰、「爾若不準備以寬大胸襟應付爾與德國依然隔閡之難題、則吾人將不能保障和平、」余又欲向德國吿曰、「爾若不準備有所貢獻、以消釋爾所造成之歐洲焦慮、則吾人安能希望以成功之氣象參加任何談判乎、英國民衆以和平爲其唯一目的、以歐洲解决爲其唯一志願、並以擁護國聯爲其唯一政治上主張者將就他國對此合作之精神與範圍而加以評判焉、」（二十六日路透電）</p>

<p>倫敦　是日辯論由外相艾登開始之、艾登發言極長、中有渠不欲爲吾認英國簽的義務之第一外相等言、外相致詞畢、達爾頓代表工黨發言、抨擊四國建議之詳欵、謂一國不贊助純爲英法軍事同盟者、將贊助由國聯所成集體安全之堅固組織、達氏竭力反對洛迦諾協定中所載英法陸軍參謀長合籌保衛法國邊界計畫之建議、於是喬治乃發前言以應之、（二十六日路透電）</p>

<p>倫敦　下議院本日辯論外交政策、反對派自由黨議員辛克萊繼工黨議員陶爾敦之後發言、首對德國行動加以斥責、但謂「德國所爲、係在解除凡爾賽條的之桎梏、而此桎梏、則固早宜解除者」、蓋任何條的、凡屬不適時宜者、均應由國聯會加以修正也、辛克萊决對羅卡諾協定草案所載、英國兩國同派軍隊、駐紮德國萊茵河區域之計劃、加以非難、謂兩國軍隊同駐一地、或致發生衝突、又謂英國政府、誠當始終忠守國聯會盟的所載一切義務、惟對於軍事同盟、則應力求避免云云、决由國民工黨議員聶哥生發言、謂「法國無論何人、當政對於侵略性質之戰爭、决不贊同、而德國則係歐洲各國之共同危險、凡列席此間之議員、當均首肯此言也、以故吾人應卽與法國立卽締成切實之協定、俾在現行困難、獲得最後解决之前、法國如有急難、吾人得以全力予以援助、惟有應聲明者、此項援助、僅在西歐始可適用是也云云（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　下議院本日午後辯論外交政策、外相艾登詞畢之後、前外務决官陶爾敦、卽代表反對派工黨、起立發言、對於羅卡諾協定草案若干點、加以抨擊、而於草案第一部份所載、法比兩國邊界以東德國境內二十公里地帶、劃歸英意兩國軍隊駐守之一層、抨擊允烈、其言曰、「此項建議、徒托幻想、殊爲荒謬、又如草案所載、羅卡諾公的互助條欵、應由英法意比四國參謀部、互商實施辦法云云、亦屬幻想之談、蓋截至現在爲止、意相墨索里尼已在緘默之中、露鄙視之態、且因此而使一般人感覺、英國政府現方拋棄國聯會、不欲於國聯會範疇之內、共謀接近、而欲另闢蹊徑、締結英法同盟也」、陶爾敦至是宣稱、吾儕工黨議員之所擁護者、非英法同盟、而爲集體安全制度、其所主張者、爲一九二四年之日內瓦議定書、「德國若果拒不參加集體安全制度、則其他各國亦當組織和平制度、縱使德國不在其內、亦屬無妨、英國茲宜明白宣言、不許德國爲所欲爲、以攻擊波蘭捷克蘇俄或奧國、英國言論、苟能如是坦白鮮明、則歐洲卽不致發生戰禍矣云云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　自由黨領袖前首相路易喬治、本日在下議院繼國民工黨議員聶哥生之後發言、謂渠聞艾登外相之言、「爲之神往」、蓋羅卡諾協定草案、「由余觀之、殊屬危險、而艾登則爲之辯護、面面週到、詞令之工、莫此爲甚矣、余主張德國務當獲得平等之權利、余並希望英國政府、對於德國所可提出之任何建議、予以公允機會、俾得從容談判、」路易喬治决乃質問政府曰、「各關係國參謀部間所商討之互助辦法、將俟談判破裂之時、卽行付諸實施歟、抑須發生未經挑釁之侵略行爲時、始當履行歟、此其問題、與數百萬靑年之生命攸關、上述兩層、輕重懸殊、未可含混不分也、余今警吿議員諸君曰、軍事同盟制度前此業已釀成一九一四年之大戰、今後君等如加入同盟、則結果所屆、必將重蹈覆轍、各國今已在此危境之中矣、法國外交部長佛蘭亭於上星期中、在衆議院發表演說、述及此層之時、各該議員莫不極爲注意、今艾登外相乃謂各關係國參謀部所進行之談話、僅爲羅卡諾公的互助條欵之實施辦法、實則非是、此項談話、由余觀之、與往昔釀成歐戰之軍事同盟、如出一轍也云云、</p>
<p>保守黨領袖前外相張伯倫爵士、繼起發言、謂在國會中所發表之宣言、艾登外相本日宣言、堪稱首屈一指、此際問題癥結所在、非爲法德兩國間之積世傾軋、蓋德國所破壞之的束、匪特牽涉法國、卽比國亦受其影響故也、張氏追述去年三月間首相鮑爾溫之言、卽「英國國界、不在杜佛海岸、而在萊茵河畔」一語、謂「此際戚受危險者、不僅法比兩國、卽英國亦然、蓋就英國安全言之、法比兩國之自由與獨立、關係綦重、目前較之、已往任何時期、允爲甚也、今後歐洲各國問關係、常以何項基礎爲依據、此實最重要之問題、蓋德國是吾容許四鄰各國、與之維持正常關係、又該國是吾遵守共所自由接受之諾言、抑或此種諾言、僅可的束他國、而德國則可隨時棄若敝屣、均當有所確定故也」、張伯倫爵士最後述及希特勒元首之建議、謂雖足以使人寬慰、「惜乎言行不足以相副耳、」其中二十五年和平計劃一項、亦係徒託空言、則以凱洛克非戰公約、德國同係簽字國、自不能利用戰事、以爲國家政策之工具故也、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>前外相張伯倫并宣稱、今日眞正之爭點、乃爲將來其武力勝利乎、抑法律勝利乎、如條約之信用不能設法使恢復、則無締結新約之可能、希特勒已發種種保證之言矣、但未見其有保證之行爲、希氏曾提出二十五年和平之建議、但德國在凱洛格公約下已受永不得以戰爭爲政策工具之約束、德國聲明願復返國聯、此顯爲要求收回其殖民地初步、德國近作之反猶太主義與以戰爭爲榮之舉動、今所應解决者爲此種大事而非爲如重佔萊茵地之小事也、苟非吾人獲有敎訓、則吾人將迅速復見新的一九一四年、</p>
<p>邱吉爾繼起致詞謂眞正問題不在萊茵地之重佔、而在德國之重整軍備、爲德國軍備膨脹所驚擾之各國今應在國聯盟的下締結互助公約、凡吾人不願加諸自己之辦法、不應加諸德國、德國土地之安全、應予以擔保、不獨在萊茵决要問題上、卽在德國重置軍備極大問題上、各國應集體的向德國交涉、且必須請德國申述其苦云、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>繼由反對黨議員阿特里發言稱讚外相辦理困難談判之手腕、並贊助其政策、謂工黨贊同邀請德國加入國聯、惟德國今已失信用、尚未得其遵守後此的言之表示而邀之加入、謂能建成集體安全制、亦徒託空談耳、各國今應主張使德國於和平與安全有所貢獻、</p>
<p>財相張伯倫爲政府結束辯論曰、吾人今須經歷長程、而後始能依賴國聯諸會員合作懲治侵略者、同時吾人必須以爲洛迦諾之協定鞏固國聯、財相决述及喬治之問話、卽英法參謀長所訂之契的、是吾使英國負有協同法國驅走萊茵地德軍之義務、曰、「絕未有之」、繼謂德國於恢復共信用一節尚無所供獻、吾人所欲者、爲德國向他國證明彼之前來參與會議、乃抱獲一滿意解决之眞正志願耳、財相發言畢、未付表决、卽散會、（二十六日路透電）</p>

<p>完成、</p>
<p>工程及經費</p>

<p>該路自去年十月間、開始勘測、十一月下</p>
<p>旬分段開工、現除盤江以西、尙有三十公</p>
<p>里未測完外、餘均已測畢開工、至建築費</p>
<p>、若照嚴格乏公路標準設計、每公里的需</p>
<p>一萬元、現因時間短促、經費困難、估擬</p>
<p>工程概算、的需洋共九十一萬元、惟黔省</p>
<p>財力支絀、此項建築費、大部份須請求中</p>
<p>央撥補、中央又因財力困難、僅核准補助</p>
<p>四十萬元、故該路工程、只能以經費範圍</p>
<p>內計劃施工、現行營公路處及黔省府、均</p>
<p>擬設法增補經費、庶得如期完成、</p>

<p>貴束路、卽湘黔公路</p>
<p>黔境一段除貴陽至</p>
<p>平越甘巴哨一段、早</p>
<p>經完成通車外、現僅自平越甘巴哨至王</p>

<p>百七十五華里、的有二百五十公里、原由</p>
<p>勦匪第二路軍總指揮部成立湘黔路貴東</p>

<p>費不充、對於路綫之選擇、坡度灣道之配</p>
<p>置、及橋樑涵洞之設備、均欠完善、故路</p>
<p>基雖成、而車行危險、嗣經行營公路處派</p>
<p>員勘察、以施秉段之鵝翅膀、鎭遠段之文</p>
<p>德關鎭雄關、三穗段之盤山嚮水、淸溪段</p>
<p>仙人橋等處、路錢急坡之大、恒在百分之</p>

<p>貴北路、卽公路</p>
<p>黔境一段、前貴州省</p>
<p>主席周西成、爲軍事關係、成立路政局、</p>
<p>修築貴赤馬路、路綫由貴陽經息烽·遵義</p>
<p>。桐梓　水·以至赤水、修至桐梓後、因</p>
<p>黔省政變中止、迨毛光翔主黔、欲溝通川</p>
<p>黔兩省交通、乃派前建設廳長賓居仁、與</p>
<p>川省會勘路綫、以崇溪河爲交點、委公路</p>
<p>局副局長劉節光、督修桐崇叚工程、以鹽</p>
<p>稅附加爲經費、去年春蔣委員長急欲完</p>
<p>成川黔路、仍委劉氏負責桐崇一叚、又由</p>
<p>參謀團委派參謀陳克明監修、由陳參議</p>
<p>估計預算、轉呈批准、共爲十萬餘元、後</p>
<p>劉因故覇獄卽由陳參議主持、其中烏江</p>
<p>一叚、則由駐黔綏靖公署兵工修築、至去</p>
<p>年六月、桐崇叚土路完成、同時川境，一叚</p>
<p>亦竣、於是由貴陽可以直達重慶、</p>
<p>整理之狀況</p>
<p>本路由貴陽至溪</p>
<p>河、共長的三六零公</p>
<p>里、因地勢險峻、山陵重疊又以修築過程</p>
<p>複雜、工程多不合標準、行車每多危險、</p>
<p>嗣經行營公路處、派工程師吳國允踏勘、</p>
<p>茲將其報告現狀、節錄如次、　貴桐叚</p>
<p>該叚原未詳細測量、大多依原地形爲之、</p>
<p>故平地亦多灣道、坡度起伏不定、且路基</p>
<p>崩壞過甚、凹凸不平、山坡路綫、多　狹</p>
<p>開到車二次、始能前進、且急峻之彎道、</p>
<p>每有峭峻之坡度、乘客過此、無不提心吊</p>
<p>膽、至橋涵水溝亦過少、不足排洩水量、</p>
<p>其已有者。又多數朽壞、　桐崇叚、此叚</p>
<p>係全綫工程最困難處、雖僅一六零餘華</p>
<p>里、而山勢陡峻、道路崎嶇、凡困難之處、</p>
<p>概未完工、坡度有數處、竟大至百分之二</p>
<p>十五、其百分之十七八者、比比也、且大</p>
<p>坡度處多急灣、而下山路綫中、又有上坡</p>
<p>、益令坡度增大、故根本修理、非加改綫</p>
<p>不可其山勢陡峻、外面無法塡土處、、所</p>
<p>砌駁岸、堆砌頗不合法、致一經大雨、多</p>
<p>遭坍塌、致洩水設備之不完全、較貴桐叚</p>
<p>尤甚、路面少數舖設、橋樑歸重要者、</p>
<p>爲三义河橋、全長二十公尺、甫經完工、</p>
<p>卽爲大水冲毀無遺、現以木便橋聯絡之、</p>
<p>觀此、可的略知其危險情形矣、蔣委員長</p>
<p>以此路非急謀改善不可、嚴令行營公路</p>
<p>處、及黔省政府、負責改修、乃於去年十</p>
<p>有間、組織整理貴北路工程事務所、委員</p>
<p>州建設慶長諶湛溪兼主任、工程程師吳聞</p>
<p>允副之、先修改貴陽桐梓間之烏江北岸</p>
<p>路綫、及碼頭與橋涵水溝等工程、則先組</p>
<p>測量隊、從事測量、逐叚施工、至貴桐叚</p>
<p>整理工程、自開工後、由諶廳長駐桐督催</p>
<p>、數月來、該路工程、已成十分之八九、不</p>
<p>日卽可全部竣功、</p>

<p>鐵路航空公路三項、航空運輸、去年京滇</p>
<p>錢、雖已開航、但限於載重、不適於一般</p>
<p>普通社會之需要、兼之黔滇間氣候不良、</p>
<p>雨霧瀰漫、航路常告梗阻、且常發生危險</p>
<p>、公路亦只能便利軍事、及輕工業品之運</p>
<p>輸、至於根本之圖、仍有賴於鐵路、邇者</p>
<p>西南鐵路、已由當局積極籌備、甚望國人</p>

<h3 id="c74">銀行票據承兌所　昨舉行第一次大會 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>所員三十八家通過新華銀行加入</p>
<p>承兌總額三千零四十九萬五千元</p>
<p>規定貸物種類迥現及重貼現辦法</p>
<p>上海市銀行業同業公會聯合準備委員會、附設之「銀行票據承兌所、」自本月</p>
<p>十六日組織成立、開始辦公以來、內部手績、均已齊備、所員銀行、認繳承兌</p>
<p>基金、業已全數繳足、特於昨日下午四時、在香港路銀行俱樂部舉行成立</p>
<p>後第一决大會、報告經過情形、到全體所員銀行代表吳蘊齋·孫景西·王伯</p>
<p>元·楊介眉·等三十餘人、由李馥蓀主席、開會如儀後、首由主席略述承兌所</p>
<p>之成立、與發展票據貼現制度之需耍、繼由該所經理朱博泉報告成立以來經</p>
<p>過情形、並通過新華銀行加入聯合準備會爲委員銀行之議案一伴、茲將各情</p>
<p>分誌如下、</p>
<p>主席致詞</p>
<p>李馥蓀主席致詞云、過</p>
<p>去上海的金融組織、本</p>
<p>來有許多不完備的地主、最重要的、如缺</p>
<p>少票據交換所及、票據貼現制度等組織、</p>
<p>使同業感覺到種種的不便、所以本會成</p>
<p>立後、第一伴事情、就是組織票據交換</p>
<p>所、現在交換所辦得已有成績了、而票據</p>
<p>貼現制度的發展、至今尚無頭緒、因爲沒</p>
<p>有貼現制度、所以同業資金的運用、不能</p>
<p>活潑如意、遇着市面壞的時候、平時放出</p>
<p>的欵項、就變成帳面呆滯、無法流通、常</p>
<p>有周轉不靈之苦、目前市面的呆滯、一般</p>
<p>同業資金運用能力的减縮、就是沒有貼</p>
<p>現制度的緣故、欲發展貼現制度、應先發</p>
<p>展貼現票據、有了票據、如果沒有「貼現</p>
<p>市塲、」使持有票據者、沒有隨時可以貼</p>
<p>現的機會、貼現的作用、依然不能盡量發</p>
<p>揮、因此、我同業决定由我們自己來組織</p>
<p>一個「銀行票據承兌所、」創造一種貼現</p>
<p>票據出來、這種票據、由承兌所所員銀行</p>
<p>發票、歸承兌所承兌、其形式與普通「銀</p>
<p>行承兌匯票相同、本所「承兌匯票、」以</p>
<p>所員銀行已經貼現的商業票據、及其他</p>
<p>資產爲擔保、一經承兌之後、由本所訂定</p>
<p>一種貼現交易辦法、使持有本所承兌匯</p>
<p>票的同業、有隨時可以變現的機會、具有</p>
<p>「貼現市塲的雛形、這樣、同業放出的欵</p>
<p>項、一部份本來是固定資產、現在用本所</p>
<p>承兌匯票來代替、就可變爲流動資產了、</p>
<p>同時、本所承兌匯票、保障殷厚、性質靈</p>
<p>活、各同業大家可以利用其餘資來貼現、</p>
<p>因貼現而買入的票據、可以存儲生息、必</p>
<p>要時仍可隨時向同業轉貼現、或向中中</p>
<p>交三行重貼現、貼現付出之餘資、仍與存</p>
<p>儲自己庫中無異、雖平時營業準備金數</p>
<p>目稍减、亦有恃無恐、並且貼現的利息、</p>
<p>通常比較一斑的利息爲低、將來貼現票</p>
<p>據發達、整個市塲的利息、亦可壓低、增</p>
<p>加同業的流動資產、酌减平時的營業準</p>
<p>備金、無形中就是增加同業資金的運用</p>
<p>力量、推廣同業的業務、增加同業經營的</p>
<p>利益、不過最要緊的、還是要我同業能够</p>
<p>盡量利用這種力量、來扶植工商業、使工</p>
<p>商業亦可沾到不少的利益、我們極誠懇</p>
<p>的希望各同業大家來利用本所的「承兌</p>
<p>匯票、」使目前這種僵持了的局面、可以</p>
<p>漸漸地活動起來、使將來「貼現票據」「</p>
<p>貼現市塲」「重貼現」三者同時發展、而</p>
<p>造成一完美的貼現制度、關於本所成立</p>
<p>經過、及現在進行諸事、請朱經理詳細報</p>

<p>該所爲便利各行對於該</p>

<p>買賣之數量與利率、通知該所、至雙方所</p>

<p>兩輪均受重大損傷</p>
<p>招商局之公平輪、載重二七零五噸、長三</p>
<p>二零英尺、闊四六英尺、深二一英尺一</p>
<p>寸、吃水一六英尺二寸、有兩層台甲、馬</p>

<p>未出黃埔港內、而已肇</p>
<p>巨禍、蓋據船主　Gun</p>
<p>ker（俄人）報告、此時</p>
<p>港內有霧、正由船主值班、（凡航行港內</p>
<p>均船主自負駕駛責任）公平輪前進之時、</p>
<p>乃遇忌利土洋行閩粵班輪海澄號、（的三</p>
<p>千六百噸）由閩載大批貨客至廣州、海澄</p>
<p>輪速度强、行駛快、與公平輪相値時、彼</p>
<p>此以重霧關係、不及預先避讓、致公平之</p>
<p>船首側、向海澄中艙部分猛撞、當時雙方</p>
<p>咸受重大創傷、</p>
<p>公平破兩洞</p>

<p>前水艙、立時進水、又船</p>
<p>首左側鐵錨、且遭碰碎、可以見當時相撞</p>

<p>損壞、一面再看海澄受傷情形、</p>
<p>海澄受重傷</p>
<p>海澄輪與公平猛撞時、</p>
<p>猶不及停車止航、而因</p>
<p>其速率强大、故一碰之</p>
<p>下、海澄輪自中艙機器</p>
<p>間起、直至船尾、均遭撞</p>
<p>壞、而機器間更撞一大</p>
<p>洞、故損害允較公平爲重、海澄內貨客較</p>
<p>公平爲多、出事後、除船主會同公平船</p>
<p>主、互相觀看簽證外、海澄卽設法駛至碼</p>
<p>頭、卸除貨客、以便由公正人檢騐後、卽</p>
<p>行大修、</p>
<p>公平昨到滬</p>
<p>公平輪碰撞後、已不能</p>
<p>航行、頭水艙內、泊泊浸</p>
<p>水、情勢危險、船主急卽</p>
<p>退返廣州碼頭、先用水</p>
<p>泥木板等、將兩個破洞</p>
<p>塡補、然後抽去入艙之</p>
<p>水、致公平在粵、又多停三天之久、至二</p>
<p>十一日晨、始於兩洞補牢後、再開來滬、</p>
<p>至昨晨上午七時半、進吳淞口、當卽開至</p>
<p>華棧卸糖、而船主乃到局報告肇禍及撞</p>
<p>碰經過、一面通告保險行、請派員查騐、</p>
<p>勘騐後修理</p>
<p>公平船抵上海、停泊金</p>
<p>利源碼頭江面、招商局</p>
<p>派由總工程師曹守廉君</p>
<p>到船騐勘、並傳詢船主</p>

<p>看守馬獻祥前來、向我說顧竹軒的案子、</p>
<p>捕房與法院均經疏通好了、憑爾一人咬</p>
<p>他也無用、落得做好人拿些錢用用、趙廣</p>

<p>意、我就問他多少錢、他說三千塊錢、他</p>
<p>從中要五百元佣金、民人儘得二千五百</p>
<p>元、當時民人向馬謂曰、須得證據後方可</p>

<p>風濕內蘊。餘毒入骨。其始先現骨節痠痛。如延不洽療。卽增劇成爲四肢麻木不仁。更劇則半身不遂。全體瘓癱。行動失去自由。等於殘廢矣。</p>
<p>去秋有患者梁義本來訴有風濕骨痛。手足麻木等症。迭洽未效。余診得梁君且係餘毒未凈所致。卽囑向永安公司西藥部購服「强斯登氏骨痛片」。祛風濕。搜餘毒。骨節卽感舒暢。手足亦形靈活。連服數盒。克奏根治奇效。欣欣稱謝而去云。</p>

<p>— 賈治中</p>
<p>吾曾加以統計。戒烟兼訴胃痛者。占十之七八。如不先根治其胃痛。則無由竣安全戒烟之全功也。</p>
<p>然因胃痛病源紛歧。用藥亦未可局限一端。要以去炎解酸。護膜生新。鎭痛止抽爲主。如同時輔以强壯胃臟培補胃臟之劑。則亢進其食慾。助長其消化。積弱之胃臟。始可回復壯健也。</p>
<p>如最近有馬際唐君者。其所罹之久遠胃症。已自視爲莫治。祇以烟癮染身。不容不戒。前月始自投余處求戒。經余囑向中法藥房購服「胃痛靈」去其胃病之根。而以「健胃素」壯健之。至於搜姻毒斷烟癮。則服强身治病之「生殖素」。服後精神愉快。且因胃痛根治。馬君欣慰莫名。的四星期。卽告脫離黑籍云。</p>

<p>— 兪伯符</p>
<p>婦女小腹。部在子宮。如覺痛感。大都係子宮炎症所致。如延不治療。則月經不調。赤白帶下等症。紛起沓來，自此多病多患矣。</p>
<p>患者鄒女士。去秋由其女友湯女士介紹來診。訴有經來腹痛及帶下之苦。余察得係子宮炎症所致。卽囑向五洲藥房指購「女用生殖素」以去炎暖宮。調經療帶。並爲使其迅速治療起見。同時囑外用「療帶靈」。內外兼施。爲期半月。回復壯健。重獲靑春。欣欣稱謝而去云喬文彬</p>

<p>— 喬文彬</p>
<p>遺精與戒烟。雖截然兩事。然有一同樣之痛苦。卽精神萎靡也。</p>
<p>夫遺精者。或失眠。或多夢。或心悸健忘。或神思恍惚。遺後醒來。頭暈腦眩。懊喪萬狀。精神頹唐。悲觀叢生。而戒烟者則習慣暴改。生理驟起變化。宛如置身另一世界。坐立不寗。笑啼皆非。精神痛苦。等於失戀。雖抱有絕大决心。立志求戒者。亦往往眷烟戀烟。念念難捨也。</p>
<p>是故戒烟要訣。首在解除戒者精神上之痛苦。「生殖素」對於去毒斷癮之功。業爲已戒着所讚頌。而其使精神煥發安全愉快之效。允爲吾人所賞用。上月余曾以「希米脫氏固精片」治愈患者卞濟川之遺精。而以「生殖素」安全戒其烟癮。可爲唯一鐵證云。</p>

<p>去秋有同鄉富紳王行高君者。因在少壯時代。飽受風濕。致罹骨節痠痛。迭治失效。遷延多年。成爲瘓癱。由余臨診。經余囑向華美藥房購服「强斯登氏骨痛片」。服後骨節筋絡。兩感舒適。臨診數决。卽能起床。卽安心連服數盒。頓告根治。日前蒙親來余處道謝。並賜區額。余視其腰背輕健之態。大有生龍活虎之概云。</p>

<p>（安慶李永昌君來函云）余因在少年時代。手淫斲喪過度。致先後罹有遺精早洩之苦。迭經醫藥。功效殊鮮。遷延因循。病勢日甚。去秋因見本刋載有某君。與余同病。由詹念曾醫師用名藥「希米脫氏固精片」及「生殖素」並服治愈。卽亦向上海中英藥房函購各三盒。因服後功效顯著。卽續服三盒。前後共服半打。現在不惟兩症俱告霍然。且精足神旺。身壯體健。生機重萌。回復靑春。不啻再造云。</p>

<p>王壁山遺址文化時代（一）</p>
<p>蔣大沂君前日在蘇州萃英中學演講、題爲王壁</p>
<p>山遣址文化之時代、原文如下、</p>
<p>在座諸君子、今天鄙人有機會同諸位這樣地歡</p>
<p>聚一堂、實在是件非常榮幸的事、本來金松岑先</p>
<p>生和這裹校長先生的鄙人上星期五下午到這裹</p>
<p>來、可是事情不凑巧的很、那一天的下午、預先</p>
<p>已經約定了上海的幾位友人到虎邱山去調查古</p>
<p>跡、他們都在學校裏擔任功課星期五不是例假、</p>
<p>是特成請了假到蘇州來的、所以那天鄙人不得</p>
<p>不陪了他們一起去、不得不將到這裏的時間延</p>
<p>遲到了今天、實在很對諸位不起、這應當先向諸</p>
<p>位鄭重道歉的、</p>
<p>金松岑先生和道裏校長先生的鄙人到這裏來、</p>
<p>實在鄙人不學無術、一點東西也沒有可以供默</p>
<p>給諸位、然而二先生生的盛意是不應當過事辜</p>
<p>負的、所以鄙人忘其愚昧、願意在這裏將「王壁</p>
<p>山遺址文化之時代」一個問題提出、同諸位討論</p>
<p>一下、</p>
<p>遺址之位置在去年的十一月廿四日、鄙人</p>
<p>和一位曹華丹先生找到了一個王壁山文化遺址</p>
<p>、地位在我們蘇州城外西南方離城八九里遠近</p>
<p>近的新郭鎭、地當石湖的東北角、屬舊吳境的一</p>
<p>都廿四圖、有一條大路東西橫貫在這遺址中間、</p>
<p>叫做行春橋大街、是直通新郭鎭大街的通衢、另</p>
<p>有一條大路環繞着遺址的西南方、可以通往蠡</p>
<p>墅鎭、河流環繞在遺址的西北方、可通舟揖、在</p>
<p>遺址的南面、有一座很富詩意的第宅、爲余冰人</p>
<p>覺先生的產業、據李印泉先生的考證、這地方應</p>
<p>當便是宋代范成大石湖別墅裏天鏡閣的故址、</p>
<p>遺址的西邊有一條高橋、叫做越城橋也、便是吳</p>
<p>郡志上的越來溪橋、橋下和石湖水相接的一條</p>
<p>河流、是橫塘河也、便是典藉上的北越來溪、在</p>
<p>越城橋的西邊、又有一條長橋橫臥在石湖上面、</p>
<p>道是我們蘇州很有名的行春橋、廢歷八月中、大</p>
<p>家上石湖看串月、便在這僩地方、過了行春橋「</p>
<p>那已到石湖的西岸、沿岸有磨盤山、上方山等諸</p>
<p>小山、這種小山、都是七子山東北方的小山峯、</p>
<p>古時七子山叫做橫山、這磨盤山、上方山峯也還</p>
<p>沒有獨立的名稱、一起叫做橫山、（說證見王文</p>
<p>恪姑蘇志）所以從古代的地名說來、這個遺址是</p>
<p>在橫下的東方、若就橫山的主峯而言、則也可說</p>
<p>是在橫山下的東北方、</p>

<p>能解答練習書中的習題·</p>
<p>關於該校的訓育牧施可分積極的與消極的</p>
<p>兩方面來講積極的方面該校注重敎師人格的感</p>
<p>化與間接的暗示。據該校校長的意見，該校敎</p>
<p>師雖有敎師的尊嚴，但是從未用過這種尊嚴去</p>
<p>壓迫或制服學生。該校敎師常用人格感化的方</p>
<p>法增進敎帥與學生之間的友誼關係，使學生</p>
<p>在敎帥人格的陶溶之中能有自動的覺悟，並能</p>
<p>自動地去改進自身的行爲。所謂間接的暗示是</p>
<p>指藉着環境的壓力和團體的制裁來促進學生行</p>
<p>爲的改善。譬如說，一個新入學的學生身體和</p>
<p>衣服方面都欠淸潔；該校當局並不立即訓練這</p>
<p>個學生，使他身體和衣服整潔。但是這個學生</p>
<p>加入了學校的環境以後，他會不知不覺地感覺</p>
<p>到自己不整潔的身體和衣服是不能適應這種整</p>
<p>潔的環境，因此他會自動　改善。假如他處在</p>
<p>這種環境之中而仍無自動的感覺，則其他的同</p>
<p>學就要給他一種指示，或甚至通知他必須有某</p>
<p>種的改進；吾則團體就要鄙視他或棄絕他。所</p>
<p>以他處在這種良好的團體生活中，受着環境的</p>
<p>壓力和團體的制裁，必須改正個人的行爲以適</p>
<p>應環境。</p>
<p>至於消極方面的訓育設施，該校平時多用</p>
<p>記過的方法。醫如，某生遲到幾决就要記幾個</p>
<p>小過。記滿若干小過以後，就要剝奪某種權利</p>
<p>；這種權利的剝奪是不致妨碍他的身心和學業</p>
<p>的。假如他能改正過來，則所剝奪的權利亦可</p>
<p>准予恢復，使他能有自新的機會。假如學生違</p>
<p>犯了重大的過失，則由校長詳細研究這種問題</p>
<p>的兒童，而予以適當的解决或處罰。必要時，</p>
<p>校長可用體罰，停學，除名等嚴厲的處罰來對</p>
<p>付頑劣的學生。但是據該校校長的報告，道些</p>
<p>嚴厲的處罰方法是很少用到的。</p>

<p>對無希望之九六公債、則反會有一度之妄抬、自</p>

<p>— 何伯雄</p>
<p>查一年來政府所公佈之平衡稅，可分爲兩</p>
<p>時期，第一爲去年十一月三日新貨幣法案公佈</p>
<p>以前，第二爲十一月三日新貨幣法案公佈以後</p>
<p>，新貨幣法案公佈以前之平衡稅，並未按照定</p>
<p>則徵收，及十一月四日實行以後，政府所公佈</p>
<p>之平衡稅，不但不少於理論上應有之平衡稅而</p>
<p>且時有過之，試觀下表：（註十）</p>
<p>故十一月十日以前，由上　運銀至倫敦，</p>
<p>仍有大利可圖，每百元輸出之純益，除去運費</p>
<p>之外，可有二十六元左右至四十一元左右之譜</p>
<p>，政府並未完全以平衡稅之手段，限制白銀之</p>
<p>輸出也。因此截止二十四年一月底，上海各銀</p>
<p>行之現銀存底，統計祗及三萬萬三千五百萬</p>
<p>，較上年同期竟减少達二萬萬二千五百萬元以</p>
<p>上。與二十二年一年問之最高鶴相較，减少</p>
<p>將及三萬萬元。二月底較上月父减少二百十</p>
<p>餘萬元，三月底又較上月底减少九百餘萬，</p>
<p>四月五月份均略爲增加，六月份庫有略　，良</p>
<p>以內地小麥上市正當旺盛之際，復以時近端節</p>
<p>，各地銀根極爲緊迫，需要現銀毀切，故是月</p>
<p>份銀元稍有移入內地也。七八月份，因內地</p>
<p>產品秋熟將屆，需要現洋尤爲殷切，兩月中移</p>
<p>出達四五百萬也，運往漢口二百四十萬元，</p>
<p>京天津及北平等處，各有五十萬左右。自九月</p>
<p>以至十月十一月，各有現銀輸入，蓋因上海金</p>
<p>融日見穩定，滙價日縮，國外銀價亦不若以前</p>
<p>之猛漲，因此以前裝運出口之現洋陸續運回，</p>
<p>然華洋銀行庫存對存底總計所佔之百分率，則</p>
<p>華商各銀行猶遠高於洋商各銀行焉。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c144">日本女子的職業觀 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— 一髮</p>
<p>在賢母良妻的敎育方法下產生的日本女性，當然有伊們的特性。伊們只走到和男子平等的職業，而尚沒有踏進參政的一步。從前的日本女子，只做些侍女歌妓等下級的職業。量近女子的職業範圍已相當擴大，很有和男子在同一水平錢上的可能。允其是小學敎員中，女子已有替代男子的現象。但是一般的職業，仍舊是在男子指導之下，勞働着罷了。以職業地位而論，或者還不及我國的女子呢。</p>
<p>農村的婦女也能和男子同樣的在田裏耕作着，除了烹調煮飯之外，尚要採柴育兒。在事實上，要較男子爲勞苦。而沿海女子，能終日赤裸着在海底下捕魚捉蚌，名日海女。其耐苦勤勞，雖男子亦較之遜色。時代之輪轉變着，農村裏的少女，拚命到都市裏去，於是發生了許多新的職業。</p>
<p>咖啡館酒店的侍女，在日本女子職業中，佔很重要的地位。終日笑靨迎人，爲客侑酒。因環境的關係，常把優良的女子，墮入深淵。此種職業，雖亦爲人鄙視，但咖啡酒館的發達，却仍是與日俱增。銀座的大咖啡館和酒館，常雇有侍女二三百人之多。普通較小的也是終年懸着招募侍女的佈告。所以靑年美貌的女子，在沒有職業的時候，爲咖啡館侍女是十分容易的，這是日本女子職業的特殊現象。</p>
<p>公共食堂及大商店，已全是女子職員。男職員反而站在旁邊，相形見絀了。他們很能得顧客的讚美，而忠於自己的職務。殷勤招待，禮貌周到，較男子爲甚。而顧客及男職員亦都能互相尊敬，故邪狎戲謔者不多，是値得讚美的。</p>
<p>公共汽車的全部及電車賣票的一部，亦已採用女子。伊們能熟諳煩瑣的事情，說明停車站的地名，對老者和兒童更扶提相助。故常有感恩的民衆，匿名的將禮金贈與女賣票者，傳爲美談。其他戲院電影院的賣票等，差不多盡是女子。所以日本的女子已將賣票員的職位，全部包辦着。除了火車站的賣票員，雇用女子的還不多</p>
<p>雇用女傭及蓄婢制，在日本還盛行着，女傭管理淸潔掃除烹調洗濯等職。婢女常用以看守小孩，待遇和我國相近。非中等階級以上，無力雇用。日本普通商店大都是家庭化的副業式，故主婦除了家務之外，亦常要管理店務。所以商店可以减少雇員的支出，容易維持。伊們所受敎育的程度雖達中學以上，對管理小商店及作小職員，並不爲恥，和我國一般已受新敎育女子的絕不相同的。</p>
<p>銀行及公共團體等，雖亦有女子職員，但均地位不高，作收發招待導者而已。所以日本女子的職業，是在男子支配之下的，或是侍奉人家的。</p>
<h3 id="c145">婦女與兒童音樂教育 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 沙梅</p>
<p>中國學院派的音樂運動之所以未得着廣大的開展，自然這是有着客觀與主觀上的原因的，不過從音運的本身去看，那主要的原因，除了是受了中國整個文化的支配以外，那就是一貫地忽視了兒童音樂運動，卽所謂音樂之基本政策的問題。</p>
<p>兒童音樂要是得着高度的開展，那就會產生大量的音樂家的細胞，至少，可造出不少的純正音樂賞鑑者的種子。這都是可以預料的事實。</p>
<p>兒童音運的進路是兒童音樂敎育，這卽是說兒童音樂敎育若發達，那兒童的音樂智識才會普編，結果，兒童的音樂活動也就容易擴大。</p>
<p>婦女一貫地就接近兒童，所以對於兒童音樂敎育的發展，從原則上事實上婦女應負起特殊的任務的。至少，對啓發的音樂敎育，不能諉其責任的。</p>
<p>同時，婦女似乎天然就富於音樂情緒，雖然把世界上的音樂家統計起來，婦女佔極少數，但這不能證明婦女的音樂能力特別比男子低，而是因爲婦女爲了子女與家庭的障礙，不能始終貫徹於音樂的修養，而且常因結婚後，簡直就停</p>
<p>止了努力，不過將婦女已經所得的音樂智識從事於兒童音樂敎育，那是最適當而且兒童也容易接受的。</p>
<p>婦女對兒童天然的有種軟性態度，從事於兒童音樂敎育就正需要的是這種態度。在歐洲，特別是美國的小學音樂敎師大半都是女子，這是說明了婦女很適宜於這種事業。比如說，孩子出世以後，所聽的首先就是他母親的催眠歌。</p>
<p>考察大音樂家們，其初步的音樂修養，差不多都是從母親那兒得來的。</p>
<h3 id="c146">營養不良的小孩病 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— 聿秀</p>
<p>小孩營養問題，最難應付。做母親的，對於子女的食物配置，實是一件非常困難的事情。常見小孩面黃肌瘦。哭泣無已時。使做母親的。日不得安，夜不得眠。這是小孩因營養不良而致病的普通現象。具體說來。如消瘦病。軟骨病。脚氣病。壞血病等，都是由於營養不良而起的。現在把這類疾病的病狀及平時食物應注意的略加說明。以佻母親們的參考。其病較厲害的，仍須就醫診治。</p>
<p>軟骨症</p>
<p>原因在很多、歸緊要者，一，因有孕之婦，尙哺乳，使母體內之鈣質不及應付，二，缺乏食物中的維生素丁Vitamine　D.　三，缺乏脂肪類要質，並因起居不合衛生。</p>
<p>此症症狀，多半在小孩出牙時期，（輕者，不易覺察。）如略發熱，煩躁，睡眠不安，能步行者，則步態軟弱，不喜行走，重者，肌之狀甚顯，或竟癱瘓，前後囱門不閉，牙小而奇異，骨端變大，皮色蒼白等。</p>
<p>壞血病</p>
<p>原因是缺乏食物中的維生素丙　Vilamine　C．在船上生活的，不易得到新鮮食物常有此病。</p>
<p>症狀如體重减輕，虛弱，面色蒼白，齒根彩如海綿狀，易出血，口臭甚惡，心跳，頭痛等。小兒重者，骨骼與骨幹脫離。</p>
<p>脚報病</p>
<p>原缺乏食物中的維生素乙　Vitamine　B.　吃機製白米易患此病。</p>
<p>嬰兒患此病，幾小時能致死亡（症狀類後）。年歲較大者，則有心跳，水腫（有時無）麻痺，四肢軟弱，腹部不舒，面色靑白，四肢或癱，有時胃口失，噁心，嘔吐，等。症狀。</p>
<p>營養上的注意</p>
<p>講起營養問題，自以新鮮牛奶爲最好的食物，因其最多的維生素但價太貴，經濟上成問題，並有許多地方不易買到，普通可用荳漿代之，每日應吃二三磅。蛋，肝，（猪肝牛肝）宜常用，因含維生業亦多。菜類，各種菜類，如青菜，白菜，芥藍菜，菠菜，都含有維生素甲，乙，丙，丁，小兒能吃者，要他多吃，哺乳者，可煮湯，或做菜泥吃。水菓，如橙，葡萄，檸檬，橘子，蕃茄（蕃茄所含之質，與橘子同，但價較賤），葡萄等有維生紫乙丙。水菓味好，並開胃口。米不宜用全白的，宜用糙米，常吃麵類食物，以防脚氣病。荳類亦宜常用，非但能阻止脚氣病，並多含炭水化合物，能使肥胖。多該新鮮牛肉汁，或肉湯，薯湯，橘子汁爲預防血病之一重食物。嬰兒五六月時，就須加橘子汁於乳內。軟骨症最佳之飮食，爲母乳，嬰兒飮母乳時，可加大麥湯，米泔水等。</p>
<p>各類食物，宜煮軟，易於消化，不宜煎炒。</p>

<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>——精明果敢爲男子所不及——</p>
<p>羅斯福夫人入主白宮之後，兩年之中，旅行過四萬英里的路程，演講過九十二决，收到十萬零五千信件，替美國互助會播音演講，得到過三萬六千元美余的報酬。這些紀錄，已很可表示伊在怎樣的活動，而且伊自任白宮主婦而後，一個大家庭中，一切家事，全由伊指導。每個總統夫人都是這樣，進了白宮，所有的慈善機關，都要來捐欵，伊當然依照羅斯福家庭的慈善爲懷而多少捐助一些。</p>
<p>和伊接近的人，任何人知道伊不會失去一些精力和樂觀的，雖然對於種種活動和演講，兩年之中，是這樣的煩忙。在未來一年之中，每星期內所應做的工作，伊在上一個年頭，早已計劃定當了，不過長距離旅行，事前不能光行定當的。</p>
<p>是前年吧，伊會到過，巴多利哥和維爾京羣島去考察過慈善事業，上年度伊老早會預備到檀香山去，在夏天的時節，實行到森林裏消夏，但結果又因爲事情忙而不去。</p>
<p>羅斯福夫人坐飛機到巴多利哥的那回，在一九三四年的旅行表上，那並不是最遠的一次，因爲伊還到距離有六，六三二八英里的維爾京島上去，至於下了飛機，坐小船到島七的旅程，還沒有計算在裏面。</p>
<p>當伊前年的夏天，到太平洋海岸迎接羅斯福總統，由檀香山回來的一回，伊的旅程，有一〇，九七八英里。六月底伊離開華盛頓，坐在一輛新式小跑車中，這輛汽車，伊入主白宮後，還是第一次買的新車。</p>
<p>伊在旅途中，行路二，〇〇〇英里，經過西佛及尼亞，鄧納西，和康特基，七月八到達芝加哥，在路上伊在西彿及尼亞和鄧納西兩地，會經到農村裏面實地去考察社會問題。</p>
<p>自芝加加哥到沙加莫多一段，伊是坐飛機去的，全程一，九一九九哩，從此伊的旅行生活，已有一月之久，加州的新聞紙都說伊在泰福湖，因爲伊的愛女達爾夫人那時正在鬧離婚問題。</p>
<p>是伊後來又在楊湖和郁斯密脫山谷就　了一個星期。最後又趕到太平洋接羅期福。接着和總統等一行人衆，又至各地去考察；總之，伊的四萬英里旅程，有貼近伊的人加以統計，以非常準確的。</p>
<p>羅斯福夫人所接到的來信。每天不斷的寄至白宮，兩　中的確沒有一天間斷過，不過道些來信，內中大多數伊是沒有看過，關於詢問政治問題的，交給政府方面作復，而共他信件，便由伊的忔答復的。</p>
<p>然而內中有很多信件，祇由伊一人拆　的，大槪道這種信都是在經濟方面，情感方面予以帮助的，可能的話，這種信是有滿意的答復的，不過要求伊私人方面捐欵的信件，也由秘書處理，因爲這種信有時一個星期會有三百封左右。</p>
<p>上文所說羅斯福夫人的九十二次演講，正和伊的旅行一樣，紀錄是非常可靠的，祗是少，不會多說，因爲伊隨便什麼時候發生了問題，便會演講，至於簡短而並不爲人注意的還不　在裏面，而裏所說的九十次，祇是正式的和無綫電播音演講。</p>
<p>伊在一九三四的夏天，曾經爲互助會播音演講，而取得每决美金三千元的報酬，然而這鉅額的報酬，伊後來是完全捐給慈善機關的。</p>

<h3 id="c148">上海女青年會會長　張麗珍女士訪問紀 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>上海女靑年會會長金龍章夫人赴滇後，會務便由張麗珍女士主持，這位張女士的大名，大家覺得很陌生，所以只曉得她是何林一夫人。我們提起了張麗珍，就得先說說她的父親——張蟾芬。張先生服務商務印書館多年，他眞是了不得的人，生平急公好義，熱心敎育，不但把自己的子女都栽培成功，而且手創好多個學校，敎育人家的子弟。讀者都知道上海有兩個歷史悠久的學校，一是清心中學，一是淸心女中，兩校的校長張石麟，張蓉珍，便是張先生的男女公子，他們是一門敎育家，確也値得人家欽慕的，</p>
<p>音樂的人生</p>
<p>這位麗珍女士，雖不是校長，而服務於社會敎育事業，却始終如一的勤奮人家說她是婦運領袖，又是新賢妻良母，她自己曾說：「我父親的勞動精神，有一部分已傳給我了！」於斯可見家庭敎育影響的偉大。她特別愛好音樂，從小也有點天才，當初在中西女學畢業後，便留任母校任音樂敎師，至一九一六年留學於美國啞勃林（Ｏbrlin）音樂院，刻苦硏習，造詣洪深。她回憶留美時，說過一段話：「我們同班硏究的，有些頭髮已白了，依然興會濃厚，精神比我國女子飽滿，我自己覺得用了父母的汗血錢？不敢自懈，又想一生留美的機會，恐怕只此兩年，因此加緊苦幹，生活比公費生艱苦得多。……這二十年來，還過着音樂生活，先在北平淸華大學擔任音樂指導，近數年在滬每週有四個半天任慕爾常專修科任音樂導師，音樂是我維一的嗜好，海上每有音樂會，我不是演奏」定是領略者：有入勸我可以告休，不必再幹了，但我以爲二十餘年的苦心，不忍一旦拋棄，我願此志到老勿衰！</p>
<p>童丐有生路</p>
<p>我問她現時擔任好壞幾椿社會事業，那一件做得最有趣？她說：我雖是淸心女中，普益相，女靑年會的董事，但無何貢獻，只有福童所，做得較有意義。我前在北平倒不覺得流亡的人太多，一到上海，便隨處發現許多苦難童丐，每思救濟的方法，三年前便和李整輝先生等創辦「福童所」，去年遷往江灣新址，收容孤零的童丐，施以敎育，授以工藝，使他們有一技之長，可以良立，亦是解决社會問臘的。一端·不過創設伊始，經濟不甚充裕，遝望熱心人士，盡力贊助。我覺得童丐境遇雖苦，而有天才的，刻苦自勵的，也許比富費之家的子弟，有希望得多呢。</p>
<p>婦女要自覺</p>
<p>我又問她對於現時職業婦女有何感想？她說，「職業界現有四種現象：　人人謀事，不得其事，　事事求人，不得其人；　有了事做，不肯切實負責；　保全自己地位，不管人家苦樂；這四種情形，在現社會裏，男界如此，女界亦復如此。所以婦女職業，一時還談不上發展二字。」我說那末何夫人對婦女界有何希望？「這話很難說。我的意思，只吃飯不管事的女人，應該用些腦力，做些好事：有職業的女人，要有恒心，能負責，勿存奢望心：受公家栽培過的人，格外要盡力謀公衆福利；家境優裕的夫人們，應慷慨解囊，捐助公益，體上天好生之德，勿徒作兒孫牛馬，此爲助人自助至高無上的業德！……」</p>
<h3 id="c149">法西斯主義下的婦女 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— 夢蘇</p>
<p>——剝奪女權·伸張國力——</p>
<p>在近代婦女解放聲中，偏遭到法西斯主義的蹂躪，足令三春桃李，爲之失色。</p>
<p>法西斯是霸道的武力統治，它根本反對所謂民權，所謂婦女解放。它是主張以戰士集團所擁戴的迭克推多來操縱一切。婦女不過是男性羣戰士下面的附屬品；她們只合孕育未來的戰士，以及做退伍軍人的服侍者。</p>
<p>墨沙里尼曾經率直地說：婦女的天職是服從。婦女參政易使國家的權力柔弱化。你知道盎格羅撒克遜人何以漸趨末日？便是由於女權膨脹！在我們的國家裏面，絕對談不到婦女參政。</p>
<p>法西斯制的國家，一切選舉都操縱於頒袖掌中。婦女的法西斯團體都得隸屬於男子的組織下面。女黨員須年滿二十二歲方爲合格。在政治方面，一切不能自立主張，只能跟在男黨員後面聽其指揮。</p>
<p>意大利的大學敏育本來是不拘泩別的。中年以上的女敎授，也頗有些卓著聲譽的。但從法西斯當政以後，制定了新的法規：十一歲以上的男學生，凡於養成品性有關的科目，不得用女敎師敎授。</p>
<p>女子不能當戰士，所以女子不過是戰士的生育工具。獎勵生育增加人口，是意大利對內國策之一。意大利的最低結婚年限，本定女子十五，男子十八。現在减低爲女子十四，男子十六。這樣無異乎以法律來摧殘女性，使她們走上早衰的路。</p>
<p>過去有些國家的法律上，曾容許男子鞭撻其妻，只須鞭箠之粗勿過於大拇指，便認爲無罪。現在任何國家都沒有這種不平等的法律了。意大利的新刑法，對於男子虐待妻子或兒女的處分是特別寬大的。凡男子因自己過失對於妻子濫施體罰而致傷殘或疾病的，從前要處五年以下的徒刑；現在却只施以六個月以下的拘禁。其虐待妻子致死者，昔以暴戾殺人論罪；現在却减輕爲處以八年以下的有期徒刑了。這樣，丈夫有了鞭撻妻子的自由，只耍不是打得皮穿骨折，被害方面是無處伸寃的。</p>
<p>還有，妻子如因不堪丈夫虐待而逃出夫家，得報警追緝，處妻子以一年以下的有期徒刑，或一千以上一萬以下里拉的罰金。至於丈夫不愜於妻子而棄家遠行，却不受法律制裁的。</p>
<p>意大利的現行刑法……妻子與人通姦者處二年以下有期徒刑。這是今日歐洲各國所絕無僅有的。但有婦之夫與人通姦，却非法網所禁。舊法：男子發現妻子，女兒或親生姊妹與人通姦而殺害之者，處三年至七年的有期徒刑。現在法西斯的新律，對於男子爲了名譽的動機而殺害其妻子，親女，親生姊妹的，竟特別予以寬容的處分了。</p>
<p>婦女失了貞操所得的處分如此共嚴：而男子犯姦罪的處置這樣的輕。這種畸形的法律，把婦女地位降落到怎樣的程度呢！</p>
<p>中國有吃人的禮敎，外國有吃人的法律·婦女的層層枷鎖，究竟何時纔獲得解放呢？</p>

<p>嚴寒的冬天的早晨。</p>
<p>晨鐘噹噹地打過了，但是宿舍裏的同學們還沒有起身，伊們還在溫柔暖熱的被窩裏做着緋色的綺夢咧！</p>
<p>冬天確乎冷，有尖刀也似的西北風吹在人於身上；那是多麽寒冷難當呀！難怪同學們要戀被窩呵！</p>
<p>『咦？我的襪子那兒去了』？帳幔裏的大塊頭雪那麼自問着。</p>
<p>『什麽時候啦？慧在被窩裏打着呵欠問。</p>
<p>『呀！農鐘早打過了，快吃早膳了』！芬探出了頭把手錶瞧着那麽說。</p>

<p>於是，一羣小姐們整隊向飯廳去。</p>
<p>人頭像鍊子似的彎彎地排一條，蜿蜒曲折的向飯廳的門裏塞進去；登時飯廳裏很熱鬧的都是人啦！</p>

<h3 id="c161">教化監犯 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 家爲</p>
<p>據甲社云：本市江蘇第二監獄署獄長，以教化監犯，文明各國，均極重視，故特函請中國佛教會，請指派法師蒞監演監演講佛教，俾其同澄彼岸。茲聞中國佛敎會，以該監囚犯人數之多，爲全國冠，宣傳佛敎，感化心理，實爲重要，刻已議决推鍾康侯主持其事，隨時的集法師居土，前往演講云。</p>
<p>關於獄牢里的生活，那樣悠久而不得自由的歲月，監犯們是怎樣地挨着過去，這不是我們外界的「自由人」所能知道的吧？不過，讀着報紙，我們時或可以知道一些他們那裏的零屑的片斷的生活記實。比方，某地某監獄，囚犯們因爲受不了里面所過的那種生活而羣起「絕食」以反抗。某時某監獄，因爲飮食不足而引起了囚犯們的「騷動」。此外，更有什麽老獄囚拆梢新犯人而致勁武，以至死刑犯在刑塲臨刑時，有敎徒神父們爲之祈禱，懺悔，以備入「天堂」……等等，都是囚犯們所過生活的縮形吧？</p>
<p>至於要講到獄牢裏會實施什麽敎育工作，那末除了所謂「模範監獄」，以至於特有的「反省院」等外，許通的却還沒有所聞。現在，本市的第二監獄，果然「重視」起監犯的「敎化工作」，這不能不設是一件可喜的事！</p>
<p>本來，犯罪之在今日，已經成了嚴重的社會病態之一。跟着社會的貧乏，階級的懸殊，犯罪的數量，也就必然地日益加多起來。至於在犯罪學上說來，犯罪的種類有分「客觀的」，「主觀的」二種。而犯人亦分有「本能的」（先天的）犯人，「久慣的」（這裏又分「職業的」與「偶然的慣犯」兩種）與「偶犯」三種。</p>
<p>講到文明各國的重視敎化監犯，據我們所知道的，大多的治療方法分有！「分格制」與「分級制」二種·前者旨在隔斷囚犯互相學習爲惡的機會：後者對初犯者先嘗較苦生活爲第一級，繼則共同工作，最後爲自由的一級……</p>
<p>然而，在今日本市第二監獄當局的「重視」敎化監犯，却以「宣傳佛敎」着手，這不能不使入失望的了。宗敎——佛敎，之在今日，果然被這樣「重視」而利用着，有名的什麽「時輪金剛法會」，「消災大會」等，都是他們的傑作。所以，由於他們的「宗旨」他們的「宏願」，那末，所謂「法師居士」的對監犯們的「宣傳佛敎」，「感化心理」，其結果是可想而知的了！</p>
<p>本來，誰都不會吾認的吧，一般犯罪的主要原因，與犯罪數量的增加，是與社會的客觀環境有着不可分離的關係的。某社會學家據其研究的結果說：「竊犯的額數與麵包的漲價，是一慣地保持着正比例的」！可不是嗎？一個扒竊犯打牢裏出來只一星期，終於又操着「三只手」的舊業而被關進了牢，原因是——找不得職業，吃不到飯。這還是不多幾天前的事。</p>
<p>所以我們若要「敎化監犯」，「戚化心理」，終該先正「視」着現實的根本問題才是！所有好聽的空洞的言詞與方法，終不能持久的吧？</p>

<p>— 祝康</p>
<p>「胡桐花啊！」她一看到胡桐花就想起了前天和昨天的事。多情的台吉（註），是那樣的熱誠的愛她，他背着王公跑出來和她幽會。「他懂得女孩子的心，知道女孩子所需要的是什麽？合吉！我的命性根子！」從昨天她就這麽想過了！</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>「怎麽還不來？他說他不會忘記我！」</p>
<p>薩頓科河跟陽光私語着，拜達諾勒金面向着河水，又興興緻緻的唱起來：</p>
<p>長流水淸又淸，</p>
<p>小奴說話哥哥聽，</p>
<p>從今以後伴到老，</p>
<p>要是變心瞎眼睛，</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>台吉騎着馬跟另外兩個人走來，拜達諾勒金老遠就向台吉打招呼。走到跟前台吉下馬了，那兩個人是矮矮的，她沒顧得打量那倆人就去摟抱台吉，可是台吉不理她。她這才失望的去望那倆人：一個是四十多歲的漢子，權子挺兇，不用費思索她就記得在五天前她見過他，不是我們本國人，在魯賽瑞山下還照過像，找好多人打聽路途，往喀畢托怎麽走？往都坎那怎麽走，他都記在書本上。那一個却是女的，漂漂亮亮的年輕的女子，不用說也是××人，緊跟着台吉，那股扭扭捏捏的勁兒，簡直呌拜達諾勒金發火！</p>
<p>「過河往東是什麽地方？」那人問台吉</p>
<p>「特布肯次平原，那里還有鹽湖。」台吉一邊說一邊指着遠處。</p>
<p>拜達諾勒金氣忿極了，嫉妒的火燄在她渾身燃燒。台吉依然喜笑滿面的跨上馬匹，伴着那兩個人向北走去。</p>
<p>（註）台吉卽王公的兒子。</p>

<p>— 石風</p>
<p>今年的春天，是個「倒春寒，」眼看三月就過去五六天了，棉衣服還沒法往下脫，風尖溜溜地往袖統里鑽，像一條光滑的老鼠似的，簡直全身都在呌他爬遍了。一到黃昏，天更顯得寂冷，街道上變得有些荒凉的樣子，整個的小城陷在恐怖的情形下了。一片片的房子，一棵棵的樹木，都寂寞地啜泣着。</p>
<p>金濟之好像沒有力氣似地呵了一口氣，放下担子，向四周望望，就又嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>怎麽辦呢？眼看天就黑了，往哪里去呢？</p>
<p>早晨他從一家破廟里走出來，就轉到一條條的街巷，希望在前面領導着他，一羣小孩子也跟着一條供人玩弄的猴似的尾隨着。終於，他檢了一個地方，支撐起架子來，把小銅鑼鼓敲了一下，一羣學生裝的小孩子擁過來。他用鼓棰在人羣前面畫了一個圈子，然後又向畫面上指畫着，沙啞的嗓子說道：</p>
<p>—往里看：有張作霖大戰吳佩孚，十九路軍大戰東洋人，……還有這個蔣總司令出兵北伐……</p>
<p>說着，眼睛向四周看了一下，見沒有什麽妨礙的人，就把前面的幾張落下去，一張畫着幾個裸體女人的畫露出半截來：</p>
<p>—唉，這一張呌作摘葡萄，帶變的，看這個小孩…還有個大姑娘，還有一個老媽媽，……</p>
<p>落下這一張去，又一張新的出來了：是用木頭雕成的，兩個人，看去像一對老夫妻，在摟抱着，他把綫一拉一鬆的時候，兩個人就親密的親起嘴來了。孩子們哈哈地大笑着。於是他更高興地用鼓棰往畫上敲了敲，高興的神氣，說：</p>
<p>—這不算希奇，希奇的在里頭，把這綫一拉，里頭就有好玩藝看了！……誰看，誰看，……</p>
<p>他把鼓棰敲着每個玻璃窗，眼睛直勾勾地望着，希望五個地位馬上有人佔了，然後，再來第二次。然而，等了兩三分鐘的光景，只有兩個小孩子坐上看了，還空三個，他不好這樣開下去的。就只好親自出馬來拉了，因爲根據他過去的經騐來說，有許多人是想看而不好意思看的，更何况在這街頭，離他們的家庭非常近，如果正看着被他們的父兄看見一定不好說話的。可是這種人只要用手一拉，就坐過來了。他就近拉着兩個靑年人說：—這位大哥，作個揖，……帮塲，好的都在里邊哩，站在這里冷盍盍的，坐下看，坐下看……</p>
<p>兩個人你看看我，我看看你笑了一笑，就坐下去了。他也不好再等，就唱着小曲子，一張張的拉下去，小孩子大聲地驚嘆着里面的戰爭的景緻，靑年人都希望快些拉完第二張，第三張，……快些到末後的兩張，注意力就不在這上頭了。他想着：快一點，快一點。這時，兩位十五六歲的小姑娘來了，坐下來，兩個人並着頭看一個位子的。……你說這多糟，眞的，沒法往下演了：有女孩子怎麽好看呢？……兩個靑年人却更加有趣味的吵着往下演，過去「蔣總司令出兵北伐」就是「葡萄園」了，怎麽辦呢？他只好向女孩子哀求呌她們離開，她們又那樣固執，偏要看一下！</p>
<p>演呀，呌她看下去！可不要臉紅！</p>
<p>靑年人嘻笑着。女孩子不動聲色地伏着看。於是他演下去了。……在要變的時候，他很担心，又被催促着，只好把那個帶鈴的板子一拍，里面的畫就變了。這一變，兩個靑年哈哈地笑起來，小孩子也吵着，女孩子却憤怒地駡着離開了！她只好苦笑着，陪不是，接着玩下去！</p>
<p>接二連三地，他得到了些錢。上午，飯吃的飽了些。但是，下午到哪里哪里沒有人看，許多小孩子呌着跳着的往家里要錢去，出來的時候總不會和去時一樣：有的撅着嘴，甚至倘着淚。</p>
<p>眼看天黑了。往那里去呢。他呵了口氣，望着暮色漸漸加濃，就往昨夜住的那處廟里走去！</p>
<h3 id="c164">馬鞍山下的故事 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 巖</p>
<p>「桃三哥被人捉去了！」和桃三哥一同在田塲上工作的小癩子奔回來告訴桃三嫂。</p>
<p>太陽剛巧當頂，桃三嫂提着飯籃預備到田塲去，就在田岸碰着小癩子的報告。這報告彷彿是一枝利箭，貫穿了桃三嫂的心，跌倒在田岸上。頓時四鄰的人都圍了上來，等到桃三嫂醒來的時候，馬鞍山下的人幾乎都在這里了。大家吵着鬧着猜測桃三哥被捕的原因。</p>
<p>「好了，人醒來了。」湯老頭彷彿排解糾紛似的推開了衆人走近桃三嫂的面前。他是馬鞍山下的長者，雖然他們並沒有推選鄉長，鎭長的名目，但是湯老頭說幾句話還是比較有力量的。他席地坐了，推着小癩子說：「倒底是那一回事？慢慢地說。」</p>
<p>小癩子是馬鞍山下人家的公僕，在農忙的時候，他輪天帮着工作，他的酬報就是吃飽肚子睡覺。他有的是氣力，他拍過胸脯說：二三十個人眞不在我眼裏！但是他覺得今天的事是太出乎意外的，他盯着桃三嫂蒼白的臉囁喘着說：</p>
<p>「今天是桃三哥高興，我們分了田岸做活。起初我只是有二個過路人向桃三哥招呼，但是沒有說得幾句話，他們扭上了…就那樣碰去了…」</p>
<p>小癩子漲紅了臉，彷彿造着一個故事那樣吃力的樣子。小癩子本來喜歡拉七拉八講故事的，有幾個漢子瞧着就笑了出來。但是湯老頭用旱烟袋打着小癩子的脚腂說：</p>
<p>「你兩條腿放到什麽地方去了？不許扯謊，說明白了好辦事！」</p>
<p>望着湯老頭綳緊着的臉，小癩子顯得更慌張了。但是他遲疑着的時候，湯老頭的旱烟袋在他脚腂上作第二次示威了。雖然再笨重的棒子他可以咬緊牙根受幾下，他却怕那張綳緊着的面孔，終於一個孩子那樣發急地喊了出來：</p>
<p>「我剛拉下褲子拉矢呢！」</p>
<p>圍着的人轟雷似的笑了起來，桃三嫂蒼白的臉上也浮上了哭意，湯老頭用旱烟袋又拍了一下小癩子的屁股，要他老婆扶了桃三嫂到屋裏去，胸有成竹的吩咐大家去做活，他跟着到桃三嫂屋裏</p>
<p>桃三嫂沒有心緒吃飯，湯老頭帮着收拾了，就看着湯老頭在屋子裏來回地　着。沒有一柱香的時候，地保阿興像一個小偷似的　了進來，見了湯老頭他怔着了，但是湯老頭冲着他說：「阿興，你做得好事！」</p>
<p>「我正來報訊呢。」阿興諂媚地笑着：「張財主剛才差人把桃三哥捉去了，說是桃三哥還淸五斗陳租…」</p>
<p>湯老頭把旱烟袋連連打着地脚，彷彿地脚就是他的仇人似的，「我湯老頭也欠着他的租，爲什麽不把我捉去？哼，你們做得好事！我老婆年紀大了，沒有桃三嫂生得好看！」</p>
<p>湯老頭說着發了急，一尊門神似的對着阿興，火一樣的目光射着他，把旱烟袋架在他頭頸里說：</p>
<p>「阿興你拿了張財主多少錢？你是吃馬鞍山飯的，你娶不着桃三嫂做媳婦兒，就想出這種刻毒的計來，我湯老頭拼着這把年紀，看你在馬鞍山下還有飯吃！」（未完）</p>

<p>— 之爾</p>
<p>吳村先生最好的「自我批判」是這麼兩名話：「愛之欲其生，懸之欲其死」。「吳村之流。）萬秋兄不在共內—這是有舊文可抄；故特抄之—之爾）現在可算是惡我的了）。「你瞧」：述到我答應「以朋友的交誼來帮忙」的時候，稱之爲「兄」，而在述到以後因爲沒有帮他忙，便出以惡聲，稱之以「狗」，稱之以「之雨流」。這樣，吳村先生的「正義惑」難道還不够顯明嗎？</p>
<p>雖然，這也是有師承的。例如自己要做替主守門的典韋了，便不惜捧我爲「當先鋒」的「廖化」，而惑到被剝了狗皮的「够苦」，便斥之爲「無賴」覺得「無賴　還是「狗」的對頭，於是爲迷人耳目起見，便先發制人稱人爲「狗」了。如吳村先生者，原祇能學之「老手法」而已。「高明」的方法是沒有的。</p>
<p>「要是××不服，我倒希望他辦個導演事校好讓我來拜他做老頭子」。</p>
<p>「老頭子」爲何物，這個祇有「吳村之流」是饅懂得的。至於「導演學校」，則好像「戲劇前輩向培良也已經說過，要「反」要「吼」請在舞臺上拿出成績來。</p>

The mountains of Shanxi Province are continuous and interconnected, and the bandits are taking advantage of this to flee and cause disturbances. The剿 [suppress] bandit army is currently advancing in multiple directions to剿 [suppress] them. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: According to a certain source, the communists in Shanxi Province are facing difficulties due to a shortage of military funds and are being heavily suppressed, making it difficult for them to develop in the short term. Xu Haidong has already led over a thousand bandits with the intention of disturbing northern Shanxi. (27th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Disembarked at Changxindian to Review Troops, Issued Written Statement After Arriving in Beiping</p>
<p>Beiping: Song Zheyuan returned to Beiping from Baoding this afternoon. According to reports, he originally decided to go to Baoding to preside over the county magistrate examination. He originally planned to inspect the counties in southern Hebei, but due to the busy affairs of the provincial government and the inspection of the security forces and police, he stopped. He specially sent Men Zhizhong as a representative to Gaoyang, Renqiu, and Li County to assess the administrative affairs of various counties. He did not go elsewhere while in Baoding. After resting briefly after returning to Beiping, he plans to travel to Tianjin. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Song Zheyuan, accompanied by Men Zhizhong, Zhang Yunrong, Pan Yugui, and others, departed from Baoding by special train at 9:25 AM on the 27th to come to Beiping.

They departed from Changxindian at 1:10 PM and arrived in Beiping at 2:00 PM. Song stated that the examinations for the county magistrates of Hebei and Chahar have been completed. After the county magistrates reported on the administrative situation of each county, he already knew the general outline. He originally planned to inspect the counties to understand the actual situation, but he could not spare the time due to busy affairs, so he sent Men Zhizhong to inspect Gaoyang, Renqiu, and other counties. When there is an opportunity in the future, he will go to the counties for detailed inspections. He will attend the dinner hosted by American Ambassador Johnson on the evening of the 28th and then go to Tianjin on the 29th to visit relatives. The rumor that he took a car to Tianjin while in Baoding is not accurate. Men Zhizhong got off the train at Changxindian to inspect the highway and the Yongding River, and he is scheduled to return to Beiping tonight. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: After arriving in Beiping, Song Zheyuan issued a written statement saying that he decided to go to Baoding to examine the third batch of county magistrates. The methods are the same as the first two batches. There have been some reforms in local affairs: (1) The public security sections of the counties have been abolished and replaced with police officers, following the methods of Chahar Province. The security forces in the counties have also been reorganized to eliminate the weak and retain the strong. (2) The Pingda Automobile Road is under construction, and 200,000 yuan has been raised to prepare for the construction of 2,000 li of highways in the spring.

<h3 id="e8">Hebei East Smuggled Goods Transported to Tianjin, Customs Suffers Heavy Losses <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>New Anti-Smuggling Law Difficult to Achieve Results</p>
<p>Tianjin: According to customs sources, the coastal tax cards set up by the pseudo-Hebei East government have been renamed inspection stations to avoid strong accusations of destroying China's tariff system, and only collect one-quarter of the North China tariff on smuggled goods. Eight or nine ships of smuggled goods arrive at Beidaihe, Luanchang, and Haikou every day, and they all pay taxes at the pseudo tax cards. The customs is now making every effort to request the railway to provide concrete assistance and issue a notice to all money stations along the route to combat smuggling. Xu Liya, the chief tax officer of the Tianjin Customs, visited Chen Juesheng, the director of the Beining Bureau, on the 27th to discuss the matter. According to a customs investigation, every day Hebei East smuggled goods are transported to Tianjin, just sand and bran amount to 10,000 to 15,000 packages, not to mention rayon and woolen cloth. The Customs loses 10,000 yuan in taxes every day. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: According to a Tianjin customs official, it is still uncertain whether the new anti-smuggling law in North China will be effective after its implementation. If it proves ineffective in the future, it will be improved. The transportation of goods from Tianjin to the mainland is a matter of anti-smuggling in the mainland. In the past, it was the responsibility of the Changguan. After the Changguan was abolished, anti-smuggling was abandoned, which made smuggling unscrupulous. The Customs is limited by its authority and cannot interfere. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The Inspector General of Customs, Meierhe, will fly to Tianjin to discuss anti-smuggling measures with all relevant parties and inspect the smuggling situation. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Someone familiar with the North China tariff situation said that smuggled goods are now coming like a tide, and the Hebei East problem is difficult to resolve in a short time. No matter what kind of anti-smuggling law, it is difficult to use it as desired under the pressure of external forces. If the Ministry of Finance can endure the pain for a while and exempt foreign goods from tariffs for three months, then the import of foreign goods will be enthusiastic and the value will inevitably plummet. Smugglers will have no profit to be made, and the group will inevitably disintegrate. Then, re-promulgate a new law to make it effective. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: On the 27th, a large amount of rayon and sugar were transported to the Tianjin East Station and the Jinpu West Station. Some Japanese used cars to pick them up and transport them into a certain concession, and customs officers could not stop them. (27th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e16">Turkey Demands Restoration of Military Installations in Straits <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Turkey recently officially notified the League of Nations, as a member of the League of Nations Administrative Council, that it demands the abrogation of a portion of the Treaty of Lausanne and the restoration of military installations in the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits. This is not only a reaction to Germany's abrogation of the Locarno Pact, but also has its own inherent reasons.</p>
<p>The Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits are located between the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea and are militarily important. Westward, they can attack the Russian gateway to the Black Sea, and Russia can also use them to move south into the Mediterranean Sea to cut off British, French, and Italian communications with the East. Therefore, since the end of the 18th century, the European powers have almost always targeted this area in their competition in the Near East. After World War I, Turkey was restricted by the Treaty of Sevres and had to open the area as an international co-management zone. Then, the Turkish revolution rose up, and the Greco-Turkish War broke out. Britain used Greece as a tool to attack Turkey, but it was defeated by the Turkish army. When the Treaty of Lausanne was signed in July 1923, Turkey not only recovered some of the lost territories in the Treaty of Sevres, but also canceled the international co-management of the two straits, but still stipulated that Turkey could not set up military installations there. Although Turkey reluctantly accepted this at the time, it has always sought to abolish this provision in order to eliminate the last traces of unequal treaties. In recent years, in addition to being stimulated by the expansion of military installations by various countries around the world, Turkish Foreign Minister Rüşdü Aras proposed to reorganize the military installations in the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits at the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting in April last year, and Romania, Greece, and Yugoslavia also agreed to provide assistance, but it was not passed because it was not what Britain wanted to hear. When the Italo-Ethiopian War broke out and the Mediterranean situation became tense, Britain asked the countries along the Mediterranean coast for naval cooperation, and Turkey was also among them. Therefore, it planned to re-propose the old matter, but because Germany had already demanded to re-fortify the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland at the time, it was deeply afraid that proposing it at this time would easily be used as an excuse for Germany to abrogate the treaty, so it temporarily shelved the case. Now that Germany has unilaterally abrogated the treaty, Turkey has resolutely reiterated its previous request.</p>
<p>From the above, Turkey's direct role in this request is to eliminate the last traces of unequal treaties and to establish its position as the leader of the Balkan League. However, its indirect role also seems to be to prevent anti-Soviets from extending their power from the western Mediterranean coast to threaten the Soviet Union. The Soviet-Turkish friendship is harmonious, and the Soviet Union's recent agricultural, mining, and industrial construction in the Black Sea coast is quite extensive. Relying only on the protection of its Black Sea Fleet may not be safe enough. The realization of Turkey's request would be tantamount to giving the east coast of the Black Sea a barrier, preventing the anti-Soviet navy from driving straight in and adding a layer of protection to the Soviet Union's construction. Therefore, whether this request can be granted by the powers is a question worthy of attention.</p>

<p>Nanjing: Ma Yinchu, Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan, said in his review report on the issuance of 15 million yuan of Sichuan Province Rehabilitation Public Bonds at the plenary session on the 27th that although the Sichuan Province Rehabilitation and Construction Public Bonds issued by the central government in the past totaled 70 million yuan, 40 million yuan of which was used to repay old debts, 22 million yuan was used for rehabilitation and construction, and only 8 million yuan was actually used for bandit suppression military needs. Now, because the bandit suppression military affairs urgently need to be completed, another 15 million yuan of Sichuan Province Rehabilitation Public Bonds will be issued, which can be mortgaged at a 70% discount, and it is estimated that 10.05 million yuan in cash can be obtained. According to the estimate of the Ministry of Finance, this amount is sufficient to cover the bandit suppression military expenses in Sichuan Province before the end of this year. Wu Jingxiong, Chairman of the Legislative Committee, also reported on the review process of the county judicial office organization case, saying that the county magistrate兼 [concurrently manages] justice is indeed a畸形 [abnormal] system that has long been criticized by the world. After the promulgation and implementation of the Court Organization Law, it was originally expected that this 畸形 [abnormal] system would be eliminated in one fell swoop, but due to financial and personnel relations, most counties could not universally establish courts, so that county justice was still 兼 [concurrently] managed by the county magistrate. In this process, county judicial offices are temporarily established in counties that have not established courts to determine the principle of judicial independence and cultivate the initial foundation for the establishment of courts in the future. Although the colleagues know that this transitional method is not the true spirit of implementing the Court Organization Law, it seems to be an improvement compared to the county magistrate 兼 [concurrently] managing justice, and it is only stipulated that the implementation period is three years. Within three years, the two judicial administration and legislative institutions are still requested to properly plan judicial funding and improve the organization of the courts.

<p>Nanjing: The Sichuan Rehabilitation Public Bonds will continue to be issued for 15 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%, and will be liquidated in the 40th year of the Republic of China. It is not easy to sell at once, and they are negotiating with the banking community to mortgage them. According to a 70% discount, 10.05 million yuan in cash can be obtained. Because the Sichuan bandit suppression expenses require one million yuan per month, it can be used for one year. Liu Hangchen, Director of the Sichuan Department of Finance, arrived in Beijing on the 27th specifically for this matter. It is heard that he will first negotiate with the Central Bank to lend 2 million yuan to meet the needs. Other mortgage loan methods are still in progress and have not been finalized.

<p>Delegates and Quotas Continue to Seek Instructions from the Central Government, and It Is Expected That Three Meetings Will Be Held Next Week to Begin Reviewing the Articles</p>
<p>Nanjing: The two committees of the Legislative Yuan drafting the National Assembly Organization Law and the Representative Election Law held a meeting on the 27th. According to Chairman Fu Bingchang, today they did not discuss the entire articles of the two organization laws, but only discussed the points of doubt that arose when the two committees drafted the first drafts of the two laws, studied them, and decided to submit them to the President of the Yuan for instructions from the Central Government. The most important point is the quota of representatives. Therefore, after today's meeting, the proposed allocation figures of the National Assembly annex and the opinions put forward by the Mongolian-Tibetan, military, and overseas Chinese parties were all submitted to the President of the Yuan for instructions from the Central Standing Committee. After the instructions arrive at the Yuan, another meeting of the members will be convened next week. It is reported that the total amount of figures allocated in the annex is 1,200, according to the principles promulgated by the Central Government, except for 30 military representatives, 690 are for regional elections, 380 are for professional elections, and the rest are allocated to overseas Chinese affairs and Mongolian-Tibetan border areas. The highest quota for elections in each province and region is 45, such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Sichuan, and other provinces, and the lowest quota is 10, such as Northeast and Xikang regions. After the Xikang Office in Beijing submitted a request through the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission to include Xikang as a separate province and region, it has been included as a separate province and region at today's meeting. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The 24-member committee of the Legislative Yuan held the second meeting in the afternoon of the 27th. Chairman Fu Bingchang first had Lin Bin report on the drafting process of the first drafts of the two National Assembly cases, and on the principles promulgated by the Central Government, which were considered to need to continue to seek instructions from the Central Government. Then, the members resolved the points that Lin said should be requested from the Central Government in the meeting. Other points, such as the table of allocation of representative quotas, the boundaries of industrial groups, and whether the candidates recommended by each electoral district can be exempted from the scrutiny procedures by the provincial government, still need to continue to seek instructions from the Central Government because they are of great importance. The meeting adjourned at half past five. After the meeting, Fu Bingchang said that the most intense debate among the members at the meeting on the 27th was still the issue of the allocation of representative quotas. It is now planned to draft a submission on the points that should be requested from the Central Government, submit it to President Sun and Vice President Ye, and forward it to the Central Government for approval. After receiving the reply, it is planned to convene the third meeting next week to begin reviewing the articles of the two laws. It is also heard that among the table of allocation of representative quotas decided at the meeting on the 27th, ten representatives should be produced for regional elections. In addition, for every 800,000 people, one representative will be added, but the maximum is 45. This method can not only prevent provinces and cities with smaller populations from being left out, but also prevent provinces and cities with larger populations from having too many representatives in the meeting. It is learned that the provinces and cities that can produce the maximum number of representatives are Su, Chuan, Yue, Yu, Lu, and other provinces, while Xikang can produce ten representatives.

<p>London. British Foreign Secretary Eden held an important meeting with German Ambassador Ribbentrop today, lasting 45 minutes. Ribbentrop asked Eden to explain that in his speech in the House of Commons yesterday, the chiefs of staff of Britain and France are now in consultation regarding the obligations of the Locarno Treaty. It is said that Eden replied that the talks have not yet begun, but seem likely to begin within ten days. Ribbentrop continued to ask for a clearer explanation of the framework under which the talks will proceed. If Britain still considers itself bound by the Locarno Treaty, then Britain also has an obligation to defend Germany's borders from violation, not only the borders of France and Belgium. It is expected that Eden will reply that Britain's obligations as a guarantor only apply to France and Belgium, because Germany has abolished the Locarno Treaty. Both Eden and Ribbentrop believe that Hitler's response to the memorandum of the four countries, Britain, France, Belgium, and Italy, should not be discussed at present. Both believe that the gap between France and Germany can be bridged, so they have decided that negotiations on this issue are best postponed until after the French general election and will begin in mid-May. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London. German representative Ribbentrop formally raised reservations with Foreign Secretary Eden at noon today regarding the ongoing talks between the British, French, and Belgian general staffs. British officials claimed that Ribbentrop had asked Foreign Secretary Eden about the agreement that could be reached between the British and French general staffs, and the adverse impact this agreement could have on future negotiations. Eden gave a detailed explanation. Ribbentrop completed his mission and boarded a plane at 3 PM today to return to Berlin to report to Head of State Hitler. Once the German government has completed its response to the Locarno Treaty, he will return here. (27th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>London – Foreign Secretary Eden, at 3:45 PM today, attended the House of Commons and delivered an important speech on the government's foreign policy. The speech lasted for over an hour. The venue was packed, with every seat in the diplomatic corps section filled. The ambassadors from France, Germany, Belgium, and Poland, the U.S. Chief Representative to the Naval Conference, Davis, and ministers from other countries all attended to listen. The grand occasion was rarely seen. Foreign Secretary Eden stated, "The various obligations contained in the Locarno Pact are of great practical significance. As a guarantor of the pact, we are bound by its provisions. Every Foreign Secretary of Britain has adhered to the treaties signed by Britain. Now that I am in charge of foreign affairs, I would rather break my own teeth than violate the treaties. There is no doubt about this." (Havas dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>London – British Foreign Secretary Eden, while debating foreign policy in the House of Commons today, delivered a speech requesting the entire House, regardless of party affiliation, to establish a unified national policy and provide common assistance to maintain peace, strengthen the League of Nations, and uphold the dignity of treaties, promising to be consistent and unremitting in their efforts to construct a future that can clear away the existing clouds of sorrow and misery from the current state of troubles and anxieties. Eden's warning was: "We know our responsibilities and are prepared to proceed, but what we consider most important is that we must resolutely seek peace based on a durable foundation. If we want to achieve this goal, we must have the assistance of all sectors of the country."</p>
<p>At the beginning of his speech, Eden stated that his remarks today were not directed at foreign countries but at the British people. He would speak frankly about international events, without concealment, so that the British people could understand the current situation and its difficulties through clear and accurate language. The people must distinguish between national emotions and obligations that are beneficial or detrimental to the nation. The provision in the Treaty of Versailles that the Rhineland should never be garrisoned was the most important factor in France's decision to abandon its demand that the Rhineland be separated from Germany.</p>
<p>Eden then traced the history of the demilitarized zone to ensure France's security and the process by which Germany failed to comply with the procedures stipulated in the freely negotiated treaties. He stated that Germany referred to the Treaty of Versailles as a treaty imposed under duress, in which the Germans had no say. However, no one had ever accused the Locarno Pact of being concluded under duress. If Germany wanted to revise the Locarno Pact, it could engage in negotiations. The issue of whether the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty conflicted with the Locarno Pact should be resolved according to the methods stipulated in the latter. If the Hague Tribunal was deemed inappropriate, the Franco-German arbitration treaty clearly stipulated that legal issues could also be submitted to the Permanent Conciliation Commission. Even those in Britain who believed Germany had sufficient reasons abhorred Germany's actions of using force instead of reason.</p>
<p>Eden then spoke about Britain's position and read out Article 4 of the Locarno Pact, stating that Britain was not an arbiter but a guarantor with real obligations. He wished to explain to the House that he was not prepared to be the first Foreign Secretary to go back on his word. At the same time, according to Article 7 of the Locarno Pact, the British government had an obligation to seek reconciliation and understanding through peaceful means. The current proposal of the four countries aimed at communicating opinions before negotiations. This was not an ultimatum, nor was it an order to be accepted by force. If the international military force was a difficult point and the German government had other alternative suggestions, the British government could prepare to consider them with other countries. However, it was essential to understand that if the German side did not make constructive contributions, the work aimed solely at starting negotiations would be impossible to proceed.</p>
<p>Eden continued, stating that Britain's contribution to the security of France and Belgium had been included in the four-nation proposal, and explained the arrangements for general staff talks. He said that the general staff talks now were very different from those before 1914. In the past, the talks were not accompanied by political understandings, so their significance was not limited. However, the talks now were only limited to the intentions already stated in the political agreement. Some people were now advocating that Britain must avoid various European disputes. It should be known that the security of the territories of France and Belgium must be maintained, and that the troops of other countries must not be allowed to cross their borders. This was a matter of great concern to Britain. The general staff talks only applied to cases of unprovoked aggression. He hoped that actions such as unprovoked aggression, which were conditions for the general staff talks, would never occur. However, he was convinced that once Britain's position was clearly announced, such incidents would not occur.</p>
<p>Regarding the responsibilities that Britain could join as part of the final solution, the guarantees between Western European countries should be reciprocal. Britain would give guarantees to others and would also receive guarantees from others. Security would be shared. All signatories of the Locarno Pact, including Germany, could join this new guarantee.</p>
<p>Eden continued, speaking about the guarantees that Germany and France would receive in the event of a failure to reconcile. He said that apart from the European part involved in the obligations of the Locarno Pact, Britain's guarantee was the same as that of other members of the League of Nations. As for the scope involved in the Locarno Pact, Britain did not have new restrictions but only had ways to more effectively fulfill existing restrictions. He had no regrets about the various proposals contained in the White Paper. The current situation was serious, rarely seen since the war. Few people in Britain understood the great relationship between the demilitarized zone and some parts of Europe. After the publication of the White Paper, any steps that could lead to war were unlikely to take place. Comparing the risk of war with the White Paper, he was convinced that the world would recognize that the White Paper had its own value. The world attached great importance to new negotiations, but new negotiations would only be possible if Germany made a contribution. Germany had not yet made any contribution, only Hitler had committed to not increasing the number of troops in the Rhineland. This was still not enough. If Germany promised not to build defensive works in the Rhineland during the negotiations, it might be helpful. However, from what he had heard, Germany could not even give this commitment.</p>
<p>Eden concluded by saying that the British government had three objectives: eliminating the scourge of war, creating a situation in which new negotiations could be held, and promoting the success of new negotiations, so as to strengthen collective security and facilitate Germany's re-entry into the League of Nations, and to enable larger negotiations on the scope of economic and disarmament, which are essential for European peace, to be held in a more pleasant atmosphere. How will the opportunity to implement the above procedure be? It will depend on Hitler's suggestions next week. He believed that Hitler had understood the efforts made by the British government. He knew that Hitler must know how eagerly Europe expected his proposals. As far as Britain was concerned, we could tell Hitler that we would treat his suggestions with a broad mind and sincere desire, in order to make good use of his suggestions and achieve lasting peace in Europe. There was one more condition for success, namely, a more peaceful atmosphere. The time for crucial international negotiations had just begun. He believed that there were several points that any British Foreign Secretary had to recognize. Britain was not bound by the various policies of France or Germany. What was Britain's policy? It was the League of Nations Covenant and its obligations as a member of the League of Nations. We knew our obligations and were prepared to fulfill them. Eden concluded as follows: "I want to tell France, 'If you are not prepared to deal with the difficult problems that still separate you and Germany with a broad mind, then we will not be able to guarantee peace.' I also want to tell Germany, 'If you are not prepared to make contributions to dispel the European anxiety you have created, how can we hope to participate in any negotiations with success?' The British people, who have peace as their sole purpose, a European solution as their sole desire, and the support of the League of Nations as their sole political proposition, will judge other countries on the spirit and scope of this cooperation."

<p>London – The debate was opened today by Foreign Secretary Eden. Eden spoke at great length, including the statement that he did not want to be the first Foreign Secretary to recognize Britain's treaty obligations. After the Foreign Secretary finished speaking, Dalton spoke on behalf of the Labour Party, criticizing the details of the four-nation proposal, saying that a country that did not support a purely British-French military alliance would support the establishment of a strong organization for collective security formed by the League of Nations. Dalton strongly opposed the suggestion in the Locarno Agreement that the British and French army chiefs of staff jointly plan to defend the French border. George then made a preliminary statement in response. (Reuters dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>London – The House of Commons discussed foreign policy yesterday afternoon until 11:00 PM before adjourning. Churchill, the leader of the extreme right wing of the Conservative Party, and Major Attlee, the leader of the Labour opposition, both delivered speeches. The discussion was finally concluded by Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain. (Havas dispatch of the 27th)</p>
<p>London – In the House of Commons' debate on foreign policy today, Sinclair, a Liberal MP, spoke after Labour MP Dalton. He first condemned Germany's actions, but said, "What Germany has done is to remove the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles, which should have been removed long ago." Any treaty that is no longer appropriate should be revised by the League of Nations. Sinclair firmly condemned the plan in the draft Locarno Agreement for British and French troops to be stationed in the German Rhineland. He said that if the troops of the two countries were stationed in the same place, conflicts might occur. He also said that the British government should always faithfully abide by all the obligations contained in the League of Nations Covenant, but should strive to avoid military alliances. Nigel, an MP of the National Labour Party, said, "No one in France, when in power, would agree to a war of aggression, and Germany is a common danger to European countries. All the MPs present here should agree with this statement. Therefore, we should immediately conclude a practical agreement with France so that if France has difficulties before a final solution is reached in the current difficult situation, we can provide full assistance to it. However, it should be stated that this assistance can only be applied in Western Europe." (Havas dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>London – After Foreign Secretary Eden finished speaking in the House of Commons this afternoon, Dalton, the former Foreign Secretary, immediately stood up on behalf of the opposition Labour Party and criticized several points of the draft Locarno Agreement. He strongly criticized the provision in the first part of the draft that the 20-kilometer zone inside Germany, east of the Franco-Belgian border, should be assigned to the troops of Britain and Italy to guard, saying, "This suggestion is purely wishful thinking and is extremely absurd. The mutual assistance provisions of the Locarno Pact, as stated in the draft, should be jointly discussed by the general staffs of Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium, are also wishful thinking. As of now, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has been silent and contemptuous, which makes people feel that the British government is now abandoning the League of Nations, unwilling to seek rapprochement within the scope of the League of Nations, and wants to open up a new path to conclude a British-French alliance." Dalton then declared that what we Labour MPs support is not a British-French alliance, but a collective security system, and what we advocate is the Geneva Protocol of 1924. "If Germany refuses to participate in the collective security system, then other countries should also organize a peace system, even if Germany is not in it. Britain should make a clear declaration that Germany should not be allowed to attack Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, or Austria. If British words can be so frank and clear, then there will be no war in Europe." (Havas dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>London – Lloyd George, the former Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party, spoke in the House of Commons today after Nigel, an MP of the National Labour Party. He said that he was "captivated" by Foreign Secretary Eden's remarks, and that the draft Locarno Agreement, "in my view, is very dangerous, and Eden defended it in every way, with the most skillful rhetoric. I advocate that Germany must obtain equal rights, and I hope that the British government will give Germany a fair opportunity for any suggestions it may put forward, so that it can negotiate calmly." Lloyd George then questioned the government: "Will the mutual assistance measures discussed between the general staffs of the countries concerned be implemented when negotiations break down, or will they be implemented only when an unprovoked act of aggression occurs? This question is related to the lives of millions of young people. The above two levels are vastly different and cannot be confused. I now warn you, MPs, that the military alliance system previously caused the Great War of 1914. If you join the alliance in the future, the result will be a repeat of the past. Countries are now in this dangerous situation. French Foreign Minister Flandin gave a speech in the Chamber of Deputies last week, and all the MPs paid great attention when he mentioned this. Now Foreign Secretary Eden says that the talks between the general staffs of the countries concerned are only the implementation measures of the Locarno Pact, but this is not the case. In my view, these talks are exactly the same as the military alliances that caused the European War in the past."</p>
<p>Sir Chamberlain, the Conservative leader and former Foreign Secretary, then spoke, saying that among the declarations made in Parliament, Foreign Secretary Eden's declaration today was the best. The crux of the problem at this moment was not the long-standing feud between France and Germany, because the treaty obligations destroyed by Germany not only involved France but also affected Belgium. Chamberlain recalled Prime Minister Baldwin's words in March last year, that "Britain's border is not on the coast of Dover, but on the banks of the Rhine," saying that "at this moment, not only France and Belgium are in danger, but also Britain. Because in terms of Britain's security, the freedom and independence of France and Belgium are of great importance, even more so than at any time in the past. What is the most important issue in the future relationship between European countries? That is, Germany is allowed to maintain normal relations with its neighbors, and the country is abiding by the promises it has freely accepted, or whether these promises can only bind other countries, and Germany can discard them at any time, should be determined." Sir Chamberlain finally mentioned the suggestions of Chancellor Hitler, saying that although they were enough to make people feel relieved, "Unfortunately, words and deeds do not match." The 25-year peace plan was also purely wishful thinking, because Germany was also a signatory to the Kellogg-Briand Pact and could not use war as an instrument of national policy. (Havas dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>The former Foreign Secretary Chamberlain also declared that the real point of contention today was whether military victory or the rule of law would prevail in the future. If the credibility of treaties could not be restored, it would be impossible to conclude new treaties. Hitler had made various promises, but he had not seen any action to guarantee them. He had proposed a 25-year peace, but Germany was bound by the Kellogg Pact to never use war as an instrument of policy. Germany's statement that it was willing to return to the League of Nations was obviously a request to recover its colonies. Germany's recent anti-Semitism and glorification of war were major issues that should be resolved, not small issues such as the reoccupation of the Rhineland. If we do not learn a lesson, we will quickly see a new 1914.</p>
<p>Churchill then spoke, saying that the real problem was not the reoccupation of the Rhineland, but Germany's rearmament. Countries alarmed by Germany's military expansion should now conclude mutual assistance treaties under the League of Nations Covenant. Any measures that we are unwilling to impose on ourselves should not be imposed on Germany. The security of German territory should be guaranteed. Not only on the Rhineland issue, but also on the major issue of German rearmament, countries should collectively negotiate with Germany, and Germany must be asked to state its grievances. (Reuters dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>Attlee, a member of the opposition party, then spoke, praising the Foreign Secretary's handling of difficult negotiations and supporting his policy, saying that the Labour Party agreed to invite Germany to join the League of Nations, but Germany had now lost its credibility. Without its expression to abide by the treaties from now on, inviting it to join would be purely wishful thinking. Countries should now advocate that Germany should contribute to peace and security.</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain concluded the debate for the government, saying that we must now go through a long process before we can rely on the members of the League of Nations to cooperate in punishing aggressors. At the same time, we must think that the Locarno Agreement has strengthened the League of Nations. The Chancellor then mentioned George's question, that the treaty signed by the British and French chiefs of staff obliged Britain to cooperate with France in driving the German troops out of the Rhineland, saying, "There is no such thing." He then said that Germany had not yet contributed to restoring its credibility. What we want is for Germany to prove to other countries that it has a genuine desire to participate in the meeting to obtain a satisfactory solution. After the Chancellor finished speaking, the meeting was adjourned without a vote. (Reuters dispatch of the 26th)</p>

<p>London – It was announced here today that after Japan withdraws from the London Naval Treaty, the United States is temporarily unwilling to discuss the issue of fortifications in the Pacific. Britain had inquired with the United States for its opinion. The U.S. delegation replied that after Japan's withdrawal from the meeting, this issue could no longer be on the agenda. However, it is generally believed that if Japan can sign a new treaty in the future, the United States may still discuss the issue of fortifications. (National Telegram of the 26th)</p>
<p>London – Naval experts attending the meeting here today said that the goodwill and economic strength between naval powers can prevent wasteful naval competition. The newly established tripartite treaty between Britain, France, and the United States should eliminate international suspicion and reduce the risk of the sudden appearance of new types of warships. As for other effects, it all depends on the rationality of the international community. The Japanese representative stated today that although representatives of several countries spoke when signing the treaty, requesting Japan to abide by the terms of the new treaty, it is doubtful whether Japan is willing to abide by it. If Japan cannot agree to reduce the limit on the caliber of guns from 16 inches to 14 inches before New Year's Day next year, then the provision will be automatically canceled. (National Telegram of the 26th)</p>
<p>Washington – Well-informed sources here said today that the world's naval powers all know that naval competition is inevitable, but only a calm mind and agile diplomacy can avoid it. Because the newly established naval treaty between Britain, France, and the United States does not limit the number of warships, whether there will be competition in the future depends entirely on Japan's policy and the situation in Europe. If Japan is willing to limit its fleet and still maintain a ratio that is not much different from the current one, then dangerous competition may be avoided. Although Japan has stated that it should have equal rights with the British and American navies, it has not yet announced its intention to implement this right. Therefore, most of the international naval construction competition must depend on Japan's policy on this point. However, the policies of Germany and Italy also have a direct impact on the British and French navies. Italy may expand its fleet because British ships are stationed in the Mediterranean. As a result, naval competition will also arise. Currently, the United States has the largest fleet in the world, with a total of 342 warships, Britain has 303, Japan has 212, France has 209, Italy has 182, and Germany has 42. However, the U.S. fleet is very old. If only warships that meet the age requirements are considered, there are only 87, Britain has 146, Japan has 149, France has 144, Italy has 119, and Germany has 32. The United States has now determined a plan for expansion and replacement in order to remedy the situation. There are already 84 ships under construction that have been designated, and they will be built soon. At the same time, Britain also has 49 ships under construction, and Japan has 35. The U.S. construction program includes 3 aircraft carriers, 3 heavy cruisers, 9 light cruisers, 52 destroyers, and 16 submarines. A naval expert predicted that the United States would soon expand its naval bases among its territories in the Pacific in order to resist the impact of the treaty's restrictions on the construction of heavy cruisers. If naval ports are established on Samoa Island, Guam, and Alaska, and the facilities in Hawaii and the Philippines are expanded, then the value of all 20 heavy cruisers of the United States will be twice as much as it is now. Senior U.S. naval authorities also deeply feel the need for this in order to cope with the larger cruiser strength of Britain and Japan. Because Japan is compact and Britain has a dense network of military ports and many merchant ships, they are the wings of the navy. (National Telegram of the 26th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – On the morning of the 26th, Fujii, the acting ambassador to Britain, visited Councillor Craigie of the British Foreign Office and expressed the Japanese government's views on the submarine usage restriction proposal as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese government has no objection in principle to retaining Article 4 regarding submarine usage restrictions in the London Treaty.</p>
<p>However, the form of its retention should avoid establishing a new treaty or a similar form.</p>
<p>In the new treaty established this time, the provision on the use of submarines exists independently in the form of a protocol. This form does not meet the wishes of the Japanese government. Please reconsider and change its form. After 45 minutes, Acting Ambassador Fujii resigned. It is heard that the British government will reconsider the issue of the above form. (Domei News Agency dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Naval System Investigation Committee has been holding policy, organization reform, and budget sub-committee meetings for days to investigate data and review reform methods. As a result, the reform of the naval system is a necessary thing to implement. The various organizations within the current navy department have been greatly reduced in personnel and organizational expenses due to the influence of the Washington and London treaties, and most of the budget has been transferred to increasing warships and aviation troops, resulting in a one-sided phenomenon. However, when the naval treaty is eliminated at the beginning of 1937, it will be difficult to bear the major tasks of fulfilling national defense and strengthening combat effectiveness with the current content. Therefore, it is necessary to reorganize the organization of the Zhenshoufu Yaogangbu (various important locations for naval defense) within the department in order to achieve the purpose.

<p>Tokyo – Regarding the Changlingzi incident, as of the 27th,</p>
<p>According to information received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is known that Japanese and Soviet</p>
<p>troops have both withdrawn approximately five li, centered on their respective national borders,</p>
<p>and have gathered there to ease the confrontation,</p>
<p>temporarily calming the situation. Therefore, this incident is unlikely to escalate. As for the Soviet Union, since the February 26th Incident,</p>
<p>the fact that considerable troops have been moved to the Soviet-Manchurian border area</p>
<p>is true, and the Japanese side is paying close attention to this. (27th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Ambassador Ueta, stationed in Manchuria, reported the following to the First Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the Changlingzi incident: On the 25th, at 8:10 AM,</p>
<p>Lieutenant Kajiwara of the unit stationed in Yanji, along with four men, and Sergeant Ogura of the Hunshun Detachment with five men,</p>
<p>went to inspect the border area of Changlingzi, Hunshun County. They were suddenly</p>
<p>ambushed by eight members of the Changlingzi GPU. There was no warning beforehand. As a result, Lieutenant Kajiwara,</p>
<p>Second Lieutenant Fukushima, and Sergeant Ogura of the Hunshun Detachment all suffered injuries of varying degrees. As for First Class Medical Officer Minoda and Private First Class Yoshida,</p>
<p>their whereabouts are unknown. This incident, without any prior warning,</p>
<p>constitutes an illegal attack on Japanese officers and soldiers undergoing training on the Manchurian-Soviet border. The responsibility</p>
<p>lies with the Soviet side. The judgment of right and wrong is extremely clear.</p>
<p>The responsibility for this illegal act should be borne entirely by the Soviet GPU,</p>
<p>and so on. (27th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>Dalian – General Kenkichi Ueda, Commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, passed through Andong Station at 11:00 AM this morning en route to Manchuria. According to him,</p>
<p>the conflict between the Japanese and Soviet troops at Changlingzi is a local issue</p>
<p>and will not escalate. The established policy of resolving border disputes</p>
<p>will not be adversely affected in any way. (27th, China United Press)</p>
<p>Moscow – According to a report from Kulun, at 3:15 PM on March 24th,</p>
<p>a unit of Japanese-Manchukuo troops in three large trucks</p>
<p>attacked a Mongolian border guard outpost in the area of Lake Buurnuur in Mongolia. The attackers were reinforced by four more trucks</p>
<p>and immediately opened fire. The Mongolian outpost fought bravely and resisted,</p>
<p>forcing the invading troops to retreat back into Manchurian territory. The Mongolian border guards suffered no losses in this engagement. On the morning of March 25th,</p>
<p>two hundred Japanese-Manchukuo troops concentrated in the fishing village area two kilometers from the lake.</p>
<p>In the evening, they fired rifles and machine guns at the Mongolian outpost,</p>
<p>and simultaneously fired two cannons. The Mongolian border guards returned fire,</p>
<p>but due to the disparity in numbers between them and the Japanese-Manchukuo troops, they retreated under cover of darkness from that location</p>
<p>to the shallow waters of the lake seven kilometers from the Outer Mongolian border. On the dawn of March 26th, the Japanese-Manchukuo troops, seeing that the Mongolian outpost</p>
<p>had withdrawn, crossed the Khalkhyn Gol River and occupied the outpost</p>
<p>until 1:00 PM. They spotted a Mongolian plane in the conflict area</p>
<p>and began to retreat. Subsequently, the Japanese-Manchukuo troops crossed the river and returned to Manchurian territory. However, because the Japanese-Manchukuo troops were still concentrated in the area,</p>
<p>their attack on the Mongolian border guards could erupt at any time.</p>

<h3 id="e62">The Complexity of Japanese Politics: Observations from the Editor of an English Newspaper in Tokyo <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Los Angeles – Mr. Freitsch, the owner of the well-known English-language newspaper "Japan Advertiser"</p>
<p>published in Japan, has arrived in Los Angeles and stated that the Japanese military will control the government even more powerfully in the future.</p>
<p>The problems involved in the current Japanese political situation</p>
<p>are so complex that they cannot be understood by the United States. Only when a military faction advocating</p>
<p>leniency gains power will Japan's difficulties be effectively resolved. The recent disturbances in Japan are merely</p>
<p>a scene in a deeply rooted movement. This movement, since the September 18th Manchurian Incident,</p>
<p>has been ongoing and intensifying.</p>
<p>Although the army authorities have tried their best to conceal</p>
<p>the fact that there are differences of opinion within the army, the existence of rebels</p>
<p>has been undeniable for several years. The September 18th Incident</p>
<p>was, in fact, a mutiny by the Japanese army in Manchuria. Shigeru Honjo, who was then the commander of the Japanese army in Manchuria, could</p>
<p>be suspected for his inability to restrain his subordinates. At the time, the Army Minister and the Cabinet could have recalled Honjo,</p>
<p>but considering future events, the nation had to endorse</p>
<p>it. After the assassination of Tsuyoshi Inukai on May 15, 1932,</p>
<p>General Araki, a powerful figure in the nationalist faction, was appointed</p>
<p>as Army Minister. It was expected that he could restrain the dissatisfied</p>
<p>elements within the army. Although the mutinies in the Japanese army were limited to dissatisfied</p>
<p>young officers, this rebellion was actually encouraged by those within and outside the army.</p>
<p>Japanese law prohibits communism and often searches for</p>
<p>communists, but there are indeed numerous</p>
<p>groups that go beyond the scope of patriotism. Their primary platform</p>
<p>is to support the Emperor, while</p>
<p>other platforms have an anti-capitalist and socialist nature. These</p>
<p>young officers and patriotic group leaders do not want what</p>
<p>Europeans call a fascist system, but rather want a military</p>
<p>socialist regime. The Emperor's advisors are doing their</p>
<p>utmost to quell this radical movement, and as a result, the young officers</p>
<p>are assassinating politicians around the Emperor who advocate leniency.</p>
<p>Current and recent events may have caused a reaction,</p>
<p>making the masses aware of the lurking dangers. However, this</p>
<p>movement has spread widely, and even those in close contact with the Japanese government,</p>
<p>such as the Prime Minister himself, find it difficult to determine the impact of this reaction.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Freitsch, who has been in the United States for two months recuperating,</p>
<p>he is now preparing to return to Tokyo. (27th, Reuters)</p>

<h3 id="e70">Hunan-Guizhou-Yunnan Highway <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>—From Initial Construction to Improvement—</p>
<p>Guiyang Correspondence: Our country is vast in territory, and although there has been considerable progress in road construction in recent years thanks to the efforts of people in and out of government, according to a recent survey, the country has only more than 84,000 kilometers of highways. This is far from the one million miles (equivalent to 1.6 million kilometers) of crushed stone roads that Premier Sun Yat-sen envisioned in his "The International Development of China". It can be said that the southwestern provinces are located on the periphery, and transportation is obstructed. Not only have the natural resources not been developed, resulting in poverty, but also the Zhu-Mao communist bandits used the area as a refuge two years ago. Fortunately, the Central Army tracked them down and gradually eliminated them. At that time, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek realized the importance of developing transportation in the southwest, which was urgent. Therefore, he immediately telegraphed the Highway Department of the Military Council, ordering it to first rush the construction of the Hunan-Guizhou Highway, with the aim of gradually promoting it. Now that the Hunan-Guizhou Road has been completed, he ordered the continued construction of the Guizhou-Yunnan Highway, and the reorganization of the Guiyang-North section of the Sichuan-Guizhou Road, and the Guiyang-East section of the Hunan-Guizhou Road. Therefore, the engineering situation and construction plans of each road are briefly described below.</p>
<p>Route Survey</p>
<p>The Hunan Highway Bureau originally planned two routes, the Hunan-Guizhou route and the Hunan-Sichuan route. The Hunan-Guizhou route goes from Xiangtan, via Binqing, to Hongjiang, and then to Zhihuang. The Hunan-Sichuan route goes from Taoyuan, via Yuanling, around Baojing, and to Liye Si. The former is biased towards the southeast, and the latter is towards the northwest. Moreover, the routes pass through overlapping mountains, making construction even more difficult. Later, the Highway Department of the Military Council dispatched Chief Engineer Li Yu to personally survey the routes, and examine the agricultural, mining, industrial, and commercial conditions. After detailed research, he selected a more suitable route between the two, which is the current route from Changde, via Taoyuan, Yuanling, Chenxi, Zhijiang, directly to Huangxian. However, there are still two ferry crossings between Changde and Taoyuan, which are very inconvenient for travelers. Therefore, a new route was re-established along the east bank of the Yuan River to avoid them. Therefore, the route surveyed this time has many advantages compared to the original route.</p>
<p>Planning Process</p>
<p>After the route of the road was determined, the Highway Department of the Military Council immediately moved to Yuanling, and based on the determined route, conducted separate surveys and estimated the project budget, which required 2.1 million yuan. In addition to the 300,000 yuan approved by the Military Council, the remaining funds were borrowed by the Hunan Provincial Government from the Shanghai banking group for 1.8 million yuan using 3 million yuan of construction bonds. Once the funds were determined, the Hunan-Guizhou Highway Engineering Office was organized, and Yu Jichuan, the Director of the Hunan Construction Department, was appointed as the head. On the one hand, technical personnel were borrowed from Hunan and Zhejiang provinces to actively carry out the work. The entire line was divided into eight sections to start construction. From Dangde to Taoyuan was called the Detong Section, Taoyuan to Yuanling was called the Taoyuan Section, and the six sections above Yuanling were recorded in order by numbers. However, western Hunan is poor and the procurement and transportation of all materials and workers' food rice were extremely difficult. Therefore, an office was established in Changsha, and transfer stations were added along the line to provide supplies.</p>
<p>Engineering Progress</p>
<p>The Hunan-Guizhou Highway starts from Deshan in Changde and ends at Yuyu shop in Yuping, with a total length of 458 kilometers. Except for stone bridge and culvert contracts, the earthwork project was generally done by migrant workers who were given subsidies. Along the route, the county chiefs served as supervisors, responsible for managing the conscription of labor. At the same time, more than 10,000 people were mobilized, spread across the entire line, and carried out in order. Construction began at the end of April last year, and the entire project was completed at the end of August of the same year.</p>
<p>Guizhou-Yunnan Highway</p>
<p>Overview of Past and Present</p>
<p>From Guiyang via Qingzhen, Pingba to Anshun, the journey is about 90 kilometers. The roadbed and pavement have been built and opened to traffic. From Anshun to Huangguoshu, it is about 55 kilometers. The roadbed has been completed, but most of the pavement is damaged. A section near Huangguoshu has a very steep slope, which cannot be traveled without major repairs. From Huangguoshu via Yongning Annan to Panxian, the total length is 250 kilometers. Although there are places that have been repaired, according to the engineer's survey report, more than 65% cannot be used and new routes must be opened. The usable parts must also be reorganized. Therefore, the Highway Department of the Military Council appointed Chen Zhanxi, Director of the Guizhou Provincial Construction Department, as the director of the Guizhou-Yunnan Road, and established two general section engineering offices. Engineers Xu Mingjie and Zou Yuesheng were appointed to be in charge of engineering affairs, surveying and building as they went, in order to speed up the process. The earthwork project was handled by conscripting labor from the line and nearby counties according to the Hunan-Guizhou Highway method, and subsidies were given. The mountain opening project has been carried out by transferred northern engineering corps. Bridge and culvert projects are contracted separately. It is estimated that the road can be completed and opened to traffic in March or April this year. Above Luodian County, the Yunnan Provincial Government is responsible for construction, and it is also expected to be completed at the same time.</p>
<p>Engineering and Funding</p>
<p>The Yunnan-Guizhou Road is an important part of the Beijing-Yunnan National Highway, and the construction cannot be delayed. However, the route spans the Miaoling Mountains, with towering mountains, steep cliffs, and dangerous rocks. The difficulty of the project is incomparable to other roads. The road began surveying in October last year and started construction in sections in late November. Now, except for the 30 kilometers west of the Panjiang River, which has not yet been surveyed, the rest have been surveyed and construction has begun. As for the construction cost, if it is designed according to strict highway standards, it would cost 10,000 yuan per kilometer. Now, due to the short time and financial difficulties, the estimated total project cost is 910,000 yuan. However, Guizhou Province's financial resources are stretched, and most of the construction costs must be requested from the central government. The central government is also facing financial difficulties and has only approved a subsidy of 400,000 yuan. Therefore, the road project can only be planned and constructed within the scope of funds. The current Highway Department of the Military Council and the Guizhou Provincial Government are planning to find ways to increase funding, so that it can be completed on schedule.</p>
<p>Reorganization of the East Road</p>
<p>The Guibei Road, that is, the Guizhou section of the Hunan-Guizhou Highway, except for the section from Guiyang to Pingyue Ganba Shao, which was completed and opened to traffic earlier, now only connects the Yu village of Pingyue Ganba Shao to Wang village, which is 475 li long, of which there are 250 kilometers. It was originally established by the 2nd Route Army Headquarters of the Suppression Bandit Army, the Hunan-Guizhou Road Guizhou East Section Engineering Office and the Supervision Office, responsible for construction, dividing it into four engineering offices and thirty-eight sections, using military labor, ordinary labor, and hourly labor for construction. The original budget was 660,000 yuan, which was directly approved and applied by the Military Council. Construction started in March last year and was completed on August 31st. However, due to the urgency of time and insufficient funding, the selection of routes, the arrangement of slopes and bends, and the equipment of bridges and culverts were not perfect. Therefore, although the roadbed was completed, driving was dangerous. Later, the Highway Department of the Military Council sent personnel to survey and found that the steepness of the roads such as Goose Wing in Shibing Section, Wende Pass and Zhenxiong Pass in Zhenyuan Section, Panshan Xiangshui in Sansui Section, and Xianren Bridge in Qingxi Section were always above 15% to 25%. The bends of the roads in the mountains (commonly known as electric light lines) are mostly below 5 meters to 2 meters in radius. They have actually become a single-corner line. The roads on acute-angled bends have steep slopes, and the slopes of bends with a radius of less than 5 meters are also above 10%. The steep slopes of the adjacent bends are all dangerous and need to be improved. There are also many places where bridges, culverts, and drainage ditches need to be repaired. Therefore, the Reorganization Guizhou East Road Engineering Office was organized, and northern stonemasons were sent to start reorganizing the most dangerous Wende Pass, Zhenxiong Pass, Goose Wing, and Wangcheng Slope. The estimated budget is 130,000 yuan. It has now been completed and opened to traffic. It is continuing to survey the roads that should be changed west of Shibing and gradually improved.</p>
<p>Reorganization of Gui North Road</p>
<p>The Gui North Road, that is, the Guizhou section of the Sichuan-Guizhou Highway. Former Chairman of Guizhou Province, Zhou Xicheng, established the Road Administration Bureau for military relations and built the Gui Chima Road. The route goes from Guiyang via Xifeng, Zunyi, Tongzi, Guanshui, to Chishui. After the road was built to Tongzi, it was suspended due to the political changes in Guizhou Province. When Mao Guangxiang was in charge of Guizhou, he wanted to connect the transportation between Sichuan and Guizhou provinces. Therefore, he sent the former Director of Construction Department, Bin Juren, to survey the route with Sichuan Province, with Chongxi River as the intersection. Liu Jiefeng, the Deputy Director of the Highway Bureau, was appointed to supervise the construction of the Tongchong section, with salt tax surcharge as funding. In the spring of last year, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek urgently wanted to complete the Sichuan-Guizhou Road and still appointed Liu to be responsible for the Tongchong section. The General Staff also appointed Staff Officer Chen Keming to supervise the construction. The estimated budget was approved by Chen's staff and totaled more than 100,000 yuan. Later, Liu was imprisoned for some reason and was presided over by Staff Officer Chen. The Wujiang section was built by the arsenal of the Pacification Commissioner's Office stationed in Guizhou. By June last year, the Tongchong section of the earthen road was completed. At the same time, the Sichuan section was also completed. Therefore, it was possible to travel directly from Guiyang to Chongqing.</p>
<p>Reorganization Status</p>
<p>This route is 360 kilometers long from Guiyang to Xixi River. Because the terrain is dangerous, the mountains overlap, and the construction process is complicated, the engineering is mostly not up to standard, and driving is often dangerous. Later, the Highway Department of the Military Council sent engineer Wu Guoyun to survey the route. The following is an excerpt from his report on the current situation: Gui Tong Section: This section was not surveyed in detail and was mostly based on the original terrain. Therefore, there are many bends even on flat ground, and the slope fluctuates. Moreover, the roadbed is too badly damaged, uneven, and the mountain road is too narrow. It takes two times to back up the car before it can move forward. Moreover, steep bends often have steep slopes. Passengers are always worried when passing through here. There are also too few bridges, culverts, and ditches, which are not enough to drain the water. Most of those that exist are also decayed. Tongchong Section: This section is the most difficult part of the entire line. Although it is only more than 160 li, the mountains are steep and the roads are rugged. All difficult places have not been completed. There are several places where the slope is as high as 25%, and there are many places where it is 17% or 18%. Moreover, there are many sharp bends in the large slope, and there are uphill roads in the downhill routes, which further increases the slope. Therefore, the basic repair must be changed. The retaining walls that are built where the mountains are steep and there is no way to fill the soil are not built legally. As a result, they collapse after heavy rain. The incomplete drainage equipment is even worse than the Guitong section. A small number of road surfaces are paved. The most important bridge is the Sanyi River Bridge, which is 20 meters long. It was completely washed away by the flood shortly after completion. Seeing this, you can know its dangerous situation. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek believed that this road must be improved urgently and strictly ordered the Highway Department of the Military Council and the Guizhou Provincial Government to be responsible for the reconstruction. Therefore, in October last year, the Gui North Road Engineering Office was organized. Wei Yuanzhou, the construction director of Guizhou, served as the director, and engineer Wu Wenyun served as the deputy. First, the route on the north bank of the Wujiang River between Guiyang and Tongzi, and the wharf, bridges, culverts, and other projects were modified. A surveying team was first organized to carry out surveying and construction section by section. As for the reorganization project of the Gui Tong section, after the start of construction, Director Chen was stationed in Tong to supervise. In the past few months, the road project has been 80% or 90% completed and will be completed soon.</p>
<p>It is known that transportation in the southwest has always been inconvenient. Guizhou and Yunnan provinces are known as mountain countries, and transportation is even more difficult. Transportation construction is nothing more than railways, aviation, and highways. Although air transportation has been opened on the Beijing-Yunnan route last year, it is limited by load and is not suitable for the needs of ordinary society. In addition, the climate between Guizhou and Yunnan is bad, with rain and fog, and the route is often blocked and dangerous. Highways can only facilitate military affairs and the transportation of light industrial products. As for the fundamental plan, it still depends on the railway. Recently, the Southwest Railway has been actively prepared by the authorities. I hope that the people of the country will work hard to assist and promote its realization.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Soaring Rice Prices in Xiamen <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Forms an Evaluation Committee for Relief</p>
<p>Rice Merchants Request a Reduction in Taxes on Imported Rice</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Rice prices in Xiamen have risen from 12 yuan to 15 yuan per 100 kilograms in recent weeks, which has greatly affected the people's food, especially the poor. Stores with a slightly larger population will suddenly increase their daily rice expenditure by about one yuan. Zhangzhou and Quanzhou also experienced the same rice price panic. In order to stabilize rice prices, the municipal government specially appointed Wang Zhenmin, the chief of the first section, to convene the Chamber of Commerce and the Rice Industry Association to form a food evaluation committee to discuss methods for stabilizing rice prices and providing relief. Although rice prices have fallen slightly on the 24th and 25th, they have not yet returned to their original state. Rice merchants then submitted a request to the Chamber of Commerce to forward to the municipal government, requesting a reduction in rice tax on imported rice and an exemption from rice donation for exported Zhangzhou rice. It is known that the Fujian Province is not a rice-producing area. Only Zhangzhou in southern Fujian produces rice, but it is not enough to supply the needs of Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Xiamen. In the past, rice for Quanzhou and Xiamen was mostly supplied by Annam, Siam, and Rangoon. Since 1933, in order to provide relief to rural areas, import taxes on imported rice were collected. After Xiamen reduced the tax by half, the import of imported rice decreased significantly. Later, the full tax was levied, and the import of imported rice disappeared. The people's food in Quanzhou and Xiamen, in addition to relying on Zhangzhou rice, also relies on the so-called "Shanghai rice" from the Yangtze River. In the past, Zhangzhou rice and Bailan rice cost more than 6 yuan per stone (100 catties), and imported rice cost more than 5 yuan. Since the full tax on imported rice eliminated imports, the provincial government resumed the collection of Zhangzhou rice export donations of one yuan per package (160 catties) last winter. Zhang rice, which is every stone, immediately rose to seven yuan. In recent weeks, it has suddenly risen to eight yuan and six jiao. Xiamen needs 700 bags of rice every day, but according to a survey on the 24th, there are still more than 20,000 bags of rice in Xiamen, and there is also a lot of rice in Zhangzhou. It is not a rice shortage, but the rice price is still high. According to rice merchants, "the reason is that landlords and wealthy farmers in Zhangzhou hoard and speculate, and financial merchants also speculate in hoarding rice and refuse to sell it. For many years, southern Fujian has regarded imported rice as a regulator. The full tax on Tianjin rice is 2 yuan and 5 jiao per 100 catties, and 4 yuan and 3 jiao per package. Imported rice must be sold at about 9 yuan per 100 catties in Xiamen to make a profit. Since imported rice cannot be imported, the only thing that can be used to regulate it is "Shanghai rice". If the price of rice in Shanghai is high, the prices in Quanzhou and Xiamen will also be high. In Guangdong, the import of foreign rice is 1 yuan, 7 jiao, 2 fen, and 8 li per 100 yuan, which is equivalent to 1 yuan and 4 jiao in national currency, which is 1 yuan and 1 jiao less than Xiamen. Therefore, in order to stabilize the rice prices in Xiamen, Zhangzhou, and Quanzhou, it is appropriate to restore the half tax on imported rice. With imported rice regulation, rice prices will not be easily raised" (March 26).</p>
<h3 id="e72">Jiangxi and Anhui Provinces Jointly Discuss Loans for Tea Farmers <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>And Form a Sales Committee</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Our country's exports mainly include silk, tea, and tung oil. Jiangxi used to sell Ninghong (that is, Xiushui black tea) to Europe, America, and Nanyang countries. In 1928, 117,578 dan of black tea from Ninghong Qimen and other places were imported into our country, worth 2,452,874 taels of silver. In recent years, it has gradually declined. According to Jiujiang Customs statistics, Jiangxi tea exports were about 270,000 to 220,000 dan (100 catties) per year in the Qing Dynasty, and only 10,000 dan in 1932. In the past two years, tea trees in Xiushui area have been cut down as firewood, the leaves are old and no one picks them, and most of the tea gardens have been leveled into wasteland. Now that Qingming is approaching, it is the peak time for tea production. In the past, at this time of year, villagers gathered in Xiushui, Qimen, Wuhu, Deyu, Fuliang, and other counties, and thousands of tea workers picked tea. The songs of tea picking could be heard far and wide. Recently, the villagers are hesitant to move, and the money houses that lend money also have no money to lend. Tea farmers are sitting and waiting to die, tea workers have no livelihood, let alone improving and regaining international sales channels. The authorities of Anhui Province believe that the four counties of Wuyuan, Deyu, and Fuliang, which border Jiangxi and Anhui, are intertwined, especially in terms of economy and the entire foreign affairs, which cannot be separated. Therefore, they specially sent He Jiepu and Lu Zhenmu to Jiangxi to discuss methods to rescue the tea industry. Province Chairman Xiong Shihui believed that this move was related to the national economy and the people's livelihood and was extremely important. He convened the Provincial Committee Xiao Chun Jin, and Li, Acting Director of the Construction Department, the Special Commissioner of the First District, the National Economic Commission, Transportation, Yumin, and representatives of the two banks to jointly discuss the methods with He and Lu. A decision was made that the Bank of Communications would lend 800,000 yuan, and the local banks of Jiangxi and Anhui provinces would jointly lend 500,000 yuan, totaling 1.3 million yuan, to tea farmers. The National Economic Commission and the governments of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces would organize a sales cooperation committee to establish transportation offices in Jiujiang and Shanghai to seek outward sales. After the discussion, He and Lu have returned to Anhui to report, so as to proceed separately. In addition, regarding Ninghong, in addition to the establishment of a normal tea garden and manufacturing plant by the Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural College and the Construction Department, Yumin Bank, the Construction Department, and the Rural Service Area of the Economic Commission will also provide loans to handle all matters related to transportation and sales, in order to reverse the decline of the tea industry.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Recent Conditions of Mineral Resources in Anhui Province <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>——Last Year's Coal Production Reached 700,000 Tons——</p>
<p>Wuhu Communication: Anhui Province is extremely rich in mineral resources, such as Huaining.</p>
<p>Dongliu, Susong, Wangjiang, Suxian, Tongling, Qingyang, Guichi,</p>
<p>Wuhu, Fanchang, Chaoxian, Hanshan, and other counties' anthracite coal; Guangde,</p>
<p>Jingxian, Xuancheng, Ningguo, Huaiyuan, and other counties' bituminous coal;</p>
<p>Dangtu, Fanchang, Tongling, and other counties' iron; Jixi's antimony;</p>
<p>Guichi's alunite; Lujiang's alum; Qianshan, Taihu, Huo</p>
<p>Shan, Luan, Lihuang, and other counties' placer iron, are all being mined by the government and businesses,</p>
<p>yielding substantial profits. Other minerals, such as Xiuning County's [missing character], Chuxian's</p>
<p>copper, Jixi County's gold, Qingyang County's gypsum, have also been</p>
<p>discovered and are planned for mining. As for metal ores yet to be discovered,</p>
<p>it is said there are still many. The scientific verification of mineral composition is undertaken</p>
<p>by the Science Museum jointly established by the Construction and Education Departments, and this spring, a geological</p>
<p>mineral resources survey team will be established to investigate mineral resource distribution, in order</p>
<p>to facilitate development. All operating mines in the province can be divided into three types: state-owned, provincial, and privately operated. The provincially operated mines include two coal mines: Mantoushan and Shuidong. The Mantoushan Coal Mine</p>
<p>was leased to Xie Ji Company in the 21st year of the Republic (1932), and its performance has been good. The Shuidong Coal Mine</p>
<p>was leased to miner Yao Yugeng in the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). Due to handling</p>
<p>the transfer of mining rights, the start of operations was delayed. In addition, more than ten coal mine</p>
<p>areas have been reserved, but their rights have not yet been surveyed and licensed. The state-owned mines</p>
<p>include the Huainan and Lieshan coal mines. The Huainan Coal Mine is operated</p>
<p>by the Construction Committee, with a daily coal production of over 1,000 tons. The Lieshan Coal Mine was originally operated by miner Ni Daolang, and in the 16th year of the Republic (1927), it was taken over by the National Army for the Ministry of Industry to operate. It has now been changed to</p>
<p>a joint public-private operation. As for privately operated mines, most are coal mines, followed by iron mines. Alum and antimony mines are next. The number of newly licensed mining areas</p>
<p>is also increasing daily. As of now, there are a total of 85 licensed private mines, including 70 coal mines, one iron ore and sulfur mine</p>
<p>, and one sulfur mine, covering an area of 3,393 hectares, 49 ares, and 9 square millimeters.</p>
<p>Newly applied for mining areas by businesses include a total of 44 areas, including 38 coal mines, one gold mine,</p>
<p>one antimony mine, and four alunite mines, covering an area of 1,507 hectares, 26 ares, and 12 square millimeters. As for the total amount of mineral production, last year, a total of 400,715 tons of iron sand were produced, and the estimated coal production was around 700,000 tons.</p>
<p>4,000 tons of alum were produced, and the production of sulfur and antimony was several</p>
<p>hundred tons each. The total output of the above minerals is more than one million tons,</p>
<p>which is more than in previous years. A gold mine discovered in Jixi County</p>
<p>is also being planned for mining by the government and businesses through separate channels. (26th)</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Stalemate in Business Tax Dispute</p>
<p>The Wuxian various trade guilds are opposing</p>
<p>the Business Tax Bureau's direct collection of business tax. It is learned that the Jiangsu</p>
<p>Provincial Department of Finance has specially dispatched Yu Peng to Suzhou to meet with the county government, the Business Tax Bureau, and the</p>
<p>chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, inviting representatives from various industries to a meeting at the county government the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>However, only a dozen or so representatives from various industries attended, and representatives from important industries</p>
<p>were absent. At that time, Yu Peng expressed the Department of Finance's opinion that business tax must be collected directly. However, due to the absence of most industry representatives,</p>
<p>there was no concrete resolution, and the meeting adjourned. Yesterday (the 27th), representatives from various chambers of commerce inquired about everything, so Chairman Cheng of the Chamber of Commerce,</p>
<p>believing that this matter is of great importance, scheduled a meeting for April 2nd, convening representatives from various industries,</p>
<p>and inviting Yu Peng and Director Feng and others to attend, requesting a reduction in the business tax</p>
<p>rate to 0.2%, which has been disapproved by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>The Kunshan-Taicang Highway from Kunshan to Taicang has been completed and is scheduled to open on April 1st.</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Highway Administration specifically instructed Dong Shiqian, director of the Sujia Highway</p>
<p>Office, on the 27th to concurrently manage the Kuntai Road. The fare is set at</p>
<p>3 yuan in legal tender and 3 jiao for small baggage from Kunshan to Taicang. The entire line has a central station at Zhendong Farm.</p>
<p>Corrupt Official from Changshu Arrested in Suzhou</p>
<p>Jiang Kan, the former head of tooth tax in Changshu, embezzled 3,000 yuan of public funds and fled to</p>
<p>Suzhou. On the 27th, the county government received instructions from the Provincial Education Administration</p>
<p>to order the Public Security Bureau to arrest Jiang. Chief Zhu of the Second Section of the county government interrogated him once,</p>
<p>submitted a report to the province for instructions on how to handle the case, and at the same time sent Jiang to the Security Brigade</p>
<p>headquarters for temporary custody.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>Plans to Reconstruct City Gates</p>
<p>The six city gates here are still old-fashioned and very</p>
<p>narrow. Except for the southeast gates, which have had their barbicans demolished,</p>
<p>the others have not been changed. Currently, the authorities believe that the city gates are narrow, which is inconvenient</p>
<p>for traffic. They plan to rebuild the more important southeast gates according to the Suzhou Xinlumen</p>
<p>method, with double-ring arched gates, so that vehicles and pedestrians can enter and exit on separate paths.</p>
<p>Koreans Arrive for Sightseeing</p>
<p>Yesterday in the urban area, two foreigners wearing Chinese clothing</p>
<p>came to visit. At first, it was suspected that they were Japanese, but after police investigation,</p>
<p>they claimed to be Koreans. They came here for sightseeing and had no other intentions. Subsequently, the bureau dispatched police to accompany them for protection.</p>
<p>After a brief tour of the northern suburbs, they took a car and left Changshu for Kunshan. The bureau also notified</p>
<p>the Kunshan Public Security Bureau to be informed.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Goes to Capital for Training</p>
<p>The Ministry of Interior is holding a training institute for county and city administrators, gathering county magistrates from all over the country</p>
<p>to receive training in the capital. Chen Fu, the county magistrate of this county,</p>
<p>is in the first class and is allowed to report to Beijing on April 2nd. All county affairs</p>
<p>are entrusted to Secretary Xu Wei to handle in his absence.</p>
<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>Two Fires in One Day</p>
<p>The residence of a resident surnamed Li on Baihua Street in this county,</p>
<p>a spacious house, suddenly caught fire late at night on the 26th.</p>
<p>Instantly, raging flames soared into the sky, bursting through the roof. The family woke up in shock and immediately sounded the alarm for help.</p>
<p>The fire brigades in each district received the news and mobilized to extinguish the fire. However, it was quite far</p>
<p>from the river, and it was difficult to fetch water. For a time, it was impossible to put out the fire. As a result, the fire intensified, and Wang Youcai's account books, which were rented inside, were completely burned, and it spread to the neighboring Li family's</p>
<p>house. Also, at around 3 p.m. on the same day, a fire broke out on Shipijie Street in Xidamen,</p>
<p>burning down a large firewood shed.</p>
<p>Rehabilitating Opium Addicts in Batches</p>
<p>A total of 1,200 newly registered opium addicts in this county.</p>
<p>The head of the first department of the county government, Long Dengyun, will soon select younger ones and rehabilitate them in batches,</p>
<p>in order to comply with the directive to ban opium within a limited time.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Banks Implement Insurance for Rice</p>
<p>Wuxi Bank notified the rice and bean</p>
<p>trade association last winter, advocating for insurance on loans secured by rice, beans, grains, and miscellaneous items.</p>
<p>The rice industry reported this to the chamber of commerce, which invited the relevant storage facilities, rice mills, oil mills, flour mills, and other</p>
<p>industries to jointly discuss the matter. In principle, they did not object, but they believed that rice and grain loans</p>
<p>were different from other goods, and it was very difficult to handle. It was decided to discuss the matter again at the end of March of this year. Now that the deadline is approaching, the banking industry has</p>
<p>sent a letter urging the rice industry to finalize the measures as soon as possible. After several rounds of negotiations among the relevant industries,</p>
<p>it was ultimately determined that the rice, grain, and miscellaneous items in Wuxi are of a fluid nature and are different from the situation in other counties.</p>
<p>The various parties jointly sent a letter to the chamber of commerce to forward to the banking industry, requesting a postponement. However, the banking industry has decided to implement insurance</p>
<p>in accordance with its regulations starting on April 1st. If insurance is delayed, credit will be immediately suspended. However, the rice market in Wuxi</p>
<p>is the champion of the county's commerce. If the banking industry suspends credit, the impact will ripple throughout the county's entire commercial market. Therefore, the chamber of commerce is now adopting both parties' intentions and plans to make a final and effective</p>
<p>mediation.</p>
<p>Jiang Vessels Docking on the South Bank of Jiangyin</p>
<p>The Jiangyin County Chamber of Commerce previously believed that the fact that vessels navigating the Yangtze River did not dock in Jiangyin</p>
<p>was of great importance to the commerce of the county. It negotiated for the opening</p>
<p>of the coal mine company pier on the south bank to serve as a docking point for various vessels. A report was submitted to the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, which dispatched personnel to conduct a detailed survey of the waterway, deemed it feasible, and approved docking.</p>
<p>At the same time, it was agreed with the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company that, starting this month, all Jiang vessels</p>
<p>carrying goods from Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places would dock and unload on the south bank of Jiangyin, with a trial period of six months.</p>
<p>Now, the stall vendors bureau believes that after docking in Jiangyin,</p>
<p>whether the business can improve depends on whether agricultural and industrial products from Wuxi, Changzhou, and Chengjiang three counties</p>
<p>can be transported by the bureau. Yesterday, it specifically sent letters to the chambers of commerce of Wuxi, Changzhou, and Chengjiang, requesting them to inform the various industries</p>
<p>and provide support.</p>
<p>District Court Judge Dismissed for Accepting Bribes</p>
<p>The Zou Chengtai Rice Mill in Jiangjianshang outside the North Gate of this county and the Shanghai Yutai Rice Firm</p>
<p>were involved in a debt dispute, which implicated Chen Shitao, a judge in the civil division of this county's local court,</p>
<p>on suspicion of accepting bribes. The High Court dispatched Lu Wenqin, a prosecutor from the Wuxian Local</p>
<p>Court, to Wuxi to summon Zou Fuwei, Zou Songfan, Zou Jikang, Yang Shaoyun, and others for questioning, and released Judge Chen on bail. It was decided that a joint interrogation would be conducted again in Suzhou today (the 28th). Yesterday, Judge Chen had already been</p>
<p>dismissed by order of the Ministry of Justice and sent to Suzhou for interrogation.</p>
<p>Teacher-Student Love Affair Resolved</p>
<p>The teacher-student love affair that caused a sensation in Wuxi, involving Lu Qiangfen, a female student,</p>
<p>was publicly tried by the criminal court a few days ago. After being released on bail, she went to Sun</p>
<p>Zhonghao's house in Tangwan to move her belongings, but was stopped by the Sun family. Subsequently, Sun</p>
<p>Xicheng, a lawyer, went to the countryside with Town Head Sun Liangchu and both parties' relatives to discuss</p>
<p>a mediation plan. After reaching an agreement on the following terms: 1. Sun Zhonghao and Lu</p>
<p>Qiangfen shall terminate their marital relationship from this day forward. 2. All of Lu Qiangfen's personal</p>
<p>belongings shall be inventoried by the lawyer and taken away by Lu Qiangfen.</p>
<p>3. Lu Qiangfen may still have contact with her biological children. 4. Lu's children</p>
<p>shall be responsible for studying by the Sun family, with sons graduating from university and daughters graduating from middle school.</p>
<p>With the consent of both parties, a divorce agreement was written and signed separately.</p>
<p>Therefore, regarding the lawsuit, Sun Zhonghao may file a motion to withdraw the charges.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<p>Fundraising for Educational and Welfare Expenses</p>
<p>Nantong's various educational and welfare institutions are thoroughly reorganized.</p>
<p>The General Management Office for Educational and Welfare Undertakings has appointed Zhang Jingli</p>
<p>as the director. Zhang returned to Nantong from Shanghai on the 16th to inspect and improve the institutions. Regarding educational and welfare expenses,</p>
<p>they are currently planning to increase revenue. The Tienshenggang Zesheng Water Conservancy Company has been thoroughly reorganized, and the income from educational and welfare undertakings has increased</p>
<p>significantly.</p>
<p>Yangzhou</p>
<p>Joint Request for Survey and Repair of Guadong Riverbank</p>
<p>The Jijiagang area on the Guadong Riverbank in Hongqiao Township, Second District of Jiangdu,</p>
<p>is nearing repeated breaches and collapses, and the situation is extremely</p>
<p>dangerous. The embankments at Magang and near the Zhenyang Railway Station are also precarious.</p>
<p>Now, Niu Songnan of the township, Xu Kuanyu of Dongzhu Township, Liu Shizong of Puzhao Temple Township,</p>
<p>and Qi Yongtai of Guadong, and others, believing that the spring tide is approaching,</p>
<p>have jointly submitted a report to the Jiangdu County Construction Bureau, stating the previous situation and requesting the dispatch of personnel to investigate as soon as possible</p>
<p>and seek remedial measures.</p>
<p>Investigation into Head Selling Opium</p>
<p>Liu Zhiqin, the district head of the Fourth District of Jiangdu, because Zhang</p>
<p>Xiaojing, the fifteenth bao head of Touqiao Town, was jointly accused by his jia heads of selling opium, involving an employee</p>
<p>named Zong Xifu, who was allegedly bribed to provide protection. While the matter was under investigation, the four jia heads who signed the</p>
<p>accusation suddenly submitted a statement to the district office claiming that their names had been stolen and requesting</p>
<p>the withdrawal of the accusation and the investigation of the theft of names. On the 25th, the district office specifically instructed</p>
<p>Peng Songjiu, the town head of Touqiao, to investigate the truth and report back in detail for submission to the county for verification.</p>
<p>Huaiyin</p>
<p>Tragic Incident of Vicious Dog Mauling</p>
<p>Meng Hanzi, a resident outside Beiyu in Wangying Town of this county,</p>
<p>has two sons, the elder being nine years old and the younger being three years old.</p>
<p>He works as a vegetable seller. Yesterday (the 23rd), Meng and his wife went out on business, leaving the two sons at home.</p>
<p>However, the younger son was suffering from scarlet fever and had a foul odor.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, after Meng and his wife left, a vicious dog suddenly</p>
<p>entered the room, smelling the foul odor emanating from the younger son, and fiercely bit his face.</p>
<p>Because the child was small and severely injured, he died instantly. The elder son, seeing this, cried out in alarm,</p>
<p>and took a wooden stick to chase the dog away. Neighbors heard the cries and rushed over, but the dog had already disappeared.</p>
<p>Soon after, Meng's wife returned home first and asked what had happened. The elder son, fearing, dared not speak. Meng's</p>
<p>wife, heartbroken over the younger son's tragic death, accidentally hit the elder son's head with a stick,</p>
<p>leaving it bloody and mangled. He also died soon after. By the time Meng Hanzi returned home, his wife</p>
<p>had fled in fear of punishment. Within one household, two children died on the same day, and a wife was lost.</p>
<p>The situation was extremely tragic.</p>
<p>Gaoyou</p>
<p>Farmer Hangs Himself Due to Poverty</p>
<p>Xu Chenglai, a farmer in the vicinity of Changgouji in the seventh district of Husi County,</p>
<p>is nearly fifty years old. He has a wife</p>

<h3 id="e74">Bank Acceptance Exchange Holds First General Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Thirty-Eight Member Institutions Approve Xinhua Bank's Admission</p>
<p>Total Acceptance Amount Reaches 30,495,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Regulations Stipulate the Types of Collateral and Rediscount Methods</p>
<p>The "Bank Acceptance Exchange," affiliated with the Shanghai Banking Association Joint Reserve Committee, has been established and commenced operations since the 16th of this month. Internal procedures have been completed, and member banks have fully subscribed to the acceptance fund. A first general meeting since its establishment was held at the Hong Kong Road Banking Club yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. to report on the progress. More than thirty representatives from all member banks, including Wu Yunzhai, Sun Jingxi, Wang Boyuan, and Yang J眉i, attended. Chairman Li Fusun presided over the meeting. First, the chairman briefly described the establishment of the acceptance exchange and the need to develop a bill discounting system. Then, Zhu Boquan, the manager of the exchange, reported on the progress since its establishment and passed a motion to admit Xinhua Bank as a member bank of the Joint Reserve Committee. Details of the events are recorded below:</p>
<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>Chairman Li Fusun stated:</p>
<p>In the past, the financial organization in Shanghai</p>
<p>had many imperfections. The most important</p>
<p>deficiencies were the lack of a clearing house and</p>
<p>a bill discounting system. These shortcomings</p>
<p>caused the industry to experience various inconveniences. Therefore, the first task of this committee</p>
<p>after its establishment was to organize a clearing</p>
<p>house. The clearing house has already achieved some success. However, the development of a bill discounting system has not yet begun. Without a discounting system, the industry's capital cannot be used flexibly and smoothly. When the market is bad, funds that are usually loaned out become stagnant on the books and cannot circulate, often leading to difficulties in turnover. The current market stagnation and the reduced capital utilization capacity of the industry are due to the lack of a discounting system. To develop a discounting system, we must first develop discountable bills. If there are bills but no "discount</p>
<p>market" to allow holders to discount them at any time, the discounting function cannot be fully utilized. Therefore, we in the industry have decided to organize a "Bank Acceptance Exchange" ourselves to create a type of discountable bill. These bills are issued by member banks of the acceptance exchange and accepted by the exchange. The form is the same as ordinary "banker's acceptances." Our "acceptances" are secured by commercial paper already discounted by member banks and other assets. Once accepted, the exchange will establish a discounting trading method to allow industry members holding our acceptances to realize them at any time, creating a rudimentary "discount market." In this way, some of the funds loaned out by the industry, which were originally fixed assets, can now be replaced with our acceptances and become liquid assets.</p>
<p>At the same time, our acceptances are well-guaranteed and highly flexible. All industry members can use their surplus funds to discount them. Bills purchased through discounting can be stored to earn interest and can still be rediscounted to other industry members or rediscounted to the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank when necessary. The surplus funds paid out for discounting are no different from storing them in one's own vault. Even if the amount of operating reserves is slightly reduced, there is nothing to fear. Moreover, the interest rate on discounting is usually lower than ordinary interest rates. In the future, as discountable bills develop, the overall market interest rate can also be lowered, increasing the industry's liquid assets and appropriately reducing normal operating reserves. This indirectly increases the industry's capital utilization capacity, expands the industry's business, and increases the industry's operating profits. However, the most important thing is that our industry can fully utilize this power to support industry and commerce, so that industry and commerce can also benefit significantly. We sincerely hope that all industry members will use our "acceptances" to gradually revitalize the current stagnant situation and develop "discountable bills," "discount markets," and "rediscounting" simultaneously, creating a perfect discounting system. Regarding the establishment process of our exchange and the current undertakings, please listen to Manager Zhu's detailed report.</p>
<p>Member Banks</p>
<p>Next, Mr. Zhu Boquan reported that</p>
<p>the initial number of member banks was</p>
<p>thirty-four. Subsequently, four more banks joined, making a total of</p>
<p>thirty-eight. All thirty-eight member banks have now signed public</p>
<p>agreements. These thirty-eight member banks are also member</p>
<p>banks and clearing banks of the Joint Reserve Committee. The list is as follows: Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Four Banks Savings Association, Y盐业 Bank, Zhongfu Bank, Siming Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Xinhua Bank, Continental Bank, Yongting Bank, China Industrial Bank, China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Jiangsu Bank, Guohua Bank, China Reclamation Bank, China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Tonghe Bank, Women's Commercial and Savings Bank, China National Products Bank, Juxingcheng Bank, China Bank, Zhonghui Bank, China National Industrial Bank, China Enterprise Bank, Hengli Bank, Silk Industry Bank, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Bank, Zhongyi Trust Company, Zhejiang Local Bank, Sichuan Meifeng Bank, Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank, Yongda Bank, and Pudong Bank.</p>
<p>Acceptance Fund</p>
<p>The amount of bill acceptance fund subscribed</p>
<p>by member banks is proportional to each bank's paid-up</p>
<p>capital and total reserve fund. This subscribed</p>
<p>fund has now been fully paid up, totaling 7,623,750 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Total Acceptance Amount</p>
<p>The exchange's acceptance amount</p>
<p>for member banks is also proportional to each bank's paid-up</p>
<p>capital and total reserve fund. Each bank separately</p>
<p>establishes the acceptance amount with the exchange through acceptance agreements. These acceptance agreements have also been signed by all banks, with the total acceptance amount set at 30,495,000 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Types of Collateral</p>
<p>Among the collateral accepted by the exchange, there</p>
<p>is a category of various major domestic products. The</p>
<p>types of domestic products are currently provisionally limited to fifteen: rice, wheat, flour,</p>
<p>coarse grains, cotton, grey cloth, sugar, silk, cocoons, tea,</p>
<p>tobacco leaves, coal, iron, and paper.</p>
<p>Discount Methods</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the discounting of the</p>
<p>exchange's acceptances by various banks and</p>
<p>promote the development of a discount market, the exchange has formulated a temporary trading method for discounting. Any member bank wishing to buy or sell</p>
<p>the exchange's acceptances can notify the exchange of the amount and interest rate at a designated time each day. If the amounts and interest rates requested by both parties match, the exchange will notify both parties to complete the transaction procedures. If there are sellers but no buyers on a given day, the Joint Reserve</p>
<p>Committee can discount the entire amount at the specified discount rate. The minimum transaction amount is 50,000 yuan, and the interest rate is calculated at a certain number of fen per thousand yuan per day. If a discounting bank needs to, it can rediscount the bills to other banks or to the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank. The principle of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank handling rediscounting has been established, but the details are still under discussion. Furthermore, the accounting of the Joint Reserve Committee and the acceptance exchange is completely independent. The exchange's acceptances can also be discounted by the committee when necessary. Therefore, the committee's discount rate is also posted and announced daily.</p>
<p>Bill Format</p>
<p>The exchange's acceptances have recently been</p>
<p>printed and distributed to member banks for use.</p>
<p>The format of these acceptances is the same as ordinary "banker's acceptances." It is a three-part form. The left end is the issuing bank's stub, the right end is the acceptance application, and the middle part is the "acceptance." Issuing bank stub: branch number, amount, term, acceptor, issue date, acceptance date, maturity date, remarks. Acceptance application: "In accordance with the terms and conditions stated in our bank's acceptance agreement No. 〇 dated 〇〇 year 〇 month 〇 day of the Republic of China, we hereby apply for acceptance of banker's acceptance No. 〇 (Chinese characters) for the face amount of 〇〇 yuan in national currency, using the property and goods deposited by our bank with your exchange as collateral. Please accept the bill and return the original bill to us. Sincerely, 〇〇〇 of the Bank Acceptance Exchange, 〇〇 year 〇 month 〇 day." Acceptance bill: "Pay 〇〇〇 after 〇〇 days from the date of issue for the amount of 〇〇〇 national currency. To: Shanghai Bank Acceptance Exchange for verification and payment. Issuer: 〇〇〇, 〇〇 year 〇 month 〇 day of the Republic of China." "This bill has been accepted today and will be paid in full on the maturity date of 〇〇 year 〇 month 〇 day without fail. Acceptor: Bank Acceptance Exchange of the Shanghai Banking Association Joint Reserve Committee, Manager 〇〇〇, Director 〇〇〇, 〇〇 year 〇 month 〇 day of the Republic of China." The words "Banker's Acceptance" are printed in the middle.</p>
<h3 id="e75">New Outlets for Banks <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Organizing Rural Lending Institutions</p>
<p>Shiye News Agency reports: Since the Ministry of Finance officially announced on November 4 last year that the banknotes of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications would be legal tender, commercial banks have complied and ceased issuing banknotes. Their main business has largely become government bonds and mortgages. At the end of last year, they all had large surpluses. However, since the beginning of this year, the number of mortgages has decreased, resulting in a large concentration of cash within the banks, making it difficult to find outlets. As a result of repeated meetings and consultations, it was decided to jointly organize a large-scale rural lending institution to provide relief to rural areas and find outlets for cash. According to reporter inquiries, the banks have reached a consensus and plan to establish a head office in Shanghai and branch offices in various counties, cities, and villages based on actual needs. This plan is currently being actively pursued and will soon be realized.</p>

<p>Disinfected and Shipped to Various Provinces for Mass Propagation</p>
<p>The Cotton Control Committee of the National Economic Council, the Central Cotton Improvement Institute, and the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce have been cooperating and, in the past three years, have jointly conducted large-scale regional trials of Chinese and American cotton varieties with twenty domestic agricultural institutions. The results showed that the American Si Zi Cotton No. 4 purebred has excellent yields. The yield per mu is more than 20% higher than existing American cotton varieties. It performs best in the provinces of North China. Its characteristics are numerous fruit branches, rich boll formation, early maturity, and superior quality, surpassing the old Tuo Zi Cotton Ai Zi Cotton and others. Last winter, the committee ordered twenty-one tons of this Si Zi cotton seed from the United States. After arriving in Shanghai at the beginning of this month, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau was entrusted with disinfection to prevent the introduction of insects and bacteria attached to the cotton seeds into the country. It is reported that the disinfection procedures have been completed, and the seeds have been delivered to the Railway Bureau to be shipped to Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, and other provinces for proper propagation.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports: Details of the arrest of communist elements and the shooting of police officers at Fudan University in Jiangwan have been reported in various newspapers. Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. Reporters visited Mr. Wu at the Municipal Government to inquire about his views. He gave a brief statement amidst his busy schedule: On the negative side, the competent authorities should be immediately instructed to promptly search for and arrest the reactionary elements who fired the shots. On the positive side, the school should immediately be responsible for restoring normalcy. Fortunately, the incident has not been expanded. The intention of the reactionary elements in firing was to incite the police officers and expand the incident into a tragedy. However, the police officers on duty were able to remain calm and did not retaliate. As a result, those shot and killed were all police officers, not students. This prevented the reactionary elements from carrying out their dangerous schemes. This is a blessing in disguise.</p>

<p>The United States is the largest consumer of raw silk in the world. Its annual import of raw silk is over 500,000 dan, of which Japan supplies 450,000 dan, while our country, even in the prosperous year of the silk industry last year, only supplied over 20,000 dan. In the year before last, exports to the United States were less than 10,000 dan. Most of the raw silk imported by the United States is handled by the Gan Li Company, which holds an important position in the American silk industry. For example, the Raw Silk Exchange was initiated by Gan Li, the founder of the company, and the Raw Silk Importers Association was also founded by him. Two years ago, he also organized the International Silk Association to promote pure silk fabrics and expand the use of raw silk. Our country's silk industry groups donated 5,000 for publicity purposes. Mr. Gan Li, recognizing that our country is the birthplace of sericulture but that its production and quality are not what they used to be, has taken time out of his busy schedule to come to China for a field investigation. He arrived in Shanghai with his wife on the Chichibu Maru on the 25th of this month. Local silk industry leaders such as Xue Shou Xuan, Shen Hua Chen, Zhu Jing An, Miao Zhong Xiu, and Li Shu Chu welcomed him at the pier. The day before yesterday, Gan Li hosted a banquet at the Cathay Hotel, inviting over fifty Chinese and foreign silk industry professionals, including Shen Hua Chen and Miao Zhong Xiu, to exchange ideas in detail. Yesterday, Mr. and Mrs. Gan, at the invitation of Xue Shou Xuan of the Wuxi Yongtai Silk Factory, took an early train to Wuxi, accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Miao Zhong Xiu and Xue Zu Kang, to visit the silk factory. They are scheduled to return to Shanghai by car at 5 p.m. to attend a public banquet hosted by the Shanghai Silk Industry Groups, the Commodity Inspection Bureau, and the Zhejiang Provincial Sales Promotion Committee. It is reported that Mr. Gan Li will leave Shanghai on the morning of the 30th.</p>

<p>Re-election Procedures to be Entirely Restarted</p>
<p>Regarding the scheduled by-election for foreign directors of the Public Concession's Labor Bureau, according to reliable information from the Labor Bureau's information department, the Norwegian Consul General and leading Consul Mr. Ayr have sent a letter to the Labor Bureau stating that the consulates of various countries in Shanghai believe that in the previous election this year, 323 ballots were inadvertently not included in the Board of Directors election report announced by the Labor Bureau on March 24th. Therefore, the election should be considered invalid. Mr. Ayr also announced that the Labor Bureau's Board of Directors election is scheduled for April 20th and 21st, Monday and Tuesday. Furthermore, he stated that the consuls' intention is that this by-election should restart all procedures, such as the nomination of candidates, in accordance with Article 18 of the Land Regulations. As a result, the Director-General of the Labor Bureau has issued a notice stipulating April 20th and 21st as the dates for the 1936 Labor Bureau Board of Directors election. Nomination papers for candidates must be submitted to the Director-General of the Labor Bureau no later than 12:00 noon on April 9th (Thursday). The previous Labor Bureau Notice No. 4679 should be declared revoked.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Director-General of the Labor Bureau, Mr. Fessenden, was quite furious about the oversight in the previous election, which resulted in the omission of 323 votes. Yesterday, he specifically stated to others that he was determined to immediately conduct a thorough investigation to clarify the truth.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Haiyun and Ingeren Collide in Huangpu River Yesterday <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Both Vessels Sustained Damage</p>
<p>The "Haiyun" wheel, formerly known as the "Daffy," operated by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, specializes in the Shanghai-to-Lianyungang (Haizhou) route. It arrived in Shanghai fully loaded with goods transported via the Longhai Railway yesterday morning at 5:30 AM, just as the Norwegian ship "Ingeren," chartered by the Kailan Mining Administration, was arriving from Qinhuangdao fully loaded with coal. The "Ingeren" was in front, and the "Haiyun" was behind, sailing in close succession. When they reached the vicinity of the fourth river channel near the Yangshupu Power Plant, they collided. The outer iron plates on the "Haiyun" wheel's port bow were dented, and the mast on the "Ingeren" ship's aft deck starboard side was broken, the railings were completely destroyed, and the iron plates were also damaged. After the accident, both parties stopped to observe each other before sailing to Yangjiadu and the China Wharf to dock. The "Haiyun" shipowner, Huang, immediately reported to the headquarters, and the Norwegian ship also reported to Kaiji. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company immediately sent Chief Engineer Cao Shoulian to the "Haiyun" first, and decided to go to the Norwegian ship for inspection. At the same time, they reported to the China United Ship Insurance Association, requesting them to send a surveyor to inspect the ship as soon as possible. The issue of responsibility will be discussed separately.</p>
<h3 id="e88">"Gonglai" Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday: Major Collision with "Haicheng" in Guangdong <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Both Vessels Sustained Significant Damage</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Gonglai" wheel, weighing 2,705 tons, with a length of 320 feet, a width of 46 feet, a depth of 21 feet and 1 inch, a draft of 16 feet and 2 inches, two decks, a horsepower of 2,020, a steam pressure of 160, and a speed of 9.5 nautical miles per hour, was built in England in 1894. The vessel usually sailed the northern and southern oceans, also served as a training vessel for graduates of the Wusong Merchant Marine School. It had sailed from Guangdong back to Shanghai, carrying 6,000 bags of Cantonese sugar and other goods, with a considerable number of passengers. The "Gonglai" wheel had just left Bai'etan in Guangzhou, less than half an hour before it collided head-on with the "Haicheng" wheel.</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Collision</p>
<p>According to shipowner Gunker (a Russian), the "Gonglai" wheel left Guangzhou at 5:01 PM on the 17th of this month, but by 5:30 PM, the ship had not yet left Huangpu Port when the major accident occurred. At this time, there was fog in the port, and the shipowner was on duty (shipowners are responsible for navigation within the port). As the "Gonglai" wheel was proceeding, it encountered the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Min-Yue class steamer "Haicheng" (3,600 tons), which was carrying a large quantity of cargo and passengers from Fujian to Guangzhou. The "Haicheng" wheel was fast and powerful, and when it met the "Gonglai" wheel, the heavy fog prevented them from avoiding each other in advance, resulting in the bow side of the "Gonglai" wheel colliding heavily with the midship section of the "Haicheng" wheel. Both sides sustained significant damage at the time.</p>
<p>"Gonglai" Suffers Two Breaches</p>
<p>After the collision between the "Gonglai" and "Haicheng" wheels, the outer iron plates of the "Gonglai" wheel's keel side were completely dented, and the ribs of the hull were also bent. In the forward hold on the port side, two large holes were breached, and the forward water tank immediately flooded. Furthermore, the anchor on the port side of the bow was shattered, demonstrating the violence of the collision and the extent of the damage to the "Gonglai" wheel. After the accident, the "Gonglai" immediately stopped, and the shipowner inspected the damage while also examining the damage to the "Haicheng".</p>
<p>"Haicheng" Seriously Damaged</p>
<p>When the "Haicheng" wheel collided heavily with the "Gonglai", it was unable to stop immediately. Due to its great speed, the "Haicheng" wheel was damaged from the midship engine room to the stern. A large hole was breached in the engine room, so the damage was more serious than that of the "Gonglai". The "Haicheng" had more cargo and passengers than the "Gonglai". After the accident, in addition to the shipowners meeting to inspect and certify each other, the "Haicheng" took measures to sail to the dock, unload the cargo and passengers, and then undergo major repairs after inspection by a surveyor.</p>
<p>"Gonglai" Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>After the collision, the "Gonglai" was unable to sail, and the forward water tank was flooding, creating a dangerous situation. The shipowner urgently returned to the Guangzhou dock, first using cement and wooden boards to fill the two holes, and then pumping out the water that had entered the hold. As a result, the "Gonglai" was delayed in Guangzhou for another three days. It finally set sail for Shanghai on the morning of the 21st, and arrived at the Wusong estuary at 7:30 AM yesterday morning. It then sailed to Huazhan to unload sugar, and the shipowner reported the accident and the collision to the Bureau. At the same time, he notified the insurance company, requesting them to send personnel for inspection.</p>
<p>Repairs After Inspection</p>
<p>The "Gonglai" ship arrived in Shanghai and docked on the Jiangmian of Jinliyuan Wharf. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sent Chief Engineer Cao Shoulian to inspect the ship and inquired with the shipowner, Guntker, about all the details of the collision. The "Gonglai" now requires major repairs, making it difficult to sail immediately. Today, it is still necessary to wait for the insurance company's surveyor to inspect the ship before a decision can be made on repairs. The extent of the damage to the "Haicheng" wheel has not yet been reported.</p>

<p>Total Relief Funds Amount to Over 190,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission, located at 505 Henan Road in Shanghai, recognizing the severity of last summer's floods, specially obtained approval from the Ministry of Interior to carry out river flood relief work, raise relief funds, and provide relief to the disaster victims. From August last year to the end of February this year, a total of 190,382.50 yuan in national currency was used for work relief and emergency relief. The relief area covers 58 counties in Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, Hebei, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Fujian provinces. Among them, the work relief in northern Jiangsu, repairing the Xuzhou-Haizhou highway and the lake embankment, required the most funds, totaling more than 50,000 yuan. It was decided to dredge the Quanhe River in Wenshang County, Shandong, and 25,000 yuan in national currency and 1,000 bags of flour were allocated. The emergency relief was mainly distributed in Jining, Jinan, Yanzhou, De County, Longshan, Zhen County, Yi County, Zou County, Linqing, Tai'an in Shandong, Suqian, Xuzhou, Haizhou in Jiangsu, and Yanshi and Huaiqing in Henan.</p>
<h3 id="e93">China International Famine Relief Commission: Reported Tragic Famine Situation in Huoqiu <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The drought in northwestern Anhui Province has become increasingly severe since spring, with Huoqiu in western Anhui being the most tragic. Yesterday, Mr. Chen Shifu, a representative from the county, arrived at the China International Famine Relief Commission on Renji Road in Shanghai, having traveled a long distance to personally beg for relief. He brought photos of the disaster victims and five kinds of food for survival: sorghum bran, sorghum lees, locust fruit, elm bark flour, and sesame cakes. He said that dozens of people are starving to death every day. The representative is the chairman of the Huoqiu County Early Disaster Relief Association, is already old, and his beard is almost reaching his chest. He almost cried as he spoke of the various aspects of the disaster, which is imaginable. He also presented a letter from County Magistrate Wei Liren, which is transcribed as follows: "The drought last summer was extremely severe, and the entire county, whether fertile or barren, was a barren land. The warehouses are empty, and the people's food is exhausted. Since the spring, there has been rain and snow, and the cold wind has been strong. The disaster victims who are displaced and wandering have no way to meet their basic needs of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. They stumble and fall, and the dead are seen on the roads. According to a recent survey, during the Lantern Festival and around February 2nd, dozens of people were starving to death on the outskirts of the city because they had no way to beg for food due to the heavy snow. More than a dozen cases are also reported daily inside and outside the city gates. Changtangshao, Chalu Kou, Lianhua Temple, and Wolong Temple in the south of the county are the most affected. It is also reported that some people are eating human flesh. The starving people fill the streets, their faces are haggard, and they are on the verge of death. The old, weak, and disabled are huddled in the mud, lying there stiff and slanting. People who pass by their side hear them call for help, which is unbearable to hear. This is truly a rare disaster unseen in nearly a hundred years. There are still a hundred days before the wheat harvest. How can we endure the long night? We have specially appointed Chairman Chen Shifu to bring photos of the disaster and personally present the disaster situation, and to request a large amount of relief funds to save the spring famine and protect the lives of the people." It is reported that the association has decided to allocate 20,000 yuan and is setting up a branch in Yingshang to carry out relief work for the disaster victims in the eight counties of northwestern Anhui Province. However, the disaster is severe and the funds are limited. We hope that all circles will be aroused and provide full assistance to save more lives.</p>

<h3 id="e99">The Post Office Robbery Case Appeal Result: Monk Wukong Sentenced to Death; Monk Disagrees with Original Sentence, Appeal Rejected <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Last September 9th, the thieving monk Wukong (also known as Ji Rentang) led a gang armed with weapons to break into the General Post Office on North Sichuan Road, robbing the bureau of over 90,000 yuan in banknotes and coins destined for the Savings and Remittance Bureau. They also shot and killed the escorting personnel. After the incident, they fled to Funing, Jiangbei. Subsequently, the police sent detectives who successively arrested several of his accomplices. After interrogation by the First Special District Court, they were found guilty and sentenced accordingly. The thieving monk, dissatisfied with his life sentence, appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The Municipal Council, however, argued that the thieving monk was the ringleader and should be executed according to the law. The initial sentence of life imprisonment was insufficient to deter others. Therefore, they also filed an appeal, requesting a death sentence. The Second Branch of the High Court, presided over by Judge Yu of the Criminal Division, specially convened a collegiate bench to finalize the interrogation.

<h3 id="e102">Vegetable Vendors on Zhabei Sanlu Road Request City Government Approval to Set Up Stalls <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>According to the Ta Kung Press, one hundred and forty-four vegetable vendors from the Sanyang Road area in Zhabei, including Cao Asi, Sun Shuangshou, Tao Chengshan, Pan Zhenghe, and Sun Afu, petitioned the Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday, requesting that the City Government be consulted to allow them to set up stalls to make a living. Their joint petition stated: "We, the undersigned, jointly petition that, without the City Government's approval, our livelihoods are on the verge of collapse, and we are facing imminent death, causing widespread panic. We earnestly request relief to maintain the people's livelihood. We citizens, young and old, have come from afar to Shanghai to seek a livelihood. Unfortunately, we encountered the Shanghai war, so we are still at risk of starvation. We were able to reach our present state thanks to the loan capital provided by the refugee relief center in the war zone. As a result, we were saved from fire and water and became small vegetable vendors, barely surviving. Unexpectedly, last winter, the manager surnamed Deng of the newly built vegetable market on Yanjia Ge Road, without considering the circumstances or respecting the law, due to the sluggish market, unexpectedly led gangsters to Sanyang Road, driving us citizens to the vegetable market to set up stalls and do business. We believe that as poor people seeking a living, we have not committed any illegal acts. Although the City Government has not explicitly approved it, the Finance Bureau directly under the City Government has been collecting donations monthly for several years. This shows the government's indirect approval. Even if the road is opened and stalls are prohibited, the administrative authorities should announce it to the public so that the ban can be enforced within a time limit. Moreover, the Deng surname's private vegetable market belongs to merchants, so how can they prohibit us without authorization? If they were acting on orders, they should bring official documents to facilitate enforcement. Otherwise, it is impossible to accept their orders. The Deng surname, feeling unjustified, left without a word. The next day, he intensified his actions, bringing trucks and arresting hundreds of vendors, sending them to the North Station Branch for investigation. The bureau chief, without distinguishing right from wrong, immediately detained us, causing us pain. Therefore, we jointly submit this petition to your department, requesting that you consult the City Government to allow us to set up stalls temporarily to maintain the livelihoods of thousands of poor people. We earnestly request that you consider the situation and provide appropriate relief."</p>

On the donation side, leaders from all walks of life have been invited to form a Donation Committee, with Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Qian Xinzhi, Yu Zuoting, Lin Kanghou, Yu Hede, and Zhao Jinqing serving as the Presidium of the committee to assist in planning. According to statistics, over one thousand people are participating in this fundraising effort. Since the opening on the 9th of this month, there have been two announcements of results, totaling 38,177 points, as reported in the previous newspaper.

<p>Wedding Expenses Also Came from Robbery</p>
<p>The Young Woman Was Deceived and Filled with Remorse</p>
<p>Chief Detective Yun Agen, Detective Xie Shuiquan, Detective Pang Ruiqing, and Pang Yutang of the Old Gate Police Station, previously arrested the following criminals at No. 18, Lane 8, Xiai Ensi Road: Zhang Shunjin, Jiang Siwen, Wu Aqing, Chen Zongbao, Zhao Atang, Wang Aming, Ni Wenming, Zhu Renhuo, and women Wang Alian and Jiang Sunshi. They confiscated two pistols, 255 bullets, one Mauser pistol, and 89 bullets. It was found that the suspects had committed many crimes, including: Shooting and killing Ye Rongjun at No. 21, Lane 17, Yuanfang Road; Robbing the home of Dr. Zheng Xuetang at No. 3, Lane 146, Laohuo Road, of 441 yuan in property; Robbing the home of Xu Caoshi at No. 41, Lane 962, North Chengdu Road, of 2,469 yuan; Robbing the home of Chen Detang at No. 14, Fudeli, South Chengdu Road, of 194 yuan; Robbing the home of Chen Baorong at No. 31, Lane 220, Gongping Road, of 500 yuan; Robbing the home of Xia Yaoshi at No. 40, Lane 239, Aiwenyi Road, and taking the pistol from doorman Yu Chuntang, while also firing shots as a warning. They were handed over to the First Special District Court. Except for Jiang Sunshi, who was released by the police due to insufficient evidence, the rest were detained. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Pan Shide held another hearing and ordered a postponement. However, there is an interesting anecdote: Jiang Sunshi, originally named Xiuying, is 22 years old and from Shanghai. Her father was originally a legitimate merchant. Recently, through an intermediary, she married Jiang Siwen (also known as Achao, 27 years old, from Changzhou). In January of this year, she participated in a group wedding in Shanghai. They cohabited at No. 13, Lane 9, Xujiahui Road. Unexpectedly, Jiang was actually a notorious thief, and the wedding expenses came from robbery. Less than a month after the marriage, she was arrested by the police. Fortunately, the detectives found that Sunshi was not involved and released her. Like Sunshi, who was deceived and suffered several days in prison, her inner pain is unimaginable.</p>

<p>The Power of Candy and Biscuits is Great</p>
<p>Smiling and Explaining Everything</p>
<p>Chen Hongfu, a farmer from Chongming, living in Yanjiajiao, Gaoqiao, Pudong, was brutally murdered on the night of October 26th of the lunar calendar last year. His body was abandoned on the beach. Afterwards, the prosecutor's office of the local court arrested and detained his wife, Chen Huangshi, and his maternal uncle, Chen Zhiliang, who were suspected of being involved, and filed a public prosecution for murder. Judge Cai Dincheng of the Criminal Division is re-examining the case. Because the deceased's six-year-old daughter, Chen Xuezhen, was in court but remained silent, making it difficult to take her statement, it was ordered that Chen Xuezhen be sent to the Zhenru Forensic Institute to examine the truth of her unwillingness to speak, as reported in this newspaper. Now, it is learned that the director of the institute, Sun Kuifang, first used candy and biscuits as bait. Xuezhen, a poor child from the countryside, suddenly saw so much food, and her face immediately showed a smile. Director Sun asked her how old she was and what her name was. The child replied that she was six years old and her name was Xuezhen. He also asked how many brothers she had, and she replied two: the eldest brother is called Genxiang, and the second brother is called Jinxiang. He also asked where her parents were, and she replied that her father was dead, and her mother and younger brother were in the bureau. Director Sun then sent a letter to Judge Cai, reporting the details of the interview, and returned Xuezhen to the court. Yesterday, Judge Cai ordered the deceased's brother, Chen Qiufu, to come to court and hand Xuezhen over to him for care, pending further instructions.</p>

<p>Thief Wounded in the Leg by a Knife Escapes</p>
<p>Two Thieves Arrested Confess Without Hesitation</p>
<p>At around 9 PM the night before last, two patrol officers from the South City Rihui Bridge Police Station were patrolling Dapu Road when they saw eight bandits approaching. Knowing they were not good people, they immediately ordered them to stop and stepped forward to check. Unexpectedly, the bandits fired first, shooting at the police officers and daring to seize the firearms carried by the officers. The police officers also fired back. More than ten shots were fired on both sides, but fortunately, no one was injured. One of the bandits grabbing a gun was wounded in the leg by the police officer's bayonet, but he still managed to escape with the other bandits. Only two bandits were captured and taken to the West Gate Branch for interrogation. One confessed his name as Bai Jinbo, 38 years old, and the other confessed his name as Xu Youkui, 37 years old, both from Funing. They confessed that they were invited by the escaped accomplices to rob a family surnamed Mo at Xieqiao Tou. They were ordered to be detained and a police team was dispatched to apprehend the escaped bandits, bringing them to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Workers at Yu Feng Spinning Mill Organize National Salvation Association <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Found to Be a Reactionary Organization</p>
<p>Over Twenty People Arrested</p>
<p>At the Japanese-owned Yu Feng Spinning Mill on Yangshupu Road, a strike had previously occurred, and some workers rioted. The local police arrested over twenty of the ringleaders and handed them over to the First Special Court for punishment. At the same time, the police discovered that the workers had also formed an organization called the National Salvation Association, which was considered a reactionary organization. They began to arrest the key members of the association, successively arresting Wu Meiying, Wang Yunbin, Cheng Yuehua, Zhu Guifang, Qu Rujun, Wang Shouqing, Chen Hongdi, Yu Aizhen, Chen Gendi, Li Landi, Yu Guangqi, Tang Shoulin, Wu Zuochen, Cai Suhu, Zhou Shouyi, Yuan Qingwei, Zhu Pingjun, Gan Shuang, Zhang Liming, Cheng Siwen, and other men and women, a total of twenty people. A large number of reactionary books, documents, and letters were confiscated. They were handed over to the First Special District Court, requesting detention. Now, the police believe that the crimes committed by the defendants are all harmful to the Republic of China and should be tried in the first instance by the Second Branch of the High Court according to law. Therefore, yesterday morning, the suspects were escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Second Branch of the High Court, where Judge Nie Chongyi took the bench to investigate. The police lawyer, Gan Jingxian, prosecuted them according to Article 2 and Article 6 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China, Article 153 and Article 304 of the Criminal Law, requesting that they be punished according to law. After West Detective Kladen explained the organization of the association and the duties of each defendant, Judge Nie interrogated the defendants and ordered a postponement for further interrogation.</p>

<p>Gu Zhuxuan and Wang YuGao were convicted of inciting murder. The Second Special Court sentenced Gu to 15 years imprisonment, and Wang to life imprisonment. Gu and Wang, dissatisfied, appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. At the end of the trial, it was suddenly discovered that Gu Zhuxuan had bribed the overseers, inciting the prisoners Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Tinggui, also known as Zhang Xiaosizi, to recant their testimony. The overseers Ma Xianxiang, Ma Xiancai, and Wang Yushou fled with the money. After the Second Special Court Prosecutor Wang questioned them clearly, he filed a public prosecution with the Criminal Division of the same court. Judge Li Changnian questioned the various details, as reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, Third Branch of the High Court Judge Wang Yue opened the Fifth Investigation Court to investigate the accuser Zhang Tinggui, also known as Zhang Xiaosizi. The official asked Wang Xinggao if he knew him. Zhang replied that he did not know him, but only knew Wang Jinkui. When asked what Wang Jinkui looked like, he replied that he was shorter than me and had a dark complexion. When asked if there was such a thing as a bank savings passbook, he replied that there was. When asked who spoke to him about it first, he replied that it was the overseer Wang Yushou. When asked what he said, he replied that he said that he and Zhao Guangfu had already made arrangements and asked me to recant my testimony in the appellate court. At that time, I refused. Later, the overseer Ma Xianxiang came to me and told me about Gu Zhuxuan's case, saying that the police and the court had all been taken care of, and it was useless for me to bite him alone, so I should be a good person and take some money to use. Zhao Guangfu had already received 4,000 yuan. At this point, I agreed. I asked him how much money it was. He said 3,000 yuan, and he wanted a 500 yuan commission, so I would only get 2,500 yuan. At that time, I said to Ma that I had to have evidence before I could recant my testimony. Ma immediately agreed to deposit the money in the bank. I asked him whose account it was. He said that it could not be in my name, but in the name of Wang Chunhua. I replied that was fine. Later, on the day of the hearing, Ma showed me the deposit book outside the prison gate. Because it was too far away, I could not grab it. On January 4th (the date of Gu's appeal hearing) at 6 AM, Ma brought the deposit book again for me to look at. At this point, I grabbed the deposit book and inspected it. There was only 2,000 yuan in the account. When I asked him where the other 500 yuan was, he said that after the court session today, he would go to Gu's house tomorrow to get the money and seal and bring it to you. Ma also said that when you go to court today, you only need to say that Zhao Guangfu told you to come out to testify, but this deposit book cannot be kept by you, but must be kept by a third party. So, I gave it to Cao Shida, a fellow prisoner, for safekeeping. On the sixth, Ma Xianxiang and others took the remaining money and seal and fled. Therefore, I filed a complaint with the Third High Court.</p>
<p>The court ordered Zhang to be returned to custody.</p>

<p>Mother's Injuries Examined by Forensic Doctor</p>
<p>Unfilial Son Detained, Hearing Postponed</p>
<p>Tang Zhoushi, a 53-year-old woman from Guangdong and the proprietress of Lifeng Pawnshop at No. 271 Kaifeng Road, has a son named Tang Zhouli, 23 years old, who does not work and likes to be licentious, gambling all day long and visiting prostitutes. When he is penniless, he asks his mother for money. If she does not comply with his wishes, he resorts to rogue tactics, showing no respect for his elders and beating his mother. Recently, because he could not get money from his mother, he beat her again, injuring her arm. Tang Zhoushi, believing that her son was so disobedient that he could not be educated and had to be severely punished, filed a lawsuit for assault against her son Tang Zhouli with the First Special District Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide of the First Special Court opened a criminal court to summon both parties. Both the plaintiff and the defendant appeared in court. According to the plaintiff, the defendant often gambles and frequents prostitutes with others, and when I advised him against it, he beat me. Tang Zhouli denied beating his mother. Judge Feng, reviewing the statements, said that the plaintiff's injuries needed to be examined by a forensic doctor and that the defendant's behavior was inhumane. He ordered a postponement for further hearing and ordered Tang Zhouli to be detained.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Commodity Inspection Bureau Convenes a Discussion Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Stipulating the Quantity of Yellow Dye to Be Purchased in Various Regions</p>
<p>The Bureau Will Dispatch Personnel to Investigate and Guide Further Research</p>
<p>According to the Industry and Commerce News Agency, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, considering that the late spring season is approaching and new tea will soon be on the market, and in order to promote the improved yellow dye, convened a discussion meeting yesterday afternoon at 2 PM in the Bureau's conference room at New Garbage Bridge, gathering tea merchants from the city. In attendance were Bureau Chief Cai Wuji, Senior Technicians Wu Juenong and Zhou Zhenjun, as well as representatives from the Tea Manufacturing Trade Association Huang Zuyin, Peng Zhiping, Zheng Jianshen, and Yu Jinming, and representatives from the Tea Guild Hall Sun Zifu and Zhuo Huapu. Chairman Cai Wuji opened the meeting and briefly stated the purpose of the meeting, saying that the Yellow Dye Factory has not yet completed its contract and that merchants have been recruited to manage it. The goods already produced cannot be forcibly purchased. Therefore, the Tea Manufacturing Trade Association's request to recruit merchants to manage it separately is inconsistent with the original contract and should continue to be processed. He hoped that everyone would express their opinions to facilitate discussion on how to promote it in the future. Subsequently, Wu Juenong reported that, according to the sales quantity report of the Yellow Dye Factory, over 22,000 catties were sold in 1934, but less than 6,000 catties were sold in 1935. The reason why sales were not maximized in 1935 was that many tea companies did not help promote it. The Bureau had originally planned to have tea companies submit samples for inspection and register inland tea companies, and foreign merchants also hoped to inspect the tea before purchasing it. However, the Bureau, at the request of the tea companies, also believed that the blame for the coloring lay in the fact that the inland tea companies had not yet understood the truth, and it would be difficult to achieve universality without dispatching personnel for on-site guidance. However, the tea companies' inability to assist also created great difficulties in the process. Then, the discussion began on the method of promoting the yellow dye.</p>
<p>(Resolved) (A) It is stipulated that each household in Shanghai, Wenzhou, and Pingshui must purchase at least one dan, each household in Tunxi Yushan must purchase at least half a dan, and each household in Wuyuan and Suian must purchase at least twenty catties. Except for Yushan, which will be directly contacted by the Bureau to the county government, ordering tea companies to purchase it, the rest of the places will be distributed by each tea company to each household for trial use. If the trial use is not very satisfactory, each tea company or tea house can directly contact the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau for improvement. (B) Each tea company should be responsible for urging each tea house to purchase and use it, and the Bureau will send personnel to various places for investigation and guidance at any time. (C) The Bureau will invite Technician Tu to continue research. The meeting adjourned around 4 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e111">工部 Discusses Reducing Rickshaw Rental Fees: Rickshaw Businessmen Hold General Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Unanimous Resolution to Oppose</p>
<p>Rickshaw businessmen in this city, in order to oppose the reduction of rickshaw rental fees, held a general meeting of vehicle owners at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. More than 800 people attended, including Mao Guibao, Zhao Fengshan, Wang Kunyi, Yin Zhiling, Gu Songmao, Qin Zhihui, Ni Yuebo, Hou Shao'an, Lu Dexin, Zheng Jian San, Jiang Caicheng, Yin Zhifang, Bao Zhenhuang, Qiu Jixiang, Hu Hongxue, and Ding Youpeng. Mao Yun from the Municipal Party Headquarters and Li Ruzhang from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce were dispatched to provide guidance. The presidium consisted of Yin Zhiling, Gu Songmao, Hou Shao'an, Wang Kunyi, and Song Shixiang. The meeting commenced with customary rituals, beginning with Chairman Yin Zhiling reporting the purpose of the meeting. Subsequently, representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce delivered speeches.</p>
<p>Immediately after, the discussion began, and the following resolutions were passed:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, based on the recommendation of the Rickshaw Committee, intends to further reduce rickshaw rental fees by eight cents starting from April 1st, violating the agreement reached on August 6, 1934. How should we respond to this? (Resolution) Unanimously opposed and passed.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council unilaterally abolishes the August 6th Agreement and separately stipulates a daily rickshaw rental fee of seventy cents and a mandatory mutual aid fee of seven cents. How should we express our position on this? Resolution: (A) Public concession rickshaws are licensed by the Chinese, French, and British areas. The Shanghai Municipal Council should not overstep its authority to stipulate rickshaw rental fees, as this concerns national sovereignty and the regulations of various jurisdictions. This association finds it difficult to comply. (B) The Shanghai Municipal Council has the right to regulate passenger fares for public transportation businesses. However, the relationship between rickshaw owners and rickshaw pullers is a lease, which is not comparable to passengers and public buses. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council should not interfere with the rent agreements agreed upon by both rickshaw owners and pullers.</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association is purely a Chinese labor union and a mass organization. It should be guided by the Chinese Party Headquarters and not be taken over by foreigners. This concerns national sovereignty over the guidance of the people. Letters should be sent to the Shanghai Municipal Council for negotiation and submitted to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Headquarters for rectification. Furthermore, assistance in negotiation should be requested from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Ratepayers Association.</p>
<p>A letter from rickshaw puller representatives states that they will refuse to pay the mutual aid fee starting in April. How should this be handled? Resolution: (A) Send a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council requesting their attention. (B) Based on the obligation of each vehicle owner to collect and pay on behalf, since the payers have already declared a suspension of payment, this association will temporarily suspend payment on behalf until the payers re-express their intention to continue payment.</p>
<p>Donation and license fees for April: Resolution: Each vehicle owner should, before March 31st, deposit two yuan and nine cents per license at the bank designated by this association, awaiting negotiation and resolution for collective donation of licenses to show solidarity.</p>
<p>Rickshaw puller registration: The Rickshaw Committee disregards the agreement and arbitrarily restricts rickshaw puller registration, leading to the unemployment of more than 20,000 rickshaw pullers. For the past few months, each vehicle owner has been trying to maintain their livelihood. How should this be handled? Resolution: The Shanghai Municipal Council should be requested to register them as soon as possible so that they can pull rickshaws for a living, maintaining business and stabilizing society.</p>
<p>New rickshaw design modification proposal: Resolution: The new rickshaw design has been trialed for a year, and the results are poor. The Shanghai Municipal Council should be requested to modify and adopt it based on public vehicle standards to meet the needs of public vehicles.</p>
<p>The meeting adjourned after the discussions. A declaration was issued, the text of which is omitted for brevity.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Searching for Husband for Thirteen Years: Meeting Leads to New Love for Him. Plaintiff's Lawyer States Similar to Meng Jiangnu's Long Journey to Find Husband.  Nan Asks for Mediation on Cohabitation and Monthly Alimony. <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Wu Wang, a woman from Fujian, recently engaged lawyer Jia Yaoxi to file a lawsuit in the Second Special Court's Civil Division, accusing her husband, Wu Fuguan (currently residing at No. 42, Fengyu Lane, Sapse Road), of bigamy, adultery, and abandonment. She requested mediation. The gist of her lawsuit is as follows: The petitioner married the defendant in her hometown at the age of seventeen. At that time, the couple's feelings were very good. Because they were childless, they adopted Wu Gengmin as their son according to Fujian custom. He is now fifteen years old. When Gengmin was one year old, the defendant left home to do business and borrowed several hundred yuan from his mother to go to Shanghai. Since then, he has never returned, disappearing without a trace for thirteen years. During this time, the petitioner brought her son to Shanghai several times, leaving her hometown and enduring hardships in search of him, but to no avail. It was not until last winter that a fellow villager pointed out the defendant's residence. She then learned that the defendant had a formal new lover in Shanghai. After entering the house, she was confined to the attic and treated like a servant. The defendant often spoke harshly and quarreled with her. When he was occasionally displeased, he would insult her indirectly and mock her coldly and sarcastically, indicating a complete break in their relationship. It is undeniable that the law stipulates that a married couple should have only one husband and one wife, and they have a mutual obligation to cohabit. Now that the defendant has taken another lover and disregards his first wife, and after thirteen years, abandons her like worn shoes upon reunion, she requests that the case be summoned for mediation, ordering the defendant to sever his relationship with his new lover immediately, resume cohabitation with the petitioner, and pay monthly alimony of 200 yuan. At the same time, she requests permission to reserve the petitioner's right to criminally prosecute the defendant for abandonment and bigamy.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the court summoned them. First, the petitioner's lawyer stated the past events, saying that the defendant's business in Shanghai is very good, accumulating assets of hundreds of thousands of gold, yet his wife is like Meng Jiangnu, who traveled thousands of miles to find her husband, but was abandoned after reunion. He asked for a fair judgment. The defendant did not appear. Lawyer Xi Shichang stated that the defendant could agree to cohabitation, but could not accept the other conditions. As for the current cohabiting woman, she is in the status of a concubine. Judge Guo instructed that the mediation was unsuccessful, and the petitioner should file another lawsuit.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Lawyers Association Submits to the Land Court, Requesting Improvement in Reporting and Execution Procedures <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association submitted a document to the Shanghai Land Court yesterday, stating that it was submitting the document to improve the procedures for pre-trial reporting, in-court rescheduling, and execution of seizures and appraisals, following the procedures of the Shanghai First Special District Land Court. According to a proposal by member Xu Zuoliang, "The Shanghai First Special District Land Court has improved procedures for parties to report for pre-trial hearings. Parties report to the court during the hearing, and if the court deems it necessary to reschedule, it designates a date in court and no longer issues summonses to parties who have already reported. Also, execution of seizure cases often involves the clerk executing two or three cases on the same day. When seizing real estate worth less than 100 yuan, the clerk and bailiff immediately appraise the value. This method has been practiced for a long time without any hindrance or abuse. The Shanghai Land Court should follow suit to save time and other procedures. This is analyzed and explained below: Reporting in court can save the time of the bailiff on duty handling the execution. The judge can also observe whether the parties have arrived on time. Designating a retrial date in court can save the procedures and time for drafting and serving summonses, and it can also allow the parties who have arrived to prepare in advance, making it convenient for them to travel far or arrive on time. The reason why seizure events are time-consuming is often due to the debtor's reconciliation or hesitation in raising funds. To save time, the courts in the First and Second Special Districts require a dedicated clerk to schedule one or two cases with nearby addresses on the same date for joint execution. For example, in Case A, the debtor of Case A is kept at the debtor's premises to reconcile with the creditor or order the debtor to raise funds, and handle procedures such as checking property. At the same time, go to the debtor of Case B and do the same. Then go to the debtor of the inner case. Finally, return to Case B and Case A to see how they are raising funds or reconciling. If there is no way, the bailiff has completed all the seizure procedures, and the clerk can immediately supervise the seizure. Time and legal facts are not hindered. When the amount seized is less than 100 yuan, the appraisal is done on the same day to avoid delaying the date due to the appraisal, which will harm both the creditor and the debtor. The principle is very clear. It is requested that the Shanghai Land Court immediately adopt and improve the procedures to facilitate litigation." The resolution of the Joint Meeting of the 220th Executive Supervisory Committee of the Association was to forward it to your court for approval and implementation. It is a public convenience.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Traveling Around the World: British Giant Ship Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Carrying an American Travel Group of 387 People; After Landing, More Than 100 Cars Take to See Shanghai</p>
<p>The "Queen Empress," a giant ship of the British Chang Dian Company circumnavigating the globe, arrived in Shanghai at 1:55 PM yesterday and berthed in the waters of Sanjia, outside the Wusongkou. The American travel group traveling on the ship, a total of 387 people, transferred to the company's passenger ship at 4:05 PM and landed at the new customs pier. One hundred and seven Yunfei cars took them on a tour of the city and the downtown area. Except for twelve people who stayed in Shanghai to take the train to Peiping, the rest returned to the original ship, scheduled to sail to Qinhuangdao at 11:00 AM today.</p>
<p>Delayed Due to Fog, Anchored at Sanjia</p>
<p>The ship departed from New York on January 13th, crossing the Atlantic Ocean and passing through the Maltese Islands, Bombay, Colombo, Penang, Bangkok, Singapore, Java, and Luzon. It arrived in Hong Kong on the 24th of this month and continued sailing to Shanghai the next day. Changxing Company received a telegram from the ship the day before, saying that it would arrive in Shanghai at 6:00 AM yesterday, so the company set off from the new customs pier at 4:30 AM yesterday with two passenger ships, "Alexander" and "Smith," and sailed to Wusongkou. A reporter from the East China News Agency rushed to the new customs pier at night to board the Smith to visit and take news photos (see circle). When the reporter arrived at the pier at 4:00 AM, it was drizzling. The two passenger ships set off on time and arrived at the sea off Wusongkou at 5:40 AM. The sky was already dawning, but there was no sign of the "Queen Empress". The British manager and Chinese director Li Quan of Changxing Company instructed the shipowner to continue forward, and arrived at the waters of Sanjia at 6:15 AM, but still no trace. So at 6:20 AM, they sailed back to Wusong and wired the company to inquire, only to learn that the "Queen Empress" had encountered fog midway and would arrive at 2:30 PM. Everyone then looked for a way to land and rest. The two passenger ships also waited on the Jiangmian River at the Quarantine Office.</p>
<p>Group Members Land and Tour Shanghai</p>
<p>At 1:00 PM, the two passenger ships set off again to the outside of the mouth. At 1:40 PM, the giant ship appeared in front of them and anchored at Sanjia waters at 1:55 PM. After the passenger ship docked with the giant ship, the police chief of the Public Security Bureau boarded the ship to check passports. Then, the members of the travel group, a total of 387 people, and seven other passengers, who were traveling around the world on the giant ship, stepped into the small boat to Shanghai. When they arrived at the new customs pier at 4:05 PM, they changed to 107 Yunfei cars parked outside the door and drove away one after another.</p>
<p>Tea Dance at the Cathay Hotel</p>
<p>A row of cars went in two lanes. Fifty of them went to Nanshi, Yimiao, the French Concession, Zhaofeng Garden, and the Zhabei city street, directly to the downtown area, to visit the new Shanghai buildings. Fifty-seven of them went to the downtown area first, then to Zhabei, Zhaofeng Garden, and then to the city. At 6:00 PM, they returned to the Cathay Hotel. At 7:00 PM, they had dinner at the hotel. At 9:00 PM, Chang and Company specially hosted a tea dance at the Cathay Hotel ballroom to entertain all the members.</p>
<p>Leaving Shanghai for Qinhuangdao This Afternoon</p>
<p>The tea dance ended at 10:30 PM with joy. A part of the members boarded the Smith passenger ship, which set off from the new customs at 11:00 PM, to return to the original ship. Twelve people opened rooms at the Cathay Hotel to stay in Shanghai, waiting to take the Shanghai-Peiping train, which departed at 4:00 PM this afternoon, to Peiping. The rest of the members returned to the original ship by passenger ship at 2:00 AM and 8:30 AM this morning. According to Li Quan of Changxing Company, the "Queen Empress" is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 11:00 AM today (28th) and sail to Qinhuangdao, passing through famous cities in various countries, including Qinhuangdao, Osaka, Kobe, Yokohama, Wenwo, San Francisco, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Havana, and other ports, and returning to New York around the 14th of next month.</p>
<p>The Whole Ship is Exquisitely Constructed</p>
<p>Li Quan of the East China News Agency, under the guidance of Li Quan of Chang Company, once boarded the ship to visit for a week. The ship's appearance is white, and the three smokestacks are orange-yellow. The part below the waterline is green. The ship is 1,050 feet high, and looks like a 15-story building when viewed from below. According to Li, this ship was built in 1930 and was launched by Queen Mary of England. This is the second time it has come to China. The first time it crossed China was last spring. The ship is 759 feet long, 97.5 feet wide, has a displacement of 63,750 tons, and a load of 42,500 tons. It is equipped with three engines, which can generate 64,400 horsepower at the same time. The speed is 24.5 nautical miles per hour. Sailing on the ocean, it is not afraid of hurricanes and huge waves. The whole ship has a total of eleven floors. From the lowest floor to the eighth floor, there are three elevators. The ninth floor has two sports fields and tennis courts, as well as a cinema, music room, gym, barber shop, medical room, beauty salon, children's playground, and other facilities, which are very exquisite. You can ride a bicycle freely in the corridors of the ship. The greatness of the construction can be seen from this.</p>

<p>Respectfully, upon reading your newspaper's local news section, it was reported that our company, at around 11:00 AM yesterday, suffered an accident in which a rickshaw puller was burned to death on the spot due to the negligence of a driver causing a gasoline explosion, and that gasoline was stored indoors. We hereby submit this letter to request a correction. There was no burning to death on the spot, and there was no gasoline stored indoors. All gasoline is dispensed at the American-style gasoline pump installed at our company's entrance. The incident involved a silversmith apprentice and two coppersmiths who were cooking together using a kerosene stove. Unexpectedly, the kerosene stove exploded, severely injuring one coppersmith and slightly injuring the other. They are currently residing at the Nanyang Hospital. The apprentice was not injured. We request a correction to this effect.</p>

<p>— Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Internal retention of wind-dampness and residual toxins entering the bones initially manifests as soreness and pain in the joints. If treatment is delayed, it worsens, developing into numbness in the limbs. In more severe cases, it leads to hemiplegia or complete paralysis, resulting in a loss of freedom of movement, equivalent to being disabled.</p>
<p>Last autumn, a patient named Liang Yi came to me complaining of wind-dampness, bone pain, and numbness in his hands and feet, etc., for which he had tried various treatments without success. After examination, I determined that Mr. Liang's condition was caused by residual toxins that had not been completely eliminated. I instructed him to purchase and take "Strong Stone's Bone Pain Tablets" from the Western medicine department of Wing On Company to dispel wind-dampness and search out residual toxins. He immediately felt relief in his joints, and his hands and feet became more agile. After taking several boxes, he achieved a complete cure with remarkable effect. He departed happily and gratefully.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Happy Smoking Cessation, Radical Cure for Stomach Pain <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>I have statistically observed that among those quitting smoking, seven or eight out of ten also complain of stomach pain. If the stomach pain is not radically cured first, the task of safely quitting smoking cannot be fully accomplished.</p>
<p>However, since the sources of stomach pain are varied, medication should not be limited to one approach. The key is to reduce inflammation and acidity, protect the lining, and promote tissue regeneration, while also relieving pain and spasms. If these are supplemented with agents that strengthen and nourish the stomach, appetite will increase, digestion will be promoted, and a weakened stomach can recover its health.</p>
<p>Recently, a Mr. Ma Jitang suffered from long-standing stomach problems that he considered incurable. He was only compelled to quit due to his smoking addiction. Last month, he came to me for help with quitting. I instructed him to purchase "Stomach Pain Relief" from the French-Chinese Pharmacy to address the root cause of his stomach problems, and "Stomach Strengthening Pills" to strengthen his stomach. To remove nicotine poisoning and break the smoking habit, he took "Germinal Essence", which strengthens the body and treats illness. After taking it, he felt happy and, due to the radical cure of his stomach pain, Mr. Ma was extremely pleased. He successfully quit smoking in just four weeks.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Abdominal Pain and Leukorrhea <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Bofu</p>
<p>In women, the lower abdomen is the location of the uterus. Sensations of pain are generally caused by uterine inflammation. If left untreated, irregular menstruation and leukorrhea (white vaginal discharge) will occur in succession, leading to multiple illnesses and ailments.</p>
<p>A patient, Ms. Zou, was introduced to me last autumn by her friend, Ms. Tang. She complained of abdominal pain during menstruation and leukorrhea. Upon examination, I determined that she suffered from uterine inflammation. I instructed her to purchase "Female Germinal Essence" from Wu Zhou Pharmacy to reduce inflammation, warm the uterus, regulate menstruation, and treat leukorrhea. To expedite her recovery, I also prescribed the external application of "Leukorrhea Relief". With internal and external treatments combined for half a month, she regained her health and youth. She happily thanked me before departing.</p>

<h3 id="e131">How to Quit Smoking for Seminal Emission Sufferers <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>Seminal emission and smoking cessation are two entirely separate matters, yet they share a common hardship: mental fatigue.</p>
<p>Those who suffer from seminal emission may experience insomnia, frequent dreams, palpitations, poor memory, or mental distraction. Upon waking after an emission, they may feel dizzy, regretful, dejected, and pessimistic. Those quitting smoking experience an abrupt change in habits and a sudden physiological shift, as if transported to another world. They cannot sit or stand still; their laughter and tears are inappropriate. Their mental anguish is akin to heartbreak. Even those with great determination and a resolve to quit often long for and are reluctant to part with tobacco.</p>
<p>Therefore, the key to quitting smoking lies in alleviating the quitter's mental suffering. "Germinal Essence" is praised by those who have quit for its efficacy in detoxifying and breaking addiction. Its ability to invigorate the mind and ensure a safe and pleasant experience is greatly valued. Last month, I treated a patient, Bian Jichuan, for seminal emission with "Himrod's Spermatorrhea Tablets" and safely broke his smoking habit with "Germinal Essence," providing irrefutable proof.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Wind-Damp Bone Pain Turned into Paralysis <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Last autumn, a wealthy gentleman from my hometown, Mr. Wang Xinggao, suffered from wind-dampness during his youth, leading to soreness and pain in his joints. Repeated treatments were ineffective, and after years of neglect, he became paralyzed. I examined him and instructed him to purchase and take "Strong Stone's Bone Pain Tablets" from the Huamei Pharmacy. After taking them, he felt immediate relief and comfort in his joints and tendons. After several consultations, he was able to get out of bed. He continued to take several boxes and achieved a complete cure. He recently came to my office to thank me and presented a plaque.

<p>(A letter from Mr. Li Yongchang of Anqing states:) Because I indulged in excessive masturbation during my youth, I subsequently suffered from seminal emission and premature ejaculation. Repeated medical treatments yielded little effect. Delaying treatment only worsened my condition. Last autumn, I saw in this journal that someone with the same condition as mine was cured by Dr. Zhan Nianceng with the famous medicines "Himrod's Spermatorrhea Tablets" and "Germinal Essence". I also wrote to the Shanghai Chinese-English Pharmacy to order three boxes of each. Because the effects were remarkable after taking them, I continued taking them for another three boxes, totaling half a dozen. Now, not only have both conditions been completely cured, but I am also full of vitality, strong, and healthy. My vitality has been restored, and I have regained my youth, as if reborn.</p>

<p>(A letter from Mr. Chen of Weihaiwei Road in this city states:) I was born with insufficient endowment, and improper care further harmed me. As a result, I did not develop properly during my developmental years. Later, my body became weak, and I was plagued by constant illnesses. Countless treatments and supplements all proved disappointing. Last year, as I turned thirty, relatives and friends came to celebrate. However, when I looked at myself in the mirror, I was saddened to see that I appeared to be around forty. My close friend, Mr. Xiao Zhiliang, knowing my distress, gifted me half a dozen boxes of the famous medicine "Germinal Essence". I took it according to instructions. After taking it, my blood was enriched, my spirit was boosted, my muscles became fuller, and I regained development and youth. Therefore, I am deeply grateful and often gift "Germinal Essence" to others so that they too may enjoy health and strength.</p>

<p>(A letter from Mr. Yang Dunyi states:) I used to be strong and healthy, excelling among my peers. However, due to improper health maintenance and irregular eating habits, I often experienced indigestion. As my appetite diminished, my weight decreased, my muscles became emaciated, and my spirit became weakened. (Excerpt) Later, after reading this journal, I learned that "Stomach Strengthening Pills" were an effective remedy for my condition. I purchased them from the Taihe Pharmacy and took them according to instructions. After taking them, my digestive power felt greatly enhanced, and my appetite immediately increased. With sufficient nutrient intake, my muscles regained development, and my weight steadily increased, exceeding my former peak weight by as much as fifteen pounds.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club on Conly Road is the only complete grass court in Shanghai. It was originally established by the National Sports Federation. Two years ago, due to the landlord reclaiming the land, Qiu Feihai continued to operate it. Due to poor management, it was forced to close last winter. However, it has been found that the exorbitant land tax requires a rent of around 2,000 yuan per year. With the addition of equipment and other expenses, even with the membership fees paid by the members, it was only enough to cover the expenses. Therefore, after Mr. Qiu's contract expired, no one was willing to take over. It would be a pity to let such a good venue go to waste. After discussions between the National Sports Federation and the Chinese Athletic Association on Hardoon Road, it was decided to jointly fund the club to maintain the grass tennis courts in Shanghai and to provide convenience for tennis enthusiasts. This will promote the development of tennis. The club has been renamed the Conly Athletic Club (Conly Athletic Club).

<p>Resulting in Only a Slight Increase of Thirty Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was unprecedentedly quiet, with only over two thousand transactions taking place throughout the day.</p>

<p>silver was quoted down by 1 Anna. Although Zhuanxiang and Shen Dayong purchased, floating accounts delayed until</p>
<p>closing, remaining at 1146.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The closing price was posted at the Central Bank's standard gold price, rising to</p>

<p>the process was still stable. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's posted prices were announced, with both the British and American markets remaining flat.</p>
<p>At this time, prices hovered. The silver equalization tax contracted by one cent, but it also lacked much</p>
<p>stimulation. However, Western merchant Sassoon blocked the recent shillings, while banks still maintained</p>
<p>their purchases, causing the overall trend to fluctuate again. At midday, banks released American</p>
<p>dollars, causing a slight relaxation. In the after-market, banks slightly traded shillings, and the process was stable.</p>

<p>Securities</p>
<p>Public Bond Deliveries in March Greatly Reduced</p>
<p>Yesterday, March 27th, was the settlement date for March</p>
<p>futures at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. The small amount of deliveries</p>
<p>was unprecedented. The total amount was 4.44 million, of which 96 accounted for 3.055 million,</p>
<p>full length 45,000, and unified public bonds A and B totaled only 1.16 million. Most were</p>
<p>settlements for small retail investors. Since the reforms, all old bonds</p>
<p>have been suspended from trading on the market. Of the five types of unified public bonds, only A and B</p>
<p>had been exchanged before settlement. The other three types, C, D, and E, had not yet reached the exchange period, so they could not be traded as</p>
<p>March futures. Types A and B totaled 300 million, and</p>
<p>the actual amount delivered was only over 1 million. Moreover, since the financial sector experienced</p>
<p>the turmoil of the previous decision and major reforms, it has become wary, fearing that it would be easy to enter but difficult to exit, repeating</p>
<p>the previous pattern. The financial sector's wait-and-see attitude has also made it impossible for speculators</p>
<p>to get involved, and trading has sharply decreased. The exchange is increasingly deserted. Looking back on the past,</p>
<p>one cannot help but feel a sense of vicissitude. People's minds are scattered, and the market situation is declining. If there are no major changes in the environment</p>
<p>in April, it will not be easy to have hope for a thriving trade.</p>
<p>Since unified public bonds began trading as futures on February 28th,</p>
<p>excluding holidays, there have been only 24 trading days. In March, only types A and B</p>
<p>were traded. During these 24 days, the total number of transactions was only 3.85 million, which is rare.</p>
<p>Regarding the changes in market prices, on the first day of trading on February 28th,</p>
<p>after the previous turmoil, people's minds were extremely weak, and selling was extremely strong.</p>
<p>In one day, from morning to night, prices fell by about two yuan. After that, prices gradually recovered.</p>
<p>The highest price for type A was 66.5 yuan on March 9th, and the highest price for type B was 65.21 yuan on February 3rd. Compared to the lowest price</p>
<p>on February 28th, type A differed by 3.1 yuan, and type B differed by 3.7 yuan.</p>
<p>After this sharp drop and sudden rise, prices tended to fluctuate slightly, with minimal ups and downs, and trading was extremely</p>
<p>light. Although there were difficulties in Sino-Japanese negotiations, rumors of autonomy in Fujian Province, and disputes over the Rhine River</p>
<p>between Germany and France, the market seemed to be unaffected and had absolutely no hope.</p>
<p>The hopeless 96 public bonds, on the other hand, had a period of unjustified increase, from</p>
<p>9.2 yuan to 12.2 yuan, which shows that speculators felt that there was no way to go.</p>
<p>Since then, trading has become light, and most have turned to other exchanges. Therefore,</p>
<p>it will not be possible to reverse the fate of the securities market in the short term. The number of March futures deliveries</p>
<p>and clearings are listed below separately (unit: 100 yuan):</p>
<p>Sudden Surge of Longs Emerging</p>
<p>New York Stocks See Slight Rebound</p>
<p>Xinfeng Yanghang reported that yesterday (26th) the New York stock market was calm in the morning,</p>
<p>with prices trending upward. In the last hour, however, a sudden surge of longs emerged,</p>
<p>causing a slight rebound. As a result, prices were mixed and slightly lower. Speculators waited for the response</p>
<p>to the new margin requirements and the clarification of the European situation, mostly watching from the sidelines. Therefore,</p>
<p>selling was not spectacular. Railroad stocks were still able to maintain most of the gains made in the morning.</p>
<p>Automobile stocks, on the other hand, fell back to the previous day's closing level. Air conditioning stocks were in very high demand.</p>
<p>Small exchange stocks were stagnant and slightly higher. The bond market saw a selling spree at the end, and prices were slightly lower.</p>
<p>The total volume of trading for the day was 1.87 million shares. The Dow Jones New York index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>Fleeting Rise in Yarn Prices</p>
<p>—Spot Yarn Advances Again to the Five Yuan Mark—</p>
<p>The yarn market advanced in the morning and retreated in the afternoon, with the momentum slightly softening. The real reason was that after the big</p>
<p>gains the day before, there were still no developments in customer sales, prompting profitable longs</p>
<p>to sell. He Xing also came to short sell, and the trading floor became slack, and the market entered a</p>
<p>fatigued path again. However, the banking sector and gold merchants still occupied long positions.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Initial Increase and Decline</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot yarn market, the prices for each month uniformly jumped</p>
<p>high. At the opening, due to the previous day's big players vigorously shorting, the number of chips was tight,</p>
<p>and people's minds were good, so they moved forward. But after the second session, news came that spot yarn trading</p>
<p>still had no hope of improving, and the longs gradually sold, and the market slightly returned. As a result,</p>
<p>each month rose by four, five, and six cents compared to the previous day's closing price. At the opening in the afternoon,</p>
<p>the situation was still good due to Osaka Sanpin Yarn's transfer of one yuan, but later the</p>

<p>On the Cotton Market, the previous day's sharp rise, now overseas materials must still be mediocre, and</p>
<p>the yarn market is also showing a hesitant appearance. At the same time, the spot cotton mills need to</p>
<p>stop, and the longs take profits and exit, so the market falls. Except for the August period, all knocked through the five yuan mark.</p>

<p>falling 1.2 cents. In the second session, the near end returned to flat, and the far end was tighter. By the time of the three-session</p>
<p>close, it was heard that foreign long positions were settling and falling back, and as a result, each month fell by five cents to 1.1 cents compared to the previous day's closing price.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the opening near end was still firm, rising 1 cent, and after the second session, the market state turned lazy due to the weakness of the yarn market, and April, May,</p>

<p>Within Liaoning Province</p>
<p>Progress of Enslavement Education:</p>
<p>The Future of National Thought is Lamentable</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from the Northeast News Agency, Shenyang) Currently, education in various parts of the Northeast has been completely Japanized. Among various courses, Japanese language and literature are the most emphasized, to the point where it seems one cannot have a meal without understanding Japanese. Northeastern youths, receiving this education, are increasingly developing a servile nature while their nationalistic thinking is diminishing daily. The future is truly deplorable. Here is a record of the Shenyang Japanese cultural promotion situation:</p>
<p>Pseudo-Fengtian Municipal Public Office Education</p>
<p>Shenyang Pro-Japanese Education: The Education Department of the Pseudo-Fengtian Municipal Public Office, in order to have teachers in municipal primary schools promote Japanese culture, selects pro-Japanese teachers to study in Japan every year. This year, even more effort will be put into Japanese culture by employing many excellent Japanese teachers and assigning them to various schools to establish a policy of enslavement education and anesthetic teaching methods.</p>
<p>Liaoyang Japanese Language School</p>
<p>In the year of Taisho 2 (1913), Liaoyang County hired Shigematsu Masui as a consultant for the Liaoyang Japanese Language School. He specifically established a night school in Yixue Hutong, south of the city, which has lasted for twenty-three years. According to the Japanese propaganda, if one knows Japanese, one can study all aspects of Japan. Moreover, now that "Manchukuo" and Japan are inseparable, graduates of the Japanese language school are achieving great success in all fields. The Japanese language school currently operated by the South Manchuria Railway is the predecessor of this night school. This year's graduates number over a hundred, and before graduation, suitable employment positions have already been secured. From this, one can deeply understand the Japanese method of winning over and anesthetizing young students.</p>
<p>This Year's Fujian Province</p>
<p>Education as the Central Task of Administration</p>
<p>(Dispatch from Fuzhou, 26th) Fujian Province has decided to make education the central task of administration this year. Chairman Chen has ordered commissioners and county heads in all districts that, henceforth, regarding education funding, the province will do its best to plan, and all districts and counties should strive to promote it. He also expressed intentions to improve the treatment of teacher union members and educational administrative personnel.</p>
<p>Hubei Province Compulsory Education</p>
<p>Report from the Ministry of Education's Special Commissioner, Zhen Sheng</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued an instruction to the Hubei Provincial Department of Education on the 26th, stating: "Based on the inspection report of Yang Zhensheng, the special commissioner hired by the Ministry for inspection, it has been found that the province's implementation of compulsory education still has areas that need improvement. Instructions are hereby given as follows:</p>
<p>There are many private schools in the province, enrolling over 200,000 children. Their influence is almost equal to that of primary schools in the province. In areas where there are no primary schools, their existence is indeed beneficial and can be tolerated. However, in areas implementing compulsory education, they actually hinder the promotion of new education. Efforts should be made to utilize and supervise their improvement. Those that are more complete should be converted into substitute primary schools. The department has a plan for training teachers in private schools, which was implemented in the previous year and is crucial. Efforts should be intensified to order all counties to focus on the training of teachers in private schools. During this year's summer vacation, those who can be trained should be included in the teacher training program as much as possible. Those that cannot be improved or do not accept training should be banned immediately, and the original students should be transferred to short-term primary schools or joint security primary schools. The number of public ordinary primary schools in the province is too small. In addition to encouraging private individuals to establish schools, joint security primary schools should be established according to the interim measures for establishing primary schools by joint security in the counties of the province. The schools should be converted into ordinary primary schools or simplified primary schools within ten years. The primary schools in cities such as Wuhan in the province are still insufficient to accommodate the majority of children, and the number of children out of school remains high. Expansion should be assisted and a two-shift system should be rigorously implemented to accommodate more students. Special education in the province is well-managed. Such educational measures should not be limited to recovered areas but should be promoted to a wider range. Adult classes should be opened in existing short-term primary schools and gradually expanded. The two hundred and forty short-term primary schools planned to be established have now all been established and should be reported for the record. The funding for short-term primary schools was discounted by 85% in the first half of the 24th year. It has been stated that starting from January of the 25th year, there will be no discounts, and the full amount is currently being issued. This should be reported for verification as soon as possible. The school buildings of most schools are simple and inadequate, and because they are old and in disrepair, they do not provide shelter from wind and rain. The department should establish a plan for renovating school buildings, prioritizing them according to urgency and renovating or repairing them annually, and not allow them to collapse or even pose a danger of collapse. All of the above should be complied with accordingly. This is an order from the Ministry of Education."</p>

<p>Guidelines for Cooperation Between Vocational Schools and Construction Organizations Defined by the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has defined guidelines for cooperation between vocational schools and construction organizations, as reported yesterday. The guidelines are listed below: Vocational schools should agree with the internship organization on a detailed plan and work procedure for students' internships, and should strive to ensure that off-campus internships are closely related to the training received at school. Off-campus internships for vocational school students should be limited to senior students, and the internship time may be concentrated for convenience. During off-campus internships, the internship organization should designate personnel to provide guidance. If necessary, the school may provide a stipend, but the teacher who originally taught the internship course should be responsible for participating in the guidance to facilitate communication. If the cost of internship materials required for off-campus internships is too high, the school should bear part or all of the cost. At the end of the student's off-campus internship, the guiding personnel of the internship organization should summarize and evaluate the internship performance and grades of each student separately and submit them to the school for inclusion in the academic record.</p>

<p>Jiang Dayi Lecture</p>
<p>The Cultural Era of the Wangbi Mountain Site (Part 1)</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang Dayi lectured at Cuiying Middle School in Suzhou the day before yesterday, entitled "The Era of the Wangbi Mountain Site Culture." The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, I am very honored to have the opportunity to gather with you all today. Originally, Mr. Jin Songcen and the principal of this school invited me to come here last Friday afternoon. However, things did not go as planned. On that afternoon, I had already arranged to meet several friends from Shanghai to investigate ancient sites on Tiger Hill. They all hold positions at the school, and Friday is not a holiday, but they specially took leave to come to Suzhou. Therefore, I had to accompany them, and had to postpone my time here until today. I am very sorry to all of you, and I must first sincerely apologize to you.</p>
<p>Mr. Jin Songcen and the principal of this school invited me to come here, but in reality, I am unlearned and have nothing to offer you. However, the two gentlemen's kindness should not be disappointed. Therefore, I forget my ignorance and am willing to present the issue of 'The Era of the Wangbi Mountain Site Culture' here for discussion with you all.</p>
<p>The location of the site: On November 24th of last year, Mr. Cao Huadan and I found a Wangbi Mountain cultural site located in the southwest outside of Suzhou City, about eight or nine li away from the city, near the town of Xinguo. The site is located on the northeast corner of Stone Lake, belonging to the 24th image of Yidu in the old Wu territory. A main road runs horizontally through the middle of the site, called Xingchun Bridge Street, which is the thoroughfare leading directly to Xinguo Town. Another main road surrounds the southwest of the site, which can lead to Lishu Town. Rivers surround the northwest of the site, which can lead to boats. On the south side of the site, there is a very poetic residence, which is the property of Mr. Yu Bingrenjue. According to Mr. Li Yinquan's research, this place should be the former site of Tianjing Pavilion in Fan Chengda's Stone Lake Villa of the Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>To the west of the site, there is a high bridge called Yuecheng Bridge, which is the Yuelaixi Bridge recorded in the Wu Junzhi. The river under the bridge, connected to the Stone Lake water, is the Hengtang River, which is the North Yuelaixi of the classics. To the west of Yuecheng Bridge, there is a long bridge lying on Stone Lake, which is our famous Xingchun Bridge in Suzhou. On the eighth month of the lunar calendar, everyone goes to Stone Lake to watch the moon, which is in this place. Crossing Xingchun Bridge, you have reached the west bank of Stone Lake. Along the bank are small mountains such as Mopan Mountain and Shangfang Mountain. These small mountains are all small peaks northeast of the Seven Sons Mountain. In ancient times, the Seven Sons Mountain was called Hengshan. These Mopan Mountain and Shangfang Mountain peaks did not have independent names at that time, and were collectively called Hengshan. (See Wang Wenke's Gusu Zhi for proof) Therefore, from the ancient place name, this site is east of Heng Mountain, if just the main peak, then one can say its at the northeast side of the foot of the Heng Mountain.</p>

<p>The school's disciplinary and pastoral measures can be divided into two aspects: positive and negative. On the positive side, the school emphasizes the influence of teachers' personality and indirect suggestion. According to the school principal's opinion, although the school's teachers have the dignity of teachers, they have never used this dignity to oppress or subdue students. The school's teachers often use the method of personality influence to enhance the friendly relationship between teachers and students, so that students can have automatic awareness in the melting of the teachers' personality, and can automatically improve their behavior. The so-called indirect suggestion refers to promoting the improvement of student behavior through environmental pressure and group sanctions. For example, a newly admitted student is not clean in terms of body and clothing; the school authorities do not immediately train this student to be clean in body and clothing. However, after the student joins the school environment, he will unconsciously feel that his unclean body and clothes cannot adapt to this clean environment, so he will automatically improve. If he is in this environment and still has no automatic feeling, then other students will give him an indication, or even notify him that he must have some improvement; otherwise, the group will despise him or reject him. Therefore, he is in this good group life, under the pressure of the environment and the sanctions of the group, he must correct his personal behavior to adapt to the environment.</p>
<p>As for the negative disciplinary measures, the school usually uses the method of demerits. For example, if a student is late several times, he will be given several small demerits. After accumulating a certain number of small demerits, certain rights will be deprived; this deprivation of rights will not hinder his physical and mental health and academic work. If he can correct his mistakes, the deprived rights can be restored, so that he can have the opportunity to reform himself. If a student commits a serious mistake, the principal will study the problem child in detail and give appropriate solutions or punishments. When necessary, the principal can use corporal punishment, suspension, expulsion, and other severe punishments to deal with stubborn students. However, according to the school principal's report, these severe punishment methods are rarely used.</p>

<h3 id="e154">The Financial Situation Over the Past Year (6) <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— He Boxiong</p>
<p>Upon examination, the government's announced equalization taxes over the past year can be divided into two periods. The first is before the promulgation of the new currency law on November 3rd of last year, and the second is after the promulgation of the new currency law on November 3rd. Before the promulgation of the new currency law, the equalization tax was not levied according to established rules. After it came into effect on November 4th, the equalization tax announced by the government was not only no less than the theoretically expected equalization tax, but often exceeded it. Consider the table below: (Note 10)</p>
<p>Therefore, before November 10th, there was still a significant profit to be made from shipping silver from Shanghai to London. The net profit from exporting every hundred yuan, after deducting freight, could range from about twenty-six yuan to about forty-one yuan. The government did not completely restrict the export of silver through equalization taxes. As a result, as of the end of January of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the silver reserves of Shanghai banks only totaled 335 million yuan, a decrease of over 225 million yuan compared to the same period last year. Compared to the highest point in the 22nd year (1933), the decrease was nearly 300 million yuan. At the end of February, there was a further decrease of over 2.1 million yuan compared to the previous month, and at the end of March, there was another decrease of over 9 million yuan compared to the end of February. In April and May, there were slight increases, while in June, the reserves were slightly low, mainly because it was the peak season for wheat sales in the interior, and also because it was approaching the Dragon Boat Festival, and money was extremely tight in various places, requiring cash. Therefore, in that month, silver dollars were slightly transferred to the interior. In July and August, because the autumn harvest of inland products was approaching, the need for cash was particularly urgent, and 4 to 5 million yuan was transferred out in the two months, with 2.4 million yuan sent to Hankou, and about 500,000 yuan each to Beijing, Tianjin, and other places. From September to November, there were cash inflows, mainly because Shanghai's financial situation was becoming more stable, exchange rates were narrowing, and foreign silver prices were not rising as sharply as before. Therefore, the cash previously shipped for export was gradually being returned. However, the percentage of total reserves held by Chinese banks was still much higher than that of foreign banks.

<h3 id="e155">Japanese Women's Views on Occupations <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Yifa</p>
<p>Japanese women, produced under the educational method of "good wives and wise mothers," naturally have their own characteristics. They have only reached occupational equality with men and have not yet taken the step of participating in politics. In the past, Japanese women only engaged in lower-level occupations such as maids and geishas. Recently, the scope of women's occupations has expanded considerably, and there is a possibility of reaching the same level as men in terms of income. Particularly among primary school teachers, women have already begun to replace men. However, in general occupations, they are still working under the guidance of men. In terms of occupational status, they may even be inferior to women in our country.</p>
<p>Women in rural areas can also work in the fields in the same way as men, and in addition to cooking and preparing meals, they also have to collect firewood and raise children. In reality, they are more hardworking than men. Women in coastal areas can spend all day naked underwater, catching fish and shellfish, called "ama" (sea women). Their endurance and diligence are superior even to men. As the wheel of time turns, young women in rural areas desperately go to the cities, leading to the emergence of many new occupations.</p>
<p>Waitresses in cafes and hotels occupy a very important position in Japanese women's occupations. They greet people with smiles all day long and pour wine for customers. Due to the environment, excellent women are often plunged into the abyss. Although this type of occupation is also despised, the development of cafes and pubs is still increasing day by day. Large cafes and pubs in Ginza often employ two or three hundred waitresses. Smaller ones usually have notices posted year-round, recruiting waitresses. Therefore, it is very easy for young and beautiful women to become cafe waitresses when they are unemployed, which is a special phenomenon in Japanese women's occupations.</p>
<p>Public canteens and department stores are now entirely staffed by women. Male staff members stand on the sidelines and are overshadowed. They are very capable of winning the praise of customers and are loyal to their duties. They are more attentive and courteous than men. Customers and male staff members can also respect each other, so there are few instances of lewdness or jesting, which is commendable.</p>
<p>Women have also been employed in all positions on public buses and some positions as ticket sellers on trams. They are familiar with complicated matters, can explain the names of stops, and help the elderly and children. Therefore, grateful people often anonymously give gifts to female ticket sellers, which is a beautiful story. Other ticket sales positions in theaters and movie theaters are almost all filled by women. Therefore, Japanese women have taken over all ticket selling positions, except for the few women employed as ticket sellers at train stations.</p>
<p>Employing maids and the system of keeping servants are still prevalent in Japan. Maids manage cleaning, tidying, cooking, and laundry. Servants are often used to look after children, and the treatment is similar to that in our country. Only middle-class families or above can afford to employ them. Most ordinary shops in Japan are family-run side businesses, so housewives often manage the shop in addition to household chores. Therefore, shops can reduce employee expenses and are easier to maintain. Although their level of education is above secondary school, they are not ashamed of managing small shops or working as clerks, which is completely different from most newly educated women in our country.</p>
<p>Although there are also female staff members in banks and public organizations, their positions are not high, and they only work as receptionists and guides. Therefore, the occupation of Japanese women is either under the control of men or involves serving others.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Women and Children's Music Education <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Shamei</p>
<p>The reason why the academic music movement in China has not achieved widespread development naturally has objective and subjective reasons. However, from the perspective of the music movement itself, the main reason, in addition to being influenced by the entire Chinese culture, is the consistent neglect of children's music movement, that is, the so-called basic policy of music.</p>
<p>If children's music is highly developed, it will produce a large number of musician cells, or at least create seeds for many pure music appreciators. These are all predictable facts.</p>
<p>The path of children's music movement is children's music education. That is to say, if children's music education is developed, then children's musical knowledge will be widespread, and as a result, children's musical activities will be easily expanded.</p>
<p>Women are consistently close to children, so in principle and in fact, women should assume special tasks for the development of children's music education. At the very least, they cannot shirk their responsibility for enlightening music education.</p>
<p>At the same time, women seem to be naturally rich in musical emotions. Although when the world's musicians are tallied up, women account for a very small number, this does not prove that women's musical abilities are particularly lower than men's, but because women are hindered by their children and families, they cannot consistently pursue musical cultivation, and they often simply stop their efforts after marriage. However, it is most appropriate to use the musical knowledge that women have already acquired for children's music education, and children can easily accept it.</p>
<p>Women naturally have a kind of soft attitude towards children, and this attitude is exactly what is needed for children's music education. In Europe, especially in the United States, most of the elementary school music teachers are women, which shows that women are very suitable for this career. For example, after a child is born, the first thing they hear is their mother's lullaby.</p>
<p>Examining the great musicians, their preliminary musical cultivation almost always comes from their mothers.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Children's Diseases Due to Malnutrition <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Yuxiu</p>
<p>Children's nutritional problems are the most difficult to deal with. For mothers, arranging their children's food is a very difficult task. It is common to see children with yellowish complexions and thin bodies, crying incessantly, making mothers unable to rest day or night. This is a common phenomenon of children getting sick due to malnutrition. Specifically, diseases such as emaciation, rickets, beriberi, and scurvy are all caused by malnutrition. Now, I will briefly explain the symptoms of these diseases and the dietary precautions to be taken in ordinary times for the reference of mothers. If the disease is more serious, it is still necessary to seek medical treatment.</p>
<p>Rickets</p>
<p>There are many causes, the most important of which are: 1. Pregnant women who are still breastfeeding do not have enough calcium in their bodies; 2. Lack of vitamin D in food; 3. Lack of fat and unhealthy living habits.</p>
<p>The symptoms of this disease mostly occur during the teething period of children (minor cases are not easily noticed). Such as slight fever, irritability, restless sleep, those who can walk have a weak gait and do not like to walk, severe cases have very obvious muscle symptoms, or even paralysis, the anterior and posterior fontanelles do not close, the teeth are small and strange, the bone ends become large, the skin is pale, etc.</p>
<p>Scurvy</p>
<p>The cause is lack of vitamin C in food. People who live on ships and cannot get fresh food often have this disease.</p>
<p>Symptoms include weight loss, weakness, pale complexion, spongy gums that bleed easily, bad breath, heart palpitations, headaches, etc. In severe cases in children, the bones separate from the bone shafts.</p>
<p>Beriberi</p>
<p>The cause is lack of vitamin B in food. It is easy to get this disease from eating machine-made white rice.</p>
<p>Infants with this disease can die in a few hours (symptoms similar to the latter). Older children may experience heart palpitations, edema (sometimes none), paralysis, weak limbs, abdominal discomfort, pale complexion, paralyzed limbs, sometimes loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, etc. Symptoms.</p>
<p>Nutritional Attention</p>
<p>Speaking of nutritional problems, fresh milk is naturally the best food because it contains the most vitamins, but it is too expensive, which poses an economic problem, and it is not easy to buy in many places. Soy milk can usually be used as a substitute, and two to three pounds should be consumed daily. Eggs and liver (pork liver, beef liver) should be eaten often because they also contain many vitamins. Vegetables, various vegetables such as green vegetables, cabbage, mustard greens, spinach, all contain vitamins A, B, C, and D. Children who can eat them should eat more, and breastfeeding mothers can cook them in soups or make them into vegetable purees. Fruits such as oranges, grapes, lemons, tangerines, tomatoes (tomatoes contain the same substances as tangerines, but are cheaper), grapes, etc. contain vitamins B and C. Fruits taste good and are appetite stimulants. It is not advisable to use completely white rice. It is advisable to use brown rice and eat pasta foods often to prevent beriberi. Beans should also be eaten often, which can not only prevent beriberi but also contain many carbohydrates, which can lead to obesity. Give fresh beef juice or broth, potato soup, and orange juice as an important food to prevent blood diseases. Infants five or six months old should add orange juice to their milk. The best diet for rickets is breast milk. When infants are breastfed, barley soup, rice water, etc. can be added.</p>
<p>All kinds of food should be cooked soft, easy to digest, and not fried.</p>

<h3 id="e158">The White House Hostess as a Political Activist <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>-- Shrewdness and decisiveness that men cannot match --</p>
<p>Since Mrs. Roosevelt moved into the White House, she has traveled 40,000 miles, given 92 speeches, received 100,050 letters, and given radio speeches for the American Mutual Aid Association, earning $36,000 in American dollars. These records are enough to show how active she is. Moreover, since becoming the hostess of the White House, she has guided all the housework in a large family. Every First Lady is like this. After entering the White House, all charitable organizations will come to donate money, and she will naturally donate some according to the Roosevelt family's charitable nature.</p>
<p>Anyone who is close to her knows that she will not lose any energy and optimism, even though she is so busy with various activities and speeches in two years. In the coming year, she has already planned what work should be done each week in the previous year, but long-distance travel cannot be planned beforehand.</p>
<p>Was it the year before last? She had been to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to investigate charitable causes. Last year, she was already preparing to go to Honolulu and spend the summer in the forest, but in the end, she was too busy to go.</p>
<p>Mrs. Roosevelt's flight to Puerto Rico was not the furthest trip on the 1934 travel chart, because she also went to the Virgin Islands, which are 6,632.8 miles away. The journey by small boat to the islands after getting off the plane was not included.</p>
<p>When she went to the Pacific coast to greet President Roosevelt when he returned from Honolulu in the summer of the year before last, her journey was 10,978 miles. At the end of June, she left Washington in a new sports car, the first new car she bought after moving into the White House.</p>
<p>On the journey, she traveled 2,000 miles, passing through West Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky. On July 8, she arrived in Chicago. On the way, she went to the countryside in West Virginia and Tennessee to conduct field investigations into social problems.</p>
<p>From Chicago to Sagamore, she traveled by plane, a total of 1,919 miles. By this time, her traveling life had been going on for a month. California newspapers said that she was at Lake Tahoe because her beloved daughter, Mrs. Dahl, was going through a divorce at that time.</p>
<p>Later, she spent a week at Lake Tahoe and Yosemite Valley. Finally, she rushed to the Pacific to meet Roosevelt. Then, she and the President and his entourage went to various places to conduct investigations. In short, her 40,000-mile journey was counted very accurately by those close to her.</p>
<p>The letters received by Mrs. Roosevelt were constantly sent to the White House every day, and there was indeed no interruption in the two years. However, she did not read most of these letters. Questions about political issues were handed over to the government for reply, and other letters were replied to by her secretary.</p>
<p>However, there were many letters that she opened herself. These letters were probably to provide help in economic and emotional matters. If possible, these letters were answered satisfactorily. However, letters asking for private donations were also handled by the secretary, because there were sometimes about 300 of these letters a week.</p>
<p>The 92 speeches mentioned above by Mrs. Roosevelt, like her travels, are recorded very reliably. She only says less, not more, because she will give a speech whenever a problem arises. The short and unnoticed ones are not included. The ninety times mentioned here are only formal speeches and radio broadcasts.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1934, she gave a radio speech for the Mutual Aid Association and earned $3,000 per speech. However, she later donated this huge amount of money entirely to charitable organizations.</p>
<p>Special Report</p>
<h3 id="e159">A Visit to Ms. Zhang Lizhen, President of the Shanghai YWCA <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Jiping</p>
<p>After Mrs. Jin Longzhang, president of the Shanghai YWCA, went to Yunnan, the association's affairs were presided over by Ms. Zhang Lizhen. Everyone finds this Ms. Zhang's name very unfamiliar, so they only know her as Mrs. He Linyi. When we mention Zhang Lizhen, we must first talk about her father - Zhang Chanfen. Mr. Zhang has served the Commercial Press for many years. He is a truly remarkable person, who is always eager to help others and enthusiastic about education. He not only cultivated his own children to be successful, but also founded many schools to educate other people's children. Readers all know that there are two schools with a long history in Shanghai, one is Qingxin Middle School and the other is Qingxin Girls' Middle School. The principals of the two schools, Zhang Shilin and Zhang Rongzhen, are Mr. Zhang's sons and daughters. They are a family of educators, and they are indeed worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>A Life of Music</p>
<p>Although this Ms. Lizhen is not a principal, she has been consistently diligent in serving the cause of social education. People say that she is a leader in the women's movement and a new good wife and wise mother. She herself once said: "Some of my father's work ethic has been passed on to me!" This shows the greatness of the influence of family education. She especially loves music and has had a bit of talent since she was a child. After graduating from McTyeire School, she stayed at her alma mater as a music teacher. In 1916, she studied at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music in the United States, worked hard, and achieved great success. She recalled her time in the United States, saying: "Some of our classmates had already turned gray, but they were still very interested and had a more vigorous spirit than women in our country. I felt that I used my parents' hard-earned money, so I didn't dare to slack off. I also thought that the opportunity to study in the United States in my lifetime might only be these two years, so I stepped up my efforts and lived much more difficult lives than government-funded students. … For the past twenty years, I have still lived a life of music. First, I served as a music instructor at Tsinghua University in Beiping. In recent years, I have been a music instructor at Moore Memorial Girls' School for four and a half days a week in Shanghai. Music is my only hobby. There is always a concert at sea. I am either performing" or appreciating it. Some people have advised me to retire and stop working, but I think that I can't bear to give up more than twenty years of hard work once. I hope this ambition will not wane as I get old!"</p>
<p>Street Children Have a Way to Live</p>
<p>I asked her which social cause she is currently involved in that she finds the most interesting. She said: "Although I am a director of Qingxin Girls' Middle School, Pu Yi Xiang, and the YWCA, I have made no contribution. Only the Fu Tong Suo (Orphanage) has been more meaningful. I didn't feel that there were too many refugees when I was in Beiping. When I arrived in Shanghai, I found many miserable street children everywhere. I thought about ways to help them. Three years ago, I co-founded the 'Fu Tong Suo' with Mr. Li Zhengahui and others. Last year, we moved to a new site in Jiangwan, providing education and handicrafts to orphaned street children so that they can have a skill to support themselves. It is also a solution to social problems. One end. However, at the beginning of the establishment, the economy was not very prosperous. I hope that enthusiastic people will do their best to help. I think that although street children are in a difficult situation, those who are talented and self-motivated may have more hope than the children of wealthy families.</p>
<p>Women Must Be Self-Aware</p>
<p>I also asked her what she thinks of working women today. She said, "There are currently four phenomena in the job market: Everyone is looking for a job but can't find the right one; everything is asking for people but can't find the right person; once they have a job, they are unwilling to be truly responsible; they protect their own position and don't care about other people's suffering. These four situations are the same for men and women in today's society. So, women's careers can't be developed for the time being." I said, then what does Mrs. He hope for women? "This is hard to say. I mean, women who only eat and don't care about things should use their brains to do some good deeds: working women should have perseverance, be responsible, and not be extravagant; those who have been cultivated by the public should try their best to seek public welfare; ladies with good family conditions should generously donate to public welfare, and embody the virtue of heaven's love for life, and not be just grandchildren and cattle and horses, this is the supreme virtue of helping others and helping yourself! ..."</p>
<h3 id="e160">Women Under Fascism <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Su</p>
<p>-- Depriving women of their rights and promoting national power --</p>
<p>In the modern women's liberation movement, being devastated by fascism is enough to make the spring peaches and plums lose their color.</p>
<p>Fascism is an overbearing military rule, which fundamentally opposes so-called civil rights and women's liberation. It advocates that everything be manipulated by a dictator supported by a group of warriors. Women are just appendages under male warriors; they are only fit to nurture future warriors and to serve veterans.</p>
<p>Mussolini once said bluntly: The vocation of women is to obey. Women's participation in politics will weaken the power of the country. Do you know why Anglo-Saxons are gradually coming to an end? It is because women's rights have expanded! In our country, there is absolutely no talk of women's participation in politics.</p>
<p>In fascist countries, all elections are manipulated by the leaders. Women's fascist groups must be subordinate to men's organizations. Female party members must be at least twenty-two years old to be eligible. In politics, they cannot stand on their own and can only follow behind male party members and listen to their instructions.</p>
<p>University education in Italy was originally non-gender-specific. Some middle-aged and older female professors were also quite well-known. However, after the fascists came to power, they formulated new regulations: male students over the age of eleven must not be taught by female teachers in subjects related to character development.</p>
<p>Women cannot be warriors, so women are just reproductive tools for warriors. Encouraging childbirth and increasing the population is one of Italy's domestic policies. The minimum marriage age in Italy was originally set at fifteen for women and eighteen for men. Now it has been reduced to fourteen for women and sixteen for men. This is tantamount to using the law to destroy women and put them on the road to premature aging.</p>
<p>In the past, the laws of some countries allowed men to whip their wives, as long as the whip was no thicker than the thumb, it was considered innocent. Now, no country has such an unequal law. The new Italian criminal law is particularly lenient in punishing men who abuse their wives or children. If a man inflicts injury or illness on his wife due to his own negligence, he used to be sentenced to imprisonment for up to five years; now he is only sentenced to detention for up to six months. Those who abuse their wives to death were formerly charged with violent homicide; now they have been reduced to imprisonment for up to eight years. In this way, husbands have the freedom to whip their wives, and as long as they are not beaten to the point of breaking bones, the victims have no recourse.</p>
<p>Also, if a wife runs away from her husband's home because she cannot stand her husband's abuse, she can be reported to the police and punished with imprisonment for up to one year or a fine of more than 1,000 to 10,000 lira. As for husbands who leave home because they are not satisfied with their wives, they are not subject to legal sanctions.</p>
<p>Italy's current criminal law ... wives who commit adultery are sentenced to imprisonment for up to two years. This is unique in European countries today. However, married men who commit adultery are not prohibited by law. Old law: Men who discover their wives, daughters, or biological sisters committing adultery and kill them are sentenced to imprisonment for three to seven years. Now, the fascist new law gives special leniency to men who kill their wives, daughters, or biological sisters for reasons of honor.</p>
<p>The punishment for women who lose their chastity is so severe, while the punishment for men who commit adultery is so light. To what extent does this deformed law degrade the status of women!</p>
<p>China has a man-eating code of ethics, and foreign countries have man-eating laws. When will women's layers of shackles be liberated?</p>

<p>It's a bitterly cold winter morning.</p>
<p>The morning bell has rung, but the students in the dormitory haven't gotten up yet. They're still dreaming rosy dreams in their warm, cozy blankets!</p>
<p>Winter is indeed cold, with northwest winds sharp as knives blowing against people; it's so unbearably cold! No wonder the students want to stay in bed!</p>
<p>"Huh? Where did my socks go?" The big, snow-like figure in the mosquito net asks herself.</p>
<p>"What time is it?" Hui asks, yawning in her blanket.</p>
<p>"Oh! The morning bell has already rung; it's almost time for breakfast!" Fen peeks her head out and says, looking at her watch.</p>
<p>"Get up, get up!" Old lady Qian calls from her bed.</p>
<p>A flurry of activity, as a group of young ladies emerges from their beds, still yawning and stretching.</p>
<p>As they exclaim sweetly, "Ah! Ah!"</p>
<p>"Dong! Dong! Dong!" The second bell rings, signaling breakfast time.</p>
<p>And so, a group of young ladies lines up and heads to the dining hall.</p>
<p>Heads form a chain, winding and curving into the dining hall door; instantly, the dining hall is lively with people!</p>
<p>After a period of chaos, the dining hall is silent, with only the sounds of chopsticks and bowls touching.</p>
<p>After a while, there's another flurry of activity as the young ladies head back to the dormitory to wash up!</p>

<h3 id="e162">A Brief History of Women's Affairs in Shanghai, China () <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Chen Beiru</p>
<p>Everyone knows that promoting education for both the emperor and the common people is an urgent task for revitalizing China. It is hoped that in the future, with the help of all sectors, these schools will flourish and thrive, and that their students will be nurtured by the gentle breeze and timely rain, which will benefit not only this association. Recalling the January 28th Incident, we exerted our utmost efforts to care for wounded soldiers, donate supplies, and protect civilians. We also contributed to aviation donations, doing our best to fulfill our national duty. Furthermore, we enthusiastically supported various charitable organizations such as schools for the blind, orphanages, women and children's hospitals, Jiangwan children's teaching centers, and women's temperance societies, and were happy to see their success. My colleagues consider Shanghai to be the largest market in the Far East, with officials and dignitaries from all over the world coming and going. Whenever important foreign groups or dignitaries come to China for visits, the association sincerely guides them to visit scenic spots and present the spirit of our country, so that they can develop a good impression of our country. The reception of the American Economic Survey Mission, the Austrian Women's Righteousness Group, and the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Women's Group are particularly noteworthy examples. The Pacific Women's Conference held in Honolulu developed its spirit, and sent Mrs. Jin Longzhang and others to participate, achieving remarkable results. The current president of this association, Mrs. Mei Huaquan, is also the vice president of the Pacific Women's Association. She is about to plan for the attendance of the Chinese delegation at the conference in 1937, and deeply hopes that the future representatives will be able to negotiate appropriately, bring glory to the country, and further enhance our country's culture and the status of women internationally. We cannot help but anticipate this! What we are proud of is our cooperation with the Shanghai International Women's Association to seek the rights that our women should have. The association has three representatives who meet monthly. They discuss ways to promote the progress of Shanghai's municipal administration, such as requesting the Concession Bureau to set up more parks, improve the treatment of child labor, and establish more girls' schools to make it easier for women residing in the Concession to receive education. The large girls' school on Singapore Road is the result of our efforts. If our plan to request attendance at the Municipal Council Committee succeeds, the future of our women will be even brighter. Moreover, the women of the association have the opportunity to help each other, exchange knowledge, and thus create solid friendships and good impressions, so that Chinese and foreign women can unite in spirit to improve municipal and social undertakings, benefiting women from all countries in Shanghai, thanks to the support of the association. The above is a description of the association's past achievements. Although not perfect, we are quite fortunate to have served society and fulfilled our national duty to some extent. We especially hope that all sectors will give us timely guidance to make up for our shortcomings. We have great expectations for all gentlemen to teach and enlighten us.</p>

<p>(Letter from Mr. Jiao Yuantai of Pudong) (Excerpt above) A person's appearance and looks are the most important thing. Clothing is also essential. Therefore, everyone loves to groom themselves. The Book of Rites says: "The beginning of etiquette lies in correcting one's appearance." It also says: "Zeng Zi and Zi Gong entered their stables and groomed themselves." As for worldly women, they regard grooming as their second life. However, the face is always exposed, and skin diseases are easier to attack than other parts, and there are more opportunities for them to occur. Acne, freckles, and pimples are prominent and more common. Moreover, these symptoms often occur during youth. If one suffers from these, there is rarely anyone who does not regret it. If one's appearance is not neat, what is the point of ritual? In the past, there were no special remedies for treating acne, freckles, and pimples, let alone good ones. Since the appearance of "Mian Li" fragrant cream, it is a refreshing sight. This product has special effects in treating the above symptoms, and it has created a new era of beauty products. My cousin Ling Shouqing and my classmate Wang Zhiduan both used "Mian Li" to cure their acne. My sister also used "Mian Li" to cure her freckles, which she had suffered from for more than ten years. Such a good medicine is truly unique. Therefore, I do not hesitate to write this and post it in your esteemed publication so that patients can make a choice and those seeking beauty can know where to inquire. (Excerpt below)</p>
<h3 id="e164">Trivial Talk on Treating Ringworm <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— (Xingqiao)</p>
<p>In the past, ringworm was regarded as a stubborn disease that could not be cured because it was difficult to find a suitable and effective treatment. This is a great pity. Even if there were treatments, they often contained highly potent medicinal ingredients. If used improperly, they could be dangerous. The ringworm was not cured, and internal diseases broke out. Doctors and patients all sighed. Since the invention of "Ganlu (Sweet Dew)," after being used on ringworm patients by dermatologists in major hospitals, it has achieved amazing results without any side effects. It is not absorbed by the skin and does not cause internal diseases. It is truly an effective medicine for skin diseases. This medicine is rich in permeability, has a particularly strong bactericidal power, and can indeed cure all stubborn skin ringworm diseases. Moreover, the combination of ingredients is reasonable, and it does not stain clothes. The fragrant smell is just a bonus. I like to use this to treat people for ringworm and have repeatedly achieved miraculous results. I dare to guarantee that there will be no drawbacks. It is named "Ganlu (Sweet Dew)," which is appropriate.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note: "Ganlu (Sweet Dew)" is a miraculous medicine known at home and abroad. Its sales location is at No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, Fada Road, Shanghai. Tongren Western Medicine Company. Each bottle is sold for only one yuan. Mild cases only need one bottle. Severe cases need at most two bottles. All can be completely restored to their original healthy state.)</p>

<p>(Letter from Mr. Yang Enzhan of this city) I have suffered from acne for many years. The pimples almost covered my entire face. My appearance was damaged, and I felt a slight pain. I have repeatedly tried to find a way to treat it without success. Last year, I wrote to your publication for advice. You suggested using "Mian Li" cream, which would have quick effects. Therefore, I bought two bottles one after another and used them as directed. Sure enough, within a few days, it had been reduced by half. After a few more days, it was completely cured. The countless pimples that could not be removed or cured have been swept away. These two bottles of "Mian Li" are still unused. Three months have passed since then, and it has not recurred. This is truly a good beauty medicine and an essential boon for young men and women. I use these few lines to express my gratitude.</p>
<h3 id="e166">The Causes and Treatments of Neurasthenia <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— (Liren)</p>
<p>Neurasthenia is a type of chronic neurological disorder. On the surface, it does not appear to be a serious illness, but it secretly deals a severe blow to the patient. If not treated early, the consequences will be dire. The most important aspects are: (1) mental depression and weak will, resulting in a decline in judgment; (2) mental confusion, aversion to work, lack of strength and fatigue; (3) easy progression to severe mental illness; (4) ability to transmit the predisposition of the disease to descendants; and (5) a shorter lifespan than normal people. This disease is more common in men between the ages of 20 and 50 because they have more opportunities for overworking their mind and body, indulging in debauchery and alcohol, and other things that harm their mind and body than women. There are many causes of this disease: (1) mental overwork; (2) excessive masturbation and sexual activity, especially masturbation; (3) mental stimulation; (4) suffering from typhoid fever, lung disease, syphilis, leukorrhea, and other diseases; and (5) addiction to stimulants, such as smoking and drinking. In terms of medication for treating this disease, "Hailbang" pills sold by Tongren Western Medicine Company at No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, Fada Road, Shanghai, are the most effective. The price is two yuan per bottle. In addition, it is advisable to quit masturbation, moderate sexual activity, do not smoke, do not drink, temporarily stop mental work, and avoid pessimism so that the nerves are not subjected to any slight stimulation. Singing, reading poetry, walking, playing chess, chatting, and listening to the radio or phonograph can all be done at will, but not for too long, otherwise it will cause fatigue. Every morning after getting up, use a towel soaked in cold water to wipe the whole body for ten minutes, then wipe with a dry towel to make the blood circulation and digestive power vigorous and enhance skin resistance. The portion of food should be small, and the number of meals should be many to prevent the digestive function from getting tired. Fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C should be consumed more. Tonic products such as cod liver oil, eggs, chicken soup, beef, and beef juice can be added to the diet according to one's taste, so that the nutritional aspect is greatly benefited.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Good News for Those Suffering from Gonorrhea <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— (Di Min)</p>
<p>In general, 100% of women engaged in prostitution are infected with gonorrhea. Therefore, men who patronize prostitutes are also almost 100% likely to be infected with gonorrhea. Once gonorrhea occurs, the best policy is to visit a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. Or perhaps some, due to feelings of shame, avoid medical treatment and are misled by various exaggerated promotions, rashly purchasing gonorrhea medicines of poor quality for self-treatment. Little do they know that such medicines are mostly astringent or antiseptic materials. Taking them not only does no good but rather allows the gonorrhea germs to lie dormant and tend towards becoming chronic. It is difficult to achieve the expected effect. In modern times, science is becoming increasingly prosperous, and the internal medicine product "Gonadoden" for treating gonorrhea has been invented, with the most significant effect. It is suitable for both acute and chronic cases. "Gonadoden" is manufactured based on the latest scientific principles. Its ability to kill gonorrhea germs is a hundred times greater than that of all internal medicines for treating gonorrhea. It also has the effects of promoting urination, reducing inflammation, eliminating swelling, relieving pain, clearing the blood, and detoxifying. It is truly the outstanding internal medicine for treating gonorrhea. Is this not good news for gonorrhea patients? The selling price of "Gonadoden" is two yuan per box. Tongren Western Medicine Company, No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, Fada Road, is the manager.</p>
<h3 id="e168">On Leukorrhea <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— (Yang Wen)</p>
<p>The structure of the female reproductive organs is very different from that of men, and because they have special physiological functions, they naturally have a certain defensive function. A slight amount of liquid is secreted to kill invading pathogens. If the reproductive organs are subjected to excessive stimulation or uncleanliness, this natural function will be hindered and inflammation will occur. Therefore, pathogens are not afraid and can exert their ability to do evil, even invading the interior and causing various diseases such as dual inflammation, cervicitis, endometritis, and parenchymal inflammation. The most prominent symptom is the abnormal increase in secretion as a result of inflammation. This is what is called red and white leukorrhea. If pathogens invade deeper into the body, it will cause uterine parametritis, salpingitis, oophoritis, and even pelvic peritonitis and peritonitis. Severe cases pose a life-threatening risk. Knowing the subtle signs, a good doctor treats the disease before it occurs. Therefore, those who feel that they have excessive leukorrhea should seek treatment as soon as possible and prevent it from spreading, lest it become difficult to treat. The "Internal Leukorrhea Pills" and "External Leukorrhea Medicine" sold by Tongren Western Medicine Company at No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, Fada Road, Shanghai, can be called effective medicines for treating women's leukorrhea. It is said that each box sells for two yuan. Those who suffer from this disease can take it as directed to achieve a safe treatment effect and prevent the progression of the disease.</p>

<p>(Letter from Mr. Xue Rang of Wujin) Editor, speaking of "Mian Li," isn't that a very famous modern beauty treatment? It is said to be very effective in treating freckles, acne, and dark skin. At first, I didn't really believe it. Later, after several trials, I actually got very satisfactory results. It seems worth reporting. In fact, I also suffered from freckles. Because I was shocked by the fame of "Mian Li," I bought a bottle from Tongren Western Medicine Company in Shanghai this spring to try. For the first three or five days, I didn't see any effect. After a week, the spots gradually became lighter. I applied it for about a month, day and night. Not only was my face whiter than before, but the freckles had also disappeared. This can be called amazing and far from being comparable to ordinary products that are only famous in name. I hereby record it as above.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Acute Gastritis <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— (Zui Hong)</p>
<p>Acute gastritis arises from excessive drinking and eating, or eating foods containing stimulants, or accidentally eating chemical poisons or rotten food mixed with microbes. When the symptoms of this disease occur, the stomach feels heavy, full, and painful, and dizziness, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and other phenomena also occur at the same time. The tongue has a white, thick coating. The stool is either thin or constipated. The urine is small and dark red. Those with a weak constitution may also develop a slight fever. The treatment for this disease is to first use an emetic to expel harmful substances from the stomach. If the food has reached the intestines, castor oil can be taken to clear it. If the stomach pain is severe, a warm water bag can be used to warm the stomach and relieve it. Absolutely avoid solid food. Only water or liquid food such as milk rice soup can be sipped. When the disease improves slightly, thin porridge can be taken. This disease often causes a type of acidic fermentation chemical reaction. Therefore, in terms of medication, alkaline medicines can be taken. "Wei Biling (Stomach Must Be Effective)" sold by Tongren Western Medicine Company at No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, Fada Road, Shanghai, is most suitable for treating acute and chronic gastritis, as well as stomach pain and stomach weakness, and has always been known for its effectiveness. It is said that each box sells for one yuan.</p>

<p>Heart and Stomach Qi Pain</p>
<p>My female relative has always been healthy. In recent years, she suddenly developed a symptom of heart and stomach qi pain, which led to a sharp decline in her diet and a gradual weakening of her body. I have always known that your publication provides accurate guidance. Please provide a good prescription. (Asked by Wu Longxiang)</p>

<p>Husband and Wife with Gonorrhea</p>
<p>I am 24 years old and have a weak will. Driven by sexual desire, I stepped into the brothel and contracted leukorrhea two years ago. It has not been eradicated. My innocent wife has also been implicated. She gave birth to a child last year who died within a month. The loss of money is countless. I am asking for advice. Please provide a good prescription. (Asked by He Shengtao)</p>
<p>(Answer) This is chronic leukorrhea. Since your wife has been infected, you should both receive medical treatment. "Gonadoden" sold by Tongren Western Medicine Company in this city is effective in treating acute and chronic leukorrhea. There are also internal and external leukorrhea medicines for treating women's gonorrhea, which are also very reliable. All these good medicines should be purchased and taken.</p>
<p>Emission Upon Seeing Women</p>
<p>My son is 20 years old and unmarried. He is learning a trade at a silk shop in Jia County. He recently returned home and looks haggard and in poor spirits. When I asked him what was wrong, I learned that he had committed the bad habit of masturbation, which led to frequent spermatorrhea, emission upon seeing women, and neurasthenia. I don't know if there is an effective treatment for this. (Asked by Shu Mingfu)</p>
<p>(Answer) For your son's condition, the first thing he needs to do is to quit the bad habit. At the same time, he should take "Hailbang" pills, which will have a great effect. This medicine is sold by Shanghai Tongren Western Medicine Company. The price is two yuan per bottle.</p>

<p>Ganlu Medicine Water</p>
<p>I am naturally obese and suffer from stubborn and difficult-to-treat ringworm. Every time it occurs, I feel pain and itching, and my whole body is uncomfortable. It is especially worse in spring and summer. I suffer endlessly. Recently, I sought treatment at a local hospital and bought "Ganlu" medicine water to apply, saying it would have miraculous effects. But I don't know if this medicine is effective. Do pharmacies in Wuhan sell it? (Asked by Li Wende)</p>
<p>(Answer) Ganlu treats ringworm and its effects are well-known. This medicine is issued by Tongren Western Medicine Company at No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, Fada Road, Shanghai.

<h3 id="e172">Educating Criminals <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>According to Company A: The warden of the Second Jiangsu Prison in this city believes that educating criminals is highly valued in civilized countries. Therefore, he has specifically written to the Chinese Buddhist Association, requesting that it appoint a Dharma master to come to the prison to give Buddhist lectures, so that they can reach the other shore together. It is heard that the Chinese Buddhist Association believes that the number of prisoners in the prison is the highest in the country, and that it is important to promote Buddhism and influence their psychology. It has been decided to appoint Zhong Kanghou to take charge of this matter and to gather Dharma masters and lay practitioners to give lectures at any time.</p>
<p>Regarding life in prison, with such a long period of time without freedom, how do the prisoners get by? This is something that we "free people" on the outside cannot know. However, by reading the newspaper, we can occasionally learn some snippets of their lives. For example, in a certain prison in a certain place, prisoners rebelled by going on a "hunger strike" because they couldn't stand the kind of life they were living inside. In a certain prison at a certain time, "disturbances" were caused by the prisoners due to insufficient food. In addition, there is also the case of old prisoners taking advantage of new prisoners and causing a violent fight, and even death row inmates being prayed for and confessing by religious priests at the execution ground in preparation for entering "heaven"... All of these are condensed forms of the lives that prisoners live, right?</p>
<p>As for what kind of educational work is carried out in prisons, apart from the so-called "model prisons" and the unique "reformatories," I have not heard of any. Now, the Second Prison in this city is indeed "valuing" the "educational work" of prisoners, which cannot but be a welcome thing!</p>
<p>Originally, crime has become one of the serious social maladies of today. Along with social poverty and class disparity, the number of crimes is bound to increase day by day. As far as criminology is concerned, crimes are divided into two types: "objective" and "subjective." Criminals are also divided into three types: "instinctive" (innate) criminals, "habitual" criminals (which are further divided into "professional" and "accidental habitual criminals"), and "occasional" criminals.</p>
<p>Speaking of civilized countries valuing the education of criminals, as far as we know, most of the treatment methods are divided into two types: "separate confinement system" and "graded system." The former aims to cut off the opportunity for prisoners to learn evil from each other; the latter treats first-time offenders with a relatively harsh life as the first level, followed by joint work, and finally a free level...</p>
<p>However, in today's Second Prison in this city, the authorities are "valuing" the education of criminals by starting with "propagating Buddhism," which cannot but be disappointing. Religion—Buddhism, in today's world, is indeed being "valued" and utilized in this way. The famous "Kalachakra Initiation Ceremony" and "Disaster Relief Conference" are all their masterpieces. Therefore, due to their "purpose" and their "great aspirations," the result of the so-called "Dharma masters and lay practitioners" "propagating Buddhism" and "influencing the psychology" of prisoners is predictable!</p>
<p>Originally, no one would deny that the main causes of general crime and the increase in the number of crimes are inextricably linked to the objective environment of society. A certain sociologist said based on his research: "The number of thefts and the rise in the price of bread maintain a constant positive correlation"! Isn't that so? A pickpocket who came out of prison after only a week finally resumed his old "three hands" business and was locked up again because he couldn't find a job and couldn't get food. This was only a few days ago.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to "educate criminals" and "influence their psychology," we should first "face" the fundamental problems of reality! All the nice-sounding empty words and methods will not last!</p>

<p>"Hu Tong flowers!" As soon as she saw the Hu Tong flowers, she thought of what had happened the day before yesterday and yesterday. The affectionate Taiji (note), was so earnestly in love with her, he ran out with her behind the back of the prince to have a secret date with her. "He knows what girls' hearts are like, he knows what girls need? Heji! My very life!" Since yesterday she has been thinking like this!</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>"Why isn't he here yet? He said he wouldn't forget me!"</p>
<p>The Suttonkho River whispered to the sunlight, and Baidanorlejing faced the river and sang happily again:</p>
<p>The flowing water is clear and clear,</p>
<p>Little slave listens to what brother says,</p>
<p>From now on, I will be with you until old age,</p>
<p>If you change your heart, you will go blind,</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Taiji came on horseback with two other people. Baidanorlejing waved to Taiji from afar. When he got closer, Taiji got off his horse. The two people were short, and she didn't bother to look at them. She went to hug Taiji, but Taiji ignored her. Only then did she look at the two people in disappointment: one was a man in his forties, with a fierce look in his eyes. Without thinking, she remembered seeing him five days ago. He was not one of our countrymen. He took photos under Mount Ruserui and asked many people for directions. How to get to Kabito? How to get to Dukan? He wrote them all down in his book. The other was a woman, a beautiful young woman. Needless to say, she was also a ×× person, closely following Taiji. The way she twisted and turned almost made Baidanorlejing angry!</p>
<p>"What place is across the river to the east?" The man asked Taiji</p>
<p>"Tebukenci Plain, there are also salt lakes there." Taiji said as he pointed into the distance.</p>
<p>Baidanorlejing was extremely angry, and the flames of jealousy burned all over her body. Taiji still happily mounted his horse and walked north with the two people.</p>
<p>(Note) Taiji is the son of the prince.</p>

<p>— Shi Feng</p>
<p>This spring is a "false spring." It's almost the sixth day of March, but we still can't take off our cotton clothes. The wind sneaks sharply into our sleeves like a slick rat, making us feel like it's crawling all over us. As dusk approaches, the sky becomes even more desolate, and the streets become somewhat deserted. The entire small town is trapped in a terrifying situation. Rows of houses and trees are all sobbing silently.</p>
<p>Jin Jizhi, as if without any strength, breathed a sigh, put down his carrying pole, looked around, and sighed again.</p>
<p>What to do? It's getting dark soon, where should he go?</p>
<p>He walked out of a dilapidated temple in the morning and wandered through the streets and alleys, hoping that something would lead him forward. A group of children followed him like a monkey on a leash. Finally, he found a place, set up his frame, and tapped the small copper gong. A group of students dressed as children crowded around. He used the drumstick to draw a circle in front of the crowd, then pointed to the pictures and said in a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>—Look inside: there's Zhang Zuolin fighting Wu Peifu, the 19th Route Army fighting the Japanese, ... and Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek leading the Northern Expedition...</p>
<p>As he spoke, he looked around to see if there was anyone who might object. He dropped the first few pictures, revealing half of a picture of several naked women:</p>
<p>—Ah, this one is called "Picking Grapes," it's a bit racy. Look at this child... there's also a young woman, and an old mother...</p>
<p>He dropped this picture and another new one appeared: it was carved out of wood, two people who looked like an old couple hugging each other. When he pulled and released the string, the two people kissed each other intimately. The children laughed loudly. So he happily tapped the picture with the drumstick and said with excitement:</p>
<p>—This is nothing special, the special part is inside. When you pull this string, there are fun things to see inside!... Who wants to watch? Who wants to watch?...</p>
<p>He tapped the drumstick on each glass window, staring straight ahead, hoping that all five viewing spots would be filled immediately, and then he could start the second round. However, after waiting for two or three minutes, only two children sat down to watch, with three spots still empty. He couldn't start it like this. So he had to take matters into his own hands and pull the potential customers, because according to his past experience, many people wanted to watch but were too embarrassed. Especially here on the street, so close to their homes, if their fathers or older brothers saw them watching, it would be awkward. But as long as he pulled them with his hand, they would sit down. He pulled two young men nearby and said: —Hey brother, do me a favor... help me out. The good stuff is inside. It's cold standing here, sit down and watch, sit down and watch...</p>
<p>The two men looked at each other, smiled, and sat down. He couldn't wait any longer, so he sang a little tune and pulled down the pictures one by one. The children exclaimed loudly at the scenes of war inside, and the young men hoped that he would quickly pull down the second picture, the third picture,... and get to the last two pictures soon. They were no longer paying attention to the war scenes. He thought to himself: faster, faster. At this moment, two young girls of fifteen or sixteen years old came and sat down, sharing one viewing spot. ... This is terrible, really, there's no way to continue the show: how can he show those pictures with girls watching?... But the two young men were even more interested and urged him to continue. Past "Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek leading the Northern Expedition" was "The Vineyard," what to do? He had no choice but to beg the girls to leave, but they were so stubborn and insisted on watching!</p>
<p>Go on, let them watch! Just don't blush!</p>
<p>The young men snickered. The girls watched intently without saying a word. So he continued the show.... When it was about to change to the next picture, he was very worried, but he was urged on, so he had to clap the board with the bell, and the picture inside changed. With this change, the two young men laughed loudly, the children also made a fuss, but the girls angrily cursed and left! He had to smile bitterly, apologize, and continue to play!</p>
<p>One after another, he earned some money. He ate a slightly more filling meal in the morning. But in the afternoon, no matter where he went, no one watched. Many children shouted and jumped as they went home to ask for money, but they never came back the same way they went: some pouting, some even shedding tears.</p>
<p>It was getting dark. Where to go? He sighed, watched the dusk gradually deepen, and walked towards the temple where he had stayed last night!</p>
<h3 id="e175">Story Beneath Mount Ma'an <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>"Brother Tao San has been arrested!" Little Pockmark, who was working in the fields with Brother Tao San, ran back to tell Sister-in-law Tao San.</p>
<p>The sun was right overhead, and Sister-in-law Tao San was carrying a lunch basket, preparing to go to the fields when she ran into Little Pockmark's report on the bank of the field. This report was like a sharp arrow, piercing through Sister-in-law Tao San's heart, and she fell to the ground on the bank. Immediately, people from the surrounding area gathered around. By the time Sister-in-law Tao San woke up, almost everyone under Mount Ma'an was here. Everyone was arguing and guessing the reason for Brother Tao San's arrest.</p>
<p>"Alright, she's awake." Old Man Tang pushed through the crowd as if mediating a dispute and approached Sister-in-law Tao San. He was the elder under Mount Ma'an. Although they didn't have the titles of village chief or town chief, Old Man Tang's words still carried some weight. He sat on the ground and pushed Little Pockmark, saying, "Tell me exactly what happened? Speak slowly."</p>
<p>Little Pockmark was the public servant of the families under Mount Ma'an. During the busy farming season, he helped with work in turns. His reward was a full stomach and a place to sleep. He had plenty of strength, and he had patted his chest and said: Twenty or thirty people are really nothing to me! But he felt that today's events were too unexpected. He stared at Sister-in-law Tao San's pale face and stammered:</p>
<p>"Today Brother Tao San was happy, and we were dividing the field bank to work. At first, there were only two passersby who greeted Brother Tao San, but they didn't say many words before they started fighting... and they just grabbed him and took him away..."</p>
<p>Little Pockmark's face turned red, as if he were struggling to create a story. Little Pockmark usually liked to exaggerate when telling stories, and some of the men laughed when they saw him. But Old Man Tang hit Little Pockmark's calf with his dry tobacco pipe, saying:</p>
<p>"Where did your legs go? Don't lie, tell me clearly so we can deal with it!"</p>
<p>Seeing Old Man Tang's tense face, Little Pockmark seemed even more flustered. But as he hesitated, Old Man Tang's dry tobacco pipe made a second demonstration on his calf. Although he could clench his teeth and endure a few blows from even the heaviest stick, he was afraid of that tense face, and finally shouted out in a panic like a child:</p>
<p>"I just pulled down my pants to take a shit!"</p>
<p>The people around burst into thunderous laughter, and a look of sorrowful tears appeared on Sister-in-law Tao San's pale face. Old Man Tang hit Little Pockmark's buttocks with his dry tobacco pipe again, asked his wife to help Sister-in-law Tao San into the house, confidently instructed everyone to go back to work, and followed Sister-in-law Tao San into her house.</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Tao San had no appetite to eat, and Old Man Tang helped her clean up. Then he watched Old Man Tang pace back and forth in the house. Not even the time it takes to burn an incense stick had passed when the local constable A Xing sneaked in like a thief. When he saw Old Man Tang, he was stunned, but Old Man Tang shouted at him: "A Xing, you've done a good deed!"</p>
<p>"I'm just here to report the news," A Xing smiled flatteringly, "Landlord Zhang just sent someone to arrest Brother Tao San, saying that Brother Tao San still owes five dou of old rent..."</p>
<p>Old Man Tang repeatedly tapped the ground with his dry tobacco pipe, as if the ground were his enemy, "I, Old Man Tang, also owe him rent, why didn't you arrest me? Hmph, you've done a good deed! My wife is old, not as pretty as Sister-in-law Tao San!"</p>
<p>Old Man Tang spoke with urgency, standing like a door god in front of A Xing, shooting fire-like glances at him, and putting his dry tobacco pipe against his neck, saying:</p>
<p>"A Xing, how much money did you take from Landlord Zhang? You eat the food of Mount Ma'an, you can't marry Sister-in-law Tao San as your wife, so you came up with this vicious plan. I, Old Man Tang, am willing to risk my old age to see if you still have food to eat under Mount Ma'an!" (To be continued)</p>

<p>Hitler recently gave a speech in Jena, saying that the Treaty of Versailles should be a tombstone, only enough for people to hang and mourn in front of. Tan Lao San said that although the old tombstones are lying in the weeds and trampled by shepherds and woodcutters, there are still many new tombstones being erected, one by one, which can still make archaeologists weep and kneel and kowtow. Alas.</p>
<p>The truth about the box corpse case at the Beijing East Railway Station a few days ago has been revealed. The reason was due to a love triangle between master and servant. Tan Lao San said that the ancients said that lust is the root of all evil. From this case, we can see that the words of the ancients are not wrong after all.</p>

<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Cun's best "self-criticism" is these two famous words: "Love makes one want them to live, hating makes one want them to die." "(The likes of Wu Cun.) Brother Wanqiu is not in the co-op—this is because there is old text to copy; so I specifically copied it—Zhi Er) can now be regarded as hating me). "Look": When talking about me agreeing to "help with the friendship of friends," he called me "brother," but when talking about not helping him later, he spoke harshly, calling me "dog" and "Zhi Yu's flow." In this way, isn't Mr. Wu Cun's "righteousness" clear enough?</p>
<p>However, this also has a lineage. For example, if he wants to be Dian Wei, the gatekeeper for the master, he will not hesitate to praise me as Liao Hua, the "vanguard," and when he feels "enough suffering" after being skinned like a dog, he will scold me as a "scoundrel." He feels that "scoundrel" is still the opponent of "dog," so in order to confuse people's eyes and ears, he takes the preemptive measure of calling people "dogs." Like Mr. Wu Cun, he can only learn the "old methods." There is no "brilliant" method.</p>
<p>"If ×× doesn't agree, I hope he runs a director's school so I can worship him as an old man."</p>
<p>What is an "old man"? Only "the likes of Wu Cun" fully understand this. As for the "director school," it seems that "the theatrical predecessor Xiang Peiliang has already said that if you want to 'rebel' and 'roar,' please show your achievements on the stage.</p>
<p>(Confucius said: They are jackals of the same hill, why give many examples.)</p>

<p>The Lion's Roar Drama Society of this city, which has been clamoring for a long time, has decided to hold its first public performance at the Jincheng Grand Theater starting on the 30th of this month. The plays are Tian Han's "Death of a Famous Actor" and the famous play by the playwright Ibsen "Ghosts." The actors are all famous veterans of Northern and Southern drama working together. The wonderfulness of the performance is expected. Tickets are now on sale, and seat reservations are very enthusiastic every day. It is expected that it will be crowded during the performance. Those who want good seats should buy tickets early.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Bright Moon Will Hold a Large-Scale Public Performance <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Famous Movie Stars and Singers Participate</p>
<p>The Bright Moon Song and Dance Troupe, the birthplace of Chinese song and dance talents, has been established for fifteen years. To commemorate the occasion, a grand celebration will be launched, led by Li Jinhui, inviting famous movie stars and singers to perform. Participants include Li Minghui, Li Lili, Bai Hong, Li Mingjian, Zhou Xuan, Yan Fei, Yan Hua, etc. The programs arranged are wonderful and novel, and have never been seen before. The most magnificent and richest of them is the play "Peach Blossom Prince," which is enough to create a new record for the song and dance world. Li Minghui and Li Lili have not appeared on the stage for a long time. This decision to take the stage is a rare opportunity. It is heard that the performance location is at the Jincheng Grand Theater, and the date is set for the beginning of next month. It is expected that it will cause a sensation throughout Shanghai at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Ox Nose Second Collection Published <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>China's humorous comic clown "Ox Nose" is scattered in major graphic magazines in the North and South. Since the publication of the first collection, it has been popular throughout the country. The second collection is even better, with more sophisticated techniques, more refined lines, and more profound themes, making people never tire of watching it. The little Ox Nose is even more exciting, deeply containing serious training, but depicted with light lines, interspersed with four pages of large-scale grand scenes "Ox Nose's Grand Funeral," exquisitely crafted, with a variety of shapes and colors, full of fun. The back cover is even more valuable, with "Vegetable Ox Nose" and "God of Wealth Face" made of silver coins, which is extremely ingenious. The ordinary edition is only sold for fifteen cents, breaking all medical reports' low prices. It has been published on the 26th of this month and is exclusively sold by the China Book Company.</p>
