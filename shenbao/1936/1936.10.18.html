<h3 id="c41">敦槃影語（上）　中日外交之側面談 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>溯中日兩國唇齒比鄰，官謀相安，以利相需。乃是九一八事變突發以來，兩國於五年之間，雖外交之關係依然存在，而試一按其寳際，則自東三省以蔓延及於熱河全省，局部抗戰，前後累月。淞滬之役，展轉數旬。其所以刺激之者日深，則其所受之影響亦日大，因而至有其他不幸事件之發生。揆厥原由思可過半。卽就折衝方面言之，三年以前，行政院有駐平政整會之設立，軍事委員會亦在平特設分會，然情事糾結，環境日迫，所能探討切磋者，充類盡象，亦不過局部之事件。去年秋政整會撤消，更似有不可終日之勢，幾經盤錯，復有冀察政務委員會之產生，然權責所限，要多為當地之事項。如是者經歲累月，遂至中日之外交途徑依然存在，外交機關照舊往還者，而一提及外交之問題，卽感覺有無窮之困難，似此一部廿四史，有不知從何說起之概，寗非大可怪耶。此次兩國開始調整外交，迂回曲折，前途結果，初非局外人之所能預測。卽此半閱月間之折衝，因未屆公表時閒，亦自無從詳悉，然此事於國家前途，關係至鉅，尤為國人所樂知者。因自側面摭拾消息，訂證舊聞，知之罪之，厥在讀者。</p>
<p>此次中日交涉，大別言之可分為甲乙階段。蓋自日本提案起至於暫停談判止，可謂為甲階段。談判停正以後，蔣院長回京，川越大使謁談，以至於目下，可謂為乙階段。而此甲乙階段之中亦尙有側面之活動。現茲第二階段正在進行，而此後是否卽能就範，抑尙有其他之周折，則此時猶未易斷言。惟國人應自立限度，自守原則，其認為可以硏究者，要不離於此原則之外，否則惟有敬謝不敏，倘壁壘森嚴，則成績必好，亦國人所應共加勉策者也。</p>
<p>今試先言甲階段間之方式，向例外交有用書面，有以口頭，至於調整外交，從原則上言之，自以口頭為初步之探討。蓋一涉文字，便着跡相，不如言語之可以互道癥結，往復詰辨，使得眞相而探本源也，然因口頭詞令旣少範圍，遂易仲縮，過悄之語，失態之虞，自在所難免。而輕重緩急之閒，亦自大有區別，若並口頭者而不出諸一人之口吻，則為弛為張，更目不同。應付之道，厥惟自固陣綫，出以沉着堅毅之態度，不論對方之為一人或不止一人，而我儘可以　一人從容應付。今此甲階段之過程可為讀者報吿。則日本所提出以及我之對答均為口頭，惟彼所提出者，未必盡出於一人之口，而我則以一人之力應付之耳。</p>
<p>至於日本所謂外交方案之項目，最先多謂有七條，未經公表，無自列舉。而就兩國之報紙、以至路透等外電參證之，亦復各有不同，然其所不同者，不過項目之增减，而大要所述，不外於此。今姑卽就此大要各點，分別言之。並試述兩國立塲上之觀感，彼我之賓主旣屬異勢，則於外交之調整，亦自多荊棘，决非一朝一夕所易求得其結果，可斷言者。</p>
<p>各項目閒有最值得吾人注意者，厥維所謂華北明朗化之問題，此蓋中外各報所競傳者也。夫華北華南，不過地理上信口拈來之名詞，實則行省制度，隸屬中央，初無通假之餘地。三年以前，因長城戰役之際，行政院在平設立委會，此蓋政府於臨時籌固圉之計，亦未嘗以冀察各省認為有別加組織之必要也。卽軍事委員會之設立分會，所以指揮軍事，亦正如剿共時間之在各省設立行營，亦未嘗有絲毫政治分化之因素存在也。然當時以有此組織，而冀察之政務，乃至當地之小事，遂或集中於兩會，而兩會秉其樣職，亦自不能不對外為有限度之折衝。積重以還，於是日本乃認為華北政治之機構，必須由華北處理之，馴至引用當日臨時權職之子目，甚或至於　議而未嘗一日實行之子目，以為　當時旣有擬議，現則急待促行；不知所謂項目者，斗室數人籌思集益，初不得引為成案，亦且根本無成案之可言乎。在日人或以上交涉事項，在地方卽易於解决，至中央則難於遙斷，與其積成懸案，糾結不淸，不如中央畀地方以較大之特權，俾其有專即了，大事化小，共　蓋略有類於民十七年以前之東三省，但得張作霖一言，便司立决者。實則環境不同，政情已變，刻舟求劍，縱如所云，亦未必卽可大事化小，乃日本心目中以　冀察等省，毘連東省，而近者經濟軍事，益吿頻繁，必欲致明期之名，俾盡推行之實，此其根本上與我國之看法不同，蓋在我國以主權所在，根本不容他人之置喙，而集權分權，尤有國憲之成法，若謂應時勢上之需要，或及於特殊臨時之境　，亦當於不喪生權之原則下，試就適應環境之辦法，以謀充實北部行省之政治機構。奚得托於授權之名，而為削足適之計。此國人之所共信，亦政府方針之依歸，可為讀者報吿。至於冀省以內，另有冀東之非法組織，此更與我政制捍格，我方對此自更不能無言也。</p>
<p>防共問題，甚囂　上，具見報載。認為此决交涉中之要點。夫共黨問題，有軍事行動，有思想問題，吾國政制，根本與共產主義不同。而共產之軍事行動，則邇年以來，勦伐工作，彰彰在人耳目，何嘗不力，至於思想問題，則屬於學術思想界之範疇，別謀取締，又不當與軍事併為一談。乃日本此次以聯合防共為言，而且無確定之範疇，不知此事純屬內政，非他國所宜容喙，故調整外交案中，倘信有防共之一項，殊願發言者出以謹愼之態度，無轉生刺激，而使人懷疑陽言防共陰謀干政之實也。</p>
<p>關稅問題，亦為此中之一大端，然我國之困於協定關稅者已歷年所，幾經交涉，始得少脫範圍，求獲自主。然以視其他各國之壁壘，已感薄弱。去冬以還，日人多營走私，發朝　冀省，無遠勿屆，公然起運，武力抵抗，且一面巧立特殊貿易之名稱，一面又宣稱减稅之足以繁榮市塲，以為宣洩其工業製造品之尾閭。夫日本以工業立國，而原料復感缺乏，所支挹注者，以其製造資用之低廉，及世界市塲之銷路而已。夫以科學之技能，工價之低廉，而推銷貨品於世界市塲，但以實力為競爭，此固貿易之正道也。若必強人减稅以增加其銷路，又以走私為要挾减稅之初步，更進而欲打破，我自主關稅之原則，必使已解　者重加桎捨，此豈事理之平，自主原則，爭持歷刦，得之艱辛，渝主權論稅收，均無人願自返於桎梏，以自削其國權。宜乎此點之為我所拒郤，並同時以遏　走私為對案矣。</p>

<h3 id="c43">國民經濟建設運動與　推進農林生產建設 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— 曾濟寬</p>
<p>目前中國農村經濟破產，人民生活困難，以致國家民族前途，岌岌可危，唯一之急要問題，為如何增進生產，復興農村，使人民休餐生息，相與努力於國民經濟建設運動，向「盡人力，闢地利，均供求，暢流通，以謀國民經濟之健全發展」的總目標以邁進，以求達到復興民族之目的。茲以蘇省今後經濟建設之動向，注重於應用科學化之技術方法，以謀推進各種農林生產建設，然此與國民經濟建設運動，靡不息息相關，爰就其相互關鍵所在，略陳管見，以供探討。</p>
<p>國民經濟建設運動，簡單言之，卽是救貧運動，亦卽是救亡或復興民族運動。總理有云建設之首要在民生，民生卽人民的生活，國家的生存，社會的生計，羣衆的生命。」亦卽國民經濟命脈之所繫託，國民經濟發展，則民生樂利，民生　苦，則國民經濟隨之衰落，可見國民經濟建設運動之意義，在於喚起國民自覺之意識，團結整個民族之力量，作救亡圖存之奪鬬，其與普通人民為爭生存而奮鬬有不同之點，蓋此為有計劃有組纎的　養民力，利用民力，從事於各種生產建設運動，藉以促進國民經濟之健全發展，非若各個人之經濟活動，僅為無意識的自私自利的生產行為也。</p>
<p>吾人旣深明乎國民經濟建設運動之眞義，更進而講求國民經濟建設運動實施之方式和步驟，其方式雖不外利用合作系統，敎育系統，軍隊組織，學術機關與學術團體之協作，或產業團體與生產機關本身之自動各種，至於實施步驟，尤以積極從事於農林生產建設運動為最要之圖，良以吾國國民經濟之基礎在農村，農林生產减退，則農村經濟衰落，而國民經濟亦隨之不振，是以吾國人力財力，咸呈散漫無組織之現象。故欲圖農村經濟繁榮，固非積極改進農林生產不為功，然欲增進國家的財富，改善人民的生活，以謀國民經濟之健全發展，允非先求本國農林生產品之自給自足不可。吾國因受國際帝國主義經濟侵略之影響，生產亦不能自給，欲期達到普遍改進農林生產之目的，保存吾國國民經濟之命脈，勢非全國朝野上下相與努力，作復興農村運動不可，換言之，非合全國國民力量從事於國民經濟建設運動，不足以解决此增進生產，復興農村之問　也。</p>
<p>頻年以來，因吾國生產落後之故，以致國際資本主義之勢力，侵入我國農，農民飽受經濟壓迫，已足使中國農業生機毀滅無遺，推溯其源，實由於吾國農林生產建設太幼穉，且無健全組織，正有人未盡其力，地未盡其利之憾，欲圖挽救其弊，提偶農林生產建設，其組織與步驟必須劃一，然此需待於國民之共同努力，更為殷切。故凡各項農林生產建設，非透過整個之國民經濟建設運動，不足以發揮其宏偉效果，而奠　復興民族之初基也。</p>
<p>以提倡墾植言，欲促進墾植事業之發展，必有待於農業合作之推行，蓋運用合作組織，可使耕地集體化，工具機械化，採銷共同化。耕地集體化可免阡陌重疊，面積狹小，及地形不整齊之流弊，而實施適合經營規模之土地重劃　，更可利用農業機械，改良種植，達到增進生產之目的，採銷共同化則農民可得廉價之種籽肥料，减低生產成本，而且可以高價出售產品，免除行商中間之剝削及無謂之消耗。惟農業台作事業有助於墾　事業之進行固多，而需待於國民之共同努力，尤不可緩。蘇省江北濱海墾區，幅員遼闊，可耕而未墾之草地尙有六百萬畝以上，今後欲事開發以裕民生，首在利用農業合作方式，集中墾區附近民衆於共同目標，卽國民經濟建設運動為下手之道，蓋墾植事業，計劃久遠，必須合羣　羣力而為之，方克有濟。至於推行合作事業，尤須社會各種人士相互為用，使無對於合作事業有深切研究之先知先覺為之倡導，而後知後覺更缺乏有力之宣傳，必難使不知不覺大衆之實行力量集中，而期待事業之樂觀厥成，倘致力於國民經濟建設運動之結果，則先知先覺所倡導發明者，得後知後覺者努力宣傳之，不知不覺者竭力樂成之，不但合作事業可以順利推行，卽凡墾植工作亦得合羣策羣力，切實推進矣。</p>
<p>以興辦農出水利工程言，亦必須民衆有共同之組織，而　可以推行有效。良以水利工程為交通淞溉，防害之樞機，倘港道淤塞，洩水不暢，一遇霖雨，勢必汎濫成災，農業生產必無良果。去年洪水為患，受災區域遍於南北，而蘇省幸免於水災者，未始非政府與人民共同致力於水利建設之明效，可見農田水利工程，需要民力民財之切實合作，始能根本防治災害，增大生產效果，如是，則又非喚起國民，對於國民經濟建設運動有共同之認識，不足以提高其從事生產建設之興趣。</p>
<p>森林事業，直接影響於工業原料之供給，間接關係於水早災害之防除，佔國民經濟建設之最重要地位，然其見效遲而收到久，且非全國各地大規模營造森林，更不足以發揮直接閒接之效果，加以新植幼林，天生樹木，散漫於各地山野管理不易，非淞輸地方人民林業合作之智識，普遍提高其愛林思想，保護倍覺困難。然欲使全國民衆努力從事造林，並踴躍保護森林，僅恃政府法令頻頒官吏督促，難望有效，非使有密切關係之民力民財，規範　國民經濟建設運動之下，不足以資號召而促進森林事業之發展。</p>
<p>防治農林作物病蟲害，亦有各地共同一致之必要，蓋農作物及森林病蟲害，蔓延甚速，尤以蟲害為甚。防除之法，單就區域一地方實施，斷難奏效，務須聯絡有關各方面全體動員，同時一律驅除，始有根本肅淸之可能。各地農村人民，素乏防治病蟲害智識，鄰近遇有病蟲害發生，漫不經心，隔岸觀火，習以為常，是則减　各地農林作物病蟲害，以謀增進甚生產，必須先喚起各地人民作防治病蟲書運動，欲求達到此目的，又必須先致力於國民經濟建設運動，以促進其共同關係乃可。</p>
<p>辦理農業推廣，須普遍深入農村，改進農林生產，尤須使生產者樂於接受指導，方能收事半功倍之效。政府所設立之農林事業機關，引用專門人才，經多年試騐研究之結果，不無優良之種苗及種植方法，足資推廣，然欲使生產之農民樂於接受，而此良種美法，可以普週推行，不能單恃行政之力量，勢非利用合作農田方式，實施大規模推廣運動不可，而實施大規模推廣運動，則又須集中於國民經濟建設運動之共同目標，而注全力以深入農村，始能達到改良農業，增進生產之目的。</p>
<p>綜上論列各點，所賴以推行之人力物力，必須有適當運用之組織，尤須產業團體與生產機關之通力合作，以農林生產建設運動為前鋒，而以國民經濟建設運動為總推動力，聯合各界全體民衆，羣策羣力，分工合作，向同一總目標努力邁進，庶幾可達到國民經濟建設之最後階段，而民族復興之基礎，由是益加鞏固矣。</p>

<h3 id="c44">比國宣布中立之背景及其影響 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>前日比王召開內閣全體會議。宣言比國將恢復戰前的中立政策。這宣言的意義。卽等於比國聲明放棄其對於羅卡諾公約及一九二〇年法比軍事協定所負的責任。在目前歐洲幾個法西斯野心國家跋扈逞强。接連打擊到集體安全制度的時候。比國這樣變更政策顯然將引起嚴重的影響。現在法國政府已提出質問。英國當局雖保守緘默。而輿論界顯然也表示不小的驚愕。甚至歐洲整個的外交界。都將因這個突然的變動。而重行調整其方针。我們對於這個國際關係上的重要變化。應當明瞭其背景及可能發生的影響。</p>
<p>这次比王的宣布恢復戰前中文政策。其背景有兩個方面。一是國內的。一是國際的。在國內方面。我們可以從比國兩個主要民族的對外政策上。看出这次變化的原因。原來比國人民主要是屬於兩個民族的在靠近法國一邊的多為華侖族人（Walloons）在靠近荷蘭一邊的多為弗里明族人。（Flemiags）華侖族說法語.弗里明族說荷蘭語。他們對於法國的政策。有一種很大的分別卽華侖族是主張親法的。而弗里明族則反對親法。主張與荷蘭一樣以英國勢力為安全的保障。歐戰後此國鑒於已往戰爭的慘刦曾向英國提議締結軍事同盟但因種種關係未獲成功一九二〇年比國乃與法國締結軍事同盟。這同盟在華侖族方面。認為極大的勝利但弗里明族則始終堅持反對。不過戰後十餘年中。法國儼然成為歐洲大陸的盟主。他和比國的同盟關係並沒有因為弗里明族的反對而絲毫搖動可是在最近一兩年來。有兩種情勢的變遷。逐漸使反對親法者獲估優勢。一種是希特勒的接連破壞凡爾賽和約撕毀羅卡諾公約擴充海陸空軍。法國並沒有採取强硬政策來對付。這表示法國在大陸上的霸權已經旁落。一部分主張親法的比人也就開始搖動。另一種是法蘇互助協定成立後。比國的保守黨反動派方面。對法國發生了疑忌。疑是弗里明族的反對親法政策。忽然增加了許多擁護者。在本年五月選舉後荷蘭內閣成立以來。所謂「完全獨立」的外交政策已經啟示了對法疏遠的端倪。現在比王宣布變更政策。在國際間早就預料着的。</p>
<p>關於國際方面的背景。則英國和德國都不無關係。英國對於法國在大陸上霸權的嫉忌。在戰後的十餘年來。始終沒有變更。他的聯德聯意以制法。在意國侵阿的時候。雖有一度變更。但那是很暫時的。等到意阿戰爭終了。英國對於德國侵略政策的寬容。又是和以前一樣顯明了。所以對於未來的羅卡諾五强會議。英國曾經盡力使法國去遝就德國。而这次比國的恢復戰前中立政策。也許就是受了英國的影響。據外報消息。銳敏的觀察者都認為这次比王的宣言。在事前是和英國政府商得一致的。這在倫敦有力方面曾加以否認。但英國保守黨報紙對於这次事件的反應。表示加以「同情的」諒解。則蛛絲馬跡。顯然可尋了。對於德國。比國人民决不會懷有好感的。但今年五月以後。比國新出現一個里克斯黨。以一個靑年律師第格里爾為領袖。他的傾向和德國國社黨相類似。這當然不能就蹬明里克斯黨與德國有關係。但國社黨勢力的企圖侵入比國。在近幾年來一直是非常猛烈的。只要比國保守中立。對於德國的侵略政策就是有利的。</p>
<p>这次比國外交政策的變更其切迫的影響。是法國北部邊境的防禦力减弱。使德國對於法國的威脅又加强了一層。所以柏林對於比王的宣布表示滿意是當然的至於遠大方面的影響。則歐洲的集體安全制度。已遭受嚴重的打擊。卽使比國不更進一步。退出國聯。他對於目前世界的「不可分割」的和平運動。至少已退到消極的怠工的地位。今後歐洲戰爭的危機。將因而此益加迫近了。</p>

<p>四路軍之陣容</p>
<p>粤省軍隊，陳濟棠時代迭次擴充，最後共為五軍，每軍三師，合計十五師，兵額約十餘萬人，每月軍費六白餘萬元，及余漢謀任第四路軍總司令後，卽奉令將十五師縮編為十師，其番號則由第一師以至第十師，迨蔣委員長到粤，對於粤軍，予以整理，並將粤軍旗號與中央軍旗號，順序而下，尤其是革除地方性質的名稱，以示團結，故將粤軍第一師名稱，改為中央陸軍第一百五十一師，粤軍第二師名稱，改為中央陸軍第一百五十二師，依此以推至一百六十師，各師長初未更易，卽一五一師師長莫希德，一五二師師長葉肇，一五三師師長張瑞貴，一五四師師長巫劍雄，一五五師師長李漢魂，一五六師師長鄧龍光，一五七師師長黃質文，一五八師師長曾友仁，一五九師師長譚邃，一六〇師師長陳漢光，其後余漢謀對於各師長略有更動，蓋卽以陳章為一五二師師長，原任一五二師師長葉肇，改調為一六〇師師長，又以黃濤為一五七師師長，至原任師長之黃質文陳漢光，則改調為四路軍總司令部參議，粵省軍隊，雖經余漢謀之縮編與蔣委員長之整理，但裁汰之兵士，為數不多，各師兵額，視陳濟棠時期，較為充實，</p>
<p>四路軍總部，曾决定將全省劃為五個軍區，幷委定黃任寰張連繆培南李振球黃延楨五人為軍區司令官　五軍區之組織，與昔之五區綏靖　略同，原擬卽行籌設成立，嗣黃任寰等組織國考旅行團，旅行各省，內察軍事，是以軍區司令部之成立，將延至三個月後，目下全省綏靖事宜，悉由各師長奉余漢謀意旨行之，</p>
<p>四路軍總部，係由前第一軍部所擴成，余漢謀便是以第一軍軍長為四路軍總司令，卽李煦寰亦以第一軍秘書長而為四路總部秘書長、四路總部參謀長之職，原應由第一軍參謀畏羅梓材升充，但余漢謀則以徐景唐為四路總部參謀長，聞其原因，余與徐景唐實有換譜之雅，同時余以徐與桂省當局及李濟深等均有相當交誼，徐在粤省軍界，亦頗有資望，以之為四路總部參謀長，則應付各方面，較為裕如，惟羅梓材則自以為與第一軍有甚深歷史，四路總部參謀長一職，本人竟不能升充，頗為怏怏，因曾堅决請退，後余澳謀為調解誤會起見乃改以羅為敎導旅旅長、蓋余頗具苦心於其間也，又前一五七師師長黃質文，前一六〇師師長陳漢光，興陳濟棠關係，甚為密切，陳於下野後、曾令黃陳兩部矢志服從中央命令，陳濟棠並介紹香翰屛李揚敬二人於中央，請予以任用，中央均納之，是以任李為浙閩贛邊區勦匪總司令、並擬率黃陳兩師赴閩，嗣為該兩師四旅長通電堅持異議，李因未卽就職，未發，黃陳二人，遂解除師長之職，由余漢謀改以黃濤葉肇繼任，黃葉二人，與余漢謀情感彌篤，故粤省軍隊，經余漢謀一再措置，當甚團結矣、四路總部於編配十師之外，復在廣州近郊之燕塘前陳濟棠所設立之舊軍校，設立軍官團，將縮編各師之編餘軍官，以帶職支薪辦法，悉入該團訓練，將來或再調各師軍官入團訓練，以期各軍官得更深的造就，可見余漢謀之於四路軍，具有甚大的努力也。</p>

<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>開學又是一個多月了。小朋友們又在樂園裏，找尋快樂的生活。但是你們必須牢記住「求學愼始」這一句話，在此學期開始的當兒，應該多用點兒力，深深探求，細細研磨。甜的果兒，正等待你們去嘗。</p>
<p>小朋友們！別以為學期才開始，未來的時間很長，要用功的日子還多着呢！須知光陰易逝，一個學期轉眼便過去了。我們只有抓住現在，及時努力，才會得到滿意的開展。</p>
<p>曾參加過賽跑的小朋友，一定會想起，在五十米或百米賽跑的時候，槍聲一響，要不是立刻發腳，努力往前衝，便要趕不上人家而落伍的。求學也是這樣，要有好的開頭，才會有好的結果！</p>
<p>小朋友們！是時候了，努力呀！奮鬥呀！滿意的勝利，一定屬於你們的！</p>
<h3 id="c195">牙齒 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>近幾天來敏兒是患着牙齒痛，吃飯講話都很不便，眞使他受了極大的苦楚了，他便覺得為什麽會發生牙齒痛？以便後來可以預防。</p>
<p>「哥哥，牙齒痛這一件事比什麽疾病來得難受，到底它為什麽會發生的？」</p>
<p>「這因為食物是長久的嵌在牙齒縫裏，以致腐敗而發酸，使琺瑯質和象牙質漸次地剝落，並且影響到神經，於是便要發生牙齒痛了。」</p>
<p>「什麽呌琺瑯質？象牙質？」</p>
<p>「這倒要把牙齒的組成，大略的講一些給你聽聽：我們的牙齒分做門齒，犬齒，前臼齒，後臼齒四種，牙齒的組成：（一）露在牙肉外面的，可以看見的一部分的牙齒，呌做牙冠。牙冠是堅硬得像石頭一樣的琺瑯質構成牙齒的外層，這琺瑯質是人身上最硬的部分。（二）被牙肉嵌在顎骨裏的一部分的牙齒呌做牙根，像門齒犬齒等只有一個牙根，而臼齒有二三個牙根，牙根是由象牙質所組成。在象牙質的中間有一個髓腔，裏面滿貯着血管和神經。」</p>
<p>「牙齒的形狀，各有不同，因此分做我剛才講給你聽門齒，犬齒，前臼齒和後臼齒四種。門齒是像一柄小鑿子，因此可以咬斷食物。犬齒是圓錐形，可以咬碎硬的食物，前臼齒和臼齒都是臼形，能把食物再行磨碎。」</p>
<p>「我們的牙齒共有幾個？在幼孩時期的牙齒是不是和我們相同？」</p>
<p>「我的牙齒大約有三十二個，因為我已成人，門齒大約有八個，犬齒有四個，前臼齒有八個，臼齒有十二個。你的牙齒沒有確定數目，因為你還沒有成人。在幼孩時期的牙齒只有二十個，上顎十個，下顎十個，不過在幼孩時期所出的牙齒，呌做乳齒，等到七歲左右，乳齒就先後的自行脫落，而新牙也相繼的生出來，直到十二歲左右，乳齒就完全換新。這新出的牙齒，也就是每個人的永久牙齒，所以我們要好好的保護它。」</p>
<h3 id="c196">做一條美麗活潑的金魚 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭雲</p>
<p>門外來了一個賣金魚的，引起信兒迫着爸爸強要買。爸爸點點頭，思索了一會，很高興地說：</p>
<p>「信，假使把這金魚，買幾條回去，養在水缸裏，恐難使它日久生存，現在我有一條美麗，活潑，永不致死的金魚，你歡喜要嗎？但是要動動手。」</p>
<p>「要的，能得到一條金魚，無論怎樣都願。」</p>
<p>於是爸爸就開始告訴他怎樣動手？怎樣能得到一條美麗，活潑的金魚的方法：</p>
<p>拿一個雞蛋，用刀將它兩端，各鑿開一小孔，使裏面的蛋黃，白，一齊流出，再用畫紙，剪成魚尾，另用　綫一條，一端繫住魚尾的基部，一端由雞蛋較大一端穿進，通出他較小一端的小孔。再給一個比小孔稍大的實結；這樣，金魚的軀殼，已經做好。</p>
<p>第二部工作：用紅水涂在它的軀殼上，乾後，另用墨筆畫成魚的表面。那時可由魚尾基部的小孔，注入佔蛋殼內二分之一的沙泥，以保持與入水時的穩定；然後可用溶解的白蠟，涂住蛋大小兩端上的小孔。這樣，已　　　　　　　的金魚了。（見圖）</p>
<p>玩時：用一些肥皂，黏在魚尾基部下；放在水盆裏金魚籍着肥皂的奮發力，便能慢慢向前遊進；同時魚尾也能緩緩搖動。看去，很像一條美麗，活潑的金魚，在找它的同伴呢！</p>
<p>信兒照着爸爸的話，辦全了材料，動手一做；果然，現在他已有一條美麗，活潑，永不致死的金魚了。</p>

<h3 id="c198">船為何能在水中行駛？飛機為何能在空氣中前進？ <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 嚴懋德</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們總有如此的感覺着，為何船能在水中行駛？飛機為何能在空氣中前進？這是什麽道理？諸位小朋友恐怕知道他的理由很少，現讓我作簡單的說明一下：</p>
<p>人是沒有自動的能力，就是人要受別人的指揮，換句話說，人的行動，是被動的而不是主動的，牛頓在第一定律告訴我們說：「一切物體若不受外力的作用，靜止的永遠的靜止，運動的永遠作等速運動，這個關係，又稱為惰性定律。」因此物體有惰性的緣故，故要使物體運動，非加外力不可：</p>
<p>若人以力推物，蓋物體有惰性，物體好似有力以推入，其力與人所用的力相等。因此船在水中行駛，飛機在空氣中前進，是利用這個反力。因此船在水中時，是用以櫓划水，這是水起反力，使船向前行駛。而輪船是利用推進機，由兩塊或以上的金屬板裝在一軸的周圍，用發動機使其轉動，將水或空氣推向後方，由體的反作用，推進機被推向前進，以轉動軸的方向進行，水便推船前進。飛機亦利用推進機，當推進機轉動時，空氣推向後方，而使飛機前進；同時翼的下面所受的抵抗卽風的壓力，而且尾部沒有兩種的舵，一為水平舵，司機體的昇降，一為垂直舵，司機體左右進行的方向，飛機便是這樣飛翔的。</p>
<h3 id="c199">全國童子軍大檢閱歸來 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 雄風</p>
<p>我們的希望畢竟實現了，全國童子軍第二次大檢閱及大露營不知延擱了多少次，雙十節終於顯露了牠的雄姿在我們的首都。</p>
<p>這次大會使我們的腦海裏印上最深刻的痕跡的是蔣會長的神采，最使我們興奮的是防空表演，最使我們感到偉大的是我們童子軍團結的力量，最使我們感到興趣的就是營地的建築。</p>
<p>第一天跑到總辦事處，看到門前樹立着蔣會長縱馬指揮童子軍的圖像，這一幅偉大的畫面使我們感到興奮。到第二天會長又乘着飛機來營地低空飛行，歡迎之聲起於四野，後來我們才知道會長是剛從江西抵京，順便來營地視察的。在營地電影開放的時候，第一本就是獻機祝壽，那兒告訴我們蔣會長的豐功偉績，他那英武的神采，深深地印在我們的腦海裏，到第二天早上起來，第一個浮上心頭的意念，還是蔣會長那英勇的神態！在檢閱的一天，他穿了滿綴金帶的制服，顯出他特別地威嚴，當他在我們跟前走過的時候，倘然那不是莊嚴的檢閱典禮，我一定會發狂地歡呼起來。</p>
<p>全國童子軍的代表一萬多人集中到我們的首都，這正表示我們團結一致，準備着為國服務。我們在一塊兒露營，一塊兒遊戲，參加過勞動服務，舉行過營火大會，提燈遊行。尤其是東四省的代表也參加在我們的隊伍裏，更撥動了我們熱烈的情緒。少年有的是活躍的心，熱烈的血，進去的精神，蓬勃的朝氣，大家都說少年是國家的新細胞，民族的新血輪。這次的大集會，正表示我們復興國家一種新的力量。</p>
<p>營地的建設，使我們最感到興趣。營地中心的日規。人工寒暑表，氣象報告旗等等都是很新的設計。各單位營地的佈置，更是新奇偉大。有些地方好像一個小花園，有些地方却好像一個兵工廠。我相信這次參加大會的代表對於營地的佈置一定獲得不少經騐與見識。</p>
<p>到現在我們許多新交的朋友們又將勞燕分飛了。希望第三次大會將在最近期內舉行。有人說第三次大會將在遼寗舉行了。我們希望這句話能實現。</p>

<p>我拿了一根長條綫灰，一端繫於物上端，一端縛一小玩具，如不倒翁等類，或蓓制鵝眼錢四五枚均可，使之懸空，這時用火燃之，綫雖成灰，却不中斷，且所掛之物，仍懸空不掉落，眞是一件有趣的小玩意。</p>
<p>他的方法是用一根二三尺長的棉綫，浸在鹽水一夜，然後取出曝乾，另以雞蛋白將綫搽透，待其乾後，可以取玩，最奇怪的綫成灰時，我們用手指略碰，這時的綫　實變成了攤灰，在玩時他却能掛物不斷，這是奇妙非常，小朋友們，這種簡單且易於仿製的玩意，在閒暇時，何不去試騐一下呢</p>

<p>秋天到了，我們的旅行隊，又將開始活躍了！</p>
<p>昨天晚上，我們預備了一切；今天便辭別了父母，及一切親戚朋友，向着東南方旅行了。我們坐的是風先生的輪船。最初，我們到了我國第一大商埠—上海。當我行過上海時，受到很多的驚嚇。原來多黃浦江中，橫行的全是那些外國軍艦。他們的士兵，身上多穿着新式軍裝，手上拿的全是新式軍器，使我不敢停留。我們便向熱鬧地方去旅行。這一行，使我受到更大的驚嚇。因為，我們行過那地方時，只有那些碧眼黃髮的外國人在築砲台，堆沙袋，及戰掘壕。我們不知什麽道理：中國地方，會有外國人住，最後，我才知道了：原來是個租界。我嚇了，不敢停留，便再找較安靜的地方去。最後，找到一個太平的居留地，是一家誠樸的農夫園內。這園內沒有侵害我的東西，而且又很安靜清爽。所以我便住下，將永久地住下，做我的根據地，維持我的生活，養育我以後的子子孫孫了。</p>

<p>— 心青</p>
<p>他們一天又一天的繼續搜尋，但他們夫婦倆仍然沒有蹤跡，一般鄰人們拋開了自己因有的工作，一天天耐心地把蘭台一帶山徑上堆積着的雪一起　了開來，但是　連四五天，還是無形無踪。末後更用了許多狗領導着那些搜尋的人，尋到山徑以外的遠處去。忽在一個巉岩的頂上，起了一聲很響朗的呐喊聲，才知道那一對迷失的夫婦，已經找到了。山蘭葛林腎身上裏着伊的丈夫的大衣，直僵僵地躺在那裏，當然是早已死的了。在一座岩石的下面，發見了喬治葛林的屍體，瞧伊那　着的姿勢，分明是從山上面。滑跌下來，　　就跌死了的。鄰人們推想那夜他們倆倆定是被大雪加大霧迷住了路，因此漸走漸遠，直到那黑暗的巉岩上去，喬治葛林走前了幾步，想去探尋前面有沒有路，不料踏出岩外，就失足踏了下去。山蘭也許還沒有知道這回事，仍立在原處，淒慘地高喊着伊的丈夫，可是在這深夜大雪之中，蘭台方面的人，那裏會聽得呢。到得伊聲嘶力竭，不能動彈時，就躺　那裏等候伊的丈夫，終於生生地凍死了。據一般熟悉他們夫婦倆的人推想起來，那時那可憐的山蘭一定記掛着家裏許多孩子們，心煩意亂催促着伊的丈夫趕快回去，以致使他也失去了鎭定的功夫，要是他一個人，那麼決不會鬧出這禍事來的。那勇敢的小安葛妮在家裏守護着伊的六個弟妹，不慌不忙，等候着父母回來，到了末後又才彳亍在雪地裏獨自出去找尋，這分明是賦有伊父親的那種軍人的遺傳性，這眞是不可多得的。英國大詩人華士華斯的妹妹樂珊曾去訪問小安葛妮，聽伊把那一切的經過訴說出來，認為這是一件很可寶貴的事情。</p>
<p>在一個可愛　春天，葛林夫婦倆就在茍克鎭中的聖　斯瓦墳塲裏安葬好了。華士華斯曾寫了一首詩追悼他們倆。葬禮終了以後，鄰近的農人門都願意收養七個孤兒做他們的義子義女，那一對雙生的女孩，仍在一起，歸　家收養甘絲玲就由華士華斯家領去，小安葛尼雖和伊的弟妹們分了手，却很想安適的在伊們父女的朋友們家裏過活，遠近的人聽得了這段故事，都出錢捐助，紛紛的送來。王后賈綠德和伊的公主們也被小安葛妮的勇敢所感動，賜下一筆很厚的慰藉金，分給那些孤兒。各地的民衆便聞風而起，金錢像雪片似的飛來，可是桃榮珊華士華斯女士却一槪拒絕，因為伊想孤兒們倘得了太多的錢，將使伊們長大起來，沒有了進取之心，這是和伊們的前　很有影響的。</p>

<h3 id="c204">「中日報紙成立聯繫」 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 梁伯勳</p>
<p>自京滬各報於中日關係緊張中發表共同意見與信念，並警告全國人民及日本朝野之後，各地新聞界卽紛紛響應，可見我國人民對於當前之中日問題具有同感。在日本方面，於此中日關係緊張之際，亦有値得吾人注意之言論，這便是最近「東洋經濟新報」總主筆石橋湛挾氏所發表之文字：「為調整中日關係對報界聯繫之希望」（該文大意載於十月十三日之「申報」上）。石橋氏在該文中斥責日文報紙對京滬及粵漢等報聯署發表之通電置若罔聞；並指出「日本報紙日以破壞日本與外國間關係為能事，而絕無些微維持國際關係之意向；日本報紙現抱極端的愛國主義，幾已成為官僚政治之外交機關」。對於中日談判前途，氏亦表示深切之憂慮，謂「如日本交涉之策略，證明其為笨拙者，則二十一條要求之危險殆將重演，而日本之大不幸將較中國為尤甚！又謂外相有田九月二十八日之宣言，　明於責人，昧於責己」。此種評論若出於我國人民之口，或將被指為「排日思　」之表露，但今發此言論者為日本新聞界之有名人物石橋氏，不知「友邦」人士對此將有何說。同時石橋氏在該文中更誠摯希望兩國報紙成立諒解，「一方中國報紙不刋載排日新聞，一方日本報紙不對中國作惡意之批評，並相信如兩國報紙成立聯繫，則可促進兩國關係之改善」。如此種希望能成為事實，當然亦為吾人所　聞。不過，依據過去事實和目前形勢，吾人尚有幾點意見在這裏提出討論。</p>
<p>第一，所謂「排日新聞」不知究竟何指。若謂中國報紙刋載某國侵略吾人之土地的消息，刋載我國人民之愛國行動，發表保護我國領土和主權之完整的言論，卽為排除某國，那便無異禁止中國報紙和中國人民愛中國的見解，吾人絕對不能接受。自然，所謂「極端的愛國主義」，侵略鄰國以自肥的愛國主義，向為中國報紙和中國人民所鄙棄，但對於中華民族的獨立，國家的主權，却非一致擁護不可；倘有一個國家實行掠奪吾人之國土和權利，並欲強迫吾全國人民受其支配，則吾四萬萬同胞必將一致恨之，仇之，並與之奮鬥到底！此種為民族獨立而奮鬥之表現，為國家領土及行政之完整而奮鬥之精神，當為全世界所稱贊，亦為吾國人民所絕對保存者。若當強鄰抱着「極端的愛國主義」，侵略我國主權之際，而欲吾人放棄此種為民族獨立而奮鬥之偉大精神，寗非怪事！</p>
<p>第二，若中國報紙果眞刋載所謂「排日新聞」，則吾人當請日本人民及一般明達之士如石橋氏者，注意此種所謂「排日新聞」之來源。中國民族並非以侵略他人為能事之民族，絕不願無端排外「排日」的。假使要將中國人民正大光明之愛國運動認為「排日」行為，並以之為改善中日兩國關係之障礙時，則日本人民及一般明達之士便應考慮日本政府和軍人是否有侵害中國領土和行政之完整的行動，是否眞的以「平等原則」來調整兩國之關係。若事實的答復是一「有」字和「否」字，則中日關係之惡化，中日兩大民族情感之不調和，其責任便全是日本；而日本人民及一般明達之士若欲使中日關係改善，亦當設法糾正日本軍政當局對中國之態度。</p>
<p>第三，對於日本報紙，吾人未便有所評論。不過，若石橋氏所言均係事實，卽日本報紙均是「抱極端的愛國主義」，「以破壞日本與外國間關係為能事」的「官僚政治之外交機關」，則欲使「中日報紙成立聯繫」，亦當首先注意日本報紙之態度。若日本報紙永遠都如石橋氏所評論者，則中日報紙卽永無「成立聯繫」之可能。因我國人民及報紙向抱愛己而不侵犯人的態度，對於以平等待我之國家亦以誠摯，以平等，以和平待之，此在過去和現在事實中均有充分之表明；若令這樣的人民與報紙去與石橋氏所評論的那種報紙「成立聯繫」，在事實上豈有可能耶？</p>
<p>總之，中華民族乃不侵略他人之民族，中國人民愛自己的國家和其自身，也愛和平與自由，若日本能與中國平等相處，不損害中國領土與行政之完整，不侵略，守信義，則吾人必可與之平等相處，共維東亞和平。若日本報紙能放棄石橋氏所評論的那種態度，能眞正依據「平等原則」為改善中日關係而努力，則中國報紙自會與之合作，「成立聯繫」。目前中國人民已有充分之覺醒和認識，已知國家民族已處於最後的生死關頭，非各階層一致團結，抵禦外侮，不足以圖生存，在此情形下，若日本取壓迫威脅之姿勢以對付中國人民，是必為我四萬萬同胞所難忍受，其結果必會使遠東和平根本破壞，招來東亞兩大民族相互殘殺甚至因而引起世界大戰之慘禍。此在中國，自然未必是幸事，但對於日本之不幸，誠如石橋氏所言，恐「將較中國為尤甚」！</p>

<p>— 及民</p>
<p>意大利羅馬通訊</p>
<p>梵諦岡是羅馬的三大建築物之一，是羅馬教皇所居住的宮殿。它在羅馬市的西端，約佔四五萬平房米的地域。一九二九年，意大利與教皇在羅馬締結條約，劃設梵諦岡市。在這個市中　教皇自有政治上的主權，所有市中的數百市民都在教皇管轄之下，與羅馬市的行政沒有關係，雖然這地方是在羅馬市中。同時，教皇在西歐各國，在南美，他都派遣的有大使；當什麽祭節到來時，歐美許多國家都要特　招待他的使臣的。</p>
<p>因為時間關係，我們沒有進謁教皇，所以我們不能在這裏談他的丯采儀容；我們所要說的，知識梵諦岡建築的莊嚴和它的一切古蹟名勝，因為這些雖然都是宗教意識的表現，却也有很大的文化意義的。</p>
<p>所　梵諦岡，　意義便是法王的宮殿，法王的政府。包括在梵諦岡市的，有聖彼得寺，法王宮，美術館，圖書館，禮拜堂，庭園等。我們在羅馬去參觀梵諦岡，一下電車，出現在眼前的，便是一個有整齊美觀的走廊圍着的橢圓形廣塲。在走廊的屋頂上站立着一百六十三個聖者像，特別惹人注意。至於那橢圓形的廣塲之大，則是長徑為三四〇米，短徑為二四〇米；它廣闊地展開在地上，好像捕魚的網，把來訪的人一個一個地吞了進去。據說這廣塲是十七世紀意大利巴羅克的代表作家伯爾尼設計的。在廣塲的中央　立着從埃及運來的方尖塔；它的左右設置的有兩個噴水的清泉，向着南歐的空中噴出白色的水烟。</p>
<p>在廣塲的正面，便是聖彼得寺。這個寺院所佔的面積有一五一六〇平方米突，是經過了由十五世紀中葉到十七世紀末的長時間才完成的。其建築之莊嚴偉大，於此　可想見。　參觀這個寺院的，站立在廣塲上，首先當然會要看到它那好像球蓋似的圓屋頂。屋頂上有一個大的十字架，使每一個耶穌的信徒都要望而起敬。據說這個圓圓的屋頂，是文藝復興期中偉大的藝術家米格爾基羅晚年設計的，眞可說是高貴的藝術珍品。走進寺院，抬頭觀看那圓屋頂的裏面，馬上便可以看到基督，聖瑪利亞及大使等的聖像。在整個寺院的內部，有無數的藝術珍品，這可說是文藝復興及巴羅克時代的藝術寶庫。如米格蘭基羅在一四九八年作的大理石雕刻「彼達」，便是文藝復興期中的代表的藝術品；伯尼爾作的飾在大祭壇上的青銅天蓋（高二九米）也是代表十七世紀的巴羅克的，此外還有許多名貴的藝術品，不能一一列舉。</p>
<p>出聖彼得寺，從他的左面繞着後方走到右面，便是長方形的美術館。一走過這美術館與寺院相接處的大門，你首先可以看到的是那古風的守兵，這會使人發生離開現實的感覺。美術館並不是很單純的，它包括着走廊，禮拜堂以及法王宮殿有關的許多建築物。這裏的法王宮殿是從一三七七年法王古勒戈利阿由南法蘭西移來的，以後各代法王又將這宮殿增築和改修，才像現在這樣子。</p>
<p>梵諦岡的每一件房屋的壁面和屋頂，都經過文藝復興時代畫壇巨匠的裝飾；如果你要通觀這些繪畫，那至少也有費一天的工夫。現在我們且將其中最名貴的藝術品舉幾種出來罷。</p>
<p>首先値得特別提說的，是畫聖拉斐爾在這裏留給我們的藝術遺產。當十六世紀之初，正是藝術的保護者法王雨呂二世的時代，他的宮廷便是當時最高文化之中心。拉斐爾這時才二十九歲，　未有什麽　名；他本來是住在弗洛倫斯，一五〇八年九月應法王之召才赴羅馬。從這個時候起，他的一生精力就供獻給梵諦岡的壁畫了。他在尼古拉士五世的室壁上描畫的，最有名者是以九世紀的一種傳說　題材的「波爾果的火災」，象徵加特力教的勝利的「聖餐典禮的討論」，以希臘諸神的團聚為主體的「巴爾納梭斯」，謳歌古達雅典學藝之興盛的「雅典的學院」等；在這些有名的繪畫中，我們可以看出中世紀以來傳統的基督教思想與再生的古代異教文化相和諧的文藝復興期的文化的形態。</p>
<p>畫聖拉斐爾的那些名畫中，「聖餐典禮的討論」和「雅典的學院」尤有高貴的藝術價値。前者的人物共分為天界與下界兩種；在下界的人羣中，可以看到但丁和沙弗拉羅，也可以看到拉斐爾的相知建築家布拉曼特。這個作品的意義不消說是象徵加特力教神學的勝利的。至於「雅典的學院」，則是象徵科學的勝利的；在這中間，有以柏拉圖和亞里士多德為中心的古代希臘許多著名哲學家和科學者，也可以看到拉斐爾自己的容顏。這兩幅畫都是藝術史上最有名的作品，凡是來訪梵諦岡的人都要特別鑒賞它們。</p>
<p>此外，在被稱為「拉斐爾廊」的室內，還有拉斐爾畫的新舊約書全約　塲面；這也是很有名的偉大作品。</p>
<p>復次，是在一四七三年西克司四世建立的斯基那禮拜堂內的許多名畫。這些名畫大多是一四八一年—八三年的作品，都以摩西傳和基督為主題的，它們的作者是培爾基洛，賓列喬，波吉爾利，西牛勒里等。同時，在這禮拜堂內的圓頂上，還有一五〇八—一〇年米格爾基羅的繪畫。這繪畫的主題是由舊約聖書選來的，在它的周圍有七個預言者和五個女預言者；還有許多羣衆，都是露出有力的筋骨的裸體像，他們跳動着，各自顯出不同的姿勢，表現出感傷的情調。</p>
<p>同時，在禮拜堂的正面祭壇的大壁上有米格爾基羅在一五三四—四一年畫的大壁畫，那便是有名的「最後的審判」。這幅畫高二十米，寬一〇米，就中繪着一大羣裸體表現出的戲劇的塲面，另有一羣裸體大衆的奏樂所。其布置之偉大，表現的生動，實是近代繪畫史中所不易多見的。</p>
<p>美術館共分為三部分，一是陳列埃及，希臘，愛多利亞，羅馬等古代的藝術品的，其次是以從十三世紀到十六世紀的意大利繪畫為主的陳列室，另外便是拉斐爾繪畫的陳列室。在這些陳列室中，除陳列着上述那些藝術品外，還有許多藝術上寶貴的遺產，不過這裏不能一</p>

<p>一詳談了。</p>
<p>此外，在圖書館中，藏有五萬冊貴重的寫本以及許多有歷中價値的書翰，這也是梵諦岡所有的貴重物品，當然也是每一個到這兒來參觀的人所特別留意的。</p>

<p>— 錢伯明譯</p>
<p>你曾想到過嗎，親愛的讀者，鼻子這器官是多麽可欽佩呀？</p>
<p>鼻子；是的，鼻子。正是鼻子這件東西，對每一篗動物是多麼的有用呀，就像奧維特（羅馬詩人—譯者）所說的，把牠的臉孔抬上天國！</p>
<p>呀，這似乎是可怪的，是天大的忘恩負義，竟沒有詩人曾想到為鼻子寫下一首抒情詩！</p>
<p>因此這工作留給了我，不過我並非詩人，我只能要求把我列在我們最最偉大的詩人們之後，而接受這麽一個意見。</p>
<p>確然，鼻子是不幸的。</p>
<p>為眼睛，已造出這末許多東西：歌曲，祝辭及萬花鏡，圖畫，風景及奇觀。</p>
<p>為耳朶的：耳環當然不用說，此外還有斯屈萊第范里斯梵哦林，伊拉爾特鋼琴和薩克斯喇叭。</p>
<p>為嘴巴的：有四旬齋（耶穌復活節前四十週日的宗敎禮節—譯者）淸淡的烹調，食物學者的食譜，美食家的飲食辭書。他們為它調製各色各樣的羹湯，自俄羅斯肉湯以至法蘭西捲心菜湯；給嘴巴的許多食品也和最偉大的人物底聲名相關，自蘇別士薄肉片以至李曉路布丁：它的脣同珊瑚相比，牙齒和珍珠相此，呼吸和香氣相比。先前，它已吃過未去羽毛的孔雀，吃過未抉去臟腸的鷸鳥；至於將來，它還有吃各種烤百靈鳥的希望。</p>
<p>可是，為鼻子曾創造出什麽事物來呢？只有玫瑰油和鼻烟。</p>
<p>其實，鼻子對於你是最忠實的。眼睛睡了，嘴巴閉了，耳朶不聽見了，而鼻子則常時在服務中。它照顧你的安睡，且有助於你的健康。脚，手，以及身上其他一切部份全都是遲鈍的。手時常做出愚蠢的舉動，脚則顚蹶，為了它們的笨拙而讓身子跌倒了。當它們如此做了時，牠們倒可逍遙自在，而可憐的鼻子却為它們的過失而受罰。</p>
<p>你沒有慣常聽得說：「某某先生破了鼻子啦」嗎？</p>
<p>溯自開天關地以來，已有極多極多的破鼻子了。但誰能舉個簡單的例證，證明破了鼻子是它自己的過錯呢？沒有。雖則如此，然而可憐的鼻子却還是常常被叱駡的。</p>
<p>呀，這些它全都以天然的忍耐性忍耐着。確然，它有時要無禮貌的打鼾；可是你曾在什麼地方，什麽時候聽得你自己的鼻子打鼾呢？</p>
<p>現在，且讓我們把鼻子的效用忘記一忽兒，而僅由美學上作着眼點來注意它。</p>
<p>鼻子好像是利巴能山上的一棵杉樹，踐踏着底下的一簇鬚疵；一根中心柱子，它支持眉毛的兩個弓形物。在它的中心點，棲止着敏銳的思想；一笑便皺起來。偉子的康特底鼻子—他的偉大實實在在是由於他的鼻子得來的—在萊恩斯及洛克洛埃地方，當西班牙人侵入時，在那裏牠們的征服者勇敢地揮舞着命令之杖，偉大的康特的鼻子先於他人而入，也先於偉大的康特自己。杜茹仲的鼻子突出於衆人之前，他的鼻子懂得怎樣做二十四種不同式子的扭　，並且一次有趣一次。</p>
<p>不，我不信鼻子該被入們忘恩負義而迄今還被迫地留於黑暗之中。</p>
<p>我提出一個理由，為什麽鼻子會委屈於這不公平之下，事實是因為西方的鼻子是這樣的小。</p>
<p>若果西方的鼻子是唯一的鼻子，那是多可怕的事呀。可是那些東方的鼻子，尤其是喬治亞（舊俄羅斯地名—譯者）的鼻子，却都是極漂亮極巨大的鼻子。</p>
<p>巴黎，維也納，和聖彼得堡的紳士們，你們曾疑問過自己的鼻子底優越嗎？在那種情形之下，我的維也納朋友們，打多瑙河去；你們這些巴黎人，乘輪船去；聖彼得堡人們，架雪撬去；都說這簡單的辭句：「去喬治亞。」</p>
<p>不過，我豫先警吿你會得到奇恥大辱的。你卽使帶了歐洲最巨大的鼻子中的一個，到第夫利斯（近喬治亞的地名－譯者）城門口，那裏的人也會驚異地凝視着你而說：「多可憐呀，這位紳士先生在路道上把鼻子掉了。」</p>
<p>啊，老天爺－這些美麗的喬治亞鼻子！强壯的鼻子，偉大的鼻子！有各種形式：圓的，胖的，長的，大的。有各種顏色：白色，淡紅色，深紅色，紫羅蘭色。有些裝上紅玉，有些裝上珍珠；我瞧見有一個裝上綠松石。</p>
<p>在喬治亞，范克唐四世（舊俄時代的皇帝名。—譯者）廢止了米突和碼制，而只留用鼻子制。一切貨物都要用鼻子來衡量。他們說：「我買十七鼻子法蘭絨做寢衣，七鼻子呢做一對褲子，一鼻子半緞子做領結。」而且在一般喬治亞太太們，還覺得這種衡量較之歐洲的衡量更來得便當呢。</p>

<p>— 森然</p>
<p>—發行所本埠愚園路愚谷邨　十號，定價每冊　角—</p>
<p>「宇宙風」在一般讀者的印象中，似乎是弄幽默的刋物；只要一提到它，人們　是會要想到「論語」的。然而，在我看了第二十六期的「宇宙風」之後，覺得並不幽默，雖然編輯人還是那幾位有名的幽默大師。這是什麼道理呢？我們不大明白；也許是由於幽默大師們的感覺銳敏，覺得在目前情形下來說風凉話是有點「此路不通」吧。</p>
<p>第二十六期的「宇宙風」來了一個特輯，這是緊接着第二十五期來的，總題為「日本與日本人特輯下」。就中所談的大多是日本的文化和日本人的生活。至於該刊發行這個特輯的意義，那是可以在這幾句話中看出來的：「如有人因為喜愛日本的文明，覺得他一切都好，對於其醜惡而加以迴護，又或因為憎惡暴力的關係，翻過來打倒一切，以為日本無文化，這都是同樣的錯誤。」這是周作人先生的「談日本文化書中的詞句，該刋特別把它摘錄下來，用紅字刊在封面上的；其用意不消說是在吿訴我們：該刊所以要刊行那個特輯以及它對於問　的態度，都可以由周先生那幾句話來表明。如果更將那幾句話的含羅引伸出來，並與這期特輯的內容聯繫起來解說，那使是在喚起我們對於日本文化和日本人的生活之注意，要我們知道它的好壞長短，用以糾正自己的壞處，補救自己的短處。這種表現當然未可厚非　不過，我們讀了　期宇宙風的特輯之後，首先感到的，却是特輯所說的那些日本文化和日本人的優點，有些是並不値得稱贊，更不値得我們取法的。例如，「日本的婦女生活與娛樂」一文，就大吹特吹日本婦女是如何的「勤儉柔順」，如何的有「禮節」，甚而至於稱贊到日本女店員的「跪地叩送一客人，下女的「跪叩深謝一客人的賞金，說這是招待客人的周善」，是懂得「禮節」的表現。不錯，日本婦女的確有許多好處，勤儉」，「柔順」和講「禮節」，也是可以稱贊的，但像那樣的侍奉男子，像那樣的向客人「跪叩」，似乎也太「柔順」，太　禮節、了一點。婦女也是人，並不楚奴隸，為什麽只是為了討男子或客人的歡喜而就去向人「跪叩」？中國婦女雖還未脫離舊禮敎的束縛，但還沒有「</p>

<p>跪送」男人，這一點也可說是中國婦女不如日本婦女的地方吧，可是我們的女同胞似乎還未因此就感到慚愧，當然也就沒有去向日本婦女學習「跪叩」的必要了。這樣，那特別稱贊日本婦女善於「跪叩」的必要了。這樣，那特別稱贊日本婦女善於「跪叩」的文字，還有什麽意義呢？</p>
<p>說到日本人的娛樂，有些也的確比中國的高尚幽雅，但中國人的娛樂業並不是一點都不足道。例如近年來中國的電影（假使電影也可說是一種娛樂的話）就很進步，有些影片甚至可說是比日本還好的。可是，「日本的婦女生活與娛樂」的作者除對日本的關於科學和軍事的電影大加贊許而外，對於中國的影片則一槪否定，盡都說得一錢不値。他說道：「他們（指日本人）的電影是關於科學，軍事片子居多，如潛水艦的製造使用，坦克車的作戰威能，飛機的偵察敵情破壞敵方等，都是牠主要的題材。很不及我國能夠把這種極科學的教育工具，專門製造成「引誘人向墮落道上走」的勾當。你們不信的話，只看這國難嚴重到了萬分的當兒，他們認為最時髦最受人歡迎的是那些片子，不用說，不是肉麻誨淫的愛情影片，就是哄死人不抵命的迷信傑作；除此以外，我國電影公司也無此資力辦到，卽能辦到，而不合一般民衆的脾胃也恐怕不容易撈回本兒來哩。」這樣說來，中國的影片便都是「肉麻的愛情影片」和「哄死人不抵命的迷信傑作」了，而且這些都是由於一般民衆的要求產生的，一切責任當然都應由民衆來負。我不知道這位先生看過近年來的國產影片沒有，據我們所知道的，如「漁光曲」，「自由神」，「桃李刦」，「迷途的羔羊」等影片，甚至可說是為一般外國影片所不及；還有那些「演不出的」戲劇和電影，更是適合當前的急需的。可是，這位先生沒有注意到，全部地把所有國產影片都否定了，這眞令人難解！至於日本的那些表現「飛機的偵察敵情破壞敵方」的影片，在我們看來，那是與其國情一致的，對於中華民族的解放都有很大的關係，但這位先生却並未把那意義明白指示出來，以喚起國人和世界的注意；他指示一味贊揚：這也使我們有點莫名其妙！</p>
<p>周作人先生在「談日本文化書」中，當他談了一些日本文化的優點之後，便說道：「這裏想順便一提的，便是談這些文化有什麽用處。老實說，這沒有用處。好的方面未必能救國，壞的方面也不至賣國。近時有些時髦的呼聲，如文化侵略或文化漢奸，不過據我看來，文化在這種關係上也是有點無能為力的。」因此，這期「宇宙風」的特輯雖向我們介紹了一些日本的文化情形和日本人的生活狀況，但並未將這些與目前中日關係緊密地聯繫起來談論；甚至連日本在文化方面對付我們的許多表現也未提及。這種情形更使我們不能不說這個特輯是沒有現實的積極作用的。</p>
<p>同時，這個特輯所講述的日本文化，也只是那些作者每個人的零碎印象，並未能使我們對日本文化有一個全般的理解；而且，他們所講的那些日本文化現象還只是極表面的，並未能更深刻的探究出為什麽日本會有那些文化現象。例如，他們指出日本接受西洋和中國文化，並將之構成自己的文化。但日本何以能這樣？這當然只有從它的社會發展去說明，因為一定的文化現象乃是由一定的社會形態產生的；就是一個國家之接受他國文化，也是由於兩者的社會形態有某些類似才有可能，否則也是無法接受的。把高爾基的小說拿到美洲未開化的印第安人中去高聲誦讀，那些人並不會一下就去接受那小說中的思想而成為最進步的人羣；把美利堅的大機器運一批到青海內蒙去，那裏也不會一下就能變成最高的資本主義社會，接受美國文化。這是什麽道理呢？一句話說完，便是由於兩者沒有類似的社會生活，沒有生活類似的人羣。「宇宙風」指出日本接受東西文化，但沒有說明它的社會的本質與夫它和西歐以及中國社會之關係，所以使我們看來只能表面地知道一些日本的文化現象，並不能對牠有深刻的了解。</p>
<p>自然，特輯所載的某些日本文化現象，某些日本人生活的長處，例如日本的進步的文學，許多藝術的技巧，日本報章雜誌的樣式和其各方面的技術的講求，以及日本人生活的勤儉等等，都是我們所當學習的。不過，依我看來，學習日本人的長處自然可以，但在目前情形下，只是表面地去學習那些也並不能使我們富強起來。戊戌政變，辛亥革命以來，我們不是就在努力歐化嗎？但結果在一方面自然是有些好的收穫，但在另一方面不是產生了洋買辦的洋化生活，和一般洋塲惡少的浮華嗎？不是使得我們的文化有許多地方有許多地方日益表現成為殖民地化嗎？這原因便是在於國家民族獨立的根本問題未得徹底解決，不能溶化他人的東西而為己有。因此，在目前的中國要談接受他人文化，便須和國家民族獨立的根本問題放在一起來談才有積極意義。但關於這一點，「宇宙風」的特輯是未辦到的。</p>
<p>除特輯之外，這期「宇宙風」中還有幾篇文章倒是値得一讀的，如連載的郭沫若先生的「北伐途次」，老舍先生的「駱駝祥子」，雖然在這期中我們只看到一部分，但也感到了這兩篇作品的好處。還有老向先生的「趕考記」，何容先生的「監考記」，與夫亢德先生的「和氣救國」，黎庵先生的「風化」，芣等先生的「廢學就試」等短文，也都是很不錯的；尤其是那幾篇描寫和評價我們的考試制度的文字，寫的眞實動人。依據這些，我們在這裏仍有理由說：「宇宙風」也有它的好處；比較起「論語」來，是要進步得多了。至於上述的關於它這期的特輯的缺點，那也是就它的某些表現的一種批判，並不就是說這刋物全有毒汁，不可一讀。反之，比較起那些以肉麻當有趣，專講什麽人體美一類的刋物，乃至那些流行的紳士刋物來，「宇宙風」却是有它値得推重之點的。</p>

<h3 id="c210">雞鴨行 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 朱慰元</p>
<p>「殺雞為黍」，成了一句敬客的老話。同時，上海人添菜中的「白斬雞」，「燒鴨」，「醬鴨」；廣東街上的「油雞」；南京人所開的「鹹水鴨」，「鴨肫肝」店；北平山東人開的京館裏的「塡鴨」「烤鴨」；徽館裏吃的「鳳凰餛飩」（一雞一鴨合燒一鍋）；這些玩意都是表明家畜中的雞鴨和人們在如何發生着密切關係。</p>
<p>上海的新式養雞塲確是一天多似一天了，頗引起社會人士的注意，訪問介紹，大有其人。本文則是專門介紹舊式的雞鴨貿易行家的情形。初秋七月半到九月半的這個時候，正是雞鴨鵝買賣最旺盛的時候（春季最清淡）。交易的總數，本埠南北市（十六鋪與董家渡）與浦東，塘橋等地，由行家經手的，價値約一百數十萬元；此外有數十萬或不投行，或由規模較小之行經手，合計二百餘萬元。為什麽秋季最旺盛呢？據說春季最清淡的原因，為了冬季人家所儲的臘味（如風雞，醃肉，香腸之類）還未吃完，等到臘味吃完了，又已到逐漸天熱的時候了，人們又不大喜歡吃油膩，而要多吃素小菜了。等到夏季已過，秋風送涼，胸襟朗爽，胃口必開，所以這個時候，無論什麽人都要大吃大喝，講求口福。美味的雞鴨當然是意中的對象，而這時的菜館中，烹調也更討人歡喜。據一般雞鴨商老吃客和廚房司務談起了本市的雞鴨品種，頗為有趣，現在且把雞鴨的出產地方和從來貿易習慣的大略情形叙述如下：</p>
<p>（一）浦東雞　又名本地雞，其體形呈四方狀，頗笨重，毛疏鬆而色彩不一，以黃色而毛綠有黑色成斑駁者為多，普通多有腳毛，頗像洋種。體重有至八九斤重者，故又名九斤黃。其孵雛及抱子觀念甚發達，肉味頗佳，如能設法改良，可成一種良好的肉用雞，不難與外國之Cochin（交趾雞）並駕齊驅呢。</p>
<p>（二）崇明雞　體形與本地雞相似，毛色　者為多，腳脛亦有　，體重亦大，體實頗強健，產卵亦多，一年能達一百五十個以上。</p>
<p>（三）通屬雞　卽南通州及如皋，泰興二縣所產之雞，體形四方而稍長，毛色以黑色者為多，較浦東雞為緊密，脛色不一，而略有腳毛，體重稍小，肉味尚佳，產卵年至百個以上，雞雛極易飼育。</p>
<p>（四）淮屬雞　　卽舊淮安府屬之　江，淮城等縣所產之雞，體重比浦東，崇明雞為小，青脛鳥喙，頗不受人歡迎，毛色也並不一律。此雞抵埠後死亡最多，蓋亦遠道奔波辛苦所致吧？</p>
<p>（五）烏骨雞　俗名羊毛雞，自松江及江北各口岸輸入，但飼養者不多，故人行者亦甚少。羽毛色純白而微卷，嘴與腳脛皆黑色，甚矮小，護雛信念極強，肉質亦佳，廣東福建人最愛食之。此雞一般作玩賞用，故價格甚貴，多由鴿子野味行出售。</p>
<p>（六）口岸鴨　鴨有口岸鴨，揚屬鴨及長江鸭之別。凡産於舊通屬通州如皋等地者曰「口岸」；産於舊揚屬高，寶，興，泰，東，江都各縣者曰「揚屬」；産於長江沿岸蕪湖，南京者曰「長江」。三種體形甚仿佛，非老於此道者不能分別。口岸鴨其體不甚大而易肥，黃腳鳥喙，毛色斑駁，尾高舉，腳脛居體之後方，一見卽知其為善於產卵之品種。高郵鴨（揚屬）所產之卵有雙黃者，頗受人歡迎，此種鴨極易飼育，故高郵鴨蛋極負盛名。</p>
<p>（七）鵝　江北一帶俱產，惟由舊揚屬各縣所產者為較多，毛白嘴黃，腳脛亦黃色，冠高大，體重有至二十斤以上者，雄者鳴聲宏亮，早熟易肥，肉質亦佳，惟鵝雛不易飼育。廣東人最喜食鵝，回回人則把鵝油代豬油牛油之用。</p>
<p>本市日用雞鴨之來源，除上述諸地外，丹陽，溧陽等地產鴨亦多，輸入本市亦不少。至於雞鴨行，則分南北二市，南市指董家渡而言，北市指十六鋪而言；非指滬南與閘北也。在南市之大雞鴨行有五家；雞行三，沈大昌，沈昌，義盛源；鴨行二，新長順，南德豐；地點俱在浦濱董家渡一帶。在北市者有八家：德豐，萬豐，普益，合美，協記，地點均在外馬路；太和豐，鴻大，裕泰，均在老太平弄內。此外外馬路，尚有恒大行，公記行，恒泰行三家，但係專營鴨子野味，如野鴨，水老鴨，鷺鶿等。其餘如老太平街之陳永豐，德豐。增祥街之兪龍記，集永街之趙明記，會館街之陳同興等雞鴨鋪，均非行家，乃係由行家買賣轉售與販戶，故未入公所。各行設備俱係在店面前置雞鴨籠。所用之秤均由公所頒發。來客均由行家供給膳宿，故須備臥具，但雞鴨臨時飼料則歸販客自理。說到販運狀況，多係船運至十六鋪上岸，任客自由投行，指定後，由行夥將雞鴨搬運到行，不得在途兜攬。至於販戶，則由小車裝籠，分運至閘北，虹口及虬江路，密勒路等處。南市在薛家浜，裏馬路一帶；公共租界在鐵房子，小菜塲；法租界則在菜市路等處。雞鴨行同業有上海聚源堂雞鴨業公所之組織，其地址在老太平街，該公所於民國甲子年定有公議行規二十條，又有同行整頓出售雞鴨鵝規則，其為認真。至其納稅情形，則在清光緒末年才開始認稅，計總數為銀一千三百元；至民十四年，陸續加至四千九百二十元；至民十五年後，增至八千元。入雞鴨公所者，資本至少三萬元，蓋資本太少，恐有倒閉之虞，致連累公所也。民八以後開設者須納公所基金五百元，因行家倒閉後，公所須負維持善後之責。</p>
<p>民國十八年，雞鴨行同業喬仲仙等呈請社會局准予設立同業公會，其會員計有普益，合美等十九家，惟轉運販賣雞鴨者則無慮百數十家。而雞鴨之卵，尤為日常必需食品。計本市之蛋行有茂昌，陸伯記，錫記，協和，朱愼昌，徐鑫記等五十餘家，亦有同業公會之組織，與雞鴨行聯絡亦極密切，蓋「雞不離蛋，蛋不離雞」故也。</p>
<p>改良雞種的新式養雞塲中，對於蛋的改良固然不遺餘力，但因為售價稍昂，究竟不能普及，所以還是要算各蛋行的營業來得鼎盛些。至於本市蛋產品加工業製造乾蛋白，蛋黃粉等之廠家，共有三十餘處，加入同業公會者亦有二十家。因為這些製蛋廠對於日常所需的蛋糕，餅乾，蛋捲等點心食品的原料是要負責供給的。牠的廠名則有乾元，華興，豐裕，和興，華昌，鼎記，慶成，宏昶，宏新，慶豐，鼎盛，同新，宏裕昌，元生，宏盛，漢興祥，鼎豐，增新，新昶，松源等二十餘家。</p>

<p>「沒有，箱子裏一個錢都沒有！」我很堅決的回答着，心中很卑視他們。</p>
<p>「眞的沒有？」</p>
<p>「眞的沒有！」我有些發氣了。</p>
<p>「打開來，看一看！」</p>
<p>我漲紅了臉，打開了箱子。老相做着不耐煩的臉相。</p>
<p>警察過來，很隨便地翻了一翻，就對躱開了。</p>
<p>警官盤問着我們：從什麽地方來，以及來「新京」底目的。他非常輕鬆地問着，不像以前那樣的嚴厲了。</p>
<p>我們都放下了心，回答他說：從奉天來，想投靠「新京」底「大同學院」。</p>
<p>他們都慢慢地退了出去。</p>
<p>「天！他們為什麽要同我們開玩笑呵！」老相高興得發狂了。</p>
<p>「沉着點！外面……」我阻止着老相。</p>
<p>帳房先生走過來，我問他：</p>
<p>「有什麽事麼？為啥查店呢？」</p>
<p>「您不知道，今晚八點鐘，三馬路出了搶案啦。」他那雙小圓眼睛，說完了緊緊地轉着，很怱忙地走開了。</p>
<p>我進來告訴給他們這個消息，大家都相對的一笑。</p>
<p>是的：聲色，賭博，烟酒，偷竊，強搶，霸道，這一切的一切，就是我們在「干道」政治中心停留三十多小時的工夫，所見所聞的。</p>
<p>夜十二時，我們又攢進了哈長路的老舊列車。</p>
<p>這堅實老舊的車廂，仍然沒有變更它底原形，我像似見了故人。</p>
<p>車上沒有燈，我們都在渾黑中，摸索着，摸索着。</p>
<p>我們勉強地擠到了幾個位子，兩傍坐着的，都是從山東來的飢民。</p>
<p>一個六七歲的孩子，疲乏極了無處睡，母親把他捺倒在車地板上。孩子顧不到泥土唾液，甜蜜地睡過去了。</p>
<p>一道銳利的光從左邊射了過去；光底後面，引着一個黃衣「警乘」，慢慢地走到了睡熟的孩子身旁。</p>
<p>「什麽睡覺的，不行！……」他惡狠狠地問這大夢沉沉的孩子，就是一皮鞋。</p>
<p>孩子沒有動，也沒有了呼吸。</p>
<p>他收回了電炬底光，往前走去。</p>
<p>母親底慘號和着滾滾的輪音震徹了車上每一個人底心坎。我們都輕輕地躱開了，不忍再聽這弱者底哀鳴了！</p>
<p>星兒淒涼地在天空貶着眼，像為這小靈魂在啼泣。</p>
<p>黑茫茫的大地，樹着無數的暗影；我們這弱者羣，都投到了牠這黝黑的懷抱裏。</p>
<p>渾濁的晨霧和車頭噴出來的煤烟絞在一起，　　一張　　　，罩着地面</p>
<p>東方，在這層濁霧底背後，映現出一個淡紅的圈。</p>
<p>菜販子，掮着挑子，寒冷使他在眼眶里轉着汪汪的淚水；他不耐煩地站在栅門外，等着過鐵道上底橫路。</p>
<p>「打牛房子」底後身圍着一羣野狗，在鑚尋丟出來的牛骨頭。</p>
<p>我集中了注意力，把腦袋伸在車窗外面，在找我十年前住過的房子。</p>
<p>老相磕睡醒了，推了我一下說：「到哪啦？都不呌我們一聲！」</p>
<p>「到上號啦！」</p>
<p>他們都驚醒轉來，爭着往窗外邊看。</p>
<p>呵！我歡喜得流出淚來了，我想跳出車窗，去吻那闊別十年的拉丁式小房子。</p>
<p>它那紅瓦的屋頂，鮮艷孤高地立在那里，上面鋪了一層露珠。圍着它的小籬笆，院門前的幾棵樹，房左垃圾堆　的白鐵罐頭皮子，都像我十年前住在這兒的時候一樣，一點都沒有變動似的。但是我底溫和的俄國女主人和她底天真可愛的小麗娜呢？在籬笆圍着的院心中，恍惚看見了晾着一些像似和式的衣裳，那大袖子被風吹着，飄來飄去地。</p>
<p>這又像親膩，又顯着生疎的一切，飛速地掠過了我底眼底。</p>
<p>車停住在最後的終點——哈爾濱秦家崗車站。</p>
<p>站台上熙攘的人羣雖仍然像十年前那樣的擁擠，可是這四年前的巴黎姑娘，像似出嫁了「×京」，情形究與以前有點不同了。車站內部底形式全部都變動了，所有的路引牌子的路名又統統換了某文，使我們看了，像似懂又像似不懂；東西亂撞了半天，才衝出了這混亂的吞吐口。</p>
<p>汽車載着我們五個，沿着車站衝往許公路跑去。</p>
<p>路傍，宮殿式的第三中學，像似沒落了的貴族公子，勉強地支持在那里；頂子上底紅綠色琉璃瓦，釉子都脫落了；四周圍着一層層的鐵棘籬，門前樹着兩支明晃晃的刺刀，牆上懸着一塊本色木牌子，上面　　幾個　字，　似「大××無綫電班」。</p>
<p>汽車喘息着，又把我們載過許公路口。傍邊在我沒有離開哈爾濱時就在動工建築的圖書館，現在已經完成了；不過這座樓房並沒有充作圖書館之用，而是改為「哈爾濱省會警察廳」。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e6">Japan Pays Attention to British, American, French, and Soviet Actions Towards China; Britain is Extremely Concerned About the Two Issues of Anti-Communism in North China; France Opposes a Sino-Japanese Military Alliance Against the Soviet Union <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Recent reports of various actions being taken by Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union toward China are causing the calm of the past few days to become sharp again here. According to a Shanghai dispatch from the Yomiuri Shimbun, the ambassadors of Britain, the United States, and France in China have repeatedly decided to meet with Ambassador Kawagoe since Double Ten Day to declare their respective countries' attitudes. In particular, the British and French ambassadors frankly told Ambassador Kawagoe that they had very serious concerns about the issue of a Sino-Japanese joint anti-communist front. It is said that British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen told Ambassador Kawagoe that in order to maintain Britain's vested interests in China, Britain is deeply concerned about the North China issue, which is now the focus of Sino-Japanese negotiations. At the same time, Britain cannot ignore the issue of joint anti-communism. Although Britain does not oppose this in principle, if Japan further demands the right to station troops and military aircraft in China and the right to freely fly over Chinese territory, then Britain cannot sit idly by and let it pass. From Britain's perspective, if Japan does so, the balance of military power in the Far East will be shaken. The newspaper also recorded the following statement by French Ambassador Naggiar after meeting with Ambassador Kawagoe: If Japan makes a demand for a joint anti-communist front that contains the nature of a military alliance against the Soviet Union, then the French government, based on the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty, will have to consider itself seriously affected, because the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty is not limited to Western Europe alone. The above-mentioned steps have clearly aroused the deepest concern here. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e40">Major Fires Occur in Guangzhou for Several Days, 17 Shops Destroyed on Baqi Road, Eastern Bund, 47 Businesses Burned Down in Henan <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: In Guangzhou City, in recent days, due to the dryness of late autumn and arid weather, and the occasional carelessness of citizens who do not guard against fire, disasters have been reported frequently. After the great fire at Xin Shengsha in Dongguan, which burned down hundreds of shops, two more major fires have occurred continuously in the southeast of the city in the last two days. Each incident has resulted in the destruction of dozens of shops, causing significant losses and constituting a great calamity for the citizens. The situation of the fires on the Eastern Bund and in Henan in recent days is summarized below:</p>
<p>Eastern Bund</p>
<p>Although the roads on the Eastern Bund of Guangzhou City have been widened recently, the shops are still densely packed. Among them, Qichang Store, No. 22 Baqi Main Road, has been engaged in the electric oil business, supplying automobiles coming and going. Usually, dozens of boxes of electric oil are stored in the store. At about 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 13th, a partner accidentally left embers, which ignited the wooden planks of the room. Immediately, flames burst forth. By the time they ran out to sound the whistle and call the police, the flames had already spread to the electric oil stored in the store. At this point, it became an uncontrollable fire. Although the fire brigade made every effort to extinguish it, in an instant, it spread to the nearby Baqi Second Road. Refugees in the fire field, supporting the old and carrying the young, risked escaping from the thick smoke. Five or six people fell and were injured along the way. Fortunately, the incident occurred during the daytime, making rescue relatively easier. However, the fire burned until 5:00 PM before it was extinguished. A total of 19 shops were burned down. Those burned down on Baqi Main Road include: Tongfuhao, the Regimental Headquarters of the 914th Regiment of the 152nd Division, Yadong Steel Factory, Qichang Electric Oil Store, Yongguang Electric Oil Store, Feilun Rickshaw Factory, Heli Electric Oil Store, Taixinglong Freight Yard, Faxing Coal Factory, and Faxing Warehouse. Those burned down on Baqi Second Road include: Xinhe Firewood Store, Shengchang Store, Sihe Store, Hongsheng Store, Xiangjihao, and Liuxingjihao, as well as one empty shop. A small boat near the bank was also destroyed by the fire.</p>
<p>Henan</p>
<p>The Buliu Bank of Henan in Guangzhou has a vast area and dense population. The Xishi Main Street is located there, with no roads yet closed, and shops face each other, only a short distance apart. At about 3:00 AM on the 14th, while the citizens were still fast asleep, they suddenly heard loud gongs and frequent police whistles. The residents awoke from their sweet dreams, and the sky was already ablaze with fire. The area around Xishi Street resembled a fire dragon. Soon after, fire engines and fire brigades rushed to the scene, sucking water and injecting it, but because the streets were narrow, they could not get close. Moreover, a strong north wind was blowing that night, adding to the fire's intensity and speed of spread. In an instant, fires broke out in all directions. Later, the fire brigade opened a firebreak from a distance to prevent it from spreading. After several attempts to extinguish the fire, the flames were extinguished until the sky was bright (around 7:00 AM). An investigation revealed that the fire was caused by the carelessness of the Guang Hengsheng Beijing Fruit and Seafood Store on Xishi Street. When the fire broke out, six or seven shop assistants fled in confusion, but the son of an old partner, about fifteen years old, who was sleeping upstairs, was not rescued by his companions and died in the fire pit. Later, his remains were unearthed, his head and face scorched, a very tragic death. A total of 47 shops were burned down. In addition to the Guang Hengsheng store where the fire started, they included: Lianchang Pork Store, empty shops No. 1 and 2, Fengfa Tobacco Store, Qili Store, Yongchang Store, Chunshengtang Herbal Medicine Store, Ruiyuan Sundries Store, Baosheng Herbal Medicine Store, Nanzhanhao, Yongyuan Store, Caiyuan Teahouse, Lisheng Tobacco Store, Chunji Beef Store, Dahua Barber Shop, Fushan Nunnery, Lianghe Soda Store, Minzhong School, Longji Paper Store, Sanxing Salted Fish Store, Faji Fresh Fish Store, Lianan Pork Store, Rongzhen Sundries Store, You Nan Bakery, Yonghe Pawnshop, all on Xishi Main Street. The burned-down residences on Jielong Xin Street include: Wang Residence, Zhou Residence, Guangyuan Stack, Kong Residence, Yongantang on Longdao Main Street, Tongde Tobacco Store, Rongxing Stationery Store, Tongsheng Paper Store, Xingji Cloth Store, Anji Cloth Store, Dexiang Teahouse, Desheng Silver Store, Deji Cloth Store, two empty shops. Longxingsheng Preserved Meat Store on Longdao Tongjin Street, Yuanchang Earthenware Store, Baoan Incense Store, Dajisheng Lantern Store. (October 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e41">Dunpan's Shadowy Words (Part 1): A Sideways Look at Sino-Japanese Diplomacy <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Tracing the history of China and Japan, two countries that are close as lips and teeth, officials have sought peace and mutual benefit. However, since the sudden outbreak of the September 18th Incident, although diplomatic relations between the two countries have remained for five years, a practical assessment shows that the conflict has spread from the three northeastern provinces to the entire province of Rehe. Localized resistance has lasted for months. The deeper the stimulation, the greater the impact, leading to the occurrence of other unfortunate incidents. Considering the root causes, it is possible to overstate the situation. Even from the perspective of negotiation, the Executive Yuan established the Beiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee three years ago, and the Military Affairs Commission also established a branch in Beiping. However, the situation became entangled, and the environment became increasingly pressing. The scope of exploration and discussion was limited to local events. The abolition of the Political Affairs Reorganization Committee last autumn seemed to herald an impending crisis. After several twists and turns, the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee was established. However, its limited powers and responsibilities were largely confined to local matters. As such, over the months and years, although diplomatic channels between China and Japan remained open and diplomatic organs continued to exchange visits, the mere mention of diplomatic issues evoked a sense of infinite difficulty, as if one were faced with a twenty-four-volume history, unsure of where to begin. Is this not exceedingly strange? The current adjustment of diplomatic relations between the two countries is circuitous and complex, and the future outcome is impossible for outsiders to predict. Even the negotiations of the past half month cannot be fully known due to the confidentiality period. However, this matter is of great importance to the future of the country and is something that the people eagerly want to know. Therefore, I have gathered information from the sidelines, verified old news, and offer it to the readers, knowing that I may be blamed.</p>
<p>The current Sino-Japanese negotiations can be broadly divided into stages A and B. Stage A encompasses the period from the Japanese proposal to the suspension of negotiations. Stage B covers the period after the suspension of negotiations, when President Chiang returned to Nanjing and Ambassador Kawagoe held talks, up to the present. Within these stages, there have also been side activities. Stage B is currently underway, and it is still too early to say whether it will proceed smoothly or encounter further complications. However, the people of the country should establish limits and uphold principles. Matters deemed worthy of discussion should not deviate from these principles; otherwise, we must politely decline. If our defenses are strong, the results will be positive, and this is something that the people should strive for together.</p>
<p>Let us first discuss the methods employed in stage A. Traditionally, diplomacy has involved both written and oral communication. As for adjusting diplomatic relations, oral communication is naturally the initial step for preliminary exploration. Once written words are involved, they leave traces, unlike spoken words, which allow for the mutual expression of problems, repeated questioning, and the exploration of the true nature and origins of issues. However, because oral discourse lacks definition, it is prone to contraction and expansion, and the risk of imprudent words and loss of composure is unavoidable. Moreover, there are significant differences in the importance and urgency of matters. If the oral communication does not come from a single source, it becomes even more inconsistent. The best way to respond is to strengthen one's own position and adopt a calm and firm attitude. Regardless of whether the other party is a single person or more, we can handle it calmly with a single person. We can report to the readers on the process of stage A. Both the proposals made by Japan and our responses were oral. However, the proposals made by Japan were not necessarily all voiced by a single person, while we responded with the strength of a single person.</p>
<p>As for the items in Japan's so-called diplomatic plan, it was initially said that there were seven, but they have not been made public, making it impossible to list them. Consulting the newspapers of both countries, as well as foreign news agencies such as Reuters, reveals varying accounts. However, the differences lie only in the addition or subtraction of items, while the main points remain the same. Now, let us discuss these main points separately and try to describe the perceptions from the standpoints of both countries. Since we belong to opposing sides, the adjustment of diplomatic relations will naturally be fraught with difficulties, and it is impossible to achieve results overnight.</p>
<p>Among the various items, the one most worthy of our attention is the so-called "clarification of North China." This is something that the Chinese and foreign press have been competing to report. North China and South China are merely geographical terms used casually. In reality, the provincial system is subordinate to the central government, leaving no room for any deviation. Three years ago, during the Changcheng War, the Executive Yuan established a committee in Beiping. This was a temporary measure by the government to strengthen the border defense, and it was never intended to suggest that the provinces of Hebei and Chahar required separate organizations. The establishment of a branch of the Military Affairs Commission to command military affairs was like setting up a command headquarters in each province during the suppression of the communists. There was no element of political separation involved. However, with these organizations in place, the political affairs of Hebei and Chahar, even local matters, were sometimes concentrated in the two committees. In fulfilling their duties, the two committees could not avoid limited external negotiations. As this accumulated over time, Japan came to believe that the political institutions of North China must be handled by North China itself. They even cited items from the temporary powers and responsibilities of that time, or even items that were only discussed but never implemented, claiming that since there were proposals at the time, they should be implemented urgently. They seem to be unaware that the so-called items were conceived by a small group of people and cannot be considered precedents. There is no precedent to speak of at all. Some Japanese may believe that matters negotiated above can be easily resolved at the local level, while it is difficult for the central government to make remote decisions. It is better for the central government to grant greater special powers to the local authorities, so that they can resolve matters directly, turn big issues into small ones, and come to a consensus, somewhat similar to the situation in the three northeastern provinces before 1928, where Zhang Zuolin's word was final. However, the environment is different, and the political situation has changed. Carving a mark on a boat to find a lost sword will not work. Even if it did, it would not necessarily turn big issues into small ones. Japan believes that Hebei, Chahar, and other provinces are adjacent to the northeastern provinces, and recently, economic and military activities have become increasingly frequent. They insist on the name of "clarification" to fully implement their plans. This is fundamentally different from our country's perspective. In our country, sovereignty resides in the central government, and no other country is allowed to interfere. The division of power is governed by the laws of the constitution. If the needs of the times or special circumstances require it, measures should be taken to strengthen the political institutions of the northern provinces within the principle of not losing sovereignty and adapting to the environment. How can we entrust this to the name of authorization and engage in the practice of cutting our feet to fit the shoes? This is something that the people of the country believe in and the government's policy is based on. Within Hebei Province, there is also the illegal organization of Eastern Hebei, which is even more at odds with our political system. Our side cannot remain silent on this matter.</p>
<p>The issue of anti-communism is widely discussed, as seen in the reports. It is considered a key point in the negotiations. The communist issue involves military actions and ideological issues. Our country's political system is fundamentally different from communism. As for communist military actions, the work of suppression in recent years has been visible to all. We have spared no effort. As for ideological issues, they belong to the realm of academic thought and should be dealt with separately, not lumped together with military affairs. However, Japan is now talking about joint anti-communism without a clear scope. This matter is purely an internal affair in which no other country should interfere. Therefore, if there is indeed an anti-communism item in the diplomatic adjustment plan, we hope that those who speak on it will adopt a cautious attitude, lest it cause further irritation and make people suspect that the professed anti-communism is a disguise for interfering in our internal politics.</p>
<p>The tariff issue is also a major aspect of this matter. Our country has been constrained by treaty tariffs for many years. After several negotiations, we have finally managed to free ourselves from the shackles and seek autonomy. However, compared to the barriers erected by other countries, we still feel weak. Since last winter, the Japanese have been engaged in smuggling on a large scale, shipping goods to Hebei Province from Korea without regard for distance, openly transporting goods and resisting with force. On the one hand, they are skillfully creating the name of special trade; on the other hand, they are claiming that reducing taxes will prosper the market, in order to clear out the backlog of their industrial products. Japan relies on industry to build the nation, but it also lacks raw materials. The key to its success lies in the low cost of its manufacturing and its sales in the world market. If it relies on its scientific skills and low labor costs to sell its goods in the world market through competition, this is the right way of trade. However, to force others to reduce taxes to increase their sales, to use smuggling as a means of coercing tax reductions, and to further break our principle of autonomous tariffs, forcing us to return to the shackles that we have already escaped, this is not a reasonable matter. The principle of autonomy has been fought for through hardships, and no one is willing to return to the shackles to weaken their national power. Therefore, it is right for us to reject this and at the same time contain smuggling as a countermeasure.</p>

<h3 id="e43">National Economic Construction Movement and Promoting Agricultural and Forestry Production Construction <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Zeng Jikuan</p>
<p>At present, China's rural economy is bankrupt, the people's lives are difficult, and the future of the nation is precarious. The only urgent problem is how to increase production and revive the countryside, so that the people can rest and recuperate, and work together in the national economic construction movement, moving towards the general goal of "exhausting human power, developing land resources, balancing supply and demand, and facilitating circulation to seek the healthy development of the national economy," in order to achieve the goal of national rejuvenation.  Therefore, in view of the future trend of economic construction in Jiangsu Province, we will focus on the application of scientific and technological methods to promote the construction of various agricultural and forestry productions. Since this is inextricably linked to the national economic construction movement, I will briefly state my humble opinions on the key points of their interdependence for exploration.</p>
<p>In simple terms, the National Economic Construction Movement is a poverty alleviation movement, which is also a national salvation or national rejuvenation movement.  Sun Yat-sen said: "The most important thing in construction is the people's livelihood. People's livelihood is the life of the people, the survival of the country, the livelihood of the society, and the life of the masses." It is also the lifeblood of the national economy. The development of the national economy will lead to the prosperity of the people's livelihood; the suffering of the people's livelihood will lead to the decline of the national economy.  It can be seen that the significance of the national economic construction movement lies in arousing the national consciousness and uniting the strength of the entire nation to fight for national salvation. This is different from the struggle for survival of ordinary people.  This is to cultivate people's strength in a planned and organized manner, to use people's strength to engage in various production and construction movements, so as to promote the healthy development of the national economy. It is not like the economic activities of individuals, which are merely unconscious, selfish, and self-interested production behaviors.</p>
<p>Now that we deeply understand the true meaning of the National Economic Construction Movement, we should further discuss the methods and steps for implementing the National Economic Construction Movement. Although the methods are nothing more than utilizing the cooperative system, the education system, the military organization, the cooperation of academic institutions and academic groups, or the automation of industrial groups and production organizations themselves, the most important thing in the implementation steps is to actively engage in agricultural and forestry production and construction movements.  The reason is that the foundation of our country's national economy is in the countryside. The decline in agricultural and forestry production will lead to the decline of the rural economy, and the national economy will also decline. Therefore, our country's human and financial resources are showing a scattered and disorganized phenomenon. Therefore, if we want to promote the prosperity of the rural economy, we must actively improve agricultural and forestry production. However, if we want to increase national wealth, improve the people's lives, and seek the healthy development of the national economy, we must first seek the self-sufficiency of our country's agricultural and forestry products.  Due to the impact of international imperialism's economic aggression, our country's production cannot be self-sufficient. If we want to achieve the goal of universal improvement of agricultural and forestry production and preserve the lifeblood of our country's national economy, the whole country must work together from top to bottom to carry out the rural revitalization movement. In other words, without the national strength of the entire country engaged in the national economic construction movement, it is not enough to solve the problem of increasing production and reviving the countryside.</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the backwardness of our country's production, the forces of international capitalism have invaded our country's agriculture, and farmers have suffered from economic oppression, which has been enough to destroy the vitality of Chinese agriculture. Tracing its origins, it is due to the fact that our country's agricultural and forestry production and construction are too immature and lack a sound organization. There is a regret that people have not done their best and the land has not been fully utilized. If we want to remedy its shortcomings and promote agricultural and forestry production and construction, its organization and steps must be unified. However, this requires the joint efforts of the people, which is even more urgent. Therefore, all agricultural and forestry production and construction projects must be carried out through the entire national economic construction movement in order to exert their grand effects and lay the initial foundation for the rejuvenation of the nation.</p>
<p>Taking the promotion of reclamation and cultivation as an example, the development of reclamation and cultivation must rely on the promotion of agricultural cooperation. The use of cooperative organizations can collectivize farmland, mechanize tools, and combine purchasing and sales. The collectivization of farmland can avoid the drawbacks of overlapping ridges, small areas, and irregular terrain, and implement land consolidation suitable for the scale of operation. It can also use agricultural machinery to improve planting and achieve the purpose of increasing production. The joint purchase and sale can enable farmers to obtain cheap seeds and fertilizers, reduce production costs, and sell products at high prices, avoiding the exploitation and unnecessary consumption of merchants in the middle.  However, agricultural cooperative undertakings are helpful to the progress of reclamation undertakings, and the joint efforts of the people are indispensable.  The coastal reclamation area of northern Jiangsu Province is vast, with more than six million mu of arable but uncultivated grassland. If we want to develop it in the future to enrich people's lives, the first step is to use agricultural cooperation to concentrate the people near the reclamation area on a common goal, that is, the national economic construction movement.  Reclamation is a long-term plan and must be done by combining the efforts of the group to succeed. As for the promotion of cooperative undertakings, various social figures must use each other. Only when the insightful and perceptive people who have conducted in-depth research on cooperative undertakings advocate it, and the later-knowing and later-perceptive people lack effective publicity, can the implementation power of the ignorant and unaware masses be concentrated, and the optimistic success of the undertakings be expected. If we devote ourselves to the National Economic Construction Movement, then what the insightful and perceptive people advocate and invent will be promoted by the efforts of the later-knowing and later-perceptive people, and the ignorant and unaware people will do their best to complete it happily. Not only can cooperative undertakings be promoted smoothly, but also all reclamation work can be carried out by combining the efforts of the group.</p>
<p>The construction of agricultural irrigation works must also have a common organization of the people to be promoted effectively. Irrigation works are the key to transportation and irrigation, and disaster prevention. If the harbors are silted up and the drainage is not smooth, floods will inevitably occur in the event of heavy rain, and agricultural production will not be successful. Last year, the flood disaster affected the north and the south. Jiangsu Province was spared from the flood disaster, which was not the obvious effect of the government and the people working together on water conservancy construction. It can be seen that agricultural irrigation works require the sincere cooperation of the people and wealth to fundamentally prevent and control disasters and increase production effects. If so, then it is necessary to arouse the people to have a common understanding of the National Economic Construction Movement in order to increase their interest in engaging in production and construction.</p>
<p>Forestry directly affects the supply of industrial raw materials, and indirectly relates to the prevention and control of water and drought disasters, occupying the most important position in the National Economic Construction. However, its effect is slow to appear and lasts for a long time. Moreover, large-scale afforestation throughout the country is not enough to exert direct and indirect effects. In addition, newly planted young forests and naturally grown trees are scattered in mountains and fields everywhere, making management difficult. It is difficult to improve the knowledge of forestry cooperation among the local people and to improve their awareness of forest protection. If we want the people of the whole country to work hard on afforestation and actively protect forests, it is difficult to achieve effective results by relying only on the frequent promulgation of government decrees and the supervision of officials. It is only by regulating the closely related people's strength and wealth under the National Economic Construction Movement that it can be called upon to promote the development of forestry.</p>
<p>The prevention and control of diseases and insect pests of agricultural and forestry crops also requires the common consensus of all regions. Diseases and insect pests of crops and forests spread very quickly, especially insect pests. It is difficult to achieve effective results by implementing prevention and control methods only in one region or one place. We must contact all relevant parties to mobilize the whole body and eliminate them at the same time to have the possibility of fundamental elimination. The rural people in various places lack knowledge of disease and pest control. When diseases and insect pests occur in the vicinity, they are indifferent and watch from the sidelines. In order to reduce the diseases and insect pests of agricultural and forestry crops in various places and seek to increase production, we must first arouse the people in various places to carry out the movement of disease and pest control. If we want to achieve this goal, we must first devote ourselves to the National Economic Construction Movement to promote their common relationship.</p>
<p>To carry out agricultural extension, we must penetrate into the countryside and improve agricultural and forestry production. In particular, the producers must be willing to accept guidance in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. The agricultural and forestry institutions established by the government employ specialized talents. After years of trial and research, there are excellent seeds and planting methods that can be promoted. However, if we want the farmers who produce to be willing to accept them, and these good seeds and methods can be promoted universally, we cannot rely solely on the power of administration. We must use cooperative farming methods to implement large-scale promotion campaigns. To implement large-scale promotion campaigns, we must concentrate on the common goal of the National Economic Construction Movement and devote all our efforts to penetrating into the countryside in order to achieve the goal of improving agriculture and increasing production.</p>
<p>In summary, the human and material resources that rely on the promotion of the above points must have an appropriately used organization. In particular, industrial groups and production institutions must cooperate to take the agricultural and forestry production and construction movement as the vanguard and the National Economic Construction Movement as the general driving force, unite all sectors of the community, the entire people, pool their wisdom and efforts, divide the work and cooperate, and work hard towards the same general goal. Then, we can reach the final stage of national economic construction, and the foundation of national rejuvenation will be further consolidated.</p>

<h3 id="e44">The Background and Impact of Belgium's Declaration of Neutrality <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The King of Belgium convened a plenary meeting of the cabinet the other day. He declared that Belgium would restore its pre-war policy of neutrality. The significance of this declaration is equivalent to Belgium's statement that it abandons its responsibilities under the Locarno Treaty and the Franco-Belgian military agreement of 1920. At a time when several fascist ambitious countries in Europe are running rampant and continuously striking at the collective security system, Belgium's change of policy will obviously have serious implications. The French government has now raised questions. Although the British authorities are keeping silent, the public clearly expresses no small amount of shock. Even the entire diplomatic community in Europe will have to readjust its policies because of this sudden change. We should understand the background and possible impact of this important change in international relations.</p>
<p>There are two aspects to the King of Belgium's announcement of the restoration of the pre-war Chinese policy this time. One is domestic and the other is international. Domestically, we can see the reasons for this change from the foreign policies of the two main ethnic groups in Belgium. Originally, the Belgian people mainly belong to two ethnic groups. The Walloons are mostly near France, and the Flemings are mostly near the Netherlands. The Walloons speak French and the Flemings speak Dutch. They have a big difference in their policy towards France. The Walloons advocate being pro-French, while the Flemings oppose being pro-French and advocate the same as the Netherlands, with British power as a security guarantee. After the European War, in view of the past war's disaster, the country proposed to Britain to conclude a military alliance, but it was unsuccessful due to various reasons. In 1920, Belgium concluded a military alliance with France. This alliance was regarded as a great victory for the Walloons, but the Flemings always insisted on opposing it. However, in the past ten years after the war, France seemed to become the leader of the European continent, and its alliance with Belgium did not shake in the slightest because of the Flemings' opposition. But in the past two years, there have been changes in two situations that have gradually given the anti-French faction an advantage. One is that Hitler has continuously broken the Treaty of Versailles, torn up the Locarno Treaty, and expanded the navy, army and air force. France has not adopted a strong policy to deal with it. This indicates that France's hegemony on the mainland has been declining, and some pro-French Belgians have also begun to waver. The other is that after the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty was established, the conservative reactionaries in Belgium had doubts about France. Suspecting that the Flemings' anti-French policy suddenly increased many supporters. Since the establishment of the Dutch cabinet after the election in May of this year, the so-called "completely independent" foreign policy has already revealed the signs of alienating France. It was expected in the international community that the King of Belgium would announce a change of policy now.</p>
<p>Regarding the international background, both Britain and Germany are not without relationships. Britain's jealousy of France's hegemony on the mainland has not changed in the past ten years after the war. His alliance with Germany and Italy to contain France changed once when Italy invaded Abyssinia, but it was very temporary. When the Italo-Ethiopian War ended, Britain's tolerance of Germany's aggressive policy was as obvious as before. Therefore, for the future Locarno Five-Power Conference, Britain has tried its best to make France yield to Germany. And this time, Belgium's restoration of the pre-war policy of neutrality may have been influenced by Britain. According to foreign news reports, keen observers believe that the King's declaration this time was agreed with the British government in advance. This has been denied by powerful parties in London. However, the reaction of the British Conservative Party newspapers to this incident shows "sympathetic" understanding, and clues can be found. The Belgian people will never have a good impression of Germany. But since May of this year, a Rexist Party has newly appeared in Belgium, led by a young lawyer, Degrelle. His tendency is similar to that of the German National Socialist Party. This certainly cannot be proven to mean that the Rexist Party has relations with Germany. But the German National Socialist Party's attempt to invade Belgium has been very fierce in recent years. As long as Belgium remains conservatively neutral, it will be beneficial to Germany's aggressive policies.</p>
<p>The most urgent impact of this change in Belgium's foreign policy is the weakening of the defense of the northern border of France, which strengthens Germany's threat to France. Therefore, it is natural that Berlin expressed satisfaction with the King's announcement. As for the long-term impact, the European collective security system has suffered a serious blow. Even if Belgium does not take further steps to withdraw from the League of Nations, it has at least retreated to a passive position of inaction on the current world's "indivisible" peace movement. The crisis of European war in the future will therefore be even closer.</p>

<p>Navalcarnero, the Spanish government forces were defeated by the rebels' fierce artillery fire today, and are now retreating. Once this city falls, the outer line of Madrid's defense will collapse. (16th National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Daravanra, a special dispatch from our reporter: The troops commanded by General Varela of the National Army launched an attack on the city of Madrid this afternoon and immediately occupied the town of Valmoyeada, which is in front of the city of Navalcarnero. Once the city of Navalcarnero is captured, they can directly attack the capital. In today's battle, the National Army advanced six kilometers first and did not encounter strong resistance. Later, it was swept by government troops with machine guns in Qian Qian, and then stabbed with bayonets, and finally defeated the government troops. The government troops also abandoned many corpses, it is said. (16th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Madrid, the government troops are now retreating along the 35-mile line. The rebels surrounding the capital can advance very quickly. Navalcarnero, the last fortress outside Madrid, is in danger of falling at any time. The rebel column led by General Varela is now only five miles away from the town. Although the defensive works there are solid, they are afraid that it will be difficult to resist the rebels who are full of combat experience and commanded by good generals to repeatedly attack. If the rebels capture the town, it will be the first major victory in the western invasion of Madrid, and then they can attack the capital from the northwest. General Varela personally supervised the battle today and captured Valmojacada, the last village before the town of Navalcarnero. The rebels started from Santa Cruz Tritaema near the dawn, with the columns commanded by Colonel Yacob and General Asensio on both wings as escorts. The rebels did not encounter any resistance at first, but when they advanced to four miles from the village, the government troops bombarded fiercely with guns and cannons, and bullets rained down. General Varela's elite troops charged with bayonets, and before they reached the trenches guarded by the government troops, the government troops had fled, abandoning two field guns and many machine guns. The rebels then entered the village from the north and south sides and advanced ten miles towards the capital. The rebels are also engaged in a roundabout attack further north on the town of Escorial, 30 miles from the capital, which is connected by a well-built highway. Once the town falls, the rebels can attack the rear of the government troops' northern defense line. It is now heard that the capital is actively preparing for the defense of the city, digging trenches at various key points, and solid houses are being converted into small blockhouses.

<p>Jerusalem, the "truce" announced by the British military authorities after the end of the Arab general strike ended today. No disturbances occurred after the resumption of work throughout the territory. It is expected that the authorities will continue to cancel the defense plan, but the military plan has not yet been announced. Palestine has recently returned to an atmosphere of peace. There are many pedestrians on the roads, which has caused traffic problems. The workers in the city are all working hard to make up for the lost time after the strike. The sound of carpenters' hammers can be heard everywhere. The farmers in the countryside are all engaged in picking olives and grapes, or engaged in other harvests. According to the above-mentioned peaceful situation, there is currently no need for a large army to be stationed here. Military vehicles are full of soldiers going to the sports field, or swimming, or playing football, and no longer patrol the streets. The soldiers and the Arab people are very friendly. It is heard that the Sussex Army's major exercise, which was suspended before due to the dispatch of an expeditionary force to Palestine, is now being discussed by the Army General Staff to be held here.

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of establishing two committees to determine the border and to deal with the border disputes between the Soviet Union and Manchuria, Japan has consulted with "Manchukuo" and submitted a counter-proposal to the Soviet government. Ambassador Yurenev visited Foreign Minister Arita in the afternoon of the 16th, according to the instructions of his home government, and also submitted the Soviet counter-proposal in official documents. On that day, Ambassador Yurenev first reiterated his long-standing claim, that is, (1) Although the mixed committee for handling border disputes agrees to first set up the Japanese-Manchurian case in the eastern border (from Xingkai Lake to Tumen River), the mixed committee for determining the border must initially aim at determining the entire border between the Soviet Union and Manchuria. (2) Before the two mixed committees for determining the border are set up, in order to ensure the peace of the border, it is necessary to take appropriate measures. At the same time, the Soviet counter-proposal was submitted to the Soviet side in official documents (Russian), explaining its contents item by item. Before the entire explanation was completed, the bell rang six times, and he took his leave. It was decided to meet again next week. The Soviet side will submit a proposal explaining the contents in English and continue to discuss it. After the Soviet side completes its explanation at the meeting next week, the Japanese Director-General of the European and Asian Affairs Bureau, Togo, and the Soviet Counselor, Levedev, will open a special committee to continue the discussion based on the Japanese-Manchurian and Soviet cases.

<p>(New York) With the presidential election drawing near, the activities of the presidential candidates from various parties are becoming increasingly active. President Roosevelt has completed his 5,000-mile trip from Denver to Detroit and returned to New York. Republican presidential candidate Landon, after returning to Kansas, made a surprising move, suddenly telling reporters that he had decided to extend his influence to California and hoped to gain the state's support. Smith, the former Democratic presidential candidate who recently broke away from the Democratic Party, plans to meet with Landon at the end of the month in New York to discuss the wording of the final major campaign speech. Socialist presidential candidate Thomas predicts that President Roosevelt will be re-elected, saying, "It is not my personal wish that he be elected, but the people will all vote for Roosevelt." (16th Reuters)</p>
<p>Creeven - President Roosevelt spoke to 40,000 listeners from the rear platform of a special train today, vigorously criticizing the anti-government propaganda of New York banking circles, saying that a kind of propaganda is now being spread from the New York financial center to stockbrokers across the country against his re-election. The expenses for this propaganda are all provided by these stockbrokers, but by the third of next month, ordinary merchants and investors will be able to show that they have not been fooled. (16th National News)</p>
<p>Wilmington - Today, Senator Cuffee, chairman of the Democratic Senate Committee, announced in New York that Republican presidential candidate Landon's campaign expenses had received a large donation from the famous DuPont family, totaling $583,000. Cuffee also said that he had predicted that the DuPont family would donate up to $750,000 to the Republican Party during the election. After investigation, he felt that this statement was even more credible. The two DuPont brothers are very wealthy Americans. In the 1932 presidential election, the brothers were political enemies, with the elder brother supporting Hoover and the younger brother supporting Roosevelt. (16th Reuters)</p>
<p>Topeka - Republican presidential candidate Landon announced here today, during the heated presidential election competition, that he would rush to Los Angeles on the 20th of this month to give a speech, so that California would vote to support the Republican Party.

<p>Philadelphia - After President Roosevelt delivered a campaign speech the other day, accusing the Republican Party of being responsible for the economic panic, former President Hoover gave a speech here in response, briefly stating that the economic panic was the result of the European War and no one could be held responsible. As for the economic recovery, whether in the United States or around the world, signs had appeared nine months before President Roosevelt was elected, and it was not due to the current government. The budget figures presented by President Roosevelt are huge and the payments are excessive. "If the accounting books of private enterprises were similar to the current government's budget, those in charge would certainly have been imprisoned." (16th Havas)</p>

<p>Brussels - Political figures point out that the word "neutral" does not apply to Belgium, as Belgium will still abide by the League of Nations covenant and retain the right to judge where the threat comes from and what kind of military precautions should be taken. In addition, the technical agreement signed by the French and Belgian general staffs should be maintained, and the constraints of the Locarno Treaty should also be respected. This is different from a neutral policy. As for how Belgium should realize the constraints it has adopted on the League of Nations, especially the collective mutual assistance system stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations covenant, it is currently being studied. This issue will be explored when various countries negotiate the Western European Security Pact and when Belgium exchanges views with the relevant countries. However, Belgium's foreign policy still refuses to conclude military alliances and mutual assistance treaties, which is largely the same as a neutral status, but with minor differences.

According to official sources, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not prepared to send a note to the Belgian government, but will conduct talks between the French and Belgian governments. In addition to being held in Paris, these talks should also be held in the Belgian capital by the French Ambassador to Belgium, Laroche. (16th Havas)</p>
<p>(London) After meeting with Foreign Secretary Eden this morning, the French Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Corbin, met with Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Vansittart, in the evening to discuss the Belgian neutrality issue and Germany's reply to the convening of the Locarno Five-Power Conference. After talking with British foreign officials, Corbin took a train to Paris tonight to report everything to the cabinet. In addition, the German Chargé d'Affaires in the United Kingdom, Bismarck, also paid a visit to Vansittart in the afternoon. Britain had previously suggested convening a Locarno Five-Power Conference, and the German government had replied to the British government on the 13th of this month. What Vansittart and Bismarck discussed today was whether Germany's note should be published to the outside world. According to political figures, the content of the German reply seems "not optimistic," as it does not explain Germany's true attitude towards the Locarno Conference, but only raises some questions, which instead complicate the issue of convening the Locarno Conference.

<p>(London) Regarding the issue of the declaration made by King Leopold III of Belgium, the country's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Baron Moncheur, visited Foreign Secretary Eden yesterday to explain the country's position. According to sources in diplomatic circles, Moncheur plans to visit the Ministry of Foreign Affairs again to provide a clear explanation because yesterday's talks were not comprehensive enough. In addition, the Belgian ambassador stated that the agreement previously reached by Britain, France, and Belgium on March 19 this year, after Germany announced the abolition of the Locarno Treaty, is still valid at this time. In addition, the Belgian Ambassador to France, Kerchove, is also continuing to contact the French government to exchange views on the interpretation of the King's declaration and its consequences.

According to Italian official hints, after Ciano arrives in Berlin, he will suggest to Hitler that Germany make considerable friendly gestures to France, in order to lead to German-French understanding and ease the tense situation in Europe, and then gradually solve general problems.

<p>(Paris) The entire city of Paris was in darkness for one hour tonight. This was the first air defense drill after the European War. First, sirens sounded in the four cities, and powerful searchlight beams swept back and forth in the sky. All vehicles in the city stopped immediately, and military and civilian groups worked hard together to resist enemy aircraft attacks. Anti-aircraft guns fired loudly everywhere, and fire brigades rushed to put out the simulated fires. Rescue teams rushed to rescue the simulated bombing sites, and anti-gas teams rushed to the sites where enemy aircraft released poison gas to provide relief. Several fighter planes in the air intercepted the enemy aircraft. (16th National News)</p>
<p>(Paris) Here last night there was a slight fog, and sparse starlight peeked out from the clouds, swaying uncertainly. The passive air defense drill was carried out on time in the twilight according to the planned schedule. This was still the first time since the European War. At 9:20 p.m., the sirens of more than 70 factories sounded, warning the entire city to turn off the lights. At the same time, all vehicles on the street also stopped. At 9:43 p.m., several large bombers circled over the Pantheon and dropped huge flames as a symbol of bombs. One bomb fell at the foot of Rousseau's statue. Nurses throughout the city put on special clothing and put on gas masks and immediately set out to rescue. Firefighters also carried various washing and disinfecting materials and rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm. Subsequently, two bombs also fell near the statue of the 17th-century playwright Corneille and the Odéon Theater. The anti-aircraft artillery team immediately fired back, and fires broke out everywhere (imaginary), and firefighters rushed to put them out, which was very tense. Soon the fire was extinguished. At 12:30 midnight, the enemy aircraft escaped, and the entire city was lifted from martial law. All streets immediately returned to normal. According to the police chief Langeron, the situation in each district was very good. However, at the beginning of the exercise, more than 40 people lit flames, intending to take the opportunity to demonstrate. They were dispersed by the police and 11 people were arrested. Some anarchists distributed rebellious leaflets and were also arrested by the police. As for those who were charged with violating the law for not turning off the lights immediately, there were 458 cases. (17th Havas)</p>

Some anarchists even lit fires at street corners to play pranks, so this drill was declared a failure. (17th National News)</p>

<h3 id="e63">Japanese Cotton Market Exports Worse This Year Than Last Year <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The situation of Japan's cotton cloth exports is not as satisfactory as expected this spring. Both the quantity and value have shown a downward trend. What is particularly noteworthy is that the reduction in value is even greater than the quantity. In the first nine months of this year, the total output of Japanese cotton woven cloths was 1,989,640,000 square yards, worth a total of 348,526,000 yen. Compared with the same period last year, the quantity decreased by 80,822,000 square yards (3.9%), and the value decreased by 31,075,000 yen (8.2%). (17th Reuters)</p>

<h3 id="e64">Li and Wang Bandits Invade Southeast Sui; Bandit Troops Try Hard to Increase Military Strength; Certain Parties Provide Cotton and Military Uniforms <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Shangdu Correspondence, Wang Ying, the commander of the pseudo Northwest Anti-Communist Autonomous Army, since the Jiabu Conference returned, although the border of Sui was restrained, the atmosphere of instability and panic continued with several scares occurring each night. But looking at the situation, it seems that there is still a need for waiting. Small contacts are inevitable, and a formal westward advance will require a considerable period of time. Now the bandits such as Li Shoushin in Zhangbei and Wang Ying in Shangdu are actively increasing their strength and expanding their forces. It is heard that Li's troops have been expanded to five divisions, each division consisting of four regiments, all cavalry. The pseudo division commander of the First Division has been appointed as Liu Weiguang, the pseudo division commander of the Second Division is Yin Baoshan, the Third Division is Wang Xinmin, and the Fourth and Fifth Divisions are newly formed and are still being recruited, with few people. As for the color of the clothing of Li's bandit soldiers, they all wear khaki. Some parties recently transported a large number of khaki cotton military uniforms to Chahar, which may be to provide for the unit. Wang's bandits are based west of Shangdu, invading southeast Sui. Now their subordinates are stationed in Daqinggou, Nanhaoqian, and Sanbaogou. The strength is about 6,000, with more than half armed with firearms. After Wang returned from Dehua the other day, he did his best to reorganize his subordinates. Jin Jiasan, who served as a brigade commander under Feng Zhanhai, is now in Guyuan, summoning old subordinates, using the pseudo name "Xingya Army" to gather followers, and now has more than 500 people, who will be controlled by Wang Ying in the future. The uniforms of the cadres are gray military uniforms, which is a point of distinction from Li Shoushin's bandit unit. Li and Wang's troops have mistakenly committed a westward invasion, but their degree of preparation and the time of the westward invasion have not yet arrived. In the near future, there should be no formal firefight. According to people from Chahar, Chang Di is storing a large amount of gasoline and oil and transporting them to Shangdu, Duolun Dehua. Twenty armored vehicles have arrived in Dehua, and twenty planes from a certain party will fly in within days. Therefore, rumors are rife in Chahar and Southeast Sui. (13th)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Guizhou Province Moves Its Government: All Agencies in Nanning Relocated to Guilin; Guilin Headquarters of the Guizhou Army Established; Cai Tingkai's Troops to Be Consolidated into One Division <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Chen Cheng, the Chief of Staff of the Guangzhou Military Affairs Commission, recently went to Guizhou to discuss military affairs with Li Bai. After participating in the inspection of the Guizhou Army in Guilin, he immediately returned to Guangdong and then went north to report to Chairman Chiang. It is said that Chen's visit to Guizhou was to discuss the reorganization of the Guizhou Army, which will likely remain based on its original establishment but with a change of designations. As for the number of troops, it will remain at six divisions, or special units may be added. Once approved by the Central Government, an official announcement will be made. Troop demobilization has been underway for several days, and it is said that the Central Government has initially allocated 300,000 yuan for relocation expenses. The monthly military subsidy will be remitted to Guizhou starting this month. The incorporation of Cai Tingkai's army into the Fifth Route Army of Guizhou is currently in progress. The three division commanders, Weng Zhaoyuan, Qu Shounian, and Qiu Zhaochen, went to Nanning to meet Bai and discuss the method of incorporation. Bai therefore flew to Guilin on the 12th to discuss the matter in detail with Li Zongren. It is found that although Cai's army stationed in Guizhou has three division headquarters in Nanning—the 60th, 61st, and 78th divisions—the actual number of troops, when combined, is less than one division. Qu Shounian's unit has only seven companies, and Qiu and Weng's units together have no more than sixteen or seventeen companies. They are still stationed separately in Yulin, Bobai, and other places and have not moved. The three units will be consolidated into one division and incorporated into the Guizhou Army. The choice of division commander has not yet been determined. It may be selected from among Qu Shounian, Weng Zhaoyuan, Qiu Zhaochen, and Dai Ji. It is rumored that Qu and Dai have a higher chance, while Qiu and Weng may have other assignments. Guizhou Province moved its provincial capital to Guilin, and currently, all agencies in Nanning have been relocated in order. The first to move was the provincial government. Currently, all departments are working together in the same building. The Provincial Public Security Bureau has also moved to Guilin. The matters handled by the Nanning Public Security Bureau were transferred to the Yongning County Government on the 7th. The Special Party Headquarters of the Guizhou Army Headquarters also moved to Guilin on the 7th. It is estimated that starting from the 1st of this month, the military, political, and party agencies in Nanning have been relocated one after another. Documents and files were transported to Guilin by car, while bulky items were transported by more than a hundred civilian boats via the Fu River. Provincial government employees were given relocation subsidies due to the move. Appointed officials received a travel allowance of 100 yuan each, recommended officials received 80 yuan, and delegated officials were divided into three levels: 60 yuan, 40 yuan, and 20 yuan. After the relocation, Nanning suddenly had tens of thousands fewer agency employees residing there, and rents therefore fell sharply. Rents that were previously 50 yuan per month have now fallen to 20 yuan, due to the oversupply of housing. Speculative merchants are also preparing to move their shops to Guilin. Therefore, the current situation in Nanning has a feeling of the past. What remains is only the Nanning Military Academy. The original Guizhou Army Headquarters has been changed to an forward command post, with Xia Wei, the commander of the 15th Army of the Guizhou Army, as the director of the Nanning forward command post. The forward command post is organized into seven sections, with Huang Shaoping appointed as the director of the Transportation Section, Liu Fuqin as the director of the Ordnance Section, Wu Bingquan as the director of the Military Affairs Section, Mo Dongxi as the director of the Military Law Section, Li Bingzhong as the director of the Military Transportation Section, and Huang Yin as the director of the Military Medical Section. It began operations on the 11th of this month. After the provincial capital moved to Guilin, the security of southeastern Guizhou Province is entirely maintained by the militia. Due to the vast area of the southeast, in addition to strengthening the militia force, the Yulin area has been separated from the Xunzhou Militia Command Area to establish the Yulin Militia Command Area. Luo Zhen, the deputy commander of the Xunzhou area, was transferred to fill the position of commander of the Yulin Militia. The Yulin Command was established on Double Ten Day. (October 14)</p>
<h3 id="e66">A Japanese Ronin in Qingdao: Secretly Surveying and Mapping Inland Areas; Transporting a Large Quantity of Contraband by Train; Local Police and Stationmasters Unable to Intervene <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: In recent months, as the situation between China and Japan has become increasingly tense, certain foreign nationals in this city have become increasingly arrogant. Recently, a certain foreign national transported a large quantity of contraband goods and boarded a train at Qingdao Station. When the local police stepped forward to stop and inspect the goods, the foreign national not only refused to cooperate but also punched and kicked the police, acting in a very insulting manner. When the stationmaster on duty came forward to reason with him, the foreign national was very fierce and threatened to use force. The stationmaster, intimidated by his power, did not dare to argue further and ultimately allowed him to calmly load the goods onto the train and leave. This is but one example of his arrogance. Recently, a certain Japanese ronin residing in this city has been even more active, secretly going to various counties along the Jiaoji Railway, carrying instruments to survey and map the area, and conducting detailed investigations into the local customs, in order to make some kind of preparation. He also rents houses in major stations, engaging solely in the sale of drugs. Although the local authorities are well aware of this, they are unable to stop him. In the future, he will be a hidden danger to the area. (October 14)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Soaring Grain Prices in Bengbu: Scarce Supply Cannot Meet Demand; Wheat and Soybean Prices Rise Steadily <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: In northern Anhui, wheat and soybeans are the main agricultural products. This year, the counties have had a bumper harvest, with particularly large yields. The rural economy has improved, and farmers have had a chance to recover. The majority of these large quantities of agricultural products, aside from a small portion used for local consumption, are concentrated in Bengbu and then transported to Xihu, Tianjin, and other places. In addition, a significant amount of agricultural products from eastern Henan are also transported here for resale to other provinces. During the summer and autumn this year, the grain market in Bengbu was quite active. After the Jinpu Railway Bureau reduced freight rates for soybeans, sales of Anhui soybeans became even more brisk. In addition, imports of soybeans were scarce this autumn, causing soybean prices in Shanghai to gradually increase. Recently, the supply of soybeans has been relatively scarce, and there is a shortage of vehicles on the Jinpu Railway, making transportation difficult. Grain merchants are sitting idly by, unable to buy soybeans or find vehicles to transport them. Under the circumstances of supply not meeting demand, soybean prices have been soaring. Recently, the market price of large yellow soybeans from Yingzhou has risen from 14 yuan to 14.3 or 14.4 yuan per shi. Even medium-sized yellow soybeans have risen from 13.8 yuan to 14 yuan. Based on current observations, soybean prices are still expected to rise. The situation in the wheat market is similar, with scarce supply and prices not meeting demand. The Bengbu-based agents of flour mills in the north and south, as well as general grain merchants, have had no goods to buy in recent days. The only transactions are small amounts. There are few grain boats on the river, and the grain market is quiet. Grain stores have no business to do and are secretly complaining. The soaring wheat prices are particularly alarming. Feihe flower wheat has risen to 16.4 yuan per shi, Shouzhou red wheat to 15.8 yuan per shi, and Yingzhou white wheat to 15.6 yuan per shi, an increase of one yuan per shi compared to a few days ago. While soaring grain prices are sufficient to improve the rural economy, they are also having a significant impact on the livelihoods of city residents. (October 15)</p>

<p>In Zhangyan, Punan, a few days ago, a group of teenagers carrying the flag of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Relief Life Cooperative Society and claiming to be selling calligraphy brushes and ink sticks as part of a tour aroused suspicion. The Fourth Police Station of the town arrested four people: Jin Zhongming, Xiang Juchen, Lin Genmiao, and Xi Dafu. After interrogation, they were suspected of fraud and were handed over to the Jinshan County Public Security Bureau for strict interrogation. After a great deal of suspicion they were handed over on the 16th to the Third District Security Headquarters along with six other suspects including Li Zhicheng and Zheng Hongwen, and escorted by the county police for interrogation and investigation.</p>

<p>Wang Shujie, the district chief of Mudu District, Wuxian County, arbitrarily removed the wooden stakes surrounding the Mudu Taying Lane Station of the Su-Fu Long-Distance Bus Company, claiming that they violated the building regulations. The company claimed that the station was built before the building regulations were established and did not violate any regulations. Therefore, the directors Zhang Yipeng and Liu Fuqing filed a lawsuit with the court, accusing Wang Shujie of property damage and other crimes. The local court held a hearing on the 17th, presided over by Judge Zhou Chengjin. The plaintiff appeared in court with lawyer Xia Weisen, but the defendant did not appear. After the judge questioned the plaintiff, he ordered that the defendant be summoned for another hearing at a later date. In the meantime, Judge Zhou will personally go to Mudu for an on-site inspection to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>Due to the even rainfall this summer, the crops in various rural areas here, except for a portion of the cotton fields that were somewhat damaged, have all had bumper harvests. In order to determine the quality of the autumn harvest here, the Provincial Department of Finance specially sent Lu Lianjie to Changshu to conduct an inspection. After four or five days of inspecting various rural areas, he determined that the harvest was abundant. On the afternoon of the 16th, he convened a meeting with the directors of the Taxation Office and the East and West Grain Bureaus, the district chiefs, and the chiefs of the Second Sections to discuss the matter.

As for the seventh district, Dongke, it would be assessed at 91%. The overall average crop quality for cotton and rice was calculated to be 86.5%. The county magistrate and the provincial commission will now jointly submit a report to the Provincial Department for review and approval.</p>

<p>The internal structures of the Great World Amusement Park on Dongxin Road, outside the Guangfu Arch, were poorly constructed. On the afternoon of the 13th of this month, at 5:00 PM, the Parrot Hall in the western part of the park suddenly collapsed, injuring the female storyteller Huang Lifang and more than 20 spectators on the spot, who were sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is learned that after this incident occurred, the Construction Bureau immediately sent personnel to investigate. It was determined that the Phoenix Hall, Peacock Hall, Partridge Hall, and the Peking Opera section of the amusement park had small pillars and beams, were dangerously unsafe, and it was necessary to order them to be closed for repairs. However, the amusement park did not make any improvements and continued to operate as usual. Yesterday, the county magistrate, Long Tiyao, instructed Zhang Da, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, to immediately send police to order the amusement park to close in order to avoid further unfortunate incidents.</p>

<p>Qi Junqing, a resident of Tianjin, aged 24, residing at No. 7 Maoxin Lane, Yinglong Town, outside the West Gate, used to be a printing worker in Tianjin but is now unemployed. In July of this year, he brought his wife, Lu (aged 23), to Wuxi. Lu worked as a female worker in the Shenxin Yarn Factory, while Junqing was unemployed at home due to stomach pain. On the 16th, the couple suddenly had a quarrel for some unknown reason. Lu left in anger and did not return until 11:00 PM. Lu had recently separated from her husband due to his illness and lived with her cousin, Zhang Yuelan (also known as Yu Lan), next to the stove downstairs, while Junqing lived upstairs with his relatives Zhang Jin Yuan. Yesterday (the 17th), at 6:00 AM, Lu and Yu Lan got up, and Wang Lan went to work at the factory. Lu was in the kitchen cooking noodles. At around 7:00 AM, Zhang Jin Yuan and others got up and went to the kitchen to eat noodles. Suddenly, they saw Lu lying on the ground, covered in blood, with a fatal knife wound on her neck. There was a kitchen knife next to her. Zhang shouted loudly and tried to take the injured person to the hospital, but she had already died. Later, the neighbors reported the incident to the Fourth Public Security Bureau, which sent police to investigate. The police took the deceased's husband, Qi Junqing, and Zhang Yuelan, and Zhang's mother, Li, into the Fourth Public Security Bureau for questioning. Qi Junqing remained calm and gave cunning statements. During the questioning of Zhang Yuelan, she initially claimed to know nothing, but after further interrogation, she confessed that her cousin, Qi Junqing, had gotten up and gone downstairs at around 4:00 AM this morning. She then heard a loud fight, but she didn't dare to say anything. Soon after, her cousin came upstairs, covered in blood. She asked him why he killed her cousin's wife, and he told her not to make a sound. Finally, Zhang's mother, Li, also confessed that Qi Junqing and his wife had always been at odds with each other. After the questioning, they were all detained. At around 2:00 PM, prosecutor Huang Yan, led officials to conduct an autopsy, which confirmed that the deceased was first beaten and then killed. He then ordered the village chief to prepare a coffin and report the case to the court for filing. Prosecutor Huang immediately went to the Fourth Public Security Bureau to summon neighbors and the head of the baojia system to the bureau for questioning before transferring them to the court for further investigation. It is rumored that Qi Junqing and Zhang Yuelan were having an affair, and because of the deceased Lu's knowledge, they committed this heinous crime of murdering his wife.</p>

<p>Based on confidential reports, the First Public Security Bureau of Wuyi County learned that Jiang Lantian, a resident of Dong'an in the Ninth District, was a well-known earthenware smuggler. Police Chief Zhang Xingda investigated and learned that the smuggler had returned to Changzhou from Shanghai with earthenware on the 14th of this month. He waited at the station but found nothing after searching Jiang Lantian. He then released him. Later, he investigated the wharves and other places and learned that another woman had secretly transported a large quantity of smuggled earthenware to Dong'an Town. That night, he went to the town to search and found 63 packages of smuggled earthenware, large and small, on a ferry boat, as well as the boat owner, Dai Sanda, and others. The smuggler Jiang Lantian was also apprehended in the city, and the woman who delivered the earthenware, Wu Yan, was also arrested.

<p>Zhejiang Province has always been short of food. Every year during the period between harvests, rice merchants raise prices, and then lower prices in the fall, hurting farmers. According to those familiar with the food situation, only 12 of the 75 counties in Zhejiang, namely Jiaxing and Huzhou, have a slight surplus of food annually. The remaining 63 counties are not self-sufficient. For example, the production of the seven counties in Shaoxing is 5,150,000 shi, while the demand is 7,850,000 shi, a shortfall of 2,700,000 shi. Even in a year of good harvest like this year in Xiaoshan, it still relies on neighboring counties for food. If there is a famine, the amount of rice shortage will be alarming.</p>

<p>The Formation of the Fourth Route Army</p>
<p>The Guangdong army was repeatedly expanded during the Chen Jitang era, eventually consisting of five armies, each with three divisions, for a total of fifteen divisions. The troop strength was approximately 100,000, and the monthly military expenditure was more than 6 million yuan. After Yu Hanmou took over as the commander-in-chief of the Fourth Route Army, he was ordered to reduce the fifteen divisions to ten divisions, numbered from the First to the Tenth Division. When Chairman Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Guangdong, he reorganized the Guangdong army and brought the Guangdong army's flags and Central Army's flags into sequential order. In particular, he eliminated the local nature of the designations to show unity. Therefore, the designation of the First Division of the Guangdong Army was changed to the 151st Division of the Central Army, and the designation of the Second Division of the Guangdong Army was changed to the 152nd Division of the Central Army, and so on up to the 160th Division. The division commanders were initially not changed, namely Mo Xide as the commander of the 151st Division, Ye Zhao as the commander of the 152nd Division, Zhang Ruigui as the commander of the 153rd Division, Wu Jianxiong as the commander of the 154th Division, Li Hanhun as the commander of the 155th Division, Deng Longguang as the commander of the 156th Division, Huang Zhiwen as the commander of the 157th Division, Zeng Youren as the commander of the 158th Division, Tan Sui as the commander of the 159th Division, and Chen Hanguang as the commander of the 160th Division. Later, Yu Hanmou made slight changes to the division commanders, namely Chen Zhang as the commander of the 152nd Division, while the original commander of the 152nd Division, Ye Zhao, was transferred to be the commander of the 160th Division. Huang Tao was also appointed as the commander of the 157th Division, while the original commanders Huang Zhiwen and Chen Hanguang were transferred to be councillors of the Fourth Route Army Headquarters. Although the Guangdong army was reduced in size by Yu Hanmou and reorganized by Chiang Kai-shek, the number of soldiers dismissed was not large. The troop strength of each division was more substantial than during the Chen Jitang era.</p>
<p>The Fourth Route Army Headquarters decided to divide the province into five military districts and appointed Huang Renhuan, Zhang Lian, Miao Peinan, Li Zhenqiu, and Huang Yanzhen as the commanders of the military districts. The organization of the five military districts was similar to the five pacification zones of the past. It was originally planned to establish them immediately, but Huang Renhuan and others organized a national inspection tour to travel to various provinces to observe military affairs. Therefore, the establishment of the military district headquarters will be delayed for three months. Currently, all pacification matters in the province are carried out by the division commanders under the instructions of Yu Hanmou.</p>
<p>The Fourth Route Army Headquarters was formed by expanding the former First Army Headquarters. Yu Hanmou was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Fourth Route Army as the commander of the First Army, and Li Xu Huan was appointed as the chief secretary of the Fourth Route Army Headquarters as the secretary-general of the First Army. The position of chief of staff of the Fourth Route Army Headquarters should have been filled by Luo Zicai, the chief of staff of the First Army, but Yu Hanmou appointed Xu Jingtang as the chief of staff of the Fourth Route Army Headquarters. It is said that Yu and Xu had a close relationship. At the same time, Yu believed that Xu had good relations with the Guizhou authorities and Li Jishen. Xu also had a good reputation in the Guangdong military, and appointing him as the chief of staff of the Fourth Route Army Headquarters would make it easier to deal with various parties. However, Luo Zicai felt that he had a deep history with the First Army and was unable to be promoted to the position of chief of staff of the Fourth Route Army Headquarters, and he was very disappointed. He resolutely requested to resign. Later, in order to resolve the misunderstanding, Yu Hanmou changed Luo's position to commander of the training brigade. It can be seen that Yu put a lot of effort into this matter. In addition, Huang Zhiwen, the former commander of the 157th Division, and Chen Hanguang, the former commander of the 160th Division, had very close relationships with Chen Jitang. After Chen went into retirement, he ordered Huang and Chen to pledge their allegiance to the central government and introduced Xiang Hanping and Li Yangjing to the central government, requesting that they be appointed. The central government accepted them, appointing Li as the commander-in-chief of the bandit suppression in the Zhejiang-Fujian-Jiangxi border area and planning to lead Huang and Chen's divisions to Fujian. However, the four brigade commanders of the two divisions telegraphed their strong opposition, and Li did not take office. Huang and Chen were relieved of their positions as division commanders, and Yu Hanmou appointed Huang Tao and Ye Zhao as their successors. Huang and Ye had a very close relationship with Yu Hanmou. Therefore, the Guangdong army is very united after Yu Hanmou's repeated measures. In addition to assigning the ten divisions, the Fourth Route Army Headquarters also established an officers' training corps at the old military academy established by Chen Jitang in Yantang, near Guangzhou. The surplus officers from the reduced divisions were all sent to the corps for training, with their salaries paid. In the future, more officers from the divisions may be transferred to the corps for training, in order to give the officers a deeper education. It can be seen that Yu Hanmou is putting a lot of effort into the Fourth Route Army.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Sun Ke Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning: Discusses Tense Situation in Chahar and Suiyuan; Meets Huang Renhuan, Zhang Da, Gong Yanzhen; Awaits Ship to Guangdong to Attend Sun Yat-sen's State Funeral <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, left Beijing by the 11:00 PM express train the night before and arrived at Zhenru Station at 6:50 AM yesterday morning. He returned to his private residence on Columbia Road to rest. Afterwards, he went out briefly. Upon returning to his residence, Huang Renhuan, Zhang Da, and Huang Yanzhen, three military district commanders of the Guangdong Fourth Route Army Domestic Military Inspection Group, accompanied by Wang Zhinan, secretary of the Songhu Garrison Command, visited him around 10:00 AM and had discussions. The meeting lasted about an hour before they departed. Mr. Sun met with reporters from Xin Sheng News Agency at his residence and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Situation in Chahar and Suiyuan</p>
<p>The reporter first inquired about the Sino-Japanese diplomatic issues. Mr. Sun stated that the diplomatic authorities would handle it appropriately, and he did not know the details. Regarding the situation in the north, Mr. Sun said that in eastern Suiyuan and northern Chahar, a certain party had recently instigated puppet troops to invade, creating a tense situation. Chairman of Suiyuan Province, Fu Zuoyi, and Chairman of Chahar Province, Liu Ruming, had already been ordered to dispatch troops to intercept them.</p>
<p>Attitude of Various Countries</p>
<p>Mr. Sun further answered the reporter's question about the attitude of European and American countries towards the current Sino-Japanese situation, stating that there was no clear indication. Europe itself has many disputes. Belgium's declaration of neutrality is intended to warn Germany and Italy, and also implies that it cannot assist France. Currently, China's situation requires self-determination. Regarding the British loan to China, it is not a cash loan but a purchase on credit.</p>
<p>Awaiting Ship South</p>
<p>Mr. Sun was nominated as the Central Representative for the state funeral of the late Chairman Hu of the Central Standing Committee. It is said that he is here awaiting a ship and will be heading south soon. However, it has not yet been decided whether he will travel with Mr. Wang Liangchou on the 20th, or whether President Ju (Zheng), President Xu (Chongzhi), and Mr. Chen Lifu will accompany him. This trip is solely to attend Mr. Hu's state funeral. He will stay in Guangdong for about a week and then return north.</p>

The work was temporarily suspended due to the arrival of the malaria season. Now that the weather is gradually getting colder and the malaria season has passed, he has decided to come to Shanghai again at the end of this month, take a ship to Hong Kong, and enter Yunnan via India to continue the joint survey with the British committee. It is expected that all the work will be completed by early February next year. As for the newly appointed member Zhang Zuyin (from Yunnan), he is reportedly already in Yunnan.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Following the Postponement of the National Assembly, Should Group Re-elections Be Held? Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Submits a Request for Interpretation Yesterday <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday, seeking an interpretation as to whether re-elections of people's organizations should be held following the postponement of the National Assembly. The original request stated: "Regarding the matter of submitting a request, the Silk and Satin Trade Association stated in a letter dated the 15th of this month that the members' general meeting of the trade association is held once a year, and half of the executive and supervisory committee members are re-elected every two years, which has been complied with in the past. Now, with the arrival of the seventh members' general meeting and the re-election of committee members, it was originally intended to be held simultaneously in September of this year, but it was postponed due to the handling of national elections. There is no clear provision on whether the trade association should convene a members' general meeting to re-elect committee members. We are writing to inquire, hoping that your esteemed association will provide detailed instructions so that we can follow them accordingly." The matter was received on August 26th of this year with your esteemed association's Executive Document No. 2481, citing Public Letter No. 3817 from the Central Department of Civil Training, which stated, "In order to strictly ensure the election of National Assembly representatives, after the promulgation of the National Assembly Election Law and before the opening of the National Assembly, all people's organizations in various places, except those undergoing reorganization or with special circumstances and approved by the local senior party headquarters after submitting a report to this department, shall suspend re-elections." Therefore, the holding of re-elections by the association should be postponed until after the opening of the National Assembly in accordance with the aforementioned instructions. However, there are still points that need to be researched, which are presented to your esteemed association separately: (1) The re-election of the association is only for the re-election of executive and supervisory committee members, while companies and firms in the same industry can join the association at any time in accordance with Article 7 of the Association Law. It is not related to the re-election process. According to normal practice, new members should only be suspended from joining the association one month before the re-election, and there are no restrictions at other times. In other words, the intention of postponing the re-election is to restrict the frequent changes of officials during the national election period, and its scope does not include refusing to accept new members. Now, the candidates for the National Assembly representatives to be elected by vocational groups have been nominated separately by the officials of each association, and the task of national elections has come to an end. From now on, the election of National Assembly representatives is the responsibility of the members of each association in accordance with Article 24 of the National Assembly Election Law. Therefore, it seems unnecessary in practice to restrict the re-election of association members until the opening of the National Assembly. (2) The term of office of association officials is four years, with half of them being re-elected every two years, and the standing committee members have a term of two years and can be re-elected once. If the association's re-election is postponed from May 14th of this year, the date of promulgation of the National Assembly Representatives Election Law, to the date of the opening of the National Assembly, the legally mandated term of office not exceeding four years will be broken, and the two-year term of office of the supervisory committee members who can be re-elected once will be extended to three years. If they are re-elected, how will the term of office be calculated? All these obstacles should be documented and submitted to your esteemed association for review, hoping that you will provide instructions for compliance, which will be for the public convenience."</p>
<h3 id="e93">Naming Ceremony for Donated Warplane Rescheduled for the 24th <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The naming ceremony for the warplane presented as a birthday gift to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, originally scheduled for 2:00 PM on the 15th of this month at Longhua Airport, has been rescheduled for the 24th of this month at 2:00 PM at the same location due to insufficient preparation. The decision was made at the first preparatory meeting, and the change has been communicated to various agencies, organizations, and schools. In related news, Mr. Qiu Runchu, owner of the Ewo Brewery, will donate 1,000 cases of beer from his brewery for the audience to enjoy on the day. Also, Mr. Du Yuesheng has been very supportive of the purchase of the warplane, in addition to persuading various entertainment venues, racetracks, dog tracks, and Jai Alai courts in the city to donate one day's revenue, he has now raised 100,000 yuan from merchants in special industries to purchase a warplane, which will be named "Special Industry." The information was personally reported to Mayor Wu by Li Dachao, the chief of the Purchase Aircraft Commemorative.</p>

<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, was hospitalized at the Shanghai Sanitarium &amp; Hospital on Rue Coulmiers at 9:00 AM yesterday due to overwork.

The doctor advised that he should have been hospitalized last month, but he was unable to spare time due to busy official duties. Now that official duties are slightly less pressing, he has been hospitalized. However, his condition is not serious, and he only needs to rest carefully. The doctor has ordered him to refuse visitors to avoid mental strain. He is expected to stay for three weeks, and he will be discharged as soon as he recovers. Official duties of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank will be temporarily handled by the two Vice Ministers Zou Lin and Xu Kan, and Deputy Governor Chen Xing, respectively. Mr. Zou specially took a train from Beijing to Shanghai around 7:00 AM yesterday to seek instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Joint Handling of Domestic Rice Transportation and Discounted Exchange by China, Jiaotong, and Other Banks; Total Amount Tentatively Set at 10 Million Yuan at 7% Interest; Starting with Hunan Rice to Guangdong, Gradually Promoting to Other Areas; Specific Measures to Be Decided Next Week and Undertaken <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, China, Jiaotong, and ten other banks will jointly handle the discounted exchange loan for the transportation and sale of domestic rice in order to assist the government in developing agriculture and regulating food supply. It has been decided to start with Hunan rice to Guangdong, with the total loan amount tentatively set at 10 million yuan. Another meeting will be held next week to determine specific measures, and implementation will begin immediately. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Assisting the Government in Regulating Food Supply</p>
<p>China, Jiaotong, and other banks believe that this year's harvest is abundant in various places, and the government has specifically negotiated with state-owned railways and China Merchants Group and other transportation agencies to reduce transportation prices to facilitate farmers and merchants. In order to assist the government in regulating food supply, it has been proposed to jointly organize various banks to handle the discounted exchange loan for rice transportation and sales. The so-called discounted exchange for transportation and sales is, for example, if a place A has 10,000 yuan worth of rice to be transported to a merchant in place B for sale, the loan can only be obtained after the rice arrives at the destination. If discounted exchange is handled, the seller in place A only needs to transport the goods to place B, and then hand over the bill of lading, insurance policy, invoice, etc. to the bank that handles the discounted exchange to obtain the payment first. After the goods arrive in place B, the buyer in place B will return the payment to the bank and receive the bill of lading to pick up the goods. The bank that handles the transaction will take a commission, which is the interest on the loan.</p>
<p>Three Major Principles for Handling Discounted Exchange</p>
<p>Since the China and Jiaotong Banks initiated the organization, they have invited representatives from various banks to meet at the Bank of China. Initially, the plan was to only handle the discounted exchange loan for Hunan rice to Guangdong. However, according to the opinions of the majority, it was considered that the rice production has increased sharply this year, and if only Hunan rice is handled, the scope seems too narrow. It was decided to expand the scope, and all domestic rice will be accepted for discounted exchange, but only those that meet the following principles and have been negotiated in advance: (1) Rice produced in the Republic of China, (2) Rice that has been formally inspected and qualified by the Ministry of Industry, (3) Rice merchants and customers who have credit in normal times. All rice that meets the above principles will be accepted for processing, and the specific measures for Hunan rice to Guangdong have been negotiated and agreed upon by the two provincial governments. Therefore, it has been decided to start with Hunan rice and gradually promote it to other provinces.</p>
<p>Meeting Next Week to Discuss Implementation Measures</p>
<p>Reporters learned from participating banks yesterday that the organization was initiated by the China and Jiaotong Banks. As of yesterday, the participants included China, Jiaotong, Shanghai, Jin Cheng, Mainland, Yantian, Zhongnan, Guohua, China National Products, and Postal Savings Bureau. The Four Bank Savings Society and the Farmers Bank of China did not participate. At the meeting held at the Bank of China the other day, in addition to deciding on the processing principles, the total loan amount was also tentatively set at 10 million yuan, which will be increased or decreased at any time depending on the needs. The minimum interest rate is 7%, and the loans will be automatically undertaken by each bank. In order to reduce costs, it is not planned to establish a formal banking group, and the China and Jiaotong Banks are publicly nominated as representatives to be responsible for hosting everything. It is planned to convene another meeting of representatives from various banks next week to determine the specific implementation measures, and then implementation will begin immediately. There is no need to sign a contract with any rice merchants or groups.</p>

<p>Seafarer Groups: The Shanghai Seafarers Branch of the Chinese Seafarers' Union and the Middle Cabin Office and seafarer groups in various places, because this year is Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday, and out of respect for the revolutionary leader, initiated the Chinese Seafarers Fundraising Committee to Purchase Warplanes to Celebrate His Birthday, planning to purchase a warplane named "Seafarer" to present on the Generalissimo's birthday. Since the initiation, various parties have enthusiastically contributed. The Middle Cabin Department stipulated four yuan per person, totaling more than 10,000 yuan, which has been deposited in the bank. Other departments such as stevedores, sailors, firemen, stewards, and donations from various places totaled more than 100,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e98">China Merchants Group: Strictly Prohibiting Private Smuggling of Packages <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Group believes that in the past, employees of various ships often smuggled packages privately. The group's freight revenue was affected, and the employees were also committing illegal acts. Moreover, the private smuggling of packages by a few unscrupulous elements affected all employees. Therefore, at the beginning of the rectification, the smuggling of packages was strictly prohibited. It is understood that the group is afraid that the employees of various ships may become lax over time, so it reiterated the ban the other day and ordered the supervisors of various ships to strictly inspect. If any goods are smuggled privately, 30% will be used as a reward, and the rest will be confiscated. The employees who smuggle privately will be punished according to law, so as to fundamentally eliminate smuggling.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Association received a document with a reference number Qian Zi No. 11,105 from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, which stated: "A document submitted on September 28th of this year, requesting the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Loan Review Committee to extend the loan deadline and continue to provide relief to industry and commerce because the market's finances have not yet returned to normal, has been received.

<h3 id="e102">Completion of New Luoxing Pagoda Pier; Director of Fujian Construction Department Arrives in Shanghai to Negotiate; Promoting Shanghai-Fujian Maritime Transport <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Luoxing Pagoda in Fuzhou, also known as Mawei, is an important route for ships to reach Fujian. Commercial ships from various places anchor there. Ships from Shanghai to Fuzhou, such as the Sanbei, China Merchants, Osaka, and Xin Chang'an shipping companies, have always only gone to Mawei, anchoring on buoys to load and unload goods and passengers. Due to water conditions, it was impossible to dock on the shore. Therefore, for decades, no pier had been built. In recent years, the Fujian Construction Department first built a wharf in Nantai and dredged the Hanjiang River to deepen the waterway, so that flat-bottomed ships with a draft of about ten feet can directly reach the Nantai wharf. However, larger sea vessels still cannot transport goods to Nantai. In order to promote freight transport in Fujian Province, the Construction Department raised huge funds to build an unprecedented large pier at the Luoxing Pagoda, deepening the waterway and using the latest construction methods. All warehouses and other facilities have been built. The pier is very large and can accommodate three sea vessels at the same time. The warehouse capacity is even larger. It was completed on October 3rd. On that day, the Shanghai Xinhua'an ship began docking at the new Luoxing Pagoda pier in Mawei, creating an unprecedented record in Fujian shipping history. In order to develop the Luoxing Pagoda pier business, since the transportation center is in Shanghai, Chen, the Director of the Construction Department, and Zhou Liangcai, the Director of the Luoxing Pagoda Pier Management Office, personally came to Shanghai to negotiate with various shipping companies in Shanghai and the leaders of various Fujian merchant groups. From now on, Shanghai-Fujian liners to Fujian, whether for unloading goods or boarding passengers, are requested to dock at the new Luoxing Pagoda pier, which can reduce the trouble and expense of using boats for unloading and transferring for shipping companies and passengers, and create a new era in transportation. Yesterday afternoon, representatives from various shipping companies and passenger companies discussed everything with Director Chen of the Construction Department and Director Zhou.

<h3 id="e103">Shanghai County Government Increases Public Arbitration Committee to Assess Land Price Tax for Newly Built Luoxing Pagoda Pier; Based on the Request of Representatives of Local Associations, Instructions Were Issued to Various District Bureaus Yesterday <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government issued the following instructions yesterday: "According to the submission of Qin Xitian, Chairman of the Local Association, 'The submission is regarding the pre-collection of land price tax, the re-determination of land prices, and a special representative is raising an objection on behalf of all the property owners in the county, requesting that the Public Arbitration Committee be allowed to correct the errors in order to reassure the people and benefit tax revenue.' Our association proposed at a general meeting of members on September 27th of this year, 'How to realistically assess the land price in this county', and decided to conduct a zonal survey of actual land prices for comparison. The method is that in addition to the district head of each district, four people will be responsible for gathering township chiefs to inspect and report separately on purchase and sale deeds and income status in the past five years, and then each district head will submit them to our association to create a table and request the provincial county to correct them. While the district heads of each district were in progress, the county magistrate summoned the people for a joint talk on the 4th of this month. After the people of each district described the evaluation process and the resentment of the villagers, the county magistrate believed that this land price was unfair and inaccurate, and that the handling was hasty and needed to be corrected. According to law, property owners should raise objections, but it seems too cumbersome and causes disturbances for tens of thousands of property owners to request collectively. It was decided that our association would represent the property owners and submit a request to the county magistrate to order the Land Administration Bureau to temporarily increase the number of members on the original Public Arbitration Committee by ten, and to conduct an in-depth study with calm and composure, striving for appropriate prices, increasing or decreasing the current land prices separately, determining the standard for the tax amount, without hindering the provincial and county budgets and without increasing the burden on the farmers, so as to benefit both officials and the people. However, the procedures are complicated and cannot be handled in a short time. The autumn harvest is now underway, and the land price tax cannot be delayed because of this. It is proposed to collect the first installment of 50% of the tax first, and when the second installment is collected, the tax amount will be revised based on the revised land price. If the first installment is overpaid by more than 50% according to the new amount, the overpaid amount will be used to offset the tax for this installment, and if it is less than 50%, it will be paid in this installment. Such a flexible approach will comply with the law and the public opinion, which is truly a win-win situation. It is proposed to ask the county magistrate to approve the implementation before the land price tax is levied, and to distribute it to the various district offices so that the public can know it, so that the people's hearts can be stabilized and they can enthusiastically contribute. It is the blessing of the local area and the gift of the county magistrate. Therefore, in addition to ordering the submission to be noted, checking the implementation of the land price tax is the land policy set by the late Premier, and this county has been ordered to implement it on a trial basis, relying on the local talents to help and support it to be successful. The association suggested that ten members be added to the Public Arbitration Committee and properly arbitrated under the principle of not hindering the provincial and county budgets and not increasing the burden on the farmers. It is feasible for the association to recommend ten Public Arbitration Committee members who are property owners to the county for investigation. In addition to ordering the Land Tax Department to rush to start the levy procedure and the Land Administration Bureau to convene arbitration, the District Bureau is hereby notified to comply with this order.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Shanghai West People's Education Experimental Zone: Building Minsheng Avenue, Utilizing Labor Service Opportunities, Approved at Yesterday's Road Construction Meeting <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai West Minsheng Education Experimental Zone held a road construction meeting yesterday at 6:00 PM at the General Guidance Office on Zhongshan Road to discuss the construction of Minsheng Avenue. Over twenty people, including zone staff and public representatives, attended. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After formal greetings, Chairman Tang Maohuai first reported, stating briefly: "Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, 'The priority of construction is people's livelihood.' The 'construction' and 'people's livelihood' that we invite you all to discuss today are precisely these two terms. This zone has specially adopted them for naming the avenue we are building. We call it 'Minsheng Avenue.' Since this road is designed and built by this zone and is also a thoroughfare for the livelihood of most residents of West Shanghai, naming it 'Minsheng Avenue' truly has the meaning of 'commemoration' and 'seeking survival.' In particular, the eastern starting point of the road, from Zhongshan Road to Jinjia Lane, is the first section of the road. Previously, this zone had requested the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works to allocate garbage and coal ash to widen and build it, but now it has sunk and become bumpy after a long time. In addition to this zone submitting a request to the Public Works Department for subsidy of coal ash, which has already been delivered, it is estimated that a large amount of money is needed for earth carrying and filling work. It is not possible for a small number of people to achieve results, so we have specially invited you all to discuss how to proceed with the construction. Please express your opinions as much as possible and discuss together," and so on.</p>
<p>Start of Discussion</p>
<p>Following that, discussions were held on: (1) Stipulating the starting and ending points of the first section of Minsheng Avenue; (2) How to use the opportunity to promote labor service; (3) The draft fundraising proposal has been prepared, please revise it; (4) Electing fundraising committee members to be solely responsible; (5) Stipulating November 1st as the naming ceremony for Minsheng Avenue.</p>
<p>Labor Service</p>
<p>The road construction committee considers that the staff of the zone are all comrades who have taken off their long gowns and are sincerely guiding the people. Therefore, to show sympathy for this move, the committee specifically resolved to organize the Minsheng Education Staff Labor Service Team, the Jinjia Lane No. 2 Society Labor Service Team, the Rickshaw Cooperative Labor Service Team, and the Jin Lane Elementary School Student Labor Service Team, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Banking and Money Industries Ordered to Report on the Situation of Closed Businesses and Liquidation: Yesterday, Members That Were Already Closed Were Instructed to Comply <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has appointed supervisors to liquidate closed banks and money shops, working together with the respective trade associations. The liquidation period is set at three months from the date of closure. Later, the supervisors of various banks and money shops stated reasons and requested an extension of the liquidation period. After review, the ministry has granted extensions as appropriate. Now that the extended deadline has passed, yesterday, the Shanghai Banking and Money Industries Association was again ordered to submit a list of the liquidation status of banks and money shops that closed in the 23rd and 24th years of the Republic, and the amount that has been repaid and not repaid, for verification. After receiving the order, the association immediately instructed the member businesses that had closed to comply. As for non-member businesses, the Ministry of Finance will separately order the respective businesses to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Ministry of Finance Unifies the Issuance of Subsidiary Coin Notes, Provincial Banks Form Group Organizations, Provincial Banks or Local Banks Exchange Drafts and Redeem Subsidiary Coin Notes to Benefit Travelers <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated concrete measures for the unified issuance of subsidiary coin notes. Provincial banks or local banks have all complied. The Jiangxi Yumin, Zhejiang Local, and Jiangsu Farmer Banks have formed group organizations, exchanging drafts and redeeming subsidiary coin notes to facilitate finance. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Unifies Subsidiary Coin Note Issuance</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance stipulated that subsidiary coin notes should be issued by provincial banks or local banks, it has stipulated measures for the sake of unifying subsidiary coin notes. Any provincial bank or local bank that prints subsidiary coin notes should state the reasons in detail and submit the design, type, quantity, scheduled manufacturing date, and completed manufacturing date of the subsidiary coin notes to the ministry for approval before manufacturing. As for the printing of subsidiary coin notes, it should be done by the ministry. Previously, the issuance of subsidiary coin notes by provincial banks and local banks was only approved by the provincial governments and had not been approved by the Ministry of Finance. The area of use was also limited to various places within the province.</p>
<p>Banks Issuing Subsidiary Coin Notes</p>
<p>Banks issuing subsidiary coin notes: (1) The Jiangsu Farmer Bank has been approved by the Ministry of Finance to issue subsidiary coin notes worth 3 million yuan, which will be used to withdraw the subsidiary coin notes previously issued by the Xuzhou Ping City Official Money Bureau, and they are already circulating in the market. (2) The 500,000 yuan of subsidiary coin notes previously issued by the Zhejiang Local Bank have been received by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee. A new request has been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval to issue 8 million yuan of subsidiary coin notes, and 3 million yuan have been approved and will be entrusted to a printing company for printing. (3) The subsidiary coin notes previously issued by the Jiangxi Yumin Bank have now been reported to the Ministry of Finance for record. (4) As for other provincial banks or local banks issuing subsidiary coin notes, they will resolutely apply to the Ministry of Finance for record according to law.</p>
<p>Local Bank Group Organizations</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the Zhejiang Local Bank, Jiangxi Yumin Bank, Jiangsu Farmer Bank, etc., considering that the subsidiary coin notes of various banks are only allowed to circulate in various places within the province and are always rejected for use across provinces, which is very inconvenient for travelers, have decided to form group organizations for the sake of mutual communication. In the future, provincial banks or local banks will, in addition to exchanging drafts, redeem subsidiary coin notes for each other. It has been decided that the Jiangxi Yumin and Zhejiang Local Banks will first conduct a trial, and then gradually promote it to make it popular throughout the country.</p>

<p>In recent years, overseas Chinese compatriots living in the South Seas Islands have faced difficulties in making a living due to the impact of the global depression. Fifteen overseas Chinese compatriots living in Samarinda, East Borneo, Dutch East Indies, who had been operating as vendors there for more than ten years, were recently unable to obtain business licenses and were deported back to China by the Dutch authorities. Among them, fourteen people were all of Cantonese origin. After returning to Hong Kong, they went back to their original homes. There was also one person, Huang Boying (40 years old, living in the South Seas for 17 years), who was from Suining County, Sichuan. He took the Haikou Wheel from Hong Kong and arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. Having run out of money, he applied to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for relief. Yesterday, the bureau transferred him to the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, which consulted with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to send him to Wuhan on the Jiangxin Wheel and then transfer him to his original home in Sichuan.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Cabin Crew of the Tongzhou Wheel Reduced, Workers to Draw Lots Tomorrow: 113 People Reduced to 50 <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, because the old Shanghai-Ningbo line's Xin Beijing ship owned by the British Taikoo Company was old, it was suspended this spring, and the Tongzhou Wheel was renamed Xin Beijing to replace it. However, because the Tongzhou Wheel's hull is narrow, it is difficult to accommodate the cabin crew of the two ships. (According to reports, the Tongzhou Wheel has 15 people, and the Beijing has 158 people, totaling 173 people. Since the old Xin Beijing was cut, all the workers have been working on the Tongzhou Wheel.) Therefore, the purser of the ship advocated reducing the number to 65 people. All the workers opposed this and requested the Seamen's Union Cabin Office to negotiate. Yesterday, the China Seamen's Union specially sent Secretary Wang Qi and Section Chief Wu Ya, together with Zhao Shijing from the branch, to negotiate with the company authorities. As a result, the company agreed to increase 15 more people, for a total of 80 people. (Among the 80 people, 15 old Tongzhou workers and 15 representatives of the Xin Beijing will not be cut. Among the remaining 143 people, 50 people will be drawn out for employment.) As for the dismissed workers, the purser will give each of them a severance payment of 83 yuan. At that time, both parties felt satisfied and declared a resolution. It was decided that a draw will be held at 10:00 AM on Monday at the cabin office to decide who stays and who goes. At the same time, the workers, feeling the pain of unemployment, decided that those who are drawn to continue to serve and the representatives will each contribute 90 yuan to distribute to the unemployed workers to maintain their livelihood.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Imperial University Professor Konaka Publishes a Paper: China's Anti-Japanese Resistance Relies on Europe and America, Which Is the Result of Japan's Policy <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency Fukuoka Telegram: Konaka Tsugi, a professor at the Japanese Imperial University, recently wrote an article in the Fukuoka Nichinichi Shimbun, the largest newspaper in western Japan, entitled "The Skill of Diplomacy," criticizing the inappropriateness of Japan's diplomacy towards China.</p>
<p>Diplomatic Blunder: Konaka stated that Japan's diplomacy towards China should target the National Government headed by President Chiang Kai-shek. "If Chiang's position collapses, Japan may have no way to find a counterpart for diplomacy towards China." Therefore, the current Japanese propaganda of "Chiang's insincerity, etc." is actually a diplomatic blunder. Konaka continued, "China's reliance on Europe and America" is the result of Japan's clumsy diplomacy towards China. "Although China has many dissatisfactions with Europe and America, the reason why anti-Japanese resistance has become an important issue is all because of the result of Japan's diplomacy towards China, which has caused even pro-Japanese elements in China to turn to anti-Japanese resistance."</p>
<p>Bizarre Argument: Japan's understanding of China should be fundamentally changed. Those who advocate the theory that the Chinese nation cannot be unified have an unparalleled adverse effect on diplomacy towards China. Zhu stated, "We believe that if there is no existence of Chiang Kai-shek, there is absolutely no possibility of discovering the relationship between the revival of Sino-Japanese friendship. His short-sighted diplomacy towards China is the cause of the current crisis." According to reports, Professor Konaka is an authority on Japanese political science and diplomatic history. During the September 18th Incident, he wrote articles attacking the military's aggression against China. The above views are quite representative of the psychology of a part of the Japanese intelligentsia.</p>

In addition to the Xiong sisters' classmates and relatives holding farewell banquets, the general manager of Daxin Company also represented his colleagues at a banquet last night, wishing the three heroines the greatest success in their overseas trip, which would add a special color to the art world and young women's circles. It is heard that after the closing of the Xiong sisters' painting exhibition, they will wait for a ship back to Guangdong, and sail from Hong Kong to foreign countries. Their stay in Shanghai will be no more than a few days.</p>

<p>According to Central News Agency, Xu Qixing, a young Chinese aviator who made a long-distance flight between Java and the Netherlands last September, is now carrying out his long-distance flight back to his homeland from Java. The aircraft he is flying is still the small aircraft Walraven that he flew to the Netherlands before. He is accompanied only by his wife, Ms. Huang. His route is from Batavia, through Palembang in Sumatra, Singapore, Alor Star, Bangkok. If the weather is bad, he will not go to Siam but go directly to Saigon in Annam, heading to Hanoi, and then to Hong Kong, and then fly through Guangzhou and Xiamen to enter Beijing via Shanghai, to complete his long-distance flight from the capital of the Dutch East Indies to the capital of China. It is reported that Xu's flight is not making any records, but its purpose is to tour the motherland, investigate the recent situation of the aviation industry, and test the safety and speed of the aircraft made by the Dutch East Indies factory. He studied flying with Dutch officers in 1933, and because he had close contact with the technical staff of the Dutch East Indies aircraft factory, he had long had the desire to engage in the aviation industry. In 1934, he published his opinions on establishing an aircraft factory. When he went to the Netherlands last year, he went to the UK on the way and contacted various factories. As a result, everything was very satisfactory. This time he returned to China to investigate the aviation industry of the motherland as a reference. Xu is originally from Xiamen, an overseas Chinese student in Bondowoso, East Java. His family is quite wealthy, and he received a good education since childhood. He is proficient in English, Dutch, and other languages. He is only over thirty years old and is a promising youth in China.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Medical Masterpiece: Photographic Reprint of Medical Records Examination <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The book "Medical Records Examination" was written by Tanba Motoyasu of Japan. The entire book has 80 volumes and collects a total of 3,300 kinds of Chinese medical books. It almost comprehensively collects medical books from history to before the Daoguang period. Following the example of Zhu Yizun's "Classical Meaning Examination", each book first records the number of volumes, existence, and preface, and then Motoyasu's research. By examining one book, one can know the source and details of the book. By reading this book, the medical origins and schools of thought in China for thousands of years can be seen at a glance. The book was completed but not published. Last year, his country began to publish the original manuscript in photographic reprint. Each copy costs 120 yuan, which is not affordable for general readers. For the sake of promoting the inherent culture, the Chinese and Western Medicine Research Society of this city is reprinting the original book, combining four pages into one page. The font is still larger than size four, which not only preserves the original appearance but also eliminates the danger of typesetting errors. However, the original book has a vast number of subheadings, and it is quite difficult to find and check them. Therefore, the names of the medical books and the names of the authors collected in the book are separately compiled into a "Book Title Index" and "Personal Name Index", which are attached to the end of the book. It is not only convenient to check, but also one can immediately find out which book was written by which person and how many kinds were written by someone. All these practical advantages have exceeded the original book. Anyone who wants to study national medicine and study the history of Chinese culture must have it. Since the society issued the pre-order, the pre-orders have been quite enthusiastic. For example, Xu Senyu of the National Peiping Library pre-ordered as many as 18 copies at once, which shows how much it is valued by the cultural circle. Therefore, the 500 copies have long been exceeded. However, because some people have already purchased the "Medical Records Examination" published by a bookstore with a 30% discount, which is full of errors and completely unrecognizable, they have requested the society to add a few more copies to correct them. Therefore, the society will respond to their request to cope with it. There are still a few copies left for special sale. The book is printed on high-quality Lian Shi paper, divided into four large volumes, with magnetic blue paper covers and a specially made book box, which can be used as a shelf for hardcover books. The real price is 8 yuan, the special price is 85% off (plus 23 cents for postage per book). Schools and libraries that purchase them will get a 75% discount (limited to direct purchases from the society). The deadline is October 22nd. From October 23rd to November 22nd, the special price is 90% off, and schools and libraries get an 80% discount (method is the same as above). The real price will be sold after the deadline. There are not many books left, so purchase them as soon as possible. Those who have already sent a pre-order should pay the book price and pick up the books before November 22nd, otherwise it will be invalid.

<p>Dagon News Agency reported that the Changshu Public Office of this city presented to the Municipal Party Headquarters the other day, requesting a letter to the Jiangsu Shanghai Local Court to stop the auction of the Public Office's real estate to protect property rights. The original report stated that the report was for the purpose of requesting the Court to stop the auction of real estate belonging to the Changshu Public Office. It was secretly investigated that since the 28th year of the Qing Dynasty, the Shangchangshu Lühu Rice Shipping Merchants raised funds to build it (the address is No. 31 Xinxin Street outside Dadongmen, Shanghai). Later, due to the lack of leadership, the office affairs were extremely corrupt. The disputes between the ship merchants and the merchants were almost never resolved. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, in order to determine the property rights, they were involved in court litigation. There was a Cao Zhenqing who, under the name of the chairman of the Changshu Lühu Fellow Villagers Association, claimed to assist the ship merchants in disputing the property. At that time, the ship merchants were ignorant and were tempted. Cao had a strong desire for profit and acted recklessly, stealing the land practice certificate of the public office and mortgaging it to the Pudong Bank, which was extremely illegal. The ship merchants were all deceived by him. Now that the Pudong Bank has filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai Local Court, the property of the office will be auctioned off soon. Moreover, on the public notice posted by the Local Court, there are words such as auctioning the real estate of Xu Zaixiang. The office was extremely shocked after seeing this public notice. After investigation, there has never been a Xu Zaixiang among the members, ship merchants, directors, or staff of the office. This kind of misattribution is extremely contradictory. Now that the auction is imminent, it is urgent. Out of desperation, we have prepared this document and presented it to your organization, hoping that you will consider the difficulty of forming a group and quickly forward it to the Shanghai Local Court to stop the auction and protect property rights. This is for the public convenience. Respectfully presented to the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters, the Shanghai Changshu Public Office, Vice Chairman Shi Zufu, Lu Muqin respectfully presented.</p>

<h3 id="e125">### Lu Furen Denies Writing Letters; Threatening Letters Have Identical Handwriting; Bi Songyou Receives Three Letters in a Row; Zhou Guohua Probably Doesn't Exist <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Lu Furen, a 33-year-old man from Yangzhou, works as a cook in the kitchen of a shoe workshop run by his fellow townsman Guan Peiren at 523 Haichang Road, Zhabei, on the third floor. On the 10th, 15th, and 23rd of last month, he three times falsely used the name Zhou Guohua to write three threatening letters to Bi Songyou, a fellow townsman who owns a leather shoe workshop at 7 Guian Lane, Mintini Yin Road, French Concession, demanding 250 yuan, or else his entire family would be in mortal danger. If sincere, he was to send a letter to Zhou Guohua at the Tianshun Congee Shop, 523 Haichang Road, for negotiation, and so on. After receiving the letters, Bi reported to the French police. They prepared a letter in the same style and sent it by registered mail through the post office. Meanwhile, detectives from the police station, along with detectives from the Public Security Bureau, went to the Tianshun Congee Shop to lie in wait. They saw postal worker No. 579 deliver the letter to the Tianshun Congee Shop, where Lu accepted it. Lu then invited Guan Peiren, the owner of the shop, to go to the Taishan Temple Lower Courtyard at No. 4 Yongqing Lane on the same road to ask him to stamp the postal receipt. The detectives then arrested Lu, took him back to the Public Security Bureau, and brought him back to the French police station for interrogation and investigation. The Police Department has completed its investigation and confirmed that the handwriting on the threatening letters is identical to that of the defendant Lu Furen. Yesterday, Chen Shuoying, a judge from the Second Special District Court, continued the trial in the first criminal court. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the Police Department, explained the case and filed charges under Article 346 of the Criminal Code. When questioned, the defendant claimed that Zhou Guohua had asked him to receive the letter on his behalf and that he had not written any letters to the plaintiff to threaten and extort money. When asked where Zhou lived, he could not answer. The court verified the confession and announced the end of the debate, scheduling the sentencing for the 24th. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Ningbo Sojourners Association in Shanghai Petitions for Relaxation of Bans on Logging and Gathering in Zhenhai <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Ningbo Sojourners Association in Shanghai submitted a petition to the Director of Civil Affairs of the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Magistrate of Zhenhai County, stating: "Respectfully submitted, as per a joint letter from over twenty citizens of Zhenhai County, including Zhou Xutai, Yu Yunjiao, Wang Shangxiong, and Gu Jiaqiao, Zhenhai's four rural areas are mostly mountainous with barren soil. In addition to farming, the villagers also engage in logging and gathering firewood. In the past, private and government-owned mountains were open to the collection of both grass and firewood. Those poor people who had no fields to cultivate could make a living in this way. Since the county government designated the coastal mountain land along the river as protected forest, strictly prohibiting felling and issuing a general order stating that 'once afforestation has taken place on public or private mountain land, the mountains will be closed and the cutting of firewood will be prohibited.' The afforestation personnel of the fortress presented a document to the county government to ban logging, also including the words 'near the fortress area,' resulting in both a wide range of afforestation and the boundaries of the felling ban being further confused. The implementation measures for forest protection promulgated by the province were analysed in minute detail, the items were numerous and the network became denser. After closely examining the orders issued by the province and county, in a nutshell, it could be said that all mountains were banned and no firewood could be gathered. Will the villagers get used to the bans and obediently listen to orders? The people of the 20th century, in today's material evolution, will certainly find it difficult to live the life of the primitive era of drinking blood and eating fur, and they cannot break bones for fuel or cremate bones for cooking. Thus, if one man trips, eight mouths go hungry; if one corner of a mountain is closed, a thousand families starve. Will they be forced to engage in banned logging and gathering for a living? The distinction between prohibited and non-prohibited areas is unclear, the grass and forests are dense, and traps abound. Police and clerks extort and frame, and as long as an axe is held, a crime will be immediately committed. Moreover, burial in the plains is not allowed, and now the mountains are closed and cultivation is prohibited, so the dead will be left exposed and the coffins will be stopped forever. The ban above is strict and severe, and the situation below is painful and miserable. Alas, we have no complaints. The common people are wandering on the crossroads of life and death. Obeying orders is not possible, and disobeying orders is not possible. We feel trapped and do not know what to do. Since this year, poor people from several rural towns, such as Gaotang and Yongfeng, have been cutting pine branches on sacrificial mountains or mowing firewood on the foothills, resulting in more than a dozen people being detained and imprisoned one after another, and the cases in other rural areas that have been concluded and have not been made public are not included. The citizens live in the mountains and fields and see the suffering. The common people are weeping and speaking out, and it is difficult for us to remain silent. Therefore, we have something to offer and ask to pass it on to the authorities. We respectfully submit the following points based on our limited knowledge: (1) The afforestation area should be clearly demarcated. (2) The afforestation area should be allowed to cut firewood at any time. (3) The afforestation area should be allowed to harvest the grown trees at any time by the mountain owner. (4) The afforestation area should be allowed to cultivate and bury people at any time. In short, although the forest regulations have been promulgated for a long time, the implementation of afforestation is still a pioneering undertaking in our county. Moreover, the laws and regulations for protecting forests should take banning the felling of trees as the only principle. Now, they are exceeding the principle and cracking down on firewood, which is contrary to the original intention of the legislation. As the magistrate pointed out, if this continues for less than ten years, the old forest land will be transformed into thorny bushes, and logging will not be possible, and burial will not be possible. The survival and demise of both are like being hung upside down. The citizens have listed the above points, although the case involves changing historical policies and decrees, and is related to the government's major plans for consolidating the country and eliminating disasters, the general principles are still not in conflict. Your association maintains the homeland, and the six counties admire it. Therefore, we do not hesitate to speak out and offer our humble opinions. We respectfully request that you quickly send a letter to the relevant authorities and ask for a decree for the villagers. The future of the people's livelihood is deeply dependent on it. The association has received the above sentiments. After investigating the various points stated by the citizens, they are all essential. Therefore, we send this letter for your review and approval. Please instruct the Zhenhai County Government to make detailed regulations and announce them to the public for the benefit of all."</p>

<p>Xu Binxiang, 33 years old, from Jiangyin, resides at 75 Singapore Road, Shanghai West. Yesterday morning, due to carelessness with fire, his mosquito net suddenly caught fire and burned. Neighbors notified the fire brigade by telephone, and they rushed to the scene. However, Xu had already extinguished the fire.

<h3 id="e130">Prosecutor Investigates Assassination of Xuansheng Case; Takes Criminal to Perform On-Site <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau cracked the case of the assassination of a Japanese man named Xuansheng. The criminals Wang Zhensheng, Mao Yonghu, Zhao Yunhong, Jin Daohong, and women Wang Wangshi and Zhang Moshi, a total of six people, confessed to the crime. A pistol was seized and handed over to the local court for trial. It is reported that this case was originally investigated by Prosecutor Xie Lian. Now, Chief Prosecutor Zhu Huanqi believes that this assassination case involves international relations and has a political background with counter-revolutionary elements, and is not comparable to an ordinary murder case. In addition to personally supervising the investigation procedures, he also believes that the investigating prosecutor should be rich in experience and knowledge and carefully question the suspects. Because it is difficult for only one prosecutor to handle the case comprehensively, he has specially appointed Prosecutor Lei Binzhang to assist Prosecutor Xie in the investigation. After repeated interrogations, Wang Zhensheng confessed that he was instigated by Hua Ke to fire the gun and assassinate Xuansheng. He then threw the pistol into the garbage pile under the Hujia Wooden Bridge in Hongkou, and then fled back to the Changfa Inn. However, he claimed that the pistol was hidden by him, and Mao Yonghu took it out and shot Xuansheng, and then returned the pistol to him, and then he threw it away. The situation seemed quite unreasonable. However, Mao Yonghu confessed that the pistol was given to Mao by Li Ruiwu when they met at Zhao Yunhong's house, and Mao gave it to Wang Zhensheng, and Wang Zhensheng discarded it after the assassination. When Zhao Yunhong was questioned, he claimed that Mao Yonghu was his apprentice, and he was entrusted by Li Ruiwu, and Li was given a secret order by Hua Ke, and then Mao told Wang Zhensheng to carry out the assassination. The pistol used to kill the victim was recovered by the Public Security Bureau together with Wang from the garbage pile at the Hujia Wooden Bridge. The bullets were also very similar to the wounds of the deceased. However, after reading the confessions, it is still unclear who fired the gun. According to the circumstances, Wang Zhensheng is of course the person who actually carried out the crime. However, in order to confirm the truth, yesterday morning, Prosecutors Lei and Xie, accompanied by two bailiffs, escorted Wang Zhensheng in a car to the Hujia Wooden Bridge where the gun was thrown and the Gongmei Road where the murder occurred. Together with the police officers from the Linping Road Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, they performed an on-site demonstration, and then took him back to the court for detention.</p>

<p>In view of the upcoming opening of the Municipal Museum, and in order to enrich the content and promote national products, the museum has sent a letter to the China National Products Manufacturers Association, asking it to collect trademarks from various national product manufacturers and send them to the museum for display, so that visitors can recognize the trademarks of national products.

In order to enrich the content and promote national products, we plan to collect various trademarks of national products and display them publicly, so that visitors can recognize the trademarks of national products, which may be helpful in promoting national products. We have always known that your association is the leading organization of national product manufacturers, and we would like to ask you to collect national product trademarks and send them to our museum for display. We hereby request your approval and a reply.' We have approved this request. The museum's display of national product trademarks will encourage visitors to use national products, which is very beneficial to the national product movement. Moreover, the museum will be officially opened soon, and there will certainly be many visitors every day. All our national product factories should send their registered product trademarks directly to the museum at Funan Zuo Road, Municipal Central District, for display, so as to achieve effective publicity. This is what we hope for."</p>

<p>A Jewish man, Abraham (transliteration), 48 years old, was a vegetable vendor. One month ago, he rented a bungalow from Yao Fang, a local woman, at 57, Lane 644, Hart Road, for a monthly rent of nine yuan. On the night of the 15th and the morning before, he was attacked with a hammer and a wood-splitting axe and died. The murderer fled the scene. At 6:00 AM the morning before, Yao Fang was sweeping the street in the lane when she suddenly saw that the door of No. 57 was wide open. Suspicious, she went inside to investigate and found that the man had collapsed and died in the room. Her son, Yunsheng, reported the case to the Gordon Road Police Station, which dispatched Chief Detective Zhu Mengwei and Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. Two murder weapons with bloodstains were found next to the body, and it was discovered that he had considerable savings. Therefore, the cause of the murder seemed to be for money. His body was sent to Hongen Hospital for a brief examination and then transferred to the Ferron Road autopsy center. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court commissioned Prosecutor Song Genshan, along with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, to come to the center to examine the body. According to the report of the Chinese and foreign detectives, Yao Yunsheng, 37 years old, a local native, who works in printing and lives in the front bungalow in Lane 644, Hart Road, stated that the house where the deceased lived was his property and that he had rented it for one month and sixteen days and had paid him two months' rent. He had no family members. Yesterday morning, his mother went to sweep the floor in the lane and saw that his door was open, went inside, and found that he was dead. After obtaining the confession of Mr. Zhu, it was ordered that the deceased, the Jewish man Abraham, had died from injuries sustained before his death.

<h3 id="e140">Shen's Family Lawsuit Over Property - Adopted Son Petitions for Co-residence with Adoptive Mother - Defendant Fails to Appear, Mediation Impossible - Plaintiff Should Pay Fee and File Lawsuit <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Shen Xingquan, a local boy living in a bungalow in Shenjia Bang, at the intersection of Route Frelaut and Avenue Dubail in the French Concession, is eleven years old this year. His grandmother, Madam Shen Ma, has petitioned for mediation to co-reside with his adoptive mother, Shen Huang, who is also his aunt. The petition also addresses Huang's limited management rights but no ownership rights regarding the estate of her deceased husband, Miao Fa, and the inheritance of the estate of his adoptive father, Shen Miao Fa. The petition states that Shen Ma's husband, Shen Hairong, had two sons: the elder son was named Xitang, and the younger son was named Miao Fa. The elder son, Xitang, had one son, who is the petitioner, Shen Xingquan. Shen Miao Fa unfortunately passed away in 1928. His wife, Shen Huang, who is the defendant, initially stayed at home to uphold her commitment but left without saying goodbye after less than a year, taking away property deeds and assets, and has not returned since. Before his death, Shen Miao Fa, knowing he was seriously ill, personally designated the petitioner, Shen Xingquan, as his dual-lineage heir. After Shen Huang left, Shen Ma, as the grandmother, became Xingquan's guardian. It is also stated that since 1926, Shen Hairong had been unable to manage family affairs due to illness. His elder son, Xitang, took advantage of his father's confused state to demand a division of the family property, dividing all assets between Xitang and Miao Fa for management. If the two of them could maintain the family business, the petitioner's parents and Shen Shen, an aunt who is now eighty-two years old, could still rely on it for their livelihood. Unexpectedly, the elder son, Xitang, became frivolous and squandered all the property he received. The younger son, Miao Fa, unfortunately died young. The deeds to the five fen of field at No. 348, Zan Zi Wei, Er Tu, 27 Bao, Shangyi, and the nine fen, nine li, six hao of field at No. 380 in the same Wei, along with the documentation for three houses on the land, were all taken away by the defendant, Shen Huang. She then used her name to obtain a license from the Land Bureau. Shen Hairong, not understanding the law, was involved in lawsuits for five years and suffered adverse rulings. Shen Huang claims to be upholding her commitment, but under the circumstances, there is clear concealment. Therefore, the petitioner requests that the defendant be ordered to return home to co-reside, which is in line with both reason and law, it is claimed. According to the petition, the court, presided over by Judge He in Civil Division Four yesterday morning, attempted mediation. Only the petitioner and his lawyer appeared; the defendant did not appear. After the petitioner's side explained the reasons for requesting mediation, the court, noting the defendant's absence, declared the mediation unsuccessful and instructed the petitioner to formally file a lawsuit.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Special First District Court Summons - Sheng Qunhe Embezzlement Case - Discrepancies in the Received Construction Costs - Defendant Retains Lawyer After Court Adjourns <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Wei Qingji Construction Company at 506 Zhongwang Lane, Ningbo Road, is owned by Wei Qingtao from Shaoxing, who hired Sheng Changan from Ningbo as manager. The company previously undertook the construction of the Shanghai Naval Hospital for the Navy Department, with over 20,000 yuan in construction fees still outstanding. Later, both Wei and Sheng passed away, and Wei's son, Nai Pu, took over the company. Sheng Changan's son, Sheng Qunhe, told Wei Naipu that the remaining construction fees from the Naval Hospital could not be obtained without his intervention with the director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, and that considerable expenses would be required. Wei Naipu then entered into a contract with him, agreeing to give him one-third of the recovered amount as a reward. Subsequently, Sheng recovered 10,000 yuan. After deducting the reward, he also donated 1,050 yuan to the Huangpu Military Academy Alumni Association, 200 yuan to the Fujian Pengfeng School, and 500 yuan for certain expenses, paying only 4,916 yuan to Wei, which was half of the 10,000 yuan. He also failed to collect the full amount. The remaining fees were to be paid by the Navy Department in eight installments. Recently, Wei sent a letter to the Navy Department to investigate and discovered various discrepancies on Sheng's part. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit against Sheng Qunhe in the Special First District Court, accusing him of embezzlement and requesting that he be punished under Article 335 of the Criminal Code, along with an accompanying civil lawsuit demanding the return of 11,684 yuan in national currency. The Special First District Court had previously summoned him, but the trial was suspended because the defendant's whereabouts were unknown. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Chuan Lin summoned him again in Criminal Division Eight. The plaintiff requested that the summons be entrusted to Fenghua and other places for service, which the court approved, ordering a rescheduled hearing. Immediately after the court adjourned, Sheng Qunhe suddenly retained lawyers Zhan Jifeng and Li Lin, who appeared in court. The judge informed them that the case had been rescheduled and instructed the defendant to appear in court for questioning at the next hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Xu Yi's Private Prosecution - Dismissed and Incorrect Jurisdiction - Due to Narrowing of Scope of Private Prosecution - Changed to Suing the Prosecutor <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Lawyer Xu Yi (also known as Jingxian) was previously sued by Li Quanshen (also known as Li Hairong), the manager of the Gen Taihe Flour Mill, in the Shanghai District Court and the Special First District Court, accused of forgery and other crimes. As a result, in the District Court case, Xu was sentenced to four months in prison, but the appeal was declared not guilty. In the Special First District Court case, Xu was sentenced to eight months in prison, but the appeal was rejected. After the bribery case involving Judge Tan Zhuohong of the District Court and lawyer Yang Shaopeng, Xu Yi believed that his case in the District Court was presided over by Tan and that the lawyer hired by Li et al. was Yang Shaopeng, and that Yang's fees reached 4,000 yuan. Therefore, he believed that Li was suspected of bribery. He then filed a private prosecution in the Special First District Court against Li Quanshen and Hu Zhetin (Cheng Linsheng's accountant, who signed the retainer agreement for lawyer Yang on his behalf) for bribery and false accusation, along with an accompanying civil lawsuit. The Special First District Court had summoned them several times, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide continued the hearing in Criminal Division One. Judge Feng immediately declared to Xu Yi that the scope of the private prosecution had now been narrowed. Recently, the Supreme Court issued a precedent stating that bribery and perjury are both harms to national interests and cannot be privately prosecuted, only prosecuted by the prosecutor. Furthermore, you cannot present evidence in this case, and the High Court has also determined that the parts of the Tan case involving this case are not valid, so this court cannot accept it. As for your accusation of false accusation, it falls under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai District Court, so this court also believes that the jurisdiction is incorrect. Xu Yi then stated that he was adding an accusation against the defendant for violating Articles 125 and 132 of the Criminal Code, abuse of power, which concerns personal interests and should be accepted by your court. Judge Feng immediately stated that the provisions of that article only apply to officials who have the power to punish crimes. Since Li Quanshen is not an official, how can the crime of this article apply? Xu immediately stated that he would report the bribery and other matters to the prosecutor. Judge Feng then ruled that the part of the lawsuit against Li Hairong and Hu Zhetin for bribery was not accepted, and the accompanying civil lawsuit was rejected. The lawsuit against Li Hairong for false accusation, and the accompanying civil lawsuit, should be dismissed due to incorrect jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Yang Weiren from Ningbo is an accountant at a money shop in Kobe, Japan, and Jiang Datian runs a grocery store in Kobe. Recently, Pan Liansheng, who opened a barber shop in Japan, and Xu Linshu, the manager of the money shop, retained lawyer Shi Qinghua to file a private lawsuit in the District Court against fraud and embezzlement. Because the crime took place abroad, according to Article 3 of the Criminal Code, it does not fall under the jurisdiction of this country. The court once ordered a suspension of the trial and awaited a further hearing by the court affairs meeting. Now, regarding the case of Xu Linshu suing Yang Weiren for embezzlement of over 6,000 yuan, the hearing has been rescheduled for the 21st of this month. Regarding the case of Pan Liansheng suing Jiang Datian and Yang Weiren for fraud under the pretext of doing gold business, Jiang Datian for defrauding 1,400 yuan, and Yang Weiren for defrauding 3,000 yuan, Judge Lu held a hearing. The defendants retained lawyer Xue Lisheng for defense. Regarding the issue of jurisdiction, lawyer Shi stated that although there are restrictions under Article 3 of the Criminal Code, this case involves bringing Japanese gold to Shanghai for sale. The crime occurred in Shanghai because this business was not conducted in Shanghai. Therefore, this country can accept it. The defendant stated that they were doing gold business, which was managed by Yu and Yang, and even they themselves were deceived. Litigation is currently underway in Ningbo. The court ordered the end of the debate, and the judgment will be announced on the 22nd.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Despicable Swindler - Cheats Luggage From the Poor - Lin Jinhuan and Gu Zhaolin are Victims - Wang Chunhua Seizes the Opportunity to Practice Deception <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Lin Jinhuan and Gu Zhaolin, former servants in a Westerner's household on Route Cayol in the Concession, have been unemployed for a long time and are living in dire straits. They sought jobs everywhere through acquaintances, but without success. Wang Chunhua, a man from Hankou known to them, learned of their plight and claimed that his uncle owned a rice shop in Hankou and needed a clerk and an experienced bookkeeper. In addition to providing room and board, they would be paid more than ten yuan per month. He could introduce them. Lin and Gu, in their desperation, readily agreed and arranged to be led by Wang to board a Yangtze River steamer at a certain port in Hongkou around 2 PM the day before yesterday to go to Hankou. At that time, Lin and Gu brought a rattan suitcase, two hand baskets, and a bedding roll, worth a total of sixty to seventy yuan. Because the third-class fare was expensive, Wang negotiated with a cook and a second cook, surnamed Yang, on the steamer to allow the three of them to stay in the kitchen (commonly known as "traveling on the yellow fish") for only six yuan and fifty cents. After the agreement was reached, Wang deposited the luggage in the kitchen, claiming that the ship would set sail late at night. He said he would go to a barber shop to get a haircut, while Lin and Gu went to a bathhouse to bathe. In this short period of time, Wang secretly returned to the steamer and told the two cooks that he needed to pawn part of the luggage to raise money for the fare because it was not enough. The two cooks believed him and allowed Wang to take it away. When Lin and Gu returned to the steamer in the evening, only two empty hand baskets remained. They waited until late at night without seeing Wang, and became alarmed. They rushed to the customs police station to report the incident. The police sent detective Wang Haiquan to board the steamer for investigation and to apprehend the swindler.</p>

<p>Yang Tianyu, the former Commissioner of Opium Suppression in Fujian, met He Wenying, a woman from Hefei, Anhui (now 22 years old), in September 1933 and had a relationship with her, agreeing to marry her. However, He had already been promised to someone else, so she dissolved her engagement with her fiancé. Later, she discovered that Yang already had a wife and had also taken a woman surnamed Lin as a concubine. He insisted on marrying Yang, leading to a dispute. He then retained a lawyer and filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, accusing Yang of seduction and abandonment, along with an accompanying civil lawsuit, demanding alimony of 23,400 yuan. As a result, He lost the case. Subsequently, a settlement was reached, with Yang paying He 15 yuan per month for living expenses. On July 5th of this year, He gave birth to a daughter. Because Yang did not provide for the child's upbringing, and even failed to pay the 15 yuan monthly living expenses as stipulated in the previous settlement, he has now retained lawyer Shi Jiutang and filed a lawsuit in the Special First District Court against Yang Tianyu for abandoning the child, requesting that he be punished under Article 294 of the Criminal Code, along with an accompanying civil lawsuit, demanding the payment of education and other expenses, totaling 9,300 yuan. Because Yang is currently in the capital, it is requested that the summons be sent to his brother, Yang Tianying, at No. 66 Tianjin Road for forwarding. The court approved the request and issued a summons, which was delivered to Yang Tianying, but Yang Tianying refused to accept it. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, when Judge Chuan Lin held the hearing in Criminal Division Eight, the defendant did not appear. Judge Chuan Lin then instructed the plaintiff to ascertain the defendant's correct address and report it, and the case was postponed for a rescheduled hearing.</p>

<p>Gu Bingzhang, the owner of the Chun Ji Leather Shoe Store on Hubei Road, had an argument with his wife, Song, on the 9th of last month, which escalated into violence, resulting in the injury of his wife. Because she was pregnant, her pregnancy was affected. She was treated at Guangren Hospital, which reported the incident to the Old Zhabei Police Station. Gu Bingzhang was charged with assault. After hearing the case, the Special First District Court ordered Gu to pay 500 yuan bail and await sentencing.

If he fails to pay the fine, he will be sentenced to community service, with 2 yuan equivalent to one day. He will remain on bail during the appeal period.</p>

<p>There are three Western League football matches today in the first division. Donghua plays Western Business at Shenyuan. After Sun Jia returned to the Donghua team, Xiao Heitan (Little Black Coal) has also joined, making his debut today. Western Business's main player, Huo Hua, has left Shanghai for Tianjin, significantly reducing their strength. Therefore, Donghua's victory is without a doubt. As for Jinan's match against Shell, Jinan's Chen Zhenxiang has recovered from his minor illness, and Wang Nanzhen has recovered from fatigue. Both will be playing today, making the lineup much more complete than last week. The other first division match is Portugal against Western Police. Given the Portuguese team's scattered lineup this season, they are unlikely to be a match for Western Police.</p>

<p>In yesterday's Western League football matches, the match between French Business and Lacrosse at Yiyuan was the most exciting. In the end, Lacrosse lost 7-5. Lancashire's match against Saint Francis, given Lancashire's strength last week, should have been an easy win for Lancashire. However, the result was a 1-1 draw. Lancashire has now one point less than French Business. Donghua will have one less strong competitor. As for yesterday's reserve team matches, Donghua only narrowly defeated Western Police 2-1, and Jinan defeated Western Business 6-1. The results of each group are as follows:</p>
<p>French Business Wins Lacrosse First Division 7-5</p>
<p>Lancashire Draws Saint Francis First Division 1-1</p>
<p>Donghua Wins Western Police Reserve 2-1</p>
<p>Jinan Wins Western Business Reserve 6-1</p>

<p>Results are not yet known.</p>
<p>Donghua Wins Western Police 2-1</p>
<p>Western Police attacked first, but were immediately besieged by Donghua. Wu Binghao's shot missed. Donghua was once in danger, but fortunately, Sun Baoqing defused the danger. Donghua repeatedly launched attacks. Although the ball was mostly at Donghua's feet, they gained nothing. The first half ended 0-0. After the break, Donghua's offensive was very strong. In the eighth minute, Wan Xianghua single-handedly went straight in, dribbled past Pei Daoke, and shot from 15 yards, scoring the first goal. Western Police desperately counterattacked. Bao Tai kicked the ball into the goal, making it 1-1. Less than a minute had passed since Donghua's goal. In the twelfth minute, Wan Xianghua received a pass from Sun Jinshun and advanced alongside Wu Binghao, scoring a goal, making it 2-1. Near the end, Donghua's Sun Jinshun took a penalty kick, which bounced out off Aite Menz, and the game ended 2-1.</p>

<p>Jinan and Western Business played yesterday at Jiaozhou Park. Western Business attacked first. Jinan was in a favorable position. In a moment, Wang Ma Zi Jing intercepted the ball and advanced through the middle. Huang Shihua feigned a move to the east and secretly passed to Zeng Rongzhong, who scored with one kick. Less than a minute had passed since the start of the game. Western Business counterattacked. In the fifth minute, the ball hovered on the left side of Jinan's goal. Hai Liesi secretly waited under the goal. Weifu passed the ball in, and Hai knocked it in, making it a tie. After that, Western Business declined, and Jinan controlled the situation. Wang Ma Zi Jing, Feng Xuegui, and Huang Shihua continuously scored three goals, ending the first half with a score of 4-1. After the break, Western Business became even more sluggish. Hui Rongzhong scored with a diagonal shot in the twentieth minute. Chen Pengze also received a pass from Zeng Zhi, cut across the goal, and scored, ending the game with a score of 6-1.

<p>First Division French Business Wins Over Lacrosse</p>
<p>French Business and Lacrosse are two of the strongest teams in the Shanghai football scene this season. Yesterday, they met at Yiyuan in an important match of the Western League's first division. Lacrosse was brave and good at fighting, while French Business was steady and cautious. The competition between the two teams was very fierce, and the battle was exciting and the performance exceptionally beautiful. Lacrosse was defeated by French Business due to its weaker defense and goalkeeper. The first half ended 1-2, and the overall result was 7-5, with French Business winning.</p>

<p>Warehouse yarn inventory only 9,000 bales remaining; October rises to $220, still cheaper than spot by $6-7.</p>
<p>The yarn market's upward trend has returned, as the spot yarn situation tightens, with factories reporting stockouts. As a result, warehouse yarn is extraordinarily sought after, with only about 9,000 bales remaining. Prices are rising steadily, and market sentiment is excited. Marked yarn has followed, rising accordingly. However, compared to spot market prices, it is still cheaper by $6-7. The October yarn contract closed at $220, finding a new five-year high, surpassing the July 13th forward yarn price of $219.80.</p>
<p>Da Feng and Others: Wholesale Purchasing</p>
<p>The marked yarn market opened, and recent months have seen spot yarn unusually scarce, with prices exceeding marked yarn by $7-8. Therefore, buyers flocked in, and the market remained firmly up by $1.00 to $1.20. Forward contracts experienced heavy selling pressure from a major player and securities firms, falling by $0.08-0.09. The second session was nearly flat with the previous one. At the close of the third session, reports indicated that spot yarn sales, while better than the previous day, still saw rising prices. Market sentiment was revitalized, and all months rebounded. Yuda, Hexing, Dachangcheng, and other large players sold heavily, while Dafeng, Gengfeng, Ruida, Shenji, Changfeng, and Dachang Xiecheng made wholesale purchases. As a result, near-term contracts rose by $1.30-$1.40 from the previous day's close, and forward contracts rose by $0.02-0.05. The afternoon session opened with a tight market, as yarn sales were lively and factories had no spot yarn to supply. Short sellers panicked, and prices jumped by $1.00. After the second session, they rose steadily. Hexing continued to sell heavily. As a result, all months rose by $1.20-$2.10 from the morning close. Sales were Hexing 13,900 bales, Deda 1,200 bales, Zhenda 1,500 bales, Dachangcheng 1,500 bales, Tongfu 1,300 bales, Changyu 1,300 bales, Renfeng 3,300 bales, Changfeng 1,650 bales, Dachang 1,050 bales, and Xincheng 3,400 bales. Purchases were Dafeng 1,950 bales, Gengfeng 5,150 bales, Jifeng 1,700 bales, Ruida 1,450 bales, Shenji 4,750 bales, Changfeng 4,500 bales, Xiecheng 2,550 bales, Dachang 1,850 bales, Shengyuan 2,000 bales, Yicheng 4,000 bales, Wang Taixing 1,300 bales, Hengyi 1,050 bales, and Tongji 1,100 bales. The day's high and low prices are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Yarn Rises Another $10</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales remain brisk. Statistics show that various groups bought a total of 1,695 bales throughout the day, with prices rising $3.00. Thread prices soared by $8.00-$10.00. The buying amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Tianjin 400, Inland 68, Yunnan 140</p>
<p>Peers 245, Shantou 30, Jiangxi 50</p>
<p>Guangdong 15, Luzhou 130</p>

<p>The cotton market is being pressured by concentrated buying from major players, and the market is increasingly weak. However, yarn sales are lively, and factory demand is high. Japanese merchants are making large purchases, so spot prices are quite high. In the afternoon, most people said that cotton prices in producing areas such as Zhengzhou were soaring by $1.00 per load, market sentiment was excited, and prices reached new highs. Judging from the overall situation, although there is heavy pressure at present, once there is a rebound, it will be difficult to contain.</p>
<p>Marked Cotton Rises Sharply by $0.03-0.04</p>
<p>In the opening of the marked cotton market, a major player again came in to put pressure, selling very heavily. Near-term contracts fell by $0.02-0.03. Near-term contracts were slightly better, recovering $0.005 after the second session, but the desks were a little quiet. However, forward contracts fell. By the close of the third session, reports indicated that the yarn market was firm, the U.S. and Indian cotton markets were rising together, and a certain industry organization had received news that cotton prices in the Zhengzhou producing area had soared by $1.00 per load. As a result, some buying interest suddenly intensified, and all months rose by $0.02-$0.035. Yuda, Gengfeng, Zhenda, Xingchang, Yuanxingchang, and Tongfeng sold heavily, while Jifeng, Dafu, Dafeng, Shenji, Yichang, Dachang, Hexing, and Changji bought. As a result, all months rose by $0.005-$0.025 from the previous day's close, and the current month fell by $0.015. The market situation changed rapidly in the afternoon session, as prices in all producing areas soared, market sentiment improved, and buying interest intensified. However, sellers continued to put pressure. As a result, all months rose by $0.025-$0.035 from the morning close. Sales were Yuda 20,600 loads, Zhenda 9,200 loads, Gengfeng 9,600 loads, Dachangcheng 5,800 loads, Hexing 8,600 loads, Yuanyi 4,700 loads, Shengyuan 3,900 loads, and Yongda 1,600 loads. Purchases were Xingchang 6,500 loads, Jifeng 4,400 loads, Yuanxingchang 5,700 loads, Dafeng 5,700 loads, Dianchang 5,100 loads, Senkang 6,100 loads, Shenji 6,700 loads, Dafu 6,300 loads, Yichang 3,800 loads, Dachang 3,100 loads, Mingde 2,900 loads, Changji 2,500 loads, Ruida 2,000 loads, and Changyu 2,000 loads. The day's high and low prices are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Factory Purchases Are Particularly Brisk</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is active. Japanese factories are importing enormous amounts, with sources reporting 2,100 bales of Yao cotton and 1,850 bales of Tong cotton.</p>

<h3 id="e180">American Cotton Merchants Actively Buy Spot <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened with all months up 1-4 points. Early in the morning, traders were hesitant, fearing that spot merchants would again sell as much as 95,000 bales as they did the previous day. Later, seeing that hedging sales were not as great as expected, traders, foreign firms, and brokers bought in, and the market returned to firmness. Before the close of foreign markets, demand was lackluster, but spot demand was very active. It is reported that cotton merchants are accumulating good quality spot cotton. Weather forecasts are good for the East Coast and Georgia, rain is expected in the Carolinas today, and conditions are generally good in the Midwest and West, but the certainty of Haiti's [cotton crop] is uncertain. Hester's estimates this week's factory consumption at 363,000 bales, and Liverpool's inventory at 237,000 bales. At the close, traders and short-covering players bought in, with spot up 4 points and futures up 4-11 points. English spot cotton was unchanged, and futures were up 1 point. Indian cotton saw short covering, and futures traders gradually bought in, but sellers did not flood in, resulting in few transactions. Fingal and Omlah rose 1.5 rupees, and Bai Luo Creek rose 1.75 rupees. Original telegraphs on the left (16th telegraph).</p>
<p>Fingal 159.75 Up 1.50 29.30</p>
<p>Omlah 199.75 1.50 39.80</p>
<p>Bai Nanxi 113.75 40.60</p>
<p>According to a telegraph from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 17th is Bai Luo Creek at 223 rupees, up 0.25 rupees, Omlah at 200 rupees, up 0.25 rupees, and Fingal at 160 rupees, up 0.25 rupees.</p>
<p>Local Cotton Inventory Increases Significantly - Survey of October 16th -</p>
<h3 id="e181">Piece Goods: Production of Fine Yarn Fabrics Declines Sharply; Various Piece Goods are Mostly Out of Stock; Prices are High, and Transactions Become Sluggish <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw increasingly tight conditions due to the current shortage of yarn and thread, and the marked yarn and cotton also rose sharply. As a result, the cloth market became more prosperous, the market soared, and market sentiment consolidated. Various groups of customers absorbed enthusiastically, especially those from Hankou, Nanchang, Anqing, Changsha, and local streets. Factories have large orders for goods such as broadcloth, line tweed, printed flannel, twill flannel, fine cloth, and fine twill, which have not yet been delivered on schedule. In view of the market's rapid rise, new transactions are unwilling to be accepted. Spot fine yarn is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain, and it is difficult to purchase even at high prices. As a result, the production of fine yarn fabrics has declined sharply due to raw material issues, and the market is increasingly panicked about the shortage of goods. Yesterday, white fine cloth, coarse cloth, fine twill, and coarse twill continued to rise ($0.02-$0.03 per piece), market cloth and 84 cloth rose ($0.01 per piece), and bleached cloth, blue cloth, colored twill, and shirting rose ($0.005 per piece). Broadcloth, straight tribute line tweed, printed flannel, and twill flannel rose by varying amounts of $0.03-$0.05 per piece. However, because nine out of ten brands of cloth are out of stock, the actual number of transactions is very small. Only forward raw cotton cloth, fine cloth, coarse cloth, and other goods saw local and foreign factories continue to release 500-600 pieces yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Food: Marked Flour Buyers Active at the Close - Mill Hedging Not Smooth - <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of yesterday's futures flour market in the morning, the market for all months presented an initial stable and then declining trend. As overseas wheat quotations improved by $0.01 in Chicago and about $0.02-$0.03 in Canada, prices were initially stable. Due to renewed rumors of unrest, most profit-taking bulls gradually returned to the mills, and there were also sales of forward contracts, leading to a gradual loosening of market sentiment and a decline of $0.01-$0.02 compared to the opening. After the opening in the afternoon, ups and downs were mixed. Initially, there was still some return from the bulls, which was relatively weak, but then mill hedging was not smooth, and buyers became active again, recovering close to the opening. It is currently the case that flour prices have opened at the highest record in history and have long since exceeded rice prices. If the government effectively stabilizes the market, it should not be difficult to loosen it a little.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Forward Wheat Transactions More Active - Full Day Results Back a Small $0.01-0.03/4 - <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of yesterday's futures wheat market in the morning, the market for all months presented an initial firm and then weak trend. As overseas wheat quotations improved by $0.01-$0.03, market sentiment was initially stable. However, the previous day's surge was purely driven by speculation by outsiders, and most people in the industry were dissatisfied. This is because wheat is ultimately a foodstuff and should not be over-inflated. Moreover, forward contracts are more influenced by market sentiment, so as soon as buyers stopped, the market gradually weakened. There were few transactions in near-term contracts, and the market saw little change. Forward contracts fell by varying amounts of $0.01/4. After the opening in the afternoon, transactions were very active. Bulls continued to absorb forward contracts, but sellers were also very enthusiastic. As a result, the outcome was roughly the same as in the morning. Spot wheat prices were similar to the previous day. The highest price opened at $5.80, then $5.75, and then around $5.00. Fuxin purchased 13,000 bags, Fufeng purchased 5,000 bags, and Shenda purchased 4,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Rice and Grain Sales Particularly Clear Yesterday <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Although only Nos. 27 and 28 arrived from various groups yesterday, totaling 5,500-5,600 dan, local sales were particularly sluggish. The Qingdao and Longkou groups also purchased only about 1,000 bags of kiln-seed rice. As a result, the market was quiet, and the market continued to decline. As a result, Ruohouxin粳 price fell by $0.001, the new thin rice market repaired by $0.005, Dujian followed down by a few cents, Yangjian supply and demand were similar, the market was flat, Houbo broken grain saw limited sales, and the price also fell by a small $0.001-$0.002. The new Yin Yuan goods lacked the fragrance of rice, and the market was quite brisk.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the river-down goods source was Nos. 33 and 34. On the market, the various rice sales of new粳 and broken粳 still did not improve. Various Jians were still good, kiln-seed goods were scarce and quite brisk, and new and old Bian Yuan were also in demand. The market new粳 high goods were sluggish by a few cents, medium and lower goods were close to a dime lower, broken粳 was sluggish by $0.003-0.004, new and old Bian Yuan price increased by $0.001, kiln-seed was stable, and the price of Yang Dufu glazed pottery was still flat and stable, and customer Jians tightened a bit.</p>
<p>(Customer Indican) Arrival was more, sales were thin, and the situation continued to weaken. Arrival volume was high because there was still a lot of goods in transit, with 6,000 to 12,000 bags still arriving every day. Yesterday, customer sales were even more sluggish. The Cantonese group only purchased 210 bags of rice bran. The local street and Quanzhou-Xiamen groups inquired about mechanical rice, but only 2,000 bags were slightly odd. Digestion was sluggish, and the market was softer. Although the market only fell by a small $0.005-$0.006, market sentiment was weak. The reason is that in recent days, daily digestion has still been above 10,000 to 20,000 bags, or at least 5,000 to 6,000 bags. The low volume of transactions yesterday was really a first in recent days. The total Jiangbei rice traded was 100 bags, and the Jiangxi rice was 1,910 bags.</p>

<p>The gold market was quite stable yesterday, and as a result, it continued to rise by $0.009. However, major players both took profits and closed positions, causing fluctuations mid-session. The general trend meandered as a result. In the early morning, the overseas silver market saw English shrink and U.S. flat. The Manderley forward silver price shrank by $0.0005-$0.00025. Exchange rates shrank slightly. London raw gold was unchanged. The Central Bank's listing of rates revealed that English and American rates were flat, and the customs gold unit was unchanged.

<h3 id="e186">Settlement of Swap Positions: Forward Exchange Rates Still Struggle <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw a settlement of swap positions, with near-term rates remaining relatively flat and far-term rates slightly easing. The trading process throughout the day was sluggish. Early morning overseas reports indicated that in London, both near-term and far-term large contracts decreased by 0.0625. The New York silver market was inactive. Monteray's far-term silver prices decreased by amounts ranging from five to two and a half cents. London gold prices were unchanged. British pounds against US dollars decreased by 0.025, while British pounds against French francs were unchanged. US dollars against British pounds decreased by 0.025, and US dollars against French francs were unchanged. The Central Bank announced its official rates, with both British and US dollars remaining stable. Customs gold unit rates were unchanged. The foreign exchange market opened with near-term selling prices of British pounds at one shilling, two and seventy-four thirty-fifths of a penny, and US dollars at twenty and a half yuan. Compared to the previous close, the fluctuations in both British and US dollar rates were minimal. After the opening, the supply from banks exceeded demand, leading to a slight easing of rates. HSBC announced its official rates, with British pounds increasing by 0.03125, while the pound exchange rate remained stable. During this period, there was active trading and currency swaps. The silver equalization tax was announced, decreasing by half a cent. Although the Central Bank accepted shillings, the far-term rates still struggled to gain traction. The process mostly involved sideways movement. At the noon close, near-term selling prices were British pounds at one shilling, two and seventy-four thirty-sevenths of a penny and a half-penny in tandem, and US dollars at twenty-nine and a half yuan. Compared to the previous close, both British and US dollars remained flat. In terms of swap settlements, far-term rates saw British pounds easing by 0.03115 and US dollars easing by 0.0625. There was minimal activity from Chinese merchants. Banks engaged in both buying and selling. Currently, Chinese merchants still largely hold long positions, making it difficult for the trend to gain momentum. The recorded transactions for today are listed below:</p>
<p>British Pounds: Opened with near-term selling price at one shilling, two and seventy-four thirty-sevenths of a penny. Mercantile sold October contracts at 46875 to the East Asia Bank. Citibank bought January contracts at 375 (this was a swap transaction with the Central Bank for British pound exchange rates at one shilling, two and sixty-four sixty-fourths of a penny). Mercantile sold December contracts at 4375. Citibank sold January contracts at 375 to Mercantile. Mercantile sold December contracts at 40625 to HSBC. Landale sold October contracts at 46875 to China.

<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market initially weakened but later strengthened. Large investors remained scarce, and even minor large-scale transactions could trigger fluctuations. The overall environment remained unchanged, and investor confidence remained uncertain. Throughout the day, selling pressure was heavy at the opening, with notable selling of No. 47 and some selling of No. 11, causing prices to decline uniformly, ranging from small fractions of a cent to half a cent. The second session saw some confusion, initially weak but then strengthening, with significant buying of No. 10. In the afternoon, the situation reversed again, with retail investors showing renewed demand, leading to increased buying pressure and a uniform price rebound of one-fifth of a cent to four cents. The closing trend remained strong, with continued buying of No. 5 and No. 35. However, Nos. 6 and 45, both types A and B, suddenly saw large-scale selling, causing prices to weaken suddenly, declining by small fractions of a cent to two and a half cents. As a result, except for Type B this month, which performed well by gaining a cent, all other types declined by small fractions of a cent to four cents. The total trading volume was 8 million yuan. The resulting gains and losses are compared in the table below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Hainan Longans: Previously, due to limited sales channels, quoted prices had fallen by two to three yuan, leading to resistance from both traders and brokers, resulting in few transactions. Recently, market activity gradually increased. The initial price was 42 yuan, which then rose to 43 yuan. Yesterday, the price increased by another yuan, reaching 44 yuan. However, ordinary quality dried longans and Xiamen longans saw producers actively buying in the producing areas, leading to a decrease in shipments to Shanghai and a recent rebound in prices. The market may see further tightening.</p>
<p>Xuzhou Melon Seeds: Yesterday, the grain traders offered 100 bags of melon seeds. The quality was average, with a transaction price of 19.7 yuan, nearly a yuan higher than when the market was weak. It is reported that inventory in Shanghai is also low, and production inventory is extremely scarce. If the situation remains stable, the market could rebound.</p>

<p>New crop peanuts from Xuzhou have been arriving continuously in recent days. Scattered transactions were priced at 10 yuan, mostly purchased by local traders. However, due to the inferior quality of the new crop, the offered prices tend to weaken. The market is watching for prices above 10 yuan after customs clearance, but considering the cost in Xuzhou, there will be losses. If the later crops are of higher quality, there may be an opportunity.</p>

<p>According to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, tea exports in September totaled 24,360 piculs, comprising 16,339 piculs of green tea, 4,969 piculs of black tea, and 3,52 piculs of other teas. Of this, 3,622 piculs were exported to the United States, 3,108 piculs to the United Kingdom, 1,188 piculs to India, 1,746 piculs to Hong Kong, 11,258 piculs to Africa (including Morocco, Algeria, Tripoli, and other regions), and 3,438 piculs to other countries. The total volume for this month decreased by 12,831 piculs compared to the previous month and by 2,277 piculs compared to the same month last year, indicating that the tea market is gradually entering a slow season starting this month. However, the total volume from January this year exceeds that of the same period last year by over 1,700 piculs, which, though a small amount, is sufficient to indicate that China's tea trade has shown initial signs of development. The tea export statistics for September are attached below (unit: picul).</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Yokohama market was closed, while New York silk prices rebounded. Near-term contracts increased by three cents, and far-term contracts increased by three and a half cents, leading to brisk sales in the Shanghai silk market. US merchant white filature B grade 7-8 evenness 20-22 denier grades were the most popular. The market price rose by five yuan compared to the previous day. Foreign silk merchants sold 350 bales, with some silk transactions pending based on Yokohama silk prices next Monday. However, sentiment in the Shanghai market has turned more optimistic. Manufacturers are holding firm on prices, leading to users being unable to follow the market and resulting in no transactions yesterday. Nevertheless, the recent fluctuations in New York silk prices have stimulated the Shanghai silk market, and foreign sales may see slight activity.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Observations on Japanese and American Silk Markets: Apparent Significant Increase in US Hosiery Consumption; Rumors of Japan Organizing Large-Scale Raw Silk Company <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Although recent transactions in New York raw silk have not been brisk, US hosiery manufacturers have been actively purchasing. Recently, 20-22 denier raw silk has been in short supply, while there is reluctance to purchase futures, mainly due to Italy shipping 20,000 to 25,000 bales of raw silk to the US in this season (July 1936 - June 1937). It is reported that a small amount has already been delivered to factories for use. The buyers are mostly warp knitting mills, and the sales of silk fabrics are currently brisk, leading to strong futures prices, but this is mainly driven by speculation. The rayon trade is also active. As for the supply and demand issues in the US market this season, estimations based on the current situation are as follows, making it easier to predict future price trends:</p>
<p>Japan's silk production capacity: 440,000 bales (decrease of 25,000 bales compared to last season) + 20,000 bales (released from government's last season's inventory)</p>
<p>Japan's total: 460,000 bales + 101,000 bales (increase of 20,000 bales compared to last year) + 21,000 bales (Italian export volume)</p>
<p>Total: 581,000 bales - 110,000 bales (for European consumption) = 471,000 bales (available for US consumption)</p>
<p>Based on the above estimate, the consumption volume for the 12-month season is 472,000 bales, which is not a significant increase compared to the previous season's consumption of 456,000 bales. Furthermore, the first four months of the last season, which saw extremely strong consumption, were not as robust as this season. The consumption volumes for July, August, and September this season were 36,658 bales, 42,016 bales, and 45,709 bales, respectively, with an estimated 45,000 bales for October, totaling 169,383 bales in these four months. Subtracting 169,383 bales from 472,000 bales leaves 302,000 bales, which can supply US consumption for eight months. Based on the above estimate, if accurate, the average monthly consumption would be 38,000 bales. In previous years, this number would have been considered insufficient, but the average monthly consumption during the same period last year was only 34,700 bales, so careful consideration is necessary. Furthermore, compared to 34,700 bales, there would be a surplus of 3,300 bales per month, totaling 26,400 bales in eight months. Although the above estimates are predictions, they are likely not exaggerated. The increase in production in both Italy and China this year is expected, and the consumption volume in Europe and the US is not expected to deviate significantly. The only difference lies in the increase or decrease in US consumption. The US hosiery industry's consumption has increased compared to the previous season, which is very clear. It is expected that the silk market will become more active in the next eight months, so prices are not expected to decline significantly. However, there is also a disturbing piece of news that may pose some potential risks to the future of the silk market, namely, Japan's Seiyukai party plans to establish a large-scale Japanese raw silk company. There is much speculation about this rumor, but the consensus is that the intention is to dominate the Japanese silk export industry. If this organization is established, the existing exporters will inevitably be forced to dissolve, and the future silk market may become unstable.</p>
<h3 id="e193">September Raw Silk Export Statistics <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>According to the report from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, raw silk exports in September totaled 4,486 bales, comprising 3,580 bales of white filature, 85 bales of yellow filature, 144 bales of Tussah silk, 71 bales of white douppion, 22 bales of yellow silk fabric, 306 bales of yellow douppion, 153 bales of grey silk, and 181 bales of dupion silk. Of this, 371 bales were exported to Africa, 2,040 bales to the Americas, 272 bales to Asia, and 1,799 bales to Europe. Since the new silk season began, the total raw silk exports up to September totaled 13,998 bales, a sharp decrease of 30,621 bales compared to 24,619 bales in the same period last year. The sluggish foreign sales and weak market conditions in recent months have resulted in a sharp decline in export figures.</p>

<p>— Yang Chunlu</p>
<p>It has been over a month since school started. Children are once again finding happy lives in the schoolyard. But you must remember the saying "Be careful in starting your studies." At the beginning of this semester, you should put in more effort, explore deeply, and study carefully. Sweet fruits are waiting for you to taste.</p>
<p>Children! Don't think that the semester has just started, and there is plenty of time in the future, and there will be many days to study hard! You must know that time flies, and a semester will pass in the blink of an eye. We can only seize the present and work hard in time to get a satisfactory start.</p>
<p>Children who have participated in races will surely remember that in 50-meter or 100-meter races, when the gun sounds, if you don't immediately start running and rush forward, you will fall behind. Studying is the same. You must have a good start to have good results!</p>
<p>Children! It's time. Work hard! Strive! A satisfactory victory will surely belong to you!</p>
<h3 id="e195">Teeth <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>In recent days, Min'er has been suffering from toothache, making it inconvenient to eat and talk, causing him great suffering. He wondered why the toothache happened so that he could prevent it later.</p>
<p>"Brother, toothache is more uncomfortable than any other disease. Why does it happen?"</p>
<p>"This is because food is stuck in the gaps of the teeth for a long time, causing it to rot and turn sour, gradually peeling off the enamel and dentin, and affecting the nerves, which causes toothache."</p>
<p>"What is enamel? What is dentin?"</p>
<p>"I have to briefly explain the composition of teeth to you: Our teeth are divided into incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. The composition of the teeth: (1) The part of the tooth that is exposed outside the gums and can be seen is called the crown. The crown is made of enamel, which is as hard as stone and forms the outer layer of the tooth. Enamel is the hardest part of the human body. (2) The part of the tooth that is embedded in the jawbone by the gums is called the root. Incisors and canines have only one root, while molars have two or three roots. The root is composed of dentin. In the middle of the dentin is a pulp cavity, which is full of blood vessels and nerves."</p>
<p>"The shape of the teeth is different, so they are divided into the incisors, canines, premolars, and molars that I just told you about. Incisors are like small chisels, so they can bite off food. Canines are conical and can crush hard food. Premolars and molars are both mortar-shaped and can grind food further."</p>
<p>"How many teeth do we have? Are the teeth of young children the same as ours?"</p>
<p>"I have about thirty-two teeth, because I am an adult. There are about eight incisors, four canines, eight premolars, and twelve molars. Your teeth do not have a definite number, because you are not yet an adult. The teeth of young children have only twenty, ten in the upper jaw and ten in the lower jaw. However, the teeth that come out in childhood are called baby teeth. When they are about seven years old, the baby teeth will fall out one after another, and new teeth will grow in successively. By the time they are about twelve years old, the baby teeth will be completely replaced. These newly grown teeth are everyone's permanent teeth, so we must protect them well."</p>
<h3 id="e196">Make a Beautiful and Lively Goldfish <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yun</p>
<p>A goldfish seller came outside the door, prompting Xin'er to force his father to buy one. Dad nodded, thought for a while, and said happily:</p>
<p>"Xin, if we buy a few of these goldfish and raise them in a fish tank, it may be difficult for them to survive for long. Now I have a beautiful, lively, and never-dying goldfish. Would you like to have it? But you have to use your hands."</p>
<p>"Yes, I am willing to do anything to get a goldfish."</p>
<p>So Dad began to tell him how to use his hands and how to get a beautiful and lively goldfish:</p>
<p>Take an egg and use a knife to open a small hole at each end, so that the yolk and white inside can flow out together. Then use drawing paper to cut out a fish tail. Separately use a thread, one end tied to the base of the fish tail, and the other end passed through the larger hole of the eggshell and out of the smaller hole. Then make a knot slightly larger than the small hole; in this way, the goldfish's body shell is made.</p>
<p>The second part of the work: Apply red paint on its body shell. After it is dry, use an ink brush to draw the surface of the fish. At that time, you can inject half of the sand and mud inside the eggshell into the small hole at the base of the fish tail to maintain stability when it is put into water. Then you can use melted wax to seal the small holes on both the large and small ends of the egg. In this way, the goldfish is already made. (See the picture)</p>
<p>When playing: Use some soap to stick under the base of the fish tail. Put the goldfish in a water basin. By the power of the soap, the goldfish can slowly swim forward; at the same time, the fish tail can also slowly sway. It looks like a beautiful and lively goldfish is looking for its companions!</p>
<p>Xin'er followed his father's instructions, prepared all the materials, and started to make it. Sure enough, now he has a beautiful, lively, and never-dying goldfish.</p>

<p>Science Questions</p>
<h3 id="e198">Why can ships sail in water? Why can airplanes move forward in the air? <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Maode</p>
<p>Children! You always have a feeling, why can ships sail in water? Why can airplanes move forward in the air? What is the principle behind this? Perhaps few of you children know the reason, so let me give a simple explanation:</p>
<p>People do not have automatic ability, that is, people must be directed by others. In other words, people's actions are passive rather than active. Newton told us in the first law: "All objects, if not acted upon by an external force, will remain at rest forever, and objects in motion will continue to move at a constant speed forever. This relationship is also called the law of inertia." Therefore, because objects have inertia, an external force must be applied to make them move:</p>
<p>If a person pushes an object with force, because the object has inertia, it seems that the object has the force to push back, and its force is equal to the force used by the person. Therefore, ships can sail in water and airplanes can move forward in the air by using this reaction force. When a ship is in the water, it is propelled by oars rowing the water, which creates a reaction force that makes the ship move forward. Steamships use propellers, which consist of two or more metal plates mounted around a shaft. The engine causes the propeller to rotate, pushing water or air backward, and the reaction force of the body propels the propeller forward, moving in the direction of the rotating shaft, thus pushing the ship forward. Airplanes also use propellers. When the propeller rotates, it pushes air backward, causing the airplane to move forward; at the same time, the resistance under the wings is the pressure of the wind. Furthermore, the tail has two rudders, one is a horizontal rudder, which controls the ascent and descent of the body, and one is a vertical rudder, which controls the direction of the body's left and right movement. This is how airplanes fly.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Returning from the National Boy Scout Grand Review <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Xiong Feng</p>
<p>Our hope has finally been realized. The Second National Boy Scout Grand Review and Jamboree, which had been postponed so many times, finally showed its magnificent appearance in our capital on Double Ten Day.</p>
<p>What left the deepest impression on our minds at this conference was the spirit of President Chiang, what excited us the most was the air defense performance, what made us feel the greatest was the united strength of our Boy Scout, and what interested us the most was the construction of the campsite.</p>
<p>On the first day, I ran to the headquarters and saw a picture of President Chiang commanding the Boy Scouts on horseback erected in front of the door. This great picture made us feel excited. On the second day, the President flew to the campsite in an airplane at low altitude to welcome us. The sound of welcome rose from all sides. Later, we learned that the President had just arrived in Beijing from Jiangxi and took the opportunity to inspect the campsite. When the campsite movie was playing, the first one was to wish him a long life, which told us about President Chiang's great achievements. His heroic spirit was deeply imprinted in our minds. When we got up the next morning, the first thought that came to mind was President Chiang's heroic demeanor! On the day of the review, he wore a uniform adorned with gold stripes, showing his special majesty. When he walked past us, if it were not for the solemn review ceremony, I would have cheered madly.</p>
<p>More than 10,000 representatives of Boy Scouts from all over the country gathered in our capital, which shows that we are united and ready to serve the country. We camped together, played together, participated in labor service, and held campfire rallies and lantern parades. In particular, the representatives from the four northeastern provinces also participated in our team, which further stirred our enthusiastic emotions. Young people have active minds, passionate blood, enterprising spirit, and vigorous vitality. Everyone says that young people are the new cells of the country and the new bloodline of the nation. This grand gathering shows a new force for the revival of our country.</p>
<p>The construction of the campsite interested us the most. The sundial in the center of the campsite, the artificial thermometer, and the weather report flags were all very new designs. The layout of the campsites in each unit was even more novel and magnificent. Some places looked like a small garden, while others looked like an arsenal. I believe that the representatives who participated in this conference must have gained a lot of experience and knowledge about the layout of the campsite.</p>
<p>Now many new friends we have made will soon be separated. I hope that the third conference will be held in the near future. Some people say that the third conference will be held in Liaoning. We hope that this statement can be realized.</p>

<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>I took a long piece of burnt thread, tied one end to the top of an object, and the other end to a small toy, such as a tumbler, or four or five coins. When it is suspended in the air, use fire to burn it. Although the thread turns to ash, it does not break, and the object is still suspended in the air and does not fall off. This is a very interesting little game.</p>
<p>The method is to soak a two- or three-foot-long cotton thread in salt water overnight, then take it out and dry it. Then, use egg white to apply it to the thread. After it is dry, you can use it to play. The strangest thing is that when the thread turns to ash, we can slightly touch it with our fingers. At this time, the thread has actually turned into ashes, but it can still hang objects without breaking when playing. This is very magical. Children, why not try this simple and easy-to-make game in your spare time?</p>

<p>— Zhou Rubo, Shanghai Municipal Songxue Elementary School</p>
<p>Autumn has arrived, and our traveling team will soon be active again!</p>
<p>Last night, we prepared everything; today we bid farewell to our parents and all our relatives and friends, and set off on a journey to the southeast. We are riding on Mr. Wind's ship. At first, we arrived at China's largest commercial port - Shanghai. When I passed through Shanghai, I was very scared. Originally, the Whampoa River was full of foreign warships. Their soldiers were wearing new-style military uniforms, and all the new-style weapons were in their hands, which made me dare not stay. We then went to a lively place to travel. This trip scared me even more. Because when we passed that place, only those blue-eyed, blond-haired foreigners were building forts, piling sandbags, and digging trenches. We did not know what the reason was: why would foreigners live in China? Finally, I realized: it turned out to be a concession. I was scared and dared not stay, so I looked for a quieter place to go. Finally, I found a peaceful place to live, in the garden of a sincere and simple farmer. There was nothing in this garden that would harm me, and it was quiet and refreshing. So I settled down, and I will live here permanently, as my base, to maintain my life and raise my future generations.</p>

<p>They continued searching day after day, but the couple remained untraced. The neighbors put aside their own work and patiently cleared away the snow piled up on the mountain paths around Lantai day after day. However, after four or five days, they were still nowhere to be found. Finally, they used many dogs to lead the searchers to distant places beyond the mountain paths. Suddenly, a loud shout rang out from the top of a jagged cliff, and they knew that the lost couple had been found. Shanlan Ge Lin was lying stiffly there, covered in her husband's coat, having obviously died long ago. George Ge Lin's body was found at the bottom of a rock, and judging by his hunched posture, it was clear that he had fallen from the mountain and died instantly. The neighbors surmised that the couple must have been lost in the heavy snow and fog that night, and thus walked further and further until they reached the dark, jagged cliff. George Ge Lin had taken a few steps forward, trying to see if there was a path ahead, but he accidentally stepped off the edge of the cliff and fell. Shanlan probably didn't know what had happened and was still standing in place, desperately calling out to her husband, but in the deep snow of that night, no one in Lantai could have heard her. When she became hoarse and exhausted and could no longer move, she lay there waiting for her husband and eventually froze to death. According to those familiar with the couple, the pitiful Shanlan must have been worried about the many children at home at that time, and her anxiety urged her husband to hurry back, which caused him to lose his composure. If he had been alone, this disaster would never have happened. The brave little Anne Ge Lin stayed at home to take care of her six younger siblings, calmly waiting for her parents to return. In the end, she hesitated and then went out alone in the snow to look for them. This clearly demonstrated the military heritage she inherited from her father, and it was truly remarkable. The British poet William Wordsworth's sister, Dorothy, visited little Anne Ge Lin and listened to her recount everything that had happened, considering it to be a very precious story.</p>
<p>In a lovely spring, the Ge Lin couple was buried in the St. Swale cemetery in Cockermouth. William Wordsworth wrote a poem in their memory. After the funeral, the neighboring farmers all volunteered to adopt the seven orphans as their godchildren. The twin girls remained together, and the Gansling family adopted them. Little Anne Ge Lin, although separated from her siblings, wanted to live comfortably with her parents' friends. People near and far heard about this story and donated money, sending it in droves. Queen Charlotte and her princesses were also moved by little Anne Ge Lin's bravery and bestowed a generous sum of money as consolation, which was distributed to the orphans. People everywhere followed suit, and money came flying in like snowflakes. However, Dorothy Wordsworth refused it all because she thought that if the orphans received too much money, they would lose their ambition when they grew up, which would greatly affect their future.</p>

<h3 id="e204">"Establishment of Liaison Between Chinese and Japanese Newspapers" <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Liang Boxun</p>
<p>Since the newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai published common opinions and beliefs amidst the tense Sino-Japanese relations, and warned the people of the whole country and the Japanese government and the public, the press circles in various places have responded one after another, which shows that the people of our country have the same feelings about the current Sino-Japanese problem. On the Japanese side, at this time of tense Sino-Japanese relations, there are also remarks that are worth our attention. This is the text recently published by Mr. Ishibashi Tanzan, the chief writer of the "Toyo Keizai Shimpo": "Hope for the Establishment of Liaison Between the Press Circles to Adjust Sino-Japanese Relations" (the general idea of ​​the article is published in the "Shen Bao" on October 13). In this article, Mr. Ishibashi criticized the Japanese newspapers for turning a deaf ear to the joint telegram issued by the newspapers in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong-Hankou; and pointed out that "Japanese newspapers are good at destroying the relationship between Japan and foreign countries, and have no intention of maintaining international relations; Japanese newspapers now hold extreme patriotism, and have almost become a diplomatic organ of bureaucratic politics." Regarding the future of Sino-Japanese negotiations, he also expressed deep concern, saying that "if Japan's negotiation strategy proves to be clumsy, the danger of the Twenty-One Demands will almost be re-enacted, and Japan's misfortune will be even greater than China's! He also said that Foreign Minister Arita's declaration on September 28 "is clear in blaming others, but ignorant of blaming oneself." If this kind of comment is spoken by the people of our country, it may be pointed out as a manifestation of "anti-Japanese thinking," but now the person who made this statement is Mr. Ishibashi, a famous figure in the Japanese press, I wonder what the people of "friendly countries" will say about this. At the same time, Mr. Ishibashi sincerely hopes in this article that the newspapers of the two countries will establish understanding, "on the one hand, Chinese newspapers will not publish anti-Japanese news, and on the other hand, Japanese newspapers will not make malicious criticisms of China, and believe that if the newspapers of the two countries establish a liaison, it can promote the improvement of relations between the two countries." If this kind of hope can become a reality, of course, it is also what we are happy to hear. However, based on past facts and the current situation, we still have a few opinions to put forward for discussion here.</p>
<p>First, I don’t know what the so-called "anti-Japanese news" refers to. If it is said that Chinese newspapers publish news about a certain country's invasion of our land, publish the patriotic actions of our people, and express opinions on protecting the integrity of our country's territory and sovereignty, that is to exclude a certain country, then it is no different from prohibiting Chinese newspapers and Chinese people from loving China. We can never accept that. Naturally, the so-called "extreme patriotism," patriotism that invades neighboring countries to enrich oneself, has always been despised by Chinese newspapers and Chinese people, but the independence of the Chinese nation and the sovereignty of the country must be unanimously supported; if a country carries out the plundering of our country's territory and rights, and wants to force our entire people to be dominated by it, then our 400 million compatriots will surely hate it, hate it, and fight it to the end! This kind of performance of fighting for national independence and the spirit of fighting for the integrity of national territory and administration should be praised by the whole world and absolutely preserved by our people. If a strong neighbor is embracing "extreme patriotism" and infringing on our country's sovereignty, and wants us to abandon this great spirit of fighting for national independence, is it not a strange thing!</p>
<p>Second, if Chinese newspapers really publish the so-called "anti-Japanese news," then we should ask the Japanese people and general enlightened people such as Mr. Ishibashi to pay attention to the source of this so-called "anti-Japanese news." The Chinese nation is not a nation that makes a career of invading others, and absolutely does not want to exclude foreigners "anti-Japanese" for no reason. If we want to regard the Chinese people's upright and aboveboard patriotic movement as "anti-Japanese" behavior and regard it as an obstacle to improving relations between China and Japan, then the Japanese people and the general enlightened people should consider whether the Japanese government and soldiers have actions that infringe on the integrity of China's territory and administration, and whether they really use the "principle of equality" to adjust the relations between the two countries. If the factual answer is a "yes" and a "no," then the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations and the disharmony of the feelings of the two major nations of China and Japan are all the responsibility of Japan; and the Japanese people and the general enlightened people, if they want to improve Sino-Japanese relations, they should also find ways to correct the attitude of the Japanese military and political authorities towards China.</p>
<p>Third, we are not in a position to comment on Japanese newspapers. However, if what Mr. Ishibashi said is all true, that is, Japanese newspapers are "holding extreme patriotism," "good at destroying the relationship between Japan and foreign countries," and "diplomatic organs of bureaucratic politics," then if we want to "establish a liaison between Chinese and Japanese newspapers," we should first pay attention to the attitude of Japanese newspapers. If Japanese newspapers are always as Mr. Ishibashi commented, then there will never be a possibility of "establishing a liaison" between Chinese and Japanese newspapers. Because the people and newspapers of our country have always held an attitude of loving themselves without infringing on others, and treat the countries that treat me with equality with sincerity, equality, and peace. This has been fully demonstrated in past and present facts; if we let such people and newspapers "establish a liaison" with the kind of newspapers that Mr. Ishibashi commented on, is it possible in reality?</p>
<p>In short, the Chinese nation is a nation that does not invade others. The Chinese people love their own country and themselves, and also love peace and freedom. If Japan can treat China equally, without harming the integrity of China's territory and administration, without aggression, and keep its promises, then we will surely be able to treat it equally and jointly maintain peace in East Asia. If Japanese newspapers can abandon the attitude that Mr. Ishibashi commented on, and can truly work hard to improve Sino-Japanese relations based on the "principle of equality," then Chinese newspapers will naturally cooperate with it and "establish a liaison." At present, the Chinese people have fully awakened and realized that the country and the nation are at the final juncture of life and death. Unless all levels unite to resist foreign aggression, it will not be enough to seek survival. Under this situation, if Japan takes an oppressive and threatening posture to deal with the Chinese people, it will inevitably be unbearable for our 400 million compatriots, and the result will inevitably be a fundamental destruction of peace in the Far East, leading to the tragedy of mutual slaughter between the two major nations of East Asia, and even causing a world war. This may not be a blessing for China, but for Japan's misfortune, as Mr. Ishibashi said, I am afraid it "will be even worse than China's!"</p>

<p>"Puppet" is a political satire film worth watching, and almost everyone knows this. We have seen quite a few satire films, but this is the first one to take the entire world political stage as the subject matter, especially since it has a considerable relationship with us, such as restoration, nation-building, war... we can all see the puppeteers behind these "Puppets".</p>
<p>The Shanghai Grand Theatre is re-staging this film again. In this autumn of international troubles, we should have a different taste when we watch it. This morning, "Qitianle"—a Soviet comedy film—will be added to popularize it, and the price of seats will be reduced.</p>

<h3 id="e206">The Solemn and Splendid Papal Palace <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Min</p>
<p>Rome, Italy</p>
<p>The Vatican is one of the three major buildings in Rome and is the palace where the Roman Pope resides. It is located at the western end of Rome, occupying an area of about 450,000 square meters. In 1929, Italy and the Pope concluded a treaty in Rome and established Vatican City. In this city, the Pope has his own political sovereignty, and all the hundreds of citizens in the city are under the jurisdiction of the Pope and have nothing to do with the administration of Rome, although this place is in Rome. At the same time, the Pope has also sent ambassadors to Western European countries and South America; when any festivals arrive, many European and American countries will specially entertain his envoys.</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, we did not have an audience with the Pope, so we cannot talk about his demeanor and appearance here; what we want to say is the solemnity of the Vatican's architecture and all its ancient monuments and scenic spots, because although these are all manifestations of religious consciousness, they also have great cultural significance.</p>
<p>The so-called Vatican means the palace of the king of law, the government of the king of law. Included in Vatican City are St. Peter's Basilica, the Papal Palace, museums, libraries, chapels, gardens, etc. When we go to the Vatican in Rome, as soon as we get off the tram, what appears in front of us is an oval square surrounded by neat and beautiful corridors. Standing on the roof of the corridor are one hundred and sixty-three statues of saints, which are particularly eye-catching. As for the size of the oval square, the long diameter is 340 meters and the short diameter is 240 meters; it spreads out broadly on the ground, like a fishing net, swallowing visitors one by one. It is said that this square was designed by Bernini, a representative writer of the Italian Baroque in the 17th century. In the center of the square stands an obelisk transported from Egypt; to its left and right are two clear springs that spray white smoke into the South European sky.</p>
<p>On the front of the square is St. Peter's Basilica. This temple covers an area of 15,160 square meters and was completed over a long period of time from the mid-15th century to the end of the 17th century. The solemnity and greatness of its architecture can be imagined. Those who visit this temple, standing in the square, will of course first see its dome-like round roof. There is a large cross on the roof, which makes every Christian look up with reverence. It is said that this round roof was designed by Michelangelo, a great artist of the Renaissance period, in his later years. It can be said to be a noble artistic treasure. Walking into the temple and looking up at the inside of the round roof, you can immediately see the statues of Christ, St. Mary, and the ambassadors. Inside the entire temple, there are countless artistic treasures, which can be said to be an art treasure house of the Renaissance and Baroque periods. For example, Michelangelo's marble sculpture "Pieta," made in 1498, is a representative work of art of the Renaissance period; Bernini's bronze canopy (29 meters high) decorated on the high altar is also a representative of the Baroque of the 17th century, and there are many other valuable works of art that cannot be listed one by one.</p>
<p>Leaving St. Peter's Basilica, walking around the back from his left to the right, is the rectangular museum. As soon as you pass through the gate where this museum connects to the temple, the first thing you will see is the ancient-style guards, which will make people feel like they are leaving reality. The museum is not very simple. It includes corridors, chapels, and many buildings related to the Papal Palace. The Papal Palace here was moved from southern France by Pope Gregory XI in 1377, and later generations of popes added and renovated this palace to make it what it is today.</p>
<p>The walls and roofs of every house in the Vatican have been decorated by the masters of the painting world during the Renaissance. If you want to view all these paintings, it will take at least a day. Now, let us mention a few of the most valuable works of art among them.</p>
<p>First of all, what deserves special mention is the artistic heritage that the painting saint Raphael left us here. At the beginning of the 16th century, it was the era of Pope Julius II, the protector of art, and his court was the center of the highest culture at that time. Raphael was only twenty-nine years old at this time, and had not yet become famous. He originally lived in Florence, and only went to Rome in September 1508 at the invitation of the Pope. From this time on, he dedicated his life's energy to the frescoes of the Vatican. The most famous of the paintings he painted on the walls of Nicholas V's room are "The Fire in the Borgo," which is based on a legend from the ninth century, "The Discussion of the Holy Sacrament," which symbolizes the victory of the Catholic Church, "Parnassus," which is based on the gathering of Greek gods, and "The School of Athens," which praises the prosperity of ancient Athenian learning; in these famous paintings, we can see the cultural form of the Renaissance, where the traditional Christian thought of the Middle Ages and the reborn ancient pagan culture are in harmony.</p>
<p>Among the famous paintings of the painting saint Raphael, "The Discussion of the Holy Sacrament" and "The School of Athens" have particularly noble artistic value. The former's characters are divided into two types: the heavenly realm and the lower realm; in the crowd in the lower realm, you can see Dante and Savonarola, and you can also see Raphael's acquaintance, the architect Bramante. The meaning of this work goes without saying that it symbolizes the victory of Catholic theology. As for "The School of Athens," it symbolizes the victory of science; in this painting, there are many famous philosophers and scientists of ancient Greece centered on Plato and Aristotle, and you can also see Raphael's own face. Both of these paintings are the most famous works in art history, and everyone who visits the Vatican should especially appreciate them.</p>
<p>In addition, in the room called "Raphael Loggia," there are also scenes from the Old and New Testaments painted by Raphael; this is also a very famous and great work.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are many famous paintings in the Sistine Chapel, which was built by Sixtus IV in 1473. Most of these famous paintings are works from 1481-83, and they are all based on the themes of the Mosaic Tradition and Christ. Their authors are Perugino, Pinturicchio, Botticelli, and Signorelli, etc. At the same time, on the dome of this chapel, there are also paintings by Michelangelo from 1508-10. The theme of this painting is selected from the Old Testament Holy Scriptures, and around it are seven prophets and five female prophets; there are also many crowds, all of whom are naked figures with powerful muscles, they are dancing and showing different postures, showing a sentimental mood.</p>
<p>At the same time, on the large wall of the altar on the front of the chapel, there is a large mural painted by Michelangelo from 1534-41, which is the famous "The Last Judgment." This painting is 20 meters high and 10 meters wide, and it depicts a large group of naked figures showing a dramatic scene, and another group of naked people playing music. The greatness of its arrangement and the vividness of its expression are really rare in the history of modern painting.</p>
<p>The museum is divided into three parts: one is to display ancient works of art from Egypt, Greece, Etruria, Rome, etc., the second is a display room mainly for Italian paintings from the 13th to the 16th centuries, and the other is a display room for Raphael's paintings. In these display rooms, in addition to the works of art mentioned above, there are also many artistically valuable heritages, but this is not</p>

<p>discussed in detail here.</p>
<p>In addition, in the library, there are 50,000 valuable manuscripts and many historical letters, which are also valuable items owned by the Vatican, and of course, they are also what everyone who comes here to visit pays special attention to.</p>

<p>Mossy air floats over the green city. Quietly, the slanting sun has sleeves of silk. Saliva is like being bathed in. Only Shuang'e allows Qingjing Moon. Accompanied by you in the shadow of the wall, lonely. Already has ten buckets of autumn heart stored. Can withstand the slight cold and withstand the dew. Looking at the tear marks, I still hate the red window candle. Flashing under the leaves. Butterfly clothes are green. The flowers and plants in front of you are concerned with singing and crying. All are lingering ancient grievances of the Six Dynasties. Sixth new song. Lead water embryos are conceived and the soul is tied. It's not like hesitating to leave. It is Zheng's tears and Xiang's spots are entrusted. What is the matter with Mei Chu's sadness? The thin and weak shadow begs for sparse smoke. Afraid of sooner or later. Become fragmented.</p>

<p>On the day when I chose Qingdao, I painted a fan with different ideas, Qiong Xiang Yaya Zuo. The eyebrow marks are Su Su sad. Clouds scale the place where the jade hook hooks. I saw a glimpse of the curtain and looked back. Chen's wishes are not fulfilled. Feng Huai does not accept the night. The dew altar stars are clean in autumn.

Du Mu's army sound will enter the chant. I was kissed by the bearded Su. I also borrowed to talk about soldiers. Thousands of horses are restless. All are vertical shadows.</p>
<p>Mr. Ren Zhongshu of Shanyin is good at, and also paints, sings, and is not proficient in Gangfu. He died young, and the scholar-officials mourned his death.

<p>Humorous Sketches</p>
<h3 id="e208">An Ode to the Nose <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Qian Boming</p>
<p>Have you ever considered, dear reader, how admirable the organ of the nose is?</p>
<p>The nose; yes, the nose. It is the nose, this very thing, that is so useful to every animal, as Ovid (Roman poet - translator) said, lifting its face to the heavens!</p>
<p>Ah, it seems strange, a great act of ingratitude, that no poet has ever thought to write a lyrical poem for the nose!</p>
<p>Therefore, this task is left to me, but I am not a poet, I can only ask to be placed after our greatest poets and accept such an opinion.</p>
<p>Indeed, the nose is unfortunate.</p>
<p>For the eyes, so many things have been created: songs, toasts, and kaleidoscopes, paintings, landscapes, and spectacles.</p>
<p>For the ears: earrings, of course, go without saying, as well as the Stradivarius violin, the Erard piano, and the saxophone.</p>
<p>For the mouth: there is the Lenten (religious ritual of the forty days before Easter - translator) bland cooking, the nutritionist's recipe, the gourmet's culinary dictionary. They prepare all kinds of soups for it, from Russian broth to French cabbage soup; many foods for the mouth are also related to the fame of the greatest figures, from the Soubise cutlet to the Lü Xiaolu pudding: its lips are compared to coral, its teeth to pearls, and its breath to fragrance. Previously, it has eaten unfeathered peacocks and snipe with ungutted entrails; as for the future, it still has the hope of eating various roasted larks.</p>
<p>But what has been created for the nose? Only rose oil and snuff.</p>
<p>In fact, the nose is the most loyal to you. The eyes sleep, the mouth closes, the ears do not hear, but the nose is always on duty. It takes care of your sleep and contributes to your health. Feet, hands, and all other parts of the body are dull. Hands often do foolish things, feet stumble, and the body falls because of their clumsiness. When they do so, they can be carefree, but the poor nose is punished for their mistakes.</p>
<p>Have you not often heard it said: "So-and-so broke his nose"?</p>
<p>Since the beginning of time, there have been countless broken noses. But who can give a simple example to prove that a broken nose is its own fault? No one. Nevertheless, the poor nose is often scolded.</p>
<p>Ah, it endures all this with natural patience. Indeed, it sometimes snores rudely; but where, when have you ever heard your own nose snoring?</p>
<p>Now, let us forget the usefulness of the nose for a moment and pay attention to it solely from an aesthetic point of view.</p>
<p>The nose is like a cedar on Mount Lebanon, trampling a clump of bristles underneath; a central pillar that supports the two arches of the eyebrows. At its center dwells sharp thought; it wrinkles with a smile. The nose of the Great Conde—his greatness really came from his nose—in Lens and Rocroi, when the Spanish invaded, there their conquerors bravely wielded the staff of command, the Great Conde's nose entered before the others, and also before the Great Conde himself. Drouot's nose protruded before the crowd, his nose knew how to make twenty-four different kinds of twists, each time interesting.</p>
<p>No, I do not believe that the nose should be treated with ingratitude and still be forced to remain in the dark.</p>
<p>I propose a reason why the nose suffers under this injustice, which is that Western noses are so small.</p>
<p>How terrible it would be if Western noses were the only noses. But those Eastern noses, especially the noses of Georgia (a place name in old Russia - translator), are all extremely beautiful and huge noses.</p>
<p>Gentlemen of Paris, Vienna, and St. Petersburg, have you questioned the superiority of your own noses? In that case, my Viennese friends, go down the Danube River; you Parisians, take a boat; St. Petersburg people, take a sled; and say this simple sentence: "Go to Georgia."</p>
<p>However, I warn you in advance that you will be greatly humiliated. Even if you bring one of the largest noses in Europe to the gates of Tiflis (a place name near Georgia - translator), the people there will stare at you in amazement and say: "How pitiful, this gentleman dropped his nose on the road."</p>
<p>Ah, God - these beautiful Georgian noses! Strong noses, great noses! They come in various shapes: round, fat, long, large. They come in various colors: white, pink, deep red, violet. Some are adorned with rubies, some with pearls; I saw one adorned with turquoise.</p>
<p>In Georgia, King Vakhtang IV (name of an emperor in the old Russian era - translator) abolished meters and the yard system and only used the nose system. All goods must be measured by the nose. They say: "I bought seventeen noses of flannel to make pajamas, seven noses of wool to make a pair of pants, and one and a half noses of satin to make a bow tie." And in general, Georgian women find this measurement more convenient than European measurements.</p>

<h3 id="e209">Review of "Cosmic Wind" Issue 26 <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Senran</p>
<p>—Published at No. 10, Yugu Village, Yuyuan Road, this city, priced at _ corner per issue—</p>
<p>"Cosmic Wind," in the impression of general readers, seems to be a publication that makes humor; as soon as it is mentioned, people will think of "The Analects." However, after reading the twenty-sixth issue of "Cosmic Wind," I felt that it was not humorous, although the editors were still those famous humor masters. What is the reason for this? We don't quite understand; perhaps it is because the humor masters' senses are sharp, and they feel that in the current situation, talking about coolness is a bit "this road is blocked."</p>
<p>The twenty-sixth issue of "Cosmic Wind" came up with a special issue, which followed the twenty-fifth issue, with the general title of "Special Issue on Japan and the Japanese, Part II." Most of what is discussed in it is about Japanese culture and the lives of Japanese people. As for the significance of the publication of this special issue, it can be seen in these few sentences: "If someone loves Japanese civilization and thinks that everything about it is good, and tries to cover up its ugliness, or if someone hates violence and overturns everything, thinking that Japan has no culture, these are both equally wrong." These are the words of Mr. Zhou Zuoren in "Talking about Japanese Culture Books," and the publication specially excerpted them and printed them in red on the cover; its intention is undoubtedly to tell us: the publication's reason for publishing that special issue and its attitude towards the question can be expressed by Mr. Zhou's words. If the meaning of those few sentences is further extended and explained in connection with the content of this special issue, it is to arouse our attention to Japanese culture and the lives of Japanese people, to make us know its good and bad points, its strengths and weaknesses, so as to correct our own shortcomings and remedy our own weaknesses. This kind of expression is of course beyond reproach, but after reading the special issue of "Cosmic Wind," what we first felt was that some of the advantages of Japanese culture and Japanese people mentioned in the special issue are not worth praising, let alone worth learning from. For example, the article "The Life and Entertainment of Japanese Women" boasted about how Japanese women are "diligent, thrifty, gentle, and obedient," and how they have "etiquette," and even praised the "kneeling and sending off a customer by a Japanese female clerk" and the "kneeling and deeply thanking a guest for a tip by a maid," saying that this is "good service" to customers and a manifestation of understanding "etiquette." It is true that Japanese women have many advantages, and "diligence," "gentleness and obedience," and emphasis on "etiquette" are also worthy of praise, but serving men in that way, "kneeling and kowtowing" to guests in that way, seems to be too "gentle and obedient" and too much "etiquette." Women are also human beings, not slaves, so why just "kneel and kowtow" to please men or guests? Although Chinese women have not yet completely broken free from the shackles of old etiquette, they have not yet "</p>

<p>Kneeling to send off" men, this point can also be said to be a place where Chinese women are not as good as Japanese women, but our female compatriots do not seem to feel ashamed because of this, and of course there is no need to learn "kneeling and kowtowing" from Japanese women. In this way, what is the significance of that special praise for Japanese women's ability to "kneel and kowtow"?</p>
<p>Speaking of Japanese entertainment, some of them are indeed more noble and elegant than those of China, but the Chinese entertainment industry is not completely insignificant. For example, in recent years, Chinese films (if films can be said to be a kind of entertainment) have made great progress, and some films can even be said to be better than Japanese films. However, the author of "The Life and Entertainment of Japanese Women," in addition to greatly praising Japanese films about science and military affairs, completely negated Chinese films and said that they were all worthless. He said: "Their (referring to the Japanese) films are mostly about science and military affairs, such as the manufacture and use of submarines, the combat power of tanks, and the reconnaissance and destruction of enemy situations by aircraft, which are their main themes. It is far less than our country's ability to specially manufacture such scientific educational tools into deeds that 'induce people to walk on the road of depravity.' If you don't believe me, just look at what kind of films they think are the most fashionable and popular in this time of serious national crisis. Needless to say, they are either cheesy and obscene love films or superstitious masterpieces that cheat people to death; other than that, our country's film companies do not have the resources to do it, and even if they can, they will not be able to recover their costs because they do not suit the tastes of the general public." In this way, Chinese films are all "cheesy love films" and "superstitious masterpieces that cheat people to death," and these are all produced because of the demands of the general public, so all responsibility should of course be borne by the public. I don't know if this gentleman has seen domestic films in recent years. According to what we know, films such as "Song of the Fishermen," "Goddess of Freedom," "Peach and Plum Calamity," and "The Stray Lamb" can even be said to be unsurpassed by general foreign films; and those "unplayable" dramas and films are even more suitable for the current urgent needs. However, this gentleman did not pay attention and completely negated all domestic films, which is really puzzling! As for those Japanese films that show "aircraft reconnaissance of enemy situations and destruction of enemy sides," in our view, they are consistent with their national conditions and have a great relationship with the liberation of the Chinese nation, but this gentleman did not clearly indicate that significance to arouse the attention of the people of the country and the world; he indicated only praise: this also makes us a little inexplicable!</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Zuoren said in "Talking about Japanese Culture Books," after he talked about some of the advantages of Japanese culture: "What I want to mention here in passing is what is the use of talking about these cultures. To be honest, this is useless. The good aspects may not be able to save the country, and the bad aspects will not lead to selling the country. Recently, there have been some fashionable calls, such as cultural aggression or cultural traitors, but in my opinion, culture is also somewhat powerless in this relationship." Therefore, although this issue of "Cosmic Wind" introduced us to some of the cultural situation of Japan and the living conditions of the Japanese people, it did not closely link these with the current Sino-Japanese relations for discussion; it did not even mention the many ways in which Japan deals with us in terms of culture. This situation makes us even more unable to say that this special issue has no realistic and active effect.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Japanese culture described in this special issue is only the fragmented impressions of each author, and it has not enabled us to have an overall understanding of Japanese culture; moreover, those Japanese cultural phenomena that they talked about are only extremely superficial, and they have not been able to more deeply explore why Japan has those cultural phenomena. For example, they pointed out that Japan accepts Western and Chinese culture and forms it into its own culture. But how can Japan do this? This can of course only be explained from its social development, because a certain cultural phenomenon is produced by a certain social form; that is, a country's acceptance of another country's culture is only possible because the social forms of the two are somewhat similar, otherwise it is impossible to accept it. Take Gorky's novels and read them aloud to the uncivilized Indians in the Americas, and those people will not immediately accept the ideas in the novels and become the most progressive group of people; take a batch of American machines and transport them to Qinghai and Inner Mongolia, and they will not suddenly become the highest capitalist society and accept American culture. What is the reason for this? In a word, it is because the two do not have similar social lives, and there are no groups of people with similar lives. "Cosmic Wind" pointed out that Japan accepts Eastern and Western cultures, but did not explain its social essence and its relationship with Western Europe and Chinese society, so we can only superficially know some Japanese cultural phenomena, and we cannot have a deep understanding of it.</p>
<p>Naturally, some of the Japanese cultural phenomena and the strengths of some Japanese people's lives recorded in the special issue, such as Japan's progressive literature, many artistic techniques, the styles of Japanese newspapers and magazines and their attention to technology in various aspects, and the diligence and thrift of Japanese people's lives, are all things that we should learn. However, in my opinion, it is natural to learn from the strengths of the Japanese, but in the current situation, simply learning those things on the surface will not make us rich and strong. Since the Reform Movement of 1898 and the Revolution of 1911, have we not been working hard to Westernize? But as a result, on the one hand, there are naturally some good gains, but on the other hand, have not the Westernized lives of comprador businessmen and the extravagance of general Western venues been produced? Has it not made our culture increasingly manifest as a colonialized culture in many places? The reason for this is that the fundamental issue of national independence has not been thoroughly resolved, and we cannot melt other people's things and make them our own. Therefore, in the current China, to talk about accepting other people's culture, it must be discussed together with the fundamental issue of national independence in order to have positive significance. But "Cosmic Wind's" special issue failed to do this.</p>
<p>In addition to the special issue, there are several articles in this issue of "Cosmic Wind" that are worth reading, such as Mr. Guo Moruo's serialized "On the Way to the Northern Expedition" and Mr. Lao She's "Rickshaw Boy," although we only saw a part of them in this issue, we also felt the benefits of these two works. There are also Lao Xiang's "The Record of Taking the Exam," He Rong's "The Record of Invigilating," and short articles such as Kang De's "Saving the Country with Harmony," Li An's "Social Customs," and Fu's "Abandoning Learning to Take the Exam," which are all very good; especially those articles describing and evaluating our examination system are written truthfully and movingly. Based on these, we still have reason to say here: "Cosmic Wind" also has its advantages; compared to "The Analects," it is much more progressive. As for the shortcomings of its special issue mentioned above, that is also a criticism of some of its expressions, and it does not mean that this publication is all poisonous juice and cannot be read. On the contrary, compared to those publications that treat cheesiness as interesting and specialize in human beauty, and even those popular gentleman's publications, "Cosmic Wind" has its points that are worth recommending.</p>

<h3 id="e210">Poultry Trade <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Weiyuan</p>
<p>"Killing a chicken to prepare millet" has become an old saying for treating guests with respect. At the same time, Shanghai people add dishes like "white cut chicken," "roasted duck," and "soy sauce duck"; Cantonese restaurants offer "soy sauce chicken"; Nanjing people run shops selling "salted duck" and "duck gizzards"; Peking restaurants run by Shandong people offer "Peking duck"; and in Anhui restaurants, you can eat "Phoenix Wonton" (chicken and duck cooked together in one pot). These all show the close relationship between poultry and people.</p>
<p>New-style chicken farms in Shanghai are indeed increasing day by day, attracting much attention from society. Interviews and introductions are abundant. This article specifically introduces the situation of old-style poultry traders. From the mid-autumnal seventh lunar month to the mid-autumnal ninth lunar month is the peak season for chicken, duck, and goose trading (spring is the quietest). The total amount traded by merchants in the local north and south markets (Sixteen Pux and Dongjiadu) and Pudong, Tangqiao, and other places is worth about one million several hundred thousand yuan. In addition, there are several hundred thousand that either do not go through merchants or are handled by smaller merchants, totaling more than two million yuan. Why is autumn the busiest season? It is said that the reason why spring is the quietest is that the preserved meats stored by people in winter (such as wind-dried chicken, cured meat, sausages, etc.) have not yet been eaten. By the time the preserved meats are finished, it is already gradually getting warmer, and people do not like to eat greasy food and prefer to eat more vegetarian dishes. After summer is over, the autumn breeze brings coolness, the mind is clear, and the appetite is sure to open up. Therefore, at this time, everyone wants to eat and drink, seeking pleasure in food. Delicious chicken and duck are, of course, the objects of desire, and the cooking in restaurants at this time is even more pleasing. According to general poultry merchants, veteran gourmets, and kitchen stewards, the varieties of chicken and duck in this city are quite interesting. Now, let's describe the approximate situation of the place of origin of chickens and ducks and the traditional trade habits:</p>
<p>(1) Pudong Chicken: Also known as local chicken, its body shape is square, quite heavy, with sparse feathers and varied colors, mostly yellow with green and black spots. It often has feathered feet, quite like a foreign breed. It can weigh up to eight or nine pounds, hence the name "Nine-Pound Yellow." Its incubation and brooding instincts are very developed, and the meat tastes very good. If it can be improved, it can become a good meat chicken, not difficult to rival the foreign Cochin.</p>
<p>(2) Chongming Chicken: The body shape is similar to the local chicken, the feather color is mostly light. The feet are also [missing character], the body weight is also large, the body is quite strong, and it lays many eggs, reaching more than one hundred and fifty a year.</p>
<p>(3) Tongzhou Chicken: That is, the chickens produced in Nantong Prefecture and Rugao and Taixing counties. The body shape is square and slightly longer, the feather color is mostly black, more compact than Pudong chickens, the leg color is uneven, and there are slight feathers on the feet. The body weight is slightly smaller, the meat tastes good, and it lays more than one hundred eggs a year. The chicks are very easy to raise.</p>
<p>(4) Huaian Chicken: That is, the chickens produced in the old Huaian Prefecture, such as [missing character] Jiang, Huaicheng, and other counties. The body weight is smaller than Pudong and Chongming chickens, with blue legs and bird beaks, and is not very popular. The feather color is also not uniform. The most deaths occur after this chicken arrives in port, probably due to the hardship of traveling a long distance?</p>
<p>(5) Black-boned Chicken: Commonly known as woolly chicken, imported from Songjiang and various ports in Jiangbei, but not many people raise it, so there are very few people in the trade. The feather color is pure white and slightly curled, the mouth and legs are all black, very short, and the belief in protecting chicks is extremely strong. The meat quality is also good, and people in Guangdong and Fujian love to eat it the most. This chicken is generally used for appreciation, so the price is very expensive, mostly sold by pigeon and game shops.</p>
<p>(6) Port Duck: There are distinctions between port ducks, Yangzhou ducks, and Yangtze River ducks. Those produced in the old Tongzhou prefecture, such as Rugao and other places, are called "port"; those produced in the old Yangzhou prefecture, such as Gao, Bao, Xing, Tai, Dong, and Jiangdu counties, are called "Yangzhou"; those produced along the Yangtze River, such as Wuhu and Nanjing, are called "Yangtze River". The three types are very similar in shape, and only those experienced in this field can distinguish them. Port ducks are not very large but are easy to fatten, with yellow feet and bird beaks, mottled feathers, high tail, and legs behind the body. At first glance, you know that it is a breed good at laying eggs. Gaoyou ducks (Yangzhou) produce eggs with double yolks, which are very popular. This kind of duck is extremely easy to raise, so Gaoyou duck eggs are very famous.</p>
<p>(7) Goose: All areas north of the Yangtze River produce them, but those produced in the old Yangzhou prefecture are more numerous. The feathers are white, the beak is yellow, the legs are also yellow, the crown is tall, and the body weight can reach more than twenty pounds. The male's call is loud, early-maturing, easy to fatten, and the meat quality is also good, but the goslings are not easy to raise. Cantonese people love to eat goose the most, and Muslims use goose oil instead of lard and beef tallow.</p>
<p>The source of chickens and ducks for daily use in this city, in addition to the above-mentioned places, Danyang, Liyang and other places also produce many ducks, and many are imported into this city. As for the poultry trade, it is divided into north and south markets. The south market refers to Dongjiadu, and the north market refers to Sixteen Pux; it does not refer to South Shanghai and Zhabei. There are five large poultry shops in the south market: three chicken shops, Shen Dachang, Shen Chang, and Yishengyuan; and two duck shops, Xin Changshun and Nan Defeng; all located in the Dongjiadu area of ​​Pubin. There are eight in the north market: Defeng, Wanfeng, Puyi, Hemei, Xieji, all located on Wai Ma Road; Taihefeng, Hongda, and Yutai, all located in Lao Taiping Lane. In addition, there are three shops on Wai Ma Road, Hengda, Gongji, and Hengtai, but they specialize in ducks and game, such as wild ducks, old wild ducks, and egrets. The other chicken and duck shops, such as Chen Yongfeng and Defeng in Lao Taiping Street, Yu Longji in Zengxiang Street, Zhao Mingji in Jiyong Street, and Chen Tongxing in Huiguan Street, are not merchants, but buy and resell from merchants to vendors, so they are not included in the public office. The equipment of each shop is to place chicken and duck cages in front of the store. The scales used are all issued by the public office. Merchants provide food and lodging to guests, so bedding must be prepared, but the temporary feed for chickens and ducks is the responsibility of the vendors. Speaking of transportation, most are transported by boat to Sixteen Pux and landed. Customers are free to submit to a merchant. After designation, the shop assistants will transport the chickens and ducks to the shop and are not allowed to solicit on the way. As for vendors, they use small carts to load cages and transport them to Zhabei, Hongkou, Qiujiang Road, Miller Road, and other places. In the south market, they are in the Xuejia Bang and Li Ma Road areas; in the Public Concession, they are in Tie Fangzi and Xiaocai Chang; in the French Concession, they are in Caishi Road and other places. The poultry trade has the organization of the Shanghai Juyuantang Poultry Industry Public Office, its address is in Lao Taiping Street. The public office has 20 public rules set in the year of Jiazi of the Republic of China, and there are also rules for the industry to rectify the sale of chickens, ducks, and geese, which are serious. As for the tax situation, it only started to be recognized at the end of the Qing Guangxu period, with a total amount of 1,300 silver yuan; by the 14th year of the Republic of China, it gradually increased to 4,920 yuan; after the 15th year of the Republic of China, it increased to 8,000 yuan. Those who enter the chicken and duck public office must have a capital of at least 30,000 yuan, because too little capital may lead to the risk of bankruptcy, which will affect the public office. Those who opened after the eighth year of the Republic of China must pay a public office fund of 500 yuan, because after the merchants go bankrupt, the public office must be responsible for maintaining the aftermath.</p>
<p>In the 18th year of the Republic of China, the poultry merchants Qiao Zhongxian and others submitted a request to the Social Bureau for permission to establish a trade association. Its members included 19 companies such as Puyi and Hemei, but there were more than one hundred dozens of companies engaged in transporting and selling chickens and ducks. The eggs of chickens and ducks are especially essential daily foods. It is estimated that there are more than 50 egg shops in this city, such as Maochang, Lu Boji, Xiji, Xiehe, Zhu Shenchang, and Xu Xinji, and there is also a trade association, which has close contact with the poultry trade, because "chickens are inseparable from eggs, and eggs are inseparable from chickens."</p>
<p>In the new-style chicken farms that improve chicken breeds, no effort is spared to improve eggs, but because the selling price is slightly higher, it is not popular after all, so the business of the egg shops is more prosperous. As for the factories in this city that process egg products and manufacture dry egg white and egg yolk powder, there are more than 30 in total, and 20 have joined the trade association. Because these egg factories are responsible for supplying the raw materials for the daily necessities of cakes, biscuits, egg rolls, and other snack foods. Its factory names include more than 20 companies such as Qian Yuan, Huaxing, Fengyu, Hexing, Huachang, Dingji, Qingcheng, Hongchang, Hongxin, Qingfeng, Dingsheng, Tongxin, Hong Yuchang, Yuansheng, Hongsheng, Han Xingxiang, Dingfeng, Zengxin, Xin Chang, and Songyuan.</p>

<p>— David</p>
<p>"No, there's no money in the box at all!" I answered firmly, despising them in my heart.</p>
<p>"Really nothing?"</p>
<p>"Really nothing!" I got a little angry.</p>
<p>"Open it and take a look!"</p>
<p>My face turned red, and I opened the box. The old image was impatient.</p>
<p>The policeman came over, flipped through it casually, and then dodged away.</p>
<p>The police officer questioned us: where we came from and the purpose of coming to "Xinjing". He asked very easily, not as strict as before.</p>
<p>We all felt relieved and answered him: we came from Fengtian and wanted to seek refuge at the "Datong College" in "Xinjing".</p>
<p>They all slowly backed out.</p>
<p>"God! Why did they want to joke with us!" The old image was overjoyed.</p>
<p>"Calm down! Outside..." I stopped the old image.</p>
<p>The accountant came over, and I asked him:</p>
<p>"What's the matter? Why are you checking the shop?"</p>
<p>"Don't you know, there was a robbery on Sanma Road at eight o'clock tonight." His small round eyes turned tightly after he finished speaking, and he walked away hurriedly.</p>
<p>I came in and told them the news, and everyone smiled at each other.</p>
<p>Yes: sensuality, gambling, tobacco and alcohol, theft, robbery, bullying, all of this is what we saw and heard during our more than 30 hours stay in the political center of "Kandao".</p>
<p>At twelve o'clock at night, we squeezed into the old train on the Harbin-Changchun Railway again.</p>
<p>This solid old carriage still hasn't changed its original shape, it's like seeing an old friend.</p>
<p>There were no lights in the car, and we were all groping in the darkness, groping.</p>
<p>We barely squeezed into a few seats, and the people sitting on both sides were all famine victims from Shandong.</p>
<p>A six- or seven-year-old child was so tired that he had nowhere to sleep, so his mother pushed him down on the floor of the car. The child didn't care about the dirt and saliva and fell asleep sweetly.</p>
<p>A sharp light shot from the left; behind the light, leading a yellow-clothed "police officer", slowly walked to the sleeping child.</p>
<p>"Sleeping is not allowed!..." He asked the child, who was fast asleep, viciously, and then kicked him with his leather shoe.</p>
<p>The child didn't move, and didn't breathe anymore.</p>
<p>He retracted the light from the electric torch and walked forward.</p>
<p>The mother's miserable cry, combined with the rolling sound of the wheels, shook the hearts of everyone in the car. We all quietly dodged away, unable to bear to hear the wailing of this weak person!</p>
<p>The stars twinkled sadly in the sky, as if crying for this little soul.</p>
<p>The dark and vast earth was covered with countless shadows; we, this group of weak people, all threw ourselves into its dark embrace.</p>
<p>The turbid morning mist and the coal smoke spewed out by the train's engine were intertwined, [missing character] [missing character] a [missing character], covering the ground</p>
<p>In the east, behind this layer of turbid mist, a pale red circle appeared.</p>
<p>The vegetable vendor, carrying a load on his shoulder, the cold made him turn with tears in his eyes; he stood impatiently outside the fence, waiting to cross the railway.</p>
<p>A group of stray dogs surrounded the back of the "killing cattle house", looking for discarded cattle bones.</p>
<p>I concentrated my attention and stretched my head out of the car window, looking for the house I lived in ten years ago.</p>
<p>The old image woke up from a nap and pushed me, saying, "Where are we? Why didn't you call us!"</p>
<p>"We're at Shanghao!"</p>
<p>They all woke up with a start, vying to look out the window.</p>
<p>Ah! I was so happy that tears came out. I wanted to jump out of the car window and kiss the little Latin-style house that I had been away from for ten years.</p>
<p>Its red-tiled roof stood there brightly and proudly, covered with a layer of dew. The small fence surrounding it, the few trees in front of the courtyard gate, and the white iron can skins [missing character] in the garbage pile on the left side of the house were all the same as when I lived here ten years ago, as if nothing had changed. But what about my gentle Russian hostess and her innocent and lovely Little Lina? In the courtyard surrounded by the fence, I vaguely saw some clothes that looked like Japanese clothes being dried. The big sleeves were blown by the wind, fluttering back and forth.</p>
<p>All of this, which was both intimate and unfamiliar, flashed quickly past my eyes.</p>
<p>The car stopped at the final destination—Harbin Qinjiagang Station.</p>
<p>The bustling crowd on the platform was still as crowded as it was ten years ago, but this Parisian girl from four years ago seemed to have married "×Jing", and the situation was a little different from before. The internal form of the station has completely changed, and the road names on all the road signs have been replaced with certain texts, which made us seem to understand but not understand; after bumping around for a long time, we finally rushed out of this chaotic intake and output port.</p>
<p>The car carrying the five of us ran along the station to Xugong Road.</p>
<p>Beside the road, the palace-style Third Middle School, like a fallen aristocratic son, was barely supporting itself there; the glaze on the red and green glazed tiles on the top had fallen off; the surrounding area was surrounded by layers of iron barbed wire, two bright bayonets were standing in front of the door, and a natural wooden sign was hung on the wall, with [missing character] [missing character] a few [missing character] words, like "Da××× Radio Class".</p>
<p>The car gasped and carried us across the intersection of Xugong Road again. Next to it, the library, which was under construction when I left Harbin, has now been completed; however, this building has not been used as a library, but has been changed to the "Harbin Provincial Police Department."
