<h3 id="c3">華北走私　日答覆英詰問　益使人焦慮　日拒絕担任恊助緝私計劃倫敦中國工會年會有討論 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>（倫敦）路透電社探悉、日政府答覆英國大使克萊武五月一日關於華北走私事之請問、毫不能解除英國對於此事之焦慮、聞日政府拒絕担任協助實施防杜走私之計畫、此間對於走私問題日臻嚴重、已露惶恐之象、今日路透社上海訪員發來電報、巳引起各方之重大注意、電中引中國　稅務司梅樂和之言曰、華北有組織的走私、共害必將及於以關稅爲抵之賠欵與債項、且上海與華北各口岸所收之關稅、佔海關稅收全年總數百分之八十八、故該問題不復爲純粹的內政事件、而已爲國際事件云、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國政府因中國北部走私問題、曾於本月二日、喚起日本政府注意、略謂、中國海關因該處駐有日本軍隊、迄未能採取適當步驟、以制止私運、日本政府旋於本月五日、提出答案、略謂、日本對於私運情事、並未加以鼓勵月亦受有扣害、英國外務部發言人頃宣稱、此項答案、英國政府未能認爲滿意、自當再要求加以說明、外務部人士並謂、自私運情事發生以還、中國關稅收入、每月的損失十二萬英鎊之鉅、該國外債、旣以關稅爲担保品、歐洲各國持券人之利益、自因而戚受嚴重影響云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日中國公會舉行年會時、主席裴那德氏曾剴切致詞、反映倫敦入士關於日本對華北走私事所持態　與所施行動之意見　裴氏述及中日　國之關係曰、日本對華政策之諸多困難吾人旣未輕視之、亦未不予以體諒、但日本之政策與其推進此政策所用之手段、吾人實不得不加以抨擊、半因此項困難不能由是而獲解决、半因現已由是引起種種嚴重危險之新問題、使中國與吾人同受其害、吾人所最反對者、厥爲日本人民漠視華北中國海關當局之行逕、余至少能舉一種貨品、因由大連走私運入中國之故、使英國此物在揚子江流域之銷數爲之大减、日本當局自稱彼等對於走私之舉、實不負責、要知因日當局所持對付中國海關之態度、天津中國海關當局現於處置走私者之行動、大受妨礙、此則事實昭彰者也、裴氏演說之結語、極讚中政府從事國家建設事業之顯著的努力、及其應付通貨問題之克奏厥功、裴氏致詞畢、溫特頓勳爵復被舉爲公會會長（十三日路透電）</p>

<p>化學對於人生的關係非常密切。人生的四大需要「衣食住行」和一個國家民族爭生存的種種工具，差不多沒有一樣不靠化學。自然原始的人類，只用樹葉　遮蔽着身體，也可以禦寒，只是茹毛飲血，也可以充飢，在樹上築巢，也可以住，不用舟車也可以行。但是人類的智慧好像一個龐大的鉅輪，隨着時間繼續在向前進展，像這樣的原始人類，在世界上已無存在的可能。現在的人類，不僅用衣來禦寒，並且用他來代表文明的程度，這就是古人所說的「衣以文身」了。要講到「文身」最重要的就是衣服的色彩，而表現色彩的染料，就得靠化學的硏究。食呢！不僅可以充飢，並且還要考究那些食物對於身體的營養最有效，怎樣吃法才不致妨碍健康，這些問題都得靠化學的研究，才能解决。談到住，所謂「穴居」當然不對，就是舊式的竹廬茅舍也算落伍，現代房屋的主要材料當然是磚和水泥，這兩種東西的製造，亦非靠化學的硏究不可。再談到行，譬如馬路上所舖的柏油，建築橋樑所需的鋼骨和水泥，鐵路的軌道，以及製造各種輪船，車輛，飛機等等所用的原料，多半都要靠化學的硏究，才能得到。就是推動這些交通器具的燃料，也要靠化學家的硏究，才能解决的。人類的生活除衣食住行而外，對於健康的保持，也是極重要的，而防疾治病的醫藥，就非由化學硏究不能獲得的。至於一個國家，要防備他人的攻擊，保障國家的和平，所需要的一切工具，也非靠化學不可。從這些事實看來，我們可以知道化學是人類智慧的泉源，也是現代文化的鎖鑰。</p>
<p>化學的用途旣是這樣寬廣，在很短的時間內當然不能統統講完，現在，只好舉幾個重要的問題來和大家談一談。</p>
<p>關於食的問題　飲食是人生主要問題，如果食的問題不能解决，其他的一切生活都談不到。從化學的觀點看來，這問題可分作兩方面來講：一是關於食物產量的問題，一是關於食物營養的問題。</p>
<p>食物產量的問題人類主要的食物，大部分都是從植物得來，植物的生長，大部分是靠氮素來維持。空氣并氮氧及其他少量氣體所組成，而氮的含量，佔了四分之三以上，氮的供給當然不怕缺乏。可惜一般植物，都不能直接由空中攝取氮素，一定要靠氮的化合物，如硝酸鹽等才能生長。我們知道動植物腐敗後，就有氨產生，逃入空中，經雨露溶解，降下來便可以肥沃土壤　不過這種氨量太少，並且植物不能直接利用。後來經英國人Warington硏究以後，才知道土壤中氨的變化，要靠微生物。這種微生物附於土壤，經空氣接觸，便能促進氨的變化。這種作用，好像酵母使糖類變成酒精一樣。這樣的微生物，普通有兩種：第一種先使氨的化合物變爲亞硝化物；第二種能使亞硝化物和空氣接觸後，變爲硝化物。變爲硝化物後，植物就可以直接利用。所以農夫耕田，翻土是很有效的方法，因爲這樣可以把土內的微生物和亞硝化物，翻到表面來與空氣接觸，使亞硝化物變爲硝化物。從前的人，只知道翻土的好處，而不知道好處在那裏。現在我們明白了。此外還有一種微生物，是附在植物的根上，如黃豆金花菜和其他的豆科植物的根，都有根瘤，裏面就有這種微生物存在，所以繼續種麥的土壤，變瘦了的時候，只要轉種豆類或金花菜，那末土壤又肥起來了。不過這種補救的方法，是很有限的。從　氮素肥料的來源，多半是靠智利硝，但是世界上的人口，天天有增加，所靠的智利硝天天减少，以有限的來源，供給無限的消費，自然必有缺乏的時候，所以在一八九九年，英國科學名家Sir　Wm．Crookes，曾經講過，假使大家不趕快設法攝取空中的氮素，那末五十年以後，世界就有飢荒的危險。當時經他一提醒，很多的化學家就努力於這樣的硏究，結果就有了德國Haber空中取氮法的發明，所以歐戰的時候，德國雖然四面被人封鎖，無法運入智利硝，而德國的肥料和火藥所需的氮，都不成問題。現在世界上農業發達的國家沒有不用人工氮素肥料的，各位看了下面的統計表，（一九三〇年）就會明白。</p>
<p>中國糧食每年入超有三萬萬元，與棉花爭進口第一二位。雖然交通不便，分配不勻，也是造成糧食不够的一部分原因，但也不致相差這樣多。要是一旦國家有事，海口封鎖，那末我們就有挨餓的危險。近年來人造肥料入口數量，亦甚可觀。民國十三年進口的硫酸錏値二百六十餘萬元，隨後逐年增加，到了民國十九年硫酸錏輸入値二千七百餘萬元，七年間增加了十倍，每年平均增加的百分之五十。去年永利公司在浦口辦了一個硫酸錏廠，資本很充足，規模也很大，將來這樣漏巵，當可以挽救一部分。</p>

<p>本市第八屆小學聯合運動會、已於昨日在市中心區體育場開幕、幸天無變化、各項節目均能順利舉行、茲分誌如次、</p>
<p>會塲情形</p>
<p>昨日天氣雖陰而各校學生前往參觀者將近萬人、大會親模雖小、而一切辦法悉照全運會辦理、故會場秩序、井井有條、各校旗幟、飄揚空中、顏色不同、頗爲鮮艷奪目、市衛生局特派醫師擔任救護、司令台上裝有傳聲筒、一切報吿、全場淸晰可聽、教局督學周斐成、馬崇淦·邵汝幹·科長陳白·宓季芳·及袁增煜·丁守棠等二十餘人、在場擔任招待事宜、</p>
<p>開幕儀式</p>
<p>十時行開幕禮、到吳市長·潘局長·市府秘書張廷榮·會務正副主任陳白·馬崇淦·邵汝幹·蔣建白·張詠春等、裁判員王復旦·林韻笙·李繼元等與全選手、先行繞場一週、奏樂升旗、行禮如儀後爲已故中常會主席胡漢民氏靜默三分鐘誌哀、即由主席吳市長致開會詞、會務主任陳白報吿、全體選手宜誓後、由市黨部代表林美衍、教育局潘局長相繼致訓、即禮成會操、</p>
<p>市長訓詞</p>
<p>吳市長致開會辭、各位小同學、今天是上海市舉行第八屆小學聯合運動大會、我們上海市小學聯合運動會、是第一次在上海市中心區體育場舉行、上海市所以要建設一個這樣大的體育場、以及去年之所以邀請全國運動大會在上海市來舉行、就是要提倡上海市的體育、喚起上海市的社會來注意體育、尤其要喚起我們的父母家長、對於兒童體育要注意、小學爲國民教育的基礎、體育是鍛鍊我們的體魄、使我們的身心健全、所以體育是教育的基本、我們一個人體格不健全、不發達、就是我們的基礎不鞏固、在不鞏固的基礎上、一切事業都不鞏固、人的基礎是體格、體格發達、身心健全、所受的教育、將來在社會上服務、事業才有希望成功、在個人說是這樣、在民族說、人人體格發達、民埃基礎鞏固、才能建設國家、復興民族、所以上海市政府嬰建築此偉大的體育塲及去年邀請全運會在此舉行、其意義即在積極的提倡體育、喚起社會注意體育、希望第八屈小學聯合運動會的成積比上屆好、這是今天舉行開幕儀式、要劉各位選手全體小學生來勉勵的幾句話、</p>
<p>潘局長詞</p>
<p>繼由陳白林美衍致詞後、潘局長訓詞、略謂　小學生體格完全要在平時學校家庭中鍜練起來、不能有一天間斷、鍜錬的目的並非爲了開運動會、而是爲了要替國家民族做事、運動會的意思、不過把平時鍜鍊體格的成績表演出來、互相競爭、以求進步、其實每個小學生無論是吾選手都要鍜鍊體格、　運動會的意思不但要各位注意鍛鍊體格、同時要注意會場秩序、大會紀律、運動道德、一切都要守秩序守紀律、使在三天的大會期間、沒有一個學校或學生發生不守紀律不守道德的事情、運動會才是成功、故在運動會中除鍜鍊體格外、團體生活的道德也要在這裏培養起來云、</p>
<p>游行宣誓</p>
<p>上午九時半宣佈開會、各區運動員、依照規定次序、滬南區爲首、中殷區殿後、前面導以公安局軍樂隊、旗幟鮮明、軍容喚發、於樂聲洋洋中繞場一週後、即齊集於司令台前、舉行宣誓典禮、由滬南一區羅壽煊代表令體宣誓、「余等謹本總理提倡體育之精神、以業餘運動員資格、參加比賽、服從運動評判、並恪遵大會一切規則、此誓、」</p>
<p>會操情形</p>
<p>開幕典禮畢、各校會齊三千名小學生、一律穿着白色制服、短者在前、長者在後、由各領隊分別帶領、魚貫入場、先游行運動一週、然後按照規定排列圖所示地位、站在場上各個表演地位之符號上、由邵汝幹司令、開始會操、各小學生動作一致、步伐整齊、博得吳市長、潘局長及各來賓掌聲不少、會操畢、並三呼「中華民國萬歲」、愛國之心、油然而生、爲大會節目中最精彩之一幕、</p>
<p>團體表演</p>
<p>昨日各校團體操表演、計有五十節之多、其中以萬竹之德式徒手操、和安之工路拳、私上之啞鈴操、城東之娃娃兵、養正之走步模仿操、梅溪之健身操、上海之小兵隊、澄衷之機巧運動、和安之敏捷訓練等整齊美觀、純熟活潑、最是博得觀衆好評、此外如務本之健身舞、唐灣之蘇格蘭土風舞、以及敬業之國術等等、亦均可取、</p>
<p>田徑成績</p>
<p>昨日决賽項目連表演組共計舉行九項、中以男丙鉛球洋涇區王業超、以十二公尺六二五、打破廣公張兆通保持十一公尺七九之最高紀錄、最爲可貴、預賽項目中、男乙二百公尺成績最佳、法華居維仁廿八秒一、特一陳國堯廿八秒四、均破廣一張晏淸保持之廿八秒八最高紀錄、洋涇趙仲芳則紀錄相等、其餘各項成績亦尙優、</p>
<p>決賽素描</p>
<p>男甲八百公尺、參加者三十七人之多、繞場兩週、而中途退出者有十餘人、金趙生一路領先、以二分廿四秒八到達終點、離最高紀錄五秒許、加以努力、不難打破、山妙泉最初勁力尙足、惟到達終點漸形氣餒、致離金趙生僅二十米許退居第二、</p>
<p>男甲跳遠羅壽煊以五公尺十四獲冠軍、其資勢頗佳、的是可造之才、第二吳純華四公尺九三、第三金光耀四公尺六九、第四戴行樑四公尺六四、第五姚舜耕四公尺五六、第六雷荣　四公尺五一五、</p>
<p>男丙鉛球王業超較預選成續大爲進步、昨以十二公尺六二五破紀錄、第二李寶昌十一公尺二十亦不弱、第三張　明十一公尺十九、第四改相寅十公尺二十、第五鐘梓超十公尺十九、第六徐松林十公尺、</p>
<p>男乙跳高吳舫林姿勢尙欠訓練、故至一公尺三三五後、脚力尙餘而不能越竿、第二至第四均爲一公尺二七、第五一公尺二一</p>
<p>女子立定跳遠丙組參加者最衆、陳勇華二公尺〇二、第二一公尺九五、第三一公尺九三、第四一公尺九二、第五一公尺九〇、第六一公尺八九、相差均甚微、</p>
<p>會塲拾零</p>
<p>昨天是本市第八屆小學聯運會開幕的第一日、在全部節目中、當然以三千小學生的大會操、爲最屬目最精彩的一幕偉大場面、一片碧草如茵的廣場上、三千穿着白色制服的小朋友們、極有規律的排列在中間、遠望過去、絕似一幅用圖案交織成的大絨毯、眞是美觀極了、當他們每一節動作完了、四座的掌聲便不的而同的鼓動起來、最後、小朋友們、在司令者的領導之下、三呼「中華　國萬歲、那種洪亮的口號、　動了大人們的心弦、愛國的熱情、頓時漫　了整個的會場、予人以一種深刻的印象、</p>
<p>昨天、是我們黨國元勳胡漢民先生逝世的第三天、會場上的國旗、黨旗、以及大會的會旗、都扯上一半、便停止了、但見　角飄搖於忽雨忽陰的天空中、使我把於慶祝盛會之餘、平添了無窮的悲悼、</p>
<p>小學運動會、在市運動場舉行、這還是第一次、昨日到會的學生、不能算少、人數總在七八千以上、要是處置在大吉路體育場的話、早就有人滿之患了、但在這裏、除西司令台一帶、擠滿了人頭以外、南北兩端的看台、簡直冷落不堪、於此可見這個達築物容量之大了、</p>
<p>各校的體體操表演、昨日計有五十節之多、過了一場又一塲、極盡五花八門之能事、如入山陰道上、大有應接不暇之勢、論表演的成績、大概總是不錯的、也許專前經過長時間的準備也說不定、壞的常然不會在這裏漏臉的了、</p>
<p>過鎊這一件事、運動員大都視為畏途的、往往因些微的差別、即取消其已得的分數、爲要使其不超過規定的磅數、於是在事前餓肚子的也有、過磅時候赤身洗足的也有、爲狀是十分的悽慘、</p>
<p>幼稚生表演、早已公認爲有趣的節目、但昨日祗有城東的娃娃兵、上海的小軍隊、其美的小燕子等數項而已、而服飾方面、也較往年爲馬虎、這或許也是受着不景氣的影響吧、</p>
<p>本屆的錦標制度、以區爲單位、打破以前學校與學校競爭的舊習慣、此次錦標得主、照形勢觀察、以滬南與特一兩區、最有希望、和安小學是特一區的首腦、該校的棒場學生、特別來得多、高踞在司令台之側、興趣異常濃厚、每見本區學生獲勝、搖旂吶喊、聲震四座、小朋友的熱情、不知不覺中便流露出來了、團體操（上）城東小學幼稚生表演哇哇兵（下）萬竹小學表演德式操（麟攝）男生乙組跳高决賽、自右至左、　吳舫林　顧濟良　阮瑞芝　顏信芳　胡培松　張宗尙（中）男生甲組八百公尺决賽、自右至左、　金趙生　山妙泉　許榮良　曹興弟　張文淸　伏迺堂（下）男生丙組鉛球决賽　王業超　李寶昌　張錫鵬　改柏寅　鍾梓超　徐松林（麟攝）</p>

<p>— 櫻子</p>
<p>—憶白靈廟—</p>
<p>塞外的春天，似乎來得特別遲。已是暮春三月了，在江南，說是羣鶑亂飛的時候了吧？塞外却－直落着春雪，一場又一場。春雪雖然不及冬雪寒冷，一落地就融化了；可是，大青山上的雪却是一落下去就凝凍起來，氣候便也只有冷冰冰的了。</p>
<p>然而，春天也終竟來到塞外了。清明節颳了一天大黃風，飛沙走石，撲打着人的面頰，傍晚竟下起雨來了，雨點亂豆似的飄落着！又冷又硬。天氣像是在深秋季節，沁人身心的使人發冷戰，我披着毛布大　在街頭上踉蹌着要歸去。無意中却遇見了一堆人，前面的一個提着手杖，穿着陰丹士林布大衫，面孔上有着紅麻子的中年人，一點頭過去了。自己也下意識地點了點頭，猛然間竟想不起和自己客氣的這位是誰了。過後才想到鐵不派那位去年到白　　的時候，折磨我的好朋友嗎？人竟是這麽善忘的東西呢。若不是他那副罩着「陰丹士林」衫的背影和那一副帶着麻點子的特殊尊容，我真想不起他是誰了。</p>
<p>想起了是他，我不禁被過去的憤怒抓住了，這一個害我不能看白靈廟蒙古風光的傢伙，他如今又跑向這裏來了，他不是在那－個友邦一手造成的寶貝國恭喜着嗎？</p>
<p>往事像繭似的－層層被剝出來，離開去白靈廟不過一年，我怎麽會不記得：一年前此時我是帶着怎樣的心情，在白靈廟的蒙古包中，一個人忍受着污辱，在蒙古原野中受着折磨呢。</p>
<p>自己去白靈廟的時候，正是×會和×省府在鬧着不可開交的稅收問題，為了兩家的交惡，作為×政府機關報的塞外報紙，便對×會大大地攻擊嘲罵了一頓。我自己是塞外新聞界一個小小職員，也未嘗不知道在這時候到×會的中心地，白靈廟—自觸霉頭。可是為了一晌蓄意要看蒙古風光的心情和隨行有六十多個男女孩子的緣故，便也冒充在男女孩子裏面作為他們中的一個，冒着險去了。想不到在半路中就會被人家認出來，而認出來的就是這位今日和我點頭的先生呢！</p>
<p>走過了大青山，因了等候壞了的兩輛汽車在孤城！「武川」住下來。我便被一位見過面而不熟識的當地人間的露出馬脚，第二天一出武川城，這位面上充滿了紅麻子的×會的科長導領孩子們的先生見我登車了，便向男女孩子們的臨時團長追詢出我來。車一直駛向北去，穿過了無逐的大草原，前面依舊是望不見的無邊無涯的蒙古原野。這時侯，這位有着紅麻子的先生向我提出讓我下車，我望了望四面，四野是灰霧的一片，狂風在草原上呼嘯着，不用說百里內看不見一個人烟，就是牛羊也沒有一個，我的求生熱念使我拒絕了下車。於是，道位科長又向我提出：「為了到了白靈廟，怕那位負　着對我不利，不讓我住蒙古包和民房。」那意思也是在表明他是為了怕我吃苦頭的。</p>
<p>到了白靈廟，過了那條小河，在蒙古包前停下來，那位科長便照着他半路中對我說的話要我履行，我在黃昏中睜大了眼再向四面望去，除過了散落的六七十個蒙古包外，西面是在晚霞中輝映的白靈廟，河東是一些土房子，此外呢，便只有蒙古包後面半禿的山，天蒼蒼地茫茫的大原野，而我却耍像一個嬰孩被人家拋棄在它上面。被風吹，沙子打，說不定夜間野獸出來還會被葬在獸腹中。我的求生慾念，再沒有比這時候更强烈的了。我堅持着要這位科長給我找住處，我明知道這地方除了蒙古包，廟，河東的房屋，去什麽地方住去呢？</p>
<p>幸而還好，這位紅麻子科長終還沒有致我於死地的决心，我終於在－些男女孩子們懸切的要求下，住入了蒙古包。然而條件雙來了，是：「直到離開白靈廟的時候，不准出包外。」</p>
<p>第二天，被嘟噠　噠的軍號聲驚醒了以後，在冷冰冰的鋪在地上的被中，我望着蒙古包圓頂上的青青天空發着愁：「出去不出去呢？」我躊躇着，最後，為了蒙古包中還不能有我大小便的地方便也大着胆出去了。</p>
<p>呵！出去又能怎樣呢！</p>
<p>在望過蒙古包後山頭上的「鄂博」和前面的茫茫大草原後，男女孩子們都去逛廟去了，只有我一個人却被人家限制着，只好在包中呆獃着。「不准去看廟，去了就抓！「在包中，我一個人孤零零地感到了，又是憤怒又是害怕，被這幾個字折磨着我底年青人底心，人家的屁事與我有什麼相干呢？然而，然而！……</p>
<p>就這樣，我在蒙古包中消磨了半日的光景，用讀書打發走了那特別覺得長的時光。如今，回想起來，在蒙古包中讀書，怕是我此後再難得的機會了。</p>
<p>除了被寂寞迫使着大着胆到河東看了看，我便只有在晚間混在男女孩子們中聽了一陣蒙古樂聲和歌唱，也曾隨着男女孩子們到供着「成吉思汗」像的某王公包中看了看。此外，甚·至連蒙古人的騎馬我都沒法去看。</p>
<p>直到第三天早晨離開白靈廟的時候，這位紅麻子科長還向我解釋着，到了這時候，還向我解釋，我那時候真不知他是什麽心理。</p>
<p>再坐着原來的大汽車離開了白靈廟，望着縈古包前　揚着的黄色旗子，我的眼眶子含滿了淚珠。我不是悲哀我受了委曲，帶着悔恨的心歸去。我是在想着我是不是有檢會再到白靈廟來看蒙古風光！那殘酷的現實可會再容許我來嗎？</p>
<p>呵！</p>
<p>在這凄風苦雨的時節，我竟　逢到了這位紅麻子科長，在這氷冷的雨點下，我底心像澆上了油的更燃燒起來，白靈廟的景像又現在我眼前來了。</p>
<p>我曾說過：「為什麽對一個常看見的像歸化舍力圖召式的白靈廟，一定要感覺到未看到的悵惘呢！「如今，我却否定了我底話，那是嚴古風光！而且，在今日，人家還再許我去白靈廟看看嗎？</p>
<p>但突然，我又想到這一位在王道樂土下的王國中享着福的紅麻子科長，如今竟跑向道裏來，想到道裏也有一天會變為「王道樂土」的時候，我的心不禁在冷雨中寒慄起來了。</p>
<h3 id="c183">出走 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 西岑</p>
<p>走，看着－撥撥的隊伍，離開這古老的山城。一瞬眼已竟十月了。</p>
<p>清早起來，往往是走上城墻。漸漸看出四圍的山色，有些處，早由杳遠的綠影，而凝固成一片深藍。這是一點秋的徵象。彷彿那兒有了秋的脚步踐踩，便褪了色了。其實只是山上的樹林落了葉子，再過些日，恐怕這種深藍，又該露出紅或黃的焦灼了。</p>
<p>「出發，出發……」</p>
<p>聽着這樣的命令，從自己指頭下發出去。每次做完了這樣工作，便不免仰在藤背椅上，思索起來。是的，一次：離我們走的日子真的近了。數日來，幾個過於神經質的同伴，都收拾起零碎東西。立刻在這庭院上，處處充滿了凌亂，這上面便帶着十分出發前所有的荒凉了。</p>
<p>山城中，一住將近兩年了。雖然這裏到處是灰影，人們只是裹在灰影下，過着一種刻苦而慘淡的日子。崩潰，破產，就是山中也常常聽到人說起近來的破落了。我不敢想像；把腐瓖的菜葉或樹皮，當做糧食吃的人的臉上，是什麽顏色。所以每次聽到××們在鄕下騷擾的法子，諸如打呀，勒索呀，……我總是很氣憤。猪仔，猪仔，真不是人的生活呵！這裏太灰色，我，有時也企望着遠方了。</p>
<p>真的出發的日期，到了眼前，又不免免　別起來。昨晚還　了兩個同伴跑上城墻去繞彎子看着遠處的山巒，很黯然了。</p>
<p>昨夜，到是露出離別的前夕的滋味。起初是，一黑天，我依然又想去我他們談談天。可是拉遍了每一扇風門，裏面也沒一個人影。</p>
<p>「鬼抓了他們去了……」</p>
<p>結果，我由寂寞而昏沈沈的睡了。後來纔想起，他們一定各自去我各自的野婆娘去了。由這上面，我牽連的想起兩年來所認識清楚了的這塊山地。簡直是一塊土壤，中間沒有－點黏性。以致到處是窮氣。這裏只是一個簡單的山鎮，城圈的大小，雖然不知道究竟多遠，可是每天黃昏，在上面散步一個整圈子，計算起來，也是不會過去半點鐘。然而就這簡陋的小地方，也充滿了黑暗，想起出聲肉體者的慘忍，又不免想起自己出賣靈魂的可憐了</p>
<p>被一種毒液溶化着這裏，在××的壓迫之下，人們是沒有自由來大聲喘氣的。</p>
<p>有一次，便發生了一個非常的事件。是隊伍中的一個小官佐失了踪。結果隔了－天，却在南門外的－片樹林中，尋着他被殺害以後，拋棄在那裏的尸體。上面，有着山中鄕人們鄕　　　　　的　　　　他怎樣壓索。中間當然也穿揷着一點羅曼斯的意味，不過我想說粗暴的肉慾，或者好些。可是這告白，一直被掩藏着，到現在要離開道裏，大槪除了兇手以外，還只有我們自己知道。</p>
<p>一夜的消磨，自然很容易混過去，只要曙光一露面，我們就到了出發的那一天了。</p>
<p>自己住屋的北後，是一片大樹林子。夢中便模糊的聽見。那裏有　子的鈴聲，很輕鬆的；響一下，響一下。另外也有脚步過來過去。可是那更加低啞了。非屏息了喘息是聽不清的。</p>
<p>白色一浸透窗紙。外面人就紛攪起來了，並且說話聲很迅速的掠過去，好像都忙着走路</p>
<p>自己對於出發，除了遵受着，坐在　子背上，離開此地的義務以外，是並沒負一點責任的。所以起來早晚，沒什麽問題。不過瞧着這東西全搬走了，只剩下一兩隻跛脚椅的空屋，也不願多睡了。便也爬起來，看着隨從，把我的行箱，舖，蓋栓牢在事先分派好的分　上，立刻鬆散下來。只等候着出發了的心情，立刻便被山中的早寒很快的掩沒了。看看庭院中心栽的菊花，全被脚　們　　　　了　心中很悽　。便向裏面，拉了兩個好開心，而且也沒有任務的同伴，悄悄走出門去。</p>
<p>大門前冷落極了。沒有一個兵士再給你喊「敬禮」的口號，只在對面街上，立着－堆孩子，睜着驚訝的眼。</p>
<p>我們披着大衣，在早風中往大街上走。終於到了常去喝酒的小酒店。</p>
<p>「最後一次了，夥計……」</p>
<p>三個人，全有着這種心情，互相看了一眼，誰也不言語。店中的小二，大槪對我們今天這樣早的來訪，也有了預料。便毫不猶豫的笑着，招呼着。</p>
<p>我知道，只有今天的笑是真的，也並不是對我們而發的，是對我們今天出發這消息而發的。雖然平日，他們賺着我們的錢。然而××中是矛盾的：越往下，越會倚着灰衣服去作無理的事情。所以，雖然他們一方面歡迎我們給送去的錢，可是另一方面，他又不能不咒惡那為數較多的兄弟了。</p>
<p>喝了酒的人，是不覺得寒冷的，於是我們也不回去，就－直先出南門，去等着他們去。</p>
<p>立在石橋上，望着四面山頂上，一片廟寺的影子很有心往的神情。還是三月開着桃花的時候，在一個例假日子，我們很多的同伴，曾經到那兒做過一次旅行。記得日暮之前，躺在桃花樹下，望着穿揷在亂山間的下山的道路，是作過一次家鄕的冥想的。現在真的走了，向山下去。兩年前來時是霧天。今天，這清秋的山石上，該有着簌簌落葉了。</p>
<p>別的部分的　子隊，有的走過去了。太陽也照紅了半截山，一直照紅了橋下流水，低低的咽哽着。</p>
<p>終於來了。同伴們全笑談着城中的人，燃了鞭砲送行的情形。我回過頭，望望城牆，却兀然立在着，找不出一點熟諳的痕漬。坐到　子上，隨了鈴聲一搖－擺，走上山時，我還想着人們手中的一片鞭砲聲響呢！</p>

<h3 id="c185">波華荔主義 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 芷英</p>
<p>波華荔主義（Bovarism）這個名詞，是高爾齊葉（Jules　de　Gaultter）所創用的。他有一部專門論福羅貝爾（Gu　tave　Faubert）的長篇小說「波華荔夫人」（Madame　Bovary）的著述，其中暢叙個人的波華荔主義及集團的波華荔主義。作為文藝的心理表現形態之一，我們來加以多少的考察，是有充分的意義和新鮮的意味的。</p>
<p>福羅貝爾的「波華荔夫人」，在中國雖然早有譯本的出現，但對於它的注意却並不普遍。在法國，它却是文藝史上的紀念碑的作品。福羅貝爾自己說：「我的可憐的波華荔，現在一定在法國的許多鄕村裏苦惱着，·啜泣着吧。」這話並不是妄言。波華荔夫人是一個特殊的人物，同時又代表着普遍的人類心理。在這部作品裏，浪漫主義和現實主義互相交織着。豐富的想像和逼真的描寫，使它發出了不滅的藝術的豪光。這一點是我們考察波華荔主義之前，所應該知道的。</p>
<p>那末，波華荔主義是什麽呢？</p>
<p>高爾齊葉以為是「把自己認識為自己以外的人物的人類的精神作用「（Le　pouvoir　departia　Phomme　de　se　concevoir　autre　qu＇il　n-＇eit）。</p>
<p>這是特定的歷史階段上的人類的心理機能。那種人物，雖然各有其才能，各有其感覺，各有其思考；但他們總是誤解了其才能，錯用了其感覺，亂施了其思考。他們把自己變形了，把周遭的人物和事物也變形了，結果招來了喜劇·悲劇·和說不上喜劇或悲劇的收場。</p>
<p>容我們把「波華荔夫人」中的兩三個主要人物，拉出來解剖吧。</p>
<p>醫生荷默耶是一個市儈式的市民。他以科學家自居，滿口是學問術語，從古今上下，談到東南西北。他有他自己的偏見，談話的內容，不管別人聽得清楚或聽不清楚。他有很高的虛榮心，把眼糞般大的知識，看成泰山那樣偉大。他信奉現實主義的美學，但由於貴族的趣味，又憎惡現實的卑俗。他一點也不能正確認出自己是什麽，正如他不能正確地認出外界的事物是什麽一樣。然而，在一八五〇年代的法國的卑俗的市民裏，這種人物却為當局所重視，為輿論所擁護了。這是一幅小市民的謔畫，福羅貝爾把他作為俗物主義的小市民典型，而加以辛辣的諷嘲的描寫。醫生荷默葉的「波華荔主義」，是獲得了喜劇的結果的。</p>
<p>此外，莫洛奧却是流俗的市民智識份子的典型的「波華荔主義」的表現者。他有想像力，却沒有行動力。他的想像，是用腕力把對象拉下到自己的水凖來，或是用意力把自己拉上到對象的地位去。他每天都生活在明天裏。在無力中感到焦燥，在焦燥中寄託無力。他誤認了自己的感受性，誤認了自己的智能。他以為他很能理解藝術，儘想做詩人·小說家·批評家。有時又裝得像哲學家一樣，又時有裝得像歷史家一樣，有時却變成了政治家了。他是一個沒有喜劇，沒有悲劇的人生行為的平凡的俗物，即福羅貝爾所說的「乾果」（Fruite　secs）。</p>
<p>波華荔夫人是「波華荔主義」的最集中的表現。她是鄕間的醫生的妻子，懷着羅漫蒂克的夢想，然而又亳無能力。她對於自己的認識完全是錯誤的。她常常幻想她是浪漫小說中的主人公，但實際上她被那平凡的現實所纏繞着。由於對于自己認識的錯誤，她必然地非把外界的事物，加以變形不可。</p>
<p>「她的生涯是一切錯覺的連續。首先，是對於自己的錯覺，其次，是對於他人的錯覺，接下去，是對於場所的錯覺，對於時間的錯覺。這些錯覺在詳細上看來，都是對於自己的錯覺之不可避的所產。即波華荔主義的必然產物。」</p>
<p>這一段話是波華荔主義的極好的註脚。</p>
<p>我們一看波華荔夫人的全生涯，確實是錯覺的悲喜劇。她不滿於凡俗的丈夫，誤認了理想的愛人，沉醉於宗教的虛悅，墮落於肉慾的享受。但這一切都賜給她以幻滅的苦惱。事物越是接近她，她的思潮便越離開它。就在這樣的錯覺的連續下，她－刻刻地把生命消磨盡了，終於踏上了必然的悲劇的道路。</p>
<p>像這樣的波華荔主義，有些論者以為是「存在於一切的時代和環境裏的人類中間的一種機能。」這種論斷是尚有考慮的餘地的。固然，我們可以說，波華荔主義和中國的阿Q精神，有着一些類似的地方；然而，由于環境的不同，這兩種東西却是隔着重大的差別的。甚至在總體上看來，幾乎是全然不同的東西。它們之間的類似點，是同一生活在「幻想」的世界裏，然而，阿Q的「理想」，是奴才的理想；波華荔的「理想」，是小市民的理想。</p>
<p>福羅貝爾自己說過：「波華荔夫人是我自己。」這並不是開玩笑的說法。福羅貝爾對於市民社會的生活，是極端厭惡的。在那樣的社會裏，一切都是平凡的，庸俗的，貪婪的，自私的。人們都被一條無形的金錢的絲，拽往卑鄙的路上走，人們就像金錢的傀儡一樣，一切都是「不由自主的」發展下去。福羅貝爾雖然說：「我在這小說中一點也沒有滲進我的感情和生活去。」但這是不正確的，他自己就打了自己的嘴巴，如次地說：「藝術家在他的作品　，恰如神在創造之中一樣。眼雖不能見，而非有全能的力不可。他的存在雖到處可以感到，而其形姿非不現出不可。」因此，我們有確信可以認為波華荔夫人的靈魂，是滲透着福羅貝爾的精神的。他藉此來評判他的時代社會，評判他自己。</p>
<p>據說西曼提斯（Cervantes）在臨終的時候，有人問他「店·吉珂德」中所寫的是什麽人，他回答道：「那是我。」這和福羅貝爾說「波華荔夫人是我」的話，是同一個模型的。福羅貝爾之喜歡西曼提斯，那原因恐怕應該在道裏去找尋吧。唐·吉珂德不也是厭惡俗界，充滿着羅漫蒂克的熱情和理想麽？這和波華荔夫人，是多麽的類似！</p>
<p>這樣，我們把唐·吉珂德·阿Q·波華荔夫人排列起來，是僥有興趣的。他們都是不同的歷史階段上的三個「偉大的」人物！有一根孫，把他聯繫了起來。但是，這樣的東西，真的應該在「一切的時代和環境裏」存在麽？如果我們相信歷史是人類造成的，那末我可以簡　地回答：絕對不能！</p>

<p>— 高爾基</p>
<p>七月間某一天的中午的太陽，在黃銅色的天際猛烈的燃燒。這小城在蒸熱中發昏，偶爾為糢糊凌亂的響動所攪擾，但立刻啞靜下來沉埋到寂靜裏面。有－種做作的帶鼻腔的聲音，却憂鬱的拖長的送出這樣的歌：</p>
<p>（越過銀白色的江河，</p>
<p>跨到金黃色的沙漠，</p>
<p>我追尋着一個——</p>
<p>年青女人的行踪……）</p>
<p>另一種深沉的口聲刻薄的問道：</p>
<p>「今天早上幹了一些什麽事？」</p>
<p>「幹了一些射擊的事。」</p>
<p>「多少？」</p>
<p>「三個。」</p>
<p>「他們嚕囌什麽沒有？」</p>
<p>「他們為什麽要嚕囌？」</p>
<p>「你是說他們全沒有作聲嗎？」</p>
<p>「全沒有作聲。他們照例都很倔强痛快，……他們全受過訓練，你知道，在他們以為縱然有一朝受到苦難——這筆賬遲早必須清算。」</p>
<p>『是了不起的人嗎？』</p>
<p>「不，——至少在我看來以為不是。他們是在那種蹩脚的地方鬼混的，因此我的猜測以為他們是沒有什麽了不起的人。」</p>
<p>寂靜了一會，於是那做作的聲音繼續悲切的唱：</p>
<p>（皎潔的月亮，</p>
<p>是我的嚮導……）</p>
<p>「你也射擊了嗎？」</p>
<p>「我為什麼不？」</p>
<p>（告訴我，</p>
<p>「她藏在哪兒噢……」</p>
<p>深沉的口聲嘲笑道：</p>
<p>「你這人，還唱什麽「年青的女人，」你還不得不目己縫補襯衫，洽如……你這混賬東西！」</p>
<p>「你等一下，到時候年青女人也會來的。一切都要來的……」</p>

<p>— 李三郎</p>
<p>被扔進陰暗而悶臭的艙里，回頭望望那高高的摩天樓，那幌搖着的椰子樹，好像在送着被驅逐出境的流浪人似的</p>
<p>沒有朋友送我，只有那托着槍的人押我上了船，這樣，我就離開了星加坡了。</p>
<p>要經七天的海程，暈昏昏地躱在艙里，想嘔，口渴得要命，就好像一個生過了病的人一樣。所受到伙計的惡罵，然而，我沒有聽到似地，只幻夢地念着我的祖國，那可憐的祖國演變得怎樣呢！</p>
<p>然而，我很害怕，如果自己患了那可惡的毛病，就像死人似地被拋進了無邊無際的海濤里去，使我時時刻刻壓着自己底痛苦，別像那些少爺式或太太似的呻吟着——我要重見我的祖國呵。</p>
<p>一個早上，在祖國的海面，我可以看到那遠遠的山峯，漸漸兒的顯露出那微小的洋房，山上，海濱，綠色的輪廓，在綠的海水和蔚藍色的天空底下的朝霞間出現了。</p>
<p>「可是那還不是祖國呵，却是封鎖了我國門戶的香港！」</p>
<p>然而，我愛那碧綠的山峯，那美麗的影子又出現在我的眼睛里了。當船慢慢地駛進了港口的時候，那雲霞在綠的峯頂上奔走着，兩座高山對立在峽形的港水間，美麗的房子，很齊整地巖開着，一級一級的高疊着，一直到那還沒有消散的雪霄里。——這是歐洲搬到中國來的都市吧？那冒着煙的海濱，不是擠滿了大大小小的火船嗎？也許比上海還要熱鬧呀！那兒滿是苦力們，像飢餓的猫似的在移動着呢。那一排一列的摩天樓的大銀行，酒家，百貨公司，比星加坡還要繁華哪。</p>
<p>我深深地透了一口氣，所看到的，跟在南島的時候差不多，可是，沒有了那叢密的綠葉樹，有的是比猫追尋老鼠還要厲害的眼睛，在這失了自由的身上釘着。</p>
<p>船快要到碼頭的時候，從星加坡押到香港來的一個印度鬼子又把我交代給這兒的督察員了。</p>

<p>那胖豬似的中國人，長嘴巴了抿了－抿，跟那個英國人一邊說着，一邊從我的身上掃射着，看看公文，那公文上是寫着我的罪狀呀！……他們用猫似的眼睛瞪着我，搜過我的身，我沒有響，咬着牙根的瞪着他們身上的襟章。</p>
<p>那－切的舉動，都使我的心胸加緊地跳躍着，沸騰着的火，我恨不能燒掉他們的奸笑的臉。</p>
<p>一直等到一隻小小的電船來接我的時候，我才被拐進了向內地去的一隻火船。</p>
<p>我那沒有自由的身體，又躱在陰暗的角落里，悄悄地等候祖國所給與我的待遇。</p>

<h3 id="c188">廣州的服裝問題 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 閑</p>
<p>服裝問題自國民政府成立以來，還是沿襲滿清舊制。未曾加以改革，改正基礎，現在的國家，以武力為前提，則服裝之改革，尤其必要，蓋一則欲表演文明之色彩，一則欲表演尙武之精神，處此弱肉強食之世界，文弱的國家，已無生存的餘地，世界上的帝國主義者，早已明白告訴我們。</p>
<p>近據廣州電訊，警察連日在劇院與娛樂塲，査視婦女之衣服，是吾合於當局所開之標準，違者押至警署處罰，按照新章，婦女衣服，均須過膝過肘，且須掩護其頸，惟對於長袖一條，因廣州婦女恊會之呈請，已允修改矣，廣州的衣服問題，前於本刋中，已有人論列，然僅有籠統的反對，而未有澈底的研討也。民元以來，男子長袍馬褂，或西裝革履，毫未變更，而女服則花樣翻新，陸離光怪，幾乎天天在那裏改變，加以限制，固未始不可。惟廣州標準衣服，均須過膝過肘，且須掩護其頸，未免可笑，婦人之頸，和男子之頸，原屬相同，有何特別寶貴之處，而必須掩護，此其可怪者一·女子短袖，不僅表示肉體之豐美，盡爲出風頭問題，而操作之便利，亦其原因之一，反對短袖，義何所取，此其可怪者二。至於衣服過膝，更難索解，現在無論男女，衣服均應取便科與省料主義，若使女子貞潔，過膝可，不過膝亦可，女子而不貞潔，過膝非，不過膝亦非，豈不過膝可以那個那個，而過膝不可以那個那個耶。</p>
<p>惟短袖之制，在江浙及北方各地方可以嚴禁，而廣州倒可不必，此何以故，氣候殊也，北方天氣寒冷，女子短袖，往往凍得紅裏泛紫，紫裏泛青，甚至生成凍瘡，對於衛生，亦有妨碍，故在隆冬時可禁，而在春夏時亦可不禁，至於廣州，則天氣四時和暖，若使嚴禁，固屬毫無意義也。總之。男女之衣服，在現在時期，要當趨於便利，而能表演尙武的精神為貴，若反此原則而一味以妖艷淫態為主，或以古時禮教為主。均屬無所取義矣。</p>
<p>至於男子服裝，在本刋中，前年已經多數人士加以討論，大抵　張　除長袍馬褂，而制定一種輕便而簡單之服裝，一般的主張，均以對襟而長僅及膝者爲度，因爲長袍馬褂，非但完全表演文弱態度，於精神上亦多一種消極氣象，且於步履亦極不便，至於西裝革履，雖較神氣，但其著衣，亦極累墜之至，并且一國的人民，自有一國的衣服，何必定要學西人之皮毛耶，現在廣州當局，擬嚴禁學生西裝，本無不可，惟僅僅嚴禁學生西裝，而不嚴禁其他人民西裝，此是何故，眞令人百思而不解者矣。</p>
<h3 id="c189">四等艙里 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>在這龐大的大海船中，我用了五十六塊錢換來了這五尺見方的地位。四等船艙永遠是沒有陽光的，而在這炎夏的六月天，外面的海風在呼嘯着，但這里却沒有一絲的風。旁邊是機器間，它向這些卑賤的四等艙客，播散着難以忍受的熱氣。空氣像一塊凝固了的鋁，我們連呼吸的權利也被剝奪了。</p>
<p>從新嘉坡下船之後，我的腦袋便像有人用一把針不住地刺着一般，又昏亂，又刺痛，連睡覺也不成。席下却是一片黑黏黏的鋼板，百足蟲時時爬到我的席邊，一搗死它，滿腹的汚血就呌人作嘔。</p>
<p>我無時不在咀咒着金錢，尤其是聽到上面那低低的音樂的時候。我幻想着那高貴的紳士們在上過蠟的光滑的地板上，漫舞着，低唱着，打發過這印度洋上的六月的黃昏。</p>
<p>但是在這樣的船艙里，却有人是那麼豪興。在那邊，四個人正在叉着麻將，在近處又有五七個人在開着番攤，也有人在捫紙牌。吆吆叱叱的聲音有時更壓過機軸的巨聲。他們全身赤裸着，只圍一條浴巾，在背上，胸前，額角，汗像小流一樣的掛下來，但他們却聚精會神，同不可知的賭運搏鬥着。在對過的吊舖上，一個中年的婦人伴着一支小油燈，那朵小小的紅色的火焰給靑白色的煙罩着顯得更加微弱了。在這橫豎不過四丈見方的小艙里，欺騙，自私，淫猥同頹廢的人性却跟着熱氣與腥穢的氣味一樣盈溢着。</p>
<p>開船的第三天，査了船票之後，這小艙里又添了二個人，他們被綑在一支鐵柱上。女的上衫被撕碎了，男的背上同腿上有着一條條的鞭痕，乾了的血跡像一條條粗的紅線，從額上肩上同胸上，腿肚子上流下來。他們起初還想掙扎，還哀哀地哭着。二三個時辰之後，他們便一聲不響了，埋着頭，像一個接續走了幾萬里長途的旅人那樣疲憊，那樣衰弱。</p>
<p>「到唐山也要半個月，偸得成也要餓死的。」一個老人這樣說。「我這條水路至少也走上十來回了，沒有一回有一個人偸得成的。偸得過麼？咳，連生命也不要的……」他歎了一口氣，像沉在可怕的回憶里一樣。從他的話里，我才知道他們在船末開之前便偸藏在貨艙里，他們一直就沒有睡覺，也沒有飯吃，也沒有水喝，恰在査票的那一天偸偷的爬上來，這樣就被找到了。</p>
<p>「船長要把他們扔落海里，好險呵！」老人說後逕自走了。</p>
<p>我望着這夫婦倆，他們像二個沒有骨頭的人，軟軟地垂着上身。</p>
<p>在他們的旁邊，叉麻將的人還是那樣高興，大聲地嚷着，叱着，似乎背後沒有兩個正在遭難的同胞一樣。我心里似乎給什麼有力的東西壓住了一般，差一點兒昏暈了去。</p>
<p>「老伯伯，得代他們想點法子，這樣還能熬過今夜麼？一點點水也沒喝過。」</p>
<p>在艙門口，兩個唐山人的水手探進頭來，似乎在搜索着什麼。里面四支昏暗的燈光使他們看不淸楚要找的東西，於是一個踏入艙來。</p>
<p>「老鄉，救救他們吧，差不多要死了，他們。」我用手指着那兩個被綑縛的人這樣說，聲音像一個病人。</p>
<p>那水手用手招了招那艙門口的同伴，於是有三個人跑了進來，他們大着步子走過去，用手死命的解那個大結。</p>
<p>「你們放了他，船長來問，不關我們的事。」一個瘦臉子的人這樣說，用手抹着額前的汗。是一個駝背的人。</p>
<p>「丟那媽，你是什麼東西！不要臉，你是中國人！」一個水手上前一步，還沒有用手推他，他已經退後了三四步。他悄悄地退到那個角落里，戰顫地坐下去，膽怯着望着那騷動的人們。</p>
<p>在這兩個受難者的面前是一堆白飯同鹹菜，也有一隻削好皮的波羅。人們用憐憫的眼光望着他們。女的低着頭，呆呆地拖着飯碗，一口飯許久許久還咽不下去。她的兩肩利害地抽搐着，從深凹下去的眼眶里，感激的淚流斷了線的珠兒一樣的掉下來了。</p>
<p>這一夜，我開始合上疲怠的眼皮，但半夜驟然又醒來了。外面海濤的聲在咆哮着。我聽着水聲到了天光，一直沒合過眼。</p>
<h3 id="c190">枇杷 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 夏理斯</p>
<p>天氣熱起來了，使我想起要是在故鄕，那又是枇杷上市的時節。這南國所特有的菜子是會教人懷戀的；何况我的姑母家里是有着菓園的呢？</p>
<p>那是一個很大的菜園。每一次到姑母家去，表姊都會帶我去里邊看看有什麼菓子成熟了沒有。在柚子，龍眼，荔枝各種菓子里，我喜歡了枇杷。而那菓園里的枇杷樹也特別多。從園門口的籬笆走了進去，看見滿樹的枇杷，我就非常興奮，拖着表姊的手「枇杷熟了！枇杷熟了！」不停地呌着。於是，我爬在樹上，表姊提着籃子站在下面，一大把的枇杷就裝滿了一籃。想着可以吃一個飽了，就快活得老在樹上呌，急得表姊在下面催；同時又恐怕我一不小心跌了下來。</p>
<p>把枇杷拿到天井裏，吃過了晚飯，凉風吹着，我們四五個人團團地圍坐在一塊兒，開始一邊吃，一邊談話。姑母是善於說話的婦人，她和我的母親好像有着說不完的話似地，常常說到我們想睡覺的時候。有一次我坐在旁邊聽見姑母說到她的家况一年不如一年了，自從姑父死去，漸漸地借上了許多債，菓園作了抵押。自然，這麼下去有一天這菓園會成爲人家所有的；那時我是再也沒有爬上枇杷樹去的幸福了。</p>
<p>吃多了枇杷，因而生病的事，也曾經有過。姑母老遠地看我，用一種溫柔撫慰我，還說枇杷還多得很，只要病一</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>好，就可以到她那里去。我躺在床上，報以感激的微笑。想問她表姊爲什麼沒有來，終於說不出口。</p>
<p>病一好，又上姑母家去了。母親可嚀着不許再過分的貪嘴，我點頭答應了她。這一次我眞的有點怕再生一次病，所以祇和表姊在菓園里玩。我們留連不忍他去，直到黃昏來到的時候。</p>
<p>這其間，我一度離開故鄉，那正是滿樹枇杷的時節。姑母送了我一大籃，一直吃到我要去的地方，還留下不少。於是我又拿來作了送給那里的人的禮物。他們也很愛枇杷，所以很高與；還聽着我講枇杷的故事。這樣的時日消磨得眞快，回到故鄉是深秋了。</p>
<p>凉風吹着我，天上的灰雲顯得很暗淡。在家里停留了一夜，第二天一早我就看姑母和表姊去。到了那里，空氣有點兩樣，姑母雖然笑着招待我，臉上却似乎有什麼心事，無論如何是不能掩飾的。表姊的神氣很憂鬱，儘是低頭不語。我約她上菓園里去看看；她像有點爲難的樣子，却又不拒絕我。這樣，我們推開那籬笆，午後的陽光從樹葉隙里穿在泥土上，花紋一樣地鋪在上面。深秋的風吹動着葉子，沙沙地響。一片片的黃葉子凋殘了，飄落下來；看上去菓園的情景是很悲戚的。</p>
<p>是的，過後我才知道這菓園已經易主，不再是我姑母的了。破落家庭的悲哀我那時還沒有切身的感受：我祗覺到第二年的枇杷上市時節，是沒有一籃又一籃的枇杷可吃了。</p>
<p>故鄉的一切都是不堪回首的。現在的情形又怎樣了？不能忘記的是那豐富的菓園，熟了的枇杷，和姑母一家人的面影……</p>
<h3 id="c191">貓 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>燈熄了，就看得見掛在窓外天角上的月亮，圓圓的，亮亮的，像一個天眞的少女帶着嬌羞的風情，遠遠的站在那兒，偸偸望着窓內的人。在這樣溫柔美妙的中夜，原當好好安然入睡。有許多美麗的夢兒在等着我呢。當我想到這句話，就聽到　　　貓的呌聲：我知道這是那隻常常在窓前樓墻上看到的花白貓，又許是從什麼地方碰到失意的事情跳到牆頭來自怨自艾了。這樣的情形好久以來就引起我的關心，我心下想，這隻貓一定有着牠的無處可訴的不幸的遭際；因爲鄰近的屋瓦上，夜裏也有別隻貓兒走來鬧着擾人淸夢的風流韻事，這可以從牠們熱辣辣的呌聲分辨出來。而這隻貓，對于牠的那些同類們鬧的事情，可像不大關心似的，長是拖着失意的尾巴，悄悄的走來，又悄悄的走開，寂寞地做着與世無爭，與世無關的夜的巡邏者？這　爾之地的牆頭上，就像是牠唯一的歇息地了。寂寞的貓啊。</p>
<p>，牠又這麼寂寞地呌起來了，聽來就好像正對着我的樓窓。我想牠也許知道這六扇洞開的樓窓之內，有着我這個人還在不寐的中夜，聽到牠的呌聲而關心牠的一切吧。我相信牠也早經認識我了，因為日裏聽有幾趙看到牠從什麼地方跳到牆上來；碰着我正凭着窓口，牠就會昂起圓圓的頭，睜着悽靜的眼睛和我打上幾次照面，牠的神情好像對什麼事物都充滿懷疑，又很淡漠的樣子，對于我也是這麼看待，沒有驚慮，也沒有表示討求親嫟的意思。牠來了，就蹲在牆頭上，舉起脚抓洗洗臉，望望樓角那邊甩着尾巴跳着的雀子，出一回神；有時天空忽然飛過一陣嚶嚶的鴿鈴，或一隻什麼鳥兒的黑影在牠面前掠過去，就聳動着兩隻耳朶，眼瞪瞪的向空四望，這時候，牠的神情也變得靈活起來了。牠的眼睛也就會碰到正向牠注視的我的眼睛，頓時彼此好像觸着了友誼的默契似的，　，聲音是這麼輕盈平和的送了上來，我心裏就莫名地感到一種喜悅。</p>
<p>是誰家的貓呢。常常會這樣問自己。看牠的神情，又極像一隻無家可依的棄貓，然縱使有家，牠的主人待牠也一定不會如何關心憐愛。若果我這推想會不錯的話，那麼牠的生涯中受人欺負的事情當無可避免了。同類間的冷視，狗兒的欺凌，女傭手裏的無情的掃把，而至以野孩子的作惡，這些不幸的打擊，卽將成爲日常生活中不會欠缺的遭遇，牠除了爲應付這些頭痛事情而疲于奔命打發日子，剩下來的一些短短的時間，而反是經過了思索後的無處可訴的人性的寂寞呵。這蕞爾之地的牆頭豈又是牠安息遊樂所在麼？不！牠究竟是一隻失意的貓啊。人獸之間的距離這麼懸殊，我縱關心牠，也無法用我的言語來消除這隔膜的，更不必說我能給牠的與撫愛了。</p>
<p>想到這裏就披衣起來了，我自然看見牠，幽亮的月光下，更顯出寂寞的模樣。也許是意外的喜悅吧，　，又　麼柔馴地呌了一聲，我能用什麼口語來回問她呢？這可憐的貓。于是我就想起童話裹會說話的貓，假使牠也會說人話，或者我會說貓話，不特我可以表達出心中的同情，安慰牠，鼓勵牠。在這不寐的中夜，彼此不更可以盡情傾吐蘊儲于胸膈裏的私心話麼？人類也是一樣有着生的寂寞感啊。</p>

<p>— 雷石榆</p>
<p>（四）舞塲</p>
<p>這是很可惜的一件憾事。我不會跳舞，而且沒有學過，甚至連舞塲也沒有進去觀光過。不過我留心聽東京的舞塲很繁盛，如新宿，銀座，淺草等繁華區域特別多宏壯堂皇的舞塲，那些舞塲專做中國留學生的生意似乎很不錯的，「留東新聞」曾揭載過一個驚人的統計，留學生們在那裏耗費的，每月約數萬塊似的。這不用說是留學生中的官僚子弟和布爾的公子哥兒的一種玩意的耗費。</p>
<p>當我在某補習學校讀日文的時候，我前席的某君是最善於跳舞的，他說他每夜差不多跳一二塊錢。他是資本家的兒子，他在法國「留」過二年多的，因爲花錢太多，他父親要他轉學到日本來，幸而日本的生活程度不高，跳舞更比上海便宜得多，似乎是一塊購得比上海一般的多半倍以上的票子，所以他也很寫意的生活下去。他上課時，你隨便呌他可以掏出十把張出來。但不知怎樣的，那時我對跳舞這興味却沒有一點感動，連去「觀光」這意慾也抬不起頭來。</p>
<p>去年日本報紙上曾揭載當局下令嚴禁學生進舞塲和咖啡店的，但那條件是多麼有利，只是不准穿制服進去。窮學生只一二套制服，但有錢的學生，他的各種各樣的漂亮西裝不好穿嗎？</p>
<p>舞女和咖啡女恐怖着生活會遭到可憐的倒霉，於是各派代表向當局交涉過，結果怎樣我不明白。但不久，咖啡店的門上貼着招徠學生光臨的字條，不用說，舞塲也一樣如流吧。那麼這一回官樣文章便算浪費一番精神和工夫。不過，這是裝飾「道德」的，「禮節」的。這裝飾對牠本身無害，對我們的中國學生更沒絲毫損傷。一方藉這樣的裝飾搖擺一下尊餒的面具而又不影響作爲一部的留學生的耗費，一方那些留學生也依然不被妨碍尋求消遣，那不是兩得其所嗎？</p>

<p>— 白木</p>
<p>瘦皮猿韓蘭根在即將公映之藝華新片「化身姑娘」中是飾一個非常貪嘴，且膽小如鼠的低能兒。一天，他因欲買點化妝品來博取他所喜愛的女朋友的歡心，便硬着頭皮向他父親索討四毛錢了，可是他是父親却是非常嚴肅的，結果他是反討了一場的怒駡。他退出來很無趣地在院子中徘徊了良久，後來心計一轉，便拔起脚步走至其堂弟袁美雲男女（？）的房裏去了。這時袁美雲正靠在沙發上閱展一本「女子生理衛生」的書，看他慌張地走進來，不禁臉紅耳赤，那窘狀是比瘦皮猿在其父親面前受譴責的情態更要可憐的。但瘦皮猿對於袁美雲所看的那本書，並不引爲注意，他起先是好像一個談情的女兒一樣，難爲情了半天，後來總算費盡了九牛　虎之力開口向牠借錢了，袁美雲　　躊躇地問他要多少，他屈了四指意思是借四毛錢，但袁美雲却借給他四塊錢了。這一下瘦皮猿可就喜出望外。於是不一會已是從街上買了許許多多的雪花膏白粉等的化妝品歸來了。</p>
<p>這雖是「化身姑娘」中一段小小的情節，但瘦皮猿的喜怒哀樂無常的尷尬臉孔，袁美雲看「女子生理衛生」被他撞見時的一副窘狀，是足够使人笑得眼淚水汪汪了。</p>

<p>電影演員忠於他的工作，往往有很大的犧牲，這種犧牲，甚至有時危及生命。在演員之外，各種生物的犧牲，當然也很多。</p>
<p>我們記得，幾年前攝製「一剪梅」，曾活活地擊斃一匹馬，前兩月，拍「迷途的羔羊」也曾有一隻犬和二十幾隻小鳥而殞命，在最近，「到自然去」，竟被殺死了一條小鹿。</p>
<p>馬鹿這些東西，固然用金錢可以買得來，然而若不是爲拍戲，牠們是不會就犧牲了性命罷。</p>

On the morning of the 14th, he invited Zhang Ji, Li Wenfan, Fu Bingchang, Ma Chaojun, and others to discuss matters related to the funeral, state funeral, commendation, and compensation, as well as sending senior officials south to assist with the funeral arrangements.

Ye Chucang returned to Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 14th and immediately visited Sun Ke, and together they visited Vice-Chairman Chiang to discuss everything. It is rumored that the central government plans to convene another temporary standing committee meeting on the 16th or 18th to make concrete decisions on various matters.

The Secretariat has forwarded them to Vice-Chairman Chiang's secretary-general and the standing committee members for review. How to select a replacement for Hu's vacant position as Chairman is not yet under consideration. However, the position of Central Executive Committee member will, as usual, be filled by Xue Dubi, an alternate member of the Executive Committee, but this also requires a decision by the plenary session.

<p>A Brief Biography of Mr. Hu Zhantang</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This brief biography of Mr. Hu Hanmin was hastily drafted and may not be entirely detailed. Now, based on materials collected by the Party History Compilation Committee, we have compiled a biography of Mr. Hu as follows: Mr. Hu's given name was Hanmin, his courtesy name was Zhantang, and he was known as the Master of the Bukui Studio. He was born in the 33rd year before the founding of the Republic of China, which is the 5th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, or 1879 AD. He was from Panyu County, Guangdong Province, with ancestral roots in Ji'an, Jiangxi Province. In his early years, he studied in Japan, entering the Kobun Normal School and the Faculty of Law and Politics. Witnessing the perilous state of the country at the time, he developed revolutionary aspirations. After meeting Dr. Sun Yat-sen, he decided to dedicate himself to the revolution. In the 7th year before the founding of the Republic of China (31st year of Guangxu), he joined the Chinese Tongmenghui (United League) as its Secretary-General, in charge of the League's secret documents. When Min Bao (The People's Paper) was published, he served as its chief editor, advocating for revolution with all his might. In the 5th year before the founding of the Republic of China (33rd year of Guangxu), he followed Dr. Sun alone from Japan to Singapore, Saigon, and Hanoi, establishing secret military organs. After the failures of the Huanggang and Zhennanguan uprisings, he presided over the Zhongxing Daily in Singapore, propagating ideology and uniting comrades. He also served as the director of the Southern General Branch in Hong Kong, planning events in Guangdong with Zhao Boxian, Huang Xing, and Ni Yingdian. In the 2nd year before the founding of the Republic of China (2nd year of Xuantong), in the first month, the Guangzhou New Army uprising failed. He followed Dr. Sun to Penang to convene a military conference. He was subsequently ordered to establish a general planning department in Hong Kong. In the year before the founding of the Republic of China (3rd year of Xuantong), on March 29th, the Huanghuagang Uprising failed. He and Huang Xing planned for the aftermath and strategized for another uprising. On October 10th, the Wuchang Uprising succeeded, and Guangdong declared independence. He was elected as the Governor of Guangdong. In December, Dr. Sun returned to China from Europe via Guangdong and ordered him to follow. On January 1, the first year of the Republic of China, Dr. Sun took office as the Provisional President, and he was appointed as the Secretary-General of the Presidential Office. He resigned in April and then went to Guangdong to serve again as the Governor of Guangdong, concurrently as the Civil Affairs Director, and as the Director of the Guangdong Branch of the Tongmenghui. In the same year, Song Jiaoren proposed to change the Tongmenghui to the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party). He strongly declined the position of Director of the Branch but was unsuccessful. In the second year, Yuan Shikai assassinated Song Jiaoren and borrowed 300 million in foreign debt. He and Li Liejun, Tan Yankai, Bai Wenwei, and others sent stern telegrams of protest. When the campaign against Yuan began, he was ordered by Dr. Sun to go to Shanghai. In the third year, Dr. Sun reorganized the Kuomintang into the Chinese Revolutionary Party and personally wrote the oath, making him and Chen Qimei as witnesses. He served as the Minister of Political Affairs of the Headquarters and edited the Republic of China magazine. In the fourth year, he supported Dr. Sun in sending Zhu Zhixin and Deng Zhongyuan to Hong Kong to plan for Guangdong. In the fifth year, he went to Little Luzon to raise funds. Chen Qimei launched an uprising in Shanghai, seized the Zhaohua and killed Zheng Ruicheng, and captured the Jiangyin Fortress. He was ordered by Dr. Sun to go to Shanghai. After Yuan Shikai died and Li Yuanhong succeeded him, he was ordered by Dr. Sun to go to Beijing with Liao Zhongkai to inspect. In the sixth year, Duan Qirui instigated the rebellion of the military governors and dissolved the National Assembly. Dr. Sun ordered him to go to Guangdong and Guangxi to urge the independence of the two provinces. When Zhang Xun restored the monarchy, Dr. Sun led the navy to protect the constitution, and National Assembly members convened in Guangzhou and established the Grand Marshal's Office. He was appointed as the Minister of Communications. Soon after, the Guangdong Provincial Assembly elected him as the Governor of Guangdong, but he declined. In the ninth year, he edited the Construction magazine in Shanghai. In the tenth year, the National Assembly reconvened, and Dr. Sun became the Grand President. He was appointed as the Chief Counselor. When Dr. Sun directed the Northern Expedition from Guilin, he served as the Secretary-General of the Headquarters, concurrently as the Chief of Civil Affairs and Minister of Political Affairs. In the eleventh year, Chen Jiongming opposed the Northern Expedition. He followed Dr. Sun to return to Guangdong, dismissing Chen Jiongming from his post and changing the route to conquer Jiangxi from the North River. After conquering Ganzhou, Chen Jiongming's forces suddenly changed course. Dr. Sun boarded a warship. During the campaign against Chen, he was ordered to stay and guard the Headquarters, immediately advancing with Xu Chongzhi, Zhu Peide, and Li Dengtong to counterattack Shaoguan. In the twelfth year, he was ordered to return to Guangdong and drive out Chen Jiongming, serving as the Governor of Guangdong. Dr. Sun returned to Guangdong and then served as the Chief Counselor of the Headquarters. When the party was reorganized, he was ordered to go to Shanghai with Liao Zhongkai and Wang Jingwei as preparatory members. In the thirteenth year, at the First National Congress, he was elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee and served as the Minister of Organization of the Shanghai Executive Department. When Dr. Sun fell ill, he was ordered to return to Guangdong and served as a Standing Committee member of the Central Executive Committee and a member of the Political Conference. When the merchant corps incident occurred, he was ordered to serve as the Governor of Guangdong, still concurrently serving as the Secretary-General of the Headquarters. When Dr. Sun directed the Northern Expedition, he was left to exercise the powers of the Grand Marshal, and in October, in the name of the Governor of Guangdong, he confiscated the weapons of the merchant corps, and the entire city resumed operations. When Dr. Sun went north, he授以北伐及征東江方略、代理政治會議主席、及軍事委員會主席、十四年東征、黨軍及粵軍已定潮汕、總理薨於北平、旣而滇桂軍謀變、其重兵皆在省垣附近、乃移大本營於河南檄調黨軍粵軍、與譚延闠朱培德等之師討平之、改組國府、任政府常委、兼任外交部長、仍代理政治會議主席、九月奉中央執委會令、前往蘇俄、十五年二决全國代表大會、仍被舉爲中央執行委員、復被選爲常委、兼政治會議委員、四月歸國以病居滬、十六年革命軍克復東南、與中委蔣介石·吳稚暉、諸同志、定計淸黨·定都南京、被推爲中央宣傳部長、政治會議主席、及國府主席、軍委會常委、更與中委蔣介石·吳稚暉·諸同志、去職離京、十七年以國府命、與孫科·伍朝樞、往歐考察、八月回國、任國府委員、兼立法院長、十八年第三决全國代表大會、被舉爲中央執行委員、第一次執行委員會、推爲常委、並爲政治會議委員、仍兼立法院長、二月二十八日去職、二十年第四决全國代表大會、仍被選爲中央執行委員、復被推爲常委、兼中政會常委、二十年十月十四日離京赴滬、十一月復離滬赴粵、同月當選爲四屆中央執行委員、一中全會開會、復被選爲國府委員及中政會常委、以體弱多病、留港調治、對國事仍極關懷、二十四年六月、赴歐洲考察、旋赴法國南部休養、十一月五全大會、被選爲中央執行委員、十二月一中全會、選爲常委兼主席、在法接全會主席團電促回國、卽由法起程、於本年一月十九日返抵港、中央復推派居正·葉楚傖·陳策·南卜迎迓、因健康未全復、體弱畏寒、未及北上、卽留粵養疴、五月十二日下午七時四十分、凈以腦充血症遽爾逝世、享年五十八歲、生平對革命著述極富、均已行世、善詩文、著有不匱室詩鈔、夫人陳淑子、女公子木蘭、均能克承遺志焉、（十四日中央社電）</p>

<h3 id="e2">The Launch of the Summer Hygiene Campaign <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>The New Life Movement Promotion Association recently drafted an outline of the summer hygiene campaign work plan and distributed it to various associations, requiring them to start a large-scale summer hygiene campaign from the 20th of this month. The municipal health authorities have also decided to advance the date and start a citywide mobilization today to prevent the spread of epidemic atmosphere and protect the well-being of society. Its significance is profound and cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that epidemics often occur in the hot season. The painful impressions of the past are enough to serve as a warning to future generations. Thanks to the development of social consciousness and the widespread adoption of artificial immunization methods, the epidemic situation in cities in recent years has indeed been suppressed compared to the past. Therefore, to avoid this catastrophe, it is best to start by addressing the root causes, rather than waiting until the situation is dire. Examining the epidemics of summer and autumn, cholera, typhoid fever, and dysentery are usually the most common. These three types all belong to the gastrointestinal category. Although the momentum is dangerous, prevention and control are still not very difficult. As the saying goes, "Illness enters through the mouth, prevention depends on the mouth." If we can strictly maintain vigilance against what enters the mouth, we can avoid the invasion of bacteria from beginning to end. However, given the complexity of our daily life environment and the breadth of its implications, how can we ensure prevention and how can we avoid infection? It requires everyone's joint effort to lift it up, and individual efforts alone cannot succeed. This is why we need the collective action of various organizations.</p>
<p>This resolution's outline of the summer hygiene campaign plan lists the New Life Movement Associations, government party departments, health agencies, police agencies, military agencies, educational agencies, and mass organizations as the organizational backbone. Its work guidelines, such as conducting major cleanups, carrying out house-to-house fly and mosquito extermination guidance, conducting water source disinfection, conducting hygiene guidance in public places, conducting hygiene exhibitions, conducting immunization injections, and prohibiting spitting and defecating everywhere, are concise, practical, and not empty words or vain hopes. At the same time, it stipulates that personnel should receive appropriate training and be given the necessary knowledge, which is also an indispensable step. Broadly speaking, the key to promoting hygiene in today's situation is nothing more than four points: first, promoting the benefits and harms; second, guiding methods; third, providing materials; and fourth, punishing the stubborn. Due to the isolation of social conditions and the vast differences in inherited customs, it is very difficult for the people's will to be consistent. Some are ignorant and foolish, placing benefits and harms beyond their awareness, while others are sloppy and follow the old ways, entrusting their fate to chance. Even among those who are enlightened, they know the necessity of disinfection, but due to limited knowledge and a lack of supplies, they still feel at a loss. Therefore, with the help of various organizations, we should make multifaceted efforts and devote our modest efforts to the best of our ability. Doctors should provide guidance on hygiene, pharmaceutical companies should supply disinfection materials, newspapers should fulfill their responsibility to publicize, and the military and police should implement compulsory sanctions. In the matter of seeking public safety, we should all be willing to do our utmost, and we should not cut our feet to fit the shoes just because of the inconvenience of a few people.</p>
<p>Summer is a dreadful season, and epidemic prevention is essential to saving lives. The facts have shown that it is easy to inspire hearing and vision, and the efforts of the masses will surely have a significant effect. From this, we can establish the foundation of the hygiene movement, spur the improvement of general society, and then seek the revival of the entire nation. I will take the summer hygiene campaign as the starting point.</p>
<h3 id="e3">North China Smuggling: Japan's Reply to British Inquiry Increases Anxiety; Japan Refuses to Undertake Collaborative Anti-Smuggling Plan; Annual Meeting of the London Chinese Labour Union Discusses the Matter <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(London) Reuters has learned that the Japanese government's response to British Ambassador Clive's inquiry on May 1 regarding smuggling in North China does not in any way alleviate British anxiety about the matter. It is reported that the Japanese government has refused to undertake a plan to assist in implementing measures to prevent smuggling. Here, there is growing alarm over the increasingly serious problem of smuggling. A telegram sent today by Reuters' Shanghai correspondent has attracted significant attention from all parties. The telegram quotes Mr. Meyer, a Chinese customs officer, as saying that organized smuggling in North China will inevitably affect reparations and debts secured by customs duties. Moreover, customs duties collected in Shanghai and North China ports account for 88% of the total annual customs revenue, so the problem is no longer a purely domestic matter but an international one. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the issue of smuggling in northern China, the British government called the attention of the Japanese government to the matter on the 2nd of this month, stating that the Chinese customs authorities had been unable to take appropriate steps to stop smuggling because Japanese troops were stationed there. The Japanese government subsequently submitted a response on the 5th of this month, stating that Japan had not encouraged smuggling and had also suffered losses. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office recently stated that the British government did not consider this answer satisfactory and would request further clarification. Foreign Office sources also said that since the occurrence of smuggling, China's customs revenue had suffered a loss of 120,000 pounds sterling per month, and the interests of European bondholders, whose foreign debts were secured by customs duties, had been seriously affected. (14th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) At today's annual meeting of the Chinese Public Association, Chairman Mr. Pannard gave an earnest speech reflecting the opinions and actions of Londoners regarding Japan's attitude and actions regarding smuggling in North China. Mr. Pei referred to the relationship between China and Japan, saying that the people neither underestimated the many difficulties in Japan's policy towards China, nor failed to understand them, but the people really had to criticize Japan's policy and the means used to promote this policy, partly because this difficulty could not be resolved by it, and partly because it had now caused all kinds of serious new problems, making China and the people suffer together. What the people opposed most was the Japanese people's disregard for the actions of the Chinese customs authorities in North China. I can at least cite one kind of goods, because they were smuggled into China from Dalian, the sales of this item in the Yangtze River basin in Britain have been greatly reduced. The Japanese authorities claim that they are not responsible for smuggling. It should be known that due to the attitude of the Japanese authorities in dealing with the Chinese customs, the actions of the Tianjin Chinese customs authorities in dealing with smugglers are now greatly hindered. This is an obvious fact. At the end of his speech, Mr. Pei highly praised the Chinese government's significant efforts in national construction and its success in dealing with the currency issue. After Mr. Pei's speech, Lord Winterton was re-elected as the president of the association. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Legislator Says It Greatly Damages Japan's Dignity</p>
<p>(Tokyo) During today's discussion in the Lower House on the issue of smuggling in North China, a certain legislator from the Seiyukai stated that rampant smuggling in northern Zhili (Hebei) with Dalian as its base, although caused by China's high tariffs, greatly damages Japan's dignity. He wondered whether the government had taken any action against the Nanjing government regarding this matter. Foreign Minister Arita replied that the government had adopted necessary measures, but the matter was also due to the negligence of the Chinese local authorities. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Jiji Shinpo newspaper reported today that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, in response to a suggestion in the Diet that the Foreign Ministry should investigate the truth of rumors of smuggling in North China, said that the United States and Britain were now paying attention to this situation, and there was no reason why Japan should not do the same. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Suggestions to the Central Government on Anti-Smuggling Adjustment Measures</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The authorities have decided to suggest to the central government the points of the North China Anti-Smuggling Adjustment Measures. In the afternoon of the 14th, Nishida, the vice-consul of Tianjin, visited Xiao again to protest about the seizure of five smuggling cargo ships by the Tianjin Customs and demanded their return. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Lin Shize will go to Beijing next week to continue discussing the problem of anti-smuggling in North China with the Ministry of Finance. Xiao expressed that the remedial measures for anti-smuggling that he drafted will be implemented after the Ministry of Finance approves them. Yun Ri has been exchanging opinions with the Ministry of Finance through continuous correspondence on this matter, but he is still unable to understand thoroughly and has decided to ask Lin Shize to go to Beijing to report in person. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) As smuggling spreads, foreign companies in Tianjin are hiring ronin (masterless samurai) to transport their goods without paying regular taxes. Other foreign firms are also hiring White Russians and ronin to smuggle. Recently, the Tianjin-Qinhuangdao Customs has become like a dam that has burst its banks, with a flood of smuggled goods. The ronin are both intimidating and open about it, and the Customs is intimidated and does not dare to seriously investigate and confiscate. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Party and government circles held a joint meeting at the county party headquarters this afternoon to discuss the prevention of smuggling in North China. It was decided that businesses should be strictly prohibited from transporting and selling smuggled goods, and banks should refuse to provide mortgages. A notice has been issued to all industries to comply. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e6">League of Nations Administrative Council Resolves to Increase China's Council Seat, with a Term of Three Years, Final Decision by the General Assembly in September <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council held an open meeting today to discuss the issue of China's request for a seat on the Administrative Council. It was approved and resolved to submit it to the League of Nations General Assembly for review in September, and then make a final decision. After the meeting today, Foreign Minister Eden, as chairman, first presented the report of the Administrative Council Committee (i.e., the one that reviews the allocation of Council seats) and read it aloud. This report should have been read by the chairman of the committee, i.e., the Italian representative. However, the entire delegation of that country had returned home, so Foreign Minister Eden read it on his behalf. The report stated that the committee agreed to temporarily add two non-permanent Council seats, from September 1936 to September 1939. One would be given to a European country that does not belong to any group. This seat was added in 1933 and is currently held by Portugal. It should continue to be maintained for the next three years. The other seat should be given to a country on the Asian continent. In the committee's view, it could be given to China. The above method should be decided by the Administrative Council after review by the League of Nations General Assembly. After Eden finished reading the report, Portuguese representative Vasconcelos stood up and spoke, saying that the method proposed by the committee was unfair. Among the member states of the League of Nations, Asian countries account for only five, while European countries that do not belong to any group total fourteen. According to the method proposed by the committee, Asian countries will occupy two non-permanent Council seats, while European countries that do not belong to any group will only occupy one seat. How can this be called fair? However, he did not oppose China obtaining a non-permanent Council seat. Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü argued that the term of the newly added non-permanent Council seat should be set at three years. Roma is a foreign minister,　　　　　　　　Cheng took the Council seat　to give to China, and said that for European countries that do not belong to any group, the term of their Council seat should be less than three years. Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov also expressed his support for China's request and argued that the term of European non-permanent Council seats should be limited to one year. Eden then said that the Administrative Council should not make any decision on the issue of the term of the Council seat. The report submitted by the committee and the opinions of the representatives of various countries should be submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly for processing. The Administrative Council decided to do so, and then adjourned the meeting. (Havas dispatch of the 13th)</p>

<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin said in a speech at Albert Hall today that when the League of Nations General Assembly meets in the autumn, it must consider whether the League of Nations needs to be changed and how to change it. He hoped that such changes would enable non-member states to join as well. Military sanctions are a necessary part of collective security and are ultimately unavoidable. The work thereafter is to re-examine the entire issue of sanctions and collective security based on past experience. The results that may be obtained in the future will be of great importance to the future situation in Europe. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) After the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting today hotly debated the report submitted by the Italian government to the Slave Commission, it adjourned to June 15, when it will continue to discuss the Italian-Ethiopian case. The result of the debate on the Italian report was to send the document to the members of the Slave Commission with a note stating, "This document was sent by the military authorities who violated the League of Nations Covenant and occupied foreign territory." Some delegations in the League of Nations will leave here tonight. However, British Foreign Minister Eden, after a busy day, still has to fulfill some appointments, so he will stay here until tomorrow before starting his journey. Eden spent the entire morning today meeting with guests, including Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu, Greek representative Politis, League of Nations Commissioner in Danzig Lester, and Danzig Senate President Greiser. (Reuters dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council held a non-public meeting at 5:00 p.m. today and decided to hold an extraordinary meeting on June 16 to discuss the entire Italian-Ethiopian issue and the Locarno case as a whole. During the meeting, British Foreign Minister Eden, as chairman, presented the report drafted by the Advisory Committee on the Issue of Slave Trade and said that the report listed several documents on the slave trade situation in Abyssinia, which were submitted by Italy at a time when Italy was violating the Covenant and engaged in war against Ethiopia. Therefore, the report should be announced, and he requested the Administrative Council to decide. It was decided that the report would still be published, but with a statement that the Administrative Council's view on the Italian-Ethiopian dispute would not be changed by the documents submitted by Italy. The Administrative Council then decided to extend the mission of Lester, the High Commissioner of the League of Nations in the Free City of Danzig, by one year and to convene an international conference with Norwegian Reistad as chairman to discuss an international convention using radio broadcasting as a tool to promote peace. Thereupon, the Administrative Council held an open meeting, passed various reports, and the current session was concluded. (Havas dispatch of the 13th)</p>

<p>(Rome) The Italian people are now demanding that all countries cancel sanctions and recognize the annexation of Ethiopia. Whether Italy will continue to be a member of the League of Nations remains uncertain. It is expected that after the Italian Chamber of Deputies passes the order to annex Ethiopia today, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will make an important statement on this issue. This order, as an urgent plan, will be passed by the Chamber of Deputies in a continuous reading. According to sources from responsible circles, the League of Nations Administrative Council's maintenance of sanctions is forcing Italy to suspend cooperation with the League of Nations. However, various speculations about the departure of the Italian delegation from Geneva are still premature. The semi-official Italian newspaper Il Giornale d'Italia today published an article by Gaeta, stating that the Italian government is now seriously considering the issue of withdrawing from the League of Nations. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Prime Minister Mussolini will announce in the Chamber of Deputies tomorrow whether Italy will remain a member of the League of Nations. Official sources here stated that only he knows Mussolini's plans. Although he is deeply indignant at the League of Nations' decision to maintain sanctions, diplomatic circles doubt whether Italy will withdraw from the League of Nations, but they also acknowledge that the situation is very serious. The editor of Mussolini's mouthpiece, Il Giornale d'Italia, Gaeta, published an article today, saying that Italy is tired of the League of Nations. The Italian people have calmly accepted the League of Nations' unfair judgment on Italy. The departure of the Italian delegation from Geneva can be regarded as the prelude to Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations. Italian Chief Representative Aloisi declined to comment on his departure from Geneva, saying only that he was ordered to return home and knew nothing else. As to whether he would still go to Geneva, Aloisi declined to answer, but another representative said, "I doubt it very much. The situation is indeed very serious." (National Electric dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the withdrawal of the Italian delegation to the League of Nations, semi-official sources recently stated that it is impossible to determine what this move means at this time. Since the League of Nations' views on the Ethiopian issue are still contradictory to Italy's views, Italy has no choice but to suspend cooperation with the League of Nations.

<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin said in the House of Commons yesterday in response to various questions about the Italian-Ethiopian incident that when the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Grandi, delivered the Italian order to declare the annexation of Ethiopia and the appointment of the Italian King with the title of Emperor of Ethiopia to the Foreign Office on Tuesday, the Foreign Office told him that Britain received the document with various reservations and would submit it to Foreign Minister Eden for his consideration and handling after he returned to London from Geneva. The Prime Minister then mentioned the content of the letter from General Badoglio, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, received by the British Embassy and other embassies in Addis Ababa, saying that the British government had instructed the British Minister to Ethiopia, Barton, to make it clear that he recognized General Badoglio as the authority in military occupation of Addis Ababa and that his current dealings with General Badoglio were based on this position. The Prime Minister also answered another question from the opposition party, saying that the British government had repeatedly stated that Britain's policy on the Italian-Ethiopian dispute was based on the collective decisions of the League of Nations. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources, the government will soon send a memorandum to the Italian government regarding the Italian annexation of Ethiopia. When the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Grandi, delivered a copy of the annexation order to the Foreign Office the other day, Sir Oliphant, the legal advisor to the Foreign Office, stated his reservations. The cabinet meeting today has already ratified Oliphant's move. As soon as Foreign Minister Eden returns to the country from Geneva, the Italian Ambassador will be notified that the incoming letter has been read, but the reservation will be raised again, and the memorandum will be submitted in a few days. As far as the general opinions of the Foreign Office on the Italian-Ethiopian issue are concerned, they are now advocating a friendly solution with Italy. These people have said that the door to negotiations between Britain and Italy is not willing to be closed at this time, and everything that can cause a split should be avoided. Political leaders also said that there is now a movement in the country that advocates that the views on the current situation should be closer to reality. This movement will inevitably expand in the coming weeks. As a result, when the League of Nations Administrative Council meets on June 16, Foreign Minister Eden's attitude may be influenced by it.

<h3 id="e11">Austrian Cabinet Reorganized: Chancellor Schuschnigg Becomes Dictator; Vice-Chancellor Starhemberg Loses Power; Italian Influence in Austria also Shaken <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Vienna: The Austrian cabinet has undergone a significant reorganization. Chancellor Dr. Kurt Schuschnigg has assumed control of both the Foreign and Defense Ministries, effectively becoming Austria's sole dictator. The cabinet deliberated for ten hours. According to a semi-official statement released at 0:45 this morning, the cabinet resolved that all critical domestic and foreign political matters should be handled by Dr. Schuschnigg. This move aims to forcefully concentrate all the forces preparing to build Austria and provide political cover to all those in Austria who support national independence. The main lines of Austria's domestic and foreign policies... However... It is said that the most noteworthy aspect of this cabinet reshuffle is the loss of power by Vice-Chancellor Starhemberg. (Reuter, 14th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) The Austrian cabinet was suddenly reorganized, with Chancellor Dr. Kurt Schuschnigg becoming Austria's sole dictator and ousting Interior Guard leader Vice-Chancellor Starhemberg from the government. This is in fact a victory of democracy over fascism. The cabinet deliberated for ten hours, adjourning late last night, before announcing the cabinet reshuffle. According to a semi-official statement, this move stems from policy differences between Schuschnigg and Starhemberg. Schuschnigg's policies are based on democratic principles, which clash with Starhemberg's. Starhemberg also opposed the disarmament of the Interior Guard. Starhemberg initially served as Vice-Chancellor in the Dollfuss cabinet. After Schuschnigg took office as Chancellor, Starhemberg continued in this role, attempting to expand his power in the hope of becoming Austria's dictator, but unexpectedly suffered a defeat. This cabinet reshuffle will significantly diminish the influence of fascism in Austria. (Reuter, 14th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Chancellor Schuschnigg suddenly reorganized the cabinet at 3:30 this morning, removing Vice-Chancellor Prince Starhemberg and Foreign Minister Weidengg from the new cabinet. Furthermore, members will be assigned to preside over the Patriotic Front led by Prince Starhemberg. The new cabinet is the third cabinet led by Schuschnigg. Its members are as follows:</p>
<p>Chancellor and Minister of Defense and Foreign Affairs: Kurt Schuschnigg</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor and Minister of Interior: Baron Fielers (Patriotic Front member concurrently serving as Minister of Interior)</p>
<p>Minister of Justice: Hammerstein (newly appointed)</p>
<p>Minister of Education: Dengtona (reappointed)</p>
<p>Minister of Social Welfare: Breichu (former Minister without Portfolio)</p>
<p>Minister of Finance: Traxlsou (reappointed)</p>
<p>Minister of Commerce: Studqing (reappointed) (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Vice-Chancellor and Interior Guard leader Starhemberg is now replaced by Major Babarenfielers, who concurrently heads the Ministries of Interior and Public Security. As for Starhemberg's position as supreme leader of the "Fatherland Front," it is taken over by Dr. Schuschnigg. The "Fatherland Front" is the national party founded by the late Dr. Dollfuss. (Reuter, 14th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Chancellor Schuschnigg suddenly reorganized the cabinet this morning. Only the position of Minister of Agriculture remains undecided. Recently, former cabinet member Fordmer was appointed to this position, completing the organization of the new cabinet. It does not include any members of the Greater German Party, which is no different from the previous cabinet. Fordmer belongs to the Catholic Social Party. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Responsible sources have recently provided explanations regarding Chancellor Schuschnigg's cabinet reshuffle. It is said that former Vice-Chancellor Prince Starhemberg sent a telegram to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday in the name of "the Austrian people fighting for Fascism," congratulating him on the successful annexation of Abyssinia. The wording strongly favored Fascism and severely criticized democracy, without seeking prior consent from cabinet members, which was deemed inappropriate. Foreign envoys stationed in Austria also expressed their dissatisfaction as a result. Chancellor Schuschnigg then resolutely reorganized the cabinet, ousting Prince Starhemberg from the new cabinet. Furthermore, well-informed sources say that Schuschnigg and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini have a close friendship and are unlikely to have misunderstandings as a result of this. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) Diplomatic circles believe that the main reason for the reorganization of the Austrian cabinet is that Italy, under pressure from sanctions, has had to reduce its subsidies to the Austrian Home Guard (i.e., Austrian Fascists). The enthusiastic telegram sent by Starhemberg to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini on Sunday, congratulating him on the annexation of Abyssinia, was also a factor in promoting the cabinet reshuffle. Italy has always regarded Starhemberg as a pro-Italian leader, and is quite anxious to hear of his downfall, while France is gladly celebrating, believing that Austria's independence can be strengthened by this change. Germany welcomes Starhemberg's departure, but regrets that the Social Democratic Party has gained power in the new Austrian cabinet. (Reuter, 14th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Chancellor Schuschnigg suddenly reorganized the cabinet and removed Vice-Chancellor Prince Starhemberg from the new cabinet. The process is worth noting. Previously, Chancellor Schuschnigg led members of the Free Federation (i.e., Catholic labor groups) in a spring parade last Sunday. Hundreds of Interior Guard members (whose leader was Vice-Chancellor Prince Starhemberg) hurled insults at him. The next day, the Chancellor still urged Prince Starhemberg to rectify discipline in a friendly manner. Until yesterday, although there was talk of reorganizing the cabinet, the Chancellor's intention was only to change a few minor cabinet members and reorganize the Patriotic Front. He still intended to maintain the dual leadership with Prince Starhemberg. Unexpectedly, Prince Starhemberg sent a telegram to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in the name of "the Austrian people fighting for Fascism," congratulating him on the successful annexation of Abyssinia. The wording severely criticized democracy, without seeking prior consent. The Chancellor found Starhemberg's excessive actions unbearable and declared last night that he would concurrently serve as Foreign Minister to eliminate negative impressions abroad and directly lead the Patriotic Front to stabilize domestic public opinion. This is the reason for the sudden reorganization of the cabinet this morning. From now on, Austria's dual leadership has been transformed into a dictatorship. In terms of its political program, all Austrians, regardless of their political views, should unite and work together for Austria's independence. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Dr. Kurt Schuschnigg is only thirty-nine years old. He came to power after the Vienna tragedy in July 1934, when Dr. Dollfuss was murdered. He was awarded several medals for his outstanding military service in the European War. When he was a first lieutenant in the heavy artillery, he was captured by Italian soldiers. Shortly after, the European War ended. Dr. Schuschnigg was released back to Austria in 1919, practiced law, and was elected as a member of parliament in 1927, and then became a member of the Judiciary Committee. During the constitutional reform of 1929, Dr. Schuschnigg's speeches were well-received, and his name became well-known. He served as Minister of Justice in 1932, and concurrently as Minister of Education in 1933. The following year, he succeeded Dollfuss as Chancellor, and became a world figure. (Reuter, 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e12">British Cabinet in a Difficult Position; Part of the Public Attacks Baldwin <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(London) Political figures stated tonight that the difficulties encountered by the cabinet are now extremely serious, but observing the political situation, it is not impossible to find a solution. There are roughly five major difficult issues. First, the Italian-Abyssinian problem requires a glorious solution that does not increase the disputes between Britain and Italy, and also maintains the prestige of the League of Nations. This matter is inherently complex and difficult to handle, but the cabinet should face the difficulties head-on. Former Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of Commons last week, in which he strongly advocated for the abolition of sanctions, but the majority of public opinion still does not agree with this view. At this time, public sentiment is strongly supportive of Abyssinia, while political circles want to ease relations between Britain and Italy. The cabinet's task is to mediate between the two. Second, while the cabinet's task regarding the Italian-Abyssinian problem is extremely important, the actions taken by the German National Socialist Party are sufficient to endanger the status quo in Europe. Weighing the importance, the German problem is naturally a threat at the elbow, while the Italian-Abyssinian problem is relatively minor. As for the British proposals presented, there have been unfavorable reactions from the German side. The German reply is expected to be issued at the end of June. Third, the conflict between Palestinian Arabs and Jews is causing the cabinet to feel uneasy, but the actual situation is not as serious as people say. The cabinet decided on Sunday (the 11th) to send additional troops to be dispatched soon to strengthen the defenses. It is expected that order there will be restored soon. Fourth, the election results of the Egyptian House of Representatives, in which the Nationalist Party won a great victory, is regrettable from the British perspective, but the conclusion of the Anglo-Egyptian agreement should not be affected. Fifth, regarding the leak of the budget bill, if certain cabinet members are indeed guilty as a result of the investigation, then the Baldwin cabinet should resign. However, as of now, the investigation is not focusing on the responsibility of cabinet members, and it is too early to speculate on the outcome of the case. If Baldwin were to retire, then the position of Prime Minister would likely be promoted to the current Finance Minister Chamberlain. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) It is well known that Prime Minister Baldwin is in a difficult position. The Daily Express recently launched an attack on him. Its publisher, Lord Beaverbrook, published a shocking article in the newspaper entitled "Will Baldwin Repent?" It said, "Leading figures are nowhere to be seen. It is futile to seek them in the cabinet, and there is no one in the front rows of the House of Commons. Since MacDonald and Baldwin formed the National Government in 1931, the leader whom the nation looks up to has disappeared like a crane in the sky. What have MacDonald and Baldwin done? Their policies have been negligent, and they have completely disregarded the interests of the empire. In a word, it is failure after failure. After each failure, those responsible still cannot step down to make way for the capable. Will they ever repent?" (Havas, 14th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Socialist leader Blum is expected to succeed Sarraut as Prime Minister at the beginning of next month. Today, he invited the Deputy Mayor of Lille, Salengro, and the Deputy Mayor of La Roche, Lebas, to join his cabinet, one in charge of public works and the other in charge of internal affairs. At the same time, the presidium of the executive committee of the Radical Socialist Party has unanimously accepted the Socialist Party's invitation to cooperate with them in the next government. This resolution is expected to be unanimously approved by the plenary meeting of the executive committee. Blum also invited the General Confederation of Labor, jointly organized by the labor and communist parties, to participate in the new government, but has not yet received a reply. (Reuter, 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The orthodox Socialist Party previously sent letters to the Communist Party, the General Confederation of Trade Unions, and the Radical Socialist Party, inviting them to participate in the People's Front cabinet. The Communist Party and the General Confederation of Trade Unions have both declined, only agreeing to support the future cabinet. Recently, the executive committee of the Radical Socialist Party held a meeting to discuss this matter, and as a result, it was resolved to accept the Socialist Party's invitation to participate in the cabinet.

<p>(Tokyo) The plenary session of the House of Peers opened at 10:20 AM. Dozens of young ladies from a finishing school in the audience added a unique luster. The agenda began with speeches questioning the Ministers of State. Dr. Tanaka Date Ai (independent) took the podium and said that in view of the frequent occurrence of various incidents recently, he deeply felt the great influence of Chinese characters. Although the Minister of Education advocated kana characters, are there no characters other than kana characters? He heard that His Majesty is also very concerned about the Chinese character problem. He then strongly advocated his Roman alphabet theory. Minister of Education Hiraizumi took the podium to respond, saying that there are indeed points in the ideology of Chinese characters that are inconsistent with the national foundation of Japan, but to this day, scholars have fully overcome them. The issue of Roman alphabet and kana characters is very important and will be carefully studied.</p>
<p>Next, Tsunemitsu Shigesato (Research Society) took the podium and said that Prime Minister Hirota, after forming the cabinet, strongly advocated loyalty to the Imperial Family, which deeply pleased him. However, the current cabinet has actually appointed people who lost their seats as a result of the general election, which is a contempt for public opinion. Disrespect for public opinion will bring disaster. He openly attacked the appointment of Suzuki Masatsugu as President of the Seiyukai. He then mentioned the Aizawa Incident, and finally said that the cultivation of the Japanese spirit requires a principled leadership and a political background. Instead of imitating the failed Western politics, it is better to teach the West the Japanese politics based on the Imperial Family and the family system. Prime Minister Hirota replied that he has fully stated the government's position on the issue of the national polity, and he believes the people will understand. The appointment of Suzuki Kisaburo was requested because his experience and character are impeccable. The session adjourned at noon. (Dentsu, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) During Tsunemitsu Shigesato's questioning at today's plenary session of the House of Peers, he said, "Japanese naval officers receive salaries, so they are professional soldiers, while soldiers are obligated to serve, so the sense of loyalty is stronger among soldiers and weaker among officers. The salaries of officers should be abolished and replaced with mandatory service. The loyalty of soldiers is superior to that of officers, as exemplified by the Three Brave Bombers." At this, the mild-mannered Naval Minister Nagano became angrily, took the podium and refuted, saying that Tsunemitsu's outrageous remarks were unbearable to hear. There is no difference in the sense of loyalty between officers and soldiers. Officers and soldiers are united and serve with utmost sincerity. He demanded that Tsunemitsu retract his previous remarks. Tsunemitsu, who took the podium again to question, only questioned Prime Minister Hirota again and did not retract. Naval Minister Nagano became increasingly stern and said, "Why does Tsunemitsu not say a word?" He still demanded a retraction. Tsunemitsu took the podium to explain, saying that he had no time to do so because the chairman had paid attention. However, the atmosphere in the House has become tense because of this, and it will become an issue in the future. (Dentsu, 14th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita answered questions regarding the South Seas Mandate and other issues at the first budget subcommittee meeting on the afternoon of the 14th, as follows: The Japanese government has already resolved to urge the Consul General in Manila to instruct the Davao Consul to negotiate on the issue of land owned by Japanese residents in the Philippines, so as to achieve a resolution as soon as possible. He felt that American officials would not secretly instigate it. As for Japan's rights and interests in the South Seas Mandate, they are very clear. Japan has already decided not to return them, so it cannot be moved by any statements from others. (Domei, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At this morning's fourth budget subcommittee meeting, Hanawa Norikazu of the Minseito Party raised a question regarding Pacific defenses, which was answered by the Army Minister. The gist of their exchange is recorded below:</p>
<p>Hanawa asked: The limitations on Pacific defenses will soon be lifted. From now on, we should have adequate defenses for the national defense line from the Southwest Islands to Taiwan. The Army Minister replied: After the Washington Treaty is abolished, the limitations on Pacific defenses will also be lifted. Therefore, before a new treaty to replace the said treaty is concluded, it is naturally necessary not only to restore the defense facilities that were interrupted according to the provisions of the treaty at the time, but also to create defense facilities to cope with the new situation in the Pacific. The military believes that this situation should be handled without any regrets. (Domei News Agency, 14th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Mikami Sanji, an independent member of the Japanese Upper House, gave a speech at the plenary session of the House of Peers on the 7th of this month, stating, "The dignity of the Imperial Family must be absolutely maintained not only domestically, but also abroad." He then said, "China is presumptuous and calls itself the Republic of China." However, we refer to it as "Zhonghua," which is extremely disrespectful to the dignity of our national polity.

<p>(London) During today's meeting of the House of Commons, Conservative MP Moore asked the government about recent reports of Chinese people employed by British merchants in "Manchukuo" being arrested by "Manchukuo" police and Japanese military police. He asked if this was true and requested Prime Minister Baldwin to explain the matter. Baldwin stated briefly, "Between October and November last year, many Chinese people employed by British merchants in southern Manchuria were arrested by local officials on suspicion of being communists. Although no British nationals were arrested, the extraterritorial rights enjoyed by British people were violated during the arrests, and charitable and commercial institutions in southern Manchuria were also harassed. Subsequently, the British government lodged protests with the Japanese government and local authorities. As a result, all but five of those arrested were released. On April 14th and 17th of this year, two similar cases occurred with the same reasons for arrest, including six British merchant employees. The government has instructed Clive, the ambassador to Japan, to lodge another protest with the Japanese government." Conservative MP Lennox then asked, "Would it be more convenient for the British ambassador to negotiate with the Japanese government if Britain recognized 'Manchukuo'?" Baldwin did not answer.

<p>(Washington) Moser, Director of the Far East Division of the Department of Commerce, today released an annual review of economic conditions, stating that the business recovery in Far Eastern countries last year will continue this year. In China, the large-scale exports stimulated after the currency system reform in mid-November last year could not be maintained this spring. It is said that financial tycoons in Shanghai generally believe that if the import surplus situation remains severe, the Chinese government may lower the exchange rate of the legal tender again. However, the general situation in China at present seems to be much better than in previous years. After the establishment of the Philippine Autonomous Government, people in the Philippines expect this year to be prosperous, and cash exports will exceed any year since 1930. The government's tax revenue has reached a new record, and national credit is also very strong. The economic and financial situation in Japan also continues to be stable. Although the Bank of Japan experienced the February 26th Incident, it was able to cope with it easily without any panic. Although industrial production has decreased slightly, it is still quite abundant. Some observers believe that Japan's cotton textile industry has reached a "plateau" level and is unlikely to have any sudden development without special needs. (Thirteenth National Electric)</p>

<p>(London) Regarding the leakage of budget information, Colonial Secretary Thomas and his sons have been implicated. The government organized a special court yesterday to handle the matter. Thomas appeared in court this morning and testified for forty-five minutes. It is said that "Since I entered politics, I have participated in the preparation of the budget more than nine times, which can almost break the general record. I have never heard of any leakage of information." It is regrettable that the outside world knew about the tax increase case in advance, but it is not true that this is related to my wife buying a house. Then, in response to the court's questions, he recounted his political experience and said that after the case occurred, a friend informed him that his son was also involved. He immediately summoned his son and questioned him strictly. His son said he knew nothing. He also said that when the budget information was leaked, it was during the Easter holiday. At that time, he was taking his family to the beach in Ferring for vacation and then went to Brighton. He never disclosed the budget information to anyone. After his son was implicated, he immediately asked Prime Minister Baldwin to investigate his son's business situation. As far as he knows, Sir Bowater, a member of Parliament, is one of his son's customers. The former had expressed to his son his deep concern about the impending increase in income tax rates. His son then told him that he had dealings with Lloyd's Insurance Company and would ask the company on his behalf if there was any way to deal with it. External rumors probably arose from this. After Thomas finished his statement, he agreed to submit his bank passbook and investment list for review at the request of the magistrate. (Fourteenth Havas Electric)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Song Zheyuan decided to return to Peiping on the fifteenth, with Zhang Zizhong accompanying him. Diplomatic matters are still being handled by Xiao Zhenying in Tianjin to negotiate with Nagami on the Hebei-East issue. The results of Yin Rugeng's activities in the Kwantung Army Headquarters have led to the discovery of snags in the future of the negotiations. Ueda's communication to cancel the Hebei-East organization indicated a postponement. Tada, due to his impending return to his country, claimed that this was the responsibility of the successor. Lieutenant Colonel Hayashi, a staff officer of the Tianjin Garrison Department, visited Xiao twice on the thirteenth and fourteenth, conveying his opinions, saying that the cancellation of the puppet organization was not a problem, but that it would have to wait until Tashiro took office before continuing the discussion. As of the fourteenth, diplomatic negotiations had stalled. (Fourteenth Special Electric)</p>

Currently, diplomatic affairs are still the responsibility of Matsumuro Nagami. After Song returns to Peiping, he will not hold diplomatic talks for the time being, waiting for the situation to develop before seeking a way forward. (Fourteenth Special Electric)</p>

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After returning from Europe, Mr. Hu Hanmin immediately returned to Guangzhou and resided in Yan Garden in Dongshan. He repeatedly discussed national policies with the southwest party and government authorities to cope with foreign affairs and the current critical situation. However, after Mr. Hu contracted an illness in Hong Kong, although he went abroad for half a year of recuperation, the disease was not eradicated. After returning to Guangdong, the old illness recurred from time to time. In the past week, the weather here has changed, and the temperature has been inconsistent. Mr. Hu's sick body was again affected by the adverse weather, and the old illness suddenly broke out. Chinese and Western doctors were helpless, and he died at 7:40 p.m. on the 12th of this month. It is truly regrettable. Previously, Mr. Hu suffered from high blood pressure on the 9th of the month, but he was still able to go to his brother-in-law Chen Rong's home, Yong Garden, to chat and play chess when he was in the mood. However, due to excessive use of his brain, he fainted once at Chen's house that night. His family immediately summoned doctors Yang Zixiang and Chen Yiping for diagnosis and treatment. At that time, the examination showed a systolic blood pressure of 210 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure of 135 mmHg, with left-sided hemiplegia. He was diagnosed with right-sided cerebral hemorrhage. Artificial ice was immediately applied to his head. At about 10 p.m., he regained consciousness. Mr. Hu seemed to know that he would not recover, so he immediately summoned party, government, and military leaders such as Xiao Focheng, Zou Lu, Chen Jitang, Lin Yunhai, Yang Xiji, Chen Yaoyuan, Chen Jiayou, Liu Jiwen, Huang Jilu, Zhang Renmin, Lin Yizhong, Chen Rong, Wang Jiwen, Hu Yisheng, and Mrs. Hu, Chen Shuzi, and his daughter, Hu Mulan, to his bedside. He dictated his will, which was recorded by Xiao Focheng. After dictating his will, Hu appeared very anxious, scratching his head frequently, and making gestures as if he wanted to get up. He also called his family to help him return home. The doctor used injections to treat him and help him sleep. On the morning of the 10th, his condition worsened, and he became unconscious. His family again invited doctors Bairnuohe and Huang Xizhang for diagnosis and treatment. They all agreed that his heart was weak and injected cardiac stimulants. In the afternoon, Deng Zhende, director of the Guangzhou Municipal Health Bureau, and Chinese medicine doctor Huang Shengshan arrived for diagnosis. All the doctors' judgments were the same. On the 10th, Hu's condition still did not improve. By the afternoon of the 11th, it became critical. His pulse was intermittent, his systolic blood pressure increased to 230 mmHg, his diastolic blood pressure was 150 mmHg, his temperature increased to 40.02 degrees Celsius, and his pulse increased to 135 beats per minute. His respiration was 42 breaths per minute. On that day, doctors Chuan Lin and Chi Zheng were invited to diagnose him again, and they all focused on strengthening his heart and preventing pulmonary congestion and other complications. By the 12th, pulmonary congestion symptoms did indeed appear, his body temperature increased to 40.7 degrees Celsius, his pulse reached 140 beats per minute, and his respiration reached 46 breaths per minute. In the afternoon, his breathing became more rapid, reaching 56 breaths per minute, his pulse reached 160 beats, and his systolic blood pressure suddenly dropped to 140 mmHg, while his diastolic blood pressure was 90 mmHg. Although injections were frequently administered, his heart gradually failed, and he died in Yong Garden (Chen Rong's residence) at 7:40 p.m. on the 12th. Mrs. Hu, Chen Shuzi, and her daughter, Mulan, cried in grief. Party, government, and military officials all went to Yong Garden to offer condolences. They then decided to send Mr. Hu's body to the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall for the coffin to be sealed. The body was transported by ambulance from the Municipal Hospital. Party and government officials Zou Lu, Chen Jitang, and Lin Yunhai all walked alongside to escort it. After entering the memorial hall, the body was placed in the main hall. Mr. Hu's body was dressed in a blue padded long robe and a black padded satin mandarin jacket. At about 9 p.m. that night, party, government, and military officials Zou Lu, Lin Yunhai, Chen Jiayou, Yang Xiji, Qu Fangpu, Lin Yizhong, Hu Yisheng, Zhang Renmin, Chen Yaoyuan, Huang Jilu, Yu Hanmou, Miao Peinan, Huang Linshu, Gan Jiehou, Liu Jiwen, Chen Rong, Li Xiangen, Cui Guangxiu, and others held a meeting in the east building of the memorial hall and organized the Hu Chairman Funeral Committee. The committee was divided into three sections: general affairs, finance, and secretarial, to handle the funeral affairs. It was also decided that Mr. Hu's body would be covered on the left and right with the party and national flags, and the coffin would be sealed at 4 p.m. on the 13th. All agencies inside and outside the province will cease all entertainment for one day from the 13th and fly flags at half-mast for three days to express mourning. (May 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">Japan's New Southern Policy of Southern Advancement: Establishment of Two Colonial Companies in Taiwan and Nanyang; Purpose of the Movement to Teach Chinese in Taiwan <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The Japanese naval authorities advocate defending the north and advancing to the south. Therefore, the Japanese cabinet discussed and agreed with the army and navy to place the focus of the southern advancement policy on Taiwan. This can be realized immediately after the special parliament currently in session passes it. The initial point of contention was whether to merge the Nanyang mandated territories under the jurisdiction of the Taiwan Governor-General and abolish the Nanyang Agency, or for the Nanyang Agency to remain independent while Taiwan would be responsible for the development of "Nanhua" and the "Outer Nanyang" north of the equator, and the Nanyang Agency would be responsible for the development of the "Inner Nanyang" south of the equator. The Japanese cabinet and the army strongly advocated unifying the southern advancement policy, so they advocated placing the entire Nanyang Agency under the control of the Taiwan Governor-General. The Ministry of Colonial Affairs and the Ministry of the Navy opposed this. The Ministry of Colonial Affairs believed that the mandated territories were not territory and that merging them would turn them into territory, which would violate the constitution. The Navy believed that the most important military and economic areas for southern advancement, Borneo, New Guinea, and the Dutch East Indies, were all in the "Inner Nanyang" south of the equator, and the Nanyang Agency was close to them, making it most suitable for overseeing their development. Taiwan was too far away, and it would be difficult to remotely manage them effectively. Recently, after several compromises by the cabinet, a new plan called the "New Southern Policy" was established. Its main points are: To change the traditional Taiwan governance policy, which places the political center in Taipei and the economic center in Keelung, and place the economic center in Kaohsiung instead (note that Keelung is in the northernmost part of the island of Taiwan, and Kaohsiung is in the southernmost part), making it the economic headquarters for the South Pacific. To make Kaohsiung the center of communication between the Nanyang mandated territories and Taiwan, establish a new regular shipping route between the two to ensure close contact. To this end, a "Taiwan Colonial Company," which will be the central guiding organization for this economic development policy, is submitting a bill to the current parliament for immediate realization. To establish a "Nanyang Colonial Company" (which can be regarded as a sister company to the Taiwan Colonial Company), submit a survey fee to the current parliament as a supplementary budget, and immediately establish it by order of the Nanyang Agency, with its headquarters in Palau (the capital of the mandated territory). At the same time, regarding the expansion of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office, it is planned to raise the Governor-General's status to the same as that of the Korean Governor-General. Although this new plan does not abolish the Nanyang Agency, the political and economic center is clearly still placed in Taiwan.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Colonial Company's organization will have a total capital of 30 million yuan, with the government contributing half, 15 million yuan. It is planned to allocate land and uncultivated wilderness and mountain forests of Taiwan official lease with a value of 15 million yuan to fill it. Hiratsuka, the chief of general affairs of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office, is currently in Tokyo attending the parliament and compromising with the cabinet regarding this case. The Taiwan Governor-General's Office held a meeting of the heads of the departments on May 3 and decided to organize a "Committee for the Evaluation of Government-Owned Property" to evaluate about 40,000 acres of government-leased land and uncultivated wilderness and mountain forests on the island of Taiwan. The company's business is defined as agriculture, forestry, immigration, and other businesses necessary for development. Coinciding with this is the movement to teach Chinese in Taiwan, which plans to abolish the English curriculum in schools and replace it with Chinese. The reason is that the targets of the southern advancement are Nanhua and Nanyang. Those who control the economic power in these two areas are mostly Fujianese and Cantonese people, and overseas Chinese from these two provinces. The Taiwanese are of the same ethnicity and culture as them and will inevitably stand in the forefront of southern development. Therefore, Chinese is necessary. The regular air route between Taipei and Bangkok, Thailand, was implemented this year. From this year (Showa 11) onwards, a subsidy of 144,400 yuan will be provided until the 20th year of Showa, for a total subsidy of 4,488,800 yuan over ten years. In short, Japan's aggressive southern advancement policy is not limited to Nanhua but covers the entire Nanyang, both north and south of the equator, and encompasses everything up to Singapore. This is evident in its strengthening of Taiwan and its mandated territories in the Caroline Islands, as well as its close ties with Thailand. (May 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Recent Situation of Road Construction and Water Management in Fujian Province; Striving to Develop Important Highways; Water Conservancy Agencies Measuring Water Levels <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Previously, the highway construction in this province was suspended from the second half of the 24th year (that is, from January of this year) due to financial difficulties. Recently, due to orders from the central government, highways are important and should still be constructed in sections to facilitate transportation. Therefore, the authorities in this province are resuming the gradual development of highways. The work plan is to first construct the main lines and then to repair and complete the original lines. According to news from the Provincial Highway Engineering Office, there are three main highways in this province: the Fuzhou-Quanzhou-Xiamen line, the Pucheng-Jian'ou-Yanping line, and the Fuzhou-Gutian-Jian'ou line. The Fuzhou-Quanzhou-Xiamen Road has been divided into the Fuzhou-Quanzhou and Quanzhou-Xiamen sections since it was taken back by the Construction Department for official management. Currently, the bridges and road surfaces of the entire line need to be actively repaired. The total cost is estimated to be more than 300,000 yuan, and a portion of the work has already started. The original allocated road maintenance fee for the Pucheng-Jian'ou-Yanping Road was 5,000 yuan per month, but this included the Chong'an-Jianning, Yanping-Jianning, and Shao'an-Jianning roads, which was a drop in the bucket. However, in order to facilitate traffic between Fujian and Zhejiang, the road surface and bridges of this line urgently need to be repaired. The estimated cost is more than 600,000 yuan, and the work has already begun gradually and should be completed separately in the autumn. As for the Fuzhou-Gutian-Jian'ou line, the total length is 234 kilometers, and the estimated construction cost is 850,000 yuan. It is currently being actively planned and is scheduled to start construction on July 1 and will take eight months to complete. After this line is completed, it will be extremely convenient for traffic between Fujian and Zhejiang. In addition, for other important highways, such as the highway from Liancheng to Jianning and other counties, the Construction Department has dispatched a surveying team to complete the surveying. The highway from Yong'an to Datian and other counties has already begun surveying. The office is currently planning the charts and plans. Once these several lines are completed, the provincial highway network will reach a considerable level of completeness.</p>
<p>In terms of water management, the upper reaches of the Minjiang River often experience seasonal rains in early summer, causing the river to swell and rush down, flooding the plains of Fuzhou, causing significant losses as fields and houses are submerged. During the flood season last year, the General Water Conservancy Engineering Office dispatched a flow measurement team to measure the flood flow and sediment content of the Minjiang River at Zhuqi and Guanyinting along the Minjiang River, in order to study the amount of water coming from the upper reaches as preliminary design data for guiding and managing the Minjiang River. The flood season has arrived again this year, and the measurement of flow and water level ranges of various streams has been further expanded. In addition to still setting up flow measurement stations in Zhuqi and Guanyinting, a flow measurement station has also been added to the Yongfu River. Water gauges have been installed along the river in Shuiji, Fengle, Jianyang, Nanping, Shaxiankou, Shaxian, Shunchang, Youxikou, Shuikou, Minqingkou, and other places to measure the rise and fall of floods. Daily and nightly records will be kept at Nanping, Shuikou, Zhuqi, Guanyinting, Wanbianjiao, Xiadou, Mawei, Nantai, and Hongshanqiao without interruption. In addition, an engineer will be stationed in Yanping to inspect the water level records in various places, investigate the drought and flood conditions in various counties, and the water conservancy projects that should be carried out, as well as the navigation issues of various streams. The surveying team departed for various places on the 12th of this month to begin work. The office has also formulated temporary regulations for flow measurement and ordered the team to comply with them. (May 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Regulations for Flood Prevention along the Ejiang River: County Magistrates to Serve as Flood Prevention Commissioners, Establishment of Flood Control Sections and Allocation of Strong Laborers <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Regarding flood prevention measures for the main embankments of the Yangtze and Xiang Rivers in Hubei Province, Qin Fen, Secretary-General of the National Economic Council, previously visited and agreed with the Provincial Government on six principles. The Provincial Government separately ordered their implementation. Currently, the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, recognizing the imminent arrival of the high-water season and the urgent need for flood prevention planning, has drafted "Flood Prevention Regulations for the Main Embankments of the Jianghan River" based on the aforementioned principles. These regulations have been submitted to the Provincial Government for approval at a meeting and will be promulgated to all counties with embankments for compliance. The content of the flood prevention regulations specifies that the flood prevention period will be from June 1st to the end of August as a standard, but may be adjusted according to the rise and fall of the water level. All flood prevention matters for the main embankments of the Jianghan River will be overseen by the county magistrates of the respective counties with embankments, serving concurrently as flood prevention commissioners. Furthermore, the district heads of each district with embankments will be appointed as flood prevention committee members, supervising the embankment repair and defense offices in their duties. As for flood prevention matters in cities and towns related to the main embankments of the Jianghan River, except for Wuhan City, which will be handled separately, the remaining cities and towns will be managed by their respective Chambers of Commerce or public works agencies, under the direction of the local government and the Jianghan Engineering Bureau's engineering offices. County magistrates serving concurrently as flood prevention commissioners should, before May 15th, jointly with the director of the relevant engineering office or their representative, re-examine and supplement the organization of the embankment repair and defense offices within their jurisdiction, as well as the selection of their directors and embankment watchmen. District heads and flood prevention committee members will be responsible for supervising and ordering responsible personnel to defend against floods, and will order the Baojia heads near the embankment line to assist in all matters. When special dangers occur in important embankment sections, the county magistrate and district head should personally go to the embankment section and jointly monitor the defense with the engineering office. Before the end of May, each embankment repair and defense office, acting under the instructions of the relevant district head or in consultation with the joint Bao chiefs, should allocate a certain number of fixed laborers per embankment protection unit, according to the dangerous embankment sections, from the strong laborers within the protection area. A register should be created and kept on file, and each laborer should be notified to equip themselves with items such as rain hats, raincoats, hoes, baskets, and shoulder poles. In case of minor dangers, groups will be called to the embankment for defense in shifts. In case of major dangers, all groups will go to the embankment simultaneously. In case of special dangers, each protection unit and group will assist each other in defense. Before the end of May, each embankment repair and defense office, acting under the instructions of the relevant district head or in consultation with the joint Bao chiefs, should investigate and register the names, items, quantities, prices, storage locations, and willingness to donate or sell items stored by residents within the protection area that can be used for flood prevention, such as lanterns, reed stalks, bamboo poles, rice straw, yellow beans, soybeans, ropes, hammers, wooden tampers, stone rollers, iron pots, and torn cotton, so that they can be requisitioned at any time after the flood prevention materials are exhausted. Each embankment repair and defense office should assign laborers to each embankment protection unit to patrol in shifts day and night. If a new danger is discovered, a warning is received, or instructions for emergency rescue are given, the unit responsible for defending the embankment should immediately sound the alarm, summon the laborers, supervise the work, and, if necessary, request the assistance of the Baojia head or the military police security team. The engineering offices of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau should, according to the dangerous and safe conditions of each embankment, establish a flood prevention section every 40 kilometers on average within the original sections. In addition to one section being concurrently managed by the original resident embankment section engineering personnel, each remaining flood prevention section will be headed by one temporary engineer, and two supervisors, and several embankment guards. They will handle inspection, verification, guidance, protection, rescue, and reporting of local and upstream water level changes. At the beginning of flood prevention, each section engineer should, under the guidance of the director of the respective engineering office, jointly with the director of each embankment repair and defense office, lead the embankment directors and embankment guards to conduct an inspection, and report to the Jianghan Bureau and the Provincial Government for record-keeping, mapping the width of the embankment, the quality of the soil, the distance from the river, the presence of old leaks or new seepage, rat holes and ant nests, and previous breaches, distinguishing between special danger and secondary danger. Each section engineer should survey and estimate the earthwork for fortifying dangerous sections, including immersion platforms, cutting embankment tops, and planting grass on inner slopes, preparing the work. While reporting for verification, a date should be specified for the embankment repair and defense offices to requisition laborers to handle. Each engineering office or section should, during peacetime and at the time of danger, gather the directors and embankment guards of each embankment repair and defense office to explain the flood prevention guidelines, or convene public lectures for the public. Each engineering office and section should, according to the situation, prepare and purchase important materials for emergency rescue for necessary times. No wages or food expenses will be given for requisitioning civilian labor during the flood prevention period. Compensation may not be given for requisitioning civilian goods during an emergency.

<h3 id="e69">Zhejiang Province Planning to Alleviate the Coal Shortage: Expanding Coal Mines Insufficient to Supply Consumption; Coal Deposits Upstream of the Qiantang River are Being Planned for Exploitation <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: The consumption of coal in the Hangzhou urban area has reached 300 tons per day and approximately 9,000 tons per month due to the recent surge in factories, shops, and residential users. White coal accounts for 60% of this, and bituminous coal accounts for 40%. Demand is even greater in winter due to its wider range of uses. Since the September 18th Incident, all 50+ coal merchants in the city have unanimously switched to using domestic coal. The source of white coal relies solely on transportation from Shanxi and Henan provinces to Zhejiang, while bituminous coal is supplied by coal mines in Shandong, Tianjin, and Anhui provinces. Sales have increased even more than before because a portion of the counties in the interior have gradually learned to use coal. In November of last year, shipments of Shanxi coal suddenly stopped. Recently, the supply from coal-producing areas has been limited, and market prices have skyrocketed. Hangzhou has experienced a coal shortage due to the lack of supplies. As a result, coal merchants jointly requested relief from the municipal government and the Department of Construction, and requested the government to order the Changxing Coal Mine to supply 20 tons of coal to each coal merchant per month as an aid. The Department of Construction dispatched mining expert Zhang Jianyu to the Changxing Coal Mine to investigate the detailed situation of coal production, and he has already returned to the province to report.</p>
<p>Changxing Coal Mine</p>
<p>The Changxing Coal Mine is the only coal-producing area in Zhejiang, located approximately 50 li from the county seat. There is a light railway from the mining area to Wulibao, to facilitate transportation. From Wulibao, it is transported to other ports via waterways. The mine was opened in 1915 with an initial capital of only 40,000 yuan. In 1919, the capital was increased to expand the scope, bringing the total capital to 2 million yuan. Operations were suspended for four years due to the war in 1923. In 1927, the Central Construction Commission took over the mine and operated it under government management, making significant improvements and gradually increasing production. However, the expenses were too high, making it difficult to maintain. In 1932, it was returned to private management. The 5 million yuan in assets paid by the government during the government operation were repaid by the Mining Production Office at 20,000 yuan per month, to be paid off in 48 months. The current total value of the mine's assets has reached 5 million yuan. Financially, it is maintained by the Qinyi Syndicate, formed by the Shanghai Siming Bank. The Construction Committee has also sent personnel to supervise. The monthly income can have a surplus of 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Three Coal Pits</p>
<p>The mine currently has three coal pits that are being actively mined: Simaodun, Dameishan, and Guangxing. Each can produce 500 tons of coal per day, with the highest monthly output being 16,000 tons and the lowest being 13,000 tons. If special processing is required, an additional 100 tons can be produced per day. The current inventory at Wulibao is 3,000 tons. Due to debt relationships, the mine has contracts with factories in Wuxi, Jiaxing, Suzhou, etc., and coal production must be supplied to these factories. It is estimated that the three mines already exploited contain approximately 400,000 tons of coal, which can be used for two years. Currently, the mining area office is actively preparing to open new coal pits. However, shifting the supply to meet the needs of the initial market is likely not feasible in reality.</p>
<p>Miners' Lives</p>
<p>Miners can be divided into two main categories: inland workers, who are electrical and mechanical workers and receive better treatment, and laborers, who are on a contract system, divided into surface workers and underground workers. Wages range from 6 jiao, 8 jiao, to 1 yuan, and are arbitrarily distributed by foremen. Laborers are exploited and dare not resist. Underground work is the hardest, with working hours reaching tens of hours per day. If accidents such as gas explosions occur, lives are at risk of destruction at any time. In case of death, the office provides a burial fee of 30 yuan per person. Currently, the total number of miners is approximately 300,000.</p>
<p>Alleviating the Coal Shortage</p>
<p>In order to fundamentally solve the coal shortage problem in Zhejiang Province, and since Changxing coal cannot increase production to supply consumption in the province, it is essential to find alternative coal sources. It is reported that the authorities have already surveyed a coal deposit site upstream of the Qiantang River in eastern Zhejiang, not far from Hangzhou, and plan to exploit it. The area can also utilize waterway transportation, making transportation costs economical. The Coal Industry Association has also been ordered to investigate and report the exact amount of consumption in detail for overall planning and relief efforts. (May 14th)</p>

<p>Wu Guangtian, the son of Wu Qianmei, the former magistrate of Jiading County, was just over twenty years old. In 1927, while studying at Southeast University in Nanjing, when the Northern Expeditionary Army was settling Shanghai and preparing to attack Nanjing, Wu secretly agreed with comrades to plan an internal response. He was heard by spies, arrested, and killed by Chu Yupu of the Feng Army. After the National Revolutionary Army captured Nanjing, the National Government specially approved the construction of a monument for Wu in Zhongshan Park in the capital, providing annual compensation and allocating funds for funeral expenses. He was given a public burial in his hometown. On the 14th, Wu was publicly buried in the Caihua Jing Cemetery in this city. Nearly five to six hundred people from the party, military, government, business, and academic communities attended the funeral.</p>

<p>The Tailong Flour Company in Putihama, Nancangmen, outside the East Gate of this city, suddenly caught fire due to an electrical fault the day before yesterday. All machinery and factory buildings were burned, with total losses exceeding 400,000 yuan. It is understood that the company had cargo fire insurance worth 150,000 yuan with the British-owned Taiping Insurance Company in Shanghai. The insurance company sent Chang to Wuxi yesterday (14th) morning to investigate, estimating losses of more than 20,000 yuan. The fire insurance for the industrial side was jointly insured by Shanghai insurance professionals, including companies such as Lu Yishi Mo, Empress, Lianna, Siming, and Yizhong, totaling more than 300,000 yuan. Yesterday, Lu Yishi Mo and other foreign firms sent Chinese representative Yao Xiongguan and foreigners to Wuxi to investigate the truth and photograph each department for record-keeping. They returned to Shanghai that day.</p>

Chairman Qian Sunqing presided over the meeting. After discussion, it was decided that the money shops association should comply with the order to resume business on the 15th of this month and disclose the market list. As agreed upon by the county government last year, the exchange rate per legal tender coin should not exceed 300 copper coins or be lower than 290 copper coins. The Chamber of Commerce will send a letter to the county government to report to the province for record-keeping, and will also send letters to the banking and money industries for compliance.</p>

<p>Due to organizing a labor union, workers from 17 foundry factories, including Xicheng, Huasheng, and Longchang in this city, were laid off by the factory owners, leading to a strike. Factory representatives Chen Zikuan, Zhu Zhongnan, Wu Peilin, Xie Zhongzhang, Zhou Zisheng, etc., feared that the foundry workers would not return to work, causing unexpected incidents and greatly affecting the machinery industry. Therefore, they jointly went to the County Chamber of Commerce to request mediation and to the County Government to petition. The Secretary received them and promised to convey the issues raised to County Magistrate Long for review. However, this case requires the joint convening of a meeting between labor and management by the Party Department before mediation can be conducted. The representatives were satisfied and left. The Foundry Workers' Union also sent a letter to the Shanghai Foundry Industry Union requesting assistance. Upon receiving the letter, the Shanghai Union sent a representative to Wuxi to discuss mediation methods with factory representatives Chen Zikuan, etc., and to demand three points on behalf of the labor side: 1. All 22 workers who have been laid off by the factories should return to their original jobs; 2. If workers have no work to do, they should alternate days with those who are working, and the factory should provide meals for the laid-off workers; 3. Working hours should be from 7:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 5:30 PM. However, the management did not accept these conditions, so after a long discussion, they adjourned without result. At the same time, Fang Yuan of the County Chamber of Commerce, considering that it is an extraordinary period and the countryside is in need of machinery for irrigation, and that the foundry workers have suddenly gone on strike, which will inevitably reduce the country's production capacity, also sent a letter to the County Government requesting prompt dispatch of force to stop the strike and order an immediate resumption of work to eliminate potential risks. In order to mediate, the County Party Department convened representatives from labor and management at 10:00 AM yesterday (14th) for a discussion meeting. More than 10 representatives from the management side, including Zhu Zhongnan and Wu Peilin, attended, but no representatives from the labor side were present. Members Xu Chizi and Xiao Ruoqian persuaded them to resume work today (15th) first. All principles proposed by both parties will be discussed again at a meeting between labor and management on the 21st of this month. Currently, the management representatives have agreed to resume operations, but whether the labor side will agree to resume work is still a question.</p>

<p>Qian Gui, a farmer from Zhaozhuangjiao, Wanxiang Village, Eighth District of this county, and his wife, Wu, suddenly had an argument on the night of the second day of this month, which escalated into a physical fight. When the mother saw the situation was bad, she rushed outside to call for help. By the time neighbors heard the commotion and went to mediate, Qian Gui's wife had already fallen in a pool of blood. A sickle was left on the ground, presumably used by her husband to kill her. Qian Gui, realizing that he had caused a disaster, drowned himself in the river out of fear of punishment. The neighbors were shocked and, considering the matter involved human lives, immediately reported it to the local patrol station the next day, which in turn reported it to the county government, who sent personnel to investigate.</p>

<p>The soy sauce industry here has traditionally specialized in making soy sauce, wine, and lees, with thriving business each year. Unexpectedly, a type of chemical soy sauce has recently flooded the market. In Changshu alone, monthly sales reach over 30,000 jin, taking away 30% of the market share of traditional soy sauce. Subsequently, the soy sauce industry requested that the chemical soy sauce be sent to the Zhenru Forensic Medicine Institute for testing. It was determined that it contained large amounts of toxins and was unsuitable for flavoring. Based on this, the soy sauce industry is now making a large-scale petition, urging the government to ban its sale to benefit the industry.</p>

<p>The residents of Shazhou City caused a major dispute by obstructing river works. Subsequently, the county government arrested 12 accomplices and sent them to the Wuxi Security Command for strict military trial. However, the leaders of the case, Tan Jiujin and Ding Shishu, are still at large. Among those arrested, there were some who blindly followed. Therefore, the day before yesterday, more than 60 residents of Shazhou, including old men, women, and children (including three with white hair), carrying flags, went to the Commissioner's Office in Wuxi to petition, demanding the release of the innocent. As the Commissioner was in Beijing on official business, Section Chief Sheng received them. The residents immediately knelt down and begged, and were promised that the case would be handled impartially and that those who were innocent would be released after interrogation. The crowd then regrouped and returned to Changshu.</p>

<p>Jiangdu County Magistrate Ma Zhenbang, considering that the riverbank stretches for dozens of miles and has been repeatedly repaired due to years of erosion by the river tide, gradually shrinking and damaging farmland, and that the boundary dispute caused by building the embankment is nothing but competition for interests, and that the Jiangnan Water Conservancy Bureau has included Guadong in the flood control area during the flood season, proves that the relationship is special and cannot be handled by the local people alone. In addition, the county's financial resources cannot provide assistance. It is imperative to ask the province to do its best to help. In addition to personally going to the province to meet with Shen Baixian, Director of the Department of Construction, to explain everything, he has also prepared a detailed document outlining the reasons and handed it to Shu Guohua, Director of the Construction Bureau, to bring to the Department, requesting prompt approval to forward it to the National Economic Council for handling, in order to seek long-term benefits for the people of Guadong.</p>

He has several acres of land, which have been damaged by disasters. This spring, he lacked rice seeds and ordered his grandson to ask for a loan from relatives in Baoying, but was unsuccessful. He felt that there was no joy in life and that life was extremely difficult, so he harbored the thought of ending his life. On the night of the eleventh, he hanged himself in his room. It is truly tragic.</p>

<p>Fisherman Zhu Chongkun of Dagang Port, Yin County, and four or five companions sailed to the outer sea to fish a few days ago. They caught over a thousand catties of fresh goods and transported them back to Daishan Chongbing for sale. However, when the boat reached the Simaen ocean area of Xiangshan Port, it was suddenly robbed clean by pirate ships. Another fisherman, Zhu Ayuan, also had 12 yuan in legal tender, clothes, and over a hundred catties of ramie stolen. According to statistics, no fewer than five or six fishing boats have been robbed one after another.</p>

<p>— Chen Kezhong, Full-Time Translator at the National Compilation and Translation Bureau</p>
<p>Chemistry has a very close relationship with human life. The four basic needs of life, "clothing, food, housing, and transportation," and the various tools a nation needs for survival are almost all dependent on chemistry. Primitive humans only used leaves to cover their bodies and keep warm, ate raw meat and blood to fill their stomachs, built nests in trees to live, and traveled without boats or vehicles. But human intelligence is like a huge ship, continuously advancing with time. Such primitive humans can no longer exist in the world. Modern humans not only use clothing to keep warm but also use it to represent the level of civilization, as the ancients said, "clothing to adorn the body." When it comes to "adorning the body," the most important thing is the color of the clothes, and the dyes that express the colors rely on chemical research. As for food, it's not just about filling the stomach. We also need to study which foods are most effective for the body's nutrition and how to eat them without hindering health. These questions can only be solved through chemical research. Speaking of housing, so-called "cave dwellings" are certainly wrong, and even old-fashioned bamboo huts and thatched cottages are outdated. The main materials for modern houses are bricks and cement, and the manufacture of these two things also requires chemical research. As for transportation, the asphalt paved on the roads, the steel and cement needed to build bridges, the railroad tracks, and the raw materials used to manufacture various ships, vehicles, airplanes, etc., mostly rely on chemical research. Even the fuel that drives these means of transportation needs to be solved by chemists. In addition to clothing, food, housing, and transportation, maintaining health is also extremely important for human life. The medicines for preventing and treating diseases can only be obtained through chemical research. As for a country, to defend against attacks from others and ensure national peace, all the necessary tools also rely on chemistry. From these facts, we can see that chemistry is the source of human intelligence and the key to modern culture.</p>
<p>Since the uses of chemistry are so broad, it is certainly impossible to cover everything in a short time. Now, I can only discuss a few important issues with you.</p>
<p>Regarding the Issue of Food: Food and drink are the main problem of life. If the problem of food cannot be solved, all other aspects of life cannot be discussed. From a chemical point of view, this problem can be divided into two aspects: one is the problem of food production, and the other is the problem of food nutrition.</p>
<p>The problem of food production: Most of the major foods of mankind are derived from plants. The growth of plants is mostly maintained by nitrogen. Air is composed of nitrogen, oxygen, and other small amounts of gases, and nitrogen accounts for more than three-quarters of the content, so there is no fear of a lack of nitrogen supply. Unfortunately, most plants cannot directly absorb nitrogen from the air; they must rely on nitrogen compounds such as nitrates to grow. We know that ammonia is produced after the decay of animals and plants, escapes into the air, is dissolved by rain and dew, and comes down to fertilize the soil. However, this amount of ammonia is too small, and plants cannot use it directly. Later, after the British Warington research, we learned that the change of ammonia in the soil depends on microorganisms. These microorganisms attach to the soil and, through contact with the air, can promote the change of ammonia. This effect is like yeast turning sugars into alcohol. There are usually two types of such microorganisms: the first type first turns ammonia compounds into nitrites; the second type can turn nitrites into nitrates after contact with air. After becoming nitrates, plants can use them directly. Therefore, plowing and turning the soil is a very effective method for farmers, because this can turn the microorganisms and nitrites in the soil to the surface to contact with the air, so that nitrites become nitrates. People in the past only knew the benefits of turning the soil, but did not know where the benefits were. Now we understand. In addition, there is another type of microorganism that is attached to the roots of plants. The roots of plants such as soybeans, alfalfa, and other legumes have root nodules, which contain this microorganism. Therefore, when the soil that continues to grow wheat becomes depleted, as long as you switch to planting legumes or alfalfa, then the soil will become fertile again. However, this method of remediation is very limited. Most of the sources of nitrogen fertilizers rely on Chilean nitrate, but the world's population is increasing every day, and the Chilean nitrate that is relied upon is decreasing every day. Supplying unlimited consumption with limited sources will naturally lead to a shortage. Therefore, in 1899, the famous British scientist Sir Wm. Crookes once said that if everyone does not quickly find a way to absorb nitrogen from the air, then there will be a danger of famine in the world in fifty years. At that time, after his reminder, many chemists worked hard on such research, and as a result, the German Haber air nitrogen fixation method was invented. Therefore, during the European War, although Germany was blockaded on all sides and unable to import Chilean nitrate, the nitrogen needed for German fertilizers and gunpowder was not a problem. Nowadays, there is no agriculturally developed country in the world that does not use artificial nitrogen fertilizer. Everyone will understand after looking at the following statistics table (1930).</p>
<p>China's annual food imports exceed 300 million yuan, competing with cotton for the first or second position in imports. Although inconvenient transportation and uneven distribution are also part of the reason for the food shortage, it should not be so different. If something happens to the country and the seaports are blockaded, then we will be in danger of starvation. In recent years, the number of artificial fertilizer imports has also been very considerable. In 1924, the value of imported ammonium sulfate was more than 2.6 million yuan. Subsequently, it increased year by year. By 1930, the value of imported ammonium sulfate was more than 27 million yuan, an increase of ten times in seven years, with an average annual increase of 50 percent. Last year, the Yongli Company opened an ammonium sulfate factory in Pukou, with ample capital and a large scale. In the future, such leakages can be remedied to some extent.</p>

In your prime, you pursued revolution, followed the Premier, and in the southern pacification campaigns, you cast aside the pen and rose up. You rejoined the military staff, and your writing flowed swiftly, completing ten thousand words at once, striking fear into the enemy. You legislated for the capital, safeguarding the people, orderly and structured, like a net with its cords. When border unrest was reported, and incursions were alarming, your extraordinary plans could not be realized, and deep sorrow filled your heart. Your travels in Europe spanned nearly ninety thousand miles, broadly observing other nations, further spurring your own efforts. Upon your return for a brief respite, you were promoted to the central leadership. Suddenly, a mountain collapsed, shocking and bewildering us, leaving us with no way to redeem you. Ten thousand people looked up to you, the Party lost its guide, like a fleeting image without substance. The spirit of the nation must advance, never retreat. Reading these final words, we wipe away tears. We summon your soul and offer sacrifices from this coastal corner, vowing to carry out your legacy, forever steadfast and unchanging. May you accept this offering."</p>

I send this telegram to offer my condolences. Please accept my sincerest regards. Wu Tiecheng, bowing, Yuan Yin." The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, upon learning of the death of Chairman Hu Zhantang of the Central Standing Committee in Guangdong, specifically telegraphed Guangzhou yesterday to offer condolences to the Hu family, while simultaneously preparing for memorial services. The original telegram is excerpted below: "To the Hu Zhantang Funeral Committee, Guangzhou, to Ms. Hu Mulan: Upon receiving your telegram, we were shocked to learn of Mr. Zhantang's death on the [day]. The tragic news has spread, and the entire nation mourns. We deeply lament that Mr. Zhantang led the masses and contributed greatly to the Party and the nation. His sudden passing not only means our Party has lost a vital limb, but the nation has lost a guide. We hope that you, as his filial descendant, will carry on his legacy, cherish yourself, and transform sorrow. This is our earnest prayer. We send this telegram to offer our condolences and wish you well. Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, bowing, Yuan Yin." Mr. Yang Shukan telegraphed Madam Hu and Ms. Mulan the day before yesterday, saying: "Mr. Zhantang's sudden passing is deeply shocking.

Heaven is unkind, suddenly taking away a meritorious official. Gazing south, the sea clouds are dark. We hope that you will restrain your grief and adapt to the change, and strive to assist in the important affairs. We respectfully send this telegram to offer our condolences. With best wishes, Yang Hu, Special Envoy of the Chinese Seamen's Union, bowing, Cold." The Shanghai Political Science Association telegraphed yesterday, saying: "Urgent, To the Funeral Committee for Chairman Hu of the Central Standing Committee, Guangdong Provincial Government: Reading the newspaper, we were shocked to learn that Mr. Zhantang suddenly suffered a cerebral hemorrhage on the [day] evening and passed away. The tragic news has overwhelmed us with grief. We believe that Mr. Hu, in his early years, assisted Premier [Sun Yat-sen] and advocated revolution, planning and strategizing, with great ambition and dedication to the Party and the nation. He participated in the revolutionary efforts of the 1911 Revolution, the Wuchang Uprising, and declared independence in Guangdong, contributing greatly to the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the founding of the Republic of China, with outstanding achievements, truly a meritorious official of the Party and the nation, and a leader of the nation. Since leaving his position as President of the Legislative Yuan in the 20th year [of the Republic], although he retired to Guangdong, the people of the nation still longed for his resurgence. As the Sino-Japanese conflict arose and national disasters occurred frequently, Mr. Hu advocated unity with sincerity and resistance to foreign aggression, hoping to protect our country from harm, and was supported by the people of the nation. At this time of national peril and political turmoil, we rely on your talent to sit in the central government and consolidate our foundation. Therefore, the nation rejoiced at Mr. Hu's return. We hoped that he would soon enter the capital to preside over the grand plan. However, Heaven did not grant our wishes, and a bright star suddenly fell. Alas, the death of a person means the decline of a nation. Considering this, we feel deeply the sorrow of the Yellow Springs. Although Mr. Hu died far from his ambitions, he traveled through the vast sky, his achievements shining brightly for thousands of years. We hope that the people of the nation will look up to the virtuous and continue his legacy, which will be enough to console his spirit in the afterlife. We also ask that you convey our condolences to Mr. Hu's family, restrain their grief, and follow the proper etiquette. This is our sincere hope. We send this telegram to offer our condolences. Wang Jingwei, Yang Changjun, Xiao Enfen, Secretaries-General of the Shanghai Political Science Association, bowing, Cold, 印."

After returning to the country, Mr. Hu advocated national unity and united efforts to save the country. We must strive to carry on Mr. Hu's legacy in the future. I originally intended to go to Guangdong to offer condolences, but my internal wound on my right cheek has not yet healed, so I may not be able to go. It depends on the healing situation in the next few days. Regarding the draft constitution, Mr. Wang declined to express his opinion, only saying that he hoped to know the public's criticism.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Jiaotong University President Li Talks About His Impressions of Visiting Suzhou and Wuxi <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>President Li of Jiaotong University recently visited Suzhou and Wuxi for inspection. After returning to the school, he made various suggestions to the teachers and students of Suzhou and Wuxi. He said, "I visited the Suzhou and Wuxi area four years ago. At that time, transportation was convenient by railway, but now there are more highways. This is a clear demonstration of the progress of China's construction, which directly and indirectly increases benefits to society. I traveled by car and saw and heard more in the countryside and cities. I felt that the climate and geography of Jiangsu are truly capable of development. Why worry about poverty and weakness? It is a pity that with sufficient food and clothing, etiquette and righteousness are not promoted, and loyalty, courage, diligence, and hard work are diminished. In the so-called scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants, I found weaknesses of laziness, disunity, and apathy, which is truly regrettable. Those who are even slightly well-fed mostly do not engage in production, but spend their time in teahouses in the morning and evening, or play mahjong at home. There are few producers and many consumers. Who is to blame? Even in prosperous areas, there is still the problem of difficult livelihoods. In terms of growth, the countryside and the city do not cooperate in education and defense, and even among the countryside, there is no mutual assistance and promotion. In terms of occupations, scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants each pursue their own interests, without unity. As for the progress of society and life, they seem to be unaware of or indifferent to national affairs. They do not talk about them when asked, and do not answer honestly. The national spirit is so scattered and disrespectful. In the countryside and cities, I also saw many disabled and sick people. Even among the working class, their bodies did not seem very strong, and some had sickly appearances. This is a national problem that is of great concern. I have heard that a weak country comes from a weak countryside. We must immediately remedy these shortcomings, but empty words are useless. To truly implement them, we must first know how to solve them. In my opinion, the people can be guided, but they must also be informed. Therefore, the systematic establishment of civil training classes, life improvement training classes, and economic construction training classes is an urgent task. If things depend on people, then before running these training classes, there must be adequate talent. To obtain adequate talent, it seems that the Party, government, military, and academic circles should jointly plan and proceed."</p>

<p>Since the City Public Safety Bureau began accepting reports of smokers and allowing supplementary registrations in this city on the 10th of this month, the work has been extremely intense. Many smokers who had previously failed to register have been flocking to the bureau's various branches and teams to request registration for licenses and to register for smoking cessation. According to the bureau's statistics, from the 10th of this month to yesterday (the 14th), within four days, the number of people who registered for licenses totaled 851, and 135 smokers were sent for smoking cessation. Regarding the establishment of private opium dens and private smoking, the bureau has also assigned inspectors to conduct inspections in various districts. Recently, dozens of smoking cases have been investigated and handled daily. The bureau is currently conducting separate interrogations. In addition to sending those who opened opium dens to the Songhu Garrison Command for legal punishment, unregistered private smokers will be ordered to obtain licenses or sent for smoking cessation and then released, in accordance with the measures during the reporting period. Furthermore, the bureau has set the period from April 1st to May 31st of this year as the deadline for renewing the second-term licenses. With only half a month left until the deadline, and many still haven't renewed their licenses, the bureau has specially formulated measures for inspecting smokers and license renewals. It has ordered all branches to begin inspections on the 10th of this month until the end of the license renewal period on May 21st. Since the inspections began, the number of people renewing their licenses has also increased sharply compared to before.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Commodity Inspection Bureau Expresses Views on Preparations for Hide and Leather Inspection <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>It was reported in the newspapers recently that the City Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Industry, requesting a postponement of the implementation of hide and leather inspection. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, considering this matter related to inspection policy, visited Mr. Cai Wuji, Director of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, to inquire about the details and future measures. He was given a detailed account, which is recorded below: (The following is Director Cai's statement) The preparation for hide and leather inspection can be discussed from the standpoint of inspection policy and practical needs separately. From the standpoint of inspection policy, the Tianjin and Hankou Inspection Bureaus have long been inspecting exported hides and leathers. The Shanghai Bureau, as an inspection agency affiliated with the Ministry of Industry, should naturally implement inspection for commodities of the same nature in order to ensure the uniformity and comprehensiveness of inspection policy. As for practical needs, in today's foreign trade, only commodities of excellent quality can gain international credibility and expand trade. However, Chinese merchants often adulterate exported commodities, with many malpractices. In the case of hides and leathers, for example, second-class goods are mixed with first-class goods, goods produced in area A are falsely claimed to be from area B, and those with insufficient dimensions are stretched by soaking in water, etc. These malpractices are endless. Moreover, the adherence to traditional methods of tanning and packaging without improvement is an additional problem. If these situations are not supervised, rectified, and improved, it will be difficult to maintain a position in the international trade arena for a long time. Therefore, the need for inspection is very urgent in practice. As can be seen from the fact that well-known foreign firms and trading houses engaged in the export of hides and leathers in Shanghai often express their opinions to the bureau and request the prompt initiation of inspection. After the preparation began, the bureau sent personnel to investigate and study the matter, drafted detailed inspection rules, and solicited the opinions of the trade association, hoping that both inspection policy and commercial conditions would be taken into consideration and that the handling would be perfect. On April 21st, a letter was sent to the association requesting them to send representatives to the bureau for a meeting to make a final decision. When the letter was sent, it was addressed to Mr. Lu Qinglai, Chairman of the Shanghai Hide, Leather, Oil, and Bone Trade Association, as the association's submissions were always signed by him. At the meeting, Mr. Lu and Mr. Yuan Meiqing attended, and their attitude during the discussion was very good. However, afterwards (the association suddenly sent a letter denying it), and the letter only bore the association's seal without the signature of a responsible person. How the truth is in this is very puzzling. The association asked the City Chamber of Commerce to telegraph the Ministry of Industry, claiming to represent the entire industry, but they don't know that there are also people in the industry who are requesting the implementation of inspection. Since the industry association has requested the City Chamber of Commerce to telegraph the Ministry of Industry, the bureau will naturally report the facts to the Ministry and await instructions.</p>

<h3 id="e100">City Chamber of Commerce Instructs That Payment Slips Should Bear Stamps <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter yesterday to the Foil Industry Association, instructing that payment slips should bear stamps. [Beginning] Dear Sirs, We received your letter of the 13th of this month, requesting an explanation as to whether notification slips should bear stamps, and attached a sample to the association. Upon examination of the attached sample, it clearly states "Now sending you the sum of X yuan, and kindly acknowledge receipt for Shaoxing XX Company." This indicates that Sanhe Fubo Foil Company is using this slip to make payments, which is of the same nature as the payment slips mentioned in the remarks column of the fourth item of the stamp tax rate schedule. The person issuing the payment slip should affix the stamp. The letter states that the bank receiving the payment has a seal on the slip, which is in the nature of a receipt. This association believes that even as stated in the letter, it is a payment slip that also serves as a bank receipt. According to Article 8 of the Stamp Tax Law, if the tax rates are the same, only one type of stamp should be affixed. The payer issues the payment slip first, and the recipient seals it later. According to the provisions of Article 5 of the Implementing Rules of the Stamp Tax Law, the stamp tax ticket should be affixed to the document subject to stamp tax before it is delivered or used. Therefore, the foil company making the payment should affix sufficient stamps before delivering or using this payment slip. In any case, the responsibility cannot be shirked onto the person who seals the receipt.</p>

<p>Since the Committee of the China Aviation Association for Expanding the Aviation Patriotic Movement in Shanghai to Raise Funds to Purchase Airplanes to Present to the Government as a Commemoration of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Fiftieth Birthday began soliciting promoters, the response from various organizations and individuals has been very enthusiastic.

This shows the enthusiasm of all sectors in supporting their leader and supporting the aviation patriotic movement. Also, the association received a donation of 20 yuan from Yang Meinan yesterday, and 13 yuan from all students of Yangxin Elementary School, all of which were acknowledged with thank-you letters. Furthermore, the Fuan Amusement Park transferred the revenue from its business on the 13th (the previous day) to purchase airplanes for birthday celebrations. The Peking Opera Theater, Shanghai Opera Theater, elevator tickets, and front and rear door tickets totaled 138.36 yuan in national currency, which is admirable for their enthusiastic support.

<p>According to Guomin News Agency, recently, various circles in the city have received a leaflet attacking Mr. Wang Xiaolai, General Manager of the Shanghai Fish Market, signed by the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce. A reporter from Guomin News Agency specially visited Mr. Jiang Huaisu, Secretary-General of the City Party Headquarters, yesterday to inquire about everything. He was told that there is no legitimate organization called the Federation of Industry and Commerce in the city. As for the contents of the leaflet, they are all insinuating and completely slanderous against Mr. Wang, to the point that they are not worth refuting. It is well known that Mr. Wang is enthusiastic about social undertakings. Right and wrong will be judged fairly by the public. Anonymous slander will not harm him in the slightest. Mr. Wang issued a statement yesterday, willing to resolve the matter through legal means. If the anonymous slanderer is found, they may face sanctions.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Bank of China Research Office Revises National Bank Yearbook, Scheduled for Publication in September... Pre-Orders Now Being Accepted <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Economic Research Office of the Head Office of the Bank of China has been making unremitting efforts in economic research. The various books it has compiled have made many contributions to economic research. Previously, in view of the fact that China's banking industry lacked comprehensive and systematic records and statistics, it began compiling and printing the National Bank Yearbook in 1934. After its publication, it was widely praised by all sectors as the only reliable reference for studying the banking industry. After the second edition of the Yearbook was published last July, it resumed its work on the third survey and compilation, which took nearly a year to complete. The compilation method has also been greatly reformed, and efforts have been made to ensure that the inspection and application are accurate, complete, and convenient. The reporter, considering that this work is attracting attention from the financial community, specially visited the person in charge of the office. He was told that this is the third edition of the Yearbook since its publication. After the first two editions were published, corrections were sought from experts and banking authorities at home and abroad in order to be practical. They were generous with their advice, either praising excessively or providing detailed compilation guidelines and strict criticisms. The office studied them and made some additions to the second edition. This year, the survey method and compilation content were revised to meet the original intention of compiling the Yearbook. The main points of the revision are as follows: The Yearbook was originally divided into two parts, main and supplementary, with a total of sixteen chapters. The main part had ten chapters, which were purely records of Chinese-owned banks. The supplementary part had six chapters, which were records of financial institutions other than Chinese-owned banks, such as foreign banks, trust companies, savings associations, silver companies, money shops, pawnshops, and treasury houses. This year, in response to factual needs, attention was paid to the investigation of financial conditions in various places, so it was specially revised into three parts: upper, middle, and lower. The upper part is an overview, with ten chapters. The middle part is a financial survey of various places, with eight chapters. The lower part is statistics, laws, and regulations, and others, with six chapters, for a total of twenty-four chapters. The upper part, the overview, has a total of ten chapters: Chapter 1 is a chronicle of major banking events; Chapter 2 is on central and chartered banks; Chapter 3 is on provincial and municipal banks; Chapter 4 is on commercial banks; Chapter 5 is on savings banks; Chapter 6 is on agricultural and industrial banks; Chapter 7 is on specialized banks; Chapter 8 is on overseas Chinese banks; Chapter 9 is on foreign banks; Chapter 10 is on other financial institutions. Classification by category seems more reasonable and convenient for inspection. The middle part, the financial survey of various places, has a total of eight chapters: Chapter 11 is on the nine major cities; Chapter 12 is on East China; Chapter 13 is on North China; Chapter 14 is on Central China; Chapter 15 is on South China; Chapter 16 is on Northeast China; Chapter 17 is on Northwest China; Chapter 18 is on Hong Kong and abroad. A place name index is attached at the end of the chapter. The lower part, statistics, laws, and regulations, and others, has a total of six chapters: Chapter 19 is on banking statistics; Chapter 20 is on banking laws; Chapter 21 is on banking regulations; Chapter 22 is on banking annual reports; Chapter 23 is on banking logs; Chapter 24 is an index of banking treatises. The list of banking personnel in Chapter 7 of the original main part has been deleted completely because it has been scattered in various chapters and the data this year has increased significantly in order to save space. Those who have the first and second editions of the Yearbook are sufficient for inspection needs. The classification of Chinese-owned banks in the upper part is different from the previous two years. The previous two years were only statistical classifications, while this year is a compilation classification, and the convenience of consultation must be taken into account. Moreover, because the names and businesses of Chinese banks often do not match completely, the compilation and division are also very difficult. After comprehensive investigation of the characteristics of the names and businesses of various banks, they are divided as described in the first item. Secondly, the foreign bank part restores the national compilation method. The assets, liabilities, and profit and loss statements of each bank in the upper part were limited to one year in the first and second editions, that is, the number of 1934 was published in 1935, and the number of 1936 was published in 1937. Readers feel that this time distance seems too long, and there is a lack of a sense of satisfaction when consulting. The reason for this is that the settlement of accounts of each bank is not convenient for publication until after the meeting, and the timing varies, even after June or July each year; two, the issue is paid in March and April. It is printed in , makeup is not enough to publish the latest numbers, and now that the stock markets of the banks have been brought forward, the collection of the tables is easier, and this year it has been decided to publish the numbers for 1934 and 1935 to supplement the existing definite opinions. The publication time is therefore slightly delayed by thirty or forty days. The business statistics in Chapter 19, Banking Statistics, were also limited to one year. This year, all the numbers from 1932 to 1935 have been compiled separately for comparison. The banking regulations published in Chapter 21 are completely different from those published in the first and second editions, which readers can study. The publication of banking annual reports in Chapter 22 began in the second edition, so the original publication reached six years. Now, all annual reports of each bank in 1935 are published uniformly, and the number of banks has also increased. The local financial surveys in the previous two editions were generally communications and reports from the branches of the bank. However, in some important commercial and financial centers, the bank did not have any branches, so they were all missing. This year, since attention is paid to local financial surveys and it is not possible for the branches of the bank, it is not permitted to send personnel directly to investigate, so special letters are sent to colleagues who have branches to investigate on their behalf, but there are many difficulties in the full survey. , so first select more than thirty of the most important ones and send letters soliciting contributions as a test. Since March, except for one or two places, they have all provided detailed investigations and replies, which can be said to be a major gain in the content of the Yearbook. It is learned that the Yearbook is now being printed one after another and is scheduled for publication in September. Pre-orders are now being accepted, and in order to strive for popularization, the fixed price of eight yuan has been changed to six yuan, and the pre-order price of five yuan has been changed to four yuan, reducing the burden on readers by more than 20%.</p>

<p>In addition, more than ten patient ambulances from the clinics, offices, and the Municipal Health Bureau will patrol the roads in various districts from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily. They will stop in traffic hubs and places with high pedestrian traffic to administer compulsory vaccinations. If cases of cholera are discovered when necessary, they will be immediately rescued and sent to designated hospitals for treatment. At the same time, the concession authorities have also designated districts to be responsible for carrying out the campaign, it is said.</p>
<p>Health Bureau Public Notice</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau issued a public notice to citizens, saying, "Summer has arrived, and it is again the time when cholera (medically called cholera) threatens people. Listen to the guidance of this bureau to avoid harm. Please implement the following measures, which are guaranteed to be beneficial and harmless: You should get a cholera vaccination. This bureau provides it free of charge. Flies easily carry cholera microbes. Do not eat anything that flies have landed on. Everyone should kill flies. Do not drink unboiled water, as it may contain cholera microbes. Do not carelessly eat cut fruits, or Holland water, ice cream, or sour plum juice made with raw water, to avoid bringing trouble into your stomach. Do not mingle with people who have cholera. Send people with cholera to the hospital immediately for treatment. If you feel even slightly unwell, see a doctor immediately. Do not pick at your skin or take medicine without consulting a doctor. Do not sleep outdoors. When sleeping, cover your abdomen with clothing or other items. Discharges from patients (vomit, feces) should be treated with lime water for one or two hours before being poured into the sewer. Do not pour them indiscriminately, as they contain invisible microbes that may still be alive and harm others. If everyone can diligently implement the above methods, cholera will have difficulty harming people. Regarding the matter of getting vaccinated, since you cannot do it yourself, this bureau will send people to do it for you. After the vaccination, your body will develop a resistance to cholera. If you do not encounter cholera microbes, you will naturally not get cholera. Even if you accidentally encounter cholera microbes, the illness can be mitigated. This bureau is helping you protect your health, and it does not cost you a penny. Why not come for vaccination soon? Now that it has been explained in detail, everyone please come quickly for vaccination. Each person should be vaccinated twice. After the vaccination, the injection site may be slightly swollen or painful, or you may feel slightly unwell. This is because your body has already developed resistance to cholera. It will be better in a day and will not be a problem. Please rest assured, and follow the guidance of this bureau to avoid the tragedy of getting cholera and losing your life. If you can help this bureau explain the above words to illiterate people, your merit will be great. Please implement it yourself, and advise everyone to get cholera vaccinations to avoid getting cholera. Everyone should get a vaccination before getting cholera, as it will be too late once you get cholera. Each person should get two injections. This bureau understands that workers are busy with their work and may not have time to take care of their own disease prevention methods, so this bureau will send people to various factories and groups to give injections free of charge. It is hoped that the staff and foremen of various factories will enthusiastically encourage this. This is not only your duty, but also a beautiful virtue of human benevolence and mutual assistance. Regarding this matter, it can be seen whether the managers, staff, and foremen of various factories are concerned about the health of the workers. If you truly care for the workers, you will surely enthusiastically encourage them, and the workers who get vaccinated will naturally be enthusiastic. It is hoped that the managers, staff, and foremen of various factories will pay more attention to the health of the workers and encourage them to get preventive vaccinations, which is of utmost importance. All citizens can go to the doctors or hospitals entrusted by this bureau near them to get cholera vaccinations (all have signs of various preventive vaccination locations hanging in front), free of charge. Also, for any gathering of thirty people, you can first report to this bureau, schedule a date for doctors to come for vaccination, also free of charge. This bureau is completely maintaining the health of our citizens, preventing the harm of cholera, hoping that everyone will accept the advice and get cholera vaccinations. In addition, everyone should also pay attention to hygiene."</p>

<p>The 1st District Ship Management Office of Zhejiang Province recently drafted a method for steamship merchants to store fuel, along with an appended guarantee, using administrative power to force shipping merchants to sign and acknowledge it. The Shanghai Inland River Steamship Industry Association, after receiving reports from its members, has already telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction, requesting that they take into consideration the difficulties of merchants and exempt them from storing fuel. This has been reported in previous newspapers. According to reliable news from the inland river shipping industry, since the Ship Management Office of the district announced the above-mentioned storage method, shipping merchants in Huzhou, Pinghu, and other counties under its jurisdiction have been greatly alarmed. Regarding the matter of being forced to sign the guarantee, they believe it is an insult to the dignity of shipping merchants. Public sentiment is very indignant. If the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction does not provide proper relief for the aforementioned method, various shipping merchants operating in Zhejiang Province will be summoned to Shanghai in the future to hold a meeting to discuss effective countermeasures. Their attitude is extremely intense, it is said.</p>

<p>At the Sande Tea House on Zhongshan Road in Zhabei, at around 9:30 PM on April 11, traces of burglary were discovered. Patrol Officer Li Yiqian and Sergeant Fu Yongkang of the Baziqiao Police Station led a large number of police officers to arrest the burglars. They engaged the bandits, exchanging fire for twenty to thirty rounds. One bandit was shot. The bandits were outnumbered, and Dong Jingzhai, Qi Defu, Xiao Fulong, and Jiao Furong were arrested on the spot. A six-round automatic pistol and four bullets were seized. Two unexploded grenades released by the bandits were found. Subsequently, another bandit, Zhao Debiao, and his mistress, Bu Sanyuan, were apprehended. A Mauser pistol bullet was also found. Bandit leader Li Shouheng, who was the squad leader of the Pengpu District Defense Corps, escaped after the incident. The details of his arrest and delivery to the bureau for interrogation by the Defense Corps have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that one of the bandits shot was Wang Rongfu, a native of Funing, 29 years old, who was shot five times, once in the neck and twice in each leg. He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. After more than twenty days, his injuries gradually healed. Unexpectedly, the bandit Wang, fearing punishment, took advantage of the lack of supervision the day before yesterday in the deep of night, and used a piece of broken lead skin bowl to cut his genitals in an attempt to commit suicide. He was discovered bleeding from his wounds. The Public Security Bureau, upon hearing this, ordered Liang Fuchu, the chief of the North Station Branch, and Gu Liancheng and Guo Mengqu, the leaders of the Investigation Detachment, to dispatch investigators Kong Rongsheng and Hu Daoxi to the hospital at 5:30 PM the day before yesterday, together with Western Detective McCutcheon and Chinese Detective Pang Qing of the Laoza Police Station, to take the bandit Wang into custody for interrogation by the Investigation General Team.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Husband's Physiological Defect; Wife Petitions for Divorce; Court Mediation Failed Yesterday <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Li Yueying, a woman from Hangzhou, 23 years old, currently residing at No. 58 Zhuangjia Lane, Ximen, recently engaged a lawyer to file a petition with the Civil Division of the Special No. 2 Court, requesting mediation for divorce from her husband, Hu Hongxing, from Anhui (who works at the Yutai Tea House's main branch on Foch Road). The petition stated that she married the defendant in October of the 21st year of the Republic of China. Initially, their marriage was harmonious, but she later learned that the defendant had a physiological defect and could not fulfill their marital obligations. The petitioner, mindful of the fact that her parents had passed away early and her adoptive father had moved far away, endured this and did not complain. Unexpectedly, the defendant had ill intentions and gradually became indifferent to the petitioner, developing a feeling of disgust, and eventually treating her as an enemy. The petitioner, in this situation, felt that life was unbearable. Later, through the mediation of Cao Boqing, the defendant was ordered to transfer all his savings of a little over eight hundred yuan to the petitioner's name in April of the 24th year of the Republic of China for monthly interest payments, and the defendant would pay a monthly living expense of seven yuan until December of the 24th year of the Republic of China. The defendant returned to Anhui alone. Two months later, he sent a letter to his sister, Pinlan, expressing his desire to divorce the petitioner. Upon learning this, the petitioner, feeling that her future was uncertain and suffering mentally and economically, attempted suicide by drowning herself in the Dongmen Road Bund on February 14 of the 25th year of the Republic of China. She was rescued, taken to the Public Security Bureau, and sent back home. However, after this incident, the defendant still did not repent and stopped paying the monthly allowance, and regarded the petitioner with animosity, vowing to divorce. Since the defendant had expressed his determination, the petitioner had no choice but to petition for mediation for divorce, etc. The court granted the request, and yesterday morning, Judge Guo Wei presided over the mediation in the Civil Division 4. Both parties appeared in court as summoned. First, the petitioner, Li Yueying, stated the intent of her petition for mediation. Then, the defendant, Hu Hongxing, was asked if he agreed to the divorce, and he said that he could agree to the divorce, but as a merchant, he only had the amount of savings previously given, and asked the petitioner to return some of it. Li Yueying said that the savings of a little over eight hundred yuan were not enough to cover living expenses, and that the defendant should allocate more funds, etc. After repeated persuasion by the judge, the two parties refused to yield. The court then announced that the mediation had failed and ordered a formal lawsuit.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Lawyer Wen Ren'an; Has a Major Conflict with Defendant; A Disturbance in the Case of Petition for Separate Residence <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:25 PM, lawyer Wen Ren'an appeared in the First Special District Court representing his client, Lin Lingdi, a woman from Ningbo, in a case of petition for separate residence from her husband, Zhang Yongshan, from Ningbo. It is unknown how, but he suddenly had a major argument with Zhang Yongshan, and then they began to fight each other outside the door of Court 14. Lawyer Wen's glasses were also knocked to the ground. The details are as follows: Zhang Yongshan has been working at Eurasia Aviation Company. In May of the year before last, he met Lin Lingdi, a woman from Ningbo. Their friendship developed into love, and eventually they had a physical relationship. After a considerable amount of time, as their feelings reached a boiling point, they asked a matchmaker to arrange a marriage. They formally married at a restaurant on Wuma Road on the 21st day of the first month of the Lunar New Year last year. During the wedding ceremony, because Lin Lingdi was already pregnant, she gave birth to a son on May 29, just a few months later. Unexpectedly, a rift suddenly appeared between the couple after one year of marriage. Recently, Lin Lingdi, unable to bear her husband's abuse, hired lawyer Wen Ren'an to file a petition with the Civil Division of the First Special District Court, requesting separation from her husband, Zhang Yongshan, and the return of her jewelry. This case has already been summoned once, ordering them to attempt reconciliation outside the court. Yesterday afternoon, it was time for the continued hearing. Therefore, both plaintiffs and defendants arrived in court with their lawyers. Unexpectedly, before the trial began, Zhang Yongshan and lawyer Wen Ren'an suddenly had a conflict. Lawyer Wen pointed at Zhang and began to scold him, and then they began to fight, wrestling together. Court police officers arrived to separate them and led both parties to the judicial police station to state what happened. Because the matter was minor and neither party had suffered any serious injuries, they were ordered to leave and file their own lawsuits. Shortly after, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the interrogation in Civil Division 12. The plaintiff, Lin Lingdi, immediately submitted a case, stating that she was unable to reconcile during the adjournment because she had been married to the defendant, and her jewelry and clothes had been pawned. All of her private savings of three thousand yuan had also been used up, disregarding her family's needs. If she did not agree, she would be beaten and kicked repeatedly. She was unable to bear the pain and sincerely requested permission for separate residence, vowing not to return home, etc. Then, the plaintiff's representative, lawyer Wen, recounted in court the incident of being beaten by Zhang a moment ago, stating that the defendant was extremely barbaric. Not only did he abuse his wife, but he also insulted and humiliated this lawyer, who had never met him before. His usual behavior was self-evident, etc. When Zhang Yongshan was questioned, he completely denied the plaintiff's accusations, saying that his relationship with Lin Lingdi was always harmonious, requesting the dismissal of the lawsuit, and filing a counterclaim, requesting a judgment ordering them to live together. Judge Huang announced the conclusion of the debate on this case and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 1:00 PM on the 19th.</p>

<p>Zeng Guan'e, a Cantonese woman, 23 years old, residing at No. 28 Xiangyu Lane, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, is currently studying obstetrics under Dr. He Xiuzhen, and has been studying for only eight months. Zeng's family is poor. Unexpectedly, the woman suddenly worried that her studies were not progressing and that she was experiencing financial difficulties, and she became weary of the world. Alone, she went to Room 281 of the Delin Apartment on Chongming Road, wrote a suicide note stating the reason for her suicide and the location, and sent it to her cousin, Zeng Wenbiao. Then, she secretly swallowed sleeping pills and committed suicide. When Wenbiao received her letter the day before yesterday at noon, he immediately went to the woman's home to inform her. Together with the woman's brother, Zeng Wangyao, they went to the inn and found the woman groaning on the bed. They urgently called an ambulance to the scene and rushed her to Shanghai Sanatorium and Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective. She died the day before yesterday. The Hongkou Police Station, upon receiving the report, ordered Chinese Detective Chen Xikang to go to the scene for investigation. He then carried the body to the Fei Lun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Zhang Zongru, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, accompanied by forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, went to the morgue to examine the body. According to the report of Chinese Police Chief Zhang Yuhai, Zhang confirmed that the deceased female student, Zeng Guan'e, had indeed committed suicide by taking sleeping pills. The corpse was handed over to her brother, Zeng Wangyao, for coffin preparation and burial.</p>

<p>The Public Concession’s Public Works Department has recently paid close attention to the safety of vehicles and pedestrians on the roads. In addition to the intersections of Weihaiwei Road and Seymour Road, and Avenue Road and Jiaozhou Road, where new traffic methods have been implemented, the tram stop at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Tibet Road was reformed yesterday, moving the stop near Jing’an Temple Road by more than ten feet and the one near Nanjing Road by two feet, so as to enlarge the area at the road intersection to facilitate vehicles turning. On the other hand, wooden posts have also been nailed to the pavement at the four corners, with cables added to them, so that pedestrians who want to cross the road can cross the road farther away from the intersection. This is of great convenience to both motorists and pedestrians.</p>

<p>According to the Da Mei Evening News, this morning (the 14th) at 9:30 AM, four trucks carrying Japanese marines departed from Hongkou for a tour of the city. They were led by several officers in a military vehicle. When they drove along Sichuan Road and passed Avenue Edward, as they were about to enter Rue du Consulat in the French Concession, they were stopped by an Annamese constable because the Japanese soldiers did not have a transit permit issued by the French Police Station and were not allowed to enter the concession. For a time, onlookers surrounded them like a wall, and traffic was blocked. Later, the Japanese officer called the French Police Station. After waiting for a long time, a French constable came with the permit, and they were finally able to drive to the Chinese territory. Because they had obtained a Chinese permit in advance, they did not encounter any obstacles when entering Chinese territory.</p>

<p>The foreign taxpayers of the Public Concession passed a motion at last month's annual meeting requesting the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department to instruct the department’s Public Works Committee to investigate housing conditions within the concession and suggest ways to improve them. In order to implement this resolution, the Public Works Department Board of Directors decided to organize a sub-committee on housing problems within the Public Works Committee to investigate various aspects of housing problems within the concession, prepare a report, and submit it to the Public Works Committee and the Board of Directors. The sub-committee has now been organized and consists of six members, including Chinese members Mrs. Xia Jinlin and Mr. Guo Chengen. The remaining four members are Public Works Committee member McKinnon (Public Works Department Board Member), Kuroda, Property Committee member Peek, and Dr. Graham of the Health Department.</p>

<p>The Jia Wang Coal Mining Company had previously accumulated a large amount of debt to shorthand and other households, making it difficult to maintain operations. Then, tycoon Liu Hongsheng and others raised 800,000 yuan, and the Wang Company also contributed its original assets as 800,000 yuan. The company was reorganized into the China East Coal Mining Company Limited. The creditor rights of Jia Wang's creditors were also subject to a repayment plan. After China East continued to operate, in order to raise funds to develop new coal mines, it negotiated with Liu Hongsheng to borrow 800,000 yuan. In addition to mortgaging the new mine and paying interest monthly, it also agreed that for every ton of coal sold from the new mine,</p>
<p>A Commission of Thirty Cents</p>
<p>But that loan was not established, and the commission agreement was only reduced from thirty cents to twenty cents. Later, China East wanted to add a wharf and build a railway, ordering its former general manager, Gu Zonglin, to raise 1 million yuan, with a commission of five cents per ton of coal, with a term of three years, the same as that for Liu. However, Gu did not raise the funds, and the planned projects were not all completed. However, for the commission agreement, although some directors and supervisors opposed it, they did not agree to cancel it. As a result, internal</p>
<p>Conflict of Rights</p>
<p>Recently, creditors have intervened. Three creditors, Yuan Ji Company, Jin Cheng Bank, and Yanye Bank, jointly hired lawyer Xiang Fenling to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court against Zhang Duchen, chairman of China East, all directors and supervisors Liu Hongsheng, Xie [omitted], Xu Zhiyi, Bao Zidan, Sheng Miheng, Tian Youfu, Lu Yinfu, Li Bake, Wang Jianxun, He Jingyu, Li Baoliang, current general manager Hua Runquan, and former general manager Gu Zong [omitted], a total of fourteen people, requesting a judgment that the</p>
<p>Illegal Commission</p>
<p>agreement was invalid in order to avoid damage to creditors' interests. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Tao Dejun opened the court for trial. None of the defendants appeared in court, and lawyers Xu Shihao and others were appointed to represent them in defense. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the intent of the lawsuit, stating briefly that, according to the stipulated commission amount, it had accumulated to 610,000 yuan by last June. If it were taken away, not only would the creditors suffer, but the company would also be affected. Therefore, there were objectors at the time. Moreover, the 800,000 yuan loan negotiated by Gu Runquan with Liu Hongji and Gu Zonglin's</p>
<p>Responsible for Fundraising</p>
<p>of 1 million yuan were both said to be facts. The agreed commission of three cents per ton to Liu should be reduced to two cents, and Gu's commission of five cents per ton should be canceled. Because this kind of illegal profit-making under false pretenses is no different from extortionate interest, it should be promptly ruled and declared its agreement invalid. The defendant company will hold a meeting next month to pass important cases such as budget and final accounts. It can be concluded before the meeting, and the deposited 630,000 yuan only needs to be changed to dividends. If they are allowed to take the money, then</p>
<p>It Will Be More Troublesome</p>
<p>The defendant's behavior of harming creditors' interests is not limited to this. For example, the company contracted with a certain company to sell 120,000 tons of coal at a price of 8.6 yuan per ton, while the cost per ton was 8.594 yuan. In short, what the defendants did was nothing more than harming the interests of creditors, so they made this kind of agreement that violated laws and regulations, etc. The defendant's lawyers, Xu Shihao and others, immediately argued that the plaintiff was a creditor of Jia Wang Company, not</p>
<p>China East Company</p>
<p>When China East was formed, it was decided that the profits earned by Jia Wang [omitted] and creditors [omitted] from Jia Wang would be arbitrarily interfered with. This kind of lawsuit is not only the wrong subject, but also has no right to sue at all, requesting the dismissal of the original lawsuit. The court ruled that the case still needed investigation and ordered a continued hearing at a later date.</p>

<h3 id="e119">The Major Criminal in a Murder Case That Lasted Over Six Years Was Finally Arrested: Liu Liuguanzi Could Not Escape the Law and Was Detained Awaiting Sentencing; Wang Tingzhang Narrated the Circumstances of the Shooting to Avenge His Brother <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Wang Baosan from Funing used to handle affairs at a cleaning station in Zhabei before 1930. Due to a dispute over the profits from foul manure with Dai Ruzhao and his disciples Wang Fugang, Shi Fulin, and Liu Liuguanzi (also known as Liu Xingsan), Wang Baosan was shot to death by a barrage of gunfire on the afternoon of February 28, 1930. The Municipal Public Security Bureau successively arrested Dai Ruzhao, Wang Fugang, and Shi Fulin, and handed them over to the Shanghai Local Court for trial. According to the old criminal law for premeditated murder, Dai Ruzhao was sentenced to death, Wang Fugang to life imprisonment, and Shi Fulin to twelve years of imprisonment. Subsequently, the three defendants appealed to the Suzhou High Court, and the three-instance trial concluded with the original sentences upheld. Dai Ruzhao was executed by hanging in the Suzhou prison on June 1 of last year. Wang Fugang and Shi Fulin also died in prison one after another. Liu Liuguanzi, who had been on the run, initially fled elsewhere, but now, believing that time had passed and things had changed, he returned to Shanghai and lived with his wife in the home of his disciple Wu Xiaokaizi on Hankow Road in the Hongqiao area. However, Wang Baosan's wife, Wang Shi, had also passed away. Liu thought he was safe, but unexpectedly, his younger brother Wang Tingzhang learned of his situation. He entrusted people to investigate, and Liu gradually realized that he was being investigated and wanted to leave Shanghai again. He borrowed 20 yuan from Wu Xiaokaizi for travel expenses. Wu declined, saying that he was just a small worker and had no spare money. Liu became furious and threatened Wu, saying that if he did not lend the money, there would be days of crying. No more than three days after he said this, Wu Xiaokaizi's wife went missing. Wu, believing that Liu's threat had a hidden meaning and that he was clearly suspicious, told a friend who was a civil servant about the matter, seeking justice. His friend drafted a written statement detailing the circumstances and planned to file a complaint. He immediately handed Liu Liuguanzi over to the local police station. Because the written statement stated that Liu was a fugitive murderer, he was transferred to the Zhabei Police Station, which presented him to the Public Security Bureau and transferred him to the Local Court for detention. Wang Tingzhang also filed a lawsuit. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution, and Zhao Yongzhou, the judge, opened the trial yesterday morning. Liu Liuguanzi claimed that he was not called Liu Liuguanzi, but his original name was Liu Xingsan, and he knew nothing about the Wang Baosan case. The judge questioned him, saying that Wang Shi had provided very detailed testimony before, so how could he deny it? However, Liu insisted on denying everything. Subsequently, the witnesses Xue Ziying, Dai Xiazhang, Ji Shangwen, and Lu Xiaogouzi all testified that the defendant was indeed Liu Liuguanzi. The defendant's witnesses, Bi Changsheng, Tang Baofu, and Dai Chunshan, testified that the defendant was not Liu Liuguanzi, but his real name was Liu Xingsan. Finally, Wang Tingzhang, the brother of the deceased, testified that he lived at 9 Tianbao Road, was from Yancheng, and his sister-in-law was dead. He said that Dai Ruzhao fired two shots at his brother's death, Wang Fugang fired one shot, and Liu Liuguanzi was the most vicious, firing a total of four shots. At this point, Prosecutor Xie argued that the facts were very clear and there was no room for denial, and requested that he be sentenced according to law. The judge then declared the debate closed and scheduled the sentencing announcement for 2 PM on the 20th of this month. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>The National Products Movement Exhibition at the Penglai Market is scheduled to open on the 20th. A lottery draw and a representatives' meeting were held yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Manufacturer's Lottery Draw</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, participating manufacturers drew lots at the Penglai Garden. More than 80 manufacturer representatives were present. Chairman Liu Zhongying first reported on the preparations. After the lottery draw, Liu Zhongying reported on the numbers of each factory. Then discussions began on various matters related to the exhibition. It was decided to approve the product specifications and exhibition regulations, as well as the list of review committee members. It was also decided that the conference would handle the venue layout and publicity in a unified manner. Separate reports were submitted to the various superior preliminary competition meetings, and awards were to be presented to encourage participation. The venue construction was to be expedited day and night by additional representatives appointed by the conference to ensure the opening on the 20th as scheduled. The conference would produce the flags for each factory in a unified style. Due to continuous light rain in recent days, the conference construction had not been fully completed. The representatives' meeting decided that the conference would, in addition to the originally assigned Wu Gechang and Dai Qian overseeing the construction, also assign Ma Pingyuan and others to jointly supervise the construction in order to ensure the opening on the 20th of this month as scheduled.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Narcotics Found on Worker: 56 People Willing to Vouch for Him, Proving His Honest Character and that He Was Framed: Hearing Postponed for 7 Days to Ascertain the Facts <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Lin Yunfu, a worker from Huzhou at the Meiwen Wire Mesh Factory at No. 15, Lane 645, Xichangping Road, was arrested suddenly near Changping Road and Zhedelu at 5:05 AM the day before yesterday by two Chinese constables No. 674 and No. 1986 on suspicion. A package of heroin was found in his pocket and he was taken to the Gordon Road Police Station. Under questioning by Chinese and foreign detectives, and at the house of Zheng at No. 359, Lane 67, Xiaoshadu Road, 4 packages of heroin (each containing 10 small packages) and 7 pounds of white powder resembling baking soda were found, and were taken to the police station and impounded. Yesterday morning, he was transferred to the 8th Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The Municipal Council charged him under Article 257 of the Criminal Code with the crime of selling and transporting opium, or under Article 263 of the same law with the crime of possessing opium. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, rose to state the case, saying that the white powder and 20 grams of heroin found on the defendant and at his home had been sent to the Municipal Council's Health Bureau for chemical testing. The results have not yet been received, so a postponement was requested. However, the defendant stated at the police station that he denied having the narcotics and that he was framed by others. However, when the defendant was arrested, a park pass was found on his person, so the police suspected that the defendant may have been selling the narcotics in the park, etc. In conclusion, the defendant Zheng Lianfu stated that he was indeed framed in this matter. A fellow villager named Zhang Cai, who is addicted to drugs, often stayed at my place when he came to Shanghai. On the 10th and 12th of this month, he borrowed money from me twice without success and left unhappily, so I suspect he framed me. I myself suffer from lung disease, so every morning at 5:00 AM, I have to go to Jiaozhou Road Park to practice Tai Chi. The blue cloth clothes I wear for work are full of stains, and I am afraid of being refused entry to the park, so I wear black shorts and shirts instead. The shorts and shirts are hung on the wall at home and the enemy can plot against me at any time, etc. Finally, the defendant's defense lawyer, Shi Liang, stated that the defendant has worked at the Meiwen Silk Factory for nine years, and his conduct has always been honest and he is deeply trusted by his colleagues in the factory. He has been framed this time, so 56 workers from the same factory have come to court today and are willing to vouch for him. She requested that bail be granted. Judge Liu Yugui reviewed the confession and ordered that the case be postponed for seven days for further investigation. The defendant was ordered to be detained at the Huade Road Tilanqiao Prison.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Shin Hsin No. 9 Factory's Appeal Against Municipal General Tax Rejected: Supreme Court Upholds the Principle of the First Instance <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Shin Hsin Textile No. 9 Factory at No. 140 Macau Road in this port owed the Municipal General Tax of 11,900 yuan to the Municipal Council's Tax Office. The Municipal Council filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court. As a result, the defendant was defeated and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, but the appeal was also rejected. Shin Hsin No. 9 Factory then appealed to the Supreme Court, raising two points: 1. 15% of the factory's existing unused houses should no longer be subject to housing tax. 2. The market is depressed, and the housing tax should be reduced by 15% as an example. The Supreme Court has now ruled to reject the appeal, because the vacant houses can be used at any time and are different from those with separate and independent door numbers. Furthermore, the initial valuation of the factory's houses was 255,500 yuan, which was later reduced to 170,000 yuan. It has not been long since then, and there has been no major change in the prosperity or decline of the market. It is difficult to make a strong comparison with houses that have not previously received reduced valuation benefits. Moreover, whether or not the housing tax should be reduced, unless it has been agreed or judged by the changing party, the appeal cannot be made unilaterally. Therefore, the appeal was deemed unreasonable and the original judgment of the first instance should be upheld. It is noted that this case was initially filed in October of last year, and was ruled by the Supreme Court at the end of last month, which took more than half a year.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Almost Half of the Municipal Council's Public Bonds Purchased by Chinese: Over 4,544,000 Yuan Actually Received <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council, in order to comply with the resolution of this year's foreign taxpayer's annual meeting, issued 5 million yuan of 5.5% municipal public bonds. Now, according to the report of the Director of the Finance Department of the Municipal Council, the sale of the bonds began on May 1, and was sold out and closed by 12:00 noon. A portion of the bonds was reserved for sales in other ports. Furthermore, the original plan was to use 1 million of the bonds to increase the Municipal Council's debt repayment base for trust deposits. Now, because the actual amount received from the bonds was 4,547,600 yuan, the amount has also been reduced to about 450,000 yuan. Furthermore, there were 98 applicants for purchasing the bonds, of whom 66 purchased bonds worth 10,000 yuan or less. If the nationality is considered, the total number of Chinese purchases was 2,115,100 yuan, British 1,344,000 yuan, American 531,500 yuan, Chinese and foreign joint purchases 500,000 yuan, other nationalities 46,000 yuan, and the remaining 452,400 yuan was reserved for trust funds. The total amount is 5 million yuan.</p>

<p>It is recorded that last year, the Sino-Foreign Relief Society was greatly concerned when the Yellow River flood spread across Shandong Province.  They immediately appointed Director Lu Bohong to go and set up a branch in Jinan and Jining.  In addition to emergency relief, Mr. Lu spent 30,000 yuan to establish temporary hospitals in Jinan and other places in Shandong to treat women, children, and refugees in the disaster area.  Six medical clinics and more than twenty medical stations were established successively, saving many lives.  As it was difficult to sustain this for long, the society, along with the Shanghai fundraising efforts for the flood victims in various provinces, each contributed 5,000 yuan, allowing them to continue to this day.  However, funding is still difficult.  Yesterday, the Catholic Action Society of China, recognizing this, donated 5,368.73 yuan in national currency specifically for use by the medical stations.  Their enthusiasm for disaster relief and helping those in need is truly commendable.  Now that summer is approaching and the weather is getting warmer, the number of sick people after the disaster is increasing daily.  Although they have received assistance from the Catholic Action Society, it is only enough to barely manage until the end of this month.  They urgently hope that all sectors will continue to help, so that those in pain can be saved.</p>

<p>Last night at approximately 10:30 PM, three robbers broke into Rong Kee Meat Shop at 247 Zhili Road in the Public Concession, brandishing pistols and threatening the staff. They robbed over 20 yuan in legal tender and fled with the stolen goods. As the robbers exited, a local tenant named Zhang A'da, 42 years old, who lived in the attic, gave chase and shouted, "Robbers!" One of the robbers, bringing up the rear, held a pistol. Fearing the arrival of detectives, he turned back and struck Zhang's head with the pistol butt, causing him to bleed profusely. The assailant then fled without a trace. After the assault, Constable No. 2224 Hua Yue of the Laoza Police Station arrived and rushed the injured man to Renji Hospital for treatment by ambulance.</p>

<p>Ren Xiangyun, a 48-year-old native of Changzhou, lived in a lane house at 588 Xinza Road. He married Ms. Gu, a 22-year-old native of Changshu. The storefront downstairs was rented to a noodle shop without a sign. Ren Xiangyun himself worked as a cook for the Wu family at 35 Zhangjia Garden. Because he had a young wife at home, he would leave around 6:00 AM every morning and return around 10:00 PM. Yesterday afternoon around 6:00 PM, Ms. Ren Gu, feeling bored sitting alone, went downstairs to the shop and stood near the entrance, looking around. Unexpectedly, a man suddenly jumped forward, wielding a sharp blade, and stabbed Ms. Gu once in the left waist. He then dropped the blade and fled. The blade penetrated deep into Ms. Gu's waist, causing profuse bleeding. She fell backward, but was still able to speak. The noodle shop employees witnessed the scene and quickly helped her up, asking what had happened. She only said that the assailant was a local hooligan named Ma Mian Ni Changshou, before losing consciousness. They immediately summoned the police, who rushed her to the hospital by ambulance for treatment. However, due to the severity of the injury, she died. Her body has been sent to the coroner, and the murder weapon has been kept on file. The police have dispatched detectives to apprehend Ma Mian Ni Changshou and bring him to justice.</p>

<p>Xu Wenkui: A lone traveler, dressed in a gabardine jacket and black leather shoes, appearing young and handsome, came to Room 209 on the second floor of the Grand Shanghai Hotel in Nanyangfen Lane, Nanjing Road, the other night. He identified himself as Xu Wenkui, 28 years old. The tea attendant led him to the room, and he paid the room fee. After bringing in tea, he closed the door and there were no unusual movements. The next day at 12:51 PM, the tea attendant opened the door to inquire if he wanted anything. The traveler's face was pale and he was lying stiffly on the bed with a belt tightly tied around his neck. His limbs were cold and he was dead. The tea attendant immediately reported to the accounting department, who reported to the Laoza Police Station. An ambulance was summoned, and the body was taken to the coroner. The court will be notified for investigation. Several novels and pawn tickets were found. It is suspected that he was suffering from economic hardship.</p>
<p>Wu Huaxing: A traveler arrived at the Da Hu Hotel on Dongxinqiao Street, Sudoya Road, the day before yesterday at 4:00 PM, claiming to be Wu Huaxing, 31 years old, a native of Yancheng. He previously worked in the soy sauce industry and rented Room 210 on the second floor. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, he became despondent due to prolonged unemployment and financial difficulties and attempted suicide by secretly ingesting raw opium. The tea attendant discovered him and rushed him to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is reported that he ingested too much poison and his chances of survival are slim.</p>
<h3 id="e140">The Mongu Road Police Station; Police Chief Has Illicit Affair with Married Woman <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Li Haifeng Embezzles Public Funds and Flees; Jiang Dongbao Accidentally Discovers Secret Letter</p>
<p>Jiang Dongbao, 42 years old, a native of Ningbo, lived at 9 Dongjunji Lane, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei, where he made a living by running a small book stall at the entrance of the lane. He married Ms. Chen (named Qiaoying) over ten years ago. Ms. Chen had three sons, the eldest named Pinshan, already 12 years old. Unexpectedly, Ms. Chen was recently seduced into an affair by Li Haifeng, the chief of the Mongu Road Police Station. The police chief is also married, so there have been several domestic disputes. Although Jiang knew about it, he feared Li's power as a police officer and was concerned about his reputation, so he did not dare to speak out and had no recourse. Unexpectedly, at the end of last month, Li Haifeng instigated Qiaoying to take their six-year-old youngest son and flee. Li himself also abandoned his post and fled. Initially, he went to the home of his friend Xu Dekui in Nanjing. Xu is a police officer in the Nanjing Public Security Bureau. Later, Xu had business in Shanghai, and Li Haifeng took Qiaoying and others back to the Qingleju Hotel at the Zhenjiang West Station to stay temporarily. He then entrusted Xu to bring a letter to Qiaoying's mother in Shanghai on the 10th of this month. The letter contained ten dollars. Because Qiaoying's mother was illiterate, she took the letter to a nearby letter reader to read it. By chance, Jiang Dongbao happened to see it. Jiang snatched the letter and found that it asked his mother to find a way to trick the eldest and second sons out and send them to Zhenjiang, and instructed her not to let Dongbao know. At this point, Jiang could no longer bear it. That night, he took a letter and went to the Mongu Road Police Station to request an investigation. The Police Chief Li Ducha was already aware that Police Chief Li Haifeng had embezzled over 120 yuan in public funds and fled. He had already reported it to the Public Security Bureau and issued an arrest warrant, but did not know where the police chief had gone. After hearing the report, Police Chief Li learned that the police chief had not only embezzled public funds, but also abducted a married woman. He secretly dispatched Internal Affairs Police Chief Rong Faxi and Investigator Sun Youyi. The next day, carrying official documents, they took the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway train to Zhenjiang Station. As the investigators got off the train, it was raining. Li Haifeng was already waiting at the station. Qiaoying's mother, Police Chief Rong, and Investigator Sun, knowing Li Haifeng, got off the train and arrested him. They then cooperated with the police of the Second Branch of the Fifth Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau and rushed to the Qingleju Hotel, arresting Qiaoying and the child. They took the train back to Shanghai. Police Chief Li immediately summoned Jiang Dongbao and others. Jiang stated that he was busy with business and making a living, and had no time to litigate. He was willing to take Ms. Chen and her children back under his care. Qiaoying said that she was willing to repent and return home with her husband. Police Chief Li approved his request. However, the police chief had embezzled public funds and fled, and also dared to seduce and harbor a married woman. He was knowingly violating the law and had no regard for the law. He immediately prepared a document submitting the illegal police chief Li Haifeng to the Public Security Bureau for severe punishment, in order to maintain police discipline.</p>

Since the incident, he had been hiding in Shanghai. Yesterday morning at 10:30 AM, the Tangqiao Police Station, acting on a tip from an informant, dispatched Police Chief Zhang Fuchen and Constable Chen Yongsheng to Shanghai. They presented a document and, together with Police Officer Wang Binhui of the Lao Bei Men Police Station, arrested Zhou at the Zhaojiabang Road vegetable market. They immediately brought him to the station. After a brief interrogation by Police Chief Shen, over 30 yuan in legal tender and small denomination notes were found on Zhou.

<p>Meng Liangyuan, a Chinese constable, No. 736, of the Songshan Road Police Station in the French Concession, originally in charge of catching stray dogs without licenses within the concession, was on duty yesterday morning at 9:30 AM near the junction of the Chinese and French concessions in Tangjiawan, outside the West Gate. He saw a local woman named Jin Mei carrying a vegetable basket, selling vegetables at the Tangjiawan vegetable market in the Chinese concession. The constable teased her and was reprimanded. Meng, feeling humiliated, dragged the woman's vegetable basket into the French Concession. Lin Shizhi, a native of Zhejiang, happened to see this and stepped forward to mediate. The constable refused to listen and claimed that he was obstructing his duties. Lin argued that arresting someone across the border was illegal, and a dispute arose. The guards at the Tangjiawan Police Substation intervened to resolve the situation. Later, Lin walked south from the vegetable market in the Chinese concession, intending to meet a friend on Kangti Road. Unexpectedly, the constable, along with Chinese constable Pan Zhicheng, No. 759, and two others, arrested Lin and attempted to drag him to the police station. At that moment, the surrounding crowd protested loudly, causing a serious situation. Chinese police officers protected the two Chinese constables and took them, along with Lin, to the West Gate Sub-bureau. Afterwards, Chief Inspector Cheng Zezhou (Zi Qing) of the Political Affairs Department of the French Police Station arrived and requested to take the two constables back for questioning. Director Yao of the Sub-bureau requested instructions and was allowed to take them away. He then reported the incident to Director General Lin for review.</p>

She went to the police station to report and requested an investigation.</p>

<p>"The Pyrethrum Industry" Book Has Been Published: The cultivation of pyrethrum is a profitable emerging agricultural crop. The manufacture of pyrethrum is an auspicious industry with light burdens and heavy profits. This has been generally recognized by the people of the country. Although its cultivation is quite simple, it is still difficult to harvest a good yield if the methods are not correct. The manufacturing method has always been kept secret by industrialists, and outsiders have no way of knowing it. Moreover, our country's mosquito coil manufacturing method uses the old method, and the productivity is not high, so it cannot compete with Japan in the world market. It is urgent to study and improve it. Mr. Shi Gongshan of Shanghai has done considerable research in this field. The "Pyrethrum Industry" book he wrote, in addition to detailing the methods of cultivation and reproduction, also publicly discloses the manufacturing secrets of mosquito coils, flea powder, fly powder, mosquito killing powder, and various agricultural insecticides. It introduces new Japanese and American manufacturing, equipment, machinery, and technology, which is truly the only reference book for increasing production efficiency and improving product quality. Domestic celebrities and scholars such as Sun Ke, Ye Chucang, Chen Gongbo, and Tang Zhicai have all inscribed and praised it, promoting it as a great help to the revival of China's agricultural and industrial economy. It is reported that it has been published by the World Book Bureau, priced at only seven cents.</p>

<p>The eighth annual Shanghai Elementary School Joint Sports Meet opened yesterday at the Municipal Central District Stadium. Fortunately, the weather held, and all events were able to proceed smoothly. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Scene</p>
<p>Although the weather was overcast yesterday, nearly ten thousand students from various schools attended to watch. Although the scale of the organizing committee was small, all procedures followed those of the National Games. Therefore, the order at the venue was well-maintained. Flags from various schools fluttered in the air, their different colors quite vibrant and eye-catching. The Municipal Health Bureau specially dispatched doctors to provide first aid. The command platform was equipped with a megaphone, making all announcements clearly audible throughout the venue. Over twenty people, including Zhou Feicheng, Ma Chonggan, Shao Rugan, section chiefs Chen Bai and Mi Jifang, and Yuan Zengyu and Ding Shoutang from the Education Bureau, were present to handle hospitality matters.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>The opening ceremony took place at 10:00 AM. Mayor Wu, Director Pan, Municipal Secretary Zhang Tingrong, organizing committee chairman and vice-chairman Chen Bai, Ma Chonggan, Shao Rugan, Jiang Jianbai, and Zhang Yongchun, as well as referees Wang Fudan, Lin Yunsheng, and Li Jiyuan, and all the athletes, first marched around the field. After the music played and the flag was raised, a moment of silence was observed for three minutes in memory of the late Chairman of the Central Executive Committee, Hu Hanmin. Then, Chairman Mayor Wu delivered the opening address, followed by a report from Chen Bai, the organizing committee chairman. After all the athletes took their oaths, Lin Meiyan, the representative from the Municipal Party Committee, and Pan, the Director of the Education Bureau, delivered speeches. This was followed by group exercises.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Wu delivered the opening address, saying, "Dear students, today is the eighth annual Shanghai Elementary School Joint Sports Meet. This is the first time our Shanghai Elementary School Joint Sports Meet has been held at the Shanghai Central District Stadium. The reason Shanghai built such a large stadium and invited the National Games to be held in Shanghai last year was to promote sports in Shanghai, to awaken Shanghai society's attention to sports, and especially to awaken our parents' attention to children's sports. Elementary school is the foundation of national education, and physical education is about strengthening our bodies and making our minds and bodies healthy. Therefore, physical education is the foundation of education. If our physical constitution is not healthy or developed, then our foundation is not solid. On an unsound foundation, no endeavor can be firmly established. The foundation of a person is their physique. With a developed physique and a healthy mind and body, the education one receives will allow one to succeed in their future service to society. This is true for individuals, and for the nation, it is true that if everyone has a developed physique, the foundation of the people is consolidated, which is the foundation for building the nation and reviving the nation. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Government built this great stadium and invited the National Games to be held here last year, with the aim of actively promoting sports and awakening society's attention to sports. I hope that the achievements of the eighth Elementary School Joint Sports Meet will be better than the previous one. These are a few words of encouragement that I want to give to all the athletes and elementary school students at today's opening ceremony."</p>
<p>Director Pan's Speech</p>
<p>Following speeches by Chen Bai and Lin Meiyan, Director Pan said, in brief, "The physical fitness of elementary school students must be cultivated in schools and families on a daily basis and cannot be interrupted for even one day. The purpose of this training is not just for holding sports meets but to serve the country and the nation. The meaning of the sports meet is simply to showcase the results of daily physical training, to compete with each other, and to seek progress. In fact, every elementary school student, whether an athlete or not, should train their bodies. The meaning of the sports meet is not only to encourage everyone to pay attention to physical training but also to pay attention to the order of the venue, the discipline of the event, and sportsmanship. Everyone must abide by order and discipline, so that during the three days of the event, no school or student will engage in undisciplined or unethical behavior. Only then will the sports meet be a success. Therefore, in addition to physical training, the morality of group living must also be cultivated here."</p>
<p>Parade and Oath</p>
<p>At 9:30 AM, the opening was announced. Athletes from each district, in the prescribed order, with the Hu Nan District leading and the Zhong Yin District at the rear, led by the Public Security Bureau Military Band, with bright flags and spirited military bearing, marched around the field to the sound of music. They then gathered in front of the command platform to take the oath. Luo Shouxuan from the First District of Hu Nan represented all the athletes in taking the oath: "We hereby adhere to the spirit of promoting physical education advocated by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, participate in the competition as amateur athletes, obey the referees, and abide by all the rules of the event. This we swear."</p>
<p>Drill Performance</p>
<p>After the opening ceremony, three thousand elementary school students from various schools, all dressed in white uniforms, with the shorter ones in front and the taller ones in the back, entered the field one after another, led by their respective team leaders. They first paraded around the field for a week and then stood on the symbols indicating their positions according to the prescribed arrangement. Shao Rugan commanded the exercises, and the movements of the elementary school students were uniform and their steps were neat, earning applause from Mayor Wu, Director Pan, and all the guests. At the end of the exercises, they shouted "Long Live the Republic of China" three times, their patriotic spirit spontaneously arising, making it one of the most exciting scenes of the event.</p>
<p>Group Performances</p>
<p>Yesterday, the various schools put on over fifty group exercise performances. Among them, the German-style calisthenics of Wan Zhu, the Gong Lu boxing of He An, the dumbbell exercises of Si Shang, the "Baby Soldiers" of Cheng Dong, the walking imitation exercises of Yang Zheng, the fitness exercises of Mei Xi, the "Little Soldiers" of Shanghai, and the ingenious exercises of Cheng Zhong, were the most well-received by the audience for their neatness, beauty, skill, and liveliness. In addition, the fitness dance of Wu Ben, the Scottish folk dance of Tang Wan, and the martial arts of Jing Ye were also commendable.</p>
<p>Track and Field Results</p>
<p>Yesterday, a total of nine events, including performance groups, were held as finals. Among them, Wang Yechao from Yangjing District broke the record of 11.79 meters held by Zhang Zhaotong of Guang Gong, with a throw of 12.625 meters in the boys' Group C shot put, which was most commendable. In the preliminary rounds, the results in the boys' Group B 200-meter race were the best. Ju Weiren of Fa Hua ran 28.1 seconds, and Chen Guoyao of Te Yi ran 28.4 seconds, both breaking the record of 28.8 seconds held by Zhang Yanqing of Guang Gong. Zhao Zhongfang of Yangjing equaled the record. The results in the other events were also quite good.</p>
<p>Finals Sketches</p>
<p>In the boys' Group A 800-meter race, there were as many as thirty-seven participants. After two laps around the field, more than ten people dropped out midway. Jin Zhaosheng led all the way and reached the finish line in 2 minutes and 24.8 seconds. With effort, it would not be difficult to break the record, which was about five seconds faster. Shan Miaoquan had enough energy at the beginning, but near the finish line, he gradually became discouraged, finishing only twenty meters behind Jin Zhaosheng in second place.</p>
<p>Luo Shouxuan won the boys' Group A long jump with a jump of 5.14 meters. His posture was quite good, and he is indeed a promising talent. Wu Chunhua was second with 4.93 meters, Jin Guangyao was third with 4.69 meters, Dai Xingliang was fourth with 4.64 meters, Yao Shungeng was fifth with 4.56 meters, and Lei Rong was sixth with 4.515 meters.</p>
<p>Wang Yechao made great progress compared to his performance in the preliminary selection, breaking the record yesterday with a throw of 12.625 meters in the boys' Group C shot put. Li Baochang was also not weak with a throw of 11.20 meters. Zhang Ming was third with 11.19 meters, Gai Xiangyin was fourth with 10.20 meters, Zhong Zichao was fifth with 10.19 meters, and Xu Songlin was sixth with 10 meters.</p>
<p>Wu Fanglin's posture in the boys' Group B high jump lacked training, so after clearing 1.335 meters, he still had leg strength but could not clear the bar. Second to fourth place were all 1.27 meters, and fifth place was 1.21 meters.</p>
<p>The girls' Group C standing long jump had the most participants. Chen Yonghua jumped 2.02 meters, second place jumped 1.95 meters, third place jumped 1.93 meters, fourth place jumped 1.92 meters, fifth place jumped 1.90 meters, and sixth place jumped 1.89 meters. The differences were very small.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends from the Venue</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of the eighth annual Shanghai Elementary School Joint Sports Meet. Of all the events, the grand drill performance by three thousand elementary school students was undoubtedly the most eye-catching and spectacular scene. On a vast, verdant lawn, three thousand children in white uniforms were arranged in a highly disciplined manner in the center. From a distance, it looked like a large carpet woven with patterns, truly beautiful. When they finished each movement, applause erupted from all sides. Finally, under the leadership of the commander, the children shouted "Long Live the Republic of China" three times, their loud slogans touching the hearts of the adults. Patriotic enthusiasm instantly permeated the entire venue, leaving a deep impression on everyone.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the third day of mourning for Mr. Hu Hanmin, a founding father of our Party and nation. The national flag, party flag, and the event's flag at the venue were all flown at half-mast. Their fluttering in the alternately rainy and overcast sky added immeasurable sorrow to the festive event.</p>
<p>This was the first time that the elementary school sports meet was held at the Municipal Stadium. The number of students who attended yesterday was not small, totaling over seven or eight thousand. If it had been held at the Dajilu Stadium, it would have been overcrowded long ago. But here, except for the area around the west command platform, which was crowded with people, the north and south stands were quite deserted. This shows the capacity of this massive structure.</p>
<p>The various school gymnastics performances yesterday totaled more than fifty. One after another, they exhausted all kinds of ingenuity. It was like being on a road in Shanyin, with so much to see that one could barely keep up. In terms of the performance results, they were generally good. Perhaps they had undergone a long period of preparation beforehand. Naturally, the poor ones would not show their faces here.</p>
<p>Passing the weight check is something that athletes generally dread. Often, a slight difference can lead to the cancellation of their earned points. To ensure that they did not exceed the prescribed weight, some starved themselves beforehand, while others took off their clothes and washed their feet during the weigh-in. The situation was quite miserable.</p>
<p>Performances by kindergarten students have long been recognized as interesting events. However, yesterday there were only a few items such as Cheng Dong's "Baby Soldiers," Shanghai's "Little Army," and Qi Mei's "Little Swallows." Moreover, the costumes were more casual than in previous years. This may also be due to the impact of the economic downturn.</p>
<p>The championship system in this session takes districts as the unit, breaking the old habit of competition between schools. According to the current situation, Hu Nan and Te Yi districts are the most promising winners of the championship. He An Elementary School is the head of the Te Yi district. There were a particularly large number of cheering students from that school, perched on the side of the command platform, with extraordinary enthusiasm. Whenever they saw a student from their district win, they waved flags and shouted, their voices shaking the stands. The children's enthusiasm was unconsciously revealed.

<p>The Shanghai Public Handball Championship, organized by the Western Youth Association, originally had three doubles matches scheduled yesterday. However, Qi Ge ceded to Hua Fenggang and Yan Peiqiu, and Ge Die Dili ceded to Sun Jialu and He Shuqing. Therefore, only one match remained, between Mi Kuan and Sun Daosheng against Smith and Englu. Starting at 7:00 PM, Zhu and Sun scored two points first, but Smith and Englu tied the score. Sun Daosheng hit a baseline shot, and Zhu [Unclear] hit a difficult shot, making it 11 to 3. Smith and An worked hard to win 3 points, but Zhu and Sun were unwilling to let up, scoring another 10 points. Zhu and Sun won the first set 21 to 6. In the next round, Zhu and Sun took advantage of their momentum, taking the lead with 4 to 1. Before long, Smith and Englu caught up and tied the score. Zhu Kuan hit a difficult shot to win two more points, but Smith took three consecutive points and surpassed them. Sun stepped up his game, adding five points with a baseline smash, making it 21 to 17. Smith and Englu lost again. In the doubles competition, Zhu and Sun have won against strong opponents, and the championship will almost certainly be theirs. The final singles match between Zhu Kuan and Bowserly, originally scheduled for today, has been postponed to the 20th of this month due to Zhu Kuan's recent diarrhea and weakness. The results of yesterday's match are recorded below.</p>

After the opening, the organizing committee plans to install temporary broadcasting equipment on the east and west platforms of the venue and to request one or two radio stations to assign someone from the organizing committee to broadcast issues related to art education and venue news at a fixed time each day, so that the general public pays attention. The decision was passed, and the date will be set separately and submitted to the preparatory committee for consultation.

<p>The Boy Scout movement in this city has been under the leadership of the Party and government since 1928 and has held a citywide Boy Scout review and encampment once a year to assess past training achievements and learn lessons for future training. The first one was held in 1929, with only a few hundred Boy Scouts participating. Since then, the number of participants has increased year by year, reaching over five thousand at the sixth event last year. This year's event will continue as usual, and it is estimated that more than ten thousand people will participate. The Municipal Boy Scout Council is actively preparing for it. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Changing the Name; Specifying the Plan</p>
<p>The citywide Boy Scout gathering has been referred to as the "Grand Review and Encampment" in previous years. The scope seemed narrow, so starting this year, it will be renamed the "Grand Conference," which has a broader meaning and can encompass all Boy Scout activities. The date of the seventh Grand Conference has been set from June 5th to 9th, totaling five days. Wu Tiecheng, Tong Xingbai, and Pan Gongzhan have been hired to serve as chairman and vice-chairman. The location will be in the city center, with the camping area in the square in front of the Municipal Government. The review and course competitions, campfire and other activities will be held at the Municipal Stadium. The funds will be allocated from the municipal treasury. In addition to the review, camping, and course competitions, this conference will add labor service and emergency period Boy Scout mobilization exercises. Many experts in Boy Scout affairs have been hired to undertake design and guidance.</p>
<p>Course Competitions: Organized by Group</p>
<p>This course competition will be organized into five groups: middle school Boy Scouts, middle school Girl Scouts, elementary school Boy Scouts, elementary school Girl Scouts, and social Boy Scouts. The middle school Boy Scout group items include: First Aid, Surveying, Drafting, English Semaphore, English Single Flag, Stroke Semaphore, Bridge Building, Observation Tower, Night Navigation, and other nine types. The middle school Girl Scout group items include: Knot Tying, Observation, First Aid, English Semaphore, English Single Flag, Stroke Semaphore, Sewing, Cooking, Singing, and other nine types. The elementary school Boy Scout group items include: Discipline, Knot Tying, Singing, Morse Code Semaphore, Observation, First Aid, and other six types. The elementary school Girl Scout group items include: Discipline, Singing, Morse Code Semaphore, First Aid, Sewing, and other six types. The social Boy Scout group items are the same as the middle school Boy Scout group.</p>
<p>Convening Group Leaders: Reporting Methods</p>
<p>It is also reported that there are restrictions on participation. Each middle school and social group is limited to participating in four items, and each elementary school group is limited to participating in three items. Scores will not be counted if fewer participate. Each Boy Scout can participate in at most two competitions. All methods for the conference have been drafted and approved by the Municipal Boy Scout Council and will be issued to each group soon. It is understood that the council has scheduled a discussion meeting for all group leaders on Monday, the 18th of this month, at 4:30 PM at the YMCA on Sichuan Road to report on all methods to facilitate progress. The school board will be responsible for handling the conclusion.</p>

Subsequently, the Ministry dispatched personnel for inspection. It was reported that the board of directors had convened only once, without any records, and that management was poor. An order has been issued to immediately cease operations, with the board of directors responsible for handling the closure. All student records will be invalidated. The Ministry has already instructed the relevant authorities to direct the academy to comply and report accordingly.</p>

Although the aforementioned showed some fatigue of one or two dimes, starting from Category C, it was again propped up by maintenance efforts, turning higher by five cents to one dime. The afternoon situation followed the trend of the morning's close, and Number 11 and others seized the opportunity to push up again. Numbers 16 and 34 happened to have swap transactions, and the market was stable and firm, with a uniform rebound of five cents to two dimes. At the close, Number 11's appetite to enter the market was even stronger, improving by another five cents to two dimes.

<p>In the past few days, the cotton cloth market has been greatly excited after cotton yarn and cotton flowers rose [unclear characters] The price of white goods has risen by two and a half cents to one dime per bolt. House and guest sentiment is gradually thickening, and Eastern goods are still more active. In the past two days, Japanese merchants such as Dongmian Jiangshang Yiteng, etc., have opened up fine cloth, fine twill, market cloth, 84 cloth, and coarse cloth of various grades, totaling nearly a thousand pieces. The house market began to rise by 5 cents, and then added another 5 cents, with near months tight and far months loose. June goods are 5 cents smaller than this month.

<p>Eastern goods and woolen fabrics showed a buoyant trend again yesterday. The selling price soared significantly. There are not many formal arrivals, and smuggled goods are difficult to mail temporarily, resulting in a shortage of supply, so the market turned tight. White broadcloth, white straight tribute, spotted flannel, white rubber cloth, etc., have all risen in price. Even the large amount of Palissy that has arrived now shows an upward trend. Other things such as flowered foreign cloth, facings, and raincoat cloth have also risen. Since the market is good, brokers and peddlers are searching around vigorously, spare no effort. Therefore, the trading of Japanese merchants Yiji, Ito, Abe City, Mitsui, Iwai, Tamaya, and Yoshida has been very lively recently.</p>

<p>The flour exchange yesterday changed the margin to 500 yuan, and the flour market continued to fluctuate. In June, there were large non-industry investors interested, but the industry has always been pessimistic, so it is the purpose of both sides to compete. June is just between the handover of new and old stocks, and there will be many changes in the market price in the future. For safety reasons, the flour office has changed the margin to 500 yuan yesterday. When the market opened in the morning, it was said that the US agreement was favorable to buyers, and people's hearts were encouraged. Non-industry buyers were particularly interested, and certain large hoarders were particularly active. New hoards were also reactivated, and even the short sellers were panicked, so the opening price in the morning soared by 35 cents. Afterwards, it was once suppressed by the massive selling of factory shorts, but new hoards have always been active, except for July, and we see rises one after another, and the closing price rose by as much as 56 cents. Wheat prices are rising sharply at home and abroad. Domestic prices rose by 34 cents. The opening price of standard wheat immediately jumped up by about 1 dime. Because non-industry speculators were encouraged by the agreement being signed and the inflation of prices, they rushed to the market to buy. Floating shorts and scattered bulls also took the opportunity to compete for purchases. Although there was settlement and new shorting, it was not as strong as the buying side. Afterwards, the flour market reported a rise, and people's hearts were even more excited. In the afternoon, each plate continued to rise by 35 cents, but the arrival of spot wheat has been endless these days, and there have been throwaway sales, and people's hearts have turned downward. The factory stomach is also not prosperous, with Fuxin taking 2,500 bags, and Shandong Yaowan and Bengbu opening at 4.71 yuan, Luoyang at 4.67 yuan, which is also 6 cents to 1 dime smaller than the previous market.</p>

<p>Although fewer guest [lines] arrived yesterday, there were all urgent intentions to sell stocks. The stocks of the lines are even more active in seeking sales with the market. Therefore, although there are continued efforts by the Quanzhou and inland gangs, the market is still gradually trending downward. The higher grades of each grade continued to trend downward yesterday, by a few cents smaller than the previous market. However, Quanzhou gang appetite is still fragrant, and the inland picks cheap goods and lightly handles them. [blank space] the stomach is strong again, and the book street is small because of the river rice, and the intention to handle it is even weaker. Throughout the day, 4,204 bags of Gan rice, more than 700 bags of Taiyong rice, 226 bags of Xianghan rice, 750 bags of Jiangbei rice, and 150 bags of Siamese brown rice were opened.

<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday's source from each gang totaled more than 20 households, with more than 5,000 shi of goods. The sales market in this street is still in a sluggish state. Although Baizi has nearly 1,000 bags handled by the Dalian gang, it is still not refreshing, so the market is tired and difficult to have any characteristics. The price of Houzao Geng has been reduced by a few cents and nearly a dime. Fortunately, Bo Dao has a Baizi sales market, barely standing. Pu Yang half reduced a few cents, and Yin Bian Yuan is similar.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, there were about 30 sources from the river below. The goods on the market each went to the stomach. White Geng has a slight outlet, but the price is still small and nearly a dime. Bo Dao's sporadic transactions are sluggish, and the price is small six or seven cents. Yin Yuan is stable, and the price of White Yuan is slightly higher, while the medium price is small and nearly a dime.

Yesterday, Dalian reported a drop. The goods owners saw that the market was difficult to support, so they had to settle the deal. The price of 100 pieces of Dalian oil was 21.8 yuan, a setback of 6 jiao compared to the previous market.

<p>Yesterday, the new green tea of Luzhuang Sui'an Zhenmei was already on the market. In the morning, the foreign company's offer was too low, and the guest's asking price was slightly higher, so they could not get close. Later, the Yingfa foreign company opened a new price of 93 yuan, which was 3 yuan higher than last year, but the sales were not smooth, and the market was afraid that it would be difficult to hold it. Tuzhuang Zhenmei, only Huzhou Anding and other sources, is still easy to sell, and the rest are also trending towards stagnation. The total number of Zhenmei green tea sold in the city was more than 390 boxes, and the market situation was slightly soft.</p>
<p>According to the Tea Industry Association report, 548 boxes of Zhenmei from Sui'an Luzhuang arrived in Shanghai yesterday. After the samples were displayed, Yongfa Xiang Shengchang Sheng talked about the market and opened the price at 93 yuan, which was about 34 yuan higher than last year, but each line still thought the price was slightly higher, so they followed up. Other Zhenmei in each line is still quiet on the market. I want to see if foreign customers still do not have formal telegrams, and each line is watching.</p>

Although no private goods have been transported in recently, 2800 *pi* of private goods woven products, such as Minghua Ge and thread-woven fabrics, were shipped from North China yesterday. Although they were once detained by the North Railway Station, they were immediately released. The selling price of these goods is low, making it difficult for local silk factories to compete, so the market prospects are not optimistic. Yesterday, local silk factories purchased several boxes of No. 120 "Seeking Profit Factory" brand "Sun" bright silk at 265 yuan, several boxes of No. 100 "Flying Lion" brand dull silk at 400 yuan, and several boxes of No. 100 "Three Tree" brand dull silk at 380 yuan.</p>

<p>Sichuan preserved mustard greens have been scarce recently due to limited arrivals, with high-end varieties particularly in short supply. The supply is limited. Top-grade Leqi preserved mustard greens from the upper village are in demand in the Nanyang area. Merchants are demanding higher prices, showing signs of trying to buy low and sell high. However, the base price is already high, and merchants are mostly buying and selling on the go, not daring to speculate. Yesterday, the Juyutong trading house quoted 27 yuan for top-grade Leqi preserved mustard greens, but no deal was made, showing a stalemate. Market prices for Leqi preserved mustard greens were 26-27 yuan for top-grade, 23-24 yuan for ordinary, 24-25 yuan for top-grade Peiling preserved mustard greens, and 22-23 yuan for the next grade.

<p>The current supply of dried scallops is limited, and inventories are also low. The market originally hoped for an increase in prices. Unfortunately, sales are extremely sluggish, and there is little interest in new arrivals, causing prices to trend downwards. Yesterday, merchants in the market were selling medium-sized, fresh-colored, good-quality Northern scallops at 164 yuan, those with less vibrant color at 160 yuan, extra-large ones at 157-158 yuan, triangular ones at 160 yuan, and broken pieces at 156 yuan.

<p>— Yingzi</p>
<p>—Reminiscence of Bailing Temple—</p>
<p>Spring in the frontier regions seems to arrive particularly late. It's already late spring in March. In Jiangnan, it's said to be the time of birds flying in flocks, right? But the frontier regions have been constantly experiencing spring snow, one after another. Although spring snow isn't as cold as winter snow and melts as soon as it lands, the snow on the Daqing Mountains freezes as soon as it falls, making the climate icy cold.</p>
<p>However, spring finally arrived in the frontier regions. During Qingming Festival, a great yellow wind blew for a whole day, with flying sand and rocks striking people's faces. In the evening, it even started raining, with raindrops falling like scattered beans! Cold and hard. The weather was like that of late autumn, chilling people to the bone, making them shiver. I staggered down the street, wrapped in a woolen blanket, wanting to go home. Inadvertently, I met a group of people. The person in front, carrying a cane, wearing an indigo blue cotton gown, a middle-aged man with red pockmarks on his face, nodded. I also nodded subconsciously. Suddenly, I couldn't remember who this person being polite to me was. Later, I realized that it was that Iron Faction guy, the one who tormented my good friend when he went to Bailing last year? People are such forgetful creatures. If it weren't for his back shrouded in an "indigo blue" gown and that special countenance with pockmarks, I really wouldn't have remembered who he was.</p>
<p>Remembering that it was him, I couldn't help but be gripped by the anger of the past. This guy who prevented me from seeing the Mongolian scenery of Bailing Temple, he's running here again. Isn't he congratulating himself in that treasure country created by one of the Allied nations?</p>
<p>Past events were peeled out layer by layer like a cocoon. It hasn't even been a year since I left Bailing Temple. How could I not remember how I felt at this time a year ago, enduring humiliation alone in the Mongolian yurt in Bailing Temple, suffering torment in the Mongolian wilderness?</p>
<p>When I went to Bailing Temple, it was precisely when the × Association and the × Provincial Government were in an irreconcilable dispute over tax revenue. Because of the animosity between the two sides, the frontier newspaper, as the official newspaper of the × Government, greatly attacked and mocked the × Association. As a small employee in the frontier news industry, I certainly knew that going to the central area of the × Association, Bailing Temple, at this time would be like courting misfortune. However, due to a long-held desire to see the Mongolian scenery and the fact that I was accompanying over sixty boys and girls, I pretended to be one of the boys and girls and took the risk. I didn't expect to be recognized halfway, and the one who recognized me was this gentleman who nodded to me today!</p>
<p>After passing through the Daqing Mountains, due to waiting for two broken-down cars in the isolated city of "Wuchuan," I stayed there. I was exposed by a local acquaintance who I had met but wasn't familiar with. The next day, as soon as I left Wuchuan City, this × Association section chief with a face full of red pockmarks saw me getting on the bus and inquired about me from the temporary leader of the boys and girls. The car kept driving north, passing through the endless prairie. Ahead was still the boundless Mongolian wilderness. At this time, this gentleman with red pockmarks asked me to get out of the car. I looked around. The wilderness was a haze of gray, and the wind was howling on the prairie. Needless to say, there wasn't a single sign of human life within a hundred miles, not even a single cow or sheep. My burning desire for survival made me refuse to get out of the car. Then, the section chief suggested to me: "In order to prevent the person in charge from being unfavorable to you when we arrive at Bailing Temple, I won't let you stay in the Mongolian yurt or civilian houses." That was also to express that he was afraid I would suffer hardships.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Bailing Temple, after crossing the small river, the car stopped in front of the Mongolian yurt. The section chief asked me to do what he had told me to do halfway. In the twilight, I widened my eyes and looked around again. Besides the scattered sixty or seventy Mongolian yurts, to the west was Bailing Temple shining in the evening glow, to the east of the river were some mud houses, and besides that, there was only the half-bald mountain behind the Mongolian yurt, the vast wilderness, and I was like a baby being abandoned on it. Blown by the wind, hit by the sand, and maybe even buried in the belly of a beast if a wild animal came out at night. My desire for survival was never stronger than at this moment. I insisted that the section chief find me a place to stay. I knew that besides the Mongolian yurts, the temple, and the houses east of the river, where else could I stay?</p>
<p>Fortunately, this red-pockmarked section chief still didn't have the determination to kill me. I finally entered the Mongolian yurt under the urgent requests of some of the boys and girls. However, conditions came with it: "Until the time you leave Bailing Temple, you are not allowed to leave the yurt."</p>
<p>The next day, after being awakened by the sound of the bugle, I looked at the green sky on the dome of the Mongolian yurt from the cold bedding spread on the ground, feeling troubled: "Should I go out or not?" I hesitated. Finally, because there was no place for me to relieve myself in the Mongolian yurt, I boldly went out.</p>
<p>Ah! What good would it do to go out!</p>
<p>After looking at the "Obo" on the back of the mountain behind the Mongolian yurt and the vast prairie in front, the boys and girls all went to visit the temple. Only I was restricted by people and had to stay in the yurt dumbly. "Don't go to see the temple, if you go, you'll be arrested!" In the yurt, I felt lonely, angry, and afraid, tormented by these words that hurt my young heart. What do other people's petty matters have to do with me? However, however!……</p>
<p>In this way, I spent half a day in the Mongolian yurt, reading to pass the time that felt especially long. Now, looking back, reading in the Mongolian yurt is probably an opportunity that I will never have again.</p>
<p>Except for being forced by loneliness to bravely take a look at the east of the river, I only mixed with the boys and girls in the evening to listen to a burst of Mongolian music and singing, and I also went with the boys and girls to see the yurt of a certain prince where the statue of "Genghis Khan" was enshrined. Besides that, I couldn't even see the Mongolians riding horses.</p>
<p>Until the morning of the third day when I left Bailing Temple, this red-pockmarked section chief was still explaining to me. Even at this time, he was still explaining to me. I really didn't know what his psychology was at that time.</p>
<p>Sitting in the original car again and leaving Bailing Temple, looking at the yellow flags waving in front of the Mongolian yurt, my eyes were filled with tears. I wasn't sad about the grievances I had suffered. I was going back with a heart full of regret. I was thinking about whether I would have the chance to come to Bailing Temple again to see the Mongolian scenery! Would the cruel reality allow me to come again?</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>In this bleak and rainy season, I actually reunited with this red-pockmarked section chief. In this cold rain, my heart burned even more like it was doused with oil. The scene of Bailing Temple appeared before my eyes again.</p>
<p>I once said: "Why should one feel regret for not seeing Bailing Temple, which is often seen like the Guihua Sheritu Zhao Temple!" Now, I deny my words. That is Mongolian scenery! Moreover, in today's world, will people still allow me to go to Bailing Temple to see it?</p>
<p>But suddenly, I thought about this red-pockmarked section chief who was enjoying happiness in the kingdom under the kingly way paradise, and now he actually ran to this place. Thinking about the day when this place would also become a "kingly way paradise," my heart couldn't help but shiver in the cold rain.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Exodus <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Xicen</p>
<p>Walking, watching groups of people leave this ancient mountain city. In a blink of an eye, it's already October.</p>
<p>Getting up early in the morning, I often go up to the city walls. Gradually, I can see the mountain colors all around. In some places, they have long turned from distant green shadows to solid dark blue. This is a sign of autumn. It seems that wherever autumn's footsteps tread, the colors fade. In fact, it's just that the leaves on the mountain trees have fallen off. In a few more days, I'm afraid this dark blue will reveal the scorched red or yellow again.</p>
<p>"Depart, depart..."</p>
<p>Hearing such orders, issued from my own fingers. Every time I finish such work, I can't help but lean back in my rattan chair and think. Yes, once: the day we leave is really getting closer. In the past few days, several overly nervous companions have been packing up their odds and ends. Immediately, this courtyard is filled with chaos everywhere, which carries with it the desolation of all departures.</p>
<p>I have lived in this mountain city for almost two years. Although there is gray everywhere here, people are just wrapped in gray, living a hard and bleak life. Collapse, bankruptcy, even in the mountains, people often talk about recent decline. I dare not imagine; what color is on the faces of people who eat rotten vegetable leaves or bark as food. Therefore, every time I hear about the methods of harassment by the ×× in the countryside, such as beatings, extortion, ... I am always very angry. Piglets, piglets, it's really not a human life! It's too gray here, and I sometimes yearn for the distance.</p>
<p>The date of the real departure is before my eyes, and I can't help but feel reluctant to part. Last night, I even saw two companions running up the city walls to wind around, looking at the distant mountains, very disheartened.</p>
<p>Last night, it revealed the taste of the eve of departure. At first, as soon as it got dark, I still wanted to go talk to them. But I pulled open every screen door, and there wasn't a single figure inside.</p>
<p>"The ghosts have grabbed them..."</p>
<p>As a result, I fell into a drowsy sleep out of loneliness. Later, I remembered that they must have each gone to their respective mistresses. From this, I connected to this mountainous area that I had clearly understood in the past two years. It's simply a piece of soil with not a bit of stickiness in the middle, resulting in poverty everywhere. This is just a simple mountain town. Although I don't know how far the city walls are, walking around the entire circle every evening, calculating it, wouldn't take more than half an hour. Yet even this simple little place is full of darkness. Thinking of the cruelty of those who exploit the flesh, I can't help but think of the pity of selling my soul.</p>
<p>Being dissolved by a kind of poison here, under the oppression of the ××, people have no freedom to breathe loudly.</p>
<p>Once, a very extraordinary event occurred. A junior officer in the team went missing. As a result, a day later, his body was found abandoned in a grove of trees outside the south gate after being murdered. Above, there were villagers in the mountains... He squeezed out. Of course, there was also a bit of romance interspersed in the middle, but I would say it was more like crude lust. But this confession has been hidden all along. Now that we are about to leave, I suppose only we ourselves know about it, apart from the murderer.</p>
<p>A night of dissipation is naturally easy to get through. As soon as dawn breaks, we will have arrived at the day of departure.</p>
<p>Behind my house to the north is a large forest. I vaguely heard it in my dream. There was the sound of bells of... very relaxed; ringing once, ringing once. There were also footsteps coming and going. But that was even lower and softer. You couldn't hear it clearly unless you held your breath.</p>
<p>White light permeated the window paper. People outside started bustling about, and the sound of talking quickly passed by, as if everyone was busy walking.</p>
<p>Regarding departure, I didn't bear any responsibility except for the obligation to obey, sit on the... and leave this place. So, whether I got up early or late didn't matter much. But looking at the empty house with only one or two rickety chairs left, I didn't want to sleep anymore. So I got up and watched my followers fasten my luggage, bedding, and quilt to the designated... Immediately, the mood of waiting for departure was quickly submerged by the early cold in the mountains. Looking at the chrysanthemums planted in the center of the courtyard, all... I felt very sad. So I quietly walked out the door with two companions who were cheerful and had no tasks.</p>
<p>It was extremely deserted in front of the gate. No soldiers were shouting "Salute" at you anymore. Only a group of children stood across the street, their eyes wide with surprise.</p>
<p>We walked down the street in the early wind, wrapped in coats. Finally, we arrived at the small tavern where we often went to drink.</p>
<p>"One last time, buddy..."</p>
<p>The three of us had this feeling. We looked at each other, but no one said anything. The waiter in the shop probably had anticipated our visit so early today. He smiled without hesitation and greeted us.</p>
<p>I knew that only today's smile was genuine, and it wasn't directed at us, but at the news of our departure today. Although they usually earn our money, ×× is contradictory: the lower they are, the more they will rely on gray clothes to do unreasonable things. Therefore, although they welcome the money we send on the one hand, they can't help but curse those more numerous brothers on the other hand.</p>
<p>People who have drunk alcohol don't feel cold, so we didn't go back and instead went straight out of the south gate to wait for them to go.</p>
<p>Standing on the stone bridge, looking at the shadows of temples on the surrounding mountain peaks, I felt a sense of awe. It was still when the peach blossoms were blooming in March. On a holiday, many of our companions had taken a trip there. I remember lying under the peach trees before sunset, looking at the downhill roads interspersed among the chaotic mountains, and imagining home. Now we are really leaving, going down the mountain. It was a foggy day when we came two years ago. Today, there should be rustling leaves on the clear autumn mountain rocks.</p>
<p>Part of the... team had already walked past. The sun also reddened half of the mountain, and kept reddening the stream under the bridge, choking low.</p>
<p>Finally, they came. My companions were all laughing and talking about how the people in the city lit firecrackers to send us off. I turned my head to look at the city walls, but they stood there silently, without any familiar traces. Sitting on the..., swaying with the sound of the bells, going up the mountain, I was still thinking about the sound of firecrackers in people's hands!</p>

<p>— Fang Yin</p>
<p>In an instant, a whole year has passed,</p>
<p>But your tomb is still the same as last autumn—</p>
<p>Let the fierce west wind blow mercilessly,</p>
<p>Let the crippled white bones be buried coldly.</p>
<p>The bloody wind swept across the wilderness,</p>
<p>Countless corpses are buried on the ridges,</p>
<p>Whether they were enemies or friends in life,</p>
<p>Now they are arranged the same way as you.</p>
<p>The sound of insects accompanies you through the eternal autumn nights,</p>
<p>Every year, the white snow fills the desolate tombs.</p>
<p>Who dares to say that the spring breeze can blow away the wild fire,</p>
<p>Will tomorrow not ignite the entire wilderness?</p>
<h3 id="e185">Bovarism <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Zhiying</p>
<p>The term "Bovarism" was coined by Jules de Gaultier. He wrote a lengthy novel dedicated to Gustave Flaubert's "Madame Bovary," extensively discussing personal Bovarism and collective Bovarism. As one of the psychological manifestations of art and literature, it is highly meaningful and refreshing to examine it to some extent.</p>
<p>Although Flaubert's "Madame Bovary" has long been translated into Chinese, it has not received widespread attention. In France, however, it is a monumental work in literary history. Flaubert himself said, "My poor Madame Bovary must be suffering and weeping in many villages in France." This is not an exaggeration. Madame Bovary is a unique character who also represents universal human psychology. In this work, romanticism and realism are intertwined. Rich imagination and realistic depiction give it an immortal artistic brilliance. This is what we should know before examining Bovarism.</p>
<p>So, what is Bovarism?</p>
<p>Gaultier believed it to be "the power of man to conceive himself as other than he is" (Le pouvoir departia Phomme de se concevoir autre qu'il n-'eit).</p>
<p>This is a psychological function of humanity at a specific historical stage. Such individuals, though possessing their own talents, sensations, and thoughts, always misunderstand their talents, misuse their sensations, and misapply their thoughts. They transform themselves and the people and things around them, resulting in comedic, tragic, and outcomes that are neither comedic nor tragic.</p>
<p>Let us dissect two or three of the main characters in "Madame Bovary."</p>
<p>Doctor Homais is a philistine bourgeois. He poses as a scientist, spouting scholarly terms, talking about everything from ancient times to the present, from east to west, south to north. He has his own prejudices, and the content of his conversations is regardless of whether others understand it or not. He has a high degree of vanity, seeing his knowledge, as insignificant as eye mucus, as great as Mount Tai. He believes in the aesthetics of realism, but due to his aristocratic tastes, he also detests the vulgarity of reality. He cannot correctly recognize what he is, just as he cannot correctly recognize external things. However, in the vulgar bourgeoisie of 1850s France, such characters were valued by the authorities and supported by public opinion. This is a caricature of the petty bourgeoisie, and Flaubert satirically portrays him as a typical vulgar bourgeois. Doctor Homais' "Bovarism" achieves a comedic outcome.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Rodolphe Boulanger is a typical representative of the "Bovarism" of the common bourgeois intellectuals. He has imagination but lacks the ability to act. His imagination either uses force to pull the object down to his own level or uses willpower to pull himself up to the position of the object. He lives every day in tomorrow. He feels anxious in his powerlessness and places his hope in powerlessness. He misunderstands his own sensibility and his own intelligence. He thinks he understands art very well and always wants to be a poet, novelist, and critic. Sometimes he pretends to be a philosopher, sometimes he pretends to be a historian, and sometimes he transforms into a politician. He is an ordinary vulgar person without comedic or tragic life behaviors, what Flaubert calls "dried fruit" (Fruite secs).</p>
<p>Madame Bovary is the most concentrated expression of "Bovarism." She is the wife of a country doctor, harboring romantic dreams, yet completely incapable. Her understanding of herself is completely wrong. She often fantasizes that she is the protagonist in a romance novel, but in reality, she is entangled in that ordinary reality. Due to the error in her self-awareness, she inevitably must distort external things.</p>
<p>"Her life is a succession of all illusions. First, an illusion about herself, then an illusion about others, followed by an illusion about places, and an illusion about time. These illusions, when viewed in detail, are all inevitable products of her illusions about herself. That is, the inevitable product of Bovarism."</p>
<p>This passage is an excellent annotation of Bovarism.</p>
<p>When we look at Madame Bovary's entire life, it is indeed a tragicomedy of illusions. She is dissatisfied with her ordinary husband, mistakes her ideal lover, indulges in religious ecstasy, and falls into carnal pleasures. But all of this gives her the suffering of disillusionment. The closer things get to her, the more her thoughts deviate from them. In such a continuous stream of illusions, she gradually consumes her life and finally embarks on the inevitable path of tragedy.</p>
<p>Some commentators believe that Bovarism like this is "a function that exists in all ages and environments among human beings." This conclusion still needs to be considered. Of course, we can say that Bovarism and the spirit of Ah Q in China have some similarities; however, due to the different environments, these two things are separated by significant differences. Even in the overall view, they are almost entirely different things. The similarity between them is that they both live in a world of "fantasy," however, Ah Q's "ideal" is the ideal of a slave; Madame Bovary's "ideal" is the ideal of a petty bourgeois.</p>
<p>Flaubert himself said, "Madame Bovary is me." This is not a joke. Flaubert extremely loathed the life of bourgeois society. In such a society, everything is ordinary, vulgar, greedy, and selfish. People are dragged down a despicable path by an invisible thread of money, and people are like puppets of money, everything develops "involuntarily." Although Flaubert said, "I did not infuse my feelings and life into this novel at all," this is incorrect. He himself contradicted himself, saying: "The artist in his work is just like God in creation. Although the eye cannot see, it cannot be without omnipotent power. His existence can be felt everywhere, but his form must not appear." Therefore, we have confidence to believe that Madame Bovary's soul is permeated with Flaubert's spirit. He uses this to judge his era's society and judge himself.</p>
<p>It is said that when Cervantes was on his deathbed, someone asked him who was written in "Don Quixote," and he replied, "It is me." This and Flaubert's statement "Madame Bovary is me" are of the same model. Flaubert's fondness for Cervantes, the reason for that should probably be sought in this principle. Isn't Don Quixote also disgusted with the vulgar world and filled with romantic passion and ideals? How similar is this to Madame Bovary!</p>
<p>Thus, we line up Don Quixote, Ah Q, and Madame Bovary, which is quite interesting. They are three "great" characters from different historical stages! There is a thread connecting them. But should such things really exist in "all ages and environments"? If we believe that history is made by mankind, then I can briefly answer: Absolutely not!</p>
<h3 id="e186">Song and Shooting <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Maxim Gorky</p>
<p>The midday sun in July burned fiercely in the brass-colored sky. The small town was dazed in the steamy heat, occasionally disturbed by vague and messy noises, but immediately fell silent and was buried in silence. A kind of affected, nasal voice mournfully dragged out this song:</p>
<p>(Across the silvery river,</p>
<p>Across the golden desert,</p>
<p>I am searching for a——</p>
<p>Young woman's trail…)</p>
<p>Another deep voice harshly asked:</p>
<p>"What did you do this morning?"</p>
<p>"I did some shooting."</p>
<p>"How many?"</p>
<p>"Three."</p>
<p>"Did they grumble?"</p>
<p>"Why would they grumble?"</p>
<p>"You mean they didn't make a sound?"</p>
<p>"They didn't make a sound at all. They're all stubborn and straightforward as usual… They're all trained, you know, and they believe that even if they suffer one day—the bill must be settled sooner or later."</p>
<p>"Are they important people?"</p>
<p>"No—at least I don't think so. They were messing around in those lousy places, so I guess they weren't important people."</p>
<p>There was silence for a while, and then the affected voice continued to sing mournfully:</p>
<p>(The bright moon,</p>
<p>Is my guide…)</p>
<p>"Did you shoot too?"</p>
<p>"Why wouldn't I?"</p>
<p>(Tell me,</p>
<p>Where she's hiding…)</p>
<p>The deep voice sneered:</p>
<p>"You, still singing about 'young women,' you still have to mend your own shirts, just like… you bastard!"</p>
<p>"Wait, the young woman will come in time. Everything will come…"</p>
<p>(Gentle wind,</p>
<p>Tell me,</p>
<p>What are her daydreams…)</p>

<h3 id="e187">Returning from Singapore <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Li Sanlang</p>
<p>Thrown into the dark and stuffy cabin, I looked back at the tall skyscrapers, the swaying coconut trees, as if they were seeing off a deported vagrant.</p>
<p>No friends saw me off, only the man with the gun escorted me onto the ship. Thus, I left Singapore.</p>
<p>After a seven-day voyage, I hid dizzily in the cabin, wanting to vomit and desperately thirsty, like someone who had been ill. I heard the mate's abuse, but I pretended not to hear it, and I dreamily thought of my motherland, how had that poor motherland evolved!</p>
<p>However, I was very afraid that if I contracted that detestable disease, I would be thrown into the boundless waves like a dead man, forcing me to suppress my pain at all times, not moaning like those young masters or mistresses—I want to see my motherland again!</p>
<p>One morning, on the motherland's sea surface, I could see the distant mountain peaks, gradually revealing the tiny foreign houses. Mountains, beaches, green outlines appeared in the morning glow beneath the green sea and the azure sky.</p>
<p>"But that's not the motherland yet, it's Hong Kong that has blocked our country's gateway!"</p>
<p>However, I love the verdant mountain peaks, and the beautiful shadows reappeared in my eyes. As the ship slowly sailed into the port, the clouds and mist raced across the green peaks. Two high mountains stood opposite each other in the narrow harbor, and the beautiful houses were neatly arranged, stacked high, one level after another, all the way to the unscattered snowy sky. -- Is this a city moved from Europe to China? Isn't the smoking beach filled with large and small steamships? Perhaps even more bustling than Shanghai! It's full of coolies, moving like hungry cats. The rows of skyscrapers of large banks, restaurants, and department stores are even more prosperous than Singapore.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath. What I saw was almost the same as in the southern islands, but there were no dense green trees, but eyes that were even more fierce than cats chasing mice, fixed on this body that had lost its freedom.</p>
<p>When the ship was about to reach the dock, an Indian devil who had been escorted from Singapore to Hong Kong handed me over to the inspectors here.</p>
<p>"I'm handing him over to you."</p>
<p>The fat, pig-like Chinese man pursed his long mouth, talking to the Englishman while scanning me from head to toe, looking at the official document, which wrote down my crimes! … They stared at me with cat-like eyes, searched my body, I didn't make a sound, gritting my teeth and glaring at the insignias on their collars.</p>
<p>All those actions made my heart beat faster and my chest boil. I wished I could burn away their leering faces.</p>
<p>Only when a small electric boat came to pick me up was I taken to a steamer going inland.</p>
<p>My unfree body hid in a dark corner again, quietly waiting for the treatment that my motherland would give me.</p>

<h3 id="e188">The Guangzhou Clothing Problem <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Government, the clothing system has still followed the old system of the Qing Dynasty. No reforms have been made to correct the foundation. In today's country, with force as the prerequisite, the reform of clothing is especially necessary. One is to display the color of civilization, and the other is to display the spirit of martial valor. In this world of the survival of the fittest, weak countries have no room for survival. The imperialists of the world have already clearly told us.</p>
<p>According to recent telegrams from Guangzhou, the police have been inspecting women's clothing in theaters and entertainment venues for days, to see if they meet the standards set by the authorities. Those who violate them are taken to the police station for punishment. According to the new rules, women's clothing must be below the knee and below the elbow, and their necks must be covered. However, the long sleeves rule has been allowed to be modified due to a petition from the Guangzhou Women's Association. The Guangzhou clothing problem has been discussed in this publication before, but there has only been general opposition, and no thorough research. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, men's long robes and mandarin jackets, or suits and leather shoes, have not changed at all, while women's clothing has been constantly changing, with dazzling and strange patterns, almost changing every day. It is not impossible to impose restrictions. However, it is ridiculous that Guangzhou standard clothing must be below the knee and below the elbow, and the neck must be covered. A woman's neck is the same as a man's neck, so what is so special about it that it must be covered? This is the first strange thing. Women's short sleeves not only display the beauty of the flesh, but also the issue of showing off, and the convenience of operation is also one of the reasons. What is the meaning of opposing short sleeves? This is the second strange thing. As for clothes below the knee, it is even more difficult to understand. Now, whether men or women, clothes should be convenient and economical. If a woman is chaste, below the knee is fine, and not below the knee is also fine. If a woman is not chaste, below the knee is not fine, and not below the knee is also not fine. Isn't it that below the knee is possible to do that, and not below the knee it is not possible to do that?</p>
<p>However, the system of short sleeves can be strictly prohibited in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and northern places, but Guangzhou does not have to. Why is this? The climate is different. The weather in the north is cold, and women in short sleeves often get so cold that their skin turns red and purple, and even develop frostbite, which is also harmful to health. Therefore, it can be prohibited in winter, but not prohibited in spring and summer. As for Guangzhou, the weather is warm all year round, so it is meaningless to strictly prohibit it. In short. In the current era, the clothing of men and women should tend to be convenient and be able to display the spirit of martial valor. If this principle is reversed and one focuses solely on enchanting and lewd appearances, or on ancient etiquette, it is all meaningless.</p>
<p>As for men's clothing, it has been discussed by many people in this publication in previous years. Generally speaking, it is advocated to remove long robes and mandarin jackets and create a kind of light and simple clothing. The general opinion is that it should be a Chinese-style jacket that is only knee-length, because long robes and mandarin jackets not only completely display a weak attitude, but also have a passive atmosphere in spirit, and are also extremely inconvenient for walking. As for suits and leather shoes, although they are more stylish, wearing them is also extremely cumbersome, and the people of a country have their own clothes, so why must they learn the fur of Westerners? Now the Guangzhou authorities intend to strictly prohibit students from wearing suits, which is not impossible, but only strictly prohibiting students from wearing suits, and not strictly prohibiting other people from wearing suits, what is the reason for this? It is really puzzling.</p>
<h3 id="e189">In the Fourth-Class Cabin <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Menghua</p>
<p>In this huge ocean liner, I used fifty-six dollars to exchange for this five-foot square space. The fourth-class cabin is always without sunlight, and in this hot June weather, the sea breeze outside is howling, but there is not a trace of wind here. Next to it is the engine room, which spreads unbearable heat to these lowly fourth-class passengers. The air is like a solidified piece of aluminum, and we are even deprived of the right to breathe.</p>
<p>After disembarking from Singapore, my head felt like someone was constantly pricking it with needles, dizzy and painful, and I couldn't even sleep. Under the mat, however, was a black, sticky steel plate, and centipedes crawled to the edge of my mat from time to time. When I crushed them to death, their stomachs full of dirty blood made me want to vomit.</p>
<p>I cursed money all the time, especially when I heard the low music from above. I imagined the noble gentlemen dancing slowly on the waxed, smooth floor, singing softly, and passing the June twilight on the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>But in this kind of cabin, some people are so happy. Over there, four people are playing mahjong, and nearby, five or seven people are opening a fan-tan game, and some people are playing cards. The yelling and scolding sometimes even drowned out the huge noise of the axles. They were naked, only wearing a bath towel, and on their backs, chests, and foreheads, sweat hung down like small streams, but they were concentrating, fighting against unknown gambling luck. In the hanging berth opposite, a middle-aged woman was accompanying a small oil lamp. The small red flame was covered by a pale white lampshade and looked even weaker. In this small cabin, which was no more than four square yards, deception, selfishness, obscenity, and decadent human nature overflowed along with the heat and fishy smell.</p>
<p>On the third day of the voyage, after checking the tickets, two more people were added to this small cabin, they were tied to an iron pillar. The woman's shirt was torn, and the man's back and legs had whip marks, and the dried bloodstains were like thick red lines, flowing down from his forehead, shoulders, chest, and calves. At first, they tried to struggle and cried miserably. After two or three hours, they were silent, burying their heads, as tired and weak as a traveler who had walked tens of thousands of miles.</p>
<p>"It will take half a month to get to Tangshan, and even if you steal it, you will starve to death." An old man said, "I have walked this waterway at least ten times, and no one has ever been able to steal it. Can you steal it? Alas, even your life is not worth it…" He sighed, as if immersed in terrible memories. From his words, I learned that they had secretly hidden in the cargo hold before the ship sailed. They had not slept, eaten, or drunk water, and they had secretly climbed up just on the day of the ticket inspection, so they were found.</p>
<p>"The captain was going to throw them into the sea, how dangerous!" The old man said and walked away.</p>
<p>I looked at the couple, they were like two boneless people, softly drooping their upper bodies.</p>
<p>Next to them, the people playing mahjong were still happy, yelling and scolding loudly, as if there were no two compatriots in distress behind them. I felt as if something powerful was pressing down on my heart, and I almost fainted.</p>
<p>"Uncle, you have to think of a way for them, how can they survive tonight like this? They haven't even had a drop of water."</p>
<p>At the cabin door, two Tangshan sailors stuck their heads in, as if searching for something. The four dim lights inside made it difficult for them to see what they were looking for, so one of them stepped into the cabin.</p>
<p>"Fellow villager, save them, they are almost dead." I said to those two bound people, my voice like a patient's.</p>
<p>The sailor waved to his companion at the cabin door, and then three people ran in, they walked over with big strides, desperately untying the big knot.</p>
<p>"You let them go, if the captain asks, it's none of our business." A thin-faced man said, wiping the sweat from his forehead. He was a hunchback.</p>
<p>"Damn you, what are you! Shameless, you are Chinese!" A sailor took a step forward, and before he could push him, he had already retreated three or four steps. He quietly retreated to that corner, trembling and sitting down, timidly watching the commotion.</p>
<p>In front of these two victims was a pile of white rice and pickles, and also a peeled pineapple. People looked at them with pity. The woman lowered her head, staring blankly at the rice bowl, and couldn't swallow a mouthful of rice for a long time. Her shoulders twitched violently, and tears of gratitude flowed from her deeply sunken eye sockets like broken beads.</p>
<p>That night, I began to close my tired eyelids, but I suddenly woke up in the middle of the night. The sound of the sea waves outside was roaring. I listened to the sound of the water until dawn, and I didn't close my eyes again.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Loquat <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Lishi</p>
<p>The weather is getting hot, which reminds me that it's the season for loquats to be on the market in my hometown. This unique southern fruit is something to be nostalgic for; especially since my aunt's house has an orchard.</p>
<p>It was a very large vegetable garden. Every time I went to my aunt's house, my cousin would take me inside to see if any fruits were ripe. Among the pomelos, longans, lychees, and various other fruits, I liked loquats the most. And there were especially many loquat trees in that orchard. Walking in through the fence at the garden entrance, seeing the trees full of loquats, I would get very excited, tugging at my cousin's hand and shouting, "The loquats are ripe! The loquats are ripe!" incessantly. Then, I would climb the tree, my cousin would hold the basket below, and a large bunch of loquats would fill the basket. Thinking I could eat my fill, I would happily shout from the tree, making my cousin urge me from below; at the same time, she was afraid I might fall down if I wasn't careful.</p>
<p>Bringing the loquats into the courtyard, after dinner, with the cool breeze blowing, we, four or five people, would sit around in a circle, and start eating and talking. My aunt was a woman good at talking, and she and my mother seemed to have endless things to say, often talking until we wanted to sleep. Once, sitting beside them, I heard my aunt say that her family's situation was getting worse year by year, and since my uncle passed away, they had gradually borrowed a lot of money, and the orchard was mortgaged. Naturally, if things continued like this, one day the orchard would become someone else's; then I would no longer have the happiness of climbing the loquat trees.</p>
<p>There was also a time when I got sick from eating too many loquats. My aunt looked at me from afar, comforting me with a gentle expression, and also said that there were still a lot of loquats, and as long as I got well, I could go to her place. I lay in bed, responding with a grateful smile. I wanted to ask her why my cousin hadn't come, but in the end, I couldn't bring myself to say it.</p>
<p>As soon as I got better, I went to my aunt's house again. My mother kept telling me not to be too greedy, and I nodded in agreement. This time, I was really a little afraid of getting sick again, so I just played with my cousin in the orchard. We lingered, reluctant to leave, until dusk arrived.</p>
<p>During this time, I left my hometown once, which was exactly the season when the loquat trees were full of fruit. My aunt gave me a large basket, and even after eating them all the way to where I was going, there were still many left. So I took them as gifts for the people there. They also loved loquats, so they were very happy; and they listened to me tell stories about loquats. Such days passed quickly, and it was late autumn when I returned to my hometown.</p>
<p>A cool breeze blew on me, and the gray clouds in the sky looked very dim. I stayed at home for one night, and the next morning I went to see my aunt and cousin. When I got there, the atmosphere was a little different. Although my aunt greeted me with a smile, her face seemed to have some worries, which she couldn't hide no matter what. My cousin's expression was very melancholy, and she kept her head down, not saying a word. I asked her to go to the orchard with me; she seemed a little embarrassed, but she didn't refuse me. So, we pushed open the fence, and the afternoon sunlight shone through the gaps in the leaves onto the soil, spreading over it like patterns. The late autumn wind blew the leaves, rustling. Yellow leaves were withering, falling down; the scene in the orchard looked very sad.</p>
<p>Yes, later I learned that the orchard had changed hands and was no longer my aunt's. The sorrow of a declining family was something I didn't yet feel personally: I only felt that when the loquat season came the following year, there would be no more basket after basket of loquats to eat.</p>
<p>Everything in my hometown is unbearable to recall. What is the situation now? What I cannot forget are the abundant orchard, the ripe loquats, and the faces of my aunt's family...</p>
<h3 id="e191">Cat <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>The lights are off, and you can see the moon hanging in the corner of the sky outside the window, round and bright, like a naive girl standing far away with shy charm, secretly watching the people inside the window. On such a gentle and beautiful midnight, one should be able to sleep peacefully. Many beautiful dreams are waiting for me. Just as I thought of this, I heard the cat's meow: I know this is the white cat I often see on the wall outside the window, maybe it encountered some disappointing things somewhere and jumped to the top of the wall to lament its fate. This situation has long aroused my concern. I thought to myself that this cat must have its own unutterable misfortune; because on the roof tiles nearby, there are other cats making romantic affairs that disturb people's dreams at night, which can be distinguished from their passionate meows. But this cat doesn't seem to care much about what its kind is doing, it always drags its disappointed tail, quietly walks over, and quietly walks away, lonely patrolling the night, doing nothing to contend with the world, nothing to do with the world? This little place on the top of the wall seems to be its only resting place. Lonely cat.</p>
<p>, it is meowing so lonely again, it sounds like it's right at my upstairs window. I think it may know that within this wide-open upstairs window, there is me, still awake in the middle of the night, hearing its meow and caring about everything about it. I believe it has already recognized me, because I have seen it jump onto the wall from somewhere several times during the day; when it encounters me leaning against the window, it will raise its round head, open its sad eyes, and exchange a few glances with me. Its expression seems to be full of suspicion about everything, and very indifferent, it treats me the same way, without fear, and without showing any intention of asking for intimacy. It comes, squats on the top of the wall, raises its foot to wash its face, looks at the sparrows jumping and wagging their tails on the corner of the building, spacing out for a moment; sometimes a burst of cooing pigeon bells suddenly flies through the sky, or a black shadow of some bird flashes past it, and it twitches its two ears, stares blankly at the sky, at this time, its expression also becomes more lively. Its eyes will also meet my eyes that are watching it, and suddenly, it seems like we have touched a tacit understanding of friendship, , the sound is sent up so light and peaceful, and I inexplicably feel a kind of joy in my heart.</p>
<p>Whose cat is it? I often ask myself this question. Looking at its expression, it looks very much like an abandoned cat with no home to rely on, but even if it has a home, its owner must not treat it with much care and love. If my speculation is correct, then the things it suffers from being bullied by others in its life will be unavoidable. The cold looks between its kind, the bullying of dogs, the ruthless broom in the hands of the maid, and even the evil deeds of wild children, these unfortunate blows will become encounters that will not be lacking in daily life. Besides being exhausted from running around to deal with these headaches and spending its days, there is only a little short time left, but it is a human loneliness that cannot be expressed after thinking about it. Is the top of this small wall its resting and playing place? No! It is ultimately a frustrated cat. The distance between humans and animals is so great, even if I care about it, I can't use my words to eliminate this separation, let alone give it affection and love.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, I put on my clothes, and I naturally saw it, its lonely appearance more obvious in the faint moonlight. Maybe it was an unexpected joy, , it meowed so softly again, what words can I use to ask it back? This poor cat. So I thought of the talking cat in fairy tales, if it could speak human language, or if I could speak cat language, not only could I express the sympathy in my heart, comfort it, and encourage it. In this sleepless midnight, could we not pour out the private thoughts stored in our chests? Human beings also have a feeling of loneliness in life.</p>

<p>(4) Dance Halls</p>
<p>This is a very regrettable thing. I don't know how to dance, and I haven't learned it, and I haven't even been to a dance hall for sightseeing. However, I have noticed that dance halls in Tokyo are very prosperous, especially in the bustling areas of Shinjuku, Ginza, and Asakusa, there are many magnificent dance halls. Those dance halls that specialize in the business of Chinese students seem to be doing very well. "Studying in Japan News" once published a shocking statistic that the amount of money spent by students there is about tens of thousands of yuan per month. This needless to say is a kind of consumption of the sons of bureaucrats and the playboys among the students.</p>
<p>When I was studying Japanese at a certain cram school, a certain gentleman in the front row of me was the best at dancing. He said that he spent almost one or two yuan every night. He was the son of a capitalist. He had "studied" in France for more than two years. Because he spent too much money, his father wanted him to transfer to Japan. Fortunately, the cost of living in Japan was not high, and dancing was much cheaper than in Shanghai. It seemed that one yuan could buy more than one and a half times the tickets in Shanghai, so he lived a very comfortable life. When he was in class, you could just call him and he could take out ten bills. But I don't know why, at that time I didn't have the slightest interest in dancing, and I couldn't even raise my head to "sightsee".</p>
<p>Last year, Japanese newspapers published that the authorities had issued an order strictly prohibiting students from entering dance halls and cafes, but the conditions were so favorable, only prohibiting them from entering in uniform. Poor students only have one or two sets of uniforms, but for rich students, isn't it good to wear their various beautiful Western suits?</p>
<p>Dance girls and cafe girls were afraid that their lives would suffer a miserable fate, so each sent representatives to negotiate with the authorities. I don't know what the result was. But soon, the doors of the cafes were posted with signs inviting students to patronize. Needless to say, the dance halls were the same, like a river. Then this official formality is a waste of energy and effort. However, this is to decorate "morality" and "etiquette". This decoration does no harm to itself, and does not cause any damage to our Chinese students. One party uses such decoration to shake the face of dignity without affecting the consumption of some of the students, and the other party's students are still not prevented from seeking entertainment, isn't that getting the best of both worlds?</p>

<p>— Bai Mu</p>
<p>Skinny Monkey Han Langen plays a very gluttonous and timid idiot in the upcoming Yi Hua new film "Avatar Girl". One day, because he wanted to buy some cosmetics to win the favor of his beloved girlfriend, he gritted his teeth and asked his father for four mao. However, his father was very serious, and as a result, he got a scolding instead. He backed out and wandered in the yard for a long time, and then he changed his mind and walked to his cousin Yuan Meiyun's room. At this time, Yuan Meiyun was leaning on the sofa reading a book called "Women's Physiology and Hygiene". Seeing him walking in in a panic, she couldn't help but blush and turn red, and her embarrassment was more pitiful than the state of Skinny Monkey being condemned in front of his father. However, Skinny Monkey did not pay attention to the book Yuan Meiyun was reading. At first, he was like a flirting daughter, embarrassed for a long time, and finally spent a lot of effort to ask her for money. Yuan Meiyun hesitated and asked him how much he wanted, and he bent four fingers to mean borrowing four mao, but Yuan Meiyun lent him four yuan. This time, Skinny Monkey was overjoyed. So, in a little while, he had already bought a lot of cosmetics such as snow cream and white powder from the street and returned.</p>
<p>Although this is a small episode in "Avatar Girl", Skinny Monkey's ever-changing and embarrassing face, and Yuan Meiyun's embarrassment when he bumped into her reading "Women's Physiology and Hygiene", are enough to make people laugh until their eyes are watery.</p>

<p>The whistle blows repeatedly, the sound of the machine vibrates, rattling non-stop, the sound of water gradually rises and fades, and the greetings of passengers can be heard slightly. The whistle, the machine, and the sound of water gradually decrease, and the sound of people gradually increases, indicating that they are entering the cabin from outside the ship.</p>

<p>The "Escape from Boad Island", which is currently being shown at the Shanghai Grand Theater, depicts the inhumane facts of the "Devil's Island" prison, a French prison specially designed for imprisoning the most terrifying international criminals. The tension of the plot makes it impossible to breathe, and every scene grips the psychology of the audience, which can be called a masterpiece. The film was previously censored by the concession inspection office by one-third, which shows the seriousness of its content. It is now being shown in the theater and has not been cut by an inch. Viewers, please do not miss the opportunity. This film is indeed a masterpiece worth watching.</p>

<p>Lianhua's filming, shooting the eldest son's family scene of "Song of the Loving Mother".</p>
<p>The eldest son, Hong Jingling, and the eldest daughter-in-law, Li Zhuozhuo, Hong Jingling is not a good person in the film; although Li Zhuozhuo does not always play the villain, the fierce daughter-in-law she plays in "The Family" is no different in this "Song of the Loving Mother".</p>
<p>With such a son and such a daughter-in-law, the pain of a mother in the family can be imagined.</p>
<p>The mother is played by Lin Chuchu. On this day, what they were filming was the son and daughter-in-law indirectly forcing the mother to leave. Although this was acting, Lin Chuchu's tears were really forced out by them.</p>

<p>Within these three days, there will be an amazing performance on the Shanghai theater stage. The extent of this amazement is reaching an unexpected level. However, the matter can only be decided at 12:00 noon today. If there is no problem, we can tell the readers this good news tomorrow.</p>

<p>Movie actors who are loyal to their work often make great sacrifices, and these sacrifices sometimes even endanger their lives. In addition to actors, the sacrifices of various creatures are of course also many.</p>
<p>We remember that a few years ago, when "A Cut Plum Blossom" was made, a horse was beaten to death alive. Two months ago, when filming "The Lost Lamb", a dog and more than twenty birds also died. Recently, in "Go to Nature", a fawn was killed.</p>
<p>Horses and deer can of course be bought with money, but if it weren't for filming, they wouldn't have sacrificed their lives.</p>
