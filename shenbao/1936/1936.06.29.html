<p>夫社會之演進往往有兩派力量交相作用有時調和有時衝突一種為維持現狀之力量亦卽惰性一種為打破現狀之力量亦卽離心力承平之世繁榮時代維持現狀之力最强及經濟界之不景氣到來社會不安打破現狀派乃得抬頭美國情形在經濟界之主張維持現狀者華爾街之金融家也東部大都邑之產業家國際商人也在政治界之主張維持現狀者共和黨實為中心團體極端者者如三K黨如軍人同志會等在社會上之主張維持現狀者上層階級有產階級愛國主義者民主主義者自由主義者也彼等怯於試騐懶於冒險戀舊日之光榮駭危言與新制而本屆共和黨之政綱及候選總統之人選實充份帶有此種色彩</p>
<p>革新勢力在美國社會頗不易滋長微經濟之大恐慌前屆競選中民主黨之得勢蓋不可能近者經濟情形漸漸好轉產業活動漸接近一九二九年之高峰都市之中漸見烟突吐氣機輪飛轉而人民動久思靜變久思常共和黨之漸獲民心非無故也雖然美國之產業界雖已欣欣向榮然資本制度之病象反日加重失業問題無法解决據可靠估計現在美國有工作能力而不能為產業界容納者尙有一千餘萬人且農村都市兩不平衡政府負債如山預算不得均衡凡此種種均不許樂觀過早使共和黨一旦掌政必使胡佛時代之悲劇重演而一度反動則改革之勢力一度加强改革無效革命繼之故為蚤部美國計算亦惟有使民主黨繼續持政四年為較有利而無危險性也</p>

<h3>藝術漫談　「禁止攀折」（下）</h3>
<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>然而我們也不可不為公園的管理人着想。上述的遊客，原是盡規踏矩而以謙恭為懷的好人。倘使他不吸香烟，而身上的紐扣又個個扣好，眞可謂新生活運動中的完人了。但是世間像這樣的人並不多。公園的遊客中，有許多人要攀花折柳，有許多人要殃及池魚，有許多人耍踐踏草地，還有許多人要無心或有心地毀壞公園中的設備。公園中倘不掛這些殺風景的「禁止」，恐怕早已不成為公園而變成廢墟了。而且，「禁止」的警吿能够發生效力，還只限於稍稍文明的地方。有許多公共的風景地方，不聲不響的「禁止」兩個字全然無效。前會親眼看見穿着體面的長衫而在「禁止攀折」的標札旁邊攀折重瓣桃花的人。又會親眼看見安閒地坐在「禁止洗滌」的牌子下面洗滌袴子的人。又會屢屢看見悠然地站在「禁止小便」的大字下面放小便的人。對於這種人，卽使一連掛了十張「禁止」的標札，也無效用；卽使把「禁止」兩字寫得同「醬園」或「當」一樣大，也不相干。對於這種人，看來只有每處派個武裝警察，一天到晚站崗，時時肆行叱罵，必要時還得飛送耳光，方始有效。這樣看來，那些公園能以「禁止」二字收得實效，可謂文明地方的現象；而懸掛「禁止」的標札，也可說是很文明的辦法。我們在這裏埋怨這種辦法的殺風景，似乎對於公園的管理者太不原諒，而對於人世太奢望了。</p>
<p>理想往往與事實相左，然而不能因此而廢棄理想。和平美麗的公國中處處懸掛「禁止」的標札，到底是一件使人不快的事。世人慣說「藝術能美化人生，」我在這裹想起了一個適切的實例：據某畫家說，某處的公園中的標札，用漫書來代替文字，用要求同情來代替禁北，可謂調劑理想與事實的巧妙的辦法。例如要警吿遊人勿攀花木，用不着模仿軍政法政，板起臉孔來喊「禁止。」不妨描一張美麗的漫畫，畫中表示一雙手正在攀折一朶花，而花心裏伸出一個人頭來，向着觀者顰蹙哀號，痛哭流涕。這不但比「禁止」好看，據我想來實比禁止有效得多。花木雖然不能言語，但牠們的具有生機，人類可以遷想而知。有一種花被折斷了創口中立刻流一種白色的滋水來，葉兒立刻軟疲下來。看了這光景，誰也覺得悽慘。因為這種滋水可以使聯想到血，這種葉兒可以使人聯想到肢體。那幅漫盡所表出的，便是這種悽慘的光景。向人的內心裹要求同情，自此强橫的禁止有效得多。又如要警吿遊人勿傷害池魚，也可用同樣的方法，來要求同情畫一個大魚，頭上包着紗布，身上貼着好幾處十字形的絆創膏，張着口，流着淚，好像在那裹呌痛旁邊不妨再畫幾條小魚，偎傍在大魚身旁，或者流着同情之淚，或在用嘴吻他的創口。這是一幅很可動人的漫畫。把人類的事（絆創膏）借用在魚類身上，一方面非常滑稽可笑，另一方而非常易以引起同情。又如要警吿遊人勿踏草地，也可畫一隻天皮鞋，沈重地踏在許多小草上。每枝小草身上者長着一個小頭，形似一羣幼稚園裏的小孩。但這些頭都被大皮鞋所踏匾，成荸薺形，大家匾着嘴在那裹哭。人們對於脚底下的事，最不易注意。但倘把臉貼伏在地上，細細觀察走路時脚底下所起的情形，實在是很可驚的。那皮鞋好像飛來峯，許多小虫被牠突然壓死，許多小草被牠突然腰斬。腰斬的傷痕療養到將要復原的時候，又一個飛來峯突然壓潰了牠。這是何等動人的現象！這幅畫就把這種現象放大，促人注意。看了這畫之後，把脚踏到靑靑的嫩草上去，脚底下似覺癢癢的非常不安。這便是那幅畫的效果。</p>
<p>這種畫的效果，乃由於前述的自然「有情化」而來。能把花木，池魚，小草推想做和人一樣有感情的活物，看了這些畫方有戚動。而「有情化」的看法，又根據在人性中的「同情心」上。要先能推己及人，然後能遷想於物，而開「有情化」之眼。故上述的漫盡標札，對於缺乏同情心的人，還是無效。為了有這些人，多數具足人性的好人無辜地在公園裏吃着那種嚴厲的警吿。　二十五年五月三十一日</p>

<h3>生活科講演之二　今後怎樣研究生物學（下）</h3>
<p>— 薛德焴</p>
<p>生物學和其他科學不同，帶有地方性，兼以我國地大物博，生產豐富，生物種類，至今猶未調查淸楚，加能從各方面研究，發見新種新事實的機會，較其他科學為多；所以純正生物學亦未可忽視。再者一月份海關發表的對外貿易統計，入口貨主為棉及棉織品，毛及毛織品，洋米，小麥，魚介海產品，木材，紙張等：出口貨主為桐油，猪鬃豆類，糠麩，芝蔴，茶，絲，菸葉，蛋反蛋產品，生熟皮反皮貨，棉子油等；並且出超有九百萬元。我們受這種報告的刺激，在過去不屑研究應用，祇講理論的生物學者，亦有相當之覺悟。這樣看來，純正生物學與應用生物學，在我國應相輔而行，不可偏廢。</p>
<p>研究能力的養成從前敎授生物學的方法，大槪注重於理解，記憶和原理原則的應用，我以炒這是先生希望學生考試成績好看的一種敎法，絕不能藉此判斷學生的研究能力，今後敎授生物學，要養成對於研究新的村料共實在的研究能力。所謂研究能力，非一言所能盡，大槪包含下列幾點：</p>
<p>一，研究題目的發見力……疑問</p>
<p>二，研究要點的着眼力……假定</p>
<p>三，解宜方法的設計力……計劃</p>
<p>（A）蒐藥材料力　（B）觀察實騐力　（C）區別比較力　（D）推理力　（E）歸納力｝……實施</p>
<p>四，研究結果的總括力和發表力……批判上列疑問，假定，計劃，實施批判等，我以為是訓練研究時最重要的目標，對於這種能力，就可以稱之為研究能力。</p>
<p>從前在學校裏面研究生物的方法是「先生教」「學生信」，標本，儀器，實騐，僅補先生言語的不足，證明學生所敎的不差，所有的答問，僅借學生的口回答先生所預定的事項罷了。這種研究物態度，永遠不能養成學生有獨創的研究能力。因為研究要從疑問入手，瓦特Watt發明蒸汽機，牛頓t。。發明地球引力，就是能疑常人之所不疑。原來人類本有兩種天性，一種是「多疑」，一種是「偏信」，如小兒初聽到雷聲，倘告以「雷公會打人」，以後聞雷聲，就怕雷公來打他；如告以「雷是兩電相觸而發的聲」，他對於雷，就不害伯。故指導研究者需分別淸楚，應使其疑者疑，應使其信者信，萬一應疑的地方而加以壓迫，則司疑的神經中樞便退化，將釆就養成一般盲從家」「迷信家」，學問方面就無發展希望。因為要希望一種學問發展，專賴有獨創的研究要有獨創的研究，平素須養成有獨創的研究能力。</p>
<p>研究的動機在疑問，並且要着重在What「How　Why？　For　What？」四字。</p>
<p>What？　What「這是什麼」的疑問，在生物學方面是屬於有分類性質的疑問。例如樹」和「昆蟲」說：「這是什麼樹」？「這是什麼蟲」？是含有要求明瞭分類的意義。</p>
<p>How？　How「怎樣」的疑問，在生物學方面是屬於有形態學（解剖學）性質的疑問。例如「進種樹的花是怎樣的」？「這個蟲裏面的構造是怎樣的」？是含有要求明瞭他的形態和構造的意義。</p>
<p>Why　Why「什麼緣故」的疑問，在生物學方面是屬於有生理作用的疑問例如樹葉變紅什麼緣故」？「蜘蟟能嗚什麼緣故」？是含有要求明瞭他的生理作用的意義。</p>
<p>For　What？For　Whet「為什麼」的疑問，在生物學方面是屬於有生態性質的疑問。例如「樹葉變紅又為什麼目的」？這是含有要求明瞭他的生態的意義。</p>
<p>有了上面四個字的疑問，就可以研究分類學，形態學，生理學，生態學。我再舉一個實際的例來證明，譬如你看見「蜜蜂」在花間飛翔發生了疑問，要想就道個疑問去研究，怎樣地着手去研究呢？先要假定蜜峰在花間飛翔，和花必有某種的關係，伸到花間去採集蜜鋒和花，加以觀察；觀蔡之不縠，再加以實驗，將所得的事實，互相比較和推測，於是再歸納起來，斷定蜜蜂在花間飛翔，是吸花間的蜜，間接並能媒介花粉。這種結論，可算是一種新的發見，不妨發表出來請大家批評。</p>
<p>結論　和人生的關係最密切而又帶有地方性的生物學，今後的研究，要注意養成對物研究新的材料有實在的研究能力。具有這種能力以後，纔有新的發明，發見和特殊的貢獻；固時對於理論和應用，要雙方並進，不可偏廢。（完）</p>

<h3>南通區專員葛覃　視察蘇北鹽墾報告</h3>
<p>並述開發墾區意見</p>
<p>南通通信、通信區專員葛覃、視察江北鹽墾區返通、特呈報江蘇省政府云、　專員奉命督治南通區以來、即注意於社會經濟之考察、及如何推進問題、以本區產棉最富、紡織工業、亦甚發達、故確認關於棉業之改進發展、最關切要、經數月之研討、以爲發展棉業、必須作大規模之墾殖、以統制方式、從事於開發水利、改良土壤、防止蟲害、經營生產、與運銷諸項工作、第此等工作、首需鉅　、年來本區各種事業不振、集　不易、即本省財力、亦難悉數接濟、故銀行投　、實爲唯一途徑、次需專門技術、舉凡水利土壤蟲害　種產銷諸問題、均有待於專家之研究與貢獻、專員爲求計劃之實現、迭經與上海實業界金融界、往復磋商、咸表贊同、經決定聯合上海各大銀行、各事業公司、棉業統制委員會等、並邀請各種專家、組織鹽墾經濟視察團、實地視察、以作開發之參考與準備、茲將視察經過·感想、並赴陳意見、分節　呈如左、</p>
<p>視察經過</p>
<p>視察團共計四十二人、計有省政府、棉業統制委員會代表、上海各銀行代表、各墾殖公司代表、南通學園農科教授、及技術家商業家等、於六月十一日、集齊南通、次日參觀南通學園農科·紡織科·大生紗廠·及電廠等處、十三日經如皋海安而抵東台、倉管大豐鹽墾公司墾區、全國經濟委員會、所築之下明閘、海門龍港、抵鹽城縣境、參觀泰和鹽墾公司墾區、十四日參觀中央棉產改進所之東台植棉指導所、及江蘇省政府建設廳所築之王港水閘、繼至裕華墾·殖公司墾區、及商記墾團墾區參觀、十五日抵阜甯縣境、參觀華成鹽墾公司墾區、十六日參觀南通學院大學基產處墾區及中央棉產改　所　阜植棉指導所、合德墾殖公司、大綱墾　公司、十八日返南通、十九日藏大有晉鹽墾公司、大豫鹽墾公司、視察團同人、均能各就專長、切實研究、　暑跋涉、始終不懈、精神至佳也、</p>
<p>所得感想</p>
<p>茲就視察所得、感想所及、　要　陳如左、墾區各公司、負責人均勇於服務、經過多年之失敗、精神毫不稍屈、　能於　植專業、更得深切之認識、穩慎　　、　海斥　之地、已逐漸開闢、生產棉花、本地與外地農民、亦多勞來安　、從事新種、各區地價與佃租較前增高、政府當局、亦復注意於此、浚河築閘、不遺餘力、本省開浚新運河之　　、　着手測量、不日興工、在各方一致促進墾植專業現象之下、前途希望殊覺無限者也、</p>
<p>疏浚水利</p>
<p>水利在墾殖事業上、佔最重地位、農田灌溉、實繫於此、於排水引水之外、欲達蓄水換水目的、首應造閘、下明閘王港竹港兩閘、先後落成、各區河溝漸次開浚、　堪欣幸、惟造閘以後、尚須隨時浚治、注意啟閉、新陽港射陽河港墾地極多、尤應早日建閘、以資節宣、他日新運河開浚以後、東西與南北支河、尚須多多開浚、以利灌溉、</p>
<p>改進土壤</p>
<p>濱海墾區、昔多煎鹽灶地、斥　百里、種植爲難、尤荒地而闢爲熟田、頗需時日、改良土性、爲鹽墾區重要工作、果能運以資金、加以人力、則不毛之地、何難變爲沃土、萬一不加改良、一任自然、則瀘氣上昇、紅蒿遍地可耕之土、重返爲不治之田、可見　草蓄淡種青地下排水諸工程、決不可少、而農人資力、更須設法扶植、此爲墾區生命綫之所在、不容忍忽視者也、</p>
<p>防治蟲害</p>
<p>棉田大敵、厥爲害蟲、墾區蟲害、較其他農田爲烈、蓋全區作物、大率僅有棉花一種、土壤未盡改善、不能實行輪作、以故蟲類滋生極速、撲滅較難、所經各區農民、均言在萌芽時期、被食於小地老虎、或成熟時期、被食於金剛鑽　葉蟲居多、是應預爲注意、加以防治、土壤經蓄淡地下排水以後、可以實行輪作、以除蟲害、並可利用藥物、隨時撲滅、果能防治得力、不但可以弭災、且可使產量大增、</p>
<p>改良棉種</p>
<p>墾區棉種、經多年之研究、採用金子棉之區域日廣、試植成績亦佳、　得農民信用、唯此項工作、最占重要、非與研究機關、切實合作、不易收效、今後應注意者、　繼續試驗、更適宜之良種以資推進、　注意育種、在全部墾植區以土質與氣候之關係、　隔三年至五年、應還種一次、全區需要五萬畝之育種場、用以供給全區棉種、　保持純種、應採用棉子統墾制辦法、取締農民花商自由軋花、由政府統制機關、就墾區內、設立軋花打包廠、就軋棉子、加以選擇、留純去劣、除劣種售與油廠外、純種發給農民播種、</p>
<p>研究栽培</p>
<p>墾區每畝籽花、產量在民國二十四年度內、最低不足二十斤、最高有一百五十斤、相差之遠如是、即在能否注意栽培而已、農民之所以不能積極栽培、多數困於經濟力量、是應由政府機關或金融團體、領導農民、組織合作社、酌量予以生產貸　、以補其經濟之不足、至於栽培技術上之改進、則有研究機關、予以指導、自能收相當效果、達到標準產量也、</p>
<p>保護治安</p>
<p>墾區保衛事宜、各區均有事業保安隊、常駐區內、担任治安、惟國民十九·二十兩年、海匪登陸盤踞　月以上、農民飽受搶　、眾產蕩然、整區損失不　、目下各公司、原有事業保安隊、保衛力量、尚嫌單薄、加以交通不便、往返需時、區域　　、呼應不　、爲農民安居樂業計、應用行政機關集中力量、統　籌畫、以策墾區之安全、</p>
<p>普及教育</p>
<p>墾區各公司、多已設立小學、惟農戶散居各地、農家子弟、就學有在十餘里外者、往返不便、不免視求學爲畏途區內農民識字者、尤佔少數、大豐公司、除設立農墾訓練班、訓練實地從事墾　人才、以外又與省廳合作、辦理師資訓練班、以爲普及教育之準備、用意甚是、今後墾區義務教育、與農民補習教育、應同等注意、各區應增設小學、逐漸推廣、以達強迫教育之目的、同時對於失學成人、應施以補習教育、與識字教育、利用通俗演講、提倡正當娛樂、並矯正農民不良習慣、導引農民正確思想、此爲墾區改進農民生活之基本工作、亦不容忽視者也、</p>
<p>救濟佃戶</p>
<p>墾區內如大豐合德各區、有一萬　以上之佃戶甚多、而借貸典質、赤貧如洗者、亦復不少、此後欲免佃戶困苦、或窮極萊租、以及種種業佃間糾紛事項、應由合作社充分補助佃戶之經濟力量研究機關、知道佃戶以耕種技術、使農民之生產增進、收入豐富、業佃雙方、交受其益、尤宜斟酌土地之公允價值、將區內土地、售給農民、分期繳價、使佃戶安心樂業、終年　勞耕種、不失其希望心、以達總理耕者有其田之目的、</p>
<p>補助貧農</p>
<p>墾區農民之經濟狀況、就視察所得、不堪平允、大率經濟力量、較足之農民、土質培養適宜、收穫較爲豐富、耕者畝數既多、獲利自巨、而儲蓄亦多、區內農民、以海門啟動兩縣人民居多、勇有開闢能力、進取精神、每有積蓄、　另向他處開發生地、獲利者有之、失敗者亦有之、惟居住無定、廣田自荒、應加制裁、至一般小農貧農、既不能多種地畝、更無培養地利能力、產量既少、食指尤繁、困苦之況、極爲可憫、應由政府以合作方式、指導富農、養成儲蓄習慣、幫助貧農、以耕種資本、農民經濟、倘日就改善、墾區事業、更易着手也、</p>
<p>開發意見</p>
<p>根據同人視察經過、及感想所得、認爲墾區事業、極有希望、惟過去行政機關、甚少監督指導與聯絡、既乏推動力量、自難收統制之成效、爲集中人力與財力、以促進墾區事業起見、應與墾區內、設一專門機關、直轄省府、賦以權利、以謀墾區內事業之統制、此次視察團同人、認目前亟須組設者有三、組織　設立淮南墾殖管理委員會、　設立江北墾殖區棉產改進處、　設立墾殖區建設貸　銀團、此外墾區內之交通事業、亟須改進者有二、　公路應在新運河施工之前、趕速完成、　電話、應從速裝設、以利消息、</p>
<p>此次本團同人、以短時間之視察、且未周歷全區、遺漏之處、在所難免、然其重要處、均已窺其門徑、加以各團員、均能聚精會神、純用客觀態度、研討各項問題、故所得結果、尚稱完滿、至以上所陳僅　　大者、將來仍須詳編報告、擬訂計劃、另行呈報、核定施行、倘荷察納、得以按步實現、則匪特墾區之幸已也、</p>

<h3>近人語録</h3>
<p>— 丘八</p>
<p>如要高呼做人，惟有怎樣的做我，所謂做人范　很大，也無非是要做一個好人，因為，人是跳不出社會的血脈的，所以我們所需要改造的，修養的，就是什麼呌做我，那末就得怎樣的做我。（董任堅先生說）</p>
<p>要解救青年的悲觀問題，先得明瞭其悲觀的成份，最均實的辦法，務須使一般青年要身體康健，生活安定，環境優美。（江問漁先生說）</p>
<h3>書章太炎先生</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>餘杭章氏太炎先生，時稱樸學大師。日前病歿於蘇之里第，赴音所傳，莫不為之恫悼，蓋先生以經師而為人師，自清季以訖今茲，為海內士林所崇仰有若泰斗，舍先生無有抗衡焉　茲略述其生前佚事，為恒人所未知者筆之，以諗閱者，有所資也。</p>
<p>先生成童後，卽隸德清俞曲園太史門下究心經史之學，人謂其提考籃戴銅頂，實未嘗一應博士弟子試也；故先生自少至壯，值鼎革之際，輒以排滿為揭　，有叩其所志者，曰，『吾至今猶是漢族齊民，非若數踏槐黃，鄉試中式者比，又烏得不爾也。』故定海黃以周，瑞安孫仲容，皆相與上下其議論，奮筆所至，隱以光復故物相號召，先生諱『絳，』字曰『太炎，』猶崑山顧亭林之懷抱，僅以『樸學』兩字崇之，豈知先生之心，風雨鷄鳴，固在彼不在此哉？</p>
<p>當庚子歲，（清光緒二十六年）創『蘇報』於福州路惠福里，先生為編撰之一人，或不知其命名之義，時上海之大報：曰，『滬』曰，『申』就其地以名之也，曰，『新聞』曰，『中外』質言其所取裁也，報而曰『蘇』所言不第蘇事，而館之所在地，又去蘇且數百里外，舉以詢之先生，先生笑曰，『蘇』證之說文，桂荏也，桂之性辣，而味辛，有良藥古口之義焉，又息也，有隱於報而暫息之義焉，然猶不足以盡吾報之意，易不云乎，震蘇蘇，蓋奮乎地下，驚乎百里，以發萬物，以起羣蟄，象取乎雷，音葉乎甦，緣是大聲疾呼，煩言苦口以震動而蘇醒之。昔曾惠敏有言，中國先睡後醒之巨物，吾欲以尺一之紙，代三寸之舌，以蘇四萬萬人之迷夢先生當日載筆，以與閱者相見，此物此志爾；不謂未幾，以序鄒容『革命軍』一書，而竟入獄，有謂先生為『昌言報』及『時務報』撰文，實誤，蓋其時『昌言』為汪穰卿『時務』為梁卓如所主，與先生之　趣廻異，必不肯以片紙投之也。</p>
<p>先生執東南文壇之牛耳，近以金　為稷門，號稱祭酒，而不知在四十年前，北地拳亂甫平，士風一變，以維新相標榜者滿海上，先生英年煥發，時登酒樓，恒與張繼鄒慰丹（卽容，四　巴縣人，年才十七）章士劍同飲，一夕，至半酣，大言曰，『吾輩四人當崛起，有事於中原以圖大業，』三人和之，自是遂為盟兄弟；不意未及三月，而慰丹以庚斃聞，先生亦遂不免，幽於西獄者將三稔，日以佛乘消遣鐵窗之况味耳。今行嚴雖以律務自執猶以文稱雄於時，不職者每以為同宗，而不知其竟與柳宗元之於苑諭蕭　等也，今先生逝矣，吾知行嚴回念疇昔，又當如何沈痛，　淚以申悼忱也。</p>
<h3>拉門孩子</h3>
<p>— 朱少飛</p>
<p>每夜，我頭　醒來的時分，對門板門上「篤……」，跟著「好婆開門，好婆開門」的呌門聲，有時我會給這聲音呌醒了，熟悉的，是老虎回家的時候了，已是三點鐘啦。</p>
<p>老虎祗十三歲，他有着伶俐的嘴臉，有着拍馬一樣的本領。不論　邊是掛雨，或下雪，傍晚他就出現在朱葆山路那家水手舞塲的門前了。逢着生意清，縮進門角邊打一下盹，或蕩在門外邊雙手插着褲袋裏「一二，一二」地喊着學操兵。</p>
<p>不管過他眼前的是不是主顧，戴白帽的水手兵追上前嚷著　Come　in　Please　怪伶俐的孩子呵，他根本不知道這種話的意義是什麼，他的僱主教他這麼嚷他就這麼嚷。</p>
<p>主顧踏進門，拉着那扇比他小身體還重的彈簧門，同樣地出門的也是拉，不過跟在背後問着「Motor　Car」兜汽車生意了。兜汽車可最起勁，一輛有兩毛小洋回佣到手的。</p>
<p>老虎的爸爸去世了三年了，家裏祗有祖母跟媽媽，媽媽給人家做傭工，一部份的生活費全靠着老虎賺來過活呢。</p>
<p>弄裏的孩子中，老虎最可憐了，當人家同樣年齡的孩子放學回來的時候，老虎剛起身，抹把臉就提著飯格子上那家舞塲門前去拉門了。</p>
<h3>陳盧影展巡禮</h3>
<p>— 阿雲</p>
<p>月之二十日，陳傳霖與盧施福兩攝影專家合組展覽他們的新舊作品於大新公司四層樓。閱兩日，記者偷得半天間，便驅車到那邊去巡覽一番。</p>
<p>海上攝影藝術的空氣，像是岑寂得久了；偶然打從售賣柯達用品約商店門前經過，雖也瞧到幾幅，但係商品，而非藝術品。一旦陳盧影會開，許多厭倦機械生活而要求精神糧食的朋友，便被他們一大批地吸引到大新公司四層樓上來。記者入了塲，參觀者已將把廣大的會塲塞滿了，然而沒有一些細碎的聲音，記者也小心地把腳步放得輕輕地。先從陳先生的看起，一幅，一幅，又一幅，挨到盧先生的了，又一幅一幅地看下去。</p>
<p>在這裏，記者該說幾句外行話了。什麼巴黎沙龍，芝加哥沙龍，奧大利亞沙龍……我都不管；我要說我喜愛的幾福。陳氏的「石濤墨畫」「瀟湘圖」「近　遠黛」「　袖薄」，盧氏的「晚節」「青眼看人又一時」「閒情莫遺雪衣窺」，我覺得都是古代大畫師所曾慘淡經營而終沒有表現出來的意想畫；把攝影藝術凈化做中國畫稿，該推兩先生之技最神妙了吧？其次，就現實的題材來說，有蜿蜒萬里的古長城，有建築巍峨的碧雲寺，有岩影帆光的普陀山，有風沙迷漫塞外城，都可以給我們臥遊一回。至於「雪艇」之以筆調恬靜勝，「雪一堆」之以畫面渾脫勝，「關山萬里」之以境界恢容勝，「粉本」之以細膩泥人勝，「到天堂之路」之以用意深刻勝，我又莫能一一細說了。總觀此次成績，幾　遇以往黑白社任何展覽，我該這樣恭維他們。</p>
<h3>記所見</h3>
<p>— （趙德芳）</p>
<p>一星期不回家鄉（浦東）了，今天回去却遇見了一件可笑的事！</p>
<p>在我們那裏差不多每一個小兒的身上都佩　一塊紅色的布，布上還寫着字。是：</p>
<p>石匠　石和尚</p>
<p>造橋　有地方</p>
<p>不關　小兒事</p>
<p>有他　自己當</p>
<p>據說因為在新上海（有的說南京，有的說外埠，衆說紛紜，莫衷一是。）要築造一頂大橋，但是造不起來，所以要勾攝小兒靈魂數萬個，埋於橋下，這樣方能把橋建築起來。可是為要避免這災難，避免小兒靈魂的被勾攝了去，所以身上要佩這解法的東西？</p>
<p>不知誰信口揑造了這謠言，而竟又會衆相效尤起來，真是天曉得。中國人的無知盲從，於此可見一斑。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第三回　雨細風斜還來留跡處　夜闌人靜獨寫絕交書</p>
<p>那檐溜滴到傘上，水珠子直濺到巷子中心來。回頭看去，有事是讓他大大的驚異着，那就是這傘底下的那個人，正是料著不會出門的江小姐了。心裏有了感觸，在口裏就情不自禁的噫了一看不過這個噫字，剛剛出口，立刻覺是不對的，要把這噫字忍了回去。雖然這字音已經發出，不能完全忍回去，但是究把那個字的聲調去。低了下去。　實這一分驚訝，不但是他，就是那個女學生，也同，樣有了感觸，口裏有點聲音發出來。國器不知道他這一分驚訝是什麼樣意思了，打算見着面和他通言語的那個計畫，猶豫一下，可沒有來及實行。待到自己轉過身來已看到他有些難為情的樣子，把小雨傘微垂下來，半遮着臉離開了那個大門樓子下了。他為什麼在這個大門樓下躲雨，不到學堂裏去？這可有些奇怪。若說不是躲雨，站在這裏，進不進，出不出，又為著什麼呢？國器心裏想着，自不免回頭去看看，可是他也有同樣的感覺，已經把傘撐得正正當當，回過頭來了。不知他有了一種什麼快慰的事，只在彼此眼光對看到的時候，他將兩排白牙齒全露出來，笑着把頭一低。這一分兒笑容，完全是有一種高興的事，由心裏透出，自己又禁止不住，所以突破矜特的素，態究竟是笑了。國器怔怔的望着，有望到他轉了　，方才到學堂裏去。然而今天這一相次會，　管心裏很高興，究竟是有點遺憾的。為什麼不趁了這個機會，問一問他貴姓呢。今天這個機會是過去了，明天見着了他的時候，無論如何，要向他說出話去。看他今天這個樣子，像是很熱的人一樣，問起他的話來，就是他不答復，他也不會生氣的。那末，不必明天了，趁着他今天高興，今天就問他，那不是更好嗎？國器這一番心事，除了在課堂上教書之外，這一天始終是在心頭上徘徊着。到了下午下課的時候，却不料雨仍然是牽絲不斷的。而且還落着風勢是不小，手撐了傘在雨地裏走，雨由傘下橫飛過來，却吹了一身的水點。費了很大的力量，走到每次相遇的巷子裏，那位姑娘也來了。不過他這次不是步行，已經改坐人力改了。本來車蓬面前，那個油布　子，吊起來很高，一個身體小嬌的女子坐在車裏，這油布　子，完全是可以把他擋住的。（四○）</p>

<h3>香蕉皮</h3>
<p>— （柳鴻生）</p>
<p>曾記得今春全國與廣東隊决賽足球時，有一看客見廣東隊違反規則，出口就罵，旁邊一個廣東老動手就打，於是兩人其勢洶洶，都站了起來，後面的觀衆，因視綫被遮，香蕉皮齊下，他們沒奈何，都坐了下去，不打了，現在西南風雲日惡，我們民衆的香蕉皮安在？</p>
<h3>人也在走私</h3>
<p>— 海珊</p>
<p>走私的聲勢，充溢了各地，幸政府有相當制止的方法，可保工商業，不致走向末路的盡頭。</p>
<p>走私這個名詞，就會這樣的利害，可怕！</p>
<p>我想人的生理構造，和組織的複雜，也好比是一個小的社會，他日日也在走私呢！人的走私，可分有形走私與無形的走私，『浪費光陰』，就是無形的難挽回的重大走私，『患遺精病』，就是有形的走私，好比社會經濟外流的一般危險。</p>
<p>人的走私，是人的通病，容易忽略的一件痛心事啊！</p>
<p>人的走私，只要肯細心的禦防，適當的利用，也不是一回難事啊。</p>
<p>人也在走私，你道奇不奇，哈哈。</p>
<h3>十六</h3>
<p>一尺十寸，一斗十升，中國的「度」「量」單位多數都是用十進的；但是「衡」却不同，一斤十六兩，要十六兩才成一斤，</p>
<p>為什麼十兩不算一斤，要十六兩才成一斤呢？這個問題，也許諸君平日並不留意，說來却還有一段典故呢：「天下太平」四個字一定是生當亂世之民所日夜祈禱的吧？請諸位細心數數，這四個字的筆劃，不是恰巧十六嗎？古時候的人，因為日夜祈禱天下太平，所以連這四個字的劃數「十六」，也認為是吉利的，把它用在「衡」上，要十六兩才成一斤，</p>
<p>這典故雖然只是傳說於一般村夫市井之間，信不信由你；但却可從此窺見世人盼望天下太平之殷了！（紫英）</p>
<h3>談閏拾遺</h3>
<p>— 愛梅</p>
<p>巧得很！今年西歷是閏年，古歷也閏三月；早先我有談閏一文，載於本刋；現在聽人談，還有兩種關於閏的奇異的動植物，沒曾搜羅進去。因特補記如下</p>
<p>荔枝　嶺南的荔枝，據說：也同我前文所說梧桐葉，藕，和山花，優　北等物一樣；它是每枝結十二果，遇閏便結十三果了。</p>
<p>閏魚　山東大汶河裏面，出產一種閏魚；平常沒有，遇閏卽出；魚頭且象形當年的干支生肖，譬如：今年是丙子，丙屬火，是紅色，面子則肖鼠，道魚便生著通紅的鼠首；等到過了年，它便自行隱沒。這真好算天下之大，無奇不有了！</p>
<h3>陶社</h3>
<p>— 尙士</p>
<p>紹興東湖為陶濬宣氏所經營，湖在距五雲門十里許之小稷山下，其地有萬柳橋，橋西平軒兩楹，為紀念陶成章先生而建。</p>
<p>陶氏在民元前留學日本，因醉心革命，隨孫中山先生組織同盟會，集合同志，鼓吹革命，後以武昌起義，同志先後返國，先生亦遄返，參與革命工作，協贊浙省軍務，得力尤多，未幾，遭反革命者之暗殺，忠骨長埋後，同盟會同志曁其門弟子，遂為建立陶社，以垂久遠。</p>
<p>當民國元年，孫中山先生曾偕胡漢民氏曾一度蒞社致祭。至今二十餘年來，遊其地者，莫不臨湖遠眺，緬想其人焉。</p>
<h3>火葯氣</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>春三雜詩</h3>
<p>— 叔範</p>
<p>又是風前麥飯澆，飛灰影裏祗蕭騷，行人驅馬江城路，似與幽魂攘一瓢。（清明）</p>
<p>幽　無着證時心，祗化浮萍不化金，消受天風原自慣，吹吹何苦怨升沉。（楊花）</p>
<p>幾見痴蜂穿雪徑，客浪春江，開　不是，亦有飛花白一窗。</p>

<h3>論我國農村救濟的方式</h3>
<p>— 漆琪生</p>
<p>近年以來，我國農村經濟之凋憊，農產之銳减，農田之荒蕪，農民之貧困，農村之騷亂，以及養個國民經濟基礎之動搖，都市經濟之衰頹，工商各業之不振，經濟恐慌之惡化，於是國中人士皆不期而然的一致喊出了求濟農業，復興農村的口號，從事種種農村建設的運動，形成年來農村求濟的熱烈的現象。同時政府當局對於農村救濟問題，亦極注意。行政院在過去曾經設立過農村復興委員會，以司農村復興的專責。最近實業部更擬於七月中，創設農本局，在六年內由政府籌定經費三千萬元，以為救濟農村的固定獎金，並田民間各金融機關，共同籌備三千萬元，以為合放資金，專門辦理農民貸欵，農產抵押，與農產運銷等業務。其次，立法院孫哲生院長，亦曾指派立委數人，協議農村救濟的具體辦法和計劃，主張推行合作，以解决農民的資金問題。至於民間方面，則今年度中，上海各銀行的農村貸欵活動，更將擴大計劃，推廣範圍。如斯，則今後的農村經濟救濟運動，定將更加積極而具體化了。不過，我國農村經濟的救濟，究竟應該採用怎樣的方式，才能徹底而效宏呢？當此農村救濟運動盛行的時候，我們是必須深刻的檢討一下。</p>
<p>依據現今各種農村救濟運動的實際情形而論，對於救濟方法，千宗萬派，各不相同，但可概分為下面的六種：　農業生產關係改革派，例如軍事委員會的利用合作社運行；　農業生產技術改良派，例如歐美式的教授專家們所倡導的技術改良運動；　農村貨欵派，例如以華洋義振會為中心的信用合作社運動；　農產運銷派，例如近年上海各銀行在內地各省的農產抵押放欵，與農產倉庫的設置等活動；　鄉村教育派，當以定縣為典型；　鄉村自治派，可舉鄒平作代表。這些運動，方法互異，成效各別，妥當者固有之，錯誤者亦不少。在這六種辦法中，第一種方法最為艱難辛苦，第二種則較次之，惟有第三，第四，第五，與第六四種辦法，最屬輕便，易於施行，因之一般從事農村救濟者，多趨重後之四種，避棄前之兩種，極善就輕取巧。現試逐一加以檢討。</p>
<p>救濟我國農村經濟最有效而最妥當的方法，凡是能夠正確的把握中國農村經濟衰憊之根本病源的人們，都是一致的主張必須徹底的改革我國現行的農業生產關係。因為在現今的前資本主義之佃農經濟與自耕農經濟的生產關係下，農業技術的停滯，農業生產的衰頹，農民經濟的貧困，農村秩序的紊亂，皆是必然的結果。只有先將現行的農業生產關係徹底改革，建立新的合理的農業生產關係，使農民在這個新的農業生產關係下，方便而有利的從事生產，發展生產，庶乎始能解消中國農村經濟的　結，救濟農村經濟的凋憊，同時其他各種農村救濟與增進生產的辦法，亦始能發生其積極的效能。可是這種改造農業生產關係的方法，對於農村經濟的救濟，功效雖大，而困難特多；且其實質，並非單純的經濟技術問題，而是一個整個的農業政策和土地制度，必須由政府確立為重要國策，運用政治權力以推行之，始能成功，普通民間之從事農村救濟者，無由實現此種方策，惟有另循其他比較輕便的途徑。加以一般擁護現實的人們，對於這個辦法，多所畏忌詆毀，因而世人遂多不敢贊同，此實為我國農村救濟事業迄無偌大成效的主要原因。</p>
<p>其次，現有不少專家學者，醉心於歐美農業技術的進步，因而力倡以改良我國農業生產技術的方式，救濟我國農村經濟。殊不知農業生產技術之改良與發展，必須要在將旣成的朽腐的農業生產關係變革，建立新的適合生產技術的生產關係之前提下，始能積極的收穫圓滿成果。不然，則舊的朽腐的農業生產關係依然持續，匪特足以阻碍新的農業技術之利用，甚而還將因依存於原有的生產關係之種種榨取作用的作崇，乃使農民使用新式技術所增殖的生產利益，不能完全享受，徒為一般榨取者提供更多額的榨取利益，無救於農民的貧困。况且事實上農民在現行的苛重的封建生產關係之壓榨下，貧苦不堪，謀生猶難，毫無餘力以圖生產技術之改善，與新式農具之利用。基此二大主要理由，所以在現階段中，如果欲謀我國農業生產技術之改良，勢非先將構成農民貧困之根源的現行農業生產關係變更，不能為功。反之，如果避　此最根本而最首要的問題，只是空談皮相的農業生產技術改良，熱中於局部的設立農業試騐塲，與採用樣的方用新式農業技術及農具，企圖藉作示範標本，不但意義消極，跡近皮相，並且還犯了捨本圖末，避急就緩，隱諱淆亂我國農村經濟救濟的正確方策之認識的過失，是故我方今的農業技術改良論者，實際上常是帝國主義與封建勢力的維護人。</p>
<p>復次，農村貸欵問題，亦是同樣。倘若農村貸欵運動，不着眼於農村生產關係的改善，則其結果，僅是將都市的銀行資本，轉變為農村高利貸資本，而為都市金融另　投資的方向而已，對於農村經濟機構的腐朽，毫未改善。農民由從來農村高利貸者之債務奴隸的地位，現僅轉變為都市銀行資本的債務奴隸，負債的程度雖或稍輕，但貧乏的病根依然未除，仍不能徹底的救濟農村經濟。過去的銀行農村貸欵與信用合作社之活動，對於農村救濟成效些微的原因，卽在於此。</p>
<p>再如農產運銷問題，單純的發展這個運動，而不使之與農業生產關係改革運動相連　，則其結果，徒事擴大農業生產之商品化，增強都市支配農村的作用，更將促進農民的自給經濟之解體，而為都市金融資本完成統制農村的使命而已，卽不能積極的有助於農業機構之改善，以便農村凋憊之得徹底的解救，並且還將因都市金融資本之轉化為農村商業資本，其勢力極為雄厚而優越，最易獨占與壟斷農產市塲，實行高利墊欵，賤價預購的高利貸盤剝，與不等價交易之二重榨取，使貧苦農民屈處於市塲被人統制，交通被人封鎖的惡劣環境中，更加容易以極低廉的代價，喪失其農產品，影響其收入的激减，與生計的惡化。所以農產運銷運動的發展，雖然在表面上具有便利農產品資金化的效能，但是如果不在完全而全理的農村經濟機構中遂行，則其幣端，乃將促進都市金融資本，次第轉化為農村高利貸資本，與農村商業資本，對於農民的榨取，較之從來的封建剝削，不過五十步與百步之差。年間各地的農產運銷運動，卽具有如斯劣點，不能漠視。</p>
<p>又如鄉村教育問題，其對於農村救濟的作用，不外兩端：一為救濟農民的不學　識，藉教育以啟發其智慧；二為利用教育的方式，誘導農民參與各種農村經濟改革的實際活動。是故鄉村教育的本身，僅是農村救濟運動推行的一種手段，而非農村救濟運動的根本目的。單純的鄉村教育，不獨絲毫也不能解决農村經濟的各種問題，甚而如果沒有其他的經濟方法去解救農村，鄉村教育自身是不能維持，終必失敗。因為世間沒有一味唸死書，講道德，而能使飢有食，寒有衣的道理。農民最迫切的需要，是衣食住問題，知書職禮的要求還在其次，但解决農民衣食住問題的辦法，必須求之於教育問題外的經濟範疇中，特別的是在改善農業生產關係的行程中，最能使農民衣食住問題獲得有效而圓滿的解決。現今許多從事鄉教運動者，將鄉村教育看做是農村救濟的無上法寶，不二法門，試屬顛倒本末的錯誤見解。</p>
<p>最後，鄉村自治的問題，情形亦相類似。鄉村自治辦理良善的結果，僅是為農民建立了良好的農村社會之秩序，以便農業生產之進行，但其本身，依然不能使農村經濟獲得積極的解决。農村政策中所包含的所謂「教養衛」三大原則，畢竟是以「養」之一項，為解决農村問題的基點，决定沒有未能使農民吃飽飯，穿暖衣，住好屋，而可使農民安閭里，共守望，相扶持的道理。是以在做鄉村自治運動的另一方面，卽須從事農村經濟的改造，始能使鄉治運動的功，充分發揮，鄉村秩序始可長保安寗。尤其是對於現的封建的農業生產關係，乃是榨取和虐害農民的因素，紊亂鄉村秩序的禍種，更須力加改革。</p>
<p>由此種種理由，可知我國農村經濟的救濟，乃以改善現行農業生產關係的方式，最為妥善而合理。吾人如不謀我國農村經濟之徹底救濟則已，若欲徹底救濟，則須採取這個根本辦法，循依此條正確大道。就是欲走輕巧的途徑，無論是改良農業技術，或是從事農村貸欵，或是農產運銷，以及鄉村教育與鄉村自治等任何方式，亦皆須與農業生產關係改善運動相聯　。更正確的說，還須要在改革我國現行的農業生產關係之前提和目標下，以各種輕便的救濟方法，為達遂目的之手段，則其成績必更顯著，功效必更宏偉。</p>
<p>然則，推行這種改善農業生產關係的方式以救濟農村經濟的具體辦法，究竟又是怎樣？我對於這個問題的簡單答覆是：第一，政府必須早速厲行「耕者有其田」的土地政策，建立新的「耕地農有」的農業生產關係，廢止封建剝削之基礎的地主經濟，使農民獲得從事生產的基本手段，而自由生產，增進生產；第二，必須健全合作社的組織，推廣合作社的運動，特別的必須強力的發展利用合作社，使最大多數孤立分散而力弱的農民，悉皆參加合作社，經過合作社的機構，次第改善從來孤立的零亂的個人主義之農業生產關係，形成組織的系統的集體經濟之農業生產關係，俾可藉農民力量的團結，合作社組織的堅強，解决農村經濟的一切　結，更可在一定的計劃與指導之下，遂行耕地的整理，技術的改良，生產的增加，地利的啟發，與乎從事金融的融通，農產的運銷，鄉村的改良，鄉治的完備等；第三，在健全而堅強的合作社組織之下，農民在集體主義的生產過程中，由於協作勞動，與協作耕種的集體習慣與經騐，次第認識集體經濟的利益，漸感個人經濟的不善，覺悟土地私有權的障碍與不便，於是逐漸减輕其土地私有的固執觀念，漸次解放土地使用關係之限制，而將其所有土地提供予所屬的合作社管理，遂行齊一的合理的大農經濟之生產，提高農業生產力於最高階段，至是則不僅我國農村經濟得以激進發展，並且還使農業生產關係，更由個人主義的耕地農有之階段，進化至集體主義的耕地共管之　段，在緩進而和平的過程中，建立新的農業體制，實現孫中山先生所倡道的大同世界之社會。上述三點，卽是我對於我國農村救濟和改造的主張，惟本文因篇幅有限，僅示要點，餘容以後的機會，再為詳論。</p>
<h3>農販問題</h3>
<p>— 李寅北</p>
<p>農販在我國經濟上的評價</p>
<p>農販；本來在經濟的評價上，很有幾點足以稱道的。在我國的社會經濟方面，尤為顯著。</p>
<p>在資本方面　向來我國的農村產業和都市獎金，正如兩只滿盛清泉的瓦缸，假使沒有第三只空缸用來過渡，永遠是彼此不能相互灌注的。就是到了現在，情形仍然未變。都市裹面，雖然設備了倉庫與銀錢業，但是他們所謂「對物信用」，祗有農民把米，麥，雜糧，茶葉，烟草等搬運到他們的倉庫裹，他們方始取他們的資金來付與農民作交換。這就是所謂都市資本的運用了。但再就實際上論：農民是世居於鄉村的人民；距離都市，有數里，數十里；甚之數百里的遙遠。農產品不是隨身搬得動的東西，假使遇農民不想把農產品搬運到都市來求賣時，那末勢必祗有都市的資金到農村去遷就農產品了。但是根據資本運用的領域來觀察，都市資金的能否遷就到農村去收賣農產品；恐怕祗有幾種特殊的農產品而外，最普通的及產量最大的農產品，最是無力會誘致都市資金的到農村來！為要墊滿農村與都市中間的資本空隙，那末用誰的資本是沒有了。舉例以言：南京的「鄉梢」，多散集於四鄉的小鎮或較大的村莊。自備有　榖　米的器具，積有少數資本，向農家購進稻子，碾成糙米，然後運送京市求賣。其運送方法；用驢子背運，汽車裝載，或人力挑運，須視其數量的多少來决定。大抵數量較多道路較速者，多用驢子背運；接近公路者，亦有使用汽車運送；凡數量少而道途近者，則多為挑送。貨品運抵京市，卽自投廊行兜賣。客商交貨之後，卽向廊行清理貨欵。交易卽告結束。我們從上面一段事實看來，農販雖然是中間人的中間人；不離其剝削為業的本行。但是從他所墊出的資金，　榖　米器具，以及驢馬人工而言，倒又是有功於農商雙方的呢。</p>
<p>在價格方面　近來頗有人主張，將農產品合作共賣。在江蘇省農民銀行，且已設立農產運銷辦事處；代理農民或合作社共賣農產。共賣的主張，好說已從理論走到實踐上去。但是共賣的理論，是引人動聽的；而共賣的事實，却不能盡如人意的！其中最難解决的問題，就在產地價格與銷地價格沒有把握。假使依照共賣原則辦理，那末是以銷地價格（卽市塲價格）為標準；如江蘇省農民銀行農產品運銷辦法的價格取决，就是如此：據該辦法代銷品售價的規定，是：「分　產品到埠，卽照當地市價（卽銷地價格）出售。　由委托者（農民或合作社）限定最低售價；倘因限價太高，不能銷售時，得將原貨退還。一切墊付費用，仍由委托人負責償還。」假定依照此種辦法而實行共賣，那末農民一船米或是一船麥運到市塲上；遇當地的市價是高昂的，自可不生問題。市價是平平的，那就須算一算水腳開支方能脫售。萬一市價驟然跌落，在農民方面，共賣呢還是分賣？脫售呢還是不售？弄得農民進退兩難。勢必使參加共賣的農民，沒有一個不發生怨意。在產地價格與銷地價格，一忽上；一忽下，絕無一定保障的市况下，呌誰願意負此產銷中間因被運輸時間陰誤不能到達市塲的價格跌落之風險責任呢？祗有農販，對於此種風險責任，已習慣成為自然了。農販向農民收買農產品；其貨價，在產地早經依照產地價格付給農民。待農產品運達市塲，再行依照銷地價格販賣於行商。很明顯的，在農販經濟行為的「危險」，「管理」，「收入」三種的企業原素，都集中在他一個人的身上。他本人冒投資的危險；担負管理販賣上的工作。但同時遇銷地價格上漲時，就能接受所有的收入。在農產品共賣的農民，所負的責任，自當與此有別了。</p>
<p>（三）在農情方面　在資本雄厚的企業家，或許在想不假農販之手來到鄉村與農民直接握手。能做到如此，固然很好！但實際上是很困難的。舉例以言：　粉廠為農產小麥最大的顧主，廠方為要搜攬原料起見，都直接在小麥的產品設立辦麥處。當初計劃，本想直接向農民購買小麥；但是事實上，自行派往鄉村收麥者，都不能有圓滿的結果。不得不再行假手於商販。其中最困難的原因；是為農民的心理，　有外客到來收買貨物，每認自己的貨色為奇貨可居。常過分看高價格而不肯脫售。都市廠家在各產區自設辦麥處的人員，對於當地的地方情形，又不甚熟悉；而對於農民的心理習慣，又不明　。故不能應付裕如，而為有利條件之成交。唯有當地的行販人員，方有統御控制之能力。企業家不能明瞭農民的心理習慣，必然要引起農民愚魯的舉動來。農販的優點，就在能夠熟識鄉村間的風俗人情。因為農販除經營農業販賣而外，有些還是小地主與自耕農呢。</p>
<p>（四）在走漏方面　農產品運輸偷竊的弊病，憶成為公開的秘密了。如某處的『船家』。除運輸自己的糧貨外；凡帶有代運性質的，於運送途中，卽實行偷盜工作。平常偷取兩三石。偷取糧貨之後，再使用種種方法，以圖矇蔽；務使局外人無從察感。卽知之，亦認為公開的秘密！例如偷取者為米，在交貨前則施行洒水工作，米因吃水而膨脹；數量不致有虧。倘偷取者為榖子，則混入泥沙。數量重量，恢復如初。此種走漏，由來已久！變成慣例，已牢不可破！南京若干行店，本可自行赴鄉採辦糧貨；惟限於船家的走私，李皆裹足不前！照理此種舉動，是無道德不應該做的勾當；但在農販方面，反且藉此以為挾制商家的工具呢。</p>
<p>二，調整農販問題的方法</p>
<p>此外；關於農販問題的調整方法：目前我國的農販數量，沒有可靠的統計，可以明瞭他們的資格，販賣，和積弊等情形。因為據我們所知道的：目前的農販，因政府向來忽視的緣故，在鄉村搜攬農產品的時候，其剝削手段，無所不用其極！最著者，如變造度量衡，抑低貨價，重利盤剝等；自愿設法取締。但是根本辦法，還要靠農民自動組織起來。不過我們在前面說過，農民自動組織來實行農產品共賣，最困難的就在產地價格與銷地價格沒有確切的把握。共賣後，往往反要使農民發生怨意。使熱心提倡共賣的人，失去農民的信仰。要解决這個問題，祗有政府實施農產品平均販賣後方有辦法。但是在着手平均販賣之前，政府不　先來負擔貼補產地與銷地中間價格跌落的風險責任；作為厲行平均販賣事業的提倡。</p>
<h3>蘇俄的農業合作制度</h3>
<p>— 朱文炳</p>
<p>蘇俄的農業合作制度，現在正經過一種大變化，蓋蘇俄的任何制度，若從靜的觀點看來，極難描述。因為每一種經濟制度，都是在一種永久改組的狀態中。這種情形，尤以農業合作制度方面為然。農業合作制度，在一九二六年開始，在一種新的基礎上經過了一番改組。但是後來集團農塲運動，積極進行，又不得不把農業合作制度加以全部改組。那時，這種制度尚未完全組織成功。一九二六年，農業合作制度的改組，係以所謂『中心』（Centre）者為基礎，這種中心分為二大類；一類包括所有的農業中心，一類包括牲畜中心。前者為榖類中心，蔴類中心，果酒蔬菜中心等八種，後者，如羊中心，牛中心等六七種。上述種種中心，都依照俄國的政治經濟結構局組織。所以最低的便是村中心，其次鎮中心，再其次縣中心，省中心，最後乃至聯邦共和國的組織。不過實際上，並非各種中心都具備這種階級。一個鄉村中，往往沒有一個以上的中心，甚至全省中也沒有一個以上的中心。不過有時鄉村中可有幾個中心的代表。中心都　力設法使一鄉村專門生產一種主要物品，因此在該村中設立一相當的中心。但實際上，除了該中心所處理的主要物品而外，往往還有其他生產品。所以大凡有乘餘的生產品，卽使不是中心所處理的，也有中心收買，準備送到該中心的鎮組織，縣組織，省組織裹去一個村。以中雖所有一種牛乳中心的組織，但該村中若有少數剩餘的小鷄或鷄蛋，也可有牛乳中心收買。不過家禽生產品，應該在最方便的收集地點轉到家禽中心去。各省有一個中心聯合會，使各中心發生關係。而在各聯邦共和國中，更有一種省聯合會組成的聯合會。</p>
<p>這些中心，原來的職責。多半因代所屬合作社買賣生產品。但自發展以來，也頗着重生產活動。現在已創設了一種契約制度（Sistem　of　Contraction）。那是一種期貨的賣買計劃。例如榖類中心和鄉村或農民個人締結協定，由榖煩中心供給他貨物或勞務，而鄉村或農民個人則承認于收獲之後，償還代價，並將榖類賣給榖類中心。依照原來計劃，契約本可由中心與鄉村或個人締結。但自一九二九年收獲以後，已不再和農民個人締結契約了。契約的時間，可由一年至九年。根據契約，榖類中心承認供給肥料種子，甚至用機器代農民耕地。假若契約上規定所耕的田地係包括全部，則鄉村承認的農田的『條分制』取消。假若鄉村要自己耕地，則地要耕得很深很好。假若鄉村要自備種子，則鄉村應將種子挑選很好，然後才能下種。此外契約還有種種不同。至若鄉村榖類賣給的價格低。一九二九年，契約制度頗為盛行。該年的榖類，百分之七十五，都已規定在契約內，政府且希望一九三二年的全部收獲，要採用契約辦法。但自由要農塲發展以後，情勢大變。所有大部分的榖類，都經過集團農塲，而不輕榖類中心。將來也許集團農塲中心和榖類中心之間要成立協定，來補救道種情形，也未可料。至若　類中心的工作，與榖類中心相似，也採取契約制度。締結協定的種　地，也有百分之三十五。牛油中心的工作，也差不多。</p>
<p>合作中心的經濟來源共有四種：一是合作銀行的借欵，二是農業合作　用制度，三為國家銀行借欵，四為政府的補助。至若鄉村的收入，除了扣除應給各中心的數目而外，若有少許餘剩，也要儲集起來，作為公積金。</p>
<p>各中心的活動都有一個最重要的目標。就是要使農民養成一種共同的習慣，以為組織集團農準備。至若合作機關中服務的，並無不同的地位，和那此在國家機關中服務的，並無不同。他們第一對黨要忠心。至若他們所在合作機關的會員利益，他們並不認為重要。黨所批准的經濟計劃，才是最重要的。所以大凡對于全俄經濟最大目標有利的事情，合作人員無不盡力後事。我們　可大胆地說，蘇聯合作運動的大發展，並不是合作觀念的勝利，而是利用合作制度，以創造一種社會主義的經濟制度的例子罷了。</p>

<h3>特載　去年世界食糖之產銷</h3>
<p>— 王乃</p>
<p>一　世界食糖之消費</p>
<p>我國糖產　不足以自給，全國所用之糖，大都仰給於舶來品之補充，故世界食糖之產銷如何，殊與我國計民生有深切之關係。</p>
<p>世界糖業在近數十年來之最不景氣，莫過於去年之景况，全年糖價始終在無利可圖之同樣的低下水準之間，投機家固一無施展其手腕之餘地，工廠生產亦祗　保留其原有之比率，更無盛大關於糖　改革之舉行。其唯一足稱表現於事實者則為有幾國原科生產量之减縮。去年存糖减少一百八十萬噸，即其明證。此種現象在一般糖商視之，以為此後糖價必漲，奇貨可居，然而抑何知世界存糖之鉅，（世界存糖一九三二年為一二，〇六九千噸，一九三三年為一〇，五六八千噸，一九三四年為九，七五前途，正未可以樂觀也。當一九三二年五月九日在比京布魯　爾締結國際塘業協定之時，各參加國——尤其是東亞細亞諸國，無不滿望其銷量之增加，可是在會議時各國對於出口限制，競爭甚烈，致使事後結果皆未能就所　之數量出口，（因未參加者及乘機傾銷，故參加國之遵守，亦屬枉然。）茲將六年來之世界冰糖消費量列表如後：（單位千米突噸）</p>
<p>區別　一九二九——三〇　三〇——三一　三一——三一　三一——三三　二三——三四　三四——三五</p>

<p>（註）包括印度，爪哇及其他各區之糖</p>
<p>其總數雖較前三年略有增加，此或係在此一度協定之效，但與一九三一年以前相較，則相差遠甚。去年除歐亞與蘇聯外，其他各區則反較前年略减，此足見食糖之銷售力，實仍薄弱。　（未完）</p>

<p>康健之路</p>
<h3>神經衰弱與失眠</h3>
<p>可服荷爾蒙製劑</p>
<p>神經衰弱一症，與失眠有極大關係，而成功神經衰弱之由來，亦有種種，最普遍者，爲過度用功讀書，或持籌握算，操勞過度，以致神經漸漸變弱，而患失眠。有因靑春時期，因外界之引誘，及荷爾蒙之刺戟，釀成手淫，旦旦伐之，神經亦漸决失常，其圾著之症狀，不僅失眠，更有做事興趣索然，易動惱怒，精神煩躁不堪，終日忽忽，若有所失，而遺精，早漏，下部勃起力失常，因此益陷悲觀，心中苦悶，頭昏腦脹，貧血，肌肉輕鬆，失去彈力。面色蒼黃，食慾减少，記憶力不佳，四肢困乏無力，在女子爲乳部臀部，均不發育，月經遲至，月經因難，白帶下，其餘症象，與男子同。而久婚不　，亦為兩性恒見之症。</p>
<p>考其原因，不外内分泌之損失。欲挽救之，惟有補償內分泌，以使生殖腺發育完全。因此梅倫氏發明男用『補體康』，女用『補女容』二藥，其原料係從勇健靑春期之牝牡動物睪丸與卵巢。以科學方法，提出其荷爾蒙分別製成。服後能强壯與鎭靜神經，故能治愈神經衰弱與失眠，對於兩性靑春腺之組織，亦有偉大改造功效。凡男子遺精，早漏，勃起力不堅，女子月經不調，久婚不孕等，胥能治愈之。其成績實超過任何之荷爾蒙製劑也。</p>
<h3>克淋儂之治績</h3>
<p>淋病藥之最近新成功</p>
<p>淋病爲文明國家最大之威脅，彼能殘害國民之朝氣，毀滅生殖之能力，使民族陷於滅亡，所以一般人視淋病爲亡國滅種之一大疾患也。</p>
<p>因此一般科學家孜孜埋頭研究，思欲征服此亡國滅種之病菌，其中雖稍有發現，但終未能達到吾人理想中效果，以致淋菌仍到處猖獗，而淋病患者，觸目皆是。其中獨彼得氏所發明之『克淋儂』一藥，允稱治淋藥中之獨步。因『克淋儂』一藥，係純由殺菌抗毒之原料組製而成。服後其藥效能直接在病灶上發生作用，又以共在體內有發生抗淋免疫作用，故不調淋菌流竄體內何種部份，『克淋儂』皆能包圍而喰殺之，且能不傷害健康組織之分亳。此允爲其他淋藥中所不及之特長。所以不論部份的淋病如攝護腺炎，睪丸炎前後尿道炎精系炎，精囊炎，以及全身傳染之骨膜炎，關節炎等等，服『克淋儂』一藥後，均能克奏奇效。誠近代淋病發明史上一新奇之成績也。宜東西各國醫家，皆莫不樂於採用。至如女子患淋毒性白帶，亦可內服『克淋儂』，外用『卡而雪地氏陰道片』爲坐藥，亦能於短期內治愈。</p>
<h3>容易混同之腸胃加答兒</h3>
<p>腸與胃，實寫一姊妹臟器，蓋二者均主消化作用，飮食至於胃，經過相當之短時期，卽輸送入腸，然後始能發揮其充分之消化，若胃有炎性症狀（加答兒），則消化不良，　氣嘔吐，而大便亦失其常度，或乾結難行，或洩瀉腹痛，而腸炎亦有此等徵候，其原因固皆由誤食腐敗及飲食過熱過冷而來，値茲夏日，常人每不注意衛生，貪食冰淇淋及瓜菓生冷等物，因之引起本病者甚多，若不速寫處置，必致延為慢性，成為終身痼疾。</p>
<p>對於胃病治療，有減除粘膜之酸性及醱酵刺激，而重新改組其細胞，使歸入康莊，對於腸病治療，則須迅弭炎性機轉，而糾正其蠕動機能，故世之治療腸胃病製劑，功效各殊，惟法郞府化學廠「强胃精」一藥，漿有多方面之功效，因其乃酵酶及配用防腐消毒等成分製成者，不特可作爲腸內消毒劑，減除瓦斯，使大便秘結及空屁時洩者，立奏神效，其於洩瀉腹痛等，亦得淸瘳，而其主治胃病無論急慢性，噯氣頻頻，胸悶嘈雜，嘔吐泛噁，食後作脹，胃痛隱隱等，允爲對症良藥，其補血補腦之功，實爲偉著，藥內並含蛋黃素，爲戒烟及烟民便秘之良劑，性格王道，可作常年補品。</p>
<h3>遺精之療法</h3>
<p>遺精一病，因近來社會風靡，故本病患者，與日俱增，幾於人有此病，查市上遺精各藥，層見迭出，大多徒事堵塞精道，因而副作用甚大，惟若减少性神經之自家刺激，則其製劑必有良好效果。</p>
<p>耐氏『育精片』一藥，善能調整性組織及糾正性神經，故遺精不論每週間數次，或白畫漏精，大小便與用時，精液滑洩等，此藥皆有良效，因本藥能增强意志，故服後自能戒除手淫，而由遺精引起之神經衰弱，眩暈頭痛等，亦獲根治，聞本埠四馬路中西大藥房有售云。</p>
<h3>對於最新淋病治法之批判</h3>
<p>淋疾隨世界文明之進步，愈見蔓延，醫師治療之手續，不離乎內服，注射，透熱等療法，然推其傳染之徑路，則由於淋菌侵入尿道，故減菌之法，實爲最要之目的，從來所製滅菌劑，雖名稱衆多，顧有效者百難獲一，非謂其毫無寸效也，蓋因共只能作用于局部透膜殺菌，不旋踵又復再發耳，惟近頃歐洲各國，對於淋病之非特異性療法，最爲稱賞，據各大醫院報吿，經短期內治愈，而確證不發者，男子百人中達九十三名以上，女子則有九十五名之譜。故科學萬能之說，洵非虛語。</p>
<p>非特異性療法者，蓋用動物體中之免疫元，及植物之類脂肪，以促生人體之偉大抗毒力是也。「克淋儂」一藥，即具有此項效用，蓋其乃根據此種藥理，製成之內服劑，以其係非特異性療法，故能賦予細胞以偉大之抗毒機能，昂進白血球之喰菌作用，以是人體及血液中，突來此源源不絕之抗菌力，而淋菌縱使如何頑强，亦無法生存矣，則男女凡患急慢性之淋症及重症關節炎，男子攝護腺睪丸膀胱諸炎症，女子子宮淋，膣道淋等，均能藥到病除，於數星期內，確收全部治愈之功，徹底根斷，况又藥性王道，毫無刺激及敗胃等流弊，但在購服時須認眞注意「克淋儂」三字，勿爲他人朦混之言所愚，而誤購雜牌廉價劣藥，致服後影響他部健康，或引起生命危險也。</p>
<h3>肺癆與哮喘</h3>
<p>肺癆之症，其主症爲喀血或咳痰，呈顯著之衰弱現象，共决則食慾銳减，盜汗身倦，每有併發氣管炎或心臟衰弱，而起哮喘者，但哮喘多發于中年以上之人，其外表上則見面色蒼白，而帶浮腫，痰飲甚多，其治療之方法，須多事安靜休養，而服以强壯劑。</p>
<p>夷考舊來成藥，每不能盡合醫師臨床之意，蓋善治肺癆者，未必能防止氣管之炎性症增惡，及有强壯作用，又治一般呼吸器炎症者，往往不能專治肺癆，殊難萬全也。</p>
<p>徒氏以其心得，自各種礦物劑中抽出其有效成分，經科學的特殊手續，配製而成，「補肺拿爾」一藥，對於呼吸器各種疾患，均奏奇效，以其有防腐作用，故哮喘痰飲症可獲治愈，而防止肺之壞疽，他如傷風，百日咳，九咳頑痰等，服之無不奏騐，因本劑之藥效，善于增加體內石灰質，故肺癆服此，即得增生結締組織，包圍結核菌，因之結核菌失其活力，則毒素流出自少，而潮熱盜汗，身體無力之症，遂歸瘳平，其喀血血痰，咳嗽胸痛，貧血胃呆等，亦可因本劑之滅癆抗菌，壯補體力等作用而得吿除。在婦女月經不調，男子遺精腎虛之患癆者，及兼有腦弱失眠心悸等症，可同時於服本劑外，漿分別服以女用「補女容」及男用「補體康」，則婦女可獲經調血旺，男子可獲精强腎固，雙方投治，未有不枯楊生秭，衰木回春者！</p>

<h3>「克淋儂」治騐一束</h3>
<p>膿血迸出</p>
<p>患者嚴持寳君，新患淋病，症象頗爲險惡，其局部之症狀爲尿道刺痛，龜頭炎腫，包皮內亦因積垢甚多，以致受此等刺　而亦發炎，紅腫，尿道內膿血迸流，尿意頻催，欲小便則又困難異常，往往小便半小時，仍不能泌出幾點，其全身症狀，爲身發高熱，精神萎靡，體倦，口渴等等，曾投醫服藥，迄鮮功效。乃改服「克淋儂」，未及二星期，炎症大减，小便亦覺暢利許多，故痛苦不若從前之甚。乃續服十餘天，所恩全愈，曾到醫生處行消息子刺戟法，迄無淋病變動。證明其根治云。</p>
<p>體虛白濁</p>
<p>患者劉仁叔君，體本虛弱，故恒爲病魔所困。嗣叉作北里之遊，致更罹淋毒，惟因其身體虛弱，故所患淋病，並無若何劇烈症象，但亦並不見愈，而身體更虧。迭經醫治，未有寸效。嗣由醫生介紹進服「克淋儂」以除淋毒，同時並以「補體康」一藥以强壯其身體，遂在最短期內，將淋菌根本肅淸，而身體亦壯碩逾恒，前後判若兩人云</p>
<p>同病相憐</p>
<p>患者謝靑峯君，因性喜交際，以致患得淋病，未幾復傳染其夫人，以致夫婦二人幸福，恒被此淋菌所呑噬，謝君會歷遊國內各大商埠，皆無不駐車醫治，而效騐不著，懊恨驅車而返。幸後由同事會孟實君，得獲服治淋特效藥「克淋儂」，服之未幾，即卓著功效，又續服數星期，始吿就痊。乃復購「克淋儂」半打，及「卡而雪地氏陰道片」數瓶，爲爲其夫人淋毒性白帶病之用，其夫人自內服「克淋儂」，外用「陰道片」爲坐藥後，病熊日有起色，白帶减少，陰部糜爛部份亦愈。一切恢復如常，未幾更獲一子云。</p>
<p>關節作痛</p>
<p>患者伍芬庭君，罹淋病已五六年，迭治不逾，致變成關節炎，關節腫痛難以屈伸，兼之尿質汚濁，淋絮綦多，有時小便不快，且尿後繼之以血，睪丸亦覺微硬腫痛。乃由朋友沈詰雄君介紹服一克淋儂」，經半月以上，腫痛已去六七，運動自如，乃又繼服不輟至數星期而全愈。並經血淸檢查十數次，並無一次淋毒反應，故至今數年，從未再發。故伍君夫爲感謝，到處揄揚「克淋儂」效力之宏大正確云。</p>

<h3>姚菊巖醫師淋病講座</h3>
<p>診所：四川路寗波路轉角　診時：上午十時至下午六時。　　容易與痔疾混雜的淋病</p>
<p>痔疾是肛門部份之疾患，原與淋疾毫不相干，但許多淋病患者，往往不自知其病之變化。本來是一種淋病的續發症，而誤以爲叉新起其他疾患。舊病旣然未去，新病又生。於是憂欲驚惶，不可終日。徒使淋菌以可乘之機。病態因而加惡。實是一種極危險之錯誤也。許多人所謂痔疾也，實是直腸淋，此症每起於淋毒分泌液沾染肛門的粘膜，或起於攝護腺炎，精囊的膿痬其症狀爲肛門周圍發赤，流黃色膿液。後來往往有出血，糜爛，肛門由潰而狹窄，竟致不能大便。積垢愈多，淋菌愈衆，所生之危愈大。若醫治不碍其法，則肛門愈後，多留硬結，致失去肛門之伸縮性。而成爲肛門狹窄。</p>
<p>此等症狀，病家每不注意，故恒多由痔疾專家介紹我處。余所遇患老，多爲肛門腐爛不堪。膿液泊泊而出，乃爲之用藥洗滌後，繼用坐藥及電氣療法。同時進服治淋特效藥，數星期後，病毒大減，繼服用數星期而全瘳，肛門部位，恢復如常熊，惟此病因膿液淋漓，最易沾染異性。故如已結婚者，其妻子必染淋毒性白帶，宜外用「陰道片」爲坐藥，內服治淋特效藥以除淋，內外兼治，獲效亦速。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>雜談</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>據二十六日漢口電，桂軍二十四日在祁開始接觸後，祁衡間沿湘江風雲日緊，各報今日登桂軍攻衡消息，謂桂軍進攻衡城，駐軍未還擊云云，湘省風雲，一張一弛，其中內蘊若何，實難令人逆料，惟在此戰雲密布的狀態中，流血之慘，終恐難免，回想起九一八後，日人卽高唱以華制華的政策，不料我國竟重演此種局面，不能不佩服日人的聰明。</p>
<p>日輪大榮丸在歧口開槍，與海關緝私巡輪衝突事伴，據日軍發言人石井，前日接見華報新聞記者時，聲稱，歧口事件，係由誤會而發生，當時日輪誤認海關巡輪爲海盜船，致雙方開槍射擊，卽據石井所云，則大榮丸事件，完全由日方誤會而發生，因爲日輸誤認海關巡船爲海盜，故發槍射擊，則此種誤會責任，應由日方負責，乃有田竟訓令川越想我嚴重杭議，並派驅逐艦兩艘到靑島警備，眞所謂雄貓不發雌貓發，令人浩歎。</p>
<p>魯省府韓主席，前日召當地新聞記者談話，勗勉新聞記者少談國際事情，免得惹起重大糾紛，與不安狀態，言論界要處處爲人民着想云云，這是韓主席忍辱負重的忍耐工夫，不能不令人佩服，其實越怕惹起糾紛，而糾紛愈多，越怕狀態不安，而不安愈甚，日本當局，看準此點，一面用水鴨外交，一面用武力威懾，雙管齊下，而素願已償，目的已達，故韓主席謂言論界要處處爲人民着想，不可惹起糾紛，此語實所未解。</p>
<p>法文上海日報云，今年暑假，華人之赴日本避暑者，人數突增，其數己逾五千人，聞某美商輪船公司艙位，已爲人預定一空，故依日本觀光局之預計，今夏當有四五萬華人赴日，據日人云，此誠爲中日親善之良好現象云，我聽見此語，心中十分難過，不知赴日避暑諸君聞之，共威想若何？</p>
<p>吳愛蓉與啞情人林吉姆熱戀一事，因爲家長的反對，竟至法庭相見，結果父母的愛情，不敵情人的愛情，成就了兩人的春屬，此種風流佳話，頗爲社會所欣羨，說者謂這樣婚姻，是千辛萬苦滴水滴凍的結晶，美滿良緣，必能白頭偕老，最是可靠，不料時未數年，已生孽種，而愛蓉態度，突然大變，她曾經向鄰人表示，謂「一定要達到離婚目的，無論怎樣，都不能阻止，但在熱戀之時，父母怎樣的勸吿她，她定要遠到結婚的目的，無論怎樣，也不能阻止，眞是旣有今日，何必當初，人心的不可靠，於此可見，愛情的不可靠，亦於是可見，靑年男女須要留神，不可上當。</p>
<h3>扇</h3>
<p>— 楞嚴</p>
<p>新賣一把扇，黑紙的摺扇，長不滿市尺的七寸，或則在六寸半以內也難說。除大骨外，有二十六根小骨。</p>
<p>我大概舊的迷戀，眞的很深了，對於這把小小的摺扇，幾乎有超物質以上的愛好，學一句時髦話，那末就是在這把摺扇下，我做了許多夢，許多美麗而陳舊的夢。</p>
<p>深自矜持，這許多夢我不說，這裏我只說一點和扇有關的話，</p>
<p>我第一决用摺扇，是在十二歲那年，以前是只有芭蕉扇來撲蜻蜓的，那一把摺扇和現在一把差不多長，小骨也差不多，不過扇面不是黑的而是一邊印着靑綠山水，一邊密密的蠅頭小楷是白居易的長恨歌。長恨歌，我那時已經會談談所以對於這把摺扇深自愛好，</p>
<p>在我們那邊女人們是不用摺扇的，年紀大些的，用芭蕉扇，較爲年靑的，就是很細的蒲扇，而少女們呢？她們大概用團扇，</p>
<p>在鄕下自然沒有很考究的團扇所以她們有的，也不過是白紗做的，最多畫着疎朗的花卉。在我十五歲的那年忽然感到團扇的美麗了，於是我也去弄一把，純白的，沒有花，爲什麽不用花的呢？太女孩子氣，怕人笑。這把團扇，一用二年，到十六歲，寫上李義山兩句請送給一個女友了，「扇裁月魄羞難掩，車走雷聲語未通」下句是幷不確實的，不過因爲上句有一「扇」字，就胡亂的寫上了，</p>
<p>此後我就只用摺扇一直到現在，我總是每年賣一二把，</p>
<p>陸游詩「吳中近事君知吾？團扇家家盡放翁，」這是放翁非常得意的事情，綠楊倚路，小閣鄰溪，每當「夕陽正在煙柳斷腸處」的時候，有美一人倚窓閑眺，「閑執輕綃白紈扇，素手一時如玉，」這景境實在不知是詩是畫！</p>
<p>宋以前沒有褶扇，元初東南夷使者持聚頭扇，人共笑之。聚頭扇就是摺扇。到了明初，摺扇大行，原因是「出入懷袖殊便」，但正因爲便而容易失去，古時的摺扇大，還不妨，像我現在買的小摺扇，總是常常遺失的。</p>
<p>團扇自然是圓的，「裁爲合歡扇團團似明月。」但也有六角扇，王右軍就寫過老嫗的六角扇。</p>
<p>褶扇摺下來雖則沒甚麼好看，但展開時，實在十分美麗，特別是他的圖案的式樣，使我歡喜。舊式的　格扇面，案形和氷梅等，輓近美萊隖的歌舞影片片也常常把一個塲面的背景弄成扇面式。</p>
<p>據說在明代扇子眞的四季流行的，不像現在那樣，只用一個夏天。明代用的是褶扇，「出入懷中甚便」的緣故，所以可以一年不離手。像紈扇之類，是不行的。「紈扇秋捐」不是很久的成語嗎？</p>
<p>滬上一切都進步，特別是女人用的東西。卽論褶扇，已往有用美麗的羽毛做成的。但羽毛做的「扇」也是古已有之的「周昭王時聚鵲翅爲扇，漢時乘輿用雉尾扇，諸葛武候吳猛皆執白羽扇，庾翼上晋武帝毛扇。」不過毛做的摺扇，乃是近年的產物罷了。</p>
<p>扇的本義不外招風和障物，但是後來扇就成了飾物，有許多扇是不大便於取凉的，像我現在買的一把，就不是取凉的東西。</p>
<p>在一把小小的摺扇上，我做了許多夢，許多美麗而陳舊的夢。這一些夢什麼時候實現呢？於是我想着一把小小的洒金的摺扇，那一把摺扇是有着淡靑色的「流蘇」和小小的白玉的扇墮的，</p>

<h3>讀「南遊十記」（中）</h3>
<p>在我還沒有介紹這一本「南遊十記」以前，我想提出來的，最近文壇上有人極力提倡的「報吿文學」，所謂「報吿文學」，便是根據作者所觀察的事實，用政治，經濟透視的眼光，把所看見的事實，作一種批判式的報吿，在這一種「報吿文學」裏，作者應當强調地指出帝國主義者的迫害，統治階級者醜惡，以及現社會最眞實的面相。</p>
<p>而「南遊十記」呢？作者便是把握着這樣主旨，去寫作這一本游記的，允其是第九記的「澳門中山」和第十記的「香港游觀」裏，作者不單指明了社會的不景氣，同時也是指明了帝國主義者給予這兩地的迫害</p>
<p>有這本遊記裏，一共包含十篇遊記，它們的題名是：第一記「江行之樂」，第二記「長沙一日」第三記「淥河大樹」第四記「南嶽登臨」第五記「衡陽聞見」第六記「郴山郴水」第七記「山水橋洞」第八記「廣州名勝」第九記「澳門中山」第十記「香港游觀」。</p>
<p>除了這十篇遊記以外，後面還附印了作者在旅程中，在申報發表的十篇通訊，題目是漢粵紀行一，因爲是用文言寫的，叙事比較簡單。</p>
<p>關於此决作者南遊的動機，作者在「自序」裏寫得很淸楚，他說：「我此次南游，重要的任務，是參觀粵漢鐵路株韶段的工程情况。行程是從上海出發，以火車到京，換乘長江輪至漢口，渡江後，由武昌徐家棚，遵粵漢鐵路南行。沿錢驗足的地方，若長沙，株州，淥口，衡山，南嶽，衡陽，郴州，宜章，坪石，樂昌，廣州等處……」。除了遊記以外，每一個地方，都附有揷圖，這種地方色彩很濃厚的風景片，對於讀者，的確增加不少興趣的。</p>

<p>— 徐疾</p>
<p>近黃昏的時候，灰黃的天空疏疏地飄着「牛毛雨」，早橋邊的那家「大牆門」王宅的後門口辟拍地放起了單調而凄凉的小砲仗來，接着，兩個伕子默默地抬了　口白木的薄棺，悄悄小地從那狹的後門裏出來，費力地走向荒凉的黃昏的野外去了。這麽着，從淸早起就來候着的，被「王公館」裏的門房攔着不放進去的林弟娘，便開始用了五十六歲的破啞的嗓子，橡爆發一樣地號哭起來了，哭聲飄蕩到好遠，這中問，飽和地溶化着一些說不出的怨恨，與沈重的生活的哀愁。三串紙錢在門外的泥地上孤獨的燃燒着，用細弱無力的火熖來舐蝕了那些單薄的紙灰，細雨霏霏地淋下，在一縷輕烟中，火熖變了慘綠的顏色，可怕地在紙灰中間閃耀，接着也就無言地熄滅了！一切都顧得那麽沈寂，二個林弟娘用七十個銅子向鎭上去喚來的穿了破舊的黃袈裟的和尙在紙錢灰面前不合腔地低低地唸着七七四十九遍「枉生咒」，唸完了之後，想起了躺在棺材裏的年輕的林弟，想起了從林弟娘那裏聽來的一個不幸的豸虫的一生，便都用了一種說不出的哀愁各自在心裏默禱；「願死去的快快枉生極樂，再去投一個好好的人生，而活着的也好好地過下去吧，」那樣地，慢慢地跟着林弟娘隨了棺材走去，一面用無法的，生疏的聲氣對哭得發了狂的五十六歲的老婆子說：「林弟娘，你也看破點吧？大人家的老爺太太總是那樣的，總怪林弟命苦一也是命裏註定了的，沒有法子的呀。你也是五十開外的人了，自己身體要緊。死的已經死了，儘哭儘哭也沒有什麽用呀，好了，快不要那末難過……」</p>
<p>可是經人那麽一提，一種說不出的感情又勃勃地騰起來了，心裏是漫瀰着一種酸苦的感覺，在這中間，摻和了仇恨，悔怨，思念……一切人間的哀愁在心裏調合起來，眼淚像泉水那樣地直湧，接着便更響地哭起來了。「我還活着故十麽！我……是的，原也是我自己不好，十七歲的女兒，就讓王家拿五十塊錢的舊債逼去做了小，去的時候林弟還說：這　回我恐怕見不到媽了……然而，誰知道呢？王家的那大兒子早夜地纒着她，把她當一座器具，一種另外的生物……」</p>
<p>棺材在前面擺動，抬着的人哼哼地喘着氣，四野裏漸漸地在暗起來，黃昏了。</p>
<p>林弟娘的嘶啞的哭聲漸漸地變得無力而低微了，度過的悲哀把她陷進了半昏迷的境地，而死了的女兒底傷慘的記憶模糊地浮了起來：</p>
<p>「於是，女見終於被器械般地蹂躪，連我去探一探也不給允許，過去後才一個月，偸偸地到我那裏來哭了一個下午……」</p>
<p>「命是那麼的苦啊，」日子是在殘暴與眼淚中過去的，於是「大少爺」在縱慾的那些日子中得了癆病，死了。</p>
<p>大老婆發瘋一樣地跳了起來，在每個人面前都那麽說：「那個狐狸精好，把他弄死了！」，其餘的族裏的人也那麼地相信，說林弟的命硬，把男人硬生生地尅死了。</p>
<p>「拆家精啊！」於是，大老婆每天打着，駡着，而那　大個子的七十五歲的「老太太」也撕住牠底頭髮：「尅家星，你給我去死，你……」</p>
<p>打着，罵着。鞭打的時候用藤條抽，不給飯吃，關在一間小屋子裏，有三天。</p>
<p>「狐狸精啊，尅家精啊！」尅死男入……」</p>
<p>林弟哭得怎麽樣子，那是難以想像的，裏面有話傳出來了：林弟被磨折得半死，祇是上面吩咐了的：不準那個她底老婆子的媽來看她。</p>
<p>到第四天給放出來的時候，已經疲弱得沒有人形了，癫疲地，祗是在後園的那口井裏跳了下去……</p>
<p>一口薄薄的棺材悄悄地盛着一個不幸的命運，如今，她安靜地躺着，她再也不會「尅」死人了，她底命運披露了最後的一章，而拖在這一章後面的，也祇是班班的五十六歲的老婦人的眼淚了。</p>
<h3>花鼓戲</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>上海人所謂申曲，在我們鄕下呌做花鼓戲，也有人說是東鄕調。</p>
<p>花鼓戲在農村裏面，我以爲是最通俗的一種戲劇，爲的是說白，唱句，都是本地口音，什麼都聽得出來。聽慣花鼓戲的，劇情都背誦得出，唱句，正和北邊人每個都能哼幾句京戲一樣，誰也能够唱得出幾句的。</p>
<p>唱花鼓戲的人，角色之中，也分生，日，丑，老旦等等，速同拉胡琴，點鼓板，和打鑼的大概祗要有十個人，就可成爲一個很完備的班子了。他們除了胡琴，鑼，鼓板而外，祗有一隻梳頭籃，服裝每是就在演戲的那個村莊上借來的。</p>
<p>農村裏的人們，覺得他們的生活是太枯燥了，想尋找一些娛樂，那麽花鼓戲所費旣不多，而且對白，唱句，又什麽都可以聽得出來，是再通俗不過的戲劇，於是便在自己的村莊裏面，挨戶凑集幾塊錢，邀一班花鼓戲來唱唱。（未完）</p>

(27th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Part of the Guangdong Army Arrives at Huanggang; Report that Shaoan Was Occupied is Inaccurate; Southern Fujian Plans to Establish Bandit Suppression Headquarters; Two Newly Formed Armies Will Be Established Next Month</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) Part of the Guangdong Army has arrived at Huanggang, a few dozen miles away from Shaoan. The report that Shaoan was occupied is inaccurate. The situation in the Hangyong area is as usual. The authorities plan to establish a Bandit Suppression Headquarters in southern Fujian, under the jurisdiction of the Third Pacification Headquarters, to be solely responsible for the pacification of southern Fujian. It is rumored that Yu Nianci will fill the position of commander. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) The Provincial Government issued an order on the 27th appointing Yu Nianci as the Commander of Bandit Suppression in Southern Fujian, and all local militias are under his command. He is scheduled to take office in Quanzhou on the 29th. Yu was originally the Deputy Director of Security and is very familiar with various factions of the militia and the local situation in southern Fujian. Bandit suppression and appeasement are expected to be effective. The major bandit gangs Zhang Kewu and Zhang Chengfu have expressed their willingness to accept appeasement. Their more than 500 troops have gathered at Yongde Jiaoshan Toujitouyang, waiting for the Security Office to send personnel to count and reorganize them. In addition, the bandit Lü Zhenshan of Anxi joined forces with Long Zhicheng's rebel soldiers and infiltrated the Anyong border on the 26th. The Fifth Regiment is currently suppressing them. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) According to reports, Chen of Guangdong has been secretly advancing towards the Fujian-Jiangxi border with five divisions of troops, and his aim seems to be in southern Jiangxi. The various units currently stationed on the Fujian border are guarding the key points and are on strict alert. The reporter visited Zhao, the Director of Security, yesterday and inquired about the truth of the current situation. He sent a representative to meet with me. According to the discussion, the order in Hangyong and other places is currently the same. As for the details of the front lines, this office has not received any telegrams and cannot inform you. Because the troops currently stationed in western Fujian are all national troops, and each unit is directly commanded and dispatched by the Pacification Office, all military affairs are directly discussed with the Pacification Office, so this office has recently found it difficult to fully understand the situation on the front lines. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The two newly formed Guangdong Fourth and Fifth Armies will not be established until July 15th. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li Huanxu, Director of Military and Political Training of the First Army, led the staff to leave the province for Yu on the morning of the 28th. It is rumored that the Jiangnan Pacification Area has been ordered by Guangdong to end. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Xu Fei, the president of the Guangzhou Bo'ai News Agency, was detained and interrogated at the headquarters on the 27th for publishing military news and then released on bail. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The expansion of the Guangdong Fourth and Fifth Armies has been decided internally by the headquarters but has not been officially announced. Miao Peinan is willing to serve as the commander of the Fourth Army due to historical reasons, but Chen Jitang has refused, so the formation of the Fifth Army has been delayed. The commander of the Fourth Army will still be Huang Renhuan. Currently, the able person of the Guangzhou Bo'ai News Agency has been detained for publishing the news of the establishment of the Fourth and Fifth Armies. (28th Shen Shi Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) After regaining his freedom, Miao Peinan was unhappy. Although Chen Jitang earnestly persuaded him to take the position of commander of the Fifth Army, he politely declined due to his unrecovered health.

<h3>Darong Maru Incident Reaches a Stage in Local Negotiations; Focus Shifts to Beijing and Will Be Handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Japanese Navy Wants to Take Advantage of the Issue</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) In the Darong Maru case, the Japanese Navy is advocating a tough stance and wants to take advantage of the issue. The minimum goal is to disarm all maritime anti-smuggling forces at the Tianjin and Zhifu Customs in the Bohai Bay. The Tianjin Army Department has made no statement on this. As of the 28th, the local negotiations have reached a stage, and the focus has shifted to Beijing. Tianjin Customs, following the instructions of the Ministry of Finance, has not provided a direct written response, but only supplies materials, which will be handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to avoid disrupting the process. Akatani, the Japanese Tax Commissioner of Tianjin Customs, is also dissatisfied with the Japanese side's actions and the expanded publicity in Japanese newspapers.

<h3>Future Trends of American Political Disputes</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>The Democratic National Convention in the United States has already nominated Roosevelt on the 27th as the party's candidate for the next president and passed a party platform to support the current government's New Deal. The posture of American political struggle has been clearly defined, and the question from now on is which of the Republican and Democratic parties can gain the sympathy of the majority of the people. Whether the current policy will continue or change depends on the strength of the two parties' competitiveness in the next four months. If the Republican Party wins, the new reforms and new measures in American politics, economy, and society in the past four years will inevitably change direction and return to the original state of the Coolidge-Hoover era. If the Democratic Party maintains its power, there will be more progressive reforms in the American social order in the next four years, and the old forces will gradually decline and new ideas will gradually gain momentum as an inevitable result.</p>
<p>The evolution of society is often subject to the interaction of two forces, sometimes in harmony and sometimes in conflict. One is the force to maintain the status quo, which is inertia, and the other is the force to break the status quo, which is centrifugal force. In times of peace and prosperity, the force to maintain the status quo is strongest. When the economic downturn arrives and society is uneasy, the faction that breaks the status quo gains prominence. In the economic sphere of the United States, those who advocate maintaining the status quo are the financiers of Wall Street, the industrialists of the eastern metropolitan areas, and international merchants. In the political sphere, the Republican Party is the central group that advocates maintaining the status quo, and extremists include the Ku Klux Klan and veterans' associations. In society, those who advocate maintaining the status quo are the upper class, the propertied class, patriots, democrats, and liberals. They are timid to experiment, lazy to take risks, nostalgic for the glory of the past, alarmed by dangerous words and new systems, and the Republican Party's platform and presidential candidate in this election fully embody this kind of color.</p>
<p>The forces of reform are not easy to grow in American society. The Democratic Party's victory in the last election before the great economic depression was impossible. Recently, the economic situation has gradually improved, and industrial activities have gradually approached the peak of 1929. In the cities, smoke is gradually seen from chimneys and machines are spinning, and people who have moved for a long time are thinking of stillness and those who have changed for a long time are thinking of constancy. It is not without reason that the Republican Party is gradually gaining popular support. Although the American industry has been thriving, the symptoms of the capitalist system have intensified. The unemployment problem cannot be solved. According to reliable estimates, there are still more than 10 million people in the United States who have the ability to work but cannot be accommodated by the industry, and the imbalance between rural and urban areas, the government's debt is like a mountain, and the budget cannot be balanced. All these factors do not allow for early optimism. If the Republican Party takes power, it will inevitably repeat the tragedy of the Hoover era, and once there is a reaction, the forces of reform will be strengthened once. If reform is ineffective, revolution will follow. Therefore, for the United States as a whole, it is only more beneficial and less dangerous to allow the Democratic Party to continue to hold power for four years.</p>

<h3>Random Notes on Art "No Plucking" (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>However, we must also consider the park administrators. The tourists mentioned above are, after all, well-behaved and humble people. If he didn't smoke and his buttons were all fastened, he could be called a perfect person in the New Life Movement. But there are not many people like this in the world. Among the visitors to the park, many people want to pluck flowers and break branches, many people want to harm the fish in the pond, many people want to trample on the grass, and many people want to intentionally or unintentionally destroy the equipment in the park. If these killjoy "prohibitions" are not hung in the park, I am afraid it would have long ceased to be a park and become a ruin. Moreover, the "prohibition" warnings are only effective in slightly civilized places. In many public scenic spots, the silent "prohibition" is completely ineffective. I have personally seen people wearing decent long gowns plucking double-petaled peach blossoms next to a sign that says "No Plucking." I have also personally seen people leisurely washing their trousers while sitting under a sign that says "No Washing." I have repeatedly seen people leisurely urinating under the large characters "No Urinating." For this kind of person, even if you hang ten "prohibition" signs in a row, it will be useless; even if you write the two characters "prohibition" as large as "sauce shop" or "pawnshop," it will not matter. For this kind of person, it seems that the only effective way is to station an armed policeman everywhere, standing guard all day long, constantly scolding, and even slapping them when necessary. In this light, the fact that those parks can achieve practical results with the two characters "prohibition" is a phenomenon of a civilized place; and hanging "prohibition" signs can also be said to be a very civilized method. Our complaint here about the killjoy nature of this method seems to be too unforgiving of the park administrators and too extravagant of human affairs.</p>
<p>Ideals often conflict with reality, but we cannot abandon ideals because of this. It is ultimately an unpleasant thing to hang "prohibition" signs everywhere in a peaceful and beautiful country. People often say, "Art can beautify life." Here, I think of an appropriate example: according to a certain painter, the signs in a certain park replace text with cartoons and replace prohibitions with requests for sympathy, which can be said to be a clever way to reconcile ideals and reality. For example, to warn visitors not to pluck flowers and trees, there is no need to imitate military and political officials and put on a stern face and shout "prohibited." It is better to draw a beautiful cartoon, depicting a pair of hands plucking a flower, while a human head stretches out from the heart of the flower, frowning, wailing, and weeping towards the viewer. This is not only more beautiful than "prohibited," but I think it is actually more effective than prohibiting. Although flowers and trees cannot speak, humans can know that they have vitality through empathy. When a certain flower is broken, a kind of white sap immediately flows from the wound, and the leaves immediately become soft and tired. Seeing this scene, everyone feels miserable. Because this kind of sap can make people think of blood, and this kind of leaf can make people think of limbs. What the cartoon expresses is this kind of miserable scene. Asking for sympathy from people's hearts is much more effective than strong prohibitions. For example, to warn visitors not to harm the fish in the pond, the same method can be used to ask for sympathy. Draw a big fish with a bandage on its head and several cross-shaped bandages on its body, opening its mouth and shedding tears, as if it is crying out in pain. It may be helpful to draw a few small fish next to it, snuggling beside the big fish, either shedding tears of sympathy or kissing its wound with their mouths. This is a very touching cartoon. Borrowing human things (bandages) for fish is both very funny and very easy to arouse sympathy. For example, to warn visitors not to step on the grass, you can also draw a leather shoe, heavily stepping on many small grasses. Each blade of grass has a small head, shaped like a group of children in kindergarten. But these heads are trampled flat by the big leather shoes, becoming water chestnut-shaped, and everyone is crying with their mouths pursed. People are least likely to pay attention to things under their feet. But if you lie on the ground and carefully observe what happens under your feet when you walk, it is really shocking. The leather shoe is like a flying peak, many small insects are suddenly crushed to death by it, and many small grasses are suddenly cut in half. When the wound from the waist cut heals to the point of recovery, another flying peak suddenly crushes it. What a touching phenomenon this is! This painting magnifies this phenomenon and urges people to pay attention. After seeing this painting, putting your feet on the green grass seems to make your feet feel itchy and very uneasy. This is the effect of that painting.</p>
<p>The effect of this kind of painting comes from the aforementioned "emotionalization" of nature. Only when you can imagine flowers, trees, fish in the pond, and small grass as living things with the same feelings as people will you be moved by these paintings. The "emotionalized" view is based on the "compassion" in human nature. You must first be able to extend yourself to others, and then be able to empathize with things, and open the eyes of "emotionalization." Therefore, the above-mentioned cartoon signs are still ineffective for people who lack compassion. Because there are these people, most good people with full humanity innocently eat those stern warnings in the park. May 31, 1936</p>

<h3>Japan's Policy Towards China: Actively Seeking to Promote Cultural Undertakings and Economic Aggression Simultaneously</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita, taking the opportunity of Ambassador to China Kawagoe's assumption of office, will actively adjust relations with China, centering on Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Therefore, the undertakings of the Cultural Enterprise Department for China will also be promoted for a major transformation. As the first step in Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, strengthening will be promoted from the side, focusing on North China. Because the content of cultural enterprises towards China has traditionally been somewhat biased towards academic aspects such as subsidies for public and private organizations and students studying abroad and scientific research, there are doubts about the effectiveness of cultural work. Therefore, a major transformation will be made to cultural enterprises towards China to directly increase the welfare of the Chinese people economically and culturally, in order to create Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. This matter was calculated at a special parliamentary meeting, with an additional 740,000 yen added to the budget, which has been approved. Therefore, Foreign Minister Arita dispatched Dr. Saito Ryohei, who is well-versed in the situation in North China, and Mizuno, the second head of the First Section of the Research Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to China to conduct various on-the-spot investigations. The two have now returned home and will soon formulate a concrete plan based on their investigations and the report by Kuwashima, Director of the East Asia Bureau, who will return from China in early July, to be implemented from August 1. Currently under consideration are the establishment of the China Applied Science Research Institute (to be established in Qingdao or Jinan) and the Agricultural Experiment Station (Tianjin) to develop the cultivation of cotton and wheat and the raising of sheep. If this plan is successful, the benefits to China's finances and the increase in national purchasing power will not only be extremely great, but Japan can also obtain resource protection as a result, which is of great benefit.

<h3>German-Manchukuo Economic Cooperation</h3>
<p>Substantial Increase in Commodity Exchange Quantity; Manchukuo Representatives to Visit German Authorities Regularly</p>
<p>(Berlin) After Mr. Kato, a commissioner from "Manchukuo" stationed in Germany, arrived here yesterday morning, he briefly stated to our reporter, "I am disappointed that no German newspapers have mentioned my arrival at all." Then, smiling, he said, "Perhaps the newspapers want to keep my trip a secret. Before I left the country, I repeatedly met with Mr. Kroll, a member of the German Far East Research Group. Kroll is a German Foreign Ministry expert on Far East issues and a staff member of the Embassy in Japan. He is still stationed in the Far East. He participated in the negotiations when the German-Manchukuo commercial agreement was negotiated in Tokyo. I am now scheduled to visit the German Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Economics early next week. Once I find a suitable office address, I will start working so that I do not disappoint my mission. In order to develop 'Manchukuo,' we urgently need to cooperate with German industry. From the beginning of this year to the present, 'Manchukuo' has imported approximately 15 million yuan worth of German goods, while Germany has purchased 60 million yuan worth of goods from 'Manchukuo,' of which soybeans are the largest. I deeply hope that this number can soon be increased to 100 million yuan. I also hope that the economic situation of the two countries will continue to improve. This is a necessary condition for developing trade relations," he said. (27th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Kato, the first official representative of "Manchukuo" to Germany, told a Reuters reporter yesterday that "Manchukuo" is now making every effort to increase trade with Germany. Last year, the country purchased 15 million yen worth of goods from Germany, and Germany also purchased 60 million yen worth of goods from "Manchukuo," mostly soybeans, he said. Kato meant that the above figures could be greatly increased, and that Germany would soon purchase 100 million yen worth of goods from "Manchukuo," and that "Manchukuo" would also increase its purchases of German imports.

<h3>The Anti-Italian Sanctions Line Collapses; Poland First Announces Withdrawal; League of Nations Assembly Opens Tomorrow, Amendments to the Covenant Will Be Much Discussed; French Premier Arrives in Geneva to Attend in Person; Trust in the League of Nations Diminishes in the United States, Central America, and South America</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Polish Ambassador called on Italian Foreign Minister Ciano today to formally notify him that the Polish government has lifted sanctions against Italy. The Polish government's decision is to restore commercial relations with Italy immediately. Ciano thanked the Ambassador and told him to thank the Polish government, saying that Poland's move is the first country to lift sanctions. (28th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Geneva sources now expect that the League of Nations Assembly meeting on Tuesday will discuss the issue of League of Nations reform extensively. The Assembly will probably appoint a committee to study the issue and report to the next Assembly meeting in September. The main event of this Assembly will be the discussion of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. (27th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly is scheduled to meet on the afternoon of the 30th. Regarding the selection of the chairman, Australian representative Bruce and Greek representative Politis have been highly favored. It is now learned that Dutch Foreign Minister Graf and Portuguese Foreign Minister Monteiro also have hopes of being elected. (27th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Prime Minister Léon Blum arrived here from France by car with his wife at 8:00 p.m. and immediately checked into the Hôtel Bergues, where the French delegation's office is located. Crowds gathered in front of the hotel, all wanting to see his elegance. Newspaper reporters also surrounded Blum and asked him to take photos. The Prime Minister smiled and agreed, but did not make a statement on the situation, only saying that he encountered heavy rain in the second half of the trip, which made driving difficult and made him feel tired, and he wanted to rest for a while. (27th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) An Observer reporter recently claimed that Foreign Minister Eden had been authorized to propose the lifting of sanctions against Italy at the League of Nations meeting if necessary, but as far as the reporter knows, Chile of South America may be the first to propose this. (28th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Nicaragua's withdrawal from the League of Nations is seen as clear evidence of the diminishing trust in the League of Nations in South and Central America. It is now believed that Argentina and Chile's trust in the League of Nations is also wavering. At the same time, non-public discussions on the reform of the League of Nations are underway. The majority of member states clearly advocate maintaining the existing form of the League of Nations Covenant, and interpreting important provisions with some flexibility. (28th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Italian Foreign Ministry Drafting a Document to Present Legal Arguments and Persuade Sanctioning Countries to Change Course</h3>
<p>(Rome) With the League of Nations Assembly meeting imminent, Foreign Minister Ciano is now supervising his staff and is very busy drafting a document to be delivered to the member states before the opening of the Assembly. It is heard that the main points of this document are to present legal arguments to the countries participating in the sanctions, so as to make each of these countries change course and reverse what they have done before. For example, it is wrong to label Italy as an aggressor and it must be corrected. The approximate content of the document is based on the memorandum submitted by Italy to the Executive Council of the League of Nations on September 4 last year (which criticized Abyssinia) and will further explain that all member states of the League of Nations must effectively exercise political power within their borders. Since the Ethiopian government had previously failed to fulfill this obligation, it had lost its qualifications as a member state of the League of Nations. As of now, there is no government in Ethiopia, so it cannot be regarded as a member state. In Italy, it is imbuing Abyssinia with culture and engaging in pacification work, which has achieved remarkable results. Therefore, all countries should recognize Italy's annexation.

<h3>Italian Newspaper Mocks Ethiopian Delegation</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian newspaper Il Giornale d'Italia wrote today, mocking the Ethiopian delegation in Geneva, saying, "Who appointed this so-called delegation? It is said that the letter of appointment for this delegation was sent by plane from the so-called new Ethiopian government from Gore in western Abyssinia. But we should know that this government has never existed." (27th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Italy Signs Commercial Agreements with Germany and Austria Separately</h3>
<p>Improving Commercial Relations; Germany and Austria Took the Lead</p>
<p>(Rome) Count Ciano, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, recently signed commercial agreements with German Ambassador Hassel and Austrian Envoy Weidegger, respectively. According to the commercial agreements previously signed between Italy and other countries, all had been suspended since the implementation of sanctions against Italy on November 18 last year. If the sanctions are lifted in the future, these commercial agreements will have to be renegotiated. Germany and Austria, in view of this, took the lead in the middle of this month, sending representatives to conduct commercial negotiations, and the negotiations were concluded in a few days, allowing new commercial agreements to be signed with Italy.

<h3>Frequent Outside Meetings of Various National Representatives – Britain and Russia Negotiate to Eliminate Differences, Unwilling to Cause Disputes over the Straits Issue</h3>
<p>Montreux, Switzerland – Following the decision to extend the Montreux Conference, no meetings have been held for the past two days. During this time, representatives from various nations are holding informal talks in Geneva, hoping to eliminate discrepancies in opinions expressed by various countries during the conference. Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov met with British Foreign Secretary Eden this morning for discussions. It is understood that Litvinov accepted that Soviet warships could freely pass through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits only under the following special circumstances: when acting under a resolution of the League of Nations Council; when fulfilling previously accepted Soviet commitments (which should be approved by the League of Nations Council in advance); and when safeguarding the Soviet coast of the northern Black Sea. At this time, Britain is also evidently unwilling to engage in disputes with the Soviet Union over the straits issue. Following these talks, the British government will shortly issue new instructions to its chief representative, the Minister of Public Works, Lord Stanhope, so that the Montreux Conference can quickly complete its work. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Since the successive openings of the Montreux Conference and the League of Nations Council Extraordinary Meeting, representatives from various countries have been conducting informal talks separately in Geneva and Montreux. This shows that the issues discussed at these meetings are truly interconnected. What Britain seeks is, on the one hand, to confine the Soviet fleet within the Black Sea, preventing it from taking a single step beyond its boundaries, and on the other hand, to maintain stability in the Mediterranean region. Its views are quite similar to those of Italy. Regarding the threat of German rearmament, it is eager to quickly resolve the tense situation between Britain and Italy in the shortest possible time. Furthermore, it is rumored that Argentinian representative Gana will propose maintaining the territorial integrity of various nations at the League of Nations General Assembly. There are widespread rumors that Britain intends to pressure Argentina to handle the matter carefully and postpone the proposal. From the preceding news, it can be seen that the external rumors are not entirely true. However, it is said that Britain has some concerns about Argentina's proposal, as it will inevitably make it difficult for Italy to re-cooperate with the League of Nations. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Delbos lunched today with representatives from the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente. During the meal, these representatives reportedly expressed to Delbos that their respective ententes fully support the French government's stance, as stated in its recent foreign policy declaration to both houses of parliament, regarding the issue of revising the League of Nations Covenant (namely, that the Covenant need not be revised, but only annotated so as to prevent disagreements during interpretation). Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü Aras provided an account of the progress of the Montreux Conference, and stated that, following his meeting with British Foreign Secretary Eden this morning, the unique views of Turkey and Russia have come closer to the views of Britain.

<h3>British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain Defends Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>The cancellation of sanctions is to maintain peace, and views never differed with Eden</p>
<p>(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain gave a speech yesterday afternoon in Manchester, saying, "What we should do is reflect on the past and learn from it. The prestige of the League of Nations has suffered a severe blow, which is undeniable. We must now seek various ways to restore the reputation of the League of Nations, so that the situation of peace may also have a more realistic guarantee." The Chancellor then mentioned his speech at the Conservative Party club on the 10th of this month, saying, "I advocated for the cancellation of sanctions against Italy. Some have misinterpreted this, thinking that I wanted to force Foreign Secretary Eden to agree with my proposal. I cannot admit to this, because since Eden took office as Foreign Secretary, our views on foreign policy have never differed, and I have always admired the Foreign Secretary's courage and ability. I am eager to assist in the difficult tasks that the Foreign Secretary bears, and I do not want to hinder them. As for the aforementioned proposal that I made, the French authorities have also recently expressed something similar. In my opinion, their views are not much different from what I proposed." (Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3>Austen Chamberlain Resigns from the League of Nations Association</h3>
<p>Disagreement over Sanctions Issue</p>
<p>(London) Former Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain, originally a member of the League of Nations Union, has recently written to Professor Murray, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Union, to announce his resignation due to disagreements with the Union over the issue of sanctions. He stated briefly, "I really cannot agree with the Executive Committee's advocacy of maintaining sanctions. The League of Nations Covenant contains no explicit provision that sanctions should continue to be implemented as a means of punishment after the end of the war. Recent events have left the power of the Emperor of Abyssinia utterly destroyed. Even if sanctions are maintained, Abyssinia will certainly not be able to restore its independence. This is an undoubtedly fixed situation. So what is the benefit of continuing to implement sanctions?" (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) The position of Chairman of the Youth Branch of the League of Nations Union for the Central Provinces remains vacant. Foreign Secretary Eden had been expected to be a candidate. The Executive Committee of the Union recently met in Birmingham and decided to reject the Foreign Secretary's candidacy. A representative stood up and declared, "A year ago, all thoughtful young people enthusiastically supported Foreign Secretary Eden, but the Foreign Secretary's current attitude is not representative of the views held by members of this Union, which we cannot endorse."

<h3>US Democratic Party Convention Concludes – Garner Nominated as Vice Presidential Candidate, Roosevelt Declares Continued Struggle for the New Deal</h3>
<p>Philadelphia, USA – The Democratic Party National Convention officially concluded at 2:20 PM today after formally nominating Roosevelt and Garner as presidential and vice-presidential candidates. President Roosevelt delivered his acceptance speech at Franklin Square at 9:00 PM this evening, with an audience of over 100,000 people. Roosevelt said, "Having accepted your mission, I can unite with you in fighting to the end, and challenge the representatives of special classes, urging them not to cling to the Constitution and wage war." Vice President Garner also gave a brief speech, saying, "I am a soldier, and a soldier's duty is to obey the commander's orders. I accept the conditions stipulated in the party platform." During his speech, President Roosevelt compared today's economic "aristocracy" to the political aristocracy of the American Revolution, attacking them as a special class, while defending the general public, saying that these economic aristocrats are criticizing the New Deal in an attempt to overthrow the American political system. "Our purpose is to take away their power. Since we want to preserve the American political system, we must overthrow the powerful forces of these people. They hope to use the Constitution as a shield, not knowing that the Constitution represents civil liberty and not tyranny and submission. Therefore, it does not tolerate the dictatorship of mobs or special interests." Roosevelt also accepted the platform passed by the convention and solemnly declared the three main goals of this election campaign: to protect families, to alleviate the suffering of men, women, and children, and to protect the old. Roosevelt said, "The people of other countries are selling their inherent freedom in exchange for an illusion. I believe that only our success can inspire their poverty, and it is for the survival of our democratic politics, not only to save our civil government, but also to save the civil political systems of the world." (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Philadelphia – President Roosevelt delivered a rousing speech today at Franklin Square, accepting the nomination to be re-elected as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate for the next term. He did not make any surprising statements on foreign policy, but only made passionate remarks on domestic politics. Roosevelt said that the United States fully enjoys a greater life than most countries. The rapid development of the new civilization has increased many new difficulties and new problems. If we want to preserve the political and economic freedom that Presidents Washington and Jefferson fought for, these new difficulties and problems must be solved. The economic "Tories" have developed new destinies and new kingdoms in this new civilization, built on the control of major events and concentrated power. The "princes" who enjoy special rights in this new economic era are thirsty for power and have now reached a point where the government cannot control them. A small group of these people controls almost completely the property, money, labor, and lives of others. The collapse of 1929 has proven what dictatorships are. The election of 1932 was for the nation to entrust the end of this situation. Today we have a mission to the creed of freedom, which cannot be half-hearted. These economic "Tories" accuse us of trying to overthrow the American system. What these people are really complaining about is that we are trying to remove their power. The people of other countries now seem tired of engaging in the struggle to sell their inherited freedom in exchange for illusions of life, and are beginning to realize that the United States is currently waging a great war, not only to resist lack, poverty, and economic decline, but also to preserve civil governance. They are now enlisting to engage in this war. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Philadelphia, USA – At the Democratic Party National Convention this morning, Texas Governor Allred immediately proposed nominating incumbent Vice President Garner as the vice presidential candidate for the next term. He said, "Garner struggled hard from a commoner to rise to the vice presidency. He is rich in office, and his hopes are well-deserved. He also understands the sufferings of the people. President Roosevelt promoted the New Deal, bringing the people out of the water and fire and onto the mat. Garner often worked as an aide to plan for him, achieving remarkable achievements. Since you have elected President Roosevelt as the presidential candidate, then who else but Garner can be the vice presidential candidate?" (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Philadelphia – After the Democratic Party National Convention nominated President Roosevelt as the party's presidential candidate for the next term, it re-nominated incumbent Vice President Garner as the vice presidential candidate for the next term yesterday.

After the nomination, a delegation carried a life-size effigy of Garner in a procession through the convention hall. (Reuters, 28th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Actively Expanding Oil Resources</h3>
<p>Ministry of Commerce and Industry to Establish Fuel Bureau</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese military, believing that the lack of domestic oil resources has many repercussions for future wars, has been actively conducting research and management of coal liquefaction in Manchuria since the September 18th Incident. They are also planning to establish the Manchuria Oil Liquefaction Company, scheduled to be established in late next month. The company's scale is comparable to that of the German IG Farben company, with a total capital of 5 million yuan. (Hualian Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of Commerce and Industry Ogawa, in view of the Hirota Cabinet's reform policies and national defense considerations, intends to establish a comprehensive national fuel policy, which will be submitted to the cabinet on the 3rd of next month. The matter has already been instructed to the relevant authorities to quickly create a concrete plan, and on the 26th and 27th, a cooperation conference was held with the army, navy, and other provinces related to fuel, at the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. As a result of the discussions, in order to implement the national fuel policy, all advocated streamlining administrative institutions and establishing a powerful implementation agency. It is now planned to expand the Fuel Section of the Mining Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry into a Fuel Bureau. The Army Investigation Bureau and Finance Minister Bamba also believe that the establishment is necessary, so it must be realized during the budget deliberation for the next fiscal year. It is understood that the fuel bureau plan currently being prepared is as follows:</p>
<p>The Fuel Section of the Mining Bureau will be renamed the Fuel Bureau; The Fuel Bureau will manage coal gas, coal, fuel oil, and its substitute fuels (such as coal liquefaction and gasoline-synthetic alcohol, etc.), including the administration of developing domestic and foreign resources; Organization: (A) The Fuel Bureau will be run by a director system; (B) A participation system will be established by officials from relevant provinces and those with knowledge and experience in this field, and will serve as the highest deliberation body for the national fuel strategy, etc. (Hualian Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Expansion of Armaments Rationale</h3>
<p>Admiral Nagano Will Explain in Budget Cabinet Meeting</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan's new naval budget for the next fiscal year is currently being accelerated. The most important program is the cost of expanding armaments. It is said that Navy Minister Nagano will point out the following reasons at the budget cabinet meeting at the beginning of next month, explaining the necessity of expanding naval armaments: If Japan does not expand its navy in time, it will become 60% of the US's armaments in three or four years, facing major dangers; Recently, not only the United Kingdom and the United States, but also the Soviet Union are vigorously expanding their navies, so Japan must strengthen its naval strength for self-defense; It is also necessary to expand armaments to protect foreign development and consolidate the foundation of the national economy; Preventing the ambitions of other countries and defending the country from foreign insults cannot be achieved without armaments.

<h3>Japan Plans to Expand Overseas Broadcasting</h3>
<p>Using English, German, French, and Japanese to Conduct Extensive Propaganda to the World</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The AK overseas broadcasting, which began in June last year, has achieved unexpectedly good results. When the February 26th Incident occurred, American newspapers repeatedly made malicious propaganda. Fortunately, this overseas broadcasting allowed overseas Chinese to learn the truth and be reassured. The overseas embassies also used this broadcasting to contact the country, which shows that the effect is very significant. The Broadcasting Association, based on the valuable experience of this year, has decided to broadcast to the world. As a result of consultations with the International Telephone Company, it was decided to allocate a budget of 700,000 yuan to install the world's only overseas broadcasting-specific transmitter of 50 kilowatts at the company's Nagasaki transmission station. It can be completed in November. At the same time, the broadcasting time will be extended from the current one hour to four hours, divided into four areas: Hawaii, the US West Coast; The US East Coast; European countries; and the Nanyang, Java, and India regions. News, music, lectures, etc., will be broadcast to the above-mentioned locations in English, Japanese, German and French for one hour each day. The Broadcasting Association plans to budget 500,000 yuan each year. Once this dedicated transmitter is installed, all Japanese living around the world will be able to sit and listen to events in their homeland. (Toa Allied Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Military Service System</h3>
<p>Hualian News Agency Special Article The Soviet Union's military service system was initially a volunteer system. In April 1918, it was changed to a compulsory military service system. In 1922, it was established as a conscription system in accordance with the law. To this day, the age limit for people to serve is from nineteen to forty years old. The first two years from the age of nineteen are for preparatory education. Each year, they must receive preparatory education for one month at a training center in their place of residence. From the age of twenty, for five years, they are active-duty soldiers. Afterwards, they are divided into six categories according to their physical condition, education level, political awareness, and other conditions: unconditionally qualified persons; suitable for frontline war service; suitable for non-frontline war service; suitable for military production service; temporarily unqualified persons due to illness or poor education (deferred); and unconditionally unqualified persons, exempt from military service. Qualified service members are immediately assigned to the regular army, militia, military production service teams, and out-of-school education units.</p>
<p>Regular Army: Same as other countries, its members are all excellent individuals. The length of service is two years for the army, three to four years for the navy, and three years for the air force.</p>
<p>Militia: Divided into core units and alternating units. The former is the same as the regular army, and the latter is stipulated to receive training in each assembly area for a certain period of time (eight to eleven months during the five-year active service period). The characteristic of the militia is that it is formed based on the residence of the militiamen. It emphasizes field training, so its ability is also very strong.</p>
<p>Out-of-Corps Active Duty: This is a system that is not incorporated into the regular army or the militia. It is divided into military production and military education. The service period for military production is set at two years. During the service period, they receive military education determined by the People's Committee of National Defense. In the remaining three years, they must undergo temporary conscription for a total of three months within one month each year. The education section must undergo six months of conscription for military education in five years.</p>
<p>Reserves: After receiving active-duty training, they are incorporated into the reserves, with an age range from twenty-six to forty years old. As for non-laborers, unqualified persons, and criminals, they are treated as rear national forces and ordered to compulsory work for public welfare undertakings for up to three years, or a special household tax is levied between the ages of twenty and forty. In addition, there is also the following military education for civilians: Preparatory Education: Youths aged nineteen to twenty should receive preparatory education from the National Defense Aviation and Chemical Association. The association is the largest civilian military education organization. The fundamental task is to enable the broad masses of working people to voluntarily participate in national defense preparations. There are military knowledge research associations and military lecture meetings, and military training is conducted, providing various educations such as infantry, artillery, machine gun teams, communications teams, tank teams, and aviation teams. It has also completed great achievements in the departments of mass marching, field training, camping, participation in military exercises, shooting, various sports, equestrianism, flying, safety parachutes, clubs, and the establishment of aviation and chemical museums, military science research institutes, the issuance of military popularization documents, and national defense fundraising campaigns. There are currently 2.8 million members, who will become the most important source of the Red Army in times of war. School Military Education: In elementary schools, military education in the seventh grade is a required subject. In secondary schools, a certain amount of military education is implemented as pre-conscription preparation education. In universities, it is treated as higher out-of-corps soldier education, subject to the application of conscription. In the entire semester, they must receive 430-580 hours of on-campus education, and three to four months of conscription training in the army. Military Education for Teenagers and Women: Women are not forced to serve in the military, but they can participate in military service according to their own wishes. Currently, there are many female officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers in the Red Army. For teenagers, the Young Pioneers are given a certain degree of military education. Finally, there is the Sevosto system, which serves as a military-civilian cooperation agency. This is a system where factories, collective farms, or public group trade unions, etc., support a certain regiment or fleet, that is, a support system. They handle tasks such as urging visits, providing gifts, providing technical assistance, and improving weapons for various supported troops.</p>
<h3>French Labor Unrest Resurges</h3>
<p>30,000 Workers Strike in the Lorraine Heavy Industry, Water and Electricity Supplies Cut Off in Aubenas</p>
<p>(Paris) New labor unrest is erupting daily across the country. The most serious incident occurred yesterday when 30,000 workers in the Lorraine heavy industry announced a general strike. This was due to employers' failure to honor a recently agreed-upon contract in Paris. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Water and electricity supplies were cut off today in Aubenas, the capital of the Ardèche department. Strike advocates have persuaded workers managing public utilities there to cease work. In the Mans region, 25,000 metallurgical workers have also begun striking, demanding wage increases. (Guomin News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The current wave of strikes is affecting all industries. Some businesses are experiencing significant financial difficulties, and there is concern that debts due at the end of this month may not be met. The Governor of the Bank of France, Labeyrie, has recently written to Lehideux, the president of the Banking Association, regarding this matter. He requested that Lehideux inform all member banks to exercise caution when recalling loans and to grant leniency to those facing financial difficulties due to the impact of the strikes, allowing them to postpone repayment. As for the banks themselves, if they experience difficulties, "the Bank of France will naturally adopt rediscounting methods as much as possible, so that private banks can provide temporary convenience to agriculture, industry, and commerce. This I can guarantee," he stated. The National Retailers Federation has issued a statement expressing gratitude for Labeyrie's decision. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Dim Streetlights in Metz</h3>
<p>Metz City: Workers at the city's gas plant have recently announced a strike. Streetlights in the city will soon be impossible to light, and housewives will also find it difficult to cook food. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Nice Hotels Close</h3>
<p>Nice City: The local hotel managers' association, citing poor business conditions, has decided to close all establishments. All 450 hotels in the city ceased operations at noon today. However, one hotel in each of the upper, middle, and lower classes will remain open as usual. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3>National Bank Seeks to Aid Various Industries Financially</h3>
<p>(Paris) Labor unrest across the country is nearing complete resolution, but the situation with the dockworkers' strike in Saint-Nazaire remains serious. Rumors circulated yesterday that a conflict had occurred there, resulting in the death of one worker, but authorities have denied this. Since the resumption of work by sailors in Marseille, everything has returned to normal. Ships are departing and arriving as usual, without any obstacles. Yesterday, five French postal ships departed for Corsica, Algeria in North Africa, and Morocco. Foreign postal ships arriving in the area are also anchoring in the harbor as usual. A grand champagne race is scheduled to be held today in the capital. The 1,000 employees of the racetrack who had announced a strike yesterday have returned to work after mediation by the Minister of Labor, Lemaire. (Havas, 28th)</p>

<p>(London) Sir Miles Lampson, the British High Commissioner to Egypt, flew back to Cairo from Southampton today. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>Palestine Situation Deteriorates</h3>
<p>Arab Higher Committee Issues Strong Declaration</p>
<p>Jerusalem: The Arab Higher Committee has issued a declaration stating, "Unless the British government effectively stops Jewish immigration to Palestine, and unless the Arab people can organize a national government, the situation will never return to normal." Furthermore, the Zionist Organization has also issued a declaration, stating, "Palestine has fallen into a state of anarchy due to the British government's lack of a clear policy. This is tantamount to encouraging Arab rioters. However, in fairness, the government has also made some achievements, most notably by continuing to issue entry permits to Jews requesting entry. This action is sufficient to inform the Arab people that the British government will not yield to violent actions." (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: Rumors circulating outside suggest that 60,000 armed Bedouins are preparing to enter Palestine to assist Arabs in attacking Jews. British authorities here today have declared this to be completely unfounded. The British Public Security Director of Transjordan, Peake, reported that the total number of armed men in the entire region does not even reach 60,000. (Guomin News Agency, 27th)</p>
<h3>Polish Monetary Policy: Exchange Freedom Maintains Stability</h3>
<p>(Warsaw) In the past ten years, Poland's monetary policy has been based entirely on two major principles: first, maintaining the stability of the złoty; and second, freedom of exchange. Since the Polish government made efforts to achieve budget balance last autumn, the financial situation in Poland has gradually improved. Unfortunately, due to the instability of the European economic situation, a large amount of Polish currency has flowed out, with some buying currency to store in the country and others storing it abroad. Because the Polish government has not addressed this hoarding of currency, the large outflow of currency has affected the reserve amount of the Polish bank, and the Polish government's policy of improving the financial situation has also been greatly affected. In order to prevent the continued development of this situation, the government has no choice but to adopt policies that restrict the export of currency and control exchange. The biggest purpose of the Polish government's policy of restricting currency exports and controlling exchange is to protect the value of the Polish currency and prevent its devaluation. After the implementation of the new policy, those directly affected are those engaged in investment and hoarding. It will no longer be possible to continue hindering the proper development of finance and commerce. However, the Polish government will continue to repay all foreign debts as before, and the 7% stabilization bonds issued in 1927 will also be repaid in gold. The new monetary regulations will not affect any current or future legal commercial contracts. All sales contracts for the supply of industrial raw materials or machinery are absolutely unrestricted. Before starting to implement the policy of controlling foreign exchange, the Polish government first declared that the purpose of the government in adopting this policy was to prevent speculation and protect the economic livelihood of the Polish people, and stated that after the implementation of this new policy, the government's budget balance and stable monetary policy could be successful.</p>
<h3>Tasmanian Centennial Exhibition: Robot Defends Itself, Speaks on Behalf of the Department of Labor</h3>
<p>Washington News: The Centennial Exposition in Taxas, Tasmania, is about to open. The U.S. Government Department of Labor has specially made a robot to display at the meeting. The robot can speak on behalf of the Department of Labor. The sentences have been determined. At the time, the machine will bow to the public first, make ordinary polite remarks, saying, "How are you, friends?" Then continue saying, "I am a robot, made by hand to represent modern industrial machines. Many people do not like me. They say that I do things that people used to do by hand. They say I am the cause of unemployment. They call this unemployment technical unemployment, because I am a product of science or technology. In some occupations, I have replaced manual labor. This is true. Here (at this time the robot turns its right arm) are some pictures showing why I am often feared. I admit that for a period of time, in every place, my appearance has temporarily taken away the jobs of many people. In fact, there are many thousands of jobs. However, despite this evidence, I am still a true benefactor of mankind. Almost every time I appear in industry, I certainly create more jobs for men and women, providing more occupations." The robot's voice is very similar to the New York dialect, not Southern or Western. (World News Agency)</p>

<h3>Second Lecture on the Life Course: How to Study Biology in the Future (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xue Deyu</p>
<p>Biology differs from other sciences in that it is regional. Moreover, China has a vast territory, abundant resources, and numerous biological species that have not yet been thoroughly investigated. The opportunities to discover new species and new facts through research from various perspectives are greater than in other sciences. Therefore, pure biology should not be neglected. Furthermore, the customs statistics on foreign trade released in January show that the main import goods are cotton and cotton textiles, wool and wool textiles, foreign rice, wheat, marine fish and shellfish products, timber, and paper. The main export goods are tung oil, hog bristles, beans, bran, sesame, tea, silk, tobacco leaves, egg and egg products, raw and processed hides and leather goods, and cottonseed oil. Moreover, there is a trade surplus of nine million yuan. Stimulated by this report, biologists who previously disdained applied research and only talked about theory have also become somewhat aware. From this perspective, pure biology and applied biology should complement each other in our country and should not be neglected.</p>
<p>Cultivating Research Abilities: The previous methods of teaching biology largely focused on understanding, memorization, and the application of principles. I believe that this is a teaching method that teachers hope will result in good grades for students on exams. It is absolutely impossible to judge students' research abilities through this. In the future, the teaching of biology should cultivate a practical research ability for researching new materials. The so-called research ability cannot be fully explained in one sentence. It roughly includes the following points:</p>
<p>1.  Ability to discover research topics...Questions</p>
<p>2.  Ability to focus on the key points of research...Hypotheses</p>
<p>3.  Ability to design appropriate methods...Planning</p>
<p>(A) Ability to collect materials (B) Ability to observe and experiment (C) Ability to distinguish and compare (D) Reasoning ability (E) Induction ability} ...Implementation</p>
<p>4. Ability to summarize and publish research results...Criticism of the above questions, hypotheses, plans, and implementation, etc., I believe is the most important goal in research training. This ability can be called research ability.</p>
<p>Previously, the method of studying biology in schools was "the teacher teaches, the students believe." Specimens, instruments, and experiments only supplemented what the teacher said and proved that what the student was taught was not wrong. All the answers only used the student's mouth to answer what the teacher had already predicted. This attitude toward research can never cultivate students' original research abilities. Because research must start with questions. Watt invented the steam engine, and Newton discovered the Earth's gravity because they were able to question what ordinary people do not question. Originally, humans have two natures: one is "skepticism" and the other is "credulity." For example, when a child first hears thunder, if told that "the Thunder God will hit people," he will be afraid of the Thunder God hitting him whenever he hears thunder again. If he is told that "thunder is the sound of two electric charges touching each other," he will not be afraid of thunder. Therefore, those who guide research need to distinguish clearly and make them doubt what they should doubt and believe what they should believe. If they are forced to doubt where they should not doubt, then the nerve center that controls doubt will degenerate, and they will become general blind followers and superstitious people. There will be no hope for development in terms of learning. Because to hope for the development of a subject, one must rely on original research. To have original research, one must usually cultivate original research abilities.</p>
<p>The motive for research lies in questions, and emphasis should be placed on the four words: What, How, Why, For What?</p>
<p>What? The question of "What is this?" in biology belongs to questions of a classifying nature. For example, when referring to "trees" and "insects," saying "What kind of tree is this?" or "What kind of insect is this?" contains the meaning of requiring clarity of classification.</p>
<p>How? The question of "How?" in biology belongs to questions of a morphological (anatomical) nature. For example, "What do the flowers of this kind of tree look like?" or "What is the internal structure of this insect like?" contains the meaning of requiring clarity of its morphology and structure.</p>
<p>Why? The question of "Why?" in biology belongs to questions of a physiological nature. For example, "Why do the leaves of a tree turn red?" or "Why can a cicada chirp?" contains the meaning of requiring clarity of its physiological functions.</p>
<p>For What? The question of "For What?" in biology belongs to questions of an ecological nature. For example, "Why do the leaves of a tree turn red?" contains the meaning of requiring clarity of its ecological significance.</p>
<p>With the above four questions, one can study taxonomy, morphology, physiology, and ecology. I will give another practical example to demonstrate. For example, if you see a "bee" flying among flowers and have a question, how should you start researching this question? First, you must assume that the bee flying among the flowers must have some kind of relationship with the flowers. Go to the flowers to collect bees and flowers and observe them. If observation is not enough, then experiment. Compare and speculate on the facts obtained. Then summarize and determine that the bee flying among the flowers is sucking the honey between the flowers, and indirectly can also mediate pollen. This conclusion can be regarded as a new discovery, and it is okay to publish it for everyone to criticize.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Biology, which is most closely related to human life and is also regional, should pay attention to cultivating a practical research ability for researching new materials in the future. Only with this ability will there be new inventions, discoveries, and special contributions. At the same time, theory and application must be advanced in both directions and cannot be neglected.

<h3>Fujian Province Recruits Zhang Xiongnan's Faction</h3>
<p>No Troop Increase on the Fujian-Guangdong Border</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Since the Guangdong army entered Hunan via Guilin, rumors have arisen in Fujian Province, which borders the Chaoshan region of Guangdong Province. However, as of recently, the Fujian-Guangdong border remains as peaceful as usual. Although the number of Guangdong troops at the Jiaoling-Wufeng border in Guangdong has increased to two regiments in the past week, and the number at the Yongding-Dabu border has increased to three regiments, the Guangdong troops stationed along the Fujian border in Jiaoling, Meixian, Dabu, and Raoping counties still consist of only the First Brigade (Yan Yingyu) and the Second Brigade (Zeng Youren) of Huang Renhuan's Independent First Division, with a total of six regiments. There has been no troop increase, and there has been no concentration of troops on the border, nor has there been any entry of Guangdong troops into Fujian. As for the Guangdong troops bordering Huanggang in Fujian, they were all transferred away on the 20th. The next day, another 50 to 60 people from the Guangdong Guard Brigade headquarters arrived in Huanggang to take over the defense, because the Guard Brigade (Chen Guanghan) stationed in Dongjiang recently transferred to Chaoshan to increase defenses, and the Fifth Tax Police Regiment took over the defense of Dongjiang.</p>
<p>The Central Army of Fujian Province is currently conducting a campaign to suppress the remnants of Zhang Dingcheng, Zhang Changshui, and other factions in Xilongyong in western Fujian and Jinghepu in Zhangzhou, and has not increased troops on the Guangdong border. Therefore, at present, southern Fujian and western Fujian have not been significantly affected. In terms of the civilian army, although there are some disappointed leaders such as Zhang Xiongnan, Ye Songsheng, Hong Wende, Ye Zuyi, and Lü Weisheng active in Hong Kong, they are following the old 19th Route Army line, which is the so-called "Great Alliance of the Chinese National Revolution." The host is Weng Zhaoyuan. Among them, except for Zhang Xiongnan, none of them have real strength, and they are just buying empty and selling empty. As for Zhang Xiongnan's faction, that is, Zhang Kewu, Zhang Chengfu, and other factions who are currently fleeing to Daxian Taiyong, they have more than a thousand people. On the night of the 18th of this month, they captured Datian County, and on the night of the 21st, they fled back to Zhuyang in Yongtai. The Security Office has now sent Councilor Zhu from the Provincial Government to Dehua to recruit them. Zhu ordered Ke Jiefu, Zhang Xiongnan's former chief of staff, to contact them. The two Zhangs expressed their willingness to surrender and be incorporated. Zhu ordered Zhang's troops to concentrate in Shantou and Jitouyang, pending the dispatch of personnel from the Provincial Government for inventory and incorporation. If the recruitment of the two Zhangs is successful, the civilian army problem will be largely resolved. As for Guo Zong's faction in Anxi, it has been eliminated. Lü Zhenshan has 700 to 800 people and is currently fleeing to Yangbian, and there is also news of recruitment. In Zhangzhou, there is Xie Zaifa of the Great Alliance, who colludes with the communist bandits Zhang Dingcheng and Zhang Changshui. Others are just small clowns and cannot do anything.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Expands the Scope of Anti-Smuggling</h3>
<p>The Province is Divided into Five Regions and Twelve Offices, with a Monthly Increase in Expenses of More Than 40,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Qu Fangpu, the Director of Finance of Guangdong Province, recently, in order to promote anti-smuggling work, in order to enrich tax revenue and unify the anti-smuggling power of the entire province, has specially ordered the General Office of Anti-Smuggling on Water and Land of the whole province to be responsible for handling it. Recently, the General Office of Anti-Smuggling has been ordered to formulate a unified anti-smuggling plan, and at the same time, it plans to divide the southeast area into five regions to handle anti-smuggling affairs: Chao Mei, Dongjiang, Zhongshun Liangyang, Wuyi Xijiang, and Nanlu Qiongya. Each region will set up an anti-smuggling office, and select areas to set up twelve anti-smuggling districts and forty anti-smuggling posts, in order to increase anti-smuggling strength. As for the expansion of the anti-smuggling team and the increase of inspectors, efforts are also being made. However, due to limited funds, since the expansion of the anti-smuggling scope, the deficit has been very large. The provincial authorities have specially approved an increase in expenses of more than 48,000 yuan per month in order to quickly complete the unified anti-smuggling plan.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Department of Finance Borrows from Syndicate</h3>
<p>Using Ding Type Public Bonds as Collateral to Borrow 4 Million, the Agreement Can Be Signed on July 1st</p>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Zhejiang Province's finances have been in deficit for many years, and the province's debt has reached as high as 60 million yuan. From the 25th year onward, debt expenses will account for more than half of the province's budget. Cheng Yuanfan, the Director of Finance, in order to solve the financial difficulties, (specially issued a 60 million yuan reorganization public bond from May 16th to reorganize the old bonds, reduce interest, and extend the repayment period, and this year is about to end, and the fees owed by various agencies and the transfer fees at the beginning of the 25th year have to be found ways to raise, and specially allocated 8 million yuan of Ding Type public bonds to Shanghai to negotiate with the China, Communications, and Zhejiang Local banks to borrow 4 million, the result was satisfactory. As for the borrowing methods, the authorities were invited to Hangzhou on the 24th to hold a meeting with the authorities of various banks to discuss and decide. The contract is currently being drafted by the Department of Finance and sent to the Central Communications Local Three Banks to go through the procedures of requesting instructions from the head office. On July 1st, it will be formally signed. The content of the contract will be based on the agreed principle of repaying in six years, with an annual interest rate of 10%, and repaying on schedule. The repayment method in the first three years of the six years will be to pay 560,000 yuan of interest on the 8 million yuan of Ding Type public bonds annually, and at the same time, extract the principal once. From the fourth year onwards, in addition to paying the principal and interest according to the previous method, an additional 300,000 yuan in cash will be allocated in two installments to repay the principal. In the sixth year, the entire amount will be repaid. After the Department of Finance has borrowed the signature, it will pay half of it to the bank immediately, which is 2 million yuan, to pay 1 million for the accumulated political expenses and 1 million for construction projects and to make up for the deficit at the end of the year. The remaining 2 million yuan will still be deposited in the bank and used in installments. At present, due to the urgent need, 150,000 yuan has been prepaid to the local bank to help with the urgent situation. There is still 1.85 million yuan that will be remitted soon. It is heard that after the authorities have carried out a major reorganization and major borrowing this year, if there are no unexpected major expenditures in the financial sector, it will not be reduced to a poor situation again.

<h3>Shandong Provincial Government Banning Women's Foot Binding</h3>
<p>Men Are Not Allowed to Marry Women with Bound Feet, and Regulations on Men's and Women's Clothing Are Formulated and Implemented</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The banning of women's foot binding in this province has long been carried out vigorously. Various counties have also organized foot release associations to carry out persuasion and advocacy in the countryside. However, ordinary ignorant people are addicted to accumulated habits and do not repent themselves, so the results have been very poor in recent years. Recently, the provincial government formulated an effective method and notified the counties to comply with it. The most effective point is that men are not allowed to marry women with bound feet under the age of 20, and violators will be sentenced to detention for less than two months or a fine of less than 200 yuan. The only reason why women have been binding their feet throughout history is to make it easier to marry and to gain the love and affection of their husbands. Now that this new method has been implemented, all unmarried men are no longer allowed to marry women with bound feet, so the original intention of women's foot binding is lost. The trend of foot binding can be greatly reduced. In addition, the provincial government has designated measures to ban bizarre clothing, stipulating that men's and women's clothing should be neat and simple, and should not be involved in bizarre customs. The above two methods were approved by the provincial government's administrative meeting on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Special Commissioner Ge Tan of Nantong District Inspects the Salt Reclamation in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>And States Opinions on Developing the Reclamation Area</p>
<p>Nantong Correspondence: Special Commissioner Ge Tan of the Nantong District returned to Nantong after inspecting the salt reclamation area in Northern Jiangsu and specially reported to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, stating that since the Commissioner was ordered to govern Nantong District, he has paid attention to the investigation of social economy and how to promote problems. Since the district is richest in cotton production and the textile industry is also very developed, it is confirmed that improving and developing the cotton industry is the most important task. After months of research, it is believed that to develop the cotton industry, large-scale reclamation must be carried out, and a unified approach should be taken to develop water conservancy, improve soil, prevent pests, and manage production and sales. However, such work requires huge capital. In recent years, various undertakings in the district have been sluggish, and it is not easy to raise funds. Even the financial resources of the province are difficult to fully support. Therefore, bank investment is the only way. Secondly, specialized technology is needed. All issues related to water conservancy, soil, pests, seed production, and sales need to be researched and contributed by experts. In order to realize the plan, the Commissioner has repeatedly consulted with the industrial and financial circles in Shanghai, and they have all expressed their approval. It has been decided to jointly organize a salt reclamation economic inspection team with major banks, business companies, and the Cotton Industry Control Committee in Shanghai, and invite various experts to conduct on-site inspections as a reference and preparation for development. The inspection process, impressions, and opinions are presented in sections as follows:</p>
<p>Inspection Process</p>
<p>The inspection team consisted of 42 people, including representatives from the provincial government, the Cotton Industry Control Committee, representatives from major banks in Shanghai, representatives from various reclamation companies, professors of agricultural science from Nantong Academy, and technicians and businessmen. They gathered in Nantong on June 11th. The next day, they visited Nantong Academy's Department of Agriculture, Department of Textiles, Dasheng Yarn Factory, and power plant. On the 13th, they arrived in Dongtai via Rugao and Haian, inspected the reclamation area of Cangguan Dafeng Salt Reclamation Company, the Xiaming Sluice built by the National Economic Council, Hailonggang in Haimen, and arrived in Yancheng County, where they visited the reclamation area of Taihe Salt Reclamation Company. On the 14th, they visited the Dongtai Cotton Planting Guidance Center of the Central Cotton Production Improvement Institute and the Wanggang Sluice built by the Construction Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, followed by visits to the reclamation areas of Yuhua Reclamation and Colonization Company and Shangji Reclamation Group. On the 15th, they arrived in Funing County and visited the reclamation area of Huacheng Salt Reclamation Company. On the 16th, they visited the reclamation area of the University Foundation Department of Nantong College and the Funing Cotton Planting Guidance Center of the Central Cotton Production Improvement Institute, Hede Reclamation and Colonization Company, and Dagang Reclamation Company. On the 18th, they returned to Nantong. On the 19th, they visited Dayou Jin Salt Reclamation Company and Dayu Salt Reclamation Company. All members of the inspection team were able to conduct practical research based on their expertise, and they persisted tirelessly despite the heat. Their spirit was excellent.</p>
<p>Impressions</p>
<p>The following is a summary of the impressions and thoughts gained from the inspection: The persons in charge of the reclamation companies are all brave in serving. After years of failure, their spirit has not diminished. They are able to have a deeper understanding of the reclamation industry. The reclaimed land along the coast has gradually been developed, and cotton is being produced. Local and foreign farmers have also come to settle down and engage in new farming. The land price and tenancy rent in various districts have increased compared to before. The government authorities have also paid attention to this, dredging rivers and building sluices without sparing any effort. The province's dredging of the new Grand Canal is about to start surveying and construction soon. Under the consistent promotion of reclamation industry by all parties, the prospects are infinitely promising.</p>
<p>Dredging Water Conservancy</p>
<p>Water conservancy occupies the most important position in the reclamation industry. Agricultural irrigation depends on it. In addition to drainage and water diversion, to achieve the purpose of water storage and water exchange, sluices should be built first. The Xiaming Sluice, Wanggang Sluice, and Zhugang Sluice have been completed one after another. The rivers and ditches in various districts have gradually been dredged, which is gratifying. However, after the sluices are built, they must be dredged and maintained at any time, and attention should be paid to opening and closing them. Xinyang Port and Sheyang River have a large amount of reclaimed land, and sluices should be built as soon as possible to regulate the water. In the future, after the new Grand Canal is dredged, more east-west and north-south tributary rivers should be dredged to facilitate irrigation.</p>
<p>Improving Soil</p>
<p>In the coastal reclamation area, there used to be many salt-making stove sites. It is difficult to cultivate hundreds of miles of barren land. It takes time to turn wasteland into arable land. Improving soil properties is an important task in the salt reclamation area. If capital and labor can be used, it will not be difficult to turn barren land into fertile soil. If it is not improved and left to nature, the alkaline air will rise, and red algae will cover the ground. Arable land will return to uncultivated land. It can be seen that engineering projects such as desalting, storing fresh water, planting green manure, and underground drainage are indispensable. Farmers' financial resources must be supported. This is the lifeline of the reclamation area and cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Pest Control</p>
<p>The biggest enemy of cotton fields is pests. Pests in the reclamation area are more severe than in other farmland. This is because the crops in the entire area are mostly cotton. The soil has not been fully improved and crop rotation cannot be implemented. Therefore, pests breed very quickly and are difficult to eradicate. Farmers in all the districts visited said that during the germination period, the cotton seedlings are eaten by small cutworms, or during the maturation period, the cotton bolls are eaten by bollworms. Therefore, attention should be paid to prevention and control. After the soil has been desalinated, stored with fresh water, and drained underground, crop rotation can be implemented to eliminate pests. Medicines can also be used to eliminate pests at any time. If prevention and control are effective, not only can disasters be avoided, but also the yield can be greatly increased.</p>
<p>Improving Cotton Seeds</p>
<p>After years of research, the use of Jinzi cotton seeds has become more widespread in the reclamation area, and the trial results are also good, which has gained the trust of farmers. However, this work is of utmost importance and cannot be effective without close cooperation with research institutions. In the future, attention should be paid to: 1. Continuing to test and promote more suitable improved varieties. 2. Paying attention to breeding. Due to the relationship between soil quality and climate in the entire reclamation area, seeds should be replaced every three to five years. The entire area needs a 50,000-mu breeding farm to supply cotton seeds to the entire area. 3. Maintaining pure seeds. The cotton seed unified reclamation system should be adopted to ban farmers and flower merchants from freely ginning cotton. The government control agency should set up ginning and baling factories in the reclamation area, select cotton seeds during ginning, retain the pure seeds and remove the inferior ones. In addition to selling the inferior seeds to oil factories, the pure seeds are distributed to farmers for planting.</p>
<p>Researching Cultivation</p>
<p>In the reclamation area, the yield of seed cotton per mu in 1935 was as low as less than 20 jin and as high as 150 jin, which is a huge difference. This depends on whether attention is paid to cultivation. The reason why farmers cannot actively cultivate is mostly due to economic constraints. Therefore, government agencies or financial groups should lead farmers to organize cooperatives and provide them with production loans to make up for their economic shortcomings. As for the improvement of cultivation techniques, research institutions can provide guidance to achieve considerable results and reach standard yields.</p>
<p>Protecting Public Security</p>
<p>Regarding the security of the reclamation area, each district has a business security team stationed in the area to take charge of public security. However, in 1930 and 1931, pirates landed and occupied the area for more than a month. Farmers suffered from looting and their properties were lost. The losses in the entire district were significant. Currently, the original business security teams of various companies have insufficient security forces. In addition, transportation is inconvenient, it takes time to travel back and forth, and the area is vast, making it difficult to coordinate. For the sake of farmers' peace and happiness, administrative agencies should concentrate their forces, plan in a unified way, and ensure the safety of the reclamation area.</p>
<p>Popularizing Education</p>
<p>Most companies in the reclamation area have established primary schools, but farm households are scattered in various places, and farm children have to travel more than ten miles to school, which is inconvenient. It is inevitable that they regard schooling as a difficult path. Few farmers in the area are literate. Dafeng Company has not only established agricultural reclamation training classes to train talents engaged in reclamation, but also cooperated with the provincial government to run teacher training classes to prepare for the popularization of education. The intention is very good. In the future, compulsory education and farmer supplementary education in the reclamation area should be given equal attention. More primary schools should be added in each district and gradually expanded to achieve the goal of compulsory education. At the same time, supplementary education and literacy education should be given to out-of-school adults. Popular lectures should be used to promote proper entertainment, correct farmers' bad habits, and guide farmers' correct thinking. This is the basic work for improving the lives of farmers in the reclamation area and should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Relieving Tenants</p>
<p>In the reclamation area, such as Dafeng and Hede, there are many tenants, with more than 10,000 in each district. Many of them are heavily indebted and extremely poor. In order to avoid the difficulties of tenants in the future, or extreme rent collection, and various disputes between landlords and tenants, cooperatives should fully subsidize the economic strength of tenants. Research institutions should guide tenants with farming techniques to increase farmers' production and enrich their income, so that both landlords and tenants can benefit. The fair value of land should be considered and the land in the area should be sold to farmers in installments, so that tenants can live and work in peace, labor and cultivate all year round, and not lose their hope, so as to achieve Dr. Sun Yat-sen's goal of "land to the tiller."</p>
<p>Subsidizing Poor Farmers</p>
<p>The economic situation of farmers in the reclamation area is not satisfactory based on the inspection. Farmers with sufficient economic strength have suitable soil cultivation and abundant harvests. They cultivate more mu of land and make huge profits and have more savings. Most of the farmers in the area are from Haimen and Qidong counties. They are brave in developing and have a spirit of enterprise. They often accumulate savings and develop new land elsewhere, some successfully, some failing. However, those who have no fixed residence and leave their land uncultivated should be punished. The general small farmers and poor farmers cannot cultivate more mu of land, and they do not have the ability to cultivate the land. Their output is small, and they have many mouths to feed. Their plight is extremely pitiful. The government should guide rich farmers in a cooperative manner to develop savings habits and help poor farmers with farming capital. If the economic situation of farmers improves day by day, the reclamation work will be easier to start.</p>
<p>Development Opinions</p>
<p>Based on the inspection and impressions of the team members, it is believed that the reclamation work is very promising. However, in the past, administrative agencies rarely supervised, guided, and contacted, and lacked impetus, so it was difficult to achieve the effectiveness of control. In order to concentrate manpower and financial resources to promote the reclamation work, a specialized agency should be established in the reclamation area, directly under the provincial government, and granted rights to seek control of the work in the reclamation area. The inspection team believes that there are three things that need to be organized and established urgently: 1. Organize and establish the Huainan Reclamation Management Committee. 2. Establish the Jiangbei Reclamation Area Cotton Production Improvement Office. 3. Establish the Reclamation Area Construction Loan Syndicate. In addition, there are two transportation projects in the reclamation area that need to be improved urgently: 1. The highway should be completed quickly before the New Grand Canal is constructed. 2. Telephones should be installed as soon as possible to facilitate communication.</p>
<p>This team's inspection was in a short time, and it did not visit the entire area, so omissions are inevitable. However, the important points have been seen. In addition, all team members were able to concentrate and use an objective attitude to discuss various issues, so the results obtained are satisfactory. The above are just general ideas. In the future, a detailed report will be compiled, a plan will be formulated, and a separate report will be submitted for approval and implementation. If it is adopted and can be implemented step by step, it will be a great blessing for the reclamation area.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Prepares to Train Jia Chiefs</h3>
<p>The village and town Bao chiefs in this county have all been summoned for training last year, but the training of Jia chiefs has not yet been held. However, the Jia chief is the foundation of self-government. If Baojia is to be promoted and the organization is to be flexible, Jia chiefs must be trained. The county government has formulated a training plan and the districts are preparing. However, there are many Jia chiefs, so there is a method of centralized training by district. Yesterday, the county government convened a meeting again. The limit is two weeks. The opening ceremony will be held at the county government at 8:00 am on the 3rd. Each village and town in each district will send representatives of the Jia chiefs to participate. The training time is from 5:30 am to 8:30 am every day. There are a total of 154 training venues in the county. The qualifications for Jia chiefs to be exempted from training will be handled according to the example of Bao chiefs being exempted from training. Those who evade and do not attend will be fined in accordance with the Baojia regulations and will still be forced to receive training. This matter will be handled strictly. The county government will print and distribute the lecture notes and send personnel to be stationed in each district to examine whether the training venues are being run seriously. The district chief assistants, village and town chiefs should also visit each place to check the Jia chiefs' diligence in receiving training. Those who are absent without authorization or disrupt order will be severely punished. Now that the deadline is approaching, the county government has notified the districts to handle it.</p>

It is said that he came to investigate this case.</p>

Hangzhou Mayor Zhou Xiangxian and Shanghai gentleman Du Yuesheng unveiled the plaque and led all the members to pass the bridge on the left side from both ends of the bridge. The bridge opening ceremony was completed. Since the evening of the 26th, those who came to watch from all directions have had a feeling of emptiness in the city. Superstitious men and women recited Buddhist scriptures and prayed for blessings all night long. The Danish Chargé d'affaires Huer, the German Consul General in Shanghai Klipel, the Director of Public Works of the Shanghai Municipal Council Chamson, and foreign personnel such as British engineers and French Public Works Bureau Director Wei Jun also came to watch the ceremony. The stores near Ling Bridge Road were all open all night, and the large and small hotels were full. At 3:00 pm on the 26th, it suddenly rained heavily. After the rain, a rainbow was found on the clouds, circling the bridge in the sky, coinciding with the story of Ying Biao, the governor of Mingzhou in the past, who named it Ling Bridge when he built a pontoon bridge and saw a rainbow. Although rainbows are common in summer, it is also a coincidence.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>He Yingqin and Others Send a Telegram to Shanghai: Re-persuading Chen, Li, Bai, and Others to Swiftly Withdraw Troops; the Matter of Crossing Over Is Entirely Excusable</h3>
<p>Our Shanghai Dispatch. On the 26th, He Yingqin, Cheng Qian, Zhu Peide, Tang Shengzhi, Chen Diaoyuan and other gentlemen jointly telegraphed Chen, Li, Bai and others, giving earnest advice and notifying the military and political chiefs of various provinces of the original telegram. The telegram has now arrived in Shanghai. I am eager to find it and record it as follows:</p>
<p>To the Chairmen of various provincial governments, the Pacification Commissioners, Commanders-in-Chief, Army Commanders and Division Commanders:</p>
<p>Recently, a telegram was sent to Director Chen Bonan and Division Commander Li Delin: We have read the two telegrams from Shi, etc. to the Chairman. We firmly believe that their spirit of serving the country is unwavering. However, between the words and sentences, there seems to be resentment and dissatisfaction. There are still misunderstandings and dissatisfaction with the internal and external measures of the central government in recent years. For several years, you brothers have been entrusted with important responsibilities, governing one side. In previous central conferences, you were often unable to attend due to various matters. The news from afar is inevitably divergent, and the central government's difficult support and the Chairman's determination to work hard have not been understood. However, in our opinion, from the perspective of the revolution, the Chairman is our only leader. From the perspective of duty, the Chairman is our highest superior. No matter for the party or the country, whatever opinions we have, whatever proposals we have, we should sincerely contribute them for selection. As long as it is beneficial to the country, there is no reason not to accept it with an open mind. If we only confine ourselves to what we can see from one corner, regardless of the interests of the entire country and nation, and act arbitrarily, the development of the situation will not stop until the country and nation are ruined. You brothers are wise, how can you not understand this? As for the foreign affairs issue, what our country needs today is not empty words but treasures and power. Looking around the country, the number of troops cannot be said to be small. But in reality, the military orders are not unified, and military discipline is even more lax. Insulting superiors and disregarding the government, using this to save the country is actually destroying the country. Using this to resist Japan is no different from being attached to Japan. On a small scale, we will face the danger of being defeated one by one. On a large scale, we will face the disaster of national extinction and racial reduction. I am afraid that not only will the troops of Guangdong and Guangxi not reach North China, but Guangdong and Guangxi will also be trapped as a sequel to the four northeastern provinces. In our opinion, the crisis in Guangdong and Guangxi today is actually more serious than that in North China. If you brothers know this clearly and do not quickly seek a way to save yourselves, but only clamor for sending troops to the north, you will be playing into the trick of using Chinese to control Chinese. Can those who seek loyalty to the country be like this? In short, recovering the Northeast and saving the country from danger is the overall plan of the country and the only responsibility of the government. We will never give up or shirk our responsibilities. This is what we dare to be confident in. What the central government hopes from the authorities in Guangdong and Guangxi today is how to preserve the revolutionary base created by our Prime Minister and the revolutionary soldiers who sacrificed countless lives, and not to be trapped as a result of the Northeast. In short, we hope that you brothers will first save the people of Guangdong and Guangxi, first consolidate the border defenses of Guangdong and Guangxi, and under the overall plan and unified command of the central government, save the whole country and recover the lost land. Otherwise, if we do not seek to consolidate the foundation but seek division, do not seek the unity of military orders but act freely, do not follow the national discipline but are not at peace with the duty of soldiers, then the East Corner will not be recovered, and the Sunset Valley will be lost again. What will the world say of us? We love you brothers and especially love the comrades and compatriots in Guangdong and Guangxi, so we do not want to see you brothers being misled and trapped, let alone see the comrades in Guangdong and Guangxi putting the country and nation in a catastrophic situation due to a single thought. The honor and disgrace of you brothers is the honor and disgrace of us brothers. For public or private reasons, there is an inseparable relationship. You brothers believe that the central government's dispatch of troops to Hunan is putting the cart before the horse. You must know that resisting the insult and suppressing bandits are the central government's equally important policies, and pacifying the interior and resisting foreign aggression are the central government's consistent principles. The central government has not reduced the strength of the national defense front, nor does it bear to transfer the troops from various directions to suppress bandits. However, Guangdong and Guangxi have arbitrarily crossed the border. I am deeply afraid that the sacrifices of the national soldiers and more than ten years of revolution will be destroyed by the free actions of a few generals in Guangdong and Guangxi. Therefore, we have to carefully adjust and train the troops to enter Hengyang to stop and correct the chaos and maintain local order. Moreover, in recent years, the central government has exhausted all the troops stationed in Hunan to undertake the work of resisting insults and suppressing bandits. The facts are obvious and the world can see. It can be seen that the central government not only has no intention of adding troops to Guangdong and Guangxi, but also has no intention of preventing the southwest. What the central government hopes from the soldiers in Guangdong and Guangxi is to adjust and train, firmly abide by discipline, and prepare to serve in the border areas. If the actions are like today, endangering the revolution, shaking the foundation of the country, the danger of the matter is even greater than this. Therefore, the central government has to weigh the priorities and consider both. If you brothers can truly unite to save the country and resist insults, then first seek the unity of military orders and the rectification of military discipline. Do not regard military affairs as frivolous and gamble the country on a single bet. Once the foundation is established, there will be no worries in the future. The central government can not only withdraw the troops from Hunan Province, but also order the troops in Guangdong and Guangxi to join at any time. Now your telegram calls for the troops that have withdrawn to Hunan, but why have you recently increased troops and crossed the border in Anyuan, Xunwu, Sannan, Ganzhou in Jiangxi Province, Wuping in Fujian Province, and Dushan and Duyun in Guizhou Province, requisitioning the people's grain and laborers, and even colluding with local bandits and unscrupulous troops to disrupt society and destroy transportation, and still praise it as resisting Japan? All these acts that exceed the norm may be unconscious actions of a few junior officers. The central government does not hesitate to be generous and tolerant, and observes the effect afterwards. However, can you brothers bear to ignore the pleas and appeals of the people in Guangdong, Guangxi, and neighboring provinces? For the sake of you brothers, the past may have been caused by mishearing rumors or being deceived by flatterers. Everything can be ignored. Only hope that from this day on, you will quickly withdraw the large army entering the neighboring provinces, so that the soldiers on the national defense front will have no worries about being restrained in the rear. Then the two thousand miles of coastline and border defense of Guangdong and Guangxi can also be actively rectified and gradually strengthened. Then suspicion can be removed, common trust can be established, and we can work together in harmony, unite to resist insults, and the country and nation will have a day of independence and liberation. Our soldiers will also be able to slightly reduce our sins against the country. In fact, we are all deeply grateful for your brothers' kindness. After reading your two telegrams, the Chairman made an earnest speech today, reaffirming the central government's policy of peaceful unification internally and clearly indicating the purpose of treating everyone equally and never pursuing the past. His loyalty to the country, sincerity to people, and his serious and upright manner of dealing with affairs, and his quiet and indifferent self-treatment are enough for us to learn from. The places where you brothers may have misunderstandings and dissatisfaction are also clearly explained. I hope you brothers will humbly understand and unanimously support the central government's great plan to save the country. The country and nation will truly rely on it. We, He Yingqin, Cheng Qian, Zhu Peide, Tang Shengzhi, Chen Diaoyuan, kowtow, province.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Goes to Beijing</h3>
<p>Accompanied by Feng Zhizheng and Four Others</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, Dr. Wang Chonghui, a supervisor of the Supervisory Committee of the Kuomintang, has received repeated telegram invitations from Beijing since returning to Shanghai to recuperate from his nasal disease. However, he was unable to go due to the unhealed nasal disease. It is now learned that Mr. Wang, due to frequent telegrams and the urgent need for domestic unity movements, specially took a night express train to Beijing at 11 p.m. the night before, accompanied by his secretary Feng Zhizheng and Liu Minshu and four others, to visit various parties and negotiate in time, in order to save peace in case of emergency. However, Mr. Wang, due to the unhealed nasal disease, will find it inconvenient to stay in Beijing for a long time, so he plans to return to Shanghai in the next few days, so that he can extend the treatment of nasal disease specialist Dr. Zhu Aihsun, and then go to Beijing to attend the Second Plenary Session.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi Discusses the Current Situation</h3>
<p>The military actions in Guangdong and Guangxi have not had contact with He Jian, Song Zheyuan and others who support the central government. The future of the current situation depends on the Second Plenary Session.</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, Kuomintang member Chu Minyi returned to Beijing from Shanghai on the evening of the 26th to inspect the construction of the National Assembly venue. He stayed in Beijing for one day and took the night express train back to Shanghai yesterday morning at about 7:00 a.m. He met with reporters from the Xinsheng News Agency at his residence to discuss the current situation. He did not see it as very tense. There was no news of contact in the military actions in Guangdong and Guangxi. Hunan Chairman He Jian absolutely obeyed the central government and maintained the security of Hunan Province. Zhu Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, and Shandong Chairman Han Fuqu also expressed the same. As for the good or bad of the future, it depends on the results of the Second Plenary Session. However, the central government's peaceful attitude has never changed, and it is determined to avoid domestic disputes. It is hoped that the southwest will take the overall situation as the most important and not act rashly. In addition, what Mr. Chu talked about included: matters concerning the preparation of the National Assembly. I met with Minister Jiang Zuobin yesterday and guided the inspection of the venue project. The General Election Office has decided to be established at the beginning of next month, and will be temporarily located in the School of Political Science and Law. By the end of next month or the beginning of August, the construction of the assembly venue and the art museum will be completed, and then it will be moved in. It is estimated that the number of attendees at the Second Plenary Session will be sufficient for the quorum. The enthusiasm of the participants will be greater than in the previous sessions. Various parties hope that Mr. Wang (Jingwei) can return to China to attend the Second Plenary Session. However, it is too late to rush back, and his body has not yet recovered. He will not be able to return to China for a while.</p>
<h3>The New French Ambassador to China, Mr. Naggiar, Arrives in Shanghai This Morning</h3>

<h3>Important Japanese Figures Gather in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Recent Japanese Diplomatic Trends</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, since the new Japanese Ambassador to China, Shigeyoshi Kawagoe, came to China, the Sino-Japanese diplomatic atmosphere has suddenly become tense. The activities of important Japanese figures have become even busier. Yesterday, a reporter from the Dagong News Agency specially obtained the following details from relevant parties:</p>
<p>Ambassador Kawagoe: Since the new Japanese Ambassador to China, Shigeyoshi Kawagoe, arrived in Shanghai on the 22nd of this month, he has summoned Consul General Ishii, Acting Minister Wakasugi, and Tianjin Acting Consul General Tajiri to inquire about the general situation. He has also sent telegrams to consuls in Beijing, Guangdong, Hankou and other places to draft detailed reports on the recent situation in the local area, so that they can be used as reference for diplomats. This report is also brought to Shanghai by Kuwashima to be forwarded. Therefore, Kawagoe's current term is also approved by our country's government authorities and will be held on the 3rd of next month. Therefore, Kawagoe has decided to take the Kuma-class cruiser to Beijing on the 1st of next month to meet with Chairman Lin, President Jiang, and Foreign Minister Zhang respectively, and then officially present his credentials.</p>
<p>Chief Kuwashima: Chief Kuwashima, Director of the East Asia Bureau, who is responsible for Foreign Minister Arita's important mission to China, has now completed his inspection of the Northeast, Pingjin, Guangdong, Hankou and other places and returned to Shanghai. He is staying at the Liyu Hotel on Huangpu Road. He has repeatedly visited Ambassador Kawagoe to report on the inspection process and forward the reports of Japanese consuls in various places, as well as to exchange views on Sino-Japanese diplomatic issues. He is very busy. Now, Kuwashima wants to report to Foreign Minister Arita urgently, so he does not intend to stay in Shanghai for a long time and is scheduled to take the Shanghai Maru back to Tokyo on the 2nd of next month to await orders.</p>
<p>Consul Tajiri: Tianjin Consul General Tajiri, who was summoned by Ambassador Kawagoe to inquire about the Darong Maru's shipment of smuggled goods and the refusal of our customs inspection, has visited Kawagoe several times and reported after arriving here with Secretary Sato a few days ago. He also asked for instructions on the future response policy, which has now been completed. Therefore, Tajiri will take a plane back to Tianjin at the latest within today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>Consul Ishii: After the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Taro Ishii, was ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of his country to be transferred to the Minister to Siam, his formal letter of appointment arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Therefore, Ishii is now scheduled to take the Japanese ship Fushimi Maru back to Japan on the 4th of next month to visit Foreign Minister Arita to ask for assistance and go to Siam to take office. As for his successor, Tatsuo Kawase, it is said that he will also return to his country in the near future to visit the government authorities and then come to Shanghai to take over.</p>
<h3>Investigate and Prevent Smuggling Separately: Yin Zhizhong and Others Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>The Qingdao Branch of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, because smuggling in North China is rampant, is investigating ways to prevent smuggling in various places. Therefore, Yin Zhizhong, Chairman of the Branch, Zheng Fangzheng, Standing Committee Member, and Yang Wenshen, Executive Committee Member, came to Shanghai the other day to investigate the situation in this city separately. The matter has now been completed. Yin and Yang took the night express train to Beijing on the night before. Mr. Yang will take a train from Beijing to various places along the Longhai Road and the Pinghan Road. Mr. Yin will return to Shanghai in the next few days and then go to the Yangtze River area, and then to Xi'an and other places after arriving in Sichuan. Mr. Zheng has already gone to Hangzhou and will return to Shanghai in the next few days to go to Zhengzhou, and to various places along the Chuanhan Tianjin-Pukou Railway to inspect industry and investigate smuggled goods.</p>
<h3>The Sujia Railway Will Open to Traffic on July 1st</h3>
<p>The sale of passenger tickets officially begins, the road is 75 kilometers long and has eight stations.</p>
<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration is building the Sujia Railway, which is located between the Suzhou Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and the Jiaxing Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. It is 75 kilometers long and has eight stations: Suzhou, Xiangcheng, Wujiang, Beiche, Pingwang, Shengze, Wangjiangjing, and Jiaxing. All the projects were started in Yunchun, and the earthwork and track projects have long been completed. Engineering vehicles were first opened in April. Because the arrangement of the houses in each station was not completed, the traffic was not opened for business. It is now learned that the stations and platforms on the road have been built and arranged. The Railway Administration has decided to officially open the traffic on July 1st and start business. The stationmasters of each station have also been assigned separately. The passenger ticket prices have also been drafted. The third class is 8.1 cents from Suzhou to Xiangcheng, 22.95 cents from Xiangcheng to Wujiang, 16.2 cents from Wujiang to Beiche, 16.2 cents from Beiche to Pingwang, 13.5 cents from Pingwang to Shengze, 9.45 cents from Shengze to Wangjiangjing, and 19.25 cents from Wangjiangjing to Jiaxing. The second-class fare is 80% higher than the third-class fare, and the first-class fare is 170% higher than the third-class fare. After the road is open to traffic, it will be connected to the Beijing-Zha intermodal traffic and the Zha-Beijing intermodal traffic. Passengers who go to Nanjing from the Zhaokou can take the Sujia Road shuttle bus to Suzhou from Jiaxing and then take the bus to Beijing. The time and fare are very economical.</p>
<h3>Complete the Jiangnan Railway</h3>
<p>There are many mountains along the line and the project is difficult. The budget needs more than 20 million yuan.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, railway sources said that the Ministry of Railways is to complete the Jiangnan Railway, extending from Sunjiabu, entering Zhejiang Province via Shexian, passing through Suian, and reaching Longyou of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to connect with the road. Surveying has now begun. It is said that there are many mountains along the road, so the project is difficult, and the budget reaches more than 20 million yuan. The Ministry of Railways has already raised the funds, and the materials will be handled by the Central Trust Bureau. The Ministry of Railways previously stated that the right to build the road was enjoyed by the Shangban Jiangnan Railway Company, and the Ministry approved the operating right for 30 years. Therefore, at the beginning of the plan, the company was ordered to start construction immediately. However, because the company's fund-raising plan could not be started in the short term, the Ministry of Railways started construction by itself. As for the Ministry of Railways taking back the Jingwu section that has been opened to traffic and operating it by the Ministry, it was never mentioned. However, at that time, the Ministry of Railways proposed to follow the method of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and jointly operate it by the Ministry of Railways and the company, but it did not get the company's consent, so the negotiation was abandoned long ago.</p>
<h3>The Right to Transboundary Telephone: We Are Preparing to Take It Back</h3>
<p>Department staff who lay parallel telephone lines will come to Shanghai again</p>
<p>The right of the Shanghai Telephone Company, which is run by foreign merchants, to lay telephones in the section of the road built across the border is a repeated destruction of the integrity of our country's telecommunications sovereignty. In the autumn of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Communications sent Engineer Lu to Shanghai to jointly study various historical facts with the Public Utilities Bureau of the Municipal Government and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. After a detailed study, he had negotiated with the Shanghai Telephone Company authorities to take it back several times, but without success. He often truthfully reported the negotiation process to the Ministry of Communications for approval. Later, Lu was transferred to the Director of the Tianjin Telephone Bureau, which led to the case being suspended invisibly. The focus of this case is not only that the telephone company in the concession is unwilling to give up the telephone rights, but also that our side has not reached a consensus on the distribution of powers and management supervision after the recovery.</p>
<p>Lay parallel lines</p>
<p>Since the negotiations on the recovery of transboundary telephone rights were shelved, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau followed the order of the Ministry of Communications and laid parallel telephone lines and erected multiple aerial lines on the roads built across the border in the two concessions. The project has been completed. The reason for laying the parallel lines is to prepare for the recovery of the transboundary telephone rights in the future, so that Chinese and foreign residents and users who have installed telephones will not be affected by the call when they are recovered.</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications Investigation</p>
<p>A reporter from the Dagong News Agency recently visited the relevant transportation authorities in this city and learned that the negotiations on the recovery of transboundary telephone rights have been stalled for nearly three years since the negotiations were suspended. Because the future resolution is difficult, the case has been pending for a long time. The authorities of the Ministry of Communications cannot ignore the integrity of telecommunications sovereignty and intend to make further negotiations. If the Shanghai Telephone Company abandons its original firm position and proposes a cooperative method under the principle of common understanding, our side may be able to accommodate it. The Ministry of Communications will send staff to Shanghai to re-investigate the past history of transboundary telephone rights and prepare for the negotiations.</p>
<h3>Mining Merchants Apply for Loans</h3>
<p>The two sides cannot agree on the conditions, and the consultation takes time, so it has not been successful.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, our country's mining merchants previously applied to the Ministry of Industry for relief due to lack of funds. The Ministry contacted the banking industry and agreed to borrow 10 million yuan. Then, a Mining Finance Adjustment Association was organized, and application forms and investigation forms were drafted and distributed to various mines to fill out applications. More than ten applications were received before and after, totaling more than 10 million yuan. Then, the association sent personnel to conduct a detailed investigation, approved a loan of more than 5 million yuan, and reported to the Ministry of Industry to notify the mines to proceed with the contract signing procedures. The Ministry of Industry also agreed to the second guarantee. Now, the manufacturers cannot agree to the conditions stipulated by the banking side, so the consultation has taken time and has not been successful.</p>
<h3>The French Municipal Council Levies Pharmaceutical Consultation Fees</h3>
<p>The National Pharmaceutical Association opposes</p>
<p>According to a report from colleagues in the French Concession, the National Pharmaceutical Association of this city said that recently, the Municipal Council suddenly levied a Chinese medicine pharmaceutical consultation fee on each ministry, ranging from ten to twenty-five yuan, once a year. The matter is trifling and harsh. Please quickly negotiate according to reason to avoid increasing the burden. On the afternoon of the 26th of this month, the association convened representatives of all colleagues in the district to hold an emergency meeting. The crowd was passionate and unanimous. They decided to resolutely oppose it and vowed not to retreat. The association appointed Cen Zhiliang, Li Kangnian, Tao Ran, and Yuan Pinzhang as representatives. They scheduled to carry a letter to the Municipal Council at 9:00 a.m. on the 27th to negotiate. At the same time, because the matter is of great importance and is not related to the interests of one person or one industry, they sent letters to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession and the Citizens' Federation, requesting assistance to achieve the goal and avoid leaving regrets. The letter from the association to the Municipal Council is copied as follows: It is hereby reported that, according to a report from colleagues, your council has recently levied a Chinese medicine pharmaceutical industry consultation fee. It is said that the fixed amount ranges from ten to twenty-five yuan, once a year. Caizhitang and other companies have been forced to pay it. Colleagues were shocked and ran around, surprised and inexplicable. The crowd was panicked and could not live in peace. It is said that there is no provision in the regulations for the sale of Chinese medicinal materials and pharmaceuticals to collect a consultation fee. Now your council is suddenly collecting it, which is unfounded. Moreover, the market is currently in a depression and is becoming increasingly severe. The business of Chinese medicine stores is declining, which cannot be concealed. All burdens, even the slightest, must be reduced as much as possible to maintain the difficult situation. This kind of heavy donation, which is not based on law, only makes businessmen increase the pain of fire and water, which is difficult to bear in human feelings. Even from the principle of maintaining market prosperity, it is not a good idea to drive fish into the abyss. After an emergency meeting of the entire industry and the association, it was decided to appoint Cen Zhiliang, Li Kangnian, Tao Ran, and Yuan Pinzhang as representatives to send a letter to you, please be considerate of the difficulties of businessmen, take into account the overall situation, and allow the immediate suspension of the collection, so as to follow public opinion and return the amount collected in full to show fairness. I can't help but look forward to it. This special letter is sent to the French Concession Municipal Council, please check it and give me advice. This is addressed to the French Concession Municipal Council. (Other letters are omitted).</p>

<h3>Large Amount of Black Tea Exported to Russia</h3>
<p>A total of 860 tons</p>
<p>Our country's tea production has always relied on the sales channels of countries such as Britain, France, and Russia. In recent years, due to the competition from tea from Ceylon, India, Java, etc., exports have sharply decreased. This year, the governments of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces have implemented unified control of Qimen black tea, and the distinction between quality is extremely strict. British and Russian tea merchants in this city, after testing the samples, are quite satisfied. Therefore, the purchase in the past half month has been very competitive, and the arrival of goods is almost in short supply. The price has risen to 42-43 yuan, an increase of more than 3 yuan compared with the previous month. According to a report from an export merchant, a large batch of black tea was shipped out of Shanghai to Vladivostok by Russia the other day. The quantity is 860 tons, which is the first shipment of tea to Russia this year. (Xinxin News Agency)</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign Tobacco Industry Suspends Shipments of Guangxi Tobacco Starting Today</h3>
<p>In Protest of the Provincial Government's Tobacco Monopoly</p>
<p>The Guangxi Provincial Government's decision, effective July 1st of this year, to designate the official trade bureau as the sole agent for the distribution of Guangxi-produced cigarettes, is in effect a disguised monopoly, causing widespread panic among Chinese and foreign tobacco factories. A meeting of the cigarette business committee was convened yesterday (the 27th), chaired by Mr. Shen Weiting. The Guangxi Provincial Government's establishment of a trade bureau, effective July 1st of this year, to designate it as the sole agent for the distribution of cigarettes in the province, with the trade bureau directly entering into contracts with various tobacco companies and then distributing to local merchants within the province, was discussed. It was resolved that the Guangxi Provincial Government's designation of the provincial trade bureau as the sole agent, in addition to collecting cigarette inspection fees, violates the principle of freedom of trade and is in effect a disguised monopoly, inconsistent with the central tax system. If other provinces follow suit in the future, it will greatly affect the operation of tobacco factories. In addition to telegraphing the Guangxi Provincial Government to retract its decision, all Chinese and foreign tobacco factories are unwilling to enter into cigarette sales contracts with the provincial trade bureau until it is cancelled. They are willing to suspend all shipments of tobacco to Guangxi and have requested the Tax Administration to suspend the issuance of transportation permits for Guangxi tobacco shipments and change of destination permits on June 29th. If any Chinese or foreign tobacco factory privately transports cigarettes to Guangxi through other ports, and the fact is verified by the industry, the Tax Administration should suspend the issuance of transportation permits for that factory's tobacco, regardless of whether it is transported to unified tax areas or non-unified tax areas, and no tax refunds will be granted, in order to avoid harming the business of the industry.</p>
<h3>Swire Company Only Willing to Offer Sympathy Money for the Drowning of Seven People</h3>
<p>Blaming the Sailing Boat for Not Displaying Lights; Refusing to Take Responsibility for Any Compensation</p>
<p>Swire Company's ship sank the Yu Shengmao sailing boat in the Tongsha waters off Wusongkou at 2:00 AM on the 26th of last month. All eight crew members fell into the water, and only one was rescued. The Huangsha Stone Industry Association forwarded the matter to the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, which sent personnel to negotiate. As reported in newspapers, yesterday afternoon, Swire Company sent a letter in reply to Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Ningbo Association, stating: "Upon receiving your letter regarding the collision between the late Yu Shengmao's sailing boat and the Mendo (transliteration) ship at around 2:00 AM on May 26th of this year, resulting in the sinking of the sailing boat and the drowning of seven people, we have noted the details. The Blue Funnel Line believes that the sailing boat did not display lights at the time, which is a violation of maritime regulations, so it cannot be held responsible for the occurrence of the accident. We can only express our regret. Moreover, the facts mentioned in the previous letter were acknowledged in person by the representative of the sailing boat when they contacted our company. Out of respect for humanity, our company has agreed to offer sympathy money, but we regret that we cannot be responsible for any compensation issues. We hope for your understanding. In addition to sending a separate letter, we hereby reply. To Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, Swire Company."</p>
<h3>Various Circles Telegraph for the Handling of Guangdong and Guangxi</h3>
<p>Law School Dean Chu Fucheng Telegrams the Central Government: "To the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, Chairman Lin of the National Government, and Premier Jiang of the Executive Yuan, for your perusal. The telegram from Weng Zhilong, President of Tongji University, etc., to Premier Jiang, is not entirely in line with the purpose of peace, and I refuse to sign it. Today, reading in the newspaper that Ren Hongjun, President of Sichuan University, etc., sent a telegram to the Central Government expressing deep sympathy, I hereby telegraph to add my joint signature. I respectfully request your consideration. Chu Fucheng, Dean of the Shanghai Law School, bows."</p>
<p>Workers' Movement Student Association: "Yesterday, a telegram was sent to the generals of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, addressed to Mr. Chen Bonan in Guangzhou and Mr. Li Delin and Mr. Bai Jian in Nanning. Since the September 18th Incident, foreign aggression has become increasingly urgent, and the national crisis has deepened. The entire nation deeply feels that there is no way to save the country without unity and no way to survive without unification. You all have a glorious history for the Party and the country. This time, you are planning a military campaign in southern Hunan, seeking to peep into Hengyang, using the name of resisting Japan, and marching north. You will be blamed for initiating a civil war wherever the army goes. You cannot shirk this responsibility even if you die a hundred times. The preparations made through years of painstaking efforts are not directed outwards but inwards, which is not your original intention. We deeply hope that you will rein in at the brink of the precipice, strictly order your troops to retreat to their original defense positions, to eliminate the civil war and preserve your strength. The country and the nation rely on it." (Dagong News Agency)</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Federation: "Yesterday, another telegram was sent to the Central Government: To the Central Executive Committee in Nanjing, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Military Affairs Commission, for your perusal. Since Guangdong and Guangxi claimed to resist the enemy and sent troops to neighboring provinces, the whole country has been shocked, and letters and telegrams have been calling out. Fortunately, the Central Government has tried its best to maintain peace, and the situation has been prevented from escalating. Recently, news has come that the authorities in Guangdong and Guangxi are still actively deploying military forces. For the sake of the country's vitality and the people's welfare, this association is sending another telegram to the Central Government, still adhering to the initial purpose of peace, exercising extreme patience, and strictly ordering its troops to avoid conflict. If Guangdong and Guangxi disregard reason and are willing to abandon themselves, we can only rely on you to make a decisive decision and take effective measures to maintain order and curb the chaos. The telegram is urgent, and we hope you will consider it. The Overseas Chinese Federation bows." (Xin Xin News Agency)</p>
<h3>Construction Office Orders Baoshan County Government to Build High Embankments Along the River</h3>
<p>One Meter Higher Than the Highest Water Level in 1931; Ordered to Increase Height First</p>
<p>The Construction Office of the Jiangsu Provincial Government is paying close attention to this year's flood control work. In addition to convening a meeting of responsible personnel from various flood control authorities to discuss all measures for flood communication, it is now considered that this year's flood control matters are even more important than in previous years. Therefore, the office has ordered the county governments of Baoshan and other counties along the river to first increase the height of the embankments along the river by one meter above the highest water level in 1931, to avoid being caught off guard. If necessary in the future, further increases will be ordered.</p>

<h3>Zhu Qinglan and Wang Yiting Visit Kong</h3>
<p>Requesting Subsidies for the Water Disaster Relief Association's Donations</p>
<p>Since its establishment last year, the Water Disaster Relief Association of various provinces has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in relief funds, which have been distributed to various provinces to carry out relief work. The association now has a shortfall of less than ten thousand dollars in donations received compared to relief funds disbursed. Therefore, the association's vice presidents, Zhu Qinglan and Wang Yiting, visited Mr. Kong Xiangxi, president of the association and Minister of Finance, at the Central Bank the night before, requesting assistance. It is reported that the result was quite satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Zhudi Town Businesses Request Installation of Electric Lights</h3>
<p>More than 130 businesses in Zhudi Town, west of the city, including Wang Dachang and Huang Ruzhen, believe that the town has not yet been equipped with electric lights, which is not only unsightly and inconvenient for citizens, but also has a major impact on public safety. In order to prosper the market and facilitate the public, they recently held a meeting and decided to jointly submit a petition to Director Xu of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, requesting him to order the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to arrange for installation as soon as possible. The petition stated, "Zhudi Town in the Pusong District under your jurisdiction is the westernmost territory of this city. In the past, due to the closure of the highway and traffic congestion, all kinds of public welfare undertakings were abandoned. Since the construction of the Puzao Road was automatically funded by the local area in the autumn of the year before last, transportation and communication have been greatly facilitated, and the situation has changed significantly. Zhudi is the end point of the Puzao Zhailu Road, bordering Qingpu to the south and Jiading County to the north. It used to be closed, but now it has become a thoroughfare. Its location is crucial, and it is the gateway to western Shanghai. Although it is a small place, its geographical situation is of great importance to national military, commercial, and transportation matters. However, public utilities have not been established. Now that the highway is closed, merchants are coming and going more frequently, and the prosperity of the market is expected. However, the electric lines have not been laid, and the electric lights have not been installed. Not only is it unsightly, and the city appearance is damaged, but it is also dark at night, which has a major impact on public safety. Therefore, the installation of electric lights in Zhudi is a matter of urgency. The government previously designated the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to undertake the rights of electric power installation in western Shanghai, because the authorities in the concession had proposed to install electric lights on various roads built outside the concession, which infringed on national sovereignty. This was announced to China and foreign countries and is on record. Now, various towns and villages in western Shanghai, such as Caohejing, Fahua, and Pusong, have been equipped with electric lights in sequence, which are bright and splendid, not only convenient for the public, but also improve the city appearance. Only Zhudi is lacking, and the undertaking is lagging behind, which is regrettable. Some say that the distance is relatively long, but Pusong is only about five kilometers west of Zhudi. Even the Jiangsu Fifth Model Prison is a little less than three kilometers away, but in terms of shortcuts, it can be hoped for remotely, and in reality, it is less than two kilometers. The distance can be said to be very close. Moreover, the Caozhen town must be passed in the middle of the road from the prison to Zhudi. Although the market in that town is small, it is estimated that more than 100 electric lights can be installed in the whole town. The public in the town needs electric lights, and the situation is as urgent as that in Zhudi. It is said that they have already submitted a petition to your bureau, requesting approval. Zhudi has a dense population, with at least 500 lamps in the whole town. The two towns are close together, and if they are combined, there will be more than 600 lamps. Now, for the sake of the water and electricity company, with the current that has already passed through the prison, it will be very easy to install electricity in Zhudi and Caozhen, which are very close. The cost of materials and labor is very small, and the future profits can be assured. Moreover, there are several machine oil pressing factories and rice milling factories in Zhudi, such as Shen Zhengda and Shen Yixing, which currently rely on diesel and kerosene to power their engines. Once the current is connected, it is undoubtedly a matter of course to abandon oil and use electricity. The more electricity is used, the more profit is made, which is inevitable. If Zhudi and Caozhen can be held at the same time, the result will be twice the effort. The wise company authorities will have a good grasp of the situation, and they will surely be happy to undertake this public welfare undertaking that benefits the people and makes profits, which is a win-win situation. At this time, the government is working hard to build and strive for improvement, and the people of the whole country are sincerely supporting it. Both the government and the public are working together to restore the market and save the economy as the current priority. The people of Zhudi dare not fall behind. Now, the installation of electric lights is a necessary condition for benefiting people's livelihood and prospering the market. We hereby list the reasons and submit a document requesting approval, ordering the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to send personnel to install the electricity in Zhudi as soon as possible, so as to benefit the public and prosper the market. We are truly grateful." It is said that the town's need for electric lights is extremely urgent. In addition to submitting a petition, Hou Shuda and Huang Chengbo have been sent to Shanghai to visit Director Xu and present the necessary situation in person, requesting approval.</p>
<h3>Rent Reduction Dispute in Yongyu Lane, Ximen Road</h3>
<p>Court Rules 10% Rent Reduction; City Federation Branch Notifies Tenants</p>
<p>Tenants of Yongyu Lane, Ximen Road, near Beile Road in the French Concession, are struggling to pay their rent due to the impact of the economic downturn and high rents. In August of last year, they organized the Yongyu Lane Branch of the Fourth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation to demand a rent reduction. However, the landlord, Shunji Company, consistently refused to grant a rent reduction, and further oppressed the tenants by unreasonably suing them and attaching their property. As a result, both sides filed lawsuits against each other, and the dispute has not been resolved for a year. It is now learned that the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Local Court has ruled a 10% rent reduction. The city federation branch in the lane notified its members yesterday to pay rent accordingly. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Court Ruling</p>
<p>Because the landlord refused to grant a rent reduction, the tenants unanimously stopped paying rent and deposited it in the bank. The landlord sued a large number of tenants, including Cha Jisheng, to the Second Special Court for rent arrears and executed attachments. The tenants jointly hired lawyers Ge Zhizhuang, Chen Maoxuan, and Zhang Yifan to file a counterclaim for rent reduction. Meanwhile, Yang Chongyan, a cadre of the association, represented 50 tenants in filing a lawsuit. The court has ruled and received the court's judgment yesterday, reducing the rent by 10% from May of this year.</p>
<p>City Federation Notice</p>
<p>The Yongyu Lane Branch of the Fourth District Branch of the Second Special District Citizens' Federation notified its members yesterday to pay rent accordingly. The notice stated, "This association accepted the commission of its members to demand a rent reduction. Yang Chongyan, a cadre of this association, represented 50 members and filed a lawsuit with the Second Special District Court in the counterclaim for rent reduction by the tenant of this lane, Cha Jisheng. The court has ruled and received the court's judgment on June 22nd, reducing the rent by 10% from May 1936. The rent reduction in this lane has been given a fair judgment. In addition to notifying the landlord, Shunji Company, to comply with the judgment and reduce the rent by 10% and send someone to collect the rent today, this notice is to inform members to comply with the judgment and pay the rent according to the 10% rent reduction method, so that the landlord can collect it and resolve the matter. This is of utmost importance. This notice is given."</p>
<h3>Citizens Express Disgust at Murder Case on Huanghe Road in French Concession</h3>
<p>Court Sentences Ji A'er</p>
<p>Taxpaying Chinese Association Sends Personnel to Investigate</p>
<p>The Xinxin News Agency reports that on June 5th, at the Yihe Tea House on Huanghe Road in the French Concession, Hua Detective No. 67, Sun Qiwan, shot and killed Ji Shilin from Nantong. Because the French police believed that Ji A'er, the brother of Ji Shilin, was suspected of attempted murder, they filed a public prosecution with the Second Special District Court. The court held a hearing the day before yesterday and appointed lawyer Cha Xiaobai to defend the defendant Ji A'er. The court ruled that the plaintiff Wu Cao's case be investigated by the police. Unexpectedly, the court suddenly sentenced Ji A'er to 20 days in prison the day before yesterday. Neighbors in the area were outraged upon hearing the news, believing that his brother had been killed innocently, his grievances had not been redressed, and his brother had been sentenced to imprisonment. Nothing could be more unjust in the world. The Nantong Association in Shanghai believes that Hua Detective fired without cause and killed his fellow villager Ji Shilin, but the French police ignored it. Therefore, they sent letters to the Second Special District Court and the Taxpaying Chinese Association in the French Concession the day before yesterday, advocating for justice. It is reported that the Taxpaying Chinese Association in the French Concession has sent Ye Ruiqi and Tong Lizhang to the scene of the incident to investigate and report the facts for review. Ji A'er's wife, Ji Yangshi (19 years old, from Zhenjiang), believes that A'er was killed and her husband was sentenced, so not only the dead are left with unresolved grievances, but the living have no way to live. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, she went to Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation Fourth District Branch at No. 132 Erlu to cry and report the situation, requesting justice and assistance. The association instructed Ji Yangshi to report the situation in writing for review. In order to protect the safety of citizens in the concession and prevent future incidents, the association immediately reported the situation to the duty committee so that it could schedule a meeting of the entire executive committee to discuss the matter seriously. The Nantong Association and the lawyer handling the case will also be invited to the meeting to study the response measures in detail and to value human lives.</p>
<h3>Citizens' Association Requests Cancellation of One-Way Traffic on Hankou Road</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation Twenty-first District Branch believes that the modification of one-way traffic on Hankou Road by the Public Works Department has caused great concern for the future business of the stores on the road. The association convened a meeting of the executive committee yesterday and decided to send a letter to the Taxpaying Chinese Association, urging it to uphold justice and argue reasonably, and to send a letter to the Public Works Department, requesting it to cancel the one-way traffic as soon as possible to benefit commerce. The original letters from the association to the Taxpaying Association and the Public Works Department are recorded below: "Dear Sirs, Since the Public Works Department stipulated one-way traffic on Hankou Road, the business of the stores on the road has declined sharply, so that the stores are struggling to maintain themselves. There have been daily reports of businesses closing down. Even decades-old stores such as the Wu Rongtai Fragrance Shop have been affected by the one-way traffic. Business has been slow and unsustainable, and they have now closed down for liquidation. This situation is very pitiful. Hankou Road is located in the city center of the concession, and the business district has always been prosperous. Since the traffic has become one-way, the houses on the road are empty and close together, and tourists are reluctant to move forward. It has now turned into a desolate suburb, which is truly unexpected. This association has repeatedly sent letters to the authorities requesting the cancellation of one-way traffic in order to maintain commerce. We have read in the newspaper on June 14 that the Public Works Department announced that the one-way traffic on Hankou Road has been modified. After reading it, we were shocked. It is even more severe than in the past and is a major concern for the future and business of the industries on this road. If the one-way traffic is not canceled as soon as possible, it is feared that the stores on Hankou Road will be completely closed down, and the patrol donations on the road will no longer be collected. The significant losses will be borne by both the public and business. Therefore, we have submitted the matter to the executive committee of this association for discussion. It has been decided to send a letter to the Public Works Department requesting it to cancel the one-way traffic on Hankou Road as soon as possible to benefit commerce, and to send a letter to the Taxpaying Chinese Association requesting it to uphold justice, argue reasonably, and alleviate the hardships of merchants. The record is on file. In addition to sending a separate letter, we hereby send a letter to inform you. Please investigate and handle the matter and look forward to your reply, which is extremely urgent. (The rest omitted)"</p>

<p>Valued at 5,600 Yuan</p>
<p>To Be Shipped to Shanghai Soon</p>
<p>Since its opening, the Municipal Zoo in this city has been adding to its collection of animals from time to time, and as a result, tourists have been very enthusiastic, benefiting social education significantly. Last year, in order to enrich the exhibits, the zoo purchased a giant elephant and built a new elephant palace to display it, which attracted great interest from the audience.

<h3>Butchers in Longhua and Caohejing Request Separate Slaughterhouses</h3>
<p>The Longhua and Caohejing towns in western Shanghai have a total of nine fresh meat shops, including Zhang Renda, Yang Shengji, He Fuchang, and Xin Xie Xing. Because there are no public slaughterhouses, the fresh meat sold is transported from Xujiahui after slaughter and inspection, which hinders both transportation and hygiene. In order to facilitate slaughter and inspection and to protect the hygiene of consumers, the butchers have found a site on the south side of the First Bridge of the Caohejing Station on the Hu Min Nan Zhe Road for the establishment of a slaughterhouse. This spring, they jointly submitted two petitions to the Health Bureau, requesting approval, but no instructions have been given yet. Now that summer has arrived, the scorching sun is easy to produce odors, and farmers are harmed by buying food. Yesterday, all the butchers were invited to the office of the municipal committee of the district, requesting that the situation be reported back to the Health Bureau and that personnel be dispatched to the countryside for investigation as soon as possible to approve the construction of the slaughterhouse, so as to emphasize hygiene and avoid back and forth trips.</p>

<h3>Exhibition of Bronze Inscriptions, Calligraphy, and Paintings from the Collection of Mr. Chu Chen</h3>
<p>Mr. Chu Litang of Yuhang is highly regarded for his calligraphy, painting, seal carving, and knowledge of bronze inscriptions. He has studied bronze inscriptions for decades and is particularly skilled in appraisal. Previously, he was responsible for appraising ancient artifacts, calligraphy, and paintings at the Palace Museum, meticulously selecting and categorizing them. The calligraphy and painting section was divided into three grades: the genuine and exquisite were placed in Grade A, the genuine but less refined were placed in Grade B, and ordinary items and forgeries were placed in Grade C, with clear categories and order. The ultimate achievements of ancient masters were all revealed. As a result, the visiting scholars deeply admired his expertise. Although there are some Chinese who love art, most rely on hearsay and lack genuine appreciation and diligent study. In contrast, Westerners have spared no effort in researching and collecting Chinese art. In recent years, the ancient Chinese artifacts in various European and American museums are all exquisite and unparalleled, arousing admiration. Compared to the Palace Museum's collection, they are not inferior. Private collections also contain many fine pieces, due to the dedication of Westerners to the study of Chinese art. Now, Mr. Chu, to promote Chinese art and culture, has specially exhibited his collection of rubbings from stone inscriptions, calligraphy, and paintings, from June 25th to June 29th, at the Ningbo Association on the fourth floor of Xizang Road for five days, without admission tickets, so that Chinese gentlemen who study art can fully enjoy the visual feast and promote traditional Chinese art and culture. Yesterday was the third day, and hundreds of visitors including Wu Hufan, Zhao Duru, Yao Yuqin, and Huang Ainong came to view the collection. It is said that many of the items on display are rare treasures, such as bronze vessels like the Duke Zhao of Zhu Bell, the Duke Shu Qi of Gong and the Xin Qu Zun, all exquisite objects from the Xia, Shang and Zhou Dynasties; and among the calligraphy and paintings are Tang Dynasty hand-copied scriptures, Song Dynasty hand-copied scriptures, the calligraphy of Song Dynasty Fan Wenzheng, the calligraphy of Yuan Dynasty Zhao Songxue, ink bamboo by Meihua Daoren, withered tree and bamboo rocks by Ni Yunlin, landscapes by Ming Dynasty Wen Zhengming, Dong Qichang, Tang Yin, Wang Shimin, Bada Shanren, Shi Tao, and Qing Dynasty Wang Jian, Wang Shigu, Dai Wenjie, etc., all rare masterpieces. Collectors should not miss this opportunity.</p>
<h3>Three Announcements from the Lawyers' Association</h3>

We hope that you will inform all members to actively contribute so that the goal can be achieved as soon as possible. " This association approved the same at a meeting, and it was felt that concerning the purchase of airplanes for birthday congratulations, all members had been previously notified to subscribe according to the four levels of "Fu, Lu, Shou, Xi" and that the deadline was the 15th of this month. Although many have donated, many have not. It was resolved that the subscription period should be extended. We hereby inform you that the deadline is extended to the end of June. We hope that members will actively subscribe for the sake of public welfare. " Regarding the directive from the Ministry of Justice, "This association previously received a proposal from member Xu Zuoliang that the supervisors and liquidators of banks and money shops are holding positions without performing their duties. It was requested that the same be forwarded to the Ministry of Justice for rectification. This association forwarded it to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance for rectification. Subsequently, the Ministry of Justice issued directives (the original text has been published in various newspapers) to the association. The 227th joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of this association resolved that all members should be notified for their information. We hereby inform you and enclose the original documents for your information."</p>
<h3>Shanghai County Budget Approved by the Provincial Government</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County budget for the 25th year of the Republic has been compiled by the county government and submitted to the provincial government for review. It has now been approved, and since the fiscal year is approaching, the provincial government ordered compliance yesterday. The county will soon publish it.

Fearing that the people are not fully aware, the county government instructed the district chiefs and baojia heads to inform each household of the consequences to avoid being found out or reported after the deadline.</p>
<h3>Preparations for the Shanghai West National Products Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai West National Products Exhibition, initiated by major domestic goods factories in the city, is actively preparing for its opening on July 6th. To promote domestic goods on a larger scale, a National Products Movement Committee has been established to plan various domestic goods promotion activities. The committee members will be leaders of the national products industry and prominent figures from various fields. The original letter is recorded as follows: "The purpose of this association is to promote domestic goods and develop national products. The sports field of the Times Vocational Middle School in Caojiadu, Shanghai West, has been selected as the venue, and preparations have officially begun. To expand the promotion of domestic goods, a National Products Movement Committee has been established to plan various domestic goods promotion activities in stages after the opening of this association, in order to awaken the public to use domestic goods. This matter is of great importance, and it is difficult to achieve significant results unless leaders of the domestic goods industry and prominent figures from various fields participate and support it. We admire your esteemed virtue and leadership, and we are deeply concerned about the domestic goods movement. We hereby send you a letter respectfully, inviting you to be a member of the National Products Movement Committee of this association. We hope that you will contribute your talents and provide assistance. We would be deeply honored.</p>

<h3>National Products Maintenance Association Appeals for the Use of Domestic Electrical Appliances</h3>
<p>Calling on various groups, schools, and factories, hoping for unanimous adoption to eliminate leakage.</p>
<p>The Chinese National Products Maintenance Association, to promote the adoption of domestic electrical appliances and eliminate leakage, yesterday sent letters to various groups, schools, and factories, asking them to inform their members to adopt domestic electrical appliances. The original letter stated: "The various products manufactured in our country in recent years are increasing in variety, and the quality is improving day by day. Electrical appliances such as light bulbs, electric fans, electric stoves, electric irons, and hand-cranked portable generators are well-made and surpass foreign products in quality, while also being cheaper. In principle, our domestic electrical appliances should sell well throughout the country and be in short supply. However, in reality, the opposite is true. Due to various factors, imported goods cannot compete, so factories are established in Shanghai, or products are imported in parts and reassembled. This reduces costs and allows for price competition, making it difficult for Chinese electrical appliance factories with weak capital to compete. The Shanghai Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Industry Association, recognizing this, has petitioned the Executive Yuan to issue an order to all agencies to give priority to purchasing domestic electrical appliances. This has been approved and ordered to be followed. Our association is alarmed by the current rampant smuggling and is living in constant fear. To maintain the livelihood of domestic industries, we solemnly advise all Chinese compatriots to purchase genuine domestic goods and not be deceived by foreign goods masquerading as domestic products. Only by stopping the purchase of foreign goods and adopting domestic goods can we thoroughly save the country. Domestic electrical appliance companies such as Huasheng, Huatong, Ya Pu Er, Huade, and Zhongfu are known for the superior quality of their products, which have long been popular throughout the country. Please recognize their trademarks and adopt their products to promote the industry. This will not only make our domestic industries prosperous, but also greatly benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood. We hereby sincerely send you this letter, hoping that you will approve our request and inform your members to implement it and respond in kind."</p>
<h3>Ningbo Yongjiang Ling Bridge Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Dignitaries Attend the Grand Ceremony</p>
<p>The newly built Ling Bridge in Ningbo Dongjin, commonly known as the Old Jiang Bridge or Old Pontoon Bridge, was rebuilt in May of the 23rd year of the Republic and has only recently been completed, taking two years and one month. The bridge is a three-hinged reinforced concrete arch bridge, designed by English engineer Cammson of the Shanghai Municipal Council and Mr. Zhu Quantong, manager of the Xinrenji Construction Company. The general contract was awarded to the German company Siemens, and the construction was subcontracted to the Kangyi Foreign Company. The arched pillars of the entire bridge are made of steel and painted with silver powder, making it look like a silver rainbow across the sky from a distance, which is extremely beautiful. The bridge is 320 feet long, with a 36-foot-wide roadway in the middle and 15-foot-wide sidewalks on both sides. From now on, the ancient city of Ningbo will have a new and modern building. It is said that the construction cost of the bridge reached more than 700,000 yuan, which is a huge project.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony of the Ling Bridge was held on June 27th. On June 26th, Yu Zuoting, Wang Xiaolai, Huang Yanfang, Le Zhenbao, Zhang Jiguang, Zhang Shenzhi, Sun Weifu and others (Du Yuesheng had arrived in Ningbo a few days earlier) took the Xinningshao ferry from Shanghai to participate in the ceremony.

Those who went to Ningbo from Hangzhou included Hangzhou Mayor Zhou Xiangxian and others (representing the Zhejiang Provincial Government). At eight o'clock in the morning on the 27th, when the ceremony was held, Lingqiao Road and Jiangjie Street were already crowded with people, making it difficult to walk. Tall painted archways had been placed at both ends of the bridge in advance, with red cloth curtains spread out. The sides of the arches were decorated with electric lights. The painted archways were the location of the presidium and military band. Zhou Xiangxian served as the chairman. In addition to the chairman, the participants included Du Yuesheng, Jin Tingsun, Wang Wenhan, Yu Zuoting, Chen Ruxin, County Chief Chen Lin, and Public Security Bureau Chief Yu Jimin. The ribbon was cut by the daughters of Jin Tingsun and Chen Ruxin. Kaolitie took photos of Chinese and foreign guests next to the archways to commemorate the occasion. After the ribbon-cutting was completed, firecrackers were set off, and the solemn ceremony was completed.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Rickshaw Mutual Aid Association Sends Letter of Thanks to the Municipal Council Yesterday</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Hold a Members' Congress</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Mutual Aid Association held a standing committee meeting yesterday after the Municipal Council accepted the extension of the deadline for replacing rickshaw wheels. More than ten people attended, with Shen Yong presiding. As a result of the discussions, it was resolved that the Municipal Council should be thanked for considering the current economic difficulties and exempting the mandatory wheel replacement, and that the settlement of the wheel replacement issue should be publicized in the newspapers. It was also decided to change the date and location of the members' congress to July 25th at 2:00 p.m. at the New World. The association sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday stating: "We have received your esteemed bureau's letter of June 24th stating that in view of the current economic recession, the provisions for vehicle modifications in Notice No. 4642 will be implemented with a delay. We are deeply grateful and extend our sincere thanks to your bureau on behalf of all our colleagues. We respectfully request your consideration. Furthermore, when our rickshaw colleagues inspect their vehicles or apply for licenses, they are required to present property tax receipts. In reality, the rickshaw workers' lives are already difficult, and very few of them are able to hold property tax receipts. They have no choice but to borrow them, making it difficult to verify the address of the license applicant. This makes inquiries difficult and time-consuming. Therefore, this association proposes that in the future, when inspecting vehicles or applying for licenses, this association will affix its seal and provide a letter of certification. This association not only has a more detailed investigation of all colleagues at any time, but also supervises the use of these vehicles to ensure compliance with all regulations of your bureau. The procedures are convenient, and the workers are treated with more consideration. We hope that you will approve and implement this measure."</p>

Please inform all rickshaw owners and let the lessees know to ask all rickshaw pullers when they hand over the shift.

The same is entrusted to you."</p>

<h3>Bank of America Refuses to Pay Checks</h3>
<p>A Total of More Than Ten Thousand Yuan Has Been Evaded by Gu Yubo</p>
<p>Bank of America, located at 230 Jiujiang Road, opened on April 8th of this year and announced its closure on the 30th. The bank issued a considerable number of promissory notes, which it failed to pay upon maturity. Recently, creditors Xiao Yuliang, Shen Sishen, Luo Xiangsheng, Sun Chaoyong, and others hired lawyer Lin Zhaoqing to sue the bank's Chinese manager Gu Yubo, deputy manager Zhang Xusheng, Chen Yizai, and permanent director and shareholder Bao Zi, and business director and shareholder Wu Chunlei in the civil court of the First Special District Court for payment of the notes. They also requested public service and approval for provisional execution. The complaint stated that the plaintiffs held Bank of America promissory notes issued by the defendants, including the first plaintiff holding No. 1199 dated May 7, 1936, for 7,000 yuan, the second plaintiff holding No. 1181 dated May 5 of the same year for 2,000 yuan, the third plaintiff holding No. 1188 dated May 15 of the same year for 600 yuan, and the fourth plaintiff holding No. 1187 dated May 15 of the same year for 600 yuan, for a total of four promissory notes. The above-mentioned notes (the submitted notes were ignored). Although Bank of America is registered in Hong Kong as a limited company, it is not registered with the National Government in accordance with Article 2 of the Banking Law, so it cannot be considered a legal person. Then all its shareholders are in the position of partners, and they should bear joint and several liability for all debts. Furthermore, according to the provisions of Article 2 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, the person who signs on the negotiable instrument is responsible for the literal meaning stated on the instrument. Wu Chunlei is the signer of the notes in dispute in this case, so he should be responsible for repayment. Please summon the defendants to the court and order them to jointly and severally repay the above-mentioned 10,200 yuan, with interest at 6% per annum from the due date of each note to the date of repayment, and order them to bear the litigation costs. Please also approve the provisional execution in accordance with the provisions of Article 389, Paragraph 4 of the Civil Procedure Law. It is found that the first defendant, Gu Yubo, has now disappeared, and it is requested that the public service be approved in accordance with the provisions of Article 149 of the Civil Procedure Law. The case was heard in the Fourth Court yesterday by Judge Peng. Because the summons to the defendant Gu Yubo could not be delivered, lawyer Lin requested public service. The court ordered a postponement to July 18 for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yongquan Tempted a Child to Enlist in the Army</h3>
<p>Lou Wencai's Whereabouts are Unknown</p>
<p>Lou Yunxia, a 36-year-old Anhui man who is a coppersmith in Yinxiang Town, Yangshupu, had a son named Wencai, who is now 15 years old. He inherited his father's business and was able to endure hardship. Yesterday morning, he went to Nanjing to do business and was suddenly coaxed by Zhang Yongquan, a 40-year-old Nantong man living at 132 Nancang Street, who tempted him to enlist in the army. The young Lou was ignorant and tempted by him, so he left with him. Later, Lou saw that his son had gone missing and inquired in many ways at the place, finally discovering the truth. Later, at 12:30 p.m. yesterday, he suddenly met Zhang Yongquan at Qiu Xin Bridge in Nanshi and asked him to return his son. Zhang immediately feigned a negotiation and invited Lou to a small hotel nearby. At that time, Zhang's accomplice, Zhang Dianchen, a 30-year-old Tianjin man, was already waiting there. The two immediately threatened Lou and refused to hand over his son. At that time, Lou, in a desperate situation, grabbed Zhang Yongquan and refused to let go, shouting for arrest and searching him. He found a submission, three letters, and two ten-line red grids, and a folded buckle. He brought them all to the Dongjiadu Patrol Station. After the station chief questioned Zhang Yongquan, he gave evasive answers and denied that he had privately recruited soldiers. The station had already sent Zhang Yongquan and Zhang Dianchen, along with the seized documents, to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>After Losing His Job and Living in Poverty, a Ship Mate Chopped the Shipowner with a Knife</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Three Years and Six Months After Interrogation</p>
<p>Yu Xiaoting, a native of Haimen (32 years old), used to work as a mate on the ship of his fellow villager Zhang Sanlang. Due to some reason, he was fired. After Yu lost his job, he could not find a job, and his parents, wife, and children were all supported by him, resulting in the sale of all his clothes. He resented Zhang Sanlang more and more. The more he thought about it, the angrier he became, so he bought a sharp knife somewhere. At noon on May 4th, he waited on Diswe Road. Zhang happened to pass by. Yu immediately pulled out the sharp knife and stabbed Zhang in the chest and arms. He abandoned the knife and fled without a trace. Chinese patrolman No. 634 and Chinese detective Zhao Zigan arrived at the scene after hearing the alarm and took the injured person to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. A murder weapon was found at the scene and taken back to the Hongkou Police Station. It was not until 7:45 p.m. on the 10th that the suspect Zhang was arrested on Tianzhutang Street in the French Concession and sent to the First Special Court. His confession was evasive. The victim, Zhang Sanlang, was seriously injured and could not come to court to testify even after repeated court interrogations. He was ordered to await sentencing. Yesterday, Judge Xiao passed a judgment in the Third Criminal Court, sentencing Yu Xiaoting to three years and six months of imprisonment, and confiscating the knife.</p>
<h3>Assaulting Wife and Ignoring Advice, Then Attacking Younger Brother</h3>
<p>Sister Sues Out of Indignation; Zhou Ruilin Still Tries to Deny</p>
<p>Zhou Ruilin, younger brother of Zhu Zhou, who resides at Wuyuan Road in the city, and whose older sister Zhu Zhou resides at No. 3, Lane 71, Huajie, Jing'an Temple Road, often quarreled with his wife due to disagreements, resembling a couple of enemies. He beat his wife, and when his wife's sister Zhu Zhou went to advise her younger brother, she was unexpectedly severely beaten by him, suffering serious injuries. Ms. Zhu Zhou then hired lawyer Yu Bin to file a private prosecution for assault in the District Court. Yesterday, Judge Lu held a court session to hear the case. Plaintiff Zhu Zhou, represented by lawyer Yu, appeared in court, stating that the defendant not only assaulted her but also brought detectives to her home the day before, after being summoned by the court, intending to commit illegal acts. Although they are siblings, their relationship is now severed, leaving no room for forgiveness. The plaintiff is still hospitalized due to her injuries and requests supplementary civil damages of sixty yuan. Judge Lu then questioned Zhou Ruilin, who stated he was 36 years old, from Ningbo, works as a pawnbroker, and now resides at No. 26 Haig Road. "I did not hit my sister. On June 12th, there was indeed a quarrel between my wife and me, but I never attacked my sister." The judge asked, "If you didn't hit her, how did your sister get injured?" Zhou Ruilin replied, "My sister resented me for not lending her money and because my brother-in-law guaranteed my business. My sister even wants to withdraw the guarantee. Such actions are malicious accusations." When asked about the sixty yuan in medical expenses, Zhou Ruilin replied, "I didn't hit her, so I am unwilling to pay." Judge Lu then adjourned the debate, and a verdict will be announced on the 29th. The defendant was released on bail, with his lawyer responsible for his release.</p>
<h3>Usurious Debt Forces Death; Trial Begins</h3>
<p>Defendant Considered Highly Suspicious, Bail Denied</p>
<p>Huang Shujia from Jiangbei specializes in lending money at high interest rates, exploiting people with exorbitant profits. Chen Yuebao, a worker at Fuxin Factory on Zhonghua Xin Road, borrowed fifteen yuan due to urgent need but was made to sign an IOU for twenty yuan, with a monthly interest of two yuan and forty cents, and his work badge was used as collateral. Unable to bear the burden, Chen sold six piglets for eleven yuan to make an initial payment, hoping to redeem the badge and return to work, but Huang refused. Furthermore, foreman Yu Shaotang did not allow him to work, leading Chen to desperately commit suicide by swallowing opium. His younger brother Chen Yueru reported this to the District Court, which arrested Huang and initiated a public prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Zhao Yongzhou held a court session to hear the case. The deceased's brother, Chen Yueru, knelt and kowtowed, pleading for justice. The defendant claimed that it was all the guarantor Gao Sansan's doing, who has since fled, and denied any involvement in usurious lending. His lawyer requested bail, but the judge stated that the defendant was highly suspicious and denied bail, ordering him to be detained for further investigation and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Fuh Tai Lumber Firm's Additional Tax Case; Appeal Rejected</h3>
<p>Li Shaobin's Actions Were Not Illegal, as He Was Following Orders</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, Chen Qizhang, manager of Fuh Tai Lumber Firm on Guangfu Road, was involved in a dispute when the Municipal Finance Bureau ordered the Municipal North Collection Office to collect overdue property taxes from the lumber firm dating back to the summer of the 23rd year of the Republic. The lumber firm accused Director Li Shaobin of the office of hindering freedom and dereliction of duty in the Shanghai District Court. In April of this year, the court ruled Li Shaobin not guilty. Chen Qizhang appealed to the Suzhou Higher Court, which summoned witnesses to court twice for questioning. It is now learned that the case has been decided. Li Shaobin was acting under orders to collect the overdue taxes according to regulations and did not commit any illegal acts. Therefore, the lumber firm's appeal was rejected.</p>

<h3>Ningbo Sojourners' Association in Qingdao Sends Distressed Woman to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Ms. Hu Lixiang (also known as He Lianxiang), a 23-year-old girl residing at No. 13, Tianran Lane, Qingyun Road, Zhabei, used to work as a female worker in the Zu'an Sock Factory. She was enticed to Qingdao by a local ruffian named Liu Changyu and sold to a brothel. Fortunately, the Qingdao Public Security Bureau cracked the case. The Ningbo Sojourners' Association in Qingdao has now taken her back, and the Ningbo Sojourners' Association in Shanghai, after receiving notification from the Qingdao association, has requested that she be sent to Shanghai. The correspondence is recorded below:</p>
<p>The Kidnapping</p>
<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>We have a fellow townsman, Ms. Hu Lixiang (also known as He Lianxiang), 23 years old, from Dinghai County. On the third day of the third lunar month of the intercalary year, she was abducted from Shanghai to Qingdao by the bandit Liu Changxing and sold to a brothel in Shuanghe Lane, Shanxi Road, in this city. After obtaining the money, the bandit disappeared. The Qingdao Public Security Bureau investigated the matter, arrested the bandit, and transferred him to the Qingdao District Court for sentencing. According to the victim's testimony, she is from Dinghai, Zhejiang, and resides with her father at No. 13, Tianran Lane, Qingyun Road, Zhabei, Shanghai. Her father's name is He Axi, 62 years old, who delivers goods at the waterworks every day and returns home at 5 pm. Yesterday, our association received a notification from the Qingdao District Court, requesting us to find a way to help her. Chairman Li went to the court and took the girl to the association, providing her with temporary accommodation. We originally intended to follow the precedent of assisting fellow countrymen in distress by providing her with funds to return to Shanghai. However, considering that she is a young and naive woman traveling alone over a long distance, we must be cautious to prevent any mishaps. Therefore, we are sending this special letter to request that her family send someone to Qingdao to bring her back to be reunited. This is the utmost sincerity.</p>
<p>To the Ningbo Sojourners' Association in Shanghai,</p>
<p>Sending Her to Shanghai</p>
<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>Ms. He Ding from our hometown came to the association stating that she and Axi work in Shanghai and reside at No. 13, Tianran Lane, Qingyun Road, Zhabei. He Lianxiang worked at the Zu'an Sock Factory and was not yet betrothed. Unexpectedly, on the third day of the third lunar month of the intercalary year, she disappeared without a trace. They searched for her without success. They suddenly received a letter from their daughter Lianxiang from Qingdao, informing them that she had been abducted by Liu Changxing and sold to a brothel. Their daughter was determined not to comply, and the Public Security Bureau investigated the matter, sent her to the court, and ordered the Ningbo Sojourners' Association in Qingdao to provide her with accommodation. They also requested that the family go to identify her. However, Ms. He and her husband are old and poor, unable to afford the travel expenses. Therefore, she implored your association to find a way to help them. In response, we are sending this letter to request that the Ningbo Sojourners' Association in Qingdao entrust He Lianxiang to a reliable friend on the steamer to take her to Shanghai and deliver her to our association, so that we can inform her family to reunite.</p>
<p>To the Ningbo Sojourners' Association in Qingdao,</p>

<h3>Local Area Experiences Showers Yesterday</h3>
<p>The weather in the local area has been hot and muggy for the past week, with the Fahrenheit thermometer reaching 94 degrees. Not only are pedestrians on the road fanning themselves as if dancing, but even those sitting quietly indoors are sweating profusely. Furthermore, there has been very little rainfall recently. During this season of the Yellow Plum Rains, farmers are eagerly anticipating rain. Fortunately, yesterday afternoon from 3:45 pm to 4 pm, dark clouds gathered, and a welcome rain fell. Unfortunately, it did not last long and soon cleared up.</p>

<h3>Continued Hearing of the Case of the Wife of Painter Cheng Yaosheng Sues Stepson for Occupation of Property</h3>
<p>Cheng Li Xiujin, wife of the late Anhui famous painter Cheng Yaosheng, whose residence is located at No. 190, Temple Front Street, inside Xiaodongmen, Huajie, recently hired lawyer Li Pengcheng to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, accusing her husband's stepson Cheng Yinsheng and adopted son Cheng Rongsheng of occupying the estate, requesting investigation. Because the defendants were not all present, the hearing was postponed. The day before yesterday, Chief Judge Wang Gangxu held a continued hearing. The plaintiff and her lawyer appeared in court. Only Cheng Yinsheng appeared in court, still denying that the plaintiff was the wife of his stepfather. Cheng Rongsheng was represented by a lawyer. Then, Cheng Yaosheng's nephew, Cheng Jiahuai, was summoned to court and testified that the plaintiff was indeed the wife of Cheng Yaosheng, and that Cheng Yaosheng invested 20,000 yuan to jointly open the Yongqing Money Exchange with Qin Xijiu. The court questioned the defendant Cheng Yinsheng, "Did your father invest in opening a money exchange?" Cheng replied, "There was indeed a share in the money exchange." The court then questioned the plaintiff Cheng Li Xiujin, "Since you are Cheng Yaosheng's wife, why do you write 'pity the orphaned and widowed' in your previous 1,500 yuan receipt?" The plaintiff replied, "Because Yaosheng had another mistress in Shanghai, I was afraid of causing disputes, so I wrote it that way." The court reviewed the testimonies and, because the second defendant, Cheng Rongsheng, was absent (his lawyer claimed that he was ill at home and could not attend), ordered the case to be postponed to July 8th, instructing Cheng Rongsheng to appear in court for questioning. The defending lawyer was also instructed to inform Cheng Rongsheng that he must attend court even if he is ill, and not to delay.</p>
<h3>Yi Tai Money Exchange Sues Song Ziang for Fraud and Breach of Trust</h3>
<p>Case Not Accepted Due to Jurisdictional Error</p>
<p>Song Ziang, an important staff member in the accounting department of the China Bus Company, previously embezzled over 100,000 copper coins from the company and, unable to make up for it, surrendered himself to the police, and was sentenced to imprisonment by the First Special District Court. After the matter was concluded, Li Yu, of Yi Tai Money Exchange, hired lawyer Lu Qi to file a private prosecution in the District Court for fraud and breach of trust, alleging that Song Ziang, representing the company, entered into a copper coin underwriting contract with the money exchange and fraudulently obtained 8,000 yuan in money exchange notes by deceptive means, requesting legal action. The defendant also hired lawyer Yu Xiangqin to appear in court, arguing that the case was purely a debt dispute and that jurisdiction belonged to the First Special District. Yesterday, Judge Zhao Yongzhou questioned the parties in court and then issued a ruling that the jurisdiction was incorrect, instructing the plaintiff to file a request with the Special District Court. The private prosecution was not accepted.</p>
<h3>Tram and Car Collide</h3>
<p>At around 10 pm the night before last, a French Concession No. 115 Route 2 tram, driven by driver No. 175, was traveling north on Route Doumer, passing the intersection of Rue Tenant de la Tour. Suddenly, a Pudong man, Zhang Agen, driving a Yunfei Automobile Company No. 12285 passenger car, traveling east, failed to brake in time and collided with the tram, causing the car's right front wheel and engine to be damaged. Fortunately, no one was injured. The police arrived, recorded the license plate numbers, and traffic was restored.</p>
<h3>Elderly Man Dies on Rue Pere Robert</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 11:30 am, an elderly man, about 50 years old, was walking in front of No. 148 Rue Pere Robert in the French Concession when he suddenly collapsed and died.

The body was transported to the Tongren Fu Yuan Funeral Home for an autopsy, and the Second Special District Court will be requested to send personnel to examine the body today.</p>
<h3>Local Security Guard's Assistant Kills and Injures Companion's Wife</h3>
<p>The Culprit First Took Poison</p>
<p>Gan Langsan, a local security guard's assistant from Districts 1 and 2 of Zhabei, has a wife, Wang, 41 years old, who lives in a bungalow at No. 20, Xinming Lane, Xinmin Road. A man named Chen Afang, 26 years old, from Shaoxing, used to work in a jewelry store but is now unemployed. He works as an assistant for Gan and rents a shop from Gan for one yuan per month. Yesterday at around 1 pm, for unknown reasons, Chen first took poison and then, armed with a kitchen knife, attacked Gan Wang while she was unprepared, knocking her to the ground and slashing her neck. Fortunately, she shouted for help, and neighbors arrived, seizing the knife. Wang's neck was cut with a six-inch long and one-inch deep wound on the left side. The incident was reported to the nearby Xinzha Public Security Bureau, which sent police to arrest the culprit. The injured Gan Wang was sent to Pushan Hospital for treatment, where Dr. Jia Shirong performed surgery, first suturing the wound. According to Dr. Jia, although the trachea and esophagus were not injured, there was excessive bleeding, so her life is in great danger. The arrested Chen Afang suddenly turned pale due to the poison. The internal staff of the bureau noticed this and also sent him to Pushan Hospital across the street. Dr. Jia found that Chen had taken a large amount of raw opium, and he was immediately given medication to induce vomiting. After he regained consciousness, Chen claimed to have taken opium worth eight jiao. His life is no longer in great danger, so the hospital reported it to the Xinzha Branch Bureau, which took him back into custody.</p>

<p>Qu Sun, a 33-year-old woman from Yangzhou, residing at No. 14, West Taiping Lane, No. 16, went out shopping yesterday afternoon. While walking on Heping Road outside the West Gate, she was suddenly accosted by a thug wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants who robbed her of a gold bracelet. She immediately shouted for help, and Officer No. 12759 Xu Shouhong from Precinct 2 pursued and apprehended him. The culprit identified himself as Zhang Laowu, 40 years old, from Zhenjiang. The stolen bracelet was recovered. The victim claimed the stolen item, and the thief, who robbed in broad daylight, was sent to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>

The crew tried to rescue him, but by the time they pulled him up, he had been dead for a long time. His body was taken to Pier 18, and the local security guard Qin Defang reported the incident to the Water Police General Team and also reported it to the court. Prosecutor Lei Binzhang arrived at the scene for inspection and confirmed that he had drowned. His younger brother signed a statement to claim the body for burial.</p>

Thirty-five small packets of heroin and two small packets of morphine were found in her pillow. She was taken to the police station and transferred to the women's prison. Yesterday, she was sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The Municipal Council lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the situation and requested severe punishment according to law. Detective Guo then reported that the heroin belonged to Li Amao and Liu Ashou, who are at large, and that he was selling it on their behalf for one jiao per packet and had been doing so for only four days, receiving eight jiao per day for his expenses. He begged for leniency. Judge Xiao Xie-Fen sentenced Zhang Liu to seven years in prison and confiscated the evidence.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>I have read the news item in your newspaper on the 25th of this month regarding my lawsuit with Wang Li of Ruiqin Shuyu, and the content is not entirely accurate. I am not a telegraph bureau employee, which I believe is a mistake in reporting. This concerns the reputation of the telegraph bureau, so I request that you correct it to clarify the facts. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Li Tiansheng, June 28</p>
<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>I have just read the article "Sister Died Mysteriously, Brother Greatly Suspicious" on page 14 of the Shanghai news section of your newspaper on June 27th, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. I am from Zhejiang, not Yangzhou. My wife, Liu Zongde, suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis, which was diagnosed and treated by Chinese and Western doctors for more than half a year. The medication was ineffective, and she passed away on the morning of the 22nd of this month. I immediately notified Liu's brother Zongcheng, who teaches in Yangzhou, to come to Shanghai to personally oversee the funeral. Unexpectedly, Liu Zongcheng deliberately delayed and intended to cause trouble. Therefore, on the 24th, when no one was at home, he broke in and destroyed all the household appliances. Fortunately, the neighbors reported the incident to the police, and the officer on duty, without investigating the case, made an arbitrary judgment and imposed a fine. Therefore, I will file another lawsuit to pursue legal action. I am sending this letter to clarify the truth and hope that you will publish it in the Letters to the Editor column to distinguish right from wrong.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Feng Wengen, June 27</p>

<h3>Recent Sayings</h3>
<p>— Qiū Bā</p>
<p>If you want to shout about being a person, you can only do what I do. The so-called being a person is a very broad concept, and it is nothing more than being a good person because people cannot escape the veins of society. Therefore, what we need to transform and cultivate is what is called "I". Then we have to do what I do. (Said Mr. Dong Renjian)</p>
<p>To solve the pessimistic problems of young people, we must first understand the elements of their pessimism. The most practical way is to make young people healthy in body, stable in life, and beautiful in environment. (Said Mr. Jiang Wenyu)</p>
<h3>Remembering Mr. Zhang Taiyan</h3>
<p>— Qing Qú</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Taiyan of Yuhang is known as a master of practical learning. He recently passed away in his residence in Suzhou. The news of his death has spread, and everyone is saddened by it. Mr. Zhang is both a teacher of classics and a teacher of people. From the late Qing Dynasty to the present, he has been admired by scholars at home and abroad as a guiding star. No one can compete with him. Now I will briefly describe some of his unknown anecdotes from his life so that readers may be informed.</p>
<p>After Mr. Zhang became a child, he was enrolled under the tutelage of Grand Historian Yu Quyu of Deqing to study the classics and history. People said that he wore a copper top on his examination basket, but he never took the imperial examination. Therefore, from his youth to adulthood, during the time of dynastic change, he often used anti-Manchuism as his banner. When asked about his ambitions, he said, "I am still a commoner of the Han people, not like those who have taken the imperial examinations and passed the provincial examinations. How can I not be like this?" Therefore, Huang Yizhou of Dinghai and Sun Zhongrong of Rui'an all discussed this matter with him. Their writings implicitly called for the restoration of the old order. Mr. Zhang's given name was "Jiang," and his courtesy name was "Taiyan," like Gu Tinglin of Kunshan. They only admired him for his "practical learning." How could they know that Mr. Zhang's heart, like a rooster crowing in the wind and rain, was focused on that, not this?</p>
<p>During the Gengzi year (the 26th year of the Guangxu reign, 1900), he founded the "Su Bao" in Huifu Lane, Fuzhou Road. Mr. Zhang was one of the editors. Some may not know the meaning of its name. At that time, the major newspapers in Shanghai were named "Hu" and "Shen" after the place, and "Xinwen" and "Zhongwai" literally stated what they were excerpting. But the newspaper was named "Su." What it said was not just about Suzhou, and the location of the newspaper was hundreds of miles away from Suzhou. When asked about this, Mr. Zhang smiled and said, "Su," according to the "Shuowen," is Gui Ren. The nature of Gui is spicy and pungent, and it has the meaning of good medicine. It also means "rest," implying that the newspaper is temporarily resting. But this is not enough to express the meaning of our newspaper. Doesn't the "Book of Changes" say, "Zhen Su Su," which means to rise from the ground, shock a hundred miles, to generate all things, to awaken the hibernating creatures? The image is taken from thunder, and the sound is similar to "Su," so we shout loudly and speak earnestly to shake and awaken. Zeng Huimin once said that China is a giant that sleeps first and then wakes up. I want to use a piece of paper to replace a three-inch tongue to awaken the dreams of 400 million people. This was Mr. Zhang's intention when he wrote. Unexpectedly, not long after, he was imprisoned for writing the preface to Zou Rong's "The Revolutionary Army." Some say that Mr. Zhang wrote articles for "Chang Yan Bao" and "Shi Wu Bao," but this is a mistake. At that time, "Chang Yan" was edited by Wang Rangqing, and "Shi Wu" was edited by Liang Zhuoru, which was very different from Mr. Zhang's interests, and he would never contribute even a piece of paper to them.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang held the leading position in the literary world of the southeast. Recently, he used Jin Zhang as Jimen and was known as the Libationer, but few knew that forty years ago, after the Boxer Rebellion in the north was quelled, the customs of scholars changed. Those who advertised themselves as reformers filled the sea. Mr. Zhang was in his prime. He often went to wine houses and drank with Zhang Ji, Zou Weidan (also known as Rong, from Baxian, Sichuan, only seventeen years old), and Zhang Shijian. One night, after being half drunk, he said loudly, "We four should rise up and do something in the Central Plains to plan for great achievements." The other three agreed, and they became sworn brothers. Unexpectedly, within three months, news came that Weidan had died of illness. Mr. Zhang was also inevitably imprisoned in the Western Prison for nearly three years, spending his days with Buddhist teachings to relieve the boredom of the iron window. Although Yan Xing is now engaged in legal affairs, he is still known for his writing. People often mistakenly believe that he is of the same kind, but they do not know that he is like Liu Zongyuan to Yuan Yu and Xiao Shen. Now that Mr. Zhang has passed away, I know that Xing Yan will recall the past and feel so sad, shedding tears to express his condolences.</p>
<h3>Door-Pulling Children</h3>
<p>— Zhu Shaofei</p>
<p>Every night, when I wake up, I hear "Dong..." on the door panel across the street, followed by the sound of someone calling, "Grandma, open the door! Grandma, open the door!" Sometimes I am awakened by this sound. I know it's Tiger coming home. It's already three o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p>Tiger is only thirteen years old. He has a clever face and the ability to flatter. Regardless of whether it is raining or snowing, he appears in front of the sailor's dance hall on Zhubaoshan Road every evening. When business is slow, he shrinks into a corner and takes a nap or wanders outside the door with his hands in his pockets, shouting "One, two, one, two" like he's drilling.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the person passing by is a customer, the sailors in white hats chase after them, shouting, "Come in, please!" What a clever child! He doesn't know what these words mean at all. His employer told him to shout like this, so he shouts like this.</p>
<p>Customers step into the door, pulling that spring door that is heavier than his small body. The same goes for when they leave, but he follows behind them, asking, "Motor Car," soliciting taxi business. Soliciting taxi business is the most exciting because he gets a two-dime commission for each car he gets.</p>
<p>Tiger's father passed away three years ago. There are only his grandmother and mother at home. His mother works as a maid for others, and part of their living expenses depends on Tiger's earnings.</p>
<p>Among the children in the alley, Tiger is the most pitiful. When children of the same age come back from school, Tiger just gets up, wipes his face, and heads to the dance hall to pull doors.</p>
<h3>Chen Lu Photography Exhibition Tour</h3>
<p>— A Yun</p>
<p>On the 20th of this month, Chen Chuanlin and Lu Shifu, two photography experts, jointly organized an exhibition of their new and old works on the fourth floor of the Great World Department Store. Two days later, the reporter stole half a day and drove over there for a tour.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of photographic art in Shanghai seems to have been silent for a long time. Occasionally, when passing by stores that sell Kodak products, although you can see a few pictures, they are commodities, not works of art. Once the Chen Lu Photography Exhibition opened, many friends who were tired of mechanical life and demanded spiritual food were attracted to the fourth floor of the Great World Department Store. When the reporter entered the venue, the visitors had already filled the vast exhibition hall, but there was not a single sound. The reporter also carefully lightened his footsteps. First, I looked at Mr. Chen's works, one after another, and then I got to Mr. Lu's, and I watched them one after another.</p>
<p>Here, the reporter should say a few amateurish words. I don’t care about the Paris Salon, the Chicago Salon, or the Australian Salon… I want to talk about my favorite pieces. Chen's "Shi Tao Ink Painting," "Xiaoxiang Picture," "Near and Distant Mountains," and "Sleeve Thin," and Lu's "Late Festival," "Looking at People with Admiring Eyes Again," and "Leisurely, Don't Miss Snow Clothes," I think they are all imaginary paintings that ancient masters had painstakingly tried to create but ultimately failed to express. To purify photographic art into Chinese painting drafts, shouldn't we praise the two gentlemen's skills as the most magical? Secondly, in terms of realistic subjects, there are the winding Great Wall, the magnificent Biyun Temple, the Putuo Mountain with rocky shadows and sails, and the sandy and misty frontier cities, which can all give us a chance to travel while lying down. As for "Snow Boat," which is superior for its tranquil brushstrokes, "Snow Heap," which is superior for its smooth picture, "Thousands of Miles of Mountains and Rivers," which is superior for its vast realm, "Pink Book," which is superior for its delicate clay figures, and "Road to Heaven," which is superior for its profound intentions, I cannot describe them all in detail. Looking at this achievement as a whole, it almost surpasses any previous exhibition of the Black and White Society. I should congratulate them like this.</p>
<h3>What I Saw</h3>
<p>— (Zhao Defang)</p>
<p>I haven't been back to my hometown (Pudong) for a week. Today, when I went back, I encountered a ridiculous thing!</p>
<p>In our place, almost every child wears a piece of red cloth with words written on it. It says:</p>
<p>Stonemason, Stone Monk</p>
<p>Building a Bridge, Has a Place</p>
<p>Not Concerned, Children's Affairs</p>
<p>He Will, Take Care of It Himself</p>
<p>It is said that a large bridge is being built in New Shanghai (some say Nanjing, some say other ports, with various opinions and no consensus). However, it cannot be built, so tens of thousands of children's souls must be hooked up and buried under the bridge so that the bridge can be built. However, to avoid this disaster and prevent children's souls from being hooked away, they must wear this solution on their bodies?</p>
<p>I don't know who fabricated this rumor, but it is actually being imitated by the public. It's really beyond understanding. The ignorance and blind obedience of the Chinese people can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>Swapping the Phoenix for a Lark</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Fine Rain and Slanting Wind Leave Traces / Quiet Night, Solitarily Writing a Letter of Severance</p>
<p>The eaves dripped onto the umbrella, and the water droplets splashed straight into the center of the alley. Looking back, there was something that greatly surprised him, and that was that the person under the umbrella was Miss Jiang, whom he didn't expect to go out. Feeling touched, he couldn't help but exclaim "Ee" in his mouth, but as soon as the word "Ee" came out, he immediately felt that it was wrong and tried to hold it back. Although the sound had already been made and could not be completely held back, he still lowered the tone of that word. In fact, this surprise was not only his, but also the female student's, and she also had a feeling, and a bit of sound came out of her mouth. Guoqi didn't know what her surprise meant, and the plan to talk to her when he met her hesitated for a moment but couldn't be carried out. By the time he turned around, he saw that she was a little embarrassed, lowered her small umbrella slightly, half covering her face, and left the large gatehouse. Why was she sheltering from the rain under this gatehouse instead of going to the school? This was a little strange. If she wasn't sheltering from the rain, standing here, neither entering nor leaving, what was she doing? Guoqi thought to himself, and couldn't help but look back, but she had the same feeling and had already held her umbrella straight and turned her head back. I don't know what happy thing had happened to her, but when their eyes met, she showed all her white teeth and lowered her head with a smile. This smile was completely a kind of happiness that came from the heart and could not be restrained, so she broke through the prim and proper attitude and smiled after all. Guoqi stared blankly, watching her turn the corner before going to the school. However, although he was very happy in his heart about this meeting today, he was still a little regretful. Why didn't he take this opportunity to ask her her name? Today's opportunity has passed. When he sees her tomorrow, he must speak to her no matter what. Judging by her appearance today, she seems to be a very warm person. When he asks her, even if she doesn't answer, she won't be angry. Then, there's no need to wait until tomorrow. While she's happy today, why not ask her today? This thought of Guoqi's, apart from teaching in the classroom, lingered in his mind throughout the day. When school was over in the afternoon, he didn't expect the rain to still be falling incessantly. Moreover, the wind was not small. Holding an umbrella and walking in the rain, the rain flew horizontally from under the umbrella and blew a body full of water droplets. After much effort, he walked to the alley where they met every time, and that girl also came. However, this time she was not walking but had switched to a rickshaw. Originally, the oilcloth cover in front of the car hood was raised very high. A petite woman sitting in the car could be completely blocked by this oilcloth cover. (40)</p>

<h3>Banana Peel</h3>
<p>— (Liu Hongsheng)</p>
<p>I remember when the national team and the Guangdong team competed in the football finals this spring, a spectator saw that the Guangdong team had violated the rules and cursed out loud. A Guangdong old man next to him started hitting him, so the two of them stood up aggressively. The audience behind, because their view was blocked, threw banana peels. They had no choice but to sit down and stop fighting. Now that the southwest situation is getting worse, where are the banana peels of our people?</p>
<h3>People Are Also Smuggling</h3>
<p>— Hai Shan</p>
<p>The momentum of smuggling fills everywhere. Fortunately, the government has considerable methods to stop it, which can ensure that industry and commerce do not head towards the end of the road.</p>
<p>The term smuggling is so harmful and terrifying!</p>
<p>I think that the physiological structure of people and the complexity of organization are like a small society, and they are also smuggling every day! Human smuggling can be divided into tangible smuggling and intangible smuggling. "Wasting time" is a major intangible smuggling that is difficult to recover. "Suffering from spermatorrhea" is tangible smuggling, just like the general danger of social economic outflow.</p>
<p>Human smuggling is a common disease of people and a heartbreaking thing that is easily overlooked!</p>
<p>Human smuggling is not a difficult thing as long as you are willing to carefully prevent it and use it appropriately.</p>
<p>People are also smuggling. Do you think it's strange? Haha.</p>
<h3>Sixteen</h3>
<p>One chi ten cun, one dou ten sheng, most of China's "length" and "capacity" units use the decimal system; but "weight" is different, one jin is sixteen liang, sixteen liang make one jin.</p>
<p>Why is ten liang not considered one jin, but sixteen liang make one jin? You may not pay attention to this question on weekdays, but there is a story behind it: "The world is peaceful" must be what people living in troubled times pray for day and night, right? Please count carefully, aren't the strokes of these four characters exactly sixteen? In ancient times, people prayed for world peace day and night, so even the number of strokes in these four characters, "sixteen," was considered auspicious and used in "weight," with sixteen liang making one jin.</p>
<p>Although this story is only rumored among ordinary villagers and city people, believe it or not; but from this, we can get a glimpse of the world's eagerness to hope for world peace! (Zi Ying)</p>
<h3>Talking About Leap Year Gleanings</h3>
<p>— Ai Mei</p>
<p>It's a coincidence! This year, the Western calendar is a leap year, and the ancient calendar also has a leap third month. Earlier, I had an article discussing leap years, published in this publication. Now, listening to people talk, there are still two kinds of strange plants and animals related to leap years that I didn't collect. So I made a special note of the following:</p>
<p>Lychee: It is said that the lychee in Lingnan, like the phoenix tree leaves, lotus roots, and mountain flowers I mentioned in my previous article, etc., usually bears twelve fruits per branch, but bears thirteen fruits in a leap year.</p>
<p>Leap Fish: A kind of leap fish is produced in the Dawen River in Shandong. It does not appear normally, but only in a leap year. The head of the fish even symbolizes the zodiac sign of the year. For example, this year is Bingzi, Bing belongs to fire, which is red, and the face looks like a mouse, so the fish is born with a red mouse head. When the year is over, it will disappear on its own. It's really good to say that there are no wonders in the world!</p>
<h3>Tao Society</h3>
<p>— Shang Shi</p>
<p>Donghu in Shaoxing is managed by Tao Junxuan. The lake is located at the foot of Xiaojishan, about ten li away from Wuyunmen. There is a Wanliu Bridge there. To the west of the bridge is a two-column Pingxuan, which was built to commemorate Mr. Tao Chengzhang.</p>
<p>Tao studied in Japan before the founding of the Republic of China. Because he was fascinated by the revolution, he followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen to organize the Tongmenghui, gathering comrades and advocating revolution. Later, with the Wuchang Uprising, comrades returned to China one after another, and Mr. Tao also returned quickly to participate in the revolutionary work, assisting in the military affairs of Zhejiang Province, which was particularly effective. Not long after, he was assassinated by counter-revolutionaries, and his loyal bones were buried forever. The comrades of the Tongmenghui and his disciples then established the Tao Society to preserve it for a long time.</p>
<p>In the first year of the Republic of China, Mr. Sun Yat-sen once visited the society with Mr. Hu Hanmin to pay tribute. For more than twenty years, those who visited the place would look out over the lake and remember the man.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Poems of the Third Month of Spring</h3>

<p>Again, the wheat meal is watered in front of the wind, and it is only bleak in the flying ash. The pedestrian drives his horse on the road to Jiangcheng, seeming to snatch a gourd from the wandering souls. (Qingming)</p>
<p>The secluded orchid has no proof of its heart, only transforming into floating duckweed instead of gold. It is originally accustomed to receiving the heavenly wind, why bother complaining about rising and sinking? (Willow Catkins)</p>
<p>How often have I seen foolish bees piercing the snow path, the guest wave spring river, the opening is not, but there is also flying flower white in the window.</p>

<h3>City Stadium Women's Tennis / Su Jianhua Wins the Championship</h3>
<p>Defeated Mao Yuwen by Two to Zero</p>
<p>The city-wide open women's tennis championship held at the Municipal Stadium concluded its singles final at 4:00 PM yesterday. As a result, Su Jianhua won the championship with two sets to zero. Both Su and Mao have their own strengths in tennis skills. Su is strong, while Mao is steady. However, Ms. Su loves to fight quickly and does not like to be patient. Therefore, if she is not careful, she often fails due to impatience. This is why she lost to Yan Junjiang last year. Therefore, when she played yesterday, she changed her style, increased her patience, and did not easily throw the ball, making Mao tired of running around. As a result, she defeated Miss Mao 6-3, 6-4 to win the championship. It is also heard that the stadium plans to organize a women's tennis team to compete in Beijing.</p>

<p>The Board of Trustees for the Administration of Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Funds has had its Education Committee thoroughly develop a distribution plan for the educational and cultural undertakings subsidy fund for the 25th year on the 16th and 17th of this month.

Although this amount is more than in previous years, due to the enthusiasm of various parties requesting funds and the large number of applications, in order to make the subsidy fair and suitable for actual needs, the following three points were emphasized based on the original standard for the distribution of interest income: 1.

<p>Training Facilities</p>
<p>Although the school's training power is in the hands of the principal, every teacher in the school has the responsibility of training children. The principal believes that only when all teachers take on the responsibility of training in the studio and on the playground can a high standard of training be achieved. During games, the children's order is maintained by prefects. Prefects are elected by the children themselves. The prefects are responsible to the teachers for managing the order and general behavior of the children in line and after class. Usually, there is a record book of detained students in the classroom. When a teacher believes that a student has a problem with his or her academic performance or character, the teacher can write his or her name in the record book of detained students. At the end of school, the named students will be sent to a detention room for half an hour (commonly known as "night school"). A teacher is responsible for handling student detention matters every day. Every Friday, the principal will review the record books of detained students from all levels of the school. Students who are repeatedly detained will be given a warning by the principal.</p>
<p>The school's method of warning students can be used as a reference for us. Any student who is warned will be issued a warning slip by the principal. The warning slip states the warned student's name and grade, as well as the offense committed. Below are printed a number of blank spaces for each class period of the day (such as seven blank spaces for seven classes a day). At the end of each class, the warned student must hold this slip and ask the teacher to sign and comment in the blank space for the class period. This way, the warned student can be noticed and supervised by the teacher in each of the seven classes of the day. At the end of school each day, the warned student must present this slip to the principal for review and signature, so that the principal can see whether the student has improved his or her behavior during the day. When returning home from school, the warned student must take the warning slip back and present it to his or her parents for review and signature, so that the parents can understand whether the child's academic performance and behavior have improved. In this way, a warned child can receive the attention and guidance of teachers, the principal, and parents in one day, which will certainly have a good impact on improving his or her academic performance and behavior. Blank spaces are printed on both sides of the warning slip, and each side can be used for two days, so both sides can be used for four days.</p>
<p>For children who repeatedly refuse to work hard or have bad character, the principal will use a wooden stick for corporal punishment. This corporal punishment will be strictly enforced when necessary. For students who still cannot be corrected after various corporal punishments are applied, the principal will have the right to suspend the student for one week. If the student's behavior still does not improve after returning to school after the suspension period, the principal will expel the student. Also, for students who affect the school's atmosphere or make no progress in their studies, the principal may ask them to withdraw from school voluntarily after notifying the student's parents or guardians for a considerable period of time.</p>
<p>Usually, students must wear uniforms to class. Male students must wear gray uniforms in winter and khaki or white uniforms in summer, and wear school hats. The school hat must have the school badge. Female students must wear school-colored vests and skirts, white short shirts, light blue or black athletic pants, black or white socks, black leather shoes or white rubber-soled sneakers, and wear a female school hat with the school badge. Boy Scout training is considered one of the school's daily student training activities. Male students are divided into Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts, and female students have Girl Scouts. The school's Boy Scouts have won the Rotary Cup award six times when participating in the Shanghai Westerner Boy Scout Jamboree. Religious training is also carried out daily. All students are Jewish and must participate in various religious ceremonies of Judaism within the prescribed time. (The End)</p>

<h3>On the Ways of Rural Relief in Our Country</h3>
<p>— Qi Qisheng</p>
<p>In recent years, the decline of rural economy in our country, the sharp decline in agricultural production, the wasteland of farmland, the poverty of farmers, the turmoil in rural areas, as well as the shaking of the foundation of national economy, the decline of urban economy, the lack of prosperity of industry and commerce, and the deterioration of economic panic have all led people in the country to unanimously call for the relief of agriculture and the revival of the countryside, engaging in various rural construction movements, forming a heated phenomenon of rural relief in recent years. At the same time, the government authorities have also paid great attention to the issue of rural relief. The Executive Yuan had previously established a Rural Reconstruction Committee to be responsible for rural reconstruction. Recently, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce plans to establish a Rural Capital Bureau in mid-July, with the government raising 30 million yuan in funding within six years as a fixed bonus for rural relief, and with private financial institutions jointly preparing 30 million yuan as a joint loan fund, specializing in farmers' loans, agricultural product mortgages, and agricultural product marketing and other businesses. Secondly, Sun Zhesheng, President of the Legislative Yuan, also appointed several legislators to discuss concrete methods and plans for rural relief, advocating the promotion of cooperation to solve the farmers' capital problems. As for the private sector, the rural loan activities of Shanghai banks this year will further expand their plans and expand their scope. Thus, the future rural economic relief movement will definitely become more active and concrete. However, what kind of methods should be adopted to thoroughly and effectively relieve the rural economy in our country? At this time when the rural relief movement is prevalent, we must deeply examine it.</p>
<p>Based on the actual situation of various rural relief movements today, there are thousands of methods for relief, all different from each other, but they can be roughly divided into the following six types:  The agricultural production relationship reform faction, such as the Military Commission's use of cooperative operations;  The agricultural production technology improvement faction, such as the technology improvement movement advocated by European and American-style professors and experts;  The rural loan faction, such as the credit cooperative movement centered on the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee;  The agricultural product marketing faction, such as the recent activities of Shanghai banks in the interior provinces for agricultural product mortgage loans and the establishment of agricultural product warehouses;  The rural education faction, with Dingxian as a typical example;  The rural autonomy faction, with Zouping as a representative. These movements have different methods and different results. Some are appropriate, while others have many errors. Among these six methods, the first method is the most difficult and arduous, the second method is slightly less so, but only the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth methods are the most convenient and easy to implement, so most people engaged in rural relief tend to value the latter four methods and abandon the former two methods, extremely adept at seeking ease and convenience. Now, let us examine them one by one.</p>
<p>The most effective and appropriate method for relieving the rural economy of our country is that all those who can correctly grasp the fundamental source of the decline of the Chinese rural economy unanimously advocate that the current agricultural production relationship in our country must be thoroughly reformed. Because under the current pre-capitalist tenant farmer economy and self-cultivating farmer economy's production relationship, the stagnation of agricultural technology, the decline of agricultural production, the poverty of the farmer economy, and the chaos of rural order are all inevitable results. Only by first thoroughly reforming the current agricultural production relationship, establishing a new and reasonable agricultural production relationship, so that farmers can engage in production, develop production conveniently and profitably under this new agricultural production relationship, can we hope to resolve the knot of the Chinese rural economy and relieve the decline of the rural economy. At the same time, other various rural relief and production-increasing methods can begin to exert their positive effects. However, this method of transforming the agricultural production relationship has great effects on the relief of the rural economy, but it also has many difficulties. Moreover, its essence is not a simple economic and technical problem, but an entire agricultural policy and land system, which must be established by the government as an important national policy and promoted by using political power in order to succeed. Ordinary private individuals engaged in rural relief have no way to realize this kind of policy, and can only follow other relatively convenient paths. In addition, people who generally support reality are mostly fearful and slandering of this method, so the world mostly does not dare to agree. This is actually the main reason why the rural relief undertaking in our country has not had great success to date.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are now many experts and scholars who are fascinated by the progress of European and American agricultural technology, and therefore strongly advocate the method of improving agricultural production technology in our country to relieve the rural economy in our country. However, they do not know that the improvement and development of agricultural production technology must be based on the premise of transforming the already existing decadent agricultural production relationship and establishing a new production relationship suitable for production technology in order to actively reap fruitful results. Otherwise, the old and decadent agricultural production relationship will continue, not only enough to hinder the use of new agricultural technology, but even because of the various exploitation effects dependent on the original production relationship, it will make the farmers unable to fully enjoy the production benefits increased by the use of new technology, and only provide more exploitation benefits for general exploiters, without helping the poverty of the farmers. Moreover, in fact, farmers are unbearably poor under the current harsh feudal production relationship, and it is difficult to make a living, with no surplus power to seek the improvement of production technology and the use of new agricultural implements. Based on these two major reasons, if we want to seek the improvement of agricultural production technology in our country at this stage, we must first change the current agricultural production relationship that constitutes the root cause of farmers' poverty in order to succeed. On the contrary, if we avoid this most fundamental and most important issue, and only talk emptily about superficial agricultural production technology improvements, and are enthusiastic about the local establishment of agricultural experiment fields and the use of new agricultural technologies and agricultural implements as demonstration models, not only is the meaning passive and close to superficial, but it also commits the error of abandoning the root and pursuing the branches, avoiding the urgent and seeking the slow, and concealing and confusing the correct policy for rural economic relief in our country. Therefore, the current advocates of agricultural technology improvement are actually often the maintainers of imperialism and feudal forces.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the issue of rural loans is also the same. If the rural loan movement does not focus on the improvement of the rural production relationship, then its result will only be to transform urban bank capital into rural usury capital, and to open up another direction for urban finance investment, without improving the decay of the rural economic structure at all. Farmers have only changed from the status of debt slaves of rural usurers to debt slaves of urban bank capital. Although the degree of debt may be slightly lighter, the root cause of poverty has not been eliminated, and the rural economy cannot be thoroughly relieved. The reason why the rural loan and credit cooperative activities of banks in the past had little effect on rural relief lies in this.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the agricultural product marketing issue is simply developed without connecting it to the agricultural production relationship reform movement, then the result will only be to expand the commercialization of agricultural production, strengthen the role of cities in dominating the countryside, and further promote the disintegration of farmers' self-sufficient economy, and to complete the mission of urban financial capital to control the countryside. It cannot actively help the improvement of the agricultural structure, so that the decline of the countryside can be thoroughly relieved. Moreover, because the transformation of urban financial capital into rural commercial capital is extremely strong and superior, it is easiest to monopolize and monopolize the agricultural product market, implement high-interest loans, and carry out the double exploitation of usurious exploitation of low-priced pre-purchases and unequal value transactions, making poor farmers suffer from the harsh environment of being controlled by the market and blocked by transportation, making it easier to lose their agricultural products at extremely low prices, affecting the sharp decrease in their income and the deterioration of their livelihoods. Therefore, although the development of the agricultural product marketing movement superficially has the effect of facilitating the monetization of agricultural products, if it is not carried out in a complete and reasonable rural economic structure, then its drawbacks will promote urban financial capital to gradually transform into rural usury capital and rural commercial capital. The exploitation of farmers is only fifty steps or a hundred steps away from the feudal exploitation of the past. The agricultural product marketing movement in various places in recent years has such disadvantages, which cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Also, the issue of rural education, its role in rural relief is no more than two aspects: one is to relieve the ignorance of farmers and enlighten their wisdom through education; the other is to use educational methods to guide farmers to participate in various practical activities of rural economic reform. Therefore, rural education itself is only a means to promote the rural relief movement, not the fundamental purpose of the rural relief movement. Simple rural education not only cannot solve various problems of the rural economy at all, but even if there are no other economic methods to relieve the countryside, rural education itself cannot be maintained and will eventually fail. Because there is no reason in the world to make the hungry have food and the cold have clothing by simply reciting dead books and talking about morality. The most urgent need of farmers is the problem of food, clothing, and shelter, and the requirement of knowing books and observing etiquette is secondary. However, the method to solve the problem of food, clothing, and shelter for farmers must be sought in the economic sphere outside the education problem, especially in the process of improving the agricultural production relationship, which can most effectively and satisfactorily solve the problem of food, clothing, and shelter for farmers. Today, many people engaged in the rural education movement regard rural education as the supreme magic weapon and the only way to rural relief, which is a mistaken view of reversing the root and the branch.</p>
<p>Finally, the issue of rural autonomy is similar. The result of good rural autonomy is only to establish a good rural social order for farmers, so as to facilitate the progress of agricultural production, but it itself still cannot make the rural economy obtain an active solution. The so-called "education, support, and health" three major principles contained in the rural policy are ultimately based on the "support" item as the basis for solving rural problems. It is definitely impossible to make farmers live peacefully and help each other without making farmers eat their fill, wear warm clothes, and live in good houses. Therefore, on the other hand of doing the rural autonomy movement, we must engage in the transformation of the rural economy in order to fully exert the power of the rural governance movement, and the rural order can be permanently secure. Especially for the current feudal agricultural production relationship, which is a factor of exploitation and abuse of farmers and a source of chaos in rural order, we must strive to reform it.</p>
<p>From these various reasons, it can be seen that the relief of the rural economy in our country is most appropriate and reasonable by improving the current agricultural production relationship. If we do not seek the thorough relief of the rural economy in our country, then so be it. If we want to thoroughly relieve it, we must adopt this fundamental method and follow this correct path. Even if we want to take a clever path, whether it is improving agricultural technology, engaging in rural loans, agricultural product marketing, or any method such as rural education and rural autonomy, we must connect them with the agricultural production relationship improvement movement. More precisely, we must also take the improvement of the current agricultural production relationship in our country as the premise and goal, and use various convenient relief methods as a means to achieve the goal, then its achievements will be more remarkable and its effects will be more magnificent.</p>
<p>Then, what exactly is the specific method of promoting this method of improving the agricultural production relationship to relieve the rural economy? My simple answer to this question is: First, the government must immediately and vigorously implement the land policy of "the tiller owns his land," establish a new agricultural production relationship of "the farmer owns the cultivated land," abolish the landlord economy that is the basis of feudal exploitation, so that farmers can obtain the basic means of engaging in production, and freely produce and increase production; Second, we must improve the organization of cooperatives and promote the cooperative movement, especially we must vigorously develop the use of cooperatives, so that the vast majority of isolated and scattered farmers who are weak in strength can all participate in cooperatives, and through the cooperative mechanism, gradually improve the previously isolated, disorderly, and individualistic agricultural production relationship, and form an organized, systematic, and collective economic agricultural production relationship, so that the unity of farmers' strength and the strength of cooperative organizations can be used to solve all the knots of the rural economy, and under a certain plan and guidance, carry out the consolidation of cultivated land, the improvement of technology, the increase of production, the development of land benefits, and the engagement in financial financing, agricultural product marketing, rural improvement, and the perfection of rural governance; Third, under the sound and strong cooperative organization, farmers gradually realize the benefits of the collective economy in the collective production process due to the collective labor and the collective habits and experiences of collective farming, and gradually feel the imperfections of the individual economy, and realize the obstacles and inconveniences of land private ownership, and gradually reduce their stubborn concept of land private ownership, gradually liberate the restrictions on land use relations, and provide all their land to the management of the cooperative to which they belong, and carry out the production of a uniform, reasonable, and large agricultural economy, and improve agricultural productivity to the highest stage. At this point, not only will the rural economy in our country be able to develop drastically, but it will also make the agricultural production relationship evolve from the stage of individualistic farmland ownership to the stage of collectivistic farmland co-management, establish a new agricultural system in a gradual and peaceful process, and realize the Datong world society advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. The above three points are my views on the relief and transformation of the rural areas in our country. However, due to the limited space of this article, only the main points are shown, and I will elaborate on them in future opportunities.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Sales Problems</h3>
<p>— Li Yinbei</p>
<p>The Evaluation of Agricultural Sales in Our Country's Economy</p>
<p>Agricultural sales; originally, in economic evaluation, there are several points worthy of praise. In our country's socio-economic aspect, this is particularly significant.</p>
<p>In Terms of Capital: Traditionally, our country's rural industries and urban funds have been like two earthenware jars filled with clear spring water. If there is no third empty jar to use as a transition, they will never be able to irrigate each other. Even now, the situation remains unchanged. Although warehouses and the banking industry are established in cities, their so-called "credit against goods" only happens when farmers transport rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains, tea, tobacco, etc., to their warehouses, and then they use their funds to pay the farmers in exchange. This is the so-called application of urban capital. But, in reality, farmers are people who have lived in rural villages for generations; they are several, dozens, or even hundreds of miles away from the cities. Agricultural products are not things that can be easily carried around. If farmers do not want to transport their agricultural products to the city to sell, then the only option is for urban capital to go to the countryside to accommodate the agricultural products. However, based on the scope of capital application, whether urban capital can go to the countryside to purchase agricultural products is questionable. Except for a few special agricultural products, the most common and the largest-producing agricultural products are unlikely to attract urban capital to the countryside! To fill the capital gap between rural and urban areas, there is no capital available. For example, the "rural brokers" in Nanjing are mostly scattered in small towns or larger villages in the four rural areas. They have their own rice and grain processing equipment, accumulate a small amount of capital, purchase rice from farmers, mill it into coarse rice, and then transport it to the capital city for sale. The transportation methods include carrying it on the backs of donkeys, loading it onto cars, or carrying it by manpower, depending on the quantity. Generally, larger quantities and faster roads are transported on the backs of donkeys; those near highways also use cars for transportation; and those with small quantities and short distances mostly use manpower to carry it. When the goods arrive in the capital city, they are sold directly to the merchants. After the merchants hand over the goods, they settle the payment with the brokers. The transaction is then completed. From the above facts, although agricultural brokers are middlemen among middlemen, and their main business is exploitation, their capital, grain processing equipment, donkeys, and manpower contribute to both farmers and merchants.</p>
<p>In Terms of Price: Recently, some people have advocated the cooperative sale of agricultural products. The Farmers Bank of Jiangsu Province has even established an Agricultural Products Transportation and Sales Office to act as an agent for farmers or cooperatives to sell agricultural products together. The idea of cooperative sales seems to have moved from theory to practice. However, the theory of cooperative sales is appealing, but the reality of cooperative sales cannot be entirely satisfactory! The most difficult problem to solve is the lack of certainty about the price at the place of origin and the price at the place of sale. If it is handled according to the principle of cooperative sales, then the price at the place of sale (i.e., the market price) is the standard. The price determination of the agricultural product transportation and sales methods of the Farmers Bank of Jiangsu Province is like this: According to the regulations on the sales price of consignment goods in the method, it states: "After the products arrive at the port, they will be sold at the local market price (i.e., the price at the place of sale). The consigner (farmer or cooperative) sets a minimum selling price; if the price limit is too high and cannot be sold, the original goods can be returned. All prepaid expenses are still the responsibility of the consigner to repay." Assuming that cooperative sales are implemented according to this method, then when farmers transport a boatload of rice or wheat to the market, if the local market price is high, there will be no problem. If the market price is average, then they have to calculate the shipping expenses before they can sell it. If the market price suddenly drops, on the farmer's side, should they sell cooperatively or separately? Should they sell it off or not? This puts farmers in a dilemma. It will inevitably make farmers who participate in cooperative sales resentful. In a market situation where the price at the place of origin and the price at the place of sale fluctuate and there is no definite guarantee, who would be willing to bear the risk of the price drop due to the transportation time delay in reaching the market in the middle of production and sales? Only agricultural brokers are accustomed to this kind of risk responsibility. Agricultural brokers purchase agricultural products from farmers; the price of the goods has already been paid to the farmers at the place of origin according to the price at the place of origin. After the agricultural products are transported to the market, they are resold to the merchants according to the price at the place of sale. Obviously, the three enterprise elements of "risk," "management," and "income" in the economic behavior of agricultural brokers are concentrated on one person. He himself takes the risk of investment and bears the work of management and sales. But at the same time, when the price at the place of sale rises, he can receive all the income. The responsibility of farmers who participate in the cooperative sale of agricultural products is naturally different from this.</p>
<p>(3) In Terms of Agricultural Conditions: Perhaps entrepreneurs with strong capital are thinking of bypassing agricultural brokers and directly shaking hands with farmers in the countryside. It would be great if this could be done! But in reality, it is very difficult. For example, flour mills are the largest customers of agricultural wheat. In order to collect raw materials, the factory directly sets up wheat purchasing offices in the wheat-producing areas. Initially, the plan was to directly purchase wheat from farmers; however, in fact, those who were sent to the countryside to purchase wheat did not have satisfactory results. They had to rely on merchants again. The most difficult reason is the psychology of the farmers, who believe that when outsiders come to buy goods, they consider their own goods to be rare and overvalue them, refusing to sell. The personnel of urban factories who set up wheat purchasing offices in various producing areas are not very familiar with the local situation, nor do they understand the psychological habits of the farmers. Therefore, they cannot cope with ease and achieve a profitable transaction. Only local brokers have the ability to control. Entrepreneurs who do not understand the psychological habits of farmers will inevitably cause foolish actions by farmers. The advantage of agricultural brokers is that they are familiar with the customs and human relationships in the countryside. Because, in addition to engaging in agricultural sales, some agricultural brokers are also small landlords and self-cultivating farmers.</p>
<p>(4) In Terms of Leakage: The problem of theft in the transportation of agricultural products has become an open secret. For example, the "boatmen" in a certain place, in addition to transporting their own grain and goods, steal during transportation when carrying goods on behalf of others. They usually steal two or three shi. After stealing the grain and goods, they use various methods to cover it up, so that outsiders cannot detect it. Even if they know it, they consider it an open secret! For example, if the stolen goods are rice, they sprinkle water on it before delivery, and the rice expands due to absorbing water, so the quantity is not deficient. If the stolen goods are grains, they mix in mud and sand, so the quantity and weight are restored to the original. This kind of leakage has been going on for a long time! It has become a custom and is unbreakable! Several shops in Nanjing could have gone to the countryside to purchase grain and goods themselves; however, they are all hesitant due to the smuggling of the boatmen! In principle, this kind of behavior is unethical and should not be done; however, agricultural brokers use this as a tool to control merchants.</p>
<p>2. Methods to Adjust Agricultural Sales Problems</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the methods to adjust agricultural sales problems: Currently, there are no reliable statistics on the number of agricultural brokers in our country, so we cannot understand their qualifications, sales, and accumulated malpractices. Because, as far as we know, the current agricultural brokers, because the government has always ignored them, use all kinds of exploitative methods when collecting agricultural products in the countryside! The most obvious examples are altering weights and measures, suppressing the price of goods, and heavy usury. We should voluntarily try to eliminate them. However, the fundamental solution still depends on farmers organizing themselves automatically. However, as we mentioned earlier, the most difficult thing about farmers organizing themselves to implement the cooperative sale of agricultural products is the lack of certainty about the price at the place of origin and the price at the place of sale. After the cooperative sale, it often causes resentment among farmers, which makes people who are enthusiastic about promoting cooperative sales lose the farmers' trust. To solve this problem, the only way is for the government to implement the average sale of agricultural products. However, before starting the average sale, the government must first bear the risk of subsidizing the price drop between the place of origin and the place of sale as a promotion for vigorously implementing the average sales business.</p>
<h3>The Agricultural Cooperative System of Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wenbing</p>
<p>The agricultural cooperative system in Soviet Russia is currently undergoing a major change. Any system in Soviet Russia is difficult to describe from a static point of view because every economic system is in a state of permanent reorganization. This situation is especially true for the agricultural cooperative system. The agricultural cooperative system began in 1926 and underwent a reorganization on a new basis. However, the subsequent collective farm movement, which was actively promoted, had to completely reorganize the agricultural cooperative system again. At that time, this system had not yet been fully organized. The reorganization of the agricultural cooperative system in 1926 was based on the so-called "Center." This center was divided into two main categories: one including all agricultural centers, and the other including livestock centers. The former included eight types, such as grain centers, flax centers, fruit wine and vegetable centers, etc., and the latter included six or seven types, such as sheep centers and cattle centers. The above-mentioned centers are all organized according to the political and economic structure of Russia. Therefore, the lowest level is the village center, followed by the town center, then the county center, the provincial center, and finally the organization of the federal republic. However, in reality, not all centers have this kind of hierarchy. There is often no more than one center in a village, or even no more than one center in the entire province. However, there may be representatives of several centers in a village. The centers try to make a village specialize in the production of one major item, so a corresponding center is established in the village. But in reality, in addition to the main item handled by the center, there are often other products. Therefore, all surplus products, even if they are not handled by the center, are also purchased by the center and prepared to be sent to the center's town organization, county organization, and provincial organization in a village. Although there is an organization of a milk center in the village, if there are a few leftover chicks or eggs in the village, they can also be purchased by the milk center. However, poultry products should be transferred to the poultry center at the most convenient collection point. Each province has a center federation to connect the centers. And in each federal republic, there is a federation composed of provincial federations.</p>
<p>The original responsibilities of these centers were mostly to buy and sell products for the cooperative societies to which they belonged. But since its development, it has also emphasized production activities. Now a kind of contract system (System of Contraction) has been created. It is a futures trading plan. For example, the grain center and the village or individual farmer sign an agreement, in which the grain center provides him with goods or labor, and the village or individual farmer agrees to repay the price after the harvest and sell the grain to the grain center. According to the original plan, the contract could be concluded by the center with the village or individual. But since the harvest of 1929, contracts have no longer been concluded with individual farmers. The duration of the contract can be from one year to nine years. According to the contract, the grain center agrees to supply fertilizer seeds, and even use machines to cultivate the land for the farmers. If the contract stipulates that the cultivated land includes the whole, then the 'strip system' of the farmland recognized by the village is cancelled. If the village wants to cultivate the land itself, then the land must be cultivated very deeply and well. If the village wants to prepare seeds itself, then the village should select the seeds very well before sowing. In addition, there are various different contracts. As for the price at which the village sells grain is low. In 1929, the contract system was very popular. Seventy-five percent of the grain in that year was stipulated in the contract, and the government hoped that all harvests in 1932 would use the contract method. But after the free land farms developed, the situation changed greatly. Most of the grain goes through the collective farms, and the grain centers are not taken lightly. In the future, perhaps an agreement will be established between the collective farm center and the grain center to remedy the situation, which is not unpredictable. As for the work of the class center, it is similar to the grain center and also adopts a contract system. Thirty-five percent of the land for concluding agreements is also. The work of the butter center is also similar.</p>
<p>There are four economic sources for cooperative centers: one is loans from cooperative banks, two is the agricultural cooperative system, three is loans from national banks, and four is government subsidies. As for the income of the village, in addition to deducting the amount due to the centers, if there is a small surplus, it should also be accumulated as a public reserve fund.</p>
<p>The activities of each center have one most important goal. That is to cultivate a common habit among farmers in preparation for organizing group farms. As for those who serve in cooperative organizations, there is no different position from those who serve in state organizations. Their first priority is to be loyal to the party. As for the interests of the members of the cooperative organization in which they are located, they do not consider them important. The economic plan approved by the party is the most important. Therefore, cooperative personnel do their best to do anything that is beneficial to the greatest goal of the entire Russian economy. We can boldly say that the great development of the Soviet cooperative movement is not a victory for the cooperative concept, but an example of using the cooperative system to create a socialist economic system.</p>

<h3>Securities: Bond Market Trended Down Last Week</h3>
<p>Most Bonds Saw New Low Prices</p>
<p>Result: Small Decline of 50 Cents to Over One Yuan</p>
<p>Last week (June 22nd to 27th) at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, due to the Summer Solstice and the delivery of June futures, the market was closed for two days. Actual trading only took place for four days. It was the transition period between the June and August futures. In this eventful environment, the bond market saw dramatic volatility. New low prices were discovered. The market's speculative psychology was mostly focused on how the Southwest incident would be resolved and the outcome of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee. The situation in North China and the state of smuggling became clearer due to the telegrams from Korea. Given this situation, spot bonds naturally flowed out, and the decline was an unavoidable fact. Cash flight further caused investors to focus on how the situation would evolve when considering the future price increases and decreases. Looking back on last week, Monday was the last day for June futures. There were rumors of contact at the front lines. Major bullish players turned bearish, causing a small squeeze of about one yuan. Tuesday was a market holiday for the Summer Solstice. On Wednesday, only the July contract was traded. There were rumors of the organization of a military commission in Guangdong and Guangxi, causing a drop at the opening, and new low prices were discovered for each bond. Then, it gradually recovered, resulting in a stable outcome. On Thursday, the August futures started trading. The situation on the Hunan border was uneasy, and North China also seemed tense. There were also rumors in the market about increasing margin requirements. Market prices also fluctuated greatly, but the result was still stable. Friday was a market holiday for the delivery of June futures. On Saturday, the situation was gloomy, and retail investors covered their short positions, while major players sold, releasing positions at high prices. Market prices actually recovered by 30 to 50 cents. With the situation brewing and waiting for change, the bond market should show signs of volatility. The final result was a small decline of 50 cents to over one yuan. The total turnover was 39.8 million yuan. The following table compares the results of the increases and decreases (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>
<p>Bond Type:	Highest Price (Term)	Lowest Price (Term)	Compared to Last Week	Trading Volume</p>
<p>Unified E, June	58.15 (1)	57.65 (1)	Down 0.65	9,350</p>
<p>Unified E, July	58.50 (4)	57.20 (3)	Down 0.45	62,800</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: American Cotton Market Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with mixed conditions. Prices for each month fell by one pound to rise by five pounds. The July contract rose due to short covering by traders, spot merchants, and local buyers. New cotton was weak due to selling by retail investors, the Far East, Liverpool buyers, and the South. Sellers were not eager to sell, and then bought back at limit prices. Japanese merchants bought, and the market was firm. However, until there is progress in the policy of auctioning the October contract in the stockpiled cotton area, people are still hesitant. The textile market is quiet but firm because spot cotton prices are still firm. The close was firm. Spot prices rose by six pounds, and futures prices rose by four to six pounds. British cotton spot prices rose by three points, and futures prices rose or fell by one point. Indian cotton initially fell due to short selling, but later rebounded due to good news from Liverpool, buying by European exporters and speculators. The Pingguo contract rose by two rupees, while Aomura and Bai Luoxi fell by 0.25 to 0.5 rupees. Original telegrams are recorded on the left (telegram of the 27th):</p>

<p>Grains: Rice Market Still Stable</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the total arrival of goods from various sources was about 34 or 35 shipments, totaling over 7,000 shi, of which thin rice accounted for half. Therefore, although the Dalian merchants handled over 1,000 packages of thin rice, the market price was reduced by 5 or 6 cents. Thick japonica early rice was very sluggish in the local market, and the price was also reduced by several cents to nearly a foot. Duyang Jian also dropped by a few cents. Yin Bian Yuan's supply and demand were similar, and the market price was stable.</p>

<h3>Special Feature: Last Year's World Sugar Production and Sales</h3>
<p>— Wang Nai</p>
<p>1.  World Sugar Consumption</p>
<p>Our country's sugar production is insufficient to meet domestic demand. The sugar used throughout the country largely relies on imports. Therefore, the state of world sugar production and sales is deeply related to our people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>The most depressed period in the world sugar industry in recent decades was last year. Throughout the year, sugar prices remained consistently low, offering no possibility of profit. Speculators had no room to maneuver, and factories maintained only their existing production rates, with no major reforms in the sugar industry taking place. The only noteworthy development was the reduction in raw material production in several countries, as evidenced by the reduction of sugar stocks by 1.8 million tons last year. This phenomenon has led some sugar merchants to believe that sugar prices will inevitably rise, making it a worthwhile investment. However, they seem unaware of the vast amount of sugar in storage worldwide. (World sugar stocks in 1932 were 12,069,000 tons, in 1933 they were 10,568,000 tons, and in 1934 they were 9,750,000 tons.) The future is not necessarily optimistic. When the International Sugar Agreement was concluded in Brussels, Belgium, on May 9, 1932, all participating countries—especially those in East Asia—were hopeful for increased sales. However, during the conference, intense competition arose regarding export restrictions, resulting in all countries ultimately failing to export the agreed-upon quantities. (Because non-participating countries seized the opportunity to dump their sugar, the adherence of participating countries was futile.) The following table lists the world's raw sugar consumption over the past six years: (Unit: Thousands of Metric Tons)</p>
<p>Category       1929-30   1930-31   1931-32   1932-33   1933-34   1934-35</p>
<p>Europe       8,746     8,880     8,601     8,       8,690     8,771</p>
<p>USSR          1,25     1,630     1,300     85       1,100     1,450</p>
<p>Asia          4,192     1,194     3,705     3,47     3,500     2,565</p>
<p>Africa        795       840       829       795       851       802</p>
<p>Australia     450       455       470       465       460       460</p>
<p>Americas      8,707     8,400     8,340     8,369     8,365     8,124</p>
<p>Total        24,140   24,299   23,15   ,066   ,970   ,273</p>
<p>(Note) Includes sugar from India, Java, and other regions.</p>
<p>Although the total is slightly higher than in the previous three years, this may be due to the effects of the agreement. However, compared to before 1931, the difference is vast. Last year, except for Europe, Asia, and the Soviet Union, other regions saw a slight decrease compared to the previous year, indicating that the sales power of sugar remains weak.

<p>The Road to Health</p>
<h3>Neurasthenia and Insomnia</h3>
<p>Hormone Preparations May Help</p>
<p>Neurasthenia is closely related to insomnia. The causes of neurasthenia are varied, the most common being excessive studying, intense mental calculation, or overwork, leading to gradual weakening of the nerves and insomnia. In some cases, during youth, external temptations and hormonal stimulation may lead to masturbation. Frequent indulgence in this practice can gradually lead to nervous system dysfunction. The most prominent symptoms include not only insomnia but also a loss of interest in work, irritability, mental agitation, constant restlessness, a feeling of loss, and seminal emission, premature ejaculation, and abnormal erectile function. This can lead to increasing pessimism, mental anguish, dizziness, anemia, muscle relaxation, and loss of elasticity. The complexion becomes pale and yellow, appetite decreases, memory deteriorates, and the limbs feel weak and powerless. In women, the breasts and buttocks may fail to develop properly, menstruation may be delayed or difficult, and leucorrhea may occur. Other symptoms are the same as in men. Infertility after prolonged marriage is also a common symptom in both sexes.</p>
<p>The underlying cause is nothing more than a deficiency in internal secretions. To remedy this, the only solution is to replenish the internal secretions to ensure complete development of the reproductive glands. Therefore, Dr. Mellen invented "Vitol," for men and "Feminol" for women. These medications are made from the testicles and ovaries of healthy, youthful male and female animals. Their hormones are extracted using scientific methods and prepared separately. After taking these medications, the nerves can be strengthened and calmed, thus curing neurasthenia and insomnia. They also have a significant transformative effect on the tissues of the sex glands in both men and women. All conditions such as seminal emission, premature ejaculation, weak erection, irregular menstruation in women, and infertility can be cured. Their effectiveness surpasses that of any other hormone preparation.</p>
<h3>Clinical Success of Gonacrine</h3>
<p>The Latest Success in Gonorrhea Treatment</p>
<p>Gonorrhea poses a major threat to civilized nations. It can damage the vitality of the population, destroy reproductive capabilities, and lead to national decline. Therefore, gonorrhea is generally regarded as a major disease that endangers the country and the race.</p>
<p>As a result, scientists have been diligently researching ways to conquer this disease-causing bacterium. Although there have been some discoveries, they have not achieved the ideal results, and gonorrhea continues to spread, with sufferers everywhere. Among these efforts, the drug "Gonacrine," invented by Dr. Peter, stands out as a leader in gonorrhea treatment. This is because "Gonacrine" is composed purely of antibacterial and antitoxic ingredients. After administration, its medicinal effects act directly on the lesions, and it also generates anti-gonococcal immunity within the body. Therefore, regardless of where the gonococci spread within the body, "Gonacrine" can surround and kill them without harming healthy tissues. This is a unique advantage not found in other gonorrhea medications. Therefore, whether it's localized gonorrhea, such as prostatitis, orchitis, anterior and posterior urethritis, spermatic cord inflammation, seminal vesiculitis, or systemic infections like periostitis and arthritis, "Gonacrine" can achieve remarkable results. It truly represents a new achievement in the modern history of gonorrhea treatment. Medical professionals in Eastern and Western countries alike are happy to adopt it. For women suffering from gonorrheal leukorrhea, "Gonacrine" can be taken internally, while "Car-Shedine Vaginal Tablets" can be used externally as suppositories to achieve a cure in a short period.</p>
<h3>Easily Confused Gastrointestinal Catarrh</h3>
<p>The intestines and stomach are essentially sister organs, both primarily responsible for digestion. Food enters the stomach and, after a relatively short period, is transported to the intestines, where it can be fully digested. If the stomach has inflammatory symptoms (catarrh), digestion will be poor, causing belching and vomiting, and bowel movements will be irregular, either dry and difficult or loose with abdominal pain. Enteritis can also present with similar symptoms. The causes are generally the consumption of spoiled food or excessively hot or cold foods. During the summer months, people often neglect hygiene, indulging in ice cream, melons, and other cold foods, leading to a surge in this condition. If not treated promptly, it can become chronic, turning into a lifelong ailment.</p>
<p>Treatment for stomach problems involves reducing the acidity and fermentation stimulation of the mucous membrane and reorganizing its cells to restore them to health. Treatment for intestinal problems requires rapid elimination of inflammation and correction of peristaltic function. Therefore, the effectiveness of preparations for treating gastrointestinal disorders varies greatly. However, "Strong Stomach Essence" from the French-owned French Chemical Factory offers multiple benefits. Because it is made from zymase and antiseptic and disinfectant ingredients, it can be used not only as an intestinal disinfectant, reducing gas and quickly relieving constipation and flatulence, but also providing relief from diarrhea and abdominal pain. It is also a reliable remedy for stomach ailments, whether acute or chronic, relieving frequent belching, chest tightness, acid reflux, vomiting, nausea, bloating after meals, and dull stomach pain. Its ability to nourish the blood and brain is also significant. The medication also contains lecithin, making it a good remedy for smokers who are quitting or suffering from constipation. It is gentle and can be used as a year-round tonic.</p>
<h3>Treatment for Seminal Emission</h3>
<p>Due to the recent social trends, the number of patients suffering from seminal emission is increasing daily. Various medications for seminal emission flood the market, most of which merely aim to block the spermatic ducts, leading to significant side effects. Only preparations that reduce self-stimulation of the sexual nerves can achieve good results.</p>
<p>"Nutrine Tablets," produced by Dr. Nye, effectively regulate sexual tissues and correct sexual nerves. Therefore, this medication is effective for seminal emission, whether it occurs several times a week, nocturnal emission, or leakage of semen during bowel movements or urination. Because this medication can enhance willpower, it can help break the habit of masturbation, and it can also cure neurasthenia, dizziness, and headaches caused by seminal emission. It is reportedly available at the Sino-Western Pharmacy on Fourth Avenue in this city.</p>
<h3>Critique of the Latest Gonorrhea Treatment Methods</h3>
<p>As the world progresses toward civilization, gonorrhea is spreading more and more. Doctors treat it with internal medications, injections, heat therapy, and other methods. However, since the route of transmission involves gonococci entering the urethra, the most important goal is to reduce the bacteria. Although there are many sterilizing agents, it is difficult to find one that is truly effective. This is not to say that they have no effect, but they only work locally and kill bacteria on the surface, leading to recurrence. Recently, European countries have praised non-specific therapy for gonorrhea. According to reports from major hospitals, over 93 out of 100 men and 95 out of 100 women have been cured within a short period and confirmed to have no recurrence. Therefore, the saying "science is omnipotent" is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Non-specific therapy involves using immune elements from animal bodies and plant-derived lipids to promote the body's powerful antitoxic capabilities. "Gonacrine" has this effect. It is an internally administered medication based on this pharmacological principle. Because it is a non-specific therapy, it can empower cells with powerful antitoxic functions and enhance the phagocytic activity of white blood cells. Therefore, the body and blood suddenly have an inexhaustible source of antibacterial power, and gonococci, no matter how stubborn, cannot survive. Thus, both men and women suffering from acute or chronic gonorrhea and severe arthritis, as well as men with prostatitis, orchitis, and bladder inflammation, and women with uterine and vaginal gonorrhea, can all be cured with this medication within a few weeks. It can completely eradicate the disease, and it is gentle, with no irritating or stomach-upsetting side effects. However, when purchasing, it is important to pay close attention to the name "Gonacrine" and avoid being misled by others into buying miscellaneous, cheap, and inferior medications, which can harm other parts of the body or endanger life.</p>
<h3>Pulmonary Tuberculosis and Asthma</h3>
<p>The main symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis include coughing up blood or phlegm and exhibiting significant weakness. There is often a sharp decline in appetite, night sweats, and fatigue, and it may be complicated by bronchitis or heart failure, leading to asthma. Asthma, however, is more common in middle-aged and older individuals, who appear pale and swollen, with excessive phlegm. Treatment involves rest and tonic medications.</p>
<p>Existing over-the-counter medications often fail to fully meet the needs of clinical physicians. Medications that are effective for treating tuberculosis may not prevent the aggravation of inflammation in the trachea or have a strengthening effect. Medications that treat general respiratory inflammation often cannot specifically treat tuberculosis, making it difficult to achieve a comprehensive cure.</p>
<p>Based on his experience, Dr. Tu extracted the effective ingredients from various mineral agents and, through scientific and specialized procedures, formulated "Pulmo-Nal," a medication that is remarkably effective for various respiratory ailments. Because it has antiseptic properties, asthma and phlegm accumulation can be cured, and it prevents lung gangrene. It is also effective for colds, whooping cough, persistent coughs, and stubborn phlegm. This medication effectively increases calcium in the body, so it promotes the growth of connective tissue and encapsulates tubercle bacilli, causing them to lose their vitality. As a result, the release of toxins is reduced, alleviating symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and physical weakness. Coughing up blood or phlegm, coughing, chest pain, anemia, and poor appetite can also be eliminated through the medication's anti-tuberculosis and antibacterial effects, as well as its ability to strengthen the body. In women with menstrual irregularities and men with seminal emission and kidney deficiency who also suffer from tuberculosis, and who also have symptoms of brain weakness, insomnia, and palpitations, "Feminol" for women and "Vitol" for men can be taken concurrently. Women can achieve menstrual regulation and blood replenishment, while men can achieve sperm strengthening and kidney consolidation. Combining treatments in this way can revive the withered and bring spring back to decaying trees!</p>

<h3>A Collection of "Gonacrine" Treatment Cases</h3>
<p>Purulent Blood Erupts</p>
<p>Patient Yan Chibao, newly afflicted with gonorrhea, displayed rather dangerous symptoms. The local symptoms included stinging pain in the urethra, inflammation and swelling of the glans, and inflammation and redness inside the foreskin due to the accumulation of dirt. Purulent blood flowed from the urethra, frequent urges to urinate, and extreme difficulty in urination. Often, after half an hour of trying, only a few drops could be passed. Systemic symptoms included high fever, mental fatigue, physical weakness, and thirst. After trying other medications with little effect, he switched to "Gonacrine." Within two weeks, the inflammation had greatly reduced, and urination became much easier, alleviating much of the pain he had been experiencing. He continued taking it for another ten days or so, achieving a full recovery. He underwent a message sonication test at the doctor's office, and there were no changes in the gonorrhea. This proves that it has been cured completely.</p>
<p>Weak Body, White Turbidity</p>
<p>Patient Liu Renshu, who was naturally weak, had been plagued by illness. Later, he visited a brothel and contracted gonorrhea. Because of his weak constitution, the symptoms of gonorrhea were not particularly severe, but there was no sign of improvement, and his body became even weaker. Repeated treatments were ineffective. Then, on the recommendation of a doctor, he took "Gonacrine" to eliminate the gonorrhea and "Vitol" to strengthen his body. Within a very short period, the gonococci were completely eliminated, and his body became stronger than ever. He was a completely different person.</p>
<p>Suffering Shared</p>
<p>Patient Xie Qingfeng contracted gonorrhea due to his fondness for socializing. Soon after, he infected his wife, causing their happiness to be consumed by this gonococcus. Mr. Xie had traveled to major commercial ports in China for treatment, but to no avail, and he returned home in despair. Fortunately, his colleague Hui Mengshi obtained the highly effective gonorrhea treatment "Gonacrine." After taking it for a short period, he experienced remarkable results. He continued taking it for several weeks and was cured. He then purchased half a dozen "Gonacrine" tablets and several bottles of "Car-Shedine Vaginal Tablets" for his wife's gonorrheal leukorrhea. After his wife took "Gonacrine" internally and used the "Vaginal Tablets" externally as suppositories, her condition improved daily, the vaginal discharge decreased, and the erosion in the vaginal area healed. Everything returned to normal, and soon after, she gave birth to a son.</p>
<p>Joint Pain</p>
<p>Patient Wu Fenting had suffered from gonorrhea for five or six years, and repeated treatments had been ineffective, leading to arthritis. The joints were swollen and painful, making it difficult to bend or stretch. The urine was turbid, with a large amount of gonorrhea flakes. Sometimes, urination was not smooth, and blood followed after urination. The testicles also felt slightly hard, swollen, and painful. On the recommendation of his friend Shen Jixiong, he took "Gonacrine." After more than half a month, the swelling and pain had decreased by 60-70%, and he could move freely. He continued taking it continuously for several weeks and was completely cured. He underwent blood serum tests more than ten times, and there was never a gonococcal reaction. Therefore, it has never recurred in the past few years. Mr. Wu is grateful and praises the great and accurate efficacy of "Gonacrine" everywhere.</p>

<h3>New Treatment for Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>In the sweltering heat of summer, it is essential to maintain cleanliness and hygiene to avoid illness. However, women suffering from leukorrhea are often filled with worry in the summer because the condition is chronic and difficult to cure. A constant flow of yellow and white fluid from the lower body not only stains clothing but also emits a peculiar odor, posing a significant hygiene hazard.</p>
<p>"Car-Shedine Vaginal Tablets" are highly effective for leukorrhea. They cleanse internal secretions, resist external bacteria, relieve pain, and reduce inflammation. They are suitable for both long-standing and newly onset conditions. Before going to bed each night, insert one tablet deep into the vagina and wash it away in the morning. After several weeks of treatment, results are invariably achieved. There is no irritating effect during use. However, if the condition is caused by a husband's gonorrhea, "Gonacrine" can be taken internally to eliminate the internal gonococci. If it is caused by a weak body and incomplete development, "Feminol" can be taken concurrently. Taking these medications in combination will yield faster results. This medication can be used secretly at home without any adverse effects, making it particularly convenient. Therefore, this tablet has long been welcomed by women in Europe and America.</p>

<h3>Dr. Yao Juyan's Gonorrhea Lecture</h3>
<p>Clinic: Corner of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road; Clinic Hours: 10 AM to 6 PM; Gonorrhea Easily Confused with Hemorrhoids</p>
<p>Hemorrhoids are a disease of the anal region, originally unrelated to gonorrhea. However, many gonorrhea patients are unaware of the changes in their condition. What is actually a sequela of gonorrhea is mistaken for a new illness. Old diseases are not gone, and new diseases arise. This causes anxiety and panic, leading to constant worry and allowing gonococci to seize the opportunity to worsen the condition. This is an extremely dangerous mistake. Many people believe they have hemorrhoids when they actually have rectal gonorrhea. This condition often arises from the contamination of the anal mucosa by gonococcal secretions or from prostatitis and seminal vesicle abscesses. The symptoms include redness around the anus and the discharge of yellow pus. Later, bleeding and erosion often occur, and the anus narrows due to ulceration, eventually making it impossible to defecate. The more dirt that accumulates, the more gonococci there are, and the greater the danger. If treatment is not appropriate, the anus may be left with hard nodules, causing it to lose its elasticity and become constricted.</p>
<p>Patients often ignore these symptoms, so they are often referred to me by hemorrhoid specialists. Most of the patients I encounter have severely ulcerated anuses with pus flowing freely. I treat them by washing the area with medication, followed by suppositories and electrical therapy. At the same time, they take highly effective gonorrhea medications. After several weeks, the virus is greatly reduced, and after continuing the medication for several more weeks, they are completely cured. The anal area returns to normal. However, because of the dripping pus, this disease is easily transmitted to the opposite sex. Therefore, if the patient is married, his wife will definitely contract gonorrheal leukorrhea. She should use "Vaginal Tablets" externally as suppositories and take highly effective gonorrhea medications internally to eliminate the bacteria. Combining internal and external treatments will yield faster results.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Talks</h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>According to a Hankou telegram on the 26th, after the Guizhou Army began contact in Qi on the 24th, the situation along the Xiang River between Qi and Heng became increasingly tense. Today, newspapers reported that the Guizhou Army attacked Hengcheng, but the garrison did not return fire. The situation in Hunan Province is fluctuating, and it is difficult to predict what is hidden within. However, in this state of war clouds, bloodshed is likely inevitable. Recalling after the September 18th Incident, the Japanese loudly advocated the policy of "using Chinese to control Chinese." Unexpectedly, our country is re-enacting this scenario, and one cannot help but admire the intelligence of the Japanese.</p>
<p>Regarding the incident in which the Japanese ship Daiei Maru opened fire at Qikou, colliding with a customs anti-smuggling patrol boat, the Japanese military spokesman Ishii, when meeting with Chinese newspaper reporters the other day, claimed that the Qikou incident was caused by a misunderstanding. At that time, the Japanese ship mistakenly identified the customs patrol boat as a pirate ship, leading to both sides opening fire. According to Ishii, the Daiei Maru incident was entirely caused by a Japanese misunderstanding. Because the Japanese ship mistook the customs patrol boat for pirates, it opened fire. Therefore, the responsibility for this misunderstanding should fall on the Japanese side. However, Arida has ordered Kawagoe to make serious protests to me and dispatched two destroyers to Qingdao for security. It is truly a case of the male cat not howling, but the female cat howling, leaving one sighing with lament.</p>
<p>Chairman Han of the Shandong Provincial Government, the other day, summoned local newspaper reporters to talk, urging them to talk less about international affairs to avoid causing major disputes and instability. He stated that the press should always think about the people. This is Chairman Han's effort to endure humiliation and bear the burden, which one cannot help but admire. In fact, the more one fears causing disputes, the more disputes arise. The more one fears instability, the more instability there is. The Japanese authorities, seeing this point, use both "waterfowl diplomacy" and military deterrence, a two-pronged approach, to achieve their long-held wishes and goals. Therefore, Chairman Han's statement that the press should always think about the people and not cause disputes is truly incomprehensible.</p>
<p>The French-language Shanghai Daily reported that the number of Chinese people going to Japan for summer vacation this year has suddenly increased, exceeding 5,000. It is said that the cabins of a certain American shipping company have already been fully booked. Therefore, according to the estimate of the Japan Tourism Bureau, there will be 40,000 to 50,000 Chinese people traveling to Japan this summer. The Japanese say that this is a good phenomenon for Sino-Japanese friendship. When I hear this, I feel very sad. I wonder how the gentlemen who go to Japan for summer vacation will feel when they hear this?</p>
<p>The story of Wu Airong and her deaf-mute lover Lin Jimu's passionate love affair, due to parental opposition, even led to a court appearance. In the end, the love of parents could not overcome the love of lovers, resulting in the two being joined in marriage. This romantic tale was widely admired by society. It was said that such a marriage was the result of painstaking effort, the crystallization of dripping water and freezing cold, and a happy marriage that would surely last a lifetime, which is the most reliable. Unexpectedly, after only a few years, a scandalous child was born, and Airong's attitude suddenly changed. She once told her neighbors that she "must achieve the purpose of divorce, no matter what." When she was in love, no matter how much her parents advised her, she insisted on reaching the goal of marriage. No matter what, she could not be stopped. It is truly a case of "why today, if there was a yesterday?" The unreliability of the human heart is evident here, and the unreliability of love is also evident. Young men and women must be careful not to be fooled.</p>
<h3>Fan</h3>
<p>— Leng Yan</p>
<p>Just bought a fan, a black paper folding fan, not quite a city foot in length, maybe six and a half inches or less. Besides the large ribs, it has twenty-six small ribs.</p>
<p>I'm probably still obsessed with old things, very deeply so. I have an almost supra-material fondness for this small folding fan. To use a trendy phrase, it's under this folding fan that I've had many dreams, many beautiful and old-fashioned dreams.</p>
<p>I restrain myself, I won't talk about all these dreams. Here I will only talk about things related to the fan.</p>
<p>The first time I decided to use a folding fan was when I was twelve. Before that, I only used a banana leaf fan to swat dragonflies. That folding fan was about the same length as this one, and the small ribs were about the same too, but the fan surface wasn't black. One side was printed with green and blue landscapes, and the other side was densely covered with tiny fly-head calligraphy, Bai Juyi's "Song of Everlasting Regret." At that time, I could already discuss the "Song of Everlasting Regret," so I deeply loved this folding fan.</p>
<p>In our area, women don't use folding fans. Older women use banana leaf fans, younger women use very fine cattail leaf fans, and what about young girls? They probably use round fans.</p>
<p>Naturally, there aren't any very fancy round fans in the countryside, so the ones they have are usually made of white gauze, at most painted with sparse flowers. When I was fifteen, I suddenly felt the beauty of round fans, so I went and got one too, pure white, without any flowers. Why didn't I use flowers? Too girlish, afraid people would laugh. I used this round fan for two years. At sixteen, I wrote two lines by Li Yishan on it and gave it to a female friend: "The fan is cut from the moon's orb, too shy to cover her face; The carriage rolls like thunder, words cannot be exchanged." The second line isn't exactly right, but because the first line has the word "fan," I just wrote it down randomly.</p>
<p>After that, I only used folding fans until now. I always buy one or two every year.</p>
<p>Lu You's poem: "Do you know the recent events in Wu? Every family uses Su Dongpo's round fan." This was something that Su Dongpo was very proud of. Green willows leaning on the road, a small pavilion next to a stream. Whenever "the setting sun is right where the misty willows break one's heart," a beautiful woman leans on the window gazing idly, "idly holding a light white silk fan, her fair hand momentarily like jade." This scene is really hard to say whether it's poetry or painting!</p>
<p>Before the Song Dynasty, there were no folding fans. In the early Yuan Dynasty, envoys from the southeastern barbarians held gathered-head fans, and people laughed at them. Gathered-head fans are folding fans. By the early Ming Dynasty, folding fans were very popular because "they are very convenient to carry in one's sleeves." But precisely because they are convenient, they are easily lost. Ancient folding fans were large, so it didn't matter as much. Small folding fans like the one I just bought are always being lost.</p>
<p>Round fans are naturally round: "Cut into a fan of conjugal bliss, round like the bright moon." But there are also hexagonal fans. Wang Xizhi wrote about an old woman's hexagonal fan.</p>
<p>When folded, folding fans don't look like much, but when unfolded, they are really very beautiful, especially their patterns and styles, which please me. The old-fashioned lattice fan surfaces, desk shapes, and ice plum patterns, etc. Recently, the dance film by Mei Lai Wu often made the background of a scene into a fan shape.</p>
<p>It is said that fans were really popular in all seasons in the Ming Dynasty, unlike now, when they are only used in the summer. The Ming Dynasty used folding fans because they were "very convenient to carry in one's sleeves," so they could be kept in hand all year round. Things like silk fans are not suitable. "Silk fans are discarded in autumn," isn't that a very old idiom?</p>
<p>Everything in Shanghai is progressing, especially things used by women. Even just talking about folding fans, in the past there were some made of beautiful feathers. But "fans" made of feathers have existed since ancient times: "During the time of King Zhao of Zhou, magpie wings were gathered to make fans. During the Han Dynasty, chariots used pheasant tail fans. Zhuge Wuhou and Wu Meng both held white feather fans. Yu Yi presented a feather fan to Emperor Wu of Jin." But folding fans made of feathers are a recent product.</p>
<p>The original meaning of a fan is nothing more than to create wind and block objects, but later the fan became an ornament. Many fans are not very convenient for cooling off, like the one I just bought, which is not for cooling off.</p>
<p>On a small folding fan, I had many dreams, many beautiful and old-fashioned dreams. When will these dreams come true? So I thought of a small gold-flecked folding fan, that folding fan with light blue "tassels" and a small white jade fan pendant.</p>

<h3>Reading "Ten Records of Southern Travels" (Part Two)</h3>
<p>Before I introduce this "Ten Records of Southern Travels," I want to bring up "reportage literature," which someone in the literary world has been vigorously advocating recently. So-called "reportage literature" is based on facts observed by the author, using a political and economic perspective to make a critical report on what they see. In this kind of "reportage literature," the author should strongly point out the persecution by imperialists, the ugliness of the ruling class, and the truest aspects of current society.</p>
<p>And what about "Ten Records of Southern Travels"? The author grasps this theme to write this travelogue. Especially in the ninth record, "Macau Zhongshan," and the tenth record, "Hong Kong Travel and Observation," the author not only points out the social recession, but also the persecution given to these two places by the imperialists.</p>
<p>This travelogue contains a total of ten travel records, and their titles are: First Record, "The Joy of River Travel"; Second Record, "One Day in Changsha"; Third Record, "The Big Tree of Luhuo"; Fourth Record, "Ascending Mount Heng"; Fifth Record, "What I Saw and Heard in Hengyang"; Sixth Record, "Chen Mountain and Chen Water"; Seventh Record, "Mountain and Water Bridge Cave"; Eighth Record, "Famous Scenic Spots in Guangzhou"; Ninth Record, "Macau Zhongshan"; Tenth Record, "Hong Kong Travel and Observation."</p>
<p>In addition to these ten travel records, there are also ten communications published by the author in the "Shen Bao" during the journey, titled "Notes on Traveling Between Han and Yue," because they were written in classical Chinese, the narrative is relatively simple.</p>
<p>Regarding the author's motivation for traveling south, the author writes very clearly in the "Preface," he said: "The important task of my trip to the South was to visit the construction of the Zhushao section of the Guangdong-Han Railway. The journey started from Shanghai, took a train to Beijing, changed to a Yangtze River steamer to Hankou, crossed the river, and went south along the Guangdong-Han Railway from Xujiapeng, Wuchang. Places that were inspected along the way, such as Changsha, Zhuzhou, Lukou, Mount Heng, Hengshan, Hengyang, Chenzhou, Yizhang, Pingshi, Lechang, Guangzhou, etc...." In addition to the travelogue, each place is accompanied by illustrations. These landscape photos with strong local characteristics do indeed increase the reader's interest a lot.</p>
<h3>Ke</h3>
<p>— Xu Ji</p>
<p>Near dusk, a grayish-yellow sky sparsely drizzled with "cattle hair rain." At the back door of the Wang residence, the "Great Wall Gate" next to Early Bridge, single and desolate small firecrackers crackled. Then, two coolies silently carried a thin white wooden coffin, quietly came out of the narrow back door, and laboriously walked toward the desolate, twilight countryside. Thus, Lin Di's mother, who had been waiting since early morning, blocked by the doorman of the "Wang Mansion" from entering, began to cry out in a broken, hoarse voice of fifty-six years old, like an explosion. Her cries drifted far away, saturated with an indescribable resentment and the heavy sorrow of life. Three strings of paper money burned alone on the muddy ground outside the door, using weak, powerless flames to lick the thin paper ashes. The fine rain drizzled down, and in a wisp of light smoke, the flames turned a ghastly green, shining terribly among the paper ashes, and then went out silently! Everything became so silent. The two monks, whom Lin Di's mother had summoned from the town for seventy copper coins, wearing old, tattered yellow robes, chanted the "Wrong Rebirth Mantra" forty-nine times in front of the paper ash, out of tune and in a low voice. After chanting, thinking of the young Lin Di lying in the coffin, thinking of the unfortunate life of a small creature, which they had heard from Lin Di's mother, they each silently prayed in their hearts with an indescribable sorrow: "May the dead quickly be reborn in bliss, and go on to have a good life, and may the living live well," they slowly followed the coffin with Lin Di's mother, and said to the crazed fifty-six-year-old woman in an awkward, unfamiliar tone: "Lin Di's mother, you should see through things a bit? The gentlemen and ladies of the great families are always like that, always blaming Lin Di for her bitter fate, it's all predestined, there's nothing to be done. You are also over fifty, your own health is important. The dead are already dead, all the crying is useless. Okay, don't be so sad..."</p>
<p>But after people mentioned it like that, an indescribable emotion bubbled up again. Her heart was filled with a sour and bitter feeling, mixed with hatred, regret, longing... all the sorrows of the human world blended together in her heart, and tears welled up like a spring. Then she cried even louder. "Why am I still alive! I... yes, it was my fault after all. I let the Wang family force my seventeen-year-old daughter to be a concubine to pay off an old debt of fifty yuan. When she left, Lin Di said: 'I'm afraid I won't see Mom again this time...' But who knew? The eldest son of the Wang family pestered her day and night, treating her like an object, a different kind of creature..."</p>
<p>The coffin swayed in front, the carriers panted and wheezed, and the countryside gradually darkened. It was dusk.</p>
<p>Lin Di's mother's hoarse cries gradually became weak and faint. The suffering she had endured plunged her into a semi-conscious state, and the tragic memories of her dead daughter vaguely surfaced:</p>
<p>"As a result, she was finally violated like a machine, and I wasn't even allowed to visit her. Only a month after she went, she secretly came to me to cry for an afternoon..."</p>
<p>"Life is so bitter." The days passed in cruelty and tears. Then "the eldest young master" contracted consumption during those days of indulgence and died.</p>
<p>The first wife jumped up like a madwoman, saying to everyone: "That vixen is good, she killed him!" The rest of the clan also believed it, saying that Lin Di's life was too hard, and she had "ke" (countered) the man to death.</p>
<p>"Family-destroying spirit!" So, the first wife beat and scolded her every day, and the large, seventy-five-year-old "old lady" also tore at her hair: "Family-countering star, you go die, you..."</p>
<p>Beating and scolding. When whipping, they used rattan, didn't give her food, and locked her in a small room for three days.</p>
<p>"Vixen! Family-countering spirit! Killed the man..."</p>
<p>How Lin Di cried, it was unimaginable. News came out that Lin Di was half dead from being tormented, but it had been ordered from above that her old mother was not allowed to see her.</p>
<p>When she was released on the fourth day, she was already exhausted beyond recognition. Dazed, she just jumped into the well in the backyard...</p>
<p>A thin coffin quietly held an unfortunate fate. Now, she lay quietly, she would never "ke" anyone to death again. Her fate revealed its final chapter, and dragging behind this chapter was only the tear-streaked face of a fifty-six-year-old woman.</p>
<h3>Flower Drum Opera</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>What Shanghai people call Shen Opera is called Flower Drum Opera in our countryside, and some people call it Dongxiang Tune.</p>
<p>I think Flower Drum Opera is the most popular kind of drama in the countryside because the dialogue and singing are all in the local dialect, and everything can be understood. People who are used to listening to Flower Drum Opera can recite the plot, and the singing is just like northerners being able to hum a few lines of Peking Opera. Everyone can sing a few lines.</p>
<p>The people who sing Flower Drum Opera also have roles of Sheng (male), Dan (female), Chou (clown), Lao Dan (old woman), etc. Including the erhu player, drum beater, and gong player, about ten people are enough to form a very complete troupe. Besides the erhu, gongs, and drums, they only have a combing basket, and the costumes are usually borrowed from the village where the performance is taking place.</p>
<p>The people in the countryside feel that their lives are too monotonous and want to find some entertainment, so Flower Drum Opera doesn't cost much, and the dialogue and singing can all be understood. It is the most popular kind of drama, so they collect a few yuan from each household in their village and invite a troupe of Flower Drum Opera to sing. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Yuan Chang (1120) 12:45 AM</p>
<p>Opening Chapter "National Hero" (by Gao Yangshan): Discussing the ups and downs of the situation. National morale is declining and foreign powers are strong. China originated in Kunlun. Eastern migration started from Xia Yu and Shang. The Zhou Dynasty lasted eight hundred years. The royal family was granted lands in all four directions. The Central Plains of China gradually expanded. The Yi, Man, Rong, and Di were relegated to the wilderness. There were many miracles in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. Qin Shihuang swallowed up everything. His tyranny was excessive, a true autocracy. Chen Sheng and Wu Guang's rebellion began with the slaying of a snake. They pleaded for the people and destroyed Qin. (Relying on) Han Xin, Xiao He, and Zhang Liang. The Emperor Zhao inherited the throne after five generations. (At that time) the eastern bandits were very strong. Raping, plundering, there was no crime they did not commit. The coastal residents had no peace. Fertile land became a wasteland. The plains were desolate. The national hero rose in time. Huo Guang was appointed as a general and prime minister. (He killed them so that) ships were wrecked, masts were broken, heads fell, and their spirits fled to the sea. From then on, the border people enjoyed peace and prosperity. General's Temple has been built at coast areas. The name of the Great General has been passed far and wide. His fame will last for ten thousand generations.</p>

She pours Shuangxi Soda to show hospitality. The sweet and delicious taste pleases her. The next morning, the sky is clear and the sun is bright. They will happily stroll in the Grand View Garden. Climbing high at Qinfang Pavilion. The entire garden can be seen. Granny is so happy she chants Buddha's name. Saying, I am lucky to visit Fairyland. Walking to Xiaoxiang Pavilion with bamboos on two sides. The narrow path lead to the inside. The ground is covered with moss and slippery. Granny falls down like planting a green onion. Sitting at Cui Xiaotang. Sister Feng is tricky, cunning. She gave her square chopsticks that are very clumsy. Granny said, like iron tools, not exquisite. Making everyone laugh. The servants are serving dishes. Sister Feng chooses pigeon egg. She insisted that Granny to eat. Granny said, my ration is bigger than a plowing cattle. Only a sow can fill me up. Xiangyun spits out tea and laugh. Everyone is turning red. After the meal, they went boating on the river. Gently swinging boats send breeze. Visiting Cuijin Pavilion again. Granny drinks happily. At the archway of the Villa to Greet Relatives. Granny says, I almost worshiped the Jade Emperor Palace. Her belly is upset. She wants to relieve herself here. Sister Feng laugh. The maids guide her to the toilet and return. Granny forgot the way. She walks in a moon door and enters a room. Seeing those colorful ladies. The person inside the mirror tries to touch the emptiness. Seeing the clean bed and the folded embroidered quilt. She said, relaxing here is great. She falls asleep as she touches the pillow. Sleeping in Yihong Court. This is because she has not seen much.</p>
