<h3>出超入超及我國出入超的檢討（下）</h3>
<p>— 羅敦偉</p>
<p>——在中央廣播電台講演——</p>
<p>第一，先就對我國貿易的幾個主要國家看看：我國近代式的國際貿易，雖然以葡萄牙西班牙為最早，可是正規的設立機關保護貿易的，還首推英國。英國在一六八四年即得到清廷的許可，在廣州設立商館，正式通商。鴉片戰爭以後，締結南京條約，獲得香港的割讓和吾通商的便利，英國對我貿易，更是蒸蒸日上。後來，天津，烟台，緬甸，西藏各種不平等條節之成立，英國的商務勢力，可以說獨霸東亞。日本在甲午之戰以後，朝鮮獨立（那個時候是獨立的），台灣，澎湖列島的獲得，對我國的貿易也突飛猛進。後來再經日俄之戰，吞併朝鮮，便可以和英國爭衡。歐戰中間，乘各國沒有餘力顧到東亞，更是獨霸一時，對華貿易於第一位。歐戰結束以後，美國因為大戰的關係，由債務國轉為債權國，經濟方面所謂『永久的繁榮』，在世界都到處到勢，而對我國的貿易上面也奪得了第一位的地位。日本只好退居第二位。（附表）</p>
<p>第二，現在來討論出入口的商品：　我國重要人口商品，最初本以鴉片及呢絨布疋五金為大宗。以後英國棉織品入口增加，一八七〇年棉貨疋頭輸入佔我進口總值百分之一。直到歐洲大戰之先，英國對我輸入物品始終以棉貨為最多。因此把我國農業中間的男耕女織之『女織』一個基本工作打倒了，自然在農村中間發生了一個重大的威脅。民國初元以來，國際帝國主義，對我的經濟侵略，可以說無孔不入，因而輸入的物品也就特別的復雜，差不多什麼東西都有。近年來連死人的棺材都有了；諸位所看見過的殯儀館的外國式的鋼棺材，即是用舶來品材料做成的。尤其可注意的，即是近年來糧食進口的加多，和農產品出口的減少。民國二十二年米麥進口總值快到二萬萬元。現在每年糧食進口數目還是很大。棉花的進口，更不用說也非常之大。民國二十一年居第一位，達一八〇、七八二、九九七元〇由是我國經濟其本條件中的『男耕』，又受了威脅。出口方面，更是危險。我國出口方面，素來以絲茶為大宗；大荳也為數不少。最初絲茶二項，即佔輸出品總值百分之八十。後來因為日本法國的絲茶競爭，一八九八年即退至百分之五十，近年來更是不堪。大荳在出口商品中間，近年來為數很大，有時居出口商品中的第。『九一八』事變以後，情形完全變更；二十二年轉為入超。最近因為桐油輸出的增多，現象雖然好一點，可是截至現在為止，絲茶的出口還沒有什麼大的轉機。而且，最近我研究入口的奢侈品，發現每年菸酒等項鞭品的入口數目竟是很大。普通每年總在四千萬元左右，而就中以菸草進口最大。二十二年佔一千九百多萬元，二十三年佔一千四百多萬元。這些說明，都處處表現我國經濟病態的嚴重，所以大家應該特別注意。</p>
<p>第三，不妨來研究我國入超抵補的方法；我國貿易入超數目非常之大：即以最近五年而論，也超過了三十一億元以上的白銀，　能抵補這五年的入超。可是事實上民國成立以來，每年白銀入口總是多於出口，即是入超。最近五年來民國二十一，二十二兩年還是入超；二十二，二十三，二十四三年　　出超。可是為數還是有限。即加上白銀的私運，也不算十分的多。無論如何和上述的三十一億元比相差很遠。因此據一般研究，我國抵補入超的方法，大約有下列各種：　外人在華文化經費；　外人來華遊覽費用；　各國駐華軍隊費用；　外人在華投資；　華僑匯欵。在上面五種的抵補方式中間，一·二·三·三種為數非常之少。而且第三種於我國有大妨碍。第四種過去運用外資的方式不對，也恰恰助長帝國主義的侵略。於我國有好處而正當的抵補方式，祇有第五種華僑匯欵。不錯，華僑匯欵，在我國國際平衡上實在是一個主要的抵補方式，這是大家所知道的。但是確實的數目究有多少，也沒有一致的估計。莫斯博士（Dr.　Morse）在一九〇三年估為一萬一千萬元。雷瑪爾（Remer）據　親　的調查，估計一九二八，一九二九，一九三〇年每年平均三萬萬元左右。近五年來，中國銀行對於華僑匯欵都有估計；最低是二萬萬元，最高遇達三萬九千萬元。最高為一九三一年，最低為一九三三年，近兩年也都在二萬九千萬元左右。最近興承禧先生在中山文化教育館專刊上發表一篇估計，估計五年來華僑匯欵，一九三一年遠四萬萬元以上；一九三二年有三萬萬二千萬元；一九三三年三萬零五百萬元；一九三四年落至二萬五千萬元；一九三五年又為三萬一千六百萬元。各家估計雖有大小不同，而每年華僑匯欵，平均總在三萬萬元左右，大約有相當的確實性。再加以上面各種抵補方式，每年當在五萬萬元左右。由此說來，似乎　萬萬元的入超也可以相抵。要知除此以外，每年僅付外債便約需一萬萬元；軍需品的購入及留學生的遺派，大約每年在五千一萬左右。所以中國國際收支的抵補，還成一個問題。最嚴切值得注意的，上面各抵補方式的中間，祇有華僑匯欵一項是一種健全的方法。而這個健全的方法，因為海外華僑到處受人排斥以及其他政治的經濟的原因，華僑匯欵已逐年減少，更使我們覺得這個抵補問題的嚴重。</p>
<p>由上面各點的說明，我們可以知道入超在理論上固然不一定對國家有碍，可是我國國際貿易的入超，第一因為數目太大，而且無法抵補；第二因為入口商品都是日用必需的消費物品以及奢侈物品，生產工具反倒很少；無論就那一個方面講，對於整個的民族經濟，不能不說是一個促進崩潰的徵兆。所以我們雖不能一律不用外貨，總希望大家注意實業部吳部長的『生產工具歡迎外貨，消費物品必用國貨』的主張。（完）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>中國合作學社年會開幕</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>中國合作運動發生於十七年前。薛仙舟先生所創辦之國民合作儲蓄銀行平民學社。為其　矢。國民黨秉政以來。允亟亟於合作事業之推行。以蔪分配之社會化。合作旣列為七大運動之一。中國合作學社又得陳果夫王世頴諸君之提倡。而組織成立。該社以調查研究提倡指導合作事業為職志。成立於今將及八載。社員自二十二人增至四百三十六人。事業則為發行合作月刋。灌輸合作學識。指導合作進行。設立仙舟圖書館。儲藏合作書籍。合組合作人員訓練班。推行合作事業。凡此犖犖數者。巳見其工作之緊張。迺者合作學社五屆年會舉行於長沙。各社員本其平素研究之所得。當可乘此機會。有不少之新貢獻矣。</p>
<p>惟是一事業一制度之推行。必有其素養。從而因勢利導之。其勢順。督促淬勵。相率以敎。期與化成者。其勢艱。合作事業在中國。似無此素養。然如合會。固亦信用之合作也。社倉則防荒之合作也。社學則敎育之合作也。守望相助。則保衛之合作也。鄉間舉行之土地會（里社之會集）。一地方事業之合作也。惟其組織粗疏。雖有規的以資遵守。不合於現在人事複雜之時代。故居今而談合作事業。舊有制度事業寓有合作精神者應糾正其缺陷。發揮其特性。新的方面之當灌輸者。作深入之宣傳博。大衆之同情。雙方並進。新舊兼蓄。雖於籌劃之際。容多勞費。然於推行之時必易奏效也。</p>
<p>目前最感需要者為如何復興農村。世之談複興者。往往就農村而言農村。不察其為整個經濟問題。非局部治療所能見效。惟今年農產物價如黃豆。芝蔴小麥菜籽。棉花無一不貴。農民收入自較往年為豐。生活亦必較往年為裕。同時米穀復慶大有。是誠農村好轉之機會。而所焦慮者則為如何保持其產物。得善價而沽諸。誠能為之謀儲藏。籌運銷。授以合作之組織。與以經濟上之援助。指導之使其有成功之希望。農民自無有不樂於從事之理。在昔中國合作學社指導光福寺區之合作事業。成效昭著。甚望其擴而廣之。推及於各處也。</p>
<p>農村放欵甚囂塵上。農民實惠能有幾何。此其間在放欵者固亦有其難處。但如不脫剝削式之範疇。則與運販高利貸者之所為有以異乎。夫農民今日所最威困難者。為經濟上之挹注週轉。舊有之合會制度。自經農村破產而十有九倒。高利貸因有害淤農民。而自打倒。高利貸之聲浪愈高。農民借錢之途徑愈仄。典當自市面凋敝以來。典質之物又故貶其値。農民至是欲求生產而不得。欲求消費亦無着。此種情形。至今猶未消釋。故為農民人事方面。不為之同時規畫補救。則所謂用之於生產者亦屬徒然。又如農村借欵以復興農村為職志。而無中介之組織。進行又豈能盡利。是則補偏教弊。以利農民。又非中國合作學社研究提倡不為功也。</p>
<p>吾人以為合作事業功效不北此。民間組織散漫。無可諱言。私而忘公。亦所難免。而合作事業之推進。實可完密其組織。改善其生活。健全其經濟。此允中國合作學社所當努力者也。</p>

<p>慕尼黑　匈牙利總理兼陸軍部長貢博斯將軍、今日在此問附近某療養院病卒、享年四十有九、將軍於近七年中為匈牙利强有力之人物、反對之者目之為國社黨、將軍雖竭力否認擬施行狄克推多制、但殊欽佩墨索里尼與希特勒之政治手腕而不自諱、赴德數决後、與人談話時、輒稱道希氏不置、將軍為貧村中校長之子畢業軍校後、供職克羅蒂亞步兵聯隊中、一九一四年歐戰發作時、任柴柯里白軍團參謀、以有功獲三等勳章、一九一六年俄軍夜攻之際、受傷而回匈京、旣愈供職陸軍部、繼奉命赴維也納、當時曾著小冊、題曰「匈牙利陸軍」主張編練獨立之匈軍、一九一八年匈牙利革命、奉命返京、嗣因熟諳外國語文、赴柴格里白任陸軍委員、是年杪、復返京、在陸軍部主管所謂「巴爾幹團」、以反對當時總統加羅爾伊伯爵之故、而於翌年布爾希維克黨秉政之際、名列退役軍官册、嗣逃維也納、出一反革命報、名匈牙利郵報、未幾赴反革命之「白軍」所在地齊巨特、而任白軍政府陸軍决長、旋為法國壓迫而離該地、正在赴維也納旅途中、接匈牙利紅治傾覆消息、卽復入匈陸軍任某職、翌年、卽一九二〇年、被舉為國會議員、一九二九年任陸軍部長、至死始已、後一年、擢陞上將、一九三二年掌揆席、曾以修正和的為政府程序之一部分、其政策謀以德意波蘭奧地里亞匈牙利五國成一新集團、將軍近患心臟病、本擬於今日辭職、但未及提出辭呈、卽與世長辭矣、（六日路透電）</p>
<h3>意幣實行貶值　德匈表示不滿　意決定發行特種公債　開發阿比西尼亞富源　畢德門擁護貨幣協定</h3>
<p>（羅馬）　國務會議昨日决定貶低幣値時所當勵行各項辦法、其第一項載明房產業主、因不受貨幣貶値影響、應卽認購公倆、其數額等於房產價値百分之五、關於此層、負責人士頃官稱、政府頃已決定、發行特種公債、卽由各房產業主認購、而以之開發阿比西尼亞富源、充實本國防經費、並徵收房產種稅、以為此項公債、還本付息之用云、（六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）　意幣里拉貶値之後　匯兌市塲業已暫停交易、茲已定於明晨復業、此外、貶値辦法實行之後、意國與他國間原有抵賬協定、均已自動停止效力、此後應按照里拉新匯率、加以運用、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）　政府自决定貶低里拉價値之後、當卽通知羅馬協定其他兩簽字國、卽奧匈兩國、並謂政府對於奧匈兩國與意國之相互貿易、仍當予以維持、而促其發展云、（六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　此間金融界聞意幣里拉貶値之消息、均不以為奇、蓋日前意國政府宣佈於本日舉行國務會議、時此間金融界卽已預料將有里拉貶値之舉、今果不出所料、又此間經濟人士、則以為意國此舉「或有助於和平」、蓋由此可見意相墨索里尼意欲參加國際共同之努力、由各國相互協調、以發展國際貿易、誠若是、則共影響於一般局勢、當必甚鉅大也、抑意國國外貿易、前因政府採取特殊措置、頗受限制、今後里拉貶價、輸出貿易自可大增云、（五日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　意國貶低貨幣曁减低進口稅之後、此間人士甚為驚異、並為之不，安、負責人士頃宣稱、德國輸往意國貨物、除媒斤一項而外、其餘多係製成品、今茲意國雖减低原料品與糧食之進口稅、實於德國出口業、無所裨益、此外、德國經濟政策、原以自給自足主義為依據、而由政府用獨裁權力、予以推行、乃得維持健全經濟制制度、茲意國又已貶低貨幣、則各大工業國中、維持貨幣現行價値者、僅餘德國一國、其所推行之經濟政策、勢成孤立、因而在精神上、感受打擊云、（六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（維也納）　意國政府實行貶低貨幣之後、當卽通知奧匈兩國、願與各該國繼續密切合作、此間政界人士對於此項聲明、極表好戚、並謂意奧匈三國外交部長、卞月初在此間所當舉行之會議、其性質因而愈形重要、此外、財政部長特拉斯婁曾於昨晚與國家銀行總裁基恩博克、討論國際貨幣新局勢、據政界人士預測、奧國工商兩界、雖多主張奧幣先令、亦當貶値、恐難成為事實、特政府或當採取若干項補救辦法、如津貼出口、减低進口稅之類云、六日哈瓦社電）</p>
<p>匈牙利京城　意國貨幣貶値之舉、可使匈國遭受重大打擊、貨緣匈牙利物、輸往意國者、數甚多、對於意國、因而處於債權地位、今茲意幣貶値之後意匈兩國棧賬事業、已自動停頓、影響所及、意國向匈牙利所購貨物、自必為之减少故也、此間政界人士以為、意國政府雖已聲明、務當維持對匈貿易、並促其發展、但該國幣値貶低辦法、對於匈牙利若果發生不利影響、則匈國惟有轉向德國、設法發展貿易、以為亡羊補牢之計云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（紐約）　美國參議院外交委員會主席畢德門、頃發表宣言謂『英法美三國貨幣協定簽訂、為羅斯福總統任內之最大政績、此項協定簽訂後、並無在國會通過新法律之必要』云、畢德門又謂、當一九三三年倫敦會議開會時、各國貨幣匯率、尙無穩定之可能、蓋其時英國不願提高英鎊匯率、而法國亦拒絕法郞貶値、故一般空氣、殊為不利、共和黨藉此責難羅斯福總統、謂倫敦經濟會議之失敗、常由羅斯福負其主要責任、實可謂不平之至、卽據美國聯邦準備銀行哈禮遜之估計、在當時各國貨幣、亦無穩定之可能云、（五日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　政府官員今日表示意見、謂意國减低幣價可以增如英法美三國貨幣協定之效力、以大體論、此舉可認為恢複國际幣價至戰後初期比例之又一步驟云、（五日國民社電）</p>

<p>瑪德里　據未證實消息、政府軍包攻奧維陀已一月之久、現巳佔領該城、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>安達易　政府軍今日向奧維陀投彈　四百二十枚、發砲八百饗、為內戰以來最猛烈之轟炸、然叛軍電台仍稱奧維陀尙在叛軍手中、否認阿斯多利亞礦工已佔領該城之說、（五日國民電）</p>

<p>靑島通訊、我國旅外僑胞、年來因受外族排斥、被逐回國者、日有所聞、現在旅居海參崴之僑胞、又被驅逐回國、昨日由烟台乘輪來靑之難僑十餘人、均年在五十以外、最老者名于培財、年七十五歲、抵靑後、因人地生疏、無人收留、徘徊街市、情極可憫、經公安第一分局第十派出所警士瞥見、當卽帶所詢問、知為旅居海參崴被驅逐之僑胞、當送至泰安路泰和棧過宿、並允代向社會局請求救濟、據談被驅逐情形、極為慘酷、茲將難僑之談話誌决、在二十年前赴關東謀生、那時是山東人最盛行的事、一般少年人莫不爭先恐後北渡、的確那時赴關東的人是頂發財的、我們去的時候、均在二十左右、每年總到捎家裏二三百元上下、不料自九一八事變後、我們就無法再混了、甚麽捐啦稅啦·保啦·眞麻煩死人、這還不算、最要命的、就是無緣無故的給你加上一個罪名、輕則下大獄、重則槍斃、原來一天可掙一元錢左右、自事變後、直减到三角以下、除去納捐納稅、簡直是每飯不飽、因為沒法、我們轉到了俄國海參崴、初到的時候、還容易掙錢、每天也可以賺兩三元錢、後來聽說被什麽黨佔據了、待遇華僑極為慘酷、我們簡直又入了牢籠、工錢不但是减少大半、而且所賺的錢、必須當日化盡、不准有餘錢、我們出外謀生、家中誰無父母妻子、那一個不想積存下幾個錢帶回家中、奇怪的很、只要是你有綫、必定被他們翻出、結果是下大獄、十年二十年他們隨便規定、因此我們中國人在海參崴坐獄者、不下數十萬人、這還不要緊、自從今年春天起、他們高低不要中國人了、你正在工作的時候、他們就會牽着你的耳朶呌你走、無論銀錢行李、一槪不准携帶、每天必有數千的中國人、就忽然的無家可歸、說起來眞是可憐人、幸虧我們那裏有領事官、才設法將我們送回、本來該從東三省經過回國、奈偽國所定法律甚嚴、若無護照通過該處、遇見就要槍斃、所以領事就呌我們往海參崴直到上海、是每月兩决、每决可運送五百餘人、現在被逐回國者、已不下數萬人、我們到上海後、因為是山東人、所以上海公安局又打發我們乘輪到烟台、这次到烟台的有五十餘人、我們因為距靑島甚近、所以烟台紅萬字會、又把我們送在茂利輪上、於今日（四日）下午三時到達靑島、昨天在烟台釭萬字會吃了頓飽飯、至今還禾吃飯、言下不勝唏噓</p>

<h3>陳濟堂與胡文虎</h3>
<p>— 徐舒</p>
<p>船到香港，又開了，碼頭上有許多送行的人，紅綠紙條掛遍了船沿；離這裏到新加坡是三天另一夜的旅程，八月三十日下午四時，就開始了。</p>
<p>船上頭等艙上多了二位中國的名人，那就是陳濟棠與胡文虎，前者是失敗的英雄，帶了許多錢去外國的；後者是得意的財主。是回新加坡老家去的。對於這兩位名人我有一些莫明的感慨。</p>
<p>快到新加坡的前日，學生們有一個集會，有人提議到新加坡時候，請胡文虎先生作一個指導，並且請他盡一點東道之誼，同時還想參觀他在星洲的事業。說句老實話，這羣初出茅廬的中國孩子，想請這位對於中國一切都非常熱心的華僑富翁破一點鈔。並且還想對於這位百業凋零，松柏猶存之偉人求一點認識的。</p>
<p>開會的消息傳到頭等艙，聽說陳將軍就疑作是一個反對他或是什麽的集會，很感不安，派人向各方打聽；這位在廣州不可一世的英雄，到這白色的船上對於五十個學生開會，發生恐心，這種心境不是我們所能了解，也不是國內的同胞所能了解的，我想。</p>
<p>向胡文虎先生接洽的手續，是先寫信給他，但等了二天沒有回信，於是只得再派代表去見他去，可是胡文虎先生很冷淡，首先說星洲沒有什麽可玩，第二是說時間侷促，他不能招待；反正不知道怎麽說法，這位胡先生只會廣東話，我們由廣東方言家才能同他通話，於是結果他說，假如不怎麽麻煩，他可能的時候，可以派夥計與大汽車來陪領。</p>
<p>可是星洲在第二天六時早晨到了，一直到九時，夥計與汽車都沒有來，什麽都沒有十分確定，誰肯耐心來等道靠不住的的會呢？</p>
<p>我們坐汽車到植物園，因預先沒有組織，人又多，沒有說好。忽忽到博物館，博物館原名是Raffles　Library　Sir　Thomas　StanfoodRafles是第一個新加坡的建設者，此館有點紀念他的性質，所以進門就是地的塑像</p>
<p>博物館搜羅東西極多，關於馬來人種的歷史文化等有價値的器械用　陳列得極齊備，馬來文化有許多地方極像中國，我們可以從許多東西比較出來，船隻武器很早就極發達，劍柄之彫刻，以及許多五金羅鈿等之製作，很早都瑧於完美之點。可是他們的人民，稍稍有知識的先進的都歐化起來，已沒有一點東方的個性了。</p>
<p>博物館出來，坐黃包車去吃飯，這裏黃包車是可坐兩人的。我與淸華大學的敎授趙人僑先生坐一輛，趙先生人雖胖些，但我可瘦，兩人坐下，猶嫌其太狹，我想這或者是專為一男一女而坐的。</p>
<p>吃中國飯是多數人的意見，五天沒有吃中國飯，他們都想吃了；在我可是還不需要，第一因為動身時許多人請我吃飯，餘味未散，第二因為我在北方住慣，愛吃麥食；這裏吃的怕只有廣東館子，廣東館子的飯我最怕，所以不感什麽與趣。</p>
<p>新加坡幣價要比香港貴一半，比上海自然更貴，我們人雖然多，但一不吃酒。二則揀經濟菜吃，可是還吃了十四元多，十四元合上海錢近三十元，在上海是可以好好吃一桌了。——這樣一想，也難怪胡文虎先生要不肯請此客的。</p>
<p>去的時候是汽車，在街上走過許多街，也經過胡文虎先生的家，胡先生的家是一所很好的洋房，但大門口內外上下飾有大小數隻洋灰的石製五彩的虎豹，虎下刻着胡文虎，豹下刻着胡文豹的名字，所以更加醒目。街上廣吿牌上都是萬金油老虎商標，偶而有汽車過來，車頂上也立有老虎，車篷上也是廣吿。可見胡文虎先生在星洲的地位了。</p>
<p>據知道的人說，胡先生是祖傳的在熱帶製賣中國秘方藥的華僑，常橡皮樹發財的當兒，許多人都投此機，而胡先生則毫不為動，仍舊一心一意致力萬金油買賣，年復一年，常許多橡皮業經營者破產的現在，他是更顯出財力的偉大了。</p>
<p>從街上走回來，我對於新加坡潔凈的市政起了一種難言的感槪。這一切歐化的建築佈置，早已沒有博物館裏古雅精緻馬來人之東方文化存在，而殘留在這英人治下的島上，可謂東方文化的表微的，只有胡文虎先生住宅牆頭公司車上，招牌紙上的簡陋的五彩虎豹吧了。在船上時，胡文虎先生是遇見過的，這位壯健的洋服翩翩的富商，來保住這個中國民間端午節應景商標，也的確是不容易了。</p>
<p>這裏帝國主義的經濟策略下，只有胡先生還不屈不撓的存在，實已是可驚的虎豹，可是萬金油只能在中國人馬來人印度人之間銀行：我對於這卓然的富商又有什麽感想呢？碼頭上都是中國小販之襯杉袴襪等的小攤，而一面大英帝國的軍艦則　立在港間，天，這是什麽時候？這已經是黃昏了，我憑在白色意輪的攔頭，不禁想念我遠迢迢的故國了。可是立刻又想起，這位胡文虎先生上岸後，宏大的富麗堂皇之頭等艙沙龍裏，怕只有陳將軍一行三四個中國人了吧？他們坐在甲板上向窗外遠矚，對這貧窮而落後故國，又將有什麽樣的感想？（一九三六，九，八，於印度洋途中）。</p>

<h3>參加世運歐游雜感足球錦標面面觀</h3>
<p>— 李惠堂</p>
<p>足球錦標比賽、在這一回的夏令配克大會也算是重要節目之一、而且比賽中的門劵收入、也佔大會財源的優越位置、單就最後在大會會塲中角逐那四次的比賽、觀衆巳近四十萬人、收入的肥沃可以槪見了、現在大會巳成明日黃花、足球錦標也有歸宿、但關於此項消息、報端所載多屬德文、我國所得的通話、也簡略不詳、這裏我且把我所見所聞所知的事實、靠我腦力的所及、補寫出來、諒關心球事的球國迷民們、也不厭煩地樂於一觀罷、</p>
<p>在這裏讓我先把全都足球錦標的結果製表出來、（三至六日）（七至八日）（十至十一）（十五日）（駐）另第三四名决賽挪　勝波蘭三比二、（十三日）×符號者表示延長時間</p>
<p>符號者表示此　秘魯本以四比二勝奧地利、以不合現定、判令重賽、秘魯不服、卒不出塲、奧地利白得複賽權</p>
<p>這回參加的單位共有十六國、錦標是取單循環的淘汰制、十六恰巧是圓活的數目、抽起籤來沒一國輪空、南美洲的勁旅像烏拉圭（上屆冠軍）阿根廷、都因砥觸業餘規則、未派隊　加、祇有秘魯一國老遠走來、歐洲方面如法蘭西荷閻·西班牙·捷克·比利士·南斯拉夫·諸國、也因假期中薪金的問題停止加入、减低了不少的興趣、起先希望有三十國加入的、到後來祗得十六單位、統共比賽了十五塲、便尋出錦標的得主了、</p>
<p>從上面的　表看起來、第二週的結果和比數、有幾處是實力懸殊的表微、但到了準决賽便不同了、最後的四塲比賽、差不多次都在那延長時閒裏頭解决高下、賽情的劇烈、和實力的接近、可推想得之了、關於各國的球藝、就中有雷同的陣法、也有岐異的戰略、有我們司空習見的措施、也有新吾人眼界的踢法、種種式式、確有研究和師法的　、像挪威國採用的「第三後術」陣法、“Third　back　game”是不但我們國內夢想不到、就是在東半球各處、也從未一見的、我願有空閒的時間和心情、把較僥興味的足球戰略、及各有的春秋、詳盡一點、另寫出來、讓關心球事的同胞們、共同推敲其中的妙與不妙、從道研究中、或可以提高我國足球現在的程度、（未完）</p>

<h3>外國人愛用國貨的一斑</h3>
<p>— 嚴懋德</p>
<p>提倡國貨，已經十多年了，可是得到效力還是微小得很，允以都市一般摩登的士女們，從頭至足，所需的東西，都醉心於外貨，以購用外貨為闊綽，成為外貨的好主顧，此無形的毒，誠如孫總理所謂的；「此用幾百萬兵來殺我們，還要厲害。」</p>
<p>吾人試觀各國的人民，其愛用國貨的心理，實使吾人慚愧萬分，醫如，日本人無論在國內國外，無不樂用國貨，雖微小的東西，如筷，線等，也莫不爭先購買本國貨，故民富而國强。</p>
<p>德國的父母們，時常敎誨着子弟，「用德意志的筆，德意志的墨水，德意志的紙，一絲一毫，勿取用於外貨，免我國（德國）的金錢，流溢國外，」特書於此，冀醉用外貨摩登士女們，也憬然的猛省了。</p>
<h3>國貨界的光榮　五洲建立十層新厦</h3>
<p>— 楊新生</p>
<p>最近，在上海市福州路河南路的轉角上，豎起了一座十層大厦，過路的人驟然看見這大厦，起先會當作道是一個大銀行—或者一個大洋行的華屋，仔細看看這大厦上的字跡，才知道這原來是五洲大藥房自建的十層新厦。</p>
<p>五洲大藥房，是我國新藥業的領袖，也是我國國貨界的急先鋒，它現在能够自已建起十層大厦，高屋連雲；道樣堂皇的景象，是我國國貨界的一種光榮，也是我國實業界進步的一種表現！</p>
<p>在過去，五洲大藥房及其所屬的工廠，創製各種家用良藥，衛生用品…增進人民康健，造福社會，這些工績是，很明顯的。尤其是對於工業上國防上的貢獻，如像已經成功的國產甘油，這更値得我們的欽佩。</p>
<p>至於該公司十層新厦的內部，業已佈置妥當，下面的兩層是營業部，上面的幾層是辦事室，各科名醫診所，和職員宿舍等。在三樓的中部，還建有該公司前總經理項松茂先生的紀念堂，由北平著名的工匠設計，莊嚴偉麗，用以紀念松茂先生的殉國死難。</p>
<p>就是今年的雙十節，該公司新厦就要舉行落成典禮和項氏紀念堂揭幕典禮，同時舉行創立三十週紀念，招待各界參觀，並日敦請實業部長吳鼎昌蒞臨訓詞。對於這一個偉大的事業的成就，屆時定有一番空前的熱烈的慶祝盛况呢！</p>

<h3>經濟力與活動力</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>王曉籟先生最近在市商會國貨展覽會說過：『國民服用舶來品，是毁絕國家的經濟力，是消滅民族的活動力。』換句話說：要增加國家的經濟力，擴大民族的活動力惟有提倡國貨，纔能達到這個目的。</p>
<p>我們試想想，中國五十年來和外國通商，年年入超數萬萬元，吸精吮髓，一年中白銀輸出者何可勝數，以致國力空虛民生桔槁國民之經濟力旣極薄弱，民族的活動力更形呆滯，、日積日累，燈盡油乾，造成此空前的國難，轉予謀我者以優厚之力量而授人以刃，等於自殺。中國對外貿易之失敗，與夫喜用洋貨的習慣，言之極堪痛心。吾人嘗謂中國人再不覺悟自拔，而壹惟洋貨之是尙，多者十年，少者五年，中國將至不堪收拾的地步。國力已虛，活動已北，此種國家與民族，若存若滅，不亡何待？</p>
<p>國人應明白現時代，為如何的時代？，磨刀霍霍，日在尋釁，日思所以滅亡我侮弄我。我苟不知不覺，而惟個人的身家性命是保，這是亡國民族的自待，而非所語於中國人的。我們認為國難嚴重到這般地步，非常時期，可說業已開始，我們做國民的以及工商業金融業各界，非從經濟力活動力兩方面切實準備不可。怎樣下手呢？</p>
<p>增進經濟力。應注意人力物力財力三種，人力可以訓練，可以學習，財力應充分準備貨幣，不使資金逃遁，國庫空虛，尤其應避免資金的外流。物力的準備，調節消費，减省消費，集中生產，改進生產，均屬目前應行注意之點。而要以提倡國貨服用國貨為核心。此為國民今日緊要關頭，千萬不可放鬆的。</p>
<p>增進活動力。活動力的擴張，卽在都市與農村的溝通。務使桔寂垂死的農村，變為活潑有生氣。虛僞繁榮之都市變為實力充物。此則有待於機製品與土產品之溝通，希望都市工廠之出品，在內地各有出路，農村生產之原料與土貨，可以源源外輸調劑盈虛，俾農村經濟得以靈活，而助長其購買的力量，民族的活動力，便由此養成。</p>
<p>這是非常時期我人應有的準備，也是國難嚴重中我人應有的工作。</p>

<p>九月十六日在滬病沒之國民政府委員徐固卿先生名紹楨，字固卿，廣東番禺縣孝廉，喜閱兵書，以候補道之資格，分發江南，頗為兩江總督端午橋所信任，創辦第九鎭新軍時，採用微兵制，一時文學庠序之士，投　從戒者甚夥，奏請先生為統制，（卽所用軍官，均陸軍學校出身，而富有民族思想老，如鎭江先烈趙聲黨國要人柏文蔚等，當時均隸渠部，所以傳播革命種子甚速，先生訓練士卒，以同甘苦」三字為原則，見軍官中有留學生而穿洋裝者，常詢其原料是何國貨，價格若干，雖不明言購用洋貨，利權外溢，但所部知其用意，以後卽不敢再用舶來品，潛移默化，相習成風，辛亥武昌起義，張勳鐵良向仇視新軍，唆使總督張人駿，對第九鎭取鹽視手叚，故舉動不便，反正時因無接濟而敗退丹陽，上挺蘇州相繼光復後，由陳英士程雪樓兩都督會商後，集江浙各省之軍隊為聯軍，而圍攻金陵，公推先生為總司令，京寗後，改充南京衛戌司令，厥後隨總理赴粵，迭任要職，廉潔自持，自任國民政府委員後，因年老多病，遷居上海，雖不良於行，但對於提倡國貨，依舊不懈，特製後面開門之汽車，及如小孩之雙輪推車各一輛，以便外出，蓬萊市塲內，時有渠之足跡，率領家人，選購國貨物品以供家用，滬上海次舉行國貨展覽會，渠必前往參觀，去歲大世界對面空地上，開國貨展覽會時，曾與會晤，暢談良久，渠謂提倡國貨，確係救國要圖，比任何工作更重要，蓋金錢如人身上之血，常此外流，安得不貧弱而夭亡，國貨廠商，對於製造方面，亦應硏究改良，然後能與外貨爭衡，蓋愛美人之天性，普通人民，不能僅以愛國二字强制其不買外貨，言時幷指示其所穿之衣，而謂本人已三十年不用舶來品矣，言猶在耳，豈料自此一別，卽成永訣哀哉。</p>

<h3>美棉現需堪稱活動</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、各月跌一二磅音、晨初因報告將次發表、市況呆滯、棉農套賣、多頭了結、週末天氣報告極佳、均為市價不振之因、其後同業買進、市勢趨堅、同業方面、深信新棉走動、將至極峯、現需活動、腳地堅昂、布市靜而挺秀、廠家已售至明年、胡頗有限價購買之意、收盤時因有補空、依然堅昂、計現貨漲三磅音、期貨漲三至五磅音、英棉現貨跌七點、期貨跌一點、印棉空戶拋賣、多頭了續、棉農布售　　　及平果爾、惟同業逢跌購進、計平果爾及　　　跌〇·七五羅比、白銀凈不動、　　錄左、（五日電）</p>

<h3>呢羢價昂花色又少</h3>
<p>昨日呢羢交易甚佳、標準行情高漲、新花色到貨毋多、故市上買賣之貨、均無特殊花樣、且沽價太高、致買方購辦均嫌價昂、而貨殘缺也、榮康元常平厚呢昨全市開出二十餘疋、價三元、天祥漢中王尺六絨開出五箱、價一元六角、寶克鞋毯呢售開十餘疋、價七元八角、達隆羊城牌嗶嘰售開十餘件、價二元七角半、元常黃華特呢開出十餘疋、價四元凈盤、</p>

<p>查一天市況極為飄忽、晨開為一一五四元八角、收盤為一一五六元九角、最高一一五七元四角、最低一一五四元三角、計三元一角上落、結果較前收回好三元八角、本月份條子仍剩四百九十條、共計多方七家、空方六家、十一月期籌碼總計八千六百三十一條、共計多頭三十八家、空頭三十家、成交總數前市四千零九十五條、後市一千八百五十五條、</p>
<h3>匯兌下降　本埠外匯英鬆美緊　中行拋售近期美匯</h3>
<p>匯市昨以匯兌下降、英鬆美緊、中行則塞美金、晨初以海外電告、倫敦大條近遠俱平、紐約銀市勿動、蒙得里遠期銀價亦然、倫敦純金升半便士、英對美縮一分八七五、美對英降一分二八一二五、英對法跌十九磅音、美對法縮一二五、匯市晨開近期賣價、英匯一先令二便士三四三七五及三七五對搭、美匯二十九元四三七五、較之前收、計英平而美緊零六二五、中央銀行掛牌揭曉英美俱平、關金勿動、人心平和、開後銀行拋出遠期而　平、匯豐銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、華商銀行趁勢供售、美金過程乃鬆、惟外商銀行趁鬆均扒、白銀平衡稅亦平、此後大勢盤旋、華商因謠傳關係、略有扒結、午刻漸又平定、後市銀行紛扒　美金而拋出遠期、中國行家力拋現美金、過程尚定、遠期仍難一致、華商有所扒結也、迨收盤近期賣價、英匯一先令二便士三七五、美匯二十九元四三七五、較前收、計英微鬆而美緊零六二五、華商約扒美金三十餘萬元、今將一天市況錄後、</p>

<h3>證券　時局變幻莫測　公債大漲小回頭　丙丁戊三種衝出六十元關　成交大旺達一千三百餘萬</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、市況起落靡定、兔起鶻落、初則謠言將發行流涌劵七萬萬、此說由某市場傳來、終以金融界證實根本無此說、市價隨人心之冷熱、起伏極鉅、因此其俾無稽之謠、亦隨之而起、市價上漲過份、跌落亦易、前途殊難樂觀、昨日開盤、人心極佳、以蔣院長回京、交涉事態、當可展開、三十五及四十五號等、尤以散戶為甚、買進極湧、不乏由空翻多、市價一致上漲一二角至三角半、次盤人心為之帶好、三十五號繼續買進不已、二十三號亦吸收不少、再漲一二角至四角、午後開盤、傳言發行流通劵、人心狂熱、市場買氣之濃厚、月餘來未有之好現象、且在多日上漲之後、丙丁戊一律衝出六十元大關、尤為難能可貴、竟再大漲三四角至九角半之多、收盤謠言突起、做戊種者尚在盲從、再好一角至四角半、拍丁種時、形勢驟轉、漸漸由疲轉跌、前之做多者、轉而出籠、甚至放空、市場流言、非但並無流通劵之說、且更有其他不利之謠傳、杯弓蛇影、復自相驚擾、忽然轉跌六七角、連最緊俏之甲種、亦復立腳不定、跌去半元、但市價結果、仍係一致上漲、惟其差額距離太遠、甲種祇好三角半、戊種竟好一元三角半、故今日市價變動、必尚有驚人之現象也、成交總數、共計一千三百十九萬五千元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>糧食　標粉空戶忍痛爭補　反跌為漲：遠月跳四五分</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份初呈跌風、至下午又復猛漲之勢、以洋麥報價、芝加哥加跌四角零、坎拿大跌二三角不等、故開價時、各月份市面、較之前日、雖跌二三分不等、賣買交易、均見暢旺、惟以後因大戶雖有出檔、而人心則仍良好、是以盤旋之中、回上一分外、迨至下午開盤、局面又復大變、因市場謠傳、幣制又將變更、謂流通劵即將公布、以便統制一國之經濟、是以投機幫羣起搶買、空方雙忍痛爭補、致市氣扶搖直上、較之前日收盤、遠期反騰漲三五分之巨、觀目下情形、半屬時局、半屬津銷之良好、故前途將無捉摸之方法、</p>
<h3>期麥跌後反漲　遠月竟漲八分之鉅</h3>
<p>昨日期麥上午開盤、各月份因洋麥報價、回跌二三四角不等、且以前日之漲度太速、又不免反動、是以各月份開價、即較前日跌三四分、以後因多頭回出、人心又見虛軟、續小一二分、迨至下午開盤、形勢遂見大變、初以上午粉市跌而反漲、繼因謠傳通貨即將實行、致一般着名之投機幫、從之暢吸、故開價即跳四五分、後以買戶俞盛、續漲五六分、較之前日收價、反漲四五分至八分不等、此種情形、迨完全受時局之影響也、現麥市面、又提五分至一角、因廠胃尚佳、客戶遂標準而扳售、開山東大李集麥五元四角、固鎮麥五元三角九分、浦鎮麥五元一角七分、黃橋麥五元二角半、江北麥五元二角、次一角、南京麥五元一角二分、次一角、大橋麥五元二角二分、淮安麥五元三角、次二角七分、蕪湖麥五元一角七八分、瑤　麥五元三角半、次三角、唯亭麥五元零七分、由福新去八千包、申大去三千包云、</p>
<h3>河下米市無一不昂</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各幫來源又見轉稀、共到二十號、貨共四千餘石、而本銷活潑、包胃又有大連青島烟台等幫辦窑種百哥一千一二百包、薄破二百餘包、市況頓復活躍、若窑種百哥行情升起三四角、厚新粳加三角、杜洋等各色新尖相隨跟上一二角不等、厚薄破因之亦回起二尺有奇、新陰元帶緊、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源三十餘號、市上各種去胃、因市內情勢頗緊、以致早市交活、午市略平、市價破粳加一二角、新粳續緊二三角、窑種乏市、薄稻加角外、羊尖高貨加三角、中次加二角、杜埠尖加二三角、變千元仍無上落、客尖帶緊角許、</p>
<h3>客秈到銷兩旺　市面仍在望上中</h3>
<p>客秈到頭前日有二萬多包、昨日續有萬許、但貨主以時局嚴重、多主擯持扳俏、市面愈形挺站、而粵幫連日吸收糙米甚力、適近日糙秈到存兩稀、昨市又漲角許、其他各機米亦稍形帶俏、去路除本街與粵幫外、汕頭幫與北洋去胃甚貪、昨日更有泉州暢辦、內地與寗波亦有點綴、故人心與市面仍在繼續望上中、全日開贛米七千一百四十五包、浙米一萬二千包、漢糙四千包、台早米六百包、</p>
<h3>天旱黃豆難望豐收　芝蔴銷細市軟</h3>
<p>黃豆市況雖云年境豐稔、但照產區實際報告、近因天時太旱、身份出品雖佳、然在收成上大受影響、故市場中來源祇早登場之九江豆、絡繹不絕、餘均寥寥無幾、所以前塗頗緊穩、銷場榨油廠辦胃續勁、南洋幫去路亦不弱、昨統市做開各路新豆六千餘包、行情見砌五六分、芝蔴洋莊不動、毛貨來源見湧、銷場有而不暢、市態疲軟、暫時不易發展、須看洋莊去路若何耳、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價漸見平定</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢轉定、公會劃盤二四粗砂白現貨二十一元八角、轉口貨六元四角、東白四號現貨廿一元六角半、比升五分、餘無更動、本廠綿白金心大華等一號均二十元半、二三四五號照退、號盤有潮幫開出黃崗青百餘包、十四元二角至一角、文綿赤一百數十包、大利莊十四元八角、義合莊十四元一角、和合莊十四元三角、</p>
<h3>南北貨　同行圓又跌一二元</h3>
<p>同安桂圓近日到貨漸稀、但查號方前後所到之額、為數尚多、昨聞已有千餘箱開出、比前又跌一二元、大式較呆、猶未開通云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　洋莊絲經銷路尚佳</h3>
<p>昨日不莊綠茶銷路、依然呆滯、摩洛哥對於各路綠茶、認價非常緊縮、俄美行家、亦多持觀望態度、市面仍在沉悶中、昨市僅由協和錦隆等行、買進珍眉針眉等綠茶、共計二百餘箱、價仍平疲、祁門紅茶、存底祗有數百箱、皖贛紅茶總運銷處、現正忙於交割事項、以便結束云、</p>
<p>又據茶業公會報告云、綠茶市被法郎貶價後、市面無形停頓、日昨仍無相當進展、惟經各洋行與外洋買方數次電報往還後、對市價磋商略有眉目、昨如寶隆協和等行對各茶均有談盤、而以寶隆對各路珍眉所議之價、較為接近、日內可望成交、市面或可冀其打僵局云、</p>
<h3>五金　東洋新鐵品紛紛到滬</h3>
<p>東洋新鐵品、（為八幡大阪中山等廠所出品）、如新洋元·三角鐵·新洋板·丁字鐵·鋼板·工字鐵·黑鐵皮·等、最近幾日如三菱·匯山·諸棧紛紛均有裝到、查其數遠二萬數千擔、惟最近出路有限、執貨者頗具恐慌狀態、因此開價不易樂觀</p>
<h3>鋅片定出四百桶</h3>
<p>鋅片最近定價、每噸十八鎊、由英商某某等洋行做出四百桶、查海外來價其後均要十八鎊四先令、所以申市奇挺、況市存單薄、故開價益堅、</p>
<h3>特載　答徐州楊萬盛糧棧問</h3>
<p>（一）八月分芝蔴出口數量，係經上海商品檢騐局所檢騐出口者而言。</p>
<p>（二）運往美國之芝蔴表刊五四·六八公擔，即五十四公擔六十八公斤，每公擔為一百公斤，本報數字表中所用之·點，表明以下之數字為小數。</p>
<p>（三）火車每車可裝若干公擔，因車輛容積大小不同，裝二十噸至四十噸不等，每噸合十公擔，可照此推算。</p>
<p>本刊迭蒙閱者見問，甚願作答，以副雅望。惟是本刊篇幅有限，不能早日登出，致勞佇盼，深為軟仄。仍亦多事涉瑣碎，有不便一一在本刊披露，浪費篇幅，並祈鑒諒。　編者</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （張凰）</p>
<p>摩登小姐介紹道：『這位是我的一九三六年式的朋友。』</p>
<p>最醜陋的人是難得有的，因為那是造物主的處女作。</p>
<p>清室遺　傳侗的別號「紅豆館主」，人家聽錯了要誤認為那紅布纏頭虬　滿嘴的「紅頭鬼子」，其意識之美惡相去不可以道里計！</p>
<p>暑天晚上走路人頭頂上的草帽，不知是做什麼用的？</p>
<p>何必敎孩子們讀害呢？社會上所相宜的，都不是</p>
<p>獨差暑天的柏油馬路不大相宜於皮膚，否則婦女們的踵趾畢呈的高跟鞋大可不穿！</p>
<p>一分錢買一尺衣料，大家歎為便宜之至，但是我們不曾瞧見那一店家登出廣吿，招攬人家拿多少東西去換他一分錢，可見錢幣終是最可貴！</p>
<h3>爭投一票</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>選舉，是世界文明各國最良的制度，我們中華自民國以來，亦曾經舉行過幾次選政但終不能出於純潔，像當北洋軍閥竊政的時候，把選舉事業，造成一大堆穢史，這是多麽的可恥啊！想到當時各地方所謂『走馬燈，』『播鋪蓋』『倒棺材，』『換死屍，』種種名目，直覺得又氣悶，又好笑，然而一到末了，爽爽快快，竟拿出金錢來操縱一切，就呌『賄選，』從此無論什麽完好的選舉手續，盡行掃地了。</p>
<p>現在是兩樣的，推選國民代表，是根據國民大會組織法第一條約規定，大會的使命，就是『制定憲法，』和『行政憲法，所賦予的職權，』那末。。國民代表的責任，是何等重大？然而推選權的行使，首先都擔荷在鄉鎭長的雙肩上；所以產生國民代表，這一回能吾合於各地區域內民衆的公意，就看鄉鎭長現在所推選的，是怎樣一種人物而定；雖則鄉鎮長推選以後，尙須待專員公著的圈定，公民的决定，要知道推選的抉擇，也眞不容易哩！因為競選的人，有的請『吃，』有的竟『拉，』有的出以『監視，』故鄉鎭長的到了這個當兒，唯有把良心上的主張拿出來應付，纔是對得起民衆。</p>
<p>我想起以前薩爾的一回事，這個地方，歸德歸法，要從公民投票來决定，在這時候，有一位僑居在上海的德國小姐，他聽得消息後，馬上乘坐飛機，趕回去爭投一票，你想：伊是一個女子，而且遠離祖國，不是近在眼前，為了不肯放棄選舉的天職，雖是區區一票，在數字上面，沒有多大的關係，哼！那裏可以隨便不顧呢？所以推選國民代表，須要認識在中華民國史上，是多麽重大的一頁，就是競選，如其不出於卑污的手腕，而出於光明正大公開的態度，自然令人看重，那一個敢來譏笑和唾駡呢</p>
<h3>亡八蛋考</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>詈人之語，除以種種穢褻不堪入耳之言，重辱對方的母妻姊妹外，「亡八蛋」恐怕也要算最重而最普遍的了。「亡八蛋」三字，照字面分折起來：禮義廉恥，謂之八德；亡八者，卽詈人亡掉八德中的恥」字，卽「無恥」之謂。曰「蛋者」，猶言不成東西也。故「亡八蛋」云者，卽勿要臉孔的東西之謂。這詮釋想大家都已耳熟能詳，不必再多辭費了，</p>
<p>不過以「亡八」訓「無恥，」固是可通；但這似乎經生說經，終覺未免有些穿鑿。為什麽呢？粗俗的詈人之語，大槪都起自村夫野子，試問村夫野子懂什麼八德不八德呢！近閱淸道光年間別署秋齋氏所著載陽堂意外緣小說第五回，有云：</p>
<p>「鄺史堂接到了允氏的書信，拆開一看，嚇了一跳，心中如有小鹿兒撞起來了，暗想道：「這件事總是施猾計的黃鴇蛋害我的。若沒有這拐騙的一節，我這買妾一事，也不會敗露。這回子要逼這黃鴇蛋寫靠身的筆據，倒也不難；就是這椿……」</p>
<p>又第六回，允氏向其夫鄺史堂索施猾計的靠身筆據，也有說」你且取出那黃鴇蛋的靠身筆據來。」據此，則「亡八蛋」亦可作「黃鴇蛋，」且似以後者為較通俗。</p>
<p>「鴇」者「老鴇：」這字甚為通俗：冠以「黃」者，因這係響姓，任便舉之。故「黃鴇」猶「王婆。」簡言之，「黃鴇蛋」卽」婊子養」之謂。又，接駡人「黃鴇蛋，」其前有冠以「混帳」二字者。「帳，乃牀「帳」：「混帳，」猶帷薄不修之意，與「黃鴇蛋」合，通俗無分高下。故「亡八蛋」當係後出之語，因為之考。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳯</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第七回　手足情高匿函憐弱妹　詩書氣重窺影笑寒儒</p>
<p>所以江章兩人，通信到了兩三月，見面不下百十次，依然是一個不敢先開口說話。好在這秘密還沒有第三個人知道，兩人也就不妨慢慢的進行。然而道秘密，能够永遠的保持着嗎？天下可沒有道事。在通信後第四個月的時候，就出了事故了。國器給夢蘭的信，向來是寄到學堂裏的。但是到了六月尾上，已是放暑假了。信寄到學堂裏去，不知道要多少天，才能到夢蘭的手上。他在夢蘭的回信上，也揣想出來了，他是有很多女同學書信來往的。因此把信封上的字跡，也寫得更秀麗些，當了女子的信，向江家寄了去。其初有兩封信，也照樣的投到夢蘭的手上。一天，夢蘭隨着母親嫂嫂到親戚家裏去了。男子們却反是全在家裏。就在這個時候，國器有一封信投到江家來。接這封信的人，是一個不識字的女僕。他毫不猶豫的，就向老爺屋子裏送去。浩然帶上了眼睛，兩手正捧了一本書就了窗子邊的陽光坐着看。女僕說了一聲信，便直向浩然面前送去。浩然的大兒子梧軒，正站在他身邊，有話要說。一眼看到信封上的字，是妹妹的名字，而下欵又著了章寄兩宇，心裏忽然一動。記得前四五日，妹妹在堂屋裏坐，老媽子在外面拿了一封信來，他曾迎到天井裏去接着。那形狀似乎有點異乎尋常。再看這封信上，寫的是章寄。他的女同學裏面，似乎還沒有這樣一位姓章的小姐。在梧軒如此轉念頭的時候，他已經是很快的，把那信由女僕手上取了過去。浩然放下書來，問道：誰寄來的信。格軒答道：是我的同事一封信，託我轉交的。浩然正在看書很有趣的時候，就沒有再問，依然捧了書看。梧軒在父親面前站了一站，然後退了出去。到了自己屋子裏，把那封信取到手上，仔細端詳了一下，那筆跡雖然秀麗，但决不是小姐寫的字。而且這筆跡彷彿在什麽地方也看過的。雖然拆看他人的信件，是道德所不許的，然而這件事頗緊要。這封信若是有什麼秘密的話，今天落在父親手上，這問題就大了。於是掩上房門，拆開信封，慢慢的讀過。讀過之後，他靜靜的沉思了一番，自把道封信揣在身上，當天夢蘭回家，已是晚上二更天了，梧軒，雖然，是和他見著了一面，却是一個字也不提。（八二）</p>
<h3>青陽月</h3>
<p>— 紫微</p>
<p>趁中秋日的冠生團專軍，到青陽港去賞月，這回已是第三遭了。</p>
<p>延着港畔鐵橋架樮上懸掛的許多燈盞，依然放着綵色的光芒，俯視碧沉沉的港水，經不起東南風的吹動，皺起了魚鱗紋似的圖案，幾只潔白小艇，載得雋侶在淸流中蕩漾，悠閒，愉快，遠遠還有輕揚的歌聲從水面上度來，陶醉了，陶醉了幾許輕在。</p>
<p>仰首碧穹，皓月一輪，明鏡般的高懸着，周布的華蓋，好像霧穀輕精般的籠罩。浮雲朵朶，在碧海中聖凈而明薄，有時給祥和的月光照射，還襯出了層疊的峰嵐，這時候，遠樹成了墨朶，空氣裏帶來了微微桂香，這靜穆的秋月，凉爽的秋夜，叙許多勝流於一方，這是怎樣的愉快，歡樂，偶憶李重光—故國不堪回首月明中—句，不覺廢然興嘆。</p>
<p>這夜，我因為還有一些私務，所以乘月偕內人就在靑陽港換趁夜車到了故鄉—蘇州—，也應一應團聚的景兒哪，幾個月沒有回家，不覺嗣母又蒼瘦了許多，而姪輩已能牙牙學語，摸壁而走了，一覩先母遺影，又欲漣漣雪涕，這一晚憂喜交集，思之就不易入睡。</p>
<p>明天，訪紫蘭主人談談，又晤范雲書兄，承招至吳苑對門的一家菜館午飯，入晚便趁車返滬。</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<h3>黃海一瞥</h3>
<p>— 馮庫尼</p>
<p>晴朗的天，凉爽的風，在荒漠似的原野裏，提着輕鬆的步子，在軟絨似的沙土上走着，沿着沙土暴　着鐵軌似的牛車痕過去，便望見漫無邊際的黃海。</p>
<p>猛烈的風，天空裏的雲一朶朶的很快的向那邊兒飛過去。太陽放著金色的光。那許多漁民臉上掛著笑，又在疊着魚網裝上車去；剛才疲倦了的躺着憇息的兩條牛，又牽了過來和車繁在一起，牛背上鞭了幾下，它吼了一聲，疲乏似的背着笨重的率前去。</p>
<p>風在了一點，站在海邊上有些立脚不住，心裏感覺着異樣的恐慌，簡直害怕起來。那潮烏却悠間地唱着歌在海面上嬉戲。那老鷹也在海面旋轉我它的食料。</p>
<p>洶湧澎湃的海潮，老遠就望見一層層的水浪，隨着風飛快的向這邊衝過來，頓時海面上起了騷動，全是波浪在推動，匍匐的衡破了穆靜的天空。那邊海堤上猛的被水浪衡　了一下，水花惱怒似的飛起了幾丈高，海水衡毀了海堤的泥土。陽光映射在海際，好像有許多金蛇在水面上飛舞。</p>
<p>龐大的漁船，在黃海裏，便覺得渺乎其小，隨着起伏不定的海潮在飄盪，桅桿上張着篷，很雄壯的裝滿了鮮貨回來。海灘上的牛車，都往海中走去，漸漸地浸沒了牛的腿，漸漸地浸沒了牛的身體，只看見牛鼻子在水面上呼吸空氣。</p>
<p>突然的水浪，平靜下來，波浪漸漸地向前面推過去，沙灘上的水也在徐徐的退去。</p>
<p>當在退潮的時候，海邊上擠滿了人，背着麓子，手裏揑着鐵勾，海潮退了之後；海灘上浮着許多許多的蟹，蟬蛾，蚶子，他們很愉快的蹲着身子捕捉，他們全是依賴這許多水產生活的。</p>
<p>海濱的風有些凉，兩條腿站得有些酸，於是背着太陽，踏著海水浸過了的沙土回去。</p>

<h3>上海的小型迷樓</h3>
<p>— 薑公</p>
<p>上海人的生活，新奇神秘，帶着些滑稽意味，一點兒不落平凡，單是關於「住」的種種情形，巳經怪怪奇奇，窮形盡相，為異鄉人士所萬萬意想不到，尤其是房屋內部的搆造，花樣翻新，匠心獨運，眞可以打破古今中外的一切紀錄，便是新從外國留學回來的建築師也不能不瞠目駭汗，歛手推服！</p>
<p>從前科舉時代，八股文章的最下乘，有一種喚做「墨派」也者，以堆砌冗沓見長專門用「關門閉戶掩柴扉」，「夫天地者，宇宙之乾坤」，之類的濫調兒，所謂「屋上架屋，床上疊床」，世人莫不傳為笑談。在上海，走到許多人家裏，便時常可以看見這種「墨卷」式的重樓複閣，密似證房，小於鴿籠，疊床架屋，是絲亳不足為奇的。</p>
<p>就因為上海的房租太貴，更有一般人，如三房東三房東之類，要從中取利，自然不能不在這小小的房子裏面想主意，出花樣，以達到他們養家活口，一勞永逸的目的，有些聰明的二房東，心思玲瓏，手段高妙，能想入非非，將一幢尋常一上一下的房屋，改造做五層樓的大厦，添設臥室十幾間之多，—偌大的地方，竞可以容納住戶至一二十家以上，這種精密的設計，超人的技巧，眞可以被稱頌為經濟博士工程專家而無愧！</p>
<p>上海舊式的一上一下的住宅，普通都是：石庫門內，一個小小長方形的天井，前面一間客堂，後面一間廚房，可以正式當做臥室的，祇有樓上的客堂樓和亭子間兩個房間而已。在上海，老實人是沒有飯吃的！假使老老實實就道樣分租出去，二房東不都要喝西北風嗎？要想白住房子之外再解决衣食婚喪等之重大問題，除非是做夢！然而不必我等費心，他們自有妙法！</p>
<p>他們第一步，先在天井上面蓋一層白鐵棚，將客堂一直擴充到大門口，屛鬥冉向後移動，當中用板壁隔做兩間，旁邊略抽出一條窄窄的甬道，最後，樓梯下面，也可以隔成一間，於是，最少也有三個房間了。廚房，不消說，當然也在改造之列，樓上的客堂樓，也可以仿下面容堂的辦法，分做兩間或三間。樓梯當中，照例搭一間夾板式的擱樓，精明的　房東，還有在客堂樓之下和客堂之上，當中橫添一座擱樓的。樓上，更義不容辭，在後樓上搭一間較大的。屋頂上，曬臺上，愈加是天經地義，可以高高的添闢出　層來，這大約可喚做崇樓傑閣，不在擱樓之內了。似道般，最低限度，可以在原有的兩層之外，添出三層以上的樓房！至於，亭子間裏面堆放物件的小型擱樓，還不必細算在內。經過這番大興土木以後，儼如隋煬帝的迷樓，麻雀雖小，倒也五臟俱全，大房東跑來，簡直會不認得這是他的房子了。二房東每月付給大房東的租金，不過二十餘元，而收入却至少有七八十元左右，這種生利的方法，倒比自置房產來得美妙，（不過那筆建築費，也要花到千元上下，他們總算也是將本求利啊！）祗是那些做三房客的，鼻子眼睛擠在一處，人聲嘈雜，空氣惡濁，屋子裏面污穢不堪，未免太苦了！</p>
<p>最苦的，要算那些住在擱樓裏面的，終歲不見天日，白書也須點着電燈，而且，祇好橫著身體睡，而絕對不能直著腰幹立，可憐他們彎腰低頭，只能做一世的矮子！一到夏天，文風不透，臭氣撲鼻，更往往要悶出痧來，眞是花錢受罪，這種生活，恐怕比坐在死囚牢裏不差什麼吧！</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>論英雄與成敗</h3>
<p>— 方克文</p>
<p>吾國出席第十一屆世界運動會代表團回來了，以『不以成敗論英雄』的古話來說，我們實在不應該對鴨蛋而回的選手們加以訕笑嘲罵，何況『此次吾國遣派選手，參加世運會，成績如何，在未出國之前，早已預知，惟所以參加之原因，實為求取經騐，並以前次洛杉磯世運會，吾國僅有一人參加，此次實為第一次之正式加入，深冀因參加而引起全體國人之注意，……此次參加世運後，因相較之下，强弱懸殊，尚可使國人從而知所奮勉，有所努力』：因之，我們對這些『失敗』而回的『英雄』，似乎更不應加以訕笑和嘲罵。</p>
<p>但是『不以成敗論英雄』之說雖可為失敗的英雄們聊以解嘲，却不能替失敗的英雄們作護符，我們還得看看這位英雄是如何敗法，和說這句話的是誰。</p>
<p>我們的英雄是如何敗法的呢？『此次吾國遣派選手，參加世運會，成績如何？在未出國之前』，原是『早已預知』的，這不能怪『英雄』們，然而世運消息傳來，却有超出我們『預知』之外的，例如在徑賽中，我們的選手在預賽中以便以末名落選，在田賽中，連『資格』都夠不上，而于球類中，友誼賽能勝人家的，於正式比賽中却敗給人家，以這樣悽慘的結局，難道是我們，早已預知的嗎？</p>
<p>英雄們的敗是不足為恥的，然而敗也應該有可以原諒的理由，平時有『資格』可以和人家一決雌雄，力竭而敗，那也許可以說是雖敗猶榮。然而我們的英雄却是平時雖勉强移得上『資格』，臨時却連『資格』都夠不上了，這樣的敗，難道也能以『不以成敗論英雄』來『論』嗎？</p>
<p>在花的小說裏，我們時常看到失敗的英雄向得勝的英雄說：『三年之後，當再來領教』之類的話。說這樣的話的英雄，或者是真的去從頭實行他的『君子報仇三年』計劃，或者，則是借此酬以解嘲，作為收篷的口頭禪的。我們這次失敗了，『四年報仇論』也就唱得很響，可是這是前者還是後者呢？我不敢往壞處去着想，也不願往壞處去着想，且待四年之後再來見分曉吧！</p>
<p>而于這四年報仇論高唱入雲聲中，却也有人說，『此番之失敗，亦可謂為造成此後勝利之主因，……蓋與其小勝而驕，不若大敗後之得以自警，亦不致蹈夜郞自大之惡習』云云，對失敗的英雄不應加以嘲笑而加以勉勵，原不能算錯，但如果加以種種寬恕，甚之謂小勝不若大敗，好像『大敗』比『小勝』來得好，這我却不能表示同意。固然，說這話的原意並不如此，或許還正在此相反，然而如果小勝了固驕，而大敗了又並不自警，這又如何呢？——我們是該有清算自己的錯誤的勇氣的。</p>
<p>說大敗了並不自警，這或許有些武斷，並且是近乎侮蔑，但這筆帳我以為最好是四年以後再來算：就退一步來說，算是四年之後『小勝』而回了吧如果一般國民的體力依舊如此，祇靠幾個什麼『王』什麼『魚』來撐撐場面，不再吃鴨蛋了，那還是失敗，因為體育之道，是並不存在乎造成幾個『體育明星』，而體育界中的『明星制度』如果依舊存在下去，則即使再吃鴨蛋而回，在國內，這些鴨蛋選手還是免不了要『夜郞自大』的。</p>
<p>因為在國內，他們還是『蜀中無大將』中的『大將』。</p>

<h3>老拉克與蕊莎（續）</h3>
<p>— 林娜</p>
<p>『蕊莎你不能這樣下去，你要想一想自己底年紀……』老拉克現着憂慮的神色。</p>
<p>『他們……都那麼野蠻……爸……我怕！』女兒面紅紅的，嚅囁着，低住頭。</p>
<p>『這是沒辦法的啊！你想一想我今年五十二了，還有幾個五十二趕馬車？』</p>
<p>女兒把頭低的更低了，現着沉思，一句話也不說，嘴唇蒼白而且發抖的。</p>
<p>有一天，老拉克提前趕回家，坐在凳子上抽烟斗，女兒也剛從椰林里回來，她手中抱了一大包烤麺包，面上現着昑喜的神氣，嘴角浮着笑，在他面前顫顫地站立着。老拉克向她漠然地看着，便用詫異的口吻問道：『蕊莎這是怎麼回事？』</p>
<p>『你猜一猜看，爸爸……』女兒微笑着說，現出了自得的樣子。</p>
<p>老拉克猜不出，便搖着頭；於是她就接着說道：『街上那個烤麺包的送給我們的，他說：蕊莎你老子還沒回來嗎？他沒有留給你買麺包的錢嗎？這都不打緊，這是我送給你的。』</p>
<p>『這話是什麼時候說的？』老拉克不快地皺着眉。</p>
<p>『他當我從他們那邊過時，常常把我拉進店去這樣說！我沒有收他，這回才收他。……』</p>
<p>『他對你有過什麼表示沒有？』</p>
<p>女兒面漲得紅紅的，便低低的嚅囁着：『他，他愛了我……』她相信老頭子要因此而面泛出喜色的。然而，他沒有，他現得很悽然，嘴角抖動着，用絕望的聲調悄悄喃道：</p>
<p>『這是不可能的，蕊莎。……』</p>
<p>麺包師他認識的，是一個肥胖的，</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>三十左右歲的美國人。老人為着自己兒子底不幸，對於作為統治者的白種人，總有一種仇恨。他常常憤然的說：「他們已吸乾了菲律濱人底血汁了，現在更把老白姓當囚犯關起來，為的只是能在牢房工廠哩多一些替他們做義務苦工的人！」</p>
<p>想着，他底心給深深的仇恨苦痛着了。</p>
<p>粗重的馬車拖過了蛋石子小街，不久便在一個竹籬笆外停下·房子里有燈光，也有歡笑聲老頭子皺着眉，他悄悄的在車臺上傾聽着，有一種尖長的男音把他吸住了，他疑惑着它是從那肥胖的　包　。里　　的·於　　　便　　　，跨過籬笆門，很響的踢著通到小屋里去的矮板梯。不一會在那矮屋子里，就出現着那個麵包師，女兒斂着笑面跟在他背後。他惶惑而不安的向老頭子道着歉，便大踏步的走了。</p>
<p>老人用憤怒的眼睛送走了他，便在女兒底而前站着，默默的問道：</p>
<p>「蕊莎，這是怎麼回事？……」</p>
<p>「他來向我求婚，爸爸，……他怪可憐的跪在我面前，眼里流着淚，：說，蕊莎嫁給我吧，我底心……」老人不耐煩地忙用手截住她：</p>
<p>「你怎樣……？」</p>
<p>「我也哭着，我答應了……他是好　　我也　　　爸爸　讓　們結婚吧·」</p>
<p>老人絕望地低若頭，他想起了在牢房里的兒子，全身就變起燃燒樣的難堪起來。終於他下了什麽大决心似的抖抖說道：「你要嫁給他，好，馬上跟我走吧！」</p>
<p>女兒跟他爬上了馬車，馬上便望海灘出發了。晚上，老人單獨趕着車回來，很舒適的睡着，從第二天起，誰再也看不見蕊莎了。</p>
<h3>朱紫霞趕船之戲裝</h3>
<h3>竹園的故事</h3>
<p>— 沈家千</p>
<p>早上下過一陣雨，午後已放晴了，新秋的天空彷彿一個光潔的皮球，淡黃的太陽光又從雲層裏探出頭來照著這寂寞的院子，茂生吃中飯時候多喝了一點酒，抽了一把稻草在牆角落裏打草鞋。那是茂生的特殊技能，他脚上穿的草鞋都是自己打的，可是自己打的草鞋沒有買的耐穿，就常常看見他在牆角落裏結稻草了。</p>
<p>茂生是我家的老僕人，還是從祖父手裏到我家來的，現在總在六十開外了吧。但是人家問他年齡的時侯，他祗是拉開了嘴巴說：「你猜罷」。問的人猜他多大年紀，他就點點頭：「猜得準！猜得準！」從來沒有規規矩矩吿訴人家的。祖母聽見了就罵他：「年紀活在狗身上，還像孩子一樣沒頭腦！」他也是笑笑走開了。</p>
<p>茂生喜歡講故事，就和我們孩子特別要好起來。他打草鞋的時候，孩子們總圍著他。</p>
<p>「茂生，講一個呆女婿。」</p>
<p>「不，茂生，講包公出世，後來那個狐狸精怎樣報恩？」</p>
<p>「是的，你不是說今天講下去嗎？」</p>
<p>「不要吵！不要吵！」他攤開手，要我們坐了，然後抬起眼睛望着天雲，「二個都講。先講呆女婿，再講狐狸精報恩。」</p>
<p>於是他從前有一個呆女婿　　」開始講故事了，一個接著一個，到燒晚飯手裏的草鞋沒有打上半隻。</p>
<p>今天孩子們跑到誰家來玩要了，茂生彷彿微也微戚到有點寂寞，他有一手沒一手地打著草鞋，眼睛不時抬在天空裏，像馬上「從前有個呆女婿……」要從他嘴裏落下來似的。</p>
<p>我偸偸地走到他背後，用手掌蒙了他眼睛問他是誰。</p>
<p>「是大官，我不看就知道的。怎不到外面去玩？」</p>
<p>「他們都跑了，那裏去玩呢？」我坐到他的身邊。</p>
<p>「好！」他把稻草一掃，好像他本來沒有意思要打草鞋，「我帶你去玩，到竹園裏掘筍去。」</p>
<p>「瞎說，現在那裏有筍？」我不相信。　　　不　　跟我掘去；　　　手拉工　，在牆角落裏帶了兩柄　　，　　給我　　　　　裏（未完）</p>

<h3>黎明暉與「清明時節」</h3>
<p>黎明暉，這位久了闊了的藝人，這次加入明星公司第一部戲是主演了歐陽予倩導演的「清明時節」。這是一部以暴露遺產毒令時以封建家庭中的婦女糾葛為中心題材的作品，黎明暉在這裏是扮演一個被壓迫在一般舊家庭裏的婢女；她最初是為這個家庭的主人的誘惑而失去她清白的貞操，繼而又遭受了主婦的毒打和主人的遺棄。這時她已有着一個孩子，這個苦命的孩子，一生出世，就遇見兇惡的殘酷的面目，和奸人們對他的毒辣的手段。從這兒，發展出了一個可歌可泣故事。</p>
<p>自演「女人」後，已久寂影壇的黎明暉，這裏是演着一個被壓迫的女性；變過去之作風，在大導演歐陽予倩之合作下，她是　着非常的成就。</p>
<h3>大光明映「歌壇登龍術」</h3>
<p>是一部偉大富麗的歌舞片</p>
<p>大光明大戲院，初定今日（星期三）起開映「跑馬廳血案」，今以特殊原因，臨時改映二十世紀福斯公司出品，滑稽歌舞　片「歌壇登龍術」Sirg　Baby　Sing。該片的故事，係影射電影明星約翰巴里穆亞追求一位少女的趣史。主角除愛麗絲費及亞道夫孟郁外，尚有大批滑稽歌星影星加入新穎奇特，亦多屬銀幕上所罕見者。本片無異是明星的大集會，歌舞的大本營，笑料的總動員，在歌舞片中，堪稱首屈一指云。</p>

<h3>North China Economic Development: Japanese Side Says Principles Have Been Decided. Priority to Completing the Transportation Network Plan. --Remarks by the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin--</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, Horiuchi, stated that the principles of North China's economic development have been determined, and the military and the Consulate-General are in agreement. They often exchange views with each other to promote convenience. This matter is being carried out separately by officials and civilians, without being restricted by the two foreign agencies of the Army and the Ministry. I cannot disclose the content of the recent talks between Tashiro and Song in Tianjin. However, what can be announced is that the Japanese side believes that economic cooperation should first focus on the completion of the transportation network, such as railways and highways, which must be built and repaired in advance to facilitate the export of North China's products. Secondly, the improvement of cotton is also an essential matter. Japan needs 8 million yuan of Indian and American cotton every year. North China is the most abundant in cotton production and is very suitable for stable planting. If it is improved with technical assistance from the Japanese side, production will be more abundant and refined. If China can sell a large amount of cotton to Japan, the Japanese side will abandon long-distance procurement and purchase nearby as much as possible for the convenience of raw material acquisition. As North China's rural areas sell more cotton, their economies become more prosperous, their ability to purchase Japanese goods naturally increases, and Sino-Japanese economies naturally reach a degree of cooperation. Horiuchi continued that both Chinese and Japanese people need to organize this matter. This is just one example. There are many others included in economic cooperation. The Tianjin Consulate-General is busy with its duties to handle this matter and has designated Consul An and Vice-Consul Nagai to be responsible. Soon, Secretary Ogiwara will also be sent from the Shanghai Embassy to serve as consul at this consulate to assist in this type of work. Many merchants in our country have come to North China to investigate recently. If there are any unclear points, the consulate will provide guidance and explanation, or introduce them to experts for consultation. Even if a Chinese person wants to jointly invest in a business with a Japanese person, the consulate can also introduce them to cooperate with Japanese merchants. Sino-Japanese negotiations are starting in Nanjing. Economic cooperation must be discussed, but no matter the outcome, it will not affect the progress of this matter, because the development of North China's economy is based on a need that has been decided and must be promoted according to plan. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Iida, a senior staff officer of the Japanese military in Tianjin, went to Jinan on the morning of the 6th. Under orders from Tashiro, he contacted Han Fuju. Colonel Imai of the Beiping Military Office came to Tianjin early on the 6th to visit Hashimoto to discuss important matters.

The Kwantung Army has been actively sending personnel to cooperate with Manchu technicians in surveying. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Horiuchi said that due to the large amount of work and the increase in the number of expatriates, the Tianjin Consulate-General has now established a consular branch in Cangzhou Qikou. It depends on whether expatriates already live there. A consular branch will be established in Taiyuan, which will be managed by the Beiping Consulate. The powers of the Tianjin Consulate-General are organized in accordance with the law, and its powers have not been expanded in any way. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Garrison Encloses Salt Flats in Tanggu and Lutai. Japanese Claim They Will Offer to Purchase Them. Competent Authorities Are Discussing How to Respond.</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) According to news from Tanggu, the Japanese garrison has recently placed wooden stakes around the four salt flats of Nandatan, Beidatan, Li Haiwaihai, etc. in southern Tanggu, inscribed with the slogan "Land for Use by the Great Japanese Army". If any buildings are constructed here, the Tonghai salt ditches will inevitably be cut off, and the entire beach production of Tanggu will inevitably be destroyed. According to the Japanese, they will offer to purchase the land and will need to expand outward. The beach owners are extremely alarmed. According to news from Lutai, five people from the Xingzhong Wu Company, including Tei Hideo and Hiroshi Ishizaki, went to the Lutai beach on the afternoon of the 1st, met with the beach manager Liu Yuchun, and claimed that they would open a canal and build a bridge at the Hanbian salt pier on the 3rd, leading to the center of the river. The company has not been authorized by our side, but it intends to build a bridge outside the beach, which will inevitably hinder our shipping of salt and all management rights in the future. It is reported that the competent authorities are currently discussing how to respond. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese ship Fuku Maru, which exports Lutai salt, broke down in the middle of the voyage and returned to Moji.

The second transport ship, Matsuura Maru, will also be delayed for several days. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>French Franc Devaluation Stabilizes Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The French government's abandonment of the gold standard and implementation of the devaluation of the French franc, joining forces with Britain and the United States, has been discussed by scholars in our country. It has little impact on trade between us and foreign countries. Our financial authorities have received a detailed report from Guo Taiqi, the representative of the League of Nations. Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi will formally issue a statement expressing his approval. According to financiers, this move by the French government marks the end of the past currency war of the three major groups and is indeed a good phenomenon internationally. Our country's foreign exchange can also be stabilized, which is closely related to foreign trade. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The leaders of the three major monetary groups of Britain, the United States, and France have ended their currency war and closely joined hands to conclude a monetary agreement. Our financial authorities have expressed their deep approval. They have now telegraphed Ambassador Guo Taiqi in the United Kingdom to inform the financial authorities of the three countries for their information. It is heard that our financial authorities believe that this move by the three countries is not only a precursor to the restoration of the world economy to normalcy, but will also have a natural effect of international political appeasement and consolidate world peace. In the future, international exchange rates will become stable as a result, which will benefit our country's currency system. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Fiscal Year Reform Plan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The start date of the fiscal year in various countries is mostly determined by the convenience of deliberation by their legislative bodies and the needs of their special financial circumstances. Our country initially adopted the American July system in the early years of the Republic, which is not in line with the current domestic situation. It seems that the January system should be adopted instead. This plan to reform the fiscal year has been submitted by experts to government agencies and business circles for their opinions, and they have all agreed.

<h3>Judicial Yuan Orders Cautious Use of the Principle of Free Conviction</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Judicial Yuan believes that the principle of free conviction in criminal procedure law and the principle of true discovery go hand in hand. What is permitted for free judgment is only the probative force of the evidence. As for the determination of criminal facts, it should be based on the evidence rules stipulated in the law, which are very clear. In recent years, there have been many judges who understand this, but there have also been instances where they misunderstand the principle of free conviction, relying only on speculation and arbitrary decisions. It must be known that imprisonment and judgment are of utmost importance and should not be taken lightly. Otherwise, it may lead to wrongful convictions and leniency, using the name of free conviction to cover up their negligence and carelessness. The consequences would be unimaginable. Therefore, the Ministry of Justice is ordered to notify and warn them to exercise strict supervision. If such circumstances are found, they should be strictly punished in accordance with Articles 88 and 89 of the Court Organization Law in order to serve as a warning.

<p>Letter Received:</p>
<p>Having read in your esteemed newspaper on October 4th the special Tianjin dispatch on the 3rd which said, "The Tianjin-Pukou Railway dispatching telephone line between Tianjin and Yangliuqing was cut off for six kilometers for unknown reasons," the facts are considerably inconsistent. It has been discovered the affairs telephone between Liangwangzhuang to Yangliuqing line did indeed on the evening of September 27th at 8 o'clock some, be found broken at Shuangzhan six sections, for approximately three hundred meters. This was immediately addressed by dispatching workers to rush to repair it, and by 12:10AM that night, communications were restored. Vehicle transit was not impacted. Thus, on October 3rd, there was no case of telephone wire being cut off. Fearing that rumours would cause miscommunication, we specially send this letter, please investigate and correct it. Respectfully, Tianjin-Pukou Railway Vehicle Affairs Office. October 5th.</p>
<h3>Review of Trade Surplus, Trade Deficit, and Our Country's Trade Surplus and Deficit (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Luo Dunwei</p>
<p>——Speech on the Central Broadcasting Station——</p>
<p>First, let's examine the main countries involved in our country's trade: Although Portugal and Spain were the earliest in modern international trade with our country, Britain was the first to formally establish agencies to protect trade. In 1684, Britain obtained permission from the Qing court to establish a trading post in Guangzhou, officially opening trade. After the Opium War, the Treaty of Nanjing was signed, obtaining the cession of Hong Kong and the convenience of five trading ports. British trade with our country flourished even more. Later, with the establishment of various unequal treaties for Tianjin, Yantai, Burma, and Tibet, Britain's commercial power could be said to have dominated East Asia. After the Sino-Japanese War, Japan gained independence for Korea (it was independent at that time), and acquired Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, leading to a rapid increase in trade with our country. Later, after the Russo-Japanese War and the annexation of Korea, Japan could compete with Britain. During the European War, taking advantage of the fact that various countries had no energy to attend to East Asia, Japan dominated for a time, taking first place in trade with China. After the end of the European War, the United States, due to the war, transformed from a debtor nation to a creditor nation. The so-called "permanent prosperity" in the economic sphere reached everywhere in the world, and it also seized the first place in trade with our country. Japan had to retreat to second place. (See attached table)</p>
<p>Second, let's now discuss import and export commodities: Our country's important import commodities were originally mainly opium, woollen cloth, and hardware. Later, the import of British cotton fabrics increased. In 1870, the import of cotton goods accounted for one percent of our total imports. Until before the European War, cotton goods were always the most imported item by Britain into our country. As a result, the basic work of "female weaving" in our country's agriculture was defeated, naturally posing a major threat to the countryside. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, international imperialism has been able to infiltrate our economy in every way, so the imported goods have become particularly complex, with almost everything available. In recent years, even coffins for the dead have been imported. The foreign-style steel coffins that you have seen in funeral homes are made of imported materials. What is particularly noteworthy is the increased import of food and the decrease in the export of agricultural products in recent years. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the total value of imported rice and wheat was close to 200 million yuan. The amount of food imported annually is still very large now. Needless to say, the import of cotton is also very large. It ranked first in the 21st year of the Republic of China, reaching 180,782,997 yuan. Thus, "male farming," a basic condition in our country's economy, has also been threatened. Exports are even more dangerous. Our country's exports have always been dominated by silk and tea; soybeans also accounted for a considerable amount. Initially, silk and tea accounted for 80% of the total value of exports. Later, due to competition from Japanese and French silk and tea, it fell to 50% in 1898, and has become even worse in recent years. Soybeans have accounted for a large proportion of export commodities in recent years, sometimes ranking first. The situation completely changed after the "September 18th" Incident; in the 22nd year, it turned into a trade deficit. Recently, due to the increase in tung oil exports, the situation is a little better, but as of now, there has been no major turnaround in the export of silk and tea. Moreover, recently, I studied the import of luxury goods and found that the annual import of items such as tobacco and alcohol is very large. The average is always around 40 million yuan per year, with tobacco imports being the largest. It accounted for more than 19 million yuan in the 22nd year and more than 14 million yuan in the 23rd year. These statements all show the severity of our country's economic ailments, so everyone should pay special attention.</p>
<p>Third, let's analyze the methods to offset our country's trade deficit: Our country's trade deficit is very large: even in the last five years alone, it has exceeded 3.1 billion yuan of silver. Can it offset this five-year trade deficit? However, in fact, since the establishment of the Republic of China, silver imports have always been greater than exports, which is a trade deficit. In the last five years, the 21st and 22nd years of the Republic of China were still trade deficits; the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th years were trade surpluses. However, the amount is still limited. Even adding the smuggling of silver, it is not very large. In any case, it is far from the aforementioned 3.1 billion yuan. Therefore, according to general research, the methods to offset our country's trade deficit are roughly as follows: Cultural expenses of foreigners in China; Expenses of foreigners traveling to China; Expenses of foreign troops stationed in China; Foreign investment in China; Remittances from overseas Chinese. Among the five offsetting methods above, the first, second, and third are very small. Moreover, the third is greatly detrimental to our country. The fourth, the way foreign capital has been used in the past is incorrect and has only helped to fuel imperialist aggression. The only legitimate and beneficial offsetting method for our country is the fifth, remittances from overseas Chinese. It is true that remittances from overseas Chinese are a major offsetting method in our country's international balance, which is known to everyone. However, there is no consistent estimate of the exact amount. Dr. Morse estimated it at 110 million yuan in 1903. Remer, based on his own investigation, estimated an average of about 300 million yuan per year in 1928, 1929, and 1930. In the past five years, the Bank of China has estimated overseas Chinese remittances; the lowest is 200 million yuan, and the highest can reach 390 million yuan. The highest was in 1931, and the lowest was in 1933. In the past two years, it has been around 290 million yuan. Recently, Mr. Xing Chengxi published an estimate in the Zhongshan Cultural and Educational Institute's special publication, estimating that overseas Chinese remittances in the past five years were over 400 million yuan in 1931; 320 million yuan in 1932; 305 million yuan in 1933; fell to 250 million yuan in 1934; and rose again to 316 million yuan in 1935. Although the estimates of various sources differ in size, the average annual remittance from overseas Chinese is generally around 300 million yuan, which seems to be reasonably accurate. Adding the various offsetting methods above, it should be around 500 million yuan per year. From this, it seems that the 500 million yuan trade deficit can be offset. It should be known that in addition to this, we pay about 100 million yuan in foreign debt each year; the purchase of military supplies and the sending of students to study abroad cost about 50 to 100 million yuan each year. Therefore, offsetting China's international balance of payments is still a problem. The most urgent thing to note is that among the above offsetting methods, only remittances from overseas Chinese are a healthy method. However, this healthy method has been gradually declining due to the everywhere people discrimination against overseas Chinese and other political and economic reasons, which makes us feel the severity of this offsetting problem even more.</p>
<p>From the above explanations, we can know that although a trade deficit is not necessarily harmful to the country in theory, our country's international trade deficit is, first, because the amount is too large and cannot be offset; second, because the imported goods are all daily necessities, consumer goods, and luxury goods, while production tools are very few; from whichever aspect we look at it, it cannot be said to be a sign of promoting collapse for the entire national economy. Therefore, although we cannot uniformly prohibit the use of foreign goods, we hope that everyone will pay attention to Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry's statement: "Production tools are welcome as foreign goods, consumer goods must use domestic goods."

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Opening of the Annual Meeting of the China Cooperation Society</h3>
<p>— Willow</p>
<p>The Chinese cooperative movement began seventeen years ago. Mr. Xue Xianzhou founded the National Cooperative Savings Bank Civilian School, which served as its banner. Since the Nationalist Party came to power, it has been eager to promote cooperative enterprises to achieve the socialization of distribution. Cooperation has been listed as one of the seven major movements. The China Cooperation Society was also established with the advocacy of Mr. Chen Guofu, Mr. Wang Shiying and others. The society takes the investigation, research, promotion, and guidance of cooperative undertakings as its mission. It has been nearly eight years since its establishment. The number of members has increased from twenty-two to four hundred and thirty-six. The society has published the Cooperative Monthly, disseminated cooperative knowledge, guided cooperative operations, established the Xianzhou Library to store cooperative books, jointly organized training classes for cooperative personnel, and promoted cooperative undertakings. These few points have already demonstrated the intensity of its work. The fifth annual meeting of the Cooperative Society was held in Changsha. The members, based on their usual research, should be able to take this opportunity to make many new contributions.</p>
<p>However, the implementation of a business or system must have its foundation. We should guide it by adapting to the circumstances. If the situation is favorable, we should supervise and encourage each other to teach and transform. If the situation is difficult, cooperation in China seems to lack this foundation. However, mutual aid associations are indeed a form of credit cooperation. Community granaries are a form of disaster prevention cooperation. Community schools are a form of educational cooperation. Mutual vigilance and assistance are a form of security cooperation. The land associations (gatherings of neighborhood communities) held in rural areas are a form of local business cooperation. However, their organizations are crude. Although there are rules to follow, they do not suit the complex era of modern personnel affairs. Therefore, when discussing cooperative enterprises today, we should correct the defects and highlight the characteristics of existing systems and enterprises that embody the spirit of cooperation. In new areas, we should conduct in-depth publicity and seek broad public sympathy. We should advance on both fronts, embracing both the new and the old. Although planning may require more effort, it will be easier to achieve results during implementation.</p>
<p>Currently, the most pressing need is how to revitalize the countryside. Those who talk about revitalization often focus on the countryside itself, failing to realize that it is a complete economic issue that cannot be effectively addressed by partial treatment. However, this year, the prices of agricultural products such as soybeans, sesame, wheat, rapeseed, and cotton are all high. Farmers' incomes are higher than in previous years, and their lives are certainly more prosperous. At the same time, rice and grain have recovered greatly. This is truly an opportunity for rural areas to improve. What we are worried about is how to preserve their products and sell them at good prices. If we can plan for storage, transportation, and sales, provide cooperative organizations, and offer economic assistance, guiding them to have hope of success, farmers will naturally be happy to participate. In the past, the China Cooperation Society guided the cooperative enterprises in the Guangfu Temple area, and the results were remarkable. We hope to expand and broaden it, and extend it to various places.</p>
<p>Rural lending is rampant, but how much real benefit can farmers receive? Those who lend certainly have their difficulties. But if they do not break away from the exploitative model, how are they different from those who engage in high-interest loans? The most difficult thing for farmers today is economic injection and turnover. The old mutual aid association system has collapsed in nine out of ten cases due to rural bankruptcy. High-interest loans are harmful to farmers and have been suppressed. As the outcry against high-interest loans grows louder, the avenues for farmers to borrow money become narrower. Since the decline of pawnshops in the market, the value of pawned items has also been depreciated. Farmers cannot obtain what they need for production, nor can they obtain what they need for consumption. This situation has not yet been resolved. Therefore, if we do not plan and remedy the personnel aspects of farmers at the same time, then what is used for production will be in vain. For example, if rural borrowing aims to revitalize the countryside, but there is no intermediary organization, how can the process be fully beneficial? Therefore, supplementing deficiencies and correcting malpractices to benefit farmers is also the contribution of the China Cooperation Society in research and promotion.</p>
<p>We believe that the effectiveness of cooperative undertakings is not limited to this. It is undeniable that grassroots organizations are scattered. It is also difficult to avoid prioritizing personal interests over public interests. The promotion of cooperative undertakings can improve the organization, improve lives, and strengthen the economy. This is what the China Cooperation Society should strive for.</p>
<h3>U.S. Secretary of the Navy Announces: Naval Policy Unchanged; Election Results Will Not Affect; Determined to Achieve Equality with the Strongest Country</h3>
<p>Secretary of the Navy Swanson published an article in the Naval Magazine today, stating that U.S. naval policy will continue regardless of the outcome of the future presidential election. Although the White House occupants may change, the U.S. Navy must be equal to the strongest country. This right has been recognized by people at home and abroad. The recently concluded London Naval Treaty has many omissions. It is difficult to predict the future of naval construction. However, we will not hesitate to engage in naval competition. The conclusion states that if other countries disregard the 1930 London Naval Treaty and build excess warships, our naval strength will be hit and our security will be threatened. We will definitely rise up and compete with them. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>

Since the current government sympathizes with the labor circle, the labor circle also hopes that humanitarian policies can be continued. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<h3>The Current League of Nations Assembly Will Come to a Hasty End; The Disarmament Conference Presidium Meets; The Danzig Issue Asks Poland to Be Cautious; Accuses Britain of Poor Governance in Palestine</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Third Committee of the League of Nations Assembly, namely the Disarmament Committee, held a meeting in the afternoon to discuss the French proposal to convene the presidium of the Disarmament Conference. Representatives from Northern European countries immediately supported this proposal. French representative Boncour then spoke, saying that the most important task of the Disarmament Conference is to limit armaments. The first step is for the countries concerned to publicly announce their military budget figures as much as possible. At this point, British representative MacDonald, the Overseas Dominion Minister, declared that the British military reorganization is intended to ensure the safety of the country and fulfill its responsibilities to the British Empire, and is not used to promote aggressive policies. "If other countries do not agree to reduce military expenditures, Britain will not stop its military expansion plan." (Havas Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The French proposal to reconvene the presidium of the Disarmament Conference is now being discussed by the Third Committee of the League of Nations Assembly, namely the Disarmament Committee. It is reported that representatives from Britain and small countries in Northern Europe have expressed their support for the French proposal. The British and French delegations are currently drafting a resolution on this matter. In addition, the Third Committee will continue to meet on Wednesday this week to discuss. (Havas Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Mandates Commission met today and its members criticized Britain's poor handling of Palestine. Norwegian representative Lange said that the entire Palestine is now a sacrifice to extremist Arab Nationalists and agitators. It is surprising that the trustee country cannot stop the violence. It is now appropriate to convene a special meeting of the Mandates Commission to discuss ways to clean up the situation. The Polish representative then spoke, hoping that Britain would maintain the policy of a Jewish national home, but said that he would propose a proposal to deal with the vast reserved areas for Jews in Northern and Eastern Europe, which is a major issue for Poland.

<p>(Geneva) The Sixth Committee of the League of Nations Assembly, namely the Political Issues Committee, held a meeting this morning to discuss the issue of mandated territories. France was represented by Foreign Minister Weygand. First, Norwegian representative Lange expressed his congratulations on the recent treaty signed between France and Syria (a French mandated territory), which allowed Syria to establish an independent country three years later. However, he expressed concern about the conflict between the Jewish and Arab communities in Palestine. Next, Polish representative Komarnicki, on behalf of the Polish government, expressed the hope that Jewish settlements in Palestine should continue to exist, and that the British government should not prevent Jews from immigrating to Palestine in the future. Weygand then concluded the debate, stating that the British government hoped to find a compromise plan to take care of the legitimate interests of both the Arab and Jewish communities in order to resolve the current disputes.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council recently discussed the issue of the Free City of Danzig. Chairman Rivas of Chile and Lord Cranborne of Britain put forward a draft resolution, which stated, "The League of Nations High Commissioner in Danzig, Rösing (who has been transferred to the position of Deputy Secretary-General of the League of Nations), recently stated in his report that he had encountered various obstacles in performing his duties. The League of Nations Administrative Council hereby requests the Polish government to stop this, so that the guarantees provided by the League of Nations for the current system of the Free City will not become a mere formality. The Council believes that the Danzig issue is of utmost importance and is now preparing to hold a special meeting to discuss it." (Havas Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Danzig. After the League of Nations Administrative Council discussed the issue of the Free City of Danzig yesterday, the local National Socialist Party issued a message saying that League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol had previously telegraphed Graeser, Chairman of the Senate of the city, asking him to send a representative to attend the Administrative Council meeting on the 5th in Geneva. However, this request arrived too late, so a representative could not be sent. Graeser has replied to Avenol, stating that "This Senate deeply approves of the transfer of Rösing, the League of Nations High Commissioner in Danzig, to the position of Deputy Secretary-General of the League of Nations." According to Polish conservatives, there were originally two High Commissioners in Danzig, one appointed by the League of Nations and one appointed by Poland. The League of Nations now plans to merge the two positions into one, and have a Pole take it. It is reported that the current Polish High Commissioner, Pappe, has resigned. (Havas Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Delbos, who came here to attend the League of Nations Assembly, set off today to return to his country. Foreign ministers from various countries attending the League of Nations Assembly, such as Czech Foreign Minister Krofta, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, and British Foreign Secretary Eden, had previously returned home one after another. Now that Delbos is returning to Paris, it seems that although the League of Nations Assembly has not yet closed, the activity in front of the door has greatly cooled down. (Havas Telegram, 5th)</p>

<h3>International Labor Maritime Conference Opens; China Proposes to Include on Agenda Early; Equal Treatment of Seamen, Elimination of Contractor System</h3>
<p>(Geneva) This morning, the International Labor Maritime Conference opened. Zhao Banfu, the Chinese labor representative, submitted a draft proposal, advocating that the case of equal treatment of foreign and domestic seamen should be included on the agenda as soon as possible, so as to formulate a convention to be followed uniformly. He also advocated that the contractor system implemented by foreign shipping companies in China should be abolished. The draft proposal generally stated that the 20th resolution of the International Labor Conference has decided to include the issue of the recruitment and treatment of foreign workers on the agenda as soon as possible, and the International Labor Report also advocates that foreign and domestic seamen should be treated equally to avoid capital from gaining undue benefits through international competition. Foreign shipping companies have been implementing this in China for a long time. Although the Chinese government has adopted strict methods, workers are afraid of losing their jobs and dare not resist even if they are oppressed. It is requested that this conference ask the governments of various countries to cooperate with the Chinese government to abolish this system. (Central News Agency Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Naval Conference convened by the International Labor Conference opened here. A total of 28 countries participated (Germany and Italy did not send representatives).

<p>Budapest. After the bad news of Prime Minister Gömbös' death came, the cabinet immediately held a meeting, chaired by the acting Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture Darányi. After the meeting, the acting Prime Minister also met with Regent Admiral Horthy and submitted the cabinet's resignation. Horthy is scheduled to meet with Cardinal Serédi, National Unity Party leader Iványi, Smallholders Party leader Eckhardt, and former Prime Minister Bethlen this afternoon to discuss candidates to form a cabinet. The entire city lowered flags to half-mast today, and all theaters and cinemas stopped performing. The radio station also stopped broadcasting to express mourning. (Havas Telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Hungarian Minister of Education Dr. Hóman is currently in Germany negotiating a cultural agreement between Germany and Austria. When Prime Minister Gömbös of Hungary was on his deathbed in the city of monks, he immediately reported the bad news of the Prime Minister's death to German leader Hitler, Aviation Minister Göring, and Hungarian Regent Admiral Horthy. Leader Hitler and General Göring immediately telegraphed Admiral Horthy and Mrs. Gömbös to express their condolences. Hóman told reporters that Germany and Hungary have a long-standing friendship.

<h3>Gömbös' Brief Biography</h3>
<p>Munich. Hungarian Prime Minister and Minister of the Army General Gömbös died of illness today at a sanatorium near here, at the age of forty-nine. The general has been a powerful figure in Hungary for nearly seven years. His opponents regarded him as a National Socialist. Although the general tried his best to deny that he intended to implement a dictatorship, he admired Mussolini and Hitler's political skills and did not shy away from it. After going to Germany several times, he would often praise Hitler when talking to people. The general was the son of a village headmaster in a poor village. After graduating from military school, he worked in the Croatian Infantry Regiment. When the European War broke out in 1914, he served as a staff officer in the Chekelic White Army Corps and received the Third Class Medal for his contributions. In 1916, he was wounded during a night attack by the Russian army and returned to Budapest. After recovering, he worked in the Ministry of the Army. He was then ordered to go to Vienna. At that time, he wrote a booklet entitled "The Hungarian Army", advocating the establishment of an independent Hungarian army. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1918, he was ordered to return to the capital. Later, because he was proficient in foreign languages, he went to Cheklike to serve as a military commissioner. At the end of that year, he returned to the capital and was in charge of the so-called "Balkan Regiment" in the Ministry of the Army. Because he opposed the then President, Count Károlyi, he was listed as a retired officer when the Bolshevik Party came to power the following year. He then fled to Vienna and published a counter-revolutionary newspaper called the Hungarian Post. Soon after, he went to Chegeut, the stronghold of the counter-revolutionary "White Army", and served as the head of the White Army government. He was then forced to leave the area by France. While traveling to Vienna, he received news of the collapse of the Hungarian Red government and re-entered the Hungarian army, taking up a certain position. The following year, in 1920, he was elected as a member of parliament. In 1929, he served as Minister of the Army until his death. One year later, he was promoted to General. In 1932, he took the position of Prime Minister and made revising the peace treaty a part of the government's program. His policy was to form a new group of five countries: Germany, Italy, Poland, Austria, and Hungary. The general had recently suffered from heart disease and originally intended to resign today, but he died before he could submit his resignation. (Reuters Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>Implementation of the Italian Currency Devaluation: Germany and Hungary Express Dissatisfaction; Italy Decides to Issue Special Public Bonds to Develop Abyssinian Resources; Pittman Supports Currency Agreement</h3>
<p>(Rome) Yesterday's State Council decided on various measures to be taken when devaluing the currency. The first item stated that property owners, unaffected by the currency devaluation, should immediately subscribe to public bonds in an amount equal to 5% of the property's value. Regarding this, a responsible official has stated that the government has decided to issue special public bonds to be subscribed to by property owners. The funds will be used to develop Abyssinian resources, strengthen national defense expenditures, and levy a property tax to repay the principal and interest on these public bonds. (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Following the devaluation of the Italian lira, the exchange market has temporarily suspended trading. It has now been decided to resume business tomorrow morning. Furthermore, after the implementation of the devaluation measures, the existing clearing agreements between Italy and other countries have automatically ceased to be effective. From now on, they should be implemented in accordance with the new lira exchange rate. (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Rome) After the government decided to devalue the lira, it immediately notified the other two signatory countries of the Rome Agreement, namely Austria and Hungary, stating that the government would continue to maintain and promote mutual trade between Austria, Hungary, and Italy. (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The financial circles here were not surprised by the news of the Italian lira devaluation. The financial circles here had already anticipated the devaluation of the lira when the Italian government announced that it would hold a State Council meeting today. Economic figures here believe that Italy's move "may contribute to peace," as it shows that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini intends to participate in international joint efforts to develop international trade through mutual coordination among countries. If this is the case, its impact on the overall situation will be significant. Furthermore, Italy's foreign trade was previously restricted due to special measures taken by the government. In the future, the lira devaluation will greatly increase export trade. (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) People here are very surprised and uneasy after Italy devalued its currency and reduced import taxes. Responsible officials have stated that, except for coal, most of Germany's exports to Italy are manufactured goods. Although Italy has reduced import taxes on raw materials and food, it will not benefit German exports. Furthermore, Germany's economic policy is based on self-sufficiency and is maintained by the government's use of dictatorial power to implement a sound economic system. Now that Italy has devalued its currency, Germany is the only major industrial country that maintains the current value of its currency, and its economic policy has become isolated, causing a psychological blow. (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) After the Italian government implemented the currency devaluation, it immediately notified Austria and Hungary, expressing its willingness to continue close cooperation with those countries. Political figures here have expressed great interest in this statement, saying that the meeting to be held here at the beginning of the month by the foreign ministers of Italy, Austria, and Hungary is becoming increasingly important. In addition, Finance Minister Traslau and National Bank President Kienbock discussed the new international monetary situation last night. According to political figures' predictions, although many in Austrian industry and commerce advocate for the devaluation of the Austrian schilling, it is unlikely to become a reality. However, the government may take some remedial measures, such as subsidizing exports and reducing import taxes. (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Budapest) The Italian currency devaluation could have a major impact on Hungary, as Hungary exports a large number of goods to Italy and is therefore a creditor to Italy. After the lira devaluation, the clearing business between Italy and Hungary has automatically stopped, and as a result, Italy's purchases from Hungary will inevitably decrease. Political figures here believe that although the Italian government has stated that it must maintain trade with Hungary and promote its development, if the currency devaluation measures have a negative impact on Hungary, then Hungary will have to turn to Germany and try to develop trade as a means of damage control. (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(New York) US Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently issued a statement saying, "The signing of the currency agreement between the United Kingdom, France, and the United States is the greatest achievement of President Roosevelt's tenure. After the signing of this agreement, there is no need to pass new laws in Congress." Pittman also said that when the London Conference was held in 1933, it was not possible to stabilize the exchange rates of various currencies, because the United Kingdom was unwilling to raise the exchange rate of the pound, and France also refused to devalue the franc. Therefore, the general atmosphere was very unfavorable. The Republican Party used this to accuse President Roosevelt, saying that Roosevelt was primarily responsible for the failure of the London Economic Conference, which can be said to be extremely unfair. Even according to the estimate of Harrison of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, it was impossible to stabilize the currencies of various countries at that time. (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Government officials expressed their views today, saying that the Italian currency devaluation can enhance the effectiveness of the currency agreement between the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. Generally speaking, this move can be regarded as another step towards restoring international currency values to the proportions in the early post-war period. (National News Agency, 5th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebel Army Launches General Offensive on Land, Sea, and Air; Madrid's Position Perilous; Government Army Decides on Desperate Last Stand</h3>
<p>(Madrid) Rebel forces today launched a fierce attack on the left flank of the government army's defense line in Navalperal, but retreated to their original positions due to the strong resistance of the government army. This is the prelude to the rebel army's three-pronged attack on the capital. (National News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>(Madrid) The government authorities have recently received successive victories from various routes, and the prospects for the war have become optimistic. 150,000 rebel soldiers are about to attack the capital. The government has now taken various measures to resist, such as tens of thousands of new troops who have arrived here from Valencia Province in the southeast and will immediately join the front-line operations. The government has also ordered a ban on the export of gold and silver, and people leaving the country are only allowed to carry a small amount of cash, otherwise they will be severely fined. Valuable metals stored by the people should also be deposited in banks to replenish the national treasury. In addition, all residents of the city must be prepared for rebel air raids. Many motorized bicycles are now equipped with huge loudspeakers that patrol the city. As soon as rebel planes are spotted, they will issue a warning to residents. Loudspeakers everywhere will also respond at the same time, so that residents can immediately take shelter in cellars. (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>

<h3>Casualties in the Spanish Civil War Reach 138,000</h3>

<h3>British Labour Party Congress Supports Neutral Policy on Spanish Civil War</h3>
<p>(Edinburgh) The Labour Party Congress today passed a resolution supporting the government's non-interference policy in the Spanish Civil War by a majority of 1,836,000 votes to 519,000 votes. There was a lengthy debate before the vote. Greenwood, Secretary of the Labour Party's Information Department, told the delegates that this policy had been acknowledged as the responsibility of the leader of the French Popular Front government, Léon Blum. The initiator of this policy was the Blum government, and it was endorsed by Soviet Russia. At present, all European public opinion, whether socialist or non-socialist, recognizes the non-interference policy as a genuine way out in an extremely serious situation. At the opening of the Labour Party Congress, the riots that occurred in London yesterday immediately aroused repercussions. Morrison, former chairman of the Labour Party Congress, put forward a resolution requesting the government to immediately investigate the recent riots and the activities and financial resources of the British fascist organizations. The entire meeting unanimously passed the resolution. Discussions on the government's rearmament policy will begin in the near future. The national defense proposal that has been included in the agenda contains the following: "The Congress, in view of the threatening attitude of autocratic countries around the world, which are massively increasing their armaments, disregarding international law, and refusing to join the work of organizing peace, hereby declares that the military strength of the countries of the League of Nations must be determined by the military strength of the aggressors. The Congress hereby reaffirms that the Labour Party's policy of maintaining national defense is in line with the responsibilities that member states of the League of Nations should bear. Its purpose is to preserve the rights and freedoms of the people, uphold democracy, and abide by international law. The Labour Party recognizes the relationship between foreign policy and armaments and believes that the government's past performance is extremely pitiful. Therefore, it expresses its refusal to take responsibility for a purely competitive armaments policy. The Congress reserves its complete freedom to criticize the current government's rearmament and believes that continued investment in private arms manufacturing is a major threat to world peace."

<h3>Ministry of Finance: Land Transportation Inspection Office Moved to Tianjin; Branch Office Established in Datong to Intercept Smuggled Goods; Customs Commissioners of Tianjin and Qinhuangdao Changed</h3>
<p>(Tianjin Communication) The anti-smuggling measures in North China have not yet been finalized. Li Tong, Deputy Director of the Land Transportation Inspection Office, is still in Tianjin awaiting orders from the Ministry of Finance after coming to North China to investigate. Whether the General Inspection Office will move north is expected to be decided clearly by the central government within the next week. According to Li Tong's interviews with various authorities in North China and responsible persons of the Tianjin Customs, he summarized the opinions of all parties and believed that with the establishment of inspection branch offices in various places, smugglers have found it difficult to transport goods, and the amount of smuggled goods has gradually decreased. However, the environment in Tianjin is special, and the puppet regime in Eastern Hebei has not been abolished for a while. Smuggled goods have thus taken Tianjin as their source and are being forcibly sold to the hinterland of Hebei and Chahar. In September, the total value of goods sold was 2,025,000 yuan, including 66,000 bags of sugar, 5,000 boxes of rayon, 5,000 boxes of kerosene, 3,000 boxes of wool fabrics, and 4,500 pieces of miscellaneous marine goods. The amount is truly staggering. Although there are customs three-point checkpoints in the suburbs of Tianjin, originally intended to take a sealing-off approach and prevent smuggled goods from being transported out of Tianjin, since their establishment, in addition to increasing the customs' financial burden, they have not achieved any effect. Japanese smugglers all use military trucks with heavy loads, insert the Japanese flag, and break through the tax checkpoints, refusing to listen to any obstruction or inspection. Although the Tianjin municipal police have come out to assist, there is no way to deal with the Japanese smugglers who are armed and difficult to deal with. Forcibly executing the law will inevitably lead to a bloody tragedy. Therefore, customs officers are becoming increasingly timid, and smuggling is becoming more rampant and unscrupulous. The private goods on the Ping-Sui Railway have, in the past month, because of the completion of the Zhang-Duo Highway, all abandoned the method of using the railway for transportation and switched to loading long-distance buses, starting from Rehe and transferring to the Northwest along the Zhang-Duo Highway. Daily necessities with surprisingly cheap prices have been found in Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and western Suiyuan provinces. Only because transportation in that area is difficult, the sales market has not been smooth. Based on this situation, Li Tong telegraphed to the central government, with an accompanying suggestion, requesting that the General Inspection Office be moved to Tianjin first. Although it will not be possible to eliminate the source and completely eliminate the path of smuggling, it is undeniable that smugglers take Tianjin as their base camp. At present, smuggling in Jiangnan is no longer rampant, only smuggling in Hebei is still the same. If the source of smuggled goods in Tianjin is blocked, then although smuggling cannot be completely eliminated for a while, it can be gradually reduced due to inconvenient sales. In addition, since there is no private goods transportation on the Ping-Sui Railway, the establishment of a branch office can be eliminated. However, since they have been found in Gansu, Suiyuan, Qinghai, and Ningxia, in addition to ordering the authorities of each province to strictly prevent and block them, another inspection branch office should be established in Datong to replace the former Changguan and intercept smuggled goods from invading and selling. If all places outside Hebei Province can adopt the form of a large encirclement and strictly block them, the General Inspection Office can be moved to Tianjin to assist the customs in removing the roots of private traffickers and gradually reduce the sales channels of smuggled goods. Given a reasonable amount of time, it may be possible to eradicate them completely. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance quite agrees, and the movement of the General Office to Tianjin may become a reality. In the future, An Sier will come to Tianjin to preside over everything, and Li Tong will be stationed in Tianjin for a long time, coordinating the affairs of the Ping-Han and Jin-Pu branch offices.</p>
<p>As for the work of the Inspection Office, it has generally been decided internally, and it will be implemented after the official order is issued. As for the Tianjin and Qinhuangdao customs themselves, the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly received reports that Customs Commissioner Xu Liya of Tianjin Customs and Customs Commissioner Morley of Qinhuangdao Customs are unsuitable for the place and are also mostly perfunctory in their work. In order to improve the organization of the customs themselves and strengthen their external strength, Mei Weiliang, Customs Commissioner of the Jianghan Customs, and Dukes, Customs Commissioner of the Wenzhou Customs, were specially transferred to serve as Customs Commissioners of the Tianjin and Qinhuangdao Customs, respectively. Mei Weiliang arrived in Tianjin on the 4th and took over on the 5th. Dukes will arrive in Qinhuangdao around the 10th to take office. After the two customs are reorganized by the Ministry of Finance, they will jointly assume responsibility with the General Inspection Office, and there should be thorough measures to suppress smuggling. The inspection offices set up in Hebei and Chahar were previously discussed by Li Qingxuan when he came to the north, and they should specialize in suppressing military fire, drugs, and bandits, and they must follow this route. There is no conflict with the authority of the customs. Gu Cun's supplemental tax on smuggled goods in Tianjin established a committee to be responsible for investigation and liquidation. Although Li Qingxuan has reported to the Ministry of Finance, how the supplemental tax rate should be stipulated is also a matter of great research. Because the authorities of Hebei and Chahar had said in advance that they would allow the Japanese to pay 1/8 of the regular customs tax, the Ministry of Finance intends to believe that it is already showing generosity to let them pay the full regular tax rate and release the goods without investigating the crime of smuggling. If it is lower than the customs tax rate, it is absolutely impossible. Therefore, the establishment of this meeting is still in doubt. (5th)</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Vladivostok Expelled and Returned to China; Refugees Talk About the Cruel Circumstances of Their Expulsion</h3>
<p>(Qingdao Communication) In recent years, our overseas Chinese compatriots have been expelled and returned to the country due to the exclusion of foreign ethnic groups. Now, the Chinese compatriots living in Vladivostok have been expelled and returned to the country. More than a dozen refugees, all over the age of 50, who arrived in Qingdao by ship from Yantai yesterday, the oldest of whom was named Yu Peicai, aged 75, wandered the streets after arriving in Qingdao because they were unfamiliar with the place and no one took them in, which was extremely pitiful. After being spotted by police officers from the 10th Police Station of the 1st Public Security Bureau, they were immediately brought to the station for questioning and learned that they were Chinese compatriots who had been expelled from Vladivostok. They were sent to the Taihe Inn on Tai'an Road to spend the night and promised to ask the Social Affairs Bureau for relief on their behalf. According to them, the circumstances of their expulsion were extremely cruel. I will now record the refugees' talks. I went to Guandong 20 years ago to make a living. At that time, it was the most popular thing for people from Shandong. Young people in general were eager to cross the north. Indeed, those who went to Guandong at that time were very rich. When we went, we were all around 20 years old, and we always sent home two or three hundred yuan every year. Unexpectedly, after the September 18th Incident, we could no longer survive. All kinds of donations, taxes, and insurances were really a hassle. That's not all. The most deadly thing is that you are given a crime for no reason. Lightly, you will be put in a big prison, and heavily, you will be shot. Originally, you could earn about one yuan a day, but after the incident, it was reduced to less than 30 cents. After paying the donations and taxes, you simply didn't have enough to eat. Because there was no way, we transferred to Vladivostok in Russia. When we first arrived, it was easy to earn money, and we could earn two or three yuan a day. Later, I heard that it was occupied by some party, and the treatment of overseas Chinese was extremely cruel. We were simply put in a prison again. Not only was the salary reduced by more than half, but the money earned had to be spent on the same day, and no extra money was allowed. When we go out to make a living, who doesn't have parents, wives, and children at home? Who doesn't want to save a few dollars to take home? It's strange that as long as you have a line, they will definitely find it, and the result is a big prison. They can arbitrarily stipulate ten or twenty years. Therefore, there are no less than hundreds of thousands of Chinese people in Vladivostok who are in prison. This is not a big deal. Since this spring, they don't want Chinese people at all. When you are working, they will grab your ear and tell you to leave. No money or luggage is allowed to be carried. Every day, there must be thousands of Chinese people who suddenly become homeless. It's really pitiful. Fortunately, we have a consul there, so we can find a way to send us back. Originally, we should have passed through the three northeastern provinces to return to the country, but the laws stipulated by the puppet state are very strict. If we pass through that place without a passport, we will be shot if we are caught. Therefore, the consul told us to go from Vladivostok to Shanghai. There are two decisions every month. Each decision can transport more than 500 people. Now, no less than tens of thousands of people have been expelled and returned to the country. After we arrived in Shanghai, because we are from Shandong, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau sent us by ship to Yantai. There were more than 50 people who arrived in Yantai this time. Because we are very close to Qingdao, the Yantai Red Swastika Society sent us on the Maoli ship. We arrived in Qingdao at 3 pm today (the 4th). We ate a full meal at the Yantai Red Swastika Society yesterday, and we haven't eaten since. He couldn't help but sigh.</p>
<h3>Pine River: Fellow Tradesmen Violently Chopped with Axes</h3>
<p>Wu Changchu, a Wuxi native, 31 years old, was a partner in the Qiande Tai carpentry shop west of Xiuye Bridge. Previously, because the industry guild and the county middle school were connected, the school expanded its campus, exchanging land in another place with the industry and adding 240 yuan. It was unexpected that this money would be used privately. Wu Changchu had submitted a report to the county government, requesting a thorough investigation and recovery, which caused resentment from those who divided the money. They repeatedly hinted to Wu that if he did not stop submitting and urging, he would be in trouble. Unexpectedly, at around 10 pm last night (the 5th), Wu Changchu was returning to the store from east to west when several people flashed out of the Dongbaidu Lane. They chopped Wu's head, shoulders, and back with axes. The axe on the back of his head caused the most serious injury. Wu recognized that they were his fellow tradesmen Du Jiangying, Xie Aquan, Chun Gen, Yang, and five others whose names he did not know. Seeing that Wu was injured, they immediately fled. Passers-by informed Wu Changchu's store to send someone to carry him to Joseph Hospital for treatment. It is heard that the perpetrators have now asked someone to come forward to mediate, but the local public security police station is still investigating the perpetrators.</p>
<h3>Kunshan: Male Corpse Found Strangled</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 5th, an unidentified male corpse was found in the river west of Han Bridge, No. 90 Hukun Highway near Qingyang Port in the county. He was about 30 years old. The villagers discovered and reported to the police district, and telegraphed the county government to send someone to examine the body. The male corpse had a white belt tied around his neck. The skin color of his whole body was pale white, his eyes were closed, and water was seeping from his nostrils. There were scars on his right foot and back. It was obvious that he had been strangled to death before being pushed into the river. The corpse was ordered to be collected by the Baolizhang first, and the murderer was strictly arrested to be dealt with according to the law.</p>
<h3>Taicang: The Heroic Act of Strong Men Dredging the River</h3>
<p>The original Yicang River inside the Xiaobeimen of this city has been desolate for many years and has become a flat land. However, because this area is the district where the county's organs are concentrated, fire protection is particularly inconvenient. The county government has prepared a plan for the strong men of the first district to be responsible for dredging. From the 5th to the 7th, the work was completed. The strong men worked bravely and were not afraid of hardship, which is a heroic act.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Year of Abundance Reports Sounds of Famine</h3>
<p>This year's harvest is abundant, unseen in many years. However, due to wind and insect disasters in a small number of rural areas, reports of famine have been submitted to the county. The county government has instructed Yan Hongsheng, the accounting director of Wujiang, to conduct on-site inspections in Xiangcheng Weiting and other areas on the 4th and 5th. The results show that the losses in the above two areas are minimal, and in some cases, the disaster-stricken areas cannot be identified. Yesterday (the 6th), Commissioner Yan went to the Mu Hu Guan and other areas for inspection, which is expected to be completed today (the 7th). The situation will be reported to the Finance Department to determine the quality of the autumn harvest. Deng Jie, the accounting director of Wu County, went to Wujiang for inspection on the 6th. Furthermore, in the Chefang area, the early rice harvest is about 80%, while the late rice has suffered more severely due to the devastation of heavy fog, wind, rain, and extreme heat. The area has already reported to the county and requested a joint inspection with the owners to determine the quality.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Stout Men's Team Maintains Winter Defense</h3>
<p>The First District Office, following the county's promulgated "Elimination Measures," emphasizes stout men's patrols. With the winter defense period approaching, the office plans to organize the trained stout men in the district into a stout men's team to maintain local security. This was proposed for discussion at yesterday's district affairs meeting. It was unanimously agreed that maintaining local security starts with eliminating scattered bandits. Township heads should consider the local situation and distribute the number of stout men according to the promulgated measures. At the same time, opinions should be added to the organization of self-defense groups and reported to the district office for approval.</p>
<h3>Gloomy Future for the Silk Market</h3>
<p>This year's autumn cocoon harvest is extremely poor in both Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and the silk reeling is also inferior to that of the spring cocoons. However, due to the small output, the price of cocoons has risen, exceeding the prescribed purchase price by nearly ten yuan. Therefore, cocoon merchants are deeply concerned about the risk of losses, and the money industry is also advocating caution regarding loan collateral. Weighing is now uniformly carried out everywhere. Recently, international trade in Chinese silk has been affected by the dumping of Japanese silk, resulting in a sharp decline in transactions and a sharp drop in prices. B-grade standard silk has fallen to 600 yuan upon entering customs. Domestic silk factories, due to the current situation, dare not purchase it. As a result, silk sales are extremely sluggish, and the market outlook is very bleak.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Malignant Malaria Prevalent in Various Townships</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn, a type of malignant malaria has been prevalent in various townships in Muyi. It is even more widespread in the eastern townships. According to Chinese medicine diagnoses, it is typhoid fever. In the various townships of the Sixth District, sufferers are everywhere, and the situation is quite severe. Many patients die without being saved. The duration of the illness is often five or six days, and some die in as little as two or three days. When they first fall ill, patients can still sit up, but when it becomes severe, it is impossible to save them.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Order from the Department to Dismantle and Reduce the Coal Wharf</h3>
<p>The Jingjiang County Party Headquarters reported that the Zhongxing Coal Wharf in Huangtiangang Port, Jiangyin, protrudes into the river, forcing the water flow to the north, and the embankment on the north bank is collapsing severely. The Construction Department sent engineer Zhou Kebao to Cheng the day before yesterday to conduct an on-site inspection with local officials from Jiangyin and Jingjiang counties. Upon returning to the province, he reported that the wharf's impact on changing the river flow was small, but it was prone to silting, which had a significant impact. Based on the report, the Construction Department ordered the Jiangyin County Magistrate to independently implement the dismantling and reduction and report it for verification.</p>
<h3>Huaiyin: Traveler Brutally Kills Innkeeper</h3>
<p>Zhou Qian, who runs the Changfa Inn outside the North Wei Gate in Wangying Town, the Third District of this county, was suddenly approached by five unfamiliar strangers on the evening of the 2nd, who claimed to be lodging. To their surprise, in the middle of the night, Zhou Qian was suddenly hacked in the chest with an axe, suffering serious injuries and dying. Two of the five lodgers escaped, and the other three also left one after another. Zhou Qian's daughter, upon discovering the incident, immediately reported it to the township office. On the morning of the 3rd, District Chief Shi Dongshan went to investigate and immediately reported it to the county government to send personnel to conduct an autopsy. The autopsy revealed that Zhou Qian's left ear, left face, and brain were all hacked open, with blood splattered everywhere. The scene was extremely tragic. However, the identity of the murderer is currently difficult to determine.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Abduction of Bride Results in Tragedy</h3>
<p>Hu Xiulai, a resident of the northern township of the Seventh District of this county, had a second daughter named Er Guniang, who was twenty years old. She had been betrothed to the son of Hao Sanmao in her childhood. Hao's son had been serving in the military for many years with no news. This spring, Hu decided to marry his daughter to the son of Li Dapei, a wealthy merchant in Lingzhen, and the wedding was imminent. Unexpectedly, Hao's son returned home the day before yesterday and learned that his fiancée had been betrothed to someone else and the wedding was about to take place. On the evening of the 2nd, Hao's son gathered a group of people and went to his future in-laws' house by boat to abduct the bride. After successfully getting the girl back on the boat, Hu sounded the alarm, and villagers gathered and rushed to the Xiaoyang Port where the boat was docked. They rescued Hu's daughter. Hao's son and his men were outnumbered and the boat sank into the lake. Li San drowned because he did not know how to swim. On the morning of the 3rd, the incident was reported to the Fifth Police Substation, and Hao's son was arrested. A formal lawsuit has been filed.</p>
<h3>Taizhou: Notorious Bandit in the Southern District Executed</h3>
<p>Ye Zhikun, a notorious bandit in the southern district of Wenling, was 44 years old. He surrendered and reformed in 1931, but later re-formed a gang, gathered at sea, and robbed merchant ships. He was subsequently arrested by the local defense team and escorted to the county government. After a thorough interrogation and confirmation of the facts, he was sentenced to death according to law. After approval from higher authorities, a team was dispatched to Songmen Town in the southern district at 8:00 AM on the 2nd to carry out the execution by firing squad as a warning.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Major Accident on the Hanghui Road</h3>
<p>The Hangtun Intermodal Passenger Bus on the Hanghui Highway left Hangzhou for Tunxi at 7:00 AM yesterday. When it reached the Linxia Village area of Changhua County, a nearby farmer named Chen, who was over 50 years old, was walking on the highway and was unable to avoid the bus. He was knocked down and seriously injured by the car. He was sent to the county hospital for treatment, but died at 4:00 PM. Also, the Hangwei Company's #2135 freight car, which was carrying soldiers from She County to Changhua to suppress bandits, fell from a mountain ridge that was five or six stories high in the Yuling Pass area at 4:00 PM this afternoon due to the driver's negligence. Two people died instantly, and seventeen people were seriously injured. The driver was also injured and is currently being treated at the Hangzhou Municipal Hospital.</p>
<h3>Bengbu: Reducing the Salt Tax in Sanhejian</h3>
<p>The Henan Sales and Tax Bureau reported to the Ministry of Finance that the Sanhejian area is adjacent to the low-tax area of northern Anhui, which is prone to smuggling. It proposed to reduce the sales tax on Huai salt transported by river in the area by one yuan per dan and reduce the sales tax on salt carried by shoulder by nine jiao per dan for a six-month trial period to increase sales and enrich tax revenue. The Ministry of Finance approved the report and ordered the General Inspectorate to inform the Lianghuai Salt Transport Envoy. The Bengbu Tax Collection Office has received this clear order.</p>

<h3>Chen Jitang and Hu Wenhu</h3>
<p>— Xu Shu</p>
<p>The ship arrived in Hong Kong and then departed. There were many people seeing it off at the pier, with red and green paper streamers hanging all along the ship's railing. From here to Singapore is a journey of three days and one night, starting at 4:00 PM on August 30th.</p>
<p>Two more famous Chinese figures boarded the ship's first-class cabin: Chen Jitang and Hu Wenhu. The former is a defeated hero, taking a lot of money abroad; the latter is a successful wealthy man, returning to his old home in Singapore. I have some inexplicable feelings about these two famous people.</p>
<p>The day before arriving in Singapore, the students had a gathering. Someone suggested that when in Singapore, they should invite Mr. Hu Wenhu to give some guidance and to extend some hospitality, and also visit his businesses in Singapore. To be honest, these newly fledged Chinese children wanted to squeeze some money out of this overseas Chinese millionaire who is very enthusiastic about everything in China. They also wanted to get to know this great man whose industries are declining but whose evergreen spirit remains.</p>
<p>News of the meeting reached the first-class cabin. I heard that General Chen suspected it was a meeting against him or something, and felt very uneasy, sending people to inquire from all sides. This hero, who was invincible in Guangzhou, felt fear at a meeting of fifty students on this white ship. This kind of mentality is something we cannot understand, nor can our compatriots in the country understand, I think.</p>
<p>The procedure for contacting Mr. Hu Wenhu was to write him a letter first, but after waiting for two days without a reply, they had to send a representative to see him. However, Mr. Hu Wenhu was very cold, first saying that there was nothing to do in Singapore, and second that time was tight and he could not entertain them. Anyway, he didn't know how to say it. Mr. Hu only speaks Cantonese, and we could only communicate with him through a Cantonese dialect speaker. As a result, he said that if it wasn't too much trouble, he might send a clerk and a large car to accompany and guide them when possible.</p>
<p>However, Singapore arrived at 6:00 AM the next day, and until 9:00 AM, neither the clerk nor the car came. Nothing was very certain, so who would patiently wait for an unreliable opportunity?</p>
<p>We took a car to the Botanical Garden. Because there was no prior organization and there were many people, things were not well arranged. We went to the museum in a hurry. The museum was originally named Raffles Library. Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles was the first builder of Singapore. This museum has a bit of a memorial character to him, so there is a statue of him at the entrance.</p>
<p>The museum has a wide collection of things. The history and culture of the Malay people, and other valuable equipment and utensils, are displayed in a very complete way. Malay culture is very similar to Chinese culture in many ways. We can compare many things. Ships and weapons were very developed early on. The carvings on the sword handles and the production of many metal inlays were perfected very early on. However, their people, those who are slightly knowledgeable and advanced, have become Europeanized, and there is no longer any Eastern personality.</p>
<p>After leaving the museum, we took rickshaws to eat. Rickshaws here can seat two people. I sat in one with Professor Zhao Renqiao from Tsinghua University. Although Mr. Zhao is a bit fat, I am thin, but even with both of us sitting down, it still felt too narrow. I thought this might be specially designed for a man and a woman to sit together.</p>
<p>The majority of people wanted to eat Chinese food. They hadn't eaten Chinese food for five days, and they all wanted to eat it. As for me, I didn't need it yet. First, because many people treated me to meals when I left, the aftertaste hadn't faded. Second, because I am used to living in the north and love to eat wheat-based foods. I am afraid that the only restaurants here are Cantonese restaurants, and I am most afraid of Cantonese food, so I didn't feel any interest.</p>
<p>Singapore's currency is half more expensive than Hong Kong's, and naturally even more expensive than Shanghai's. Although there were many of us, we didn't drink alcohol or choose expensive dishes, but it still cost more than fourteen yuan. Fourteen yuan is close to thirty yuan in Shanghai money, which would be enough to eat a good meal in Shanghai. —Thinking like this, it's no wonder that Mr. Hu Wenhu was unwilling to treat us.</p>
<p>When we went there, we took a car, passing through many streets, and also passed Mr. Hu Wenhu's home. Mr. Hu's home is a very nice Western-style house, but the inside and outside of the gate are decorated with several large and small stone-made colorful tigers and leopards made of cement. The name Hu Wenhu is engraved under the tiger, and the name Hu Wenbao is engraved under the leopard, making them even more eye-catching. The billboards on the street are all Tiger Balm tiger trademarks. Occasionally, a car would pass by, with a tiger standing on the roof and advertisements on the car cover. This shows Mr. Hu Wenhu's status in Singapore.</p>
<p>According to people who know, Mr. Hu is an overseas Chinese who has been making and selling Chinese secret recipes in the tropics for generations. When the rubber tree industry was booming, many people seized the opportunity, but Mr. Hu was not moved at all and still wholeheartedly devoted himself to the Tiger Balm business. Year after year, at a time when many rubber industry operators were going bankrupt, he showed even greater financial strength.</p>
<p>Walking back from the street, I felt an unspeakable emotion about Singapore's clean municipality. All of this Europeanized architecture and layout has long lost the elegant and exquisite Eastern culture of the Malay people in the museum. The only remnants on this island under British rule, which can be said to be a symbol of Eastern culture, are the simple colorful tigers and leopards on the walls of Mr. Hu Wenhu's residence, company cars, and signboards. I had met Mr. Hu Wenhu on the ship. This robust, well-dressed wealthy businessman is trying to preserve this Chinese Dragon Boat Festival trademark, which is indeed not easy.</p>
<p>Under the economic strategies of imperialism here, only Mr. Hu still exists unyieldingly, which is already an amazing feat. But Tiger Balm can only be sold among the Chinese, Malays, and Indians. What other feelings do I have about this outstanding wealthy businessman? The piers are full of small stalls selling shirts, pants, socks, and other items from Chinese hawkers, while the warships of the great British Empire stand tall in the harbor. Heavens, what time is it? It is already dusk. Leaning on the railing of the white Italian ship, I couldn't help but think of my distant homeland. But then I immediately thought, after Mr. Hu Wenhu went ashore, in the grand and magnificent first-class cabin salon, I am afraid that there would only be three or four Chinese people including General Chen, right? They sit on the deck, looking out the window, what kind of feelings will they have about this poor and backward homeland? (September 8, 1936, on the Indian Ocean).</p>

<h3>Disturbance Occurs at Chuzhong, Two Classes of Students Leave School, Situation Further Escalates</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Chuzhou Junior High School held a Boy Scout group this semester. For the sake of uniform attire, on September 30th, tailors were ordered to measure and make woolen overcoats (at a price of more than ten yuan each). The third-year students, because they were about to graduate soon and had already made cotton overcoats last year, politely requested to be exempted from measurement in order to save money and reduce the burden on their parents and elders. Principal Zhao Zhongsu then forcibly imposed sanctions and said that anyone who dared to resist would be expelled. Soon, the entire class of third-year students also opposed this matter and left the school entirely at around 5:00 PM on October 1st. Principal Zhao immediately identified the initiating student, Chen Faxiang, and threatened him with beatings, ordering him to reveal the names of his accomplices and ordering the students to leave the school immediately. Chen Faxiang was also taken to the Public Security Bureau by the police and detained. On the morning of the 2nd, the entire class of first-year students also left the school. The situation has further escalated, and mediation by the local authorities is quite difficult.</p>

<h3>Vanden-Wyns' Visit to Shanghai for Performances: Only One Night's Stay, Performances Unlikely to Happen</h3>
<p>World professional tennis players Thierlden Van Wyns and Miss Haber and others arrived in Tokyo, Japan, the day before yesterday (the 5th). According to Kanafanolo, the professional tennis player who contracted Thierlden's visit to Shanghai for performances, he has now received a telegram from Thierlden stating that he is scheduled to take the President Lincoln liner to Shanghai at the beginning of next month and arrive on the 6th. He will take the original liner to Hong Kong on the 7th and will only stay for one night. He will arrive in Manila on the 10th and depart for Australia on the 13th. As for the performance in Shanghai, Thierlden's performance dates in Manila and Australia have been decided in advance, so he cannot stay in Shanghai for a longer period of time. He will only stay for one day when he passes through Shanghai and will leave on the original ship on the day of his arrival. The Lincoln is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at about 11:00 AM, and he can attend the performance in the afternoon. It was originally scheduled to be held at the Kajun Stadium at 153 Shengmuyuan Road, but it is not worth demolishing many existing buildings for only one day of performance. Therefore, a vacant lot has now been found, which is the property of Puyi Real Estate Company and can accommodate 4,000 spectators. Construction will begin soon.</p>

<h3>Impressions of Attending the World Games and Touring Europe: A Comprehensive View of the Football Championship</h3>
<p>— Li Huitang</p>
<p>The football championship was also one of the important programs at this year's Summer Olympic Games, and the ticket revenue from the matches accounted for a superior position in the Games' financial resources. Just the last four matches at the main venue of the Games attracted nearly 400,000 spectators. The richness of the revenue can be imagined. Now the Games have become a thing of the past, and the football championship also has a destination. However, most of the information about this event is in German, and the communications we received are also brief and incomplete. Here, I will rely on my brainpower to supplement the facts I have seen, heard, and known. I believe that football fans who care about football will not be bothered and will be happy to read it.</p>
<p>Here, let me first tabulate the results of the All-World Football Championship (from the 3rd to the 6th) (from the 7th to the 8th) (from the 10th to the 11th) (the 15th) (Note) The third and fourth place finals were moved to Norway to defeat Poland three to two. (The 13th) × The symbol indicates overtime.</p>
<p>The symbol indicates that Peru originally defeated Austria four to two, but it was deemed not to comply with the current regulations, and a rematch was ordered. Peru refused to accept and eventually did not appear on the field. Austria gained the right to rematch for free.</p>
<p>A total of sixteen countries participated in this event. The championship was a single-elimination system. Sixteen happened to be a perfect number. No country had a bye when the draw was made. The strong teams from South America, such as Uruguay (the previous champion) and Argentina, did not send teams to participate due to conflicts with amateur rules. Only Peru came from afar. On the European side, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Yugoslavia, and other countries also stopped participating due to salary issues during the holidays, which reduced a lot of interest. Initially, it was hoped that 30 countries would participate, but in the end there were only 16 units. A total of 15 matches were played to find the winner of the championship.</p>
<p>Looking at the results and scores of the second week in the table above, there are several places where the strength gap is obvious. But it was different in the semi-finals. Almost all of the last four matches were resolved in overtime. The intensity of the match and the closeness of the strength can be imagined. Regarding the football skills of various countries, there are similar formations, and there are also different strategies. There are measures that we are accustomed to, and there are also kicking methods that are new to us. In various forms, there is indeed a need for research and learning. For example, the "third defender" formation adopted by Norway, "Third back game", is not only unimaginable in our country, but has never been seen anywhere in the eastern hemisphere. I hope that I will have free time and a good mood to write in more detail about the more interesting football strategies and the characteristics of each team, so that compatriots who care about football can jointly study the merits and demerits and perhaps improve the current level of football in our country through research. (To be continued)</p>
<p>University Table Tennis Tournament</p>
<p>First Joint Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Table Tennis Federation held its first joint meeting at Fudan University at 4:00 PM on the 5th to discuss matters related to the second "University Cup" competition.

Guanghua was elected as the standing committee, Fudan as the competition group, and the Business College as the accounting. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM after the discussion.</p>
<p>Registration for the City No. 1 Stadium Industrial and Commercial Football League Begins: The Industrial and Commercial Amateur Football League, held annually at the City No. 1 Stadium, has been held for seven sessions.

As Chairman Chiang's birthday is rapidly approaching, the committee yesterday remitted 330,000 national currency dollars through the Shanghai Municipal Bank to the Nanking Chiang Kai-shek Birthday Aircraft Donation Committee. Additionally, over 100,000 dollars transferred from the former China Aviation Association upon its dissolution was also included as part of Shanghai's donation to purchase aircraft as a birthday gift. It is reported that the remaining donations will be remitted on the 25th of this month. All sectors and organizations are urged to expedite the submission of their donations. Furthermore, the Shanghai Municipal Association is actively preparing for the naming ceremony and presentation ceremony of the purchased aircraft, and a meeting will be held at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA at 5:00 PM on the 8th of this month to discuss the proceedings with all sectors, agencies, organizations, and schools.</p>
<p>Since July 15th, the various districts, map units, and Baojia units in the city have been actively soliciting donations to purchase aircraft as a birthday gift, making commendable progress. While the original deadline was two months, the Baojia units in various locations have been enthusiastically submitting their collected donations and receipt books. Details of this have been repeatedly recorded in various newspapers. The Aircraft Commemoration Association has successively received 25 yuan from Zhang Songqing of Jiangwan District, 30 yuan from Yu Hongfei, 29 yuan and 50 cents from Zhang Xietang of Pusong District, 56 yuan and 68 cents from Zhang Xuejun of Yinxiang District, 36 yuan from Tan Maokun of Song Park Road, 52 yuan from Zhou Juting of Yinhang District, 50 yuan and 50 cents from Xu Fusheng of McTyeire Road, 23 yuan from Wang Youwen of Jiangwan District, 13 yuan from Gao Yuanyue of Tangqiao District, 15 yuan from Shen Qishan of Zhabei District, 45 yuan from Qu Jingxian, 52 yuan from Shen Guanlin, 36 yuan and 10 cents from Chen Zhongyuan, 31 yuan from Zhong Donggen, and 51 yuan and 50 cents from Xu Yuqun of the 27th Bao, along with one copy of the triplicate receipt book each.

<h3>The London Financial Times Praises the China Development Finance Corporation</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch reports that the London Financial Times, a highly respected newspaper whose commentary carries considerable weight and is highly regarded by Europeans, recently published an article commenting on the China Development Finance Corporation. The Shanghai Times reprinted the article. The gist of the translation is as follows:</p>
<p>Since the Chinese government reformed the monetary system and stabilized exchange rates last winter, the benefits derived from this great measure are immeasurable. The recent report published by the China Development Finance Corporation is sufficient to show that the Chinese people have regained their faith in investment, and the restoration of this faith is sufficient to prove that the prospects for commerce are becoming increasingly profitable. The company was founded in 1934 with a capital of ten million yuan, raised by Chinese commercial banks and industrialists. Its purpose is to invest Chinese capital in various important enterprises, the most notable of which are railways and public utilities, which have traditionally been monopolized by foreign capital. Foreigners view this plan as an increase in the Chinese interest in investment, which is sufficient to make their bonds more stable, so there is absolutely no unwelcome psychology involved. The company's cooperation with the Sino-British Bank in June of this year to raise 1.1 million pounds for the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway loan is clear evidence of this. In addition to railways, the company's investments in public utilities include water and electricity plants, wired and wireless telegraphs, etc. Recently, as the people's confidence in the monetary system has grown stronger, in addition to lending to local governments, it has also moved to issue corporate bonds to engage in long-term lending to promote the development of industry. This is sufficient to balance the various loans and advances listed in the table, which have already increased by more than 95 million yuan, and the net profit for the previous half-year reached as much as 1.23 million yuan. Although China has various difficulties with foreign debt credit, it has made every effort to recover as a result of its recent active efforts, such as the attempt to clear the Kowloon-Canton Railway loan, which is recognized by British holders of Chinese bonds. As for the continuing development of China's internal situation as reported by the company, it is a reliable symbol of the increasingly consolidated Chinese commercial institutions.</p>
<h3>Three French Warships Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The fleet commander arrived from Qingdao aboard the Japanese warship "Yubari," which left Shanghai again yesterday. According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, warships from various countries have been arriving in Shanghai one after another. Yesterday, three more French warships arrived in Shanghai successively. One was the flagship "Lamotte-Picquet," aboard which Admiral Estéva, commander of the French Far East Fleet, personally arrived from Qingdao at 12:35 PM and docked at buoys 13 and 14 on the Yangshupu River. Another was the gunboat "Tahure," which entered the port at 12:40 PM and docked on the river surface of the Shanghai Naval Barracks Qiuxin Shipyard. The third was the cruiser "Admiral Roze," which entered the port at 2:00 PM in the afternoon and docked at the French Navy buoys on the Bund in the French Concession. Furthermore, the Japanese cruiser "Yubari," which had sailed to Shanghai from southern China the day before yesterday, left Shanghai again at 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices in Shanghai Rose Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Dagu News Agency, rice prices in Shanghai had previously soared due to the seriousness of the situation. Afterwards, as the situation eased slightly and people's hearts gradually settled, rice prices had uniformly fallen back. Yesterday morning, the weather was overcast and mild, and the future of the situation suddenly became tense. At the morning market, the price per dan at both the northern and southern rice industry wharves rose by three to four jiao, rising sharply, the same as the market price on the fourth. It had not fallen back by the time the market closed in the afternoon. According to observations from the rice industry, if the situation does not improve, rice prices are bound to continue to rise.</p>

<h3>Deadline for Industrial and Commercial Loans Approaching; Various Banks and Firms Are Accommodating; Loan Extensions Already Granted by Three Banks and Money Shops; Unpaid Interest to Be Recovered from Hengxing and Henglai Money Shops</h3>
<p>The end of October deadline for long-term industrial and commercial credit loans in Shanghai is fast approaching. The factories, companies, and shops that have taken out these loans have begun to contact the various banks and money shops to negotiate extension procedures. The Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank are allowing extensions for loans to the various money shops and are recovering unpaid interest from the two money shops. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Handling of End-of-October Procedures by Banks and Money Shops</h3>
<p>The total amount of long-term credit loans borrowed by various companies, shops, and factories in Shanghai from banks and money shops with an end-of-October deadline is over 50 million yuan. Shanghai remittance money shops account for six-tenths of this amount, Ningbo and Hankou money shops account for three-tenths, and commercial banks account for one-tenth. Borrowers are now separately contacting the various banks and money shops to negotiate extension procedures. Banks and money shops will specially accommodate those with better credit and grant them extensions. At the same time, they will also provide new credit loans. It is widely expected that this year's end of October will be very different from previous years and can be safely passed. As for the money market's foreign exchange borrowing, yesterday it was eight points, which proves that the money supply is not tight.</p>
<h3>Loan Extensions Granted Again by Money Shops</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance previously established a Supervisory Committee to assist the money shops and allocated 25 million yuan in financial public bonds for borrowing from the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, the Central Bank, and the reserve of various commercial banks and money shops. The borrowing money shops have now returned the loans one after another. Only a few money shops, such as Hengxing and Henglai, still have over 10 million yuan outstanding, which has been repeatedly extended and has not yet been repaid. The Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank have agreed to extend the repayment period again. However, the amount borrowed by the Hengxing and Henglai money shops is over 5 million yuan, and their collateral is real estate. Because these two money shops have started handling accounts receivable this year, they have delayed paying the interest due. The Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank have now notified the Money Shop Supervisory Committee to recover the money from the two money shops.</p>
<h3>No Changes in Shanghai Yesterday; Japanese Military on High Alert at Huayuan Street End</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, since the incident involving Japanese sailors in Hongkou on the 23rd of last month, the situation in Shanghai, with the Japanese marines crossing into Zhabei and deploying defenses in Hongkou, has remained unchanged yesterday, as it was the day before. The surface is very peaceful. A Xin Sheng News Agency reporter patrolled the area as usual yesterday morning. Except for the Japanese military's defense positions at the Yongfeng Building on North Sichuan Road, No. 504 on Dixiwei Road, No. 400 and No. 83 on Miller Road, No. 699 on Feilun Road, and the Japanese Women's School on Ouyang Road, where Japanese armored vehicles, military trucks, and motorcycles are parked, and patrols are dispatched to various roads from time to time, there are still two Japanese sentry posts at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Qiujiang Road, the intersection of Shigaota Road and Sida Road, Dixiwei Road, and the intersection of Tiantong Road. There are five or six people at the bridgehead of Jiaxing Road, and there are no Japanese sentry posts in other places. As for the Japanese military at the open space behind Huayuan Garden on Jiangwan Road and the Tanawu Brewery, the number is still over 100 people. In the past few days, pedestrians could still pass by at will, but yesterday the security was very tight. When the reporter went there, passers-by dissuaded him, saying that someone had been arrested and interrogated by the Japanese military a few days ago.</p>
<h3>Tang Shaoyi Expresses Views on Sino-Japanese Diplomacy: Government Has Its Own Policies; National Unification; Optimistic About the Country's Future; Will Not Go to Nanking for Now, Will Travel South When It Gets Cold</h3>
<p>A Xin Sheng News Agency reporter interviewed Mr. Tang Shaoyi, a member of the Central Committee, at his new residence on Daxilu Road yesterday morning to ask for his views on Sino-Japanese diplomacy. Mr. Tang is a senior figure in China's diplomatic circles, and his views are expected to be of interest to the outside world. However, Mr. Tang did not want to express much and said that he was a guest here and had no intention of interfering in national affairs. Regarding Sino-Japanese diplomacy, the government has its own policies, and the people should trust the government and be the government's support. Mr. Tang continued to answer the reporter's questions, saying that the Guangdong-Guangxi problem has now been resolved one after another, the country is unified, and the country's future can be viewed with optimism. Mr. Xiao Focheng has now gone to Siam. He does not know when he will return to the country and go to Nanking because he has not had any correspondence with him recently. He also has not heard when Mr. Bai Jiansheng will go to Nanking. Now that President Chiang has returned to Nanking, he does not plan to meet him recently, but will remain in Shanghai for rest and recuperation and will travel south when the weather turns cold. He also learned that Dr. Wang Chonghui, a member of the Central Committee, and Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, had visited Tang in recent days to talk.</p>
<h3>Anhui Agricultural Warehouse Completed; Handling Agricultural Product Loans; Each Warehouse Specializes in Storing and Pledging Rice and Cereals; First Deciding to Receive Loan and Establish Overdraft Contract</h3>
<p>After the China Agricultural Loan Syndicate signed a 1 million yuan agricultural warehouse loan contract with the Anhui Provincial Department of Finance and Construction, the Provincial Agricultural Warehouse Management Office immediately constructed provincial warehouses in 24 designated counties, including Fengyang, and established county warehouses in each county. Now, the provincial and county warehouses have been completed by the end of September. The provincial and county warehouses have received loans from the syndicate's office and have begun to handle agricultural loans. It is currently stipulated that they specialize in storing and pledging rice and cereals. Because the province has a bumper harvest of rice and cereals this year, farmers are very enthusiastic about storing and pledging rice and cereals in the warehouses. After the warehouse first decides to receive the loan from the syndicate's office, it will establish an overdraft contract, stipulating 3,000 yuan for each warehouse. From the second time onwards, the loan will be received with the agricultural product storage certificate.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Police Department Orders All District Stations to Conduct a General Mobilization to Suppress Opium Smokers; Over 80 Opium Dens Busted in One Month; Expansion of Temporary Hospital to Be Realized Soon</h3>
<p>According to the Dagu News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Police Department has already started a general mobilization to suppress opium smokers in the city. Each district has busted over 80 opium dens and plans to expand the drug addiction treatment center to accommodate registered opium smokers as much as possible. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>General Mobilization Throughout the City</p>
<p>Since the conclusion of the citywide general inspection work for banning opium and drugs in the city, the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, in order to strictly enforce the city's prohibition policy, has specially ordered all its subordinate districts to transfer senior police officers from each district, together with investigators from the Fourth Section of the General Bureau, to implement a general mobilization, house-by-house, to suppress opium smokers, starting from October 1. They will also be stationed on various roads, and if they see anyone who looks like they are smoking opium or drugs, they will immediately stop them for questioning and send them to a nearby designated or special hospital for examination.</p>
<p>Various Districts Bust Opium Dens</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Department fears that some lawless elements within the concession are not only smoking opium with permits, but also privately setting up opium dens for others to smoke, which is a major obstacle to the promotion of the prohibition policy. Therefore, it has strictly ordered all districts to seriously investigate and suppress them. Currently, it is estimated that since September 10, over 80 cases of privately set up opium dens have been busted throughout the city. There have also been many cases of trafficking and smoking red pills, morphine, heroin, and other drugs, which have been transferred to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for punishment according to the law.</p>
<p>Accommodating Registered Opium Smokers</p>
<p>There are a total of over 30 designated or special drug addiction treatment hospitals. Those sent directly by the Shanghai Municipal Police Department for treatment and those sentenced by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and sent to the Longhua and Zhabei drug addiction treatment centers are all full, and it is impossible to accommodate any more. However, the Shanghai Municipal Police Department has received an unusually enthusiastic response from opium smokers applying for voluntary drug addiction treatment in recent days. They are sent for treatment in order of application, but it is still insufficient. Therefore, in order to help opium smokers get rid of their suffering as soon as possible, the bureau is negotiating with the city's Anti-Opium Committee and other related agencies to plan the expansion and establishment of temporary drug addiction treatment centers and to increase the number of special hospitals in order to accommodate opium smokers as much as possible. This plan should be implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Counties Near Shanghai Announce Martial Law</h3>
<p>According to the Dagu News Agency, since the Sino-Japanese problem has become serious, rumors have spread, causing anxiety among the people, and a general group of traitors has been used by others, secretly operating in the counties near Shanghai. In order to prevent local security, the Jiangsu Provincial Government specially ordered the county governments of Baoshan, Shanghai, Jiading, Songjiang, Taicang, and other counties to advise the people to remain calm. After receiving the order, the Baoshan County Government, because the county faces the sea to the east, is an important transportation route, and is the throat of Shanghai, announced that it would step up preparations starting yesterday. The Public Security Bureau issued a martial law notice yesterday, stating that since the Chengdu incident occurred, similar unfortunate incidents have occurred in Shanghai, Guangdong, and Hankou. At this time, when the Central Government is trying to adjust Sino-Japanese relations, unscrupulous people and reactionaries may take the opportunity to incite, creating excuses for diplomacy. They have repeatedly received telegrams from the county government ordering them to pay close attention to prevention and to inform the people to understand the overall situation. They have ordered their subordinates to comply. However, this county is close to Shanghai, with convenient transportation, and there may be traitors coming to carry out activities, intending to cause incidents, disrupt order, and affect the overall situation. Therefore, starting today, they will, together with the security team, patrol in shifts and lock the city gates after 10:00 PM every night, prohibiting pedestrians from entering and exiting until 5:00 AM the next morning, when they will be opened. The doors of all shops and homes must also be careful to prevent accidents. If there are any unscrupulous people lurking and carrying out activities, they should immediately report to the bureau for investigation. They must all comply and not disobey. In addition, it is understood that other counties such as Shanghai, Jiading, Taicang, Fengxian, Jinshan, Chuansha, Nanhui, Qingpu, and Songjiang also announced temporary martial law starting today.</p>
<h3>Tobacco Leaf Industry; Opinions on Controlling Tobacco Leaves; Requesting Establishment of Curing Plant in Xuchang</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Shanghai Tobacco Leaf Industry Association previously stated that the government will implement tobacco leaf control, with official-merchant joint buying and selling agencies, which is related to the livelihood of the industry. It specially sent a letter to the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance stating the reasons and requesting the cancellation of the official-merchant joint buying and selling agency proposal. At the same time, it sent letters to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Ningbo Association in Shanghai to forward telegrams to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry appealing. Now, in addition to the Ministry of Industry's reply to the city's Chamber of Commerce, stating that they are aware of the telegram and have reported to the Ministry of Finance for verification, the Ministry of Finance has not yet issued a response. A reporter specially visited the industry association yesterday. According to the person in charge, the tobacco leaf industry advocates canceling the official-merchant joint buying and selling agency and devising other methods, that is, requesting the government to establish a curing plant in Xuchang. All Xuchang tobacco leaves must be cured and curing fees paid before they can be taxed and transported. Violators will be dealt with as privateers. The rest of the buying and selling will be left to the merchants' freedom. If this can be done, then the raw materials for private cigarettes will be eliminated without prohibition. The interests of national tax revenue and tobacco merchants will be considered at the same time. Moreover, the establishment of a curing plant with government power is easy to do and will have a significant effect. It is heard that the Tobacco Abandonment Industry Association will submit this method in the next few days for the Ministry of Finance to adopt.</p>

Then, Tao Baichuan, Pang Jingzhou, Zhu Xuefan, and others gave speeches. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Members Present</p>
<p>The autumn general meeting was held at the association's premises in the Hui Zhong Building on Avenue Edward VII at 5:00 PM yesterday. It was also the 40th general meeting since the association's establishment. Members present included Huang Ren Zhi, Jiang Wenyu, Wang Kui Sheng, Xiang Kang Yuan, Yang Weiyu, Zhu Xuefan, Shao Da Ren, Shen Zeng Kuan, Mu Ouchu, Xu Yang Nan, Wang Shao Xian, Pan Zhiwen, Hu Yunqiu, Hu Yunzhuang, Xu Ji Qing, Tao Baichuan, Liu Zhan En, Li Gongpu, Qin Runqing, Zhou Bangjun, Wang Boqi, Tao Leqin, Yu Yefeng, Zhu Jingan, Zhang Rongchu, Wang Zhihua, Xu Kecheng, Pan Xusheng, Liu Hong Sheng, Zhang Weiru, Ren Shigang, Pan Yangyao, Gu Xinyi, Yan Fang, Qian Xin Zhi, Du Yuesheng, Wu Yunqi, Li Zu, Lu Jing Shi, Lin Kanghou, Pang Jingzhou, Yu Zuoyan, Sun Hengfu, Xu Chao, Yang Zhixiong, He Dekui, Ren Musheng, Xu Caicheng, Chen Guangfu, Wang Xiaobo Hong, Feng Bingnan (representing Bo Hong), Jiang Yiping.</p>
<p>Chairman’s Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Du Yuesheng delivered the opening speech, saying, "Today is our autumn regular meeting this year, which is also the 40th general meeting since the establishment of our association. Fortunately, the national peace and unification have been roughly completed. Unfortunately, we are also facing an extremely serious Sino-Japanese negotiation. Shanghai is a transportation hub, and the smooth progress of the negotiation is closely related to Shanghai's industry, commerce, culture, and all undertakings, and even local peace and security. As citizens, we hope for the prosperity of local undertakings and the consolidation of public security, and at the same time, we deeply remember our national duties. We sincerely hope that our government will obtain satisfactory results in the negotiation without absolutely harming national sovereignty and rights. Although the recent negotiations between the two sides have not been hopeless, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita has clearly declared that 'the outcome of the negotiation will be either very good or very bad.' We have heard that our diplomatic authorities have also responded with a frank and sincere attitude based on reason. As human beings, we all have our personality. As a nation standing in the world, we also have our national dignity. This is what countries should respect themselves and each other. If there are people who disregard our national dignity and do not fight for it, whether they are the government or the people, they are disloyal to the country. The industry, commerce, culture, and all undertakings of today owe their existence to the support of national power. As the ancient saying goes, 'Without a country, where would the people be?' As we witness the unfolding of an extraordinary situation, we can only adhere to the spirit of not fearing difficulties, reaffirm our position as citizens of the Republic of China, assist our government, and rely on our own strength to sustain and renew our national life from a dangerous environment. We must not be driven by temporary emotions to act in an unconventional manner, nor should we be afraid of difficulties and seek temporary peace, thereby abandoning our great national duties. This association is formed by gathering leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai, and we are all willing to follow the national people to promote the righteous, honest, faithful, and courageous national characteristics of China, and work together to help our government stabilize this difficult national destiny. This is what everyone wants to say in their hearts, and although it does not need to be explicitly stated, it may as well be stated explicitly. On the occasion of this meeting, I sincerely express my views and hope for your understanding."</p>
<p>Work Summary</p>
<p>Then, Huang Ren Zhi, the general secretary of the association, reported on the autumn work of this year, saying, "(1) Current Affairs Research: In July, regarding the current situation, four telegrams were jointly sent with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the two public associations of silver and money and the shipping industry: (1) A telegram was sent to all members of the Central Committee, requesting them to go to the capital to participate in the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee; (2) A good telegram was sent, requesting the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee to quickly determine a major plan; (3) A telegram was sent supporting the important cases resolved by the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee and requesting Li and Bai to go to the capital.

(2) Recruitment of Specialized Talents: This work has been carried out since October 7, 1933, and has lasted for three years. Because the association does not have many staff members, it is carried out intermittently with the work of compiling statistics for Shanghai. For example, when compiling statistics, the investigation of specialized talents is temporarily suspended. Currently, 2,644 cards have been made. After the completion of this statistics compilation, this work will be continued. (3) National Goods Movement: This year, the Shanghai National Goods Movement Federation was jointly established with various national goods groups, divided into general affairs, domestic, and foreign groups, each with a work outline, which is gradually being implemented. The association is responsible for the general affairs office, which is attached to the association, and the work is very heavy. To name a few major tasks, such as inviting principals of schools at all levels to use the summer vacation to guide students returning to their hometowns to organize national goods propaganda groups, subsidizing middle schools in Shanghai to organize propaganda groups for Chinese goods during the summer vacation, going to the suburbs of Shanghai and Jiaxing and other places to give speeches, and also arranging with the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau to invite celebrities to host national goods broadcasts every week. Last month, a special home visit group was established, and five female interviewers were recruited and given short-term training. Starting from September 25, they took samples of national goods manufacturers every day and first carried out interview work in various residential areas. Another women's national goods clothing association is being formed and is currently recruiting members. (4) Rural Improvement: The work situation of the Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association is reported in a separate article. (5) Public Education: The work situation of the Zhabei Public Education Institute and the Minhang Guangci Institute are each reported in separate articles. (6) Shanghai Statistics: This compilation of supplementary materials, except for agriculture, which has not been supplemented due to the recent field survey, and administrative materials, which are not easy to collect, includes 14 categories: land, population, justice, finance, commerce, finance, industry, labor, transportation, public utilities, culture, education, society, and health. Each table is supplemented by at least two years. In terms of time, most of them are supplemented up to 1935, and the second largest is 1934. Some tables are supplemented up to 1936. Currently, 12 of the 14 categories have been completed, and only the two categories of culture and education have a small amount of materials that have not arrived. It is expected that all of them can be sent to print within a month.

<h3>Ministry of Railways Orders Two Railway Administrations to Strictly Prevent Smuggling</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate the transportation and sale of legitimate goods, the Beijing-Shanghai and Ningbo-Hangzhou-Shanghai Railway Administrations received an order from the Ministry of Railways on September 3, No. 3775, stating that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce had sent a telegram on behalf of the association, stating that at the sixth regular meeting of the Smuggling Inspection Committee of the association on the 21st of this month, the director of the inspection team proposed that since the government's vigorous anti-smuggling efforts, smuggling by sea vessels and railways had gradually disappeared, but smugglers were increasingly transporting smuggled goods to the interior by civilian boats, small steamers, tugboats, or long-distance buses to avoid inspection. The anti-smuggling agencies in various places have not yet paid attention to this. At present, due to anti-smuggling efforts, the transportation and sale of legitimate goods to various places are often hindered by inspectors, and they are detained for no reason, which hinders commerce. Please find a way to provide relief. It was agreed that this matter should be ordered by the Ministry of Railways to anti-smuggling agencies in various places to pay attention to civilian boats, small steamers, highway trucks, and prevent smuggling. At the same time, inspectors should be warned that they must facilitate the transportation and sale of legitimate goods and must not detain them arbitrarily. After discussion, it was decided to pass the proposal and telegraph the Ministry of Railways for review and implementation. The regulations on the inspection of imported goods and the transportation and sale of goods clearly stipulate the goods that should be inspected when loaded on ships, civilian boats, cars, and trains. The current inspection methods are very clear and should be earnestly implemented. Inspectors should also not arbitrarily detain the transportation and sale of legitimate goods, causing trouble. In addition to the distribution, the request should be reviewed and implemented in accordance with the instructions. This order is hereby issued to inform all departments.</p>
<h3>Sun Yufang, Employer Representative to the International Labour Conference, Arrives in Shanghai Today</h3>

<h3>The Municipal United Association of Special District One Announces to Citizens Undergoing Training That the Third Phase of Public Training Will Be Implemented Around Early December</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal United Association of Special District One announced yesterday to citizens who have registered for training that the association believes that civic training can temper the body, increase knowledge, and strengthen the concept of loving the nation and the country, which is the foundation for strengthening the country and the people, and should be universally accepted by our citizens. In the special zone, due to the obstruction of administrative power, it is more difficult for compatriots in the special zone to receive public training. Therefore, the association has concentrated registration and application for training. The list of citizens registered for training in the association has been submitted for record and approved by the Municipal Public Training Office. The third phase of training is expected to be implemented in early December. As soon as a definite date is set, a notice will be issued immediately. Fearing that people will be worried, this notice is hereby issued to inform everyone.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Asks Guangdong Province to Abolish Tobacco Monopoly and Implement Uniform Tax System</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that on the 5th of this month, the Guangdong Provincial Tobacco Industry Association sent a letter stating that since Chen's dictatorship in Guangdong Province, the implementation of the native tobacco monopoly has caused difficulties for merchants and farmers. The association has repeatedly reported this matter. On the 16th of this month, they suddenly received an announcement from Song, the Guangdong Finance Commissioner, and Wang, the director of the Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, stating that in order to relieve tobacco farmers and reorganize tax revenue, they decided to continue the native tobacco monopoly. They were shocked and confused. Lending loans to tobacco farmers is a common lending practice. Whether there is a monopoly or not, the government can lend money at any time. If the original interest rate is too high, it can also be ordered to restrict it and prohibit high interest rates. It is not necessary to implement a monopoly to relieve tobacco farmers. Regarding tax revenue, the Ministry of Finance has clear regulations that are universally implemented in all provinces. There are rules and regulations to follow, and it is not necessary to have a monopoly to reorganize tax revenue. Moreover, the native tobacco monopoly hides taxes in prices, which are the highest in the country. The higher the price, the slower the sales, the more storage, and the more smuggling. Restricting production will cause tobacco farmers to lose their jobs. Continuing the monopoly will cause tobacco merchants to go out of business. In recent months, the business sales have plummeted, and hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs. Their suffering can be seen. If the monopoly is maintained, the tobacco farmers will not be widely benefited, and the merchants who have been deprived of their livelihoods and gone bankrupt have been severely damaged. In this case, both tobacco farmers and tobacco merchants will suffer losses, and the government's tax revenue will not be helped. The advantages and disadvantages of this are clear. Moreover, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has spoken out against the implementation of monopolistic operations competing with the people for profit, and there have been announcements of the cancellation of harsh and miscellaneous taxes. This kind of native tobacco monopoly that harms the people has not been implemented throughout the country. How can Guangdong be treated especially harshly and used as a testing ground for the monopoly? Merchants and others are waiting to be relieved of their suffering and are exhausted. They dare to express their feelings and appeal again and again, hoping that the Ministry of Finance will uphold justice and quickly abolish the harsh monopoly policy, so that the merchants and farmers in the entire province will be grateful. The association checked and found that the Ministry of Finance had already changed the tobacco and alcohol monopoly system in various provinces to a fixed tax in order to unify the tax system and rectify tax revenue. However, Guangdong Province has its own customs, using the name of a monopoly and implementing heavy taxes. Before the province had accepted the delegation, although farmers and merchants were in difficulty, they could still claim that there was no way to appeal. If this kind of harmful policy is left after the unification of government orders and the elimination of annoying policies, it will inevitably make tobacco merchants lose hope and feel resentful. Native tobacco is not comparable to salt, and there is no need for a monopoly. All provinces implement the fixed tax method, and Guangdong Province should not continue to be different, so that the Ministry of Finance's facilities for unifying the tax system over the years will have a sense of unfinished business. It is appropriate to telegraph the Ministry of Finance for review and approval, and it would be convenient to handle the matter as requested by the association. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Tea Exports Decline This Year; Soviet Russia's Tea Planting Can Be Self-Sufficient; the Way to Recover Is to Improve the Manufacturing Method</h3>
<p>According to tea industry sources, the tea industry has been declining in recent years, and this year it is even more bleak. Foreign sales markets have been seized by Japanese tea, Ceylon tea, Siamese tea, and others. Soviet Russia was one of the largest sales markets for Chinese tea, but now it has also opened its own tea farms and is planting extensively, which can achieve self-sufficiency. However, according to the tea industry, Chinese tea has a unique color, aroma, and taste. If the manufacturing method and tea farms can be reformed, a portion of the foreign market may be recovered.</p>
<h3>Various Silk Factories Will Not Stop Production for the Time Being, but the Future of Silk Sales Is Still Bleak</h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that recently, the Shanghai silk market has seen firm silk prices due to the poor autumn cocoon harvest in the silk-producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, poor reeling, and estimates that the cocoon cost cannot be low. However, silk sales remain weak. Yesterday, the European and American silk markets remained calm, but the spot price in the Yokohama silk market opened at 755 yuan, an increase of 5 yuan compared to the previous day, and the forward price was 732 yuan, an increase of 3 yuan. The price of Shanghai Zhengji white filature silk in the Lyon silk market rose by 18 francs per kilo, opening at 84 francs, but there were no transactions due to price differences. Currently, there are still 41 silk factories in operation in the Hongkou, Zhabei, and Xinzha districts of Shanghai. The daily output is up to 30 dan of white filature silk. However, due to the stagnation of exports and domestic sales, the future of the silk industry is quite pessimistic. According to silk factory sources, although the output of various factories is very slow, they will not stop production for the time being because there are still many cocoons in storage.</p>
<h3>Heads of Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureaus in Haikou and Jiangmen Go to Guangdong</h3>
<p>Ma Lisan, the newly appointed head of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau in Haikou, and He Boxiang, the head of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau in Jiangmen, paid a visit to Chen Shuren, the chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, in Beijing to ask for instructions. They then came to Shanghai. It is now known that the two men took a French mail ship to Hong Kong and then to Guangdong on the 4th of this month to prepare for the establishment of the bureaus.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Asks the Ministry of Railways to Reduce Agricultural Product Transportation Charges to Recover Interests and Relieve the Rural Areas</h3>
<p>Jiangxi Province has had a bumper harvest of agricultural products this year. The Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural Product Transportation and Sales Agency seems to be dissatisfied with the freight rates on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. Therefore, it hopes that the Ministry of Railways will find a way to reduce the rates in order to recover interests and relieve the rural economy. According to the Jiangxi Provincial Transportation and Sales Agency in Shanghai, Jiangxi's agricultural product output is very high every year. Items such as miscellaneous grains, yarn cloth, and porcelain are quite large. The distribution of these products is centered on Shanghai. Before the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was opened to traffic, the transportation of these agricultural products out of the province was all by water, passing through Jiujiang and other places to Shanghai, which took eight or nine days. The Yangtze River ships are controlled by foreign ships, and the annual leakage of water feet is not small. Since the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, it has greatly increased the convenience of transporting goods from Jiangxi to Shanghai. However, because the railway freight charges seem to be more expensive than water transport, except for more expensive items such as cotton yarn and cloth, which are transported by rail, other miscellaneous grains and other items are still mostly transported by water. Jiangxi has had a bumper harvest of miscellaneous grains such as rice, wheat, and rapeseed this year. Transportation and sales will be even more enthusiastic. Therefore, it is hoped that the railway authorities will reduce the freight charges for agricultural products from Jiangxi on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, so that water transport can be changed to land transport, which can not only recover interests but also relieve the rural economy.</p>
<h3>Welcome Tao Baichuan</h3>

<h3>Parcels Sent to France Should Fill in Detailed Tax Declaration Lists</h3>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1356 states that according to Circular No. 9721269 of August 5 of this year from the International Postal Union, the French Post Office sent a letter stating that the French Customs had received complaints that the tax declaration lists (i.e., Form No. PC-3) attached to parcels sent from various countries were not detailed enough. The gross weight, net weight, and value of each item in the parcel were often not specified in the list. Sometimes the "What's Inside" column of the list was vaguely filled in with words such as "local products." As a result, when the customs authorities examined the contents and their weight, it was difficult to open all the parcels, which would easily cause delays. It was also found that some parcels were detained by the customs authorities because they did not have a certificate or import license, or because the permit was mistakenly sent to the initial receiving exchange office in the country without direct customs. This notice is hereby issued to inform everyone. Director Zha Peilin, October 5.</p>
<h3>Airmail to France Reached Paris the Day Before Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Counterfeit Currency Den Case Cracked</h3>
<p>The Shanghai French Concession Police Department recently cracked a counterfeit currency case. They found that Chen Xinchang, a shareholder and boss of the printing press, Yu Kunshan and Liu Zhongde, were printing workers, and Xiao Weibin and Zhu Lixing were specifically responsible for printing counterfeit currency. The Fan Shushan couple and Li Wangshi had no connection with the case. Yesterday morning, the criminals were escorted to the Second Special District Court. Wang Gangxu, the criminal court president, presided over the hearing in the first criminal court. Gu Shouxi, the legal representative of the police department, stated the investigation of the case and prosecuted Chen Xinchang, Yu Zushan, Liu Zhongde, Xiao Weibin, and Zhu Lixing on the charge of counterfeiting currency. Fan Shushan, Fan Wangshi, and Li Wangshi were not prosecuted due to lack of evidence.</p>
<h3>Guanghua Company Reduces Total Capital</h3>

<h3>Customs Provides 900 Yuan in Compensation; Maritime Court Determines Shooting Was Due to Circumstances</h3>
<p>Datong News Agency reports: On January 13th of this year, the No. 25 "Xunxing" patrol ship of the Shanghai Customs sank the "Jin Wanli" fishing boat in the Zhushanmen waters of Zhejiang, killing fisherman Lou Ahe. Afterwards, the deceased's family repeatedly appealed to the Ningbo Tongxiang Association for negotiations. Subsequently, the Customs convened a temporary maritime court to investigate the truth of the case. At that time, the judgment concluded that the Xunxing patrol ship had repeatedly ordered the fishing boat to stop, but the Jin Wanli refused to obey. Therefore, the Xunxing patrol ship's warning shot was indeed compelled by the circumstances and found no fault. However, 900 yuan was granted as a compassionate allowance to the deceased to show sympathy. After the Customs reported the above judgment to the Customs Department of the Ministry of Finance, it was learned yesterday that the Customs Department had already issued the compensation to the deceased's widow, Lou Xu, who received it with a guarantee. The case has now come to an end.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Bureau Supplies Bidding; Successful Bidders Sign Contracts</h3>
<p>Since its reorganization, the state-run China Merchants Bureau has strictly adopted open bidding procedures for all purchases by relevant departments as much as possible. Ordinary products have a large annual expenditure. As per usual ordinary practice, the general affairs department is responsible for purchasing them. This is not only frequent, but the procedures are extremely complicated, and even if the handling is meticulous, it cannot demonstrate great impartiality. Therefore, it was decided to reform this habit and publicly invite bids for the required ordinary goods, categorized by type. Bids were opened in public on the 22nd of last month, and senior officials designated by the Bureau reviewed the bids. For printing, the lowest bid was 83% by Daya Jiwu Institute. For tea, the lowest price was offered by Run Chang Tea House. For other supplies, such as toilet paper and matches, the lowest price was offered by De Tai Hao. All were selected as successful bidders, and the Bureau immediately notified them to complete the contract signing procedures. For stationery, only China Bookstore submitted a bid, with a bid price of 15%. It is heard that the China Merchants Bureau considers this bid price to be quite appropriate, so it has decided to negotiate the lowest price with China Bookstore based on this bid price and have China Bookstore handle all stationery supplies. The bids for soap, towels, batteries, etc., were found to be slightly higher than the wholesale prices of the original manufacturers, so the Bureau did not adopt them and decided to contact the manufacturers directly for purchases. According to the person in charge of the Bureau, this decision to openly bid for ordinary supplies will save approximately 15% to 20%.</p>
<h3>Deputy Section Chief of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, Wang Qiguang, Framed; Someone Sends Letter Implicating Him in the Xuansheng Case; Released After Investigation</h3>
<p>Wang Qiguang, deputy section chief of the Xihu section of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau, was suddenly taken to the court by a prosecutor from the Shanghai Local Court, accompanied by inspectors and bailiffs from the Public Security Bureau, at 9 PM the day before yesterday. The court session lasted until 11 PM when Wang was released. The reason was the assassination of Japanese businessman Xuansheng. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau cracked the case and arrested the suspects Wang Zhensheng, Mao Yonghu, Jin Daohong, Zhao Yunhong, and the women Wang Zai and Zhang Mo. After confirming their confessions, they were transferred to the local court and detained separately. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday, a letter was delivered to the detention center, addressed to one of the detainees in the case. The letter said that arrangements had been made and asked for pocket money to be collected from the section chief at No. 50 Pu Bai Fang, Luban Road in the French Concession. After inspecting the letter, the detention center deemed the matter extremely important and reported it to the chief prosecutor. The chief prosecutor also considered it a major matter and immediately sent a prosecutor to the French Concession police station along with inspectors from the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to search No. 50 Pu Bai Fang. They found nothing. After inquiry, it was learned that the address was the private residence of Wang Qiguang, deputy section chief of the Xihu section. They then rushed to the Railway Bureau and arrested Wang. The detainees were interrogated overnight, but none of them knew Wang. Therefore, the occurrence of this incident must be a prank by Wang Qiguang's enemy who saw the news report of this relatively important case and deliberately created this farcical drama. Otherwise, if it were a major criminal, how could he voluntarily throw himself into the net and send a letter to the court? Although they wanted to investigate the sender of the anonymous letter, there was no way to do so. Fortunately, Wang is a current civil servant, so he was immediately released. However, he and his family have suffered a great deal of shock.</p>
<h3>National Woodcut Exhibition Opens Yesterday; Over 500 Works on Display; Original Plates to Be Displayed Today</h3>
<p>The Second National Mobile Woodcut Exhibition, sponsored by Li Gongpu, Chen Heqin, He Jiahai, and others in the cultural circles of this city, opened yesterday on the ninth floor of the YMCA at Baxianqiao. Over five hundred exquisite works by more than forty famous woodcut artists from across the country, including Hu Qizao and Hong Ye, were displayed. Visitors flocked in an endless stream throughout the day. The exhibition is scheduled to last for three days and close at 6 PM on the 8th. It is also reported that yesterday, because some members of the public suspected that the exhibits were not all woodcuts, the association has decided to display the original woodcut plates starting today to clarify the matter for the audience and for them to learn from.</p>
<h3>Cattle Disease in This City; Dairy Cow Competition Postponed; Aim is to Improve Domestic Breeds; Cattle Breeding Ground in Chuansha</h3>
<p>The first dairy cow competition organized by the Livestock Improvement Promotion Association of this city was originally scheduled to be held on the 4th of this month, but has now been postponed due to a new disease recently affecting dairy cows in the city's dairies. A reporter from Datong News Agency inquired with the Association about the situation, as follows:</p>
<p>Reason for Postponement: Since initiating the first dairy cow competition in Shanghai, the Association has received assistance from Cai Wuji, Director of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, and Wang Zhaoyi, Chief of the Animal Inspection Section of the Municipal Health Bureau, and preparations have proceeded smoothly. Registration for both domestic and foreign dairy cows participating in the competition has reached one hundred heads. However, recently, some cattle in Shanghai dairies have developed a disease. Although whether it is contagious is still under investigation, the Association has temporarily decided to postpone the event for the sake of caution and to prevent transmission.</p>
<p>Purpose of Competition: The purpose of the dairy cow competition initiated by the Association is to improve the breeds of dairy cows in our country. Therefore, when the competition is held, dairy cattle breeders and farmers from all over the country will be invited to Shanghai to visit. At the same time, it is planned to establish a dairy cattle breeding ground in Chuansha County to improve the local dairy cattle breeds, so that the milk production and milk quality of domestic dairy cows can be improved at an accelerated rate. In this era, when milk has been recognized by the public as the main nutrient, preventing the leakage of nutrients is undoubtedly important.</p>
<h3>First Anniversary of Ge Gongzhen's Death; Bronze Statue Unveiled</h3>
<p>The famous reporter Ge Gongzhen passed away on October 22nd last year after traveling extensively in European countries and returning to Shanghai less than two weeks earlier after an unsuccessful surgery for appendicitis.

A memorial method was discussed the night before last. The bronze statue is a half-length, three feet high, and full of spirit and grandeur. It was donated by Jiang Xiaojian and will soon be placed on Ge's tomb in the First Public Cemetery in the city center to leave a permanent memorial.</p>
<h3>National Cartoon Exhibition Opens in Shanghai on Double Tenth Festival; Venue is the Ningbo Tongxiang Association</h3>

The association has now received more than five hundred cartoons and is generally ready for the exhibition. It is expected that the exhibition will make a fresh contribution at that time.</p>
<h3>National Day Approaching; National Party Flags Sell Well</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the General Bureau for the Production and Sale of National Party Flags has been quite effective in promoting the National Party Flag. Recently, it was learned that the sales branches and distributors in various provinces, due to the completion of national unification and the imminent National Day and the 50th birthday of Chairman Chiang, have all telegraphed the General Bureau for a large number of flags of various sizes, hoping to promote them widely before National Day. As a result, the General Bureau and the manufacturing plants are working day and night, and the work is very tense.</p>
<h3>Wang Yuhong Strangled in Liuying Road; Three Defendants Deny Murder; Wang Mounian Testifies Against Zhou Bingrong and Others</h3>
<p>Zhou Bingrong from Funing, Lv Qingfu (aka Lv Agen) from Yangzhou, Fan Dapeng from Funing, and Yang Jinbao, who is at large, had a long-standing feud with Wang Zhanian, a railway worker from Taizhou in the Guanyintang area of Huta Road. On the morning of July 25th of this year, they went together to the Wang family's door on Huta Road and kidnapped his seven-year-old son Yuhong to demand ransom. They demanded two hundred yuan from Wang but failed and were reported to the police. Therefore, in order to silence him, they strangled Yuhong with a rope on the lawn of a garden on Liuying Road. They found an old rush mat in a nearby empty house and used the original rope to tie up the body and took it to the Yikou River at Pengpu Temple. On the afternoon of the 29th of the same month, Wang Zhanian found the body. Because the body had been eaten by dogs, only five skeletal bones, two braids, and a belt remained. The local constable reported it to the local court for examination, and the Public Security Bureau arrested Zhou, Lv, and Fan and sent them to the court. After investigation by Prosecutor Zhao Chuanjia, they were indicted on charges of Article 347, Paragraph 1, Article 348, Paragraph 1, and Article 247, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Chen Kangsun held a trial. Wang Zhanian testified that the defendants did it. Zhou Bingrong argued, "I am in a feud with the plaintiff over money lending and have been falsely accused." Lv Qingfu testified, "I make a living delivering newspapers. When his child was lost, I was delivering newspapers and knew nothing about it." Fan Dapeng testified, "I am an opium smoker and don't get up early in the morning. I have really been falsely accused." At this point, the official ordered the case to be investigated and interrogated further.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Currency Organization on Wangzhi Road; Municipal Public Security Bureau Requests Transfer of All Suspects; French Police Do Not Prosecute All; Municipal Public Security Bureau Expresses Dissent</h3>
<p>On the 24th of last month, detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested counterfeit money offender Zhu Jinchang at the Yanhai Teahouse outside the Old North Gate and found a model of a Central Bank one-yuan note in his possession. Zhu confessed the location of the manufacturing facility at No. 12 Dunren Lane, Wangzhi Road in the French Concession. Detectives, accompanied by Zhu, requested assistance from the French police. The police chief dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to No. 11 Jiaoren Lane, Wangzhi Road, and broke up the counterfeiting organization. They arrested Chen Xinchang, Yu Kunshan, Liu Zhongde, Xiao Weibin, Zhu Lixing, Fan Shushan, Fan Wang, Li Wang, and others. They seized printing machines and a large number of printed notes. Wang Peiting, the second squad leader of the detective team representing the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, reported to the presiding judge, requesting attention to the process of solving the case. The French police did not know about the counterfeit money organization at No. 12 Dunren Lane, Wangzhi Road, beforehand. The Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested the counterfeiters Zhu Jinchang on the 24th of last month, and he confessed that the manufacturing facility was at No. 12 Jiaoren Lane, Wangzhi Road, and said that everyone in the facility was involved and that there were no outsiders. According to the confession of the arrested suspect, the Bureau requested the assistance of the French police to arrest and search, and arrested the eight defendants in the case and sent detectives to guard the facility. The next day, Zhang Kezhai and Zhang Liu, a husband and wife, were arrested again. Now the French police have only interrogated the eight defendants in the case and have not addressed how to deal with Zhang Kezhai and his wife. According to customary practice, the police should transfer the arrested defendants to the case for assistance. In this case, the police not only opposed the transfer, but released Zhang Kezhai and Zhang Liu, who were subsequently arrested. The tipster reported that Zhang Kezhai was also a boss of the organization and that Zhang Liu was also significantly related. After the case occurred, the Bureau父(Note: Probably should be 父, not 父) arrested two suspects in the Public Concession who manufactured copper molds and transferred them to the Public Police. Wait for the court to allow Chen Xinchang and other eight people and Zhang Kezhai and Zhang Liu, who were not released by the French police, to be transferred to the Bureau for joint interrogation. If the French police deliberately object, it will be difficult for the Bureau to handle the case. The presiding judge should approve the transfer of the defendants in this case to the Bureau for joint interrogation according to law, because the defendants in this case have committed serious crimes, and counterfeiting national bank notes is more important than any other case. At this point, Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated that the crime location of the defendant Chen Xinchang and others was within the Concession, the judicial organ is the court, the court is the Chinese court, the law adopted by the court is also Chinese law, the Police Department also advocates strict handling of the defendants who counterfeited universal currency, and the police prosecuted Chen Xinchang and other five defendants according to law, which is not inappropriate. As for Zhang Kezhai and Zhang Liu, who were released by the police, they were ordered to be released on bail because no evidence of a crime was found. If the court wants to interrogate them, they can also be summoned. After verifying the statements on the court, after questioning the defendants one by one, it was announced that the hearing would be rescheduled to the morning of the 13th, and the defendants would be remanded in custody, and the officials from the Public Security Bureau were told to submit official documents to the case for verification.</p>
<h3>National Products Promotion Association to Be Established This Month; Housewives Join the Initiation; Expedition Team Departure Date Undecided</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Movement Federation, in order to promote the use of national products by women, previously initiated the Shanghai Women's National Products Promotion Association, which was originally scheduled to be established last month, but was postponed due to incomplete procedures. In order to establish the association as soon as possible, it took advantage of the opportunity of national products women's visitors to visit everywhere, and at the same time solicited housewives to join the initiation. As of yesterday, more than 200 people had joined. According to Mr. Pan Yangyao, a member of the association, told a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency that the National Products Promotion Association has decided to formally establish within this month. As for the Yangtze River Expedition Team, because there is still one vacancy for the team members and it is difficult to find suitable candidates (currently only Lin Kecong and Huang Bingpei), the departure date has not yet been decided. Once suitable talents are found, they will depart to conduct inspections in Sichuan, Jiangxi, Anhui and other places.</p>
<h3>Shocking Rumors Spread; Carefree Old Man; Seventy-Seven Years Old, Traveling Around the World Seventeen Times</h3>
<p>Mr. Blightle Bank, an American, is seventy-seven years old. He used to be a businessman. At the age of fifty, he bought government bonds with all his life savings and no longer engaged in business, traveling at will for his own enjoyment, because he had loved traveling since he was a child. His only son is now running a real estate business in New York, so Mr. White is completely free and carefree. He can leave whenever he wants. In the past twenty years, he has traveled around the world sixteen times, covering a journey of one million miles. Fifty years ago, he first decided to come to China, and now he is making his seventeenth round-the-world trip and arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. Mr. White prepares $3,000 in travel expenses each time he travels. When the funds are about to run out, he plans to return. His itinerary is uncertain, like idle clouds out of the mountains, going wherever he likes. He does not stay long in each place, enjoying the scenery, watching dramas, or attending art exhibitions. When he is tired, he packs his bags and goes elsewhere. Mr. White does not like to travel by plane, not because he is old, but because he believes that traveling should be leisurely and comfortable, and rushing is uninteresting. Mr. White always likes to go and witness it when a country is about to have major events. He still remembers being in Washington when the American Civil War ended, and being in Russia during the Russo-Japanese War, watching the Russian fleet sail out and being defeated by the Japanese. In 1911, he first saw the Chinese Revolution, the Balkan War, and left the country just before the border was blockaded. When the European War broke out, he happened to be in Germany. There are too many other things to mention. Although Mr. White's spirit is good, he admits that his ambition is not as good as in the past, and he does not want to go to places with many troubles, so after he arrived in Shanghai, the tense situation between China and Japan eased slightly, which Mr. White found very enjoyable. Mr. White once said that among the countries he has visited, the most impressive is China, and the changes in China in recent years are indeed amazing. If his physical strength permits in the future, he will continue to travel frequently to enjoy his old age. Mr. White left Shanghai yesterday for Hong Kong and will go to Manila and other places. Eventually, he will also visit Jerusalem and then return home via Europe.</p>

<h3>First Special Court Continues Hearing of the American-Chinese Bank Lawsuit; Many Responsible Persons Evade Appearance; Liquidator Reports Confusing Accounts</h3>
<p>Shareholders of the failed American-Chinese Bank, such as Gu Yubo, and the initiators of the Daxin Bank, the predecessor of the American-Chinese Bank, such as Shen Jingzhong, were sued by more than a dozen creditors of the American-Chinese Bank, such as Wang Tingfang, to the First Special District Court for fraud and embezzlement. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng continued to hold a joint hearing. The defendants, including Sun Wenkui and Wang Zhonglin, reported to the court with their defense lawyer Lin Yingqing. The remaining defendants, Chen Yizai and Bao Zimin, were still represented by lawyer Jiang Yiping, who stated that Chen and Bao were in other places and could not rush to arrive. Zhang Xusheng was represented by lawyer Qian Zheng, who said that Zhang was still ill and could not report to the court. In addition, the defendant Jiang Baili has been sent abroad for inspection, Lin Kanghou went to Wuxi for business, and Qian Chengxu did not appear in court despite accepting the summons. Liu Tongfu's address is unknown, and Li Yitao and Shen Jingzhong have both fled. The plaintiff's lawyer Wu Peng and others requested that Li et al. be wanted, following the example of Zhao Yubo. Lawyer Wu also submitted a letter signed by Wang Peilin, stating that the letter stated that Sun Wenkui was indeed a shareholder of the American-Chinese Bank, and there was one other person who also knew that Sun was a shareholder of the bank, but that person could not come to court to testify today due to illness. The liquidator of the bank then reported on the investigation of the accounts, saying that the 3,000 yuan recorded on the accounts of Sun was a temporary deposit, and it was transferred from the Daxin Bank, but the account books of the Daxin Bank before April 7 were still missing. What was seen was the American-Chinese Bank's accounts from April 8, which recorded a total of 210,000 yuan deposited in Citibank and the Central Bank, but the investigation of the two banks showed that there were no deposits at all. Other items, such as 140,000 yuan in start-up fees, also did not list detailed accounts, so it was impossible to determine their authenticity. Stock account books were also not found, and it was unknown how much stock had been collected. When questioned, the defendant Sun Wenkui stated, "I served in the bank from January 15 of this year. At that time, it was named American-Chinese Bank and had already started business. The opening on April 8 was the suggestion of the board of directors. The accountant was Chen Weili, a confidant of Gu Yubo." Lawyer Jiang Yiping then defended Chen and Bao, saying that Chen and Bao were also victims of fraud. At this time, lawyer Ma Lewu represented the creditor Li Jingfang to the court, stating his participation in the lawsuit. After verification by Judge Huang, it was announced that the cases would be rescheduled for further hearing on the afternoon of the 19th of this month.</p>
<h3>Criminals Call for Improved Detention Conditions; Four Deaths in One Night; Two-Thirds Suffer from Illness; List Four Goals for Improvement</h3>
<p>Since Shanghai County cracked down on smoking, the Public Security Bureau's detention center has suddenly increased a large number of smoking offenders, but the detention center's equipment and management have not been expanded, so there are inevitable problems of crowding and inadequacy. From 5 to 6 PM on September 30, four people died of illness in a row. Among the smoking offenders in the detention center, those who are sick account for more than two-thirds. The authorities have not seen any preventive measures. Therefore, the detainees Wang Haimen, Tang Jinxiang, Gu Guanlin, and others, 64 smoking offenders in total, jointly submitted a petition to the county party department, requesting relief, and listed the points that should be improved, such as (1) moldy rice and many people are poisoned, (2) unboiled drinking water leads to bloating, (3) too little "release" time and no opportunity for walking and exercise, (4) those with diseases are not isolated, and the spread of infection is increasing. In the petition, it says that the people have occasionally violated the law, but the case is not theft, and it does not seem that they should be subjected to such abuse. At the 159th meeting of the county party department yesterday, it was considered that the petition was true and decided to send a letter to the county government to order the Public Security Bureau to earnestly improve it to prevent recurrence.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the second day of the pre-exhibition of Xiong's Three Talents' works before going abroad. In the early morning, famous German figures, both men and women, visited together and purchased five or six excellent works, which they will take back to Europe by ship this morning.

<h3>Widow Sues Father-in-Law - Abandonment and Encroachment Case - Judge Urges Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Zhou Zuohong, a native of Chaozhou, runs Zhenfeng and other pawnshops at 19 Taopeng Road and other locations. His son, Zhou Huiqi, after graduating from Fudan University, went to teach at the Chinese School in Mahua, Nanyang. He returned to Shanghai in a certain year and married Weng Wenying, the daughter of the owner of Shengxing Pawnshop at 8 Maohai Road (a graduate of the Patriotic Girls' School, currently studying medicine at Tongde Medical College). However, less than eight months after the marriage, Zhou Huiqi died of illness. When Zhou died, Weng Wenying was pregnant and subsequently gave birth to a daughter. Recently, Weng Wenying sued Zhou Huiyi in the Special First Court for encroachment, alleging that her husband had remitted 1,300 yuan to his brother, Zhou Huiyi, before his death, but Zhou Huiyi refused to hand it over. The details of the trial have been reported in this newspaper. Now, Weng Wenying, represented by lawyer Qiu Hanping, filed a lawsuit against her father-in-law, Zhou Zuohong, in the Special First Court for abandonment and encroachment, alleging that Zhou Zuohong stopped paying living expenses after her husband's death, and that 1,000 yuan remitted by her husband from Mahua during his lifetime was deposited with Zhou Zuohong at his Zhenchang Pawnshop, but has not been returned. She requested that he be punished according to Articles 294 and 335 of the Criminal Code and also filed a civil lawsuit, demanding repayment of the deposit of 1,000 yuan and interest at the statutory rate of 5% per annum from July 1 of the year 19 until the date of execution, and ordering the payment of alimony of 12,000 yuan, as well as a deposit of 9,000 yuan for education funds, with the principal and interest to be used for the education expenses of the young daughter. Yesterday afternoon, this case was heard in the Criminal Division Eight by Judge Chuan Lin. According to Weng Wenying's testimony, after her husband's death, the defendant's family regarded her as an unlucky person. Because the child she gave birth to was a girl, the defendant held a patriarchal attitude and treated her extremely cruelly. As a result, she attempted suicide once and returned to her mother's home, while continuing her studies at Tongde Medical College in order to support herself in the future. However, since her husband's death, the defendant has not provided any living expenses, so she filed the lawsuit. Questioning Zhou Zuohong, he testified that he had not neglected the plaintiff's life, and had rented a front building next door to the Di family at a monthly rent of 18 yuan, which has not yet been returned, and that he also paid 200-300 yuan a year for the plaintiff's education expenses, but the plaintiff demanded 960 yuan, which he could not afford. He also retained lawyers Zou Yu and Chen Changsheng to defend him. Judge Chuan believed that this case was a family dispute, and that the amount in dispute was not significant, so reconciliation was the best way to avoid litigation. He adjourned the hearing and ordered the parties to attempt reconciliation outside the court.</p>
<h3>Ningxing Discussion - Young Man Jumps into the Sea and Commits Suicide - Leaping into the River at Zhanghuabang - Deceased Ye Zhixing Left a Suicide Note</h3>
<p>The Ningxing Wheel, operated by Sanbei Company on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, departed from Shanghai for Ningbo on the 3rd. Before it had left the Wusongkou, a passenger jumped into the sea and committed suicide. The following are the details explored by a reporter from Datong News Agency:</p>
<p>Jumping into the River to Commit Suicide</p>
<p>The Ningxing Wheel departed from Shanghai at 5 p.m. on the date. At about 7 p.m. that evening, while passing through Zhanghuabang (before leaving the Wusongkou), a young (approximately 20 years old) passenger on the upper bunk of the ship jumped into the sea and committed suicide. The tea attendant Dai A Yao, who was responsible for entertaining the passengers, immediately reported to the shipowner, who stopped the ship to salvage the body. However, it had already been submerged by the tide and could not be recovered. The ship then continued its voyage to Ningbo.</p>
<p>Suicide Note Recovered</p>
<p>Afterwards, tea attendant Dai A Yao recovered a felt hat, a long gown, and a suicide note from the passenger's berth. The suicide note was written in blue ink and was addressed to the tea attendant. The words were as follows: "Brother A Yao, I came here to commit suicide. Please send my hat and long gown to Mr. Shi Hexuan of Quanquan Factory, 36 Lane, Tongzhou Road, Hongkou, No. 2. There are more than a few yuan in my pocket as a reward for your trouble. Whether you send it or not depends on your conscience." Signed "Ye Zhiyu." Presumably, this is the name of the deceased. After the ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday, the tea attendant delivered the suicide note and belongings to the address according to the instructions.</p>
<h3>Robbing Puxin Town - One Thief Arrested in Shanghai - Principal Arrives in Court to Testify - Sentenced to be Transferred to Qingpu for Trial</h3>
<p>At about 5 p.m. on August 23, Xin Town Township, Qingpu County, was attacked by a large number of Anhui bandits, more than 40 in number, each armed with long and short guns. They first emptied the township's defense post of weapons, and then began robbing shops of property worth more than 4,000 yuan, before shouting and boarding a boat to escape. The day before yesterday, Li Quanwu, the detective chief of the local water patrol team, received a tip that a member of the gang, Xu Mojian (age 58), from Anhui Province, was hiding at 30 Renchang Lane, Qiwupu Road, in the Public Concession. He came to Shanghai to report to the Yulin Road Police Station for assistance in the arrest. The detective chief dispatched detective Pan Yunlong to arrest him at the address, and brought him and his 17-year-old grandson, Xu Daoshi, to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu from the Public Works Bureau described the case and stated that the defense post and the robbed shops were present to identify them, and agreed to the transfer. Li Quanwu, the water patrol captain, submitted a public notice. Hu Zhangshu, a soldier from the defense post, from Anhui Province, stated that he heard gunfire at the time and saw a crowd of thirty or forty bandits. They tied him up with ropes and beat him, and the weapons were also taken away. The defendant Xu Mojian was one of them. Shen Shasan, the owner of the Xieshun distiller from Qingpu, testified that he was taken out of the workshop by several bandits, tied up on the bandit ship, and beaten. They also demanded 50 yuan for passage fees. The property in the distillery was robbed, and he had no money left. He begged his captors to release him. He witnessed Xu Mojian carrying a large bag of copper coins for the first time, and cigarettes and other items into the ship for the second time. He was not falsely accusing him. When questioned, Xu Mojian denied everything. Judge Zhong Qing ordered that Xu Mojian be handed over to Li Quanwu, an official from the Qingpu County Government, for removal. The grandson, Xu Daoshi, did not need to be transferred.</p>
<h3>Brother and Sister Argue over Smoking - Brother Commits Suicide by Taking Poison</h3>
<p>Wu Fuhui, a native of Ningbo, 36 years old, residing at 11 Quanyuli, Anaqin Road, in the French Concession, is a businessman. His son, Yue Lang, 19 years old, does nothing and hangs out with hooligans every day. At 10 a.m. on the 4th, Yue Lang was criticized by his sister, Lin Lang (21 years old), for consuming cigarettes and not producing anything, and for losing money every day on cigarettes. This led to a conflict and argument between the siblings. Later, Yue Lang went out and did not return. He committed suicide by purchasing raw opium and swallowing it. At 10 a.m. the next morning, he returned home. Because the poison took effect, he was extremely uncomfortable and his face turned pale. His mother, Wu Zhou, discovered this and sent him to Renji Hospital. However, he was too deeply poisoned to be saved and died at 1:40 p.m. The hospital reported to the French Police, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was sent to the Tongren Funeral Home for examination. Yesterday, a report was submitted to the Second Special Court. The chief prosecutor and forensic medical officer arrived and confirmed that the deceased had indeed died from poisoning before death. After questioning the deceased's mother and sister, they ordered the body to be handed over to the deceased's mother, Wu Zhou, for burial.</p>
<h3>Wang Ziming - Pretending to be a Deity and Killing People</h3>
<p>Wang Ziming, 40 years old, from Jiangyin, lives in a house in Zhoujiaqiao, West Shanghai. He pretends to be a deity and treats people for illness, swindling them out of their money. The day before yesterday, Shen Shixing, who lived in the same house, sought Wang's treatment for his young daughter's serious illness. Wang determined that the illness required the arrival of deities to be effective. Shen, who was anxious about his daughter, did not think twice and paid 18 yuan to ask Wang to invite the deities to treat her. However, the deities did not arrive yesterday morning, and A Ju died. Shen believed that Wang should not have delayed her life, and dragged Wang to the Caojiadu Public Security Branch. The branch prepared a document and sent it to the headquarters for handling.</p>
<h3>Young Child Suffers from Dysentery - Skin Ulcerates After Taking Medicine - Tang Liwen Sues Female Doctor Zhang Xiuyu - Experimented in Court Once and Injured</h3>
<p>Tang Liwen, from Zhenjiang, residing at 450, 391 Lane, Jiangjia Lane, Gordon Road, sought treatment at the Labor Hospital on Xiaoshadu Road for his two-year-old son, Da Shizi, who was suffering from dysentery. Female doctor Zhang Xiuyu of the hospital diagnosed him and gave him five packets of medicine powder and a bottle of sesame oil, instructing him to take the medicine powder in five doses and then swallow the sesame oil. However, after taking the medicine powder, the child immediately vomited it out. The skin and flesh where the vomit passed became ulcerated. After being sent to Baojiang Hospital, the diagnosis was that the medicine powder contained toxic substances. Tang retained a lawyer and filed a lawsuit in the Special First Court against Dr. Zhang for negligent injury. The Special Court had already heard the case once. Zhang Xiuyu stated that the medicine did not contain any toxic substances, and that the child also suffered from stomatitis, with sleeping symptoms already present in the mouth and many white spots on the lips. The court ordered that the diagnosis report from Lu Baojiang Hospital be reviewed later. Yesterday afternoon, this case was heard again in Criminal Division Eight by Judge Chuan Lin. The diagnosis report from Baojiang Hospital had also been submitted to the case file. The details stated in the report were entirely based on the statements of both parties. After being distributed to the lawyers of both parties for review, Judge Chuan applied the so-called toxic medicine powder presented by the plaintiff, mixed with sesame oil, to Tang Da Shizi's arm to see if there was indeed a possibility of ulceration. However, after a considerable amount of time, no such phenomenon was observed. Subsequently, a doctor named Sha arrived in court and testified about the diagnosis and treatment of Tang Da Shizi's stomatitis. The court then ordered the start of the debate. After the lawyers of both parties debated, Judge Fu announced the conclusion of the hearing and scheduled the judgment for 2 p.m. on the 8th.</p>
<h3>The Xingye Trust Company Sponsors the Opening of the Health Assurance Society</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She (New Sound News Agency), the Shanghai Health Assurance Society, sponsored by the Municipal Xingye Trust Company, is scheduled to open this morning. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Opening This Morning</p>
<p>The society has been in preparation for over four months. Its purpose is purely to enhance the health of citizens. Specialist doctors have been hired to provide free medical consultations to members. The opening is scheduled for this morning without any ceremony. In the afternoon, tours will be offered to various sectors. According to the person in charge of the society, speaking to a Xin Sheng She reporter yesterday, "A sound mind resides in a sound body. In this era of the survival of the fittest, if we wish for the survival of the entire nation, there is no alternative to self-strengthening. The first condition for self-strengthening is that every citizen must have a healthy body. Therefore, the national budgets of Japan and Soviet Russia both include huge allocations for national health policies. This shows that their path to becoming strong nations lies in their approach to national strength. The weakness of our nation is an undeniable fact. Although there has been considerable progress in recent years, compared to other strong nations, the progress is clearly insufficient. The reasons for this are, firstly, that health construction requires multi-faceted efforts that cannot be achieved in a short time, and secondly, that social and economic instability causes everyone to worry about food and clothing, which invisibly hinders the essential elements of national self-strengthening. The Shanghai Xingye Trust Company, in view of this, has specially established the Health Assurance Society in a municipal capacity. By charging the most economical and reasonable membership fees, it seeks citizen membership. Actively, it will contribute various forms of health knowledge to members, enabling them to know how to enter the path of health. Passively, it has specially hired various well-known specialist doctors to provide free diagnosis and treatment to members, restoring their lost health."</p>
<p>Overview of Society Affairs</p>
<p>(1) This society is established by the Shanghai Xingye Trust Company and will be managed with the spirit of the Xingye Trust Company in operating other social enterprises. (2) The society's membership is divided into two types: basic and special. The annual membership fee for basic members is three yuan, and for special members, it is ten yuan. Although there is a difference in fees, the society's services are provided by specialist doctors who provide conscientious diagnosis and guidance, without any discrimination. However, special members have a special waiting room and the right to advance their consultation time. (3) Group memberships (such as for institutions, schools, shops, factories, etc.) will receive the following discounts: 10% off the original membership fee for 10 or more people, 15% off for 50 or more people, 20% off for 100 or more people, and further negotiations are possible for 150 or more people. (4) For family memberships, each family member other than the head of the household will pay half of the head of household's membership fee. (5) Each of the society's major specialties is headed by highly experienced and reputable medical doctors. Their names and consultation hours are listed separately below. In addition to the specialist doctors who are on duty during designated hours, the society also has doctors on duty who provide continuous service during consultation hours. Consultation hours are from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM. The clinic is closed on Sundays and holidays. (6) The society is not only established for treating illnesses but will also plan to hold health trips, group check-ups, and other health campaigns from time to time, as well as publish materials that instill health knowledge to enhance the health and happiness of its members. (7) The society has special maternity insurance certificates. Each certificate costs a set fee and covers all costs, regardless of normal or difficult delivery, hospitalization, or injections. This novel approach solves the entire labor and delivery problem for pregnant women. The certificates are divided into three types: A, B, and C, which can be pre-ordered according to their economic situation. For detailed information, please contact the society.

<p>At the same time, maternity insurance measures have also been formulated for pregnant women to ensure the safety of childbirth. The original text states: (1) The society has special maternity reservation certificates, which are divided into the following three types: Type A maternity reservation certificate, 60 yuan in national currency; Type B maternity reservation certificate, 28 yuan in national currency; Type C maternity reservation certificate, 10 yuan in national currency. If a society member reserves maternity care, Type A will be reduced by 10 yuan and calculated as 50 yuan, and Type B will be reduced by 3 yuan and calculated as 25 yuan to show preferential treatment. However, Type C does not differentiate between members and non-members. (2) Type A and Type B maternity insurance must be purchased no later than the eighth month of pregnancy. (3) Type A maternity insurance enjoys the following benefits: 1. From the date of purchase of the insurance until delivery, you can come to the society for free examination and treatment at any time with the certificate. However, inviting the society's doctor for a house call must be handled in accordance with Article 15 of the society's member treatment guidelines. If a member requests a house call from the society's doctor, they must register with the society with their membership card during the prescribed hours. The fee for a specialist doctor is eight yuan in national currency, and the fee for a doctor on duty is four yuan in national currency. The fee for emergency visits is doubled. The consultation fee must be paid in full at the time of registration. Telephone registration is invalid. 2. During delivery, you can stay in the first-class ward of the hospital designated by the society.

Regardless of whether it is a normal or difficult delivery, the surgery fee and the materials, medicines, and baby food used during hospitalization are not charged separately. 4. Outpatient or house call visits for the mother and baby within six days after discharge are free of charge. However, the free hospitalization time is determined by the society's doctor. If you voluntarily extend your hospitalization time, all expenses during this period must be borne by yourself. (4) Type B maternity insurance allows you to stay in the third-class ward of the hospital designated by the society, and the rest is handled according to the Type A method. (5) Type C maternity insurance only covers normal delivery and does not provide hospitalization. The society will send a doctor to the pregnant woman's home to deliver the baby. All prenatal outpatient examinations, outpatient and house call visits within six days after delivery, and materials and medicines used during delivery are included and will not be charged separately. In the event of a difficult delivery, the surgery fee and hospitalization fee must be borne by yourself. (6) For Type A and Type B, if you voluntarily deliver at home, you must obtain the permission of the society's doctor, but the hospitalization fee will not be refunded. In the event of a difficult delivery, you must still be sent to the hospital, otherwise it will be considered a termination of the insurance midway.

<h3>Swiss Philanthropist Enthusiastically Assists with Donations</h3>
<p>Mrs. Nobel of Switzerland has always been enthusiastic about international charitable causes. Recently, she came to China with her husband for business and witnessed the large number of disaster victims in our country and the hardship of their lives. Her compassion arose spontaneously. Upon learning that the China International Famine Relief Commission at 505 Henan Road in this city is a well-known relief organization in our country, she personally visited to learn about the general situation of their work and expressed great sympathy. She immediately donated five yuan in national currency and expressed her willingness to undertake voluntary publicity. She then wrote an article about the disaster situation in our country and published it in the International Gazette and various newspapers in Geneva, widely soliciting donations to aid the relief effort. Many people were moved by her and generously donated to the cause. According to the person in charge of the Relief Commission, they have recently received many donations from Switzerland. Although the amounts are not large, the sincerity is very sincere. One donor, who signed as "Swiss Mother," sent one gold yuan and wrote in a letter that her financial resources were meager and she could not donate much money. Given the severity of the disaster situation in your country, she was doing her best to fulfill her responsibility of mutual assistance with her savings. Another donor, Ms. Doron, remitted a donation of eight shillings, stating that no receipt was needed to save on postage and to transfer the money to help the disaster victims. More recently, the Swiss Youth League collected donations from 30 people, totaling fifteen pounds and seven shillings, equivalent to 256.52 yuan in national currency, and remitted it to Mrs. Nobel for transmission to the Commission. The kindness of foreign philanthropists is truly touching.</p>
<h3>The China Health Association, Which Promotes Health Insurance, Will Have a Joint Service Organization with Physicians and Hospitals Throughout the City.</h3>
<p>Healthcare, or rather sickness insurance, has been practiced in various countries for a long time, with significant results in improving national health. Our country has never had such an organization. In light of the current social situation, this type of organization is becoming increasingly necessary. There are two reasons for this: (1) Due to the decline of the social economy and the difficulty of general life, neither individuals nor families can afford the burden of medical expenses, and they feel the pain of being unable to seek medical treatment and hospitalization, which directly leads to the loss of individual happiness and indirectly affects the health of the entire nation. (2) Based on the above situation, doctors and hospitals generally feel it is difficult to maintain operations, which directly deals a major blow to the spirit of doctors and hospitals serving society, and indirectly affects the development of medicine in a country. Therefore, to solve this serious problem in today's society, the only way is to unite the people, doctors, and hospitals and establish a strong healthcare organization. On the one hand, we can pool the economic strength of the masses to seek medical protection for the masses and improve the health of the nation. On the other hand, we can pool the medical equipment of doctors and hospitals and increase opportunities for joint service to the masses. This can not only solve the problems of doctors and hospitals themselves but also promote various medical and health construction projects in society and consolidate the foundation for the development of medicine. It is reported that the China Health Association, initiated by the Hongqiao Sanitarium and organized with joint service from physicians and hospitals throughout the city, is currently actively underway and will be established soon.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of Foreigners' Love for National Products</h3>
<p>— Yan Maode</p>
<p>It has been more than ten years since the promotion of national products began, but the effectiveness achieved is still very small. Generally speaking, urban modern men and women, from head to toe, the things they need are all fascinated by foreign goods, taking the purchase of foreign goods as extravagance, and becoming good customers of foreign goods. This invisible poison, as Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "This is even more powerful than using millions of soldiers to kill us."</p>
<p>Let us observe the people of various countries, their psychology of loving national products really makes us feel ashamed. For example, Japanese people, whether at home or abroad, are happy to use national products. Even small things such as chopsticks and thread are eager to buy domestic goods, so the people are rich and the country is strong.</p>
<p>German parents often teach their children, "Use German pens, German ink, and German paper, and do not take even a little bit from foreign goods to prevent our country's (Germany's) money from flowing abroad." This is specially written here, hoping that the modern men and women who are addicted to foreign goods will also be enlightened and wake up.</p>
<h3>Glory of the National Products Industry: Wuzhou Establishes a New Ten-Story Building</h3>
<p>— Yang Xinsheng</p>
<p>Recently, a ten-story building has been erected on the corner of Fuzhou Road and Henan Road in Shanghai. People passing by who suddenly see this building would initially think it is a large bank - or a grand building of a foreign company. Looking carefully at the writing on this building, they will realize that it is actually the new ten-story building built by Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Factory itself.</p>
<p>Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Factory is the leader of the new pharmaceutical industry in our country and the vanguard of the national products industry in our country. It is now able to build its own ten-story building, a high-rise reaching the clouds. Such a magnificent scene is a glory for the national products industry in our country and a manifestation of the progress of the real industry in our country!</p>
<p>In the past, Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Factory and its affiliated factories created various household medicines and hygiene products... improving the health of the people and benefiting society. These achievements are very obvious. Especially the contributions to industry and national defense, such as the successful domestic glycerin, which is even more worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>As for the interior of the company's ten-story new building, it has been properly arranged. The two floors below are the business department, and the floors above are office rooms, famous doctors' clinics, and staff dormitories. In the middle of the third floor, there is also a memorial hall for Mr. Xiang Songmao, the former general manager of the company, designed by famous craftsmen from Peiping, solemn and magnificent, to commemorate Mr. Songmao's martyrdom.</p>
<p>This year's Double Ten Festival, the company's new building will hold a completion ceremony and the unveiling ceremony of the Xiang Memorial Hall, and at the same time hold a 30th anniversary celebration, inviting people from all walks of life to visit, and especially invite Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang to give a speech. The achievement of this great undertaking is bound to have an unprecedented and enthusiastic celebration at that time!</p>

<p>Word of Contribution</p>
<h3>Economic Strength and Vitality</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Xiaolai recently stated at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's National Products Exhibition: "Using foreign goods destroys the nation's economic strength and extinguishes the nation's vitality." In other words, to increase the nation's economic strength and expand the nation's vitality, only promoting domestic goods can achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Let us think about it. For the past fifty years, China has been trading with foreign countries, with annual trade deficits amounting to tens of millions of yuan. This is like sucking marrow and extracting essence. The outflow of silver each year is countless, leading to an empty national treasury and withered livelihoods. The nation's economic strength has become extremely weak, and the nation's vitality has become even more stagnant. Day after day, the lamp runs out of oil, creating an unprecedented national crisis, giving those who seek to harm us ample power and handing them a weapon, which is equivalent to suicide. The failure of China's foreign trade and the habit of favoring foreign goods are extremely painful to speak of. We have often said that if the Chinese people do not awaken and extricate themselves, and only esteem foreign goods, in ten years at most, or five years at least, China will reach a point beyond repair. The nation's strength is depleted, and its vitality is exhausted. Such a nation and people, existing as if about to perish, what else is there to await but destruction?</p>
<p>The people of the nation should understand what kind of era this is. Knives are being sharpened, constantly seeking trouble, constantly thinking of how to destroy and humiliate us. If we remain unaware and only protect our personal lives and property, this is how a nation destined for destruction behaves, and it is not what should be expected of the Chinese people. We believe that the national crisis is so severe that a state of emergency has already begun. We, as citizens and various sectors of industry, commerce, and finance, must make earnest preparations in terms of both economic strength and vitality. How should we begin?</p>
<p>To increase economic strength, we should pay attention to three aspects: manpower, material resources, and financial resources. Manpower can be trained and learned. Financial resources should be fully prepared with currency to prevent capital from fleeing and the national treasury from becoming empty. In particular, the outflow of capital should be avoided. The preparation of material resources, adjusting consumption, reducing consumption, centralizing production, and improving production are all points that should be paid attention to at present. And the core should be promoting domestic goods and using domestic goods. This is a critical juncture for the people of the nation today, and we must not let it go.</p>
<p>To increase vitality, the expansion of vitality lies in the communication between urban and rural areas. We must transform the desolate and dying countryside into a vibrant and energetic place, and transform the falsely prosperous cities into places of substantial strength. This depends on the communication between manufactured goods and local products. We hope that the products of urban factories will find outlets in the interior, and the raw materials and local products produced in rural areas can be exported to adjust surpluses and deficits, so that the rural economy can become flexible and boost its purchasing power, and the nation's vitality will be cultivated as a result.</p>
<p>This is the preparation we should have in this state of emergency, and it is also the work we should do in the midst of a severe national crisis.</p>
<h3>Mr. Xu Guqing Who Sets an Example in Promoting National Goods</h3>
<p>— Preparing to be Successful</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Guqing, a member of the National Government, whose name was Shaozhen, courtesy name Guqing, a licentiate from Panyu County, Guangdong, who enjoyed reading military books, was assigned to Jiangnan with the qualification of an expectant Daotai. He was greatly trusted by Duanwuqiao, the Governor-General of Liangjiang. When establishing the Ninth Zhen New Army, he adopted the system of micro-soldiers. At that time, many scholars from literary academies joined the military service. He requested that Mr. Xu be the commander (i.e., the officers used were all graduates of military academies and possessed strong nationalistic ideas, such as Zhao Sheng, a martyr from Zhenjiang, and Bai Wenwei, an important figure in the party-state. At that time, they were all under his command, so the seeds of revolution spread very quickly). Mr. Xu trained his soldiers with the principle of "sharing joys and hardships." Seeing officers who were students returning from studying abroad wearing Western clothes, he often asked what country the raw materials were from and how much they cost. Although he did not explicitly state that buying foreign goods would lead to the outflow of rights and interests, his subordinates knew his intention, and thereafter they dared not use foreign goods again. The influence gradually permeated, and it became a common practice. During the Wuchang Uprising in 1911, Zhang Xun and Tieliang, who were hostile to the New Army, incited Governor-General Zhang Renjun to treat the Ninth Zhen with contempt, so their actions were inconvenient. During the uprising, they were defeated and retreated to Danyang due to a lack of supplies. After Suzhou was successively restored, Chen Yingshi and Cheng Xuelou, the two governors, discussed and gathered the troops of the various provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to form a joint army to besiege Jinling, and they publicly elected Mr. Xu as the commander-in-chief. After the capture of Nanjing, he was reassigned as the Nanjing Garrison Commander. Later, he followed the Premier to Guangdong and served in various important positions, maintaining integrity and self-discipline. After serving as a member of the National Government, he moved to Shanghai due to old age and illness. Although he was unable to walk well, he remained unremitting in promoting national goods. He specially made a car with a door opening in the back and a small two-wheeled cart like a child's to facilitate going out. In the Penglai City market, there were often traces of him leading his family to select and purchase national goods for household use. When Shanghai held national products exhibitions, he always went to visit. Last year, when a national products exhibition was held on the open space opposite the Great World, I had a long conversation with him. He said that promoting national goods is indeed a crucial plan to save the country, more important than any other work, because money is like blood in a person's body, and if it constantly flows out, how can the nation not be poor and weak and die young? National goods manufacturers should also research and improve the manufacturing aspect, so that they can compete with foreign goods. The common people, with the nature of loving beauty, cannot be forced not to buy foreign goods solely with the two words "patriotism." While speaking, he pointed to the clothes he was wearing and said that he had not used foreign goods for thirty years. His words are still in my ears, but who would have thought that this farewell would be a final farewell? Alas.</p>

Rumors arose in the market, saying that the issue of circulating notes was being brought up again, boosting morale. However, it was found that large accounts did not have a large amount of goods being dragged in. The general retail investors were panicked.

<h3>Cotton Buying Sentiment Reinvigorated – Closing Prices Weaker for Forward Contracts –</h3>
<p>The cotton market started weak, then became firm, and finally rose again. As a result, forward contracts weakened, but market sentiment was still tight. Due to brisk yarn sales, many parties were dragging in goods and optimistic about the market. Following the yarn market, prices rose step by step, followed by more rumors. At the closing, forward contracts suddenly fell by 25 cents.</p>
<p>Near-Month Cotton Rises Another Half Yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard cotton market in the morning, because U.S. cotton was calm, it rose slightly by two to seven points. Indian cotton fell by 0.25 rupees. Osaka cotton for three products rose by 1.2 cents. The market was ordinary, and the far month fell by 15 cents in the first auction. In the second auction, the near month also fell. Unexpectedly, in the third closing auction, the far month surged by 2.3 cents, saying that the rumors were beneficial, the buying trend was reinvigorated, and the market suddenly tightened.

<h3>U.S. Cotton Demand Can Be Called Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened, with each month falling by 12 points. In the early morning, due to the report being about to be released, the market was stagnant. Cotton farmers were hedging sales, and bulls were closing positions. The weekend weather report was excellent, all of which were the reasons for the market price not rising. Later, colleagues bought, and the market became firm. Industry insiders firmly believe that the movement of new cotton will reach its peak, and the spot demand is active, with a firm and rising base. The cloth market is quiet and beautiful, and factories have already sold until next year, with a limited intention to buy at a price. At the closing, due to short covering, it was still firm and rising, with spot prices rising by three points and futures rising by three to five points. British cotton spot prices fell by seven points, and futures fell by one point. Indian cotton short positions were dumped, and bulls continued to close positions. Cotton farmers sold at Buruch and Pinggul, but colleagues bought on dips. It is estimated that Pinggul and Buruch fell by 0.75 rupees. The price of silver was unchanged.

<h3>Piece Goods: Factory Cloth Sales in Southwest China are Relatively Smooth, Selling Prices Rise Frequently and Endlessly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market remained firm and rising, mainly because the demand from various regions was very smooth, and the selling prices gradually increased. The raw material yarn, thread, and greige fabrics were in short supply, and the urgency of customers' shipments increased. The new cross-transactions were very active. Although the selling prices of various white goods and colored goods were high, they remained the same, and the difficulty of spot goods increased. Yesterday, the Guangdong group fixed orders for more than 200 bales of fine twill, and the newly purchased light and heavy coarse cloth, thread, woolen cloth, straight tribute serge, printed satin, and cretonne were particularly abundant. They were dispatched and loaded at any time, and the current sales in Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Fujian, and other southwest regions were very active. Spot goods of various cloths were continuously collected, especially the demand for fine twill, fine cloth, thread, woolen cloth, serge, and straight tribute goods from local factories was even stronger. Goods such as blue cloth and Shilin cloth were relatively weak. Secondly, the demand for goods in various ports along the Yangtze River, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other inland regions was also urgent. This was all because of the good harvest this year, the society's economy was slightly relaxed, and the purchasing power was strengthened. In this autumn discount period, it was even more colorful.</p>
<h3>Woolen Cloth Prices are High and There are Few Patterns</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the woolen cloth transaction was very good, and the standard market price rose sharply. There were not many new patterns arriving, so the goods bought and sold on the market did not have special patterns, and the selling price was too high, so buyers complained that the price was too high, and the goods were incomplete. Rongkang Yuanchang Pinghou woolen cloth sold more than 20 pieces throughout the city yesterday, priced at three yuan. Tianxiang Hanzhong Wang six-foot velvet sold five boxes, priced at 1.6 yuan. Baoke shoe blanket woolen cloth sold more than ten pieces, priced at 7.8 yuan. Dalong Sheep City brand serge sold more than ten pieces, priced at 2.75 yuan. Yuanchang Huanghua special woolen cloth sold more than ten pieces, priced at four yuan net.</p>
<h3>Finance: Rumors of Benefits, Standard Gold Price Rises More Than Three Yuan, Large Accounts Seeking Supply is Inconsistent, Market Situation is Very Chaotic All Day Long</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was stable due to the reduction in exchange rates and the increase in raw gold. Large accounts sought supply inconsistently, and the situation was uncertain. Rumors of benefits rose, and the exchange rate fell due to recent weakness. The market situation was fluctuating all day. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in the UK and US were flat, and the forward price of Monterrey silver was unchanged. London raw gold rose by half a penny, and the exchange rates followed suit. The central bank announced that the exchange rates for the UK and US were flat, and the customs gold unit was unchanged. The standard gold price was announced to be 1146.9 yuan, and the off-site preparatory transaction opened and immediately rose to 54 yuan. Hengyu, Taidecheng, and Jiuda sold, while Yuanmao, Yongzhi, Fengyong, Fuxing, and Yongwanxing bought. It gradually rose to around five yuan. The morning opened high, and large accounts came to buy after the opening, and continued to rise. However, short sellers took the opportunity to add codes, and some spot firms sold slightly. HSBC announced that the exchange rates for the UK and US were flat and fell once. The silver equalization tax was announced to be unchanged, and buyers moved together and improved again. However, there was still a lot of struggle in the middle, and short sellers began to turn long, and the trend became firm. However, because large accounts suppressed the price at a high level, the noon situation was peaceful again. Later, the off-site retreated to around 55 yuan. Fuxing, Yongshengyuan, Yongjiu, Dalifeng followed suit and bought, and turned back up. After the opening, because Chinese firms fought to fill in spot US dollars, many parties continued to close out at a lower level and stepped down. However, buyers moved again after the low, and although Indian silver rose by three annas, it was still pulled up. The long party began to unload, and the Indian silver was reported flat twice. As a result, it was hovering. Today, I will record the market situation for the whole day.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1154.8 yuan, which was 1.7 yuan higher than the previous closing. Fuxing, Yongqing, Fayong, Wu Fayong, and Sanhu also entered, rising back to 5.7 yuan. Dadecheng Chunyuan Yongdafengheng sold at high prices. HSBC announced that the exchange rates for the UK and US were flat, and retreated to 4.3 yuan. Hengyu Tianfa Dadecheng Qiafen Yongchunyuan Yongdingkang bought in bulk, and gradually rose back to 7 yuan. Tongtaichang Chunyuan Yong took the opportunity to supply at a high level, and fell to 5.8 yuan. Tianfa Chengda retail investors still bought, and rose to 7.4 yuan again. Wanfeng Fuxing Yong Dadecheng Dingkang still had supply, falling back to 5.5 yuan. After some hovering, the noon closing was 1155.7 yuan. After the closing, it was flat and tired.</p>
<p>The after-market opening was 1156.3 yuan, and Qiafen Yongkaikang Yuanyong Fuxing Yongshunmao sold one after another, falling to 4.8 yuan. Hengyu Dadecheng Dachangxiang Hengchang Yong took the opportunity to buy at low prices, gradually rising to 7.1 yuan. Dingkang Yuanmao Yong still sold at high prices, falling to 6.5 yuan. Dadecheng Fuxing Yong entered to 7 yuan, and Yuanmao Yong still sold. The closing was 1156.9 yuan. After the closing, it was flat and tired.</p>
<p>The closing price was based on the standard gold price of the Central Bank, which was announced to be 1146.9 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 10 yuan higher. The value for this month was 1151 yuan, and the value for November was 1156 yuan. The morning water replenishment was 1151 yuan, and the red gold was increased by 8 yuan, to 1162.8 yuan. The spot market was stable, and the silver buildings still had absorption. The shacha was increased by 17.5 yuan, and Shengzhang Yongtongfenghang sold 4500 liang. The buying price was increased by 12 yuan, and the Tianjin goods were increased by 13.5 yuan, but there were no transactions.</p>
<p>The trading in the field was chaotic.

<h3>Exchange Rate Declines: Local Foreign Exchange is Loose in British Pounds and Tight in US Dollars, The Central Bank Sells Off Short-Term US Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange market declined, with loose British pounds and tight US dollars, and the Central Bank sold off US dollars. In the early morning, overseas telegrams reported that London big bar near and far were flat, the New York silver market was unchanged, and the forward price of Monterrey silver was also the same. London pure gold rose by half a penny, the UK against the US decreased by 1.875, the US against the UK decreased by 1.28125, the UK against France fell by 19 points, and the US against France decreased by 1.25. The exchange market opened with short-term selling prices, the British exchange rate at one shilling and two pence three four three seven five and three seven five pairs, and the US exchange rate at 29 yuan four three seven five, compared to the previous closing, calculated British flat and US tight zero six two five. The Central Bank announced that the exchange rates for the UK and US were flat, and the customs gold was unchanged. The people were at peace, and the banks dumped forward contracts after opening. HSBC announced that the exchange rates for the UK and US were flat, and the Chinese banks took the opportunity to supply and sell, and the process of the US dollar was loose. However, foreign banks took advantage of the loose conditions to buy, and the silver equalization tax was also flat. After that, the general trend was hovering, and the Chinese banks made slight purchases due to rumors. At noon, they gradually settled down again. In the afternoon, the banks bought US dollars and dumped forward contracts. Chinese firms worked hard to dump spot US dollars, and the process was still set, and the forward contracts were still difficult to unify, and the Chinese firms made some purchases. Until the closing selling price, the British exchange rate was one shilling and two pence three seven five, and the US exchange rate was 29 yuan four three seven five, compared to the previous closing, calculated British slightly loose and US tight zero six two five. The Chinese firms purchased approximately 300,000 yuan of US dollars. Today, I will record the market situation for the whole day.</p>

<h3>Securities: The Situation Changes Unpredictably, Public Bonds Rise Sharply and Return Slightly, Types C, D, and E Rush Out of the 60 Yuan Mark, Transactions are Highly Prosperous Reaching More Than 13 Million</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the market situation was constantly fluctuating, with rapid rises and falls. Initially, there were rumors that 700 million circulating vouchers would be issued. This statement came from a certain market, but it was ultimately confirmed by the financial community that there was no such thing. The market price fluctuated greatly with the cold and heat of people's minds. Therefore, such baseless rumors also arose with it. The market price rose excessively and fell easily. The future is difficult to be optimistic. Yesterday's opening was very good, with Premier Jiang returning to Beijing, and the negotiation situation should be able to unfold. Numbers 35 and 45, etc., especially retail investors, bought in very eagerly, and there were many who turned from short to long. The market price rose uniformly from 12 cents to 3.5 cents. The second round of trading was good, and number 35 continued to buy without stopping, and number 23 also absorbed a lot, rising again by 12 cents to 4 cents. In the afternoon opening, rumors spread about the issuance of circulating vouchers, and people were fanatical. The strong buying sentiment in the market was the best phenomenon in more than a month. And after many days of rising, C, D, and E all rushed out of the 60 yuan mark, which was especially commendable, and actually rose again by 34 cents to 9.5 cents. At the closing, rumors suddenly arose, and those who were shorting type E were still blindly following, improving by another 1 to 4.5 cents. When the type D was auctioned, the situation suddenly changed, gradually turning from tired to falling. Those who had been long before turned out of the cage, even shorting. Market rumors stated that not only was there no circulating voucher, but there were also other unfavorable rumors. Like the shadow of a snake in a cup, they disturbed each other again, and suddenly fell by 67 cents. Even the most popular type A was unstable and fell by half a yuan. However, the market price result was still a uniform rise, but the difference was too far. Type A was only 35 cents, and type E was actually 1.35 yuan. Therefore, the price change today must still have an amazing phenomenon. The total number of transactions was 13,195,000 yuan. Now I will list the results of its rise and fall in a table for comparison (unit yuan transaction unit hundred yuan)</p>
<h3>Grain: Flour Short Accounts Endure Pain to Compete for Coverage, Reversing from Falling to Rising: Far Month Jumps by 4-5 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, each month initially showed a falling trend, and in the afternoon it rebounded sharply. With the price of foreign wheat, Chicago fell by 4 cents and Canada fell by 23 cents. Therefore, when quoting prices, the market surface in each month fell by 23 cents compared to the previous day, but the buying and selling transactions were smooth. However, later, although large accounts had allocations, the people's minds were still good, so in the hovering, they returned to one cent higher. Until the afternoon opening, the situation changed greatly again, because the market rumored that the currency system would change again, saying that the circulating vouchers would be announced soon to control the country's economy. Therefore, speculative groups rushed to buy, and short sellers had to endure the pain to compete for coverage, causing the market atmosphere to soar, and compared with the previous day's closing, the far period rose by 35 cents. Looking at the current situation, half is the situation and half is the good sales, so there will be no way to grasp the future.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Rise After Initial Fall; Distant Months Rise by a Significant Eight Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Chicago wheat market opened, with prices for all months falling by two, three, or four cents due to wheat quotations from abroad. Moreover, the previous day's increase had been too rapid, making a correction unavoidable. Thus, opening prices for all months were three to four cents lower than the previous day. Later, due to profit-taking by bulls, market sentiment weakened, and prices fell another one or two cents. However, the situation changed dramatically when the market reopened in the afternoon. Initially, the flour market rebounded after falling in the morning. Subsequently, rumors of impending currency reforms led well-known speculative groups to aggressively buy, causing opening prices to jump four or five cents. Later, with strong buying interest, prices continued to rise five or six cents, resulting in a net increase of four or five to eight cents compared to the previous day's closing prices. This situation was entirely influenced by the current political situation. Currently, wheat prices have increased by five to ten cents, as mill demand remains good, and customers are standardizing and selling. Shandong Dali Ji wheat is quoted at 5.40 yuan, Guzhen wheat at 5.39 yuan, Puzhen wheat at 5.17 yuan, Huangqiao wheat at 5.25 yuan, Jiangbei wheat at 5.20 yuan (with a secondary grade at 5.10 yuan), Nanjing wheat at 5.12 yuan (with a secondary grade at 5.02 yuan), Daqiao wheat at 5.22 yuan, Huai'an wheat at 5.30 yuan (with secondary grades at 5.23 and 5.27 yuan), Wuhu wheat at 5.17 or 5.18 yuan, Yao Guan wheat at 5.35 yuan (with a secondary grade at 5.30 yuan), and Weiting wheat at 5.07 yuan. Fuxin purchased 8,000 bags, and Shenda purchased 3,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Rice Market in Hexia: Uniformly Higher Prices</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various sources was again scarce, with a total of just over 4,000 shi arriving at No. 20 warehouse. However, sales were brisk, and broker demand included 1,100 to 1,200 bags of kiln-dried Baige rice from Dalian, Qingdao, and Yantai, along with just over 200 bags of thin and broken rice. Market conditions immediately became active again. The kiln-dried Baige price rose by thirty to forty cents, thick new japonica rice increased by thirty cents, and Du Yang and other varieties of new and premium rice followed, increasing by ten to twenty cents each. Thin and broken rice also recovered by over twenty cents as a result. New Yinyuan rice was in tight supply.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over thirty sources of supply from Hexia. Various types of rice were in demand on the market. Due to tight market conditions in the city, morning trading was brisk, while afternoon trading was relatively flat. Broken japonica rice increased by ten to twenty cents, and new japonica rice remained tight, rising by twenty to thirty cents. Kiln-dried rice lacked a market. In addition to an increase of ten cents for thin rice, high-quality Yangjian rice increased by thirty cents, medium-quality rice increased by twenty cents, and Dubu premium rice increased by twenty to thirty cents. Bianqian rice remained unchanged, and premium rice was somewhat tight.</p>
<h3>Demand and Sales of Customer Xian Rice are Both Strong; Market Prospects Remain Upward</h3>
<p>The arrival of customer xian rice totaled over 20,000 bags the day before yesterday, and another 10,000 bags arrived yesterday. However, due to the seriousness of the current situation, sellers were mostly reluctant to sell and pushed prices higher, making the market increasingly firm. The Guangdong merchants have been aggressively buying unpolished rice in recent days. With both arrivals and inventory of unpolished xian rice being scarce recently, the market rose another ten cents yesterday. Other milled rice varieties also showed a slight uptrend. In addition to local merchants and Guangdong merchants, Shantou merchants and North China demand were very keen. Yesterday, Quanzhou merchants also purchased actively, and there was some activity from inland and Ningbo buyers. Therefore, sentiment and market prospects remain continuously upward. Total daily sales included 7,145 bags of Jiangxi rice, 12,000 bags of Zhejiang rice, 4,000 bags of Hubei unpolished rice, and 600 bags of Taiwan early rice.</p>
<h3>Drought Makes a Bumper Soybean Harvest Unlikely; Sesame Sales are Slow and Market is Soft</h3>
<p>Although it is said that the soybean market enjoys a good annual environment with plentiful harvests, actual reports from production areas indicate that the recent drought has greatly affected the harvest, despite the good quality of the soybeans. As a result, the market supply consists mainly of early-harvested Jiujiang soybeans, which arrive continuously, while other varieties are scarce. Therefore, future prospects are relatively stable. Demand from oil pressing plants remains strong, and sales to South China are also robust. Yesterday, a total of over 6,000 bags of new soybeans from various regions were traded, with prices increasing by five to six cents. Prices for foreign sesame are unchanged. Arrivals of raw goods have increased, but sales are slow, and the market is sluggish. It will be difficult to see improvement in the short term, and we must wait to see how foreign sales develop.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Gradually Stabilizing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend turned stable. The guild set the price for No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar for immediate delivery at 21.80 yuan and for transit goods at 6.40 yuan. No. 4 Dongbai sugar for immediate delivery was priced at 21.65 yuan, an increase of five cents, with no other changes. No. 1 refined white sugar from local factories such as Jinxin and Dahua was priced at 20.50 yuan, with Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 priced accordingly. Chaozhou merchants offered over one hundred bags of Huanggang Qing at 14.10 to 14.20 yuan, and Dali Zhuang offered one hundred and several tens of bags of Wenmian red sugar at 14.80 yuan, Yihe Zhuang at 14.10 yuan, and Hehe Zhuang at 14.30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Longans Drop Another One or Two Yuan</h3>
<p>The arrival of Tong'an longans has gradually decreased in recent days. However, an investigation of the quantity of goods arriving at different warehouses indicates that the total number is still substantial. It was reported yesterday that over one thousand boxes had been sold, falling another one or two yuan compared to previous prices. Larger sizes are sluggish and have not yet been sold.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Foreign Firms Still Finding Good Sales for Raw Silk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sales of non-foreign green tea remained sluggish. Morocco's pricing for various types of green tea is very tight, and Russian and American firms are mostly taking a wait-and-see approach. The market remains depressed. Yesterday, only Xiehe Jinlong and other firms purchased a total of over two hundred boxes of Zhenmei and Zhenmei needle tea, with prices remaining flat and weak. Only a few hundred boxes of Qimen black tea remain in stock. The Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea General Marketing Office is currently busy with settlement matters in order to close down.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Tea Industry Association, the green tea market has come to a standstill after the devaluation of the French franc. There was no significant progress yesterday. However, after several telegram exchanges between foreign firms and overseas buyers, there has been some progress in price negotiations. Yesterday, firms such as Baolong and Xiehe discussed prices for various teas, with Baolong's proposed prices for various Zhenmei teas being closer to acceptable levels. Transactions are expected to occur within the day, and the market may be able to break the deadlock.</p>
<h3>Metals: New Japanese Steel Products Arrive in Shanghai in Droves</h3>
<p>New Japanese steel products (produced by factories such as Yawata, Osaka, and Nakayama), such as new Yangyuan, angle iron, new Yang plate, T-iron, steel plate, I-beam, and black iron sheet, have recently been arriving at Mitsubishi, Huishan, and other warehouses. It is estimated that the quantity is over twenty thousand dan. However, with limited sales recently, holders of the goods are quite anxious, making it difficult to be optimistic about opening prices.</p>
<h3>400 Barrels of Zinc Sheets Sold at Fixed Price</h3>
<p>The recent fixed price for zinc sheets is £18 per ton, with 400 barrels sold by a certain British firm. The overseas price will subsequently be £18 4s per ton, so the Shanghai market is exceptionally firm. Furthermore, existing inventory is low, making opening prices even firmer.</p>
<h3>Special Article: Reply to Inquiry from Yang Wansheng Grain Shop in Xuzhou</h3>
<p>(1) The August export quantity of sesame refers to the quantity that has been inspected for export by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau.</p>
<p>(2) The table lists the quantity of sesame shipped to the United States as 54.68 quintals, which means 54 quintals and 68 kilograms. Each quintal is 100 kilograms. The "." point used in the numbers in this newspaper's table indicates that the numbers following it are decimals.</p>
<p>(3) The number of quintals that each train car can hold varies depending on the size of the car, ranging from 20 to 40 tons. Each ton is equivalent to 10 quintals. You can calculate it accordingly.</p>

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Zhang Huang)</p>
<p>A modern Miss introduced: "This is my 1936 model friend."</p>
<p>The ugliest person is rare because that is the Creator's virgin work.</p>
<p>A descendant of the Qing Dynasty has the alias "Lord of the Red Bean Pavilion." People mishear it and mistakenly think it's a "red-headed devil" with a red cloth wrapped around his head and a face full of scars. The difference in their aesthetic appeal cannot be measured!</p>
<p>What is the purpose of the straw hat on a pedestrian's head on a hot summer night?</p>
<p>Why bother teaching children harmful things? What's suitable for society isn't always...</p>
<p>It's just that asphalt roads in the summer aren't very friendly to the skin. Otherwise, women wouldn't need to wear high heels that expose their heels and toes!</p>
<p>Buying a foot of fabric for one cent is considered extremely cheap, but we haven't seen any stores advertise to exchange goods for one cent, which shows that money is still the most valuable!</p>
<h3>Fighting for a Vote</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Elections are the best system in all civilized countries in the world. Since the Republic of China, we have held several elections, but they have never been pure. When the Northern Warlords stole power, they turned elections into a pile of dirty history. How shameful! Thinking of the "magic lantern," "bedroll spreading," "coffin overturning," and "corpse swapping" that were rampant in various places at the time, I feel both angry and amused. However, in the end, they simply used money to manipulate everything, which is called "vote buying." From then on, all the good election procedures were swept away.</p>
<p>Now it's different. The election of National Assembly representatives is based on Article 1 of the National Assembly Organization Law, which stipulates that the mission of the Assembly is to "enact a constitution" and "exercise the powers conferred by the constitution." So... how important is the responsibility of the National Assembly representatives? However, the exercise of the right to elect rests primarily on the shoulders of the township and village heads. Therefore, whether the election of National Assembly representatives this time can conform to the public opinion of the people in various regions depends on what kind of people the township and village heads are now electing. Although the election by the township and village heads still needs to be circled by the commissioner and decided by the citizens, it must be known that the choice of election is not easy! Because some candidates invite people for "meals," some even "coerce," and some resort to "surveillance." Therefore, when the township and village heads reach this point, they must use their conscience to deal with it to be worthy of the people.</p>
<p>I remember an incident in Saar, where the decision of returning to Germany or France was to be decided by a referendum. At this time, a German woman living in Shanghai, after hearing the news, immediately took a plane back to fight for a vote. Think about it: she is a woman, and far away from her homeland, not nearby. Because she refused to give up her sacred duty to vote, even though it was just one vote, in terms of numbers, it didn't matter much. But! How could she carelessly ignore it? Therefore, the election of National Assembly representatives must be recognized as a very important page in the history of the Republic of China. Even those who run for election, if they do not use dirty tricks but act with a bright and upright open attitude, will naturally be respected. Who would dare to ridicule and spit on them?</p>
<h3>Research on "Bastard"</h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>Among the words used to curse people, besides all kinds of obscene and unbearable words to insult the other party's mother, wife, sisters, etc., "bastard" is probably the most severe and widespread. The three characters "bastard," when analyzed literally, mean: propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are called the eight virtues; the "loss of eight" means cursing people for losing the "shame" character in the eight virtues, which means "shameless." The word "egg" is like saying "not a thing." Therefore, "bastard" means a shameless thing. This interpretation is probably familiar to everyone and does not need further explanation.</p>
<p>However, using "loss of eight" to interpret "shameless" is plausible, but it seems like reciting scriptures, and it still feels somewhat forced. Why? Most vulgar curses originate from peasants and bumpkins. I ask, what do peasants and bumpkins know about the eight virtues? Recently, I read the fifth chapter of the novel *Unexpected Fate in Zaiyang Hall*, written by Qiu Zhai during the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, which says:</p>
<p>"Kuang Shitang received Yun's letter, opened it and took a look, and was startled. His heart felt like a little deer was bumping inside. He thought to himself, 'This matter must have been caused by the cunning procuress. If there was no such abduction, my matter of buying a concubine would not have been exposed. This time, it won't be difficult to force this procuress to write a bond of reliance, but this matter...' "</p>
<p>In the sixth chapter, Yun demanded a bond of reliance from her husband Kuang Shitang for the cunning procuress, and it was also said, "You should take out the bond of reliance from that procuress." According to this, "bastard" can also be interpreted as "procuress," and it seems that the latter is more colloquial.</p>
<p>"Procuress" means "old procuress." This word is very colloquial. Adding "yellow" is because it's a common surname, just an example. Therefore, "yellow procuress" is like "Wang Po." In short, "yellow procuress egg" means "son of a bitch." Also, when cursing someone as "yellow procuress egg," the words "muddled" are often added before it. "Tent" refers to a bed "tent": "muddled tent" is like meaning that the curtains are not in order, which is similar to "yellow procuress egg," with no distinction between high and low. Therefore, "bastard" is probably a later term, hence this study.</p>
<h3>Swapping the Nest of the Luan and Phoenix</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Brotherly Affection Hides Letters, Pities Weak Sister / Heavy Air of Poetry and Books, Peeks at Shadows, Laughs at Poor Scholars</p>
<p>Therefore, Jiang and Zhang corresponded for two or three months, and met no less than a hundred times, but still neither dared to speak first. Fortunately, this secret was not known to a third person, so the two of them could proceed slowly. However, can a secret be kept forever? There is no such thing in the world. In the fourth month after the correspondence, an accident occurred. Guoqi's letters to Menglan were always sent to the school. But by the end of June, it was already summer vacation. If the letter was sent to the school, it would take many days to reach Menglan's hands. He had also guessed from Menglan's reply that she had many female classmates with whom she corresponded. Therefore, he wrote the handwriting on the envelope more beautifully, treating it as a girl's letter, and sent it to Jiang's house. At first, two letters were also delivered to Menglan's hands as usual. One day, Menglan went to a relative's house with her mother and sister-in-law. The men, however, were all at home. At this time, a letter from Guoqi was delivered to Jiang's house. The person who received the letter was an illiterate maid. Without hesitation, she sent it directly to the master's room. Haoran put on his glasses, and was holding a book in both hands, sitting by the window in the sunlight reading. Haoran's eldest son, Wuxuan, was standing beside him, wanting to say something. At a glance, he saw the name of his younger sister on the envelope, and the postscript was signed "Zhang Ji." He suddenly felt a movement in his heart. He remembered that four or five days ago, his younger sister was sitting in the hall, and the old woman outside brought a letter, and he had greeted her in the courtyard to receive it. That shape seemed a little unusual. Looking at the letter again, it was written by Zhang Ji. It seemed that there was no such Miss Zhang among his female classmates. While Wuxuan was thinking like this, he had quickly taken the letter from the maid's hand. Haoran put down the book and asked, "Who sent the letter?" Gexuan replied, "It's a letter from a colleague of mine, asking me to pass it on." Haoran was reading with great interest, so he didn't ask any more questions and continued to read the book. Wuxuan stood in front of his father for a while, then retreated. When he got to his own room, he took the letter in his hand and carefully examined it. Although the handwriting was beautiful, it was definitely not written by a young lady. Moreover, he seemed to have seen this handwriting somewhere before. Although opening other people's letters is not allowed by morality, this matter is quite important. If there is any secret in this letter, the problem would be big if it fell into his father's hands today. So he closed the door, opened the envelope, and read it slowly. After reading it, he quietly pondered for a while, and then tucked the letter into his pocket. When Menglan returned home that day, it was already past 10 PM. Although Wuxuan met her, he didn't say a word. (82)</p>
<h3>Qingyang Moon</h3>
<p>— Ziwei</p>
<p>I took advantage of the Mid-Autumn Festival's Crown Life Troupe to go to Qingyang Port to enjoy the moon for the third time.</p>
<p>The many lanterns hanging along the iron bridge over the port still emitted colored light. Looking down at the deep blue port water, ruffled by the southeast wind, it formed patterns like fish scales. Several white boats carried young couples, drifting leisurely in the clear stream, relaxed and happy. From afar, the soft singing voice floated from the water, intoxicating, intoxicating a bit of lightness.</p>
<p>Looking up at the azure sky, a round moon, like a bright mirror, hung high, surrounded by a canopy like mist. The floating clouds, pure and clear in the blue sea, were illuminated by the auspicious moonlight, highlighting the layered peaks. At this time, the distant trees became ink spots, and a faint osmanthus fragrance filled the air. This quiet autumn moon, this cool autumn night, brought together many celebrities in one place. What joy, what happiness! I recalled Li Chongguang's line—"The old country is unbearable to look back on in the bright moon"—and couldn't help but sigh.</p>
<p>That night, because I still had some private matters, I took the night train with my wife to my hometown—Suzhou—to join in the scene of reunion. I hadn't been home for several months, and I felt that my stepmother had become much thinner, while my nephews and nieces could already babble and walk by touching the wall. Seeing my late mother's portrait, I wanted to shed tears again. That night was filled with mixed feelings of joy and sorrow, making it difficult to fall asleep.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I'll visit the owner of Zilan and chat, and also meet my brother Fan Yunshu. I'll accept his invitation for lunch at a restaurant opposite Wuyuan. In the evening, I'll take the car back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>Glimpse of the Yellow Sea</h3>
<p>— Feng Kuni</p>
<p>Under a clear sky and a cool breeze, I walked with light steps in the desolate wilderness, on the soft, velvety sand, following the traces of ox carts like iron rails. Then I saw the boundless Yellow Sea.</p>
<p>The wind was fierce, and the clouds in the sky flew quickly towards the other side. The sun emitted golden light. Many fishermen had smiles on their faces, and they were stacking fishing nets onto the carts again. The two oxen that had been lying down resting just now were pulled over again and tied to the carts. They were whipped a few times on their backs, and they roared and pulled the heavy carts forward wearily.</p>
<p>The wind calmed down a little. Standing on the beach, I felt a little unsteady and felt strangely panicked, almost afraid. But the gulls were singing leisurely and playing on the sea. And the eagles were circling over the sea looking for food.</p>
<p>The surging sea tide, from afar, I saw layers of waves rushing towards this side quickly with the wind. Suddenly, there was commotion on the sea, all the waves were pushing, and the prostrate衡 broke the quiet sky. The waves衡 violently hit the sea dike, and the water splashed up several feet high in anger, and the sea water衡 destroyed the soil of the sea dike. The sunlight reflected on the horizon, as if there were many golden snakes dancing on the water.</p>
<p>The huge fishing boats in the Yellow Sea felt small and insignificant, drifting with the undulating sea tide. The masts were raised, and they were returning majestically full of fresh goods. The ox carts on the beach were all going into the sea, gradually submerging the legs of the oxen, gradually submerging the bodies of the oxen, only seeing the noses of the oxen breathing air on the surface of the water.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the waves calmed down, and the waves gradually pushed forward, and the water on the beach receded slowly.</p>
<p>When the tide was receding, the beach was crowded with people, carrying baskets and holding iron hooks. After the tide receded, many crabs, cicadas, clams floated on the beach. They squatted down happily to catch them. They all depended on these many aquatic products to live.</p>
<p>The wind on the beach was a little cool, and my legs were a little sore, so I turned my back to the sun and stepped on the sand that had been soaked in seawater to go back.</p>
<p>Rambling Talk</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Miniature Labyrinthine Mansion</h3>
<p>— Jiang Gong</p>
<p>The life of Shanghainese people is novel, mysterious, and somewhat comical, not at all ordinary. Just the various situations regarding "housing" are already strange and diverse, showing all kinds of extremes, which is completely unexpected by people from other places. Especially the internal construction of houses, with innovative designs and ingenious ideas, can truly break all records of ancient and modern times, both domestic and foreign. Even architects who have just returned from studying abroad cannot help but be shocked and admire them!</p>
<p>In the past, during the imperial examination era, the lowest form of the eight-legged essay was called the "ink school," which was known for its piling up of redundant words. It specialized in using clichés such as "closing the door and shutting the door, covering the firewood door," "Heaven and earth are the cosmos," and the like, so-called "building houses on houses, stacking beds on beds," which the world spread as a joke. In Shanghai, when you go to many people's homes, you can often see this kind of "ink roll" style of multi-story pavilions, as dense as pigeon cages, smaller than pigeon cages, stacking beds on beds, which is not surprising at all.</p>
<p>It's just because the rent in Shanghai is too expensive, and some people, such as third-hand landlords, want to profit from it. Naturally, they have to think of ideas and come up with tricks in this small house to achieve their goals of supporting their families and making a living once and for all. Some clever second-hand landlords, with their flexible minds and superb skills, can think outside the box and transform an ordinary two-story house into a five-story building, adding more than a dozen bedrooms. Such a large place can accommodate more than a dozen or twenty households. This kind of precise design and superhuman skill can truly be praised as an economic doctor and engineering expert without shame!</p>
<p>The old-fashioned Shanghai two-story residences are usually: inside the Shikumen gate, a small rectangular courtyard, a living room in the front, and a kitchen in the back. There are only two rooms that can be officially used as bedrooms: the living room upstairs and the pavilion room. In Shanghai, honest people have no food to eat! If they honestly rent it out like that, wouldn't the second-hand landlords have to drink the northwest wind? To solve major problems such as food, clothing, marriage, and funerals, in addition to living in the house for free, is impossible unless you dream! But don't worry, they have their own magic!</p>
<p>Their first step is to build a layer of white iron shed above the courtyard, extending the living room straight to the gate, moving the screen wall backward, separating the middle with board walls into two rooms, slightly extracting a narrow aisle on the side, and finally, the space under the stairs can also be separated into a room. Therefore, there are at least three rooms. Needless to say, the kitchen is also being renovated. The living room upstairs can also be divided into two or three rooms according to the method of the lower living room. In the middle of the stairs, a mezzanine made of plywood is usually built. The clever landlords also add a mezzanine in the middle below the living room upstairs and above the living room. Upstairs, it is even more obligatory to add a larger room on the back building. The roof and the sun deck are even more naturally and justly able to add a high floor. This can probably be called a towering pavilion, not within the mezzanine. In this way, at a minimum, three or more floors can be added on top of the original two floors! As for the small mezzanines inside the pavilion room for storing items, there is no need to calculate them in detail. After this major construction, it looks like Emperor Yang of Sui's labyrinthine mansion. Although the sparrow is small, it has all five organs. When the big landlord runs over, he simply won't recognize that this is his house. The second-hand landlord pays the big landlord a rent of only twenty yuan or so per month, while the income is at least seventy or eighty yuan or so. This kind of profit-making method is more wonderful than buying your own property (but that construction fee also costs about a thousand yuan or so, so they are also making a profit on their investment!). It's just that those who are third-hand tenants, with their noses and eyes squeezed together, noisy voices, dirty air, and dirty houses, are too miserable!</p>
<p>The most miserable are those who live in the mezzanines, who don't see the sun all year round. They have to turn on the electric lights even during the day, and they can only sleep sideways and can never stand upright. It's pitiful that they have to bend over and bow their heads and can only be short people for life! In summer, when the wind doesn't blow, the stench is overwhelming, and they often get heatstroke. It's really suffering for paying money. This kind of life is probably not much different from sitting in a death row cell!</p>

<p>Talks</p>
<h3>On Heroes and Success or Failure</h3>
<p>— Fang Kewen</p>
<p>Our country's delegation to the 11th World Games has returned. Using the old saying "Don't judge heroes by success or failure," we really shouldn't ridicule and mock the athletes who returned with a score of zero. Moreover, "How our country's sent athletes will perform in the World Games was known long before they went abroad. The reason for participating is to gain experience, and because in the previous Los Angeles World Games, our country only had one participant, this time is the first formal participation. It is deeply hoped that participation will attract the attention of the entire nation... After participating in the World Games this time, the great disparity between the strong and the weak may make the people know what to strive for and what to work hard for." Therefore, we shouldn't ridicule and mock these "defeated" "heroes."</p>
<p>But although the saying "Don't judge heroes by success or failure" can be used to comfort the defeated heroes, it can't be used as a talisman for them. We still have to see how this hero failed and who said this sentence.</p>
<p>How did our heroes fail? "How our country's sent athletes will perform in the World Games?" was "known long before they went abroad." This can't be blamed on the "heroes," but when the news of the World Games came, there were things that exceeded our "prediction," such as in track events, our athletes were eliminated in the preliminary rounds with the last place, and in field events, they didn't even meet the "qualification." In ball games, we were able to win in friendly matches, but we lost to others in official matches. With such a tragic ending, is this what we "predicted" long ago?</p>
<p>It is not shameful for heroes to fail, but failure should also have a justifiable reason. If you usually have the "qualification" to compete with others, and you lose because you are exhausted, then it may be said that although you failed, you are still glorious. But our heroes are usually barely able to get the "qualification," but temporarily don't even meet the "qualification." Can this kind of failure also be "judged" by "Don't judge heroes by success or failure?"</p>
<p>In fictional novels, we often see defeated heroes say to victorious heroes: "After three years, I will come again to learn from you." Heroes who say such things either really go to implement their "gentleman takes revenge in three years" plan from scratch, or use this as a comfort to dispel embarrassment, as a catchphrase to wrap things up. We failed this time, and the "four-year revenge theory" is also being sung loudly. But is this the former or the latter? I dare not think badly, and I don't want to think badly, so let's wait and see after four years!</p>
<p>But in the high-pitched sound of this four-year revenge theory, some people also say, "This failure can also be said to be the main cause of future victory... It is better to be greatly defeated and be able to be self-aware than to be proud of a small victory, and it will not lead to the bad habit of Yelang's self-importance." It is not wrong to encourage the defeated heroes without ridiculing them, but if you give them all kinds of forgiveness, or even say that a small victory is not as good as a great defeat, as if "great defeat" is better than "small victory," I cannot agree with this. Of course, the original intention of saying this is not like this, perhaps it is just the opposite. But if you are proud of a small victory, and you don't reflect on a great defeat, then what? -- We should have the courage to settle our own mistakes.</p>
<p>Saying that you don't reflect on a great defeat may be somewhat arbitrary and close to insulting, but I think it is best to settle this account after four years: to put it another way, let's say you "win small" after four years. If the physical strength of the general public is still like this, relying only on a few "Kings" and "Fish" to hold up the scene, and you don't get a score of zero anymore, that is still a failure, because the way of sports does not exist in creating a few "sports stars," and if the "star system" in the sports world continues to exist, then even if you get a score of zero again, in the country, these athletes with a score of zero will still be unable to avoid "Yelang's self-importance."</p>
<p>Because in the country, they are still the "great generals" in "Shu has no great generals."</p>

<h3>Old Locke and Theresa (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Lin Na</p>
<p>"Theresa, you can't go on like this, you have to think about your age..." Old Locke looked worried.</p>
<p>"They...they are all so barbaric...Dad...I'm scared!" His daughter's face was red, she mumbled, head down.</p>
<p>"There's no way around it! Think about it, I'm fifty-two this year, how many more fifty-twos do I have left driving a carriage?"</p>
<p>His daughter lowered her head even further, lost in thought, not saying a word, her lips pale and trembling.</p>
<p>One day, Old Locke came home early, sat on a stool and smoked his pipe. His daughter had just returned from the coconut grove, holding a large package of baked bread in her hands, a happy look on her face, a smile on the corners of her mouth, standing timidly in front of him. Old Locke looked at her indifferently, then asked in a surprised tone: "Theresa, what's going on?"</p>
<p>"Guess, Dad..." his daughter said with a smile, looking pleased with herself.</p>
<p>Old Locke couldn't guess, so he shook his head; then she continued, "The baker on the street gave it to us, he said: Theresa, isn't your old man back yet? Didn't he leave you money to buy bread? It doesn't matter, this is my gift to you."</p>
<p>"When did he say that?" Old Locke frowned unhappily.</p>
<p>"He often pulls me into the shop and says that when I pass by! I didn't accept it before, but I did this time..."</p>
<p>"Did he make any advances towards you?"</p>
<p>His daughter's face flushed red, and she mumbled softly: "He...he loves me..." She believed that the old man's face would light up with joy because of this. However, he didn't, he looked very sad, the corners of his mouth trembling, muttering quietly in a desperate tone:</p>
<p>"This is impossible, Theresa..."</p>
<p>He knew the baker, a fat,</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>American man in his thirties. Because of his son's misfortune, the old man always felt a hatred for the white people as rulers. He often said angrily: "They have sucked the blood out of the Filipinos, and now they are imprisoning the old white folks, just so they can have more people doing forced labor for them in prison factories!"</p>
<p>Thinking this, his heart was deeply pained by hatred.</p>
<p>The heavy carriage rumbled over the cobblestone street, and soon stopped outside a bamboo fence. There was light and laughter in the house. The old man frowned, listening quietly on the carriage platform. A sharp male voice caught his attention. He suspected it was coming from that fat baker. So, he stepped over the fence gate and loudly kicked the short wooden ladder leading to the small house. Before long, the baker appeared in the small house, his daughter following behind him with a forced smile. He apologized to the old man, looking flustered and uneasy, and then strode away.</p>
<p>The old man watched him leave with angry eyes, then stood in front of his daughter and asked silently:</p>
<p>"Theresa, what's going on?"</p>
<p>"He came to propose to me, Dad... he knelt in front of me, so pitiful, tears in his eyes, saying, Theresa, marry me, my heart..." The old man impatiently stopped her with his hand:</p>
<p>"What did you say...?"</p>
<p>"I cried too, I agreed... He is a good person...I also...Dad, let us get married."</p>
<p>The old man lowered his head in despair. He thought of his son in prison, and his whole body felt unbearably hot. Finally, as if he had made a great decision, he trembled and said, "You want to marry him, fine, come with me now!"</p>
<p>His daughter climbed onto the carriage with him, and immediately they set off for the beach. That night, the old man drove the carriage back alone, sleeping soundly. From the next day on, no one ever saw Theresa again.</p>
<h3>Zhu Zixia's Boat Catching in Costume</h3>
<h3>Story of the Bamboo Garden</h3>
<p>— Shen Jiaqian</p>
<p>It had rained in the morning, but the afternoon was clear. The sky in early autumn was like a smooth leather ball, and the pale yellow sunlight peeked out from the clouds, shining on the lonely courtyard. Mao Sheng drank a little more wine at lunch, grabbed a handful of straw and made straw sandals in the corner of the wall. That was Mao Sheng's special skill. The straw sandals he wore were all made by himself, but the ones he made weren't as durable as the ones he bought, so he was often seen knotting straw in the corner of the wall.</p>
<p>Mao Sheng was an old servant of my family, who had come to my house from my grandfather's time. He must be over sixty now. But when people asked him his age, he just opened his mouth and said, "You guess." When people guessed his age, he nodded, "You guessed right! You guessed right!" He never told people his age properly. When Grandma heard this, she would scold him, "You've lived your age on a dog, you're still as mindless as a child!" He would just laugh and walk away.</p>
<p>Mao Sheng liked to tell stories, so he was especially close to us children. When he made straw sandals, the children always surrounded him.</p>
<p>"Mao Sheng, tell us about the silly son-in-law."</p>
<p>"No, Mao Sheng, tell us about Bao Gong's birth, and how the fox spirit repaid his kindness later?"</p>
<p>"Yes, didn't you say you'd tell it today?"</p>
<p>"Don't吵! Don't吵!" He spread out his hands, asking us to sit down, then raised his eyes and looked at the clouds in the sky, "I'll tell both. First the silly son-in-law, then the fox spirit repaying his kindness."</p>
<p>So he began to tell stories, starting with "Once upon a time there was a silly son-in-law..." one after another, until it was time to cook dinner and he hadn't finished half a straw sandal.</p>
<p>Today, the children had run off to play at someone else's house. Mao Sheng seemed to feel a little lonely. He was half-heartedly making straw sandals, his eyes often raised to the sky, as if "Once upon a time there was a silly son-in-law..." was about to fall from his mouth.</p>
<p>I crept up behind him and covered his eyes with my palms, asking him who it was.</p>
<p>"It's the young master, I know it without looking. Why don't you go out and play?"</p>
<p>"They've all run off, where can I go to play?" I sat down next to him.</p>
<p>"Good!" He swept away the straw, as if he hadn't intended to make straw sandals in the first place, "I'll take you to play, to dig for bamboo shoots in the bamboo garden."</p>
<p>"Don't talk nonsense, there aren't any bamboo shoots now." I didn't believe it. If you don't... follow me to dig; he grabbed my hand and led the way, taking two... from the corner of the wall, giving one... to me...(To be continued)</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Oolong Temple"</p>
<p>The weather is clear and the herbs are fragrant. Unable to dispel my sorrows, I go for a walk. I am, born with a chivalrous spirit, but hard to bend. Unexpectedly, I married Yan Xijiao, and I have to swallow my anger and turn to self-pity. Who cares about unexpected disputes? The pillow talk is unusually different. She is, like willow catkins, difficult to control. Single-mindedly, I have to search for snakes in the grass and take precautions. Oh, how annoying! Oh, how annoying! Her unrestrained behavior is not envied by Heaven. At this moment, the woman's heart has already revealed its sharpness. Oh, Yan Xijiao, Yan Xijiao, I see that you have been noisy all day long for a reason. In the end, you will suddenly resist when the dark curtain is pierced. My thoughts are confused as I walk along the street. I meet Mother Ma on the street. I have failed the fragrant quilt until now. How can I comfort Xijiao? She is, her eyes are always dry and she misses you. I still regret it and feel bored. You should know that quarrels between husband and wife are common. You shouldn't have run away with a hard heart. It is really a coincidence to meet here. I advise you to temporarily tolerate and return to your fragrant nest. My mind is faint and I am too lazy to lift my body. I am, I suddenly heard someone calling me and I was stunned. One is, an eyesore, resentment in my heart when we meet. The other is, in broad daylight, afraid that you will not come. But it is said that Sanlang is sitting downstairs. It is confusing and suspicious. This time, it is difficult to escape punishment for being unfaithful. He must kneel in the courtyard and apologize. I can use Ping Nu's hatred.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "National Flower"</p>
<p>Although the plum blossom is not the king of flowers. Its character is pure and outstanding. Since ancient times, poets have praised it. Its fame as the queen of flowers is unparalleled in the world. The chrysanthemum is a recluse among flowers. The lotus is also called a gentleman. Zhou Zi loved the lotus and Tao loved the chrysanthemum. The two had very different interests. I don't know, the plum blossom is both steady and a gentleman. Its nature is gentle, its character is high, and its appearance is dignified. People in the world often praise the peach and plum blossoms. The peach blossom is gorgeous and the plum blossom is fragrant. That plum blossom only stays content. It does not want to be fashionable and learn new makeup. It is gorgeous, elegant, and without vulgarity. It is ashamed to compete with the peach and plum blossoms. Without a good matchmaker, what harm is there? The fairy of Miaogu has no groom. Its friends in the mountains are pine and bamboo. The clear wind and moon are in the middle of the night. Those ordinary flowers can only listen to orders. Who can occupy the first spring? Therefore, it is said that the moon... the old plum blossoms open and hundreds of flowers are busy. Who knows me when the world is old and desolate? I only say that the eyes of the world are blind. But I didn't expect that Lin Hejing was still affectionate. I want to say that Meng Xiangyang is my confidant. Now that the national flower is determined, it is even more glorious.</p>

<p>###</p>
<p>In the future, more films suitable for Chinese tastes will be shown. The Cathay Theatre on Avenue Joffre, with its magnificent architecture and complete equipment, has already been praised by word of mouth, and it is said to be unique. The reservation... other first-run theaters are the same. However, this theater seems to focus on Westerners. Now, because the number of Western residents is increasing day by day, and the number of Chinese audiences in this theater is also increasing day by day, in order to facilitate Chinese movie fans in the future, the theater has decided to change its policy and show more films suitable for Chinese tastes. For example, "A Filial Son Murders His Father" I Give My Life, which is being shown today, is an example of their new plan. The story of this film is adapted from a famous stage play that caused a sensation in the United States for two years. It is sad and touching enough to earn people's tears, and its tension makes the audience breathless. The leading actors are Sir Godfrey Tearle, Francis Drake, and Tom Brown, three major stars, who perform a tragic and moving performance, which is indeed a work worth appreciating.</p>
<h3>Li Minghui and "Qingming Season"</h3>
<p>Li Minghui, this long-absent artist, has joined the Star Film Company and her first film is starring in Ouyang Yuqian's "Qingming Season". This is a work that exposes the evils of inheritance and focuses on the entanglement of women in feudal families. Li Minghui plays a maid who is oppressed in an old family; she initially loses her pure chastity due to the seduction of the owner of the family, and then suffers beatings from the mistress and abandonment from the owner. At this time, she already has a child. This poor child, as soon as he is born, encounters a fierce and cruel face, and the vicious methods of the villains. From this, a moving story develops.</p>
<p>Since starring in "Woman", Li Minghui, who has been silent on the screen for a long time, is playing an oppressed woman here; changing her past style, and collaborating with the great director Ouyang Yuqian, she is achieving extraordinary achievements.</p>
<h3>Grand Cathay Presents "Song and Dance on the Road to Success"</h3>
<p>Is a Great and Luxurious Song and Dance Film</p>
<p>The Grand Cathay Theatre originally scheduled to open "The Blood Case at the Racecourse" today (Wednesday), but due to special reasons, it temporarily changed to showing "Song and Dance on the Road to Success" Sirg Baby Sing, produced by 20th Century Fox. The story of the film alludes to the interesting history of film star John Barrymore pursuing a young girl. In addition to Alice Faye and Adolphe Menjou, there are also a large number of comic singers and movie stars who have joined, which are novel and unique, and are also rare on the screen. This film is no different from a grand gathering of stars, a base camp of song and dance, and a general mobilization of laughter. It can be called second to none in song and dance films.</p>
