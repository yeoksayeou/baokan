<p>時評</p>
<h3>調整中日國交之先決問題</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>自成都北海兩案發生以來。尙未能有妥速解决之眉目。繼踵而起者。則有豐台中日兩軍誤會衝突之警。訊有漢日租界崗警古岡庭二郞被入狙殺之凶耗。有汕頭日商廣志洋行廚房發現炸彈之虛驚。銅山東崩。洛鐘西應。詭情譎態。錯雜並呈。此數日來亦誠可謂多事不寧之秋矣。在中日國交調整呼聲最高之今日。在張羣川越正在進行外交談判之時節。而一再演出離奇惝恍之變故。豈直不勝遺憾。抑亦深堪怪詫。吾人於此。又烏得不予以密切之注意乎。</p>
<p>在此三案中。豐台糾紛比較為有顯明之事實者。究其最初肇衅之人猶復雙方各執一詞。至漢汕兩事件。則皆為莫須有之疑案。所謂華人潛置之炸彈。不過日領片面之揣想。而吉岡之是否出於華人所狙殺。迄今猶未能獲得明確之左證。且當事伴發生。我方則力求隱忍。愼重紀載。一以委婉之態度。避免</p>

<h3>華北日駐軍調查　總數達一萬四千以上　駐在北平者共四千人</h3>
<p>（天津）據最近可靠調查、平津各地、日本駐軍之數目如下、計駐在天津市內者、海光寺共二千八百二十五人、東局子共一千六百入、駐在北平者共四千人、駐在豐臺者的二千人、駐在通洲者共七百人、駐在山海關者共八百人、駐在秦皇島者共五百人、駐在南大寺者共五百人、駐在唐山者共四百名、駐在唐沽者共五百名、駐在昌黎者共三百名、駐在灤縣者共三百名、其他在北寗路沿綫及留守營等、每處駐一百七八十名不等、以上各地駐軍、均採取戰時編制、允以平津豐台唐山四地、附有機器化學大隊、實力更為可驚、（二十一日華聯電）事態之擴大。日方則憑持意氣。張大其詞。不惜運用强硬之手腕。以造成嚴重之局勢。甚至吉岡遇害地點。明明在其崗位。而發言人亦竟認為有移屍滅跡之可能。斯其用意所在。尤難令人索解。今豐台事件。已吿解决。我駐豐台部隊。撤往趙莊一帶。圖窮七現。眞相灼然。我方為欲表示其誠意。固已極盡退讓之能事。彼高唱提携論之日人。又將如何宣示其誠意耶。</p>
<p>平心而論。以中日提携為號召。原亦吾人之所企求。顧就今日情勢以觀。實難免令人有南轅北轍之戚。種種不幸事件之發生。姑勿問其背景之何若。要為出於疑猜之結果。而每度事變中。日人所採之嚴峻手段。張大宣傳。及其終局之非分獲得。允足以增進我國一般人民之反感。如此演變無。止必且釀成無法融會之局面。夫豈彼此邦家之福。吾人於恫念之餘。猶欲竭忠盡慮以正吿於日本賢明人士曰。在此進行調整國交聲中。日方果無誠意則已。如猶有此蘄嚮。則所謂調整國交云者。實應以調整國民情戚為前提。而調整國民情戚之先决事項。則為一·放棄機詐之手段。樹立懇摯之對。策二·消除疑沮之觀念。激發諒解之精神。三·改變猙獰之面目。採取溫和之態度。能注意於此三點之改進。則彼此國民問之情戚。必能獲得迅捷之轉換。然後再依正當之步驟。從事外交之折衝如此中日國交。不煩幾多調整。卽可入於親蕃提携之坦途矣。</p>

<p>匯市昨以海外匯兌雖升而不多、一天形勢平庸、晨初以海外銀市、倫敦大條近遠俱升〇六二五、紐約則停、蒙得里遠期銀價勿動及長一厘不等、倫敦生金跌一便士、英對美升一二五、英對法漲三磅音、美對英升〇六二五、美對法縮〇六二五、中央銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、海關金單位跌二厘、匯市晨開近期賣價英匯一先令二便士、八一二五及三一二五對搭、美匯一二五及一八七五對搭、較之前收計英美俱平、開後日行雖扒東匯、但外商銀行則塞英美兩匯、匯豐銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平而徘徊、白銀平衡稅揭曉升半分、雖有華商扒結、銀行續有塞出、午刻以銀行扒遠拋近、大勢平庸、後市成交有限、印銀初次報升一安那、二次勿動、結果亦未有變化、收盤近期賣價英匯一先令二便士二八一二五及三一二五對搭、美匯三十元一二五及一八七五對搭、較之上週六計英美俱平、華商及銀行扒塞俱有、今將一天成交錄後、</p>

<h3>證券　掉期交易多　公債市況堅穩</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、市況全以供求不同、掉期關會自經委派為升降與環境上種種情形大都不發生連帶關係、交割祗餘三日、數目雖少、亦尚略有傾軋、趨勢堅穩、卽絕無希望之九六、亦被提高一角左右、復又衝出十元大關、陣線縮短、攻守不致倉皇失措、故有此極為鎮靜之態度、昨日經過、開盤初則稍有恍惚、入後漸漸趨漲、比前反漲一二角、次盤散戶空頭鑑於無回小希望、零星抵補及掉期較湧、又好一二角、市塲人心、對於做空、均不敢下手、午後開盤、故仍因空方掉期而續堅一角左右、收盤祗一二種略小五分一角、甲種又漲一角、本月已到六十九元、市價結果好一角至三角半、成交總數、共計四百八十七萬元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於後、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紗花　滯貨無意收進　本月紗愈覺不振　遠期同業拉進略堅</h3>
<p>紗市晨跌午回、但本月趨勢依然不振、蓋以浮多無意收貨者眾、加之市傳有一部份滯貨、更乏人歡迎、故市狀愈虛、跌破二百元關門、但遠期現紗情形良好、同業拉進不棄略堅、然海外紗花市況、日趨平疲之途矣、</p>
<p>近期進二百元關</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月繼續下降、蓋以本月期交割期近、僅剩二天營業、聞有數千包套利紗必交無疑之說、此種標紗、據云一時銷路殊滯、因此本月市態愈虛、敲破二百元關口矣、遠期牽入漩渦中、但同業有一部份鑒於存紗較前減少、仍傾向多方、然倉庫中籌碼尚在二萬六千包外、而裕大·泰興·明德·望泰興·大昌成·長豐等賣出甚夥、惟賡豐·昶記·同和·信誠·則稍有購進、結果本月較上日收盤價跌一元二角、遠跌四五角、午後開盤、本月散多仍有軒結、遠漲四五角、查賣出聚興一千六百包、裕大二千四百包、明德一千一百包、望泰興一千包、大昌成三千五百包、長豐一千包、恒昌九百包、永昌八百包、潤康七百包、買進大豐九百五十包、錦昌八百包、賡豐一千〇五十包、昶記一千一百包、興昌九百五十包、仕豐一千二百五十包、泰昌一千四百包、信誠二千三百五十包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>現紗售價漲跌互見</p>
<p>現紗銷路尚佳、查全日各幫買去統計一千包、售價漲跌五角、各幫買額列下、</p>
<h3>新花來源漸增　標花市氣一挫　所中陳棉傳已削價售出</h3>
<p>棉市平靜、氣勢衰弱、實緣天時順利、與棉花採摘、受惠匪淺、兼之美棉趨勢不佳、幸印棉市況較昂、各路新花上市漸見湧旺矣、</p>
<p>遠月各跌一角許</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、市塲議論、大都看好、謂交易所在八月期收進之陳棉業已削價、掃數售於某某花號、轉解廠根等說、共計五萬多担、其中粗絨花一萬担外、然頭盤開出、多方雖活動而氣勢仍挫、書因邇來天時順遂、新花正在湧汛之際、兼以美棉趨勢不佳、各月一律敲破一角二分關口、各路來源有漸增湧之望、市面仍乏興奮力量、澄記·長和·聚興·達記·明德·合興·義成·大昌成一致賣出、惟裕康·振大·瑞大·興昌·森康協成·同和·益康等則買進標花、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌五分至二角、午後開盤平庸、跌五分至一角、一盤平平、三盤以紗市回漲、枱面稍乾枯、跳起一二角、收盤尚堅、結果各月比上午收盤價漲五分至一角、查賣出長和九千担、大昶九千六百包、賡豐三千五百担、生源一千五百担、大昌成一千三百担、義成三千担、達記一千二百担、聚興二千三百担、澄記二千四百担、大孚三千四百担、裕大二千五百担、福康二千八百担、買進仁豐二千七百担、慎記二千五百担、興昌二千担、森康一千七百担、慎昌一千五百担、裕康二千二百担、潤康二千六百担、錦昌一千八百担、同和一千四百担、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>新姚花到頭日旺</p>
<p>現棉消費平凡、廠需尚稱不薄、來源姚花一萬包、開價三十四元六角、通花到一千二百包、開價四十九元二角至六角、</p>
<h3>三品紗花續見下跌</h3>
<p>二十一日大阪電、三品期紗跌七角至一元六角、近月為二百十三元五角、遠月為二百零二元九角、期棉跌六角至九角、近月為二百六十三元七角五分、遠月為六十三元六角五分、</p>
<h3>印棉收成尚稱不惡</h3>
<p>上週孟買棉未隨美棉上漲、故新近國外市況不振、此間亦未受若何影響、布疋需要、雖見進步、然廠家進花、未見增加、蘭開夏及大陸略有交易、日本則購買平果爾及奧姆辣、棉收情形、大致順利、惟有若干棉區、因雨水過多、質量均已受損失、</p>
<h3>糧食　現貨小於標準　麵粉多頭出龍頓旺</h3>
<p>昨晨粉市開盤、本月份初時略有抵胃、微呈穩秀、惟洋麥報訊、利物浦跌去一辦士弱、而實銷去胃、未見發展、且現粉開價、較標準別小數分、因此人心向下、十月份以次、卽趨下游、本月多頭、收貨心思益懈、二盤出籠、頓見旺盛、與遠期取同一步驟、惟業外進胃、意興未蘭、乘機收取、亦尚熱鬧、因此三盤以後、漲落互見、一路呈盤旋之態也、結果與週末收盤價相較、本月份跌一分半、十月十一月各小一分二釐半、一月份小一分、十二月二月各小半分云、</p>
<h3>浮多回出　本月麥驟小四分</h3>
<p>昨晨期麥開盤、本月份以交割漸近、適洋麥報價告落、浮多無意收現者、乘勢回出、盤面驟降四五分、嗣以粉價報跌、遠期購胃、亦形趨趄、各月份小去二三分不等、迨午後以現麥交易、福阜兩廠雖無進取、而日商有以五元〇五分辦去蚌埠五河等麥三百噸之說、市塲人心、轉趨穩定、且交易清淡、故下午盤面、無大變更、綜計全日價格、較諸週末、本月份跌去四分、十一月份小一分、一月份小三分、二月份不動、十月十二月各小二分云、</p>

<h3>八月份芝蔴出口大減</h3>
<p>據實業部上海商品檢騐局報告、八月份芝蔴出口、計六、二八一·六〇公担、較去年同月之四七、四五〇·八六公擔、銳減四一、一六九·二六公担、本年八個月總出口數量為五〇四、八五二·八〇公担、較去年同期亦減少一一二、〇七一·四二公担、至其衰落原因、大抵由以國際消費降低、歐銷異常呆滯、美荘亦頗形不景、雖日本及意國進胃較濃、然統盤計算、終未能如去年之旺盛、此本年芝蔴外銷未許樂觀也、茲將八月份芝蔴出口數量與去年同月比較列表如左、</p>
<p>八月份芝蔴出口數量統計——單位——公担——</p>
<h3>粵幫採辦糙秈萬餘包</h3>
<p>連日客秈到頭不絕、每日八九千包至二萬許不等、前昨到頭仍湧、存積日厚、市面似有逐步趨落之象、惟昨日粵幫採辦糙秈極旺、成交糙靖等萬餘包、本街汕頭北洋天津寗波各幫均有應酬、惟機米以存到兩旺、價仍回小四五分至近角、而糙秈被粵幫暢辦、市面尚平、然人心亦復趨軟、全日開出江西米四千二百二十包、湘米一萬二千五百包、其他均無進出云、</p>
<h3>河下米去路仍清</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各幫來源共到二十四五號、貨共五千餘石、銷塲本街常呈不振之象、包胃雖辦有五六百包、然都選高貨、致如薄稻市況鮮特者平定、餘則跌落一二角不等、厚早粳賴到稀勉住、東新廠貨缺而守原盤、河下則削下一二角、新蘆尖到旺亦然、價低一二尺不等、洋尖隨帶軟、陰元平平、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各地來源卅七八號、市上各貨去路破粳薄稻新客尖陳羊尖交呆、新羊尖西新粳勒價稍化、新埠尖揀巧續取、市價破粳新埠尖小角許、西新粳羊尖價削二三角、白元東新粳價形平定、</p>
<h3>新芝蔴售價堅定　黃豆趨勢亦穩</h3>
<p>新芝蔴來源不絕、去路有東洋幫蟬聯採辦、本街零星銷塲及湊做洋荘貨者進胃、均屬不弱、故人心看好、貨戶扳緊、致市塲交易反稀、計開沙市蔴一百五十餘包、碭山蔴七十五包、南京蔴五包、行情無變化、洋荘開盤交易、星期六晚曾開三百噸、價為十一元九角、昨市有十一元九角半一百噸、後由十二元、未成交、黃豆趨勢頗穩、榨油廠因豆油價上砌餅市穩定、故豆胃不懈、昨辦去漢口早黃一千二三百包、清江浦豆二百包、窰灣豆百餘包、其他南洋去路似福州泉州汕頭廣幫及本街等、均有問津、共成交各豆、二千四五百包云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　紗線堅漲棉布益俏　長江豫魯新交易旺盛　客家辦貨須先期訂購</h3>
<p>昨棉布市氣仍佳、各路現貨需要日增、現下標紗花趨勢雖平、定現紗線堅俏而乏現貨、致棉布白貨花色貨市勢益趨繁榮、現貨大感恐慌、客家辦貨莫不先期訂購、逐漸候派、不然卽難獲得、昨粵幫續幫本廠線呢·細布·細斜·粗布·直貢·嗶嘰三百餘件、其他南路滇·閩等幫、辦胃亦一致濃厚、成交各達二百餘件、然一部份添貨、均以缺貨及加價關係、暫難成交、蜀幫津幫新成交均稀、裝貨仍夥、而長江沿線、豫魯內地各路、新成交及交裝花絨白絨籃布色斜線呢花素直貢嗶嘰色丁均極暢旺、各貨市盤續佳、白貨新裕振泰大生寳興等廠重磅粗布增價每疋五分、花色貨線呢亦增價碼五厘之譜、</p>
<h3>呢絨銷路無一不暢</h3>
<p>昨呢絨市面良好、各貨趨勢俏俐、標準行情穩固、交易零　俱盛、除本街暢銷外、平·津·青島·京·鎮·杭·甬各方、動辦亦旺、直貢·嗶嘰·華特呢·海令棒·海力司·師泡推克四·平厚呢·黃呢·麥爾登·人字呢·馬褲呢之類、銷路均盛極一時、華波沖師泡推克四、　批現交為六元六角、美最時順風得利六元半、瑞興黃呢二元四角、寳達一元九角、</p>
<h3>絲茶　江浙秋繭收成不佳　本市絲價升漲甚速　惟持價太高交易反見停頓</h3>
<p>昨日本埠絲市、因江浙今秋繭收不佳、咸皆滕漲、廠商更堅持觀望、不願輕售、茲悉無錫繭價、當在二十七八元之間、杭州則在三十三四元左右、其餘宜興等區、大致與杭屬相若、而上海白廠經字二〇二條份之本反絲、廠商討價、又復升至六百四五十元、天臺羅濱漢等級之持價為六六〇元、蜂鵲雙虎等級約在六七〇元許、而外銷絲交之討價、當另加洋行開銷十五元許、方能成交、諸如此類之持價、因騰漲過速、致交易停頓、洋荘絲市、更覺寂寞、用戶方面昨僅少數售開、如斑馬牌白廠售盤為六百六十七元半、已較上週漲十七元半云、</p>
<h3>珍眉綠茶略有走銷</h3>
<p>昨日洋荘綠茶市況、依然清淡、全市僅祗同孚天祥錦隆永興等行、買進珍眉蝦目等綠茶、共計三百七十餘箱、珍眉售開一百零五元、蝦目售開五十三元、較上星期無變動、其餘針眉秀眉等貨、均趨平疲、至祁門紅茶、昨日仍在繼續談判中、就現時情形觀察、仍以汪裕泰全部為有望云、</p>
<p>又據茶業公會報告云、綠茶市況仍然清靜、各行上週去外洋珍眉等兜銷電報、昨星期一未能得轉音、是以交易極稀、惟白頭行辦貢熙尚稱活躍、續有數百箱成交、及同孚協和各進屯溪及遂安抽珍數十箱、售價較前略差、平水茶大幫美荘久無交易、昨錦隆接買方來電後、開始拆辦五幫、均是中下檔珠茶、售價與前尚相仿、市情較上週略形活動云、</p>
<h3>糖市　荷粗白到萬餘包</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢穩秀、公會劃盤二四粗砂白、現貨呌二十一元五角半、轉口貨六元六角、東白四八九號均原價未動、本廠綿白金心·大華·一號均二十元半、餘照退、號盤有廣潮幫開出海南赤五百餘包、十四元、比升一二角、又黃崗青數十包、十四元半、建幫開出刁青七百餘包、十三元、比升二角、荷粗白山芝沙丹尼輸入口運到一萬六千四百五十二包、</p>
<p>合組公司、昨為本週第一次標兌粵粗白之期、計總定額為九千餘包、標價如前、當售出順德廠五羊粗白一千四百八十包、曲溪廠又十包、二十一元、市新廠又一千包、二十一元二角、又中砂白二百零五包、十九元三角、</p>
<h3>五金　比廠罷工　白鉛皮頻漲不已</h3>
<p>白鉛皮近日海外連電報漲、據查其原、實因比利時工廠罷工所致、本埠白鉛皮到貨向以比貨為最多、雖德波諸國亦有來貨、然為數甚少、故市塲均以比貨為暢銷品、近因比國定貨均要改遲三個月方可裝船、致申市存底、此後不免有斷檔之虞、標準大漲不已、刻市交易亦比前為眾多蓋廠家方面、深恐此後有缺貨故也、查前昨共銷去四五百梱、行情比前加起二三元不一、如二號每梱沽一百五十二元、三號一百四十元、四五號一百三十元、六七號一百二十七元、八號以上則沽一百二十五元至一百二十八元不等、據最近市塲人心之觀測、恐來市行情一時不易見鬆也、</p>
<h3>統計　八月份桐油畫輸出概況　外銷銳減——內銷旺盛</h3>
<p>據實業部上海商品檢騐局　告、八月份桐油出口、計三、一二八·五六公擔、較去年同月之七、七一九·〇四擔、計減少四、五九〇擔、本年八個月總計較去年同期亦減少二萬五千餘公擔、可見本年桐油輸出日形衰落、大有每況愈下之趨勢、月來英美銷路呆滯、殆有以致之、</p>
<p>本年桐油內銷、則反見進展、如青島·煙臺·天津等幫、勵辦異常活躍、故上海對各口輸出、就本年為首八個月之總數與去年同期比較、均增五千公擔、幾及一倍之總數與去年同期比較、約增五千公擔、幾及一倍之巨、觀於八月份輸出之旺湧、益見前途之有望也、茲將八月份外銷與內銷桐油數量、分列兩表如下、</p>

<h3>鞋…笏…袍</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>崑山顧亭林先生『遺履』一只，向在千墩鎭顧祠內，珍藏至今，猶憶二十餘年前，平泉書屋開書畫展覽會於成都路，顧氏後裔携滬陳列其間，幷天下郡國利病書手鈔本一部。惟顧之鞋其大逾恒，見者莫不驚異，以為昔賢之脚寸，其尺度逈不猶人，則其軀幹四肢之偉大，更可想已。</p>
<p>歸有光，亦崑山人，幼時議書，其大母愛孫備切：一日，過其軒，日，『吾兒，久不見若影，何竟日默默在此，大類女郎也』。比去，以手闔門，自謂日，『吾家讀，久不效，兒之成，則可待乎』？頃之持一象笏至，曰『此吾祖太常公宣德間，執此以朝，他日，汝當用之』。此熙甫自言之，而此象笏，今不知其子孫尙能保存乎？</p>
<p>又明閣臣顧鼎臣，其冡孫某，自崑山遷於吾邑之東南三十里，名廠頭地；其家藏有相袍一襲，長一身有半，並記事笏一，高可二尺許，每歲春秋，常奉以齊祭云：今亦不知流落何所矣。誦竇山楊梓香先生詩，『閣臣事業已冰銷，袍笏飄零感勝朝，丞相祠前重回首。胸中愧儡酒難澆』。令人感喟不置已。</p>
<h3>銀杏</h3>
<p>— 大木</p>
<p>銀杏俗名白果，樹很高大，枝葉濃茂像傘形，夏天時候在銀杏樹下乘凉是最好不過的，而頂大的優點，是不跟其他樹一樣的有刺毛蟲和野蠶跌落人身上。結實和杏子差不多，皮色是黃的，去掉外面的皮肉，裏面的白壳核心，就是白果了。普通是把白果從樹上打下，任其爛掉外面的皮肉，因為省事。</p>
<p>上海不容易找到銀杏樹，半淞園，兆豐公園…也沒有吧。銀杏樹的生長確實難，往往祖父手裏種植的，到孫子手裏還未必有白果可吃。然而，上海人白果是不愁沒有吃的，秋風初起馬路上就有呌賣白果的聲音出現了，句子眞像歌詞，聽吧：「燙手熱白果，香是香來糯又糯，白果賽過鵝蛋大（音杜），一隻銅板賣三顆，兩隻銅板賣七顆，要吃就來數，勿吃就挑過！」</p>
<p>據一位朋友說，這賣白果的詞句，可以唱作靑衣流水板，字眼當然要加减點。再細細玩味起來，有一點小發現，響如說，白果那裏有像鵝蛋大的呢！小販偏偏要嚷「鵝蛋大」，明明是欺人之談，其實在上海這大市塲裏，不切實際的宣傳是洋洋盈耳，小販子們的一二句形容，已算誠實了。况且，兩隻銅板可以便宜一顆，更為「實事求是」的優待辦法。</p>
<p>故鄉大伯伯後門口有兩棵銀杏樹，十六歲在家鄉的時候足有五六抱，八九年來，料想長的更粗大了，可是，聽脫最近被村上的老鄉紳用最低代價强行買去，理由說是妨碍他新樓房的風水，被鋸掉了。古董的頭腦眞迂腐得可笑，而窮困的大伯伯連僅留的「祖蔭」都無端的被剝奪，亦太可憐了。</p>
<p>由大伯伯的銀杏樹又想起前些日子有一伴悽慘的「社會新聞」，一個借了「印子錢」賣白果的小販，被江陰街流氓索陋規不遂，被踢死了自己的孩子…生活道上，寸步荊棘，寫銀杏寫到這裏，眼前突覺黯然…</p>

<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第六回　鐵面見親心語瞞鸚鵡　蛾眉存俠氣典問崑崙</p>
<p>友梅道：這是你誤曾了我的意思了。我並不是說你作了什麼不道德的事。但是我們生在這個時代裏，不能像以前的女子，聽憑別人去支配一生的幸福，作一輩子的家庭奴隸。假使你有這點意思，在社會上又有這種同情於你……不對不對，我這話不應當這搽說。社會上有人同情於你，你忽麼又會知道呢？我的話是很隨便的說出來了，讓你一問，倒問得我無話自圓其說。友梅說到這裏，自己反把兩個臉腮，漲得紫血灌了。坐下來，將桌上一張小小的白紙塊，只管折疊個不休。夢蘭對他看了一看，因道：我不妨對你說實心話。我的婚姻是從小就訂定的，現在是已成事實十幾年了，我若要推翻的話，大事上要發生一種很大的變動。我的父母都很疼愛我，那我非傷盡二老的心不可。但是我心裏也很明白，我們一生的幸福，不能為了顧全家庭的體面，斷送乾爭。可是我又糊塗了，不知道是受了舊書的毒，也不知道是受了宗敎思想的毒，我簡直沒有道勇氣，可以抵抗舊禮敎的壓迫。為了這一點原故，我自己怨恨我自己無用，理智和情感，終日的起着衝突，鬧得我就成了這種林黛玉式的姑娘，其實那種詩禮人家害肺病的可憐虫，决値不得我們去學他。至於你所說到社會上和我同情的人，那或者是有的……他說到這裏，把話頓了一頓，接着道：但是我還不知道這種人在什麼地方。他說話的時候，全是正正經經的樣子，說到了這句話，却在臉腮上微微的露出了笑容來。友梅笑道；你這倒是心眼裏的話。但是只要你認為社會上還有這種人，那倒不必去管他。假使有那種機會……（七七）</p>

<p>近來上海戲劇界裏河北評戲的勃興，可說是意外的。巳往的演員，有白玉霜，芙蓉花輩，現在又有朱實霞，朱紫霞的異軍突起，眞司謂是評戲的鼎盛春秋了。戲劇亦是藝術之一，除供人欣賞之外，還　有移風易俗的使命，所以取材不得不愼，詞句不得不研究，總以不傷大雅，從藝術方面去博得一般觀者的同情，才可算為上乘。換句話說，亦可以算得是藝術的成功；巳往的演者，專以媚態動人，詞句俚俗，殊不足取。觀後味同　　，因此引起一般人的指摘，同時亦影響到整個的評劇前途不少。最近朱寶霞與紫霞在大世界搭班，日夜滿座，一昨偶往觀聽，深覺朱氏姊妹的技藝，確乎不同凡俗，身段扮相，大有可取；咬音淸晰，字字有勁，表情更刻劃入微，官嗔宜喜，宛如劇中人復生，詞句風雅，頗有詩意，而嫵媚處更能不落粗俗，力矯惡習，實屬難能可貴。盛譽所歸，洵非倖致。尙望朱氏姊妹努力目勵，不為習移，挽狂瀾於已倒，則評劇前途，庶有厚望</p>
<p>短訊　夙以提倡衛生敎育，灌輸保健知識見稱之康健世界月刊，現已出至第十一期，文字精醒，有益身心，第二卷起將增加篇幅，大事革新，預定全年一元二角，在本年十月底前逕向上海同孚路二一四弄一四號預定，特價祗收一元，承贈二冊，謝謝。</p>
<h3>寫字間外的秋</h3>
<p>— （曼）</p>
<p>外面下着細雨，一陣狂風，吹得雨絲在空中亂舞，滿空都呈灰白色。小島在籠中，只是吱吱的呌，或是覺得秋太蕭條可怕了。庭中幾枝矮芭蕉，還有幾朶紅色的花存着，可憐它被風雨吹殘得毫無一些生氣了。</p>
<p>我坐在辦公室裏，伏在寫字檯上，不停的撥着算盤珠，抱着服務精神，不甘露出女子弱點，男女本來是平等，我女子弱在那裏？忽覺得身上打起寒慄來了。抬頭向聰外一望，呀！秋何蕭條乃爾？風呀，雨呀！盡量的下着吹着把一切溽署煩然，吹到那兒去了。</p>
<p>回顧諸同事，一個個埋頭寫着，他們忘記了春，忘記了夏。更忘記了秋，為了生活，就遺棄了日然。不，請你們放下紙筆，向應外一望，秋會給你幽深的感覺！</p>

<h3>閒話北海</h3>
<p>— 乃令</p>
<p>本文所要說到的北海，並不是北平的北海，而是廣東省南路的一個小商埠。這小商埠讀者們向一怕沒有聽說過吧？但是自從北海日僑事件發生之後，報紙上天天漏臉，北海兩個字便較為不生疏了。</p>
<p>究竟北海是一個怎樣的地方？好吧，吿訴你：北海是一個只有幾條直的，幾條橫的小型馬路的小商埠。這小商埠雖然是廣東南路一個頗為重要的口岸，差不多隔日就有大輸船開往香港，廣州灣，海防，但是那種可以讓輪船停舶的碼頭却一直到現在還沒有。從香港開來的輪船，在很遠的海面上便拋錨，旅客與貨物則由小舢板划上陸地。</p>
<p>北海當初開闢為商埠的時候，據長輩說是一個很有希望的口岸，除北海左近的合浦等地與附近鄉村的特產，如海產，燕窩，沙蠶，猪玀，草袋，等物由北海這口岸還出之外，廣西省的特產，欽州雷州的特產，也是集中北海，然後再由北海運出。同時從香港運入的麵粉，雜貨等等，也多由北海轉運至合浦，欽雷，以至廣西省。就是北海與安南的海防一埠的貿易，在往時也是佔很重要地位的，但是自從廣西的梧州闢為商埠之後，廣西進出口的貨物，多數不須由北海轉運了。另一方面，因為各種特產的生產量减少了，又因為香港的市塲受到別地方的貨物的打擊，比方：過去北海開往香港的輸船，每隻船上一定載滿了猪玀，可是自從大連猪在香港傾銷之後，北海的猪玀生意便受到影響了。這樣一來，北海的商業只有一落千丈，且影響到市政方面的建設。如果我們找遍了北海，舊式的搖手電話機大概只有三四十隻，汽車也不會多幾輛的，馬路更是不用說的了，一丈六尺闊的馬路在北海大概只有珠海中路一條。</p>
<p>北海是在合浦縣的西南方，合浦縣是有名的產珠地，「珠還合浦」的合浦就是這兒了。合浦現在還遺留着一個「東坡亭」，據說蘇東坡會經在北海與合浦住過好些時候。</p>
<p>北海合浦兩地的語言，除一部分是客家話之外，大多說的是廣州話；不過跟廣州的有多少不同。講到文化生活，則有點太「那個」了，找遍合浦北海，只不過找到一個縣立合浦中學，這中學是在北海市的東北郊，建築方面倒也不錯，附設的圖書館也可以讓外人進去閱覽：但當三年前筆者回鄉去探視家族時，北海一帶就連一家報館也沒有。</p>
<p>北海一帶的農民生活很苦，所以欽廉的農人子弟多數跑出來當兵。粵中名將陳銘樞，香翰屏等便是合浦縣人，新近才下野的陳濟棠則是欽縣人。至於十九路軍的下級軍官與兵士等，差不多半數以上都是欽廉人，因為過去粵中各部隊的招兵買馬，全跑到這有不少的過剩農民的欽廉來，另一個原因，卽為：欽廉人能够吃苦，能够服從，招欽廉人來當兵士，是冉適合沒有的了。</p>
<p>但到欽廉來招兵的人，時常也應用欺編的手段，比方：招兵處派出當地的土痞流氓，深入各鄉去籠絡一般年靑的農民，這些農民正因農村不景氣而陷入游手好閒的境狀中，土痞流氓便假做跟他們愛好，慫恿他們去賭博，嫖娼，同時還借錢給他們去用，到了相當時間，便用威力逼他們還債，他們常然沒法償債，於是便再應用利誘威逼的手，逼他們答允做入伍兵。</p>
<p>這些入伍兵，都是由各鄉運來北海，再由北海運往廣州訓練，但半途有些悔悟了的，他們不願離開家鄉的他們只得趁機逃逸。筆者就會經親眼見過一個人伍兵不願在北海登上開往廣州的輪船，他躱在帆船的艙底，後來因被搜查而跳下海裏，結果是給船上的軍官用手槍射向海裏，把他的頭顫打破了，流出來的血，染得滿海差不多全變紅色。</p>

<h3>廚師底權威（下）</h3>
<p>— 黃貽清</p>
<p>須知火是您廚師唯一的喫飯儂伙。喫的東西，非眼前經過十分到家的火力，休想穩妥可靠；盛東西喫的器皿，非眼前經過十分到家的火力或燃力，休想穩妥可靠；深揩抹器皿的布，非眼前經過十分到家的熱力，也休想穩妥可靠。您最大的權威，在致病生物看來，就是您是直接用火力殺牠們的一個劊子手：要是您馬虎虎，不盡本分，那末牠們也正求之不得，您也就是容縱致病生物殺害人們的大奸賊。固然，在一方面說來，食物煮得過久，反易減損蛋白質的易消化性，例如雞子煮得過老，自然不及煮得嫩的容易消化。不過烹煮食物，如何呌熟，如何呌老，如何是恰到好處，您既然做了廚師，也該熟能生巧，自有把握的</p>
<p>又須知「手腳乾凈」是您廚師唯一的「賣相」您的人，手，和指甲不乾凈，賣相當然算不得好；刀，剷，杓，鍋等等動用器具擦洗得不乾凈，賣相當然算不得好；米魚，肉，菜蔬等等生食物淘洗得不乾凈，賣相當然算不得好；生食物非採辦得十分鮮潔，食物的賣相不好，也就是您自己的賣相不好：熟食物非庇護得十分周妥，在食之前，蒼蠅麕集，塵土堆積，不知避免，都只是為了您的賣相不好。伍樂福說的沒有「臉」，就是為此。您最大的職務，在致病生物看來，就是您是專司防備牠們闖進的看家人；要是您糊裏糊塗，戒備得很鬆懈，那末對您不起，莫怪牠們拆了您的臺！清潔固然不就是衛生，衛生的關係方面委實太多，不過在廚言廚，實在可以說得清潔總是合乎衛生或近乎衛生的。</p>
<p>可是進一步說，廚師調味，口味的　淡要隨了主人或顧客的脾胃做去，食物的支配，料理，和保障，也那裏會有全權處理。例如主人或專喜喫肉，不喜喫青頭菜或是顧客偏嗜油榨的菜，不喫炒菜或清燉的菜，廚師的克盡厥職以外，却還仗主人和顧客「自求多福」地好好兒去尋求。在家庭間，主持家政的主婦，對於這種常識和指揮能力，尤其不可或缺。事關上請廚師料理食物的大家庭，也能有多少？大多數家庭，廚房裏事無鉅細，須得主婦躬親料理；少數家庭用了傭僕，還得主婦步步當心，著著訓練，才會「入調」。那末我始終要問：我國近年女子的普通教育，對於這種，實用知技，可曾施過了深切的訓練沒有？怕直到現在，這也還是主張改造教育的人所應該想法補充的。</p>
<p>末了，還有一點，也是值得注意的，就是廚師若使是個結核病人，花柳病入，麻風病人，他的不應引用，固然還容易知道，但是若使外貌是健康人，「手腳」也很乾凈，而骨子裏是個糞傳病或痰唾傳染病的永久病郵，暫時病郵，或間歇病郵，他的危險性或且大於各該害病的人，怎麼是好？據作者臆測，將來衛生發達到極點，不但各地飯館裏的廚師們要時時受公家的郵子檢騐，就是人家用的廚師，也要在保單上添到一項某某「大醫師」簽字證明那人不是任何病郵，大家才敢聘用，傭工介紹所裏，也許須得仿照歐美各國屠宰場裏的檢騐肉類，由公家聘請專家，駐所檢騐菌郵，在健康證書上簽字作證，才有人敢用哩！現在招用廚師或傭僕，至少也須問明他近來有沒有害過霍亂，腸熱，痢疾，白喉，肺炎，腦脊髓熱等等病症，要揀選他沒有病過的，才可收用，免得誤用病後的自動郵子啦（就只對那些被動郵子，還想不出好辦法）。</p>
<p>南京健康教育委員會去年曾經辦過學校廚師訓練班，希望這種委員會能擴大他們底事權，管理到民眾的健康教育，多辦幾個一般的廚師，飯頭，或是主婦治膳訓練班，各地也仿着去做。</p>
<p>又南京市衛生事務所好像建立過一什麼模範廚房。如果確實認為簡便適用，可以推行全國的話，也希望能把這種模範廚房底內容宣佈出來，好給大家跟着仿造，或是觀摩一些對於廚房應有的概念。</p>
<h3>浙江硤石衛生狀況調查報告（一）</h3>
<p>— 沈松年</p>
<p>硤石雖屬蕞爾小鎮，然以地處滬杭路要道，水陸交通　　風氣開通甚早，鎮人莫不習尙摩登，生活奢侈樸素合璧，唯民智甚為低落，種種衛生設施，不能如期實現，此甚遺憾耳。連年當局不斷地努力的結果，略已精具規模，較之偏僻農村，雖可唯我獨尊，然與大都會相較，實還相差很遠！——這當然是有極大的病態，有乎其中，不能全然怪衛生當局的不力，簡直是巧婦難為無米之炊呵，然而教育界與我們醫藥界也應負起相當的責任，那是無可推諉的。茲以管見所及的硤地衛生概況，歸納數點於後，算作衛生當局應該改進的參考也可：</p>
<p>（甲）有關醫政</p>
<p>（一）市河淤塞</p>
<p>硤地市面尚未繁華到有設自來水廠的咨格，市心居民所需要飲料，全賴市河供給，雖有公井之設立，究因杯水車薪，一到炎夏河水淺涸，甚至水內醱酵而放臭，行人掩鼻，為一切病菌大本營，有礙衛生，無甚逾此，故宜設法通　，因非特對民眾飲水有關，仰且有礙火政　近聞當地士紳暨消防隊隊長吳欣木氏等特召集會議，商討通　進行計劃，設能如期實現，洵一莫大德政，造神人羣匪淺。</p>
<p>（二）上水道的不清潔</p>
<p>塘橋外塘河，為市河水源，是以塘河中的不改善，有礙市河水質，民眾生命安健，如時有花蕾發現，汚臭彌天，最為疫癘盛行的主因，希當局隨時飭衛生警嚴密澈查，如有發現，即應嚴癘消　，　法　　一事實上場所，並嚴查戶　，鄭重處罰，以懲效尤，以維衛生，　重民命。</p>
<p>（三）公廁之不普遍</p>
<p>往往許多地方，居民不知衛生，知識低落，隨便設置不合衛生的廁所，甚至露天糞坑，實屬有礙民眾健康頗鉅，因廁所中瓦斯氣，足以病倒健全者，而疫癘的唯一媒介老爺——蚊蠅之類——最喜　集於該汚穢，然後再為病菌義務帶到飲食品中，貽悮人類，所以衛生當局，曾三申五令，嚴格取締。可是事實上單單實行消極辦法，沒有積極的普遍公廁，恰弊端百出。如不衛生的廁所，雖已取締，沒知識者，仍視若無睹，反而變本加厲，隨地亂撒，致糞尿狼藉，如橋　及弄堂之處，即其例也。</p>
<p>（四）臭水浜的不清除</p>
<p>凡曾經到過硤石的，都知道這裏的沙泗浜（俗稱垃圾浜，浜名垃圾，其汚穢程度可知）是著名的臭水浜，是疫病最好的製造廠，居民沒公德，不識注重公共衛生，甚至有些人家，索性把垃圾傾入浜中，與洗滌便桶，於是浜水愈形淤淺，水質益形混濁，一到炎夏，蚊蠅麕集浜水醱酵昇華，臭氣沖天，足以助成疫癘的猖獗。希衛生當局亟宜設法清除。消極的辦法，通令居民，不得隨意傾入垃圾於浜內，一面隨時洒入消毒藥水。積極的辦法，反正浜水不能為民眾實用，際此經費籌措困難的不景氣潮流中，無力加以改善，索性把牠填平之，然後加以標賣，所得經費，盡充地方上公共衛生建設之用，為人羣謀福利。</p>
<p>（五）居民人數</p>
<p>全縣約三十五萬餘人，本鎮佔全縣人口七分之一強。（待續）</p>
<h3>公共衛生護士之重要</h3>
<p>— 紀景壽</p>
<p>中國近年醫事衛生建設之發展，突飛猛進，確有一日千里之趨勢：夫衛生建設事業之發達，足可減少疾病率死亡率，且能促進人民之健康，延長人民之壽命，增加工作之能力，娛樂之身心，以及國家在國際地位之提高，是亦不能否認之事實。能夠負責來推進與發展此項醫事衛生建設事業之人員，為公共衛生醫師，護士，助產士，衛生稽查等醫事人員；而其中尤以公共衛生護生為推進此項工作之主要工具，原動力，能夠深入民間作最下層工作者也，僅有公共衛生護士。無論繁華的都市，偏僻的窮鄉，學校，家庭，機關，以及工廠等地，均有公共衛生護士之足跡；尤其在窮鄉僻地，請不起醫師的地方，而公共衛生護士能以極低的薪金代價，埋頭努力在苦斡。</p>
<p>（一）宣傳及灌輸民眾醫藥衛生常識，疾病之原理，保持健康之方法，與如何預防傳染病。</p>
<p>（二）使已病者受適當治療與護理，以期獲得痊愈及恢復身心健康。</p>
<p>（三）積極與地方上各醫藥衛生機關，及其他社會服務團體取得聯絡與合作。</p>
<p>（四）恊助人民　置有礙健康之各項問題。</p>
<p>一地衛生事業發達與否，可以說完全　乎在公共衛生護士是否有才幹，是否努力工作，是否能教導人民，是否肯與他人合作。是以公共衛生護士工作與衛生事業的發達，民眾之健康，國家之強盛，民族之與衰，都有極大之關係。</p>
<p>公共衛生護士工作既如上述之切要，其使命又極光明，因之公共衛生護士在現代醫事衛生建設事業中，確實已佔有基礎之地位。的確公共衛生護士實為負責努力推進現代醫事衛生建設事業之生力軍，先鋒隊。</p>

<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（九十二）痛風（上）</p>
<p>（問）什麼呌做痛風？</p>
<p>（答）痛風是身體　內尿酸蓄積不能從房　中排出而起的疾病。臨症上在各處關節內起　一種炎症狀態。</p>
<p>（問）病風的病名，而又是什麼？</p>
<p>（答）英文呌Gout，德文呌Gicht，拉丁學名實在呌做尿酸性關節炎（Arthrirs　Urica）</p>
<p>（問）痛風的原因何在？</p>
<p>（答）痛風的原因，體質方面和遺傳有關係。在有尿酸素質的家族系，往往容易患痛風症。在自己身體方面，凡肉食過多，嗜飲的人，也容易得這種病。所以富裕人比貧民多些。</p>
<p>（問）痛風和年　齡性別有關係嗎？</p>
<p>（答）男子比女　子為多；三十歲到五十歲　是發病的年齡。</p>
<p>（問）痛風的病狀　是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）痛風是發作　性的疾病，有急性發　作病狀和慢性病狀的區別。</p>
<p>（問）急性發作的　病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）是突然發作的，但大槪先有消　化不良，全身倦怠，精神沉鬱等前驅症狀。其他有牽引性疼痛，腓腸肌痙等，也有發熱的。</p>
<p>（問）到了發作　的時候，現什麼病狀？</p>
<p>（答）大都在夜　間或早晚開始發作。先在一足拇指的足趾關節起非常的劇痛，這呌做足痛風。這種疼痛很强烈，不耐稍微的壓迫。患病的關節，發紅腫脹，有熱感。這種痛風發作從夜間到早晨為止，漸漸緩和。然關節腫脹並不完全消退，到朋天晚上仍舊再發。這樣要經過半星期。</p>
<p>（問）痛風是不　是一度發作後就算完了的？</p>
<p>（答）不是，大槪隔了數星期或數日再　要反覆一度或數度的。</p>
<p>（問）痛風的侵襲，除了足趾以外，還有別的部分嗎？</p>
<p>（答）後來漸漸　侵犯到拇趾以外的關節，像跗骨關節，跺關節，膝關節等處。也有侵犯上肢關節手關節，小指關節。凡四肢骨的末梢關節都容易被侵犯的。</p>
<p>（問）痛風除了在小　關節之外，可以侵犯大關節嗎？</p>
<p>（答）大關節也　有被侵犯的，像跨關節和肩關節都等有發作的可能。</p>
<p>（問）屢决發作痛　風之後，關節要起什　麼異狀？</p>
<p>（答）有起關　節畸形的事情，也有變為慢性痛風的。（未完）</p>
<h3>國產之藥用植物（續）</h3>
<p>— 周蒙白</p>
<p>六薄荷Mentha　arvensis，L.var.piperascens，Holmes.</p>
<p>（植物）自生於原野，路傍卑濕之地，可以栽培，多年草也。全株密布短毛。葉對生，短柄，作長橢圓形，邊緣有鋸齒，其端尖銳。由葉腋生短柄之輸織花序，夏秋之候，開淡紫色小唇形花。瘦果作小卵形。</p>
<p>（栽培法）十一月下旬整地，旱田每畦作二尺五寸而栽植其地下莖。若為水田，每畦八尺闊，應稍高，分二行栽培。肥料用豆粕，人糞尿，人造肥料等。收穫期，我國為六月下旬，八月中旬，十月中旬三次。每畝收乾草約二百五十斤。將乾草以水蒸氣蒸餾，可製造薄荷油。其收量為乾草之0.8-1.8％。含油率，第二次收割者最多，第一次收割者最少。</p>
<p>（生藥）薄荷葉Folium　Menthae，係採集其葉而乾燥之者也。本品作卵圓形或披針形，長約三——七公分，不齊鋸齒綠，其端尖銳。葉面散生毛茸。有特異之芳香氣味，性淸凉。</p>
<p>（成分）全草中含有1％內外之精油。精油中總Menthol　CilH2oO含量為70-90％（遊離Menthol　65-85％Ester　3-8％），其他為Menthon　CioHi8O　Menthenon-3　CilHi60　I-Limonen　3.4　Hexenolphenylacetat　C2H5-CH=CHCH2-CH2-O-CO-CH2-C6H5　Aethyln-amylkston　C2H5COC5H11等。</p>
<p>（藥用）全草以水蒸氣蒸餾，可製造薄荷油，更由此可製造薄荷腦Mentholum（局方）。薄荷腦可用以矯味矯臭。又薄荷腦及薄荷油，製造牙粉及糖果點心中，有多量之消費。</p>
<p>日本所產之薄荷油，以Monthol含量多，是其優點，但稍有苦味，芳香亦不及歐美所產者，故日本產薄荷油以之作Menthol製造原料用為主，點心糖果中，則用歐美所產者。就中以英國Mitcham所產之Mitcham　oil為最佳，香味均優，為人重視。</p>
<h3>住院療養每日費洋三分</h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>黃金國醫藥統制之成功　國人之健康保障為如何</p>
<p>每日費洋三分，可得三星期或更長之免費住院療養，睹君願付此少數之金錢，而得避去一年家庭預算外之鉅大支出乎？現時美國有五十萬人，加入疾病保險，此項疾病保險事業，現正日趨普及，每月新會員之加入者，數逾萬人。</p>
<p>茲舉一例，如紐約醫院服務保險公司Associated　Hospital　Serviceof　N.Y.之第十萬號會員某君，乃一完全健康者，但此君如忽患病而須住院治療，（大約每十人中有一人須住院療治，）則以平日所付極少之會費，此時卽可免費在一百卅七城市醫院中擇一兩人同房之病房住療廿一日，苟須繼續住療時，仍得享七五折之優待利益。</p>
<p>紐約城之保險費，為廿四大規模之「醫院保險公司」（或卽疾病保險公司）之模範，如克立夫蘭及勃明瀚兩域之最低保費為每月六角，路傑司脫則為六角五分，而在煞克曼土及紐奧蘭則為七角五分。</p>
<p>醫院對於　等保險公司送來之病人，收費如下：</p>
<p>住一日者收費　十五元</p>
<p>住二日者收費　二十元</p>
<p>住三日者收費　二十三元</p>
<p>自第四日起，每日收費六元五角。</p>
<p>醫院對於此等病人，極表歡迎，因免費病人可因此而减少。醫生雖對於此類醫院收入，並無特別利益，而對於此種保險病人，仍表示歡迎。因病人旣可不必担負醫院費用，則對於醫生診費，自然易於籌措也。</p>
<p>塔克散司城Baylor大學之金堡博士，為疾病保險之最先創始者，在一九一九年時，彼為一千二百五十學校敎員保險，保費為每人每月五角，因試騐成功，故疾病保險事業，遂為一般人所注意。</p>
<p>六年後，卽一九三五年，紐約城有芬玲赫司脫小姐，聯合數公寓職員，開始此項事業，一年內會員總數卽達八萬四千人，至今日已逾十萬〇七千人，而每月新會員之加入者，的五千人。最奇者，此事始終未藉廣吿之宣傳，而其保險事業，乃竟不脛而走也。</p>
<p>金堡博士之原來設備，對於現在之一萬八千會員，已感不敷，故現已在塔克散司城內籌設新醫院兩所，尙有數處，亦在籌備中。（待續）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>豐台事件怎樣解決</h3>
<p>— 芳</p>
<p>十九日報載，豐台中日兩軍，忽然發生衝突，馮治安部被包圍，某連長被據，砲聲突起，雙方正在相持中，我看見了這個消息，很有些吃驚，以為這樣很嚴重的事伴，一定要比成都北海兩事件，還要嚴重，或者竟至擴大，繼「九一八」「一二八」兩役而創造第三次的新記錄，亦不可知。</p>
<p>所以對於二十日的報張，盼望十分熱切，想經過一宵之後這事的演變，不知到了怎樣嚴重的程度？豈知到了二十日淸晨，打兩報紙一看，便是大書特書，豐台事伴業已平穩解决，互釋誤會，某連長亦已釋回，這樣嚴重的問題，竟不到二十四小時，巳渙然泳釋，和好如初，這不是在我人眼目中是喜出望外的一件事？</p>
<p>天然我們抉不希望此種不幸事件之形勢擴大，與時間延長，苟其互釋誤會，連長敖　，雖不能說我們交　的勝利，　至少也抓了一些面子回來，但我不知此次不幸　件解决的迅速　其原因何在？是否冀　當局的　於　　。而交涉得手呢？還是日方的格外退步，息事寗人，而馬虎了事？究底怎樣了結一筆壞賬，實在難以索解。</p>
<p>又據某報津訊，自日本華北駐屯軍强化後豐台地方，迭起糾紛，我駐防該地的軍士，乃時感壓迫，不料十八日午後五時，有日軍一部，在豐台演習，擬由我駐軍營盤穿過，我軍當加阻　，日軍不聽，遂起衝突，這事件的起因，是否如某報所載，尙不可知，大約是不會盡虛的。豐臺為我國在華北重要的領土，以我國的領土，而駐紥我國的軍隊，竟至發生這樣嚴重的後果，異成什麼世界？若照這樣看來，豐臺事件，怎樣的解決，幷且怎樣的平穩解決，我不能無疑，假定解决此事，而能根據不失主權，不喪士地兩種原則上，和平過去，原是萬幸，倘一切不顧，完全屈服，完全遵從對方的意志，和平過去，這種解決，還是不解决為愈，我甚希望和平，酷愛和平，然和平有和平的限度，有和平的說法，故孔子日，知和而和，不以禮節之，亦不可行，我更改變其說曰，知和而和，而忘國家之利害，斷不可行。</p>
<p>我方寫好此文，便見昨日的報紙，據說豐台我駐軍盡撤，移駐豐台南趙家莊云云，果如此，則中日軍衝突地，則我軍徹退一地，衝突十地，則我軍撤退十地，我不知我國有多少豐台可以徹？有多少趙家莊可以駐？這也算是和平解决，眞是余欲無言。</p>
<h3>木凟保節局訪問記（上）</h3>
<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>（本報特寫）節婦在古時是為聖人所歌頌，帝王所褒獎的，所以到現在還可以在各處見到許多貞節牌坊，節烈祠等存在着；而且，那些貞節牌坊和節烈祠上面，都嵌鑲着一塊聖旨或憲旨，在當時，這光榮偉大是可以想見的了。但就在這光榮偉大的遺毒下，一直至今，正不知壓死了多少無辜的女子，更不知有若干女子把自己的畢生幸福輕輕地斷送了！</p>
<p>貞操被一般男子視為私有物，而只有女子有負守貞守節的義務之我國，過去，甚至於現在，不獨男人有强迫女人守貞守節的權利，卽是一般女子也甘心度此未亡人的悽凉生涯。</p>
<p>淸節堂，安節局，保節局等這一類鼓勵貞節的機關，於是便在那些聖人賢者，和慈善家們歌頌貞節的環境下出現了；在吃人的舊禮敎勢力仍然非常濃厚的我國內地，像這種畸形的現象依舊是十分普遍。並且那班紳士老爺們，自己縱然娶上四五位姨太太，却名正言順的不許他的妻女去敗壤他的門楣（？），因此，貞節的褒揚，在他們覺得無論如何是不能廢止的。</p>
<p>蘇州的安節局，從前我也會去參觀過，但它現在已歸併於婦孺救濟院了；如今碩果僅存的，只是木凟還有一個保節局。</p>
<p>保節局，這顯名思義，我們可以知道它是一個保護貞節的機關。我昨天為了乘到蘇州去之便，特地到該局里去訪問了一次。</p>
<p>該局創立於前淸光綫二一一二年間，至今，的莫巳有四十來年的光景，創辦者為邑入馮培之。——據說馮培之當時係江蘇道台衙門的司庫，而在庫房里値事的就是他的妻弟，有一次其妻弟忽侵吞庫銀巨萬，馮發覺後恐累國法，遂移欵創此保節局；於是一筆缺額就借此向上司報銷。所以，該保節局到現在還是為　性防　。</p>
<p>我　進了牆門，個看　中　　着一塊「保節局」的匾額，穿過了一個大天井，就是一個很大的廳堂。天井兩傍有兩株木樨花樹，一陣陣的桂花香是直向鼻竅里鑽了進去；廳的中央是關公像，傍邊有一副馮氏親筆的木對，我現在只記得下聯一句「侵吞堂欵男盜女娼」，這也許是表明自己，也許是警誡別人的吧。</p>
<p>再經過一個天井，那里又是一個小廳，辦事處和接待室也就在這見。壁上掛着一塊寫着節婦花名和大小人口的牌子，用式操柏舟等頌讚貞節的句子編着各貞婦的號頭。</p>
<p>一連闖了三四進坪子，靜悄悄地，不會碰到過一個人，這使我有點懷疑，疑心自家兒跑進了一座冷廟或祠堂里來了。但我終於鼓着勇氣，像一個探險家似的向着裏面繼續闖去，並且轉彎抹角的，　問了答處虛掩着的門　　　只　望遇到一個人　　以便　　　話。</p>
<p>直到推進了最後的一扇門，纔聽得裏面有談話的聲音，我尋着聲音走去，便看見有幾個老婦人在那里工作着。</p>
<p>這里有六七十間丈來見方的平屋，屋前都有一埭狹狹的矮廊，每一間里都住着一個節婦，和節婦的兒女，屋里除了一隻床外，還堆積着許多用具，而每間廊　的矮平盤上全有一隻泥爐子，是節婦們自己燒菜煮食物的。從那兒一直進去是一個佛堂，但這佛堂也正和外面的情形一樣，顯得非常凌亂頹敗。這時佛堂里有七八個節婦在刺繡，她們見了我這不速之客覺得十分驚異，但却沒有一個人來向我詢問，她們對我望了一望之後　仍舊埋首去理她們的針線了。</p>
<h3>路</h3>
<p>— 李因非</p>
<p>和朋友倆從酒店出來已經深夜二點多　了，初秋的風吹上身來，怪爽快的，馬路上一片的靜，交　　　　了過去</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>，巡捕靠在電桿木上，無精打彩的，黃包車夫怕吵醒入們似的，悄悄地跑了過去。為了貪看這秋之街道的夜景，黃包車夫拉了車杠兜上來，我袛用搖頭來回答我還不想馬上回家去，雖然我的脚是向回家的路上跑的。</p>
<p>有一輛包車在我身旁擦過，我毫不經意，因為經騐吿訴我，這時該正是舞女帶了酸麻的腿回家的時候。但忽然有一個淸脆的聲音在我耳邊飄了起來：「哈囉！」</p>
<p>「哈囉」，像是空谷的回音，我也習慣地回答了一聲？但當我抬起頭來看，却祇看見一個背影，在黯淡的光綫下，我認不出那是誰的背影。</p>
<p>我的腦子裏過電似的念頭，差不多是等於沒有思索，我向遠遠的一輛黃包車招了招手，把它喊了過來。</p>
<p>黃包車夫狡猾地朝我笑笑，我沒理他，祇把手指向前面點了一點：「追上去！快點！」</p>
<p>漸漸地追近了，我還想不起那是誰的背影。但是看看她們的所謂「飛機頭髪」，又是坐着兩個人，這時候又正是舞塲打烊的辰光，……我祇能笨拙地又喊了聲：「哈囉」！</p>
<p>隨了喊聲有一個回過頭來了，另外一個却更把頭低下去，那回過頭來的是個陌生的臉。</p>
<p>我吩咐黃包車再加快些，追過了她們，我回過頭來看，看見那個把頭低下去的是有着濃黑的睫毛和大的眼珠的臉。——那張熱悉的然而記不起來是什麼地方見過的臉。</p>
<p>但終於我可記起來了：「哦，是你，素月！」</p>
<p>「回家嗎？怎麼這麼晚還一個人走回去。」</p>
<p>「一同去喫點東西好不好，我有許多話要同你談呢。」</p>
<p>「太晚了」，她頓了頓，「也好。」</p>
<p>於是我們到了一家廣東館子裏。</p>
<p>剛坐定，那個姓周的舞女機警地又站了起來：「瑪琍，我的頭痛得很，我先回去了。」</p>
<p>我知道這是怎麼頑意見，便向她笑了笑說：「周小姐，請你不要把意思誤會了，我們祇是通去的同學。」</p>
<p>「難道現在不是嗎？」那個姓周的笑了笑，我明白那笑裏是有深意的。</p>
<p>「自然不是了，現在我是舞女，他是少爺。我們走着極端的路呢！」</p>
<p>「素月，你不要在字面上故意去曲解好不好？」</p>
<p>「我現在呌瑪琍！」</p>
<p>「瑪琍不還是素月嗎？」</p>
<p>她好像沒有聽見我的話，突然的問：「近來的生活好不好？結了婚了吧？」</p>
<p>「是的，結了婚了。你呢？」</p>
<p>「也結過婚了，並且有着一個孩子，不過已離了，孩子却還活着，在我身邊。」說得很倔强。</p>
<p>「現在在那家做呢？」</p>
<p>「我不願意你來跟我跳舞，再說，過幾天我要到香港去了，上海的生意很不好，熟人又多。」</p>
<p>「難道不願意見我嗎？為了過去的友誼，我想我多少總能帮你一點忙的。」</p>
<p>「謝謝你，我現在很好。」</p>
<p>接着，我們談了一些過去，我想用過去來請她相信我的確是願意帮她忙的，但是這些都沒有用，她好像不理解似的。祇是說了些不關痛癢的話。</p>
<p>第二天，我跑遍上海的舞塲，都沒找到她，祇遇見那個姓周的，那個姓風的也不肯脫出她住的地方。過幾天我又到那邊去，那位周小姐給我一張孛條，並且說：「瑪琍昨天已經動身到香港去了，這張字條是早寫好的，因為她關照過等她離開上海才交給你，所以保留到現在。」</p>
<p>我沒有看便把它撕了，因為我知道她將會說些什麼話。</p>
<p>我們走着極端的路嗎？</p>

<h3>煥然一新的金城</h3>
<p>第一砲准映「女權」</p>
<p>北京路金城大戲院，自與工修理以來，瞬屆一月。現已全部竣工，院內院外，煥然一新。第一部公映的影片，並已選定胡　主演的「女權」，茲將關於該院情形，簡略的寫一點在下面：</p>
<p>該院內外墻壁，均已油漆一新，粉妝玉琢，金鑲銀嵌，煇煌富麗，如入皇宮，而各處的壁燈戀燈，亦已換裝新式電炬，柔雅宜人，不染塵俗。院內座位，幾近二千，為滬上放映國片座位最多的戲院，現亦全部重加沒漆，軟墊綢套，舒適無比。</p>
<p>該院銀幕上的光　，凡是國產影片的老看各，是沒有一個不稱讚的，今更更換燈箱機件，較並越加明晣，而有聲部份，亦復掉換　　伊康最新式的有聲機件，不但發音洪大，亦且非常準確，較原音無大差異。銀幕不僅橡皮製成，且尺寸的廣大，亦為其他影院所不及。</p>
<h3>「女權」一幕</h3>
<p>「女權」影片，係明星公司本年度一部最偉大的出品，為胡蝶女士婚後的第一次傑作，述一智識女子在惡劣環境中奮　的情形，可歌可泣，不同凡響。導演係張石川，編劇係洪深，自開場以至終場，差不多幕幕有胡蝶的戲，這更是非常難得的了。</p>
<p>繼「女權」後將在該院開映的，尙有新華公司出品，吏東山先生把「欽差大臣」改編的「狂歡之花」，這也是本年度國產影壇上的一個驚人收獲。此外尚朋程步高導演，談瑛主演的「小玲子」，這個片子的成績優越，竟出乎吾人意料之外，凡是看過試片的人，也許沒有一個不讚美的吧。</p>
<p>總之，金城主人一意要將該院建成一座最高尙富麗的戲院，成為國人一處最滿意的娛樂場所，故不但設備方面，力求精美，而對於管理種種，亦莫不力求革新云。</p>
<h3>民新製片消息</h3>
<p>民新公司第一次出品金擎宇編導之「母愛」，係全部有聲對白片，由林楚楚，黎鏗，葛佐治，胡藝星，趙華，宋小蝶，洪　鈴，黃筠貞，　智華，費柏青，溫容等合演，現已全部竣事，成績異常圓滿，最近將在上海金城大戲院公演。</p>
<p>人道，城市之夜，人生，天倫作者，名編劇家鐘石棍，即將自己導演其新作「靈肉之門」，並由趙策聯合導演，劇本業已送京審查，通過即將開拍，作為民新公司第二號出品。</p>
<p>民新之「第三號出品」，劇本早已決定，現正積極籌備中，一俟劇本通過，或將與「靈肉之門」同時開拍，屆時民新攝影場上，必有一番空前盛况，預計最遲於年內，兩片可同時定成。</p>

<h3>Serious Situation Arising from the Hankou Incident; Japanese Leaders Confer Daily; Decide to Adopt a Tough Stance; New Instructions to be Issued to Ambassador Kawagoe; Demand China Suppress Anti-Japanese Sentiment; and Prepare to Dispatch Additional Troops to China; Foreign Ministry Said to Be Drafting Concrete Policies</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Although yesterday, the 20th, was a Sunday, the leaders of the three services (Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministry) separately convened meetings to discuss the situation arising from the new incident in Hankou. It is expected that new instructions will soon be issued to Ambassador Kawagoe, adopting a tough stance. This afternoon, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson answered various questions from foreign reporters. The gist of his remarks can be summarized as follows: Regarding the Hankou incident, China and Japan are currently jointly arresting the perpetrators and investigating the background of the case. The incident appears to be a planned action, but it cannot be confirmed until the true background is clarified. In any case, the incident is similar to the Chengdu and Beihai incidents and is a consequence of the easily ignited anti-Japanese sentiment. Therefore, in the political aspect, Japan will combine the Hankou incident with the Chengdu and Beihai incidents to more resolutely demand that the Chinese authorities completely suppress anti-Japanese sentiment and adjust relations between the two countries. Ambassador Kawagoe's negotiations in Nanjing will continue because the negotiations have only just begun and will not be interrupted by the new incident. Furthermore, the reports in newspapers that Japan is currently setting a deadline for the investigation of the Beihai incident are inaccurate. China has asked Japan to wait while it dispatches central troops to replace Weng Zhaoyuan's troops. (Central News Agency telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to an announcement here today, the Japanese Emperor has approved the Navy Ministry's request to dispatch additional troops to China to reinforce the naval landing forces. The strength of these reinforcements has not yet been announced. It is rumored that the dispatch of these fresh troops is a result of the Japanese Navy authorities' decision to maintain a permanently stationed naval landing force in Hankou after the murder of Japanese consular police last Saturday. Yesterday, a batch of landing forces departed Shanghai on two destroyers for Hankou, but they will be withdrawn once the reinforcements arriving from Japan arrive. The above action has been explained today by the Navy Ministry in a public announcement. The Japanese Navy authorities have decided to form another special naval landing force to be dispatched to China to reinforce the elements of the Third Fleet currently stationed there. (Reuters telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, when meeting with newspaper reporters today, while stating that the situation between China and Japan is very serious, believes that most of the newspapers' speculations about possible demands Japan might make on China are based on imagination. The spokesperson neither confirmed nor denied the rumored possibility of creating a buffer zone in North China, only saying that the issue is worthy of study and has been discussed by China and Japan in the past two years. At the same time, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, Navy Minister Nagano, and Army Minister Terauchi held a meeting today to discuss the specific policies regarding the Chinese situation drafted by the Foreign Ministry personnel during a five-hour meeting yesterday. (Reuters telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Yesterday, Foreign Ministry personnel, after a five-hour meeting, drafted a concrete policy on the Chinese situation and will submit it to today's meeting of the Foreign Minister, Navy Minister, and Army Minister. According to the Yomiuri Shimbun, the Foreign Ministry's proposals are as follows: (1) Create a buffer zone including the five provinces of Hebei, Chahar, Shandong, Shanxi, and Suiyuan. The Nanjing government would still retain its territorial sovereignty over these provinces, but all other rights and obligations, such as the appointment and removal of officials, the collection of taxes, and military administration, would have to be transferred to local autonomous governments. (2) Take advantage of the current opportunity to resolve the joint transportation contract between China and Japan, the most notable of which is the aviation issue. (3) China should fundamentally revise the tariffs imposed on Japanese goods after the September 18th Incident. (4) China should employ as many Japanese advisors as possible. (Reuters telegram, 21st) (Note: This statement has not been confirmed by sources related to China.)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Navy Ministry authorities convened a leadership meeting this morning. Navy Minister Nagano, Vice-Minister Hasegawa, and Military Affairs Bureau Chief Toyoda attended and held comprehensive and important discussions on the Hankou, Beihai, and Chengdu incidents, discussing concrete countermeasures independently from the Navy's perspective, and agreeing to discuss in detail matters such as the Hankou and Beihai incidents and increasing alert capabilities. (China United News Agency telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry, Navy Ministry, Army Ministry, and Finance Ministry authorities held a joint meeting at 1 p.m. today to discuss the Chengdu, Beihai, and recent incidents in North China and Hankou. The authorities from each ministry provided their respective resolutions, and concrete decisions were made regarding the above incidents. The situation was extremely tense, and the meeting adjourned around 3 p.m. (China United News Agency telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Navy Minister Nagano convened an important leadership meeting this morning, focusing on the resolutions of yesterday's joint meeting of the military administration and military command departments, and continued to discuss concrete countermeasures for the Beihai and Hankou incidents. As a result, it was decided to increase the special landing forces. (China United News Agency telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita, Vice-Minister Horiuchi, Director of the East Asia Bureau Kuwashima, Chief of the First Section of the East Asia Bureau Kamimura, and other relevant staff held an important meeting at the Foreign Minister's official residence yesterday (the 20th) to discuss concrete countermeasures for the Chengdu, Beihai, Hankou, and North China incidents, lasting as long as five hours. As a result, important resolutions were made. (China United News Agency telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>No Progress in Investigation of the Yoshioka Case; Japanese Warships Sail from Shanghai; Landing Forces Arm and Land at Night; Chinese Military Police Assist Japanese Investigation</h3>
<p>(Hankou) It is reported that the investigation of the Yoshioka case has made no progress. The Japanese Concession's heightened security measures eased slightly on the morning of the 21st. Electric wire barricades were moved to the sides of the streets, and general searches of pedestrians were halted. Naval landing forces also returned to their ships, but they still landed armed at night to enforce martial law. Since the case occurred within the Japanese Concession, further investigation of the case will still rely on the efforts of the Japanese authorities. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Hankou) After the shooting of Japanese police officer Yoshioka at the entrance of Dazheng Street, near the Nisshin Pier, in the Japanese Concession of Hankou at 11:30 a.m. on the 19th of this month, although the incident occurred within the Japanese Concession, our authorities are also paying unusual attention to the case. In order to promote friendly relations between China and Japan and assist in the investigation, the Hubei Pacification Commissioner's Office and the Hubei Provincial Government jointly ordered the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, the Hankou Municipal Government, and the two Wuhan Public Security Bureaus on the night of the 20th to instruct their subordinates to conduct a census and inspect suspicious individuals starting immediately. It is reported that the above-mentioned agencies, upon receiving the order, have complied and notified their subordinates. It is said that this action by our government is entirely a voluntary expression of sincerity in assisting the Japanese side. Furthermore, after Yoshioka's death, the Hankou Public Security Bureau recently identified several important eyewitnesses near the scene of the incident. On the 21st, the Municipal Government notified the Japanese side, requesting that they send personnel to the Municipal Public Security Bureau at 3 p.m. on the 22nd to jointly question them with our personnel about everything. (Central News Agency telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Hankou) A batch of Japanese landing forces will arrive here tomorrow from Shanghai on the destroyers "Uzuki" and "Kotaka." The arrival of these troops in Hankou is due to the killing of Japanese consular police officer Yoshioka last Saturday. Although the exact strength is not announced, it is believed that the number will not be small. At the same time, China and Japan are continuing to investigate the Yoshioka murder case. Once completed, a formal statement will be released. There are no new developments regarding this case today. (Reuters telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Miura, the Japanese Consul General in Hankou, demanded the arrest of the murderer from Wu Guozhen, the Mayor of Hankou, this morning. (China United News Agency telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Two days and nights have passed since the assassination of patrolman Yoshioka. Consul General Miura and other staff members of the consulate and police station, as well as land and naval authorities, have been working tirelessly, continuing to investigate the truth. Yesterday, a field survey was conducted jointly by the Chinese and Japanese authorities. (Domei News Agency telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The landing force of 〇〇〇 men specially dispatched from Shanghai will arrive in Hankou at dusk on the 22nd. After arriving in Hankou, they will jointly protect the overseas Chinese with the warships Ataka and Hotaka, which are currently guarding Hankou. It has also been decided that the dispatched troops will be stationed in the halls of the Dazheng Building and the elementary school building in the Japanese Concession.

<h3>Prerequisites for Adjusting Chinese-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>Since the Chengdu and Beihai cases occurred, there has been no sign of a speedy resolution. Following them, there was the alarm of a misunderstanding and conflict between Chinese and Japanese troops in Fengtai. Then came the shocking news of the assassination of Japanese police officer Kioka Teijiro in the Japanese concession in Hankou. There was the false alarm of explosives found in the kitchen of the Hiroshiyo Trading Company, a Japanese firm in Shantou. When Mount Tong collapses in the east, the bells ring in the west. Strange situations and crafty behaviors appear together in confusion. These days can truly be called a troubled autumn. At a time when the call for adjusting Chinese-Japanese relations is at its highest, and when Zhang Qun and Kawagoe are engaged in diplomatic negotiations, such bizarre and bewildering incidents are repeatedly occurring. Isn't it truly regrettable? Isn't it also deeply astonishing? In this situation, how can we not pay close attention?</p>
<p>Among these three cases, the Fengtai dispute is the one with the most obvious facts. However, on the question of who provoked the initial conflict, each side still holds its own version. As for the Hankou and Shantou incidents, they are both groundless suspicions. The so-called bombs planted by Chinese were merely the unilateral conjecture of the Japanese consul. And whether or not Yoshioka's assassination was carried out by Chinese has not yet been definitively proven. Moreover, when the incidents occur, our side strives to be tolerant and carefully record the events, using a tactful attitude to avoid</p>

The troops sent by Guangdong Province to take over the defense have arrived at the designated location, and the investigators are also waiting quietly on the gunboat these days. Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi have telegraphed Weng Zhaoyuan, urging him to shorten the withdrawal time as much as possible. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>

<h3>A Certain Country Sends Personnel to Qinghai to Secretly Agitate the Asian Prince; Sets Up a Special Agent Agency in the Huit Banner</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) A certain country's Kwantung Army Command has secretly sent personnel to Qinghai to agitate the Asian Prince. They have also united the pseudo-organization in eastern Suiyuan with the princes and nobles of the Mongolian banners of Ningxia and Suiyuan. Firearms and cannons are being sold cheaply by a certain country. This country has also set up a special agent agency in the Huit Banner to assist in the operation.

However, the recruited masses are disheveled and look like beggars. Even if they are driven to the front line, they cannot fight. However, the residents of Shangdu are suffering unbearably from their depredations. (Central News Agency telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>The Number of Japanese Garrison Troops in North China Totals Over 14,000; A Total of 4,000 Stationed in Beiping</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) According to recent reliable investigations, the number of Japanese garrison troops in various places in Beiping and Tianjin is as follows: A total of 2,825 stationed at the Haiguang Temple in Tianjin, 1,600 stationed at Dongjuzi, a total of 4,000 stationed in Beiping, 2,000 stationed in Fengtai, 700 stationed in Tongzhou, 800 stationed in Shanhaiguan, 500 stationed in Qinhuangdao, 500 stationed in Nandasi, 400 stationed in Tangshan, 500 stationed in Tanggu, 300 stationed in Changli, 300 stationed in Luanxian, and other garrisons along the Beining Railway and at the Liushouying camp, with varying numbers of 170-180 soldiers per location. The garrison troops in all the above locations have adopted wartime organization. The four locations of Beiping, Tianjin, Fengtai, and Tangshan are equipped with motorized and chemical warfare units, making their strength even more formidable. enlarging the situation. The Japanese side, relying on their arrogance, exaggerates their words, and does not hesitate to use tough methods to create a serious situation. Even though the location of Yoshioka's murder was clearly at his post, the spokesperson even suggested that there might have been a possibility of moving the body to destroy evidence. The intention behind this is even harder to understand. Now, the Fengtai incident has been resolved. Our troops stationed in Fengtai have withdrawn to the Zhao Zhuang area. The true intentions are now fully exposed. In order to express our sincerity, we have done our utmost to make concessions. How will the Japanese, who loudly proclaim the theory of cooperation, declare their sincerity?</p>
<p>In all fairness, taking Chinese-Japanese cooperation as a slogan is originally something we also desire. However, judging from the current situation, it is hard to avoid the feeling of going in the opposite direction. Regardless of the background of the various unfortunate incidents, they are all ultimately the result of suspicion and conjecture. And in every incident, the severe measures adopted by the Japanese, their exaggerated propaganda, and their ultimate acquisition of undue gains are all sufficient to increase the antipathy of the general public in our country. If this continues without end, it will inevitably lead to a situation that cannot be reconciled. How can this be a blessing for both countries? In addition to our grief and concern, we still want to exhaust our loyalty and consideration to earnestly tell the wise men of Japan: In the midst of this call for adjusting national relations, if the Japanese side truly has no sincerity, then so be it. But if they still have this desire, then the so-called adjustment of national relations should take adjusting the feelings of the people of both countries as a prerequisite. And the prerequisites for adjusting the feelings of the people are: 1. Abandoning methods of deception and establishing a sincere approach; 2. Eliminating notions of suspicion and cultivating a spirit of understanding; 3. Changing a ferocious demeanor and adopting a moderate attitude. If attention can be paid to improving these three points, then the feelings between the peoples of both countries will surely be able to achieve a swift transformation. Then, by following the proper steps and engaging in diplomatic negotiations, Chinese-Japanese relations will be able to enter the smooth path of friendly cooperation without much adjustment.</p>

He never accepted a single penny improperly and lived an extremely frugal life. His life's spirit of fortitude and unyielding character came from his frugal lifestyle. Since participating in the revolution, Mr. Zhixin has been brave and taken the lead in the battles of Zhennan and Guangzhou, suffering serious injuries. Later, he participated in all major party work and was hardworking and dedicated, never shirking any difficult work, regardless of how dangerous, with the heart of dying for the country, for more than ten years as one day. Unfortunately, he was assassinated by thugs on this day in 1920. While it was a case of sacrificing his life for righteousness for him personally, it was an extremely significant loss for our party. Now, we hold a meeting to commemorate him once a year because his character can serve as a model for party comrades. When we recall everything about him, we naturally feel admiration, and on the one hand, seeing the increasingly urgent national crisis and the heavy task of national construction, we should also constantly make ourselves feel ashamed and strive harder. What our comrades and the people of the whole country need most now is the cultivation of character, courage, diligence, and the willingness to forget oneself for the public and one's family for the country. Mr. Zhixin has given us a very good model." (Central News Agency telegram, 21st)</p>

He then described Mr. Zhu's martyrdom, concluding by saying that he hoped everyone would emulate Mr. Zhu's spirit, be of one heart and one mind, unite sincerely, share the national crisis together, save the nation from danger, and comfort Mr. Zhu in the afterlife.

Present were Minister Fang Zhi, Secretary Zhang Guoren, Section Chief Hong Ruizhao, Section Chief Gao Yinzu, Deputy Minister of Finance Zou Lin, Director Gao Bingfang, Secretaries Cui Weiwu and Zhang Tingxiu, and more than 60 reporters from various newspapers. Chairman Fang Zhi, after opening the meeting, reported briefly, saying that today's reception for the gentlemen of the Beijing press is to announce a very important and happy message to everyone, which is that the central government has decided to begin collecting income tax on October 1st of this month. Income tax is the most common and fair tax system. The government's decision to implement it on schedule is of great significance. In the past, the domestic public opinion circles had once made efforts to publicize and enthusiastically support the implementation of income tax. Now that this excellent tax system is about to be implemented on schedule, it is hoped that the national public opinion circles will make another round of expanded publicity, vigorously promote it, and prove the past theory with future facts, so that the national public can understand that implementing income tax is the only way to abolish harsh and miscellaneous taxes and reorganize the tax system. Today, the department also invited Deputy Minister of Finance Zou Lin, Director Gao, Secretary Cui, and Secretary Zhang to explain in detail the preparation process and the responsible departments of income tax, for the reference of the press in publicity, etc. Then Deputy Minister of Finance Zou Lin reported, saying that today the Central Propaganda Department invited everyone here to talk about the implementation of income tax. Minister Kong originally intended to come and participate, but he went to Shanghai for business and has not returned, so I was asked to meet with you instead, which I am very happy about. Income tax is a relatively fair and excellent tax system, and Minister Fang has just explained it in detail, and I think everyone is also very clear about it, so I won't repeat it. Regarding the process of the Ministry of Finance preparing to implement income tax, from the initial planning to the recent future implementation, the Ministry of Finance has set up a special preparatory committee to take charge of the matter. All planning has been the responsibility of Director Gao for several months. Please Director Gao report the details and hope everyone will give guidance and promote it as much as possible. Then Gao Bingfang reported, roughly divided into (1) the legislative process of this decision to implement income tax, and the detailed situation of the Ministry of Finance's preparations for implementation, (2) the scope of income tax taxation, (3) the research on income tax rates, (4) the steps for China to implement income tax collection. After Gao reported, Cui Weiwu reported, saying that he has served in the Party Headquarters for a long time, and for the publicity work, he affirmed the greatness and importance of its strength. He hoped that the press would make efforts to publicize the central government's implementation of income tax, and asked all newspapers to publish propaganda articles and news about propaganda from all sides on September 28th, 29th, and 30th as much as possible, and hoped that newspapers would publish more articles before the implementation of income tax to promote the advantages of this tax system. In addition to reporting on the publicity of the implementation of income tax, Cui also discussed the reporting and propaganda guidelines of various newspapers on politics, diplomacy, and current affairs, for the reference of the press. Finally, Wang Gongtao, the president of the Chaobao, raised the following questions after the implementation of income tax: (1) Before the promulgation of the Commercial Capital Registration Law, what method should be used to accurately calculate the capital of commercial firms and determine the standard for taxation? (2) When most of the old-fashioned bookkeeping is still in existence throughout the country, and new-style bookkeeping has not yet been widely adopted, how to audit the net profit of commercial firms' business income and levy income tax? Minister Fang and Director Gao of the Ministry of Finance answered separately. The meeting adjourned after 5 p.m. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<h3>Amidst the Unrest in Europe, the League of Nations Assembly Opened Yesterday Morning; Nine-Member Committee Appointed to Review Abyssinian Delegate Credentials; Rumor that Abyssinian Emperor Arrived in Geneva and Will Exert All Efforts to Compete</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The 17th Regular Session of the League of Nations Assembly, because the new building has not yet been completed, was held in the Geneva State Council Chamber at 10:50 a.m. today amidst the precarious situation in Spain and the troubling Abyssinian issue. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly meeting opened at 10:30 a.m. this morning.

It is reported that the Abyssinian representative is Dr. Martin, the Abyssinian ambassador to Britain. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Chairman Delivers Opening Remarks</p>
<p>The chairman of the Executive Yuan, the Chilean representative Rivas, served as the temporary chairman and delivered the opening remarks, stating that this Assembly "has a decisive force for the fate of mankind." The League of Nations affairs should be popularized worldwide, and the existing methods and principles should be reorganized based on past experience, and then the reorganization work should be started. In addition, the world economic recovery, which was seen at the opening of the last Assembly, is hoped to be continued by this Assembly, and the European situation should also be stabilized. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Abyssinia requested to attend today's decision meeting, and acceptance should be decided by the Credentials Committee. However, member states are unwilling to take on the responsibilities of the committee, so in order to eliminate this difficulty, it is proposed to organize a committee with the countries that do not refuse to serve on the committee, or the countries that initially refused but after persuasion have not refused, to handle this matter.</p>
<p>Organizing the Credentials Committee</p>
<p>Therefore, Rivas suggested that a committee should be organized with representatives from Britain, France, Russia, the Netherlands, Peru, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Turkey, or New Zealand to consider the issue, but the final decision should be made by the entire Assembly. As for the Abyssinian representative seat, it will be temporarily reserved. Without establishing a Credentials Committee, the Assembly cannot carry out its work. Now that the group has been established, everything can proceed unimpeded.</p>
<p>Abyssinian Emperor Determined to Compete</p>
<p>It is rumored that the uncrowned Abyssinian emperor has arrived in Geneva from London by plane and intends to assist his delegation in striving for the right to attend the Assembly meeting. Therefore, it is expected that there will be a debate on the issue. If Abyssinia cannot win, it will appeal to the Permanent International Court of Justice in The Hague for a fair ruling. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<h3>Speech by Spanish Foreign Minister Explaining the Situation of the Civil War; Confident that the Government Will Win</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Spanish representative to the League of Nations, Foreign Minister del Vayo, was formerly the vice president of the League of Nations International Journalists Association. Recently, the Spanish cabinet was reorganized, and he became the Foreign Minister. He is now representing the country in Geneva. Today, the Executive Committee of the League of Nations International Journalists Association held a banquet to welcome him. del Vayo gave a speech, stating, "After arriving in Geneva, I apologize for not being able to answer the questions of journalists from various countries about the situation of the Spanish Civil War. When I left Spain, I had decided that my first statement would be made on the League of Nations platform. At that time, I will state everything about the Spanish Civil War in a frank and straightforward manner." The Spanish rebels had been preparing to start an incident for more than a year. The government's only purpose now is to enable the government army to achieve final victory and preserve the democratic politics that the people desire. In order to cope with the emergency, the government had to take various counter-insurgency measures. However, the current situation has improved, and we will eventually win, because we have the support of the people. The longer the time, the more beneficial it is to us. There is already a serious mutiny within the rebel forces. Although the rebels have occasionally won military victories recently, they cannot solve the Spanish problem. Only a government freely elected by the people can find a way to solve it. Referring to the women and children in the Alcázar of Toledo, del Vayo said that the government had long proposed to rescue the women and children in the Alcázar. When the diplomatic corps, especially the head of the diplomatic corps, Chilean Ambassador Magallanes, took on the task of mediation, the government again generously agreed to provide convenience. It can be seen that the women and children in the Alcázar have not been released, and this is not the fault of the government. Finally, del Vayo also expressed his condolences to the journalists from various countries who died in the line of duty during the Spanish Civil War. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<h3>Poland Deeply Concerned About the Colonial Issue</h3>
<p>Warsaw: A special dispatch from our reporter. The Polish government has submitted a request to the League of Nations that a seat be added to the League of Nations Mandates Commission for the country. This move is intended to show that Poland is very concerned about the issue of immigration and colonization. The population of Poland increases by 400,000 people every year, and there are 3.5 million Jews among the residents, and 100,000 people need to be relocated abroad every year. In this regard, Palestine in Western Asia is not enough to accommodate so many people, so land should be found in Africa and South America for relocating the population, and financially wealthy countries should provide financial assistance. Among the Polish shipping companies, the "Polish Colonial Shipping Company" is the most powerful, which is enough to show the importance of the colonial issue. As for the issue of re-allocation of colonies, if the countries concerned allow Germany to recover its former colonies in the future, Poland also wants to enjoy the same benefits, because when Germany was vigorously developing and operating in the past, some provinces in western Poland belonged to Germany and contributed as much as other provinces in Germany, so they should share the benefits in the future.

<h3>French Minister of War Claims: Voluntary Peace; Will Appeal to the World to Strengthen the Inherent Right to National Defense</h3>
<p>Lyon, France: Minister of National Defense Daladier said at the Congress of the Radical Socialist Party in the Lower Seine Province today, "Within a few days, France will issue a painful appeal to the world to point out France's desire for peace, but this appeal is not enough. We must also make the people of other countries understand that France has decided to use all means to make our country respected. What France requires of its neighbors is nothing more than good neighborly relations. Now, if we see that this neighbor has implemented industrial mobilization, and still think that France should not have the right to organize national defense, or even the obligation to organize it, then that person must not be sincere. The position of the French Republic is frank and sincere, and it is not the French people who refuse to join hands with other nations. As for what kind of system other countries adopt, it has nothing to do with us. It has been so in the past, and it will be so in the future. It is our duty to make France the homeland of free citizens, and not the homeland of slaves." (Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<h3>Refusing Abyssinian Delegates Attendance; Actually Already Decided; Only Procedural Issues Remain</h3>
<p>(Geneva) At the 17th Assembly of the League of Nations, which opened this morning, the decision to not allow the Abyssinian delegation to attend can be said to have been decided in practice. Even if the Emperor of the country is on his way and will arrive here soon, it will not change it. However, due to procedural reasons, it must be formally decided this afternoon. This is because the major powers are now doing their best to ensure that the Abyssinian issue is no longer discussed at this Assembly. This is why the representatives of Britain, France, Russia, and other countries agreed to participate in the Credentials Committee. However, Soviet representative Litvinov recently stated clearly that if the committee or the Assembly refuses the Abyssinian delegation attendance in the future, he will abstain from voting. Other national representatives will likely follow suit. The Abyssinian delegation, the country's ambassador to Britain, Dr. Martin, recently stated that if the Assembly refuses the Abyssinian delegation attendance, the Emperor will seek justice from the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague.

<h3>German Diplomatic Activities; Organizing Anti-Soviet Group; German-Hungarian Talks Strengthen Friendship; Goebbels Visits Greek Authorities</h3>
<p>Budapest, Hungary: German Foreign Minister Neurath met with Hungarian Foreign Minister Kanya this morning for two hours. The conversation between the two, in addition to the sincere friendship between Germany and Hungary, also recounted the personal friendship between the two in the past, because Neurath and Kanya have been old friends for many years.

<h3>Labour Government George's Impression of Germany: German Military Expansion Aims at Self-Defense, Russian-German War Can Be Avoided at Present</h3>
<p>(London) Former Prime Minister George, leader of the Liberal Party opposition, visited Germany earlier this month, meeting with the German head of state, Hitler. Having returned home, he gave a statement at the request of the News Chronicle, saying, "Germany has no intention of attacking any European country. Head of State Hitler's military expansion is for self-defense, not for attacking others. I firmly believe that Germany and Russia will not engage in war for at least ten years. Unless countries with stronger military forces attack Germany, Hitler will never willingly initiate war. As for the country's army, it now possesses a large machine gun corps, the most powerful defensive weapons, and strong defensive fortifications. Since these are for self-defense, they are justifiable. However, if this force were used for cross-border conquests, there would be little hope of success. Furthermore, the Memel Territory and the Free City of Danzig originally belonged to German territory, just like Hull belongs to England. Their history is even longer than Cardiff in Wales belongs to England. It is only natural for Hitler to want to reclaim these places, but the millions of Slavic residents in those places are unwilling to be assimilated, as this would conflict with the racial unity theory advocated by the National Socialist Party." Labour Government George then spoke about the questionnaire sent by the British government to Germany on May 7th, saying, "This questionnaire should not have been sent in the first place. The military strength of France and Italy is far greater than that of Germany. Why don't we present a questionnaire to them?" (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<h3>Obstructing Japan's Aggression Against China: Refusing to Cooperate with the United States: British Policy Forged a Great Mistake: Stirrings in London Political Circles After the Publication of Stimson's New Book</h3>
<p>(London) Today, a newspaper's book review column carried a critique of the recently published book "The Crisis in the Far East" by former U.S. Secretary of State Stimson, saying, "The materials in the book all contain dates, and the official documents are all recorded from the original text, and written in rigorous language. It is the sharpest criticism ever made by a friendly foreign minister against British foreign policy." The New Statesman and Nation magazine said, "The United Kingdom's failure to cooperate with the United States to resist Japanese aggression is one of the greatest failures in the history of the League of Nations." The inclination of most critics is to blame the United Kingdom for its failure to support President Hoover and Secretary of State Stimson's policy of refusing to recognize Japan's territorial acquisitions in China as a mistake. When the September 18th and January 28th incidents occurred, Stimson was the Secretary of State under President Hoover. In his book, Stimson sincerely evaluated British foreign policy at the time from the American perspective, which has now caused a shock in diplomatic and political circles. A surprising feature of Stimson's book is his vigorous effort to promote cooperation between the United Kingdom and the United States to implement an active policy in China, which ultimately failed. It is said that he spoke with Sir Simon (then British Foreign Secretary) three times on the transatlantic telephone, earnestly informing him that Japan's actions would endanger the world's peace system and that international cooperation should be urgently used to prevent the success of Japan's policy. Stimson said, "Based on the attitude of Sir Simon, I finally realized that the British government did not want to participate in this action, so I stopped urging them." Stimson also said that he wisely proposed invoking the Nine-Power Treaty to resist Japan, believing that the power of the City of London was the obstacle to British action. The United States was not only willing to cooperate with the League of Nations at that time, but also willing to lead other countries in carrying out everything. The fact that the member states of the League of Nations eventually accepted the principle of not recognizing the territory occupied by aggression in Geneva was still the result of the United States' vigorous advocacy. Stimson spoke highly of the value of Britain's subsequent cooperation. (Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>French Cash Flows to the United States: Franc Devaluation May Be Inevitable</h3>
<p>(New York) The Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced today that the value of gold shipped from France to the United States last week totaled $30,642,000. The continued inflow of European gold has caused great concern in financial circles. People here predict that the gold reserves in the upcoming reports of the Bank of France will decrease to the lowest amount since 1931, but the gold reserves of the United States are increasing every week, and will soon create a new record. Investors are quite wary in view of this fact, because the inflow of French gold proves the instability of the country's political situation and the instability of workers. Most well-informed observers here believe that the devaluation of the franc will eventually be inevitable. (Guomin dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<h3>Western Rebel Army Advances Rapidly: Madrid in Imminent Danger: Government Troops Actively Deploy Defenses: Prepare for a Final Decisive Battle</h3>
<p>Gibraltar: According to a telegram received here, it has been confirmed that the Spanish rebel army is approaching Madrid, and the government's position is in imminent danger. (Guomin dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>Lisbon: In view of the rapid advance of the rebel army towards Madrid, the Spanish government is now actively consolidating the defense of the capital. According to the military correspondent of the Lisbon Daily News, solid defensive works have been built around the capital, and the latest type of trench line has been constructed. The underground defenses are also very thorough. However, the work of protecting the artillery has not been completed, so the artillery is vulnerable to bombing. The fiercest battles seem to be within the city, because the People's Front is skilled in street fighting. Therefore, before the rebel army claims to be able to defeat Madrid, the city will inevitably be devastated. The buildings in all important locations in the city have been converted into forts, with a large amount of food and ammunition stored inside. Therefore, even if the rebel army breaks through the artillery forts in the suburbs, it will still take several weeks of hard fighting to occupy the entire city. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Lisbon: The rebel army on the Talavera side in Spain fought fiercely with the government army all day today and is now advancing towards Madrid. According to an announcement from the rebel army, they killed 2,500 government soldiers and captured many prisoners. However, the rebel army did not state the number of casualties. It also said that the government army has no fighting spirit, and the situation of their retreat is very chaotic, abandoning many guns and ammunition. If the rebel army's claims are true, then the rebel army is currently less than 35 miles from the capital, indicating that the situation in the capital is very critical. According to a telegram from an Associated Press reporter, the rebel army on the northern front is now less than 30 miles from Madrid and can attack at any time. General Mola, commander of the rebel army on the northern front, issued a final warning to the authorities in Bilbao, demanding that the government army surrender, otherwise he will launch a bombing campaign.

<p>Siege of the Ancient Castle: Continued Hard Fighting</p>
<p>Madrid: The government army, which has been besieging the Moroccan-style ancient castle of Alcázar in Toledo for nine weeks, made further progress after a day of hard fighting. At the same time, a column of rebel army fighting to aid the defenders in the castle is reported to be still 14 miles away from Toledo. The government army and civilians tried to climb the walls of the castle with ladders, throwing hand grenades as they advanced, but were driven back by the rebel army's volleys. Then they bombarded the castle with artillery shells, bombs, and hand grenades for two hours, causing thick smoke and flying sand. As a result, the government army was able to occupy some locations. Spanish Prime Minister Caballero personally visited the battlefield. At the same time, the Chilean Ambassador to Spain, Mochado, is making efforts to rescue the women and children in the castle, but success is still uncertain. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<h3>Incident of Conflict Between Chinese and Japanese Troops in Fengtai: The Goal of Forcing the 29th Army to Withdraw Has Been Achieved. The Situation in Tianjin is Tense, with Large-Scale Parades by Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: On the anniversary of the "September 18th Incident," a serious incident almost occurred at Fengtai Station on the Beining Railway. Fortunately, the 29th Army endured humiliation and sought reconciliation, and the overwhelming crisis was resolved. The course of events is described as follows:</p>
<p>Since this spring, a regiment of the 38th Division of the 29th Army, under the command of Zhang Zizhong, has been stationed at Fengtai Station. Later, due to a conflict over the seizure of war horses between Chinese and Japanese troops, the unit was forced to withdraw under diplomatic pressure from the Japanese side. Another regiment from the 110th Brigade of the 37th Division, the 222nd Regiment under Zhang, was stationed there, with the number of personnel reduced several times compared to before. The Japanese military barracks in Fengtai were completed in July of this year, and the number of troops increased to over a thousand, changing the relative strength of the two sides. Although the 29th Army regarded the town as a key military point, under the prevailing atmosphere of harmonious diplomacy in North China, it could only carefully arrange its defenses. However, even with the number of soldiers reduced to a battalion, the Japanese side was still not satisfied and repeatedly used indirect methods of expulsion to force the unit to withdraw. For example, on the 21st of last month, a Japanese resident named Morikawa Taro broke into Zhang's military camp for no reason, resulting in a fight with the guards in which he was stabbed and injured. The dispute lasted almost a month before it was resolved through negotiations between Matsumuro and Chen Zhongfu. Before this dispute had completely passed, a conflict suddenly broke out between the two armies on the afternoon of the 18th during a drill, escalating into a shooting. Although it is not possible to conclude that this was a planned action by the Japanese side, it can be seen from the fact that the 29th Army in Fengtai was forced to withdraw under the requested conditions, and from the statements made by Matsumuro, Hashimoto, and Wachi during their visit to Song in Peiping in mid-month, that the Japanese troops stationed in Fengtai felt threatened by the 29th Army and that Chinese troops must be withdrawn to prevent incidents. The general assessment was not entirely wrong.</p>
<p>The conflict on the 18th involved Sun Xiangting's 5th Company of Zhang's unit of the 29th Army. At 5:40 PM, during a fall training exercise outside the railway, they encountered a company of Japanese troops stationed locally, commanded by Captain Hozumi, who were also conducting exercises in the same direction. The two groups met on a narrow road and refused to yield. Iwai, a lieutenant and squad leader under Captain Hozumi, then took the opportunity to ride his horse into Sun's company. Unable to endure this, a soldier from Sun's company struck the horse with the butt of his rifle, sparking the conflict. The Japanese soldiers considered this an insult, and Captain Hozumi immediately ordered them to form a skirmish line and surround Sun's company, intending to disarm them. Company commander Sun Xiangting stepped forward to negotiate with the Japanese troops, but was captured and held within their lines. Sun's company was enraged and took defensive measures, confronting the Japanese troops. At this time, Major Ichiki, the commander of the Japanese battalion, received a report and led all of his soldiers to the front of Zhang's camp, setting up four machine guns to prevent soldiers from Zhang's camp from providing assistance. The standoff lasted until around 7:00 PM, when Colonel Mutaguchi Renya, the commander of the 1st Infantry Regiment of the Kawabe Brigade of the Japanese troops stationed in Peiping, led a large company of soldiers and a small artillery unit on a forced march to Fengtai. Upon arriving at Daqing Village near Fengtai, they had a misunderstanding with the 6th Company of Zhang's camp and exchanged fire. For a time, nearby houses were forcibly occupied by the Japanese soldiers, who, from their elevated positions, forced Zhang's camp to surrender. When Song Zheyuan in Tianjin received the report, he immediately telephoned Feng Zhi'an, the division commander in Peiping, instructing him to quickly cooperate with Chen Zhongfu and Japanese military officials Matsumuro, Imai, and Kawabe Brigade Commander to resolve the situation and prevent a war from breaking out. At the same time, he also sent representatives to negotiate with the headquarters of the Japanese Garrison Army in North China. The Japanese side sent Staff Officer Ikeda from Tianjin, attached member Suzuki, and Staff Officers Kai and Asai, as well as Aide-de-Camp Kawada. From Peiping, the advisers Yingjing and Nakajima (military advisers to the 29th Army) were sent. Song sent Zhen Mingzhang, a consultant to the Tianjin Municipal Government, Liu Shaokun, an advisor, and Xu Changlin, the deputy division commander of the 37th Division, among others. They set off from Peiping and Tianjin separately and met at Fengtai Station around 6:00 AM on the 19th, joining Feng's division commander Zhang. Together with Japanese Army Colonel Mutaguchi, Battalion Commander Ichiki, they held joint discussions, and it was not until 9:00 AM that a decision was reached. The two sides then lifted the confrontation. Company commander Sun Xiangting was taken to the Japanese military police headquarters in Peiping, where he was released after being questioned about any other role he might have played. Zhang's battalion began its withdrawal around 2:00 PM on the 19th and was expected to be completed by the morning of the 20th. When this incident occurred, the Tianjin Japanese military department held an emergency meeting at 11:00 PM, chaired by Tashiro, with Hashimoto and other staff members participating. The resolutions were quite serious. On the morning of the 19th, over a thousand Japanese troops stationed in Dongjuzi marched fully armed through the Dongma Road area of the city. More than ten armored vehicles also patrolled the Chinese streets in the afternoon. At 11:00 AM, staff officer Wachi was sent to visit Song Zheyuan at his private residence, conveying a serious verbal protest and demanding all rights to protect the case. For a time, people were panicked and uneasy. The Public Security Bureau's security team and armored troops were dispatched to patrol and guard the streets. In the afternoon, Cheng Jiaxian, the director of the Public Security Bureau, convened an emergency security meeting, strictly instructing the heads of each branch bureau and security team to carefully deploy their defenses. In the evening, the news of a peaceful resolution was released, and the Japanese troops also ended their demonstration parade, gradually calming the people's hearts. (19th)</p>
<h3>Details of the Shooting of a Japanese Policeman in the Hankou Concession: Japanese Navy Lands, Police Increase Patrols, and Electric Nets Are Extensively Deployed. The Result of the Chinese-Japanese Joint Trial of Arrested Chinese Reveals No Clues</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Yesterday (the 19th), a sudden shooting of a patrolman occurred in the Japanese Concession of Hankou. As a result, the Japanese Navy landed, police increased patrols, and a network of electric nets was extensively deployed. Many Chinese were arrested. The results of the Chinese-Japanese joint trial have so far revealed no clues. The details of what happened after the incident are recorded below. At 11:30 AM on the 19th, a patrolman at the 4th Station on Taisho Street in the Japanese Concession arrived to take over his shift and discovered that the patrolman on duty, Niichiro Yoshioka, had been shot and killed. Two bullet casings were found beside the body. The incident was reported to the head of the Japanese police station, Shimoda, who ordered all Japanese police to mobilize and be on alert. On the one hand, they searched pedestrians entering and leaving the Japanese Concession, and on the other hand, they transferred Yoshioka's body to the Doujin Hospital, where it was dissected by the head of the surgery department, Nozawa. The examination revealed that the bullet had entered from behind the left ear and through the left neck, directly penetrating the medulla oblongata, resulting in immediate death. At this time, several hundred marines from a Japanese warship landed to assist the police in enforcing martial law. The Japanese Concession suddenly entered a state of emergency. Seven Chinese were arrested: two each of peddlers and boatmen, and three small vendors. They were all detained at the Japanese police station for questioning. Fortunately, the boatmen and pedestrians were released, while the vendors were detained for trial. After receiving notification from the Japanese side, Wu Guozhen, the mayor of Hankou, expressed his condolences to the Japanese Consul General Miura by telephone. Chen Xizeng, the director of the Public Security Bureau, also sent Inspector Wang Yufen, Section Chief Dong Keren, and Wan Dixiu, the director of the 13th Branch Bureau of Public Security, to the Japanese police station to express their condolences to Shimoda, the head of the station, and stated that if the Japanese side needed assistance from the Chinese authorities in the investigation or arrest of the murderer, the Chinese authorities would provide assistance. The Japanese side expressed its gratitude for this. While the Japanese police continued to search pedestrians, the naval marines had already returned to their ships, and order gradually returned to normal. At night, the Japanese marines landed again and formed patrol teams of four men each, patrolling throughout the night. On the morning of the 20th, the Japanese police doubled the number of patrolmen and intensified the inspection of pedestrians. Electric nets were also set up at the entrances of various roads, and the situation became even more tense than before. In the afternoon, the Japanese side requested that the Chinese authorities send personnel to jointly try the captured vendors. The municipal government sent Secretary Zhang Jinghuai, the Public Security Bureau sent Inspector Wang Yufen and Section Chief Dong Keren to the Japanese police station to conduct a joint trial with the Japanese police officers. However, among the captured vendors, one was an elderly man named Huang Qingyun, who was 73 years old, and another was a child named Liu Xiya, who was only eight years old. Huang lived at No. 40, Third Lane, Lower Slope, and Liu lived at No. 22, Yongqing Street. Both made a living selling cigarettes and sundries. One was senile, and the other was ignorant, so the results of the interrogation revealed no clues. On that evening, the security in the Japanese Concession was tightened. Five Japanese warships, including the Ataka, Katata, Futami, and Ren, were anchored on the river. Commander Hino, stationed on the Ataka, also landed to meet with Consul Miura and military officials to hold discussions. At the same time, Japanese residents held a general meeting at the Kojikai Club to exchange views on the case. Takamichi Kazuo, dispatched by the Japanese residents in Shanghai, and Hikita Tetsutaro, dispatched by the Japanese residents in Beijing, arrived in Hankou by China Aviation airplane to conduct investigations. After the incident occurred, the Japanese deputy chief, Shirai, issued a statement, stating on the one hand that the location of the incident was not under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Concession, and on the other hand that when the deceased was shot, he was buying cigarettes at a cigarette stall, so bullet casings were left near the cigarette stall, and that the discovery of his body near the post was probably because the Chinese in the vicinity moved the body to the post after the incident. This is far from the truth. The location where Yoshioka was killed was at the Taisho Street intersection in the Japanese Concession, 300 meters from the post of the 13th Branch Police Station of the Chinese authorities. A post had already been set up between them, but in August of the 17th year of the Republic of China, Ogawa, the head of the Japanese Police Station, notified the 4th Public Security Bureau and ordered the post to be removed and prohibited from being set up. The Taisho Street intersection is even more within the scope of the Japanese Concession. As for the bullet casings found, they are indeed worth investigating. The type of bullet is the smallest "Berliner." This gun cannot hit a person unless it is extremely close, and the Chinese never use this type of bullet. If the Japanese authorities pay attention to this, the facts of the case may become clear. (20th)</p>

<h3>Recent Situation in Guangdong and Guangxi (2)</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Xiao An</p>
<p>Chairman Huang's Remarks</p>
<p>Huang Musong, the chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, is a senior figure in the Guangdong military. The Fourth Army Commander Yu Hanmou and others are all his students. Huang used to be the superintendent of the Whampoa Military Academy, training many military talents. Huang has been a member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission in recent years and has always been relied upon by the central government. Last month, Yu Hanmou went to Beijing to attend the Second Plenary Session and asked the central government to lead his troops back to Guangdong from southern Jiangxi. Huang and Yu had a teacher-student relationship, so Huang's support for Yu in Beijing was quite effective. Therefore, the Guangdong situation was settled, and Huang was ordered to preside over the provincial government. Huang is humble and amiable, pays attention to moral integrity, and meets with guests every day to broadly collect public opinion, which is a great blessing for Guangdong Province.</p>
<p>The reporter went to the provincial government at 4:30 PM on the 18th to see Huang. At that time, Li Zongren and Huang Xuchu also came to the provincial government to pay a visit to Huang. After Li and Huang bid farewell, Huang met with the reporter in the chairman's office. Huang inquired about the situation of the newspaper. The reporter expressed his respect for the Guangdong provincial government's decision to implement a ban on gambling and abolish exorbitant and miscellaneous taxes. Huang then talked about how the provincial government's annual shortfalls of more than 14 million yuan after the gambling ban made administrative expenses difficult. Subsidies for educational undertakings and other facilities in various counties and districts also largely depended on the additional gambling revenue. After the gambling ban, the additional fees were also abolished, so the future of educational undertakings and other facilities in various counties and districts was naturally also affected. However, banning gambling and abolishing exorbitant taxes were to eliminate harm for the people and to remove past malpractices, so the government resolutely implemented them without any worries, etc. The reporter then asked about the new government's future administrative policies. Huang then spoke at length about the necessity of political construction and educational construction, saying that in the past few years, Chen Bonan's three-year plan, whether good or bad, focused on material construction and industrial construction. However, material construction and industrial construction are not the most urgent needs at present. If we can first start with political construction, making politics on track, officials honest, and the people happy in their work, and at the same time strive for educational construction to improve national knowledge and enable them to distinguish between benefits and harms, then material construction and industrial construction will be easier to promote and achieve success. As for those in power, the heavier the responsibility, the stricter they should be in restraining themselves, and they must use the highest moral character as an example for their subordinates. Only those who can be admired by the people can achieve good results in governance. By the time the conversation reached this point, more than 20 minutes had passed, and the reporter then made his farewells.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Arrest of Refugees for Robbery</h3>

The refugees were then divided into groups and sent to various villages to beg for food. About 50 or 60 refugees also came to Panlong Township and crowded into Lu Qintang's house to demand food. They then went to the house of his brother, Lu Yonggen. Yonggen's daughter, Fengzhen, was about to be married and was rushing to prepare her wedding clothes and purchase gold and silver jewelry. The refugees, taking advantage of their numbers, robbed all the clothes and jewelry and also injured Lu Qintang's head in the resistance, causing a wound and profuse bleeding. Villagers, seeing this, hurriedly beat gongs to gather a crowd, detained the refugee representatives Xu and Wang, and the rest scattered and fled. The villagers then tied up the refugee representatives and sent them to the Sixth Sub-Station of Sijing, who transferred them to the main bureau. Bureau Chief He Runzhang, considering that the refugees were causing disturbances in the countryside and urgently needed to be suppressed, immediately dispatched Detective Yang Shijie and Inspector Yang Jingjiang to Sijing to investigate and interrogate the refugee representatives. They all denied leading the crowd in robbery, and the victim, Lu Qintang, also feared making enemies and was unwilling to pursue the matter, saying that he would seek medical treatment for his injuries himself. The autumn harvest is coming in the four rural districts and the refugees will continue to pour in. The public safety in the villages is worth noting.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Adulterous Woman Elopes with Thief</h3>
<p>Hui Fubei, a resident of Beizhuang, part of Nanqiao Town in Suzhou, used to work in a dyeing factory in Shanghai. Recently, he has been unemployed and makes a living by farming at home. When Fubei was in Shanghai, his wife, Wang, became intimate with Liu Jinbao. Now that Fubei is at home, the adulterous couple cannot act as they please, so they came up with a strange idea. Wang colluded with Liu, who invited more than ten hooligans, each carrying a weapon. At about 4 a.m. the day before yesterday (the 20th), they crowded into Cao's house to rob. Wang acted as an inside accomplice, tying up Cao Fubei and others, and also injuring Cao's father, Yinbao (who is over eighty years old). They looted for three hours before Liu and Yu Dou took Wang away along with the stolen goods and fled together. Yesterday, Cao Fubei reported the case to the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Arrest of Traffickers</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 21st) at about 2 p.m., Patrol Officer Liang Biwu of the 32nd Sub-Station, acting on a tip, learned that there was human trafficking activity at No. 118 Dongfang Hotel in the North Bureau. He immediately led police officers to arrest Zhang Daogen and his daughter Da Yuan (20 years old), who lived at No. 161 Wuqufang, as well as Zhu Peigen and his wife, Ye, and a woman named Zhou Jin, who lived in Duan'anli, Xinzha Road, Shanghai. All of them were taken to the station and sent to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Female Student Commits Suicide by Jumping into a Well</h3>
<p>Pan Liying, a 17-year-old first-year student at Shuxue Girls' Middle School in Yingshanhe, Guangfu Gate, was from Bijie County, Guizhou Province. Since childhood, she had been betrothed to Wang Mingzhong, a fellow villager, through her parents' arrangement. Mingzhong is now 16 years old and not yet married. His uncle, Wang Puqing, is currently the battalion commander of the Communications Battalion of the 36th Division of the Army, stationed in Huishan in this city. During the summer vacation, Mingzhong, his sister Mingxiao, and his fiancée Pan Liying came south from Guizhou to study. Mingzhong was admitted to Nandou Wangnan Middle School, and Mingxiao and Liying were admitted to the first year of Shuxue Girls' Middle School in Yingshanhe. Since the start of school, it has not been two weeks. They all lived in the school. Their grades were good. On the afternoon of the 16th of this month, Liying suddenly felt dizzy after physical education class and asked for leave to rest in the dormitory upstairs. The school arranged for Dr. Xu Fenghua, the school doctor, to treat her. However, Liying was not used to taking Western medicine. The next day, she was accompanied by a servant, Zhao Ma, to see the Chinese medicine doctor Deng Xingbo, who diagnosed her with malaria. She took the decoction, and by the 19th, the chills and fever had subsided, and she went to class as usual. On the 20th (Sunday) at about 1 p.m., Liying, along with her aunt Qi Mingxiao and several classmates, went to the Huofo Photo Studio in Shengxiangkou to take pictures. At about 5 p.m., Liying returned to school alone to rest, but suddenly felt hot all over and extremely upset. At that time, her nerves seemed to be confused, and she ran outside alone. Ms. Song Shiwen, the Director of Studies of the school, and Ms. Kuang Weiwen, a teacher, went forward to chase and persuade her to return to school. When they reached the courtyard next to the third canteen, Liying, taking advantage of their unpreparedness, suddenly jumped into a well to commit suicide. Mingxiao tried to save her, only grabbing her hand, but because she was unable to hold on, she still fell. She immediately shouted for help. After being rescued by the school servant and neighbors, she was already beyond recovery. The school immediately notified the family of the deceased, Battalion Commander Wang, to come to the school to handle the funeral arrangements. It is said that Liying had written a suicide note, which was handed over to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau for safekeeping. The reason for her suicide is not very clear. Yesterday (the 21st) at 9 a.m., Zheng Jintai, the chief of the local district, reported the case to the court for inspection. The appointed prosecutor went to the scene with officials for the inquest, but the family of the deceased requested to be exempted from the inquest. The prosecutor approved it and ordered them to prepare a coffin and collect the body.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Carelessness at the Dalu Pharmacy</h3>
<p>At about 2 a.m. this morning (the 21st), the Dalu Pharmacy on Siqian Street here was suddenly destroyed by a fire due to negligence, resulting in the death of an apprentice and a loss of more than 10,000 yuan. According to the investigation, the cause of the fire was that a shop runner from Shanghai introduced an apprentice named Bao Haopei from Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province, to the store on the afternoon of the 20th. After being introduced through various connections, he was able to come to Changshu on the afternoon of the 20th. However, it is customary for stores in the interior to light large red candles for the apprentice to pay respects to the master when they first enter the store. Although the apprentice Bao was from out of town, he could not be an exception. Unexpectedly, the candle was not completely burned by midnight. At about 1 a.m., the shopkeepers had already fallen asleep. The candle suddenly toppled over, causing other items to catch fire and leading to the conflagration. When the fire was raging, the other shopkeepers all jumped down from the upper floor and ran away, but the newly arrived apprentice Bao was unfamiliar with the path and was even more panicked after the incident, unable to escape, and thus perished in the fire. It was truly tragic. It is reported that the owner of the pharmacy, Gu Yulin, started by peddling Japanese goods and has now accumulated tens of thousands of yuan to set up this relatively well-equipped Dalu Pharmacy. Now that it has been destroyed, the total loss is estimated to be over 10,000 yuan, although it was insured for 3,000 taels, it is still far from enough.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Party Department Convened the Zhu Zhixin Martyrdom Memorial Meeting Yesterday; Jiang Huaisu Reported the Significance of the Memorial; The Whole City Lowered Flags to Half-Mast, and the Chinese Concession was on Alert</h3>
<p>Yesterday (21st) was the anniversary of Mr. Zhu Zhixin's martyrdom. The Municipal Party Department specially convened representatives from all walks of life at 10 a.m. yesterday in the assembly hall of the department to hold a memorial meeting. The chairman was Jiang Huaisu, the recorder was Du Mengsen, and the master of ceremonies was Zhang Hanyun. The whole city uniformly lowered flags to half-mast in mourning, and the Chinese Concession authorities were on high alert. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Place Arrangement</p>
<p>The meeting place was the assembly hall of the Municipal Party Department. The party and national flags and a white cloth banner were hung in front of the gate, with the words "Shanghai Municipal Representatives from All Walks of Life Hold the Sixteenth Anniversary Memorial Meeting of Mr. Zhu Zhixin's Martyrdom." The party and national flags and the portrait of the Premier were hung in the center of the hall. Order slogans were posted on the left and right, and slogans were pasted all over the four walls. The arrangement was quite solemn.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>Jiang Huaisu from the Municipal Party Department, Huang Kegui from the Municipal Education Association, Lin Kecong from the Municipal Women's Association, Wang Xuequan from the China Education Association, Huang Xianggu from the Chinese Residents Association in the French Concession, Mao Yun from the Second Special District Citizens' Association, Feng Jianhua from the Military Training Association, Zhu Dongwen from the Civic Training Office, He Yuanming from the Accountants' Association, Du Mengsen from the Cooperative Enterprise Promotion Association, Zhu Shide from the National Goods Maintenance Association, Li Huaixiong from the Youth Lecture Group, Zhao Zhenhui from the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, and more than 200 representatives from various agencies, organizations, large, medium, and small schools, district party departments, and district branches.</p>
<p>Meeting Order</p>
<p>(1) Opening of the meeting, (2) Singing of the party song, (5) Bowing three times to the party and national flags and the portrait of the Premier, (4) Reading the Premier's last will and testament, (5) Three minutes of silence to mourn the martyr Mr. Zhu Zhixin, (6) Reporting, (7) Speech, (8) Calling slogans, (9) Adjournment.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the rituals, the chairman reported, saying that today is the memorial week and is combined with the memorial meeting for Mr. Zhu Zhixin's martyrdom. Sixteen years ago today was the day of Mr. Zhu's martyrdom. At that time, Lu Rongting and Cao Rongxin occupied Guangzhou, and the people were in dire straits. Mr. Zhu feared that the revolutionary forces would be interrupted, so he followed the Premier's order to contact the army to suppress Mo, occupied the Humen Fort, and was unfortunately assassinated by the Guixi rebels. He was only thirty-six years old. Mr. Zhu was thrifty, diligent in his studies, and always had a book in his hand. He was a model for future generations. His revolutionary achievements are even more indelible. The current situation is more dangerous than when Mr. Zhu was martyred. Incidents in Chengdu, Beihai, Hankou, and Fengtai have occurred one after another. Although the Fengtai incident has now come to an end, we can only strive for survival in this environment. Now our country only fears internal troubles and does not worry about external conflicts. The recent Guangdong-Guangxi incident has been peacefully resolved, and it has had a good impact on all other incidents. This matter is entirely due to Mr. Jiang's magnanimity and appropriate measures. Otherwise, international incidents would definitely worsen. Today, in commemorating Mr. Zhu, we must emulate Mr. Zhu's thrift and diligence in learning, and at the same time, we should admire Mr. Jiang's spirit of hard work. Everyone should work hard to survive and strive forward. Then he called slogans, and the ceremony was adjourned.</p>
<p>Meeting Slogans</p>
<p>(1) Inherit the spirit of Mr. Zhu, (2) Emulate the personality of Mr. Zhu, (3) The spirit of Mr. Zhu Zhixin is immortal, (4) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang, (5) Long live the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Half-Mast Alert</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Party Department convened the memorial meeting for Mr. Zhu Zhixin's martyrdom. All organs, organizations, large, medium, and small schools, and all levels of party departments in this city, in addition to sending representatives to participate in the memorial meeting, also lowered flags to half-mast for one day in mourning. The Municipal Public Security Bureau and the police departments of the two concessions, considering yesterday to be a revolutionary memorial day and fearing that unscrupulous elements would take advantage of the opportunity to cause trouble, ordered their subordinates to implement vigilance.</p>
<h3>Baoshan Seawall: Leaks Urgently Need Major Repairs; Dangerous Sections Destroyed by Hurricanes are Repaired; The Construction Bureau Has Sent Personnel for Inspection and Returned to the Province to Report</h3>
<p>The Baoshan County seawall was breached during the recent hurricane. The breached embankment in Beishidong has now been repaired. The Construction Bureau of Jiangsu Province believes that the autumn flood season is approaching and the safety of the seawall is of great importance. It has sent engineers to inspect it for repairs. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Dangerous Sections in Beishidong Completed</p>
<p>The Baoshan County seawall is located at a strategic point of the river and sea and is the most important area for seawall construction in Jiangnan. During each autumn season, the seawall is often eroded by the sea waves. During the recent hurricane, the embankment in Beishidong was completely destroyed by the strong winds and waves. Zhang Mingjing, the magistrate of the county, in addition to reporting to the provincial bureau, instructed the seawall construction office to rush to repair it day and night. The damaged embankments have been blocked with mud and burlap bags, and wooden piles have been driven around the body of the seawall. The dangerous sections have now been completed, and temporary emergency repair materials have been set up to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>The Entire Seawall Project Urgently Needs Major Repairs</p>
<p>The county's seawall is connected to Shanghai and the counties of Taicang and Liuhe. The east and west seawalls, such as Xiaosabei, Beiwangmiao, Wuyuedun, Beishidong, Chenhuabin, and other places, are all at the confluence of the Yangtze River and the Yellow Sea, and the tides are particularly strong. The autumn winds and waves are even more violent. However, due to funding reasons, the entire seawall project has only been repaired temporarily for several years. The body of each section of the seawall is full of leaks, and there are many dangers. The Mid-Autumn Festival flood season is approaching, and the situation is extremely dangerous. Therefore, the people of the county all hope that the province will allocate funds for repairs so that the seawall can be permanently safe.</p>
<p>The Construction Bureau Pays Attention and Sends Personnel for Inspection</p>
<p>After receiving the county government's report, the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Bureau paid great attention to the issue of seawall safety as the autumn flood was approaching. It sent Engineer Tu to inspect it. He was very satisfied with the temporary emergency repair project built by the county. If there are no excessive winds and waves during the autumn flood season, there is nothing to worry about. However, the decision to repair the entire seawall project must be made by the provincial authorities. The engineer has completed the inspection and returned to the province to report.</p>
<h3>Long-Distance Telephone: Cancellation Procedure; The Ministry of Communications Has Revised it; Pilot Program in Beijing-Hankou and Shanghai-Hankou</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate the public and promote business, the Ministry of Communications has ruled that when using long-distance telephones between Beijing and Hankou or Shanghai and Hankou, if the caller only knows the name and address of the called party and does not know their telephone number, they may also apply for registration. If the reported called party is found not to have a telephone installed, or if the installed telephone has been renamed or transferred, or if their name does not match the one listed in the telephone directory and cannot be found, resulting in the inability to connect, a free cancellation of the registration will be allowed. Regarding the advance notice, when registering a telephone call, the caller may simultaneously apply to the calling station to notify the called party, "If the specified called party is not present, resulting in the inability to speak, the telegraph office will notify the called party to inform the calling party that they wish to call back at a certain time." The calling station should notify the receiving station and then notify the called party to follow up. It is reported that the above two new measures have been ordered by the Ministry of Communications to be piloted by the telephone bureaus in the capital, Wuhan, and Shanghai from October 1.</p>

All of his writings are often published in various newspapers and magazines at home and abroad. In July of this year, Mr. Tao took the French mail ship Normandy from the United States to Europe.

He traveled and inspected the political situation in each country. During his travels, Mr. Tao once entered the University of London to continue studying political science. Later, due to repeated telegrams from the Municipal Party Department of this city, he left Europe in the middle of last month and returned to the country by special trip.</p>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai This Morning</p>
<p>The French mail ship Asia Tena, on which Mr. Tao is traveling, will arrive in Shanghai at seven o'clock this morning and will dock at the China Merchants Bureau Central Wharf on Broadway Road.

<h3>Tang Haian is Passive; His Vacancy Will Belong to Tang Xuan; He is Deeply Concerned about Handling Difficult Matters</h3>
<p>Tang Haian, the salt commissioner of Guangdong and Guangxi, returned from northern Guangdong last month to report to Finance Minister Kong on the rectification of the salt administration in Guangdong Province. He has stayed in Shanghai for a month. There was news that he would return to his post, but there has been no formal schedule. According to sources, Tang suddenly took a passive attitude because he was concerned about the difficulty of handling matters. He reportedly submitted his resignation to Finance Minister Kong, who tried to persuade him to stay, but to no avail, and he has been approved. The vacancy may be renamed Director of the Guangdong and Guangxi Salt Affairs Administration, and it has been internally decided that Tang Xuan, the current manager of the Guangdong Salt Affairs Inspection Office, will take over. As soon as the central government officially announces it, Mr. Tang Xuan will take over the new post.</p>
<h3>Ma Mengzhuang Talks about the Strict Prohibition of Opium and Gambling in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Ma Mengzhuang, a senior advisor to the Guangxi Provincial Government, was determined to go to Nanjing from Hong Kong. When he passed through Shanghai, he told visitors that Guangzhou has always been a den of opium and gambling, which is well known and cannot be avoided. The people of Guangdong have suffered countless harms. When Huang Musong was ordered to preside over Guangdong, the people of Guangdong yearned for his style and hoped that he could rejuvenate politics. I also went to Guangzhou to visit in person and learned that he immediately issued a strict ban on opium and gambling. Although he has not been in power for long, the general fair-minded citizens of Guangdong admire Huang's policies and say that they have been longing for it for many years and it has only now been realized. Those who usually rely on opium and gambling as a profession are mostly far away, so one or two places have been slightly affected. However, this is only a temporary situation, and it will soon be restored to its original state. If he can supervise and lead tirelessly, it will not be difficult to completely eliminate it.</p>
<h3>Issuance Begins Next Month: £1.1 Million Loan Secured</h3>
<h3>Repayment from Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Revenue, Not to Be Circulated, Fully Underwritten by Syndicate</h3>
<p>A "Shen Shi News" report: To complete the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, the Ministry of Railways, in May of this year, concluded a £6,000,000 gold loan agreement with a syndicate formed by the Sino-British Banking Corporation and the China Construction Bank. The total amount is £1.1 million (approximately 1.8 million in national currency). After repaying the syndicate's hot money and the outstanding balance owed to the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Railway Company, the remainder will be used to complete the entire Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line and to build the Qiantang River Bridge and the Nanxing Bridge branch line. The contract has been approved by the Executive Yuan and the Central Political Conference and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review and approval. The loan bonds have been entrusted by the Ministry of Railways to the Commercial Press for printing and will be ready soon. The official issuance will begin on the first of next month. The face value is denominated in English gold, divided into three types: £10, £50, and £100. It is understood that in the future, it will not be circulated on the market and will be fully underwritten by the Sino-British Banking Corporation and the China Construction Bank syndicate. After the bonds are delivered, the syndicate will allocate the funds in installments according to the contract provisions. The bonds bear an annual interest rate of 6% and a term of 25 years. Only interest will be paid for the first five years, and principal will be repaid starting in the sixth year, with full repayment by the 50th year of the Republic. The Ministry of Railways has established a management committee to specifically manage the fund for principal and interest repayment, and a portion of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway's operating revenue and the Ministry of Railways' share of the Qiantang River Bridge revenue will be allocated to the management committee as collateral for principal and interest repayment.</p>

<h3>Central, China, and Communications Banks Ordered to Collect</h3>
<h3>Income Tax on Government Bonds and Savings Deposits, Collection Method Adopted Reporting System, Liang Hejun and Others Visited Banking Industry Yesterday to Discuss</h3>
<p>"Xin Xin News" reports: The Ministry of Finance has decided to levy income tax, and on the first of next month, it will first implement three types of tax revenue: civil servants' salaries, government bond interest, and bank deposits. It has also ordered the Central, China, and Communications Banks and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to collect the taxes. Liang Hejun, deputy director of the Direct Tax Preparation Office, and others consulted with the banking industry yesterday on the collection procedures. Details of each situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Three Banks Ordered to Collect Taxes</p>
<p>The three types of income tax to be levied starting on October 1st—civil servants' salaries, government bond interest, and bank deposits—will be handled as follows: Income tax on civil servants' salaries will be deducted and remitted by the accounting departments of the relevant government agencies according to the prescribed amounts. For the remaining income taxes, such as government bond interest and bank deposit interest, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated that they will be collected by the Central, China, and Communications Banks, as well as the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. It is understood that the four institutions have received official orders from the Ministry of Finance, instructing their branches, sub-branches, and offices throughout the country to collect the taxes.</p>
<p>Reporting Method Adopted</p>
<p>The method for collecting income tax on bank deposits and government bond interest has now been decided to be a reporting system, whereby each bank and money shop is responsible for voluntarily reporting the amount of government bonds and deposits held by the bank. The Central Direct Tax Preparation Office will then investigate based on the account books reported by each bank and money shop, and the income tax will be deducted by the bank and money shop from the interest of the depositors. If there are any omissions, the bank and money shop will be responsible. After this method is implemented, bank and money shop employees will have an additional procedure, and depositors and government bondholders will have no way to evade the tax. Therefore, the collection of taxes will not be missed.</p>
<p>Liang Hejun Visits Banking Sector for Discussions</p>
<p>After Liang Hejun (respectfully marrying), deputy director of the Central Direct Tax Preparation Office of the Ministry of Finance, was dispatched to Shanghai with Ning Encheng and Qu Zhaorong, the three visited leaders of the banking and money industries in the city yesterday morning and afternoon, including Chen Xing, vice president of the Central Bank, Chen Guangfu, chairman of the Bankers Association, Lin Kanghou, secretary-general, Bei Songsun, manager of the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China, Zhang Peishen, manager of the Business Bureau of the Bank of Communications, Qin Runqing, and Pei Yunqing of the Money Industry Association. They sought opinions on the collection of income tax and discussed methods for deducting income tax on interest from government bonds and savings deposits. The results were quite satisfactory. It is said that after completing their business in Shanghai, Liang and others plan to return to Beijing today to report.</p>
<p>Invitations for Discussions Today and Tomorrow</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that income tax on bank deposits and government bond interest income will be levied starting on October 1st. The banking and money industries in the city have all taken note of this and are conducting separate studies. The Bankers Association believes that the handling procedures are quite complicated and require sufficient time for thorough discussion. Therefore, the association has recommended Zhang Peishen and others to visit Gao Bingfang, director of the Central Direct Tax Preparation Office, during their trip to Beijing, and also submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to postpone implementation. According to banking sources yesterday, the Ministry of Finance believes that the implementation of income tax has been publicly announced by the National Government and cannot be changed. For the convenience of implementation, it has ordered the Direct Tax Preparation Office to send personnel to contact the banking and money industries. It is reported that Liang Hejun, deputy director of the office, and others have contacted the persons in charge of the Central, China, and Communications Banks and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, requesting the three banks to invite the persons in charge of each bank to hold detailed discussions today and tomorrow in order to start operations on schedule. The banking industry hopes that a practical solution can be decided within one week before the start of operations, so that interest on deposits can be closed on September 30th, and there will be sufficient time to inform branches in various locations to handle the matter simultaneously. The taxes to be collected will be deducted and reported by each bank, and the tax collection office will send personnel to supervise at any time. It is also learned that the deposits in Shanghai banks currently amount to 200 million yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Nationals Considering Payment</p>
<p>Hua Dong News reports that income tax is scheduled to begin on the first of next month. Since the Central government sent personnel to Shanghai, they have been consulting with various parties on the collection procedures. On the foreign national side, leaders of the British, American, Italian, French, and German communities in China have agreed to consider the tax. It is believed that the friendship between China and the aforementioned countries is strong, and that this tax is common in various countries around the world, so they are unlikely to firmly refuse to pay. However, Japanese residents are still protesting.</p>
<h3>Tobacco Industry Association Sends Letter to Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association</h3>
<h3>Opposing Joint Government-Business Agency, Willing to Assist in Tobacco Monopoly, Joint Buying and Selling Agency Will Lead to Complete Demise</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance recently announced its intention to implement a tobacco monopoly and establish a joint government-business buying and selling agency. The Shanghai Tobacco Industry Association believes that joint buying and selling would cut off the livelihood of the industry, so it has urgently requested the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association to assist in requesting the central government to abolish the proposal for joint buying and selling. The original text reads: "Respected Sirs, Our association has long heard that the financial authorities intend to establish a tobacco monopoly. Because it is related to the livelihood of our industry, we have previously sent a letter to your association to forward to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, requesting your assistance in providing relief and protection. On the 28th of last month, the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance convened a discussion meeting for this matter and invited our association to send representatives to participate. According to the Tax Bureau's announcement, the tobacco monopoly has been approved by order of the Executive Yuan, and the general plan is roughly as follows: (1) A joint government-business buying and selling agency will be established with a capital of 5 million to 10 million, half government and half business, or 40% government and 60% business, half Chinese and half foreign. (2) Opinions on market organization and management will be solicited, and merchants will properly plan and implement them. (3) Administrative and business boundaries will be delineated and decided by the preparatory office. (4) The tobacco monopoly will first be piloted with Xuchang tobacco in Henan. At that time, the Tax Bureau also stated that this proposal is a general outline for the monopoly, and the detailed rules are still to be formulated. A preparatory office will be established jointly with tobacco merchants, and if tobacco merchants have any opinions, they can express them in writing in the near future. Our association has held a meeting to discuss this matter and unanimously agreed that the government is organizing a tobacco monopoly to adjust tobacco production and sales, improve tobacco quality, eliminate raw materials for private cigarettes, develop legitimate commerce, and enrich national tax revenue. Our industry should fully support and assist the government in achieving its goals. However, the establishment of a joint government-business buying and selling agency is purely for profit and exceeds the administrative scope of government control and supervision of tobacco. Regardless of the fact that our industry's capital is weak and unable to participate, even if we were able to participate, it would be impossible. Once this business agency with strong capital is established and manipulates the market and prices, each tobacco merchant with weak economic power will inevitably not survive. Even if a few can temporarily struggle to support themselves, they will have no business to operate because cigarette factories that consume tobacco will directly purchase from the company. As a result, our long-established tobacco companies will collapse and disappear due to the establishment of the joint government-business agency, and the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people directly and indirectly will be cut off. Although it is said that the government has no intention of competing with the people for profit, tobacco merchants are in danger of complete demise. How can this be the government's intention to protect commerce and benefit the people? Our industry believes that the government wants to achieve the goals of eliminating private cigarettes, enriching national taxes, adjusting production and sales, and improving tobacco. There are many ways to achieve these goals other than establishing a joint government-business buying and selling agency. If the government leads from above and tobacco merchants assist from below, and work together, there is no reason why it cannot be successful. Based on the above opinions, our association sent a letter to the Tax Bureau on the 3rd of this month, appealing to them to consider the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people directly and indirectly dependent on tobacco, and to abandon the establishment of a joint government-business buying and selling agency. Under the principle of not harming national tax revenue and not harming the interests of tobacco merchants, we will negotiate a solution and cooperate together. We have not yet received a reply to our letter. Because this matter is related to the rise and fall of our industry, and most of our industry are fellow-provincials from Ningbo, we dare to state the process and our opinions to your association. We earnestly request that you consider the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of fellow-provincials who rely on tobacco for a living, and forward the situation to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, appealing to them to protect the livelihoods of tobacco merchants, abolish the joint establishment of a buying and selling agency, and devise other appropriate solutions, always with the goal of achieving both national tax revenue and the interests of tobacco merchants as the best policy. We hope that your association will handle this matter and are extremely grateful."</p>

<h3>Domestic Leather Goods</h3>
<h3>Exports to Be Eliminated</h3>
<h3>Japanese Goods Cater to American Psychology</h3>
<h3>Our Exporters Should Improve</h3>
<p>Leather goods have always been produced in northwestern China and have a wide export market, occupying an important position in export trade. American leather merchants have always sent specialists to Shanghai to be responsible for purchasing. Recently, Japan has realized that leather goods occupy an important position in international trade, so it has sent personnel to various parts of the northwest to purchase in large quantities, slightly select them, and ship them overseas for dumping, which has greatly affected the export market of China's leather goods industry. According to industry insiders yesterday, China's leather goods have recently been unable to gain a foothold in the American market due to Japan's large-scale shipments for dumping. In the past, American leather merchants sent specialists stationed in Shanghai by the Hudson's Bay Fur Company to be responsible for purchasing for convenience, and the annual trade reached more than one million yuan. Later, the styles of Japanese foreign leather, purple lamb, and grey squirrel goods were suitable for the American market, while the quality of Chinese exported leather was considered to be gradually changing, with sizes varying and unsuitable for use, so they switched to purchasing from Japan. However, Japanese goods are all purchased from northwestern China, only slightly selected and shipped to the United States for sale, and they have actually occupied the market, which is surprising. Therefore, if Chinese leather goods operators do not make efforts, they will inevitably be completely eliminated. Regarding grey squirrels, which China used to export the most, American merchants are now purchasing from Russia due to poor manufacturing. It is expected that leather goods exports this year will decline even further.</p>

Therefore, he hopes that the branches can open as soon as possible so that they can recover as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Feng Shaoshan's Report After Returning from an Inspection Tour: Discussing Industry and Commerce in Various Nanyang Regions</h3>
<p>Mr. Feng Shaoshan, dispatched by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to inspect industry and commerce in Nanyang, including Malaya, Lolo, Burma, India, Java, the Philippines, and Annam, has returned to Shanghai. The other day, the Shanghai National Products Promotion Federation hosted a banquet to welcome Mr. Feng, during which he gave a detailed speech on his inspection experiences and the state of industry and commerce in various Nanyang regions. He offered many instructions on the path for Chinese people to strive for in the future. The following is a record of Mr. Feng's speech. Brothers and comrades,</p>
<p>I have been promoting national products for over twenty years. In the meantime, I co-founded the Shanghai Citizens National Products Promotion Association, hoping that the work could proceed consistently without interruption. The motivation for this action was the deep feeling that our country's economy was lagging behind, and to remedy this, it was necessary to start from many aspects, and developing overseas trade was also urgent. Last autumn, I was fortunate enough to be dispatched by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to Nanyang, including Malaya, Lolo, Burma, India, Java, the Philippines, and Annam, to inspect industry. Thereupon, I also took on the mission of promoting national products and developing overseas trade to the overseas Chinese, who all expressed enthusiastic support and cooperation. Today, I originally intended to give a detailed report on the situation in various regions and the above-mentioned actions to everyone present. However, Mr. Lin Kanghou and Mr. Wang Zhixin are here, having just returned from an inspection tour of Lolo, and are more familiar with the current situation there. For other regions, I believe many of you present have also been there. Also, time is not abundant today, so I will briefly talk about two important regions, East and West India, Calcutta and Bombay, and Burma, which will be separated from the Indian government and directly under the British government on April 1st of next year (1937). (A) Calcutta was the capital of British India. Our country has a consulate general there, a Chinese newspaper (called the India News), a party headquarters, various guild halls, a middle school, a Boy Scout troop, and a railway connecting to Darjeeling, and then to Tibet. (Darjeeling is located on the southern slope of the Himalayas, originally Sikkim of our Tibet, and was ceded to Britain in 1835). East of Darjeeling,</p>
<p>there is a place called Kalimpong, which is the main road from India to Tibet. (This area originally belonged to Bhutan of our Tibet and was occupied by Britain in 1865.) In addition, the area can reach the nearby Himalayan foothills of Nepal, Bhutan, Sikkim (also known as Denzong) and three small countries. There are more than 4,000 overseas Chinese in the area, most of whom are engaged in making leather shoes. There were originally more than 300 shoe stores there, all run by our overseas Chinese. Because of religious and class relations, Indians regard shoe making as a lowly occupation and are unwilling to do it, which has invisibly become the exclusive domain of our overseas Chinese. However, in recent years, European merchants, seeing that India has a population of more than 360 million, although Indians are accustomed to walking barefoot as a courtesy and are located in the tropics, not all people need shoes, but the business is also considerable. Therefore,</p>
<p>recently, foreign businessmen have also been thinking about getting a share of the shoe business, which was previously monopolized by overseas Chinese, and have plans to covet the shoe market. They use machines to make shoes, which produce the most. In particular, the Czech Bata company, relying on its strong capital, first established a branch in the area to promote its products, to defeat the shoe stores run by overseas Chinese and seek to monopolize the market. They recruited young Indian children to study in the company. After obtaining considerable experience, they were sent to the Czech Republic for field research. After returning to India, they were given loans to open branches everywhere, selling at low prices. The shoe business of overseas Chinese has been greatly affected. Recently, only more than 200 shoe stores remain, and their future is not optimistic. When I was there, I investigated the shoe stores run by overseas Chinese. The reason why they cannot compete with foreign businessmen and gradually lose money is not entirely due to</p>
<p>foreign businessmen dumping, but also because not only can colleagues not unite, but they also compete with each other, which is also a major factor in self-destruction. Therefore, I gave the local overseas Chinese merchants advice, hoping that they could contact each other and form a public guild. All products from each store must first be sent to the public guild, and the selling price should be determined according to the quality and grade, so as not to reduce prices and compete with each other and be wiped out by foreign merchants. In Calcutta, in addition to the above-mentioned leather shoe industry, which is monopolized by people from Meixian, Guangdong, there are also people from Taishan and Kaiping in Guangdong, who are engaged in the timber industry, as carpenters, and opening grocery stores, porcelain shops, and bars (bars are businesses that operate in wine. They must vote to the government every year, and those who pay the highest amount are allowed to open), and other businesses, but most of them are located in Chinatown. In addition, there are people from Shandong who sell Shandong silk, lace produced in Chaozhou and Shantou in Guangdong, etc. Although the number of overseas Chinese in Calcutta and the industries they engage in cannot be said to be small, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce has not yet been organized. The reason is that factions are divided, and it is not easy to unite, which is a common shortcoming of our people. However, in the near future, I hope it will be achieved, because when I was there, I had several discussions with enthusiastic overseas Chinese leaders in the area. They all believe that it is urgent to organize. When I was there, the lace merchants among our overseas Chinese, after my persuasion, immediately organized the Preparatory Committee of the Calcutta Lace Industry Association. By analogy, the Calcutta Chinese Chamber of Commerce will soon be established and will seek welfare for our overseas Chinese. (B) Bombay is an important commercial port in Western India. Its commerce can reach the Kashgar province of India (on the border of Xinjiang in our country) and Balochistan, Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Persia and other countries. Our country has a vice consulate, party headquarters, schools, and other institutions there. The population of the area is 1,157,851, slightly less than the 1,419,321 in Calcutta, the city of East India, but it is the second most populous city in India. There are more than 1,000 overseas Chinese there, most of whom are from Taishan and Kaiping in Guangdong. Chinatown also has grocery stores and restaurants. In the Indian Muslim Quarter, there are overseas Chinese who specialize in silk and groceries from Guangdong, with an annual turnover of 3 million yuan (Indian Rupees). They have also organized a commercial and sports club. In recent years, because business in India has improved compared to before, hundreds of people from Shandong have been returning to the port one after another. Most of them take ships directly from Shanghai to their business locations and specialize in Shandong silk and Chaozhou and Shantou lace and fine cloth from Guangdong. The people of Lu are strong and able to endure hardships. They carry large packages on their backs every day and sell them in the inland villages by bicycle. Bombay now has the Shandong Fellow Association. The chairman and vice chairman who preside over the association are very good people. When they hosted banquets to welcome me and when the overseas Chinese compatriots held a general assembly to welcome me, I tried my best to encourage them to love the country and the community, especially the fellow association, which should hold a meeting one day of each week, to advise everyone to do the duty of a great nation and not to show any shortcomings that would be despised by other countries. Moreover, when doing business in the interior, they should be familiar with the commercial situation, pay attention to courtesy, and sell genuine products at fair prices. They agreed with me very much. (C) Burma is bordered by Siam to the east, the Bay of Bengal to the south, and the province of Assam in India to the west. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at Hongxing Hosiery Factory: Mediation Again: Principles Submitted to Director for Review</h3>
<p>The Hongxing Hosiery Factory on Caishi Road in the French Concession experienced a labor dispute due to a conflict between employees and female workers. Although the party and government agencies persuaded them to make a four-point decision, the factory was deeply afraid of further disputes and has not implemented it. To eliminate the dispute, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau summoned both parties to the bureau again yesterday afternoon at 2 pm to formally implement mediation. Li Weixiong from the Municipal Party Department, Wang Shui (represented by Zhang Chuqiang) from the Social Affairs Bureau, Ge Suisheng and Le Shunting representing the capitalists, Zhang Zhuyun from the Second District Knitting Industry Union representing the labor, and Zhi Weixin from the factory's union branch were present. After both parties stated their opinions, the labor demanded that the factory follow the four principles set by the Social Affairs Bureau. The capitalists could not agree to this from beginning to end, so the mediation still yielded no results. Then the chairman of the committee said that these principles would be determined after the director has reviewed and approved them.</p>
<h3>General Office of the Aviation Association: Office Affairs Meeting: Aircraft Donation for Birthday Celebration Naming Ceremony Scheduled Around Double Tenth Festival</h3>
<p>The General Office of the Shanghai City Solicitation Team of the China Aviation Association held its 77th office affairs meeting at its office the day before yesterday (19th) at 2 pm to discuss the fundraising guidelines. Those present were Chief Executive Li Dachao, Cadres Zhang Yuliang, Zhou Songhe, Zhang Peihu, Ji Jimin, Zhang Xiamin, Zhou Nanjiao, Huang Jun, Ji Huiran, Zhu Shengyang, Song Zheng, Gu Shangrui, Wei Jianxin, Chen Shuo, Liu Songtao, etc. Li Dachao was the chairman, and Chen Shuo was the recorder. The chairman reported, in brief, that the solicitation team of this office had ended at the end of August. Some team members have left Shanghai or are busy with official duties, so the triplicate receipt books and solicitation documents they received have not been fully returned. After sending letters to urge them separately and sending personnel to contact them, the work of completing the procedure has been very busy in recent days and can be compiled and announced soon. The results of collecting aviation national salvation funds from various industries are still good, and there are no special circumstances. However, the collection from the restaurant and bar industry started in February this year. Collection committees were set up by various gangs in the industry at Fuxing Lane on Sima Road. Now, for the convenience of contact, it has been moved to Room 312 on the third floor of the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge and the collection is still going on as usual. The movement to purchase aircraft for birthday celebrations in this city has received enthusiastic support from all parties. It is now scheduled to hold an expanded publicity campaign to purchase aircraft for birthday celebrations from the 22nd to the 27th of this month. This seat, in accordance with the instructions of Mayor Wu, has stipulated methods and is responsible for planning, including special issues in newspapers, slogans, notices to various organizations to strive to donate, airplanes scattering leaflets, radio stations broadcasting, cinemas showing Chairman Chiang's portrait, and the significance of purchasing aircraft for birthday celebrations, arousing the public's attention and enthusiastically donating. As for the aircraft donation for birthday celebration naming ceremony, it will be held around the Double Tenth Festival. The naming of each aircraft is being negotiated and prepared separately. Also, the film industry is planning a large variety show of male and female stars, which will be performed at the Jincheng Grand Theater on the 27th, with comedy, singing and dancing, magic, drama, Peking opera, etc. Tickets have been sold and are crowded, which shows the enthusiastic support of the public. This association should assist in increasing achievements, etc. Then, after the external affairs cadres reported on the progress of the negotiations, a number of fundraising plans were discussed, and then the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>National Election Office Scheduled to Issue Seafarer Citizen Certificates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal National Assembly Representative Election Office issued Announcement No. 30 yesterday regarding the issuance of citizen certificates to the members of the China Seafarers' Union. The announcement stated that the members of the China Seafarers' Union have already taken the citizen's oath. It is now scheduled to issue citizen certificates on the 25th and 26th of this month.

<h3>Tobacco and Grocery Industry Demands Supplementary Bonuses for Gu Ben Soap: Based on Wholesale Practices, Each Six Pieces to be Replenished</h3>
<p>Since the launch of Gu Ben Soap, self-made by the Wuzhou Pharmacy in this city, patriots have been eagerly promoting it. However, the most capable promoters are the tobacco and grocery stores. Recently, the Family Invincible Soap, Xiangmao Soap, and Mi Soap have emerged to compete, but the sales of each soap are still the highest for Gu Ben Soap. Because the shareholders of the Dacheng Company, the manager of the soap, have very good relations with various tobacco and grocery stores, they are all willing to promote sales and sacrifice prices. They also contact various tobacco companies to replace gifts with Gu Ben Soap when exchanging empty shells. Therefore, the number of sales is increasing day by day. It is now learned that Xiangmao Bai Mi Soap has added investigators to investigate the procedures of the industry in the city. The procedure has been completed, and samples of soap and advertisements have been distributed door-to-door, encouraging the stores to promote sales in a unified manner. For every ten boxes sold, one box is added as a gift. In addition to promoting and displaying the soap in major companies, tobacco and grocery stores also account for seven tenths of the sales. However, the Dacheng Company, which manages Gu Ben Soap, has only supplemented six Gu Ben Soaps per box at the old price for large wholesale companies since August. No supplements are given to small companies. The small companies believe that the Dacheng Company's treatment is unfair, and they have repeatedly sent people to the company to request a supplementary gift of soap, but they have been rejected. Later, after Shen Weiting, chairman of the Tobacco and Grocery Industry Association, and committee members Qiu Tanglin, Mi Chuxin, and Chen Kunxian, negotiated with the company again, there were still no results. The stores in the industry are now writing letters to the association one after another, continuing to ask the chairman and committee members to request a supplementary gift from the company to maintain their business.</p>

<h3>Smuggling Morphine into the US Case: Associate in Shanghai: French National Stai Commits Suicide: Massive Overdose of Narcotics, Resuscitation Ineffective, Dies: No Explanation of Morphine Case Inside Story</h3>
<p>Stai, the Chief Accountant of the Baolong Hospital in this port, who was related to the case of Ms. Wen Mali privately transporting morphine into the United States, was fired by the hospital director after the case was revealed, and then declared missing. Although the three police authorities in this port issued arrest warrants, they were not successful. Now, he has also died, following the suicide of Mr. Branderstetter, the leader of the private drug trafficking ring. At 7:30 the night before last night, a Chinese person passing through a field somewhere on Xujiahui Road saw a foreigner lying under a tree. At first, he thought he was drunk and fell to the ground, or it was caused by a sudden illness, so he immediately reported it to the patrolling police on duty. The police sent him to a nearby Russian hospital for treatment. When the police station heard the news, they sent investigators to inspect and found that the person was indeed Stai, who had disappeared. He was unconscious due to an overdose of narcotics. The doctors tried their best to resuscitate him, but he died at 9:45. Although he temporarily regained consciousness before his death, he was unable to explain anything about the private smuggling of morphine by Ms. Wen Mali. Stai was 50 years old and was from Alsace, France. He must have committed suicide out of fear of crime in his hiding place the night before last night and was found lying under a tree after taking the drug. It is said that a French passport was found in his pocket, as well as ten dollars in paper money. Whether there are other exhibits, the people in the police station do not want to reveal it now, because they believe that there are other leaders of the private drug trafficking ring hiding in Shanghai and plan to arrest them, fearing that the news will leak and cause inconvenience. Although Stai lived in Shanghai for about 20 years and had a small house, he usually lived in seclusion and had no friends. French overseas Chinese in this port did not know him. Even the French Consular Office and the police station did not know him. He served in the Binlong Hospital, lived in a small room, and did not go out easily, so he was very trusted by the director. It was unexpected that he would be the leader of a private drug trafficking ring. Now his body is still stopped at the autopsy place, and it is heard that an autopsy will be performed to see what kind of drug he took to die.</p>
<h3>Failed to Buy an Official Position: Allegations of Collusion and Fraud: Blocked from Taking Office Twice: Security Deposit of Several Hundred Dollars Lost</h3>
<p>Jiang Gongding and Ding Huian, (resident at No. 10 Mao Yili, Meimen Road, Shanhai Pass) from Changzhou, were previously deceived of their security deposits for seeking the position of Chief of the Tobacco and Liquor License Tax Inspection Office in Chuansha County. They sued Cao Shanxiang, former director (resident at No. 5, Lane 141, Dasheng Hutong, Haig Road), Li Shiyuan, director's wife, Wang Zhiliang, incumbent director (resident at No. 30 Yuzhen Lane, Malang Road), and Gao Ruirong (resident at No. 3 Junyili, Er'jin Road) for collusion and fraud in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. It was alleged that in February of this year, through the introduction of his friend Ding Huian, he met Gao Ruirong. According to Gao, his friend Cao Shanxiang was the Chief of the Tobacco and Liquor License Tax Bureau of Shangdou, Taijia, Chuan, and other counties. If he wanted to seek the position of Chief in Chuansha, he only needed a security deposit of several hundred yuan to succeed. At that time, Ding was idle, so they jointly raised 900 yuan, stating that the position of Chief would be handled by Ding Huian and Gao Ruirong. After the procedures were completed, Ding and Gao took the money to the bureau for negotiation the next day. Director Cao Shanxiang was out on business, so Director's wife Li Shiyuan accompanied them to the First District Tobacco and Liquor License Tax Bureau on Fusantang Street, Nanshi. Li Shiyuan ordered Ding and Gao to hand over the money to her, and the bureau issued a receipt, instructing them to go to the bureau on the 13th to collect the appointment letter. When the time came, they obtained documents such as stamped official documents and went to the Chuansha County Government. The head of Jin Section met them and explained that the director had been replaced, and Cao Shanxiang had been dismissed and replaced by Wang Zhiliang as the director. Later, after repeated negotiations with the new director, Wang Zhiliang, the incumbent director, agreed to seek a job for him, but he had to add a security deposit. At that time, he paid 200 yuan in cash and a promissory note for 450 yuan. After completing the procedures, he went to Chuansha again to take over the job. The head of Jin Section of the County Government said that the bureau had been ordered by the Department of Finance to be merged into the Business Tax Bureau, etc. The defendants' behavior was clearly collusion and fraud, requesting that they be interrogated and dealt with according to law. The court accepted the lawsuit and issued summonses several times. Because the first defendant Cao Shanxiang lived in Nanjing and the summons could not be delivered, the court requested the Capital Court to arrest Cao and transfer him to the Second Special Court. Yesterday morning, presiding Judge Zhang Minsheng interrogated him in the Second Criminal Court. Because the other defendants had not been summoned, only Cao Shanxiang was questioned. He claimed that the security deposit was not handled by him, and he gave evasive answers. The court adjourned the hearing and summoned the defendants to appear in court for further interrogation.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Tram Company Bans Vending on Trams to Avoid Disturbing Public Order</h3>
<p>General factories and businesses in Shanghai employ salespersons to promote their products and sell their goods along various roads or on trams to boost sales. Recently, the practice has become widespread, resulting in vendors peddling various goods on every tram at all times. It is reported that the Shanghai Tram Company, considering this sales behavior a disruption of public passenger order, has immediately issued a ban and has painted a warning in white paint on the trams stating, "No goods of any kind are allowed to be sold on the tram." Consequently, the number of vendors selling goods on trams has decreased in recent days.</p>
<h3>National Touring Troupe Arrives in Shanghai, Expanding Solicitation of Sponsorship</h3>
<p>The New Safety National Touring Troupe, which departed from Huai'an last autumn and passed through Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Pukou, Bengbu, Wuhu, Anqing, and other places, has recently arrived in Shanghai under the leadership of Mr. Zai Dazhi and is temporarily residing at Yuying Elementary School on Route Cardinal Mercier. Yesterday, a rural society reporter visited the leader and received the following statement: "Our troupe is organized by a dozen or so young people around the age of fifteen. The purpose is to make society our school. Since our departure on National Day last year, we have spent ten months passing through more than a dozen cities and towns, encountering various difficulties, but we have overcome them all. Our goal is to learn and forge strong character while focusing on how to help those people who have fewer opportunities to receive knowledge than we do. The national crisis is serious. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said, 'We must awaken the masses.' Facts tell us that this work is very important. This time, we have come to Shanghai to learn essential knowledge and skills during the summer vacation while organizing everything from the past and discussing future plans in detail. Therefore, there is a need to expand our plan. We have decided that our subsequent itinerary will take us through Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces with developed highways. Therefore, there is a need to prepare our own large automobile. This large automobile will be our school and the school for the people in the places we pass through. Automobiles are modern means of transportation. We must acquire driving knowledge and skills. We must first acquire the tools. This is beyond doubt. We will make our best effort to achieve our goals. To make our work more effective during the trip, we deeply feel the pain of having insufficient or unsuitable tools. The total value of the required books, tools, and supplies is about four or five thousand yuan, which is a very large sum. How can we manage to do it? However, the ancient saying goes, 'Many little bits make a coat, and many hands make light work.' To hope for the success of our plan, we can only make our request, collect widespread sponsorship, and think that the elders and young friends who are enthusiastic about us creating new lives will surely give us great strength in sponsorship and guidance. Regarding the methods of soliciting sponsorship, there are: (1) Sponsoring with materials, such as a three-ton automobile, a 16mm projector, a 16mm movie camera, and a five-power telescope, etc.; (2) Sponsoring with cash, regardless of the amount; (3) Exchanging with advertisements, such as factories, shops, or cultural and academic institutions, entrusting with advertisements or properly arranging for inland work to exchange for materials or cash. It is heard that they will set off at the beginning of next month, first to Hangzhou, and then to Anhui, Jiangxi, and other places for travel."</p>
<h3>Abortion Due to Impending Marriage Leads to Tragic Death: Wang Lanying Regrets Her Actions; Wang Long's Family Released on Bail Pending Trial</h3>
<p>Wang Lanying, a twenty-year-old woman from Anhui who worked at the Tongxing Yarn Factory on Route Woosung, was betrothed by her parents to someone from a young age. Unexpectedly, the woman had an affair in Shanghai with a fellow villager named Chen, and after several encounters, she became pregnant. Now, her husband's family has selected an auspicious date to welcome her into the family. Her mother, Wang Long, came to Shanghai to bring her daughter back to her hometown so the marriage could take place. But with the date fast approaching, there was no way to get rid of the fetus in her womb. On the 12th of this month, the mother and daughter went to room number 18 of the Yong'an Hotel on Route Shuntak. The daughter went to a certain place on Yangtszepoo Road and hired a midwife surnamed Li to perform an abortion, agreeing on a fee of fourteen yuan. At 7 PM that evening, Ms. Li went to the hotel and performed the procedure, using a bamboo chopstick to insert it into the woman's vagina. By the 15th, the mother saw that her daughter's condition had worsened, so she accompanied her to the Huxi Hospital at 115 Route Maignan. The doctor diagnosed that it was caused by an abortion and reported it to the Zhabei Police Station. Detective Wang Qishan was ordered to investigate. The woman was transferred to Guangren Hospital for treatment. Although the fetus was aborted, the woman's condition worsened and she died at 2:25 PM on the 20th. The detectives suspected Wang Long's family of assisting in the abortion and took her to the police station for custody. The midwife had fled upon hearing the news, so there was no way to arrest her. Yesterday morning, Ms. Wang was sent to the First Special Court. Judge Huang Risheng held a hearing and ordered a postponement for further investigation. Ms. Wang was released on bail to be available for questioning. Around 10 AM, prosecutor Zhang Zongru, accompanied by medical examiners Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, went to the morgue on Route Frelon to examine the body. After examination, it was determined that the deceased Wang Lanying, female, had died due to illness caused by an abortion during her lifetime. The body was temporarily entrusted to Puji Villa for embalming, pending the release of her mother, Wang Long, on bail.</p>
<h3>Liu Huizhi and Others Accused of Embezzlement; Trial Begins; "Flying Over the Sea" Gains Over 20,000 Taels of Gold; Over 10 Million in Transactions with "Hengji Account"</h3>
<p>Liu Huizhi, the current managing director and former manager of the China Industrial Bank, and Li Jizhi, were criminally prosecuted by the bank's shareholders Zhang Chongfu, He Jiechun, and others to the First Special District Court for allegedly embezzling and defrauding the bank of millions of dollars. Because the plaintiffs' claims in both cases were largely the same, the court decided to consolidate the cases for trial. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Chuan Lin held a hearing. He first stated that the handling judge had been transferred, so the case must be re-examined. The plaintiff's lawyer, Chen Tan, then presented the indictment, first detailing the content of the accusation of fraudulently raising the stock price of the Beijing Waterworks Company. He stated that the stock was purchased for a price of more than 33,800 yuan. The defendant then suddenly raised the price to more than 50,200 yuan, paying one side to the account of the China Industrial Bank and collecting the other side to the account of Gongshunji. Although the defendant claimed that the name Gongshunji was the incarnation of the bank, the plaintiff knew that it was the defendant's alias. The defendant only spent a moment transferring the account and embezzled more than 20,000 taels of bank funds. This kind of fraudulent method is called "flying over the sea" in accounting terms. After this procedure, even money can fly into the pocket. In court, the defendant Liu Huizhi was asked how he defended this accusation. Liu stated that the name of the Gongshunji account had been approved by the board of directors, and the accounts recorded therein were confidential and could not be disclosed to outsiders. The stock price was raised because there was hope of selling it at the time. Although it was not sold later, I have repeatedly transferred the account to prevent the bank from suffering losses. Lawyer Chen then recounted the accusation of fraudulently establishing the Hengji account name to embezzle. He stated that the defendant initially denied this.</p>
<p>The name of the Hengji account, and it was not until the plaintiff investigated and found that Hengji was affiliated with the Hengshun Trust Company founded by the defendant, and presented various evidence, that he claimed that Hengji was the account name of Jia Yangshan. In fact, the Hengshun Company was run by the defendant, and Hengji was not the account of Jia Yangshan. The previous record of the Hengshun Company's resolution, which was retrieved, contains the record that Liu Huizhi once represented Hengji to attend the shareholders' meeting. However, the loopholes in this resolution record are obvious. The most obvious ones are: (1) The color of the thread used to bind the book is clearly different in newness from the color of the cover. (2) The Qingyunge Bookstore, which sold the Chu book, has a red stamp with fifty pages on the back, but when counted, there are only forty pages, and ten pages have been torn off. (3) There are still remnants left where it was torn. All these points should be given extra attention. In addition, the shareholder register and shareholder general ledger of Hengshun Company do not have the name of Liu Huizhi, but Liu has already admitted that he is a shareholder of Hengshun and has paid 10,000 yuan for the shares. Under what name did he subscribe for the shares? It should be investigated. Hengji was the account that received cash from the China Industrial Bank that year, receiving 40,000 yuan every day and using 14.4 million yuan every year. With such a huge amount of transactions, how could the defendant not know who Hengji was? This point needs to be thoroughly investigated. Judge Chuan then stated that the case was complicated and that the evidence that needed to be investigated was very numerous. He then postponed the trial to another date.</p>
<h3>Route 17 Trolleybuses Will Extend to New Routes; Service Expected to Begin Mid-Next Month</h3>
<p>Route 17 trolleybuses, which run north-south through the British and French concessions, originally ran from Route Kunming in the British Concession to Route Zikawei in the French Concession. The route will now be extended to Dapu Bridge at the end of Route Père Robert. After the service begins, the bus will turn from Route Tsai Shi into Route Conty, pass through Route Siccawei, and go to Dapu Bridge on Route Père Robert. However, this will not affect traffic on Route Zikawei because the Route 18 bus terminates there. This extended route is not very long and will significantly shorten the distance between the Central District and the southwest area of the French Concession. The power lines are currently being laid, and service is expected to begin in mid-next month.</p>

It is reported that the repair project is progressing rapidly and can be completed by the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Wife Unfaithful, Contract Signed for Sale; Paramour Unable to Pay Flees; Servant's Criminal Complaint Dismissed</h3>
<p>Xu Yandi, a servant residing at 91 Route Tenant de la Tour, French Concession, is over thirty years old. His wife, Jiang, named Azong, is about the same age. They have a son and a daughter, the daughter is twelve years old this year, and the son is five years old. Unexpectedly, Xu's wife, Jiang, was restless and had an affair with Weng Shaocong, a colleague residing at 33 Route de Zikawei near Xu's house. They had been secretly having an affair for some time. After Xu discovered the adultery, Xu and his wife, Jiang, agreed to divorce. The two parties signed a written agreement, agreeing that the two children would be led and raised by Xu. On one side, Jiang was sold to Weng Shaocong as his wife, and Weng compensated Xu for the loss. The two parties signed another contract. Because Weng was unable to pay the money for a while, he signed another document and gave it to Xu for safekeeping. Later, Weng and Jiang Azong lived together. They were still unable to pay Xu's losses and repeatedly delayed the payment. Recently, they fled together. Xu then hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Jiang Azong and Weng Shaocong of interfering with marriage, requesting investigation, and attaching a civil complaint to seek compensation for the loss. The court, according to the complaint, held a hearing yesterday by Judge Chen Shuoying. The two defendants were unable to be summoned and did not arrive. Only the plaintiff, Xu Yandi, and his lawyer arrived and recounted the previous requests. The court verified the words and stated that since the two parties had signed a contract, they should file a lawsuit with the civil court, which did not involve criminal matters. The court then announced that Jiang Azong and Weng Shaocong were not guilty.</p>
<h3>Shoe-Shining Service Group's Work Progressing Smoothly; Shoe-Shining Revenue for the First Eight Months of This Year is Considerable, Totalling Over 1,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The shoe-shining service group established by the Christian relief organization of the Moore Memorial Church on Tibet Road has been in operation for more than a year. The latest situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>Working Condition</p>
<p>When the group was established last year, there were a total of twelve service members, all of whom were trained by the former general secretary, Ye Fanggui, and then sent to various barber shops, hotels, and amusement parks, such as Dagongming Barber Shop, Datong Hotel, and Tianyunlou, to provide services. Later, General Secretary Ye Fanggui (pastor of Moore Memorial Church) was also transferred by the church to Suzhou to serve. The executive committee of the group reported and requested that Committee Member Zhang Qifu take over. Because the service members have the sympathy of people from all walks of life, their work is also very convenient. Recently, Mr. Zhang resigned due to certain reasons, and the group affairs will be presided over by someone appointed by the executive committee.</p>
<p>Shoe-Shining Revenue</p>
<p>Regarding the work results from January to August of this year, the group reported the following yesterday.

<h3>Yang Yinhai, Conning with Fake Diamond Ring; Pawnshop Employee Already Deceived Once; Unexpectedly, Yang Scams Again</h3>
<p>Yang Yinhai, a 29-year-old man from Zhenjiang residing at 4 Daokaw Lane Street, Nanshi, Huajie, has been dealing in Western-style jewelry. On the evening of the 18th of this month, he held a Western-style imitation diamond ring and asked the Guanglifeng pawnshop at No. 235 Xizilaihuo Street, at the corner of Route Tsai Shi, French Concession, for 80 yuan. The pawnshop employee, Shen Changnian (32 years old, local), looked at it under the light and saw that the diamond was beautifully polished, estimating that its value was in the hundreds of gold. He did not realize that it was a fake, so he pawned it for the amount. After closing the market, he matched the goods and found out that he had been deceived and could not pursue the matter. He could only regret his bad luck and compensate the store for the principal. Unexpectedly, Yang was not satisfied and on the evening of the 20th, he held another similar fake diamond ring, slightly larger than the previous one, and still went to the pawnshop to ask for 150 yuan. Pawnshop employee Shen Changnian pretended to deal with him and secretly sent an apprentice out the back door to report to the French police station. Detectives rushed to the scene and took Yang and the two fake diamond rings into the police station. It was found that the fake diamonds were made of Japanese zircons, and they were indistinguishable from real diamonds under the light. After interrogation by the police chief, Yang was taken into custody. Yesterday, he was sent to the Criminal Court 8 of the Second Special Court for interrogation by Judge Sun Penghuan.</p>
<p>The Police Department's lawyer, Chen Ming, explained the case and requested a postponement of the investigation to determine whether the defendant had committed other crimes, so that they could be prosecuted together. The investigating officer presented the fake diamond ring to the court. The plaintiff, Shen Changnian, then explained the situation of the defendant mixing fake diamond rings twice. The court verified the report and interrogated the defendant. Then, it was ordered to postpone the investigation to the 24th and detain the defendant.</p>

<h3>Craftsman Hires a Car to Kidnap Someone; Arrested</h3>
<p>Yesterday (21st) at 11:30 AM, a Xiang Sheng Company taxi with Concession license number 18527 and City license number 4727 was parked in front of the Bethel General Hospital at 169 Route Tenant de la Tour, south of the Eight Immortals Bridge, French Concession. Three men who looked like craftsmen were standing beside the car, all wearing short clothes. After a while, a young woman in her twenties, wearing a black silk cheongsam, walked out of the hospital. The craftsmen immediately stepped forward and put the woman in the car that was parked in front of the hospital with ropes. The woman shouted for help, and the patrolmen found out, went forward to inquire. One of the craftsmen stepped forward and told the police that the woman was his wife, who had run away from her husband and disappeared without a trace. Now he had finally found her, so he forced her to go home for a reunion. The police thought that the craftsman should not hire the army to kidnap people in broad daylight, so they took the men and the car to the Great Bell Police Station for verification.</p>
<h3>True Self-Disciplined Buddhist Monk</h3>
<p>Master Puqin, originally from Rongchang County, Sichuan Province, with the surname Pan, came from a charitable family. When the Master was young, he wanted to become a monk and practice, but his parents did not allow it. He secretly escaped to Leixi Temple on Mount Emei and took the Venerable Daming as his teacher. As soon as he became a monk, he thought of ending his life and escaping death, and did not learn chanting, but specialized in practicing, widely speaking Buddhist scriptures and studying Buddhism. He previously pricked his tongue and wrote the Lotus Sutra, the Diamond Sutra, the Amitabha Sutra, and other scriptures in Chengdu, countless times. He went south to Putuo to worship the pagoda by burning his fingers at Yuzhou Temple and writing two parts of the Lotus Sutra in blood for twenty-three years. He was taught secret teachings by Venerable Rongzeng of the Bodhi Society. Later, he wrote the Avatamsaka Sutra in blood in seclusion at the Haihui Zen Temple with the Venerable Ci Fa, and forgot to speak for a year, specializing in Esoteric Buddhism. He also burned forty-eight lamps on his body and mind. One of the lamps was as large as a teacup mouth. He spent the whole night sacrificing his life to the Buddha and managed to escape the danger. The lamp marks gradually healed. On June 19th of this year, he made offerings to the Buddha and burned twelve lamps on both sides of his back, and wrote the Avatamsaka Sutra in his tongue blood. Every morning, he bled half a cup, and wrote from 6:00 AM to 4:00 PM without feeling bitter. His tongue was not damaged, and his spirit was as usual. On July 15th, he held a large lamp-burning ceremony, making offerings to the Buddha and the monks, benefiting people and gods, and praying for world peace. He felt the diligence of the monks and laity, and more than 30 disciples who converted to the Buddha burned lamps and incense. He is a true ascetic monk of Buddhism.</p>

<h3>Sun Shengtang Sues Zhang Amao for Coercing a Written Agreement and Fraudulent Acquisition of Money; Defendant Claims it was Compensation for Adultery Case; Ye Foukang to be Summoned as a Witness</h3>
<p>Sun Shengtang, a Ningbo native residing at No. 1, Jishen Lane, Kangding Road, Shanghai West, whose son, Sun Yushu, is a bus ticket seller, recently hired lawyer Qu Shiji to file a lawsuit in the local court, accusing his son's colleague, Zhang Amao, of coercing a written agreement and fraudulently obtaining money. Yesterday, Judge Lu Hongyi opened the court session. Sun Shengtang testified that he is 52 years old. On the 15th of this month, at 10 AM, the defendant, Zhang Amao, brought a policeman from the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau to the plaintiff's home and arrested his son, Yushu, claiming that Zhang Amao's wife, Zhang Liu, had committed adultery with Yushu, and that Zhang Amao had reported it, hence the arrest. He waited until evening but did not see him return. He went to the bureau to inquire, but as soon as he reached the entrance, he was seen by Zhang Amao, who came forward and recounted the situation, then persuaded him to sit in the household registration room of the bureau. Finally, Zhang Amao, along with several others, rebuked him and prevented him from leaving, stating that in the case of Sun Yushu's adultery with his wife, they had hired lawyer Ye Foukang, costing 300 yuan, which should be compensated. Otherwise, he would not let the father and son return home, and ordered his accomplices to guard the exit. Faced with this precarious situation, and being outnumbered and intimidated, he was persuaded by accomplices to mediate. He was forced to write an agreement for 220 yuan, which Zhang Amao took before he was released. Therefore, he requested legal action. The defendant, Zhang Amao, testified that he is 29 years old, a Ningbo native residing at No. 439 Kangding Road. Sun Yushu and he lived in the same room and were formerly colleagues. He discovered that Yushu had an affair with his wife, and on the 12th of this month, he reported the situation to the Caojiadu branch bureau. On the 15th of the same month, the police bureau ordered the police to arrest Sun Yushu. After interrogation, Sun Yushu's father and friend Jiang Mingdong and others repeatedly persuaded him to reconcile at the branch bureau and agreed to compensate him for the 220 yuan in lawyer's fees, and a written agreement was made. He requested investigation, stating that there was no coercion or fraudulent acquisition of money. At this point, lawyer Qu stated that since the defendant had hired a lawyer, he requested that the lawyer be summoned to court for cross-examination. The court ruled that the case should be investigated further after summoning lawyer Ye as a witness.</p>

<h3>Luan Cup Singles Semifinals: Sun and Hou Stalemate, Each Winning One Set, Match to Continue Today</h3>
<p>The Luan Cup singles tennis tournament held by the Kangdi Club has progressed smoothly since its start. It has now reached the semifinal week. After Luo Qiren defeated Zai Shuzi in three sets of six to one the day before yesterday to win the final, the match between Hou Shangxiong and Sun Yaodong also started yesterday. Hou Shangxiong is one of the mainstays of the Kangdi Club. His tennis skills are sharp and agile. Sun Yaodong is known for his抽[chōu, a tennis technique] and is also good at volleying. He is also the highest contender for the championship. The two heroes met yesterday. Hou Shangxiong had a smooth first set, winning three games in a row. Unexpectedly, Sun Yaodong steadily pressed forward, surpassing him with a score of four to one. Then, each person's opening game was broken, resulting in a stalemate. In the end, Hou finally won the first set with a score of eight to six. The second set was even more intense. One game followed another, with alternating leads. The exciting waves made people unable to take their eyes off them. In the end, Sun Yaodong's long抽[chōu, a tennis technique] was successful, and several high-pressure shots were particularly impressive. He won the first set back with a score of eleven to nine. At this time, the autumn colors were evenly divided, and the atmosphere of the battle became even more tense. The third set was stalemated for a long time, with equal scores repeatedly. Until the sky was dark, it was still unresolved. After calculating the efforts, the score was still tied at five to five. Although they planned to continue and end this set, they were hindered by poor visibility. Therefore, both parties agreed to count each winning one set and disregard the five to five score in the third set. The match is scheduled to continue this afternoon to determine who will win the final. As for the final, which was originally scheduled to be held today, it is now too late and will have to be postponed. The date of the postponement has yet to be decided.</p>

<h3>National Conditions of the Population in Northwest China: Central Government Subsidies for Compulsory Education Expenses. Shaanxi Has the Highest Population Density and the Most Enrolled Children.</h3>
<p>Among the provinces in the Northwest region, including Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Suiyuan, and Ningxia, Shaanxi has the highest population density. The Wei River and Han River basins have fertile land and a mild climate, so residents are concentrated there. In the northern areas of Yulin, Suide, Dingbian, and Baoan, the land is semi-desert and the climate changes drastically, so the population is sparse. The population density of Gansu is second to Shaanxi. Huixian County, Chengxian County in the southeast, and Gaolan in the west are the most densely populated areas. In the northwest, in Anxi, Dunhuang, and Yudu counties, sand accumulates and production is limited, so the population is relatively sparse. Near the Hetao area of Suiyuan, branch canals crisscross and the land is fertile, so the population is densely populated. The farther away from Hetao, the sparser the population becomes. Ningxia is located in the southeast of the Yellow River basin and belongs to the loess layer, which is suitable for cultivation, so residents mostly gather here. The Ruo River basin in the west is affected by groundwater, and plants also grow. People mostly live in tents along the coast. Apart from this, most areas are barren and sparsely populated. In Qinghai, the eastern areas of Xining and Huangyuan are densely populated. The northwest of Yushu is sandy and the climate is unpredictable, so residents are scattered. The southeast of Xinjiang is a desert area with few products and a very sparse population. The areas north and south of the Tianshan Mountains are relatively densely populated, followed by the southwest. In the entire northwest region, Xinjiang is probably the province with the sparsest population. The population of the Northwest, the average number of enrolled children per thousand people, and the amount of compulsory education funds subsidized by the central government in the 25th year are listed below:</p>

<h3>Securities: Many Swap Transactions; Government Bond Market Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation of the Chinese Securities Exchange was entirely determined by different supply and demand. Swap transactions and associations have been delegated to rise and fall, and generally do not have an associated relationship with environmental conditions. With only three days remaining for delivery, although the number is small, there is still some slight squeezing, and the trend is stable. Even the hopeless 96 issue has been raised by about 10 cents, and has broken through the 10 yuan mark again. With the battle line shortened, offense and defense will not be flustered, so there is such an extremely calm attitude. The market opened slightly confused yesterday, and gradually trended upward after entering, rising by 10 to 20 cents compared to before. In the second session, retail short sellers, seeing no hope of recovery, made sporadic compensations, and swaps were more abundant, resulting in another 10 to 20 cents increase. The market sentiment is that no one dares to short sell. Therefore, the afternoon opening continued to be firm by about 10 cents due to short covering swaps. The closing only saw slight declines of 5 to 10 cents for one or two types of bonds, and Grade A bonds rose by another 10 cents. This month has reached 69 yuan. The market price resulted in an increase of 10 cents to 35 cents. The total transaction volume was 4.87 million yuan. The results of its gains and losses are compared and listed below. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Unwilling to Take in Stagnant Goods; This Month's Yarn Feels Even More Sluggish; Forward-Date Brokers Slightly Firmer in Taking Positions</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rebounded at noon, but the trend this month remains sluggish. This is because there are many who have a lot of floating profits and are unwilling to take delivery, coupled with rumors that there are some stagnant goods, which are even less welcome, so the market situation is even more virtual, breaking through the 200 yuan mark. However, the situation for forward-date current yarn is good, and brokers are firm in pulling up prices. However, the overseas yarn and cotton market is gradually becoming flat and fatigued.</p>
<p>Near-Term Approaches the 200 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the traded yarn market, prices continued to decline for each month. This is because the delivery period for this month is approaching, with only two business days remaining. There are rumors that thousands of bales of arbitrage yarn must be delivered without a doubt. It is said that the sales of this type of traded yarn are very sluggish for a time. Therefore, the market condition this month is even more virtual, breaking through the 200 yuan mark. Forward-date yarn is dragged into the vortex, but some brokers, seeing that the stored yarn is less than before, are still inclined to be bullish. However, there are still over 26,000 bales of chips in the warehouse, and Yu Da (裕大), Tai Xing (泰興), Ming De (明德), Wang Tai Xing (望泰興), Da Chang Cheng (大昌成), Chang Feng (長豐), etc. have sold a lot. Only Geng Feng (賡豐), Chang Ji (昶記), Tong He (同和), and Xin Cheng (信誠) have bought in slightly. As a result, this month fell by 1 yuan and 20 cents compared to the closing price of the previous day, and the far date fell by 40 to 50 cents. In the afternoon opening, there was still retail selling of this month, and the far date rose by 40 to 50 cents. It was found that Ju Xing (聚興) sold 1,600 bales, Yu Da 2,400 bales, Ming De 1,100 bales, Wang Tai Xing 1,000 bales, Da Chang Cheng 3,500 bales, Chang Feng 1,000 bales, Heng Chang (恒昌) 900 bales, Yong Chang (永昌) 800 bales, Run Kang (潤康) 700 bales.

<p>Spot Yarn Prices Show Mixed Gains and Losses</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are still good. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 1,000 bales throughout the day, and the selling prices showed mixed gains and losses of 50 cents. The purchase amounts of each gang are listed below.</p>
<h3>New Cotton Supply Gradually Increases; Traded Cotton Market Momentum Dampened; Rumors That Old Cotton in the Exchange Has Been Sold at Reduced Prices</h3>
<p>The cotton market is calm, and the momentum is weakening. This is due to favorable weather conditions, which are of great benefit to cotton picking, coupled with the unfavorable trend of American cotton. Fortunately, the Indian cotton market is relatively expensive, and the listing of new cotton from various sources is gradually becoming abundant.</p>
<p>Far-Month Contracts Each Fall by About 10 Cents</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the traded cotton market, market discussions mostly looked favorably on it, saying that the old cotton collected by the exchange in the August contract has been sold at reduced prices and sold to a certain cotton firm, which has been transferred to factory roots, etc., totaling more than 50,000 dan, of which 10,000 dan are coarse fleece cotton. However, although the bulls were active when the first lot opened, the momentum was still dampened. This is because the weather has been favorable recently, and new cotton is in the midst of an abundant flood, coupled with the unfavorable trend of American cotton, all months broke through the 12 cent mark. There is hope that the supply from various sources will gradually increase, and the market still lacks excitement. Cheng Ji (澄記), Chang He (長和), Ju Xing, Da Ji (達記), Ming De, He Xing (合興), Yi Cheng (義成), and Da Chang Cheng all sold, while Yu Kang, Zhen Da (振大), Rui Da (瑞大), Xing Chang, Sen Kang Xie Cheng (森康協成), Tong He, and Yi Kang (益康) bought traded cotton. As a result, each month fell by 5 cents to 20 cents compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon opening was ordinary, falling by 5 cents to 10 cents. The first round was flat, and the third round jumped up by 10 to 20 cents due to the rebound in the yarn market, and the market became slightly dry. The closing was still firm. As a result, each month rose by 5 cents to 10 cents compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Chang He sold 9,000 dan, Da Chang (大昶) 9,600 bales, Geng Feng 3,500 dan, Sheng Yuan (生源) 1,500 dan, Da Chang Cheng 1,300 dan, Yi Cheng 3,000 dan, Da Ji 1,200 dan, Ju Xing 2,300 dan, Cheng Ji 2,400 dan, Da Fu (大孚) 3,400 dan, Yu Da 2,500 dan, Fu Kang (福康) 2,800 dan. Ren Feng (仁豐) bought 2,700 dan, Shen Ji (慎記) 2,500 dan, Xing Chang 2,000 dan, Sen Kang 1,700 dan, Shen Chang (慎昌) 1,500 dan, Yu Kang 2,200 dan, Run Kang 2,600 dan, Jin Chang 1,800 dan, Tong He 1,400 dan. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>New Yao Cotton Arrivals Are Increasingly Abundant</p>

<h3>Prices of Three Types of Yarn and Cotton Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Osaka telegram on the 21st: The price of three types of futures yarn fell by 70 cents to 1 yuan and 60 cents, with the near-month contract at 213.5 yuan and the far-month contract at 202.9 yuan. The price of futures cotton fell by 60 cents to 90 cents, with the near-month contract at 263.75 yuan and the far-month contract at 63.65 yuan.</p>
<h3>Indian Cotton Harvest Is Still Considered Good</h3>
<p>Last week, Bombay cotton did not follow the rise in American cotton, so the recent foreign market situation has not been good, and this place has not been affected much. Although the demand for cloth has improved, factory purchases of cotton have not increased. There has been some trade with Lancashire and the mainland. Japan has purchased Pingguoer (平果爾) and Aomura (奧姆辣) cotton. The cotton harvest is generally smooth, but in some cotton areas, the quality has been lost due to excessive rainfall.</p>
<h3>Grains: Spot Goods Smaller Than Standard; Flour Bulls Released, Market Suddenly Strong</h3>
<p>The flour market opened in the morning, and there was a slight resistance at the beginning of this month, showing a slight stability. However, the news from foreign wheat was that Liverpool fell by a little over one penny, and the actual sales went down without developing. Moreover, the opening price of spot flour was a few cents smaller than the standard, so people's hearts were going down. After October, it trended downstream. The bulls for this month became more and more lax in their intention to take delivery. In the second session, the market suddenly became strong, taking the same steps as the far-month contracts. However, external investors were not very interested in coming in, so it was still lively to take the opportunity to collect. Therefore, after the third session, gains and losses were mixed, and it was in a state of hovering all the way. As a result, compared with the closing price on the weekend, this month fell by 1.5 cents, October and November each fell by 1.25 cents, January fell by 1 cent, and December and February each fell by 0.5 cents.</p>
<h3>Floating Bulls Sell Back, This Month's Wheat Suddenly Down by 4 Cents</h3>
<p>The futures wheat market opened in the morning. As the delivery of this month was approaching, and the quoted price of foreign wheat fell, floating bulls, who had no intention of taking delivery of actual goods, took advantage of the situation to sell back, and the market suddenly fell by 4 to 5 cents. Later, as the price of flour fell, the purchase of far-month contracts also hesitated, and each month fell by 2 to 3 cents. In the afternoon, in the spot wheat transaction, although the Fu and Fu factories (福阜兩廠) did not make any advances, it was said that Japanese merchants had sold 300 tons of wheat from Bengbu and Wuhe (蚌埠五河) at 5.05 yuan. The market sentiment turned stable, and the transaction was light, so there were no major changes in the afternoon market. The total price for the whole day was lower than the weekend. This month fell by 4 cents, November fell by 1 cent, January fell by 3 cents, February was unchanged, and October and December each fell by 2 cents.</p>

<h3>Sesame Exports Decrease Greatly in August</h3>
<p>According to the report of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, sesame exports in August totaled 6,281.60 metric tons, a sharp decrease of 41,169.26 metric tons compared with 47,450.86 metric tons in the same month last year. The total export volume in the first eight months of this year was 504,852.80 metric tons, which was also a decrease of 112,071.42 metric tons compared with the same period last year. As for the reason for its decline, it is generally due to the decrease in international consumption, the abnormal stagnation of European sales, and the quite sluggish situation in American markets. Although Japan and Italy have a strong desire to import, the overall calculation is still not as strong as last year. It is not optimistic about the export of sesame this year. The comparison of sesame export volume in August with the same month last year is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Merchants Purchase Over 10,000 Packages of Unpolished Xian Rice</h3>
<p>In recent days, customer xian rice has been arriving in an endless stream, ranging from 8,000 to 9,000 packages to over 20,000 packages per day. The arrivals were still abundant in the past two days, and the accumulation is increasing day by day. The market seems to have a gradual downward trend. However, yesterday Guangdong merchants purchased unpolished xian rice extremely actively, and over 10,000 packages of unpolished jing rice and other varieties were traded. Shantou, Beiyang, Tianjin, and Ningbo merchants in this street all responded. However, the price of machine-milled rice has recovered slightly by 40 to nearly 100 cents due to the strong arrival and storage of both. However, the market for unpolished xian rice is still flat due to the active purchases by Guangdong merchants. However, people's hearts are also softening again. Throughout the day, 4,220 packages of Jiangxi rice and 12,500 packages of Hunan rice were offered, and there were no other imports or exports.</p>
<h3>The Road to River-Bottom Rice Is Still Clear</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of 24 to 25 shipments from various sources arrived, totaling more than 5,000 stones. The sales market in this street has always been sluggish. Although the sales volume was 500 to 600 packages, they all selected high-quality goods, resulting in the stable price of the thin paddy rice market, which is rarely special, and the rest fell by 100 to 200 cents. The thick early japonica rice relied on the rare arrival to barely maintain its price. The Dongxin factory's goods were in short supply and maintained the original market. River-bottom rice was reduced by 100 to 200 cents. The new Reed Point rice was also the same when it arrived in abundance, and the price was lower by 100 to 200 chi. Ocean Point rice was also soft, and Yin Yuan was flat.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 37 to 38 shipments from various sources arrived in River-Bottom. The sales of various goods in the market were sluggish, including broken japonica rice, thin paddy rice, new customer point rice, and old sheep point rice.

The price of Bai Yuan Dongxin japonica rice was flat.</p>
<h3>New Sesame Selling Price Is Firm; Soybean Trend Is Also Stable</h3>
<p>New sesame arrivals continue, and the Eastern Ocean gang continues to purchase. The retail market in this street and those who are gathering to make foreign goods are not weak in their desire to buy, so people are optimistic, and the goods owners are tightening up, resulting in sparse market transactions. It is estimated that more than 150 packages of Shashi sesame, 75 packages of Dangshan sesame, and 5 packages of Nanjing sesame were offered. The market price has not changed. The foreign merchants opened for trading, and 300 tons were opened on Saturday night, with the price being 11.9 yuan. Yesterday, there were 100 tons at 11.95 yuan, and then 12 yuan, but the transaction did not go through. The soybean trend is quite stable. The oil extraction plant is not slacking on its soybean demand because the price of soybean oil is on the rise and the cake market is stable. Yesterday, 1,200 to 1,300 packages of early yellow soybeans from Hankou, 200 packages of Qingjiangpu soybeans, and more than 100 packages of Yaowan soybeans were purchased. Other southern routes such as Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Shantou, Guangdong gang, and this street are all inquiring, and a total of 2,400 to 2,500 packages of various soybeans have been traded.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Yarn and Thread Firmly Rise, Cotton Cloth Becomes More Popular; New Transactions in the Yangtze River and Henan and Shandong Are Booming; Hakka Merchants Need to Place Orders Early</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was still good, and the demand for spot goods from various sources increased daily. Although the current trend of traded yarn and cotton is flat, the current yarn and thread are firm and scarce, resulting in an increasingly prosperous market for cotton cloth, white goods, and colored goods. Spot goods are greatly panicked, and Hakka merchants are placing orders in advance and waiting for distribution, otherwise it will be difficult to obtain them. Yesterday, Guangdong gang and other factories continued to purchase more than 300 pieces of thread tweed, fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, straight tribute, and serge. Other southern routes, such as Yunnan and Fujian gangs, also had a strong desire to buy, and each traded more than 200 pieces. However, some replenishment goods are temporarily difficult to trade due to shortage and price increases. The new transactions of Sichuan and Tianjin gangs are rare, but the loading is still large. The new transactions and loading of floral flannel, white flannel, blue cloth, colored twill, thread tweed, floral plain straight tribute serge, and satin are all extremely prosperous along the Yangtze River and in Henan and Shandong inland. The market for each goods continues to be good. Xin Yu (新裕), Zhen Tai (振泰), Da Sheng (大生), Bao Xing (寳興) and other factories increased the price of heavy coarse cloth by 5 cents per piece, and the price of colored thread tweed also increased by 5 cents per code.</p>
<h3>Sales of Woolen Fabrics Are All Smooth</h3>

The sales of straight tribute, serge, Walter tweed, Hailing tweed, Hailisi, Shi Pao Tuike Si (師泡推克四), Ping Hou tweed (平厚呢), yellow tweed, Melton, herringbone tweed, breeches tweed and other types were all extremely prosperous for a time.

<h3>Silk and Tea: The Autumn Cocoon Harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Is Not Good; Silk Prices in This City Are Rising Very Quickly; However, the Transaction Has Stopped Due to the High Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in this port was rising due to the poor harvest of autumn cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Manufacturers are also holding on and unwilling to sell easily. It is learned that the cocoon price in Wuxi is between 27 and 28 yuan, while the price in Hangzhou is around 33 and 34 yuan. The other areas, such as Yixing, are roughly the same as Hangzhou. The manufacturer's asking price for the Shanghai white factory's Ching brand 202 grade raw silk has risen to 640 to 650 yuan. The price of Tian Tai Luo Bin Han (天臺羅濱漢) grade is 660 yuan, and the price of Feng Que Shuang Hu (蜂鵲雙虎) grade is about 670 yuan. The asking price for export silk delivery should be increased by about 15 yuan for foreign firm expenses before the transaction can be completed. Due to the rapid rise in prices, transactions have stalled. The foreign firm's silk market is even more deserted. Only a few sold yesterday from the user side. For example, the Zebra brand white factory's selling price was 667.5 yuan, which was an increase of 17.5 yuan compared to last week.</p>
<h3>Precious Eyebrow Green Tea Sales Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firm's green tea market situation was still quiet. Only the Tong Fu (同孚), Tian Xiang (天祥), Jin Long (錦隆), Yong Xing (永興) and other firms in the city bought precious eyebrow shrimp eye and other green teas, totaling more than 370 boxes. The selling price of precious eyebrows was 105 yuan, and the selling price of shrimp eyes was 53 yuan, which was unchanged from last week. The other needle eyebrow and show eyebrow goods are all trending flat. The Qimen black tea is still under negotiation yesterday. Judging from the current situation, the entire Wang Yu Tai (汪裕泰) is still promising.</p>
<p>According to the report of the Tea Industry Association, the green tea market is still quiet. The telegraphs for the previous week's selling of precious eyebrows and other products to foreign countries by various firms failed to get a response yesterday, Monday, so the transactions were extremely rare. However, Bai Tou's (白頭) purchase of Gong Xi (貢熙) was still active, with hundreds of boxes of transactions continuing. Tong Fu (同孚) and Xie He (協和) each purchased dozens of boxes of Tunxi and Suian (遂安) precious from extraction. The selling price was slightly worse than before. The big group of American firms had no transactions of Pingshui tea for a long time. Yesterday, Jin Long (錦隆) began to disassemble and handle five groups after receiving a call from the buyer, all of which were mid-to-lower grade pearl teas. The selling price was still similar to before. The market situation was slightly more active than last week.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: 10,000+ bags of Dutch coarse white arrive</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable and beautiful. The association's price for 24 coarse sand white was 21.55 yuan for spot goods and 6.6 yuan for transit goods. Dongbai 489 remained unchanged. The prices for local factory's refined white, Jinxin (金心), Dahua (大華), and No. 1 were all 20.5 yuan, and the rest were refunded. Guangchao (廣潮) gang offered more than 500 bags of Hainan red at 14 yuan, a rise of 10 to 20 cents. Huanggangqing (黃崗青) dozens of bags at 14.5 yuan, and Jian (建) gang offered 700+ bags of Diaoqing (刁青) at 13 yuan, a rise of 20 cents. 16,452 bags of Dutch coarse white, Shanzhisha (山芝沙), and Danny (丹尼) were imported and transported in.</p>
<p>The cooperative company held its first tender for Guangdong coarse white of the week yesterday, with a total quota of more than 9,000 bags. The bidding price was as before. 1,480 bags of Shunde factory's Five Rams (五羊) coarse white, and another 10 bags from Quxi factory were sold at 21 yuan. Another 1,000 bags from the Shixin factory were sold at 21.2 yuan, and another 205 bags of medium sand white were sold at 19.3 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Belgian Factory Strike; White Lead Sheets Increase in Price Frequently</h3>
<p>The price of white lead sheets has been rising in recent overseas telegrams. According to investigation, the reason is actually due to the strike in the Belgian factory. The most arrivals of white lead sheets in this port are Belgian goods. Although Germany, Poland, and other countries also have arrivals, the number is very small, so Belgian goods are the most popular in the market. Recently, due to the fact that Belgian orders must be changed to be shipped three months later, it is inevitable that the inventory in Shanghai will be out of stock in the future. The standard has risen sharply. The current market transaction is also more than before. The factory side is deeply afraid that there will be a shortage of goods in the future. It was found that a total of four or five hundred bundles were sold in the past two days, and the market price has increased by two to three yuan compared to before. For example, No. 2 is sold at 152 yuan per bundle, No. 3 at 140 yuan, Nos. 4 and 5 at 130 yuan, Nos. 6 and 7 at 127 yuan, and Nos. 8 and above are sold at 125 to 128 yuan. According to the recent observation of market sentiment, it is feared that the market price will not be easy to loosen for a while.</p>
<h3>Statistics: Overview of Tung Oil Export and Output in August: Exports Decrease Sharply - Domestic Sales Are Booming</h3>
<p>According to the report of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, tung oil exports in August totaled 3,128.56 metric tons, a decrease of 4,590 metric tons compared with 7,719.04 metric tons in the same month last year. The total for the first eight months of this year also decreased by more than 25,000 metric tons compared with the same period last year. It can be seen that tung oil exports this year are declining day by day, and there is a tendency to get worse. The sluggish sales in the UK and the US have almost led to this.</p>
<p>Domestic sales of tung oil this year, on the other hand, have shown progress. For example, the efforts of Qingdao, Yantai, Tianjin and other groups have been unusually active. Therefore, compared to the total number of exports from Shanghai to various ports in the first eight months of this year with the same period last year, it has increased by 5,000 metric tons, almost doubling the total number compared to the same period last year, an increase of about 5,000 metric tons, almost doubling the giant. The booming output in August shows that the future is promising. The quantity of tung oil for export and domestic sales in August is listed in two tables below.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Yi Mei)</p>
<p>Confine a phoenix with a cage, restrain a tiger with idleness; the city imprisons crowds of people.</p>
<p>Looking at paintings is like buying a mountain, appreciating flowers is like taking a concubine.</p>
<p>The sound of the xiao is fitting under the moon, appropriate before the flowers.</p>
<p>The begonia severs the heart, the azalea stains the blood; who says flowers and birds are without feelings?</p>
<p>In the quiet of autumn nights, keeping one or two autumn insects in a vase or pot, their faint sounds are most helpful to my writing inspiration.</p>
<p>A person who can spend half a lifetime in leisure is a god.</p>
<p>Rather that my relatives and friends are all poor while I am rich alone, I would rather that my relatives and friends are all rich while I am poor alone.</p>
<p>Common people conduct themselves in the world by regarding trickery as the only way.</p>
<p>Having adorned the face while going against the heart, and blocking the eyes to prick the ears, what more can be said about such an environment?</p>
<p>The ugliness of people is often exposed by gold.</p>
<p>Wealth is the enemy of elegance, therefore elegant scholars are mostly poor. Longevity is the enemy of beauty, therefore beautiful women all have short lives.</p>
<p>Passing a festival while away from home, listening to the sound of rain on an autumn night, makes one want to call out, but what to do?</p>
<p>The monthly rose, grown in this country, can have its petals picked and boiled as a tea substitute to regulate women's menstruation.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that lotus petals placed in books can prevent bookworms. It is said that they can also cure rotten feet; regardless of whether they are new or old, apply several to the affected area, and they will naturally heal day by day.</p>
<h3>Shoes... Scepter... Robe</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Tinglin of Kunshan's "Remaining Shoe," one shoe, has been treasured in the Gu Ancestral Hall in Qiandun Town. Even now, I still remember more than twenty years ago, when the Pingquan Studio opened a calligraphy and painting exhibition on Chengdu Road, Gu's descendants brought it to Shanghai for display, along with a handwritten copy of "The Book of Benefits and Harms to the World and the Nation." Only Gu's shoe was exceptionally large, and all who saw it were amazed, thinking that the feet of the wise men of the past had a different scale, then the greatness of his trunk and limbs could be imagined even more.</p>
<p>Gui Youguang was also from Kunshan. When he was young, discussing books, his grandmother loved her grandson deeply: one day, passing by his study, she said, "My son, I haven't seen your shadow for a long time, why are you silently here all day, just like a maiden?" After leaving, she closed the door with her hand, saying to herself, "My family's reading has not been effective for a long time, can the success of this child be expected?" Soon after, she brought an ivory scepter, saying, "This is what my ancestor, the Taichang Duke, held during the Xuande period to attend court; one day, you should use it." This was what Xifu himself said, but I don't know if his descendants can still preserve this ivory scepter now?</p>
<p>Also, Gu Dingchen, a grand secretary of the Ming Dynasty, whose great-grandson moved from Kunshan to thirty miles southeast of our county, to a place called Factory Head; his family treasured a court robe, one and a half times the length of a person, and a record-keeping scepter, about two feet tall, which they would respectfully offer every spring and autumn for sacrifices: now I don't know where it has ended up. Reciting the poem by Mr. Yang Zixiang of Doushan, "The grand secretary's career has melted like ice, the robe and scepter drift away, lamenting the past dynasty; before the ancestral hall of the prime minister, turning my head again, my heart is ashamed, and wine is hard to wash away," it makes one unable to stop sighing.</p>
<h3>Ginkgo</h3>
<p>— Damu</p>
<p>Ginkgo, commonly known as white fruit, has very tall trees, with dense branches and leaves like an umbrella. It is best to enjoy the cool under a ginkgo tree in the summer, and the biggest advantage is that it doesn't have spiny caterpillars and wild silkworms falling on people like other trees. The fruit is about the same as an apricot, with yellow skin. Removing the outer flesh, the white shell inside is the white fruit. Normally, white fruits are knocked down from the tree, and the outer flesh is left to rot, because it is easier.</p>
<p>It is not easy to find ginkgo trees in Shanghai; Bansong Garden, Zhaofeng Park...don't have any, right? Ginkgo trees are indeed difficult to grow. Often, those planted by grandfathers may not have white fruits to eat by the time the grandsons are around. However, Shanghainese do not have to worry about not having white fruits to eat. When the autumn wind first rises, the sound of people selling white fruits on the streets appears. The sentences are really like lyrics, listen: "Hot white fruits, fragrant, glutinous and soft, white fruits bigger than goose eggs, one copper coin for three, two copper coins for seven, come and count if you want to eat, pick and pass if you don't!"</p>
<p>According to a friend, these words for selling white fruits can be sung as a qingyi flowing plate, the words of course need to be added or subtracted a bit. Upon further reflection, there is a small discovery. For example, where are there white fruits as big as goose eggs! The peddlers insist on shouting "goose egg big," which is clearly a deception. In fact, in this big Shanghai market, unrealistic publicity fills the ears, and the peddlers' few words of description are already considered honest. Moreover, two copper coins can get you one cheaper, which is an even more "realistic" preferential treatment.</p>
<p>There are two ginkgo trees at the back door of my uncle's house in my hometown. When I was sixteen in my hometown, they were five or six arm spans around. In the past eight or nine years, I imagine they have grown even thicker. However, I recently heard that they were forcibly bought at the lowest price by the old local gentry in the village, on the grounds that they hindered the feng shui of his new building and were sawed down. The gentry's mind is so ridiculously pedantic, and my impoverished uncle was deprived of the only remaining "ancestral blessing" for no reason, which is too pitiful.</p>
<p>From my uncle's ginkgo trees, I also thought of a tragic "social news" from a few days ago. A peddler who borrowed "usurious money" to sell white fruits was killed when the local hoodlums from Jiangyin Street demanded money and didn't get it, kicking his own child to death... The path of life is full of thorns. Writing about ginkgo here, I suddenly feel gloomy...</p>
<h3>Bottomless Pit</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>Swapped Mandarin Ducks</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 6: An Iron Face Meets a Kind Heart, Words Deceive the Parrot; Delicate Eyebrows Harbor Chivalry, Pledges Question Kunlun</p>
<p>Youmei said: "You misunderstood my meaning. I'm not saying you've done anything immoral. But we live in this era, and we can't be like women of the past, letting others control our life's happiness and being family slaves for a lifetime. If you have this intention, and there is social sympathy for you... no, no, I shouldn't have said that. If there's social sympathy for you, how would you even know? My words came out very casually, and your question has left me unable to justify myself." As Youmei said this, her cheeks flushed purple. She sat down and kept folding a small piece of white paper on the table. Menglan looked at her and said, "I might as well tell you the truth. My marriage was arranged from a young age, and it's been a fact for over a decade now. If I were to overturn it, it would cause a great upheaval. My parents love me very much, and I would break their hearts. But I also understand that we can't sacrifice our entire life's happiness to preserve the family's reputation. But I'm also confused, whether it's because I've been poisoned by old books or by religious ideas, I simply don't have the courage to resist the oppression of the old ethics. For this reason, I hate myself for being useless. Reason and emotion are in constant conflict, making me like this Lin Daiyu-esque girl. In fact, that kind of frail, sick creature from scholarly families isn't worth us emulating. As for people in society who sympathize with me, as you mentioned, perhaps there are..." She paused, then continued: "But I don't know where these people are." As she spoke, her expression was serious, but a slight smile appeared on her cheeks when she said that last sentence. Youmei laughed and said: "Those are words from the heart. But as long as you believe there are such people in society, there's no need to worry about it. If there is such an opportunity..." (77)</p>
<h3>On Discussing Opera</h3>
<p>— Mingxin</p>
<p>The recent rise of Hebei Ping Opera in Shanghai's theater scene can be said to be unexpected. In the past, there were actors like Bai Yushuang and Furonghua, but now there are the sudden emergence of Zhu Shixia and Zhu Zixia. It can truly be said to be the golden age of Ping Opera. Drama is also a form of art. In addition to providing enjoyment, it also has the mission of influencing customs and habits. Therefore, the selection of material must be cautious, and the wording must be carefully studied. It should aim to win the sympathy of the general audience from an artistic perspective without being offensive. Only then can it be considered top-notch. In other words, it can also be considered an artistic success. In the past, performers focused on charming appearances and vulgar language, which was undesirable. After watching, it left a bland aftertaste, which caused criticism from the general public and also affected the future of Ping Opera as a whole. Recently, Zhu Baoxia and Zixia have been performing at the Great World, with full houses day and night. I happened to go and watch a performance last night and deeply felt that the skills of the Zhu sisters were indeed extraordinary. Their body movements and appearances were commendable. Their articulation was clear, every word was powerful, and their expressions were even more subtle and detailed. Whether angry or happy, they were just like the characters in the play come to life. The wording was elegant and poetic, and their ability to avoid vulgarity in their charm was truly commendable. The reputation they have earned is indeed not accidental. It is hoped that the Zhu sisters will continue to work hard and not be swayed by bad habits, and reverse the decline. Then, there will be great hope for the future of Ping Opera.</p>

<h3>Autumn Outside the Writing Room</h3>
<p>— (Man)</p>
<p>Outside, it is drizzling, and a gust of wind blows the rain threads dancing wildly in the air, making the entire sky grayish-white. The little bird in the cage is just chirping, perhaps feeling that autumn is too bleak and frightening. In the courtyard, there are a few short banana trees, and a few red flowers are still there, pitifully withered by the wind and rain, without any vitality.</p>
<p>I sit in the office, leaning over my desk, constantly moving the abacus beads, holding a spirit of service, unwilling to show the weakness of a woman. Men and women are equal, where is my weakness as a woman? Suddenly, I feel a shiver running down my spine. I look up and glance out the window, ah! How bleak is autumn! Wind and rain! Keep falling and blowing away all the heat and annoyance.</p>
<p>Looking back at my colleagues, each of them is buried in their writing, forgetting spring, forgetting summer, and forgetting autumn. For the sake of life, they have abandoned nature. No, please put down your pens and look outside, autumn will give you a profound feeling!</p>
<p>Small Local Chronicles</p>
<h3>Casual Talk about Beihai</h3>
<p>— Nailing</p>
<p>The Beihai that this article is about is not the Beihai in Beiping, but a small trading port in the Southern Circuit of Guangdong Province. I'm afraid that readers have never heard of this small trading port before? However, since the Beihai Japanese Residents Incident occurred, it has been featured in the newspapers every day, and the name Beihai has become less unfamiliar.</p>
<p>What kind of place is Beihai actually? Well, let me tell you: Beihai is a small trading port with only a few straight and a few horizontal roads. Although this small trading port is a rather important port in the Southern Circuit of Guangdong, with large cargo ships sailing to Hong Kong, Guangzhou Bay, and Haiphong almost every other day, a pier where ships can dock has not yet been built to this day. Ships arriving from Hong Kong anchor far out at sea, and passengers and cargo are transported to land by small sampans.</p>
<p>When Beihai was first opened as a trading port, elders said that it was a very promising port. In addition to the specialties of Hepu and other places near Beihai and the nearby villages, such as seafood, bird's nests, sandworms, piglets, grass bags, etc., which were exported through the port of Beihai, the specialties of Guangxi Province and the specialties of Qinzhou and Leizhou were also concentrated in Beihai and then transported out. At the same time, flour, groceries, etc. imported from Hong Kong were mostly transshipped from Beihai to Hepu, Qinlei, and even Guangxi Province. Even the trade between Beihai and Haiphong in Annam used to occupy a very important position, but since Wuzhou in Guangxi was opened as a trading port, most of the goods imported and exported from Guangxi no longer needed to be transshipped through Beihai. On the other hand, the production volume of various specialties has decreased, and the market in Hong Kong has been hit by goods from other places. For example, in the past, cargo ships sailing from Beihai to Hong Kong were always loaded with piglets, but since Dalian pork was dumped in Hong Kong, the piglet business in Beihai has been affected. As a result, the commerce of Beihai has declined sharply, and it has also affected the construction of municipal administration. If we searched all over Beihai, there would probably only be thirty or forty old-fashioned crank telephones, and there wouldn't be many cars either. Not to mention the roads, there is probably only Zhuhai Middle Road in Beihai that is sixteen feet wide.</p>
<p>Beihai is located in the southwest of Hepu County. Hepu County is a famous pearl-producing area. The Hepu of "The Pearl Returns to Hepu" is here. Hepu still retains a "Dongpo Pavilion", which is said that Su Dongpo once lived in Beihai and Hepu for some time.</p>
<p>The languages of Beihai and Hepu are mostly Cantonese, with the exception of some Hakka dialects; however, it differs somewhat from Cantonese in Guangzhou. Speaking of cultural life, it is a bit too "that." After searching all over Hepu and Beihai, only one Hepu County Middle School was found. This middle school is located in the northeastern suburbs of Beihai City. The architecture is not bad, and the affiliated library can also be accessed by outsiders for reading; but when the author returned to his hometown to visit his family three years ago, there was not even a newspaper office in the Beihai area.</p>
<p>The lives of farmers in the Beihai area are very difficult, so most of the sons and daughters of farmers in Qinlian run out to become soldiers. Chen Mingshu and Xiang Hanping, famous generals in Guangdong, are from Hepu County, and Chen Jitang, who recently stepped down, is from Qin County. As for the lower-level officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army, almost more than half of them are from Qinlian. In the past, the recruitment of troops in various units in Guangdong all went to Qinlian, which had a large number of surplus farmers. Another reason is that the people of Qinlian are able to endure hardship and are able to obey. Recruiting people from Qinlian to be soldiers is most suitable.</p>
<p>However, the people who come to Qinlian to recruit soldiers often also use deceptive means. For example, the recruitment office sends local ruffians and hooligans deep into the villages to win over the general young farmers. These farmers are falling into a state of idleness because of the economic downturn in the countryside. The ruffians and hooligans pretend to be fond of them and encourage them to gamble and prostitute themselves. At the same time, they also lend them money to use. After a considerable period of time, they use force to force them to repay the debt. They often have no way to repay the debt, so they use the means of enticement and coercion to force them to agree to become enlisted soldiers.</p>
<p>These enlisted soldiers are transported from various villages to Beihai, and then transported from Beihai to Guangzhou for training, but some of them regret it halfway. They do not want to leave their hometown, so they have to take the opportunity to escape. The author once personally witnessed a person who was unwilling to board the ship to Guangzhou in Beihai. He hid in the hold of a sailboat, and later jumped into the sea after being searched. As a result, he was shot in the head by the officers on the ship with a pistol, and the blood that flowed out dyed almost the entire sea red.</p>

<h3>The Authority of the Chef (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Huang Yiqing</p>
<p>You must know that fire is the only tool that the chef uses to earn a living. Anything that is eaten must be cooked to perfection with proper heat; utensils used for serving food must be exposed to sufficient heat to ensure hygiene; and cloths used for wiping utensils must be thoroughly sterilized with heat. From the perspective of disease-causing organisms, your greatest authority is that you are the executioner who directly uses fire to kill them. If you are careless and negligent, they will be happy to take advantage of it, and you will become a traitor who condones disease-causing organisms in harming people. Of course, on the one hand, overcooking food can reduce the digestibility of proteins. For example, overcooked eggs are naturally less digestible than lightly cooked ones. However, as a chef, you should be skilled at cooking food, knowing how to cook it just right, how to cook it until well done, and how to cook it to perfection. You should be able to master these skills through practice.</p>
<p>You must also know that "cleanliness" is the only "selling point" of a chef. If your person, hands, and fingernails are not clean, your appearance will not be good. If the knives, spatulas, ladles, pots, and other utensils are not cleaned properly, your appearance will not be good. If the rice, fish, meat, vegetables, and other raw foods are not washed clean, your appearance will not be good. If raw foods are not purchased fresh and clean, the appearance of the food will not be good, which means your own appearance is not good. If cooked foods are not properly protected and are exposed to flies, dust, and dirt before being eaten, it is all because of your poor appearance. As Wu Lefu said, not having "face" is for this reason. From the perspective of disease-causing organisms, your greatest duty is that you are the watchman who is responsible for preventing them from breaking in. If you are muddled and negligent, and your defenses are lax, then don't blame them for tearing down your stage! Cleanliness is not the same as hygiene, and there are indeed many aspects to hygiene. However, from a chef's perspective, it can be said that cleanliness is always hygienic or close to hygienic.</p>
<p>However, further, when a chef seasons food, the flavor and intensity must be tailored to the taste of the host or customer. The allocation, preparation, and protection of food cannot be entirely under the chef's control. For example, if the host only likes to eat meat and does not like green vegetables, or if the customer prefers fried dishes and does not eat stir-fried or stewed dishes, then in addition to fulfilling their duties to the best of their ability, chefs must also rely on the host and customer to "help themselves" and make wise choices. In families, the housewife who manages the household affairs must have this kind of common sense and ability to direct. How many large families hire chefs to cook their food? In most families, the housewife must personally handle everything in the kitchen, large and small. In a small number of families, even if they hire servants, the housewife must be careful every step of the way and train them thoroughly before they can be "in tune." Then I must always ask: In recent years, has the general education of women in our country provided in-depth training in such practical knowledge and skills? I'm afraid that even now, this is still something that those who advocate reforming education should think about supplementing.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more point that is worth noting. If a chef has tuberculosis, venereal disease, or leprosy, it is easy to know that they should not be hired. However, if they appear to be healthy on the outside and are "clean," but are secretly a permanent, temporary, or intermittent carrier of fecal-oral or droplet-transmitted diseases, how dangerous is that? According to the author's speculation, in the future, when hygiene has reached its peak, not only will the chefs in restaurants everywhere be subject to public health examinations at all times, but also the chefs hired by families will have to add a clause to their contracts stating that a certain "great doctor" has signed a certificate proving that the person is not a carrier of any disease before people dare to hire them. Employment agencies may have to imitate the meat inspection in slaughterhouses in Europe and the United States, and hire experts to reside in the agency to inspect for bacteria and viruses and sign certificates of health before people dare to use them! When hiring chefs or servants now, you should at least ask if they have had cholera, typhoid fever, dysentery, diphtheria, pneumonia, meningococcal meningitis, etc. recently, and you should choose those who have not had these diseases to hire, to avoid mistakenly hiring automatic carriers after illness (I can't think of a good way to deal with those passive carriers).</p>
<p>The Nanjing Health Education Committee held a training class for school chefs last year. It is hoped that this kind of committee can expand its authority to manage the health education of the public and hold more general training classes for chefs, cooks, or housewives. It is also hoped that various places will follow suit.</p>
<p>Also, the Nanjing Municipal Health Office seems to have established some kind of model kitchen. If it is indeed considered simple and practical and can be promoted nationwide, it is hoped that the contents of this model kitchen can be announced so that everyone can follow suit or observe some of the concepts that a kitchen should have.</p>
<h3>Investigation Report on the Sanitary Conditions of Xiaoshi, Zhejiang (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Shen Songnian</p>
<p>Although Xiaoshi is a small town, it is located on the main road of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, and water and land transportation is developed early, and the townspeople are accustomed to fashion, and their lives combine luxury and simplicity, but the people's wisdom is very low, and various sanitary facilities cannot be realized as scheduled, which is very regrettable. As a result of the continuous efforts of the authorities over the years, a rough scale has been achieved, and it can be said to be unique compared to the remote rural areas, but it is still far behind the big cities! ——This is of course a very big morbid state, and there are reasons for it, and it cannot be entirely blamed on the ineffectiveness of the sanitary authorities. It is simply a case of "a clever woman cannot cook without rice," but the educational community and our medical community should also bear a considerable responsibility, which is undeniable. Now, based on my limited knowledge of the general sanitary conditions of Xiaoshi, I summarize a few points below, which can be regarded as a reference for the sanitary authorities to improve:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding Medical Administration</p>
<p>(1) Siltation of City Rivers</p>
<p>The Xiaoshi market is not yet prosperous enough to have a tap water plant, and the drinking water needed by the residents in the city center is entirely supplied by the city river. Although public wells have been established, they are only a drop in the bucket. Once the river water is shallow and dry in the hot summer, it even ferments and emits a foul odor. Pedestrians cover their noses. It is the main base of all kinds of germs, which hinders hygiene more than anything else. Therefore, it is advisable to find a way to dredge it, because it is not only related to the drinking water of the people, but also hinders fire prevention. It is recently heard that Mr. Wu Xinmu, a local gentry and captain of the fire brigade, and others specially convened a meeting to discuss the dredging plan. If it can be realized as scheduled, it will be a great act of benevolence, benefiting the masses of the people.</p>
<p>(2) Uncleanliness of Waterways</p>
<p>The Tanghe outside Tangqiao is the source of the city river. Therefore, the failure to improve the Tanghe affects the water quality of the city river and the health of the people. If flowers are often found and the odor fills the sky, it is the main cause of the prevalence of epidemics. It is hoped that the authorities will order the health police to conduct strict and thorough investigations at any time. If any are found, they should be strictly eliminated on the spot and the households should be strictly investigated and severely punished to punish them as an example and to maintain hygiene and respect for the lives of the people.</p>
<p>(3) Lack of Public Toilets</p>
<p>Often, in many places, residents do not know hygiene, their knowledge is low, and they set up unhygienic toilets at will, even open-air cesspools, which are very harmful to the health of the people. The gas in the toilets is enough to sicken healthy people, and the only media for epidemics—flies and mosquitoes—like to gather in this filth, and then bring the germs to food and drink, misleading mankind. Therefore, the sanitary authorities have repeatedly ordered strict elimination. However, in fact, simply implementing passive measures without actively spreading public toilets has many drawbacks. For example, although unhygienic toilets have been eliminated, ignorant people still turn a blind eye and instead intensify their efforts to scatter them everywhere, resulting in piles of feces and urine, such as in bridge holes and alleys.</p>
<p>(4) Failure to Remove Stinking Ponds</p>
<p>Anyone who has been to Xiaoshi knows that the Shashibang (commonly known as the Garbage Pond, the name of the pond is Garbage, and the degree of its filth can be known) here is a famous stinking pond, and it is the best factory for manufacturing epidemics. Residents have no public morals, do not pay attention to public health, and some families even simply pour garbage into the pond and wash their chamber pots. As a result, the pond water becomes more and more silted up, the water quality becomes more and more turbid, and in the hot summer, mosquitoes and flies gather, the pond water ferments and sublimes, and the stench fills the sky, which is enough to help the prevalence of epidemics. It is hoped that the sanitary authorities will take measures to remove it as soon as possible. The passive measure is to order residents not to pour garbage into the pond at will, and to sprinkle disinfectant water at any time. The active measure is that, in any case, the pond water cannot be used by the people. In the current economic downturn where it is difficult to raise funds, it is impossible to improve it. It is better to simply fill it in and then mark it for sale. The proceeds will be used for local public health construction to benefit the people.</p>
<p>(5) Resident Population</p>
<p>The entire county has about 350,000 people, and this town accounts for more than one-seventh of the county's population. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Importance of Public Health Nurses</h3>
<p>— Ji Jingshou</p>
<p>The development of medical and health construction in China in recent years has been rapid, and there is indeed a trend of rapid progress. The development of health construction undertakings can reduce disease rates and mortality rates, and can promote people's health, prolong people's lives, increase work ability, entertain the body and mind, and increase the country's international status, which is also an undeniable fact. The personnel who can be responsible for promoting and developing this medical and health construction undertaking are public health doctors, nurses, midwives, health inspectors, and other medical personnel; among them, public health nurses are the main tool and driving force for promoting this work, and they are also the only public health nurses who can go deep into the grassroots to do the most basic work. Whether in prosperous cities, remote poor villages, schools, families, institutions, and factories, there are footprints of public health nurses; especially in poor and remote areas where doctors cannot be hired, public health nurses can bury themselves in hard work and effort at a very low salary.</p>
<p>(1) Publicize and instill medical and health knowledge, the principles of diseases, methods of maintaining health, and how to prevent infectious diseases to the public.</p>
<p>(2) Enable the sick to receive appropriate treatment and care, in order to achieve recovery and restore physical and mental health.</p>
<p>(3) Actively contact and cooperate with local medical and health institutions and other social service organizations.</p>
<p>(4) Assist the people in solving various problems that are harmful to health.</p>
<p>Whether the health undertaking in a place is developed or not can be said to depend entirely on whether the public health nurse is talented, whether they work hard, whether they can teach the people, and whether they are willing to cooperate with others. Therefore, the work of public health nurses is closely related to the development of health undertakings, the health of the people, the strength of the country, and the rise and fall of the nation.</p>
<p>Since the work of public health nurses is as important as described above and their mission is extremely bright, public health nurses have indeed occupied a basic position in modern medical and health construction undertakings. Indeed, public health nurses are the fresh troops and vanguards responsible for vigorously promoting modern medical and health construction undertakings.</p>

<h3>Common Knowledge of Diseases Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(92) Gout (Part 1)</p>
<p>(Q) What is gout?</p>
<p>(A) Gout is a disease caused by the accumulation of uric acid in the body that cannot be excreted from the kidneys. Clinically, it causes an inflammatory state in various joints.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the English name for gout?</p>
<p>(A) It is called Gout in English, Gicht in German, and Arthritis Urica in Latin.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the causes of gout?</p>
<p>(A) The causes of gout are related to constitution and heredity. People with a family history of uric acid are often more likely to suffer from gout. In terms of one's own body, people who eat too much meat and drink excessively are also prone to this disease. Therefore, wealthy people are more likely to get it than poor people.</p>
<p>(Q) Is gout related to age and gender?</p>
<p>(A) Men are more likely to get it than women; the age of onset is from 30 to 50 years old.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of gout?</p>
<p>(A) Gout is a disease that occurs in attacks, and there is a distinction between acute attack symptoms and chronic symptoms.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of an acute attack?</p>

<p>(Q) What symptoms appear at the time of the attack?</p>
<p>(A) It mostly starts at night or in the morning and evening. First, a very severe pain occurs in the toe joint of one big toe, which is called podagra. This pain is very intense and cannot tolerate slight pressure. The affected joint is red, swollen, and hot. This gout attack lasts from night to morning and gradually subsides. However, the joint swelling does not completely disappear and recurs again the next night. This lasts for half a week.</p>
<p>(Q) Is gout over after it occurs once?</p>
<p>(A) No, it generally recurs once or several times after a few weeks or days.</p>
<p>(Q) Does gout attack other parts besides the toes?</p>
<p>(A) Later, it gradually invades the joints other than the big toe, such as the tarsal joint, ankle joint, and knee joint. It also invades the upper limb joints, hand joints, and little finger joints. All distal joints of the limb bones are easily invaded.</p>
<p>(Q) Besides the small joints, can gout invade the large joints?</p>
<p>(A) Large joints can also be invaded, and there is a possibility of attacks in the hip joint and shoulder joint.</p>
<p>(Q) After repeated attacks of gout, what abnormalities will occur in the joints?</p>
<p>(A) There are cases of joint deformity, and it can also become chronic gout. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Domestic Medicinal Plants (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>6. Peppermint Mentha arvensis, L.var.piperascens, Holmes.</p>
<p>(Plant) Grows naturally in fields and damp places by the roadside, can be cultivated, is a perennial herb. The entire plant is densely covered with short hairs. Leaves are opposite, with short petioles, oblong, with serrated edges and pointed tips. Short-stalked verticillaster inflorescences grow from the leaf axils, blooming with small, pale purple labiate flowers in summer and autumn. The achenes are small and ovoid.</p>
<p>(Cultivation) In late November, the land is prepared, and the underground stems are planted in dry fields with rows 2.5 feet wide. For paddy fields, each row should be 8 feet wide, slightly raised, and planted in two lines. Fertilizers such as soybean meal, human manure and urine, and artificial fertilizers are used. Harvesting takes place three times in China: late June, mid-August, and mid-October. Each acre yields about 250 catties of dried herbs. Peppermint oil can be extracted from the dried herbs by steam distillation. The yield is 0.8-1.8% of the dried herbs. The oil content is highest in the second harvest and lowest in the first.</p>
<p>(Crude Drug) Peppermint Leaf Folium Menthae is collected and dried. The product is oval or lanceolate, about 3-7 cm long, with irregular serrations, and a pointed tip. The leaf surface is sparsely covered with villous hairs. It has a unique aromatic odor and a cooling property.</p>
<p>(Components) The entire herb contains about 1% essential oil. The total Menthol CilH2oO content in the essential oil is 70-90% (free Menthol 65-85% Ester 3-8%), and the rest are Menthon CioHi8O Menthenon-3 CilHi60 I-Limonen 3.4 Hexenolphenylacetat C2H5-CH=CHCH2-CH2-O-CO-CH2-C6H5 Aethyln-amylkston C2H5COC5H11 etc.</p>
<p>(Medicinal Uses) The entire herb is steam distilled to produce peppermint oil, which can then be used to produce Mentholum (Bureau of Formulas). Menthol can be used to correct taste and odor. Menthol and peppermint oil are also consumed in large quantities in the manufacture of toothpaste and confectionery.</p>
<p>Japanese peppermint oil is favored for its high Monthol content, but it has a slight bitter taste and is not as fragrant as that produced in Europe and America. Therefore, Japanese peppermint oil is mainly used as a raw material for Menthol production, while European and American peppermint oil is used in confectionery. Mitcham oil produced in Mitcham, England, is considered the best, with excellent aroma and is highly valued.</p>
<h3>Hospitalization and Convalescence Costs Three Cents Per Day</h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>The Success of the Golden State's Medical Control – How is the Health of the Nation's People Guaranteed?</p>
<p>For only three cents a day, you can get three weeks or more of free hospitalization and convalescence. Are you willing to pay this small amount to avoid a huge expense that is outside of your annual household budget? Currently, 500,000 people in the United States have joined health insurance. This health insurance business is becoming increasingly popular, with tens of thousands of new members joining each month.</p>
<p>For example, Mr. So-and-so, the 100,000th member of the Associated Hospital Service of N.Y., is a completely healthy person. However, if this person suddenly becomes ill and needs hospitalization (approximately one in ten people require hospitalization), with the small membership fee paid on a regular basis, he can choose to stay in a semi-private room in one of the 137 city hospitals for 21 days free of charge. If continued hospitalization is required, he will still enjoy a 25% discount.</p>
<p>New York City's insurance fee serves as a model for the 24 large-scale "hospital insurance companies" (or health insurance companies). The minimum premium in Cleveland and Birmingham is 60 cents per month, 65 cents in Rochester, and 75 cents in Sacramento and New Orleans.</p>
<p>Hospitals charge the following fees for patients sent by such insurance companies:</p>
<p>Fee for one day's stay: $15</p>
<p>Fee for two days' stay: $20</p>
<p>Fee for three days' stay: $23</p>
<p>From the fourth day onwards, the daily fee is $6.50.</p>
<p>Hospitals welcome these patients, as it reduces the number of free patients. Although doctors do not receive any special benefits from this type of hospital income, they still welcome these insured patients, because patients do not have to bear hospital expenses and can more easily afford doctors' fees.</p>
<p>Dr. Kimball of Baylor University in Texas City was the first founder of health insurance. In 1919, he insured 1,250 school teachers for a premium of 50 cents per person per month. Due to its success, the health insurance business attracted the attention of the general public.</p>
<p>Six years later, in 1935, Miss Fenling Huxite in New York City joined forces with several apartment staff to start this business. Within a year, the total number of members reached 84,000. Today, it has exceeded 107,000, with 5,000 new members joining each month. The most amazing thing is that this matter has never been promoted through advertising, and yet the insurance business has spread without wings.</p>
<p>Dr. Kimball's original facilities are no longer sufficient for the current 18,000 members. Therefore, he is currently planning to build two new hospitals in Texas City, and several other locations are also in preparation. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Talks</p>
<h3>How Was the Fengtai Incident Resolved?</h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>The newspaper reported on the 19th that a sudden conflict had occurred between the Chinese and Japanese armies in Fengtai. Feng Zhian's troops were surrounded, a certain company commander was captured, and gunshots erupted. The two sides were in a stalemate. When I saw this news, I was quite shocked, thinking that such a serious matter would be even more serious than the Chengdu and Beihai incidents, or even expand, creating a third new record following the "September 18th" and "January 28th" incidents. This was not out of the question.</p>
<p>Therefore, I was eagerly looking forward to the newspapers on the 20th, wondering how the situation would develop after one night. To my surprise, when I opened the newspapers on the morning of the 20th, they boldly declared that the Fengtai incident had been resolved smoothly, misunderstandings had been cleared, and the company commander had been released. Such a serious problem had been resolved and reconciled in less than 24 hours. Wasn't this an unexpected piece of good news in our eyes?</p>
<p>Naturally, we never hope that the situation of such unfortunate incidents will escalate or be prolonged. If misunderstandings are cleared and the company commander is released, even if we cannot say that we have won a diplomatic victory, we have at least regained some face. However, I do not know the reason for the rapid resolution of this unfortunate incident. Was it due to the intervention of the Hebei authorities? Or was it because the Japanese side made an extraordinary retreat, seeking to appease the situation and muddle through? It is really difficult to understand how such a bad debt was settled in the end.</p>
<p>According to a Tianjin dispatch from a certain newspaper, since the Japanese North China Garrison Army was strengthened, disputes have repeatedly arisen in the Fengtai area. The soldiers stationed there often feel oppressed. Unexpectedly, at 5:00 p.m. on the 18th, a unit of the Japanese army was conducting exercises in Fengtai and intended to pass through our garrison camp. Our army tried to stop them, but the Japanese army refused to listen, and a conflict broke out. Whether the cause of this incident was as reported by a certain newspaper is still unknown, but it is unlikely to be completely false. Fengtai is an important territory of our country in North China. In our own territory, our own troops are stationed, yet such serious consequences have occurred. What kind of world is this? If we look at it this way, I cannot help but doubt how the Fengtai incident was resolved, and especially how it was resolved smoothly. Assuming that this matter can be resolved peacefully based on the two principles of not losing sovereignty and not losing territory, it would be a great blessing. However, if everything is disregarded, and we completely submit and completely comply with the will of the other party to achieve a peaceful resolution, such a resolution is worse than no resolution at all. I very much hope for peace and love peace, but peace has its limits and its way of speaking. Therefore, Confucius said, "To know harmony and to harmonize, but not to regulate it by propriety, is also not permissible." I would change his saying to, "To know harmony and to harmonize, but to forget the interests of the nation, is absolutely not permissible."</p>
<p>As I was finishing this article, I saw yesterday's newspaper, which said that all of our troops stationed in Fengtai had been withdrawn and moved to Zhao Jia Zhuang south of Fengtai. If this is the case, then in the area where Chinese and Japanese troops clashed, our army retreats one place; if there are clashes in ten places, then our army retreats ten places. I don't know how many Fengtai's our country can withdraw from? How many Zhao Jia Zhuang's can we station in? This is also considered a peaceful resolution, truly, I am speechless.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Mu Du Preservation of Chastity Bureau (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) In ancient times, chaste women were praised by sages and commended by emperors. Therefore, we can still see many chastity archways and shrines of female martyrs existing in various places; moreover, those chastity archways and shrines are all inlaid with an imperial decree or a constitutional decree. At that time, this glory and greatness can be imagined. But under the residual poison of this glory and greatness, up to now, I don't know how many innocent women have been crushed to death, and I don't know how many women have lightly ruined their lifelong happiness!</p>
<p>Chastity is regarded as private property by most men, and only women have the obligation to maintain chastity. In our country, in the past and even now, not only do men have the right to force women to maintain chastity, but also women themselves are willing to live this desolate life of a widow before death.</p>
<p>Institutions that encourage chastity, such as the Qingjie Hall, Anjie Bureau, and Baojie Bureau, have emerged in the environment of these sages, virtuous people, and philanthropists praising chastity; in the inland of our country, where the cannibalistic old etiquette forces are still very strong, such abnormal phenomena are still very common. Moreover, those gentlemen and masters, even if they marry four or five concubines themselves, righteously do not allow their wives and daughters to ruin their reputation (?). Therefore, they feel that the praise of chastity cannot be abolished under any circumstances.</p>
<p>I have visited the Anjie Bureau in Suzhou before, but it has now been merged into the Women and Children Relief Institute; today, the only remaining one is the Baojie Bureau in Mu Du.</p>
<p>Baojie Bureau, as the name suggests, we can know that it is an institution to protect chastity. Yesterday, for the convenience of going to Suzhou, I made a special trip to visit the bureau.</p>
<p>The bureau was founded in the years of the former Qing Guangxu (between 1886-1890), and to this day, it has been around for forty years. The founder was Feng Peizhi, a native of the county. — It is said that Feng Peizhi was the treasurer of the Jiangsu Daotai Yamen, and his wife's younger brother was the one who worked in the treasury. Once, his wife's younger brother embezzled tens of thousands of taels of treasury silver. After Feng discovered this, he was afraid of implicating the national law, so he diverted the money to create this Baojie Bureau; thus, the shortage was used to report to his superiors. Therefore, the Baojie Bureau is still a thing of property defense.</p>
<p>I entered the walled gate, and saw a plaque with the words "Baojie Bureau" hanging in the middle. After passing through a large courtyard, there was a very large hall. There were two osmanthus trees on both sides of the courtyard, and the fragrance of osmanthus flowers kept drilling into my nostrils; in the center of the hall was a statue of Guan Gong, next to which was a wooden couplet written by Feng himself. I only remember the second line, "Embezzling public funds, men steal and women prostitute." This may be to express himself, or perhaps to warn others.</p>
<p>After passing through another courtyard, there was another small hall. The office and reception room were also here. On the wall hung a sign with the names of chaste women and the number of people in their families, using sentences praising chastity, such as "Cao Bozhou," to number each chaste woman.</p>
<p>I had broken into three or four courtyards in a row, and had not encountered a single person. This made me a little suspicious, wondering if I had run into a cold temple or ancestral hall. But I finally plucked up my courage, like an explorer, and continued to break into the inside, turning corners and asking at the half-closed doors, only hoping to meet someone to talk to.</p>
<p>It was not until I pushed open the last door that I heard voices inside. I followed the voices and saw several old women working there.</p>
<p>Here, there are sixty to seventy square flat houses, each with a narrow, low veranda in front. Each house is inhabited by a chaste woman and her children. In addition to a bed, there are also many utensils piled up in the house, and each veranda has a clay stove, where the chaste women cook their own dishes and food. Further in is a Buddhist hall, but this Buddhist hall is just like the situation outside, appearing very messy and dilapidated. At this time, there were seven or eight chaste women embroidering in the Buddhist hall. They were very surprised to see me, an uninvited guest, but none of them came to inquire. After looking at me, they still buried their heads in their needlework.</p>
<h3>Road</h3>
<p>— Li Yinfei</p>
<p>My friend and I came out of the hotel after 2:00 a.m. It was early autumn, and the wind felt very refreshing. The road was quiet, and streetcars jingled past. A policeman was leaning against a telephone pole, listless. Rickshaw pullers were running quietly, as if afraid of waking people up. Wanting to enjoy the night scenery of the autumn streets, a rickshaw puller came up, but I shook my head to indicate that I didn't want to go home yet, even though my feet were walking in that direction.</p>
<p>A rickshaw brushed past me. I didn't pay attention, because experience told me that it was probably a dancing girl going home with sore legs. But suddenly a clear voice floated into my ears: "Hello!"</p>
<p>"Hello," like an echo in an empty valley, I replied habitually. But when I looked up, I only saw a back view, and in the dim light, I couldn't recognize whose back it was.</p>
<p>My mind was racing, almost without thinking, I waved to a rickshaw in the distance and called it over.</p>
<p>The rickshaw puller smiled cunningly at me. I ignored him and just pointed forward with my hand: "Catch up! Hurry!"</p>
<p>Gradually, we were getting closer, but I still couldn't remember whose back it was. But looking at their so-called "airplane hairstyle" and the fact that there were two people in the rickshaw, and it was the time when the dance halls were closing, I could only awkwardly shout again: "Hello!"</p>
<p>With the shout, one person turned around, while the other lowered their head even further. The person who turned around had a strange face.</p>
<p>I ordered the rickshaw to go faster and pass them. I looked back and saw that the person who had lowered their head had thick, dark eyelashes and large eyes. — A familiar face that I couldn't remember where I had seen before.</p>
<p>But finally I remembered: "Oh, it's you, Suyue!"</p>
<p>"Going home? Why are you walking back alone so late?"</p>
<p>"How about we go eat something together? I have a lot to talk to you about."</p>
<p>"It's too late," she paused, "Alright."</p>
<p>So we went to a Cantonese restaurant.</p>
<p>As soon as we sat down, the dancing girl surnamed Zhou stood up alertly again: "Mary, my head hurts a lot, I'm going back first."</p>
<p>I knew what she meant, so I smiled at her and said, "Miss Zhou, please don't misunderstand, we are just classmates from the past."</p>
<p>"Aren't we now?" The woman surnamed Zhou smiled. I knew there was a deep meaning in that smile.</p>
<p>"Of course not. Now I'm a dancing girl, and he's a young master. We are walking on extreme paths!"</p>
<p>"Suyue, don't deliberately distort the meaning in the words, okay?"</p>
<p>"I'm called Mary now!"</p>
<p>"Isn't Mary still Suyue?"</p>
<p>She seemed not to have heard my words and suddenly asked: "How is life lately? Are you married?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm married. How about you?"</p>
<p>"I've also been married and have a child, but I'm divorced, but the child is still alive and by my side." She said it very stubbornly.</p>
<p>"Which dance hall are you working at now?"</p>
<p>"I don't want you to come and watch me dance. Besides, I'm going to Hong Kong in a few days. Business in Shanghai is very bad, and there are too many acquaintances."</p>
<p>"Don't you want to see me? For the sake of our past friendship, I think I can help you a little."</p>
<p>"Thank you, I'm fine now."</p>
<p>Next, we talked about the past. I wanted to use the past to make her believe that I really wanted to help her, but none of it worked. She seemed not to understand and only said some irrelevant things.</p>
<p>The next day, I ran all over the dance halls in Shanghai, but I couldn't find her. I only met the woman surnamed Zhou, and the woman surnamed Feng also refused to leave her residence. A few days later, I went there again, and Miss Zhou gave me a note and said: "Mary left for Hong Kong yesterday. This note was written earlier because she told me to give it to you after she left Shanghai, so I kept it until now."</p>
<p>I tore it up without looking at it, because I knew what she was going to say.</p>
<p>Are we walking on extreme paths?</p>

<p>Opening "Beauty and the Wind"</p>
<p>The spring breeze in February brings new omens. Heavenly winds blow down the sounds of Buxu. Looking up and gazing at the sky, there is a cloud ladder that can be climbed. I see him, with a journey of ten thousand miles ahead of him. Rising straight up and riding the green clouds. All because the east wind intentionally lifts him up. Showing his glory to the fullest and standing out from the crowd. A fairy skirt is left for swallows. Several elegant melodies harmonize with orioles. I really don't know, where is the flute and jade sheng being played. This tune is not originally from heaven. It is said that the beauty is good at singing and dancing and skillfully playing the zheng. Let's see, gracefully like the shadow of a startled goose. As light as a flying swallow in the sky. Like Cai Wenji's Eighteen Songs of the Hu Jia. Like Xiang Ling playing the zither, sounding with a clanging sound. Like a song of Zhaojun's Lament on the pipa. Like a clever red pocket and light thief. I look at him, the plain silk is tailored into thin sleeves. The Lingbo gauze robe is clean and without dust. A pair of jade arms dance with the wind. Gladly learning Ku Deng's graceful posture. All because of the shameless, frivolous appearance of the rascal. Green Pearl guards against someone falling from the building. I'm just afraid that the willow branches are soft, delicate, and powerless. Therefore, a red silk thread is tied to the feet on the first floor. Sometimes, the wind is upside down, flipping the shadow. Playfully imitating Yang Guifei emerging from the bath, not the true face of Mount Lu. Where can a soulmate be found in this world? If it is that one day she falls into the world of dust. It provokes the cold eyes of many bystanders. Therefore, standing firmly and not losing your footing. Stop where you should and stay put. Don't break the paper tiger. Still guarding against sudden storms and heavy winds morning and evening. But originally, human life is like a dream. Even drifting with the wind is like floating clouds. Nothing more than the same ups and downs.</p>

Zhang Xiangong, to dispel his worries, walks into the Puji Temple. He bows to the monk, Xiao Facong. He sincerely bows in the Buddhist hall. He burns incense silently, praying for good luck to come. May the crimson-clad judge secretly mark him as the top scholar in the capital exams. At that time, the Great Hero's Palace will be magnificent. The solemn Buddhist statues are all majestic. After bowing, he wanders through the Buddhist hall. Surely, the flowers and trees lead to a secluded path through the Zen room. Suddenly, the tinkling of pendants and earrings comes from the inner courtyard. A pretty girl, lightly paints her eyebrows with the colors of spring. Tingting, like a fairy.

<h3>The Revitalized Jin Cheng</h3>
<p>The First Film to be Shown: "Women's Rights"</p>
<p>The Jin Cheng Grand Theater on Beijing Road has been under repair for a month. Now it is completely completed, and the interior and exterior of the theater have been completely renovated. The first film to be released has been selected, starring Hu Die, entitled "Women's Rights." Below is a brief description of the theater's situation:</p>
<p>The interior and exterior walls of the theater have been repainted, adorned and embellished, resplendent and magnificent, like entering a palace. The wall lamps and chandeliers have also been replaced with new-style electric torches, which are soft and elegant, and free from the mundane. The theater has nearly two thousand seats, making it the theater with the most seats for screening domestic films in Shanghai. They have now all been repainted and upholstered with soft cushions and silk covers, making them extremely comfortable.</p>
<p>The light on the screen of the theater, for all old viewers of domestic films, is universally praised. Now, the lamp box components have been replaced, making it even brighter and clearer. The sound section has also been replaced with the latest Ikang sound equipment, which not only has a loud sound but is also very accurate, with little difference from the original sound. The screen is not only made of rubber but is also of a size that other cinemas cannot match.</p>
<h3>A Scene from "Women's Rights"</h3>
<p>The film "Women's Rights" is the most important production of the Star Film Company this year and is Hu Die's first masterpiece after her marriage. It tells the story of an intellectual woman struggling in an adverse environment, which is both commendable and tearful, and extraordinary. It is directed by Zhang Shichuan and written by Hong Shen. From the opening to the closing, Hu Die appears in almost every scene, which is even more rare.</p>
<p>Following "Women's Rights," the New China Film Company's "Flowers of Revelry," adapted by Mr. Shi Dongshan from "The Government Inspector," will be shown in the theater. This is also a surprising harvest in the domestic film scene this year. In addition, there is also "Little Lingzi," directed by Peng Buga and starring Tan Ying. The success of this film exceeded our expectations. Perhaps no one who has seen the preview does not praise it.</p>
<p>In short, the owner of Jin Cheng is determined to build the theater into the most upscale and magnificent theater and to make it the most satisfactory entertainment venue for Chinese people. Therefore, not only are efforts made to achieve excellence in equipment, but also in various aspects of management, and efforts are made to innovate.</p>
<h3>News from Minxin Film Production</h3>
<p>The first production of Minxin Company, "Maternal Love," written and directed by Jin Qingyu, is a full-sound dialogue film, co-starring Lin Chuchu, Li Keng, Ge Zuozhi, Hu Yixing, Zhao Hua, Song Xiaodie, Hong Ling, Huang Yunzhen, Zhi Zhihua, Fei Boqing, Wen Rong, etc. It has now been fully completed, and the results are extraordinarily satisfactory. It will soon be premiered at the Jin Cheng Grand Theater in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The famous screenwriter Zhong Shigen, author of "Humanity," "City Night," "Life," and "Family Ethics," will soon direct his new work "The Gate of Spirit and Flesh" himself, and will be co-directed by Zhao Ce. The script has already been sent to Beijing for review and will be filmed as soon as it passes, as the second production of Minxin Company.</p>
<p>The script for Minxin's "Third Production" has long been decided and is currently being actively prepared. As soon as the script passes, it may be filmed at the same time as "The Gate of Spirit and Flesh." At that time, there will be an unprecedented grand occasion on the set of Minxin. It is expected that the two films can be completed simultaneously at the latest within the year.</p>
<p>Following the procedures for the third production, the fourth production is a new work directed by Jin Qingyu, and the fifth production is another script written by Zhong Shigen. As for the script and director candidates for the productions after this, negotiations are still in progress and have not yet been announced.</p>
<p>The "Special Issue of Maternal Love" has now been published, and the content is quite substantial. The whole book has a total of thirty-two pages, with copper plates occupying twelve pages. The text includes "Words from the Director," "Anecdotes and Interesting Stories Magazine," "Suzhou Trip," "Minxin Magazine Work Diary," etc. Each copy is sold for only five cents.</p>
