<p>粤機器總工會廣東總工會等團體最近上書蔣委員。長請查辦下列各案。（一）廣州市金庫失竊案。（二）市立銀行盜竊未簽發紙幣七萬元案。（三）四百餘萬元庫券舞弊案。（四）專賣鎢鑛扣取佣金案。（五）運某國士敏土專賣營利案。（六）糖廠專運走私案。（七）製造偽幣出賣案。這七項陳濟棠在任期內所發生的貪汚案件。性質都極嚴重。弊害都極深烈。然而三千萬的廣東人却一直忍耐到陳濟棠已經下了台。受着外人勢力的保護的時候。方才得到機會。把這些駭人的貪汚案伴完全舉發出來。我們從這一點。就可以明白政治機構上貪汚的毒素。决不是容易淸除的。</p>
<p>陳濟棠費了多年的苦心。訓練成十餘萬的勁旅。滿以為自己可以把廣東的地盤把持下去。殊不料中央的一紙命令就使他的勢力完全解體了。他的沒落所以如此容易的根本原因。就在他和他的親信平時那樣橫暴的貧污行為。這誰都知道。</p>
<p>然而這一種沒落的事實却還不够敎訓一般抱着貪汚心理的軍人和官吏。因為生活在現在社會制度之下的人們。誰都有着愛錢這一種本能。而貪汚心理是在濫用權力的時候。從這種普遍的本能養成的。凡是貪汚的軍人和官吏都抱着兩個目的。第一目的是在把持或者提高權位。第二目的就是做富翁。陳濟棠這次的沒落。固然使他失去了第一目的。然而他的第二目的却還是貫澈了的。他在職時候括盡了廣東的財富。失敗以後。他和他的幾個親信還把省庫僅存的若干現銀帶走。現在財部雖已令飭廣東當局從嚴追究了。但是他們托庇在外人勢力之下。要從他們手里追回那些帶走的公欽來。有多少的可能性呢。陳濟棠陳維周輩終究已經做到中國最大的富翁了。</p>
<p>况且照這樣的方式下台的也不僅陳濟棠他們。過去沒落的大軍閥和大官僚那一個不是如此下台的呢。有人說過。中國如今沒有眞正的資本家。有的只是些下台的軍閥和官僚。我們只消一查許多大銀行大公司的股東名單。就可知道這話不無相當的理由。今日中國所以窮困危急到這麼地步。委實可以完全歸因於過去軍閥官僚的貪汚。因為外患也是跟內政方面的貪汚有運繫性的。</p>
<p>受過革命洗禮的中來政府顯然早已明白這個道理了。監察制度的確立。和廉潔政治的提倡。都為的是防止軍人和官吏的貪汚。然而要根本消滅他們的貪污心理却還有更重要的前提在。我們知道。在民權最不發達的地方。貪汚的根苗最容易滋長。因為前面已經說過。貪汚的心理是從軍人和官吏的濫用權力上發生的。只有發揮了民衆的力量。使軍入和官吏各守其本分。才是根除貪汚的最有效的辦法。</p>
<p>余漢謀在回師以後所發表的幾决談話。的確極能迎合一般痛恨着貪汚政治的民衆的心理。他說此後專心訓練軍旅。絕不干預政治。而且决意縮編軍隊。使廣束軍費每月從六百萬核减到三百萬。這表示着他要恪守軍人的本職。余氏在日前省府紀念週報告的時候又主張實行下列三點。（一）開放言論（二）尊重法治（三）恢復固有民族精神。這表示着他要發揮民衆的力量。只有切實做到余氏所發表的那些主張。才能澈底澄淸貪汚的陰霾。我們進一步希望着不僅廣東一省如此做去。其他各省也如此做去。</p>

<p>— 家禾</p>
<p>目前軍部和廣田，無論從那一方面說來，都趨向肉搏的境地。現實要求平衡勢力的淸算，若使廣田再取兩可的態度，必受軍部的排斥；順從軍部走，財閥又在後面鞭韃他，與軍部露骨的對立，則軍部可把所求不成，訴諸日本國民，他指出廣田內閣的「庶政一新」，名不符實，他可以動人地非難廣田，說他忘却人民的困苦，不能接受軍部的提案，而减低各種人民的負擔；他尚可以攻擊廣田，不設立衛生省，忽視微兵檢查可怕的數字—大正十一至十五年，微兵不合格者每千人中佔二五〇名，昭和二至七年，增至三五〇名，前年又增至四百名。最後，他還可以再造一個驚動世界的事業。</p>
<p>目前已有許多事實，為我們暗示；軍部或又將抬頭，最重要的，那就是國內階級的分化，愈趨明顯。過去，閣員前田曾公開地號召旣成的政黨聯合起來，與社會火衆黨對峙。現在，由於左翼的强化，或許前日的希望，可促日本統治階級的實行。因為全評，東交等八個團體，已成立勞農無產協議會，以東交反社會大衆黨派為後盾，推舉加藤堪十為常任委員長，鈴木茂三郞為書記長，作為合法左翼大團結的先聲。力量雖然薄弱，已不若前此的一盤散沙。而且，大阪的勞動者，在「聯合戰綫」的口號下，也有打破歷來成見，團結起來的可能。到七月四日，加藤又解散勞農無產協議會，着手成立新的，左傾的，反法西斯的無產黨，那麽勢力更加雄厚了。</p>
<p>另一方面，右翼以日本生產黨的吉田益三為中心，早已號召愛國政治同盟，兵庫縣愛國社，新日本國民同盟等，在大阪開全愛國政黨合同促進懇談會。六月二十日，另開大會，到代表二百餘，欲結成「維新政黨」。恰與加藤們的舉動，遙遙相對。這表示廣田的政策，非特不能够走上中庸之道，而且益促成左右兩翼的分化。分化愈明，中間型，過渡型內閣存在的基礎愈薄弱，廣田內閣的壽命，也愈短促。當左翼由口頭宣傳演進到行動時，軍部便是日本統治階級不可缺少的工具，那時候廣田內閣，非讓位於更急進的人們，便須再經一度自我的否定。</p>
<p>目前也許已在這樣漸變的過程，不過究竟何時發生突變，那要决定於日本內部各階級勢力的消長，國際的情况，和中華民族抗爭的力量。　（完）</p>

<h3 id="c98">高夢旦先生在寶隆醫院治療經過敬告親友 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>先父自得病以來，承諸親友關切，常臨存問。并知病已日有起色，且不久即可出院。及聞噩耗，多甚駭怪。紛詢治療經過，茲謹臚述如下，幸垂鋻焉。</p>
<p>先父自四川返滬，途中得病，經醫生診斷為肺炎。即於六月卄九日入寶隆醫院出Mertens及李明琛兩醫師主治。肺炎已日就痊愈，熱度脈搏均如常人，胃口亦佳，惟夜間常州患失眠。七月八日晚間遵醫囑服安眠東兩粒，自半夜達曉呈起臥不安之狀。九日晚間即服兩粒仍不能睡。於是李明琛醫生又令服兩粒，服後不但不能入睡，反而起臥顛撲，不安之狀較前晚更甚。眼閉口張，不發一言。睡下不及一分鐘即起坐，并欲下床。用力至猛，雖侍疾者竭兩人之力，不能制止。此種現象直到次早七八時方已，後Mertens及李明琛兩醫同來病室時即以夜間之狀告之。Mertens聞服安眠藥至四粒之多，即大呼“too　much　too　much”不已。事後私問Mertens服藥過多之害國據云年紀過大心臟又弱，斷斷不宜多服安眠藥。雖經此兩次打擊，後因害割養得法，病體日有起色。胃口亦日漸強健。已能舍流質而食細米，麥片，雜蛋，切麥等。李明琛醫生曾一再相告不久即可出院。家人方自慶幸，以為從此能轉危為字，孰知變生不測，傷哉。十九日晚間，先父久久不寐，到二十日清晨一時起即覺煩燥，且說話不停。三時許請李明琛醫生來視後，即令服安眠藥Evipan兩片。君珊因已往之經騐，曾懇李醫生勿用該藥，并問可否祇服一片。李醫生力言該藥力量遠不及前次所用藥之大，服之毫不成問題云云。言畢即親將藥餅捻碎用開水送下。藥服後立刻入睡，并發鼾聲。但不及十餘分鐘又如前次之輾轉牀褥，時起時臥，十分不安。眼閉口張，一如前次之狀。但用力較前次為猛，雖竭三人之力，不能制止。五時許李醫生來即為注射安眠針Scopulamin仍無效。後又注射一安眠藥針Luminal即昏昏入睡。當時竟無人知其仍為安眠藥也。睡不及兩小時即開始顛撲不安。時起時臥無一分種之寗息。後Mertens醫生囑注身Chloralhyorut仍無效。此一日中沉迷顛撲之狀毫不稍减。但李醫生每次來按脈後，均言脈息甚佳，不久即可清醒，并云祇須多養兩日即可出院。是日下午五時許該院西入護士曾掀視膛人，即驚呼為用安眠藥過多中毒。因立刻電招Mertens醫生來視，而彼以忙稱終不至。是晚孫達方醫生（真茹法醫研究所所長）及鄭葆湜醫生來視疾。見狀均驚為中毒。急請李醫生設法救治，而李醫生因忙於應酬，良久始至。至時仍不承認為服用多量安眠藥所致。家人計無從出，即於卄一日自寶隆醫院迎回醫治。即日請海上名醫黃鐘，曾耀仲，陸錦文，周振禹，宋梧生，梁俊青，鄭葆湜，蔡鴻，及德醫Loewenberg等會診。諸醫異口同聲均斷仍用安眠藥過多而中毒。且因中毒過深，醫治甚難。自二十日晨三時起到廿三日晨零時五分止，計六十六小時，病人無一刻之安定。其痛苦之狀，見者痛心。但病人神志昏迷，自始至終未曾發一言。至力盡氣盡，即棄君珊等而長逝矣，傷哉。</p>
<p>按先父兩年前曾患心臟病。後病雖愈而心臟仍弱。入寶隆醫院後每三小時打一次強心臟藥針，多日始停。繼以服強心臟藥水。是心臟之弱為院醫所深知，何以後來竟疊次用多量安眠藥劑，據諸醫言，普通人服Evipan最大份量為兩片。今年老而心臟弱者亦服此量，此外又加注射安眠藥針，安得不因之而致命。出院時，李醫生曾有書面報告當時所用各藥。竟刪去第二次所用藥針Luminal一種。但侍疾之人，及二十日來院存問諸醫生，均已見該藥名寫在掛於門上之熱度表上。事實具在。可見致死之因實為第三次用多量安眠藥之故。君珊等侍在側，親見李明琛醫生用多量安眠藥劑而不知竭力阻止，致成此終天之恨。事後思之，搶地呼天追悔莫及矣。茲　述在寶隆醫院治療經過伏希矜鑒。</p>

<p>— 中央社特派員馮有眞寄</p>
<p>哥侖坡的華僑、據說有三百餘人、但是沒有什麽組織、最出名的大的要算林百全了、我們汽車走過他的門口的時候、看見牆上掛着一塊寫了他的名字的木牌、汽車夫告訴我們說、他在當地是很有的、他有十四個女兒、和一個兒子、但是據另外一個汽車夫說、他有十四個女兒、十個兒子、他是經營紅花油（一種同萬金油相似的藥品）的商人、自己在當地製造好了、行銷印度新加坡香港日本一帶、多少積了一點資產、他僑居哥倫坡已三十多年、現在已五十多歲了、為人很和善好客、馬的翰·余衡之·陳　德·許民德·劉權達等到他那裏拜訪、他知道船上的膳食不合中國人的胃口、特別預備一席菜蔬、請他們飽餐了一頓、據他告訴這幾位去拜訪他的客人說、僑居哥倫坡的三百多僑胞、祗有十幾個廣東人、（他目己也是廣東人）其餘大多數是山東人、以前都是來販賣府綢的、近年來巳流落異土、逼得沒有辦法、很多改行推銷日貨了、我們汽車在街上走過的時候、也看見幾個背上背了包裹的山東商人、衣服齷齪不堪、形態十分狼狽、想見其生活困苦的一般、至於華僑的商店、我們祇看見一家店名「中華商業公司」玻璃橱裏、陳列許多繡花一類的貨物、很淸潔整齊、因為時間匆促、沒有進去參觀、</p>
<p>哥倫坡的氣候與新加坡相彷、並不怎樣炎熱、晚風吹來、允覺凉爽、我們於六時半遊畢歸輪、已是萬家燈火、八時許又啟捉在印度洋中繼續前進、</p>
<p>（二）（二）波濤益形險惡</p>
<p>在哥倫坡六小時的休息、使大家於海行疲倦之餘、得到舒散的機會、身心都感暢快、可是郵船離埠後、又在印度洋中航行、道兩天時時括着大風、水底裏潛湧着的波浪、較之洋面上的汹濤益為可怕、船身不停的上下左右的擺動、暈船的人更加多了、</p>
<p>大家所最感痛苦的是飲食不慣、一面也是由暈船、一面實在是大菜不合中國人的口胃、這十幾天每餐都是以冷水解渴、以麵包魚肉充飢、每一個人都大倒胃口、視餐室為畏途、</p>
<p>住在統艙裏的幾十位同胞、每餐是吃中國飯的、船上用了一個寗波廚子替他們煮飯做菜、這消息給選手們知道了、如獲至實、都爭着請他做中國飯吃、於是道位寗波廚子就大做其生意、一碗蛋炒飯售洋五角、一葷一素一湯的飯菜、售洋一元、雖然貴了一點、但是很多的人為了救濟肚子的飢荒、仍有山陰道上、應接不暇之勢、這位廚子恐怕連做夢都沒有想到這次能勝這筆外欵、</p>
<p>離開上海已是兩星期了、大家的頭髮已漸漸的長了起來、有人到理髮窒試過、剪髮二先令半（的合國幣二元一角）、修面另加二先令、大的理髮帥對選手們再也沒有希望的了、</p>
<p>由哥倫坡到孟買共八百九十三海里、船行的須五十餘小時、預計明天早上六時可以到達出征南洋印度一帶的足球隊、將在孟買集合赴德、郵船將有五小時的停留、大家又可上岸去舒散一下、可是過孟買到馬世佛將有五天的路程、而且不是像現在離着海岸不遠的洋面航行、也許那時的波濤將更形險惡吧、大家都這樣的提心吊膽着、（七月九日寄自孟買）</p>

<p>自哥倫坡出發後、風波復作、團員在此數日中、暈船廢食者頗移、的計之達三分之一以上、故各種活動亦無形停頓、惟象棋比賽、仍然進行、决賽時吳德懋與錢一勤、經五塲惡戰、勝負未分、第一戰綫勝、第二戰和局、第三戰吳勝、第四戰和局、第五戰又和、故經遊藝委員會議决、錦標平分、亦行旅中之趣事也、</p>

<p>昨日棉布市象、因連日紗花潮趨下游、南帮生意不濃、本心難以振作、且月底墊銀之期巳屆、執貨者心思略見疲軟、幸現貨缺乏、故市勢乃得堅定、各貨售盤大致如奮、客帮定貨、交解無多、亦因坏布缺乏之故、天津帮進怡和廠輕磅粗布組斜五六十件、山東帮進各廠新花縐呢等貨一百餘箱、南昌帮進各廠縐紋呢嗶嘰五十餘件、湖南帮辦印花直貢嗶嘰花布及細斜細布下檔貨六七十件、汕頭帮廣州帮因時局和緩、粵幣暴漲、各貨漸見添辦、廣州帮續辦大批細斜、汕頭帮進條素府綢細布細斜及花布等貨五十餘件、門市及江浙內地帮因時令關係、走銷最為冷淡、秋令貨本色斜紋絨近續有開出、大生廠電車牌開售九磅價七元二角、十三磅八元九角、十六磅十元零三角、按去年售盤、九磅五元九角、十三磅七元七角、十六磅九元一角、計增加每疋一元二三角、申新十四磅紅汽車牌售盤八元五角、按去年售八元、計增五角、慶豐廠雙魚吉慶牌售盤九磅七元五角、十三磅九元四角、十六磅十元零八角、按去年開價九磅五元六角、十三磅七元六角、十六磅九元一角、計增價每疋一元七角至九角之巨、該廠雙魚吉慶牌歷年銷路最稱旺盛、去年度因開價較昂、銷數已减退逾半、照本年售盤、恐將益形滯銷、</p>

<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、均見同勝、以洋麥報價、芝加哥續好四角零、坎拿大好三五角不等、市塲人心、因洋麥已連好幾日、巳寂之氣、不免鼓動、復以日商方面、陸續有現麥出口、數雖不多、終覺有違常態、故開價後、近期卽提一分、遠期提二三分不等、以後因浮空依然暢補、空頭新籌碼、廠方未有套售、故喊價又復步緊、較之前日、近好一二分、遠期漲三四分不等、觀察後步、如現銷一寂、當不致過分俏利云、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤後、各月份一致騰貴、因洋麥報價、又漲三四五角不等、市上所傳日商購買現麥、聞已有數起、總數雖不甚巨、但獎內外之視綫、不免引起注意、不過就辦量而言、聞的計祇六七萬包、可謂無足輕重、所以因此而復振、未免小題大做也、初開時卽提三四分、後復提五六分、十一月份因補空最多、獨漲一角、餘則漲七八九分、現麥市面、廠方進胃仍未見暢、中决不動、特高貨提高四五分、開瑤灣宿州麥四元五角六分、明光等高麥四元六角、各廠共去三千多包、</p>

<p>昨客秈到頭仍旺、長江一帶來源不絕、且各路新米相繼上市、產價益見低落、但客化尚旺、四川帮去化更活、昨日又有久經沉寂之汕頭·廣州與北帮問訊、米市乃續居挺站、惟貨主與囤戶依然急求脫手、新到各貨亦多貶價售出、故市面回好之希望仍淡、川帮辦去中决米四千多包、廣帮祗去糙晚二百包、汕帮辦湘靖數百包、北帮略辦廣東機米、其他均由本街辦去、統市成交江西米八千八百五十九包、湘米一千二百包、粵米五百包、溫州米四十八包、</p>

<h3 id="c211">濁海指針　治淋之失敗與成功 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 日本帝國醫科大學陳宗堃醫師</p>
<p>世界上最有效之淋藥　只有非特異性製劑一種</p>
<p>對於淋病之治療，非專用局部之方法所能收效，蓋必有賴於全身自然療能之充盛，發生偉大之抵抗力，使淋菌在重重圍擊之中，無所遁跡，而卒被殲滅無餘，以是從前之「透膜殺菌」療法，近今已為專門醫師摒於治療之外，不欲復用此局部之消炎鎮痛劑。</p>
<p>因此，學者乃另以新的科學方法，提煉色素劑，據一般醫師實騐，本劑雖具卓效，而副作用亦甚多，如果將其粗劣部分除盡，則其藥效又連帶失却，故今日世上許多色素淋劑、，奏效不顯。</p>
<p>據Salomon　en　U．Ma　seh博士之實騐，淋病惟有施行非特殊療法，以生成全身之抗體，則可全部根治，其法即取動植物之蛋白體及胆汁，以喚起白血球之喰菌作用，而得發生免疫之，一經免疫，則淋病可無再發之虞，乃以此蛋白體併人提凈之純粹色素劑中，遂製成近世風靡各國之非特異性療法「克淋儂」內服淋劑，共治男子慢性淋之攝護腺炎，膀胱炎，睪丸炎等症，獲效殊速。的八九瓶可愈。急性淋的四五瓶左右即可全效（世間絕無一兩瓶斷根之樂）。女子淋病除服本劑外，可兼外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，則無論陰門，膣，子宮淋卽告痊瘳。兩藥毫無副作用，而「克淋儂」内服允不敗胃，患者可以大胆應用自己治療。</p>
<h3 id="c212">居民注意　氣候回熱後 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 陳少華醫師</p>
<p>患胃腸炎者激增！</p>
<p>天氣回熱後，疫病流行頗為猖獗，據本埠西藏路，上海時疫醫院統計，近數日來，病人以患胃腸炎最佔多數，夫何以夏令胃腸炎如是之多？自醫舉言，乃由於居民不愼於飲食睡眠，過度貪凉，恣意進食生冷之物，甚或誤食腐敗物混入多量之細菌，以致細菌在胃腸內繁殖，胃腸之內容物醱酵而起炎症，於是發生洩瀉腹痛，嘔吐酸水，頭重頭痛，發熱，食思缺乏等，本病據余臨床實騐，可服德國「强胃精」一藥。以淸滌胃內之腐敗物，消滅腸部之　酵，而減除其充血症狀，則在短時日內，即獲霍然根治，得免其他危險矣。（如赤痢等）</p>
<p>至於胃腸炎轉為慢性時，食慾不振，胸膈滿悶，嘈雜，嘔吐噯氣，泛酸，胃呆胃滯，心胃氣痛等，以及消化不良，大便秘結，或腸蠕動疾速之下痢水瀉，吸收障碍之大便溏薄，「强胃精」以其內食之酵醇及脾素之殊效，故對於此種疾患服之即愈，小兒吐乳綠便等本劑亦極相宜。其性格之王道純良，實非其他製劑所能企及，又善療缺乏維他命B之脚氣症，蓋其兼含豐富之維他命B也。</p>

<p>— 南通醫科大學武鍾麟醫師</p>
<p>一個不可忽視之例</p>
<p>我自從校中畢業之後，即在社會上服務，因為社會上關於花柳病特多，尤其是淋病最為流行，所以接獨此類病人為多。因此對於選擇內服之淋病藥，亦更覺因難。因為近來許多淋藥，委實難於選擇，所以不但病家被欺，我有時亦被其所惑，然日子一久—經騐就多。據我多年經騐之淋病特效藥，以「克淋儂」之功效最著，且毫無副作用。有一病人，患淋病已三四年。診察結果，知係膀胱炎，我因認定「克淋儂」一藥功效最確，所以除施手術後，即囑其服用此藥，經過五星期，即完全治，還有其夫人亦久染淋毒性白帶，亦內服「克淋儂」，外用「卡氏陰道片」治愈，此一例也。又下面一例，係趙姓病人自述。亦由余治愈者。</p>
<h3 id="c214">淋病患者　自呼寃枉！ <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>有趙永豐君，來所治病，據云前月因偶涉足花叢，致罹淋病，因見報上一種新出白濁藥，一時被廣告所惑，貿然購服，不料未幾即嘔吐交作，尿道初時本不覺十分痛楚，服此劣藥後，膿血分泌物驟然停用，小便不能，尿道管幾至破裂。故來求救云。言下不勝悔恨。當即用手術排除患者尿道中壅塞之膿血外，見共尿道粘膜已腐爛。急投以殺菌防腐之「克淋儂」後，約未三星期所有炎症腐爛腫痛，均已告痊。尿亦瑩淸，會行數次血淸檢查，無淋毒反應。證明斷根。以此知淋病息者之不可不愼重擇藥也。</p>

<p>診所：四川路寗波路轉角　診時：上午十時至下午六時。</p>
<p>遠年之攝護腺炎</p>
<p>淋毒性攝護腺炎，本是淋病中易發之續發症。故淋病患者，幾乎十九皆有攝護炎之症候。此蓋由於生理的地位關係，容易為淋菌所侵襲也。初起尚易治療，但一經失治，則將經年累月，不斷為此病所苦，而成攝護腺漏之症，於生殖力上大有妨害矣。患者每於放尿之後，有絮狀物膿汁流出，誘發射精困難，雖勉强射出之後，亦每繼之有血性之分泌物。若用尿道鏡檢查，在尿道後部，當有破裂之膿瘍，蓋攝護腺受損出血，因此尿道淤塞，致射精困難。可證明此症有悠久之時間也。</p>
<p>但此症茍其未入絕境，尚有挽救。先施以手術及電療與靜脈注射。同時投以消炎殺菌之克淋儂特效劑，則經過三數星期後，再行尿道鏡檢查，即可見其粘膜火腫退消，繼服克淋儂，必能尅日就痊。因此劑有消炎退腫，防腐利尿之功，故功效有若斯之速也。此項最進步療法，已為歐美醫所推許。惟此症因係久年之慢性病，往於房事之際，攝護腺液與精液，同時注射內，而有起子宮淋及陰道炎之危險。如不幸妻子染有此患，可外用卡而雪地陰道片為坐藥，內亦服克淋儂，則無不轉危為安，微底根冶。</p>

<p>診所寗波路四川路口　診時下午四時至六時</p>
<p>肺病藥物療法之重要性</p>
<p>近年對於肺病治療，雖尚未發明特效藥品，以消滅人體之結核菌，而能旺盛人體之組織細胞，然空氣，食餌及休息的療養，已能增進病的治愈，顧此亦不過轉導療法，並非絕對使結核病痊愈之惟一方法也，用外科手術如人工氣胸等其效力雖佳，然不必能用於每個病人。所以藥物的治療，不能不為醫家所賞用，蓋不僅能免除病人的痛苦，尤可减少療養的時間耳。不過肺藥雖多，其對於人體之組織上，不發生絲毫不良影響者，則惟有德國「補肺傘爾」一藥。以余之經騐言，本藥能制止咳嗽，改變肺癆一切嚴重疼痛的病象，與夫預防併發病，縮小病灶的範圍。故肺癆咳痰咯血症，及因結核毒素引起之潮熱盜汗，心胸苦悶，食减困瘦，肋膜炎之胸部隱痛症等等，服此藥確能根治，如能連服一個月以上，可獲癆灶全部消滅，永不復發。——不過愈後仍須注意療養，以免全功盡棄。因「補肺傘爾」善於除痰鎮咳，故傷風，小兒百日咳，哮喘，慢性氣管炎等，服此卽愈。</p>
<p>肺癆病人若遇身體過度衰弱時，可同時兼服男用「補體康」以旺盛內分泌，治愈遺精腎萎（但遺精最好服專劑「耐氏育精片」以制止之）女子可兼服「補女容」以調經補血，糾正卵巢機能，如是則兩性患者之神經衰弱失眠心悸，眩暈頭重等症，得隨結核病之漸减而告淸瘳矣。</p>

<p>— 戴德醫師</p>
<p>遺精，夢精（有夢而遺），精液漏（用力或排尿通便時滑洩者），此等精液之喪失，對於身體尤其神經系統，最為有害。蓋精液含多量蛋白質，其喪失則必阻害榮養，引起神經系統之新陳代謝不充分。因身體蛋白體之减少，故遺精患者多患衂血及衰弱症，往往不能結婚</p>
<p>本病多由手淫自凟而來。苟能服以鎮靜劑及行冷水浴，未有不能全愈者。「育精片」有治遺精夢精精液漏之偉效，迭經多數醫師試騐　明。若在患者過度衰弱早洩腰痠，頭痛健忘之塲合，可同時服以「補體康」旺盛內分泌後，補充蛋白質，則頓見事半功倍矣。中西永安有售。</p>

<p>— 金月仁醫師</p>
<p>十女九帶，此諺語也。可知白帶病在婦女界中之普遍，然因不明原因，故掃除而治愈者少。蓋此患有機械之刺戟而來者，如自凟與組暴之房事是也，有因丈夫染淋病，有因發育不全，身體虛弱等而來者。息者局部無不感到浸潤糜爛，小腹痛，月經不調，往往因此而淸發各種子宮病，及子宮附近器管病等。統計許多不孕之原因，白帶病亦居其一。</p>
<p>此病之根本醫治，無過於用德國「卡而雪地氏陰道片」，每晚取一片納入陰道為坐藥。惟如因淋病而來者，可兼服「克淋儂」，因發育不全，體虛月經不調等而來者。可兼服「補女容」，依此服用法。則不難將此頑固之白帶病掃除之也。</p>

<p>內分泌製劑之最近趨勢</p>
<p>自從德國Berthold，法國Ciaud　Bernard氏樹立內分泌學說以後，各國醫家對於內分泌學之研究皆有極大之興趣，內分必製劑，出品衆多，然良窳不一，精粗不分，故其功效，往往不能達到如預期之效果，以此許多學者對內分泌療法，皆抱懷疑態度，共實內分泌療法對於醫學上之貢獻，决非一二失敗之研究家所能否認。良由科學方法有所未盡耳。</p>
<p>蓋從前學者研究內分泌製劑之所以失敗，以其所用動物不加選擇，復無精細之科學方法為之配置，故出品粗陋，功效不能持久。內中惟德人梅倫氏之研究獨勤，故其成績亦最大。氏所發明之男用「補體康」，女用「補女容」，即內分泌製劑最後成功之證也。此二藥之成分，係先選取勇壯無病之動物，用科學方法，提出共睪丸與卵巢之新鮮荷爾蒙，剔出粗陋不純之成分，而分別製成之。凡男性下體發育不全，遺精，早漏，勃起力不堅，女乳房臀部平坦瘦弱，狀如男性，月經遲至，數量稀少，萎黃病等，以及男女兩性共有之久婚不姙，頭痛失眠，心悸亢進，健忘，腰酸脚弱。沈鬱苦悶等服此製劑後，均能使靑春腺規復正常，充分發育，上述各項症狀，皆可一掃而除。此乃內分泌製劑最近有效之證明也。</p>

<h3 id="c222">小學敎員的師資問題 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 劍平</p>
<p>最近我們看到教育當局，對於小學教育的整飭改進中，特別注意小學教員的師資間題：一方面提高小學教員的待遇，和保障小學教員的任期；另一方面更從舉辦檢定登記着手，限制師資，或者說是對師資的標準提高。同時，我們還看到那修正小學規程的公佈，這規程是根據各省市教育機關的研究結果，和各地實施小學教育的經騐而訂正的。這在修正了的規程上，我們也看到那特別加入的小學教員師資諸問題，如任用，待遇，保障，等等。這在我們覺得非常值得高興的。從來很令人注意的小學教員師資問題，現在得到這樣重視，雖然這重視的結果（辦法）並沒有滿如人意，不過也未嘗不是好的現象。</p>
<p>小學教育是最最根本的教育，他在教育的階段裏，是好比建屋的地基，是教育的第一步，無論在訓練或修養上講，這都是非常重要的階段。要養成良好的人民，或者更明白點說—要改良教育，第一步便得先把小學教育弄好不可。然而，我國的小學教育，不客氣地說：老老實實是腐敗不堪。內地限於種種困難的不要去說他，便算上海這大瓤市，小學教育的腐敗，實在用不着怎樣去引證了。當然，小學教育之所以腐敗，他的理由是多方面的，在這裏我們只特別拿師資問題來舉例。</p>
<p>一般人都有好高騖遠的心理。普通一般觀念，對教育事業常常是不屑的，很像走上了教書這一條路，實餓死無疑，這尤其以小學教員更其怕人。然而這類人我們可以說他是不懂教育。教書雖然苦，但却是相當重要的，也尤其是小學教員。小學旣是教育之始，如果教員不好，影響一壞便不可收拾。同時小學校的功課是多方面的兒童的心理，是有點特別搆造的，如果不是常識豐富，對兒童心理有特別研究的人是不堪勝任的。因此，在這裏我們覺得：一般勝任小學教員師資的人不去任教，這是一般「向上爬」的心理的錯誤。由此，因而小學教員的腐濫，便做成了現在小學教育的腐敗的原因之一了。</p>
<p>然而，我們也不能深怪他們的，主要的還是小學教員的待遇問題。不久以前我們還聽說過徐州教員枵腹自殺，至於欠薪，或者無保障等更不勝計算了。在上海尤為可怕，一個小學教員他們常常比一個工人都不如，薪俸不要說，便是伙食也不一定是人的待遇。這是對的，餓了肚皮那裏可以教書。語又願做小學教員哩。</p>
<p>現在師資是限制了。待遇，保障，等都在公文上規定了。不過，我們需要的實行，不要再是一紙具文，空頭支票騙坐冷板櫈的老百姓歡喜。</p>

<p>於此，板凳拉過來，諸色人等彷彿看特殊的熱鬧，層層地包圍着。穿袴綢衣裳的那個女人，一臉的大麻子，兩片嘴唇薄得露不出紅，眼睛却有異常的光彩，咕嚕咕嚕的在轉，日光，吞食了他白皙的皮膚，同衣裳一樣，有一層亮的光。後面的一個呢？不開口。搖着芭蕉的大扇子，風打在兩人的身上，不用說，那就是一個副手。</p>
<p>手張開了，看看縱橫交叉的手紋，開一下年紀，更端詳了一回五官，把眼珠咕嚕幾下子，依着往常的秘訣，—金手玉手，拿了就走，你的手，紋交成金，不愁穿用，好心待人，不得好報。只一頓，現在，你先生作什麽事體？</p>
<p>大姐的臉一紅，把頭低下去，旁邊的人在竊笑，不知由那位代說了一句：「還沒出嫁吶！」</p>
<p>—在相貌上，今年當有喜運，十五六歲爺娘修，二十出頭自己修，不過，在八月里—眼珠又咕嚕幾下，心里計算着那個數目，要有三忌，紅吃不得，鏡照不得，衣晒不得，這，都能與良己的運命發生直接的影響，—懂嗎？</p>
<p>懂當然是懂的，那—究竟在那一天呢？大姐相信了，間着。</p>
<p>—時辰可不知道，她的心也在笑，那時辰是須要推敲才能知道的。</p>
<p>不用說，相面不涉「推敲」，想推敲還得有相當的代價。終於，她失望了，重複全部的給打碎，張了失神的眼色，念頭的問了一句：有人要相吧？代看小兒科？</p>
<p>—那一個怎麽不看呢？忍不住的我問了一句：這營生，一天可有幾文？</p>
<p>—她是駱駝，牽了她才靈。營生麽？靠不住，完全的要憑氣數。</p>
<p>預的走了，生活的需求緊咬着她們的心，相？運命？她怎麽不把自己的運命弄得好些呢？留在弄堂的，有不同的談論喲！</p>

<p>— 徐疾</p>
<p>夜是窒息而悶熱，天空是混濁而昏暗，大氣沈重地把人壓得喘不過氣，像是懷着一種最大的仇恨與决心，定要把這些被窒息的生物壓得粉碎似的。臨睡的時候，人們焦慮着，在一天的酷熱中做了辛苦而無希望的田裏的工作以後，都疲乏得像一堆污泥了，時常把頭仰起來，望望烏黑的，高得不可捉摸的天空，像是在訴告一些無處伸訴的哀愁與不幸：天空是混濁而烏黑，雲沈重地推動着，像是要下雨，要打雷的樣子；「怕是有一陣大的雷雨來了吧—怎麽還不來呢？天那麽熱，要把人煏死了！」</p>
<p>人們都希望會有一塲可怕的雷雨，這樣，也許可以把土地潤濕一下，冲洗一下：而且，可怕的雷雨過了以後，天氣是會淸明起來的，野外有微微的風，大是碧藍的，天上閃着晶亮而明凈的，小小的星星……</p>
<p>可是，夜已經落得很深，人們都在生活的哀愁中承襲了地們底可怕的惡夢，而天空是依舊木然無言地昏暗着；屋內，在黑暗中，嗡嗡地飛翔着成羣的蚊虫；在外面，在那所不遠的池潭中，有靑蚌在混濁不淸地鳴呌……</p>
<p>翻了一個身，扯住那條破碎而骯髒的蓆子，在嗡嗡的蚊堆裏，已過了六十歲的長林老媽又嚎淘地驚哭起來了：「啊呀，啊呀！怎麽的！這世界還成什麼世界哪……」可怕的夢囈的驚呼衝破了死寂的午夜，在榻上打盹的畏林老爹也給驚醒了，縐了縐眉，又沈重地，像原諒什麽人那樣地嘆了口氣，到淸醒了的時候，便又怨恨地，怒氣衝衝地趕到裏邊去，一手拉起了那驚哭着的老婆子，沒命地搖着：「你這老東西！醒醒！醒醒！你又在發痴麽，你要尋死嗎！」</p>
<p>眼淚淋漓地，長林老媽被從一個從未有過的可怕的惡夢中驚醒過來了。一腔憤怒與哀愁在衰老的腦子裏不斷地起伏，嗚咽與抽泣使她底嘶啞的聲音成了一串斷續的原始的語音。可是，卽使多麼地費力，她也終於用盡了所有的勇氣與艱難，把一些可怕的事情述說了：「我夢見了我們底長林……鮮血淋漓地……他被××人殺掉了，像殺掉一隻豬那樣地……」</p>
<p>人走了是像石頭落進了大海裏一樣的，半個月來了呀，依舊是一點消息也沒有，誰知道人是失落在那一個世裏去了呢？</p>
<p>然而，終於想得了一個莫大的解决似地，帶着商求的口氣，長林老媽又對她底「老頭子」說了：「明天，你再向街上去打聽打聽吧……」</p>
<p>「睡你的吧！那裏去打聽呢？</p>
<p>再也沒有勇氣說下去了，老爹隨身在那隻破床上一躺，嘆了口氣，潤濕的，老花的眼光從夜的空中直看出去：一切是烏黑的。蚊虫在飛着，呌着；蛙在近處的池潭裏嗚噪，天空是烏黑的，大氣沈重而窒息，悶熱的氣流像霧一樣地蒸騰着，四周連一些兒風也沒有……</p>
<p>長林老爹突然地怔了一下，一股難受的，澈骨的刺痛從心底裏衝出來，狠狠地蹂踏了他！然而他終於忍住了，像懷着一種更大的怨恨似的，改換了多少有點粗暴的口氣，低聲地說了：「你別那麼發瘋了！那樣的事情怎麽會有呢……？你別那麼亂喊亂呌的，今天外面戒了嚴，近處也放了步哨，給聽見了可不是玩的……」</p>
<p>「什麽了不起，最多也不過是死罷咧六十開外的人了，還要受那種磨折，眼看着自己底兒子給抓去了，那麼長久，也不知死啊活的！我…還活什麽呢？死了吧，讓他們來抓了去吧！」</p>
<p>可是，雖然那麽說，一想起那些强盜一樣的大兵底槍柄與剌刀，便也不知不覺地把聲音收歛起來了。三十六歲的那麽一個結結實實的漢子！長林，在街上拉拉小車，為了不給車錢和那些「鬼子」的大兵們吵了架，晚上在小酒店裏喝醉了酒，便囉囉囌囌地發了一陣子嘮駡，駡呀駡的，給便探們抓去了……</p>

<p>我們的桅檣上正旋轉七色的明燈。蔚藍的海面上，月光下，遠處疏落的船變在蕩着，白帆像夢一樣地。</p>
<p>伴着水波的洪聲，我們歌唱了。低飛的海鴻搖着翅膀給我們拍和。我們是海上的吉卜西，去年在地中海畔過着初秋，撫着衰黃的葡萄葉，追忍着我們的祖國，現在已是夏天，我們又離國門，漸漸遠了，漸漸遠了。盼望着的眼睛是凋謝了，只有歌喉還是跟往年一樣。我們歌唱着，為着海，為着我們的憂鬱，我的不斷地歌。我們愛海，海是我們的親人，可是人世間沒有一個人知道我們心中的大海呵！</p>
<p>夢，迷失在汪洋的波濤中了。在波聲里，我聞到故鄉的橙花香，也看衣母親如絲的頭髮，白了白了。像海波上的銀光一樣。而我們的希望呢？</p>
<p>夜色濃了，繁早在低語，緣吐露着什麼秘密。永不停瞬的眼波跟我們的親人一樣永遠凝視着我們，然而我們的親人却漸漸遠了，漸漸遠了。</p>
<p>那能禁住自己的心頭不再返來記憶的黑影？多年的刦運什麼時候才解脫呢？像一個肺病女期望着她的明天，然而到了明天她的歌喉早已啞了。靑春像着虛幻的期望，像一根游絲，被天外的風吹跑了。</p>
<p>只有海不絕地憂鬱地響着，伴和着我們的歌。現在海也幽黯了，我也嗚咽了，因為我們離開故鄉如果樹園已經遠了呵。</p>

<h3 id="c227">小學敎員的師資問題 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 劍平</p>
<p>最近我們看到教育當局，對於小學教育的整飭改進中，特別注意小學教員的師資間題：一方面提高小學教員的待遇，和保障小學教員的任期；另一方面更從舉辦檢定登記着手，限制師資，或者說是對師資的標準提高。同時，我們還看到那修正小學規程的公佈，這規程是根據各省市教育機關的研究結果，和各地實施小學教育的經騐而訂正的。這在修正了的規程上，我們也看到那特別加入的小學教員師資諸問題，如任用，待遇，保障，等等。這在我們覺得非常值得高興的。從來很令人注意的小學教員師資問題，現在得到這樣重視，雖然這重視的結果（辦法）並沒有滿如人意，不過也未嘗不是好的現象。</p>
<p>小學教育是最最根本的教育，他在教育的階段裏，是好比建屋的地基，是教育的第一步，無論在訓練或修養上講，這都是非常重要的階段。要養成良好的人民，或者更明白點說—要改良教育，第一步便得先把小學教育弄好不可。然而，我國的小學教育，不客氣地說：老老實實是腐敗不堪。內地限於種種困難的不要去說他，便算上海這大瓤市，小學教育的腐敗，實在用不着怎樣去引證了。當然，小學教育之所以腐敗，他的理由是多方面的，在這裏我們只特別拿師資問題來舉例。</p>
<p>一般人都有好高騖遠的心理。普通一般觀念，對教育事業常常是不屑的，很像走上了教書這一條路，實餓死無疑，這尤其以小學教員更其怕人。然而這類人我們可以說他是不懂教育。教書雖然苦，但却是相當重要的，也尤其是小學教員。小學旣是教育之始，如果教員不好，影響一壞便不可收拾。同時小學校的功課是多方面的兒童的心理，是有點特別搆造的，如果不是常識豐富，對兒童心理有特別研究的人是不堪勝任的。因此，在這裏我們覺得：一般勝任小學教員師資的人不去任教，這是一般「向上爬」的心理的錯誤。由此，因而小學教員的腐濫，便做成了現在小學教育的腐敗的原因之一了。</p>
<p>然而，我們也不能深怪他們的，主要的還是小學教員的待遇問題。不久以前我們還聽說過徐州教員枵腹自殺，至於欠薪，或者無保障等更不勝計算了。在上海尤為可怕，一個小學教員他們常常比一個工人都不如，薪俸不要說，便是伙食也不一定是人的待遇。這是對的，餓了肚皮那裏可以教書。語又願做小學教員哩。</p>
<p>現在師資是限制了。待遇，保障，等都在公文上規定了。不過，我們需要的實行，不要再是一紙具文，空頭支票騙坐冷板櫈的老百姓歡喜。</p>

<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>於此，板凳拉過來，諸色人等彷彿看特殊的熱鬧，層層地包圍着。穿袴綢衣裳的那個女人，一臉的大麻子，兩片嘴唇薄得露不出紅，眼睛却有異常的光彩，咕嚕咕嚕的在轉，日光，吞食了他白皙的皮膚，同衣裳一樣，有一層亮的光。後面的一個呢？不開口。搖着芭蕉的大扇子，風打在兩人的身上，不用說，那就是一個副手。</p>
<p>手張開了，看看縱橫交叉的手紋，開一下年紀，更端詳了一回五官，把眼珠咕嚕幾下子，依着往常的秘訣，—金手玉手，拿了就走，你的手，紋交成金，不愁穿用，好心待人，不得好報。只一頓，現在，你先生作什麽事體？</p>
<p>大姐的臉一紅，把頭低下去，旁邊的人在竊笑，不知由那位代說了一句：「還沒出嫁吶！」</p>
<p>—在相貌上，今年當有喜運，十五六歲爺娘修，二十出頭自己修，不過，在八月里—眼珠又咕嚕幾下，心里計算着那個數目，要有三忌，紅吃不得，鏡照不得，衣晒不得，這，都能與良己的運命發生直接的影響，—懂嗎？</p>
<p>懂當然是懂的，那—究竟在那一天呢？大姐相信了，間着。</p>
<p>—時辰可不知道，她的心也在笑，那時辰是須要推敲才能知道的。</p>
<p>不用說，相面不涉「推敲」，想推敲還得有相當的代價。終於，她失望了，重複全部的給打碎，張了失神的眼色，念頭的問了一句：有人要相吧？代看小兒科？</p>
<p>—那一個怎麽不看呢？忍不住的我問了一句：這營生，一天可有幾文？</p>
<p>—她是駱駝，牽了她才靈。營生麽？靠不住，完全的要憑氣數。</p>
<p>預的走了，生活的需求緊咬着她們的心，相？運命？她怎麽不把自己的運命弄得好些呢？留在弄堂的，有不同的談論喲！</p>
<h3 id="c229">仲夏夜之夢 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 徐疾</p>
<p>夜是窒息而悶熱，天空是混濁而昏暗，大氣沈重地把人壓得喘不過氣，像是懷着一種最大的仇恨與决心，定要把這些被窒息的生物壓得粉碎似的。臨睡的時候，人們焦慮着，在一天的酷熱中做了辛苦而無希望的田裏的工作以後，都疲乏得像一堆污泥了，時常把頭仰起來，望望烏黑的，高得不可捉摸的天空，像是在訴告一些無處伸訴的哀愁與不幸：天空是混濁而烏黑，雲沈重地推動着，像是要下雨，要打雷的樣子；「怕是有一陣大的雷雨來了吧—怎麽還不來呢？天那麽熱，要把人煏死了！」</p>
<p>人們都希望會有一塲可怕的雷雨，這樣，也許可以把土地潤濕一下，冲洗一下：而且，可怕的雷雨過了以後，天氣是會淸明起來的，野外有微微的風，大是碧藍的，天上閃着晶亮而明凈的，小小的星星……</p>
<p>可是，夜已經落得很深，人們都在生活的哀愁中承襲了地們底可怕的惡夢，而天空是依舊木然無言地昏暗着；屋內，在黑暗中，嗡嗡地飛翔着成羣的蚊虫；在外面，在那所不遠的池潭中，有靑蚌在混濁不淸地鳴呌……</p>
<p>翻了一個身，扯住那條破碎而骯髒的蓆子，在嗡嗡的蚊堆裏，已過了六十歲的長林老媽又嚎淘地驚哭起來了：「啊呀，啊呀！怎麽的！這世界還成什麼世界哪……」可怕的夢囈的驚呼衝破了死寂的午夜，在榻上打盹的畏林老爹也給驚醒了，縐了縐眉，又沈重地，像原諒什麽人那樣地嘆了口氣，到淸醒了的時候，便又怨恨地，怒氣衝衝地趕到裏邊去，一手拉起了那驚哭着的老婆子，沒命地搖着：「你這老東西！醒醒！醒醒！你又在發痴麽，你要尋死嗎！」</p>
<p>眼淚淋漓地，長林老媽被從一個從未有過的可怕的惡夢中驚醒過來了。一腔憤怒與哀愁在衰老的腦子裏不斷地起伏，嗚咽與抽泣使她底嘶啞的聲音成了一串斷續的原始的語音。可是，卽使多麼地費力，她也終於用盡了所有的勇氣與艱難，把一些可怕的事情述說了：「我夢見了我們底長林……鮮血淋漓地……他被××人殺掉了，像殺掉一隻豬那樣地……」</p>
<p>人走了是像石頭落進了大海裏一樣的，半個月來了呀，依舊是一點消息也沒有，誰知道人是失落在那一個世裏去了呢？</p>
<p>然而，終於想得了一個莫大的解决似地，帶着商求的口氣，長林老媽又對她底「老頭子」說了：「明天，你再向街上去打聽打聽吧……」</p>
<p>「睡你的吧！那裏去打聽呢？</p>
<p>再也沒有勇氣說下去了，老爹隨身在那隻破床上一躺，嘆了口氣，潤濕的，老花的眼光從夜的空中直看出去：一切是烏黑的。蚊虫在飛着，呌着；蛙在近處的池潭裏嗚噪，天空是烏黑的，大氣沈重而窒息，悶熱的氣流像霧一樣地蒸騰着，四周連一些兒風也沒有……</p>
<p>長林老爹突然地怔了一下，一股難受的，澈骨的刺痛從心底裏衝出來，狠狠地蹂踏了他！然而他終於忍住了，像懷着一種更大的怨恨似的，改換了多少有點粗暴的口氣，低聲地說了：「你別那麼發瘋了！那樣的事情怎麽會有呢……？你別那麼亂喊亂呌的，今天外面戒了嚴，近處也放了步哨，給聽見了可不是玩的……」</p>
<p>「什麽了不起，最多也不過是死罷咧六十開外的人了，還要受那種磨折，眼看着自己底兒子給抓去了，那麼長久，也不知死啊活的！我…還活什麽呢？死了吧，讓他們來抓了去吧！」</p>
<p>可是，雖然那麽說，一想起那些强盜一樣的大兵底槍柄與剌刀，便也不知不覺地把聲音收歛起來了。三十六歲的那麽一個結結實實的漢子！長林，在街上拉拉小車，為了不給車錢和那些「鬼子」的大兵們吵了架，晚上在小酒店裏喝醉了酒，便囉囉囌囌地發了一陣子嘮駡，駡呀駡的，給便探們抓去了……</p>

<p>虞姬</p>
<p>歷史上我們所熟知的暴君。——秦始皇。當時焚書坑儒。使用着慘暴的專制制度，來壓迫我們老百姓。老百姓，被他壓迫得沒有路走了，於是，他們之中燃燒著反抗的怒火！但是，他們的下意識給封建的鐡磚禁錮著，使他們不能把自己　衆的力量團結起來。</p>
<p>作為個人英雄的霸王——項羽，給他看到了這一點，個人英雄位禄使他想取秦始皇的寶座而代之。於是他打起了新的打倒秦始皇的動聽的革命旗幟，欺騙一些勞苦大衆為爭取他自己的寶座去相互的被屠殺，被犧牲。</p>
<p>勞苦大衆想急切的得到自身的自由解放！他們終于在這動聽的口號下，被朦蔽，被迷惑着，勇敢地推翻了「焚書坑儒」的秦始皇。</p>
<p>秦始皇是被打倒了。</p>
<p>可是，無　革命也算是成功了。然而料寶却漸漸地更　　出新的魔王的更殘暴！更淫虐。</p>
<p>這是所展開的是項羽的士兵　衆認清了他們自己而不顧為項羽個人爭位禄爭地盤，白日的犧牲掉；自己一致的團結起來反對戰爭！——廢除戰爭！</p>
<p>為了爭奪地盤，項羽自家兒楚國却大部份的給劉邦他們佔駐了。當那子夜初交，四野包圍着劉邦他們的漢軍，不時在他們的營帳中，　拂過來一些悲壯的，楚國的歌聲，還歌聲　引起了回不了楚國的兄弟們思鄉的情緒，感到了失去什麽似的。</p>
<p>霸王項羽也為這種歌聲所侵蝕，而感到坐立不安地拿了劍瘋狂的衛出去，意欽嚇退那些發散開走來的歌聲……</p>
<p>這一次士兵兄弟們都決心不再為項羽打仗了，衛兵羅平是一個認識過清的青年，他跟全伴胡德和令外幾個兄弟被做了中心的人物，出現在幕帳的崗位前，討論着發動十萬兄弟們的反戰爭求和平運動的步驟。</p>
<p>霸王項羽的愛姬——虞姬，她雖然以妖媚取得這個魔王的喜悅，可是生理的需要却使她愛上了年青的衛兵羅平。她是貴族人家出生的小姐，她雖有一種新的偉樣整附着，可是，對於舊的她還相當留戀，形成了二重矛盾的心理。</p>
<p>她照顧全了項羽的生命安全，而作為對于項羽的報答。但是羅平却堅决的說：『不是愛就是恨，如果你和我們站在一起，那就是不愛他，就是恨他！否則！那你就是我們的仇敵！』而使她「無庸致辯」的失望了。</p>
<p>一方面，項羽這魔王，他在卽將殞落的瞬間，出去擅了一陣子回來。還得喝酒作樂。……當弟兄們齊舉起了反戰的義旗到來的時候，這就像是為自己最後的祭忌。……雖然他還想掙扎！</p>
<p>「先生……我們是來傳達我們的意見的，……我們全體弟兄們現在覺悟了！以前，你們騙了我們來打倒秦始皇！說是「革命！」可是：現在「革命」成功了，我們所希望的和平却不會看見！而你們的狐狸尾巴現出來了！屠殺百姓掠奪百姓：壓迫百姓的魔王剛被打倒，你們便替代他做了更殘酷，更淫虐的魔王：我們本來可以得到了和平！但，你却給我們驅逐到更殘暴的，走向死滅的戰爭上去！使我們的血，填砌成你的寶座，用我們的骷髏，剛刻成你們的王冠；你們爭權奪利，我們却血肉橫飛，你們錦衣美食，我們是飢寒交迫！我們快要毀滅了，而你們却還酣戰未已！先生！我們不願意再以我們有限的骸骨，填你們無底的慾壑了！現在告訴你……我們這十萬剩餘的生命！為得要創造未來的社會！我們不再為你做犧牲品了，我們不再為你打仗了！」……還自覺的怒吼！使統治者項羽之類在　衆的面前發抖！</p>
<p>『這就是我們　衆的力量！』</p>
<p>『…………………………』</p>
<p>可是；虞姬却在二重心理矛盾的掙扎中替代了年輕的羅平而無謂的犧牲在魔王項羽的劍下了。…………</p>

<p>虞姬</p>
<p>歷史上我們所熟知的暴君。——秦始皇。當時焚書坑儒。使用着慘暴的專制制度，來壓迫我們老百姓。老百姓，被他壓迫得沒有路走了，於是，他們之中燃燒著反抗的怒火！但是，他們的下意識給封建的鐡磚禁錮著，使他們不能把自己　衆的力量團結起來。</p>
<p>作為個人英雄的霸王——項羽，給他看到了這一點，個人英雄位禄使他想取秦始皇的寶座而代之。於是他打起了新的打倒秦始皇的動聽的革命旗幟，欺騙一些勞苦大衆為爭取他自己的寶座去相互的被屠殺，被犧牲。</p>
<p>勞苦大衆想急切的得到自身的自由解放！他們終于在這動聽的口號下，被朦蔽，被迷惑着，勇敢地推翻了「焚書坑儒」的秦始皇。</p>
<p>秦始皇是被打倒了。</p>
<p>可是，無　革命也算是成功了。然而料寶却漸漸地更　　出新的魔王的更殘暴！更淫虐。</p>
<p>這是所展開的是項羽的士兵　衆認清了他們自己而不顧為項羽個人爭位禄爭地盤，白日的犧牲掉；自己一致的團結起來反對戰爭！——廢除戰爭！</p>
<p>為了爭奪地盤，項羽自家兒楚國却大部份的給劉邦他們佔駐了。當那子夜初交，四野包圍着劉邦他們的漢軍，不時在他們的營帳中，　拂過來一些悲壯的，楚國的歌聲，還歌聲　引起了回不了楚國的兄弟們思鄉的情緒，感到了失去什麽似的。</p>
<p>霸王項羽也為這種歌聲所侵蝕，而感到坐立不安地拿了劍瘋狂的衛出去，意欽嚇退那些發散開走來的歌聲……</p>
<p>這一次士兵兄弟們都決心不再為項羽打仗了，衛兵羅平是一個認識過清的青年，他跟全伴胡德和令外幾個兄弟被做了中心的人物，出現在幕帳的崗位前，討論着發動十萬兄弟們的反戰爭求和平運動的步驟。</p>
<p>霸王項羽的愛姬——虞姬，她雖然以妖媚取得這個魔王的喜悅，可是生理的需要却使她愛上了年青的衛兵羅平。她是貴族人家出生的小姐，她雖有一種新的偉樣整附着，可是，對於舊的她還相當留戀，形成了二重矛盾的心理。</p>
<p>她照顧全了項羽的生命安全，而作為對于項羽的報答。但是羅平却堅决的說：『不是愛就是恨，如果你和我們站在一起，那就是不愛他，就是恨他！否則！那你就是我們的仇敵！』而使她「無庸致辯」的失望了。</p>
<p>一方面，項羽這魔王，他在卽將殞落的瞬間，出去擅了一陣子回來。還得喝酒作樂。……當弟兄們齊舉起了反戰的義旗到來的時候，這就像是為自己最後的祭忌。……雖然他還想掙扎！</p>
<p>「先生……我們是來傳達我們的意見的，……我們全體弟兄們現在覺悟了！以前，你們騙了我們來打倒秦始皇！說是「革命！」可是：現在「革命」成功了，我們所希望的和平却不會看見！而你們的狐狸尾巴現出來了！屠殺百姓掠奪百姓：壓迫百姓的魔王剛被打倒，你們便替代他做了更殘酷，更淫虐的魔王：我們本來可以得到了和平！但，你却給我們驅逐到更殘暴的，走向死滅的戰爭上去！使我們的血，填砌成你的寶座，用我們的骷髏，剛刻成你們的王冠；你們爭權奪利，我們却血肉橫飛，你們錦衣美食，我們是飢寒交迫！我們快要毀滅了，而你們却還酣戰未已！先生！我們不願意再以我們有限的骸骨，填你們無底的慾壑了！現在告訴你……我們這十萬剩餘的生命！為得要創造未來的社會！我們不再為你做犧牲品了，我們不再為你打仗了！」……還自覺的怒吼！使統治者項羽之類在　衆的面前發抖！</p>
<p>『這就是我們　衆的力量！』</p>
<p>『……』</p>
<p>可是；虞姬却在二重心理矛盾的掙扎中替代了年輕的羅平而無謂的犧牲在魔王項羽的劍下了。……</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Guangxi has completed solid defensive works on the Hunan and Guizhou sides, focusing on defense, and is mobilizing heavy troops to gather in Wuzhou, planning to invade Guangdong with all its strength. (29th Late Evening Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The situation in Guangxi is increasingly serious: (1) All troops in the province have been transferred to the border between Hunan and Guangxi, with the rear being responsible for defense by local militias. Bai Chongxi personally went to the defense area of Quanzhou on the morning of the 28th to inspect, command his troops, arrange defensive works, and convene frontline commanders for instructions. (2) Silver is being concentrated. The Guangxi Bank of Wuzhou has transferred over 4.4 million yuan of silver to Nanning. Although transportation between the province and Wuzhou is still normal, martial law has been implemented in Wuzhou. (3) Nearly a thousand foreigners have entered Guangxi, and recently over a hundred military personnel have arrived in Wuzhou. It is said that a batch of munitions is also being transported to Guangxi for support. (4) Recently, a large number of people have jointly sent a letter warning Li Bai in the name of an "Anti-Civil War Group," criticizing him for colluding with foreign powers under the pretext of resisting the enemy, leading wolves into the house to achieve his goals, and bitterly condemning the harm of civil war, urging Li Bai to resign from his post as soon as possible to avoid harming the local area. (5) Yu Hanmou has secretly ordered Chen Zhang's First Regiment of the Second Independent Brigade, He Lianfang, and Liang Rongqiu's Second Regiment to rush to Zhaoqing Ducheng and the Guangdong-Guangxi border area to monitor the movements of the Guangxi army.

<p>(Hong Kong) Lin Yun'gai cabled Jiang on the 29th, stating that he would come to Nanjing for instructions after Huang Musong takes over as Chairman of Guangdong. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Lin Yun'gai separately cabled President Jiang and Huang Musong, the new Chairman of Guangdong, on the 29th, reporting that he would go to the capital after the handover and requesting Huang to come to Guangdong to take over as soon as possible. (1) "Respectfully to President Jiang Junjian of the Executive Yuan in Guling: I have received your telegram. I have served in my post for several years and am ashamed to have accomplished nothing. I am fortunate to be relieved of my responsibilities. Please urge my brother Musong to come and take over as soon as possible. I will come to Nanjing to listen to your instructions after the handover. Respectfully, Lin Yun'gai." (2) "Respectfully to Chairman Huang Musong in Guling: I have received the telegram from President Jiang, respectfully learning that the Central Government has appointed you to preside over the government of Guangdong. The local responsibility is heavy, and it is deeply gratifying that it is entrusted to your talents. I have concluded everything here and am waiting for your arrival in Guangdong to take over. I earnestly request you to come as soon as possible. Your younger brother, Lin Yun'gai." (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) After the announcement of Huang Musong's appointment as head of Guangdong, over twenty organizations, including the Hong Kong Chongzheng General Association, sent congratulatory telegrams on the 29th, saying that "With the foresight of a revolutionary, he will be the leader of the Baiyue region.

<h3 id="e5">Chen Jitang Leaves Hong Kong <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) It is widely rumored here that Chen Jitang took the French postal ship "General Chaffee" to France at noon on the 28th. The reason is that when the French mail ship arrived in Hong Kong on the morning of the 28th, a British person went to the French postal shipping company with 10,000 Hong Kong dollars to purchase eight first-class seats, only specifying the names of Qu Fangpu and Lin Yizhong. As for the remaining six people, it was said that their names would be registered upon boarding. The British warship "Meifu," which previously carried Chen Jitang to Hong Kong, suddenly arrived in Hong Kong from the province and sailed out of the harbor to cruise. It is generally speculated that Chen Jitang, for the sake of caution, might take this ship out of the harbor to board the ship. It is also rumored that although Chen Jitang does not have a formal passport, he has negotiated with a certain party to obtain another procedure for leaving the country. However, when reporters visited Chen's residence on McDonald Road on the morning of the 29th, his servant came out and said that Chen was currently ill at home and had not gone anywhere else. When asked, Detective Chief Murphy of the police station also said that the news of Chen leaving Hong Kong was absolutely untrue. After Chen arrived in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government immediately dispatched four detectives to protect Chen's residence on McDonald Road. Chen was quite uneasy and entrusted someone to send 100,000 Hong Kong dollars to a certain tycoon to ask for help in facilitating his departure. (29th Late Evening Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Weizhou secretly took the "General Chaffee" ship from Hong Kong to Haiphong at noon on the 28th. It has been verified that Lin Yizhong and Qu Fangpu were also traveling with him. (29th Late Evening Dispatch)</p>

<p>The detailed rules for the implementation of income tax were reviewed and completed on the 29th and will be submitted to Minister Kong for approval and filed with the Executive Yuan for record. The start of collection is set for September 1st. The calculation and reporting of income will adopt the reporting method except for those subject to withholding. Separate investigation methods will be used to prevent concealment and false reporting for adjustment. The reporting and tax payment periods are planned to be divided into two periods. For companies, firms, and factories that usually use the lunar calendar, the deadline will be in March, April, and May. Those who follow the Gregorian calendar will be scheduled for July, August, and September at the turn of each year to facilitate calculations. The organizational law of the collection agency will be drafted soon. The name is roughly the Central Direct Tax Administration Office, which will be attached to the Ministry of Finance. No separate bureaus will be established in the provinces and cities; instead, the central government or land tax authorities will concurrently handle the affairs to save expenses. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Chamber of Commerce has requested the Ministry of Finance to abolish all harsh and miscellaneous taxes before starting to collect income tax. According to the Ministry of Finance, considerable efforts have been made to abolish harsh and miscellaneous taxes in recent years, but to abolish all harsh and miscellaneous taxes, it is necessary to wait for the promotion of good taxes to be fully beneficial, so that the problem can be solved easily.

The river surface, which was usually only a few feet wide, is now five or six li wide. Because most of the river flows along ditches, the water is rapid and turbulent.

<h3 id="e15">Road Construction Workers in Wuxi Destroy the Public Security Sub-Bureau; All Prisoners in the Bureau Released; All Shops in the Town Closed Down and Went on Strike <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Wuxi) Over ten road construction workers building the highway between Suzhou and Wuxi forcibly borrowed the house of an elderly woman, Hua Zhang, in Zhouxinbo Liuxiangchang in the 3rd District of Wuxi this afternoon around 3:00 pm. Because they were refused, the workers used iron hoes to beat Hua Zhang severely, and a hole was pierced in her right shoulder. At that time, the woman's son, Hua Rongquan, witnessed his mother being injured, and his chest was filled with resentment. Because the workers were unreasonable, he rushed to report to the town chief Shao Zhiliang, the bao chief Xu Xiyan, and others for help. Shao and Yan went forward to persuade the workers, but they were instead imprisoned. Fortunately, the villagers learned of this and quickly reported it to the 8th Branch of the Public Security Bureau, which was responsible for the area. The director, Zheng Qiqiang, quickly led all the police officers to suppress the situation and ordered the town chief and others to be sent back. However, the workers were stubbornly unyielding, so six of the ringleaders were arrested first. Unexpectedly, the other road construction workers learned of this and gathered over 300 workers, who rushed to the 8th Sub-Bureau. They first snatched sixteen guns from the police officers of the bureau. All the objects in the bureau were destroyed. Bureau Chief Zheng Qiqiang was also beaten. All the prisoners in the bureau and the six workers previously arrested were released. The situation became chaotic and serious. All the shops in the town closed down and went on strike. The 8th Sub-Bureau saw that the situation was expanding and the workers' riot was intensifying, so they urgently notified the 36th Division Command stationed in Wuxi and the Wuxi Public Security Bureau to jointly dispatch armed military police to suppress the situation. Conflicts almost broke out between the two sides, and seeing that the workers even intended to seize weapons, they had no choice but to open fire, knocking down two ringleaders, and capturing ninety people alive. The situation was slightly stabilized, and they were immediately dispersed. The arrested workers were all escorted back to the Wuxi Public Security Bureau for temporary detention. After interrogation, it was found that five people were unrelated to the case and were released. The remaining eighty-five people were still remanded in custody. In addition to telegraphing the situation to the provincial government, all the captured criminals will be sent to the Second District Commissioner's Office for interrogation.

<h3 id="e16">How to Eradicate Corruption <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The Guangdong General Labor Union of Machinery Workers and the Guangdong General Labor Union and other groups recently submitted a letter to Chairman Jiang, requesting him to investigate the following cases: (1) The theft case from the Guangzhou Treasury; (2) The case of stealing unissued banknotes worth 70,000 yuan from the Municipal Bank; (3) The case of corruption involving over 4 million yuan in treasury bonds; (4) The case of deducting commissions from the monopoly of tungsten ore; (5) The case of making profits from the monopoly of transporting cement to a certain country; (6) The case of smuggling in the specialized transport of sugar factories; (7) The case of manufacturing counterfeit money for sale. These seven corruption cases occurred during Chen Jitang's term of office. The nature of these cases is extremely serious, and the harm is extremely deep. However, the 30 million people of Guangdong have been enduring this until Chen Jitang stepped down and received the protection of foreign forces, and only then were they able to fully expose these shocking corruption cases. From this point, we can understand that the poison of corruption in political institutions is not easy to eliminate.</p>
<p>Chen Jitang spent many years of hard work training over 100,000 elite troops, believing that he could maintain his control over Guangdong. Unexpectedly, a single order from the Central Government completely disintegrated his power. The fundamental reason why his downfall was so easy was the tyrannical and corrupt behavior of him and his cronies. Everyone knows this.</p>
<p>However, this kind of downfall is not enough to teach a lesson to the military and officials who harbor corrupt intentions. Because people living under the current social system all have the instinct to love money, and corrupt intentions are cultivated from this common instinct when abusing power. All corrupt military and officials have two goals. The first goal is to maintain or increase their power and position. The second goal is to become rich. Chen Jitang's downfall this time certainly made him lose his first goal, but his second goal was still achieved. During his term of office, he plundered all the wealth of Guangdong. After his failure, he and several of his cronies even took away some of the remaining cash in the provincial treasury. Although the Ministry of Finance has ordered the Guangdong authorities to strictly investigate, how much possibility is there to recover the public funds taken away from them when they are under the protection of foreign forces? Chen Jitang, Chen Weizhou, and their kind have ultimately become the richest people in China.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is not just Chen Jitang and others who have stepped down in this way. Which of the fallen warlords and bureaucrats in the past did not step down like this? Someone said that there are no real capitalists in China today; there are only former warlords and bureaucrats. We only need to check the list of shareholders of many large banks and companies to know that this statement has a considerable basis. The reason why China is so poor and in such a critical situation today can indeed be entirely attributed to the corruption of warlords and bureaucrats in the past. Because foreign troubles are also connected to domestic corruption.</p>
<p>The Chinese government, which has been baptized by the revolution, clearly understands this principle. The establishment of the supervisory system and the promotion of clean government are all to prevent corruption among the military and officials. However, to fundamentally eliminate their corrupt intentions, there is an even more important prerequisite. We know that corruption is most likely to grow in places where civil rights are least developed. Because, as mentioned earlier, corrupt intentions arise from the abuse of power by military and officials. Only by unleashing the power of the people and making the military and officials abide by their duties can we effectively eradicate corruption.</p>
<p>The few talks that Yu Hanmou gave after returning to the division were indeed very capable of catering to the psychology of the general public who hated corrupt politics. He said that from now on, he would focus on training the military and never interfere in politics, and he was determined to reduce the size of the army so that Guangdong's military expenditure would be reduced from 6 million to 3 million yuan per month. This indicates that he wants to adhere to the duties of a soldier. Yu also advocated the implementation of the following three points when reporting to the provincial government's memorial week a few days ago: (1) Opening up speech; (2) Respecting the rule of law; (3) Restoring the inherent national spirit. This indicates that he wants to unleash the power of the people. Only by earnestly implementing the propositions made by Yu can we thoroughly clear the haze of corruption. We further hope that not only Guangdong province will do this, but other provinces will also do this.</p>

<p>(London) It is rumored here that China is currently seeking to raise large sums of money for economic development. According to rumors, the total amount of this loan is 20 million pounds, and it is said that it will be undertaken by England, France, Belgium, and Japan. All financiers attach importance to the political importance of the common interests of the four countries after China's consolidation and solemnly declare that these negotiations are bound to be complicated and cannot be completed in a short time. The collateral for the loan is also quite difficult. At the same time, Japan has been constantly probing to seek the understanding of England, which has aroused general attention. A recent example is the article published in the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on July 28, which strongly advocated the importance of restoring Anglo-Japanese friendship. As far as we know, Japan has not yet made any diplomatic probes, but there is a strong possibility of this in the future. The power of extremists in Japanese diplomatic policy is said to be one of the major difficulties. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The English government's economic advisor Frederick Leith-Ross has stayed in the Far East for a long time and has now returned to England. The "Pravda" newspaper has specially written an article discussing the conflict between England and Japan in China as follows:</p>
<p>The newspaper referred to Ross's visit to Japan, saying, "Japan has expressed its rejection of the joint plunder of China by England and Japan, because it must monopolize the right to plunder that country. Ross's failed activities in Japan led him to turn to China, not only failing to obtain Japanese cooperation, but also wanting to oppose Japanese interests. The financial reform of China was undoubtedly suggested to the Nanjing government by Ross. Although this reform has been rejected by all parties, it has been stabilized by relying on short-term loans provided by the English Commercial Bank of Shanghai to the Chinese Commercial Bank. Ross not only helped China implement currency reform, causing active conflict with Japan, but also expressed direct anti-Japanese remarks regarding Japan's attempt to completely seize the provinces of North China. Partly due to Ross's activities, Japan had to temporarily postpone its North China invasion plan and make this invasion more disguised."</p>
<p>"Because of London's assistance, China's currency reform was successful. This move will inevitably hinder Japan's invasion of China. Therefore, Japan will inevitably adopt various methods to oppose it. One of the methods is to smuggle in North China, cutting off the Chinese government's largest source of revenue—tariffs."</p>
<p>The newspaper concluded, "Judging from newspaper reports, the British community has probably reached the conclusion that cooperation between England and Japan is impossible, and England can only act alone in China." (28th TASS Telegram)</p>

<p>(San Francisco) According to Dr. Zhu Youyu, a professor at St. John's University in Shanghai, in a speech to the International Studies Society at Mills College, although China has been subjected to Russian and Japanese aggression, the National Government is still the best government China has had in the last two hundred years and is indeed the key to China's revival. To understand the current situation in China, one must know that China was once a closed-off country, but now times have changed, and it is no longer possible to remain isolated. The current situation in China can be summarized in one sentence: its people are an ancient people, and they are now engaged in building a new country. Political unification is the first step, which has been achieved by building a strong central government. The National Government has been consolidating since its establishment in 1927. Internal construction can be demonstrated by the widespread adoption of education. In 1913, there were a total of 2.8 million children enrolled in schools; by 1931, this had increased to 11 million. Although this number is a drop in the ocean when considering the entire population, such an achievement is no easy feat. Dr. Zhu also stated that China's internal consolidation efforts have been made more difficult by the aggression of its neighbors. It is generally believed that Japan's aggression towards Eastern countries has become increasingly aggressive in recent years out of concern that China's national strength is growing. For example, when Japan invaded the three northeastern provinces of China in 1931, it coincided with a period of significant progress in the political development of the three northeastern provinces, which seems no coincidence. Recently, when China implemented its new currency policy, Japan disrupted China's finances and engaged in large-scale smuggling in North China, causing China to lose customs duties of nearly 2.4 million yuan per week. In short, the situation in the Far East is not optimistic, and a crisis is imminent. (End) (National News Agency, 28th)</p>

<p>Singapore Correspondence The Singapore military authorities now wish to teach 5,000,000 people, speaking a complex variety of dialects and living in narrow alleys and slums, how to practice with gas masks. This is indeed a difficult problem. Although precise arrangements have been made for the protection of the various military strongholds and major enterprises on the island of Singapore, the need to translate the "gas mask teaching method" into Chinese must tax the brains of the Chinese Affairs Commissioners there. Moreover, it is feared that various religious groups among the Asian overseas Chinese may oppose wearing gas masks due to religious superstitions. As for the effects of mustard gas and other types of poisonous gases in the tropics, several experimenters have long tested them, and local manufacturing experts have been engaged to manufacture a mask that can resist the climate here. The government will soon issue a statement discussing the entire air defense problem. It is reported that Singapore will thereafter be placed in the same position as Hong Kong and Columbus, and a large number of cheap gas masks will be stored for distribution. Although Singapore is geographically less likely to be attacked than other major cities in the Far East, the authorities dare not slacken off in all defenses and risk danger. At present, in addition to the original three squadrons of Royal Air Force bombers and comprehensive air defense equipment, Singapore also has a squadron of volunteer air force. Before the end of September this year, this squadron will have six Hawker Audax interceptors listed in the air force and will formulate a procedure to expand the air force in the next three years.

<p>(London) It has recently been rumored that negotiations between the Soviet Union and Britain for a loan have been successful. According to financial circles, what has now been established between the two countries is a financial agreement. Britain does not directly lend to the Soviet Union, but only allows British export merchants to allow the Soviet Union to buy goods on credit, which is guaranteed by the British government. The government originally planned to announce this at the end of this week, after the adjournment of parliament, to avoid questions from members, but now that rumors have spread widely, it may be forced to issue a formal statement tomorrow.

<p>(London) Well-informed sources in financial circles here recently announced that negotiations between the Soviet Union and Britain for a loan were concluded last night. The loan amount is 10 million pounds, with a term of ten years and an annual interest rate of 5.5%. (According to reports, these negotiations began six months ago. The proposed method at that time was for Britain to lend 40 million pounds to the Soviet Union for a term of 20 years and an annual interest rate of up to 6%. In addition, the British government would issue domestic bonds of the same amount with an annual interest rate of 2% to cover this loan. The difference in interest rates would be used to settle the debts owed by Imperial Russia to Britain). (Havas News Agency, 29th)</p>

<p>(London) News received here today from Andai says that 400 rebels in San Sebastián, who had entrenched themselves in the Lodiola barracks, have surrendered after being bombarded by government troops with machine guns. A column of government troops from San Sebastián and Irun is now besieging Sircos, where the rebel deputy commander General Moore's headquarters are located. Another government force is advancing westward along the coast, occupying and controlling various positions in Vouvidu, which is also one of the important positions occupied by the rebels. The fighting in Madrid has temporarily subsided. It is expected that this calm will not last long. It is reported that the rebel leader General Franco has arrived in Spain from Morocco and intends to lead a large army to attack the capital. Today, according to a public bulletin issued by the government, government forces will take a broad offensive in the coming days in order to quell the rebellion. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Andai City, France Rumbling artillery fire has recently been heard here, seemingly coming from the direction of San Sebastián (the capital of Guipúzcoa province) in Spain. Yesterday, it was heard that government troops had recovered the villages of Voissen and Lenttria. In light of the news obtained today, this news is probably credible. At present, the rebels in the area from San Sebastián to Irun have been cleared. Peace has also been restored between San Sebastián, Irun, and Voissen. The same is true for Fuenterrabía. The morale of the government troops has been greatly boosted since the surrender of the rebels in Lodiola some time ago. Civilian groups belonging to the People's Front recently paraded through the streets of San Sebastián to celebrate. In addition, the anti-fascist committee organized by Spanish wounded in Toulouse, France, has recently recruited a volunteer team of 50 people, who have crossed the border to return to the country to serve.

<p>Barcelona Zaragoza is the main base of the rebels in the north. Its location is a major military strong point in Spain, with its perilous terrain, powerful forces (at least ten regiments are stationed there in peacetime), and sophisticated military equipment being second to none in the country. Before the outbreak of the unrest, the rebel leader had already hidden in the area and secretly plotted a change, using this source to incite troops stationed in various parts of the country. Therefore, the government troops are determined to capture the city, and their preparations have been doubled. Thousands of government troops are now waiting in the front line for orders to attack, but it is generally believed that the government authorities will wait until they are sure of victory before ordering an attack, otherwise reckless action would be enough to spoil things. The people of the whole country also know that this fierce battle will determine the outcome of the overall situation and are now looking forward to it. According to some sources, the government troops in Barcelona have dispatched several aircraft and patrol teams today to scout the movements of the enemy, but they have not seen the rebel hideout. Another air force detachment has circled around Huesca. The rebels concentrated there fled in all directions when they heard the sound of the aircraft. In addition, government troops have transferred three artillery teams from Mataró to help in the war. This artillery team is commanded by Captain Medrano, a well-known military leader of the Republican Party, and has recently set off for the front. (Havas News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Madrid Government forces and rebels have repeatedly fought fiercely in the northern mountains, advancing and retreating, and have now reached a stage of mutual injury. The rebels have repeatedly failed to attack and are now reorganizing their lines. Government forces still want to take the offensive. Mola, the commander of the rebels in the north, is currently concentrating his troops in Medina-Celia, 95 miles northwest of Madrid, preparing to hold on to the corner. The rebels in the Guadarrama Mountains are holding on to one end of the mountain ridge. Whether the rebels can successfully attack the capital depends on the battle of Guadarrama. The rebels are indeed confident of winning this battle. Government leaders, workers, and leftists often go to the front to encourage the army. (National News Agency, 28th)</p>

<p>Madrid: In the past twenty-four hours, the situation of the unrest within Spain seems to have slightly calmed, but there are currently still three important battles in progress. The final success or failure will likely be determined in a matter of days or hours. In southwestern Spain, several columns of rebel forces launched from the eastern coast of Spain are advancing towards Seville. The water and electricity supply to Seville has been cut off. In the north, the Barcelona troops have mobilized and are attacking Zaragoza. In the mountains north of Madrid, 12,000 militiamen are continuing fierce battles with General Mola's advance troops. The troops loyal to the government are disregarding the rain and cold weather, making every effort to repel the rebel forces in the Madrid area. The rebel forces there have requested reinforcements. Spanish Army Chief General Costillo, right-wing leader Caballero, and Communist female parliamentarian Ira Lulu visited the government army yesterday. Among the troops, there were many parliamentarians and sixty bullfighting heroes. During the fighting in the mountains near Madrid, a hero named Captain Pique led a suicide squad and destroyed a rebel ammunition depot, causing some of the rebel forces to retreat.

On the other hand, the Seville rebel radio station denied all the news from the government, especially the news that General Deliano was preparing to flee, and said that a column departing from Seville had captured Huelva without any effort. (in southern Spain). As for Ayamonte (at the mouth of the Guadiana River west of Huelva, on the border between Spain and Portugal), it will also fall soon. Furthermore, the revolutionary army in Galicia in the northwest is extremely dominant.

<p>Saint-Jean-de-Luz, Southern France: According to the war reports from near San Sebastian in northern Spain today, the government forces have gained the upper hand. The rebel forces suffered defeats in the villages of Oyerecun (south of San Sebastian) and Fontarabie (4 kilometers from Irun), and have now retreated towards the Bidassoa River. Earlier, after the rebel forces entrenched in Renteria surrendered to the government forces, the government forces seized a large amount of ammunition stored in the city, and immediately advanced to Oyerecun Village to attack the rebel forces. After a fierce battle, the rebel forces could not hold out and abandoned the village and fled. However, because traffic between the village and Navarre Province (the rebel base) had been cut off, they retreated to Fontarabie. At 6 PM, government troops pursued them, and another fierce battle broke out. The rebel forces were finally defeated and retreated to the Bidassoa River at 7 PM. It is reported that rebel reinforcements are coming from Pamplona (the capital of Navarre), and it is expected that the two sides will still fight soon. However, after these two battles, the position of the government forces in Guipúzcoa Province has been greatly consolidated. (According to previous information, the situation was quite unfavorable for the government forces) (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>Headquarters of the rebel army on the northern front in Spain: General Mola, commander of the rebel army on the northern front, today launched a charge with a team of elite cavalry against the government army in an attempt to open the Madrid Avenue. Therefore, in the sound of artillery and machine guns, the sound of horses neighing could also be heard. During the close combat, people and animals were not distinguished, and flesh and blood were blurred. The government army's aircraft still flew low and killed many rebel troops. Although General Mola has suffered many setbacks, he is still quite optimistic and said that once he arrives in Madrid, he will reorganize the Spanish army and use a strong military dictatorship to make Spain a great country. "As for the restoration of the monarchy, there is no problem, because this revolution is purely a democratic movement, that is, nationalism opposes internationalism and Spain has always opposed Marxism." Mola also said that he intends to dissolve the left-wing government, and as for what punishment should be given to the leaders who are loyal to the government, it will depend entirely on their respective attitudes. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Regarding the battle situation in the Guadarrama mountain area north of the capital, it has recently been learned that the rebel forces' ammunition depot has been destroyed by a team of government forces. The government announced that it will issue an order for a general attack soon in order to wipe out the rebel forces and win the final victory. According to what our reporter has learned, the war zone is from Guadarrama Village (40 kilometers north of the capital) and extends along the mountainous area. Currently, transportation from the capital to the village is still convenient. The government army has now decided to begin attacking the Somosierra Pass (70 kilometers from the capital) tomorrow. In addition, on the southern route, the Ministry of the Interior announced that General Miaga led a column of government troops and had arrived near Cordoba (northeast of Seville). The rebel forces in Seville are deserting in large numbers, and many villagers in the suburbs are also carrying weapons to counterattack, so the rebel forces are in a very precarious situation. Traffic between Valencia on the southeastern coast and the capital has been restored. Many trucks loaded with food have recently arrived in the capital from there, so there is no need to worry about the food situation for the people. As for the saying that the rebel forces in Toledo and Aranjuez near the capital have all surrendered, it seems to be premature. Only a small number of those who surrendered are still trapped in the palace there, stubbornly resisting. The government has recently dispatched regular troops and assault teams to encircle and suppress them, in order to force them to surrender quickly and capture them. (Havas, 28th)</p>

<p>Andaye, Southern France: Observers from various countries, acting as neutrals, observed the Spanish situation last night. All said that neither the government army nor the rebel army had made any substantial progress. Fierce battles did occur in some places, but there were no major changes in the overall situation. However, the militia under the government army has a more complete organization, a more abundant food supply, and the recent establishment of service groups, so the government army seems to be gradually gaining an advantage. But on the one hand, they hope that the rebel army will return and on the other hand, they wait for an appropriate opportunity to defeat them in one fell swoop. Currently, there is still no important development in the war, so this is the reason. According to a reporter from this agency stationed on the border between France and Spain, the rebel army was defeated in the battle of Oyerecun a few days ago, and the battle was very fierce. The two sides even fought hand-to-hand. The sound of artillery at night was still deafening. According to the latest news, after this defeat of the rebel army, the situation in Guipuzcoa Province seems to be advantageous for the government army.

Government officials now hope that Germany will participate in the Five-Nation Conference to the utmost extent, so they believe that Chamberlain's anti-German remarks in the House of Commons yesterday were inappropriate. Because up to now, the main weapon of German foreign policy has been to be self-sufficient and not to cooperate with other countries. Chamberlain's remarks yesterday may give the country an excuse to continue to adopt an isolation policy, which is the most feared by the United Kingdom. Political figures and newspapers are refraining from criticizing Chamberlain's speech, and the general purpose is to reduce its importance and prevent Germany from paying attention to it.

<h3 id="e63">Relations Between Germany and Czechoslovakia: Negotiate a Ten-Year Non-Aggression Treaty: Three Conditions as Exchange <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the relations between Germany and Czechoslovakia, the diplomatic reporter of the Morning Post recently stated, "As far as I know, Germany will take action in a short period of time. What is the action? It is to propose to Czechoslovakia the conclusion of a ten-year non-aggression treaty, with the following three items as exchange conditions. This condition, one is that the wishes of the German minorities in Czechoslovakia must be satisfied. Two is the establishment of a federal system, and the granting of autonomous rights to German minorities. Three is that the mutual assistance treaty concluded between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union must be abandoned. This proposition has been informally put forward by the leader of the German minority in Czechoslovakia, that is, the leader of the Sudeten German Party of the Germanism School, Hanlun (who recently visited the United Kingdom). If this can be realized, then the Czech problem can be solved after the Austrian problem. In addition, the ten-year non-aggression treaty concluded between Poland and Germany is also continuously valid. In this way, German Führer Hitler has sufficient reason to demand that the scope of the future Five-Nation Conference be restricted and not expanded. However, the Czechoslovak authorities may not necessarily accept Hitler's claim regarding the country's minorities, because as far as I (the newspaper's diplomatic reporter claims) know, the Czechoslovak government is willing to consider the legitimate wishes of the German minority, but it believes that the federal system is difficult to implement.

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry, in order to strengthen diplomacy with the Soviet Union, had decided to reassign Vice Minister Shigemitsu as the ambassador to the Soviet Union. However, due to objections from the Army, it was proposed to promote and reassign Director-General of the European and Asian Affairs Bureau, Tōgō, as the ambassador. However, Tōgō is currently handling the Manchurian-Mongolian border dispute and it may be difficult for him to leave Tokyo immediately. Therefore, the voices for Swiss Minister Hotta and Dutch Minister Taketomi are also quite high. However, the Army has recently strongly advocated for personnel advancement and a complete change of the embassy's leadership. The Foreign Ministry is reportedly finding it difficult due to this interference. (29th, Reuter's)</p>

<p>(London) Negotiations between Britain and Italy to restore trade relations, which began after the lifting of sanctions against Italy, have been temporarily suspended because the Italian side is unable to accept the minimum condition proposed by Britain to clear approximately two to three million pounds of old debts. Belgium has also suspended its negotiations with Italy for the same reason. Although the Netherlands and France are also encountering similar difficulties, they are continuing negotiations. Since no agreement has been reached between Britain and Italy, British firms will be responsible for any goods exported to Italy. In other words, trade between the two countries will be limited to a small amount. (29th, Reuter's)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Dr. Yamahira Ichizo, a professor at Tohoku Imperial University in Japan, recently invented an underwater wireless telephone. As a result of a public demonstration conducted off the port of Shiogama the other day, the clarity of the voice was no less than that of wired or wireless telephones. It was found that the current used on that day was only 5 watts, yet it was able to communicate freely in water at a distance of 500 meters. Therefore, if a high degree of power is used, it will undoubtedly be successful for long-distance communication. The Japanese Navy is paying close attention to this and plans to apply it immediately to communication between submarines. (28th, China United Press)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The order for the reshuffle of senior officers of the Japanese garrison in North China was supposed to arrive in Tianjin on the 29th, but due to radio interference in Moji, it will arrive on the 30th. Senior Staff Officer Ishii said that August is the month for the regular reshuffle of the army. Until the order arrives, no one knows who will be transferred from the North China garrison. My term is also coming to an end, and I may be transferred back to Japan. There are no major issues in North China recently. Economic cooperation between China and Japan is still under study and has not been finalized. The military has no intention of consulting with the embassy together. Itagaki is currently attached to the First Division's garrison unit and there is no news of him coming to China. Japanese economic cooperation with North China is entirely out of goodwill and there is no malicious intent to invest tens of millions to make North China prosperous and the rural areas revive, restoring the purchasing power of farmers to what it was ten years ago. Japanese economic problems will then be resolved accordingly. However, if the Chinese side, as the host, is unwilling to accept this good intention, it is not convenient to force it. Recently, the military has been paying attention to two points: (1) railways, and (2) water conservancy. They have hired a water conservancy expert, Dr. Sakamoto, and two assistants to work in North China. He is the only water conservancy talent in Japan and has achieved results in managing the rivers in Osaka. After a three-month investigation, he has drawn up a plan and is confident that he can prevent the disasters of the Hai River and Yongding River. The military trusts him very much, and future economic development may begin with this. (29th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Dr. Sakamoto, an expert in land, civil engineering, and water conservancy from the Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs, was invited by the Japanese Garrison in North China to investigate water conservancy plans for the Yongding River and Hai River in the four provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan, using Japanese techniques to develop the two rivers. After working for three months, he has drawn up a plan and has recently returned to Japan to report to the four ministries of Foreign Affairs, Home Affairs, Colonial Affairs, and the Army.

Tax revenue has decreased again in March, and there are almost no reports of tax payments for foreign sugar and rayon.

However, Article 12 of the National Assembly Election Law stipulates that candidates in each electoral district should be people within that electoral district. Therefore, how should the nomination of candidates be handled? (2) Can vocational and professional organizations that are being reorganized be considered legally established? (3) Should the representatives of the Pinghan Railway elect separately? (4) The Lawyers Association has filed for registration with the local court but has not registered with the competent authority. How should it be handled?

<h3 id="e83">Hankou Workers' Leader Wang Jinxia Shot; Seriously Injured; One Assailant Captured on the Spot; Central People's Training Committee Telegraphed Hankou to Inquire About the Incident <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Wang Jinxia, director of the Hankou Dockworkers' Union, once represented Hankou at the National Assembly and also represented China at the 19th International Labor Conference last year. After returning from Europe, he resumed his original position. As a dockworker, he has been the leader of the Hankou labor community for nine years. Recently, he was suddenly shot and seriously injured, and his life may be in danger. It is said that there are more than twenty assailants, and only one was captured on the spot. It is believed to be an organized and planned action. After the incident occurred, society paid close attention to it. The Central People's Training Department of the Kuomintang telegraphed the Hankou Municipal Party Department to inquire about the incident for verification. The reporter visited Wang and saw that his face was red and swollen, his upper lip was broken by an iron rod, his hands and feet were bandaged, and he was spitting blood from his mouth. Due to the severity of his injuries, he could not talk much. He showed me the report submitted to the Central Standing Committee and the Central People's Training Department, which stated: "Hu Dingshan, the executive director of the union, Shi Zhonglin, a dismissed employee of the dock management office, Yuan Zhihua, a clerk of the 13th branch of the dock, and the gangsters Liu Musheng, Yi Xiangtai, and Li Haigou, etc., secretly formed a secret organization called the Patriotic Salvation Corps, intending to sabotage the labor movement. Because I refused to be used by them, they repeatedly threatened me and sent letters of intimidation through Shi Zhonglin twice, which I ignored. On the morning of June 16th, Shi Zhonglin asked me to talk. At 9:00 am that morning, Shi Zhonglin, Hu Dingshan, and Huang Huashan, director of the dockworkers' union, came to my house. Shi raised several points: 1. The National Assembly is approaching, and some people in our organization are running for election. Please do not hinder our progress. If you continue to oppress the lower-level comrades, we will be sorry for you. 2. Fang Duanru, a clerk in the 3rd branch, should be dismissed immediately and replaced by Xiao Zhenxian. 3. Please join the Patriotic Salvation Corps organized by us." The wording was strict, and he waited for a reply. I replied that everyone has the freedom to run for election to the National Assembly and cannot be hindered by others. I have never oppressed anyone. Fang Duanru, a clerk in the 3rd branch, was approved by the 12th meeting of the council on June 10th, and I have no power to dismiss him. As for joining the Patriotic Salvation Corps, because I am a member of the Kuomintang, I cannot join any political organization other than the Kuomintang. Seeing that their threats were unsuccessful and knowing that they could not be subdued by coercion or inducement, they conspired to kill me. At 12:30 pm on the 18th of this month, they gathered more than twenty people, all armed with iron weapons, and ambushed on both sides of Fu Dong Er Road and in the teahouse. When I was passing by on my way home from the union, Shi, Hu, and others rushed forward and dragged me to the ground. The weapons came down together, and I was covered in injuries, trying to kill me. Fortunately, neighbors and the staff of the dockworkers' union and the police heard the sound and gathered, and they fled. The police captured the murderer Liu Musheng on the spot and transferred him to the court. I was admitted to Xiehe Hospital for treatment and have been vomiting blood ever since. I cannot eat or drink, and I am delirious. My injuries are getting worse and worse, and my life is in danger. There are hospital injury reports to prove it. Hu and others are either current executive directors or former employees. They are so lawless. I urge you to quickly order the Wuhan Party, government, military, and police agencies to arrest Hu and others and severely punish them according to law, and thoroughly investigate their illegal organization to eliminate hidden dangers, maintain the labor movement, and protect the safety of party members' lives."

It is famous both domestically and internationally for its gypsum and salt production, along with hot springs and lingzhi mushrooms, collectively known as the "Three Treasures." Due to the urgency of my business, I was unable to fulfill my desire for sightseeing. On July 25th, the Provincial Highway Bureau hosted a press tour to inspect the construction of the Hanyi Road, giving me the opportunity to visit. I traveled around the gypsum mines and salt fields, rural villages and towns, admiring the immortal herbs, truly blessed with spiritual energy, and sampling the warm waters, comparable to those of Huaqing Palace. People marveled at its wonders, and I felt my body further nourished. I record my journey to share with readers.</p>
<p>Things Seen and Heard Along the Way</p>
<p>On July 25th, at 4 p.m., I and a dozen colleagues gathered at Jianghan Customs and boarded a vehicle to set off along Hanyi Road. Zhu Yuanqing, Secretary of the Provincial Highway Bureau, Yi Rong, the section chief of the Western Hubei section, and others accompanied us. Passing through Qiaokou, Duoluokou, and X溝, we were still within the jurisdiction of Wuhan. Recalling the floods of last year, the areas of Duoluokou and X溝 were submerged in vast waters, and the roads were completely destroyed. It hasn't been long since then, but they have already been repaired. The road surface and bridges have been completely renewed. Further west, we reached Xin'andu, belonging to Hanchuan County. Ferries were used to transport the vehicles across the river, as if traveling on flat ground. Manjiagang is the intersection of Hanchuan, Yunmeng, and Xiaogan counties, commonly known as the "Three No-Man's Land." Changfapu is a relatively large town, with the east side of the river belonging to Yunmeng and the west side belonging to Yingcheng. Similar to Manjiagang, it required crossing by boat. Further west, we arrived in Yingcheng County. Due to the pre-arranged itinerary, we did not disembark and crossed the county river, making this our fourth river crossing. Soon after, we reached Zaoshi, with thousands of houses, tall buildings, and mansions coming into view. This place belongs to Tianmen. In previous years, it was the area where He Long, Duan Dechang, and other bandits roamed. Because the bandits regarded it as a nest, it was not burned down. Now, a city gate called Taiping Gate (Peace Gate) has been built to commemorate the chaos. At the Sanwen intersection beside the train station, there were five members of the local militia team standing guard with spears. One of them had a pensive face and was over sixty years old. The others were thirteen or fourteen years old, with one underaged member only about ten years old. The banner read "Tianmen Sixth District, Seventy-Third Bao (Neighborhood) Squad." Apart from one who could be considered a strong man, the other four were either old or weak. Using them to defend against bandits is truly a mockery of the world. Further ahead, the road diverged. Turning north, we quickly reached Wenquan (Hot Spring) Township, which is a famous scenic spot of Yingcheng. It was already dusk, and the sound of frogs filled the fields. Mountain children played with calves, and the towering trees seemed to touch the sky, making one feel as if they were in a painting. From Hankou to Zaoshi, we passed through six counties, which is the eastern section of Hanyi Road. The road was built on the roadbed of the Chuanhan Railway. Each station along the way has a platform, and the bridge piers and culverts all have foundations. With the Highway Bureau's maintenance, the road surface is paved with stone, as smooth as a whetstone. Driving is safe and unhindered by wind or rain. Among all the highways in the province, it is undoubtedly the best. Besides the road improvement, which was quite satisfactory, the agricultural products seen along the way, such as cotton, rice, and sorghum, were all thriving. It was said that the rice in Yingcheng even had double ears (two grains per stalk), promising a good harvest. I couldn't help but feel excited.</p>
<p>Trying the Baths at Tangchi (Hot Spring Pool)</p>
<p>Tangchi is located west of Yingcheng County, surrounded by mountains and forests, with a tranquil and secluded landscape. There are three hot springs, each several feet apart. The area has a small village named after the hot springs. The water from the hot springs comes from deep underground and gushes upwards, with a slight sulfurous odor, boiling year-round, and a very abundant source. They were formerly divided into the First Pool, Second Pool, and Third Pool. Villagers all draw water into their homes for bathing, which can cure skin diseases. It has been famous since the Sui Dynasty. The Geography section of the Book of Sui mentions, "Yingyang has hot springs," referring to this place. Throughout history, famous figures have written poems about this place. The most famous is Li Bai. Li Bai's poem says, "The goddess disappeared into the secluded realm, the hot spring baths the great river. Yin and Yang unite the burning charcoal, and creation opens the spiritual spring. The bottom of the pool glows with crimson fire, and the sand emits pure smoke. Boiling pearls shine like the bright moon, and the bright mirror reflects the empty sky. The fragrance of orchids fills the air, and the color of peach blossoms is vibrant. A close inspection reveals myriad differences, and a secret passage connects seven marshes. Healing wounds is unsurpassed, and transformation fulfills the Tao. The rinsing water is clear and refreshing, and drying hair is done near the babbling stream. It is scattered down the Chu kingdom and divided to irrigate Song Yu's fields. It could be used to serve imperial visits, but alas, it is isolated and remote. Only following the water heading towards the court, it offers its meager contribution to the sea." Also, Qing Dynasty poet Xi Dazhuang wrote, "Ten thousand bushels of flowing spring everywhere bring spring, and from the beginning, its heat does not depend on people. The source is lively and the waves are misty, and heaven bestows on us a good place to cleanse ourselves. Lush water mist fills the air, and a harmonious vitality wants to penetrate the skin. Everywhere, the grace of the waves is warm, as if one is in the Phoenix Pool. Washing away worldly dust is also pleasing, and drying hair in the breeze as the sun sets. Surprisingly reciting the verses of Qinglian (Li Bai), I look up at the white clouds with deep admiration for the past." Currently, Tangchi has renovated bathrooms and a beautiful hotel for tourists to bathe and stay. I unpacked in the hotel and took a bath at night, enjoying the clear waves immensely. After the bath, I immediately felt a breeze under my armpits, with a lightness as if wanting to ascend to immortality. On the morning of the 26th, I went for another bath and visited the First Pool and Second Pool. Hot air steamed, condensing into fog. Looking down, the boiling springs surged upwards, like drops of pearls. On one side of the First Pool, the water was cool and clear, with fish and shrimp swimming in it, truly showing the wonders of creation.</p>
<p>Rural Survey</p>
<p>Tangchi itself is a rural village, and a rural improvement experimental zone has been established, dividing into agricultural-forestry cooperation, militia training, popular night schools, elementary school, medicine, and animal husbandry departments, with the main goals of implementing rural education, cultivating farmers' morals, improving farming skills, and increasing agricultural and forestry production. Since its establishment in the 23rd year (of the Republic), in the first year, over eighty mu of land was rented for cultivation, and the harvest was doubled compared to before. After the 24th year, the focus was on public training for self-defense, emphasizing water conservancy, expanding afforestation, textile, rice milling, oil pressing, and animal husbandry industries, as well as handling credit and marketing cooperation, in order to adjust the rural economy. The results have been quite impressive. Former Provincial Committee member and Director of the Construction Department, Li Fan, lives here after leaving office, also working on rural reconstruction. In Tangchi, there are windmills and granaries, etc. The windmills are used to remove chaff, and the granaries are used for storage, all to benefit the farmers, and no fees are charged. Li also bought 500 mu of land at Guanyin Rock, 30 li from here, and developed it into a farm. Every day, he wears a straw hat and goes barefoot, traveling 60 li back and forth, personally inspecting the fields once, not considering it a hardship. He is also an extraordinary person. As for the general situation of the rural areas in the whole county, after investigation and interviews, the whole area has more fields than land, with rice, wheat, and beans as the main agricultural products, followed by sesame, and then cotton. The area is measured in dan and dou (traditional units of volume), and transactions are based on qiu (mounds) and duan (sections). Roughly two dou and five, are implicitly equal to one mu (a unit of area). Upper-grade fields produce two shi (another unit of volume) of wheat and three shi of grain per mu. Middle-grade fields produce one shi and six dou of wheat and two shi and five dou of grain. Lower-grade fields produce one shi and two dou of wheat and two shi of grain. During the off-season, farmers all have side jobs. Farmers in the northwest mostly transport gypsum and salt with mules and horses, or work as laborers in the salt mines. Farmers in the east mostly go to Wuhan to sell their labor. Those in the south mostly fish and gather firewood. Fields are divided into six grades, and regular and supplementary taxes are paid together. The highest is 4 jiao and 7 fen per mu, and the lowest is 3 jiao and 0.8 li.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the County Seat</p>
<p>At noon on the 26th, we left Tangchi and returned, traveling 30 li to Yingcheng County. We got off the car and entered the city. The streets were relatively clean. There were the Yingcheng Yinhao Bank, Weizhang Hospital, Shengjia Jewelry Store, Xinguang Photo Studio, Yingyi Restaurant, etc. Educational institutions included a junior high school, and judicial institutions included a local court. The amusement venue was Zhongshan Park. Inside the park was a memorial pavilion commemorating the patriotic student movement last year, which resulted in an incident due to misunderstandings. I heard that lingzhi mushrooms were currently stored in the library of the People's Education Center, so I made a special trip to visit. The center was located on the old site of the Confucian temple, with ancient cypress trees reaching the sky and green shade covering the ground. With the introduction of Zhang Yuezhong, the section chief of the county government, I met the director of the center, Peng Wenbin, and was able to see the lingzhi mushrooms. They were produced in Wujia Mountain. They had no peculiar smell. The mushroom had a single stem and was shaped like a ruyi (a curved decorative object symbolizing good fortune), with a crimson color. It is commonly said that consuming it can lead to immortality. Although this is not credible, it is still a special species. The center also displayed iron cannons from the seventh and eighth years of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, weighing 501 jin each, which had historical significance. There was also a tombstone of General Huang from the second year of Emperor Taikang of the Xia Dynasty, which was unearthed at Guifeng Temple last spring. Then, I went to the county government to visit County Magistrate Liu Lixin. He led us to visit the entire office. The most notable were the male and female prisons. The prisons were clean, with ample lighting, and equipped with bathhouses and toilets. There were 50 male prisoners and only 3 female prisoners. Most of the crimes were related to marital disputes. The male prisoners were divided into groups to work, sewing clothes and husking rice, each doing their job. Seeing reporters entering the prison for a visit, they all stood up automatically, showing good manners, indicating that they had received education. According to County Magistrate Liu, the major products of the county are gypsum, salt, local cloth, and grain. The annual gypsum production is over 400,000 tai (loads), worth 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan. The salt production is 140,000 to 150,000 dan, worth 1.6 million yuan. The local cloth production is 3,000 rolls, with 32 pi (bolts) per roll, each pi worth 1 yuan, totaling 10,000 yuan. The living conditions of the rural people are relatively frugal, but the merchants in the city are concentrated here due to the gypsum and salt industries, and their lives are beyond the norm. The children of wealthy families also live very extravagantly. The local customs have become accustomed to extravagance. Efforts are currently being made to correct this. Education in the whole county is relatively developed. There is Xihe Junior High School, an affiliated county-run simplified normal school class, five complete elementary schools, 54 primary schools, one vocational school for women, 15 mobile folk schools, one library, five people's education centers, and five circulating library depots. Gypsum and salt merchants bear a heavy burden of local surtaxes, such as education funds, security funds, and county government funds, which rely on this donation for subsidies, and the education funds rely on it for funding.

<h3 id="e85">Troops Stationed in Chaozhou and Meizhou Awaiting Orders for Post-Conflict Arrangements; Huang Yanzhen and Huang Renhuan Arrived in the Provincial Capital to Seek Instructions; Martial Law Has Also Been Lifted in Chao'an and Shantou <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: In the beginning of Chen Jitang's resignation, the troops stationed in the Dongjiang and Hanjiang regions were frequently mobilized, and rumors were rampant. Eventually, after Yu Hanmou arrived in Guangzhou and the situation stabilized, the various armies received orders from superiors to remain stationed in their original defenses and not move without authorization. The 7th and 8th Divisions of the 3rd Army were therefore stationed in the upper reaches of the Dongjiang River, while Army Commander Huang Yanzhen returned to the provincial capital to meet with Yu, seeking instructions on the issue of downsizing and stationing troops. Army Commander Huang Renhuan of the 4th Army and East District Committee Member Li Yukun also went to the provincial capital on the 23rd, awaiting orders to attend meetings to discuss military post-conflict arrangements. Furthermore, Huang Renhuan's troops shortened their defensive line starting this month, moving the army headquarters from Meixian County to Laolong in the upper reaches of the Dongjiang River. The 10th Division, led by Zeng Youren, retreated from Jiaoling and Meixian to the mountains of Wuhua, stationed in Anliu and Hepo, and was mutually vigilant with the 9th Division stationed in Dianning. The 11th Division, led by Yan Tingyu, was stationed in Fengshun City. The 12th Division, led by Chen Hanguang, was transferred to the Xijiang South Road, leaving only the regiment led by Deputy Division Commander Peng Zhifang stationed in Chao'an City. When the 3rd and 4th Armies were redeployed, rumors were rampant in various places, and counties, districts, and villages imposed martial law. Subsequently, on the 22nd, Huang Renhuan telegraphed the division commanders from the provincial capital, ordering them to remain in place and await orders, which somewhat eased the situation. On the 23rd, martial law was also lifted in Shantou, but military police still jointly patrolled the city in armed vehicles, or searched travelers at wharves and train stations. Hotels, gambling houses, and opium dens were still subject to inspections. The same was true in Chao'an. However, people's hearts were greatly calmed. (24th)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Japanese in the Northeast Promote a New Agricultural Policy; Establish a Fundamental Plan for Agricultural Development; In Reality, Preparing for War Against Soviet Russia <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: Since the Japanese created a puppet regime in the Northeast, all kinds of construction work have been completely controlled by the Japanese. According to their claims, the first phase of work has come to an end. From now on, they will actively start the second phase of economic construction work, which can exert a great effect on the Soviet Union in terms of national defense. Therefore, the Japanese ordered the authorities of various departments of the puppet regime to implement mobilization preparations. Their concrete construction policy, especially the fundamental plan for developing agriculture, has been thoroughly researched in advance. Now, the puppet Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Civil Affairs, Ministry of Mongolian Affairs, and related departments are ordered to proceed according to this policy. The main plan is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Main Plan</p>
<p>(1) To make the national agricultural experiment institutions complete and enriched. (2) To implement the universal deployment of agricultural instructors stationed in each county. (3) To make the agricultural survey institutions complete and enriched. (4) To cultivate specialized agricultural guidance talents. (5) To organize the national agricultural groups. (6) To perfect the agricultural observation network. (7) To enrich the local industrial encouragement facilities. (8) To construct model villages. (9) To establish an agricultural financial system. (10) To expand the sales channels for special products. (11) To set up agricultural warehouses. (12) To encourage the farmers' autonomous economy. Among the above plans, the increase of the main agricultural crops such as soybeans, sorghum, millet, corn, wheat, cotton, tobacco, and sugar beets is the first step of the work elements.</p>
<p>Agricultural Group Organization</p>
<p>For the convenience of control, the Japanese are implementing their common association doctrine, as the foundation for farmers to become self-reliant. Based on the general idea of ​​this beautiful name, they will order the agricultural groups in various places in the Northeast to implement forceful reorganization, that is, to organize farmers' groups with the farmers' associations as units, and to establish simple common organizations according to the establishment of the district and village system. The farmers' associations will then take a middle position to correct the repayment method, and strive to prevent the exhaustion of finance, and generally privately engage in young seedlings trading and high-interest loans. Currently, the Japanese believe that this plan is the most brilliant.</p>
<p>Warehouse Establishment</p>
<p>In the future, the widespread establishment of agricultural warehouses in various places is, in reality, preparing for food for the war against the Soviet Union, while the Japanese superficially claim to stabilize finance, prevent the general sale of agricultural products and young seedlings trading, and generally engage in sales and other matters, giving the general farmers the benefits they deserve. And first in North Manchuria, in the branches of the puppet Central Bank, the recognized grain stacks and the necessary places for grain inspection, a total of ten places, the above-mentioned agricultural warehouses will be set up to consolidate the agricultural foundation, and then spread to various parts of the Northeast. Regarding the above items, they are now proceeding step by step, and the puppet Ministry of Industry is actively preparing for the formulation of the Farmers' Association Law and the Agricultural Warehouse Law, and it is expected to be announced and implemented at the latest within this year. If so, after the implementation of the above-mentioned new agricultural policy, the shortcomings of the past unregulated agricultural product prices and insufficient supply in the Northeast can be swept away, and the rural situation and the agricultural foundation will become more consolidated.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Songjiang: The Jinshan Mouth Robbery Case Solved <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The home of farmer Pan Jinhuo, in the 6th Jia of the 2nd Bao of the 8th District of Punan (Jinshan Mouth) in the county, was robbed on the evening of the 22nd by seven bandits speaking a local dialect. One person was posted outside as a lookout, while the rest broke through the stove door and entered the house. They tied up Jinhuo's mother with a rope and forced her to reveal where the silver was hidden. Then they overturned boxes and cabinets, searching thoroughly. They escaped with their loot after half an hour, including cotton, broad beans, clothing, and other items. The victim was afraid of incurring the bandits' resentment and did not dare to report to the authorities. It was not until the 26th that the chief of the Shanyang Patrol Station heard about the incident and went to investigate with the security team. According to people in the village, one of the six bandits seemed to be Pan Abu from the village, which raised suspicions of him being an accomplice. Qin Shihuan, the squad leader of the 1st Platoon of the 12th Brigade of the garrison security force stationed in the mountains, immediately led soldiers to arrest Pan Abu in Dongmen Township. The patrol station also reported the results of the investigation, along with a list of lost items, to the bureau to request assistance in apprehending the remaining bandits.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Wuxi: Rice Prices Gradually Decline <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer this year, the climate has been suitable, with timely rainfall, which has greatly benefited the farmland. The local grain market has abundant inventory, and sales are slow. In addition, new xian rice from Zhejiang and Anhui will soon be on the market. Therefore, grain merchants' sentiments have greatly softened, and market prices have gradually declined. Qingbai japonica rice has fallen to 9.1 yuan, a decrease of more than 1 yuan compared to rice prices a few months ago. Currently, the rice crops in the four rural areas are generally thriving. The harvest in the future will surely be bountiful. Therefore, overall, the market is expected to continue to decline. As for the price of wheat, the flour mills have suffered losses due to this year's wet wheat kernels. As a result, operations have been intermittent, and market prices have also become depressed. Yesterday, the price of each bag fell by 2 jiao. In addition, the price of flour has fallen by 6 fen per bag in three or four days. Yesterday's prices were 3.09 yuan per bag for Green Mountain Deer flour and 2.99 yuan per bag for Red Mountain Deer flour.</p>
<h3 id="e89">The Chunyun Smuggling Case Unfolds Again <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>After the railway bureau discovered that the station master, luggage room director, and other staff members of the local railway station had organized a smuggling ring, it dismissed and disciplined the station masters and other related personnel on the 2nd of this month. However, station masters Shi, Wang, and Zhou, as well as freight yard director Ma Ziqing, and yard supervisor Luo Xingchu, among others, petitioned the bureau to appeal their cases. After the management bureau repeatedly sent people to Wuxi to investigate, the truth of the case began to emerge. It is now known that the police department of the two railway lines, because the former section chief of the second section stationed in Wuxi, Zou Yuou, was also related to the main suspect in the smuggling case, Wang Xingen, not only dismissed him, but also discovered that patrolman Liu Ayun of the section was also suspected of participating in smuggling. Therefore, it specifically telegraphed section chief Chen Jie yesterday, ordering him to place Liu Ayun under supervision, and sent two police officers to escort him to Shanghai for interrogation. It is heard that Wang Xingen, the main culprit in the case, has completed his sentence after being dealt with by the police department and has now regained his freedom.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Yangzhou: Altered Stamp Imprint Leads to Tax Collection <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>When Jiangdu County Government processed land declarations and corrections, it was discovered that Chen Ronghe, who held a land ownership certificate for 12.5 mu, had altered the receipt after paying taxes. In the spring, Chen entrusted Ren Mao to file the declaration on his behalf. Ren only filled in 2.2 mu and earned a fine of 1 yuan (calculated at 1 jiao per mu), and only paid 3 jiao. Afterwards, he added the characters "二十" (twenty) to the number of mu, and the characters "一元" (one yuan) to the fine of 3 jiao. Yesterday (the 27th), when Chen came to check the receipt, the discrepancy was discovered. Section Chief Shen found out and summoned Ren for interrogation. Ren confessed without hesitation. He was ordered to be shackled and displayed in front of the main hall granary as a warning, and then sent to the court for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Where is the Hirota Cabinet Going? (9) <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Jia He</p>
<p>Currently, the military and Hirota are heading towards a hand-to-hand struggle, no matter which way you look at it. Reality demands a reckoning of balanced forces. If Hirota continues to take an ambiguous attitude, he will inevitably be rejected by the military. If he follows the military, the zaibatsu (financial conglomerates) will whip him from behind. An open opposition to the military would allow the military to appeal to the Japanese people if their demands are not met. They can point out that Hirota's cabinet's "renovation of all administration" is not true to its name. They can movingly accuse Hirota of forgetting the suffering of the people, failing to accept the military's proposals, and failing to reduce the various burdens of the people. They can also attack Hirota for not establishing a Ministry of Health and neglecting the alarming figures of conscription physical examinations – during the years of Taisho 11 to 15 (1922-1926), the number of conscripts who failed the examination was 250 per thousand, which increased to 350 per thousand during the years of Showa 2 to 7 (1927-1932), and increased again to 400 per thousand the year before last. Finally, they can create another world-shocking event.</p>
<p>There are already many facts that hint to us that the military may rise again. The most important one is that the class division in the country is becoming more obvious. In the past, cabinet member Maeda publicly called on the established political parties to unite and confront the Social Mass Party. Now, due to the strengthening of the left wing, perhaps yesterday's hope can prompt the Japanese ruling class to implement it. Because the All-Japan Federation of Trade Unions, Tokyo Exchange and other eight groups have established the Labor and Peasant Proletarian Council, backed by the Tokyo Exchange anti-Social Mass Party faction, and elected Kato Kanju as the permanent chairman and Suzuki Mosaburo as the secretary-general, as a prelude to the grand union of the legal left wing. Although the strength is weak, it is no longer a heap of loose sand as before. Moreover, the workers in Osaka, under the slogan of "United Front," also have the possibility of breaking the traditional prejudices and uniting. On July 4, Kato dissolved the Labor and Peasant Proletarian Council and began to establish a new, left-leaning, anti-fascist proletarian party, then the power will be even stronger.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the right wing, centered on Yoshida Masuzo of the Japan Production Party, has long called for a patriotic political alliance, Hyogo Prefecture Patriotic Society, New Japan National League, etc., to hold a joint promotion symposium for all patriotic political parties in Osaka. On June 20, another conference was held, with more than 200 representatives wanting to form a "Restoration Party." This is exactly the opposite of Kato's actions. This shows that Hirota's policy is not only unable to embark on the middle way, but also increasingly promotes the division between the left and right wings. The clearer the division, the weaker the foundation for the existence of middle-type, transitional cabinets, and the shorter the life of the Hirota cabinet. When the left wing evolves from verbal propaganda to action, the military will be an indispensable tool for the Japanese ruling class. At that time, the Hirota cabinet will either give way to more radical people, or it will have to undergo another self-denial.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is already in such a gradual process, but when will the mutation occur? That depends on the ebb and flow of the forces of the various classes within Japan, the international situation, and the strength of the Chinese nation's resistance. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e92">Pinghu: All Shops Closed in Xin Cang Town <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Xin Cang Town in this county suddenly declared a market strike on the 22nd of this month. According to the investigation by the Party Department, the Xin Cang District Office was abusing its power and acting arbitrarily. If someone led an ox past its door, and the ox accidentally defecated, the person leading the ox would be arrested, beaten, and fined heavily, and the ox would also be severely beaten. The office set up a smoking cessation center. The staff in the center provided meals to the offenders, but did not pay a single penny for more than two months. When the chef refused to continue contracting, he was arrested and detained in the office. The guarantor of the chef was questioned by the chef's side, and he went to the director of the office to intercede, but he was also arrested and detained. After several days, he was released after the elder Zhou Guiting went to plead for him. The debt was still not paid. This caused resentment everywhere. After the city strictly prohibited shirtless men, Xin Cang immediately followed suit. Those who were arrested for being shirtless were whipped with rattan canes, detained in the office overnight, and fined one yuan before being released. They were not given undershirts like in the city area. A police officer patrolling the street, or so it was said to be the director of the office himself, saw a shirtless man across the river and dug up a stone locust tree on the road and threw it with all his might. On the 22nd, a police officer with a loaded gun box was looking for shirtless people. He broke into He Kang Sauce Garden and ordered all the workers, who were all shirtless, to stop working, which led to a dispute. Someone shouted in the street to quickly close the market, which was immediately echoed by everyone, and the market was closed on the spot. The county government's efforts to persuade were ineffective. On the 24th, the county Party Department sent people to investigate. Tens of thousands of people welcomed them at the pre-station. When they arrived at the town, the victims bared their arms to show their wounds. The staff of the Party Department then decided that the prohibition of shirtless men should wait until the Pinghu New Transport Branch decides on a unified method before it is promoted uniformly throughout the county. The director of the office agreed, and Xin Cang opened all shops in the town on the 25th.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Jiaxing: Hangzhou Customs Investigates Smuggling <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Jiaxing Jiahe Cloth Factory was found by the county investigation team to have 22 boxes of Japanese bleaching powder. Because there were no separate transport documents, it was considered smuggled goods. After sealing them up, it reported to the county government for handling. Subsequently, Zhou Yuqing, the manager of the factory, went to Shanghai to obtain the permit and handed it over to the county. The county sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs, requesting it to investigate and handle the case based on the handling process of the county. It is now known that after the Provincial Party Department received the report from the County Party Department on this case, it sent Fa Guangyu from the Hangzhou Customs on the 28th to Jiaxing by car. He first went to the County Chamber of Commerce to investigate everything. Then, the chamber sent Secretary Shi to accompany him to the Party and government agencies to solicit opinions. Finally, he went to the Jiahe Cloth Factory to conduct an on-site investigation. Fa Guangyu returned to Hangzhou on the same day to report.</p>

Recently, Xu Enpei, the general manager of the Local Bank, went to Shanghai, and the procedures and methods for the takeover have been negotiated with the Bank of China authorities. After Xu returns to Hangzhou, the takeover will begin at the beginning of next month.</p>

<p>Zheng Bingyan, a resident of Zunyi Bridge, located at the border of Xiao and Shao [counties], was in his twilight years. He had only one son, A Yuan, who worked as a machinist in Hangzhou. Each year, he would send money home to support the family, which they were quite content with. Unexpectedly, on the 27th of this month, his son suddenly contracted an epidemic and died in Hangzhou. The machine shop immediately informed Zheng Bingyan and instructed him to come to Hangzhou to collect the body. Upon hearing the news, Bingyan was in a state of bewilderment. In the afternoon, he threw himself into the river and committed suicide. He was rescued by people, but he had already died. His wife, Madam Yu, was of similar age. Upon hearing that her son had died and her husband had also committed suicide, she took advantage of a moment when no one was watching in the evening and hanged herself. Fortunately, neighbors and relatives witnessed this tragedy and helped arrange the funeral.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Shanghai Cultural Organizations Sternly Advise Li Bai <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Guomin She [National Society] reports that the China Cultural Construction Association and 55 other cultural organizations, considering that the Central Government has been lenient and tolerant regarding the recent unrest in Guangdong and Guangxi, not pursuing the matter rigorously and even granting Li Bai a new position, yet up to now, Li Bai has not only failed to express frankness but is also rumored to be resisting orders. Yesterday, they sent a telegram of stern advice and also sent a telegram to Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang, urging them to issue strict orders for service. The original telegram is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Telegram to Li Bai</p>
<p>"Most Urgent. Honored Sirs Li Delin [Zongren] and Bai Jiansheng [Chongxi] of Nanning: It is noted that you have resorted to arms and caused disturbances with the aid of foreign powers. If judged according to party discipline and national law, how could you defend yourselves and apologize to the people of the nation? However, the Central Government, recognizing your past contributions to the revolution, albeit with some merit, cherishes benevolence and urges you to improve yourselves. Therefore, you have been granted the positions of Standing Committee Member of the Military Affairs Commission and Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government to encourage and observe future actions. However, since the announcement of the new appointments, many days have passed, and your attitude remains ambiguous. Reports even suggest that you are inviting wolves into the house and resisting orders. Such obstinate behavior is deeply alarming. Therefore, a special telegram is sent to offer sincere advice. It is hoped that you will appreciate the benevolence of the Central Government and the importance of peaceful unification, and promptly come to Nanjing to take office, joining in the defense against foreign aggression. This is earnestly hoped for. If you still harbor resentment and pursue private separatist ambitions, disregarding the loss of national strength and undermining unification, then party discipline and national law will not tolerate those who harbor disloyalty to procrastinate in this manner. Moreover, the four hundred million compatriots of the nation will never forgive you rebellious individuals. The telegram is urgent. Please take heed. China Cultural Construction Association Shanghai Branch, Shanghai University Faculty and Staff Union, Shanghai University Student Union, Shanghai Middle School Faculty and Staff Union, Shanghai Middle School Student Union, Shanghai French Concession Private Primary and Secondary School Union, Shanghai Women's Advancement Association, Shanghai Youth Reading Club, China Labor Association, China Educational Film Association Shanghai Branch, China Scientific Movement Association Shanghai Branch, Newcomer Weekly, Cultural Construction Monthly, Times Newspaper, Yongjin Biweekly, Shanghai Farmer Monthly, China Postal Worker Monthly, Shanghai Social Education Society, China Boy Scouts Shanghai Municipal Council, Kuangliu Literary Society, Shanghai Cooperative Enterprise Promotion Association, National Reading Mutual Aid Society, Shanghai Unknown Writers Association, China Mental Research Association, and 56 other organizations respectfully submit."</p>
<p>Telegram to Lin and Chiang</p>
<p>"Respectfully submitted to Chairman Lin of the National Government and Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission in Guling. The recent unrest in Guangdong and Guangxi was initiated by Li Bai. According to party discipline and national law, he should be severely punished. The Central Government, considering his past contributions to the revolution, albeit with some merit, has already shown extreme leniency and tolerance by granting him the positions of Standing Committee Member of the Military Affairs Commission and Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government. However, since the announcement of the new appointments, many days have passed, and Li Bai has not only failed to express frankness but is also mobilizing troops and concentrating them in Guangdong and Guangxi. According to reports, Li Bai not only intends to resist orders but also harbors the sinister plan to follow in the footsteps of the Red Bandits, fleeing to various provinces. He would rather sever the national lifeline and the people's lives than refrain from harming the people and the nation. This is abundantly clear. In addition to sending an urgent telegram to Li Bai, offering stern advice, this association respectfully requests that Your Excellencies issue strict orders as soon as possible, ensuring obedience to the Central Government and the completion of unification. If he persists in his obstinacy, then we implore you to prevent future troubles and eliminate evil completely by imposing strict sanctions. Otherwise, nurturing difficulties and indulging evil will be a grave mistake. The situation is urgent. Please take heed. China Cultural Construction Association Shanghai Branch, Shanghai University Faculty and Staff Union, and 56 other organizations respectfully submit."</p>
<p>Please Expedite Action</p>
<p>Also, the Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association believes that the Central Government's handling of the unrest in Guangdong and Guangxi has consistently been characterized by leniency, while Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi still linger in Guangxi, seemingly clinging to their positions. The unfolding situation is fraught with misfortune. Yesterday, they sent a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government, earnestly requesting that, for the sake of national security and the survival of the nation, they clear away obstacles and punish the rebellious. The original telegram is recorded below: "Respectfully submitted to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government. In recent months, the people of the nation have been astonished and bewildered by the unrest in the Southwest. Subsequently, Chen Jitang fled, and the popular sentiment in Guangdong was stabilized. However, Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi still linger in Guangxi, seemingly clinging to their positions. The Central Government has consistently shown leniency, granting new appointments, a truly painstaking effort to achieve a win-win situation for both Guangxi and Li Bai. At this time of national crisis and mounting worries, if Li Bai can truly change course and strive for self-improvement, then he will not be unworthy of the consideration shown by those above and beyond, both domestically and internationally. According to reports in recent days, it is feared that the two gentlemen will not meet the expectations of the people of the nation. If they persist in their obstinacy, the unfolding situation will be fraught with misfortune. It must be understood that to resist foreign aggression, internal stability is essential; to defend against foreign insult, unification is essential. If China today still harbors the remnants of warlord separatism, how can it resist foreign aggression, and how can it defend against foreign insult? The people of the nation yearn for the Central Authorities to clear away obstacles and punish the rebellious for the sake of national security and the survival of the nation. Driven by heartfelt emotions, no indulgence is possible. The telegram is urgent. Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association respectfully submits."</p>
<p>Leave Guangxi Immediately</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Municipal Education Association yesterday sent a telegram to Li Bai, urging them to pull back from the brink and leave Guangxi immediately to apologize to the people of the nation. The original telegram reads: "Respectfully addressed to Li Delin and Bai Jiansheng of Guangxi. Your betrayal of the Party and the nation has been long-standing. According to law, you should have been openly punished. However, the Central Government has shown leniency, not pursuing past transgressions. If you have any conscience, you should repent of your past mistakes, assist the Central Government, and atone for your past sins. Unexpectedly, you have continued on your evil path, colluding with Guangdong and acting as accomplices, offering assistance in order to create a second Eastern Hebei [Autonomous Anti-Communist Council]. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers in Guangdong deeply understood righteousness and resolutely revolted. Your general trend has passed; you are no different from a bird nesting on a curtain or a fish swimming in a boiling cauldron. You should immediately lay down your arms and await punishment to apologize to the people of the nation and preserve your heads. The Central Government has specially issued a special decree, appointing one as the head of Zhejiang Province and entrusting the other with important national defense responsibilities. You should be moved to tears and give your lives in return. How could you dare to resist orders for so long and even collude with enemy generals, totaling more than two thousand people, determined to plunge the nation into an abyss of no return? The people of the nation will all devour your flesh and sleep on your skins. Moreover, since Guangdong has already revolted, Guangxi is isolated, surrounded on all sides, no different from a turtle in a jar. If the Central Government issues a clear order to suppress them, they can be destroyed in short order. Are you not aware of this? It is hoped that you will pull back from the brink and leave Guangxi immediately to protect the people of Guangxi and preserve your own lives. Otherwise, it will be too late to regret. If you persist in your obstinacy, our Central Government should immediately launch a large-scale campaign of punishment, without any further indulgence, to serve as a warning to those who betray the Party and the nation. This association admires your talent and wisdom and therefore does not hesitate to offer you the final advice. We hope you will take it into consideration. Shanghai Municipal Education Association respectfully submits."</p>

<h3 id="e99">Sichuanese in Shanghai Oppose Japan Establishing a Consulate in Chengdu, Write to Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association to Fight for Sovereignty, Shanghai Student Association Forms Anti-Consulate Establishment Association <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Japan's new appointment of Iwai as Consul-General in Chengdu has attracted national attention. The Sichuanese in Shanghai have risen up in opposition. The Sichuanese Student Association in Shanghai held a meeting a few days ago to study the Sino-Japanese treaty relationship and wrote to various Sichuanese organizations in Shanghai to send representatives to attend a joint meeting. It is reported that more than 30 Sichuanese in Shanghai, including Dai Yuebo and Li Jingxi, jointly wrote to the Sichuanese Fellow-Provincials Association, requesting that it convene a general meeting to make a strong statement. The original letter is found below (excerpt omitted): "Chengdu is not a treaty port, so there is no reason to establish a consulate. Moreover, the establishment of a consulate is the initial step towards extraterritoriality. How can we guarantee that there will be no disputes among the people if we allow the establishment of extraterritorial rights? If this happens, not only will our Sichuanese compatriots be subject to unpredictable influences, but the power of friendly nations will also penetrate the hinterland. Therefore, we have prepared a letter to express this to you, hoping that you will promptly convene a general meeting to express your protest and make a strong statement against the establishment of a consulate. This matter concerns the interests of our Sichuanese compatriots and the sovereignty of the nation. Your association should be happy to accept this request. Respectfully addressed to the Sichuanese Fellow-Provincials Association. It is also learned that the Sichuanese Student Association in Shanghai and other organizations have launched the Shanghai Sichuanese Anti-Consulate Establishment Joint Association and sent a letter to various Sichuanese organizations in Shanghai, saying: "Dear Sirs, Recently, it was reported that Japan will establish a consulate-general in Chengdu and appoint Iwai Eiichi, the head of the China Section of the Chinese Intelligence Department of the Embassy, as consul. Iwai is scheduled to take the Luoyang Maru to Chengdu on August 2, which is alarming. Chengdu is not a treaty port, and according to the treaty, consulates may not be established. The various countries in China have been peaceful for a long time, which shows that international law still exists. We are living in an era of national crisis, and our suffering has reached the extreme. How can we remain silent? Moreover, the freedom to establish consulates is not only related to national sovereignty but also closely related to the personal interests of all our Sichuanese compatriots, especially the direct impact on our Sichuanese businessmen. We are concerned about our hometown and should bear the responsibility for its survival. Therefore, we intend to launch the Shanghai Sichuanese Anti-Consulate Establishment Joint Association to jointly seek good policies to save the country. We urgently request that your association promptly send responsible representatives to our office at 5:00 PM on August 2 (Sunday) to discuss everything. (Rest omitted)."</p>
<h3 id="e100">Mr. Gao Mengdan's Treatment at Baolong Hospital: A Report to Relatives and Friends <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Since my late father fell ill, he has been visited by concerned relatives and friends. They are also aware that his condition has been improving day by day, and that he would soon be discharged from the hospital. However, when they heard the news of his death, many were shocked and perplexed. They have been asking about the course of his treatment. I hereby present a detailed account as follows, hoping that you will carefully review it.</p>
<p>My late father fell ill on his return journey from Sichuan to Shanghai. Doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia. He was admitted to Baolong Hospital on June 29th and treated by Dr. Mertens and Dr. Li Mingchen. His pneumonia had been steadily improving, and his temperature and pulse were normal. His appetite was also good, but he often suffered from insomnia at night. On the evening of July 8th, he took two sleeping pills as prescribed by the doctor. From midnight until dawn, he was restless. On the evening of the 9th, he took two pills but still could not sleep. So, Dr. Li Mingchen prescribed two more pills. After taking them, he not only could not fall asleep, but he became even more restless, pacing and staggering. He closed his eyes and opened his mouth, unable to speak. He would sit up less than a minute after lying down and try to get out of bed. He used so much force that even two attendants could not restrain him. This continued until seven or eight o'clock the next morning. When Dr. Mertens and Dr. Li Mingchen came to the ward, they were told about what happened the previous night. Upon hearing that he had taken four sleeping pills, Dr. Mertens exclaimed, "too much, too much!" Afterwards, I privately asked Dr. Mertens about the harm of taking too much medication. He said that because of his age and weak heart, he should not have taken so many sleeping pills. Despite these two setbacks, he was able to recuperate through careful nursing, and his condition improved daily. His appetite also grew stronger. He was able to switch from liquids to finely ground rice, oatmeal, minced eggs, and diced wheat. Dr. Li Mingchen repeatedly told us that he would soon be discharged from the hospital. The family rejoiced, thinking that his condition would turn from danger to safety. Who knew that an unforeseen event would occur? Alas. On the evening of the 19th, my late father could not fall asleep for a long time. At 1:00 AM on the 20th, he felt restless and talked incessantly. At around 3:00 AM, Dr. Li Mingchen was called to examine him and prescribed two Evipan sleeping pills. Because of past experience, Junsan pleaded with Dr. Li not to use this medication and asked if it was possible to take only one pill. Dr. Li insisted that the medication was not as strong as the previous one, and there would be no problem taking it. After speaking, he crushed the pill himself and administered it with water. My father fell asleep immediately and began to snore. However, after less than ten minutes, he began tossing and turning again, sitting up and lying down, very restless. He closed his eyes and opened his mouth, as he had done the previous time, but with even more force. Even three people could not restrain him. At around 5:00 AM, Dr. Li came and injected him with Scopulamin, a sedative, but it was ineffective. Then he injected him with another sedative, Luminal. At the time, no one realized that it was also a sedative. He slept for less than two hours and then began to be restless again. He would get up and lie down, not resting for even a minute. Later, Dr. Mertens ordered an injection of Chloral hydrate, but it was also ineffective. The restlessness did not diminish throughout the day. However, Dr. Li said after each pulse check that his pulse was very good and that he would soon wake up. He also said that he only needed to rest for a few more days and he could be discharged from the hospital. At about 5:00 PM that afternoon, a Western nurse at the hospital examined his chest and exclaimed that he was poisoned by too many sedatives. She immediately called Dr. Mertens, but he claimed to be busy and did not come. That evening, Dr. Sun Dafang (Director of the Zhenru Forensic Institute) and Dr. Zheng Baoshi came to examine him. They were shocked by his condition and said that he was poisoned. They urgently requested Dr. Li to find a way to save him, but Dr. Li was busy with social engagements and did not arrive until much later. When he arrived, he still did not admit that it was caused by taking too many sedatives. The family had no recourse and brought him back from Baolong Hospital on the 21st. They immediately invited famous Shanghai doctors Huang Zhong, Zeng Yaozhong, Lu Jinwen, Zhou Zhenyu, Song Wusheng, Liang Junqing, Zheng Baoshi, Cai Hong, and German doctor Loewenberg to consult. All the doctors unanimously diagnosed him with poisoning from too many sedatives. Moreover, because the poisoning was too deep, treatment was very difficult. From 3:00 AM on the 20th to 0:05 AM on the 23rd, a total of 66 hours, the patient was never at peace for a moment. His suffering was heartbreaking to witness. However, the patient was delirious and did not say a word from beginning to end. When his strength was exhausted, he abandoned Junsan and others and passed away. Alas.</p>
<p>It should be noted that my late father had heart disease two years ago. Although he recovered, his heart was still weak. After entering Baolong Hospital, he was given a heart stimulant injection every three hours, which was stopped after many days. Then he was given oral heart stimulant medication. The hospital doctors were well aware of his weak heart. Why, then, did they repeatedly use large doses of sedatives? According to the doctors, the maximum dose of Evipan for an ordinary person is two tablets. Even an elderly person with a weak heart would only take this dose. In addition to this, he was given a sedative injection. How could this not be fatal? When we left the hospital, Dr. Li gave us a written report of all the medications used at the time. He omitted the Luminal injection that was given the second time. However, the attendants and the doctors who came to the hospital on the 20th had all seen the name of the medication written on the thermometer hanging on the door. The facts are clear. It is evident that the cause of death was the large dose of sedatives given the third time. Junsan and others were by his side and saw Dr. Li Mingchen administer a large dose of sedatives but did not know to stop him. This has caused an eternal regret. Now, I relate the course of treatment at Baolong Hospital, hoping that you will consider it with compassion.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted by Gao Junsan, Junyuan, Jinxuan, Junzhen, Zhongqia, Shuge.</p>

<p>Wydendow</p>
<p>The Polish Minister to China, Wydendow, took his family on the Changxing Company's Canadian Empress steamship and left Shanghai on the morning of the 27th to avoid the heat in Japan. The news that Minister Wydendow was returning to his country on leave was actually a misrepresentation. According to Counselor Utsai of the Polish Embassy, speaking to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, the minister recently contracted an illness and is therefore going to Japan to avoid the heat and recover, and to meet with the Polish Minister to Japan to discuss matters. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai after a six-week vacation. During the Minister's absence, the embassy counselor and Consul-General in Shanghai, Graysinski, will serve as chargé d'affaires as usual. The rumor that the Minister is returning to his country is untrue.</p>
<p>Mirsendeski</p>
<p>The newly appointed Iranian Consul-General in Shanghai, Mirsendeski, has already left Iran by ship to take up his new post in China. He is expected to arrive in Shanghai next month. As for the former Consul-General in Shanghai, Ostovan, he will return to his country on a scheduled date after Mirsendeski arrives in Shanghai and takes over.</p>
<p>Gauss</p>
<p>According to sources from the Shanghai Municipal Council, Davis, the magistrate of the Consular Court of this port, has resigned. It is now known that U.S. Consul General Gauss has been promoted and appointed to take his place. The Consular Court Secretary has notified various bureaus and consuls.</p>
<p>Sackville</p>
<p>Colonel Sackville, the commander of the British Army's Lancashire Regiment stationed in Shanghai, has recently been recalled to his country. It is now known that Sackville is scheduled to depart for his country on the 19th of next month. At 8:00 AM on that day, the troops stationed in various countries and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps of the Public Concession will send honor guards to bid farewell and inspect Sackville. The new commander, Colonel A.P.D. Teller-Smollet, is en route to China and will arrive in Shanghai on the 9th of next month on the P&amp;O's Rhioupoortana to take over.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Xingyuan Steamer Telegram: Encountered a Maritime Accident; Shanghai Sends Telegram to Investigate and Report the Details of the Disaster <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>This office, Yongyuan Firm, received a telegram stating that the firm's Xingyuan steamer, carrying goods and passengers from Tianjin, Yantai, and other places to Yingkou, encountered an unexpected danger when entering Yingkou port. The ship suffered a maritime accident. Although the telegram did not provide detailed information about the nature of the accident, it only mentioned that the anchor was dropped at the time, but the anchor chain broke, and the large iron anchor sank to the bottom of the port. Based on this situation, it is possible that the ship was struck by wind and waves. Fortunately, the ship itself is still safe. After receiving the telegram, Shanghai, not knowing the details of the accident, telegraphed Yingkou, instructing the captain of the Xingyuan steamer to thoroughly investigate how the accident occurred and report the details as soon as possible.

<h3 id="e110">Spring Cocoon Loan Syndicate to Conclude <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai silver and money industry organized a 25th-year spring cocoon collection loan syndicate to handle the collection of cocoon goods in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, totaling more than 10 million yuan. The term is three months, and it has now expired and is being returned one after another. There are still tens of thousands of yuan to be fully paid. The borrowers have contacted the syndicate and scheduled a date to pay off the debt within days. It is reported that the syndicate is scheduled to convene all participating banks and villages in the middle of next week to discuss the conclusion and report on the progress of the handling.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Various Banks Allocate Huge Sums to Handle Rural Lending; Banks Such as Bank of Communications Allocate 10 Million Yuan Each to Comply with the Provisions of the Savings Bank Law <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Since the Savings Bank Law was promulgated and implemented by the government, it stipulates that savings banks must, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 7 and 8, provide mortgage loans to rural cooperatives and loans secured by agricultural products, which shall not be less than one-fifth of the total deposits. Although various banks have organized such organizations as the China Agricultural Loan Silver Round and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Spring Cocoon Collection Loan Syndicate, or established special agricultural departments to handle various agricultural loans and guarantee the joint lending funds of the Agricultural Credit Bureau, the total amount is still often less than one-fifth of the savings bank law. Now, each bank has decided to invest one-fifth of the savings deposits in rural areas in order to comply with the Savings Bank Law. For example, Bank of Communications has savings deposits of more than 55,522,900 yuan and has decided to allocate more than 10 million yuan. Shanghai Bank has savings deposits of more than 36,574,000 yuan and has decided to allocate more than 7 million yuan. Jin Cheng Bank has savings deposits of more than 51,879,000 yuan and has decided to allocate more than 10 million yuan. Therefore, there is great hope for the revival of agriculture in our country.</p>

<p>Yuan An, Shun An, and Tongshang Ships Dismantled</p>
<p>Civil Aviation Industry Cooperates to Seek Development</p>
<p>Dazhen Shipping Company, located at No. 12, Bund, Shanghai, recently experienced sluggish business and internal problems. It suddenly sold the Yongping ship to Australian merchants. Other companies, such as Yuan An Company, dismantled old ships to reduce their burden. China's private shipping industry is facing competition from foreign businesses and is currently seeking ways to recover. The situation is as follows:</p>

<p>Yongping and Yong'an, two ships of the Dazhen Shipping Company that operated on the Shanghai-Hai routes and specialized in carrying passengers and cargo, were affected by shipping competition and sluggish business over the years, resulting in considerable losses. The Yongping ship, with a gross tonnage of 1,421 tons and a net tonnage of 984 tons, has been sold to an Australian shipping company. The transaction has been completed. It is rumored that there are also some problems within the company's internal organization, but the exact situation is still under investigation.</p>

<p>A reporter from Dagong News Agency learned from shipping authorities in this city that the Yuan'an ship of Yuan'an Company, with a gross tonnage of 1,794.95 tons and a net tonnage of 1,114 tons; the Shun'an ship of Shun'an Company, with a gross tonnage of 1,455.14 tons and a net tonnage of 1,071 tons; and the Tongshang ship of Tongshang Company, with an unspecified tonnage, were all dismantled at shipyards to avoid losses due to sluggish traffic on various routes.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Private Shipping Industry Seeks to Recover <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Due to the laissez-faire policy of commercial treaties, foreign businesses have entered China unhindered, relying on their strong financial resources to seize the ocean shipping industry. China's state-owned and private shipping companies are under serious threat and are barely surviving. Since the Ministry of Communications convened the Civil Aviation Reorganization Conference, each company has sought to regenerate itself. Regardless of ocean, coastal, or Yangtze River routes, the cooperative system has been adopted to avoid competition within the industry. However, due to the decline of commerce, the shipping industry has not improved in terms of cargo transportation. The operating figures of various shipping companies are similar to those of the first half of the year, so it is not easy to recover from chronic illness in a short period of time.

<p>Unfinished Business Transferred to the Relief Committee</p>
<p>Bank Advances Reimbursed by the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Last summer, Hubei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, and Hebei provinces suffered floods due to the Yellow River and Yangtze River overflowing. On August 8 of that year, the Shanghai Fundraising Relief Association for Flood Victims in Various Provinces was established to assist the government in handling relief matters. Nearly a year has passed since then. Emergency relief, agricultural relief, and other relief efforts in the disaster areas of various provinces have all been allocated and verified. The work relief project is still being carried out by the Relief Committee in collaboration with the National Economic Council and various water conservancy agencies. Now, Kong Xiangxi, the president of the Flood Relief Association, and Zhu Qinglan, the vice president, believe that the association's various relief works have been completed one after another, and the disaster areas have recovered, so the mission is declared complete. It was decided to close at the end of this month. The board of directors is currently supervising the internal affairs to speed up the closing. From the date of establishment to the present, all receipts and expenditures have been calculated and registered by the finance group, and other matters have been compiled into work reports by the general affairs, fundraising, relief, verification, and design groups, respectively, to prepare a comprehensive report and closing process to be submitted to the central relief agency for record. Unfinished business will be transferred to the Shanghai Office of the Relief Committee, and all files and documents will also be transferred to the Relief Committee for receipt. Internal staff at all levels will be transferred back to their original relief and charitable agencies. As for the 500,000 yuan of emergency relief advances that the association borrowed from the banking community in this city, 470,000 yuan have been repaid successively according to the contract, and the remaining 30,000 yuan are temporarily offset by work relief public bonds and have not yet been cleared. Now, this remaining debt has been transferred by the association to Chairman Zhu of the Relief Committee for submission to the 272nd regular meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 28th, and it has been approved that the entire amount will be reimbursed by the Ministry of Finance to the lending banks. Zhu will report everything to the Executive Yuan in Beijing after the association closes. Furthermore, various disaster-stricken provinces along the Yangtze River are now starting flood prevention work.</p>

<p>The Silk Improvement Committee of the National Economic Council, having assessed the overseas sales of Chinese silk, determined that its position in the European and American markets had declined sharply in recent years due to the impact of the global economic downturn, and it was not until the second half of last year that it began to recover slightly. In the spring of this year, due to the sharp decline in Japanese silk production, China's international silk trade increased by a factor of two compared to previous years. Knowing that the association intends to organize a joint silk reeling factory in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to control production and improve silk quality in order to prevent exporters from manipulating the market and to promote sales, it recently decided at a regular meeting to send personnel to Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, and other places to consult with the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial construction departments on cooperative methods and to inspect the internal equipment of silk factories in various silk-producing areas. The negotiations have been completed and a report is being drafted to prepare for implementation. Regarding the total cost of ordering silk reeling machinery, it is planned to negotiate loans with the Agricultural Bank of China and other banks, using the purchased machinery as collateral. Negotiations are underway and are generally expected to be successful. In the future, the site of the joint silk reeling factory will be located in Shanghai for the sake of transportation convenience.</p>

<p>Court Revokes Bankruptcy</p>
<p>The China Xingye Bank declared its closure on October 11, 1934, due to financial difficulties.

<p>Since the implementation of land registration in Shanghai County in May of last year, it has been actively carried out. However, a small number of property owners have not yet registered, so the deadline has been extended to August 15 to show consideration. The bureau yesterday sent a letter to various districts, instructing the heads of villages and towns to work hard to promote and urge registration. If there are further delays, the land will be sealed and investigated on a household basis. Furthermore, land ownership certificates have been issued in Beiqiao, the county seat, since the 15th of this month, for a period of one month. Various other villages and towns will also be issued on a scheduled basis. As for the land value tax, it has been decided to start this year. The urban and rural land value areas have also been divided. Rural land accounts for more than 254,102 mu, with an average land value of more than one hundred yuan per mu. Calculated at a 1% land value tax, each mu should be taxed one yuan, which is seven cents less than the original land tax of one yuan and eight cents per mu. The conversion of old mu to new mu is nine fen and two li per mu, which invisibly adds eight fen and five li to the current tax amount, for a total reduction of one jiao and five fen. Furthermore, urban land accounts for more than 6,300 mu. The land value of this item must be approved by the province. The county's field tax and county tax are collected in two installments of 40% and 60% each year. The budgeted amount for the 25th year is 110,234 yuan.

<h3 id="e147">Temporary Measures by the Municipal Council to Remedy the Shortage of Rickshaw Pullers <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that during the planting season, many rickshaw pullers in this port have returned to their hometowns to engage in farming, resulting in many idle rickshaws. Rickshaw owners are suffering considerable losses. The Municipal Council's rickshaw department has recently devised a method to remedy this situation, which is now being implemented. That is, rickshaw pullers who wish to return to their hometowns to farm can report to the licensing office and surrender their registration certificate. During their absence from Shanghai, the rickshaw owner can assign another person to pull their rickshaw. When the original rickshaw puller returns to Shanghai from his hometown, the registration certificate will be returned, and the name of the substitute rickshaw puller will be removed from the register. The rickshaw department's implementation of this new method is in response to a request from the rickshaw owners' association. Recently, a large number of unregistered rickshaw pullers have been arrested by the police for violating regulations. Therefore, the rickshaw owners' association petitioned the Municipal Council, stating that during this planting season, the number of rickshaw pullers returning to their hometowns to farm is indeed large. In order to maintain business, rickshaw owners have no choice but to use unregistered persons to pull their rickshaws and requested the Municipal Council to consider the difficulties of business and make appropriate accommodations. Therefore, the rickshaw department has this new method. According to a certain official of the rickshaw department yesterday, the Municipal Council's intention in issuing this is not to greatly increase the total number of rickshaw pullers in the Public Concession, but to facilitate rickshaw pullers returning to their hometowns for work and to prevent rickshaw owners from suffering losses due to a temporary lack of labor.</p>
<p>The Ta Mei Evening News reports that although the Municipal Council's rickshaw department has implemented a new method of substitute rickshaw pulling, 44 rickshaws were still arrested and sent to the First Special District Court on Wednesday morning for pulling rickshaws without registration certificates. Those arrested on Tuesday were mostly ordered to pay a fine of one yuan for release, and those without funds had their rickshaws held as collateral.</p>
<h3 id="e148">The Winner of the First Prize in the 24th Aviation Ticket <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The 24th Aviation Highway Construction Lottery was drawn on July 3rd at Yiyuan. The first prize number is 006416, sold by the Datong Company branch at 170 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession of Shanghai. We have learned a few details about the winner for the enjoyment of others. It is said that Mr. Fei Shicheng of the Nanshi area of this port has been doing business in Zhongjiang for many years and has saved some money. He has an elderly mother, a wife, and two sons, and the family is very happy. On June 23rd, which was the abolished lunar Dragon Boat Festival, when the wine banquet was in full swing, Mr. Fei initiated the purchase of aviation lottery tickets to add to the fun. After discussion, the grandmother and two grandsons jointly invested in two tickets with the number 006416. Mr. Fei bought two tickets with the number 006417 on his own, and his wife bought two tickets with the number 006415 on her own. After the drawing, all five people won prizes, hitting the mark without fail. This is truly a coincidence. Mr. Zhang, a clerk from a porcelain shop in Jiujiang, came to Shanghai to negotiate business. One day, he happened to pass Avenue Edward VII and bought five first prize tickets from the company. Also, a Mr. Chen from Haige Road in Mubao bought three first prize tickets. Yu Yongxing on Avenue Joffre sold the second prize number 091241, which was reportedly bought in full by the eldest son of a certain mansion on Rue Albert. The Huiliyuan North branch on Nanjing Road sold the second prize number 199357, which was found to have seven tickets sent by mail to Bian Liangchen of Baziqiao in Xinghua City. Mr. Shen of Qiujiang Wharf in this port won two tickets. Several female workers from a certain yarn factory in Chedaijiao jointly purchased one ticket. The above-mentioned wealthy individuals have all received their prizes from the designated banks in recent days.</p>

Municipal Council lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the case, stating that according to the boy's statement at the police station, he was fooled by someone named A Tu, and his mother was waiting in court. He requested a decision. Zhang Xiaoyin then testified about what happened. Detective Chen presented the counterfeit banknote and red pills for inspection. When questioned, Wang confessed that A Tu, who lived on Xikang Road, had given him the five-yuan Bank of Communications note and told him to go to the cigarette and paper shop to buy things. He was told that he could keep half of the change and would be treated to refreshments. He also asked him to carry the red pills, and he did not know he was committing a crime. His mother, Wang Wu, stated that Yongfu was her son, attending school, and had never broken the law. He was exploited by A Tu and requested that the court understand. Judge Zhong Qing lectured the boy and ordered him to be handed over to his mother to take back and discipline. The evidence was confiscated.</p>

<p>There are more than 300 prisoners detained in the Special Court No. 2 Detention Center on Rue Massenet in the French Concession. On the morning of the 7th of this month, a disturbance occurred because the prisoners demanded improved treatment. As a result, the French police were notified and sent detectives to stop it. More than ten prisoners were taken for questioning and sent back to the detention center the next day. Unexpectedly, two prisoners, Wu Sannan, prisoner No. 503, and Tang Jinsheng, prisoner No. 518, were injured again due to a dispute, with blood flowing from their heads. They reported to the Special Court No. 2 Prosecutor's Office that they had been beaten by the guards and requested an examination. Subsequently, Prosecutor Wang Ren opened a court to investigate and concluded that the two prisoners, Wu and Tang, had obstructed public duty and made false accusations. He then filed a public prosecution with the criminal court of the same court in accordance with the law. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Criminal Court President Wang Gangxu presided over the hearing in Criminal Court No. 2. Prosecutor Wang Ren appeared in court to state the grounds for the prosecution and requested that the case be handled in accordance with the law. Subsequently, Teng Guoxun, the director of the guards, testified that on the morning of the 8th of this month, the two prisoners, Wu and Tang, requested to change rooms. Because of my duties, I could not readily agree, and a dispute arose. The two defendants picked up slippers and a copper water dipper and beat me on the head. Liu Yan and Dai Rude, two guards, were blocking them, as testified by my colleagues Liu and Dai. The court ordered Liu and Dai to be questioned, and their testimony was consistent with Teng's. When questioned, the two prisoners, Wu and Tang, said that we were locked in the toilet room, which was small and unbearably hot and smelly. We had no choice but to request a change of room. Director Teng not only refused but also tied us with ropes and beat our heads with leather belts, causing us to bleed, and then pushed us into the room. How dare we prisoners beat the guards? There are layers of darkness in the detention center. Please investigate the court. If it is not improved and we are forced to live an inhuman life, please just execute us so we can be happy. Prisoner Tang also submitted a written statement accusing the detention center of darkness. The court verified the testimonies, ordered the debate to be opened, and then declared the conclusion, setting the date for the verdict on August 1. The two defendants were returned to the detention center. One bandit was captured on the spot.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Woman Divorces and Remarries, Again Meets the Wrong Person, Sweet Words Induce Her During Social Gatherings, Abandoned Not Long After Cohabitation - Gu Xuelin Accuses Hua Dafan - <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Gu Xuelin, a 33-year-old woman from Suzhou, residing at No. 17 Houyuli, Old Garbage Bridge, recently hired lawyer Gu Yongquan and filed a complaint with the First Special Court against Hua Dafan (aka David), the director of the Yuchengfeng Candy Factory residing at Yongjili, North Zhejiang Road, for fraud, seduction, abandonment, and other charges. The reasons for her lawsuit are roughly as follows: The plaintiff was originally married to a Mr. Chen, residing in Suzhou, and had two sons and three daughters. The couple's relationship was quite harmonious. However, in August of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, she met the defendant through an introduction at a social gathering. He seduced her with sweet words, saying that his household was empty and there was no one to support him, and that he wanted to marry her. If she did not agree, he would rather die. She fell for his trick. Unexpectedly, her husband learned about it and reported it to the Public Security Bureau, who arrested him and sent him to the Shanghai District Court. Subsequently, both parties agreed to divorce, and the case was withdrawn. Before the plaintiff had a physical relationship with the defendant, the defendant personally wrote a note stating that if the plaintiff suffered any family changes due to the defendant, the defendant would be fully responsible and would marry her with the proper ceremony. The plaintiff then began cohabiting with the defendant in the 24th year of the Republic of China. On January 18 of last year, a formal cohabitation contract was re-established at lawyer Zhang Shijie's office. The content was roughly as follows: "Both parties will love each other to the end and will not change their minds halfway. The wedding will be held within one year. All of the plaintiff's expenses before the wedding will be borne by the defendant. At the time of the wedding, the defendant will pay a savings account of 4,000 yuan and 1,000 yuan in cash. If the contract is not fulfilled within the time limit, the defendant must compensate the plaintiff for a loss of 50,000 yuan. If one party regrets it, the other party may claim damages." Unexpectedly, after the plaintiff divorced her original husband, the defendant, having achieved his goal, disregarded his previous promises and moved the plaintiff east and west. Recently, because she repeatedly urged him to hold the wedding, the defendant became angry and abandoned her. This is clearly a crime under Articles 229 and 294 of the Criminal Code. A civil lawsuit is also attached, requesting that the defendant be ordered to pay 50,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the hearing in Criminal Court No. 8. The defendant did not arrive, but lawyer Wang Shouan arrived in court, stating that the defendant was currently in Suzhou and requesting a postponement. He briefly questioned the plaintiff, Gu Xuelin. The court ordered that the case be postponed and reheard at 11:00 AM on August 5.</p>

<p>Xu Abao, a young man from Ningbo, 20 years old, worked as a low-level assistant for the Taikoo Shipping Company's Wenzhou steamer. He was a person who worried about the times and resented the world. On the afternoon of the 27th of this month, at 3 o'clock, the ship was loaded with coal to Shanghai and stopped at the Wusong Railway Wharf. Xu stood on the deck, leisurely gazing. At that time, a Japanese merchant ship, the Shanghai Maru, was entering the port. Everyone on the ship looked energetic and lively. Xu saw this energetic appearance and was filled with complaints again. He spoke in an impassioned tone, saying to his colleagues, "Look at how rich in innovation other countries are, making them powerful nations. As for our country, if there is no money at home, one immediately thinks about multiple wives." However, a chief steward, Tong Aqing, happened to be in a family situation with multiple women. He felt that this was intentionally sarcastic and subtle criticism. He slapped Xu Abao's face. Xu Abao was of a low status and was beaten and humiliated by Tong. He cried loudly. In the midst of his weeping, Xu Abao suddenly fell into the river, joining the water spirits, with no trace to be found. Tong Aqing took this opportunity to leave the ship and go ashore, with his whereabouts unknown, fleeing without a trace. Zhu Jifang, a foreign kitchen assistant of the ship, Dai Ayun, a second steward, Fan Hantang, a chief mate's assistant, Feng Chuanshan, a watchman, and Lu Gengen, a coppersmith, who were present at the scene, reported to the guards, who reported it to the water patrol police station. The arrest of Tong Aqing was unsuccessful. Investigators such as Xu Juelu were instructed to retrieve the body with the Wusong Lifesaving Bureau. It was recovered yesterday and taken to the Wusong beach. After Investigator Xu reported it to the local court, Xiao, the assigned prosecutor, and Yi, the examiner, etc., arrived at the scene for examination and confirmed that it was a drowning death. However, whether the deceased was pushed into the water or threw himself in due to humiliation and anger, the police department's investigation of witnesses was evasive. Therefore, the prosecutor ordered the body to be collected, waiting to summon witnesses for a detailed investigation of the facts, and ordered the arrest of the fugitive Tong Aqing to be brought to justice.</p>

It is currently under construction day and night, and construction can begin in three weeks. In addition, a magnificent swimming pool has been built, with exquisite structure, large area, and luxurious appearance. The completeness of the equipment and the beauty of the outline can be said to be unprecedented. Now that the hot summer is here, the best way to enjoy yourself is to swim. It is said that the company has scheduled to open part of the swimming pool on the afternoon of the 31st of this month at 4 o'clock. The location of the garden is central and the transportation is convenient. It is expected that there will be a grand scene on Metcalfe Road that day with heavy traffic.</p>

<p>To the Editor-in-Chief of Shen Bao, Respectfully, Regarding the matter of Mr. Liu Chunshan raising money on behalf of the parents of Mr. Pan Hongsheng on the Huaxing Radio Station last year, I handled it at that time and sent it to the Huaxing Radio Station for collection and transferred a fixed deposit and withdrawal savings passbook from the Hua An Bank to the Pan residence. The principal and interest of ten yuan in legal tender were withdrawn every six months, with a limit of ten years. Now, because the Hua An Bank is closing down all savings accounts and returning them to depositors, in addition to paying off the principal and interest of other depositors, it was found that the savings account for the parents' pension of Mr. Pan Hongsheng has not been withdrawn. Now, because the address of Mr. Pan is unknown, I hereby request that you publish a letter in your newspaper, asking the relatives and comrades of Mr. Pan to notify the parents of Mr. Pan to take the certificate and withdraw the money from the Hua An Bank and deposit it in another bank. This would be a great merit. Please publish it. Sincerely, Hu Gesheng, July 29, 1936.</p>
<p>Respectfully, I read the news column in your newspaper on the 28th of this month, which stated, "Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association Supports the Chen Case," and mentioned, "A temporary meeting was held at the West District Branch." I was very surprised after reading it. The association, apart from directly negotiating once on the day after the incident in the Chen Huizhang case, did not participate in any groups. As for the temporary meeting held at the West District Branch on the 27th of this month, no one borrowed the meeting place from the association beforehand. I believe there was no meeting held. I am afraid that people from all walks of life will not understand the truth and will cause misunderstandings. Therefore, I am especially writing to request your newspaper to make a correction. This is what I implore. To the Editor-in-Chief of Shen Bao, Sincerely, Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association, July 29th.</p>

<h3 id="e169">The Egg Industry in Shanghai (Continued) <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Chief Editor of China Credit</p>
<p>(Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Overview 33)</p>
<p>Traditional Egg Factories All are organized by Chinese merchants. One factory is established in Shanghai for manufacturing, and the rest are established in Jiangsu Province and other places in northern Jiangsu Province. The manufacturing methods are more advanced and can pay attention to improving quality. Some use hot air to dry. Among them, Flying Yellow Egg Products are manufactured by machines. Fuxing and Xinchang both have new-style machine equipment, so they are called new-style factories. The scope of each factory is quite large, with two to three hundred workers, and the capital is over 100,000 yuan. The list of traditional egg factories is as follows:</p>
<p>Export Companies There are no less than forty export egg companies in the city. In addition to Chinese merchants, British, German, French, Italian, American, Japanese, and Dutch merchants are all present. Most of them are transported to Europe and the United States, and a small number are transported to the South Seas Islands. This year, the German firm Lihé and the American firm Meizui have the most frequent sales. The list of export firms is as follows:</p>
<p>(Note: Maochang and six other companies are included in the ice egg factory category):</p>
<p>(1) Chinese Merchants Yingfeng, Huaxin, Jinhai, Futianshen, Yihua, Yuxingxiang, Judetai, Yian, Zhang Hongtai, Guangmaoxiang, Guangyuansheng, Guangyichang, Chengxin, Yuanshunxiang, Dongxingyuan.</p>
<p>(2) British Merchants Morse, Xinji, Anli, Fumo, Old Sassoon, Baoshun.</p>
<p>(3) German Merchants Meizui, Jiali, Chanshen, Lihé, Fulaide, Yali, Yitai.</p>
<p>(4) French Merchants Baiduo, Lixing, Xingcheng, Youyu.</p>
<p>(5) Italian Merchants Yixing, Xingli</p>
<p>(6) American Merchants Maosheng</p>
<p>(7) Japanese Merchants Kawauchi Kai, Zēngxìng, Kobayashi.</p>
<p>Egg Shops The business of egg shops is mainly based on selling retail and selling to small merchants. Fresh eggs, salted eggs, and preserved eggs are all sold. Most of them are operated in partnership, with capital ranging from several thousand yuan to 50,000 yuan. In the past, the egg industry in Shanghai was an ancillary business of salted fish shops. Gradually, the business became more prosperous and could be operated independently, and there were so-called egg shops. In recent years, the market has declined, and egg shops have closed down one after another due to poor business. There are Yida, Jiexing, Zheng Hengji, Tianzhu, Taishenxiang, Renchang, etc. The list of egg shops is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Chinese Concession District Wanfeng, Jieshun, Fengmao, Liji, Yuchang, Chen Qingji, Zhentai, Lin, Xinchang, Tongxing, Tongmaosheng, Tongxinggong, Changtai, Xinji, Wang Xinji, Wang Songji, Hetai, Heda, Xintai, Yongfengde, Qiaxingde.</p>

<h3 id="e172">The Torch Passed Through the Hungarian Capital and Arrived in Austria, Vienna Prepares to Welcome It <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>National Maritime News Agency, Saigrad, 28th dispatch, The World Games torch passed through the border between Yugoslavia and Hungary at 6:00 this morning. A special ceremony was held in the town of Hargos near the border. The town had specially built an Olympic arcade, decorated with flower flags, which was very beautiful. Even at this early hour, there were 1,500 Hungarian cycling teams gathered to watch the ceremony.</p>
<p>After the representative of Yugoslavia delivered a brief congratulatory speech, the national flags of all countries were hoisted. The mayor of Saigrad represented Hungary in accepting the torch. The second torch journey was the capital of Hungary. 203 race walkers covered a distance of 160 kilometers.</p>
<p>National Maritime News Agency, Budapest, 28th dispatch, The World Games torch arrived in the suburbs of this city at 8:00 this evening. The race walkers were welcomed by the public, especially the crowds gathered at the Triumphal Arch. The Triumphal Arch is located in the center of the city and was specially built with a World Games torch altar and a viewing platform for officials and dignitaries. The Triumphal Arch was covered with lights. The reflection of these beautiful lights on the nearby lake was like the stars in the sky. The person who carried the torch to the Triumphal Arch in the Hungarian capital was Barsi, the Hungarian 400-meter star. Mr. Barsi hastily gave the torch to the mayor of the Hungarian capital. During the celebration, in addition to the Hungarian national anthem and the World Games song, Hungarian folk songs from all over the country were sung by the public.</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent of the Central News Agency, Feng Youzhen</p>
<p>There are said to be more than 300 overseas Chinese in Colombo, but there is no organization. The most famous is Lin Baiquan. When our car passed his door, we saw a wooden sign with his name written on the wall. The driver told us that he was very famous locally. He has fourteen daughters and one son. But according to another driver, he has fourteen daughters and ten sons. He is a merchant who deals in safflower oil (a medicinal product similar to Mentholatum). He manufactures it locally and sells it in India, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan, and has accumulated some assets. He has lived in Colombo for more than 30 years and is now in his fifties. He is very kind and hospitable. Ma Dehan, Yu Hengzhi, Chen Deyi, Xu Minde, Liu Quanda, and others visited him. He knew that the food on the ship did not suit the Chinese palate, so he specially prepared a table of vegetables and invited them to have a full meal. According to him, only a dozen or so of the more than 300 overseas Chinese in Colombo are Cantonese (he himself is also Cantonese). The rest are mostly from Shandong. They used to come to sell silk. In recent years, they have been forced to wander in foreign lands and have had no choice but to switch to selling Japanese goods. When our car passed on the street, we also saw several Shandong merchants with packages on their backs, their clothes dirty and unbearable, and their appearance very embarrassed. It is conceivable that their lives are generally difficult. As for the shops of overseas Chinese, we only saw one named "China Commercial Company". The glass window displayed many embroidered goods, which were very clean and tidy. Because of the limited time, we did not go in to visit.</p>
<p>The climate in Colombo is similar to that in Singapore and is not very hot. The evening breeze is quite cool. We finished our tour and returned to the ship at 6:30 PM. It was already lit up with thousands of lights. At about 8:00 PM, we set sail again and continued to advance in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>(2) The Waves Became More Dangerous</p>
<p>The six hours of rest in Colombo gave everyone a chance to relax after the fatigue of sea travel, and they felt refreshed physically and mentally. However, after the mail ship left the port, it sailed again in the Indian Ocean. During these two days, there were often strong winds, and the waves lurking under the water were even more terrifying than the turbulent waves on the surface of the sea. The ship was constantly swaying up, down, left, and right, and more people became seasick.</p>
<p>The most painful thing for everyone was the unfamiliarity with the diet. On the one hand, it was due to seasickness, and on the other hand, the Western food really did not suit the Chinese taste. For these ten days, every meal was quenched with cold water and filled with bread, fish, and meat. Everyone had a great loss of appetite and regarded the dining room as a place to be feared.</p>
<p>Dozens of compatriots living in steerage ate Chinese food every meal. The ship hired a Ningbo cook to cook for them. When the players learned of this news, they were overjoyed and scrambled to ask him to cook Chinese food. As a result, the Ningbo cook did a great business. A bowl of fried rice with eggs was sold for 50 cents, and a meal of one meat, one vegetable, and one soup was sold for one yuan. Although it was a bit expensive, many people were still eager to relieve their hunger and there was an endless stream of people. This cook probably never dreamed that he could earn this extra money this time.</p>
<p>It has been two weeks since we left Shanghai, and everyone's hair has gradually grown. Some people tried it at the barber shop. Haircuts cost two shillings and sixpence (equivalent to two yuan and one corner in national currency), and shaving costs an additional two shillings. The barber no longer had any hope for the players.</p>
<p>It is 893 nautical miles from Colombo to Mumbai, and the ship needs to travel for more than 50 hours. It is expected to arrive at 6:00 tomorrow morning. The football team that is heading to Nanyang, India, will gather in Mumbai and go to Germany. The mail ship will have a 5-hour stop, and everyone can go ashore to relax again. However, there will be a 5-day journey from Mumbai to Marseille, and it will not be like now, sailing not far from the coast. Perhaps the waves at that time will be even more dangerous. Everyone is worried like this. (Sent from Mumbai on July 9)</p>

<p>(4) On the way from Colombo to Mumbai ——Our reporter Qian Yiqin——</p>
<p>After the ship arrived in Colombo at 1:00 PM on July 6th, the members organized themselves into teams to travel, usually in groups of five or six people, taking cars to view the scenery of Ceylon. The place has museums, zoos, temples, parks, etc. Although they are not very grand, they are all of a certain scale. At about 6:00 PM, the groups returned to the ship one after another, and the ship set sail straight for Mumbai that night at 8:00 PM.</p>
<p>After departing from Colombo, the wind and waves rose again. Many of the members suffered from seasickness and loss of appetite during these days, accounting for more than one-third, so various activities were invisibly suspended. However, the chess competition continued. In the finals, Wu Demao and Qian Yiqin fought five fierce battles, and the victory and defeat were not decided. Wu won the first game, the second game was a draw, Wu won the third game, the fourth game was a draw, and the fifth game was also a draw. Therefore, after the Arts and Entertainment Committee decided, the championship was divided equally, which was also an interesting event in the journey.</p>
<p>Because the food on the ship has been tasteless for a long time, some members have changed to Chinese dishes, but they need to pay extra, one national currency per meal, which is also considered expensive. The Western menu is roughly as follows, but it varies slightly every day:</p>
<p>(Lunch) Snacks—a small cup of light soup—macaroni—roast pork—fruit—coffee.</p>
<p>(Dinner) Vegetarian soup—beef—fish—ice cream—fruit—coffee.</p>
<p>Since the Arts and Entertainment Committee has ended the chess business, it has now launched a Go championship competition. Those who have signed up to participate include Li Zhou, Feng Youzhen, Hao Gengsheng, Wang Shoufang, etc. There will undoubtedly be fierce battles.</p>
<p>It is permissible to arrive in Mumbai at 6:00 AM on July 9th. Since departing from Shanghai, it has sailed 4,772 li, a total of fourteen days. It has now reached one-half of the entire journey. Our football players are all waiting in Mumbai. When the Float Terrace Wheel arrives, they will go to Germany together.</p>

<p>The municipal sports field hosted the municipal colleagues' tennis doubles tournament. Only three teams participated, using a single round-robin system. Yesterday was the final match. Huang Hua and Liu Huisheng played against Xiao Qingyun and Wu Yuhua. Huang Hua is a veteran player. His forehand and backhand long shots are extremely accurate. Coupled with Liu Huisheng's net play and intercepts, it was icing on the cake. Xiao and Wu were indeed inferior. Except for twice taking the lead in the third set, the rest was under Huang and Liu's control. In the end, they lost three to zero. Huang and Liu only lost one set when they played against Sun Yongyi and Shen Zuhui the day before. They won the championship with five points. Sun and Shen scored three points, ranking second. Xiao and Wu only got one point, ranking last. In the singles match, Wang Huabin played against Nong Junfu.

<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Guangdong swimming team arrived in Qingdao on the 23rd. They were received by Yang Jixue and others from the Qingdao Municipal Government and stayed at Mr. He's villa at No. 5 Fushan Branch Road. After a night's rest, they visited the city's aquarium on the next day (24th) and practiced at Huiquan Bathing Beach in the afternoon. On the morning of the 25th, they visited Sifang Park and Zhongshan Park and practiced in the afternoon. At 2:30 PM on the 26th, they competed against the entire Qingdao Chinese team. The location was Huiquan Bathing Beach. Because there were no competition facilities, a floating platform was temporarily set up in front of the beach as the starting point. Two small boats were placed 50 meters away, with a thin line between them as the finish line. However, when the competition was held, there were strong winds and heavy fog, so the various events over 50 meters could not be as smooth as in a swimming pool, so the results were not good. Only four events were contested in this competition. Qingdao only won one second place in the 400-meter freestyle. The rest were all won by the Guangdong team. The female team members did not go into the water. Thousands of people attended the event. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>50-meter Freestyle: (1) Xu Heng (Guangdong), (2) He Yuedian (Guangdong), 31.8 seconds.</p>
<p>100-meter Freestyle: (1) Wang Zhongcheng (Guangdong), (2) Huang Yuanli (Guangdong), 1 minute 31 seconds.</p>

<p>Recently, the six major companies in this city, American International Assurance Company, American Asiatic Underwriters, Franco-American Assurance Company, China Underwriters, China America Printing Company, and American International Banking Corporation, held a joint sports meet at the Shen Garden on Yanping Road. The weather was very good that day, with a cool breeze. Therefore, before the meeting even started, the grandstand was already full of guests. The meeting started at 3:00 PM. More than a hundred athletes, led by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout band, paraded around the field once, solemnly and grandly, with excellent spirit. After the chairman gave a speech, all the athletes took a group photo and then the sports began. There were more than twenty events. Although there was not enough time to practice beforehand, the results were still considerable.

<h3 id="e186">Ministry of Education to Establish Training Classes for Teachers of Free Education and Social Education <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th) This year, the Ministry of Education, for the training of teachers for free education, social education, and vocational education, in addition to vocational education, has already held summer training sessions in Nanjing and Shanghai. After detailed planning, it has been decided to hold a national training class for cadres of free education in Nanjing. Each province and city will recommend three to five people to come to Nanjing for training. The qualifications are limited to graduates of junior colleges and above. After the training is completed, they will return to their original provinces and cities to assume positions in the free education teacher training classes organized by the educational administrative organs of the respective provinces and cities. It is reported that this class recruits graduates of secondary schools who have not yet found employment to receive training. After the training is completed, they will be assigned to various places to be responsible for promoting free education. The detailed implementation measures have been drafted by the Ministry of Education. After Minister Wang approves them and submits them to the Executive Yuan for approval and record, they will be officially announced. It is also reported that the training class is scheduled to start classes in September of this year. In addition, in the training of social education teachers, regarding film education, the Ministry has also decided to hold a training class for electro-optical education personnel.

<h3 id="e187">Tai Shuangqiu Talks About Protecting Teachers <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently revised the regulations for elementary schools, adding articles on protecting teachers. The reporter, taking the protection of teachers' status as one of the three major goals of Teachers' Day, specially visited Mr. Tai Shuangqiu, the initiator of the program and the current Dean of the School of Education of Daxia University, to inquire about his opinions on protecting teachers. According to him, the current revision of the elementary school regulations by the Ministry of Education stipulates that teachers and staff shall not be dismissed due to changes in principals or competent educational administrative personnel. Teachers who are dismissed may state their reasons and submit them to the central educational organ for investigation and correction. This revision is of great significance. I also proposed a case for the protection of educators at the First National Education Conference in the 17th year of the Republic. Although it was passed, it has not been implemented. Today, the Ministry of Education has resolutely made this reform, which can be said to have opened a new era in the history of the Chinese teacher movement. All teachers should be celebrating. However, we should have further opinions and are willing to make suggestions to the Ministry of Education on behalf of the national education community, that is, regarding the dismissal of teachers, the authorities always have reasons. Except in special circumstances, they say it is either immoral or has no achievements. As for the so-called immorality or no achievements, it is only based on the subjective views of the authorities, and there are no objective standards or recognized norms that can be used as evidence. In this sense, protection is difficult to carry out as intended. In my humble opinion, after the laws and regulations protecting teachers are stipulated, the Ministry of Education should immediately convene education experts and practical workers in the education field to jointly discuss and determine the Ethical Codes for Teachers, so as to serve as a guideline for teachers to conduct themselves. Furthermore, various objective and precise teaching scales should be developed to serve as a basis for measuring teaching efficiency. After these two standards are determined, the status of teachers will not be decided by the personal interests of the authorities. When a dismissed teacher states the reasons to the competent educational authority and requests correction, the competent authority will also have a standard for judging right and wrong. I believe that the officials of the Ministry of Education have already considered this and hope that it will be realized as soon as possible. In addition, this kind of protection law should be extended to all educators. I sincerely hope that this item will also be added when the regulations for universities, middle schools, normal schools, and mass schools are revised in the future.</p>

<p>Jiangwan Lida Academy has complete facilities and strict training, and is a well-known secondary school in Shanghai. Eight years ago, it advocated labor production education, added a rural education department to the high school department, exempted tuition and accommodation fees, recruited children from farm families, and provided them with special training, aiming to train talents who specialize in rural careers to improve the countryside. The results are remarkable. The Ministry of Education highly praised it and gave it huge regular subsidies every year. It is reported that the school is planning to improve the rural education department. The department was originally located in Chaitang, a rural area six miles southwest of Nanxiang Station on the Jinghu Road. Now there is a Shanghai-Suzhou highway passing through it. Starting from the next academic year, first- and second-year students will be moved to the Jiangwan headquarters, and third-year students will remain in the original location. First- and second-year students will receive basic training, agricultural training, and military training. Third-year students will receive normal school training and rural service training. The Jiangwan headquarters has a large-scale planting field and livestock farm. Chaitang has a rural elementary school with many students, a farmer's clinic, and other facilities to assist the countryside. Graduates of this department can undertake all rural education work and are well-suited for the education, health, and sanitation work and the work of the Farm Bureau newly established by the Ministry of Industry. They are really useful in the national economic construction movement that is just beginning. As for the junior high school and the general department of the high school, they implement general education, which is no different from general middle schools, but the management is very serious. For example, in the graduation examination of this year, 19 third-year students in the general department of the high school participated, and only one student failed in physics and chemistry. Twenty-four third-year students in the junior high school participated, and only one student also failed in arithmetic. However, the scores of each subject in the examination and the school's usual scores must be combined at a ratio of six to four before graduation can be determined. As a result of the calculation, four high school students and five junior high school students each had one or two subjects failing and could not graduate immediately.</p>

The college department will also appropriately increase the number of students admitted within a possible range. The first college department enrollment is scheduled to be held on August 2nd and 3rd. The second middle school department enrollment will be held on the same day.

After the opening, banks traded with each other, and the exchange rate was announced by HSBC, with both the UK and the US flat, and the market remained stable. Later, Chinese merchants continued to reduce their long positions. Although the silver equalization tax had not changed, the trend was relatively easy, but because the banks maintained stability, the market gradually returned to stability.

<h3 id="e204">Securities: July Futures Settlement Reached $19 Million; Class C Settlement Was the Highest <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, July 29th, was the settlement date for July futures on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. The total settlement amount was $19,001,000. Excluding self-clearing by brokers, the amount settled at the exchange was $12,785,000, with Class C settlement being the highest, accounting for nearly one-third of the total. Class E was the majority, with over $4 million, and Class D was the least, with only over $1.3 million. Northern buyers accounted for the majority of the deliveries. However, the price of July futures experienced extreme fluctuations, with the highest and lowest prices differing by more than $5 to $7. Since the July contracts began trading on May 17th, the environment has been fraught with thorns. The smuggling situation in North China continued to escalate, and Japan continued to increase its troops in North China, all of which caused invisible damage to the market price. In early June, an unusual event suddenly occurred in South China, the Hong Kong exchange rate soared, the Xiang border became tense, and at the same time, cash fled, and government bond spot prices naturally flowed out, and the market price gradually declined. From June 10th to June 24th, new low prices were seen. As the market price fell, buyers gradually emerged, and as the affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi shifted from tension to softening and eventually to resolution, the aftermath was easier to clean up after Chen Jitang fled. Short players in the market covered their positions one after another, and long players took the opportunity to add to their positions and raise prices, reversing the trend. The market price then rose sharply again. Due to short covering, the upward trend was strong, and Class A bonds rose the most sharply, with new high prices appearing one after another, reaching $71 on July 24th. Although it was suspended due to settlement, the August price was even higher at $70. If the interest rate is calculated, it is even higher by $2 compared to the highest price of $71. The details of the settlement, clearing, and total transaction volume for July are listed below (in units of hundreds of dollars):</p>
<h3 id="e205">Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Was Driven by Sales to Guangdong <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market initially fell but then rebounded, and the situation was slightly stabilized. This was because after several days of consecutive declines, there should be this kind of rebound ability. However, the general retail investors, in view of the faint intentions of long players, coupled with the downward trend of overseas yarn and cotton conditions, are extremely pessimistic about market prices. However, the south has strong buying power from Guangdong due to military pacification and financial consolidation, and the majority of the purchases are local yarn, totaling 2,100 bales.</p>
<p>Call Yarn Initially Fell and Then Rebounded</p>
<p>The opening of the call yarn market was marked by a decline in US cotton futures and a sharp decline in Osaka's three yarn futures. The market sentiment became increasingly weak, and short players were unusually active. Geng Feng, Tai Chang, and Run Kang sold off fiercely, and the surface was oppressed by them. Prices for all months fell by $1.20, and the far months fell by $0.80 to $0.90. After 1:30, prices gradually rebounded. It was reported that Guangdong buyers had strong real demand and purchased smoothly, buying mostly 20-count Chinese yarn. The market sentiment was temporarily boosted, and securities players came to buy in, and the market price turned upward. As a result, the call yarn prices for each month were down by $0.02 to $0.03 in the near months and up by $0.03 to $0.06 in the far months compared to the closing price of the previous day. It was found that Da Fu sold 1,050 bales, Cheng Ji 750 bales, Tong Ji 1,850 bales, Da Feng 600 bales, Yi Ji 1,750 bales, Ming De 2,150 bales, Geng Feng 4,000 bales, Yuan Yi 600 bales, Tai Chang 5,150 bales, Yi Chang 1,750 bales, Run Kang 5,000 bales. Heng Yi bought 2,300 bales, Jin Chang 4,900 bales, Tai Xing 2,500 bales, Zhen Da 850 bales, Shen Chang 850 bales, Sen Kang 2,950 bales, Shen Ji 2,600 bales, Ren Feng 1,650 bales, Chang Feng 3,150 bales, Xie Cheng 1,000 bales, and Heng Chang 1,300 bales.</p>
<p>Guangdong's Yarn Sales Suddenly Rose</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were active. According to statistics, all buyers bought a total of 2,910 bales throughout the day. The goods were stable in price, and thread rose by two dollars. The purchase amounts for each buyer are listed below:</p>
<p>Cotton's Falling Trend Stabilized</p>
<p>The cotton market, which had been falling for several days, showed a slight rebound yesterday. However, the Indian and US cotton markets both saw declines, and market sentiment was inevitably affected. However, some people have absorbed the declines because prices have already fallen by $3 compared to the high prices. However, the recent weather has been favorable for cotton plant growth, and there are still many people selling.</p>
<p>Call Cotton Was Dragged Up by Sen Kang and Others</p>
<p>The opening of the call cotton market was marked by US cotton futures falling by 10 to 14 points due to Southern hedging, Indian cotton falling by 1 to 2 rupees/25, and Osaka's three cotton futures falling by 7, 8, and 9 cents. Market sentiment was even more depressed, and the selling trend was even more intense. August fell sharply by 0.55, October and November fell by 0.03 to 0.10, and December rebounded by 0.05 due to some purchases. After the second trading session, it was reported that yarn sales were brisk, and Sen Kang and Heng Yi worked hard to drag up the prices, and the trading floor was unusually dry. Prices for each month jumped by 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04, and the downward trend was implemented, and the rebound suddenly appeared. In total, old cotton prices rose by 0.05, and new cotton prices rose by 0.01 to 0.02 compared to the previous day's closing price. It was found that Da Feng sold 2,000 dan, Jin Chang 1,600 dan, Zhen Da 1,700 dan, He Xing 2,500 dan, Geng Feng 1,800 dan, Feng Tai 1,100 dan, Yi Chang 6,000 dan, Run Kang 5,700 zu, Yong Chang 2,000 dan, Rui Yuan 1,500 dan.

<p>Cotton Sales Stalled</p>
<p>Current cotton consumption is still sluggish, factory demand is blocked, and the source of Yao cotton is 280 bales.</p>
<p>Overseas Cotton Yarn All Reported Declines</p>
<p>Yesterday's US cotton opening saw poor news from Liverpool, with prices for each month falling by 0 to 6 points. It then rebounded due to lack of rain in Oklahoma, but finally fell again due to liquidation by many parties. This was because the US Cotton Cooperative estimated the cotton harvest to be 12,854,000 bales, and at the same time, Oklahoma predicted rain. Cotton merchants and manufacturers bought spot cotton and hedged with cotton futures. Traders bought on dips, and new accounts outside the industry were limited. At the close, prices slightly recovered due to short covering by some short accounts. Spot prices fell by 13 points, and futures prices fell by 11 to 13 points. British cotton spot prices fell by 8 points, and futures prices fell by 7 to 9 points. The Indian cotton market saw short liquidation, and Japanese merchants bought in. Later, it weakened due to selling by brokers and refiners. Pingguo Er fell by 1 rupee, Aomula fell by 1.25 rupees, and Bai Luoxi fell by 2 to 25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded to the left (dated 28th).</p>
<p>According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the 29th was Bai Luoxi at 230 rupees for the July-August contract, down 2.75 rupees, Bai Luoxi at 219 rupees for the April-May contract, down 2 rupees, Aomula at 199 rupees for the December-January contract, down 2.5 rupees. Yuan 0.70 for the near month, 209.9 yuan for the far month, and 204.3 yuan. Cotton futures fell by 0.09 yuan to 0.15 yuan, 68.8 yuan for the near month, and 64.85 yuan for the far month.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Yarn and Cloth Warehouses Have Abundant Yarn Stocks <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>The amount of yarn stored in the warehouses of the Chinese Merchants Yarn and Cloth Exchange as of July 28th was 36,885 bales. The highest record in 1933 was 37,450 bales, which is not much different. Among them, 20-count Red Kuixing, Flying Boat, Tianguan, Jincheng, and Four Brands were the most numerous, all at 3,100 to 4,300 or 400 bales. The contents of the stored yarn are extracted as follows (in units of bales):</p>
<h3 id="e207">Piece Goods: Autumn Goods, Natural-Colored Twill Velvet; Factory Prices Are Both High <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market conditions showed that the southern business was not strong, and the mood was difficult to boost, because the yarn and cotton trends continued downstream for several days. Moreover, the deadline for paying silver at the end of the month had arrived, and the minds of those holding goods were slightly weak. Fortunately, there was a shortage of spot goods, so the market situation was firm. The selling prices of various goods were roughly the same as before. There were not many customer orders, and this was also because of the lack of greige cloth. Tianjin buyers bought 50 to 60 pieces of light-weight coarse cloth and oblique fabric from the Yihua factory. Shandong buyers bought more than 100 cases of new flower crepe, wool flannel, and other goods from various factories. Nanchang buyers bought 50 pieces of crepe-patterned wool serge, printed straight serge, printed cloth, and low-grade fine twill and fine cloth from various factories. Shantou and Guangzhou buyers have gradually added to their purchases as the situation eased and the Cantonese currency soared. Guangzhou buyers continued to purchase large quantities of fine twill, and Shantou buyers bought 50 pieces of striped plain silk, fine cloth, fine twill, printed cloth, and other goods. Due to seasonal factors, door-to-door sales and sales to Jiangzhe inland buyers were the most sluggish. Natural-colored twill velvet, an autumn good, has recently been launched. The Dasheng factory's tram brand is selling at $7.20 for 9-pound, $8.90 for 13-pound, and $10.03 for 16-pound. According to last year's sales prices, it was $5.90 for 9-pound, $7.70 for 13-pound, and $9.01 for 16-pound, an increase of $1.23 per piece. Shenxin's 14-pound red car brand is selling at $8.50, compared to $8 last year, an increase of $0.50. Qingfeng factory's double fish Jiqing brand is selling at $7.50 for 9-pound, $9.40 for 13-pound, and $10.08 for 16-pound, compared to last year's prices of $5.06 for 9-pound, $7.06 for 13-pound, and $9.01 for 16-pound, an increase of $1.70 to $0.90 per piece. The factory's double fish Jiqing brand has been the most popular in sales for many years. Last year, due to higher prices, sales had already declined by more than half. Based on this year's sales prices, it is feared that sales will become even more sluggish.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Food: Japanese Merchants' Wheat; Futures Flour and Wheat Rebounded Together <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices of each month rose together. The quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago, continued to rise by $0.40, and Canada rose by $0.35, and so on. Market sentiment was stirred because foreign wheat had been rising for several days in a row. Moreover, Japanese merchants continued to export spot wheat, and although the amount was not large, it was ultimately considered an unusual event. Therefore, after the opening price, the near month was raised by one cent immediately, and the far month was raised by two to three cents. Later, because floating shorts continued to cover smoothly, there were no new short positions, and the factories did not hedge sell, so the asking price became tighter again. Compared to the previous day, the near month was better by one to two cents, and the far month was up by three to four cents. After observation, if spot sales are sluggish, it will not be overly profitable.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, the prices of each month rose together. The quoted price of foreign wheat also rose by $0.30, $0.40, and $0.05, and so on. The rumors in the market that Japanese merchants were buying spot wheat were heard in several cases. Although the total amount was not very large, the attention of both domestic and foreign players could not help but be drawn. However, in terms of quantity, it was said that it was only about 60,000 to 70,000 bags, which can be said to be insignificant. Therefore, to revive because of this is an overreaction. At the initial opening, it was immediately raised by 0.03 and 0.04, and then raised by 0.05 and 0.06. The price of November rose the most due to the largest amount of short covering, up by $0.10 alone, while the rest rose by 0.07, 0.08, and 0.09. The spot wheat market saw factory demand still not smooth, and the middle price remained unchanged. The special high-quality goods were raised by $0.04 and $0.05. Kai Yaowan and Suzhou wheat were at $4.56, and Mingguang and other high-quality wheat were at $4.60. Each factory went to more than 3,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Indica Rice Is Still Being Sold at a Lower Price <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of guest indica rice was still strong, and the source from the Yangtze River area was endless. Moreover, new rice from various routes continued to enter the market, and the production price became increasingly lower. However, guest processing was still strong, and Sichuan buyers were even more active. Yesterday, Shantou, Guangzhou, and Northern buyers, who had been silent for a long time, inquired. The rice market continued to maintain a strong position. However, cargo owners and hoarders were still eager to sell, and new arrivals were mostly sold at a lower price. Therefore, the hope of market recovery remained weak. Sichuan buyers purchased more than 4,000 bags of medium and final rice, Guangzhou buyers only purchased 200 bags of rough late rice, Shantou buyers purchased hundreds of bags of Xiangjing, and Northern buyers purchased a small amount of Guangdong machine rice. The rest were purchased by the local street. In total, 8,859 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,200 bags of Hunan rice, 500 bags of Guangdong rice, and 48 bags of Wenzhou rice were traded in the unified market.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various buyers still only arrived at the 13th and 14th, with a total of 2,400 to 2,500 stone of goods. The local street sales market was still clear, and the Qingdao Dasi buyers only bought more than 500 bags, so it was still difficult to boost the market situation. The market for thin and thick rice was opening. The high-quality Zhenxian goods were stable, the medium-quality ones were depreciating by a few points, and the old and secondary ones were rarely inquired about. Duyang pointed rice was down by $0.05 to $0.06, and Yinbian Yuanhe had no goods and no market.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 16 to 17 ships arrived from various buyers in Hexia, and the road for various goods on the market was very slow. High-quality white japonica rice was scarce on the market, and the price was flat and weak. The price of medium-quality rice was slightly lower by $0.06 to $0.07, early rice was scarce, and the price was firm. The price of thin rice was slightly higher by a few cents, the price of Yuanhe rice was flat, the price of various indica rice was firm for fresh and high-quality, and the middle and secondary ones were also seen to be becoming weak and soft. The price of the rest of the goods was peaceful.</p>

<p>New Jin Cai: Since the establishment of the company, the selling price has been able to be consistent, but the bottom price seems to be not very small. Now that there are abundant harvests everywhere, the market atmosphere is downstream, and it is inevitable that it will also be affected. Yesterday, it was heard that the company had opened up to the town buyers, opening up 200 packages of Daxingcai, etc., with prices ranging from 10 yuan to 17 or 18 yuan. In order to make the market price flat and straight, the company will sell it to the Guangdong buyers at the opened price without commission, in order to promote sales and make the price on the right track every day. Yesterday, more than 100 packages of Xuzhoucai arrived, the buyer called for 18 yuan, the company offered 17 yuan, and the transaction has not yet been completed. There is a soft falling image in the latter market.</p>
<p>Xu Kuizi: Yesterday, it was heard that a certain line rushed to handle several pieces, with a bright and dark color, and the identity of the film group was also impressive. The large line disk was at the 17 yuan level, but the number was very small and it was not enough to be regarded as a positive market.</p>

<p>The sugar market was stable yesterday. The association divided the market. The spot price of 24 coarse sand white was 21.88 yuan, the transit goods were 6.09 yuan to 0.08 yuan, and the 8th Holland red was slightly divided out at 16 yuan. The price of 8th TM mark of Dongbai transit goods was 6.5 yuan, which was 0.05 yuan lower. The price of 9th TM mark was 6.025 yuan, which was also 0.05 yuan lower. There was no upper or lower fluctuation for the rest. Ben Guang cotton white Zhen Ji and other No. 1 were still 20.5 yuan. The buyers in the buyer's goods tide continued to open more than 600 packages, and the higher price was 12.78 yuan, which was up another 0.02 yuan. Huayoubao was 12.06 yuan. Jianbang opened up more than 70 packages of Zhang red, with a price of 13.2 yuan to 12.2 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the joint company held the second tender for Cantonese coarse white this week. The quota was set at 8,237 packages, and the bidding price was the same as before. There were still few recipients. It was decided to sell 10 packages of Dongguan factory's five sheep group white for 21.7 yuan, and another 35 packages from Quxi factory for 21.03 yuan. The city's sand white was 50 packages, and the price was 19.02 yuan. There were few transactions. It was heard that Dundee factory's five sheep coarse white will continue to arrive. Its raw material is refined from Dutch sugar. The color and appearance are both excellent. It has been decided to sell it by tender next Monday.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the New York silk market was quite bullish, and Japanese silk and Chinese silk all rose by another 0.04. The current month's spot goods have not been auctioned. The selling price of the standard silk in the marun month was up by 0.035 compared to the previous sale. The prices of forward goods were also very high. The current spot goods in Yokohama continued to rise by 14 yuan to 18 yuan. However, the French silk market still showed no progress, and the prices of various silk products remained unchanged. Due to the sudden rise in overseas silk prices, Shanghai silk mills were even more determined to hold on to their prices. Moreover, this year there was a bumper harvest of summer silkworms in Zhejiang, and the autumn silkworms have not yet been determined to be abundant or scarce. Silkworm eggs are consistently viewed as high. Therefore, silk transactions were still not smooth yesterday.</p>

Keemun black tea sales have already reached 50,000 boxes, Ningzhou tea sales have exceeded 8,000 boxes, and flower-scented tea sales have reached 15,000 boxes, accounting for eight-tenths of the total. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson, a British trading company, again purchased a large quantity, finalizing deals for more than 1,200 boxes at a price of forty-seven to forty-eight yuan, further stabilizing the market. As for green tea sales, they vary in smoothness. Needle, eyebrow, and pearl teas are selling well, but the most important category, "Zhen Mei" (Precious Eyebrow), has not seen any improvement.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Tea Trade Association, the tea market is still difficult to develop and transactions are scattered. Yesterday, Xiehe (協和) made a small number of deals for Zhen Mei tea at prices from one hundred and ten to one hundred and fifteen yuan, a decrease of five or six yuan compared to before. Ordinary Tunxi (屯溪) and Wuyuan (婺源) Zhen Mei teas continue to be purchased, with prices ranging from seventy-three to seventy-six yuan. There are also sporadic transactions in small needle eyebrow teas and shrimp eye teas, but the selling price is slightly weak. Only the Baishou (白頭) tea sold at the Gongxi (貢熙) market is active; high-grade teas are out of stock, and even the special Gongxi teas of medium grade are sold as soon as they arrive, with prices ranging from sixty to seventy yuan. There has been slight activity in large batches of Pingshui tea lately. Samsung, Kuaili, and Jingwei teas have all been transacted, but large boxes of tea are no longer in season.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Metals: East White Iron Market is Dull and Unremarkable <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the two Japanese factories, Zhongshan and Asia, in this port for East White Iron, goods from Osaka have been unable to come to Shanghai due to import taxes. (Because the cost of goods from Japan is twenty cents higher than the factory price here, the market has been eliminated in Shanghai). Therefore, the two factories here have been competing to ship goods, trying to sell them. The market price for standard sizes such as three by seven feet has dropped from one yuan and ten cents per sheet to one yuan, and the price for three by six feet has dropped from ninety cents to eighty-one or two cents. Although the price of thick white iron from foreign countries has recently soared (and the market here is also very brisk), the East White Iron market remains dull and unremarkable. This is because the two factories are fiercely competing, and buyers are fickle, so the market price cannot recover for the time being. There are few export transactions (due to the lack of permits), but sales within Shanghai are strong. It is estimated that the two factories ship an average of about 10,000 sheets per day, with more than 6,000 sheets sold in Shanghai. As for exports, they only amount to about 2,000 sheets.</p>

<h3 id="e216">Needle in the Muddy Sea: The Failure and Success of Treating Gonorrhea <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Zongkun, Imperial Medical University of Japan</p>
<p>The world’s most effective gonorrhea medication is only a non-specific preparation.</p>
<p>The treatment of gonorrhea cannot be effectively achieved through specialized local methods alone. It relies on the body's natural healing power to generate significant resistance, so that the gonococci have nowhere to escape amidst the relentless attacks and are ultimately annihilated. Therefore, the "membrane-penetrating sterilization" therapy of the past has recently been abandoned by specialists, who no longer wish to use these local anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents.</p>
<p>Consequently, scholars have turned to new scientific methods to extract pigment agents. According to clinical trials by general practitioners, although these agents are highly effective, they also have many side effects. If their inferior components are completely removed, their medicinal effects are also lost. Therefore, many pigment-based gonorrhea treatments today are not very effective.</p>
<p>According to experiments by Drs. Salomon en U. Ma seh, gonorrhea can only be completely cured by employing non-specific therapy to generate systemic antibodies. This method involves taking proteins from animals and plants, as well as bile, to stimulate the phagocytic action of white blood cells and induce immunity. Once immunity is achieved, there is no risk of gonorrhea recurrence. This protein is then combined with purified pigment agents to create the modern, internationally popular non-specific therapy "Kerinong" oral gonorrhea medication, which effectively treats chronic male gonorrhea, prostatitis, cystitis, orchitis, and other conditions, yielding rapid results. Eight or nine bottles can cure chronic gonorrhea. About four or five bottles can achieve full efficacy for acute gonorrhea (there is no miracle cure with only one or two bottles). For female gonorrhea, in addition to taking this medication, "Kaerxuedishi Vaginal Tablets" can be used externally as suppositories to cure gonorrhea of the vulva, vagina, and uterus. Both medications have no side effects, and the internal use of "Kerinong" does not harm the stomach. Patients can boldly use it for self-treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Residents Beware: After the Weather Warms Up <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>The number of gastroenteritis cases has surged!</p>
<p>After the weather warms up, epidemics are spreading rampantly. According to statistics from the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Xizang Road in this city, most patients in recent days have been suffering from gastroenteritis. Why is gastroenteritis so prevalent in the summer? According to medical experts, this is due to residents' carelessness regarding diet and sleep, excessive indulgence in cold foods and drinks, or even accidental consumption of spoiled food containing large amounts of bacteria. This leads to bacterial growth in the stomach and intestines, causing fermentation of the contents and resulting in inflammation. Consequently, symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting of sour fluid, head heaviness, headache, fever, and loss of appetite occur. Based on my clinical experience, this condition can be treated with the German medication "Qiang Wei Jing." It cleanses the putrid substances in the stomach, eliminates fermentation in the intestines, and reduces congestion. Within a short period, a complete cure can be achieved, avoiding other dangers (such as dysentery).</p>
<p>As for when gastroenteritis turns chronic, leading to symptoms such as loss of appetite, chest tightness, belching, acid reflux, stomach sluggishness, heart and stomach pain, as well as indigestion, constipation, or rapid intestinal peristalsis leading to watery diarrhea and malabsorption resulting in loose stools, "Qiang Wei Jing," with its unique effects of internal food fermentation and spleen essence, can effectively treat these conditions. It is also very suitable for treating infant milk vomiting and green stools. Its nature is mild and beneficial, unmatched by other preparations. It is also effective in treating beriberi caused by vitamin B deficiency, as it contains abundant vitamin B.</p>
<h3 id="e218">A Short Discussion on Gonorrhea <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Wu Zhonglin, Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>An Example That Cannot Be Ignored</p>
<p>Since graduating from college, I have been working in society. Because venereal diseases, especially gonorrhea, are prevalent in society, I have had contact with many patients of this kind. Therefore, I find it even more difficult to choose oral medications for gonorrhea. Because many gonorrhea medications these days are really hard to choose, not only are patients deceived, but sometimes I am also misled. However, as time goes by, I gain more experience. Based on my many years of experience, the most effective medication for gonorrhea is "Kerinong," and it has no side effects. One patient had gonorrhea for three or four years. After examination, it was found to be cystitis. Because I believed that "Kerinong" was the most effective medication, I prescribed it after surgery. After five weeks, he was completely cured. His wife also suffered from gonorrhea-related leukorrhea for a long time. She was also cured by taking "Kerinong" internally and "Ka'er Vaginal Tablets" externally. This is one example. The following is another example, a self-report from a patient named Zhao, who was also cured by me.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Gonorrhea Patients Cry Out for Justice! <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>A man named Zhao Yongfeng came to me for treatment, saying that last month he contracted gonorrhea after occasionally visiting brothels. He saw an advertisement in the newspaper for a newly released medication for white discharge and, misled by the advertisement, rashly purchased and took it. Unexpectedly, he soon experienced vomiting. Initially, the urethra did not feel very painful, but after taking this inferior medication, the purulent discharge suddenly stopped, and he could not urinate. The urethra almost ruptured. Therefore, he came to me for help, saying that he was filled with regret. I immediately performed surgery to remove the pus and blood that had accumulated in the patient's urethra and saw that the urethral mucosa was already festering. I urgently administered the bactericidal and antiseptic "Kerinong." After about three weeks, all inflammation, festering, swelling, and pain had subsided. The urine was also clear. Several blood tests were conducted, and there was no gonorrheal reaction, proving a complete cure. From this, we know that gonorrhea sufferers must carefully choose their medication.</p>

<p>Chronic Prostatitis</p>
<p>Gonorrheal prostatitis is a common secondary complication of gonorrhea. Therefore, almost nineteen out of every ten gonorrhea patients have symptoms of prostatitis. This is due to physiological factors, making it easy for gonococci to invade. It is relatively easy to treat in the early stages, but if left untreated, it will cause years of suffering and lead to prostatic leakage, which greatly impairs reproductive ability. Patients often experience a discharge of flocculent pus after urination, inducing difficulty in ejaculation. Even after forced ejaculation, there is often bloody discharge. If a urethroscopic examination is performed, there will be a ruptured abscess in the posterior urethra, as the prostate is damaged and bleeding. This obstructs the urethra, making ejaculation difficult, proving that this condition has existed for a long time.</p>
<p>However, if this condition has not reached a critical stage, it can still be salvaged. First, surgery, electrotherapy, and intravenous injections are administered. At the same time, the anti-inflammatory and bactericidal "Kerinong" is prescribed. After three or four weeks, a urethroscopic examination will reveal that the inflammation of the mucosa has subsided. Continued use of "Kerinong" will ensure a complete recovery. This medication has the functions of reducing inflammation and swelling, antisepticizing, and promoting diuresis, hence its rapid effectiveness. This most advanced therapy has been praised by European and American physicians. However, because this is a chronic disease of many years, prostatic fluid and semen may be injected into the vagina during intercourse, posing a risk of uterine gonorrhea and vaginitis. If the wife unfortunately contracts this condition, "Kaerxuedishi Vaginal Tablets" can be used externally as suppositories, and "Kerinong" can be taken internally to turn danger into safety and completely eradicate the disease.</p>

<p>The Importance of Drug Therapy for Pulmonary Diseases</p>
<p>In recent years, although no specific drugs have been invented to eliminate tubercle bacilli in the human body and invigorate human tissue cells for the treatment of pulmonary diseases, rest, diet, and fresh air have been found to improve the chances of recovery. However, these are only indirect therapies and not the only absolute method to completely cure tuberculosis. Surgical procedures, such as artificial pneumothorax, are effective, but cannot be applied to every patient. Therefore, drug therapy cannot be disregarded by physicians, as it not only alleviates the patient's suffering but also reduces the duration of treatment. However, among the many pulmonary medications, only the German "Bu Fei San Er" does not cause any adverse effects on human tissues. Based on my experience, this medication can suppress coughs, alter all severe pain symptoms of tuberculosis, prevent complications, and reduce the scope of lesions. Therefore, tuberculosis with symptoms such as coughing up phlegm and blood, night sweats and tidal fever caused by tuberculous toxins, chest tightness, reduced appetite, emaciation, and chest pain due to pleurisy can be completely cured by taking this medication. If taken continuously for more than a month, complete elimination of tuberculous foci can be achieved, with no recurrence. However, attention must still be paid to recuperation after recovery to avoid losing all previous efforts. Because "Bu Fei San Er" is good at relieving phlegm and suppressing coughs, it can also cure colds, infantile pertussis, asthma, and chronic bronchitis.</p>
<p>If tuberculosis patients experience excessive weakness, they can simultaneously take the male tonic "Bu Ti Kang" to invigorate endocrine function and cure seminal emission and kidney atrophy (but seminal emission is best treated with the specific medication "Nai Shi Yu Jing Pian" to suppress it). Women can also take "Bu Nu Rong" to regulate menstruation and replenish blood, correcting ovarian function. In this way, nervous breakdown, insomnia, palpitations, dizziness, and headaches in both male and female patients can gradually subside as the tuberculosis decreases.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Random Talks on Venereal Diseases: The Impact of Semen Loss on the Human Body <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Dai De</p>
<p>Seminal emission, nocturnal emission (emission with dreams), spermatorrhea (slippage of semen during exertion or urination), these losses of semen are most harmful to the body, especially the nervous system. Semen contains a large amount of protein, and its loss will inevitably hinder nutrition and cause insufficient metabolism of the nervous system. Because of the reduction of body protein, seminal emission patients often suffer from blood deficiency and weakness, and are often unable to marry.</p>
<p>This disease is mostly caused by masturbation. If sedatives are taken and cold water baths are taken, there is no reason not to recover completely. "Yu Jing Pian" has a great effect in treating seminal emission, nocturnal emission, and spermatorrhea, which has been proven by numerous physician trials. If patients are excessively weak, experience premature ejaculation, sore waist, headache, and forgetfulness, they can simultaneously take "Bu Ti Kang" to invigorate endocrine function and supplement protein, which will achieve twice the result with half the effort. Zhongxi Yong'an sells these products.</p>
<h3 id="e223">How to Eliminate Leukorrhea <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Jin Yueren</p>
<p>"Nine out of ten women suffer from leukorrhea," as the saying goes. This shows how prevalent leukorrhea is among women. However, because the causes are unclear, few are able to eliminate and cure it. This condition can be caused by mechanical stimulation, such as masturbation and rough sexual intercourse, by husbands infected with gonorrhea, or by incomplete development and physical weakness. Sufferers often experience infiltration and erosion in the affected area, lower abdominal pain, and irregular menstruation, often leading to various uterine diseases and diseases of organs near the uterus. Statistics show that leukorrhea is also one of the causes of infertility.</p>
<p>The fundamental treatment for this disease is none other than the German "Kaerxuedishi Vaginal Tablets," with one tablet inserted into the vagina as a suppository every night. However, if it is caused by gonorrhea, "Kerinong" can be taken internally. If it is caused by incomplete development, physical weakness, and irregular menstruation, "Bu Nu Rong" can be taken internally. By following this method of treatment, it is not difficult to eliminate this stubborn leukorrhea.</p>

<p>The Latest Trends in Endocrine Preparations</p>
<p>Since the establishment of endocrinology by the German Berthold and the French Ciaud Bernard, medical experts in various countries have shown great interest in the study of endocrinology. Many endocrine preparations have been produced, but they vary in quality and refinement. Therefore, their efficacy often fails to achieve the expected results. Because of this, many scholars have adopted a skeptical attitude towards endocrine therapy. However, the contribution of endocrine therapy to medicine cannot be denied by a few failed researchers. The reason for these failures lies in the incomplete scientific methods.</p>
<p>The reason why previous scholars failed in their research on endocrine preparations is that they did not select animals carefully and lacked sophisticated scientific methods for preparation, resulting in crude products with unsustainable efficacy. Among them, the research of the German Meilun was particularly diligent, and his achievements were the greatest. The male tonic "Bu Ti Kang" and the female tonic "Bu Nu Rong" that he invented are the latest successful evidence of endocrine preparations. The ingredients of these two drugs are prepared by selecting strong and healthy animals, using scientific methods to extract fresh hormones from their testicles and ovaries, removing crude and impure components, and then preparing them separately. They are effective for conditions such as incomplete development of the male genitalia, seminal emission, premature ejaculation, weak erection, flat and thin female breasts and buttocks that resemble a male's, delayed menstruation, scanty menstrual flow, chlorosis, and infertility in both sexes, headaches, insomnia, palpitations, forgetfulness, sore waist and weak legs, depression, and all other symptoms. After taking these preparations, the youth glands can be restored to normal function, fully developed, and all the above symptoms can be eliminated. This is the most recent and effective evidence of endocrine preparations.</p>

<p>— Essentials of Dr. Yao Juyan's Clinical Practice</p>
<p>Misleading Words</p>
<p>Mr. Jin Shaoyun contracted gonorrhea in the army two years ago. Although he was injected with Vakzin by the army doctor, he was not completely cured, and the condition dragged on. Later, it developed into a combination of prostatitis and posterior urethritis. His mental and physical well-being suffered greatly. He came to Shanghai to recuperate and was introduced by a friend to my clinic for treatment. I instructed him to purchase and take the effective gonorrhea medication "Kerinong." However, Mr. Jin was misled by others and purchased a cheap, inferior medication. After taking it, his condition worsened. He then brought the bottle of the inferior medication for a follow-up visit. I immediately instructed him to make sure he recognized the three characters "Kerinong." Sure enough, after taking "Kerinong" for four weeks, all symptoms disappeared. This is sufficient evidence of the quality of gonorrhea medications. Because of his previous gonorrhea, Mr. Jin had developed neurasthenia, insomnia, headache, and seminal emission. I also recommended "Bu Ti Kang" to strengthen his weak body and "Yu Jing Pian" to treat his seminal emission. After taking these medications for two weeks, all his symptoms were cured, and his body became stronger than ever.</p>
<p>Almost Divorced</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Wuhe contracted gonorrhea after leaving the Jai Alai Ballroom one evening and entering a brothel. He underwent repeated treatments, but with little effect. He also infected his wife with a severe case of gonorrhea-related leukorrhea. As a result, the couple's relationship deteriorated day by day, and they almost divorced. Fortunately, Mr. Lu Zhongxin, a cousin of his wife, mediated and introduced Mr. Xu to my clinic for treatment. After a scientific examination, I determined that Mr. Xu's condition had developed into paraurethritis. I prescribed "Kerinong" to kill bacteria, reduce inflammation, promote diuresis, and relieve pain. After about four or five weeks, he was completely cured. His wife used "Kaer Vaginal Tablets" externally as suppositories to treat the leukorrhea, and she also took "Kerinong" internally to treat the gonorrhea. She recovered in less than four weeks. The couple reconciled as before.</p>
<p>Social Problem</p>
<p>Mr. Xie Songshi is honest, kind, and cautious. He is thirty years old, but still single. It is not that he is unattractive, but that he lacks the financial means to marry. One evening, he passed through a red-light district and was seduced by evil influences, contracting gonorrhea. Several days later, he felt an itching in his penis like ants crawling, and gradually secreted tea-green urine. His urethral opening was blocked by pus, making urination difficult, and the frenulum of his foreskin was swollen and painful, causing him untold suffering. Medication was ineffective. He consulted Dr. Chen Shaohua, who introduced him to my clinic for treatment. I prescribed the effective medication "Kerinong." After two bottles, his condition improved, his urine became clear, and his urethra was free of discharge. Fearing a relapse, he continued to take four bottles and was completely cured. The fact that even a cautious and honest person like Mr. Xie can suffer from this disease shows that gonorrhea is indeed a social disease, and Mr. Xie himself should not be blamed.</p>

<h3 id="e227">The Issue of Qualifications for Elementary School Teachers <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Ping</p>
<p>Recently, we have seen that education authorities, while rectifying and improving elementary school education, have paid special attention to the issue of qualifications for elementary school teachers: on the one hand, increasing the salaries of elementary school teachers and guaranteeing their tenure; on the other hand, starting with conducting qualification registration to restrict teaching qualifications, or rather, to raise the standard of teachers. At the same time, we have also seen the promulgation of the revised Elementary School Regulations. These regulations were revised based on the research results of educational institutions in various provinces and cities, and the experience of implementing elementary school education in various places. In these revised regulations, we have also seen the addition of issues related to elementary school teacher qualifications, such as appointment, treatment, and security. We find this very gratifying. The issue of elementary school teacher qualifications, which has always attracted attention, is now receiving such importance, although the results (methods) of this emphasis are not fully satisfactory, it is nevertheless a good phenomenon.</p>
<p>Elementary school education is the most fundamental education. In the stages of education, it is like the foundation of a building. It is the first step in education. Whether in training or cultivation, this is a very important stage. To cultivate good citizens, or to put it more plainly—to improve education, the first step must be to improve elementary school education. However, without being polite, our country's elementary school education is frankly and honestly corrupt. There is no need to mention the difficulties in the inland. Even in a large city like Shanghai, the corruption of elementary school education does not require any proof. Of course, the reasons for the corruption of elementary school education are multifaceted. Here, we will only take the issue of teacher qualifications as an example.</p>
<p>Most people have a mentality of aiming too high. The common general concept is that they often disdain the cause of education, very much like walking on the road of teaching is a sure way to starve to death. This is especially feared by elementary school teachers. However, we can say that this kind of person does not understand education. Although teaching is difficult, it is quite important, especially for elementary school teachers. Since elementary school is the beginning of education, if the teacher is not good, the bad influence will be irreversible. At the same time, the curriculum of elementary school is multifaceted, and the psychology of children is somewhat specially constructed. If one is not rich in common sense and does not have special research on children's psychology, one is not competent. Therefore, here we feel that: generally competent people who can become elementary school teachers do not take up teaching, this is the mistake of the general "climbing up" mentality. Therefore, the abuse of elementary school teachers has become one of the causes of the corruption of elementary school education.</p>
<p>However, we cannot blame them deeply. The main thing is still the issue of elementary school teacher salaries. Not long ago, we heard about a teacher in Xuzhou committing suicide on an empty stomach. As for salary arrears or lack of security, there are too many to count. It is especially terrible in Shanghai. An elementary school teacher is often worse off than a worker. Not to mention salary, even the food is not necessarily human treatment. This is correct. How can one teach on an empty stomach? Who is willing to be an elementary school teacher?</p>
<p>Now, teacher qualifications are restricted. Treatment, security, etc. are all stipulated in official documents. However, what we need is implementation, not just another piece of paper, a blank check to deceive the common people sitting on the cold bench to be happy.</p>

<p>There, a bench was pulled over, and all sorts of people gathered to watch the spectacle, surrounding it in layers. The woman in the silk trousersuit had a face full of pockmarks, lips so thin they didn't reveal any red, but her eyes had an unusual gleam, rolling busily. The sunlight had devoured her fair skin, giving it the same glossy sheen as her clothes. And the one behind her? Silent, fanning a large palm-leaf fan, the breeze touching both of them – needless to say, that was her assistant.</p>
<p>Her hand opened, examining the crisscrossing lines, guessing the age, scrutinizing the features, rolling her eyes a few times. Following her usual method – take gold and jade hands and leave, your hand has lines of gold, no worries about clothes and food, treat people kindly and get no good in return. Just one pause, then, "What does your husband do?"</p>
<p>The woman's face flushed red, lowering her head. The people around snickered. Someone spoke up for her, "She's not married yet!"</p>
<p>"In terms of appearance, you should have good luck this year. Fifteen or sixteen years, your parents took care of it, twenty-something, you took care of it yourself. However, in August..." Her eyes rolled again, calculating the number, "You need to avoid three things: red foods, mirrors, and clothes drying in the sun. These can directly affect your good fortune – understand?"</p>
<p>"Understand," of course she understood. "Then – exactly which day?" the woman asked, convinced.</p>
<p>"The hour can't be known," her mind was laughing, the hour required careful consideration.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the face reading didn't involve "careful consideration," and careful consideration required a considerable price. Finally, she was disappointed, repeating the entire spiel, looking blankly, asking hesitantly, "Does anyone want their fortune told? Can you look at children's luck?"</p>
<p>"Why doesn't she look at her own?" I couldn't help but ask. "How much does this trade earn in a day?"</p>
<p>"She's a camel, pulling her along is the magic. As for earning a living? Unreliable, it all depends on luck."</p>
<p>She left, pressed by the demands of life. Fortune telling? Destiny? Why didn't she make her own destiny better? In the alley, different discussions were being held!</p>

<p>— Xu Ji</p>
<p>The night was suffocatingly hot and humid, the sky was murky and dim, the atmosphere weighed heavily, pressing down on people, making it hard to breathe, as if harboring a great hatred and determination to crush these suffocating creatures into powder. Before going to sleep, people were anxious, exhausted like a pile of mud after a day of hard and hopeless work in the scorching fields. They often raised their heads, looking at the black, impossibly high sky, as if complaining about some unspeakable sorrow and misfortune. The sky was murky and black, clouds were moving heavily, as if about to rain or thunder. "I'm afraid a big thunderstorm is coming—why isn't it here yet? It's so hot, it's going to bake people to death!"</p>
<p>People all hoped for a terrible thunderstorm, so that perhaps it could moisten the land and wash it clean. Moreover, after the terrible thunderstorm, the weather would clear up, there would be a slight breeze in the fields, the sky would be azure blue, and small, bright and clear stars would twinkle in the sky...</p>
<p>However, the night had already deepened, and people were inheriting the terrible nightmares of their lives in sorrow, while the sky was still woodenly and silently dim. Inside the house, in the darkness, swarms of mosquitoes flew buzzing. Outside, in the not-so-distant pond, green mussels were calling out in a turbid, unclear voice...</p>
<p>Turning over, pulling at the tattered and dirty mat, in the swarm of buzzing mosquitoes, Granny Changlin, who was over sixty years old, burst into a loud cry again: "Oh, oh! What's going on! What kind of world is this becoming..." The terrible sleep-talking cry broke through the deathly silence of midnight, and Old Man Weilin, dozing on the couch, was also awakened. He frowned, and sighed heavily, as if forgiving someone. When he was fully awake, he resentfully and angrily rushed inside, grabbed the crying old woman by the hand, and shook her desperately: "You old thing! Wake up! Wake up! Are you going crazy again? Do you want to die!"</p>
<p>Tears streaming down her face, Granny Changlin was awakened from a terrible nightmare she had never had before. A surge of anger and sorrow constantly surged in her aging brain, and sobs and whimpers turned her hoarse voice into a string of disjointed, primitive sounds. But, even with so much effort, she finally used all her courage and difficulty to describe some terrible things: "I dreamed of our Changlin... covered in blood... he was killed by ×× people, like killing a pig..."</p>
<p>It's like a stone sinking into the sea when a person is gone. It's been half a month, and there's still no news at all. Who knows where he's lost in the world?</p>
<p>However, finally thinking of a great solution, with a begging tone, Granny Changlin said to her "old man" again: "Tomorrow, you go to the street to inquire again..."</p>
<p>"Go to sleep! Where to inquire?"</p>
<p>She didn't have the courage to continue speaking. The old man lay down on the broken bed, sighed, and his moist, presbyopic eyes looked straight out from the night sky: everything was dark. Mosquitoes were flying and calling. Frogs were croaking in the nearby pond. The sky was black, the atmosphere was heavy and suffocating, and the hot air was steaming like fog. There wasn't even a hint of wind around...</p>
<p>Old Man Changlin suddenly paused for a moment, and a painful, bone-chilling sting rushed out from the bottom of his heart, trampling on him fiercely! But he finally endured it, as if harboring an even greater resentment, changed to a slightly rough tone, and said in a low voice: "Don't go so crazy! How could such a thing happen...? Don't shout and scream like that. There's a curfew outside today, and there are sentries nearby. It's not a joke if they hear it..."</p>
<p>"What's the big deal? At most, it's just dying. Being over sixty, I still have to suffer that kind of torment, watching my son being caught, for so long, not knowing if he's dead or alive! What's the point of me living? Let me die, let them come and arrest me!"</p>
<p>However, even though she said that, at the thought of the gun butts and bayonets of those robber-like soldiers, she unconsciously lowered her voice. Such a strong man of thirty-six! Changlin, pulling a rickshaw on the street, argued with those "devil" soldiers over not paying the rickshaw fare, got drunk in a small tavern at night, and then babbled and nagged for a while, scolding and scolding, and was caught by detectives...</p>

<p>The tide has come, we have untied the ropes, and with the full sails, we are at sea.</p>
<p>Our masts are spinning seven-colored bright lights. On the azure sea, under the moonlight, the sparse boats in the distance are swaying, the white sails like a dream.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the roaring sound of the waves, we sang. The low-flying seabirds shook their wings and applauded us. We are the gypsies of the sea, last year we spent early autumn on the Mediterranean coast, stroking the withered yellow grape leaves, chasing after our motherland, now it is summer, we are leaving the country again, gradually getting farther and farther away. The eyes that were hoping have withered, only the singing voice is still the same as in previous years. We sing, for the sea, for our melancholy, I sing endlessly. We love the sea, the sea is our relative, but no one in the world knows the sea in our hearts!</p>
<p>Dreams are lost in the vast waves. In the sound of the waves, I smell the fragrance of orange blossoms from my hometown, and I also see my mother's hair as silky, white, white. Like the silver light on the sea waves. And what about our hope?</p>
<p>The night is getting darker, the constellations are whispering, and the edges are revealing some secrets. The never-blinking waves, like our relatives, are always gazing at us, but our relatives are gradually getting farther and farther away.</p>
<p>How can I stop the dark shadows of memory from returning to my heart? When will the misfortunes of many years be relieved? Like a consumptive woman looking forward to her tomorrow, but by tomorrow her singing voice will have already become hoarse. Youth is like a illusory hope, like a strand of silk, blown away by the wind from beyond the sky.</p>
<p>Only the sea sounds endlessly melancholic, accompanying our songs. Now the sea is also dim, and I am also sobbing, because we have left our hometown, if the orchard is already far away.</p>

<h3 id="e232">The Qualification Problem of Elementary School Teachers <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Jianping</p>
<p>Recently, we have seen that the education authorities, in the rectification and improvement of elementary school education, have paid special attention to the issue of the qualifications of elementary school teachers. On the one hand, they are improving the treatment of elementary school teachers and guaranteeing their tenure. On the other hand, they are starting with the organization of certification and registration to restrict the qualifications of teachers, or rather, to raise the standards for teachers. At the same time, we have also seen the promulgation of the revised elementary school regulations, which are based on the research results of education authorities in various provinces and cities, and the experience of implementing elementary school education in various places. In these revised regulations, we have also seen the special addition of issues related to the qualifications of elementary school teachers, such as appointment, treatment, guarantee, and so on. We feel that this is very gratifying. The issue of the qualifications of elementary school teachers, which has always attracted attention, is now receiving such attention. Although the results (methods) of this attention are not fully satisfactory, it is not necessarily a bad phenomenon.</p>
<p>Elementary school education is the most fundamental education. In the stage of education, it is like the foundation of a building, the first step in education. Whether in training or cultivation, this is a very important stage. To cultivate good people, or to put it more clearly—to improve education, the first step is to improve elementary school education. However, to be frank, elementary school education in our country is terribly corrupt. Leaving aside the interior, which is limited by various difficulties, even in Shanghai, this big city, the corruption of elementary school education really does not need much evidence. Of course, there are many reasons why elementary school education is corrupt. Here, we will only take the issue of teacher qualifications as an example.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, people have a psychology of aiming high. The common general concept is often dismissive of the education industry, as if embarking on the path of teaching is undoubtedly a path to starvation, especially for elementary school teachers. However, we can say that this kind of person does not understand education. Although teaching is hard, it is quite important, and especially so for elementary school teachers. Since elementary school is the beginning of education, if the teachers are not good, the negative impact will be irreparable. At the same time, the curriculum of elementary schools is multifaceted, and the psychology of children is somewhat specially structured. If one is not rich in common sense and does not have special research on child psychology, one is not competent. Therefore, here we feel that the failure of generally qualified elementary school teachers to teach is an error of the general "climbing up" psychology. As a result, the corruption and abuse of elementary school teachers has become one of the reasons for the current corruption of elementary school education.</p>
<p>However, we cannot completely blame them. The main issue is still the treatment of elementary school teachers. Not long ago, we heard about a teacher in Xuzhou committing suicide from starvation. As for arrears in salary, or the lack of security, there are too many to count. In Shanghai, it is even more terrible. An elementary school teacher is often worse off than a worker. Not to mention the salary, even the food is not necessarily the treatment of a human being. That's right, how can you teach when you are hungry? Who would want to be an elementary school teacher?</p>
<p>Now the qualifications of teachers are restricted. Treatment, guarantee, etc. are all stipulated in official documents. However, what we need is implementation, not just another piece of paper, a blank check to deceive the common people sitting on the cold bench into being happy.</p>

<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>Here, the stool was pulled over, and all kinds of people seemed to be watching a special spectacle, surrounding them in layers. The woman wearing silk trousers and a silk jacket, with a face full of pockmarks, and lips so thin that no red could be seen, but eyes with an unusual brilliance, rolling around. The sunlight had devoured her fair skin, which, like her clothes, had a layer of bright light. What about the one behind? Not saying a word. Waving a banana leaf fan, the wind hitting the two of them, needless to say, that was an assistant.</p>
<p>Spreading out her hand, she looked at the crisscrossing lines, guessed at her age, and carefully examined her facial features, rolling her eyes a few times, according to her usual secret—a golden hand and a jade hand, take it and go, your hand, the lines are intertwined into gold, you don't have to worry about wearing and using, treat people kindly, but don't get good rewards. She paused for a moment, and asked, what does your husband do?</p>
<p>The woman's face turned red, and she lowered her head. The people around were snickering. Someone, not knowing who, said on her behalf: "She's not married yet!"</p>
<p>—In terms of appearance, you should have happy events this year. Your parents cultivated virtue when you were fifteen or sixteen, and you cultivated virtue yourself when you were in your early twenties. However, in August—her eyes rolled again, calculating the number in her mind, there are three things to avoid: you can't eat red things, you can't look in the mirror, and you can't dry your clothes in the sun. These can have a direct impact on your destiny with a good match—understand?</p>
<p>Of course, she understood. Then—what day is it exactly? The woman believed it and asked.</p>
<p>—I don't know the hour. She was smiling in her heart. The hour needs to be deduced to be known.</p>
<p>Needless to say, face reading does not involve "deduction." To deduce, there must be a considerable price. Finally, she was disappointed, smashed everything completely, opened her dazed eyes, and asked tentatively: Does anyone want to have their face read? Do you read children's faces?</p>
<p>—Why doesn't that one read faces? I couldn't help but ask: How much do you earn a day doing this?</p>
<p>—She is a camel, it only works if you lead her. Earning a living? Unreliable, it depends entirely on luck.</p>
<p>They left, their hearts tightly bitten by the needs of life. Face reading? Destiny? Why doesn't she make her own destiny better? Those left in the alley were having different discussions!</p>

Fishermen, woodcutters, farmers, and scholars fill the town. Hermits often emerge from the deep mountains. Thatched gates and wattle doors pass the days. Most of them are detached and leisurely people. They secretly grieve while reciting poetry under the moon. There is a handsome and brave young firewood cutter. He is actually Zeng Shen, a virtuous man who carries firewood into the mountains. He studies Confucian teachings under people and takes utmost care in serving his mother with filial piety. Everyone in the village knows about the filial son Zeng. His good reputation spreads throughout the town. One day, Zeng Shen went to the mountains with an axe. To chop wood and buy rice for his filial mother. Unexpectedly, a guest arrived at his home. Zeng's mother didn't know how to entertain the guest. Ashamed, she had no good plan. Having neither wine nor food nor money. Hoping her son would return quickly, but he was nowhere to be seen. Her heart was anxious, what to do? Knowing that blood is thicker than water, the mother and son are connected. Their breaths resonate with each other. She broke her finger and bit it with a ruthless heart. In Zeng Shen's heart,</p>

<p>the pain was unbearable. Carrying firewood, he hurried home. He knelt down and asked his mother what was the matter. Zeng's mother then began to speak. Just now, a guest came to our humble home. Because you haven't returned, there was little to entertain them. Therefore, I bit my finger to send a message for you to return. What a wise and filial Zeng! Such people are rare, and their feelings are profound. It's hard to describe in words; I hope you understand, sir.</p>

<p>Daiyu's charm remains undiminished. Gradually, her spirit has recovered. She doesn't add extra adornments to her hair. Her silk clothes hang loosely on her slender waist. That Bin Yu secretly observed her first. Then, she gently used her voice to offer comfort. At this time, the autumn colors beyond the screen are beautiful. The ashes of medicine burn out, and new poems are written by the door. Look at this, the shadow on the gauze window is a natural painting. The silver candle's autumn light is a superb verse. If you deliberately stay in bed alone, I'm afraid Chang'e will laugh at your foolishness. Yingchun and her sisters smiled knowingly. Saying that one should enjoy life while it lasts. She ordered Zijuan to quickly arrange a small feast. The sisters sat in order, each taking their place without declining. The aroma of incense spread, and the golden goblets were filled. Her radiant writing flowed effortlessly. Daiyu was, however, penalized with the golden goblet. Her fair face was already flushed. Leaning on the railing, she tried to gaze at the moon in the sky. It was perfectly round and flawless at this fine time. The cold dew lightly veiled the branches of the flowers.</p>

<p>"Opening Chapter: Autumn Night Insect Sounds Publication" (Mimi Collection Inaugural Issue)</p>
<p>The autumn moon hangs over the treetops. The four walls are filled with the loneliness of autumn accompanied by insect sounds. My mother is at her spinning wheel, working tirelessly. Choosing threads and weaving is truly too exhausting. We should promote short-term labor associations. Establish preferential regulations. To prevent her from braving the cold and enduring the long, leaking nights. Calling "Brother," until her voice is hoarse. She frantically calls for her brother. Calling until her tongue is dry and her lips are parched. It's difficult, as her brother remains unseen. Causing her to carry this lifelong longing without letting go. Could it be that Brother Money's whereabouts have been distant for a long time? Could it be that news from Mexico has vanished after his departure? Therefore, her cries are loud in the middle of the night. Far away, crickets encounter much misfortune. Children pick at the cracks in the brick, searching diligently, unwilling to stop. They capture you and lock you in a tile pot, refusing to release you. Little do you know that you are being exploited for human benefit. Instead, you brandish your teeth and claws, harming your own kind. You read about battles and mutual slaughter. Showing off power and bragging about being heroes. They take advantage of others' misfortune like their kind. They are the ones who flee in defeat without a fight. Such compatriots are worthy of a deep sigh. They don't think of uniting; truly terrible. If they don't unite to resist external threats, they will regret it. I fear they won't be able to protect the beautiful land. The autumn night insect sounds are plaintive, like heavy rain echoing in the empty sky. Every sound tells of a sad and sorrowful composition. The pauses and inflections are difficult to describe. Just look at the human world and the insect world. Aren't they the same, both in a chaotic mess? Making people feel a thousand sorrows and ten thousand resentments in their hearts.</p>

<p>The tyrant we know well from history – Qin Shi Huang. At that time, he burned books and buried scholars alive. He used a brutal and dictatorial system to oppress our people. The people were oppressed to the point of having no way out, so the flames of resistance burned among them! However, their subconscious was imprisoned by the iron bricks of feudalism, preventing them from uniting the strength of the masses.</p>
<p>Xiang Yu, the overlord who served as a personal hero, saw this point. The lure of individual heroic status made him want to seize Qin Shi Huang's throne and replace him. So he raised a new, appealing revolutionary banner of overthrowing Qin Shi Huang, deceiving some of the laboring masses into mutually slaughtering and sacrificing themselves to win his own throne.</p>
<p>The laboring masses eagerly wanted to gain their own freedom and liberation! They were finally obscured and deceived by this attractive slogan, bravely overthrowing Qin Shi Huang who "burned books and buried scholars alive."</p>
<p>Qin Shi Huang was overthrown.</p>
<p>However, the revolution can also be considered a success. However, it was gradually revealed that a new, more brutal and more lewd demon was emerging!</p>
<p>What is unfolding here is that Xiang Yu's soldiers are realizing their own position and disregarding the sacrifice of their lives for Xiang Yu's personal quest for position and territory; they are uniting to oppose war! - To abolish war!</p>
<p>In the struggle for territory, Xiang Yu's own Chu state was largely occupied by Liu Bang and his forces. As midnight approached, the Han army of Liu Bang and his forces surrounded them on all sides, and from time to time some tragic songs of the Chu state drifted from their camps. The songs also aroused the homesickness of the brothers who could not return to the Chu state, and they felt as if they had lost something.</p>
<p>The overlord Xiang Yu was also eroded by these songs, and feeling restless, he grabbed his sword and went out madly, intending to intimidate and drive back the songs that were spreading...</p>
<p>This time, the soldiers were determined not to fight for Xiang Yu anymore. The guard Luo Ping was a young man with clear awareness. He and his companion Hu De, along with several other brothers, were made central figures and appeared in front of the camp to discuss the steps of launching an anti-war and peace-seeking movement of 100,000 brothers.</p>
<p>The beloved concubine of the overlord Xiang Yu—Yu Ji, although she used her charm to gain the favor of this demon, her physiological needs made her fall in love with the young guard Luo Ping. She was a young lady born into a noble family. Although she had a new and great style attached to her, she was still quite attached to the old, forming a dual conflicting psychology.</p>
<p>She protected Xiang Yu's life in order to repay Xiang Yu. But Luo Ping resolutely said: "It's either love or hate. If you stand with us, that means you don't love him, that means you hate him! Otherwise! Then you are our enemy!" This left her disappointed and "unable to argue."</p>
<p>On the one hand, Xiang Yu, this demon, in the instant of his impending demise, went out and acted wildly for a while before returning. He still had to drink and make merry. When the brothers raised the banner of anti-war righteousness together, it was like a final sacrifice for him... Although he still wanted to struggle!</p>
<p>"Sir... we are here to convey our opinions... All of us brothers are now enlightened! In the past, you tricked us into overthrowing Qin Shi Huang! Calling it "revolution!" But now that the "revolution" has succeeded, the peace we hoped for cannot be seen! And your fox tails have been revealed! The demon who slaughtered and plundered the people: the demon who oppressed the people was just overthrown, and you replaced him as an even more cruel and more lewd demon: we could have obtained peace! But you have driven us into an even more brutal and deadly war! Letting our blood build up your throne, and using our skulls to carve your crowns; you fight for power and profit, but we fly through the air in pieces, you wear brocade and eat delicacies, but we are hungry and cold! We are about to be destroyed, but you are still fighting endlessly! Sir! We are no longer willing to fill your bottomless desire pit with our limited bones! Now I tell you... the 100,000 remaining lives of us! In order to create a future society! We will no longer be your sacrifices, we will no longer fight for you!" ... They roared consciously! Making rulers like Xiang Yu tremble in front of the masses!</p>
<p>"This is the power of our masses!"</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>However, Yu Ji, struggling in a dual psychological conflict, replaced the young Luo Ping and sacrificed herself meaninglessly under the sword of the demon Xiang Yu...</p>

<p>Pain beyond compare. Carrying firewood, he hastily returned home. He knelt, imploring his mother for the reason. Zeng's mother then explained. A guest arrived at our humble door. Because you had not returned, I had little with which to entertain them. Therefore, I bit my finger, signaling for your return. What a virtuous and filial Zeng! Such people are rare, their emotions profound. Difficult to express in words; I hope you understand, sir.</p>

<p>Opening "Small Feast in the Red Chamber" (Inaugural issue of Mimi Collection)</p>
<p>Daiyu's grace remains undiminished. Gradually her spirit recovers. Not adding extra hair accessories. Loose silk garments revealing her slender waist. That Bin Yu first noticed. Gently comforting her with tender words. As this panel is with autumn colors so beautiful. The lingering aroma of medicine, poetry at the door. Look, that window screen is a natural painting. The silver candle's autumn light, exquisite words. If you continue to lie alone on the bed, I fear Chang'e will see and laugh at your foolishness. Yingchun and sisters laughed together. Saying that enjoying life is a must. Ordered Zujuan to prepare the small feast. The sisters sat respectfully. Fragrant incense fills the air, golden cups filled. Brilliant paper, effortless thoughts. Daiyu was however penalized with a cup. Her fair face already flushed. Leaning on the railing, testing a glance at the moon. Perfection, not at all flawed. Cold dew dimly moistens the flower branches.</p>
<p>Zhou Zhenyu's Righteous Demon Tale</p>
<p>Yuanchang (1120) Midnight 0:45 to 1:30 AM</p>
<p>"Opening Night's Insect Sounds" (Inaugural issue of Mimi Collection)</p>
<p>A solitary autumn moon upon the treetops. Four walls of autumn accompanied by lonely insects. Mother is ceaselessly at her spinning wheel. Picking threads and weaving is truly exhausting. One should advocate for shorter working hours. Stipulating preferential regulations. Lest she be chilled by the cool air, the long night all leaking away. Calling "Brother", eventually... haphazardly calling for "Brother". Calling until her tongue is dry and lips are parched. Sadly, her brother is nowhere to be seen. She clings to this lasting concern, unwilling to let go. Could it be that Brother Money's tracks have grown distant? Or perhaps all news from Mexico has vanished? Thus in the middle of the night the shouts are loud. Far off crickets encounter great misfortune. Children seek in the brick cracks, unwilling to give up. Catching and trapping you in a tile pot, not setting you free. Not realizing you are being used. Instead flexing fangs and claws harming your kind. Examining battles and mutual slaughter. Vaunting power and bravery. Seizing another's moment of weakness, like their type. They are routed and flee. Such compatriots are lamentable. Failing to unite, truly a disaster. Unless they unite and resist outside threats, it is feared they cannot keep this great land. Autumn night's insect sounds are keen, like torrential rain echoing in the empty sky. Each sound conveys sorrowful melodies, nuanced and soaring, difficult to describe. Just look at the human world and the insect world. Are they not the same, an utter mess. Making people feel a thousand sorrows and ten thousand regrets.</p>

<p>Yu Ji</p>
<p>The tyrant well known throughout history - Qin Shi Huang. At that time, he burned books and buried scholars. Employing a brutal authoritarian system, oppressing our people. The people, oppressed until there was no path left. Thus amongst them, anger burned. However, their subconscious was constrained by feudal iron walls, preventing them from unifying the people's strength.</p>
<p>As the personal heroic overlord - Xiang Yu, saw this. The selfish desire for heroic glory made him want to usurp the throne from Qin Shi Huang. Thus he raised a new seductive banner to overthrow Qin Shi Huang, deceiving some of the common people, for them to slaughter each other, to be sacrificed, for him to fight for his own throne.</p>
<p>The common people wished urgently to gain their own freedom and liberation! Finally, they were deceived and misled by this sweet sounding slogan, bravely overthrowing Qin Shi Huang who “burned books and buried scholars”.</p>
<p>Qin Shi Huang was overthrown.</p>
<p>However, the revolution was also considered a success. However, it was gradually becoming apparent that a new demon, even more cruel and lewd, was appearing!</p>
<p>What is being revealed here is that Xiang Yu's soldiers were realizing their own position and ignoring sacrificing themselves for Xiang Yu's personal battle for position and territory. Unifying themselves to oppose war! – To abolish war!</p>
<p>To fight for territory, Xiang Yu’s homeland of Chu had already been occupied in a large part by Liu Bang and his forces. As midnight approaches, the Han army of Liu Bang and his forces are surrounding them on all sides, and at times from their camps, there floated tragic songs of the Chu homeland, that aroused the emotions of the brothers who cannot return to Chu. Feeling as if they had lost something.</p>
<p>The overlord Xiang Yu also became corroded by these songs, becoming restless he took his sword and went out madly, attempting to scare away those diffusing songs…</p>
<p>This time, the soldier brothers had resolved to no longer fight for Xiang Yu. The guard Luo Ping was a young man with clear understanding, he and his companion Hu De and a few other brothers were made the central figures, appearing before the curtain to discuss the steps to launch a mass anti-war movement seeking peace for the hundred thousand brothers.</p>
<p>The beloved concubine of the overlord Xiang Yu - Yu Ji, although she used her seductive charms to obtain the joy of this demon, her physiological desires made her fall in love with the young guard Luo Ping. She was a young lady born into a noble family, although she had a new and great style attached to her, she was still quite attached to the old, forming a dual conflicting psychology.</p>
<p>She protected Xiang Yu’s life, as repayment to Xiang Yu. But Luo Ping firmly said: “It is either love or hate. If you stand with us, that means you don’t love him, that means you hate him! Otherwise! Then you are our enemy!” Which left her disappointed and “unable to argue.”</p>
<p>On one hand, Xiang Yu this demon, at the instant of his impending fall, went out to boast and show off for a time before returning. Still needing to drink and make merry… When the brothers all together raised the righteous flag of anti-war, it was as if they were making a final sacrifice. … Although he still wanted to struggle!</p>
<p>“Sir… we have come to convey our opinions… All of us brothers now are awakened! Before, you deceived us into overthrowing Qin Shi Huang! Calling it “revolution!” But: now that “revolution” has succeeded, the peace that we wished for cannot be seen! And your fox tail has been revealed! Slaughtering the people, plundering the people: the demon who oppressed the people had only just been overthrown, and you have replaced him to become an even more cruel and more lewd demon: We could have obtained peace! But instead, you have driven us into an even more brutal, towards destruction in war! Allowing our blood to build your throne, using our skulls to carve your crowns; you fight for power and gain, while we are torn to pieces, you wear fine clothes and have delicious food, while we are cold and starving! We are on the verge of destruction, but you are still engaged in endless battles! Sir! We are no longer willing to fill your bottomless pit of desire with our limited bones! I tell you now… the remaining 100,000 lives of us! In order to create a future society! We will no longer be your sacrifices, we will no longer fight for you!” … Also consciously roaring! Causing rulers of Xiang Yu’s kind to tremble before the masses!</p>
<p>“This is the power of our masses!”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>However, Yu Ji, while struggling with her dual psychological conflict, replaced the young Luo Ping and meaninglessly sacrificed herself under the sword of the demon Xiang Yu…</p>
